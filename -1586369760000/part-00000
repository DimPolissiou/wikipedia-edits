Scorsese was raised in a predominantly [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] environment.<ref name=\"NYTbio\" /> As a boy, he had [[asthma]] and could not play sports or take part in any activities with other children, so his parents and his older brother would often take him to movie theaters; it was at this stage in his life that he developed a passion for cinema. As a teenager in the Bronx, Scorsese frequently rented [[Powell and Pressburger]]'s ''[[The Tales of Hoffmann (film)|The Tales of Hoffmann]]'' (1951) from a store that had one copy of the reel. Scorsese was one of only two people who regularly rented it; the other was future film director [[George A.

Scorsese also developed an admiration for neorealist cinema at this time. He recounted its influence in a documentary on [[Italian neorealism]], and commented on how ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'', ''[[Rome, Open City]]'' and especially ''[[Pais\u00e0]]'' inspired him and influenced his view or portrayal of his Sicilian roots. In his documentary, ''[[Il Mio Viaggio in Italia]]'' (''My Voyage to Italy''), Scorsese noted that the Sicilian episode of [[Roberto Rossellini]]'s ''Pais\u00e0'', which he first saw on television with his relatives who were themselves Sicilian immigrants, had a significant impact on his life.<ref name=\"hatchet\" /> He acknowledges owing a great debt to the [[French New Wave]] and has stated

By now the signature Scorsese style was in place: macho posturing, bloody violence, Catholic guilt and redemption, gritty New York locale (though the majority of ''Mean Streets'' was shot in Los Angeles), rapid-fire editing and a soundtrack with contemporary music.

This tribute to Scorsese's home town and the classic Hollywood musical was a box-office failure. The film was the director's third collaboration with Robert De Niro, co-starring with [[Liza Minnelli]]. The film is best remembered today for the title theme song, which was popularized by [[Frank Sinatra]]. Although possessing Scorsese's usual visual panache and stylistic bravura, many critics felt its enclosed studio-bound atmosphere left it leaden in comparison with his earlier work. Despite its weak reception, the film is regarded positively by some critics. Richard Brody in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote: {{quote|For Scorsese, a lifelong cinephile, the essence of New York could be found in its depiction in classic Hollywood movies.

By this stage the director had  developed a serious [[cocaine]] addiction. However, he did find the creative drive to make the highly regarded ''[[The Last Waltz]]'', documenting the final concert by [[The Band]]. It was held at the [[Winterland Ballroom]] in San Francisco on American Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1976, and featured one of the most extensive lineups of prominent guest performers at a single concert, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[Neil Young]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Paul Butterfield]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Ronnie Wood]], and [[Eric Clapton]]. However, Scorsese's commitments to other projects delayed the release of the film until 1978. Another Scorsese-directed documentary, titled ''[[American Boy: A Profile of Steven Prince|American Boy]]'', also appeared in 1978, focusing on Steven Prince, the cocky gun salesman who appeared in ''Taxi Driver''. A period of wild partying followed, damaging the director's already fragile health. Scorsese helped provide footage for the documentary ''[[Elvis on Tour]]''. Before the end of 1979, Scorsese married actress [[Isabella Rossellini]], and they stayed together for four years until their divorce in 1983.<ref>{{cite news |last=Halpern |first=Dan |title=Interview: Isabella Rossellini \u2013 Daddy's girl |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/may/01/features.features11 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |date=April 30, 2006 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418234306/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/may/01/features.features11 |archivedate=April 18, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== 1980s ===\nBy several accounts (Scorsese's included), Robert De Niro practically saved Scorsese's life when he persuaded him to kick his cocaine addiction to make his highly regarded film ''[[Raging Bull]]''.

It is a [[satire]] on the world of media and celebrity, whose central character is a troubled loner who ironically becomes famous through a criminal act ([[kidnapping]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.timeout.com/film/78730.html |title=The King of Comedy Film Review |publisher=Timeout.com |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110220949/http://www.timeout.com/film/78730.html |archivedate=January 10, 2008}}</ref> The film was an obvious departure from the more emotionally committed films he had become associated with.

It still bore many of Scorsese's trademarks, however. The ''King of Comedy'' failed at the box office, but has become increasingly well regarded by critics in the years since its release. German director [[Wim Wenders]] numbered it among his 15 favorite films.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wim-wenders.com/news_reel/2002/apr02-directorsonfilm.htm |title=The Official Site |publisher=[[Wim Wenders]] |accessdate=March 3, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020618113722/http://www.wim-wenders.com/news_reel/2002/apr02-directorsonfilm.htm|archive-date=June 18, 2002}}</ref> Also, in 1983, Scorsese made a brief [[cameo appearance]] in the film ''[[Anna Pavlova (film)|Anna Pavlova]]'' (also known as ''A Woman for All Time''), originally intended to be directed by one of his heroes, [[Michael Powell]]. This led to a more significant acting appearance in [[Bertrand Tavernier]]'s [[jazz]] film ''[[Round Midnight (film)|Round Midnight]]''. He also made a brief venture into television, directing an episode of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]''.\n\nWith ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' (1985), Scorsese made an esthetic shift back to a pared-down, almost \"underground\" film-making style. Filmed on an extremely low budget, on location, and at night in the [[SoHo]] neighborhood of Manhattan, the film is a black comedy about one increasingly misfortunate night for a mild New York word processor ([[Griffin Dunne]]) and features cameos by such disparate actors as [[Teri Garr]] and [[Cheech and Chong]]. Along with the 1987 [[Michael Jackson]] music video \"[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)#Music video|Bad]]\", in 1986 Scorsese made ''[[The Color of Money]]'', a sequel to the much admired [[Robert Rossen]] film ''[[The Hustler (film)|The Hustler]]'' (1961) with [[Paul Newman]], which co-starred [[Tom Cruise]]. Although adhering to Scorsese's established style, ''The Color of Money'' was the director's first official foray into [[mainstream]] film-making. The film finally won actor Paul Newman an Oscar and gave Scorsese the clout to finally secure backing for a project that had been a longtime goal for him: ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]''.\n\nIn 1983, Scorsese began work on this long-cherished personal project. ''The Last Temptation of Christ'', based on the [[The Last Temptation of Christ|1951 novel]] written by [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], retold the life of [[Christ]] in human rather than divine terms. [[Barbara Hershey]] recalls introducing Scorsese to the book while they were filming ''Boxcar Bertha''.<ref name=TCM>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=194050 |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |title=Boxcar Bertha |accessdate=November 17, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006002322/http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=194050 |archivedate=October 6, 2010}}</ref> The film was slated to shoot under the [[Paramount Pictures]] banner, but shortly before principal photography was to start, Paramount pulled the plug on the project, citing pressure from religious groups. In this aborted 1983 version, [[Aidan Quinn]] was cast as Jesus, and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] was cast as [[Pontius Pilate]]. (In the 1988 version, these roles were played by [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[David Bowie]] respectively.) However, following his mid-1980s flirtation with commercial Hollywood, Scorsese made a major return to personal filmmaking with the project, which was ultimately released in 1988. Even prior to its release, the film (adapted by ''Taxi Driver'' and ''Raging Bull'' veteran Paul Schrader) caused a massive furor, with worldwide protests against its perceived [[blasphemy]] effectively turning a low-budget independent film into a media sensation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/flashpoints/theater/lasttemptation.html |title=Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ |publisher=[[Pbs.org]] |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830074627/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/flashpoints/theater/lasttemptation.html |archivedate=August 30, 2010}}</ref> Most of the controversy centered on the final passages of the film, which depicted Christ marrying and raising a family with [[Mary Magdalene]] in a [[Satan]]-induced [[hallucination]] while on the cross.\n\nLooking past the controversy, ''The Last Temptation of Christ'' gained critical acclaim and remains an important work in Scorsese's canon: an explicit attempt to wrestle with the spirituality underpinning his films up until that point. The director went on to receive his second nomination for a Best Director Academy Award (again unsuccessfully, this time losing to [[Barry Levinson]] for ''[[Rain Man]]''). Scorsese then married producer [[Barbara De Fina]] in 1985, his fourth of five marriages; their marriage ended in divorce in 1991. As a separate film project, and along with directors [[Woody Allen]] and Francis Ford Coppola in 1989, Scorsese provided one of three segments in the portmanteau film ''[[New York Stories]]'', called \"Life Lessons\".\n\n=== 1990s ===\n[[File:Scorsese 01.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Martin Scorsese in 1995]]\nAfter a decade of films considered by critics to be mostly mixed results, Scorsese's gangster epic ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990) was considered his return to directorial form, and his most confident and fully realized film since ''Raging Bull''. De Niro and [[Joe Pesci]] offered a virtuoso display of Scorsese's bravura cinematic technique in the film and re-established, enhanced, and consolidated his reputation. After the film was released, [[Roger Ebert]], a friend and supporter of Scorsese, named ''Goodfellas'' \"the best mob movie ever\". It is ranked No. 1 on Ebert's movie list for 1990, along with those of [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Peter Travers]]', and is widely considered one of the director's greatest achievements.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19900902/REVIEWS/9020301/1023 |title=:: rogerebert.com :: Reviews :: GoodFellas (xhtml) |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=September 2, 1990 |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730045115/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19900902%2FREVIEWS%2F9020301%2F1023 |archivedate=July 30, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000623089 |title=GoodFellas |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date= |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050206091630/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000623089 |archivedate=February 6, 2005 |first=Stephen |last=Dalton |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/goodf.html |title=GoodFellas (1990) |publisher=Filmsite.org |date= |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110122117/http://www.filmsite.org/goodf.html |archivedate=January 10, 2010}}</ref> The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and Scorsese earned his third Best Director nomination but again lost to a first-time director, [[Kevin Costner]] (''[[Dances with Wolves]]''). Joe Pesci earned the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance. Scorsese and the film also won a number of other awards, including five [[BAFTA]] Awards, a [[Silver Lion]] and more. The American Film Institute placed ''Goodfellas'' at No. 94 on the AFI's 100 Years&nbsp;... 100 Movies list. On the 2007 updated version, they moved ''Goodfellas'' up to No. 92 on the AFI's 100 Years&nbsp;... 100 Movies list (10th Anniversary Edition) and put ''Goodfellas'' at No. 2 on [[AFI's 10 Top 10#Gangster|their list of the top 10 gangster films]] (after ''[[The Godfather]]'').\n\nIn 1990, he released his only short-form documentary: ''[[Made in Milan]]'' about fashion designer [[Giorgio Armani]]. The following year brought ''[[Cape Fear (1991 film)|Cape Fear]]'', a remake of a cult [[Cape Fear (1962 film)|1962 movie]] of the same name and the director's seventh collaboration with De Niro. Another foray into the mainstream, the film was a stylized thriller taking its cues heavily from [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Charles Laughton]]'s ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'' (1955). ''Cape Fear'' received a mixed critical reception and was lambasted in many quarters for its scenes depicting [[misogynistic]] violence. However, the lurid subject matter gave Scorsese a chance to experiment with visual tricks and effects. The film garnered two Oscar nominations. Earning $80 million domestically, it stood as Scorsese's most commercially successful release until ''The Aviator'' (2004), and then ''The Departed'' (2006). The film also marked the first time Scorsese used wide-screen Panavision with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1. Throughout the early 1990s until 1997, Scorsese actively dated actress [[Illeana Douglas]] following his third divorce.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://people.com/archive/note-worthy-vol-51-no-8/ |title=Note Worthy|first= Dan|last= Jewel|date= March 1, 1999|work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |access-date=October 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181025225552/https://people.com/archive/note-worthy-vol-51-no-8/ |archive-date=October 25, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Scorsese acted in a small role as [[Vincent van Gogh]] in the film ''[[Dreams (1990 film)|Dreams]]'' by Japanese director [[Akira Kurosawa]]. Scorsese's 1994 cameo appearance in the Robert Redford film ''Quiz Show'' is remembered for the telling line: \"You see, the audience didn't tune in to watch some amazing display of intellectual ability. They just wanted to watch the money.\" De Fina-Cappa was the production company he formed that same year with producer Barbara De Fina.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://letterboxd.com/studio/de-fina-cappa |title=Films produced by De Fina-Cappa |work=[[Letterboxd]] |accessdate=November 15, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903011625/http://letterboxd.com/studio/de-fina-cappa/ |archivedate=September 3, 2014}}</ref> In the early 1990s, Scorsese also expanded his role as a film producer. He produced a wide range of films, including major Hollywood studio productions (''[[Mad Dog and Glory]]'', ''[[Clockers (film)|Clockers]]''), low-budget independent films (''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]'', ''[[Naked in New York]]'', ''[[Grace of My Heart]]'', ''[[Search and Destroy]]'', ''[[The Hi-Lo Country]]''), and even the foreign film (''[[Con gli occhi chiusi]]'' (With Closed Eyes)).\n\n[[File:Martin Scorsese 03.jpg|thumb|left|Scorsese in 1995]]\n\n''The Age of Innocence'' (1993) was a significant departure for Scorsese, a period adaptation of the [[Edith Wharton]] [[The Age of Innocence|novel]] about the constrictive high society of late-19th century New York. It was highly lauded by critics upon its original release but was a [[box office bomb]], making an overall loss. As noted in ''Scorsese on Scorsese'' by editor\u2013interviewer Ian Christie, the news that Scorsese wanted to make a film about a failed 19th-century romance raised many eyebrows among the film fraternity; all the more when Scorsese made it clear that it was a personal project and not a studio for-hire job.\n\nScorsese was interested in doing a \"romantic piece\", and he was strongly drawn to the characters and the story of Wharton's text. Scorsese wanted his film to be as rich an emotional experience as the book was to him rather than the traditional academic adaptations of literary works. To this end, Scorsese sought influence from diverse period films that had had an emotional impact on him. In ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', he documents influences from films such as [[Luchino Visconti]]'s ''[[Senso (film)|Senso]]'' and his ''[[The Leopard (1963 film)|Il Gattopardo]]'' (The Leopard) as well as [[Orson Welles]]'s ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' and also Roberto Rossellini's ''[[La prise de pouvoir par Louis&nbsp;XIV]]'' (The Taking of Power by Louis&nbsp;XIV). Although ''The Age of Innocence'' was ultimately different from these films in terms of narrative, story, and thematic concern, the presence of a lost society, of lost values as well as detailed re-creations of social customs and rituals continues the tradition of these films. It came back into the public eye, especially in countries such as the UK and France, but still is largely neglected in North America. The film earned five Academy Award nominations (including  Best Adapted Screenplay for Scorsese), winning the Costume Design Oscar. This was his first collaboration with the Academy Award-winning actor [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], with whom he would work again on ''Gangs of New York''.\n\n''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]'' (1995), like ''The Age of Innocence'' before it, focused on a tightly wound male whose well-ordered life is disrupted by the arrival of unpredictable forces. The fact that it was a violent gangster film made it more palatable to the director's fans who perhaps were baffled by the apparent departure of the earlier film. ''Casino'' was a box office success,<ref name=\"variety-gross\">{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/andrew-garfield-to-star-in-martin-scorseses-silence-exclusive-1200470625/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Scott |last=Foundas |title=Andrew Garfield to Star in Martin Scorsese's 'Silence' (EXCLUSIVE) |date=May 7, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430081104/http://variety.com/2013/film/news/andrew-garfield-to-star-in-martin-scorseses-silence-exclusive-1200470625/ |archivedate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> but the film received mixed-to-positive notices from critics. In large part this was due to its significant stylistic similarities to his earlier ''Goodfellas'', and its excessive violence, which garnered it a reputation as possibly the most violent American gangster film. Indeed, many of the tropes and tricks of the earlier film resurfaced more or less intact, most obviously the casting of both Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, with Pesci once again playing an unbridled psychopath. [[Sharon Stone]] was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress Academy Award]] for her performance. During the filming, Scorsese played a background part as a gambler at one of the tables.\n\nScorsese still found time for a four-hour documentary in 1995, titled ''[[A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies]]'', offering a thorough trek through American cinema. It covered the silent era to 1969, a year after which Scorsese began his feature career. He said, \"I wouldn't feel right commenting on myself or my contemporaries.\" In the four-hour documentary, Scorsese lists the four aspects of the director he believes are the most important as (1) the director as storyteller; (2) the director as an illusionist: D. W. Griffith or F. W. Murnau, who created new editing techniques among other innovations that made the appearance of sound and color possible later on; (3) the director as a smuggler\u2014filmmakers such as [[Douglas Sirk]], Samuel Fuller, and [[Vincente Minnelli]], who used to hide subversive messages in their films; and (4) the director as iconoclast. In the preface to this documentary, Scorsese states his commitment to the \"Director's Dilemma\", in which a successful contemporary director must be pragmatic about the realities of getting financing for films of personal esthetic interest by accepting the need of \"making one film for the studio, and (then) making one for oneself.\"\n\nIf ''The Age of Innocence'' alienated and confused some fans, then ''[[Kundun]]'' (1997) went several steps further, offering an account of the early life of [[Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama]], the [[People's Liberation Army]]'s entry into [[Tibet]], and the Dalai Lama's subsequent exile to India. Not only a departure in subject matter, ''Kundun'' saw Scorsese employing a fresh narrative and visual approach. Traditional dramatic devices were substituted for a trance-like meditation achieved through an elaborate [[tableau vivant|tableau]] of colorful visual images.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.timeout.com/film/78857.html |title=Kundun |magazine=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110232624/http://www.timeout.com/film/78857.html |archivedate=January 10, 2008}}</ref> The film was a source of turmoil for its distributor, [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]], which was planning significant expansion into the Chinese market at the time. Initially defiant in the face of pressure from Chinese officials, Disney has since distanced itself from the project, hurting ''Kundun''{{'}}s commercial profile. In the short term, the sheer eclecticism in evidence enhanced the director's reputation. In the long term, however, it appears ''Kundun'' has been sidelined in most critical appraisals of the director, mostly noted as a stylistic and thematic detour. ''Kundun'' was the Scorsese's second attempt to profile the life of a great religious leader, following ''The Last Temptation of Christ''.\n\n''Bringing Out the Dead'' (1999) was a return to familiar territory, with the director and writer Paul Schrader constructing a pitch-black comic take on their own earlier ''Taxi Driver''.<ref>{{cite web |title=New York Stories: A Complete Ranking of Martin Scorsese's Films Read More: Ranking Martin Scorsese's Movies From Best to Worst |url=https://screencrush.com/scorsese-list/ |publisher=[[Screen Crush]] |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428142744/http://screencrush.com/scorsese-list/ |archivedate=April 28, 2014}}</ref> Like previous Scorsese-Schrader collaborations, its final scenes of spiritual redemption explicitly recalls the films of Robert Bresson.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol4-2000/n12reinert |title=Reinert on Bringing Out the Dead |publisher=Film-philosophy.com |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174544/http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol4-2000/n12reinert |archivedate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> (It is also worth noting that the film's incident-filled nocturnal setting is reminiscent of ''After Hours''.)

The documentary foreshadowed the director's next project, the epic ''Gangs of New York'' (2002), influenced by (amongst many others) major Italian directors such as Luchino Visconti and filmed in its entirety at Rome's famous [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] film studios. With a production budget said to be in excess of $100 million, ''Gangs of New York'' was Scorsese's biggest and arguably most mainstream venture to date. Like ''The Age of Innocence'', it was set in 19th-century New York, although focusing on the other end of the social scale (and like that film, also starring Daniel Day-Lewis). The film marked the first collaboration between Scorsese and actor [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], who became a fixture in later Scorsese films.

Seven film-makers including Wim Wenders, [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Mike Figgis]], and Scorsese himself each contributed a 90-minute film (Scorsese's entry was titled ''Feel Like Going Home''). In the early 2000s, Scorsese produced several films for up-and-coming directors, such as ''[[You Can Count on Me]]'' (directed by [[Kenneth Lonergan]]), ''Rain'' (directed by Katherine Lindberg), ''[[Lymelife]]'' (directed by [[Derick Martini]]) and ''[[The Young Victoria]]'' (directed by [[Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e]]).

The film does not cover Dylan's entire career; it focuses on his beginnings, his rise to fame in the 1960s, his then-[[Electric Dylan controversy|controversial transformation]] from an acoustic guitar-based musician and performer to an electric guitar-influenced sound and his \"retirement\" from touring in 1966 following an infamous motorcycle accident. The film was first presented on television in both the United States (as part of the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] ''[[American Masters]]'' series) and the United Kingdom (as part of the [[BBC Two]] ''[[Arena (UK TV series)|Arena]]'' series) on September 26 to 27, 2005.

This effect can be seen in ''Casino'' (it is used on Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci), ''Life Lessons'', ''The Departed'' (on Matt Damon), and ''Hugo''. Some of his films include references/allusions to Westerns, particularly ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'', ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'', ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'', ''[[The Searchers]]'', and ''[[The Oklahoma Kid]]''. Slow motion flashbulbs and accented camera/flash/shutter sounds are often used, as is the song \"[[Gimme Shelter]]\" by The Rolling Stones heard in several of Scorsese's films: ''Goodfellas'', ''Casino'', and ''The Departed''.\n\n===Cameo appearances===\nScorsese usually has a quick cameo in his films (''Who's That Knocking at My Door'', ''Boxcar Bertha'', ''Mean Streets'', ''Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore'', ''Taxi Driver'', ''The King of Comedy'', ''After Hours'', ''The Last Temptation of Christ'' (albeit hidden under a hood), ''The Age of Innocence'', ''Gangs of New York'', ''Hugo''), he is also known to contribute his voice to a film without appearing on screen (e.g. as in ''The Aviator'' and ''The Wolf of Wall Street''). In ''The Age of Innocence'', for example, he appears in the non-speaking role of a [[large format]] portrait photographer in one of the passing scenes of the film. He provides the opening voice-over narration in ''Mean Streets'' and ''The Color of Money''; plays the off-screen dressing room attendant in the final scene of ''Raging Bull'', and provides the voice of the unseen ambulance dispatcher in ''Bringing Out the Dead''.<ref>[http://www.filmsite.org/directorcameos1.html Most Famous Film Director Cameos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510072224/http://www.filmsite.org/directorcameos1.html |date=May 10, 2008 }} by Tim Dirks, [[Filmsite.org]] (online), 2008</ref> He also appears as the director of fictional newly formed Vatican Television in the Italian comedy ''[[In the Pope's Eye]]''.\n\n===Religious guilt===\nGuilt is a prominent theme in many of his films, as is the role of Catholicism in creating and dealing with guilt (''Who's That Knocking at My Door'', ''Mean Streets'', ''Raging Bull'', ''Bringing Out the Dead'', ''The Departed'', ''Shutter Island'').

(was) a crucial player in both gangland politics and the actual practical politics of the day, and the movie's key through line is the inseparability of those two realms. ''The Irishman'' is a sociopolitical horror story that views much of modern American history as a continuous crime in motion, in which every level of society\u2014from domestic life through local business through big business through national and international politics\u2014is poisoned by graft and bribery, shady deals and dirty money, threats of violence and its gruesome enactment, and the hard-baked impunity that keeps the entire system running.<ref>\"Watching ''The Irishman'' on Netflix Is the Best Way to See It.\" By Richard Brody.

This tribute to Scorsese's home town and the classic Hollywood musical was a box-office failure. The film was the director's third collaboration with Robert De Niro, co-starring with [[Liza Minnelli]]. The film is best remembered today for the title theme song, which was popularized by [[Frank Sinatra]]. Although possessing Scorsese's usual visual panache and stylistic bravura, many critics felt its enclosed studio-bound atmosphere left it leaden in comparison with his earlier work. Despite its weak reception, the film is regarded positively by some critics. Richard Brody in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote: {{quote|For Scorsese, a lifelong cinephile, the essence of New York could be found in its depiction in classic Hollywood movies.

By this stage the director had  developed a serious [[cocaine]] addiction. However, he did find the creative drive to make the highly regarded ''[[The Last Waltz]]'', documenting the final concert by [[The Band]]. It was held at the [[Winterland Ballroom]] in San Francisco on American Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1976, and featured one of the most extensive lineups of prominent guest performers at a single concert, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[Neil Young]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Paul Butterfield]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Ronnie Wood]], and [[Eric Clapton]]. However, Scorsese's commitments to other projects delayed the release of the film until 1978. Another Scorsese-directed documentary, titled ''[[American Boy: A Profile of Steven Prince|American Boy]]'', also appeared in 1978, focusing on Steven Prince, the cocky gun salesman who appeared in ''Taxi Driver''. A period of wild partying followed, damaging the director's already fragile health. Scorsese helped provide footage for the documentary ''[[Elvis on Tour]]''. Before the end of 1979, Scorsese married actress [[Isabella Rossellini]], and they stayed together for four years until their divorce in 1983.<ref>{{cite news |last=Halpern |first=Dan |title=Interview: Isabella Rossellini \u2013 Daddy's girl |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/may/01/features.features11 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |date=April 30, 2006 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418234306/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/may/01/features.features11 |archivedate=April 18, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== 1980s ===\nBy several accounts (Scorsese's included), Robert De Niro practically saved Scorsese's life when he persuaded him to kick his cocaine addiction to make his highly regarded film ''[[Raging Bull]]''.

From this work onwards, Scorsese's films are always labeled as \"A Martin Scorsese Picture\" on promotional material. ''Raging Bull'', filmed in high contrast black and white, is where Scorsese's style reached its zenith: ''Taxi Driver'' and ''New York, New York'' had used elements of [[expressionism]] to replicate psychological points of view, but here the style was taken to new extremes, employing extensive slow-motion, complex tracking shots, and extravagant distortion of perspective (for example, the size of boxing rings would change from fight to fight).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eufs.org.uk/films/raging_bull.html |title=Raging Bull |publisher=Eufs.org.uk |date=March 5, 2001 |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430185450/http://www.eufs.org.uk/films/raging_bull.html |archivedate=April 30, 2009}}</ref> Thematically too, the concerns carried on from ''Mean Streets'' and ''Taxi Driver'': insecure males, violence, guilt, and redemption.\n\nAlthough the screenplay for ''Raging Bull'' was credited to Paul Schrader and [[Mardik Martin]] (who earlier co-wrote ''Mean Streets''), the finished script differed extensively from Schrader's original draft. It was rewritten several times by various writers including [[Jay Cocks]] (who went on to co-script later Scorsese films ''The Age of Innocence'' and ''[[Gangs of New York]]''). The final draft was largely written by Scorsese and Robert De Niro.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ageing bulls return |newspaper=Observer |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,,98151,00.html |date=October 31, 1999 |first=Mark |last=Morris |location=London |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111064454/http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0%2C%2C98151%2C00.html |archivedate=January 11, 2008}}</ref> The [[American Film Institute]] chose ''Raging Bull'' as the number one American sports film on [[AFI's 10 Top 10#Sports|their list of the top 10 sports films]].

In 2007, they ranked ''Raging Bull'' as the fourth greatest film of all time on their [[AFI's 100 Years&nbsp;... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)]] list.\n\nScorsese's next project was his fifth collaboration with Robert De Niro, ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]'' (1983). It is a [[satire]] on the world of media and celebrity, whose central character is a troubled loner who ironically becomes famous through a criminal act ([[kidnapping]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.timeout.com/film/78730.html |title=The King of Comedy Film Review |publisher=Timeout.com |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110220949/http://www.timeout.com/film/78730.html |archivedate=January 10, 2008}}</ref> The film was an obvious departure from the more emotionally committed films he had become associated with.

It still bore many of Scorsese's trademarks, however. The ''King of Comedy'' failed at the box office, but has become increasingly well regarded by critics in the years since its release.

This led to a more significant acting appearance in [[Bertrand Tavernier]]'s [[jazz]] film ''[[Round Midnight (film)|Round Midnight]]''. He also made a brief venture into television, directing an episode of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]''.\n\nWith ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' (1985), Scorsese made an esthetic shift back to a pared-down, almost \"underground\" film-making style. Filmed on an extremely low budget, on location, and at night in the [[SoHo]] neighborhood of Manhattan, the film is a black comedy about one increasingly misfortunate night for a mild New York word processor ([[Griffin Dunne]]) and features cameos by such disparate actors as [[Teri Garr]] and [[Cheech and Chong]]. Along with the 1987 [[Michael Jackson]] music video \"[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)#Music video|Bad]]\", in 1986 Scorsese made ''[[The Color of Money]]'', a sequel to the much admired [[Robert Rossen]] film ''[[The Hustler (film)|The Hustler]]'' (1961) with [[Paul Newman]], which co-starred [[Tom Cruise]]. Although adhering to Scorsese's established style, ''The Color of Money'' was the director's first official foray into [[mainstream]] film-making. The film finally won actor Paul Newman an Oscar and gave Scorsese the clout to finally secure backing for a project that had been a longtime goal for him: ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]''.\n\nIn 1983, Scorsese began work on this long-cherished personal project. ''The Last Temptation of Christ'', based on the [[The Last Temptation of Christ|1951 novel]] written by [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], retold the life of [[Christ]] in human rather than divine terms. [[Barbara Hershey]] recalls introducing Scorsese to the book while they were filming ''Boxcar Bertha''.<ref name=TCM>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=194050 |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |title=Boxcar Bertha |accessdate=November 17, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006002322/http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=194050 |archivedate=October 6, 2010}}</ref> The film was slated to shoot under the [[Paramount Pictures]] banner, but shortly before principal photography was to start, Paramount pulled the plug on the project, citing pressure from religious groups. In this aborted 1983 version, [[Aidan Quinn]] was cast as Jesus, and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] was cast as [[Pontius Pilate]]. (In the 1988 version, these roles were played by [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[David Bowie]] respectively.) However, following his mid-1980s flirtation with commercial Hollywood, Scorsese made a major return to personal filmmaking with the project, which was ultimately released in 1988. Even prior to its release, the film (adapted by ''Taxi Driver'' and ''Raging Bull'' veteran Paul Schrader) caused a massive furor, with worldwide protests against its perceived [[blasphemy]] effectively turning a low-budget independent film into a media sensation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/flashpoints/theater/lasttemptation.html |title=Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ |publisher=[[Pbs.org]] |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830074627/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/flashpoints/theater/lasttemptation.html |archivedate=August 30, 2010}}</ref> Most of the controversy centered on the final passages of the film, which depicted Christ marrying and raising a family with [[Mary Magdalene]] in a [[Satan]]-induced [[hallucination]] while on the cross.\n\nLooking past the controversy, ''The Last Temptation of Christ'' gained critical acclaim and remains an important work in Scorsese's canon: an explicit attempt to wrestle with the spirituality underpinning his films up until that point. The director went on to receive his second nomination for a Best Director Academy Award (again unsuccessfully, this time losing to [[Barry Levinson]] for ''[[Rain Man]]''). Scorsese then married producer [[Barbara De Fina]] in 1985, his fourth of five marriages; their marriage ended in divorce in 1991. As a separate film project, and along with directors [[Woody Allen]] and Francis Ford Coppola in 1989, Scorsese provided one of three segments in the portmanteau film ''[[New York Stories]]'', called \"Life Lessons\".\n\n=== 1990s ===\n[[File:Scorsese 01.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Martin Scorsese in 1995]]\nAfter a decade of films considered by critics to be mostly mixed results, Scorsese's gangster epic ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990) was considered his return to directorial form, and his most confident and fully realized film since ''Raging Bull''. De Niro and [[Joe Pesci]] offered a virtuoso display of Scorsese's bravura cinematic technique in the film and re-established, enhanced, and consolidated his reputation. After the film was released, [[Roger Ebert]], a friend and supporter of Scorsese, named ''Goodfellas'' \"the best mob movie ever\". It is ranked No. 1 on Ebert's movie list for 1990, along with those of [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Peter Travers]]', and is widely considered one of the director's greatest achievements.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19900902/REVIEWS/9020301/1023 |title=:: rogerebert.com :: Reviews :: GoodFellas (xhtml) |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=September 2, 1990 |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730045115/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19900902%2FREVIEWS%2F9020301%2F1023 |archivedate=July 30, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000623089 |title=GoodFellas |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date= |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050206091630/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000623089 |archivedate=February 6, 2005 |first=Stephen |last=Dalton |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/goodf.html |title=GoodFellas (1990) |publisher=Filmsite.org |date= |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110122117/http://www.filmsite.org/goodf.html |archivedate=January 10, 2010}}</ref> The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and Scorsese earned his third Best Director nomination but again lost to a first-time director, [[Kevin Costner]] (''[[Dances with Wolves]]''). Joe Pesci earned the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance. Scorsese and the film also won a number of other awards, including five [[BAFTA]] Awards, a [[Silver Lion]] and more. The American Film Institute placed ''Goodfellas'' at No. 94 on the AFI's 100 Years&nbsp;... 100 Movies list. On the 2007 updated version, they moved ''Goodfellas'' up to No. 92 on the AFI's 100 Years&nbsp;... 100 Movies list (10th Anniversary Edition) and put ''Goodfellas'' at No. 2 on [[AFI's 10 Top 10#Gangster|their list of the top 10 gangster films]] (after ''[[The Godfather]]'').\n\nIn 1990, he released his only short-form documentary: ''[[Made in Milan]]'' about fashion designer [[Giorgio Armani]]. The following year brought ''[[Cape Fear (1991 film)|Cape Fear]]'', a remake of a cult [[Cape Fear (1962 film)|1962 movie]] of the same name and the director's seventh collaboration with De Niro. Another foray into the mainstream, the film was a stylized thriller taking its cues heavily from [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Charles Laughton]]'s ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'' (1955). ''Cape Fear'' received a mixed critical reception and was lambasted in many quarters for its scenes depicting [[misogynistic]] violence. However, the lurid subject matter gave Scorsese a chance to experiment with visual tricks and effects. The film garnered two Oscar nominations. Earning $80 million domestically, it stood as Scorsese's most commercially successful release until ''The Aviator'' (2004), and then ''The Departed'' (2006). The film also marked the first time Scorsese used wide-screen Panavision with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1. Throughout the early 1990s until 1997, Scorsese actively dated actress [[Illeana Douglas]] following his third divorce.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://people.com/archive/note-worthy-vol-51-no-8/ |title=Note Worthy|first= Dan|last= Jewel|date= March 1, 1999|work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |access-date=October 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181025225552/https://people.com/archive/note-worthy-vol-51-no-8/ |archive-date=October 25, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Scorsese acted in a small role as [[Vincent van Gogh]] in the film ''[[Dreams (1990 film)|Dreams]]'' by Japanese director [[Akira Kurosawa]]. Scorsese's 1994 cameo appearance in the Robert Redford film ''Quiz Show'' is remembered for the telling line: \"You see, the audience didn't tune in to watch some amazing display of intellectual ability.

He produced a wide range of films, including major Hollywood studio productions (''[[Mad Dog and Glory]]'', ''[[Clockers (film)|Clockers]]''), low-budget independent films (''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]'', ''[[Naked in New York]]'', ''[[Grace of My Heart]]'', ''[[Search and Destroy]]'', ''[[The Hi-Lo Country]]''), and even the foreign film (''[[Con gli occhi chiusi]]'' (With Closed Eyes)).\n\n[[File:Martin Scorsese 03.jpg|thumb|left|Scorsese in 1995]]\n\n''The Age of Innocence'' (1993) was a significant departure for Scorsese, a period adaptation of the [[Edith Wharton]] [[The Age of Innocence|novel]] about the constrictive high society of late-19th century New York. It was highly lauded by critics upon its original release but was a [[box office bomb]], making an overall loss. As noted in ''Scorsese on Scorsese'' by editor\u2013interviewer Ian Christie, the news that Scorsese wanted to make a film about a failed 19th-century romance raised many eyebrows among the film fraternity; all the more when Scorsese made it clear that it was a personal project and not a studio for-hire job.\n\nScorsese was interested in doing a \"romantic piece\", and he was strongly drawn to the characters and the story of Wharton's text. Scorsese wanted his film to be as rich an emotional experience as the book was to him rather than the traditional academic adaptations of literary works. To this end, Scorsese sought influence from diverse period films that had had an emotional impact on him. In ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', he documents influences from films such as [[Luchino Visconti]]'s ''[[Senso (film)|Senso]]'' and his ''[[The Leopard (1963 film)|Il Gattopardo]]'' (The Leopard) as well as [[Orson Welles]]'s ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' and also Roberto Rossellini's ''[[La prise de pouvoir par Louis&nbsp;XIV]]'' (The Taking of Power by Louis&nbsp;XIV). Although ''The Age of Innocence'' was ultimately different from these films in terms of narrative, story, and thematic concern, the presence of a lost society, of lost values as well as detailed re-creations of social customs and rituals continues the tradition of these films. It came back into the public eye, especially in countries such as the UK and France, but still is largely neglected in North America. The film earned five Academy Award nominations (including  Best Adapted Screenplay for Scorsese), winning the Costume Design Oscar. This was his first collaboration with the Academy Award-winning actor [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], with whom he would work again on ''Gangs of New York''.\n\n''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]'' (1995), like ''The Age of Innocence'' before it, focused on a tightly wound male whose well-ordered life is disrupted by the arrival of unpredictable forces. The fact that it was a violent gangster film made it more palatable to the director's fans who perhaps were baffled by the apparent departure of the earlier film. ''Casino'' was a box office success,<ref name=\"variety-gross\">{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/andrew-garfield-to-star-in-martin-scorseses-silence-exclusive-1200470625/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Scott |last=Foundas |title=Andrew Garfield to Star in Martin Scorsese's 'Silence' (EXCLUSIVE) |date=May 7, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430081104/http://variety.com/2013/film/news/andrew-garfield-to-star-in-martin-scorseses-silence-exclusive-1200470625/ |archivedate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> but the film received mixed-to-positive notices from critics. In large part this was due to its significant stylistic similarities to his earlier ''Goodfellas'', and its excessive violence, which garnered it a reputation as possibly the most violent American gangster film. Indeed, many of the tropes and tricks of the earlier film resurfaced more or less intact, most obviously the casting of both Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, with Pesci once again playing an unbridled psychopath. [[Sharon Stone]] was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress Academy Award]] for her performance. During the filming, Scorsese played a background part as a gambler at one of the tables.\n\nScorsese still found time for a four-hour documentary in 1995, titled ''[[A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies]]'', offering a thorough trek through American cinema. It covered the silent era to 1969, a year after which Scorsese began his feature career. He said, \"I wouldn't feel right commenting on myself or my contemporaries.\" In the four-hour documentary, Scorsese lists the four aspects of the director he believes are the most important as (1) the director as storyteller; (2) the director as an illusionist: D. W. Griffith or F. W. Murnau, who created new editing techniques among other innovations that made the appearance of sound and color possible later on; (3) the director as a smuggler\u2014filmmakers such as [[Douglas Sirk]], Samuel Fuller, and [[Vincente Minnelli]], who used to hide subversive messages in their films; and (4) the director as iconoclast. In the preface to this documentary, Scorsese states his commitment to the \"Director's Dilemma\", in which a successful contemporary director must be pragmatic about the realities of getting financing for films of personal esthetic interest by accepting the need of \"making one film for the studio, and (then) making one for oneself.\"\n\nIf ''The Age of Innocence'' alienated and confused some fans, then ''[[Kundun]]'' (1997) went several steps further, offering an account of the early life of [[Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama]], the [[People's Liberation Army]]'s entry into [[Tibet]], and the Dalai Lama's subsequent exile to India. Not only a departure in subject matter, ''Kundun'' saw Scorsese employing a fresh narrative and visual approach. Traditional dramatic devices were substituted for a trance-like meditation achieved through an elaborate [[tableau vivant|tableau]] of colorful visual images.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.timeout.com/film/78857.html |title=Kundun |magazine=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110232624/http://www.timeout.com/film/78857.html |archivedate=January 10, 2008}}</ref> The film was a source of turmoil for its distributor, [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]], which was planning significant expansion into the Chinese market at the time. Initially defiant in the face of pressure from Chinese officials, Disney has since distanced itself from the project, hurting ''Kundun''{{'}}s commercial profile. In the short term, the sheer eclecticism in evidence enhanced the director's reputation. In the long term, however, it appears ''Kundun'' has been sidelined in most critical appraisals of the director, mostly noted as a stylistic and thematic detour. ''Kundun'' was the Scorsese's second attempt to profile the life of a great religious leader, following ''The Last Temptation of Christ''.\n\n''Bringing Out the Dead'' (1999) was a return to familiar territory, with the director and writer Paul Schrader constructing a pitch-black comic take on their own earlier ''Taxi Driver''.<ref>{{cite web |title=New York Stories: A Complete Ranking of Martin Scorsese's Films Read More: Ranking Martin Scorsese's Movies From Best to Worst |url=https://screencrush.com/scorsese-list/ |publisher=[[Screen Crush]] |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428142744/http://screencrush.com/scorsese-list/ |archivedate=April 28, 2014}}</ref> Like previous Scorsese-Schrader collaborations, its final scenes of spiritual redemption explicitly recalls the films of Robert Bresson.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol4-2000/n12reinert |title=Reinert on Bringing Out the Dead |publisher=Film-philosophy.com |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174544/http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol4-2000/n12reinert |archivedate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> (It is also worth noting that the film's incident-filled nocturnal setting is reminiscent of ''After Hours''.)

In 1998, at the [[70th Academy Awards]], Scorsese presented the award to film legend [[Stanley Donen]].

The documentary foreshadowed the director's next project, the epic ''Gangs of New York'' (2002), influenced by (amongst many others) major Italian directors such as Luchino Visconti and filmed in its entirety at Rome's famous [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] film studios. With a production budget said to be in excess of $100 million, ''Gangs of New York'' was Scorsese's biggest and arguably most mainstream venture to date. Like ''The Age of Innocence'', it was set in 19th-century New York, although focusing on the other end of the social scale (and like that film, also starring Daniel Day-Lewis). The film marked the first collaboration between Scorsese and actor [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], who became a fixture in later Scorsese films.

Seven film-makers including Wim Wenders, [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Mike Figgis]], and Scorsese himself each contributed a 90-minute film (Scorsese's entry was titled ''Feel Like Going Home'').

Their belief that it would prove a lucrative investment was proven right. The theatre was successful beyond wildest expectations. The Corinthian-style temple of amusement, which had cost a quarter of a million dollars,  opened on January 18, 1869 with a performance of [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Bulwer-Lytton]]'s play ''Money''. <ref> Rather, Bonanza Theater, 29.</ref> <ref name=wilmeth>Don B. Wilmeth (2007) ''The Cambridge Guide to American Theatre'', Cambridge University Press; 2 edition {{ISBN|0521835380}}</ref> it was the leading theater in the city until its demolition in 1888. There were elaborate murals of San Francisco painted by local artist [[Gideon Jacques Denny|G.J. Denny]] and a panoramic view of San Francisco Bay entitled \"Entrance to the Golden Gate,\" on the drop curtain. The theater claimed to be the first on the West Coast to use calcium light ([[limelight]]) with parabolic reflectors, aimed from the house, to light up the stage.<ref name=smith/>\n\nOn the first anniversary of the theater's opening, a Scandinavian bandleader had the following to say,\n\n<blockquote>The first year [1869-1870] the California Theatre cleared $100,000. On the evening of our first anniversary, Mr. Barrett stood at the stage door and invited every single individual belonging to the theatre, saying that after the performance we should all meet up in Pacific Hall on the second floor of the California Theatre building, facing Bush street. Upon coming into the hall we were surprised with a large banquet table set in the form of \u201cT\u201d and furnished from the best caterer, Maison-Doree, at $5 a piece.<ref>''Musical and Theatrical New, San Francisco'' (1922) \"The Journal of August Wetterman\", California State Library, Sacramento</ref></blockquote>\n\n\nButtressed by good financial prospects due to a mini-boom in mining in Nevada, the California Theater enjoyed a blockbuster premiere season. With [[Annette Ince]] as leading lady, and a fine supporting cast largely recruited from rival manager [[Thomas Maguire (impresario)|Thomas Maguire]], the California hosted plays ranging from Shakespeare through melodrama and comedy. <ref> Carolyn Grattan Eichin, ''From San Francisco Eastward; Victorian Theater in the American West'', (University of Nevada Press, 2020), 116,135,245n112</ref> Comedian [[John E. Owens]] became the first nationally known star to perform at the California on tour, followed by East Coast sensation [[Charlotte Thompson (actress)|Charlotte Thompson]].<ref> Eichin, ''From San Francisco Eastward'', 116, 179,126</ref>. At the end of the first season, the large cast and crew of the California traveled to [[Virginia City, Nevada]] to perform for over a month at [[Piper's Opera House]] in popular shows including ''Sea of Ice''. <ref> Eichin, From San Francisco Eastward, 126-127</ref>. By January 3, 1870 the theater had offered its 300th performance with McCullough and Barrett in an intense rivalry highlighted by the fact that McCullough had appeared in twenty-seven leading roles to Barrett's ten. <ref> Rather, ''Bonanza Theater'', 51-52, 56 </ref> By mid-1870 Barrett took a leave of absence and returned to New York City, eventually selling his financial interest to John McCullough. Barrett returned to the California Theatre as a star, not a manager, in 1872 as part of a western tour. <ref> Rather, ''Bonanza Theater'', 59</ref>, Eichin, ''From San Francisco Eastward'', 106-108, 128.</ref>\n\nThe theater enjoyed exceptional years in the mid-1870s due to good economic times following the discovery of the discrete big bonanza ore chamber on the Comstock Lode. Coupled with recession on the East Coast, many recognized actors and actresses trekked west to play the California. The cavalcade of stars included [[Dion Boucicault]] in his own creations, [[Lotta Crabtree]], [[William J.

It is perfectly fire-proof, and has 19 exits. The main entrance, on Bush street, is formed by a Roman arch of massive proportions and striking design. The vestibule is rectangular in shape, is finished in antique oak panelling, with pilasters and arabesques, and is lighted by thirty-two 16 candle-power lamps and an electrolier of eight 82's. In the beautiful foyer is another large electrolier.\n<br/><br/>\nIn the auditorium, behind the eight proscenium boxes, with dome-shaped canopies supported by columns, rise arches of Indian fretwork carrying pillars surmounted by 88 candle-power lamps enclosed in opalescent globes shaped like pineapples. The ceiling consists of three concave divisions extending from wall to wall parallel with the front of the stage, gradually rising upward, and separated by narrow panels or chords. It is crossed by four bands of dark color, in which, as well as in the chords and fantastic tracery of the decorations, are set numbers of lamps. From the ceiling, over the parquet and near the boxes, depend three rich electroliers similar in design to those throughout the house, formed by a centre fixture of opalescent glass held in cast metal work, with four pendants of the same shape hanging by chains attached to arms radiating from the stem of the fixture. All the electroliers were specially designed by J. M. Wood, of Chicago, the architect.\n<br/><br/>\nThroughout the house the decorations are so designed that lamps in the midst of bands of flowers, dados and carvings, not only afford light, but add hitherto unknown features to the general ornamentation. At the back of the metal and plastic tracery of the boxes, balcony and gallery, panels of cathedral glass are inserted, which soften the radiance of 16 candle-power lamps set behind, and give to the railings the effect of carvings thrown into relief by mellow light. For producing winter and moonlight effects, and as a substitute for calcium light, six movable bunch lights, with silvered reflectors, are provided.\n<br/><br/>\nThe rheostats, which control all the lamps in the house, are of novel design.

The handles of the switches can be locked to a shaft which runs through all; by tightening the handles of the switches to the shaft every part of the house can be dimmed at once, and by loosening any number, any portions can be regulated at the will of the switch-man. Being equally divided, one-half the lamps in the auditorium can gradually be turned down while the other half is being lighted, producing a fine blending effect.

On the evening of our first anniversary, Mr. Barrett stood at the stage door and invited every single individual belonging to the theatre, saying that after the performance we should all meet up in Pacific Hall on the second floor of the California Theatre building, facing Bush street.

His father's family had emigrated from [[Holland]], settling in  [[Pennsylvania]] and then [[Kentucky]], until finally moving to Ohio. Applegate was educated within the [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s at Georgetown, where he later studied and practiced [[law]]. During the [[American Civil War]], Applegate enlisted for one year on July 9, 1861, as a [[wagon]]er in the Fourth Independent Company, Ohio Cavalry, but soon became its [[quartermaster sergeant]]. In April 1865, he was commissioned [[Captain (United States)|captain]] of Company H, [[189th Ohio Infantry]]. Too late to see action, his regiment was sent to Alabama to serve on occupation duty.\n\nAfter his discharge, Applegate returned home for his family and moved to [[Huntsville, Alabama]], to open his law practice. In 1867, he was elected as a Radical Republican to serve as a member of the Constitutional Convention to frame a new State [[constitution]]. In the election under that constitution, Applegate was Alabama's first and only elected lieutenant governor on August 13, 1868. He moved to Mobile and served Alabama two years as lieutenant governor. He died of mysterious causes in Chattanooga two years later.\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.archives.state.al.us/conoff/Applegat.html Biography courtesy of the Alabama Department of Archives]\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{S-off|us}}\n{{Succession box\n| before= ''Title established''\n|title= [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]]\n|years=1868\u20131870 \n|after=[[Edward H.

The others are [[Chios]], [[Ikaria]], [[Lemnos]], and [[Samos]].  The North Aegean region governs nine inhabited islands: Lesbos, [[Chios]], [[Psara]], [[Oinousses]], [[Ikaria]], [[Fournoi Korseon]], [[Lemnos]], [[Agios Efstratios]] and [[Samos]].  The capital of the [[North Aegean]] Region is [[Mytilene]]. The population of Lesbos, which sometimes is called ''the Island of the Poets'',<ref>[https://www.news.gr/travel/article/1207397/lesvos.html%3famp \u039b\u03ad\u03c3\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf \u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03af \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b7\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd]</ref> is approximately 86,000, a third of whom live in its capital, Mytilene, in the southeastern part of the island. The remaining population is distributed in small towns and villages. The largest are [[Plomari]], [[Kalloni]], the [[Gera Villages]], [[Agiassos]], [[Eresos]], and [[Molyvos]] (the ancient Mythimna).\n\nAccording to later Greek writers, Mytilene was founded in the 11th century BC by the family Penthilidae, who arrived from [[Thessaly]] and ruled the city-state until a popular revolt (590\u2013580&nbsp;BC) led by [[Pittacus of Mytilene]] ended their rule.  In fact the archaeological and linguistic record may indicate a late [[Iron Age]] arrival of Greek settlers although references in Late Bronze Age Hittite archives indicate a likely Greek presence then. The name Mytilene itself seems to be of [[Hittite language|Hittite]] origin. According to [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', Lesbos was part of the kingdom of [[Priam]], which was based in [[Anatolia]] (the peninsula portion of the Asian part of present-day [[Turkey]]).  Much work remains to be done to determine just what happened and when.   In the Middle Ages, it was under [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and then [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] rule. Lesbos was [[Siege of Mytilene (1462)|conquered]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1462. The Ottomans then ruled the island until the [[First Balkan War]] in 1912, when it became part of the Kingdom of Greece.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name is from {{lang-grc|\u039b\u03ad\u03c3\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2}} ''L\u00e9sbos'' \"forested\" or \"woody\", possibly a [[Hittite language|Hittite]] borrowing, as the original Hittite name for the island was ''Lazpa''.

Eleven million [[olive tree]]s cover 40% of the island together with other [[fruit tree]]s. Forests of mediterranean [[pine]]s, chestnut trees and some [[oak]]s occupy 20%, and the remainder is [[scrubland|scrub]], [[grassland]] or urban.\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe island has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa'' in the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]). The mean annual temperature is {{convert|18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}, and the mean annual rainfall is {{convert|750|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}. Its exceptional [[sunlight|sunshine]] makes it one of the sunniest islands in the Aegean Sea.

Lesbos contains one of the few known [[petrified wood|petrified forests]], called [[Petrified forest of Lesbos]], and it has been declared a [[Protected Natural Monument]]. Fossilised plants have been found in many localities on the western part of the island. The fossilised forest was formed during the Late [[Oligocene]] to Lower\u2013Middle [[Miocene]], as determined by the intense [[volcanic activity]] in the area. Neogene [[volcanic rock]]s dominate the central and western part of the island, comprising [[andesite]]s, [[dacite]]s and [[rhyolite]]s, [[ignimbrite]], [[pyroclastic]]s, [[tuff]]s, and [[volcanic ash]]. The products of the volcanic activity covered the [[vegetation]] of the area and the [[fossil]]ization process took place during favourable conditions.

[[Macareus of Rhodes]] was reputedly  the first king whose many daughters bequeathed their names to some of the present larger towns. In Classical myth his sister, [[Canace]], was killed to have him made king. The place names with female origins are claimed by some{{who|date=December 2019}} to be much earlier settlements named after local goddesses, who were replaced by gods; however, there is little evidence to support this. [[Homer]] refers to the island as \"''Macaros edos''\", the seat of Macar. [[Hittites|Hittite]] records from the [[Bronze Age|Late Bronze Age]] name the island ''Lazpa'' and must have considered its population significant enough to allow the Hittites to \"borrow their gods\" (presumably idols) to cure  their king when the local gods were not forthcoming. It is believed that emigrants from mainland Greece, mainly from  [[Thessaly]], entered the island in the [[Late Bronze Age]] and bequeathed it with the Aeolic dialect of the Greek language, whose written form survives in the poems of [[Sappho]], amongst others.\n\n[[File:LESBOS, Unattributed Koinon mint. Circa 510-480 BC.jpg|thumb|Coin of Lesbos, Ionia, under the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. Circa 510\u2013480 BC.]]\n\nThe abundant grey pottery ware found on the island and the worship of [[Cybele]], the great mother-goddess of [[Anatolia]], suggest the cultural continuity of the population from [[Neolithic]] times. When the Persian king [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] defeated [[Croesus]] (546 BC) the Ionic Greek cities of Anatolia and the adjacent islands became Persian subjects and remained such until the Persians were defeated by the Greeks at the [[Battle of Salamis]] (480 BC). The island was governed by an [[oligarchy]] in [[Archaic Greece|archaic times]], followed by quasi-democracy in [[Classical Greece|classical times]]. For a short period it was a member of the [[Delian League|Athenian confederacy]], its apostasy from which is recounted by [[Thucydides]] in the ''[[Mytilenian Debate]]'', in Book III of his ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''. In [[Hellenistic]] times, the island belonged to various [[Diadochi|Successor kingdoms]] until 79 BC when it passed into [[Roman Republic|Roman]] hands.\n\n[[File:Metileme by Giacomo Franco.jpg|left|thumb|Map of Lesbos by Giacomo Franco (1597)]]\n\nDuring the Middle Ages it belonged to the [[Byzantine Empire]].

The largest habitation is found in Lisvori (2800\u20131900 BC) part of which is submerged in shallow coastal waters. There are also several archaic, classical Greek and Roman remains. Vitruvius called the ancient city of Mytilene \"magnificent and of good taste\". Remnants of its medieval history are three impressive castles.\n\nLesbos is the birthplace of several famous people. In archaic times, [[Arion]] developed the type of poem called [[dithyramb]], the progenitor of tragedy, and [[Terpander]] invented the seven note musical scale for the lyre. Two of the [[nine lyric poets]] in the Ancient Greek canon, [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] and [[Sappho]], were from Lesbos. [[Phanias of Eresus|Phanias]] wrote history. The seminal artistic creativity of those times brings to mind the myth of [[Orpheus]] to whom [[Apollo]] gave a [[lyre]] and the [[Muse]]s taught to play and sing. When Orpheus incurred the wrath of the god Dionysus he was dismembered by the Maenads and of his body parts his head and his lyre found their way to Lesbos where they have \"remained\" ever since. [[Pittacus]] was one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]. In classical times [[Hellanicus of Lesbos|Hellanicus]] advanced historiography, [[Theophrastus]], the father of botany, succeeded [[Aristotle]] as the head of the Lyceum. Aristotle and [[Epicurus]] lived there for some time, and it is there that Aristotle began systematic zoological investigations.<ref>Harissis, H. 2017.

The others are [[Chios]], [[Ikaria]], [[Lemnos]], and [[Samos]].  The North Aegean region governs nine inhabited islands: Lesbos, [[Chios]], [[Psara]], [[Oinousses]], [[Ikaria]], [[Fournoi Korseon]], [[Lemnos]], [[Agios Efstratios]] and [[Samos]].  The capital of the [[North Aegean]] Region is [[Mytilene]].

The remaining population is distributed in small towns and villages. The largest are [[Plomari]], [[Kalloni]], the [[Gera Villages]], [[Agiassos]], [[Eresos]], and [[Molyvos]] (the ancient Mythimna).\n\nAccording to later Greek writers, Mytilene was founded in the 11th century BC by the family Penthilidae, who arrived from [[Thessaly]] and ruled the city-state until a popular revolt (590\u2013580&nbsp;BC) led by [[Pittacus of Mytilene]] ended their rule.  In fact the archaeological and linguistic record may indicate a late [[Iron Age]] arrival of Greek settlers although references in Late Bronze Age Hittite archives indicate a likely Greek presence then. The name Mytilene itself seems to be of [[Hittite language|Hittite]] origin. According to [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', Lesbos was part of the kingdom of [[Priam]], which was based in [[Anatolia]] (the peninsula portion of the Asian part of present-day [[Turkey]]).  Much work remains to be done to determine just what happened and when.   In the Middle Ages, it was under [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and then [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] rule. Lesbos was [[Siege of Mytilene (1462)|conquered]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1462. The Ottomans then ruled the island until the [[First Balkan War]] in 1912, when it became part of the Kingdom of Greece.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name is from {{lang-grc|\u039b\u03ad\u03c3\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2}} ''L\u00e9sbos'' \"forested\" or \"woody\", possibly a [[Hittite language|Hittite]] borrowing, as the original Hittite name for the island was ''Lazpa''. An older name for the island that was maintained in [[Aeolic Greek]] was {{lang|grc|\u1f3c\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1}} ''\u00cdssa''.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Lesbos topo.png|thumb|left|Topography of Lesbos]]\n[[File:Olympos lesbos.jpg|thumb|Mt.

Lesbos contains one of the few known [[petrified wood|petrified forests]], called [[Petrified forest of Lesbos]], and it has been declared a [[Protected Natural Monument]]. Fossilised plants have been found in many localities on the western part of the island. The fossilised forest was formed during the Late [[Oligocene]] to Lower\u2013Middle [[Miocene]], as determined by the intense [[volcanic activity]] in the area. Neogene [[volcanic rock]]s dominate the central and western part of the island, comprising [[andesite]]s, [[dacite]]s and [[rhyolite]]s, [[ignimbrite]], [[pyroclastic]]s, [[tuff]]s, and [[volcanic ash]]. The products of the volcanic activity covered the [[vegetation]] of the area and the [[fossil]]ization process took place during favourable conditions. The fossilized plants are silicified remnants of a [[sub-tropical]] forest that existed on the northwest part of the island 20\u201315 million years ago.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, RA, OM - Sappho and Alcaeus - Walters 37159.jpg|left|thumb|[[Sappho]] listens as the poet [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] plays a [[kithara]].

[[Macareus of Rhodes]] was reputedly  the first king whose many daughters bequeathed their names to some of the present larger towns. In Classical myth his sister, [[Canace]], was killed to have him made king. The place names with female origins are claimed by some{{who|date=December 2019}} to be much earlier settlements named after local goddesses, who were replaced by gods; however, there is little evidence to support this. [[Homer]] refers to the island as \"''Macaros edos''\", the seat of Macar. [[Hittites|Hittite]] records from the [[Bronze Age|Late Bronze Age]] name the island ''Lazpa'' and must have considered its population significant enough to allow the Hittites to \"borrow their gods\" (presumably idols) to cure  their king when the local gods were not forthcoming. It is believed that emigrants from mainland Greece, mainly from  [[Thessaly]], entered the island in the [[Late Bronze Age]] and bequeathed it with the Aeolic dialect of the Greek language, whose written form survives in the poems of [[Sappho]], amongst others.\n\n[[File:LESBOS, Unattributed Koinon mint. Circa 510-480 BC.jpg|thumb|Coin of Lesbos, Ionia, under the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. Circa 510\u2013480 BC.]]\n\nThe abundant grey pottery ware found on the island and the worship of [[Cybele]], the great mother-goddess of [[Anatolia]], suggest the cultural continuity of the population from [[Neolithic]] times. When the Persian king [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] defeated [[Croesus]] (546 BC) the Ionic Greek cities of Anatolia and the adjacent islands became Persian subjects and remained such until the Persians were defeated by the Greeks at the [[Battle of Salamis]] (480 BC). The island was governed by an [[oligarchy]] in [[Archaic Greece|archaic times]], followed by quasi-democracy in [[Classical Greece|classical times]]. For a short period it was a member of the [[Delian League|Athenian confederacy]], its apostasy from which is recounted by [[Thucydides]] in the ''[[Mytilenian Debate]]'', in Book III of his ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''. In [[Hellenistic]] times, the island belonged to various [[Diadochi|Successor kingdoms]] until 79 BC when it passed into [[Roman Republic|Roman]] hands.\n\n[[File:Metileme by Giacomo Franco.jpg|left|thumb|Map of Lesbos by Giacomo Franco (1597)]]\n\nDuring the Middle Ages it belonged to the [[Byzantine Empire]].

The largest habitation is found in Lisvori (2800\u20131900 BC) part of which is submerged in shallow coastal waters. There are also several archaic, classical Greek and Roman remains. Vitruvius called the ancient city of Mytilene \"magnificent and of good taste\". Remnants of its medieval history are three impressive castles.\n\nLesbos is the birthplace of several famous people. In archaic times, [[Arion]] developed the type of poem called [[dithyramb]], the progenitor of tragedy, and [[Terpander]] invented the seven note musical scale for the lyre. Two of the [[nine lyric poets]] in the Ancient Greek canon, [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] and [[Sappho]], were from Lesbos. [[Phanias of Eresus|Phanias]] wrote history. The seminal artistic creativity of those times brings to mind the myth of [[Orpheus]] to whom [[Apollo]] gave a [[lyre]] and the [[Muse]]s taught to play and sing. When Orpheus incurred the wrath of the god Dionysus he was dismembered by the Maenads and of his body parts his head and his lyre found their way to Lesbos where they have \"remained\" ever since. [[Pittacus]] was one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]. In classical times [[Hellanicus of Lesbos|Hellanicus]] advanced historiography, [[Theophrastus]], the father of botany, succeeded [[Aristotle]] as the head of the Lyceum. Aristotle and [[Epicurus]] lived there for some time, and it is there that Aristotle began systematic zoological investigations.<ref>Harissis, H. 2017.
