The movie is best remembered today for starring a young [[Charlton Heston]] as [[Mark Antony]].\n\nHe graduated from NU on August 26, 1949, then moved to the [[University of California]] at Los Angeles to get his master's degree in radio. In 1950, he was appearing in a college production of ''[[All My Sons]]'' (in the role of Chris) and was spotted by talent scouts from 20th Century Fox and Paramount. Paramount tested him - doing two scenes from ''All My Sons'' with [[Ed Begley]]. They were impressed and offered him an option; [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] of Fox heard about this and offered him a long term contract. The young actor agreed and the studio changed his name to \"Jeffrey Hunter\" on 1 June 1950.<ref name=\"bio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jeffreyhunter.net/NewSite/InPrint/1952/bio.pdf|title=Jeff Hunter Studio bio prepared by 20th Century Fox|date=1952|website=Jeff Hunter fansite}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===20th Century Fox===\nFox started off Hunter in a small role in ''[[Fourteen Hours]]'' (1951), shot in New York for director [[Henry Hathaway]]; he and [[Debra Paget]] were two young people who connect while watching a man about to jump off a ledge. He had a two-minute scene in ''[[Call Me Mister (film)|Call Me Mister]]'' (1951), then was given a bigger part in the all-male war movie ''[[The Frogmen]]'' (1951) for director [[Lewis Milestone]], supporting [[Richard Widmark]] and [[Dana Andrews]]; among his fellow support players was [[Robert Wagner]], another young male under contract to Fox at the time&nbsp;\u2014 the two actors would appear in several movies together and were often rivals for the same part. Hunter was then a \"campus Casanova\" in a ''[[Jeanne Crain]]'' drama, ''[[Take Care of My Little Girl]]'' (1952), directed by [[Jean Negulesco]].<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Modern Screen|date=June 1952|title=Jeffrey Hunter|url=http://www.jeffreyhunter.net/NewSite/InPrint/1952/modernscreen0652.pdf}}</ref>\n\n====Leading man====\nFan response to these appearances was positive and Hunter moved into leading roles with ''[[Red Skies of Montana]]'' (1952), billed third in a film about [[smokejumper]]s with Richard Widmark. He had a more conventional male juvenile lead in ''[[Belles on Their Toes (film)|Belles on Their Toes]]'' (1953), a sequel to ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen]]'', which reunited him with Crain.\n\n[[Marilyn Monroe]] later gave an interview where she discussed Hunter's appeal: \n<blockquote>To me, Jeff is the acme of young American manhood. Why, he looks like he just stepped off a college campus. He's extremely handsome, but this is not what impresses me. He has sort of \u2014 well, an all-encompassing type of magnetism. And he's a walking advertisement for marriage. You can't be with Jeff more than two minutes without realizing that he takes his marriage seriously, and adores his wife and child. He talks about them constantly, and with extreme pride&nbsp;...  You would be certain to guess, even without knowing, that Jeff is the real athletic type. He likes to ski especially, and can you think of anyone who would look better soaring down a mountain?<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.jeffreyhunter.net/NewSite/InPrint/1953/MoviesAug1953.pdf|page=59|title=The Most Exciting Men in Hollywood|magazine=Movies|date=August 1953}}</ref></blockquote> \nFox gave Hunter his first starring role in ''[[Lure of the Wilderness]]'' (1952), a remake of ''[[Swamp Water]]'', directed by Negulesco and opposite Jean Peters. After ''[[Dreamboat (film)|Dreamboat]]'' (1952), where Hunter supported [[Clifton Webb]] and [[Ginger Rogers]], Hunter was given his best role yet: the starring part in a war film, ''[[Sailor of the King]]'' (1953), based on [[C. S. Forester]]'s book, ''[[Brown on Resolution]]''. Although financed by Fox it was essentially a British film, with British talent&nbsp;\u2014 Hunter was cast as a Canadian to explain his accent (his casting led to some difficulties with British film unions).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jeffreyhunter.net/NewSite/InPrint/1953/picturegoer0753.pdf|title=He Made It Single Handed|newspaper=Picturegoer|date=25 July 1953}}</ref>\n\n''Sailor of the King'' was a minor success, as was a Western Hunter made with [[Mitzi Gaynor]], ''[[Three Young Texans]]'' (1954). ''[[Princess of the Nile]]'' (1954) was an \"Eastern\" with [[Debra Paget]] in the title role.  It was not particularly successful either and Hunter did not manage to transition into being a top line star. The title role in ''Prince Valiant'', which had been mentioned for him, was given to Robert Wagner. \"It was a terrible disappointment to me,\" said Hunter later. \"I just didn't know what to do. It seemed my career was over. They were making a lot of pictures on the lot, but I wasn't cast in any of them and I couldn't understand why, particularly since I started out with such a terrific lot of luck.\"<ref name=\"luck\">{{cite magazine |page=45 |url= http://www.jeffreyhunter.net/NewSite/InPrint/1957/movieland0557.pdf |date=1957 |title= Good Guys Sometimes Win: Jeffrey Hunter |magazine= Movieland}}</ref>\n\n====Career lull====\nFox loaned him out, along with Debra Paget, to [[Monogram Pictures|Allied Artists]] to play the abolitionist [[Owen Brown (abolitionist, born 1824)|Owen Brown]] in ''[[Seven Angry Men]]'' (1955), with [[Raymond Massey]] in the lead.\n\nHunter then played an Indian chief in the Western, ''[[White Feather (film)|White Feather]]'' (1955), essentially supporting Wagner. It was a moderate hit at the box office. Hunter says after it, \"I had no immediate pictures scheduled&nbsp;...  Nothing seemed to be coming up. I wasn't thinking of leaving my studio&nbsp;\u2014 it's important having a major studio behind you. It was just that I was restless, and nothing seemed to be happening.\"<ref name=\"photo\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.jeffreyhunter.net/NewSite/InPrint/1956/photoplay0756.pdf|title=He got out from behind the eight ball|magazine=Photoplay|date=July 1956}}</ref>\n\nWith a friend, Bill Hayes, he set up a production company, Hunter Enterprises. They produced a documentary, ''The Living Swamp''. Hunter also began appearing regularly on television, having particular success in an episode of ''[[Climax!]]'' he made with [[Margaret O'Brien]].<ref name=\"luck\"/> Back at Fox he supported [[Anthony Quinn]] in ''[[Seven Cities of Gold (film)|Seven Cities of Gold]]'' (1955).\n\nHe was loaned to [[United Artists]] along with fellow Fox contractees Wagner and [[Joanne Woodward]] for ''[[A Kiss Before Dying (1956 film)|A Kiss Before Dying]]'' (1956). Wagner had the best role&nbsp;\u2014as a killer\u2014while Hunter had the more conventional leading man part. (The movie was shelved for a year before being released.) A loan-out to co-star with John Wayne in the title roles of the now-classic western ''The Searchers'' (1956) began the first of three pictures he made with director John Ford, followed by ''The Last Hurrah'' (1958) and ''Sergeant Rutledge'' (1960).\n\n====''The Searchers''====\n[[File:Jeffrey Hunter The Searchers trailer screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Jeffrey Hunter as Martin Pawley in ''[[The Searchers]]'']]\nHunter's career was revitalised when he successfully lobbied John Ford to cast him as the second lead in ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), supporting John Wayne.\n\nDisney borrowed him to play [[William Allen Fuller]] in the Civil War action movie ''[[The Great Locomotive Chase]]'' (1956), opposite [[Fess Parker]]. Ironically, according to Parker's [[Archive of American Television]] interview, Ford had originally wanted to cast Parker in Hunter's role in ''The Searchers'' but Disney refused to loan him out, something Parker did not hear about until years later; Parker referred to this lost opportunity as his single biggest career setback.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/fess-parker|title=Fess Parker|website=Archive of American Television}}</ref>\n\nThe success of ''The Searchers'' and ''The Great Locomotive Chase'' reignited Fox's interest in Hunter and the studio re-signed him, while giving him the right to make one \"outside\" film a year.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.jeffreyhunter.net/NewSite/InPrint/1956/picturegoer0956.pdf|title=The Rebel with a cause| magazine=Picturegoer|date=29 September 1956}}</ref>\n\nHe supported [[Robert Ryan]] in a Western, ''[[The Proud Ones]]'' (1956). Hunter went over to Universal and supported another older star, [[Fred MacMurray]], in another Western, ''[[Gun for a Coward]]'' (1957), in a role originally meant for [[James Dean]].  Back at Fox, Hunter was reunited with Wagner as the [[James\u2013Younger Gang|James brothers]] in ''[[The True Story of Jesse James]]'' (1957), directed by [[Nicholas Ray]] (Hunter played [[Frank James|Frank]]); it was mildly popular although considered a critical disappointment.\n\nFox gave him a leading role, ''[[The Way to the Gold]]'' (1957), another Western. It was a low-budget production, but proved profitable. He was one of several leads in Fox's look at young people, ''[[No Down Payment]]'' (1957) - not a big hit, but the early work for director [[Martin Ritt]] received some critical acclaim. Fox sent Hunter to Britain to be an American star in a British war film once more: ''[[Count Five and Die]]'' (1957).\n\n====Illness====\nHe was meant to make a movie for Universal, ''If I Should Die'' (later ''[[Appointment with a Shadow]]''), but collapsed on his return from Europe; he was replaced by [[George Nader]].<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Movie Mirror|title=Jeff Hunter: My Wife's Love Saved My Life|url=http://www.jeffreyhunter.net/NewSite/InPrint/1958/MovieMirror_Dec1958.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Films of Jeffrey Hunter|url=http://www.jeffreyhunter.net/NewSite/InPrint/Biographies/Filmograph%20Part%202.pdf}}</ref> He was off the screen for 14 months while ill with what was diagnosed as hepatitis.<ref name=\"louella\"/>\n\nJohn Ford cast him in another film, although it was only a supporting role\u2014''[[The Last Hurrah (1958 film)|The Last Hurrah]]'' (1958), starring [[Spencer Tracy]]. He had a cameo as himself in the [[Pat Boone]] musical at Fox, ''[[Mardi Gras (1958 film)|Mardi Gras]]'' (1958).\n\nHunter then made a war film, ''[[In Love and War (1958 film)|In Love and War]]'' (1958), co-starring with several other Fox contractees such as Wagner. It proved popular.\n\nHunter formed a production company, Mexico Films, and made a film in Mexico, ''[[The Holy City, The Sacred City]]''. It struggled to find a release.\n\nJohn Ford used him for a third (and final) time as the lead in the Western legal drama ''[[Sergeant Rutledge]]'' (1960), although the real star was [[Woody Strode]] and the film was not a big success.\n\nHunter was in an urban thriller, ''[[Key Witness (1960 film)|Key Witness]]'' (1960), directed by [[Phil Karlson]]. After making the film Fox did not renew its contract with Hunter.\n\nHunter's next film was with Karlson; he played [[Guy Gabaldon]] in the Allied Artists film ''[[Hell to Eternity]]'' (1960), which was a hit at the box office. (Gabaldon later named one of his sons Jeffrey Hunter Gabaldon.)\n\n====''King of Kings''====\n[[Image:Kingofkings10.JPG|thumb|right|500px|Jeffrey Hunter as [[Jesus]] in ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'']]\n[[Nicholas Ray]] cast Hunter in the role of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] in the $8 million epic ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'' (1961), produced by [[Samuel Bronston]]. \"I've broken my shackles at last,\" said Hunter at the time.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.jeffreyhunter.net/NewSite/InPrint/1961/BritPhotoplay0961.pdf|title=The Man Who Plays Jesus|page=51|magazine=Photoplay}}</ref> He told [[Louella Parsons]], \"Christ was a carpenter and 33 years old, and I am 33, and I suppose my physical measurements fitted the description in the [[New Testament]].

Hunter's youthful matinee-idol looks resulted in the film being derided as ''I Was a Teenage Jesus'', despite the actor's age at the time. However it was a big hit at the box office and remains one of Hunter's best remembered roles.<ref>Gwilym Beckerlegge, ''From Sacred Text to Internet'', Ashgate, 2001, p.268.</ref> Hunter reflected two years after the film came out that, \"I still get an average of 1,500 letters a month from people who saw me in that film and share the beauty and inspiration I derived from it with me. There are some things that can't be measured in dollars and cents and how can anyone put a price\u2014even the price of a million-dollar career\u2014on the role of the greatest Being this mortal world has ever known?\u201d<ref name=\"king\">{{cite news|url=http://www.jeffreyhunter.net/NewSite/TVPages/TempleHouston/ChicagoTribuneJan1164.pdf|title=Jeff Hunter breaks Hollywood jinx|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=11 January 1964}}</ref>\n\nWhen Hunter returned to Hollywood he deliberately selected parts that were different: a psychopathic killer in an episode of ''[[Checkmate (TV series)|Checkmate]]''; and as the lead in a heist thriller ''[[Man-Trap]]'' (1961), directed by actor [[Edmond O'Brien]].\n\nAt Universal he starred as another real-life figure from World War II, ''[[No Man Is an Island (film)|No Man Is an Island]]'' (1962), the story of [[George Ray Tweed]]. For his old Fox boss [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] he joined an all-star cast in the World War II battle epic ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]''. Hunter provided a climactic heroic moment playing a sergeant who is killed while leading a successful attempt to breach the defense wall atop [[Omaha Beach]] in [[Normandy]].\n\nHe headed to Italy to make ''[[Gold for the Caesars]]'' (1963) with director [[Andre DeToth]]. He was set to co-star with Spencer Tracy and James Stewart in ''The Long Flight'' when he received an offer to appear in a TV show.<ref name=\"king\"/>\n\n====''Temple Houston''====\n[[File:Jeffrey Hunter Temple Houston 1963.JPG|thumb|left|Jeffrey Hunter as ''[[Temple Houston (TV series)|Temple Houston]]'' (1963)]]\nHaving guest-starred on television dramas since the mid-1950s, Hunter was then offered a two-year contract by [[Warner Bros.]] studio boss [[Jack L. Warner|Jack Warner]] that included starring as circuit-riding Texas [[lawyer]] [[Temple Lea Houston]], the youngest son of [[Sam Houston]], in the [[NBC]] series ''[[Temple Houston (TV series)|Temple Houston]]'' (1963\u20131964), which Hunter's production company co-produced. [[Jack Elam]] was his co-star, as gunslinger-turned-marshal George Taggart.<ref name=wtha>Billy Hathorn, \"Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967\", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 89 (2013), pp. 106-109</ref>\n\nHunter described the Temple Houston that he sought to emulate as having \"many sides to his character. He was a flamboyant orator; he was a bit of a dandy; he was tough; he was gentle; he was an excellent marksman,\" all features which gave the series greater latitude with a western format. Houston was also described as follows: He would ride, shoot, fight, drink, and love with the best of them and maybe better than most. The modesty that he displays in day-to-day life would disappear as soon as he enters a courtroom, becoming the flamboyant attorney famous throughout the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]].\"<ref name=wtha/>\n\nThe pilot was released in theaters as the film ''[[Temple Houston (TV series)|The Man from Galveston]]''. ''Temple Houston'' proved illusory for Hunter's long-term career prospects. Hunter thought that the series had found its voice, beginning with the twelfth episode, \"Enough Rope\", by having adopted the light-hearted approach of ABC's former ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' western series, with [[James Garner]].<ref name=Milwaukee>J. D. Spiro. \"Happy in Hollywood\".  ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|The Milwaukee Journal]]''.  July 4, 1965.</ref> As Hunter explained the change in format, the series was \"conceived in humor and delivered in dead seriousness. Then, about halfway through the season, NBC decided to return to the tongue-in-cheek approach. By that time it was too late. The big joke around town was that the series was about a [[synagogue]] in Texas.\"<ref name=wtha/>\n\n[[Ruta Lee]], who guest starred as Lucy Tolliver in \"Enough Rope\", said of Hunter: \"He was one of the prettiest people that ever was put on the screen. God, he was gorgeous.\"<ref name=wtha/> Another Hunter friend, actor [[Van Williams]], a native of [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], who also guest starred in the series, said, \"Things didn't go right for him, and they should have, because if anybody deserved to be a big star, it was Jeffrey Hunter.\"<ref name=wtha/>\n\nIn taking the ''Temple Houston'' role, Hunter was compelled by a scheduling conflict to bow out of John Ford's  final western film, ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]''.<ref name=wtha/>\n\n====''Star Trek''====\nAlthough ''Temple Houston'' did not survive beyond twenty-six weeks, Hunter accepted the lead role of [[Christopher Pike (Star Trek)|Captain Christopher Pike]] in \"[[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Cage]]\", the first [[Television pilot|pilot episode]] of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. [[Clegg Hoyt]], Hunter's co-star in ''[[The True Story of Jesse James]]'', appeared in this pilot as Pitcairn, the transporter chief of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']]. Hunter declined to film a second ''Star Trek'' pilot requested by NBC in 1965, and decided to concentrate on motion pictures. He told the press, \"I was asked to do it, but had I accepted, I would have been tied up much longer than I care to be.

On television, Hunter was known for his 1965 role as Capt. [[Christopher Pike (Star Trek)|Christopher Pike]] in the original [[Television Pilot|pilot episode]] of ''[[Star Trek]]'' and the later use of that footage in \"[[The Menagerie (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Menagerie]]\".\n\n==Early life==\nHunter was born in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, the son of Edith Lois (Burgess) and Henry Herman McKinnies. His family was of [[Irish Catholic]] ancestry.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=hK9iAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA5&lpg=PA5&dq=%22The+McKinnies+family+history+had+its%22&source=bl&ots=ASWwx7NvRQ&sig=y-NKwdp06OSG4eizzd4EL-2W3-k&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjdmPWL7I3VAhVr2IMKHUxyAasQ6AEIFDAA|title=Jeffrey Hunter: The Film, Television, Radio and Stage Performances|first=Paul|last=Green|date=April 29, 2014|publisher=McFarland|via=Google Books}}</ref> After 1930, he was reared in [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin, where he graduated from [[Whitefish Bay High School]]. He was very involved in school sports and began acting in local theater and radio in his early teens. He worked for station WTMJ-FM and the Children's Theatre of the Air, sponsored by the Wauwatosa School Board.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1945 he spent his summers appearing in small roles for a touring summer stock company from New York, the Northport Players. He made his professional radio debut in his senior year in high school on a program called \"Those Whose Serve\", playing a GI.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1945, Hunter joined the United States Navy. He completed a naval radar course at the Radio Technical School and was assigned to Communications Division, Headquarters of the Ninth Naval District, Great Lakes, Illinois. He did not see any battle duty, due to a broken arch-bone suffered in a high school football accident.<ref name=\"bio\" />\n\n===College===\nHunter was discharged from the Navy in May 1946 and went to [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]] in the fall of that year, majoring in speech and radio and minoring in psychology and English.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jeffrey Hunter Died Tuesday From Home Fall|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1665&dat=19690528&id=je0eAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PyQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4189,4450315|newspaper=The Times-News|date=May 28, 1969|page=3}}</ref>\n\nAt college Hunter appeared in two NU stage productions, including [[Ruth Gordon]]'s ''Years Ago'' (as Captain Absolute). He also acted with the NU Theatre summer stock company at Eagles Mere, Pennsylvania in 1947, appearing in ''Too Many Husbands'', ''The Late George Apley'', ''Payment Deferred'', ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', and ''Fata Morgana''. He did radio work with the NU Radio Workshop and Radio Guild, and worked summers with the NBC Radio Institute in Chicago.<ref name=\"bio\" />\n\nHunter's first film role came in 1949. While at Northwestern he was one of a number of students who were cast in [[David Bradley (director)|David Bradley]]'s version of  ''[[Julius Caesar (1950 film)|Julius Caesar]]'' (1950). The movie is best remembered today for starring a young [[Charlton Heston]] as [[Mark Antony]].\n\nHe graduated from NU on August 26, 1949, then moved to the [[University of California]] at Los Angeles to get his master's degree in radio. In 1950, he was appearing in a college production of ''[[All My Sons]]'' (in the role of Chris) and was spotted by talent scouts from 20th Century Fox and Paramount. Paramount tested him - doing two scenes from ''All My Sons'' with [[Ed Begley]]. They were impressed and offered him an option; [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] of Fox heard about this and offered him a long term contract. The young actor agreed and the studio changed his name to \"Jeffrey Hunter\" on 1 June 1950.<ref name=\"bio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jeffreyhunter.net/NewSite/InPrint/1952/bio.pdf|title=Jeff Hunter Studio bio prepared by 20th Century Fox|date=1952|website=Jeff Hunter fansite}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===20th Century Fox===\nFox started off Hunter in a small role in ''[[Fourteen Hours]]'' (1951), shot in New York for director [[Henry Hathaway]]; he and [[Debra Paget]] were two young people who connect while watching a man about to jump off a ledge. He had a two-minute scene in ''[[Call Me Mister (film)|Call Me Mister]]'' (1951), then was given a bigger part in the all-male war movie ''[[The Frogmen]]'' (1951) for director [[Lewis Milestone]], supporting [[Richard Widmark]] and [[Dana Andrews]]; among his fellow support players was [[Robert Wagner]], another young male under contract to Fox at the time&nbsp;\u2014 the two actors would appear in several movies together and were often rivals for the same part. Hunter was then a \"campus Casanova\" in a ''[[Jeanne Crain]]'' drama, ''[[Take Care of My Little Girl]]'' (1952), directed by [[Jean Negulesco]].<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Modern Screen|date=June 1952|title=Jeffrey Hunter|url=http://www.jeffreyhunter.net/NewSite/InPrint/1952/modernscreen0652.pdf}}</ref>\n\n====Leading man====\nFan response to these appearances was positive and Hunter moved into leading roles with ''[[Red Skies of Montana]]'' (1952), billed third in a film about [[smokejumper]]s with Richard Widmark. He had a more conventional male juvenile lead in ''[[Belles on Their Toes (film)|Belles on Their Toes]]'' (1953), a sequel to ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen]]'', which reunited him with Crain.\n\n[[Marilyn Monroe]] later gave an interview where she discussed Hunter's appeal: \n<blockquote>To me, Jeff is the acme of young American manhood. Why, he looks like he just stepped off a college campus. He's extremely handsome, but this is not what impresses me. He has sort of \u2014 well, an all-encompassing type of magnetism. And he's a walking advertisement for marriage. You can't be with Jeff more than two minutes without realizing that he takes his marriage seriously, and adores his wife and child. He talks about them constantly, and with extreme pride&nbsp;...  You would be certain to guess, even without knowing, that Jeff is the real athletic type. He likes to ski especially, and can you think of anyone who would look better soaring down a mountain?<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.jeffreyhunter.net/NewSite/InPrint/1953/MoviesAug1953.pdf|page=59|title=The Most Exciting Men in Hollywood|magazine=Movies|date=August 1953}}</ref></blockquote> \nFox gave Hunter his first starring role in ''[[Lure of the Wilderness]]'' (1952), a remake of ''[[Swamp Water]]'', directed by Negulesco and opposite Jean Peters. After ''[[Dreamboat (film)|Dreamboat]]'' (1952), where Hunter supported [[Clifton Webb]] and [[Ginger Rogers]], Hunter was given his best role yet: the starring part in a war film, ''[[Sailor of the King]]'' (1953), based on [[C. S. Forester]]'s book, ''[[Brown on Resolution]]''. Although financed by Fox it was essentially a British film, with British talent&nbsp;\u2014 Hunter was cast as a Canadian to explain his accent (his casting led to some difficulties with British film unions).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jeffreyhunter.net/NewSite/InPrint/1953/picturegoer0753.pdf|title=He Made It Single Handed|newspaper=Picturegoer|date=25 July 1953}}</ref>\n\n''Sailor of the King'' was a minor success, as was a Western Hunter made with [[Mitzi Gaynor]], ''[[Three Young Texans]]'' (1954). ''[[Princess of the Nile]]'' (1954) was an \"Eastern\" with [[Debra Paget]] in the title role.  It was not particularly successful either and Hunter did not manage to transition into being a top line star. The title role in ''Prince Valiant'', which had been mentioned for him, was given to Robert Wagner. \"It was a terrible disappointment to me,\" said Hunter later. \"I just didn't know what to do. It seemed my career was over. They were making a lot of pictures on the lot, but I wasn't cast in any of them and I couldn't understand why, particularly since I started out with such a terrific lot of luck.\"<ref name=\"luck\">{{cite magazine |page=45 |url= http://www.jeffreyhunter.net/NewSite/InPrint/1957/movieland0557.pdf |date=1957 |title= Good Guys Sometimes Win: Jeffrey Hunter |magazine= Movieland}}</ref>\n\n====Career lull====\nFox loaned him out, along with Debra Paget, to [[Monogram Pictures|Allied Artists]] to play the abolitionist [[Owen Brown (abolitionist, born 1824)|Owen Brown]] in ''[[Seven Angry Men]]'' (1955), with [[Raymond Massey]] in the lead.\n\nHunter then played an Indian chief in the Western, ''[[White Feather (film)|White Feather]]'' (1955), essentially supporting Wagner. It was a moderate hit at the box office. Hunter says after it, \"I had no immediate pictures scheduled&nbsp;...  Nothing seemed to be coming up. I wasn't thinking of leaving my studio&nbsp;\u2014 it's important having a major studio behind you. It was just that I was restless, and nothing seemed to be happening.\"<ref name=\"photo\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.jeffreyhunter.net/NewSite/InPrint/1956/photoplay0756.pdf|title=He got out from behind the eight ball|magazine=Photoplay|date=July 1956}}</ref>\n\nWith a friend, Bill Hayes, he set up a production company, Hunter Enterprises. They produced a documentary, ''The Living Swamp''. Hunter also began appearing regularly on television, having particular success in an episode of ''[[Climax!]]'' he made with [[Margaret O'Brien]].<ref name=\"luck\"/> Back at Fox he supported [[Anthony Quinn]] in ''[[Seven Cities of Gold (film)|Seven Cities of Gold]]'' (1955).\n\nHe was loaned to [[United Artists]] along with fellow Fox contractees Wagner and [[Joanne Woodward]] for ''[[A Kiss Before Dying (1956 film)|A Kiss Before Dying]]'' (1956). Wagner had the best role&nbsp;\u2014as a killer\u2014while Hunter had the more conventional leading man part. (The movie was shelved for a year before being released.) A loan-out to co-star with John Wayne in the title roles of the now-classic western ''The Searchers'' (1956) began the first of three pictures he made with director John Ford, followed by ''The Last Hurrah'' (1958) and ''Sergeant Rutledge'' (1960).\n\n====''The Searchers''====\n[[File:Jeffrey Hunter The Searchers trailer screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Jeffrey Hunter as Martin Pawley in ''[[The Searchers]]'']]\nHunter's career was revitalised when he successfully lobbied John Ford to cast him as the second lead in ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), supporting John Wayne.\n\nDisney borrowed him to play [[William Allen Fuller]] in the Civil War action movie ''[[The Great Locomotive Chase]]'' (1956), opposite [[Fess Parker]]. Ironically, according to Parker's [[Archive of American Television]] interview, Ford had originally wanted to cast Parker in Hunter's role in ''The Searchers'' but Disney refused to loan him out, something Parker did not hear about until years later; Parker referred to this lost opportunity as his single biggest career setback.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/fess-parker|title=Fess Parker|website=Archive of American Television}}</ref>\n\nThe success of ''The Searchers'' and ''The Great Locomotive Chase'' reignited Fox's interest in Hunter and the studio re-signed him, while giving him the right to make one \"outside\" film a year.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.jeffreyhunter.net/NewSite/InPrint/1956/picturegoer0956.pdf|title=The Rebel with a cause| magazine=Picturegoer|date=29 September 1956}}</ref>\n\nHe supported [[Robert Ryan]] in a Western, ''[[The Proud Ones]]'' (1956). Hunter went over to Universal and supported another older star, [[Fred MacMurray]], in another Western, ''[[Gun for a Coward]]'' (1957), in a role originally meant for [[James Dean]].  Back at Fox, Hunter was reunited with Wagner as the [[James\u2013Younger Gang|James brothers]] in ''[[The True Story of Jesse James]]'' (1957), directed by [[Nicholas Ray]] (Hunter played [[Frank James|Frank]]); it was mildly popular although considered a critical disappointment.\n\nFox gave him a leading role, ''[[The Way to the Gold]]'' (1957), another Western. It was a low-budget production, but proved profitable. He was one of several leads in Fox's look at young people, ''[[No Down Payment]]'' (1957) - not a big hit, but the early work for director [[Martin Ritt]] received some critical acclaim. Fox sent Hunter to Britain to be an American star in a British war film once more: ''[[Count Five and Die]]'' (1957).\n\n====Illness====\nHe was meant to make a movie for Universal, ''If I Should Die'' (later ''[[Appointment with a Shadow]]''), but collapsed on his return from Europe; he was replaced by [[George Nader]].<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Movie Mirror|title=Jeff Hunter: My Wife's Love Saved My Life|url=http://www.jeffreyhunter.net/NewSite/InPrint/1958/MovieMirror_Dec1958.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Films of Jeffrey Hunter|url=http://www.jeffreyhunter.net/NewSite/InPrint/Biographies/Filmograph%20Part%202.pdf}}</ref> He was off the screen for 14 months while ill with what was diagnosed as hepatitis.<ref name=\"louella\"/>\n\nJohn Ford cast him in another film, although it was only a supporting role\u2014''[[The Last Hurrah (1958 film)|The Last Hurrah]]'' (1958), starring [[Spencer Tracy]]. He had a cameo as himself in the [[Pat Boone]] musical at Fox, ''[[Mardi Gras (1958 film)|Mardi Gras]]'' (1958).\n\nHunter then made a war film, ''[[In Love and War (1958 film)|In Love and War]]'' (1958), co-starring with several other Fox contractees such as Wagner. It proved popular.\n\nHunter formed a production company, Mexico Films, and made a film in Mexico, ''[[The Holy City, The Sacred City]]''. It struggled to find a release.\n\nJohn Ford used him for a third (and final) time as the lead in the Western legal drama ''[[Sergeant Rutledge]]'' (1960), although the real star was [[Woody Strode]] and the film was not a big success.\n\nHunter was in an urban thriller, ''[[Key Witness (1960 film)|Key Witness]]'' (1960), directed by [[Phil Karlson]]. After making the film Fox did not renew its contract with Hunter.\n\nHunter's next film was with Karlson; he played [[Guy Gabaldon]] in the Allied Artists film ''[[Hell to Eternity]]'' (1960), which was a hit at the box office. (Gabaldon later named one of his sons Jeffrey Hunter Gabaldon.)\n\n====''King of Kings''====\n[[Image:Kingofkings10.JPG|thumb|right|500px|Jeffrey Hunter as [[Jesus]] in ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'']]\n[[Nicholas Ray]] cast Hunter in the role of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] in the $8 million epic ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'' (1961), produced by [[Samuel Bronston]]. \"I've broken my shackles at last,\" said Hunter at the time.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.jeffreyhunter.net/NewSite/InPrint/1961/BritPhotoplay0961.pdf|title=The Man Who Plays Jesus|page=51|magazine=Photoplay}}</ref> He told [[Louella Parsons]], \"Christ was a carpenter and 33 years old, and I am 33, and I suppose my physical measurements fitted the description in the [[New Testament]].

Hunter's youthful matinee-idol looks resulted in the film being derided as ''I Was a Teenage Jesus'', despite the actor's age at the time. However it was a big hit at the box office and remains one of Hunter's best remembered roles.<ref>Gwilym Beckerlegge, ''From Sacred Text to Internet'', Ashgate, 2001, p.268.</ref> Hunter reflected two years after the film came out that, \"I still get an average of 1,500 letters a month from people who saw me in that film and share the beauty and inspiration I derived from it with me. There are some things that can't be measured in dollars and cents and how can anyone put a price\u2014even the price of a million-dollar career\u2014on the role of the greatest Being this mortal world has ever known?\u201d<ref name=\"king\">{{cite news|url=http://www.jeffreyhunter.net/NewSite/TVPages/TempleHouston/ChicagoTribuneJan1164.pdf|title=Jeff Hunter breaks Hollywood jinx|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=11 January 1964}}</ref>\n\nWhen Hunter returned to Hollywood he deliberately selected parts that were different: a psychopathic killer in an episode of ''[[Checkmate (TV series)|Checkmate]]''; and as the lead in a heist thriller ''[[Man-Trap]]'' (1961), directed by actor [[Edmond O'Brien]].\n\nAt Universal he starred as another real-life figure from World War II, ''[[No Man Is an Island (film)|No Man Is an Island]]'' (1962), the story of [[George Ray Tweed]]. For his old Fox boss [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] he joined an all-star cast in the World War II battle epic ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]''. Hunter provided a climactic heroic moment playing a sergeant who is killed while leading a successful attempt to breach the defense wall atop [[Omaha Beach]] in [[Normandy]].\n\nHe headed to Italy to make ''[[Gold for the Caesars]]'' (1963) with director [[Andre DeToth]]. He was set to co-star with Spencer Tracy and James Stewart in ''The Long Flight'' when he received an offer to appear in a TV show.<ref name=\"king\"/>\n\n====''Temple Houston''====\n[[File:Jeffrey Hunter Temple Houston 1963.JPG|thumb|left|Jeffrey Hunter as ''[[Temple Houston (TV series)|Temple Houston]]'' (1963)]]\nHaving guest-starred on television dramas since the mid-1950s, Hunter was then offered a two-year contract by [[Warner Bros.]] studio boss [[Jack L. Warner|Jack Warner]] that included starring as circuit-riding Texas [[lawyer]] [[Temple Lea Houston]], the youngest son of [[Sam Houston]], in the [[NBC]] series ''[[Temple Houston (TV series)|Temple Houston]]'' (1963\u20131964), which Hunter's production company co-produced. [[Jack Elam]] was his co-star, as gunslinger-turned-marshal George Taggart.<ref name=wtha>Billy Hathorn, \"Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967\", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 89 (2013), pp. 106-109</ref>\n\nHunter described the Temple Houston that he sought to emulate as having \"many sides to his character. He was a flamboyant orator; he was a bit of a dandy; he was tough; he was gentle; he was an excellent marksman,\" all features which gave the series greater latitude with a western format. Houston was also described as follows: He would ride, shoot, fight, drink, and love with the best of them and maybe better than most. The modesty that he displays in day-to-day life would disappear as soon as he enters a courtroom, becoming the flamboyant attorney famous throughout the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]].\"<ref name=wtha/>\n\nThe pilot was released in theaters as the film ''[[Temple Houston (TV series)|The Man from Galveston]]''. ''Temple Houston'' proved illusory for Hunter's long-term career prospects. Hunter thought that the series had found its voice, beginning with the twelfth episode, \"Enough Rope\", by having adopted the light-hearted approach of ABC's former ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' western series, with [[James Garner]].<ref name=Milwaukee>J. D. Spiro. \"Happy in Hollywood\".  ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|The Milwaukee Journal]]''.  July 4, 1965.</ref> As Hunter explained the change in format, the series was \"conceived in humor and delivered in dead seriousness. Then, about halfway through the season, NBC decided to return to the tongue-in-cheek approach. By that time it was too late. The big joke around town was that the series was about a [[synagogue]] in Texas.\"<ref name=wtha/>\n\n[[Ruta Lee]], who guest starred as Lucy Tolliver in \"Enough Rope\", said of Hunter: \"He was one of the prettiest people that ever was put on the screen. God, he was gorgeous.\"<ref name=wtha/> Another Hunter friend, actor [[Van Williams]], a native of [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], who also guest starred in the series, said, \"Things didn't go right for him, and they should have, because if anybody deserved to be a big star, it was Jeffrey Hunter.\"<ref name=wtha/>\n\nIn taking the ''Temple Houston'' role, Hunter was compelled by a scheduling conflict to bow out of John Ford's  final western film, ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]''.<ref name=wtha/>\n\n====''Star Trek''====\nAlthough ''Temple Houston'' did not survive beyond twenty-six weeks, Hunter accepted the lead role of [[Christopher Pike (Star Trek)|Captain Christopher Pike]] in \"[[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Cage]]\", the first [[Television pilot|pilot episode]] of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. [[Clegg Hoyt]], Hunter's co-star in ''[[The True Story of Jesse James]]'', appeared in this pilot as Pitcairn, the transporter chief of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']]. Hunter declined to film a second ''Star Trek'' pilot requested by NBC in 1965, and decided to concentrate on motion pictures. He told the press, \"I was asked to do it, but had I accepted, I would have been tied up much longer than I care to be. I have several things brewing now and they should be coming to a head in the next few weeks.

He guest starred on shows like ''Insight'', ''Daniel Boone'' and ''The FBI''.\n\nAfter a cameo in ''[[A Guide for the Married Man]]'' (1967) he had the lead in a Western shot in Spain for [[Sidney W.
