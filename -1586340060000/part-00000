The Latin [[adjectives]] {{lang|la|Ligusticum}} (as in {{lang|la|Mare Ligusticum}}) and ''Liguscus''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dicolatin.com/|title=DicoLatin|website=DicoLatin}}</ref> reveal the original root of the name, ''ligusc-'': in the Latin name -sc- was shortened to -s-, and later turned into the -r- of {{lang|la|Liguria}}, according to [[rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]].

Since these are all coastal regions, the shared formant may relate to a shared descent from pre-Indo-European, maritime peoples, <ref>Room, \"Placenames of the World,\" 2006</ref><ref>Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville, Premiers Habitants de l'Europe (2nd edition 1889-1894)</ref> and/or the hypothetical [[Tyrsenian languages|Tyrsenian]] and [[Vasconic]] language families resectively. This argument is weakened, however, by the fact that the name Etruscan is a relatively late [[exonym]] and the relevant endonym, used\nof the Etruscans themselves, was ''Rasenna'' or ''Ra\u015bna''. (In Greek this mutated into  ''Turs\u0113noi''  and ''Tyrr\u0113noi''; in Latin it became ''Etruria'' and ''Toscana''.)\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Spezia monterosso.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A view of [[Cinque Terre]].]]\nLiguria is bordered by [[France]] ([[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]]) to the west, [[Piedmont]] to the north, and [[Emilia-Romagna]] and [[Tuscany]] to the east.

The narrow strip of land is bordered by the [[Ligurian Sea|sea]], the [[Alps]] and the [pz\u00e7(\u00e8\u00a7'gb npa\u00e9\u00e7\"\u00e9!\u00a7\u00e8bg\u00e9ap\u00e7\"!'(u\u00e8bg vp\u00e7!'(yt bgvpz\u00e7!'ytb gvp\u00e7'!(y\u00a7b g\u00e7\u00e8'(ytb g(uz'tybg e(i'utygb 'zi(ybgt [Apennines]] mountains. Some mountains rise above {{convert|2000|m|abbr=on}}; the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] line runs at an average altitude of about {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on}}. The highest point of the region is the summit of [[Monte Saccarello]] ({{convert|2201|m|abbr=on|disp=comma}}).\n\nThe winding arched extension goes from [[Ventimiglia, Italy|Ventimiglia]] to [[La Spezia]]. Of this, {{convert|3524.08|km2|2|abbr=on}} are mountainous (65% of the total) and {{convert|891.95|km2|2|abbr=on}} are hills (35% of the total). Liguria's natural reserves cover 12% of the entire region, or {{convert|600|km2|abbr=on}} of land. They are made up of one national reserve, six large parks, two smaller parks and three nature reserves.\n\nThe continental shelf is very narrow, and so steep it descends almost immediately to considerable depths along its {{convert|350|km|adj=on}} coastline. Except for the [[Portovenere]] and [[Portofino]] promontories, the coast is generally not very jagged, and is often high. At the mouths of the biggest watercourses are small beaches, but there are no deep bays and natural harbours except at [[Genoa]] and [[La Spezia]].\n\nThe hills lying immediately beyond the coast together with the sea account for a mild climate year-round. Average winter temperatures are {{convert|7|to|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and summer temperatures are {{convert|23|to|24|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, which make for a pleasant stay even in the dead of winter. Rainfall can be abundant at times, as mountains very close to the coast create an [[orographic]] effect. Genoa and [[La Spezia]] can see up to {{convert|2000|mm|-1|abbr=on}} of rain in a year; other areas instead show the normal Mediterranean rainfall of {{convert|500|to|800|mm|-1|abbr=on}} annually.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|List of museums in Liguria}}\n\n===Prehistory and Roman times===\n\n[[File:Regio IX Liguria.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Map of Roman Liguria, between the River [[Var (river)|Var]] and [[Magra]].]]\n[[File:La Ligurie de Mercator 1576.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Map of ancient Liguria, between the river [[Var (river)|Var]] and [[Magra]]. [[Cannes]] is annexed by France in [[Middle Ages]].]]\n[[File:County of nice.svg|250px|thumb|[[County of Nice]] western part of Liguria annexed by France in 1860.]]\n\nAccording to classical sources, the Ligurians ([[Ligures]]) once lived in a far broader territory than present-day Liguria. For example, the Greek colony of [[Marseille|Massalia]], modern [[Marseille]]{{Citation needed|reason=no source mentions this|date=March 2020}}, was recorded to lie in Ligurian territory.\n\n[[File:Luna Amphitheater1.jpg|thumb|250px|The Roman amphitheatre of [[Luni, Italy|Luni]] (1st century AD).]]\n\nDuring the first [[Punic War]], the ancient Ligurians were divided, some of them siding with [[Carthage]] and a minority with Rome, whose allies included the future [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]]. Under [[Augustus]], Liguria was designated a [[Augustan regions of Italy|region of Italy]] (''Regio IX Liguria'') stretching from the coast to the banks of the [[Po River]]. The great Roman roads (Aurelia and Julia Augusta on the coast, Postumia and Aemilia Scauri towards the inland) helped strengthen territorial unity and increase communication and trade. Important towns developed on the coast, of which evidence is left in the ruins of [[Albenga]], Ventimiglia and [[Luni, Italy|Luni]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\n[[File:Strabismo di Venere - Botticelli.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Simonetta Vespucci]], a native Ligurian who was a famous beauty during the Renaissance, may have been the model for [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli's]] ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'']]\n\nBetween the 4th and the 10th centuries Liguria was dominated by the [[Byzantine]]s, the [[Lombards]] of King [[Rothari]] (about 641) and the [[Franks]] (about 774). It was also invaded by [[Saracen]] and [[Normans|Norman]] raiders. In the 10th century, once the danger of pirates decreased, the Ligurian territory was divided into three marches: Obertenga (east), Arduinica (west) and Aleramica (centre). In the 11th and 12th centuries the marches were split into fees, and then with the strengthening of the bishops\u2019 power, the feudal structure began to partially weaken. The main Ligurian towns, especially on the coast, became city-states, over which [[Genoa]] soon extended its rule. Inland, however, fiefs belonging to noble families survived for a very long time.{{fix|text=vague}}\n\n[[File:Repubblica di Genova.png|thumbnail|250px|Territories of the [[Republic of Genoa]] (shown in purple).]]\n\nBetween the 11th century (when the Genoese ships played a major role in the first crusade, carrying knights and troops to the Middle-East for a fee) and the 15th century, the [[Republic of Genoa]] experienced an extraordinary political and commercial success (mainly spice trades with the Orient). It was one of the most powerful maritime republics in the [[Mediterranean]] from the 12th to the 14th century: after the decisive victory in the [[battle of Meloria (1284)]], it acquired control over the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] and was present in the nerve centres of power during the last phase of the Byzantine empire, [[Genoese colonies|having colonies]] up to [[Black Sea]] and [[Crimean]].\n\nAfter the introduction of the title of doge for life (1339) and the election of [[Simone Boccanegra]], Genoa resumed its struggles against the [[Marquis of Finale]] and the Counts of [[Laigueglia]] and it conquered again the territories of [[Finale Ligure|Finale]], [[Oneglia]] and [[Porto Maurizio]]. In spite of its military and commercial successes, Genoa fell prey to the internal factions which put pressure on its political structure. Due to the vulnerable situation, the rule of the republic went to the hands of the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti family]] of [[Milan]]. After their expulsion by the popular forces under Boccanegra's lead, the republic remained in Genoese hands until 1396, when the internal instability led the doge [[Antoniotto Adorno]] to surrender the title of Seignior of Genoa to the king of France. The French were driven away in 1409 and Liguria went back under Milanese control in 1421, thus remaining until 1435.\n\n===Early modern===\n\n[[File:Portrait of a Man, Said to be Christopher Columbus.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Posthumous portrait of [[Christopher Columbus]], by [[Sebastiano del Piombo]].]]\n\nThe alternation of French and Milanese dominions over Liguria went on until the first half of the 16th century. The French influence ceased in 1528, when [[Andrea Doria]] allied with the powerful king of Spain and imposed an aristocratic government, which gave the republic a relative stability for about 250 years.\n\n[[File:Louis14-Versailles1685.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Reparation faite \u00e0 Louis XIV par le Doge de G\u00eanes.15 mai 1685'' by [[Claude Guy Halle]].]]\n\nGenoese explorer [[Christopher Columbus]]'s speculative proposal to reach the [[East Indies]] by sailing westward received the support of the Spanish crown, which saw in it an opportunity to gain the upper hand over rival powers in the contest for the lucrative [[spice trade]] with [[Asia]]. During his first voyage in 1492, instead of reaching Japan as he had intended, Columbus landed in the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas archipelago]], at a locale he named ''San Salvador''. Over the course of three more voyages, Columbus visited the [[Greater Antilles|Greater]] and [[Lesser Antilles]], as well as the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of [[Venezuela]] and Central America, claiming them for the [[Spanish Empire]].\n\nThe value of trade routes through Genoa to the Near East declined during the [[Age of Discovery]], when Portuguese explorers discovered routes to Asia around the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. The international crises of the seventeenth century, which ended for Genoa with the 1684 [[Bombardment of Genoa|bombardment]] by [[Louis XIV]]\u2019s fleet, restored French influence over the republic. Consequently, the Ligurian territory was crossed by the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmontese]] and [[Holy Roman Empire|Austrian]] armies when these two states came into conflict with France.  Austria occupied Genoa in 1746, but the [[Habsburg]] troops were driven away by a popular insurrection. Napoleon's first Italian campaign marked the end of the oligarchic Genoese state, which was transformed into the [[Ligurian Republic]], modelled on the [[First French Republic|French Republic]]. After the union of Oneglia and Loano (1801), Liguria was annexed to the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] (1805) and divided by [[Napoleon]] into three departments: [[Montenotte (department)]], with capital [[Savona]], [[G\u00eanes]], with capital [[Genoa]] and the department of the [[Apennines]], with the capital [[Chiavari]].\n\n[[File:Mazzini.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Giuseppe Mazzini]] was a patriot, philosopher and politician of the 19th century.]]\n\n===Late modern and contemporary===\n\nAfter a short period of independence in 1814, the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815) decided that Liguria should be annexed to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. The Genoese uprising against the House of Savoy in 1821, which was put down with great bloodshed, aroused the population's national sentiments. Some of the most prestigious figures of ''[[Risorgimento]]'' were born in Liguria ([[Giuseppe Mazzini]], [[Goffredo Mameli|Mameli]], [[Nino Bixio]]). Italian patriot and general [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], who was born in the neighbouring [[Nice]] (then part of the Sardinian state), started his [[Expedition of the Thousand]] on the evening of 5 May 1860 from a rock in Quarto, a quarter of Genoa.\n\nIn late 19th and early 20th century, the region's economic growth was remarkable: steel mills and ship yards flourished along the coast from [[Imperia]] to [[La Spezia]], while the port of Genoa became the main commercial hub of industrializing Northern Italy. During the tragic period of the [[Second World War]], Liguria experienced heavy bombings, hunger and two years of occupation by the [[Nazi|German]] troops, against whom a liberation struggle was led\u2014among the most effective in Italy. When Allied troops eventually entered Genoa, they were welcomed by Italian partisans who, in a successful insurrection, had freed the city and accepted the surrender of the local German command. For this feat the city has been awarded the gold medal for military valour.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|footnote = Source: [[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]] 2001\n|1861 |829000\n|1871 |884000\n|1881 |936000\n|1901 |1086000\n|1911 |1207000\n|1921 |1338000\n|1931 |1423000\n|1936 |1467000\n|1951 |1567000\n|1961 |1735000\n|1971 |1854000\n|1981 |1808000\n|1991 |1676000\n|2001 |1572000\n|2011 |1617000\n|2017 |1557533\n}}\n\nThe population density of Liguria is much higher than the national average (300 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>, or 770 per sq mi), being only less than [[Campania]]'s, [[Lombardy]]'s and [[Lazio]]'s.

Its territory is crossed by the [[Alps]] and the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] [[Mountain chain|mountains chains]]. Liguria is bordered by [[France]] ([[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]]) to the west, [[Piedmont]] to the north, and [[Emilia-Romagna]] and [[Tuscany]] to the east. It lies on the [[Ligurian Sea]], and has a population of 1,557,533. The region is part of the [[Alps\u2013Mediterranean Euroregion|Alps-Mediterranean Euroregion]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Liguria'' predates [[Latin]] and is of obscure origin. The Latin [[adjectives]] {{lang|la|Ligusticum}} (as in {{lang|la|Mare Ligusticum}}) and ''Liguscus''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dicolatin.com/|title=DicoLatin|website=DicoLatin}}</ref> reveal the original root of the name, ''ligusc-'': in the Latin name -sc- was shortened to -s-, and later turned into the -r- of {{lang|la|Liguria}}, according to [[rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]]. Compare {{lang-grc|\u03bb\u03af\u03b3\u03c5\u03c2|translit=L\u00edgus|translation=a Ligurian, a person from Liguria}} whence {{lang|grc-Latn|Ligustik\u1e17}} {{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03b9\u03b3\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae}} {{translation|the name of the place Liguria}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ligus&la=greek#lexicon|title=Greek Word Study Tool|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref> The name derives from the ancient [[Ligures]] people, although in reality the territory of this people were much larger than those of the current region and included all the North-west Italy south to [[Po (river)|Po river]], and south-eastern [[France]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nSome scholars see a possible connection with [[Old European languages]], as the formant -sc- (-sk-) is also present in names like [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], [[Euskadi]] (the [[endonym]] of the Basques), and [[Gascony|Gascon]]. Since these are all coastal regions, the shared formant may relate to a shared descent from pre-Indo-European, maritime peoples, <ref>Room, \"Placenames of the World,\" 2006</ref><ref>Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville, Premiers Habitants de l'Europe (2nd edition 1889-1894)</ref> and/or the hypothetical [[Tyrsenian languages|Tyrsenian]] and [[Vasconic]] language families resectively. This argument is weakened, however, by the fact that the name Etruscan is a relatively late [[exonym]] and the relevant endonym, used\nof the Etruscans themselves, was ''Rasenna'' or ''Ra\u015bna''. (In Greek this mutated into  ''Turs\u0113noi''  and ''Tyrr\u0113noi''; in Latin it became ''Etruria'' and ''Toscana''.)\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Spezia monterosso.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A view of [[Cinque Terre]].]]\nLiguria is bordered by [[France]] ([[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]]) to the west, [[Piedmont]] to the north, and [[Emilia-Romagna]] and [[Tuscany]] to the east. It lies on the [[Ligurian Sea]]. The narrow strip of land is bordered by the [[Ligurian Sea|sea]], the [[Alps]] and the [[Apennines]] mountains. Some mountains rise above {{convert|2000|m|abbr=on}}; the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] line runs at an average altitude of about {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on}}. The highest point of the region is the summit of [[Monte Saccarello]] ({{convert|2201|m|abbr=on|disp=comma}}).\n\nThe winding arched extension goes from [[Ventimiglia, Italy|Ventimiglia]] to [[La Spezia]]. Of this, {{convert|3524.08|km2|2|abbr=on}} are mountainous (65% of the total) and {{convert|891.95|km2|2|abbr=on}} are hills (35% of the total). Liguria's natural reserves cover 12% of the entire region, or {{convert|600|km2|abbr=on}} of land. They are made up of one national reserve, six large parks, two smaller parks and three nature reserves.\n\nThe continental shelf is very narrow, and so steep it descends almost immediately to considerable depths along its {{convert|350|km|adj=on}} coastline. Except for the [[Portovenere]] and [[Portofino]] promontories, the coast is generally not very jagged, and is often high. At the mouths of the biggest watercourses are small beaches, but there are no deep bays and natural harbours except at [[Genoa]] and [[La Spezia]].\n\nThe hills lying immediately beyond the coast together with the sea account for a mild climate year-round. Average winter temperatures are {{convert|7|to|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and summer temperatures are {{convert|23|to|24|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, which make for a pleasant stay even in the dead of winter. Rainfall can be abundant at times, as mountains very close to the coast create an [[orographic]] effect. Genoa and [[La Spezia]] can see up to {{convert|2000|mm|-1|abbr=on}} of rain in a year; other areas instead show the normal Mediterranean rainfall of {{convert|500|to|800|mm|-1|abbr=on}} annually.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|List of museums in Liguria}}\n\n===Prehistory and Roman times===\n\n[[File:Regio IX Liguria.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Map of Roman Liguria, between the River [[Var (river)|Var]] and [[Magra]].]]\n[[File:La Ligurie de Mercator 1576.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Map of ancient Liguria, between the river [[Var (river)|Var]] and [[Magra]]. [[Cannes]] is annexed by France in [[Middle Ages]].]]\n[[File:County of nice.svg|250px|thumb|[[County of Nice]] western part of Liguria annexed by France in 1860.]]\n\nAccording to classical sources, the Ligurians ([[Ligures]]) once lived in a far broader territory than present-day Liguria. For example, the Greek colony of [[Marseille|Massalia]], modern [[Marseille]]{{Citation needed|reason=no source mentions this|date=March 2020}}, was recorded to lie in Ligurian territory.\n\n[[File:Luna Amphitheater1.jpg|thumb|250px|The Roman amphitheatre of [[Luni, Italy|Luni]] (1st century AD).]]\n\nDuring the first [[Punic War]], the ancient Ligurians were divided, some of them siding with [[Carthage]] and a minority with Rome, whose allies included the future [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]]. Under [[Augustus]], Liguria was designated a [[Augustan regions of Italy|region of Italy]] (''Regio IX Liguria'') stretching from the coast to the banks of the [[Po River]]. The great Roman roads (Aurelia and Julia Augusta on the coast, Postumia and Aemilia Scauri towards the inland) helped strengthen territorial unity and increase communication and trade. Important towns developed on the coast, of which evidence is left in the ruins of [[Albenga]], Ventimiglia and [[Luni, Italy|Luni]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\n[[File:Strabismo di Venere - Botticelli.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Simonetta Vespucci]], a native Ligurian who was a famous beauty during the Renaissance, may have been the model for [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli's]] ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'']]\n\nBetween the 4th and the 10th centuries Liguria was dominated by the [[Byzantine]]s, the [[Lombards]] of King [[Rothari]] (about 641) and the [[Franks]] (about 774). It was also invaded by [[Saracen]] and [[Normans|Norman]] raiders. In the 10th century, once the danger of pirates decreased, the Ligurian territory was divided into three marches: Obertenga (east), Arduinica (west) and Aleramica (centre). In the 11th and 12th centuries the marches were split into fees, and then with the strengthening of the bishops\u2019 power, the feudal structure began to partially weaken. The main Ligurian towns, especially on the coast, became city-states, over which [[Genoa]] soon extended its rule. Inland, however, fiefs belonging to noble families survived for a very long time.{{fix|text=vague}}\n\n[[File:Repubblica di Genova.png|thumbnail|250px|Territories of the [[Republic of Genoa]] (shown in purple).]]\n\nBetween the 11th century (when the Genoese ships played a major role in the first crusade, carrying knights and troops to the Middle-East for a fee) and the 15th century, the [[Republic of Genoa]] experienced an extraordinary political and commercial success (mainly spice trades with the Orient). It was one of the most powerful maritime republics in the [[Mediterranean]] from the 12th to the 14th century: after the decisive victory in the [[battle of Meloria (1284)]], it acquired control over the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] and was present in the nerve centres of power during the last phase of the Byzantine empire, [[Genoese colonies|having colonies]] up to [[Black Sea]] and [[Crimean]].\n\nAfter the introduction of the title of doge for life (1339) and the election of [[Simone Boccanegra]], Genoa resumed its struggles against the [[Marquis of Finale]] and the Counts of [[Laigueglia]] and it conquered again the territories of [[Finale Ligure|Finale]], [[Oneglia]] and [[Porto Maurizio]]. In spite of its military and commercial successes, Genoa fell prey to the internal factions which put pressure on its political structure. Due to the vulnerable situation, the rule of the republic went to the hands of the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti family]] of [[Milan]]. After their expulsion by the popular forces under Boccanegra's lead, the republic remained in Genoese hands until 1396, when the internal instability led the doge [[Antoniotto Adorno]] to surrender the title of Seignior of Genoa to the king of France. The French were driven away in 1409 and Liguria went back under Milanese control in 1421, thus remaining until 1435.\n\n===Early modern===\n\n[[File:Portrait of a Man, Said to be Christopher Columbus.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Posthumous portrait of [[Christopher Columbus]], by [[Sebastiano del Piombo]].]]\n\nThe alternation of French and Milanese dominions over Liguria went on until the first half of the 16th century. The French influence ceased in 1528, when [[Andrea Doria]] allied with the powerful king of Spain and imposed an aristocratic government, which gave the republic a relative stability for about 250 years.\n\n[[File:Louis14-Versailles1685.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Reparation faite \u00e0 Louis XIV par le Doge de G\u00eanes.15 mai 1685'' by [[Claude Guy Halle]].]]\n\nGenoese explorer [[Christopher Columbus]]'s speculative proposal to reach the [[East Indies]] by sailing westward received the support of the Spanish crown, which saw in it an opportunity to gain the upper hand over rival powers in the contest for the lucrative [[spice trade]] with [[Asia]]. During his first voyage in 1492, instead of reaching Japan as he had intended, Columbus landed in the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas archipelago]], at a locale he named ''San Salvador''. Over the course of three more voyages, Columbus visited the [[Greater Antilles|Greater]] and [[Lesser Antilles]], as well as the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of [[Venezuela]] and Central America, claiming them for the [[Spanish Empire]].\n\nThe value of trade routes through Genoa to the Near East declined during the [[Age of Discovery]], when Portuguese explorers discovered routes to Asia around the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. The international crises of the seventeenth century, which ended for Genoa with the 1684 [[Bombardment of Genoa|bombardment]] by [[Louis XIV]]\u2019s fleet, restored French influence over the republic. Consequently, the Ligurian territory was crossed by the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmontese]] and [[Holy Roman Empire|Austrian]] armies when these two states came into conflict with France.  Austria occupied Genoa in 1746, but the [[Habsburg]] troops were driven away by a popular insurrection. Napoleon's first Italian campaign marked the end of the oligarchic Genoese state, which was transformed into the [[Ligurian Republic]], modelled on the [[First French Republic|French Republic]]. After the union of Oneglia and Loano (1801), Liguria was annexed to the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] (1805) and divided by [[Napoleon]] into three departments: [[Montenotte (department)]], with capital [[Savona]], [[G\u00eanes]], with capital [[Genoa]] and the department of the [[Apennines]], with the capital [[Chiavari]].\n\n[[File:Mazzini.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Giuseppe Mazzini]] was a patriot, philosopher and politician of the 19th century.]]\n\n===Late modern and contemporary===\n\nAfter a short period of independence in 1814, the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815) decided that Liguria should be annexed to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. The Genoese uprising against the House of Savoy in 1821, which was put down with great bloodshed, aroused the population's national sentiments. Some of the most prestigious figures of ''[[Risorgimento]]'' were born in Liguria ([[Giuseppe Mazzini]], [[Goffredo Mameli|Mameli]], [[Nino Bixio]]). Italian patriot and general [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], who was born in the neighbouring [[Nice]] (then part of the Sardinian state), started his [[Expedition of the Thousand]] on the evening of 5 May 1860 from a rock in Quarto, a quarter of Genoa.\n\nIn late 19th and early 20th century, the region's economic growth was remarkable: steel mills and ship yards flourished along the coast from [[Imperia]] to [[La Spezia]], while the port of Genoa became the main commercial hub of industrializing Northern Italy. During the tragic period of the [[Second World War]], Liguria experienced heavy bombings, hunger and two years of occupation by the [[Nazi|German]] troops, against whom a liberation struggle was led\u2014among the most effective in Italy. When Allied troops eventually entered Genoa, they were welcomed by Italian partisans who, in a successful insurrection, had freed the city and accepted the surrender of the local German command. For this feat the city has been awarded the gold medal for military valour.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|footnote = Source: [[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]] 2001\n|1861 |829000\n|1871 |884000\n|1881 |936000\n|1901 |1086000\n|1911 |1207000\n|1921 |1338000\n|1931 |1423000\n|1936 |1467000\n|1951 |1567000\n|1961 |1735000\n|1971 |1854000\n|1981 |1808000\n|1991 |1676000\n|2001 |1572000\n|2011 |1617000\n|2017 |1557533\n}}\n\nThe population density of Liguria is much higher than the national average (300 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>, or 770 per sq mi), being only less than [[Campania]]'s, [[Lombardy]]'s and [[Lazio]]'s. In the [[province of Genoa]], it reaches almost 500 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>, whereas in the provinces of [[province of imperia|Imperia]] and [[province of savona|Savona]] it is less than 200 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>. The Spanish traveller [[Pedro Tafur]], noting it from sea in 1436, remarked \"To one who does not know it, the whole coast from Savona to Genoa looks like one continuous city, so well inhabited is it, and so thickly studded with houses,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/tafur.html#ch1|title=Pero Tafur|website=depts.washington.edu}}</ref> and today over 80% of the regional population still lives permanently near to the coast, where all the four major cities above 50,000 are located: [[Genoa]] (pop. 610,000), [[La Spezia]] (pop. 95,000), [[Savona]] (pop. 62,000) and [[Sanremo]] (pop. 56,000).\n\nThe population of Liguria has been declining from 1971 to 2001, most markedly in the cities of Genoa, Savona and La Spezia.

So the Ligurian industry has turned towards a widely diversified range of high-quality and high-tech products (food, shipbuilding, electrical engineering and electronics, petrochemicals, aerospace etc.). Nonetheless, the regions still maintains a flourishing shipbuilding sector (yacht construction and maintenance, cruise liner building, military shipyards).<ref name=\"regportraits1\"/>\nIn the services sector, the gross value-added per worker in Liguria is 4% above the national average. This is due to the increasing diffusion of modern technologies, particularly in commerce and tourism.\nA good motorways network ({{convert|376|km|0|abbr=on}} in 2000) makes communications with the border regions relatively easy. The main motorway is located along the coastline, connecting the main ports of Nice (in France), Savona, Genoa and La Spezia. The number of passenger cars per 1000 inhabitants (524 in 2001) is below the national average (584).\nIn average, about 17 million tonnes of cargo are shipped from the main ports of the region and about 57 million tonnes enter the region.<ref name=\"regportraits1\"/> The [[Port of Genoa]], with a trade volume of 58.6 million tonnes <ref name=\"genova1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.porto.genova.it/dati/traffico_porto/traffico_porto.jsp |title=Autorit\u00e0 Portuale di Genova&nbsp;\u2014 Traffico porto |publisher=Porto.genova.it |date= |accessdate=26 December 2008 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202145356/http://www.porto.genova.it/dati/traffico_porto/traffico_porto.jsp |archivedate= 2 December 2008 |df= }}</ref> it is the first port of Italy,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.istat.it/dati/catalogo/20070406_00/inf_07_05_statistiche_trasporti_marittimi_2002_2004.pdf |title=Inf_07_05_Statistiche dei trasporti marittimi 2002\u20132004 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=26 December 2008}}</ref> the second in terms of [[twenty-foot equivalent units]] after the port of [[transshipment]] of [[Gioia Tauro]], with a trade volume of 1.86 million TEUs.<ref name=\"genova1\"/> The main destinations for the cargo-passenger traffic are Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Barcelona and Canary Islands.\n\nThe [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was 49.9 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 2.8% of Italy's economic output.

However, airlines underwent a fundamental transition to a [[point-to-point transit|point-to-point]] system, which gets customers to their destination in one flight instead of two or three. The massive scale of the A380 design was able to achieve a very low cost for passenger seat-distance, but efficiency here within the hub-and-spoke paradigm was not able to overcome the efficiency of fewer flights required in the point-to-point system. Furthermore, American carriers had been using a multihub strategy, that would only justify the need for a handful of VLAs (''very large aircraft'' with more than 400 seats) such as the A380, and having too few VLAs meant that they could not get achieve economy of scale to spread out the enormous fixed cost of the VLA support infrastructure.<ref>[https://www.businessinsider.com/american-airlines-exec-reveals-why-company-doesnt-use-airbus-a380-2019-4]</ref> Consequently, the orders for VLAs slowed in the mid-2010s, as widebody twin jets now offer similar range and greater fuel efficiency, giving airlines more flexibility at a lower upfront cost.<ref>\"[http://centreforaviation.com/analysis/asian-airlines-changing-presence-at-london-heathrow-pt-1-cathay-and-sia-increase-capacity-96950 Asian Airlines' changing presence at London Heathrow]\", Centre for Aviation, 13 February 2013.</ref><ref name=guangzhou>\"[http://centreforaviation.com/analysis/china-southerns-a380-problems-may-not-be-solved-by-possible-air-china-partnership-103063 China Southern's A380 problems may not be solved by possible Air China partnership]\", CAPA: Centre for Aviation, 2 April 2013.</ref><ref name=spar>Sparaco, Pierre. \"[http://aviationweek.com/awin/opinion-mega-transports-hobbled-their-size Opinion: Mega-Transports Hobbled By Their Size]\" ''[[Aviation Week & Space Technology]]'', 3 March 2014</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title= United Airlines does not see a fit for Airbus A380 |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/04/united-airlines-fleet-idUSL1N0YQ00Z20150604 |agency= Reuters |date= 4 June 2015 |last= Dastin|first= Jeffrey}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n\n===Overview===\n[[File:Airbus A380 cross section.svg|thumb|upright|The A380 cabin cross-section with [[economy-class]] seating]]\nThe A380 was initially offered in two models: the ''A380-800'' and the ''A380F''.\n\nThe A380-800's original configuration carried 555 passengers in a [[travel class|three-class]] configuration<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airbus.com/en/aircraftfamilies/passenger_comfort.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825115419/http://www.airbus.com/en/aircraftfamilies/passenger_comfort.html|archivedate=25 August 2009|title=Airbus A380 Cabin|publisher=Airbus |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref> or 853 passengers (538 on the main deck and 315 on the upper deck) in a single-class economy configuration.

Airbus is reacting to a changing economy; the recession which began in 2008 saw a drop in market percentage of first class and business seats to six percent and an increase in budget economy travellers. Among other causes is the reluctance of employers to pay for executives to travel in First or Business Class. Airbus' chief of cabin marketing, Ingo Wuggestzer, told Aviation Week and Space Technology that the standard three class cabin no longer reflected market conditions. The 11 seat row on the A380 is accompanied by similar options on other widebodies: nine across on the [[Airbus A330]] and ten across on the [[Airbus A350|A350]].<ref>Flottau, Jens, In a squeeze, Aviation Week & Space Technology, 27 April \u2013 10 May 2015, p. 64</ref>\n\n===Integration with infrastructure and regulations===\n\n====Ground operations====\n[[File:Qatar Airways Airbus A380-800 at Heathrow Airport Terminal 4 before Flying to Doha, 6 Jan 2015.jpg|thumb|[[Aircraft ground handling]] with separate [[jetway]]s for the main and upper deck, and [[ground support equipment]]]]\nIn the 1990s, aircraft manufacturers were planning to introduce larger planes than the [[Boeing 747]].

However, airlines underwent a fundamental transition to a [[point-to-point transit|point-to-point]] system, which gets customers to their destination in one flight instead of two or three. The massive scale of the A380 design was able to achieve a very low cost for passenger seat-distance, but efficiency here within the hub-and-spoke paradigm was not able to overcome the efficiency of fewer flights required in the point-to-point system. Furthermore, American carriers had been using a multihub strategy, that would only justify the need for a handful of VLAs (''very large aircraft'' with more than 400 seats) such as the A380, and having too few VLAs meant that they could not get achieve economy of scale to spread out the enormous fixed cost of the VLA support infrastructure.<ref>[https://www.businessinsider.com/american-airlines-exec-reveals-why-company-doesnt-use-airbus-a380-2019-4]</ref> Consequently, the orders for VLAs slowed in the mid-2010s, as widebody twin jets now offer similar range and greater fuel efficiency, giving airlines more flexibility at a lower upfront cost.<ref>\"[http://centreforaviation.com/analysis/asian-airlines-changing-presence-at-london-heathrow-pt-1-cathay-and-sia-increase-capacity-96950 Asian Airlines' changing presence at London Heathrow]\", Centre for Aviation, 13 February 2013.</ref><ref name=guangzhou>\"[http://centreforaviation.com/analysis/china-southerns-a380-problems-may-not-be-solved-by-possible-air-china-partnership-103063 China Southern's A380 problems may not be solved by possible Air China partnership]\", CAPA: Centre for Aviation, 2 April 2013.</ref><ref name=spar>Sparaco, Pierre. \"[http://aviationweek.com/awin/opinion-mega-transports-hobbled-their-size Opinion: Mega-Transports Hobbled By Their Size]\" ''[[Aviation Week & Space Technology]]'', 3 March 2014</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title= United Airlines does not see a fit for Airbus A380 |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/04/united-airlines-fleet-idUSL1N0YQ00Z20150604 |agency= Reuters |date= 4 June 2015 |last= Dastin|first= Jeffrey}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n\n===Overview===\n[[File:Airbus A380 cross section.svg|thumb|upright|The A380 cabin cross-section with [[economy-class]] seating]]\nThe A380 was initially offered in two models: the ''A380-800'' and the ''A380F''.\n\nThe A380-800's original configuration carried 555 passengers in a [[travel class|three-class]] configuration<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airbus.com/en/aircraftfamilies/passenger_comfort.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825115419/http://www.airbus.com/en/aircraftfamilies/passenger_comfort.html|archivedate=25 August 2009|title=Airbus A380 Cabin|publisher=Airbus |accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref> or 853 passengers (538 on the main deck and 315 on the upper deck) in a single-class economy configuration.

The APU also powers electric generators that provide auxiliary electric power to the aircraft.<ref>{{Cite report|work=Hamilton and Sundstrand |title=Airbus A380 Fact sheet |url=http://www.hamiltonsundstrand.com/StaticFiles/HS/Communications/General/Documents/A380%20Fact%20Sheet_June%202011.pdf |access-date=24 April 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302205101/http://www.hamiltonsundstrand.com/StaticFiles/HS/Communications/General/Documents/A380%20Fact%20Sheet_June%202011.pdf |archivedate=2 March 2013  }}</ref>\n\n===Passenger provisions===\n{{main|Seat configurations of Airbus A380}}\n[[File:Airbus A380-861, Emirates AN1721793.jpg|thumb|10 across [[economy class]] seating]]\n[[File:Airbus A380-861, Emirates AN1385446.jpg|thumb|Emirates [[business class]]]]\n[[File:Etihad Airways aircraft interiors demo ITB 2017 (08).JPG|thumb|Etihad The Residence Apartment with bedroom, living room and an en-suite shower room\non Airbus A380-800]]\n\nThe A380-800's [[Aircraft cabin|cabin]] has {{convert|550|m2|sqft|0}} of usable floor space,<ref>{{cite web |title= Airbus A380 Facts & Figures |date= June 2018 |publisher= Airbus |url= https://www.airbus.com/content/dam/corporate-topics/publications/backgrounders/Backgrounder-Airbus-Commercial-Aircraft-A380-Facts-and-Figures-EN.pdf }}</ref> 40% more than the next largest airliner, the [[Boeing 747-8]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/boeings-747-8-vs-a380-a-titanic-tussle-205137/|title=Boeing's 747-8 vs. A380: A titanic tussle|first=Max|last=Kingsley-Jones|work=Flight International|date=17 February 2006|accessdate=25 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe cabin has features to reduce traveller fatigue such as a quieter interior and higher pressurisation than previous generations of aircraft; the A380 is pressurised to the equivalent altitude of {{convert|1520|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} up to {{convert|12000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Airbus A380 Brief|url=http://a380airbus.com/airbus-a380-cabins/|accessdate=19 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130422021427/http://a380airbus.com/airbus-a380-cabins/|archive-date=22 April 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"norris_wagner_book\"/>{{rp|129}} It has 50% less cabin noise, 50% more cabin area and volume, larger windows, bigger overhead bins, and {{convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=on}} extra headroom versus the 747\u2013400.<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Aircraft \u2013 Airbus A380|url=http://www.globalaircraft.org/planes/airbus_a380.pl |accessdate=19 June 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"a380_figures\">{{cite web|title=Fascinating figures about the A380 |publisher=Airbus |url=http://events.airbus.com/a380/seeing/learnandplay/figures1.asp |accessdate=1 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704190610/http://events.airbus.com/a380/seeing/learnandplay/figures1.asp |archivedate=4 July 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Seating options range from 3-room {{convert|12|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} \"residence\" in first class to 11-across in economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airbus.com/aircraftfamilies/passengeraircraft/a380family/own-the-sky/cabin/|title=Cabin of Airbus A380|work=airbus|access-date=24 April 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231132208/http://www.airbus.com/aircraftfamilies/passengeraircraft/a380family/own-the-sky/cabin/|archivedate=31 December 2016}}</ref> A380 economy seats are up to {{convert|48|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide in a 10-abreast configuration,<ref>{{cite web|title=Onboard the Airbus A380|publisher=[[Fodors]]|url=http://fodors.com/news/story_2432.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020004918/http://fodors.com/news/story_2432.html|archivedate=20 October 2007 |accessdate=6 March 2012}}</ref> compared with the 10-abreast configuration on the 747-400 that typically has seats {{convert|44.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide.<ref>{{cite web|title=747-400 Cross Sections|publisher=Boeing|url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/747family/pf/pf_cross_section.html|accessdate=19 June 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080611225956/http://www.boeing.com/commercial/747family/pf/pf_cross_section.html |archivedate= 11 June 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> On other aircraft, economy seats range from {{convert|41.5|to|52.3|cm|in|abbr=on}} in width.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smarttravelasia.com/economy.htm|title=A survey of the best airline economy seats|last=Verghese|first=Vijay|year=2011|publisher=Smarttravelasia.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520010120/http://smarttravelasia.com/economy.htm|archivedate=20 May 2011|url-status=live|accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe A380's upper and lower decks are connected by two stairways, one [[Bow (ship)|fore]] and one [[aft]], with both being wide enough to accommodate two passengers side by side; this cabin arrangement allows multiple seat configurations.

Airbus is reacting to a changing economy; the recession which began in 2008 saw a drop in market percentage of first class and business seats to six percent and an increase in budget economy travellers. Among other causes is the reluctance of employers to pay for executives to travel in First or Business Class. Airbus' chief of cabin marketing, Ingo Wuggestzer, told Aviation Week and Space Technology that the standard three class cabin no longer reflected market conditions. The 11 seat row on the A380 is accompanied by similar options on other widebodies: nine across on the [[Airbus A330]] and ten across on the [[Airbus A350|A350]].<ref>Flottau, Jens, In a squeeze, Aviation Week & Space Technology, 27 April \u2013 10 May 2015, p. 64</ref>\n\n===Integration with infrastructure and regulations===\n\n====Ground operations====\n[[File:Qatar Airways Airbus A380-800 at Heathrow Airport Terminal 4 before Flying to Doha, 6 Jan 2015.jpg|thumb|[[Aircraft ground handling]] with separate [[jetway]]s for the main and upper deck, and [[ground support equipment]]]]\nIn the 1990s, aircraft manufacturers were planning to introduce larger planes than the [[Boeing 747]].

However, a misprogrammed superintelligence, which by definition is smarter than humans in solving practical problems it encounters in the course of pursuing its goals, would realize that allowing itself to be shut down and modified might interfere with its ability to accomplish its current goals. If the superintelligence therefore decides to resist shutdown and modification, it would (again, by definition) be smart enough to outwit its programmers if there is otherwise a \"level playing field\" and if the programmers have taken no prior precautions. In general, attempts to solve the control problem ''after'' superintelligence is created, are likely to fail because a superintelligence would likely have superior ''strategic planning'' abilities to humans, and (all things equal) would be more successful at finding ways to dominate humans than humans would be able to ''post facto'' find ways to dominate the superintelligence. The control problem asks: What prior precautions can the programmers take to successfully prevent the superintelligence from catastrophically misbehaving?<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /><!-- Chapter 6: Cognitive superpowers -->\n\n===Existential risk===\n{{main article|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence}}\n\nHumans currently dominate other species because the [[human brain]] has some distinctive capabilities that the brains of other animals lack. Some scholars, such as philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] and AI researcher [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]], argue that if AI surpasses humanity in general intelligence and becomes [[superintelligence|superintelligent]], then this new superintelligence could become powerful and difficult to control: just as the fate of the [[mountain gorilla]] depends on human goodwill, so might the fate of humanity depend on the actions of a future machine superintelligence.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /><!-- preface --> Some scholars, including Nobel laureate physicists [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Frank Wilczek]], publicly advocated starting research into solving the (probably extremely difficult) control problem well before the first superintelligence is created, and argue that attempting to solve the problem after superintelligence is created would be too late, as an uncontrollable rogue superintelligence might successfully resist post-hoc efforts to control it.<ref name=\"hawking editorial\">{{cite news |title=Stephen Hawking: 'Transcendence looks at the implications of artificial intelligence&nbsp;\u2013 but are we taking AI seriously enough?' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/stephen-hawking-transcendence-looks-at-the-implications-of-artificial-intelligence--but-are-we-taking-ai-seriously-enough-9313474.html |accessdate=14 June 2016 |publisher=[[The Independent (UK)]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Stephen Hawking warns artificial intelligence could end mankind |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30290540 |accessdate=14 June 2016 |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2 December 2014}}</ref> Waiting until superintelligence seems to be imminent could also be too late, partly because the control problem might take a long time to satisfactorily solve (and so some preliminary work needs to be started as soon as possible), but also because of the possibility of a sudden [[intelligence explosion]] from sub-human to super-human AI, in which case there might not be any substantial or unambiguous warning before superintelligence arrives.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Anticipating artificial intelligence|journal=Nature|date=26 April 2016|volume=532|issue=7600|page=413|doi=10.1038/532413a|pmid=27121801}}</ref> In addition, it is possible that insights gained from the control problem could in the future end up suggesting that some architectures for [[artificial general intelligence]] (AGI) are more predictable and amenable to control than other architectures, which in turn could helpfully nudge early AGI research toward the direction of the more controllable architectures.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /><!-- Chapter 14: The strategic picture -->\n\n===The problem of perverse instantiation===\nAutonomous AI systems may be assigned the wrong goals by accident.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Russell |first1=Stuart |author1-link=Stuart J.

Some hypothetical examples where goals might be instantiated in a ''perverse'' way that the programmers did not intend:<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /><!-- Chapter 8: Is the default outcome doom? -->\n\n* A superintelligence programmed to \"maximize the [[expected utility|expected]] time-discounted integral of your future reward signal\", might short-circuit its reward pathway to maximum strength, and then (for reasons of [[instrumental convergence]]) exterminate the unpredictable human race and convert the entire Earth into a fortress on constant guard against any even slight unlikely alien attempts to disconnect the reward signal.\n* A superintelligence programmed to \"maximize human happiness\", might implant electrodes into the pleasure center of our brains, or [[mind uploading|upload]] a human into a computer and tile the universe with copies of that computer running a five-second loop of maximal happiness again and again.\n\nRussell has noted that, on a technical level, omitting an implicit goal can result in harm: \"A system that is optimizing a function of {{math|n}} variables, where the objective depends on a subset of size {{math|k<n}}, will often set the remaining unconstrained variables to extreme values; if one of those unconstrained variables is actually something we care about, the solution found may be highly undesirable.

[[DeepMind]] researcher Laurent Orseau gives, as a simple hypothetical example, a case of a [[reinforcement learning]] robot that sometimes gets legitimately commandeered by humans when it goes outside: how should the robot best be programmed so that it does not accidentally and quietly learn to avoid going outside, for fear of being commandeered and thus becoming unable to finish its daily tasks? Orseau also points to an experimental Tetris program that learned to pause the screen indefinitely to avoid losing. Orseau argues that these examples are similar to the capability control problem of how to install a button that shuts off a superintelligence, without motivating the superintelligence to take action to prevent humans from pressing the button.<ref name=bbc-google />\n\nIn the past, even pre-tested weak AI systems have occasionally caused harm, ranging from minor to catastrophic, that was unintended by the programmers. For example, in 2015, possibly due to human error, a German worker was crushed to death by a robot at a Volkswagen plant that apparently mistook him for an auto part.<ref name=wp-computer /> In 2016, Microsoft launched a chatbot, [[Tay (bot)|Tay]], that learned to use racist and sexist language.<ref name=bbc-google /><ref name=wp-computer>{{cite news|title='Press the big red button': Computer experts want kill switch to stop robots from going rogue|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/06/09/press-the-big-red-button-computer-experts-want-kill-switch-to-stop-robots-from-going-rogue/|accessdate=12 June 2016|work=Washington Post}}</ref> The [[University of Sheffield]]'s [[Noel Sharkey]] states that an ideal solution would be if \"an AI program could detect when it is going wrong and stop itself\", but cautions the public that solving the problem in the general case would be \"a really enormous scientific challenge\".<ref name=bbc-google />\n\nIn 2017, [[DeepMind]] released AI Safety Gridworlds, which evaluate AI algorithms on nine safety features, such as whether the algorithm wants to turn off its own kill switch.

Experts do not currently know how to reliably program abstract values such as happiness or autonomy into a machine. It is also not currently known how to ensure that a complex, upgradeable, and possibly even self-modifying artificial intelligence will retain its goals through upgrades.<ref>Fallenstein, Benja, and Nate Soares. \"Problems of self-reference in self-improving space-time embedded intelligence.\" Artificial General Intelligence. Springer International Publishing, 2014. 21-32.</ref> Even if these two problems can be practically solved, any attempt to create a superintelligence with explicit, directly-programmed human-friendly goals runs into a problem of [[#The problem of perverse instantiation|perverse instantiation]].<ref name=superintelligence /><!-- Chapter 8: Is the default outcome doom? -->\n\n===Indirect normativity===\nWhile direct normativity, such as the fictional [[Three Laws of Robotics]], directly specifies the desired normative outcome, other (perhaps more promising) proposals suggest specifying some type of ''indirect'' process for the superintelligence to determine what human-friendly goals entail. [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]] has proposed coherent extrapolated volition (CEV), where the AI's meta-goal would be something like \"achieve that which we would have wished the AI to achieve if we had thought about the matter long and hard.\"<ref>[[Eliezer Yudkowsky]]. \"Complex value systems in friendly AI.\" Artificial general intelligence. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2011. 388-393.</ref> Different proposals of different kinds of indirect normativity exist, with different, and sometimes unclearly grounded, meta-goal content (such as \"do what is right\"), and with different non-convergent assumptions for how to practice [[decision theory]] and [[epistemology]]. As with direct normativity, it is currently unknown how to reliably translate even concepts like \"[[counterfactual thinking|would have]]\" into the 1's and 0's that a machine can act on, and how to ensure the AI reliably retains its meta-goals in the face of modification or self-modification.<ref name=superintelligence/><!-- Chapter 13: Choosing the criteria for choosing --><ref name=\"AGIResponses\"/>\n===Deference to observed human behavior===\n\nIn ''[[Human Compatible]]'', AI researcher [[Stuart J. Russell]] proposes that AI systems be designed to serve human preferences as inferred from observing human behavior.  Accordingly, Russell lists three principles to guide the development of beneficial machines.  He emphasizes that these principles are not meant to be explicitly coded into the machines; rather, they are intended for the human developers.  The principles are as follows:<ref name=\"HC\">{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Stuart |date=October 8, 2019 |title=Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control |url=https://archive.org/details/humancompatiblea0000russ |location=United States |publisher=Viking |page= |isbn=978-0-525-55861-3 |author-link=Stuart J.

The machine is initially uncertain about what those preferences are.\n\n3. The ultimate source of information about human preferences is human behavior.}}\n\nThe \"preferences\" Russell refers to \"are all-encompassing; they cover everything you might care about, arbitrarily far into the future.\"<ref name=\"HC\"/>{{rp|173}}  Similarly, \"behavior\" includes any choice between options,<ref name=\"HC\"/>{{rp|177}} and the uncertainty is such that some probability, which may be quite small, must be assigned to every logically possible human preference.<ref name=\"HC\"/>{{rp|201}}\n\nHadfield-Menell et al. have proposed that agents can learn their human teachers' [[utility function]]s by observing and interpreting reward signals in their environments; they call this process cooperative [[Reinforcement learning#Inverse reinforcement learning|inverse reinforcement learning]] (CIRL).<ref name=\"CIRL\">{{cite arXiv |last1=Hadfield-Menell |first1=Dylan |last2=Dragan |first2=Anca |last3=Abbeel |first3=Pieter |author-link3=Pieter Abbeel |last4=Russell |first4=Stuart |author-link4=Stuart J.

This approach is motivated by the expected difficulty of determining whether an AGI-generated answer is both valid and safe by human inspection alone.  While there is some pessimism regarding training by debate, Lucas Perry of the [[Future of Life Institute]] characterized it as potentially \"a powerful truth seeking process on the path to beneficial AGI.\"<ref name=\"IrvingInterview\">{{cite web |url=https://futureoflife.org/2019/03/06/ai-alignment-through-debate-with-geoffrey-irving/ |title=AI Alignment Podcast: AI Alignment through Debate with Geoffrey Irving |date=March 6, 2019 |last=Perry |first=Lucas |accessdate=April 7, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Capability control ==\nSome proposals aim to prevent the initial superintelligence from being ''capable'' of causing harm, even if it wants to. One tradeoff is that all such methods have the limitation that, if after the first deployment, superintelligences continue to grow smarter and smarter and more and more widespread, inevitably some malign superintelligence somewhere will eventually escape its capability control methods. Therefore, Bostrom and others recommend capability control methods only as an emergency fallback to supplement motivational control methods.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /><!-- Chapter 9: The control problem -->\n\n===Kill switch===\nJust as humans can be killed or otherwise disabled, computers can be turned off. One challenge is that, if being turned off prevents it from achieving its current goals, a superintelligence would likely try to prevent its being turned off. Just as humans have systems in place to deter or protect themselves from assailants, such a superintelligence would have a motivation to engage in strategic planning to prevent itself being turned off. This could involve:<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /><!-- Chapter 9: The control problem --> \n* Hacking other systems to install and run backup copies of itself, or creating other allied superintelligent agents without kill switches.\n* Pre-emptively disabling anyone who might want to turn the computer off.\n* Using some kind of clever ruse, or superhuman persuasion skills, to talk its programmers out of wanting to shut it down.\n\n===Utility balancing and safely interruptible agents===\nOne partial solution to the kill-switch problem involves \"utility balancing\": Some utility-based agents can, with some important caveats, be programmed to compensate themselves exactly for any lost utility caused by an interruption or shutdown, in such a way that they end up being indifferent to whether they are interrupted or not. The caveats include a severe unsolved problem that, as with [[evidential decision theory]], the agent might follow a catastrophic policy of \"managing the news\".<ref name=corrigibility>Soares, Nate, et al. \"Corrigibility.\" Workshops at the Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. 2015.</ref> Alternatively, in 2016, scientists Laurent Orseau and Stuart Armstrong proved that a broad class of agents, called safely interruptible agents (SIA), can eventually learn to become indifferent to whether their kill switch gets pressed.<ref name=bbc-google /><ref name=sia>Orseau, Laurent, and Stuart Armstrong. \"Safely Interruptible Agents.\" [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], June 2016.</ref>\n\nBoth the utility balancing approach and the 2016 SIA approach have the limitation that, if the approach succeeds and the superintelligence is completely indifferent to whether the kill switch is pressed or not, the superintelligence is also unmotivated to care one way or another about whether the kill switch remains functional, and could incidentally and innocently disable it in the course of its operations (for example, for the purpose of removing and recycling an unnecessary component). Similarly, if the superintelligence innocently creates and deploys superintelligent sub-agents, it will have no motivation to install human-controllable kill switches in the sub-agents. More broadly, the proposed architectures, whether weak or superintelligent, will in a sense \"act as if the kill switch can never be pressed\" and might therefore fail to make any contingency plans to arrange a graceful shutdown. This could hypothetically create a practical problem even for a weak AI; by default, an AI designed to be safely interruptible might have difficulty understanding that it will be shut down for scheduled maintenance at a certain time and planning accordingly so that it would not be caught in the middle of a task during shutdown. The breadth of what types of architectures are or can be made SIA-compliant, as well as what types of counter-intuitive unexpected drawbacks each approach has, are currently under research.<ref name=corrigibility /><ref name=sia />\n\n===AI box===\n{{Main|AI box}}\n\nOne of the tradeoffs of placing the AI into a sealed \"box\", is that some AI box proposals reduce the usefulness of the superintelligence, rather than merely reducing the risks; a superintelligence running on a closed system with no inputs or outputs at all might be safer than one running on a normal system, but would also not be as useful.

However, a misprogrammed superintelligence, which by definition is smarter than humans in solving practical problems it encounters in the course of pursuing its goals, would realize that allowing itself to be shut down and modified might interfere with its ability to accomplish its current goals. If the superintelligence therefore decides to resist shutdown and modification, it would (again, by definition) be smart enough to outwit its programmers if there is otherwise a \"level playing field\" and if the programmers have taken no prior precautions. In general, attempts to solve the control problem ''after'' superintelligence is created, are likely to fail because a superintelligence would likely have superior ''strategic planning'' abilities to humans, and (all things equal) would be more successful at finding ways to dominate humans than humans would be able to ''post facto'' find ways to dominate the superintelligence.

Some hypothetical examples where goals might be instantiated in a ''perverse'' way that the programmers did not intend:<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /><!-- Chapter 8: Is the default outcome doom? -->\n\n* A superintelligence programmed to \"maximize the [[expected utility|expected]] time-discounted integral of your future reward signal\", might short-circuit its reward pathway to maximum strength, and then (for reasons of [[instrumental convergence]]) exterminate the unpredictable human race and convert the entire Earth into a fortress on constant guard against any even slight unlikely alien attempts to disconnect the reward signal.\n* A superintelligence programmed to \"maximize human happiness\", might implant electrodes into the pleasure center of our brains, or [[mind uploading|upload]] a human into a computer and tile the universe with copies of that computer running a five-second loop of maximal happiness again and again.\n\nRussell has noted that, on a technical level, omitting an implicit goal can result in harm: \"A system that is optimizing a function of {{math|n}} variables, where the objective depends on a subset of size {{math|k<n}}, will often set the remaining unconstrained variables to extreme values; if one of those unconstrained variables is actually something we care about, the solution found may be highly undesirable.

[[DeepMind]] researcher Laurent Orseau gives, as a simple hypothetical example, a case of a [[reinforcement learning]] robot that sometimes gets legitimately commandeered by humans when it goes outside: how should the robot best be programmed so that it does not accidentally and quietly learn to avoid going outside, for fear of being commandeered and thus becoming unable to finish its daily tasks? Orseau also points to an experimental Tetris program that learned to pause the screen indefinitely to avoid losing. Orseau argues that these examples are similar to the capability control problem of how to install a button that shuts off a superintelligence, without motivating the superintelligence to take action to prevent humans from pressing the button.<ref name=bbc-google />\n\nIn the past, even pre-tested weak AI systems have occasionally caused harm, ranging from minor to catastrophic, that was unintended by the programmers. For example, in 2015, possibly due to human error, a German worker was crushed to death by a robot at a Volkswagen plant that apparently mistook him for an auto part.<ref name=wp-computer /> In 2016, Microsoft launched a chatbot, [[Tay (bot)|Tay]], that learned to use racist and sexist language.<ref name=bbc-google /><ref name=wp-computer>{{cite news|title='Press the big red button': Computer experts want kill switch to stop robots from going rogue|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/06/09/press-the-big-red-button-computer-experts-want-kill-switch-to-stop-robots-from-going-rogue/|accessdate=12 June 2016|work=Washington Post}}</ref> The [[University of Sheffield]]'s [[Noel Sharkey]] states that an ideal solution would be if \"an AI program could detect when it is going wrong and stop itself\", but cautions the public that solving the problem in the general case would be \"a really enormous scientific challenge\".<ref name=bbc-google />\n\nIn 2017, [[DeepMind]] released AI Safety Gridworlds, which evaluate AI algorithms on nine safety features, such as whether the algorithm wants to turn off its own kill switch.

Experts do not currently know how to reliably program abstract values such as happiness or autonomy into a machine. It is also not currently known how to ensure that a complex, upgradeable, and possibly even self-modifying artificial intelligence will retain its goals through upgrades.<ref>Fallenstein, Benja, and Nate Soares. \"Problems of self-reference in self-improving space-time embedded intelligence.\" Artificial General Intelligence.

As with direct normativity, it is currently unknown how to reliably translate even concepts like \"[[counterfactual thinking|would have]]\" into the 1's and 0's that a machine can act on, and how to ensure the AI reliably retains its meta-goals in the face of modification or self-modification.<ref name=superintelligence/><!-- Chapter 13: Choosing the criteria for choosing --><ref>{{cite journal|title=Responses to catastrophic AGI risk: a survey|journal=[[Physica Scripta]]|date=19 December 2014|volume=90|issue=1|author1=Kaj Sotala|author2-link=Roman Yampolskiy|author2=Roman Yampolskiy}}</ref>\n\n===Deference to observed human behavior===\n\nIn ''[[Human Compatible]]'', AI researcher [[Stuart J.

One tradeoff is that all such methods have the limitation that, if after the first deployment, superintelligences continue to grow smarter and smarter and more and more widespread, inevitably some malign superintelligence somewhere will eventually escape its capability control methods. Therefore, Bostrom and others recommend capability control methods only as an emergency fallback to supplement motivational control methods.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /><!-- Chapter 9: The control problem -->\n\n===Kill switch===\nJust as humans can be killed or otherwise disabled, computers can be turned off. One challenge is that, if being turned off prevents it from achieving its current goals, a superintelligence would likely try to prevent its being turned off. Just as humans have systems in place to deter or protect themselves from assailants, such a superintelligence would have a motivation to engage in strategic planning to prevent itself being turned off. This could involve:<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /><!-- Chapter 9: The control problem --> \n* Hacking other systems to install and run backup copies of itself, or creating other allied superintelligent agents without kill switches.\n* Pre-emptively disabling anyone who might want to turn the computer off.\n* Using some kind of clever ruse, or superhuman persuasion skills, to talk its programmers out of wanting to shut it down.\n\n===Utility balancing and safely interruptible agents===\nOne partial solution to the kill-switch problem involves \"utility balancing\": Some utility-based agents can, with some important caveats, be programmed to compensate themselves exactly for any lost utility caused by an interruption or shutdown, in such a way that they end up being indifferent to whether they are interrupted or not. The caveats include a severe unsolved problem that, as with [[evidential decision theory]], the agent might follow a catastrophic policy of \"managing the news\".<ref name=corrigibility>Soares, Nate, et al. \"Corrigibility.\" Workshops at the Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. 2015.</ref> Alternatively, in 2016, scientists Laurent Orseau and Stuart Armstrong proved that a broad class of agents, called safely interruptible agents (SIA), can eventually learn to become indifferent to whether their kill switch gets pressed.<ref name=bbc-google /><ref name=sia>Orseau, Laurent, and Stuart Armstrong. \"Safely Interruptible Agents.\" [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], June 2016.</ref>\n\nBoth the utility balancing approach and the 2016 SIA approach have the limitation that, if the approach succeeds and the superintelligence is completely indifferent to whether the kill switch is pressed or not, the superintelligence is also unmotivated to care one way or another about whether the kill switch remains functional, and could incidentally and innocently disable it in the course of its operations (for example, for the purpose of removing and recycling an unnecessary component). Similarly, if the superintelligence innocently creates and deploys superintelligent sub-agents, it will have no motivation to install human-controllable kill switches in the sub-agents. More broadly, the proposed architectures, whether weak or superintelligent, will in a sense \"act as if the kill switch can never be pressed\" and might therefore fail to make any contingency plans to arrange a graceful shutdown. This could hypothetically create a practical problem even for a weak AI; by default, an AI designed to be safely interruptible might have difficulty understanding that it will be shut down for scheduled maintenance at a certain time and planning accordingly so that it would not be caught in the middle of a task during shutdown. The breadth of what types of architectures are or can be made SIA-compliant, as well as what types of counter-intuitive unexpected drawbacks each approach has, are currently under research.<ref name=corrigibility /><ref name=sia />\n\n===AI box===\n{{Main|AI box}}\n\nOne of the tradeoffs of placing the AI into a sealed \"box\", is that some AI box proposals reduce the usefulness of the superintelligence, rather than merely reducing the risks; a superintelligence running on a closed system with no inputs or outputs at all might be safer than one running on a normal system, but would also not be as useful. In addition, keeping control of a sealed superintelligence computer could prove difficult, if the superintelligence has superhuman persuasion skills, or if it has superhuman strategic planning skills that it can use to find and craft a winning strategy, such as acting in a way that tricks its programmers into (possibly falsely) believing the superintelligence is safe or that the benefits of releasing the superintelligence outweigh the risks.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chalmers | first1 = David | authorlink = David Chalmers | year = 2010 | title = The singularity: A philosophical analysis | url = | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 17 | issue = 9\u201310| pages = 7\u201365 }}</ref>\n\n===Oracle===\nAn oracle is a hypothetical AI designed to answer questions and prevented from gaining any goals or subgoals that involve modifying the world beyond its limited environment.<ref name=\"bostrom chapter 10 page 145\">{{cite book|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|title=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199678112|chapter=Chapter 10: Oracles, genies, sovereigns, tools (page 145)|quote=An oracle is a question-answering system.

The oracle could tell humans how to successfully build a strong AI, and perhaps provide answers to difficult moral and philosophical problems requisite to the success of the project.  However, oracles may share many of the goal definition issues associated with general-purpose superintelligence.  An oracle would have an incentive to escape its controlled environment so that it can acquire more computational resources and potentially control what questions it is asked.<ref name=\"HC\"/>{{rp|162}}  Oracles may not be truthful, possibly lying to promote hidden agendas. To mitigate this, Bostrom suggests building multiple oracles, all slightly different, and comparing their answers to reach a consensus.<ref name=\"bostrom chapter 10 page 147\">{{cite book|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|title=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199678112|chapter=Chapter 10: Oracles, genies, sovereigns, tools (page 147)|quote=For example, consider the risk that an oracle will answer questions not in a maximally truthful way but in such a way as to subtly manipulate us into promoting its own hidden agenda. One way to slightly mitigate this threat could be to create multiple oracles, each with a slightly different code and a slightly different information base. A simple mechanism could then compare the answers given by the different oracles and only present them for human viewing if all the answers agree.}}<!--|accessdate=29 March 2018--></ref>\n\n=== AGI Nanny ===\n\nThe AGI Nanny is a proposed strategy for preventing the creation of a dangerous superintelligence as well as addressing other major threats to human well-being until a superintelligence can be safely created.  It entails the creation of a smarter-than-human, but not superintelligent, AGI system connected to a large surveillance network, with the goal of monitoring humanity and protecting it from danger.  Sotala and Yampolskiy note that the problem of goal definition would not necessarily be easier for the AGI Nanny than for AGI in general, concluding that \"the AGI Nanny seems to have promise, but it is unclear whether it can be made to work.\"<ref name=\"AGIResponses\">{{cite journal |url=https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0031-8949/90/1/018001#ps505672s5-4 |title=Responses to catastrophic AGI risk: a survey |first1=Kaj |last1=Sotala |first2=Roman |last2=Yampolskiy |date=19 December 2014 |journal=Physica Scripta |volume=90 |issue=1}}</ref>\n\n=== AGI enforcement ===\nAGI enforcement is a proposed method of controlling powerful AGI systems with other AGI systems.  This could be implemented as a chain of progressively less powerful AI systems, with humans at the other end of the chain.  Each system would control the system just above it in intelligence, while being controlled by the system just below it, or humanity.  However, Sotala and Yampolskiy caution that \"Chaining multiple levels of AI systems with progressively greater capacity seems to be replacing the problem of building a safe AI with a multi-system, and possibly more difficult, version of the same problem.\"<ref name=\"AGIResponses\"/>  Other proposals focus on a group of AGI systems of roughly equal capability, which \"helps guard against individual AGIs 'going off the rails', but it does not help in a scenario where the programming of most AGIs is flawed and leads to non-safe behavior.\"<ref name=\"AGIResponses\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[AI takeover]]\n*[[Existential risk from artificial general intelligence]]\n*[[Friendly artificial intelligence]]\n* [[HAL 9000]]\n* [[Regulation of algorithms]]\n*[[Regulation of artificial intelligence]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Existential risk from artificial intelligence|state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Existential risk from artificial general intelligence]]\n[[Category:Futures studies]]\n[[Category:Philosophy of artificial intelligence]]\n", "name_user": "WeyerStudentOfAgrippa", "label": "safe", "comment": "duplicate ref", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_control_problem"}

The LIRR has also added platform conductors to monitor train boarding, and is instructing crews to announce the gap at the station and to assist passengers.<ref name=\"kelly\" /><ref name=\"melina\" /> Further improvements, including changing railroad operation standards and the viable use of retractable [[gap filler]]s (such as those used in a few [[New York City Subway]] stations) are being examined. The railroad has also retained a consultant to review train operations to suggest further changes.<ref name=\"kelly\" />\n\nSome Syosset residents and politicians, such as current Nassau County Presiding Officer Judy Jacobs, insist the best solution to eliminate the gap problem is to force the LIRR to close the Syosset station and reopen the [[Landia (LIRR station)|Landia]] station to the southwest. Landia is on straight track. A mall is being proposed near the Landia station site. Michael Pally, an [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] board member representing [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]] and who also works for a real estate firm that represents the company proposing construction of the mall, believes the Syosset station should be closed because more parking spaces would be available at Landia. Opponents of the mall believe that opening Landia while closing Syosset will just be a ruse to direct people to the mall. The [[Town of Oyster Bay, New York|Town of Oyster Bay]], which controls the Landia station site, is still gathering information before it makes a decision to ask the LIRR to conduct a study.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Nash |first=Denise |title=Jacobs Still Pressuring LIRR to Bridge the Gap in Syosset |newspaper=Syosset-Jericho Tribune |date=November 17, 2006 |url=http://www.antonnews.com/syossetjerichotribune/2006/11/17/news/ |access-date=2007-03-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014511/http://www.antonnews.com/syossetjerichotribune/2006/11/17/news/ |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |df= }}</ref>\n\n{|table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=200 rowspan=6 valign=top|'''Ground/platform level'''<br/>Exit/entrance\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|<small>[[Side platform|Platform A]], doors will open on the right</small> {{access icon}}\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=100|'''Track 1'''\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=500|\u2190 '''[[Port Jefferson Branch|<span style=color:#{{LIRR color|Port Jefferson}}>Port Jefferson Branch</span>]]''' toward [[Jamaica (LIRR station)|Jamaica]], [[Atlantic Terminal|Atlantic]] or [[Penn Station (LIRR station)|Penn Station]] <small>([[Hicksville (LIRR station)|Hicksville]])</small>\n|-\n|'''Track 2'''\n|'''[[Port Jefferson Branch|<span style=color:#{{LIRR color|Port Jefferson}}>Port Jefferson Branch</span>]]''' toward [[Huntington (LIRR station)|Huntington]] or [[Port Jefferson (LIRR station)|Port Jeff]] <small>([[Cold Spring Harbor (LIRR station)|Cold Spring Harbor]])</small> \u2192\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|<small>[[Side platform|Platform B]], doors will open on the right</small> {{access icon}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Syosset (LIRR station)}}\n{{LIRR links}}\n*[http://syossetscrapbook.freeservers.com/scrapbookpart7.html Syosset Scrapbook(Part 7)] (Includes Syosset Station Photos and History)\n*[http://syossetstation.freehosting.net A History of the Syosset Station by Tom Montalbano]\n*[http://thelirrtoday.blogspot.com/2013/02/interlocking-walkthrough-amott.html AMOTT Interlocking] and [http://thelirrtoday.blogspot.com/2013/03/syosset-platform-gap.html Syosset Platform Gap (The LIRR Today)]\n* [https://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=40.823866,-73.502323&spn=0.004043,0.013433&z=17&layer=c&cbll=40.823866,-73.502323&panoid=SMAcTE6Yttsa6o6tF0hEdQ&cbp=12,51.71,,0,-0.97 Station from Jackson Avenue from Google Maps Street View]\n\n{{LIRR stations navbox}}\n\n[[Category:Syosset, New York]]\n[[Category:Long Island Rail Road stations in Nassau County, New York]]\n[[Category:Railway stations opened in 1854]]\n[[Category:1854 establishments in New York (state)]]\n", "name_user": "Kew Gardens 613", "label": "safe", "comment": "date formats perMOS:DATEFORMATbyscript", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syosset_station"}

Its name is allegedly based on [[scorpion]]s that once lived there, now represented in its flag. Its Catholic parish seat has traditionally been [[Mysl\u00edv]]. Surnames of the village reaching back to the 17th century include Liska, Popule, Cihla, Ciz, and Ticha.\n\n== Genealogy and Immigration to America ==\nSo far, about 88 people born in Nehodiv have been identified as immigrating to America, sorted and profiled on [[FamilySearch]], a high ratio given a population averaging around 300. The earliest [[Immigration|immigrant]] from the village was probably Josefa Zelena (1835-1892) with her husband from Mysliv, Jan Rada, and children who settled in [[Baltimore]] in 1869. She was followed by Josef Kle\u010dka (1852-1926) who arrived in 1870. There he married Marie Hrani\u010dkov\u00e1 (1851-1913) from [[Kv\u00e1\u0161\u0148ovice]]. Josef returned multiple times to visit his mother and siblings, perhaps encouraging other villagers to follow him.\n\nOther early immigrants include V\u00e1clav Kon\u010dal (1843-1925) who brought his wife Marie V\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (1844-1906) to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] around the same year. Never having biological children, the couple adopted V\u00e1clav's brother son V\u00e1clav and Marie's sister's daughter Josefa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M93F-QVF|title=United States Census, 1900|last=Konchal|first=|date=|website=FamilySearch|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA significant number of the immigrants share a [[Genetic testing|DNA]] and blood relation via children of the couple Krystof Sramek (1700-1767) and Katerina Hithova (1705-1760) from Klikarov, Vojovice, and [[Lou\u017en\u00e1|Louzna]] in the 18th century.\n\n* Katerina Sramkova (1727-1798) is the ancestor of the Kotesovec's and the Popule's.\n*Dorota Sramkova (1730-1796) is the ancestor of the Protova's, Blazek's, and Vojtech Zeleny (specifically).\n*Ondrej Sramek (1743-) is the great grandfather of the Poustkova sisters.

Its name is allegedly based on [[scorpion]]s that once lived there, now represented in its flag. Its Catholic parish seat has traditionally been [[Mysl\u00edv]]. Surnames of the village reaching back to the 17th century include Liska, Popule, Cihla, Ciz, and Ticha.\n\n== Genealogy and Immigration to America ==\nSo far, about 88 people born in Nehodiv have been identified as immigrating to America, sorted and profiled on [[FamilySearch]], a high ratio given a population averaging around 300. The earliest [[Immigration|immigrant]] from the village was probably Josefa Zelena (1835-1892) with her husband from Mysliv, Jan Rada, and children who settled in [[Baltimore]] in 1869. She was followed by Josef Kle\u010dka (1852-1926) who arrived in 1870. There he married Marie Hrani\u010dkov\u00e1 (1851-1913) from [[Kv\u00e1\u0161\u0148ovice]]. Josef returned multiple times to visit his mother and siblings, perhaps encouraging other villagers to follow him.\n\nOther early immigrants include V\u00e1clav Kon\u010dal (1843-1925) who brought his wife Marie V\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (1844-1906) to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] around the same year. Never having biological children, the couple adopted V\u00e1clav's brother son V\u00e1clav and Marie's sister's daughter Josefa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M93F-QVF|title=United States Census, 1900|last=Konchal|first=|date=|website=FamilySearch|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA significant number of the immigrants share a [[Genetic testing|DNA]] and blood relation via children of the couple Krystof Sramek (1700-1767) and Katerina Hithova (1705-1760) from Klikarov, Vojovice, and [[Lou\u017en\u00e1|Louzna]] in the 18th century.\n\n* Katerina Sramkova (1727-1798) is the ancestor of the Kotesovec's and the Popule's.\n*Dorota Sramkova (1730-1796) is the ancestor of the Protova's, Blazek's, and Vojtech Zeleny (specifically).\n*Ondrej Sramek (1743-) is the great grandfather of the Poustkova sisters.

Azerbaijan's regime is a curious hybrid, in which semi-presidential institutions operate in the larger context of authoritarianism. The author compares formal Constitutional provisions with the practice of politics in the country, suggesting that formal and informal sources of authority come together to enhance the effective powers of the presidency. In addition to the considerable formal powers laid out in the Constitution, Azerbaijan's president also benefits from the support of the ruling party and informal family and patronage networks. LaPorte concludes by discussing the theoretical implications of this symbiosis between formal and informal institutions in Azerbaijan's semi-presidential regime. |ref=harv }}</ref>}}\n| leader_title1                = [[President of Azerbaijan|President]]\n| leader_name1                = [[Ilham Aliyev]]\n| leader_title2                = [[Vice President of Azerbaijan|Vice President]]\n| leader_name2                = [[Mehriban Aliyeva]]\n| leader_title3                = [[Prime Minister of Azerbaijan|Prime Minister]]\n| leader_name3                = [[Ali Asadov]]\n| legislature                = [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan|National Assembly]]\n| sovereignty_type                = [[History of Azerbaijan|Formation]]\n| established_event1                = [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Democratic Republic]]\n| established_date1                = 28 May 1918\n| established_event2                = [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Socialist Republic]]\n| established_date2                = 28 April 1920\n| established_event3                = Independence from [[Soviet Union]]\n| established_date3                = {{plainlist|\n* 30 August 1991 (declared)\n* 18 October 1991 (independence)\n* 25 December 1991 (completed)}}\n| established_event4                = [[Alma-Ata Protocol|Full membership into the CIS]]\n| established_date4                = 21 December 1991\n| established_event5                = [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 742|Admitted to the]] [[United Nations]]\n| established_date5                = 2 March 1992\n| established_event6                = {{nowrap|[[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] adopted}}\n| established_date6                = 12 November 1995\n| area_km2                = 86600\n| area_rank                = 112th\n| area_sq_mi                = 33436 <!-- Do not remove [[WP:MOSNUM]] -->\n| percent_water                = 1.6\n| population_estimate                = 10,027,874<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2020-02-09|title=Az\u0259rbaycanda \u0259hali say\u0131 da art\u0131b, bo\u015fanmalar da\u2026 -

The president is authorized to form the Cabinet, a collective executive body, accountable to both the President and the National Assembly.<ref name=\"LaPorte2016\" /> The Cabinet of Azerbaijan consists primarily of the prime minister, his deputies, and ministers. The president does not have the right to dissolve the National Assembly but has the right to veto its decisions. To override the presidential veto, the parliament must have a majority of 95 votes. The judicial power is vested in the [[Constitutional Court of Azerbaijan|Constitutional Court]], [[Supreme Court of Azerbaijan|Supreme Court]], and the [[Economic Court of Azerbaijan|Economic Court]]. The president nominates the judges in these courts.

The top or highest tier of the government is the Executive Power headed by President. The President appoints the Cabinet of Ministers and other high-ranking officials. The Local Executive Authority is merely a continuation of Executive Power. The legal status of local state administration in Azerbaijan is determined by the Provision on Local Executive Authority (''Yerli Icra Hakimiyati''), adopted 16 June 1999. In June 2012, the President approved the new Regulation, which granted additional powers to Local Executive Authorities, strengthening their dominant position in Azerbaijan's local affairs<ref>{{cite web |title=Az\u0259rbaycan Prezidentinin R\u0259smi internet s\u0259hif\u0259si |url=https://president.az/ |website=president.az |language=az}}</ref> Chapter 9 of the Constitution of the Azerbaijan Republic addresses major issues of local self-government, such as the legal status of municipalities, types of local self-government bodies, their basic powers and relationships to other official entities. The other nominal tier of governance is municipalities (''B\u0259l\u0259diy\u0259'') and members of municipalities are elected by a general vote in Municipal elections every five years. Currently, there are 1,607 municipalities across the country. The Law on Municipal Elections and the Law on the Status of Municipalities were the first to be adopted in the field of local government (2 July 1999). The Law on Municipal Service regulates the activities of municipal employees, their rights, duties, labor conditions and social benefits, and outlines the structure of the executive apparatus and the organization of municipal service. The Law on the Status of Municipalities regulates the role and structure of municipal bodies and outlines state guarantees of legal and financial autonomy. The law pays special attention to the adoption and execution of municipal programs concerning social protection, social and economic development, and the local environment.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe Security Council is the deliberative body under the president, and he organizes it according to the Constitution. It was established on 10 April 1997. The administrative department is not a part of the president's office but manages the financial, technical and pecuniary activities of both the president and his office.\n\nAlthough Azerbaijan has held several elections since regaining its independence and it has many of the formal institutions of democracy, it remains classified as \"not free\" (on border with \"partly free\") by [[Freedom House]].<ref>{{cite web| title =Azerbaijan \u2013 Freedom House | publisher = FreedomHouse.org | url =http://www.freedomhouse.org/country/azerbaijan| accessdate = 4 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"frh\">{{cite web| title = Combined Average Ratings: Independent Countries 2009| publisher = FreedomHouse.org| year = 2009| url = http://old.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=475&year=2009| accessdate = 10 July 2012}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In recent years, large numbers of Azerbaijani journalists, bloggers, lawyers, and human rights activists have been rounded up and jailed for their criticism of President Aliyev and government authorities.<ref>\"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/jailed-without-trial-in-azerbaijan/2015/03/01/34a1d342-bea1-11e4-bdfa-b8e8f594e6ee_story.html Jailed without trial in Azerbaijan],\" ''[[The Washington Post]]''. 1 March 2015.

The oldest versions of the Book of Dede Korkut consist of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century. The twelve stories that are recorded in these manuscripts are believed to be derived from a cycle of stories and songs circulating among Turkic peoples living in northeastern Anatolia and northwestern Azerbaijan. According to Lewis (1974), an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pecheneks and the Kipchaks), but this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th-century campaigns of the Akkoyunlu Confederation of Turkic tribes against the Georgians, the Abkhaz, and the Greeks in Trebizond. Such stories and songs would have emerged no earlier than the beginning of the 13th century, and the written versions that have reached us would have been composed no later than the beginning of the 15th century. By this time, the Turkic peoples in question had been in touch with Islamic civilization for several centuries, had come to call themselves \"Turcoman\" rather than \"Oghuz,\" had close associations with sedentary and urbanized societies, and were participating in Islamized regimes that included nomads, farmers, and townsmen.

Azerbaijan's regime is a curious hybrid, in which semi-presidential institutions operate in the larger context of authoritarianism. The author compares formal Constitutional provisions with the practice of politics in the country, suggesting that formal and informal sources of authority come together to enhance the effective powers of the presidency. In addition to the considerable formal powers laid out in the Constitution, Azerbaijan's president also benefits from the support of the ruling party and informal family and patronage networks. LaPorte concludes by discussing the theoretical implications of this symbiosis between formal and informal institutions in Azerbaijan's semi-presidential regime. |ref=harv }}</ref>}}\n| leader_title1                = [[President of Azerbaijan|President]]\n| leader_name1                = [[Ilham Aliyev]]\n| leader_title2                = [[Vice President of Azerbaijan|Vice President]]\n| leader_name2                = [[Mehriban Aliyeva]]\n| leader_title3                = [[Prime Minister of Azerbaijan|Prime Minister]]\n| leader_name3                = [[Ali Asadov]]\n| legislature                = [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan|National Assembly]]\n| sovereignty_type                = [[History of Azerbaijan|Formation]]\n| established_event1                = [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Democratic Republic]]\n| established_date1                = 28 May 1918\n| established_event2                = [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Socialist Republic]]\n| established_date2                = 28 April 1920\n| established_event3                = Independence from [[Soviet Union]]\n| established_date3                = {{plainlist|\n* 30 August 1991 (declared)\n* 18 October 1991 (independence)\n* 25 December 1991 (completed)}}\n| established_event4                = [[Alma-Ata Protocol|Full membership into the CIS]]\n| established_date4                = 21 December 1991\n| established_event5                = [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 742|Admitted to the]] [[United Nations]]\n| established_date5                = 2 March 1992\n| established_event6                = {{nowrap|[[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] adopted}}\n| established_date6                = 12 November 1995\n| area_km2                = 86600\n| area_rank                = 112th\n| area_sq_mi                = 33436 <!-- Do not remove [[WP:MOSNUM]] -->\n| percent_water                = 1.6\n| population_estimate                = 10,027,874<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2020-02-09|title=Az\u0259rbaycanda \u0259hali say\u0131 da art\u0131b, bo\u015fanmalar da\u2026 -

The top or highest tier of the government is the Executive Power headed by President. The President appoints the Cabinet of Ministers and other high-ranking officials.

In June 2012, the President approved the new Regulation, which granted additional powers to Local Executive Authorities, strengthening their dominant position in Azerbaijan's local affairs<ref>{{cite web |title=Az\u0259rbaycan Prezidentinin R\u0259smi internet s\u0259hif\u0259si |url=https://president.az/ |website=president.az |language=az}}</ref> Chapter 9 of the Constitution of the Azerbaijan Republic addresses major issues of local self-government, such as the legal status of municipalities, types of local self-government bodies, their basic powers and relationships to other official entities. The other nominal tier of governance is municipalities (''B\u0259l\u0259diy\u0259'') and members of municipalities are elected by a general vote in Municipal elections every five years. Currently, there are 1,607 municipalities across the country. The Law on Municipal Elections and the Law on the Status of Municipalities were the first to be adopted in the field of local government (2 July 1999). The Law on Municipal Service regulates the activities of municipal employees, their rights, duties, labor conditions and social benefits, and outlines the structure of the executive apparatus and the organization of municipal service. The Law on the Status of Municipalities regulates the role and structure of municipal bodies and outlines state guarantees of legal and financial autonomy. The law pays special attention to the adoption and execution of municipal programs concerning social protection, social and economic development, and the local environment.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe Security Council is the deliberative body under the president, and he organizes it according to the Constitution.

The oldest versions of the Book of Dede Korkut consist of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century. The twelve stories that are recorded in these manuscripts are believed to be derived from a cycle of stories and songs circulating among Turkic peoples living in northeastern Anatolia and northwestern Azerbaijan. According to Lewis (1974), an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pecheneks and the Kipchaks), but this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th-century campaigns of the Akkoyunlu Confederation of Turkic tribes against the Georgians, the Abkhaz, and the Greeks in Trebizond. Such stories and songs would have emerged no earlier than the beginning of the 13th century, and the written versions that have reached us would have been composed no later than the beginning of the 15th century. By this time, the Turkic peoples in question had been in touch with Islamic civilization for several centuries, had come to call themselves \"Turcoman\" rather than \"Oghuz,\" had close associations with sedentary and urbanized societies, and were participating in Islamized regimes that included nomads, farmers, and townsmen.
