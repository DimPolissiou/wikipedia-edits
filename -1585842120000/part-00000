The small peninsula is isolated from the rest of Moloka{{okina}}i by cliffs over a quarter-mile high&mdash;the only land access is a [[mule]] trail.\n\nBecause of the small population, Kalawao County does not have the functions of other Hawaii counties. Instead, it is a judicial district of [[Maui County, Hawaii|Maui County]], which includes the rest of the island of Moloka{{okina}}i. The county has no elected government.\n\nIt was developed and used from 1866 to 1969 for settlements for treatment of quarantined persons with [[Hansen's disease]] (leprosy).\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\nThe [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i]], the [[Republic of Hawaii|Republic of Hawai{{okina}}i]], the [[Territory of Hawaii|territory]], and the state of Hawaii exiled persons suffering from [[Hansen's disease]] to the peninsula, from 1866 to 1969. The [[quarantine]] policy was lifted after effective [[Antibiotics|antibiotic]] treatments were developed that could be administered on an outpatient basis and patients could be rendered non-contagious.\n\nMany of the residents chose to remain on the peninsula, as they believed their disfigurements from the illness would make reintegration into society impossible. The state promised that they could live there for the rest of their lives. No new patients, or other permanent residents, were later admitted. Visitors are permitted only as part of official tours. State law prohibits anyone under the age of 16 from visiting or living there, although exceptions have been made for children visiting their relatives.\n\nThe [[Kalaupapa National Historical Park]] was established to preserve the county's history and environment. It is coterminous with the boundaries of Kalawao County.\n\n==Government==\nKalawao County lacks a local, county government. Instead, Kalawao County is administered by the [[Hawaii Department of Health]] because of the history of the settlement and current patients living there. Under Hawaiian state law, the Director of the Hawaii Department of Health, who is appointed by the [[Governor of Hawaii|Governor]], also serves as the [[Mayor of Kalawao County]].<ref name=hadvertiser>{{cite news|first=Robbie|last=Dingeman|title=Smallest county to ban smoking |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Oct/31/ln/ln22a.html |work=[[Honolulu Advertiser]] |date=2002-10-31 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref><ref name=time>{{cite news|first=Nate|last=Rawlings|title=Hawaii Official Killed in Plane Crash |url=http://nation.time.com/2013/12/12/hawaii-official-killed-in-plane-crash/ |work=[[Time Magazine]] |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref><ref name=khon>{{cite news |first=Kristine |last=Uyeno |title=Hawaii Official Killed in Plane Crash |url=http://www.khon2.com/news/loretta-fuddy-committed-to-serving-others |work=[[KHON-TV|KHON]] |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2014-01-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104142321/http://www.khon2.com/news/loretta-fuddy-committed-to-serving-others |archivedate=2014-01-04 }}</ref><ref name=hsa>{{cite news |first=Gregg K. |last=Kakesako |title=Pilot described 'catastrophic engine failure' in Molokai crash |url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/235590541.html?id=235590541 |work=[[Honolulu Star Advertiser]] |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2014-01-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221154659/http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/235590541.html?id=235590541 |archivedate=2013-12-21 |url-status=live }}</ref>  The Mayor holds executive powers within the county; the mayor also appoints a county [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], who is selected from local residents.<ref name=\"doh\">{{cite web |url=http://hawaii.gov/health/about/doh-info.html |title=Department of Health Administrative Offices |publisher=State of Hawai\u02bbi |accessdate=2010-09-28}}</ref> The only county statutes that apply to Kalawao County directly are those on matters of health.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chem.hawaii.edu/uham/counties.html|title=Hawaii's 4 (or 5) Counties|accessdate=2014-01-22}}</ref>\n\nKalawao is part of the First Judicial Circuit, which includes the entire island of [[Oahu]].<ref>\"The Judiciary - State of Hawaii - Annual Report - July 1, 1986 to June 30, 1987\". p16 and p26. https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/109520NCJRS.pdf</ref> For the purpose of notarization, the designated venue for the First Judicial Circuit is \"State of Hawaii, City and County of Honolulu.\"\n\n==Geography==\n\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|53|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|12|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|41|sqmi}} (77.3%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020527061848/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|archive-date=2002-05-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> By land area, it is the [[County statistics of the United States#Smallest counties by land area nationwide|smallest true county in the United States]]; [[Falls Church, Virginia]] is smaller, but is an [[independent city]] with county-level governance and is not a county or part of one.\n\n===Kalaupapa Peninsula===\nKalaupapa Peninsula contains the county's only settlement, [[Kalaupapa, Hawaii|Kalaupapa]].

The small peninsula is isolated from the rest of Moloka{{okina}}i by cliffs over a quarter-mile high&mdash;the only land access is a [[mule]] trail.\n\nBecause of the small population, Kalawao County does not have the functions of other Hawaii counties. Instead, it is a judicial district of [[Maui County, Hawaii|Maui County]], which includes the rest of the island of Moloka{{okina}}i. The county has no elected government.\n\nIt was developed and used from 1866 to 1969 for settlements for treatment of quarantined persons with [[Hansen's disease]] (leprosy).\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\nThe [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i]], the [[Republic of Hawaii|Republic of Hawai{{okina}}i]], the [[Territory of Hawaii|territory]], and the state of Hawaii exiled persons suffering from [[Hansen's disease]] to the peninsula, from 1866 to 1969. The [[quarantine]] policy was lifted after effective [[Antibiotics|antibiotic]] treatments were developed that could be administered on an outpatient basis and patients could be rendered non-contagious.\n\nMany of the residents chose to remain on the peninsula, as they believed their disfigurements from the illness would make reintegration into society impossible. The state promised that they could live there for the rest of their lives. No new patients, or other permanent residents, were later admitted. Visitors are permitted only as part of official tours. State law prohibits anyone under the age of 16 from visiting or living there, although exceptions have been made for children visiting their relatives.\n\nThe [[Kalaupapa National Historical Park]] was established to preserve the county's history and environment. It is coterminous with the boundaries of Kalawao County.\n\n==Government==\nKalawao County lacks a local, county government. Instead, Kalawao County is administered by the [[Hawaii Department of Health]] because of the history of the settlement and current patients living there. Under Hawaiian state law, the Director of the Hawaii Department of Health, who is appointed by the [[Governor of Hawaii|Governor]], also serves as the [[Mayor of Kalawao County]].<ref name=hadvertiser>{{cite news|first=Robbie|last=Dingeman|title=Smallest county to ban smoking |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Oct/31/ln/ln22a.html |work=[[Honolulu Advertiser]] |date=2002-10-31 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref><ref name=time>{{cite news|first=Nate|last=Rawlings|title=Hawaii Official Killed in Plane Crash |url=http://nation.time.com/2013/12/12/hawaii-official-killed-in-plane-crash/ |work=[[Time Magazine]] |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref><ref name=khon>{{cite news |first=Kristine |last=Uyeno |title=Hawaii Official Killed in Plane Crash |url=http://www.khon2.com/news/loretta-fuddy-committed-to-serving-others |work=[[KHON-TV|KHON]] |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2014-01-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104142321/http://www.khon2.com/news/loretta-fuddy-committed-to-serving-others |archivedate=2014-01-04 }}</ref><ref name=hsa>{{cite news |first=Gregg K. |last=Kakesako |title=Pilot described 'catastrophic engine failure' in Molokai crash |url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/235590541.html?id=235590541 |work=[[Honolulu Star Advertiser]] |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2014-01-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221154659/http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/235590541.html?id=235590541 |archivedate=2013-12-21 |url-status=live }}</ref>  The Mayor holds executive powers within the county; the mayor also appoints a county [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], who is selected from local residents.<ref name=\"doh\">{{cite web |url=http://hawaii.gov/health/about/doh-info.html |title=Department of Health Administrative Offices |publisher=State of Hawai\u02bbi |accessdate=2010-09-28}}</ref> The only county statutes that apply to Kalawao County directly are those on matters of health.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chem.hawaii.edu/uham/counties.html|title=Hawaii's 4 (or 5) Counties|accessdate=2014-01-22}}</ref>\n\nKalawao is part of the First Judicial Circuit, which includes the entire island of [[Oahu]].<ref>\"The Judiciary - State of Hawaii - Annual Report - July 1, 1986 to June 30, 1987\". p16 and p26. https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/109520NCJRS.pdf</ref> For the purpose of notarization, the designated venue for the First Judicial Circuit is \"State of Hawaii, City and County of Honolulu.\"\n\n==Geography==\nKalawao County is included in the [[Kahului, Hawaii|Kahului]]-[[Wailuku, Hawaii|Wailuku]]-[[Lahaina, Hawaii|Lahaina]], HI [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|53|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|12|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|41|sqmi}} (77.3%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020527061848/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|archive-date=2002-05-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> By land area, it is the [[County statistics of the United States#Smallest counties by land area nationwide|smallest true county in the United States]]; [[Falls Church, Virginia]] is smaller, but is an [[independent city]] with county-level governance and is not a county or part of one.\n\n===Kalaupapa Peninsula===\nKalaupapa Peninsula contains the county's only settlement, [[Kalaupapa, Hawaii|Kalaupapa]].

The film stars [[Albert Steinr\u00fcck]] and [[Else Heller]] and is about a young woman in Berlin who is driven into poverty and steals a valuable piece of jewelry. She is caught by a police officer which leads to the woman to  attempt to seduce him into letting her go. The film was shot between October and December 1928 at  [[UFA GmbH|UFA]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn Berlin, a young woman named Else is a gorgeous trickster. Her high fashion clothes and perfectly ornamented makeup make her deserving to be peering over diamond cases while batting her eyes in want at the jeweler. She is caught lying and after professing it was the first time, that she needed the money. Even when she meets Albert. she insists her luxurious apartment and belongings are not hers. She maintains her story until she flings herself into his arms and confesses to him, \"I like you.\"\n\nElse thinks about Albert and as she smiles for the first time when she finds the passport photo of Albert in her apartment. Gazing at the photo she smiles comparing him to her criminal, older, and uglier boyfriend in a photo beside her. She stares and smiles at his picture again in the nightclub, when she becomes compelled to return his passport and give him a gift of cigars, a scene that results in a confession of love from both Else and Albert.\n\nAlbert is then at Else's feet, begging her to be his wife, that she can no longer stand the differences between them. He looks up at her in her white elegant dress and she runs away. She breaks away and exposes all her stolen goods from her criminal past. As he considers his fate, her criminal boyfriend enters the scene and a brawl ensues. The boyfriend is killed accidentally, and after struggling with his decision, Albert leaves the scene. In confession to his parents, Albert's father deems that the law is the law, and he must turn himself in. When Else discovers he has done so, she knows what she must do.

The film was shot between October and December 1928 at  [[UFA GmbH|UFA]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn Berlin, a young woman named Else is a gorgeous trickster. Her high fashion clothes and perfectly ornamented makeup make her deserving to be peering over diamond cases while batting her eyes in want at the jeweler. She is caught lying and after professing it was the first time, that she needed the money. Even when she meets Albert. she insists her luxurious apartment and belongings are not hers. She maintains her story until she flings herself into his arms and confesses to him, \"I like you.\"\n\nElse thinks about Albert and as she smiles for the first time when she finds the passport photo of Albert in her apartment. Gazing at the photo she smiles comparing him to her criminal, older, and uglier boyfriend in a photo beside her. She stares and smiles at his picture again in the nightclub, when she becomes compelled to return his passport and give him a gift of cigars, a scene that results in a confession of love from both Else and Albert.\n\nAlbert is then at Else's feet, begging her to be his wife, that she can no longer stand the differences between them. He looks up at her in her white elegant dress and she runs away. She breaks away and exposes all her stolen goods from her criminal past. As he considers his fate, her criminal boyfriend enters the scene and a brawl ensues. The boyfriend is killed accidentally, and after struggling with his decision, Albert leaves the scene. In confession to his parents, Albert's father deems that the law is the law, and he must turn himself in. When Else discovers he has done so, she knows what she must do. Else voluntarily turns herself into the police. Elsie is able to smile once again as Albert follows her and professes he will wait for her. Albert watches Else through a barred doorway as she goes off to jail.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Gustav Fr\u00f6hlich 1929 Alexander Binder 4551-1.jpg|thumb|Gustav Fr\u00f6hlich in 1929]]\n* [[Albert Steinr\u00fcck]] as Hauptwachtmeister Holk\n* [[Else Heller]] as Frau Holk\n* [[Gustav Fr\u00f6hlich]] as Wachtmeister Albert Holk\n* [[Betty Amann]] as Else Kramer\n* [[Hans Adalbert Schlettow]] as Konsul Langen\n* [[Rosa Valetti]] as Frau an der Theke\n* [[Kurt Vespermann]] as Curt Vesperman\n\n==Production==\n''Asphalt'' was made by [[UFA GmbH|UFA]], one of Germany's most prestigious film studios.

studies#Sanad and matn|chains of transmission]] of the hadith back to Muhammad's companions.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} In his view, the real architect of Islamic jurisprudence was [[Al-Shafi\u2018i]] (d. 820 CE/204 AH), who formulated this idea (that legal norms must be formally grounded in scriptural sources) and other elements of classical legal theory in his work ''[[Al-Risala (Al-Shafi\u2018i)|al-risala]]'',{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Jokisch|2015}} but who was preceded by a body of Islamic law not based on primacy of Muhammad's hadiths.\n\nWhile the origin of hadith remains a subject of scholarly controversy, this theory (of Goldziher and Schacht) has given rise to objections, and modern historians generally adopt more cautious, intermediate positions,{{sfn|Jokisch|2015}}  \nand it is generally accepted that early Islamic jurisprudence developed out of a combination of administrative and popular practices shaped by the religious and ethical precepts of Islam.{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}}{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} It continued some aspects of pre-Islamic laws and customs of the lands that fell under Muslim rule in the aftermath of the [[Early Muslim conquests|early conquests]] and modified other aspects, aiming to meet the practical need of establishing Islamic norms of behavior and adjudicating disputes arising in the early Muslim communities.{{sfn|Lapidus|2014|p=125}} Juristic thought gradually developed in study circles, where independent scholars met to learn from a local master and discuss religious topics.{{sfn|Lapidus|2014|p=125}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=31\u201335}} At first, these circles were fluid in their membership, but with time distinct regional legal schools crystallized around shared sets of methodological principles.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=31\u201335}}{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} As the boundaries of the schools became clearly delineated, the authority of their doctrinal tenets came to be vested in a master jurist from earlier times, who was henceforth identified as the school's founder.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=31\u201335}}{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} In the course of the first three centuries of Islam, all legal schools came to accept the broad outlines of classical legal theory, according to which Islamic law had to be firmly rooted in the Quran and hadith.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Lapidus|2014|p=130}}\n\n== Traditional jurisprudence (''fiqh'') ==\n\n{{Main|Fiqh}}\nFiqh is traditionally divided into the fields of ''[[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|u\u1e63\u016bl al-fiqh]]'' (lit. the roots of fiqh), which studies the theoretical principles of jurisprudence, and ''fur\u016b\u02bf al-fiqh'' (lit. the branches of fiqh), which is devoted to elaboration of rulings on the basis of these principles.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Schneider|2014}}\n\n=== Principles of jurisprudence (''u\u1e63\u016bl al-fiqh'') ===\n\n{{Main|Principles of Islamic jurisprudence}}\nClassical jurists held that human reason is a gift from God which should be exercised to its fullest capacity.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|p=15}} However, they believed that use of reason alone is insufficient to distinguish right from wrong, and that rational argumentation must draw its content from the body of transcendental knowledge revealed in the Quran and through the sunnah of Muhammad.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|p=15}}\n\nTraditional theory of Islamic jurisprudence elaborates how scriptures should be interpreted from the standpoint of linguistics and rhetoric.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} It also comprises methods for establishing authenticity of hadith and for determining when the legal force of a scriptural passage is [[Naskh (tafsir)|abrogated]] by a passage revealed at a later date.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} In addition to the Quran and sunnah, the classical theory of Sunni fiqh recognizes two other sources of law: juristic consensus (''[[Ijma|ijma\u02bf]]'') and analogical reasoning (''[[qiyas]]'').{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}} It therefore studies the application and limits of analogy, as well as the value and limits of consensus, along with other methodological principles, some of which are accepted by only certain legal schools.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} This interpretive apparatus is brought together under the rubric of [[ijtihad]], which refers to a jurist's exertion in an attempt to arrive at a ruling on a particular question.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} The theory of [[Twelver Shia]] jurisprudence parallels that of Sunni schools with some differences, such as recognition of reason (''[['Aql|\u02bfaql]]'') as a source of law in place of ''qiyas'' and extension of the notion of sunnah to include traditions of the [[The Twelve Imams|imams]].{{sfn|Kamali|1999|pp=121\u201322}}\n\n==== Sources of sharia ====\n\n{{Main|Sources of sharia}}\n* ''[[Quran]]'': In Islam, the Quran is considered to be the most sacred source of law.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16\u201318}} Classical jurists held its textual integrity to be beyond doubt on account of it having been handed down by many people in each generation, which is known as \"recurrence\" or \"concurrent transmission\" (''taw\u0101tur'').{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16\u201318}} Only several hundred verses of the Quran have direct legal relevance, and they are concentrated in a few specific areas such as inheritance, though other passages have been used as a source for general principles whose legal ramifications were elaborated by other means.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16\u201318}}\n* ''[[Hadith]]'': The body of hadith provides more detailed and practical legal guidance, but it was recognized early on that not all of them were authentic.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16\u201318}} Early Islamic scholars developed a methodology for evaluating their authenticity by assessing trustworthiness of the individuals listed in their transmission chains.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16\u201318}} These criteria narrowed down the vast corpus of prophetic traditions to several thousand \"sound\" hadiths, which were collected in several canonical compilations.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16\u201318}} The hadiths which enjoyed concurrent transmission were deemed unquestionably authentic; however, the vast majority of hadiths were handed down by only one or a few transmitters and were therefore seen to yield only probable knowledge.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16-18}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}} The uncertainty was further compounded by ambiguity of the language contained in some hadiths and Quranic passages.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16\u201318}} Disagreements on the relative merits and interpretation of the textual sources allowed legal scholars considerable leeway in formulating alternative rulings.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}\n* ''Consensus ([[ijma]])'' could in principle elevate a ruling based on probable evidence to absolute certainty.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=21\u201322}}{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} This classical doctrine drew its authority from a series of hadiths stating that the Islamic community could never agree on an error.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=21\u201322}} This form of consensus was technically defined as agreement of all competent jurists in any particular generation, acting as representatives of the community.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=21\u201322}}{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Kamali|1999|p=146}} However, the practical difficulty of obtaining and ascertaining such an agreement meant that it had little impact on legal development.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=21\u201322}}{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} A more pragmatic form of consensus, which could be determined by consulting works of prominent jurists, was used to confirm a ruling so that it could not be reopened for further discussion.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} The cases for which there was a consensus account for less than 1 percent of the body of classical jurisprudence.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=21\u201322}}\n* ''Analogical reasoning ([[qiyas]])'': Qiyas is used to derive a ruling for a situation not addressed in the scripture by analogy with a scripturally based rule.{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}} In a classic example, the Quranic prohibition of drinking wine is extended to all intoxicating substances, on the basis of the \"cause\"  (''\u02bfilla'') shared by these situations, which in this case is identified to be intoxication.{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}} Since the cause of a rule may not be apparent, its selection commonly occasioned controversy and extensive debate.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=23\u201324}} Twelver Shia jurisprudence does not recognize the use of qiyas, but relies on reason (''\u02bfaql'') in its place.{{sfn|Schneider|2014}}\n\n==== Ijtihad ====\n\n{{Main|Ijtihad}}\n[[File:T\u00fcrkischer Mufti.jpg|thumb|Turkish mufti (17th-century Spanish drawing)]]\nThe classical process of ijtihad combined these generally recognized principles with other methods, which were not adopted by all legal schools, such as ''[[istihsan]]'' (juristic preference), ''[[istislah]]'' (consideration of public interest) and ''[[istishab]]'' (presumption of continuity).{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}} A jurist who is qualified to practice ijtihad is known as a ''mujtahid''.{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} The use of independent reasoning to arrive at a ruling is contrasted with ''[[taqlid]]'' (imitation), which refers to following the rulings of a mujtahid.{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} By the beginning of the 10th century, development of Sunni jurisprudence prompted leading jurists to state that the main legal questions had been addressed and the scope of ijtihad was gradually restricted.{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009c}} From the 18th century on, leading Muslim reformers began calling for abandonment of taqlid and renewed emphasis on ijtihad, which they saw as a return to the vitality of early Islamic jurisprudence.{{sfn|Rabb|2009c}}\n\n==== Decision types (''a\u1e25k\u0101m'') ====\n\n{{Main|Ahkam}}\nFiqh is concerned with ethical standards as much as with legal norms, seeking to establish not only what is and is not legal, but also what is morally right and wrong.{{sfn|Coulson|El Shamsy|2019}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|p=145}} Sharia rulings fall into one of five categories known as \u201cthe five decisions\u201d (''al-a\u1e25k\u0101m al-khamsa''): [[Fard|mandatory]] (''far\u1e0d'' or ''w\u0101jib''), [[Mustahabb|recommended]] (''mand\u016bb'' or ''musta\u1e25abb''), [[Mubah|neutral]] (''mub\u0101\u1e25''), [[Makruh|reprehensible]] (''makr\u016bh''), and [[Haram|forbidden]] (''\u1e25ar\u0101m'').{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Schneider|2014}} It is a sin or a crime to perform a forbidden action or not to perform a mandatory action.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} Reprehensible acts should be avoided, but they are not considered to be sinful or punishable in court.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|p=20}} Avoiding reprehensible acts and performing recommended acts is held to be subject of reward in the afterlife, while neutral actions entail no judgement from God.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|p=20}} Jurists disagree on whether the term ''[[Halal|\u1e25al\u0101l]]'' covers the first three or the first four categories.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} The legal and moral verdict depends on whether the action is committed out of necessity (''\u1e0dar\u016bra'') and on the underlying intention (''[[niyya]]''), as expressed in the legal maxim \"acts are [evaluated according] to intention.\"{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}\n\n==== Aims of sharia and public interest ====\n\n{{Main|Maqasid|Maslaha}}\n''Maq\u0101\u1e63id'' (aims or purposes) of sharia  and ''ma\u1e63la\u1e25a'' (welfare or public interest) are two related classical doctrines which have come to play an increasingly prominent role in modern times.{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2\u20136}}{{sfn|Brown|2009}}{{sfn|Gleave|2012}} They were first clearly articulated by [[al-Ghazali]] (d. 1111), who argued that ''maslaha'' was God's general purpose in revealing the divine law, and that its specific aim was preservation of five essentials of human well-being: religion, life, intellect, offspring, and property.{{sfn|Opwis|2007|p=65}} Although most classical-era jurists recognized ''maslaha'' and ''maqasid'' as important legal principles, they held different views regarding the role they should play in Islamic law.{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2\u20136}}{{sfn|Gleave|2012}} Some jurists viewed them as auxiliary rationales constrained by scriptural sources and analogical reasoning.{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2\u20136}}{{sfn|Opwis|2007|pp=66\u201368}} Others regarded them as an independent source of law, whose general principles could override specific inferences based on the letter of scripture.{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2\u20136}}{{sfn|Opwis|2007|pp=68\u201369}} While the latter view was held by a minority of classical jurists, in modern times it came to be championed in different forms by prominent scholars who sought to adapt Islamic law to changing social conditions by drawing on the intellectual heritage of traditional jurisprudence.{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2\u20136}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}}{{sfn|Brown|2009}} These scholars expanded the inventory of ''maqasid'' to include such aims of sharia as reform and women's rights ([[Rashid Rida]]); justice and freedom ([[Mohammed al-Ghazali]]); and human dignity and rights ([[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]]).{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2\u20136}}\n\n===Branches of law===\n\n{{Fiqh}}\n{{Further|Topics of sharia law}}\nThe domain of ''fur\u016b\u02bf al-fiqh'' (lit. branches of fiqh) is traditionally divided into ''\u02bfib\u0101d\u0101t'' (rituals or acts of worship) and ''mu\u02bf\u0101mal\u0101t'' (social relations).{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} Many jurists further divided the body of substantive jurisprudence into \"the four quarters\", called rituals, sales, marriage and injuries.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=28-30}} Each of these terms figuratively stood for a variety of subjects.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=28-30}} For example, the quarter of sales would encompass partnerships, guaranty, gifts, and bequests, among other topics.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=28-30}} Juristic works were arranged as a sequence of such smaller topics, each called a \"book\"

work.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=28-30}}\n\nSome historians distinguish a field of Islamic criminal law, which combines several traditional categories.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009c}}{{sfn|Schneider|2014}} Several crimes with scripturally prescribed punishments are known as ''[[hudud]]''.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} Jurists developed various restrictions which in many cases made them virtually impossible to apply.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} Other crimes involving intentional bodily harm are judged according to a version of ''[[lex talionis]]'' that prescribes a punishment analogous to the crime (''[[qisas]]''), but the victims or their heirs may accept a monetary compensation (''[[Diya (Islam)|diya]]'') or pardon the perpetrator instead; only ''diya'' is imposed for non-intentional harm.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009c}} Other criminal cases belong to the category of ''[[Tazir|ta\u02bfz\u012br]]'', where the goal of punishment is correction or rehabilitation of the culprit and its form is largely left to the judge's discretion.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009c}} In practice, since early on in Islamic history, criminal cases were usually handled by ruler-administered courts or local police using procedures which were only loosely related to sharia.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009c}}\n\nThe two major genres of ''fur\u016b\u02bf'' literature are the ''mukhtasar'' (concise summary of law) and the ''mabsut'' (extensive commentary).{{sfn|Calder|2009}}  ''Mukhtasars'' were short specialized treatises or general overviews that could be used in a classroom or consulted by judges.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=10-11}} A ''mabsut'', which usually provided a commentary on a ''mukhtasar'' and could stretch to dozens of large volumes, recorded alternative rulings with their justifications, often accompanied by a proliferation of cases and conceptual distinctions.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=10-11}} The terminology of juristic literature was conservative and tended to preserve notions which had lost their practical relevance.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} At the same time, the cycle of abridgement and commentary allowed jurists of each generation to articulate a modified body of law to meet changing social conditions.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=10-11}} Other juristic genres include the ''qaw\u0101\u02bfid'' (succinct

[[Nondenominational Muslim]] branches]]\n\nThe main Sunni schools of law (''madhhabs'') are the [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]] and [[Hanbali]] madhhabs.{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} They emerged in the ninth and tenth centuries and by the twelfth century almost all jurists aligned themselves with a particular madhhab.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} These four schools recognize each other's validity and they have interacted in legal debate over the centuries.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} Rulings of these schools are followed across the Muslim world without exclusive regional restrictions, but they each came to dominate in different parts of the world.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}  For example, the Maliki school is predominant in North and West Africa; the Hanafi school in South and Central Asia; the Shafi'i school in Lower Egypt, East Africa, and Southeast Asia; and the Hanbali school in North and Central Arabia.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} The first centuries of Islam also witnessed a number of short-lived Sunni madhhabs.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} The [[Zahiri]] school, which is commonly identified as extinct, continues to exert influence over legal thought.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} The development of Shia legal schools occurred along the lines of theological differences and resulted in formation of the [[Twelver]], [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] and [[Ismaili]] madhhabs, whose differences from Sunni legal schools are roughly of the same order as the differences among Sunni schools.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} The [[Ibadi]] legal school, distinct from Sunni and Shia madhhabs, is predominant in Oman.{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}\n\nThe transformations of Islamic legal institutions in the modern era have had profound implications for the madhhab system.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}}  Legal practice in most of the Muslim world has come to be controlled by government policy and state law, so that the influence of the madhhabs beyond personal ritual practice depends on the status accorded to them within the national legal system.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} State law codification commonly utilized the methods of ''takhayyur'' (selection of rulings without restriction to a particular madhhab) and ''talfiq'' (combining parts of different rulings on the same question).{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} Legal professionals trained in modern law schools have largely replaced traditional [[ulema]] as interpreters of the resulting laws.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} Global Islamic movements have at times drawn on different madhhabs and at other times placed greater focus on the scriptural sources rather than classical jurisprudence.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} The Hanbali school, with its particularly strict adherence to the Quran and hadith, has inspired conservative currents of direct scriptural interpretation by the [[Salafi]] and [[Wahhabi]] movements.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} Other currents, such as networks of Indonesian ulema and Islamic scholars residing in Muslim-minority countries, have advanced liberal interpretations of Islamic law without focusing on traditions of a particular madhhab.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}}\n\n==Pre-modern Islamic legal system==\n\n=== Jurists ===\n{{Main|Mufti|Madrasa}}\n\nSharia was traditionally interpreted by [[mufti]]s. During the first few centuries of Islam, muftis were private legal specialists who normally also held other jobs. They issued [[fatwa]]s (legal opinions), generally free of charge, in response to questions from laypersons or requests for consultation coming from judges, which would be stated in general terms. Fatwas were regularly upheld in courts, and when they were not, it was usually because the fatwa was contradicted by a more authoritative legal opinion.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=9-10,13}} The stature of jurists was determined by their scholarly reputation.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=9-10}}{{sfn|Stewart|2013|p=499}} The majority of classical legal works, written by author-jurists, were based in large part on fatwas of distinguished muftis.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=9-10}} These fatwas functioned as a form of legal [[precedent]], unlike court verdicts, which were valid only for the given case.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|p=180}} Although independent muftis never disappeared, from the 12th century onward Muslim rulers began to appoint salaried muftis to answer questions from the public.{{sfn|Stewart|2013|p=501}} Over the centuries, [[Sunni]] muftis were gradually incorporated into state bureaucracies, while [[Shia]] jurists in Iran progressively asserted an autonomous authority starting from the early modern era.{{sfn|Dallal|Hendrickson|2009}}\n\n[[File:Samarkand, Registan, Ulugbek Medressa (6238565020).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Ulugh Beg Madrasa, Samarkand]] (est. 1422)]]\nIslamic law was initially taught in study circles that gathered in mosques and private homes. The teacher, assisted by advanced students, provided commentary on concise treatises of law and examined the students' understanding of the text. This tradition continued to be practiced in ''[[madrasa]]s'', which spread during the 10th and 11th centuries.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=45-47}}{{sfn|Lapidus|2014|p=217}} Madrasas were institutions of higher learning devoted principally to study of law, but also offering other subjects such as theology, medicine, and mathematics. The madrasa complex usually consisted of a mosque, boarding house, and a library. It was maintained by a ''[[waqf]]'' (charitable endowment), which paid salaries of professors, stipends of students, and defrayed the costs of construction and maintenance. At the end of a course, the professor granted a license (''[[ijaza]]'') certifying a student's competence in its subject matter.{{sfn|Lapidus|2014|p=217}} Students specializing in law would complete a curriculum consisting of preparatory studies, the doctrines of a particular madhhab, and training in legal disputation, and finally write a dissertation, which earned them a license to teach and issue fatwas.{{sfn|Stewart|2013|p=501}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=45-47}}\n\n=== Courts ===\n\n{{Main|Qadi|Mazalim|Shurta|Muhtasib}}\nA judge ([[qadi]]) was in charge of the qadi's court (''mahkama''), also called the sharia court. Qadis were trained in Islamic law, though not necessarily to a level required to issue fatwas.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=11-12}} Court personnel also included a number of assistants performing various roles.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|p=158}} Judges were theoretically independent in their decisions, though they were appointed by the ruler and often experienced pressure from members of the ruling elite where their interests were at play.{{sfn|Stewart|2013|p=501}} The role of qadis was to evaluate the evidence, establish the facts of the case, and issue a verdict based on the applicable rulings of Islamic jurisprudence.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} The qadi was supposed to solicit a fatwa from a mufti if it was unclear how the law should be applied to the case.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009}} Since Islamic legal theory does not recognize the distinction between private and public law, court procedures were identical for civil and criminal cases, and required a private plaintiff to produce evidence against the defendant. The main type of evidence was oral witness testimony. The standards of evidence for criminal cases were so strict that a conviction was often difficult to obtain even for apparently clear-cut cases.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} Most historians believe that because of these stringent procedural norms, qadi's courts at an early date lost their jurisdiction over criminal cases, which were instead handled in other types of courts.{{sfn|Tillier|2014}}\n\nIf an accusation did not result in a verdict in a qadi's court, the plaintiff could often pursue it in another type of court called the ''[[mazalim]]'' court, administered by the ruler's council.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} The rationale for ''mazalim'' (lit. wrongs, grievances) courts was to address the wrongs that sharia courts were unable to address, including complaints against government officials. Islamic jurists were commonly in attendance and a judge often presided over the court as a deputy of the ruler.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Stewart|2013|p=501}} ''Mazalim'' verdicts were supposed to conform to the spirit of sharia, but they were not bound by the letter of the law or the procedural restrictions of qadi's courts.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009}}\n\nThe police (''[[shurta]]''), which took initiative in preventing and investigating crime, operated its own courts.{{sfn|Stewart|2013|p=501}} Like the mazalim courts, police courts were not bound by the rules of sharia and had the powers to inflict discretionary punishments.{{sfn|Tillier|2014}} Another office for maintaining public order was the ''[[muhtasib]]'' (market inspector), who was charged with preventing fraud in economic transactions and infractions against public morality.{{sfn|Stewart|2013|p=501}} The ''muhtasib'' took an active role in pursuing these types of offenses and meted out punishments based on [[Urf|local custom]].{{sfn|Tillier|2014}}\n\n=== Socio-political context ===\n\n[[File:'Abd Allah ibn Shaykh Murshid al-Katib - Sa'di and a Dervish Go to Settle their Quarrel Before a Judge - Walters W618106B - Cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The poet [[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]] and a [[dervish]] go to settle their quarrel before a judge (16th century Persian miniature)]]\nThe social fabric of pre-modern Islamic societies was largely defined by close-knit communities organized around kinship groups and local neighborhoods. Conflicts between individuals had the potential to escalate into a conflict between their supporting groups and disrupt the life of the entire community. Court litigation was seen as a last resort for cases where informal mediation had failed. This attitude was reflected in the legal maxim  \"amicable settlement is the best verdict\" (''al-sulh sayyid al-ahkam''). In court disputes, qadis were generally less concerned with legal theory than with achieving an outcome that enabled the disputants to resume their previous social relationships. This could be accomplished by avoiding a total loss for the losing side or simply giving them a chance to articulate their position in public and obtain a measure of psychological vindication.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=57-60}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009b|pp=159-162}} Islamic law required judges to be familiar with local customs, and they exercised a number of other public functions in the community, including mediation and arbitration, supervision of public works, auditing waqf finances, and looking after the interests of orphans.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=11-12}}{{sfn|Tillier|2014}}\n\nUnlike pre-modern cultures where the ruling dynasty promulgated the law, Islamic law was formulated by religious scholars without involvement of the rulers. The law derived its authority not from political control, but rather from the collective doctrinal positions of the legal schools (madhhabs) in their capacity as interpreters of the scriptures. The [[ulema]] (religious scholars) were involved in management of communal affairs and acted as representatives of the Muslim population vis-\u00e0-vis the ruling dynasties, who before the modern era had limited capacity for direct governance.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|pp=166-167}} Military elites relied on the ulema for religious legitimation, with financial support for religious institutions being one of the principal means through which these elites established their legitimacy.{{sfn|Berkey|2003|pp=225-226}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|pp=166-167}} In turn, the ulema depended on the support of the ruling elites for the continuing operation of religious institutions. Although the relationship between secular rulers and religious scholars underwent a number of shifts and transformations in different times and places, this mutual dependence characterized Islamic history until the start of the modern era.{{sfn|Hodgson|1974|pp=176\u2013177}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|pp=166-167}} Additionally, since sharia contained few provisions in several areas of public law, Muslim rulers were able to legislate various collections of economic, criminal and administrative laws outside the jurisdiction of Islamic jurists, the most famous of which is the ''[[Qanun (law)|qanun]]'' promulgated by Ottoman sultans beginning from the 15th century.{{sfn|Stewart|2013|p=500}} The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Aurangzeb]] (r. 1658-1707) issued a hybrid body of law known as [[Fatawa-e-Alamgiri]], based on [[Hanafi]] fatwas as well as decisions of Islamic courts, and made it applicable to all religious communities on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. This early attempt to turn Islamic law into semi-codified state legislation sparked rebellions against Mughal rule.{{sfn|Jones-Pauly|2009}}\n\n===Women, non-Muslims, slaves===\n\n{{Main|Women in Islam|Dhimmi|Islamic views on slavery|History of slavery in the Muslim world}}\nIn both the rules of civil disputes and application of penal law, classical sharia distinguishes between men and women, between Muslims and non-Muslims, and between free persons and slaves.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}\n\n[[File:Zibik.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|An unhappy wife complains to the kad\u0131 about her husband's impotence (18th century [[Ottoman miniature]])]]\nTraditional Islamic law assumes a patriarchal society with a man at the head of the household.{{sfn|Stewart|2013|p=502}} Different legal schools formulated a variety of legal norms which could be manipulated to the advantage of men or women,{{sfn|Lapidus|Salaymeh|2014|p=212}} but women were generally at a disadvantage with respect to the rules of inheritance, blood money (''diya''), and witness testimony, where a woman's value is effectively treated as half of that of a man.{{sfn|Stewart|2013|p=502}} In economic terms women enjoyed greater advantages under Islamic law than under other Mediterranean and Middle Eastern legal systems,{{sfn|Lapidus|Salaymeh|2014|p=212}} including the right to own personal property and dispose of it freely, which women in the West [[Timeline of women's legal rights (other than voting) in the 19th century|did not possess until \"quite recently\"]].{{sfn|Stewart|2013|p=502}} Various financial obligations imposed on the husband acted as a deterrent against [[Divorce in Islam#Talaq (repudiation)|unilateral divorce]] and commonly gave the wife financial leverage in divorce proceedings.{{sfn|Lapidus|Salaymeh|2014|p=212}} Women were active in sharia courts as both plaintiffs and defendants in a wide variety of cases, though some opted to be represented by a male relative.{{sfn|Lapidus|Salaymeh|2014|p=213}}{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}\n\nSharia was intended to regulate affairs of the Muslim community.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} Non-Muslims residing under Islamic rule had the legal status of [[dhimmi]], which entailed a number of protections, restrictions, freedoms and legal inequalities, including payment of the [[jizya]] tax.{{sfn|Nettler|2009}} Dhimmi communities had legal autonomy to adjudicate their internal affairs. Cases involving litigants from two different religious groups fell under jurisdiction of sharia courts,{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} where (unlike in secular courts){{sfn|Esposito|DeLong-Bas|2018|p=85}} testimony of non-Muslim witnesses against a Muslim was inadmissible in criminal cases{{sfn|Masters|2009}} or at all.{{sfn|Lapidus|2014|p=351}} This legal framework was implemented with varying degree of rigor. In some periods or towns, all inhabitants apparently used the same court without regard for their religious affiliation.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb imposed Islamic law on all his subjects, including provisions traditionally applicable only to Muslims, while some of his predecessors and successors are said to have abolished jizya.{{sfn|Jones-Pauly|2009}}{{sfn|Hardy|1991|p=566}}  According to Ottoman records, non-Muslim women took their cases to a sharia court when they expected a more favorable outcome on marital, divorce and property questions than in Christian and Jewish courts.{{sfn|Lapidus|Salaymeh|2014|p=360}}\n\nClassical fiqh acknowledges and regulates slavery as a legitimate institution.{{sfn|Stewart|2013|p=502}} It granted slaves certain rights and protections, improving their status relative to Greek and Roman law, and restricted the scenarios under which people could be enslaved.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=7}}{{sfn|El Achi|2018}} However, slaves could not inherit or enter into a contract, and were subject to their master's will in a number of ways.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=7}}{{sfn|El Achi|2018}} The labor and property of slaves were owned by the master, who was also entitled to sexual submission of his unmarried slaves.{{sfn|El Achi|2018}}{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=39}}\n\nFormal legal disabilities for some groups coexisted with a legal culture that viewed sharia as a reflection of universal principles of justice, which involved protection of the weak against injustices committed by the strong. This conception was reinforced by the historical practice of sharia courts, where peasants \"almost always\" won cases against oppressive landowners, and non-Muslims often prevailed in disputes against Muslims, including such powerful figures as the governor of their province.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|p=61}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009b|p=167}} In family matters the sharia court was seen as a place where the rights of women could be asserted against their husband's transgressions.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}\n\n==Modern legal reforms==\n\n===Under colonial rule===\n\nStarting from the 17th century, European powers began to extend political influence over lands ruled by Muslim dynasties, and by the end of the 19th century, much of the Muslim world came under colonial domination. The first areas of Islamic law to be impacted were usually commercial and criminal laws, which impeded colonial administration and were soon replaced by European regulations.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|p=174}} Islamic commercial laws were also replaced by European (mostly French) laws in Muslim states which retained formal independence, because these states increasingly came to rely on Western capital and could not afford to lose the business of foreign merchants who refused to submit to Islamic regulations.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}\n\n[[File:Warren Hastings.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Warren Hastings]] initiated far-reaching legal reforms in the British India]]\nThe first significant changes to the legal system of [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]] were initiated in the late 18th century by the governor of Bengal [[Warren Hastings]]. Hastings' plan of legal reform envisioned a multi-tiered court system for the Muslim population, with a middle tier of British judges advised by local Islamic jurists, and a lower tier of courts operated by qadis. Hastings also commissioned a translation of the classic manual of Hanafi fiqh, ''[[Al-Hidayah]]'', from Arabic into Persian and then English, later complemented by other texts.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|p=176-181}}{{sfn|Masud|2009}} These translations enabled British judges to pass verdicts in the name of Islamic law based on a combination of sharia rules and [[common law]] doctrines, and eliminated the need to rely on consultation by local ulema, whom they mistrusted. In the traditional Islamic context, a concise text like ''Al-Hidayah'' would be used as a basis for classroom commentary by a professor, and the doctrines thus learned would be mediated in court by judicial discretion, consideration of local customs and availability of different legal opinions that could fit the facts of the case. The British use of ''Al-Hidayah'', which amounted to an inadvertent codification of sharia, and its interpretation by judges trained in Western legal traditions anticipated later legal reforms in the Muslim world.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|p=176-181}}{{sfn|Stewart|2013|p=503}}\n\nBritish administrators felt that sharia rules too often allowed criminals to escape punishment, as exemplified by Hastings' complaint that Islamic law was \"founded on the most lenient principles and on an abhorrence of bloodshed\".{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|p=176-181}} In the course of the 19th century, criminal laws and other aspects of the Islamic legal system in India were supplanted by British law, with the exception of sharia rules retained in family laws and some property transactions.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|p=176-181}}{{sfn|Masud|2009}} Among other changes, these reforms brought about abolition of slavery, prohibition of child marriage, and a much more frequent use of capital punishment.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009b|p=378}}{{sfn|Masud|2009}}  The resulting legal system, known as ''Anglo-Muhammadan law'', was treated by the British as a model for legal reforms in their other colonies. Like the British in India, colonial administrations typically sought to obtain precise and authoritative information about indigenous laws, which prompted them to prefer classical Islamic legal texts over local judicial practice. This, together with their conception of Islamic law as a collection of inflexible rules, led to an emphasis on traditionalist forms of sharia that were not rigorously applied in the pre-colonial period and served as a formative influence on the modern identity politics of the Muslim world.{{sfn|Masud|2009}}\n\n===Ottoman empire===\n\n[[File:1879-Ottoman Court-from-NYL.png|thumb|upright=1.8|An Ottoman courtroom (1879 drawing)]]\nDuring the colonial era, Muslim rulers concluded that they could not resist European pressure unless they modernized their armies and built centrally administered states along the lines of Western models. In the [[Ottoman empire]], the first such changes in the legal sphere involved placing the formerly independent [[waqf]]s under state control. This reform, passed in 1826, enriched the public treasury at the expense of the waqfs, thereby depleting the financial support for traditional Islamic legal education. Over the second half of the 19th century, a new hierarchical system of secular courts was established to supplement and eventually replace most religious courts. Students hoping to pursue legal careers in the new court system increasingly preferred attending secular schools over the traditional path of legal education with its dimming financial prospects.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|pp=174-176}} The [[Tanzimat]] reforms of the 19th century saw reorganization of both Islamic civil law and sultanic criminal law after the model of the [[Napoleonic Code]].{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}  In the 1870s, a codification of civil law and procedure (excepting marriage and divorce), called the ''[[Mecelle]]'', was produced for use in both sharia and secular courts. It adopted the Turkish language for the benefit of the new legal class who no longer possessed competence in the Arabic idiom of traditional jurisprudence. The code was based on Hanafi law, and its authors selected minority opinions over authoritative ones when they were felt to better \"suit the present conditions\". The Mecelle was promulgated as a ''[[qanun (law)|qanun]]'' (sultanic code), which represented an unprecedented assertion of the state's authority over Islamic civil law, traditionally the preserve of the ulema.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|pp=174-176}} The 1917 [[Ottoman family law|Ottoman Law of Family Rights]] adopted an innovative approach of drawing rules from minority and majority opinions of all Sunni madhhabs with a modernizing intent.{{sfn|Mayer|2009}} The [[Republic of Turkey]], which emerged after the [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]], abolished its sharia courts and replaced Ottoman civil laws with the [[Swiss Civil Code]],{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} but Ottoman civil laws remained in force for several decades in Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, and Iraq.{{sfn|Mayer|2009}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}\n\n===Nation states===\n\n[[File:Mahkamah Syariyah Aceh.jpg|thumb|''Mahkamah Syariyah'' (sharia court) in [[Aceh]], [[Indonesia]]]]\nWesternization of legal institutions and expansion of state control in all areas of law, which began during the colonial era, continued in nation-states of the Muslim world.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|pp=182-183}} Sharia courts at first continued to exist alongside state courts as in earlier times, but the doctrine that sultanic courts should implement the ideals of sharia was gradually replaced by legal norms imported from Europe. Court procedures were also brought in line with European practice. Though the Islamic terms ''qadi'' and ''mahkama'' (qadi's/sharia court) were preserved, they generally came to mean judge and court in the Western sense. While in the traditional sharia court all parties represented themselves, in modern courts they are represented by professional lawyers educated in Western-style law schools, and the verdicts are subject to review in an appeals court. In the 20th century, most countries abolished a parallel system of sharia courts and brought all cases under a national civil court system.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}\n\nIn most Muslim-majority countries, traditional rules of classical fiqh have been largely preserved only in family law. In some countries religious minorities such as Christians or Shia Muslims have been subject to separate systems of family laws.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} Many Muslims today believe that contemporary sharia-based laws are an authentic representation of the pre-modern legal tradition. In reality, they generally represent the result of extensive legal reforms made in the modern era.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|pp=182-183}} As traditional Islamic jurists lost their role as authoritative interpreters of the laws applied in courts, these laws were codified by legislators and administered by state systems which employed a number of devices to effect changes,{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} including:\n\n* Selection of alternative opinions from traditional legal literature (''takhayyur''), potentially among  multiple madhhabs or denominations, and combining parts of different rulings (''talfiq'').{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|pp=182-183}}{{sfn|Schacht|Layish|2000|p=155}}\n* Appeal to the classical doctrines of necessity (''darura''), public interest (''maslaha''), and the objectives (''maqasid'') of sharia, which played a limited role in classical fiqh, but were now given wider utilitarian applications.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|pp=182-183}}{{sfn|Schacht|Layish|2000|p=155}}{{sfn|Stewart|2013|p=503}}\n* Changes in administrative law that grant the courts discretionary powers to restrict certain practices which are not forbidden by substantive law (e.g., polygamy), in some cases imposing penal sanctions as additional deterrence.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|pp=182-183}}{{sfn|Schacht|Layish|2000|p=155}}\n* Modernist interpretation of Islamic scriptures without adherence to the rules or methodologies of traditional jurisprudence, known as ''neo-ijtihad''.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|pp=182-183}}{{sfn|Schacht|Layish|2000|p=155}}\n\n[[File:The Late Grand Moufti (1906) - TIMEA.jpg|thumbnail|upright=0.7|[[Muhammad Abduh]] exercised a powerful influence on liberal reformist thought]]\nThe most powerful influence on liberal reformist thought came from the work of the Egyptian Islamic scholar [[Muhammad Abduh|Muhammad \u02bfAbduh]] (1849\u20131905). Abduh viewed only sharia rules pertaining to religious rituals as inflexible, and argued that the other Islamic laws should be adapted based on changing circumstances in consideration of social well-being. Following precedents of earlier Islamic thinkers, he advocated restoring Islam to its original purity by  returning to the Quran and the sunna instead of following the medieval schools of jurisprudence.{{sfn|Mayer|2009}} He championed a creative approach to ijtihad that involved direct interpretation of scriptures as well as the methods of ''takhayyur'' and ''talfiq''.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Mayer|2009}}\n\nOne of the most influential figures in modern legal reforms was the Egyptian legal scholar [[Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri]] (1895\u20131971), who possessed expertise in both Islamic and Western law. Sanhuri argued that reviving Islamic legal heritage in a way that served the needs of contemporary society required its analysis in light of the modern science of [[comparative law]]. He drafted the civil codes of Egypt (1949) and Iraq (1951) based on a variety of sources, including classical fiqh, European laws, existing Arab and Turkish codes, and the history of local court decisions.{{sfn|Mayer|2009}}{{sfn|Jones-Pauly|2009}} Sanhuri's Egyptian code incorporated few classical sharia rules, but he drew on traditional jurisprudence more frequently for the Iraqi code.{{sfn|Jones-Pauly|2009}} Sanhuri's codes were subsequently adopted in some form by most Arab countries.{{sfn|Mayer|2009}}\n\nAside from the radical reforms of Islamic family law carried out in Tunisia (1956) and Iran (1967), governments often preferred to make changes that made a clear break from traditional sharia rules by imposing administrative hurdles rather than changing the rules themselves, in order to minimize objections from religious conservatives. Various procedural changes have been made in a number of countries to restrict polygamy, give women greater rights in divorce, and eliminate child marriage. Inheritance has been the legal domain least susceptible to reform, as legislators have been generally reluctant to tamper with the highly technical system of [[Islamic inheritance jurisprudence|Quranic shares]].{{sfn|Mayer|2009}}{{sfn|Jones-Pauly|2009}} Some reforms have faced strong conservative opposition. For example, the 1979 reform of Egyptian family law, promulgated by [[Anwar Sadat]] through presidential decree, provoked an outcry and was annulled in 1985 by the supreme court on procedural grounds, to be later replaced by a compromise version.{{sfn|Mayer|2009}} The [[Mudawana|2003 reform of Moroccan family law]], which sought to reconcile universal human rights norms and the country's Islamic heritage, was drafted by a commission that included parliamentarians, religious scholars and feminist activists, and the result has been praised by international rights groups as an example of progressive legislation achieved within an Islamic framework.{{sfn|Rabb|2009d}}{{sfn|Mayer|2009}}\n\n===Islamization===\n\n{{Islamism sidebar|Concepts}}\n{{Main|Islamization}}\nThe [[Islamic revival]] of the late 20th century brought the topic of sharia to international attention in the form of numerous political campaigns in the Muslim world calling for full implementation of sharia.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Stewart|2013|pp=503-504}}  A number of factors have contributed to the rise of these movements, classified under the rubric of [[Islamism]] or [[political Islam]], including the failure of authoritarian secular regimes to meet the expectations of their citizens, and a desire of Muslim populations to return to more culturally authentic forms of socio-political organization in the face of a perceived cultural invasion from the West.{{sfn|Stewart|2013|pp=503-504}}{{sfn|Lapidus|2014|p=835}} Islamist leaders such as [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] drew on leftist anticolonialist rhetoric by framing their call for sharia as a resistance struggle. They accused secular leaders of corruption and predatory behavior, and claimed that a return to sharia would replace despotic rulers with pious leaders striving for social and economic justice. In the [[Arab world]] these positions are often encapsulated in the slogan \"Islam is the solution\" (''al-Islam huwa al-hall'').{{sfn|Stewart|2013|pp=503-504}}\n\nFull implementation of sharia theoretically refers to expanding its scope to all fields of law and all areas of public life.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} In practice, Islamization campaigns have focused on a few highly visible issues associated with the conservative Muslim identity, particularly women's [[hijab]] and the ''hudud'' criminal punishments (whipping, stoning and amputation) prescribed for certain crimes.{{sfn|Stewart|2013|pp=503-504}}  For many Islamists, ''hudud'' punishments are at the core of the divine sharia because they are specified by the letter of scripture rather than by human interpreters. Modern Islamists have often rejected, at least in theory, the stringent procedural constraints developed by classical jurists to restrict their application.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} To the broader Muslim public, the calls for sharia often represent, even more than any specific demands, a vague vision of their current economic and political situation being replaced by a \"just utopia\".{{sfn|Lapidus|2014|p=835}}\n\nA number of legal reforms have been made under the influence of these movements, starting from the 1970s when Egypt and Syria amended their constitutions to specify sharia as the basis of legislation.{{sfn|Stewart|2013|pp=503-504}} The [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979 represented a watershed for Islamization advocates, demonstrating that it was possible to replace a secular regime with a theocracy.{{sfn|Stewart|2013|pp=503-504}} Several countries, including Iran, Pakistan, Sudan, and some Nigerian states have incorporated hudud rules into their criminal justice systems, which, however, retained fundamental influences of earlier Westernizing reforms.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Mayer|2009}} In practice, these changes were largely symbolic, and aside from some cases brought to trial to demonstrate that the new rules were being enforced, hudud punishments tended to fall into disuse, sometimes to be revived depending on the local political climate.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Otto|2008|p=20}} The supreme courts of Sudan and Iran have rarely approved verdicts of stoning or amputation, and the supreme courts of Pakistan and Nigeria have never done so.{{sfn|Otto|2008|p=20}} Nonetheless, Islamization campaigns have also had repercussions in several other areas of law, leading to curtailment of rights of women and religious minorities, and in the case of Sudan contributing to the breakout of a civil war.{{sfn|Mayer|2009}}\n\nAdvocates of Islamization have often been more concerned with ideology than traditional jurisprudence and there is no agreement among them as to what form a modern sharia-based \"[[Islamic state]]\" should take. This is particularly the case for the theorists of [[Islamic economics]] and [[Islamic finance]], who have advocated both free-market and socialist economic models.{{sfn|Mayer|2009}} The notion of \"sharia-compliant\" finance has become an active area of doctrinal innovation and its development has had a major impact on business operations around the world.{{sfn|Stewart|2013|pp=503-504}}\n\n==Role in contemporary Islam==\n\n===In state laws===\n\n{{main|Application of sharia law by country}}\n[[File:Use of Sharia by country.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|Use of sharia by country:<br />\n{{legend|#179C86|Sharia plays no role in the judicial system.}}\n{{legend|#F6DD4F|Sharia influences personal status (family) laws.}}\n{{legend|#706EA4|Sharia influences personal status and criminal laws.}}\n{{legend|#FF9950|Regional variations in the application of sharia.}}\n]]\n\n====Types of legal systems====\n\nThe legal systems of most Muslim-majority countries can be classified as either secular or mixed. Sharia plays no role in secular legal systems. In mixed legal systems, sharia rules are allowed to influence some national laws, which are codified and may be based on European or Indian models, and the central legislative role is played by politicians and modern jurists rather than the [[ulema]] (traditional Islamic scholars). Saudi Arabia and some other Gulf states possess what may be called classical sharia systems, where national law is largely uncodified and formally equated with sharia, with ulema playing a decisive role in its interpretation. Iran has adopted some features of classical sharia systems, while also maintaining characteristics of mixed systems, like codified laws and a parliament.{{sfn|Otto|2008|pp=8-9}}\n\n====Constitutional law====\n\nConstitutions of many Muslim-majority countries refer to sharia as a source or the main source of law, though these references are not in themselves indicative of how much the legal system is influenced by sharia, and whether the influence has a traditionalist or modernist character.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Calder|2009}} The same constitutions usually also refer to universal principles such as democracy and human rights, leaving it up to legislators and the judiciary to work out how these norms are to be reconciled in practice.{{sfn|Otto|2008|pp=18-19}} Conversely, some countries (e.g., Algeria), whose constitution does not mention sharia, possess sharia-based family laws.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} Nisrine Abiad identifies Bahrain, Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia as states with \"strong constitutional consequences\" of sharia \"on the organization and functioning of power\".{{sfn|Abiad|2008|pp=38-42}}\n\n====Family law====\n\nExcept for secular systems, Muslim-majority countries possess sharia-based laws dealing with family matters (marriage, inheritance, etc.). These laws generally reflect influence of various modern-era reforms and tend to be characterized by ambiguity, with traditional and modernist interpretations often manifesting themselves in the same country, both in legislation and court decisions.{{sfn|Otto|2008|p=19}} In some countries (e.g., parts of Nigeria and Greece), people can choose whether to pursue a case in a sharia or secular court.{{sfn|Otto|2008|p=19}}<ref>{{cite news|title=Greece Scraps Compulsory Shariah for Muslim Minority|author=Niki Kitsantonis|newspaper=The New York Times|date=Jan 10, 2018|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/world/europe/greece-shariah-law.html|access-date=16 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416212547/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/world/europe/greece-shariah-law.html|archive-date=16 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Criminal law====\n\nCountries in the Muslim world generally have criminal codes influenced by French law or common law, and in some cases a combination of Western legal traditions. Saudi Arabia has never adopted a criminal code and Saudi judges still follow traditional Hanbali jurisprudence. In the course of Islamization campaigns, several countries (Libya, Pakistan, Iran, Sudan, Mauritania, and Yemen) inserted Islamic criminal laws into their penal codes, which were otherwise based on Western models. In some countries only ''hudud'' penalties were added, while others also enacted provisions for ''[[qisas]]'' (law of retaliation) and ''[[Diya (Islam)|diya]]'' (monetary compensation). Iran subsequently issued a new \"Islamic Penal Code\". The criminal codes of Afghanistan and United Arab Emirates contain a general provision that certain crimes are to be punished according to Islamic law, without specifying the penalties. Some Nigerian states have also enacted Islamic criminal laws. [[Islamic criminal law in Aceh|Laws in the Indonesian province of Aceh]] provide for application of discretionary (''[[ta'zir]]'') punishments for violation of Islamic norms, but explicitly exclude ''hudud'' and ''qisas''.{{sfn|Tellenbach|2015|pp=249-250}} [[Brunei]] has been implementing a \"Sharia Penal Code\", which includes provisions for stoning and amputation, in stages since 2014.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=New York Times|author=Austin Ramzy|title=Brunei to Punish Adultery and Gay Sex With Death by Stoning|date=March 28, 2019|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/world/asia/brunei-adultery-gay-stoning.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Brunei Shariah law applies death sentence for homosexuality|newspaper=Deutsche Welle|date=March 27, 2019|url=https://www.dw.com/en/brunei-shariah-law-applies-death-sentence-for-homosexuality/a-48076114|access-date=27 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331093514/https://www.dw.com/en/brunei-shariah-law-applies-death-sentence-for-homosexuality/a-48076114|archive-date=31 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The countries where ''hudud'' penalties are legal do not use stoning and amputation routinely, and generally apply other punishments instead.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Otto|2008|p=20}}{{sfn|Brown|2017}}\n\n====Muslim-minority countries====\n\nSharia also plays a role beyond religious rituals and personal ethics in some countries with Muslim minorities.

However, after the proclamation was presented as a fatwa in Western press, this characterization was widely accepted by both its critics and its supporters.{{sfn|Hendrickson|2013}}{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2005|p=142}}}} Together with later militant fatwas, it has contributed to the popular misconception of the fatwa as a religious death warrant.{{sfn|Berger|2014}}\n\nModern fatwas have been marked by an increased reliance on the process of ''[[ijtihad]]'', i.e. deriving legal rulings based on an independent analysis rather than conformity with the opinions of earlier legal authorities (''[[taqlid]]''),{{sfn|Berger|2014}} and some of them are issued by individuals who do not possess the qualifications traditionally required of a mufti.{{sfn|Dallal|Hendrickson|2009}} The most notorious examples are the fatwas of [[Islamic extremism|militant extremists]].{{sfn|Berger|2014}} When [[Osama Bin Laden]] and his associates issued a fatwa in 1998 proclaiming \"jihad against Jews and Crusaders\", many Islamic jurists, in addition to denouncing its content, stressed that bin Laden was not qualified to either issue a fatwa or proclaim a jihad.{{sfn|Dallal|Hendrickson|2009}} New forms of ijtihad have also given rise to fatwas that support such notions as gender equality and banking interest, which are at variance with classical jurisprudence.{{sfn|Berger|2014}}\n\nIn the internet age, a large number of websites provide fatwas in response to queries from around the world, in addition to radio shows and satellite television programs offering call-in fatwas.{{sfn|Dallal|Hendrickson|2009}} Erroneous and sometimes bizarre fatwas issued by unqualified or eccentric individuals in recent times have sometimes given rise to complaints about a \"chaos\" in the modern practice of issuing fatwas.{{sfn|Messick|2017}} There exists no international Islamic authority to settle differences in interpretation of Islamic law. An [[International Islamic Fiqh Academy, Jeddah|International Islamic Fiqh Academy]] was created by the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], but its legal opinions are not binding.{{sfn|Masud|K\u00e9chichian|2009}} The vast amount of fatwas produced in the modern world attests to the importance of Islamic authenticity to many Muslims. However, there is little research available to indicate to what extent Muslims acknowledge the authority of different muftis or heed their rulings in real life.{{sfn|Berger|2014}}\n\n===Role of ''hisba''===\n\n{{Main|Hisbah}}\n{{Further|Islamic religious police}}\n\nThe classical doctrine of ''[[Hisbah|hisba]]'', associated with the Quranic injunction of ''[[enjoining good and forbidding wrong]]'', refers to the duty of Muslims to promote moral rectitude and intervene when another Muslim is acting wrongly.{{sfn|Thielmann|2017}}{{sfn|Mack|2018}} Historically, its legal implementation was entrusted to a public official called ''[[muhtasib]]'' (market inspector), who was charged with preventing fraud, disturbance of public order and infractions against public morality. This office disappeared in the modern era everywhere in the Muslim world, but it was revived in Arabia by the first Saudi state, and later instituted as a [[Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Saudi Arabia)|government committee]] responsible for supervising markets and public order.

This perspective, which stresses comprehensive implementation of sharia, was widespread in the 1970s and 1980s among various movements seeking to establish an Islamic state, but its popularity has diminished in recent years.\n* The moderate Islamic view stresses the concepts of ''[[maslaha]]'' (public interest), ''[[Adl|\u02bfadl]]'' (justice), and ''shura''. Islamic leaders are considered to uphold justice if they promote public interest, as defined through ''shura''. In this view, ''shura'' provides the basis for representative government institutions that are similar to Western democracy, but reflect Islamic rather than Western liberal values. [[Hasan al-Turabi]], [[Rashid al-Ghannushi]], and [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] have advocated different forms of this view.\n* The liberal Islamic view is influenced by [[Muhammad Abduh]]'s emphasis on the role of reason in understanding religion. It stresses democratic principles based on pluralism and freedom of thought. Authors like [[Fahmi Huwaidi]] and [[Tariq al-Bishri]] have constructed Islamic justifications for full citizenship of non-Muslims in an Islamic state by drawing on early Islamic texts. Others, like [[Mohammed Arkoun]] and [[Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd]], have justified pluralism and freedom through non-literalist approaches to textual interpretation. [[Abdolkarim Soroush]] has argued for a \"religious democracy\" based on religious thought that is democratic, tolerant, and just. Islamic liberals argue for the necessity of constant reexamination of religious understanding, which can only be done in a democratic context.\n\n====European Court of Human Rights====\n\nIn 1998 the [[Constitutional Court of Turkey]] banned and dissolved Turkey's [[Welfare Party|Refah Party]] over its announced intention to introduce sharia-based laws, ruling that it would change Turkey's secular order and undermine democracy.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kevin Boyle|title=Human Rights, Religion and Democracy: The Refah Party Case|journal=Essex Human Rights Review|year=2004|volume=1|number=1|page=2|url=http://projects.essex.ac.uk/EHRR/V1N1/Boyle.pdf|access-date=16 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180421043912/http://projects.essex.ac.uk/ehrr/V1N1/Boyle.pdf|archive-date=21 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> On appeal by Refah the [[European Court of Human Rights]] determined that \"sharia is incompatible with the fundamental principles of democracy\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icnl.org/research/journal/vol6iss1/special_5.htm |title=Refah Partisi (The Welfare Party) and Others v.

Marriage below the age of competence was permissible only if proof of sexual maturity was accepted in court, while marriage under the minimum age was forbidden. During the 20th century,  most countries in the Middle East followed the Ottoman precedent in defining the age of competence, while raising the minimum age to 15 or 16 for boys and 13-16 for girls. Marriage below the age of competence is subject to approval by a judge and the legal guardian of the adolescent. Egypt diverged from this pattern by setting the age limits of 18 for boys and 16 for girls, without a distinction between competence for marriage and minimum age.<ref name=EI2-8-29>{{Cite encyclopedia|author1=Schacht, J.|author2= Layish, A.|author3= Shaham, R.|author4= Ansari, Ghaus|author5= Otto, J.M.|author6= Pompe, S.|author7= Knappert, J. |author8=Boyd, Jean| year=1995 | title=Nik\u0101\u1e25|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editor1=P.

studies#Sanad and matn|chains of transmission]] of the hadith back to Muhammad's companions.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} In his view, the real architect of Islamic jurisprudence was [[Al-Shafi\u2018i]] (d. 820 CE/204 AH), who formulated this idea (that legal norms must be formally grounded in scriptural sources) and other elements of classical legal theory in his work ''[[Al-Risala (Al-Shafi\u2018i)|al-risala]]'',{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Jokisch|2015}} but who was preceded by a body of Islamic law not based on primacy of Muhammad's hadiths.\n\nWhile the origin of hadith remains a subject of scholarly controversy, this theory (of Goldziher and Schacht) has given rise to objections, and modern historians generally adopt more cautious, intermediate positions,{{sfn|Jokisch|2015}}  \nand it is generally accepted that early Islamic jurisprudence developed out of a combination of administrative and popular practices shaped by the religious and ethical precepts of Islam.{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}}{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} It continued some aspects of pre-Islamic laws and customs of the lands that fell under Muslim rule in the aftermath of the [[Early Muslim conquests|early conquests]] and modified other aspects, aiming to meet the practical need of establishing Islamic norms of behavior and adjudicating disputes arising in the early Muslim communities.{{sfn|Lapidus|2014|p=125}} Juristic thought gradually developed in study circles, where independent scholars met to learn from a local master and discuss religious topics.{{sfn|Lapidus|2014|p=125}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=31\u201335}} At first, these circles were fluid in their membership, but with time distinct regional legal schools crystallized around shared sets of methodological principles.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=31\u201335}}{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} As the boundaries of the schools became clearly delineated, the authority of their doctrinal tenets came to be vested in a master jurist from earlier times, who was henceforth identified as the school's founder.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=31\u201335}}{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} In the course of the first three centuries of Islam, all legal schools came to accept the broad outlines of classical legal theory, according to which Islamic law had to be firmly rooted in the Quran and hadith.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Lapidus|2014|p=130}}\n\n== Traditional jurisprudence (''fiqh'') ==\n\n{{Main|Fiqh}}\nFiqh is traditionally divided into the fields of ''[[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|u\u1e63\u016bl al-fiqh]]'' (lit. the roots of fiqh), which studies the theoretical principles of jurisprudence, and ''fur\u016b\u02bf al-fiqh'' (lit. the branches of fiqh), which is devoted to elaboration of rulings on the basis of these principles.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Schneider|2014}}\n\n=== Principles of jurisprudence (''u\u1e63\u016bl al-fiqh'') ===\n\n{{Main|Principles of Islamic jurisprudence}}\nClassical jurists held that human reason is a gift from God which should be exercised to its fullest capacity.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|p=15}} However, they believed that use of reason alone is insufficient to distinguish right from wrong, and that rational argumentation must draw its content from the body of transcendental knowledge revealed in the Quran and through the sunnah of Muhammad.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|p=15}}\n\nTraditional theory of Islamic jurisprudence elaborates how scriptures should be interpreted from the standpoint of linguistics and rhetoric.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} It also comprises methods for establishing authenticity of hadith and for determining when the legal force of a scriptural passage is [[Naskh (tafsir)|abrogated]] by a passage revealed at a later date.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} In addition to the Quran and sunnah, the classical theory of Sunni fiqh recognizes two other sources of law: juristic consensus (''[[Ijma|ijma\u02bf]]'') and analogical reasoning (''[[qiyas]]'').{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}} It therefore studies the application and limits of analogy, as well as the value and limits of consensus, along with other methodological principles, some of which are accepted by only certain legal schools.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} This interpretive apparatus is brought together under the rubric of [[ijtihad]], which refers to a jurist's exertion in an attempt to arrive at a ruling on a particular question.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} The theory of [[Twelver Shia]] jurisprudence parallels that of Sunni schools with some differences, such as recognition of reason (''[['Aql|\u02bfaql]]'') as a source of law in place of ''qiyas'' and extension of the notion of sunnah to include traditions of the [[The Twelve Imams|imams]].{{sfn|Kamali|1999|pp=121\u201322}}\n\n==== Sources of sharia ====\n\n{{Main|Sources of sharia}}\n* ''[[Quran]]'': In Islam, the Quran is considered to be the most sacred source of law.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16\u201318}} Classical jurists held its textual integrity to be beyond doubt on account of it having been handed down by many people in each generation, which is known as \"recurrence\" or \"concurrent transmission\" (''taw\u0101tur'').{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16\u201318}} Only several hundred verses of the Quran have direct legal relevance, and they are concentrated in a few specific areas such as inheritance, though other passages have been used as a source for general principles whose legal ramifications were elaborated by other means.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16\u201318}}\n* ''[[Hadith]]'': The body of hadith provides more detailed and practical legal guidance, but it was recognized early on that not all of them were authentic.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16\u201318}} Early Islamic scholars developed a methodology for evaluating their authenticity by assessing trustworthiness of the individuals listed in their transmission chains.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16\u201318}} These criteria narrowed down the vast corpus of prophetic traditions to several thousand \"sound\" hadiths, which were collected in several canonical compilations.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16\u201318}} The hadiths which enjoyed concurrent transmission were deemed unquestionably authentic; however, the vast majority of hadiths were handed down by only one or a few transmitters and were therefore seen to yield only probable knowledge.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16-18}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}} The uncertainty was further compounded by ambiguity of the language contained in some hadiths and Quranic passages.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16\u201318}} Disagreements on the relative merits and interpretation of the textual sources allowed legal scholars considerable leeway in formulating alternative rulings.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}\n* ''Consensus ([[ijma]])'' could in principle elevate a ruling based on probable evidence to absolute certainty.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=21\u201322}}{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} This classical doctrine drew its authority from a series of hadiths stating that the Islamic community could never agree on an error.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=21\u201322}} This form of consensus was technically defined as agreement of all competent jurists in any particular generation, acting as representatives of the community.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=21\u201322}}{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Kamali|1999|p=146}} However, the practical difficulty of obtaining and ascertaining such an agreement meant that it had little impact on legal development.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=21\u201322}}{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} A more pragmatic form of consensus, which could be determined by consulting works of prominent jurists, was used to confirm a ruling so that it could not be reopened for further discussion.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} The cases for which there was a consensus account for less than 1 percent of the body of classical jurisprudence.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=21\u201322}}\n* ''Analogical reasoning ([[qiyas]])'': Qiyas is used to derive a ruling for a situation not addressed in the scripture by analogy with a scripturally based rule.{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}} In a classic example, the Quranic prohibition of drinking wine is extended to all intoxicating substances, on the basis of the \"cause\"  (''\u02bfilla'') shared by these situations, which in this case is identified to be intoxication.{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}} Since the cause of a rule may not be apparent, its selection commonly occasioned controversy and extensive debate.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=23\u201324}} Twelver Shia jurisprudence does not recognize the use of qiyas, but relies on reason (''\u02bfaql'') in its place.{{sfn|Schneider|2014}}\n\n==== Ijtihad ====\n\n{{Main|Ijtihad}}\n[[File:T\u00fcrkischer Mufti.jpg|thumb|Turkish mufti (17th-century Spanish drawing)]]\nThe classical process of ijtihad combined these generally recognized principles with other methods, which were not adopted by all legal schools, such as ''[[istihsan]]'' (juristic preference), ''[[istislah]]'' (consideration of public interest) and ''[[istishab]]'' (presumption of continuity).{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}} A jurist who is qualified to practice ijtihad is known as a ''mujtahid''.{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} The use of independent reasoning to arrive at a ruling is contrasted with ''[[taqlid]]'' (imitation), which refers to following the rulings of a mujtahid.{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} By the beginning of the 10th century, development of Sunni jurisprudence prompted leading jurists to state that the main legal questions had been addressed and the scope of ijtihad was gradually restricted.{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009c}} From the 18th century on, leading Muslim reformers began calling for abandonment of taqlid and renewed emphasis on ijtihad, which they saw as a return to the vitality of early Islamic jurisprudence.{{sfn|Rabb|2009c}}\n\n==== Decision types (''a\u1e25k\u0101m'') ====\n\n{{Main|Ahkam}}\nFiqh is concerned with ethical standards as much as with legal norms, seeking to establish not only what is and is not legal, but also what is morally right and wrong.{{sfn|Coulson|El Shamsy|2019}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|p=145}} Sharia rulings fall into one of five categories known as \u201cthe five decisions\u201d (''al-a\u1e25k\u0101m al-khamsa''): [[Fard|mandatory]] (''far\u1e0d'' or ''w\u0101jib''), [[Mustahabb|recommended]] (''mand\u016bb'' or ''musta\u1e25abb''), [[Mubah|neutral]] (''mub\u0101\u1e25''), [[Makruh|reprehensible]] (''makr\u016bh''), and [[Haram|forbidden]] (''\u1e25ar\u0101m'').{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Schneider|2014}} It is a sin or a crime to perform a forbidden action or not to perform a mandatory action.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} Reprehensible acts should be avoided, but they are not considered to be sinful or punishable in court.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|p=20}} Avoiding reprehensible acts and performing recommended acts is held to be subject of reward in the afterlife, while neutral actions entail no judgement from God.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|p=20}} Jurists disagree on whether the term ''[[Halal|\u1e25al\u0101l]]'' covers the first three or the first four categories.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} The legal and moral verdict depends on whether the action is committed out of necessity (''\u1e0dar\u016bra'') and on the underlying intention (''[[niyya]]''), as expressed in the legal maxim \"acts are [evaluated according] to intention.\"{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}\n\n==== Aims of sharia and public interest ====\n\n{{Main|Maqasid|Maslaha}}\n''Maq\u0101\u1e63id'' (aims or purposes) of sharia  and ''ma\u1e63la\u1e25a'' (welfare or public interest) are two related classical doctrines which have come to play an increasingly prominent role in modern times.{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2\u20136}}{{sfn|Brown|2009}}{{sfn|Gleave|2012}} They were first clearly articulated by [[al-Ghazali]] (d. 1111), who argued that ''maslaha'' was God's general purpose in revealing the divine law, and that its specific aim was preservation of five essentials of human well-being: religion, life, intellect, offspring, and property.{{sfn|Opwis|2007|p=65}} Although most classical-era jurists recognized ''maslaha'' and ''maqasid'' as important legal principles, they held different views regarding the role they should play in Islamic law.{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2\u20136}}{{sfn|Gleave|2012}} Some jurists viewed them as auxiliary rationales constrained by scriptural sources and analogical reasoning.{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2\u20136}}{{sfn|Opwis|2007|pp=66\u201368}} Others regarded them as an independent source of law, whose general principles could override specific inferences based on the letter of scripture.{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2\u20136}}{{sfn|Opwis|2007|pp=68\u201369}} While the latter view was held by a minority of classical jurists, in modern times it came to be championed in different forms by prominent scholars who sought to adapt Islamic law to changing social conditions by drawing on the intellectual heritage of traditional jurisprudence.{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2\u20136}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}}{{sfn|Brown|2009}} These scholars expanded the inventory of ''maqasid'' to include such aims of sharia as reform and women's rights ([[Rashid Rida]]); justice and freedom ([[Mohammed al-Ghazali]]); and human dignity and rights ([[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]]).{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2\u20136}}\n\n===Branches of law===\n\n{{Fiqh}}\n{{Further|Topics of sharia law}}\nThe domain of ''fur\u016b\u02bf al-fiqh'' (lit. branches of fiqh) is traditionally divided into ''\u02bfib\u0101d\u0101t'' (rituals or acts of worship) and ''mu\u02bf\u0101mal\u0101t'' (social relations).{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} Many jurists further divided the body of substantive jurisprudence into \"the four quarters\", called rituals, sales, marriage and injuries.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=28-30}} Each of these terms figuratively stood for a variety of subjects.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=28-30}} For example, the quarter of sales would encompass partnerships, guaranty, gifts, and bequests, among other topics.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=28-30}} Juristic works were arranged as a sequence of such smaller topics, each called a \"book\" (''kitab'').{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=28-30}} The special significance of ritual was marked by always placing its discussion at the start of the work.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=28-30}}\n\nSome historians distinguish a field of Islamic criminal law, which combines several traditional categories.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009c}}{{sfn|Schneider|2014}} Several crimes with scripturally prescribed punishments are known as ''[[hudud]]''.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} Jurists developed various restrictions which in many cases made them virtually impossible to apply.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} Other crimes involving intentional bodily harm are judged according to a version of ''[[lex talionis]]'' that prescribes a punishment analogous to the crime (''[[qisas]]''), but the victims or their heirs may accept a monetary compensation (''[[Diya (Islam)|diya]]'') or pardon the perpetrator instead; only ''diya'' is imposed for non-intentional harm.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009c}} Other criminal cases belong to the category of ''[[Tazir|ta\u02bfz\u012br]]'', where the goal of punishment is correction or rehabilitation of the culprit and its form is largely left to the judge's discretion.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009c}} In practice, since early on in Islamic history, criminal cases were usually handled by ruler-administered courts or local police using procedures which were only loosely related to sharia.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009c}}\n\nThe two major genres of ''fur\u016b\u02bf'' literature are the ''mukhtasar'' (concise summary of law) and the ''mabsut'' (extensive commentary).{{sfn|Calder|2009}}  ''Mukhtasars'' were short specialized treatises or general overviews that could be used in a classroom or consulted by judges.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=10-11}} A ''mabsut'', which usually provided a commentary on a ''mukhtasar'' and could stretch to dozens of large volumes, recorded alternative rulings with their justifications, often accompanied by a proliferation of cases and conceptual distinctions.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=10-11}} The terminology of juristic literature was conservative and tended to preserve notions which had lost their practical relevance.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} At the same time, the cycle of abridgement and commentary allowed jurists of each generation to articulate a modified body of law to meet changing social conditions.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=10-11}} Other juristic genres include the ''qaw\u0101\u02bfid'' (succinct formulas meant to aid the student remember general principles) and collections of fatwas by a particular scholar.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}\n\nClassical jurisprudence has been described as \"one of the

[[Nondenominational Muslim]] branches]]\n\nThe main Sunni schools of law (''madhhabs'') are the [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]] and [[Hanbali]] madhhabs.{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} They emerged in the ninth and tenth centuries and by the twelfth century almost all jurists aligned themselves with a particular madhhab.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} These four schools recognize each other's validity and they have interacted in legal debate over the centuries.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} Rulings of these schools are followed across the Muslim world without exclusive regional restrictions, but they each came to dominate in different parts of the world.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}  For example, the Maliki school is predominant in North and West Africa; the Hanafi school in South and Central Asia; the Shafi'i school in Lower Egypt, East Africa, and Southeast Asia; and the Hanbali school in North and Central Arabia.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} The first centuries of Islam also witnessed a number of short-lived Sunni madhhabs.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} The [[Zahiri]] school, which is commonly identified as extinct, continues to exert influence over legal thought.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} The development of Shia legal schools occurred along the lines of theological differences and resulted in formation of the [[Twelver]], [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] and [[Ismaili]] madhhabs, whose differences from Sunni legal schools are roughly of the same order as the differences among Sunni schools.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} The [[Ibadi]] legal school, distinct from Sunni and Shia madhhabs, is predominant in Oman.{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}\n\nThe transformations of Islamic legal institutions in the modern era have had profound implications for the madhhab system.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}}  Legal practice in most of the Muslim world has come to be controlled by government policy and state law, so that the influence of the madhhabs beyond personal ritual practice depends on the status accorded to them within the national legal system.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} State law codification commonly utilized the methods of ''takhayyur'' (selection of rulings without restriction to a particular madhhab) and ''talfiq'' (combining parts of different rulings on the same question).{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} Legal professionals trained in modern law schools have largely replaced traditional [[ulema]] as interpreters of the resulting laws.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} Global Islamic movements have at times drawn on different madhhabs and at other times placed greater focus on the scriptural sources rather than classical jurisprudence.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} The Hanbali school, with its particularly strict adherence to the Quran and hadith, has inspired conservative currents of direct scriptural interpretation by the [[Salafi]] and [[Wahhabi]] movements.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} Other currents, such as networks of Indonesian ulema and Islamic scholars residing in Muslim-minority countries, have advanced liberal interpretations of Islamic law without focusing on traditions of a particular madhhab.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}}\n\n==Pre-modern Islamic legal system==\n\n=== Jurists ===\n{{Main|Mufti|Madrasa}}\n\nSharia was traditionally interpreted by [[mufti]]s. During the first few centuries of Islam, muftis were private legal specialists who normally also held other jobs. They issued [[fatwa]]s (legal opinions), generally free of charge, in response to questions from laypersons or requests for consultation coming from judges, which would be stated in general terms. Fatwas were regularly upheld in courts, and when they were not, it was usually because the fatwa was contradicted by a more authoritative legal opinion.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=9-10,13}} The stature of jurists was determined by their scholarly reputation.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=9-10}}{{sfn|Stewart|2013|p=499}} The majority of classical legal works, written by author-jurists, were based in large part on fatwas of distinguished muftis.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=9-10}} These fatwas functioned as a form of legal [[precedent]], unlike court verdicts, which were valid only for the given case.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|p=180}} Although independent muftis never disappeared, from the 12th century onward Muslim rulers began to appoint salaried muftis to answer questions from the public.{{sfn|Stewart|2013|p=501}} Over the centuries, [[Sunni]] muftis were gradually incorporated into state bureaucracies, while [[Shia]] jurists in Iran progressively asserted an autonomous authority starting from the early modern era.{{sfn|Dallal|Hendrickson|2009}}\n\n[[File:Samarkand, Registan, Ulugbek Medressa (6238565020).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Ulugh Beg Madrasa, Samarkand]] (est. 1422)]]\nIslamic law was initially taught in study circles that gathered in mosques and private homes. The teacher, assisted by advanced students, provided commentary on concise treatises of law and examined the students' understanding of the text. This tradition continued to be practiced in ''[[madrasa]]s'', which spread during the 10th and 11th centuries.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=45-47}}{{sfn|Lapidus|2014|p=217}} Madrasas were institutions of higher learning devoted principally to study of law, but also offering other subjects such as theology, medicine, and mathematics. The madrasa complex usually consisted of a mosque, boarding house, and a library. It was maintained by a ''[[waqf]]'' (charitable endowment), which paid salaries of professors, stipends of students, and defrayed the costs of construction and maintenance. At the end of a course, the professor granted a license (''[[ijaza]]'') certifying a student's competence in its subject matter.{{sfn|Lapidus|2014|p=217}} Students specializing in law would complete a curriculum consisting of preparatory studies, the doctrines of a particular madhhab, and training in legal disputation, and finally write a dissertation, which earned them a license to teach and issue fatwas.{{sfn|Stewart|2013|p=501}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=45-47}}\n\n=== Courts ===\n\n{{Main|Qadi|Mazalim|Shurta|Muhtasib}}\nA judge ([[qadi]]) was in charge of the qadi's court (''mahkama''), also called the sharia court. Qadis were trained in Islamic law, though not necessarily to a level required to issue fatwas.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=11-12}} Court personnel also included a number of assistants performing various roles.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|p=158}} Judges were theoretically independent in their decisions, though they were appointed by the ruler and often experienced pressure from members of the ruling elite where their interests were at play.{{sfn|Stewart|2013|p=501}} The role of qadis was to evaluate the evidence, establish the facts of the case, and issue a verdict based on the applicable rulings of Islamic jurisprudence.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} The qadi was supposed to solicit a fatwa from a mufti if it was unclear how the law should be applied to the case.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009}} Since Islamic legal theory does not recognize the distinction between private and public law, court procedures were identical for civil and criminal cases, and required a private plaintiff to produce evidence against the defendant. The main type of evidence was oral witness testimony. The standards of evidence for criminal cases were so strict that a conviction was often difficult to obtain even for apparently clear-cut cases.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} Most historians believe that because of these stringent procedural norms, qadi's courts at an early date lost their jurisdiction over criminal cases, which were instead handled in other types of courts.{{sfn|Tillier|2014}}\n\nIf an accusation did not result in a verdict in a qadi's court, the plaintiff could often pursue it in another type of court called the ''[[mazalim]]'' court, administered by the ruler's council.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} The rationale for ''mazalim'' (lit. wrongs, grievances) courts was to address the wrongs that sharia courts were unable to address, including complaints against government officials. Islamic jurists were commonly in attendance and a judge often presided over the court as a deputy of the ruler.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Stewart|2013|p=501}} ''Mazalim'' verdicts were supposed to conform to the spirit of sharia, but they were not bound by the letter of the law or the procedural restrictions of qadi's courts.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009}}\n\nThe police (''[[shurta]]''), which took initiative in preventing and investigating crime, operated its own courts.{{sfn|Stewart|2013|p=501}} Like the mazalim courts, police courts were not bound by the rules of sharia and had the powers to inflict discretionary punishments.{{sfn|Tillier|2014}} Another office for maintaining public order was the ''[[muhtasib]]'' (market inspector), who was charged with preventing fraud in economic transactions and infractions against public morality.{{sfn|Stewart|2013|p=501}} The ''muhtasib'' took an active role in pursuing these types of offenses and meted out punishments based on [[Urf|local custom]].{{sfn|Tillier|2014}}\n\n=== Socio-political context ===\n\n[[File:'Abd Allah ibn Shaykh Murshid al-Katib - Sa'di and a Dervish Go to Settle their Quarrel Before a Judge - Walters W618106B - Cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The poet [[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]] and a [[dervish]] go to settle their quarrel before a judge (16th century Persian miniature)]]\nThe social fabric of pre-modern Islamic societies was largely defined by close-knit communities organized around kinship groups and local neighborhoods. Conflicts between individuals had the potential to escalate into a conflict between their supporting groups and disrupt the life of the entire community. Court litigation was seen as a last resort for cases where informal mediation had failed. This attitude was reflected in the legal maxim  \"amicable settlement is the best verdict\" (''al-sulh sayyid al-ahkam''). In court disputes, qadis were generally less concerned with legal theory than with achieving an outcome that enabled the disputants to resume their previous social relationships. This could be accomplished by avoiding a total loss for the losing side or simply giving them a chance to articulate their position in public and obtain a measure of psychological vindication.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=57-60}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009b|pp=159-162}} Islamic law required judges to be familiar with local customs, and they exercised a number of other public functions in the community, including mediation and arbitration, supervision of public works, auditing waqf finances, and looking after the interests of orphans.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=11-12}}{{sfn|Tillier|2014}}\n\nUnlike pre-modern cultures where the ruling dynasty promulgated the law, Islamic law was formulated by religious scholars without involvement of the rulers. The law derived its authority not from political control, but rather from the collective doctrinal positions of the legal schools (madhhabs) in their capacity as interpreters of the scriptures. The [[ulema]] (religious scholars) were involved in management of communal affairs and acted as representatives of the Muslim population vis-\u00e0-vis the ruling dynasties, who before the modern era had limited capacity for direct governance.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|pp=166-167}} Military elites relied on the ulema for religious legitimation, with financial support for religious institutions being one of the principal means through which these elites established their legitimacy.{{sfn|Berkey|2003|pp=225-226}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|pp=166-167}} In turn, the ulema depended on the support of the ruling elites for the continuing operation of religious institutions. Although the relationship between secular rulers and religious scholars underwent a number of shifts and transformations in different times and places, this mutual dependence characterized Islamic history until the start of the modern era.{{sfn|Hodgson|1974|pp=176\u2013177}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|pp=166-167}} Additionally, since sharia contained few provisions in several areas of public law, Muslim rulers were able to legislate various collections of economic, criminal and administrative laws outside the jurisdiction of Islamic jurists, the most famous of which is the ''[[Qanun (law)|qanun]]'' promulgated by Ottoman sultans beginning from the 15th century.{{sfn|Stewart|2013|p=500}} The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Aurangzeb]] (r. 1658-1707) issued a hybrid body of law known as [[Fatawa-e-Alamgiri]], based on [[Hanafi]] fatwas as well as decisions of Islamic courts, and made it applicable to all religious communities on the [[Indian subcontinent]].

This conception was reinforced by the historical practice of sharia courts, where peasants \"almost always\" won cases against oppressive landowners, and non-Muslims often prevailed in disputes against Muslims, including such powerful figures as the governor of their province.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|p=61}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009b|p=167}} In family matters the sharia court was seen as a place where the rights of women could be asserted against their husband's transgressions.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}\n\n==Modern legal reforms==\n\n===Under colonial rule===\n\nStarting from the 17th century, European powers began to extend political influence over lands ruled by Muslim dynasties, and by the end of the 19th century, much of the Muslim world came under colonial domination. The first areas of Islamic law to be impacted were usually commercial and criminal laws, which impeded colonial administration and were soon replaced by European regulations.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|p=174}} Islamic commercial laws were also replaced by European (mostly French) laws in Muslim states which retained formal independence, because these states increasingly came to rely on Western capital and could not afford to lose the business of foreign merchants who refused to submit to Islamic regulations.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}\n\n[[File:Warren Hastings.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Warren Hastings]] initiated far-reaching legal reforms in the British India]]\nThe first significant changes to the legal system of [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]] were initiated in the late 18th century by the governor of Bengal [[Warren Hastings]]. Hastings' plan of legal reform envisioned a multi-tiered court system for the Muslim population, with a middle tier of British judges advised by local Islamic jurists, and a lower tier of courts operated by qadis. Hastings also commissioned a translation of the classic manual of Hanafi fiqh, ''[[Al-Hidayah]]'', from Arabic into Persian and then English, later complemented by other texts.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|p=176-181}}{{sfn|Masud|2009}} These translations enabled British judges to pass verdicts in the name of Islamic law based on a combination of sharia rules and [[common law]] doctrines, and eliminated the need to rely on consultation by local ulema, whom they mistrusted. In the traditional Islamic context, a concise text like ''Al-Hidayah'' would be used as a basis for classroom commentary by a professor, and the doctrines thus learned would be mediated in court by judicial discretion, consideration of local customs and availability of different legal opinions that could fit the facts of the case. The British use of ''Al-Hidayah'', which amounted to an inadvertent codification of sharia, and its interpretation by judges trained in Western legal traditions anticipated later legal reforms in the Muslim world.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|p=176-181}}{{sfn|Stewart|2013|p=503}}\n\nBritish administrators felt that sharia rules too often allowed criminals to escape punishment, as exemplified by Hastings' complaint that Islamic law was \"founded on the most lenient principles and on an abhorrence of bloodshed\".{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|p=176-181}} In the course of the 19th century, criminal laws and other aspects of the Islamic legal system in India were supplanted by British law, with the exception of sharia rules retained in family laws and some property transactions.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|p=176-181}}{{sfn|Masud|2009}} Among other changes, these reforms brought about abolition of slavery, prohibition of child marriage, and a much more frequent use of capital punishment.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009b|p=378}}{{sfn|Masud|2009}}  The resulting legal system, known as ''Anglo-Muhammadan law'', was treated by the British as a model for legal reforms in their other colonies. Like the British in India, colonial administrations typically sought to obtain precise and authoritative information about indigenous laws, which prompted them to prefer classical Islamic legal texts over local judicial practice. This, together with their conception of Islamic law as a collection of inflexible rules, led to an emphasis on traditionalist forms of sharia that were not rigorously applied in the pre-colonial period and served as a formative influence on the modern identity politics of the Muslim world.{{sfn|Masud|2009}}\n\n===Ottoman empire===\n\n[[File:1879-Ottoman Court-from-NYL.png|thumb|upright=1.8|An Ottoman courtroom (1879 drawing)]]\nDuring the colonial era, Muslim rulers concluded that they could not resist European pressure unless they modernized their armies and built centrally administered states along the lines of Western models. In the [[Ottoman empire]], the first such changes in the legal sphere involved placing the formerly independent [[waqf]]s under state control. This reform, passed in 1826, enriched the public treasury at the expense of the waqfs, thereby depleting the financial support for traditional Islamic legal education. Over the second half of the 19th century, a new hierarchical system of secular courts was established to supplement and eventually replace most religious courts. Students hoping to pursue legal careers in the new court system increasingly preferred attending secular schools over the traditional path of legal education with its dimming financial prospects.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|pp=174-176}} The [[Tanzimat]] reforms of the 19th century saw reorganization of both Islamic civil law and sultanic criminal law after the model of the [[Napoleonic Code]].{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}  In the 1870s, a codification of civil law and procedure (excepting marriage and divorce), called the ''[[Mecelle]]'', was produced for use in both sharia and secular courts. It adopted the Turkish language for the benefit of the new legal class who no longer possessed competence in the Arabic idiom of traditional jurisprudence. The code was based on Hanafi law, and its authors selected minority opinions over authoritative ones when they were felt to better \"suit the present conditions\". The Mecelle was promulgated as a ''[[qanun (law)|qanun]]'' (sultanic code), which represented an unprecedented assertion of the state's authority over Islamic civil law, traditionally the preserve of the ulema.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|pp=174-176}} The 1917 [[Ottoman family law|Ottoman Law of Family Rights]] adopted an innovative approach of drawing rules from minority and majority opinions of all Sunni madhhabs with a modernizing intent.{{sfn|Mayer|2009}} The [[Republic of Turkey]], which emerged after the [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]], abolished its sharia courts and replaced Ottoman civil laws with the [[Swiss Civil Code]],{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} but Ottoman civil laws remained in force for several decades in Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, and Iraq.{{sfn|Mayer|2009}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}\n\n===Nation states===\n\n[[File:Mahkamah Syariyah Aceh.jpg|thumb|''Mahkamah Syariyah'' (sharia court) in [[Aceh]], [[Indonesia]]]]\nWesternization of legal institutions and expansion of state control in all areas of law, which began during the colonial era, continued in nation-states of the Muslim world.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|pp=182-183}} Sharia courts at first continued to exist alongside state courts as in earlier times, but the doctrine that sultanic courts should implement the ideals of sharia was gradually replaced by legal norms imported from Europe. Court procedures were also brought in line with European practice. Though the Islamic terms ''qadi'' and ''mahkama'' (qadi's/sharia court) were preserved, they generally came to mean judge and court in the Western sense. While in the traditional sharia court all parties represented themselves, in modern courts they are represented by professional lawyers educated in Western-style law schools, and the verdicts are subject to review in an appeals court. In the 20th century, most countries abolished a parallel system of sharia courts and brought all cases under a national civil court system.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}\n\nIn most Muslim-majority countries, traditional rules of classical fiqh have been largely preserved only in family law. In some countries religious minorities such as Christians or Shia Muslims have been subject to separate systems of family laws.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} Many Muslims today believe that contemporary sharia-based laws are an authentic representation of the pre-modern legal tradition. In reality, they generally represent the result of extensive legal reforms made in the modern era.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|pp=182-183}} As traditional Islamic jurists lost their role as authoritative interpreters of the laws applied in courts, these laws were codified by legislators and administered by state systems which employed a number of devices to effect changes,{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} including:\n\n* Selection of alternative opinions from traditional legal literature (''takhayyur''), potentially among  multiple madhhabs or denominations, and combining parts of different rulings (''talfiq'').{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|pp=182-183}}{{sfn|Schacht|Layish|2000|p=155}}\n* Appeal to the classical doctrines of necessity (''darura''), public interest (''maslaha''), and the objectives (''maqasid'') of sharia, which played a limited role in classical fiqh, but were now given wider utilitarian applications.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|pp=182-183}}{{sfn|Schacht|Layish|2000|p=155}}{{sfn|Stewart|2013|p=503}}\n* Changes in administrative law that grant the courts discretionary powers to restrict certain practices which are not forbidden by substantive law (e.g., polygamy), in some cases imposing penal sanctions as additional deterrence.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|pp=182-183}}{{sfn|Schacht|Layish|2000|p=155}}\n* Modernist interpretation of Islamic scriptures without adherence to the rules or methodologies of traditional jurisprudence, known as ''neo-ijtihad''.{{sfn|Hallaq|2010|pp=182-183}}{{sfn|Schacht|Layish|2000|p=155}}\n\n[[File:The Late Grand Moufti (1906) - TIMEA.jpg|thumbnail|upright=0.7|[[Muhammad Abduh]] exercised a powerful influence on liberal reformist thought]]\nThe most powerful influence on liberal reformist thought came from the work of the Egyptian Islamic scholar [[Muhammad Abduh|Muhammad \u02bfAbduh]] (1849\u20131905). Abduh viewed only sharia rules pertaining to religious rituals as inflexible, and argued that the other Islamic laws should be adapted based on changing circumstances in consideration of social well-being. Following precedents of earlier Islamic thinkers, he advocated restoring Islam to its original purity by  returning to the Quran and the sunna instead of following the medieval schools of jurisprudence.{{sfn|Mayer|2009}} He championed a creative approach to ijtihad that involved direct interpretation of scriptures as well as the methods of ''takhayyur'' and ''talfiq''.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Mayer|2009}}\n\nOne of the most influential figures in modern legal reforms was the Egyptian legal scholar [[Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri]] (1895\u20131971), who possessed expertise in both Islamic and Western law. Sanhuri argued that reviving Islamic legal heritage in a way that served the needs of contemporary society required its analysis in light of the modern science of [[comparative law]]. He drafted the civil codes of Egypt (1949) and Iraq (1951) based on a variety of sources, including classical fiqh, European laws, existing Arab and Turkish codes, and the history of local court decisions.{{sfn|Mayer|2009}}{{sfn|Jones-Pauly|2009}} Sanhuri's Egyptian code incorporated few classical sharia rules, but he drew on traditional jurisprudence more frequently for the Iraqi code.{{sfn|Jones-Pauly|2009}} Sanhuri's codes were subsequently adopted in some form by most Arab countries.{{sfn|Mayer|2009}}\n\nAside from the radical reforms of Islamic family law carried out in Tunisia (1956) and Iran (1967), governments often preferred to make changes that made a clear break from traditional sharia rules by imposing administrative hurdles rather than changing the rules themselves, in order to minimize objections from religious conservatives. Various procedural changes have been made in a number of countries to restrict polygamy, give women greater rights in divorce, and eliminate child marriage. Inheritance has been the legal domain least susceptible to reform, as legislators have been generally reluctant to tamper with the highly technical system of [[Islamic inheritance jurisprudence|Quranic shares]].{{sfn|Mayer|2009}}{{sfn|Jones-Pauly|2009}} Some reforms have faced strong conservative opposition. For example, the 1979 reform of Egyptian family law, promulgated by [[Anwar Sadat]] through presidential decree, provoked an outcry and was annulled in 1985 by the supreme court on procedural grounds, to be later replaced by a compromise version.{{sfn|Mayer|2009}} The [[Mudawana|2003 reform of Moroccan family law]], which sought to reconcile universal human rights norms and the country's Islamic heritage, was drafted by a commission that included parliamentarians, religious scholars and feminist activists, and the result has been praised by international rights groups as an example of progressive legislation achieved within an Islamic framework.{{sfn|Rabb|2009d}}{{sfn|Mayer|2009}}\n\n===Islamization===\n\n{{Islamism sidebar|Concepts}}\n{{Main|Islamization}}\nThe [[Islamic revival]] of the late 20th century brought the topic of sharia to international attention in the form of numerous political campaigns in the Muslim world calling for full implementation of sharia.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Stewart|2013|pp=503-504}}  A number of factors have contributed to the rise of these movements, classified under the rubric of [[Islamism]] or [[political Islam]], including the failure of authoritarian secular regimes to meet the expectations of their citizens, and a desire of Muslim populations to return to more culturally authentic forms of socio-political organization in the face of a perceived cultural invasion from the West.{{sfn|Stewart|2013|pp=503-504}}{{sfn|Lapidus|2014|p=835}} Islamist leaders such as [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] drew on leftist anticolonialist rhetoric by framing their call for sharia as a resistance struggle. They accused secular leaders of corruption and predatory behavior, and claimed that a return to sharia would replace despotic rulers with pious leaders striving for social and economic justice. In the [[Arab world]] these positions are often encapsulated in the slogan \"Islam is the solution\" (''al-Islam huwa al-hall'').{{sfn|Stewart|2013|pp=503-504}}\n\nFull implementation of sharia theoretically refers to expanding its scope to all fields of law and all areas of public life.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} In practice, Islamization campaigns have focused on a few highly visible issues associated with the conservative Muslim identity, particularly women's [[hijab]] and the ''hudud'' criminal punishments (whipping, stoning and amputation) prescribed for certain crimes.{{sfn|Stewart|2013|pp=503-504}}  For many Islamists, ''hudud'' punishments are at the core of the divine sharia because they are specified by the letter of scripture rather than by human interpreters. Modern Islamists have often rejected, at least in theory, the stringent procedural constraints developed by classical jurists to restrict their application.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}} To the broader Muslim public, the calls for sharia often represent, even more than any specific demands, a vague vision of their current economic and political situation being replaced by a \"just utopia\".{{sfn|Lapidus|2014|p=835}}\n\nA number of legal reforms have been made under the influence of these movements, starting from the 1970s when Egypt and Syria amended their constitutions to specify sharia as the basis of legislation.{{sfn|Stewart|2013|pp=503-504}} The [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979 represented a watershed for Islamization advocates, demonstrating that it was possible to replace a secular regime with a theocracy.{{sfn|Stewart|2013|pp=503-504}} Several countries, including Iran, Pakistan, Sudan, and some Nigerian states have incorporated hudud rules into their criminal justice systems, which, however, retained fundamental influences of earlier Westernizing reforms.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Mayer|2009}} In practice, these changes were largely symbolic, and aside from some cases brought to trial to demonstrate that the new rules were being enforced, hudud punishments tended to fall into disuse, sometimes to be revived depending on the local political climate.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Otto|2008|p=20}} The supreme courts of Sudan and Iran have rarely approved verdicts of stoning or amputation, and the supreme courts of Pakistan and Nigeria have never done so.{{sfn|Otto|2008|p=20}} Nonetheless, Islamization campaigns have also had repercussions in several other areas of law, leading to curtailment of rights of women and religious minorities, and in the case of Sudan contributing to the breakout of a civil war.{{sfn|Mayer|2009}}\n\nAdvocates of Islamization have often been more concerned with ideology than traditional jurisprudence and there is no agreement among them as to what form a modern sharia-based \"[[Islamic state]]\" should take. This is particularly the case for the theorists of [[Islamic economics]] and [[Islamic finance]], who have advocated both free-market and socialist economic models.{{sfn|Mayer|2009}} The notion of \"sharia-compliant\" finance has become an active area of doctrinal innovation and its development has had a major impact on business operations around the world.{{sfn|Stewart|2013|pp=503-504}}\n\n==Role in contemporary Islam==\n\n===In state laws===\n\n{{main|Application of sharia law by country}}\n[[File:Use of Sharia by country.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|Use of sharia by country:<br />\n{{legend|#179C86|Sharia plays no role in the judicial system.}}\n{{legend|#F6DD4F|Sharia influences personal status (family) laws.}}\n{{legend|#706EA4|Sharia influences personal status and criminal laws.}}\n{{legend|#FF9950|Regional variations in the application of sharia.}}\n]]\n\n====Types of legal systems====\n\nThe legal systems of most Muslim-majority countries can be classified as either secular or mixed. Sharia plays no role in secular legal systems. In mixed legal systems, sharia rules are allowed to influence some national laws, which are codified and may be based on European or Indian models, and the central legislative role is played by politicians and modern jurists rather than the [[ulema]] (traditional Islamic scholars). Saudi Arabia and some other Gulf states possess what may be called classical sharia systems, where national law is largely uncodified and formally equated with sharia, with ulema playing a decisive role in its interpretation. Iran has adopted some features of classical sharia systems, while also maintaining characteristics of mixed systems, like codified laws and a parliament.{{sfn|Otto|2008|pp=8-9}}\n\n====Constitutional law====\n\nConstitutions of many Muslim-majority countries refer to sharia as a source or the main source of law, though these references are not in themselves indicative of how much the legal system is influenced by sharia, and whether the influence has a traditionalist or modernist character.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Calder|2009}} The same constitutions usually also refer to universal principles such as democracy and human rights, leaving it up to legislators and the judiciary to work out how these norms are to be reconciled in practice.{{sfn|Otto|2008|pp=18-19}} Conversely, some countries (e.g., Algeria), whose constitution does not mention sharia, possess sharia-based family laws.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} Nisrine Abiad identifies Bahrain, Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia as states with \"strong constitutional consequences\" of sharia \"on the organization and functioning of power\".{{sfn|Abiad|2008|pp=38-42}}\n\n====Family law====\n\nExcept for secular systems, Muslim-majority countries possess sharia-based laws dealing with family matters (marriage, inheritance, etc.).

Saudi Arabia has never adopted a criminal code and Saudi judges still follow traditional Hanbali jurisprudence. In the course of Islamization campaigns, several countries (Libya, Pakistan, Iran, Sudan, Mauritania, and Yemen) inserted Islamic criminal laws into their penal codes, which were otherwise based on Western models. In some countries only ''hudud'' penalties were added, while others also enacted provisions for ''[[qisas]]'' (law of retaliation) and ''[[Diya (Islam)|diya]]'' (monetary compensation). Iran subsequently issued a new \"Islamic Penal Code\". The criminal codes of Afghanistan and United Arab Emirates contain a general provision that certain crimes are to be punished according to Islamic law, without specifying the penalties. Some Nigerian states have also enacted Islamic criminal laws. [[Islamic criminal law in Aceh|Laws in the Indonesian province of Aceh]] provide for application of discretionary (''[[ta'zir]]'') punishments for violation of Islamic norms, but explicitly exclude ''hudud'' and ''qisas''.{{sfn|Tellenbach|2015|pp=249-250}} [[Brunei]] has been implementing a \"Sharia Penal Code\", which includes provisions for stoning and amputation, in stages since 2014.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=New York Times|author=Austin Ramzy|title=Brunei to Punish Adultery and Gay Sex With Death by Stoning|date=March 28, 2019|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/world/asia/brunei-adultery-gay-stoning.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Brunei Shariah law applies death sentence for homosexuality|newspaper=Deutsche Welle|date=March 27, 2019|url=https://www.dw.com/en/brunei-shariah-law-applies-death-sentence-for-homosexuality/a-48076114|access-date=27 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331093514/https://www.dw.com/en/brunei-shariah-law-applies-death-sentence-for-homosexuality/a-48076114|archive-date=31 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The countries where ''hudud'' penalties are legal do not use stoning and amputation routinely, and generally apply other punishments instead.{{sfn|Vik\u00f8r|2014}}{{sfn|Otto|2008|p=20}}{{sfn|Brown|2017}}\n\n====Muslim-minority countries====\n\nSharia also plays a role beyond religious rituals and personal ethics in some countries with Muslim minorities.

An [[International Islamic Fiqh Academy, Jeddah|International Islamic Fiqh Academy]] was created by the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], but its legal opinions are not binding.{{sfn|Masud|K\u00e9chichian|2009}} The vast amount of fatwas produced in the modern world attests to the importance of Islamic authenticity to many Muslims.

This perspective, which stresses comprehensive implementation of sharia, was widespread in the 1970s and 1980s among various movements seeking to establish an Islamic state, but its popularity has diminished in recent years.\n* The moderate Islamic view stresses the concepts of ''[[maslaha]]'' (public interest), ''[[Adl|\u02bfadl]]'' (justice), and ''shura''. Islamic leaders are considered to uphold justice if they promote public interest, as defined through ''shura''. In this view, ''shura'' provides the basis for representative government institutions that are similar to Western democracy, but reflect Islamic rather than Western liberal values. [[Hasan al-Turabi]], [[Rashid al-Ghannushi]], and [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] have advocated different forms of this view.\n* The liberal Islamic view is influenced by [[Muhammad Abduh]]'s emphasis on the role of reason in understanding religion. It stresses democratic principles based on pluralism and freedom of thought. Authors like [[Fahmi Huwaidi]] and [[Tariq al-Bishri]] have constructed Islamic justifications for full citizenship of non-Muslims in an Islamic state by drawing on early Islamic texts.

Marriage below the age of competence was permissible only if proof of sexual maturity was accepted in court, while marriage under the minimum age was forbidden. During the 20th century,  most countries in the Middle East followed the Ottoman precedent in defining the age of competence, while raising the minimum age to 15 or 16 for boys and 13-16 for girls. Marriage below the age of competence is subject to approval by a judge and the legal guardian of the adolescent. Egypt diverged from this pattern by setting the age limits of 18 for boys and 16 for girls, without a distinction between competence for marriage and minimum age.<ref name=EI2-8-29>{{Cite encyclopedia|author1=Schacht, J.|author2= Layish, A.|author3= Shaham, R.|author4= Ansari, Ghaus|author5= Otto, J.M.|author6= Pompe, S.|author7= Knappert, J. |author8=Boyd, Jean| year=1995 | title=Nik\u0101\u1e25|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editor1=P.

offensive ways of describing [[COVID-19]]. These terms are linked to [[Wuhan]], where the virus was first detected, or China in general, via [[portmanteau]] with terms from traditional [[Chinese Martial Arts]], ''Wushu'' and ''Kung Fu''. Use of these terms (popularised in social media and [[alt-right]] sources) not only downplays the seriousness of the deadly disease but also misinforms by suggesting it is a strain of [[influenza]] (when it is ''not'' a [[flu]]), while simultaneously mocking Chinese culture. It also implies that the pandemic is China's aggressive gift to the world, when actually thousands of Chinese suffered and died from COVID-19, especially in Wuhan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-coronavirus-china-virus-white-house-kung-flu|title=Trump doubles down on 'China virus', demands to know who in White House used phrase 'Kung Flu'|date=2020-03-18|website=Fox News|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329102358/https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-coronavirus-china-virus-white-house-kung-flu|archive-date=29 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2020/03/19/a-last-desperate-pivot-trump-and-his-allies-go-full-racist-on-coronavirus/|title=A last, desperate pivot: Trump and his allies go full racist on coronavirus|date=2020-03-19|website=Salon|language=en|access-date=2020-03-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329202750/https://www.salon.com/2020/03/19/a-last-desperate-pivot-trump-and-his-allies-go-full-racist-on-coronavirus/|archive-date=29 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Misinformation===\n\n{{main|Misinformation related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\nThe disease does not spread by shop items that have the name of \"Corona\" on them and products from China are not necessarily at risk of giving the disease either.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/01/30/coronavirus-is-not-the-corona-beer-virus-what-people-are-googling/|title=Coronavirus Is Not The 'Corona Beer Virus', What People Are Googling|last=Lee|first=Bruce Y.|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200316122432/https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/01/30/coronavirus-is-not-the-corona-beer-virus-what-people-are-googling/|archive-date=16 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/can-i-get-coronavirus-from-a-package-being-delivered-from-china|title=Can I get coronavirus from a package delivered from China?|date=2020-02-26|website=Daily Breeze|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\n\nBecause of its key role in the transmission and progression of SARS-CoV-2, [[Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2|ACE2]] has been the focus of a significant proportion of research and various [[Therapy|therapeutic]] approaches have been suggested.<ref name=\"Xu Zhong Deng Peng p.\"/> Personal hygiene, and a healthy lifestyle and [[Healthy diet|diet]] have been recommended to improve immunity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Li-sheng |last2=Wang |first2=Yi-ru |last3=Ye |first3=Da-wei |last4=Liu |first4=Qing-quan |title=A review of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) based on current evidence |journal=International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents |date=19 March 2020 |page=105948 |doi=10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105948 |pmid=32201353 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300984 |accessdate=27 March 2020 |language=en |issn=0924-8579 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200327232545/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300984 |archive-date=27 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Vaccine===\n\n{{main|COVID-19 vaccine}}\n\nThere is no available vaccine, but research into developing a vaccine has been undertaken by various agencies.

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

Qavam and several other dominant figures in Khorasan were charged with Tax evasion charges which evidence were provided to Pesyan by a [[Belgian]] named Dubois who was Director of Revenue in Khorasan.\n\nWhile Qavam was in prison in Tehran, Pesyan was declared Governor-general of Khorasan and ruled Khorasan autonomously even though he was a supporter of [[Seyyed Zia'eddin Tabatabaee]] the Prime Minister of Persia.\n\nIn May 1921, Qavam is freed from prison and Tabatabaee is no longer Prime Minister. Qavam becomes Prime Minister and plans to take revenge on Pesyan. As of May 30, 1921 Pesyan declares that Khorasan is fully Autonomous and he establishes the '''National Committee of Khorasan''' or '''Komitey-e Melli-e Khorasan''' in Persian. The committee starts a program of plans and reforms, however they face some fierce opposition by some tribal and religious leaders.\n\n== Plans ==\n\n'''Commenced between 2 April to 25 May'''\n*Reform the military organisation of Khorasan and proclamation of martial law. The ''nizam'' (infantry) and Gendarmerie were combined to form this new force. New soldiers were heavily recruited for the new force. In April there were only 200 Gendarms while in October there were approximately 5,000.\n*Setup of a finance commission to investigate and assess revenue claims. This had outraged wealthy tribal chiefs and merchants.\n*Reform of the shrine administration, this included steps to be taken against those shrine administrators who had consumed vast amount of shrine's revenues.\n*Subsidisine two local newspapers ''Sharq-e-Iran'' (The East of Iran) and ''Mihr-e-Monir'' (The Shining Sun) to support the government of Seyed Zia Tabatabaei.\n\n'''Commenced between 26 May to 6 Oct'''\n*Impose of censorship in the telegraph office.\n*Series of arrest of persons believed to have been collaborating with Persia's Central Government of Ahmad Qavam.\n*''Kumiteye Melli-e Khorasan'' (National Committee of Khorasan) issued a manifesto on 15 September 1921, and prepared a proclamation declaring Khorasan a republic which was postponed by Colonel Pesyan and never implemented.\n*Sold a large amount of grain to a Bolshevik Food Purchasing Commission.\n*Extracted forced loans from the wealthy and auctioned off the belongings of the defeated tribal chiefs.\n*Encouraged anti-British stance, pro-Soviet ideas and Persian Nationalist beliefs.\n*Imposed a poll tax on all travellers leaving Mashhad and 10% Tax on all exports.\n*Encouraged export of goods to Afghanistan and Soviet Union.\n*Established a local Bank in September 1921.\n*Striking of its own coinage was also considered.\n*Steps for the inception of a Department of Education were taken, Colonel Pesyan himself gave money in the interests of female schooling.\n\n== Battles ==\n\nSeveral tribal leaders who had lost most of their wealth and belongings due to Pesyan's reform programs were supported by Qavam's government.  Therefore, on August 11, 1921 the first battle took place between a detachment of Gendarmes in a village near [[Kariz, Bamyan|Kariz]] on [[Afghanistan]] border and forces of [[Hazara people|Hazara]] chief Shuja al-Mulk. Gendarmes defeated and fled to [[Mashhad]]. This defeat results in appointment of Shawkat al-Dowlah a rival of Shuja al-Mulk as Governor of [[Torbat-e-Jam]] with a task to deal with disturbances and a sending of strong numerous gendarme forces on August 20, 1921.\n\nIn September, 1921 Gendarme forces from [[Kariz, Bamyan|Kariz]], [[Torbat-e-Jam]], [[Torbat-e Heydarieh]] defeated the strong tribal confederatory force of [[Hazara people|Hazara]], [[Baloch people|Baluch]], Barbari and [[Qarai Turks]], whose leaders were Shuja al-Mulk, Seyed Heydar Barbari, Salar Khan Baluch, Mir Ali Ahmad Barbari, Ibrahim Khan Baluch and Jafar Khan Qaraei in a battle which took place in [[Bakharz]]. Shuja fled to Afghanistan and the tribal disturbances in the south-east were stopped.\n\nOctober 3, 1921 Pesyan himself took battle leading his 150 Gendarmes to fight a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] coalition tribal force which had more than 1,000 men, led by Sardar of [[Bojnurd]] and Taj Mohammad Khan of [[Quchan]], who were also financially and militarily aided by the British and Persian government of Ahmad Qavam.  Pesyan fought bravely with only 60 bullets, however he and his small force were circled by the Kurds and were martyred.  Pesyan's head was cut off as proof of his death and sent to Qavam.\n\n== Collapse ==\n\nAfter Pesyan's death, the committee was no longer united.  A new rivalry started between Nowzari and Ismail Khan Bahador, who were Pesyan's partisans.  Nowzari managed to take charge of Khorasan and he surrendered to Persia's government.  In November, 1921 a strong military force of Gendarmes and Cossacks arrived in [[Mashhad]] and handed the administrative duties to the newly appointed Governor-General of the province.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* ''An Experiment in Revolutionary Nationalism: The Rebellion of Colonel Muhammad Taqi Khan Pasyan in Mashhad, April\u2013October 1921'', Stephanie Cronin, Journal of Middle Eastern Studies, Vol.33, No. 4 October 1997, pp.&nbsp;693\u2013750.\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* [https://books.google.nl/books/about/Soldiers_Shahs_and_Subalterns_in_Iran.html?id=WPOADAAAQBAJ Soldiers, Shahs and Subalterns in Iran: Opposition, Protest and Revolt, 1921-1941]\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.iichs.org/index.asp?id=45&doc_cat=1 Institute of Iranian Contemporary History Studies]\n* [http://www.tabriz-info.com/tabriz/shahrdaran/bahdor-esmael.htm Tabriz-Info]\n{{Unrecognized states in the Iranian territory}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Autonomous Government Of Khorasan}}\n[[Category:1921 disestablishments in Asia]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1921]]\n[[Category:History of North Khorasan Province]]\n[[Category:History of South Khorasan Province]]\n[[Category:History of Razavi Khorasan Province]]\n[[Category:History of Golestan Province]]\n[[Category:20th century in Iran]]\n[[Category:1921 in Asia]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=August 2011}}\n{{Prose|date=July 2018}}\n{{Infobox Former Country\n|conventional_long_name = Autonomous State of Khorasan\n|common_name = Khorasan\n|status = Unrecognized\n|year_start = 1921\n|date_start = April\n|year_end = 1921\n|date_end = November\n|p1 = Persia\n|flag_p1 = State flag of Iran (1907-1933).svg\n|s1 = Persia\n|flag_s1 = State flag of Iran (1907-1933).svg\n|image_flag = State flag of Iran (1907-1933).svg\n|image_map = |image_map_caption = \n|capital = Mashhad\n|government_type = Military occupation\n|title_leader = President\n|leader1 = [[Mohammad Taqi Pessian]]\n|year_leader1 = 2 Apr &ndash; 3 Oct 1921\n|title_representative = Governor-General\n|representative1 = Mahmoud Khan Nowzari\n|year_representative1 = {{nowrap|4 Oct &ndash; Nov 1921 <small>(acting)</small>}}\n|representative2 = Ismail Khan Bahador\n|year_representative2 = 16 Nov 1921\n|stat_year1 = 1921\n|stat_area1 = 388332\n|stat_pop1 = \n|currency = \n}}\n\nThe '''Autonomous Government of Khorasan''' was a short-lived military state set up in what is now [[Iran]].
