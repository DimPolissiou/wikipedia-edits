Zelenko, who must self-isolate since he is missing a lung, says in daily [[YouTube]] videos he posts that his office has treated 500 patients (mostly in Kiryas Joel) for COVID-19, using the combination of [[hydroxychloroquine]] and [[azithromycin]] or [[zinc sulfate]], which has in some trials yielded positive results in reducing symptoms.

{"title_page": "History of Tampa, Florida", "text_new": "{{main|Tampa, Florida|History of Florida}}\n\n( This doesn't hep if you are looking for the industry that helped make Tampa) The modern '''history of Tampa, Florida''' can be traced to the founding of [[Fort Brooke]] at the mouth of the [[Hillsborough River (Florida)|Hillsborough River]] in today's [[downtown Tampa|downtown]] in 1824, soon after the United States had taken possession of Florida from [[Spanish Florida|Spain]]. The outpost brought a small population of civilians to the area, and the town of Tampa was first incorporated in 1855.\n\nGrowth came slowly as poor transportation links, conflicts with the [[Seminole|Seminole tribe]], and repeated outbreaks of [[yellow fever]] made development difficult. The [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] caused the city government to disincorporate for over a decade.\n\nIn the 1880s the construction of the first [[railroad]] links laid by [[Henry B. Plant]] brought the development of thriving [[cigar]] and [[Phosphate mining in the United States|phosphate]] industries. The founding of the cigar-centered [[Neighborhoods in Tampa, Florida|neighborhood]] of [[Ybor City]] in 1885 brought an influx of [[Cubans]], [[Spaniards]], [[Italians]], and other immigrants. Tampa's population jumped from less than 800 residents in 1880 to over 15,000 in 1900, making it one of the largest cities in Florida.\n\nBy the 20th century Tampa emerged as a modern financial, trade, and commercial hub. It saw the start of the [[Gasparilla Pirate Festival]] and pioneering aviator [[Tony Jannus]] captaining the inaugural flight of the [[St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line]], the world's first commercial [[passenger airline]]. It also saw the rise of organized crime.\n\nThe number of residents exceeded 100,000 during the 1930s, 250,000 during the 1950s, and 300,000 during the 1990s. The land area of Tampa also grew, most notably when the city annexed the neighboring communities of [[West Tampa]] in 1925, [[Sulphur Springs, Tampa, Florida|Sulphur Springs]] and [[Palma Ceia, Tampa, Florida|Palma Ceia]] in 1953, [[Port Tampa]] in 1961, and [[New Tampa]] in 1988. Most of the land added to Tampa over the years was unincorporated. Five incorporated municipalities{{disputed inline|date=June 2014}} have been consolidated into Tampa: North Tampa, Ybor City, Fort Brooke, West Tampa, and Port Tampa.<ref name=\"ws1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/US_Mayors2.html|title=Mayors of U.S. Cities M-W|author=Ben Cahoon|date=|publisher=Worldstatesmen.org|accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Florida History Navbar}}\nThere is some dispute as to the origin and meaning of the name \"Tampa\". It is believed to mean \"sticks of fire\" in the language of the [[Calusa]], an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] tribe that once lived south of the area. This may relate to the high concentration of [[lightning]] strikes that west central Florida receives every year during the summer months.\n\nOther historians claim the name refers to \"the place to gather sticks\".

Artifacts suggest that early inhabitants of the region relied on the sea for most of their resources, and a vast majority of inhabited sites have been found on or near the shoreline.\n\nThe [[Manasota culture]] is the earliest documented group, spanning from about 500 B.C. until about 700 A.D., by which time it had evolved into the [[Safety Harbor culture]]. It loosely organized into three or four chiefdoms on the shores of the bay.\n\nThe [[Tocobaga]]'s principal town was located at the northern end of Old Tampa Bay near today's [[Safety Harbor, Florida|Safety Harbor]] in [[Pinellas County]]. [[Uzita (Florida)|Uzita]] controlled the south shore of Tampa Bay, from the [[Little Manatee River]] to [[Sarasota Bay]]. [[Mocoso]] was on the east side of Tampa Bay, on the [[Alafia River]] and, possibly, the Hillsborough River.

The ill-fated [[Narv\u00e1ez Expedition]] landed near present-day Tampa with the intention of starting a colony. After being told by the natives of wealthier cultures to the north, they abandoned their camp after only a week to begin a long but futile search for non-existent riches.

The bay was rechristened \"Hillsborough Bay\" after [[Lord Hillsborough]], the then-[[Secretary of State for the Colonies]]. Though the name \"Tampa Bay\" was later restored, the English period is still reflected in the names of Hillsborough river and county. Like Spain, Britain was much more concerned with the strategically important Atlantic coast of Florida (especially [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]]) than other parts of the territory and did not attempt to found settlements along the Gulf coast.\n\nHowever, the Tampa Bay area did have a few residents: Indians and [[Cubans|Cuban]] fishermen who lived in a seasonal encampment at the mouth of [[Spanish Town Creek]], a freshwater stream that once ran through today's [[Hyde Park (Tampa)|Hyde Park neighborhood]] to [[Bayshore Boulevard]]. A handful of these people may have stayed year round, but the majority spent a few months catching and smoking fish (especially [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]]) from the teeming waters of the bay, then returned to sell them in Cuba.<ref>{{cite web|author=Thomas Angarano |url=http://www.webcoast.com/pinellas.htm |title=About Tampa Bay \u2013 Pinellas County History |publisher=Webcoast.com |date=1915-05-27 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref>\n\nSpain regained control of Florida in 1783 as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] at the end of the [[American Revolution]].

The site was marked by a huge [[hickory tree]] set atop an ancient [[Indian mound]] most likely built by the Tocobaga centuries before.[[File:Fort Brooke.jpg|thumb|Barracks and tents at Fort Brooke in Tampa Bay, c. 1835|alt=|left]]Colonel Brooke, the outpost's first commander, directed his troops to clear the area for the construction of a [[Fortification|wooden fort]] and support buildings, but ordered that several ancient [[live oak]] trees inside the encampment be spared to provide shade and cheer.<ref name=\"Brown, Cantor\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1999}}</ref>  On January 22, 1824, the post was officially named [[Fort Brooke]].<ref>{{cite web|author=museumofcigars.com |url=http://www.museumofcigars.com/fort-brooke.htm |title=fort brooke |publisher=Museumofcigars.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref> [[John Mercer Brooke]] was born there.

Dade]]  while they were on their way from Fort Brooke to Fort King (near present-day [[Ocala]]) in a rout that was dubbed the [[Dade Massacre]], triggering the [[Second Seminole War]]. \n\nDuring the war, Fort Brooke first served as a refuge for settlers, then as a vital military depot and staging area. After almost seven years of vicious fighting, the war was over and the Seminoles were forced away from the Tampa region, and the tiny village began a period of slow growth. \n\n==== Third Seminole War ====\n[[File:Billy bowlegs harpers.jpg|thumb|130px|Seminole Billy Bowlegs]]\nSeminole chief [[Billy Bowlegs]] attacked the whites at Fort Myers in late 1855 triggering the [[Third Seminole War]]. When the news of the attack reached Tampa, the men of the city elected militia officers and organized companies. The newly formed militia marched to the Peace River valley, recruited more men, and manned some forts along the river.\n\n==Statehood to Civil War==\nThe Territory of Florida had grown enough by 1845 to become the 27th state.

Of particular importance was the founding of the cigar-centered neighborhood of Ybor City in 1885, which brought a large influx of Cubans, Spaniards, Italians, and a handful of other immigrants to what had previously been a typical small southern town. Ybor City and North Tampa were annexed into Tampa in 1887.<ref name=\"ws1\" />\n\nThese changes combined to bring sudden prosperity and explosive growth \u2013 Tampa's population jumped from less than 800 residents in 1880 to over 15,000 in 1900, making it one of the largest cities in Florida.\n\nW. B. Henderson was foreman of the first [[volunteer fire department|volunteer]] [[Tampa Fire Rescue Department|fire fighting group]] in Tampa, Hook & Ladder Company No. 1, organized in 1884. On May 8, 1886 a fire destroyed all the buildings on the block bounded by Franklin, Whiting, Tampa, and Washington streets, with the exception of the First National Bank.<ref>{{Harvnb|Grismer|1950|pages=192\u2013193}}</ref> Also in 1886, the first police force was created in Tampa.\n\n[[Herman Glogowski]], the town's first Jewish mayor, was elected in 1886. Also in 1886, [[Maas Brothers]] department store was founded by Abe and Bena Maas, also Jewish, which would eventually grow to a chain of 39 stores throughout the state.\n\nHenderson assisted in the creation of the ''[[Tampa Times]]'' newspaper in 1893, and daily publication of the ''[[Tampa Tribune]]'' began in 1895 when [[Wallace Stovall]] upgraded printing from once a week.{{refn|group=n|Stovall's [[Stovall House|house]] on Bayshore Boulevard still stands.}} Also in 1895, Eleanor Chamberlain was president of Tampa's first suffrage organization.\n\n=== Phosphate discovered ===\n[[Phosphate]], a mineral used to make fertilizers and other products, was discovered in the [[Bone Valley]] region southeast of Tampa in 1880 by \"Captain Bill\" Kendrick, \"the original [[Florida cracker]]\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hazen|1914|page=14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/25848425/the_weekly_tribune/?xid=637|title=Capt W.

There, he constructed the St. Elmo Inn and Port Tampa Inn for a hoped-for influx of visitors. The Port Tampa Inn was larger and had the distinction of being constructed directly on the bay on stilts.<ref name=\"pt1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.porttampa.org/port_tampa_city_Ghost.htm |title=Port_Tampa_City_Yesteryear |publisher=Porttampa.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref> Both of these early hotels are long gone.\n\n=====The Tampa Bay Hotel=====\n[[File:Detroit Photographic Company (0279).jpg|thumb|240px|Tampa Bay Hotel, ca. 1900.]]\nPlant Park was laid out in 1888.

Designed by [[J. A. Wood]], the eclectic [[Moorish Revival]] structure with [[minarets]] cost $2.5 million to build, a huge sum for the time.\n\nPlant went on an extensive European tour while the resort was being built and sent back exotic art collectables from around the world to display at his \"playground\". The structure also boasted the first electric lights in Tampa and the first elevator in Florida.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmuseum.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=14&Itemid=35 |title=Henry B.

E. Mitchell, operated by the [[TECO Line Streetcar System|Tampa Street Railway Company]], which included Henderson and Lesley as members.<ref>{{Harvnb|Grismer|1950|page=190}}</ref>\n\nIn 1892 it merged with the Florida Electric Company to form the Tampa Street Railway and Power Company, and converted to electrically powered streetcars in 1893. The Consumers Electric Light and Street Railway Company bought out the Tampa Street Railway Company in 1894. The company also acquired control of the Tampa and Palmetto Beach Rail Company, becoming the sole streetcar operator in Tampa. The [[TECO Energy|Tampa Electric Company]] acquired control of the Consumers Electric Light and Street Railway Company in 1899.\n\nThe Tampa Electric Company acquired 21 miles (34&nbsp;km) of streetcar track. After acquiring the Tampa and Sulphur Springs Traction Company in 1913, Tampa Electric had almost 50 miles (80&nbsp;km) of track, increasing to 53 miles (85&nbsp;km) by 1926. That year the Tampa Electric system carried almost 24 million passengers. The streetcar system in Tampa was shut down after World War II.\n\nStreetcars returned to Tampa in 2002, when the initial 2.4&nbsp;mi (3.86&nbsp;km) long heritage line was opened, operated by the [[Hillsborough Area Regional Transit|transit authority]].\n\n===Cigar industry===\n\n[[File:Seal of Tampa, Florida.svg|thumb|120px|Seal of Tampa]]\n\nThe new railroad link attracted another industry which would finally make Tampa prosper. In 1885, the Tampa Board of Trade, especially W. C. Brown and W. B. Henderson, helped broker a land deal with [[Vicente Martinez Ybor]], Ignacio Haya, and [[Gavino Gutierrez]] to move their [[cigar]] manufacturing operations to Tampa from [[Key West]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Grismer|1950|pages=182\u2013183}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://ucf.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/ucf%3A22405/datastream/OBJ/view/The_Florida_historical_quarterly.pdf|journal=The Florida Historical Quarterly|volume=45|title=The Historical Beginnings of Ybor City and Modern Tampa|author=Durward Long|page=34}}</ref>\n\nGutierrez had first come to Tampa in 1884 due to a false rumor about the ability to find [[guava]] trees.{{refn|group=n|In the 1970s columnist Steve Otto gave Tampa the nickname [[The Big Guava]], mimicking New York's \"[[Big Apple]]\".  Halloween in Ybor City is known as [[Guavaween]].}} Ybor had been attracted by Tampa's warm and humid climate, which kept [[tobacco]] fresh and workable, and its new transportation links. Close proximity (and Henry Plant's [[steamship]]s) made import of fine Cuban tobacco easy by sea, and Plant's railroad made shipment of finished cigars to the rest of the US market easy by land. This relationship is acknowledged in the [[Seal of Tampa]], which depicts Plant's steamship ''Mascotte'', a vessel that carried thousands of immigrants and tons of tobacco to Tampa.\n\n====Ybor City====\n{{see also|History of Ybor City}}\n[[File:El Pasaje Ybor.jpg|thumb|[[El Pasaje]], one of the first buildings in Ybor City]]\n\nYbor built the [[Ybor Factory Building]] and [[El Pasaje]] and Ybor City (as the settlement was dubbed) quickly made Tampa a major cigar production center. Ybor City began as a separate [[municipality]], but, seeing the potential for greatly increased tax rolls, the city of Tampa annexed the bustling community in 1886.\n\nSince Tampa was still a small town at the time (population less than 5,000), Ybor built hundreds of small houses around his factory to accommodate the immediate influx of thousands of Cuban and Spanish cigar workers. Other cigar manufacturers soon moved in, such as [[Cuesta-Rey]]. In 1896, Ybor built a large [[Florida Brewing Company building|brewery]], the tallest building in the [[Ybor City Historic District|historic district]].\n\n=====Immigrants=====\n\n====== Cubans ======\n[[File:Jose Marti in Ybor City.jpg|thumb|Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed with cigar factory workers in Ybor City, 1893.]]In the early 1890s, [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed]] was invited to Ybor City to collect funding for the cause of Cuban independence, which he did alongside [[Paulina Pedroso]].\n\n====== Spaniards ======\nIn the 1890s, Las Novedades, Tampa's oldest restaurant, opened.<ref>http://www.tampapix.com/lasnovedades.htm</ref>\n\n====== Italians ======\nStarting in the late 1880s, many Italian and a few eastern European Jewish immigrants also arrived. These new arrivals had difficulty breaking into the insular cigar businesses, so many opened businesses and shops that catered to the cigar workers.[[File:Ferlita Bakery.jpg|thumb|180px|Ferlita Bakery]]\n\nThe majority of Italian immigrants came from [[Alessandria Della Rocca]] and [[Santo Stefano Quisquina]], two small [[Sicily|Sicilian]] towns with which Tampa still maintains strong ties. In 1896, Sicilian Francisco Ferlita established what is likely the earliest U.S. bakery to produce [[Cuban bread]], now the site of [[Ybor City Museum State Park]].\n\n====West Tampa====\nIn 1892, [[Scottish-American|Scottish]] businessman Hugh MacFarlane founded [[West Tampa]], a new community across the Hillsborough River that sought to attract more cigar factories and workers. By 1900, the town already had one of the largest populations in Florida, mostly Cubans involved in the cigar industry.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web|last=Garcia |first=Wayne |url=http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A11138 |title=Creative Loafing Tampa &#124; News &#124; The Western Front |publisher=Tampa.creativeloafing.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabayhistorycenter.org/cigar.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227114313/http://www.tampabayhistorycenter.org/cigar.htm |archivedate=2007-02-27 }}</ref>\n\n===New churches===\nNew church [[Christian denomination|denominations]] came to Tampa, including [[St. Andrews Episcopal Church (Tampa, Florida)|St. Andrew's Episcopal]] in 1871,<ref>[http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=26906 \u201cSt. Andrew\u2019s Episcopal Church\u201d.] [http://www.hmdb.org ''The Historical Marker Database''.].

Plant's selection of the Tampa Bay Hotel site was quite deliberate.  He chose a large piece of land near his railroad depot, yet separate from the town.

In 1931, there was a [[Tampa cigar makers' strike of 1931|strike]] of cigar workers.\n\nBy 1929, Maas Brothers dominated Florida's West Coast. It was known as \"Greater Tampa's Greatest Store.\" The [[Flag of Tampa, Florida|flag of Tampa]] was adopted in 1930.\n\nThe Davis Causeway opened in 1934. The [[Colonnade (restaurant)|Colonnade]] restaurant was established in 1935.\n\n==== WW2 ====\nThe [[Fort Homer W. Hesterly Armory]] was built in the 1930s and dedicated the day of the attack on Pearl Harbor. During World War II, the [[Tampa Shipbuilding Company]] built several ships. [[Frank Adamo]] was a prison camp physician who took part in the [[Bataan Death March]]. Tampa celebrated \"Frank Adamo Day\" on April 27, 1945 with a parade.\n\n====1950s growth====\nTampa remained a compact city with a land area of {{convert|19|sqmi|km2|0}} until the mid-1950s.<ref>[https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab16.txt 1930 U.S. Census]</ref><ref>[https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab17.txt 1940 U.S. Census]</ref><ref name=\"tab18\">[https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab18.txt 1950 U.S. Census]</ref>  Its northernmost boundary was the Hillsborough River, in the northern part of the [[Seminole Heights, Tampa, Florida|Seminole Heights]] neighborhood.<ref>[http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/23761117v1_TOC.pdf census.gov]</ref> In 1953, the city annexed over {{convert|60|sqmi|km2|-1}} of unincorporated land, including the communities of Sulphur Springs and Palma Ceia.

Suburban growth hollowed downtown as business deteriorated. Many industries began to move to outlying areas. The combination of the decline of the cigar industry and the construction of Interstates [[Interstate 4|4]] and [[Interstate 275 (Florida)|275]] further deteriorated historic areas such as Ybor City and West Tampa.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flheritage.com/services/magazine/index.cfm?action=article&season=06spring&article=50|title=Services \u2013 Office of Cultural & Historical Programs|author=[By Elaine C.

USF's [[Graphicstudio]] and [[University of South Florida Botanical Gardens|Botanical Gardens]] began in 1969\n\n=== Museums ===\nIn 1962, the [[Museum of Science & Industry (Tampa)|Museum of Science and Industry]] was founded. The [[Cracker Country]] museum started in 1978 and the [[Tampa Museum of Art]] began in 1979. The Ybor City Museum Society was established in 1982. The [[Glazer Children's Museum|Children's Museum]] started in 1987. Tampa's first history museum were started in 1989.

The [[Tampa Marriott Waterside]], the area's largest hotel, was completed in 2000.\n\n=== Segregation ===\nSegregation continued into the 20th century. Most blacks lived in \"the Scrub\" (Tampa's [[Central Avenue (Tampa, Florida)|Central Avenue]] district), West Tampa, Ybor City, [[Dobyville]], and College Hill. According to Benjamin Mays' report ''A Study of Negro Life in Tampa'', the black population grew from 4,383 in 1900 to 23,323 in 1927. Businessman [[Moses White (activist)|Moses White]] was known as the \"Mayor of Central Avenue\". [[Ole Pete]] was supposed to live in Port Tampa.\n[[File:Jackson Rooming House Tampa.jpg|thumb|160px|Jackson Rooming House]]\n\nThe [[Jackson Rooming House]], the area's only boarding house for blacks,  was built in the Scrub in 1901.  In 1908, [[Clara C. Frye]] opened a hospital for black patients in her home, assisted by Mack Winton. Her dining room table was the [[operating table]].\n\nA building was secured in 1923 and was purchased by the City of Tampa in 1928. The Clara Frye Memorial Hospital that existed in West Tampa from 1938 to 1967 was named after her. The Tampa Municipal Hospital did not admit black patients until the 1950s.\n\nIn 1922, [[Garfield Devoe Rogers Sr.]] helped start the Central Life Insurance Company, which sold policies to blacks. In 1938, [[Blanche Armwood]] became the first black woman in Florida to graduate from an accredited law school. Black Cuban Francisco Rodriguez became a lawyer in 1951. In 1952, the NAACP moved its state headquarters to Tampa, and educator Edward Daniel Davis was president of Central Life Insurance Company.\n\nIn 1919, William W. Andrews opened the ''[[Florida Sentinel]]'' newspaper office in Jacksonville. The office was closed during the Depression. In 1945, General Andrews's son, C. Blythe Andrews, re-opened the ''Florida Sentinel'' on Central Avenue. In 1959, he bought the ''Tampa Bulletin'' newspaper, and merged the two newspapers to make the ''Florida Sentinel Bulletin''. In 1962, the newspaper office was moved to Ybor City.<ref>[http://www.hmdb.org/PhotoFullSize.asp?PhotoID=67579 Florida Sentinel Bulletin Marker] (photo).</ref> The [[C. Blythe Andrews Jr. Public Library]] was named in his honor.\n\n[[Cody Fowler]] formed the Bi-Racial Commission in 1959. His mother Maude helped develop Temple Terrace and is the namesake of [[Florida State Road 582|Fowler Avenue]].{{refn|group=n|Cody's [[Cody Fowler House|house]] is in Temple Terrace.}}\n\n=== Women ===\nIn 1900, the Tampa Woman's Club formed.<ref>https://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1164&context=sunlandtribune</ref> Kate V. Jackson founded the Tampa Civic Association in 1911. In 1923, Elizabeth Dortsch Barnard was the town's first female postmaster.  In 1926, the [[Junior League]] of Tampa was founded.\n\n===Mafia===\n[[File:Bolita balls.jpg|right|thumb|200px| A set of bolita balls on display at the Ybor City State Museum.]]\nBeginning in the late 19th century, illegal [[bolita]] lotteries were very popular among the Tampa working classes, especially in Ybor City.\n\n==== Charlie Wall ====\nIn the early 1920s, this small-time operation was taken over by [[Charlie Wall]], whose father was the town's former mayor and a pioneer in yellow fever research, [[John Perry Wall]], and whose mother was a McKay.\n\nWall's operations thrived as he expanded them to include liquor distribution and speakeasies (this was the era of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]) and prostitution. Other smaller [[organized crime]] groups tried to muscle in on the action, and long-simmering rivalries were kindled.\n\nThese organizations were able to operate openly because of kick-backs and bribes to key local politicians and law enforcement officials. Wall was well-connected, and he used those connections to keep his businesses running and put down his competition. Tampa's political elite, which had held an inconsistent but mostly ambivalent attitude toward organized crime, quietly became de facto partners.\n\n==== Trafficantes and the Era of Blood ====\n{{see also|Trafficante crime family}}\nWhile Charlie Wall was Tampa's first major crime boss, various factions vied for control of the area in later years. Ongoing power struggles resulted in regular organized-crime related \"unsolved\" murders of crime-connected figures in what became known as the \"Era of Blood\". To protect their interests (and keep gangland killings unsolved), crime bosses regularly kept local officials \u2013 from state attorneys to top law enforcement personnel and even mayors \u2013 on the payroll.<ref>{{cite web|last=Deitche |first=Scott |url=http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/the_mob/Content?oid=317 |title=Creative Loafing Tampa &#124; News &#124; Cover &#124; The Mob |publisher=Tampa.creativeloafing.com |accessdate=2010-05-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113104959/http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/the_mob/Content?oid=317 |archivedate=2009-01-13 }}</ref>\n[[File:Santo Trafficante, Jr.jpg|thumb|130px|Santo Trafficante, Jr. mugshot]]\nThe first Italian gang in the Tampa Bay area was created by the Sicilian [[Ignacio Antinori]] in 1925.

The first widespread example was Tampa's mayoral election of 1931, when over 100 people were arrested for \"cheating at the polls\". Most were supporters of the winning candidate, Robert E. Lee Chancey, who his opponents claimed had close ties to Tampa's \"underworld\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{Harvnb|Kerstein|2001}}</ref> After the election, all of the charges were either reduced or dropped altogether. Many of those involved had been on the city payroll at the time of their arrest, and most remained there.\n \nThe situation was even more chaotic during the next election cycle in 1935. This started before election day when Tampa's chief of police (who supported the incumbent mayor) and the Hillsborough County Sheriff (who supported the challenger) both claimed to be the proper authority to monitor the actual voting. Anticipating trouble, [[David Sholtz|Florida Governor Sholtz]] mobilized the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] to prevent violence. Still, both sheriff's officers and city police were deployed at polling places, resulting in police officers arresting sheriff's deputies and vice versa.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nDespite (or perhaps because of) the large number of observers, [[ballot stuffing]] and re-voting was widespread. The day may have turned violent if not for the presence of the National Guard troops and a sideswipe from the [[Labor Day Hurricane of 1935]], which passed just west of Tampa during the afternoon and pelted the area with torrential rains and high winds.\n\nIn the end, the Tampa Election Board determined that Chancey had easily won re-election. They had reached these results by throwing out all ballots from 29 precincts due to \"fraudulent voting\". The Board may not have been the most impartial judge of the matter, however, as Chancey had appointed the members himself.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\n====Reforms====\n\n[[File:SenatorKefauver(D-TN).jpg|thumb|130px|Estes Kefauver]]\nThe era of rampant and open corruption came to a head in the early 1950s when the [[Kefauver hearings]], [[Estes Kefauver|Senator Estes Kefauver's]] traveling investigation of organized crime in America, came to town. Informants (including the retired Charlie Wall) came forward to make startling accusations of corruption throughout Tampa's power structure. The hearings were followed by misconduct trials of several local officials and the \"unsolved\" murders of some of the government informants (including the retired Charlie Wall).<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nThough most of the accused persons were acquitted or given light sentences, the trials helped to motivate Tampa to end the corruption and general sense of lawlessness which had prevailed for decades. Ethics and election reforms were passed, and the link between local government and organized crime weakened.\n\nHowever, major corruption was not eliminated entirely. In 1983, 3 out of the 5 members of the [[Hillsborough County, Florida#Government|Hillsborough County Commission]] were charged with accepting bribes. Unlike earlier crooked officials, however, these three were convicted of their crimes and sentenced to federal prison. This scandal resulted in another round of ethics reforms.<ref>{{cite web|last=Deeson |first=Mike |url=http://www.tampabays10.com/news/local/article.aspx?storyid=73000 |title=Public Corruption Arrests 25 years later |publisher=Tampabays10.com |date=1983-02-01 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref>\n\n===Athletics===\nThe first [[Sports in the Tampa Bay area|athletic]] venue in Tampa was [[Plant Field]], a race track and field built by Plant in 1899. In 1908 the YMCA opened.\n\n[[Curtis Hixon Hall]] opened in 1965, named for former mayor [[Curtis Hixon]], hosted basketball, boxing matches, and concerts.\n\nIn 1992, the [[Skatepark of Tampa]] was completed.\n\n====Football====\nIn 1926, [[Jim Thorpe]] led the barnstorming [[Tampa Cardinals]] against [[Red Grange]] and the [[Chicago Bears]] in the first professional football game in Tampa. The next venue after Plant Field was [[Phillips Field (Florida)|Phillips Field]], which hosted the University of Tampa football team, and was the site of the [[Cigar Bowl]].\n[[File:Tampa Stadium1.jpg|thumb|Tampa Stadium]]\nIn 1967, [[Tampa Stadium]] was built. Tampa was chosen for a team as part of the [[National Football League]]'s expansion after the AFL/NFL merger in 1970, and the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] had their first season in 1976, as members of the [[AFC West]] division. The following year, the Bucs were moved to the [[NFC Central]].\n\nThe team was the worst in the league until 1979, with a brief period of success from 1979 to 1982 with a defense led by [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Lee Roy Selmon]]. The team was again the worst in the league from 1983 to 1996, until they hired Hall of Fame coach [[Tony Dungy]] who pioneered the [[Tampa 2]] defense. In 1998, the team moved to [[Raymond James Stadium]].\n\nIn 2002, the Bucs moved to the [[NFC South]], and under head coach [[Jon Gruden]] the team won [[Super Bowl XXXVII]]. Tampa hosted [[Super Bowl]]s [[Super Bowl XVIII|XVIII]], [[Super Bowl XXV|XXV]], and [[Super Bowl XXXV|XXXV]]. Super Bowl [[Super Bowl XLIII|XLIII]] was hosted in Tampa, and [[Super Bowl LV|LV]] is scheduled to be. Tampa also hosts the [[Outback Bowl]]. There also used to be the [[Tampa Bay Bandits]] of the [[United States Football League]], coached by [[Steve Spurrier]], and the [[Tampa Bay Storm]] of the [[Arena Football League]]. \"The War on I-4\" refers to both the Tampa-Orlando rivalry in [[War on I-4 (arena football)|arena football]] and [[South Florida\u2013UCF rivalry|college football]].\n\n====Baseball====\nIn 1913, the [[Chicago Cubs]] moved their [[spring training]] site to the city of Tampa. The original [[minor league baseball]] team in Tampa was the [[Tampa Smokers]], established in 1919 as a charter member of the [[Florida State League]].\n[[File:Al Lopez Field entrance.JPG|thumb|Al Lopez Field]]\nThe [[New York Yankees]] train in Tampa at [[George M. Steinbrenner Field]], formerly Legends Field, which is the home of the [[Tampa Tarpons]]. [[Al Lopez Field]] used to be in West Tampa, named for Hall of Famer and Tampa native [[Al Lopez]]. Lopez's home is now the [[Tampa Baseball Museum]]. USF baseball used to play at [[Red McEwen Field]].\n\nIn 1998, Tampa got a [[Major League Baseball]] team, the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]], which plays at [[Tropicana Field]]. Hall of Famer [[Wade Boggs]] grew up in Tampa, as did [[Tony La Russa]], [[Lou Piniella]], [[Tino Martinez]], [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]], [[Doc Gooden]], and [[Gary Sheffield]].\n\nThe Devil Rays changed their name to the Rays in 2008. [[USF Baseball Stadium]] opened in 2011. .\n\n====Basketball====\nUSF basketball plays at the [[Yuengling Center]], formerly the Sun Dome.\n\n====Hockey====\n\nThe [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] of the [[National Hockey League]] formed in 1992, and plays at [[Amalie Arena]], formerly the Ice Palace and St. Pete Times Forum. The Lightning won the [[Stanley Cup]] in 2004.\n\n==== Soccer ====\nThere used to be the [[Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975\u201393)|Tampa Bay Rowdies]] and [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]].\n\n====Tennis====\n\nFrom 1979 to 1990, Tampa hosted the [[Eckerd Open]].\n\n====Golf====\n\nGarfield Rogers built [[Rogers Park, Tampa|Rogers Park]], the first [[golf course]] for blacks in Tampa. In 1974, the City of Tampa took over [[Babe Zaharias]]'s golf course in the [[Forest Hills (Tampa)|Forest Hills]] neighborhood.\n\n==21st century==\n[[The Stovall]] was built in 2001. The [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] programming language conference was held in Tampa in 2001. The [[Florida Museum of Photographic Arts]] also started in 2001. The American Victory Ship & Museum with [[SS American Victory]] started in 2003.  The [[MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheatre|Ford Amphitheater]], and [[Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Tampa]] in [[Tampa Indian Reservation]], also opened in 2004.\n\n===2002 plane crash===\nOn January 5, 2002, just four months after the [[September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]], 15-year-old amateur pilot [[Charles Bishop (pilot)|Charles Bishop]] [[2002 Tampa plane crash|crashed]] a [[Cessna]] plane into the Bank of America Plaza. Bishop died, but there were no other injuries (because the crash occurred on a Saturday, when few people were in the building). A [[suicide]] note found in the wreckage expressed support for [[Osama bin Laden]]. Bishop had been taking a [[Prescription drug|prescription]] medicine for [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] called [[Accutane]] that may have had the [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effect]] of [[clinical depression|depression]] or severe psychosis. His family later sued Hoffman-La Roche, the company that makes Accutane, for $70 million; however, an autopsy found no traces of the drug in the teenager's system.\n\n===2004 hurricane season===\nThe [[2004 Atlantic Hurricane Season]] was historically busy for all of Florida, including Tampa. Tampa's [[Climate of the Tampa Bay area|climate]] was affected by a record four hurricanes that year; [[Hurricane Frances|Frances]], [[Hurricane Jeanne|Jeanne]], [[Hurricane Charley|Charley]], and to a lesser extent, [[Hurricane Ivan|Ivan]].\n\nThe eyes of both Jeanne and Frances passed within a few miles of Tampa as they slashed their way across the state from the east coast. Charley was forecast to make a direct hit on Tampa Bay from the south (the worst-case scenario for local flooding). But the storm made a sudden and unexpected turn to the northeast and brought only tropical storm force winds to Tampa, devastating the [[Ft. Myers]]/[[Port Charlotte, Florida|Port Charlotte]] area instead. Ivan roared past the Florida gulf coast on its way to landfall near the [[Alabama]]/[[Florida]] border, passing near enough to bring high seas and stormy conditions to the Tampa area.\n\n===Downtown revitalization===\n[[File:Tampa Channelside.JPG|thumb|right|Luxury condos are rising in the former warehouse district of [[Channel District, Tampa, Florida|Channelside]], downtown Tampa]]\n\nFormer Tampa mayor [[Pam Iorio]] made the redevelopment of downtown a priority and focused on bringing residents into the decidedly non-residential area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/08/10/Floridian/Urban_culture_clash.shtml |title=Floridian: Urban culture clash |publisher=Sptimes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref> Several residential and mixed-development high-rises were planned and constructed. [[The Alagon on Bayshore]] was built in 2006. The [[Towers of Channelside]] and [[SkyPoint]] were finished in 2007. [[Element (Tampa)|Element]] was built in 2009.\n\n====Riverwalk====\nAnother of Mayor Iorio's initiatives was to improve the Tampa Riverwalk. The development plan expanded use of the land along the Hillsborough River in downtown, where Tampa was first established. The [[Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park]] opened in 2010, next to the Riverwalk and the former site of Curtis Hixon Hall. [[Water Works Park (Tampa, Florida)|Water Works Park]] opened in 2014.\n\n=====Museums=====\nSeveral museums were part of the plan, including the Florida Museum of Photographic Arts, which relocated in 2006, the [[Tampa Bay History Center]], which began in 2009; the Tampa Children's Museum, which relocated in 2010 and was renamed the Glazer Children's Museum, the Tampa Museum of Art, which relocated in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A52700 |title=Creative Loafing Tampa &#124; News &#124; Downtowns On The Verge |publisher=Tampa.creativeloafing.com |accessdate=2010-05-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423004825/http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A52700 |archivedate=2009-04-23 }}</ref>\n\nTampa Mayor [[Bob Buckhorn]] has continued the development and redevelopment focused work.

The outpost brought a small population of civilians to the area, and the town of Tampa was first incorporated in 1855.\n\nGrowth came slowly as poor transportation links, conflicts with the [[Seminole|Seminole tribe]], and repeated outbreaks of [[yellow fever]] made development difficult. The [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] caused the city government to disincorporate for over a decade.\n\nIn the 1880s the construction of the first [[railroad]] links laid by [[Henry B. Plant]] brought the development of thriving [[cigar]] and [[Phosphate mining in the United States|phosphate]] industries. The founding of the cigar-centered [[Neighborhoods in Tampa, Florida|neighborhood]] of [[Ybor City]] in 1885 brought an influx of [[Cubans]], [[Spaniards]], [[Italians]], and other immigrants. Tampa's population jumped from less than 800 residents in 1880 to over 15,000 in 1900, making it one of the largest cities in Florida.\n\nBy the 20th century Tampa emerged as a modern financial, trade, and commercial hub. It saw the start of the [[Gasparilla Pirate Festival]] and pioneering aviator [[Tony Jannus]] captaining the inaugural flight of the [[St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line]], the world's first commercial [[passenger airline]]. It also saw the rise of organized crime.\n\nThe number of residents exceeded 100,000 during the 1930s, 250,000 during the 1950s, and 300,000 during the 1990s. The land area of Tampa also grew, most notably when the city annexed the neighboring communities of [[West Tampa]] in 1925, [[Sulphur Springs, Tampa, Florida|Sulphur Springs]] and [[Palma Ceia, Tampa, Florida|Palma Ceia]] in 1953, [[Port Tampa]] in 1961, and [[New Tampa]] in 1988. Most of the land added to Tampa over the years was unincorporated. Five incorporated municipalities{{disputed inline|date=June 2014}} have been consolidated into Tampa: North Tampa, Ybor City, Fort Brooke, West Tampa, and Port Tampa.<ref name=\"ws1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/US_Mayors2.html|title=Mayors of U.S. Cities M-W|author=Ben Cahoon|date=|publisher=Worldstatesmen.org|accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Florida History Navbar}}\nThere is some dispute as to the origin and meaning of the name \"Tampa\". It is believed to mean \"sticks of fire\" in the language of the [[Calusa]], an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] tribe that once lived south of the area. This may relate to the high concentration of [[lightning]] strikes that west central Florida receives every year during the summer months.\n\nOther historians claim the name refers to \"the place to gather sticks\". [[Toponymy|Toponymist]] [[George R. Stewart]] writes that the name was the result of a miscommunication between the Spanish and the Indians, the Indian word being \"itimpi\", meaning simply \"near it\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Stewart|2008|page= 231}}</ref> Another source relates Tampa comes from a Seminole word for wood.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.hcplc.org/digital/collection/p15391coll2/id/1247/rec/8|title=Page 1|website=digitalcollections.hcplc.org}}</ref>\n\nThe name first appears in the memoir of [[Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda]] from 1575, who had spent 17 years as a Calusa captive. He calls it \"Tanpa\" and describes it as an important Calusa town.\n\nWhile \"Tanpa\" may be the basis for the modern name \"Tampa\", [[archaeologist]] Jerald Milanich places the Calusa village of Tanpa at the mouth of [[Charlotte Harbor (estuary)|Charlotte Harbor]] near current day [[Pineland, Florida|Pineland]]. Map maker [[Bernard Romans]] found certain difficulties in translating earlier Spanish-era maps of Florida for English use and may have accidentally transferred the name north to Tampa Bay, the next large inlet up the west coast of Florida.<ref>{{Harvnb|Milanich|1995|page=40}}</ref>\n\n==Early history==\n{{see also|History of Florida}}\n\n[[File:TocobagaTerritory.GIF|thumb|200px|Approximate extent of [[Tocobaga]] culture]]\n\n===Indigenous population===\n{{see also|Tocobaga|Pohoy|Indigenous peoples of Florida}}\n\nArcheological evidence indicates that the shores of Tampa Bay have been inhabited for thousands of years. Artifacts suggest that early inhabitants of the region relied on the sea for most of their resources, and a vast majority of inhabited sites have been found on or near the shoreline.\n\nThe [[Manasota culture]] is the earliest documented group, spanning from about 500 B.C. until about 700 A.D., by which time it had evolved into the [[Safety Harbor culture]]. It loosely organized into three or four chiefdoms on the shores of the bay.\n\nThe [[Tocobaga]]'s principal town was located at the northern end of Old Tampa Bay near today's [[Safety Harbor, Florida|Safety Harbor]] in [[Pinellas County]]. [[Uzita (Florida)|Uzita]] controlled the south shore of Tampa Bay, from the [[Little Manatee River]] to [[Sarasota Bay]]. [[Mocoso]] was on the east side of Tampa Bay, on the [[Alafia River]] and, possibly, the Hillsborough River. There may have been a fourth independent chiefdom, the [[Pohoy]] or Capaloey, centered on Hillsborough Bay near today's downtown and [[Port of Tampa|port]], possibly extending to the Hillsborough River.<ref>Milanich 1989: 299</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Milanich|1995|pages=28, 73, 103\u2013104, 110}}</ref>\n\nThese small coastal villages contained a temple mound, a central plaza, and one or more [[midden|shell middens]], which were trash heaps from which much archeological information has been obtained.<ref>Bullen, Ripley P.

The ill-fated [[Narv\u00e1ez Expedition]] landed near present-day Tampa with the intention of starting a colony. After being told by the natives of wealthier cultures to the north, they abandoned their camp after only a week to begin a long but futile search for non-existent riches. A dozen years later, a surviving member of the expedition named Juan Ortiz was rescued by [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]]'s expedition.<ref name=\"fwp286\" /><ref>[http://fcit.usf.edu/FLORIDA/docs/d/desoto.htm ''Floripedia'' \"De Soto, Hernando\"] \u2013 URL retrieved January 30, 2007</ref>\n\nDe Soto conducted a peace treaty with the Tocobaga, and a short-lived Spanish outpost was established. However, this was abandoned when it became clear that there was no [[gold]] in the area, that the local Indians were not interested in converting to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], and that they were too skilled as warriors to easily conquer.\n\nThough they successfully avoided being conquered by guns, the indigenous peoples had little defense against germs. [[Columbian exchange #disease|Diseases introduced by European contact]] would decimate the native population in the ensuing decades,<ref>Hann, John H. (2003). ''Indians of Central and South Florida: 1513\u20131763''. University Press of Florida. {{ISBN|0-8130-2645-8}}</ref> leading to the near-total collapse of every established culture across peninsular Florida. Between this depopulation and the indifference of its colonial owners, the Tampa Bay area would be virtually uninhabited for the next 200+ years.\n\n====English rule====\n\n[[File:1stMarquessOfDownshire.jpg|thumb|140px|Lord Hillsborough]]\nGreat Britain acquired Florida in 1763 as part of the treaty which ended the [[French and Indian War]] ([[Seven Years' War]]). The bay was rechristened \"Hillsborough Bay\" after [[Lord Hillsborough]], the then-[[Secretary of State for the Colonies]]. Though the name \"Tampa Bay\" was later restored, the English period is still reflected in the names of Hillsborough river and county. Like Spain, Britain was much more concerned with the strategically important Atlantic coast of Florida (especially [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]]) than other parts of the territory and did not attempt to found settlements along the Gulf coast.\n\nHowever, the Tampa Bay area did have a few residents: Indians and [[Cubans|Cuban]] fishermen who lived in a seasonal encampment at the mouth of [[Spanish Town Creek]], a freshwater stream that once ran through today's [[Hyde Park (Tampa)|Hyde Park neighborhood]] to [[Bayshore Boulevard]]. A handful of these people may have stayed year round, but the majority spent a few months catching and smoking fish (especially [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]]) from the teeming waters of the bay, then returned to sell them in Cuba.<ref>{{cite web|author=Thomas Angarano |url=http://www.webcoast.com/pinellas.htm |title=About Tampa Bay \u2013 Pinellas County History |publisher=Webcoast.com |date=1915-05-27 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref>\n\nSpain regained control of Florida in 1783 as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] at the end of the [[American Revolution]]. Once again, the Florida's Gulf Coast was not a vital concern to its European owner.\n\n===Florida becomes a US territory===\nSince the mid-1700s, people from various native Indian tribes, especially [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creeks]] from Georgia, had fled to largely uninhabited Florida to distance themselves from encroaching settlers in their homelands. They were joined by escaped [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] from neighboring colonies / states, and these disparate refugees developed a new [[Seminole]] culture.\n\n== Fort Brooke and the Seminole Wars ==\n[[File:Charles Willson Peale - portrait of Andrew Jackson, 1819.jpg|thumb|130px|Andrew Jackson, 1819]]\n\nAfter the [[War of 1812]], [[Andrew Jackson]] invaded Florida kicking off the [[First Seminole War]].\nIn 1821, the United States [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty|purchased Florida from Spain]], mainly to end (alleged) cross-frontier Indians raids and to eliminate the southern refuge for slaves.

The U.S. government then built a series of forts and trading posts throughout the territory to enforce the provisions of the treaty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fcit.usf.edu/florida/lessons/sem_war/sem_war1.htm|title=The Seminole Wars|website=fcit.usf.edu}}</ref>\n\nAs part of this effort, [[Fort Brooke]] was established on January 10, 1824 by Colonels [[George Mercer Brooke]] and [[James Gadsden]] at the mouth of the Hillsborough River on Tampa Bay, just about where today's [[Tampa Convention Center]] sits downtown. The site was marked by a huge [[hickory tree]] set atop an ancient [[Indian mound]] most likely built by the Tocobaga centuries before.[[File:Fort Brooke.jpg|thumb|Barracks and tents at Fort Brooke in Tampa Bay, c. 1835|alt=|left]]Colonel Brooke, the outpost's first commander, directed his troops to clear the area for the construction of a [[Fortification|wooden fort]] and support buildings, but ordered that several ancient [[live oak]] trees inside the encampment be spared to provide shade and cheer.<ref name=\"Brown, Cantor\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1999}}</ref>  On January 22, 1824, the post was officially named [[Fort Brooke]].<ref>{{cite web|author=museumofcigars.com |url=http://www.museumofcigars.com/fort-brooke.htm |title=fort brooke |publisher=Museumofcigars.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref> [[John Mercer Brooke]] was born there.

Dade]]  while they were on their way from Fort Brooke to Fort King (near present-day [[Ocala]]) in a rout that was dubbed the [[Dade Massacre]], triggering the [[Second Seminole War]]. \n\nDuring the war, Fort Brooke first served as a refuge for settlers, then as a vital military depot and staging area. After almost seven years of vicious fighting, the war was over and the Seminoles were forced away from the Tampa region, and the tiny village began a period of slow growth. \n\n==== Third Seminole War ====\n[[File:Billy bowlegs harpers.jpg|thumb|130px|Seminole Billy Bowlegs]]\nSeminole chief [[Billy Bowlegs]] attacked the whites at Fort Myers in late 1855 triggering the [[Third Seminole War]]. When the news of the attack reached Tampa, the men of the city elected militia officers and organized companies. The newly formed militia marched to the Peace River valley, recruited more men, and manned some forts along the river.\n\n==Statehood to Civil War==\nThe Territory of Florida had grown enough by 1845 to become the 27th state. Pioneer families of Tampa during the antebellum period migrated largely from Northern Florida, Central Florida, Georgia, Alabama and the Carolinas, along with their slaves, excepting a few settlers from Ireland, France, Spain and the North.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/bluebooktampaflo00haze/bluebooktampaflo00haze_djvu.txt|title=The Blue Book and History of Pioneers|last1=Brown-Hazen|first1=Pauline|date=1914|publisher=Tribune Publishing Company|edition=1st|location=Tampa, Florida|pages=4\u201331|oclc=19034562}}</ref>  John Parker was the town's first [[Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office|sheriff]].

Ybor City and North Tampa were annexed into Tampa in 1887.<ref name=\"ws1\" />\n\nThese changes combined to bring sudden prosperity and explosive growth \u2013 Tampa's population jumped from less than 800 residents in 1880 to over 15,000 in 1900, making it one of the largest cities in Florida.\n\nW.

The Consumers Electric Light and Street Railway Company bought out the Tampa Street Railway Company in 1894. The company also acquired control of the Tampa and Palmetto Beach Rail Company, becoming the sole streetcar operator in Tampa. The [[TECO Energy|Tampa Electric Company]] acquired control of the Consumers Electric Light and Street Railway Company in 1899.\n\nThe Tampa Electric Company acquired 21 miles (34&nbsp;km) of streetcar track. After acquiring the Tampa and Sulphur Springs Traction Company in 1913, Tampa Electric had almost 50 miles (80&nbsp;km) of track, increasing to 53 miles (85&nbsp;km) by 1926. That year the Tampa Electric system carried almost 24 million passengers. The streetcar system in Tampa was shut down after World War II.\n\nStreetcars returned to Tampa in 2002, when the initial 2.4&nbsp;mi (3.86&nbsp;km) long heritage line was opened, operated by the [[Hillsborough Area Regional Transit|transit authority]].\n\n===Cigar industry===\n\n[[File:Seal of Tampa, Florida.svg|thumb|120px|Seal of Tampa]]\n\nThe new railroad link attracted another industry which would finally make Tampa prosper. In 1885, the Tampa Board of Trade, especially W. C. Brown and W. B. Henderson, helped broker a land deal with [[Vicente Martinez Ybor]], Ignacio Haya, and [[Gavino Gutierrez]] to move their [[cigar]] manufacturing operations to Tampa from [[Key West]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Grismer|1950|pages=182\u2013183}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://ucf.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/ucf%3A22405/datastream/OBJ/view/The_Florida_historical_quarterly.pdf|journal=The Florida Historical Quarterly|volume=45|title=The Historical Beginnings of Ybor City and Modern Tampa|author=Durward Long|page=34}}</ref>\n\nGutierrez had first come to Tampa in 1884 due to a false rumor about the ability to find [[guava]] trees.{{refn|group=n|In the 1970s columnist Steve Otto gave Tampa the nickname [[The Big Guava]], mimicking New York's \"[[Big Apple]]\".  Halloween in Ybor City is known as [[Guavaween]].}} Ybor had been attracted by Tampa's warm and humid climate, which kept [[tobacco]] fresh and workable, and its new transportation links. Close proximity (and Henry Plant's [[steamship]]s) made import of fine Cuban tobacco easy by sea, and Plant's railroad made shipment of finished cigars to the rest of the US market easy by land. This relationship is acknowledged in the [[Seal of Tampa]], which depicts Plant's steamship ''Mascotte'', a vessel that carried thousands of immigrants and tons of tobacco to Tampa.\n\n====Ybor City====\n{{see also|History of Ybor City}}\n[[File:El Pasaje Ybor.jpg|thumb|[[El Pasaje]], one of the first buildings in Ybor City]]\n\nYbor built the [[Ybor Factory Building]] and [[El Pasaje]] and Ybor City (as the settlement was dubbed) quickly made Tampa a major cigar production center. Ybor City began as a separate [[municipality]], but, seeing the potential for greatly increased tax rolls, the city of Tampa annexed the bustling community in 1886.\n\nSince Tampa was still a small town at the time (population less than 5,000), Ybor built hundreds of small houses around his factory to accommodate the immediate influx of thousands of Cuban and Spanish cigar workers. Other cigar manufacturers soon moved in, such as [[Cuesta-Rey]]. In 1896, Ybor built a large [[Florida Brewing Company building|brewery]], the tallest building in the [[Ybor City Historic District|historic district]].\n\n=====Immigrants=====\n\n====== Cubans ======\n[[File:Jose Marti in Ybor City.jpg|thumb|Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed with cigar factory workers in Ybor City, 1893.]]In the early 1890s, [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed]] was invited to Ybor City to collect funding for the cause of Cuban independence, which he did alongside [[Paulina Pedroso]].\n\n====== Spaniards ======\nIn the 1890s, Las Novedades, Tampa's oldest restaurant, opened.<ref>http://www.tampapix.com/lasnovedades.htm</ref>\n\n====== Italians ======\nStarting in the late 1880s, many Italian and a few eastern European Jewish immigrants also arrived.

In the case of Tampa, the hotel would be such a boon that the city council readily agreed to several concessions to Plant, including low, fixed-rate taxes for his hotel and a promise that the city would build a bridge over the Hillsborough River at Lafayette Street (now [[John F.

The [[Florida Aquarium]] opened in 1995.\n\n=== High rises ===\n[[File:Floridian Hotel, Tampa FL.JPG|thumb|160px|Hotel Floridan]]Tampa's first high rise, the [[Citizens Bank Building (Tampa, Florida)|Citizens Bank Building]] was built in 1913 by James. [[Tampa City Hall|City Hall]] was built in 1915 by [[Franklin O. Adams]]. In 1927, the [[Floridan Palace Hotel|Hotel Floridan]] opened.  The [[Franklin Exchange Building]] was constructed in 1966.\n\nThe [[Park Tower (Tampa, Florida)|Park Tower]] (opened in 1973) was the city's only substantial skyscraper (460 feet/36 stories) constructed until the building boom of the 1980s. [[One Tampa City Center]] and the [[Fifth Third Center (Tampa)|Fifth Third Center]] opened in 1981. [[One Mack-Cali Center]] was built in 1983. The [[Wells Fargo Center (Tampa)|Wells Fargo Center]] was completed in 1985. The [[Bank of America Plaza (Tampa)|Bank of America Plaza]] was completed in 1986. The [[Rivergate Tower]] opened in 1988.\n\nIn 1992, the [[SunTrust Financial Centre]] and [[100 North Tampa]], Tampa's [[List of tallest buildings in Tampa|tallest building]], went up. The [[Tampa Marriott Waterside]], the area's largest hotel, was completed in 2000.\n\n=== Segregation ===\nSegregation continued into the 20th century. Most blacks lived in \"the Scrub\" (Tampa's [[Central Avenue (Tampa, Florida)|Central Avenue]] district), West Tampa, Ybor City, [[Dobyville]], and College Hill. According to Benjamin Mays' report ''A Study of Negro Life in Tampa'', the black population grew from 4,383 in 1900 to 23,323 in 1927. Businessman [[Moses White (activist)|Moses White]] was known as the \"Mayor of Central Avenue\". [[Ole Pete]] was supposed to live in Port Tampa.\n[[File:Jackson Rooming House Tampa.jpg|thumb|160px|Jackson Rooming House]]\n\nThe [[Jackson Rooming House]], the area's only boarding house for blacks,  was built in the Scrub in 1901.  In 1908, [[Clara C. Frye]] opened a hospital for black patients in her home, assisted by Mack Winton. Her dining room table was the [[operating table]].\n\nA building was secured in 1923 and was purchased by the City of Tampa in 1928. The Clara Frye Memorial Hospital that existed in West Tampa from 1938 to 1967 was named after her. The Tampa Municipal Hospital did not admit black patients until the 1950s.\n\nIn 1922, [[Garfield Devoe Rogers Sr.]] helped start the Central Life Insurance Company, which sold policies to blacks. In 1938, [[Blanche Armwood]] became the first black woman in Florida to graduate from an accredited law school. Black Cuban Francisco Rodriguez became a lawyer in 1951. In 1952, the NAACP moved its state headquarters to Tampa, and educator Edward Daniel Davis was president of Central Life Insurance Company.\n\nIn 1919, William W. Andrews opened the ''[[Florida Sentinel]]'' newspaper office in Jacksonville. The office was closed during the Depression. In 1945, General Andrews's son, C. Blythe Andrews, re-opened the ''Florida Sentinel'' on Central Avenue. In 1959, he bought the ''Tampa Bulletin'' newspaper, and merged the two newspapers to make the ''Florida Sentinel Bulletin''. In 1962, the newspaper office was moved to Ybor City.<ref>[http://www.hmdb.org/PhotoFullSize.asp?PhotoID=67579 Florida Sentinel Bulletin Marker] (photo).</ref> The [[C. Blythe Andrews Jr. Public Library]] was named in his honor.\n\n[[Cody Fowler]] formed the Bi-Racial Commission in 1959. His mother Maude helped develop Temple Terrace and is the namesake of [[Florida State Road 582|Fowler Avenue]].{{refn|group=n|Cody's [[Cody Fowler House|house]] is in Temple Terrace.}}\n\n=== Women ===\nIn 1900, the Tampa Woman's Club formed.<ref>https://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1164&context=sunlandtribune</ref> Kate V. Jackson founded the Tampa Civic Association in 1911. In 1923, Elizabeth Dortsch Barnard was the town's first female postmaster.  In 1926, the [[Junior League]] of Tampa was founded.\n\n===Mafia===\n[[File:Bolita balls.jpg|right|thumb|200px| A set of bolita balls on display at the Ybor City State Museum.]]\nBeginning in the late 19th century, illegal [[bolita]] lotteries were very popular among the Tampa working classes, especially in Ybor City.\n\n==== Charlie Wall ====\nIn the early 1920s, this small-time operation was taken over by [[Charlie Wall]], whose father was the town's former mayor and a pioneer in yellow fever research, [[John Perry Wall]], and whose mother was a McKay.\n\nWall's operations thrived as he expanded them to include liquor distribution and speakeasies (this was the era of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]) and prostitution. Other smaller [[organized crime]] groups tried to muscle in on the action, and long-simmering rivalries were kindled.\n\nThese organizations were able to operate openly because of kick-backs and bribes to key local politicians and law enforcement officials. Wall was well-connected, and he used those connections to keep his businesses running and put down his competition. Tampa's political elite, which had held an inconsistent but mostly ambivalent attitude toward organized crime, quietly became de facto partners.\n\n==== Trafficantes and the Era of Blood ====\n{{see also|Trafficante crime family}}\nWhile Charlie Wall was Tampa's first major crime boss, various factions vied for control of the area in later years. Ongoing power struggles resulted in regular organized-crime related \"unsolved\" murders of crime-connected figures in what became known as the \"Era of Blood\". To protect their interests (and keep gangland killings unsolved), crime bosses regularly kept local officials \u2013 from state attorneys to top law enforcement personnel and even mayors \u2013 on the payroll.<ref>{{cite web|last=Deitche |first=Scott |url=http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/the_mob/Content?oid=317 |title=Creative Loafing Tampa &#124; News &#124; Cover &#124; The Mob |publisher=Tampa.creativeloafing.com |accessdate=2010-05-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113104959/http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/the_mob/Content?oid=317 |archivedate=2009-01-13 }}</ref>\n[[File:Santo Trafficante, Jr.jpg|thumb|130px|Santo Trafficante, Jr. mugshot]]\nThe first Italian gang in the Tampa Bay area was created by the Sicilian [[Ignacio Antinori]] in 1925.  By the late 1940s, most of the area's crime organizations were under the control of [[made man|mafioso]] [[Santo Trafficante, Sr.]] and his faction. After his death in 1954 from [[cancer]], control passed to his son [[Santo Trafficante, Jr.]], who established alliances with families in New York City and extended his power throughout Florida and into [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]]-era [[Cuba]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Deitche |first=Scott |url=http://www.weeklyplanet.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A317 |title=Creative Loafing Tampa |publisher=Weeklyplanet.com |accessdate=2010-05-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060315022914/http://www.weeklyplanet.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A317 |archivedate=2006-03-15 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanmafia.com/Feature_Articles_101.html |title=Feature Articles 101 |publisher=AmericanMafia.com |accessdate=2010-05-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206141849/http://www.americanmafia.com/Feature_Articles_101.html |archivedate=2010-02-06 }}</ref>\n\n====Election controversies====\nFrom the early 1930s until the early 1950s, every municipal election was tainted by electoral abnormalities, most with alleged mob connections. The first widespread example was Tampa's mayoral election of 1931, when over 100 people were arrested for \"cheating at the polls\". Most were supporters of the winning candidate, Robert E. Lee Chancey, who his opponents claimed had close ties to Tampa's \"underworld\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{Harvnb|Kerstein|2001}}</ref> After the election, all of the charges were either reduced or dropped altogether. Many of those involved had been on the city payroll at the time of their arrest, and most remained there.\n \nThe situation was even more chaotic during the next election cycle in 1935. This started before election day when Tampa's chief of police (who supported the incumbent mayor) and the Hillsborough County Sheriff (who supported the challenger) both claimed to be the proper authority to monitor the actual voting. Anticipating trouble, [[David Sholtz|Florida Governor Sholtz]] mobilized the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] to prevent violence. Still, both sheriff's officers and city police were deployed at polling places, resulting in police officers arresting sheriff's deputies and vice versa.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nDespite (or perhaps because of) the large number of observers, [[ballot stuffing]] and re-voting was widespread. The day may have turned violent if not for the presence of the National Guard troops and a sideswipe from the [[Labor Day Hurricane of 1935]], which passed just west of Tampa during the afternoon and pelted the area with torrential rains and high winds.\n\nIn the end, the Tampa Election Board determined that Chancey had easily won re-election. They had reached these results by throwing out all ballots from 29 precincts due to \"fraudulent voting\". The Board may not have been the most impartial judge of the matter, however, as Chancey had appointed the members himself.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\n====Reforms====\n\n[[File:SenatorKefauver(D-TN).jpg|thumb|130px|Estes Kefauver]]\nThe era of rampant and open corruption came to a head in the early 1950s when the [[Kefauver hearings]], [[Estes Kefauver|Senator Estes Kefauver's]] traveling investigation of organized crime in America, came to town. Informants (including the retired Charlie Wall) came forward to make startling accusations of corruption throughout Tampa's power structure. The hearings were followed by misconduct trials of several local officials and the \"unsolved\" murders of some of the government informants (including the retired Charlie Wall).<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nThough most of the accused persons were acquitted or given light sentences, the trials helped to motivate Tampa to end the corruption and general sense of lawlessness which had prevailed for decades. Ethics and election reforms were passed, and the link between local government and organized crime weakened.\n\nHowever, major corruption was not eliminated entirely. In 1983, 3 out of the 5 members of the [[Hillsborough County, Florida#Government|Hillsborough County Commission]] were charged with accepting bribes. Unlike earlier crooked officials, however, these three were convicted of their crimes and sentenced to federal prison. This scandal resulted in another round of ethics reforms.<ref>{{cite web|last=Deeson |first=Mike |url=http://www.tampabays10.com/news/local/article.aspx?storyid=73000 |title=Public Corruption Arrests 25 years later |publisher=Tampabays10.com |date=1983-02-01 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref>\n\n===Athletics===\nThe first [[Sports in the Tampa Bay area|athletic]] venue in Tampa was [[Plant Field]], a race track and field built by Plant in 1899. In 1908 the YMCA opened.\n\n[[Curtis Hixon Hall]] opened in 1965, named for former mayor [[Curtis Hixon]], hosted basketball, boxing matches, and concerts.\n\nIn 1992, the [[Skatepark of Tampa]] was completed.\n\n====Football====\nIn 1926, [[Jim Thorpe]] led the barnstorming [[Tampa Cardinals]] against [[Red Grange]] and the [[Chicago Bears]] in the first professional football game in Tampa. The next venue after Plant Field was [[Phillips Field (Florida)|Phillips Field]], which hosted the University of Tampa football team, and was the site of the [[Cigar Bowl]].\n[[File:Tampa Stadium1.jpg|thumb|Tampa Stadium]]\nIn 1967, [[Tampa Stadium]] was built. Tampa was chosen for a team as part of the [[National Football League]]'s expansion after the AFL/NFL merger in 1970, and the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] had their first season in 1976, as members of the [[AFC West]] division. The following year, the Bucs were moved to the [[NFC Central]].\n\nThe team was the worst in the league until 1979, with a brief period of success from 1979 to 1982 with a defense led by [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Lee Roy Selmon]]. The team was again the worst in the league from 1983 to 1996, until they hired Hall of Fame coach [[Tony Dungy]] who pioneered the [[Tampa 2]] defense. In 1998, the team moved to [[Raymond James Stadium]].\n\nIn 2002, the Bucs moved to the [[NFC South]], and under head coach [[Jon Gruden]] the team won [[Super Bowl XXXVII]]. Tampa hosted [[Super Bowl]]s [[Super Bowl XVIII|XVIII]], [[Super Bowl XXV|XXV]], and [[Super Bowl XXXV|XXXV]]. Super Bowl [[Super Bowl XLIII|XLIII]] was hosted in Tampa, and [[Super Bowl LV|LV]] is scheduled to be. Tampa also hosts the [[Outback Bowl]]. There also used to be the [[Tampa Bay Bandits]] of the [[United States Football League]], coached by [[Steve Spurrier]], and the [[Tampa Bay Storm]] of the [[Arena Football League]]. \"The War on I-4\" refers to both the Tampa-Orlando rivalry in [[War on I-4 (arena football)|arena football]] and [[South Florida\u2013UCF rivalry|college football]].\n\n====Baseball====\nIn 1913, the [[Chicago Cubs]] moved their [[spring training]] site to the city of Tampa. The original [[minor league baseball]] team in Tampa was the [[Tampa Smokers]], established in 1919 as a charter member of the [[Florida State League]].\n[[File:Al Lopez Field entrance.JPG|thumb|Al Lopez Field]]\nThe [[New York Yankees]] train in Tampa at [[George M. Steinbrenner Field]], formerly Legends Field, which is the home of the [[Tampa Tarpons]]. [[Al Lopez Field]] used to be in West Tampa, named for Hall of Famer and Tampa native [[Al Lopez]]. Lopez's home is now the [[Tampa Baseball Museum]]. USF baseball used to play at [[Red McEwen Field]].\n\nIn 1998, Tampa got a [[Major League Baseball]] team, the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]], which plays at [[Tropicana Field]]. Hall of Famer [[Wade Boggs]] grew up in Tampa, as did [[Tony La Russa]], [[Lou Piniella]], [[Tino Martinez]], [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]], [[Doc Gooden]], and [[Gary Sheffield]].\n\nThe Devil Rays changed their name to the Rays in 2008. [[USF Baseball Stadium]] opened in 2011. .\n\n====Basketball====\nUSF basketball plays at the [[Yuengling Center]], formerly the Sun Dome.\n\n====Hockey====\n\nThe [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] of the [[National Hockey League]] formed in 1992, and plays at [[Amalie Arena]], formerly the Ice Palace and St. Pete Times Forum. The Lightning won the [[Stanley Cup]] in 2004.\n\n==== Soccer ====\nThere used to be the [[Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975\u201393)|Tampa Bay Rowdies]] and [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]].\n\n====Tennis====\n\nFrom 1979 to 1990, Tampa hosted the [[Eckerd Open]].\n\n====Golf====\n\nGarfield Rogers built [[Rogers Park, Tampa|Rogers Park]], the first [[golf course]] for blacks in Tampa. In 1974, the City of Tampa took over [[Babe Zaharias]]'s golf course in the [[Forest Hills (Tampa)|Forest Hills]] neighborhood.\n\n==21st century==\n[[The Stovall]] was built in 2001. The [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] programming language conference was held in Tampa in 2001. The [[Florida Museum of Photographic Arts]] also started in 2001. The American Victory Ship & Museum with [[SS American Victory]] started in 2003.  The [[MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheatre|Ford Amphitheater]], and [[Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Tampa]] in [[Tampa Indian Reservation]], also opened in 2004.\n\n===2002 plane crash===\nOn January 5, 2002, just four months after the [[September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]], 15-year-old amateur pilot [[Charles Bishop (pilot)|Charles Bishop]] [[2002 Tampa plane crash|crashed]] a [[Cessna]] plane into the Bank of America Plaza. Bishop died, but there were no other injuries (because the crash occurred on a Saturday, when few people were in the building). A [[suicide]] note found in the wreckage expressed support for [[Osama bin Laden]]. Bishop had been taking a [[Prescription drug|prescription]] medicine for [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] called [[Accutane]] that may have had the [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effect]] of [[clinical depression|depression]] or severe psychosis. His family later sued Hoffman-La Roche, the company that makes Accutane, for $70 million; however, an autopsy found no traces of the drug in the teenager's system.\n\n===2004 hurricane season===\nThe [[2004 Atlantic Hurricane Season]] was historically busy for all of Florida, including Tampa. Tampa's [[Climate of the Tampa Bay area|climate]] was affected by a record four hurricanes that year; [[Hurricane Frances|Frances]], [[Hurricane Jeanne|Jeanne]], [[Hurricane Charley|Charley]], and to a lesser extent, [[Hurricane Ivan|Ivan]].\n\nThe eyes of both Jeanne and Frances passed within a few miles of Tampa as they slashed their way across the state from the east coast. Charley was forecast to make a direct hit on Tampa Bay from the south (the worst-case scenario for local flooding). But the storm made a sudden and unexpected turn to the northeast and brought only tropical storm force winds to Tampa, devastating the [[Ft. Myers]]/[[Port Charlotte, Florida|Port Charlotte]] area instead. Ivan roared past the Florida gulf coast on its way to landfall near the [[Alabama]]/[[Florida]] border, passing near enough to bring high seas and stormy conditions to the Tampa area.\n\n===Downtown revitalization===\n[[File:Tampa Channelside.JPG|thumb|right|Luxury condos are rising in the former warehouse district of [[Channel District, Tampa, Florida|Channelside]], downtown Tampa]]\n\nFormer Tampa mayor [[Pam Iorio]] made the redevelopment of downtown a priority and focused on bringing residents into the decidedly non-residential area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/08/10/Floridian/Urban_culture_clash.shtml |title=Floridian: Urban culture clash |publisher=Sptimes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref> Several residential and mixed-development high-rises were planned and constructed. [[The Alagon on Bayshore]] was built in 2006. The [[Towers of Channelside]] and [[SkyPoint]] were finished in 2007. [[Element (Tampa)|Element]] was built in 2009.\n\n====Riverwalk====\nAnother of Mayor Iorio's initiatives was to improve the Tampa Riverwalk. The development plan expanded use of the land along the Hillsborough River in downtown, where Tampa was first established. The [[Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park]] opened in 2010, next to the Riverwalk and the former site of Curtis Hixon Hall. [[Water Works Park (Tampa, Florida)|Water Works Park]] opened in 2014.\n\n=====Museums=====\nSeveral museums were part of the plan, including the Florida Museum of Photographic Arts, which relocated in 2006, the [[Tampa Bay History Center]], which began in 2009; the Tampa Children's Museum, which relocated in 2010 and was renamed the Glazer Children's Museum, the Tampa Museum of Art, which relocated in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A52700 |title=Creative Loafing Tampa &#124; News &#124; Downtowns On The Verge |publisher=Tampa.creativeloafing.com |accessdate=2010-05-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423004825/http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A52700 |archivedate=2009-04-23 }}</ref>\n\nTampa Mayor [[Bob Buckhorn]] has continued the development and redevelopment focused work.

Artdink ported the A-Train III along with the editor to Windows 95, and published both titles as a package as the 3rd ARTDINK BEST CHOICE title in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nThe game puts players in command of a [[Rail transport|railway]] company. There are no rival companies; the player controls the only one in the [[city]] and the game is resultingly fairly open-ended. A-Train III is the first game in the series to make use of [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|near-isometric]] [[Axonometric projection#Three types of axonometric projections|dimetric projection]] to present the city, similar to Maxis's later ''[[SimCity 2000]]''.<ref name=\"pcmuseum\">[http://www.pcmuseum.ca/details.asp?id=40218&type=software A-Train], Personal Computer Museum</ref> There are two types of transport that the player's company can take: passengers or building materials. The former is more likely to be profitable, but building materials allow the city to grow. Wherever the building materials are delivered, they can be taken and used to construct buildings for the city. These start with [[house]]s, but eventually, as an area grows, roads, and shops and other buildings are built. These can provide extra revenue for a passenger service, but also allowing the city to develop and grow can be seen as a goal in itself.  As well as the buildings built by the computer, in response to the materials being present, the player can construct their own buildings, such as [[ski resort]]s and [[hotel]]s, and make profits from them if the conditions are right.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n'''''A.III.

A train can be controlled throughout the day (05:00-17:00) while building new tracks and stations. Nighttime activities (17:00-05:00) involve changing train schedules to better suit the needs of the player's growing mass transportation hub. New [[Real estate development|developments]] will spring up around the tracks and stations. This permits the player to increase the amount of money that can earn; resulting in the increased ability to build railroad tracks and stations for the growing city.

There are no rival companies; the player controls the only one in the [[city]] and the game is resultingly fairly open-ended.

The former is more likely to be profitable, but building materials allow the city to grow. Wherever the building materials are delivered, they can be taken and used to construct buildings for the city. These start with [[house]]s, but eventually, as an area grows, roads, and shops and other buildings are built. These can provide extra revenue for a passenger service, but also allowing the city to develop and grow can be seen as a goal in itself.  As well as the buildings built by the computer, in response to the materials being present, the player can construct their own buildings, such as [[ski resort]]s and [[hotel]]s, and make profits from them if the conditions are right.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n'''''A.III.
