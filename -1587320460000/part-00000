The Gators played their home games at [[Ben Hill Griffin Stadium]] in [[Gainesville, Florida]], and competed in the Eastern Division of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC). They were led by second-year head coach [[Dan Mullen]].\n\nComing off a 10-win season that ended in a victory in the [[2018 Peach Bowl (December)|Peach Bowl]] in Mullen's first year, Florida began the 2019 season ranked eighth in the preseason [[AP Poll]]. They opened the schedule by rekindling their [[Florida\u2013Miami football rivalry|rivalry]] with [[2019 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami]] in a game played in [[Orlando]], winning 24\u201320. The Gators won their first six games, including a win over then-No. 7 [[2019 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]], before falling on the road to then-No. 5 [[2019 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]]. Three weeks later, they fell again to [[2019 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]] in Jacksonville. Florida ended the regular season in second in the East Division behind Georgia at 10\u20132 (6\u20132 SEC), and were invited to the [[2019 Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] to play ACC runner-up [[2019 Virginia Cavaliers football team|Virginia]]. The Gators won the bowl game, 36\u201328, to end the season with 11 wins, and were ranked sixth in the final AP Poll.\n\n[[Feleipe Franks]] began the year as the Gators' starting quarterback, but he suffered a season-ending ankle injury in the third game of the season against Kentucky. He was replaced by [[Kyle Trask]], who finished the year with 2,941 yards and 25 touchdowns, and had the conference's second best passer rating (156.1). Tight end [[Kyle Pitts]] was named first-team all-conference. Florida's defense ranked second in the SEC in points and yards allowed, and was led by first-team all-conference defensive end [[Jonathan Greenard]], who led the conference in sacks (10) and tackles for loss (16). Cornerback [[CJ Henderson (American football)|CJ Henderson]] was also named first-team all-conference by the coaches.\n\n==Preseason==\n\n===Position key===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|[[Running

On the opening drive, Florida converted a third down, but Georgia took over at their own 40-yard line after an incomplete pass by Kyle Trask on fourth and inches. On their sixteen-play drive, Georgia made four third down conversions and scored first with a field goal by [[Rodrigo Blankenship]]. The next Florida drive was a [[three-and-out]], with Trask being sacked once, but Georgia's next drive was stopped by the Florida defense and they were forced to punt. After another three-and-out by Florida, Georgia marched down the field with three third down conversions, ending their drive with a touchdown pass from [[Jake Fromm]] to Dominick Blaylock to bring the score to 10\u20130 with under five minutes left in the first half. Florida answered with an Evan McPherson field goal, but this was negated by another Blankenship field goal near the end of the half, bringing the score to 13\u20133 in favor of Georgia.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"GeorgiaNov2BoxScore\"/>\n\nTo open the second half, Georgia made a nine-play drive that included a one-handed catch by Brian Herrien of a pass from Fromm, capping it with Blankenship's third field goal of the game to extend their lead to 13 points. Both teams punted on their next drives, but Florida rallied with a nine-play drive that resulted in their first touchdown, made by Van Jefferson off a 23-yard pass by Trask. This narrowed the score differential to a touchdown with just under fourteen minutes left in the game, but on the next drive Georgia pulled away when Lawrence Cager completed a 52-yard pass from Jake Fromm for a touchdown. Together with a successful 2-point attempt, also from Fromm to Cager, this extended the Georgia lead to fourteen points. A 75-yard Florida drive ended with a Trask 2-yard touchdown pass to Freddie Swain with just over three minutes remaining in the game. Returning Florida's punt to their own 32-yard line, Georgia ran out the clock to seal their victory.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"GeorgiaNov2BoxScore\" /> \n\nAfter the game, Florida dropped from

The Gators played their home games at [[Ben Hill Griffin Stadium]] in [[Gainesville, Florida]], and competed in the Eastern Division of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC). They were led by second-year head coach [[Dan Mullen]].\n\nComing off a 10-win season that ended in a victory in the [[2018 Peach Bowl (December)|Peach Bowl]] in Mullen's first year, Florida began the 2019 season ranked eighth in the preseason [[AP Poll]]. They opened the schedule by rekindling their [[Florida\u2013Miami football rivalry|rivalry]] with [[2019 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami]] in a game played in [[Orlando]], winning 24\u201320. The Gators won their first six games, including a win over then-No. 7 [[2019 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]], before falling on the road to then-No. 5 [[2019 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]]. Three weeks later, they fell again to [[2019 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]] in Jacksonville. Florida ended the regular season in second in the East Division behind Georgia at 10\u20132 (6\u20132 SEC), and were invited to the [[2019 Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] to play ACC runner-up [[2019 Virginia Cavaliers football team|Virginia]]. The Gators won the bowl game, 36\u201328, to end the season with 11 wins, and were ranked sixth in the final AP Poll.\n\n[[Feleipe Franks]] began the year as the Gators' starting quarterback, but he suffered a season-ending ankle injury in the third game of the season against Kentucky. He was replaced by [[Kyle Trask]], who finished the year with 2,941 yards and 25 touchdowns, and had the conference's second best passer rating (156.1). Tight end [[Kyle Pitts]] was named first-team all-conference. Florida's defense ranked second in the SEC in points and yards allowed, and was led by first-team all-conference defensive end [[Jonathan Greenard]], who led the conference in sacks (10) and tackles for loss (16). Cornerback [[CJ Henderson (American football)|CJ Henderson]] was also named first-team all-conference by the coaches.\n\n==Preseason==\n\n===Position key===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|[[Running

football rivalry|rivalry game]], played at the neutral site [[TIAA Bank Field]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]].<ref>{{Cite

East|last=Harry|first=Chris|date=November 2, 2019|work=|access-date=November 4, 2019|publisher=Florida Gators}}</ref> \n\nGeorgia won the opening coin toss and elected to defer to the second half. On the opening drive, Florida converted a third down, but Georgia took over at their own 40-yard line after an incomplete pass by Kyle Trask on fourth and inches. On their sixteen-play drive, Georgia made four third down conversions and scored first with a field goal by [[Rodrigo Blankenship]]. The next Florida drive was a [[three-and-out]], with Trask being sacked once, but Georgia's next drive was stopped by the Florida defense and they were forced to punt. After another three-and-out by Florida, Georgia marched down the field with three third down conversions, ending their drive with a touchdown pass from [[Jake Fromm]] to Dominick Blaylock to bring the score to 10\u20130 with under five minutes left in the first half. Florida answered with an Evan McPherson field goal, but this was negated by another Blankenship field goal near the end of the half, bringing the score to 13\u20133 in favor of Georgia.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"GeorgiaNov2BoxScore\"/>\n\nTo open the second half, Georgia made a nine-play drive that included a one-handed catch by Brian Herrien of a pass from Fromm, capping it with Blankenship's third field goal of the game to extend their lead to 13 points. Both teams punted on their next drives, but Florida rallied with a nine-play drive that resulted in their first touchdown, made by Van Jefferson off a 23-yard pass by Trask. This narrowed the score differential to a touchdown with just under fourteen minutes left in the game, but on the next drive Georgia pulled away when Lawrence Cager completed a 52-yard pass from Jake Fromm for a touchdown. Together with a successful 2-point attempt, also from Fromm to Cager, this extended the Georgia lead to fourteen points. A 75-yard Florida drive ended with a Trask 2-yard touchdown pass to Freddie Swain with just over three minutes remaining in the game. Returning Florida's punt to their own 32-yard line, Georgia ran out the clock to seal their victory.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"GeorgiaNov2BoxScore\" /> \n\nAfter the game, Florida dropped from

[[American football|Football]] was popular at the Carlisle Industrial school and they became well known for their football and other athletic programs.<ref name=\":8\" />  Most historians agree that the primary purpose of athletic teams at Indian boarding schools was to promote physical health.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":8\" />  Diseases and poor health were constant points of concern for the Indian boarding schools, a fact that became well known after the 1928 [[Meriam Report]] exposed the high number of deaths among students.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":8\" />  Medical research at the time cited that physical activity in general and outdoor activity more specifically were the best practices to combat disease.<ref name=\":8\" />  Also common in American society at the time, sport was assumed to help build moral character by instilling hard-work, discipline, and sportsmanship, especially in boys.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":8\" />  Pratt also believed that athletic teams of Indians would show the white community that Native Americans were more than \"savages\" and capable of being good sportsmen with whites in their own games.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":8\" />\n[[File:Military Reservation of Fort Shaw.png|thumb|Map of Fort Shaw as a military outpost.]]\n== History of Fort Shaw Indian School ==\nAbandoned by the United States Army on 1 July 1891, [[Fort Shaw]] (located in north central [[Montana]]) was originally built between [[Fort Benton, Montana|Fort Benton]] and [[Helena, Montana|Helena]] to protect the settlers from Indian attacks.<ref name=\":1\" />  In 1892, nearly 5,000 acres of the fort and its surrounding land were re-purposed as the Fort Shaw Government Industrial Indian Boarding School by the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] after a government school in northeastern Montana burned down.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":5\" />  It opened it's doors on December 27th of that year with 52 students.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=McCormick|first=David|date=August 1, 2018|title=Their Winning Hoops Brought Admiring Whoops|journal=Wild West|volume=31|pages=28-29|via=EBSCO}}</ref>  By the turn of the century the school had over 300 students, ages five to eighteen, with thirty employees.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" />  Typically, academic classes were taught in the morning with more vocational courses, like cooking and sewing, in the afternoons.<ref name=\":9\" />  The [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot tribe]] saw the greatest representation at the Fort Shaw school.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe school lost government funding on April 17, 1910 as a result of a growing support for the abolishment of non-reservation schools in Congress and growing integration of public schools.

It is boosted into space by a [[launch vehicle]], then re-enters Earth's atmosphere and lands as a [[spaceplane]]. The X-37 is operated by the [[United States Space Force]] for orbital [[Spaceflight#Earth-launched spaceflight|spaceflight]] missions intended to demonstrate [[reusable launch system|reusable space technologies]].<ref name=USAF_factsh/> It is a 120%-scaled derivative of the earlier [[Boeing X-40]]. The X-37 began as a [[NASA]] project in 1999, before being transferred to the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] in 2004. Its first flight was during a drop test in 2006. X-37s have completed five orbital missions.\n\nThe spaceplane's first mission, [[USA-212]], was launched in April 2010 and returned to Earth in December 2010. A second X-37 was launched on mission [[USA-226]] in March 2011 and returned in June 2012. The third mission was [[USA-240]], which launched in December 2012 and landed in October 2014. The fourth mission, USA-261, launched in May 2015 and landed in May 2017. The fifth and latest X-37 mission, USA-277, was launched on 7 September 2017, and was the longest X-37 mission to date,<ref name=\"GZM-20190827\">{{cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/secret-u-s-air-force-spaceplane-breaks-record-with-719-1837605822 |title=Secretive U.S. Air Force Spaceplane Breaks Record With 719 Straight Days in Orbit|work=[[Gizmodo]]|last=Novak|first=Matt|date=27 August 2019|accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref> landing on 27 October 2019 after {{time interval|7 September 2017 14:00|27 October 2019 07:51|show=d|duration=on}} in orbit.<ref name=\"sfnow20191027\"/><ref name=\"today20191027\"/>\n\n==Development==\n===Origins===\nIn 1999, NASA selected [[Boeing Defense, Space & Security|Boeing Integrated Defense Systems]] to design and develop an orbital vehicle, built by the California branch of Boeing's [[Boeing Phantom Works|Phantom Works]].
