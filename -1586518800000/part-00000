In 1931, the AROCWE, headed by Metropolitan [[Eulogius (Georgievsky)]], passed to the Patriarchate of Constantinople and received the status of \"temporarily united special exarchate of the Most Holy Patriarchal Ecumenical See on the territory of Europe\". In 1965, it declared itself \"an independent and independent Archdiocese of the Orthodox Church of France and Western Europe\". From 1971 to 1999, it was affiliated to the [[Greek Orthodox Metropolis of France]]. From 1999 to 2018, it was the Exarchate of the Orthodox Russian churches in Western Europe under the Ecumenical Patriarchate.\n\nAlthough the issue of returning to the Moscow Patriarchate has been raised many times, the process of preparing for the transition of this Archdiocese to the Russian Orthodox Church only began after the Synod of the Patriarchate of Constantinople abolished the status of an Exarchate on November 27, 2018, with the requirement that its parishes join the metropolises of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. The Archdiocese itself, led by its primate, Archbishop [[John (Renneteau)]], refused to comply with this requirement and, wishing to continue to preserve its own existence and its own traditions, began to look for ways out of the situation. Various options were proposed for this purpose, but the proposal to join the Moscow Patriarchate received the greatest support.

The first meeting between the commissions took place on January 28 in Paris.<ref name=9_468_lose/> Bishop Sabbas (Tutunov) defined the principles that guided the negotiating Committee of the Moscow Patriarchate: \"in relation to the Archdiocese of Constantinople, it was a double game. On the one hand, it [Constantinople] seemed to recognize its [AROCWE] specificities, and on the other \u2014 and this has been well shown by the practice of recent years \u2014 Constantinople believed that the Statute of the Archdiocese was conditional, and the Fanar could determine the order of election of the Archbishop himself. The Russian Orthodox Church is ready to preserve the administrative tradition of the Archdiocese along with its other features. In particular, we have set out as clearly as possible the procedure for the election of bishops, which would reflect the practice of determining candidates and the election itself within the Archdiocese, and at the same time give the Moscow Patriarchate's clergy a ''droit de regard'' - the right to look at the list of candidates. This is in line with the practice proposed by the Council of 1917-1918, and it is this Council that is often referred to in the Archdiocese.\"<ref>''\u0424\u0430\u0443\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u041c.''

With the largest number of monks and a truly pastoral attitude of the hierarchy and clergy to their people. There are hundreds of Romanian parishes in Western Europe, most of which use local languages for worship, not just Romanian. Many Romanian bishops and priests studied at the [[St. Sergius Orthodox Theological Institute|Paris Theological Institute]] since the French language is not very difficult for Romanians. But this is still too strange an option. Perhaps it is acceptable for French or English-speaking communities (what difference to them that the ecclesiastical authorities be Russian, Greek, or Romanian?), but not for the Russian [[Church (congregation)|congregation]], which for all these decades has considered itself a part of [[Russian Orthodoxy]].\"<ref name=carnegie_78030/>\n\nBut by August 2019, all these options had disappeared one by one. The Romanian Orthodox Church offered only a temporary [[omophorion]], and only with the permission of Patriarch Bartholomew. The ROCOR stated that they could not \"preserve the historical form of the Archdiocese\", and therefore suggested that the European parishes join the ROCOR dioceses in Western Europe with a mandatory change in the \"calendar and liturgical language\", which was significant, since a significant part of the Archdiocese's parishes served on the [[New Julian calendar]]. The OCA refused, citing \"its own circumstances\".<ref name=9_470_archi/> According to the Secretary of the Council of the Archdiocese, Nikolai Lopukhin, all other local Orthodox churches except the Russian, with whom conversations were conducted, did not want to quarrel with Constantinople.<ref name=9_475_moscow/>\n\nOn 9 August, Archbishop John wrote that the AROCWE had petitioned the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia|ROCOR]], the [[Orthodox Church in America|OCA]], the [[Romanian Orthodox Church|RomOC]], and the [[Moscow Patriarchate]] to be received into their jurisdictions, and that a delegation of the AROCWE also met with the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarchate]]. Only the Moscow Patriarchate was able to propose a satisfying status to the AROCWE, i.e. if the AROCWE was to join the ROC, the former would maintain its structures and autonomy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.exarchat.eu/spip.php?article2392|title=Archev\u00each\u00e9 des \u00e9glises russes en Europe occidentale - Annonce : documents relatifs aux diff\u00e9rentes d\u00e9marches entreprises \u00e0 la suite de l'AGE du 23 f\u00e9vrier dernier|website=www.exarchat.eu|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref>{{Efn|See also [http://www.ng.ru/faith/2019-08-10/100_190810_church.html this article] (in Russian) with comments of Archbishop John and deacon Alexander of the AROCWE.|name=ng.ru|group=}}\n\nHowever, a number of parishes passed to the [[orthodoxwiki:Romanian_Orthodox_Metropolitanate_of_Western_and_Southern_Europe|Metropolitan diocese of Western and Southern Europe of the Romanian Orthodox Church]].

He officially announced this idea on May 11, 2019, at a pastoral meeting. As he explained in an interview with an Independent newspaper: \"Then we declared our independence from everyone. A special Declaration was drawn up, signed by priests Nikolai Afanasiev and Alexey Knyazev, as well as Konstantin Andronikov and other leading professors of our theological Institute of St. Sergius in Paris. There were no disputes about our independence at that time, but we were looking for some other way. And in 1971, we again received recognition from Constantinople. First temporary, and in 1999 permanent. But while it was not there, we were independent and everyone recognized us, we were in communication with all the churches, no one ignored us and called us heretics. So now we just offer exactly the same solution to the issue as in 1965.\" In the words of archdeacon Vsevolod Borzakovsky, another cleric of the Archdiocese: \"some members of the Archdiocese believe that its future generations will no longer be associated with either Greece or Russia. They live and will live in the West, so now is the time to think about creating their own European Orthodox Church.\"<ref name=9_464_eu/>\n\nIn August 2019, Archdiocese cleric Archpriest George Ashkov published an open letter offering his program for overcoming the crisis that had befallen the Archdiocese.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://credo.press/226090/|title=\u041c\u042b\u0421\u041b\u0418: \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0439 \u0410\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0432. \u0417\u0412\u0423\u0427\u0418\u0422 \u041d\u0410\u0411\u0410\u0422 \u2013 \u0421\u041e\u0417\u042b\u0412\u0410\u0415\u0422\u0421\u042f \u041f\u0410\u0420\u0418\u0416\u0421\u041a\u0418\u0419 \u0421\u041e\u0411\u041e\u0420. \u041e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043c\u043e \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0436\u0435 \u043e \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0435 \u043f\u0443\u0442\u0438 \u043a \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043a\u0435\u0444\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0438 \u2014 Credo.Press|website=credo.press|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ahilla.ru/sobornost-nashe-glavnoe-oruzhie/|title=\u0421\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u2014 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0435!|language=ru-RU|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref> He called for not accepting anyone's omophorion, and for creating an independent Church structure with a project to create an independent local Church, which he recommended to call \"the Orthodox Church of the Russian tradition in Western Europe according to the statutes of the Moscow Council of 1917-18\".<ref name=11_471_konstantinopol/> He advocated the election of bishops from among the clergy of the Archdiocese and changing its Charter so that it became the Charter of the local Church. The Archdiocese's cleric, deacon Alexander Zanemonets, commented on the project: \"This option could be interesting not in the context of the current issues facing the Archdiocese, but in the context of the internal structure of the diocese. Something we've been missing for a long time. But all this can be considered only after we get into a canonical jurisdiction.\"<ref name=11_471_konstantinopol/> According to Jivko Panev, the structure proposed by George Ashkov will look more like a sect. \"Our dilemma is not to choose between Constantinople and Moscow, our current choice is either to be in the Church or to be outside It. In my opinion, father George's proposal is utopian. It is illiterate from the point of view of both canons and ecclesiology. We cannot compare our situation with what happened in the Orthodox Church in America on the eve of the recognition of its autocephaly. There were nine bishops and 360 parishes. We don't have that. Moreover, there was support for the Moscow Patriarchate. No one will support us. Patriarch Bartholomew has already stated that he will declare such a Church structure non-canonical.\"<ref name=11_471_konstantinopol/>\n\nIn early September, after the decision of the Patriarchate of Constantinople to release Archbishop John from the management of the parishes of the former exarachate, Archpriest George Ashkov unexpectedly asked to withdraw his project \"because it remains impossible to consider it in the new situation\".

The Archdiocese is headed by an archbishop who does not need to be replaced, and the Council of the Archdiocese as such has never validly requested such an appointment. Such a request is expressly provided for in our statutes (art. 52). Monsignor Emmanuel cannot finally and in any case represent the archdiocese which was welcomed on October 8 by the Holy Synod of the Moscow Patriarchate within the Moscow Patriarchate. Monsignor Emmanuel depends on the Patriarchate of Constantinople.\n\nFinally, it will be recalled that the locum tenens is in charge of acting in Current Affairs, and may not make any appointment, transfer or dismissal of priests. This is also reflected in our statutes (art. 53). He cannot therefore take any initiative whatsoever concerning the \"preservation of his interests and the regularization of his currently very unstable situation\". It will be recalled that on October 5 last, Monsignor Emmanuel gathered, as it is written on the website of the Greek Metropolis of France, \"clerics and laity of the former Exarchate of parishes of Russian tradition in Western Europe in France\", and \"these clerics, following the last events, accepted the decisions of the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, and, following the Holy Canons, worked on the form of their meeting within the metropolis of France\". These clerics, whose authors of the \"communiqu\u00e9\", are no longer in our Archdiocese, but in the Greek Metropolis. [...]\n\nThe diocesan administration remains in place, under the authority of its Archbishop John, and will continue to ensure that the choice of the archdiocese in its vast majority, is respected. It will defend the Archdiocese and its members, if necessary, against any form of usurpation.|author=|title=|source=}}On 11 October, seven members of the Council of the Archdiocese published a communique in which they expressed their protest against what they said was an act of \"gross violation of the Statute\" on the part of Archbishop John Renneteau that had occurred in the St Sergius Church in Paris on 8 October where he intruded and celebrated liturgy without the invitation and against the will of the Rector.<ref name=\"Communiqu\u00e911oct2\">{{Cite web|url=https://mgro.fr/2019/10/11/communique-du-conseil-de-larcheveche/|title=Communiqu\u00e9 du Conseil de l'Archev\u00each\u00e9|last=|first=|date=2019-10-11|website=Metropole Grecque Orthodoxe de France \u2013 \u0399\u03b5\u03c1\u03ac \u039c\u03b7\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 \u0393\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03c2|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=2019-10-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://credo.press/226984/|title=\u0414\u041e\u041a\u0423\u041c\u0415\u041d\u0422: \"\u041e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043c \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0430 \u0418\u043e\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u0414\u0443\u0431\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043c\u044b\u0448\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\". \u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u044e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0435 \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0436\u0435 [\u0432\u043d\u0435 \u0420\u041f\u0426 \u041c\u041f], 10 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2019 \u0433.|last=|first=|date=|website=Credo.Press|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Official act of reunion ===\nIn early October, Archbishop John Renneteau told [[TASS]] he would travel to Moscow and sign a document on the incorporation of those who would follow him into the ROC on 3 November 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tass.ru/obschestvo/6971920|title=\u0410\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0446\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0435\u0439 \u0432 \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043f\u0438\u0448\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u043e \u0432\u043e\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0441 \u0420\u041f\u0426 3 \u043d\u043e\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f|last=|first=|date=7 October 2019|website=\u0422\u0410\u0421\u0421|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> However, on 1 November 2019 at the Throne room of the Patriarchal and residence at the [[Danilov Monastery|Danilov monastery in Moscow]] [[Patriarch Kirill of Moscow|Patriarch Kirill]] single-handedly signed the Patriarchal and Synodal Charter (\"Grammota\") that claimed to restore the unity of the Archdiocese with the ROC.

In 1931, the AROCWE, headed by Metropolitan [[Eulogius (Georgievsky)]], passed to the Patriarchate of Constantinople and received the status of \"temporarily united special exarchate of the Most Holy Patriarchal Ecumenical See on the territory of Europe\". In 1965, it declared itself \"an independent and independent Archdiocese of the Orthodox Church of France and Western Europe\". From 1971 to 1999, it was affiliated to the [[Greek Orthodox Metropolis of France]]. From 1999 to 2018, it was the Exarchate of the Orthodox Russian churches in Western Europe under the Ecumenical Patriarchate.\n\nAlthough the issue of returning to the Moscow Patriarchate has been raised many times, the process of preparing for the transition of this Archdiocese to the Russian Orthodox Church only began after the Synod of the Patriarchate of Constantinople abolished the status of an Exarchate on November 27, 2018, with the requirement that its parishes join the metropolises of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. The Archdiocese itself, led by its primate, Archbishop [[John (Renneteau)]], refused to comply with this requirement and, wishing to continue to preserve its own existence and its own traditions, began to look for ways out of the situation. Various options were proposed for this purpose, but the proposal to join the Moscow Patriarchate received the greatest support. On September 14, 2019, the [[Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church]] received Archbishop John (Renneteau) into the clergy of the Moscow Patriarchate, entrusting him with the management of the clergy and parishes that wanted to follow him.<ref>{{cite web |title=Holy Synod session minutes of September 14, 2019 |url=http://www.patriarchia.ru/en/db/text/5499627.html |website=patriarchia.ru |language=en |date=14 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Russian Orthodox Church Holy Synod integrates the head of the Archdiocese of the Western European Parishes of Russian Tradition as well as clergy and parishes who wish to follow him |url=http://www.patriarchia.ru/en/db/text/5500331.html |website=[[patriarchia.ru]] |language=en |date=14 September 2019}}</ref> On October 7 of the same year, based on the resolution of the Pastoral assembly of the Archdiocese, the Holy Synod of ROC adopted the Archdiocese itself.<ref name=\"zhurnal7okt\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.patriarchia.ru/db/text/5508653.html|title=\u0416\u0423\u0420\u041d\u0410\u041b\u042b \u0437\u0430\u0441\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0421\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0442 7 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2019 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u0416\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b \u2116 123|publisher=[[Patriarchia.ru]]|date=2019-10-07 |accessdate=2019-10-07|url-status=live}}</ref> The decision, among other things, determined that the Archdiocese would operate within the Moscow Patriarchate  with special rights, in particular, \"its liturgical and pastoral features, which are part of its traditions\", as well as \"the historically established features of its diocesan and parish administration, including those established by Metropolitan Eulogius (Georgievsky), based on the peculiarities of the existence of the ecclesiastical inheritance headed by him in Western Europe and taking into account certain decisions of the all-Russian Church Council of 1917-1918\" are preserved.<ref name=\"zhurnal7okt\" />\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Archdiocese of Western European parishes joined the Russian Orthodox Church on November 2-4, 2019.

With the largest number of monks and a truly pastoral attitude of the hierarchy and clergy to their people. There are hundreds of Romanian parishes in Western Europe, most of which use local languages for worship, not just Romanian. Many Romanian bishops and priests studied at the [[St. Sergius Orthodox Theological Institute|Paris Theological Institute]] since the French language is not very difficult for Romanians. But this is still too strange an option. Perhaps it is acceptable for French or English-speaking communities (what difference to them that the ecclesiastical authorities be Russian, Greek, or Romanian?), but not for the Russian [[Church (congregation)|congregation]], which for all these decades has considered itself a part of [[Russian Orthodoxy]].\"<ref name=carnegie_78030/>\n\nBut by August 2019, all these options had disappeared one by one. The Romanian Orthodox Church offered only a temporary [[omophorion]], and only with the permission of Patriarch Bartholomew. The ROCOR stated that they could not \"preserve the historical form of the Archdiocese\", and therefore suggested that the European parishes join the ROCOR dioceses in Western Europe with a mandatory change in the \"calendar and liturgical language\", which was significant, since a significant part of the Archdiocese's parishes served on the [[New Julian calendar]]. The OCA refused, citing \"its own circumstances\".<ref name=9_470_archi/> According to the Secretary of the Council of the Archdiocese, Nikolai Lopukhin, all other local Orthodox churches except the Russian, with whom conversations were conducted, did not want to quarrel with Constantinople.<ref name=9_475_moscow/>\n\nOn 9 August, Archbishop John wrote that the AROCWE had petitioned the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia|ROCOR]], the [[Orthodox Church in America|OCA]], the [[Romanian Orthodox Church|RomOC]], and the [[Moscow Patriarchate]] to be received into their jurisdictions, and that a delegation of the AROCWE also met with the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarchate]]. Only the Moscow Patriarchate was able to propose a satisfying status to the AROCWE, i.e. if the AROCWE was to join the ROC, the former would maintain its structures and autonomy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.exarchat.eu/spip.php?article2392|title=Archev\u00each\u00e9 des \u00e9glises russes en Europe occidentale - Annonce : documents relatifs aux diff\u00e9rentes d\u00e9marches entreprises \u00e0 la suite de l'AGE du 23 f\u00e9vrier dernier|website=www.exarchat.eu|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref>{{Efn|See also [http://www.ng.ru/faith/2019-08-10/100_190810_church.html this article] (in Russian) with comments of Archbishop John and deacon Alexander of the AROCWE.|name=ng.ru|group=}}\n\nHowever, a number of parishes passed to the [[orthodoxwiki:Romanian_Orthodox_Metropolitanate_of_Western_and_Southern_Europe|Metropolitan diocese of Western and Southern Europe of the Romanian Orthodox Church]].

He officially announced this idea on May 11, 2019, at a pastoral meeting. As he explained in an interview with an Independent newspaper: \"Then we declared our independence from everyone. A special Declaration was drawn up, signed by priests Nikolai Afanasiev and Alexey Knyazev, as well as Konstantin Andronikov and other leading professors of our theological Institute of St. Sergius in Paris. There were no disputes about our independence at that time, but we were looking for some other way. And in 1971, we again received recognition from Constantinople. First temporary, and in 1999 permanent. But while it was not there, we were independent and everyone recognized us, we were in communication with all the churches, no one ignored us and called us heretics. So now we just offer exactly the same solution to the issue as in 1965.\" In the words of archdeacon Vsevolod Borzakovsky, another cleric of the Archdiocese: \"some members of the Archdiocese believe that its future generations will no longer be associated with either Greece or Russia. They live and will live in the West, so now is the time to think about creating their own European Orthodox Church.\"<ref name=9_464_eu/>\n\nIn August 2019, Archdiocese cleric Archpriest George Ashkov published an open letter offering his program for overcoming the crisis that had befallen the Archdiocese.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://credo.press/226090/|title=\u041c\u042b\u0421\u041b\u0418: \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0439 \u0410\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0432. \u0417\u0412\u0423\u0427\u0418\u0422 \u041d\u0410\u0411\u0410\u0422 \u2013 \u0421\u041e\u0417\u042b\u0412\u0410\u0415\u0422\u0421\u042f \u041f\u0410\u0420\u0418\u0416\u0421\u041a\u0418\u0419 \u0421\u041e\u0411\u041e\u0420. \u041e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043c\u043e \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0436\u0435 \u043e \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0435 \u043f\u0443\u0442\u0438 \u043a \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043a\u0435\u0444\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0438 \u2014 Credo.Press|website=credo.press|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ahilla.ru/sobornost-nashe-glavnoe-oruzhie/|title=\u0421\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u2014 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0435!|language=ru-RU|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref> He called for not accepting anyone's omophorion, and for creating an independent Church structure with a project to create an independent local Church, which he recommended to call \"the Orthodox Church of the Russian tradition in Western Europe according to the statutes of the Moscow Council of 1917-18\".<ref name=11_471_konstantinopol/> He advocated the election of bishops from among the clergy of the Archdiocese and changing its Charter so that it became the Charter of the local Church. The Archdiocese's cleric, deacon Alexander Zanemonets, commented on the project: \"This option could be interesting not in the context of the current issues facing the Archdiocese, but in the context of the internal structure of the diocese. Something we've been missing for a long time. But all this can be considered only after we get into a canonical jurisdiction.\"<ref name=11_471_konstantinopol/> According to Jivko Panev, the structure proposed by George Ashkov will look more like a sect. \"Our dilemma is not to choose between Constantinople and Moscow, our current choice is either to be in the Church or to be outside It. In my opinion, father George's proposal is utopian. It is illiterate from the point of view of both canons and ecclesiology. We cannot compare our situation with what happened in the Orthodox Church in America on the eve of the recognition of its autocephaly. There were nine bishops and 360 parishes. We don't have that. Moreover, there was support for the Moscow Patriarchate. No one will support us. Patriarch Bartholomew has already stated that he will declare such a Church structure non-canonical.\"<ref name=11_471_konstantinopol/>\n\nIn early September, after the decision of the Patriarchate of Constantinople to release Archbishop John from the management of the parishes of the former exarachate, Archpriest George Ashkov unexpectedly asked to withdraw his project \"because it remains impossible to consider it in the new situation\".

The Archdiocese is headed by an archbishop who does not need to be replaced, and the Council of the Archdiocese as such has never validly requested such an appointment. Such a request is expressly provided for in our statutes (art. 52). Monsignor Emmanuel cannot finally and in any case represent the archdiocese which was welcomed on October 8 by the Holy Synod of the Moscow Patriarchate within the Moscow Patriarchate. Monsignor Emmanuel depends on the Patriarchate of Constantinople.\n\nFinally, it will be recalled that the locum tenens is in charge of acting in Current Affairs, and may not make any appointment, transfer or dismissal of priests. This is also reflected in our statutes (art. 53). He cannot therefore take any initiative whatsoever concerning the \"preservation of his interests and the regularization of his currently very unstable situation\". It will be recalled that on October 5 last, Monsignor Emmanuel gathered, as it is written on the website of the Greek Metropolis of France, \"clerics and laity of the former Exarchate of parishes of Russian tradition in Western Europe in France\", and \"these clerics, following the last events, accepted the decisions of the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, and, following the Holy Canons, worked on the form of their meeting within the metropolis of France\". These clerics, whose authors of the \"communiqu\u00e9\", are no longer in our Archdiocese, but in the Greek Metropolis. [...]\n\nThe diocesan administration remains in place, under the authority of its Archbishop John, and will continue to ensure that the choice of the archdiocese in its vast majority, is respected. It will defend the Archdiocese and its members, if necessary, against any form of usurpation.|author=|title=|source=}}On 11 October, seven members of the Council of the Archdiocese published a communique in which they expressed their protest against what they said was an act of \"gross violation of the Statute\" on the part of Archbishop John Renneteau that had occurred in the St Sergius Church in Paris on 8 October where he intruded and celebrated liturgy without the invitation and against the will of the Rector.<ref name=\"Communiqu\u00e911oct2\">{{Cite web|url=https://mgro.fr/2019/10/11/communique-du-conseil-de-larcheveche/|title=Communiqu\u00e9 du Conseil de l'Archev\u00each\u00e9|last=|first=|date=2019-10-11|website=Metropole Grecque Orthodoxe de France \u2013 \u0399\u03b5\u03c1\u03ac \u039c\u03b7\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 \u0393\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03c2|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=2019-10-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://credo.press/226984/|title=\u0414\u041e\u041a\u0423\u041c\u0415\u041d\u0422: \"\u041e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043c \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0430 \u0418\u043e\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u0414\u0443\u0431\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043c\u044b\u0448\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\". \u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u044e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0435 \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0436\u0435 [\u0432\u043d\u0435 \u0420\u041f\u0426 \u041c\u041f], 10 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2019 \u0433.|last=|first=|date=|website=Credo.Press|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Official act of reunion ===\nIn early October, Archbishop John Renneteau told [[TASS]] he would travel to Moscow and sign a document on the incorporation of those who would follow him into the ROC on 3 November 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tass.ru/obschestvo/6971920|title=\u0410\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0446\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0435\u0439 \u0432 \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043f\u0438\u0448\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u043e \u0432\u043e\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0441 \u0420\u041f\u0426 3 \u043d\u043e\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f|last=|first=|date=7 October 2019|website=\u0422\u0410\u0421\u0421|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> However, on 1 November 2019 at the Throne room of the Patriarchal and residence at the [[Danilov Monastery|Danilov monastery in Moscow]] [[Patriarch Kirill of Moscow|Patriarch Kirill]] single-handedly signed the Patriarchal and Synodal Charter (\"Grammota\") that claimed to restore the unity of the Archdiocese with the ROC.

As long as this scheme remained dominant, the protozoa were understood to be animals and studied in departments of Zoology, while photosynthetic microorganisms and microscopic fungi\u2014the so-called Protophyta\u2014were assigned to the Plants, and studied in departments of Botany.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal |last=Taylor |first=F.

For example, the algae ''[[Euglena]]'' and ''[[Dinobryon]]'' have [[chloroplast]]s for [[photosynthesis]], but can also feed on organic matter and are [[Motility|motile]]. In 1860, [[John Hogg (biologist)|John Hogg]] argued against the use of \"protozoa\", on the grounds that \"naturalists are divided in opinion\u2014and probably some will ever continue so\u2014whether many of these organisms, or living beings, are animals or plants.\"<ref name=\"Hogg\" /> As an alternative, he proposed a new kingdom called Primigenum, consisting of both the protozoa and unicellular algae (protophyta), which he combined together under the name \"Protoctista\". In Hoggs's conception, the animal and plant kingdoms were likened to two great \"pyramids\" blending at their bases in the Kingdom Primigenum.\n\nSix years later, [[Ernst Haeckel]] also proposed a third kingdom of life, which he named [[Protista]]. At first, Haeckel included a few multicellular organisms in this kingdom, but in later work he restricted the Protista to single-celled organisms, or simple colonies whose individual cells are not differentiated into different kinds of [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]].\n\nDespite these proposals, Protozoa emerged as the preferred taxonomic placement for [[Heterotrophic nutrition|heterotrophic]] microorganisms such as amoebae and ciliates, and remained so for more than a century. In the course of the 20th century, however, the old \"two kingdom\" system began to weaken, with the growing awareness that fungi did not belong among the plants, and that most of the unicellular protozoa were no more closely related to the animals than they were to the plants. By mid-century, some biologists, such as [[Herbert Copeland]], [[Robert H.

Some protozoans take in food by [[phagocytosis]], engulfing organic particles with [[pseudopodia]] (as [[amoeba]]e do), or taking in food through a specialized mouth-like aperture called a [[cytostome]]. Others take in food by [[osmotrophy]], absorbing dissolved nutrients through their [[cell membrane]]s.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nParasitic protozoans use a wide variety of feeding strategies, and some may change methods of feeding in different phases of their life cycle. For instance, the malaria parasite ''[[Plasmodium]]'' feeds by [[pinocytosis]] during its immature [[Apicomplexan life cycle|trophozoite]] stage of life (ring phase), but develops a dedicated feeding [[organelle]] (cytostome) as it matures within a host's red blood cell.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tulane.edu/~wiser/malaria/fv.html |title=Biochemistry of Plasmodium |last=Wiser |first=Mark F. |website=The Wiser Page |access-date=2018-03-22}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ameba_001.jpg|thumb|''[[Paramecium bursaria]]'', a ciliate which derives some of its nutrients from algal [[endosymbiont]]s in the genus ''[[Chlorella]]'']]\n\nProtozoa may also live as [[mixotroph]]s, supplementing a heterotrophic diet with some form of [[autotroph]]y. Some protozoa form close associations with symbiotic photosynthetic algae, which live and grow within the membranes of the larger cell and provide nutrients to the host. Others practice [[kleptoplasty]], stealing [[chloroplast]]s from prey organisms and maintaining them within their own cell bodies as they continue to produce nutrients through photosynthesis. The ciliate ''[[Mesodinium rubrum]]'' retains functioning [[plastid]]s from the cryptophyte algae on which it feeds, using them to nourish themselves by autotrophy. These, in turn, may be passed along to dinoflagellates of the genus [[Dinophysis]] , which prey on ''Mesodinium rubrum'' but keep the enslaved plastids for themselves. Within Dinophysis, these plastids can continue to function for months.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Nishitani |first=Goh |last2=Nagai |first2=Satoshi |last3=Baba|first3=Katsuhisa |last4=Kiyokawa |first4=Susumu |last5=Kosaka|first5=Yuki |last6=Miyamura |first6=Kazuyoshi |last7=Nishikawa |first7=Tetsuya |last8=Sakurada |first8=Kiyonari |last9=Shinada |first9=Akiyoshi |date=May 2010 |title=High-Level Congruence of Myrionecta rubra Prey and Dinophysis Species Plastid Identities as Revealed by Genetic Analyses of Isolates from Japanese Coastal Waters |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=76|issue=9 |pages=2791\u20132798 |doi=10.1128/AEM.02566-09 |pmc=2863437 |pmid=20305031}}</ref>\n\n=== Motility ===\n\nOrganisms traditionally classified as protozoa are abundant in [[aqueous]] environments and [[soil]], occupying a range of [[trophic level]]s. The group includes [[flagellate]]s (which move with the help of whip-like structures called [[flagella]]), [[ciliate]]s (which move by using hair-like structures called [[cilia]]) and [[amoeba]]e (which move by the use of foot-like structures called [[pseudopodia]]). Some protozoa are [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]], and do not move at all.\n\n=== Pellicle ===\nUnlike plants, fungi and most types of algae, protozoans do not typically have a rigid [[cell wall]], but are usually enveloped by elastic structures of membranes that permit movement of the cell. In some protozoans, such as the ciliates and [[euglenozoa]]ns, the cell is supported by a composite membranous envelope called the \"pellicle\". The pellicle gives some shape to the cell, especially during locomotion. Pellicles of protozoan organisms vary from flexible and elastic to fairly rigid.  In [[ciliate]]s and [[Apicomplexa]], the pellicle is supported by closely packed vesicles called alveoli. In [[euglenid]]s, it is formed from [[protein]] strips arranged spirally along the length of the body. Familiar examples of protists with a pellicle are the [[euglenoids]] and the ciliate ''[[Paramecium]]''. In some protozoa, the pellicle hosts [[Epibiont|epibiotic]] bacteria that adhere to the surface by their [[Pilus#fimbriae|fimbriae]] (attachment pili).<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/protozoainbiolog00calk#page/1008/mode/2up Protozoa in biological research<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[File:Dileptus_viridis_cyst.jpg|thumb|Resting cyst of ciliated protozoan ''Dileptus viridis''.]]\n\n=== Life cycle ===\n[[File:Toxoplasmosis life cycle en.svg|thumb|Life cycle of parasitic protozoan, ''Toxoplasma gondii'']]\nSome protozoa have two-phase life cycles, alternating between proliferative stages (e.g., [[trophozoite]]s) and dormant [[Microbial cyst|cysts]]. As cysts, protozoa can survive harsh conditions, such as exposure to extreme temperatures or harmful chemicals, or long periods without access to nutrients, water, or oxygen for periods of time. Being a cyst enables parasitic species to survive outside of a host, and allows their transmission from one host to another. When protozoa are in the form of [[trophozoite]]s (Greek ''tropho'' = to nourish), they actively feed. The conversion of a trophozoite to cyst form is known as encystation, while the process of transforming back into a trophozoite is known as excystation.\n\nAll protozoans reproduce (not all) asexually by [[binary fission]] or multiple fission. Many protozoan species exchange genetic material by sexual means (typically, through [[Isogamy#Conjugation|conjugation]]); however, sexuality is generally decoupled from the process of reproduction, and does not immediately result in increased population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/ca/academic/subjects/life-sciences/evolutionary-biology/sex-and-death-protozoa-history-obsession|title=Sex and Death in Protozoa|website=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=2015-06-09}}</ref>\n\nAlthough [[Origin and function of meiosis|meiotic sex]] is widespread among present day [[eukaryote]]s, it has, until recently, been unclear whether or not eukaryotes were sexual early in their evolution.  Due to recent advances in [[gene]] detection and other techniques, evidence has been found for some form of meiotic sex in an increasing number of protozoans of ancient lineage that diverged early in eukaryotic evolution.<ref>Bernstein H, Bernstein C (2013). Bernstein C, Bernstein H eds. ''Evolutionary Origin and Adaptive Function of Meiosis'. Meiosis. InTech. {{ISBN|978-953-51-1197-9}}''</ref>  (See [[Eukaryote#Reproduction|eukaryote reproduction]].)  Thus, such findings suggest that meiotic sex arose early in eukaryotic evolution. Examples of protozoan meiotic sexuality are described in the articles ''[[Amoebozoa]]'', ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'', ''[[Leishmania]]'', ''[[Plasmodium falciparum biology]]'', ''[[Paramecium]]'', ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', ''[[Trichomonas vaginalis]]'' and ''[[Trypanosoma brucei]]''.\n\n== Classification ==\n{{Further|wikispecies:Protozoa}}Historically, the Protozoa were classified as \"unicellular animals\", as distinct from the Protophyta, single-celled photosynthetic organisms (algae) which were considered primitive plants.

As long as this scheme remained dominant, the protozoa were understood to be animals and studied in departments of Zoology, while photosynthetic microorganisms and microscopic fungi\u2014the so-called Protophyta\u2014were assigned to the Plants, and studied in departments of Botany.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal |last=Taylor |first=F.

For example, the algae ''[[Euglena]]'' and ''[[Dinobryon]]'' have [[chloroplast]]s for [[photosynthesis]], but can also feed on organic matter and are [[Motility|motile]]. In 1860, [[John Hogg (biologist)|John Hogg]] argued against the use of \"protozoa\", on the grounds that \"naturalists are divided in opinion\u2014and probably some will ever continue so\u2014whether many of these organisms, or living beings, are animals or plants.\"<ref name=\"Hogg\" /> As an alternative, he proposed a new kingdom called Primigenum, consisting of both the protozoa and unicellular algae (protophyta), which he combined together under the name \"Protoctista\". In Hoggs's conception, the animal and plant kingdoms were likened to two great \"pyramids\" blending at their bases in the Kingdom Primigenum.\n\nSix years later, [[Ernst Haeckel]] also proposed a third kingdom of life, which he named [[Protista]]. At first, Haeckel included a few multicellular organisms in this kingdom, but in later work he restricted the Protista to single-celled organisms, or simple colonies whose individual cells are not differentiated into different kinds of [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]].\n\nDespite these proposals, Protozoa emerged as the preferred taxonomic placement for [[Heterotrophic nutrition|heterotrophic]] microorganisms such as amoebae and ciliates, and remained so for more than a century. In the course of the 20th century, however, the old \"two kingdom\" system began to weaken, with the growing awareness that fungi did not belong among the plants, and that most of the unicellular protozoa were no more closely related to the animals than they were to the plants. By mid-century, some biologists, such as [[Herbert Copeland]], [[Robert H. Whittaker]] and [[Lynn Margulis]], advocated the revival of Haeckel's Protista or Hogg's Protoctista as a kingdom-level eukaryotic group, alongside Plants, Animals and Fungi.<ref name=\":0\" /> A variety of [[Kingdom (biology)|multi-kingdom systems]] were proposed, and Kingdoms Protista and Protoctista became well established in biology texts and curricula.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Whittaker |first=R.

Some protozoans take in food by [[phagocytosis]], engulfing organic particles with [[pseudopodia]] (as [[amoeba]]e do), or taking in food through a specialized mouth-like aperture called a [[cytostome]]. Others take in food by [[osmotrophy]], absorbing dissolved nutrients through their [[cell membrane]]s.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nParasitic protozoans use a wide variety of feeding strategies, and some may change methods of feeding in different phases of their life cycle. For instance, the malaria parasite ''[[Plasmodium]]'' feeds by [[pinocytosis]] during its immature [[Apicomplexan life cycle|trophozoite]] stage of life (ring phase), but develops a dedicated feeding [[organelle]] (cytostome) as it matures within a host's red blood cell.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tulane.edu/~wiser/malaria/fv.html |title=Biochemistry of Plasmodium |last=Wiser |first=Mark F. |website=The Wiser Page |access-date=2018-03-22}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ameba_001.jpg|thumb|''[[Paramecium bursaria]]'', a ciliate which derives some of its nutrients from algal [[endosymbiont]]s in the genus ''[[Chlorella]]'']]\n\nProtozoa may also live as [[mixotroph]]s, supplementing a heterotrophic diet with some form of [[autotroph]]y. Some protozoa form close associations with symbiotic photosynthetic algae, which live and grow within the membranes of the larger cell and provide nutrients to the host. Others practice [[kleptoplasty]], stealing [[chloroplast]]s from prey organisms and maintaining them within their own cell bodies as they continue to produce nutrients through photosynthesis. The ciliate ''[[Mesodinium rubrum]]'' retains functioning [[plastid]]s from the cryptophyte algae on which it feeds, using them to nourish themselves by autotrophy. These, in turn, may be passed along to dinoflagellates of the genus [[Dinophysis]] , which prey on ''Mesodinium rubrum'' but keep the enslaved plastids for themselves. Within Dinophysis, these plastids can continue to function for months.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Nishitani |first=Goh |last2=Nagai |first2=Satoshi |last3=Baba|first3=Katsuhisa |last4=Kiyokawa |first4=Susumu |last5=Kosaka|first5=Yuki |last6=Miyamura |first6=Kazuyoshi |last7=Nishikawa |first7=Tetsuya |last8=Sakurada |first8=Kiyonari |last9=Shinada |first9=Akiyoshi |date=May 2010 |title=High-Level Congruence of Myrionecta rubra Prey and Dinophysis Species Plastid Identities as Revealed by Genetic Analyses of Isolates from Japanese Coastal Waters |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=76|issue=9 |pages=2791\u20132798 |doi=10.1128/AEM.02566-09 |pmc=2863437 |pmid=20305031}}</ref>\n\n=== Motility ===\n\nOrganisms traditionally classified as protozoa are abundant in [[aqueous]] environments and [[soil]], occupying a range of [[trophic level]]s. The group includes [[flagellate]]s (which move with the help of whip-like structures called [[flagella]]), [[ciliate]]s (which move by using hair-like structures called [[cilia]]) and [[amoeba]]e (which move by the use of foot-like structures called [[pseudopodia]]). Some protozoa are [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]], and do not move at all.\n\n=== Pellicle ===\nUnlike plants, fungi and most types of algae, protozoans do not typically have a rigid [[cell wall]], but are usually enveloped by elastic structures of membranes that permit movement of the cell. In some protozoans, such as the ciliates and [[euglenozoa]]ns, the cell is supported by a composite membranous envelope called the \"pellicle\". The pellicle gives some shape to the cell, especially during locomotion. Pellicles of protozoan organisms vary from flexible and elastic to fairly rigid.  In [[ciliate]]s and [[Apicomplexa]], the pellicle is supported by closely packed vesicles called alveoli. In [[euglenid]]s, it is formed from [[protein]] strips arranged spirally along the length of the body. Familiar examples of protists with a pellicle are the [[euglenoids]] and the ciliate ''[[Paramecium]]''. In some protozoa, the pellicle hosts [[Epibiont|epibiotic]] bacteria that adhere to the surface by their [[Pilus#fimbriae|fimbriae]] (attachment pili).<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/protozoainbiolog00calk#page/1008/mode/2up Protozoa in biological research<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[File:Dileptus_viridis_cyst.jpg|thumb|Resting cyst of ciliated protozoan ''Dileptus viridis''.]]\n\n=== Life cycle ===\n[[File:Toxoplasmosis life cycle en.svg|thumb|Life cycle of parasitic protozoan, ''Toxoplasma gondii'']]\nSome protozoa have two-phase life cycles, alternating between proliferative stages (e.g., [[trophozoite]]s) and dormant [[Microbial cyst|cysts]]. As cysts, protozoa can survive harsh conditions, such as exposure to extreme temperatures or harmful chemicals, or long periods without access to nutrients, water, or oxygen for periods of time. Being a cyst enables parasitic species to survive outside of a host, and allows their transmission from one host to another. When protozoa are in the form of [[trophozoite]]s (Greek ''tropho'' = to nourish), they actively feed. The conversion of a trophozoite to cyst form is known as encystation, while the process of transforming back into a trophozoite is known as excystation.\n\nAll protozoans reproduce (not all) asexually by [[binary fission]] or multiple fission. Many protozoan species exchange genetic material by sexual means (typically, through [[Isogamy#Conjugation|conjugation]]); however, sexuality is generally decoupled from the process of reproduction, and does not immediately result in increased population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/ca/academic/subjects/life-sciences/evolutionary-biology/sex-and-death-protozoa-history-obsession|title=Sex and Death in Protozoa|website=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=2015-06-09}}</ref>\n\nAlthough [[Origin and function of meiosis|meiotic sex]] is widespread among present day [[eukaryote]]s, it has, until recently, been unclear whether or not eukaryotes were sexual early in their evolution.  Due to recent advances in [[gene]] detection and other techniques, evidence has been found for some form of meiotic sex in an increasing number of protozoans of ancient lineage that diverged early in eukaryotic evolution.<ref>Bernstein H, Bernstein C (2013). Bernstein C, Bernstein H eds. ''Evolutionary Origin and Adaptive Function of Meiosis'. Meiosis. InTech. {{ISBN|978-953-51-1197-9}}''</ref>  (See [[Eukaryote#Reproduction|eukaryote reproduction]].)  Thus, such findings suggest that meiotic sex arose early in eukaryotic evolution. Examples of protozoan meiotic sexuality are described in the articles ''[[Amoebozoa]]'', ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'', ''[[Leishmania]]'', ''[[Plasmodium falciparum biology]]'', ''[[Paramecium]]'', ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', ''[[Trichomonas vaginalis]]'' and ''[[Trypanosoma brucei]]''.\n\n== Classification ==\n{{Further|wikispecies:Protozoa}}Historically, the Protozoa were classified as \"unicellular animals\", as distinct from the Protophyta, single-celled photosynthetic organisms (algae) which were considered primitive plants.

The other classes or subphyla of Protozoa were all [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]] groups composed of organisms that, despite similarities of appearance or way of life, were not necessarily closely related to one another.

This moved everyone else up in the rankings. In 1982, the IOC was convinced that the disqualification had been improper, as no protest against Thorpe's eligibility had been brought within the required 30 days and reinstated Thorpe's medals. The three medalists promoted were not retroactively demoted, leaving co-champions in these events.</ref>\n|-\n| [[Athletics at the 1912 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's decathlon|Men's decathlon]]\n|

The only exception was the [[France at the 2002 Winter Olympics|French]] judge, [[Marie-Reine Le Gougne]], who awarded the gold to the Russians. An investigation revealed that she had been pressured to give the gold to the Russian pair regardless of how they skated; in return the Russian judge would look favourably on the French entrants in the ice dancing competition.

This moved everyone else up in the rankings. In 1982, the IOC was convinced that the disqualification had been improper, as no protest against Thorpe's eligibility had been brought within the required 30 days and reinstated Thorpe's medals. The three medalists promoted were not retroactively demoted, leaving co-champions in these events.</ref>\n|-\n| [[Athletics at the 1912 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's decathlon|Men's decathlon]]\n|

The Canadians appeared to have skated well enough to win, yet the Russians were awarded the gold. The judging broke along [[Cold War]] lines with judges from former [[Communism|Communist]] countries favouring the Russian pair and judges from [[Western World|Western]] nations voting for the Canadians. The only exception was the [[France at the 2002 Winter Olympics|French]] judge, [[Marie-Reine Le Gougne]], who awarded the gold to the Russians. An investigation revealed that she had been pressured to give the gold to the Russian pair regardless of how they skated; in return the Russian judge would look favourably on the French entrants in the ice dancing competition. The IOC decided to award both pairs the gold medal in a second [[Olympic Games ceremony|medal ceremony]] held later in the Games.\n</ref>\n|-\n| {{GamesName|WOG|2010}}\n| [[Image:Biathlon pictogram.svg|25px]] [[Biathlon at the 2010 Winter Olympics|Biathlon]]\n| [[Biathlon at the 2010 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's individual|Men's individual]]\n| {{flagIOCmedalist|[[Emil Hegle Svendsen]]|NOR|2010 Winter}}\n| {{flagIOCmedalist|[[Ole Einar Bj\u00f8rndalen]]|NOR|2010 Winter}}<hr>{{flagIOCmedalist|[[Sergei Novikov (biathlete)|Sergey Novikov]]|BLR|2010 Winter}}\n| ''Not awarded''<br><span style=\"font-size:85%\">as there was a tie for silver.</span>\n| <ref>{{cite web|title=Biathlon at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Games: Men's 20 kilometres|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/winter/2010/BIA/mens-20-kilometres.html|website=Olympics at Sports-Reference.com|accessdate=24 November 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n|-\n|rowspan=2| {{GamesName|WOG|2014}}\n|rowspan=2| [[Image:Alpine skiing pictogram.svg|25px]] [[Alpine skiing at the 2014 Winter Olympics|Alpine skiing]]\n| [[Alpine skiing at the 2014 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's super-G|Men's super-G]]\n| {{flagIOCmedalist|[[Kjetil Jansrud]]|NOR|2014 Winter}}\n| {{flagIOCmedalist|[[Andrew Weibrecht]]|USA|2014 Winter}}\n| {{flagIOCmedalist|[[Jan Hudec]]|CAN|2014 Winter}}<hr>{{flagIOCmedalist|[[Bode Miller]]|USA|2014 Winter}}\n| <ref>{{cite web|title=Sochi 2014 super-G men -
