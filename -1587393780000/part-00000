With the new redesign, the bike lane is now on the right side of the street; it was formerly on the left side adjacent to the pedestrian plazas, causing conflicts between pedestrian and bicycle traffic.<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/2012-10-22-broadway-blvd-35-42.pdf Broadway Boulevard II]</ref>\n\nIn spring 2017, as part of a capital reconstruction of Worth Square, Broadway between 24th and 25th Street was converted to a \"[[Shared space|shared street]]\" where through vehicles are banned and delivery vehicles are restricted to {{convert|5|mph|km/h}}.

South of [[Columbus Circle]], it is a one-way southbound street. Since 2009, vehicular traffic has been banned at [[Times Square]] between [[47th Street (Manhattan)|47th]] and [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Streets]], and at [[Herald Square]] between 35th and 33rd Streets as part of a pilot program; the right-of-way is intact and reserved for cyclists and pedestrians. From the northern shore of Manhattan, Broadway crosses [[Spuyten Duyvil Creek]] via the [[Broadway Bridge (Manhattan)|Broadway Bridge]] and continues through [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] (a discontinuous portion of the borough of Manhattan) and [[the Bronx]] into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|U.S. 9]] continues to be known as Broadway until its junction with [[New York State Route 117|NY 117]].\n\n====Lower Manhattan====\n[[File:Upbroadway e.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A view up Broadway from Bowling Green, with the [[Chrysler Building]] visible in the background]]\n\nThe section of lower Broadway from its origin at Bowling Green to City Hall Park is the historical location for the city's [[ticker-tape parade]]s, and is sometimes called the \"[[#Canyon of Heroes|Canyon of Heroes]]\" during such events. West of Broadway, as far as [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]], was the city's fashionable residential area until circa 1825; landfill has more than tripled the area, and the [[Hudson River]] shore now lies far to the west, beyond [[Tribeca]] and [[Battery Park City]].\n\nBroadway marks the boundary between [[Greenwich Village]] to the west and the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] to the east, passing [[Astor Place]]. It is a short walk from there to [[New York University]] near [[Washington Square Park]], which is at the foot of [[Fifth Avenue]]. A bend in front of [[Grace Church (Manhattan)|Grace Church]] allegedly avoids an earlier tavern; from 10th Street it begins its long diagonal course across Manhattan, headed almost due north.\n\n====Midtown Manhattan====\n[[File:Bway.jpg|thumb|right|175px|A view of Broadway in 1909]]\n\nBecause Broadway preceded the grid that the [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]] imposed on the island, Broadway crosses [[midtown Manhattan]] diagonally, intersecting with both the east\u2013west streets and north\u2013south avenues. Broadway's intersections with avenues, marked by \"[[town square|squares]]\" (some merely triangular slivers of open space), have induced some interesting architecture, such as the [[Flatiron Building]].\n\nAt [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]], Broadway crosses [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]], merges with [[Park Avenue|Fourth Avenue]], and continues its diagonal uptown course from the Square's northwest corner; Union Square is the only location wherein the physical section of Broadway is discontinuous in Manhattan (other portions of Broadway in Manhattan are pedestrian-only plazas). At [[Madison Square]], the location of the Flatiron Building, Broadway crosses Fifth Avenue at [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]], and is discontinuous to vehicles for a one-block stretch between 24th and 25th Streets. At [[Greeley Square]] (West 33rd Street), Broadway crosses [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] (Avenue of the Americas), and is discontinuous to vehicles. [[Macy's Herald Square]] department store, one block north of the vehicular discontinuity, is located on the northwest corner of Broadway and West 34th Street and southwest corner of Broadway and West 35th Street; it is one of the largest [[department store]]s in the world.\n\n[[File:Broadway looking north from 48th Street Manhattan.jpeg|thumb|left|Broadway looking north from 48th Street in the Theater District]]\nOne famous stretch near [[Times Square]], where Broadway crosses Seventh Avenue in [[midtown Manhattan]], is the home of many [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[theatre (structure)|theatres]], housing an ever-changing array of commercial, large-scale plays, particularly [[musical theatre|musicals]]. This area of Manhattan is often called the [[Theater District, Manhattan|Theater District]] or the Great White Way, a nickname originating in the headline \"Found on the Great White Way\" in the edition of February 3, 1902 of the ''[[New York Evening Telegram]]''. The journalistic nickname was inspired by the millions of lights on theater [[Marquee (sign)|marquees]] and [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] advertisements that illuminate the area. After becoming the city's de facto [[red-light district]] in the 1960s and 1970s (as can be seen in the films ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]''), since the late 1980s Times Square has emerged as a family tourist center, in effect being [[Disneyfication|Disneyfied]] following the company's purchase and renovation of the [[New Amsterdam Theatre]] on 42nd Street in 1993.<ref>{{cite news|first=David W.|last=Dunlap|authorlink=David W.

For many years, all traffic on Broadway flowed on either side of this median and its subway entrance, and its uptown lanes went past it along the western edge of triangular Verdi Square. In 2001 and 2002, renovation of the historic 72nd Street station and the addition of a second subway control house and passenger shelter on an adjacent center median just north of 72nd Street, across from the original building, resulted in the creation of a public plaza with stone pavers and extensive seating, connecting the newer building with Verdi Square, and making it necessary to divert northbound traffic to Amsterdam Avenue for one block. While Broadway's southbound lanes at this intersection were unaffected by the new construction, its northbound lanes are no longer contiguous at this intersection. Drivers can either continue along Amsterdam Avenue to head uptown or turn left on West 73rd Street to resume traveling on Broadway.\n\nSeveral notable apartment buildings are in close proximity to this intersection, including [[The Ansonia]], its ornate architecture dominating the cityscape here.

The city decided that the experiment was successful and decided to make the change permanent in February 2010.

South of [[Columbus Circle]], it is a one-way southbound street. Since 2009, vehicular traffic has been banned at [[Times Square]] between [[47th Street (Manhattan)|47th]] and [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Streets]], and at [[Herald Square]] between 35th and 33rd Streets as part of a pilot program; the right-of-way is intact and reserved for cyclists and pedestrians. From the northern shore of Manhattan, Broadway crosses [[Spuyten Duyvil Creek]] via the [[Broadway Bridge (Manhattan)|Broadway Bridge]] and continues through [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] (a discontinuous portion of the borough of Manhattan) and [[the Bronx]] into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|U.S. 9]] continues to be known as Broadway until its junction with [[New York State Route 117|NY 117]].\n\n====Lower Manhattan====\n[[File:Upbroadway e.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A view up Broadway from Bowling Green, with the [[Chrysler Building]] visible in the background]]\n\nThe section of lower Broadway from its origin at Bowling Green to City Hall Park is the historical location for the city's [[ticker-tape parade]]s, and is sometimes called the \"[[#Canyon of Heroes|Canyon of Heroes]]\" during such events. West of Broadway, as far as [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]], was the city's fashionable residential area until circa 1825; landfill has more than tripled the area, and the [[Hudson River]] shore now lies far to the west, beyond [[Tribeca]] and [[Battery Park City]].\n\nBroadway marks the boundary between [[Greenwich Village]] to the west and the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] to the east, passing [[Astor Place]]. It is a short walk from there to [[New York University]] near [[Washington Square Park]], which is at the foot of [[Fifth Avenue]].

Broadway's intersections with avenues, marked by \"[[town square|squares]]\" (some merely triangular slivers of open space), have induced some interesting architecture, such as the [[Flatiron Building]].\n\nAt [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]], Broadway crosses [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]], merges with [[Park Avenue|Fourth Avenue]], and continues its diagonal uptown course from the Square's northwest corner; Union Square is the only location wherein the physical section of Broadway is discontinuous in Manhattan (other portions of Broadway in Manhattan are pedestrian-only plazas). At [[Madison Square]], the location of the Flatiron Building, Broadway crosses Fifth Avenue at [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]], and is discontinuous to vehicles for a one-block stretch between 24th and 25th Streets. At [[Greeley Square]] (West 33rd Street), Broadway crosses [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] (Avenue of the Americas), and is discontinuous to vehicles. [[Macy's Herald Square]] department store, one block north of the vehicular discontinuity, is located on the northwest corner of Broadway and West 34th Street and southwest corner of Broadway and West 35th Street; it is one of the largest [[department store]]s in the world.\n\n[[File:Broadway looking north from 48th Street Manhattan.jpeg|thumb|left|Broadway looking north from 48th Street in the Theater District]]\nOne famous stretch near [[Times Square]], where Broadway crosses Seventh Avenue in [[midtown Manhattan]], is the home of many [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[theatre (structure)|theatres]], housing an ever-changing array of commercial, large-scale plays, particularly [[musical theatre|musicals]]. This area of Manhattan is often called the [[Theater District, Manhattan|Theater District]] or the Great White Way, a nickname originating in the headline \"Found on the Great White Way\" in the edition of February 3, 1902 of the ''[[New York Evening Telegram]]''. The journalistic nickname was inspired by the millions of lights on theater [[Marquee (sign)|marquees]] and [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] advertisements that illuminate the area. After becoming the city's de facto [[red-light district]] in the 1960s and 1970s (as can be seen in the films ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]''), since the late 1980s Times Square has emerged as a family tourist center, in effect being [[Disneyfication|Disneyfied]] following the company's purchase and renovation of the [[New Amsterdam Theatre]] on 42nd Street in 1993.<ref>{{cite news|first=David W.|last=Dunlap|authorlink=David W.

Named [[Verdi Square]] in 1921 for its monument to Italian composer [[Giuseppe Verdi]], which was erected in 1909, this triangular sliver of public space was designated a Scenic Landmark by the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1974, one of nine city parks that have received the designation.<ref>[https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/verdi-square Verdi Square], [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]].

For many years, all traffic on Broadway flowed on either side of this median and its subway entrance, and its uptown lanes went past it along the western edge of triangular Verdi Square. In 2001 and 2002, renovation of the historic 72nd Street station and the addition of a second subway control house and passenger shelter on an adjacent center median just north of 72nd Street, across from the original building, resulted in the creation of a public plaza with stone pavers and extensive seating, connecting the newer building with Verdi Square, and making it necessary to divert northbound traffic to Amsterdam Avenue for one block. While Broadway's southbound lanes at this intersection were unaffected by the new construction, its northbound lanes are no longer contiguous at this intersection. Drivers can either continue along Amsterdam Avenue to head uptown or turn left on West 73rd Street to resume traveling on Broadway.\n\nSeveral notable apartment buildings are in close proximity to this intersection, including [[The Ansonia]], its ornate architecture dominating the cityscape here.

Almost lifeless, the tired entertainers of the night clubs and their friends straggle to their rooms, taximen compare notes and earnings, the vast street scene has had its curtain call, the play is over.\n\nDear old Broadway, for many years have I dwelt on your borders. I have known the quiet note of your dawn. Even earlier I would take my coffee at Martin's, at 54th Street\u2013now, alas, vanished\u2013where I would see creatures of the night life before they disappeared with the dawn.\n\nOne night a celebrated female impersonator came to the restaurant in all his regalia, directly from a club across the street.

Then he went back to the club, only to lament under his bitter tears, \"See how they've ruined my dress!\"\n\nGone are the old-time Broadway oyster bars and chop houses that were the survivors of a tradition of their sporting patrons, the bon vivants of Manhattan.

While renovating, they discover a large, steel door that leads to a seemingly empty room. After experiencing frequent electrical shortages, the couple call an electrician out to the property to learn that the wiring in the home is comprised of a large, tangled mass that runs along the walls and floorboards of the property. As the electrician drives off, he exclaims his surprise that the property finally sold considering the previous owners were murdered on site. \n\nThat evening, Matt finds himself unable to sleep and ends up drinking while researching the murder. He learns that the killer's name is John Doe, and that he is still alive, housed in a psychiatric hospital. He stumbles into the room and drunkenly wishes for another bottle of alcohol, which the room promptly grants him. The next morning, Kate finds Matt in the room surrounded by many expensive paintings. He encourages her to wish for money- and she does, wishing for millions. Over the next several days, the couple quits their jobs and parties in the room, which continuously grants their wishes and desires.\n\nKate begins to fall under a depression when she realizes that nothing they wish for has any real value, stating that she can just get \"another, and another, and another\". To cheer her up, Matt tells her he wants to try for a child, but she becomes angry, revealing to the audience that the couple experienced two miscarriages in the past. She exclaims that she can't put herself through that pain again and storms out of the room. Matt walks past the bedroom moments later to discover that in her sadness, Kate used the room to wish for a son. Panicked, he tells her that what she has done is wrong and that she needs to force the room to take it back. When the couple is unable to bring themselves to wish away the child, Matt leaves the home in search of John Doe.\n\nAt the hospital, Matt speaks with John Doe and doesn't learn much, but is warned that he and his wife should leave the house and forget about the room. Matt drives away only to find that the money he placed in his pocket has turned to ash. He tests his theory at home by placing his Van Gogh painting partially over the threshold. As he suspected, anything that leaves the home experiences rapid aging and decay. Just as he comes to this realization, Kate tells Matt she is taking the baby out for some fresh air. He warns her not to do so but she ignores him, only to panic when the baby quickly ages into a young child. \n\nOver the next three months, the couple\u2019s marriage begins to fall apart as Kate attempts to parent the child, whom she calls \"Shane\", while Matt chooses to ignore the child entirely. Kate experiences frustration daily as she is inexperienced and unable to properly discipline the child. Shane frequently grows impatient with his mother as she refuses to let him outside, citing \u201cgerms and bacteria\u201d rather then telling him the truth. \u00a0Days later, Matt finds that Shane has discovered the powers of the room, prompting a tense fight between the couple. They are interrupted by a call from John Doe, who reveals to Matt that he was a child wish granted by the room, and in order for Shane to live, Kate must die. Kate overhears the conversation and flees the home in an attempt to crash her car but cannot bring herself to do so. When she returns, the couple reunite tearfully and have sex in the kitchen, unknowingly being watched by Shane.\n\nThe next morning, they are awoken by the slamming of the front door and discover to their horror that Shane went outside and aged himself into a grown man. Though he appears to be an adult, he still has the mindset of a child. He angrily exclaims that Kate lied to him about everything. He threatens the couple with Shane's gun but is distracted by Kate telling him she promised they could be together forever. Matt rushes Shane and knocks him to the floor, pushing his wife into the piano during the scuffle. When she awakens, Matt tells her he killed Shane while they fought for the gun. Though she is heartbroken by the news, she accepts the outcome. As they sit in the kitchen, she tells him she can no longer bear to live in the house, but is surprised when Matt disagrees, citing their lack of work and that they have \u201cno where else to go\u201d. He begins crunching on the ice in his drink and Kate realizes in horror that he is not her true husband- that he is Shane in disguise. She pushes him away, but Shane overpowers and attempts to rape her. \n\nAs this is happening, the real Matt comes to and quickly realizes what happened. Unable to break through the locked door, Matt tunnels through the walls next to the room and manages to break into the alternate \u201coutside\u201d that Shane created. He locates their replicated property and breaks into the home just as Shane is assaulting Kate. The two Matts come face-to-face with one another and try to sway Kate to their side. After pushing the fake Matt down the stairs, the couple flees the house makes their way back to the room. They manage to trick Shane into going outside into the real world. Locking the door behind her, Kate tearfully watches as her son ages rapidly, crumbling into ash. \n\nA month later, the couple has abandoned the home and moved to a nearby motel. The film ends as Kate stares at the result on a positive pregnancy test, unsure if the child is Matt\u2019s or Shane\u2019s. \u00a0\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Olga Kurylenko]] as Kate\n*[[Kevin Janssens (actor)|Kevin Janssens]] as Matt\n*Joshua Wilson as Shane (child)\n*John Flanders as John Doe\n*Francis Chapman as Shane (teenager)\n*Vince Drews as Chet\n*Marianne Bourg as Suzanne\n*Oscar Lesage as Henry\n*[[Carole Weyers]] as Mrs. Schaeffer\n*Micha\u00ebl Kahya as Mr. Schaeffer\n\n==Distribution==\nIn 2019, the film was officially selected for [[Hof International Film Festival]] (Germany), Sitges International Film Festival of Catalonia (Spain), and [[Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival]] (South Korea), European Fantastic Film Festival (France), Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival (Belgium), [[Neuch\u00e2tel International Fantastic Film Festival]] (Switzerland), [[Ostend Film Festival]] (Belgium).\n\n[[Shudder (streaming service)|Shudder]]\u2019s Emily Gotto said, \"From its Twilight Zone-esque hook, to its stylish, scary destination, The Room is a stirring, eerie thriller primed to knock Shudder members out.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Exclusive: Christian Volckman's THE ROOM Heading to Shudder |url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/296540/exclusive-christian-volckmans-the-room-heading-to-shudder/ |website=[[Dread Central]] |accessdate=13 December 2019 |date=17 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|http://www.versusproduction.be/films/the-room}}\n*{{IMDB title|8485364}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Room, The (2019 film)}}\n[[Category:2019 horror films]]\n[[Category:French horror films]]\n[[Category:French films]]\n[[Category:Belgian films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:2019 films]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox film\n| name           = The Room\n| image          = The Room 2019 poster.jpg\n| alt            = \n| caption        = Theatrical release poster\n| film_name      = \n| director       = [[Christian Volckman]]\n| producer       = Yael Fogiel, Laetitia Gonzalez\n| writer         = [[Christian Volckman]], Sabrina B.

While renovating, they discover a large, steel door that leads to a seemingly empty room. After experiencing frequent electrical shortages, the couple call an electrician out to the property to learn that the wiring in the home is comprised of a large, tangled mass that runs along the walls and floorboards of the property. As the electrician drives off, he exclaims his surprise that the property finally sold considering the previous owners were murdered on site. \n\nThat evening, Matt finds himself unable to sleep and ends up drinking while researching the murder.
