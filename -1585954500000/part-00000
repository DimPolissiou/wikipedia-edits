It is best known for the sprawling resort [[Atlantis Paradise Island|Atlantis]] with its extensive water park rides, pools, beach, restaurants, walk-in aquarium and casinos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantis.com/|title=Discover Atlantis Resorts and Residences in Dubai and Atlantis Sanya|work=atlantis.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kuoni.co.uk/bahamas/hotels/atlantis-paradise-island-Bahamas|title=Atlantis, Paradise Island, Bahamas|work=@KuoniTravelUK}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/travel/28hours.html|title=36 Hours in Nassau, the Bahamas|date=28 October 2007|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nParadise Island is connected to the island of New Providence by two bridges that cross Nassau Harbour.  The first was built in 1966 by [[Resorts International]], and the second in the late 1990s.\n\n==Recent history==\n\n===Paradise Island Airport===\nA small airstrip existed on the island from 1989 to 1999 to serve the resort. Prior to 1989 the airport was a seaplane base with a ramp for aircraft to leave the water. In 1989 a {{convert|3000|ft|m|adj=on|order=flip}} runway was added to the airport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1989-03-12/features/8901140159_1_paradise-island-resort-nassau-international-airport-runway|title=New Planes Help Deliver Visitors To Paradise Island|work=tribunedigital-sunsentinel}}</ref>\nThe airport's codes were: IATA: PID  ICAO: MYPI. Both [[Paradise Island Airlines]] and [[Chalk's International Airlines]] were the main tenants of the airport. [[US Airways Express]] also served the airport from [[Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport]].\n\nThe [[STOL]] capable [[de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7]] turboprop operated by Paradise Island Airlines as well the [[Grumman G-73 Mallard]] [[amphibian aircraft]] flown by Chalk's International Airlines both served the airstrip which closed in 1999. The airfield  and runway have since been removed and replaced with an 18-hole luxury golf course surrounded by one of the wealthiest neighborhoods on the island. The area goes by the name \"Ocean Club\" with property prices as high as 40+ million dollars.\n\n===Purchase by Huntington Hartford and development as a resort===\n[[Huntington Hartford]], the [[A&P supermarket]] heir, arrived on Hog Island in 1959. Hartford bought Hog Island from [[Axel Wenner-Gren]] and changed the name to Paradise Island.  He hired the [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] architect John Volk and built the Ocean Club, Cafe Martinique, Hurricane Hole, the Golf Course, among other island landmarks. He also acquired and installed the Cloisters, a 14th-century French [[Augustinian]] monastery originally purchased in [[Montr\u00e9jeau]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.montrejeau-pyrenees.com/TempSite/3698.asp?rang= |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714113525/http://www.montrejeau-pyrenees.com/TempSite/3698.asp?rang= |archivedate=2011-07-14 }}  See point 16</ref> and dismantled by [[William Randolph Hearst]] in the 1920s. He hired [[Gary Player]] to be the golf pro and [[Pancho Gonzales]] to be the tennis pro. His opening of Paradise Island in 1962 was covered in ''[[Newsweek]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazines. He hired the staff from Eden Roc at Hotel Du Cap to work off season at the Ocean Club.  He had the fireworks for the opening party flown in from the South of France. He had a flag and Paradise Beach was featured on Bahamian three-dollar notes in 1966 (introduced as a close equivalent to the Bahamian Pound, which was replaced at the rate of $1 = \u00a37, so $3 = \u00a321).\n\n===Development as a gambling resort===\nHuntington Hartford met James M. Crosby (1927\u20131986) through Huntington's bodyguard Sy Alter. Sy Alter met Jim Crosby at the Colony Club in Palm Beach. Huntington Hartford obtained the gambling licence for Paradise Island and included Jim Crosby as an extra investor. Jim Crosby and Jack Davis then formed a company, [[Resorts International]], to continue developing Paradise Island.<ref>Adam Bernstein, \"Huntington Hartford Lost Millions on Investments\", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', May 20, 2008.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Block|first=Alan A. |title=Masters of Paradise|year=1998 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=1-56000-971-3 |page=68 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=trFcGY20LX8C&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=paradise+island+gambling+license&ct=result}}</ref> Recognizing the business potential of the Bahamas, they were the first to establish major resort development, and often offered above-average salaries to Bahamanian employees.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}} The two continued to develop Paradise Island. They built the bridge to Nassau and the first large-scale resorts. \n\nParadise Island was purchased in the 1980s for $79 million, then sold to [[Merv Griffin]] for $400 million.  It was last sold for $125 million to the current owner, [[Sol Kerzner]] (\u2020 March 2020).

The first was built in 1966 by [[Resorts International]], and the second in the late 1990s.\n\n==Recent history==\n\n===Paradise Island Airport===\nA small airstrip existed on the island from 1989 to 1999 to serve the resort. Prior to 1989 the airport was a seaplane base with a ramp for aircraft to leave the water. In 1989 a {{convert|3000|ft|m|adj=on|order=flip}} runway was added to the airport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1989-03-12/features/8901140159_1_paradise-island-resort-nassau-international-airport-runway|title=New Planes Help Deliver Visitors To Paradise Island|work=tribunedigital-sunsentinel}}</ref>\nBoth [[Paradise Island Airlines]] and [[Chalk's International Airlines]] were the main tenants of the airport.\n\nThe [[STOL]] capable [[de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7]] turboprop operated by Paradise Island Airlines as well the [[Grumman G-73 Mallard]] [[amphibian aircraft]] flown by Chalk's International Airlines both served the airstrip which closed in 1999. The airfield  and runway have since been removed and replaced with an 18-hole luxury golf course surrounded by one of the wealthiest neighborhoods on the island. The area goes by the name \"Ocean Club\" with property prices as high as 40+ million dollars.\n\n===Purchase by Huntington Hartford and development as a resort===\n[[Huntington Hartford]], the [[A&P supermarket]] heir, arrived on Hog Island in 1959. Hartford bought Hog Island from [[Axel Wenner-Gren]] and changed the name to Paradise Island.  He hired the [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] architect John Volk and built the Ocean Club, Cafe Martinique, Hurricane Hole, the Golf Course, among other island landmarks. He also acquired and installed the Cloisters, a 14th-century French [[Augustinian]] monastery originally purchased in [[Montr\u00e9jeau]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.montrejeau-pyrenees.com/TempSite/3698.asp?rang= |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714113525/http://www.montrejeau-pyrenees.com/TempSite/3698.asp?rang= |archivedate=2011-07-14 }}  See point 16</ref> and dismantled by [[William Randolph Hearst]] in the 1920s. He hired [[Gary Player]] to be the golf pro and [[Pancho Gonzales]] to be the tennis pro. His opening of Paradise Island in 1962 was covered in ''[[Newsweek]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazines. He hired the staff from Eden Roc at Hotel Du Cap to work off season at the Ocean Club.  He had the fireworks for the opening party flown in from the South of France. He had a flag and Paradise Beach was featured on Bahamian three-dollar notes in 1966 (introduced as a close equivalent to the Bahamian Pound, which was replaced at the rate of $1 = \u00a37, so $3 = \u00a321).\n\n===Development as a gambling resort===\nHuntington Hartford met James M. Crosby (1927\u20131986) through Huntington's bodyguard Sy Alter. Sy Alter met Jim Crosby at the Colony Club in Palm Beach. Huntington Hartford obtained the gambling licence for Paradise Island and included Jim Crosby as an extra investor.

Kosmos 122 was the first announced Russian meteorological satellite and the last in a series of prototype meteorological satellites that included [[Kosmos 44]] (28 August 1964), [[Kosmos 58]] (26 February 1965), [[Kosmos 100]] (17 December 1965), and [[Kosmos 118]] (11 May 1966).<ref name=\"Cosmos\">{{cite web|title=Cosmos 122: Display 1966-057A|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1966-057A|website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov|publisher=NASA|date=27 February 2020|accessdate=30 March 2020}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> It was the last meteorological satellite launched from the Baikonur site with a Vostok 2M launch vehicle at an orbital inclination of 65.0\u00b0, and it provided a transition from the prototype series to the Kosmos \"[[Meteor (satellite)|Meteor]]\" experimental weather satellite system.<ref name=\"Cosmos\"/> The deployment of two other satellites, [[Kosmos 144]] (28 February 1967) and [[Kosmos 156]] (27 April 1967), helped create the first Soviet [[weather forecasting]] network.<ref name=\"Springer\">Meteorological Satellite Systems, 1.

Space Chronicle: JBIS 57 (2004): pp. 56-102. Web. 17 April 2016.</ref> These satellites were used until 1969 when they were replaced with an upgraded model officially called [[Meteor (satellite)|Meteor]].<ref name=\"Springer\"/>\n\n==Spacecraft==\nThe satellite was in the form of a large cylindrical capsule, {{convert|5|m}} long and {{convert|1.5|m}} in diameter. Two large solar cell panels of three segments each were deployed from opposite sides of the cylinder after satellite separation from the launch vehicle. The solar panels were rotated to constantly face the sun during satellite daytime by means of a sun sensor-controlled drive mechanism fitted in the top end of the center body.<ref name=\"Cosmos\"/>\n\nThe meteorological instruments were housed in a hermetically sealed compartment located in the lower part of the capsule, while the basic satellite servicing systems were contained in a special hermetically sealed compartment in the upper part of the capsule. Data were transmitted to earth at a frequency of 90 MHz by means of a steerable high-gain parabolic antenna that was attached to the center section of the satellite body by a long arm. The satellite was triaxially stabilized by a series of inertial flywheels, driven by electric motors, whose kinetic energy was dampened by torques produced by electromagnets interacting with the earth's magnetic field.<ref name=\"Cosmos\"/>\n\nKosmos 122 was oriented by Earth sensors with one of its axes directed earthward along the local vertical, a second oriented along the orbital velocity vector, and a third oriented perpendicular to the orbital plane. This orientation ensured that the optical axes of the instruments were constantly directed earthward.<ref name=\"Cosmos\"/>\n\n==Instruments==\nThe instrumentation consisted of two vidicon cameras for daytime cloud cover pictures, a high-resolution scanning infrared (IR) radiometer for nighttime and daytime imaging of the Earth and clouds, and an array of narrow-angle and wide-angle radiometers for measuring the intensity of radiation reflected from the clouds and oceans, the surface temperatures of the Earth and cloud tops, and the total flux of thermal energy from the Earth-atmosphere system into space, respectively. The experiment terminated operations in October 1966.<ref name=\"Cosmos\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Instrument <ref name=\"Hendrickx\"/> !! Number of Spectral Bands !!

The instrumentation consisted of two identical vidicon cameras that were mounted in the satellite base and were directed toward the Earth. Each camera viewed a {{convert|500|km}} by {{convert|500|km}} area \u2014 one to the left and the other to the right of nadir \u2014 with a resolution of {{convert|1.25|km}} at nadir from a satellite altitude of {{convert|600|km}} to {{convert|700|km}}. The cameras took a one-frame image of the Earth's cloud cover with slight overlapping of successive frames to provide continuous coverage. The cameras switched on automatically any time the sun was more than 5\u00b0 above the horizon. Because the Earth illumination varied so much, automatic sensors adjusted the camera apertures to produce high-quality pictures under a variety of illumination conditions. The image formed by each vidicon tube either was transmitted directly to the ground if the satellite was in radio contact with one of two ground stations or was recorded on magnetic tape for later transmission if the satellite was beyond the zone of radio communication.<ref name=\"Experiment1\">{{cite web|title=Cosmos 122: Experiment 1966-057A-01 |url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1966-057A-01|website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov|publisher=NASA|date=27 February 2020|accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe TV images received by these ground stations were processed and transmitted to the Hydrometeorological Center in [[Moscow]], where they were analyzed and used in various forecast and analysis products. The pictures were archived at the Hydrometeorological Center. The Kosmos 122 cameras, although having 2.5 times the resolution of those carried on the [[Television Infrared Observation Satellite|ESSA]] satellites, could not provide continuous overlapping global coverage as do the ESSA cameras owing to the lower orbit of the Kosmos 122 satellite ({{convert|650|km}} compared to {{convert|1400|km}}). Thus, to close the gaps in coverage, at least two satellites were required in the weather satellite system. In addition, cloud cover mosaics were produced from 10 or more individual cloud cover pictures at the Hydrometeorological Center to provide a more comprehensive view of global weather systems.<ref name=\"Experiment1\"/>\n\nSome of the individual pictures and the cloud mosaics were transmitted to various foreign meteorological centers as part of an international meteorological data exchange program. The United States received some of these pictures at the National Environmental Satellite Service (NESS) in Suitland, Maryland, via the \"cold line\" facsimile link with Moscow. Pictures were transmitted to NESS from September 11, 1966, through October 26, 1966. These pictures were archived at NESS for 1 yr and then, unless of unusual interest, were discarded.<ref name=\"Experiment1\"/>\n\n===Scanning high-resolution infrared radiometer===\nThe Kosmos 122 high-resolution scanning [[infrared]] (IR) radiometer was designed to make measurements of cloud distribution and snow and ice cover on the dayside and nightside of the earth. The radiometer measured the outgoing radiation from the Earth-atmosphere system in the 8 to 12-\u00b5m atmospheric window. Measurements made in this spectral region permitted the construction of brightness patterns of the thermal relief and determination of equivalent radiation temperatures of the earth's surface and cloud tops.

Kosmos 122 was the first announced Russian meteorological satellite and the last in a series of prototype meteorological satellites that included [[Kosmos 44]] (28 August 1964), [[Kosmos 58]] (26 February 1965), [[Kosmos 100]] (17 December 1965), and [[Kosmos 118]] (11 May 1966).<ref name=\"Cosmos\">{{cite web|title=Cosmos 122: Display 1966-057A|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1966-057A|website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov|publisher=NASA|date=27 February 2020|accessdate=30 March 2020}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> It was the last meteorological satellite launched from the Baikonur site with a Vostok 2M launch vehicle at an orbital inclination of 65.0\u00b0, and it provided a transition from the prototype series to the Kosmos \"[[Meteor (satellite)|Meteor]]\" experimental weather satellite system.<ref name=\"Cosmos\"/> The deployment of two other satellites, [[Kosmos 144]] (28 February 1967) and [[Kosmos 156]] (27 April 1967), helped create the first Soviet [[weather forecasting]] network.<ref name=\"Springer\">Meteorological Satellite Systems, 1.

Two large solar cell panels of three segments each were deployed from opposite sides of the cylinder after satellite separation from the launch vehicle. The solar panels were rotated to constantly face the sun during satellite daytime by means of a sun sensor-controlled drive mechanism fitted in the top end of the center body.<ref name=\"Cosmos\"/>\n\nThe meteorological instruments were housed in a hermetically sealed compartment located in the lower part of the capsule, while the basic satellite servicing systems were contained in a special hermetically sealed compartment in the upper part of the capsule. Data were transmitted to earth at a frequency of 90 MHz by means of a steerable high-gain parabolic antenna that was attached to the center section of the satellite body by a long arm. The satellite was triaxially stabilized by a series of inertial flywheels, driven by electric motors, whose kinetic energy was dampened by torques produced by electromagnets interacting with the earth's magnetic field.<ref name=\"Cosmos\"/>\n\nKosmos 122 was oriented by Earth sensors with one of its axes directed earthward along the local vertical, a second oriented along the orbital velocity vector, and a third oriented perpendicular to the orbital plane. This orientation ensured that the optical axes of the instruments were constantly directed earthward.<ref name=\"Cosmos\"/>\n\n==Instruments==\nThe instrumentation consisted of two vidicon cameras for daytime cloud cover pictures, a high-resolution scanning infrared (IR) radiometer for nighttime and daytime imaging of the Earth and clouds, and an array of narrow-angle and wide-angle radiometers for measuring the intensity of radiation reflected from the clouds and oceans, the surface temperatures of the Earth and cloud tops, and the total flux of thermal energy from the Earth-atmosphere system into space, respectively.

The instrumentation consisted of two identical vidicon cameras that were mounted in the satellite base and were directed toward the Earth. Each camera viewed a {{convert|500|km}} by {{convert|500|km}} area \u2014 one to the left and the other to the right of nadir \u2014 with a resolution of {{convert|1.25|km}} at nadir from a satellite altitude of {{convert|600|km}} to {{convert|700|km}}. The cameras took a one-frame image of the Earth's cloud cover with slight overlapping of successive frames to provide continuous coverage. The cameras switched on automatically any time the sun was more than 5\u00b0 above the horizon. Because the Earth illumination varied so much, automatic sensors adjusted the camera apertures to produce high-quality pictures under a variety of illumination conditions. The image formed by each vidicon tube either was transmitted directly to the ground if the satellite was in radio contact with one of two ground stations or was recorded on magnetic tape for later transmission if the satellite was beyond the zone of radio communication.<ref name=\"Experiment1\">{{cite web|title=Cosmos 122: Experiment 1966-057A-01 |url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1966-057A-01|website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov|publisher=NASA|date=27 February 2020|accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe TV images received by these ground stations were processed and transmitted to the Hydrometeorological Center in Moscow, where they were analyzed and used in various forecast and analysis products. The pictures were archived at the Hydrometeorological Center. The Kosmos 122 cameras, although having 2.5 times the resolution of those carried on the ESSA satellites, could not provide continuous overlapping global coverage as do the ESSA cameras owing to the lower orbit of the Kosmos 122 satellite ({{convert|650|km}} compared to {{convert|1400|km}}). Thus, to close the gaps in coverage, at least two satellites were required in the weather satellite system. In addition, cloud cover mosaics were produced from 10 or more individual cloud cover pictures at the Hydrometeorological Center to provide a more comprehensive view of global weather systems.<ref name=\"Experiment1\"/>\n\nSome of the individual pictures and the cloud mosaics were transmitted to various foreign meteorological centers as part of an international meteorological data exchange program.

While common meanings of the word \"[[wikt:lift#English|lift]]\" suggest that lift opposes gravity, aerodynamic lift can be in any direction. When an aircraft is [[cruise (flight)|cruising]] for example, lift does oppose gravity, but lift occurs at an angle when climbing, descending or banking. On high-speed cars, the lift force is directed downwards (called \"down-force\") to keep the car stable on the road.\n\nLift can also occur in a different way if the air is not still, especially if there is an updraft due to heat (\"thermals\") or wind blowing along sloping terrain or other meteorological conditions.

The process which creates lift also causes some drag.\n\n====Lift-to-drag ratio====\n[[File:Drag curves for aircraft in flight.svg|thumb|Speed and drag relationships for a typical aircraft]]\n{{main article|Lift-to-drag ratio}}\nAerodynamic lift is created by the motion of an aerodynamic object (wing) through the air, which due to its shape and angle deflects the air. For sustained straight and level flight, lift must be equal and opposite to weight. In general, long narrow wings are able deflect a large amount of air at a slow speed, whereas smaller wings need a higher forward speed to deflect an equivalent amount of air and thus generate an equivalent amount of lift. Large cargo aircraft tend to use longer wings with higher angles of attack, whereas supersonic aircraft tend to have short wings and rely heavily on high forward speed to generate lift.\n\nHowever, this lift (deflection) process inevitably causes a retarding force called drag. Because lift and drag are both aerodynamic forces, the ratio of lift to drag is an indication of the aerodynamic efficiency of the airplane. The lift to drag ratio is the L/D ratio, pronounced \"L over D ratio.\" An airplane has a high L/D ratio if it produces a large amount of lift or a small amount of drag. The lift/drag ratio is determined by dividing the lift coefficient by the drag coefficient, CL/CD. <ref>The Beginner's Guide to Aeronautics - NASA Glenn Research Center   https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/ldrat.html</ref>\n\nThe lift coefficient Cl is equal to the lift L divided by the (density r times half the velocity V squared times the wing area A). [Cl = L / (A * .5 * r * V^2)] The lift coefficient is also affected by the compressibility of the air, which is much greater at higher speeds, so velocity V is not a linear function. Compressibility is also affected by the shape of the aircraft surfaces.\n<ref>The Beginner's Guide to Aeronautics - NASA Glenn Research Center   https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/liftco.html </ref>\n\nThe drag coefficient Cd is equal to the drag D divided by the (density r times half the velocity V squared times the reference area A). [Cd = D / (A * .5 * r * V^2)] \n<ref>The Beginner's Guide to Aeronautics - NASA Glenn Research Center   https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/dragco.html</ref>\n\nLift-to-drag ratios for practical aircraft vary from about 4:1 for vehicles and birds with relatively short wings, up to 60:1 or more for vehicles with very long wings, such as gliders. A greater angle of attack relative to the forward movement also increases the extent of deflection, and thus generates extra lift. However a greater angle of attack also generates extra drag. \n\nLift/drag ratio also determines the glide ratio and gliding range. Since the glide ratio is based only on the relationship of the aerodynamics forces acting on the aircraft, aircraft weight will not affect it. The only effect weight has is to vary the time that the aircraft will glide for \u2013 a heavier aircraft gliding at a higher airspeed will arrive at the same touchdown point in a shorter time. <ref>The Beginner's Guide to Aeronautics - NASA Glenn Research Center   \nhttps://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/ldrat.html</ref>\n\n====Buoyancy====\n{{main article|Buoyancy}}\nAir pressure acting up against an object in air is greater than the pressure above pushing down. The buoyancy, in both cases, is equal to the weight of fluid displaced - [[Archimedes' principle]] holds for air just as it does for water.\n\nA cubic meter of air at ordinary [[atmospheric pressure]] and room temperature has a mass of about 1.2 kilograms, so its weight is about 12 [[Newton (unit)|newtons]]. Therefore, any 1-cubic-meter object in air is buoyed up with a force of 12 newtons. If the mass of the 1-cubic-meter object is greater than 1.2 kilograms (so that its weight is greater than 12 newtons), it falls to the ground when released. If an object of this size has a mass less than 1.2 kilograms, it rises in the air. Any object that has a mass that is less than the mass of an equal volume of air will rise in air - in other words, any object less dense than air will rise.\n\n====Thrust to weight ratio====\n{{main article|Thrust-to-weight ratio}}\n'''Thrust-to-weight ratio''' is, as its name suggests, the ratio of instantaneous [[thrust]] to [[weight]] (where weight means weight at the [[Earth]]'s standard acceleration <math>g_0</math>).<ref name=\"sutton\">Sutton and Biblarz 2000, p. 442.

The three critical flight dynamics parameters are the angles of rotation in three [[dimensions]] about the vehicle's [[center of mass]], known as ''pitch'', ''roll'' and ''yaw'' (See [[Tait-Bryan rotations]] for an explanation).\n\nThe control of these dimensions can involve a [[horizontal stabilizer]] (i.e. \"a tail\"), [[ailerons]] and other movable aerodynamic devices which control angular stability i.e. flight attitude (which in turn affects [[altitude]], [[Aircraft heading|heading]]). Wings are often angled slightly upwards- they have \"positive [[Dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral angle]]\" which gives inherent roll stabilization.\n\n===Energy efficiency===\n{{main article|propulsive efficiency}}\nTo create thrust so as to be able to gain height, and to push through the air to overcome the drag associated with lift all takes energy.

Conventional aircraft accelerate along the ground until sufficient lift is generated for [[takeoff]], and reverse the process for [[landing]]. Some aircraft can take off at low speed; this is called a short takeoff. Some aircraft such as helicopters and Harrier jump jets can take off and land vertically. Rockets also usually take off and land vertically, but some designs can land horizontally.\n\n==Guidance, navigation and control==\n{{main article|Guidance, navigation and control}}\n\n===Navigation===\n[[Navigation]] is the systems necessary to calculate current position (e.g. [[compass]], [[GPS]], [[LORAN]], [[star tracker]], [[inertial measurement unit]], and [[altimeter]]).\n\nIn aircraft, successful [[air navigation]] involves piloting an aircraft from place to place without getting lost, breaking the laws applying to aircraft, or endangering the safety of those on board or on the [[Earth|ground]].\n\nThe techniques used for navigation in the air will depend on whether the aircraft is flying under the [[visual flight rules]] (VFR) or the [[instrument flight rules]] (IFR). In the latter case, the [[aviator|pilot]] will navigate exclusively using [[flight instruments|instruments]] and [[radio navigation aid]]s such as beacons, or as directed under [[radar]] control by [[air traffic control]]. In the VFR case, a pilot will largely navigate using [[dead reckoning]] combined with visual observations (known as [[pilotage]]), with reference to appropriate maps. This may be supplemented using radio navigation aids.\n\n===Guidance===\n{{main article|Guidance system}}\nA '''guidance system''' is a device or group of devices used in the [[navigation]] of a [[ship]], [[aircraft]], [[missile]], [[rocket]], [[satellite]], or other moving object. Typically, guidance is responsible for the calculation of the vector (i.e., direction, velocity) toward an objective.\n\n===Control===\n\n{{main article|Flight control system}}\nA conventional fixed-wing '''aircraft flight control system''' consists of [[flight control surfaces]], the respective cockpit controls, connecting linkages, and the necessary operating mechanisms to control an aircraft's direction in flight. [[Aircraft engine controls]] are also considered as flight controls as they change speed.\n\n====Traffic====\nIn the case of aircraft, air traffic is controlled by [[air traffic control]] systems.\n\n[[Collision avoidance (spacecraft)|Collision avoidance]] is the process of controlling spacecraft to try to prevent collisions.\n\n==Flight safety==\n{{main article|aviation safety}}\n'''Air safety''' is a term encompassing the theory, investigation and categorization of [[Aviation accidents and incidents|flight failures]], and the prevention of such failures through regulation, education and training.

Aerostats include [[balloon (aircraft)|free balloons]], [[airship]]s, and [[moored balloon]]s.

On high-speed cars, the lift force is directed downwards (called \"down-force\") to keep the car stable on the road.\n\nLift can also occur in a different way if the air is not still, especially if there is an updraft due to heat (\"thermals\") or wind blowing along sloping terrain or other meteorological conditions. This form of lift permits [[Lift (soaring)|soaring]] and is particularly important for gliding. It is used by birds and gliders to stay in the air for long periods with little effort.\n\n====Drag====\n{{main article|Drag (physics)}}\nFor a solid object moving through a fluid, the drag is the component of the [[Net force|net]] [[Aerodynamic force|aerodynamic]] or [[hydrodynamics|hydrodynamic]] [[force]] acting opposite to the direction of the movement.<ref>French 1970, p. 210.</ref><ref>[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/flight/physics.html \"Basic flight physics.\"] ''Berkeley University.''

Retrieved: May 6, 2012.</ref> Therefore, drag opposes the motion of the object, and in a powered vehicle it must be overcome by [[thrust]]. The process which creates lift also causes some drag.\n\n====Lift-to-drag ratio====\n[[File:Drag curves for aircraft in flight.svg|thumb|Speed and drag relationships for a typical aircraft]]\n{{main article|Lift-to-drag ratio}}\nAerodynamic lift is created by the motion of an aerodynamic object (wing) through the air, which due to its shape and angle deflects the air. For sustained straight and level flight, lift must be equal and opposite to weight. In general, long narrow wings are able deflect a large amount of air at a slow speed, whereas smaller wings need a higher forward speed to deflect an equivalent amount of air and thus generate an equivalent amount of lift. Large cargo aircraft tend to use longer wings with higher angles of attack, whereas supersonic aircraft tend to have short wings and rely heavily on high forward speed to generate lift.\n\nHowever, this lift (deflection) process inevitably causes a retarding force called drag. Because lift and drag are both aerodynamic forces, the ratio of lift to drag is an indication of the aerodynamic efficiency of the airplane. The lift to drag ratio is the L/D ratio, pronounced \"L over D ratio.\" An airplane has a high L/D ratio if it produces a large amount of lift or a small amount of drag. The lift/drag ratio is determined by dividing the lift coefficient by the drag coefficient, CL/CD. <ref>The Beginner's Guide to Aeronautics - NASA Glenn Research Center   https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/ldrat.html</ref>\n\nThe lift coefficient Cl is equal to the lift L divided by the (density r times half the velocity V squared times the wing area A). [Cl = L / (A * .5 * r * V^2)] The lift coefficient is also affected by the compressibility of the air, which is much greater at higher speeds, so velocity V is not a linear function. Compressibility is also affected by the shape of the aircraft surfaces.\n<ref>The Beginner's Guide to Aeronautics - NASA Glenn Research Center   https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/liftco.html </ref>\n\nThe drag coefficient Cd is equal to the drag D divided by the (density r times half the velocity V squared times the reference area A). [Cd = D / (A * .5 * r * V^2)] \n<ref>The Beginner's Guide to Aeronautics - NASA Glenn Research Center   https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/dragco.html</ref>\n\nLift-to-drag ratios for practical aircraft vary from about 4:1 for vehicles and birds with relatively short wings, up to 60:1 or more for vehicles with very long wings, such as gliders. A greater angle of attack relative to the forward movement also increases the extent of deflection, and thus generates extra lift. However a greater angle of attack also generates extra drag. \n\nLift/drag ratio also determines the glide ratio and gliding range. Since the glide ratio is based only on the relationship of the aerodynamics forces acting on the aircraft, aircraft weight will not affect it. The only effect weight has is to vary the time that the aircraft will glide for \u2013 a heavier aircraft gliding at a higher airspeed will arrive at the same touchdown point in a shorter time. <ref>The Beginner's Guide to Aeronautics - NASA Glenn Research Center   \nhttps://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/ldrat.html</ref>\n\n====Buoyancy====\n{{main article|Buoyancy}}\nAir pressure acting up against an object in air is greater than the pressure above pushing down. The buoyancy, in both cases, is equal to the weight of fluid displaced - [[Archimedes' principle]] holds for air just as it does for water.\n\nA cubic meter of air at ordinary [[atmospheric pressure]] and room temperature has a mass of about 1.2 kilograms, so its weight is about 12 [[Newton (unit)|newtons]]. Therefore, any 1-cubic-meter object in air is buoyed up with a force of 12 newtons. If the mass of the 1-cubic-meter object is greater than 1.2 kilograms (so that its weight is greater than 12 newtons), it falls to the ground when released. If an object of this size has a mass less than 1.2 kilograms, it rises in the air. Any object that has a mass that is less than the mass of an equal volume of air will rise in air - in other words, any object less dense than air will rise.\n\n====Thrust to weight ratio====\n{{main article|Thrust-to-weight ratio}}\n'''Thrust-to-weight ratio''' is, as its name suggests, the ratio of instantaneous [[thrust]] to [[weight]] (where weight means weight at the [[Earth]]'s standard acceleration <math>g_0</math>).<ref name=\"sutton\">Sutton and Biblarz 2000, p. 442. Quote: \"thrust-to-weight ratio F/W<sub>0</sub> is a dimensionless parameter that is identical to the acceleration of the rocket propulsion system (expressed in multiples of g0) if it could fly by itself in a gravity free vacuum.\"</ref> It is a dimensionless parameter characteristic of [[rocket]]s and other jet engines and of vehicles propelled by such engines (typically space [[launch vehicle]]s and jet [[aircraft]]).\n\nIf the [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] is greater than the local gravity strength (expressed in ''g''s), then flight can occur without any forward motion or any aerodynamic lift being required.\n\nIf the thrust-to-weight ratio times the lift-to-drag ratio is greater than local gravity then [[takeoff]] using aerodynamic lift is possible.\n\n===Flight dynamics===\n[[File:Aptch.gif|thumb|[[Aircraft principal axes|Pitch]]]]\n[[File:Ayaw.gif|thumb|[[Yaw (rotation)|Yaw]]]]\n[[File:Aileron roll.gif|thumb|[[Aerobatic maneuver|Roll]]]]\n[[File:dihedral.airliner.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|The upward tilt of the wings and tailplane of an aircraft, as seen on this [[Boeing 737]], is called dihedral angle]]{{main article|Flight dynamics}}\n'''Flight dynamics''' is the science of [[aircraft|air]] and [[spacecraft|space]] vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. The three critical flight dynamics parameters are the angles of rotation in three [[dimensions]] about the vehicle's [[center of mass]], known as ''pitch'', ''roll'' and ''yaw'' (See [[Tait-Bryan rotations]] for an explanation).\n\nThe control of these dimensions can involve a [[horizontal stabilizer]] (i.e. \"a tail\"), [[ailerons]] and other movable aerodynamic devices which control angular stability i.e. flight attitude (which in turn affects [[altitude]], [[Aircraft heading|heading]]). Wings are often angled slightly upwards- they have \"positive [[Dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral angle]]\" which gives inherent roll stabilization.\n\n===Energy efficiency===\n{{main article|propulsive efficiency}}\nTo create thrust so as to be able to gain height, and to push through the air to overcome the drag associated with lift all takes energy. Different objects and creatures capable of flight vary in the efficiency of their muscles, motors and how well this translates into forward thrust.\n\nPropulsive efficiency determines how much energy vehicles generate from a unit of fuel.<ref>[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-468/ch10-3.htm ch10-3 \"History.\"] ''NASA.''

Conventional aircraft accelerate along the ground until sufficient lift is generated for [[takeoff]], and reverse the process for [[landing]]. Some aircraft can take off at low speed; this is called a short takeoff. Some aircraft such as helicopters and Harrier jump jets can take off and land vertically. Rockets also usually take off and land vertically, but some designs can land horizontally.\n\n==Guidance, navigation and control==\n{{main article|Guidance, navigation and control}}\n\n===Navigation===\n[[Navigation]] is the systems necessary to calculate current position (e.g. [[compass]], [[GPS]], [[LORAN]], [[star tracker]], [[inertial measurement unit]], and [[altimeter]]).\n\nIn aircraft, successful [[air navigation]] involves piloting an aircraft from place to place without getting lost, breaking the laws applying to aircraft, or endangering the safety of those on board or on the [[Earth|ground]].\n\nThe techniques used for navigation in the air will depend on whether the aircraft is flying under the [[visual flight rules]] (VFR) or the [[instrument flight rules]] (IFR). In the latter case, the [[aviator|pilot]] will navigate exclusively using [[flight instruments|instruments]] and [[radio navigation aid]]s such as beacons, or as directed under [[radar]] control by [[air traffic control]]. In the VFR case, a pilot will largely navigate using [[dead reckoning]] combined with visual observations (known as [[pilotage]]), with reference to appropriate maps. This may be supplemented using radio navigation aids.\n\n===Guidance===\n{{main article|Guidance system}}\nA '''guidance system''' is a device or group of devices used in the [[navigation]] of a [[ship]], [[aircraft]], [[missile]], [[rocket]], [[satellite]], or other moving object. Typically, guidance is responsible for the calculation of the vector (i.e., direction, velocity) toward an objective.\n\n===Control===\n\n{{main article|Flight control system}}\nA conventional fixed-wing '''aircraft flight control system''' consists of [[flight control surfaces]], the respective cockpit controls, connecting linkages, and the necessary operating mechanisms to control an aircraft's direction in flight. [[Aircraft engine controls]] are also considered as flight controls as they change speed.\n\n====Traffic====\nIn the case of aircraft, air traffic is controlled by [[air traffic control]] systems.\n\n[[Collision avoidance (spacecraft)|Collision avoidance]] is the process of controlling spacecraft to try to prevent collisions.\n\n==Flight safety==\n{{main article|aviation safety}}\n'''Air safety''' is a term encompassing the theory, investigation and categorization of [[Aviation accidents and incidents|flight failures]], and the prevention of such failures through regulation, education and training. It can also be applied in the context of campaigns that inform the public as to the safety of [[air travel]].\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Flight}}\n* [[Aerodynamics]]\n* [[Levitation]]\n* [[Transvection (flying)]]\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n;Bibliography\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Coulson-Thomas, Colin.

He played [[college football]] at the [[Louisville Cardinals football|University of Louisville]], and was drafted in the first round of the [[2014 NFL Draft]] by the [[Minnesota Vikings]]. With the Vikings, Bridgewater threw for 14 touchdowns in each of his first two seasons, including winning the [[NFC North]] and making a [[2016 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]] appearance in 2015. The following preseason, Bridgewater suffered an injury to his left leg, which knocked him out for all but one offensive series the next two seasons.\n\nAfter the Vikings declined his fifth-year option, Bridgewater signed with the [[New York Jets]], although he was promptly traded to the [[New Orleans Saints]].
