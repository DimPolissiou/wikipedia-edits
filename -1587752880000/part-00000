{"title_page": "Christopher St Lawrence, 8th Baron Howth", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n'''Christopher St Lawrence, 8th Baron Howth''' (died 1589) was an Irish  politician and [[peerage|peer]]. He was a member of the [[Privy Council of Ireland]], and played a leading part in  the Government  of Ireland in the 1560s; but he  later went into opposition and was imprisoned as a result.  He was nicknamed the '''Blind Lord'''.\n\nHe was a man of considerable  intelligence and  learning,   who  may have  written part of  the historical compilation called ''The Book of Howth''.  On the other hand, he was notorious for his domestic cruelty: he was imprisoned  briefly and fined for ill-treating his wife and for  causing  the death of his teenage daughter through his  brutal  treatment of her.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nHe was born  sometime after 1509, the third of the four sons of  [[Christopher St Lawrence, 5th Baron Howth]] and  his wife Anne Bermingham. He was the  brother of Edward St Lawrence, 6th Baron Howth  and [[Richard St Lawrence, 7th Baron Howth]].<ref name=\"DNB\">{{cite DNB|wstitle=St. Lawrence, Christopher (d.1589)|last=Dunlop|first=Robert|volume=50}}</ref>  Since he was a younger son without much prospect of inheriting the title, not  a great deal  is recorded of his early years. He entered [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1544 and was practising at the [[English bar]] ten years later: his legal knowledge later made him an effective leader of the opposition to the Crown's policies. It is not known when he was afflicted with blindness, nor whether he went  totally blind.  By 1556 he had returned to Ireland and was managing one of the family estates.<ref>Ball F. Elrington  ''History of Dublin'' 6 Volumes Alexander Thom and Co Dublin 1902\u20131920</ref> He succeeded to the [[baron]]y in 1558 on the death of his brother Richard without issue.\n\n== Politician ==\n\n[[Image:Thomas Radclyffe Earl of Sussex.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex]], [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], and a key ally of Lord Howth]]\n\nThe [[Baron Howth|Baron of Howth]] was always well positioned  to play a major part in Irish politics: Christopher  had the additional advantage of enjoying the trust of the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], [[Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex|the Earl of Sussex]]. He was made a member of the Privy Council immediately after the accession of [[Elizabeth I]] and sat in her first [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] in 1560. Sussex sent him to negotiate with [[S\u00e9an \u00d3 N\u00e9ill|Shane O'Neill]], the effective ruler of [[Ulster]],   in 1561:   Howth  persuaded O'Neill  to go to London and submit himself  to the Queen's mercy.  Howth himself went to London the following year to discuss Irish affairs with the Queen. By his own  account Elizabeth  at first treated him with great suspicion,  simply because he was an Irishman,<ref>Ball  ''History of Dublin''</ref> but he succeeded in winning her trust. He was confirmed in the title  Baron of Howth and later [[knighted]]. After Sussex's recall from Ireland  he continued to enjoy the confidence of the [[Lord Justice of Ireland]], [[Sir Nicholas Arnold]], who sent him to negotiate  with the O'Reilly clan.\n\n== Opposition ==\n\nThe 1570s were a time of  conflict between Sussex's successor as  Lord Deputy, Sir [[Henry Sidney]], and the Anglo-Irish nobility over his taxation policies,  and especially over the ''cess'', the tax for maintaining garrisons. Howth, despite his previous record of loyalty to the Crown, emerged as  one of the leaders  of the opposition, and gave grave offence to the Queen as a result. Summoned before the Council, he argued that according to  his understanding  of the law  (and he was of course a qualified [[barrister]]) Sidney's proposals were [[unconstitutional]]. He was imprisoned for 5 months in [[Dublin Castle]], and then made a full submission to the Crown, arguing that he had never intended to question the [[Royal Prerogative]] or the Queen's power to tax her Irish subjects. After a sharp rebuke he was  allowed to go free,   but it is unlikely that he was ever fully trusted again, and it may be that his later prosecution for domestic cruelty had political motives behind it.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n== Charges of domestic cruelty ==\n\nIn 1579 Nicholas Terrell, a servant of Lord Howth, was convicted of [[perjury]]. In the course of the trial  there was a good deal of evidence  about Howth's cruelty to his wife, and the [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]], Sir [[William Gerard (Lord Chancellor of Ireland)|William Gerard]], ordered a further investigation into these allegations,  which resulted in a full hearing before the [[Court of Castle Chamber]], the Irish equivalent of [[Star Chamber]]. It is not  entirely clear why  Castle Chamber, which in theory  dealt  only with cases of  riot and  other offences against public order, intervened in a private  family law case (although in  practice Castle  Chamber did hear many  private lawsuits).\n\nThe evidence showed that Howth had assaulted his wife so often and  so severely that she had fled in fear of her life and taken refuge with  her brother. On  one occasion he had beaten her so badly that she had been unable to leave her bed for two weeks, and he had given her another  severe beating before she had  fully recovered from the first.<ref>''Dublin Penny Journal''  August 24, 1833</ref> Even more serious was the evidence that he had beaten his 13-year-old daughter Jane so badly  that she died as a result- \"some said he gave her  forty strokes, some said sixty, on her bare back\". Howth  in his defence  pleaded that Jane had died of a fever, unrelated to the beatings, which he admitted  to having administered.<ref name=\"Dublin Penny Journal 1833\">''Dublin Penny Journal'' 1833</ref>\n\nHowth was found guilty of both charges. He was  sentenced to a brief term of imprisonment and  fined heavily; he was ordered to pay maintenance to his wife, who was allowed to live apart from him and was  given [[child custody|custody]]  of the children. While the Government in imposing these penalties may have intended  to rebuke Howth for his opposition to its taxation policy, the verdict also suggests that the Court felt  genuine sympathy for Lady Howth.<ref>Crawford , Jon G. ''A Star Chamber Court in Ireland -the Court of Castle Chamber 1571\u20131641''  Four Courts Press Dublin 2006</ref>\n\n== Last years ==\n\nIn the 1580s Howth briefly resumed his role as leader of the opposition,  and succeeded in temporarily  blocking further proposals for tax reform by the Lord Deputy, [[Sir John Perrot]]. On this occasion he was quickly brought to admit his faults : he was reconciled with Perrot, and sent him a present of a [[Northern goshawk|goshawk]], a bird which has always been a great  rarity in Ireland.\n\nHe died on 24 October 1589 and was buried in Howth Abbey; his [[tomb]] has  an effigy to himself and his first wife. His last [[will (law)|will]] made generous [[bequests]] to servants but none of his children, except his eldest son, received anything. The reference in the will to his ''many and grave sins'' has led some to suggest that he felt  genuine remorse for his ill-treatment of his wife and daughter.<ref>Ball ''History of Dublin''</ref>\n\n== The Book of Howth ==\n\nHe owned a manuscript, the ''Book of Howth'', which is  a historical source of considerable  value. It is partly a celebration of the achievements of the St. Lawrence family and partly a description of historical events such as the [[Battle of Knockdoe]]. The last part deals in detail with Howth's own career and may well have been written by him.\n\n== Legend of Granuaile ==\n\nA famous legend, which may have some basis in fact, records that about 1575 [[Grace O'Malley]], or [[Granuaile]], the celebrated Pirate Queen of Galway, called at [[Howth Castle]] only to find the gates barred. Outraged by the discourtesy, she kidnapped Lord Howth's heir, then a young child (this would probably have been the 8th Baron's grandson, [[Christopher St Lawrence, 10th Baron Howth]]) and held him [[hostage]]  until the St. Lawrence family apologised for their lack of hospitality.  To make amends Lord Howth promised that in future his gates would always be open at dinner time and a place  would be set at table  for unexpected guests, a tradition which later generations maintained.\n\n[[Image:Howth Castle.jpg|thumb|Howth Castle]]\n\n== Character ==\n\nElrington Ball<ref>''History of Dublin''</ref> calls  the eighth Lord Howth the most striking member of his family and the most forceful Irish statesman of the Elizabethan era. He does not defend his ill- treatment of his wife and daughter, but argues,  rather unconvincingly, that the early years of his marriage were  probably happy enough.  Crawford<ref>''A Star Chamber Court in  Ireland''</ref> takes a much more severe view of Howth's  faults, arguing that  his killing of his daughter Jane  was certainly at least [[manslaughter]], and possibly  [[murder]], and  notes that her mother  was forced to flee from home in order to avoid a similar fate.\n\n== Family ==\n[[Image:Beaulieu House, Co. Louth, Republic of Ireland.jpg|thumb|Beaulieu House, the home of Howth's first wife Elizabeth Plunket]]\n\nHe married firstly  about 1540, Elizabeth Plunket, daughter of Sir John Plunket of [[Beaulieu House and Gardens, Co. Louth|Beaulieu House, County Louth]] and his wife Anne Barnewall of Dromnagh, [[County Tipperary]]. From her testimony at her husband's  trial,   we know that they had 14 children, but presumably several of them died in infancy  and only 8  children can be  identified with certainty:\n\n* [[Nicholas St Lawrence, 9th Baron Howth]] (c.1550\u20131607)\n* Thomas (died 1600), who was killed at the [[Battle of Moyry Pass]]\n* Leonard (died 1608), who married Anne Eustace\n* Richard, who married a daughter of Francis Corby\n* Margaret, who married firstly William Fitzwilliam and secondly Michael Berford\n* Mary, who married Sir [[Patrick Barnewall (died 1622)|Patrick Barnewall]] of Turvey (the marriage was  annulled in 1579; she evidently did not remarry)\n* Elizabeth\n* Jane,  who died  in 1577,  aged only 13, a  victim of her father's ill-treatment.<ref name=\"Dublin Penny Journal 1833\"/>\n\nHe married secondly, after 1579, Cecily Cusack, daughter of Henry Cusack, [[alderman]] of Dublin.

It was founded in 1907, when [[Transylvania]] was part of [[Austria-Hungary]], and the current name \"CFR\" is the [[acronym]] for ''[[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne]]'' (\"Romanian Railways\").<ref>{{cite web|last=Hafez |first=Shamoon |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19588706 |title=BBC Sport&nbsp;\u2013 Champions League: What can Manchester United expect in Cluj? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nBefore receiving significant financial support from previous owner \u00c1rp\u00e1d P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny in 2002, the club had spent most of its existence in the lower divisions. Since returning to the top flight in 2004, CFR Cluj has relied increasingly on [[List of foreign Liga I players|foreign players]] for its success. In the [[2005\u201306 Divizia A|2005\u201306 season]], they participated in their first [[UEFA|European competition]], the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup|Intertoto Cup]], finishing as runners-up. In the [[2007\u201308 Liga I|2007\u201308 campaign]], they were champions of [[Liga I]] for the first time in their history, taking the national title away from [[Bucharest|capital]]-based teams after seventeen years and consequently qualifying for the [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage in the process. Only six years earlier, CFR was playing in the [[Liga III|third tier]] of the [[Romanian football league system]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7640867.stm | work=BBC News | title=Scolari forewarned | date=28 September 2008 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> Between [[2017\u201318 Liga I|2018]] and [[2018\u201319 Liga I|2019]], \"the White and Burgundies\" won back-to-back championships for the first time. CFR has won a total of twelve domestic trophies, all in the [[21st century]]\u2014five Liga I, four [[Cupa Rom\u00e2niei]], and three [[Supercupa Rom\u00e2niei]].\n\nCFR has a fierce rivalry with neighbouring [[FC Universitatea Cluj|Universitatea Cluj]], with matches between the two being known as the ''[[Cluj derby|Derbiul Clujului]]''.\n\n==History==\n\n===Establishment and early years (1907\u20131969)===\n[[File:Kolozsv\u00e1ri Vasutas Sport Club 1911.jpg|260px|thumb|''Kolozsv\u00e1ri Vasutas Sport Club'' team in 1911.]]\nCFR was founded in 1907, when the city of [[Cluj-Napoca]] (then Kolozsv\u00e1r) was part of [[Austria-Hungary]], under the name ''Kolozsv\u00e1ri Vasutas Sport Club'' (\"Kolozsv\u00e1r Railway Sports Club\"). From 1907 to 1910, the team played in the municipal championship. However, the club did not have any notable achievements during this time. In 1911, the team won the newly organized Championship of Transylvania. The club consistently finished in second place in that competition between 1911 and 1914, a competition that was interrupted because of [[World War I]]. After the war, in 1920, Transylvania became part of Romania and the club accordingly changed its name to '''CFR Cluj''', maintaining its links with the national rail organisation, this time the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] state railway carrier, [[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne]], hence the acronym. They went on to win two regional titles, in 1918\u201319 and 1919\u201320.\n\nBetween 1920 and 1934 the club did not have any notable achievements. Between 1934 and 1936, CFR played for two seasons in the [[Divizia B]], ranking sixth in the [[1934\u201335 Divizia B|1934\u201335 season]] and eighth in the [[1935\u201336 Divizia B|1935\u201336 season]]. In 1936, CFR was relegated to the [[Divizia C]], where the team played for two seasons, finishing [[1936\u201337 Divizia C|second]] and 4th, respectively. After [[World War II]], CFR played for one season in the Divizia C, earning the promotion to the Divizia B. Before the start of the [[1947\u201348 Divizia B|1947\u201348 season]], the team merged with another local club, [[Ferar Cluj]], and played in the [[Divizia A]] for the [[1947\u201348 Divizia A|very first time]] in history. Unfortunately, the team [[1948\u201349 Divizia A|lasted only two years in the first league]] and would not play there again for another 20 years. In 1960, another merger, this time with [[Dermata Cluj|Rapid Cluj]] resulted in ''CSM Cluj''. In 1964, the team's name was changed to ''Clujeana''. In that same year, the club's junior team won the national championship. Three years later, the team's name was reversed yet again to '''CFR Cluj'''.\n\n===Return to the top flight (1969\u20131976)===\n[[File:CFR Cluj League Performance.svg|thumb|right|290px|Chart of yearly table positions of CFR in the national leagues.]]\nIn [[1968\u201369 Divizia B|1969]], CFR finished first in Divizia B with 40 points, five more than their rival, [[FC Politehnica Timi\u0219oara|Politehnica Timi\u0219oara]]. The conclusive game of that season was a 1\u20131 draw with Politehnica. Politehnica had a 1\u20130 lead at half-time, but CFR came back with a fine header.\n\nDuring the summer of 1969, CFR Cluj advanced to Divizia A under the leadership of coach [[Constantin R\u0103dulescu (footballer, born 1924)|Constantin R\u0103dulescu]]. R\u0103dulescu was originally from southern Romania, but he grew to manhood in the stern atmosphere of [[Transylvania]]. Before coaching, he had played for CFR and another well-known local team, [[CFM Universitatea Cluj|Universitatea Cluj]], during the 1940s. In the [[1969\u201370 Divizia A|1969\u201370 first league championship]], CFR made its debut with a 2\u20130 victory over [[ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 (1962)|ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]]. The next few games did not go as well. Apart from a 1\u20130 win over [[FC Politehnica Ia\u0219i (1945)|Politehnica Ia\u0219i]], there were losses to [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]] (1\u20133) and [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]] (0\u20132). These and other defeats were a factor in the team's downhill slide. However, the following spring CFR bounced back with a win over ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 (1\u20130), after a goal from [[Octavian Ionescu (footballer, born 1949)|Octavian Ionescu]], and averted relegation.\n\nAt the beginning of CFR's [[1970\u201371 Divizia A|second season in Divizia A]], R\u0103dulescu was replaced by [[Eugen Iordache]] as head coach. During his tenure, CFR did not do well, and R\u0103dulescu was swiftly brought back. Even so, CFR Cluj found itself again at the bottom of the table before the winter break. The spring of 1971 was somewhat better, although CFR struggled again to avoid relegation. CFR's last game of that season, against [[FCM UTA Arad|UTA Arad]], was a memorable one. CFR led 1\u20130 at half-time. UTA Arad, however, overturned the match after scoring twice. Nonetheless, the persistence of the players from Cluj was rewarded with a late goal, tying the game at 2\u20132. UTA went on to [[1970\u201371 European Cup|play in the European Cups]], but, most importantly, CFR avoided relegation.\n\nThe [[1971\u201372 Divizia A|1971\u201372 season]] started off badly for CFR. Losses to Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti (1\u20133); [[FC Bihor Oradea|Cri\u0219ul Oradea]] (0\u20131, after a last-minute penalty kick), and [[CS Jiul Petro\u0219ani|Jiul Petro\u0219ani]] (1\u20132 after two regrettable own-goals) meant CFR's demise after the first round of the championship&nbsp;\u2013 the team finished at the bottom, with seven points. CFR's return was dramatic, although inconsistent at times. The team won some important games, such as a 1\u20130 with [[CS Universitatea Craiova|Universitatea Craiova]] and a 3\u20130 with [[FC Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti|Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti]]. By the end of the season, however, CFR was again struggling to stay in Divizia A. CFR was tied at half-time after having led with 2\u20130 in their game against [[FC Politehnica Ia\u0219i (1945)|Politehnica Ia\u0219i]]. In the second half, two late goals from Ionescu and Petrescu saved the team from relegation. When R\u0103dulescu and his players got back home to Cluj, 3,000 fans turned out to celebrate their performance.\n\nDuring the summer of 1972, CFR made an important transfer. [[Mihai Adam]], from Universitatea Cluj, was traded for Soos. Adam had been twice Romania's top scorer, and was considered one of the best Romanian players of his generation. He and the rest of the team would make the [[1972\u201373 Divizia A|1972\u201373 season]] the most successful in CFR's history. The team achieved its highest ranking ever in Romanian football, fifth in Divizia A. Several important results concluded a great season, including a 2\u20130 victory against [[FC Rapid Bucure\u0219ti|Rapid Bucure\u0219ti]], a 2\u20132 draw against [[FC Sportul Studen\u021besc Bucure\u0219ti|Sportul Studen\u021besc Bucure\u0219ti]], and another draw, 1\u20131, with Steaua Bucure\u0219ti. Additionally, the stadium that CFR continues to use even today was built in 1973. To celebrate the completion of the stadium, CFR Cluj played a friendly game against [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]]. The game ended in a 2\u20131 victory for CFR.\n\nThe [[1973\u201374 Divizia A|1973\u201374 season]] was a rather bad one for CFR, as it barely saved itself from relegation, ranking 14th at the end of the season. The only notable achievement of that season was Mihai Adam's third title as Romania's top goal-scorer who, even though he was 33 years old, scored 23 goals. The [[1974\u201375 Divizia A|1974\u201375 season]] was much like the one before: CFR struggled to avoid relegation, achieving its objectives all the while. The [[1975\u201376 Divizia A|1975\u201376 season]] marked CFR's relegation and its last season in Divizia A during the 20th century. A contributing factor was the age of the team, with most of its players in their 30s.\n\n===Lower leagues (1976\u20132002)===\nDuring the [[1977\u201378 Divizia B|1977\u201378 season]], CFR attempted to make a comeback. However, the team finished only second in [[Divizia B]], after [[FC Baia Mare|Baia Mare]]. Four years later, [[1981\u201382 Divizia B|CFR slid further down]], into the third division, [[Divizia C]]. From then on, the team would alternate between the second and third leagues. In 1983, CFR played in Divizia B under its longstanding coach, Dr. Constantin R\u0103dulescu. In the 1990s, CFR struggled financially and found itself more than once on the brink of bankruptcy. Nevertheless, several very talented players were raised, including [[Cristian Dulca]], Attila Piro\u0219ka, [[Cristian Coroian]], and [[Alin Minteuan]].\n\n===P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny takeover, ascent and first European participation (2002\u20132007)===\nIn January 2002, a new sponsor, \u00c1rp\u00e1d P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny, head of S.C. ECOMAX M.G., founded a new commercial sport society, with ECOMAX M.G. as the primary shareholder. By the end of the [[2001\u201302 Divizia C|2001\u201302 season]], CFR had been promoted back to Divizia B.\n\nThe [[2002\u201303 Divizia B|summer of 2003]] was very important for CFR as many new talented players were transferred including C\u0103t\u0103lin Bozdog, [[Adrian Anca]], Cristian Turcu, and Sabin P\u00eegli\u0219an. With these players and others, CFR entered the first league after [[2003\u201304 Divizia B|a successful season in Divizia B]]. CFR began the season strongly, holding first place for a while. Then the club's main sponsor, \u00c1rp\u00e1d P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny, became involved in a public scandal during which P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny accused several referees of corruption. The affair plagued the team and resulted in the dismissal of head coach GH. Cioceri. CFR lost several consecutive games before the scandal subsided. After the winter break, Cioceri was replaced by [[Aurel Sunda]]. In the spring of 2004, Sunda's team had a nearly perfect run, winning 14 out of 15 games, with only one draw. One round before the season's end, CFR was in second place, one point behind the [[CS Jiul Petro\u0219ani|Jiul Petro\u0219ani]] in first. But when Jiul was held to a draw by [[CS Gaz Metan Media\u0219|Gaz Metan Media\u0219]], and CFR won their last match 3\u20130, CFR advanced to the top of the league for the first time in 28 years. In the summer of 2004, CFR acquired many new players, including [[Vasile Jula]] and [[Radu Marginean]].\n\nCFR Cluj's [[2004\u201305 Divizia A|first year back in Divizia A]] was strong, yet inconsistent. CFR finished sixth after the first half of the 2004\u201305 championship. It was during this time that CFR played one of its most popular games ever, defeating, [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]] at home. The final score was 4\u20132, after two goals each by Adrian Anca and Sorin Oncic\u0103. However, the second half of the championship proved disappointing for CFR, as it gathered only 12 points after 15 games. The team finished 11th, avoiding relegation.\n\nThe summer of 2005 brought significant change to CFR Cluj. The club's executives signed the team up for the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]], being CFR's first European adventure. CFR began well, qualifying for the second round after two victories against [[FK Vetra]] (3\u20132 and 4\u20131).\n\nAlso, the Romanian international [[Dorinel Munteanu]] came to CFR from [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]]. Munteanu would have the dual role of player-coach. His first game produced one of CFR's greatest successes. CFR defeated [[Athletic Bilbao]] of Spain 1\u20130 (although almost all players from Bilbao's side were from the reserve squad) during the second round of the [[2005 UEFA Intertoto Cup]]. The only goal of the match was scored by [[Cosmin Tilinc\u0103]] with a header. CFR then lost in [[Bilbao]] (1\u20130) but still qualified to the next round after a penalty shootout.\n\nMunteanu's team played the next game at Cluj, against French club [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne|Saint-\u00c9tienne]]. Adrian Anca played one of the greatest games in his career, even though the match ended in a 1\u20131 draw. Anca hit the crossbar with a header early in the game, and Tilinc\u0103 pushed the ball into the net from the rebound. Anca then went on to earn a penalty, but did not score. He then hit the crossbar a second time in the second half. The away game, in [[France]], was also an eventful game for CFR Cluj. The game began well for CFR, as [[Cristian Coroian]] scored from a penalty kick, earned by Adrian Anca. The second half went less smoothly for CFR; [[Julien Sabl\u00e9]] scored for Saint-\u00c9tienne, tying the game at 1\u20131. This was followed by CFR player [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Balint]]'s elimination. However, a [[Cosmin Tilinc\u0103]] goal gave the team the ability to tie with the French at the very last minute. The game ended in a 2\u20132 draw, so CFR went on to the next qualifying stage due to its away goals. In the next round CFR easily disposed of [[Zalgiris Vilnius]], 2\u20131 in [[Lithuania]] and 5\u20131 at home.\n\nFor the final match of the 2005 UEFA Interoto Cup, CFR Cluj's opponent was another French franchise, [[RC Lens]]. The first game, at Cluj, ended in a 1\u20131 draw with both sides having scored from free kicks. Cristian Turcu scored for CFR. The second game was played at [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]] in front of 30,000 French fans. The Romanian players showed signs of exhaustion and conceded three goals. Player-coach Dorinel Munteanu scored a goal from a free kick in the 89th minute. Thus ended CFR Cluj's Intertoto journey. CFR then finished fifth at the end of the [[2005\u201306 Divizia A|2005\u201306 domestic season]]. During the [[2006\u201307 Liga I|2006\u201307 season]], major changes at the club started to occur. Dorinel Munteanu resigned as player-coach, and was replaced by [[Cristiano Bergodi]]. Foreign players from Western Europe and South America were transferred. A partnership with Portuguese club [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] was signed. On 22 July 2007, CFR Cluj celebrated its centenary year by playing a friendly game against Benfica and inaugurating the new illumination system at its stadium.\n\n===Strong domestic success (2007\u20132012)===\n[[File:Chelsea (2) v (1) CFR Cluj.jpg|thumb|260px|CFR Cluj's players at the [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] in December 2008.]]\n\nThe team's new coach, Romanian [[Ioan Andone]], formerly of [[AC Omonia|Omonia Nicosia]] and [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]] started the [[2007\u201308 Liga I|2007\u201308 season]] well, with CFR Cluj leading the league by eight points halfway through the season and remaining undefeated.

({{IPA-ro|t\u0361\u0283efe\u02ccre \u02c8klu\u0292}} or {{IPA-ro|\u02cct\u0361\u0283efere \u02c8klu\u0292|}}), is a Romanian professional [[association football|football]] [[football team|club]] based in the city of [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Cluj County]]. It was founded in 1907, when [[Transylvania]] was part of [[Austria-Hungary]], and the current name \"CFR\" is the [[acronym]] for ''[[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne]]'' (\"Romanian Railways\").<ref>{{cite web|last=Hafez |first=Shamoon |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19588706 |title=BBC Sport&nbsp;\u2013 Champions League: What can Manchester United expect in Cluj? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nBefore receiving significant financial support from previous owner \u00c1rp\u00e1d P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny in 2002, the club had spent most of its existence in the lower divisions. Since returning to the top flight in 2004, CFR Cluj has relied increasingly on [[List of foreign Liga I players|foreign players]] for its success. In the [[2005\u201306 Divizia A|2005\u201306 season]], they participated in their first [[UEFA|European competition]], the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup|Intertoto Cup]], finishing as runners-up. In the [[2007\u201308 Liga I|2007\u201308 campaign]], they were champions of [[Liga I]] for the first time in their history, taking the national title away from [[Bucharest|capital]]-based teams after seventeen years and consequently qualifying for the [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage in the process. Only six years earlier, CFR was playing in the [[Liga III|third tier]] of the [[Romanian football league system]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7640867.stm | work=BBC News | title=Scolari forewarned | date=28 September 2008 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> Between [[2017\u201318 Liga I|2018]] and [[2018\u201319 Liga I|2019]], \"the White and Burgundies\" won back-to-back championships for the first time. CFR has won a total of twelve domestic trophies, all in the [[21st century]]\u2014five Liga I, four [[Cupa Rom\u00e2niei]], and three [[Supercupa Rom\u00e2niei]].\n\nCFR has a fierce rivalry with neighbouring [[FC Universitatea Cluj|Universitatea Cluj]], with matches between the two being known as the ''[[Cluj derby|Derbiul Clujului]]''.\n\n==History==\n\n===Establishment and early years (1907\u20131969)===\n[[File:Kolozsv\u00e1ri Vasutas Sport Club 1911.jpg|260px|thumb|''Kolozsv\u00e1ri Vasutas Sport Club'' team in 1911.]]\nCFR was founded in 1907, when the city of [[Cluj-Napoca]] (then Kolozsv\u00e1r) was part of [[Austria-Hungary]], under the name ''Kolozsv\u00e1ri Vasutas Sport Club'' (\"Kolozsv\u00e1r Railway Sports Club\"). From 1907 to 1910, the team played in the municipal championship. However, the club did not have any notable achievements during this time. In 1911, the team won the newly organized Championship of Transylvania. The club consistently finished in second place in that competition between 1911 and 1914, a competition that was interrupted because of [[World War I]]. After the war, in 1920, Transylvania became part of Romania and the club accordingly changed its name to '''CFR Cluj''', maintaining its links with the national rail organisation, this time the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] state railway carrier, [[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne]], hence the acronym. They went on to win two regional titles, in 1918\u201319 and 1919\u201320.\n\nBetween 1920 and 1934 the club did not have any notable achievements. Between 1934 and 1936, CFR played for two seasons in the [[Divizia B]], ranking sixth in the [[1934\u201335 Divizia B|1934\u201335 season]] and eighth in the [[1935\u201336 Divizia B|1935\u201336 season]]. In 1936, CFR was relegated to the [[Divizia C]], where the team played for two seasons, finishing [[1936\u201337 Divizia C|second]] and 4th, respectively. After [[World War II]], CFR played for one season in the Divizia C, earning the promotion to the Divizia B. Before the start of the [[1947\u201348 Divizia B|1947\u201348 season]], the team merged with another local club, [[Ferar Cluj]], and played in the [[Divizia A]] for the [[1947\u201348 Divizia A|very first time]] in history. Unfortunately, the team [[1948\u201349 Divizia A|lasted only two years in the first league]] and would not play there again for another 20 years. In 1960, another merger, this time with [[Dermata Cluj|Rapid Cluj]] resulted in ''CSM Cluj''. In 1964, the team's name was changed to ''Clujeana''. In that same year, the club's junior team won the national championship. Three years later, the team's name was reversed yet again to '''CFR Cluj'''.\n\n===Return to the top flight (1969\u20131976)===\n[[File:CFR Cluj League Performance.svg|thumb|right|290px|Chart of yearly table positions of CFR in the national leagues.]]\nIn [[1968\u201369 Divizia B|1969]], CFR finished first in Divizia B with 40 points, five more than their rival, [[FC Politehnica Timi\u0219oara|Politehnica Timi\u0219oara]]. The conclusive game of that season was a 1\u20131 draw with Politehnica. Politehnica had a 1\u20130 lead at half-time, but CFR came back with a fine header.\n\nDuring the summer of 1969, CFR Cluj advanced to Divizia A under the leadership of coach [[Constantin R\u0103dulescu (footballer, born 1924)|Constantin R\u0103dulescu]]. R\u0103dulescu was originally from southern Romania, but he grew to manhood in the stern atmosphere of [[Transylvania]]. Before coaching, he had played for CFR and another well-known local team, [[CFM Universitatea Cluj|Universitatea Cluj]], during the 1940s. In the [[1969\u201370 Divizia A|1969\u201370 first league championship]], CFR made its debut with a 2\u20130 victory over [[ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 (1962)|ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]]. The next few games did not go as well. Apart from a 1\u20130 win over [[FC Politehnica Ia\u0219i (1945)|Politehnica Ia\u0219i]], there were losses to [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]] (1\u20133) and [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]] (0\u20132). These and other defeats were a factor in the team's downhill slide. However, the following spring CFR bounced back with a win over ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 (1\u20130), after a goal from [[Octavian Ionescu (footballer, born 1949)|Octavian Ionescu]], and averted relegation.\n\nAt the beginning of CFR's [[1970\u201371 Divizia A|second season in Divizia A]], R\u0103dulescu was replaced by [[Eugen Iordache]] as head coach. During his tenure, CFR did not do well, and R\u0103dulescu was swiftly brought back. Even so, CFR Cluj found itself again at the bottom of the table before the winter break. The spring of 1971 was somewhat better, although CFR struggled again to avoid relegation. CFR's last game of that season, against [[FCM UTA Arad|UTA Arad]], was a memorable one. CFR led 1\u20130 at half-time. UTA Arad, however, overturned the match after scoring twice. Nonetheless, the persistence of the players from Cluj was rewarded with a late goal, tying the game at 2\u20132. UTA went on to [[1970\u201371 European Cup|play in the European Cups]], but, most importantly, CFR avoided relegation.\n\nThe [[1971\u201372 Divizia A|1971\u201372 season]] started off badly for CFR. Losses to Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti (1\u20133); [[FC Bihor Oradea|Cri\u0219ul Oradea]] (0\u20131, after a last-minute penalty kick), and [[CS Jiul Petro\u0219ani|Jiul Petro\u0219ani]] (1\u20132 after two regrettable own-goals) meant CFR's demise after the first round of the championship&nbsp;\u2013 the team finished at the bottom, with seven points. CFR's return was dramatic, although inconsistent at times. The team won some important games, such as a 1\u20130 with [[CS Universitatea Craiova|Universitatea Craiova]] and a 3\u20130 with [[FC Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti|Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti]]. By the end of the season, however, CFR was again struggling to stay in Divizia A. CFR was tied at half-time after having led with 2\u20130 in their game against [[FC Politehnica Ia\u0219i (1945)|Politehnica Ia\u0219i]]. In the second half, two late goals from Ionescu and Petrescu saved the team from relegation. When R\u0103dulescu and his players got back home to Cluj, 3,000 fans turned out to celebrate their performance.\n\nDuring the summer of 1972, CFR made an important transfer. [[Mihai Adam]], from Universitatea Cluj, was traded for Soos. Adam had been twice Romania's top scorer, and was considered one of the best Romanian players of his generation. He and the rest of the team would make the [[1972\u201373 Divizia A|1972\u201373 season]] the most successful in CFR's history. The team achieved its highest ranking ever in Romanian football, fifth in Divizia A. Several important results concluded a great season, including a 2\u20130 victory against [[FC Rapid Bucure\u0219ti|Rapid Bucure\u0219ti]], a 2\u20132 draw against [[FC Sportul Studen\u021besc Bucure\u0219ti|Sportul Studen\u021besc Bucure\u0219ti]], and another draw, 1\u20131, with Steaua Bucure\u0219ti. Additionally, the stadium that CFR continues to use even today was built in 1973. To celebrate the completion of the stadium, CFR Cluj played a friendly game against [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]]. The game ended in a 2\u20131 victory for CFR.\n\nThe [[1973\u201374 Divizia A|1973\u201374 season]] was a rather bad one for CFR, as it barely saved itself from relegation, ranking 14th at the end of the season. The only notable achievement of that season was Mihai Adam's third title as Romania's top goal-scorer who, even though he was 33 years old, scored 23 goals. The [[1974\u201375 Divizia A|1974\u201375 season]] was much like the one before: CFR struggled to avoid relegation, achieving its objectives all the while. The [[1975\u201376 Divizia A|1975\u201376 season]] marked CFR's relegation and its last season in Divizia A during the 20th century. A contributing factor was the age of the team, with most of its players in their 30s.\n\n===Lower leagues (1976\u20132002)===\nDuring the [[1977\u201378 Divizia B|1977\u201378 season]], CFR attempted to make a comeback. However, the team finished only second in [[Divizia B]], after [[FC Baia Mare|Baia Mare]]. Four years later, [[1981\u201382 Divizia B|CFR slid further down]], into the third division, [[Divizia C]]. From then on, the team would alternate between the second and third leagues. In 1983, CFR played in Divizia B under its longstanding coach, Dr. Constantin R\u0103dulescu. In the 1990s, CFR struggled financially and found itself more than once on the brink of bankruptcy. Nevertheless, several very talented players were raised, including [[Cristian Dulca]], Attila Piro\u0219ka, [[Cristian Coroian]], and [[Alin Minteuan]].\n\n===P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny takeover, ascent and first European participation (2002\u20132007)===\nIn January 2002, a new sponsor, \u00c1rp\u00e1d P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny, head of S.C. ECOMAX M.G., founded a new commercial sport society, with ECOMAX M.G. as the primary shareholder. By the end of the [[2001\u201302 Divizia C|2001\u201302 season]], CFR had been promoted back to Divizia B.\n\nThe [[2002\u201303 Divizia B|summer of 2003]] was very important for CFR as many new talented players were transferred including C\u0103t\u0103lin Bozdog, [[Adrian Anca]], Cristian Turcu, and Sabin P\u00eegli\u0219an. With these players and others, CFR entered the first league after [[2003\u201304 Divizia B|a successful season in Divizia B]]. CFR began the season strongly, holding first place for a while. Then the club's main sponsor, \u00c1rp\u00e1d P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny, became involved in a public scandal during which P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny accused several referees of corruption. The affair plagued the team and resulted in the dismissal of head coach GH. Cioceri. CFR lost several consecutive games before the scandal subsided. After the winter break, Cioceri was replaced by [[Aurel Sunda]]. In the spring of 2004, Sunda's team had a nearly perfect run, winning 14 out of 15 games, with only one draw. One round before the season's end, CFR was in second place, one point behind the [[CS Jiul Petro\u0219ani|Jiul Petro\u0219ani]] in first. But when Jiul was held to a draw by [[CS Gaz Metan Media\u0219|Gaz Metan Media\u0219]], and CFR won their last match 3\u20130, CFR advanced to the top of the league for the first time in 28 years. In the summer of 2004, CFR acquired many new players, including [[Vasile Jula]] and [[Radu Marginean]].\n\nCFR Cluj's [[2004\u201305 Divizia A|first year back in Divizia A]] was strong, yet inconsistent. CFR finished sixth after the first half of the 2004\u201305 championship. It was during this time that CFR played one of its most popular games ever, defeating, [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]] at home. The final score was 4\u20132, after two goals each by Adrian Anca and Sorin Oncic\u0103. However, the second half of the championship proved disappointing for CFR, as it gathered only 12 points after 15 games. The team finished 11th, avoiding relegation.\n\nThe summer of 2005 brought significant change to CFR Cluj. The club's executives signed the team up for the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]], being CFR's first European adventure. CFR began well, qualifying for the second round after two victories against [[FK Vetra]] (3\u20132 and 4\u20131).\n\nAlso, the Romanian international [[Dorinel Munteanu]] came to CFR from [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]]. Munteanu would have the dual role of player-coach. His first game produced one of CFR's greatest successes. CFR defeated [[Athletic Bilbao]] of Spain 1\u20130 (although almost all players from Bilbao's side were from the reserve squad) during the second round of the [[2005 UEFA Intertoto Cup]]. The only goal of the match was scored by [[Cosmin Tilinc\u0103]] with a header. CFR then lost in [[Bilbao]] (1\u20130) but still qualified to the next round after a penalty shootout.\n\nMunteanu's team played the next game at Cluj, against French club [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne|Saint-\u00c9tienne]]. Adrian Anca played one of the greatest games in his career, even though the match ended in a 1\u20131 draw. Anca hit the crossbar with a header early in the game, and Tilinc\u0103 pushed the ball into the net from the rebound. Anca then went on to earn a penalty, but did not score. He then hit the crossbar a second time in the second half. The away game, in [[France]], was also an eventful game for CFR Cluj. The game began well for CFR, as [[Cristian Coroian]] scored from a penalty kick, earned by Adrian Anca. The second half went less smoothly for CFR; [[Julien Sabl\u00e9]] scored for Saint-\u00c9tienne, tying the game at 1\u20131. This was followed by CFR player [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Balint]]'s elimination. However, a [[Cosmin Tilinc\u0103]] goal gave the team the ability to tie with the French at the very last minute. The game ended in a 2\u20132 draw, so CFR went on to the next qualifying stage due to its away goals. In the next round CFR easily disposed of [[Zalgiris Vilnius]], 2\u20131 in [[Lithuania]] and 5\u20131 at home.\n\nFor the final match of the 2005 UEFA Interoto Cup, CFR Cluj's opponent was another French franchise, [[RC Lens]]. The first game, at Cluj, ended in a 1\u20131 draw with both sides having scored from free kicks. Cristian Turcu scored for CFR. The second game was played at [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]] in front of 30,000 French fans. The Romanian players showed signs of exhaustion and conceded three goals. Player-coach Dorinel Munteanu scored a goal from a free kick in the 89th minute. Thus ended CFR Cluj's Intertoto journey. CFR then finished fifth at the end of the [[2005\u201306 Divizia A|2005\u201306 domestic season]]. During the [[2006\u201307 Liga I|2006\u201307 season]], major changes at the club started to occur. Dorinel Munteanu resigned as player-coach, and was replaced by [[Cristiano Bergodi]]. Foreign players from Western Europe and South America were transferred. A partnership with Portuguese club [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] was signed. On 22 July 2007, CFR Cluj celebrated its centenary year by playing a friendly game against Benfica and inaugurating the new illumination system at its stadium.\n\n===Strong domestic success (2007\u20132012)===\n[[File:Chelsea (2) v (1) CFR Cluj.jpg|thumb|260px|CFR Cluj's players at the [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] in December 2008.]]\n\nThe team's new coach, Romanian [[Ioan Andone]], formerly of [[AC Omonia|Omonia Nicosia]] and [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]] started the [[2007\u201308 Liga I|2007\u201308 season]] well, with CFR Cluj leading the league by eight points halfway through the season and remaining undefeated.

Caught between them is real-life British engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], builder of the century's greatest ship, {{SS|Great Eastern}}. Brunel is kidnapped by Nemo to help design a submarine with which to fight the laying of the [[transatlantic telegraph cable]], which links the two colonialist forces Nemo hates, England and the US. Brunel finds himself going up against his own ship, and the strange man hired to protect it, Captain Ahab.\n\nIn March 2019, the film rights to ''The Great Eastern'' were acquired by the UK film company Great Point Media, and Rodman was commissioned to write the screen adaptation.<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Howard A.

On their second [[play from scrimmage]], [[running back]] [[Bill Osmanski]] ran 68 yards for a touchdown.

The field goal attempt on 4th down was missed as well.\n\nLater in the first quarter, Bears [[quarterback]] [[Sid Luckman]] scored on a 1-yard touchdown run to increase the lead 14\u20130. On their third drive, [[Joe Maniaci]] ran 42 yards for the Bears' third touchdown of the game.\n\nThe Bears held a 28\u20130 halftime lead and then continued to crush the Redskins, scoring 45 points during the second half. After Halas took the team's starters out, the backup players continued to pile on the points. The Bears ended up recording 501 total yards on offense, 382 total rushing yards, and 8 interceptions\u2014returning 3 for touchdowns, all in the third quarter.\n\nSo many footballs were kicked into the stands after touchdowns that officials asked Halas to run or pass for the [[point after touchdown]] on the last two touchdowns.<ref name=baugh>{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PLAYER_ID=21 |title=Hall of Famers \u00bb SAMMY BAUGH |publisher=Profootballhof.com |date= |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThis game also marked the last time that an NFL player (Bears end [[Dick Plasman]]) played without a helmet.<ref name=\"noverr\"/>\n\nReportedly, after the final gun went off, a sports writer jokingly yelled, \"Marshall just shot himself!\" Marshall's only statement to the press was, \"We needed a 50 man line against their power.\"\n\nRedskins quarterback [[Sammy Baugh]] was interviewed after the game, and a sportswriter asked him whether the game would have been different had Malone not dropped the tying touchdown pass.

The scapes (or stems) are hollow and tubular, up to {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|\u2013|3|mm|abbr=on|frac=16}} across, with a soft texture, although, prior to the emergence of a flower, they may appear stiffer than usual. The grass-like<ref name=\"Linford\"/> leaves, which are shorter than the scapes, are also hollow and tubular, or terete, (round in cross-section) which distinguishes it at a glance from [[Allium tuberosum|garlic chives]] (''Allium tuberosum''). The [[flower]]s are pale purple, and star-shaped with six [[petal]]s, {{convert|1|\u2013|2|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} wide, and produced in a dense [[inflorescence]] of 10-30 together; before opening, the inflorescence is surrounded by a papery [[bract]]. The [[seed]]s are produced in a small, three-valved capsule, maturing in summer. The herb flowers from April to May in the southern parts of its habitat zones and in June in the northern parts.<ref>[http://www.mobot.org/gardeninghelp/plantfinder/Plant.asp?code=J270 Allium schoenoprasum factsheet], from Kemper center for home gardening, retrieved on June 13, 2006, based on the position of the botanical Garden (Missouri)</ref><ref>[http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/mono/allia/alliu/allisch.html Gr\u00e4sl\u00f6k], from Den virtuella floran, retrieved on June 13, 2006, The facts mentioned on the site apply to Sweden, which is in the northern part of the habitat zone.</ref>\n\nChives are the only species of ''Allium'' native to both the [[New world|New]] and the [[Old World]]s.

The scapes (or stems) are hollow and tubular, up to {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|\u2013|3|mm|abbr=on|frac=16}} across, with a soft texture, although, prior to the emergence of a flower, they may appear stiffer than usual. The grass-like<ref name=\"Linford\"/> leaves, which are shorter than the scapes, are also hollow and tubular, or terete, (round in cross-section) which distinguishes it at a glance from [[Allium tuberosum|garlic chives]] (''Allium tuberosum''). The [[flower]]s are pale purple, and star-shaped with six [[petal]]s, {{convert|1|\u2013|2|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} wide, and produced in a dense [[inflorescence]] of 10-30 together; before opening, the inflorescence is surrounded by a papery [[bract]]. The [[seed]]s are produced in a small, three-valved capsule, maturing in summer. The herb flowers from April to May in the southern parts of its habitat zones and in June in the northern parts.<ref>[http://www.mobot.org/gardeninghelp/plantfinder/Plant.asp?code=J270 Allium schoenoprasum factsheet], from Kemper center for home gardening, retrieved on June 13, 2006, based on the position of the botanical Garden (Missouri)</ref><ref>[http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/mono/allia/alliu/allisch.html Gr\u00e4sl\u00f6k], from Den virtuella floran, retrieved on June 13, 2006, The facts mentioned on the site apply to Sweden, which is in the northern part of the habitat zone.</ref>\n\nChives are the only species of ''Allium'' native to both the [[New world|New]] and the [[Old World]]s.
