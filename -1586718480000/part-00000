A state minister arrives at the place of a local don, Rana. Rana forces the minister to sign a deal to open a resort at Anegudde. The minister signs reluctantly after seeing his bodyguard being murdered by Rana.\n\nThe scene next shifts to Prakash Raj introducing an ancient temple in the royal city of mysore called \"Shankara Narayana\" temple which is being managed by a holy Muth (holy association), headed by the pontiff ([[Anantnag]]). The Muth has a very good reputation by not being involved into any politics and also being equally revered by both Shaivites and Vaishnavites. Then comes into picture, the hero Krishna ([[Yash (actor)|Yash]]), with his mother [[Girija Lokesh]]. Krishna is a happy-go-lucky youth, a hard-core [[Rajkumar (actor)|Rajkumar]] fan, who has a kind heart for people and is involved in a small-time loan financing company. It is revealed that Krishna\u2019s family is very much devoted to the Muth and also that he was born after Krishna\u2019s father pledged that Krishna will be sent to become the next Pontiff of the Muth after [[Anantnag]]. In this context, Krishna is given a warm welcome at the Muth and is requested by the Muth head [[Anantnag]] to take up the spiritual leadership. Krishna refuses as he feels he is still attached to the worldly ambitions and he requests the pontiff to suggest an alternative. The Pontiff says that Krishna has to donate an elephant to the Muth, if he cannot take up the leadership of the Muth.\n\nKrishna first tries several ways to avoid taking up Sanyasa ashramam in various negative ways, but each time in his attempt, he is given full respect and protected.\n\nKrishna finally goes in search of the elephant and hence sets his foot in the forest of Aaneguddi. He takes the help of the local Forest officer \"Agni\" ([[Rangayana Raghu]]) who introduces him to the forest tribal people. The ancestors of these tribal people have been in that forest since centuries and have taken care of the local elephants. They befriend Krishna and some incidents make Krishna meet a single strong elephant \"Kalinga\", who is feared by the tribal folk for his roughness. Krishna also meets a young ecologist ([[Amulya]]).\n\nThe local don Rana hatches a plan to route out the local tribal folk from their homes and build a resort there. When he comes there with his henchmen, Krishna and Amoolya revolt and help the folk. Krishna fights the henchmen and creates fear in the mind of Rana. Rana takes his right-hand man Selva to kill Krishna and at this juncture, the elephant Kalinga comes to his rescue. \nThe head of the tribal folk sees Krishna reducing the anger of Kalinga and deduces that he is definitely the incarnation of Baahubali ([[Yash (actor)|Yash]]), a fierce warrior in the army of the King of Karunadu. The tribal chief then narrates the story about the valour of Baahubali. The king of Karunadu is about to be attacked by a king Verma. At this juncture, Baahubali defeats one of the strongest warriors of Verma. Saddened at this, Verma resorts to a cunning way and makes Baahubali\u2019s close friend poison Baahubali. When he is poisoned, Verma attacks him with his army along with the traitor minister of Karunadu. In spite of his dying state, Baahubali single-handedly defeats the entire army of Verma and kills them. In this fight, Baahubali loses his pet elephant \"Balarama\" (this is the elephant which has incarnated as Kalinga), who kills some of the enemy soldiers and dies. Finally, Baahubali dies and the king of Karunadu awards the title of \"Gajakesari\" to Baahubali for his meritorious act of bravery and his service to the Motherland.\n\nNow, Krishna having known his past life, faces Rana and his henchmen and is almost killed. The Pontiff Anantnag having sensed Krishna\u2019s battle for life, performs Mrityunjaya Homa at the Muth. This ritual strengthens Krishna and Kalinga aids him to finish off Rana and the henchmen. Finally, the Muth Pontiff arrives at the tribal village and tells Krishna that it was his destiny that he had to help the village tribal people and that he has to continue to protect them as he did in his previous birth. The Pontiff also tells him that he need not become the next successor to him nor donate any elephant to the Muth. He blesses Krishna to marry Meera(Amulya) and lead a prosperous life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Yash (actor)|Yash]] as Krishna / Bahubali\n* [[Amulya]] as Meera\n* [[Anant Nag]] as Pontiff of Shankara Narayana Mutt\n* [[John Vijay]] as Rana\n* [[Prabhakar (Telugu actor)|Prabhakar]] as Rana's henchmen\n* [[Shahbaz Khan (actor)|Shahbaz Khan]] as Raja Jayasurya Bahaddur \n* [[Rangayana Raghu]] as Forrest Officer Agni\n* [[Sadhu Kokila]] as Chuncha\n* [[Girija Lokesh]] as Yash's mother\n* [[Mandya Ramesh]] \n* Ashok Sharma \n*\n*H.

It begins with the discovery of the [[empty tomb]] by [[Mary Magdalene]], and [[Mary (mother of James the Less)|Mary the mother of James]], and [[Salome (disciple)|Salome]]. There they encounter a young man dressed in white who announces the [[resurrection of Jesus]] ([[#Verses 1\u20138|16:1-6]]). The two oldest manuscripts of Mark 16 (from the 300s) then conclude with verse 8, which ends with the women fleeing from the empty tomb, and saying \"nothing to anyone, because they were too frightened\".{{refn|group=note|{{bibleverse||Mark|16:1-8|NLT}}: [[New Living Translation]]: \"The most ancient manuscripts of Mark conclude with verse 16:8. Later manuscripts add one or both of the following endings ...\"}}\n\n[[Textual criticism of the New Testament|Textual critic]]s have identified two distinct alternative endings: the \"Longer Ending\" (vv. 9-20) and the unversed \"Shorter Ending\" or \"lost ending\",<ref>[[Jerusalem Bible]], footnote at Mark 16:8</ref> which appear together in six Greek manuscripts, and in dozens of [[Ethiopic]] copies. Modern versions of the New Testament generally include the Longer Ending, but place it in brackets or otherwise format it to show that it is not considered part of the original text.\n\n==Text==\nThe original text was written in [[Koine Greek]].\n\n===Textual witnesses===\nSome early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are:\n*[[Codex Vaticanus]] (325-350; extant verses 1-8)\n*[[Codex Sinaiticus]] (330-360; extant verses 1-8)\n*[[Codex Bezae]] (~400; complete: 1-20)\n*[[Codex Alexandrinus]] (400-440; complete: 1-20)\n*[[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]] (~450; complete: 1-20)\n\n=={{Anchor|Verses 1\u20138}}Verses 1-8 (the empty tomb)==\n{{multiple image\n | align             = right\n | direction         = horizontal\n | header_align      = center\n | header            = Tradition sites of [[Empty tomb|Jesus' tomb]]\n<!--image 1-->\n | image1            = The Garden Tomb 2008.jpg\n | width1            = 160\n | caption1          = \n<!--image 2-->\n | image2            = 5267-20080122-jerusalem-tomb-of-jesus.jpg\n | width2            = 80\n | caption2          = \n | footer_align      = center\n | footer            = Left: outside of [[Garden Tomb]]; right: inside of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]\n}}\n[[File:Tomb of christ sepulchre.jpg|thumb|280px|The Edicule of the Holy Sepulchre (The traditional location of Jesus' tomb) with the dome of the rotunda visible above.]]\n[[File:Holy sepulchre stone of the anoiting.jpg|thumb|The Stone of the Anointing, believed to be the place where Jesus' body was prepared for burial.]]\n{{see also|Empty tomb|Church of the Holy Sepulchre}}\n\n===Verses 1\u20132===\n:''{{sup|1}}Now when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, that they might come and anoint Him. {{sup|2}}Very early in the morning, on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen.''<ref>{{bibleref2|Mark|16:1-2|NKJV}} NKJV</ref> \nMark states that the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] is now over and, just after [[sunrise]], [[Mary Magdalene]], another Mary, the mother of James,<ref>[[Richard Bauckham|Bauckham, Richard]], ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses'' (Cambridge: Eerdmans, 2006), p. 50 n. 43.</ref> and [[Salome (disciple)|Salome]] come with [[spice]]s to [[anoint]] Jesus' body. These three are also mentioned \"looking on from afar\" in [[Mark 15:40]], although those who \"observed where He was laid\" in Mark 15:47 were only Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses.\n\n[[Luke 24:1]] states that the women had \"prepared\" the spices. {{bibleverse|John|19:40|KJV}} seems to say that [[Nicodemus]] had already anointed his body. [[John 20:1]] and [[Matthew 28:1]] simply say Mary went to the [[tomb]], but not why.\n\n===Verses 3\u20134===\n:''{{sup|3}}And they said among themselves, \u201cWho will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?\u201d {{sup|4}}But when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away\u2014for it was very large.''<ref>{{bibleref2|Mark|16:3-4|NKJV}} NKJV</ref>\n\nThe women wonder how they will remove the stone over the tomb. Upon their arrival, they find the stone already gone and go into the tomb. According to [[Jesuit]] writer John J. Kilgallen, this shows that in Mark's account they expected to find the body of Jesus.{{sfn|Kilgallen|1989|p=297}} Instead, they find a young man dressed in a white [[robe]] who is sitting on the right and who tells them that Jesus \"has risen\" and shows them \"the place where they laid him\" (verses 5\u20137).\n\n===Verses 5\u20137===\n{{quote|{{sup|5}}As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.\n{{sup|6}}\"Don't be alarmed,\" he said. \"You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified.

In the account in [[Gospel of Luke|Luke's gospel]] there were two men.<ref>{{bibleverse||Luke|24:4-5|NKJV}} NKJV</ref> John says there were two angels, but that Mary saw them after finding the empty tomb and showing it to the other disciples. She comes back to the tomb, talks to the angels, and then Jesus appears to her.\n\nMark uses the word ''[[neaniskos]]'' for young, a word he also used to describe the [[naked fugitive|man who fled]] at Jesus' arrest in {{bibleref2|Mark|14:51\u201352|NKJV}}.{{sfn|Brown ''et al.''|1990|p=629}} He is often thought of as an angel. Jesus had predicted his resurrection and returning to Galilee during the [[Last Supper]] in Mark ({{bibleverse|Mark|14:28|KJV}}).

And they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.<ref>{{bibleref2|Mark|16:8|NKJV}} NKJV</ref>}}\n\nMark 16:1-8 ends with the response of the women: Those women, who are afraid (compare {{bibleverse||Mark|10:32|ESV}}), then flee and keep quiet about what they saw. Kilgallen comments that fear is the most common human reaction to the divine presence in the Bible.{{sfn|Kilgallen|1989|p=300}}\n\nThis is where the undisputed part of Mark's Gospel ends.

In most modern-day translations based primarily on the [[Codex Alexandrinus|Alexandrian Text]], the longer ending is included, but is accompanied by brackets or by special notes, or both.\n\n====Text and interpretation====\nIn this 12-verse passage, the author refers to Jesus' appearances to Mary Magdalene, two disciples, and then the Eleven (the [[Twelve Apostles]] excluding Judas). The text concludes with the [[Great Commission]], declaring that believers that have been [[baptized]] will be [[Christian salvation|saved]] while nonbelievers will be condemned, and pictures Jesus [[Ascension of Christ|taken to Heaven]] and [[Session of Christ|sitting]] at the [[Right Hand of God]].<ref name=\"ActJTomb\" />\n\n{{bibleverse|Mark|16:9-11|KJV}}: Jesus appears to Mary Magdalene, who is now described as someone whom Jesus healed from [[Demonic possession|possession by seven demons]]. She then \"tells the other disciples\" what she saw, but no one believes her. \n\n{{bibleverse|Mark|16:12-13|KJV}}: Jesus appears \"in a different form\" to two unnamed disciples. They, too, are disbelieved when they tell what they saw. \n\n{{bibleverse|Mark|16:14-16|KJV}}: Jesus then appears at dinner to all the remaining eleven [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]]. He rebukes them for not believing the earlier reports of his resurrection and tells them to go and \"[[Great Commission|proclaim]] the good news to all creation. The one who believes and is [[Baptism|baptised]] will be [[Salvation in Christianity|saved]]; but the one who does not believe will be condemned.\" [[Belief]] and non-belief are a dominant theme in the Longer Ending: there are two references to believing (verses 16 and 17) and four references to not believing (verses 11, 13, 14 and 16). [[Johann Albrecht Bengel]], in his ''Gnomon of the New Testament'', defends the disciples: \"They did believe: but presently there recurred to them a suspicion as to the truth, and even positive unbelief\".<ref group=web>[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/mark/16.htm Bengel's Gnomon of the New Testament on Mark 16], accessed 14 December 2017</ref>\n\n{{bibleverse|Mark|16:17-18|KJV}}: Jesus states that believers will \"speak in new tongues\". They will also be able to [[Snake handling|handle snakes]], be immune from any [[poison]] they might happen to drink, and will be able to heal the sick. Kilgallen, picturing an author putting words in Jesus' mouth, has suggested that these verses were a means by which [[early Christians]] asserted that their new faith was accompanied by special powers.{{sfn|Kilgallen|1989|p=309}} According to Brown, by showing examples of unjustified unbelief in verses 10-13, and stating that unbelievers will be condemned and that believers will be validated by signs, the author may have been attempting to convince the reader to rely on what the disciples preached about Jesus.{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=149}}\n\n{{bibleverse|Mark|16:19|KJV}}: Jesus is then taken up into heaven where, Mark claims, he sits at the right hand of [[God]]. The author refers to [[Book of Psalms|Psalm]] 110:1, quoted in Mark 11, about the Lord sitting at the right hand of God.\n\n{{bibleverse|Mark|16:20|KJV}}: the eleven go out and \"proclaimed the good news everywhere\"; this is known as the [[Dispersion of the Apostles]]. Several [[sign]]s from God accompanied their preaching. Where these things happened is not stated, but one could presume, from {{bibleverse|Mark|16:7|KJV}}, that they took place in [[Galilee]]. [[Luke-Acts]], however, has this happening in [[Jerusalem]].\n\n===Shorter ending of Mark (unversed)===\nThe \"Shorter Ending\" (first manuscript c. 3rd century<ref name=\"Tolbert\"/>), with slight variations, is usually unversed, and runs as follows:\n{{quote|But they reported briefly to Peter and those with him all that they had been told. And after this, Jesus himself (appeared to them and) sent out by means of them, from east to west, the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation.}}\n\nWhile the New Revised Standard Version places this verse between verse 8 and 9, it could also be read as verse 21, covering the same topics as verse 9-20.<ref group=web>[http://www.textexcavation.com/marcanendings.html#abrupt ''The endings of the gospel of Mark.'']</ref>\n\n== Manuscript versions ==\n\n=== Manuscripts without either ending===\n[[File:Mark16-B.JPG|right|thumb|250x250px|Mark ends at 16:8 in the 4th-century [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209]]]]\n\nThe earliest extant complete manuscripts of Mark, [[Codex Sinaiticus]] and [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]], two 4th-century manuscripts, do not contain the last twelve verses, 16:9\u201320, nor the unversed shorter ending.{{refn|group=note|[[Papyrus 45]] is the oldest extant manuscript that contains text from Mark, but it has no text from chapter 16 due to extensive damage.}} Codex Vaticanus (4th century) has a blank column after ending at 16:8 and placing ''kata Markon'', \"according to Mark\". There are three other blank columns in Vaticanus, in the Old Testament, but they are each due to incidental factors in the production of the codex: a change to the column-format, a change of scribes, and the conclusion of the Old Testament portion of the text. The blank column between Mark 16:8 and the beginning of Luke, however, is deliberately placed.<!-- It has been suggested that Codex Vaticanus may be reflecting a Western order of the gospels with Mark as the last book (Matthew, John, Luke, and Mark).-->{{refn|group=note|According to T. C. Skeat, Sinaiticus and Vaticanus were both produced at the same scriptorium, which would mean that they represent only one textual tradition, rather than serving as two independent witnesses of an earlier text type that ends at 16:8.<ref>T. C. Skeat, \"The Codex Sinaiticus, the Codex Vaticanus, and Constantine\", in ''Journal of Theological Studies'' 50 (1999), 583-625.</ref> Skeat argued that they were produced as part of Eusebius' response to the request of [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine]] for copies of the scriptures for churches in Constantinople.{{sfn|Skeat|1999|pp=604-609}} However, there are about 3,036 differences between the Gospels of Sinaiticus and Vaticanus, and in particular the text of Sinaiticus is of the so-called Western text form in [[John 1:1]] through {{bibleverse-nb|John|8:38|KJV}} while Vaticanus is not. Also against the theory that Eusebius directed the copying of both manuscripts is the fact that neither Vaticanus nor Sinaiticus contains {{bibleverse|Mark|15:28|KJV}}, which Eusebius accepted and included in his Canon-tables,<ref>Section 217, Column 6</ref> and Vaticanus and Sinaiticus both include a reading at {{bibleverse|Matthew|27:49|KJV}} about which Eusebius seems to have been completely unaware. Finally, there is a significant relationship between Codex Vaticanus and papyrus [[Papyrus 75|P75]], indicating that the two bear a remarkable relationship to one another\u2014one that is not shared by Codex Sinaiticus. P75 is much older than either, having been copied prior to the birth of Eusebius.{{sfn|Epp|1993|p=289}} Therefore, both manuscripts were not transcribed from the same exemplar and were not associated with Eusebius. The evidence presented by Skeat sufficiently shows that the two codices were made at the same place, and that the place in question was Caesarea, and that they almost certainly shared a copyist, but the differences between the manuscripts can be better explained by other theories.}}\n\nOther manuscripts which omit the last twelve verses include: [[Syriac Sinaiticus]] (late 4th-century); [[Minuscule 304]] (12th century); a Sahidic manuscript; over 100 Armenian manuscripts; the two oldest Georgian manuscripts.

Possibly a scribe regarded John 21 as a better sequel to Mark's account, and considered the \"Longer Ending\" superfluous.}}\n\n===Ending at verse 8===\nAmong the scholars who reject Mark 16:9\u201320, a debate continues about whether the ending at 16:8 is intentional or accidental.{{sfn|Stein|2008|p=79}}<ref group=web name=\"Smith\"/>\n\n====Intentional====\nNumerous arguments have been given to explain why verse 8 is the intended ending.{{sfn|Stein|2008|p=79}}<ref group=web name=\"Smith\"/>\n\nThere is scholarly work that suggests the \"short ending\" is more appropriate as it fits with the 'reversal of expectation' theme in the Gospel of Mark.<ref name=\"MacDonald\">[[Dennis R. MacDonald|MacDonald, Dennis R.]] ''Homeric Epics and the Gospel of Mark, by Dennis R. MacDonald'', Pages 42, 70, 175, 213''</ref> Having the women run away afraid is contrasted in the reader's mind with Jesus' appearances and statements which help confirm the expectation, built up in {{bibleref|Mark|8:31}}, {{bibleref|Mark|9:31}}, {{bibleref|Mark|10:34}}, and Jesus' prediction during the Last Supper of his rising after his death.{{sfn|Miller|1994|p=52}} According to Brown, this ending is consistent with Mark's theology, where even miracles, such as the resurrection, do not produce the proper understanding or faith among Jesus' followers.{{sfn|Kilgallen|1989|p=148}} [[Richard A. Burridge]] argues that, in keeping with Mark's picture of discipleship, the question of whether it all comes right in the end is left open:\n{{quote|Mark's story of Jesus becomes the story of his followers, and their story becomes the story of the readers. Whether they will follow or desert, believe or misunderstand, see him in Galilee or remain staring blindly into an empty tomb, depends on us.<ref>Burridge, Richard A. (2005) ''Four Gospels, One Jesus? A Symbolic Reading'' (2nd ed., Grand Rapids: Eerdmans), 64.</ref>}}\n\nBurridge compares the ending of [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] to its [[Mark 1|beginning]]:\n{{quote|Mark's narrative as we have it now ends as abruptly as it began.

No one knew where he came from; no one knows where he has gone; and not many understood him when he was here.{{sfn|Burridge|2005|pp=64-65}}}}\n\nKilgallen proposes that maybe Mark gives no description of the resurrected Jesus because Mark did not want to try to describe the nature of the divine resurrected Jesus.{{sfn|Kilgallen|1989|p=303}} Some interpreters have concluded that Mark's intended readers already knew the traditions of [[Resurrection appearances of Jesus|Jesus' appearances]], and that Mark brings the story to a close here to highlight the resurrection and leave anticipation of the [[Second Coming|''parousia'']] (Second Coming).{{sfn|Brown ''et al.''|1990|p=628}} Others have argued that this announcement of the resurrection and Jesus going to Galilee is the ''parousia'' (see also [[Preterism]]), but [[Raymond E. Brown]] argues that a ''parousia'' confined only to Galilee is improbable.{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=148}}\n\nThe final sentence in verse 8 is regarded as strange by some scholars. In the Greek text, it finishes with the conjunction \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1 (''gar'', \"for\"). It is contended by some who see 16:9\u201320 as originally Markan that \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1 literally means ''because'', and this ending to verse 8 is therefore not grammatically coherent (literally, it would read ''they were afraid because''). However, \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1 may end a sentence and does so in various Greek compositions, including some sentences in the [[Septuagint]]. Protagoras, a contemporary of Socrates, even ended a speech with \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1. Although \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1 is never the first word of a sentence, there is no rule against it being the last word, even though it is not a common construction.{{sfn|Stein|2008|p=88-89}} If the Gospel of Mark intentionally concluded with this word, it would be one of only a few narratives in antiquity to do so.{{sfn|Stein|2008|p=91}}\n\n====Unintentional====\nSome scholars argue that Mark never intended to end so abruptly: either he planned another ending that was never written, or the original ending has been lost. The references to a future meeting in [[Galilee]] between Jesus and the disciples (in Mark 14:28 and 16:7) could suggest that Mark intended to write beyond 16:8.<ref name=\"May Metzger\" /> [[C. H. Turner]] argued that the original version of the [[Gospel]] could have been a [[codex]], with the last page being especially vulnerable to damage. Many scholars, including [[Rudolf Bultmann]], have concluded that the Gospel most likely ended with a Galilean resurrection appearance and the reconciliation of Jesus with the Eleven,<ref>R.

On linguistics, E. P. Gould identified 19 of the 163 words in the passage as distinctive and not occurring elsewhere in the Gospel.<ref>E. P. Gould, ''A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Gospel According to St. Mark'' (New York: Charles Scribner's Press, 1896), p. 303.</ref> Dr. Bruce Terry argues that a vocabulary-based case against Mark 16:9\u201320 is indecisive, inasmuch as other 12-verse sections of Mark contain comparable numbers of once-used words.<ref>\"The Style of the Long Ending of Mark\" by Dr. Bruce Terry at http://bterry.com/articles/mkendsty.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708102127/http://bterry.com/articles/mkendsty.htm |date=2011-07-08 }}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Gundry]] mentions that only about 10% of Mark's \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1 clauses (6 out of 66) conclude [[pericope]]s.<ref>Grundy, Robert. ''Mark: A Commentary on His Apology for the Cross, Chapters 9\u201316''</ref> Thus he infers that, rather than concluding 16:1\u20138, verse 8 begins a new pericope, the rest of which is now lost to us. Gundry therefore does not see verse 8 as the intended ending; a [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] narrative was either written, then lost, or planned but never actually written.\n\nConcerning style, the degree to which verses 9\u201320 aptly fit as an ending for the Gospel remains in question. The turn from verse 8 to 9 has also been seen as abrupt and interrupted: the narrative flows from \"they were afraid\" to \"now after he rose\", and seems to reintroduce Mary Magdalene. Secondly, Mark regularly identifies instances where Jesus' prophecies are fulfilled, yet Mark does not explicitly state the twice predicted reconciliation of Jesus with his disciples in Galilee (Mark 14:28, 16:7). Lastly, the active tense \"he rose\" is different from the earlier passive construction \"[he] has been risen\" of verse 6, seen as significant by some.{{sfn|Kilgallen|1989|p=306}}\n\n====Dating====\nBecause of [[patristic]] evidence from the late 100s for the existence of copies of Mark with 16:9-20,{{refn|group=note|Patristic evidence:\n* The earliest clear evidence for Mark 16:9-20 as part of the Gospel of Mark is in Chapter XLV First Apology of [[Justin Martyr]] (c. 160). In a passage in which Justin treats Psalm 110 as a Messianic prophecy, he states that Psalm 110:2 was fulfilled when Jesus' disciples, going forth from Jerusalem, preached everywhere. His wording is remarkably similar to the wording of Mk. 16:20 and is consistent with Justin's use of a Synoptics-Harmony in which Mark 16:20 was blended with Lk. 24:53.\n* Justin's student [[Tatian]] (c. 172), incorporated almost all of Mark 16:9-20 into his ''[[Diatessaron]]'', a blended narrative consisting of material from all four canonical Gospels.\n* [[Irenaeus]] (c. 184), in ''Against Heresies'' 3:10.6, explicitly cited Mark 16:19, stating that he was quoting from near the end of Mark's account. This patristic evidence is over a century older than the earliest manuscript of Mark 16.\n* Writers in the 200s such as [[Hippolytus of Rome]] and the anonymous author of ''De Rebaptismate'' also used the \"Longer Ending\".\n* In 305, the pagan writer Hierocles used Mark 16:18 in a jibe against Christians, probably recycling material written by [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in 270.\n* [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], in his Gospel Problems and Solutions to Marinus No. 1, writes toward the beginning of the fourth century, \"One who athetises that pericope would say that it [i.e., a verse from the ending of Mark] is not found in all copies of the gospel according to Mark: accurate copies end their text of the Marcan account with the words of the young man whom the women saw, and who said to them: 'Do not be afraid; it is Jesus the Nazarene that you are looking for, etc.', after which it adds: 'And when they heard this, they ran away, and said nothing to anyone, because they were frightened.' That is where the text does end, in almost all copies of the gospel according to Mark. What occasionally follows in some copies, not all, would be extraneous, most particularly if it contained something contradictory to the evidence of the other evangelists.\"}} it is contended by some scholars that this passage must have been written and attached no later than the early 2nd century.<ref name=\"May Metzger\" /> However, as the oldest copies of Mark, dating from the 4th century, do not include verses 9-20, textual evidence tends to support a relatively late insertion of the Great Commission - from the 4th century or later.<ref name=\"ActJTomb\" /> \n\n====Aimed addition or independent longer ending====\nScholars are divided on the question of whether the \"Longer Ending\" was created deliberately to finish the Gospel of Mark, as contended by James Kelhoffer, or if it began its existence as a freestanding text which was used to \"patch\" the otherwise abruptly ending text of Mark. Metzger and Ehrman note that\n{{quote|Since Mark was not responsible for the composition of the last 12 verses of the generally current form of his Gospel and since they undoubtedly were attached to the Gospel before the [Christian] Church recognized the fourfold Gospels as canonical, it follows that the New Testament contains not four but five canonized witnesses to the Resurrection of Christ.<ref group=web name=\"Smith\"/>}}\n\n====Intertextuality====\nVerses 9\u201320 share the subject of Jesus' post-resurrection appearances, and other points, with other passages in the New Testament. This has led some scholars to believe that Mark 16:9\u201320 is based on the other books of the New Testament, filling in details which were originally lacking from Mark. Jesus' reference to drinking poison (16:18) does not correspond to a New Testament source, but that miraculous power did appear in Christian literature from the 2nd century CE on.<ref name=\"May Metzger\">May, Herbert G. and Bruce M.

There they encounter a young man dressed in white who announces the [[resurrection of Jesus]] ([[#Verses 1\u20138|16:1-6]]).

In most modern-day translations based primarily on the [[Codex Alexandrinus|Alexandrian Text]], the longer ending is included, but is accompanied by brackets or by special notes, or both.\n\n====Text and interpretation====\nIn this 12-verse passage, the author refers to Jesus' appearances to Mary Magdalene, two disciples, and then the Eleven (the [[Twelve Apostles]] excluding Judas). The text concludes with the [[Great Commission]], declaring that believers that have been [[baptized]] will be [[Christian salvation|saved]] while nonbelievers will be condemned, and pictures Jesus [[Ascension of Christ|taken to Heaven]] and [[Session of Christ|sitting]] at the [[Right Hand of God]].<ref name=\"ActJTomb\" />\n\n{{bibleverse|Mark|16:9-11|KJV}}: Jesus appears to Mary Magdalene, who is now described as someone whom Jesus healed from [[Demonic possession|possession by seven demons]]. She then \"tells the other disciples\" what she saw, but no one believes her. \n\n{{bibleverse|Mark|16:12-13|KJV}}: Jesus appears \"in a different form\" to two unnamed disciples. They, too, are disbelieved when they tell what they saw. \n\n{{bibleverse|Mark|16:14-16|KJV}}: Jesus then appears at dinner to all the remaining eleven [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]]. He rebukes them for not believing the earlier reports of his resurrection and tells them to go and \"[[Great Commission|proclaim]] the good news to all creation. The one who believes and is [[Baptism|baptised]] will be [[Salvation in Christianity|saved]]; but the one who does not believe will be condemned.\" [[Belief]] and non-belief are a dominant theme in the Longer Ending: there are two references to believing (verses 16 and 17) and four references to not believing (verses 11, 13, 14 and 16). [[Johann Albrecht Bengel]], in his ''Gnomon of the New Testament'', defends the disciples: \"They did believe: but presently there recurred to them a suspicion as to the truth, and even positive unbelief\".<ref group=web>[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/mark/16.htm Bengel's Gnomon of the New Testament on Mark 16], accessed 14 December 2017</ref>\n\n{{bibleverse|Mark|16:17-18|KJV}}: Jesus states that believers will \"speak in new tongues\". They will also be able to [[Snake handling|handle snakes]], be immune from any [[poison]] they might happen to drink, and will be able to heal the sick. Kilgallen, picturing an author putting words in Jesus' mouth, has suggested that these verses were a means by which [[early Christians]] asserted that their new faith was accompanied by special powers.{{sfn|Kilgallen|1989|p=309}} According to Brown, by showing examples of unjustified unbelief in verses 10-13, and stating that unbelievers will be condemned and that believers will be validated by signs, the author may have been attempting to convince the reader to rely on what the disciples preached about Jesus.{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=149}}\n\n{{bibleverse|Mark|16:19|KJV}}: Jesus is then taken up into heaven where, Mark claims, he sits at the right hand of [[God]]. The author refers to [[Book of Psalms|Psalm]] 110:1, quoted in Mark 11, about the Lord sitting at the right hand of God.\n\n{{bibleverse|Mark|16:20|KJV}}: the eleven go out and \"proclaimed the good news everywhere\"; this is known as the [[Dispersion of the Apostles]]. Several [[sign]]s from God accompanied their preaching. Where these things happened is not stated, but one could presume, from {{bibleverse|Mark|16:7|KJV}}, that they took place in [[Galilee]]. [[Luke-Acts]], however, has this happening in [[Jerusalem]].\n\n===Shorter ending of Mark (unversed)===\nThe \"Shorter Ending\" (first manuscript c. 3rd century<ref name=\"Tolbert\"/>), with slight variations, is usually unversed, and runs as follows:\n{{quote|But they reported briefly to Peter and those with him all that they had been told. And after this, Jesus himself (appeared to them and) sent out by means of them, from east to west, the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation.}}\n\nWhile the New Revised Standard Version places this verse between verse 8 and 9, it could also be read as verse 21, covering the same topics as verse 9-20.<ref group=web>[http://www.textexcavation.com/marcanendings.html#abrupt ''The endings of the gospel of Mark.'']</ref>\n\n== Manuscript versions ==\n\n=== Manuscripts without either ending===\n[[File:Mark16-B.JPG|right|thumb|250x250px|Mark ends at 16:8 in the 4th-century [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209]]]]\n\nThe earliest extant complete manuscripts of Mark, [[Codex Sinaiticus]] and [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]], two 4th-century manuscripts, do not contain the last twelve verses, 16:9\u201320, nor the unversed shorter ending.{{refn|group=note|[[Papyrus 45]] is the oldest extant manuscript that contains text from Mark, but it has no text from chapter 16 due to extensive damage.}} Codex Vaticanus (4th century) has a blank column after ending at 16:8 and placing ''kata Markon'', \"according to Mark\". There are three other blank columns in Vaticanus, in the Old Testament, but they are each due to incidental factors in the production of the codex: a change to the column-format, a change of scribes, and the conclusion of the Old Testament portion of the text. The blank column between Mark 16:8 and the beginning of Luke, however, is deliberately placed.<!-- It has been suggested that Codex Vaticanus may be reflecting a Western order of the gospels with Mark as the last book (Matthew, John, Luke, and Mark).-->{{refn|group=note|According to T. C. Skeat, Sinaiticus and Vaticanus were both produced at the same scriptorium, which would mean that they represent only one textual tradition, rather than serving as two independent witnesses of an earlier text type that ends at 16:8.<ref>T. C. Skeat, \"The Codex Sinaiticus, the Codex Vaticanus, and Constantine\", in ''Journal of Theological Studies'' 50 (1999), 583-625.</ref> Skeat argued that they were produced as part of Eusebius' response to the request of [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine]] for copies of the scriptures for churches in Constantinople.{{sfn|Skeat|1999|pp=604-609}} However, there are about 3,036 differences between the Gospels of Sinaiticus and Vaticanus, and in particular the text of Sinaiticus is of the so-called Western text form in [[John 1:1]] through {{bibleverse-nb|John|8:38|KJV}} while Vaticanus is not. Also against the theory that Eusebius directed the copying of both manuscripts is the fact that neither Vaticanus nor Sinaiticus contains {{bibleverse|Mark|15:28|KJV}}, which Eusebius accepted and included in his Canon-tables,<ref>Section 217, Column 6</ref> and Vaticanus and Sinaiticus both include a reading at {{bibleverse|Matthew|27:49|KJV}} about which Eusebius seems to have been completely unaware. Finally, there is a significant relationship between Codex Vaticanus and papyrus [[Papyrus 75|P75]], indicating that the two bear a remarkable relationship to one another\u2014one that is not shared by Codex Sinaiticus. P75 is much older than either, having been copied prior to the birth of Eusebius.{{sfn|Epp|1993|p=289}} Therefore, both manuscripts were not transcribed from the same exemplar and were not associated with Eusebius. The evidence presented by Skeat sufficiently shows that the two codices were made at the same place, and that the place in question was Caesarea, and that they almost certainly shared a copyist, but the differences between the manuscripts can be better explained by other theories.}}\n\nOther manuscripts which omit the last twelve verses include: [[Syriac Sinaiticus]] (late 4th-century); [[Minuscule 304]] (12th century); a Sahidic manuscript; over 100 Armenian manuscripts; the two oldest Georgian manuscripts.

Possibly a scribe regarded John 21 as a better sequel to Mark's account, and considered the \"Longer Ending\" superfluous.}}\n\n===Ending at verse 8===\nAmong the scholars who reject Mark 16:9\u201320, a debate continues about whether the ending at 16:8 is intentional or accidental.{{sfn|Stein|2008|p=79}}<ref group=web name=\"Smith\"/>\n\n====Intentional====\nNumerous arguments have been given to explain why verse 8 is the intended ending.{{sfn|Stein|2008|p=79}}<ref group=web name=\"Smith\"/>\n\nThere is scholarly work that suggests the \"short ending\" is more appropriate as it fits with the 'reversal of expectation' theme in the Gospel of Mark.<ref name=\"MacDonald\">[[Dennis R. MacDonald|MacDonald, Dennis R.]] ''Homeric Epics and the Gospel of Mark, by Dennis R. MacDonald'', Pages 42, 70, 175, 213''</ref> Having the women run away afraid is contrasted in the reader's mind with Jesus' appearances and statements which help confirm the expectation, built up in {{bibleref|Mark|8:31}}, {{bibleref|Mark|9:31}}, {{bibleref|Mark|10:34}}, and Jesus' prediction during the Last Supper of his rising after his death.{{sfn|Miller|1994|p=52}} According to Brown, this ending is consistent with Mark's theology, where even miracles, such as the resurrection, do not produce the proper understanding or faith among Jesus' followers.{{sfn|Kilgallen|1989|p=148}} [[Richard A. Burridge]] argues that, in keeping with Mark's picture of discipleship, the question of whether it all comes right in the end is left open:\n{{quote|Mark's story of Jesus becomes the story of his followers, and their story becomes the story of the readers. Whether they will follow or desert, believe or misunderstand, see him in Galilee or remain staring blindly into an empty tomb, depends on us.<ref>Burridge, Richard A. (2005) ''Four Gospels, One Jesus? A Symbolic Reading'' (2nd ed., Grand Rapids: Eerdmans), 64.</ref>}}\n\nBurridge compares the ending of [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] to its [[Mark 1|beginning]]:\n{{quote|Mark's narrative as we have it now ends as abruptly as it began. There was no introduction or background to Jesus' arrival, and none for his departure. No one knew where he came from; no one knows where he has gone; and not many understood him when he was here.{{sfn|Burridge|2005|pp=64-65}}}}\n\nKilgallen proposes that maybe Mark gives no description of the resurrected Jesus because Mark did not want to try to describe the nature of the divine resurrected Jesus.{{sfn|Kilgallen|1989|p=303}} Some interpreters have concluded that Mark's intended readers already knew the traditions of [[Resurrection appearances of Jesus|Jesus' appearances]], and that Mark brings the story to a close here to highlight the resurrection and leave anticipation of the [[Second Coming|''parousia'']] (Second Coming).{{sfn|Brown ''et al.''|1990|p=628}} Others have argued that this announcement of the resurrection and Jesus going to Galilee is the ''parousia'' (see also [[Preterism]]), but [[Raymond E. Brown]] argues that a ''parousia'' confined only to Galilee is improbable.{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=148}}\n\nThe final sentence in verse 8 is regarded as strange by some scholars. In the Greek text, it finishes with the conjunction \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1 (''gar'', \"for\"). It is contended by some who see 16:9\u201320 as originally Markan that \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1 literally means ''because'', and this ending to verse 8 is therefore not grammatically coherent (literally, it would read ''they were afraid because''). However, \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1 may end a sentence and does so in various Greek compositions, including some sentences in the [[Septuagint]]. Protagoras, a contemporary of Socrates, even ended a speech with \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1. Although \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1 is never the first word of a sentence, there is no rule against it being the last word, even though it is not a common construction.{{sfn|Stein|2008|p=88-89}} If the Gospel of Mark intentionally concluded with this word, it would be one of only a few narratives in antiquity to do so.{{sfn|Stein|2008|p=91}}\n\n====Unintentional====\nSome scholars argue that Mark never intended to end so abruptly: either he planned another ending that was never written, or the original ending has been lost. The references to a future meeting in [[Galilee]] between Jesus and the disciples (in Mark 14:28 and 16:7) could suggest that Mark intended to write beyond 16:8.<ref name=\"May Metzger\" /> [[C. H. Turner]] argued that the original version of the [[Gospel]] could have been a [[codex]], with the last page being especially vulnerable to damage. Many scholars, including [[Rudolf Bultmann]], have concluded that the Gospel most likely ended with a Galilean resurrection appearance and the reconciliation of Jesus with the Eleven,<ref>R.

On linguistics, E. P. Gould identified 19 of the 163 words in the passage as distinctive and not occurring elsewhere in the Gospel.<ref>E. P. Gould, ''A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Gospel According to St. Mark'' (New York: Charles Scribner's Press, 1896), p. 303.</ref> Dr. Bruce Terry argues that a vocabulary-based case against Mark 16:9\u201320 is indecisive, inasmuch as other 12-verse sections of Mark contain comparable numbers of once-used words.<ref>\"The Style of the Long Ending of Mark\" by Dr. Bruce Terry at http://bterry.com/articles/mkendsty.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708102127/http://bterry.com/articles/mkendsty.htm |date=2011-07-08 }}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Gundry]] mentions that only about 10% of Mark's \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1 clauses (6 out of 66) conclude [[pericope]]s.<ref>Grundy, Robert. ''Mark: A Commentary on His Apology for the Cross, Chapters 9\u201316''</ref> Thus he infers that, rather than concluding 16:1\u20138, verse 8 begins a new pericope, the rest of which is now lost to us. Gundry therefore does not see verse 8 as the intended ending; a [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] narrative was either written, then lost, or planned but never actually written.\n\nConcerning style, the degree to which verses 9\u201320 aptly fit as an ending for the Gospel remains in question. The turn from verse 8 to 9 has also been seen as abrupt and interrupted: the narrative flows from \"they were afraid\" to \"now after he rose\", and seems to reintroduce Mary Magdalene. Secondly, Mark regularly identifies instances where Jesus' prophecies are fulfilled, yet Mark does not explicitly state the twice predicted reconciliation of Jesus with his disciples in Galilee (Mark 14:28, 16:7). Lastly, the active tense \"he rose\" is different from the earlier passive construction \"[he] has been risen\" of verse 6, seen as significant by some.{{sfn|Kilgallen|1989|p=306}}\n\n====Dating====\nBecause of [[patristic]] evidence from the late 100s for the existence of copies of Mark with 16:9-20,{{refn|group=note|Patristic evidence:\n* The earliest clear evidence for Mark 16:9-20 as part of the Gospel of Mark is in Chapter XLV First Apology of [[Justin Martyr]] (c. 160). In a passage in which Justin treats Psalm 110 as a Messianic prophecy, he states that Psalm 110:2 was fulfilled when Jesus' disciples, going forth from Jerusalem, preached everywhere. His wording is remarkably similar to the wording of Mk. 16:20 and is consistent with Justin's use of a Synoptics-Harmony in which Mark 16:20 was blended with Lk. 24:53.\n* Justin's student [[Tatian]] (c. 172), incorporated almost all of Mark 16:9-20 into his ''[[Diatessaron]]'', a blended narrative consisting of material from all four canonical Gospels.\n* [[Irenaeus]] (c. 184), in ''Against Heresies'' 3:10.6, explicitly cited Mark 16:19, stating that he was quoting from near the end of Mark's account. This patristic evidence is over a century older than the earliest manuscript of Mark 16.\n* Writers in the 200s such as [[Hippolytus of Rome]] and the anonymous author of ''De Rebaptismate'' also used the \"Longer Ending\".\n* In 305, the pagan writer Hierocles used Mark 16:18 in a jibe against Christians, probably recycling material written by [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in 270.\n* [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], in his Gospel Problems and Solutions to Marinus No. 1, writes toward the beginning of the fourth century, \"One who athetises that pericope would say that it [i.e., a verse from the ending of Mark] is not found in all copies of the gospel according to Mark: accurate copies end their text of the Marcan account with the words of the young man whom the women saw, and who said to them: 'Do not be afraid; it is Jesus the Nazarene that you are looking for, etc.', after which it adds: 'And when they heard this, they ran away, and said nothing to anyone, because they were frightened.' That is where the text does end, in almost all copies of the gospel according to Mark. What occasionally follows in some copies, not all, would be extraneous, most particularly if it contained something contradictory to the evidence of the other evangelists.\"}} it is contended by some scholars that this passage must have been written and attached no later than the early 2nd century.<ref name=\"May Metzger\" /> However, as the oldest copies of Mark, dating from the 4th century, do not include verses 9-20, textual evidence tends to support a relatively late insertion of the Great Commission - from the 4th century or later.<ref name=\"ActJTomb\" /> \n\n====Aimed addition or independent longer ending====\nScholars are divided on the question of whether the \"Longer Ending\" was created deliberately to finish the Gospel of Mark, as contended by James Kelhoffer, or if it began its existence as a freestanding text which was used to \"patch\" the otherwise abruptly ending text of Mark. Metzger and Ehrman note that\n{{quote|Since Mark was not responsible for the composition of the last 12 verses of the generally current form of his Gospel and since they undoubtedly were attached to the Gospel before the [Christian] Church recognized the fourfold Gospels as canonical, it follows that the New Testament contains not four but five canonized witnesses to the Resurrection of Christ.<ref group=web name=\"Smith\"/>}}\n\n====Intertextuality====\nVerses 9\u201320 share the subject of Jesus' post-resurrection appearances, and other points, with other passages in the New Testament. This has led some scholars to believe that Mark 16:9\u201320 is based on the other books of the New Testament, filling in details which were originally lacking from Mark. Jesus' reference to drinking poison (16:18) does not correspond to a New Testament source, but that miraculous power did appear in Christian literature from the 2nd century CE on.<ref name=\"May Metzger\">May, Herbert G. and Bruce M. Metzger. The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha. 1977.</ref>\n\nJulie M. Smith notes that if there was an original ending, \"then the Resurrection accounts in Matthew and/or Luke may contain material from Mark\u2019s original ending.<ref group=web name=\"Smith\"/>\n\n===Shorter ending===\nThe shorter ending appears only in a minimal number of manuscripts as the sole ending.{{sfn|Lunn|2015|p=57}} It is a quick summary, which contradicts verse 8.{{sfn|Lunn|2015|p=57}} It probably originated in Egypt,{{sfn|Lunn|2015|p=57}} and diverges from the style of Mark.{{sfn|Lunn|2015|p=168, 170}}<ref group=web name=\"Smith\"/> The shorter ending appears in a manuscript sometime after the 3rd century.<ref name=\"Tolbert\">Tolbert, Mary Ann (2003), ''The Gospel According to Mark'', p. 1844.
