group who share a common [[Culture of Taiwan|Taiwanese culture]] and speak [[languages of Taiwan|Mandarin Chinese, Hokkien, Hakka, or Formosan Aboriginal languages]] as a mother tongue. Taiwanese people may also refer to individuals who either claim or are imputed [[cultural identity]] focused on Taiwan or areas under the control of the [[Government of the Republic of China]] since 1945, including [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]], and [[Matsu islands]] (see [[Free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan Area]]). At least three competing (occasionally overlapping) paradigms are used to identify someone as a Taiwanese person: nationalist criteria, [[self-identification]] (including the concept of \"New Taiwanese\") criteria, and socio-cultural criteria. These standards are fluid, and result from evolving social and political issues. The complexity resulting from competing and evolving standards is compounded by a larger dispute regarding Taiwan's identity, the [[political status of Taiwan]], and its potential ''[[de jure]]'' [[Taiwan independence]] or [[Cross-Strait Unification]].\n\nAccording to government figures, over 95% of Taiwan's population of 23.7 million consists of [[Han Chinese]], while 5% are [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] [[Formosan aborigines]]. The category of Han Chinese consists of the three main groups: [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]], [[Hakka people|Hakka]], and [[mainland Chinese]].{{sfnp|Copper|2003|pp=12-13}}{{sfnp|Hsiau|2005|p=105}} However, acculturation, intermarriage and assimilation have resulted in some degree of mixing of the Han and Formosan(Taiwanese) Aborigine blood lines. Although the concept of the \"four great ethnic groups\" was alleged to be the deliberate attempt by the Hoklo-dominated [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) to defuse ethnic tensions, this conception has become a dominant frame of reference for dealing with Taiwanese ethnic and national issues.{{sfnp|Makeham|2005|pp=4-5}}\n\nDespite the wide use of the \"four great ethnic groups\" in public discourse as essentialized identities, the relationships between the peoples of Taiwan have been in a constant state of convergence and negotiation for centuries. The continuing process of cross-ethnic mixing with ethnicities from within and outside Taiwan, combined with the disappearance of ethnic barriers due to a shared socio-political experience, has led to the emergence of \"Taiwanese\" as a larger [[ethnic group]],{{sfnp|Harrell|Huang|1994|pp=14\u201315}} except on the island of Kinmen whose populace consider themselves as [[Kinmen]]ese or [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], and as well as inhabitant of [[Matsu Islands]] whereby they also consider themselves as Matsunese or Chinese.<ref name=\"di Genova\">{{cite news |last=di Genova |first=Trista |date=11 July 2007 |url = http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/114701.htm |title=Study explores the 'Kinmen Identity' |newspaper=China Post |accessdate=20 January 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"uri.edu\">{{cite journal |last=Wei |first=Jian-Feng |url=http://www.uri.edu/iaics/content/2006v15n1/13%20Jian-Feng%20Wei.pdf |title=An Examination of Cultural Identity of Residents of Quemoy (Kinmen) |journal=Intercultural Communication Studies |date=2006 |volume=15 |number=1 |pages=136\u2013137 |accessdate=20 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429171612/http://www.uri.edu/iaics/content/2006v15n1/13%20Jian-Feng%20Wei.pdf |archivedate=29 April 2013 }}</ref>\n\n== Definitions of Taiwanese ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2011}}\n\nThe word \"'''Taiwanese people'''\" has multiple meanings and can refer to one of the following:\n\n*All citizens of the Republic of China with [[Nationality law of Taiwan|household registration]] in [[Free area of the Republic of China|the Taiwan (+ Streamlined Fujian) Free Area]]. This definition includes people living outside of [[Taiwan Province|Taiwan Province (Republic of China)]], including the peoples of the archipelagos of [[Kinmen]], [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]], and [[Wuqiu, Kinmen|Wuqiu (Kinmen)]] (and other territories controlled by the Republic of China). Many of the people living in Kinmen, Matsu, and Wuqiu are opposed to this definition, given that they view themselves as \"Chinese from Fujian Province\".<ref name=\"di Genova\"/><ref name=\"uri.edu\"/><ref>{{cite news |last=Huang |first=Sandy |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2003/04/06/201011 |title=Cases of mistaken identity perplexing Lienchiang County |newspaper=[[Taipei Times]] |date=6 April 2003 |accessdate=14 January 2009}}</ref> \n*All people living in Taiwan (or originating from Taiwan) who identify with the \"Taiwanese\" nationality in some form or another, rather than with the \"Chinese\" nationality. These people have views which are generally aligned with those of the [[Pan-Green Coalition|Pan-Green (Political) Coalition]]. This definition excludes people who support [[Chinese Unification]] and whose views are aligned with those of the [[Pan-Blue Coalition|Pan-Blue (Political) Coalition]] (which includes most of the inhabitants of Kinmen, Matsu, and Wuqiu).\n*All people living in Taiwan (of [[Han Chinese]] descent) whose ancestors endured [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|life under Japanese colonial rule (in Taiwan)]]. These people are commonly referred to as \"Taiwanese Benshengren\" within Taiwan (Republic of China), as opposed to \"Taiwanese Waishengren\" (which are [[Mainland Chinese|Chinese Mainlanders]] who migrated to Taiwan after 1945, as well as their descendants). This definition can also include the various [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples|Taiwanese Aboriginal peoples]], who are [[Austronesian peoples|ethnically-Austronesian]].\n*All people who have historically lived in Taiwan, including people of [[Japanese people|ethnic-Japanese]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], or [[Spanish people|Spanish]] descent (or various other ethnic ancestries) who historically colonized Taiwan or settled in Taiwan back when Taiwan was fully or partially controlled by the [[Empire of Japan]], the [[Dutch Empire|Empire of the Netherlands]], or the [[Spanish Empire|Empire of Spain]], respectively.\n*Only Taiwanese Aboriginal peoples, who have lived in Taiwan for up to 6000 years. This definition excludes all people groups who have settled in Taiwan in \"recent\" history (the past 1000 years), including the Han Chinese, the [[Manchu people|Manchus]], the Japanese, the Dutch, and the Spanish. This view is generally held by Chinese Mainlanders and by people living in Taiwan (Republic of China) whose views are aligned with the Pan-Blue Coalition, who do not agree with the view that the \"Taiwanese Benshengren\" should be allowed to self-identify as Taiwanese, given that they are \"invaders\" in Taiwan, rather than \"natives\".\n\n== The history of Taiwanese identity ==\nThe earliest notion of a Taiwanese [[identity politics|group identity]] emerged in the form of a [[national identity]] following the [[Qing Dynasty]]'s ceding of Taiwan to Japan in the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] in 1895 {{Harvcol|Morris|2002|pp=3\u20136}}. Prior to Japanese rule, residents of Taiwan developed relationships based on class solidarity and social connections rather than ethnic identity. Although Han often cheated Aborigines, they also married and supported one another against other residents of the same ethnic background. Taiwan was the site of frequent feuding based on ethnicity, lineage and place of origin ({{Harvcolnb|Lamley|1981}}; {{Harvcolnb|Harrell|1990}}{{fix sfn}}; {{Harvcolnb|Shepherd|1993|pp=310\u2013323}}).\n\n=== Japanese era ===\n[[File:Honto-Jin Chen Family circa 1930.JPG|thumb|225px|Taiwanese in the Japanese colonial era]]\nIn the face of the Japanese colonial hierarchy, the people of Taiwan were faced with the unequal binary relationship between [[Colony|colonizer/colonized]]. This duality between \"one\" and \"other\" was evident in the seven years of violence between the Japanese and groups of united anti-Japanese Han and Aborigines {{Harvcol|Katz|2005}}. Only later did the Japanese attempt to incorporate Taiwanese into the Japanese identity as \"loyal subjects\", but the difference between the experience of the colonized and the colonizer polarized the two groups {{Harvcol|Fujii|2006|pp=70\u201373}}.\n\nThe concept of \"[[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]\" was utilized as a tool to confirm and facilitate Japanese political policies. A system of household registers ([[koseki]]) based on the notion of race to separate and define groups of subjects. From within the group of \"non-Japanese\" the government divided Han citizens into \"Han\" and \"Hakka\" based on their perception of linguistic and cultural differences. The Japanese also maintained the Qing era classification of [[Taiwanese aborigines|aborigines]] as either \"raw\" or \"cooked\" {{Harvcol|Brown|2004|p=8}}, which to the Japanese embodied the social ramification of ethnic origin and perceived loyalty to the empire {{Harvcol|Wolf|Huang|1980|p=19}}.\n\nJapanese ultra-nationalist governor [[Shintaro Ishihara]] insulted the Taiwanese, referring to them as [[Sangokujin]]-\n\n:I referred to the \"many ''sangokujin'' who entered Japan illegally.\" I thought some people would not know that word so I paraphrased it and used ''[[gaikokujin]]'', or foreigners. But it was a newspaper holiday so the news agencies consciously picked up the sangokujin part, causing the problem.\n\n:... After World War II, when Japan lost, '''the Chinese of Taiwanese origin''' and people from the Korean Peninsula persecuted, robbed and sometimes beat up Japanese. It's at that time the word was used, so it was not derogatory. Rather we were afraid of them.\n\n:... There's no need for an apology. I was surprised that there was a big reaction to my speech. In order not to cause any misunderstanding, I decided I will no longer use that word. It is regrettable that the word was interpreted in the way it was.<ref name=\"TimeInterview\">\"[http://cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/time/magazine/2000/0424/int.ishihara.html 'There's No Need For an Apology': Tokyo's boisterous governor is back in the headlines] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408091806/http://cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/time/magazine/2000/0424/int.ishihara.html |date=2013-04-08 }},\" ''TIME Asia'', 24 April 2000.</ref>\n\n===Martial law era===\n[[File:\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u7b2c\u4e00\u4f4d\u6c11\u9078\u9996\u90fd\u5e02\u9577\u5433\u4e09\u9023\u65bc1951\u5e74\u52dd\u9078\u5f8c First People-elected Mayor of Taipei, the Capital of TAIWAN.jpg|thumb|Non-Kuomintang politician [[Wu San-lien]] (2L) celebrated his landslide victory (65.5%) in the first-time Taipei city mayoral election in January 1951 with his supporters. Taipei has been the capital of Taiwan since December 1949.]]\n\nIn 1945, the Taiwanese faced a new unequal binary relationship when Taiwan entered the political sphere of the [[Republic of China]] (ROC).{{sfnp|Peng|1972|p=45|ps=: \"One day I fell into conversation with two Americans in a jeep beside the road (in early occupied Japan), and in passing explained to them that I was not Japanese, but a Chinese from Formosa. It was something of a shock to find myself for the first time openly and proudly making this distinction\"}} Shortly following the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) arrival, however, social conflict erupted in the midst of rampant government corruption, soaring inflation and an increasing flow of immigrants from China (see [[February 28 Incident]]){{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}. The latter were preferred for jobs in the civil service as opposed to Taiwanese who were regarded as \"untrustworthy\"{{Harvcol|Phillips|2003|pp=8\u20139}}. Recurrent violent suppression of dissent also played an important role in enforcing a separate sense of \"Taiwanese-ness\" {{Harvcol|Gates|1981|pp=253\u2013275}}.\n\nUnder the KMT structure, \"Taiwanese\" became a strong \"regional\" identity. The term has often been used synonymously with '''benshengren''', a term which covered both Hokkien and Hakka whose ancestors arrived in Taiwan before the Japanese restrictions on immigration in 1895. \"Taiwanese\" was used in contrast with ''[[waishengren]]'' (mainlanders), who included the people who followed the KMT to Taiwan between 1945 and 1949 and their descendants. The government tended to stress provincial identities, with identification cards and passports issued until the late 1990s displaying one's ancestral province and county. During this period the terms \"cooked\" and \"raw\" Aborigines disappeared. The former \"raw\" Aborigines were termed ''Shandi Tongbao'', ''Gaoshanzu'' (Mountain Race) or ''Gaoshan Tongbao'' (Mountain Compatriots).\n\n=== Democratic era ===\n[[File:President Lee teng hui.png|thumb|right|180px|[[Lee Teng-hui]] became the first president of the Republic of China to be born in Taiwan. He was democratically elected in 1996.]]\n\nWith Taiwan's political liberalization in the 1970s and 1980s, encouraged by Taiwan's changing international status, the concept of a \"Taiwanese people\" became politicized by opponents of the KMT. The [[tangwai movement]] deployed concepts of \"Taiwanese identity\" against the authoritarian KMT government, often using extreme tactics to build a short-term ethno-centric opposition to the KMT {{Harvcol|Edmunson|2002|pp=34\u201342}}{{fix sfn|date=November 2010}}. The campaign saw resonance with the people of Taiwan and the term \"Taiwanese\" has been used by politicians of all parties to refer to the electorate in an effort to secure votes. The concept of a separate Taiwanese identity has become such an integral factor to the election culture in Taiwan, that identifying as a Taiwanese has become essential to being elected in Taiwan {{Harvcol|Corcuff|2002|pp=243\u2013249}}.\n\n=== New Taiwanese ===\nThe term \"New Taiwanese\" (\u65b0\u81fa\u7063\u4eba) was coined by former [[President of the Republic of China]], [[Lee Teng-hui]] in 1995 to bridge the ethnic cleavage that followed the [[February 28 Incident]] of 1947 and characterized the frigid relations between ''waishengren'' and ''benshengren'' during forty years of [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]]. Although originally aimed at the successive generations of Taiwanese with mainlander ancestry, it has been further articulated by Lee and other political and social leaders to refer to any person who loves Taiwan and is committed to calling Taiwan home. Although critics have called the \"New Taiwanese Concept\" a political ploy to win votes from ''benshengren'' who regarded the KMT as an alien regime, it has remained an important factor in the dialectic between ethnic identities in Taiwan. Despite being adopted early on by former Provincial Governor [[James Soong]] (1997) and later by, then Taipei mayoral candidate [[Ma Ying-jeou]] (1999), the term has since been dropped from contemporary political rhetoric {{Harvcol|Corcuff|2002|pp=186\u2013188}}.\n\n=== Multicultural present ===\nIn contemporary Taiwan the phenomenon of mixed marriages between couples comprising different ethnic groups has grown to include people from the Indian subcontinent{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}, southeast Asia, Europe{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}, the Americas and the [[Pacific Islands]]. The increasing number of marriages between Taiwanese and other countries creates a problem for the rigid definitions of ethnic identity used by both the ROC and the PRC when discussing Taiwan {{Harvcol|Harrell|1995}}. In one-fourth of all marriages in Taiwan today, one partner will be from another country<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cicred.org/Eng/Seminars/Details/Seminars/FDA/PAPERS/24_WenShanYang.pdf|title=Gender Imbalances and the Twisted Marriage Market in Taiwan|website=Cicred.org}}</ref> and one out of every twelve children is born to a family of mixed parentage. As Taiwan's birthrate is among the lowest in the world, this contingent is playing an increasingly important role in changing Taiwan's demographic makeup.

This has been cited as evidence that the concept of Taiwanese identity is not the product of local political manipulation, but an actual phenomenon of ethnic and sociopolitical identities ({{Harvcolnb|Corcuff| 2002| pp=137\u2013149, 207}}; {{Harvcolnb|Hsiau|2005|pp=157\u2013170}}).\n\n== Major socio-cultural subgroups ==\nAccording to governmental statistics, over 95% of Taiwan's 23.4 million people are [[Han Chinese]],{{sfnp|Exec. Yuan|2014|p=36}} of which the majority includes descendants of early [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] immigrants who arrived from [[Fujian]] in large numbers starting in the 17th century.{{sfnp|Exec.

The Hakkas emigrated chiefly from eastern [[Guangdong]], speak [[Hakka Chinese]], and originally took up residence in hilly areas.{{sfnp|Exec. Yuan|2014|p=48}} The so-called \"[[mainland Chinese]]\" Han subgroup includes and descends from the 2 million Nationalists who fled to Taiwan following the communist victory in mainland China in 1949. The non-Han Austronesian population of [[Taiwanese aborigines]] comprises about 2.3% of the population and have inhabited the island for millennia.{{sfnp|Exec. Yuan|2014|p=49}}\n\nMigration to Taiwan from southern Asia began approximately 12,000 BC, but large-scale migration to Taiwan did not occur until the 18th to the beginning of the 20th century as a result of political and economic chaos in mainland China.{{sfnp|Shepherd|1993}}{{sfnp|Bellwood|2000}}{{sfnp|Blust|1988}} The first large scale migration occurred as a result of the [[Manchu]] invasion and conquest of China, overthrowing the [[Ming dynasty]] and establishing the [[Qing dynasty]], which was established in 1644 and remained until 1911.\n\nIn 1624, the [[Dutch East India Company]] established an outpost in modern-day [[Anping, Tainan]] in southern Taiwan after expelling the Spanish. The Dutch soon realized Taiwan's potential as a colony for trading deer hide, [[venison]], rice, and sugar. However, Aborigines were not interested in developing the land and transporting settlers from Europe would be too costly. Due to the resulting labor shortage, the Dutch hired Han farmers from across the [[Taiwan Strait]] who fled the Manchu invasion of Ming dynasty China.{{sfnp|Andrade|2006}}\n\n[[Koxinga]] brought along many more Chinese settlers during the [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia]] in which he expelled the Dutch. Migration of male laborers from [[Fujian]], steadily increased into the 18th and 19th century. In time, this migration and the gradual removal of ethnic markers (coupled with the acculturation, intermarriage and assimilation of [[Taiwanese Plains Aborigines|plains Aborigines]] with the Han) resulted in the widespread adoption of Han patterns of behavior making Taiwanese Han the ethnic majority.\n\nIt was not until the Japanese arrival in 1895 that Taiwanese first developed a collective Taiwanese identity in contrast to that of the colonizing Japanese.{{sfnp|Morris|2002|}} When the [[Chinese Civil War]] broke out between [[Kuomintang|Kuomintang nationalists]] and the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese communists]] in 1945, there was another mass migration of people from mainland China to Taiwan fleeing the communists. These migrants are known as the [[mainland Chinese]].\n\n=== Aborigines ===\n{{Main|Taiwanese indigenous peoples}}\n[[File:Taiwan aborigine lona children.jpg|thumb|A group of Taiwanese aborigines]]\nTaiwanese aborigines are the [[indigenous people]]s of [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]]. They speak languages that belongs to the [[Austronesian language family]], and are culturally, [[genetically]] and [[linguistically]] closely related to the ethnic groups of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] and [[Oceania]]. Their ancestors are believed to have been living on the islands for approximately 8,000 years before major [[Han Chinese]] [[immigration]] began in the 17th century {{Harvcol|Blust|1999}}. Taiwan's Austronesian speakers were traditionally distributed over much of the island's rugged central mountain range and concentrated in villages along the alluvial plains. Today, the bulk of the contemporary Taiwanese aborigine population reside in the mountains and the major cities. The total population of recognized aborigines on Taiwan is approximately 533,600, or approximately 2.28% of Taiwan's population.{{sfnp|Exec. Yuan|2014|p=49}} The cities of [[Yilan City|Yilan]], [[Hualien City|Hualien]], and [[Taitung City|Taitung]] are known for their aboriginal communities. In the 1990s several groups of recognized indigenous peoples, which had traditionally viewed themselves as separate, united under the singular ethnonym '{{lang|zh|\u539f\u4f4f\u6c11}}' or 'Aborigines' {{Harvcol|Stainton|1999}}.\n\n=== Hoklo ===\n{{Main|Hoklo Taiwanese}}\n{{See also|Han Taiwanese|Hoklo people}}\n\nThe [[Hoklo people]] of [[Taiwan]] and [[Penghu]] speak [[Hokkien]] and mostly originated from Fujian (specifically [[Quanzhou]], [[Zhangzhou]], [[Xiamen]] and [[Kinmen]]). The Hoklos account for about 70% of the total population today. During [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Qing rule]], some Hoklo men took [[Taiwanese aborigines|aboriginal]] brides.{{sfnp|Exec.

Among the Hoklo, the common idiom, \"has [[Names of China#Tang|Tangshan]] father, no Tangshan mother\" ({{zh|t=\u6709{{linktext|\u5510\u5c71}}\u516c\u3001\u7121\u5510\u5c71\u5abd|poj=\u016a Tn\u0302g-soa\u207f kong, b\u00f4 Tn\u0302g-soa\u207f m\u00e1}})<ref>{{cite book |last=Tai |first=Pao-tsun |title=The Concise History of Taiwan |edition=Chinese-English bilingual |year=2007 |publisher=Taiwan Historica |location=Nantou City |isbn=9789860109504 |page=52}}</ref><ref>{{holodict|60161}}</ref> refers how the Han people crossing the Taiwan Strait were mostly male, whereas their offspring would be through marriage with female Taiwanese aborigines.\n\nWithin the Taiwanese Han Hoklo community itself, differences in culture indicate the degree to which mixture with aboriginals took place, with most pure Hoklo Han in Northern Taiwan having almost no Aboriginal admixture, which is limited to Hoklo Han in Southern Taiwan.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-m0PGuSUGDMC&pg=PA157#v=onepage&q&f=false Brown 2004]. pp. 156-7.</ref> Plains aboriginals who were mixed and assimilated into the Hoklo Han population at different stages were differentiated by the historian Melissa J.

[[Taiwan]].</ref>\n\nThe Taiwanese [[Hakka people|Hakka]] communities, although arriving to Taiwan from mountains of eastern [[Guangdong]] and western [[Fujian]], have also likely mixed through intermarriage with lowland Aborigines as well. Hakka family trees are known for identifying the male ancestors by their ethnic Hakka heritage while leaving out information on the identity of the female ancestors. Also, during the process of intermarriage and assimilation, many of the lowland Aborigines and their families adopted [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] and Hakka family names. Much of this happened in Taiwan prior to the Japanese colonization of Taiwan, so that by the time of the Japanese colonization, most of the population that the Japanese classified as \"Chinese\" [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] and \"Chinese\" Hakka were in truth already of mixed ancestry. Physical features of both Taiwanese aborigine and Chinese can be found amongst the Taiwanese mainstream today.\n\nIt is commonly disputed that Taiwanese are not Chinese despite common or similar societal beliefs. DNA studies have shown mixed results of both Chinese ancestors and Taiwanese Aborigines. This finding would support both views, which does not clear the air any more than it had been already. {{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n=== Mainlander ===\n{{See also|Han Taiwanese}}\n\"Mainlanders\" or \"Waisheng Ren\" are used by some to refer to the [[post-war]] immigrants (and sometimes also their descendants) who followed the KMT to Taiwan between 1945 and 1950. The descendants of [[Mainlander (China)|mainlanders]] settled first within the heart of large urban centers in Taiwan such as Taipei, Taichung, or Kaohsiung{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}. High numbers of government officials and civil servants who followed the KMT to Taiwan and occupied the positions of the colonial government moved into the official dormitories and residences built by the Japanese for civil servants. The ghettoization of mainlander communities exacerbated the divisions imagined by non-mainlander groups, and stymied cultural integration and assimilation into mainstream Taiwanese culture {{Harvcol|Gates|1981}}. Nationalization campaigns undertaken by the KMT established an official \"culture\", which reflected the KMT government's own preference for what it considered authentic Chinese culture. This excluded many of the local Taiwanese practices and local cultures, including the diverse cultures brought to Taiwan by the mainlanders from all parts of China {{Harvcol|Wachman|1994}}. Unlike, the [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] and [[Hakka people|Hakka]] of Taiwan, who felt excluded by the new government, the [[Mainland Chinese|mainlanders]] and their families supported the nationalists and embraced the official \"culture\" as their own, with \"national culture\" being taught in school {{Harvcol|Wilson|1970}}. The mainlanders used their embrace of Nationalist culture to identify themselves as the authentic Chinese people of Taiwan.\n\nIn addition to the Han people, there were also small numbers of [[Mongolians in Taiwan|Mongols]], [[Islam in Taiwan|Hui]], [[Manchu people in Taiwan|Manchu]] and other [[ethnic groups in China|ethnic minorities]] among the Waishengren.\n\n===Burmese Chinese===\nBurmese Chinese have settled mostly in [[Zhonghe District]], located in [[Taipei County]].

The [[human leukocyte antigen]] typing study and [[mitochondrial DNA]] analysis performed in recent years show that more than 88% of the Taiwanese population have some degree of aboriginal origin {{Harvcol|Sim|2003}}.\n\nA 2009 doctoral dissertation questions such findings and claims that \"the great number of Han immigrants after the 18th century is the main reason to consider that the early genetic contribution from Plains Indigenes to Taiwanese Han has been largely diluted and no longer exists in any meaningful way.\"<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Chen|first=Shu-Juo |title=How Han are Taiwanese Han?

group who share a common [[Culture of Taiwan|Taiwanese culture]] and speak [[languages of Taiwan|Mandarin Chinese, Hokkien, Hakka, or Formosan Aboriginal languages]] as a mother tongue. Taiwanese people may also refer to individuals who either claim or are imputed [[cultural identity]] focused on Taiwan or areas under the control of the [[Government of the Republic of China]] since 1945, including [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]], and [[Matsu islands]] (see [[Free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan Area]]). At least three competing (occasionally overlapping) paradigms are used to identify someone as a Taiwanese person: nationalist criteria, [[self-identification]] (including the concept of \"New Taiwanese\") criteria, and socio-cultural criteria. These standards are fluid, and result from evolving social and political issues. The complexity resulting from competing and evolving standards is compounded by a larger dispute regarding Taiwan's identity, the [[political status of Taiwan]], and its potential ''[[de jure]]'' [[Taiwan independence]] or [[Cross-Strait Unification]].\n\nAccording to government figures, over 95% of Taiwan's population of 23.7 million consists of [[Han Chinese]], while 5% are [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] [[Formosan aborigines]]. The category of Han Chinese consists of the three main groups: [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]], [[Hakka people|Hakka]], and [[mainland Chinese]].{{sfnp|Copper|2003|pp=12-13}}{{sfnp|Hsiau|2005|p=105}} However, acculturation, intermarriage and assimilation have resulted in some degree of mixing of the Han and Formosan(Taiwanese) Aborigine blood lines. Although the concept of the \"four great ethnic groups\" was alleged to be the deliberate attempt by the Hoklo-dominated [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) to defuse ethnic tensions, this conception has become a dominant frame of reference for dealing with Taiwanese ethnic and national issues.{{sfnp|Makeham|2005|pp=4-5}}\n\nDespite the wide use of the \"four great ethnic groups\" in public discourse as essentialized identities, the relationships between the peoples of Taiwan have been in a constant state of convergence and negotiation for centuries. The continuing process of cross-ethnic mixing with ethnicities from within and outside Taiwan, combined with the disappearance of ethnic barriers due to a shared socio-political experience, has led to the emergence of \"Taiwanese\" as a larger [[ethnic group]],{{sfnp|Harrell|Huang|1994|pp=14\u201315}} except on the island of Kinmen whose populace consider themselves as [[Kinmen]]ese or [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], and as well as inhabitant of [[Matsu Islands]] whereby they also consider themselves as Matsunese or Chinese.<ref name=\"di Genova\">{{cite news |last=di Genova |first=Trista |date=11 July 2007 |url = http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/114701.htm |title=Study explores the 'Kinmen Identity' |newspaper=China Post |accessdate=20 January 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"uri.edu\">{{cite journal |last=Wei |first=Jian-Feng |url=http://www.uri.edu/iaics/content/2006v15n1/13%20Jian-Feng%20Wei.pdf |title=An Examination of Cultural Identity of Residents of Quemoy (Kinmen) |journal=Intercultural Communication Studies |date=2006 |volume=15 |number=1 |pages=136\u2013137 |accessdate=20 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429171612/http://www.uri.edu/iaics/content/2006v15n1/13%20Jian-Feng%20Wei.pdf |archivedate=29 April 2013 }}</ref>\n\n== Definitions of Taiwanese ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2011}}\n\nThe word \"'''Taiwanese people'''\" has multiple meanings and can refer to one of the following:\n\n*All citizens of the Republic of China with [[Nationality law of Taiwan|household registration]] in [[Free area of the Republic of China|the Taiwan (+ Streamlined Fujian) Free Area]]. This definition includes people living outside of [[Taiwan Province|Taiwan Province (Republic of China)]], including the peoples of the archipelagos of [[Kinmen]], [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]], and [[Wuqiu, Kinmen|Wuqiu (Kinmen)]] (and other territories controlled by the Republic of China). Many of the people living in Kinmen, Matsu, and Wuqiu are opposed to this definition, given that they view themselves as \"Chinese from Fujian Province\".<ref name=\"di Genova\"/><ref name=\"uri.edu\"/><ref>{{cite news |last=Huang |first=Sandy |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2003/04/06/201011 |title=Cases of mistaken identity perplexing Lienchiang County |newspaper=[[Taipei Times]] |date=6 April 2003 |accessdate=14 January 2009}}</ref> \n*All people living in Taiwan (or originating from Taiwan) who identify with the \"Taiwanese\" nationality in some form or another, rather than with the \"Chinese\" nationality. These people have views which are generally aligned with those of the [[Pan-Green Coalition|Pan-Green (Political) Coalition]]. This definition excludes people who support [[Chinese Unification]] and whose views are aligned with those of the [[Pan-Blue Coalition|Pan-Blue (Political) Coalition]] (which includes most of the inhabitants of Kinmen, Matsu, and Wuqiu).\n*All people living in Taiwan (of [[Han Chinese]] descent) whose ancestors endured [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|life under Japanese colonial rule (in Taiwan)]]. These people are commonly referred to as \"Taiwanese Benshengren\" within Taiwan (Republic of China), as opposed to \"Taiwanese Waishengren\" (which are [[Mainland Chinese|Chinese Mainlanders]] who migrated to Taiwan after 1945, as well as their descendants). This definition can also include the various [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples|Taiwanese Aboriginal peoples]], who are [[Austronesian peoples|ethnically-Austronesian]].\n*All people who have historically lived in Taiwan, including people of [[Japanese people|ethnic-Japanese]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], or [[Spanish people|Spanish]] descent (or various other ethnic ancestries) who historically colonized Taiwan or settled in Taiwan back when Taiwan was fully or partially controlled by the [[Empire of Japan]], the [[Dutch Empire|Empire of the Netherlands]], or the [[Spanish Empire|Empire of Spain]], respectively.\n*Only Taiwanese Aboriginal peoples, who have lived in Taiwan for up to 6000 years. This definition excludes all people groups who have settled in Taiwan in \"recent\" history (the past 1000 years), including the Han Chinese, the [[Manchu people|Manchus]], the Japanese, the Dutch, and the Spanish. This view is generally held by Chinese Mainlanders and by people living in Taiwan (Republic of China) whose views are aligned with the Pan-Blue Coalition, who do not agree with the view that the \"Taiwanese Benshengren\" should be allowed to self-identify as Taiwanese, given that they are \"invaders\" in Taiwan, rather than \"natives\".\n\n== The history of Taiwanese identity ==\nThe earliest notion of a Taiwanese [[identity politics|group identity]] emerged in the form of a [[national identity]] following the [[Qing Dynasty]]'s ceding of Taiwan to Japan in the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] in 1895 {{Harvcol|Morris|2002|pp=3\u20136}}. Prior to Japanese rule, residents of Taiwan developed relationships based on class solidarity and social connections rather than ethnic identity. Although Han often cheated Aborigines, they also married and supported one another against other residents of the same ethnic background. Taiwan was the site of frequent feuding based on ethnicity, lineage and place of origin ({{Harvcolnb|Lamley|1981}}; {{Harvcolnb|Harrell|1990}}{{fix sfn}}; {{Harvcolnb|Shepherd|1993|pp=310\u2013323}}).\n\n=== Japanese era ===\n[[File:Honto-Jin Chen Family circa 1930.JPG|thumb|225px|Taiwanese in the Japanese colonial era]]\nIn the face of the Japanese colonial hierarchy, the people of Taiwan were faced with the unequal binary relationship between [[Colony|colonizer/colonized]]. This duality between \"one\" and \"other\" was evident in the seven years of violence between the Japanese and groups of united anti-Japanese Han and Aborigines {{Harvcol|Katz|2005}}. Only later did the Japanese attempt to incorporate Taiwanese into the Japanese identity as \"loyal subjects\", but the difference between the experience of the colonized and the colonizer polarized the two groups {{Harvcol|Fujii|2006|pp=70\u201373}}.\n\nThe concept of \"[[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]\" was utilized as a tool to confirm and facilitate Japanese political policies. A system of household registers ([[koseki]]) based on the notion of race to separate and define groups of subjects. From within the group of \"non-Japanese\" the government divided Han citizens into \"Han\" and \"Hakka\" based on their perception of linguistic and cultural differences. The Japanese also maintained the Qing era classification of [[Taiwanese aborigines|aborigines]] as either \"raw\" or \"cooked\" {{Harvcol|Brown|2004|p=8}}, which to the Japanese embodied the social ramification of ethnic origin and perceived loyalty to the empire {{Harvcol|Wolf|Huang|1980|p=19}}.\n\nJapanese ultra-nationalist governor [[Shintaro Ishihara]] insulted the Taiwanese, referring to them as [[Sangokujin]]-\n\n:I referred to the \"many ''sangokujin'' who entered Japan illegally.\" I thought some people would not know that word so I paraphrased it and used ''[[gaikokujin]]'', or foreigners. But it was a newspaper holiday so the news agencies consciously picked up the sangokujin part, causing the problem.\n\n:... After World War II, when Japan lost, '''the Chinese of Taiwanese origin''' and people from the Korean Peninsula persecuted, robbed and sometimes beat up Japanese. It's at that time the word was used, so it was not derogatory. Rather we were afraid of them.\n\n:... There's no need for an apology. I was surprised that there was a big reaction to my speech. In order not to cause any misunderstanding, I decided I will no longer use that word. It is regrettable that the word was interpreted in the way it was.<ref name=\"TimeInterview\">\"[http://cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/time/magazine/2000/0424/int.ishihara.html 'There's No Need For an Apology': Tokyo's boisterous governor is back in the headlines] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408091806/http://cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/time/magazine/2000/0424/int.ishihara.html |date=2013-04-08 }},\" ''TIME Asia'', 24 April 2000.</ref>\n\n===Martial law era===\n[[File:\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u7b2c\u4e00\u4f4d\u6c11\u9078\u9996\u90fd\u5e02\u9577\u5433\u4e09\u9023\u65bc1951\u5e74\u52dd\u9078\u5f8c First People-elected Mayor of Taipei, the Capital of TAIWAN.jpg|thumb|Non-Kuomintang politician [[Wu San-lien]] (2L) celebrated his landslide victory (65.5%) in the first-time Taipei city mayoral election in January 1951 with his supporters. Taipei has been the capital of Taiwan since December 1949.]]\n\nIn 1945, the Taiwanese faced a new unequal binary relationship when Taiwan entered the political sphere of the [[Republic of China]] (ROC).{{sfnp|Peng|1972|p=45|ps=: \"One day I fell into conversation with two Americans in a jeep beside the road (in early occupied Japan), and in passing explained to them that I was not Japanese, but a Chinese from Formosa. It was something of a shock to find myself for the first time openly and proudly making this distinction\"}} Shortly following the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) arrival, however, social conflict erupted in the midst of rampant government corruption, soaring inflation and an increasing flow of immigrants from China (see [[February 28 Incident]]){{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}. The latter were preferred for jobs in the civil service as opposed to Taiwanese who were regarded as \"untrustworthy\"{{Harvcol|Phillips|2003|pp=8\u20139}}. Recurrent violent suppression of dissent also played an important role in enforcing a separate sense of \"Taiwanese-ness\" {{Harvcol|Gates|1981|pp=253\u2013275}}.\n\nUnder the KMT structure, \"Taiwanese\" became a strong \"regional\" identity. The term has often been used synonymously with '''benshengren''', a term which covered both Hokkien and Hakka whose ancestors arrived in Taiwan before the Japanese restrictions on immigration in 1895. \"Taiwanese\" was used in contrast with ''[[waishengren]]'' (mainlanders), who included the people who followed the KMT to Taiwan between 1945 and 1949 and their descendants. The government tended to stress provincial identities, with identification cards and passports issued until the late 1990s displaying one's ancestral province and county. During this period the terms \"cooked\" and \"raw\" Aborigines disappeared. The former \"raw\" Aborigines were termed ''Shandi Tongbao'', ''Gaoshanzu'' (Mountain Race) or ''Gaoshan Tongbao'' (Mountain Compatriots).\n\n=== Democratic era ===\n[[File:President Lee teng hui.png|thumb|right|180px|[[Lee Teng-hui]] became the first president of the Republic of China to be born in Taiwan. He was democratically elected in 1996.]]\n\nWith Taiwan's political liberalization in the 1970s and 1980s, encouraged by Taiwan's changing international status, the concept of a \"Taiwanese people\" became politicized by opponents of the KMT. The [[tangwai movement]] deployed concepts of \"Taiwanese identity\" against the authoritarian KMT government, often using extreme tactics to build a short-term ethno-centric opposition to the KMT {{Harvcol|Edmunson|2002|pp=34\u201342}}{{fix sfn|date=November 2010}}. The campaign saw resonance with the people of Taiwan and the term \"Taiwanese\" has been used by politicians of all parties to refer to the electorate in an effort to secure votes. The concept of a separate Taiwanese identity has become such an integral factor to the election culture in Taiwan, that identifying as a Taiwanese has become essential to being elected in Taiwan {{Harvcol|Corcuff|2002|pp=243\u2013249}}.\n\n=== New Taiwanese ===\nThe term \"New Taiwanese\" (\u65b0\u81fa\u7063\u4eba) was coined by former [[President of the Republic of China]], [[Lee Teng-hui]] in 1995 to bridge the ethnic cleavage that followed the [[February 28 Incident]] of 1947 and characterized the frigid relations between ''waishengren'' and ''benshengren'' during forty years of [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]]. Although originally aimed at the successive generations of Taiwanese with mainlander ancestry, it has been further articulated by Lee and other political and social leaders to refer to any person who loves Taiwan and is committed to calling Taiwan home. Although critics have called the \"New Taiwanese Concept\" a political ploy to win votes from ''benshengren'' who regarded the KMT as an alien regime, it has remained an important factor in the dialectic between ethnic identities in Taiwan. Despite being adopted early on by former Provincial Governor [[James Soong]] (1997) and later by, then Taipei mayoral candidate [[Ma Ying-jeou]] (1999), the term has since been dropped from contemporary political rhetoric {{Harvcol|Corcuff|2002|pp=186\u2013188}}.\n\n=== Multicultural present ===\nIn contemporary Taiwan the phenomenon of mixed marriages between couples comprising different ethnic groups has grown to include people from the Indian subcontinent{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}, southeast Asia, Europe{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}, the Americas and the [[Pacific Islands]]. The increasing number of marriages between Taiwanese and other countries creates a problem for the rigid definitions of ethnic identity used by both the ROC and the PRC when discussing Taiwan {{Harvcol|Harrell|1995}}. In one-fourth of all marriages in Taiwan today, one partner will be from another country<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cicred.org/Eng/Seminars/Details/Seminars/FDA/PAPERS/24_WenShanYang.pdf|title=Gender Imbalances and the Twisted Marriage Market in Taiwan|website=Cicred.org}}</ref> and one out of every twelve children is born to a family of mixed parentage. As Taiwan's birthrate is among the lowest in the world, this contingent is playing an increasingly important role in changing Taiwan's demographic makeup. By 2010, this social-cultural group of people is typically known as \"'''Taiwan's new resident''' (\u81fa\u7063\u65b0\u4f4f\u6c11 ''lit.'' \"New Residents in Taiwan\" {{zh|w=Taiwan Hsin Chu-min|p=X\u012bnzh\u00f9m\u00edn|first=w}}; {{IPA|[\u0255in \u0288\u0361\u0282u min]}}).\n\n== The current situation of Taiwanese identity ==\n[[File:Taiwan ROC Passport.jpg|thumb|A passport issued by the Republic of China, with the word \u201cTaiwan\u201d in Latin script on the cover, but without the corresponding [[Han character]]s.]]\n{{Main|Sinocentrism|Sinicization|De-Sinicization|Taiwanization|Taiwanese nationalism|Taiwan independence}}\nIn a 2002 poll by the [[Democratic Progressive Party]], over 50% of the respondents considered themselves \"Taiwanese\" only, up from less than 20% in 1991 {{Harvcol|Dreyer|2003}}.

This has been cited as evidence that the concept of Taiwanese identity is not the product of local political manipulation, but an actual phenomenon of ethnic and sociopolitical identities ({{Harvcolnb|Corcuff| 2002| pp=137\u2013149, 207}}; {{Harvcolnb|Hsiau|2005|pp=157\u2013170}}).\n\n== Major socio-cultural subgroups ==\nAccording to governmental statistics, over 95% of Taiwan's 23.4 million people are [[Han Chinese]],{{sfnp|Exec. Yuan|2014|p=36}} of which the majority includes descendants of early [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] immigrants who arrived from [[Fujian]] in large numbers starting in the 17th century.{{sfnp|Exec. Yuan|2014|p=47-8}} A significant minority of the Han group are the [[Hakka people]], who comprise about 15% of the total population. The Hakkas emigrated chiefly from eastern [[Guangdong]], speak [[Hakka Chinese]], and originally took up residence in hilly areas.{{sfnp|Exec. Yuan|2014|p=48}} The so-called \"[[mainland Chinese]]\" Han subgroup includes and descends from the 2 million Nationalists who fled to Taiwan following the communist victory in mainland China in 1949. The non-Han Austronesian population of [[Taiwanese aborigines]] comprises about 2.3% of the population and have inhabited the island for millennia.{{sfnp|Exec. Yuan|2014|p=49}}\n\nMigration to Taiwan from southern Asia began approximately 12,000 BC, but large-scale migration to Taiwan did not occur until the 18th to the beginning of the 20th century as a result of political and economic chaos in mainland China.{{sfnp|Shepherd|1993}}{{sfnp|Bellwood|2000}}{{sfnp|Blust|1988}} The first large scale migration occurred as a result of the [[Manchu]] invasion and conquest of China, overthrowing the [[Ming dynasty]] and establishing the [[Qing dynasty]], which was established in 1644 and remained until 1911.\n\nIn 1624, the [[Dutch East India Company]] established an outpost in modern-day [[Anping, Tainan]] in southern Taiwan after expelling the Spanish. The Dutch soon realized Taiwan's potential as a colony for trading deer hide, [[venison]], rice, and sugar. However, Aborigines were not interested in developing the land and transporting settlers from Europe would be too costly. Due to the resulting labor shortage, the Dutch hired Han farmers from across the [[Taiwan Strait]] who fled the Manchu invasion of Ming dynasty China.{{sfnp|Andrade|2006}}\n\n[[Koxinga]] brought along many more Chinese settlers during the [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia]] in which he expelled the Dutch. Migration of male laborers from [[Fujian]], steadily increased into the 18th and 19th century. In time, this migration and the gradual removal of ethnic markers (coupled with the acculturation, intermarriage and assimilation of [[Taiwanese Plains Aborigines|plains Aborigines]] with the Han) resulted in the widespread adoption of Han patterns of behavior making Taiwanese Han the ethnic majority.\n\nIt was not until the Japanese arrival in 1895 that Taiwanese first developed a collective Taiwanese identity in contrast to that of the colonizing Japanese.{{sfnp|Morris|2002|}} When the [[Chinese Civil War]] broke out between [[Kuomintang|Kuomintang nationalists]] and the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese communists]] in 1945, there was another mass migration of people from mainland China to Taiwan fleeing the communists. These migrants are known as the [[mainland Chinese]].\n\n=== Aborigines ===\n{{Main|Taiwanese indigenous peoples}}\n[[File:Taiwan aborigine lona children.jpg|thumb|A group of Taiwanese aborigines]]\nTaiwanese aborigines are the [[indigenous people]]s of [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]]. They speak languages that belongs to the [[Austronesian language family]], and are culturally, [[genetically]] and [[linguistically]] closely related to the ethnic groups of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] and [[Oceania]]. Their ancestors are believed to have been living on the islands for approximately 8,000 years before major [[Han Chinese]] [[immigration]] began in the 17th century {{Harvcol|Blust|1999}}. Taiwan's Austronesian speakers were traditionally distributed over much of the island's rugged central mountain range and concentrated in villages along the alluvial plains. Today, the bulk of the contemporary Taiwanese aborigine population reside in the mountains and the major cities. The total population of recognized aborigines on Taiwan is approximately 533,600, or approximately 2.28% of Taiwan's population.{{sfnp|Exec. Yuan|2014|p=49}} The cities of [[Yilan City|Yilan]], [[Hualien City|Hualien]], and [[Taitung City|Taitung]] are known for their aboriginal communities. In the 1990s several groups of recognized indigenous peoples, which had traditionally viewed themselves as separate, united under the singular ethnonym '{{lang|zh|\u539f\u4f4f\u6c11}}' or 'Aborigines' {{Harvcol|Stainton|1999}}.\n\n=== Hoklo ===\n{{Main|Hoklo Taiwanese}}\n{{See also|Han Taiwanese|Hoklo people}}\n\nThe [[Hoklo people]] of [[Taiwan]] and [[Penghu]] speak [[Hokkien]] and mostly originated from Fujian (specifically [[Quanzhou]], [[Zhangzhou]], [[Xiamen]] and [[Kinmen]]).

[[Taiwan]].</ref>\n\nThe Taiwanese [[Hakka people|Hakka]] communities, although arriving to Taiwan from mountains of eastern [[Guangdong]] and western [[Fujian]], have also likely mixed through intermarriage with lowland Aborigines as well. Hakka family trees are known for identifying the male ancestors by their ethnic Hakka heritage while leaving out information on the identity of the female ancestors. Also, during the process of intermarriage and assimilation, many of the lowland Aborigines and their families adopted [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] and Hakka family names. Much of this happened in Taiwan prior to the Japanese colonization of Taiwan, so that by the time of the Japanese colonization, most of the population that the Japanese classified as \"Chinese\" [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] and \"Chinese\" Hakka were in truth already of mixed ancestry. Physical features of both Taiwanese aborigine and Chinese can be found amongst the Taiwanese mainstream today.\n\nIt is commonly disputed that Taiwanese are not Chinese despite common or similar societal beliefs. DNA studies have shown mixed results of both Chinese ancestors and Taiwanese Aborigines. This finding would support both views, which does not clear the air any more than it had been already. {{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n=== Mainlander ===\n{{See also|Han Taiwanese}}\n\"Mainlanders\" or \"Waisheng Ren\" are used by some to refer to the [[post-war]] immigrants (and sometimes also their descendants) who followed the KMT to Taiwan between 1945 and 1950. The descendants of [[Mainlander (China)|mainlanders]] settled first within the heart of large urban centers in Taiwan such as Taipei, Taichung, or Kaohsiung{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}. High numbers of government officials and civil servants who followed the KMT to Taiwan and occupied the positions of the colonial government moved into the official dormitories and residences built by the Japanese for civil servants. The ghettoization of mainlander communities exacerbated the divisions imagined by non-mainlander groups, and stymied cultural integration and assimilation into mainstream Taiwanese culture {{Harvcol|Gates|1981}}. Nationalization campaigns undertaken by the KMT established an official \"culture\", which reflected the KMT government's own preference for what it considered authentic Chinese culture. This excluded many of the local Taiwanese practices and local cultures, including the diverse cultures brought to Taiwan by the mainlanders from all parts of China {{Harvcol|Wachman|1994}}. Unlike, the [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] and [[Hakka people|Hakka]] of Taiwan, who felt excluded by the new government, the [[Mainland Chinese|mainlanders]] and their families supported the nationalists and embraced the official \"culture\" as their own, with \"national culture\" being taught in school {{Harvcol|Wilson|1970}}. The mainlanders used their embrace of Nationalist culture to identify themselves as the authentic Chinese people of Taiwan.\n\nIn addition to the Han people, there were also small numbers of [[Mongolians in Taiwan|Mongols]], [[Islam in Taiwan|Hui]], [[Manchu people in Taiwan|Manchu]] and other [[ethnic groups in China|ethnic minorities]] among the Waishengren.\n\n===Burmese Chinese===\nBurmese Chinese have settled mostly in [[Zhonghe District]], located in [[Taipei County]].

Taiwanese people (of Chinese descent) have traveled between China and Taiwan throughout history. [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples|Taiwanese Aborigines]] also have a minor presence in China (PRC). After the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] was signed, with Taiwan (previously a Chinese province/prefecture) being ceded by [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]] to the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]], an [[expatriate]]/[[refugee]] community of Taiwanese in China was created.\n\nThe original [[Taiwanese Communist Party]] was closely affiliated with the [[Chinese Communist Party|Chinese Communist Party (CCP)]] prior to the establishment of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949. The failed party would later evolve into the [[Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League]], one of eight officially-recognised political parties within China (PRC) which is ultimately subservient to the CCP.

{"title_page": "Maharashtrian cuisine", "text_new": "{{Indian cuisine}}\n\n'''Maharashtrian''' or '''Marathi''' '''cuisine''' is the [[cuisine]] of the [[Marathi people]] from the Indian state of [[Maharashtra]]. It has distinctive attributes, while sharing much with other [[Indian cuisine]]<nowiki/>s. Traditionally, Maharashtrians have considered their food to be more austere than others.\n\nMaharashtrian cuisine includes mild and spicy dishes. [[Wheat]], [[rice]], ''[[jowar]]'', ''[[bajri]]'', [[vegetable]]s, [[lentil]]s and [[fruit]] are dietary [[Staple food|staples]]. [[Peanut]]s and [[cashew]]s are often served with vegetables. [[Meat]] was traditionally used sparsely or only by the well off until recently, because of economic conditions and culture.\n\nThe urban population in metropolitan cities such as [[Mumbai]], [[Pune]] and others has been influenced by cuisine from other parts of India and abroad. For example, the [[Udupi]] dishes ''[[idli]]'' and ''[[dosa]],'' as well as Chinese and Western dishes, are quite popular in home cooking, and in restaurants.\n\nDistinctly Maharashtrian dishes include ''ukdiche [[modak]]'', aluchi patal bhaji and [[Thalipeeth]].\n\n{{TOCLimit|3}}\n\n== Regular meals and staple dishes ==\n[[File:Maharashtra Districts.png|thumb|300px|Regions and districts of Maharashtra]]\n{{See also|Thali}}\n\nSince they occupy a vast area with distinct geographical differences and food availability, the Marathi people from different regions have produced a diverse cuisine. The diversity extends to the family level because each family uses its own unique combination of spices and ingredients.The majority of Maharashtrians are not averse to eating meat, fish and eggs, however, the staple diet for most people is mostly [[lacto-vegetarian]]. Many communities such as the brahmins, or the [[varkari]] sect members only follow the lacto-vegetarian diet.\n\nThe traditional staple food on Desh (the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] plateau) is usually ''[[bhakri]]'', spiced cooked vegetables, ''[[dal]]'' and rice. However, North Maharashtrians and urbanites prefer ''[[roti]]'' or ''[[chapati]]'', which is a plain bread made with [[wheat]] flour.\n\nIn the coastal [[Konkan]] region, rice is the traditional staple food. Wet [[coconut]] and coconut milk are used in many dishes. Marathi communities indigenous to Mumbai and North Konkan have their own distinct cuisine.<ref group=note>Some of the indigenous Marathi communities of North Konkan and Mumbai are [[Agri caste|Aagri]], [[Koli people|Koli]], [[Pathare Prabhu]], SKPs ([[Panchkalshi]]) and ([[Chaukalshi]]), [[CKP]]s and [[East Indians|East Indian Catholic]]</ref> In South Konkan, near [[Malvan]], another independent cuisine developed called [[Malvani cuisine]], which is predominantly non-vegetarian. ''[[Kombdi vade]]'', fish preparations and baked preparations are more popular there.\n\nIn the Vidarbha region, little coconut is used in daily preparations but dry coconut and peanuts are used in dishes such as spicy ''[[savji]]''s, as well as in mutton and chicken dishes.\n\nMaharashtrian lacto-vegetarian dishes are based on five main classes of ingredients that include grains, legumes, vegetables, dairy products and spices.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=K.S.|title=Maharashtra|date=2004|publisher=Popular Prakashan|location=Mumbai|isbn=81-7991-100-4|page=XLIX|edition=first|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=OmBjoAFMfjoC}}|accessdate=20 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Grains ===\nStaple dishes in the cuisine are based on a variety of [[flat bread|flatbreads]] and [[rice]].

It has distinctive attributes, while sharing much with other [[Indian cuisine]]<nowiki/>s. Traditionally, Maharashtrians have considered their food to be more austere than others.\n\nMaharashtrian cuisine includes mild and spicy dishes. [[Wheat]], [[rice]], ''[[jowar]]'', ''[[bajri]]'', [[vegetable]]s, [[lentil]]s and [[fruit]] are dietary [[Staple food|staples]]. [[Peanut]]s and [[cashew]]s are often served with vegetables. [[Meat]] was traditionally used sparsely or only by the well off until recently, because of economic conditions and culture.\n\nThe urban population in metropolitan cities such as [[Mumbai]], [[Pune]] and others has been influenced by cuisine from other parts of India and abroad. For example, the [[Udupi]] dishes ''[[idli]]'' and ''[[dosa]],'' as well as Chinese and Western dishes, are quite popular in home cooking, and in restaurants.\n\nDistinctly Maharashtrian dishes include ''ukdiche [[modak]]'', aluchi patal bhaji and [[Thalipeeth]].\n\n{{TOCLimit|3}}\n\n== Regular meals and staple dishes ==\n[[File:Maharashtra Districts.png|thumb|300px|Regions and districts of Maharashtra]]\n{{See also|Thali}}\n\nSince they occupy a vast area with distinct geographical differences and food availability, the Marathi people from different regions have produced a diverse cuisine. The diversity extends to the family level because each family uses its own unique combination of spices and ingredients.The majority of Maharashtrians are not averse to eating meat, fish and eggs, however, the staple diet for most people is mostly [[lacto-vegetarian]]. Many communities such as the brahmins, or the [[varkari]] sect members only follow the lacto-vegetarian diet.\n\nThe traditional staple food on Desh (the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] plateau) is usually ''[[bhakri]]'', spiced cooked vegetables, ''[[dal]]'' and rice. However, North Maharashtrians and urbanites prefer ''[[roti]]'' or ''[[chapati]]'', which is a plain bread made with [[wheat]] flour.\n\nIn the coastal [[Konkan]] region, rice is the traditional staple food. Wet [[coconut]] and coconut milk are used in many dishes. Marathi communities indigenous to Mumbai and North Konkan have their own distinct cuisine.<ref group=note>Some of the indigenous Marathi communities of North Konkan and Mumbai are [[Agri caste|Aagri]], [[Koli people|Koli]], [[Pathare Prabhu]], SKPs ([[Panchkalshi]]) and ([[Chaukalshi]]), [[CKP]]s and [[East Indians|East Indian Catholic]]</ref> In South Konkan, near [[Malvan]], another independent cuisine developed called [[Malvani cuisine]], which is predominantly non-vegetarian. ''[[Kombdi vade]]'', fish preparations and baked preparations are more popular there.\n\nIn the Vidarbha region, little coconut is used in daily preparations but dry coconut and peanuts are used in dishes such as spicy ''[[savji]]''s, as well as in mutton and chicken dishes.\n\nMaharashtrian lacto-vegetarian dishes are based on five main classes of ingredients that include grains, legumes, vegetables, dairy products and spices.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=K.S.|title=Maharashtra|date=2004|publisher=Popular Prakashan|location=Mumbai|isbn=81-7991-100-4|page=XLIX|edition=first|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=OmBjoAFMfjoC}}|accessdate=20 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Grains ===\nStaple dishes in the cuisine are based on a variety of [[flat bread|flatbreads]] and [[rice]].

This carries a distinct smell, either from that or various specially cultivated bacteria. Some blue cheeses are injected with [[spore]]s before the [[curds]] form, and others have spores mixed in with the curds after they form. Blue cheeses are typically aged in a temperature-controlled environment such as a [[cave]]. Blue cheese can be eaten by itself or can be spread, crumbled or melted into or over a range of other foods.\n\nThe characteristic flavor of blue cheeses tends to be sharp and salty. The smell of this food is due to both the mold and types of bacteria encouraged to grow on the cheese: for example, the bacterium ''[[Brevibacterium linens]]'' is responsible for the smell of many blue cheeses,<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Deetae P |author2=Bonnarme P |author3=Spinnler HE |author4=Helinck S |title=Production of volatile aroma compounds by bacterial strains isolated from different surface-ripened French cheeses |journal=Appl.

When he returned months later, the mold (''[[Penicillium roqueforti]]'') had transformed his cheese into Roquefort.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06EFDA143BF930A15755C0A964948260&sec=health|title=Blue-veined Cheeses : The expanding choices|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 23, 1982 | first=Florence | last=Fabricant | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref><ref name=bw>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2001-12-30/something-is-rotten-in-roquefort|title=Something is rotten in Roquefort|publisher=[[Business Week]]|date=December 31, 2001}}</ref>\n\n[[Gorgonzola (cheese)|Gorgonzola]] is one of the oldest known blue cheeses, having been created around AD 879, though it is said that it did not contain blue veins until around the 11th century.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gorgonzola, the cheese that lives|url=http://www.italianfoodexcellence.com/gorgonzola-the-cheese-that-lives/|website=Italian Food Excellence|accessdate=7 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Castello\u00ae Gorgonzola|url=http://www.castellocheese.com/en-ca/our-cheeses/gorgonzola/|website=Castello|accessdate=7 August 2016}}</ref> [[Stilton cheese|Stilton]] is a relatively new addition, becoming popular sometime in the early 1700s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stiltoncheese.co.uk/history_of_stilton|title=History of Stilton|last=|first=|date=|website=StiltonCheese.co.uk|publisher=|access-date=7 August 2016}}</ref> Many varieties of blue cheese that originated subsequently, such as the 20th century [[Danablu]] and [[Cambozola]], were an attempt to fill the demand for Roquefort-style cheeses that were prohibitive  due to either cost or politics.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Bavaria blu 01 WikiCheese Lokal K.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cambozola]], a German variety of blue cheese]]\nSimilarly to other varieties of cheese, the process of making blue cheese consists of six standard steps. However, additional ingredients and processes are required to give this blue-veined cheese its particular properties. To begin with, the commercial scale production of blue cheese consists of two phases: the culturing of suitable spore-rich inocula and fermentation for maximum, typical flavor.<ref name=\":1\">Watts, j.

However, all methods involve the use of a [[freeze-dried]] ''Penicillium roqueforti'' culture.

First, ''Penicillium roqueforti'' is washed from a pure culture agar plants which is later frozen.<ref name=\":3\" /> Through the freeze drying process, water from the frozen state is evaporated without the transition through the liquid state ([[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]).

In milk, casein does not aggregate because of the outer layer of the particle, called the  \u201chairy layer.\u201d The hairy layer consists of \u03ba-casein, which are strings of [[polypeptide]]s that extend outward from the center of the casein micelle.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shukla|first1=Anuj|last2=Narayanan|first2=Theyencheri|last3=Zanchi|first3=Drazen|title=Structure of casein micelles and their complexation with tannins|journal=Soft Matter|date=2009|volume=5|issue=15|page=2884|url=http://www.esrf.eu/UsersAndScience/Publications/Highlights/2009/scm/scm02|accessdate=17 December 2017|doi=10.1039/b903103k|bibcode=2009SMat....5.2884S}}</ref>  The entanglement of the hairy layer between casein micelles decreases the [[entropy]] of the system because it constrains the micelles, preventing them from spreading out. Curds form, however, due to the function that the [[enzyme]], rennet, plays in removing the hairy layer in the casein micelle. Rennet is an enzyme that cleaves the \u03ba-casein off the casein micelle, thus removing the strain that occurs when the hairy layer entangles. The casein micelles are then able to aggregate together when they collide with each other, forming the curds that can then be made into blue cheese.\n[[File:2015-01-25 Jersey Blue - St\u00e4dtch\u00e4si Lichtensteig - der Schweizer - hu - 8005.jpg|thumb|235x235px|Characteristic blue veins in blue cheese.]]\n\n=== Mold growth  ===\n''Penicillium roqueforti'' and ''Penicillium glaucum'' are both molds that require the presence of oxygen to grow. Therefore, initial fermentation of the cheese is done by [[lactic acid bacteria]].

In milk, casein does not aggregate because of the outer layer of the particle, called the  \u201chairy layer.\u201d The hairy layer consists of \u03ba-casein, which are strings of [[polypeptide]]s that extend outward from the center of the casein micelle.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shukla|first1=Anuj|last2=Narayanan|first2=Theyencheri|last3=Zanchi|first3=Drazen|title=Structure of casein micelles and their complexation with tannins|journal=Soft Matter|date=2009|volume=5|issue=15|page=2884|url=http://www.esrf.eu/UsersAndScience/Publications/Highlights/2009/scm/scm02|accessdate=17 December 2017|doi=10.1039/b903103k|bibcode=2009SMat....5.2884S}}</ref>  The entanglement of the hairy layer between casein micelles decreases the [[entropy]] of the system because it constrains the micelles, preventing them from spreading out. Curds form, however, due to the function that the [[enzyme]], rennet, plays in removing the hairy layer in the casein micelle. Rennet is an enzyme that cleaves the \u03ba-casein off the casein micelle, thus removing the strain that occurs when the hairy layer entangles. The casein micelles are then able to aggregate together when they collide with each other, forming the curds that can then be made into blue cheese.\n[[File:2015-01-25 Jersey Blue - St\u00e4dtch\u00e4si Lichtensteig - der Schweizer - hu - 8005.jpg|thumb|235x235px|Characteristic blue veins in blue cheese.]]\n\n=== Mold growth  ===\n''Penicillium roqueforti'' and ''Penicillium glaucum'' are both molds that require the presence of oxygen to grow. Therefore, initial fermentation of the cheese is done by [[lactic acid bacteria]].

He was the spiritual successor of 23rd [[tirthankara]] [[Parshvanatha]].{{sfn|Peter Heehs|2002|p=90}} Jain tradition holds that Mahavira was born in the early part of the 6th century BCE into a royal [[Kshatriya]] Jain family in present-day [[Bihar]], [[India]]. He abandoned all worldly possessions at the age of about 30 and left home in pursuit of [[spiritual awakening]], becoming an [[ascetic]]. Mahavira practiced intense meditation and severe austerities for 12 years, after which he is believed to have attained ''[[Kevala Jnana]]'' (omniscience). He preached for 30 years and is believed by Jains to have attained [[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]] (salvation) in the 6th century BC, although the year varies by [[Jain schools and branches|sect]].\n\nHistorically, Mahavira, who preached Jainism in ancient India, was a contemporary of [[Gautama Buddha]]. Scholars variously date him from 6th-4th century BCE and his place of birth is also a point of dispute among them.\n\nMahavira taught that observance of the vows of ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]]'' (non-violence), ''[[satya]]'' (truth), ''[[asteya]]'' (non-stealing), ''[[brahmacharya]]'' (chastity), and ''[[aparigraha]]'' (non-attachment) are necessary for spiritual liberation. He taught the principles of ''[[Anekantavada]]'' (many-sided reality): ''[[Anekantavada#Sy\u0101dv\u0101da|syadvada]]'' and ''[[Anekantavada#Nayav\u0101da|nayavada]]''. Mahavira's teachings were compiled by [[Indrabhuti Gautama]] (his chief disciple) as the [[Jain Agamas]]. The texts, transmitted [[oral tradition|orally]] by Jain monks, are believed to have been largely lost by about the 1st century CE (when the remaining were first written down in the Svetambara tradition). The surviving versions of the Agamas taught by Mahavira are some of [[Svetambara]] Jainism's foundation texts, but their authenticity is disputed in [[Digambara]] Jainism.\n\nMahavira is usually depicted in a sitting or standing meditative posture, with the symbol of a lion beneath him. His earliest iconography is from archaeological sites in the [[North India]]n city of [[Mathura]], and is dated from the 1st century BCE to the 2nd century CE. His birth is celebrated as [[Mahavir Janma Kalyanak]] and his ''[[nirvana]]'' (salvation) is observed by Jains as [[Diwali (Jainism)|Diwali]].\n\n=={{anchor|Titles & Names}}Names and epithets==\nSurviving early Jain and Buddhist literature uses several names (or [[epithet]]s) for Mahavira, including ''Nayaputta'', ''Muni'', ''Samana'', ''Niggantha'', ''Bramhan'', and ''Bhagavan''.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=25}} In early Buddhist ''[[Sutra|suttas]]'', he is referred to as ''Araha'' (\"worthy\") and ''Veyavi'' (derived from \"Vedas\", but meaning \"wise\" in this context; Mahavira did not recognize the [[Vedas]] as scripture).{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=25\u201326}} He is known as ''[[Sramana]]'' in the ''[[Kalpa S\u016btra]]'', \"devoid of love and hate\".{{sfn|Heehs|2002|p=93}}\n\nAccording to later Jain texts, Mahavira's childhood name was ''Vardham\u0101na'' (\"the one who grows\") because of the kingdom's prosperity at the time of his birth.{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=32}} According to the ''Kalpasutras'', he was called Mahavira (\"the great hero\") by the gods in the ''Kalpa S\u016btra'' because he remained steadfast in the midst of dangers, fears, hardships and calamities.{{sfn|Heehs|2002|p=93}} He is also known as a ''[[tirthankara]]''.{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=223}}\n\n==Historical Mahavira==\n[[File:Mahajanapadas (c. 500 BCE).png|alt=Map of India during the 6th century BCE|thumb|upright=1.15|Ancient kingdoms and cities of India at the time of Mahavira]]\nAlthough it is universally accepted by scholars of Jainism that Mahavira lived in ancient India, the details of his life and the year of his birth are subjects of debate.{{sfn|Potter|2007|pp=35\u201336}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=24\u201325}} According to the [[Digambara]] ''[[Uttarapurana]]'' text, Mahavira was born in Kundpur in the [[Kingdom of the Videhas]];{{sfn|Pannalal Jain|2015|p=460}} the [[\u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara]] ''Kalpa S\u016btra'' uses the name \"Kundagrama\",{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=25}}{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=682}} said to be located in present-day Bihar, India.

The Digambaras acknowledge that nineteen out of the twenty-four Tirthamkaras married and had children. If Mahavira also married it would make no difference. There is thus no reason whatsoever for the Digambaras to deny a simple incident like this. But there may be a reason for the Swetambaras making the assertion; the desire to ante-date their own origin. As a matter of fact their own books contain clear refutation of the statement that Mahavira had married.

Svetambara oppose this view by appealing to scriptures.\"{{sfn|Melton|Baumann|2010|p=1396}}}} According to this view, women are seen as a threat to a monk's chastity.{{sfn|Arvind Sharma|1994|pp=135\u2013138}}\n\nMahavirasvami had preached about men and women equality. The clothes-wearing Svetambaras have interpreted Mahavira's teaching as encouraging both sexes to pursue a mendicant, ascetic life with the possibility of ''moksha'' (''kaivalya'', spiritual liberation).{{sfn|Arvind Sharma|1994|pp=135\u2013138}}{{sfn|Harvey|2014|pp=182\u2013183}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=55\u201359}}\n\n=== Rebirth and realms of existence ===\n{{main|Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra (Jainism)}}\nRebirth and realms of existence are fundamental teachings of Mahavira. According to the [[Acaranga Sutra]], Mahavira believed that life existed in myriad forms which included animals, plants, insects, bodies of water, fire, and wind.{{sfn|Taylor|2008|pp=892\u2013894}}{{sfn|Chapelle|2011|pp=263\u2013270}} He taught that a monk should avoid touching or disturbing any of them (including plants) and never swim, light (or extinguish) a fire, or wave their arms in the air; such actions might injure other beings living in those states of matter.{{sfn|Taylor|2008|pp=892\u2013894}}\n\nMahavira preached that the nature of existence is cyclic, and the soul is reborn after death in one of the ''[[Trilok (Jainism)|trilok]]''{{snd}}the heavenly, hellish, or earthly realms of existence and suffering.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=41\u201342, 90\u201393}} Humans are reborn, depending on one's [[karma]] (actions) as a human, animal, element, microbe, or other form, on earth or in a heavenly (or hellish) realm.{{sfn|Taylor|2008|pp=892\u2013894}}{{sfn|Long|2009|pp=179\u2013181}}{{sfn|Gorski|2008|pp=125\u2013128}} Nothing is permanent; everyone (including gods, demons and earthly beings) dies and is reborn, based on their actions in their previous life.

The lack of detail and the mythical nature of legends about Parshvanatha,{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=220}}{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=16\u201317}} combined with medieval-era Svetambara texts portraying Parsvites as \"pseudo-ascetics\" with \"dubious practices of magic and astrology\", have led scholars to debate the evidence of Parshvanatha's historicity.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=30\u201333}} According to Dundas, Jains believe that Parshvanatha's lineage influenced Mahavira. Parshvanatha, as the one who \"removes obstacles and has the capacity to save\", is a popular icon; his image is the focus of Jain temple devotion.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=30\u201333}} Of the 24 ''tirthankaras'', Jain iconography has celebrated Mahavira and Parshvanatha the most; sculptures discovered at the [[Mathura]] archaeological site have been dated to the 1st{{nbsp}}century BCE.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=30\u201333}}{{sfn|Umakant P.

He was the spiritual successor of 23rd [[tirthankara]] [[Parshvanatha]].{{sfn|Peter Heehs|2002|p=90}} Jain tradition holds that Mahavira was born in the early part of the 6th century BCE into a royal [[Kshatriya]] Jain family in present-day [[Bihar]], [[India]]. He abandoned all worldly possessions at the age of about 30 and left home in pursuit of [[spiritual awakening]], becoming an [[ascetic]]. Mahavira practiced intense meditation and severe austerities for 12 years, after which he is believed to have attained ''[[Kevala Jnana]]'' (omniscience). He preached for 30 years and is believed by Jains to have attained [[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]] (salvation) in the 6th century BC, although the year varies by [[Jain schools and branches|sect]].\n\nHistorically, Mahavira, who preached Jainism in ancient India, was a contemporary of [[Gautama Buddha]]. Scholars variously date him from 6th-4th century BCE and his place of birth is also a point of dispute among them.\n\nMahavira taught that observance of the vows of ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]]'' (non-violence), ''[[satya]]'' (truth), ''[[asteya]]'' (non-stealing), ''[[brahmacharya]]'' (chastity), and ''[[aparigraha]]'' (non-attachment) are necessary for spiritual liberation. He taught the principles of ''[[Anekantavada]]'' (many-sided reality): ''[[Anekantavada#Sy\u0101dv\u0101da|syadvada]]'' and ''[[Anekantavada#Nayav\u0101da|nayavada]]''. Mahavira's teachings were compiled by [[Indrabhuti Gautama]] (his chief disciple) as the [[Jain Agamas]]. The texts, transmitted [[oral tradition|orally]] by Jain monks, are believed to have been largely lost by about the 1st century CE (when the remaining were first written down in the Svetambara tradition). The surviving versions of the Agamas taught by Mahavira are some of [[Svetambara]] Jainism's foundation texts, but their authenticity is disputed in [[Digambara]] Jainism.\n\nMahavira is usually depicted in a sitting or standing meditative posture, with the symbol of a lion beneath him. His earliest iconography is from archaeological sites in the [[North India]]n city of [[Mathura]], and is dated from the 1st century BCE to the 2nd century CE. His birth is celebrated as [[Mahavir Janma Kalyanak]] and his ''[[nirvana]]'' (salvation) is observed by Jains as [[Diwali (Jainism)|Diwali]].\n\n=={{anchor|Titles & Names}}Names and epithets==\nSurviving early Jain and Buddhist literature uses several names (or [[epithet]]s) for Mahavira, including ''Nayaputta'', ''Muni'', ''Samana'', ''Niggantha'', ''Bramhan'', and ''Bhagavan''.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=25}} In early Buddhist ''[[Sutra|suttas]]'', he is referred to as ''Araha'' (\"worthy\") and ''Veyavi'' (derived from \"Vedas\", but meaning \"wise\" in this context; Mahavira did not recognize the [[Vedas]] as scripture).{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=25\u201326}} He is known as ''[[Sramana]]'' in the ''[[Kalpa S\u016btra]]'', \"devoid of love and hate\".{{sfn|Heehs|2002|p=93}}\n\nAccording to later Jain texts, Mahavira's childhood name was ''Vardham\u0101na'' (\"the one who grows\") because of the kingdom's prosperity at the time of his birth.{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=32}} According to the ''Kalpasutras'', he was called Mahavira (\"the great hero\") by the gods in the ''Kalpa S\u016btra'' because he remained steadfast in the midst of dangers, fears, hardships and calamities.{{sfn|Heehs|2002|p=93}} He is also known as a ''[[tirthankara]]''.{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=223}}\n\n==Historical Mahavira==\n[[File:Mahajanapadas (c. 500 BCE).png|alt=Map of India during the 6th century BCE|thumb|upright=1.15|Ancient kingdoms and cities of India at the time of Mahavira]]\nAlthough it is universally accepted by scholars of Jainism that Mahavira lived in ancient India, the details of his life and the year of his birth are subjects of debate.{{sfn|Potter|2007|pp=35\u201336}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=24\u201325}} According to the [[Digambara]] ''[[Uttarapurana]]'' text, Mahavira was born in Kundpur in the [[Kingdom of the Videhas]];{{sfn|Pannalal Jain|2015|p=460}} the [[\u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara]] ''Kalpa S\u016btra'' uses the name \"Kundagrama\",{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=25}}{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=682}} said to be located in present-day Bihar, India.

It was the eighth final of the English Twenty20 competition, which was the first domestic Twenty20 competition between [[First-class cricket|first-class]] sides. \n\nHampshire were making their first appearance in a Twenty20 final, while Somerset were playing in their third final and their second in successive years, having previously won the [[2005 Twenty20 Cup|Twenty20 Cup in 2005]]. Somerset chose to [[Batting (cricket)|bat]] first and reached 173 for six; [[Craig Kieswetter]] was their highest scorer with 71 [[Run (cricket)|runs]], but was criticised for his slow start. [[Kieron Pollard]] was hit in the eye by a [[Bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]], and had to be taken to hospital, meaning he was not subsequently available to [[Bowling (cricket)|bowl]] for Somerset. In reply, Hampshire reached 62 from the [[Powerplay (cricket)|powerplay]], but then lost a cluster of [[wicket]]s. A steadying [[Partnership (cricket)|partnership]] between [[Neil McKenzie]] and [[Sean Ervine]] took them to the brink of victory, but another pair of wickets led to a tense finish. The match was eventually [[Tie (cricket)|tied]], and Hampshire won the title based on the fact they had lost fewer wickets.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Twenty20 Cup]] was a 20 [[Over (cricket)|overs]]-per-side competition established in 2003, which replaced the 50 overs-per-side '[[Benson & Hedges Cup]]'.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/counties/2458345.stm |title=Pure entertainment beckons |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 November 2002 |last=Brett |first=Oliver |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref> [[Hampshire County Cricket Club]] had never reached the final of the competition before,<ref name=\"winners\">{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/page/312342.html#winners |title=Six appeal |publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref> but had enjoyed recent success in [[one-day cricket]], having won the [[2009 Friends Provident Trophy]], a 50-over tournament.

Their [[Spin bowling|spin bowlers]], [[Murali Kartik]] and [[Arul Suppiah]] both bowled [[Economy rate (cricket)|economically]] to help restrict Northamptonshire to 112 [[Run (cricket)|runs]].

Having been asked to bat first, Essex scored 156; Briggs once again took three wickets for Hampshire, and [[Dominic Cork]] and [[Abdul Razzaq]] each bowled very economically. Essex bowled well to leave Hampshire needing 42 runs from the final four overs, but aggressive play from [[Sean Ervine]], [[Neil McKenzie]] and [[Michael Carberry]] took Hampshire to a six-wicket victory.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8053/report/435838/hampshire-vs-essex-1st-semi-final-friends-provident-t20-2010 |title=Briggs stars as Hampshire reach the final |last=McGlashan |first=Andrew |work=ESPNcricinfo |date=14 August 2010 |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref> Rain delayed the start of the second match, in which Somerset batted first against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]]. Attacking batting performances from [[Marcus Trescothick]] who scored a 28-ball 60, and [[Jos Buttler]] who made 55 not out from 23 [[Delivery (cricket)|balls]], propelled Somerset to 182 runs from their twenty overs. Further rain in between [[innings]] meant that Nottinghamshire were chasing a [[Duckworth\u2013Lewis\u2013Stern method|Duckworth-Lewis adjusted]] target of 152 runs from 16 overs. Aware that there was more rain around which might further curtail the match, they played attacking cricket, and remained around their [[Run rate|required rate]] throughout the innings, until the wicket of [[Samit Patel]] at the start of the 13th over.

Trego joined Kieswetter at the wicket, but the pair struggled on the damp ground. Kieswetter was particularly singled out for criticism during this stage of the match by ''ESPNcricinfo''{{'}}s Andrew McGlashan, who claimed he had a \"stodgy start\".<ref name=\"cireport\"/> Hampshire's young [[Left-arm orthodox spin|left-arm spin bowler]], Briggs, bowled well and had Trego caught at long-off in the twelfth over.<ref name=\"inn1\"/> Trego accumulated 33 runs from 24 balls; Somerset's second highest score of the innings.<ref name=\"ciscore\"/>\n\nAfter Trego's dismissal, Kieswetter began scoring more quickly, hitting 3 fours and 2 sixes to accelerate the innings before both himself and James Hildreth got out in quick succession. Hildreth, who had scored 12 runs, hit a full toss from Razzaq to Christian fielding at gully, and then four balls later, Kieswetter sliced a delivery from Christian to extra cover, where it was caught by Carberry.<ref name=\"inn1\"/> Kieswetter had scored 71 from 59 balls, after taking 37 deliveries to score his first 29 runs.<ref name=\"cireport\"/> The dismissals brought two new batsmen to the crease; Buttler and Pollard. Each faced seven deliveries, but while Buttler could only managed to score five runs before being caught at long-on, Pollard scored a four and 2 sixes.<ref name=\"inn1\"/> With three balls of the innings remaining, Pollard was surprised by a [[Bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]] from Cork which got in through the gap in his helmet grille and struck him in the eye.<ref name=\"cireport\"/> Pollard's eye was swollen shut, and he had to [[Not out|retire injured]] from the match and be taken to hospital.<ref name=\"critics\">{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/fpt20/content/story/472511.html |title=Dominic Cork says win proves critics wrong |last=McGlashan |first=Andrew |website=ESPNcricinfo |date=15 August 2010 |accessdate=1 June 2017}}</ref> Cork, who was shaken by the incident, dismissed Suppiah with the penultimate ball of the innings, and then prevented any runs from the final ball.

Adams and the new batsman, McKenzie, added 22 runs in the next three overs, before Adams got an inside edge to a delivery from Suppiah, and was bowled.

Christian was on strike for the final delivery, and another Hampshire player had come out to act as a runner for him. Christian missed the ball, which struck his pads. Somerset appealed for [[leg before wicket]], and the Hampshire batsmen ran a single. In the confusion and excitement, Christian himself ran, as well as his runner, meaning that he could have been run out. However, Somerset were distracted with their appeal, and did not notice.

It was the eighth final of the English Twenty20 competition, which was the first domestic Twenty20 competition between [[First-class cricket|first-class]] sides. \n\nHampshire were making their first appearance in a Twenty20 final, while Somerset were playing in their third final and their second in successive years, having previously won the [[2005 Twenty20 Cup|Twenty20 Cup in 2005]]. Somerset chose to [[Batting (cricket)|bat]] first and reached 173 for six; [[Craig Kieswetter]] was their highest scorer with 71 [[Run (cricket)|runs]], but was criticised for his slow start. [[Kieron Pollard]] was hit in the eye by a [[Bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]], and had to be taken to hospital, meaning he was not subsequently available to [[Bowling (cricket)|bowl]] for Somerset. In reply, Hampshire reached 62 from the [[Powerplay (cricket)|powerplay]], but then lost a cluster of [[wicket]]s. A steadying [[Partnership (cricket)|partnership]] between [[Neil McKenzie]] and [[Sean Ervine]] took them to the brink of victory, but another pair of wickets led to a tense finish. The match was eventually [[Tie (cricket)|tied]], and Hampshire won the title based on the fact they had lost fewer wickets.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Twenty20 Cup]] was a 20 [[Over (cricket)|overs]]-per-side competition established in 2003, which replaced the 50 overs-per-side '[[Benson & Hedges Cup]]'.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/counties/2458345.stm |title=Pure entertainment beckons |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 November 2002 |last=Brett |first=Oliver |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref> [[Hampshire County Cricket Club]] had never reached the final of the competition before,<ref name=\"winners\">{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/page/312342.html#winners |title=Six appeal |publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref> but had enjoyed recent success in [[one-day cricket]], having won the [[2009 Friends Provident Trophy]], a 50-over tournament.

Trego joined Kieswetter at the wicket, but the pair struggled on the damp ground. Kieswetter was particularly singled out for criticism during this stage of the match by ''ESPNcricinfo''{{'}}s Andrew McGlashan, who claimed he had a \"stodgy start\".<ref name=\"cireport\"/> Hampshire's young [[Left-arm orthodox spin|left-arm spin bowler]], Briggs, bowled well and had Trego caught at long-off in the twelfth over.<ref name=\"inn1\"/> Trego accumulated 33 runs from 24 balls; Somerset's second highest score of the innings.<ref name=\"ciscore\"/>\n\nAfter Trego's dismissal, Kieswetter began scoring more quickly, hitting 3 fours and 2 sixes to accelerate the innings before both himself and James Hildreth got out in quick succession. Hildreth, who had scored 12 runs, hit a full toss from Razzaq to Christian fielding at gully, and then four balls later, Kieswetter sliced a delivery from Christian to extra cover, where it was caught by Carberry.<ref name=\"inn1\"/> Kieswetter had scored 71 from 59 balls, after taking 37 deliveries to score his first 29 runs.<ref name=\"cireport\"/> The dismissals brought two new batsmen to the crease; Buttler and Pollard.

We denote the unique solution of this system by <math>\\mathbf{x}_*</math>.\n\n==As a direct method==\n\nWe say that two non-zero vectors '''u''' and '''v''' are [[Inner automorphism|conjugate]] (with respect to '''A''') if\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{u}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{v} = 0. </math>\n\nSince '''A''' is symmetric and positive-definite, the left-hand side defines an [[inner product space|inner product]]\n\n:<math>\n \\mathbf{u}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{v} =\n \\langle \\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v} \\rangle_\\mathbf{A} :=\n \\langle \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v}\\rangle =\n \\langle \\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{A}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{v}\\rangle =\n \\langle \\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{v}\\rangle.\n</math>\n\nTwo vectors are conjugate if and only if they are orthogonal with respect to this inner product. Being conjugate is a symmetric relation: if '''u''' is conjugate to '''v''', then '''v''' is conjugate to '''u'''. Suppose that\n\n:<math>P = \\{ \\mathbf{p}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{p}_n \\}</math>\n\nis a set of ''n'' mutually conjugate vectors (with respect to '''A'''). Then {{mvar|P}} forms a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>, and we may express the solution {{math|'''x'''<sub>\u2217</sub>}} of <math>\\mathbf{Ax} = \\mathbf{b}</math> in this basis:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{x}_* = \\sum^{n}_{i=1} \\alpha_i \\mathbf{p}_i.</math>\n\nBased on this expansion we calculate:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x}_* = \\sum^{n}_{i=1} \\alpha_i \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{p}_i.</math>\n\nLeft-multiplying by <math>\\mathbf{p}_k^\\mathsf{T}</math>:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{p}_k^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x}_* = \\sum^{n}_{i=1} \\alpha_i \\mathbf{p}_k^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{p}_i,</math>\n\nsubstituting <math>\\mathbf{Ax_*} = \\mathbf{b}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{u}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{v} = \\langle \\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v} \\rangle_\\mathbf{A}</math>:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{p}_k^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{b} = \\sum^{n}_{i=1} \\alpha_i \\left \\langle \\mathbf{p}_k, \\mathbf{p}_i \\right \\rangle_{\\mathbf{A}},</math>\n\nthen <math>\\mathbf{u}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{v} = \\langle \\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v} \\rangle</math> and using <math>\\forall i \\neq k: \\langle \\mathbf{p}_k, \\mathbf{p}_i \\rangle_{\\mathbf{A}} = 0</math> yields\n\n:<math>\\langle \\mathbf{p}_k, \\mathbf{b} \\rangle = \\alpha_k \\langle \\mathbf{p}_k, \\mathbf{p}_k \\rangle_{\\mathbf{A}},\n</math>\n\nwhich implies\n\n:<math>\\alpha_k = \\frac{\\langle \\mathbf{p}_k, \\mathbf{b} \\rangle}{\\langle \\mathbf{p}_k, \\mathbf{p}_k \\rangle_\\mathbf{A}}.</math>\n\nThis gives the following method for solving the equation {{math|'''Ax''' {{=}} '''b'''}}: find a sequence of ''n'' conjugate directions, and then compute the coefficients {{mvar|\u03b1<sub>k</sub>}}.\n\n==As an iterative method==\n\nIf we choose the conjugate vectors '''p'''<sub>''k''</sub> carefully, then we may not need all of them to obtain a good approximation to the solution {{math|'''x'''<sub>\u2217</sub>}}. So, we want to regard the conjugate gradient method as an iterative method. This also allows us to approximately solve systems where ''n'' is so large that the direct method would take too much time.\n \nWe denote the initial guess for {{math|'''x'''<sub>\u2217</sub>}} by {{math|'''x'''<sub>0</sub>}} (we can assume without loss of generality that {{math|'''x'''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} '''0'''}}, otherwise consider the system '''Az''' = '''b''' \u2212 '''Ax'''<sub>0</sub> instead). Starting with '''x'''<sub>0</sub> we search for the solution and in each iteration we need a metric to tell us whether we are closer to the solution {{math|'''x'''<sub>\u2217</sub>}} (that is unknown to us). This metric comes from the fact that the solution {{math|'''x'''<sub>\u2217</sub>}} is also the unique minimizer of the following [[quadratic function]]\n\n:<math> \n  f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\tfrac12 \\mathbf{x}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{b}, \\qquad \\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbf{R}^n \\,. \n</math>\nThe existence of a unique minimizer is apparent as its second derivative is given by a symmetric positive-definite matrix\n:<math>\n  \\nabla^2 f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{A} \\,,\n</math>\nand that the minimizer (use D''f''('''x''')=0) solves the initial problem is obvious from its first derivative\n:<math>\n  \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{b} \\,.\n</math>\n\n<!--  so if f('''x''') becomes smaller in an iteration it means that we are closer to {{math|'''x'''<sub>\u2217</sub>}}.Note that the +c has been added to the equation above. Without the c the trivial solution of x=0 is the minimum and the solution of the original equation. If x0 is the minimum, then the quadratic can be described as (x^T-x0^T)*A*(x-x0)-c0=0 (c0 is f at the minimum while x0 is the solution at the minimum). Expanding this you get x^T*X*x-x^T*b+c where b=2*A*x0 and c=x0^T*A*x0-c0 ... wait a minute... for the purposes of minimization c0 does not matter... if this is the case then c0 could be selected such that c0=x0^T*A*x0 in which case the original form x^T*X*x-x^T*b is still valid... -->\nThis suggests taking the first basis vector '''p'''<sub>0</sub> to be the negative  of the gradient of ''f'' at '''x''' = '''x'''<sub>0</sub>. The gradient of ''f'' equals {{math|'''Ax''' \u2212 '''b'''}}. Starting with an initial guess '''x'''<sub>0</sub>, this means we take '''p'''<sub>0</sub> = '''b''' \u2212 '''Ax'''<sub>0</sub>. The other vectors in the basis will be conjugate to the gradient, hence the name ''conjugate gradient method''.  Note that '''p'''<sub>0</sub> is also the [[residual (numerical analysis)|residual]] provided by this initial step of the algorithm.\n\nLet '''r'''<sub>''k''</sub> be the [[residual (numerical analysis)|residual]] at the ''k''th step:\n:<math> \\mathbf{r}_k = \\mathbf{b} - \\mathbf{Ax}_k.</math>\nAs observed above, '''r'''<sub>''k''</sub> is the negative gradient of ''f'' at '''x''' = '''x'''<sub>''k''</sub>, so the [[gradient descent]] method would require to move in the direction '''r'''<sub>''k''</sub>. Here, however, we insist that the directions '''p'''<sub>''k''</sub> be conjugate to each other. A practical way to enforce this, is by requiring that the next search direction be built out of the current residual and all previous search directions.<ref>The conjugation constraint is an orthonormal-type constraint and hence the algorithm bears resemblance to [[Gram\u2013Schmidt process|Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization]].</ref> This gives the following expression:\n:<math>\\mathbf{p}_{k} = \\mathbf{r}_{k} - \\sum_{i < k}\\frac{\\mathbf{p}_i^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{r}_{k}}{\\mathbf{p}_i^\\mathsf{T}\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{p}_i} \\mathbf{p}_i</math>\n(see the picture at the top of the article for the effect of the conjugacy constraint on convergence). Following this direction, the next optimal location is given by\n:<math> \\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \\mathbf{x}_k + \\alpha_k \\mathbf{p}_k </math>\nwith \n:<math> \\alpha_{k} = \\frac{\\mathbf{p}_k^\\mathsf{T} (\\mathbf{b} - \\mathbf{Ax}_k )}{\\mathbf{p}_k^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{p}_k} = \\frac{\\mathbf{p}_{k}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{r}_{k}}{\\mathbf{p}_{k}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{p}_{k}},  </math>\n\nwhere the last equality follows from the definition of '''r'''<sub>''k''</sub> .\nThe expression for <math> \\alpha_k </math> can be derived if one substitutes the expression for '''x'''<sub>''k''+1</sub> into ''f'' and minimizing it w.r.t. <math> \\alpha_k </math>\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nf(\\mathbf{x}_{k+1}) &= f(\\mathbf{x}_k + \\alpha_k \\mathbf{p}_k) =: g(\\alpha_k)\n  \\\\\ng'(\\alpha_k) &\\overset{!}{=} 0\n  \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad\n  \\alpha_{k} = \\frac{\\mathbf{p}_k^\\mathsf{T} (\\mathbf{b} - \\mathbf{Ax}_k)}{\\mathbf{p}_k^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{p}_k} \\,.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n===The resulting algorithm===\nThe above algorithm gives the most straightforward explanation of the conjugate gradient method.  Seemingly, the algorithm as stated requires storage of all previous searching directions and residue vectors, as well as many matrix-vector multiplications, and thus can be computationally expensive. However, a closer analysis of the algorithm shows that '''r'''<sub>''i''</sub> is orthogonal to '''r'''<sub>''j''</sub> ,   i.e. <math>\\mathbf{r}_i^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{r}_j=0 </math> , for i \u2260 j. And '''p'''<sub>''i''</sub> is A-orthogonal to '''p'''<sub>''j''</sub> ,   i.e. <math>\\mathbf{p}_i^\\mathsf{T}A \\mathbf{p}_j=0 </math> , for i \u2260 j. This can be regarded that as the algorithm progresses, '''p'''<sub>''i''</sub> and '''r'''<sub>''i''</sub> span the same Krylov subspace. Where '''r'''<sub>''i''</sub> form the orthogonal basis with respect to standard inner product, and '''p'''<sub>''i''</sub> form the orthogonal basis with respect to inner product induced by A. Therefore, '''x'''<sub>''k''</sub> can be regarded as the projection of '''x''' on the Krylov subspace.\n\nThe algorithm is detailed below for solving '''Ax''' = '''b''' where '''A''' is a real, symmetric, positive-definite matrix. The input vector '''x'''<sub>0</sub> can be an approximate initial solution or '''0'''. It is a different formulation of the exact procedure described above.\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n& \\mathbf{r}_0 := \\mathbf{b} - \\mathbf{A x}_0 \\\\\n& \\hbox{if } \\mathbf{r}_{0} \\text{ is sufficiently small, then return } \\mathbf{x}_{0} \\text{ as the result}\\\\\n& \\mathbf{p}_0 := \\mathbf{r}_0 \\\\\n& k := 0 \\\\\n& \\text{repeat} \\\\\n& \\qquad \\alpha_k := \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_k^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{r}_k}{\\mathbf{p}_k^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A p}_k}  \\\\\n& \\qquad \\mathbf{x}_{k+1} := \\mathbf{x}_k + \\alpha_k \\mathbf{p}_k \\\\\n& \\qquad \\mathbf{r}_{k+1} := \\mathbf{r}_k - \\alpha_k \\mathbf{A p}_k \\\\\n& \\qquad \\hbox{if } \\mathbf{r}_{k+1} \\text{ is sufficiently small, then exit loop} \\\\\n& \\qquad \\beta_k := \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_{k+1}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{r}_{k+1}}{\\mathbf{r}_k^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{r}_k} \\\\\n& \\qquad \\mathbf{p}_{k+1} := \\mathbf{r}_{k+1} + \\beta_k \\mathbf{p}_k \\\\\n& \\qquad k := k + 1 \\\\\n& \\text{end repeat} \\\\\n& \\text{return } \\mathbf{x}_{k+1} \\text{ as the result}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis is the most commonly used algorithm. The same formula for {{mvar|\u03b2<sub>k</sub>}} is also used in the Fletcher\u2013Reeves [[nonlinear conjugate gradient method]].\n\n====Computation of alpha and beta====\nIn the algorithm, {{mvar|\u03b1<sub>k</sub>}} is chosen such that <math>\\mathbf{r}_{k+1}</math> is orthogonal to '''r'''<sub>''k''</sub>. The denominator is simplified from\n\n:<math>\\alpha_k = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_{k}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{r}_{k}}{\\mathbf{r}_{k}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{p}_k} = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_k^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{r}_k}{\\mathbf{p}_k^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A p}_k} </math>\n\nsince <math>\\mathbf{r}_{k+1} = \\mathbf{p}_{k+1}-\\mathbf{\\beta}_{k}\\mathbf{p}_{k}</math>. The {{mvar|\u03b2<sub>k</sub>}} is chosen such that <math>\\mathbf{p}_{k+1}</math> is conjugated to '''p'''<sub>''k''</sub>. Initially, {{mvar|\u03b2<sub>k</sub>}} is\n\n:<math>\\beta_k = - \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_{k+1}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{p}_k}{\\mathbf{p}_k^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{p}_k}</math>\n\nusing\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{r}_{k+1} = \\mathbf{r}_{k} - \\alpha_{k} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{p}_{k}</math>\n\nand equivalently\n\n<math> \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{p}_{k} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_{k}} (\\mathbf{r}_{k} - \\mathbf{r}_{k+1}), </math>\n\nthe numerator of {{mvar|\u03b2<sub>k</sub>}} is rewritten as\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{r}_{k+1}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{p}_k = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_k} \\mathbf{r}_{k+1}^\\mathsf{T} (\\mathbf{r}_k - \\mathbf{r}_{k+1}) = - \\frac{1}{\\alpha_k} \\mathbf{r}_{k+1}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{r}_{k+1} </math>\n\nbecause <math>\\mathbf{r}_{k+1}</math> and '''r'''<sub>''k''</sub> are orthogonal by design. The denominator is rewritten as\n \n:<math> \\mathbf{p}_k^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{p}_k = (\\mathbf{r}_k + \\beta_{k-1} \\mathbf{p}_{k-1})^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{p}_k = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_k} \\mathbf{r}_k^\\mathsf{T} (\\mathbf{r}_k - \\mathbf{r}_{k+1}) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_k} \\mathbf{r}_k^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{r}_k </math>\n\nusing that the search directions '''p'''<sub>''k''</sub> are conjugated and again that the residuals are orthogonal. This gives the {{mvar|\u03b2}} in the algorithm after cancelling {{mvar|\u03b1<sub>k</sub>}}.\n\n====Example code in [[MATLAB]] / [[GNU Octave]]====\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\nfunction x = conjgrad(A, b, x)\n    r = b - A * x;\n    p = r;\n    rsold = r' * r;\n\n    for i = 1:length(b)\n        Ap = A * p;\n        alpha = rsold / (p' * Ap);\n        x = x + alpha * p;\n        r = r - alpha * Ap;\n        rsnew = r' * r;\n        if sqrt(rsnew) < 1e-10\n              break;\n        end\n        p = r + (rsnew / rsold) * p;\n        rsold = rsnew;\n    end\nend\n</source>\n\n===Numerical example===\n\nConsider the linear system '''Ax''' = '''b''' given by\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x}= \\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 3 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix},</math>\n\nwe will perform two steps of the conjugate gradient method beginning with the initial guess\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{x}_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nin order to find an approximate solution to the system.\n\n====Solution====\nFor reference, the exact solution is \n:<math> \\mathbf{x} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{11} \\\\\\\\ \\frac{7}{11} \\end{bmatrix} \\approx \\begin{bmatrix} 0.0909 \\\\\\\\ 0.6364 \\end{bmatrix}</math>\nOur first step is to calculate the residual vector '''r'''<sub>0</sub> associated with '''x'''<sub>0</sub>.  This residual is computed from the formula '''r'''<sub>0</sub> = '''b''' - '''Ax'''<sub>0</sub>, and in our case is equal to\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{r}_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix} - \n\\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 3 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \n\\begin{bmatrix}-8 \\\\ -3 \\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nSince this is the first iteration, we will use the residual vector '''r'''<sub>0</sub> as our initial search direction '''p'''<sub>0</sub>; the method of selecting '''p'''<sub>''k''</sub> will change in further iterations.\n\nWe now compute the scalar {{math|''\u03b1''<sub>0</sub>}} using the relationship\n\n:<math> \\alpha_0 = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_0^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{r}_0}{\\mathbf{p}_0^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A p}_0} = \\frac{\\begin{bmatrix} -8 & -3 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} -8 \\\\ -3 \\end{bmatrix}}{  \\begin{bmatrix} -8 & -3 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 3 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} -8 \\\\ -3 \\end{bmatrix}  } =\\frac{73}{331}.</math>\n\nWe can now compute '''x'''<sub>1</sub> using the formula\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{x}_1 = \\mathbf{x}_0 + \\alpha_0\\mathbf{p}_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} + \\frac{73}{331} \\begin{bmatrix} -8 \\\\ -3 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.2356 \\\\ 0.3384 \\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nThis result completes the first iteration, the result being an \"improved\" approximate solution to the system, '''x'''<sub>1</sub>. We may now move on and compute the next residual vector '''r'''<sub>1</sub> using the formula\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{r}_1 = \\mathbf{r}_0 - \\alpha_0 \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{p}_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} -8 \\\\ -3 \\end{bmatrix} - \\frac{73}{331} \\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 3 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} -8 \\\\ -3 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -0.2810 \\\\ 0.7492 \\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nOur next step in the process is to compute the scalar {{math|''\u03b2''<sub>0</sub>}} that will eventually be used to determine the next search direction '''p'''<sub>1</sub>.\n\n:<math>\\beta_0 = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_1^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{r}_1}{\\mathbf{r}_0^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{r}_0} = \\frac{\\begin{bmatrix} -0.2810 & 0.7492 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} -0.2810 \\\\ 0.7492 \\end{bmatrix}}{\\begin{bmatrix} -8 & -3 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} -8 \\\\ -3 \\end{bmatrix}} = 0.0088.</math>\n\nNow, using this scalar {{math|''\u03b2''<sub>0</sub>}}, we can compute the next search direction '''p'''<sub>1</sub> using the relationship\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{p}_1 = \\mathbf{r}_1 + \\beta_0 \\mathbf{p}_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} -0.2810 \\\\ 0.7492 \\end{bmatrix} + 0.0088 \\begin{bmatrix} -8 \\\\ -3 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -0.3511 \\\\ 0.7229 \\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nWe now compute the scalar {{math|''\u03b1''<sub>1</sub>}} using our newly acquired '''p'''<sub>1</sub> using the same method as that used for {{math|''\u03b1''<sub>0</sub>}}.\n\n:<math> \\alpha_1 = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_1^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{r}_1}{\\mathbf{p}_1^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A p}_1} = \\frac{\\begin{bmatrix} -0.2810 & 0.7492 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} -0.2810 \\\\ 0.7492 \\end{bmatrix}}{  \\begin{bmatrix} -0.3511 & 0.7229 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 3 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} -0.3511 \\\\ 0.7229 \\end{bmatrix}  } = 0.4122.</math>\n\nFinally, we find '''x'''<sub>2</sub> using the same method as that used to find '''x'''<sub>1</sub>.\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{x}_2 = \\mathbf{x}_1 + \\alpha_1 \\mathbf{p}_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.2356 \\\\ 0.3384 \\end{bmatrix} + 0.4122 \\begin{bmatrix} -0.3511 \\\\ 0.7229 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.0909 \\\\ 0.6364 \\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe result, '''x'''<sub>2</sub>, is a \"better\" approximation to the system's solution than '''x'''<sub>1</sub> and '''x'''<sub>0</sub>.  If exact arithmetic were to be used in this example instead of limited-precision, then the exact solution would theoretically have been reached after ''n'' = 2 iterations (''n'' being the order of the system).\n\n==Convergence properties==\nThe conjugate gradient method can theoretically be viewed as a direct method, as it produces the exact solution after a finite number of iterations, which is not larger than the size of the matrix, in the absence of [[round-off error]]. However, the conjugate gradient method is unstable with respect to even small perturbations, e.g., most directions are not in practice conjugate, and the exact solution is never obtained. Fortunately, the conjugate gradient method can be used as an [[iterative method]] as it provides monotonically improving approximations <math>\\mathbf{x}_{k}</math> to the exact solution, which may reach the required tolerance after a relatively small (compared to the problem size) number of iterations. The improvement is typically linear and its speed is determined by the [[condition number]] <math>\\kappa(A)</math> of the system matrix <math>A</math>: the larger <math>\\kappa(A)</math> is, the slower the improvement.<ref name=saad1996iterative>{{cite book|last=Saad|first=Yousef|title=Iterative methods for sparse linear systems|year=2003|publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=978-0-89871-534-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iterativemethods0000saad/page/195 195]|edition=2nd|url=https://archive.org/details/iterativemethods0000saad/page/195}}</ref>\n\nIf <math>\\kappa(A)</math> is large,  [[preconditioning]] is used to replace the original system <math>\\mathbf{A x}-\\mathbf{b} = 0</math> with <math>\\mathbf{M}^{-1}(\\mathbf{A x}-\\mathbf{b}) = 0</math> such that <math>\\kappa(\\mathbf{M}^{-1}\\mathbf{A})</math> is smaller than <math>\\kappa(\\mathbf{A})</math>, see below.\n\n=== Convergence theorem ===\n\nDefine a subset of polynomials as\n:<math>\n  \\Pi_k^* := \\left\\lbrace \\ p \\in \\Pi_k \\ : \\ p(0)=1 \\ \\right\\rbrace \\,,\n</math>\nwhere <math> \\Pi_k </math> is the set of [[Polynomial ring|polynomials]] of maximal degree <math> k </math>.\n\nLet <math> \\left( \\mathbf{x}_k \\right)_k </math> be the iterative approximations of the exact solution <math> \\mathbf{x}_* </math>, and define the errors as <math> \\mathbf{e}_k := \\mathbf{x}_k - \\mathbf{x}_* </math>.\nNow, the rate of convergence can be approximated as <ref>{{Cite book |title=Iterative solution of large sparse systems of equations |last=Hackbusch |first=W. |isbn=9783319284835 |edition=2nd |location=Switzerland |publisher=Springer |oclc=952572240|date=2016-06-21 }}</ref>\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n  \\left\\| \\mathbf{e}_k \\right\\|_\\mathbf{A}\n  &= \\min_{p \\in \\Pi_k^*}  \\left\\| p(\\mathbf{A}) \\mathbf{e}_0 \\right\\|_\\mathbf{A}\n  \\\\\n  &\\leq \\min_{p \\in \\Pi_k^*} \\,  \\max_{ \\lambda \\in \\sigma(\\mathbf{A})} | p(\\lambda) | \\  \\left\\|  \\mathbf{e}_0 \\right\\|_\\mathbf{A}\n  \\\\\n  &\\leq 2 \\left( \\frac{ \\sqrt{\\kappa(\\mathbf{A})}-1 }{ \\sqrt{\\kappa(\\mathbf{A})}+1 } \\right)^k \\ \\left\\|  \\mathbf{e}_0 \\right\\|_\\mathbf{A}\n  \\,,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nwhere <math> \\sigma(\\mathbf{A}) </math> denotes the [[Spectrum of a matrix|spectrum]], and <math> \\kappa(\\mathbf{A}) </math> denotes the [[condition number]].\n\nNote, the important limit when <math> \\kappa(\\mathbf{A}) </math> tends to <math> \\infty </math>\n:<math>\n  \\frac{ \\sqrt{\\kappa(\\mathbf{A})}-1 }{ \\sqrt{\\kappa(\\mathbf{A})}+1 }\n  \\approx 1 - \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\kappa(\\mathbf{A})}}\n  \\quad \\text{for} \\quad\n  \\kappa(\\mathbf{A}) \\gg 1\n  \\,.\n</math>\nThis limit shows a faster convergence rate compared to the iterative methods of [[Jacobi method|Jacobi]] or [[Gauss\u2013Seidel method|Gauss\u2013Seidel]] which scale as <math> \\approx 1 - \\frac{2}{\\kappa(\\mathbf{A})} </math>.\n\n==The preconditioned conjugate gradient method==\n{{See also|Preconditioner}}\nIn most cases, [[preconditioning]] is necessary to ensure fast convergence of the conjugate gradient method.

With this substitution, vectors {{math|'''p'''}} are always the same as vectors {{math|'''z'''}}, so there is no need to store vectors {{math|'''p'''}}. Thus, every iteration of these [[steepest descent]] methods is a bit cheaper compared to that for the conjugate gradient methods. However, the latter converge faster, unless a (highly) variable and/or non-SPD [[preconditioner]] is used, see above.\n\n==Derivation of the method==\n{{main|Derivation of the conjugate gradient method}}\n\nThe conjugate gradient method can be derived from several different perspectives, including specialization of the conjugate direction method for optimization, and variation of the [[Arnoldi iteration|Arnoldi]]/[[Lanczos iteration|Lanczos]] iteration for [[eigenvalue]] problems. Despite differences in their approaches, these derivations share a common topic\u2014proving the orthogonality of the residuals and conjugacy of the search directions. These two properties are crucial to developing the well-known succinct formulation of the method.\n\n==Conjugate gradient on the normal equations==\nThe conjugate gradient method can be applied to an arbitrary ''n''-by-''m'' matrix by applying it to [[normal equations]] '''A'''<sup>T</sup>'''A''' and right-hand side vector '''A'''<sup>T</sup>'''b''', since  '''A'''<sup>T</sup>'''A''' is a symmetric [[Positive-definite matrix#Negative-definite.2C semidefinite and indefinite matrices|positive-semidefinite]] matrix for any '''A'''. The result is conjugate gradient on the normal equations (CGNR).\n\n: '''A'''<sup>T</sup>'''Ax''' =  '''A'''<sup>T</sup>'''b'''\n\nAs an iterative method, it is not necessary to form  '''A'''<sup>T</sup>'''A''' explicitly in memory but only to perform the matrix-vector and transpose matrix-vector multiplications. Therefore, CGNR is particularly useful when ''A'' is a [[sparse matrix]] since these operations are usually extremely efficient. However the downside of forming the normal equations is that the [[condition number]] \u03ba('''A'''<sup>T</sup>'''A''') is equal to \u03ba<sup>2</sup>('''A''') and so the rate of convergence of CGNR may be slow and the quality of the approximate solution may be sensitive to roundoff errors. Finding a good [[preconditioner]] is often an important part of using the CGNR method.\n\nSeveral algorithms have been proposed (e.g., CGLS, LSQR). The LSQR algorithm purportedly has the best numerical stability when '''A''' is ill-conditioned, i.e., '''A''' has a large [[condition number]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Biconjugate gradient method]] (BiCG)\n* [[Conjugate residual method]]\n* [[Belief propagation#Gaussian belief propagation .28GaBP.29|Gaussian belief propagation]]\n* [[Iterative method#Linear systems|Iterative method: Linear systems]]\n* [[Krylov subspace]]\n* [[Nonlinear conjugate gradient]] method\n* [[Preconditioning]]\n* [[Sparse matrix-vector multiplication]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|first=Kendell A. |last=Atkinson |year=1988|title=An introduction to numerical analysis|edition=2nd |chapter= Section 8.9|publisher= John Wiley and Sons| isbn= 978-0-471-50023-0}}\n* {{cite book|first=Mordecai|last= Avriel |year=2003|title=Nonlinear Programming: Analysis and Methods|publisher= Dover Publishing| isbn= 978-0-486-43227-4}}\n* {{cite book|first1=Gene H. |last1=Golub |first2= Charles F.|last2= Van Loan|title=Matrix computations|edition=3rd|chapter= Chapter 10|publisher= Johns Hopkins University Press| isbn =978-0-8018-5414-9|date=1996-10-15 }}\n* {{cite book|first=Yousef|last=Saad|title=Iterative methods for sparse linear systems|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/iterativemethods0000saad|chapter-url-access=registration|edition=2nd|chapter=Chapter 6|publisher=SIAM|isbn=978-0-89871-534-7|date=2003-04-01|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iterativemethods0000saad}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{springer|title=Conjugate gradients, method of|id=p/c025030}}\n\n{{Numerical linear algebra}}\n{{authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Conjugate Gradient Method}}\n[[Category:Numerical linear algebra]]\n[[Category:Gradient methods]]\n[[Category:Articles with example MATLAB/Octave code]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Conjugate gradient illustration.svg|right|thumb|A comparison of the convergence of [[gradient descent]] with optimal step size (in green) and conjugate vector (in red) for minimizing a quadratic function associated with a given linear system.

We denote the unique solution of this system by <math>\\mathbf{x}_*</math>.\n\n==As a direct method==\n\nWe say that two non-zero vectors '''u''' and '''v''' are [[Inner automorphism|conjugate]] (with respect to '''A''') if\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{u}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{v} = 0. </math>\n\nSince '''A''' is symmetric and positive-definite, the left-hand side defines an [[inner product space|inner product]]\n\n:<math>\n \\mathbf{u}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{v} =\n \\langle \\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v} \\rangle_\\mathbf{A} :=\n \\langle \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v}\\rangle =\n \\langle \\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{A}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{v}\\rangle =\n \\langle \\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{v}\\rangle.\n</math>\n\nTwo vectors are conjugate if and only if they are orthogonal with respect to this inner product. Being conjugate is a symmetric relation: if '''u''' is conjugate to '''v''', then '''v''' is conjugate to '''u'''. Suppose that\n\n:<math>P = \\{ \\mathbf{p}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{p}_n \\}</math>\n\nis a set of ''n'' mutually conjugate vectors (with respect to '''A'''). Then {{mvar|P}} forms a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>, and we may express the solution {{math|'''x'''<sub>\u2217</sub>}} of <math>\\mathbf{Ax} = \\mathbf{b}</math> in this basis:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{x}_* = \\sum^{n}_{i=1} \\alpha_i \\mathbf{p}_i.</math>\n\nBased on this expansion we calculate:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x}_* = \\sum^{n}_{i=1} \\alpha_i \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{p}_i.</math>\n\nLeft-multiplying by <math>\\mathbf{p}_k^\\mathsf{T}</math>:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{p}_k^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x}_* = \\sum^{n}_{i=1} \\alpha_i \\mathbf{p}_k^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{p}_i,</math>\n\nsubstituting <math>\\mathbf{Ax_*} = \\mathbf{b}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{u}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{v} = \\langle \\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v} \\rangle_\\mathbf{A}</math>:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{p}_k^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{b} = \\sum^{n}_{i=1} \\alpha_i \\left \\langle \\mathbf{p}_k, \\mathbf{p}_i \\right \\rangle_{\\mathbf{A}},</math>\n\nthen <math>\\mathbf{u}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{v} = \\langle \\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v} \\rangle</math> and using <math>\\forall i \\neq k: \\langle \\mathbf{p}_k, \\mathbf{p}_i \\rangle_{\\mathbf{A}} = 0</math> yields\n\n:<math>\\langle \\mathbf{p}_k, \\mathbf{b} \\rangle = \\alpha_k \\langle \\mathbf{p}_k, \\mathbf{p}_k \\rangle_{\\mathbf{A}},\n</math>\n\nwhich implies\n\n:<math>\\alpha_k = \\frac{\\langle \\mathbf{p}_k, \\mathbf{b} \\rangle}{\\langle \\mathbf{p}_k, \\mathbf{p}_k \\rangle_\\mathbf{A}}.</math>\n\nThis gives the following method for solving the equation {{math|'''Ax''' {{=}} '''b'''}}: find a sequence of ''n'' conjugate directions, and then compute the coefficients {{mvar|\u03b1<sub>k</sub>}}.\n\n==As an iterative method==\n\nIf we choose the conjugate vectors '''p'''<sub>''k''</sub> carefully, then we may not need all of them to obtain a good approximation to the solution {{math|'''x'''<sub>\u2217</sub>}}. So, we want to regard the conjugate gradient method as an iterative method. This also allows us to approximately solve systems where ''n'' is so large that the direct method would take too much time.\n \nWe denote the initial guess for {{math|'''x'''<sub>\u2217</sub>}} by {{math|'''x'''<sub>0</sub>}} (we can assume without loss of generality that {{math|'''x'''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} '''0'''}}, otherwise consider the system '''Az''' = '''b''' \u2212 '''Ax'''<sub>0</sub> instead). Starting with '''x'''<sub>0</sub> we search for the solution and in each iteration we need a metric to tell us whether we are closer to the solution {{math|'''x'''<sub>\u2217</sub>}} (that is unknown to us). This metric comes from the fact that the solution {{math|'''x'''<sub>\u2217</sub>}} is also the unique minimizer of the following [[quadratic function]]\n\n:<math> \n  f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\tfrac12 \\mathbf{x}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{b}, \\qquad \\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbf{R}^n \\,. \n</math>\nThe existence of a unique minimizer is apparent as its second derivative is given by a symmetric positive-definite matrix\n:<math>\n  \\nabla^2 f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{A} \\,,\n</math>\nand that the minimizer (use D''f''('''x''')=0) solves the initial problem is obvious from its first derivative\n:<math>\n  \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{b} \\,.\n</math>\n\n<!--  so if f('''x''') becomes smaller in an iteration it means that we are closer to {{math|'''x'''<sub>\u2217</sub>}}.Note that the +c has been added to the equation above. Without the c the trivial solution of x=0 is the minimum and the solution of the original equation. If x0 is the minimum, then the quadratic can be described as (x^T-x0^T)*A*(x-x0)-c0=0 (c0 is f at the minimum while x0 is the solution at the minimum). Expanding this you get x^T*X*x-x^T*b+c where b=2*A*x0 and c=x0^T*A*x0-c0 ... wait a minute... for the purposes of minimization c0 does not matter... if this is the case then c0 could be selected such that c0=x0^T*A*x0 in which case the original form x^T*X*x-x^T*b is still valid... -->\nThis suggests taking the first basis vector '''p'''<sub>0</sub> to be the negative  of the gradient of ''f'' at '''x''' = '''x'''<sub>0</sub>. The gradient of ''f'' equals {{math|'''Ax''' \u2212 '''b'''}}. Starting with an initial guess '''x'''<sub>0</sub>, this means we take '''p'''<sub>0</sub> = '''b''' \u2212 '''Ax'''<sub>0</sub>. The other vectors in the basis will be conjugate to the gradient, hence the name ''conjugate gradient method''.  Note that '''p'''<sub>0</sub> is also the [[residual (numerical analysis)|residual]] provided by this initial step of the algorithm.\n\nLet '''r'''<sub>''k''</sub> be the [[residual (numerical analysis)|residual]] at the ''k''th step:\n:<math> \\mathbf{r}_k = \\mathbf{b} - \\mathbf{Ax}_k.</math>\nAs observed above, '''r'''<sub>''k''</sub> is the negative gradient of ''f'' at '''x''' = '''x'''<sub>''k''</sub>, so the [[gradient descent]] method would require to move in the direction '''r'''<sub>''k''</sub>. Here, however, we insist that the directions '''p'''<sub>''k''</sub> be conjugate to each other. A practical way to enforce this, is by requiring that the next search direction be built out of the current residual and all previous search directions.<ref>The conjugation constraint is an orthonormal-type constraint and hence the algorithm bears resemblance to [[Gram\u2013Schmidt process|Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization]].</ref> This gives the following expression:\n:<math>\\mathbf{p}_{k} = \\mathbf{r}_{k} - \\sum_{i < k}\\frac{\\mathbf{p}_i^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{r}_{k}}{\\mathbf{p}_i^\\mathsf{T}\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{p}_i} \\mathbf{p}_i</math>\n(see the picture at the top of the article for the effect of the conjugacy constraint on convergence). Following this direction, the next optimal location is given by\n:<math> \\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \\mathbf{x}_k + \\alpha_k \\mathbf{p}_k </math>\nwith \n:<math> \\alpha_{k} = \\frac{\\mathbf{p}_k^\\mathsf{T} (\\mathbf{b} - \\mathbf{Ax}_k )}{\\mathbf{p}_k^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{p}_k} = \\frac{\\mathbf{p}_{k}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{r}_{k}}{\\mathbf{p}_{k}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{p}_{k}},  </math>\n\nwhere the last equality follows from the definition of '''r'''<sub>''k''</sub> .\nThe expression for <math> \\alpha_k </math> can be derived if one substitutes the expression for '''x'''<sub>''k''+1</sub> into ''f'' and minimizing it w.r.t. <math> \\alpha_k </math>\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nf(\\mathbf{x}_{k+1}) &= f(\\mathbf{x}_k + \\alpha_k \\mathbf{p}_k) =: g(\\alpha_k)\n  \\\\\ng'(\\alpha_k) &\\overset{!}{=} 0\n  \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad\n  \\alpha_{k} = \\frac{\\mathbf{p}_k^\\mathsf{T} (\\mathbf{b} - \\mathbf{Ax}_k)}{\\mathbf{p}_k^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{p}_k} \\,.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n===The resulting algorithm===\nThe above algorithm gives the most straightforward explanation of the conjugate gradient method.  Seemingly, the algorithm as stated requires storage of all previous searching directions and residue vectors, as well as many matrix-vector multiplications, and thus can be computationally expensive. However, a closer analysis of the algorithm shows that '''r'''<sub>''i''</sub> is orthogonal to '''r'''<sub>''j''</sub> ,   i.e. <math>\\mathbf{r}_i^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{r}_j=0 </math> , for i \u2260 j. And '''p'''<sub>''i''</sub> is A-orthogonal to '''p'''<sub>''j''</sub> ,   i.e. <math>\\mathbf{p}_i^\\mathsf{T}A \\mathbf{p}_j=0 </math> , for i \u2260 j. This can be regarded that as the algorithm progresses, '''p'''<sub>''i''</sub> and '''r'''<sub>''i''</sub> span the same Krylov subspace. Where '''r'''<sub>''i''</sub> form the orthogonal basis with respect to standard inner product, and '''p'''<sub>''i''</sub> form the orthogonal basis with respect to inner product induced by A. Therefore, '''x'''<sub>''k''</sub> can be regarded as the projection of '''x''' on the Krylov subspace.\n\nThe algorithm is detailed below for solving '''Ax''' = '''b''' where '''A''' is a real, symmetric, positive-definite matrix. The input vector '''x'''<sub>0</sub> can be an approximate initial solution or '''0'''. It is a different formulation of the exact procedure described above.\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n& \\mathbf{r}_0 := \\mathbf{b} - \\mathbf{A x}_0 \\\\\n& \\hbox{if } \\mathbf{r}_{0} \\text{ is sufficiently small, then return } \\mathbf{x}_{0} \\text{ as the result}\\\\\n& \\mathbf{p}_0 := \\mathbf{r}_0 \\\\\n& k := 0 \\\\\n& \\text{repeat} \\\\\n& \\qquad \\alpha_k := \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_k^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{r}_k}{\\mathbf{p}_k^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{A p}_k}  \\\\\n& \\qquad \\mathbf{x}_{k+1} := \\mathbf{x}_k + \\alpha_k \\mathbf{p}_k \\\\\n& \\qquad \\mathbf{r}_{k+1} := \\mathbf{r}_k - \\alpha_k \\mathbf{A p}_k \\\\\n& \\qquad \\hbox{if } \\mathbf{r}_{k+1} \\text{ is sufficiently small, then exit loop} \\\\\n& \\qquad \\beta_k := \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_{k+1}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{r}_{k+1}}{\\mathbf{r}_k^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{r}_k} \\\\\n& \\qquad \\mathbf{p}_{k+1} := \\mathbf{r}_{k+1} + \\beta_k \\mathbf{p}_k \\\\\n& \\qquad k := k + 1 \\\\\n& \\text{end repeat} \\\\\n& \\text{return } \\mathbf{x}_{k+1} \\text{ as the result}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis is the most commonly used algorithm.

If exact arithmetic were to be used in this example instead of limited-precision, then the exact solution would theoretically have been reached after ''n'' = 2 iterations (''n'' being the order of the system).\n\n==Convergence properties==\nThe conjugate gradient method can theoretically be viewed as a direct method, as it produces the exact solution after a finite number of iterations, which is not larger than the size of the matrix, in the absence of [[round-off error]]. However, the conjugate gradient method is unstable with respect to even small perturbations, e.g., most directions are not in practice conjugate, and the exact solution is never obtained. Fortunately, the conjugate gradient method can be used as an [[iterative method]] as it provides monotonically improving approximations <math>\\mathbf{x}_{k}</math> to the exact solution, which may reach the required tolerance after a relatively small (compared to the problem size) number of iterations. The improvement is typically linear and its speed is determined by the [[condition number]] <math>\\kappa(A)</math> of the system matrix <math>A</math>: the larger <math>\\kappa(A)</math> is, the slower the improvement.<ref name=saad1996iterative>{{cite book|last=Saad|first=Yousef|title=Iterative methods for sparse linear systems|year=2003|publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=978-0-89871-534-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iterativemethods0000saad/page/195 195]|edition=2nd|url=https://archive.org/details/iterativemethods0000saad/page/195}}</ref>\n\nIf <math>\\kappa(A)</math> is large,  [[preconditioning]] is used to replace the original system <math>\\mathbf{A x}-\\mathbf{b} = 0</math> with <math>\\mathbf{M}^{-1}(\\mathbf{A x}-\\mathbf{b}) = 0</math> such that <math>\\kappa(\\mathbf{M}^{-1}\\mathbf{A})</math> is smaller than <math>\\kappa(\\mathbf{A})</math>, see below.\n\n=== Convergence theorem ===\n\nDefine a subset of polynomials as\n:<math>\n  \\Pi_k^* := \\left\\lbrace \\ p \\in \\Pi_k \\ : \\ p(0)=1 \\ \\right\\rbrace \\,,\n</math>\nwhere <math> \\Pi_k </math> is the set of [[Polynomial ring|polynomials]] of maximal degree <math> k </math>.\n\nLet <math> \\left( \\mathbf{x}_k \\right)_k </math> be the iterative approximations of the exact solution <math> \\mathbf{x}_* </math>, and define the errors as <math> \\mathbf{e}_k := \\mathbf{x}_k - \\mathbf{x}_* </math>.\nNow, the rate of convergence can be approximated as <ref>{{Cite book |title=Iterative solution of large sparse systems of equations |last=Hackbusch |first=W. |isbn=9783319284835 |edition=2nd |location=Switzerland |publisher=Springer |oclc=952572240|date=2016-06-21 }}</ref>\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n  \\left\\| \\mathbf{e}_k \\right\\|_\\mathbf{A}\n  &= \\min_{p \\in \\Pi_k^*}  \\left\\| p(\\mathbf{A}) \\mathbf{e}_0 \\right\\|_\\mathbf{A}\n  \\\\\n  &\\leq \\min_{p \\in \\Pi_k^*} \\,  \\max_{ \\lambda \\in \\sigma(\\mathbf{A})} | p(\\lambda) | \\  \\left\\|  \\mathbf{e}_0 \\right\\|_\\mathbf{A}\n  \\\\\n  &\\leq 2 \\left( \\frac{ \\sqrt{\\kappa(\\mathbf{A})}-1 }{ \\sqrt{\\kappa(\\mathbf{A})}+1 } \\right)^k \\ \\left\\|  \\mathbf{e}_0 \\right\\|_\\mathbf{A}\n  \\,,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nwhere <math> \\sigma(\\mathbf{A}) </math> denotes the [[Spectrum of a matrix|spectrum]], and <math> \\kappa(\\mathbf{A}) </math> denotes the [[condition number]].\n\nNote, the important limit when <math> \\kappa(\\mathbf{A}) </math> tends to <math> \\infty </math>\n:<math>\n  \\frac{ \\sqrt{\\kappa(\\mathbf{A})}-1 }{ \\sqrt{\\kappa(\\mathbf{A})}+1 }\n  \\approx 1 - \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\kappa(\\mathbf{A})}}\n  \\quad \\text{for} \\quad\n  \\kappa(\\mathbf{A}) \\gg 1\n  \\,.\n</math>\nThis limit shows a faster convergence rate compared to the iterative methods of [[Jacobi method|Jacobi]] or [[Gauss\u2013Seidel method|Gauss\u2013Seidel]] which scale as <math> \\approx 1 - \\frac{2}{\\kappa(\\mathbf{A})} </math>.\n\n==The preconditioned conjugate gradient method==\n{{See also|Preconditioner}}\nIn most cases, [[preconditioning]] is necessary to ensure fast convergence of the conjugate gradient method.

With this substitution, vectors {{math|'''p'''}} are always the same as vectors {{math|'''z'''}}, so there is no need to store vectors {{math|'''p'''}}. Thus, every iteration of these [[steepest descent]] methods is a bit cheaper compared to that for the conjugate gradient methods. However, the latter converge faster, unless a (highly) variable and/or non-SPD [[preconditioner]] is used, see above.\n\n==Derivation of the method==\n{{main|Derivation of the conjugate gradient method}}\n\nThe conjugate gradient method can be derived from several different perspectives, including specialization of the conjugate direction method for optimization, and variation of the [[Arnoldi iteration|Arnoldi]]/[[Lanczos iteration|Lanczos]] iteration for [[eigenvalue]] problems. Despite differences in their approaches, these derivations share a common topic\u2014proving the orthogonality of the residuals and conjugacy of the search directions. These two properties are crucial to developing the well-known succinct formulation of the method.\n\n==Conjugate gradient on the normal equations==\nThe conjugate gradient method can be applied to an arbitrary ''n''-by-''m'' matrix by applying it to [[normal equations]] '''A'''<sup>T</sup>'''A''' and right-hand side vector '''A'''<sup>T</sup>'''b''', since  '''A'''<sup>T</sup>'''A''' is a symmetric [[Positive-definite matrix#Negative-definite.2C semidefinite and indefinite matrices|positive-semidefinite]] matrix for any '''A'''. The result is conjugate gradient on the normal equations (CGNR).\n\n: '''A'''<sup>T</sup>'''Ax''' =  '''A'''<sup>T</sup>'''b'''\n\nAs an iterative method, it is not necessary to form  '''A'''<sup>T</sup>'''A''' explicitly in memory but only to perform the matrix-vector and transpose matrix-vector multiplications. Therefore, CGNR is particularly useful when ''A'' is a [[sparse matrix]] since these operations are usually extremely efficient. However the downside of forming the normal equations is that the [[condition number]] \u03ba('''A'''<sup>T</sup>'''A''') is equal to \u03ba<sup>2</sup>('''A''') and so the rate of convergence of CGNR may be slow and the quality of the approximate solution may be sensitive to roundoff errors. Finding a good [[preconditioner]] is often an important part of using the CGNR method.\n\nSeveral algorithms have been proposed (e.g., CGLS, LSQR). The LSQR algorithm purportedly has the best numerical stability when '''A''' is ill-conditioned, i.e., '''A''' has a large [[condition number]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Biconjugate gradient method]] (BiCG)\n* [[Conjugate residual method]]\n* [[Belief propagation#Gaussian belief propagation .28GaBP.29|Gaussian belief propagation]]\n* [[Iterative method#Linear systems|Iterative method: Linear systems]]\n* [[Krylov subspace]]\n* [[Nonlinear conjugate gradient]] method\n* [[Preconditioning]]\n* [[Sparse matrix-vector multiplication]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|first=Kendell A. |last=Atkinson |year=1988|title=An introduction to numerical analysis|edition=2nd |chapter= Section 8.9|publisher= John Wiley and Sons| isbn= 978-0-471-50023-0}}\n* {{cite book|first=Mordecai|last= Avriel |year=2003|title=Nonlinear Programming: Analysis and Methods|publisher= Dover Publishing| isbn= 978-0-486-43227-4}}\n* {{cite book|first1=Gene H. |last1=Golub |first2= Charles F.|last2= Van Loan|title=Matrix computations|edition=3rd|chapter= Chapter 10|publisher= Johns Hopkins University Press| isbn =978-0-8018-5414-9|date=1996-10-15 }}\n* {{cite book|first=Yousef|last=Saad|title=Iterative methods for sparse linear systems|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/iterativemethods0000saad|chapter-url-access=registration|edition=2nd|chapter=Chapter 6|publisher=SIAM|isbn=978-0-89871-534-7|date=2003-04-01|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iterativemethods0000saad}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{springer|title=Conjugate gradients, method of|id=p/c025030}}\n\n{{Numerical linear algebra}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Conjugate Gradient Method}}\n[[Category:Numerical linear algebra]]\n[[Category:Gradient methods]]\n[[Category:Articles with example MATLAB/Octave code]]\n", "name_user": "MathXplore", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method"}
