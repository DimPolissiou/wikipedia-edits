Often [[bedridden]] with high fevers until the age of six she took to drawing as a way to keep herself entertained. Her mother sought out traditional herbal treatments, which not only ended her fevers but also inspired her mother's next career as a doctor of [[Traditional Chinese medicine|Chinese medicine]] <ref name='Communication Arts' />\n\nHer [[uncle|great uncle]] was a surgeon with a passion for meticulous [[Ink wash painting|Chinese ink painting]] and drawing with him was one of her first art encounters. Ngai also went to many museum exhibitions with her mother as a child.<ref name= \"AI\" />\n\nThe artist's family  moved from place to place often when she was young, which did not allow for lasting friendships and as a result her childhood was a largely solitary one.

It was there that Ngai's creative confidence began to flourish.<ref name=\"Communication Arts\" />\n\nWhen Ngai started thinking about an education in illustration, it was a difficult decision, because the artist and her family believed there was a [[prejudice]] in Asia against art and design.

Often [[bedridden]] with high fevers until the age of six she took to drawing as a way to keep herself entertained.

It was there that Ngai's creative confidence began to flourish.<ref name=\"Communication Arts\" />\n\nWhen Ngai started thinking about an education in illustration, it was a difficult decision, because the artist and her family believed there was a [[prejudice]] in Asia against art and design.
