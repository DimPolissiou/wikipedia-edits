With the Anzac front locked in a tense stalemate, the [[Allies (World War I)|Allies]] had attempted to carry the offensive on the Helles battlefield \u2013 at enormous cost and for little gain. In August, the British command proposed a new operation to reinvigorate the campaign by capturing the Sari Bair ridge, the high ground that dominated the middle of the Gallipoli peninsula above the Anzac landing.\n\nThe main operation started on 6 August with a fresh landing {{convert|5|mi|km}} north of Anzac at [[Suvla Bay]] in conjunction with the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (army corps)|Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]]. The Allies mounted an attack north into the rugged country alongside the Sari Bair range with the aim of capturing the high ground and linking with the Suvla landing.  At Helles, the British and [[France|French]] were now to remain largely on the defensive.\n\n== Background ==\nThe battle should properly be known as the \"Battle of ''Koca\u00e7imentepe''\" which was the correct [[Turkish language|Turkish]] name for the ridge and its highest peak (meaning \"Great Grass Hill\").  The peak was known to the British as \"Hill 971\" and they mistakenly applied the name for a lesser ridge to the main range (''Sar\u0131 Bay\u0131r'', meaning \"Yellow Slope\", which ended at the imposing bluff above [[Anzac Cove]] known as \"The Sphinx\").\n\n== Prelude ==\nFor this offensive the commander of the [[Mediterranean Expeditionary Force]], General [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton|Sir Ian Hamilton]], was provided with three British [[Kitchener's Army|New Army]] divisions; the [[British 10th (Irish) Division|10th (Irish) Division]], the [[British 11th (Northern) Division|11th (Northern) Division]] and the [[British 13th (Western) Division|13th (Western) Division]] \u2014 all previously untried in [[battle]].  He was later reinforced with two [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] divisions; the [[British 53rd (Welsh) Division|53rd (Welsh) Division]] and the [[British 54th (East Anglian) Division|54th (East Anglian) Division]] and one division of dismounted [[yeomanry]]; the [[2nd Mounted Division]].{{sfn|Bean|1941|p=440}}\n\nThe Suvla landing was to be made by the [[IX Corps (United Kingdom)|British IX Corps]], under the command of [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Frederick Stopford|Sir Frederick Stopford]]{{sfn|Bean|1941|p=467}} who had retired in 1909 and had never commanded men in battle. His appointment was made based solely on seniority{{sfn|Carlyon|2002|pp=334\u2013335}} but his hesitancy during the preparations for the landing should have warned Hamilton that he was not a fit choice for the command.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe Ottomans were well aware that a renewal of the offensive was imminent. There had been some doubt about whether the British would abandon the campaign but this was dispelled when [[Winston Churchill]] made a careless speech in [[Dundee]], stating that the battle would continue, whatever the sacrifices. Consequently, the [[Fifth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Fifth Army]] underwent a reorganisation resulting in an expansion to 16 [[division (military)|divisions]]. Ten of these defended the existing battlefields (six at Helles, which had seen the bulk of the early fighting, and four at Anzac). Three divisions defended the Asian shore of the Dardanelles and three divisions of the [[XVI Corps (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman XVI Corps]] defended the [[Gulf of Saros]] north of [[Bulair]] at the neck of the peninsula.\n\nThe Ottomans anticipated that the offensive would involve a breakout from Anzac but were unsure whether it would be north (towards Suvla) or south (towards [[Gaba Tepe]]). A new British landing was also considered likely but Suvla was not rated highly as a candidate, consequently, only a modest force of four battalions defended the area. The Ottoman commanders also dismissed the possibility of an assault against the Sari Bair range due to the rugged terrain. Only [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]], commander of the [[19th Division (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman 19th Division]] at Anzac, expected the attack against the heights but he was unable to convince his commanding officer, [[Mehmet Esat B\u00fclkat|Esad Pasha]] to significantly strengthen the defenses there. Back in June he had made another attempt, through Captain [[Fahrettin Altay]], then 3. Army chief of staff, to persuade Esad Pasha to beef up defenses further North, but had no result other than raising the ire of his commanding officer.<ref>M. Kemal, \"Anafartalar Muharebatina Ait Tarihce\", Kopernik Kitap (2018), {{ISBN|9752439128}} (collection of communications related to Anafarta battles)</ref> To placate him, only one [[regiment]], 14. was moved to the sector north of Anzac.{{sfn|Cameron|2009|pp=19\u201320}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Anzac breakout ===\n[[File:Battle of Sari Bair, first phase.jpg|thumb|<center>Map of the British attack, 6\u20138 August</center>]]\nThe attack from the Anzac perimeter was directed against two peaks of the Sari Bair range; [[Chunuk Bair]] and Hill 971.{{sfn|Bean|1941|pp=455\u2013456}} Under the overall command of [[Major-General]] [[Alexander Godley]], the attacking force included the [[New Zealand and Australian Division]], the British [[British 13th (Western) Division|13th Division]] plus a couple of extra infantry [[brigade]]s.{{sfn|Bean|1941|p=454}}\n\nThe plan was for two assaulting columns to march out of Anzac on the night of 6 August. The right-hand column, comprising the [[New Zealand Infantry Brigade]] under [[Brigadier-General]] Francis Johnston, would head for Chunuk Bair.{{sfn|Bean|1941|p=459}}  The left-hand column, commanded by Major-General [[Herbert Cox]], heading for Hill 971 and neighbouring Hill Q, contained the [[4th Brigade (Australia)|Australian 4th Infantry Brigade]] of Brigadier-General [[John Monash]] and Cox's [[29th Indian Brigade]].{{sfn|Bean|1941|pp=460\u2013461}} Both objectives were expected to be captured by dawn.{{sfn|Bean|1941|p=463}}\n\nTo distract the Ottomans from the impending offensive, on 6 August, at 5.30 p.m., an attack was made at [[Battle of Lone Pine|Lone Pine]] by the infantry brigades of the [[Australian 1st Division (World War I)|Australian 1st Division]]. While the attack was ultimately successful in capturing the Ottoman trenches, it was counterproductive as a diversion as it attracted reinforcements to the north.  Another costly diversion was carried out at Helles which resulted in a pointless struggle over a patch of ground known as [[Battle of Krithia Vineyard|Krithia Vineyard]].  As was the case at Lone Pine, the British action at Helles did not restrain the Ottomans from sending reinforcements north to the Sari Bair range.\n\nThe right column heading for Chunuk Bair had a simpler navigation task as their route was to some degree visible from the old Anzac perimeter. In what became known as the [[Battle of Chunuk Bair]], the [[Dominion of New Zealand|New Zealanders]] failed to capture the peak by the morning of 7 August but managed the feat on the next morning.\n\n[[File:Battle of Sari Bair, second phase.jpg|thumb|<center>Map of the Turkish counter-attack, 9\u201310 August</center>]]\nOn the morning following the breakout, a number of other attacks were planned within the old Anzac perimeter. The most notorious was the attack of the [[Australian 3rd Light Horse Brigade]] at [[Battle of the Nek|The Nek]] whose slim chance of success had depended on the New Zealanders having captured Chunuk Bair on schedule.\n\nThe left column's journey through the tangled ravines was doomed to failure and, having become lost and confused, it never got close to the objective of Hill 971.  By the morning of 8 August Cox's forces were sufficiently organised to attempt an attack on their original objectives of Hill 971 and Hill Q. However Monash's brigade was still mistaken about its position relative to Hill 971. In fact, by the end of the day's advance Monash's troops had actually reached the position they had believed they had been starting from. Meanwhile, Hill 971 was more unreachable than ever. The three Australian [[battalion]]s that had made the assault suffered 765 casualties \u2014 the [[15th Battalion (Australia)|15th Battalion]] was reduced to about 30 per cent of its normal strength.\n\nOf the force aiming for Hill Q, one battalion of the [[6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles|6th Gurkhas]] commanded by [[Major]] [[Cecil Allanson]] and joined by disparate New Army men, moved to within 200 feet of Hill Q by 6 p.m. on 8 August where they sought shelter from the heavy Ottoman fire.  After a [[naval artillery]] bombardment, the battalion attacked the summit shortly after 5 a.m. on 9 August. The plan of the attack, as concocted by General Godley, had involved numerous other battalions but all were lost or pinned down so the Gurkhas went on alone. They succeeded in driving the Ottomans off the hill but were then caught in further naval gunfire from friendly [[monitor warship type|monitors]] or from an [[artillery battery]] at Anzac. Having suffered heavy casualties and with no reinforcements, Allanson's force was pushed back off the hill shortly afterwards.\n\nBy the end of 9 August the Allies retained only a foothold on Chunuk Bair. On 10 August the Ottomans, led from the front by Colonel Mustafa Kemal, counter-attacked and regained control of the entire Sari Bair ridge.\n\n''See also:'' [[Battle of Krithia Vineyard]] \u2014 [[Battle of Lone Pine]] \u2014 [[Battle of the Nek]] \u2014 [[Battle of Chunuk Bair]]\n\n=== Suvla landing ===\n{{main|Landing at Suvla Bay}}\nStopford's IX Corps comprised the British [[10th Division (British)|10th (Irish)]] and [[11th Division (British)|11th Divisions]]. At the time of the landing on 6 August the British were confronted by three Ottoman battalions under the command of a [[Bavaria]]n [[cavalry]] officer, [[Major]] [[Wilhelm Willmer]] whose task was to delay the British until reinforcements could arrive from Bulair, {{convert|30|mi|km}} away.\n\nStopford, who had decided to command the landings from [[Acacia-class sloop|HMS ''Jonquil'']] that was anchored offshore, slept during the attack instead.<ref>[http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/stopford.htm Biography at firstworldwar.com]</ref> The 11th Division landed on the night of 6 August and two brigades of the 10th Division landed the following morning. The landings, made in the dark without the aid of reliable [[reconnaissance]], suffered from the same confusion that reigned at [[landing at Anzac Cove|Anzac landing]] on 25 April. Lighters ran aground on sandbars so that the troops had to wade some distance to get ashore. Many units became intermingled and officers were unable to locate their objectives. [[Lala Baba]] was captured by the 6th Battalion of the [[Green Howards|Yorkshire Regiment]] in what was the first combat action by any unit of the [[Kitchener's Army|New Army]] of [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener of Khartoum|Lord Kitchener]]. The original objectives were the capture of the ridge lines to the north (Kiretch Tepe) and east (Tekke Tepe) and the line of hills to the south on the Anafarta Spur. Stopford's 'caution' and Hamilton's failure to exert his will on his subordinate commanders, meant the objectives were diluted to little more than securing the beach.\n\nBy evening on 7 August, with the [[chain of command]] breaking down, progress had become minimal. Mostly due to Stopford still \"commanding\" from offshore, however, a lack of supplies, especially drinking water, weren't helping matters. To the south east Chocolate Hill and Green Hill were taken in the evening with minimal resistance but constant harassment by [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] and [[sniper]] fire. The British suffered {{nowrap|1,700 casualties}} on the first day at Suvla.\n\nGeneral Sanders was incensed at commander of the 7th and 12th divisions, Colonel Fevzi Bey, for not taking advantage of the Allied disarray at Suvla and pounce on them before they got organized. Turks not expecting a major landing at Suvla had to rush in the two divisions and Fevzi Bey dreaded night attacks, which were rarely successful.<ref>\"Dirilis\", Turgut Ozakman, Bilgi Yayinevi, 2018, pp. 440\u2013470</ref> Sanders relieved Fevzi Bey immediately and gave the responsibility to [[Mustafa Kemal]] who was the commander of the 19th division. Basically he was given the command of a whole group responsible for the front from Anzac Cove to [[Gulf of Saros|Saros]]. He immediately planned for an attack along the Anafarta Hills. Given his success at Ariburnu earlier in spring, Mustafa Kemal's arrival boosted the Ottoman morale.\n\nThe first serious Allied attempt at the ridges of the Anafarta Hills to the east was made on the night of 8 August, following intervention from Hamilton but on the morning of 9 August, the Ottoman reinforcements had begun to arrive and the British were driven back. The fighting concentrated around [[Scimitar Hill]] which protruded northwards from the Anafarta Spur and dominated the southern approach to the Tekke Tepe ridge. Scimitar Hill had been captured then abandoned on 8 August; attempts to retake the hill on 9 and 10 August, were thwarted by the Ottomans. The gunfire was so intense it set the undergrowth ablaze and many of the wounded were incinerated where they lay.\n\nAs the fighting developed, the landing was reinforced by the arrival of the British [[53rd Division (British)|53rd Division]] on 9 August, followed by the [[54th Division (British)|54th Division]] on 10 August.  Stopford now had four divisions under his corps command but was faced by a similar strength of Ottoman defenders. The 53rd Division was mauled in another attack on Scimitar Hill on 10 August.\n\nOn 15 August, Hamilton sacked Stopford and a number of division and brigade commanders. The command of IX Corps was given to Major-General [[Beauvoir De Lisle]], commander of the [[British 29th Division|29th Division]] until Lieutenant-General [[Julian H.G. Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy|Julian Byng]] could travel from France to assume command.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n===Analysis===\n[[File:Southern Trench in Lone Pine, Gallipoli, 8 August 1915 (Graphic Content) (17797424431).jpg|alt=Southern Trench in Lone Pine, Gallipoli, 8 August 1915|thumb|Southern Trench in Lone Pine, Gallipoli, 8 August 1915]]\nOnce the battles of 21 August had finished, the front lines at Suvla and Anzac remained static for the remainder of the campaign. Localised fighting continued but no more major advances were attempted. Many soldiers suffered or perished due to the hostile conditions they endured as a result of their poor preparation and training. Disease transmitted by mosquitoes and the lack of fresh water and shelter hampered the efforts of the division as the men were too weak to fight to their best ability. The insufficient knowledge had an impact of their advancement as their enemy were more familiar to the terrain and could ambush the division successfully. A combination of factors caused their success to be mixed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Tenth (Irish) Division in Gallipoli|last=1884\u20131930.|first=Cooper, Bryan|date=1993|publisher=Irish Academic Press|isbn=0716525178|location=Dublin, Ireland|oclc=29797013}}</ref>\n\n===Subsequent operations===\n{{main|Battle of Scimitar Hill|Battle of Hill 60 (Gallipoli)}}\n\nAs the shape of the new front line firmed, General Hamilton planned one further attack to try to link the Suvla landing to Anzac. This required the capture of a group of hills; Scimitar Hill and the 'W' Hills from Suvla and Hill 60 from the new Anzac sector. The attacks were to commence on 21 August. At Suvla, de Lisle had his 29th Division and the [[2nd Mounted Division]] which had been moved to Suvla as additional reinforcements.\n\nThe 29th Division was to attack [[Battle of Scimitar Hill|Scimitar Hill]] while the 11th Division was to take the W Hills on the south of the Anafarta Spur. The 2nd Mounted Division was in reserve near Lala Baba on the far side of the salt lake. This attack was the largest mounted by the Allies at Gallipoli. Scimitar Hill was captured briefly but the attackers were driven off or killed by the defensive fire from the Ottomans higher up the spur. Once again the undergrowth ignited, burning many of the wounded. The 2nd Mounted Division were called to join the attack and advanced, marching in extended formation, straight across the salt lake, under fire the whole way. For a second time the hill was captured, briefly, before being lost for the final time.  The attack of the 11th Division towards the W Hills was held up by strong Ottoman defences.\n\nIn the Anzac sector, Hill 60 had been unoccupied on the morning of 7 August, when [[Military history of Australia during World War I|Australian]] scouts passed across but the Ottomans swiftly occupied and fortified the hill. The [[Battle of Hill 60 (Gallipoli)|Battle of Hill 60]] lasted for eight days and while the summit was eventually reached, the Allies were unable to completely dislodge the sacrificially fighting Ottoman defenders.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |ref=\n|series=History of the Great War Based on Official Documents by Direction of the Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence |title=Military Operations Gallipoli: Inception of the Campaign to May 1915 |volume=I |last=Aspinall-Oglander |first=C.

With the Anzac front locked in a tense stalemate, the [[Allies (World War I)|Allies]] had attempted to carry the offensive on the Helles battlefield \u2013 at enormous cost and for little gain. In August, the British command proposed a new operation to reinvigorate the campaign by capturing the Sari Bair ridge, the high ground that dominated the middle of the Gallipoli peninsula above the Anzac landing.\n\nThe main operation started on 6 August with a fresh landing {{convert|5|mi|km}} north of Anzac at [[Suvla Bay]] in conjunction with the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (army corps)|Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]]. The Allies mounted an attack north into the rugged country alongside the Sari Bair range with the aim of capturing the high ground and linking with the Suvla landing.  At Helles, the British and [[France|French]] were now to remain largely on the defensive.\n\n== Background ==\nThe battle should properly be known as the \"Battle of ''Koca\u00e7imentepe''\" which was the correct [[Turkish language|Turkish]] name for the ridge and its highest peak (meaning \"Great Grass Hill\").  The peak was known to the British as \"Hill 971\" and they mistakenly applied the name for a lesser ridge to the main range (''Sar\u0131 Bay\u0131r'', meaning \"Yellow Slope\", which ended at the imposing bluff above [[Anzac Cove]] known as \"The Sphinx\").\n\n== Prelude ==\nFor this offensive the commander of the [[Mediterranean Expeditionary Force]], General [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton|Sir Ian Hamilton]], was provided with three British [[Kitchener's Army|New Army]] divisions; the [[British 10th (Irish) Division|10th (Irish) Division]], the [[British 11th (Northern) Division|11th (Northern) Division]] and the [[British 13th (Western) Division|13th (Western) Division]] \u2014 all previously untried in [[battle]].  He was later reinforced with two [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] divisions; the [[British 53rd (Welsh) Division|53rd (Welsh) Division]] and the [[British 54th (East Anglian) Division|54th (East Anglian) Division]] and one division of dismounted [[yeomanry]]; the [[2nd Mounted Division]].{{sfn|Bean|1941|p=440}}\n\nThe Suvla landing was to be made by the [[IX Corps (United Kingdom)|British IX Corps]], under the command of [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Frederick Stopford|Sir Frederick Stopford]]{{sfn|Bean|1941|p=467}} who had retired in 1909 and had never commanded men in battle. His appointment was made based solely on seniority{{sfn|Carlyon|2002|pp=334\u2013335}} but his hesitancy during the preparations for the landing should have warned Hamilton that he was not a fit choice for the command.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe Ottomans were well aware that a renewal of the offensive was imminent. There had been some doubt about whether the British would abandon the campaign but this was dispelled when [[Winston Churchill]] made a careless speech in [[Dundee]], stating that the battle would continue, whatever the sacrifices. Consequently, the [[Fifth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Fifth Army]] underwent a reorganisation resulting in an expansion to 16 [[division (military)|divisions]]. Ten of these defended the existing battlefields (six at Helles, which had seen the bulk of the early fighting, and four at Anzac). Three divisions defended the Asian shore of the Dardanelles and three divisions of the [[XVI Corps (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman XVI Corps]] defended the [[Gulf of Saros]] north of [[Bulair]] at the neck of the peninsula.\n\nThe Ottomans anticipated that the offensive would involve a breakout from Anzac but were unsure whether it would be north (towards Suvla) or south (towards [[Gaba Tepe]]). A new British landing was also considered likely but Suvla was not rated highly as a candidate, consequently, only a modest force of four battalions defended the area. The Ottoman commanders also dismissed the possibility of an assault against the Sari Bair range due to the rugged terrain. Only [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]], commander of the [[19th Division (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman 19th Division]] at Anzac, expected the attack against the heights but he was unable to convince his commanding officer, [[Mehmet Esat B\u00fclkat|Esad Pasha]] to significantly strengthen the defenses there. Back in June he had made another attempt, through Captain [[Fahrettin Altay]], then 3. Army chief of staff, to persuade Esad Pasha to beef up defenses further North, but had no result other than raising the ire of his commanding officer.<ref>M. Kemal, \"Anafartalar Muharebatina Ait Tarihce\", Kopernik Kitap (2018), {{ISBN|9752439128}} (collection of communications related to Anafarta battles)</ref> To placate him, only one [[regiment]], 14. was moved to the sector north of Anzac.{{sfn|Cameron|2009|pp=19\u201320}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Anzac breakout ===\n[[File:Battle of Sari Bair, first phase.jpg|thumb|<center>Map of the British attack, 6\u20138 August</center>]]\nThe attack from the Anzac perimeter was directed against two peaks of the Sari Bair range; [[Chunuk Bair]] and Hill 971.{{sfn|Bean|1941|pp=455\u2013456}} Under the overall command of [[Major-General]] [[Alexander Godley]], the attacking force included the [[New Zealand and Australian Division]], the British [[British 13th (Western) Division|13th Division]] plus a couple of extra infantry [[brigade]]s.{{sfn|Bean|1941|p=454}}\n\nThe plan was for two assaulting columns to march out of Anzac on the night of 6 August. The right-hand column, comprising the [[New Zealand Infantry Brigade]] under [[Brigadier-General]] Francis Johnston, would head for Chunuk Bair.{{sfn|Bean|1941|p=459}}  The left-hand column, commanded by Major-General [[Herbert Cox]], heading for Hill 971 and neighbouring Hill Q, contained the [[4th Brigade (Australia)|Australian 4th Infantry Brigade]] of Brigadier-General [[John Monash]] and Cox's [[29th Indian Brigade]].{{sfn|Bean|1941|pp=460\u2013461}} Both objectives were expected to be captured by dawn.{{sfn|Bean|1941|p=463}}\n\nTo distract the Ottomans from the impending offensive, on 6 August, at 5.30 p.m., an attack was made at [[Battle of Lone Pine|Lone Pine]] by the infantry brigades of the [[Australian 1st Division (World War I)|Australian 1st Division]]. While the attack was ultimately successful in capturing the Ottoman trenches, it was counterproductive as a diversion as it attracted reinforcements to the north.  Another costly diversion was carried out at Helles which resulted in a pointless struggle over a patch of ground known as [[Battle of Krithia Vineyard|Krithia Vineyard]].  As was the case at Lone Pine, the British action at Helles did not restrain the Ottomans from sending reinforcements north to the Sari Bair range.\n\nThe right column heading for Chunuk Bair had a simpler navigation task as their route was to some degree visible from the old Anzac perimeter. In what became known as the [[Battle of Chunuk Bair]], the [[Dominion of New Zealand|New Zealanders]] failed to capture the peak by the morning of 7 August but managed the feat on the next morning.\n\n[[File:Battle of Sari Bair, second phase.jpg|thumb|<center>Map of the Turkish counter-attack, 9\u201310 August</center>]]\nOn the morning following the breakout, a number of other attacks were planned within the old Anzac perimeter. The most notorious was the attack of the [[Australian 3rd Light Horse Brigade]] at [[Battle of the Nek|The Nek]] whose slim chance of success had depended on the New Zealanders having captured Chunuk Bair on schedule.\n\nThe left column's journey through the tangled ravines was doomed to failure and, having become lost and confused, it never got close to the objective of Hill 971.  By the morning of 8 August Cox's forces were sufficiently organised to attempt an attack on their original objectives of Hill 971 and Hill Q. However Monash's brigade was still mistaken about its position relative to Hill 971. In fact, by the end of the day's advance Monash's troops had actually reached the position they had believed they had been starting from. Meanwhile, Hill 971 was more unreachable than ever. The three Australian [[battalion]]s that had made the assault suffered 765 casualties \u2014 the [[15th Battalion (Australia)|15th Battalion]] was reduced to about 30 per cent of its normal strength.\n\nOf the force aiming for Hill Q, one battalion of the [[6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles|6th Gurkhas]] commanded by [[Major]] [[Cecil Allanson]] and joined by disparate New Army men, moved to within 200 feet of Hill Q by 6 p.m. on 8 August where they sought shelter from the heavy Ottoman fire.  After a [[naval artillery]] bombardment, the battalion attacked the summit shortly after 5 a.m. on 9 August. The plan of the attack, as concocted by General Godley, had involved numerous other battalions but all were lost or pinned down so the Gurkhas went on alone. They succeeded in driving the Ottomans off the hill but were then caught in further naval gunfire from friendly [[monitor warship type|monitors]] or from an [[artillery battery]] at Anzac. Having suffered heavy casualties and with no reinforcements, Allanson's force was pushed back off the hill shortly afterwards.\n\nBy the end of 9 August the Allies retained only a foothold on Chunuk Bair. On 10 August the Ottomans, led from the front by Colonel Mustafa Kemal, counter-attacked and regained control of the entire Sari Bair ridge.\n\n''See Also:'' [[Battle of Krithia Vineyard]] \u2014 [[Battle of Lone Pine]] \u2014 [[Battle of the Nek]] \u2014 [[Battle of Chunuk Bair]]\n\n=== Suvla landing ===\n{{main|Landing at Suvla Bay}}\nStopford's IX Corps comprised the British [[10th Division (British)|10th (Irish)]] and [[11th Division (British)|11th Divisions]]. At the time of the landing on 6 August the British were confronted by three Ottoman battalions under the command of a [[Bavaria]]n [[cavalry]] officer, [[Major]] [[Wilhelm Willmer]] whose task was to delay the British until reinforcements could arrive from Bulair, {{convert|30|mi|km}} away.\n\nStopford, who had decided to command the landings from [[Acacia-class sloop|HMS ''Jonquil'']] that was anchored offshore, slept during the attack instead.<ref>[http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/stopford.htm Biography at firstworldwar.com]</ref> The 11th Division landed on the night of 6 August and two brigades of the 10th Division landed the following morning. The landings, made in the dark without the aid of reliable [[reconnaissance]], suffered from the same confusion that reigned at [[landing at Anzac Cove|Anzac landing]] on 25 April. Lighters ran aground on sandbars so that the troops had to wade some distance to get ashore. Many units became intermingled and officers were unable to locate their objectives. [[Lala Baba]] was captured by the 6th Battalion of the [[Green Howards|Yorkshire Regiment]] in what was the first combat action by any unit of the [[Kitchener's Army|New Army]] of [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener of Khartoum|Lord Kitchener]]. The original objectives were the capture of the ridge lines to the north (Kiretch Tepe) and east (Tekke Tepe) and the line of hills to the south on the Anafarta Spur. Stopford's 'caution' and Hamilton's failure to exert his will on his subordinate commanders, meant the objectives were diluted to little more than securing the beach.\n\nBy evening on 7 August, with the [[chain of command]] breaking down, progress had become minimal. Mostly due to Stopford still \"commanding\" from offshore, however, a lack of supplies, especially drinking water, weren't helping matters. To the south east Chocolate Hill and Green Hill were taken in the evening with minimal resistance but constant harassment by [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] and [[sniper]] fire. The British suffered {{nowrap|1,700 casualties}} on the first day at Suvla.\n\nGeneral Sanders was incensed at commander of the 7th and 12th divisions, Colonel Fevzi Bey, for not taking advantage of the Allied disarray at Suvla and pounce on them before they got organized. Turks not expecting a major landing at Suvla had to rush in the two divisions and Fevzi Bey dreaded night attacks, which were rarely successful.<ref>\"Dirilis\", Turgut Ozakman, Bilgi Yayinevi, 2018, pp. 440\u2013470</ref> Sanders relieved Fevzi Bey immediately and gave the responsibility to [[Mustafa Kemal]] who was the commander of the 19th division. Basically he was given the command of a whole group responsible for the front from Anzac Cove to [[Gulf of Saros|Saros]]. He immediately planned for an attack along the Anafarta Hills. Given his success at Ariburnu earlier in spring, Mustafa Kemal's arrival boosted the Ottoman morale.\n\nThe first serious Allied attempt at the ridges of the Anafarta Hills to the east was made on the night of 8 August, following intervention from Hamilton but on the morning of 9 August, the Ottoman reinforcements had begun to arrive and the British were driven back. The fighting concentrated around [[Scimitar Hill]] which protruded northwards from the Anafarta Spur and dominated the southern approach to the Tekke Tepe ridge. Scimitar Hill had been captured then abandoned on 8 August; attempts to retake the hill on 9 and 10 August, were thwarted by the Ottomans. The gunfire was so intense it set the undergrowth ablaze and many of the wounded were incinerated where they lay.\n\nAs the fighting developed, the landing was reinforced by the arrival of the British [[53rd Division (British)|53rd Division]] on 9 August, followed by the [[54th Division (British)|54th Division]] on 10 August.  Stopford now had four divisions under his corps command but was faced by a similar strength of Ottoman defenders. The 53rd Division was mauled in another attack on Scimitar Hill on 10 August.\n\nOn 15 August, Hamilton sacked Stopford and a number of division and brigade commanders. The command of IX Corps was given to Major-General [[Beauvoir De Lisle]], commander of the [[British 29th Division|29th Division]] until Lieutenant-General [[Julian H.G. Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy|Julian Byng]] could travel from France to assume command.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n===Analysis===\n[[File:Southern Trench in Lone Pine, Gallipoli, 8 August 1915 (Graphic Content) (17797424431).jpg|alt=Southern Trench in Lone Pine, Gallipoli, 8 August 1915|thumb|Southern Trench in Lone Pine, Gallipoli, 8 August 1915]]\nOnce the battles of 21 August had finished, the front lines at Suvla and Anzac remained static for the remainder of the campaign. Localised fighting continued but no more major advances were attempted. Many soldiers suffered or perished due to the hostile conditions they endured as a result of their poor preparation and training. Disease transmitted by mosquitoes and the lack of fresh water and shelter hampered the efforts of the division as the men were too weak to fight to their best ability. The insufficient knowledge had an impact of their advancement as their enemy were more familiar to the terrain and could ambush the division successfully. A combination of factors caused their success to be mixed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Tenth (Irish) Division in Gallipoli|last=1884\u20131930.|first=Cooper, Bryan|date=1993|publisher=Irish Academic Press|isbn=0716525178|location=Dublin, Ireland|oclc=29797013}}</ref>\n\n===Subsequent operations===\n{{main|Battle of Scimitar Hill|Battle of Hill 60 (Gallipoli)}}\n\nAs the shape of the new front line firmed, General Hamilton planned one further attack to try to link the Suvla landing to Anzac. This required the capture of a group of hills; Scimitar Hill and the 'W' Hills from Suvla and Hill 60 from the new Anzac sector. The attacks were to commence on 21 August. At Suvla, de Lisle had his 29th Division and the [[2nd Mounted Division]] which had been moved to Suvla as additional reinforcements.\n\nThe 29th Division was to attack [[Battle of Scimitar Hill|Scimitar Hill]] while the 11th Division was to take the W Hills on the south of the Anafarta Spur. The 2nd Mounted Division was in reserve near Lala Baba on the far side of the salt lake. This attack was the largest mounted by the Allies at Gallipoli. Scimitar Hill was captured briefly but the attackers were driven off or killed by the defensive fire from the Ottomans higher up the spur. Once again the undergrowth ignited, burning many of the wounded. The 2nd Mounted Division were called to join the attack and advanced, marching in extended formation, straight across the salt lake, under fire the whole way. For a second time the hill was captured, briefly, before being lost for the final time.  The attack of the 11th Division towards the W Hills was held up by strong Ottoman defences.\n\nIn the Anzac sector, Hill 60 had been unoccupied on the morning of 7 August, when [[Military history of Australia during World War I|Australian]] scouts passed across but the Ottomans swiftly occupied and fortified the hill. The [[Battle of Hill 60 (Gallipoli)|Battle of Hill 60]] lasted for eight days and while the summit was eventually reached, the Allies were unable to completely dislodge the sacrificially fighting Ottoman defenders.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |ref=\n|series=History of the Great War Based on Official Documents by Direction of the Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence |title=Military Operations Gallipoli: Inception of the Campaign to May 1915 |volume=I |last=Aspinall-Oglander |first=C.

It took place simultaneously with the naval [[Battle of Artemisium|battle at Artemisium]], in August or September 480 BC, at the narrow coastal pass of [[Thermopylae]] (\"The Hot Gates\"). The Persian invasion was a delayed response to the defeat of the [[first Persian invasion of Greece]], which had been ended by the [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] victory at the [[Battle of Marathon]] in 490 BC. By 480 BC Xerxes had amassed a massive army and navy, and set out to conquer all of Greece. The Athenian politician and general [[Themistocles]] had proposed that the allied Greeks block the advance of the Persian army at the pass of Thermopylae, and simultaneously block the Persian navy at the Straits of [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]].\n\nA Greek force of approximately 7,000 men marched north to block the pass in the middle of 480 BC. The Persian army, alleged by the ancient sources to have numbered over one million, but today considered to have been much smaller (various figures are given by scholars, ranging between about 100,000 and 150,000)<ref>{{cite book|last=Sacks|first=Kenneth|title=Understanding Emerson: \"The American scholar\" and his struggle for self-reliance |year=2003|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-09982-8|url=https://archive.org/details/understandingeme0000sack |url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/understandingeme0000sack/page/157 157]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cassin-Scott|first=Jack|title=The Greek and Persian Wars 500-323 B.C. |year=1977|publisher=Osprey|isbn=978-0-85045-271-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=geWUfjew_PEC&pg=PA11|page=11}}</ref> arrived at the pass in late August or early September. The vastly outnumbered Greeks held off the Persians for seven days (including three of battle) before the rear-guard was annihilated in one of history's most famous [[last stand]]s. During two full days of battle, the small force led by Leonidas blocked the only road by which the massive Persian army could pass. After the second day, a local resident named [[Ephialtes of Trachis|Ephialtes]] betrayed the Greeks by revealing a small path used by shepherds. It led the Persians behind the Greek lines. Leonidas, aware that his force was being outflanked, dismissed the bulk of the Greek army and remained to guard their retreat with 300 [[Spartan hoplite|Spartans]] and 700 [[Thespiae|Thespians]], fighting to the death. Others also reportedly remained, including up to 900 [[helots]] and 400 [[Thebes, Greece|Thebans]]; most of these Thebans reportedly surrendered.\n\nThemistocles was in command of the Greek Navy at Artemisium when he received news that the Persians had taken the pass at Thermopylae. Since the Greek strategy required both Thermopylae and Artemisium to be held, given their losses, it was decided to withdraw to [[Salamis Island|Salamis]]. The Persians overran [[Boeotia]] and then captured the evacuated Athens. The Greek fleet\u2014seeking a decisive victory over the Persian armada\u2014attacked and defeated the invaders at the [[Battle of Salamis]] in late 480 BC. Wary of being trapped in Europe, Xerxes withdrew with much of his army to Asia (losing most to starvation and disease), leaving [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]] to attempt to complete the conquest of Greece. However, the following year saw a Greek army decisively defeat the Persians at the [[Battle of Plataea]], thereby ending the Persian invasion.\n\nBoth ancient and modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae as an example of the power of a patriotic army defending its native soil. The performance of the defenders is also used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain as [[force multiplier]]s and has become a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds.\n\n==Sources==\n{{Main|Herodotus}}\nThe primary source for the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] is the Greek historian [[Herodotus]]. The Sicilian historian [[Diodorus Siculus]], writing in the 1st century BC in his ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'', also provides an account of the Greco-Persian wars, partially derived from the earlier Greek historian [[Ephorus]]. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus'.<ref>Diodorus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Diod.+11.28 XI, 28\u201334],</ref> The Greco-Persian Wars are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, [[Ctesias of Cnidus]], and are referred to by other authors, as in [[Aeschylus]] in ''[[The Persians]]''.\n\nArchaeological evidence, such as the [[Serpent Column]] (now in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]]), also supports some of Herodotus' specific claims.<ref>Note to Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.81 IX, 81]</ref> George B.

In 481 BC, Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece requesting \"earth and water\" but very deliberately omitting Athens and Sparta.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.32.1 VII, 32]</ref> Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of city-states met at [[Corinth]] in late autumn of 481 BC,<ref name=VII145>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.145.1 VII, 145]</ref> and a confederate alliance of [[History of Greece|Greek city-states]] was formed. It had the power to send envoys to request assistance and dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points, after joint consultation. This was remarkable for the disjointed and chaotic Greek world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.<ref name = h226>Holland, p. 226</ref>\n\nThe \"congress\" met again in the spring of 480 BC. A [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] delegation suggested that the Greeks could muster in the narrow [[Vale of Tempe]], on the borders of Thessaly, and thereby block Xerxes' advance.<ref name = h248>Holland, pp. 248\u2013249</ref> A force of 10,000 [[hoplite]]s was dispatched to the Vale of Tempe, through which they believed the Persian army would have to pass. However, once there, being warned by [[Alexander I of Macedon]] that the vale could be bypassed through Sarantoporo Pass and that Xerxes' army was overwhelming, the Greeks retreated.<ref name=VII173>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.173.1 VII, 173]</ref> Shortly afterwards, they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont.<ref name = h248/>\n\nThemistocles, therefore, suggested a second strategy to the Greeks: the route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica, and the Peloponnesus) would require Xerxes' army to travel through the very narrow pass of [[Thermopylae]], which could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians.<ref name = h255>Holland, pp. 255\u2013257</ref> Furthermore, to prevent the Persians from bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium.

Herodotus claimed that there were, in total, 2.6 million military personnel, accompanied by an equivalent number of support personnel.<ref name=VII186>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.186 VII, 186]</ref> The poet [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]], who was a near-contemporary, talks of four million; [[Ctesias]] gave 800,000 as the total number of the army that was assembled by Xerxes.<ref name = ctes>{{cite web|url=https://www.livius.org/ct-cz/ctesias/photius_persica2.html|title=Photius' excerpt of Ctesias' Persica|publisher=Livius.org|accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nModern scholars tend to reject the figures given by Herodotus and other ancient sources as unrealistic, resulting from miscalculations or exaggerations on the part of the victors.<ref name = h237>Holland, p. 237</ref> Modern scholarly estimates are generally in the range 120,000\u2013300,000.<ref name=\"Holland, p. 394\">Holland, p. 394.</ref>{{cref|b}} These estimates usually come from studying the logistical capabilities of the Persians in that era, the sustainability of their respective bases of operations, and the overall manpower constraints affecting them. Whatever the real numbers were, however, it is clear that Xerxes was anxious to ensure a successful expedition by mustering an overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea.<ref name=souza>de Souza, p. 41.</ref>\nThe number of Persian troops present at Thermopylae is therefore as uncertain as the number for the total invasion force.

Herodotus agrees with this figure in one passage, quoting an inscription by [[Simonides]] saying there were 4,000 Peloponnesians.<ref name = VII228>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.228.1 VII, 228]</ref> However, elsewhere, in the passage summarized by the above table, Herodotus tallies 3,100 Peloponnesians at Thermopylae before the battle.<ref name = VII202/> Herodotus also reports that at Xerxes' public showing of the dead, \"helots were also there for them to see\",<ref name = VIII25>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.25.1 VIII, 25]</ref> but he does not say how many or in what capacity they served. Thus, the difference between his two figures can be squared by supposing (without proof) that there were 900 helots (three per Spartan) present at the battle.<ref name = \"Macan\">Macan, note to Herodotus VIII, 25</ref> If helots were present at the battle, there is no reason to doubt that they served in their traditional role as armed retainers to individual Spartans. Alternatively, Herodotus' \"missing\" 900 troops might have been [[Perioeci]], and could therefore correspond to Diodorus' 1,000 Lacedemonians.<ref name = \"Macan\"/>\n*The number of Lacedemonians\n:Further confusing the issue is Diodorus' ambiguity about whether his count of 1,000 Lacedemonians included the 300 Spartans. At one point he says: \"Leonidas, when he received the appointment, announced that only one thousand men should follow him on the campaign\".<ref name=dsXI4/> However, he then says: \"There were, then, of the Lacedemonians one thousand, and with them three hundred Spartiates\".<ref name=dsXI4/> It is therefore impossible to be clearer on this point.\n\n[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]' account agrees with that of Herodotus (whom he probably read) except that he gives the number of Locrians, which Herodotus declined to estimate. Residing in the direct path of the Persian advance, they gave all the fighting men they had - according to Pausanias 6,000 men - which added to Herodotus' 5,200 would have given a force of 11,200.<ref>Pausanias [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+10.20.1 X, 20]</ref>\n\nMany modern historians, who usually consider Herodotus more reliable,<ref name=Green>Green, p. 140</ref> add the 1,000 Lacedemonians and the 900 helots to Herodotus' 5,200 to obtain 7,100 or about 7,000 men as a standard number, neglecting Diodorus' Melians and Pausanias' Locrians.<ref>Bradford, p. 106</ref><ref name = russel>Bury, pp. 271\u2013282</ref> However, this is only one approach, and many other combinations are plausible. Furthermore, the numbers changed later on in the battle when most of the army retreated and only approximately 3,000 men remained (300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, 400 Thebans, possibly up to 900 helots, and 1,000 Phocians stationed above the pass, less the casualties sustained in the previous days).<ref name=Green/>\n\n==Strategic and tactical considerations==\n[[File:Nicolo arena battleofthermopylae.svg|thumb|250px|A flow map of the battle]]\nFrom a strategic point of view, by defending Thermopylae, the Greeks were making the best possible use of their forces.<ref name = L248/> As long as they could prevent a further Persian advance into Greece, they had no need to seek a decisive battle and could, thus, remain on the defensive. Moreover, by defending two constricted passages (Thermopylae and Artemisium), the Greeks' inferior numbers became less of a factor.<ref name = L248/> Conversely, for the Persians the problem of supplying such a large army meant they could not remain in the same place for very long.<ref name = h285>Holland, pp. 285\u2013287</ref> The Persians, therefore, had to retreat or advance, and advancing required forcing the pass of Thermopylae.<ref name = h285/>\n\nTactically, the pass at Thermopylae was ideally suited to the Greek style of warfare.<ref name = L248/> A [[hoplite]] [[phalanx formation|phalanx]] could block the narrow pass with ease, with no risk of being outflanked by cavalry. Moreover, in the pass, the phalanx would have been very difficult to assault for the more lightly armed Persian infantry.<ref name = L248/> The major weak point for the Greeks was the mountain track which led across the highland parallel to Thermopylae, that could allow their position to be outflanked. Although probably unsuitable for cavalry, this path could easily be traversed by the Persian infantry (many of whom were versed in [[mountain warfare]]).<ref name = h288>Holland, p 288</ref> Leonidas was made aware of this path by local people from [[Trachis]], and he positioned a detachment of Phocian troops there in order to block this route.<ref name = h262>Holland, pp. 262\u2013264</ref>\n\n===Topography of the battlefield===\n[[File:Thermopylae map 480bc.png|thumb|250px|Map of Thermopylae area with modern shoreline and reconstructed shoreline of 480 BC.]]\n\nIt is often claimed that at the time, the pass of Thermopylae consisted of a track along the shore of the Malian Gulf so narrow that only one chariot could pass through at a time.<ref name=\"VII176\" /> In fact, as noted below, the pass was 100 metres wide, probably wider than the Greeks could have held against the Persian masses. Herodotus reports that the Phocians had improved the defences of the pass by channelling the stream from the hot springs to create a marsh, and it was a causeway across this marsh which was only wide enough for a single chariot to traverse. In a later passage, describing a Gaulish attempt to force the pass, Pausinias states \"The cavalry on both sides proved useless, as the ground at the Pass is not only narrow, but also smooth because of the natural rock, while most of it is slippery owing to its being covered with streams...the losses of the barbarians it was impossible to discover exactly. For the number of them that disappeared beneath the mud was great.\"<ref>http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D10%3Achapter%3D21</ref>\n\nIt is also said that on the southern side of the track stood cliffs that overlooked the pass. However, a glance at any photograph of the pass shows there are no cliffs, only steep slopes covered in thorny bushes and trees. Although no obstacle to individuals, such terrain would not be passable by an army and its baggage train.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nOn the north side of the roadway was the [[Malian Gulf]], into which the land shelved gently. When at a later date, an army of Gauls led by [[Brennus (3rd century BC)|Brennus]] attempted to force the pass, the shallowness of the water gave the Greek fleet great difficulty getting close enough to the fighting to bombard the Gauls with ship-borne missile weapons.\n\nAlong the path itself was a series of three constrictions, or \"gates\" (''pylai''), and at the centre gate a wall that had been erected by the Phocians, in the previous century, to aid in their defence against [[Thessalian]] invasions.<ref name=\"VII176\">Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.176.1 VII, 176]</ref> The name \"Hot Gates\" comes from the [[hot spring]]s that were located there.<ref name=\"VIII201\">Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.201.1 VIII, 201]</ref>\n\nThe terrain of the battlefield was nothing that [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] and his forces were accustomed to. Although coming from a mountainous country, the Persians were not prepared for the real nature of the country they had invaded. The pure ruggedness of this area is caused by torrential downpours for four months of the year, combined with an intense summer season of scorching heat that cracks the ground. Vegetation is scarce and consists of low, thorny shrubs. The hillsides along the pass are covered in thick brush, with some plants reaching {{convert|10|ft|m}} high. With the sea on one side and steep, impassable hills on the other, King Leonidas and his men chose the perfect topographical position to battle the Persian invaders.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Battle For The West: Thermopylae |last=Bradford |first=Ernle |publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company |year=1980 |isbn=0-07-007062-8 |location=New York |pages=68\u201369}}</ref>\n\nToday, the pass is not near the sea, but is several kilometres inland because of [[Sedimentation#Geology|sedimentation]] in the Malian Gulf. The old track appears at the foot of the hills around the plain, flanked by a modern road. Recent [[core sample]]s indicate that the pass was only {{convert|100|m}} wide, and the waters came up to the gates: \"Little do the visitors realize that the battle took place across the road from the monument.\"<ref>Dore, pp. 285\u2013286</ref> The pass still is a natural defensive position to modern armies, and [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] forces in [[World War II]] made a [[Battle of Thermopylae (1941)|defence in 1941]] against the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] invasion metres from the original battlefield.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leonidas.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Battle-of-Thermopylae.pdf |title=1941 Battle of Thermopylae |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=1 August 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n*Maps of the region:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Cities/Thermopylae.jpg |format=JPG |title=Map of Thermopylae |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=26 November 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930030341/http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Cities/Thermopylae.jpg |archivedate=30 September 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://uoregon.edu/~klio/maps/gr/Thermopylae.jpg |title=Map of Thermopylae |publisher=Uoregon.edu |accessdate=26 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524094702/http://uoregon.edu/~klio/maps/gr/Thermopylae.jpg |archive-date=24 May 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*Image of the battlefield, from the east<ref>[https://www.livius.org/pictures/greece/thermopylae/thermopylae-small/]</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n\n===First day===\n[[File:Hoplite circa 500 BCE and Scythian soldier of the Achaemenid army circa 480 BCE enhanced.jpg|thumb|350px|Contemporary depictions: probable [[Spartan]] [[hoplite]] ([[Vix crater]], c.500 BC),<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=Charles |title=Egypt, Greece, and Rome: Civilizations of the Ancient Mediterranean |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199651917 |page=154 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kXIVDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT172 |language=en}}</ref> and [[Scythian]] warrior of the [[Achaemenid army]]<ref name=\"iranicaonline.org\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Naqs-e Rostam \u2013 Encyclopaedia Iranica List of nationalities of the Achaemenid military with corresponding drawings|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/uploads/files/Clothing/v5f7a014_f1_300.jpg |language=en}}</ref> (tomb of [[Xerxes I]], c.480 BC), at the time of the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece]] (480\u2013479 BC).]]\nOn the fifth day after the Persian arrival at Thermopylae and the first day of the battle, Xerxes finally resolved to attack the Greeks.

Herodotus suggests they were brought to the battle as hostages to ensure the good behavior of Thebes.<ref name = VII205/> However, as Plutarch long ago pointed out, if they were hostages, why not send them away with the rest of the Greeks?<ref name = L144/> The likelihood is that these were the Theban \"loyalists\", who unlike the majority of their fellow citizens, objected to Persian domination.<ref name = L144/> They thus probably came to Thermopylae of their own free will and stayed to the end because they could not return to Thebes if the Persians conquered Boeotia.<ref name = h291/> The Thespians, resolved as they were not to submit to Xerxes, faced the destruction of their city if the Persians took Boeotia.<ref name = L144/>\n\nHowever, this alone does not explain the fact that they remained; the remainder of Thespiae was successfully evacuated before the Persians arrived there.<ref name = L144/> It seems that the Thespians volunteered to remain as a simple act of self-sacrifice, all the more amazing since their contingent represented every single hoplite the city could muster.<ref>Lazenby, pp. 259\u2013260</ref> This seems to have been a particularly Thespian trait \u2013 on at least two other occasions in later history, a Thespian force would commit itself to a fight to the death.<ref name = L144/>\n\n[[File:Battle of Thermopylae Spartans and Persians.jpg|thumb|left|Spartans surrounded by Persians, Battle of Thermopylae. 19th century illustration.]]\nAt dawn, Xerxes made [[libation]]s, pausing to allow the Immortals sufficient time to descend the mountain, and then began his advance.<ref name=VII223>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.223.1 VII, 223]</ref> A Persian force of 10,000 men, comprising light infantry and cavalry, charged at the front of the Greek formation.

In Western culture at least, it is the Greeks who are lauded for their performance in battle.<ref name = hxviii>Holland, p. ''xviii''.</ref> However, within the context of the Persian invasion, Thermopylae was undoubtedly a defeat for the Greeks.<ref name=\"Lazenby, p. 151\">Lazenby, p. 151.</ref> It seems clear that the Greek strategy was to hold off the Persians at Thermopylae and Artemisium;<ref name = L248/> whatever they may have intended, it was presumably not their desire to surrender all of Boeotia and Attica to the Persians.<ref name = L248/> The Greek position at Thermopylae, despite being massively outnumbered, was nearly impregnable.<ref name = h294/> If the position had been held for even a little longer, the Persians might have had to retreat for lack of food and water.<ref name = h285/> Thus, despite the heavy losses, forcing the pass was strategically a Persian victory,<ref name = h294/> but the successful retreat of the bulk of the Greek troops was in its own sense a victory as well. The battle itself had shown that even when heavily outnumbered, the Greeks could put up an effective fight against the Persians, and the defeat at Thermopylae had turned Leonidas and the men under his command into martyrs. That boosted the morale of all Greek soldiers in the second Persian invasion.<ref name = h294/>\n\nIt is sometimes stated that Thermopylae was a [[Pyrrhic victory]] for the Persians<ref name=\"Tung & Tung, p. 239\">Tung & Tung, p. 239.</ref><ref name=\"Marozzi, p. 74\">Marozzi, p. 74.</ref> (i.e., one in which the victor is as damaged by the battle as the defeated party). However, there is no suggestion by Herodotus that the effect on the Persian forces was that. The idea ignores the fact that the Persians would, in the aftermath of Thermopylae, conquer the majority of Greece,<ref name = Cawk105>Cawkwell, pp. 105\u2013106</ref> and the fact that they were still fighting in Greece a year later.<ref name = IX1>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.1.1 IX, 1]</ref> Alternatively, the argument is sometimes advanced that the last stand at Thermopylae was a successful delaying action that gave the Greek navy time to prepare for the Battle of Salamis.{{cref|c}} However, compared to the probable time (about one month) between Thermopylae and Salamis, the time bought was negligible.<ref name = hnet>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/greco-persian-wars-battle-of-thermopylae.htm/6 |title=Greco-Persian Wars: Battle of Thermopylae |publisher=HistoryNet |accessdate=27 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090228234109/http://www.historynet.com/greco-persian-wars-battle-of-thermopylae.htm/6| archivedate= 28 February 2009 | url-status=live}}</ref> Furthermore, this idea also neglects the fact that a Greek navy was fighting at Artemisium during the Battle of Thermopylae, incurring losses in the process.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.1.1 VIII, 1\u201319]</ref> [[George Cawkwell]] suggests that the gap between Thermopylae and Salamis was caused by Xerxes' systematically reducing Greek opposition in Phocis and Boeotia, and not as a result of the Battle of Thermopylae; thus, as a delaying action, Thermopylae was insignificant compared to Xerxes' own procrastination.<ref name = Cawk105/> Far from labelling Thermopylae as a Pyrrhic victory, modern academic treatises on the Greco-Persian Wars tend to emphasise the success of Xerxes in breaching the formidable Greek position and the subsequent conquest of the majority of Greece. For instance, Cawkwell states: \"he was successful on both land and sea, and the Great Invasion began with a brilliant success.\n... Xerxes had every reason to congratulate himself\",<ref>Cawkwell, p. 104.</ref> while Lazenby describes the Greek defeat as \"disastrous\".<ref name=\"Lazenby, p. 151\"/>\n\nThe fame of Thermopylae is thus principally derived not from its effect on the outcome of the war but for the inspirational example it set.<ref name = hnet/><ref>Lazenby, p. 150</ref> Thermopylae is famous because of the heroism of the doomed rearguard, who, despite facing certain death, remained at the pass.<ref name=\"hxviii\"/> Ever since, the events of Thermopylae have been the source of effusive praise from many sources: \"Salamis, Plataea, Mycale and Sicily are the fairest sister-victories which the Sun has ever seen, yet they would never dare to compare their combined glory with the glorious defeat of King Leonidas and his men\".<ref>Michel de Montaigne, quoted in Holland, p. ''xviii''.</ref> A second reason is the example it set of free men, fighting for their country and their freedom:\n\n<blockquote>So almost immediately, contemporary Greeks saw Thermopylae as a critical moral and culture lesson. In universal terms, a small, free people had willingly outfought huge numbers of imperial subjects who advanced under the lash. More specifically, the Western idea that soldiers themselves decide where, how, and against whom they will fight was contrasted against the Eastern notion of despotism and monarchy\u2014freedom proving the stronger idea as the more courageous fighting of the Greeks at Thermopylae, and their later victories at Salamis and Plataea attested.<ref name=\"hanson\">{{cite web|url=http://www.victorhanson.com/articles/hanson101106.html |title=Victor Hanson article |publisher=Victor Hanson article |date=11 October 2006 |accessdate=27 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319045718/http://www.victorhanson.com/articles/hanson101106.html |archivedate=19 March 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref></blockquote> While this paradigm of \"free men\" outfighting \"slaves\" can be seen as a rather sweeping over-generalization (there are many counter-examples), it is nevertheless true that many commentators have used Thermopylae to illustrate this point.<ref name = L248>Lazenby, pp. 248\u2013253</ref>\n\nMilitarily, although the battle was actually not decisive in the context of the Persian invasion, Thermopylae is of some significance on the basis of the first two days of fighting.

Greek epitaphs often appealed to the passing reader (always called 'stranger') for sympathy, but the epitaph for the dead Spartans at Thermopylae took this convention much further than usual, asking the reader to make a personal journey to Sparta to break the news that the Spartan expeditionary force had been wiped out. The stranger is also asked to stress that the Spartans died 'fulfilling their orders'.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!'''Translation'''\n!'''Notes'''\n|+\n|-\n|Go tell the Spartans, thou who passest by,<br />That here, obedient to their laws, we lie.<ref>Strachey, p. 481</ref>\n|[[William Lisle Bowles]]\n|-\n|Stranger, tell the Spartans that we behaved <br />as they would wish us to, and are buried here.<ref>Golding, exceprt from The Hot Gates.</ref>\n|[[William Golding]]\n|-\n|Stranger!

Under the statue, a sign reads: \"In memory of the seven hundred Thespians.\"\n\nA plate below the statue explains its symbolism:\n* The headless male figure symbolizes the anonymous sacrifice of the 700 Thespians to their country.\n* The outstretched chest symbolizes the struggle, the gallantry, the strength, the bravery and the courage.\n* The open wing symbolizes the victory, the glory, the soul, the spirit and the freedom.\n* The broken wing symbolizes the voluntary sacrifice and death.\n* The naked body symbolizes Eros, the most important god of the ancient Thespians, a god of creation, beauty and life.\n\nThe monument to the Thespians is placed beside the one to the Spartans.\n\n===Associated legends===\n[[File:The Battle of Thermopylae engraving.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''The Battle of Thermopylae'', 19th century engraving]]\nHerodotus' colorful account of the battle has provided history with many apocryphal incidents and conversations away from the main historical events. These accounts are obviously not verifiable, but they form an integral part of the legend of the battle and often demonstrate the [[laconic]] speech (and wit) of the Spartans to good effect.\n\nFor instance, [[Plutarch]] recounts, in his ''Sayings of Spartan Women'', upon his departure, Leonidas' wife [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Gorgo]] asked what she should do if he did not return, to which Leonidas replied, \"Marry a good man and have good children.\"<ref>Plutarch, Apophthegmata Laconica [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0197%3Achapter%3D51%3Asection%3D2 Plut. Apoph. 51.2] and Moralia, 240 E (6)</ref>\n\nIt is reported that, upon arriving at Thermopylae, the Persians sent a mounted scout to reconnoitre. The Greeks allowed him to come up to the camp, observe them, and depart. Xerxes found the scout's reports of the size of the Greek force, and that the Spartans were indulging in [[calisthenics|callisthenics]] and combing their long hair, laughable. Seeking the counsel of [[Demaratus]], an exiled Spartan king in his retinue, Xerxes was told the Spartans were preparing for battle, and it was their custom to adorn their hair when they were about to risk their lives. Demaratus called them \"the bravest men in Greece\" and warned the Great King they intended to dispute the pass. He emphasized that he had tried to warn Xerxes earlier in the campaign, but the king had refused to believe him. He added that if Xerxes ever managed to subdue the Spartans, \"there is no other nation in all the world which will venture to lift a hand in their defence.\"<ref name=VII209>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.209.1 VII, 209]</ref>\n\nHerodotus also describes Leonidas' reception of a Persian embassy. The ambassador told Leonidas that Xerxes would offer him the kingship of all Greece if he joined with Xerxes. Leonidas answered: \"If you had any knowledge of the noble things of life, you would refrain from coveting others' possessions; but for me to die for Greece is better than to be the sole ruler over the people of my race.\"<ref>Plutarch, Moralia, 225, saying 10</ref> Then the ambassador asked him more forcefully to surrender their arms. To this Leonidas gave his famous answer: {{lang|grc|[[Molon labe|\u039c\u03bf\u03bb\u1f7c\u03bd \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03ad]]}} (pronounced {{IPA-el|mo\u02c8l\u0254\u02d0n la\u02c8be}}) \"Come and get them.\"<ref>Plutarch, Apophthegmata Laconica, Saying 11.</ref>\n\nSuch laconic bravery doubtlessly helped to maintain morale. Herodotus writes that when [[Dienekes]], a Spartan soldier, was informed that Persian arrows would be so numerous as \"to block out the sun\", he retorted, \"So much the better...then we shall fight our battle in the shade.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.226.1|title=Herodotus,  The Histories, Book 7, chapter 226, section 1|publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu|accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter the battle, Xerxes was curious as to what the Greeks had been trying to do (presumably because they had had so few men) and had some Arcadian deserters interrogated in his presence. The answer was: all the other men were participating in the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]. When Xerxes asked what the prize was for the winner, the answer was: \"an olive-wreath\". Upon hearing this, [[Tigranes]], a Persian general, said: \"Good heavens, [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]], what kind of men are these that you have pitted against us? It is not for riches that they contend but for honour!\" (Godley translation) or otherwise, \"Ye Gods, Mardonius, what men have you brought us to fight against?

The battle is revisited in countless [[adage]]s and works of popular culture, such as in films (e.g., ''[[The 300 Spartans]]'' (1962) and ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' (2007), based on the events during and close to the time of the battle), in literature, in song, in television programs, and in video games. The battle is also discussed in many [[Article (publishing)|articles]] and books on the theory and practice of warfare.\n\n{{main|Sparta in popular culture}}\nPrior to the battle, the [[Hellenes]] remembered the [[Dorians]], an ethnic distinction which applied to the [[Sparta]]ns, as the conquerors and displacers of the [[Ionians]] in the [[Peloponnesus]]. After the battle, Spartan culture became an inspiration and object of emulation, a phenomenon known as [[Laconophilia]].\n\n===Commemoration===\nGreece has announced two commemorative coins to mark 2500 years since the historic battle.<ref name=GR>{{cite web |url=https://greece.greekreporter.com/2020/02/03/greece-issues-commemorative-coins-for-2500th-anniversary-of-battle-of-thermopylae/ |title=Greece Issues Commemorative Coins for 2500th Anniversary of Battle of Thermopylae |last=Kampouris |first=Nick |date=2020-02-03 |website=Greek Reporter |access-date=2020-02-09 |quote=Greece will soon issue two commemorative coins to mark 2500 years since the historic battle of Thermopylae, fought in 480 BC.}}</ref>  While this anniversary will take place in 2021, the coins show the dates 2020 and 480&nbsp;BC and the text \"2,500 years since the Battle of Thermopylae.\"\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY \"CULTURAL\" INFORMATION IN THIS ARTICLE -->\n\n==Analogues==\nThere are several analogous battles.\n\n[[File:2persian gate wall.JPG|thumb|The [[Persian Gates]] narrow pass]]\nSimilarities between the Battle of Thermopylae and the [[Battle of Persian Gate]] have been recognized by both ancient and modern authors,<ref>W.

It took place simultaneously with the naval [[Battle of Artemisium|battle at Artemisium]], in August or September 480 BC, at the narrow coastal pass of [[Thermopylae]] (\"The Hot Gates\"). The Persian invasion was a delayed response to the defeat of the [[first Persian invasion of Greece]], which had been ended by the [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] victory at the [[Battle of Marathon]] in 490 BC. By 480 BC Xerxes had amassed a massive army and navy, and set out to conquer all of Greece. The Athenian politician and general [[Themistocles]] had proposed that the allied Greeks block the advance of the Persian army at the pass of Thermopylae, and simultaneously block the Persian navy at the Straits of [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]].\n\nA Greek force of approximately 7,000 men marched north to block the pass in the middle of 480 BC. The Persian army, alleged by the ancient sources to have numbered over one million, but today considered to have been much smaller (various figures are given by scholars, ranging between about 100,000 and 150,000)<ref>{{cite book|last=Sacks|first=Kenneth|title=Understanding Emerson: \"The American scholar\" and his struggle for self-reliance |year=2003|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-09982-8|url=https://archive.org/details/understandingeme0000sack |url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/understandingeme0000sack/page/157 157]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cassin-Scott|first=Jack|title=The Greek and Persian Wars 500-323 B.C. |year=1977|publisher=Osprey|isbn=978-0-85045-271-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=geWUfjew_PEC&pg=PA11|page=11}}</ref> arrived at the pass in late August or early September. The vastly outnumbered Greeks held off the Persians for seven days (including three of battle) before the rear-guard was annihilated in one of history's most famous [[last stand]]s. During two full days of battle, the small force led by Leonidas blocked the only road by which the massive Persian army could pass. After the second day, a local resident named [[Ephialtes of Trachis|Ephialtes]] betrayed the Greeks by revealing a small path used by shepherds. It led the Persians behind the Greek lines. Leonidas, aware that his force was being outflanked, dismissed the bulk of the Greek army and remained to guard their retreat with 300 [[Spartan hoplite|Spartans]] and 700 [[Thespiae|Thespians]], fighting to the death. Others also reportedly remained, including up to 900 [[helots]] and 400 [[Thebes, Greece|Thebans]]; most of these Thebans reportedly surrendered.\n\nThemistocles was in command of the Greek Navy at Artemisium when he received news that the Persians had taken the pass at Thermopylae. Since the Greek strategy required both Thermopylae and Artemisium to be held, given their losses, it was decided to withdraw to [[Salamis Island|Salamis]]. The Persians overran [[Boeotia]] and then captured the evacuated Athens. The Greek fleet\u2014seeking a decisive victory over the Persian armada\u2014attacked and defeated the invaders at the [[Battle of Salamis]] in late 480 BC. Wary of being trapped in Europe, Xerxes withdrew with much of his army to Asia (losing most to starvation and disease), leaving [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]] to attempt to complete the conquest of Greece. However, the following year saw a Greek army decisively defeat the Persians at the [[Battle of Plataea]], thereby ending the Persian invasion.\n\nBoth ancient and modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae as an example of the power of a patriotic army defending its native soil. The performance of the defenders is also used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain as [[force multiplier]]s and has become a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds.\n\n==Sources==\n{{Main|Herodotus}}\nThe primary source for the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] is the Greek historian [[Herodotus]]. The Sicilian historian [[Diodorus Siculus]], writing in the 1st century BC in his ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'', also provides an account of the Greco-Persian wars, partially derived from the earlier Greek historian [[Ephorus]]. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus'.<ref>Diodorus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Diod.+11.28 XI, 28\u201334],</ref> The Greco-Persian Wars are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, [[Ctesias of Cnidus]], and are referred to by other authors, as in [[Aeschylus]] in ''[[The Persians]]''.\n\nArchaeological evidence, such as the [[Serpent Column]] (now in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]]), also supports some of Herodotus' specific claims.<ref>Note to Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.81 IX, 81]</ref> George B. Grundy was the first modern historian to do a thorough topographical survey of the narrow pass at Thermopylae, and to the extent that modern accounts of the battle differ from Herodotus' they usually follow Grundy's.<ref>''The Great Persian War and its Preliminaries; A Study of the Evidence, Literary and Topographical'', George B.

In 481 BC, Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece requesting \"earth and water\" but very deliberately omitting Athens and Sparta.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.32.1 VII, 32]</ref> Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of city-states met at [[Corinth]] in late autumn of 481 BC,<ref name=VII145>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.145.1 VII, 145]</ref> and a confederate alliance of [[History of Greece|Greek city-states]] was formed. It had the power to send envoys to request assistance and dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points, after joint consultation. This was remarkable for the disjointed and chaotic Greek world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.<ref name = h226>Holland, p. 226</ref>\n\nThe \"congress\" met again in the spring of 480 BC. A [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] delegation suggested that the Greeks could muster in the narrow [[Vale of Tempe]], on the borders of Thessaly, and thereby block Xerxes' advance.<ref name = h248>Holland, pp. 248\u2013249</ref> A force of 10,000 [[hoplite]]s was dispatched to the Vale of Tempe, through which they believed the Persian army would have to pass. However, once there, being warned by [[Alexander I of Macedon]] that the vale could be bypassed through Sarantoporo Pass and that Xerxes' army was overwhelming, the Greeks retreated.<ref name=VII173>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.173.1 VII, 173]</ref> Shortly afterwards, they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont.<ref name = h248/>\n\nThemistocles, therefore, suggested a second strategy to the Greeks: the route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica, and the Peloponnesus) would require Xerxes' army to travel through the very narrow pass of [[Thermopylae]], which could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians.<ref name = h255>Holland, pp. 255\u2013257</ref> Furthermore, to prevent the Persians from bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. Congress adopted this dual-pronged strategy.<ref name = h255/> However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the [[Isthmus of Corinth]], should it come to that, whilst the women and children of Athens would evacuate ''en masse'' to the Peloponnesian city of [[Troezen]].<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.40.1 VIII, 40]</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\n[[File:Thermopylae & Artemisium campaign map.png|thumb|350px|right|Map showing Greek and Persian advances to [[Thermopylae]] and [[Artemisium]]]]\nThe Persian army seems to have made slow progress through Thrace and Macedon.

Herodotus claimed that there were, in total, 2.6 million military personnel, accompanied by an equivalent number of support personnel.<ref name=VII186>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.186 VII, 186]</ref> The poet [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]], who was a near-contemporary, talks of four million; [[Ctesias]] gave 800,000 as the total number of the army that was assembled by Xerxes.<ref name = ctes>{{cite web|url=https://www.livius.org/ct-cz/ctesias/photius_persica2.html|title=Photius' excerpt of Ctesias' Persica|publisher=Livius.org|accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nModern scholars tend to reject the figures given by Herodotus and other ancient sources as unrealistic, resulting from miscalculations or exaggerations on the part of the victors.<ref name = h237>Holland, p. 237</ref> Modern scholarly estimates are generally in the range 120,000\u2013300,000.<ref name=\"Holland, p. 394\">Holland, p. 394.</ref>{{cref|b}} These estimates usually come from studying the logistical capabilities of the Persians in that era, the sustainability of their respective bases of operations, and the overall manpower constraints affecting them. Whatever the real numbers were, however, it is clear that Xerxes was anxious to ensure a successful expedition by mustering an overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea.<ref name=souza>de Souza, p. 41.</ref>\nThe number of Persian troops present at Thermopylae is therefore as uncertain as the number for the total invasion force.

Herodotus agrees with this figure in one passage, quoting an inscription by [[Simonides]] saying there were 4,000 Peloponnesians.<ref name = VII228>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.228.1 VII, 228]</ref> However, elsewhere, in the passage summarized by the above table, Herodotus tallies 3,100 Peloponnesians at Thermopylae before the battle.<ref name = VII202/> Herodotus also reports that at Xerxes' public showing of the dead, \"helots were also there for them to see\",<ref name = VIII25>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.25.1 VIII, 25]</ref> but he does not say how many or in what capacity they served. Thus, the difference between his two figures can be squared by supposing (without proof) that there were 900 helots (three per Spartan) present at the battle.<ref name = \"Macan\">Macan, note to Herodotus VIII, 25</ref> If helots were present at the battle, there is no reason to doubt that they served in their traditional role as armed retainers to individual Spartans. Alternatively, Herodotus' \"missing\" 900 troops might have been [[Perioeci]], and could therefore correspond to Diodorus' 1,000 Lacedemonians.<ref name = \"Macan\"/>\n*The number of Lacedemonians\n:Further confusing the issue is Diodorus' ambiguity about whether his count of 1,000 Lacedemonians included the 300 Spartans. At one point he says: \"Leonidas, when he received the appointment, announced that only one thousand men should follow him on the campaign\".<ref name=dsXI4/> However, he then says: \"There were, then, of the Lacedemonians one thousand, and with them three hundred Spartiates\".<ref name=dsXI4/> It is therefore impossible to be clearer on this point.\n\n[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]' account agrees with that of Herodotus (whom he probably read) except that he gives the number of Locrians, which Herodotus declined to estimate. Residing in the direct path of the Persian advance, they gave all the fighting men they had - according to Pausanias 6,000 men - which added to Herodotus' 5,200 would have given a force of 11,200.<ref>Pausanias [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+10.20.1 X, 20]</ref>\n\nMany modern historians, who usually consider Herodotus more reliable,<ref name=Green>Green, p. 140</ref> add the 1,000 Lacedemonians and the 900 helots to Herodotus' 5,200 to obtain 7,100 or about 7,000 men as a standard number, neglecting Diodorus' Melians and Pausanias' Locrians.<ref>Bradford, p. 106</ref><ref name = russel>Bury, pp. 271\u2013282</ref> However, this is only one approach, and many other combinations are plausible. Furthermore, the numbers changed later on in the battle when most of the army retreated and only approximately 3,000 men remained (300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, 400 Thebans, possibly up to 900 helots, and 1,000 Phocians stationed above the pass, less the casualties sustained in the previous days).<ref name=Green/>\n\n==Strategic and tactical considerations==\n[[File:Nicolo arena battleofthermopylae.svg|thumb|250px|A flow map of the battle]]\nFrom a strategic point of view, by defending Thermopylae, the Greeks were making the best possible use of their forces.<ref name = L248/> As long as they could prevent a further Persian advance into Greece, they had no need to seek a decisive battle and could, thus, remain on the defensive. Moreover, by defending two constricted passages (Thermopylae and Artemisium), the Greeks' inferior numbers became less of a factor.<ref name = L248/> Conversely, for the Persians the problem of supplying such a large army meant they could not remain in the same place for very long.<ref name = h285>Holland, pp. 285\u2013287</ref> The Persians, therefore, had to retreat or advance, and advancing required forcing the pass of Thermopylae.<ref name = h285/>\n\nTactically, the pass at Thermopylae was ideally suited to the Greek style of warfare.<ref name = L248/> A [[hoplite]] [[phalanx formation|phalanx]] could block the narrow pass with ease, with no risk of being outflanked by cavalry. Moreover, in the pass, the phalanx would have been very difficult to assault for the more lightly armed Persian infantry.<ref name = L248/> The major weak point for the Greeks was the mountain track which led across the highland parallel to Thermopylae, that could allow their position to be outflanked. Although probably unsuitable for cavalry, this path could easily be traversed by the Persian infantry (many of whom were versed in [[mountain warfare]]).<ref name = h288>Holland, p 288</ref> Leonidas was made aware of this path by local people from [[Trachis]], and he positioned a detachment of Phocian troops there in order to block this route.<ref name = h262>Holland, pp. 262\u2013264</ref>\n\n===Topography of the battlefield===\n[[File:Thermopylae map 480bc.png|thumb|250px|Map of Thermopylae area with modern shoreline and reconstructed shoreline of 480 BC.]]\n\nIt is often claimed that at the time, the pass of Thermopylae consisted of a track along the shore of the Malian Gulf so narrow that only one chariot could pass through at a time.<ref name=\"VII176\" /> In fact, as noted below, the pass was 100 metres wide, probably wider than the Greeks could have held against the Persian masses. Herodotus reports that the Phocians had improved the defences of the pass by channelling the stream from the hot springs to create a marsh, and it was a causeway across this marsh which was only wide enough for a single chariot to traverse. In a later passage, describing a Gaulish attempt to force the pass, Pausinias states \"The cavalry on both sides proved useless, as the ground at the Pass is not only narrow, but also smooth because of the natural rock, while most of it is slippery owing to its being covered with streams...the losses of the barbarians it was impossible to discover exactly. For the number of them that disappeared beneath the mud was great.\"<ref>http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D10%3Achapter%3D21</ref>\n\nIt is also said that on the southern side of the track stood cliffs that overlooked the pass. However, a glance at any photograph of the pass shows there are no cliffs, only steep slopes covered in thorny bushes and trees. Although no obstacle to individuals, such terrain would not be passable by an army and its baggage train.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nOn the north side of the roadway was the [[Malian Gulf]], into which the land shelved gently. When at a later date, an army of Gauls led by [[Brennus (3rd century BC)|Brennus]] attempted to force the pass, the shallowness of the water gave the Greek fleet great difficulty getting close enough to the fighting to bombard the Gauls with ship-borne missile weapons.\n\nAlong the path itself was a series of three constrictions, or \"gates\" (''pylai''), and at the centre gate a wall that had been erected by the Phocians, in the previous century, to aid in their defence against [[Thessalian]] invasions.<ref name=\"VII176\">Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.176.1 VII, 176]</ref> The name \"Hot Gates\" comes from the [[hot spring]]s that were located there.<ref name=\"VIII201\">Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.201.1 VIII, 201]</ref>\n\nThe terrain of the battlefield was nothing that [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] and his forces were accustomed to. Although coming from a mountainous country, the Persians were not prepared for the real nature of the country they had invaded. The pure ruggedness of this area is caused by torrential downpours for four months of the year, combined with an intense summer season of scorching heat that cracks the ground. Vegetation is scarce and consists of low, thorny shrubs. The hillsides along the pass are covered in thick brush, with some plants reaching {{convert|10|ft|m}} high. With the sea on one side and steep, impassable hills on the other, King Leonidas and his men chose the perfect topographical position to battle the Persian invaders.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Battle For The West: Thermopylae |last=Bradford |first=Ernle |publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company |year=1980 |isbn=0-07-007062-8 |location=New York |pages=68\u201369}}</ref>\n\nToday, the pass is not near the sea, but is several kilometres inland because of [[Sedimentation#Geology|sedimentation]] in the Malian Gulf. The old track appears at the foot of the hills around the plain, flanked by a modern road.

While many of the Greeks took him up on his offer and fled, around two thousand soldiers stayed behind to fight and die.

Many of the Greek contingents then either chose to withdraw (without orders) or were ordered to leave by Leonidas (Herodotus admits that there is some doubt about which actually happened).<ref name = VII219>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.219.1 VII, 219]</ref><ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.220.1 VII, 220]</ref> The contingent of 700 [[Thespiae|Thespians]], led by their general [[Demophilus (Thespiae)|Demophilus]], refused to leave and committed themselves to the fight.<ref name=VII222>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.222.1 VII, 222]</ref> Also present were the 400 Thebans and probably the [[helot]]s who had accompanied the Spartans.<ref name = h291/>\n\nLeonidas' actions have been the subject of much discussion.

In Western culture at least, it is the Greeks who are lauded for their performance in battle.<ref name = hxviii>Holland, p. ''xviii''.</ref> However, within the context of the Persian invasion, Thermopylae was undoubtedly a defeat for the Greeks.<ref name=\"Lazenby, p. 151\">Lazenby, p. 151.</ref> It seems clear that the Greek strategy was to hold off the Persians at Thermopylae and Artemisium;<ref name = L248/> whatever they may have intended, it was presumably not their desire to surrender all of Boeotia and Attica to the Persians.<ref name = L248/> The Greek position at Thermopylae, despite being massively outnumbered, was nearly impregnable.<ref name = h294/> If the position had been held for even a little longer, the Persians might have had to retreat for lack of food and water.<ref name = h285/> Thus, despite the heavy losses, forcing the pass was strategically a Persian victory,<ref name = h294/> but the successful retreat of the bulk of the Greek troops was in its own sense a victory as well. The battle itself had shown that even when heavily outnumbered, the Greeks could put up an effective fight against the Persians, and the defeat at Thermopylae had turned Leonidas and the men under his command into martyrs. That boosted the morale of all Greek soldiers in the second Persian invasion.<ref name = h294/>\n\nIt is sometimes stated that Thermopylae was a [[Pyrrhic victory]] for the Persians<ref name=\"Tung & Tung, p. 239\">Tung & Tung, p. 239.</ref><ref name=\"Marozzi, p. 74\">Marozzi, p. 74.</ref> (i.e., one in which the victor is as damaged by the battle as the defeated party). However, there is no suggestion by Herodotus that the effect on the Persian forces was that. The idea ignores the fact that the Persians would, in the aftermath of Thermopylae, conquer the majority of Greece,<ref name = Cawk105>Cawkwell, pp. 105\u2013106</ref> and the fact that they were still fighting in Greece a year later.<ref name = IX1>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.1.1 IX, 1]</ref> Alternatively, the argument is sometimes advanced that the last stand at Thermopylae was a successful delaying action that gave the Greek navy time to prepare for the Battle of Salamis.{{cref|c}} However, compared to the probable time (about one month) between Thermopylae and Salamis, the time bought was negligible.<ref name = hnet>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/greco-persian-wars-battle-of-thermopylae.htm/6 |title=Greco-Persian Wars: Battle of Thermopylae |publisher=HistoryNet |accessdate=27 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090228234109/http://www.historynet.com/greco-persian-wars-battle-of-thermopylae.htm/6| archivedate= 28 February 2009 | url-status=live}}</ref> Furthermore, this idea also neglects the fact that a Greek navy was fighting at Artemisium during the Battle of Thermopylae, incurring losses in the process.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.1.1 VIII, 1\u201319]</ref> [[George Cawkwell]] suggests that the gap between Thermopylae and Salamis was caused by Xerxes' systematically reducing Greek opposition in Phocis and Boeotia, and not as a result of the Battle of Thermopylae; thus, as a delaying action, Thermopylae was insignificant compared to Xerxes' own procrastination.<ref name = Cawk105/> Far from labelling Thermopylae as a Pyrrhic victory, modern academic treatises on the Greco-Persian Wars tend to emphasise the success of Xerxes in breaching the formidable Greek position and the subsequent conquest of the majority of Greece. For instance, Cawkwell states: \"he was successful on both land and sea, and the Great Invasion began with a brilliant success.\n... Xerxes had every reason to congratulate himself\",<ref>Cawkwell, p. 104.</ref> while Lazenby describes the Greek defeat as \"disastrous\".<ref name=\"Lazenby, p. 151\"/>\n\nThe fame of Thermopylae is thus principally derived not from its effect on the outcome of the war but for the inspirational example it set.<ref name = hnet/><ref>Lazenby, p. 150</ref> Thermopylae is famous because of the heroism of the doomed rearguard, who, despite facing certain death, remained at the pass.<ref name=\"hxviii\"/> Ever since, the events of Thermopylae have been the source of effusive praise from many sources: \"Salamis, Plataea, Mycale and Sicily are the fairest sister-victories which the Sun has ever seen, yet they would never dare to compare their combined glory with the glorious defeat of King Leonidas and his men\".<ref>Michel de Montaigne, quoted in Holland, p. ''xviii''.</ref> A second reason is the example it set of free men, fighting for their country and their freedom:\n\n<blockquote>So almost immediately, contemporary Greeks saw Thermopylae as a critical moral and culture lesson. In universal terms, a small, free people had willingly outfought huge numbers of imperial subjects who advanced under the lash. More specifically, the Western idea that soldiers themselves decide where, how, and against whom they will fight was contrasted against the Eastern notion of despotism and monarchy\u2014freedom proving the stronger idea as the more courageous fighting of the Greeks at Thermopylae, and their later victories at Salamis and Plataea attested.<ref name=\"hanson\">{{cite web|url=http://www.victorhanson.com/articles/hanson101106.html |title=Victor Hanson article |publisher=Victor Hanson article |date=11 October 2006 |accessdate=27 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319045718/http://www.victorhanson.com/articles/hanson101106.html |archivedate=19 March 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref></blockquote> While this paradigm of \"free men\" outfighting \"slaves\" can be seen as a rather sweeping over-generalization (there are many counter-examples), it is nevertheless true that many commentators have used Thermopylae to illustrate this point.<ref name = L248>Lazenby, pp. 248\u2013253</ref>\n\nMilitarily, although the battle was actually not decisive in the context of the Persian invasion, Thermopylae is of some significance on the basis of the first two days of fighting.

Greek epitaphs often appealed to the passing reader (always called 'stranger') for sympathy, but the epitaph for the dead Spartans at Thermopylae took this convention much further than usual, asking the reader to make a personal journey to Sparta to break the news that the Spartan expeditionary force had been wiped out. The stranger is also asked to stress that the Spartans died 'fulfilling their orders'.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!'''Translation'''\n!'''Notes'''\n|+\n|-\n|Go tell the Spartans, thou who passest by,<br />That here, obedient to their laws, we lie.<ref>Strachey, p. 481</ref>\n|[[William Lisle Bowles]]\n|-\n|Stranger, tell the Spartans that we behaved <br />as they would wish us to, and are buried here.<ref>Golding, exceprt from The Hot Gates.</ref>\n|[[William Golding]]\n|-\n|Stranger!

The monument is made of marble and features a bronze statue depicting the god [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]], to whom the ancient Thespians accorded particular [[Religion in ancient Greece|religious veneration]]. Under the statue, a sign reads: \"In memory of the seven hundred Thespians.\"\n\nA plate below the statue explains its symbolism:\n* The headless male figure symbolizes the anonymous sacrifice of the 700 Thespians to their country.\n* The outstretched chest symbolizes the struggle, the gallantry, the strength, the bravery and the courage.\n* The open wing symbolizes the victory, the glory, the soul, the spirit and the freedom.\n* The broken wing symbolizes the voluntary sacrifice and death.\n* The naked body symbolizes Eros, the most important god of the ancient Thespians, a god of creation, beauty and life.\n\nThe monument to the Thespians is placed beside the one to the Spartans.\n\n===Associated legends===\n[[File:The Battle of Thermopylae engraving.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''The Battle of Thermopylae'', 19th century engraving]]\nHerodotus' colorful account of the battle has provided history with many apocryphal incidents and conversations away from the main historical events. These accounts are obviously not verifiable, but they form an integral part of the legend of the battle and often demonstrate the [[laconic]] speech (and wit) of the Spartans to good effect.\n\nFor instance, [[Plutarch]] recounts, in his ''Sayings of Spartan Women'', upon his departure, Leonidas' wife [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Gorgo]] asked what she should do if he did not return, to which Leonidas replied, \"Marry a good man and have good children.\"<ref>Plutarch, Apophthegmata Laconica [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0197%3Achapter%3D51%3Asection%3D2 Plut. Apoph. 51.2] and Moralia, 240 E (6)</ref>\n\nIt is reported that, upon arriving at Thermopylae, the Persians sent a mounted scout to reconnoitre. The Greeks allowed him to come up to the camp, observe them, and depart. Xerxes found the scout's reports of the size of the Greek force, and that the Spartans were indulging in [[calisthenics|callisthenics]] and combing their long hair, laughable. Seeking the counsel of [[Demaratus]], an exiled Spartan king in his retinue, Xerxes was told the Spartans were preparing for battle, and it was their custom to adorn their hair when they were about to risk their lives. Demaratus called them \"the bravest men in Greece\" and warned the Great King they intended to dispute the pass. He emphasized that he had tried to warn Xerxes earlier in the campaign, but the king had refused to believe him. He added that if Xerxes ever managed to subdue the Spartans, \"there is no other nation in all the world which will venture to lift a hand in their defence.\"<ref name=VII209>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.209.1 VII, 209]</ref>\n\nHerodotus also describes Leonidas' reception of a Persian embassy. The ambassador told Leonidas that Xerxes would offer him the kingship of all Greece if he joined with Xerxes. Leonidas answered: \"If you had any knowledge of the noble things of life, you would refrain from coveting others' possessions; but for me to die for Greece is better than to be the sole ruler over the people of my race.\"<ref>Plutarch, Moralia, 225, saying 10</ref> Then the ambassador asked him more forcefully to surrender their arms. To this Leonidas gave his famous answer: {{lang|grc|[[Molon labe|\u039c\u03bf\u03bb\u1f7c\u03bd \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03ad]]}} (pronounced {{IPA-el|mo\u02c8l\u0254\u02d0n la\u02c8be}}) \"Come and get them.\"<ref>Plutarch, Apophthegmata Laconica, Saying 11.</ref>\n\nSuch laconic bravery doubtlessly helped to maintain morale. Herodotus writes that when [[Dienekes]], a Spartan soldier, was informed that Persian arrows would be so numerous as \"to block out the sun\", he retorted, \"So much the better...then we shall fight our battle in the shade.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.226.1|title=Herodotus,  The Histories, Book 7, chapter 226, section 1|publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu|accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter the battle, Xerxes was curious as to what the Greeks had been trying to do (presumably because they had had so few men) and had some Arcadian deserters interrogated in his presence. The answer was: all the other men were participating in the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]. When Xerxes asked what the prize was for the winner, the answer was: \"an olive-wreath\". Upon hearing this, [[Tigranes]], a Persian general, said: \"Good heavens, [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]], what kind of men are these that you have pitted against us? It is not for riches that they contend but for honour!\" (Godley translation) or otherwise, \"Ye Gods, Mardonius, what men have you brought us to fight against?

The battle is revisited in countless [[adage]]s and works of popular culture, such as in films (e.g., ''[[The 300 Spartans]]'' (1962) and ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' (2007), based on the events during and close to the time of the battle), in literature, in song, in television programs, and in video games. The battle is also discussed in many [[Article (publishing)|articles]] and books on the theory and practice of warfare.\n\n{{main|Sparta in popular culture}}\nPrior to the battle, the [[Hellenes]] remembered the [[Dorians]], an ethnic distinction which applied to the [[Sparta]]ns, as the conquerors and displacers of the [[Ionians]] in the [[Peloponnesus]].
