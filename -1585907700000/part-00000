It is the main tourist attraction of Aiud. The [[citadel]] is fairly small, with a perimeter of 350&nbsp;metres, and it is in the form of an irregular [[pentagon]]. The earliest documented evidence of the citadel extant today dates from 7 November 1293, a privilege issued by King Ladislaus IV - King of Hungary (1272\u20131290), but local tradition holds that the first stone watch tower was finished during the Mongol invasion of Europe in 1241. Other important events for the citadel: the serfs uprisings from 1437; the conquest of [[Michael the Brave]]; the [[Habsburg]] attack in 1704 and 1717; the Christian uprising - Religious war in 1758 - 1761; the peasant movement from 1784 and the Revolutionary wave of 1848 - 1849.\n\n==== The Students' Monument ====\nDue to its strong educational culture, which dates back to the foundations of the city, the Students' Monument (''Monumentul studentesc'') is the oldest monument in Aiud. It is located in the beautiful City Park, and was erected in memory of the students who fought against the [[Habsburg]] invasion in 1704. The monument was erected in 1904, 200 years after the invasion.\n\n==== The \"Calvarul Aiudului\" Monument ====\nThe \"Calvarul Aiudului\" Monument is a modern monument in remembrance of the suffering and deaths during the [[Communist]] regime of Romania. The monument, started in 1992, is made up of many crosses (6&nbsp;metres tall), symbolising the traditions of Romania. In the Communist era, Aiud was an important centre where the elite of the Communist resistance were buried,{{cn|date=August 2016}} and the \"Calvarul Aiudului\" monument seeks to remember those.{{what?|date=August 2016}} The monument is located just outside the city centre, in the southwest.\n\n==== The City Hall ====\nThe City Hall of Aiud is located right in the centre of the city, at No. 1 Consiliul Europei street, close to the Aiud Citadel. The edifice, built in the 1890s, is built in the majestic style of those times, with balconies, statues, decorations and wonderful interiors.\n\n==== Museums ====\nAiud is home to two major public museums. They are the Museum of History (temporarily closed due to renovations starting in 2013) and the Museum of Natural Science. The history [[museum]] was built in 1796 and is housed in a historical building. There is a large collection of coins, as well as medieval and pre-medieval [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]]. The collection of the Museum of Natural Sciences dates back from 1720. It is based mainly on [[zoology]], as well as [[botany]], [[paleontology]] and [[geology]].\n\n==== Churches ====\nMost of Aiud's population are [[Christians|Christian]], but they also come from a variety of [[religious denomination|denominations]], including [[Catholicism]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and well as Reformed, Unitarian, [[Baptist]] and [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] faiths. Therefore, there are places of worship for all these religions.\n\nThe Orthodox Cathedral is located in the southeast of the city, and is an impressive building with high ceilings and wonderful domes. It was built after the unification of Transylvania with the rest of Romania ([[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]]) on 1 December 1918. The construction started in 1927 and went on for some decades. The architecture was inspired from the St. Sofia church in [[Istanbul]], and is built in [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] style.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church, albeit being smaller and less imposing that the Orthodox Cathedral, is still very beautiful, built in baroque style. Also, it is situated in Cuza Vod\u0103 Square, surrounding the medieval Aiud Citadel, making the Church very ideal in terms of surroundings. The church contains a large organ as well as stained glass windows which were painted by an artist from [[Budapest]].\n\nThe Reformed Church mainly serves the [[Magyars|Hungarian]] minority of Aiud, which played a big role in the identity of the city in terms of education, art, architecture and more. Their church is arguably the most memorable of the three main churches, because it is located right in the Aiud Citadel, and is medieval in architecture style, being the oldest church in Aiud.\n\n==== Monasteries ====\nThe most famous monastery in the Aiud area is the R\u00e2me\u021b monastery, which was built in the 15th century. Its architecture is classically Romanian, resembling the painted monasteries of Moldavia such as [[Voronet]]. In the monastery there is also a museum. In addition to R\u00e2me\u021b monastery, there are also monasteries at Magina and Cicau.\n\n==== Historical Colleges ====\nThe [[Bethlen Gabor College]], with 1011 students today and a rich history, is Aiud's most important educational institution. The college, named after [[Gabriel Bethlen]], [[Principality of Transylvania (1570\u20131711)|Prince of Transylvania]] (1613\u20131629), was founded in 1622 in [[Alba-Iulia]], the capital city of Alba County, and it was then moved to Aiud. Later on, it was also moved to [[Cluj-Napoca]] for a short time. Today, the institution is located in a 19th-century historical building, and it is also home to an important [[library]].\n\n==== Kem\u00e9ny - Zeyk mansion ====\n[[File:Kem\u00e9ny - Zeyk udvarh\u00e1z.tif|thumb|Kem\u00e9ny - Zeyk mansion]]\nCenter of political life in Aiud in the 19th century.\n\n=== Natural Attractions ===\nAs well as rich culture, Aiud is also littered with wonderful scenic tourist attractions in terms of the [[natural environment|environment]]. There are also many activities available throughout the year, especially in [[fishing]] and [[hunting]]. This provides a strong base for ecotourism in the area, as there are beautiful forests, hills and mountains and fresh air.\n\n== Accessibility and Transport ==\nAiud is easily accessible from all parts of Romania due to its position in the centre of the country and its road network. The city is located on the national road running from [[Bucharest]] to [[Oradea]] and then crossing the Hungarian border to Budapest. Therefore, most public coach services running between Budapest and Bucharest via Oradea stop at Aiud.\n\n=== Railways ===\nAiud is an important [[railway]] hub and is served frequently by [[Caile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne|CFR]] national trains. It is located on the main line from Oradea to Bucharest via Cluj-Napoca. Consequently, there are 46 trains passing daily through Aiud (with very frequent connections to main cities), to and from the following main cities:\n\n* Cluj-Napoca - 18 trains daily\n* Alba Iulia - 10 trains daily\n* [[Bra\u0219ov]], [[Sighi\u0219oara]] and [[Ploie\u0219ti]] - 5 trains daily\n* Bucharest, [[Deva, Romania|Deva]], [[T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]] and [[Timi\u0219oara]] - 4 trains daily\n* [[Sibiu]] - 3 trains daily\n* Oradea, [[Huedin]], [[Arad, Romania|Arad]], [[Satu Mare]], [[Constan\u021ba]], [[Mangalia]], [[Suceava]], [[Ia\u0219i]] - 2 trains daily\n* [[Craiova]] and [[Sighetu Marma\u021biei]] - 1 train daily\n\n(The number of trains daily indicates trains in both directions. For example, to Cluj-Napoca there are 18 trains daily, meaning there are 18 trains to Cluj-Napoca and 18 trains from Cluj-Napoca (a total of 36 services).)\n\n== Health ==\nIn Aiud municipality, there is a new hospital built in 1993. It has 318 beds and 15 sections. There are also [[radiology]] services, 24-hour [[emergency service]]s and a large [[ambulance]] station, making the [[hospital]] one of the better-equipped in the region. Nearby, there is also a medical centre with 14 specialised cabinets. There is also a [[tuberculosis]] sanatory in Aiud, and it is situated in the southeast of the city. This hospital was built in 1914 and currently has 220 beds.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage}}\n{{commons category|Aiud}}\n\n{{LocalitiesAlba}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Aiud| ]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Alba County]]\n[[Category:Cities in Romania]]\n[[Category:Market towns in Transylvania]]\n[[Category:Monotowns in Romania]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the city|the river|Aiud (river)|the prison|Aiud prison}}\n{{Infobox Romanian subdivision\n|type                   = municipality\n|county                 = Alba\n|population_total       = auto\n|official_name=Aiud\n|image_skyline = Aiud_view_Road_to_Turda.jpg\n|image_caption = \n|image_shield=ROU AB Aiud CoA1.jpg\n|image_map = Aiud jud Alba.png\n|map_caption = Location in Alba County\n|coordinates = {{coord|46|18|44|N|23|43|45|E|region:RO|display=inline,title}}\n|leader_party=PNL\n|leader_name=Oana Badea\n|area_total_km2=142.52\n|website= http://www.aiud.ro/; http://www.aiudonline.ro/\n}}\n\n'''Aiud''' ({{IPA-ro|a\u02c8jud|-|Ro-Aiud.ogg}}; {{lang-la|Brucla}}, {{lang-hu|Nagyenyed}}, <small>Hungarian pronunciation</small>: {{convertIPA-hu|\u2019|n|a|gy|e|ny|e|d}}; {{lang-de|Stra\u00dfburg am Mieresch}}) is a [[municipiu|city]] located in [[Alba County|Alba]] county, [[Transylvania]], [[Romania]].

It was built after the unification of Transylvania with the rest of Romania ([[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]]) on 1 December 1918. The construction started in 1927 and went on for some decades. The architecture was inspired from the St. Sofia church in [[Istanbul]], and is built in [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] style.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church, albeit being smaller and less imposing that the Orthodox Cathedral, is still very beautiful, built in baroque style. Also, it is situated in Cuza Vod\u0103 Square, surrounding the medieval Aiud Citadel, making the Church very ideal in terms of surroundings. The church contains a large organ as well as stained glass windows which were painted by an artist from [[Budapest]].\n\nThe Reformed Church mainly serves the [[Magyars|Hungarian]] minority of Aiud, which played a big role in the identity of the city in terms of education, art, architecture and more. Their church is arguably the most memorable of the three main churches, because it is located right in the Aiud Citadel, and is medieval in architecture style, being the oldest church in Aiud.\n\n==== Monasteries ====\nThe most famous monastery in the Aiud area is the R\u00e2me\u021b monastery, which was built in the 15th century. Its architecture is classically Romanian, resembling the painted monasteries of Moldavia such as [[Voronet]]. In the monastery there is also a museum. In addition to R\u00e2me\u021b monastery, there are also monasteries at Magina and Cicau.\n\n==== Historical Colleges ====\nThe [[Bethlen Gabor College]], with 1011 students today and a rich history, is Aiud's most important educational institution. The college, named after [[Gabriel Bethlen]], [[Principality of Transylvania (1570\u20131711)|Prince of Transylvania]] (1613\u20131629), was founded in 1622 in [[Alba-Iulia]], the capital city of Alba County, and it was then moved to Aiud. Later on, it was also moved to [[Cluj-Napoca]] for a short time. Today, the institution is located in a 19th-century historical building, and it is also home to an important [[library]].\n\n==== Kem\u00e9ny - Zeyk mansion ====\n[[File:Kem\u00e9ny - Zeyk udvarh\u00e1z.tif|thumb|Kem\u00e9ny - Zeyk mansion]]\nCenter of political life in Aiud in the 19th century.\n\n=== Natural Attractions ===\nAs well as rich culture, Aiud is also littered with wonderful scenic tourist attractions in terms of the [[natural environment|environment]]. There are also many activities available throughout the year, especially in [[fishing]] and [[hunting]]. This provides a strong base for ecotourism in the area, as there are beautiful forests, hills and mountains and fresh air.\n\n== Accessibility and Transport ==\nAiud is easily accessible from all parts of Romania due to its position in the centre of the country and its road network. The city is located on the national road running from [[Bucharest]] to [[Oradea]] and then crossing the Hungarian border to Budapest. Therefore, most public coach services running between Budapest and Bucharest via Oradea stop at Aiud.\n\n=== Railways ===\nAiud is an important [[railway]] hub and is served frequently by [[Caile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne|CFR]] national trains. It is located on the main line from Oradea to Bucharest via Cluj-Napoca. Consequently, there are 46 trains passing daily through Aiud (with very frequent connections to main cities), to and from the following main cities:\n\n* Cluj-Napoca - 18 trains daily\n* Alba Iulia - 10 trains daily\n* [[Bra\u0219ov]], [[Sighi\u0219oara]] and [[Ploie\u0219ti]] - 5 trains daily\n* Bucharest, [[Deva, Romania|Deva]], [[T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]] and [[Timi\u0219oara]] - 4 trains daily\n* [[Sibiu]] - 3 trains daily\n* Oradea, [[Huedin]], [[Arad, Romania|Arad]], [[Satu Mare]], [[Constan\u021ba]], [[Mangalia]], [[Suceava]], [[Ia\u0219i]] - 2 trains daily\n* [[Craiova]] and [[Sighetu Marma\u021biei]] - 1 train daily\n\n(The number of trains daily indicates trains in both directions. For example, to Cluj-Napoca there are 18 trains daily, meaning there are 18 trains to Cluj-Napoca and 18 trains from Cluj-Napoca (a total of 36 services).)\n\n== Health ==\nIn Aiud municipality, there is a new hospital built in 1993. It has 318 beds and 15 sections. There are also [[radiology]] services, 24-hour [[emergency service]]s and a large [[ambulance]] station, making the [[hospital]] one of the better-equipped in the region. Nearby, there is also a medical centre with 14 specialised cabinets. There is also a [[tuberculosis]] sanatory in Aiud, and it is situated in the southeast of the city. This hospital was built in 1914 and currently has 220 beds.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage}}\n{{commons category|Aiud}}\n\n{{LocalitiesAlba}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Aiud| ]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Alba County]]\n[[Category:Cities in Romania]]\n[[Category:Market towns in Transylvania]]\n[[Category:Monotowns in Romania]]\n", "name_user": "Markussep", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiud"}
