Thus [[flag semaphore]] is a method of telegraphy, whereas [[pigeon post]] is not. Ancient [[signal]]ling systems, although sometimes quite extensive and sophisticated as in China, were generally not capable of transmitting arbitrary text messages. Possible messages were fixed and predetermined and such systems are thus not true telegraphs.\n\nThe earliest true telegraph put into widespread use was the [[optical telegraph]] of [[Claude Chappe]], invented in the late 18th century. The system was extensively used in France, and European countries controlled by France, during the [[Napoleonic era]]. The [[electric telegraph]] started to replace the optical telegraph in the mid-19th century. It was first taken up in Britain in the form of the [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph]], initially used mostly as an aid to [[railway signalling]]. This was quickly followed by a different system developed in the United States by [[Samuel Morse]]. The electric telegraph was slower to develop in France due to the established optical telegraph system, but an electrical telegraph was put into use with a code compatible with the Chappe optical telegraph. The Morse system was adopted as the international standard in 1865, using a modified [[Morse code]] developed in Germany.\n\nThe [[heliograph]] is a telegraph system using reflected sunlight for signalling. It was mainly used in areas where the electrical telegraph had not been established and generally uses the same code. The most extensive heliograph network established was in Arizona and New Mexico during the [[Apache Wars]]. The heliograph was standard military equipment as late as [[World War II]]. [[Wireless telegraphy]] developed in the early 20th century. Wireless telegraphy became important for maritime use, and was a competitor to electrical telegraphy using [[submarine telegraph cable]]s in international communications.\n\nTelegrams became a popular means of sending messages once telegraph prices had fallen sufficiently. Traffic became high enough to spur the development of automated systems\u2014[[teleprinter]]s and [[punched tape]] transmission. These systems led to new [[telegraph code]]s, starting with the [[Baudot code]]. However, telegrams were never able to compete with the letter post on price, and competition from the [[telephone]], which removed their speed advantage, drove the telegraph into decline from 1920 onwards. The few remaining telegraph applications were largely taken over by alternatives on the [[internet]] towards the end of the 20th century.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe word \"telegraph\" (from [[Ancient Greek]]: \u03c4\u1fc6\u03bb\u03b5, ''[[wikt:tele-|t\u00eale]]'', \"at a distance\" and \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, ''[[wikt:-graphy|gr\u00e1phein]]'', \"to write\") was first coined by the French inventor of the [[Semaphore telegraph]], [[Claude Chappe]], who also coined the word \"semaphore\".<ref>Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions & Discoveries of the 18th Century, Jonathan Shectman, p172</ref>\n\nA \"telegraph\" is a device for transmitting and receiving messages over long distances, i.e., for telegraphy. The word \"telegraph\" alone now generally refers to an [[electrical telegraph]]. Wireless telegraphy is transmission of messages over radio with telegraphic codes.\n\nContrary to the extensive definition used by Chappe, [[Samuel Morse|Morse]] argued that the term ''telegraph'' can strictly be applied only to systems that transmit ''and'' record messages at a distance. This is to be distinguished from ''semaphore'', which merely transmits messages. Smoke signals, for instance, are to be considered semaphore, not telegraph. According to Morse, telegraph dates only from 1832 when [[Pavel Schilling]] invented one of the earliest electrical telegraphs.<ref>Samuel F. B. Morse, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rGgPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA7 ''Examination of the Telegraphic Apparatus and the Processes in Telegraphy''], pages 7\u20138, Philp & Solomons 1869 {{OCLC|769828711}}.</ref>\n\nA telegraph message sent by an [[electrical telegraph]] operator or telegrapher using [[Morse code]] (or a [[printing telegraph]] operator using plain text) was known as a ''telegram''. A ''cablegram'' was a message sent by a submarine telegraph cable,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cablegram|title=Cablegram - Definition of cablegram by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}</ref> often shortened to a ''cable'' or a ''wire''. Later, a ''Telex'' was a message sent by a [[Teleprinter#Telex|Telex]] network, a switched network of [[teleprinter]]s similar to a telephone network.\n\nA ''[[wirephoto]]'' or ''wire picture'' was a newspaper picture that was sent from a remote location by a [[Fax|facsimile telegraph]]. A ''diplomatic telegram'', also known as a [[diplomatic cable]], is the term given to a confidential communication between a [[diplomatic mission]] and the [[Foreign minister|foreign ministry]] of its parent country.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/11/29/10/1796-memos-us-embassy-manila-wikileaks-cablegate |title=1,796 memos from US embassy in Manila in WikiLeaks 'Cablegate' |date=29 November 2010 |accessdate=29 November 2010 |publisher=[[ABS\u2013CBN Corporation]]}}</ref><ref>Definition of \"cable\", {{cite book |title=The Macquarie Dictionary |edition=3rd |year=1997 |publisher=Macquarie Library |location=Australia |isbn=978-0-949757-89-0 |quote=(n.) 4. a telegram sent abroad, especially by submarine cable.

One of the oldest examples is the signal towers of the [[Great Wall of China]]. In {{nowrap|400 BC}}, signals could be sent by [[beacon|beacon fires]] or [[military drum|drum beats]]. By {{nowrap|200 BC}} complex flag signalling had developed, and by the [[Han dynasty]] (200 BC\u2013220 AD) signallers had a choice of lights, flags, or gunshots to send signals. By the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907) a message could be sent 700 miles in 24 hours. The [[Ming dynasty]] (1368\u20131644) added [[artillery]] to the possible signals. While the signalling was complex (for instance, different-coloured flags could be used to indicate enemy strength), only predetermined messages could be sent.<ref>Christopher H. Sterling, \"Great Wall of China\", pp. 197-198 in, Christopher H. Sterling (ed), ''Military Communications: From Ancient Times to the 21st Century'', ABC-CLIO, 2008 {{ISBN|1851097325}}.</ref> The Chinese signalling system extended well beyond the Great Wall. Signal towers away from the wall were used to give early warning of an attack. Others were built even further out as part of the protection of trade routes, especially the [[Silk Road]].<ref>Morris Rossabi, ''From Yuan to Modern China and Mongolia'', p. 203, Brill, 2014 {{ISBN|9004285296}}.</ref>\n\nSignal fires were widely used in Europe and elsewhere for military purposes. The Roman army made frequent use of them, as did their enemies, and the remains of some of the stations still exist. Few details have been recorded of European/Mediterranean signalling systems and the possible messages. One of the few for which details are known is a system invented by [[Aeneas Tacticus]] (4th century BC). Tacticus's system had water filled pots at the two signal stations which were drained in synchronisation. Annotation on a floating scale indicated which message was being sent or received. Signals sent by means of [[torch]]es indicated when to start and stop draining to keep the synchronisation.<ref name=Woods>David L. Woods, \"Ancient signals\", pp. 24-25 in, Christopher H. Sterling (ed), ''Military Communications: From Ancient Times to the 21st Century'', ABC-CLIO, 2008 {{ISBN|1851097325}}.</ref>\n\nNone of the signalling systems discussed above are true telegraphs in the sense of a system that can transmit arbitrary messages over arbitrary distances. Lines of signalling relay stations can send messages to any required distance, but all these systems are limited to one extent or another in the range of messages that they can send. A system like [[flag semaphore]], with an alphabetic code, can certainly send any given message, but the system is designed for short-range communication between two persons. An [[engine order telegraph]], used to send instructions from the bridge of a ship to the engine room, fails to meet both criteria; it has a limited distance and very simple message set. There was only one ancient signalling system described that ''does'' meet these criteria. That was a system using the [[Polybius square]] to encode an alphabet. [[Polybius]] (2nd century BC) suggested using two successive groups of torches to identify the coordinates of the letter of the alphabet being transmitted. The number of said torches held up signalled the grid square that contained the letter. There is no definite record of the system ever being used, but there are several passages in ancient texts that some think are suggestive.  Holzmann and Pehrson, for instance, suggest that [[Livy]] is describing its use by [[Philip V of Macedon]] in 207 BC during the [[First Macedonian War]].  Nothing else that could be described as a true telegraph existed until the 17th century.<ref name=Woods/><ref name=Holzmann/>{{rp|26\u201329}}  Possibly the first alphabetic [[telegraph code]] in the modern era is due to [[Franz Kessler]] who published his work in 1616.  Kessler used a lamp placed inside a barrel with a moveable shutter operated by the signaller.  The signals were observed at a distance with the newly-invented telescope.<ref name=Holzmann/>{{rp|32\u201334}}\n\n==Drum telegraph==\n{{main|Drums in communication}}\nIn several places around the world, a system of passing messages from village to village using drum beats was developed.  This was particularly highly developed in Africa.  At the time of its discovery in Africa, the speed of message transmission was faster than any existing European system using [[optical telegraph]]s.  The African drum system was not alphabetical.  Rather, the drum beats followed the [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]] of the language.  This made messages highly ambiguous and context was important for their correct interpretation.<ref>James Gleick, \"Drums that talk\", ch. 1 in, ''The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood'', Fourth Estate, 2011 {{isbn|9780007225736}}</ref>\n\n==Optical telegraph==\n[[File:Construction-pruss-opt-tele.png|thumb|upright=0.7|right|Schematic of a Prussian optical telegraph (or [[Semaphore line|semaphore]]) tower, c. 1835]]\n[[File:Chappe semaphore.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Demonstration of the semaphore]]\n{{main|Optical telegraph}}\nAn [[optical telegraph]] is a telegraph consisting of a line of stations in towers or natural high points which signal to each other by means of shutters or paddles.

In 1790, the Chappe brothers set about devising a system of communication that would allow the central government to receive intelligence and to transmit orders in the shortest possible time. On 2 March 1791, at 11 am, they sent the message \"si vous r\u00e9ussissez, vous serez bient\u00f4t couverts de gloire\" (If you succeed, you will soon bask in glory) between Brulon and Parce, a distance of {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1}}. The first means used a combination of black and white panels, clocks, telescopes, and codebooks to send their message.\n\nIn 1792, Claude was appointed ''Ing\u00e9nieur-T\u00e9l\u00e9graphiste'' and charged with establishing a line of stations between Paris and [[Lille]], a distance of {{Convert|230|km}}. It was used to carry dispatches for the war between France and Austria. In 1794, it brought news of a French capture of [[Cond\u00e9-sur-l'Escaut]] from the Austrians less than an hour after it occurred.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22909590 How Napoleon's semaphore telegraph changed the world], BBC News, Hugh Schofield, 16 June 2013</ref><!-- Note: this BBC source tell this story well, and supports the Lille and Conde statements, but was not used for the whole section, which remains 'unreferenced' -->\n\nThe [[Prussian semaphore system|Prussian system]] was put into effect in the 1830s. However, they were highly dependent on good weather and daylight to work and even then could accommodate only about two words per minute.

It was used to manage railway traffic and to prevent accidents as part of the railway signalling system.

The messages were for the operation of the rope-haulage system for pulling trains up the 1 in 77 bank. The world's first permanent railway telegraph was completed in July 1839 between London Paddington and West Drayton on the [[Great Western Railway]] with an electric telegraph using a four-needle system.\n\nThe concept of a [[Signalling block system|signalling \"block\" system]] was proposed by Cooke in 1842. Railway signal telegraphy did not change in essence from Cooke's initial concept for more than a century. In this system each line of railway was divided into sections or blocks of several miles length. Entry to and exit from the block was to be authorised by electric telegraph and signalled by the line-side semaphore signals, so that only a single train could occupy the rails. In Cooke's original system, a single-needle telegraph was adapted to indicate just two messages: \"Line Clear\" and \"Line Blocked\". The signaller would adjust his line-side signals accordingly. As first implemented in 1844 each station had as many needles as there were stations on the line, giving a complete picture of the traffic. As lines expanded, a sequence of pairs of single-needle instruments were adopted, one pair for each block in each direction.<ref>{{Citation |last= Roberts |first= Steven |author-link= Stephen Roberts (historian) |title= Distant Writing: 15.

Unlike most forms of flag signalling, which are used over relatively short distances, wigwag is designed to maximise the distance covered\u2014up to 20 miles in some cases.  Wigwag achieved this by using a large flag\u2014a single flag can be held with both hands unlike flag semaphore which has a flag in each hand\u2014and using motions rather than positions as its symbols since motions are more easily seen.  It was invented by US Army surgeon [[Albert J. Myer]] in the 1850s who later became the first head of the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]].  Wigwag was used extensively during the [[American Civil War]] where it filled a gap left by the electrical telegraph.  Although the electrical telegraph had been in use for more than a decade, the network did not yet reach everywhere and portable, ruggedized equipment suitable for military use was not immediately available.  Permanent or semi-permanent stations were established during the war, some of them towers of enormous height and the system for a while could be described as a communications network.<ref>Rebecca Raines, [https://history.army.mil/html/books/030/30-17-1/CMH_Pub_30-17-1.pdf ''Getting the Message Through''], US Government Printing Office, 1996 {{isbn|0160872812}}.</ref><ref>Albert J.

The idea for a telegraph of this type was first proposed as a modification of surveying equipment ([[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], 1821). Various uses of mirrors were made for communication in the following years, mostly for military purposes, but the first device to become widely used was a heliograph with a moveable mirror ([[Henry Christopher Mance|Mance]], 1869). The system was used by the French during the [[Siege of Paris (1870\u201371)|1870\u201371 siege of Paris]], with night-time signalling using [[kerosene lamp]]s as the source of light. An improved version (Begbie, 1870) was used by British military in many colonial wars, including the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] (1879). At some point, a morse key was added to the apparatus to give the operator the same degree of control as in the electric telegraph.<ref name=Woods2>David L. Woods, \"Heliograph and mirrors\", pp. 208-211 in, Christopher H. Sterling (ed), ''Military Communications: From Ancient Times to the 21st Century'', ABC-CLIO, 2008 {{ISBN|1851097325}}.</ref>\n\nAnother type of heliograph was the [[heliostat]] fitted with a Colomb shutter. The heliostat was essentially a surveying instrument with a fixed mirror and so could not transmit a code by itself. The term ''heliostat'' is sometimes used as a synonym for ''heliograph'' because of this origin. The Colomb shutter ([[Francis Bolton|Bolton]] and [[Philip Howard Colomb|Colomb]], 1862) was originally invented to enable the transmission of morse code by [[signal lamp]] between [[Royal Navy]] ships at sea.<ref name=Woods2/>\n\nThe heliograph was heavily used by [[Nelson A. Miles]] in [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]] after he took over command (1886) of the fight against [[Geronimo]] and other [[Apache]] bands in the [[Apache Wars]]. Miles had previously set up the first heliograph line in the US between [[Fort Keogh]] and [[Fort Custer (Montana)|Fort Custer]] in [[Montana]]. He used the heliograph to fill in vast, thinly populated areas that were not covered by the electric telegraph. Twenty-six stations covered an area 200 by 300 miles. In a test of the system, a message was relayed 400 miles in four hours. Miles' enemies used [[smoke signal]]s and flashes of sunlight from metal, but lacked a sophisticated telegraph code.<ref>Nelson A. Miles, ''Personal Recollections and Observations of General Nelson A. Miles'', vol. 2, pp. 481-484, University of Nebraska Press, 1992 {{ISBN|0803281811}}.</ref> The heliograph was ideal for use in the American Southwest due to its clear air and mountainous terrain on which stations could be located. It was found necessary to lengthen the morse dash (which is much shorter in American Morse code than in the modern International Morse code) to aid differentiating from the morse dot.<ref name=Woods2/>\n\nUse of the heliograph declined from 1915 onwards, but remained in service in Britain and [[British Commonwealth]] countries for some time. Australian forces used the heliograph as late as 1942 in the [[Western Desert Campaign]] of [[World War II]]. Some form of heliograph was used by the [[mujahideen]] in the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]] (1979-1989).<ref name=Woods2/>\n{{clear|left}}\n\n==Teleprinter==\n{{main article|Teleprinter}}\n[[File:Clavier Baudot.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|A Baudot keyboard, 1884]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2008-0516-500, Fernschreibmaschine mit Telefonanschluss.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|A Creed Model 7 teleprinter, 1931]] \nA teleprinter is a telegraph machine that can send messages from a typewriter-like keyboard and print incoming messages in readable text with no need for the operators to be trained in the telegraph code used on the line.

It is then, either immediately or at some later time, run through a transmission machine which sends the message to the telegraph network. Multiple messages can be sequentially recorded on the same run of tape. The advantage of doing this is that messages can be sent at a steady, fast rate making maximum use of the available telegraph lines. The economic advantage of doing this is greatest on long, busy routes where the cost of the extra step of preparing the tape is outweighed by the cost of providing more telegraph lines. The first machine to use punched tape was Bain's teleprinter (Bain, 1843), but the system saw only limited use. Later versions of Bain's system achieved speeds up to 1000 words per minute, far faster than a human operator could achieve.<ref>Anton A.

After many breakthroughs, including applying the wired telegraphy concept of grounding the transmitter and receiver, Marconi was able, by early 1896, to transmit radio far beyond the short ranges that had been predicted.<ref>Sungook Hong, Wireless: From Marconi's Black-box to the Audion, MIT Press - 2001, page 21</ref> Having failed to interest the [[Italy|Italian]] government, the 22-year-old inventor brought his telegraphy system to Britain in 1896 and met [[William Preece]], a Welshman, who was a major figure in the field and Chief Engineer of the [[General Post Office]]. A series of demonstrations for the British government followed\u2014by March 1897, Marconi had transmitted Morse code signals over a distance of about {{convert|6|km}} across [[Salisbury Plain]].\n\nOn 13 May 1897, Marconi, assisted by George Kemp, a [[Cardiff]] Post Office engineer, transmitted the first [[wireless]] signals over water to [[Lavernock]] (near [[Penarth]] in [[Wales]]) from [[Flat Holm]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/flatholm/pages/marconi.shtml |title=Marconi: Radio Pioneer |accessdate=2008-04-12 |work=BBC South East Wales}}</ref> The message sent was \"ARE YOU READY\".

In 1904, Marconi began the first commercial service to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships, which could incorporate them into their on-board newspapers.

Telex development began in Germany in 1926, becoming an operational service in 1933 run by the Reichspost (Reich postal service). It had a speed of 50 baud\u2014approximately 66 words per minute. Up to 25 telex channels could share a single long-distance telephone channel by using [[voice frequency telegraphy]] [[frequency-division multiplexing|multiplexing]], making telex the least expensive method of reliable long-distance communication.{{cn|date=December 2018}} Telex was introduced into Canada in July 1957, and the United States in 1958.<ref>Phillip R.

Western Union gave up their patent battle with [[Alexander Graham Bell]] because they believed the telephone was not a threat to their telegraph business. The [[Bell Telephone Company]] was formed in 1877 and had 230 subscribers which grew to 30,000 by 1880. By 1886 there were a quarter of a million phones worldwide,<ref name=Phillips/>{{rp|276-277}} and nearly 2 million by 1900.<ref name=\"Standage\"/>{{rp|204}} The decline was briefly postponed by the rise of special occasion congratulatory telegrams.

The telegraph isolated the message (information) from the physical movement of objects or the process.<ref name=\"Carey, James 1989 p. 210\">Carey, James (1989). ''Communication as Culture'', Routledge, New York and London, p. 210</ref>\n\nThere was some fear of the new technology. According to author Allan J. Kimmel, some people \"feared that the telegraph would erode the quality of public discourse through the transmission of irrelevant, context-free information.\" [[Henry David Thoreau]] thought of the Transatlantic cable \"...perchance the first news that will leak through into the broad flapping American ear will be that Princess Adelaide has the whooping cough.\" Kimmel says these fears anticipate many of the characteristics of the modern internet age.<ref>Allan J. Kimmel, ''People and Products: Consumer Behavior and Product Design'', pp. 53-54, Routledge, 2015 {{ISBN|1317607503}}.</ref>\n\nInitially, the telegraph was expensive to use, so was mostly limited to businesses that could use it to improve profits. The telegraph had an enormous effect on three industries; finance, newspapers, and railways. Telegraphy facilitated the growth of organizations \"in the railroads, consolidated financial and commodity markets, and reduced information costs within and between firms\".<ref name=\"eh.net\"/> In the US, there were 200 to 300 stock exchanges before the telegraph, but most of these were unnecessary and unprofitable once the telegraph made financial transactions at a distance easy and drove down transaction costs.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/>{{rp|274-275}} This immense growth in the business sectors influenced society to embrace the use of telegrams once the cost had fallen.\n\nWorldwide telegraphy changed the gathering of information for news reporting. Journalists were using the telegraph for war reporting as early as 1846 when the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] broke out. News agencies were formed, such as the [[Associated Press]], for the purpose of reporting news by telegraph.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/>{{rp|274-275}} Messages and information would now travel far and wide, and the telegraph demanded a language \"stripped of the local, the regional; and colloquial\", to better facilitate a worldwide media language.<ref name=\"Carey, James 1989 p. 210\"/> Media language had to be standardized, which led to the gradual disappearance of different forms of speech and styles of [[journalism]] and storytelling.\n\nThe spread of the railways created a need for an accurate [[standard time]] to replace local arbitrary standards based on local [[noon]]. The means of achieving this synchronisation was the telegraph. This emphasis on precise time has led to major societal changes such as the concept of the [[time value of money]].<ref name=\"Phillips\"/>{{rp|273-274}}\n\nThe shortage of men to work as telegraph operators in the [[American Civil War]] opened up the opportunity for women of a well-paid skilled job.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/>{{rp|274}}\n\nThe economic impact of the telegraph was not much studied by economic historians until parallels started to be drawn with the rise of the internet. In fact, the electric telegraph was as important as the invention of printing in this respect. According to economist Ronnie J. Phillips, the reason for this may be that [[Institutional economics|institutional economists]] paid more attention to advances that required greater capital investment. The investment required to build railways, for instance, is orders of magnitude greater than that for the telegraph.<ref name=\"Phillips\">Ronnie J.

Thus [[flag semaphore]] is a method of telegraphy, whereas [[pigeon post]] is not. Ancient [[signal]]ling systems, although sometimes quite extensive and sophisticated as in China, were generally not capable of transmitting arbitrary text messages. Possible messages were fixed and predetermined and such systems are thus not true telegraphs.\n\nThe earliest true telegraph put into widespread use was the [[optical telegraph]] of [[Claude Chappe]], invented in the late 18th century. The system was extensively used in France, and European countries controlled by France, during the [[Napoleonic era]]. The [[electric telegraph]] started to replace the optical telegraph in the mid-19th century. It was first taken up in Britain in the form of the [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph]], initially used mostly as an aid to [[railway signalling]]. This was quickly followed by a different system developed in the United States by [[Samuel Morse]]. The electric telegraph was slower to develop in France due to the established optical telegraph system, but an electrical telegraph was put into use with a code compatible with the Chappe optical telegraph. The Morse system was adopted as the international standard in 1865, using a modified [[Morse code]] developed in Germany.\n\nThe [[heliograph]] is a telegraph system using reflected sunlight for signalling. It was mainly used in areas where the electrical telegraph had not been established and generally uses the same code. The most extensive heliograph network established was in Arizona and New Mexico during the [[Apache Wars]]. The heliograph was standard military equipment as late as [[World War II]]. [[Wireless telegraphy]] developed in the early 20th century. Wireless telegraphy became important for maritime use, and was a competitor to electrical telegraphy using [[submarine telegraph cable]]s in international communications.\n\nTelegrams became a popular means of sending messages once telegraph prices had fallen sufficiently. Traffic became high enough to spur the development of automated systems\u2014[[teleprinter]]s and [[punched tape]] transmission. These systems led to new [[telegraph code]]s, starting with the [[Baudot code]]. However, telegrams were never able to compete with the letter post on price, and competition from the [[telephone]], which removed their speed advantage, drove the telegraph into decline from 1920 onwards. The few remaining telegraph applications were largely taken over by alternatives on the [[internet]] towards the end of the 20th century.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe word \"telegraph\" (from [[Ancient Greek]]: \u03c4\u1fc6\u03bb\u03b5, ''[[wikt:tele-|t\u00eale]]'', \"at a distance\" and \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, ''[[wikt:-graphy|gr\u00e1phein]]'', \"to write\") was first coined by the French inventor of the [[Semaphore telegraph]], [[Claude Chappe]], who also coined the word \"semaphore\".<ref>Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions & Discoveries of the 18th Century, Jonathan Shectman, p172</ref>\n\nA \"telegraph\" is a device for transmitting and receiving messages over long distances, i.e., for telegraphy. The word \"telegraph\" alone now generally refers to an [[electrical telegraph]]. Wireless telegraphy is transmission of messages over radio with telegraphic codes.\n\nContrary to the extensive definition used by Chappe, [[Samuel Morse|Morse]] argued that the term ''telegraph'' can strictly be applied only to systems that transmit ''and'' record messages at a distance. This is to be distinguished from ''semaphore'', which merely transmits messages. Smoke signals, for instance, are to be considered semaphore, not telegraph. According to Morse, telegraph dates only from 1832 when [[Pavel Schilling]] invented one of the earliest electrical telegraphs.<ref>Samuel F. B.

One of the oldest examples is the signal towers of the [[Great Wall of China]]. In {{nowrap|400 BC}}, signals could be sent by [[beacon|beacon fires]] or [[military drum|drum beats]]. By {{nowrap|200 BC}} complex flag signalling had developed, and by the [[Han dynasty]] (200 BC\u2013220 AD) signallers had a choice of lights, flags, or gunshots to send signals. By the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907) a message could be sent 700 miles in 24 hours. The [[Ming dynasty]] (1368\u20131644) added [[artillery]] to the possible signals. While the signalling was complex (for instance, different-coloured flags could be used to indicate enemy strength), only predetermined messages could be sent.<ref>Christopher H. Sterling, \"Great Wall of China\", pp. 197-198 in, Christopher H. Sterling (ed), ''Military Communications: From Ancient Times to the 21st Century'', ABC-CLIO, 2008 {{ISBN|1851097325}}.</ref> The Chinese signalling system extended well beyond the Great Wall. Signal towers away from the wall were used to give early warning of an attack. Others were built even further out as part of the protection of trade routes, especially the [[Silk Road]].<ref>Morris Rossabi, ''From Yuan to Modern China and Mongolia'', p. 203, Brill, 2014 {{ISBN|9004285296}}.</ref>\n\nSignal fires were widely used in Europe and elsewhere for military purposes. The Roman army made frequent use of them, as did their enemies, and the remains of some of the stations still exist. Few details have been recorded of European/Mediterranean signalling systems and the possible messages. One of the few for which details are known is a system invented by [[Aeneas Tacticus]] (4th century BC). Tacticus's system had water filled pots at the two signal stations which were drained in synchronisation. Annotation on a floating scale indicated which message was being sent or received. Signals sent by means of [[torch]]es indicated when to start and stop draining to keep the synchronisation.<ref name=Woods>David L. Woods, \"Ancient signals\", pp. 24-25 in, Christopher H. Sterling (ed), ''Military Communications: From Ancient Times to the 21st Century'', ABC-CLIO, 2008 {{ISBN|1851097325}}.</ref>\n\nNone of the signalling systems discussed above are true telegraphs in the sense of a system that can transmit arbitrary messages over arbitrary distances. Lines of signalling relay stations can send messages to any required distance, but all these systems are limited to one extent or another in the range of messages that they can send. A system like [[flag semaphore]], with an alphabetic code, can certainly send any given message, but the system is designed for short-range communication between two persons. An [[engine order telegraph]], used to send instructions from the bridge of a ship to the engine room, fails to meet both criteria; it has a limited distance and very simple message set. There was only one ancient signalling system described that ''does'' meet these criteria. That was a system using the [[Polybius square]] to encode an alphabet. [[Polybius]] (2nd century BC) suggested using two successive groups of torches to identify the coordinates of the letter of the alphabet being transmitted. The number of said torches held up signalled the grid square that contained the letter. There is no definite record of the system ever being used, but there are several passages in ancient texts that some think are suggestive.  Holzmann and Pehrson, for instance, suggest that [[Livy]] is describing its use by [[Philip V of Macedon]] in 207 BC during the [[First Macedonian War]].  Nothing else that could be described as a true telegraph existed until the 17th century.<ref name=Woods/><ref name=Holzmann/>{{rp|26\u201329}}  Possibly the first alphabetic [[telegraph code]] in the modern era is due to [[Franz Kessler]] who published his work in 1616.  Kessler used a lamp placed inside a barrel with a moveable shutter operated by the signaller.  The signals were observed at a distance with the newly-invented telescope.<ref name=Holzmann/>{{rp|32\u201334}}\n\n==Drum telegraph==\n{{main|Drums in communication}}\nIn several places around the world, a system of passing messages from village to village using drum beats was developed.  This was particularly highly developed in Africa.  At the time of its discovery in Africa, the speed of message transmission was faster than any existing European system using [[optical telegraph]]s.  The African drum system was not alphabetical.  Rather, the drum beats followed the [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]] of the language.  This made messages highly ambiguous and context was important for their correct interpretation.<ref>James Gleick, \"Drums that talk\", ch. 1 in, ''The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood'', Fourth Estate, 2011 {{isbn|9780007225736}}</ref>\n\n==Optical telegraph==\n[[File:Construction-pruss-opt-tele.png|thumb|upright=0.7|right|Schematic of a Prussian optical telegraph (or [[Semaphore line|semaphore]]) tower, c. 1835]]\n[[File:Chappe semaphore.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Demonstration of the semaphore]]\n{{main|Optical telegraph}}\nAn [[optical telegraph]] is a telegraph consisting of a line of stations in towers or natural high points which signal to each other by means of shutters or paddles.

In 1790, the Chappe brothers set about devising a system of communication that would allow the central government to receive intelligence and to transmit orders in the shortest possible time. On 2 March 1791, at 11 am, they sent the message \"si vous r\u00e9ussissez, vous serez bient\u00f4t couverts de gloire\" (If you succeed, you will soon bask in glory) between Brulon and Parce, a distance of {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1}}. The first means used a combination of black and white panels, clocks, telescopes, and codebooks to send their message.\n\nIn 1792, Claude was appointed ''Ing\u00e9nieur-T\u00e9l\u00e9graphiste'' and charged with establishing a line of stations between Paris and [[Lille]], a distance of {{Convert|230|km}}. It was used to carry dispatches for the war between France and Austria. In 1794, it brought news of a French capture of [[Cond\u00e9-sur-l'Escaut]] from the Austrians less than an hour after it occurred.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22909590 How Napoleon's semaphore telegraph changed the world], BBC News, Hugh Schofield, 16 June 2013</ref><!-- Note: this BBC source tell this story well, and supports the Lille and Conde statements, but was not used for the whole section, which remains 'unreferenced' -->\n\nThe [[Prussian semaphore system|Prussian system]] was put into effect in the 1830s.

However, this led to a breakthrough for the electric telegraph, as up to this point the Great Western had insisted on exclusive use and refused Cooke permission to open public telegraph offices.

The messages were for the operation of the rope-haulage system for pulling trains up the 1 in 77 bank. The world's first permanent railway telegraph was completed in July 1839 between London Paddington and West Drayton on the [[Great Western Railway]] with an electric telegraph using a four-needle system.\n\nThe concept of a [[Signalling block system|signalling \"block\" system]] was proposed by Cooke in 1842. Railway signal telegraphy did not change in essence from Cooke's initial concept for more than a century. In this system each line of railway was divided into sections or blocks of several miles length. Entry to and exit from the block was to be authorised by electric telegraph and signalled by the line-side semaphore signals, so that only a single train could occupy the rails. In Cooke's original system, a single-needle telegraph was adapted to indicate just two messages: \"Line Clear\" and \"Line Blocked\". The signaller would adjust his line-side signals accordingly. As first implemented in 1844 each station had as many needles as there were stations on the line, giving a complete picture of the traffic. As lines expanded, a sequence of pairs of single-needle instruments were adopted, one pair for each block in each direction.<ref>{{Citation |last= Roberts |first= Steven |author-link= Stephen Roberts (historian) |title= Distant Writing: 15.

Unlike most forms of flag signalling, which are used over relatively short distances, wigwag is designed to maximise the distance covered\u2014up to 20 miles in some cases.  Wigwag achieved this by using a large flag\u2014a single flag can be held with both hands unlike flag semaphore which has a flag in each hand\u2014and using motions rather than positions as its symbols since motions are more easily seen.  It was invented by US Army surgeon [[Albert J. Myer]] in the 1850s who later became the first head of the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]].  Wigwag was used extensively during the [[American Civil War]] where it filled a gap left by the electrical telegraph.  Although the electrical telegraph had been in use for more than a decade, the network did not yet reach everywhere and portable, ruggedized equipment suitable for military use was not immediately available.  Permanent or semi-permanent stations were established during the war, some of them towers of enormous height and the system for a while could be described as a communications network.<ref>Rebecca Raines, [https://history.army.mil/html/books/030/30-17-1/CMH_Pub_30-17-1.pdf ''Getting the Message Through''], US Government Printing Office, 1996 {{isbn|0160872812}}.</ref><ref>Albert J.

The idea for a telegraph of this type was first proposed as a modification of surveying equipment ([[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], 1821). Various uses of mirrors were made for communication in the following years, mostly for military purposes, but the first device to become widely used was a heliograph with a moveable mirror ([[Henry Christopher Mance|Mance]], 1869). The system was used by the French during the [[Siege of Paris (1870\u201371)|1870\u201371 siege of Paris]], with night-time signalling using [[kerosene lamp]]s as the source of light. An improved version (Begbie, 1870) was used by British military in many colonial wars, including the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] (1879). At some point, a morse key was added to the apparatus to give the operator the same degree of control as in the electric telegraph.<ref name=Woods2>David L. Woods, \"Heliograph and mirrors\", pp. 208-211 in, Christopher H. Sterling (ed), ''Military Communications: From Ancient Times to the 21st Century'', ABC-CLIO, 2008 {{ISBN|1851097325}}.</ref>\n\nAnother type of heliograph was the [[heliostat]] fitted with a Colomb shutter. The heliostat was essentially a surveying instrument with a fixed mirror and so could not transmit a code by itself. The term ''heliostat'' is sometimes used as a synonym for ''heliograph'' because of this origin. The Colomb shutter ([[Francis Bolton|Bolton]] and [[Philip Howard Colomb|Colomb]], 1862) was originally invented to enable the transmission of morse code by [[signal lamp]] between [[Royal Navy]] ships at sea.<ref name=Woods2/>\n\nThe heliograph was heavily used by [[Nelson A. Miles]] in [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]] after he took over command (1886) of the fight against [[Geronimo]] and other [[Apache]] bands in the [[Apache Wars]]. Miles had previously set up the first heliograph line in the US between [[Fort Keogh]] and [[Fort Custer (Montana)|Fort Custer]] in [[Montana]]. He used the heliograph to fill in vast, thinly populated areas that were not covered by the electric telegraph. Twenty-six stations covered an area 200 by 300 miles. In a test of the system, a message was relayed 400 miles in four hours. Miles' enemies used [[smoke signal]]s and flashes of sunlight from metal, but lacked a sophisticated telegraph code.<ref>Nelson A. Miles, ''Personal Recollections and Observations of General Nelson A. Miles'', vol. 2, pp. 481-484, University of Nebraska Press, 1992 {{ISBN|0803281811}}.</ref> The heliograph was ideal for use in the American Southwest due to its clear air and mountainous terrain on which stations could be located. It was found necessary to lengthen the morse dash (which is much shorter in American Morse code than in the modern International Morse code) to aid differentiating from the morse dot.<ref name=Woods2/>\n\nUse of the heliograph declined from 1915 onwards, but remained in service in Britain and [[British Commonwealth]] countries for some time. Australian forces used the heliograph as late as 1942 in the [[Western Desert Campaign]] of [[World War II]].

The economic advantage of doing this is greatest on long, busy routes where the cost of the extra step of preparing the tape is outweighed by the cost of providing more telegraph lines. The first machine to use punched tape was Bain's teleprinter (Bain, 1843), but the system saw only limited use.

''Communication as Culture'', Routledge, New York and London, p. 210</ref>\n\nThere was some fear of the new technology. According to author Allan J. Kimmel, some people \"feared that the telegraph would erode the quality of public discourse through the transmission of irrelevant, context-free information.\" [[Henry David Thoreau]] thought of the Transatlantic cable \"...perchance the first news that will leak through into the broad flapping American ear will be that Princess Adelaide has the whooping cough.\" Kimmel says these fears anticipate many of the characteristics of the modern internet age.<ref>Allan J.

The telegraph had an enormous effect on three industries; finance, newspapers, and railways. Telegraphy facilitated the growth of organizations \"in the railroads, consolidated financial and commodity markets, and reduced information costs within and between firms\".<ref name=\"eh.net\"/> In the US, there were 200 to 300 stock exchanges before the telegraph, but most of these were unnecessary and unprofitable once the telegraph made financial transactions at a distance easy and drove down transaction costs.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/>{{rp|274-275}} This immense growth in the business sectors influenced society to embrace the use of telegrams once the cost had fallen.\n\nWorldwide telegraphy changed the gathering of information for news reporting. Journalists were using the telegraph for war reporting as early as 1846 when the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] broke out. News agencies were formed, such as the [[Associated Press]], for the purpose of reporting news by telegraph.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/>{{rp|274-275}} Messages and information would now travel far and wide, and the telegraph demanded a language \"stripped of the local, the regional; and colloquial\", to better facilitate a worldwide media language.<ref name=\"Carey, James 1989 p. 210\"/> Media language had to be standardized, which led to the gradual disappearance of different forms of speech and styles of [[journalism]] and storytelling.\n\nThe spread of the railways created a need for an accurate [[standard time]] to replace local arbitrary standards based on local [[noon]]. The means of achieving this synchronisation was the telegraph. This emphasis on precise time has led to major societal changes such as the concept of the [[time value of money]].<ref name=\"Phillips\"/>{{rp|273-274}}\n\nThe shortage of men to work as telegraph operators in the [[American Civil War]] opened up the opportunity for women of a well-paid skilled job.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/>{{rp|274}}\n\nThe economic impact of the telegraph was not much studied by economic historians until parallels started to be drawn with the rise of the internet. In fact, the electric telegraph was as important as the invention of printing in this respect. According to economist Ronnie J.

The Club meets and hands their money over to Mel, and in thanks he reads a passage from his book. Ken arrives at the Book Club and exposes Mel for the fraud that he is. Mel's real name is in fact Lionel Hipkiss and he has pulled scams like this at book clubs all over the country. Emily, Blanche, Roy, Rita, Audrey and Norris are shocked and demand their money back.

Mel is about to leave, having stolen some of Emily's ornaments, when Norris tells him his idea of raising money for his book. Mel secretly replaces the ornaments, and agrees to stay.\n\nNorris then gets everyone at the Book Club except Ken to agree to put in \u00a3200 to pay for the publishing of Mel's ''The Canary's Last Song''. Ken doesn't trust Mel and resolves to expose him for what he is. Mel tells Norris to get the Book Club members to make their cheques out to Lionel Hipkiss, his publisher. The Club meets and hands their money over to Mel, and in thanks he reads a passage from his book. Ken arrives at the Book Club and exposes Mel for the fraud that he is. Mel's real name is in fact Lionel Hipkiss and he has pulled scams like this at book clubs all over the country. Emily, Blanche, Roy, Rita, Audrey and Norris are shocked and demand their money back. Norris manhandles Mel out of the door after he insults them all. None of the Book Club members report Mel to the police, embarrassed that they were taken in by a conman.\n\n==Reception==\n''[[The Guardian]]'' critic [[Grace Dent]] described the character as \"a pretentious bore,\" and praised ''Coronation Street'' for being \"streets ahead.\" In the same article Dent went on to say \"he's unwashed, sleazy and a leading authority on \"the working man\" and his \"daily struggle\", no mean feat considering Mel's spent the past three decades in a dressing gown and flip-flops listening to the [[BBC World Service|World Service]].\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/may/14/tvandradio.theguide2/|title=Grace Dent's World of Lather|last=Dent|first=Grace|date=14 May 2005|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref> During a feature on famous faces in ''Coronation Street'', Tom Cole of the ''[[Radio Times]]'' said McKellen's casting was \"show-stealing\" and \"one in the eye for any snobs who'd call soap operas vulgar or trashy.\"<ref name=\"Cole\">{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-01-27/stellar-street-robert-vaughn-and-other-famous-faces-in-corrie|title=Stellar Street: Robert Vaughn and other famous faces in Corrie|last=Cole|first=Tom|date=27 January 2012|work=[[Radio Times]]|publisher=[[BBC Magazines]]|accessdate=21 February 2012}}</ref> Cole added \"Playing smooth-talking conman Mel Hutchwright, McKellen's performance in Corrie was as enchanting as a kaleidoscope and intoxicating as a fine single malt.\"<ref name=\"Cole\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Coronation Street characters|past}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hutchwright, Mel}}\n[[Category:Coronation Street characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional con artists]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2005]]\n[[Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "Conquistador2k6", "label": "safe", "comment": "citation needed? citation granted!", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Hutchwright"}
