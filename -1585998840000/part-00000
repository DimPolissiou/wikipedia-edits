{"title_page": "Music censorship", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2016}}\n'''Censorship of music''' refers to the practice of editing of [[music|musical works]] for various reasons, stemming from a wide variety of motivations, including moral, political, or religious reasons. Censorship can range from the complete government-enforced legal prohibition of a musical work, to private, voluntary removal of content when a musical work appears in a certain context.\n\n==Motivations==\n===Decency===\nSongs are commonly edited for broadcast on [[radio]] and [[television]] to remove content that may be considered objectionable to an outlet's [[target audience]]\u2014such as [[profanity]], or references to subjects such as [[sexual activity|sex]] and [[recreational drug|drug usage]]. This is typically done to comply with any relevant [[broadcast law]] or [[codes of conduct]], and to make the songs more marketable to a mainstream audience.<ref name=MIAcensdoubstandard/><ref name=\"npr-artofclean\"/> Songs edited for content in this manner by are often referred to as a \"[[clean version]]\" or a \"[[radio edit]]\" (the latter also referring to songs that may be edited for length on radio airplay\u2014a practice which dates back to the space limitations of 45 RPM [[vinyl record]]s).<ref name=cp-attentionspans>{{cite news|title=QuickHitz offers radio hit parade edited for short attention spans|url=https://theprovince.com/news/QuickHitz+offers+radio+parade+edited+short+attention+spans/10102495/story.html|accessdate=20 August 2014|agency=Canadian Press}}</ref><ref name=\"bbc-relaxban\">{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3395823.stm|title=Banned on the run|website=BBC News|access-date=2017-06-30}}</ref> Common editing techniques include distorting vocals to obscure offending words (including muting, [[bleep censor|bleeping]], and [[backmasking]]), or replacing them with alternative lyrics.<ref name=\"guardian-sandm\">{{cite news|last=Ewing|first=Tom|title=How pop is provoking the censors again|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/feb/09/rihanna-lyrics-censorship-radio-one|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=July 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe amount of censorship required may vary between broadcasters, depending on [[standards and practices]] and their target audience; for example, [[Radio Disney]] imposes stricter content guidelines than conventional U.S. radio stations, as it primarily targets a youth audience and family listening.<ref name=\"bbc-relaxban\"/><ref name=\"npr-artofclean\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/11/08/454606994/the-art-of-the-clean-version|title=The Art Of The 'Clean Version'|work=[[All Things Considered]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en}}</ref> By contrast, some radio stations may relegate unedited versions of tracks containing objectionable content to airplay during [[Watershed (broadcasting)|time periods deemed appropriate]], such as late-night hours.<ref name=\"bbc-relaxban\"/> Joel Mullis, an Atlanta sound engineer who became well-known in the industry for his work on radio edits, noted that his job was often complicated by differing standards between broadcasters (such as [[BET]] and [[MTV]]), requiring different edits to meet their individual needs.

Those caught listening to ''yellow music'' after North and South Vietnam were reunified would be punished, and their music would be confiscated and destroyed. Many South Vietnamese artists migrated to the United States, and continued to record in exile.

However, this policy was historically treated as a recommendation and generally unenforced, with no clear legal authority of the FDA in this area.

However, this policy was historically treated as a recommendation and generally unenforced, with no clear legal authority of the FDA in this area.

It is the sixth<ref>cfcc.edu</ref> largest community college in the state with nearly 23,000 students taking classes each year. The service area of Cape Fear Community College includes [[New Hanover County, North Carolina|New Hanover]] and [[Pender County, North Carolina|Pender]] counties with a main campus located in downtown Wilmington and satellite campuses in [[Castle Hayne, NC|Castle Hayne]], [[Burgaw, NC|Burgaw]], and [[Surf City, NC|Surf City]].\n\n==Campuses==\n\n=== Downtown Wilmington Campus===\nIt was decided that the institute\u2019s new facilities would be located in downtown Wilmington as part of a $58.8 million project to bring new life to the riverfront. The first buildings downtown opened in 1967. The new facilities allowed Cape Fear Tech to expand its offerings to include new programs and enroll more students in the programs with high demand.\n\nIn the general election of 1972, the citizens of New Hanover County approved another bond issue for $3,675,000 for the expansion of the College\u2019s facilities. This resulted in a seven-story building that provided additional classrooms, shop, and office space, with one floor devoted to the library.\n\nIn 1982 the New Hanover County Commissioners responded favorably to a request made by the Board of Trustees to purchase and renovate a facility to house second year electronic and instrumentation technologies curricula. The building, located three blocks from the main campus, was renovated to meet the needs of the two curricula at a total cost to the County of $300,000. Computer Engineering Technology was later offered in the same building.\n\nIn 2013, the college opened the doors of Union Station.\n\n===North Campus===\nIn 1998, the college purchased land (145 acres) in the northern part of New Hanover County. The first building on the North Campus, the McKeithan Center, opened in the fall of 2002 and the second building, Applied Technologies, opened in the fall of 2005.\n\nIn 2008, a partnership between New Hanover County, the City of Wilmington, and Cape Fear Community College resulted in the construction of a $10,500,000 Safety Training Center on a 14-acre site at the North Campus for in-service training of fire, rescue, and law enforcement personnel. The facility includes a seven-story drill tower, a residential burn building, a commercial burn building, a tear gas building, a classroom building, drafting pits for testing pumpers, an open burn pad, and a truck driver training off-road range.\n\nIn 2009, a 30,000 square-foot building was added at the North Campus with the ground floor of the two-story structure designated for the Wilmington Early College program and the remaining space allotted for Cosmetology, Nail Technology, and Esthetics.\n\nIn 2017, a multi-building Advanced and Emerging Technologies Center opened at the North Campus.\n\n===Alston W. Burke Surf City===\nIn 2009, Mr. Alston Burke, a retired educator, and longtime Pender County resident, donated 25 acres for a campus for the College in Surf City. The appraisal value of the gift exceeded $1.8 million, and CFCC named the campus in honor of Mr. Burke.\n\nIn 2011, a $2.3 million building was approved by the Board of Trustees for the Alston Burke Campus in Surf City, NC, the first such facilities to be constructed on this new location. The first building at the Alston W. Burke Campus was named after Surf City Mayor A.D. \u201cZander\u201d Guy.\n\n===Burgaw Center===\nIn 1990, Cape Fear Community College opened a satellite center in Burgaw offering curriculum and continuing education courses.\n\n==History==\nFounded in 1958 as one of the Industrial Education Centers around the state, The Wilmington Industrial Education Center (WEIC) offered courses for high school students during the day and classes for adults at night. The 32,000-square-foot facility included shop areas, classrooms, chemistry labs, physics labs, a library, and a small administrative office.\n\nFollowing the 1963 Community College Act,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nccommunitycolleges.edu/mission-history |title=Mission & History|access-date=3 February 2020}}</ref> the WIEC officially transformed into Cape Fear Technical Institute (CFTI). With the strong support of the local industry as well as the Chamber of Commerce Committee of 100 and the Merchant\u2019s Association, a $575,000 bond issue was proposed to match federal funds for building new facilities to be used exclusively by the Industrial Center. The first buildings downtown opened in 1967. The new facilities allowed Cape Fear Tech to expand its offerings to include new programs and enroll more students in the programs with high demand.\n\nTo more clearly reflect its expanded role and mission, the Board of Trustees later recommended that the school again change its name. The New Hanover County Commissioners concurred with the Board, and on January 1, 1988, the institution officially became Cape Fear Community College (CFCC).\n\nThroughout the 1990s and into the 21st century, CFCC has doubled its academic offerings and its facilities to keep pace with the dramatic growth of the area and the increasing job training needs of employers and new industries moving to the area.\n\nWith the support of local taxpayers, CFCC opened a new campus in northern New Hanover County in 2002 and is currently expanding in both New Hanover and Pender counties to serve the needs of its citizens and businesses.\n\n=== Accreditation ===\nIn 1969 the College was granted status as a Special Purpose Institute by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The following year the Commission on Colleges granted membership to the College contingent upon successfully completing a self-study within the next five years. This was accomplished and at the Association\u2019s meeting in 1975, the College was granted membership status. In December 1986, in 1996, and again in June of 2007, the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools reaffirmed its accreditation of Cape Fear Community College.\n\n===Scandals===\nIn recent years, in spite of accolades recognizing exceptional faculty, staff, and degree programs,<ref>{{cite web |last1=WWAY News |title=CFCC ranked #1 in NC for associate nursing degrees |url=https://www.wwaytv3.com/2019/12/17/cfcc-ranked-1-in-nc-for-associate-nursing-degrees/ |website=WWAY}}</ref> the college has dealt with multiple scandals associated with the Board of Trustees, past college president Ted Spring, and current president Jim Morton.\n\nTed Spring was hired in November, 2012.

She was forced to resign shortly afterwards. Following her resignation, and without an exhaustive search, the Board of Trustees installed interim president Jim Morton as college president. Jim Morton was given the top job in spite of the fact that he had no higher-education experience prior to his hiring to CFCC in 2015. The Board voted in 2018 not to conduct a search for a new college president, with all members of the Board of Trustees voting for Mr. Morton with the exception of Jonathan Barfield, William Turner, and John Melia.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Nunn |first1=Cece |title=CFCC Officials Forgo Search For President, Vote for Job To Go To Interim Jim Morton |url=http://www.wilmingtonbiz.com/education/2018/03/23/cfcc-officials-forgo-search-for-president-vote-for-job-to-go-to-interim-jim-morton/17268 |accessdate=14 January 2020 |agency=Wilmington Biz |date=23 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn spite of his lack of higher-education experience, and the fact that he is the only community college president in North Carolina who only holds a Bachelor's degree, Morton was given a raise over his predecessor and was given control of the college.

The service area of Cape Fear Community College includes [[New Hanover County, North Carolina|New Hanover]] and [[Pender County, North Carolina|Pender]] counties with a main campus located in downtown Wilmington and satellite campuses in [[Castle Hayne, NC|Castle Hayne]], [[Burgaw, NC|Burgaw]], and [[Surf City, NC|Surf City]].\n\n==Campuses==\n\n=== Downtown Wilmington Campus===\nIt was decided that the institute\u2019s new facilities would be located in downtown Wilmington as part of a $58.8 million project to bring new life to the riverfront. The first buildings downtown opened in 1967. The new facilities allowed Cape Fear Tech to expand its offerings to include new programs and enroll more students in the programs with high demand.\n\nIn the general election of 1972, the citizens of New Hanover County approved another bond issue for $3,675,000 for the expansion of the College\u2019s facilities. This resulted in a seven-story building that provided additional classrooms, shop, and office space, with one floor devoted to the library.\n\nIn 1982 the New Hanover County Commissioners responded favorably to a request made by the Board of Trustees to purchase and renovate a facility to house second year electronic and instrumentation technologies curricula. The building, located three blocks from the main campus, was renovated to meet the needs of the two curricula at a total cost to the County of $300,000. Computer Engineering Technology was later offered in the same building.\n\nIn 2013, the college opened the doors of Union Station.\n\n===North Campus===\nIn 1998, the college purchased land (145 acres) in the northern part of New Hanover County. The first building on the North Campus, the McKeithan Center, opened in the fall of 2002 and the second building, Applied Technologies, opened in the fall of 2005.\n\nIn 2008, a partnership between New Hanover County, the City of Wilmington, and Cape Fear Community College resulted in the construction of a $10,500,000 Safety Training Center on a 14-acre site at the North Campus for in-service training of fire, rescue, and law enforcement personnel. The facility includes a seven-story drill tower, a residential burn building, a commercial burn building, a tear gas building, a classroom building, drafting pits for testing pumpers, an open burn pad, and a truck driver training off-road range.\n\nIn 2009, a 30,000 square-foot building was added at the North Campus with the ground floor of the two-story structure designated for the Wilmington Early College program and the remaining space allotted for Cosmetology, Nail Technology, and Esthetics.\n\nIn 2017, a multi-building Advanced and Emerging Technologies Center opened at the North Campus.\n\n===Alston W. Burke Surf City===\nIn 2009, Mr. Alston Burke, a retired educator, and longtime Pender County resident, donated 25 acres for a campus for the College in Surf City. The appraisal value of the gift exceeded $1.8 million, and CFCC named the campus in honor of Mr. Burke.\n\nIn 2011, a $2.3 million building was approved by the Board of Trustees for the Alston Burke Campus in Surf City, NC, the first such facilities to be constructed on this new location. The first building at the Alston W. Burke Campus was named after Surf City Mayor A.D. \u201cZander\u201d Guy.\n\n===Burgaw Center===\nIn 1990, Cape Fear Community College opened a satellite center in Burgaw offering curriculum and continuing education courses.\n\n==History==\nFounded in 1958 as one of the Industrial Education Centers around the state, The Wilmington Industrial Education Center (WEIC) offered courses for high school students during the day and classes for adults at night. The 32,000-square-foot facility included shop areas, classrooms, chemistry labs, physics labs, a library, and a small administrative office.\n\nFollowing the 1963 Community College Act,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nccommunitycolleges.edu/mission-history |title=Mission & History|access-date=3 February 2020}}</ref> the WIEC officially transformed into Cape Fear Technical Institute (CFTI). With the strong support of the local industry as well as the Chamber of Commerce Committee of 100 and the Merchant\u2019s Association, a $575,000 bond issue was proposed to match federal funds for building new facilities to be used exclusively by the Industrial Center. The first buildings downtown opened in 1967. The new facilities allowed Cape Fear Tech to expand its offerings to include new programs and enroll more students in the programs with high demand.\n\nTo more clearly reflect its expanded role and mission, the Board of Trustees later recommended that the school again change its name. The New Hanover County Commissioners concurred with the Board, and on January 1, 1988, the institution officially became Cape Fear Community College (CFCC).\n\nThroughout the 1990\u2019s and into the 21st century, CFCC has doubled its academic offerings and its facilities to keep pace with the dramatic growth of the area and the increasing job training needs of employers and new industries moving to the area.\n\nWith the support of local taxpayers, CFCC opened a new campus in northern New Hanover County in 2002 and is currently expanding in both New Hanover and Pender counties to serve the needs of its citizens and businesses.\n\n=== Accreditation ===\nIn 1969 the College was granted status as a Special Purpose Institute by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The following year the Commission on Colleges granted membership to the College contingent upon successfully completing a self-study within the next five years. This was accomplished and at the Association\u2019s meeting in 1975, the College was granted membership status. In December 1986, in 1996, and again in June of 2007, the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools reaffirmed its accreditation of Cape Fear Community College.\n\n===Scandals===\nIn recent years, in spite of accolades recognizing exceptional faculty, staff, and degree programs,<ref>{{cite web |last1=WWAY News |title=CFCC ranked #1 in NC for associate nursing degrees |url=https://www.wwaytv3.com/2019/12/17/cfcc-ranked-1-in-nc-for-associate-nursing-degrees/ |website=WWAY}}</ref> the college has dealt with multiple scandals associated with the Board of Trustees, past college president Ted Spring, and current president Jim Morton.\n\nTed Spring was hired in November, 2012.

She was forced to resign shortly afterwards. Following her resignation, and without an exhaustive search, the Board of Trustees installed interim president Jim Morton as college president. Jim Morton was given the top job in spite of the fact that he had no higher-education experience prior to his hiring to CFCC in 2015. The Board voted in 2018 not to conduct a search for a new college president, with all members of the Board of Trustees voting for Mr. Morton with the exception of Jonathan Barfield, William Turner, and John Melia.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Nunn |first1=Cece |title=CFCC Officials Forgo Search For President, Vote for Job To Go To Interim Jim Morton |url=http://www.wilmingtonbiz.com/education/2018/03/23/cfcc-officials-forgo-search-for-president-vote-for-job-to-go-to-interim-jim-morton/17268 |accessdate=14 January 2020 |agency=Wilmington Biz |date=23 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn spite of his lack of higher-education experience, and the fact that he is the only community college president in North Carolina who only holds a Bachelor's degree, Morton was given a raise over his predecessor and was given control of the college.

This case concerned two major issues: whether or not the city's policy regarding the supply of free basic water, 6 kilolitres per month to each account holder in the city was in conflict with Section 27 of the South African Constitution or Section 11 of the Water Services Act.<ref>[http://www.dwaf.gov.za/Documents/Legislature/a108-97.pdf], South African Water Services Act.

Further, as the meters halted supply of water to residence once the free basic water supply had ended, this was deemed an unlawful discontinuation of the water supply.

Therefore the having access to pure and adequate quantity of water is the inalienable human right. Hence, the [[Eco Needs Foundation]] (ENF) deems it necessary to recognise the right to water (with ensured per capita minimum quantity of water) through the appropriate expressed legal provision. The [[United Nations]] with its several covenants has made it obligatory for all the nations to ensure equitable distribution of water amongst all the citizens. Accordingly, the ENF began to observe and promote the celebration of [[World Rights to Water Day]] on 20 March, the date on which Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar (\"the father of modern India\") led the world's first [[satyagraha]] for water in 1927. The World Right to Water Day calls for the adoption of special legislation establishing the universal right to water. Under the guidance of founder Dr [[Priyanand Agale]], the ENF arranges a variety of several programmes to ensure the right to water for Indian citizens.<ref>econeeds.org</ref>\n\n===New Zealand===\nESCR are not explicitly protected in New Zealand at the current time, either by the Human Rights or Bill of Rights Acts, therefore the right to water is not defended by law there.<ref>Natalie Baird and Diana Pickard, [http://www.kaupapature.org.nz/store/doc/Pickard_-_Poole.pdf \"Economic, social and cultural rights: a proposal for a constitutional peg in the ground\"], [2013] NZLJ 289 at 299</ref> The New Zealand Law Society has recently indicated that this country would give further consideration to the legal status of economic, social and cultural rights.<ref>[http://www.lawsociety.org.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/76530/l-HR-Committee-ICCPR-List-of-Issues-Prior-to-Reporting-5-3-14-with-annexure,-UPR-submission-17-6-13.pdf], New Zealand Law Society Human Rights & Privacy Committee, Submission to the 18th Session of The Human Rights Council, Shadow Report to New Zealnd's 2nd Universal Periodic Review</ref>\n\n===United States===\nIn ''Pilchen v. City of Auburn, New York'', a single mother named Diane Pilchen was living as a rental tenant in a foreclosed house, in which the owner (landlord) of the house had failed to pay the water bill for some time.  The City of Auburn billed Pilchen for the landlord's arrears, and repeatedly shut her water service off without notice when she couldn't pay these debts, making the house uninhabitable.  The city condemned the home and forced Pilchen and her child to move out.  Pilchen was represented by the Public Utility Law Project of New York (PULP) in the lawsuit.  The City of Auburn attempted unsuccessfully to argue that water is not a constitutional right because bottled water could be used instead, an argument that was contested by PULP as absurd. In 2010, Pilchen won summary judgment in which it was determined that shutting off the water violated her constitutional rights, and that Pilchen could not be billed and stopped from having water due to an unrelated party's delays in paying water bills.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pulpnetwork.blogspot.com/2010/08/city-of-auburn-violated-tenants.html|title=NEW YORK'S UTILITY PROJECT : City of Auburn Violated Tenant's Constitutional Rights in Denial and Termination of Water Service|last=Norlander|first=Gerry|date=2010-08-05|website=NEW YORK'S UTILITY PROJECT|access-date=2019-06-17}}</ref><ref>http://www.leagle.com/decision/In%20FDCO%2020100806950/PILCHEN%20v.%20CITY%20OF%20AUBURN,%20N.Y.</ref>\n\n== Remaining discussions ==\n\n=== Transboundary effects ===\nGiven the fact that access to water is a cross-border source of concern and potential conflict in the [[Middle East]], the Eastern [[Mediterranean]] and parts of [[North America]] amongst other places, some non-governmental organizations ([[NGO]]s) and scholars argue that the right to water also has a trans-national or extraterritorial aspect. They argue that given the fact that water supplies naturally overlap and cross borders, states also have a legal obligation not to act in a way that might have a negative effect on the enjoyment of human rights in other states.<ref>Hausmann, Ute, Globalising economic and social human rights by strengthening extraterritorial state obligations (Brot f\u00fcr die Welt, FIAN and CEED, October 2006), available at: http://fian.org/resources/documents/others/germanys-extraterritorial-human-rights-obligations-in-multilateral-development-banks/pdf</ref> The formal acknowledgement of this legal obligation could prevent the negative effects of the global \"water crunch\" (as a future threat and one negative result of human [[over-population]]).[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/civilsociety/articles/pp091805.shtml]\nWater shortages and increasing consumption of freshwater make this right incredibly complicated.

Market environmentalism uses the markets as a solution to environmental problems such as [[environmental degradation]] and an inefficient use of resources. Supporters of market [[environmentalism]] believe that the managing of water as an economic good by private companies will be more effective than political accountability by citizens through their representatives. The opponents believe that the consequence of water being a human right excludes private sector involvement and requires that water should be given to all people because it is essential to life. Access to water as a human right is used by some NGOs as a means to combat privatization efforts. A human right to water \"generally rests on two justifications: the non-substitutability of drinking water (\"essential for life\"), and the fact that many other human rights which are explicitly recognized in the UN Conventions are predicated upon an (assumed) availability of water (e.g. the [[right to food]]).\"<ref name=\"ref4\">Bakker, Karen. \"The \u201cCommons\u201d Versus the \u201cCommodity\u201d: Alter\u2010globalization, Anti\u2010privatization and the Human Right to Water in the Global South\".

This contract was for the operation and management of the Dar es Salaam water system. In May 2005, the Tanzania government ended the contract with Biwater Gauff for its alleged failure to meet performance guarantees.  in July 2008, the Tribunal issued its decision on the case, declaring that the Tanzania government had violated the agreement with Biwater Gauff.<ref>[http://www.business-humanrights.org/Categories/Lawlawsuits/Lawsuitsregulatoryaction/LawsuitsSelectedcases/Biwater-Tanzaniaarbitration],  Business & Human RIghts Resource Centre, Biwater-Tanzania arbitration.</ref> It did not however award monetary damages to Biwater, acknowledging that public interest concerns were paramount in the dispute.\n\n== Right to water in domestic law ==\nWithout the existence of an international body that can enforce it, the human right to water relies upon the activity of national courts.<ref>[http://lawecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1020&context=lucilr],  McGraw, George S. \"Defining and Defending the Right to Water and its Minimum Core: Legal Construction and the Role of National Jurisprudence\" ''Loyola University Chicago International Law Review'' Vol. 8, No. 2, 127-204 (2011) at 137.</ref> The basis for this has been established through the constitutionalisation of economic, social and cultural Rights ([[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ESCR]]) through one of two means: as \"directive principles\" that are goals and are often non-justiciable; or as expressly protected and enforceable through the courts.<ref>[http://www.kaupapature.org.nz/store/doc/Pickard_-_Poole.pdf], Natalie Baird and Diana Pickard \"Economic, social and cultural rights: a proposal for a constitutional peg in the ground\" [2013] NZLJ 289 at 297</ref>\n\n=== South Africa ===\nIn [[South Africa]], the right to water is enshrined in the [[Constitution of South Africa|constitution]] and implemented by ordinary statutes.

City of Johannesburg''], (06/13865) [2008] ZAGPHC 491;[2008] All SA 471 (W) (30 April 2008)</ref> The case revolved around the distribution of water through pipes to Phiri, one of the oldest areas of Soweto. This case concerned two major issues: whether or not the city's policy regarding the supply of free basic water, 6 kilolitres per month to each account holder in the city was in conflict with Section 27 of the South African Constitution or Section 11 of the Water Services Act.<ref>[http://www.dwaf.gov.za/Documents/Legislature/a108-97.pdf], South African Water Services Act. [No. 108 of 1997] Section 11</ref> The second issue being whether or not the installation of pre-paid water meters was lawful.\nIt was held in the [[High Court of South Africa|High Court]] that the city's by-laws did not provide for the installation of meters and that their installation was unlawful. Further, as the meters halted supply of water to residence once the free basic water supply had ended, this was deemed an unlawful discontinuation of the water supply.  The court held the residents of Phiri should be provided with a free basic water supply of 50 litres per person per day.<ref>[http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAGPHC/2008/491.pdf ''Mazibuko v.

The SCA declared that the installation of water meters was illegal, but suspended the order for two years to give the city an opportunity to rectify the situation.<ref>[http://www.saflii.org/cgi-bin/disp.pl?file=za/cases/ZASCA/2009/52.html&query=mazibuko], Mazibuko and Another v National Director of Public Prosecutions (113/08) [2009] ZASCA 52; 2009 (6) SA 479 (SCA) ;  [2009] 3 All SA 548 (SCA) (26 May 2009)</ref>\n\nThe issues went further to the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]], which held that the duty created by the constitution required that the state take reasonable legislative and other measures progressively to realise the achievement of the right to access of water, within its available resource. the Constitutional Court also held that it is a matter for the legislature and executive institution of government to act within the allowance of their budgets and that the scrutiny of their programs is a matter of democratic [[accountability]]. Therefore, the minimum content set out by the regulation 3(b) is constitutional, rendering the bodies to deviate upwards and further it is inappropriate for a court to determine the achievement of any social and economic right the government has taken steps to implement.<ref>[http://www.saflii.org/cgi-bin/disp.pl?file=za/cases/ZACC/2009/28.html&query=mazibuko ''Mazibuko and Other v.

Therefore the having access to pure and adequate quantity of water is the inalienable human right. Hence, the [[Eco Needs Foundation]] (ENF) deems it necessary to recognise the right to water (with ensured per capita minimum quantity of water) through the appropriate expressed legal provision. The [[United Nations]] with its several covenants has made it obligatory for all the nations to ensure equitable distribution of water amongst all the citizens. Accordingly, the ENF began to observe and promote the celebration of [[World Rights to Water Day]] on 20 March, the date on which Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar (\"the father of modern India\") led the world's first [[satyagraha]] for water in 1927. The World Right to Water Day calls for the adoption of special legislation establishing the universal right to water. Under the guidance of founder Dr [[Priyanand Agale]], the ENF arranges a variety of several programmes to ensure the right to water for Indian citizens.<ref>econeeds.org</ref>\n\n===New Zealand===\nESCR are not explicitly protected in New Zealand at the current time, either by the Human Rights or Bill of Rights Acts, therefore the right to water is not defended by law there.<ref>Natalie Baird and Diana Pickard, [http://www.kaupapature.org.nz/store/doc/Pickard_-_Poole.pdf \"Economic, social and cultural rights: a proposal for a constitutional peg in the ground\"], [2013] NZLJ 289 at 299</ref> The New Zealand Law Society has recently indicated that this country would give further consideration to the legal status of economic, social and cultural rights.<ref>[http://www.lawsociety.org.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/76530/l-HR-Committee-ICCPR-List-of-Issues-Prior-to-Reporting-5-3-14-with-annexure,-UPR-submission-17-6-13.pdf], New Zealand Law Society Human Rights & Privacy Committee, Submission to the 18th Session of The Human Rights Council, Shadow Report to New Zealnd's 2nd Universal Periodic Review</ref>\n\n===United States===\nIn ''Pilchen v. City of Auburn, New York'', a single mother named Diane Pilchen was living as a rental tenant in a foreclosed house, in which the owner (landlord) of the house had failed to pay the water bill for some time.  The City of Auburn billed Pilchen for the landlord's arrears, and repeatedly shut her water service off without notice when she couldn't pay these debts, making the house uninhabitable.  The city condemned the home and forced Pilchen and her child to move out.  Pilchen was represented by the Public Utility Law Project of New York (PULP) in the lawsuit.  The City of Auburn attempted unsuccessfully to argue that water is not a constitutional right because bottled water could be used instead, an argument that was contested by PULP as absurd. In 2010, Pilchen won summary judgment in which it was determined that shutting off the water violated her constitutional rights, and that Pilchen could not be billed and stopped from having water due to an unrelated party's delays in paying water bills.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pulpnetwork.blogspot.com/2010/08/city-of-auburn-violated-tenants.html|title=NEW YORK'S UTILITY PROJECT : City of Auburn Violated Tenant's Constitutional Rights in Denial and Termination of Water Service|last=Norlander|first=Gerry|date=2010-08-05|website=NEW YORK'S UTILITY PROJECT|access-date=2019-06-17}}</ref><ref>http://www.leagle.com/decision/In%20FDCO%2020100806950/PILCHEN%20v.%20CITY%20OF%20AUBURN,%20N.Y.</ref>\n\n== Remaining discussions ==\n\n=== Transboundary effects ===\nGiven the fact that access to water is a cross-border source of concern and potential conflict in the [[Middle East]], the Eastern [[Mediterranean]] and parts of [[North America]] amongst other places, some non-governmental organizations ([[NGO]]s) and scholars argue that the right to water also has a trans-national or extraterritorial aspect. They argue that given the fact that water supplies naturally overlap and cross borders, states also have a legal obligation not to act in a way that might have a negative effect on the enjoyment of human rights in other states.<ref>Hausmann, Ute, Globalising economic and social human rights by strengthening extraterritorial state obligations (Brot f\u00fcr die Welt, FIAN and CEED, October 2006), available at: http://fian.org/resources/documents/others/germanys-extraterritorial-human-rights-obligations-in-multilateral-development-banks/pdf</ref> The formal acknowledgement of this legal obligation could prevent the negative effects of the global \"water crunch\" (as a future threat and one negative result of human [[over-population]]).[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/civilsociety/articles/pp091805.shtml]\nWater shortages and increasing consumption of freshwater make this right incredibly complicated.

Market environmentalism uses the markets as a solution to environmental problems such as [[environmental degradation]] and an inefficient use of resources. Supporters of market [[environmentalism]] believe that the managing of water as an economic good by private companies will be more effective than political accountability by citizens through their representatives. The opponents believe that the consequence of water being a human right excludes private sector involvement and requires that water should be given to all people because it is essential to life. Access to water as a human right is used by some NGOs as a means to combat privatization efforts. A human right to water \"generally rests on two justifications: the non-substitutability of drinking water (\"essential for life\"), and the fact that many other human rights which are explicitly recognized in the UN Conventions are predicated upon an (assumed) availability of water (e.g. the [[right to food]]).\"<ref name=\"ref4\">Bakker, Karen. \"The \u201cCommons\u201d Versus the \u201cCommodity\u201d: Alter\u2010globalization, Anti\u2010privatization and the Human Right to Water in the Global South\".

This method would skirt the normal process for amending the Canadian Constitution by taking advantage of the less rigorous formula under Section 43 of the [[Constitution Act, 1982|Constitution Act of 1982]]. This method prescribes that portions of the constitution affecting only one province can be amended with the consent of the federal Parliament and the legislature of that province. Thus, it is probable that annexation could be achieved using this method with general public support throughout Canada in addition to support from one willing province, as well as public support in the Turks and Caicos.\n\nThis proposal has already been officially supported by one province, [[Nova Scotia]], in April 2004 when [[Nova scotia legislature|its legislature]] adopted a resolution explicitly inviting the government of the Turks and Caicos to explore joining Canada as a part of that province.

Between 1973 and 1987, members of the territory's legislature met with members of both houses of the Canadian Parliament to discuss the advantages the islands would receive by associating closely with Canada. On March 10, 1987, Liberal Senator and former Cabinet Minister [[Hazen Argue]] tabled a motion calling for both nations to explore \"the desirability and advantages of the Turks and Caicos Islands becoming a part of Canada\".<ref name=\":6\" /> This motion referenced the ongoing talks with members of both countries' legislatures. During debate in the Canadian Senate, Argue identified advantages that the Turks and Caicos legislature saw in association with Canada:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* Greater internal self-government owing to status as a [[Provinces and territories of Canada|territory, part of a province, or as a province in its own right]];\n* Utilisation of the [[Canadian dollar|Canadian Dollar]];\n* Islanders would movement and works rights as Canadian Citizens, compared to the restrictions imposed on them at the time as [[British Overseas citizen]]s;\n* Benefits from Canada's [[Canada\u2013United States relations|relationship]] with the [[United States]];\n* Several benefits stemming from economic integration, such as a reliable domestic tourist market;\n* Domestic access to the Canadian educational system, government assistance programs, and judicial systems.\n\n[[File:Hazen_Argue.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Hazen Argue]], author of a motion in the [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senate]] supporting annexation in 1987.]]\nThe motion also laid out concrete steps that the nations might need to take to move towards integration; the list has since been cited as the steps that both nations would need to take if the process were to be initiated in the future:\n\n{{Quote|text=(1) adoption of a [[Currency union|common currency]];\n(2) designation of Canada's [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]]<nowiki> as the Queen's representative for the islands (thus replacing the current </nowiki>[[Governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands|Governor]]);\n\n(3) a closer [[Economic union|economic association]] between the two countries;\n\n(4) any change in procedures to our mutual advantage, that would assist the entry of Canadians to the Islands, and of Islanders to Canada; and\n(5) provision of efficient direct air service between the two countries.|author=Hazen Argue|title=|source=Senate Debates, 33rd Parliament, 2nd Session : Vol. 1}}Association with Canada reached an all-time peek of support amongst islanders at this time, with around 90% of its citizens supporting it.

This method would skirt the normal process for amending the Canadian Constitution by taking advantage of the less rigorous formula under Section 43 of the [[Constitution Act, 1982|Constitution Act of 1982]]. This method prescribes that portions of the constitution affecting only one province can be amended with the consent of the federal Parliament and the legislature of that province. Thus, it is probable that annexation could be achieved using this method with general public support throughout Canada in addition to support from one willing province, as well as public support in the Turks and Caicos.\n\nThis proposal has already been officially supported by one province, [[Nova Scotia]], in April 2004 when [[Nova scotia legislature|its legislature]] adopted a resolution explicitly inviting the government of the Turks and Caicos to explore joining Canada as a part of that province.
