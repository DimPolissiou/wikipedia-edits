It consists of a [[Sinclair QDOS|QDOS]] compatible SMS kernel, a rewritten [[SuperBASIC]] interpreter called SBasic, a complete set of SuperBASIC procedures and functions and a set of extended device drivers originally written for the QL emulator for the [[Atari ST]].\n\nIt also integrates many extensions previously only available separately for the QL, like Toolkit II (quite essential SuperBASIC add-on), the Pointer Environment (the QL's mouse and [[windowing system]]) and the Hotkey System 2.\n\nWhile SMSQ/E does not run on any unmodified QL, it runs on all of the more advanced QL compatible platforms, from the Miracle Systems (Super)GoldCard CPU plug-in cards to the [[Q60 (motherboard)|Q60]] motherboard.\n\nIn late 1995 a German author, Marcel Kilgus, acquired the SMSQ/E sources for adaptation to his QL emulator QPC, which from then on did not emulate any specific QL hardware anymore but employed specially adapted device drivers to achieve a tighter integration and faster emulation.\n\nIn 2000, version 2.94 was the first QL operating system that broke free of the bounds of the QL 8 colour screen, introducing GD2 (Graphic Device Interface Version 2), a QL compatible 16-bit high colour graphics sub-system.\n\nUp to version 2.99 the system was exclusively developed by Tony Tebby and Marcel Kilgus. In 2002, Mr Tebby released all of his source code (which doesn't include most QPC specific parts), albeit under a license which is not [[Open Source]] under the [[Open Source Definition]].\nWith this step Tony Tebby finally left the QL scene, but development by volunteers continues to this day.\n\nIn early 2013 the current source code was re-released under the BSD license.\n\nCurrently{{when|date=January 2017}} SMSQ/E consists of approximately 2000 [[68k]] assembler source files containing about 222,000 lines of code.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120301111437/http://www.jlpaonline.com/?p=53 A Brief History of SMSQ/E]\n*[http://www.wlenerz.com/smsqe/ The official SMSQ/E site Source Code, binaries and documentation]\n*[http://www.kilgus.net/qpc/ QPC: a software emulator for DOS/Windows that employs SMSQ/E]\n*[http://www.q40.de/ Q40/Q60: a 68040/68060 based motherboard for SMSQ/E]\n*[http://www.wlenerz.com/SMSQmulator/ SMSQmulator - Java based virtual QL machine running SMSQ/E]\n*[http://sinclairql.net/repository.html#QLE QL/E The QL runtime Environment with SMSQ/E]\n*[http://www.sinclairql.net/repository.html#TheDistribution The Distribution, 4.7 GB of QL related documents, software (incl. all SMSQ/E editions) and pictures]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:SMSQ E}}\n[[Category:Discontinued operating systems]]\n[[Category:Atari operating systems]]\n[[Category:Atari ST software]]\n[[Category:Software using the BSD license]]\n", "name_user": "Vezhlys", "label": "safe", "comment": "forgot to update the date", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMSQ/E"}
