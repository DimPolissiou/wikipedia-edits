His father had inherited (through adoption from his great uncle Sir [[Robert Stewart, 4th Lord of Aubigny|Robert Stewart, 4th Seigneur d'Aubigny]] (c.1470\u20131544)), the French Seigneurie ([[lord of the manor|lordship of the manor]]) of Aubigny and its estates, including the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Aubigny]] at [[Aubigny-sur-N\u00e8re]] in the ancient [[Provinces of France|province]] of [[Berry, France|Berry]], central France, built by him, also the nearby secondary seat of [[Ch\u00e2teau de la Verrerie (Cher)|Ch\u00e2teau de la Verrerie]].\n\n==Career==\nHe spent much of his life in [[France]] and succeeded his father as  6th Seigneur d'Aubigny in 1567.

He was appointed to the  [[Privy Council of Scotland]], was created [[Earl of Lennox]] on 5 March 1580 (which title having been inherited by King James from his paternal grandfather had merged into the crown), and then [[Duke of Lennox]] on 5 August 1581. He was also created [[Earl of Darnley]], Lords Tarboulton and Dalkeith and received other favours.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=420}} During his rise he was careful to maintain his popularity with the Burgh administrators of Scotland's towns. For example in July 1580 the English diplomat [[Robert Bowes (diplomat)|Robert Bowes]] reported that Lennox had obtained fishing rights in [[Aberdeen]], which the deposed [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton|Regent Morton]] had given to his servant George Affleck of Balmanno, and had then arranged for the King to give this valuable source of income to the town.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 5 (1907), p. 461, no. 536.</ref>\n\nIn [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] Scotland, the thought of a Catholic duke irked many, and Lennox had to make a choice between his Catholic faith and his loyalty to the king. Lennox chose the latter, who taught him the doctrines of [[Calvinism]]. Neverthess the [[Church of Scotland]] remained suspicious of Lennox after his public conversion and took alarm when he had the Earl of Morton tried and beheaded on charges of [[treason]].\n\n==Ruthven Raid and exile==\nIn response the Scottish nobles plotted to oust Lennox. They did so by luring James to [[Huntingtower Castle|Ruthven Castle]] as a guest where they kept him as prisoner for ten months. The Lord Enterprisers then forced James to banish Lennox. A lengthy denunciation of Lennox was issued from [[Stirling Castle]] on 17 September 1582, citing his religion, association with the murderers of [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]] (King James's father) and [[Regent Moray]] and [[Regent Lennox]] and his control over the royal household and international intrigue.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Scotland'', vol. 6, (1910), 171-174.</ref> Lennox stayed for a while at [[Dumbarton Castle]].

He met a frosty reception in France as an [[apostate]]. Although the Scottish nobles believed that they would be proved right in their belief that Lennox's conversion was artificial following his return France, he remained a Presbyterian.\n\n==Death in Paris==\nHe died in Paris on 26 May 1583. His final letter to [[James Stewart, 1st Lord Doune|James Stewart, Lord Doune]], requested him to take care of his son and to recover his former possessions in Scotland for his benefit.<ref>''HMC 6th Report: Earl of Moray'' (LOndon, 1877), p. 637, (Letter dated Paris NS, 4 June 1583).</ref> [[William Schaw]] took his heart back to King James in Scotland, followed by his wife and eldest son Ludovic Stewart. King James had repeatedly vouched for Lennox's religious sincerity and memorialized him in a poem called \"Ane Tragedie of the Phoenix\", which compared him to an exotic bird of unique beauty killed by envy. King James I regarded all Lennox's family with great affection, and instructed his son King Charles I to do well by them. Charles faithfully fulfilled this obligation, and as a result the Lennox family had considerable influence at the Scottish and English Courts over the next two generations.\n\n==Marriage & issue==\nIn about 1572 he married Catherine de Balsac (d.post-1630), a daughter of Guillaume de Balsac, Sieur d'Entragues, by his wife Louise d'Humi\u00e8res.

His father had inherited (through adoption from his great uncle Sir [[Robert Stewart, 4th Lord of Aubigny|Robert Stewart, 4th Seigneur d'Aubigny]] (c.1470\u20131544)), the French Seigneurie ([[lord of the manor|lordship of the manor]]) of Aubigny and its estates, including the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Aubigny]] at [[Aubigny-sur-N\u00e8re]] in the ancient [[Provinces of France|province]] of [[Berry, France|Berry]], central France, built by him, also the nearby secondary seat of [[Ch\u00e2teau de la Verrerie (Cher)|Ch\u00e2teau de la Verrerie]].\n\n==Career==\nHe spent much of his life in [[France]] and succeeded his father as  6th Seigneur d'Aubigny in 1567. At the age of 37 he came to Scotland, where he was introduced to his first cousin once removed, the 13-year-old [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland]], when the latter made his formal entry into [[Edinburgh]] and began his personal rule. Esm\u00e9 was an exotic visitor who fascinated the young James,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=zC74dutk7bQC&pg=PT860&lpg=PT860&dq=Esm%C3%A9+Stewart,+1st+Duke+of+Lennox&source=bl&ots=hVTx8NgqWk&sig=RqKlMtz19SgFG1CCa-gWtPuh_Dw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=TwyRU9bIEcWcyAScuYCYDQ&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&q=Esm%C3%A9%20Stewart%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Lennox&f=false ''A Dictionary of British History'', ed.

He was appointed to the  [[Privy Council of Scotland]], was created [[Earl of Lennox]] on 5 March 1580 (which title having been inherited by King James from his paternal grandfather had merged into the crown), and then [[Duke of Lennox]] on 5 August 1581. He was also created [[Earl of Darnley]], Lords Tarboulton and Dalkeith and received other favours.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=420}} During his rise he was careful to maintain his popularity with the Burgh administrators of Scotland's towns. For example in July 1580 the English diplomat [[Robert Bowes (diplomat)|Robert Bowes]] reported that Lennox had obtained fishing rights in [[Aberdeen]], which the deposed [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton|Regent Morton]] had given to his servant George Affleck of Balmanno, and had then arranged for the King to give this valuable source of income to the town.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 5 (1907), p. 461, no. 536.</ref>\n\nIn [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] Scotland, the thought of a Catholic duke irked many, and Lennox had to make a choice between his Catholic faith and his loyalty to the king. Lennox chose the latter, who taught him the doctrines of [[Calvinism]]. Neverthess the [[Church of Scotland]] remained suspicious of Lennox after his public conversion and took alarm when he had the Earl of Morton tried and beheaded on charges of [[treason]].\n\n==Ruthven Raid and exile==\nIn response the Scottish nobles plotted to oust Lennox. They did so by luring James to [[Huntingtower Castle|Ruthven Castle]] as a guest where they kept him as prisoner for ten months. The Lord Enterprisers then forced James to banish Lennox. A lengthy denunciation of Lennox was issued from [[Stirling Castle]] on 17 September 1582, citing his religion, association with the murderers of [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]] (King James's father) and [[Regent Moray]] and [[Regent Lennox]] and his control over the royal household and international intrigue.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Scotland'', vol. 6, (1910), 171-174.</ref> Lennox stayed for a while at [[Dumbarton Castle]]. In December whilst travelling south from [[Berwick on Tweed]], by chance near [[Northallerton]] he encountered the French ambassador, M. de la Mothe F\u00e9nelon, who was travelling northward to treat with the [[Raid of Ruthven|Gowrie Regime]]. In London the Scottish poet [[William Fowler (makar)|William Fowler]] pumped him{{cn|date=February 2020|who?}} for information which he sent to [[Francis Walsingham]].<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Scotland'', vol. 6, (1910), 235, 240-3, 256-7, 262-3, 265-6.</ref>\n\n==Return to France==\nLennox returned to France where he started a secret correspondence with King James. He met a frosty reception in France as an [[apostate]]. Although the Scottish nobles believed that they would be proved right in their belief that Lennox's conversion was artificial following his return France, he remained a Presbyterian.\n\n==Death in Paris==\nHe died in Paris on 26 May 1583. His final letter to James Stewart, Lord Doune, requested him to take care of his son and to recover his  former possessions in Scotland for his benefit.<ref>HMC, ''6th Report: MSS of the Earl of Moray'', (1877) 637, (Letter dated Paris 4 June 1583).</ref> [[William Schaw]] took his heart back to King James in Scotland, followed by his wife and eldest son Ludovic Stewart. King James had repeatedly vouched for Lennox's religious sincerity and memorialized him in a poem called \"Ane Tragedie of the Phoenix\", which compared him to an exotic bird of unique beauty killed by envy. King James I regarded all Lennox's family with great affection, and instructed his son King Charles I to do well by them. Charles faithfully fulfilled this obligation, and as a result the Lennox family had considerable influence at the Scottish and English Courts over the next two generations.\n\n==Marriage & issue==\nIn about 1572 he married Catherine de Balsac (d.post-1630), a daughter of Guillaume de Balsac, Sieur d'Entragues, by his wife Louise d'Humi\u00e8res. Catherine outlived her husband by many years and  spent her later life at the family estate at Aubigny, where she was entrusted with  the upbringing of her grandchildren.

The [[Greater London Council]] withdrew from the Town Development Agreement and the local council continued the development on its own.\n\nThere was the problem of the Western Development and of [[Lydiard Park]] being in the new [[North Wiltshire]] district, but this was resolved by a boundary change to take in part of North Wiltshire. Another factor limiting local decision-taking was the continuing role of [[Wiltshire County Council]] in the administration of Swindon. Together with like-minded councils, a campaign was launched to bring an updated form of [[county borough]] status to Swindon. This was successful in 1997 with the formation of [[Swindon Borough Council]], covering the area of the former Thamesdown and the former Highworth Rural District Council.\n\nThe closure of the railway works (which had been in decline for many years) was a major blow to Swindon.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Because of this and the major growth in population, diversification was continued at a rapid pace and the town now has all the features of a successful urban/rural council in the Outer southeast zone.\n\nIn February 2008 ''[[The Times]]'' named Swindon as one of \"The 20 best places to buy a property in Britain\".<ref>[http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/buying_and_selling/article3327954.ece The 20 best places to buy a property in Britain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509153728/http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/buying_and_selling/article3327954.ece |date=9 May 2008 }}, ''[[The Times]]'', Property pages, February 2008</ref> Only [[Warrington]] had a lower ratio of house prices to household income in 2007, with the average household income in Swindon among the highest in the country.\n\nIn October 2008 Swindon made a controversial move to ban fixed point [[speed cameras]].

The [[Greater London Council]] withdrew from the Town Development Agreement and the local council continued the development on its own.\n\nThere was the problem of the Western Development and of [[Lydiard Park]] being in the new [[North Wiltshire]] district, but this was resolved by a boundary change to take in part of North Wiltshire.

Together with like-minded councils, a campaign was launched to bring an updated form of [[county borough]] status to Swindon. This was successful in 1997 with the formation of [[Swindon Borough Council]], covering the area of the former Thamesdown and the former Highworth Rural District Council.\n\nThe closure of the railway works (which had been in decline for many years) was a major blow to Swindon.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Because of this and the major growth in population, diversification was continued at a rapid pace and the town now has all the features of a successful urban/rural council in the Outer southeast zone.\n\nIn February 2008 ''[[The Times]]'' named Swindon as one of \"The 20 best places to buy a property in Britain\".<ref>[http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/buying_and_selling/article3327954.ece The 20 best places to buy a property in Britain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509153728/http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/buying_and_selling/article3327954.ece |date=9 May 2008 }}, ''[[The Times]]'', Property pages, February 2008</ref> Only [[Warrington]] had a lower ratio of house prices to household income in 2007, with the average household income in Swindon among the highest in the country.\n\nIn October 2008 Swindon made a controversial move to ban fixed point [[speed cameras]].

She begins another day at the diner with her boss Cal and waitresses Becky and Dawn (\"Opening Up\"). After she almost throws up, Becky and Dawn convince her to take a [[pregnancy test]] which, to Jenna's dismay, comes back positive due to a drunken night with her abusive husband, Earl (\"The Negative\"). Earl comes to the diner and suggests he may make Jenna quit and give up her passion for baking. He takes the tips she's earned from working so far that day. She decides not to tell him about the pregnancy and recalls her late mother, who also found solace from an unhappy marriage in baking (\"What Baking Can Do\").\n\nAt her [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|OB/GYN's]] office, Jenna is taunted by other pregnant women (\"Club Knocked Up\") and meets Dr. Jim Pomatter, a new doctor from Connecticut. Jenna explains she does not want her baby but is going to keep it, and leaves Dr. Pomatter with a Mermaid Marshmallow pie, which, despite the fact that he is off sugar, he eats and loves it (\"Pomatter Pie\").\n\nWord of Jenna's pregnancy reaches Joe, the diner's curmudgeonly owner, who suggests she enter a local pie-baking contest with a large reward which would allow her to leave her husband. Dawn has turned to [[Online dating service|online dating]] but is terrified of what could happen (\"When He Sees Me\").\n\nJenna runs into Dr. Pomatter at the bus stop. He compliments her pie, saying it could \"win contests and ribbons and things\". (\"It Only Takes a Taste\"). Jenna arrives home to learn Earl has been fired. He berates her, and his anger almost turns physical until she confesses she is pregnant. He makes her promise not to love the baby more than him (\"You Will Still Be Mine\"). Jenna tells Dawn and Becky her plan to enter the pie contest and use the winnings to leave Earl for a new life with the baby. The three waitresses see their dreams of a better life within reach (\"A Soft Place to Land\"). Jenna begins to give Earl only half her earnings, hiding the other half around the house in order to save up for entering the pie contest.\n\nDawn's date Ogie visits the diner and insists he get to know Dawn better (\"Never Ever Getting Rid of Me\"). Dawn and Ogie realize they both enjoy [[American Revolution]] [[Historical reenactment|reenactments]] and how much they have in common. Jenna makes an appointment with Dr. Pomatter, where she impulsively kisses him. Though both are married, they decide to escape their frustrating lives, and have sex in his office (\"Bad Idea\").\n\n=== Act II ===\nAfter her tryst, Jenna discovers Becky and Cal making out at the diner. The married Becky is unashamed of giving in to passion (\"I Didn't Plan It\"). Jenna and Dr. Pomatter continue their affair, as do Becky and Cal, and Dawn and Ogie (\"Bad Idea (Reprise)\"). Jenna wonders if their affair is a mistake, but Dr. Pomatter reassures her (\"You Matter To Me\"). She begins writing a mental note to her baby.\n\nSeveral months pass and Dawn and Ogie marry (\"I Love You Like a Table\"). At the reception, Jenna asks if Cal, despite his affair, is truly happy; he responds that he is \"happy enough.\" Joe tells Jenna his sincere hopes for her (\"Take it From an Old Man\"). Earl drags Jenna home and uncovers the money she has been hiding. She meekly tells him she has been saving for the baby, but Earl leaves with the money (\"Dear Baby\"). Jenna breaks down, lamenting her long-lost control over her life (\"[[She Used to Be Mine (Sara Bareilles song)|She Used To Be Mine]]\").\n\nJenna goes into labor (\"Contraction Ballet\"). She sees Joe at the hospital on his way to surgery; knowing he is dying, he gives her an envelope to open later. Earl, Becky and Dawn, and even Dr. Pomatter's wife, who is a resident at the hospital, crowd the delivery room, and Jenna cries out in distress, giving birth in darkness. She names her daughter Lulu. Earl reminds her of her promise not to love Lulu more than him, and Jenna finally tells him she wants a divorce. He reacts poorly, and she vows to run him over if she ever sees him again. Dr. Pomatter visits Jenna alone in her room, but Jenna refuses his kiss. Saying she doesn't want to remain \"happy enough\", she ends the affair. As thanks for his positive impact on her life, she gives him a [[moon pie]]. Jenna remarks on her change in outlook with Lulu in her life (\"Everything Changes\").\n\nJenna opens Joe's note to discover he has left her the diner, asking her to name a pie after him. A few years later, the diner has been rechristened \"Lulu's Pies\" and Jenna, the owner and head chef, is content that her life has finally turned around (\"Opening Up (Finale)\").\n\n==Music==\n''Waitress'' features an original score, with music and lyrics by American singer-songwriter [[Sara Bareilles]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/theater-art/2015/08/20/jessie-mueller-stands-out-waitress-art/2Vw1I7qtnSKp7dQz4y5FrL/story.html | title=Jessie Mueller stands out in 'Waitress' at ART | publisher=[[Boston Globe]] | work=bostonglobe.com | date=20 August 2015 | accessdate=4 April 2016}}</ref> Nadia DiGiallonardo orchestrated the show and conducted the original Broadway orchestra.

She begins another day at the diner with her boss Cal and waitresses Becky and Dawn (\"Opening Up\"). After she almost throws up, Becky and Dawn convince her to take a [[Pregnancy test | pregnancy test]] which, to Jenna's dismay, comes back positive due to a drunken night with her abusive husband, Earl (\"The Negative\"). Earl comes to the diner and suggests he may make Jenna quit and give up her passion for baking. He takes the tips she's earned from working so far that day. She decides not to tell him about the pregnancy and recalls her late mother, who also found solace from an unhappy marriage in baking (\"What Baking Can Do\").\n\nAt her [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|OB/GYN's]] office, Jenna is taunted by other pregnant women (\"Club Knocked Up\") and meets Dr. Jim Pomatter, a new doctor from Connecticut. Jenna explains she does not want her baby but is going to keep it, and leaves Dr. Pomatter with a Mermaid Marshmallow pie, which, despite the fact that he is off sugar, he eats and loves it (\"Pomatter Pie\").\n\nWord of Jenna's pregnancy reaches Joe, the diner's curmudgeonly owner, who suggests she enter a local pie-baking contest with a large reward which would allow her to leave her husband. Dawn has turned to [[Online dating service|online dating]] but is terrified of what could happen (\"When He Sees Me\").\n\nJenna runs into Dr. Pomatter at the bus stop. He compliments her pie, saying it could \"win contests and ribbons and things\". (\"It Only Takes a Taste\"). Jenna arrives home to learn Earl has been fired. He berates her, and his anger almost turns physical until she confesses she is pregnant. He makes her promise not to love the baby more than him (\"You Will Still Be Mine\"). Jenna tells Dawn and Becky her plan to enter the pie contest and use the winnings to leave Earl for a new life with the baby. The three waitresses see their dreams of a better life within reach (\"A Soft Place to Land\"). Jenna begins to give Earl only half her earnings, hiding the other half around the house in order to save up for entering the pie contest.\n\nDawn's date Ogie visits the diner and insists he get to know Dawn better (\"Never Ever Getting Rid of Me\"). Dawn and Ogie realize they both enjoy [[American Revolution]] [[Historical reenactment|reenactments]] and how much they have in common. Jenna makes an appointment with Dr. Pomatter, where she impulsively kisses him. Though both are married, they decide to escape their frustrating lives, and have sex in his office (\"Bad Idea\").\n\n=== Act II ===\nAfter her tryst, Jenna discovers Becky and Cal making out at the diner. The married Becky is unashamed of giving in to passion (\"I Didn't Plan It\"). Jenna and Dr. Pomatter continue their affair, as do Becky and Cal, and Dawn and Ogie (\"Bad Idea (Reprise)\"). Jenna wonders if their affair is a mistake, but Dr. Pomatter reassures her (\"You Matter To Me\"). She begins writing a mental note to her baby.\n\nSeveral months pass and Dawn and Ogie marry (\"I Love You Like a Table\"). At the reception, Jenna asks if Cal, despite his affair, is truly happy; he responds that he is \"happy enough.\" Joe tells Jenna his sincere hopes for her (\"Take it From an Old Man\"). Earl drags Jenna home and uncovers the money she has been hiding. She meekly tells him she has been saving for the baby, but Earl leaves with the money (\"Dear Baby\"). Jenna breaks down, lamenting her long-lost control over her life (\"[[She Used to Be Mine (Sara Bareilles song)|She Used To Be Mine]]\").\n\nJenna goes into labor (\"Contraction Ballet\"). She sees Joe at the hospital on his way to surgery; knowing he is dying, he gives her an envelope to open later. Earl, Becky and Dawn, and even Dr. Pomatter's wife, who is a resident at the hospital, crowd the delivery room, and Jenna cries out in distress, giving birth in darkness. She names her daughter Lulu. Earl reminds her of her promise not to love Lulu more than him, and Jenna finally tells him she wants a divorce. He reacts poorly, and she vows to run him over if she ever sees him again. Dr. Pomatter visits Jenna alone in her room, but Jenna refuses his kiss. Saying she doesn't want to remain \"happy enough\", she ends the affair. As thanks for his positive impact on her life, she gives him a [[moon pie]]. Jenna remarks on her change in outlook with Lulu in her life (\"Everything Changes\").\n\nJenna opens Joe's note to discover he has left her the diner, asking her to name a pie after him. A few years later, the diner has been rechristened \"Lulu's Pies\" and Jenna, the owner and head chef, is content that her life has finally turned around (\"Opening Up (Finale)\").\n\n==Music==\n''Waitress'' features an original score, with music and lyrics by American singer-songwriter [[Sara Bareilles]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/theater-art/2015/08/20/jessie-mueller-stands-out-waitress-art/2Vw1I7qtnSKp7dQz4y5FrL/story.html | title=Jessie Mueller stands out in 'Waitress' at ART | publisher=[[Boston Globe]] | work=bostonglobe.com | date=20 August 2015 | accessdate=4 April 2016}}</ref> Nadia DiGiallonardo orchestrated the show and conducted the original Broadway orchestra.

{"title_page": "List of Telugu songs recorded by K. S. Chithra", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{refimprove|date=February 2020}}\n\n==First Chance & Early Days==\nChithra was introduced to Telugu music through the musical Tamil-Telugu dubbed film ''Sindhu Bhairavi'' in 1985 composed by [[Ilaiyaraaja]]. Later on, she recorded her first song in the film \"Pralayam\" composed by [[K. V. Mahadevan]], where she sang a humming portion in [[K. J. Yesudas]]'s song. Then in 1986 she recorded two songs for the film ''Vijrumbhana'' (Composed by music director Sathyam). Her first direct Telugu song with Ilaiyaraaja was from the film [[Akhari Poratam]], which is a duet with the legendary [[S. P. Balasubrahmanyam|SPB]]. Later she recorded a song to Sathyam for the film \"Sravana Meghalu\",  song was a duet with the legendary [[P. Susheela]]. It was not that easy for any singer to make a mark at that mere time with the complete dominance of [[S.Janaki]] & [[P. Susheela]], but Chithra was a sensation & was under everyone's notice making a clear mark with her peculiar & unique voice which is absolutely distinct & clear with a perfect melodious tone suiting the context of every song's situation. It was that quality of her which made her stand out from any other female singers & make her own path. It was believed that Chithra had a slight Malayalam ting while singing Telugu & her sustain was a dubiety, but she took it as a challenge & learnt reading & writing Telugu with perfect diction. This dedication of her made a successful singer.\n\n====1980s====\nThen she went on recording songs in Telugu from 1986-1988 to Ilayaraja, Chakravarthy, K. V. Mahadevan & Sathyam, but she had her breakthrough in 1988 through the songs in the films Gharshana (Agni Natchathiram) and Geetanjali, which were commercially successful in the Telugu musical field. Her songs in Geetanjali, \"O Priya Priya\" & \"Jallantha Kavvinta\" were rage chartbusters & are remembered even till date. Ilaiyaraaja who generally prefers fresh voices chose Chithra as his regular singer & gave her many chances. Chithra sang in almost every film of Ilaiyaraaja then, for a record it was for the first time in Telugu Industry at 1980's that someother playback singer like Chithra sang all the songs in one film other then Janaki & Susheela. Her expressive renditions & distinct melodious tone became a major plus for film's success & brought her many chances in upcoming films. As Ilaiyaraaja began to use her voice regularly in his films, other music directors like Mahadevan, Sathyam, Chakravarthy & Raj-Koti began to use her voice. 1988 & 1989 began to see her raise in Telugu film industry. She recorded more than 100 songs in her initail years itself which showcased her raise.\n\n====[[1990's - 2000's]]====\nWith the influx of [[M. M. Keeravani]], a new era with different music was introduced to TFI. Keeravani is considered as one of the main reasons for Chithra's raise in TFI. From his first film itself Chithra was featured in his songs with distinct & typical maturity in her voice. Her first song with Keeravani was from the film \"Manasu Mamatha' & the song is \"Madhumaasam\". Later she recorded many successful songs which were commercial hits as well as some evergreen hits.  She got her first ever \"Nandi Award\" for playback singing for the song \"Kaliki Chilaka\" from the film \"Seetharamayya Gari Manavaraalu\" which was also under his composition. She went on to become a regular singer for M. M. Keeravani, Raj-Koti and S. V. Krishna Reddy and recorded all the songs in one film. Mostly all her life-time hits in Telugu are composed by M. M. Keeravani. She was a sensation in Telugu musical industry and had the fame of recording all the songs in one film from 1990-1995 along with S.P.Balasubrahmanyam & Mano. North Indian Music directors like Bappi Lahari & Laxmikanth Pyarelal made sure that when they composed songs for Telugu films their choice of female singer was none other then Chithra.

Later on, she recorded her first song in the film \"Pralayam\" composed by [[K. V. Mahadevan]], where she sang a humming portion in [[K. J. Yesudas]]'s song. Then in 1986 she recorded two songs for the film ''Vijrumbhana'' (Composed by music director Sathyam). Her first direct Telugu song with Ilaiyaraaja was from the film [[Akhari Poratam]], which is a duet with the legendary [[S. P. Balasubrahmanyam|SPB]]. Later she recorded a song to Sathyam for the film \"Sravana Meghalu\",  song was a duet with the legendary [[P. Susheela]]. It was not that easy for any singer to make a mark at that mere time with the complete dominance of [[S.Janaki]] & [[P. Susheela]], but Chithra was a sensation & was under everyone's notice making a clear mark with her peculiar & unique voice which is absolutely distinct & clear with a perfect melodious tone suiting the context of every song's situation. It was that quality of her which made her stand out from any other female singers & make her own path. It was believed that Chithra had a slight Malayalam ting while singing Telugu & her sustain was a dubiety, but she took it as a challenge & learnt reading & writing Telugu with perfect diction. This dedication of her made a successful singer.\n\n====1980s====\nThen she went on recording songs in Telugu from 1986-1988 to Ilayaraja, Chakravarthy, K. V. Mahadevan & Sathyam, but she had her breakthrough in 1988 through the songs in the films Gharshana (Agni Natchathiram) and Geetanjali, which were commercially successful in the Telugu musical field. Her songs in Geetanjali, \"O Priya Priya\" & \"Jallantha Kavvinta\" were rage chartbusters & are remembered even till date. Ilaiyaraaja who generally prefers fresh voices chose Chithra as his regular singer & gave her many chances. Chithra sang in almost every film of Ilaiyaraaja then, for a record it was for the first time in Telugu Industry at 1980's that someother playback singer like Chithra sang all the songs in one film other then Janaki & Susheela. Her expressive renditions & distinct melodious tone became a major plus for film's success & brought her many chances in upcoming films. As Ilaiyaraaja began to use her voice regularly in his films, other music directors like Mahadevan, Sathyam, Chakravarthy & Raj-Koti began to use her voice. 1988 & 1989 began to see her raise in Telugu film industry. She recorded more than 100 songs in her initail years itself which showcased her raise.\n\n====[[1990's - 2000's]]====\nWith the influx of [[M. M. Keeravani]], a new era with different music was introduced to TFI. Keeravani is considered as one of the main reasons for Chithra's raise in TFI. From his first film itself Chithra was featured in his songs with distinct & typical maturity in her voice. Her first song with Keeravani was from the film \"Manasu Mamatha' & the song is \"Madhumaasam\". Later she recorded many successful songs which were commercial hits as well as some evergreen hits.  She got her first ever \"Nandi Award\" for playback singing for the song \"Kaliki Chilaka\" from the film \"Seetharamayya Gari Manavaraalu\" which was also under his composition. She went on to become a regular singer for M. M. Keeravani, Raj-Koti and S. V. Krishna Reddy and recorded all the songs in one film. Mostly all her life-time hits in Telugu are composed by M. M. Keeravani. She was a sensation in Telugu musical industry and had the fame of recording all the songs in one film from 1990-1995 along with S.P.Balasubrahmanyam & Mano. North Indian Music directors like Bappi Lahari & Laxmikanth Pyarelal made sure that when they composed songs for Telugu films their choice of female singer was none other then Chithra. Vidyasagar, Hamsalekha, A.R.Rahman, S.A.Rajkumar, Manishrama, Madhavpeddi Suresh, Sri Komineni, Vandemataram Srinivas & many other music directors of 1990's chose Chithra has their first choice for recording female songs. \nFrom late 80's till 90's she has recorded so many hit female duets with P. Susheela, Vani Jayaram, S. P. Sailaja and Jikki in many films. Chitra is known for giving soul to lyrics in Telugu states. Although she belongs to Kerala, she is highly encouraged in Telugu states for her expressive renditions. She has sung a song \"Venuvai Vachanu\" from the film Matrudevobhava under M. M. Keeravani's composition (This song made her win third Nandi Award), which has turned into her life-time hit song where she sang with high expression and emotion. In spite of S.P.Sailaja, Sujatha, Swarnalatha taking over the songs in late late 90's Chithra never saw a downfall, she had her own path & distinct way of success. She has won Nandi Awards for most number of times, out of which many songs were composed by Keravani. She had a record of winning nandi awards for successful times, i.e. she won it in a row for 4 times from 1990\u20131993.\n\n====[[2000's - Present]]====\nOne more song \"Kallaloki Kallu Petti\" composed by Koti from the film Nuvve Kavali was a huge chartbuster. It is known that, while recording this song Chitra really ended up crying, she has sung the song with huge emotion giving apt soul to the song.Any music director in 20's wished to record songs in her voice. She has become a legend by then & recorded maximum Telugu songs. Introduction of many singers didn't affect her path of raising into success.\nHer association with [[Devi Sri Prasad]] & [[Manisharma]] proved extremely successful resulting in many evergreen songs. Her song with DSp for the film Varsham, fetched her ninth Nandi Award & first filmfare award too. Later 20's gave her enumerous songs with an irreplaceable position in the film industry. Later, from 2010's Chithra minimized her chances and chose to be selective in recording songs with influx of many new singers & [[shreya Ghoshal]] taking the lead, yet her journey was glorious with many evergreen & legendary compositions coming her way. Chithra attained a 'Legendary status' by 2010's & has become an evergreen singer whose voice is compared to the legends & is usually told unmatchable by any other female singers to reproduce. Music directors like Devi Sri Prasad, S.S.Thaman, Mickey j Meyer, sai kartheek consider her as a legend & wish to record her voice in any special occasion & gave her many evergreen melodies. Her chartbuster song \"Seethamma Vaakitlo\" composed by Mickey J Meyer, fetched her 2nd filmfare award & yet one more evrgreen melody \"gopikamma\" from [[Mukunda]] fetched her 11nth Nandi award which made her stand beside the legend S.Janaki in winning maximum number of Nandi Awards in TFI. Her melodious hit song \"Ee Premaki\" composed by DSP made her grab her 3rd filmfare award, thus making her hold the record of winning maximum filmfare awards Telugu for female playback singing. Chithra yet continues to enthrall Telugu audience with her melodious voice now & then.\n\nShe has sung many evergreen songs in Telugu like \"Ninnu Kori\" from Gharshana,\"Maa Perati Jaamchettu\" from Pelli Sandadi, \"Asalem Gurtukuradu\" from Antahpuram, \"Kannaule\" from Bombay, \"Ennalaku Gurtochana\" from Varsham, \"Sitamma Vakitlo\" from Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu, \"Gopikamma\" from Mukunda and many other songs. As of now Chithra has won record number of times i.e.11 Nandi Awards, 10 for film songs & 1 for non-film song. She even has a record of winning maximum Filmfare awards for female playback singing in Telugu (She has won it 3 times).<ref>[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/malayalam/music/k-s-chithra-celebrates-40-years-of-her-musical-journey/articleshow/69097073.cms]</ref>\n\nThis is a list of Telugu songs recorded by the Indian musician '''[[K.
