{"title_page": "Permanent fund", "text_new": "{{Context|date=October 2009}}\n\nIn the United States, a '''permanent fund''' is one of the five [[Fund Accounting|governmental fund]] types established by [[U.S. generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]]. It is classified as a restricted true endowment fund for governments and non-profit organizations. Put simply, a permanent fund may be used to generate and disburse money to those entitled to receive payments by qualification or agreement, as in the case of Alaska citizens or residents that satisfy the rules for payment from their permanent fund from State oil revenues. It was first introduced through [[List of GASB Statements|GASB Statement 34]]. The name of the fund comes from the purpose of the fund: a sum of equity used to permanently generate payments to maintain some financial obligation. Also, a fund can only be classified as a permanent fund if the money is used to report the status of a restricted financial resource. The resource is restricted in the sense that '''only earnings from the resource are used and not the principal'''. For example, a fund can be classified as a permanent fund if it is being used to pay for accounting services for a perpetual endowment of a government-run cemetery or [[financial endowment]]s towards a government-run library.\n\nA common misconception is that permanent funds are required for special-purpose government entities that solely engage in business-type activities. However, this is not the case. According to Statement 34, that special-purpose government entity needs only to report the net balance of the restricted resources.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[The Petroleum Fund of Norway]]\n* [[Permanent School Fund]] - funds K\u201312 schools in [[Texas]], mostly from oil and natural gas revenue.\n* [[Permanent University Fund]] - funds universities in Texas, mostly from oil and gas revenue.\n* The [[Alaska Permanent Fund]] provides annual dividends to residents of the State of [[Alaska]]\n*[[Public company]]\n*[[Crony capitalism]]\n*[[Government Accountability Office investigations of the Department of Defense]]\n*[[Federal Accountability Act]] (Canada)\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070328212235/http://www.gao.gov/about/history/gaohistory_1945-1954.html GAO History Government Accounting Office]\n*[http://www.mtas.utk.edu/KnowledgeBase.nsf/bfbd8572d38db861852569ca006e7708/5e3a69ad0ad90af7852571e0006570e4/$FILE/Capital%20Asset%20Acct%20System%20bw.pdf.

During the [[Tang dynasty]], [[Buddhism]] from [[Buddhism in Nepal|Nepal]] also became a prominent philosophical and religious discipline.

Similar to Japan, in [[Korean philosophy]] elements of [[Korean Shamanism|Shamanism]] were integrated into the [[Korean Confucianism|Neo-Confucianism]] imported from China. In Vietnam, neo-Confucianism was developed into Vietnamese own Tam gi\u00e1o as well, along with indigenous Vietnamese beliefs and [[Mahayana Buddhism]].\n\n==== Other religions ====\nThough not commonly identified with that of East Asia, the following religions have been influential in its history:\n\n# [[Hinduism]], see [[Hinduism in Vietnam]], [[Hinduism in China]]\n# Islam, see Xinjiang, [[Islam in China|Muslims in China]], [[Islam in Hong Kong]], [[Islam in Japan]], [[Islam in Korea]], [[Islam in Vietnam]].\n# Christianity, one of the most popular religions in Hong Kong, Korea etc.\n\n=== Language ===\n\n==== Historical linguistics ====\nVarious languages are thought to have originated in East Asia and have various degrees of influence on each other.

Historically, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam have used Chinese characters. Today, they are mainly used in China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea.\n\nMainland China and Singapore use [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified characters]], whereas Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau use [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional]].\n\nJapan uses [[kanji]] but has also invented [[kana]], believed to be inspired by the abugida scripts of southern Asia.\n\nKorea writes in [[hanja]] but has also invented an alphabetic system called [[hangul]], which were inspired by Chinese and [[\u02bcPhags-pa script|phags-pa]] during the Mongol Empire that is nowadays the majority script. However hanja is a required subject in South Korea. Names are also written in hanja. Hanja is also studied and used in academia, newspapers, and law; areas where a lot of scholarly terms and [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean loanwords]] are used and necessary to distinguish between otherwise ambiguous homonyms.\n[[File:FlowRoot3824.svg|thumb|388.991x388.991px|Development of kana from Chinese characters]]\n[[File:Map-Chinese Characters.png|thumb|Country where Han character is/was used]]\nVietnam used to write in [[History of writing in Vietnam|ch\u1eef H\u00e1n]] or [[Classical Chinese]]. Since the 8th century they began inventing many of their own [[ch\u1eef N\u00f4m]]. Since French colonization, they have switched to using a modified version of the Latin alphabet called [[Vietnamese alphabet|ch\u1eef Qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef]]. However, Chinese characters still hold a special place in the cultures as their history and literature have been greatly influenced by Chinese characters. In Vietnam (and North Korea), hanzi can be seen in temples, cemeteries, and monuments today, as well as serving as decorative motifs in art and design. And there are movements to restore H\u00e1n N\u00f4m in Vietnam. (Also see [[History of writing in Vietnam]].)\n\nZhuang are similar to the Vietnamese in that they used to write in Sawgun (Chinese characters) and have invented many of their own characters called [[Sawndip]] (Immature characters or native characters). Sawndip is still used informally and in traditional settings, but in 1957, the People's Republic of China introduced an alphabetical script for the language, which is what it officially promotes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Multilingualism in China : the politics of writing reforms for minority languages, 1949-2002|last=Zhou, Minglang, 1954-|date=24 October 2012|isbn=9783110924596|location=Berlin|oclc=868954061}}</ref>\n\n=== Literature ===\n{{Main|Adoption of Chinese literary culture}}\n\nEast Asian literary culture was based on the use of [[Literary Chinese]], which became the medium of scholarship and government across the region.

Although Vietnam, Korea and Japan each developed writing systems for their own languages, these were limited to popular literature. Chinese remained the medium of formal writing until it was displaced by vernacular writing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|pp=66\u201367}} Though they did not use Chinese for spoken communication, each country had its own tradition of reading texts aloud, the so-called [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations]], which provide clues to the pronunciation of [[Middle Chinese]]. Chinese words with these pronunciations were also borrowed extensively into the local vernaculars, and today comprise over half their vocabularies.{{sfnp|Miyake|2004|pp=98\u201399}}\n\nBooks in Literary Chinese were widely distributed. By the 7th century and possibly earlier, [[woodblock printing]] had been developed in China. At first, it was used only to copy the Buddhist scriptures, but later secular works were also printed. By the 13th century, metal [[movable type]] was used by government printers in Korea, but seems to have not been extensively used in China, Vietnam, or Japan. At the same time manuscript reproduction remained important until the late 19th century.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|p=68}}\n\n==== Mythology ====\n[[East Asian dragon]], pandas, [[Chinese zodiac]], etc.\n\n==== Textual Scholarship ====\nJapan's textual scholarship had Chinese origin which made Japan one of the birthplaces of [[Sinology]].<ref>\"Given Japan\u2019s strong tradition of Chinese textual scholarship, encouraged further by visits by eminent Chinese scholars since the early twentieth century, Japan has been one of the birthplaces of modern sinology outside China\"\n\nEarly China - A Social and Cultural History, page 11.

Reischauer]] also grouped China, Korea, and Japan together into a cultural sphere that he called the ''Sinic world''. These countries are centralized states that share a Confucian ethical philosophy. Reischauer states that this culture originated in Northern China, and compared the relationship between Northern China and East Asia to that of Greco-Roman civilization and Europe. The elites of East Asia were tied together through a common written language based on Chinese characters, much in the way that [[Latin]] had functioned in Europe.<ref name=\"Reischauer\" />\n\nThe American political scientist [[Samuel P. Huntington]] considered the Sinic world as one of many civilizations in his book ''[[The Clash of Civilizations]]''. He notes that \"all scholars recognize the existence of either a single distinct Chinese civilization dating back to at least 1500 B.C. and perhaps a thousand years earlier, or of two Chinese civilizations one succeeding the other in the early centuries of the Christian epoch.\"<ref>''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order.''

He conceived of a Chinese or East Asian cultural sphere distinct from cultures of the west. According to Nishijima, this cultural sphere shared the philosophy of Confucianism, the religion of Buddhism, and similar political and social structures.

Historically, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam have used Chinese characters. Today, they are mainly used in China, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore albeit in different forms.\n\nMainland China and Singapore use [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified characters]], whereas Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau use [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional]].\n\nJapan still uses [[kanji]] but has also invented [[kana]], believed to be inspired by the abugida scripts of southern Asia.\n\nKorea used to write in [[hanja]] but has invented an alphabetic system called [[hangul]] (also inspired by Chinese and [[\u02bcPhags-pa script|phags-pa]] during the Mongol Empire) that is nowadays the majority script. However hanja is a required subject in South Korea. Names are also written in hanja. Hanja is also studied and used in academia, newspapers, and law; areas where a lot of scholarly terms and [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean loanwords]] are used and necessary to distinguish between otherwise ambiguous homonyms.\n[[File:FlowRoot3824.svg|thumb|388.991x388.991px|Development of kana from Chinese characters]]\n[[File:Map-Chinese Characters.png|thumb|Country where Han character is/was used]]\nVietnam used to write in [[History of writing in Vietnam|ch\u1eef H\u00e1n]] or [[Classical Chinese]]. Since the 8th century they began inventing many of their own [[ch\u1eef N\u00f4m]]. Since French colonization, they have switched to using a modified version of the Latin alphabet called [[Vietnamese alphabet|ch\u1eef Qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef]]. However, Chinese characters still hold a special place in the cultures as their history and literature have been greatly influenced by Chinese characters. In Vietnam (and North Korea), hanzi can be seen in temples, cemeteries, and monuments today, as well as serving as decorative motifs in art and design. And there are movements to restore H\u00e1n N\u00f4m in Vietnam. (Also see [[History of writing in Vietnam]].)\n\nZhuang are similar to the Vietnamese in that they used to write in Sawgun (Chinese characters) and have invented many of their own characters called [[Sawndip]] (Immature characters or native characters). Sawndip is still used informally and in traditional settings, but in 1957, the People's Republic of China introduced an alphabetical script for the language, which is what it officially promotes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Multilingualism in China : the politics of writing reforms for minority languages, 1949-2002|last=Zhou, Minglang, 1954-|date=24 October 2012|isbn=9783110924596|location=Berlin|oclc=868954061}}</ref>\n\n=== Literature ===\n{{Main|Adoption of Chinese literary culture}}\n\nEast Asian literary culture was based on the use of [[Literary Chinese]], which became the medium of scholarship and government across the region. Although each of these countries developed vernacular writing systems and used them for popular literature, they continued to use Chinese for all formal writing until it was swept away by rising nationalism around the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Kornicki\">{{citation|last=Kornicki|first=P.F.|title=New Word Order: Transnational Themes in Book History|pages=65\u201379|year=2011|postscript=.|editor1-last=Chakravorty|editor1-first=Swapan|chapter=A transnational approach to East Asian book history|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bjJBrKfCKIYC&pg=PA65|publisher=Worldview Publications|isbn=978-81-920651-1-3|authorlink=Peter Kornicki|editor2-last=Gupta|editor2-first=Abhijit}}{{Harvnb|Kornicki|2011|pp=75\u201377}}</ref>\n\nThroughout East Asia, Literary Chinese was the language of administration and scholarship. Although Vietnam, Korea and Japan each developed writing systems for their own languages, these were limited to popular literature. Chinese remained the medium of formal writing until it was displaced by vernacular writing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|pp=66\u201367}} Though they did not use Chinese for spoken communication, each country had its own tradition of reading texts aloud, the so-called [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations]], which provide clues to the pronunciation of [[Middle Chinese]]. Chinese words with these pronunciations were also borrowed extensively into the local vernaculars, and today comprise over half their vocabularies.{{sfnp|Miyake|2004|pp=98\u201399}}\n\nBooks in Literary Chinese were widely distributed. By the 7th century and possibly earlier, [[woodblock printing]] had been developed in China. At first, it was used only to copy the Buddhist scriptures, but later secular works were also printed. By the 13th century, metal [[movable type]] was used by government printers in Korea, but seems to have not been extensively used in China, Vietnam, or Japan. At the same time manuscript reproduction remained important until the late 19th century.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|p=68}}\n\n==== Mythology ====\n[[East Asian dragon]], pandas, [[Chinese zodiac]], etc.\n\n==== Textual Scholarship ====\nJapan's textual scholarship had Chinese origin which made Japan one of the birthplaces of [[Sinology]].<ref>\"Given Japan\u2019s strong tradition of Chinese textual scholarship, encouraged further by visits by eminent Chinese scholars since the early twentieth century, Japan has been one of the birthplaces of modern sinology outside China\"\n\nEarly China - A Social and Cultural History, page 11.
