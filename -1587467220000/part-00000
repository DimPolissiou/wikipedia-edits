Diagenetic [[Siderite]] intercalations and concretions, ~20 cm thick, as well as [[Pyrite]] concretions are also present.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The mineralization \nof siderite occurs in all types of Ciechocinek Formation deposits. Include fine crystalline variety, coarse crystalline rhombohedra and fine crystalline aggregates impregnated by a mixture of undetermined Fehydroxides.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> The mineralization of the siderites on certain layers is associated to the abundance of organic matter, with the decay of it ending on a progressive carbonate supersaturation, with an early precipitation on the nucleus of the siderites. They reflect also the conditions of salinity on the water, showing alternances in short periods, associated with the abundance of organic matter.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> Muds and mudstones consist mainly of particles with the size of common clay, some with an admixture of silt; sandy muds and mudstones are also encountered in counterpart to the pure clays and claystones, without admixtures of other fractions, that are rare or extremely rare. Mudstones are poorly consolidated, tren to disintegration, swell and become plastic, being the only exceptional ones those the heavy sideritic mudstones, that range from a wide variety of colors, from  brown or cherry-red in colour, with an olive shade often appearing.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> On the other hand, there are abundant poorly consolidated [[Quartz]] sandstones, that are regularly intercalated with [[Silt]] and [[Siltstone]].<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Along the Sandstones, there are [[Chlorite]] and [[Kaolinite]] grains. Plant microremains are common, concentrated with mica flakes on lamination planes, while larger wood fragments, several cm long, are also moderately frequent.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Heavy minerals are present and include as the most common [[Euhedral]] forms such as [[Zircon]], [[Rutile]] and [[Tourmaline]], along with angular fragments of [[Rutile]], [[Garnet]] and [[Staurolite]], with finally well-rounded oval grains of Zircon, Rutile, Garnet and Tourmaline. Outside the main heavy minerals, it is possible to find well-rounded grains of green [[Hornblende]], [[Apatite]], [[Disthene]], [[Epidote]], and finally on one study one [[Pyroxene]] grain was found.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The presence of [[Kaolinite]], related to continental formation in tropical climate environments for the chemical weathering of different igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, along with [[Chlorite]] & [[Biotite]], suggest a deposition linked to fluvial & deltaic forces. The eastern Sudetes and their foreland are the best candidates to be the origin of the transported material, as they have a nearly identical composition, being the Lower Jurassic deposits in the [[Fore-Sudetic Monocline]] linked [[Cracow-Cz\u00eastochowa Monocline]], with the strata of the Formation.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\n[[File:Wapienno - kamienio\u0142omy Cementowni Kujawy - Lafarge Cement 2009.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[Wapienno]] Cement Quarry, with exposed strata of the Formation]]\nDeposits of the Ciechocinek Formation are related to a brackish-marine origin, being deposited in an epicontinental sedimentary basin on Poland, that was the eastern arm of the Mid-European [[Toarcian]] Basin.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Sedimentological analyses pointed to a deposition in a shallow basin, prevalently at <20 m deep, with present features of a large shallow embayment, influenced by deltaic facies, that has it\u00b4s origin on marginal parts.

It is believed that the dominant sedimentation was by quiet [[mud]] and silt sedimentation from suspension, which probably come from near [[River Mouths]].  It was a sedimentary basin with a continuous influx of [[Clay]] and fine [[Silt]], to which sand was brought by events such as river transportation, storms, eustatic effects, and other related.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\">Leonowicz, P.

The presence of alluvial sedimentation still on the nearshore environments, as an effect probably related to floods.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On some layers it was observed that the chemistry of the sea water was changing as the deposition continues on the most recent layers of the Ciechocinek Formation, implying the possible formation of a brackish environment, probably due to the sedimentation of fluvial currents.

Plant matter & Fish Teeth have been found here.]]\nThe Ciechocinek is composed mostly by muds and silts, along with poorly consolidated [[Mudstone]]s and [[Siltstone]]s with lenses and subordinate intercalations of fine-grained sandy lenses, typically from 1 mm to less 20 cm thick, extended a few meters, along also with sandstones. Diagenetic [[Siderite]] intercalations and concretions, ~20 cm thick, as well as [[Pyrite]] concretions are also present.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The mineralization \nof siderite occurs in all types of Ciechocinek Formation deposits. Include fine crystalline variety, coarse crystalline rhombohedra and fine crystalline aggregates impregnated by a mixture of undetermined Fehydroxides.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> The mineralization of the siderites on certain layers is associated to the abundance of organic matter, with the decay of it ending on a progressive carbonate supersaturation, with an early precipitation on the nucleus of the siderites. They reflect also the conditions of salinity on the water, showing alternances in short periods, associated with the abundance of organic matter.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> Muds and mudstones consist mainly of particles with the size of common clay, some with an admixture of silt; sandy muds and mudstones are also encountered in counterpart to the pure clays and claystones, without admixtures of other fractions, that are rare or extremely rare. Mudstones are poorly consolidated, tren to disintegration, swell and become plastic, being the only exceptional ones those the heavy sideritic mudstones, that range from a wide variety of colors, from  brown or cherry-red in colour, with an olive shade often appearing.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> On the other hand, there are abundant poorly consolidated [[Quartz]] sandstones, that are regularly intercalated with [[Silt]] and [[Siltstone]].<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Along the Sandstones, there are [[Chlorite]] and [[Kaolinite]] grains. Plant microremains are common, concentrated with mica flakes on lamination planes, while larger wood fragments, several cm long, are also moderately frequent.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Heavy minerals are present and include as the most common [[Euhedral]] forms such as [[Zircon]], [[Rutile]] and [[Tourmaline]], along with angular fragments of [[Rutile]], [[Garnet]] and [[Staurolite]], with finally well-rounded oval grains of Zircon, Rutile, Garnet and Tourmaline. Outside the main heavy minerals, it is possible to find well-rounded grains of green [[Hornblende]], [[Apatite]], [[Disthene]], [[Epidote]], and finally on one study one [[Pyroxene]] grain was found.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The presence of [[Kaolinite]], related to continental formation in tropical climate environments for the chemical weathering of different igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, along with [[Chlorite]] & [[Biotite]], suggest a deposition linked to fluvial & deltaic forces. The eastern Sudetes and their foreland are the best candidates to be the origin of the transported material, as they have a nearly identical composition, being the Lower Jurassic deposits in the [[Fore-Sudetic Monocline]] linked [[Cracow-Cz\u00eastochowa Monocline]], with the strata of the Formation.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\n[[File:Wapienno - kamienio\u0142omy Cementowni Kujawy - Lafarge Cement 2009.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[Wapienno]] Cement Quarry, with exposed strata of the Formation]]\nDeposits of the Ciechocinek Formation are related to a brackish-marine origin, being deposited in an epicontinental sedimentary basin on Poland, that was the eastern arm of the Mid-European [[Toarcian]] Basin.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Sedimentological analyses pointed to a deposition in a shallow basin, prevalently at <20 m deep, with present features of a large shallow embayment, influenced by deltaic facies, that has it\u00b4s origin on marginal parts. Well preseved estructural succesions along the strata show that the depositional environment of the formation was strongly influenced by storm periods.<ref name=storms>Leonowicz, P. M. (2016). Tubular tempestites from Jurassic mudstones of southern Poland. Geological Quarterly, 60(2), 385-394.</ref> During that storm periods, paleocurrents transported sand and other components from nearshore to distal settings, being after that reworked by waves and distributed along the sea floor, by several wave related flows.<ref name=storms/> Distal settings show the influence of the storms with due to the presence of several lamintaed deposition of sand-silt streaks, cross-laminated [[Silt]], small [[Sand]] lenses and interlaid [[Mud]]-[[Silt]]-[[Sand]] [[Heterolith]]s.<ref name=storms/> Near Settings are represented on the strata by several centimetre thick layers and sand packets, with several traces and sedimentary structures, such as wave parallel and crossbed ripplemarks. Along this strata, trace fossils are deposited on settings where geochemical analises show the presence of a brackish water influence on the basin.<ref name=storms/> The main component of the deposits are muds,  intercalate sandstones & silts disposed on a high variety of structures, with at least twelve lithofacies that run from fine-grained sedimentations to wave-dominated [[sandy shoal]]s. It is believed that the dominant sedimentation was by quiet [[mud]] and silt sedimentation from suspension, which probably come from near [[River Mouths]].  It was a sedimentary basin with a continuous influx of [[Clay]] and fine [[Silt]], to which sand was brought by events such as river transportation, storms, eustatic effects, and other related.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\">Leonowicz, P.

The presence of alluvial sedimentation still on the nearshore environments, as an effect probably related to floods.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On some layers it was observed that the chemistry of the sea water was changing as the deposition continues on the most recent layers of the Ciechocinek Formation, implying the possible formation of a brackish environment, probably due to the sedimentation of fluvial currents.

They are closely related to the red<!--brown : the supporting reference uses 'red' for every species--> colobus monkeys of genus ''[[Piliocolobus]]''.<ref name=msw3/> There are five species of this monkey, and at least eight subspecies:<ref name=msw3/> They are generally found in high-density forests where they forage on leaves, flowers and fruit. Social groups of colobus are diverse, varying from group to group.<ref name=\":02\" /> Resident-egalitarian and [[allomothering]] relationships have been observed among the female population.<ref name=\":1\" /> Complex behaviours have also been observed in this species, including greeting rituals<ref name=\":03\" /> and varying group sleeping patterns.<ref name=\":3\" /> Colobi play a significant role in seed dispersal.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"colobus\" comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b2\u03cc\u03c2 ''kolob\u00f3s'' (\"docked\"), so-named because the thumb is stump-like.\n\n==Habitat and food==\nColobuses habitats include primary and secondary forests, riverine forests, and wooded grasslands; they are found more in higher-density logged forests than in other primary forests. Their [[ruminant]]-like digestive systems have enabled them to occupy niches that are inaccessible to other primates: they are [[Herbivore|herbivorous]], eating leaves, fruit, flowers, lichen and twigs.\n\nLeaf toughness influences colobus foraging efficiency.
