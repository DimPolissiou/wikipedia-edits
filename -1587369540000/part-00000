[[Telegraphy]] is the sending of textual messages by human operators using [[telegraph code|symbolic codes]].  [[Electrical telegraph]]y sends these messages over conducting wires, often incorporating a [[telegram]] service (the delivery of telegraph messages by messenger from the telegraph office).  It is distinct from the [[optical telegraphy]] that preceded it and the [[radiotelegraphy]] that followed it.  [[Francis Ronalds]] first demonstrated a working telegraph over a substantial distance in 1816, but was unable to put it into use.  Starting in 1836, [[William Fothergill Cooke]], with the scientific assistance of [[Charles Wheatstone]], developed the [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph]] and Cooke formed a company to exploit it.  Important components were the [[needle telegraph]] instrument suggested by Wheatstone, the [[Daniell cell|battery]] invented by [[John Frederic Daniell]], and the [[relay]] invented by [[Edward Davy]].\n\nIn 1846 the [[Electric Telegraph Company]] (the ''Electric'') was formed by Cooke and financier [[John Lewis Ricardo]].  The company initially supplied telegraph systems to railway companies, but soon branched out into other businesses and slowly built a network that could be used by the general public.  Many competing companies arose; the most important of them was the [[Magnetic Telegraph Company]] (the ''Magnetic'') formed in 1850.  The Magnetic used the telegraph invented by [[William Thomas Henley]] which did not require batteries.  The Electric and Magnetic companies soon formed a [[cartel]] to control the market.  Most telegraph companies were unprofitable except for the Electric and Magnetic.\n\n[[Submarine telegraph cable]]s were required to extend the telegraph beyond [[Great Britain|mainland Britain]].  Suitable insulation for these was not available until the introduction of [[gutta-percha]] in 1843 by Scottish military surgeon [[William Montgomerie]].  The [[Submarine Telegraph Company]] laid the world's first international submarine cable in 1851 when they connected England with France.  The [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] was laid by [[John Pender]]'s [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]] in 1866 after several failures.  Many more Pender companies were formed to lay various cables connecting Britain with its colonies in India and then on to the Far East and Australia.  Once the cables were laid, these disparate companies were merged into the [[Eastern Telegraph Company]], first established in 1872.  The company was absorbed into [[Cable & Wireless Ltd]] in 1934.\n\nThe inland telegraph companies were [[Nationalization|nationalised]] in 1870 and then run as part of the [[General Post Office]] (the Post Office).  Companies operating international submarine cables were left independent.  A major mistake made during nationalisation was that the estimated costs failed to take into account the cost of purchasing railway company [[wayleave]]s, or even that it would be necessary to do so.  The final bill far exceeded the original estimate.  The telegraph was never profitable under nationalisation because of government policies; prices were held low to make it affordable to as many people as possible and the telegraph was extended to every post office issuing [[money order]]s, whether or not that office generated enough telegraph business to be profitable.  Telegraph usage increased enormously under the Post Office, but it was never as cheap as the postal service and growing competition from the telephone started to reduce its market share.\n\nThe telegraph was an important resource in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] which somewhat delayed its decline.  Decline was also countered with the introduction of special greetings telegrams (birthdays etc.) in 1935 which proved highly popular.  Even so, by 1970 telegram usage had fallen to its lowest ever total under nationalisation.  Repeated price rises to control the deficit drove usage down even further.  [[Post Office Telecommunications]] was separated from the Post Office as [[British Telecom]] in 1981.  This was a first step towards its privatisation in 1984.  In 1982 British Telecom ended its inland telegram service.  International telegrams could be sent by telephone and were received by ordinary letter post.  Some private wire use of telegraph continued after the end of the telegram service, and the [[telex]] system continued in use by an ever-diminishing group of private users.  Most of these succumbed to alternatives on the [[internet]] in the 1990s.\n\n== Early development ==\n[[File:Ronalds telegraph.png|thumb|alt=sketch|Ronalds' eight miles of iron wire strung in his garden]]\nThe first demonstration that an electric telegraph could be operated over a substantial distance was conducted by [[Francis Ronalds]] in his [[Hammersmith]] garden in 1816.  Eight miles of iron wire were strung back and forth between wooden frames.  The source of power he used was high-voltage [[electrostatic generator|friction machines]].  Ronalds offered his system to the [[Admiralty]], but they were already using an [[optical telegraph]] and saw no need for Ronalds' invention, despite the optical telegraph being frequently unusable due to weather conditions.  It was never put to the test, but it is likely that Ronalds' system could not be made to work over very long distances using static electricity generators.  Even the relatively short test system only worked well in dry weather.<ref>Kieve, pp. 15\u201316</ref>\n\nNearly all the telegraph systems that were finally successful used batteries of [[electrochemical cell]]s as their source of power.  An important development that made this possible was the invention of the [[Daniell cell]] in 1836 by [[John Frederic Daniell]].  The earlier [[voltaic pile]] suffered from falling voltage if used continuously due to the formation of hydrogen bubbles around the copper electrode which tended to insulate it.  The Daniell cell solved this problem by placing the zinc and copper electrodes in separate [[electrolyte]]s with a porous barrier between them.<ref>Derry & Williams, p. 611</ref>  The hydrogen is consumed by the [[sulfuric acid]] electrolyte, [[oxidizing agent|oxidizing]] it to water, before it can reach the copper electrode in the [[copper sulphate]] electrolyte.<ref>Hewitt, p. 137</ref>  A later improvement by J. F. Fuller in 1853 replaced sulfuric acid with [[zinc sulfate]].<ref>Derry & Williams, p. 611</ref>\n\nAnother important development was the [[relay]], invented by surgeon [[Edward Davy]] in 1837 and patented in 1838.  The relay allows weak telegraph pulses to be regenerated.  The incoming pulse activates an [[electromagnet]] which moves an [[armature (electrical)|armature]] to which are attached [[electrical contacts]] which close and complete a secondary circuit.  A local battery provides the current for a new pulse through the contacts and onwards along the telegraph line.  Davy's relay was the first device to use metallic make-and-break contacts.<ref>McDonald & Hunt, p. 306</ref>  The importance of the relay lies in that it allows telegraph transmissions over long distances that would otherwise require operators at periodic intermediate stations to read and retransmit the message.<ref>Kieve, p. 24</ref>  Davy began experimenting in telegraphy in 1835, and in 1837 demonstrated his telegraph system in [[Regent's Park]] over a mile of copper wire.<ref>Kieve, p. 23</ref>  He held an exhibition in London, but after his marriage broke down he abandoned telegraphy and emigrated to Australia.<ref>McDonald & Hunt, pp. 306\u2013307</ref>\n\n[[File:Cooke William Fothergill (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=photo|William Fothergill Cooke]]\nThe person who was the driving force in establishing the telegraph as a business in the United Kingdom was [[William Fothergill Cooke]].  He was initially inspired to build a telegraph after seeing a demonstration of a [[needle telegraph]] by [[Georg Wilhelm Muncke]] in March 1836.  He built a prototype shortly afterwards, but did not pursue this design.<ref>{{multiref|Kieve, pp. 17\u201319|Shaffner, 179\u2013185}}</ref>  Instead, he looked for mechanical solutions because he believed that the needle telegraph would require multiple wires, each driving a separate needle.<ref>Shaffner, p. 187</ref>  Cooke initially made a telegraph with a clockwork [[detent]] mechanism operating electromagnets.  The first mechanical apparatus was built in 1836.<ref>Shaffner, pp. 185\u2013187</ref>  He pitched the telegraph to various railway companies as a means of signalling to control trains but without success.<ref>Bowers, pp. 123\u2013125</ref>  Cooke, who was not scientifically trained, sought advice from [[Michael Faraday]] and [[Charles Wheatstone]].  Wheatstone recommended using a needle telegraph system.<ref>Shaffner, p. 191</ref>  After the collaboration with Wheatstone began, only needle telegraphs were pursued.  The [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph]] developed by the two men and patented in May 1837 could have various arrangements of needles, but the one that initially became successful used five needles.  They were operated in pairs so that the pair of needles pointed to a letter of the alphabet marked on a board.<ref>Shaffner, pp. 191-201</ref>\n[[File:Cooke and Wheatstone electric telegraph.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=photo|Cooke and Wheatstone five-needle telegraph]]\nCooke proposed the Cooke and Wheatstone system to the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]],<ref>Hubbard, pp. 33\u201346</ref> and a four-needle system was trialled by the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] in July 1837.<ref>Hubbard, pp. 47\u201355</ref>  Both applications were for signalling with [[cable railway|rope-hauled trains]] but both railways rejected electrical telegraph signalling in favour of steam-driven whistles.<ref>Bowers, p. 129</ref>  The first success came in 1838 when a five-needle telegraph was installed by the [[Great Western Railway]] from [[Paddington station]] to [[West Drayton]].<ref>Bowers, p. 129</ref>  This was the first commercial telegraph in the world.<ref>Huurdeman, p. 67</ref>  The cables were originally laid in an underground conduit, but the insulation started to fail.<ref>{{multiref|Huurdeman, pp. 67\u201368|Beauchamp, p. 35}}</ref>  Cooke replaced the instruments with a two-needle system using only the wires that remained intact.<ref>Mercer, p. 7</ref>  The [[telegraph code|code]] for the two-needle system could not be read off a board; it had to be learned.  The profession of [[telegraphist|telegraph operator]] (telegraphist) had been created for the first time.<ref>Kieve, pp. 32\u201333</ref>\n\nIn 1843 the telegraph line was extended to [[Slough]] and Cooke converted the whole line to a one-needle system.<ref>Huurdeman, page 69</ref>  New uninsulated wires were run suspended from poles on [[Insulator (electricity)#Telegraph and power transmission insulators|ceramic insulators]], a system which Cooke patented,<ref>Kieve, p. 32</ref> and which rapidly became ubiquitous.<ref>Duffy, p. 5</ref>  This extension was done at Cooke's own expense as the railway company was unwilling to finance a system it still considered experimental.  Up to this point, the Great Western had insisted on exclusive use and refused Cooke permission to open public telegraph offices.  Cooke's new agreement gave the railway free use of the system in exchange for Cooke's right to open public offices, for the first time establishing a public telegraph service.<ref>Kieve, pages 31\u201332</ref>  A flat rate of one [[shilling]] (5[[Penny (British decimal coin)|p]]) was charged regardless of message length, but many people paid this just to see the strange equipment.<ref>Kieve, p. 33</ref>\n\nThe earliest machine for sending pictures by telegraph ([[fax]]) is due to Scottish inventor [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]] in 1848.  An earlier, but unbuilt, design was patented by Bain in 1843.<ref>Coopersmith, p. 14</ref>    Another fax machine was demonstrated at the [[Great Exhibition]] by [[Frederick C. Bakewell]] in 1851 with an improved design.<ref>Parsons, p. 13</ref>  Bain also invented a chemical [[printing telegraph]].  He used a dot-dash code with this machine that was similar to [[Morse code]], but with different [[codepoint]]s.  The Bain telegraph had some popularity in the 1850s in England, but when Bain took it to the US in 1849 he became embroiled in litigation with Morse.<ref>{{multiref|Russell, pp. 62\u201363|Morrison, pp. 36\u201337}}</ref>  The dispute broke him financially and he returned to clockmaking, his original profession, in later life.<ref>Burns (2004b)</ref>\n\n== Telegraph companies ==\n{{see also|List of historical British telcos#Telegraph companies}}\nDevelopment of the telegraph in Britain was distinctly different from other European countries.  In [[Continental Europe]], telegraph development was for government purposes and controlled as a state monopoly.  For instance, the early telegraph installations by [[Siemens]] in [[Prussia]] had a distinctly military purpose, and in France it was years before the public was allowed to use the telegraph at all.  In Britain, between 1846 and 1870, that is from the formation of the first telegraph company until [[nationalisation]], the telegraph grew entirely at the instigation of private companies with private capital and without government support.<ref>Kieve, pp. 46\u201347</ref>  Between 1846 and 1868, 64 telegraph companies were formed.  However, 68% of them failed and only a handful of them grew to any significant size.<ref>Kieve, p. 96</ref>\n\n=== Electric Telegraph Company ===\n{{main|Electric Telegraph Company}}\n[[File:PSM V03 D418 Single needle instrument.jpg|thumb|alt=drawing|Cooke and Wheatstone single-needle instrument c. 1872\u20131873]]\nThe [[Electric Telegraph Company]] (ETC) was formed in 1846 by Cooke and financier [[John Lewis Ricardo]],<ref>Haigh, p. 195</ref> and was the first company formed for the purpose of providing a telegraph service to the public.<ref>Kieve, p. 31</ref>  It was formed without Wheatstone as he and Cooke had had a serious falling out over who should take credit for the invention.  The matter went to arbitration with [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] acting for Cooke and Daniell acting for Wheatstone.  A compromise was reached with both of them taking some credit.  Wheatstone was uninterested in commercial enterprises, wishing only to publish scientific results.  The ETC bought out Wheatstone's patent interest in exchange for royalties;<ref>{{multiref|Bowler & Morus, pp. 403\u2013404|Bowers, p. 119}}</ref>  Davy's relay patent was also acquired.<ref>Kieve, p. 24</ref>  The company bought out Bain for the substantial sum of \u00a37,500 ({{Inflation|UK|7500|1846|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3|r=-4}}) because he was threatening to derail the bill forming the company on the grounds that his patents would be infringed.<ref>Burns (2004a), pp. 93\u201394</ref>  The ETC bought out other telegraph patents when they could, often not because they wanted to use them, but as a means of suppressing competition.<ref>Roberts, ch. 4</ref>\n\nThe company at first concentrated on business with the railways but struggled to be profitable.<ref>Kieve, p. 49</ref>  On the other hand, their relationship with the railways gave them a structural advantage over competitors that started up later.  By the time competitors came on the scene the ETC had agreements with most railways.  The railways gave exclusive use of the [[wayleave]]s to the ETC, shutting out competitors from the most economic way of building a telegraph network.<ref>Kieve, pp. 49, 52</ref>\n\nAfter 1848 other areas of business started to grow in comparison to the railways.<ref>Kieve, pp. 44\u201345</ref>  Supply of news to newspapers and stock exchange information to the financial sector were profitable.<ref>Kieve, p. 49</ref>  A major user from the beginning was the insurer [[Lloyd's of London]], and they had telegraph instruments installed directly in their London offices in 1852.<ref>Huurdeman, p. 106</ref>  General use by the public was slow to grow due to high prices.<ref>Kieve, p. 49</ref>  The telegram business grew after competition drove down prices and this led in 1859 to the company relocating their London [[central office (telecommunications)|central office]] to bigger premises in Great Bell Alley, [[Moorgate]], the eastern portion of which was later renamed Telegraph Street after the company.<ref>Roberts, ch. 4</ref>  The ETC remained by far the largest telegraph company until nationalisation in 1870.<ref>Hills, p. 22</ref>  Cooke retired from the company after nationalisation.  Both he and Wheatstone were knighted for their efforts in telegraphy in, respectively, 1869 and 1868.<ref>Huurdeman, p. 107</ref>\n\nThe ETC was heavily involved in laying submarine telegraph cables to Europe and Ireland.  They operated the first [[cable ship]] permanently fitted out for laying cables, [[CS Monarch (1830)|CS ''Monarch'']].  In 1853 they created the International Telegraph Company to overcome Dutch objections to a British company laying telegraph cables on their soil.  This company was merged back into the ETC in 1854, the name of the new company becoming the Electric and International Telegraph Company.<ref>Kieve, p. 52</ref>  Other subsidiary companies created to lay submarine cables were the Channel Islands Telegraph Company (1857) and the [[Isle of Man Telegraph Company]] (1859).<ref>Haigh, pp. 195\u2013196</ref>\n\n=== Magnetic Telegraph Company ===\n{{main|British and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company}}\n[[File:Foster magneto-electric telegraph.png|thumb|alt=drawing of inner workings|Henley-Foster two-needle telegraph]]\nThe English and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company (Magnetic Telegraph Company, or just Magnetic for short) was established by [[John Watkins Brett|John Brett]] in 1850,<ref>{{multiref|Huurdeman, p. 129|Hills, p. 294}}</ref> initially to connect Britain and Ireland with a submarine telegraph cable.<ref>Smith, p. 21</ref>  The first attempt at this failed as did several other attempts by rival companies.  The Magnetic finally succeeded in 1853, giving Ireland a telegraphic connection to Britain for the first time, and through Britain, on to mainland Europe.<ref>{{multiref|Smith, p. 22|Ash, p. 22}}</ref>  This was the deepest submarine cable laid to date.<ref>Bright, p. 14</ref>\n\n{{anchor|British Electric Telegraph Company}}\nThe Magnetic was the largest competitor to the ETC with the two of them forming a virtual [[duopoly]], and in this context the ETC was commonly referred to as the Electric to counterpose it to the Magnetic.<ref>Hills, p. 22</ref>  It was not, however, the first competitor.  That was the British Electric Telegraph Company (BETC), founded in 1849.<ref>Kieve, p. 50</ref>  It later changed its name to the British Telegraph Company to avoid confusion with the ETC.<ref>Roberts, ch.5</ref>  The BETC failed because they were founded on the mistaken assumption that they would be able to obtain railway wayleaves.  They wrongly believed that Parliament would force the railway companies to allow them to erect lines.  In the event, they obtained very few wayleaves; the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] was one of the few exceptions.<ref>Roberts, ch.5</ref>  They were taken over by the Magnetic in 1857 under the new name of the British and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company.<ref>Beauchamp, p. 77</ref>  The Magnetic avoided the pitfalls encountered by the BETC.  From the start, they planned their system based on underground cables along highways.<ref>{{multiref|Bright, p. 5|Beauchamp, p. 77}}</ref> Not only did the ETC have the railway wayleaves, but the [[United Kingdom Telegraph Company]] had the wayleaves for canals and the BETC had the wayleaves for overground cables along highways.<ref>Bright & Bright, pp. 74\u201375</ref>  This asset of the BETC was the attraction for the Magnetic in its takeover of them.<ref>Bright & Bright, pp. 72\u201373</ref>\n\nThe Magnetic used a telegraph system not covered by the ETC patents.<ref>Mercer, p. 8</ref>  It used the needle telegraph of [[William Thomas Henley]] and George Foster which did not require batteries.  Movement of the machine handles while the operator was sending a message generated the electricity electromagnetically.  This was the meaning of ''magnetic'' in the company name.<ref>Beauchamp, p. 77</ref>  After the BETC takeover, the Magnetic acquired the needle telegraph of its founder, [[Henry Highton]].  This instrument was the cheapest available of the manual telegraph systems at between \u00a32 10 shillings (\u00a32.50) and \u00a33.<ref>Morse, p. 117</ref>  By the time of nationalisation, the Magnetic were also using Bright's bells on their most important lines.  The latter instrument was an invention of [[Charles Tilston Bright]] which was acoustic rather than visual and allowed the operator to work faster.<ref>{{multiref|Morse, p. 116|Bright & Bright, pp. 67\u201371 }}</ref>\n\nThe Magnetic not only laid the first cable to Ireland, they also had an exclusive agreement with the [[Submarine Telegraph Company]] which controlled the cables to Europe.<ref>Bright & Bright, pp. 73\u201374</ref>  For a short period, the Magnetic had control of all international traffic, shutting out the ETC.<ref>Hills, pp. 62\u201363</ref>  In Ireland, the Magnetic acquired most of the railway wayleaves forcing the ETC to use roads and canals, the exact reverse of the situation in Great Britain.<ref>Kieve, p. 54</ref>\n\n=== London District Telegraph Company ===\n{{main|London District Telegraph Company}}\nLondon District Telegraph Company (the ''District''), formed in 1859 in London, was a company closely associated with the Magnetic.  John Watkins Brett and Charles Kemp Dyer were directors of both companies and  Edward Brailsford Bright was secretary of both.  Their telegraph operators were trained at the Magnetic's headquarters in the [[Strand, London|Strand]].<ref>Kieve, p. 56</ref>  The Magnetic installed the telegraph lines for the District and leased them back to the District for a [[peppercorn rent]] in exchange for the District passing on the Magnetic's messages to and from outside London.<ref>Kieve, p. 59</ref>  The business model of the District was to provide cheap telegrams within London and not install expensive links between cities.  Prices were [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|fourpence]] (1.7p) for ten words and [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]] (2.5p) for fifteen words.<ref>Kieve, p. 56</ref>  By comparison, a long distance telegram on the Electric cost four shillings (20p).<ref>Kieve, p. 53</ref>  The area of the District was limited to within four miles of [[Charing Cross]], with possible later expansion to twenty miles.  The District avoided the expense of erecting telegraph poles or burying cables by stringing the wires from building to building, a technique that could only be used in heavily built-up areas.<ref>Kieve, p. 56</ref>\n\nRooftop wires may have been cheap to install, but obtaining the wayleaves could be troublesome.  Thousands of individual permissions had to be sought and some unusual conditions were sometimes imposed.  One householder insisted that the installers enter her property only once (after wiping their feet) to access the roof.  Meals were hoisted up to the workmen on the roof until they had finished.<ref>Kieve, pp. 58\u201359</ref>  In all, around seven thousand interviews and negotiations were conducted, many of them equally troublesome, to erect only 280 miles of wire.<ref>Prescott, p. 359</ref>  The cheap prices of the District stimulated a much more casual use of the telegraph; in 1862 the company transmitted a quarter of a million messages.<ref>Kieve, p. 59</ref>\n\n=== United Kingdom Telegraph Company ===\nThe United Kingdom Telegraph Company (UKTC), founded by Thomas Allan, was the last major telegraph company to be formed.  It was registered in 1850, but did not raise sufficient capital to launch until 1860.<ref>Kieve, pp. 61\u201362</ref>  The business model was to provide a [[flat rate]] of one shilling (5p) for twenty words within 100 miles and two shillings (10p) beyond 100 miles, thus undercutting the established companies.<ref>Kieve, p. 62</ref>  The Electric, with the Magnetic's support, put a great deal of effort into obstructing the UKTC.  They challenged UKTC's right to use highways in Parliament, and this was not resolved until Parliament passed an Act in 1862 allowing the UKTC to erect [[trunk line]]s along highways.  The Electric used their exclusive agreements with the railways to demand that they cut down UKTC lines crossing railway property, a demand which the railway companies for the most part complied with.  The Electric also petitioned other landowners to exclude the UKTC, and in some cases UKTC lines were cut illegally.  All this activity made it extremely difficult for the UKTC to establish trunk routes between cities.  The UKTC did have one good option; they had exclusive rights along canals, but they could not reach Scotland or Ireland this way.<ref>Kieve, pp. 63\u201364</ref>\n\nThe UKTC got their first trunk line up in 1863 connecting London, [[Birmingham]], [[Manchester]], and [[Liverpool]].  In 1864, they completed a second trunk along the route London, [[Northampton]], [[Leicester]], [[Sheffield]], [[Barnsley]], [[Wakefield]], and [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]].  The northern end of this line was then linked to Manchester and Liverpool, thus connecting the two trunks together at both ends.  Later, the trunk network was extended into Scotland reaching [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]].  In 1865 the network was extended west, reaching [[Swansea]] and [[Plymouth]].  In 1866, traffic on the UKTC network was nearly three-quarters of a million messages.<ref>Kieve, p. 64</ref>\n\nThe UKTC used the [[printing telegraph]] of [[David Edward Hughes]].  This was an early form of [[teleprinter]] in which the message is directly printed without the operator needing to decode it.  Transmission was from a piano-like keyboard marked with the letters of the alphabet.  The Electric had tested the Hughes printing telegraph in 1858 but decided against using it.<ref>Kieve, p. 65</ref>  The operation of the printing telegraph was mechanical, a spinning wheel with the character [[Sort (typesetting)|types]], similar to a modern [[Daisy wheel printing|daisy wheel printer]], was pressed against the paper at the appropriate time.  The wheel in the receiving machine had to be kept in exact synchrony with the sending machine, otherwise garbage would be printed.  The Hughes machine did this by sending synchronisation pulses down the line.  This was a marked improvement on earlier machines which were slow and temperamental.<ref>Beauchamp, p. 89</ref>\n\n=== Universal Private Telegraph Company ===\n[[File:ABC machine.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=photo|An ABC telegraph instrument from the General Post Office era, dated 1885]]\nThe [[Universal Private Telegraph Company]] (UPTC) was established in 1861 for the purpose of providing private telegraph links for companies and institutions.  The telegraph system they used was the ABC telegraph, also known as Wheatstone's universal telegraph.  This was an instrument patented by Charles Wheatstone in 1858.  It was designed to be used by unskilled operators with no knowledge of telegraph codes.  Letters were marked around a dial with a button for each.  The operator pressed the desired button and then turned a handle which generated pulses of current.  The pulses moved a pointer through successive positions until it reached the button that had been pressed at which point the current was cut off.  A receiving dial indicated the position that had been reached at both ends of the circuit.  Although much slower than other telegraph systems, it was possible to reach 25 [[wpm]] with practice.<ref>Kieve, p. 64</ref>\n\nThe company proved to be highly profitable.  It charged \u00a34 per mile of wire per annum, and had few overheads.  Unlike the public companies, it did not have to staff telegraph offices or employ operators to send and receive messages.<ref>Kieve, p. 70</ref>\n\n== Profitability ==\nOf the inland public companies, only the ETC and the Magnetic were profitable.  The District, with low prices and a troublesome rooftop system to maintain suffered a loss every year of its existence except 1865.  The UKTC had come late to the party and hoped to take business away from the big two with low prices, but they were handicapped by an inability to obtain wayleaves on the best routes.<ref>Kieve, pp. 92\u201393</ref>  The resulting price war ended with them joining the ETC/Magnetic cartel and agreeing a common price structure, thus destroying their original business model.<ref>Kieve, pp. 66\u201367</ref>\n\nCompetition from the District and UKTC, together with economies of scale as the network grew, steadily drove down prices.   In 1851 the ETC charged ten [[shilling]]s (50p) for a twenty-word inland telegram over 100 miles.  This fell to four shillings (20p) in 1855,<ref>Kieve, p. 53</ref>  but was still expensive for a typical Victorian worker to use.  A [[weaving|weaver]], for instance, earned on average [[\u00a3sd|ten shillings and sixpence]] (52.5p) per week in 1855.<ref>Ittmann, p. 53</ref>  Further reductions occurred in the early 1860s with both the ETC and the Magnetic attempting to compete with the UKTC's flat one shilling rate.  The ETC stopped charging for the address as part of the message, effectively reducing the cost further.  In 1865, the ETC, Magnetic and UKTC fixed a common scale of charges for all three companies.  The flat rate was to be dropped and a twenty-word message would now cost one shilling (5p) up to 100 miles, one shilling and sixpence (7.5p) up to 200 miles, and two shillings (10p) up to 300 miles. Local messages within London and large towns were sixpence (2.5p).<ref>Kieve, pp. 66\u201367</ref>\n\nThe falling prices stimulated more traffic as the public started to use the telegraph for mundane everyday messages.  This in turn generated a steep increase in profits.  Between 1861 and 1866 the combined net profits of the ETC and Magnetic rose from \u00a399,000 to \u00a3178,000.  This was not solely due to the increasing size of the network, the [[gross income]] per mile of wire was also increasing.<ref>Kieve, p. 67</ref>\n\n== News service ==\nThe telegraph companies offered a news service which was particularly useful to regional newspapers who would otherwise have received the information some time after the event.  The ETC had a staff of journalists for news gathering and by 1854 had 120 newspaper customers.  News items included political news from parliament, stock exchange prices, and sports news, especially horse racing where race results were wanted quickly.  Until telegraph offices were opened directly at the racetrack ([[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket]] did not get one until 1860) the results were taken to the nearest telegraph office by a fast rider.  In places where the office was in [[sightline|line of sight]], the results could be signalled to an observer with a telescope at the office, but only in clear weather.<ref>Kieve, p. 71</ref>\n\nIn 1859 the ETC and Magnetic entered into an exclusive agreement with [[Reuters]] for the supply of foreign news.  Reuters retained the right to directly supply shipping and commercial news to private subscribers in the London region.  In 1865 the ETC, Magnetic, and UKTC formed a combined news service.    There was now only one source of news by telegraph.  This monopoly irritated the newspapers, some of whom campaigned vigorously against the telegraph companies.  This control of the news became an argument for nationalisation of the telegraph system.<ref>Kieve, pp. 71\u201372</ref>\n\n== Submarine cables ==\nTo connect the telegraph to anywhere outside of Britain, submarine telegraph cables were needed.  Development of these was held back for want of a good insulator.  [[Rubber]] was tried, but was found to degrade in sea water.  The solution came with [[gutta-percha]], a natural [[latex]] from trees of the genus ''[[Palaquium]]'' in the Far East.  Gutta-percha sets harder than rubber when exposed to the air but when soaked in hot water it become plastic and mouldable. On cooling it hardens again.<ref>Kieve, p. 101</ref>  The material was brought to the attention of the [[Royal Society]] in 1843 when [[William Montgomerie]], the head of the medical department in [[Singapore]], sent samples of Gutta-percha to them.<ref>Black, p. 11</ref>   Montgomerie had in mind using the material to make medical equipment in place of rubber, which deteriorated rapildy in the damp conditions of the tropics.  However, [[Michael Faraday]] recognised its potential for underwater cables after testing some samples.<ref>Kieve, p. 101</ref>\n\nWheatstone had put plans to the [[House of Commons]] for submarine cables as early as 1840.  In 1844\u20131845 he tested, probably short lengths, of cable in [[Swansea Bay]].  He tried various insulations, including gutta-percha, but he could not find a suitable way of applying it to long runs of cable.<ref>Kieve, p. 102</ref>\n\n=== Cable manufacturing companies ===\n[[File:The Reels of Gutta-percha Covered Conducting Wire Conveyed into Tanks at the Works of the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company, at Greenwich MET DP801249.jpg|thumb|alt=watercolour drawing|Telcon cable works at Greenwich, 1865\u20131866]]\nThe [[Gutta Percha Company]] was founded in 1845 to exploit the new material.  They initially made bottle stoppers, but soon expanded to a very wide range of products.<ref>Haigh, p. 26</ref>  In 1848, on hearing of the potential use for telegraph cables, they modified a machine for extruding gutta-percha tubing into one capable of continuously applying gutta-percha to a copper conductor.<ref>Kieve, p. 102</ref>  Up to 1865, nearly all the cores for submarine cables in the UK were made by the Gutta Percha Company which had a monopoly on the supply of gutta-percha.<ref>Beauchamp, p. 137</ref>  [[S. W. Silver and Co.]] in [[Silvertown]], London made waterproof clothing using rubber and gutta-percha.<ref>Bright, p. 158</ref>  In 1864, an offshoot of Silver and Co., the [[India Rubber, Gutta Percha and Telegraph Works Company]], was founded as a rival cable manufacturer.<ref>Bright, p. 157</ref>\n\nSome early submarine cables were laid with just their insulation for protection.  These were not very successful, they were easily damaged and some attempts to lay cables failed because they would not sink.<ref>Smith, pp. 7\u20138, 22</ref>  The construction found to work well was to twist the cable cores together, bind with tarred [[hemp]], wind tarred cord around the whole group of cores, and then protect the assembled cores with iron wires twisted around them.<ref>Kieve, p. 104</ref>  The Gutta Percha Company never made completed cables of this sort.  Instead they were sent to another company for completion.  These companies were specialists in the manufacturing of wire rope.  The principal companies involved in this early work were [[R.S. Newall and Company]] in [[Tyne and Wear]], [[Glass, Elliot & Company]], and [[W. T. Henley]] in London.<ref>Winseck & Pike, p. 23</ref>  In 1864, the Gutta Percha Company merged with Glass, Elliot to form the [[Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company]] (Telcon).<ref>Haigh, p. 27</ref>  This was done at the instigation of [[John Pender]] with Pender as chairman.<ref>Huurdeman, pp. 132, 136</ref>\n\nBy 1880, cable production was centred on the banks of the [[Thames]] in [[East London]].  The major supplier by far was Telcon, with some work subcontracted to W. T. Henley at [[North Woolwich]] who themselves had become a major manufacturer of electrical equipment with a 16.5 [[acre]] site.  Gutta-percha production was near-monopolised by the  India Rubber, Gutta Percha and Telegraph Works Company, by then a subsidiary of Telcon, at their 15-acre site in [[Silvertown]].  The company operated a number of cable ships, of which the ''Silvertown'' was the largest in the world at that time.  [[Siemens]] also had a cable manufacturing facility at [[Woolwich]].  Exports were a large part of the business totalling well over \u00a32 million in 1873 and 1% of total British manufactured exports.<ref>Kieve, pp. 116\u2013117</ref>\n\n=== Ocean cable companies ===\n{{see also|Submarine telegraph cable}}\n\nThe first ocean cable in the world was laid across the [[English Channel]].  [[Jacob and John Watkins Brett]] had been planning such a cable since 1847.<ref>Haigh, p. 192</ref>  In 1849, the [[South Eastern Railway Company]] conducted a trial of two miles of cable made by the Gutta Percha Company from the ship ''Princess Clementine'' anchored off [[Folkestone]].  The ship was able to send telegraph messages directly to London via a connection to the South Eastern's overhead telegraph line.<ref>Kieve, p. 102</ref>  After several failed attempts, the Brett's company, the [[Submarine Telegraph Company]] (STC), succeeded in connecting to France in 1851.  The company went on to lay numerous other cables to European countries.<ref>Haigh, p. 193</ref>\n\nThe Magnetic had a close relationship with the STC.  From about 1857 the Magnetic had an agreement with them that all their submarine cables were to be used only with the landlines of the Magnetic.<ref>Bright & Bright, pp. 73\u201374</ref>  The Magnetic also had control of the first cable to Ireland.  This control of international traffic gave them a significant advantage in the domestic market.<ref>Hills, pp. 62\u201363</ref>  Both Newall and Glass, Elliot laid cables as subcontractors to the inland telegraph companies.  Newall was prone to fall out with his customers and was often involved in litigation resulting in the company slowly moving away from the telegraph cable business.<ref>Cookson, p. 81</ref>  UKTC laid a cable from [[Newbiggin-by-the-Sea|Newbiggin]] to [[Jutland]], Denmark in 1868, and from there extended it on to Russia.<ref>Kieve, p. 90</ref>\n\nThe British government took a strong interest in the provision of international telegraph connections.  Their assistance included the provision of [[Royal Navy]] ships to assist with cable laying and monetary guarantees.  Two major failures gave them cause for concern; the first [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] in 1858, and the [[Red Sea]] to India cable in 1859 laid by the Red Sea & India Company.<ref>Kieve, p. 117</ref>  Getting a telegraph connection to India had become a priority for the government after the [[Indian Mutiny]] of 1857; the urgent telegram requesting assistance had taken forty days to reach London.<ref>Headrick, p. 19</ref>  The guarantees provided by the government for these two ventures had caused them a financial loss.  In response, a government committee was formed in 1859 to investigate the issue.  In their final report in 1861, the committee concluded that future failures of this kind were avoidable now that the technology was better understood.  They recommended specifications for future cable construction, installation, and maintenance.  After the Red Sea failure, the government no longer provided subsidies or guarantees and left it to private companies to entirely take on the risk of new ventures.<ref>Kieve, p. 117</ref>  A connection to India was finally achieved in 1864 after the [[British Raj#Organisation|Indian government]] laid a new cable made by W. T. Henley from [[Karachi]] to [[Fao, Iraq]] and thence by overland routes.  This route was a shorter distance in ocean than the Red Sea route and in shallower water, but still 1,450 miles.  This was the first really long submarine cable to be a permanent success, many times longer than any other submarine cable at that time.<ref>Kieve, pp. 105\u2013113</ref>\n[[File:Porthcurno Cable Hut - geograph.org.uk - 318569.jpg|thumb|alt=photo|The nondescript hut where the Porthcurno cables were landed]]\n[[File:Inside Porthcurno Cable Hut - geograph.org.uk - 318578.jpg|thumb|alt=photo|The equipment inside the Porthcurno hut]]\nPender's motivation in creating Telcon from the merger of Glass, Elliot and the Gutta Percha companies was to create a company that could make and maintain the first successful transatlantic telegraph cable for the [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]], formed in 1856.<ref>Huurdeman, pp. 132, 136</ref>  With great difficulty, the trasatlantic connection was achieved by 1866, creating a truly worldwide telegraph network.  London could now communicate with most other telegraph offices in the world.  In 1862, a new submarine cable had been laid from [[Cobh|Queenstown]] in southern Ireland to [[St David's Head]] in Wales.  When this was connected to the transatlantic landing point at Valentia Bay (opposite [[Valentia Island]]) it dramatically reduced the distance transatlantic messages had to travel from Ireland to London from 750 miles to 285 miles<ref>Kieve, p. 66</ref>\n\nThe success of the transatlantic cable triggered the formation of a multiplicity of new companies to lay more submarine cables around the world.  Most of these companies were founded by Pender.  Pender's first project was to lay a new cable to India that covered most of the distance in international waters where it would remain in British control and avoid the political and other risks associated with an overland route.  Telcon manufactured the cable and converted the [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']] into a cable ship to lay it.  To limit the risk, Pender founded three companies, each tasked with laying one section of the cable.  The Anglo-Mediterranean Company (founded 1868) laid a cable from [[Malta]] to [[Alexandria]] in Egypt.  From there a short overland cable via [[Cairo]] connected to [[Suez]].  The Falmouth, Gibraltar and Malta Telegraph Company (founded 1869) connected Malta, to [[Porthcurno]], Cornwall with landings at [[Gibraltar]] and [[Carcavelos]], Portugal.  The company was so named because [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] was originally intended as the landing site in England.  In the event, the tiny village of Porthcurno became the largest submarine cable station in the world after numerous other cables were landed there.  The final link was provided by the British-Indian Submarine Company (founded 1869) from Suez via [[Aden]] to [[Bombay]] in 1870.  Once the connection was complete, all three companies were merged as the [[Eastern Telegraph Company]] in 1872.  [[James Anderson (sea captain)|James Anderson]], the captain of the ''Great Eastern'' was made managing director.<ref>{{multiref|Huurdeman, p. 136|Kieve, pp. 115\u2013116}}</ref>\n\nA cable going east from India was laid by the British-Indian Submarine Extension Company in 1871.  This ran from [[Madras]], which was connected overland to Bombay, to [[Singapore]] via [[Penang]] and [[Malacca]].  This met a cable in Singapore laid by the China Submarine Telegraph Company (founded 1869) running to [[Hong Kong]].  The British-Australian Telegraph Company (founded 1870) then connected Hong Kong to [[Port Darwin]], Australia via [[Java]].  This was the end point of the [[Australian Overland Telegraph Line]], running 2,000 miles to [[Port Augusta]] in [[South Australia]].  The three companies were merged as the Eastern Extension, Australasia and China Telegraph Company in 1873.  This company connected Australia to New Zealand in 1876.  Other Pender companies included the Western and Brazilian Telegraph Company (1873), the Brazilian Submarine Telegraph Company (1873), Marseilles, Algiers and Malta Telegraph Company (1870), Eastern & South African Telegraph Company (1879), and the African Direct Telegraph Company (1885).  All these companies were merged into the Eastern Telegraph Company, which became the Eastern and Associated Cable Company and the largest multinational of the 19th century.<ref>Huurdeman, pp. 137\u2013138</ref>\n\n[[File:All Red Line (retouched).jpg|thumb|alt=map showing British possessions and cables in red|British telegraph All Red Line global network in 1902]]\nThe development of the undersea telegraph cable network began in the late nineteenth century. In October 1902 a worldwide network of cables and relay stations \u2013 including some 100,000 miles of undersea cables \u2013 was inaugurated. This was called the [[All Red Line]] and carried long-distance telecommunications to all parts of the British Empire. The idea was to create a network that did not pass through any non-British territory to avoid security and political risks.  It was so called because at that time British territories and colonies were usually coloured red or pink on maps.<ref>Bruton, p. 3</ref>\n\nIn 1928 the British submarine cables still dominated world telecommunications, but they were increasingly under threat from radiotelegraphy.  A particular concern was [[RCA]] in the US, but they were also losing business due to the [[Imperial Wireless Chain]] set up by the British government to connect the empire together.  The transmitters for the Imperial Chain were supplied by the [[Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company]] which was also a competitor outside the Empire.<ref>Huurdeman, pp. 289\u2013291</ref>  The Electra House Group, an informal alliance of British telecommunication companies, decided that they could best compete worldwide by merging the cable and radio companies into a single entity.  Thus, the Eastern Telegraph Company and the Marconi Wireless Company were merged into Imperial and International Communications Ltd, which in 1934 changed its name to [[Cable & Wireless Ltd]].<ref>Huurdeman, p. 291</ref>  The Porthcurno station stayed open for exactly one hundred years, closing in 1970 when the last cable was taken out of service.<ref>Huurdeman, p. 136</ref>  Submarine [[coaxial cable]]s with [[repeater]]s had been in use for some time which carried multiple telephone channels using [[frequency division multiplexing]].<ref>Kragh, p. 810</ref>  There was no real need for distinct telegraph cables any more.  Telegraph was declining and multiple telegraph channels could be multiplexed into a single telephone channel since the 1920s.<ref>{{multiref|Huurdeman, pp. 324\u2013325|Beauchamp, p. 85|}}</ref>  The building is now the [[Porthcurno Telegraph Museum]] and historic archive of Cable & Wireless.<ref>Huurdeman, p. 136</ref>\n\n=== Maintenance and technical problems ===\nMaintenance costs of submarine cables were high.  They were frequently damaged by ships' anchors and the insulation deteriorated over time.  They were most at risk in shallow water near the coast, but very deep water was also avoided because it was difficult to retrieve cables for repair.  In 1868, the expected life of a cable was fifteen years, and most laid to that date had not even lasted that long.<ref>Kieve, p. 90</ref>  A similar problem of deteriorating insulation plagued inland buried cables, the Magnetic suffering the most from this.<ref>Bright & Bright, pp. 72\u201373</ref>\n[[File:Lord Kelvin photograph.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=photo|Lord Kelvin, gave the first mathematical description of retardation]]\nA recurring problem on buried cables, and most especially submarine cables, was the phenomenon of [[Dispersion relation|dispersion]], which produces the effect called ''retardation''.  Dispersion, as it relates to [[transmission line]]s, is different [[Fourier analysis|frequency components]] of a signal travelling along a line at different speeds.  Frequency analysis of this sort was not understood by early telegraph engineers.<ref>Lundheim, pp. 24\u201325</ref>  The effect of dispersion on a telegraph pulse is to spread it out in time.  This is because a rectangular pulse (as used in telegraphy) has multiple frequency components.  At the receiving end it appears as if part of the pulse has been retarded, hence the term.  The problem this causes for telegraphy is that adjacent pulses smear into each other, and if severe enough the message cannot be read.  It forces the operator to slow the speed of sending so that there is again separation between the pulses.<ref>Hunt (2010), pp. 87\u201388</ref>  The problem was so bad on the first transatlantic cable in 1858 that transmission speeds were in minutes per word rather than words per minute.  Thinking he could solve the problem by using a higher voltage, telegraph engineer [[Wildman Whitehouse]] only succeeded in permanently damaging the cable making it unusable.<ref>{{multiref|Schiffer, p. 231|Darella, p. 302}}</ref>  This failure represented a loss of nearly \u00a32 million (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK-GDP|2|1858|cursign=\u00a3|r=-1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|UK-GDP}})) for the Atlantic Telegraph Company.<ref>Lindey, p. 141</ref>\n\nRetardation is worse in insulated cables because the [[electromagnetic wave]] is travelling mostly in the insulation material.  Uninsulated wires on overhead poles, the most common system on overland routes, are little effected, even over large distances.  This solution is not open to submarine cables and the very long distances maximise the problem.<ref>Hearn, p. 51</ref>  The problem of retardation was not fully solved until the introduction of long-distance telephony made it essential to do so.<ref>McNamara, pp. 131\u2013132</ref>  However, various mitigating actions were taken.  The Magnetic, who operated a large number of buried cables, had an instrument which sent a delayed pulse of opposite polarity to the main pulse, cancelling the worst of the retarded signal.<ref>Bright, p. 26</ref>  The [[mirror galvanometer]] of [[Lord Kelvin]] made it easier to read weak signals,<ref>Thompson, pp. 347\u2013349</ref> and larger cables with thicker insulation had less retardation.<ref>Hunt (1997), p. 327</ref>\n\nIn 1854, Kelvin produced a mathematical description of retardation by analogy with heat flow after the fiasco with the first transatlantic cable.  In 1881, [[Oliver Heaviside]] gave the [[Telegrapher's equation|full analysis]] of transmission lines which described how the problem arose and in 1887 suggested how it could be resolved.<ref>Hunt (2010), pp. 88\u201389</ref>  Heaviside believed that adding the right amount of [[inductance]] to the line would completely remove the dispersion effect.  He tried to persuade the [[General Post Office]] (the Post Office) to take up the idea, but he was a maverick outsider and was ignored,<ref>McNamara, p. 131</ref> largely as a result of his long-running dispute with [[William Preece]], the Post Office Chief Electrician (chief engineer).<ref>Nahin, pp. 139\u2013184</ref>  It was left to [[George Ashley Campbell]] in the US to implement the idea when he added [[loading coil]]s to a telephone line for the first time in 1900.<ref>{{multiref|McNamara, pp. 131\u2013132|Nahin, pp. 275\u2013276}}</ref>\n\n== Employment of women ==\n{{see also|Women in telegraphy}}\nThe telegraph companies began employing women as telegraph operators early on in the companies period.  The Magnetic was one of the first to do so<ref>Beauchamp, p. 77</ref> and the ETC started employing them from 1855.  It was a popular, keenly sought job with unmarried women, who had few other good options.  It was a well paid job in nice surroundings.  The ETC paid between ten shillings (50p) and thirty shillings (\u00a31.50)  per week<ref>Kieve, p. 85</ref> and the Magnetic paid a starting rate of ten shillings.<ref>Beauchamp, p. 77</ref>  The District also heavily employed women when it began operating in 1859.  New recruits were unpaid until they completed training \u2013 typically six weeks.  At the end of training they were expected to achieve a minimum transmission speed ({{nowrap|10 [[words per minute|wpm]]}} at the Magnetic<ref>Beauchamp, p. 77</ref> and {{nowrap|8 wpm}} at the ETC).  Failure to achieve this minimum speed resulted in dismissal.<ref>Kieve, p. 87</ref>\n\nThese wages compared very well with other common occupations for women.  A [[seamstress]] working at home, for instance, earned about threepence (1.3p) per day.  The pay was still less than a male operator could expect.  The companies preferred to employ women primarily because of their lower pay and because they were not organised into unions.  Adolescent boys were also employed, but only men ever worked the night shifts.<ref>Kieve, p. 87</ref>\n\n== Public take up ==\nThe ability of the telegraph was first brought to the attention of a wider public on 6 August 1844 when the birth of [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Alfred Ernest Albert]] to [[Queen Victoria]] was reported in ''The Times'' only 40 minutes after it was announced.  A second event was even more sensational when [[John Tawell]] murdered a woman in [[Salt Hill]] (near [[Slough]]) and tried to escape by train.  His description was telegraphed to Paddington station and he was arrested shortly after arriving.  The event was widely reported in the newspapers.<ref>Burns (2004a), pp. 78\u201379</ref>\n\nThe 1851 channel cable caused a major boost in the reputation of the telegraph.  Prices in Paris could be relayed to the [[London Stock Exchange]] the same day during opening hours.  This ability was unprecedented in international communications.  Likewise, news stories in France could be reported promptly to London newspapers.  In the same year, the [[Great Exhibition]] featured many telegraph instruments which greatly enhanced the public awareness of the telegraph.<ref>Kieve, p. 51</ref>\n\nThe biggest driver of public take up was the fall in prices; firstly, through competition by the companies, especially competition with the District,<ref>Kieve, p. 59</ref> and later price control under nationalisation.<ref>Kieve, pp. 193\u2013195</ref>\n\n== Nationalisation ==\nAn early advocate of [[nationalisation]] was Thomas Allan in 1854.  Allan believed that a flat rate of one shilling (5p) for 20 words regardless of distance would encourage wider use of the telegraph, which in turn would lead to more intensive usage of lines and provide the economic case for building new lines.  According to Allen, this could only happen if the [[General Post Office|Post Office]] ran the network as a unified whole.  He compared his proposal to the effect of the introduction of the [[Uniform Penny Post|Penny Post]].  Allan later tried to bring about cheaper telegrams through private enterprise by founding the UKTC.<ref>Kieve, pp. 119-120</ref>  A surprising and influential advocate was John Ricardo, co-founder of the ETC.  Ricardo was a free trade campaigning [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]]  as well as a railway entrepreneur and banker.  In 1861 he wrote a memorandum to [[William Gladstone]], then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and future [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], setting out the case for nationalisation.  Ricardo's argument was that the telegraph was an important government tool for diplomatic, military, and administrative purposes.  He pointed out that in all European countries state control had been in place from the beginning.<ref>Kieve, pp. 120\u2013121</ref>\n\nThe first sign of government disquiet came in 1862 when the Act enabling the UKTC was passed.  Provisions were made to prevent the UKTC selling assets to other companies without permission.  This was to discourage the UKTC from joining the emerging cartel in the telegraph industry.  A further cause for concern came in 1865 when the companies, including the UKTC, set common tariffs and dropped the one shilling/20-word flat rate.<ref>Kieve, p. 115</ref>  In 1863, a Telegraph Act gave the [[Board of Trade]] the power to regulate the telegraph companies on the same basis as other utilities.<ref>{{multiref|Kieve, p. 125|Huurdeman, p. 106}}</ref>  In 1865, [[Edward Stanley, 2nd Baron Stanley of Alderley|Lord Stanley]] the [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]], came out in favour of nationalisation with Post Office reformer [[Frank Ives Scudamore]] leading the campaign.<ref>Kieve, p. 128</ref>  Scudamore pointed out that telegraph offices were often located inconveniently at railway stations outside town, some towns were not served at all, and some had multiple offices from rival companies next to each other.  State control in continental countries, according to Scudamore, ensured a more rational and convenient distribution of offices and cheaper rates led to greater telegraph use.  His opponents pointed to the United States where rates where also cheaper, but with a great profusion of private companies.<ref>Kieve, pp. 129\u2013134</ref>  Many newspapers campaigned for nationalisation.  They were generally dissatisfied with the news service they got from the companies, and they especially resented not being able to choose their own news provider.  They wanted the telegraph merely to deliver the product from their chosen supplier.<ref>Kieve, pp. 144\u2013145</ref>\n\n=== Telegraph Act 1868 ===\n\nBy 1866 it was clear that the government intended to nationalise the inland telegraph.  This had the effect of inhibiting growth of the network.  In fact, in that year growth temporarily went backwards due to a great snowstorm in January.  Every above ground line within a 50-mile radius of London was damaged and the rooftop system of the District was put entirely out of action.  Across the country, the Electric had 450 miles of line damaged.  In May, the [[Panic of 1866]] put a further brake on growth.<ref>Kieve, p. 65</ref>  The financial turmoil and the resultant change of government caused a delay, but did not change the policy.<ref>Kieve, p. 135</ref>  In the following year, significant parliamentary time was taken up with the [[Reform Act 1867|Reform Bill]] and Scudamore's bill did not come before parliament until 1868.<ref>Kieve, p. 136</ref>  The bill did not mandate nationalisation or give the Post Office a legal monopoly.  It merely gave the Post Office the right to set up telegraph services on the same basis as private companies and the ability to purchase private companies or their assets through normal commercial negotiation.<ref>Kieve, pp. 138, 150</ref>\n\nThe resulting opposition from the telegraph companies had been expected by the government.<ref>Kieve, p. 141</ref>  What had not been expected was that the railway companies were going to be a problem.  Scudamore had made no allowance in costing the scheme for purchasing railway wayleaves.  The railway companies started to vociferously oppose the Telegraph Bill.  Many railway telegraph systems were run by the telegraph company that had the wayleave.  If the Post Office were to take over the telegraph company, the railway company would, or so they claimed, have the additional expense of running their own telegraph.  This difficulty came as a great surprise to the new Chancellor, [[George Ward Hunt]].<ref>Kieve, p. 139</ref>  The problem for the Post Office was that they could not take over on the same terms as private companies, effectively becoming servants of the railway companies.  They wanted the lines, but not the terms that came with them.<ref>Kieve, p. 140</ref>\n\nThe government was determined to reach a decision quickly so that future planning was not left in limbo, and rising company share prices meant that delay would likely add to the costs.  In June, the companies started to negotiate, fearing that if they did not, a disadvantageous arrangement would be imposed on them.  A [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|select committee]] under Hunt reached deals with the telegraph companies based on the last twenty years [[Net income|net profits]], and compensation for the railway companies.  By July, opposition had largely disappeared.<ref>Kieve, pp. 147\u2013149</ref>  It was not originally planned to nationalise the UPTC because they had no lines for general public use; all its lines were private wires in which the Post Office had no interest.  However, the UPTC complained that the planned Post Office uniform rate would so damage their business that they would become unprofitable.  This persuaded Hunt that private wires should be nationalised as well.  Another problem area was the cables to continental Europe.  The Magnetic was obliged to send all continental traffic through STC's cables.  The ETC was obliged to use Reuter's [[Nordeney]] cable.  It would be impossible for a unified nationalised organisation to simultaneously meet both contractual obligations.  To solve this, the government purchased Reuter's cables and leased them back to the STC, together with other continental cables acquired by the Post Office.  This was done in a great hurry and afterwards admitted to be not ideal.  Reuters and STC were to remain un-nationalised.  The bill was passed into law as the [[Telegraph Act 1868]], to take effect July 1869.<ref>Kieve, pp. 148\u2013151</ref>\n\nThe government did not immediately authorise expenditure under the Act.  They had become concerned that entrepreneurs who had been bought out would set up in business again undercutting the Post Office flat rate of one shilling (5p) in lucrative city areas (sixpence (2.5p) had been charged in London by the District) with no obligation to serve unremunerative outlying areas.  Consequently, nationalisation was delayed until The Telegraph Act of 1869 was passed.  This amended the 1868 Act to create a Post Office monopoly,<ref>Kieve, pp. 159\u2013160</ref> with the actual transfer taking effect on 1 January 1870.<ref>Kieve, p. 176</ref>  Companies operating submarine cables with no landlines were excluded from nationalisation.<ref>Hills, p. 26</ref>   Any company that had not, so far, been taken over by the Post Office could demand this happen under the Act for the same 20-year net profit basis as before.  Several small companies that the Post Office considered virtually defunct and not worth buying took advantage of this.<ref>Kieve, p. 159</ref>  The [[Telegraph Act 1870|Telegraph Acts Extension Act 1870]] extended the monopoly to the [[Channel Islands]] and the [[Isle of Man]] resulting in the purchase of the [[Jersey and Guernsey Telegraph Company]] and the [[Isle of Man Electric Telegraph Company]].  The Orkneys & Shetland Telegraph Company was purchased in 1876\u201377 and the Scilly Islands Telegraph Company in 1879\u201380.<ref>Kieve, p. 160</ref>  The STC was finally nationalised in 1890, bringing their international submarine cables and cable ships under Post Office control.<ref>Haigh, p. 193</ref>\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nThere was some criticism of the government handling of the nationalisation.  The total price paid for nationalising the telegraph was \u00a35.9 million, compared to Scudamore's original estimate of \u00a32.5 million.<ref>Kieve, p. 161</ref>  By 1876, the total cost of acquisitions and extensions exceeded \u00a310 million.<ref>Kieve, p. 175</ref>  The price paid for most of the telegraph companies far exceeded their capital value due to the 20-year profit calculation.<ref>Kieve, p. 169</ref>  In comparison, the cost of the telegraph across the whole of continental Europe was only \u00a34 million.<ref>Kieve, p. 166</ref>  It was alleged in parliament, somewhat speculatively, that a new UK telegraph system could have been built from scratch for \u00a32 million.<ref>Kieve, p. 166 citing,<br />''Hansard'', 21 July 1869, p. 250</ref>   The discrepancy was largely due to the unbudgeted payments to the railways, but compounded by paying them on the basis of 20 years net profit.  Most of the railway leases had far less than 20 years to run so the Post Office was not going to get 20 years profit from the purchase.  However, it was difficult to avoid once the principle had been established; Reuters went to arbitration over the issue when the government offered them a lesser deal and won.<ref>Kieve, pp. 164\u2013165</ref>\n\nFurther criticism concerned the purchase of the reversionary rights of the railway wayleaves, which had been another unforeseen expense.  Without these purchases, when the lease expired, the railway company would then have the right to use the line for public telegraphy on its own account unless a new lease was taken out.  Another issue concerned the railways free use of the telegraph on their property.  This was part of the leasing arrangement with the private companies and was inherited by the Post Office.  In most cases, the railway company was also entitled to send free messages to stations not on its own line.  The purpose of this facility was supposed to be for the control of trains, but it was heavily abused; in 1891 1.6 million free messages were sent, compared to 97,000 in 1871.<ref>Kieve, pp. 171\u2013172, 191</ref>  The contractual arrangements with the railway companies were so complex that arbitration cases concerning them were still being heard ten years after nationalisation.<ref>Kieve, p. 174</ref>\n\n== Post Office Telegraphs ==\nPost Office Telegraphs, the branch of the Post Office running the telegraph network, placed their head office in Telegraph Street in the old ETC building.<ref>Kieve, p. 190</ref>  \"The ever open door\" was their slogan above the entrance.<ref>Hamer, p. 75</ref>  Immediately after nationalisation, they set about extending the telegraph from outlying railway stations to town centres.  It was their policy to provide telegraph facilities at every office from which [[money order]]s could be sent, a great increase on the existing number.  For instance, the number of telegraph offices in London increased from 95 in 1869 to 334 in 1870.  By the end of 1870, over 90% of telegrams were sent from post offices.<ref>Kieve, p. 177</ref>  By 1872, the Post Office had 5,000 offices and traffic had increased 50% over pre-nationalisation, to some 12 million messages per year.<ref>Kieve, p. 178</ref>  More offices meant installing more lines, plus the lines handed over to the railways for operating their own internal telegraphs had to be replaced.<ref>Kieve, p. 176</ref>  In 1872 there was 22,000 miles of line, 83,000 miles of wire, and over 6.000 instruments.<ref>Kieve, p. 178</ref>  By 1875, the Telegraph Street central office was the largest telegraph centre in the world with 450 instruments on three floors working connections both domestically in the UK and worldwide on the Imperial telegraph network.<ref>Huurdeman, pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n[[File:Hugh Childers, Lock & Whitfield woodburytype, 1876-83 crop.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=photo|Hugh Childers, 1878]]\nThe Post Office decided to standardise on the Morse telegraph system,<ref>Kieve, p. 176</ref> which had been the international standard since 1865.<ref>Orji, p. 57</ref>  A great variety of different equipments had been used by the companies.  The largest company, ETC, used the Cooke and Wheatstone needle telegraph.  It is possible to send [[Morse code]] on a needle telegraph system but this is slower than using Morse sounders.<ref>Moran, p. 201</ref>  This standardisation could not be immediately implemented everywhere, not least because the [[Franco-Prussian War]] prevented imports of German-made instruments.<ref>Kieve, p. 178</ref>  Some needle telegraphs continued in use, mostly on the railways, well in to the 20th century.<ref>Huurdeman, pp. 67\u201369</ref>\n\nIn 1873 Scudamore left the Post Office under a cloud.  He had been taking money out of other Post Office budgets to pay for the unforeseen costs of telegraph expansion, anticipating that Parliament would soon approve more money.  He went to Turkey where he was employed to modernise the post and telegraph of the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>Kieve, p. 180</ref>  The losses of Post Office Telegraphs steadily grew till 1914.  Interest on the capital overspend was not the only problem.  Although Scudamore's estimate of the increase in traffic from expansion proved largely accurate, the operating costs were badly underestimated.  As a result, net revenue was not sufficient to cover the interest on loans and year on year the debt was growing.<ref>Kieve, pp. 180\u2013183</ref>  On the other hand, the Post Office overall remained profitable throughout the period.<ref>Kieve, p. 247</ref>\n\nThe government attempted to stop the rot with a change in policy in 1873.  No longer was it policy to open a telegraph facility at every office issuing money orders in outlying areas.  It would now have to be shown first that the office was likely to be profitable.  There was no proposal to disconnect already connected unprofitable offices.  However, the number of these declined with increasing traffic.<ref>Kieve, pp. 185\u2013186</ref>  The situation was not helped when in 1883, against the wishes of the government and the Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Hugh Childers]], parliament, under pressure from business groups, called for the minimum charge on inland telegrams to be reduced to sixpence (2.5p).<ref>Kieve, p. 193</ref>  In 1885 Postmaster General [[George Shaw-Lefevre, 1st Baron Eversley|George Shaw-Lefevre]] introduced a bill to implement the sixpence rate, which was passed into law.  Shaw-Lefevre tried to mitigate the adverse effects by limiting sixpence telegrams to only 12 words, including the address.  Addresses had previously been free, but would now be charged for on all telegrams.  \u00a3500,000 was spent on new wires and training additional staff in anticipation of the increased traffic.  Traffic did indeed increase enormously, from 33 million messages in 1884\u201385 to 50 million in 1886\u201387 and reaching its peak by 1900 at over 90 million.  At the same time, there was a large increase in the deficit, mainly due to the cost of the increased staff.<ref>Kieve, pp. 193\u2013195</ref>  Despite the losses, the telegraph was retained in national ownership as it was considered a public service.<ref>Kieve, p. 195</ref>\n\n=== Unionisation ===\nIn 1871 the Telegraphers' Association was formed amongst the telegraph clerks in Manchester with the aim of agitating for higher wages.  This was the first active union in the public service.  Scudamore demanded that the clerks resign from the association and then dismissed those that refused.  There followed a strike to demand their reinstatement.  Scudamore blocked the telegraphic transmission of news of the strike to national newspapers.  The resulting protests from the press got him officially censured.  Wages were increased in 1872 and a formal staff structure introduced.  Their pay was still less than the pay in cable and maintenance companies, resulting in more than 2,300 out of 6,000 clerks leaving the Post Office between 1872 and 1880.<ref>Kieve, p. 187</ref>\n\nIn 1868 [[Charles Monk]] introduced a [[private member's bill]] to parliament that extended the vote to Post Office workers and other civil servants.  It became law despite opposition from the [[Benjamin Disraeli]] government and lack of support from Gladstone, the leader of the opposition.  There was concern that organised workers could have undue influence on Members of Parliament, but this fear never materialised.<ref>Kieve, p. 246</ref>\n\n=== Exchange Telegraph Company ===\nThe [[Exchange Telegraph Company]] (later known as Extel) was, like Reuters, a news distribution service.  It was founded in 1862, but was a very minor player until 1872 when the Post Office granted it a license to provide London Stock Exchange prices and other financial news to its customers in London.  Their license limited their operation to within 900 yards of the stock exchange.  Similar licenses were later granted for local stock exchanges in Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Dublin.  These were all linked to a central office from where news could be distributed.  Extel also provided a service for calling the police, or raising a fire alarm.<ref>Beauchamp, pp. 80\u201381</ref>\n\n== Competition from the telephone ==\n[[File:William Henry Preece - Page's Magazine.png|thumb|upright|alt=photo|William Preece, 1904]]\nUsage of the telegraph never developed to the extent predicted by Scudamore.  Despite the introduction of the sixpence (2.5p) rate, it was still too expensive to compete on price with the letter post and, from its introduction at the end of the 19th century, the [[telephone]].<ref>Kieve, p. 196</ref>  Telephones were first introduced to Britain when William Preece exhibited a pair he had brought from America in 1877.<ref>Day & McNeil, p. 998</ref>  In 1878 the Post Office entered into an agreement with [[Bell Telephone Company]] for the supply of telephones.  It was initially only intended that telephone instruments would be hired out as alternatives to the Wheatstone ABC telegraph on private wires.<ref>Kieve, p. 199</ref>\n\nThere then followed the founding of a string of private telephone companies; the Telephone Company had the rights to [[Alexander Graham Bell]]'s patent and the Edison Telephone Company had the rival patents of [[Thomas Edison]].  These two later merged, forming the United Telephone Company (UTC).  Additionally, a number of companies were founded to set up [[telephone exchange]]s, starting with the Lancashire Telephone Exchange Company in Manchester in 1879.  Telephones on private wires were not a threat, but if exchanges were allowed to connect people over more than a very limited distance, or even worse, connect between exchanges nationally, serious damage could be done to the telegraph business.<ref>Kieve, p. 199-200</ref>  Parliament had declined to give the Post Office a monopoly of telephones.  However, telephone ''messages'', the Post Office argued, counted as telegraph messages under the Telegraph Act 1869, so telephone exchanges could not be set up by private companies without a license from the Post Office.<ref>Kieve, p. 201</ref>\n\nThe Post Office announced that they would issue licenses similar to the license granted to Extel in 1872, with a limit of half a mile to the distance an exchange could connect.  The companies challenged the Post Office monopoly in court, but lost the case in 1880.<ref>{{multiref|Kieve, pp. 201\u2013202|Ball & Sunderland, p. 286|Thomas, p. 126}}</ref>  The same year, a new Postmaster General, [[Henry Fawcett]], started setting up telephone exchanges on the Post Office's own account by modifying the ABC telegraph private wire network, and using telephones made by the [[Gower Bell Telephone Company]].<ref>Kieve, pp. 203\u2013204</ref>  The telephone companies launched an appeal against the court decision.  The UTC, which held all the telephone instrument patents, further claimed that Gower-Bell, by selling to the Post Office, were in breach of their license which forbade them to set up their own exchanges.  However, an agreement was reached before it came to court.  The companies were given licenses on more liberal terms and in exchange they dropped their appeal and recognised the Post Office monopoly.<ref>Kieve, pp. 204\u2013205</ref>\n\nThe Post Office now accepted that the telegraph service was going to decline.  Financially, they were in a better position as the telephone business was very lucrative for them.  Not only was there a fixed charge for the licenses, but the Post Office also took 10% of company gross receipts as a [[royalty payment]].  The cost to the Post Office of maintaining the telephone system was insignificant compared to the cost of the telegram system.   The Post Office was careful not to allow the companies to grow into a national system.  They refused the companies permission to install trunk lines in 1881, preferring to provide them themselves and rent to the companies.  Licenses were limited to one year so that only the Post Office had long term control.<ref>Kieve, pp. 205\u2013207</ref>  In response to complaints that the Post Office was hindering the development of the telephone in the UK, Fawcett, in 1884, allowed the companies to build trunk lines.  Nevertheless, telephone development in the UK still lagged behind other countries.<ref>Kieve, pp. 210\u2013211</ref>\n\nIn 1889, the three main companies, UTC, the National Telephone Company, and the Lancashire & Cheshire Telephone Company amalgamated as the [[National Telephone Company]] (NTC).<ref>Kieve, pp. 211\u2013212</ref>  In 1891 the NTC patents ran out and nationalisation was mooted but the Post Office was not ready to do so.<ref>Kieve, p. 213</ref>  The NTC was accused of inefficiency, high prices, and, especially in London, of disfiguring the landscape with haphazard overhead wires.<ref>Kieve, p. 212\u2013213</ref>  When the NTC's license expired in 1911 they were nationalised under the Post Office.<ref>Kieve, p. 214</ref>  After 1911, telegraph usage declined rapidly.<ref>Kieve, p. 236</ref>  At the same time, telephone use grew, especially after 1960; by 1970 there were nearly 14 million telephones in the UK, nearly double the 1960 figure.<ref>Kieve, p. 266</ref>\n\n== Specialist uses ==\n=== Railway block signalling ===\n{{main|Signalling block system}}\nFrom the beginning, Cooke promoted the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph to the railways as a safer way of working, particularly on [[single-line working|single lines]], with the first installations in the 1840s.  Previously, separation of trains had relied on strict timetabling.  [[Absolute block signalling|Block working]], controlled by the telegraph, ensured that only one train at a time could be on a section of line.<ref>Kieve, pp. 33\u201334</ref>  The benefits of block working were not generally appreciated until the late 1860s.  The number of block instruments on the [[London and North Western Railway]], for instance, increased from 311 in 1869 to 3,000 in 1879.<ref>Kieve, p. 239</ref>\n\n=== News service ===\n[[File:Lord Rothermere.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=photo|Lord Rothermere, 1914]]\nPrior to [[World War I]], the telegraph rates charged to news services became a political issue.  There was an extremely preferential rate granted for news providers.  They were charged one shilling (5p) for 75 or 100 words (depending whether it was inside or out of office hours respectively) and then twopence (0.4p) for each additional 75/100 words, including repeat messages to different addresses.  Thus, a journalist could send 100 messages and 99 of them would cost only twopence.  This was not profitable for the Post Office, but the government was reluctant to act because they did not want to antagonise the newspapers.<ref>Kieve, pp. 216\u2013217</ref>  The issue was put on hold when war broke out, but in 1915 the minimum price of ordinary inland telegrams was raised from sixpence (2.5p) to ninepence (3.8p).  The Postmaster General, [[Herbert Samuel]], commented \"If 6d for 12 words is unremunerative, 1s for 100 words is far more so\", let alone the twopence copy rate for subsequent messages.<ref>Kieve, p. 223</ref>  Samuel proposed a new press scale of 1s for 60/80 words and a copy rate of threepence (1.3p).<ref>Kieve, pp. 223, 290</ref>  This was first delayed to 1917 because of the war, and then to 1920 when it was finally implemented.<ref>Kieve, pp. 223\u2013224</ref>\n\nSome London newspaper proprietors, notably [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]], proprietor of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and cofounder of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', supported increased charges, which would tend to discourage new rivals.  In 1926 Rothermere tried to persuade the Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[Winston Churchill]], but the Postmaster General, [[William Mitchell-Thomson, 1st Baron Selsdon|William Mitchell-Thomson]] was against charging an economic rate.  Provincial papers would stop using the telegraph, or be driven out of business altogether, with little saving to the Post Office.  The fixed costs of maintaining and operating the telegraph system would still have to be paid.<ref>Kieve, pp. 225\u2013226</ref>  The press rate was not increased until 1940 when it went up to one shilling and threepence (6.3p) when there was a general increase in all charges.  The copy rate remained at threepence until 1955 when it was abolished.  By that time, with increasing use of the telephone, income from press telegrams had become insignificant.<ref>Kieve, p. 228</ref>\n\n=== Military ===\nThe first military use of the telegraph in action was during the [[Crimean War]] (1853\u20131856).  A submarine cable was laid across the [[Black Sea]] from [[Varna]] to [[Balaklava]].<ref>Kieve, p. 239</ref>  The army found the use of civilian volunteer telegraphists problematic because of their lack of military training.  From 1870, the [[War Office]] arranged with the Post Office for the training of military telegraphists.  [[Royal Engineers]] from the [[Telegraph Battalion]] were employed on state telegraphs and withdrawn for overseas duties in time of war.<ref>Kieve, pp. 240\u2013241</ref>\n\nIn World War I, the telegraph was recognised as being of crucial importance.  Both sides tried to damage the international telegraph lines of the other.  Post Office cable ships were involved in the action.<ref>Kieve, p. 241</ref>  Just a few hours after the declaration of war on 4 August 1914, [[CS Alert (1890)|CS ''Alert'']] cut the German cables in the English Channel, almost completely isolating Germany from the rest of the world.<ref>Corera, Prologue</ref>  In 1915, [[CS Monarch (1883)|CS ''Monarch'']] was sunk by a German mine off Folkestone.<ref>Haigh, pp. 204\u2013205</ref>\n\n=== Meteorology ===\nThe science of [[meteorology]] was greatly assisted by the rapid weather reports made possible by the telegraph.  In 1860 the Magnetic was contracted by the [[Board of Trade]] to pass weather data between London and Paris.  [[Lighthouse]]s, [[Lightvessel|lightships]], and islands got telegraph connections and became weather stations.  There were even attempts to place [[weather ship]]s far out into the Atlantic.  The first attempt was in 1870 with the old Corvette ''The Brick'' 50 miles off [[Lands End]].  \u00a315,000 was spent on the project, but ultimately it failed.  In 1881, there was a proposal for a weather ship in the mid-Atlantic, but it came to nothing.<ref>Kieve, p. 241</ref>  Deep-ocean weather ships had to await the commencement of [[radio telegraphy]].<ref>Kieve, p. 242\u2013243</ref>\n\n=== Emergency services ===\nThe provision of telegraph connections to lightships gave a means of calling for assistance to a ship in difficulties.  Prior to having a telegraph connection, there had been cases of ships wrecked on rocks after being seen to be struggling by a lightship for as long as twelve hours.  For instance, the [[SS Agnes Jack|SS ''Agnes Jack'']] sunk with the loss of all hands in January 1883 in view of a lightship off the coast of Wales.<ref>Kieve, p. 241</ref>\n\nInstallation of street [[Manual fire alarm activation|call points]] to raise a fire alarm by electric telegraph had been installed in Europe as early as 1849 in Berlin.  [[Siemens Brothers]] had proposed a system in Manchester using the now ubiquitous [[break glass]] call points around 1861.  The town council rejected the scheme through fear of hooliganism.  The first system was not installed in Britain until the [[Metropolitan Fire Brigade (London)|Metropolitan Fire Brigade]] in London took it up in 1880, installing 40 call points.  Other towns soon followed and there was a dramatic reduction in serious fires as a result.<ref>Kieve, p. 245</ref>\n\nThe police were an early user of telegraph private wires.  In 1850 [[Scotland Yard]] had a line to [[Charing Cross railway station]].  In 1860 the police stations of the [[City of London]] were connected together using the Wheatstone ABC system.  Church steeples were used to keep the wires high and out of reach of vandals and criminals.  In 1872\u201373 the [[Metropolitan Police]] connected numerous points in their district to police stations.<ref>Kieve, p. 245</ref>\n\n=== Commercial codebooks ===\n{{main|Commercial code (communications)}}\nTelegraph [[codebook]]s consist of a large number of short [[codeword]]s which decode to a whole phrase or sentence.  These were important in the UK, and elsewhere.  They were used by businesses which sent a large number of telegrams.  The idea was to reduce the word count of the message, thus holding down the cost of the message.  This was of particular importance for international traffic which was sent over long, expensive submarine cables.<ref>Kahn, p. 838</ref>  This was much more effective than the common practise of [[telegram style]] \u2013 heavily abbreviated messaging using the minimum number of words.<ref>Wenzlhuemer, p. 247</ref>  In some cases, telegraph codes also served the purpose of maintaining secrecy for commercially sensitive information; companies would develop their own private code.<ref>Godfrey, p. 29</ref>\n\nMany commercial codebooks were published in the UK.  Popular titles included ''The ABC Universal Commercial Electric Telegraphic Code'', first published 1873,<ref>{{multiref|Clauson-Thue (1873)|>Wenzlhuemer, p. 247}}</ref> and ''Bentley's Complete Phrase Code'', first published 1906.<ref>{{multiref|Bentley (1906)|Kahn, pp. 843\u2013844}}</ref>  The ''ABC Code'' was written by [[William Clausen-Thue]], a shipping manager, later to become a Fellow of the [[Royal Geographical Society]].  His codebook was the first public code to be widely sold.<ref>Kahn, p. 838</ref>  Many codebooks were written for a specific trade or industry.<ref>{{multiref|Godfrey, p. 30|Kahn, p. 844}}</ref>  ''Bentley's'', for instance, published a supplement especially for mining.<ref>Bentley (1907)</ref>\n\n''Bentley's'' was written by [[Ernest Lungley Bentley]] and may have been the most widely used codebook worldwide.  It had sold 100,000 copies by 1967.  In 1905, Bentley was working for a shipping agency on the company's private code.  He left to found his own company and develop a code for general use.  He used codewords from ''Whitelaw's Telegraph Cyphers'',<ref>Whitelaw (1904)</ref> published in London in 1904, which contained 20,000 pronounceable five-letter words.  ''Whitelaw's'' could be used to generate 400 million codewords by running any two five-letter words together to make a still pronouncable ten-letter word.  Pronouncability was important because only pronouncable codewords were allowed by the telegraph authorities.  ''Whitelaw's'' was purely a list of codewords; no meanings were assigned to them.  ''Bentley's'' was the first codebook of such five-letter codewords.<ref>Kahn, p. 843</ref>\n\nStarting in 1896,<ref>Godfrey</ref> the [[International Telegraph Union]] (ITU) attempted to control the use of codes in international telegrams to protect telegraph incomes and avoid messages that were difficult for operators to transmit.  In 1875 they reduced the maximum length of a word (telegrams were charged by the word) from seven syllables to ten letters.  In 1879, at a conference in London, they decided that all words used must come from one of eight named languages.  Codes using invented words could then be charged as a [[cipher]] message at a much higher rate.<ref>Kahn, p. 842</ref>  The attempt was not successful.  The rules were abused in the UK and Europe and incoming messages from the US (which was not an ITU member) entirely ignored them.<ref>Kahn, p. 842</ref>  In 1890, in an attempt to stop the abuse, the ITU published a list of a quarter of a million authorised codewords.  There was strong opposition to this as many existing codes would not be allowed under this scheme.  In 1896, they allowed any code provided it was first submitted for approval and the words added to the official dictionary.  By 1901 this had expanded to well over a million words.  The task of maintaining the list had become too difficult and in 1903 the requirement became that words had merely to be \"pronounceable\".  The publication of Whitelaw's 400 million codewords permanently killed the idea of an official list.<ref>Kahn, p. 843</ref>\n\n== Automation ==\n[[File:Lochstreifen-2.png|thumb|left|alt=photo|Punched paper tape as used for Baudot-Murray code messages, c. 1976]]\nOn busy lines, [[multiplexing]] was used to avoid the cost of erecting additional wires.  The Post Office used a system that could simultaneously send four messages in each direction (eight simultaneous messages in all).  These systems were usually used in conjunction with high speed paper [[punched tape]] readers to maximise the usage of the line.  Messages were first typed on to punched tape before sending to the line.  The code used was the [[Baudot code]], invented by [[\u00c9mile Baudot]].  Early keyboards used were Baudot's five-key \"piano\" keyboards (each key corresponding to one of the [[bit]]s of the code, and hence to one hole in each column of holes on the tape). Later keyboards were typewriter-like and used [[Baudot code#Murray code|Murray's 1901 modification]] of the Baudot code.<ref>Kieve, pp. 249\u2013250</ref>\n[[File:Mr W A J Dearn, a motorcycle messenger attached to Wood Green Post Office, 1941. D5245.jpg|thumb|alt=photo|Motorcycle telegraph messenger from [[Wood Green]] Post Office, 1941]]\nThe [[teleprinter]] was invented in the United States in 1915, but was not taken up by the Post Office until 1922, after a British company, [[Creed & Company]], started producing a similar machine in 1921.  From then on, teleprinters started to replace the Morse system,<ref>Kieve, p. 249</ref> and Morse was completely eliminated from Post Office landlines and submarine lines in 1932, but continued in use in [[radiotelegraphy]].<ref>Huurdeman, p. 142</ref>  A teleprinter has a typewriter-like keyboard for sending messages, which are automatically printed at both the sending and receiving end.  The system had great cost savings for the Post Office.  The operators did not need to be trained in Morse and the receiving operator did not need to be attending the machine during receipt of the message.  It was only necessary to fix the printed message to the telegram form for delivery.  Thus, one operator could work several telegraph lines simultaneously.<ref>Kieve, p. 249</ref>\n\nBecause traffic was declining in the 1920s, it was not worthwhile to automate many less busy lines.  Wherever possible, the Post Office closed direct lines and diverted traffic on to the main automated lines by a more circuitous route.  About eighty such circuits were closed.<ref>Kieve, p. 250</ref>  Between 1929 and 1935, on the recommendation of a committee set up by Postmaster General [[William Mitchell-Thomson, 1st Baron Selsdon|William Mitchell-Thomson]] in 1927,<ref>Kieve, p. 250</ref> the old Morse and Baudot equipments were replaced with Creed teleprinters without waiting for the apparatus to reach end of life.  The War Office expressed concern at this change; they would no longer have a pool of trained Morse operators to call upon.  Another innovation in this period was the use of motorcycle messengers to speed up delivery.<ref>Kieve, pp. 255\u2013256</ref>\n\nAutomation, closing uneconomic lines, and staff rationalisation reduced, but did not eliminate, the deficit on the telegraph service.  Between 1930 and 1934 the deficit fell from over \u00a31 million to \u00a3650,000.<ref>Kieve, p. 256</ref>  Towards the end of the 1930s, teleprinter automatic switching in exchanges was introduced, eliminating the need for manual exchange operators.  The possibility of direct dialling between customers' teleprinters was investigated in 1939,<ref>Kieve, p. 260</ref> but nothing was done until after [[World War II]].<ref>Huurdeman, p. 510</ref>\n\n== Decline and recovery ==\n[[File:Female telegraph messenger (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|alt=photo|Female telegram messenger during World War I]]\nThe pre-war decline was briefly halted during World War I, but usage started falling again in 1920 when the minimum charge for inland telegrams doubled to one shilling (5p).  By 1935, with the country in the grip of [[Great Depression|economic depression]], inland telegram messages had fallen to 35 million, less than half the pre-war figure, and just over one third of the 1900 peak.<ref>Kieve, pp. 248, 195</ref>  At the same time, telephone usage rapidly increased as the number of subscribers grew.  Telephone calls grew from 716 million in 1919 to over 2.2 billion in 1939.  Even the number of telephone trunk calls alone, 112 million in 1939, exceeded the number of telegrams.<ref>Kieve, p. 248</ref>  In some cases telegrams were sent or received by telephone (phonograms), making it increasingly difficult to treat the two services separately.<ref>Kieve, pp. 256\u2013257</ref>  By 1939, 40% of telegrams were phonograms.<ref>Kieve, p. 259</ref>\n\nAnother issue that encouraged decline was the introduction in 1921 of telegram delivery by \"walks\" similar to the way mail was delivered.  That is, a group of telegrams were all delivered by one messenger on the same outing over a predefined route.  Previously, a messenger was sent out from the receiving office as soon as the telegram was received.  This eroded the speed advantage of the telegraph over the post, although the time between walks was still usually very short; the postal service was cheaper and could guarantee next-day delivery almost anywhere in the British Isles, which for most purposes was good enough.  Around 800 fewer messengers were required as a result of the introduction of this system.<ref>Kieve, pp. 248, 250</ref>\n\nIn 1935 Postmaster General [[Kingsley Wood]] took steps to increase the usage of the telegraph service.  The sixpence (2.5p) rate was restored, but for only nine words.  A priority service was introduced for an additional sixpence, delivered in a red envelope.  Special envelopes were also introduced for greetings telegrams, coloured gold with a red and blue border, and a dove logo.  This service was heavily publicised to overcome a widespread belief that telegrams usually meant bad news.  The message was hand written rather than printed tape, and the Post Office provided a free diary service for recurring events like birthdays and anniversaries.  In 1939, over 4 million greetings telegrams were delivered and the total number of telegrams got back up to 50 million.<ref>Kieve, pp. 257\u2013259</ref>  Another service introduced around this time was [[facsimile]] by telegraphy (fax).  This was heavily used by newspapers to receive photographs.<ref>Kieve, p. 260</ref>\n\n== World War II ==\n[[File:The Telephone Service Carries On, London, January 1942 D6422.jpg|thumb|alt=photo|Telegraph messengers collecting telephone messages for bombed-out telephone subscribers at an emergency telephone bureau, 1942]]\n[[World War II]] saw an increase in telegraph traffic.  Usage peaked in 1945 with 63 million messages.  [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|Children evacuated overseas]] were given one free telegram per month to stay in touch with their parents.<ref>Kieve, p. 260</ref>  Telegraph operators trained in Morse were considered important enough to make them a [[reserved occupation]].<ref>Kieve, p. 261</ref>\n\nEnemy action caused disruption to the British telegraph system both domestically and in the imperial network worldwide, but communication was largely maintained.  The Central Telegraph Office in Telegraph Street was destroyed in a bombing raid in December 1940.<ref>Hamer, p. 75</ref>  Service was maintained by emergency centres in London set up to cover just such an eventuality.  The financial centre in the [[City of London]] was important enough that messengers were stationed in the street in 1941 to collect telegrams.<ref>Kieve, p. 261</ref>  Italy entered the war on the [[Axis powers|Axis]] side in June 1940 immediately after the [[Fall of France]] to the Germans.  The Italian navy then cut the five British telegraph cables from [[Gibraltar]] to [[Malta]] and two of the five going on from Malta to [[Alexandria]].  This was the most direct route of communication with the British forces in [[Egypt]] and East Africa.  The resistance of the British Egyptian forces to [[Erwin Rommel]]'s [[Afrika Korps]] played an important part in winning the war, and it was vital to maintain a telegraph connection.  Malta was important too because of the threat it posed to Rommel's [[line of communication]].  The telegraph system was resilient enough to do this, but only by a very roundabout route going all round the continent of Africa on submarine cables.<ref>{{multiref|Stephenson, p. 50|Kieve, p. 261}}</ref>\n\n== End of the telegraph era ==\n=== Telegrams ===\nAfter the war, telegram usage went back into decline and the deficit returned into the millions of pounds.  Telegram numbers were 42 million in 1950, under 14 million in 1960, and only 7.7 million in 1970, the lowest it had ever been under nationalisation.<ref>Kieve, pp. 261\u2013262</ref>  Repeated price rises by successive Postmasters General [[Ness Edwards]] and [[Ernest Marples]] to try to keep the deficit under control only made the situation worse by driving traffic down even further.<ref>Kieve, pp. 262\u2013263</ref>  Other measures were the ending or reduction of special prices for certain categories.  These included the end of free messages for the railways in 1967, increase of the press rate, and increase of the surcharge for telegrams to the [[Republic of Ireland]], which had not been part of the United Kingdom since 1922, and officially a republic since 1949.<ref>Kieve, pp. 262\u2013264</ref>\n[[File:Rex Whistler - St Valentines Day Greetings Telegram 1935.jpg|thumb|alt=facsimile|Valentine's Day greeting telegram by [[Rex Whistler]], 1935]]\nOne area that continued to grow was greetings telegrams.  More special occasion categories were added and premium \"de luxe\" telegrams were introduced for some categories in 1961.<ref>Kieve, p. 265</ref>  Business use of public telegrams, once the major user of the service, was now minimal.<ref>Kieve, p. 263</ref>  A greeting telegram unique to the UK was the practise of the monarch sending a message to citizens reaching their hundredth birhtday.  This was instituted by [[George V]] in 1917, and in the 1940s a special telegram bearing a [[Royal Crest]] was introduced.  There were only 24 recipients in 1917, rising to 255 in 1952 and by 2015, over 8,000 messages were sent, but no longer by telegram as the service had been discontinued.<ref>{{multiref|Williams, pt. 1|Seward, p. 256}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969 [[Post Office Telecommunications]], of which the telegraph service formed a part, was made a distinct department of the Post Office,<ref>Pitt, p. 154</ref> and in 1981 it was separated entirely from the Post Office as [[British Telecom]] as a first step to its privatisation in 1984.<ref>Welch & Fr\u00e9mond, p. 16</ref>  British Telecom ended their inland telegram service in 1982.  International telegrams were still handled, of which there were 13.7 million in 1970.<ref>Kieve, p. 266</ref>  However, incoming international telegrams were no longer delivered by messenger, they were instead delivered by ordinary post.<ref>Hamer, p. 75</ref>\n\nThe telegram service was replaced with the ''telemessage'' service in which the message is dictated over the phone to an operator and delivered by post in a yellow envelope similar to the old telegram envelope.  British Telecom discontinued this service in 2003 and sold the business to Telegrams Online.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/connecting-britain/edward-prince-wales-visits-londons-telegram-boys/ \"Edward Prince of Wales visits London's telegram boys\"], ''The Telegraph'', 9 June 2017, [https://web.archive.org/web/20190304162409/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/connecting-britain/edward-prince-wales-visits-londons-telegram-boys/ archived] 4 March 2019.</ref>\n\n=== Telex and private wires ===\nAt the end of WWII, the Post Office restarted their move to automatic switching which had been put on hold for the duration.  Automatic switching was established in 1947 and sowed the seed of the international [[telex]] network that developed from 1970 onwards.  Telex, standing for \"telegraphy exchange\", was a switched network of teleprinters using automatic exchanges.  It was originally a trademark of [[Western Union]] who set up a telex system in the United States in 1962, but soon became a generic name for the worldwide network.  The advantages of telex over telephone were that an operator was not required to permanently staff the station to receive messages, and that a printed message provided a permanent record.<ref>Huurdeman, pp. 510\u2013511</ref>  While the telegram service was declining post-war, in the same period business use of telegraph private wires and telex was growing.<ref>Kieve, p. 263</ref>  Most press traffic was also now on telex or private wires so the increase in the press rate on the public telegram system was of little concern to them.<ref>Kieve, p. 264</ref>  The British military also used telex to link military installations through the [[Cold War]] period.  Their Telegraph Automatic Switching System was used from 1955 until well into the 1980s.<ref>Lord & Sterling, p. 449</ref>\n\nAs office computers became commonplace in the 1980s, telex switched to a new telegraph code, [[ASCII]], which aided integration with computers.  ASCII is a 7-bit code, compared to the Baudot 5-bit code, which means it has enough codes to represent both [[letter case|upper and lower case]] whereas Baudot machines printed in upper case only.  Teleprinters could then be used in conjunction with [[word processor]] programs for instance.<ref>Huurdeman, p. 512</ref>  Increased use of [[fax]] machines drove down telex traffic, a change that was precipitated by the postal strikes [[1971 United Kingdom postal workers strike|of 1971]],<ref>Bennett, p. 579</ref> and most especially [[1988 United Kingdom postal workers strike|of 1988]].<ref>Commission of the EC, p. 15</ref>  Telex was mostly superseded by [[e-mail]] and the [[internet]] in the 1990s.  The number of subscribers in the UK fell from 115,000 in 1988 to 18,000 in 1997.<ref>Huurdeman, pp. 512\u2013513</ref>  One of the last groups using the telex service was solicitors, who used it for [[exchange of contracts]] in [[conveyancing]] amongst other things.  Conveyancing can be done by post or telephone, but telex has an immediacy that the former does not, and provides a written record that the latter does not.  Conveyancing can also be done over the internet, but in the 1990s there was some concern over its security.<ref>Walker, p. 492</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|18em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Ash, Stewart, \"The development of submarine cables\", ch. 1 in, Burnett, Douglas R.; Beckman, Robert; Davenport, Tara M., ''Submarine Cables: The Handbook of Law and Policy'', Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 2014 {{ISBN|9789004260320}}.\n* Ball, Michael; Sunderland, David T., ''An Economic History of London, 1800\u20131914'', Routledge, 2001 {{ISBN|9780415246910}}\n* Beauchamp, Ken, ''History of Telegraphy'', Institution of Engineering and Technology, 2001 {{ISBN|9780852967928}}.\n* Bennett, Robert J., ''Local Business Voice: The History of Chambers of Commerce in Britain, Ireland, and Revolutionary America, 1760-2011'', Oxford University Press, 2011 {{ISBN|0199584737}}.\n* Bentley, Ernest L., ''Bentley's Complete Phrase Code'', London: E.

[[Telegraphy]] is the sending of textual messages by human operators using [[telegraph code|symbolic codes]].  [[Electrical telegraph]]y sends these messages over conducting wires, often incorporating a [[telegram]] service (the delivery of telegraph messages by messenger from the telegraph office).  It is distinct from the [[optical telegraphy]] that preceded it and the [[radiotelegraphy]] that followed it.  [[Francis Ronalds]] first demonstrated a working telegraph over a substantial distance in 1816, but was unable to put it into use.  Starting in 1836, [[William Fothergill Cooke]], with the scientific assistance of [[Charles Wheatstone]], developed the [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph]] and Cooke formed a company to exploit it.  Important components were the [[needle telegraph]] instrument suggested by Wheatstone, the [[Daniell cell|battery]] invented by [[John Frederic Daniell]], and the [[relay]] invented by [[Edward Davy]].\n\nIn 1846 the [[Electric Telegraph Company]] (the ''Electric'') was formed by Cooke and financier [[John Lewis Ricardo]].  The company initially supplied telegraph systems to railway companies, but soon branched out into other businesses and slowly built a network that could be used by the general public.  Many competing companies arose; the most important of them was the [[Magnetic Telegraph Company]] (the ''Magnetic'') formed in 1850.  The Magnetic used the telegraph invented by [[William Thomas Henley]] which did not require batteries.  The Electric and Magnetic companies soon formed a [[cartel]] to control the market.  Most telegraph companies were unprofitable except for the Electric and Magnetic.\n\n[[Submarine telegraph cable]]s were required to extend the telegraph beyond [[Great Britain|mainland Britain]].  Suitable insulation for these was not available until the introduction of [[gutta-percha]] in 1843 by Scottish military surgeon [[William Montgomerie]].  The [[Submarine Telegraph Company]] laid the world's first international submarine cable in 1851 when they connected England with France.  The [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] was laid by [[John Pender]]'s [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]] in 1866 after several failures.  Many more Pender companies were formed to lay various cables connecting Britain with its colonies in India and then on to the Far East and Australia.  Once the cables were laid, these disparate companies were merged into the [[Eastern Telegraph Company]], first established in 1872.  The company was absorbed into [[Cable & Wireless Ltd]] in 1934.\n\nThe inland telegraph companies were [[Nationalization|nationalised]] in 1870 and then run as part of the [[General Post Office]] (the Post Office).  Companies operating international submarine cables were left independent.  A major mistake made during nationalisation was that the estimated costs failed to take into account the cost of purchasing railway company [[wayleave]]s, or even that it would be necessary to do so.  The final bill far exceeded the original estimate.  The telegraph was never profitable under nationalisation because of government policies; prices were held low to make it affordable to as many people as possible and the telegraph was extended to every post office issuing [[money order]]s, whether or not that office generated enough telegraph business to be profitable.  Telegraph usage increased enormously under the Post Office, but it was never as cheap as the postal service and growing competition from the telephone started to reduce its market share.\n\nThe telegraph was an important resource in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] which somewhat delayed its decline.  Decline was also countered with the introduction of special greetings telegrams (birthdays etc.) in 1935 which proved highly popular.  Even so, by 1970 telegram usage had fallen to its lowest ever total under nationalisation.  Repeated price rises to control the deficit drove usage down even further.  [[Post Office Telecommunications]] was separated from the Post Office as [[British Telecom]] in 1981.  This was a first step towards its privatisation in 1984.  In 1982 British Telecom ended its inland telegram service.  International telegrams could be sent by telephone and were received by ordinary letter post.  Some private wire use of telegraph continued after the end of the telegram service, and the [[telex]] system continued in use by an ever-diminishing group of private users.  Most of these succumbed to alternatives on the [[internet]] in the 1990s.\n\n== Early development ==\n[[File:Ronalds telegraph.png|thumb|alt=sketch|Ronalds' eight miles of iron wire strung in his garden]]\nThe first demonstration that an electric telegraph could be operated over a substantial distance was conducted by [[Francis Ronalds]] in his [[Hammersmith]] garden in 1816.  Eight miles of iron wire were strung back and forth between wooden frames.  The source of power he used was high-voltage [[electrostatic generator|friction machines]].  Ronalds offered his system to the [[Admiralty]], but they were already using an [[optical telegraph]] and saw no need for Ronalds' invention, despite the optical telegraph being frequently unusable due to weather conditions.  It was never put to the test, but it is likely that Ronalds' system could not be made to work over very long distances using static electricity generators.  Even the relatively short test system only worked well in dry weather.<ref>Kieve, pp. 15\u201316</ref>\n\nNearly all the telegraph systems that were finally successful used batteries of [[electrochemical cell]]s as their source of power.  An important development that made this possible was the invention of the [[Daniell cell]] in 1836 by [[John Frederic Daniell]].  The earlier [[voltaic pile]] suffered from falling voltage if used continuously due to the formation of hydrogen bubbles around the copper electrode which tended to insulate it.  The Daniell cell solved this problem by placing the zinc and copper electrodes in separate [[electrolyte]]s with a porous barrier between them.<ref>Derry & Williams, p. 611</ref>  The hydrogen is consumed by the [[sulfuric acid]] electrolyte, [[oxidizing agent|oxidizing]] it to water, before it can reach the copper electrode in the [[copper sulphate]] electrolyte.<ref>Hewitt, p. 137</ref>  A later improvement by J. F. Fuller in 1853 replaced sulfuric acid with [[zinc sulfate]].<ref>Derry & Williams, p. 611</ref>\n\nAnother important development was the [[relay]], invented by surgeon [[Edward Davy]] in 1837 and patented in 1838.  The relay allows weak telegraph pulses to be regenerated.  The incoming pulse activates an [[electromagnet]] which moves an [[armature (electrical)|armature]] to which are attached [[electrical contacts]] which close and complete a secondary circuit.  A local battery provides the current for a new pulse through the contacts and onwards along the telegraph line.  Davy's relay was the first device to use metallic make-and-break contacts.<ref>McDonald & Hunt, p. 306</ref>  The importance of the relay lies in that it allows telegraph transmissions over long distances that would otherwise require operators at periodic intermediate stations to read and retransmit the message.<ref>Kieve, p. 24</ref>  Davy began experimenting in telegraphy in 1835, and in 1837 demonstrated his telegraph system in [[Regent's Park]] over a mile of copper wire.<ref>Kieve, p. 23</ref>  He held an exhibition in London, but after his marriage broke down he abandoned telegraphy and emigrated to Australia.<ref>McDonald & Hunt, pp. 306\u2013307</ref>\n\n[[File:Cooke William Fothergill (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=photo|William Fothergill Cooke]]\nThe person who was the driving force in establishing the telegraph as a business in the United Kingdom was [[William Fothergill Cooke]].  He was initially inspired to build a telegraph after seeing a demonstration of a [[needle telegraph]] by [[Georg Wilhelm Muncke]] in March 1836.  He built a prototype shortly afterwards, but did not pursue this design.<ref>{{multiref|Kieve, pp. 17\u201319|Shaffner, 179\u2013185}}</ref>  Instead, he looked for mechanical solutions because he believed that the needle telegraph would require multiple wires, each driving a separate needle.<ref>Shaffner, p. 187</ref>  Cooke initially made a telegraph with a clockwork [[detent]] mechanism operating electromagnets.  The first mechanical apparatus was built in 1836.<ref>Shaffner, pp. 185\u2013187</ref>  He pitched the telegraph to various railway companies as a means of signalling to control trains but without success.<ref>Bowers, pp. 123\u2013125</ref>  Cooke, who was not scientifically trained, sought advice from [[Michael Faraday]] and [[Charles Wheatstone]].  Wheatstone recommended using a needle telegraph system.<ref>Shaffner, p. 191</ref>  After the collaboration with Wheatstone began, only needle telegraphs were pursued.  The [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph]] developed by the two men and patented in May 1837 could have various arrangements of needles, but the one that initially became successful used five needles.  They were operated in pairs so that the pair of needles pointed to a letter of the alphabet marked on a board.<ref>Shaffner, pp. 191-201</ref>\n[[File:Cooke and Wheatstone electric telegraph.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=photo|Cooke and Wheatstone five-needle telegraph]]\nCooke proposed the Cooke and Wheatstone system to the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]],<ref>Hubbard, pp. 33\u201346</ref> and a four-needle system was trialled by the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] in July 1837.<ref>Hubbard, pp. 47\u201355</ref>  Both applications were for signalling with [[cable railway|rope-hauled trains]] but both railways rejected electrical telegraph signalling in favour of steam-driven whistles.<ref>Bowers, p. 129</ref>  The first success came in 1838 when a five-needle telegraph was installed by the [[Great Western Railway]] from [[Paddington station]] to [[West Drayton]].<ref>Bowers, p. 129</ref>  This was the first commercial telegraph in the world.<ref>Huurdeman, p. 67</ref>  The cables were originally laid in an underground conduit, but the insulation started to fail.<ref>{{multiref|Huurdeman, pp. 67\u201368|Beauchamp, p. 35}}</ref>  Cooke replaced the instruments with a two-needle system using only the wires that remained intact.<ref>Mercer, p. 7</ref>  The [[telegraph code|code]] for the two-needle system could not be read off a board; it had to be learned.  The profession of [[telegraphist|telegraph operator]] (telegraphist) had been created for the first time.<ref>Kieve, pp. 32\u201333</ref>\n\nIn 1843 the telegraph line was extended to [[Slough]] and Cooke converted the whole line to a one-needle system.<ref>Huurdeman, page 69</ref>  New wires were run suspended uninsulated from poles on [[Insulator (electricity)#Telegraph and power transmission insulators|ceramic insulators]], a system which Cooke patented,<ref>Kieve, p. 32</ref> and which rapidly became ubiquitous.<ref>Duffy, p. 5</ref>  This extension was done at Cooke's own expense as the railway company was unwilling to finance a system it still considered experimental.  Up to this point, the Great Western had insisted on exclusive use and refused Cooke permission to open public telegraph offices.  Cooke's new agreement gave the railway free use of the system in exchange for Cooke's right to open public offices, for the first time establishing a public telegraph service.<ref>Kieve, pages 31\u201332</ref>  A flat rate of one [[shilling]] (5[[Penny (British decimal coin)|p]]) was charged regardless of message length, but many people paid this just to see the strange equipment.<ref>Kieve, p. 33</ref>\n\nThe earliest machine for sending pictures by telegraph ([[fax]]) is due to Scottish inventor [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]] in 1848.  An earlier, but unbuilt, design was patented by Bain in 1843.<ref>Coopersmith, p. 14</ref>    Another fax machine was demonstrated at the [[Great Exhibition]] by [[Frederick C. Bakewell]] in 1851 with an improved design.<ref>Parsons, p. 13</ref>  Bain also invented a chemical [[printing telegraph]].  He used a dot-dash code with this machine that was similar to [[Morse code]], but with different [[codepoint]]s.  The Bain telegraph had some popularity in the 1850s in England, but when Bain took it to the US in 1849 he became embroiled in litigation with Morse.<ref>{{multiref|Russell, pp. 62\u201363|Morrison, pp. 36\u201337}}</ref>  The dispute broke him financially and he returned to clockmaking, his original profession, in later life.<ref>Burns (2004b)</ref>\n\n== Telegraph companies ==\n{{see also|List of historical British telcos#Telegraph companies}}\nDevelopment of the telegraph in Britain was distinctly different from other European countries.  In [[Continental Europe]], telegraph development was for government purposes and controlled as a state monopoly.  For instance, the early telegraph installations by [[Siemens]] in [[Prussia]] had a distinctly military purpose, and in France it was years before the public was allowed to use the telegraph at all.  In Britain, between 1846 and 1870, that is from the formation of the first telegraph company until [[nationalisation]], the telegraph grew entirely at the instigation of private companies with private capital and without government support.<ref>Kieve, pp. 46\u201347</ref>  Between 1846 and 1868, 64 telegraph companies were formed.  However, 68% of them failed and only a handful of them grew to any significant size.<ref>Kieve, p. 96</ref>\n\n=== Electric Telegraph Company ===\n{{main|Electric Telegraph Company}}\n[[File:PSM V03 D418 Single needle instrument.jpg|thumb|alt=drawing|Cooke and Wheatstone single-needle instrument c. 1872\u20131873]]\nThe [[Electric Telegraph Company]] (ETC) was formed in 1846 by Cooke and financier [[John Lewis Ricardo]],<ref>Haigh, p. 195</ref> and was the first company formed for the purpose of providing a telegraph service to the public.<ref>Kieve, p. 31</ref>  It was formed without Wheatstone as he and Cooke had had a serious falling out over who should take credit for the invention.  The matter went to arbitration with [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] acting for Cooke and Daniell acting for Wheatstone.  A compromise was reached with both of them taking some credit.  Wheatstone was uninterested in commercial enterprises, wishing only to publish scientific results.  The ETC bought out Wheatstone's patent interest in exchange for royalties;<ref>{{multiref|Bowler & Morus, pp. 403\u2013404|Bowers, p. 119}}</ref>  Davy's relay patent was also acquired.<ref>Kieve, p. 24</ref>  The company bought out Bain for the substantial sum of \u00a37,500 ({{Inflation|UK|7500|1846|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3|r=-4}}) because he was threatening to derail the bill forming the company on the grounds that his patents would be infringed.<ref>Burns (2004a), pp. 93\u201394</ref>  The ETC bought out other telegraph patents when they could, often not because they wanted to use them, but as a means of suppressing competition.<ref>Roberts, ch. 4</ref>\n\nThe company at first concentrated on business with the railways but struggled to be profitable.<ref>Kieve, p. 49</ref>  On the other hand, their relationship with the railways gave them a structural advantage over competitors that started up later.  By the time competitors came on the scene the ETC had agreements with most railways.  The railways gave exclusive use of the [[wayleave]]s to the ETC, shutting out competitors from the most economic way of building a telegraph network.<ref>Kieve, pp. 49, 52</ref>\n\nAfter 1848 other areas of business started to grow in comparison to the railways.<ref>Kieve, pp. 44\u201345</ref>  Supply of news to newspapers and stock exchange information to the financial sector were profitable.<ref>Kieve, p. 49</ref>  A major user from the beginning was the insurer [[Lloyd's of London]], and they had telegraph instruments installed directly in their London offices in 1852.<ref>Huurdeman, p. 106</ref>  General use by the public was slow to grow due to high prices.<ref>Kieve, p. 49</ref>  The telegram business grew after competition drove down prices and this led in 1859 to the company relocating their London [[central office (telecommunications)|central office]] to bigger premises in Great Bell Alley, [[Moorgate]], the eastern portion of which was later renamed Telegraph Street after the company.<ref>Roberts, ch. 4</ref>  The ETC remained by far the largest telegraph company until nationalisation in 1870.<ref>Hills, p. 22</ref>  Cooke retired from the company after nationalisation.  Both he and Wheatstone were knighted for their efforts in telegraphy in, respectively, 1869 and 1868.<ref>Huurdeman, p. 107</ref>\n\nThe ETC was heavily involved in laying submarine telegraph cables to Europe and Ireland.  They operated the first [[cable ship]] permanently fitted out for laying cables, [[CS Monarch (1830)|CS ''Monarch'']].  In 1853 they created the International Telegraph Company to overcome Dutch objections to a British company laying telegraph cables on their soil.  This company was merged back into the ETC in 1854, the name of the new company becoming the Electric and International Telegraph Company.<ref>Kieve, p. 52</ref>  Other subsidiary companies created to lay submarine cables were the Channel Islands Telegraph Company (1857) and the [[Isle of Man Telegraph Company]] (1859).<ref>Haigh, pp. 195\u2013196</ref>\n\n=== Magnetic Telegraph Company ===\n{{main|British and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company}}\n[[File:Foster magneto-electric telegraph.png|thumb|alt=drawing of inner workings|Henley-Foster two-needle telegraph]]\nThe English and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company (Magnetic Telegraph Company, or just Magnetic for short) was established by [[John Watkins Brett|John Brett]] in 1850,<ref>{{multiref|Huurdeman, p. 129|Hills, p. 294}}</ref> initially to connect Britain and Ireland with a submarine telegraph cable.<ref>Smith, p. 21</ref>  The first attempt at this failed as did several other attempts by rival companies.  The Magnetic finally succeeded in 1853, giving Ireland a telegraphic connection to Britain for the first time, and through Britain, on to mainland Europe.<ref>{{multiref|Smith, p. 22|Ash, p. 22}}</ref>  This was the deepest submarine cable laid to date.<ref>Bright, p. 14</ref>\n\n{{anchor|British Electric Telegraph Company}}\nThe Magnetic was the largest competitor to the ETC with the two of them forming a virtual [[duopoly]], and in this context the ETC was commonly referred to as the Electric to counterpose it to the Magnetic.<ref>Hills, p. 22</ref>  It was not, however, the first competitor.  That was the British Electric Telegraph Company (BETC), founded in 1849.<ref>Kieve, p. 50</ref>  It later changed its name to the British Telegraph Company to avoid confusion with the ETC.<ref>Roberts, ch.5</ref>  The BETC failed because they were founded on the mistaken assumption that they would be able to obtain railway wayleaves.  They wrongly believed that Parliament would force the railway companies to allow them to erect lines.  In the event, they obtained very few wayleaves; the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] was one of the few exceptions.<ref>Roberts, ch.5</ref>  They were taken over by the Magnetic in 1857 under the new name of the British and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company.<ref>Beauchamp, p. 77</ref>  The Magnetic avoided the pitfalls encountered by the BETC.  From the start, they planned their system based on underground cables along highways.<ref>{{multiref|Bright, p. 5|Beauchamp, p. 77}}</ref> Not only did the ETC have the railway wayleaves, but the [[United Kingdom Telegraph Company]] had the wayleaves for canals and the BETC had the wayleaves for overground cables along highways.<ref>Bright & Bright, pp. 74\u201375</ref>  This asset of the BETC was the attraction for the Magnetic in its takeover of them.<ref>Bright & Bright, pp. 72\u201373</ref>\n\nThe Magnetic used a telegraph system not covered by the ETC patents.<ref>Mercer, p. 8</ref>  It used the needle telegraph of [[William Thomas Henley]] and George Foster which did not require batteries.  Movement of the machine handles while the operator was sending a message generated the electricity electromagnetically.  This was the meaning of ''magnetic'' in the company name.<ref>Beauchamp, p. 77</ref>  After the BETC takeover, the Magnetic acquired the needle telegraph of its founder, [[Henry Highton]].  This instrument was the cheapest available of the manual telegraph systems at between \u00a32 10 shillings (\u00a32.50) and \u00a33.<ref>Morse, p. 117</ref>  By the time of nationalisation, the Magnetic were also using Bright's bells on their most important lines.  The latter instrument was an invention of [[Charles Tilston Bright]] which was acoustic rather than visual and allowed the operator to work faster.<ref>{{multiref|Morse, p. 116|Bright & Bright, pp. 67\u201371 }}</ref>\n\nThe Magnetic not only laid the first cable to Ireland, they also had an exclusive agreement with the [[Submarine Telegraph Company]] which controlled the cables to Europe.<ref>Bright & Bright, pp. 73\u201374</ref>  For a short period, the Magnetic had control of all international traffic, shutting out the ETC.<ref>Hills, pp. 62\u201363</ref>  In Ireland, the Magnetic acquired most of the railway wayleaves forcing the ETC to use roads and canals, the exact reverse of the situation in Great Britain.<ref>Kieve, p. 54</ref>\n\n=== London District Telegraph Company ===\n{{main|London District Telegraph Company}}\nLondon District Telegraph Company (the ''District''), formed in 1859 in London, was a company closely associated with the Magnetic.  John Watkins Brett and Charles Kemp Dyer were directors of both companies and  Edward Brailsford Bright was secretary of both.  Their telegraph operators were trained at the Magnetic's headquarters in the [[Strand, London|Strand]].<ref>Kieve, p. 56</ref>  The Magnetic installed the telegraph lines for the District and leased them back to the District for a [[peppercorn rent]] in exchange for the District passing on the Magnetic's messages to and from outside London.<ref>Kieve, p. 59</ref>  The business model of the District was to provide cheap telegrams within London and not install expensive links between cities.  Prices were [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|fourpence]] (1.7p) for ten words and [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]] (2.5p) for fifteen words.<ref>Kieve, p. 56</ref>  By comparison, a long distance telegram on the Electric cost four shillings (20p).<ref>Kieve, p. 53</ref>  The area of the District was limited to within four miles of [[Charing Cross]], with possible later expansion to twenty miles.  The District avoided the expense of erecting telegraph poles or burying cables by stringing the wires from building to building, a technique that could only be used in heavily built-up areas.<ref>Kieve, p. 56</ref>\n\nRooftop wires may have been cheap to install, but obtaining the wayleaves could be troublesome.  Thousands of individual permissions had to be sought and some unusual conditions were sometimes imposed.  One householder insisted that the installers enter her property only once (after wiping their feet) to access the roof.  Meals were hoisted up to the workmen on the roof until they had finished.<ref>Kieve, pp. 58\u201359</ref>  In all, around seven thousand interviews and negotiations were conducted, many of them equally troublesome, to erect only 280 miles of wire.<ref>Prescott, p. 359</ref>  The cheap prices of the District stimulated a much more casual use of the telegraph; in 1862 the company transmitted a quarter of a million messages.<ref>Kieve, p. 59</ref>\n\n=== United Kingdom Telegraph Company ===\nThe United Kingdom Telegraph Company (UKTC), founded by Thomas Allan, was the last major telegraph company to be formed.  It was registered in 1850, but did not raise sufficient capital to launch until 1860.<ref>Kieve, pp. 61\u201362</ref>  The business model was to provide a [[flat rate]] of one shilling (5p) for twenty words within 100 miles and two shillings (10p) beyond 100 miles, thus undercutting the established companies.<ref>Kieve, p. 62</ref>  The Electric, with the Magnetic's support, put a great deal of effort into obstructing the UKTC.  They challenged UKTC's right to use highways in Parliament, and this was not resolved until Parliament passed an Act in 1862 allowing the UKTC to erect [[trunk line]]s along highways.  The Electric used their exclusive agreements with the railways to demand that they cut down UKTC lines crossing railway property, a demand which the railway companies for the most part complied with.  The Electric also petitioned other landowners to exclude the UKTC, and in some cases UKTC lines were cut illegally.  All this activity made it extremely difficult for the UKTC to establish trunk routes between cities.  The UKTC did have one good option; they had exclusive rights along canals, but they could not reach Scotland or Ireland this way.<ref>Kieve, pp. 63\u201364</ref>\n\nThe UKTC got their first trunk line up in 1863 connecting London, [[Birmingham]], [[Manchester]], and [[Liverpool]].  In 1864, they completed a second trunk along the route London, [[Northampton]], [[Leicester]], [[Sheffield]], [[Barnsley]], [[Wakefield]], and [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]].  The northern end of this line was then linked to Manchester and Liverpool, thus connecting the two trunks together at both ends.  Later, the trunk network was extended into Scotland reaching [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]].  In 1865 the network was extended west, reaching [[Swansea]] and [[Plymouth]].  In 1866, traffic on the UKTC network was nearly three-quarters of a million messages.<ref>Kieve, p. 64</ref>\n\nThe UKTC used the [[printing telegraph]] of [[David Edward Hughes]].  This was an early form of [[teleprinter]] in which the message is directly printed without the operator needing to decode it.  Transmission was from a piano-like keyboard marked with the letters of the alphabet.  The Electric had tested the Hughes printing telegraph in 1858 but decided against using it.<ref>Kieve, p. 65</ref>  The operation of the printing telegraph was mechanical, a spinning wheel with the character [[Sort (typesetting)|types]], similar to a modern [[Daisy wheel printing|daisy wheel printer]], was pressed against the paper at the appropriate time.  The wheel in the receiving machine had to be kept in exact synchrony with the sending machine, otherwise garbage would be printed.  The Hughes machine did this by sending synchronisation pulses down the line.  This was a marked improvement on earlier machines which were slow and temperamental.<ref>Beauchamp, p. 89</ref>\n\n=== Universal Private Telegraph Company ===\n[[File:ABC machine.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=photo|An ABC telegraph instrument from the General Post Office era, dated 1885]]\nThe [[Universal Private Telegraph Company]] (UPTC) was established in 1861 for the purpose of providing private telegraph links for companies and institutions.  The telegraph system they used was the ABC telegraph, also known as Wheatstone's universal telegraph.  This was an instrument patented by Charles Wheatstone in 1858.  It was designed to be used by unskilled operators with no knowledge of telegraph codes.  Letters were marked around a dial with a button for each.  The operator pressed the desired button and then turned a handle which generated pulses of current.  The pulses moved a pointer through successive positions until it reached the button that had been pressed at which point the current was cut off.  A receiving dial indicated the position that had been reached at both ends of the circuit.  Although much slower than other telegraph systems, it was possible to reach 25 [[wpm]] with practice.<ref>Kieve, p. 64</ref>\n\nThe company proved to be highly profitable.  It charged \u00a34 per mile of wire per annum, and had few overheads.  Unlike the public companies, it did not have to staff telegraph offices or employ operators to send and receive messages.<ref>Kieve, p. 70</ref>\n\n== Profitability ==\nOf the inland public companies, only the ETC and the Magnetic were profitable.  The District, with low prices and a troublesome rooftop system to maintain suffered a loss every year of its existence except 1865.  The UKTC had come late to the party and hoped to take business away from the big two with low prices, but they were handicapped by an inability to obtain wayleaves on the best routes.<ref>Kieve, pp. 92\u201393</ref>  The resulting price war ended with them joining the ETC/Magnetic cartel and agreeing a common price structure, thus destroying their original business model.<ref>Kieve, pp. 66\u201367</ref>\n\nCompetition from the District and UKTC, together with economies of scale as the network grew, steadily drove down prices.   In 1851 the ETC charged ten [[shilling]]s (50p) for a twenty-word inland telegram over 100 miles.  This fell to four shillings (20p) in 1855,<ref>Kieve, p. 53</ref>  but was still expensive for a typical Victorian worker to use.  A [[weaving|weaver]], for instance, earned on average [[\u00a3sd|ten shillings and sixpence]] (52.5p) per week in 1855.<ref>Ittmann, p. 53</ref>  Further reductions occurred in the early 1860s with both the ETC and the Magnetic attempting to compete with the UKTC's flat one shilling rate.  The ETC stopped charging for the address as part of the message, effectively reducing the cost further.  In 1865, the ETC, Magnetic and UKTC fixed a common scale of charges for all three companies.  The flat rate was to be dropped and a twenty-word message would now cost one shilling (5p) up to 100 miles, one shilling and sixpence (7.5p) up to 200 miles, and two shillings (10p) up to 300 miles. Local messages within London and large towns were sixpence (2.5p).<ref>Kieve, pp. 66\u201367</ref>\n\nThe falling prices stimulated more traffic as the public started to use the telegraph for mundane everyday messages.  This in turn generated a steep increase in profits.  Between 1861 and 1866 the combined net profits of the ETC and Magnetic rose from \u00a399,000 to \u00a3178,000.  This was not solely due to the increasing size of the network, the [[gross income]] per mile of wire was also increasing.<ref>Kieve, p. 67</ref>\n\n== News service ==\nThe telegraph companies offered a news service which was particularly useful to regional newspapers who would otherwise have received the information some time after the event.  The ETC had a staff of journalists for news gathering and by 1854 had 120 newspaper customers.  News items included political news from parliament, stock exchange prices, and sports news, especially horse racing where race results were wanted quickly.  Until telegraph offices were opened directly at the racetrack ([[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket]] did not get one until 1860) the results were taken to the nearest telegraph office by a fast rider.  In places where the office was in [[sightline|line of sight]], the results could be signalled to an observer with a telescope at the office, but only in clear weather.<ref>Kieve, p. 71</ref>\n\nIn 1859 the ETC and Magnetic entered into an exclusive agreement with [[Reuters]] for the supply of foreign news.  Reuters retained the right to directly supply shipping and commercial news to private subscribers in the London region.  In 1865 the ETC, Magnetic, and UKTC formed a combined news service.    There was now only one source of news by telegraph.  This monopoly irritated the newspapers, some of whom campaigned vigorously against the telegraph companies.  This control of the news became an argument for nationalisation of the telegraph system.<ref>Kieve, pp. 71\u201372</ref>\n\n== Submarine cables ==\nTo connect the telegraph to anywhere outside of Britain, submarine telegraph cables were needed.  Development of these was held back for want of a good insulator.  [[Rubber]] was tried, but was found to degrade in sea water.  The solution came with [[gutta-percha]], a natural [[latex]] from trees of the genus ''[[Palaquium]]'' in the Far East.  Gutta-percha sets harder than rubber when exposed to the air but when soaked in hot water it become plastic and mouldable. On cooling it hardens again.<ref>Kieve, p. 101</ref>  The material was brought to the attention of the [[Royal Society]] in 1843 when [[William Montgomerie]], the head of the medical department in [[Singapore]], sent samples of Gutta-percha to them.<ref>Black, p. 11</ref>   Montgomerie had in mind using the material to make medical equipment in place of rubber, which deteriorated rapildy in the damp conditions of the tropics.  However, [[Michael Faraday]] recognised its potential for underwater cables after testing some samples.<ref>Kieve, p. 101</ref>\n\nWheatstone had put plans to the [[House of Commons]] for submarine cables as early as 1840.  In 1844\u20131845 he tested, probably short lengths, of cable in [[Swansea Bay]].  He tried various insulations, including gutta-percha, but he could not find a suitable way of applying it to long runs of cable.<ref>Kieve, p. 102</ref>\n\n=== Cable manufacturing companies ===\n[[File:The Reels of Gutta-percha Covered Conducting Wire Conveyed into Tanks at the Works of the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company, at Greenwich MET DP801249.jpg|thumb|alt=watercolour drawing|Telcon cable works at Greenwich, 1865\u20131866]]\nThe [[Gutta Percha Company]] was founded in 1845 to exploit the new material.  They initially made bottle stoppers, but soon expanded to a very wide range of products.<ref>Haigh, p. 26</ref>  In 1848, on hearing of the potential use for telegraph cables, they modified a machine for extruding gutta-percha tubing into one capable of continuously applying gutta-percha to a copper conductor.<ref>Kieve, p. 102</ref>  Up to 1865, nearly all the cores for submarine cables in the UK were made by the Gutta Percha Company which had a monopoly on the supply of gutta-percha.<ref>Beauchamp, p. 137</ref>  [[S. W. Silver and Co.]] in [[Silvertown]], London made waterproof clothing using rubber and gutta-percha.<ref>Bright, p. 158</ref>  In 1864, an offshoot of Silver and Co., the [[India Rubber, Gutta Percha and Telegraph Works Company]], was founded as a rival cable manufacturer.<ref>Bright, p. 157</ref>\n\nSome early submarine cables were laid with just their insulation for protection.  These were not very successful, they were easily damaged and some attempts to lay cables failed because they would not sink.<ref>Smith, pp. 7\u20138, 22</ref>  The construction found to work well was to twist the cable cores together, bind with tarred [[hemp]], wind tarred cord around the whole group of cores, and then protect the assembled cores with iron wires twisted around them.<ref>Kieve, p. 104</ref>  The Gutta Percha Company never made completed cables of this sort.  Instead they were sent to another company for completion.  These companies were specialists in the manufacturing of wire rope.  The principal companies involved in this early work were [[R.S. Newall and Company]] in [[Tyne and Wear]], [[Glass, Elliot & Company]], and [[W. T. Henley]] in London.<ref>Winseck & Pike, p. 23</ref>  In 1864, the Gutta Percha Company merged with Glass, Elliot to form the [[Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company]] (Telcon).<ref>Haigh, p. 27</ref>  This was done at the instigation of [[John Pender]] with Pender as chairman.<ref>Huurdeman, pp. 132, 136</ref>\n\nBy 1880, cable production was centred on the banks of the [[Thames]] in [[East London]].  The major supplier by far was Telcon, with some work subcontracted to W. T. Henley at [[North Woolwich]] who themselves had become a major manufacturer of electrical equipment with a 16.5 [[acre]] site.  Gutta-percha production was near-monopolised by the  India Rubber, Gutta Percha and Telegraph Works Company, by then a subsidiary of Telcon, at their 15-acre site in [[Silvertown]].  The company operated a number of cable ships, of which the ''Silvertown'' was the largest in the world at that time.  [[Siemens]] also had a cable manufacturing facility at [[Woolwich]].  Exports were a large part of the business totalling well over \u00a32 million in 1873 and 1% of total British manufactured exports.<ref>Kieve, pp. 116\u2013117</ref>\n\n=== Ocean cable companies ===\n{{see also|Submarine telegraph cable}}\n\nThe first ocean cable in the world was laid across the [[English Channel]].  [[Jacob and John Watkins Brett]] had been planning such a cable since 1847.<ref>Haigh, p. 192</ref>  In 1849, the [[South Eastern Railway Company]] conducted a trial of two miles of cable made by the Gutta Percha Company from the ship ''Princess Clementine'' anchored off [[Folkestone]].  The ship was able to send telegraph messages directly to London via a connection to the South Eastern's overhead telegraph line.<ref>Kieve, p. 102</ref>  After several failed attempts, the Brett's company, the [[Submarine Telegraph Company]] (STC), succeeded in connecting to France in 1851.  The company went on to lay numerous other cables to European countries.<ref>Haigh, p. 193</ref>\n\nThe Magnetic had a close relationship with the STC.  From about 1857 the Magnetic had an agreement with them that all their submarine cables were to be used only with the landlines of the Magnetic.<ref>Bright & Bright, pp. 73\u201374</ref>  The Magnetic also had control of the first cable to Ireland.  This control of international traffic gave them a significant advantage in the domestic market.<ref>Hills, pp. 62\u201363</ref>  Both Newall and Glass, Elliot laid cables as subcontractors to the inland telegraph companies.  Newall was prone to fall out with his customers and was often involved in litigation resulting in the company slowly moving away from the telegraph cable business.<ref>Cookson, p. 81</ref>  UKTC laid a cable from [[Newbiggin-by-the-Sea|Newbiggin]] to [[Jutland]], Denmark in 1868, and from there extended it on to Russia.<ref>Kieve, p. 90</ref>\n\nThe British government took a strong interest in the provision of international telegraph connections.  Their assistance included the provision of [[Royal Navy]] ships to assist with cable laying and monetary guarantees.  Two major failures gave them cause for concern; the first [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] in 1858, and the [[Red Sea]] to India cable in 1859 laid by the Red Sea & India Company.<ref>Kieve, p. 117</ref>  Getting a telegraph connection to India had become a priority for the government after the [[Indian Mutiny]] of 1857; the urgent telegram requesting assistance had taken forty days to reach London.<ref>Headrick, p. 19</ref>  The guarantees provided by the government for these two ventures had caused them a financial loss.  In response, a government committee was formed in 1859 to investigate the issue.  In their final report in 1861, the committee concluded that future failures of this kind were avoidable now that the technology was better understood.  They recommended specifications for future cable construction, installation, and maintenance.  After the Red Sea failure, the government no longer provided subsidies or guarantees and left it to private companies to entirely take on the risk of new ventures.<ref>Kieve, p. 117</ref>  A connection to India was finally achieved in 1864 after the [[British Raj#Organisation|Indian government]] laid a new cable made by W. T. Henley from [[Karachi]] to [[Fao, Iraq]] and thence by overland routes.  This route was a shorter distance in ocean than the Red Sea route and in shallower water, but still 1,450 miles.  This was the first really long submarine cable to be a permanent success, many times longer than any other submarine cable at that time.<ref>Kieve, pp. 105\u2013113</ref>\n[[File:Porthcurno Cable Hut - geograph.org.uk - 318569.jpg|thumb|alt=photo|The nondescript hut where the Porthcurno cables were landed]]\n[[File:Inside Porthcurno Cable Hut - geograph.org.uk - 318578.jpg|thumb|alt=photo|The equipment inside the Porthcurno hut]]\nPender's motivation in creating Telcon from the merger of Glass, Elliot and the Gutta Percha companies was to create a company that could make and maintain the first successful transatlantic telegraph cable for the [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]], formed in 1856.<ref>Huurdeman, pp. 132, 136</ref>  With great difficulty, the trasatlantic connection was achieved by 1866, creating a truly worldwide telegraph network.  London could now communicate with most other telegraph offices in the world.  In 1862, a new submarine cable had been laid from [[Cobh|Queenstown]] in southern Ireland to [[St David's Head]] in Wales.  When this was connected to the transatlantic landing point at Valentia Bay (opposite [[Valentia Island]]) it dramatically reduced the distance transatlantic messages had to travel from Ireland to London from 750 miles to 285 miles<ref>Kieve, p. 66</ref>\n\nThe success of the transatlantic cable triggered the formation of a multiplicity of new companies to lay more submarine cables around the world.  Most of these companies were founded by Pender.  Pender's first project was to lay a new cable to India that covered most of the distance in international waters where it would remain in British control and avoid the political and other risks associated with an overland route.  Telcon manufactured the cable and converted the [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']] into a cable ship to lay it.  To limit the risk, Pender founded three companies, each tasked with laying one section of the cable.  The Anglo-Mediterranean Company (founded 1868) laid a cable from [[Malta]] to [[Alexandria]] in Egypt.  From there a short overland cable via [[Cairo]] connected to [[Suez]].  The Falmouth, Gibraltar and Malta Telegraph Company (founded 1869) connected Malta, to [[Porthcurno]], Cornwall with landings at [[Gibraltar]] and [[Carcavelos]], Portugal.  The company was so named because [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] was originally intended as the landing site in England.  In the event, the tiny village of Porthcurno became the largest submarine cable station in the world after numerous other cables were landed there.  The final link was provided by the British-Indian Submarine Company (founded 1869) from Suez via [[Aden]] to [[Bombay]] in 1870.  Once the connection was complete, all three companies were merged as the [[Eastern Telegraph Company]] in 1872.  [[James Anderson (sea captain)|James Anderson]], the captain of the ''Great Eastern'' was made managing director.<ref>{{multiref|Huurdeman, p. 136|Kieve, pp. 115\u2013116}}</ref>\n\nA cable going east from India was laid by the British-Indian Submarine Extension Company in 1871.  This ran from [[Madras]], which was connected overland to Bombay, to [[Singapore]] via [[Penang]] and [[Malacca]].  This met a cable in Singapore laid by the China Submarine Telegraph Company (founded 1869) running to [[Hong Kong]].  The British-Australian Telegraph Company (founded 1870) then connected Hong Kong to [[Port Darwin]], Australia via [[Java]].  This was the end point of the [[Australian Overland Telegraph Line]], running 2,000 miles to [[Port Augusta]] in [[South Australia]].  The three companies were merged as the Eastern Extension, Australasia and China Telegraph Company in 1873.  This company connected Australia to New Zealand in 1876.  Other Pender companies included the Western and Brazilian Telegraph Company (1873), the Brazilian Submarine Telegraph Company (1873), Marseilles, Algiers and Malta Telegraph Company (1870), Eastern & South African Telegraph Company (1879), and the African Direct Telegraph Company (1885).  All these companies were merged into the Eastern Telegraph Company, which became the Eastern and Associated Cable Company and the largest multinational of the 19th century.<ref>Huurdeman, pp. 137\u2013138</ref>\n\n[[File:All Red Line (retouched).jpg|thumb|alt=map showing British possessions and cables in red|British telegraph All Red Line global network in 1902]]\nThe development of the undersea telegraph cable network began in the late nineteenth century. In October 1902 a worldwide network of cables and relay stations \u2013 including some 100,000 miles of undersea cables \u2013 was inaugurated. This was called the [[All Red Line]] and carried long-distance telecommunications to all parts of the British Empire. The idea was to create a network that did not pass through any non-British territory to avoid security and political risks.  It was so called because at that time British territories and colonies were usually coloured red or pink on maps.<ref>Bruton, p. 3</ref>\n\nIn 1928 the British submarine cables still dominated world telecommunications, but they were increasingly under threat from radiotelegraphy.  A particular concern was [[RCA]] in the US, but they were also losing business due to the [[Imperial Wireless Chain]] set up by the British government to connect the empire together.  The transmitters for the Imperial Chain were supplied by the [[Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company]] which was also a competitor outside the Empire.<ref>Huurdeman, pp. 289\u2013291</ref>  The Electra House Group, an informal alliance of British telecommunication companies, decided that they could best compete worldwide by merging the cable and radio companies into a single entity.  Thus, the Eastern Telegraph Company and the Marconi Wireless Company were merged into Imperial and International Communications Ltd, which in 1934 changed its name to [[Cable & Wireless Ltd]].<ref>Huurdeman, p. 291</ref>  The Porthcurno station stayed open for exactly one hundred years, closing in 1970 when the last cable was taken out of service.<ref>Huurdeman, p. 136</ref>  Submarine [[coaxial cable]]s with [[repeater]]s had been in use for some time which carried multiple telephone channels using [[frequency division multiplexing]].<ref>Kragh, p. 810</ref>  There was no real need for distinct telegraph cables any more.  Telegraph was declining and multiple telegraph channels could be multiplexed into a single telephone channel since the 1920s.<ref>{{multiref|Huurdeman, pp. 324\u2013325|Beauchamp, p. 85|}}</ref>  The building is now the [[Porthcurno Telegraph Museum]] and historic archive of Cable & Wireless.<ref>Huurdeman, p. 136</ref>\n\n=== Maintenance and technical problems ===\nMaintenance costs of submarine cables were high.  They were frequently damaged by ships' anchors and the insulation deteriorated over time.  They were most at risk in shallow water near the coast, but very deep water was also avoided because it was difficult to retrieve cables for repair.  In 1868, the expected life of a cable was fifteen years, and most laid to that date had not even lasted that long.<ref>Kieve, p. 90</ref>  A similar problem of deteriorating insulation plagued inland buried cables, the Magnetic suffering the most from this.<ref>Bright & Bright, pp. 72\u201373</ref>\n[[File:Lord Kelvin photograph.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=photo|Lord Kelvin, gave the first mathematical description of retardation]]\nA recurring problem on buried cables, and most especially submarine cables, was the phenomenon of [[Dispersion relation|dispersion]], which produces the effect called ''retardation''.  Dispersion, as it relates to [[transmission line]]s, is different [[Fourier analysis|frequency components]] of a signal travelling along a line at different speeds.  Frequency analysis of this sort was not understood by early telegraph engineers.<ref>Lundheim, pp. 24\u201325</ref>  The effect of dispersion on a telegraph pulse is to spread it out in time.  This is because a rectangular pulse (as used in telegraphy) has multiple frequency components.  At the receiving end it appears as if part of the pulse has been retarded, hence the term.  The problem this causes for telegraphy is that adjacent pulses smear into each other, and if severe enough the message cannot be read.  It forces the operator to slow the speed of sending so that there is again separation between the pulses.<ref>Hunt (2010), pp. 87\u201388</ref>  The problem was so bad on the first transatlantic cable in 1858 that transmission speeds were in minutes per word rather than words per minute.  Thinking he could solve the problem by using a higher voltage, telegraph engineer [[Wildman Whitehouse]] only succeeded in permanently damaging the cable making it unusable.<ref>{{multiref|Schiffer, p. 231|Darella, p. 302}}</ref>  This failure represented a loss of nearly \u00a32 million (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK-GDP|2|1858|cursign=\u00a3|r=-1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|UK-GDP}})) for the Atlantic Telegraph Company.<ref>Lindey, p. 141</ref>\n\nRetardation is worse in insulated cables because the [[electromagnetic wave]] is travelling mostly in the insulation material.  Uninsulated wires on overhead poles, the most common system on overland routes, are little effected, even over large distances.  This solution is not open to submarine cables and the very long distances maximise the problem.<ref>Hearn, p. 51</ref>  The problem of retardation was not fully solved until the introduction of long-distance telephony made it essential to do so.<ref>McNamara, pp. 131\u2013132</ref>  However, various mitigating actions were taken.  The Magnetic, who operated a large number of buried cables, had an instrument which sent a delayed pulse of opposite polarity to the main pulse, cancelling the worst of the retarded signal.<ref>Bright, p. 26</ref>  The [[mirror galvanometer]] of [[Lord Kelvin]] made it easier to read weak signals,<ref>Thompson, pp. 347\u2013349</ref> and larger cables with thicker insulation had less retardation.<ref>Hunt (1997), p. 327</ref>\n\nIn 1854, Kelvin produced a mathematical description of retardation by analogy with heat flow after the fiasco with the first transatlantic cable.  In 1881, [[Oliver Heaviside]] gave the [[Telegrapher's equation|full analysis]] of transmission lines which described how the problem arose and in 1887 suggested how it could be resolved.<ref>Hunt (2010), pp. 88\u201389</ref>  Heaviside believed that adding the right amount of [[inductance]] to the line would completely remove the dispersion effect.  He tried to persuade the [[General Post Office]] (the Post Office) to take up the idea, but he was a maverick outsider and was ignored,<ref>McNamara, p. 131</ref> largely as a result of his long-running dispute with [[William Preece]], the Post Office Chief Electrician (chief engineer).<ref>Nahin, pp. 139\u2013184</ref>  It was left to [[George Ashley Campbell]] in the US to implement the idea when he added [[loading coil]]s to a telephone line for the first time in 1900.<ref>{{multiref|McNamara, pp. 131\u2013132|Nahin, pp. 275\u2013276}}</ref>\n\n== Employment of women ==\n{{see also|Women in telegraphy}}\nThe telegraph companies began employing women as telegraph operators early on in the companies period.  The Magnetic was one of the first to do so<ref>Beauchamp, p. 77</ref> and the ETC started employing them from 1855.  It was a popular, keenly sought job with unmarried women, who had few other good options.  It was a well paid job in nice surroundings.  The ETC paid between ten shillings (50p) and thirty shillings (\u00a31.50)  per week<ref>Kieve, p. 85</ref> and the Magnetic paid a starting rate of ten shillings.<ref>Beauchamp, p. 77</ref>  The District also heavily employed women when it began operating in 1859.  New recruits were unpaid until they completed training \u2013 typically six weeks.  At the end of training they were expected to achieve a minimum transmission speed ({{nowrap|10 [[words per minute|wpm]]}} at the Magnetic<ref>Beauchamp, p. 77</ref> and {{nowrap|8 wpm}} at the ETC).  Failure to achieve this minimum speed resulted in dismissal.<ref>Kieve, p. 87</ref>\n\nThese wages compared very well with other common occupations for women.  A [[seamstress]] working at home, for instance, earned about threepence (1.3p) per day.  The pay was still less than a male operator could expect.  The companies preferred to employ women primarily because of their lower pay and because they were not organised into unions.  Adolescent boys were also employed, but only men ever worked the night shifts.<ref>Kieve, p. 87</ref>\n\n== Public take up ==\nThe ability of the telegraph was first brought to the attention of a wider public on 6 August 1844 when the birth of [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Alfred Ernest Albert]] to [[Queen Victoria]] was reported in ''The Times'' only 40 minutes after it was announced.  A second event was even more sensational when [[John Tawell]] murdered a woman in [[Salt Hill]] (near [[Slough]]) and tried to escape by train.  His description was telegraphed to Paddington station and he was arrested shortly after arriving.  The event was widely reported in the newspapers.<ref>Burns (2004a), pp. 78\u201379</ref>\n\nThe 1851 channel cable caused a major boost in the reputation of the telegraph.  Prices in Paris could be relayed to the [[London Stock Exchange]] the same day during opening hours.  This ability was unprecedented in international communications.  Likewise, news stories in France could be reported promptly to London newspapers.  In the same year, the [[Great Exhibition]] featured many telegraph instruments which greatly enhanced the public awareness of the telegraph.<ref>Kieve, p. 51</ref>\n\nThe biggest driver of public take up was the fall in prices; firstly, through competition by the companies, especially competition with the District,<ref>Kieve, p. 59</ref> and later price control under nationalisation.<ref>Kieve, pp. 193\u2013195</ref>\n\n== Nationalisation ==\nAn early advocate of [[nationalisation]] was Thomas Allan in 1854.  Allan believed that a flat rate of one shilling (5p) for 20 words regardless of distance would encourage wider use of the telegraph, which in turn would lead to more intensive usage of lines and provide the economic case for building new lines.  According to Allen, this could only happen if the [[General Post Office|Post Office]] ran the network as a unified whole.  He compared his proposal to the effect of the introduction of the [[Uniform Penny Post|Penny Post]].  Allan later tried to bring about cheaper telegrams through private enterprise by founding the UKTC.<ref>Kieve, pp. 119-120</ref>  A surprising and influential advocate was John Ricardo, co-founder of the ETC.  Ricardo was a free trade campaigning [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]]  as well as a railway entrepreneur and banker.  In 1861 he wrote a memorandum to [[William Gladstone]], then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and future [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], setting out the case for nationalisation.  Ricardo's argument was that the telegraph was an important government tool for diplomatic, military, and administrative purposes.  He pointed out that in all European countries state control had been in place from the beginning.<ref>Kieve, pp. 120\u2013121</ref>\n\nThe first sign of government disquiet came in 1862 when the Act enabling the UKTC was passed.  Provisions were made to prevent the UKTC selling assets to other companies without permission.  This was to discourage the UKTC from joining the emerging cartel in the telegraph industry.  A further cause for concern came in 1865 when the companies, including the UKTC, set common tariffs and dropped the one shilling/20-word flat rate.<ref>Kieve, p. 115</ref>  In 1863, a Telegraph Act gave the [[Board of Trade]] the power to regulate the telegraph companies on the same basis as other utilities.<ref>{{multiref|Kieve, p. 125|Huurdeman, p. 106}}</ref>  In 1865, [[Edward Stanley, 2nd Baron Stanley of Alderley|Lord Stanley]] the [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]], came out in favour of nationalisation with Post Office reformer [[Frank Ives Scudamore]] leading the campaign.<ref>Kieve, p. 128</ref>  Scudamore pointed out that telegraph offices were often located inconveniently at railway stations outside town, some towns were not served at all, and some had multiple offices from rival companies next to each other.  State control in continental countries, according to Scudamore, ensured a more rational and convenient distribution of offices and cheaper rates led to greater telegraph use.  His opponents pointed to the United States where rates where also cheaper, but with a great profusion of private companies.<ref>Kieve, pp. 129\u2013134</ref>  Many newspapers campaigned for nationalisation.  They were generally dissatisfied with the news service they got from the companies, and they especially resented not being able to choose their own news provider.  They wanted the telegraph merely to deliver the product from their chosen supplier.<ref>Kieve, pp. 144\u2013145</ref>\n\n=== Telegraph Act 1868 ===\n\nBy 1866 it was clear that the government intended to nationalise the inland telegraph.  This had the effect of inhibiting growth of the network.  In fact, in that year growth temporarily went backwards due to a great snowstorm in January.  Every above ground line within a 50-mile radius of London was damaged and the rooftop system of the District was put entirely out of action.  Across the country, the Electric had 450 miles of line damaged.  In May, the [[Panic of 1866]] put a further brake on growth.<ref>Kieve, p. 65</ref>  The financial turmoil and the resultant change of government caused a delay, but did not change the policy.<ref>Kieve, p. 135</ref>  In the following year, significant parliamentary time was taken up with the [[Reform Act 1867|Reform Bill]] and Scudamore's bill did not come before parliament until 1868.<ref>Kieve, p. 136</ref>  The bill did not mandate nationalisation or give the Post Office a legal monopoly.  It merely gave the Post Office the right to set up telegraph services on the same basis as private companies and the ability to purchase private companies or their assets through normal commercial negotiation.<ref>Kieve, pp. 138, 150</ref>\n\nThe resulting opposition from the telegraph companies had been expected by the government.<ref>Kieve, p. 141</ref>  What had not been expected was that the railway companies were going to be a problem.  Scudamore had made no allowance in costing the scheme for purchasing railway wayleaves.  The railway companies started to vociferously oppose the Telegraph Bill.  Many railway telegraph systems were run by the telegraph company that had the wayleave.  If the Post Office were to take over the telegraph company, the railway company would, or so they claimed, have the additional expense of running their own telegraph.  This difficulty came as a great surprise to the new Chancellor, [[George Ward Hunt]].<ref>Kieve, p. 139</ref>  The problem for the Post Office was that they could not take over on the same terms as private companies, effectively becoming servants of the railway companies.  They wanted the lines, but not the terms that came with them.<ref>Kieve, p. 140</ref>\n\nThe government was determined to reach a decision quickly so that future planning was not left in limbo, and rising company share prices meant that delay would likely add to the costs.  In June, the companies started to negotiate, fearing that if they did not, a disadvantageous arrangement would be imposed on them.  A [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|select committee]] under Hunt reached deals with the telegraph companies based on the last twenty years [[Net income|net profits]], and compensation for the railway companies.  By July, opposition had largely disappeared.<ref>Kieve, pp. 147\u2013149</ref>  It was not originally planned to nationalise the UPTC because they had no lines for general public use; all its lines were private wires in which the Post Office had no interest.  However, the UPTC complained that the planned Post Office uniform rate would so damage their business that they would become unprofitable.  This persuaded Hunt that private wires should be nationalised as well.  Another problem area was the cables to continental Europe.  The Magnetic was obliged to send all continental traffic through STC's cables.  The ETC was obliged to use Reuter's [[Nordeney]] cable.  It would be impossible for a unified nationalised organisation to simultaneously meet both contractual obligations.  To solve this, the government purchased Reuter's cables and leased them back to the STC, together with other continental cables acquired by the Post Office.  This was done in a great hurry and afterwards admitted to be not ideal.  Reuters and STC were to remain un-nationalised.  The bill was passed into law as the [[Telegraph Act 1868]], to take effect July 1869.<ref>Kieve, pp. 148\u2013151</ref>\n\nThe government did not immediately authorise expenditure under the Act.  They had become concerned that entrepreneurs who had been bought out would set up in business again undercutting the Post Office flat rate of one shilling (5p) in lucrative city areas (sixpence (2.5p) had been charged in London by the District) with no obligation to serve unremunerative outlying areas.  Consequently, nationalisation was delayed until The Telegraph Act of 1869 was passed.  This amended the 1868 Act to create a Post Office monopoly,<ref>Kieve, pp. 159\u2013160</ref> with the actual transfer taking effect on 1 January 1870.<ref>Kieve, p. 176</ref>  Companies operating submarine cables with no landlines were excluded from nationalisation.<ref>Hills, p. 26</ref>   Any company that had not, so far, been taken over by the Post Office could demand this happen under the Act for the same 20-year net profit basis as before.  Several small companies that the Post Office considered virtually defunct and not worth buying took advantage of this.<ref>Kieve, p. 159</ref>  The [[Telegraph Act 1870|Telegraph Acts Extension Act 1870]] extended the monopoly to the [[Channel Islands]] and the [[Isle of Man]] resulting in the purchase of the [[Jersey and Guernsey Telegraph Company]] and the [[Isle of Man Electric Telegraph Company]].  The Orkneys & Shetland Telegraph Company was purchased in 1876\u201377 and the Scilly Islands Telegraph Company in 1879\u201380.<ref>Kieve, p. 160</ref>  The STC was finally nationalised in 1890, bringing their international submarine cables and cable ships under Post Office control.<ref>Haigh, p. 193</ref>\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nThere was some criticism of the government handling of the nationalisation.  The total price paid for nationalising the telegraph was \u00a35.9 million, compared to Scudamore's original estimate of \u00a32.5 million.<ref>Kieve, p. 161</ref>  By 1876, the total cost of acquisitions and extensions exceeded \u00a310 million.<ref>Kieve, p. 175</ref>  The price paid for most of the telegraph companies far exceeded their capital value due to the 20-year profit calculation.<ref>Kieve, p. 169</ref>  In comparison, the cost of the telegraph across the whole of continental Europe was only \u00a34 million.<ref>Kieve, p. 166</ref>  It was alleged in parliament, somewhat speculatively, that a new UK telegraph system could have been built from scratch for \u00a32 million.<ref>Kieve, p. 166 citing,<br />''Hansard'', 21 July 1869, p. 250</ref>   The discrepancy was largely due to the unbudgeted payments to the railways, but compounded by paying them on the basis of 20 years net profit.  Most of the railway leases had far less than 20 years to run so the Post Office was not going to get 20 years profit from the purchase.  However, it was difficult to avoid once the principle had been established; Reuters went to arbitration over the issue when the government offered them a lesser deal and won.<ref>Kieve, pp. 164\u2013165</ref>\n\nFurther criticism concerned the purchase of the reversionary rights of the railway wayleaves, which had been another unforeseen expense.  Without these purchases, when the lease expired, the railway company would then have the right to use the line for public telegraphy on its own account unless a new lease was taken out.  Another issue concerned the railways free use of the telegraph on their property.  This was part of the leasing arrangement with the private companies and was inherited by the Post Office.  In most cases, the railway company was also entitled to send free messages to stations not on its own line.  The purpose of this facility was supposed to be for the control of trains, but it was heavily abused; in 1891 1.6 million free messages were sent, compared to 97,000 in 1871.<ref>Kieve, pp. 171\u2013172, 191</ref>  The contractual arrangements with the railway companies were so complex that arbitration cases concerning them were still being heard ten years after nationalisation.<ref>Kieve, p. 174</ref>\n\n== Post Office Telegraphs ==\nPost Office Telegraphs, the branch of the Post Office running the telegraph network, placed their head office in Telegraph Street in the old ETC building.<ref>Kieve, p. 190</ref>  \"The ever open door\" was their slogan above the entrance.<ref>Hamer, p. 75</ref>  Immediately after nationalisation, they set about extending the telegraph from outlying railway stations to town centres.  It was their policy to provide telegraph facilities at every office from which [[money order]]s could be sent, a great increase on the existing number.  For instance, the number of telegraph offices in London increased from 95 in 1869 to 334 in 1870.  By the end of 1870, over 90% of telegrams were sent from post offices.<ref>Kieve, p. 177</ref>  By 1872, the Post Office had 5,000 offices and traffic had increased 50% over pre-nationalisation, to some 12 million messages per year.<ref>Kieve, p. 178</ref>  More offices meant installing more lines, plus the lines handed over to the railways for operating their own internal telegraphs had to be replaced.<ref>Kieve, p. 176</ref>  In 1872 there was 22,000 miles of line, 83,000 miles of wire, and over 6.000 instruments.<ref>Kieve, p. 178</ref>  By 1875, the Telegraph Street central office was the largest telegraph centre in the world with 450 instruments on three floors working connections both domestically in the UK and worldwide on the Imperial telegraph network.<ref>Huurdeman, pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n[[File:Hugh Childers, Lock & Whitfield woodburytype, 1876-83 crop.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=photo|Hugh Childers, 1878]]\nThe Post Office decided to standardise on the Morse telegraph system,<ref>Kieve, p. 176</ref> which had been the international standard since 1865.<ref>Orji, p. 57</ref>  A great variety of different equipments had been used by the companies.  The largest company, ETC, used the Cooke and Wheatstone needle telegraph.  It is possible to send [[Morse code]] on a needle telegraph system but this is slower than using Morse sounders.<ref>Moran, p. 201</ref>  This standardisation could not be immediately implemented everywhere, not least because the [[Franco-Prussian War]] prevented imports of German-made instruments.<ref>Kieve, p. 178</ref>  Some needle telegraphs continued in use, mostly on the railways, well in to the 20th century.<ref>Huurdeman, pp. 67\u201369</ref>\n\nIn 1873 Scudamore left the Post Office under a cloud.  He had been taking money out of other Post Office budgets to pay for the unforeseen costs of telegraph expansion, anticipating that Parliament would soon approve more money.  He went to Turkey where he was employed to modernise the post and telegraph of the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>Kieve, p. 180</ref>  The losses of Post Office Telegraphs steadily grew till 1914.  Interest on the capital overspend was not the only problem.  Although Scudamore's estimate of the increase in traffic from expansion proved largely accurate, the operating costs were badly underestimated.  As a result, net revenue was not sufficient to cover the interest on loans and year on year the debt was growing.<ref>Kieve, pp. 180\u2013183</ref>  On the other hand, the Post Office overall remained profitable throughout the period.<ref>Kieve, p. 247</ref>\n\nThe government attempted to stop the rot with a change in policy in 1873.  No longer was it policy to open a telegraph facility at every office issuing money orders in outlying areas.  It would now have to be shown first that the office was likely to be profitable.  There was no proposal to disconnect already connected unprofitable offices.  However, the number of these declined with increasing traffic.<ref>Kieve, pp. 185\u2013186</ref>  The situation was not helped when in 1883, against the wishes of the government and the Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Hugh Childers]], parliament, under pressure from business groups, called for the minimum charge on inland telegrams to be reduced to sixpence (2.5p).<ref>Kieve, p. 193</ref>  In 1885 Postmaster General [[George Shaw-Lefevre, 1st Baron Eversley|George Shaw-Lefevre]] introduced a bill to implement the sixpence rate, which was passed into law.  Shaw-Lefevre tried to mitigate the adverse effects by limiting sixpence telegrams to only 12 words, including the address.  Addresses had previously been free, but would now be charged for on all telegrams.  \u00a3500,000 was spent on new wires and training additional staff in anticipation of the increased traffic.  Traffic did indeed increase enormously, from 33 million messages in 1884\u201385 to 50 million in 1886\u201387 and reaching its peak by 1900 at over 90 million.  At the same time, there was a large increase in the deficit, mainly due to the cost of the increased staff.<ref>Kieve, pp. 193\u2013195</ref>  Despite the losses, the telegraph was retained in national ownership as it was considered a public service.<ref>Kieve, p. 195</ref>\n\n=== Unionisation ===\nIn 1871 the Telegraphers' Association was formed amongst the telegraph clerks in Manchester with the aim of agitating for higher wages.  This was the first active union in the public service.  Scudamore demanded that the clerks resign from the association and then dismissed those that refused.  There followed a strike to demand their reinstatement.  Scudamore blocked the telegraphic transmission of news of the strike to national newspapers.  The resulting protests from the press got him officially censured.  Wages were increased in 1872 and a formal staff structure introduced.  Their pay was still less than the pay in cable and maintenance companies, resulting in more than 2,300 out of 6,000 clerks leaving the Post Office between 1872 and 1880.<ref>Kieve, p. 187</ref>\n\nIn 1868 [[Charles Monk]] introduced a [[private member's bill]] to parliament that extended the vote to Post Office workers and other civil servants.  It became law despite opposition from the [[Benjamin Disraeli]] government and lack of support from Gladstone, the leader of the opposition.  There was concern that organised workers could have undue influence on Members of Parliament, but this fear never materialised.<ref>Kieve, p. 246</ref>\n\n=== Exchange Telegraph Company ===\nThe [[Exchange Telegraph Company]] (later known as Extel) was, like Reuters, a news distribution service.  It was founded in 1862, but was a very minor player until 1872 when the Post Office granted it a license to provide London Stock Exchange prices and other financial news to its customers in London.  Their license limited their operation to within 900 yards of the stock exchange.  Similar licenses were later granted for local stock exchanges in Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Dublin.  These were all linked to a central office from where news could be distributed.  Extel also provided a service for calling the police, or raising a fire alarm.<ref>Beauchamp, pp. 80\u201381</ref>\n\n== Competition from the telephone ==\n[[File:William Henry Preece - Page's Magazine.png|thumb|upright|alt=photo|William Preece, 1904]]\nUsage of the telegraph never developed to the extent predicted by Scudamore.  Despite the introduction of the sixpence (2.5p) rate, it was still too expensive to compete on price with the letter post and, from its introduction at the end of the 19th century, the [[telephone]].<ref>Kieve, p. 196</ref>  Telephones were first introduced to Britain when William Preece exhibited a pair he had brought from America in 1877.<ref>Day & McNeil, p. 998</ref>  In 1878 the Post Office entered into an agreement with [[Bell Telephone Company]] for the supply of telephones.  It was initially only intended that telephone instruments would be hired out as alternatives to the Wheatstone ABC telegraph on private wires.<ref>Kieve, p. 199</ref>\n\nThere then followed the founding of a string of private telephone companies; the Telephone Company had the rights to [[Alexander Graham Bell]]'s patent and the Edison Telephone Company had the rival patents of [[Thomas Edison]].  These two later merged, forming the United Telephone Company (UTC).  Additionally, a number of companies were founded to set up [[telephone exchange]]s, starting with the Lancashire Telephone Exchange Company in Manchester in 1879.  Telephones on private wires were not a threat, but if exchanges were allowed to connect people over more than a very limited distance, or even worse, connect between exchanges nationally, serious damage could be done to the telegraph business.<ref>Kieve, p. 199-200</ref>  Parliament had declined to give the Post Office a monopoly of telephones.  However, telephone ''messages'', the Post Office argued, counted as telegraph messages under the Telegraph Act 1869, so telephone exchanges could not be set up by private companies without a license from the Post Office.<ref>Kieve, p. 201</ref>\n\nThe Post Office announced that they would issue licenses similar to the license granted to Extel in 1872, with a limit of half a mile to the distance an exchange could connect.  The companies challenged the Post Office monopoly in court, but lost the case in 1880.<ref>{{multiref|Kieve, pp. 201\u2013202|Ball & Sunderland, p. 286|Thomas, p. 126}}</ref>  The same year, a new Postmaster General, [[Henry Fawcett]], started setting up telephone exchanges on the Post Office's own account by modifying the ABC telegraph private wire network, and using telephones made by the [[Gower Bell Telephone Company]].<ref>Kieve, pp. 203\u2013204</ref>  The telephone companies launched an appeal against the court decision.  The UTC, which held all the telephone instrument patents, further claimed that Gower-Bell, by selling to the Post Office, were in breach of their license which forbade them to set up their own exchanges.  However, an agreement was reached before it came to court.  The companies were given licenses on more liberal terms and in exchange they dropped their appeal and recognised the Post Office monopoly.<ref>Kieve, pp. 204\u2013205</ref>\n\nThe Post Office now accepted that the telegraph service was going to decline.  Financially, they were in a better position as the telephone business was very lucrative for them.  Not only was there a fixed charge for the licenses, but the Post Office also took 10% of company gross receipts as a [[royalty payment]].  The cost to the Post Office of maintaining the telephone system was insignificant compared to the cost of the telegram system.   The Post Office was careful not to allow the companies to grow into a national system.  They refused the companies permission to install trunk lines in 1881, preferring to provide them themselves and rent to the companies.  Licenses were limited to one year so that only the Post Office had long term control.<ref>Kieve, pp. 205\u2013207</ref>  In response to complaints that the Post Office was hindering the development of the telephone in the UK, Fawcett, in 1884, allowed the companies to build trunk lines.  Nevertheless, telephone development in the UK still lagged behind other countries.<ref>Kieve, pp. 210\u2013211</ref>\n\nIn 1889, the three main companies, UTC, the National Telephone Company, and the Lancashire & Cheshire Telephone Company amalgamated as the [[National Telephone Company]] (NTC).<ref>Kieve, pp. 211\u2013212</ref>  In 1891 the NTC patents ran out and nationalisation was mooted but the Post Office was not ready to do so.<ref>Kieve, p. 213</ref>  The NTC was accused of inefficiency, high prices, and, especially in London, of disfiguring the landscape with haphazard overhead wires.<ref>Kieve, p. 212\u2013213</ref>  When the NTC's license expired in 1911 they were nationalised under the Post Office.<ref>Kieve, p. 214</ref>  After 1911, telegraph usage declined rapidly.<ref>Kieve, p. 236</ref>  At the same time, telephone use grew, especially after 1960; by 1970 there were nearly 14 million telephones in the UK, nearly double the 1960 figure.<ref>Kieve, p. 266</ref>\n\n== Specialist uses ==\n=== Railway block signalling ===\n{{main|Signalling block system}}\nFrom the beginning, Cooke promoted the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph to the railways as a safer way of working, particularly on [[single-line working|single lines]], with the first installations in the 1840s.  Previously, separation of trains had relied on strict timetabling.  [[Absolute block signalling|Block working]], controlled by the telegraph, ensured that only one train at a time could be on a section of line.<ref>Kieve, pp. 33\u201334</ref>  The benefits of block working were not generally appreciated until the late 1860s.  The number of block instruments on the [[London and North Western Railway]], for instance, increased from 311 in 1869 to 3,000 in 1879.<ref>Kieve, p. 239</ref>\n\n=== News service ===\n[[File:Lord Rothermere.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=photo|Lord Rothermere, 1914]]\nPrior to [[World War I]], the telegraph rates charged to news services became a political issue.  There was an extremely preferential rate granted for news providers.  They were charged one shilling (5p) for 75 or 100 words (depending whether it was inside or out of office hours respectively) and then twopence (0.4p) for each additional 75/100 words, including repeat messages to different addresses.  Thus, a journalist could send 100 messages and 99 of them would cost only twopence.  This was not profitable for the Post Office, but the government was reluctant to act because they did not want to antagonise the newspapers.<ref>Kieve, pp. 216\u2013217</ref>  The issue was put on hold when war broke out, but in 1915 the minimum price of ordinary inland telegrams was raised from sixpence (2.5p) to ninepence (3.8p).  The Postmaster General, [[Herbert Samuel]], commented \"If 6d for 12 words is unremunerative, 1s for 100 words is far more so\", let alone the twopence copy rate for subsequent messages.<ref>Kieve, p. 223</ref>  Samuel proposed a new press scale of 1s for 60/80 words and a copy rate of threepence (1.3p).<ref>Kieve, pp. 223, 290</ref>  This was first delayed to 1917 because of the war, and then to 1920 when it was finally implemented.<ref>Kieve, pp. 223\u2013224</ref>\n\nSome London newspaper proprietors, notably [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]], proprietor of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and cofounder of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', supported increased charges, which would tend to discourage new rivals.  In 1926 Rothermere tried to persuade the Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[Winston Churchill]], but the Postmaster General, [[William Mitchell-Thomson, 1st Baron Selsdon|William Mitchell-Thomson]] was against charging an economic rate.  Provincial papers would stop using the telegraph, or be driven out of business altogether, with little saving to the Post Office.  The fixed costs of maintaining and operating the telegraph system would still have to be paid.<ref>Kieve, pp. 225\u2013226</ref>  The press rate was not increased until 1940 when it went up to one shilling and threepence (6.3p) when there was a general increase in all charges.  The copy rate remained at threepence until 1955 when it was abolished.  By that time, with increasing use of the telephone, income from press telegrams had become insignificant.<ref>Kieve, p. 228</ref>\n\n=== Military ===\nThe first military use of the telegraph in action was during the [[Crimean War]] (1853\u20131856).  A submarine cable was laid across the [[Black Sea]] from [[Varna]] to [[Balaklava]].<ref>Kieve, p. 239</ref>  The army found the use of civilian volunteer telegraphists problematic because of their lack of military training.  From 1870, the [[War Office]] arranged with the Post Office for the training of military telegraphists.  [[Royal Engineers]] from the [[Telegraph Battalion]] were employed on state telegraphs and withdrawn for overseas duties in time of war.<ref>Kieve, pp. 240\u2013241</ref>\n\nIn World War I, the telegraph was recognised as being of crucial importance.  Both sides tried to damage the international telegraph lines of the other.  Post Office cable ships were involved in the action.<ref>Kieve, p. 241</ref>  Just a few hours after the declaration of war on 4 August 1914, [[CS Alert (1890)|CS ''Alert'']] cut the German cables in the English Channel, almost completely isolating Germany from the rest of the world.<ref>Corera, Prologue</ref>  In 1915, [[CS Monarch (1883)|CS ''Monarch'']] was sunk by a German mine off Folkestone.<ref>Haigh, pp. 204\u2013205</ref>\n\n=== Meteorology ===\nThe science of [[meteorology]] was greatly assisted by the rapid weather reports made possible by the telegraph.  In 1860 the Magnetic was contracted by the [[Board of Trade]] to pass weather data between London and Paris.  [[Lighthouse]]s, [[Lightvessel|lightships]], and islands got telegraph connections and became weather stations.  There were even attempts to place [[weather ship]]s far out into the Atlantic.  The first attempt was in 1870 with the old Corvette ''The Brick'' 50 miles off [[Lands End]].  \u00a315,000 was spent on the project, but ultimately it failed.  In 1881, there was a proposal for a weather ship in the mid-Atlantic, but it came to nothing.<ref>Kieve, p. 241</ref>  Deep-ocean weather ships had to await the commencement of [[radio telegraphy]].<ref>Kieve, p. 242\u2013243</ref>\n\n=== Emergency services ===\nThe provision of telegraph connections to lightships gave a means of calling for assistance to a ship in difficulties.  Prior to having a telegraph connection, there had been cases of ships wrecked on rocks after being seen to be struggling by a lightship for as long as twelve hours.  For instance, the [[SS Agnes Jack|SS ''Agnes Jack'']] sunk with the loss of all hands in January 1883 in view of a lightship off the coast of Wales.<ref>Kieve, p. 241</ref>\n\nInstallation of street [[Manual fire alarm activation|call points]] to raise a fire alarm by electric telegraph had been installed in Europe as early as 1849 in Berlin.  [[Siemens Brothers]] had proposed a system in Manchester using the now ubiquitous [[break glass]] call points around 1861.  The town council rejected the scheme through fear of hooliganism.  The first system was not installed in Britain until the [[Metropolitan Fire Brigade (London)|Metropolitan Fire Brigade]] in London took it up in 1880, installing 40 call points.  Other towns soon followed and there was a dramatic reduction in serious fires as a result.<ref>Kieve, p. 245</ref>\n\nThe police were an early user of telegraph private wires.  In 1850 [[Scotland Yard]] had a line to [[Charing Cross railway station]].  In 1860 the police stations of the [[City of London]] were connected together using the Wheatstone ABC system.  Church steeples were used to keep the wires high and out of reach of vandals and criminals.  In 1872\u201373 the [[Metropolitan Police]] connected numerous points in their district to police stations.<ref>Kieve, p. 245</ref>\n\n=== Commercial codebooks ===\n{{main|Commercial code (communications)}}\nTelegraph [[codebook]]s consist of a large number of short [[codeword]]s which decode to a whole phrase or sentence.  These were important in the UK, and elsewhere.  They were used by businesses which sent a large number of telegrams.  The idea was to reduce the word count of the message, thus holding down the cost of the message.  This was of particular importance for international traffic which was sent over long, expensive submarine cables.<ref>Kahn, p. 838</ref>  This was much more effective than the common practise of [[telegram style]] \u2013 heavily abbreviated messaging using the minimum number of words.<ref>Wenzlhuemer, p. 247</ref>  In some cases, telegraph codes also served the purpose of maintaining secrecy for commercially sensitive information; companies would develop their own private code.<ref>Godfrey, p. 29</ref>\n\nMany commercial codebooks were published in the UK.  Popular titles included ''The ABC Universal Commercial Electric Telegraphic Code'', first published 1873,<ref>{{multiref|Clauson-Thue (1873)|>Wenzlhuemer, p. 247}}</ref> and ''Bentley's Complete Phrase Code'', first published 1906.<ref>{{multiref|Bentley (1906)|Kahn, pp. 843\u2013844}}</ref>  The ''ABC Code'' was written by [[William Clausen-Thue]], a shipping manager, later to become a Fellow of the [[Royal Geographical Society]].  His codebook was the first public code to be widely sold.<ref>Kahn, p. 838</ref>  Many codebooks were written for a specific trade or industry.<ref>{{multiref|Godfrey, p. 30|Kahn, p. 844}}</ref>  ''Bentley's'', for instance, published a supplement especially for mining.<ref>Bentley (1907)</ref>\n\n''Bentley's'' was written by [[Ernest Lungley Bentley]] and may have been the most widely used codebook worldwide.  It had sold 100,000 copies by 1967.  In 1905, Bentley was working for a shipping agency on the company's private code.  He left to found his own company and develop a code for general use.  He used codewords from ''Whitelaw's Telegraph Cyphers'',<ref>Whitelaw (1904)</ref> published in London in 1904, which contained 20,000 pronounceable five-letter words.  ''Whitelaw's'' could be used to generate 400 million codewords by running any two five-letter words together to make a still pronouncable ten-letter word.  Pronouncability was important because only pronouncable codewords were allowed by the telegraph authorities.  ''Whitelaw's'' was purely a list of codewords; no meanings were assigned to them.  ''Bentley's'' was the first codebook of such five-letter codewords.<ref>Kahn, p. 843</ref>\n\nStarting in 1896,<ref>Godfrey</ref> the [[International Telegraph Union]] (ITU) attempted to control the use of codes in international telegrams to protect telegraph incomes and avoid messages that were difficult for operators to transmit.  In 1875 they reduced the maximum length of a word (telegrams were charged by the word) from seven syllables to ten letters.  In 1879, at a conference in London, they decided that all words used must come from one of eight named languages.  Codes using invented words could then be charged as a [[cipher]] message at a much higher rate.<ref>Kahn, p. 842</ref>  The attempt was not successful.  The rules were abused in the UK and Europe and incoming messages from the US (which was not an ITU member) entirely ignored them.<ref>Kahn, p. 842</ref>  In 1890, in an attempt to stop the abuse, the ITU published a list of a quarter of a million authorised codewords.  There was strong opposition to this as many existing codes would not be allowed under this scheme.  In 1896, they allowed any code provided it was first submitted for approval and the words added to the official dictionary.  By 1901 this had expanded to well over a million words.  The task of maintaining the list had become too difficult and in 1903 the requirement became that words had merely to be \"pronounceable\".  The publication of Whitelaw's 400 million codewords permanently killed the idea of an official list.<ref>Kahn, p. 843</ref>\n\n== Automation ==\n[[File:Lochstreifen-2.png|thumb|left|alt=photo|Punched paper tape as used for Baudot-Murray code messages, c. 1976]]\nOn busy lines, [[multiplexing]] was used to avoid the cost of erecting additional wires.  The Post Office used a system that could simultaneously send four messages in each direction (eight simultaneous messages in all).  These systems were usually used in conjunction with high speed paper [[punched tape]] readers to maximise the usage of the line.  Messages were first typed on to punched tape before sending to the line.  The code used was the [[Baudot code]], invented by [[\u00c9mile Baudot]].  Early keyboards used were Baudot's five-key \"piano\" keyboards (each key corresponding to one of the [[bit]]s of the code, and hence to one hole in each column of holes on the tape). Later keyboards were typewriter-like and used [[Baudot code#Murray code|Murray's 1901 modification]] of the Baudot code.<ref>Kieve, pp. 249\u2013250</ref>\n[[File:Mr W A J Dearn, a motorcycle messenger attached to Wood Green Post Office, 1941. D5245.jpg|thumb|alt=photo|Motorcycle telegraph messenger from [[Wood Green]] Post Office, 1941]]\nThe [[teleprinter]] was invented in the United States in 1915, but was not taken up by the Post Office until 1922, after a British company, [[Creed & Company]], started producing a similar machine in 1921.  From then on, teleprinters started to replace the Morse system,<ref>Kieve, p. 249</ref> and Morse was completely eliminated from Post Office landlines and submarine lines in 1932, but continued in use in [[radiotelegraphy]].<ref>Huurdeman, p. 142</ref>  A teleprinter has a typewriter-like keyboard for sending messages, which are automatically printed at both the sending and receiving end.  The system had great cost savings for the Post Office.  The operators did not need to be trained in Morse and the receiving operator did not need to be attending the machine during receipt of the message.  It was only necessary to fix the printed message to the telegram form for delivery.  Thus, one operator could work several telegraph lines simultaneously.<ref>Kieve, p. 249</ref>\n\nBecause traffic was declining in the 1920s, it was not worthwhile to automate many less busy lines.  Wherever possible, the Post Office closed direct lines and diverted traffic on to the main automated lines by a more circuitous route.  About eighty such circuits were closed.<ref>Kieve, p. 250</ref>  Between 1929 and 1935, on the recommendation of a committee set up by Postmaster General [[William Mitchell-Thomson, 1st Baron Selsdon|William Mitchell-Thomson]] in 1927,<ref>Kieve, p. 250</ref> the old Morse and Baudot equipments were replaced with Creed teleprinters without waiting for the apparatus to reach end of life.  The War Office expressed concern at this change; they would no longer have a pool of trained Morse operators to call upon.  Another innovation in this period was the use of motorcycle messengers to speed up delivery.<ref>Kieve, pp. 255\u2013256</ref>\n\nAutomation, closing uneconomic lines, and staff rationalisation reduced, but did not eliminate, the deficit on the telegraph service.  Between 1930 and 1934 the deficit fell from over \u00a31 million to \u00a3650,000.<ref>Kieve, p. 256</ref>  Towards the end of the 1930s, teleprinter automatic switching in exchanges was introduced, eliminating the need for manual exchange operators.  The possibility of direct dialling between customers' teleprinters was investigated in 1939,<ref>Kieve, p. 260</ref> but nothing was done until after [[World War II]].<ref>Huurdeman, p. 510</ref>\n\n== Decline and recovery ==\n[[File:Female telegraph messenger (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|alt=photo|Female telegram messenger during World War I]]\nThe pre-war decline was briefly halted during World War I, but usage started falling again in 1920 when the minimum charge for inland telegrams doubled to one shilling (5p).  By 1935, with the country in the grip of [[Great Depression|economic depression]], inland telegram messages had fallen to 35 million, less than half the pre-war figure, and just over one third of the 1900 peak.<ref>Kieve, pp. 248, 195</ref>  At the same time, telephone usage rapidly increased as the number of subscribers grew.  Telephone calls grew from 716 million in 1919 to over 2.2 billion in 1939.  Even the number of telephone trunk calls alone, 112 million in 1939, exceeded the number of telegrams.<ref>Kieve, p. 248</ref>  In some cases telegrams were sent or received by telephone (phonograms), making it increasingly difficult to treat the two services separately.<ref>Kieve, pp. 256\u2013257</ref>  By 1939, 40% of telegrams were phonograms.<ref>Kieve, p. 259</ref>\n\nAnother issue that encouraged decline was the introduction in 1921 of telegram delivery by \"walks\" similar to the way mail was delivered.  That is, a group of telegrams were all delivered by one messenger on the same outing over a predefined route.  Previously, a messenger was sent out from the receiving office as soon as the telegram was received.  This eroded the speed advantage of the telegraph over the post, although the time between walks was still usually very short; the postal service was cheaper and could guarantee next-day delivery almost anywhere in the British Isles, which for most purposes was good enough.  Around 800 fewer messengers were required as a result of the introduction of this system.<ref>Kieve, pp. 248, 250</ref>\n\nIn 1935 Postmaster General [[Kingsley Wood]] took steps to increase the usage of the telegraph service.  The sixpence (2.5p) rate was restored, but for only nine words.  A priority service was introduced for an additional sixpence, delivered in a red envelope.  Special envelopes were also introduced for greetings telegrams, coloured gold with a red and blue border, and a dove logo.  This service was heavily publicised to overcome a widespread belief that telegrams usually meant bad news.  The message was hand written rather than printed tape, and the Post Office provided a free diary service for recurring events like birthdays and anniversaries.  In 1939, over 4 million greetings telegrams were delivered and the total number of telegrams got back up to 50 million.<ref>Kieve, pp. 257\u2013259</ref>  Another service introduced around this time was [[facsimile]] by telegraphy (fax).  This was heavily used by newspapers to receive photographs.<ref>Kieve, p. 260</ref>\n\n== World War II ==\n[[File:The Telephone Service Carries On, London, January 1942 D6422.jpg|thumb|alt=photo|Telegraph messengers collecting telephone messages for bombed-out telephone subscribers at an emergency telephone bureau, 1942]]\n[[World War II]] saw an increase in telegraph traffic.  Usage peaked in 1945 with 63 million messages.  [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|Children evacuated overseas]] were given one free telegram per month to stay in touch with their parents.<ref>Kieve, p. 260</ref>  Telegraph operators trained in Morse were considered important enough to make them a [[reserved occupation]].<ref>Kieve, p. 261</ref>\n\nEnemy action caused disruption to the British telegraph system both domestically and in the imperial network worldwide, but communication was largely maintained.  The Central Telegraph Office in Telegraph Street was destroyed in a bombing raid in December 1940.<ref>Hamer, p. 75</ref>  Service was maintained by emergency centres in London set up to cover just such an eventuality.  The financial centre in the [[City of London]] was important enough that messengers were stationed in the street in 1941 to collect telegrams.<ref>Kieve, p. 261</ref>  Italy entered the war on the [[Axis powers|Axis]] side in June 1940 immediately after the [[Fall of France]] to the Germans.  The Italian navy then cut the five British telegraph cables from [[Gibraltar]] to [[Malta]] and two of the five going on from Malta to [[Alexandria]].  This was the most direct route of communication with the British forces in [[Egypt]] and East Africa.  The resistance of the British Egyptian forces to [[Erwin Rommel]]'s [[Afrika Korps]] played an important part in winning the war, and it was vital to maintain a telegraph connection.  Malta was important too because of the threat it posed to Rommel's [[line of communication]].  The telegraph system was resilient enough to do this, but only by a very roundabout route going all round the continent of Africa on submarine cables.<ref>{{multiref|Stephenson, p. 50|Kieve, p. 261}}</ref>\n\n== End of the telegraph era ==\n=== Telegrams ===\nAfter the war, telegram usage went back into decline and the deficit returned into the millions of pounds.  Telegram numbers were 42 million in 1950, under 14 million in 1960, and only 7.7 million in 1970, the lowest it had ever been under nationalisation.<ref>Kieve, pp. 261\u2013262</ref>  Repeated price rises by successive Postmasters General [[Ness Edwards]] and [[Ernest Marples]] to try to keep the deficit under control only made the situation worse by driving traffic down even further.<ref>Kieve, pp. 262\u2013263</ref>  Other measures were the ending or reduction of special prices for certain categories.  These included the end of free messages for the railways in 1967, increase of the press rate, and increase of the surcharge for telegrams to the [[Republic of Ireland]], which had not been part of the United Kingdom since 1922, and officially a republic since 1949.<ref>Kieve, pp. 262\u2013264</ref>\n[[File:Rex Whistler - St Valentines Day Greetings Telegram 1935.jpg|thumb|alt=facsimile|Valentine's Day greeting telegram by [[Rex Whistler]], 1935]]\nOne area that continued to grow was greetings telegrams.  More special occasion categories were added and premium \"de luxe\" telegrams were introduced for some categories in 1961.<ref>Kieve, p. 265</ref>  Business use of public telegrams, once the major user of the service, was now minimal.<ref>Kieve, p. 263</ref>  A greeting telegram unique to the UK was the practise of the monarch sending a message to citizens reaching their hundredth birhtday.  This was instituted by [[George V]] in 1917, and in the 1940s a special telegram bearing a [[Royal Crest]] was introduced.  There were only 24 recipients in 1917, rising to 255 in 1952 and by 2015, over 8,000 messages were sent, but no longer by telegram as the service had been discontinued.<ref>{{multiref|Williams, pt. 1|Seward, p. 256}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969 [[Post Office Telecommunications]], of which the telegraph service formed a part, was made a distinct department of the Post Office,<ref>Pitt, p. 154</ref> and in 1981 it was separated entirely from the Post Office as [[British Telecom]] as a first step to its privatisation in 1984.<ref>Welch & Fr\u00e9mond, p. 16</ref>  British Telecom ended their inland telegram service in 1982.  International telegrams were still handled, of which there were 13.7 million in 1970.<ref>Kieve, p. 266</ref>  However, incoming international telegrams were no longer delivered by messenger, they were instead delivered by ordinary post.<ref>Hamer, p. 75</ref>\n\nThe telegram service was replaced with the ''telemessage'' service in which the message is dictated over the phone to an operator and delivered by post in a yellow envelope similar to the old telegram envelope.  British Telecom discontinued this service in 2003 and sold the business to Telegrams Online.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/connecting-britain/edward-prince-wales-visits-londons-telegram-boys/ \"Edward Prince of Wales visits London's telegram boys\"], ''The Telegraph'', 9 June 2017, [https://web.archive.org/web/20190304162409/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/connecting-britain/edward-prince-wales-visits-londons-telegram-boys/ archived] 4 March 2019.</ref>\n\n=== Telex and private wires ===\nAt the end of WWII, the Post Office restarted their move to automatic switching which had been put on hold for the duration.  Automatic switching was established in 1947 and sowed the seed of the international [[telex]] network that developed from 1970 onwards.  Telex, standing for \"telegraphy exchange\", was a switched network of teleprinters using automatic exchanges.  It was originally a trademark of [[Western Union]] who set up a telex system in the United States in 1962, but soon became a generic name for the worldwide network.  The advantages of telex over telephone were that an operator was not required to permanently staff the station to receive messages, and that a printed message provided a permanent record.<ref>Huurdeman, pp. 510\u2013511</ref>  While the telegram service was declining post-war, in the same period business use of telegraph private wires and telex was growing.<ref>Kieve, p. 263</ref>  Most press traffic was also now on telex or private wires so the increase in the press rate on the public telegram system was of little concern to them.<ref>Kieve, p. 264</ref>  The British military also used telex to link military installations through the [[Cold War]] period.  Their Telegraph Automatic Switching System was used from 1955 until well into the 1980s.<ref>Lord & Sterling, p. 449</ref>\n\nAs office computers became commonplace in the 1980s, telex switched to a new telegraph code, [[ASCII]], which aided integration with computers.  ASCII is a 7-bit code, compared to the Baudot 5-bit code, which means it has enough codes to represent both [[letter case|upper and lower case]] whereas Baudot machines printed in upper case only.  Teleprinters could then be used in conjunction with [[word processor]] programs for instance.<ref>Huurdeman, p. 512</ref>  Increased use of [[fax]] machines drove down telex traffic, a change that was precipitated by the postal strikes [[1971 United Kingdom postal workers strike|of 1971]],<ref>Bennett, p. 579</ref> and most especially [[1988 United Kingdom postal workers strike|of 1988]].<ref>Commission of the EC, p. 15</ref>  Telex was mostly superseded by [[e-mail]] and the [[internet]] in the 1990s.  The number of subscribers in the UK fell from 115,000 in 1988 to 18,000 in 1997.<ref>Huurdeman, pp. 512\u2013513</ref>  One of the last groups using the telex service was solicitors, who used it for [[exchange of contracts]] in [[conveyancing]] amongst other things.  Conveyancing can be done by post or telephone, but telex has an immediacy that the former does not, and provides a written record that the latter does not.  Conveyancing can also be done over the internet, but in the 1990s there was some concern over its security.<ref>Walker, p. 492</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|18em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Ash, Stewart, \"The development of submarine cables\", ch. 1 in, Burnett, Douglas R.; Beckman, Robert; Davenport, Tara M., ''Submarine Cables: The Handbook of Law and Policy'', Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 2014 {{ISBN|9789004260320}}.\n* Ball, Michael; Sunderland, David T., ''An Economic History of London, 1800\u20131914'', Routledge, 2001 {{ISBN|9780415246910}}\n* Beauchamp, Ken, ''History of Telegraphy'', Institution of Engineering and Technology, 2001 {{ISBN|9780852967928}}.\n* Bennett, Robert J., ''Local Business Voice: The History of Chambers of Commerce in Britain, Ireland, and Revolutionary America, 1760-2011'', Oxford University Press, 2011 {{ISBN|0199584737}}.\n* Bentley, Ernest L., ''Bentley's Complete Phrase Code'', London: E.

{"title_page": "Agenda-setting theory", "text_new": "{{Essay-like|date=August 2019}}\n\n'''Agenda-setting theory''' describes the \"ability (of the [[news media]]) to influence the importance placed on the topics of the public agenda\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=McCombs|first=M|author2=Reynolds, A|title=News influence on our pictures of the world|journal=Media Effects: Advances in Theory and Research|year=2002}}</ref> Agenda-setting theory was formally developed by Max McCombs and [[Donald Lewis Shaw|Donald Shaw]] in a study on the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 American presidential election]]. Agenda setting is a social science theory; it also attempts to make predictions. The theory also suggests that media has a great influence to their audience by instilling what they should think instead of what they think. That is, if a news item is covered frequently and prominently, the audience will regard the issue as more important.  \n\nAgenda-setting is the creation of public awareness and concern of salient issues by the news media. As well, agenda-setting describes the way that media attempts to influence viewers, and establish a hierarchy of news prevalence. Two basic assumptions underlie most researches on agenda-setting: \n\n# the press and the media do not reflect reality; they filter and shape it;\n# media concentration on a few issues and subjects leads the public to perceive those issues as more important than other issues.\n\nThese core statements were established by measuring the changes in salience through the use of surveys with the presence of more frequent news coverage.<ref name=\"Dearing 1988 555\u2013594\" /><ref name=\"Rogers 1988 555\u2013594\" />\n\nOne of the most critical aspects in the concept of an agenda-setting role of [[mass communication]] is the time frame for this phenomenon. Different media have different agenda-setting potential. From the perspective of agenda setting, the analysis of the relationship between traditional media and new virtual spaces has witnessed growing momentum.<ref>ARUGUETE, N. (2017). The agenda setting hypothesis in the new media environment. Comunicaci\u00f3n Y Sociedad (0188-252X), (28), 35-58.</ref>\n\nIn the 1968 \"Chapel Hill study\", McCombs and [[Donald Lewis Shaw|Shaw]] demonstrated a strong [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation coefficient]] (r > .9) between what 100 residents of [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]] thought was the most important election issue and what the local and national news media reported was the most important issue.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McCombs|first=M|author2=Shaw, D|title=The agenda-setting function of mass media|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1972|volume=36|issue=2|doi=10.1086/267990|pages=176|url=http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/ESMP/article/view/62207}}</ref> By comparing the salience of issues in news content with the public's perceptions of the most important election issue, McCombs and [[Donald Lewis Shaw|Shaw]] were able to determine the degree to which the media determines [[public opinion]]. Since the 1968 study, published in a 1972 edition of ''[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]'', more than 400 studies have been published on the agenda-setting function of the [[mass media]], and the theory continues to be regarded as relevant.\nStudies have shown that what the media decides to expose in certain countries correlates with their views on things such as politics, economy and culture. Countries that tend to have more political power are more likely to receive media exposure. Financial resources, technologies, foreign trade and money spent on the military can be some of the main factors that explain coverage inequality.<ref name=\"McCombs 2005\">{{cite journal|last=McCombs|first=M|title=A look at agenda-setting: Past, present and future.|journal=Journalism Studies|year=2005|volume=6|issue=4|doi=10.1080/14616700500250438|pages=543\u2013557}}</ref>\n\nAgenda-setting can be traced to the first chapter of [[Walter Lippmann]]'s 1922 book, ''[[Public Opinion (book)|Public Opinion]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lippmann|first=W|title=Public opinion|url=https://archive.org/details/publicopinion00lippgoog|year=1922|publisher=Harcourt|location=New York}}</ref>  In that chapter, \"[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/lippman/ch01.html The World Outside And The Pictures In Our Heads]\", Lippmann argues that the mass media are the principal connection between events in the world and the images in the minds of the public. Without using the term \"agenda-setting\", Walter Lippmann was writing about what we today would call \"agenda-setting\". Following Lippmann, in 1963, [[Bernard Cecil Cohen|Bernard Cohen]] observed that the press \"may not be successful much of the time in telling people what to think, but it is stunningly successful in telling its readers what to think about. The world will look different to different people,\" Cohen continues, \"depending on the map that is drawn for them by writers, editors, and publishers of the paper they read.\"<ref name=\"Cohen 1963\">{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=B|title=The press and foreign policy|year=1963|publisher=Harcourt|location=New York}}</ref> As early as the 1960s, Cohen had expressed the idea that later led to formalization of agenda-setting theory by McCombs and Shaw. The stories with the strongest agenda setting influence tend to be those that involve conflict, terrorism, crime and drug issues within the United States. Those that don't include or involve the United State and politics associate negatively with public opinion. In turn, there is less concern.\n\nAlthough Maxwell McCombs already had some interest in the field, he was exposed to Cohen's work while serving as a faculty member at [[UCLA]], and it was Cohen's work that heavily influenced him, and later Donald Shaw.<ref name=\"Rogers 1993 68\u201384\">{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=E|title=The anatomy of agenda-setting research|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1993|volume=43|issue=2|pages=68\u201384|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1993.tb01263.x}}</ref> The concept of agenda setting was launched by McCombs and Shaw during the 1968 presidential election in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. They examined Lippmann's idea of construction of the pictures in our heads by comparing the issues on the media agenda with key issues on the undecided voters' agenda. They found evidence of agenda setting by identifying that salience of the news agenda is highly correlated to that of the voters' agenda. McCombs and Shaw were the first to provide the field of communication with empirical evidence that demonstrated the power of mass media and its influence on the public agenda. The empirical evidence also earned this theory its credibility amongst other social scientific theories.<ref name=\"Rogers 1993 68\u201384\" /><ref name=\"Dearing 1988 555\u2013594\" />\n\nA relatively unknown scholar named G. Ray Funkhouser performed a study highly similar to McCombs and Shaw's around the same time the authors were formalizing the theory.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Funkhouser|first=G|title=The issues of the sixties: An exploratory study in the dynamics of public opinion|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1973|volume=37|issue=1|pages=62\u201375|doi=10.1086/268060}}</ref>  All three scholars \u2013 McCombs, Shaw, and Funkhouser \u2013 even presented their findings at the same academic conference. Funkhouser's article was published later than McCombs and Shaw's, and Funkhouser doesn't receive as much credit as McCombs and Shaw for discovering agenda setting. According to Everett Rogers, there are two main reasons for this.<ref name=\"Rogers 1993 68\u201384\"/> First, Funkhouser didn't formally name the theory. Second, Funkhouser didn't pursue his research much past the initial article. Rogers also suggests that Funkhouser was geographically isolated at [[Stanford]], cut off from interested researchers, whereas McCombs and Shaw had got other people interested in agenda setting research.\n\n==Type==\nThe research on the effect of agenda setting compares the salience of issues in news content with the public perceptions of the most important issue, and then analyses the extent of influence by guidance of the media. There are three models assumed by Max McCombs: the awareness model, the priorities model and the salience model. Most investigations are centered on these three models. In the research, the dependent variables are media agenda, audience agenda and policy agenda as listed in the following part. Rogers and Dearing identify three types of agenda setting:<ref name=\"Rogers 1988 555\u2013594\"/>\n\n#public agenda setting, in which the public's agenda is the [[Dependent and independent variables#Dependent variable|dependent variable]] (the traditional hypothesis)\n#media agenda setting, in which the media's agenda is treated as the dependent variable (\"agenda building\")\n#policy agenda setting, in which elite policy makers' agendas are treated as the dependent variable (\"political agenda setting\")\n\nMass communication research, Rogers and Dearing argue, has focused a great deal on public agenda setting (e.g. McCombs and Shaw, 1972) and media agenda setting, but has largely ignored [[overton window|policy agenda setting]], which is studied primarily by [[political science|political scientists]]. As such, the authors suggest mass communication scholars pay more attention to how the media and public agendas might influence elite policy maker's agendas (i.e. scholars should ask where the President or members of the U.S. Congress get their news from and how this affects their policies). Writing in 2006, Walgrave and Van Aelst took up Rogers and Dearing's suggestions, creating a preliminary theory of political agenda setting, which examines factors that might influence elite policy makers' agendas.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walgrave|first=S|author2=Van Aelst, P|title=The contingency of the mass media's political agenda setting power: Toward a preliminary theory|journal=Journal of Communication|year=2006|volume=56|pages=88\u2013109|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00005.x}}</ref>\n\n==Accessibility==\nAgenda setting occurs through a cognitive process known as \"accessibility\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Iyengar|first=S|title=News that mattes: Television and American opinion|year=1987|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|author2=Kinder, D}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Iyengar|first=S|title=The accessibility bias in politics: Television news and public opinion|journal=International Journal of Public Opinion Research|year=1990|volume=2|pages=1\u201315|doi=10.1093/ijpor/2.1.1}}</ref> Accessibility implies that the more frequently and prominently the news media cover an issue, the more instances of that issue become accessible in audience's memories. When respondents are asked what the most important problem facing the country is, they answer with the most accessible news issue in memory, which is typically the issue the news media focused on the most. The agenda-setting effect is not the result of receiving one or a few messages but is due to the aggregate impact of a very large number of messages, each of which has a different content but all of which deal with the same general issue.<ref name=\"Dearing 1988 555\u2013594\">{{cite journal|last=Dearing|first=J|title=Agenda-setting research: Where has it been, where is it going?|journal=Communication Yearbook|year=1988|volume=11|pages=555\u2013594|author2=Rogers, E}}</ref> \nMass-media coverage in general and agenda-setting in particular also has a powerful impact on what individuals think that other people are thinking,<ref name=\"Dearing 1988 555\u2013594\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Noelle-Neumann|first=E|title=Turbulances in the climate of opinion:Methodological applications of the spiral of silence theory|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1977|volume=41 | issue = 2|pages=143\u2013158|doi = 10.1086/268371 }}</ref> and hence they tend to allocate more importance to issues that have been extensively covered by mass media. This is also called [[Schema (psychology)|schemata theory]]. In psychology and cognitive science, a schema (plural schemata or schemas) describes a pattern of thought or behavior that organizes categories of information and the relationships among them.\n\n==Comparison to agenda-building==\nAs more scholars published articles on agenda-setting theories it became evident that the process involves not only active role of media organizations, but also participation of the public<ref name=\"Erbring 1980 16\u201349\">{{cite journal|last=Erbring|first=L|author2=Goldenberg, E.N.|author3=Miller, A.H.|title=Front-page news and real-world cues: A new look at agenda-setting by the media.|journal=American Journal of Political Science|year=1980|volume=24|issue=1|pages=16\u201349|doi=10.2307/2110923|jstor=2110923}}</ref><ref name=\"Lang 1981 447\u2013468\">{{cite journal |last=Lang|first=G.E.|author2=Lang, K.|title=Watergate: An exploration of the agenda-building process|editor=Wilhout, G.C.| editor2=de Bock, H.|journal=Mass Communication Review Yearbook|year=1981|volume=2|pages=447\u2013468}}</ref> as well as policymakers.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\">{{cite journal|last=Berkowitz|first=D|title=Who sets the media agenda?

The media agenda in fact is the result of the influences that certain powerful groups exert as a subtle form of social control. Journalists have limited time and limited resources that can contribute to external sources getting involved in the news media's gatekeeping process, and some scholars have attempted to reveal certain relationships between information sources and the agenda the news media has made up, probing who builds the media agenda. There are multiple sources that can participate in this agenda-building process through various different ways, but researchers have been the most interested in the effectiveness of information aids such as media kits and press releases within the news media agenda, and this is a measure of the success of organizations public relations efforts.\n\nBerkowitz has implemented a more nuanced analysis of agenda-setting and agenda-building theories by introducing the terms policy agenda-setting and policy agenda-building.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\"/> He argues that when scholars investigate only the linkage between media and policymakers, it is still appropriate to use the notion of policy agenda-setting.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\"/> However, when the focus is placed not only on policymakers' personal agendas, but also on the broader salient issues where media represent only one indicator of public sentiment, Berkowitz suggests talking about policy agenda-building.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\"/>\n\n== Research on policymakers and public ==\n\n=== Role of policymakers in agenda-setting process ===\nSome groups have a greater ease of access than others and are thus more likely to get their demands placed on agenda than others.<ref name=\"Cobb 1971 892\u2013915\">{{cite journal|last=Cobb|first=R.W.|author2=Elder, C.|title=The politics of agenda-building: An alternative perspective for modern democratic theory|journal=Journal of Politics|year=1971|volume=33|issue=4|pages=892\u2013915|doi=10.2307/2128415|jstor=2128415|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e47bf34ab7ec85bfc5e0ace18859a5b015c9f347}}</ref>  For instance, policymakers have been found to be more influential than the overall group of news sources because they often better understand journalists' needs for reliable and predictable information and their definition of newsworthiness.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\"/> Cobb and Elder ascribed even more importance to decision makers, claiming that in order for an issue to attain agenda status, it must be supported by at least some of key decision makers as they act as guardians of the formal agenda.<ref name=\"Cobb 1971 892\u2013915\"/>  They also asserted that certain personages in the media can act as opinion leaders and bring media coverage to a particular issue.<ref name=\"Cobb 1971 892\u2013915\"/> Government-affiliated news sources have higher success rates in becoming media agenda and have been found by a number of scholars to be the most frequently appearing of sources at the local, state, and national levels.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\"/>\n\nNews sources can also provide definitions of issues, thus determining the terms of future discussion and framing problems in particular ways.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\"/><ref name=\"Hilgarten 1988 53\u201378\">{{cite journal|last=Hilgarten|first=S|author2=Bosk, C.L.|title=The rise and fall of social problems: A public arenas model|journal=American Journal of Sociology|year=1988|volume=94|pages=53\u201378|doi=10.1086/228951}}</ref>  What interpretation of \"reality\" will dominate public discourse has implications for the future of the social problem, for the interest groups and policymakers involved, and for the policy itself.<ref name=\"Hilgarten 1988 53\u201378\"/>  For example, Gusfield argues that the highway deaths associated with alcohol consumption can be interpreted as a problem of irresponsible drunken drivers, insufficient automobile [[crashworthiness]], a transportation system overly dependent on cars, poor highway design, excessive emphasis on drinking in adult social life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gusfield|first=J.R.|title=The culture of public problems|url=https://archive.org/details/cultureofpublicp00gusf|url-access=registration|year=1981|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL}}</ref> Different ways of framing the situation may compete to be accepted as an authoritative version of reality,<ref name=\"Hilgarten 1988 53\u201378\"/> consequently spurring competition between sources of information for definition of an issue.

Thus according to Cobb and Elder, the agenda-building framework makes allowances for continuing mass involvement and broaden the range of recognized influences on the public policy-making process.<ref name=\"Cobb 1971 892\u2013915\"/> Although the public does have a place on the list of possibly influencing the media agenda, they are not thought to powerfully shape media agendas. It seems the more correct to argue the possibility that when journalists look to their own interests for story ideas, they are actually trying to predict their audience's needs.\n\nThis idea of mass involvement has become more prominent with the advent of the Internet and its potential to make everyone a pamphleteer.<ref name=\"Benkler\"/> Increase in the role of citizens in agenda setting sheds light on a new direction in the traditional agenda-building research. This is now the case because the general public can now create their own media. Social media has changed the way people view and perceive things in today's world. Mass involvement within social media lets the general publics voices be heard. Comments and reply's give potential for people to address your thoughts or open new doors for conversation.\n\nKim and Lee<ref name=\"Kim\"/> noted that the agenda-setting research on the Internet differs from traditional agenda-setting research with respect that the Internet is in competition with traditional media and has enormous capacity for contents' and users' interactivity.

Scholars found that a person's opinion could be disseminated through various online channels and could synthesize public opinion that influences news coverage. Their study suggests 'reversed agenda effects', meaning that public agenda could set media agenda. Maxwell McCombs<ref>{{cite book|last=McCombs|first=Maxwell|title=Setting the Agenda: The Mass Media and Public Opinion|url=https://archive.org/details/settingagendamas0000mcco/page/198|url-access=registration|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell Pub|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-7456-2313-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/settingagendamas0000mcco/page/198 198]|edition=Repr.}}</ref> also mentioned \"reverse agenda-setting\" in his recent textbook as a situation where public concern sets the media agenda.\n\nAccording to Kim and Lee,<ref name=\"Kim\"/> agenda-building through the Internet take the following three steps: 1) Internet-mediated agenda-rippling: an anonymous netizen's opinion spreads to the important agenda in the Internet through online main rippling channels such as blogs, personal homepages, and the Internet bulletin boards. 2) agenda diffusion in the Internet: online news or web-sites report the important agenda in the Internet that in turn leads to spreading the agenda to more online publics. 3) Internet-mediated reversed agenda-setting: traditional media report online agenda to the public so that the agenda spread to both offline and online publics. However, scholars concluded that the Internet-mediated agenda-setting or agenda-building processes not always occur in consecutive order. For example, the agenda that was reported by traditional media can come to the fore again through the online discussion or the three steps can occur simultaneously in a short period of time.\n\nSeveral studies provide evidence that the Internet-community, particularly bloggers, can push their own agenda into public agenda, then media agenda, and, eventually, into policy agenda. In the most comprehensive study to date, Wallsten<ref>Wallsten, Kevin (2007). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-1338.2007.00300.x/abstract;jsessionid=28AD554C0CBC1E693100AB5BF7818290.f02t04?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false Agenda setting and the blogosphere: An analysis of the relationship between mainstream media and political blogs], [[Review of Policy Research]].</ref> tracked mainstream media coverage and blog discussion of 35 issues during the 2004 presidential campaign. Using [[time-series analysis]], Wallsten found evidence that journalists discuss the issues that bloggers are blogging about. There are also anecdotal pieces of evidence suggesting bloggers exert an influence on the political agenda. For instance, in 2005 Eason Jordan, the chief news executive at CNN, abruptly resigned after being besieged by the online community after saying, according to various witnesses, that he believed the United States military had aimed at journalists in Iraq and killed 12 of them.<ref>{{cite news|last=Seelye|first=K.Q.|title=Resignation at CNN shows the growing influence of blogs|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/14/technology/14cnn.html |accessdate=30 October 2014|work=The New York Times|date=14 February 2005}}</ref> Similarly, in 2002, [[Trent Lott]] had to resign as [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate majority leader]] due to his inappropriate racist remarks that were widely discussed in the blogosphere.<ref name=\"Benkler\">{{cite book|last=Benkler|first=Y|title=The wealth of networks: How Social production transforms markets and freedom|url=https://archive.org/details/wealthofnetworks00benk|url-access=registration|year=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT}}</ref> However bloggers attract attention not only to oust journalists and politicians. An online investigation on technical problems with electronic voting machines started by an activist Bev Harris in 2003 eventually forced traditional media outlets to address issue of electronic voting malperformance. This in turn made Diebold, a company that produces these machines, to acknowledge its fault and take measures to fix it. Many studies have been performed to test the agenda setting theory within global news coverage. One of the findings determined that foreign news that had any mentions of the United States or the UK, greatly influenced public opinion compared to global news that didn't involve either country.\n\n<ref name=\"Benkler\"/>\n\n==Contingency factors==\n{{see also|contingency factors}}\n===Issue obtrusiveness===\nIn an attempt to overcome mirror-image effects of agenda-setting that implied direct influence of media agenda on the audience, several scholars proposed that the model of agenda-setting should include individual/collective audience characteristics or real-world conditions that are likely to affect issue importance. They discovered that certain individual and group characteristics are likely to act as contingent conditions of [[media impact]] and proposed a model of \"audience effects\".<ref name=\"Erbring 1980 16\u201349\" />\n\nAccording to the audience-effects model, [[media coverage]] interacts with the audience's pre-existing sensitivities to produce changes in issue concerns. Thus, media effects are contingent on issue-specific audience characteristics.<ref name=\"Erbring 1980 16\u201349\" /> For instance, for high-sensitivity audiences who are most affected by a certain issue or a problem, the salience of this issue increases substantially with news exposure, while the same exposure has little effect on other groups. Erbring, Goldenberg and Miller have also demonstrated that people who do not talk about political issues are more subject to agenda-setting influence because they depend more heavily on media content than those who receive information from other sources, including their colleagues and friends.<ref name=\"Erbring 1980 16\u201349\" />\n\nAnother factor that causes variations in the [[correlation]] between the media and public agenda is whether an issue is \"obtrusive\" or \"unobtrusive\";<ref name=\"Rogers 1988 555\u2013594\" /> i.e., whether it has a high or low issue threshold.<ref name=\"Lang 1981 447\u2013468\" /> Obtrusive or issues with low threshold are generally the ones that affect nearly everyone and with which we can have some kind of personal experience (e.g. citywide crime or increases in [[Gasoline and diesel usage and pricing|gasoline prices]]). Because of their link to personal concerns, these issues almost compel attention from [[political elite]]s as well as the news media. Moreover, with this type of issues the problem would be of general concern even without attention from the news media.<ref name=\"Lang\">{{cite journal|last=Lang|first=G.E.|author2=Lang, K.|title=Watergate: An exploration of the agenda-building process|editor=Wilhout, G.C.| editor2=de Bock, H.|journal=Mass Communication Review Yearbook|year=1981|volume=2|pages=447\u2013468}}</ref>\n\nUnobtrusive or high threshold issues are those issues that are generally remote from just about everyone (e.g., high-level wrongdoing, such as the [[Watergate scandal]]; plight of [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugees]]). Research performed by Zucker suggests that an issue is obtrusive if most members of the public have had direct contact with it, and less obtrusive if audience members have not had direct experience. This means that the less direct experience people have with an issue, the greater is the news media's influence on public opinion on that issue.<ref name=\"Rogers 1988 555\u2013594\" /><ref name=\"Lang 1981 447\u2013468\" /><ref>{{cite journal|last=Zucker|first=H|title=The variable nature of news media influence.|journal=Communication Yearbook|year=1978|volume=2|pages=225\u2013246}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, unobtrusive or high-threshold issues do not pertain into media agenda as quickly as obtrusive issues and therefore require a buildup, which is a function of more than the amount of space or time the media devote to the story. The latter may push the story past the threshold of inattention, but it is also important to look at the kind of coverage to explain how a certain incident becomes an issue.<ref name=\"Lang 1981 447\u2013468\" />\n\n===Need for orientation===\nAgenda-setting studies typically show variability in the correlation between media and public agenda. To explain differences in the correlation, McCombs and colleagues created the concept of \"need for orientation\", which \"describes individual differences in the desire for orienting cues and background information\".\n\nTwo concepts: [[relevance]] and [[uncertainty]], define an individual's need for orientation. Relevance suggests that an individual will not seek news media information if an issue is not personally relevant. Hence, if relevance is low, people will feel the need for less orientation. There are many issues in our country that are just not relevant to people, because they do not affect us. Many news organizations attempt to frame issues in a way that attempts to make them relevant to its audiences. This is their way of keeping their viewership/readership high. \"Level of uncertainty is the second defining condition of need for orientation. Frequently, individuals already have all the information that they desire about a topic. Their degree of uncertainty is low.\"<ref>Mccombs, (2004) p. 55</ref> When issues are of high personal relevance and uncertainty low, the need to monitor any changes in those issues will be present and there will be a moderate the need for orientation. If at any point in time viewers/readers have high relevance and high uncertainty about any type of issue/event/election campaign there was a high need for orientation.\n\nDavid Weaver (1977)<ref name=\"Weaver, D.

Research done by Weaver in 1977 suggested that individuals vary on their need for orientation. Need for orientation is a combination of the individual's interest in the topic and uncertainty about the issue. The higher levels of interest and uncertainty produce higher levels of need for orientation. So the individual would be considerably likely to be influenced by the [[news media|media]] stories (psychological aspect of theory).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Weaver|first=D|title=Political issues and voter need for orientation|journal=In D.L.

Each of the objects on an agenda has a lot of attributes containing cognitive components such as information that describes characteristics of the object, and an affective component including tones (positive, negative, neutral) of the characteristics on agenda. The agenda setting theory and the second level of agenda setting, framing, are both relevant and similar in demonstrating how society is influenced by media, but they describe a different process of influence. One tells us what information to process and the other tells us how to process that information. Framing theory, an extension of agenda setting, describes how the \"stance\" an article of media may take can affect the perception of the viewer. It is said that there are two main attributes of the second-level of agenda setting. Those include substantive and affective. The substantive factor has to do mainly with things such as personality and ideology. The affective factor is focused on the positive, negative, and neutral side of things.\n\n==== Second-level agenda-setting vs. framing ====\nMcCombs et al. (1997)<ref name=\"McCombs et al 1997\">{{cite journal|last=McCombs|first=M. E.|author2=Llamas, J.

Balmas and Sheafer (2010)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Balmas|first=M|author2=Sheafer, T|title=Candidate Image in Election Campaigns: Attribute Agenda Setting, Affective Priming, and Voting Intentions|journal=International Journal of Public Opinion Research|date=June 2010|volume=22|issue=2|pages=204\u2013229|doi=10.1093/ijpor/edq009}}</ref>  argued that the focus at the first level agenda-setting which emphasizes media's role in telling us \"what to think about\" is shifted to media's function of telling us \"how to think about\" at the second level agenda-setting. The second level of agenda-setting considers how the agenda of attributes affects public opinion (McCombs & Evatt, 1995). Furthermore, Ghanem(1997)<ref name=\"Ghanem, S.\">{{cite book|last=Weaver|first=ed. by Maxwell McCombs, Donald L. Shaw, David|title=Communication and democracy : exploring the intellectual frontiers in agenda-setting theory|year=1997|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, N.J.|isbn=978-0-8058-2555-8|edition=[Nachdr.].}}</ref>  demonstrated that the certain attributes agendas in the news with low psychological distance, drove compelling arguments for the salience of public agenda. The second-level agenda-setting differs from traditional agenda-setting in that it focus on attribute salience, and public's attribute agenda is regarded as one of the important variables. An example of framing is when a company releases a statement that sounds a lot better than what it actually is. Acting like it the fine print that people don't see. They \"frame\" it to sound better and more appealing to the public. This can also take place in crisis management, when companies release a statement to save the companies reputation after a crisis occurred. This was very prominent in the BP oil spill several years ago.\n\nOne example that helps illustrate the effects of framing involves president Nixon's involvement in the watergate scandal. According to a study conducted by Lang and Lang, the media coverage at first belittled the watergate scandal and the President's involvement. It wasn't until the story was framed as one of the highest political scandals in US history that the public opinion changed (Lang & Lang, 1981) This event depicts how the media personnel have a great deal of power in persuading the public's opinions. It also suggests that framing is a form of gatekeeping, similar to  the agenda setting theory.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lang & Lang|title=Watergate: An exploration of the agenda-building process.|journal=Mass Communication Review Yearbook|date=1981}}</ref>\n\nThere is a debate over whether [[Framing (social sciences)|framing theory]] should be subsumed within agenda-setting as \"second-level agenda-setting\". McCombs, Shaw, Weaver and colleagues generally argue that framing is a part of agenda-setting that operates as a \"second-level\" or secondary effect. [[Dietram Scheufele]] has argued the opposite. Scheufele argues that framing and agenda-setting possess distinct theoretical boundaries, operate via distinct cognitive processes (accessibility vs. attribution), and relate to different outcomes (perceptions of issue importance vs. interpretation of news issue).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scheufele|first=D|title=Agenda-setting, priming, and framing revisited: Another look at cognitive effects of political communication|journal=Mass Communication & Society|year=2000|volume=3|issue=2|pages=297\u2013316|doi=10.1207/s15327825mcs0323_07}}</ref>\n\nWhen talking about the second-level of agenda setting, as well as the political aspects of the theory, its pivotal to include priming. Priming is considered to be the step past agenda setting, and is also referred to as the last step of the process. Priming is primarily used in political settings. It discusses how the media will choose to leave some issues about the candidates out of coverage, while presenting other issues in the fore front. This process creates different standards by which the public evaluates candidates. As well, by reporting the issues that have the most salience on the public; they are not objectively presenting both candidates equally. \n \nAccording to Weaver,<ref>Weaver, D. H. (2007). Thoughts on Agenda Setting, Framing, and Priming. Journal of Communication, 57(1), 142\u2013147. {{doi|10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00333.x}}</ref> framing and second-level agenda setting have the following characteristics:\n\n'''Similarities:'''\n\n# Both are more concerned with how issues or other objects are depicted in the media than with which issues or objects are more or less prominently reported.\n# Both focus on most salient or prominent aspects of themes or descriptions of the objects of interest.\n# Both are concerned with ways of thinking rather than objects of thinking\n\n'''Differences:'''\n\n# Framing does seem to include a broader range of cognitive processes \u2013 moral evaluations, causal reasoning, appeals to principle, and recommendations for treatment of problems \u2013 than does second-level agenda-setting (the salience of attributes of an object). <br/> Scheufele and Tewksbury argue that \"framing differs significantly from these accessibility-based models [i.e., agenda setting and priming]. It is based on the assumption that how an issue is characterized in news reports can have an influence on how it is understood by audiences;\"<ref name=\"Scheufele, D. A. 2007\"/> the difference between whether we think about an issue and how we think about it. Framing and agenda setting differ in their functions in the process of '''news production''', '''information processing''' and '''media effects'''.\n# '''News production''': Although \"both frame building and agenda building refer to macroscopic mechanisms that deal with message construction rather than media effects\", frame building is more concerned with the news production process than agenda building. In other words, \"how forces and groups in society try to shape public discourse about an issue by establishing predominant labels is of far greater interest from a framing perspective than from a traditional agenda-setting one.\"\n# '''News processing''': For framing and agenda-setting, different conditions seem to be needed in processing messages to produce respective effects. Framing effect is more concerned with audience attention to news messages, while agenda setting is more concerned with repeated exposure to messages.\n# '''Locus of effect''': Agenda-setting effects are determined by the ease with which people can retrieve from their memory issues recently covered by mass media, while framing is the extent to which media messages fit ideas or knowledge people have in their knowledge store.\n\nBased on these shared characteristics, McCombs and colleagues<ref>McCombs, M. E., Shaw, D. L., & Weaver, D. H. (1997). Communication and democracy: Explorining the intellectual frontiers in agenda-setting theory. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.</ref> recently argued that framing effects should be seen as the extension of agenda setting. In other words, according to them, the premise that framing is about selecting \"a restricted number of thematically related attributes\"<ref>McCombs, M. E., Shaw, D. L., & Weaver, D. H. (1997). p. 106</ref>  for media representation can be understood as the process of transferring the salience of issue attributes (i.e., second-level agenda setting). That is, according to McCombs and colleagues' arguments, framing falls under the umbrella of agenda setting.\n\n====Accessibility (agenda-setting) vs. applicability (framing)====\nAccording to Price and Tewksbury,<ref>Price, V., & Tewksbury, D. (1997). News values and public opinion: A theoretical account of media priming and framing. In G. Barnett & F. Boster (Eds.), Progress in communication sciences (pp. 173-212). Norwood, N.J.: Ablex Pub. Corp.</ref> however, agenda-setting and framing are built on different theoretical premises: agenda-setting is based on '''accessibility''', while framing is concerned with '''applicability''' (i.e., the relevance between message features and one's stored ideas or knowledge). Accessibility-based explanation of agenda-setting is also applied to second-level agenda-setting. That is, transferring the salience of issue attributes (i.e., second-level agenda-setting) is a function of accessibility.\n\nFor framing effects, empirical evidence shows that the impact of frames on public perceptions is mainly determined by perceived importance of specific frames rather than by the quickness of retrieving frames.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = T. | last2 = Clawson | first2 = R. | last3 = Oxley | first3 = Z. | year = 1997 | title = Media framing of a civil liberties conflict and its effect on tolerance | url = | journal = American Political Science Review | volume = 91 | issue = 3| pages = 567\u2013583 | doi=10.2307/2952075| jstor = 2952075 }}</ref> That is, the way framing effects transpires is different from the way second-level agenda-setting is supposed to take place (i.e., accessibility). On a related note, Scheufele and Tewksbury<ref name=\"Scheufele, D. A. 2007\">Scheufele, D. A., & Tewksbury, D. (2007). Framing, agenda-setting, and priming: The evolution of three media effects models. Journal of Communication, 57(1), 9-20.</ref> argues that, because accessibility and applicability vary in their functions of media effects, \"the distinction between accessibility and applicability effects has obvious benefits for understanding and predicting the effects of dynamic information environments\".\n\nTaken together, it can be concluded that the integration of framing into agenda-setting is either impossible because they are based on different theoretical premises or imprudent because merging the two concepts would result in the loss of our capabilities to explain various media effects.\n\n(a) ''' Accessibility (Agenda-setting)'''\n\nIncreasing attention has been devoted to examining how agenda-setting occur in terms of their psychological mechanisms (Holbrook & Hill, 2005). Price and Tewksbury (1997) argued that agenda-setting effects are based on the accessibility model of information processing. Accessibility can be defined as \"how much\" or \"how recently\" a person has been exposed to certain issues (Kim et al., 2002). Specifically, individuals try to make less cognitive effort in forming social judgments, they are more likely to rely on the information that is easily accessible (Higgins, 1996). This leads to a greater probability that more accessible information will be used when people make judgments on certain issues (Iyeanger & Kinder, 1987; Scheufele & Tewksbury, 2007).\n\nThe concept of accessibility is the foundation of a memory-based model (Scheufele, 2000). It assumes that individuals make judgments on the issues based on information that is easily available and retrievable from their memory (Tulving & Watkins, 1975; Hastie & Park, 1986; Iyengar, 1990). Tversky and Kahneman (1974) also argue that the formation of individuals' judgments directly correlates with \"the ease in which instances or associations could be brought to mind\" (p.&nbsp;208). When individuals receive and process information, they develop memory traces that can be easily recalled to make decisions on a certain issue. Agenda-setting, in this regard, can make certain issue to be easily accessed in individual's memory when forming judgment about the issue.\n\n(b) '''Applicability (Framing)'''\n\nThe idea of framing theory is closely related to the agenda-setting theory tradition but it expands more upon the research by focusing on the substance of certain issues at hand rather than on a particular topic. This means that the framing theory's basis is that of the media focuses its attention on certain events and then places them within a field of meaning.  is the process of selecting certain aspects of an issue to bring people's attention and to lead them a particular line of interpretation (Entman, 1993; Scheufele, 1999). Also, the media's selective uses of certain frames can affect the way the audience thinks about the issue (Oh & Kim, 2010). This may sound similar to attribute agenda-setting. Both seem to examine which attributes or aspects of an issue are emphasized in the media (Kim et al., 2011). Some scholars even argue that framing should be considered as an extension of agenda-setting (McCombs, 1997).\n\nHowever, framing is based on the applicability model, which is conceptually different from the accessibility model used in agenda-setting. According to Goffman (1974), individuals actively classify and interpret their life experiences to make sense of the world around them. These classifications and interpretations then become the individual's pre-existing and long-standing schema. Framing influences how audience thinks about issues, not by making certain aspects more salient than others, but by invoking interpretive cues that correspond to the individuals' pre-existing schema (Scheufele, 2000). Also, framing is when these interpretive cues correspond with or activate individuals' pre-existing cognitive schema (Kim et al., 2002). Applicability, in this regard, refers to finding the connection between the message in the media and the framework individuals employ to interpret the issue (Scheufele & Tewksbury, 2007).\n\nKim and his colleagues (2002) provide distinction between the applicability and accessibility models is important in terms of issue salience. Framing assumes that each individual will have its own interpretation of an issue, regardless of the salience of an issue. Specifically, it focuses on the \"terminological or semantic differences\" of how an issue is described. Agenda-setting, on the other hand, assume that only salient issues in the media will become accessible in people's minds when they evaluate or make judgments on the issue. Taken together, the accessibility of issue salience makes the two models of information processing different (Scheufele, 2000).\n\n==== An emotion dimension ====\nAccording to the theory of affective intelligence, \"emotions enhance citizen rationality\". It argues that emotions, particularly negative ones, are crucial in having people pay attention to politics and help shape their political views.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Affective Intelligence and Political Judgment|last1 = Marcus |first1 = George E. |last2 = Neuman |first2 = W.

Three conclusions are presented:\n* The media's emotional-affective agenda corresponds with the public's emotional impressions of candidates;\n* Negative emotions are more powerful than positive emotions;\n* Agenda-setting effects are greater on the audiences' emotions than on their cognitive assessments of character traits.\n\n=== Agenda setting between media and other sources ===\nRecent research on agenda-setting digs into the question of \"who sets the media agenda\".<ref>{{Cite book|title = Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application |edition = 5th |last1 = West |first1 = Richard |last2 = Turner |first2 = Lynn H. |publisher = McGraw-Hill Education|year = 2013|location = New York, NY|pages = 377\u2013378 }}</ref>\n\n==== Power relations between media and other sources ====\nLittlejohn and Foss (2011)<ref>{{Cite book|title = Theories of Human Communication|edition = 10th |last1 = Littlejohn |first1 = Stephen W. |last2 = Foss |first2 = Karen A. |publisher = Waveland Press, Inc.|year = 2010|location = Long Grove, IL }}</ref> suggest that there are four types of power relations between media and other sources:\n* High-power source & high-power media: both are equals in setting the agenda\n* High-power source & low-power media: the source sets the agenda for the media\n* Low-power source & high-power media: the media set their own agenda and may marginalize the source\n* Low-power source & low-power media: both are too weak to set the public agenda\n\n==== Intermedia agenda setting ====\nNews organizations affect one another's agendas.

These publications have a direct effect on local newspapers and television networks that are viewed on a less elite scale.\n\nWebsite networks favor other websites that tend to have a higher viewing and SEO. This type of relationship is known as Power Law which allows the media to have a stronger effect on agenda setting. \"Furthermore, the \"birds of a feather\" argument suggests that because news now exists in a network of connected websites, elite and other types of news media are now more motivated to behave similarly.\"\n\n=== Third-level agenda-setting: network agenda setting model ===\nThe most recent agenda-setting studies explore \"the extent to which the news media can transfer the salience of relationships among a set of elements to the public\".<ref>{{Cite journal|title = New Directions in Agenda-Setting Theory and Research |last1 = McCombs |first1 = Maxwell E. |last2 = Shaw |first2 = Donald L. |last3 = Weaver |first3 = David H. |date = November 2014 |journal = Mass Communication & Society | pages = 781\u2013802 |doi=10.1080/15205436.2014.964871 |volume=17|issue = 6 }}</ref> That is, researchers assume that the media can not only influence the salience of certain topics in public agenda, but they can also influence how the public relate these topics to one another.

This model shows that \"the news media can bundle sets of objects or attributes and make these bundles of elements salient in the public's mind simultaneously\". In other words, elements in people's mind are not linear as traditional approaches indicate; instead, they are interconnected with each other to make a network-like structure in one's mind; and if the news media always mention two elements together, the audience will \"perceive these two elements as interconnected\".\n\n==Application==\n===Twitter application===\nOver the last few years, the increase in social media use has had a direct effect on political campaign strategy, particularly on the Social Media platform Twitter. Its unique platform allows users to showcase their political opinion without functioning two directions. It is currently being viewed as a platform for political advancement. Before the use of Twitter, political candidates were using blogs and websites to portray their message and to gain more attention and popularity among their followers. Some of the most followed users on Twitter are past and current Presidents of the United States and other political figures. In terms of retweets, politicians and political parties have been labeled \"influentials\" on Twitter. Twitter is being used as a resource to gather information, reach a larger audience and engagement, stay up to date with current social and political issues, and to achieve the agenda building role. Twitter helps express public opinion which in turn allows a relationship to form between the media and the public. Some may argue that Twitter is still being used as a place for people to follow celebrity news and the culture of Hollywood more than it is being used for important issues and world news. Some may also argue that Twitter does not have the ability to set an agenda as much as conventional news outlets. A 2015 study found a positive correlation between issue ranks in news coverage and issue ranks in Twitter feeds, suggesting that Twitter and conventional news outlets by and large reflected each other.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Conway|first1=Bethany A.|last2=Kenski|first2=Kate|last3=Wang|first3=Di|title=The Rise of Twitter in the Political Campaign: Searching for Intermedia Agenda-Setting Effects in the Presidential Primary|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|date=July 2015|volume=20|issue=4|pages=363\u2013380|doi=10.1111/jcc4.12124}}</ref> The influence of Twitter may not always seem direct and can change during different phases.\n\n===Non-political application===\nMcCombs and Shaw originally established agenda-setting within the context of a presidential election. Many subsequent studies have looked at agenda setting in the context of an election or in otherwise political contexts. However, more recently scholars have been studying agenda setting in the context of brand community. A brand is defined as what resides in the minds of individuals about a product or service. Brand community is described as a \"specialized, non-geographically bound community based on a structured set of social relations among admirers of a brand.<ref name=Ragas>{{cite journal|last=Ragas|first=Matthew|author2=Marilyn Roberts|title=Agenda Setting and Agenda Melding in an Age of Horizontal and Vertical Media: A New Theoretical Lens for Virtual Brand Communities|journal=Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly|year=2009|volume=86|issue=1|pages=45\u201364|issn=1077-6990|doi=10.1177/107769900908600104}}</ref>\" Under these definitions more than just material products can qualify as a brand, political candidates or even celebrities could be viewed as a brand as well. The theory can also be applied to commercial advertising, business news and corporate reputation,<ref>Carroll, C. E. (2004).

The central theoretical idea of agenda-setting theory fits well in the world of business communication as well as political communication setting. \"In the case of corporate reputations, only the operational definitions of the objects and attributes on these agendas are changed to frame five key theoretical propositions about the influence of news coverage on corporate reputations among the public. This presentation of five basic propositions offers a theoretical roadmap for systematic empirical research into the influence of the mass media on corporate reputations\"<ref>Carroll, Craig E., and Maxwell McCombs. \"Agenda-setting effects of business news on the public's images and opinions about major corporations.\" Corporate reputation review 6.1 (2003): 36-46</ref>\n* '''Agenda-setting in [[advertising]]'''.

Although agenda-setting theory is related to mass communication theory, it can be applied to [[interpersonal communication]] as well. Yang and Stone investigated people who prefer to interpersonal communication have the same agenda as others who rely on mass media. According to them, the public agenda suggested by media can flow through interpersonal communication as well.<ref>Yang, Jin, and Gerald Stone. \"The powerful role of interpersonal communication in agenda setting.\" Mass Communication and Society 6.1 (2003): 57-74.</ref>\n* '''Agenda-setting in crime'''. Agenda-setting can be connected to [[cultivation theory]]. Lowry et al. conducted a longitudinal study and revealed that network television news covering crimes often made the public not only concentrate on criminal cases but also tremble with fear.<ref>Lowry, Dennis T., Tarn Ching Josephine Nio, and Dennis W.

The theory has not been limited to elections, and many scholars constantly explored the agenda-setting effect in a variety of communication situations. This explains that agenda-setting has a theoretical value which is able to synthesize social phenomena and to build new research questions.\n\nAnother contribution of agenda-setting is to show the power of media. Since the study of [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 presidential election]] in [[Erie County, Ohio]], by Paul Lazarsfeld and his colleagues, little evidence of mass communication effects was found over the next twenty years. In 1960, Joseph Klapper's ''Effects of Mass Communication'' also declared the limited effect of media. Agenda-setting caused a paradigm shift in the study of media effects from persuading to informing by its connection of media content and its effects on the public.\n\n==Future==\n\n=== Advent of the Internet ===\nThe advent of the Internet and social networks give rise to a variety of opinions concerning agenda-setting effects online. Some have claimed that the power of traditional media has been weakened.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Meraz | first1 = Sharon | year = 2011 | title = The fight for 'how to think': Traditional media, social networks, and issue interpretation | url = | journal = Journalism | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 107\u2013127 | doi=10.1177/1464884910385193}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wallsten | first1 = Kevin | year = 2007 | title = Agenda setting and the blogosphere: An analysis of the relationship between mainstream media and political blogs | url = | journal = Review of Policy Research | volume = 24 | issue = 6| pages = 567\u2013587 | doi=10.1111/j.1541-1338.2007.00300.x}}</ref> Others think that the agenda-setting process and its role have continued on the Internet, specifically in electronic bulletin boards.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = Marilyn | last2 = Wanta | first2 = Wayne | last3 = Dustin Dzwo | first3 = Tzong-Horng | year = 2002 | title = Agenda setting and issue salience online | url = | journal = Communication Research | volume = 29 | issue = 4| pages = 452\u2013465 | doi=10.1177/0093650202029004004}}</ref> With the presence of rapid mass communication, like social media, the agenda setting theory is both supported and challenged to evolve. Some suggest that social media and traditional media in political campaigns will integrate. Social media is the next step of agenda setting because now popular Twitter handles can now choose what they want their followers to see. While some theorize that the rise of social media will bring a downfall to journalists ability to set the agenda, there is considerable scholarship to counterbalance this form of thinking.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Ryan J|date=2017-02-12|title=Book Review: Jeffrey C Alexander, Elizabeth Butler Breese and Mar\u00eda Luengo (eds) The crisis of journalism reconsidered: Democratic culture, professional codes, digital futureAlexanderJeffrey CBreeseElizabeth ButlerLuengoMar\u00eda (eds) The crisis of journalism reconsidered: Democratic culture, professional codes, digital futureNew York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 2016. 298 pp. ISBN 9781107448513|journal=Journalism: Theory, Practice & Criticism|language=en|volume=18|issue=7|pages=927\u2013929|doi=10.1177/1464884917692894}}</ref> People can also chose which accounts they want to follow on any social media platform. This has changed the way in which agenda setting is going and will continue to change throughout the evolution of technology and different media platforms.\n\nOne example that provides realistic criticism for this theory was the use of Twitter by reporters during the 2012 presidential election<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://shorensteincenter.org/d80-hamby/|title=Did Twitter Kill the Boys on the Bus? Searching for a better way to cover a campaign - Shorenstein Center|date=2013-08-28|work=Shorenstein Center|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en-US}}</ref> and the role that two way communication models now exist within the news media discourse.\n\nTraditional media such as newspapers and broadcast television are \"vertical media\" in which authority, power and influence come from the \"top\" and flow \"down\" to the public. Nowadays vertical media is undergoing rapid decline with the growing of \"horizontal media\" \u2013 new media enables everyone to become a source of information and influence, which means the media is \"distributed horizontally instead of top-down\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = As Digital Media Gets 'Horizontal,' It Acts More Like Local Businesses {{!}} Street Fight|url = http://streetfightmag.com/2013/10/04/as-digital-media-gets-horizontal-it-acts-more-like-local-businesses/|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}</ref>\n\n=== Agenda-melding ===\nAnother change of Agenda-setting Theory is known as '''agenda-melding''', which focuses \"on the personal agendas of individuals vis-\u00e0-vis their community and group affiliations\".<ref name=\"Ragas\"/> This means that individuals join groups and blend their agendas with the agendas of the group. Then groups and communities represent a \"collected agenda of issues\" and \"one joins a group by adopting an agenda\". On the other hand, agenda setting defines groups as \"collections of people based on some shared values, attitudes, or opinions\" that individuals join.<ref name=\"Ragas\"/> This is different from traditional agenda setting because according to Shaw et al. individuals join groups in order to avoid social dissonance and isolation that is also known as \"need for orientation\".<ref name=\"Ragas\"/> Therefore, in the past in order to belong people would learn and adopt the agenda of the group. Now with the ease of access to media, people form their own agendas and then find groups that have similar agendas that they agree with.\n\nThe advances in technology have made agenda melding easy for people to develop because there is a wide range of groups and individual agendas. The Internet makes it possible for people all around the globe to find others with similar agendas and collaborate with them. In the past agenda setting was limited to general topics and it was geographically bound because travel was limited.<ref name=\"Ragas\"/>\n\n==Critique==\nVarious critiques have been made of agenda-setting theory:\n\n*Agenda setting is an inherently causal theory, but few studies establish the hypothesized temporal order (the media should set the public's agenda).\n*The measurement of the dependent variable was originally conceptualized as the public's perceived issue \"salience\", but subsequent studies have conceptualized the dependent variable as awareness, attention, or concern, leading to differing outcomes.\n*Studies tend to aggregate media content categories and public responses into very broad categories, resulting in inflated correlation coefficients.<ref name=\"Rogers 1988 555\u2013594\"/>\n*The theory seemed to imply that the audience takes generally passive position. However, the public is not as passive as the theory assumed. Theorist John Fiske has challenged the view of a passive audience.<ref>Fiske, John. \"Television: Polysemy and popularity.\" Critical Studies in Media Communication 3.4 (1986): 391-408.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{divcol|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Availability heuristic]]\n* [[Business communication]]\n* [[Cultivation theory]]\n* [[Digital journalism]]\n* [[Framing effect (psychology)|Framing effect]]\n* [[Hypodermic needle model]]\n* [[Intertrial priming]]\n* [[Marketing]]\n* [[Mass hysteria]]\n* [[Media bias]]\n* [[Military\u2013industrial\u2013media complex]]\n* [[News values]]\n* [[Overton window]]\n* [[Policy by press release]]\n* [[Political agenda]]\n* [[Politico-media complex]]\n* [[Racial bias in criminal news]]\n* ''[[Schema (psychology)|Schema]]''\n* [[Sensationalism]]\n* [[Sociology]]\n* [[Spin (public relations)|Spin]]\n* [[Yellow journalism]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Further reading===\n* {{cite journal | last1 = McCombs | first1 = M. | last2 = Stroud | first2 = N.

Agenda setting is a social science theory; it also attempts to make predictions. The theory also suggests that media has a great influence to their audience by instilling what they should think instead of what they think. That is, if a news item is covered frequently and prominently, the audience will regard the issue as more important.  \n\nAgenda-setting is the creation of public awareness and concern of salient issues by the news media. As well, agenda-setting describes the way that media attempts to influence viewers, and establish a hierarchy of news prevalence. Two basic assumptions underlie most researches on agenda-setting: \n\n# the press and the media do not reflect reality; they filter and shape it;\n# media concentration on a few issues and subjects leads the public to perceive those issues as more important than other issues.\n\nThese core statements were established by measuring the changes in salience through the use of surveys with the presence of more frequent news coverage.<ref name=\"Dearing 1988 555\u2013594\" /><ref name=\"Rogers 1988 555\u2013594\" />\n\nOne of the most critical aspects in the concept of an agenda-setting role of [[mass communication]] is the time frame for this phenomenon. Different media have different agenda-setting potential. From the perspective of agenda setting, the analysis of the relationship between traditional media and new virtual spaces has witnessed growing momentum.<ref>ARUGUETE, N. (2017). The agenda setting hypothesis in the new media environment. Comunicaci\u00f3n Y Sociedad (0188-252X), (28), 35-58.</ref>\n\nIn the 1968 \"Chapel Hill study\", McCombs and [[Donald Lewis Shaw|Shaw]] demonstrated a strong [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation coefficient]] (r > .9) between what 100 residents of [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]] thought was the most important election issue and what the local and national news media reported was the most important issue.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McCombs|first=M|author2=Shaw, D|title=The agenda-setting function of mass media|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1972|volume=36|issue=2|doi=10.1086/267990|pages=176|url=http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/ESMP/article/view/62207}}</ref> By comparing the salience of issues in news content with the public's perceptions of the most important election issue, McCombs and [[Donald Lewis Shaw|Shaw]] were able to determine the degree to which the media determines [[public opinion]]. Since the 1968 study, published in a 1972 edition of ''[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]'', more than 400 studies have been published on the agenda-setting function of the [[mass media]], and the theory continues to be regarded as relevant.\nStudies have shown that what the media decides to expose in certain countries correlates with their views on things such as politics, economy and culture. Countries that tend to have more political power are more likely to receive media exposure. Financial resources, technologies, foreign trade and money spent on the military can be some of the main factors that explain coverage inequality.<ref name=\"McCombs 2005\">{{cite journal|last=McCombs|first=M|title=A look at agenda-setting: Past, present and future.|journal=Journalism Studies|year=2005|volume=6|issue=4|doi=10.1080/14616700500250438|pages=543\u2013557}}</ref>\n\nAgenda-setting can be traced to the first chapter of [[Walter Lippmann]]'s 1922 book, ''[[Public Opinion (book)|Public Opinion]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lippmann|first=W|title=Public opinion|url=https://archive.org/details/publicopinion00lippgoog|year=1922|publisher=Harcourt|location=New York}}</ref>  In that chapter, \"[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/lippman/ch01.html The World Outside And The Pictures In Our Heads]\", Lippmann argues that the mass media are the principal connection between events in the world and the images in the minds of the public. Without using the term \"agenda-setting\", Walter Lippmann was writing about what we today would call \"agenda-setting\". Following Lippmann, in 1963, [[Bernard Cecil Cohen|Bernard Cohen]] observed that the press \"may not be successful much of the time in telling people what to think, but it is stunningly successful in telling its readers what to think about. The world will look different to different people,\" Cohen continues, \"depending on the map that is drawn for them by writers, editors, and publishers of the paper they read.\"<ref name=\"Cohen 1963\">{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=B|title=The press and foreign policy|year=1963|publisher=Harcourt|location=New York}}</ref> As early as the 1960s, Cohen had expressed the idea that later led to formalization of agenda-setting theory by McCombs and Shaw. The stories with the strongest agenda setting influence tend to be those that involve conflict, terrorism, crime and drug issues within the United States. Those that don't include or involve the United State and politics associate negatively with public opinion. In turn, there is less concern.\n\nAlthough Maxwell McCombs already had some interest in the field, he was exposed to Cohen's work while serving as a faculty member at [[UCLA]], and it was Cohen's work that heavily influenced him, and later Donald Shaw.<ref name=\"Rogers 1993 68\u201384\">{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=E|title=The anatomy of agenda-setting research|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1993|volume=43|issue=2|pages=68\u201384|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1993.tb01263.x}}</ref> The concept of agenda setting was launched by McCombs and Shaw during the 1968 presidential election in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. They examined Lippmann's idea of construction of the pictures in our heads by comparing the issues on the media agenda with key issues on the undecided voters' agenda. They found evidence of agenda setting by identifying that salience of the news agenda is highly correlated to that of the voters' agenda. McCombs and Shaw were the first to provide the field of communication with empirical evidence that demonstrated the power of mass media and its influence on the public agenda. The empirical evidence also earned this theory its credibility amongst other social scientific theories.<ref name=\"Rogers 1993 68\u201384\" /><ref name=\"Dearing 1988 555\u2013594\" />\n\nA relatively unknown scholar named G. Ray Funkhouser performed a study highly similar to McCombs and Shaw's around the same time the authors were formalizing the theory.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Funkhouser|first=G|title=The issues of the sixties: An exploratory study in the dynamics of public opinion|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1973|volume=37|issue=1|pages=62\u201375|doi=10.1086/268060}}</ref>  All three scholars \u2013 McCombs, Shaw, and Funkhouser \u2013 even presented their findings at the same academic conference. Funkhouser's article was published later than McCombs and Shaw's, and Funkhouser doesn't receive as much credit as McCombs and Shaw for discovering agenda setting. According to Everett Rogers, there are two main reasons for this.<ref name=\"Rogers 1993 68\u201384\"/> First, Funkhouser didn't formally name the theory. Second, Funkhouser didn't pursue his research much past the initial article. Rogers also suggests that Funkhouser was geographically isolated at [[Stanford]], cut off from interested researchers, whereas McCombs and Shaw had got other people interested in agenda setting research.\n\n==Type==\nThe research on the effect of agenda setting compares the salience of issues in news content with the public perceptions of the most important issue, and then analyses the extent of influence by guidance of the media. There are three models assumed by Max McCombs: the awareness model, the priorities model and the salience model. Most investigations are centered on these three models. In the research, the dependent variables are media agenda, audience agenda and policy agenda as listed in the following part. Rogers and Dearing identify three types of agenda setting:<ref name=\"Rogers 1988 555\u2013594\"/>\n\n#public agenda setting, in which the public's agenda is the [[Dependent and independent variables#Dependent variable|dependent variable]] (the traditional hypothesis)\n#media agenda setting, in which the media's agenda is treated as the dependent variable (\"agenda building\")\n#policy agenda setting, in which elite policy makers' agendas are treated as the dependent variable (\"political agenda setting\")\n\nMass communication research, Rogers and Dearing argue, has focused a great deal on public agenda setting (e.g. McCombs and Shaw, 1972) and media agenda setting, but has largely ignored [[overton window|policy agenda setting]], which is studied primarily by [[political science|political scientists]]. As such, the authors suggest mass communication scholars pay more attention to how the media and public agendas might influence elite policy maker's agendas (i.e. scholars should ask where the President or members of the U.S. Congress get their news from and how this affects their policies). Writing in 2006, Walgrave and Van Aelst took up Rogers and Dearing's suggestions, creating a preliminary theory of political agenda setting, which examines factors that might influence elite policy makers' agendas.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walgrave|first=S|author2=Van Aelst, P|title=The contingency of the mass media's political agenda setting power: Toward a preliminary theory|journal=Journal of Communication|year=2006|volume=56|pages=88\u2013109|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00005.x}}</ref>\n\n==Accessibility==\nAgenda setting occurs through a cognitive process known as \"accessibility\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Iyengar|first=S|title=News that mattes: Television and American opinion|year=1987|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|author2=Kinder, D}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Iyengar|first=S|title=The accessibility bias in politics: Television news and public opinion|journal=International Journal of Public Opinion Research|year=1990|volume=2|pages=1\u201315|doi=10.1093/ijpor/2.1.1}}</ref> Accessibility implies that the more frequently and prominently the news media cover an issue, the more instances of that issue become accessible in audience's memories. When respondents are asked what the most important problem facing the country is, they answer with the most accessible news issue in memory, which is typically the issue the news media focused on the most. The agenda-setting effect is not the result of receiving one or a few messages but is due to the aggregate impact of a very large number of messages, each of which has a different content but all of which deal with the same general issue.<ref name=\"Dearing 1988 555\u2013594\">{{cite journal|last=Dearing|first=J|title=Agenda-setting research: Where has it been, where is it going?|journal=Communication Yearbook|year=1988|volume=11|pages=555\u2013594|author2=Rogers, E}}</ref> \nMass-media coverage in general and agenda-setting in particular also has a powerful impact on what individuals think that other people are thinking,<ref name=\"Dearing 1988 555\u2013594\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Noelle-Neumann|first=E|title=Turbulances in the climate of opinion:Methodological applications of the spiral of silence theory|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1977|volume=41 | issue = 2|pages=143\u2013158|doi = 10.1086/268371 }}</ref> and hence they tend to allocate more importance to issues that have been extensively covered by mass media.

The media agenda in fact is the result of the influences that certain powerful groups exert as a subtle form of social control. Journalists have limited time and limited resources that can contribute to external sources getting involved in the news media's gatekeeping process, and some scholars have attempted to reveal certain relationships between information sources and the agenda the news media has made up, probing who builds the media agenda. There are multiple sources that can participate in this agenda-building process through various different ways, but researchers have been the most interested in the effectiveness of information aids such as media kits and press releases within the news media agenda, and this is a measure of the success of organizations public relations efforts.\n\nBerkowitz has implemented a more nuanced analysis of agenda-setting and agenda-building theories by introducing the terms policy agenda-setting and policy agenda-building.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\"/> He argues that when scholars investigate only the linkage between media and policymakers, it is still appropriate to use the notion of policy agenda-setting.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\"/> However, when the focus is placed not only on policymakers' personal agendas, but also on the broader salient issues where media represent only one indicator of public sentiment, Berkowitz suggests talking about policy agenda-building.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\"/>\n\n== Research on policymakers and public ==\n\n=== Role of policymakers in agenda-setting process ===\nSome groups have a greater ease of access than others and are thus more likely to get their demands placed on agenda than others.<ref name=\"Cobb 1971 892\u2013915\">{{cite journal|last=Cobb|first=R.W.|author2=Elder, C.|title=The politics of agenda-building: An alternative perspective for modern democratic theory|journal=Journal of Politics|year=1971|volume=33|issue=4|pages=892\u2013915|doi=10.2307/2128415|jstor=2128415|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e47bf34ab7ec85bfc5e0ace18859a5b015c9f347}}</ref>  For instance, policymakers have been found to be more influential than the overall group of news sources because they often better understand journalists' needs for reliable and predictable information and their definition of newsworthiness.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\"/> Cobb and Elder ascribed even more importance to decision makers, claiming that in order for an issue to attain agenda status, it must be supported by at least some of key decision makers as they act as guardians of the formal agenda.<ref name=\"Cobb 1971 892\u2013915\"/>  They also asserted that certain personages in the media can act as opinion leaders and bring media coverage to a particular issue.<ref name=\"Cobb 1971 892\u2013915\"/> Government-affiliated news sources have higher success rates in becoming media agenda and have been found by a number of scholars to be the most frequently appearing of sources at the local, state, and national levels.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\"/>\n\nNews sources can also provide definitions of issues, thus determining the terms of future discussion and framing problems in particular ways.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\"/><ref name=\"Hilgarten 1988 53\u201378\">{{cite journal|last=Hilgarten|first=S|author2=Bosk, C.L.|title=The rise and fall of social problems: A public arenas model|journal=American Journal of Sociology|year=1988|volume=94|pages=53\u201378|doi=10.1086/228951}}</ref>  What interpretation of \"reality\" will dominate public discourse has implications for the future of the social problem, for the interest groups and policymakers involved, and for the policy itself.<ref name=\"Hilgarten 1988 53\u201378\"/>  For example, Gusfield argues that the highway deaths associated with alcohol consumption can be interpreted as a problem of irresponsible drunken drivers, insufficient automobile [[crashworthiness]], a transportation system overly dependent on cars, poor highway design, excessive emphasis on drinking in adult social life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gusfield|first=J.R.|title=The culture of public problems|url=https://archive.org/details/cultureofpublicp00gusf|url-access=registration|year=1981|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL}}</ref> Different ways of framing the situation may compete to be accepted as an authoritative version of reality,<ref name=\"Hilgarten 1988 53\u201378\"/> consequently spurring competition between sources of information for definition of an issue.

Thus according to Cobb and Elder, the agenda-building framework makes allowances for continuing mass involvement and broaden the range of recognized influences on the public policy-making process.<ref name=\"Cobb 1971 892\u2013915\"/> Although the public does have a place on the list of possibly influencing the media agenda, they are not thought to powerfully shape media agendas. It seems the more correct to argue the possibility that when journalists look to their own interests for story ideas, they are actually trying to predict their audience's needs.\n\nThis idea of mass involvement has become more prominent with the advent of the Internet and its potential to make everyone a pamphleteer.<ref name=\"Benkler\"/> Increase in the role of citizens in agenda setting sheds light on a new direction in the traditional agenda-building research. This is now the case because the general public can now create their own media. Social media has changed the way people view and perceive things in today's world. Mass involvement within social media lets the general publics voices be heard. Comments and reply's give potential for people to address your thoughts or open new doors for conversation.\n\nKim and Lee<ref name=\"Kim\"/> noted that the agenda-setting research on the Internet differs from traditional agenda-setting research with respect that the Internet is in competition with traditional media and has enormous capacity for contents' and users' interactivity.

Scholars found that a person's opinion could be disseminated through various online channels and could synthesize public opinion that influences news coverage. Their study suggests 'reversed agenda effects', meaning that public agenda could set media agenda. Maxwell McCombs<ref>{{cite book|last=McCombs|first=Maxwell|title=Setting the Agenda: The Mass Media and Public Opinion|url=https://archive.org/details/settingagendamas0000mcco/page/198|url-access=registration|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell Pub|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-7456-2313-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/settingagendamas0000mcco/page/198 198]|edition=Repr.}}</ref> also mentioned \"reverse agenda-setting\" in his recent textbook as a situation where public concern sets the media agenda.\n\nAccording to Kim and Lee,<ref name=\"Kim\"/> agenda-building through the Internet take the following three steps: 1) Internet-mediated agenda-rippling: an anonymous netizen's opinion spreads to the important agenda in the Internet through online main rippling channels such as blogs, personal homepages, and the Internet bulletin boards. 2) agenda diffusion in the Internet: online news or web-sites report the important agenda in the Internet that in turn leads to spreading the agenda to more online publics. 3) Internet-mediated reversed agenda-setting: traditional media report online agenda to the public so that the agenda spread to both offline and online publics. However, scholars concluded that the Internet-mediated agenda-setting or agenda-building processes not always occur in consecutive order. For example, the agenda that was reported by traditional media can come to the fore again through the online discussion or the three steps can occur simultaneously in a short period of time.\n\nSeveral studies provide evidence that the Internet-community, particularly bloggers, can push their own agenda into public agenda, then media agenda, and, eventually, into policy agenda. In the most comprehensive study to date, Wallsten<ref>Wallsten, Kevin (2007). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-1338.2007.00300.x/abstract;jsessionid=28AD554C0CBC1E693100AB5BF7818290.f02t04?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false Agenda setting and the blogosphere: An analysis of the relationship between mainstream media and political blogs], [[Review of Policy Research]].</ref> tracked mainstream media coverage and blog discussion of 35 issues during the 2004 presidential campaign. Using [[time-series analysis]], Wallsten found evidence that journalists discuss the issues that bloggers are blogging about. There are also anecdotal pieces of evidence suggesting bloggers exert an influence on the political agenda. For instance, in 2005 Eason Jordan, the chief news executive at CNN, abruptly resigned after being besieged by the online community after saying, according to various witnesses, that he believed the United States military had aimed at journalists in Iraq and killed 12 of them.<ref>{{cite news|last=Seelye|first=K.Q.|title=Resignation at CNN shows the growing influence of blogs|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/14/technology/14cnn.html |accessdate=30 October 2014|work=The New York Times|date=14 February 2005}}</ref> Similarly, in 2002, [[Trent Lott]] had to resign as [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate majority leader]] due to his inappropriate racist remarks that were widely discussed in the blogosphere.<ref name=\"Benkler\">{{cite book|last=Benkler|first=Y|title=The wealth of networks: How Social production transforms markets and freedom|url=https://archive.org/details/wealthofnetworks00benk|url-access=registration|year=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT}}</ref> However bloggers attract attention not only to oust journalists and politicians. An online investigation on technical problems with electronic voting machines started by an activist Bev Harris in 2003 eventually forced traditional media outlets to address issue of electronic voting malperformance. This in turn made Diebold, a company that produces these machines, to acknowledge its fault and take measures to fix it. Many studies have been performed to test the agenda setting theory within global news coverage. One of the findings determined that foreign news that had any mentions of the United States or the UK, greatly influenced public opinion compared to global news that didn't involve either country.\n\n<ref name=\"Benkler\"/>\n\n==Contingency factors==\n\n===Issue obtrusiveness===\nIn an attempt to overcome mirror-image effects of agenda-setting that implied direct influence of media agenda on the audience, several scholars proposed that the model of agenda-setting should include individual/collective audience characteristics or real-world conditions that are likely to affect issue importance. They discovered that certain individual and group characteristics are likely to act as contingent conditions of media impact and proposed a model of \"audience effects\".<ref name=\"Erbring 1980 16\u201349\" />\n\nAccording to the audience-effects model, media coverage interacts with the audience's pre-existing sensitivities to produce changes in issue concerns. Thus, media effects are contingent on issue-specific audience characteristics.<ref name=\"Erbring 1980 16\u201349\" /> For instance, for high-sensitivity audiences who are most affected by a certain issue or a problem, the salience of this issue increases substantially with news exposure, while the same exposure has little effect on other groups. Erbring, Goldenberg and Miller have also demonstrated that people who do not talk about political issues are more subject to agenda-setting influence because they depend more heavily on media content than those who receive information from other sources, including their colleagues and friends.<ref name=\"Erbring 1980 16\u201349\" />\n\nAnother factor that causes variations in the correlation between the media and public agenda is whether an issue is \"obtrusive\" or \"unobtrusive\";<ref name=\"Rogers 1988 555\u2013594\" /> i.e., whether it has a high or low issue threshold.<ref name=\"Lang 1981 447\u2013468\" /> Obtrusive or issues with low threshold are generally the ones that affect nearly everyone and with which we can have some kind of personal experience (e.g. citywide crime or increases in [[Gasoline and diesel usage and pricing|gasoline prices]]). Because of their link to personal concerns, these issues almost compel attention from political elites as well as the news media. Moreover, with this type of issues the problem would be of general concern even without attention from the news media.<ref name=\"Lang\">{{cite journal|last=Lang|first=G.E.|author2=Lang, K.|title=Watergate: An exploration of the agenda-building process|editor=Wilhout, G.C.| editor2=de Bock, H.|journal=Mass Communication Review Yearbook|year=1981|volume=2|pages=447\u2013468}}</ref>\n\nUnobtrusive or high threshold issues are those issues that are generally remote from just about everyone (e.g., high-level wrongdoing, such as the [[Watergate scandal]]; plight of [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugees]]). Research performed by Zucker suggests that an issue is obtrusive if most members of the public have had direct contact with it, and less obtrusive if audience members have not had direct experience. This means that the less direct experience people have with an issue, the greater is the news media's influence on public opinion on that issue.<ref name=\"Rogers 1988 555\u2013594\" /><ref name=\"Lang 1981 447\u2013468\" /><ref>{{cite journal|last=Zucker|first=H|title=The variable nature of news media influence.|journal=Communication Yearbook|year=1978|volume=2|pages=225\u2013246}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, unobtrusive or high-threshold issues do not pertain into media agenda as quickly as obtrusive issues and therefore require a buildup, which is a function of more than the amount of space or time the media devote to the story. The latter may push the story past the threshold of inattention, but it is also important to look at the kind of coverage to explain how a certain incident becomes an issue.<ref name=\"Lang 1981 447\u2013468\" />\n\n===Need for orientation===\nAgenda-setting studies typically show variability in the correlation between media and public agenda. To explain differences in the correlation, McCombs and colleagues created the concept of \"need for orientation\", which \"describes individual differences in the desire for orienting cues and background information\".\n\nTwo concepts: [[relevance]] and [[uncertainty]], define an individual's need for orientation. Relevance suggests that an individual will not seek news media information if an issue is not personally relevant. Hence, if relevance is low, people will feel the need for less orientation. There are many issues in our country that are just not relevant to people, because they do not affect us. Many news organizations attempt to frame issues in a way that attempts to make them relevant to its audiences. This is their way of keeping their viewership/readership high. \"Level of uncertainty is the second defining condition of need for orientation. Frequently, individuals already have all the information that they desire about a topic. Their degree of uncertainty is low.\"<ref>Mccombs, (2004) p. 55</ref> When issues are of high personal relevance and uncertainty low, the need to monitor any changes in those issues will be present and there will be a moderate the need for orientation. If at any point in time viewers/readers have high relevance and high uncertainty about any type of issue/event/election campaign there was a high need for orientation.\n\nDavid Weaver (1977)<ref name=\"Weaver, D. H.\">{{cite book|last=al.]|first=Donald L. Shaw, Maxwell E. McCombs ; in association with Lee B. Becker ...

Research done by Weaver in 1977 suggested that individuals vary on their need for orientation. Need for orientation is a combination of the individual's interest in the topic and uncertainty about the issue. The higher levels of interest and uncertainty produce higher levels of need for orientation. So the individual would be considerably likely to be influenced by the [[news media|media]] stories (psychological aspect of theory).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Weaver|first=D|title=Political issues and voter need for orientation|journal=In D.L.

Each of the objects on an agenda has a lot of attributes containing cognitive components such as information that describes characteristics of the object, and an affective component including tones (positive, negative, neutral) of the characteristics on agenda. The agenda setting theory and the second level of agenda setting, framing, are both relevant and similar in demonstrating how society is influenced by media, but they describe a different process of influence. One tells us what information to process and the other tells us how to process that information. Framing theory, an extension of agenda setting, describes how the \"stance\" an article of media may take can affect the perception of the viewer. It is said that there are two main attributes of the second-level of agenda setting. Those include substantive and affective. The substantive factor has to do mainly with things such as personality and ideology. The affective factor is focused on the positive, negative, and neutral side of things.\n\n==== Second-level agenda-setting vs. framing ====\nMcCombs et al.

The second level of agenda-setting considers how the agenda of attributes affects public opinion (McCombs & Evatt, 1995). Furthermore, Ghanem(1997)<ref name=\"Ghanem, S.\">{{cite book|last=Weaver|first=ed. by Maxwell McCombs, Donald L. Shaw, David|title=Communication and democracy : exploring the intellectual frontiers in agenda-setting theory|year=1997|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, N.J.|isbn=978-0-8058-2555-8|edition=[Nachdr.].}}</ref>  demonstrated that the certain attributes agendas in the news with low psychological distance, drove compelling arguments for the salience of public agenda. The second-level agenda-setting differs from traditional agenda-setting in that it focus on attribute salience, and public's attribute agenda is regarded as one of the important variables. An example of framing is when a company releases a statement that sounds a lot better than what it actually is. Acting like it the fine print that people don't see. They \"frame\" it to sound better and more appealing to the public. This can also take place in crisis management, when companies release a statement to save the companies reputation after a crisis occurred. This was very prominent in the BP oil spill several years ago.\n\nOne example that helps illustrate the effects of framing involves president Nixon's involvement in the watergate scandal. According to a study conducted by Lang and Lang, the media coverage at first belittled the watergate scandal and the President's involvement. It wasn't until the story was framed as one of the highest political scandals in US history that the public opinion changed (Lang & Lang, 1981) This event depicts how the media personnel have a great deal of power in persuading the public's opinions. It also suggests that framing is a form of gatekeeping, similar to  the agenda setting theory.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lang & Lang|title=Watergate: An exploration of the agenda-building process.|journal=Mass Communication Review Yearbook|date=1981}}</ref>\n\nThere is a debate over whether [[Framing (social sciences)|framing theory]] should be subsumed within agenda-setting as \"second-level agenda-setting\". McCombs, Shaw, Weaver and colleagues generally argue that framing is a part of agenda-setting that operates as a \"second-level\" or secondary effect. [[Dietram Scheufele]] has argued the opposite. Scheufele argues that framing and agenda-setting possess distinct theoretical boundaries, operate via distinct cognitive processes (accessibility vs. attribution), and relate to different outcomes (perceptions of issue importance vs. interpretation of news issue).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scheufele|first=D|title=Agenda-setting, priming, and framing revisited: Another look at cognitive effects of political communication|journal=Mass Communication & Society|year=2000|volume=3|issue=2|pages=297\u2013316|doi=10.1207/s15327825mcs0323_07}}</ref>\n\nWhen talking about the second-level of agenda setting, as well as the political aspects of the theory, its pivotal to include priming. Priming is considered to be the step past agenda setting, and is also referred to as the last step of the process. Priming is primarily used in political settings. It discusses how the media will choose to leave some issues about the candidates out of coverage, while presenting other issues in the fore front. This process creates different standards by which the public evaluates candidates. As well, by reporting the issues that have the most salience on the public; they are not objectively presenting both candidates equally. \n \nAccording to Weaver,<ref>Weaver, D. H. (2007). Thoughts on Agenda Setting, Framing, and Priming. Journal of Communication, 57(1), 142\u2013147. {{doi|10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00333.x}}</ref> framing and second-level agenda setting have the following characteristics:\n\n'''Similarities:'''\n\n# Both are more concerned with how issues or other objects are depicted in the media than with which issues or objects are more or less prominently reported.\n# Both focus on most salient or prominent aspects of themes or descriptions of the objects of interest.\n# Both are concerned with ways of thinking rather than objects of thinking\n\n'''Differences:'''\n\n# Framing does seem to include a broader range of cognitive processes \u2013 moral evaluations, causal reasoning, appeals to principle, and recommendations for treatment of problems \u2013 than does second-level agenda-setting (the salience of attributes of an object). <br/> Scheufele and Tewksbury argue that \"framing differs significantly from these accessibility-based models [i.e., agenda setting and priming]. It is based on the assumption that how an issue is characterized in news reports can have an influence on how it is understood by audiences;\"<ref name=\"Scheufele, D. A. 2007\"/> the difference between whether we think about an issue and how we think about it. Framing and agenda setting differ in their functions in the process of '''news production''', '''information processing''' and '''media effects'''.\n# '''News production''': Although \"both frame building and agenda building refer to macroscopic mechanisms that deal with message construction rather than media effects\", frame building is more concerned with the news production process than agenda building. In other words, \"how forces and groups in society try to shape public discourse about an issue by establishing predominant labels is of far greater interest from a framing perspective than from a traditional agenda-setting one.\"\n# '''News processing''': For framing and agenda-setting, different conditions seem to be needed in processing messages to produce respective effects. Framing effect is more concerned with audience attention to news messages, while agenda setting is more concerned with repeated exposure to messages.\n# '''Locus of effect''': Agenda-setting effects are determined by the ease with which people can retrieve from their memory issues recently covered by mass media, while framing is the extent to which media messages fit ideas or knowledge people have in their knowledge store.\n\nBased on these shared characteristics, McCombs and colleagues<ref>McCombs, M. E., Shaw, D. L., & Weaver, D. H. (1997). Communication and democracy: Explorining the intellectual frontiers in agenda-setting theory. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.</ref> recently argued that framing effects should be seen as the extension of agenda setting. In other words, according to them, the premise that framing is about selecting \"a restricted number of thematically related attributes\"<ref>McCombs, M. E., Shaw, D. L., & Weaver, D. H. (1997). p. 106</ref>  for media representation can be understood as the process of transferring the salience of issue attributes (i.e., second-level agenda setting). That is, according to McCombs and colleagues' arguments, framing falls under the umbrella of agenda setting.\n\n====Accessibility (agenda-setting) vs. applicability (framing)====\nAccording to Price and Tewksbury,<ref>Price, V., & Tewksbury, D. (1997). News values and public opinion: A theoretical account of media priming and framing. In G. Barnett & F. Boster (Eds.), Progress in communication sciences (pp. 173-212). Norwood, N.J.: Ablex Pub. Corp.</ref> however, agenda-setting and framing are built on different theoretical premises: agenda-setting is based on '''accessibility''', while framing is concerned with '''applicability''' (i.e., the relevance between message features and one's stored ideas or knowledge). Accessibility-based explanation of agenda-setting is also applied to second-level agenda-setting. That is, transferring the salience of issue attributes (i.e., second-level agenda-setting) is a function of accessibility.\n\nFor framing effects, empirical evidence shows that the impact of frames on public perceptions is mainly determined by perceived importance of specific frames rather than by the quickness of retrieving frames.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = T. | last2 = Clawson | first2 = R. | last3 = Oxley | first3 = Z. | year = 1997 | title = Media framing of a civil liberties conflict and its effect on tolerance | url = | journal = American Political Science Review | volume = 91 | issue = 3| pages = 567\u2013583 | doi=10.2307/2952075| jstor = 2952075 }}</ref> That is, the way framing effects transpires is different from the way second-level agenda-setting is supposed to take place (i.e., accessibility). On a related note, Scheufele and Tewksbury<ref name=\"Scheufele, D. A. 2007\">Scheufele, D. A., & Tewksbury, D. (2007). Framing, agenda-setting, and priming: The evolution of three media effects models. Journal of Communication, 57(1), 9-20.</ref> argues that, because accessibility and applicability vary in their functions of media effects, \"the distinction between accessibility and applicability effects has obvious benefits for understanding and predicting the effects of dynamic information environments\".\n\nTaken together, it can be concluded that the integration of framing into agenda-setting is either impossible because they are based on different theoretical premises or imprudent because merging the two concepts would result in the loss of our capabilities to explain various media effects.\n\n(a) ''' Accessibility (Agenda-setting)'''\n\nIncreasing attention has been devoted to examining how agenda-setting occur in terms of their psychological mechanisms (Holbrook & Hill, 2005). Price and Tewksbury (1997) argued that agenda-setting effects are based on the accessibility model of information processing. Accessibility can be defined as \"how much\" or \"how recently\" a person has been exposed to certain issues (Kim et al., 2002). Specifically, individuals try to make less cognitive effort in forming social judgments, they are more likely to rely on the information that is easily accessible (Higgins, 1996). This leads to a greater probability that more accessible information will be used when people make judgments on certain issues (Iyeanger & Kinder, 1987; Scheufele & Tewksbury, 2007).\n\nThe concept of accessibility is the foundation of a memory-based model (Scheufele, 2000). It assumes that individuals make judgments on the issues based on information that is easily available and retrievable from their memory (Tulving & Watkins, 1975; Hastie & Park, 1986; Iyengar, 1990). Tversky and Kahneman (1974) also argue that the formation of individuals' judgments directly correlates with \"the ease in which instances or associations could be brought to mind\" (p.&nbsp;208). When individuals receive and process information, they develop memory traces that can be easily recalled to make decisions on a certain issue. Agenda-setting, in this regard, can make certain issue to be easily accessed in individual's memory when forming judgment about the issue.\n\n(b) '''Applicability (Framing)'''\n\nThe idea of framing theory is closely related to the agenda-setting theory tradition but it expands more upon the research by focusing on the substance of certain issues at hand rather than on a particular topic. This means that the framing theory's basis is that of the media focuses its attention on certain events and then places them within a field of meaning.  is the process of selecting certain aspects of an issue to bring people's attention and to lead them a particular line of interpretation (Entman, 1993; Scheufele, 1999). Also, the media's selective uses of certain frames can affect the way the audience thinks about the issue (Oh & Kim, 2010). This may sound similar to attribute agenda-setting. Both seem to examine which attributes or aspects of an issue are emphasized in the media (Kim et al., 2011). Some scholars even argue that framing should be considered as an extension of agenda-setting (McCombs, 1997).\n\nHowever, framing is based on the applicability model, which is conceptually different from the accessibility model used in agenda-setting. According to Goffman (1974), individuals actively classify and interpret their life experiences to make sense of the world around them. These classifications and interpretations then become the individual's pre-existing and long-standing schema. Framing influences how audience thinks about issues, not by making certain aspects more salient than others, but by invoking interpretive cues that correspond to the individuals' pre-existing schema (Scheufele, 2000). Also, framing is when these interpretive cues correspond with or activate individuals' pre-existing cognitive schema (Kim et al., 2002). Applicability, in this regard, refers to finding the connection between the message in the media and the framework individuals employ to interpret the issue (Scheufele & Tewksbury, 2007).\n\nKim and his colleagues (2002) provide distinction between the applicability and accessibility models is important in terms of issue salience. Framing assumes that each individual will have its own interpretation of an issue, regardless of the salience of an issue. Specifically, it focuses on the \"terminological or semantic differences\" of how an issue is described. Agenda-setting, on the other hand, assume that only salient issues in the media will become accessible in people's minds when they evaluate or make judgments on the issue. Taken together, the accessibility of issue salience makes the two models of information processing different (Scheufele, 2000).\n\n==== An emotion dimension ====\nAccording to the theory of affective intelligence, \"emotions enhance citizen rationality\". It argues that emotions, particularly negative ones, are crucial in having people pay attention to politics and help shape their political views.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Affective Intelligence and Political Judgment|last1 = Marcus |first1 = George E. |last2 = Neuman |first2 = W.

They find that apart from the cognitive assessment, which is commonly studied before, emotion is another critical dimension of the second-level affects in agenda-setting. Three conclusions are presented:\n* The media's emotional-affective agenda corresponds with the public's emotional impressions of candidates;\n* Negative emotions are more powerful than positive emotions;\n* Agenda-setting effects are greater on the audiences' emotions than on their cognitive assessments of character traits.\n\n=== Agenda setting between media and other sources ===\nRecent research on agenda-setting digs into the question of \"who sets the media agenda\".<ref>{{Cite book|title = Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application |edition = 5th |last1 = West |first1 = Richard |last2 = Turner |first2 = Lynn H. |publisher = McGraw-Hill Education|year = 2013|location = New York, NY|pages = 377\u2013378 }}</ref>\n\n==== Power relations between media and other sources ====\nLittlejohn and Foss (2011)<ref>{{Cite book|title = Theories of Human Communication|edition = 10th |last1 = Littlejohn |first1 = Stephen W. |last2 = Foss |first2 = Karen A. |publisher = Waveland Press, Inc.|year = 2010|location = Long Grove, IL }}</ref> suggest that there are four types of power relations between media and other sources:\n* High-power source & high-power media: both are equals in setting the agenda\n* High-power source & low-power media: the source sets the agenda for the media\n* Low-power source & high-power media: the media set their own agenda and may marginalize the source\n* Low-power source & low-power media: both are too weak to set the public agenda\n\n==== Intermedia agenda setting ====\nNews organizations affect one another's agendas.

These publications have a direct effect on local newspapers and television networks that are viewed on a less elite scale.\n\nWebsite networks favor other websites that tend to have a higher viewing and SEO. This type of relationship is known as Power Law which allows the media to have a stronger effect on agenda setting. \"Furthermore, the \"birds of a feather\" argument suggests that because news now exists in a network of connected websites, elite and other types of news media are now more motivated to behave similarly.\"\n\n=== Third-level agenda-setting: network agenda setting model ===\nThe most recent agenda-setting studies explore \"the extent to which the news media can transfer the salience of relationships among a set of elements to the public\".<ref>{{Cite journal|title = New Directions in Agenda-Setting Theory and Research |last1 = McCombs |first1 = Maxwell E. |last2 = Shaw |first2 = Donald L. |last3 = Weaver |first3 = David H. |date = November 2014 |journal = Mass Communication & Society | pages = 781\u2013802 |doi=10.1080/15205436.2014.964871 |volume=17|issue = 6 }}</ref> That is, researchers assume that the media can not only influence the salience of certain topics in public agenda, but they can also influence how the public relate these topics to one another.

This model shows that \"the news media can bundle sets of objects or attributes and make these bundles of elements salient in the public's mind simultaneously\". In other words, elements in people's mind are not linear as traditional approaches indicate; instead, they are interconnected with each other to make a network-like structure in one's mind; and if the news media always mention two elements together, the audience will \"perceive these two elements as interconnected\".\n\n==Application==\n===Twitter application===\nOver the last few years, the increase in social media use has had a direct effect on political campaign strategy, particularly on the Social Media platform Twitter. Its unique platform allows users to showcase their political opinion without functioning two directions. It is currently being viewed as a platform for political advancement. Before the use of Twitter, political candidates were using blogs and websites to portray their message and to gain more attention and popularity among their followers. Some of the most followed users on Twitter are past and current Presidents of the United States and other political figures. In terms of retweets, politicians and political parties have been labeled \"influentials\" on Twitter. Twitter is being used as a resource to gather information, reach a larger audience and engagement, stay up to date with current social and political issues, and to achieve the agenda building role. Twitter helps express public opinion which in turn allows a relationship to form between the media and the public. Some may argue that Twitter is still being used as a place for people to follow celebrity news and the culture of Hollywood more than it is being used for important issues and world news. Some may also argue that Twitter does not have the ability to set an agenda as much as conventional news outlets. A 2015 study found a positive correlation between issue ranks in news coverage and issue ranks in Twitter feeds, suggesting that Twitter and conventional news outlets by and large reflected each other.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Conway|first1=Bethany A.|last2=Kenski|first2=Kate|last3=Wang|first3=Di|title=The Rise of Twitter in the Political Campaign: Searching for Intermedia Agenda-Setting Effects in the Presidential Primary|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|date=July 2015|volume=20|issue=4|pages=363\u2013380|doi=10.1111/jcc4.12124}}</ref> The influence of Twitter may not always seem direct and can change during different phases.\n\n===Non-political application===\nMcCombs and Shaw originally established agenda-setting within the context of a presidential election. Many subsequent studies have looked at agenda setting in the context of an election or in otherwise political contexts. However, more recently scholars have been studying agenda setting in the context of brand community. A brand is defined as what resides in the minds of individuals about a product or service. Brand community is described as a \"specialized, non-geographically bound community based on a structured set of social relations among admirers of a brand.<ref name=Ragas>{{cite journal|last=Ragas|first=Matthew|author2=Marilyn Roberts|title=Agenda Setting and Agenda Melding in an Age of Horizontal and Vertical Media: A New Theoretical Lens for Virtual Brand Communities|journal=Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly|year=2009|volume=86|issue=1|pages=45\u201364|issn=1077-6990|doi=10.1177/107769900908600104}}</ref>\" Under these definitions more than just material products can qualify as a brand, political candidates or even celebrities could be viewed as a brand as well.

The theory has not been limited to elections, and many scholars constantly explored the agenda-setting effect in a variety of communication situations. This explains that agenda-setting has a theoretical value which is able to synthesize social phenomena and to build new research questions.\n\nAnother contribution of agenda-setting is to show the power of media. Since the study of [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 presidential election]] in [[Erie County, Ohio]], by Paul Lazarsfeld and his colleagues, little evidence of mass communication effects was found over the next twenty years. In 1960, Joseph Klapper's ''Effects of Mass Communication'' also declared the limited effect of media. Agenda-setting caused a paradigm shift in the study of media effects from persuading to informing by its connection of media content and its effects on the public.\n\n==Future==\n\n=== Advent of the Internet ===\nThe advent of the Internet and social networks give rise to a variety of opinions concerning agenda-setting effects online. Some have claimed that the power of traditional media has been weakened.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Meraz | first1 = Sharon | year = 2011 | title = The fight for 'how to think': Traditional media, social networks, and issue interpretation | url = | journal = Journalism | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 107\u2013127 | doi=10.1177/1464884910385193}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wallsten | first1 = Kevin | year = 2007 | title = Agenda setting and the blogosphere: An analysis of the relationship between mainstream media and political blogs | url = | journal = Review of Policy Research | volume = 24 | issue = 6| pages = 567\u2013587 | doi=10.1111/j.1541-1338.2007.00300.x}}</ref> Others think that the agenda-setting process and its role have continued on the Internet, specifically in electronic bulletin boards.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = Marilyn | last2 = Wanta | first2 = Wayne | last3 = Dustin Dzwo | first3 = Tzong-Horng | year = 2002 | title = Agenda setting and issue salience online | url = | journal = Communication Research | volume = 29 | issue = 4| pages = 452\u2013465 | doi=10.1177/0093650202029004004}}</ref> With the presence of rapid mass communication, like social media, the agenda setting theory is both supported and challenged to evolve. Some suggest that social media and traditional media in political campaigns will integrate. Social media is the next step of agenda setting because now popular Twitter handles can now choose what they want their followers to see. While some theorize that the rise of social media will bring a downfall to journalists ability to set the agenda, there is considerable scholarship to counterbalance this form of thinking.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Ryan J|date=2017-02-12|title=Book Review: Jeffrey C Alexander, Elizabeth Butler Breese and Mar\u00eda Luengo (eds) The crisis of journalism reconsidered: Democratic culture, professional codes, digital futureAlexanderJeffrey CBreeseElizabeth ButlerLuengoMar\u00eda (eds) The crisis of journalism reconsidered: Democratic culture, professional codes, digital futureNew York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 2016. 298 pp. ISBN 9781107448513|journal=Journalism: Theory, Practice & Criticism|language=en|volume=18|issue=7|pages=927\u2013929|doi=10.1177/1464884917692894}}</ref> People can also chose which accounts they want to follow on any social media platform. This has changed the way in which agenda setting is going and will continue to change throughout the evolution of technology and different media platforms.\n\nOne example that provides realistic criticism for this theory was the use of Twitter by reporters during the 2012 presidential election<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://shorensteincenter.org/d80-hamby/|title=Did Twitter Kill the Boys on the Bus? Searching for a better way to cover a campaign - Shorenstein Center|date=2013-08-28|work=Shorenstein Center|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en-US}}</ref> and the role that two way communication models now exist within the news media discourse.\n\nTraditional media such as newspapers and broadcast television are \"vertical media\" in which authority, power and influence come from the \"top\" and flow \"down\" to the public. Nowadays vertical media is undergoing rapid decline with the growing of \"horizontal media\" \u2013 new media enables everyone to become a source of information and influence, which means the media is \"distributed horizontally instead of top-down\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = As Digital Media Gets 'Horizontal,' It Acts More Like Local Businesses {{!}} Street Fight|url = http://streetfightmag.com/2013/10/04/as-digital-media-gets-horizontal-it-acts-more-like-local-businesses/|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}</ref>\n\n=== Agenda-melding ===\nAnother change of Agenda-setting Theory is known as '''agenda-melding''', which focuses \"on the personal agendas of individuals vis-\u00e0-vis their community and group affiliations\".<ref name=\"Ragas\"/> This means that individuals join groups and blend their agendas with the agendas of the group. Then groups and communities represent a \"collected agenda of issues\" and \"one joins a group by adopting an agenda\". On the other hand, agenda setting defines groups as \"collections of people based on some shared values, attitudes, or opinions\" that individuals join.<ref name=\"Ragas\"/> This is different from traditional agenda setting because according to Shaw et al. individuals join groups in order to avoid social dissonance and isolation that is also known as \"need for orientation\".<ref name=\"Ragas\"/> Therefore, in the past in order to belong people would learn and adopt the agenda of the group. Now with the ease of access to media, people form their own agendas and then find groups that have similar agendas that they agree with.\n\nThe advances in technology have made agenda melding easy for people to develop because there is a wide range of groups and individual agendas. The Internet makes it possible for people all around the globe to find others with similar agendas and collaborate with them. In the past agenda setting was limited to general topics and it was geographically bound because travel was limited.<ref name=\"Ragas\"/>\n\n==Critique==\nVarious critiques have been made of agenda-setting theory:\n\n*Agenda setting is an inherently causal theory, but few studies establish the hypothesized temporal order (the media should set the public's agenda).\n*The measurement of the dependent variable was originally conceptualized as the public's perceived issue \"salience\", but subsequent studies have conceptualized the dependent variable as awareness, attention, or concern, leading to differing outcomes.\n*Studies tend to aggregate media content categories and public responses into very broad categories, resulting in inflated correlation coefficients.<ref name=\"Rogers 1988 555\u2013594\"/>\n*The theory seemed to imply that the audience takes generally passive position. However, the public is not as passive as the theory assumed. Theorist John Fiske has challenged the view of a passive audience.<ref>Fiske, John. \"Television: Polysemy and popularity.\" Critical Studies in Media Communication 3.4 (1986): 391-408.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{divcol|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Availability heuristic]]\n* [[Business communication]]\n* [[Cultivation theory]]\n* [[Digital journalism]]\n* [[Framing effect (psychology)|Framing effect]]\n* [[Hypodermic needle model]]\n* [[Intertrial priming]]\n* [[Marketing]]\n* [[Mass hysteria]]\n* [[Media bias]]\n* [[Military\u2013industrial\u2013media complex]]\n* [[News values]]\n* [[Overton window]]\n* [[Policy by press release]]\n* [[Political agenda]]\n* [[Politico-media complex]]\n* [[Racial bias in criminal news]]\n* ''[[Schema (psychology)|Schema]]''\n* [[Sensationalism]]\n* [[Sociology]]\n* [[Spin (public relations)|Spin]]\n* [[Yellow journalism]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Further reading===\n* {{cite journal | last1 = McCombs | first1 = M. | last2 = Stroud | first2 = N.

In March 2002, he went to Kuwait to help handle the issue of Kuwaiti prisoners of war and those reported missing in action during the Iraq War, as well as heading the 'No to war, Yes to peace' Campaign to deliver aid to the children of Iraq. He also raised a tent at the Rafah Border Crossing on the Egyptian \u2013 Palestine border under the slogan 'Stop The Bleeding' as a protest over Israel's January 2009 invasion of the Gaza Strip.[6] [[IOPCR]] has engaged in various forms of aid work in Algeria, Iran, Pakistan, Egypt, Sudan, Bosnia as well as made local contributions to different care centers throughout Libya such as orphanages and homes for the elderly. During recent years El-Hamedi has achieved agreements with a number of International Organizations working in the field of humanitarian relief such as The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), The International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD), The Italian Council for Refugees (CIR),[9] The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), The Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC),[10] - Doctors Without Borders / M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), The International Islamic Relief Organization (IR), and The International Organization for Migration (IOM).[11] In cooperation with the UNHCR he has made illegal migration among the top priorities of the organization[12][13][14] along with handling refugees cases in partnership with (UNRWA).[15] The intervention in Libya On March 17, 2011.\n\n== Libyan issue ==\nthe UN Security Council passed Resolution 1973, spearheaded by the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama, authorizing military intervention in Libya. On 19 March 2011, a multi-state NATO-led coalition began a military intervention in Libya. The military operations began, with American and British naval forces firing over 110 Tomahawk cruise missiles,the French Air Force, British Royal Air Force, and Royal Canadian Air Force undertaking sorties across Libya and a naval blockade by Coalition forces. French jets launched air strikes against Libyan Army tanks and vehicles.\n\nThe intervention in Libya in 2011 was claimed to have been a triumph, More than seven years after the intervention it has shown that the way a coalition of NATO and other states implemented resolution 1973 was not in accordance with that resolution and therefore violated international law. Libya has become one of the largest black market arms suppliers in the world, and by far the largest supplier to Daesh \u201c ISIS\u201d in the region, since the Western under nato\u2019s intervention in 2011. More importantly, it is a cautionary tale of the West's failed adventurism.\n\n[https://www.voltairenet.org/article170713.html The Sorman Massacre] On June 20, 2011 at 2.30 am NATO warplanes bombed the residential house of General [https://www.voltairenet.org/article170713.html El-Khweldi El-Hamedi in Sorman]- Libya where Where Khaled El Hamedi and his family lived, the building that was served as the home to the El Hamedi family was turned into rubble, killing 13 people of El-Hamedi\u2019s family, the wife of Khaled El Hamedi Safae azwai and his two little children Khaleda and Alkhweldi, his little niece Salam, his Aunt Najia, his cousin Mohamed, his neighbors children and workers at his family\u2019s home eerie all killed in the attack.\n\nThere are numerous victims in Libya, but Khaled\u2019s family has a special situation. The house was bombed after a telephone call between the French president Sarkozy and General El-Khweldi El-Hamedi offering the general the presidency of Libya as a deal if he agrees to step out from the regime and stand against Gaddafi\nOn June 21, 2011,NATO-spokesperson Wing Commander Mike Bracken declared that the attack aimed a communication centre, that precision bombs were used to avoid damage or harm caused to civilians. He also declared that the target was chosen after extensive intelligence collection, observation and reconnaissance.\n\nIndependent observers who visited the site later did not find any evidence of any military and/or communication equipment being present. In a communication on February 15, 2012 to the President of the Commission of Inquiry on Libya (COIL), installed later by the United Nations Human Rights Council, NATO\u2019s legal advisor M. Peter Olson states on the contrary that NATO did not have any reliable source of information on the ground but remains convinced that the home of General El-Khweldi El-Hamedi and his son Khaled was a legitimate target. The UN COIL found these explanations insufficient and concluded that NATO had not provided the necessary information to allow the Commission of Inquiry to examine whether the bombing of the family home was compatible with the laws of war and especially with international humanitarian law.\n\nThe team used a report from NATO intelligence analysts who determined that General El-Khweldi El-Hamedi Khaled\u2018s father, one of the original members of the 1969 AlFateh Revolutionary Command Council was living on the property, and his assassination had been ordered by NATO because they hoped to weaken the regime in some way specially after he rejected the Sarkozy offer to him.\nAfter the death his family and the collapse of Tripoli Khaled and his remaining A-life family left Libya , he accused by the rebels and the formed National transactional council and the governing members of Muslim brotherhood of leading troops and participating in killing civilians , which all were fabricated accusations to allow them to go after [[:ar:\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0648\u064a\u0644\u062f\u064a_\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f_\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0645\u064a\u062f\u064a|El-Khweldi El-Hamedi]] and his son Khaled and request their arrest to claim victory In doing so in-front of their supporters to cover for their failure and claim victory by bringing honorable people to their fake justice and failure system of justice leaving the country in a big mess managed by the strongest rebel of weapon holders and smugglers, this never came to reality as the honorable history of General El-Khweldi El-Hamedi alone is good enough to proof all their accusations wrong\nU.N ended mandate for NATO operations in Libya\nThe [https://g.co/kgs/MoNs3v U.N.

NATO declined the jurisdiction of the Belgian Courts and invoked the immunity granted in the 1951 Otawa agreement that established NATO. The Belgian government however decided to intervene in the case to speak on behalf of NATO. In October 2012 the Court of First Instance upheld NATO\u2019s immunity and dismissed the demand of Khaled El Hamedi. The latter appealed for the accountability in line with both national and international laws, In particular the immunity of NATO is in violation of the right of access to a Court, enshrined i.a. in the European Human Rights Convention and other international human rights and instruments.\n\nThe Belgian Court of Cassation decided that immunity of international organisations can be waived if the latter don\u2019t set up an internal mechanism accessible for citizens who suffered harm as a result of the actions undertaken by the organisation. NATO does not have such mechanism in relation to its actions in Libya.\n\nUnfortunately, the Brussels Court of Appeal decided on November 23, 2017 to uphold the immunity of NATO missing thus a historic opportunity to make a big leap forward in the enforcement of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. The Brussels Court of Appeal decide that the immunity granted to NATO was an acceptable restriction of the right to access to a Court.

The military operations began, with American and British naval forces firing over 110 Tomahawk cruise missiles,the French Air Force, British Royal Air Force, and Royal Canadian Air Force undertaking sorties across Libya and a naval blockade by Coalition forces. French jets launched air strikes against Libyan Army tanks and vehicles.\n\nThe intervention in Libya in 2011 was claimed to have been a triumph, More than seven years after the intervention it has shown that the way a coalition of NATO and other states implemented resolution 1973 was not in accordance with that resolution and therefore violated international law.

The military fortification was used by the [[British Army]], and the [[Canadian militia]] for most of the 19th century, and by the militia in the 20th century, until 1923, when the property was handed over to the Dominion Parks Commission, the predecessor to [[Parks Canada]]. The fort was earlier named a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] on January 1920.<ref name=nhs>{{cite web|url=https://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=7618|title=Fort Wellington National Historic Site of Canada|publisher=Parks Canada|year=2019|work=HistoricPlaces.ca|accessdate=22 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nBuilt in the midst of the [[War of 1812]], the British commissioned the construction of the fortification in 1813 to protect the head of the Gallop Rapids in the St. Lawrence. Completed in 1814, the fort was abandoned by the British shortly after the war, although it formally remained the property of the British [[Board of Ordnance]]. The British commissioned the construction of a new fort, on top of the earthwork of the first fort in 1838, during the onset of the [[Rebellions of 1837\u20131838]]. Completed in 1839, the fort was used by the British Army, and the [[Canadian Militia]]. \n\nThe fort was used by the British until 1863, when British units left the area, making the militia the fort's sole occupant. The militia continued to use the fort until 1923, when it handed over the property to the Dominion Parks Branch, the predecessor to [[Parks Canada]]. As a National Historic Site, Fort Wellington operates as a historical [[open-air museum]].\n\n==Location==\n[[File:The breakwater and lighthouse - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|View of [[Prescott, Ontario|Prescott]]'s shoreline looking east towards the Galop Rapids. Fort Wellington was built to protect the head of the Galop Rapids.]]\nFort Wellington was commissioned by the [[British Empire|British]] government during [[War of 1812|the War of 1812]] to protect the head of the Galop Rapids in the St. Lawrence River. Prior to the creation of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway|St. Lawrence Seaway]] in the 1950s, a series of rapids ran downriver from Prescott to [[Montreal]].  Shipping of freight and passengers on regular lake ships was impossible through these rapids, and so freight and passengers who travelled downriver to Prescott from [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] would be \"forwarded\" to smaller bateaux which could travel through the rapids. Likewise, freight travelling upriver from Montreal would be unloaded from smaller bateaux and loaded onto larger lake ships for carriage upriver.  At the time, the [[Rideau Canal]] had not been constructed and the colony's road network was primitive.  The only means of shipping heavy cargo and passengers into the [[Great Lakes]] from the lower St. Lawrence was by way of Prescott.\n\nSince Prescott is located only a mile from the town of [[Ogdensburg, New York]], it was especially vulnerable to military action by the [[United States Army]].  As a communications hub upon which the rest of the colony of [[Upper Canada]] relied, the town had to be defended. The fort was built on land owned by Major [[Edward Jessup]], a prominent Loyalist from Connecticut who founded Prescott in 1784.\n\n==History==\n===Initial construction and the War of 1812===\nThe fort was built with earthen [[Rampart (fortification)|ramparts]] reinforced with horizontal frieze pickets. The ramparts were surrounded on the east, west and south facades by a dry ditch with a vertical [[palisade]] fence and a [[glacis]].  A masonry gate on the north facade of the fort was the only entryway. Inside the fort, timber buildings were constructed and designed to be concealed behind the ramparts. [[Casemate]]s were tunnelled into the inside of the ramparts and these were used for storage.\n\nThe fort's main armament was a pair of [[24-pounder long gun|24-pounder iron cannon]] mounted on the southeast and southwest corners of the ramparts. These guns had a range which permitted them to fire on buildings across the river in [[Ogdensburg, New York]], and consequently any ship or boat passing the fort was (and is) within range of these guns.  Smaller guns defended other points on the ramparts walls.\n[[File:DSC 6319 - Fire, smoke and death. (2800907387).jpg|thumb|left|[[Historical reenactment|Historical reenactors]] depicting a War of 1812 era skirmish at Fort Wellington.]]\nUnusually for a fortification of its age in Ontario, Fort Wellington was never directly attacked. During the War of 1812, Prescott remained an important communications point. Fort Wellington served as the rallying point for the local militia, and in early 1813 was also a base of operations for members of the [[Glengarry Light Infantry]] under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Macdonell. On February 22, 1813, Macdonell led the approximately 500 men under his command in a drill exercise on the frozen St. Lawrence River.<ref name=taylor273>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Alan|title=The Civil War of 1812: American Citizens, British Subjects, Irish Rebels, & Indian Allies|year=2010|publisher=Alfred A.

Knopf|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4000-4265-4|pages=271\u2013272}}</ref>\n\nThe fort's guns and garrison again saw action in November, when an [[United States|American]] army under [[James Wilkinson|General Wilkinson]] descended the St. Lawrence River in an attempt to capture Montreal. Wilkinson feared Fort Wellington's guns enough that he unloaded his army upriver from Ogdensburg and marched it through the town at night while his boats slipped past, empty of passengers.\n\nOnce Wilkinson passed Ogdensburg, Prescott's garrison followed along the King's Highway (the modern [[Highway 2 (Ontario)|Highway 2]]) along the north shore of the river. On November 11, 1813, the two armies fought the [[Battle of Crysler's Farm]], near present-day [[Morrisburg, Ontario]]. Wilkinson's army was decisively defeated by a much smaller British and [[Canada|Canadian]] force, and retreated across the River to [[Fort Covington, New York]]. The attack on Montreal was abandoned, and Canada saved.\n\nThe fortifications were completed in 1814, coinciding with the peace negotiations which resulted in the [[Treaty of Ghent]]. Following the war, the garrison was reduced due to lack of necessity during peacetime. Gradually, the fortifications were allowed to deteriorate, and the fort was abandoned by the British army in 1833.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fort Wellington National Historic Site of Canada&nbsp;\u2014 Natural Wonders & Cultural Treasures&nbsp;\u2014 History|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/lhn-nhs/on/wellington/natcul.aspx|publisher=Parks Canada|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Abandonment===\nThe end of the War of 1812 in December 1814 led to a rapid demobilization of British fortications in [[Upper Canada]]. Fort Wellington was quickly abandoned, although the land itself remained the property of the [[Board of Ordnance]] of the [[British monarchy|British Crown]]. Built quickly, the buildings and casemates inside the fort deteriorated.\n\n===Construction of the second fort===\n[[File:12 pounder and carronade.jpg|thumb|A 12-pounder gun was placed at the northwest corner over the main gate of the fort in 1839.]]\nIn 1837, political [[dissident]]s in [[the Canadas]] launched a [[Rebellions of 1837\u20131838|rebellion]], including at the [[York, Upper Canada|City of York]] (modern [[Toronto]]). With few British regular soldiers in the Colony, the Upper Canadian [[militia]] was quickly mobilized and Fort Wellington became the main depot for the militia in the Prescott area. The Crown commissioned a reconstruction of the fort using the original earthworks from 1813, and work commenced in the spring of 1838.\n\nThe buildings in the modern Fort Wellington survive from this period.  The three-storey stone [[blockhouse]] was completed in 1839, as was the officer's quarters, latrine, cookhouse, and guardhouse. The 1839 improvements were in response to [[Hunters' Lodges]] seizure of the [[Steamship|steamer]] ''Sir Robert Peel''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/lhn-nhs/on/windmill/natcul.aspx |title=Parks Canada&nbsp;\u2014 Battle of the Windmill National Historic Site&nbsp;\u2014 Natural Wonders & Cultural Treasures |publisher=Pc.gc.ca |date=2012-03-02 |accessdate=2012-07-06}}</ref> The original 24-pounder cannon first installed in 1813 were remounted on the southeast and southwest corners of the ramparts, as were two 12-pounder cannon on the northeast and northwest corners, a 36-pounder [[carronade]] over the gate, and two 14-inch [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]] on the parade behind the southern rampart facade. In addition, an enclosed, stone [[caponier]]e was constructed in the dry ditch outside the palisade on the south facade. This was accessed through a tunnel from the interior of the fort.\n\n=== Battle of the Windmill ===\n{{main|Battle of the Windmill}}\nAfter their defeat at York in the autumn of 1837, many of the Upper Canadian political dissidents fled to the United States. Among the citizens of the northern states of [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Ohio]] and [[Michigan]], these exiles found much sympathy and anti-British sentiment. Overnight, an army of sympathizers was organized. Calling themselves [[Hunter Patriots]], they combined a [[Freemasonry|neo-Masonic]] organizational structure with militant [[republicanism]]. Their [[propaganda]] machine convinced many Americans in the northern states that the citizens of Upper and [[Lower Canada]] were being oppressed by undemocratic British government, and were simply waiting for the intervention of liberty-loving American sympathizers.\n\nEarly in 1838, these hunters conducted insurgent operations in the [[Regional Municipality of Niagara, Ontario|Niagara Region]], the area around [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and [[Amherstburg, Ontario|Amherstburg]], Ontario and on [[Pelee, Ontario|Pelee Island]]. At one point, [[Navy Island]], upriver from [[Niagara Falls]], which was and remains Canadian territory, was occupied by a sizeable army of Patriot Hunters.\n\nTensions escalated when a force of Upper Canada militia seized a Hunter vessel, ''[[Caroline Affair|Caroline]]'', in the [[Niagara River]] and burned it. Although officially opposed to the actions of the Patriot Hunters, the United States government soon found that most of its local agents and officials were either themselves members of the Lodges or complicit in their activities. For example, the New York State militia \"lost\" several cannons from its armouries in New York State and Michigan.\n\nIn November, 1838, a force of Patriot Hunters met at [[Sackets Harbor, New York]] and then travelled downriver on civilian vessels to Ogdensburg. They planned to seize the militia strongpoint at Fort Wellington and organize the disaffected citizens of Upper Canada into a Patriot-led insurgent army with the goal of deposing the British Governor of the Colony.\n\nThe Patriots' attempt to land at Prescott proved farcical. The local militia commander had been warned that trouble was afoot. When a Hunter vessel attempted to land early on the morning of 12 November at a wharf in Prescott, it was challenged and fired upon by alert Canadian militiamen.  Attempting to withdraw, it and a companion vessel ran aground off Ogdensburg. Later in the morning, both vessels were freed and drifted downriver, past the incredulous sentries at Fort Wellington, and landed two miles downriver at Windmill Point, a promontory on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River.  Windmill Point was the site of a hamlet called Newport and\u2014most prominently\u2014a tall, stone windmill. The Hunters disembarked and occupied the village and windmill.  Their commanding officer returned by ship to Ogdensburg, promising that a larger force of Hunters would be embarked there and brought as reinforcements.  He left a Swedish immigrant named [[Nils von Schoultz]] in command at the windmill.\n\nWith no regular British forces in the area, the local commander of the Upper Canadian militia summoned all available militiamen in Grenville, Leeds and Dundas Counties and began preparations to assault.  He established a cordon of militiamen around Newport and Windmill Point.  He also opened communications with the American military commander at Ogdensburg, who had arrived on the scene and had begun to restore order in that town.\n\nA small American naval vessel arrived to cooperate with an even smaller British naval vessel, HMSV ''Experiment'', in isolating Windmill Point from reinforcement.  During the course of this blockade, a civilian vessel, ''United States'', commandeered by the Hunters attempted to run the blockade and was fired on by ''Experiment''. In what may have been the last naval action on the St. Lawrence River, the helmsman of the Patriot Hunter vessel was decapitated by a British cannonball, and the Hunters withdrew into Ogdensburg Harbour, where their vessel was interned.\n\nMeanwhile, sufficient numbers of militia and a small party of British regulars had arrived in Prescott to allow an assault on Windmill Point, and this was attempted on 13 November.  The militia were successful in driving in the Patriot outposts and capturing many of the outlying farm buildings, but the Hunters held the windmill and some of the surrounding buildings.  Casualties on both sides had been significant, and the British commander elected to await regular reinforcements.  He reestablished the cordon around the Point while the main body of militia withdrew to Fort Wellington.\n\nRegular reinforcements arrived on 14 November in the form of British regulars of the [[Royal Artillery]] and the 83rd Regiment as well as [[Royal Marines]] from the [[Royal Navy]] facility at [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]].  Having appreciated that the windmill structure would be impervious to small arms and light artillery fire, heavy artillery was brought by ship from Kingston.  A detachment of Highlanders from the 93rd Regiment arrived from Montreal just at the second assault was about to begin on 16 November.  More small naval gunboats also arrived to shell the Hunters from the River while the [[United States Navy]] kept the rest of the Hunters bottled up on the American side.\n\nDuring the second assault, the Hunters were quickly driven from the outlying buildings in Newport and forced back into the windmill itself.  The heavy artillery opened fire against this building, but were unable to penetrate the thick stone walls.  Nonetheless, Von Schoultz and his men now realized that the Upper Canadians were not going to join the insurgency and that the promised reinforcements from Ogdensburg had more pressing matters to attend to safely across the border.  Surrounded by wounded men, running short of supplies, ammunition and food, Von Schoultz surrendered unconditionally.  The survivors were taken to [[Fort Henry, Ontario|Fort Henry]] in Kingston, where they were tried.  Von Schoultz and several others were convicted and hanged, while the rest were either pardoned or transported to Australia.\n\n=== 1839 to 1923===\n[[File:Fort Wellington I.jpg|thumb|left|Fort Wellington in 1860.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lossing |first=Benson |title=The Pictorial Field-Book of the War of 1812 |publisher=Harper & Brothers, Publishers |year=1868 |page=584}}</ref>]]\nFort Wellington retained a regular garrison of British soldiers after the Rebellion.  Visitors today can see the Fort restored to its condition in 1846, when the garrison comprised a modest detachment of Royal Artillery and a company of riflemen from [[the Royal Canadian Rifle Regiment]].\n\nThis Regiment was composed of veterans of the [[British Army]] who volunteered to serve in the border fortifications in Canada.  Because of the close proximity of the United States, the British garrison in Canada suffered from high rates of desertion.  British deserters who could reach the United States were not deported back to Canada. The Army's solution was to only recruit veterans into the Royal Canadian Rifle Regiment, offer them a better rate of pay as well as pension benefits and the possibility of land grants upon the completion of their service.  Consistent with the Duke of Wellington's suggestion that light infantry and rifle units would be most useful in Canada, the Regiment was also raised as an elite, rifle-armed unit.\n\nThe task of the Fort's garrison was to occupy the Fort and prevent it from being seized by surprise by insurgents or other belligerents.  The Fort's main purpose was to hold the military stores of the Upper Canadian militia for the region.\n\nThe British Army left Fort Wellington in 1863, when the Fort became the sole responsibility of the militia.  It was a regular site of militia operations, and was garrisoned during the [[Fenian Raids]] of 1866.\n\nDuring the [[First World War]], the Fort was used as a depot for military personnel travelling between Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal.  Prescott was the terminus of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] line from Ottawa, and this was the point where travellers from the north joined the main railway line between Toronto and Montreal. Many Canadian soldiers on their way to Europe stayed temporarily at the Fort.\n\n=== Establishment of a National Historic Site ===\n[[File:Postcard of Fort Wellington Prescott Ontario Canada.jpg|thumb|A postcard of Fort Wellington, c. 1930, several years after it was named [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]].]]\nOn 30 January 1920, Fort Wellington was named as a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]].<ref name=nhs/> In 1923, the Fort was transferred from the Ministry of Militia to the Dominion Parks Branch, the national park service now called [[Parks Canada]].

The military fortification was used by the [[British Army]], and the [[Canadian militia]] for most of the 19th century, and by the militia in the 20th century, until 1923, when the property was handed over to the Dominion Parks Commission, the predecessor to [[Parks Canada]]. The fort was earlier named a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] on January 1920.<ref name=nhs>{{cite web|url=https://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=7618|title=Fort Wellington National Historic Site of Canada|publisher=Parks Canada|year=2019|work=HistoricPlaces.ca|accessdate=22 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nBuilt in the midst of the [[War of 1812]], the British commissioned the construction of the fortification in 1813 to protect the head of the Gallop Rapids in the St. Lawrence. Completed in 1814, the fort was abandoned by the British shortly after the war, although it formally remained the property of the British [[Board of Ordnance]]. The British commissioned the construction of a new fort, on top of the earthwork of the first fort in 1838, during the onset of the [[Rebellions of 1837\u20131838]]. Completed in 1839, the fort was used by the British Army, and the [[Canadian Militia]]. \n\nThe fort was used by the British until 1863, when British units left the area, making the militia the fort's sole occupant. The militia continued to use the fort until 1923, when it handed over the property to the Dominion Parks Branch, the predecessor to [[Parks Canada]]. As a National Historic Site, Fort Wellington operates as a historical [[open-air museum]].\n\n==Location==\n[[File:The breakwater and lighthouse - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|View of [[Prescott, Ontario|Prescott]]'s shoreline looking east towards the Galop Rapids. Fort Wellington was built to protect the head of the Galop Rapids.]]\nFort Wellington was commissioned by the [[British Empire|British]] government during [[War of 1812|the War of 1812]] to protect the head of the Galop Rapids in the St. Lawrence River. Prior to the creation of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway|St. Lawrence Seaway]] in the 1950s, a series of rapids ran downriver from Prescott to [[Montreal]].  Shipping of freight and passengers on regular lake ships was impossible through these rapids, and so freight and passengers who travelled downriver to Prescott from [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] would be \"forwarded\" to smaller bateaux which could travel through the rapids. Likewise, freight travelling upriver from Montreal would be unloaded from smaller bateaux and loaded onto larger lake ships for carriage upriver.  At the time, the [[Rideau Canal]] had not been constructed and the colony's road network was primitive.  The only means of shipping heavy cargo and passengers into the [[Great Lakes]] from the lower St. Lawrence was by way of Prescott.\n\nSince Prescott is located only a mile from the town of [[Ogdensburg, New York]], it was especially vulnerable to military action by the [[United States Army]].  As a communications hub upon which the rest of the colony of [[Upper Canada]] relied, the town had to be defended. The fort was built on land owned by Major [[Edward Jessup]], a prominent Loyalist from Connecticut who founded Prescott in 1784.\n\n==History==\n===Initial construction and the War of 1812===\nThe fort was built with earthen [[Rampart (fortification)|ramparts]] reinforced with horizontal frieze pickets. The ramparts were surrounded on the east, west and south facades by a dry ditch with a vertical [[palisade]] fence and a [[glacis]].  A masonry gate on the north facade of the fort was the only entryway. Inside the fort, timber buildings were constructed and designed to be concealed behind the ramparts. [[Casemate]]s were tunnelled into the inside of the ramparts and these were used for storage.\n\nThe fort's main armament was a pair of [[24-pounder long gun|24-pounder iron cannon]] mounted on the southeast and southwest corners of the ramparts. These guns had a range which permitted them to fire on buildings across the river in [[Ogdensburg, New York]], and consequently any ship or boat passing the fort was (and is) within range of these guns.  Smaller guns defended other points on the ramparts walls.\n[[File:DSC 6319 - Fire, smoke and death. (2800907387).jpg|thumb|left|[[Historical reenactment|Historical reenactors]] depicting a War of 1812 era skirmish at Fort Wellington.]]\nUnusually for a fortification of its age in Ontario, Fort Wellington was never directly attacked. During the War of 1812, Prescott remained an important communications point. Fort Wellington served as the rallying point for the local militia, and in early 1813 was also a base of operations for members of the [[Glengarry Light Infantry]] under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Macdonell. On February 22, 1813, Macdonell led the approximately 500 men under his command in a drill exercise on the frozen St. Lawrence River.<ref name=taylor273>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Alan|title=The Civil War of 1812: American Citizens, British Subjects, Irish Rebels, & Indian Allies|year=2010|publisher=Alfred A.

Wilkinson feared Fort Wellington's guns enough that he unloaded his army upriver from Ogdensburg and marched it through the town at night while his boats slipped past, empty of passengers.\n\nOnce Wilkinson passed Ogdensburg, Prescott's garrison followed along the King's Highway (the modern [[Highway 2 (Ontario)|Highway 2]]) along the north shore of the river. On November 11, 1813, the two armies fought the [[Battle of Crysler's Farm]], near present-day [[Morrisburg, Ontario]]. Wilkinson's army was decisively defeated by a much smaller British and [[Canada|Canadian]] force, and retreated across the River to [[Fort Covington, New York]]. The attack on Montreal was abandoned, and Canada saved.\n\nThe fortifications were completed in 1814, coinciding with the peace negotiations which resulted in the [[Treaty of Ghent]]. Following the war, the garrison was reduced due to lack of necessity during peacetime. Gradually, the fortifications were allowed to deteriorate, and the fort was abandoned by the British army in 1833.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fort Wellington National Historic Site of Canada&nbsp;\u2014 Natural Wonders & Cultural Treasures&nbsp;\u2014 History|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/lhn-nhs/on/wellington/natcul.aspx|publisher=Parks Canada|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Abandonment===\nThe end of the War of 1812 in December 1814 led to a rapid demobilization of British fortications in [[Upper Canada]]. Fort Wellington was quickly abandoned, although the land itself remained the property of the [[Board of Ordnance]] of the [[British monarchy|British Crown]]. Built quickly, the buildings and casemates inside the fort deteriorated.\n\n===Construction of the second fort===\n[[File:12 pounder and carronade.jpg|thumb|A 12-pounder gun was placed at the northwest corner over the main gate of the fort in 1839.]]\nIn 1837, political [[dissident]]s in [[the Canadas]] launched a [[Rebellions of 1837\u20131838|rebellion]], including at the [[York, Upper Canada|City of York]] (modern [[Toronto]]). With few British regular soldiers in the Colony, the Upper Canadian [[militia]] was quickly mobilized and Fort Wellington became the main depot for the militia in the Prescott area. The Crown commissioned a reconstruction of the fort using the original earthworks from 1813, and work commenced in the spring of 1838.\n\nThe buildings in the modern Fort Wellington survive from this period.  The three-storey stone [[blockhouse]] was completed in 1839, as was the officer's quarters, latrine, cookhouse, and guardhouse. The 1839 improvements were in response to [[Hunters' Lodges]] seizure of the [[Steamship|steamer]] ''Sir Robert Peel''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/lhn-nhs/on/windmill/natcul.aspx |title=Parks Canada&nbsp;\u2014 Battle of the Windmill National Historic Site&nbsp;\u2014 Natural Wonders & Cultural Treasures |publisher=Pc.gc.ca |date=2012-03-02 |accessdate=2012-07-06}}</ref> The original 24-pounder cannon first installed in 1813 were remounted on the southeast and southwest corners of the ramparts, as were two 12-pounder cannon on the northeast and northwest corners, a 36-pounder [[carronade]] over the gate, and two 14-inch [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]] on the parade behind the southern rampart facade. In addition, an enclosed, stone [[caponier]]e was constructed in the dry ditch outside the palisade on the south facade. This was accessed through a tunnel from the interior of the fort.\n\n=== Battle of the Windmill ===\n{{main|Battle of the Windmill}}\nAfter their defeat at York in the autumn of 1837, many of the Upper Canadian political dissidents fled to the United States. Among the citizens of the northern states of [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Ohio]] and [[Michigan]], these exiles found much sympathy and anti-British sentiment. Overnight, an army of sympathizers was organized. Calling themselves [[Hunter Patriots]], they combined a [[Freemasonry|neo-Masonic]] organizational structure with militant [[republicanism]]. Their [[propaganda]] machine convinced many Americans in the northern states that the citizens of Upper and [[Lower Canada]] were being oppressed by undemocratic British government, and were simply waiting for the intervention of liberty-loving American sympathizers.\n\nEarly in 1838, these hunters conducted insurgent operations in the [[Regional Municipality of Niagara, Ontario|Niagara Region]], the area around [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and [[Amherstburg, Ontario|Amherstburg]], Ontario and on [[Pelee, Ontario|Pelee Island]]. At one point, [[Navy Island]], upriver from [[Niagara Falls]], which was and remains Canadian territory, was occupied by a sizeable army of Patriot Hunters.\n\nTensions escalated when a force of Upper Canada militia seized a Hunter vessel, ''[[Caroline Affair|Caroline]]'', in the [[Niagara River]] and burned it. Although officially opposed to the actions of the Patriot Hunters, the United States government soon found that most of its local agents and officials were either themselves members of the Lodges or complicit in their activities. For example, the New York State militia \"lost\" several cannons from its armouries in New York State and Michigan.\n\nIn November, 1838, a force of Patriot Hunters met at [[Sackets Harbor, New York]] and then travelled downriver on civilian vessels to Ogdensburg. They planned to seize the militia strongpoint at Fort Wellington and organize the disaffected citizens of Upper Canada into a Patriot-led insurgent army with the goal of deposing the British Governor of the Colony.\n\nThe Patriots' attempt to land at Prescott proved farcical. The local militia commander had been warned that trouble was afoot. When a Hunter vessel attempted to land early on the morning of 12 November at a wharf in Prescott, it was challenged and fired upon by alert Canadian militiamen.  Attempting to withdraw, it and a companion vessel ran aground off Ogdensburg. Later in the morning, both vessels were freed and drifted downriver, past the incredulous sentries at Fort Wellington, and landed two miles downriver at Windmill Point, a promontory on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River.  Windmill Point was the site of a hamlet called Newport and\u2014most prominently\u2014a tall, stone windmill. The Hunters disembarked and occupied the village and windmill.  Their commanding officer returned by ship to Ogdensburg, promising that a larger force of Hunters would be embarked there and brought as reinforcements.  He left a Swedish immigrant named [[Nils von Schoultz]] in command at the windmill.\n\nWith no regular British forces in the area, the local commander of the Upper Canadian militia summoned all available militiamen in Grenville, Leeds and Dundas Counties and began preparations to assault.  He established a cordon of militiamen around Newport and Windmill Point.  He also opened communications with the American military commander at Ogdensburg, who had arrived on the scene and had begun to restore order in that town.\n\nA small American naval vessel arrived to cooperate with an even smaller British naval vessel, HMSV ''Experiment'', in isolating Windmill Point from reinforcement.  During the course of this blockade, a civilian vessel, ''United States'', commandeered by the Hunters attempted to run the blockade and was fired on by ''Experiment''. In what may have been the last naval action on the St. Lawrence River, the helmsman of the Patriot Hunter vessel was decapitated by a British cannonball, and the Hunters withdrew into Ogdensburg Harbour, where their vessel was interned.\n\nMeanwhile, sufficient numbers of militia and a small party of British regulars had arrived in Prescott to allow an assault on Windmill Point, and this was attempted on 13 November.  The militia were successful in driving in the Patriot outposts and capturing many of the outlying farm buildings, but the Hunters held the windmill and some of the surrounding buildings.  Casualties on both sides had been significant, and the British commander elected to await regular reinforcements.  He reestablished the cordon around the Point while the main body of militia withdrew to Fort Wellington.\n\nRegular reinforcements arrived on 14 November in the form of British regulars of the [[Royal Artillery]] and the 83rd Regiment as well as [[Royal Marines]] from the [[Royal Navy]] facility at [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]].  Having appreciated that the windmill structure would be impervious to small arms and light artillery fire, heavy artillery was brought by ship from Kingston.  A detachment of Highlanders from the 93rd Regiment arrived from Montreal just at the second assault was about to begin on 16 November.  More small naval gunboats also arrived to shell the Hunters from the River while the [[United States Navy]] kept the rest of the Hunters bottled up on the American side.\n\nDuring the second assault, the Hunters were quickly driven from the outlying buildings in Newport and forced back into the windmill itself.  The heavy artillery opened fire against this building, but were unable to penetrate the thick stone walls.  Nonetheless, Von Schoultz and his men now realized that the Upper Canadians were not going to join the insurgency and that the promised reinforcements from Ogdensburg had more pressing matters to attend to safely across the border.  Surrounded by wounded men, running short of supplies, ammunition and food, Von Schoultz surrendered unconditionally.  The survivors were taken to [[Fort Henry, Ontario|Fort Henry]] in Kingston, where they were tried.  Von Schoultz and several others were convicted and hanged, while the rest were either pardoned or transported to Australia.\n\n=== 1839 to 1923===\n[[File:Fort Wellington I.jpg|thumb|left|Fort Wellington in 1860.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lossing |first=Benson |title=The Pictorial Field-Book of the War of 1812 |publisher=Harper & Brothers, Publishers |year=1868 |page=584}}</ref>]]\nFort Wellington retained a regular garrison of British soldiers after the Rebellion.

The series premiered in the United States on [[The CW]] on October 10, 2012, and was primarily filmed in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada. In January 2019, The CW renewed the series for a ten-episode [[Arrow (season 8)|eighth season]] announcing in March that it would be the series finale. The season premiered on October 15, 2019 and featured the \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\" crossover event; the series finale aired on January 28, 2020.\n\n''Arrow'' follows billionaire playboy [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] ([[Stephen Amell]]), who claimed to have spent five years shipwrecked on [[Lian Yu (Arrowverse location)|Lian Yu]], a mysterious island in the North China Sea, before returning home to [[Starling City]] (later renamed \"Star City\") to fight crime and corruption as a secret vigilante whose weapon of choice is a bow and arrow. Throughout the series, Oliver is joined by others, among them former soldier [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|John Diggle]] ([[David Ramsey]]), I.T. expert and skilled hacker [[Felicity Smoak (Arrowverse)|Felicity Smoak]] ([[Emily Bett Rickards]]), former assassin [[Sara Lance]] ([[Caity Lotz]]), aspiring vigilante [[Roy Harper (Arrowverse)|Roy Harper]] ([[Colton Haynes]]), Oliver's sister [[Thea Queen|Thea]] ([[Willa Holland]]), and attorney-turned-vigilante [[Laurel Lance (Arrowverse)|Laurel Lance]] ([[Katie Cassidy]]). During the first five seasons of the show, characters from Oliver's past appear in a separate story arc based on Oliver's flashbacks. Starting with season seven, a series of flash-forwards focus on Oliver's children [[William Clayton (Arrowverse)|William]] and [[Mia Smoak|Mia]], exploring how present events would affect their future and Green Arrow's legacy.\n\nThe series takes a new look at the Green Arrow character, as well as other characters from the DC Comics universe. Although [[Oliver Queen (Smallville)|Oliver Queen / Green Arrow]] had been featured in the television series ''[[Smallville]]'' from 2006 to 2011, on The CW, the producers decided to start clean and find a new actor to portray the character. ''Arrow'' has received generally positive reviews from critics. The series has received several awards and multiple nominations.\n\nIn October 2014, a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] TV series titled ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' premiered.<ref name=\"Season3Premiere\">{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/06/25/the-cw-announces-fall-premiere-dates/ |title=The CW Announces Fall Premiere Dates |work=TV by the Numbers |date=June 25, 2014 |access-date=June 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714161634/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/06/25/the-cw-announces-fall-premiere-dates/ |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> This was the first extension of the shared universe that would be known as the \"Arrowverse\".

We're so excited to reach into [the DC comics] roster and take some of these lesser-known characters that are beloved by fans, and do our spin on the characters.\"<ref name=\"GKints\" />\n\nAhead of the 100th episode, Guggenheim talked about the commitment to quality the series strives for, stating, \"We never skimped on the writing, the production or in the post-process going, 'This is going to be one of those stinkers, we might as well cut our losses and move on.' We worked as hard as we possibly can on the scripts. If episodes have come in bad, we reshoot ... Even in season 5, we have no problems with doing reshoots, or pickups, or anything we need to do to make each episode as successful as it can possibly be.\" He also noted his biggest regret in the series was \"I wish we had allowed the Oliver-Felicity storyline in season 4 to unfold at a more natural pace. We had set these tentpoles at the beginning of the season, and we were a bit too rigorous on how we hit them. That was a case where the planning overtook the storytelling. We didn't do things as naturally and as elegantly as we should have.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/11/29/arrow-100-episode-spoilers |title=Arrow boss previews Matrix-esque 100th episode |last=Abrams |first=Natalie |date=November 29, 2016 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=November 30, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201064532/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/11/29/arrow-100-episode-spoilers |archive-date=December 1, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn April 2, 2018, The CW renewed the series for a [[Arrow (season 7)|seventh season]], which premiered on October 15, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/riverdale-flash-supernatural-10-cw-renewals-1098997 |title='Riverdale,' 'Flash,' 'Supernatural' Among 10 CW Renewals |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |date=April 2, 2018 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=April 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402195748/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/riverdale-flash-supernatural-10-cw-renewals-1098997 |archive-date=April 2, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://tvline.com/2018/06/20/cw-premiere-dates-fall-2018-flash-charmed-riverdale/ |title=The CW Sets Fall Premiere Dates, Including New 'Super' Sunday |last=Swift |first=Andy |date=June 20, 2018 |work=TVLine |access-date=June 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620225706/https://tvline.com/2018/06/20/cw-premiere-dates-fall-2018-flash-charmed-riverdale/ |archive-date=June 20, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> On January 31, 2019, The CW renewed the series for an eighth season.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cw-renews-flash-charmed-riverdale-supernatural-6-more-1181714 |title=CW Renews 'The Flash,' 'Charmed,' 'Riverdale,' 'Supernatural,' 6 More |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |date=January 31, 2019 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=January 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202015411/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cw-renews-flash-charmed-riverdale-supernatural-6-more-1181714 |archive-date=February 2, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> On March 6, 2019, it was announced that it season would be the final season of the series, with an abbreviated ten-episode run.

As Oliver is embracing being a hero, being a hero means stepping out of the dark and being more of a symbol, so he has to take steps to conceal his identity more.\"<ref name=\"S2mask\"/> He added that it will \"allow the Arrow to interact with people who don't know his identity in a much more organic way than having him constantly keep his head down.\"<ref name=\"S2mask\"/>\n\nCostume designer Maya Mani put together roughly 50 mask options for the producers. Kreisberg said, \"What's so wonderful about the design that Maya came up with is that it really is very simple, and it feels as if it's been part of his costume since the beginning ... once we finally had this mask and put it on Stephen [Amell], even Stephen was like, 'This is the right one.{{' \"}}<ref name=\"S2mask\"/> In the episode \"Three Ghosts\", Oliver receives the mask from [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]], who is able to create a mask that will help conceal his identity, while still being functional and allowing Oliver to see clearly.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Three Ghosts |series=Arrow |credits=John Behring (director), Andrew Kreisberg & Geoff Johns (writers) |network=The CW |airdate=December 11, 2013 |season=2 |minutes=42}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nTo compose the score for ''Arrow'', executive producer Greg Berlanti invited [[Blake Neely]], with whom he had first worked on ''[[Everwood]]''.

''Arrow 2.5'' is intended to tell one continuous story across two arcs, that fits within the television narrative. Guggenheim stated, \"We've tried to put in all the elements that people like about the show ... We're going to see what's happened to Detective Lance after he collapsed in the season [two] finale. A good chunk of the burning questions left over will get answered in the tie-in comic. Particularly towards the latter half of the series, we're going to start introducing characters [in the comic] who you'll see in Season 3 ... before they show up on TV.\"<ref name=\"Comic2.5\" /> On the comic's relationship to season three of the show, Guggenheim said, \"Season three is designed to stand on its own feet without requiring anyone to do any outside reading. But what the comic book will give is a deeper appreciation for some of the moments [in the show] and a more complete narrative experience. If you want to go deeper into the story, that's what ''Season 2.5'' is for.\" Shimizu added that the comic also allows the writers to \"accomplish things on the page that are nearly impossible to do with our production schedule and our budget\", including bigger action sequences, as well as visits to locations such as [[Kahndaq]] that cannot be recreated on the show. Additionally, the series has one to two pages each issue dedicated to the Suicide Squad, leading up to their own issue later in the run.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/arrow-season-25-reveals-hidden-729128 |title='Arrow: Season 2.5' Reveals Hidden Story Between TV Seasons |last=McMillan |first=Graeme |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=August 29, 2014 |access-date=August 31, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831102704/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/arrow-season-25-reveals-hidden-729128 |archive-date=August 31, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> The character Caleb Green, who has ties to Robert Queen, was created specifically for the comic.<ref name=\"NerdistComic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nerdist.com/2014/09/exclusive-arrow-showrunner-marc-guggenheim-on-the-arrow-season-2-5-digital-comic/ |title=Exclusive: Arrow Showrunner Marc Guggenheim On The Arrow: Season 2.

Barrowman, who initially pitched the series to DC Comics as another with the ability to tell Merlyn's backstory, said he \"had a backstory in my head for Malcolm from the beginning and a lot of it has made its way into our comic and onto the screen. I think it's always been my job to help the audience relate to Malcolm in some way despite his questionable morals and evil ways.\" Executive producers Guggenheim and Kreisberg helped the Barrowmans ensure the story would fit within the continuity of the series.

The series premiered in the United States on [[The CW]] on October 10, 2012, and was primarily filmed in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada. In January 2019, The CW renewed the series for a ten-episode [[Arrow (season 8)|eighth season]] announcing in March that it would be the series finale. The season premiered on October 15, 2019 and featured the \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\" crossover event; the series finale aired on January 28, 2020.\n\n''Arrow'' follows billionaire playboy [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] ([[Stephen Amell]]), who claimed to have spent five years shipwrecked on [[Lian Yu (Arrowverse location)|Lian Yu]], a mysterious island in the North China Sea, before returning home to [[Starling City]] (later renamed \"Star City\") to fight crime and corruption as a secret vigilante whose weapon of choice is a bow and arrow. Throughout the series, Oliver is joined by others, among them former soldier [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|John Diggle]] ([[David Ramsey]]), I.T. expert and skilled hacker [[Felicity Smoak (Arrowverse)|Felicity Smoak]] ([[Emily Bett Rickards]]), former assassin [[Sara Lance]] ([[Caity Lotz]]), aspiring vigilante [[Roy Harper (Arrowverse)|Roy Harper]] ([[Colton Haynes]]), Oliver's sister [[Thea Queen|Thea]] ([[Willa Holland]]), and attorney-turned-vigilante [[Laurel Lance (Arrowverse)|Laurel Lance]] ([[Katie Cassidy]]). During the first five seasons of the show, characters from Oliver's past appear in a separate story arc based on Oliver's flashbacks. Starting with season seven, a series of flash-forwards focus on Oliver's children [[William Clayton (Arrowverse)|William]] and [[Mia Smoak|Mia]], exploring how present events would affect their future and Green Arrow's legacy.\n\nThe series takes a new look at the Green Arrow character, as well as other characters from the DC Comics universe. Although [[Oliver Queen (Smallville)|Oliver Queen / Green Arrow]] had been featured in the television series ''[[Smallville]]'' from 2006 to 2011, on The CW, the producers decided to start clean and find a new actor to portray the character. ''Arrow'' has received generally positive reviews from critics. The series has received several awards and multiple nominations.\n\nIn October 2014, a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] TV series titled ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' premiered.<ref name=\"Season3Premiere\">{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/06/25/the-cw-announces-fall-premiere-dates/ |title=The CW Announces Fall Premiere Dates |work=TV by the Numbers |date=June 25, 2014 |access-date=June 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714161634/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/06/25/the-cw-announces-fall-premiere-dates/ |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> This was the first extension of the shared universe that would be known as the \"Arrowverse\".

We're so excited to reach into [the DC comics] roster and take some of these lesser-known characters that are beloved by fans, and do our spin on the characters.\"<ref name=\"GKints\" />\n\nAhead of the 100th episode, Guggenheim talked about the commitment to quality the series strives for, stating, \"We never skimped on the writing, the production or in the post-process going, 'This is going to be one of those stinkers, we might as well cut our losses and move on.' We worked as hard as we possibly can on the scripts. If episodes have come in bad, we reshoot ... Even in season 5, we have no problems with doing reshoots, or pickups, or anything we need to do to make each episode as successful as it can possibly be.\" He also noted his biggest regret in the series was \"I wish we had allowed the Oliver-Felicity storyline in season 4 to unfold at a more natural pace. We had set these tentpoles at the beginning of the season, and we were a bit too rigorous on how we hit them. That was a case where the planning overtook the storytelling. We didn't do things as naturally and as elegantly as we should have.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/11/29/arrow-100-episode-spoilers |title=Arrow boss previews Matrix-esque 100th episode |last=Abrams |first=Natalie |date=November 29, 2016 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=November 30, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201064532/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/11/29/arrow-100-episode-spoilers |archive-date=December 1, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn April 2, 2018, The CW renewed the series for a [[Arrow (season 7)|seventh season]], which premiered on October 15, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/riverdale-flash-supernatural-10-cw-renewals-1098997 |title='Riverdale,' 'Flash,' 'Supernatural' Among 10 CW Renewals |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |date=April 2, 2018 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=April 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402195748/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/riverdale-flash-supernatural-10-cw-renewals-1098997 |archive-date=April 2, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://tvline.com/2018/06/20/cw-premiere-dates-fall-2018-flash-charmed-riverdale/ |title=The CW Sets Fall Premiere Dates, Including New 'Super' Sunday |last=Swift |first=Andy |date=June 20, 2018 |work=TVLine |access-date=June 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620225706/https://tvline.com/2018/06/20/cw-premiere-dates-fall-2018-flash-charmed-riverdale/ |archive-date=June 20, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> On January 31, 2019, The CW renewed the series for an eighth season.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cw-renews-flash-charmed-riverdale-supernatural-6-more-1181714 |title=CW Renews 'The Flash,' 'Charmed,' 'Riverdale,' 'Supernatural,' 6 More |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |date=January 31, 2019 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=January 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202015411/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cw-renews-flash-charmed-riverdale-supernatural-6-more-1181714 |archive-date=February 2, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> On March 6, 2019, it was announced that it season would be the final season of the series, with an abbreviated ten-episode run.

As Oliver is embracing being a hero, being a hero means stepping out of the dark and being more of a symbol, so he has to take steps to conceal his identity more.\"<ref name=\"S2mask\"/> He added that it will \"allow the Arrow to interact with people who don't know his identity in a much more organic way than having him constantly keep his head down.\"<ref name=\"S2mask\"/>\n\nCostume designer Maya Mani put together roughly 50 mask options for the producers. Kreisberg said, \"What's so wonderful about the design that Maya came up with is that it really is very simple, and it feels as if it's been part of his costume since the beginning ... once we finally had this mask and put it on Stephen [Amell], even Stephen was like, 'This is the right one.{{' \"}}<ref name=\"S2mask\"/> In the episode \"Three Ghosts\", Oliver receives the mask from [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]], who is able to create a mask that will help conceal his identity, while still being functional and allowing Oliver to see clearly.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Three Ghosts |series=Arrow |credits=John Behring (director), Andrew Kreisberg & Geoff Johns (writers) |network=The CW |airdate=December 11, 2013 |season=2 |episode=9 |minutes=42}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nTo compose the score for ''Arrow'', executive producer Greg Berlanti invited [[Blake Neely]], with whom he had first worked on ''[[Everwood]]''.

''Arrow 2.5'' is intended to tell one continuous story across two arcs, that fits within the television narrative. Guggenheim stated, \"We've tried to put in all the elements that people like about the show ... We're going to see what's happened to Detective Lance after he collapsed in the season [two] finale. A good chunk of the burning questions left over will get answered in the tie-in comic. Particularly towards the latter half of the series, we're going to start introducing characters [in the comic] who you'll see in Season 3 ... before they show up on TV.\"<ref name=\"Comic2.5\" /> On the comic's relationship to season three of the show, Guggenheim said, \"Season three is designed to stand on its own feet without requiring anyone to do any outside reading. But what the comic book will give is a deeper appreciation for some of the moments [in the show] and a more complete narrative experience. If you want to go deeper into the story, that's what ''Season 2.5'' is for.\" Shimizu added that the comic also allows the writers to \"accomplish things on the page that are nearly impossible to do with our production schedule and our budget\", including bigger action sequences, as well as visits to locations such as [[Kahndaq]] that cannot be recreated on the show. Additionally, the series has one to two pages each issue dedicated to the Suicide Squad, leading up to their own issue later in the run.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/arrow-season-25-reveals-hidden-729128 |title='Arrow: Season 2.5' Reveals Hidden Story Between TV Seasons |last=McMillan |first=Graeme |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=August 29, 2014 |access-date=August 31, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831102704/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/arrow-season-25-reveals-hidden-729128 |archive-date=August 31, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> The character Caleb Green, who has ties to Robert Queen, was created specifically for the comic.<ref name=\"NerdistComic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nerdist.com/2014/09/exclusive-arrow-showrunner-marc-guggenheim-on-the-arrow-season-2-5-digital-comic/ |title=Exclusive: Arrow Showrunner Marc Guggenheim On The Arrow: Season 2.

Barrowman, who initially pitched the series to DC Comics as another with the ability to tell Merlyn's backstory, said he \"had a backstory in my head for Malcolm from the beginning and a lot of it has made its way into our comic and onto the screen. I think it's always been my job to help the audience relate to Malcolm in some way despite his questionable morals and evil ways.\" Executive producers Guggenheim and Kreisberg helped the Barrowmans ensure the story would fit within the continuity of the series.

And how many of them can do that? They don't want to, you see. When they feel bad like this fellow here, they think they want to stop, but they don't, really.

If they do stop, out of fear or whatever, they go at once into such a state of euphoria and well-being that they become over-confident.

The conflict began on 22 June 1941 with the [[Operation Barbarossa]] offensive, when [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces crossed the borders described in the [[German\u2013Soviet Nonaggression Pact]], thereby invading the Soviet Union. The war ended on 9 May 1945, when [[Wehrmacht|Germany's armed forces]] [[Unconditional surrender|surrendered unconditionally]] following the [[Battle of Berlin]] (also known as the [[Berlin Offensive]]), a strategic operation executed by the [[Red Army]].\n\nThe states that provided forces and other resources for the German war effort included the [[Axis Powers]] \u2013 primarily Romania, Hungary, Italy, pro-Nazi Slovakia, and Croatia. [[Anti-Soviet]] Finland, which had fought the [[Winter War]] against the Soviet Union, also joined the offensive. The ''Wehrmacht'' forces were also assisted by anti-[[Communist]] [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] in places like Western Ukraine, and the [[Baltic states]].

Others say that Stalin was eager for Germany to be at war with capitalist countries.

As in the [[Sino-Soviet conflict (1929)|Sino-Soviet conflict]] on the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] or [[Soviet\u2013Japanese Border Wars|Soviet\u2013Japanese border conflicts]], Soviet troops on the western border received a directive, signed by [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] [[Semyon Timoshenko]] and [[Army General (Soviet rank)|General of the Army]] [[Georgy Zhukov]], that ordered (as demanded by Stalin): \"do not answer to any provocations\" and \"do not undertake any (offensive) actions without specific orders\" \u2013 which meant that Soviet troops could open fire only on their soil and forbade counter-attack on German soil. The German invasion therefore caught the Soviet military and civilian leadership largely by surprise.\n\nThe extent of warnings received by Stalin about a German invasion is controversial, and the claim that there was a warning that \"Germany will attack on 22 June without declaration of war\" has been dismissed as a \"popular myth\". However, some sources quoted in the articles on Soviet spies [[Richard Sorge]] and [[Willi Lehmann]], say they had sent warnings of an attack on 20 or 22 June, which were treated as \"disinformation\". The [[Lucy spy ring]] in Switzerland also sent warnings, possibly deriving from Ultra codebreaking in Britain.\n\nSoviet intelligence was fooled by German disinformation, so sent false alarms to Moscow about a German invasion in April, May and the beginning of June. Soviet intelligence reported that Germany would rather invade the USSR after the fall of the British Empire<ref>Source: L. E.

However, access to (and control of) the [[resource]]s, raw materials and production capacity required to entertain long-term goals (such as European control, German territorial expansion and the destruction of the USSR) were limited. Political demands necessitated the expansion of Germany's control of natural and human resources, industrial capacity and farmland beyond its borders (conquered territories). Germany's military production was tied to resources outside its area of control, a dynamic not found amongst the Allies.\n\nDuring the war, as Germany acquired new territories (either by direct annexation or by installing puppet governments in defeated countries), these new territories were forced to sell raw materials and agricultural products to German buyers at extremely low prices. Two-thirds of all French trains in 1941 were used to carry goods to Germany. [[Norway]] lost 20% of its national income in 1940 and 40% in 1943.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=121}} Axis allies such as [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Finland]], [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] benefited from Germany's net imports. Overall, [[Vichy France|France]] made the largest contribution to the German war effort. In 1943\u201344, French payments to Germany may have risen to as much as 55% of French GDP.<ref>[https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-history-of-the-second-world-war/economics-of-the-war-with-nazi-germany/E2F3FE2B9549A00F2E992673C5C8B28D/core-reader The economics of the war with Nazi Germany]</ref> Overall, Germany imported 20% of its food and 33% of its raw materials from conquered territories and Axis allies.<ref>https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/guides/z2932p3/revision/4</ref>\n\nOn 27 May 1940, Germany signed the \"Oil Pact\" with Romania, by which Germany would trade arms for oil. Romania's oil production amounted to approximately 6,000,000 tons annually. This production represents 35% of the total fuel production of the Axis including the synthetic products and the substitutes and 70% of the total production of crude oil.<ref>A History of Romanian Oil, Vol. II, p. 245</ref> In 1941, Germany only had 18% of the oil it had in peacetime. Romania supplied Germany and its allies with roughly 13 million barrels of oil (about 4 million per year) between 1941 and 1943.

By 17 January, the Soviets had captured Lotoshino and Shakhovskaya. By 20 January, the 5th and 33rd armies had captured Ruza, Dorokhovo, Mozhaisk and Vereya, while the 43rd and 49th armies were at Domanovo.<ref name=GeorgyZhukov/>{{rp|58\u201359}}\n\nThe Wehrmacht rallied, retaining a [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] at Rzhev. A Soviet [[Paratrooper|parachute drop]] by two battalions of the 201st Airborne Brigade and the 250th Airborne Regiment on 18 and 22 January was designed to \"cut off enemy communications with the rear.\" Lt.-Gen. [[Mikhail Grigoryevich Yefremov]]'s 33rd Army aided by Gen. Belov's 1st Cavalry Corps and [[Soviet Partisans]] attempted to seize Vyazma. This force was joined by additional paratroopers of the 8th Airborne Brigade at the end of January. However, in early February, the Germans managed to cut off this force, separating the Soviets from their main force in the rear of the Germans. They were supplied by air until April when they were given permission to regain the Soviet main lines. Only part of Belov's Cavalry Corps made it to safety however, while Yefremov's men fought \"a losing battle.\"<ref name=GeorgyZhukov/>{{rp|59\u201362}}\n\nBy April 1942, the Soviet Supreme Command agreed to assume the defensive so as to \"consolidate the captured ground.\" According to Zhukov, ''\"During the winter offensive, the forces of the Western Front had advanced from 70 to 100&nbsp;km, which somewhat improved the overall operational and strategic situation on the Western sector.\"''<ref name=GeorgyZhukov/>{{rp|64}}\n\nTo the north, the Red Army surrounded a German [[garrison]] in [[Demyansk]], which held out with air supply for four months, and established themselves in front of [[Kholm, Kholmsky District, Novgorod Oblast|Kholm]], [[Velizh]], and [[Velikie Luki]].\n\nFurther north still, the Soviet Second Shock Army was unleashed on the [[Volkhov River]]. Initially this made some progress; however, it was unsupported, and by June a German counterattack cut off and destroyed the army. The Soviet commander, Lieutenant General [[Andrey Vlasov]], later defected to Germany and formed the ROA or [[Russian Liberation Army]].\n\nIn the south the Red Army lunged over the [[Donets River]] at [[Izyum]] and drove a {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} deep salient. The intent was to pin Army Group South against the [[Sea of Azov]], but as the winter eased the Wehrmacht counter-attacked and cut off the over-extended Soviet troops in the [[Second Battle of Kharkov]].\n\n===Don, Volga, and Caucasus: Summer 1942===\n{{Main|Case Blue|Battle of Voronezh (1942)|Battle of Caucasus|Battle of Stalingrad}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}\n[[File:Eastern Front 1942-05 to 1942-11.png|thumb|[[Operation Blue]]: German advances from 7 May 1942 to 18 November 1942:\n{{legend|#fff8d5|to 7 July 1942}}\n{{legend|#ffd2b9|to 22 July 1942}}\n{{legend|#ebd7ff|to 1 August 1942}}\n{{legend|#ccffcd|to 18 November 1942}}]]\n\nAlthough plans were made to attack Moscow again, on 28 June 1942, the offensive re-opened in a different direction. Army Group South took the initiative, anchoring the front with the [[Battle of Voronezh (1942)|Battle of Voronezh]] and then following the [[Don River, Russia|Don river]] southeastwards. The grand plan was to secure the Don and [[Volga]] first and then drive into the Caucasus towards [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan|the oil fields]], but operational considerations and Hitler's vanity made him order both objectives to be attempted simultaneously. Rostov was recaptured on 24 July when the 1st Panzer Army joined in, and then that group drove south towards [[Maykop|Maikop]]. As part of this, Operation ''Shamil'' was executed, a plan whereby a group of [[Brandenburger commando]]s dressed up as Soviet [[NKVD]] troops to destabilise Maikop's defences and allow the 1st Panzer Army to enter the oil town with little opposition.\n\nMeanwhile, the 6th Army was driving towards [[Stalingrad]], for a long period unsupported by 4th Panzer Army, which had been diverted to help 1st Panzer Army cross the Don. By the time the 4th Panzer Army had rejoined the Stalingrad offensive Soviet resistance (comprising the 62nd Army under [[Vasily Chuikov]]) had stiffened. A leap across the Don brought German troops to the Volga on 23 August but for the next three months the ''Wehrmacht'' would be fighting the Battle of Stalingrad street-by-street.\n\nTowards the south, the 1st Panzer Army had reached the Caucasian foothills and the [[Malka River]]. At the end of August Romanian mountain troops joined the Caucasian spearhead, while the Romanian 3rd and 4th armies were redeployed from their successful task of clearing the Azov [[littoral]]. They took up position on either side of Stalingrad to free German troops for the main offensive. Mindful of the continuing antagonism between Axis allies Romania and [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] over [[Transylvania]], the Romanian army in the Don bend was separated from the Hungarian 2nd army by the Italian 8th Army. Thus, all of Hitler's allies were involved \u2013 including a [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovakian]] contingent with the 1st Panzer Army and a [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatian]] [[regiment]] attached to 6th Army.\n\nThe advance into the Caucasus bogged down, with the Germans unable to fight their way past [[Malgobek]] and to the main prize of [[Grozny]]. Instead, they switched the direction of their advance to approach it from the south, crossing the Malka at the end of October and entering [[North Ossetia\u2013Alania|North Ossetia]]. In the first week of November, on the outskirts of [[Vladikavkaz|Ordzhonikidze]], the 13th Panzer Division's spearhead was snipped off and the panzer troops had to fall back. The offensive into Russia was over.\n\n===Stalingrad: Winter 1942===\n{{Main|Battle of Stalingrad|Operation Little Saturn|Operation Mars|Third Battle of Kharkov|Battle for Velikiye Luki (1943)}}\n[[File:Eastern Front 1942-11 to 1943-03.png|thumb|Operations [[Operation Uranus|Uranus]], [[Operation Saturn|Saturn]] and [[Operation Mars|Mars]]: Soviet advances on the Eastern Front, 18 November 1942 to March 1943:\n{{legend|#fff8d5|to 12 December 1942}}\n{{legend|#ffd2b9|to 18 February 1943}}\n{{legend|#ccffcd|to March 1943 (Soviet gains only)}}]]\n\nWhile the German 6th and 4th Panzer Armies had been fighting their way into Stalingrad, Soviet armies had congregated on either side of the city, specifically into the Don [[bridgehead]]s, and it was from these that they struck in November 1942. In Operation ''[[Operation Uranus|Uranus]]'' started on 19 November, two Soviet fronts punched through the Romanian lines and converged at [[Kalach-na-Donu|Kalach]] on 23 November, trapping 300,000 Axis troops behind them.<ref>Shirer (1990), p.925\u2013926</ref> A simultaneous offensive on the Rzhev sector known as Operation ''[[Operation Mars|Mars]]'' was supposed to advance to Smolensk, but was a costly failure, with German tactical defences preventing any breakthrough.\n\n[[File:USSROfficerTT33.JPG|thumb|left|upright|A Soviet junior political officer ([[Political commissar|Politruk]]) urges Soviet troops forward against German positions (12 July 1942).]]\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B28822, Russland, Kampf um Stalingrad, Infanterie.jpg|thumb|German infantry and a supporting [[Sturmgesch\u00fctz III|StuG III]] assault gun during the advance towards Stalingrad, September 1942]]\n\nThe Germans rushed to transfer troops to the Soviet Union in a desperate attempt to relieve Stalingrad, but the offensive could not get going until 12 December, by which time the 6th Army in Stalingrad was starving and too weak to break out towards it. [[Operation Wintergewitter|Operation Winter Storm]], with three transferred panzer divisions, got going briskly from [[Kotelnikovo]] towards the Aksai river but became bogged down {{convert|65|km|mi|abbr=on}} short of its goal. To divert the rescue attempt, the Red Army decided to smash the Italians and come down behind the relief attempt if they could; that operation starting on 16 December. What it did accomplish was to destroy many of the aircraft that had been transporting relief supplies to Stalingrad. The fairly limited scope of the Soviet offensive, although still eventually targeted on Rostov, also allowed Hitler time to see sense and pull Army Group A out of the Caucasus and back over the Don.<ref>Shirer (1990), p.927\u2013928</ref>\n\nOn 31 January 1943, the 90,000 survivors of the 300,000-man 6th Army surrendered. By that time the Hungarian 2nd Army had also been wiped out. The Red Army advanced from the Don {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the west of Stalingrad, marching through Kursk (retaken on 8 February 1943) and Kharkov (retaken 16 February 1943). To save the position in the south, the Germans decided to abandon the Rzhev salient in February, freeing enough troops to make a successful [[riposte]] in eastern Ukraine. [[Manstein]]'s counteroffensive, strengthened by a specially trained [[II SS Panzer Corps|SS Panzer Corps]] equipped with [[Tiger I|Tiger tanks]], opened on 20 February 1943 and fought its way from [[Poltava]] [[Third Battle of Kharkov|back into Kharkov]] in the third week of March, when the spring thaw intervened.This left a glaring Soviet bulge ([[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]]) in the front centered on Kursk.\n\n===Kursk: Summer 1943===\n{{Main|Battle of Kursk}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}\n[[File:RIAN archive 997 Soldiers and a gun on the road.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Soviet soldiers and 45mm gun on the road, 1 August 1943]]\n[[File:Eastern Front 1943-02 to 1943-08.png|thumb|German advances at [[Third Battle of Kharkov|Kharkov]] and [[Battle of Kursk|Kursk]], 19 February 1943 to 1 August 1943:\n{{legend|#ffd2b9|to 18 March 1943}}\n{{legend|#ccffcd|to 1 August 1943}}]]\n\nAfter the failure of the attempt to capture Stalingrad, Hitler had delegated planning authority for the upcoming campaign season to the [[German Army High Command]] and reinstated [[Heinz Guderian]] to a prominent role, this time as Inspector of Panzer Troops. Debate among the General Staff was polarised, with even Hitler nervous about any attempt to pinch off the Kursk salient. He knew that in the intervening six months the Soviet position at Kursk had been reinforced heavily with [[anti-tank]] guns, [[tank trap]]s, [[land mine|landmines]], [[barbed wire]], [[trench warfare|trenches]], [[Bunker#Pillbox|pillboxes]], [[artillery]] and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]].<ref name=\"Mastny 1365\u20131388\">{{cite journal\n | last =Mastny\n | first =Vojtech\n | author-link =Vojtech Mastny\n | title =Stalin and the Prospects of a Separate Peace in World War II\n | journal =[[The American Historical Review]]\n | volume =77\n | issue =5\n | pages =1365\u20131388\n | date =December 1972\n | url =https://archive.org/details/MastnystalinAndProspectsOfSeparatePeaceInWorld\n | jstor =1861311\n  | doi =10.2307/1861311\n }}</ref>\n\nHowever, if one last great ''[[blitzkrieg]]'' offensive could be mounted, then attention could then be turned to the Allied threat to the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]]. Certainly, the peace negotiations in April had gone nowhere.<ref name=\"Mastny 1365\u20131388\"/> The advance would be executed from the Orel salient to the north of Kursk and from [[Belgorod]] to the south. Both wings would converge on the area east of Kursk, and by that means restore the lines of [[Army Group South]] to the exact points that it held over the winter of 1941\u20131942.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Merz-014-12A, Russland, Beginn Unternehmen Zitadelle, Panzer.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Prokhorovka]] was one of the largest tank battles ever fought. It was part of the wider [[Battle of Kursk]].|alt=]]\n\nIn the north, the entire [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 9th Army]] had been redeployed from the Rzhev salient into the Orel salient and was to advance from Maloarkhangelsk to Kursk. But its forces could not even get past the first objective at [[Olkhovatka]], just {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} into the advance. The 9th Army blunted its spearhead against the Soviet [[land mine|minefields]], frustratingly so considering that the high ground there was the only natural barrier between them and flat tank country all the way to Kursk. The direction of advance was then switched to [[Ponyri]], to the west of Olkhovatka, but the 9th Army could not break through here either and went over to the defensive. The Red Army then launched a counter-offensive, [[Operation Kutuzov]].\n\nOn 12 July the Red Army battled through the demarcation line between the 211th and 293rd divisions on the [[Zhizdra River]] and steamed towards [[Karachev]], right behind them and behind Orel. The southern offensive, spearheaded by [[German 4th Panzer Army|4th Panzer Army]], led by Gen. Col. [[Hermann Hoth|Hoth]], with three Tank Corps made more headway. Advancing on either side of the upper Donets on a narrow corridor, the [[II SS Panzer Corps]] and the [[Grossdeutschland Division|Gro\u00dfdeutschland Panzergrenadier divisions]] battled their way through minefields and over comparatively high ground towards [[Oboyan]]. Stiff resistance caused a change of direction from east to west of the front, but the tanks got {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} before encountering the reserves of the [[Soviet 5th Guards Tank Army]] outside [[Prokhorovka]]. Battle was joined on 12 July, with about one thousand tanks being engaged.\n\nAfter the war, the battle near Prochorovka was idealised by Soviet [[historian]]s as the largest tank battle of all time. The [[meeting engagement]] at Prochorovka was a Soviet defensive success, albeit at heavy cost. The Soviet 5th Guards Tank Army, with about 800 light and medium tanks, attacked elements of the II SS Panzer Corps. Tank losses on both sides have been the source of controversy ever since. Although the 5th Guards Tank Army did not attain its objectives, the German advance had been halted.\n\nAt the end of the day both sides had fought each other to a standstill, but regardless of the German failure in the north [[Erich von Manstein]] proposed he continue the attack with the 4th Panzer Army. The Red Army started the strong offensive operation in the northern Orel salient and achieved a breakthrough on the flank of the German 9th Army. Also worried by the Allies' [[Operation Husky|landing in Sicily]] on 10 July, Hitler made the decision to halt the offensive even as the German 9th Army was rapidly giving ground in the north. The Germans' final strategic offensive in the Soviet Union ended with their defence against a major Soviet counteroffensive that lasted into August.\n\nThe Kursk offensive was the last on the scale of 1940 and 1941 that the ''Wehrmacht'' was able to launch; subsequent offensives would represent only a shadow of previous German offensive might.\n\n===Autumn and Winter 1943\u201344===\n{{Main|Battle of the Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket|Battle of Smolensk (1943)|Lower Dnieper Offensive|Dnieper-Carpathian Offensive|Leningrad\u2013Novgorod Offensive|Battle of Narva (1944)}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2015}}\n[[File:BM 13 TBiU 7.jpg|thumb|upright|\"[[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]]\" \u2013 a notable Soviet rocket launcher]]\nThe Soviet multi-stage summer offensive started with the advance into the Orel salient. The diversion of the well-equipped ''Gro\u00dfdeutschland Division'' from Belgorod to Karachev could not counteract it, and the Wehrmacht began a withdrawal from Orel (retaken by the Red Army on 5 August 1943), falling back to the Hagen line in front of [[Bryansk]]. To the south, the Red Army broke through Army Group South's Belgorod positions and headed for Kharkov once again. Although intense battles of movement throughout late July and into August 1943 saw the [[Tiger I|Tigers]] blunting Soviet tank attacks on one axis, they were soon outflanked on another line to the west as the Soviet forces advanced down the [[Olshanka|Psel]], and Kharkov was abandoned for the final time on 22 August.\n\nThe German forces on the [[Mius]], now comprising the 1st Panzer Army and a reconstituted 6th Army, were by August too weak to repulse a Soviet attack on their own front, and when the Red Army hit them they retreated all the way through the [[Donbass]] industrial region to the Dnieper, losing half the farmland that Germany had invaded the Soviet Union to exploit. At this time Hitler agreed to a general withdrawal to the Dnieper line, along which was meant to be the ''Ostwall'', a line of defence similar to the [[Westwall#Reactivation of the Siegfried Line, 1944|Westwall]] (Siegfried Line) of fortifications along the German frontier in the west.\n\nThe main problem for the Wehrmacht was that these defences had not yet been built; by the time Army Group South had evacuated eastern Ukraine and begun withdrawing across the Dnieper during September, the Soviet forces were hard behind them. Tenaciously, small units paddled their way across the {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide river and established [[bridgehead]]s. A second attempt by the Red Army to gain land using parachutists, mounted at [[Kaniv]] on 24 September, proved as disappointing as at Dorogobuzh eighteen months previously. The paratroopers were soon repelled \u2013 but not until still more Red Army troops had used the cover they provided to get themselves over the Dnieper and securely dug in.\n\n[[File:Roza Shanina.jpg|thumb|upright|Soviet sniper [[Roza Shanina]] in 1944.

Important Dnieper towns started to fall, with [[Zaporozhye]] the first to go, followed by [[Dnepropetrovsk]]. Finally, early in November the Red Army broke out of its bridgeheads on either side of Kiev and captured the Ukrainian capital, at that time the third largest city in the Soviet Union.\n\nEighty miles west of Kiev, the 4th Panzer Army, still convinced that the Red Army was a spent force, was able to mount a successful riposte at [[Zhytomyr]] during the middle of November, weakening the Soviet bridgehead by a daring outflanking strike mounted by the SS Panzer Corps along the river Teterev. This battle also enabled Army Group South to recapture Korosten and gain some time to rest. However, on [[Christmas Eve]] the retreat began anew when the First Ukrainian Front (renamed from the Voronezh Front) struck them in the same place. The Soviet advance continued along the railway line until the 1939 Polish\u2013Soviet border was reached on 3 January 1944.\n\nTo the south, the Second Ukrainian Front (ex [[Steppe Front]]) had crossed the Dnieper at [[Kremenchug]] and continued westwards. In the second week of January 1944 they swung north, meeting Vatutin's tank forces which had swung south from their penetration into Poland and surrounding ten German divisions at Korsun\u2013Shevchenkovsky, west of [[Korsun\u2013Shevchenkovsky Offensive|Cherkassy]]. Hitler's insistence on holding the Dnieper line, even when facing the prospect of catastrophic defeat, was compounded by his conviction that the Cherkassy pocket could break out and even advance to Kiev, but Manstein was more concerned about being able to advance to the edge of the pocket and then implore the surrounded forces to break out.\n\nBy 16 February the first stage was complete, with panzers separated from the contracting Cherkassy pocket only by the swollen Gniloy Tikich river. Under shellfire and pursued by Soviet tanks, the surrounded German troops, among whom were the [[SS Division (motorised) Wiking|5th SS Panzer Division ''Wiking'']], fought their way across the river to safety, although at the cost of half their number and all their equipment. They assumed the Red Army would not attack again, with the spring approaching, but on 3 March the Soviet Ukrainian Front went over to the offensive. Having already isolated the Crimea by severing the [[Isthmus of Perekop|Perekop isthmus]], Malinovsky's forces advanced across the mud to the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] border, not stopping on the river [[Prut]].\n\n[[File:Eastern Front 1943-08 to 1944-12.png|thumb|Soviet advances from 1 August 1943 to 31 December 1944: {{legend|#fff8d5|to 1 December 1943}} {{legend|#ffd2b9|to 30 April 1944}} {{legend|#ebd7ff|to 19 August 1944}} {{legend|#ccffcd|to 31 December 1944}}]]\nOne final move in the south completed the 1943\u201344 campaigning season, which had wrapped up a Soviet advance of over 500 miles. In March, 20 German divisions of ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Hans-Valentin Hube]]'s [[1st Panzer Army]] were encircled in what was to be known as [[Kamenets-Podolsky pocket|Hube's Pocket]] near Kamenets-Podolskiy. After two weeks' of heavy fighting, the 1st Panzer managed to escape the pocket, at the cost of losing almost the entire heavy equipment. At this point, Hitler sacked several prominent generals, Manstein included. In April, the Red Army took back [[Odessa]], followed by 4th Ukrainian Front's campaign to restore control over the Crimea, which culminated in the capture of [[Sevastopol]] on 10 May.\n\nAlong Army Group Centre's front, August 1943 saw this force pushed back from the Hagen line slowly, ceding comparatively little territory, but the loss of Bryansk, and more importantly Smolensk, on 25 September cost the ''Wehrmacht'' the keystone of the entire German defensive system. The 4th and 9th armies and 3rd Panzer Army still held their own east of the upper Dnieper, stifling Soviet attempts to reach Vitebsk. On Army Group North's front, there was barely any fighting at all until January 1944, when out of nowhere Volkhov and Second Baltic Fronts struck.<ref name=\"glantz\"/>\n\nIn a lightning campaign, the Germans were pushed back from Leningrad and [[Novgorod]] was captured by Soviet forces. After a 75-mile advance in January and February, the Leningrad Front had reached the borders of Estonia.

Accordingly, they stripped troops from Army Group Centre, whose front still protruded deep into the Soviet Union. The Germans had transferred some units to France to counter the [[invasion of Normandy]] two weeks before. The Belorussian Offensive (codenamed [[Operation Bagration]]), which was agreed upon by Allies at the [[Tehran Conference]] in December 1943 and launched on 22 June 1944, was a massive Soviet attack, consisting of four Soviet army groups totalling over 120 divisions that smashed into a thinly held German line.\n\nThey focused their massive attacks on Army Group Centre, not Army Group North Ukraine as the Germans had originally expected. More than 2.3 million Soviet troops went into action against German Army Group Centre, which had a strength of fewer than 800,000 men. At the points of attack, the numerical and quality advantages of the Soviet forces were overwhelming. The Red Army achieved a ratio of ten to one in tanks and seven to one in aircraft over their enemy. The Germans crumbled. The capital of [[Belarus]], [[Minsk]], was taken on 3 July, trapping some 100,000 Germans. Ten days later the Red Army reached the prewar Polish border. ''Bagration'' was, by any measure, one of the largest single operations of the war.\n\nBy the end of August 1944, it had cost the Germans ~400,000 dead, wounded, missing and sick, from whom 160,000 were captured, as well as 2,000 tanks and 57,000 other vehicles.

The attack breached the Finnish front line of defence in Valkeasaari on 10 June and the Finnish forces retreated to their secondary defence line, the [[VT-line]]. The Soviet attack was supported by a heavy artillery barrage, air bombardments and armoured forces.

The Soviets outnumbered the Germans on average by 5\u20136:1 in troops, 6:1 in artillery, 6:1 in tanks and 4:1 in [[self-propelled artillery]]. After four days the Red Army broke out and started moving thirty to forty kilometres a day, taking the Baltic states, [[Danzig]], [[East Prussia]], [[Pozna\u0144]], and drawing up on a line sixty kilometres east of [[Berlin]] along the River [[Oder]].

The distinctly brutal nature of warfare on the Eastern Front was exemplified by an often wilful disregard for human life by both sides.

Stalin and Hitler both disregarded human life in order to achieve their goal of victory. This included the terrorisation of their own people, as well as [[mass deportation]]s of entire populations.

Behind the front lines, [[wikt:atrocity|atrocities]] against civilians in German-occupied areas were routine, including those carried out as part of the Holocaust. German and German-allied forces treated civilian populations with exceptional brutality, massacring whole village populations and routinely killing civilian hostages (see [[German war crimes]]). Both sides practised widespread [[scorched earth]] tactics, but the loss of civilian lives in the case of Germany was incomparably smaller than that of the Soviet Union, in which at least 20 million were killed. According to British historian [[Geoffrey Hosking]], \"The full demographic loss to the Soviet peoples was even greater: since a high proportion of those killed were young men of child-begetting age, the postwar Soviet population was 45 to 50 million smaller than post-1939 projections would have led one to expect.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Hosking|first=Geoffrey A.|title=Rulers and Victims: The Russians in the Soviet Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDMVMqDvp4QC&pg=PA242|year=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02178-5|page=242}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Red Army invaded Germany in 1944, many German civilians suffered from reprisals by Red Army soldiers (see [[Soviet war crimes]]). After the war, following the [[Yalta conference]] agreements between the Allies, the [[German people|German populations]] of [[East Prussia]] and [[Silesia]] were [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u20131950)|displaced to the west]] of the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]], in what became one of the largest [[forced migration]]s of people in world history.\n\nThe Soviet Union came out of World War II militarily victorious but economically and structurally devastated. Much of the combat took place in or close to populated areas, and the actions of both sides contributed to massive loss of civilian life and tremendous material damage. According to a summary, presented by Lieutenant General [[Roman Rudenko]] at the [[Nuremberg Trials|International Military Tribunal]] in [[Nuremberg]], the property damage in the Soviet Union inflicted by the Axis invasion was estimated to a value of 679 billion rubles. The largest number of civilian deaths in a single city was 1.2 million citizens dead during the [[Siege of Leningrad]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 February 1946, Volume 95, Number 32158.</ref>\n\nThe combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710 cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850 industrial establishments, 40,000 miles of railroad, 4,100 railroad stations, 40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000 public libraries; leaving 25 million homeless. Seven million horses, 17 million cattle, 20 million pigs, 27 million sheep were also slaughtered or driven off.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Wild fauna were also affected. Wolves and foxes fleeing westward from the killing zone, as the Soviet army advanced between 1943 and 1945, were responsible for a [[rabies]] epidemic that spread slowly westwards, reaching the coast of the [[English Channel]] by 1968.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|2007|pp=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\n==Leadership==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}\nThe Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were both ideologically driven states (by [[Soviet communism]] and by [[Nazism]] respectively), in which the foremost political [[leader]]s had [[Totalitarianism|near-absolute power]]. The character of the war was thus determined by the political leaders and their [[ideology]] to a much greater extent than in any other theatre of World War II.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Adolf Hitler===\n{{Main|Adolf Hitler}}\n[[File:Adolf Hitler cropped restored.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Adolf Hitler]] led Germany during World War II.]]\n\nAdolf Hitler exercised tight control over the German war-effort, spending much of his time in his command bunkers (most notably at [[Rastenburg]] in [[East Prussia]], at [[Vinnitsa]] in [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]], and under the garden of the [[Reich Chancellery]] in [[Berlin]]). At crucial periods in the war he held daily situation-conferences at which he used his remarkable talent for public speaking to overwhelm opposition from his generals and from the OKW staff with rhetoric.\n\nIn part because of the unexpected degree of German success in the Battle of France (despite the warnings of the professional military) Hitler believed himself a military genius, with a grasp of the total war-effort that eluded his generals. In August 1941, when [[Walther von Brauchitsch]] (commander-in-chief of the ''Wehrmacht'') and [[Fedor von Bock]] appealed for an attack on Moscow, Hitler instead ordered the encirclement and capture of Ukraine, in order to acquire the farmland, industry, and natural resources of that country. Some historians like Bevin Alexander in ''How Hitler Could Have Won'' regard this decision as a missed opportunity to win the war.\n\nIn the winter of 1941\u20131942 Hitler believed that his obstinate refusal to allow the German armies to retreat had saved Army Group Centre from collapse. He later told [[Erhard Milch]]:\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B24543, Hauptquartier Heeresgruppe S\u00fcd, Lagebesprechung.jpg|thumb|Hitler with generals [[Friedrich Paulus]], [[Adolf Heusinger]] and [[Fedor von Bock]] in Poltawa, German-occupied Ukraine, June 1942]]\n\n<blockquote>\nI had to act ruthlessly. I had to send even my closest generals packing, two army generals, for example \u2026 I could only tell these gentlemen, \"Get yourself back to Germany as rapidly as you can \u2013 but leave the army in my charge. And the army is staying at the front.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nThe success of this [[hedgehog defence]] outside Moscow led Hitler to insist on the holding of territory when it made no military sense, and to sack generals who retreated without orders. Officers with initiative were replaced with yes-men or with fanatical Nazis. The disastrous encirclements later in the war \u2013 at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], [[Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket|Korsun]] and many other places \u2013 resulted directly from Hitler's orders. This idea of holding territory led to another failed plan, dubbed{{by whom|date=May 2018}} \"''Heaven-bound Missions''\", which involved fortifying even the most unimportant or insignificant of cities and the holding of these \"fortresses\" at all costs. Many divisions became cut off in \"fortress\" cities, or wasted uselessly in secondary theatres, because Hitler would not sanction retreat or voluntarily abandon any of his conquests.\n\nFrustration at Hitler's [[leadership]] in the war was one of the factors in the attempted [[coup d'etat]] of 1944, but after the failure of the [[20 July Plot]] Hitler considered the army and its officer corps suspect and came to rely on the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) and Nazi party members to prosecute the war.\n\nHitler's direction of the war ultimately proved disastrous for the German Army, though the skill, loyalty, professionalism and endurance of officers and soldiers enabled him to keep Germany fighting to the end. [[F. W. Winterbotham]] wrote of Hitler's signal to [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] to continue the attack to the west during the [[Battle of the Bulge]]:\n\n{{quote|From experience we had learned that when Hitler started refusing to do what the generals recommended, things started to go wrong, and this was to be no exception.}}\n\n===Joseph Stalin===\n{{Main|Joseph Stalin}}\n[[File:CroppedStalin1943.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Stalin]] led the Soviet Union during World War II.]]\n\nJoseph Stalin bore the greatest responsibility for some of the disasters at the beginning of the war (for example, the [[Battle of Kiev (1941)]]), but equally deserves praise for the subsequent success of the Soviet [[Red Army]], which depended on the unprecedentedly [[History of the Soviet Union (1927\u20131953)|rapid industrialisation of the Soviet Union]], which Stalin's internal policy had made the first priority throughout the 1930s.\nStalin's [[Great Purge]] of the Red Army in the late 1930s involved the legal prosecution of many of the senior command, many of whom the courts convicted and sentenced to death or to imprisonment.\n\nThe executed included [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], a proponent of armoured [[blitzkrieg]]. Stalin promoted some [[obscurantist]]s like [[Grigory Kulik]] who opposed the mechanisation of the army and the production of tanks, but on the other hand purged the older commanders who had held their positions since the [[Russian Civil War]] of 1917\u20131922, and who had experience, but were deemed \"politically unreliable\". This opened up their places to the promotion of many younger officers that Stalin and the [[NKVD]] regarded as in line with [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] politics. Many{{quantify|date=May 2018}} of these newly promoted commanders proved terribly inexperienced, but some later became very successful. Soviet tank-output remained the largest in the world.\n\nFrom the foundation of the Red Army in 1918, political distrust of the military had led to a system of \"dual command\", with every commander paired with a [[political commissar]], a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. Larger units had military councils consisting of the commander, commissar and chief of staff \u2013 commissars ensured the loyalty of the commanding officers and implemented Party orders.\n\nFollowing the [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|Soviet occupation of eastern Poland]], of the [[Occupation and annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union (1940)|Baltic states]] and of [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]] in 1939\u20131940, Stalin insisted on the occupation of every fold of the newly Sovietized territories; this move westward positioned troops far from their depots, in salients that left them vulnerable to encirclement. As tension heightened in spring, 1941, Stalin desperately tried not to give Hitler any provocation that Berlin could use as an excuse for a German attack; Stalin refused to allow the military to go on the alert \u2013 even as German troops gathered on the borders and German reconnaissance planes overflew installations. This refusal to take necessary action was instrumental in the destruction of major portions of the Red Air Force, lined up on its airfields, in the first days of the German-Soviet war.\n\nAt the crisis of the war, in the autumn of 1942, Stalin made many concessions to the army: the government restored unitary command by removing the Commissars from the [[chain of command]]. Order 25 of 15 January 1943 introduced [[Shoulder mark|shoulderboards]] for all ranks; this represented a significant symbolic step, since after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] shoulderboards had connotations as a symbol of the old Tsarist r\u00e9gime. Beginning in autumn 1941, units that had proved themselves by superior performance in combat were given the traditional \"Guards\" title.{{Sfn | Glantz | 2005 | p = 181}}\n\nThese concessions were combined with ruthless discipline: [[Order No. 227]], issued on 28 July 1942, threatened commanders who retreated without orders with punishment by [[court-martial]]. Infractions by military and ''[[politruk]]s'' were punished with transferral to [[penal battalion]]s and to penal [[Company (military unit)|companies]] which carried out especially hazardous duties, such as serving as ''tramplers'' to clear Nazi minefields.<ref>{{Citation | last = Toppe | first = Alfred | title = Night Combat | publisher = Diane | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-7881-7080-5 | page = 28}}</ref> The order stipulated to capture or shoot \"cowards\" and fleeing panicked troops at the rear the blocking detachments in the first three months shot 1,000 penal troops and sent 24,993 to penal battalions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Stalin's Wars: From World War to Cold War, 1939\u20131953|last=Roberts|first=Geoffrey|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2006|isbn=0-300-11204-1|pages=132}}</ref> By October 1942 the idea of regular blocking detachments was quietly dropped, By 29 October 1944 the units were officially disbanded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bdsa.ru/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B7%D1%8B-%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%BE-%D0%B7%D0%B0-1944-%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B4/784-636|title=\u041f\u0420\u0418\u041a\u0410\u0417 \u041e \u0420\u0410\u0421\u0424\u041e\u0420\u041c\u0418\u0420\u041e\u0412\u0410\u041d\u0418\u0418 \u041e\u0422\u0414\u0415\u041b\u042c\u041d\u042b\u0425 \u0417\u0410\u0413\u0420\u0410\u0414\u0418\u0422\u0415\u041b\u042c\u041d\u042b\u0425 \u041e\u0422\u0420\u042f\u0414\u041e\u0412|website=bdsa.ru|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Ivan's War: Life and Death in the Red Army|last=Merridale|first=Catherine|publisher=New York : Metropolitan Books|year=2006|isbn=0-8050-7455-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ivanswarlifedeat00merr_0/page/158 158]|oclc=60671899|url=https://archive.org/details/ivanswarlifedeat00merr_0/page/158}}</ref>\n\nAs it became clear that the Soviet Union would win the war, Stalin ensured that propaganda always mentioned his leadership of the war; he sidelined the victorious generals and never allowed them to develop into political rivals.

For the majority of people of the Soviet Union, the Nazi invasion was viewed as a brutal act of unprovoked aggression. While it is important to note that not all parts of Soviet society viewed the German advance in this way, the majority of the Soviet population viewed German forces as occupiers. In areas such as [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]] (which had been annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940) the ''Wehrmacht'' was tolerated by a relatively more significant part of the native population.\n\nThis was particularly true for the territories of Western Ukraine, recently rejoined to the Soviet Union, where the anti-Polish and anti-Soviet [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|Ukrainian nationalist underground]] hoped in vain to establish the \"independent state\", relying on German armed force. However, Soviet society as a whole was hostile to the invading Nazis from the very start. The nascent national liberation movements among Ukrainians and [[Cossack]]s, and others were viewed by Hitler with suspicion; some, especially those from the Baltic States, were co-opted into the Axis armies and others brutally suppressed. None of the conquered territories gained any measure of self-rule.\n\nInstead, the [[Nazism|Nazi ideologues]] saw the future of the East as one of settlement by German colonists, with the natives killed, expelled, or reduced to slave labour. The cruel and brutally inhumane treatment of Soviet civilians, women, children and elderly, the daily bombings of civilian cities and towns, Nazi pillaging of Soviet villages and hamlets and unprecedented harsh punishment and treatment of civilians in general were some of the primary reasons for Soviet resistance to Nazi Germany's invasion. Indeed, the Soviets viewed Germany's invasion as an act of aggression and an attempt to conquer and enslave the local population.\n\n[[File:Einsatzgruppen murder Jews in Ivanhorod, Ukraine, 1942.jpg|link=Ivanhorod Einsatzgruppen photograph, 1942|thumb|[[Ivanhorod Einsatzgruppen photograph|Einsatzgruppen murdering Jews]] in [[Ivanhorod]], Ukraine, 1942]]\nRegions closer to the front were managed by military powers of the region, in other areas such as the Baltic states annexed by the USSR in 1940, Reichscommissariats were established. As a rule, the maximum in loot was extracted. In September 1941, [[Erich Koch]] was appointed to the Ukrainian Commissariat. His opening speech was clear about German policy: \"I am known as a brutal dog ... Our job is to suck from Ukraine all the goods we can get hold of ... I am expecting from you the utmost severity towards the native population.\"\n\nAtrocities against the Jewish population in the conquered areas began almost immediately, with the dispatch of ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' (task groups) to round up Jews and shoot them.<ref>[http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/barbarossa/ Marking 70 Years to Operation Barbarossa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916093736/http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/barbarossa/ |date=16 September 2012 }} on the [[Yad Vashem]] website</ref>\n\nThe massacres of Jews and other [[Ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]] were only a part of the deaths from the Nazi occupation. Many hundreds of thousands of Soviet civilians were executed, and millions more died from [[starvation]] as the Germans requisitioned food for their armies and fodder for their draft horses. As they retreated from Ukraine and Belarus in 1943\u201344, the German occupiers systematically applied a [[scorched earth]] policy, burning towns and cities, destroying infrastructure, and leaving civilians to starve or die of exposure.<ref>On 7 September 1943, [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] sent orders to [[HSSPF]] \"Ukraine\" [[Hans-Adolf Pr\u00fctzmann]] that \"not a human being, not a single head of cattle, not a hundredweight of cereals and not a railway line remain behind; that not a house remains standing, not a mine is available which is not destroyed for years to come, that there is not a well which is not poisoned. The enemy must really find completely burned and destroyed land\". He ordered cooperation with Infantry general Staff, also someone named Stampf, and sent copies to the Chief of Regular Police, Chief of Security Police & SS, [[SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]] Berger, and the chief of the partisan combating units. See ''Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression, Supplement A'' pg 1270.</ref> In many towns, the battles were fought within towns and cities with trapped civilians caught in the middle. Estimates of total civilian dead in the Soviet Union in the war range from seven million (''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'') to seventeen million (Richard Overy).\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-031-2436-03A, Russland, Hinrichtung von Partisanen.jpg|thumb|[[Soviet partisans]] hanged by German forces in January 1943]]\nThe Nazi ideology and the maltreatment of the local population and Soviet POWs encouraged [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] fighting behind the front; it motivated even anti-communists or non-Russian nationalists to ally with the Soviets and greatly delayed the formation of German-allied divisions consisting of Soviet POWs (see [[Vlasov army]]).

Immediately after the start of the German invasion, the [[NKVD prisoner massacres|NKVD massacred]] large numbers of inmates in most of their prisons in [[Western Belarus]] and Western Ukraine, while the remainder was to be evacuated in death marches.<ref>Robert Gellately.

Knopf|Knopf]], 2007 {{ISBN|1-4000-4005-1}} p. 391</ref>\n\n==Industrial output==\nThe Soviet victory owed a great deal to the ability of its war industry to outperform the German economy, despite the enormous loss of population and land. Stalin's [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plans]] of the 1930s had resulted in the industrialisation of the Urals and central Asia. In 1941, thousands of trains evacuated critical factories and workers from Belarus and Ukraine to safe areas far from the front lines. Once these facilities were reassembled east of the Urals, production could be resumed without fear of German bombing.\n\nAs the Soviet Union's manpower reserves ran low from 1943 onwards, the great Soviet offensives had to depend more on equipment and less on the expenditure of lives.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} The increases in production of [[materiel]] were achieved at the expense of civilian living standards \u2013 the most thorough application of the principle of [[total war]] \u2013 and with the help of [[Lend-Lease]] supplies from the United Kingdom and the United States. The Germans, on the other hand, could rely on a large slave workforce from the conquered countries and Soviet POWs. American exports and technical expertise also enabled the Soviets to produce goods that they wouldn't have been able to on their own. For example, while the USSR was able to produce fuel of octane numbers from 70 to 74, Soviet industry only met 4% of demand for fuel of octane numbers from 90+; all aircraft produced after 1939 required fuel of the latter category. To fulfill demands, the USSR depended on American assistance, both in finished products and TEL.<ref>Alexander Matveichuk.

Consumption on all fronts during the same period was 1.493 million tons of explosives and 626,887 tons of powder.<ref>US Strategic Bombing Survey \"Appendix D. Strategic Air Attack on the Powder and Explosives Industries\", Table D7: German Monthly Production of Powders and Exploders (Including Extenders) and Consumption by German Armed Forces</ref> From 1941\u20131945, the USSR produced only 505,000 tons of explosives and received 105,000 tons of Lend-Lease imports.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Germany outproduced the Soviet Union 3.16 to 1 in explosives tonnage.\n\nSoviet armoured fighting vehicle production was greater than the Germans (in 1943, the [[Soviet armored fighting vehicle production during World War II|Soviet Union manufactured 24,089 tanks and self-propelled guns]] to [[German armored fighting vehicle production during World War II|Germany's 19,800]]). The Soviets incrementally upgraded existing designs, and simplified and refined manufacturing processes to increase production, and were helped by a mass infusion of harder to produce goods such as aviation fuel, machine tools, trucks, and high-explosives from Lend-Lease, allowing them to concentrate on a few key industries. Meanwhile, Germany had been cut off from foreign trade for years by the time it invaded the USSR, was in the middle of two extended and costly theatres at air and sea that further limited production ([[Battle of the Atlantic]] and [[Defence of the Reich]]), and was forced to devote a large segment of its expenditures to goods the Soviets could cut back on (such as trucks) or which would never even be used against the Soviets (such as ships). Naval vessels alone constituted 10\u201315% of Germany's war expenditures from 1940 to 1944 depending on the year, while armoured vehicles by comparison were only 5\u20138%.<ref>Military Analysis Division, U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey- European War, Volume 3, page 144.

As in the [[Sino-Soviet conflict (1929)|Sino-Soviet conflict]] on the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] or [[Soviet\u2013Japanese Border Wars|Soviet\u2013Japanese border conflicts]], Soviet troops on the western border received a directive, signed by [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] [[Semyon Timoshenko]] and [[Army General (Soviet rank)|General of the Army]] [[Georgy Zhukov]], that ordered (as demanded by Stalin): \"do not answer to any provocations\" and \"do not undertake any (offensive) actions without specific orders\" \u2013 which meant that Soviet troops could open fire only on their soil and forbade counter-attack on German soil. The German invasion therefore caught the Soviet military and civilian leadership largely by surprise.\n\nThe extent of warnings received by Stalin about a German invasion is controversial, and the claim that there was a warning that \"Germany will attack on 22 June without declaration of war\" has been dismissed as a \"popular myth\". However, some sources quoted in the articles on Soviet spies [[Richard Sorge]] and [[Willi Lehmann]], say they had sent warnings of an attack on 20 or 22 June, which were treated as \"disinformation\". The [[Lucy spy ring]] in Switzerland also sent warnings, possibly deriving from Ultra codebreaking in Britain.\n\nSoviet intelligence was fooled by German disinformation, so sent false alarms to Moscow about a German invasion in April, May and the beginning of June. Soviet intelligence reported that Germany would rather invade the USSR after the fall of the British Empire<ref>Source: L. E.

In addition to Germany, hundreds of thousands of tons of bombs were dropped on their eastern allies of [[Bombing of Romania in World War II|Romania]] and [[Strategic bombing during World War II#Allied bombing statistics 1939\u201345|Hungary]], [[Operation Tidal Wave|primarily in an attempt to cripple Romanian oil production]].\n\nBritish and Commonwealth forces also contributed directly to the fighting on the Eastern Front through their service in the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoys]] and [[No. 151 Wing RAF|training Red Air Force pilots]], as well as in the provision of early material and intelligence support.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+Allied shipments to the Soviet Union<ref>Hans-Adolf Jacobsen: ''1939\u20131945, Der Zweite Weltkrieg in Chronik und Dokumenten''.

However, access to (and control of) the [[resource]]s, raw materials and production capacity required to entertain long-term goals (such as European control, German territorial expansion and the destruction of the USSR) were limited. Political demands necessitated the expansion of Germany's control of natural and human resources, industrial capacity and farmland beyond its borders (conquered territories). Germany's military production was tied to resources outside its area of control, a dynamic not found amongst the Allies.\n\nDuring the war, as Germany acquired new territories (either by direct annexation or by installing puppet governments in defeated countries), these new territories were forced to sell raw materials and agricultural products to German buyers at extremely low prices. Two-thirds of all French trains in 1941 were used to carry goods to Germany. [[Norway]] lost 20% of its national income in 1940 and 40% in 1943.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=121}} Axis allies such as [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Finland]], [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] benefited from Germany's net imports. Overall, [[Vichy France|France]] made the largest contribution to the German war effort.

Romania's oil production amounted to approximately 6,000,000 tons annually.

[[Mikhail Grigoryevich Yefremov]]'s 33rd Army aided by Gen. Belov's 1st Cavalry Corps and [[Soviet Partisans]] attempted to seize Vyazma. This force was joined by additional paratroopers of the 8th Airborne Brigade at the end of January. However, in early February, the Germans managed to cut off this force, separating the Soviets from their main force in the rear of the Germans. They were supplied by air until April when they were given permission to regain the Soviet main lines. Only part of Belov's Cavalry Corps made it to safety however, while Yefremov's men fought \"a losing battle.\"<ref name=GeorgyZhukov/>{{rp|59\u201362}}\n\nBy April 1942, the Soviet Supreme Command agreed to assume the defensive so as to \"consolidate the captured ground.\" According to Zhukov, ''\"During the winter offensive, the forces of the Western Front had advanced from 70 to 100&nbsp;km, which somewhat improved the overall operational and strategic situation on the Western sector.\"''<ref name=GeorgyZhukov/>{{rp|64}}\n\nTo the north, the Red Army surrounded a German [[garrison]] in [[Demyansk]], which held out with air supply for four months, and established themselves in front of [[Kholm, Kholmsky District, Novgorod Oblast|Kholm]], [[Velizh]], and [[Velikie Luki]].\n\nFurther north still, the Soviet Second Shock Army was unleashed on the [[Volkhov River]]. Initially this made some progress; however, it was unsupported, and by June a German counterattack cut off and destroyed the army. The Soviet commander, Lieutenant General [[Andrey Vlasov]], later defected to Germany and formed the ROA or [[Russian Liberation Army]].\n\nIn the south the Red Army lunged over the [[Donets River]] at [[Izyum]] and drove a {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} deep salient. The intent was to pin Army Group South against the [[Sea of Azov]], but as the winter eased the Wehrmacht counter-attacked and cut off the over-extended Soviet troops in the [[Second Battle of Kharkov]].\n\n===Don, Volga, and Caucasus: Summer 1942===\n{{Main|Case Blue|Battle of Voronezh (1942)|Battle of Caucasus|Battle of Stalingrad}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}\n[[File:Eastern Front 1942-05 to 1942-11.png|thumb|[[Operation Blue]]: German advances from 7 May 1942 to 18 November 1942:\n{{legend|#fff8d5|to 7 July 1942}}\n{{legend|#ffd2b9|to 22 July 1942}}\n{{legend|#ebd7ff|to 1 August 1942}}\n{{legend|#ccffcd|to 18 November 1942}}]]\n\nAlthough plans were made to attack Moscow again, on 28 June 1942, the offensive re-opened in a different direction. Army Group South took the initiative, anchoring the front with the [[Battle of Voronezh (1942)|Battle of Voronezh]] and then following the [[Don River, Russia|Don river]] southeastwards. The grand plan was to secure the Don and [[Volga]] first and then drive into the Caucasus towards [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan|the oil fields]], but operational considerations and Hitler's vanity made him order both objectives to be attempted simultaneously. Rostov was recaptured on 24 July when the 1st Panzer Army joined in, and then that group drove south towards [[Maykop|Maikop]]. As part of this, Operation ''Shamil'' was executed, a plan whereby a group of [[Brandenburger commando]]s dressed up as Soviet [[NKVD]] troops to destabilise Maikop's defences and allow the 1st Panzer Army to enter the oil town with little opposition.\n\nMeanwhile, the 6th Army was driving towards [[Stalingrad]], for a long period unsupported by 4th Panzer Army, which had been diverted to help 1st Panzer Army cross the Don. By the time the 4th Panzer Army had rejoined the Stalingrad offensive Soviet resistance (comprising the 62nd Army under [[Vasily Chuikov]]) had stiffened. A leap across the Don brought German troops to the Volga on 23 August but for the next three months the ''Wehrmacht'' would be fighting the Battle of Stalingrad street-by-street.\n\nTowards the south, the 1st Panzer Army had reached the Caucasian foothills and the [[Malka River]]. At the end of August Romanian mountain troops joined the Caucasian spearhead, while the Romanian 3rd and 4th armies were redeployed from their successful task of clearing the Azov [[littoral]]. They took up position on either side of Stalingrad to free German troops for the main offensive. Mindful of the continuing antagonism between Axis allies Romania and [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] over [[Transylvania]], the Romanian army in the Don bend was separated from the Hungarian 2nd army by the Italian 8th Army. Thus, all of Hitler's allies were involved \u2013 including a [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovakian]] contingent with the 1st Panzer Army and a [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatian]] [[regiment]] attached to 6th Army.\n\nThe advance into the Caucasus bogged down, with the Germans unable to fight their way past [[Malgobek]] and to the main prize of [[Grozny]]. Instead, they switched the direction of their advance to approach it from the south, crossing the Malka at the end of October and entering [[North Ossetia\u2013Alania|North Ossetia]]. In the first week of November, on the outskirts of [[Vladikavkaz|Ordzhonikidze]], the 13th Panzer Division's spearhead was snipped off and the panzer troops had to fall back. The offensive into Russia was over.\n\n===Stalingrad: Winter 1942===\n{{Main|Battle of Stalingrad|Operation Little Saturn|Operation Mars|Third Battle of Kharkov|Battle for Velikiye Luki (1943)}}\n[[File:Eastern Front 1942-11 to 1943-03.png|thumb|Operations [[Operation Uranus|Uranus]], [[Operation Saturn|Saturn]] and [[Operation Mars|Mars]]: Soviet advances on the Eastern Front, 18 November 1942 to March 1943:\n{{legend|#fff8d5|to 12 December 1942}}\n{{legend|#ffd2b9|to 18 February 1943}}\n{{legend|#ccffcd|to March 1943 (Soviet gains only)}}]]\n\nWhile the German 6th and 4th Panzer Armies had been fighting their way into Stalingrad, Soviet armies had congregated on either side of the city, specifically into the Don [[bridgehead]]s, and it was from these that they struck in November 1942. In Operation ''[[Operation Uranus|Uranus]]'' started on 19 November, two Soviet fronts punched through the Romanian lines and converged at [[Kalach-na-Donu|Kalach]] on 23 November, trapping 300,000 Axis troops behind them.<ref>Shirer (1990), p.925\u2013926</ref> A simultaneous offensive on the Rzhev sector known as Operation ''[[Operation Mars|Mars]]'' was supposed to advance to Smolensk, but was a costly failure, with German tactical defences preventing any breakthrough.\n\n[[File:USSROfficerTT33.JPG|thumb|left|upright|A Soviet junior political officer ([[Political commissar|Politruk]]) urges Soviet troops forward against German positions (12 July 1942).]]\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B28822, Russland, Kampf um Stalingrad, Infanterie.jpg|thumb|German infantry and a supporting [[Sturmgesch\u00fctz III|StuG III]] assault gun during the advance towards Stalingrad, September 1942]]\n\nThe Germans rushed to transfer troops to the Soviet Union in a desperate attempt to relieve Stalingrad, but the offensive could not get going until 12 December, by which time the 6th Army in Stalingrad was starving and too weak to break out towards it. [[Operation Wintergewitter|Operation Winter Storm]], with three transferred panzer divisions, got going briskly from [[Kotelnikovo]] towards the Aksai river but became bogged down {{convert|65|km|mi|abbr=on}} short of its goal. To divert the rescue attempt, the Red Army decided to smash the Italians and come down behind the relief attempt if they could; that operation starting on 16 December. What it did accomplish was to destroy many of the aircraft that had been transporting relief supplies to Stalingrad. The fairly limited scope of the Soviet offensive, although still eventually targeted on Rostov, also allowed Hitler time to see sense and pull Army Group A out of the Caucasus and back over the Don.<ref>Shirer (1990), p.927\u2013928</ref>\n\nOn 31 January 1943, the 90,000 survivors of the 300,000-man 6th Army surrendered. By that time the Hungarian 2nd Army had also been wiped out. The Red Army advanced from the Don {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the west of Stalingrad, marching through Kursk (retaken on 8 February 1943) and Kharkov (retaken 16 February 1943). To save the position in the south, the Germans decided to abandon the Rzhev salient in February, freeing enough troops to make a successful [[riposte]] in eastern Ukraine. [[Manstein]]'s counteroffensive, strengthened by a specially trained [[II SS Panzer Corps|SS Panzer Corps]] equipped with [[Tiger I|Tiger tanks]], opened on 20 February 1943 and fought its way from [[Poltava]] [[Third Battle of Kharkov|back into Kharkov]] in the third week of March, when the spring thaw intervened.This left a glaring Soviet bulge ([[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]]) in the front centered on Kursk.\n\n===Kursk: Summer 1943===\n{{Main|Battle of Kursk}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}\n[[File:RIAN archive 997 Soldiers and a gun on the road.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Soviet soldiers and 45mm gun on the road, 1 August 1943]]\n[[File:Eastern Front 1943-02 to 1943-08.png|thumb|German advances at [[Third Battle of Kharkov|Kharkov]] and [[Battle of Kursk|Kursk]], 19 February 1943 to 1 August 1943:\n{{legend|#ffd2b9|to 18 March 1943}}\n{{legend|#ccffcd|to 1 August 1943}}]]\n\nAfter the failure of the attempt to capture Stalingrad, Hitler had delegated planning authority for the upcoming campaign season to the [[German Army High Command]] and reinstated [[Heinz Guderian]] to a prominent role, this time as Inspector of Panzer Troops. Debate among the General Staff was polarised, with even Hitler nervous about any attempt to pinch off the Kursk salient. He knew that in the intervening six months the Soviet position at Kursk had been reinforced heavily with [[anti-tank]] guns, [[tank trap]]s, [[land mine|landmines]], [[barbed wire]], [[trench warfare|trenches]], [[Bunker#Pillbox|pillboxes]], [[artillery]] and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]].<ref name=\"Mastny 1365\u20131388\">{{cite journal\n | last =Mastny\n | first =Vojtech\n | author-link =Vojtech Mastny\n | title =Stalin and the Prospects of a Separate Peace in World War II\n | journal =[[The American Historical Review]]\n | volume =77\n | issue =5\n | pages =1365\u20131388\n | date =December 1972\n | url =https://archive.org/details/MastnystalinAndProspectsOfSeparatePeaceInWorld\n | jstor =1861311\n  | doi =10.2307/1861311\n }}</ref>\n\nHowever, if one last great ''[[blitzkrieg]]'' offensive could be mounted, then attention could then be turned to the Allied threat to the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]].

The 9th Army blunted its spearhead against the Soviet [[land mine|minefields]], frustratingly so considering that the high ground there was the only natural barrier between them and flat tank country all the way to Kursk. The direction of advance was then switched to [[Ponyri]], to the west of Olkhovatka, but the 9th Army could not break through here either and went over to the defensive. The Red Army then launched a counter-offensive, [[Operation Kutuzov]].\n\nOn 12 July the Red Army battled through the demarcation line between the 211th and 293rd divisions on the [[Zhizdra River]] and steamed towards [[Karachev]], right behind them and behind Orel. The southern offensive, spearheaded by [[German 4th Panzer Army|4th Panzer Army]], led by Gen. Col. [[Hermann Hoth|Hoth]], with three Tank Corps made more headway. Advancing on either side of the upper Donets on a narrow corridor, the [[II SS Panzer Corps]] and the [[Grossdeutschland Division|Gro\u00dfdeutschland Panzergrenadier divisions]] battled their way through minefields and over comparatively high ground towards [[Oboyan]]. Stiff resistance caused a change of direction from east to west of the front, but the tanks got {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} before encountering the reserves of the [[Soviet 5th Guards Tank Army]] outside [[Prokhorovka]]. Battle was joined on 12 July, with about one thousand tanks being engaged.\n\nAfter the war, the battle near Prochorovka was idealised by Soviet [[historian]]s as the largest tank battle of all time. The [[meeting engagement]] at Prochorovka was a Soviet defensive success, albeit at heavy cost. The Soviet 5th Guards Tank Army, with about 800 light and medium tanks, attacked elements of the II SS Panzer Corps. Tank losses on both sides have been the source of controversy ever since. Although the 5th Guards Tank Army did not attain its objectives, the German advance had been halted.\n\nAt the end of the day both sides had fought each other to a standstill, but regardless of the German failure in the north [[Erich von Manstein]] proposed he continue the attack with the 4th Panzer Army. The Red Army started the strong offensive operation in the northern Orel salient and achieved a breakthrough on the flank of the German 9th Army. Also worried by the Allies' [[Operation Husky|landing in Sicily]] on 10 July, Hitler made the decision to halt the offensive even as the German 9th Army was rapidly giving ground in the north. The Germans' final strategic offensive in the Soviet Union ended with their defence against a major Soviet counteroffensive that lasted into August.\n\nThe Kursk offensive was the last on the scale of 1940 and 1941 that the ''Wehrmacht'' was able to launch; subsequent offensives would represent only a shadow of previous German offensive might.\n\n===Autumn and Winter 1943\u201344===\n{{Main|Battle of the Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket|Battle of Smolensk (1943)|Lower Dnieper Offensive|Dnieper-Carpathian Offensive|Leningrad\u2013Novgorod Offensive|Battle of Narva (1944)}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2015}}\n[[File:BM 13 TBiU 7.jpg|thumb|upright|\"[[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]]\" \u2013 a notable Soviet rocket launcher]]\nThe Soviet multi-stage summer offensive started with the advance into the Orel salient. The diversion of the well-equipped ''Gro\u00dfdeutschland Division'' from Belgorod to Karachev could not counteract it, and the Wehrmacht began a withdrawal from Orel (retaken by the Red Army on 5 August 1943), falling back to the Hagen line in front of [[Bryansk]]. To the south, the Red Army broke through Army Group South's Belgorod positions and headed for Kharkov once again. Although intense battles of movement throughout late July and into August 1943 saw the [[Tiger I|Tigers]] blunting Soviet tank attacks on one axis, they were soon outflanked on another line to the west as the Soviet forces advanced down the [[Olshanka|Psel]], and Kharkov was abandoned for the final time on 22 August.\n\nThe German forces on the [[Mius]], now comprising the 1st Panzer Army and a reconstituted 6th Army, were by August too weak to repulse a Soviet attack on their own front, and when the Red Army hit them they retreated all the way through the [[Donbass]] industrial region to the Dnieper, losing half the farmland that Germany had invaded the Soviet Union to exploit. At this time Hitler agreed to a general withdrawal to the Dnieper line, along which was meant to be the ''Ostwall'', a line of defence similar to the [[Westwall#Reactivation of the Siegfried Line, 1944|Westwall]] (Siegfried Line) of fortifications along the German frontier in the west.\n\nThe main problem for the Wehrmacht was that these defences had not yet been built; by the time Army Group South had evacuated eastern Ukraine and begun withdrawing across the Dnieper during September, the Soviet forces were hard behind them. Tenaciously, small units paddled their way across the {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide river and established [[bridgehead]]s. A second attempt by the Red Army to gain land using parachutists, mounted at [[Kaniv]] on 24 September, proved as disappointing as at Dorogobuzh eighteen months previously. The paratroopers were soon repelled \u2013 but not until still more Red Army troops had used the cover they provided to get themselves over the Dnieper and securely dug in.\n\n[[File:Roza Shanina.jpg|thumb|upright|Soviet sniper [[Roza Shanina]] in 1944.

Important Dnieper towns started to fall, with [[Zaporozhye]] the first to go, followed by [[Dnepropetrovsk]]. Finally, early in November the Red Army broke out of its bridgeheads on either side of Kiev and captured the Ukrainian capital, at that time the third largest city in the Soviet Union.\n\nEighty miles west of Kiev, the 4th Panzer Army, still convinced that the Red Army was a spent force, was able to mount a successful riposte at [[Zhytomyr]] during the middle of November, weakening the Soviet bridgehead by a daring outflanking strike mounted by the SS Panzer Corps along the river Teterev. This battle also enabled Army Group South to recapture Korosten and gain some time to rest. However, on [[Christmas Eve]] the retreat began anew when the First Ukrainian Front (renamed from the Voronezh Front) struck them in the same place. The Soviet advance continued along the railway line until the 1939 Polish\u2013Soviet border was reached on 3 January 1944.\n\nTo the south, the Second Ukrainian Front (ex [[Steppe Front]]) had crossed the Dnieper at [[Kremenchug]] and continued westwards. In the second week of January 1944 they swung north, meeting Vatutin's tank forces which had swung south from their penetration into Poland and surrounding ten German divisions at Korsun\u2013Shevchenkovsky, west of [[Korsun\u2013Shevchenkovsky Offensive|Cherkassy]]. Hitler's insistence on holding the Dnieper line, even when facing the prospect of catastrophic defeat, was compounded by his conviction that the Cherkassy pocket could break out and even advance to Kiev, but Manstein was more concerned about being able to advance to the edge of the pocket and then implore the surrounded forces to break out.\n\nBy 16 February the first stage was complete, with panzers separated from the contracting Cherkassy pocket only by the swollen Gniloy Tikich river. Under shellfire and pursued by Soviet tanks, the surrounded German troops, among whom were the [[SS Division (motorised) Wiking|5th SS Panzer Division ''Wiking'']], fought their way across the river to safety, although at the cost of half their number and all their equipment. They assumed the Red Army would not attack again, with the spring approaching, but on 3 March the Soviet Ukrainian Front went over to the offensive. Having already isolated the Crimea by severing the [[Isthmus of Perekop|Perekop isthmus]], Malinovsky's forces advanced across the mud to the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] border, not stopping on the river [[Prut]].\n\n[[File:Eastern Front 1943-08 to 1944-12.png|thumb|Soviet advances from 1 August 1943 to 31 December 1944: {{legend|#fff8d5|to 1 December 1943}} {{legend|#ffd2b9|to 30 April 1944}} {{legend|#ebd7ff|to 19 August 1944}} {{legend|#ccffcd|to 31 December 1944}}]]\nOne final move in the south completed the 1943\u201344 campaigning season, which had wrapped up a Soviet advance of over 500 miles. In March, 20 German divisions of ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Hans-Valentin Hube]]'s [[1st Panzer Army]] were encircled in what was to be known as [[Kamenets-Podolsky pocket|Hube's Pocket]] near Kamenets-Podolskiy. After two weeks' of heavy fighting, the 1st Panzer managed to escape the pocket, at the cost of losing almost the entire heavy equipment. At this point, Hitler sacked several prominent generals, Manstein included. In April, the Red Army took back [[Odessa]], followed by 4th Ukrainian Front's campaign to restore control over the Crimea, which culminated in the capture of [[Sevastopol]] on 10 May.\n\nAlong Army Group Centre's front, August 1943 saw this force pushed back from the Hagen line slowly, ceding comparatively little territory, but the loss of Bryansk, and more importantly Smolensk, on 25 September cost the ''Wehrmacht'' the keystone of the entire German defensive system. The 4th and 9th armies and 3rd Panzer Army still held their own east of the upper Dnieper, stifling Soviet attempts to reach Vitebsk. On Army Group North's front, there was barely any fighting at all until January 1944, when out of nowhere Volkhov and Second Baltic Fronts struck.<ref name=\"glantz\"/>\n\nIn a lightning campaign, the Germans were pushed back from Leningrad and [[Novgorod]] was captured by Soviet forces. After a 75-mile advance in January and February, the Leningrad Front had reached the borders of Estonia.

Accordingly, they stripped troops from Army Group Centre, whose front still protruded deep into the Soviet Union. The Germans had transferred some units to France to counter the [[invasion of Normandy]] two weeks before. The Belorussian Offensive (codenamed [[Operation Bagration]]), which was agreed upon by Allies at the [[Tehran Conference]] in December 1943 and launched on 22 June 1944, was a massive Soviet attack, consisting of four Soviet army groups totalling over 120 divisions that smashed into a thinly held German line.\n\nThey focused their massive attacks on Army Group Centre, not Army Group North Ukraine as the Germans had originally expected. More than 2.3 million Soviet troops went into action against German Army Group Centre, which had a strength of fewer than 800,000 men. At the points of attack, the numerical and quality advantages of the Soviet forces were overwhelming. The Red Army achieved a ratio of ten to one in tanks and seven to one in aircraft over their enemy. The Germans crumbled. The capital of [[Belarus]], [[Minsk]], was taken on 3 July, trapping some 100,000 Germans. Ten days later the Red Army reached the prewar Polish border. ''Bagration'' was, by any measure, one of the largest single operations of the war.\n\nBy the end of August 1944, it had cost the Germans ~400,000 dead, wounded, missing and sick, from whom 160,000 were captured, as well as 2,000 tanks and 57,000 other vehicles.

Stalin and Hitler both disregarded human life in order to achieve their goal of victory. This included the terrorisation of their own people, as well as [[mass deportation]]s of entire populations.

Behind the front lines, [[wikt:atrocity|atrocities]] against civilians in German-occupied areas were routine, including those carried out as part of the Holocaust. German and German-allied forces treated civilian populations with exceptional brutality, massacring whole village populations and routinely killing civilian hostages (see [[German war crimes]]). Both sides practised widespread [[scorched earth]] tactics, but the loss of civilian lives in the case of Germany was incomparably smaller than that of the Soviet Union, in which at least 20 million were killed. According to British historian [[Geoffrey Hosking]], \"The full demographic loss to the Soviet peoples was even greater: since a high proportion of those killed were young men of child-begetting age, the postwar Soviet population was 45 to 50 million smaller than post-1939 projections would have led one to expect.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Hosking|first=Geoffrey A.|title=Rulers and Victims: The Russians in the Soviet Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDMVMqDvp4QC&pg=PA242|year=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02178-5|page=242}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Red Army invaded Germany in 1944, many German civilians suffered from reprisals by Red Army soldiers (see [[Soviet war crimes]]). After the war, following the [[Yalta conference]] agreements between the Allies, the [[German people|German populations]] of [[East Prussia]] and [[Silesia]] were [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u20131950)|displaced to the west]] of the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]], in what became one of the largest [[forced migration]]s of people in world history.\n\nThe Soviet Union came out of World War II militarily victorious but economically and structurally devastated. Much of the combat took place in or close to populated areas, and the actions of both sides contributed to massive loss of civilian life and tremendous material damage. According to a summary, presented by Lieutenant General [[Roman Rudenko]] at the [[Nuremberg Trials|International Military Tribunal]] in [[Nuremberg]], the property damage in the Soviet Union inflicted by the Axis invasion was estimated to a value of 679 billion rubles. The largest number of civilian deaths in a single city was 1.2 million citizens dead during the [[Siege of Leningrad]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 February 1946, Volume 95, Number 32158.</ref>\n\nThe combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710 cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850 industrial establishments, 40,000 miles of railroad, 4,100 railroad stations, 40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000 public libraries; leaving 25 million homeless. Seven million horses, 17 million cattle, 20 million pigs, 27 million sheep were also slaughtered or driven off.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Wild fauna were also affected. Wolves and foxes fleeing westward from the killing zone, as the Soviet army advanced between 1943 and 1945, were responsible for a [[rabies]] epidemic that spread slowly westwards, reaching the coast of the [[English Channel]] by 1968.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|2007|pp=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\n==Leadership==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}\nThe Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were both ideologically driven states (by [[Soviet communism]] and by [[Nazism]] respectively), in which the foremost political [[leader]]s had [[Totalitarianism|near-absolute power]]. The character of the war was thus determined by the political leaders and their [[ideology]] to a much greater extent than in any other theatre of World War II.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Adolf Hitler===\n{{Main|Adolf Hitler}}\n[[File:Adolf Hitler cropped restored.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Adolf Hitler]] led Germany during World War II.]]\n\nAdolf Hitler exercised tight control over the German war-effort, spending much of his time in his command bunkers (most notably at [[Rastenburg]] in [[East Prussia]], at [[Vinnitsa]] in [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]], and under the garden of the [[Reich Chancellery]] in [[Berlin]]). At crucial periods in the war he held daily situation-conferences at which he used his remarkable talent for public speaking to overwhelm opposition from his generals and from the OKW staff with rhetoric.\n\nIn part because of the unexpected degree of German success in the Battle of France (despite the warnings of the professional military) Hitler believed himself a military genius, with a grasp of the total war-effort that eluded his generals. In August 1941, when [[Walther von Brauchitsch]] (commander-in-chief of the ''Wehrmacht'') and [[Fedor von Bock]] appealed for an attack on Moscow, Hitler instead ordered the encirclement and capture of Ukraine, in order to acquire the farmland, industry, and natural resources of that country. Some historians like Bevin Alexander in ''How Hitler Could Have Won'' regard this decision as a missed opportunity to win the war.\n\nIn the winter of 1941\u20131942 Hitler believed that his obstinate refusal to allow the German armies to retreat had saved Army Group Centre from collapse. He later told [[Erhard Milch]]:\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B24543, Hauptquartier Heeresgruppe S\u00fcd, Lagebesprechung.jpg|thumb|Hitler with generals [[Friedrich Paulus]], [[Adolf Heusinger]] and [[Fedor von Bock]] in Poltawa, German-occupied Ukraine, June 1942]]\n\n<blockquote>\nI had to act ruthlessly. I had to send even my closest generals packing, two army generals, for example \u2026 I could only tell these gentlemen, \"Get yourself back to Germany as rapidly as you can \u2013 but leave the army in my charge. And the army is staying at the front.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nThe success of this [[hedgehog defence]] outside Moscow led Hitler to insist on the holding of territory when it made no military sense, and to sack generals who retreated without orders. Officers with initiative were replaced with yes-men or with fanatical Nazis. The disastrous encirclements later in the war \u2013 at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], [[Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket|Korsun]] and many other places \u2013 resulted directly from Hitler's orders. This idea of holding territory led to another failed plan, dubbed{{by whom|date=May 2018}} \"''Heaven-bound Missions''\", which involved fortifying even the most unimportant or insignificant of cities and the holding of these \"fortresses\" at all costs. Many divisions became cut off in \"fortress\" cities, or wasted uselessly in secondary theatres, because Hitler would not sanction retreat or voluntarily abandon any of his conquests.\n\nFrustration at Hitler's [[leadership]] in the war was one of the factors in the attempted [[coup d'etat]] of 1944, but after the failure of the [[20 July Plot]] Hitler considered the army and its officer corps suspect and came to rely on the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) and Nazi party members to prosecute the war.\n\nHitler's direction of the war ultimately proved disastrous for the German Army, though the skill, loyalty, professionalism and endurance of officers and soldiers enabled him to keep Germany fighting to the end. [[F. W. Winterbotham]] wrote of Hitler's signal to [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] to continue the attack to the west during the [[Battle of the Bulge]]:\n\n{{quote|From experience we had learned that when Hitler started refusing to do what the generals recommended, things started to go wrong, and this was to be no exception.}}\n\n===Joseph Stalin===\n{{Main|Joseph Stalin}}\n[[File:CroppedStalin1943.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Stalin]] led the Soviet Union during World War II.]]\n\nJoseph Stalin bore the greatest responsibility for some of the disasters at the beginning of the war (for example, the [[Battle of Kiev (1941)]]), but equally deserves praise for the subsequent success of the Soviet [[Red Army]], which depended on the unprecedentedly [[History of the Soviet Union (1927\u20131953)|rapid industrialisation of the Soviet Union]], which Stalin's internal policy had made the first priority throughout the 1930s.\nStalin's [[Great Purge]] of the Red Army in the late 1930s involved the legal prosecution of many of the senior command, many of whom the courts convicted and sentenced to death or to imprisonment.\n\nThe executed included [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], a proponent of armoured [[blitzkrieg]]. Stalin promoted some [[obscurantist]]s like [[Grigory Kulik]] who opposed the mechanisation of the army and the production of tanks, but on the other hand purged the older commanders who had held their positions since the [[Russian Civil War]] of 1917\u20131922, and who had experience, but were deemed \"politically unreliable\". This opened up their places to the promotion of many younger officers that Stalin and the [[NKVD]] regarded as in line with [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] politics. Many{{quantify|date=May 2018}} of these newly promoted commanders proved terribly inexperienced, but some later became very successful. Soviet tank-output remained the largest in the world.\n\nFrom the foundation of the Red Army in 1918, political distrust of the military had led to a system of \"dual command\", with every commander paired with a [[political commissar]], a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. Larger units had military councils consisting of the commander, commissar and chief of staff \u2013 commissars ensured the loyalty of the commanding officers and implemented Party orders.\n\nFollowing the [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|Soviet occupation of eastern Poland]], of the [[Occupation and annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union (1940)|Baltic states]] and of [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]] in 1939\u20131940, Stalin insisted on the occupation of every fold of the newly Sovietized territories; this move westward positioned troops far from their depots, in salients that left them vulnerable to encirclement. As tension heightened in spring, 1941, Stalin desperately tried not to give Hitler any provocation that Berlin could use as an excuse for a German attack; Stalin refused to allow the military to go on the alert \u2013 even as German troops gathered on the borders and German reconnaissance planes overflew installations. This refusal to take necessary action was instrumental in the destruction of major portions of the Red Air Force, lined up on its airfields, in the first days of the German-Soviet war.\n\nAt the crisis of the war, in the autumn of 1942, Stalin made many concessions to the army: the government restored unitary command by removing the Commissars from the [[chain of command]]. Order 25 of 15 January 1943 introduced [[Shoulder mark|shoulderboards]] for all ranks; this represented a significant symbolic step, since after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] shoulderboards had connotations as a symbol of the old Tsarist r\u00e9gime. Beginning in autumn 1941, units that had proved themselves by superior performance in combat were given the traditional \"Guards\" title.{{Sfn | Glantz | 2005 | p = 181}}\n\nThese concessions were combined with ruthless discipline: [[Order No. 227]], issued on 28 July 1942, threatened commanders who retreated without orders with punishment by [[court-martial]].

For the majority of people of the Soviet Union, the Nazi invasion was viewed as a brutal act of unprovoked aggression. While it is important to note that not all parts of Soviet society viewed the German advance in this way, the majority of the Soviet population viewed German forces as occupiers. In areas such as [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]] (which had been annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940) the ''Wehrmacht'' was tolerated by a relatively more significant part of the native population.\n\nThis was particularly true for the territories of Western Ukraine, recently rejoined to the Soviet Union, where the anti-Polish and anti-Soviet [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|Ukrainian nationalist underground]] hoped in vain to establish the \"independent state\", relying on German armed force. However, Soviet society as a whole was hostile to the invading Nazis from the very start. The nascent national liberation movements among Ukrainians and [[Cossack]]s, and others were viewed by Hitler with suspicion; some, especially those from the Baltic States, were co-opted into the Axis armies and others brutally suppressed. None of the conquered territories gained any measure of self-rule.\n\nInstead, the [[Nazism|Nazi ideologues]] saw the future of the East as one of settlement by German colonists, with the natives killed, expelled, or reduced to slave labour. The cruel and brutally inhumane treatment of Soviet civilians, women, children and elderly, the daily bombings of civilian cities and towns, Nazi pillaging of Soviet villages and hamlets and unprecedented harsh punishment and treatment of civilians in general were some of the primary reasons for Soviet resistance to Nazi Germany's invasion. Indeed, the Soviets viewed Germany's invasion as an act of aggression and an attempt to conquer and enslave the local population.\n\n[[File:Einsatzgruppen murder Jews in Ivanhorod, Ukraine, 1942.jpg|link=Ivanhorod Einsatzgruppen photograph, 1942|thumb|[[Ivanhorod Einsatzgruppen photograph|Einsatzgruppen murdering Jews]] in [[Ivanhorod]], Ukraine, 1942]]\nRegions closer to the front were managed by military powers of the region, in other areas such as the Baltic states annexed by the USSR in 1940, Reichscommissariats were established. As a rule, the maximum in loot was extracted. In September 1941, [[Erich Koch]] was appointed to the Ukrainian Commissariat. His opening speech was clear about German policy: \"I am known as a brutal dog ... Our job is to suck from Ukraine all the goods we can get hold of ... I am expecting from you the utmost severity towards the native population.\"\n\nAtrocities against the Jewish population in the conquered areas began almost immediately, with the dispatch of ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' (task groups) to round up Jews and shoot them.<ref>[http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/barbarossa/ Marking 70 Years to Operation Barbarossa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916093736/http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/barbarossa/ |date=16 September 2012 }} on the [[Yad Vashem]] website</ref>\n\nThe massacres of Jews and other [[Ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]] were only a part of the deaths from the Nazi occupation. Many hundreds of thousands of Soviet civilians were executed, and millions more died from [[starvation]] as the Germans requisitioned food for their armies and fodder for their draft horses. As they retreated from Ukraine and Belarus in 1943\u201344, the German occupiers systematically applied a [[scorched earth]] policy, burning towns and cities, destroying infrastructure, and leaving civilians to starve or die of exposure.<ref>On 7 September 1943, [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] sent orders to [[HSSPF]] \"Ukraine\" [[Hans-Adolf Pr\u00fctzmann]] that \"not a human being, not a single head of cattle, not a hundredweight of cereals and not a railway line remain behind; that not a house remains standing, not a mine is available which is not destroyed for years to come, that there is not a well which is not poisoned. The enemy must really find completely burned and destroyed land\". He ordered cooperation with Infantry general Staff, also someone named Stampf, and sent copies to the Chief of Regular Police, Chief of Security Police & SS, [[SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]] Berger, and the chief of the partisan combating units. See ''Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression, Supplement A'' pg 1270.</ref> In many towns, the battles were fought within towns and cities with trapped civilians caught in the middle.

Stalin's [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plans]] of the 1930s had resulted in the industrialisation of the Urals and central Asia. In 1941, thousands of trains evacuated critical factories and workers from Belarus and Ukraine to safe areas far from the front lines. Once these facilities were reassembled east of the Urals, production could be resumed without fear of German bombing.\n\nAs the Soviet Union's manpower reserves ran low from 1943 onwards, the great Soviet offensives had to depend more on equipment and less on the expenditure of lives.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} The increases in production of [[materiel]] were achieved at the expense of civilian living standards \u2013 the most thorough application of the principle of [[total war]] \u2013 and with the help of [[Lend-Lease]] supplies from the United Kingdom and the United States. The Germans, on the other hand, could rely on a large slave workforce from the conquered countries and Soviet POWs. American exports and technical expertise also enabled the Soviets to produce goods that they wouldn't have been able to on their own. For example, while the USSR was able to produce fuel of octane numbers from 70 to 74, Soviet industry only met 4% of demand for fuel of octane numbers from 90+; all aircraft produced after 1939 required fuel of the latter category. To fulfill demands, the USSR depended on American assistance, both in finished products and TEL.<ref>Alexander Matveichuk.

Consumption on all fronts during the same period was 1.493 million tons of explosives and 626,887 tons of powder.<ref>US Strategic Bombing Survey \"Appendix D. Strategic Air Attack on the Powder and Explosives Industries\", Table D7: German Monthly Production of Powders and Exploders (Including Extenders) and Consumption by German Armed Forces</ref> From 1941\u20131945, the USSR produced only 505,000 tons of explosives and received 105,000 tons of Lend-Lease imports.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Germany outproduced the Soviet Union 3.16 to 1 in explosives tonnage.\n\nSoviet armoured fighting vehicle production was greater than the Germans (in 1943, the [[Soviet armored fighting vehicle production during World War II|Soviet Union manufactured 24,089 tanks and self-propelled guns]] to [[German armored fighting vehicle production during World War II|Germany's 19,800]]). The Soviets incrementally upgraded existing designs, and simplified and refined manufacturing processes to increase production, and were helped by a mass infusion of harder to produce goods such as aviation fuel, machine tools, trucks, and high-explosives from Lend-Lease, allowing them to concentrate on a few key industries. Meanwhile, Germany had been cut off from foreign trade for years by the time it invaded the USSR, was in the middle of two extended and costly theatres at air and sea that further limited production ([[Battle of the Atlantic]] and [[Defence of the Reich]]), and was forced to devote a large segment of its expenditures to goods the Soviets could cut back on (such as trucks) or which would never even be used against the Soviets (such as ships). Naval vessels alone constituted 10\u201315% of Germany's war expenditures from 1940 to 1944 depending on the year, while armoured vehicles by comparison were only 5\u20138%.<ref>Military Analysis Division, U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey- European War, Volume 3, page 144.

The multiple battles and the use of [[scorched earth]] tactics destroyed [[Agriculture|agricultural land]], infrastructure, and whole towns, leaving much of the population homeless and without food.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Military losses on the Eastern Front during World War II<ref>R\u00fcdiger Overmans, ''Deutsche milit\u00e4rische Verluste im Zweiten Weltkrieg''.
