However, evidence discovered in the mid-20th century shows it one of Aeschylus' last plays, definitely after ''[[The Persians]]'' and possibly after ''[[Seven Against Thebes]]''{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.<blockquote>\"Those at least who judge by the style, the simplicity of the plot, the paucity of the characters, and the predominance of choric action, will be reluctant to believe that the ''Suppliants'' was composed more than ten years after the ''Prometheus'', ''Persians'', and ''Seven against Thebes''. It may be remarked, though not as an evidence of date, that the play is rather a melodrama than a tragedy. It ends happily, and has no other claim to the latter title than from the pathos excited and sustained by the helpless condition of the fugitive maidens in a foreign land. On the whole, it is rather a good play; and though it has obtained a bad name among scholars on the score of its many corruptions, yet there is a grace and a dignity in the choruses, and a general tenderness, virtue, and artlessness in the characters, that impart a very pleasing tone to the whole composition.\"<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n== Plot of ''The Suppliants'' ==\n\nThe [[Dana\u00efdes|Danaids]] form the chorus and serve as the protagonists.  They flee a forced marriage to their [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] cousins.  When the Danaids reach [[Argos]], they entreat King [[Pelasgus]] to protect them.  He refuses pending the decision of the Argive people, who decide in the favour of the Danaids.  [[Danaus]] rejoices the outcome, and the Danaids praise the Greek gods.  Almost immediately, a herald of the Egyptians comes to attempt to force the Danaids to return to their cousins for marriage.  Pelasgus arrives, threatens the herald, and urges the Danaids to remain within the walls of Argos.  The play ends with the Danaids retreating into the Argive walls, protected.\n\n== Lost plays of the tetralogy ==\nThe remaining plays of the tetralogy have been mostly lost.  However, one significant passage from ''The Danaids'' has been preserved.  This is a speech by the goddess of love [[Aphrodite]] praising the marriage between the sky (the groom) and the earth (the bride) from which rain comes, nourishing cattle, corn and fruits.<ref name=thomson/>\n\nAs the plot of the remaining plays has been generally reconstructed, following a war with the Aegyptids in which Pelasgus has been killed, Danaus becomes tyrant of Argos. The marriage is forced upon his daughters, but Danaus instructs them to murder their husbands on their wedding night. All do except for [[Hypermnestra]], whose husband, Lynceus, flees. Danaus imprisons or threatens to kill Hypermnestra for her disobedience, but Lynceus reappears and kills Danaus; Lynceus becomes the new king of Argos, with Hypermnestra as his queen. Opinions differ as to the ending, although certainly [[Aphrodite]] was involved in the denouement.

However, evidence discovered in the mid-20th century shows it one of Aeschylus' last plays, definitely after ''[[The Persians]]'' and possibly after ''[[Seven Against Thebes]]''{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.<blockquote>\"Those at least who judge by the style, the simplicity of the plot, the paucity of the characters, and the predominance of choric action, will be reluctant to believe that the ''Suppliants'' was composed more than ten years after the ''Prometheus'', ''Persians'', and ''Seven against Thebes''. It may be remarked, though not as an evidence of date, that the play is rather a melodrama than a tragedy. It ends happily, and has no other claim to the latter title than from the pathos excited and sustained by the helpless condition of the fugitive maidens in a foreign land. On the whole, it is rather a good play; and though it has obtained a bad name among scholars on the score of its many corruptions, yet there is a grace and a dignity in the choruses, and a general tenderness, virtue, and artlessness in the characters, that impart a very pleasing tone to the whole composition.\"<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n== Plot of ''The Suppliants'' ==\n\nThe [[Dana\u00efdes|Danaids]] form the chorus and serve as the protagonists.  They flee a forced marriage to their [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] cousins.  When the Danaids reach [[Argos]], they entreat King [[Pelasgus]] to protect them.  He refuses pending the decision of the Argive people, who decide in the favour of the Danaids.  [[Danaus]] rejoices the outcome, and the Danaids praise the Greek gods.  Almost immediately, a herald of the Egyptians comes to attempt to force the Danaids to return to their cousins for marriage.  Pelasgus arrives, threatens the herald, and urges the Danaids to remain within the walls of Argos.  The play ends with the Danaids retreating into the Argive walls, protected.\n\n== Lost plays of the tetralogy ==\nThe remaining plays of the tetralogy have been mostly lost.  However, one significant passage from ''The Danaids'' has been preserved.  This is a speech by the goddess of love [[Aphrodite]] praising the marriage between the sky (the groom) and the earth (the bride) from which rain comes, nourishing cattle, corn and fruits.<ref name=thomson/>\n\nAs the plot of the remaining plays has been generally reconstructed, following a war with the Aegyptids in which Pelasgus has been killed, Danaus becomes tyrant of Argos. The marriage is forced upon his daughters, but Danaus instructs them to murder their husbands on their wedding night. All do except for [[Hypermnestra]], whose husband, Lynceus, flees. Danaus imprisons or threatens to kill Hypermnestra for her disobedience, but Lynceus reappears and kills Danaus; Lynceus becomes the new king of Argos, with Hypermnestra as his queen. Opinions differ as to the ending, although certainly [[Aphrodite]] was involved in the denouement.  One opinion is that Lynceus now must decide how to punish the forty-nine homicidal Danaids, when [[Aphrodite]] appears in ''[[deus ex machina]]'' fashion and absolves them of the murders, as they were obeying their father; she then persuades them to abandon their celibate ways, and the trilogy closes with their marriages to forty-nine local Argive men. An alternative opinion is that Hypermnestra is put on trial for disobeying her father and Aphrodite successfully defends her similarly to [[Apollo]]'s defence of [[Orestes]] in ''[[Oresteia]]''.  The trilogy was followed by the [[satyr play]] ''Amymone'', which comically portrayed one of the Danaids' seduction by Poseidon.<ref name=trilogy/>\n\n==Themes==\n\"The political as well as the theological views of the poet are well set forth in the ''Suppliants''.

He then went in business with the French construction firm Oger for the construction of a hotel in [[Ta\u2019if]], [[Saudi Arabia]], the timely construction of which earned praise from [[King Khaled]]. Hariri took over Oger, forming [[Saudi Oger]], which became the main construction firm used by the [[Saudi Royal family]] for all their important developments. As a result, a few years after his first contract with King Khaled, Hariri had become a multi-billionaire.\n\n{{Politics of Lebanon}}\nHaving accumulated his wealth, Hariri started a number of philanthropic projects, including the building of educational facilities in Lebanon. His first initiative in Lebanon was the Islamic Association for Culture and Education, which he founded in 1979.<ref name=mermay>{{cite journal|title=Lebanon's Politics: The Sunni Community and Hariri's Future Current|journal=[[Middle East Report]]|date=26 May 2010|issue=96|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/Middle%20East%20North%20Africa/Iraq%20Syria%20Lebanon/Lebanon/96%20Lebanons%20Politics%20-%20The%20Sunni%20Community%20and%20Hariris%20Future%20Current.ashx|accessdate=22 September 2013}}</ref> The association was later renamed the Hariri Foundation.<ref name=mermay/> Hariri became progressively more embroiled in politics. His appeals to the United Nations and services as an emissary to the Saudi Royal family won him international recognition on the political stage for his humanitarian efforts.\n\nIn 1982, Hariri donated $12 million to Lebanese victims of the [[1978 South Lebanon conflict]] and helped clean up Beirut's streets with his company's money and contributed to early reconstruction efforts during lulls in the Lebanon war. Said to have heavily financed opposing militias during the war, his former deputy [[Najah Wakim]] later accused him of helping to destroy downtown Beirut in order to rebuild it again and make billions of dollars in the process.<ref name=gary2001july/> After the conflict, he acted as an envoy of the [[House of Saud|Saudi royal family]] to Lebanon. He laid the groundwork that led to the 1989 [[Taif Accord]], which Saudi Arabia organised to bring the warring factions together. Taif put an end to the [[Lebanese civil war|civil war]], building goodwill for Hariri politically. While acting as the Saudi envoy to Lebanon, he spent more time in Damascus than in Beirut where he ingratiated himself with the [[Assad regime]]; he had a new presidential palace built in Damascus as a gift to the Syrian dictator but Assad didn't use it personally.<ref name=gary2001july/>\n\n==Political career==\nHariri returned to Lebanon in the early 1980s as a wealthy man and began to build a name for himself by making large donations and contributions to various groups in Lebanon.

A large component of \"Horizon 2000\" was [[Solidere]], the privately owned<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.solidere.com/solidere.html |title=''About Solidere'' |publisher=Solidere.com |accessdate=4 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116054209/http://www.solidere.com/solidere.html |archivedate=16 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> construction company that was established to reconstruct post-war Lebanon. Solidere was owned by the government and private investors. Solidere was largely focused on redeveloping Beirut's downtown and turning it into a new urban center as quickly as possible as one aspect of the various infrastructure redevelopment plans that would be implemented by \"Horizon 2000\". Another aspect of the decade-long plan was the privatization of major industries. Numerous contracts were awarded in important industries such as energy, telecommunications, electricity, airports and roads.\n\nThe last and perhaps most significant aspect of \"Horizon 2000\" was economic stimulus via foreign direct investment. Specifically, Hariri supported foreign firms and individuals taking an interest in Lebanon's developmental potential. Hariri simplified tax codes and provided tax breaks to foreign investors. Due to his previous successes in the private sector and the numerous resulting international connections, Hariri was able to garner a significant amount of low-interest loans from foreign investors. Hariri also pursued aggressive macroeconomic policy such as maintaining strict regulations on bank reserves and inter-bank interest rates to curb inflation and raise the value of the Lebanese pound relative to the dollar.\n\nHariri's economic policies were a remarkable success during his first year in office. From 1992 to 1993 there was a 6 percent increase in real national income, the capital base of commercial banks effectively doubled, the budgetary earnings hovered at around a billion dollars, and commercial banks\u2019 consolidated balance sheets increased about 25%. By 1998, however, real GDP growth was around 1%, a year later it would be -1%, national debt had skyrocketed 540% from two to eighteen billion dollars, Lebanon's economy was in a miserable state.\n\n=== Hariri and Lebanon's political environment ===\n[[Image:Rafik_Hariri_George_W._Bush.jpg|thumb|left|[[George W.

Hariri is widely credited with his role in constructing the [[Taif Agreement]] that ended the 15 year [[Lebanese Civil War]] and reconstructing the capital [[Beirut]]. He was the first post-civil war Prime Minister and the most influential and wealthiest Lebanese politician until his assassination. \n\n<!-- Assassination -->\nHariri was assassinated on 14 February 2005 by a suicide truck bomb in Beirut. Four Hezbollah members were indicted for the assassination and are currently being tried ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' by the [[Special Tribunal for Lebanon]], but others have linked the assassination to the [[Syria]]n government.\n\n<!-- Consequences -->\n[[Assassination of Rafic Hariri|Hariri's assassination]] was a catalyst for dramatic political change in Lebanon. The massive protests of the [[Cedar Revolution]] helped achieve the withdrawal of Syrian troops and security forces from Lebanon, and a change in governments.\n\n==Early life and education==\nHariri was born on 1 November 1944 to a modest [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni Muslim]] family in the Lebanese port city of [[Sidon]]. He had two siblings (brother Shafic and sister [[Bahia Hariri|Bahia]])<ref name=Foundation/> He attended elementary and secondary school in Sidon,<ref name=Foundation/> and graduated in business administration from [[Beirut Arab University]].<ref name=\"Rafik Hariri NYT\"/>\n\n==Career==\n\nIn 1965, Hariri went to [[Saudi Arabia]] to work.<ref name=\"Rafik Hariri NYT\"/> There, he taught for a short period of time before shifting to the construction industry.<ref name=\"Rafik Hariri, Ex-Premier of Lebanon, Dies at 60\"/> In 1978, he gained [[Saudi Arabian nationality law|Saudi Arabian citizenship]],<ref name=\"Rafik Hariri NYT\"/><ref name=gary2001july>{{cite journal|last=Gambill|first=Gary C.|author2=Ziad K.

He then went in business with the French construction firm Oger for the construction of a hotel in [[Ta\u2019if]], [[Saudi Arabia]], the timely construction of which earned praise from [[King Khaled]]. Hariri took over Oger, forming [[Saudi Oger]], which became the main construction firm used by the [[Saudi Royal family]] for all their important developments. As a result, a few years after his first contract with King Khaled, Hariri had become a multi-billionaire.\n\n{{Politics of Lebanon}}\nHaving accumulated his wealth, Hariri started a number of philanthropic projects, including the building of educational facilities in Lebanon. His first initiative in Lebanon was the Islamic Association for Culture and Education, which he founded in 1979.<ref name=mermay>{{cite journal|title=Lebanon's Politics: The Sunni Community and Hariri's Future Current|journal=[[Middle East Report]]|date=26 May 2010|issue=96|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/Middle%20East%20North%20Africa/Iraq%20Syria%20Lebanon/Lebanon/96%20Lebanons%20Politics%20-%20The%20Sunni%20Community%20and%20Hariris%20Future%20Current.ashx|accessdate=22 September 2013}}</ref> The association was later renamed the Hariri Foundation.<ref name=mermay/> Hariri became progressively more embroiled in politics. His appeals to the United Nations and services as an emissary to the Saudi Royal family won him international recognition on the political stage for his humanitarian efforts.\n\nIn 1982, Hariri donated $12 million to Lebanese victims of the [[1978 South Lebanon conflict]] and helped clean up Beirut's streets with his company's money and contributed to early reconstruction efforts during lulls in the Lebanon war. Said to have heavily financed opposing militias during the war, his former deputy [[Najah Wakim]] later accused him of helping to destroy downtown Beirut in order to rebuild it again and make billions of dollars in the process.<ref name=gary2001july/> After the conflict, he acted as an envoy of the [[House of Saud|Saudi royal family]] to Lebanon. He laid the groundwork that led to the 1989 [[Taif Accord]], which Saudi Arabia organised to bring the warring factions together. Taif put an end to the [[Lebanese civil war|civil war]], building goodwill for Hariri politically. While acting as the Saudi envoy to Lebanon, he spent more time in Damascus than in Beirut where he ingratiated himself with the [[Assad regime]]; he had a new presidential palace built in Damascus as a gift to the Syrian dictator but Assad didn't use it personally.<ref name=gary2001july/>\n\n==Political career==\nHariri returned to Lebanon in the early 1980s as a wealthy man and began to build a name for himself by making large donations and contributions to various groups in Lebanon. However, he continued to serve as a political advisor to [[Prince Bandar bin Sultan]] in 1983.<ref name=saad9july>{{cite news|last=Mehio|first=Saad|title=Prime Minister Alwaleed bin Talal?

Perhaps Hariri's most important creation in the beginning of his career was \"Horizon 2000\" the government's name for its new rejuvenation plan. A large component of \"Horizon 2000\" was [[Solidere]], the privately owned<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.solidere.com/solidere.html |title=''About Solidere'' |publisher=Solidere.com |accessdate=4 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116054209/http://www.solidere.com/solidere.html |archivedate=16 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> construction company that was established to reconstruct post-war Lebanon. Solidere was owned by the government and private investors. Solidere was largely focused on redeveloping Beirut's downtown and turning it into a new urban center as quickly as possible as one aspect of the various infrastructure redevelopment plans that would be implemented by \"Horizon 2000\". Another aspect of the decade-long plan was the privatization of major industries. Numerous contracts were awarded in important industries such as energy, telecommunications, electricity, airports and roads.\n\nThe last and perhaps most significant aspect of \"Horizon 2000\" was economic stimulus via foreign direct investment. Specifically, Hariri supported foreign firms and individuals taking an interest in Lebanon's developmental potential. Hariri simplified tax codes and provided tax breaks to foreign investors. Due to his previous successes in the private sector and the numerous resulting international connections, Hariri was able to garner a significant amount of low-interest loans from foreign investors. Hariri also pursued aggressive macroeconomic policy such as maintaining strict regulations on bank reserves and inter-bank interest rates to curb inflation and raise the value of the Lebanese pound relative to the dollar.\n\nHariri's economic policies were a remarkable success during his first year in office. From 1992 to 1993 there was a 6 percent increase in real national income, the capital base of commercial banks effectively doubled, the budgetary earnings hovered at around a billion dollars, and commercial banks\u2019 consolidated balance sheets increased about 25%. By 1998, however, real GDP growth was around 1%, a year later it would be -1%, national debt had skyrocketed 540% from two to eighteen billion dollars, Lebanon's economy was in a miserable state.\n\n=== Hariri and Lebanon's political environment ===\n[[Image:Rafik_Hariri_George_W._Bush.jpg|thumb|left|[[George W.

He was further accused of making the American coalition in the [[War on Terrorism|war on terrorism]] worthless and asked if he was ready for the consequences of his refusal, reminding him that [[George W. Bush]] had said: \"Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.iran-press-service.com/articles_2001/sep_2001/bush_congress_address_21901.htm|title=\"You Are Either With Us Or With The Terrorists\", President Bush Warns|work=Iran press service|accessdate=4 July 2011}}</ref> He replied that he had hoped there would be no consequences, but would deal with them if they arrive. Hariri further said that he opposed the killing of all humans \u2013 Israeli, Palestinian, Syrian or Lebanese \u2013 and believed in dialogue as a solution. He further went on to say that Syria would have to stay in Lebanon for protection of Lebanon until they are no longer needed and Lebanon asks them to leave.\n\nLebanese [[Druze]] leader [[Walid Jumblatt]], a recent recruit of the anti-Syrian opposition, emboldened by popular anger and civic action now being called Lebanon's [[Cedar Revolution]], alleged in the wake of the assassination that on 26 August 2004 Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]] threatened Hariri, saying \"<nowiki>[</nowiki>President of Lebanon<nowiki>]</nowiki> Lahoud is me. ...

The Company for the Development and Reconstruction of Beirut's Central District, known as [[Solidere]], in which Hariri is the primary shareholder, expropriated most property in the [[Beirut Central District|central business district]] of Beirut, compensating each owner with shares in the company which were worth as little as 15% of the property's value. That Hariri and his business associates profited immensely from this project was an open secret.<ref name=\"Lebanon's vast web of corruption unravels\"/><ref name=\"corruption-nation\">{{cite news|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070305/ciezadlo|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090701151610/http%3A//www%2Ethenation%2Ecom/doc/20070305/ciezadlo |archivedate= 1 July 2009 |title=Sect Symbols|last=Ciezadlo|first=Annia|date=24 February 2007|newspaper=The Nation|accessdate=25 June 2011|location=New York City}}</ref>\n\nHariri and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s were not the only beneficiaries of this spending spree. In order to secure support from militia chieftains, and pro-Syrian ideologues that Damascus had installed in the government, Hariri allowed kickbacks from public spending to enrich all major government figures. Contracts for the import of petroleum were awarded to the two sons of President [[Elias Hrawi]].<ref name=\"Lebanon's vast web of corruption unravels\"/><ref name=\"corruption-nation\"/>\t\n\nAs result of the growing criticism and popular discontent with Hariri's policies, the government banned public demonstrations in 1994 and relied upon the [[Lebanese Army|Army]] to enforce the decree.<ref name=\"Lebanon's vast web of corruption unravels\"/><ref name=\"corruption-nation\"/> In return for a relatively free hand in economic matters, Hariri cooperated with Syria's drive to consolidate its control over Lebanon. Under the guise of \"regulating\" the audiovisual media, the government placed control of all major television and radio stations in the hands of pro-Syrian elites. Supporters of [[Michel Aoun]] were also perpetually harassed and detained.<ref name=\"Lebanon's vast web of corruption unravels\"/><ref name=\"corruption-nation\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nHariri married twice. He had seven children. In 1965, he married an Iraqi woman, Nidal Bustani, who is the mother of his three sons; [[Bahaa Hariri|Bahaa]] (born 1967), who is a businessman, [[Saad Hariri|Saad]], who succeeded his father as leader of the future movement, and Houssam\u2014who died in a traffic accident in the US in the late 1980s.<ref name=medpol/><ref>{{cite news|last= Fisk|first= Robert| authorlink =Robert Fisk|title= Syria mourns death of a 'golden son'|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/syria-mourns-death-of-a-golden-son-basil-assads-fatal-car-crash-throws-open-the-question-of-who-will-succeed-the-president-writes-robert-fisk-in-beirut-1408555.html|archiveurl= https://archive.today/20130826221018/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/syria-mourns-death-of-a-golden-son-basil-assads-fatal-car-crash-throws-open-the-question-of-who-will-succeed-the-president-writes-robert-fisk-in-beirut-1408555.html|archivedate=26 August 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=22 January 1994|location=London}}</ref> They divorced.
