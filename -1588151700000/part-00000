His work played a key role in the development of [[theoretical ecology]] through the 1970s and 1980s. He also applied these tools to the study of disease and to the study of [[biodiversity]].\n\nMay was Gordon MacKay Lecturer in Applied Mathematics at [[Harvard University]] (1959\u201361) and returned to the [[University of Sydney]] (1962) as senior lecturer, reader, and professor (1969\u201372) in [[theoretical physics]]. From 1973 until 1988, he was Class of 1977 Professor of Zoology at [[Princeton University]], serving as chairman of the University Research Board 1977{{Ndash}}88. From 1988 until 1995, he held a [[Royal Society]] Research Professorship jointly at [[Imperial College London]] and the [[University of Oxford]], where became a Fellow of [[Merton College, Oxford]] and a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|Master of Arts]].{{when|date=May 2017}} He was [[Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK Government|Chief Scientific Adviser to HM Government]] and head of the [[Office of Science and Technology]] (1995\u20132000), and president of the [[Royal Society]] (2000\u20132005).\n\n===Public life===\nMay held subsidiary appointments as executive trustee of the [[Nuffield Foundation]], member of the board of the [[United Kingdom Sports Institute]], foundation trustee of the [[Gates Scholarship|Gates Trust]] ([[University of Cambridge]]), chairman of the board of trustees of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], trustee of the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], independent member of the [[Joint Nature Conservation Committee]], trustee of [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund-UK]], president of the [[British Ecological Society]], and member of the [[Committee on Climate Change]].\n\nIn 1996, May asked [[Ig Nobel]] to stop awarding prizes to British scientists because this might lead the public to treat worthwhile research less seriously (see [[Ig Nobel#Reception|Criticism of Ig Nobel]]).\n\n===Climate change co-operation===\nAlthough an [[atheism|atheist]] since age 11, May stated that religion may help society deal with climate change. While referring to what he believes to be a rigid structure of fundamentalist religion, he stated that the co-operational aspects of non-fundamentalist religion may in fact help with climate change. When asked if religious leaders should be doing more to persuade people to combat climate change, he stated that it was absolutely necessary.<ref>Richard Alleyne, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/richard-alleyne/6146656/Maybe-religion-is-the-answer-claims-atheist-scientist.html \"Maybe religion is the answer\" claims-atheist-scientist], The Daily Telegraph, 7 September 2009]</ref>\n\n===Awards and honours===\nMay was appointed [[Knight Bachelor]] in 1996,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=54255 |date=30 December 1995 |page=2 |supp=y}}</ref> and a [[Companion of the Order of Australia]] in 1998.

[[Thornton Wilder]] adapted Nestroy's play into his 1938 farcical play ''The Merchant of Yonkers''.

Dolly makes a living through what she calls \"meddling\" \u2013 matchmaking and numerous sidelines, including dance instruction and [[mandolin]] lessons (\"I Put My Hand In\").  She is currently seeking a wife for grumpy Horace Vandergelder, the well-known half-a-millionaire, but it becomes clear that Dolly intends to marry Horace herself.  Ambrose Kemper, a young artist, wants to marry Horace's weepy niece Ermengarde, but Horace opposes this because Ambrose's vocation does not guarantee a steady living.  Ambrose enlists Dolly's help, and they travel to [[Yonkers, New York]] to visit Horace, who is a prominent citizen there and owns Vandergelder's Hay and Feed.\n\nHorace explains to his two clerks, Cornelius Hackl and Barnaby Tucker, that he is going to get married because \"It Takes a Woman\" to cheerfully do all the household chores.  He plans to travel with Dolly to New York City to march in the Fourteenth Street Association Parade and propose to the widow Irene Molloy, who owns a hat shop there.  Dolly arrives in Yonkers and \"accidentally\" mentions that Irene's first husband might not have died of natural causes, and also mentions that she knows an heiress, Ernestina Money, who may be interested in Horace.  Horace leaves for New York and leaves Cornelius and Barnaby to run the store.\n\nCornelius decides that he and Barnaby need to get out of Yonkers.  They'll go to New York, have a good meal, spend all their money, see the stuffed whale in Barnum's museum, almost get arrested, and each kiss a girl!  They blow up some tomato cans to create a terrible stench and a pretext to close the store.  Dolly mentions that she knows two ladies in New York they should call on: Irene Molloy and her shop assistant, Minnie Fay.  She tells Ermengarde and Ambrose that she'll enter them in the [[polka]] competition at the upscale Harmonia Gardens Restaurant in New York City so Ambrose can demonstrate his ability to be a breadwinner to Horace.  Cornelius, Barnaby, Ambrose, Ermengarde and Dolly take the train to New York (\"Put on Your Sunday Clothes\").\n\nIrene and Minnie open their hat shop for the afternoon.  Irene wants a husband, but does not love Horace Vandergelder.  She declares that she will wear an elaborate hat to impress a gentleman (\"Ribbons Down My Back\").  Cornelius and Barnaby arrive at the shop and pretend to be rich.  Horace and Dolly arrive at the shop, and Cornelius and Barnaby hide from him.  Irene inadvertently mentions that she knows Cornelius Hackl, and Dolly tells her and Horace that even though Cornelius is Horace's clerk by day, he's a New York playboy by night; he's one of ''the'' Hackls.  Minnie screams when she finds Cornelius hiding in the armoire.  Horace is about to open the armoire himself, but Dolly, Irene and Minnie distract him with patriotic sentiments related to subjects like Betsy Ross and The Battle of the Alamo shown in the famous lyrics \"Alamo, remember the Alamo!\" (\"Motherhood March\"). Cornelius sneezes, and Horace storms out, realizing there are men hiding in the shop, but not knowing they are his clerks.\n\nDolly arranges for Cornelius and Barnaby, who are still pretending to be rich, to take the ladies out to dinner to the Harmonia Gardens restaurant to make up for their humiliation.  She teaches Cornelius and Barnaby how to dance since they always have dancing at such establishments (\"Dancing\").  Soon, Cornelius, Irene, Barnaby, and Minnie are happily dancing.  They go to watch the great 14th Street Association Parade together.  Alone, Dolly decides to put her dear departed husband Ephram behind her and to move on with life \"Before the Parade Passes By\".  She asks Ephram's permission to marry Horace, requesting a sign from him.  Dolly catches up with the annoyed Vandergelder, who has missed the whole parade, and she convinces him to give her matchmaking one more chance.  She tells him that Ernestina Money would be perfect for him and asks him to meet her at the swanky Harmonia Gardens that evening.\n\n===Act II===\n[[File:Carol Channing Hello Dolly 1966.jpg|thumb|right|Milo Boulton and [[Carol Channing]] in one of several national tours, 1966 ]]\nCornelius is determined to get a kiss before the night is over, but Barnaby isn't so sure.  As the clerks have no money for a carriage, they tell the girls that walking to the restaurant shows that they've got \"Elegance\".  At the Harmonia Gardens Restaurant, Rudolph, the head waiter, prepares his service crew for Dolly Gallagher Levi's return: their usual lightning service, he tells them, must be \"twice as lightning\" (\"The Waiters' Gallop\").  Horace arrives with his date, but she proves neither as rich nor as elegant as Dolly had implied; furthermore she is soon bored by Horace and leaves, as Dolly had planned she would.\n\nCornelius, Barnaby, and their dates arrive, unaware that Horace is also dining at the restaurant.  Irene and Minnie, inspired by the restaurant's opulence, order the menu's most expensive items. Cornelius and Barnaby grow increasingly anxious as they discover they have little more than a dollar left. Dolly makes her triumphant return to the Harmonia Gardens and is greeted in style by the staff (\"Hello, Dolly!\") She sits in the now-empty seat at Horace's table and proceeds to eat a large, expensive dinner, telling the exasperated Horace that no matter what he says, she will not marry him. Barnaby and Horace hail waiters at the same time, and in the ensuing confusion each drops his wallet and inadvertently picks up the other's. Barnaby is delighted that he can now pay the restaurant bill, while Horace finds only a little spare change.  Barnaby and Cornelius realize that the wallet must belong to Horace. Cornelius, Irene, Barnaby and Minnie try to sneak out during \"The [[Polka]] Contest\", but Horace recognizes them and spots Ermengarde and Ambrose as well. The ensuing free-for-all culminates in a trip to night court.\n\nCornelius and Barnaby confess that they have no money and have never been to New York before. Cornelius declares that even if he has to dig ditches the rest of his life, he'll never forget the day because he had met Irene. Cornelius, Barnaby, and Ambrose then each profess their love for their companion (\"It Only Takes A Moment\"). Dolly convinces the judge that their only crime was being in love. The judge finds everyone innocent and cleared of all charges, but Horace is declared guilty and forced to pay damages. Dolly mentions marriage again, and Horace declares that he wouldn't marry her if she were the last woman in the world.  Dolly angrily bids him \"So Long, Dearie\", telling him that while he's bored and lonely, she'll be living the high life.\n\nThe next morning, back at the hay and feed store, Cornelius and Irene, Barnaby and Minnie, and Ambrose and Ermengarde each set out on new life's paths.  A chastened Horace Vandergelder finally admits that he needs Dolly in his life, but Dolly is unsure about the marriage until her late husband sends her a sign.  Vandergelder spontaneously repeats a saying of Ephram's: \"Money is like manure. It's not worth a thing unless it's spread about, encouraging young things to grow.\"  Horace tells Dolly life would be dull without her, and she promises in return that she'll \"never go away again\" (\"Hello, Dolly\" (reprise)).\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dolly Gallagher Levi''': A widow in her middle years who has decided to begin her life again.

In his review of the opening night performance, ''[[The New York Times]]'' theatre critic Howard Taubman wrote\n\n<blockquote>''Hello, Dolly!'' ... has qualities of freshness and imagination that are rare in the run of our machine-made musicals. It transmutes the broadly stylized mood of a mettlesome farce into the gusto and colors of the musical stage. ...  Mr. Herman's songs are brisk and pointed and always tuneful ... a shrewdly mischievous performance by Carol Channing. ...  Making the necessary reservations for the unnecessary vulgar and frenzied touches, one is glad to welcome ''Hello, Dolly!'' for its warmth, color and high spirits.<ref>Taubman, Howard. [http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?html_title=&tols_title=HELLO,%20DOLLY!%20(PLAY)&pdate=19640117&byline=By%20HOWARD%20TAUBMAN&id=1077011430206 \"Hello Dolly!\"]. ''The New York Times'', 1964</ref></blockquote>\n\nJohn Chapman of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' lauded Carol Channing's performance, declaring her \"the most outgoing woman on the musical stage today \u2013 big and warm, all eyes and smiles, in love with everybody in the theatre and possessing a unique voice ranging somewhat upward from a ''basso profundo''.\"  He also wrote, \"I wouldn't say that Jerry Herman's score is memorable.\"<ref name=Suskin>Suskin, Steven. ''Opening Night on Broadway: A Critical Quotebook of the Golden Era of the Musical Theatre'', pp. 297\u2013301. Schirmer Books, New York, 1990. {{ISBN|0-02-872625-1}}</ref> [[New York Post]] critic Richard Watts, Jr., wrote,\n\n<blockquote>The fact that [''Hello, Dolly!''] seems to me short on charm, warmth, and the intangible quality of distinction in no way alters my conviction that it will be an enormous popular success. Herman has composed a score that is always pleasant and agreeably tuneful, although the only number that comes to mind at the moment is the lively title song. His lyrics could be called serviceable.<ref name=Suskin/></blockquote>\n\nIn the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', [[Walter Kerr]] wrote,\n\n<blockquote>''Hello, Dolly!'' is a musical comedy dream, with Carol Channing the girl of it. ... Channing opens wide her big-as-millstone eyes, spreads her white-gloved arms in ecstatic abandon, trots out on a circular runway that surrounds the orchestra, and proceeds to dance rings around the conductor. ... With hair like orange sea foam, a contralto like a horse's neighing, and a confidential swagger, [she is] a musical comedy performer with all the blowzy glamor of the girls on the sheet music of 1916.</blockquote>\n\nKerr perceived deficiencies in the libretto, though, stating that the \"lines are not always as funny as Miss Channing makes them\".<ref name=Suskin/> John McClain of the [[New York Journal American]] particularly praised the staging of the musical, saying that\n\n<blockquote>Gower Champion deserves the big gong for performance beyond the call of duty. Seldom has a corps of dancers brought so much style and excitement to a production which could easily have been pedestrian. ... It is difficult to describe the emotion [the song \"Hello, Dolly!\"] produces.

The musical follows the story of Dolly Gallagher Levi, a strong-willed matchmaker, as she travels to Yonkers, New York to find a match for the miserly \"well-known unmarried half-a-millionaire\" Horace Vandergelder.\n\n''Hello, Dolly!'' first debuted at the [[Fisher Building|Fisher Theater]] in Detroit on November 18, 1963<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/shows/backstage.php?showid=5050|title=Hello, Dolly! - 1964 Broadway - Backstage & Production Info|website=www.broadwayworld.com|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>, directed and choreographed by [[Gower Champion]] and produced by [[David Merrick]], and moved to Broadway in 1964, winning 10 Tony Awards, including Best Musical.

[[Thornton Wilder]] adapted Nestroy's play into his 1938 farcical play ''The Merchant of Yonkers''. That play was a flop, so he revised it and retitled it as ''[[The Matchmaker]]'' in 1955, expanding the role of Dolly (played by [[Ruth Gordon]]).<ref name=London2008>[http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Theatre-Review/hello-dolly-new-wimbledon-theatre-review \"Hello Dolly! \u2013 New Wimbledon Theatre\"] IndieLondon, March 2008</ref>  ''The Matchmaker'' became a hit and was much revived and made into [[The Matchmaker (1958 film)|a 1958 film]] starring [[Shirley Booth]].

Dolly makes a living through what she calls \"meddling\" \u2013 matchmaking and numerous sidelines, including dance instruction and [[mandolin]] lessons (\"I Put My Hand In\").  She is currently seeking a wife for grumpy Horace Vandergelder, the well-known half-a-millionaire, but it becomes clear that Dolly intends to marry Horace herself.  Ambrose Kemper, a young artist, wants to marry Horace's weepy niece Ermengarde, but Horace opposes this because Ambrose's vocation does not guarantee a steady living.  Ambrose enlists Dolly's help, and they travel to [[Yonkers, New York]] to visit Horace, who is a prominent citizen there and owns Vandergelder's Hay and Feed.\n\nHorace explains to his two clerks, Cornelius Hackl and Barnaby Tucker, that he is going to get married because \"It Takes a Woman\" to cheerfully do all the household chores.  He plans to travel with Dolly to New York City to march in the Fourteenth Street Association Parade and propose to the widow Irene Molloy, who owns a hat shop there.  Dolly arrives in Yonkers and \"accidentally\" mentions that Irene's first husband might not have died of natural causes, and also mentions that she knows an heiress, Ernestina Money, who may be interested in Horace.  Horace leaves for New York and leaves Cornelius and Barnaby to run the store.\n\nCornelius decides that he and Barnaby need to get out of Yonkers.  They'll go to New York, have a good meal, spend all their money, see the stuffed whale in Barnum's museum, almost get arrested, and each kiss a girl!  They blow up some tomato cans to create a terrible stench and a pretext to close the store.  Dolly mentions that she knows two ladies in New York they should call on: Irene Molloy and her shop assistant, Minnie Fay.  She tells Ermengarde and Ambrose that she'll enter them in the [[polka]] competition at the upscale Harmonia Gardens Restaurant in New York City so Ambrose can demonstrate his ability to be a breadwinner to Horace.  Cornelius, Barnaby, Ambrose, Ermengarde and Dolly take the train to New York (\"Put on Your Sunday Clothes\").\n\nIrene and Minnie open their hat shop for the afternoon.  Irene wants a husband, but does not love Horace Vandergelder.  She declares that she will wear an elaborate hat to impress a gentleman (\"Ribbons Down My Back\").  Cornelius and Barnaby arrive at the shop and pretend to be rich.  Horace and Dolly arrive at the shop, and Cornelius and Barnaby hide from him.  Irene inadvertently mentions that she knows Cornelius Hackl, and Dolly tells her and Horace that even though Cornelius is Horace's clerk by day, he's a New York playboy by night; he's one of ''the'' Hackls.  Minnie screams when she finds Cornelius hiding in the armoire.  Horace is about to open the armoire himself, but Dolly, Irene and Minnie distract him with patriotic sentiments related to subjects like Betsy Ross and The Battle of the Alamo shown in the famous lyrics \"Alamo, remember the Alamo!\" (\"Motherhood March\"). Cornelius sneezes, and Horace storms out, realizing there are men hiding in the shop, but not knowing they are his clerks.\n\nDolly arranges for Cornelius and Barnaby, who are still pretending to be rich, to take the ladies out to dinner to the Harmonia Gardens restaurant to make up for their humiliation.  She teaches Cornelius and Barnaby how to dance since they always have dancing at such establishments (\"Dancing\").  Soon, Cornelius, Irene, Barnaby, and Minnie are happily dancing.  They go to watch the great 14th Street Association Parade together.  Alone, Dolly decides to put her dear departed husband Ephram behind her and to move on with life \"Before the Parade Passes By\".  She asks Ephram's permission to marry Horace, requesting a sign from him.  Dolly catches up with the annoyed Vandergelder, who has missed the whole parade, and she convinces him to give her matchmaking one more chance.  She tells him that Ernestina Money would be perfect for him and asks him to meet her at the swanky Harmonia Gardens that evening.\n\n===Act II===\n[[File:Carol Channing Hello Dolly 1966.jpg|thumb|right|Milo Boulton and [[Carol Channing]] in one of several national tours, 1966 ]]\nCornelius is determined to get a kiss before the night is over, but Barnaby isn't so sure.  As the clerks have no money for a carriage, they tell the girls that walking to the restaurant shows that they've got \"Elegance\".  At the Harmonia Gardens Restaurant, Rudolph, the head waiter, prepares his service crew for Dolly Gallagher Levi's return: their usual lightning service, he tells them, must be \"twice as lightning\" (\"The Waiters' Gallop\").  Horace arrives with his date, but she proves neither as rich nor as elegant as Dolly had implied; furthermore she is soon bored by Horace and leaves, as Dolly had planned she would.\n\nCornelius, Barnaby, and their dates arrive, unaware that Horace is also dining at the restaurant.  Irene and Minnie, inspired by the restaurant's opulence, order the menu's most expensive items. Cornelius and Barnaby grow increasingly anxious as they discover they have little more than a dollar left. Dolly makes her triumphant return to the Harmonia Gardens and is greeted in style by the staff (\"Hello, Dolly!\") She sits in the now-empty seat at Horace's table and proceeds to eat a large, expensive dinner, telling the exasperated Horace that no matter what he says, she will not marry him. Barnaby and Horace hail waiters at the same time, and in the ensuing confusion each drops his wallet and inadvertently picks up the other's. Barnaby is delighted that he can now pay the restaurant bill, while Horace finds only a little spare change.  Barnaby and Cornelius realize that the wallet must belong to Horace. Cornelius, Irene, Barnaby and Minnie try to sneak out during \"The [[Polka]] Contest\", but Horace recognizes them and spots Ermengarde and Ambrose as well. The ensuing free-for-all culminates in a trip to night court.\n\nCornelius and Barnaby confess that they have no money and have never been to New York before. Cornelius declares that even if he has to dig ditches the rest of his life, he'll never forget the day because he had met Irene. Cornelius, Barnaby, and Ambrose then each profess their love for their companion (\"It Only Takes A Moment\"). Dolly convinces the judge that their only crime was being in love. The judge finds everyone innocent and cleared of all charges, but Horace is declared guilty and forced to pay damages. Dolly mentions marriage again, and Horace declares that he wouldn't marry her if she were the last woman in the world.  Dolly angrily bids him \"So Long, Dearie\", telling him that while he's bored and lonely, she'll be living the high life.\n\nThe next morning, back at the hay and feed store, Cornelius and Irene, Barnaby and Minnie, and Ambrose and Ermengarde each set out on new life's paths.  A chastened Horace Vandergelder finally admits that he needs Dolly in his life, but Dolly is unsure about the marriage until her late husband sends her a sign.  Vandergelder spontaneously repeats a saying of Ephram's: \"Money is like manure. It's not worth a thing unless it's spread about, encouraging young things to grow.\"  Horace tells Dolly life would be dull without her, and she promises in return that she'll \"never go away again\" (\"Hello, Dolly\" (reprise)).\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dolly Gallagher Levi''': A widow in her middle years who has decided to begin her life again.

In his review of the opening night performance, ''[[The New York Times]]'' theatre critic Howard Taubman wrote\n\n<blockquote>''Hello, Dolly!'' ... has qualities of freshness and imagination that are rare in the run of our machine-made musicals. It transmutes the broadly stylized mood of a mettlesome farce into the gusto and colors of the musical stage. ...  Mr. Herman's songs are brisk and pointed and always tuneful ... a shrewdly mischievous performance by Carol Channing. ...  Making the necessary reservations for the unnecessary vulgar and frenzied touches, one is glad to welcome ''Hello, Dolly!'' for its warmth, color and high spirits.<ref>Taubman, Howard. [http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?html_title=&tols_title=HELLO,%20DOLLY!%20(PLAY)&pdate=19640117&byline=By%20HOWARD%20TAUBMAN&id=1077011430206 \"Hello Dolly!\"]. ''The New York Times'', 1964</ref></blockquote>\n\nJohn Chapman of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' lauded Carol Channing's performance, declaring her \"the most outgoing woman on the musical stage today \u2013 big and warm, all eyes and smiles, in love with everybody in the theatre and possessing a unique voice ranging somewhat upward from a ''basso profundo''.\"  He also wrote, \"I wouldn't say that Jerry Herman's score is memorable.\"<ref name=Suskin>Suskin, Steven. ''Opening Night on Broadway: A Critical Quotebook of the Golden Era of the Musical Theatre'', pp. 297\u2013301. Schirmer Books, New York, 1990. {{ISBN|0-02-872625-1}}</ref> [[New York Post]] critic Richard Watts, Jr., wrote,\n\n<blockquote>The fact that [''Hello, Dolly!''] seems to me short on charm, warmth, and the intangible quality of distinction in no way alters my conviction that it will be an enormous popular success. Herman has composed a score that is always pleasant and agreeably tuneful, although the only number that comes to mind at the moment is the lively title song. His lyrics could be called serviceable.<ref name=Suskin/></blockquote>\n\nIn the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', [[Walter Kerr]] wrote,\n\n<blockquote>''Hello, Dolly!'' is a musical comedy dream, with Carol Channing the girl of it. ... Channing opens wide her big-as-millstone eyes, spreads her white-gloved arms in ecstatic abandon, trots out on a circular runway that surrounds the orchestra, and proceeds to dance rings around the conductor. ... With hair like orange sea foam, a contralto like a horse's neighing, and a confidential swagger, [she is] a musical comedy performer with all the blowzy glamor of the girls on the sheet music of 1916.</blockquote>\n\nKerr perceived deficiencies in the libretto, though, stating that the \"lines are not always as funny as Miss Channing makes them\".<ref name=Suskin/> John McClain of the [[New York Journal American]] particularly praised the staging of the musical, saying that\n\n<blockquote>Gower Champion deserves the big gong for performance beyond the call of duty. Seldom has a corps of dancers brought so much style and excitement to a production which could easily have been pedestrian. ... It is difficult to describe the emotion [the song \"Hello, Dolly!\"] produces. Last night the audience nearly tore up the seats as she led the parade of waiters in a series of encores over the semi-circular runway that extends around the orchestra pit out into the audience, ... a tribute to the personal appeal of Miss Channing and the magical inventiveness of Mr. Champion's staging.<ref name=Suskin/></blockquote>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n===Original Broadway production===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:25%;\"| Award \n! style=\"width:40%;\"| Category\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Nominee\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1964\n| [[New York Drama Critics Circle|New York Drama Critics Circle Award]]<ref>[http://www.dramacritics.org/dc_pastawards.html#1964 \"New York Drama Critics Past Awards, 1964\"] dramacritics.org, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| colspan=\"2\"| Best Musical\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"11\"| [[Tony Award]]<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=2810 \" 'Hello Dolly' Listing, 1964\u20131970\"] Internet Broadway Database, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1964 \"Tony Awards, 1964\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105101119/http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1964 |date=2012-01-05 }} broadwayworld.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0153433.html \"Tony Award Winners, 1964\"] infoplease.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| colspan=\"2\"| [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical|Best Book of a Musical]]\n| [[Michael Stewart (playwright)|Michael Stewart]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical|Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical]]\n| [[Carol Channing]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical|Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical]]\n| [[Charles Nelson Reilly]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]\n| [[Jerry Herman]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award|Best Producer of a Musical]]\n| [[David Merrick]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical|Best Direction of a Musical]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[Gower Champion]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Choreography|Best Choreography]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Conductor and Musical Director|Best Conductor and Musical Director]]\n| Shepard Coleman\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Scenic Design|Best Scenic Design]]\n| [[Oliver Smith (designer)|Oliver Smith]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]\n| [[Freddy Wittop]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1968\n| [[Special Tony Award]]<ref>[http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1968 \"Tony Awards, 1968\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407225811/http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1968 |date=2016-04-07 }} broadwayworld.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=30650 \"Pearl Bailey Listing, Awards and Nominations\"] Internet Broadway Database, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0153442.html \"Tony Award Winners, 1968\"] infoplease.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| Special Award\n| [[Pearl Bailey]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1970\n| [[Drama Desk Award]]<ref>[http://www.dramadesk.org/1969_1970dd.html \"Drama Desk, 1969\u20131970\"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} dramadesk.org, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>Flinn, Caryl.

The topic has been a subject of debate, with various public health agencies and governments disagreeing on a protocol for wearing face masks.

Additionally, public health agencies of different countries and territories have often changed their recommendations regarding face masks over time.<ref name=\"mask_not_mask\"/> Face masks have been a subject of [[shortage]]s, and also been made compulsory in some countries. \n\nTypes of face masks, from least to most protective, include [[cloth face mask]]s, medical (non-surgical) masks,<ref name=\"nhc_masks\" /><ref name=20200402businessinsider/> [[surgical masks]], and filtering facepiece [[respirator]]s such as [[N95 mask]]s and [[FFP mask]]s.
