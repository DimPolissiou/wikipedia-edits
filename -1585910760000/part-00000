It is aimed at pre-school children, and concerns the adventures of Pat Clifton, a [[postman]] in the fictional village of Greendale (inspired by the real valley of [[Longsleddale]] in [[Cumbria]]).<ref>{{cite news|title=Postman Pat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cumbria/content/articles/2006/03/30/cumbriaonfilm_postman_pat_feature.shtml|accessdate=20 December 2011|newspaper=BBC|date=30 March 2006}}</ref>\n\n''Postman Pat'''s first 13-episode season was screened on [[BBC1]] between 1981 and 1982. [[John Cunliffe (author)|John Cunliffe]] wrote the original treatment and scripts, and it was directed by animator [[Ivor Wood]], who also worked on ''[[The Magic Roundabout]]'', [[Paddington (1975 TV series)|Paddington]], and ''[[The Herbs]]''. Following the success of the first season, and that of several TV specials in between, a second season of 13 episodes was produced by the same crew in 1996. Here, Pat had a family for the first time. A new version of the series has been produced by [[Cosgrove Hall]] from September 2004, which expanded on many aspects of the original series.  For the first time in the programme's history, ''Postman Pat'' was no longer sponsored by the [[Royal Mail]], which previously had used the show as a marketing vehicle for them. This link was dropped in November 2000, with the Royal Mail spokesman saying the character no longer fitted in with the company's \"corporate image.\" <ref>BBC News, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1031114.stm \"Postman Pat gets the Sack\"], 19 Nov 2000.</ref>\n\n==Episode list==\nThe episode number follows the first broadcast order.\n\n===1981 TV Series===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! width=\"8%\" | Episode #\n! width=\"8%\" | Series #\n! width=\"23%\" | Episode Title\n! width=\"18%\" | Original airdate\n|-\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=1\n|EpisodeNumber2=1\n|Title=Postman Pat's Finding Day\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1981|09|16|df=y}}\n|ShortSummary=Pat calls to the Post Office and today most of the post is for Katy and Tom because it is their birthday.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=2\n|EpisodeNumber2=2\n|Title=Postman Pat and the Magpie Hen\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1981|09|23|df=y}}\n|ShortSummary=Pat stops for a picnic lunch near Thompson Ground halfway through his round and a hen steals his sandwich and keys.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=3\n|EpisodeNumber2=3\n|Title=Postman Pat's Secret Birthday\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1981|09|30|df=y}}\n|ShortSummary=Pat always thought he had managed to keep the date of his birthday to himself.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=4\n|EpisodeNumber2=4\n|Title=Pat's Rainy Day\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1981|10|07|df=y}}\n|ShortSummary=It was a heavy rainy day in Greendale.

It is aimed at pre-school children, and concerns the adventures of Pat Clifton, a [[postman]] in the fictional village of Greendale (inspired by the real valley of [[Longsleddale]] in [[Cumbria]]).<ref>{{cite news|title=Postman Pat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cumbria/content/articles/2006/03/30/cumbriaonfilm_postman_pat_feature.shtml|accessdate=20 December 2011|newspaper=BBC|date=30 March 2006}}</ref>\n\n''Postman Pat'''s first 13-episode season was screened on [[BBC1]] between 1981 and 1982. [[John Cunliffe (author)|John Cunliffe]] wrote the original treatment and scripts, and it was directed by animator [[Ivor Wood]], who also worked on ''[[The Magic Roundabout]]'', [[Paddington (1975 TV series)|Paddington]], and ''[[The Herbs]]''. Following the success of the first season, and that of several TV specials in between, a second season of 13 episodes was produced by the same crew in 1996. Here, Pat had a family for the first time. A new version of the series has been produced by [[Cosgrove Hall]] from September 2004, which expanded on many aspects of the original series.  For the first time in the programme's history, ''Postman Pat'' was no longer sponsored by the [[Royal Mail]], which previously had used the show as a marketing vehicle for them. This link was dropped in November 2000, with the Royal Mail spokesman saying the character no longer fitted in with the company's \"corporate image.\" <ref>BBC News, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1031114.stm \"Postman Pat gets the Sack\"], 19 Nov 2000.</ref>\n\n==Episode list==\nThe episode number follows the first broadcast order.\n\n===1981 TV Series===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! width=\"8%\" | Episode #\n! width=\"8%\" | Series #\n! width=\"23%\" | Episode Title\n! width=\"18%\" | Original airdate\n|-\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=1\n|EpisodeNumber2=1\n|Title=Postman Pat's Finding Day\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1981|09|16|df=y}}\n|ShortSummary=Pat calls to the Post Office and today most of the post is for Katy and Tom because it is their birthday.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=2\n|EpisodeNumber2=2\n|Title=Postman Pat and the Magpie Hen\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1981|09|23|df=y}}\n|ShortSummary=Pat stops for a picnic lunch near Thompson Ground halfway through his round and a hen steals his sandwich and keys.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=3\n|EpisodeNumber2=3\n|Title=Postman Pat's Secret Birthday\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1981|09|30|df=y}}\n|ShortSummary=Pat always thought he had managed to keep the date of his birthday to himself.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=4\n|EpisodeNumber2=4\n|Title=Pat's Rainy Day\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1981|10|07|df=y}}\n|ShortSummary=It was a heavy rainy day in Greendale.

The A3070 sensor suffered from an issue known as pixel jitter compensation; one units worth (a single pixel in the context of a GUI desktop with a 1:1 mouse input/output ratio) of accurate movement was lost immediately after reversing the physical direction of travel of the Diamondback, resulting in the 'skipping' of the mouse pointer. This issue only occurred at high sensitivity settings, and could be largely negated with the use of a software fix (programmed by a helpful Razer user going by the name of \"Atalan\"), made available as a patch and in Razers drivers. Later runs of the Diamondback used the A3080 sensor which did not suffer from this issue.</ref>\n| 1600\n| \n| \n| USB\n| 125\n| 90\n| 129 \u00d7 63 \u00d7 38.5\n| 3/4\n| {{No}}\n| {{No}}\n| Ambidextrous\n| {{Yes|Blue}}\n|-\n!

Viper\n| 2004 April\n| Optical\n| Agilent A2051<ref group=lower-alpha>Razer used a lens with a magnification factor greater than that recommended by Agilent to obtain an effective 1000 DPI resolution from the 800 DPI A2051 sensor, giving a lower maximum tracking speed. As a result, users who preferred a lower sensitivity setting (requiring greater/faster physical movement of the mouse) found the Viper unusable.</ref>\n| 1000\n| \n|\n| USB\n| 125\n| 78\n| 118 \u00d7 55 \u00d7 36\n| 3\n| {{No}}\n| {{No}}\n| Ambidextrous\n| {{Yes|Red}}\n|-\n! Diamondback\n| 2004 Late\n| Optical\n| Agilent A3070/A3080<ref group=lower-alpha>Depending on date of manufacture. The A3070 sensor suffered from an issue known as pixel jitter compensation; one units worth (a single pixel in the context of a GUI desktop with a 1:1 mouse input/output ratio) of accurate movement was lost immediately after reversing the physical direction of travel of the Diamondback, resulting in the 'skipping' of the mouse pointer. This issue only occurred at high sensitivity settings, and could be largely negated with the use of a software fix (programmed by a helpful Razer user going by the name of \"Atalan\"), made available as a patch and in Razers drivers. Later runs of the Diamondback used the A3080 sensor which did not suffer from this issue.</ref>\n| 1600\n| \n| \n| USB\n| 125\n| 90\n| 129 \u00d7 63 \u00d7 38.5\n| 3/4\n| {{No}}\n| {{No}}\n| Ambidextrous\n| {{Yes|Blue}}\n|-\n!

Bishop [[Aleksander Antoni Fredro]] decided to rebuild in the Baroque style, these works were performed in the years 1724-1744. In the chancel of the Great Altar was placed huge baroque and new stalls. There are two domed chapels.

The first single from this album, \"Sexiest Man in Jamaica\", featuring a sample of a [[Prince Buster]] song, became their second UK Top 20 hit. As the band embarked on a series of live shows and a UK tour in 2003, a new single was released, \"Blue Song,\" the video for which featured comedians [[Noel Fielding]] and [[Julian Barratt]], of ''[[The Mighty Boosh]]'' fame, as well as [[Nick Frost]] of ''[[Spaced]]'' and ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' fame and [[Michael Smiley]], also of ''[[Spaced]]''.

The next few months were a turbulent time for Mint Royale with founding member Chris Baker leaving the band. However, Neil and the resident vocalists & musicians returned to the studio to complete the recording of the third album in January 2005 and the result was ''See You In The Morning'' with the then-unknown [[Duffy (singer)|Duffy]] singing on two of the album's songs. In 2005 the group released \"Waiting in the Rain\" on the ''Wait for You'' EP &mdash; a remix of \"[[Singin' in the Rain (UK single)|Singin' in the Rain]]\", which was featured in the  [[Volkswagen Golf]] GTI commercial from 2005. It reached number 20 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] after it was released as a single (remixed and renamed as \"Singing In the Rain\"). This version also features on the album ''See You in the Morning''.\n\nIn 2007, Mint Royale released a compilation CD+DVD named ''[[Pop Is...]]'', which contained all their singles and videos, as well as a couple of the remixes they had done for other performers, and a new song, \"Wham-Bar,\" based on the [[Wham!]] hit song \"[[Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)]]\". The same year, Mint Royale released a bonus track remix of Frank Sinatra's \"[[This Town (Frank Sinatra song)|This Town]]\" on the ''[[Ocean's Thirteen]]'' official soundtrack.\n\nOn 1 June 2008, \"Singin' in the Rain\" re-entered the [[UK Singles Chart]] at number 28 after the success of [[George Sampson]] on ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' and Jack Chambers on ''[[So You Think You Can Dance Australia]]''.

It is part of [[Pollino National Park]].\n\n==Geography==\nPapasidero is situated on a rocky spur 210 m above the sea level and is crossed by Lao and Santo Nocajo rivers. It is 18&nbsp;km from SA-RC motorway and 23&nbsp;km from the Tyrrhenian sea. Its territory covers an area of 54 square km and is entirely part of Pollino National Park.\n\n==History==\nThe name ''Papasidero'' derives from the name of an abbot (in [[Greek language|Greek]] Papas-Isidoros, father or priest Isidore) head of a monastery in the Mercuriense Region, home of Basilian Greek monasticism.\n\nHumans have occupied the area since prehistoric times, as confirmed by an important archaeological site, [[Romito Cave|LaGrotta Romito]], discovered in 1961. The historical centre has a typically medieval urban style. It was built over the 12th and 13th centuries. From Lombard beginnings, it became a fortress castle in the Sveva Norman period (1190\u20131250) and was expanded under the Angioino in the 14th century, and under Aragon (from 1400 to 1500).\n\nThe church of Saint Constantine became a parish in 1510. The place was possessed by the descendants of the Norman Alitto of Sanseverino and Spinelli di Scalea until 1806. Since 1593 a [[Monte di Piet\u00e0]] has operated, set up by [[Owen Lewis (bishop)|Owen Lewis]] (Ludovico Audoeno) who was [[Bishop of Cassano]]; and starting from the 17th century the [[Brotherhood of the Assumption]]. Carlo Paolino (1723\u20131803) humanist, Francesco Mastroti (1777\u20131847) teacher, and Maria Angelica Mastroti (1851\u20131891) mystic, were all born here.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Main sights==\n*The abandoned village of Avena.

It has a T plan with three naves. A large fresco was painted between 700 and 800, depicting the Virgin and Child and a bishop kneeling before the high Archangel Michele who pierces Satan in flames.\n\n===Romito Cave===\n{{Main|Romito Cave}}\nThis important discovery, which occurred in 1961 in the territory of Papasidero, has shed a light on events in prehistoric northern Calabria, and showed that it was inhabited at least 20,000 years ago. The Romito man was a Cro-Magnon; he did not keep cattle or practise agriculture or make ceramics. The cave is divided into two distinct areas: the actual cave, about twenty metres deep, which goes into the limestone formation with a narrow dark tunnel, and the guard{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} that extends for about 34 metres east\u2013west.\n\n''[[Homo sapiens]]'' occupied the cave continuously leaving countless relics of bone and stone tools, wonderful graffiti and their skeletal remains. Carbon 14 dating proves occupation since 4470 BC (Neolithic). In the Upper Paleolithic layers, the oldest dating is around 16,800 BC.\n\nThe figure of a bull, about 1.2 metres long, is engraved on a boulder of about 2.3 metres in length at an angle of 45\u00b0. The design of perfect proportions, is made with stretch safely.{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} The nostrils, mouth, eye and ear are represented with some care. Folds in the skin of the neck are clear and the cloven foot is very accurately shown.\n\nBelow the great figure of a bull, another bovine figure has been cut, much more subtly, showing only the chest, head and part of the back. In front of the rock with the cattle, there is another figure about 3.5 metres long, with a linear cut, whose meaning is incomprehensible. The occupation of the Neolithic cave of Romito ([[:it:Grotta del Romito]]) is documented by the discovery of fifty ceramic pieces that reveal trade in obsidian from the Aeolian Islands. The place of their discovery, and the facsimile of a tomb dated from 9200 years BC, can be visited. Two individuals have been arranged in a well-defined ritual.<ref>A Case of Chondrodystrophic Dwarfism in the Italian Late Upper Paleolithic // American Journal of Physical Anthropology 75:549-565 (1988)</ref><ref>''Mallegni Francesco'', ''Fabbri Pier Francesco''.

Of these pairs of skeletons, the first is kept in the National Museum of Reggio Calabria, the second is in the Florentine Museum of Prehistory. The third is still being studied by the Institute of Prehistory of Florence. Recent excavations have unearthed the remains of a fourth burial, even more ancient, clear evidence of an intense occupation by prehistoric man. About 300 obsidian{{Which|date=January 2012}} chips have been found in the different layers of the shelter and the cave.\n\nThe Archaeological Park contains a small museum, teaching all the essential information.\n\n===Lao River===\nThe Lao river is a short perennial river on the Tyrrhenian side of Calabria. It takes its name from the town of Laos, a city of [[Magna Grecia]].\n\nOver 50&nbsp;km long, it originates in Basilicata from Monte Serra del Prete on the Massif Pollino, 2000m in altitude. It is known in the territory of Viggianello (PZ), as the Mercure. Here the river runs from E-W to NE-SW. Where the tributaries meet the river is named the Lao. From this point there is abundant water throughout the year. It enters a spectacular gorge flowing for several kilometres.\n\nDespite great variations in flow (especially in autumn when it can lead to massive flooding), the Lao is clearly distinguishable from other rivers of the region for its average flow (of about 10&nbsp;m/s) and its minimum (in summer rarely dropping below 4&nbsp;m/s), thanks to the remarkable permeability of a large part of its catchment, making it the most important watercourse of Tyrrhenian Calabria, by volume of water and the most important in summer. Because of these unique characteristics, and for the purity of its waters, and the beauty and length of the Ingoli stretch, the river is popular with fans of rafting and canoeing. The Lao also gives its name to the Riserva Statale Valle del Fiume Lao, established in 1987 within the National Park of Pollino.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n \n{{Province of Cosenza}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Calabria]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=September 2016}}\n{{Infobox Italian comune\n| name                = Papasidero\n| official_name       = Comune di Papasidero\n| native_name         =\n| image_skyline       =Papasidero.jpg\n| imagesize           =\n| image_alt           =\n| image_caption       =\n| image_shield        = Papasidero-Stemma.png\n| shield_alt          =\n| image_map           =\n| map_alt             =\n| map_caption         =\n| pushpin_label_position =\n| pushpin_map_alt     =\n| coordinates         = {{coord|39|52|N|15|54|E|display=inline,title}}\n| coordinates_footnotes =\n| region              = [[Calabria]]\n| province            = [[Province of Cosenza|Cosenza]] (CS)\n| frazioni            = Avena, Tremoli, Montagna, Nuppolara, Santo Nocaio, Vitimoso\n| mayor_party         =\n| mayor               =Fiorenzo Conte\n| area_footnotes      =\n| area_total_km2      = 55.22\n| population_footnotes =\n| population_total    = 671\n| population_as_of    = 31 December 2018\n| pop_density_footnotes =\n| population_demonym  =Papasideresi\n| elevation_footnotes =\n| elevation_m         = 208\n| twin1               =\n| twin1_country       =\n| saint               = St. Roch\n| day                 =\n| postal_code         = 87020\n| area_code           = 0981\n| website             = {{Official website|http://papasideros.altervista.org/}}\n| footnotes           =\n}}\n\n'''Papasidero''' is a village and ''[[comune]]'' in the [[province of Cosenza]] in the [[Calabria]] region, southern [[Italy]].

In the Upper Paleolithic layers, the oldest dating is around 16,800 BC.\n\nThe figure of a bull, about 1.2 metres long, is engraved on a boulder of about 2.3 metres in length at an angle of 45\u00b0. The design of perfect proportions, is made with stretch safely.{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} The nostrils, mouth, eye and ear are represented with some care. Folds in the skin of the neck are clear and the cloven foot is very accurately shown.\n\nBelow the great figure of a bull, another bovine figure has been cut, much more subtly, showing only the chest, head and part of the back. In front of the rock with the cattle, there is another figure about 3.5 metres long, with a linear cut, whose meaning is incomprehensible. The occupation of the Neolithic cave of Romito ([[:it:Grotta del Romito]]) is documented by the discovery of fifty ceramic pieces that reveal trade in obsidian from the Aeolian Islands. The place of their discovery, and the facsimile of a tomb dated from 9200 years BC, can be visited. Two individuals have been arranged in a well-defined ritual.<ref>A Case of Chondrodystrophic Dwarfism in the Italian Late Upper Paleolithic // American Journal of Physical Anthropology 75:549-565 (1988)</ref><ref>''Mallegni Francesco'', ''Fabbri Pier Francesco''.

Of these pairs of skeletons, the first is kept in the National Museum of Reggio Calabria, the second is in the Florentine Museum of Prehistory. The third is still being studied by the Institute of Prehistory of Florence. Recent excavations have unearthed the remains of a fourth burial, even more ancient, clear evidence of an intense occupation by prehistoric man. About 300 obsidian{{Which|date=January 2012}} chips have been found in the different layers of the shelter and the cave.\n\nThe Archaeological Park contains a small museum, teaching all the essential information.\n\n===Lao River===\nThe Lao river is a short perennial river on the Tyrrhenian side of Calabria. It takes its name from the town of Laos, a city of [[Magna Grecia]].\n\nOver 50&nbsp;km long, it originates in Basilicata from Monte Serra del Prete on the Massif Pollino, 2000m in altitude. It is known in the territory of Viggianello (PZ), as the Mercure. Here the river runs from E-W to NE-SW. Where the tributaries meet the river is named the Lao. From this point there is abundant water throughout the year. It enters a spectacular gorge flowing for several kilometres.\n\nDespite great variations in flow (especially in autumn when it can lead to massive flooding), the Lao is clearly distinguishable from other rivers of the region for its average flow (of about 10&nbsp;m/s) and its minimum (in summer rarely dropping below 4&nbsp;m/s), thanks to the remarkable permeability of a large part of its catchment, making it the most important watercourse of Tyrrhenian Calabria, by volume of water and the most important in summer. Because of these unique characteristics, and for the purity of its waters, and the beauty and length of the Ingoli stretch, the river is popular with fans of rafting and canoeing. The Lao also gives its name to the Riserva Statale Valle del Fiume Lao, established in 1987 within the National Park of Pollino.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n \n{{Province of Cosenza}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Calabria]]\n", "name_user": "AngeloDM84ph", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed few typos", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papasidero"}
