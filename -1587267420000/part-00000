Hosted at [[Foxboro Stadium]] in [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]], on October 20, 1996, it was contested by [[D.C. United]] and the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] to decide the champion of the [[1996 Major League Soccer season|1996 season]].\n\nBoth finalists finished in the top two spots of their respective conferences, with D.C. placing second in the East and Los Angeles atop the West. The two teams also had identical [[Winning percentage|win\u2013loss]] records in the first two rounds of the playoffs, losing the opening match of the Conference Semifinals and winning the remaining four matches of both rounds. The final match was played in heavy rain due to the proximity of [[Hurricane Lili (1996)|Hurricane Lili]], which also inundated the field. The MLS Cup had an attendance of 34,643 spectators, falling short of the 42,000 people who paid for tickets, and included a large contingent of traveling D.C. supporters.\n\nThe match ended in a 3\u20132 victory for D.C. United, with a [[golden goal]] scored by [[Eddie Pope]] in overtime that followed a second-half comeback for the team. Los Angeles had taken a 2\u20130 lead in the 56th minute on goals by [[Eduardo Hurtado]] and [[Chris Armas]], but conceded two goals to D.C. in the second half to force overtime. [[Marco Etcheverry]] assisted both goals, which began as [[free kick]]s that were headed into the goal by substitutes [[Tony Sanneh]] and [[Shawn Medved]]. Etcheverry went on to take the [[corner kick]] that led to Pope's goal and was named the [[Player of the match|man of the match]]. The finalists also earned a berth in the [[1997 CONCACAF Champions' Cup]] and met in the semifinals, which ended in a victory for the Galaxy.\n\n==Venue==\n[[File:Foxborostade crop 1.png|thumb|right|Aerial view of [[Foxboro Stadium]], the host venue of MLS Cup 1996|alt=Aerial view of Foxboro Stadium with a soccer field surrounded on two sides by three sets of yellow and blue stands, and on two sides by smaller stands.]]\n\n[[Foxboro Stadium]] in the [[Boston]] suburb of [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]], was announced as the venue of the inaugural MLS Cup during a league press conference on August 29, 1996.

Hosted at [[Foxboro Stadium]] in [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]], on October 20, 1996, it was contested by [[D.C.

The two teams also had identical [[Winning percentage|win\u2013loss]] records in the first two rounds of the playoffs, losing the opening match of the Conference Semifinals and winning the remaining four matches of both rounds. The final match was played in heavy rain due to the proximity of [[Hurricane Lili (1996)|Hurricane Lili]], which also inundated the field. The MLS Cup had an attendance of 34,643 spectators, falling short of the 42,000 people who paid for tickets, and included a large contingent of traveling D.C. supporters.\n\nThe match ended in a 3\u20132 victory for D.C. United, with a [[golden goal]] scored by [[Eddie Pope]] in overtime that followed a second-half comeback for the team. Los Angeles had taken a 2\u20130 lead in the 56th minute on goals by [[Eduardo Hurtado]] and [[Chris Armas]], but conceded two goals to D.C. in the second half to force overtime. [[Marco Etcheverry]] assisted both goals, which began as [[free kick]]s that were headed into the goal by substitutes [[Tony Sanneh]] and [[Shawn Medved]]. Etcheverry went on to take the [[corner kick]] that led to Pope's goal and was named the [[Player of the match|man of the match]]. The finalists also earned a berth in the [[1997 CONCACAF Champions' Cup]] and met in the semifinals, which ended in a victory for the Galaxy.\n\n==Venue==\n[[File:Foxborostade crop 1.png|thumb|right|Aerial view of [[Foxboro Stadium]], the host venue of MLS Cup 1996|alt=Aerial view of Foxboro Stadium with a soccer field surrounded on two sides by three sets of yellow and blue stands, and on two sides by smaller stands.]]\n\n[[Foxboro Stadium]] in the [[Boston]] suburb of [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]], was announced as the venue of the inaugural MLS Cup during a league press conference on August 29, 1996.

{"title_page": "Disease surveillance", "text_new": "{{Short description|Monitoring spread of disease to establish patterns of progression}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2018|cs1-dates=y}}\n'''Disease surveillance''' is an [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] practice by which the spread of [[disease]] is monitored in order to establish patterns of progression. The main role of disease surveillance is to predict, observe, and minimize the harm caused by [[outbreak]], [[epidemic]], and [[pandemic]] situations, as well as increase knowledge about which factors contribute to such circumstances. A key part of modern disease surveillance is the practice of '''disease case reporting'''.\n\nIn modern times, reporting incidences of disease outbreaks has been transformed from manual record keeping, to instant worldwide internet communication.\n\nThe number of cases could be gathered from hospitals&nbsp;\u2013 which would be expected to see most of the occurrences&nbsp;\u2013 collated, and eventually made public. With the advent of modern [[communication technology]], this has changed dramatically. Organizations like the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) now can report cases and deaths from significant diseases within days&nbsp;\u2013 sometimes within hours&nbsp;\u2013 of the occurrence. Further, there is considerable public pressure to make this information available quickly and accurately.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n==Mandatory reporting==\nFormal reporting of [[notifiable disease|notifiable]] infectious diseases is a requirement placed upon health care providers by many regional and national governments, and upon national governments by the World Health Organization to monitor spread as a result of the [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]] of infectious agents. Since 1969, WHO has required that all cases of the following diseases be reported to the organization: [[cholera]], [[bubonic plague|plague]], [[yellow fever]], [[smallpox]], [[relapsing fever]] and [[typhus]]. In 2005, the list was extended to include [[polio]] and [[SARS]].  Regional and national governments typically monitor a larger set of (around 80 in the U.S.) communicable diseases that can potentially threaten the general population. [[Tuberculosis]], [[HIV]], [[botulism]], [[hantavirus]], [[anthrax]], and [[rabies]] are examples of such diseases. The incidence counts of diseases are often used as [[health indicators]] to describe the overall health of a population.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==World Health Organization==\nThe [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) is the lead agency for coordinating global response to major diseases. The WHO maintains Web sites for a number of diseases, and has active teams in many countries where these diseases occur.\n\nDuring the SARS outbreak in early 2004, for example, the [[Beijing]] staff of the WHO produced updates every few days for the duration of the outbreak.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/don/archive/disease/severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome/en/index.html |title=WHO SARS}}</ref> Beginning in January 2004, the WHO has produced similar updates for [[H5N1]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/en/ |title=WHO H5N1}}</ref> These results are [[global spread of H5N1|widely reported]] and closely watched.\n\nWHO's Epidemic and Pandemic Alert and Response (EPR) to detect, verify rapidly and respond appropriately to epidemic-prone and emerging disease threats covers the following diseases:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/en/ |title=WHO EPR}}</ref>\n\n* [[Anthrax]]\n* [[Avian influenza]]\n* [[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever]]\n* [[Dengue hemorrhagic fever]]\n* [[Ebola virus disease]]\n* [[Hepatitis]]\n* [[Influenza]]\n* [[Lassa fever]]\n* [[Marburg virus|Marburg hemorrhagic fever]]\n* [[Meningococcal disease]]\n* [[Bubonic plague|Plague]]\n* [[Rift Valley fever]]\n* [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]] (SARS)\n* [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2]] (SARS-CoV-2)\n* [[Smallpox]]\n* [[Tularaemia]]\n* [[Yellow fever]]\n\n==Political challenges==\nAs the lead organization in global public health, the WHO occupies a delicate role in [[global politics]]. It must maintain good relationships with each of the many countries in which it is active. As a result, it may only report results within a particular country with the agreement of the country's government. Because some governments regard the release of ''any'' information on disease outbreaks as a state secret, this can place the WHO in a difficult position.\n\nThe WHO coordinated ''International Outbreak Alert and Response'' is designed to ensure \"outbreaks of potential international importance are rapidly verified and information is quickly shared within the Network\" but not necessarily by the public; integrate and coordinate \"activities to support national efforts\" rather than challenge national authority within that nation in order to \"respect the independence and objectivity of all partners\". The commitment that \"All Network responses will proceed with full respect for ethical standards, human rights, national and local laws, cultural sensitivities and tradition\" ensures each nation that its security, financial, and other interests will be given full weight.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/outbreaknetwork/guidingprinciples/en/index.html |title=WHO Outbreak Network}}</ref>\n\n==Technical challenges==\nTesting for a disease can be expensive, and distinguishing between two diseases can be prohibitively difficult in many countries. One standard means of determining if a person has had a particular disease is to test for the presence of [[antibodies]] that are particular to this disease. In the case of H5N1, for example, there is a low pathogenic H5N1 strain in wild birds in North America that a human could conceivably have antibodies against. It would be extremely difficult to distinguish between antibodies produced by this strain, and antibodies produced by [[Asian lineage HPAI A(H5N1)]]. Similar difficulties are common, and make it difficult to determine how widely a disease may have spread.\n\nThere is currently little available data on the spread of H5N1 in wild birds in Africa and Asia. Without such data, predicting how the disease might spread in the future is difficult. Information that scientists and decision makers need to make useful medical products and informed decisions for health care, but currently lack include:\n\n* Surveillance of wild bird populations\n* Cell cultures of particular strains of diseases\n\n==H5N1==\nSurveillance of [[H5N1]] in humans, poultry, wild birds, cats and other animals remains very weak in many parts of Asia and Africa. Much remains unknown about the exact extent of its spread.\n\nH5N1 in China is less than fully reported.

The main role of disease surveillance is to predict, observe, and minimize the harm caused by [[outbreak]], [[epidemic]], and [[pandemic]] situations, as well as increase knowledge about which factors contribute to such circumstances. A key part of modern disease surveillance is the practice of '''disease case reporting'''.\n\nIn modern times, reporting incidences of disease outbreaks has been transformed from manual record keeping, to instant worldwide internet communication.\n\nThe number of cases could be gathered from hospitals&nbsp;- which would be expected to see most of the occurrences&nbsp;- collated, and eventually made public. With the advent of modern [[communication technology]], this has changed dramatically. Organizations like the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) now can report cases and deaths from significant diseases within days&nbsp;- sometimes within hours&nbsp;- of the occurrence. Further, there is considerable public pressure to make this information available quickly and accurately.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n==Mandatory reporting==\nFormal reporting of [[notifiable disease|notifiable]] infectious diseases is a requirement placed upon health care providers by many regional and national governments, and upon national governments by the World Health Organization to monitor spread as a result of the [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]] of infectious agents. Since 1969, WHO has required that all cases of the following diseases be reported to the organization: [[cholera]], [[bubonic plague|plague]], [[yellow fever]], [[smallpox]], [[relapsing fever]] and [[typhus]]. In 2005, the list was extended to include [[polio]] and [[SARS]].  Regional and national governments typically monitor a larger set of (around 80 in the U.S.) communicable diseases that can potentially threaten the general population. [[Tuberculosis]], [[HIV]], [[botulism]], [[hantavirus]], [[anthrax]], and [[rabies]] are examples of such diseases. The incidence counts of diseases are often used as [[health indicators]] to describe the overall health of a population.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==World Health Organization==\nThe [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) is the lead agency for coordinating global response to major diseases. The WHO maintains Web sites for a number of diseases, and has active teams in many countries where these diseases occur.\n\nDuring the SARS outbreak in early 2004, for example, the [[Beijing]] staff of the WHO produced updates every few days for the duration of the outbreak.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/don/archive/disease/severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome/en/index.html |title=WHO SARS}}</ref> Beginning in January 2004, the WHO has produced similar updates for [[H5N1]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/en/ |title=WHO H5N1}}</ref> These results are [[global spread of H5N1|widely reported]] and closely watched.\n\nWHO's Epidemic and Pandemic Alert and Response (EPR) to detect, verify rapidly and respond appropriately to epidemic-prone and emerging disease threats covers the following diseases:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/en/ |title=WHO EPR}}</ref>\n\n* [[Anthrax]]\n* [[Avian influenza]]\n* [[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever]]\n* [[Dengue hemorrhagic fever]]\n* [[Ebola virus disease]]\n* [[Hepatitis]]\n* [[Influenza]]\n* [[Lassa fever]]\n* [[Marburg virus|Marburg hemorrhagic fever]]\n* [[Meningococcal disease]]\n* [[Bubonic plague|Plague]]\n* [[Rift Valley fever]]\n* [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]] (SARS)\n* [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2]] (SARS-CoV-2)\n* [[Smallpox]]\n* [[Tularaemia]]\n* [[Yellow fever]]\n\n==Political challenges==\nAs the lead organization in global public health, the WHO occupies a delicate role in [[global politics]]. It must maintain good relationships with each of the many countries in which it is active. As a result, it may only report results within a particular country with the agreement of the country's government. Because some governments regard the release of ''any'' information on disease outbreaks as a state secret, this can place the WHO in a difficult position.\n\nThe WHO coordinated ''International Outbreak Alert and Response'' is designed to ensure \"outbreaks of potential international importance are rapidly verified and information is quickly shared within the Network\" but not necessarily by the public; integrate and coordinate \"activities to support national efforts\" rather than challenge national authority within that nation in order to \"respect the independence and objectivity of all partners\". The commitment that \"All Network responses will proceed with full respect for ethical standards, human rights, national and local laws, cultural sensitivities and tradition\" ensures each nation that its security, financial, and other interests will be given full weight.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/outbreaknetwork/guidingprinciples/en/index.html |title=WHO Outbreak Network}}</ref>\n\n==Technical challenges==\nTesting for a disease can be expensive, and distinguishing between two diseases can be prohibitively difficult in many countries. One standard means of determining if a person has had a particular disease is to test for the presence of [[antibodies]] that are particular to this disease. In the case of H5N1, for example, there is a low pathogenic H5N1 strain in wild birds in North America that a human could conceivably have antibodies against. It would be extremely difficult to distinguish between antibodies produced by this strain, and antibodies produced by [[Asian lineage HPAI A(H5N1)]]. Similar difficulties are common, and make it difficult to determine how widely a disease may have spread.\n\nThere is currently little available data on the spread of H5N1 in wild birds in Africa and Asia. Without such data, predicting how the disease might spread in the future is difficult. Information that scientists and decision makers need to make useful medical products and informed decisions for health care, but currently lack include:\n\n* Surveillance of wild bird populations\n* Cell cultures of particular strains of diseases\n\n==H5N1==\nSurveillance of [[H5N1]] in humans, poultry, wild birds, cats and other animals remains very weak in many parts of Asia and Africa. Much remains unknown about the exact extent of its spread.\n\nH5N1 in China is less than fully reported. Blogs have described many discrepancies between official China government announcements concerning H5N1 and what people in China see with their own eyes. Many reports of total H5N1 cases have excluded China due to widespread disbelief in China's official numbers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/Timeline_28_10a.pdf |title=WHO |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727000000/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/Timeline_28_10a.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-27}} {{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2006_01_19/en/index.html |title=WHO |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213164120/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2006_01_19/en/index.html |archive-date=2006-02-13}} {{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_02_27a/en/index.html |title=WHO}} {{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_07_04/en/ |title=WHO}}</ref> (See [[Disease surveillance in China]].)\n\n\"Only half the world's human bird flu cases are being reported to the World Health Organization within two weeks of being detected, a response time that must be improved to avert a pandemic, a senior WHO official said Saturday.

The changes were planned to take effect with the start of the following season, but a last-minute decision was made to instate them earlier. That meant that the 1999 Cup was the first MLS game ever to not be subject to a tie-breaking shootout.

After the game Fraser argued that he had been fouled when Lassiter pushed him from behind, although no foul was given. Fraser was replaced by [[Steve Jolley]], which prompted the Galaxy to switch to a three-man defensive line with [[Paul Caligiuri]] positioned as [[Sweeper (football)#Sweeper (Libero)|sweeper]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/mls/1999/mls_cup/news/1999/11/21/locker_galaxy/index.html |title=Top MLS defender spends game on sidelines |author= |date= December 19, 1999| publisher = CNN | work = Sports Illustrated |accessdate=June 3, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough not widely publicized at the time, Fraser was wearing a brace throughout the [[1999 Major League Soccer season]] due to shoulder problems. The brace restricted the movement of his shoulder and prevented him from responding quickly to the collision with Lassiter. Rather than bracing the fall with his arm, the majority of the impact was sustained by his shoulder, which led to the broken collarbone. The impact of the substitution is still disputed over ten years later.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/mls-cup-moments/news/article/2011/10/02/top-50-mls-cup-moments-49-broken-dreams |title=Top 50 MLS Cup Moments: #49 Broken Dreams |author= |date=October 2, 2011 |accessdate=October 3, 2011 |work= |publisher=[[Major League Soccer]] }}</ref>\n\nTwelve minutes after Fraser left the field Jaime Moreno gave United a 1\u20130 lead when he scored on a rebounded save by Hartman, which Caligiuri failed to clear.<ref name=\"nyt-19991122\"/>\n\nDuring the four minutes of extra time added by referee [[Tim Weyland]] to the first half D.C. United extended its 1\u20130 lead when [[Ben Olsen]] intercepted a loose ball and scored. MLS goalkeeper of the year, [[Kevin Hartman]] had failed to clear a back pass from substitute defender [[Steve Jolley]]. Although Hartman managed to evade [[Roy Lassiter]], pressure from forward [[Jaime Moreno (footballer, born 1974)|Jaime Moreno]] forced Hartman to attempt a pass to [[Paul Caligiuri]] on the left side of the field. Hartman failed to make contact with the ball, which rolled to Olsen. Olsen struck the ball with a single touch from outside the box, which would be the final goal of the match.<ref name=\"green\"/>\n\nThe Galaxy failed to mount an effective offense. That was partially attributed to [[Richie Williams]], United's defensive midfielder, who disrupted the play of [[Mauricio Cienfuegos]], the Galaxy's playmaker. This was reflected by the fact that United's goalkeeper, [[Tom Presthus]], was forced to make only one save during the championship game.<ref name=\"nyt-19991122\"/>\n\n===Details===\n{{football box\n|date=November 21, 1999\n|time=20:30\n|team1=[[Los Angeles Galaxy]]\n|score=0\u20132\n|report= [https://www.mlssoccer.com/history/mls-cup/1999 Report]\n|team2=[[D.C.

The changes were planned to take effect with the start of the following season, but a last-minute decision was made to instate them earlier. That meant that the 1999 Cup was the first MLS game ever to not be subject to a tie-breaking shootout. Instead penalty kicks would be used to settle the game if drawn after two 15-minute periods of overtime.<ref name=\"litterer\">{{cite web |url=http://white.sover.net/~spectrum/year/1999.html |title=The Year in American Soccer, 1999 |author=Dave Litterer |accessdate=October 5, 2011 |work=The American Soccer History Archives |publisher= }}</ref>\n\n== Match ==\nSeven minutes into the match MLS defender of the year and Best XI selection [[Robin Fraser]] was substituted out of the game after suffering a broken left collarbone. The injury was sustained when Fraser competed with D.C. United forward, [[Roy Lassiter]], for the ball in the corner of the field. After the game Fraser argued that he had been fouled when Lassiter pushed him from behind, although no foul was given. Fraser was replaced by [[Steve Jolley]], which prompted the Galaxy to switch to a three-man defensive line with [[Paul Caligiuri]] positioned as [[Sweeper (football)#Sweeper (Libero)|sweeper]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/mls/1999/mls_cup/news/1999/11/21/locker_galaxy/index.html |title=Top MLS defender spends game on sidelines |author= |date= December 19, 1999| publisher = CNN | work = Sports Illustrated |accessdate=June 3, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough not widely publicized at the time, Fraser was wearing a brace throughout the [[1999 Major League Soccer season]] due to shoulder problems. The brace restricted the movement of his shoulder and prevented him from responding quickly to the collision with Lassiter. Rather than bracing the fall with his arm, the majority of the impact was sustained by his shoulder, which led to the broken collarbone. The impact of the substitution is still disputed over ten years later.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/mls-cup-moments/news/article/2011/10/02/top-50-mls-cup-moments-49-broken-dreams |title=Top 50 MLS Cup Moments: #49 Broken Dreams |author= |date=October 2, 2011 |accessdate=October 3, 2011 |work= |publisher=[[Major League Soccer]] }}</ref>\n\nTwelve minutes after Fraser left the field Jaime Moreno gave United a 1\u20130 lead when he scored on a rebounded save by Hartman, which Caligiuri failed to clear.<ref name=\"nyt-19991122\"/>\n\nDuring the four minutes of extra time added by referee [[Tim Weyland]] to the first half D.C. United extended its 1\u20130 lead when [[Ben Olsen]] intercepted a loose ball and scored. MLS goalkeeper of the year, [[Kevin Hartman]] had failed to clear a back pass from substitute defender [[Steve Jolley]]. Although Hartman managed to evade [[Roy Lassiter]], pressure from forward [[Jaime Moreno (footballer, born 1974)|Jaime Moreno]] forced Hartman to attempt a pass to [[Paul Caligiuri]] on the left side of the field. Hartman failed to make contact with the ball, which rolled to Olsen. Olsen struck the ball with a single touch from outside the box, which would be the final goal of the match.<ref name=\"green\"/>\n\nThe Galaxy failed to mount an effective offense. That was partially attributed to [[Richie Williams]], United's defensive midfielder, who disrupted the play of [[Mauricio Cienfuegos]], the Galaxy's playmaker. This was reflected by the fact that United's goalkeeper, [[Tom Presthus]], was forced to make only one save during the championship game.<ref name=\"nyt-19991122\"/>\n\n===Details===\n{{football box\n|date=November 21, 1999\n|time=20:30\n|team1=[[Los Angeles Galaxy]]\n|score=0\u20132\n|report= [https://www.mlssoccer.com/history/mls-cup/1999 Report]\n|team2=[[D.C.

United forward [[Jaime Moreno (footballer, born 1974)|Jaime Moreno]] threatened early with a shot over Chicago's crossbar within the first minute. Chicago's first goal arrived after 29 minutes, following a quick exchange between Polish international [[Piotr Nowak]] and [[Ante Razov]] just inside the corner of D.C.'s 18-yard box. The move lured United goalkeeper [[Tom Presthus]] off his line, at which point Nowak passed across the box to oncoming Fire midfielder [[Jerzy Podbro\u017cny]] who scored an easy tap-in at the back post. Nowak almost scored a second goal when his 45th minute shot deflected off the body of his teammate, [[Diego Gutierrez (soccer)|Diego Guti\u00e9rrez]]. Nowak was credited with his second assist of the match, and Chicago headed into the second half with all the momentum and maintained the clean sheet on the way to the club's first league championship. [[Chris Armas]] played a significant role in his team's victory by neutralizing the playmaking ability of roaming midfielder [[Marco Etcheverry]], a key ball distributor in United's attack and the league leader in assists that season. MLS Goalkeeper of the Year [[Zach Thornton]] was prolific with 8 saves on the day, including 3 from previous [[MLS Golden Boot]] winner and United's leading scorer, [[Roy Lassiter]].\n\n===Details===\n{{football box\n|date = October 25, 1998\n|time = 15:30 [[Pacific Standard Time|PST]]\n|team1 = [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]]\n|score = 2\u20130\n|report= [https://www.mlssoccer.com/history/mls-cup/1998 Report]\n|team2 = [[D.C.

United forward [[Jaime Moreno (footballer, born 1974)|Jaime Moreno]] threatened early with a shot over Chicago's crossbar within the first minute. Chicago's first goal arrived after 29 minutes, following a quick exchange between Polish international [[Piotr Nowak]] and [[Ante Razov]] just inside the corner of D.C.'s 18-yard box. The move lured United goalkeeper [[Tom Presthus]] off his line, at which point Nowak passed across the box to oncoming Fire midfielder [[Jerzy Podbro\u017cny]] who scored an easy tap-in at the back post. Nowak almost scored a second goal when his 45th minute shot deflected off the body of his teammate, [[Diego Gutierrez (soccer)|Diego Guti\u00e9rrez]]. Nowak was credited with his second assist of the match, and Chicago headed into the second half with all the momentum and maintained the clean sheet on the way to the club's first league championship. [[Chris Armas]] played a significant role in his team's victory by neutralizing the playmaking ability of roaming midfielder [[Marco Etcheverry]], a key ball distributor in United's attack and the league leader in assists that season. MLS Goalkeeper of the Year [[Zach Thornton]] was prolific with 8 saves on the day, including 3 from previous [[MLS Golden Boot]] winner and United's leading scorer, [[Roy Lassiter]].\n\n===Details===\n{{football box\n|date = October 25, 1998\n|time = 15:30 [[Pacific Standard Time|PST]]\n|team1 = [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]]\n|score = 2\u20130\n|report= [https://www.mlssoccer.com/history/mls-cup/1998 Report]\n|team2 = [[D.C.

The latter half of the season explored her developing role, such as encouraging Huey to explore more varied activities and grounding Louie after his latest get-rich-quick scheme to steal lost treasures from the past nearly causes a serious temporal paradox. In the season two finale, the Moon aliens Della encountered attempt to mount an invasion using technology reverse-engineered from Della's rocket, but although she tries to hide her children away, the returned Donald convinces her to join them in fighting off the invasion, leaving the alien mothership stuck in orbit between Earth and the Moon while the rest of the invasion fleet surrender.\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Voice===\nDella's first speaking appearance was in the season 1 finale of 2017's ''DuckTales''.

In the Dutch comic ''80 is Prachtig!'', Della is depicted in flashbacks as a brave and adventurous pilot. In fact, she first declared she wanted to be a pilot at the same time her brother Donald declared he wanted to be a sailor. Della's accomplishments as a pilot included being the first female pilot to fly across the Atlantic, flying as a test pilot (and successfully landing a plane that caught fire), and piloting an experimental rocket ship. She is also depicted as caring about and missing her family while she was adventuring. Due to the effects of [[time dilation]] from Della's near-lightspeed rocket travel while Huey, Dewey, and Louie lived with Donald for several years, Della believed she had been gone for less than an hour. Through radio transmissions, Della revealed she was eager to finish her test flight and get home to her boys, unaware that several more years will pass on Earth by the time she does so.<ref name=\"80 is Prachtig\"/>\n\nIn 2017's ''DuckTales'', Della is similarly depicted as an adventurous pilot and as a mother who cares for and loves her family,<ref name=\"Den of Geek 2020.03.09\"/> but the show also establishes that Della shares personality traits with the new series' versions of her relatives.<ref name=\"AVClub What Ever Happened\"/> Like her twin brother Donald, Della can be temperamental. For example, after seeing a taunting illustration by [[Gyro Gearloose]] in a rocket instruction manual, Della flies into a rage; not only tearing the manual apart, but also stomping on the remains.<ref name=\"AVClub What Ever Happened\"/> Della also shares personality traits with her sons, including their fearlessness and mischief. These common traits are what allow them to accept and bond with her once she returns home.<ref name=\"GMA Della Inspires\"/> Like her son Huey, Della was a [[Junior Woodchucks|Junior Woodchuck]], as evidenced by her bringing her Junior Woodchuck Guidebook with her to the moon and quoting Junior Woodchuck rules by heart.<ref name=\"NostalgiaSpot Della Comes Home\"/><ref name=\"What Ever Happened to Della Duck?!\"/><ref name=\"Nothing Can Stop Della Duck!\">{{cite episode|title=Nothing Can Stop Della Duck!|series=DuckTales|airdate=May 13, 2019|season=2|number=35}}</ref> Della also shares Dewey's adventurous spirit and Louie's quick-talking cleverness.<ref name=\"AVClub What Ever Happened\"/>\n\nFurthermore, Della is also shown to have an unstoppable attitude. This is established early in \"What Ever Happened to Della Duck?!\", which opens with Della having crashed her rocket on the moon, and awakening to her leg trapped underneath the wreckage. After seeing a photo of her family and assessing the situation, she determines the wreckage is too heavy for her to move on her own, amputates her leg, and declares her intent to return home.<ref name=\"What Ever Happened to Della Duck?!\"/><ref name=\"AVClub What Ever Happened\"/><ref name=\"EW DT Keeps Getting Better\"/> As described by ''DuckTales'' producer Francisco Angones, \"she's gonna beat every odd, she's gonna take charge of her decisions.

In the season two finale, the Moon aliens Della encountered attempt to mount an invasion using technology reverse-engineered from Della's rocket, but although she tries to hide her children away, the returned Donald convinces her to join them in fighting off the invasion, leaving the alien mothership stuck in orbit between Earth and the Moon while the rest of the invasion fleet surrender.\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Voice===\nDella's first speaking appearance was in the season 1 finale of 2017's ''DuckTales''.

This isn't a perfect line drawing of someone; it's an interesting, deep character, and I think it gives kids the opportunity to see that you don't always have to be right, or perfect, or a superhero. You can have strengths and you can have weaknesses, and they're both of equal value if you are honest with who you are and do the best you can, and I think that Della Duck sort of embodies that. |author=Paget Brewster, voice of Della Duck |source=''Entertainment Tonight'' interview<ref name=\"ET Paget Dishes\"/>}}\n\nLittle is known of Della's personality prior to the 2017 ''DuckTales'' series. In the Dutch comic ''80 is Prachtig!'', Della is depicted in flashbacks as a brave and adventurous pilot. In fact, she first declared she wanted to be a pilot at the same time her brother Donald declared he wanted to be a sailor. Della's accomplishments as a pilot included being the first female pilot to fly across the Atlantic, flying as a test pilot (and successfully landing a plane that caught fire), and piloting an experimental rocket ship. She is also depicted as caring about and missing her family while she was adventuring. Due to the effects of [[time dilation]] from Della's near-lightspeed rocket travel while Huey, Dewey, and Louie lived with Donald for several years, Della believed she had been gone for less than an hour. Through radio transmissions, Della revealed she was eager to finish her test flight and get home to her boys, unaware that several more years will pass on Earth by the time she does so.<ref name=\"80 is Prachtig\"/>\n\nIn 2017's ''DuckTales'', Della is similarly depicted as an adventurous pilot and as a mother who cares for and loves her family,<ref name=\"Den of Geek 2020.03.09\"/> but the show also establishes that Della shares personality traits with the new series' versions of her relatives.<ref name=\"AVClub What Ever Happened\"/> Like her twin brother Donald, Della can be temperamental. For example, after seeing a taunting illustration by [[Gyro Gearloose]] in a rocket instruction manual, Della flies into a rage; not only tearing the manual apart, but also stomping on the remains.<ref name=\"AVClub What Ever Happened\"/> Della also shares personality traits with her sons, including their fearlessness and mischief. These common traits are what allow them to accept and bond with her once she returns home.<ref name=\"GMA Della Inspires\"/> Like her son Huey, Della was a [[Junior Woodchucks|Junior Woodchuck]], as evidenced by her bringing her Junior Woodchuck Guidebook with her to the moon and quoting Junior Woodchuck rules by heart.<ref name=\"NostalgiaSpot Della Comes Home\"/><ref name=\"What Ever Happened to Della Duck?!\"/><ref name=\"Nothing Can Stop Della Duck!\">{{cite episode|title=Nothing Can Stop Della Duck!|series=DuckTales|airdate=May 13, 2019|season=2|number=35}}</ref> Della also shares Dewey's adventurous spirit and Louie's quick-talking cleverness.<ref name=\"AVClub What Ever Happened\"/>\n\nFurthermore, Della is also shown to have an unstoppable attitude. This is established early in \"What Ever Happened to Della Duck?!\", which opens with Della having crashed her rocket on the moon, and awakening to her leg trapped underneath the wreckage. After seeing a photo of her family and assessing the situation, she determines the wreckage is too heavy for her to move on her own, amputates her leg, and declares her intent to return home.<ref name=\"What Ever Happened to Della Duck?!\"/><ref name=\"AVClub What Ever Happened\"/><ref name=\"EW DT Keeps Getting Better\"/> As described by ''DuckTales'' producer Francisco Angones, \"she's gonna beat every odd, she's gonna take charge of her decisions. She made the choice to amputate her leg [on the moon] and it proved, nothing would stop her.\"<ref name=\"GMA Della Inspires\"/>\n\nWhile Della is tenacious and determined, after finally making it back home, she struggles with returning to civilization and her family. While she has ample experience as an adventurer, she had little experience being a mom, and needed time to adjust to the responsibilities of being a parent.<ref name=\"AVClub Nothing Can Stop\">{{cite web |url=https://tv.avclub.com/della-duck-finally-returns-home-in-an-emotional-advent-1834534925 |title=Della Duck finally returns home in an emotional, adventurous, Mother's Day ''DuckTales'' |last=Johnson |first=Kevin |publisher=[[The A.V.
