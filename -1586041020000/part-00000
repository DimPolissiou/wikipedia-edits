These three protect their state from supervillains including evil Baron Blitz, and the shape-changing [[femme fatale]] known as Madame Snake.\n\nThe series debuted on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] as part of [[ABC Kids (United States)|Disney's One Saturday Morning]] block on January 19, 2002, where most of its first season aired. However, it started regularly airing on [[Toon Disney]] in September of that same year, where most of its second season premiered. During the spring of 2003, about half of its second season premiered on what had been by then renamed ABC Kids. In September 2003, it was taken off ABC Kids, leaving the rest of the episodes to premiere on Toon Disney, ending its run by 2004. Thirty-nine episodes were made, with 76 total stories (most episodes had two stories slotted in its 22-minute time slot).\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Teamo Supremo===\n* Captain Crandall / Cap (voiced by [[Spencer Breslin]]) \u2013 The leader of Teamo Supremo, who believes that he is an alien superhero from another planet. He is often addressed as \"Cap\" by his teammates, and his battle catchphrase is \"Buh-Za!\". In later episodes, Crandall's seemingly imaginary superpowers and backstory seem to actually become canon. In the finale, he experiences a sudden burst of superhuman strength and defense. Also, his skin turns purple when he gets very angry. His gadgets include a special Level 7 belt, as well as a [[yo-yo]], marbles, a [[boomerang]], and a shield.\n* Hector Felip\u00e9 Corrio / Skate Lad (voiced by [[Alanna Ubach]]) \u2013 The Hispanic member of Teamo Supremo, Hector is the state's skateboarding champion. His main gadget is a patriotic-themed jet-propelled [[skateboard]] and his catchphrase is \"Chi-Ka!\".\n* Brenda / Rope Girl (voiced by Alanna Ubach) \u2013 The sole female member of Teamo Supremo, she has purple hair and [[buck teeth]] and speaks with a Southern [[drawl]]. Her catchphrase is \"Wuh-Pa!\", and her gadget is a [[jumprope]], which she uses as a [[lasso]] when battling villains, but can also be used to transform herself, Crandall, and Hector into their heroic [[alter ego]]s when all three jump rope together.\n\n===Allies===\n* Governor Kevin (voiced by [[Martin Mull]]) \u2013 The \"groovy\" governor of the state they live in. He always calls for Teamo when necessary, and he sometimes has to lend excuse notes if the crime makes Teamo late for class.\n* The Chief (voiced by [[Brian Doyle-Murray]]) \u2013 The [[chief of police]], who does not take kindly to Teamo taking police matters into their own hands. He was a former US [[Cold War]] [[spy]]. He usually ridicules is when a villain as he captures them using a witty line that ends with jail, prison, etc. (e.g.: \"Come on, space fakes. You're about to take one small step...TO JAIL!!!\"). He once tried to operate as a costumed superhero himself, using the code-name 'Lawman', but made a hash of it since his 'gadgets' consisted of an umbrella and an eggwhisk. He also suffers from Beat Deafness.\n* Mrs. Crandall (voiced by [[Julia Sweeney]]) \u2013 Crandall's human mother. He refers to her as \"Earth Mom\" since he thinks he is an alien. She is completely oblivious to the fact that Crandall and his friends are superheroes (or so it may seem).\n* Jean Crandall (voiced by Rachel Crane) \u2013 Crandall's older human sister who is aware of his superhero career. She often gives the team advice, claiming it's necessary if she \"wants to be a [career] some day\".\n* Mr. Paulson (voiced by [[Fred Willard]]) \u2013 The eccentric director of Level 7, a top-secret facility that makes Teamo's gadgets.\n* Samantha (voiced by [[Kim Gillingham]]) \u2013 Paulson's assistant.\n* Mrs. Woolingantz (voiced by Sydney Walsh) \u2013 Teamo's schoolteacher who often excuses them if Governor Kevin needs them. She doesn't assign much homework, but gets angry when it isn't done.\n* Action (vocal effects provided by [[Frank Welker]]) \u2013 Crandall's dog. He is sometimes called to help Teamo in certain missions, ala Ace the Bat-Hound.\n* Mrs. Corrio \u2013 Hector's mother.\n* The Twins \u2013 Hector's unnamed twin sisters, who often speak gibberish in unison.\n* Brenda's Mom \u2013 Brenda's mother, from whom she seems to get her Southern accent.\n* Barclae / Diaper Dude \u2013 Brenda's baby brother, who once helped Teamo in one of their adventures. His first spoken word was \"Brenda.\"\n* Teamo's Dads \u2013 The kids' respective fathers, but not much is known about them as they've only been seen in one episode. Crandall's dad seems to read the newspaper a lot and Hector's dad runs a skateboard shop.\n* Patience (voiced by Vene L. Arcoraci) \u2013 The Chief's daughter. She has her mother's figure and her father's vocal cords.\n* Mauricio the Comedian (voiced by [[Phil Morris (actor)|Phil Morris]]) \u2013 A black comedian. He has at least twice been the target of villains seeking revenge on him.\n* Tiffany Javelins / Songstress / Sally Smith \u2013 A teen singer whom Brenda idolizes. Originally worked for the Mischievous Manager, but turned good afterwards. Strangely, Toon Disney's official site for the show still labelled her as a villain.\n* B. Barry Berylium \u2013 Chief editor of the state's newspaper, The Stately Planet. He prefers being addressed as \"Chief\" over \"Sir\".\n* Ollie Jimson (voiced by [[Jason Marsden]]) \u2013 A rookie news journalist who works for Mr. Berylium, who finds it annoying that Ollie never calls him \"Chief\". His name is a nod to [[Jimmy Olsen]].\n* Viva Voom \u2013 Governor Kevin's Dutch girlfriend from high school. She is now a famous actress, but still has her relationship with Kevin.\n* A fellow member of the school faculty is usually the one to tell Mrs. Woolingantz that Governor Kevin needs Teamo's help. Her name was never revealed in the series, nor did she ever actually have dialogue (she always whispers to the teacher).\n* Newscaster (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) - The state's newsman who always pops up on TV to deliver news. His name was never revealed either.\n\n===Superheroes===\nThere are other superheroes that help keep the state safe from crime:\n\n* Mr. Gruff (voiced by [[Clancy Brown]] impersonating [[Mr. T]]) - An action hero who Teamo Supremo idolizes.\n* The Silver Shield / Gordon (voiced by [[Robert Stack]]) \u2013 Crandall's grandfather who has had a [[Captain America]]-like superhero identity.

She has since then sworn to give bad hair to everyone and display it to the world.\n* The Gauntlet ([[Wallace Shawn]]) \u2013 Crawford is formerly one of Paulson's co-workers obsessed with power.

Billy Jim Dixon is a former host of the TV show \"Fishin' with Billy Jim Dixon\" until the show was cancelled and his fishing license revoked due to his henchmen being secretly behind his expert fishing skills that also involved hooking store-bought fish to his line.

His real name is William Aloysius Wynn, but when Governor Kevin beat him in the election for high school class president (which according to Kevin, was the only time Wynn lost at anything), Wynn changed his name to Will 2 Wynn. Will seemed certain to win the election due to his massive campaign fund, which came from a group known as \"Will's Friends\". After doing some investigating in the archives, Teamo discovered that the group consisted of many of their archenemies, which caused Will to reveal his true motive. Will planned to get back at Governor Kevin for beating him, by helping every villain in the state get back at Teamo. However, Will was beaten and his criminal dealings were exposed, causing him to lose the election as it is illegal to accept campaign donations from criminals, and state law prohibits the election of anyone in jail.\n* Mr. Alchemy (voiced by [[Xander Berkeley]]) - An alchemy-themed supervillain who wields an alchemy wand. He once stole Mr. Gruff's voice in order to ruin everyone's holiday season since he thought that Christmas was for people getting new things.

Enraged by this, he changed his name to DJ Despicable and he and his henchmen, The Mikes, used a special music to hypnotize people into doing an unstoppable dance while he's on his crime spree. He was defeated by the Chief as the latter's Beat Deafness rendered him immune to D.J.'s hypnotic music.\n* Barney the Bungler - A clumsy low-level villain.\n* Comrade Z - A villain who is an old enemy of the Silver Shield.\n* General Incompetence and Major Delays - Two inept ex-militarists.\n* Libro Shushman - A librarian who turned to a life of crime.\n* Dr. Minutia - \n* Lo Fi (voiced by [[Michael McKean]]) \u2013 A famous musician who turned to a life of crime after the public rejected his experimental use of low frequency music, which he now uses in his crimes.\n* Lavalizer \u2013 A minor villain with control of fire.\n* Mean Thumb \u2013 A villain with very large thumbs.\n\n==Episodes==\nMost of the episodes in the final two seasons did not air in production code order.\n{{Series overview\n|color1=224C6E\n|color2=740C8E\n|color3=ffd700\n|end1={{End date|2002|5|25}}\n|end2A={{End date|2003|5|31}}\n|end2B={{Start date|2003|8|8}}\n|end3={{End date|2004|8|17}}\n|episodes1=26\n|episodes2=37\n|episodes2A=15\n|episodes2B=22\n|episodes3=13\n|link1=#Season 1 (2002)\n|link2=#Season 2 (2002\u201303)\n|link3=#Season 3 (2003\u201304)\n|network1=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|network2B=[[Toon Disney]]\n|start1={{Start date|2002|1|19}}\n|start2A={{Start date|2002|9|14}}\n|start2B={{Start date|2002|8|25}}\n|start3={{Start date|2003|12|5}}\n}}\n===Season 1 (2002)===\nThe first season consisted of 26 episodes and aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].\n{{Episode table|background=224C6E|overall=|season=|title=|writer=|airdate=|prodcode=|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| Title           = In the Beginning...\n| WrittenBy       = Phil Walsh\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2002|1|19}}\n| ShortSummary    = Crandall gets together a team of superheroes (Himself, Brenda, and Hector.)

its style, it tells of three superhero children: Captain Crandall, Skate Lad, and Rope Girl. These three protect their state from supervillains including evil Baron Blitz, and the shape-changing [[femme fatale]] known as Madame Snake.\n\nThe series debuted on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] as part of [[ABC Kids (United States)|Disney's One Saturday Morning]] block on January 19, 2002, where most of its first season aired. However, it started regularly airing on [[Toon Disney]] in September of that same year, where most of its second season premiered. During the spring of 2003, about half of its second season premiered on what had been by then renamed ABC Kids. In September 2003, it was taken off ABC Kids, leaving the rest of the episodes to premiere on Toon Disney, ending its run by 2004. Thirty-nine episodes were made, with 76 total stories (most episodes had two stories slotted in its 22-minute time slot).\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Teamo Supremo===\n* Captain Crandall / Cap (voiced by [[Spencer Breslin]]) \u2013 The leader of Teamo Supremo, who believes that he is an alien superhero from another planet. He is often addressed as \"Cap\" by his teammates, and his battle catchphrase is \"Buh-Za!\". In later episodes, Crandall's seemingly imaginary superpowers and backstory seem to actually become canon. In the finale, he experiences a sudden burst of superhuman strength and defense. Also, his skin turns purple when he gets very angry. His gadgets include a special Level 7 belt, as well as a [[yo-yo]], marbles, a [[boomerang]], and a shield.\n* Hector Felip\u00e9 Corrio / Skate Lad (voiced by [[Alanna Ubach]]) \u2013 The Hispanic member of Teamo Supremo, Hector is the state's skateboarding champion. His main gadget is a patriotic-themed jet-propelled [[skateboard]] and his catchphrase is \"Chi-Ka!\".\n* Brenda / Rope Girl (voiced by Alanna Ubach) \u2013 The sole female member of Teamo Supremo, she has purple hair and [[buck teeth]] and speaks with a Southern [[drawl]]. Her catchphrase is \"Wuh-Pa!\", and her gadget is a [[jumprope]], which she uses as a [[lasso]] when battling villains, but can also be used to transform herself, Crandall, and Hector into their heroic [[alter ego]]s when all three jump rope together.\n\n===Allies===\n* Governor Kevin (voiced by [[Martin Mull]]) \u2013 The \"groovy\" governor of the state they live in. He always calls for Teamo when necessary, and he sometimes has to lend excuse notes if the crime makes Teamo late for class.\n* The Chief (voiced by [[Brian Doyle-Murray]]) \u2013 The [[chief of police]], who does not take kindly to Teamo taking police matters into their own hands. He was a former US [[Cold War]] [[spy]]. He usually ridicules is when a villain as he captures them using a witty line that ends with jail, prison, etc. (e.g.: \"Come on, space fakes. You're about to take one small step...TO JAIL!!!\"). He once tried to operate as a costumed superhero himself, using the code-name 'Lawman', but made a hash of it since his 'gadgets' consisted of an umbrella and an eggwhisk. He also suffers from Beat Deafness.\n* Mrs. Crandall (voiced by [[Julia Sweeney]]) \u2013 Crandall's human mother. He refers to her as \"Earth Mom\" since he thinks he is an alien. She is completely oblivious to the fact that Crandall and his friends are superheroes (or so it may seem).\n* Jean Crandall (voiced by Rachel Crane) \u2013 Crandall's older human sister who is aware of his superhero career. She often gives the team advice, claiming it's necessary if she \"wants to be a [career] some day\".\n* Mr. Paulson (voiced by [[Fred Willard]]) \u2013 The eccentric director of Level 7, a top-secret facility that makes Teamo's gadgets.\n* Samantha (voiced by [[Kim Gillingham]]) \u2013 Paulson's assistant.\n* Mrs. Woolingantz (voiced by Sydney Walsh) \u2013 Teamo's schoolteacher who often excuses them if Governor Kevin needs them. She doesn't assign much homework, but gets angry when it isn't done.\n* Action (vocal effects provided by [[Frank Welker]]) \u2013 Crandall's dog. He is sometimes called to help Teamo in certain missions, ala Ace the Bat-Hound.\n* Mrs. Corrio \u2013 Hector's mother.\n* The Twins \u2013 Hector's unnamed twin sisters, who often speak gibberish in unison.\n* Brenda's Mom \u2013 Brenda's mother, from whom she seems to get her Southern accent.\n* Barclae / Diaper Dude \u2013 Brenda's baby brother, who once helped Teamo in one of their adventures. His first spoken word was \"Brenda.\"\n* Teamo's Dads \u2013 The kids' respective fathers, but not much is known about them as they've only been seen in one episode. Crandall's dad seems to read the newspaper a lot and Hector's dad runs a skateboard shop.\n* Patience (voiced by Vene L. Arcoraci) \u2013 The Chief's daughter. She has her mother's figure and her father's vocal cords.\n* Mauricio the Comedian (voiced by [[Phil Morris (actor)|Phil Morris]]) \u2013 A black comedian. He has at least twice been the target of villains seeking revenge on him.\n* Tiffany Javelins / Songstress / Sally Smith \u2013 A teen singer whom Brenda idolizes. Originally worked for the Mischievous Manager, but turned good afterwards. Strangely, Toon Disney's official site for the show still labelled her as a villain.\n* B. Barry Berylium \u2013 Chief editor of the state's newspaper, The Stately Planet. He prefers being addressed as \"Chief\" over \"Sir\".\n* Ollie Jimson (voiced by [[Jason Marsden]]) \u2013 A rookie news journalist who works for Mr. Berylium, who finds it annoying that Ollie never calls him \"Chief\". His name is a nod to [[Jimmy Olsen]].\n* Viva Voom \u2013 Governor Kevin's Dutch girlfriend from high school. She is now a famous actress, but still has her relationship with Kevin.\n* A fellow member of the school faculty is usually the one to tell Mrs. Woolingantz that Governor Kevin needs Teamo's help. Her name was never revealed in the series, nor did she ever actually have dialogue (she always whispers to the teacher).\n* Newscaster (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) - The state's newsman who always pops up on TV to deliver news. His name was never revealed either.\n\n===Superheroes===\nThere are other superheroes that help keep the state safe from crime:\n\n* Mr. Gruff (voiced by [[Clancy Brown]] impersonating [[Mr. T]]) - An action hero who Teamo Supremo idolizes.\n* The Silver Shield / Gordon (voiced by [[Robert Stack]]) \u2013 Crandall's grandfather who has had a [[Captain America]]-like superhero identity. His battle cry is \"Let freedom ring.\"\n* The Dark Talon / Nick (voiced by [[Gary Owens]]) \u2013 Crandall's other grandfather who has had a [[Batman]]-like superhero identity.\n* Captain Excellent (voiced by [[John O'Hurley]]) \u2013 An old superhero whom Crandall idolizes.\n\n===Villains===\n* Baron Blitz (voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]] in a German accent) \u2013 A short blue man, possibly from an alien world himself. He is known for taking control of wax statues, and later on bronze statues and animatronics. Baron Blitz is from Blitzlevania.\n* Technor the Mechanized Man (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 Originally invented by Paulson to be a robot psychologist; now power-hungry. He often travels in his power-sucking Magna Body. A spoof of [[Marvel Comics]] villain [[MODOK]]].\n** Techno-Creeps - The henchmen of Technor. Their outfits are similar to the [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] Agents.\n* Chopper Daddy ([[Jess Harnell]]) \u2013 A motorcycle-themed villain.\n** Scooter Lad a.k.a. Snake a.k.a. Justin (voiced by [[Pamela Adlon]]) \u2013 Chopper Daddy's son, who rides a scooter. He has twice tricked Teamo into believing they could trust him and his battle catchphrase is \"Hoo-Ka!\"\n* The Birthday Bandit (voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]) \u2013 B.B. the Clown is a birthday clown gone bad who often robs birthday parties and other special occasions. He briefly changed his name to the Valentine Bandit when he kidnapped Viva Voom.\n** Party Favors - Similarly-dressed henchmen of Birthday Bandit. One Party Favor is named Evelyn.\n* Madame Snake (voiced by [[Sydney Walsh]]) \u2013 A femme fatale with snake-like features the ability to change her appearance, as well as an outrageously bad fashion sense.\n** Toy Boys - Madame Snake's henchmen.\n* Mr. Large (voiced by [[Ed Asner|Edward Asner]]) \u2013 A stereotypical mob leader who likes large items.\n** Ernie the Hat (voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]) - One of Mr. Large's henchmen who wears a fedora.\n** Mickey the Shirt (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) - One of Mr. Large's henchmen who wears a tropical shirt.\n** Rosie the Purse (voiced by [[Sydney Walsh]]) - One of Mr. Large's henchmen who is always carrying a purse.\n* Helius Inflato (voiced by [[Joel Murray]]) \u2013 A guy who can inflate himself and fly, hence his name. He wants to build a casino in the state, but isn't allowed to.\n* Cheapskate (voiced by [[John Kassir]]) \u2013 A skateboarding villain who tried to frame Hector for all his crimes.\n* Laser Pirate (voiced by [[Tim Curry]] in most appearances, [[Jeff Bennett]] in \"In the Beginning...\") \u2013 Larry is a former colleague of Paulson. He is the only pirate that doesn't like water due to a college incident that ruined his invention. His hideout is a skyscraper that flies around (a possible homage to ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]'').\n** Mauve-Beard - One of Laser Pirate's henchmen.\n** Chartruese-Beard - One of Laser Pirate's henchmen.\n** Indigo-Beard - One of Laser Pirate's henchmen.\n* Hypnotheria (voiced by [[April Winchell]]) \u2013 A hypnosis-themed villain who thinks of herself as royalty and speaks of herself in the 2nd person.\n* The Sinister Stylist (voiced by Sydney Walsh) \u2013 Coco Caliente is an ex-soap opera actress who had a bad hair day and ended up humiliated by TV funnyman [[Maurico]], due to the almost constant laughter of the audience attending that year's state awards show. She has since then sworn to give bad hair to everyone and display it to the world.\n* The Gauntlet ([[Wallace Shawn]]) \u2013 Crawford is formerly one of Paulson's co-workers obsessed with power. He continually wreaks havoc with a pair of powerful Gauntlets he's always able to steal.\n* Fabrica (voiced by [[Nicole Sullivan]]) \u2013 A stuffed toy maker who used them to commit crimes. She once brought to life all the stuffed toys in the state including Teamo Supremo's stuffed toys.\n* Dehydro (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]) \u2013 A water-themed baddie. He has a habit of repeating himself, and repeating himself is what he does. Dehydro over-reiterates, and says things too many times.\n* The Mischievous Manager \u2013 She appeared as the manager of The Songstress where she used her to control all the girls in the state with Songstress' songs. Teamo Supreme managed to defeat the Mischievous Manager who is then arrested by the Chief.

The series takes place in the fictional city of Petropolis (distinct from the Brazilian city of [[Petr\u00f3polis]], which is named after [[Pedro II of Brazil]]), which is populated by [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals. As a member of T.U.F.F., Dudley Puppy helps Kitty Katswell protect Petropolis from various villains like Verminious Snaptrap, the Chameleon, and Birdbrain.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of T.U.F.F. Puppy episodes}}\n{{:List of T.U.F.F. Puppy episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n{{Very long section|date=October 2018}}\n\n=== Main ===\n\n==== T.U.F.F. ====\nThe Turbo Undercover Fighting Force (T.U.F.F.) is an organization that protects Petropolis from crime.\n\n* Dudley Puppy (voiced by [[Jerry Trainor]]) \u2013 He is the heart and soul of T.U.F.F. even though he's depicted as an idiotic, airheaded, hyperactive and loud white and black, [[mixed-breed dog]] who usually wears nothing more than a black T-shirt. Despite his lack of common sense he has been proven to be exceedingly clever (i.e. tricking the Chameleon into morphing into a mouse so that Agent Jumbo would jump on him out of fear). Dudley was first discovered by T.U.F.F. when he followed his recently acquired chew toy into D.O.O.M.'s headquarters where he unknowingly defeated Francisco, Bad Dog, and Leather Teddy at the time when Kitty Katswell was pursuing Verminious Snaptrap. Keswick's DNA analysis shows that Dudley is the \"perfect mix of every breed of dog known to man\". Since each breed of dog has a special trait (like a [[beagle]]'s appearance, a [[Bloodhound]]'s sensitive nose, a [[Greyhound]]'s speed, [[German Shepherd]]'s brave heart, the fighting abilities of a Chinese Fighting Dog ([[Shar-Pei]])  the buff chest and arms of an [[Alaskan Malamute]], the French-speaking of a [[Poodle|French Poodle]], the leaping abilities of a [[English Springer Spaniel|Springer]]. etc.), Dudley's overall natural skills makes him a formidable agent and he is made Kitty Katswell's partner. Dudley also has bad habits of being gluttonous and immature. Despite this eccentric personality, his bravery and advanced natural physical skills are an asset to T.U.F.F. in times of need and he can be pretty sensible when needed. He usually comes up with clever plans to stop his enemies, and he becomes more and more noble as time goes by. His catchphrase is \"Hi gee gee\", and he often says it whenever he's ready to jet out of the area. A running gag consists of the fact he reads poorly and cannot spell or write. However, there have been many times that Dudley has demonstrated that he has these abilities. In the episode \"Snap Dad\", it's revealed that Dudley's mother is still dating; the whereabouts of Dudley's father have not been revealed.\n* Kitty Katswell (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 A female [[cat]] who is one of T.U.F.F.'s best agents. She is also Dudley's partner and best friend. Skilled in various fighting styles and use of firearms, is short tempered, and easily startled, Kitty Katswell is a force to be reckoned with. A few episodes mention that her birthdays as a child have been horrendous, she spent eight years in Secret Agent College, and has a twin sister named Katty who is in jail. Being a cat, she naturally fought with Dudley (who is a dog) when he first joined the agency (usually in an immature manner). However, as episodes progress, she becomes more affectionate to Dudley as he presents his courage, skill, nobility, and respect for her and T.U.F.F. more often. Later they stop fighting and become heartfelt friends. She wears a dark gray spy suit over her white turtle neck, white high heeled boots, a white hairband, and white gloves (unless she is wearing a disguise). She occasionally gives into her animal instincts like chasing mice and birds, clawing things, or leaving dead mice on doorsteps.\n* Chief Herbert Dumbrowski (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]) \u2013 A tough and strict but good-natured [[flea]] Which is Carls Brother Resambles [[Scorpion]] who is the leader of T.U.F.F. Subsequently, he's Dudley's employer and (although he's usually getting angry at Dudley and yelling at him) he seems to be somewhat proud of him as an agent. In \"Internal Affairs\", it's revealed that he used to be T.U.F.F.'s top field agent until he retired and became (or was most-likely awarded) the chief of T.U.F.F. The episode also revealed that he has a bionic foot, has short term memory loss, and uses a [[toup\u00e9e]] (all due to his aging).\n* Keswick (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 The primary [[Invention|inventor]] and [[scientist]] of T.U.F.F. HQ, although whatever he invents is somewhat worthless due to the fact that it shoots acid, is too dangerous, or is just downright unpredictable. Many of his ray guns have weird results, to which he responds with frustration towards himself. Usually, when he speaks, he has a [[Stuttering|stutter]]. Dudley is somewhat close to him although Dudley finds him and his random abilities odd, making him curious about his species. Oddly enough, Keswick's species is simply \"Keswick\". Subsequently, it's shown that he has [[gills]], [[webbed feet]], looks like a [[labradoodle]] or a [[prairie dog]], and has the ability to lay eggs. In \"Pup Daddy\", it's shown that he goes through animal phases. In \"The Doomies\", it's shown that he's not on good terms with his parents and in \"Dog Dish\", it's revealed that he has a brother-in-law named Stan. This confirms he has a sister. In \"Love Bird\", it is known that his mom didn't like him dating because relationships are a lot of work and that the girl will lose her girlish figure. In \"Crusin' for a Brusin'\", it is shown that he cannot sing well because of his stuttering. It is also revealed in \"Thunder Dog\" that he is exceedingly afraid of girls. In \"True Spies\", it is revealed that Keswick is an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] from Keswickia who is wanted by the Keswickian Police for cooking stinky fish at work, as his planet is very strict.\n* T.U.F.F. Troopers \u2013 The foot soldiers of T.U.F.F. who resemble older versions of Dudley.\n\nAlso in T.U.F.F. are various personnel that appear as background characters whether as agents, office workers, and/or scientists. Some of the minor members of T.U.F.F. that have been identified or mentioned include:\n\n* Agent [[Amoeba]] \u2013 A microscopic T.U.F.F. Agent who the Chief mentioned to have helped him start Spackle and Grout Day in \"Lie Like a Dog\".\n* Agent [[Ant]] \u2013 An ant T.U.F.F. Agent who was incorrectly paired with Agent Anteater in \"Match Me If You Can\".\n* Agent [[Anteater]] \u2013 An anteater T.U.F.F. Agent who was incorrectly paired with Agent Ant in \"Match Me If You Can\".\n* Agent Bacon \u2013 A [[pig]] T.U.F.F. Agent that is seen in \"Super Duper Crime Busters\". It is implied that he has a hobby of knitting.\n* Agent [[Big Bad Wolf]] \u2013 A [[Gray wolf|wolf]] T.U.F.F. agent who was incorrectly paired with Agent Three Little Pigs in \"Match Me If You Can\".\n* Agent Bossy (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 A [[Cattle|cow]] T.U.F.F. Agent that is seen in \"Mall Rat\" and \"The Wrong Stuff\". She tends to surf the internet to find meat that would be insensitive to her.\n* Agent [[Chicago Bulls|Bull]] \u2013 A [[cattle]] T.U.F.F. Agent that is seen in \"Happy Howl-O-Ween\". He is based on the stereotype that bulls get angry when they see the color red.\n* Agent [[Goldfish]] (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 A T.U.F.F. Agent who only appeared in \"Thunder Dog\" so far. She has a fear of toilets.\n* Agent [[Groundhog]] (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 A T.U.F.F. Agent who first made a cameo in \"Hot Dog\". He resides under an office printer and is the one who tells about the end of winter.\n* Agent [[Guinea pig|Guinea Pig]] \u2013 A T.U.F.F. Agent who only appeared in \"Candy Cane-Ine\" so far. He was seen running on a hamster wheel.\n* Agent Hammerhead \u2013 A [[hammerhead shark]] T.U.F.F. Agent who was first seen in \"Puppy Unplugged\".\n* Agent Jumbo (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 An [[elephant]] T.U.F.F. Agent who has a fear of mice which would result in her jumping up when she sees them and accidentally crushing anyone.\n* Agent Kid \u2013 A [[goat]] T.U.F.F. Agent who was first seen in \"Pup Daddy\". He is known to eat cans including the ones that are in the recycling bin.\n* Agent Moby (voiced by [[Matthew W. Taylor]]) \u2013 A [[whale]] T.U.F.F. Agent who appeared in \"A Doomed Christmas\". Like Agent Jumbo, Agent Moby also has a tendency to accidentally crush the Chief.\n* Agent [[Mouse]] \u2013 A mouse T.U.F.F. Agent who was incorrectly paired with Agent Snake in \"Match Me If You Can\" where he was swallowed whole by Agent Snake.\n* Agent Nutz (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 A [[squirrel]] T.U.F.F. Agent who would always freak out about something completely random and blast it with his laser.\n* Agent [[Scarecrow]] \u2013 A T.U.F.F. Agent that is not based on any animal. So far, he has only been seen in \"Mom-A-Geddon\".\n* Agent Seabiscuit (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 A [[horse]] T.U.F.F. Agent who first appeared in \"The Dog Who Cried Fish\". He is shown to be offended when somebody claimed that they can \"eat like a horse\".\n* Agent [[Sea cucumber|Sea Cucumber]] \u2013 A T.U.F.F. Agent that appeared in \"Acting T.U.F.F\".\n* Agent [[Skunk]] \u2013 A T.U.F.F. Agent that appeared in \"T.U.F.F. Choices\" where he is adverse to being waken up.\n* Agent [[Snake]] \u2013 A snake T.U.F.F. Agent who was incorrectly paired with Agent Mouse in \"Match Me If You Can\" where he ended up swallowing Agent Mouse whole.\n* Agent [[Three Little Pigs]] \u2013 Three pig T.U.F.F. Agents who were incorrectly paired with Agent Big Bad Wolf in \"Match Me If You Can\".\n* George Looney \u2013 A [[loon]] that works as a [[janitor]] at T.U.F.F. and is a descendant of Petropolis' founder Daniel Boone Looney. George Looney has so far been only seen in \"Legal Beagle\".\n* Sally Mander (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 A [[salamander]] that works as a [[secretary]] at T.U.F.F. Her name is a pun on \"salamander\".\n* Scary Jimmy  (voiced by [[Matthew W. Taylor]]) \u2013 A bull that works as a [[janitor]] at T.U.F.F. He is a very suspicious and strange person. Scary Jimmy is implied to be somewhat of a shut-in, mentally unstable, paranoid and potentially harmful. He has stated that he can memorize the backs of people's heads.\n* Tammy (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 A rabbit that works as a [[secretary]] at T.U.F.F.\n\n====Main villains====\n* Verminous Snaptrap (voiced by [[Matthew W. Taylor]]) \u2013 A [[rat]] who is the leader of the Diabolical Order of Mayhem. Despite being a rat, he is allergic to cheese which causes him to swell up. Like his nemesis Dudley Puppy, he is hyperactive, immature, and airheaded. However, unlike Dudley, he doesn't show intellectual potential. He is often easily frustrated when his fellow D.O.O.M. members do something foolish. A running gag is Snaptrap throwing Larry, Dudley, Kitty, or others into his shark tank (which never actually kills any of them). In \"Operation: Happy Birthday\", it's revealed that he still lives with his mother. Later on in \"Dog Dish\", it's revealed that his mother buys all of Snaptrap's evil gadgets. That same episode shows that he has a blog, and that he uses his gadgets for incredibly stupid plans such as sneaking into movie theaters. Although, on some occasions, he has shown to be able to do true evil, such as launching the entire town into the sun (as seen in \"Mall Rat\" when he faked his reform). After most defeats, he shouts \"I will now plot my revenge!\" In \"Forget Me Mutt\", it's shown that he's verbally abused by his mother. In \"Mind Trap\", he's shown to go dumpster diving for food.\n* The [[Chameleon]] (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]) \u2013 A [[chameleon]] in a molecular transformation suit which allows him to shapeshift into virtually any disguise or inanimate object. In \"Doom-mates\", his name is pronounced \"The Cham-a-leon\" as a running gag he wanted to get revenge on Kitty Katswell by blowing her up nine times but Dudley heroically thwarted his evil plan, thus saving her. He talks like Peter Lorre and eats any bug he sees, a trait used against him several times. His relationship with D.O.O.M. seems rather strained, since he tends to work separately from the others and once planned to trick them and T.U.F.F. to destroy each other. He said he wanted to go to D.O.O.M.'s weekly ice cream socials, but he was never invited. The Chameleon later teamed up with D.O.O.M. in \"Mission: Really Big Mission,\" ending with him being blasted into space (which he somehow survived). As a running gag, he often tries to wear some type of eyewear only to have his eyes go around or through them, as his chameleon eyes constantly bug around and look in separate directions, which creeps Dudley out, as seen in \"Doom-Mates.\" He can sometimes be very random when disguised. Whenever he's in disguise, he tends to say random things relating to his disguise (For example, in \"Internal Affairs,\" disguised as General Warhog tells the soldiers \"semper fi\" and \"remember the Alamo\"). Oddly, whenever the story has him using a disguise for a long time as a major plot point, his voice is never disguised, despite him being able to disguise it during the short disguises in other episodes (although this may be because he experiences a sort of discomfort by mimicking voices, forcing him to do it rarely, but this is just speculation, and it has yet to be explained). Another oddity is that Dudley can never tell when the Chameleon is disguised or what he is disguised as, despite him having the sharp nose of a bloodhound (possibly the Chameleon can disguise his smell, too). If the Chameleon is splashed with liquid while in disguise, his suit will short circuit and he will be forced to return to normal (although he notes that it's only on the outside, as inside, it makes him feel bloated). Also, his suit is wired into his brain and if it's removed, he will have no choice but return to his normal form.\n* Bird Brain (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) \u2013 Bird Brain is an evil [[Blue-footed booby|blue-bottomed booby]] Resambles [[flamingo]] genius who can't fly with his wings (something he always forgets). Despite his species name's origin which is from the Spanish word \"bobo\" or \"stupid\", he is more intelligent and competent than both Snaptrap and the Chameleon. Bird Brain seems to be quite intelligent and capable at his job. Like Snaptrap, he is very easily frustrated by his comrades, whom tend to be genuinely much more foolish than Snaptrap's smarter and more villainous gang. In \"Thunder Dog\" it is revealed that he is prematurely bald. In \"A Doomed Christmas\", it is revealed that although he looks old he is only 23. In \"Hush Puppy\", it is revealed that he lost his hair at a young age due to stress.\n\n=====Snaptrap's Henchmen or D.O.O.M.=====\n\n* Larry (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 A [[shrew]] who is Verminious Snaptrap's brother-in-law (Larry's married to Snaptrap's sister) and one of his three main henchmen. Despite being considered dim-witted by Snaptrap, Larry is the second smartest and most intelligent of his three main henchmen. Larry often infuriates Snaptrap by talking back to him or, on a few occasions, making mistakes, which results in him either getting blasted by a laser or thrown into the shark tank. In \"Doom and Gloom\", the recent abuse from Snaptrap and him not listening to Larry's advice not to tell T.U.F.F. of his plans causes Larry to splinter off from Snaptrap and forms G.L.O.O.M. (short for Genius Larry's Order of Mayhem) with Ollie and Francisco where Larry operated under the alias of Murray. While planning a plot to turn off Petropolis' power and cover the whole city in fog emitted from a fog machine, Larry had G.L.O.O.M's temporary headquarters in the sewing room owned by Snaptrap's mom. With help from Snaptrap, Dudley and Kitty were able to stop Larry's plot and get Larry, Ollie, and Francisco back onto D.O.O.M. In \"True Spies\", it is revealed that Snaptrap actually doesn't hate Larry, but only mistreated him because he believes he has much potential to be malignant.\n* Ollie (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 A sensible and smart British [[opossum]] who is one of Snaptrap's main henchmen. Ollie is Snaptrap's voice of reason whom he often ignores. A recurring gag in the series is that Ollie is the one who accidentally gives Snaptrap something cheese related either forgetting about his boss's cheese allergy or Snaptrap idiotically forgetting it himself. Another gag involving him is that Ollie is the one who gives Snaptrap the ideas for his evil plans due to a misunderstanding that Snaptrap has already come up with a plan only to reveal it's just something he likes to do (i.e. in \"Iron Mutt\", he thinks that Snaptrap has planned to trap the principal of the local high school and impersonate her due to the large mousetrap and the dress he's wearing which Snaptrap, who just really liked wearing dresses, quickly covers up by saying that was his plan). In \"True Spies\", it is revealed that Ollie isn't really British, but uses a British accent to make himself sound smart.\n* Francisco (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]) \u2013 An [[alligator]] Resembles [[Lowland Gorilla]] who is one of Snaptrap's three main henchmen. He is also the only one of Snaptrap's henchman who seems to take villainy seriously. In \"Dog Dish\", he kept trying to convince Snaptrap to use the invisibility helmet for more evil deeds than sneaking into the movies. In \"True Spies\", it is revealed that Francisco's real name is Francesca because his parents wanted a girl.\n* Bad Dog (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]] in the first appearance, [[Daran Norris]] in later appearances) \u2013 A [[pit bull]] and one of Snaptrap's henchmen. He is often seen with a black torn sleeveless shirt with a skull on it (similar to [[Punisher]]'s T-shirt). Bad Dog is often paired up with Leather Teddy. He stops appearing after the first season.\n* Leather Teddy (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]) \u2013 A leather clad blue bear and one of Snaptrap's henchmen that wears an eyepatch (though the first episode shows that he still has an eye under the eyepatch). He wields bear traps on chains for weapons. Leather Teddy's outfit gives him the appearance of a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|biker]]. He is often paired up with Bad Dog. He stops appearing after the first season.\n* The [[Mole (animal)|Mole]] (voiced by Matthew W. Taylor) \u2013 A mole agent who is Snaptrap's master of infiltration. He stops appearing after the first season.\n*[[Skunk]] (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 A skunk who is one of Snaptrap's henchmen. So far, he has only appeared in \"Cruisin' with a Bruisin\".\n*Snaptrap is also shown to have other, unnamed minions over the course of the show, but they never have major roles, and eventually stopped appearing.\n\n=====Bird Brain's Henchmen=====\n\n* Zippy (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 Zippy is Bird Brain's scatterbrained [[hummingbird]] sidekick/partner who constantly encourages him to fly, despite the fact that his subspecies is incapable of it (although real-life boobies are able to fly). Whenever Owl and Bat would say \"Who?\" and \"Where?\" respectively, Zippy occasionally adds \"Why?\" which often infuriates Bird Brain.\n*[[Owl]] (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 Owl is one of Bird Brain's henchmen upon being hired by Zippy. He and Bat are both very incompetent where he would often infuriate his boss by saying \"Who?\".\n*[[Bat]] (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]) \u2013 Bat is one of Bird Brain's henchmen upon them being hired by Zippy. He and Owl are both very incompetent where he would infuriate his boss by saying \"Where?\" in response to the orders given to him. Bat is suggested to be blind (although he occasionally does his job exactly as told implying that he has some vision and he is apparently slightly smarter than Owl). Bird Brain seems to like Bat more because at one point in \"Thunder Dog\", Bat did his job exactly as he was told without saying his usual \"Where?\" This surprised Bird Brain while Owl idiotically said his usual \"Who?\", as Bird Brain threatened to hit Owl with a boulder.\n*[[Duck]] (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 A duck who is one of Bird Brain's more recent henchmen as seen in \"Puppy Unplugged\". He can speak in both duck and human languages. Whenever someone says his name, other people \"duck\" for cover because they think that something is coming right at them. In \"Puppy Unplugged\", it is revealed that his real name is \"Skip\", causing everyone to skip around happily.\n* Ewe (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 A female [[sheep]] who is one of Bird Brain's more recent henchmen as seen in \"Monkey Business\".\n*[[Fly]] \u2013 A small purple fly who is one of Bird Brain's henchmen as seen in \"Bad Eggs\" (although he never signed the application, and is in fact just a housefly). When Bird Brain says his name, his henchmen start flying around him.\n* Peck Me \u2013 A [[goose]] who is one of Bird Brain's henchmen in \"Barking Tall\". When Bird Brain says his name, his henchmen start pecking him.\n* Holy Cow (voiced by [[Maddie Taylor|Matthew W. Taylor]]) - A cow who is another one of Bird Brain's henchmen. He was first seen in \"Love Bird\". His first appearance is when Bird Brain said \"Holy cow!\" Holy Cow thinks Bird Brain called him, but Bird Brain said \"Not you, Holy Cow.\" His second appearance is when Bird Brain calls him again, but Bird Brain says, \"No, get back in the [[minivan]].\" He [[Fourth wall|breaks the fourth wall]] when Bird Brain calls him one more time, but Bird Brain says \"Don't\".)\n\n===Recurring characters===\n====Other villains====\n\n* R.I.T.A. (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 R.I.T.A. is a super-intelligent toaster created by Keswick. She stops Snaptrap and the Chameleon, but when Keswick attempts to unplug her because T.U.F.F. is eco-friendly, R.I.T.A. turned evil and attempted to take over the city. With the help of Keswick's hologram, Dudley makes her to fall to her death on a cliff and into a lake. Some of her lines and actions suggest that she (at least in part) is a parody of the evil computer H.A.L. from ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.\n* Snowflake and Slush (voiced by [[Mary Birdsong]] and [[Dave Boat]]) \u2013 Snowflake and Slush are evil [[rabbit]] siblings who dress up as vegetables and cheat in events by eliminating and kidnapping the winners. Snowflake is the mastermind of the two, while Slush possesses little to no intelligence, who in his sister's words is \"dumber than a box of hair\" (she should know, she used to skate with one, and claims it was smarter than him). Despite his immense stupidity, he is very competent with Snowflake's plan and when it is ruined, he is shown to be just as angry at the failure and desperate to escape as Snowflake is.\n* Dr. Rabies and Madame Catastrophe (voiced by [[Jerry Trainor]] and [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 Two villains who resemble Dudley Puppy and Kitty Katswell except that their evil twins wear eye patches and have goatees on their chins. They only appeared in \"The Doomies\".\n* Mad Cow \u2013 Mad Cow is an angry [[Cattle|bull]] who first appeared in \"Snap Dad\" trying to escape from jail. Mad Cow's escape was a success at the time when Snaptrap was a T.U.F.F. Agent and dating Peg. He tried to escape Petropolis Prison with Snaptrap's help as seen in \"Dog Dish\", but he was stopped by Dudley and Kitty. His name is a reference to \"[[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|mad cow disease]]\".\n* Crazy [[Horse]] \u2013 Crazy Horse is a horse who uses chainsaws (he even whinnies while using chainsaws).

(short for Super Turbo Undercover Fighting Force) and sell their secrets to villains along with the building to earn money. Greedy, clever, arrogant, and dishonest, Jack attempted to lure Kitty into a trap so he could steal her information (mostly to get money from Snaptrap), but was defeated by Dudley and Keswick. Judging by a line from Kitty in \"The Wrong Stuff\", she and Jack were supposedly a couple once. He and Snaptrap are arrested by Dudley and Keswick.

In \"Cold Fish\", the Caped Cod escapes from his incarceration and tried to flood Petropolis again in order to make it part of his kingdom by melting the Riceberg Ice Bird Iceberg.

When it came to stinking up Petropolis with a combined odor of the stuff he stole, Percival gave away the name of the Stink Bug's device causing Stink Bug to fire him and send him down the trap door.

Dudley, Chief, and Keswick all watch Quacky's show, but Dudley is his biggest fan and the captain of his unofficial fan club. When his show was cancelled, Quacky wanted to get revenge by blasting the TV Chairman with a nuclear missile with Dudley and Kitty tied to it. He was arrested by Dudley and his show is now in prison where he has Revenge Rabbit show viewers how to get revenge on the jury that convicts anyone. In \"Lucky Duck\", Quacky the Duck is released from prison and establishes a restaurant. In \"Quack in the Box\", he and Sharing Moose are released from prison and start a fast food chain. They try to get revenge on Dudley by framing him for taking out the competition against other fast food chains using action figures of characters from Quacky's show. However, his plan was discovered and he was stopped once again. He later appeared again in \"Lights, Camera, Quacktion\" when it was revealed that he lost his TV show and seek revenge on T.U.F.F. by framing Dudley, Kitty, Keswick and the Chief into thinking that he was going to make a movie and having them commit serious crimes such as stealing a truck, steal gold from [[Fort Knox|Fort Ox]], and loading them into a ship to Canada. His plan almost worked, but was foiled by T.U.F.F. Quacky makes another appearance in \"Quacky Birthday\", where he wants to shut T.U.F.F. down once and for all. He pretends he has a party room for Dudley's birthday party. Because of that, Dudley lets him and the Sharing Moose to take things from stores without arresting them. Once the T.U.F.F. agents are in his \"party place\", Quacky locks them in with dynamites. However, Dudley manages to save T.U.F.F. and arrest him. In \"T.U.F.F. Cookies\", Quacky the Duck hires Dudley to help promote his Animal Quackers. He was thwarted again by Dudley.

Katty does this by swapping places with her own sister to steal 24 carat Golden Fishbowl from the Petropolis Art Museum exhibit in which Dudley and Kitty have assignments to protect this. Dudley didn't know that where his partner was swapped by Katty. Katty was eventually found out, ends up defeated by Dudley and Kitty, and is sent back to prison.\n* The [[Weasel]] (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 The Weasel is a super diabolical villain. He targeted Dudley Puppy (who had placed him in prison) and Verminious Snaptrap (who once impersonated him) prompting Kitty Katswell to pose as their mother at Chief's version of a safe house. He did various attempts at Dudley and Snaptrap's lives which even included one where he went straight and gave them a [[jack-in-the-box]] bomb. After that attempt, Dudley and Kitty found the Weasel's house and were able to defeat him. The Weasel was imprisoned and became a cellmate of Snaptrap who was also arrested for looting the Weasel's house.\n* Rumble Bee (voiced by [[Matthew W.

Break Up.\"\n\n====Citizens of Petropolis====\n\n* Peg Puppy (voiced by [[Leslie Carrara-Rudolph]]) \u2013 Peg is Dudley's over-protective mother. She once dated Snaptrap and the Chameleon. In \"Mom-A-Geddon\", she disapproves of Dudley's occupation, but after seeing him in action, allows him to keep his job. She thinks that Kitty is Dudley's secretary, and never gets her name right. She usually bothers Dudley when he's home. In \"Snap Dad\", she's shown to not have her husband after Dudley's father married her which means she's either divorced or widowed.\n* Mrs. Katswell (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 Mrs. Katswell is Kitty's mother who first appeared in a flashback in \"Operation: Happy Birthday\".

She is depicted as being adorably innocent and sweet and her main purpose throughout the episode was to tug at Dudley's shirt after every time Kitty thwarted one of Snaptrap's unusual acts of kindness towards the townspeople and ask why Kitty performed the action that destroyed Snaptrap's most recent contribution. She also made an appearance in \"Bored of Education\" where members T.U.F.F appeared at an elementary school during \"Career Day\" in hopes of influencing the pupils to one day join either side. She appeared as a student at the school who was poorly influenced by the Chameleon (along with all of the other students) to grow up to perform acts of villainy, and she was included to be used for the same gag that had been done in the episode \"Mall Rat\". She is revealed to use her cute looks to make people do what she wants.\n*[[Mayor]] Teddy [[Bear]] (voiced by [[Matthew W. Taylor]]) \u2013 A bear who is the Mayor of Petropolis and had preceded the previously unnamed mayor that was seen in \"Iron Mutt\".

He is a parody of [[Bob Barker]].\n* Phil (voiced by [[Matthew W. Taylor]]) \u2013 Phil is a bulldog who is Dudley's friend. He is never shown, but is described with something gross related to a wart or boil. His first appearance was in \"Lie Like a Dog\" where he is shown to live near the bus station and is implied by Dudley to have wealthy parents. In \"Puppy Unplugged\", Dudley revealed that Phil is married yet his wife hasn't been seen yet.\n* Mr. Wong (voiced by [[Matthew W. Taylor]]) \u2013 A duck who is the owner of \"Wong's Chinese Buffet\". He has a grudge against Dudley for eating ten thousand dollars' worth of food, and keeping his unfinished food in his shirt for later. He was also seen in \"T.U.F.F. Break Up,\" renting out half of T.U.F.F. for his dry-cleaning business.\n\n==Production==\n[[Butch Hartman]] said that he created the central character and wanted to make a crime-fighting show based on him. Because his previous animated series ''[[Danny Phantom]]'' already involved superheroes, Hartman decided that he would focus on making Dudley a secret agent. He pitched the series to [[Nickelodeon]] as \"''[[Get Smart]]'' with a dog.\"<ref name=\"toon\"/>\n\n[[Eric Bauza]], (who voices Foop in ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'' and Leather Teddy in ''T.U.F.F. Puppy'') was originally chosen to be the voice of Dudley Puppy, but the creators didn't feel that he was right for the character and [[Jerry Trainor]] was chosen instead.<ref name=\"toon\">{{cite web|url=https://animesuperhero.com/toonzone-news-interviews-butch-hartman-on-t-u-f-f-puppy//|title=Interview with Butch Hartman|date=29 September 2010|work=Toon Zone|accessdate=29 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe original title of the show was ''Stud Puppy''.<ref>https://twitter.com/realhartman/status/926883234008276992</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n{{Update|section|date=January 2017}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+''T.U.F.F.

Puppy episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n{{Very long section|date=October 2018}}\n\n=== Main ===\n\n==== T.U.F.F. ====\nThe Turbo Undercover Fighting Force (T.U.F.F.) is an organization that protects Petropolis from crime.\n\n* Dudley Puppy (voiced by [[Jerry Trainor]]) \u2013 He is the heart and soul of T.U.F.F. even though he's depicted as an idiotic, airheaded, hyperactive and loud white and black, [[mixed-breed dog]] who usually wears nothing more than a black T-shirt. Despite his lack of common sense he has been proven to be exceedingly clever (i.e. tricking the Chameleon into morphing into a mouse so that Agent Jumbo would jump on him out of fear). Dudley was first discovered by T.U.F.F. when he followed his recently acquired chew toy into D.O.O.M.'s headquarters where he unknowingly defeated Francisco, Bad Dog, and Leather Teddy at the time when Kitty Katswell was pursuing Verminious Snaptrap. Keswick's DNA analysis shows that Dudley is the \"perfect mix of every breed of dog known to man\". Since each breed of dog has a special trait (like a [[beagle]]'s appearance, a [[Bloodhound]]'s sensitive nose, a [[Greyhound]]'s speed, [[German Shepherd]]'s brave heart, the fighting abilities of a Chinese Fighting Dog ([[Shar-Pei]])  the buff chest and arms of an [[Alaskan Malamute]], the French-speaking of a [[Poodle|French Poodle]], the leaping abilities of a [[English Springer Spaniel|Springer]]. etc.), Dudley's overall natural skills makes him a formidable agent and he is made Kitty Katswell's partner. Dudley also has bad habits of being gluttonous and immature. Despite this eccentric personality, his bravery and advanced natural physical skills are an asset to T.U.F.F. in times of need and he can be pretty sensible when needed. He usually comes up with clever plans to stop his enemies, and he becomes more and more noble as time goes by. His catchphrase is \"Hi gee gee\", and he often says it whenever he's ready to jet out of the area. A running gag consists of the fact he reads poorly and cannot spell or write. However, there have been many times that Dudley has demonstrated that he has these abilities. In the episode \"Snap Dad\", it's revealed that Dudley's mother is still dating; the whereabouts of Dudley's father have not been revealed.\n* Kitty Katswell (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 A female [[cat]] who is one of T.U.F.F.'s best agents. She is also Dudley's partner and best friend. Skilled in various fighting styles and use of firearms, is short tempered, and easily startled, Kitty Katswell is a force to be reckoned with. A few episodes mention that her birthdays as a child have been horrendous, she spent eight years in Secret Agent College, and has a twin sister named Katty who is in jail. Being a cat, she naturally fought with Dudley (who is a dog) when he first joined the agency (usually in an immature manner). However, as episodes progress, she becomes more affectionate to Dudley as he presents his courage, skill, nobility, and respect for her and T.U.F.F. more often. Later they stop fighting and become heartfelt friends. She wears a dark gray spy suit over her white turtle neck, white high heeled boots, a white hairband, and white gloves (unless she is wearing a disguise). She occasionally gives into her animal instincts like chasing mice and birds, clawing things, or leaving dead mice on doorsteps.\n* Chief Herbert Dumbrowski (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]) \u2013 A tough and strict but good-natured [[flea]] Which is Carls Brother Resambles [[Scorpion]] who is the leader of T.U.F.F. Subsequently, he's Dudley's employer and (although he's usually getting angry at Dudley and yelling at him) he seems to be somewhat proud of him as an agent. In \"Internal Affairs\", it's revealed that he used to be T.U.F.F.'s top field agent until he retired and became (or was most-likely awarded) the chief of T.U.F.F. The episode also revealed that he has a bionic foot, has short term memory loss, and uses a [[toup\u00e9e]] (all due to his aging).\n* Keswick (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 The primary [[Invention|inventor]] and [[scientist]] of T.U.F.F. HQ, although whatever he invents is somewhat worthless due to the fact that it shoots acid, is too dangerous, or is just downright unpredictable. Many of his ray guns have weird results, to which he responds with frustration towards himself. Usually, when he speaks, he has a [[Stuttering|stutter]]. Dudley is somewhat close to him although Dudley finds him and his random abilities odd, making him curious about his species. Oddly enough, Keswick's species is simply \"Keswick\". Subsequently, it's shown that he has [[gills]], [[webbed feet]], looks like a [[labradoodle]] or a [[prairie dog]], and has the ability to lay eggs. In \"Pup Daddy\", it's shown that he goes through animal phases. In \"The Doomies\", it's shown that he's not on good terms with his parents and in \"Dog Dish\", it's revealed that he has a brother-in-law named Stan. This confirms he has a sister. In \"Love Bird\", it is known that his mom didn't like him dating because relationships are a lot of work and that the girl will lose her girlish figure. In \"Crusin' for a Brusin'\", it is shown that he cannot sing well because of his stuttering. It is also revealed in \"Thunder Dog\" that he is exceedingly afraid of girls. In \"True Spies\", it is revealed that Keswick is an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] from Keswickia who is wanted by the Keswickian Police for cooking stinky fish at work, as his planet is very strict.\n* T.U.F.F. Troopers \u2013 The foot soldiers of T.U.F.F. who resemble older versions of Dudley.\n\nAlso in T.U.F.F. are various personnel that appear as background characters whether as agents, office workers, and/or scientists. Some of the minor members of T.U.F.F. that have been identified or mentioned include:\n\n* Agent [[Amoeba]] \u2013 A microscopic T.U.F.F. Agent who the Chief mentioned to have helped him start Spackle and Grout Day in \"Lie Like a Dog\".\n* Agent [[Ant]] \u2013 An ant T.U.F.F. Agent who was incorrectly paired with Agent Anteater in \"Match Me If You Can\".\n* Agent [[Anteater]] \u2013 An anteater T.U.F.F. Agent who was incorrectly paired with Agent Ant in \"Match Me If You Can\".\n* Agent Bacon \u2013 A [[pig]] T.U.F.F. Agent that is seen in \"Super Duper Crime Busters\". It is implied that he has a hobby of knitting.\n* Agent [[Big Bad Wolf]] \u2013 A [[Gray wolf|wolf]] T.U.F.F. agent who was incorrectly paired with Agent Three Little Pigs in \"Match Me If You Can\".\n* Agent Bossy (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 A [[Cattle|cow]] T.U.F.F. Agent that is seen in \"Mall Rat\" and \"The Wrong Stuff\". She tends to surf the internet to find meat that would be insensitive to her.\n* Agent [[Chicago Bulls|Bull]] \u2013 A [[cattle]] T.U.F.F. Agent that is seen in \"Happy Howl-O-Ween\". He is based on the stereotype that bulls get angry when they see the color red.\n* Agent [[Goldfish]] (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 A T.U.F.F.

He resides under an office printer and is the one who tells about the end of winter.\n* Agent [[Guinea pig|Guinea Pig]] \u2013 A T.U.F.F. Agent who only appeared in \"Candy Cane-Ine\" so far. He was seen running on a hamster wheel.\n* Agent Hammerhead \u2013 A [[hammerhead shark]] T.U.F.F. Agent who was first seen in \"Puppy Unplugged\".\n* Agent Jumbo (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 An [[elephant]] T.U.F.F. Agent who has a fear of mice which would result in her jumping up when she sees them and accidentally crushing anyone.\n* Agent Kid \u2013 A [[goat]] T.U.F.F. Agent who was first seen in \"Pup Daddy\". He is known to eat cans including the ones that are in the recycling bin.\n* Agent Moby (voiced by [[Matthew W. Taylor]]) \u2013 A [[whale]] T.U.F.F. Agent who appeared in \"A Doomed Christmas\". Like Agent Jumbo, Agent Moby also has a tendency to accidentally crush the Chief.\n* Agent [[Mouse]] \u2013 A mouse T.U.F.F. Agent who was incorrectly paired with Agent Snake in \"Match Me If You Can\" where he was swallowed whole by Agent Snake.\n* Agent Nutz (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 A [[squirrel]] T.U.F.F. Agent who would always freak out about something completely random and blast it with his laser.\n* Agent [[Scarecrow]] \u2013 A T.U.F.F. Agent that is not based on any animal. So far, he has only been seen in \"Mom-A-Geddon\".\n* Agent Seabiscuit (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 A [[horse]] T.U.F.F. Agent who first appeared in \"The Dog Who Cried Fish\". He is shown to be offended when somebody claimed that they can \"eat like a horse\".\n* Agent [[Sea cucumber|Sea Cucumber]] \u2013 A T.U.F.F. Agent that appeared in \"Acting T.U.F.F\".\n* Agent [[Skunk]] \u2013 A T.U.F.F. Agent that appeared in \"T.U.F.F.

Agents who were incorrectly paired with Agent Big Bad Wolf in \"Match Me If You Can\".\n* George Looney \u2013 A [[loon]] that works as a [[janitor]] at T.U.F.F. and is a descendant of Petropolis' founder Daniel Boone Looney. George Looney has so far been only seen in \"Legal Beagle\".\n* Sally Mander (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 A [[salamander]] that works as a [[secretary]] at T.U.F.F. Her name is a pun on \"salamander\".\n* Scary Jimmy  (voiced by [[Matthew W. Taylor]]) \u2013 A bull that works as a [[janitor]] at T.U.F.F. He is a very suspicious and strange person. Scary Jimmy is implied to be somewhat of a shut-in, mentally unstable, paranoid and potentially harmful. He has stated that he can memorize the backs of people's heads.\n* Tammy (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 A rabbit that works as a [[secretary]] at T.U.F.F.\n\n====Main villains====\n* Verminous Snaptrap (voiced by [[Matthew W. Taylor]]) \u2013 A [[rat]] who is the leader of the Diabolical Order of Mayhem. Despite being a rat, he is allergic to cheese which causes him to swell up. Like his nemesis Dudley Puppy, he is hyperactive, immature, and airheaded. However, unlike Dudley, he doesn't show intellectual potential. He is often easily frustrated when his fellow D.O.O.M. members do something foolish. A running gag is Snaptrap throwing Larry, Dudley, Kitty, or others into his shark tank (which never actually kills any of them). In \"Operation: Happy Birthday\", it's revealed that he still lives with his mother. Later on in \"Dog Dish\", it's revealed that his mother buys all of Snaptrap's evil gadgets. That same episode shows that he has a blog, and that he uses his gadgets for incredibly stupid plans such as sneaking into movie theaters. Although, on some occasions, he has shown to be able to do true evil, such as launching the entire town into the sun (as seen in \"Mall Rat\" when he faked his reform). After most defeats, he shouts \"I will now plot my revenge!\" In \"Forget Me Mutt\", it's shown that he's verbally abused by his mother. In \"Mind Trap\", he's shown to go dumpster diving for food.\n* The [[Chameleon]] (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]) \u2013 A [[chameleon]] in a molecular transformation suit which allows him to shapeshift into virtually any disguise or inanimate object. In \"Doom-mates\", his name is pronounced \"The Cham-a-leon\" as a running gag he wanted to get revenge on Kitty Katswell by blowing her up nine times but Dudley heroically thwarted his evil plan, thus saving her. He talks like Peter Lorre and eats any bug he sees, a trait used against him several times. His relationship with D.O.O.M. seems rather strained, since he tends to work separately from the others and once planned to trick them and T.U.F.F. to destroy each other. He said he wanted to go to D.O.O.M.'s weekly ice cream socials, but he was never invited. The Chameleon later teamed up with D.O.O.M. in \"Mission: Really Big Mission,\" ending with him being blasted into space (which he somehow survived). As a running gag, he often tries to wear some type of eyewear only to have his eyes go around or through them, as his chameleon eyes constantly bug around and look in separate directions, which creeps Dudley out, as seen in \"Doom-Mates.\" He can sometimes be very random when disguised. Whenever he's in disguise, he tends to say random things relating to his disguise (For example, in \"Internal Affairs,\" disguised as General Warhog tells the soldiers \"semper fi\" and \"remember the Alamo\"). Oddly, whenever the story has him using a disguise for a long time as a major plot point, his voice is never disguised, despite him being able to disguise it during the short disguises in other episodes (although this may be because he experiences a sort of discomfort by mimicking voices, forcing him to do it rarely, but this is just speculation, and it has yet to be explained). Another oddity is that Dudley can never tell when the Chameleon is disguised or what he is disguised as, despite him having the sharp nose of a bloodhound (possibly the Chameleon can disguise his smell, too). If the Chameleon is splashed with liquid while in disguise, his suit will short circuit and he will be forced to return to normal (although he notes that it's only on the outside, as inside, it makes him feel bloated). Also, his suit is wired into his brain and if it's removed, he will have no choice but return to his normal form.\n* Bird Brain (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) \u2013 Bird Brain is an evil [[Blue-footed booby|blue-bottomed booby]] Resambles [[flamingo]] genius who can't fly with his wings (something he always forgets). Despite his species name's origin which is from the Spanish word \"bobo\" or \"stupid\", he is more intelligent and competent than both Snaptrap and the Chameleon. Bird Brain seems to be quite intelligent and capable at his job. Like Snaptrap, he is very easily frustrated by his comrades, whom tend to be genuinely much more foolish than Snaptrap's smarter and more villainous gang. In \"Thunder Dog\" it is revealed that he is prematurely bald. In \"A Doomed Christmas\", it is revealed that although he looks old he is only 23. In \"Hush Puppy\", it is revealed that he lost his hair at a young age due to stress.\n\n=====Snaptrap's Henchmen or D.O.O.M.=====\n\n* Larry (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 A [[shrew]] who is Verminious Snaptrap's brother-in-law (Larry's married to Snaptrap's sister) and one of his three main henchmen. Despite being considered dim-witted by Snaptrap, Larry is the second smartest and most intelligent of his three main henchmen. Larry often infuriates Snaptrap by talking back to him or, on a few occasions, making mistakes, which results in him either getting blasted by a laser or thrown into the shark tank. In \"Doom and Gloom\", the recent abuse from Snaptrap and him not listening to Larry's advice not to tell T.U.F.F. of his plans causes Larry to splinter off from Snaptrap and forms G.L.O.O.M. (short for Genius Larry's Order of Mayhem) with Ollie and Francisco where Larry operated under the alias of Murray. While planning a plot to turn off Petropolis' power and cover the whole city in fog emitted from a fog machine, Larry had G.L.O.O.M's temporary headquarters in the sewing room owned by Snaptrap's mom. With help from Snaptrap, Dudley and Kitty were able to stop Larry's plot and get Larry, Ollie, and Francisco back onto D.O.O.M. In \"True Spies\", it is revealed that Snaptrap actually doesn't hate Larry, but only mistreated him because he believes he has much potential to be malignant.\n* Ollie (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 A sensible and smart British [[opossum]] who is one of Snaptrap's main henchmen. Ollie is Snaptrap's voice of reason whom he often ignores. A recurring gag in the series is that Ollie is the one who accidentally gives Snaptrap something cheese related either forgetting about his boss's cheese allergy or Snaptrap idiotically forgetting it himself. Another gag involving him is that Ollie is the one who gives Snaptrap the ideas for his evil plans due to a misunderstanding that Snaptrap has already come up with a plan only to reveal it's just something he likes to do (i.e. in \"Iron Mutt\", he thinks that Snaptrap has planned to trap the principal of the local high school and impersonate her due to the large mousetrap and the dress he's wearing which Snaptrap, who just really liked wearing dresses, quickly covers up by saying that was his plan). In \"True Spies\", it is revealed that Ollie isn't really British, but uses a British accent to make himself sound smart.\n* Francisco (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]) \u2013 An [[alligator]] Resembles [[Lowland Gorilla]] who is one of Snaptrap's three main henchmen. He is also the only one of Snaptrap's henchman who seems to take villainy seriously. In \"Dog Dish\", he kept trying to convince Snaptrap to use the invisibility helmet for more evil deeds than sneaking into the movies. In \"True Spies\", it is revealed that Francisco's real name is Francesca because his parents wanted a girl.\n* Bad Dog (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]] in the first appearance, [[Daran Norris]] in later appearances) \u2013 A [[pit bull]] and one of Snaptrap's henchmen. He is often seen with a black torn sleeveless shirt with a skull on it (similar to [[Punisher]]'s T-shirt). Bad Dog is often paired up with Leather Teddy. He stops appearing after the first season.\n* Leather Teddy (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]) \u2013 A leather clad blue bear and one of Snaptrap's henchmen that wears an eyepatch (though the first episode shows that he still has an eye under the eyepatch). He wields bear traps on chains for weapons. Leather Teddy's outfit gives him the appearance of a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|biker]]. He is often paired up with Bad Dog. He stops appearing after the first season.\n* The [[Mole (animal)|Mole]] (voiced by Matthew W. Taylor) \u2013 A mole agent who is Snaptrap's master of infiltration. He stops appearing after the first season.\n*[[Skunk]] (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 A skunk who is one of Snaptrap's henchmen. So far, he has only appeared in \"Cruisin' with a Bruisin\".\n*Snaptrap is also shown to have other, unnamed minions over the course of the show, but they never have major roles, and eventually stopped appearing.\n\n=====Bird Brain's Henchmen=====\n\n* Zippy (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 Zippy is Bird Brain's scatterbrained [[hummingbird]] sidekick/partner who constantly encourages him to fly, despite the fact that his subspecies is incapable of it (although real-life boobies are able to fly). Whenever Owl and Bat would say \"Who?\" and \"Where?\" respectively, Zippy occasionally adds \"Why?\" which often infuriates Bird Brain.\n*[[Owl]] (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 Owl is one of Bird Brain's henchmen upon being hired by Zippy. He and Bat are both very incompetent where he would often infuriate his boss by saying \"Who?\".\n*[[Bat]] (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]) \u2013 Bat is one of Bird Brain's henchmen upon them being hired by Zippy. He and Owl are both very incompetent where he would infuriate his boss by saying \"Where?\" in response to the orders given to him. Bat is suggested to be blind (although he occasionally does his job exactly as told implying that he has some vision and he is apparently slightly smarter than Owl). Bird Brain seems to like Bat more because at one point in \"Thunder Dog\", Bat did his job exactly as he was told without saying his usual \"Where?\" This surprised Bird Brain while Owl idiotically said his usual \"Who?\", as Bird Brain threatened to hit Owl with a boulder.\n*[[Duck]] (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 A duck who is one of Bird Brain's more recent henchmen as seen in \"Puppy Unplugged\". He can speak in both duck and human languages. Whenever someone says his name, other people \"duck\" for cover because they think that something is coming right at them. In \"Puppy Unplugged\", it is revealed that his real name is \"Skip\", causing everyone to skip around happily.\n* Ewe (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 A female [[sheep]] who is one of Bird Brain's more recent henchmen as seen in \"Monkey Business\".\n*[[Fly]] \u2013 A small purple fly who is one of Bird Brain's henchmen as seen in \"Bad Eggs\" (although he never signed the application, and is in fact just a housefly). When Bird Brain says his name, his henchmen start flying around him.\n* Peck Me \u2013 A [[goose]] who is one of Bird Brain's henchmen in \"Barking Tall\". When Bird Brain says his name, his henchmen start pecking him.\n* Holy Cow (voiced by [[Maddie Taylor|Matthew W. Taylor]]) - A cow who is another one of Bird Brain's henchmen. He was first seen in \"Love Bird\". His first appearance is when Bird Brain said \"Holy cow!\" Holy Cow thinks Bird Brain called him, but Bird Brain said \"Not you, Holy Cow.\" His second appearance is when Bird Brain calls him again, but Bird Brain says, \"No, get back in the [[minivan]].\" He [[Fourth wall|breaks the fourth wall]] when Bird Brain calls him one more time, but Bird Brain says \"Don't\".)\n\n===Recurring characters===\n====Other villains====\n\n* R.I.T.A. (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 R.I.T.A. is a super-intelligent toaster created by Keswick. She stops Snaptrap and the Chameleon, but when Keswick attempts to unplug her because T.U.F.F. is eco-friendly, R.I.T.A. turned evil and attempted to take over the city. With the help of Keswick's hologram, Dudley makes her to fall to her death on a cliff and into a lake. Some of her lines and actions suggest that she (at least in part) is a parody of the evil computer H.A.L. from ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.\n* Snowflake and Slush (voiced by [[Mary Birdsong]] and [[Dave Boat]]) \u2013 Snowflake and Slush are evil [[rabbit]] siblings who dress up as vegetables and cheat in events by eliminating and kidnapping the winners. Snowflake is the mastermind of the two, while Slush possesses little to no intelligence, who in his sister's words is \"dumber than a box of hair\" (she should know, she used to skate with one, and claims it was smarter than him). Despite his immense stupidity, he is very competent with Snowflake's plan and when it is ruined, he is shown to be just as angry at the failure and desperate to escape as Snowflake is.\n* Dr. Rabies and Madame Catastrophe (voiced by [[Jerry Trainor]] and [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 Two villains who resemble Dudley Puppy and Kitty Katswell except that their evil twins wear eye patches and have goatees on their chins. They only appeared in \"The Doomies\".\n* Mad Cow \u2013 Mad Cow is an angry [[Cattle|bull]] who first appeared in \"Snap Dad\" trying to escape from jail. Mad Cow's escape was a success at the time when Snaptrap was a T.U.F.F. Agent and dating Peg. He tried to escape Petropolis Prison with Snaptrap's help as seen in \"Dog Dish\", but he was stopped by Dudley and Kitty. His name is a reference to \"[[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|mad cow disease]]\".\n* Crazy [[Horse]] \u2013 Crazy Horse is a horse who uses chainsaws (he even whinnies while using chainsaws). He tried to escape Petropolis Prison with Snaptrap's help as seen in \"Dog Dish\", but he was stopped by Dudley and Kitty. He ends up getting Snaptrap as his cellmate. His name is a reference to the Native American leader [[Crazy Horse]].\n*[[Wild turkey|Wild Turkey]] \u2013 Wild Turkey is a [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]] who tried to escape Petropolis Prison with Snaptrap's help as seen in \"Dog Dish\", but he was stopped by Dudley and Kitty.\n* Kung Pow [[Chicken]] \u2013 Kung Pow Chicken is a chicken talented in martial arts. He tried to escape Petropolis Prison with Snaptrap's help as seen in \"Dog Dish\", but he got arrested thanks to Kitty. His name is a pun on [[Kung Pao chicken|Kung Pao Chicken]].\n* Jack [[Rabbit]] (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]) \u2013 Jack Rabbit is a former elite T.U.F.F. agent and Kitty's former partner who is a parody of James Bond, he had turned evil, attempting to drain secret agents' brains with his organization S.T.U.F.F. (short for Super Turbo Undercover Fighting Force) and sell their secrets to villains along with the building to earn money. Greedy, clever, arrogant, and dishonest, Jack attempted to lure Kitty into a trap so he could steal her information (mostly to get money from Snaptrap), but was defeated by Dudley and Keswick. Judging by a line from Kitty in \"The Wrong Stuff\", she and Jack were supposedly a couple once. He and Snaptrap are arrested by Dudley and Keswick. He later attempted to woo Kitty (who was actually Dudley, and had previously used a Brain-Swapping device on himself earlier) into letting him steal the T.U.F.F. computer database. He was once again defeated,\n* The Caped [[Cod]] (voiced by [[Chris Parnell]] in the first appearance, [[Mick Wingert]] in later appearances) \u2013 The Caped Cod is a crazy cod who thinks he is the ruler of the seven seas, and thinks that Dudley is the king of the surface world and talks to inanimate objects at the bottom of the sea that he thinks are his subjects. He once tried to flood Petropolis but was stopped by Kitty and Dudley and was put in an aquarium for the criminally insane. His name is a reference to [[Cape Cod|Cape Cod, Massachusetts]]. In \"Cold Fish\", the Caped Cod escapes from his incarceration and tried to flood Petropolis again in order to make it part of his kingdom by melting the Riceberg Ice Bird Iceberg. He also did this to get revenge on Bryce Riceberg because she didn't invite him to her wedding (which he did, and the Caped Cod just never read his mail. He later returned to his plan, as the Ricebergs were serving fish) and they were best friends in middle school. The Caped Cod was once again defeated in the end.\n*[[Pentatomidae|Stink Bug]] (voiced by [[Carlos Alazraqui]]) \u2013 Stink Bug is Petropolis' worst smelling villain who was kicked out of Petropolis for smelling so bad. He is very rude and cruel to his intern Percival (who kept suggesting for Stink Bug to take a bath). Because of his very strong odor, Dudley's super sensitive snout made him powerless. When it came to stinking up Petropolis with a combined odor of the stuff he stole, Percival gave away the name of the Stink Bug's device causing Stink Bug to fire him and send him down the trap door. In order to combat Stink Bug Dudley caught Keswick's cold. Dudley defeated Stink Bug and was taken to jail by Percival.\n* Lunch Lady Bug (voiced by [[Candi Milo]]) \u2013 A [[Coccinellidae|ladybug]] who worked as a [[lunch lady]] at Petropolis High School and makes disgusting food that only Dudley likes. It was even mentioned that she received warning letters from the Health Department involving her dishes. She tried to destroy everyone at the High School Reunion only to be defeated by Dudley and Kitty. A goof is that she is depicted with eight legs when ladybugs have six legs.\n* F.L.O.P.P. \u2013 Short for Fiendish League of Potential Perpetrators, F.L.O.P.P. is a criminal organization that would often do minor criminal activities and use the tool shed at a golf course. A running gag about them is that they find dangerous weapons that are left in the lost and found by Verminious Snaptrap.\n**[[Meerkat]] (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]) \u2013 A meerkat who is the eccentric leader of F.L.O.P.P. with a black cowboy hat. In \"Bluff Puppy\", it is revealed that he is diabetic.\n** Wanna-Bee (voiced by [[Jerry Trainor]] in a high-pitch voice) \u2013 A [[bee]] who is a member of F.L.O.P.P. His name is a play on \"[[wikt:wannabe|wannabe]]\". In \"The Spelling Bee\", Wanna-Bee temporarily operated his own stand-alone villain career as the Spelling Bee where he was capturing spelling bee competitors while the rest of F.L.O.P.P. were on jury duty.\n** Escape Goat (voiced by [[Matthew W. Taylor]]) \u2013 A [[goat]] who is a member of F.L.O.P.P. and is an [[Escapology|escape artist]]. His name is a play on \"scapegoat\".\n**[[Fiddler crab|Fiddler Crab]] \u2013 A [[fiddle]]-playing [[crab]] who is a member of F.L.O.P.P. So far, he has only appeared in \"Top Dog\".\n** Missing [[Lynx]] \u2013 A lynx who is mentioned as a member of F.L.O.P.P. as he is \"missing as usual\". Missing Lynx's name is a play on \"[[Transitional fossil|missing link]]\".\n** Bluffalo (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 A [[Bison|buffalo]] that is a member of F.L.O.P.P. in \"Bluff Puppy\". He has a tendency to tell bluffs. Bluffalo is also an old friend of Meerkat.\n* Quacky the [[Duck]] (voiced by [[Matthew W. Taylor]]) \u2013 Quacky the Duck was originally a kid show host seen in \"Kid Stuff\". Dudley, Chief, and Keswick all watch Quacky's show, but Dudley is his biggest fan and the captain of his unofficial fan club. When his show was cancelled, Quacky wanted to get revenge by blasting the TV Chairman with a nuclear missile with Dudley and Kitty tied to it. He was arrested by Dudley and his show is now in prison where he has Revenge Rabbit show viewers how to get revenge on the jury that convicts anyone. In \"Lucky Duck\", Quacky the Duck is released from prison and establishes a restaurant. In \"Quack in the Box\", he and Sharing Moose are released from prison and start a fast food chain. They try to get revenge on Dudley by framing him for taking out the competition against other fast food chains using action figures of characters from Quacky's show. However, his plan was discovered and he was stopped once again. He later appeared again in \"Lights, Camera, Quacktion\" when it was revealed that he lost his TV show and seek revenge on T.U.F.F. by framing Dudley, Kitty, Keswick and the Chief into thinking that he was going to make a movie and having them commit serious crimes such as stealing a truck, steal gold from [[Fort Knox|Fort Ox]], and loading them into a ship to Canada. His plan almost worked, but was foiled by T.U.F.F. Quacky makes another appearance in \"Quacky Birthday\", where he wants to shut T.U.F.F. down once and for all. He pretends he has a party room for Dudley's birthday party. Because of that, Dudley lets him and the Sharing Moose to take things from stores without arresting them. Once the T.U.F.F. agents are in his \"party place\", Quacky locks them in with dynamites. However, Dudley manages to save T.U.F.F. and arrest him. In \"T.U.F.F. Cookies\", Quacky the Duck hires Dudley to help promote his Animal Quackers. He was thwarted again by Dudley. In \"The Good, the Bad, and the Quacky\", Quacky the Duck hosts a TV show that pits Dudley, Kitty, Keswick, and Chief against Verminious Snaptrap, Chameleon, and Birdbrain. When the game started to get deadly, T.U.F.F. had to work together with Verminious Snaptrap, Chameleon, and Birdbrain to survive the game show and defeat Quacky.\n** The Sharing [[Moose]] (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 A moose that is the buff and violent best friend of Quacky the Duck. He constantly reminds viewers important stuff like \"Not to commit internet fraud\" or \"never leave town without telling your [[parole officer]] or he will hunt you down\". The Sharing Moose's actor appears to be doing community service since he seems to be from jail.\n* Katty Katswell (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 Kitty Katswell's evil twin sister. She was first mentioned in \"Diary of a Mad Cat\" where it is stated that she is in prison. As a criminal, she commits crimes such as [[armed robbery]], [[grand theft auto]], and [[insurance fraud]]. Katty debuted in \"A Tale of Two Kitties\" where she escapes from prison to take revenge on her sister who put her in prison. Katty does this by swapping places with her own sister to steal 24 carat Golden Fishbowl from the Petropolis Art Museum exhibit in which Dudley and Kitty have assignments to protect this. Dudley didn't know that where his partner was swapped by Katty. Katty was eventually found out, ends up defeated by Dudley and Kitty, and is sent back to prison.\n* The [[Weasel]] (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 The Weasel is a super diabolical villain. He targeted Dudley Puppy (who had placed him in prison) and Verminious Snaptrap (who once impersonated him) prompting Kitty Katswell to pose as their mother at Chief's version of a safe house. He did various attempts at Dudley and Snaptrap's lives which even included one where he went straight and gave them a [[jack-in-the-box]] bomb. After that attempt, Dudley and Kitty found the Weasel's house and were able to defeat him. The Weasel was imprisoned and became a cellmate of Snaptrap who was also arrested for looting the Weasel's house.\n* Rumble Bee (voiced by [[Matthew W. Taylor]]) \u2013 The Rumble Bee is the older, and more evil, brother of Wanna-Bee. When Keswick accidentally created an army of mutant laser-firing bees (one of which was the Rumble Bee himself), he quickly became their leader. Wanna-Bee, resenting his brother for his accomplishments, joined T.U.F.F. in defeating him.\n* The Overbear (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 The Overbear is a villain, known for his extremely overbearing personality. In \"T.U.F.F. Break Up,\" The Chief asks him to help bring T.U.F.F. back together, as he was The Chief's former bowling partner, resulting in Dudley and Kitty retrieving Birdbrain's mayonnaise for him. He is then revealed to actually be evil, and using Birdbrain's \"Obey-o-naise\" to brainwash Petropolis. He was then defeated. He was only seen in \"T.U.F.F. Break Up.\"\n\n====Citizens of Petropolis====\n\n* Peg Puppy (voiced by [[Leslie Carrara-Rudolph]]) \u2013 Peg is Dudley's over-protective mother. She once dated Snaptrap and the Chameleon. In \"Mom-A-Geddon\", she disapproves of Dudley's occupation, but after seeing him in action, allows him to keep his job. She thinks that Kitty is Dudley's secretary, and never gets her name right. She usually bothers Dudley when he's home. In \"Snap Dad\", she's shown to not have her husband after Dudley's father married her which means she's either divorced or widowed.\n* Mrs. Katswell (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 Mrs. Katswell is Kitty's mother who first appeared in a flashback in \"Operation: Happy Birthday\". She somewhat resembles and even sounds like her daughter. In the episode \"Diary of a Mad Cat\", the Chameleon disguises himself as Kitty's mom and reveals that Kitty has a sister named Katty who is a criminal.\n* Little [[Chipmunk]] Girl (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 An unnamed, anthropomorphic young chipmunk who was Yins best Friend and Girlfriend used basically as a running gag throughout the episode \"Mall Rat\". She is depicted as being adorably innocent and sweet and her main purpose throughout the episode was to tug at Dudley's shirt after every time Kitty thwarted one of Snaptrap's unusual acts of kindness towards the townspeople and ask why Kitty performed the action that destroyed Snaptrap's most recent contribution. She also made an appearance in \"Bored of Education\" where members T.U.F.F appeared at an elementary school during \"Career Day\" in hopes of influencing the pupils to one day join either side. She appeared as a student at the school who was poorly influenced by the Chameleon (along with all of the other students) to grow up to perform acts of villainy, and she was included to be used for the same gag that had been done in the episode \"Mall Rat\". She is revealed to use her cute looks to make people do what she wants.\n*[[Mayor]] Teddy [[Bear]] (voiced by [[Matthew W. Taylor]]) \u2013 A bear who is the Mayor of Petropolis and had preceded the previously unnamed mayor that was seen in \"Iron Mutt\". His first name is actually \"Mayor,\" and this led people to assume he was their mayor. He likes to share strange \"fun facts\" about himself, including that he can smell colors, (later saying that he was off his medicine) can cross his eyes backwards, and keeps chopped liver in the city safe.\n* Rodger (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 Rodger is Dudley's friend. He was only shown once in \"Mall Rat\" for the punchline of a joke.\n* General [[Warthog]] (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 A warthog who is the general of Petropolis' army.\n* Wolf Spitzer (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]) \u2013 Wolf Spitzer is a [[gray wolf]] who is Petropolis local [[News presenter|news reporter]] for KPET News. He is a parody of [[Wolf Blitzer]].\n* Eric (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]) \u2013 A buff cat who delivers the water to T.U.F.F. Kitty has a crush on him.\n* Becky (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) \u2013 A dog who manages loans at the First Petropolis Bank. Dudley has a crush on her, and in \"Love Puppy,\" shields her from the blast from Bird Brain's \"Lovey-Dovey-Kissy-Smoochy\" gun and later returns her feelings to him.\n* Bob Barky (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]) \u2013 A dog game show host who hosts various game shows in Petropolis. He is a parody of [[Bob Barker]].\n* Phil (voiced by [[Matthew W. Taylor]]) \u2013 Phil is a bulldog who is Dudley's friend. He is never shown, but is described with something gross related to a wart or boil. His first appearance was in \"Lie Like a Dog\" where he is shown to live near the bus station and is implied by Dudley to have wealthy parents. In \"Puppy Unplugged\", Dudley revealed that Phil is married yet his wife hasn't been seen yet.\n* Mr. Wong (voiced by [[Matthew W. Taylor]]) \u2013 A duck who is the owner of \"Wong's Chinese Buffet\". He has a grudge against Dudley for eating ten thousand dollars' worth of food, and keeping his unfinished food in his shirt for later. He was also seen in \"T.U.F.F. Break Up,\" renting out half of T.U.F.F. for his dry-cleaning business.\n\n==Production==\n[[Butch Hartman]] said that he created the central character and wanted to make a crime-fighting show based on him. Because his previous animated series ''[[Danny Phantom]]'' already involved superheroes, Hartman decided that he would focus on making Dudley a secret agent. He pitched the series to [[Nickelodeon]] as \"''[[Get Smart]]'' with a dog.\"<ref name=\"toon\"/>\n\n[[Eric Bauza]], (who voices Foop in ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'' and Leather Teddy in ''T.U.F.F. Puppy'') was originally chosen to be the voice of Dudley Puppy, but the creators didn't feel that he was right for the character and [[Jerry Trainor]] was chosen instead.<ref name=\"toon\">{{cite web|url=https://animesuperhero.com/toonzone-news-interviews-butch-hartman-on-t-u-f-f-puppy//|title=Interview with Butch Hartman|date=29 September 2010|work=Toon Zone|accessdate=29 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe original title of the show was ''Stud Puppy''.<ref>https://twitter.com/realhartman/status/926883234008276992</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n{{Update|section|date=January 2017}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+''T.U.F.F.

Each use their own powers to help protect the citizens of their land, clean the planet, and make the world a better place.\n\nEach episode begins with a problem with nature seen on Earth. A rainbow is sent to Kaleidoscopia and Kalia calls all seven rangers and Floof to her. After they are shown the nature problem, Kalia chooses the three ideal rangers for the mission, Floof always joins the three on their scooters. When the mission is completed, the three rangers return to Kaleidoscopia on their scooters.\n\n==Characters==\n=== Main Characters ===\n* Rosie Redd (voiced by Aileen Mythen) is the leader. She represents the color Red, and possesses Strength Power. \n* Mandarin \"Mandy\" Orange (voiced by Aileen Mythen) is the cheerleader of the group. She represents the color Orange, and possesses Music Power. \n* Anna Banana (voiced by Juliette Crosbie) is naive and sweet who can talk to animals. She represents the color Yellow, and possesses Animal Power. She carries a yellow stuffed rabbit, Mr. Stuffie Wuffie, which is used for comforting animals.\n* Pepper Mintz (voiced by Phillipa Alexander) is a shy, introverted bookworm who loves to read. She represents the color Green, and possesses Inviso Power. \n* Bonnie \"B.B.\" Blueberry (voiced by [[Zehra Naqvi|Zehra Jane Naqvi]]) is analytical and smart. She always says that things are logical or illogical. She represents the color Blue, and possesses Vision Power.\n* Indigo \"Indy\" Allfruit (voiced by Penelope Rawlins) has super speed, and is a prankster. She represents the color Indigo, and possesses Speed Power.\n* Lavender LaViolette (voiced by Penelope Rawlins) is a fashionista. She represents the color Violet, and possesses Micro Power.\n* Floof (voiced by Phillipa Alexander) is the Rangers' pet Prismacorn (according to B.B.). He accompanies them on their mission and helps out by using his magical horn. There is a running gag where Floof comes out of his door in a surprising or funny way.\n* Kalia (voiced by Phillipa Alexander) is the leader of Kaleidoscopia and when she sees trouble in the world she calls the rangers to the rescue.\n\n=== Villains ===\n* Preston Praxton (voiced by Dan Russell) is the Rangers' main antagonist. A greedy entrepreneur, he schemes with no regard for any environmental impact, causing the Rangers to try and stop him. He has a seemingly endless supply of booby traps to keep the Rangers from interfering with his business.\n* Patty Praxton (voiced by Zehra Jane Naqvi) is Preston's daughter, and while she does take after her money-loving father, she often serves as his voice of reason, and is on friendlier terms with the Rangers.\n\n==Production==\nIn September 2016, Genius Brands announced that they were partnering with ''[[The Lion King]]'' and ''[[Flypaper (2011 film)|Flypaper]]'' director [[Rob Minkoff]] and ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'' writer Shane Morris on their new ''Rainbow Rangers'' series.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Terry|first1=Joshua|title=TV News Roundup: Leah Remini Developing Scientology Series;
