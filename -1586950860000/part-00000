This railroad ran from [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick, Md]] to the Pennsylvania-Maryland State line, or [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]] near [http://goo.gl/maps/4A6FB Kingsdale,PA]. Chartered in 1867, the railroad started construction in 1869 and cost $868,687.50 ($<sub>{{CURRENTISOYEAR}}</sub>={{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|868687.5|1872|r=-3}}}}). It opened October 8, 1872 and was subsequently leased to the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] from January 1, 1875 and in July of that year, PRR formed a new division, the Frederick division to operate the rail line. In the spring of 1896, it was [[Foreclosure sale#Strict foreclosure.2Fjudicial foreclosure|liquidated in a judicial sale]] to the Pennsylvania Railroad for 10% of its 1896 book value. Pennsylvania reorganized the railroad in December, 1896 as the [[Frederick and Northern Railroad|Frederick and Northern Railroad Company]]. In March 1897, this new company was itself merged with other Pennsylvania-controlled railways ([[Littlestown Railroad Company|Littlestown Railroad]] and the [[Hanover and York Railroad|Hanover and York Railroad Company]]) into the [[York, Hanover and Frederick Railroad|Hanover and York Railroad Company]], chartered under the general laws of Pennsylvania and Maryland. In 1914, this railroad and the newly built [[Central Railroad of Maryland]] were then merged into the [[York, Hanover and Frederick Railway|York, Hanover and Frederick Railway Company]] which remained a [[Subsidiary|wholly owned stock subsidiary]] of the PRR into the creation of the [[Penndel Company|PennDel]] company in December 31, 1953<ref>{{cite web|title=THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD COMPANY: Corporate, Financial and Construction History Of Lines Owned, Operated and Controlled To December 31, 1945.|url=http://digital.hagley.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/p16038coll12|publisher=by Coverdale & Colpitts digitized by the Hagley Museum|accessdate=24 December 2013}}</ref>  and then the [[Penn Central]] merger in 1968 and then bankruptcy in 1970. The Frederick and Pennsylvania Line segment was transferred to the State of Maryland in 1982 for unpaid taxes.\n\nOne of the industries that fed the railroad during its earliest time of operations was the Lime Kiln in Walkersville. This was among the industries that fueled the need of the railroad, to ship fertilizer to farmers in and around the Walkersville region. The Frederick Secondary remained in the control of the Pennsylvania Railroad even into the creation of the Penn Central Railroad. The Walkersville Southern operates on part of the [[Penn Central]]'s Frederick Secondary. Penn Central, then in bankruptcy, sold the line to the state of Maryland in 1972 after [[Hurricane Agnes]] washed out the bridge over the [[Monocacy River]]. The line remained dormant until 1980 when the [[Maryland Midland Railway]] began operations over the route between Walkersville north to Taneytown. South of Walkersville the right-of-way, devoid of freight customers, was overtaken by brush and weeds.\n\nVolunteers for the new Walkersville Southern began restoring the line in 1991. The State of Maryland awarded the company operation of the line south of Walkersville in 1993 and tourist trains began running to the Monocacy River in 1995. The bridge was rebuilt, completed in March 1996, and trains began crossing the river, 23 years after Agnes. In 1998, the line was rebuilt to its current terminus at [[Maryland Route 26]] in [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]]. Although crossing Maryland Route 26 was in the original plan to reach potential freight customers in downtown Frederick, the rise in automobile traffic over Route 26 and the departure of potential customers from Frederick led to the eventual abandonment of any further restoration plans into the city. Current local government plans call for the old right-of-way south of Route 26 to be converted into a hiker-biker trail.\n\nIn November 2008, Maryland granted rights to operate three miles of right-of-way to the north, linking to the Maryland Midland Railway at North Glade Road.  In 2013 the summer steam excursion was routed over a portion of the newly restored track. As of the January 1st, 2014 the north division has been restored.\n\n==Operations==\nToday, the railroad runs two to three round trips daily on Saturdays and Sundays in May, June, September, and October; and on Saturdays only in July and August.  They also host some special events, including some on weekends and during the off-season. In some cases individuals with their own equipment can use the right of way with prior permission or during selected special events.\n\nThe railroad typically operates unique industrial diesel locomotives, all rarely seen in today's modern railroading. In 2012, the railroad operated steam excursions for the first time using the Gramling Locomotive Works \"Flagg Coal 75\" an 0-4-0T tank engine. The 75's operation marked the first time a steam locomotive had operated on this railway since the Pennsylvania Railroad last ran steam over 60 years ago. In 2013, steam returned in the form of Lehigh Valley Coal 126, also owned by the Gramling family. In 2018, after the addition of Crossing Signals the railroad turned over to Jeddo Coal 85, also owned by the GLW, due to 126's blind axle causing problems with the detection devices at the crossing.\n\n===Diesel locomotives===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Number\n!Image\n!Builder\n!Type\n!Date\n!Status\n!Note\n|-\n|[[Walkersville Southern #1|W&WRR/WSRR 1]]\n|[http://www.rrpicturearchives.net/showPicture.aspx?id=2667196]\n|[[Plymouth Locomotive Works]]\n|18-ton [[switcher]]\n|1941\n|Display\n|Formerly operated by the Wilmington & Western Railroad\n|-\n|[[Walkersville Southern #2|WSRR 2]]\n|[http://www.rrpicturearchives.net/showPicture.aspx?id=1656674]\n|[[Davenport Locomotive Works]]\n|25-ton switcher\n|1939\n|Operational.

A related term, {{math|''p''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, is the ratio {{math|''Q''<sub>''k''</sub> ''/'' ''Q''<sub>''total''</sub>}}, which describes the fractional energy released. The term {{math|&kappa;<sub>1</sub>}} is the variance in natural time:<ref>Varotsos, Sarlis & Skordas 2011 (book), pages 121 & 131</ref>\n\n: <math>\\kappa_1=\\sum_{k=1}^N p_k(\\chi_k)^2 - \\bigl(\\sum_{k=1}^N p_k\\chi_k\\bigr)^2</math>\n\n: where <math>\\textstyle\\chi_k=k/N</math> and <math>\\textstyle\\ p_k=\\frac{Q_k}{\\sum_{n=1}^N Q_n}</math>\n\n== Time reversal ==\nTime reversal, in contrast to clock time, is applicable when studying the approach of a system to criticality with natural time analysis. Living systems for example are considered to operate far from [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]] as there is flow of energy crossing their boundaries, in contrast to deseased organisms where inner driving forces are absent. While time irreversibility is a fundamental property of a living system, the state of death is more time reversible by means of energy flow across the system's boundaries. Thus a critical state of a system can be estimated by applying natural time analysis upon calculating the entropy upon both normal time flow and time reversal and studying the difference of two results.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":0\" />[[File:Natural time as applied in cardiology.jpg|thumb|(a) [[Electrocardiography|ECG]] in which the RR distances are marked<br />\n(b) the same ECG plotted in (a) but read in natural time analysis<br />\n(c) ECG at conventional time upon time reversal<br />\n(d) ECG upon time reversal in natural time analysis<br />\nThe length between RR distances in conventional time is aproximately considered as the energy of each pulse (event) in natural time analysis.|400px|alt=|center]]\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Seismology ===\n\n==== Earthquake nowcasting ====\nIn seismology, nowcasting is the estimate of the current dynamic state of a seismological system.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> It differs from forecasting which aims to estimate the probability of a future event<ref name=\":5\" /> but it is also considered a potential base for forecasting.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Nowcasting is based on the [[earthquake cycle]] model, a recurring cycle between pairs of large earthquakes in a geographical area, upon which the system is evaluated using natural time analysis.<ref name=\":1\" /> Nowcasting calculations produce the \"earthquake potential score\", an estimation of the current level of seismic progress.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nWhen applied to seismicity, natural time analysis has the following advantages:<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n# Declustering of the aftershocks is not necessary as natural time count is evenly valid in any case of aftershock or backgroung seismicity.\n# Natural time statistics do not depend on the level of seismicity, given that the [[Gutenberg\u2013Richter law|b value]] does not significantly vary.\n\nTypical applications are: great global earthquakes and tsunamis,<ref name=\":6\" /> aftershocks and induced seismicity,<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> induced seismicity at gas fields,<ref name=\":7\" /> seismic risk to global megacities,<ref name=\":5\" /> studying of clustering of large global earthquakes,<ref name=\":8\" /> etc.\n\n==== Earthquake prediction ====\nNatural time analysis has been initially applied to [[VAN method]] in order to improve the accuracy of the estimation of the time of a forthcoming earthquake that has been indicated to occur by seismic eletric signals (SES). The method deems SES valid when \u03ba<sub>1</sub> = 0.070. Once the SES are deemed valid, a second NT analysis is started in which the subsequent seismic (rather than electric) events are noted, and the region is divided up as a [[Venn diagram]] with at least two seismic events per overlapping rectangle. When \u03ba<sub>1</sub> approaches the value \u03ba<sub>1</sub> = 0.070 for the candidate region, a critical seismic event is considered imminent, i.e. it will occur in a few days to one week or so.<ref>Varotsos, Sarlis & Skordas 2011 (book), chapter 7</ref>\n\n=== Cardiology ===\nNatural time analysis has been experimentally used for the diagnosis of [[heart failure]] syndrome<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> as well as identifying patients at high risk for [[sudden cardiac death]],<ref name=\":10\" /> even when measuring solely the heart rate, either using far more inexpensive and portable equipment (i.e. [[Pulse oximeter|oximeter]]) or [[electrocardiography]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Economy ===\nDue to similarities of the dynamic characteristics between earthquakes and financial markets, natural time analysis, which is primirily used in seismology, was chosen to assist in developing winning strategies in financial markets, with encouraging results.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n*{{Cite book\n |last1 = Varotsos |first1 = Panayiotis A.\n |last2 = Sarlis   |first2 = Nicholas V.\n |last3 = Skordas  |first3 = Efthimios S.\n |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/755081829\n |title=Natural time analysis : the new view of time ; Precursory seismic electric signals, earthquakes and other complex time series\n |date=2011\n |publisher=Springer\n |isbn=978-3-642-16449-1\n |location=Berlin\n |oclc=755081829\n}}\n\n[[Category:Statistical analysis]]\n", "text_old": "'''Natural time analysis''' is a [[Statistics|statistical method]] applied to analyze [[Complexity|complex time series]] and [[critical phenomena]], based on event counts as a measure of \"time\" rather than the [[Time|clock time]].<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite journal|last=Varotsos|first=P.

A related term, {{math|''p''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, is the ratio {{math|''Q''<sub>''k''</sub> ''/'' ''Q''<sub>''total''</sub>}}, which describes the fractional energy released. The term {{math|&kappa;<sub>1</sub>}} is the variance in natural time:<ref>Varotsos, Sarlis & Skordas 2011 (book), pages 121 & 131</ref>\n\n: <math>\\kappa_1=\\sum_{k=1}^N p_k(\\chi_k)^2 - \\bigl(\\sum_{k=1}^N p_k\\chi_k\\bigr)^2</math>\n\n: where <math>\\textstyle\\chi_k=k/N</math> and <math>\\textstyle\\ p_k=\\frac{Q_k}{\\sum_{n=1}^N Q_n}</math>\n\n== Time reversal ==\nTime reversal, in contrast to clock time, is applicable when studying the approach of a system to criticality with natural time analysis. Living systems for example are considered to operate far from [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]] as there is flow of energy crossing their boundaries, in contrast to deseased organisms where inner driving forces are absent. While time irreversibility is a fundamental property of a living system, the state of death is more time reversible by means of energy flow across the system's boundaries. Thus a critical state of a system can be estimated by applying natural time analysis upon calculating the entropy upon both normal time flow and time reversal and studying the difference of two results.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":0\" />[[File:Natural time as applied in cardiology.jpg|thumb|(a) [[Electrocardiography|ECG]] in which the RR distances are marked<br />\n(b) the same ECG plotted in (a) but read in natural time analysis<br />\n(c) ECG at conventional time upon time reversal<br />\n(d) ECG upon time reversal in natural time analysis<br />\nThe length between RR distances in conventional time is aproximately considered as the energy of each pulse (event) in natural time analysis.|400px|alt=|center]]\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Seismology ===\n\n==== Earthquake nowcasting ====\nIn seismology, nowcasting is the estimate of the current dynamic state of a seismological system.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> It differs from forecasting which aims to estimate the probability of a future event<ref name=\":5\" /> but it is also considered a potential base for forecasting.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Nowcasting is based on the [[earthquake cycle]] model, a recurring cycle between pairs of large earthquakes in a geographical area, upon which the system is evaluated using natural time analysis.<ref name=\":1\" /> Nowcasting calculations produce the \"earthquake potential score\", an estimation of the current level of seismic progress.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nWhen applied to seismicity, natural time analysis has the following advantages:<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n# Declustering of the aftershocks is not necessary as natural time count is evenly valid in any case of aftershock or backgroung seismicity.\n# Natural time statistics do not depend on the level of seismicity, given that the [[Gutenberg\u2013Richter law|b value]] does not significantly vary.\n\nTypical applications are: great global earthquakes and tsunamis,<ref name=\":6\" /> aftershocks and induced seismicity,<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> induced seismicity at gas fields,<ref name=\":7\" /> seismic risk to global megacities,<ref name=\":5\" /> studying of clustering of large global earthquakes,<ref name=\":8\" /> etc.\n\n==== Earthquake prediction ====\nNatural time analysis has been initially applied to [[VAN method]] in order to improve the accuracy of the estimation of the time of a forthcoming earthquake that has been indicated to occur by seismic eletric signals (SES). The method deems SES valid when \u03ba<sub>1</sub> = 0.070. Once the SES are deemed valid, a second NT analysis is started in which the subsequent seismic (rather than electric) events are noted, and the region is divided up as a [[Venn diagram]] with at least two seismic events per overlapping rectangle. When \u03ba<sub>1</sub> approaches the value \u03ba<sub>1</sub> = 0.070 for the candidate region, a critical seismic event is considered imminent, i.e. it will occur in a few days to one week or so.<ref>Varotsos, Sarlis & Skordas 2011 (book), chapter 7</ref>\n\n=== Cardiology ===\nNatural time analysis has been experimentally used for the diagnosis of [[heart failure]] syndrome<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> as well as identifying patients at high risk for [[sudden cardiac death]],<ref name=\":10\" /> even when measuring solely the heart rate, either using far more inexpensive and portable equipment (i.e. [[Pulse oximeter|oximeter]]) or [[electrocardiography]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Economy ===\nDue to similarities of the dynamic characteristics between earthquakes and financial markets, natural time analysis, which is primirily used in seismology, was chosen to assist in developing winning strategies in financial markets, with encouraging results.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n*{{Cite book\n |last1 = Varotsos |first1 = Panayiotis A.\n |last2 = Sarlis   |first2 = Nicholas V.\n |last3 = Skordas  |first3 = Efthimios S.\n |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/755081829\n |title=Natural time analysis : the new view of time ; Precursory seismic electric signals, earthquakes and other complex time series\n |date=2011\n |publisher=Springer\n |isbn=978-3-642-16449-1\n |location=Berlin\n |oclc=755081829\n}}\n\n[[Category:Statistical analysis]]\n", "name_user": "ManosHacker", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEtymology", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_time_analysis"}

{"title_page": "Springside, Ayrshire", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\nThe village of '''Springside''' is in [[North Ayrshire]], Parish of [[Dreghorn]], [[Scotland]]. It is three miles from [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]], {{convert|1+1/2|mi|km}} west of Crosshouse and four miles from [[Kilmarnock]]. In the 18th, 19th and mid-20th centuries, the locality was a highly industrialised [[coal mining]] district. The settlement is on the [[Lambroughton|Garrier Burn]], which forms the boundary with [[East Ayrshire]]. Springside had a population of around 1364 in 1991. The [[A71 road|A71]] now bypasses the village, {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} to the south.\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Introduction==\n[[Image:Springhillinstitute.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The old Springhill Institute and library, now the Springside Community Centre]]\nSpringside (NS370386) lies on the old main road from Irvine to Kilmarnock, with a junction for [[Cunninghamhead]] and [[Stewarton]] district. A minor road branches off for Busbiehill and [[Knockentiber]]. A [[milestone]] stood near the small shop at the junction of the road leading up to the primary school.\n\n==History==\nThe entire parish of Dreghorn belonged in the 12th century to the De Morvilles,<ref name=\"Groome\">[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/ Frances Groome, Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland  (1882\u20134)]</ref> Lord High Constables of Scotland, from whom it passed in 1196 to Roland, Lord of Galloway. The name Kirkland is marked on [[Timothy Pont]]'s map of 1604<ref name=\"Pont\">[[Pont, Timothy]] (1604). ''Cuninghamia.'' Pub. Blaeu in 1654.</ref> and on Armstrong's map of 1775, showing its antiquity.<ref name=\"Armstrong\">Armstrong and Son. Engraved by S. Pyle (1775). A New Map of Ayr Shire comprehending Kyle, Cunningham and Carrick.</ref> 1775 map. The name infers church ownership, possibly through a feudal grant of land by a local baron in pre-reformation times.\n\nPart of the reason for the development of Springside was to cater for travellers on the roads, with the Croft Inn being built by the Bankhead family from [[Northern Ireland]] in the 17th century to cater for the stagecoach routes from Kilmarnock to Irvine and Stewarton to Troon. This survives as Scott's Corner (2007).<ref name=\"Springside\">Springside's ''Auld Lang Syne'' (2002). Springside Women's Health Group. P. 2.</ref> The Bankhead area of Springside is named after them, indeed Bankhead was the main name for the area until the [[Royal Mail]] reorganised its postal districts in the 1930s and at that point many hamlets and other localities ceased to exist officially, such as Springhill, Corsehill, and Kirklands.<ref name=\"Springside\"/><ref name=\"Strawhorn\">[[John Strawhorn|Strawhorn, John]] and Boyd, William (1951). The Third Statistical Account of Scotland. Ayrshire. Pub. Edinburgh.</ref> The eastern area of the present Springside was called Bankhead up until at least the 1921\u20131928 OS, the hamlet of Springside being originally clustered around [[Springside railway station]] with its Springside and Kirkland miners rows.\n\nThe earliest recording of the Bankhead surname is from 1527 in Riccarton parish, and there are many references to the family in [[Kilmaurs]] / [[Kilwinning]] / [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]] in the 16th and 17th centuries. The Bankends seem to have spread originally from Ayrshire to Northern Ireland in the 17th and 18th centuries, with some most likely returning in the 19th century. Documents in the National Archives showing the Springside \"lands of Bankhead\" date back at least as far as 1512. Bankhead is, of course, an exceedingly common Scottish placename in its purely descriptive context; however, it is a most uncommon surname.\n\n[[Laigh Milton viaduct]] over the River Irvine is situated nearby. This is the oldest railway viaduct in Scotland<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.east-ayrshire.gov.uk/comser/tourism/transport.asp|title=The Official Site of Scotland's National Tourist Board|access-date=21 March 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503002721/http://www.east-ayrshire.gov.uk/comser/tourism/transport.asp|archive-date=3 May 2007}}</ref> and one of the oldest in the world.<ref>\n{{Cite web|url=http://guide.visitscotland.com/vs/guide/5,en,SCH1/objectId,SIG49645Svs,curr,GBP,season,at1,selectedEntry,home/home.html|title=The Official Site of Scotland's National Tourist Board|access-date=21 March 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829210938/http://guide.visitscotland.com/vs/guide/5,en,SCH1/objectId,SIG49645Svs,curr,GBP,season,at1,selectedEntry,home/home.html|archive-date=29 August 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe old schoolhouse still stands at the Overtoun end of the village, the new primary school being opened in 1979. In the last few years (2006\u20132007), much of the council housing on the main road near the Croft Inn has been demolished and private housing built. The tranquil rural surroundings of 2007 totally belie the industrial past of the area.\n\n===Thorntoun Estate===\n\nSpringside was close to several country estates which provided employment and contributed to the need for the establishment of rural settlements such as Springside. [[Thorntoun house and estate]], including Carmel Bank, previously another Cuninghame property lies just up the Thorntoun Brae towards Crosshouse. It was home to various families, such as the Montgomerys, Rosses, Mures, Cuninghames, Peebles, Wreys and Sturrocks, before becoming a school, opened by [[Barnardo's]] in September 1971 for children with emotional difficulties aged 11 to 16 years. The school closed in 1990 and Thorntoun finally became a nursing home. The house itself was demolished shortly after the Second World War and a new building constructed.\n\n===Warwickhill Estate===\n\nWarwickhill estate was situated towards the Overtoun Miners' Row. Farms with the name Warwickdale and Warwickhill are still extant, 'Warrix'<ref name=\"Dobie\">Dobie, James D. (ed Dobie, J.S.) (1876). ''Cunninghame, Topographized by Timothy Pont'' 1604\u20131608, with continuations and illustrative notices. Pub. John Tweed, Glasgow.</ref> being the origin of this otherwise seemingly very English-sounding name.\n\n[[Image:Warwickdale.jpg|thumb|200px|A view of the Meadow Wood and Warwickdale Farm in 2006]]\nWarrix (now Warrick) Hill also formed part of the demesne of the De Morvilles who forfeited their lands to [[Robert the Bruce]]. Sir James, son of Sir James Stewart of Bonkill, son of Alexander the [[High Steward of Scotland]], obtained Peirstoun ([[Perceton]]) and Warrixhill, and his son, also Sir James, in turn inherited. This son had only a daughter as heir and she married Sir William Douglas and thus the property passed by marriage to the Barclay's of Pierstoun. Warrixhill became divided into two and the Montgomeries of [[Bourtreehill]] held one half whilst the Cunninghamhead family obtained the other.\n\nIn 1524 William Cuninghame inherited the lands from his father John and both parts were sold to John Edmeston, Minister of [[Cardross, Argyll and Bute|Cardross]], whose son John sold them to Jonathan Anderson, a [[Glasgow]] Merchant. William Henry Ralston, a cadet of the Ralstons of that Ilk purchased them in 1790 from John, son of Jonathan Edmeston. A nephew, Alexander MacDougal Ralston inherited in 1833. Margaret Fullarton was the wife of Alexander McDougall Ralston. They were buried in Dreghorn parish churchyard. The three sections of Peirstoun were known as Pierstoun-Barclay, Pierstoun-Blair and Pierstoun-Cunninghame. This latter portion is thought to have contained Warrickhill itself.\n\nJohn Muir of Warwick Mains died in 1875. He was a private in the Ayrshire Yeomanry Cavalry and was accidentally killed by his horse. He was buried in Dreghorn Parish Churchyard.\n\n===The Craig Estate===\n\nThe Craig estate of the Dunlop family and later the Pollok-Morris family lies within the ancient Barony of Robertoun, situated above Laigh Milton Mill and leading down to the River Irvine. The original house was located in what was later to become the walled garden. The present Craig House, further up the hill, dates from c1780 and was enlarged c1835 and a portico and [[Perron (staircase)|perron]] added by Kilmarnock architect James Ingram.<ref name=sa204>http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/building_full.php?id=204934</ref> The building was further enlarged in 1882 by architect Allan Stevenson with the west wing and in 1902 with the addition of the Winter Garden designed by architect Sir [[John James Burnet]].<ref name=sa204/> The Pollok Morris family sold the house after WWII to Glasgow Corporation for use as a residential school or 'respite home' for Glasgow boys and later girls.<ref name=\"Strawhorn, John & Boyd, William\">Strawhorn, John and Boyd, William (1951). The Third Statistical Account of Scotland. Ayrshire. Pub. P. 475</ref> After the school closed in the 1980s the house was vandalised and eventually burnt out with the loss of all the interiors and the portico which had collapsed. It remained a roofless ruin before being acquired by a developer who along with an enabling development of houses in the policies rebuilt the house and reinstated the portico. The interior was not restored but was converted into flats in 2006.\n\n===The collieries, coal pits and tileworks===\n\nThe 1860, 1898\u20131904 and, 1911 and 1912 OS maps all show that the extent to which Springside was surrounded by [[collieries]], [[coal pit]]s and freight only railway or 'tram' lines. Collieries were located near Cauldhame farm (Cauldhame and Springhill (Pit No.4), Bankhead (one called West Thorntoun), Springhill (Pit No.1) and Springhill (Pit No.2) at Springhill, and another between Busbiehill and Warwickhill. These were all served by [[standard gauge]] mineral railway lines, criss-crossing the countryside; they all now lifted, with only a few embankments left to indicate their original course. In 1860 numerous old and current coal pits dotted the area. The waste bing of Springhill (Pit No.3) still lies close to Springside in the field that may have been the Thorntoun deer park. Muirside pit was situated near to the Kirkland miners' row. The access track from Overtoun road is still in use today and is known as the 'pit road'.\n\nThe Corsehill tileworks made tiles for drainage and the excavation of clay lead to the creation of several large ponds. Swans nested on an islet in one of these ponds and a local football team from the area was called \"The Swans\".<ref name=\"Springside\"/> Some of the flooded claypits remain as part of a walkway and community woodland.\n\n===Miner's rows===\n\nSpringside had many, built by the mine owners for their workers. Corsehill, Sprigside and Bankhead were constructed by J & R. Howie, Archibald Finnie & Sons and A. Kenneth & Sons. Others rows were at nearby [[Cunninghamhead, Perceton and Annick Lodge|Overtoun]], also Warwickhill row, and Kirkland row.\n\n===The railway===\n\n[[Image:Springsidestation.jpg|left|250px|thumb|The station looking towards Dreghorn in the 19th century]]\n[[Springside railway station]] or Halt opened in 1890,<ref name=\"Wham\">Wham, A.

''The Directory of Railway Stations''. Patrick Stephens Ltd, Sparkford. {{ISBN|1-85260-508-1}}.</ref> The station never had any freight facilities and trains ran from Kilmarnock to Ardrossan where they connected with Clyde coast steamer services to Arran and Millport. The route had ten return journeys a day in its last timetable before closure.<ref name=\"Stansfield\">Stansfield, Gordon (1999), ''Ayrshire & Renfrewshire's Lost Railways.'' Pub. Stenlake, Ochiltree. {{ISBN|1-84033-077-5}}. P. 26.</ref> The railway went under the road, however the cutting has been infilled and the whole line from [[Crosshouse railway station]] and Busbie junction to Irvine is now a [[Sustrans]] cycle path and walkway.\n\n===The turnpike===\n\nSpringside was on a toll road or turnpike. The name 'turnpike' originated from the original 'gate' used being just a simple wooden bar attached at one end to a hinge on the supporting post. The hinge allowed it to 'open' or 'turn' This bar looked like the 'pike' used as a weapon in the army at that time and therefore we get 'turnpike'.\n\nThe term was also used by the military for barriers set up on roads specifically to prevent the passage of horses.\n\nIn addition to providing better surfaces and more direct routes, the turnpikes settled the confusion of the different lengths given to miles,<ref name=\"Thomson\">Thomson, John (1828). A Map of the Northern Part of Ayrshire.</ref> which varied from 4,854 to nearly 7,000 feet. Long miles, short miles, Scotch or Scot's miles (5,928 feet), Irish miles (6,720 feet), etc. all existed. 5,280 feet seems to have been an average. Another important point is that when these new toll roads were constructed the [[turnpike trust]]s went to a great deal of trouble to improve the route of the new road and these changes could be quite considerable as the old roads tended to go from farm to farm, hardly the shortest route. The tolls on roads were abolished in 1878 to be replaced by a road 'assessment', which was taken over by the county council in 1889.\n\n===Farms===\n\nSpringhill farm no longer exists,<ref name=\"Springside\"/> being situated where the main road houses are now. Springside farm is still surrounded by open fields and the well established Kirkland farm is just across the Garrier Burn on the road to Busbiehill.\n\n===Springside primary school===\n\nThe local primary school was threatened with closure by North Ayrshire Council in 2008 and staff, pupils, parents and local people launched a vigorous campaign to save it. The campaign was featured on national television, local press, etc.\n\n==Micro history==\nThe County Council in 1932 planned to demolish most of the old miners' rows, and this was largely carried out, with new housing erected.<ref name=\"Strawhorn, John & Boyd, William\"/>\n\nAt the foot of Thorntoun Brae, just before the Garrier Burn on the right looking towards Thorntoun, was the site of the curling pond.\n{|style=\"float:left; margin:1em 1em 1em 1em; width:27em; border: 1px solid #a0a0a0; padding: 10px; background-color: #F5F5F5; text-align:left;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|'''Etymology'''\n|- style=\"text-align:left; font-size:x-medium;\"\n|The Garrier's name is thought to be derived, according to McNaught,<ref name=\"McNaught\">*McNaught, Duncan (1912).

It is three miles from [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]], {{convert|1+1/2|mi|km}} west of Crosshouse and four miles from [[Kilmarnock]]. In the 18th, 19th and mid-20th centuries, the locality was a highly industrialised [[coal mining]] district. The settlement is on the [[Lambroughton|Garrier Burn]], which forms the boundary with [[East Ayrshire]]. Springside had a population of around 1364 in 1991. The [[A71 road|A71]] now bypasses the village, {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} to the south.\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Introduction==\n[[Image:Springhillinstitute.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The old Springhill Institute and library, now the Springside Community Centre]]\nSpringside (NS370386) lies on the old main road from Irvine to Kilmarnock, with a junction for [[Cunninghamhead]] and [[Stewarton]] district. A minor road branches off for Busbiehill and [[Knockentiber]]. A [[milestone]] stood near the small shop at the junction of the road leading up to the primary school.\n\n==History==\nThe entire parish of Dreghorn belonged in the 12th century to the De Morvilles,<ref name=\"Groome\">[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/ Frances Groome, Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland  (1882\u20134)]</ref> Lord High Constables of Scotland, from whom it passed in 1196 to Roland, Lord of Galloway. The name Kirkland is marked on [[Timothy Pont]]'s map of 1604<ref name=\"Pont\">[[Pont, Timothy]] (1604). ''Cuninghamia.'' Pub. Blaeu in 1654.</ref> and on Armstrong's map of 1775, showing its antiquity.<ref name=\"Armstrong\">Armstrong and Son. Engraved by S. Pyle (1775). A New Map of Ayr Shire comprehending Kyle, Cunningham and Carrick.</ref> 1775 map. The name infers church ownership, possibly through a feudal grant of land by a local baron in pre-reformation times.\n\nPart of the reason for the development of Springside was to cater for travellers on the roads, with the Croft Inn being built by the Bankhead family from [[Northern Ireland]] in the 17th century to cater for the stagecoach routes from Kilmarnock to Irvine and Stewarton to Troon. This survives as Scott's Corner (2007).<ref name=\"Springside\">Springside's ''Auld Lang Syne'' (2002). Springside Women's Health Group. P. 2.</ref> The Bankhead area of Springside is named after them, indeed Bankhead was the main name for the area until the [[Royal Mail]] reorganised its postal districts in the 1930s and at that point many hamlets and other localities ceased to exist officially, such as Springhill, Corsehill, and Kirklands.<ref name=\"Springside\"/><ref name=\"Strawhorn\">[[John Strawhorn|Strawhorn, John]] and Boyd, William (1951). The Third Statistical Account of Scotland. Ayrshire. Pub. Edinburgh.</ref> The eastern area of the present Springside was called Bankhead up until at least the 1921\u20131928 OS, the hamlet of Springside being originally clustered around [[Springside railway station]] with its Springside and Kirkland miners rows.\n\nThe earliest recording of the Bankhead surname is from 1527 in Riccarton parish, and there are many references to the family in [[Kilmaurs]] / [[Kilwinning]] / [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]] in the 16th and 17th centuries. The Bankends seem to have spread originally from Ayrshire to Northern Ireland in the 17th and 18th centuries, with some most likely returning in the 19th century. Documents in the National Archives showing the Springside \"lands of Bankhead\" date back at least as far as 1512. Bankhead is, of course, an exceedingly common Scottish placename in its purely descriptive context; however, it is a most uncommon surname.\n\n[[Laigh Milton viaduct]] over the River Irvine is situated nearby. This is the oldest railway viaduct in Scotland<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.east-ayrshire.gov.uk/comser/tourism/transport.asp|title=The Official Site of Scotland's National Tourist Board|access-date=21 March 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503002721/http://www.east-ayrshire.gov.uk/comser/tourism/transport.asp|archive-date=3 May 2007}}</ref> and one of the oldest in the world.<ref>\n{{Cite web|url=http://guide.visitscotland.com/vs/guide/5,en,SCH1/objectId,SIG49645Svs,curr,GBP,season,at1,selectedEntry,home/home.html|title=The Official Site of Scotland's National Tourist Board|access-date=21 March 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829210938/http://guide.visitscotland.com/vs/guide/5,en,SCH1/objectId,SIG49645Svs,curr,GBP,season,at1,selectedEntry,home/home.html|archive-date=29 August 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe old schoolhouse still stands at the Overtoun end of the village, the new primary school being opened in 1979. In the last few years (2006\u20132007), much of the council housing on the main road near the Croft Inn has been demolished and private housing built. The tranquil rural surroundings of 2007 totally belie the industrial past of the area.\n\n===Thorntoun Estate===\n\nSpringside was close to several country estates which provided employment and contributed to the need for the establishment of rural settlements such as Springside. [[Thorntoun house and estate]], including Carmel Bank, previously another Cuninghame property lies just up the Thorntoun Brae towards Crosshouse. It was home to various families, such as the Montgomerys, Rosses, Mures, Cuninghames, Peebles, Wreys and Sturrocks, before becoming a school, opened by [[Barnardo's]] in September 1971 for children with emotional difficulties aged 11 to 16 years. The school closed in 1990 and Thorntoun finally became a nursing home. The house itself was demolished shortly after the Second World War and a new building constructed.\n\n===Warwickhill Estate===\n\nWarwickhill estate was situated towards the Overtoun Miners' Row. Farms with the name Warwickdale and Warwickhill are still extant, 'Warrix'<ref name=\"Dobie\">Dobie, James D. (ed Dobie, J.S.) (1876). ''Cunninghame, Topographized by Timothy Pont'' 1604\u20131608, with continuations and illustrative notices. Pub. John Tweed, Glasgow.</ref> being the origin of this otherwise seemingly very English-sounding name.\n\n[[Image:Warwickdale.jpg|thumb|200px|A view of the Meadow Wood and Warwickdale Farm in 2006]]\nWarrix (now Warrick) Hill also formed part of the demesne of the De Morvilles who forfeited their lands to [[Robert the Bruce]]. Sir James, son of Sir James Stewart of Bonkill, son of Alexander the [[High Steward of Scotland]], obtained Peirstoun ([[Perceton]]) and Warrixhill, and his son, also Sir James, in turn inherited. This son had only a daughter as heir and she married Sir William Douglas and thus the property passed by marriage to the Barclay's of Pierstoun. Warrixhill became divided into two and the Montgomeries of [[Bourtreehill]] held one half whilst the Cunninghamhead family obtained the other.\n\nIn 1524 William Cuninghame inherited the lands from his father John and both parts were sold to John Edmeston, Minister of [[Cardross, Argyll and Bute|Cardross]], whose son John sold them to Jonathan Anderson, a [[Glasgow]] Merchant. William Henry Ralston, a cadet of the Ralstons of that Ilk purchased them in 1790 from John, son of Jonathan Edmeston. A nephew, Alexander MacDougal Ralston inherited in 1833. Margaret Fullarton was the wife of Alexander McDougall Ralston. They were buried in Dreghorn parish churchyard. The three sections of Peirstoun were known as Pierstoun-Barclay, Pierstoun-Blair and Pierstoun-Cunninghame. This latter portion is thought to have contained Warrickhill itself.\n\nJohn Muir of Warwick Mains died in 1875. He was a private in the Ayrshire Yeomanry Cavalry and was accidentally killed by his horse. He was buried in Dreghorn Parish Churchyard.\n\n===The Craig Estate===\n\nThe Craig estate of the Dunlop family and later the Pollok-Morris family lies within the ancient Barony of Robertoun, situated above Laigh Milton Mill and leading down to the River Irvine. The original house was located in what was later to become the walled garden. The present Craig House, further up the hill, dates from c1780 and was enlarged c1835 and a portico and [[Perron (staircase)|perron]] added by Kilmarnock architect James Ingram.<ref name=sa204>http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/building_full.php?id=204934</ref> The building was further enlarged in 1882 by architect Allan Stevenson with the west wing and in 1902 with the addition of the Winter Garden designed by architect Sir [[John James Burnet]].<ref name=sa204/> The Pollok Morris family sold the house after WWII to Glasgow Corporation for use as a residential school or 'respite home' for Glasgow boys and later girls.<ref name=\"Strawhorn, John & Boyd, William\">Strawhorn, John and Boyd, William (1951). The Third Statistical Account of Scotland. Ayrshire. Pub. P. 475</ref> After the school closed in the 1980s the house was vandalised and eventually burnt out with the loss of all the interiors and the portico which had collapsed. It remained a roofless ruin before being acquired by a developer who along with an enabling development of houses in the policies rebuilt the house and reinstated the portico. The interior was not restored but was converted into flats in 2006.\n\n===The collieries, coal pits and tileworks===\n\nThe 1860, 1898\u20131904 and, 1911 and 1912 OS maps all show that the extent to which Springside was surrounded by [[collieries]], [[coal pit]]s and freight only railway or 'tram' lines. Collieries were located near Cauldhame farm (Cauldhame and Springhill (Pit No.4), Bankhead (one called West Thorntoun), Springhill (Pit No.1) and Springhill (Pit No.2) at Springhill, and another between Busbiehill and Warwickhill. These were all served by [[standard gauge]] mineral railway lines, criss-crossing the countryside; they all now lifted, with only a few embankments left to indicate their original course. In 1860 numerous old and current coal pits dotted the area. The waste bing of Springhill (Pit No.3) still lies close to Springside in the field that may have been the Thorntoun deer park. Muirside pit was situated near to the Kirkland miners' row. The access track from Overtoun road is still in use today and is known as the 'pit road'.\n\nThe Corsehill tileworks made tiles for drainage and the excavation of clay lead to the creation of several large ponds. Swans nested on an islet in one of these ponds and a local football team from the area was called \"The Swans\".<ref name=\"Springside\"/> Some of the flooded claypits remain as part of a walkway and community woodland.\n\n===Miner's rows===\n\nSpringside had many, built by the mine owners for their workers. Corsehill, Sprigside and Bankhead were constructed by J & R. Howie, Archibald Finnie & Sons and A. Kenneth & Sons. Others rows were at nearby [[Cunninghamhead, Perceton and Annick Lodge|Overtoun]], also Warwickhill row, and Kirkland row.\n\n===The railway===\n\n[[Image:Springsidestation.jpg|left|250px|thumb|The station looking towards Dreghorn in the 19th century]]\n[[Springside railway station]] or Halt opened in 1890,<ref name=\"Wham\">Wham, A. (1997). ''The Lost Railways of Ayrshire''. G.C. Book Publishers Ltd, Wigtown. {{ISBN|1-872350-27-5}}.</ref> and closed permanently to passengers on 6 April 1964.<ref name=\"Springside\"/><ref name=\"Butt\">Butt, R. V. J. (1995). ''The Directory of Railway Stations''. Patrick Stephens Ltd, Sparkford. {{ISBN|1-85260-508-1}}.</ref> The station never had any freight facilities and trains ran from Kilmarnock to Ardrossan where they connected with Clyde coast steamer services to Arran and Millport. The route had ten return journeys a day in its last timetable before closure.<ref name=\"Stansfield\">Stansfield, Gordon (1999), ''Ayrshire & Renfrewshire's Lost Railways.'' Pub. Stenlake, Ochiltree. {{ISBN|1-84033-077-5}}. P. 26.</ref> The railway went under the road, however the cutting has been infilled and the whole line from [[Crosshouse railway station]] and Busbie junction to Irvine is now a [[Sustrans]] cycle path and walkway.\n\n===The turnpike===\n\nSpringside was on a toll road or turnpike. The name 'turnpike' originated from the original 'gate' used being just a simple wooden bar attached at one end to a hinge on the supporting post. The hinge allowed it to 'open' or 'turn' This bar looked like the 'pike' used as a weapon in the army at that time and therefore we get 'turnpike'.\n\nThe term was also used by the military for barriers set up on roads specifically to prevent the passage of horses.\n\nIn addition to providing better surfaces and more direct routes, the turnpikes settled the confusion of the different lengths given to miles,<ref name=\"Thomson\">Thomson, John (1828). A Map of the Northern Part of Ayrshire.</ref> which varied from 4,854 to nearly 7,000 feet. Long miles, short miles, Scotch or Scot's miles (5,928 feet), Irish miles (6,720 feet), etc. all existed. 5,280 feet seems to have been an average. Another important point is that when these new toll roads were constructed the [[turnpike trust]]s went to a great deal of trouble to improve the route of the new road and these changes could be quite considerable as the old roads tended to go from farm to farm, hardly the shortest route. The tolls on roads were abolished in 1878 to be replaced by a road 'assessment', which was taken over by the county council in 1889.\n\n===Farms===\n\nSpringhill farm no longer exists,<ref name=\"Springside\"/> being situated where the main road houses are now. Springside farm is still surrounded by open fields and the well established Kirkland farm is just across the Garrier Burn on the road to Busbiehill.\n\n===Springside primary school===\n\nThe local primary school was threatened with closure by North Ayrshire Council in 2008 and staff, pupils, parents and local people launched a vigorous campaign to save it. The campaign was featured on national television, local press, etc.\n\n==Micro history==\nThe County Council in 1932 planned to demolish most of the old miners' rows, and this was largely carried out, with new housing erected.<ref name=\"Strawhorn, John & Boyd, William\"/>\n\nAt the foot of Thorntoun Brae, just before the Garrier Burn on the right looking towards Thorntoun, was the site of the curling pond.\n{|style=\"float:left; margin:1em 1em 1em 1em; width:27em; border: 1px solid #a0a0a0; padding: 10px; background-color: #F5F5F5; text-align:left;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|'''Etymology'''\n|- style=\"text-align:left; font-size:x-medium;\"\n|The Garrier's name is thought to be derived, according to McNaught,<ref name=\"McNaught\">*McNaught, Duncan (1912).

According to Wirth, Christ descended from a lost tribe of the original Aryans, who had left their traces in the Near East in the form of [[Megalithic monument]]s.\n\nChristianity, however, was corrupted by oriental despotism and local superstition, and came back to the Northern Europe in a distorted manner. As [[Judaism]] was largely responsible for this distortion, Christianity had to be cleansed from Judaic elements and revert to its original [[Fertility rite|fertility cults]], in which the [[Mother Goddess]] played a central part. Mai 1933 Wirth organized an groundbreaking exhibition in Berlin under the title of ''\"Heilbringer\": From Thule to Galilee and from Galilee to Thule''. Here humanity's religious history was linked to the expectation that [[Adolf Hitler]] would be the Healer and Savior of the German people.\n\nThe ''Palestinabuch'' may have been conceived as a counterpart to the ''Ura Linda Chronicle''. It was officially titled ''The Riddle of the Palestine's Megalithic Graves: From JAU to Jesus''. By 1969 the proposed title had changed into ''Between the North Sea and the [[Sea of Galilee|Sea of Genezareth]]'', implicitly referring to an influential book by the 19th-century reactionary [[Julius Langbehn]], ''Rembrandt as Educator'' (1890).

As soon as Wirth's would apply his symbolic historical methods,\n\n<blockquote>[...] there is no line, not a word in the Old Testament that would not succumb to such Hyperborean deconstruction. It is not a question of criticizing the text [...]. What Wirth did was resacralize, reveal the original, Hyperborean gnosis - the true foundation of the Old Testament tradition, free it from biased interpretative models. [...] You can imagine what kind of work it was. Unfortunately, now we can only guess about its contents. [...] Already in the 70s, when Wirth almost finished writing it, the only completed edition disappeared without a trace. In the scientist's absence, unknown people entered the house, turned everything upside down, but only took the ''Palestina Buch''. Wirth turned to his students (there were two or three unfinished copies), but the mysterious strangers had also visited them. [...] If one only could get fragments of the ''Palestina Buch''...

It was located to the north of the village of [[Branston, Leicestershire|Branston]] in [[Leicestershire]] on the edge of the [[Belvoir Castle|Belvoir Estate]]. The tramway operated from 1884 until 1958.\n\n== History ==\nThe Waltham Iron Ore Company was formed in 1882 to work ironstone from fields near the village of [[Waltham on the Wolds]]. It was a subsidiary of the Staveley Coal and Iron Company. The company worked these fields for less than two years, before the deposits were exhausted. They then leased further fields near the village of Branston and began extracting ore there, starting in either 1884 or 1885.<ref name=Quine>{{Quine ironstone |part=1}}</ref>\n\nThe first pits worked were Green Lane and Long Hole. These were served by a network of metre gauge tramways which were moved as the working faces progressed. They connected to the northern terminus of the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]]'s [[Eaton Branch Railway]], which tipplers allowed unloading of the [[narrow gauge]] ore wagons into [[standard gauge]] trucks. In 1913, a new pit was opened to the east of Long Hole, called Bolton's Pit. This was reached by a longer branch of the tramway.<ref name=Tonks>{{Tonks ironstone |part=9}}</ref>\n\nThe original Long Hole and Green Lane quarries were exhausted by 1920. The company extended the branch to Bolton's pit to the south east to open up the new Reservoir pit, which was on the western shore of [[Knipton Reservoir]]. Reservoir pit continued in use until 1937. The [[Second World War]] saw a sharp rise in demand for iron and steel. This was followed by a steady decline in the years after the war, as cheap imported steel entered the British market. In 1949 further new sources of ironstone were needed and land was leased on the edge of the [[Belvoir Castle]] estate. A new tramway branch was laid to reach the High Leys pit. In 1951, High Leys was worked out, and the branch was extended to the new Granby pit. This was similarly abandoned in 1955 and the final extension of the branch was made to Harts pit.\n\nHarts was the last ironstone pit worked by the Waltham Iron Ore Tramway. It closed in 1958, and with it the tramway was shut down. The line was lifted in 1959, with just a few sidings by the locomotive sheds at the southern end of the tramway left.
