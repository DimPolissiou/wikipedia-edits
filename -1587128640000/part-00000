Its name is Latin for \"the smaller lion\", in contrast to [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]], the larger lion. It lies between the larger and more recognizable [[Ursa Major]] to the north and Leo to the south. Leo Minor was not regarded as a separate constellation by classical [[Astronomy|astronomers]]; it was designated by [[Johannes Hevelius]] in 1687.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=168\u201369}}\n\nThere are 37 stars brighter than [[apparent magnitude]]&nbsp;6.5 in the constellation; three are brighter than magnitude&nbsp;4.5. [[46&nbsp;Leonis Minoris]], an orange [[giant star|giant]] of magnitude&nbsp;3.8, is located some 95&nbsp;[[light-year]]s from Earth. At magnitude&nbsp;4.4, [[Beta Leonis Minoris]] is the second-brightest star and the only one in the constellation with a [[Bayer designation]]. It is a [[binary star]], the brighter component of which is an orange giant and the fainter a yellow-white [[main sequence]] star. The third-brightest star is [[21&nbsp;Leonis Minoris]], a rapidly rotating [[A-type main-sequence star|white main-sequence star]] of average magnitude&nbsp;4.5. The constellation also includes two stars with [[planetary system]]s, two pairs of [[interacting galaxies]], and the unique [[deep-sky object]] [[Hanny's Voorwerp]].\n\n==History==\nThe classical astronomers [[Aratus]] and [[Ptolemy]] had noted the region of what is now Leo Minor to be undefined and not containing any distinctive pattern; Ptolemy classified the stars in this area as ''amorph\u014dtoi'' (not belonging to a constellation outline) within the constellation Leo.{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=263}}\n\n[[Johannes Hevelius]] first depicted Leo Minor in 1687 when he outlined ten new constellations in his star atlas ''Firmamentum Sobiescianum'',{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Filling the remaining gaps}} and included 18 of its objects in the accompanying ''Catalogus Stellarum Fixarum''.{{sfn|Hevelius|1687|pp=214\u201315}} Hevelius decided upon Leo Minor or Leo Junior as a depiction that would align with its beastly neighbours the Lion and the Great Bear.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=189\u201390}} In 1845, English astronomer [[Francis Baily]] revised the catalogue of Hevelius's new constellations, and assigned a Greek letter known as [[Bayer designation]] to stars brighter than [[apparent magnitude]] 4.5.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=8}} [[Richard A. Proctor]] gave the constellation the name ''Leaena'' \"the Lioness\" in 1870,{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=263}} explaining that he sought to shorten the constellation names to make them more manageable on celestial charts.{{sfn|Proctor|1870|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nGerman astronomer [[Christian Ludwig Ideler]] posited that the stars of Leo Minor had been termed ''Al Thib\u0101' wa-Aul\u0101duh\u0101'' \"Gazelle with her Young\" on a 13th-century Arabic celestial globe, recovered by Cardinal [[Stefano Borgia]] and housed in the prelate's museum at [[Velletri]].{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=42}}<ref>See also Mark R.

The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is \"LMi\".{{sfn|Russell|1922|p=469}} The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eug\u00e8ne Joseph Delporte|Eug\u00e8ne Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 16&nbsp;[[Edge (geometry)|sides]]. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|9|22.4}} and {{RA|11|06.5}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between 22.84\u00b0 and 41.43\u00b0.{{sfn|IAU, ''The Constellations'', Leo Minor}} Ranked 64th out of 88 constellations in size, Leo Minor covers an area of 232.0&nbsp;square degrees, or 0.562&nbsp;percent of the sky.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Constellations \u2013 part two}} It [[Culmination|culminates]] each year at midnight on 24 February,{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=290}} and at 9 p.m. on 24 May.{{sfn|The Constellations : Part 2 Culmination Times}}\n\n==Notable features==\n\n===Stars===\n{{see also|List of stars in Leo Minor}}\nThere are only three [[star]]s in the constellation brighter than magnitude 4.5,{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=189\u201390}} and 37&nbsp;stars with a magnitude brighter than 6.5.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Constellations \u2013 part two}} Leo Minor does not have a star designated Alpha because Baily erred and allocated a Greek letter to only one star, Beta.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=168\u201369}} It is unclear whether he intended to give [[46&nbsp;Leonis Minoris]] a Bayer designation, as he recognized Beta and 46&nbsp;Leonis Minoris as of the appropriate brightness in his catalogue. He died before revising his proofs, which might explain this star's omission.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=189\u201390}}\n\nAt magnitude 3.8, the brightest star in Leo Minor is an orange [[giant star|giant]] of [[Stellar classification|spectral class]] K0III named 46&nbsp;Leonis Minoris or Praecipua;{{sfn|SIMBAD 46 Leonis Minoris}} its colour is evident when seen through binoculars.{{sfn|Moore|2000|p=103}} Situated {{Convert|95|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on|sigfig=2}} from Earth,{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=168\u201369}} it has around 32&nbsp;times the [[luminosity]] and is 8.5&nbsp;times the size of the Sun.{{sfn|Kaler, ''Praecipua''}} It was also catalogued and named as o Leonis Minoris by [[Johann Elert Bode]], which has been misinterpreted as Omicron Leonis Minoris.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=189\u201390}} More confusion occurred with its proper name ''Praecipua'', which appears to have been originally applied to [[37 Leonis Minoris]] in the 1814 ''Palermo Catalogue'' of [[Giuseppe Piazzi]], who mistakenly assessed the latter star as the brighter. This name was later connected by Allen with 46 Leonis Minoris\u2014an error perpetuated by subsequent astronomers.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Leo Minor}} The original \"Praecipua\", 37 Leonis Minoris, has an apparent magnitude of 4.69,{{sfn|SIMBAD 37 Leonis Minoris}} but is a distant yellow [[supergiant]] of spectral type G2.5IIa and absolute magnitude of \u22121.84,{{sfn| Kovtyukh et al.|2010}} around {{Convert|578|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=off|sigfig=3}} distant.{{sfn|SIMBAD 37 Leonis Minoris}}\n\n[[File:LeoMinorCC.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Leo Minor as seen by the naked eye]]\n[[Beta Leonis Minoris]] is a binary star system.

}}\n'''Leo Minor''' is a small and faint [[constellation]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern celestial hemisphere]]. Its name is Latin for \"the smaller lion\", in contrast to [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]], the larger lion. It lies between the larger and more recognizable [[Ursa Major]] to the north and Leo to the south. Leo Minor was not regarded as a separate constellation by classical [[Astronomy|astronomers]]; it was designated by [[Johannes Hevelius]] in 1687.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=168\u201369}}\n\nThere are 37 stars brighter than [[apparent magnitude]]&nbsp;6.5 in the constellation; three are brighter than magnitude&nbsp;4.5. [[46&nbsp;Leonis Minoris]], an orange [[giant star|giant]] of magnitude&nbsp;3.8, is located some 95&nbsp;[[light-year]]s from Earth. At magnitude&nbsp;4.4, [[Beta Leonis Minoris]] is the second-brightest star and the only one in the constellation with a [[Bayer designation]]. It is a [[binary star]], the brighter component of which is an orange giant and the fainter a yellow-white [[main sequence]] star. The third-brightest star is [[21&nbsp;Leonis Minoris]], a rapidly rotating [[A-type main-sequence star|white main-sequence star]] of average magnitude&nbsp;4.5. The constellation also includes two stars with [[planetary system]]s, two pairs of [[interacting galaxies]], and the unique [[deep-sky object]] [[Hanny's Voorwerp]].\n\n==History==\nThe classical astronomers [[Aratus]] and [[Ptolemy]] had noted the region of what is now Leo Minor to be undefined and not containing any distinctive pattern; Ptolemy classified the stars in this area as ''amorph\u014dtoi'' (not belonging to a constellation outline) within the constellation Leo.{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=263}}\n\n[[Johannes Hevelius]] first depicted Leo Minor in 1687 when he outlined ten new constellations in his star atlas ''Firmamentum Sobiescianum'',{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Filling the remaining gaps}} and included 18 of its objects in the accompanying ''Catalogus Stellarum Fixarum''.{{sfn|Hevelius|1687|pp=214\u201315}} Hevelius decided upon Leo Minor or Leo Junior as a depiction that would align with its beastly neighbours the Lion and the Great Bear.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=189\u201390}} In 1845, English astronomer [[Francis Baily]] revised the catalogue of Hevelius's new constellations, and assigned a Greek letter known as [[Bayer designation]] to stars brighter than [[apparent magnitude]] 4.5.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=8}} [[Richard A. Proctor]] gave the constellation the name ''Leaena'' \"the Lioness\" in 1870,{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=263}} explaining that he sought to shorten the constellation names to make them more manageable on celestial charts.{{sfn|Proctor|1870|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nGerman astronomer [[Christian Ludwig Ideler]] posited that the stars of Leo Minor had been termed ''Al Thib\u0101' wa-Aul\u0101duh\u0101'' \"Gazelle with her Young\" on a 13th-century Arabic celestial globe, recovered by Cardinal [[Stefano Borgia]] and housed in the prelate's museum at [[Velletri]].{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=42}}<ref>See also Mark R. Chartrand III (1983) Skyguide: A Field Guide for Amateur Astronomers, p. 158 ({{ISBN|0-307-13667-1}}).</ref>  Arabist [[Friedrich Wilhelm Lach]] describes a different view, noting that they had been seen as ''Al Haud'' \"the Pond\", which the Gazelle jumps into.{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=263}} In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars Beta, 30, 37 and 46 Leonis Minoris made up ''Neiping'', a \"Court of Judge or Mediator\", or ''Shi'' \"Court Eunuch\"{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Leo Minor}} or were combined with stars of the neighbouring Leo to make up a large celestial dragon or State Chariot.{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=263}}<ref>See also Chartrand, at p. 158.</ref>  A line of four stars was known as ''Shaowei''; it represented four Imperial advisors and may have been located in Leo Minor, Leo or adjacent regions.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Leo Minor}}\n\n==Characteristics==\nA dark area of the sky with a triangle of brighter stars just visible to the naked eye in good conditions,{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=290}} Leo Minor has been described by [[Patrick Moore]] as having \"dubious claims to a separate identity\".{{sfn|Moore|2000|p=103}} It is a small constellation bordered by [[Ursa Major]] to the north, [[Lynx (constellation)|Lynx]] to the west, [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]] to the south, and touching the corner of [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]] to the southwest. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is \"LMi\".{{sfn|Russell|1922|p=469}} The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eug\u00e8ne Joseph Delporte|Eug\u00e8ne Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 16&nbsp;[[Edge (geometry)|sides]]. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|9|22.4}} and {{RA|11|06.5}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between 22.84\u00b0 and 41.43\u00b0.{{sfn|IAU, ''The Constellations'', Leo Minor}} Ranked 64th out of 88 constellations in size, Leo Minor covers an area of 232.0&nbsp;square degrees, or 0.562&nbsp;percent of the sky.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Constellations \u2013 part two}} It [[Culmination|culminates]] each year at midnight on 24 February,{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=290}} and at 9 p.m. on 24 May.{{sfn|The Constellations : Part 2 Culmination Times}}\n\n==Notable features==\n\n===Stars===\n{{see also|List of stars in Leo Minor}}\nThere are only three [[star]]s in the constellation brighter than magnitude 4.5,{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=189\u201390}} and 37&nbsp;stars with a magnitude brighter than 6.5.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Constellations \u2013 part two}} Leo Minor does not have a star designated Alpha because Baily erred and allocated a Greek letter to only one star, Beta.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=168\u201369}} It is unclear whether he intended to give [[46&nbsp;Leonis Minoris]] a Bayer designation, as he recognized Beta and 46&nbsp;Leonis Minoris as of the appropriate brightness in his catalogue. He died before revising his proofs, which might explain this star's omission.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=189\u201390}}\n\nAt magnitude 3.8, the brightest star in Leo Minor is an orange [[giant star|giant]] of [[Stellar classification|spectral class]] K0III named 46&nbsp;Leonis Minoris or Praecipua;{{sfn|SIMBAD 46 Leonis Minoris}} its colour is evident when seen through binoculars.{{sfn|Moore|2000|p=103}} Situated {{Convert|95|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on|sigfig=2}} from Earth,{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=168\u201369}} it has around 32&nbsp;times the [[luminosity]] and is 8.5&nbsp;times the size of the Sun.{{sfn|Kaler, ''Praecipua''}} It was also catalogued and named as o Leonis Minoris by [[Johann Elert Bode]], which has been misinterpreted as Omicron Leonis Minoris.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=189\u201390}} More confusion occurred with its proper name ''Praecipua'', which appears to have been originally applied to [[37 Leonis Minoris]] in the 1814 ''Palermo Catalogue'' of [[Giuseppe Piazzi]], who mistakenly assessed the latter star as the brighter. This name was later connected by Allen with 46 Leonis Minoris\u2014an error perpetuated by subsequent astronomers.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Leo Minor}} The original \"Praecipua\", 37 Leonis Minoris, has an apparent magnitude of 4.69,{{sfn|SIMBAD 37 Leonis Minoris}} but is a distant yellow [[supergiant]] of spectral type G2.5IIa and absolute magnitude of \u22121.84,{{sfn| Kovtyukh et al.|2010}} around {{Convert|578|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=off|sigfig=3}} distant.{{sfn|SIMBAD 37 Leonis Minoris}}\n\n[[File:LeoMinorCC.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Leo Minor as seen by the naked eye]]\n[[Beta Leonis Minoris]] is a binary star system.

Separated by 11&nbsp;seconds of arc from the primary, the secondary is a [[F-type main-sequence star|yellow-white main sequence star]] of spectral type F8. The two orbit around a common [[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|centre of gravity]] every 38.62&nbsp;years,{{sfn|Kaler, ''Beta Leonis Minoris''}} and lie {{Convert|154|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=off|sigfig=2}} away from the [[Solar System]].{{sfn|SIMBAD Beta Leonis Minoris}}\n\nAround {{Convert|98|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=off|sigfig=2}} away and around 10&nbsp;times as luminous as the Sun, [[21&nbsp;Leonis Minoris]] is a rapidly rotating [[A-type main-sequence star|white main-sequence star]], spinning on its axis in less than 12&nbsp;hours and very likely flattened in shape.{{sfn|Kaler, ''21 Leonis Minoris''}} Of average apparent magnitude 4.5 and spectral type A7V, it is a [[Delta Scuti variable]].{{sfn|SIMBAD 21 Leonis Minoris}} These are short period (six hours at most) [[Variable star#Pulsating variable stars|pulsating]] stars which have been used as [[Cosmic distance ladder#Standard candles|standard candles]] and as subjects to study [[asteroseismology]].{{sfn|Delta Scuti and the Delta Scuti variables}}\n[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Leo Major and Leo Minor.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Leo Minor above the head of Leo, as depicted in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'', a set of constellation cards published in London c.&nbsp;1825{{sfn|Ridpath, Urania\u2019s Mirror}}]]\nAlso known as SU and SV Leonis Minoris, [[10&nbsp;Leonis Minoris|10]] and [[11&nbsp;Leonis Minoris]] are yellow giants of spectral type G8III, with average magnitudes 4.54 and 5.34 respectively.

The main star is another yellow star, this time a [[G-type main-sequence star|dwarf]] of spectral type G3Va and apparent magnitude 5.4.{{sfn|SIMBAD 20 Leonis Minoris}} The companion is an old, active red dwarf that has a relatively high [[metallicity]] and is of spectral type M6.5. The fact that the secondary star is brighter than expected indicates it is likely two stars very close together that are unable to be made out separately with current viewing technology.{{sfn|Gizis et al.|2000}}\n\n[[R Leonis Minoris|R]] and [[S Leonis Minoris]] are long-period [[Mira variable]]s, while [[U Leonis Minoris]] is a [[Semiregular variable star|semiregular variable]];{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=186\u201387}} all three are [[red giant]]s of spectral types M6.5e-M9.0e,{{sfn|SIMBAD R Leonis Minoris}} M5e {{sfn|SIMBAD S Leonis Minoris}} and M6 respectively.{{sfn|SIMBAD U Leonis Minoris}} R varies between magnitudes 6.3 and 13.2 during a period of 372&nbsp;days, S varies between magnitudes 8.6 and 13.9 during a period of 234&nbsp;days, and U varies between magnitudes 10.0 and 13.3 during a period of 272&nbsp;days. The lack of bright stars makes finding these objects challenging for amateur astronomers.{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=186\u201387}} [[G 117-B15A]], also known as RY Leonis Minoris, is a [[pulsating white dwarf]] of apparent magnitude 15.5.{{sfn|SIMBAD RY Leonis Minoris}} With a period of approximately 215&nbsp;seconds, and losing a second every 8.9&nbsp;million years, the 400-million-year-old star has been proposed as the most stable celestial clock.{{sfn|McDonald Observatory}}\n\n[[SX Leonis Minoris]] is a [[dwarf nova]] of the SU Ursae Majoris type that was identified in 1994.{{sfn|Nogami et al.|1997}} It consists of a white dwarf and a donor star, which orbit each other every 97&nbsp;minutes. The white dwarf sucks matter from the other star onto an [[accretion disc]] and heats up to between 6000 and 10000 K. The dwarf star erupts every 34 to 64&nbsp;days, reaching magnitude 13.4 in these outbursts and remaining at magnitude 16.8 when quiet.{{sfn|Wagner et al.|1998}}<!-- cites two previous sentences --> Leo Minor contains another dwarf nova, [[RZ Leonis Minoris]], which brightens to magnitude 14.2 from a baseline magnitude of around 17 but does so at shorter intervals than other dwarf novae.{{sfn|Robertson et al.|1995}}\n\nTwo stars with planetary systems have been found.

Outside Birmingham, in [[Solihull]], is {{rws|Birmingham International}}, which serves [[Birmingham Airport]] and the [[National Exhibition Centre]].\n===Railway operations===\nNew Street is the hub of the West Midlands rail network, as well as being a major national hub. The station is one of seventeen operated and managed by Network Rail.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/May13/Commercial_Information.pdf |title=Commercial information |date=May 2013 |work=Complete National Rail Timetable |publisher=Network Rail |location=London |page=43 |accessdate=5 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904231906/http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/May13/Commercial_Information.pdf |archive-date=4 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Network Rail also provides operational staff for the station.\n\nStation staff are provided on all platforms to assist with the safe 'dispatch' of trains. For operational reasons all trains departing New Street much be dispatched via the use of [[UK railway signalling|Right Away (RA)]] indicators. RA indicators display a signal informing the train driver it is safe to start the train, instead of using more traditional bell or hand signals.\n\nThe 12 through platforms are divided into ''a'' and ''b'' ends, with an extra bay platform called 4c between 4b and 5b, with the ''b'' end of the station towards Wolverhampton, this in effect allows twice the platforms. Longer trains that are too long for one section of the platform occupy the entire length of the platform, such as [[British Rail Class 390|Class 390]] or [[InterCity 125|HSTs]].\n\nTrains departing towards Proof House Junction (''a'' end) can depart from any platform, but there are restrictions on trains departing from the ''b'' end. All platforms can accommodate trains heading towards Wolverhampton, however due the platform layout and road bridge supports, only 5\u201312 can accommodate trains heading towards Five Ways. There are a number of sidings on the station for the stabling of trains; between platforms 5/6, 7/8, 9/10. The bay platforms at either end of platform 12 have been removed during the current{{when|date=June 2016}} rebuild. The sidings in front of New Street signal box have also been removed.\n\nAll signalling is controlled by New Street power signal box at the Wolverhampton or ''b'' end of the station; it can be seen at street level on Navigation Street. The station is allocated the [[IATA location identifier]] [http://www.theairdb.com/airport/QQN.html QQN].\n\n====Approach tunnels====\nAll trains arriving and departing must use one of the several tunnels around the station.<ref name=\"Nstr18541967\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Railway Track Diagrams 4: Midlands & North West |editor-last=Bridge |editor-first=Mike |isbn=978-0-9549866-7-4 |oclc=880581044 |last1=Yonge |first1=John |last2=Padgett |first2=David |last3=Szwenk |first3=John |edition=3rd |date=August 2013 |origyear=1990 |publisher=Trackmaps |location=Bradford on Avon |at=map 16 |ref=harv }}</ref>\n\n*Stour Valley Line Tunnel \u2013 heads westwards towards Soho Junction & Wolverhampton, and passes under the [[National Indoor Arena]]. This tunnel is {{convert|927|yard|m}} long in total, comprising the original New Street North Tunnel, {{convert|751|yard|m}} and extension: 'Arena' Tunnel, {{convert|176|yard|m}}. The former was opened in 1852 as part of the [[Stour Valley Line]], and holds two tracks.\n*New Street South Tunnel \u2013 {{convert|254|yard|m}} long, heading eastbound, passing under the [[Bull Ring Shopping Centre|Bullring]], and {{rws|Birmingham Moor Street}} station, heading towards [[Duddeston railway station|Duddeston]], [[Adderley Park railway station|Adderley Park]], the [[Camp Hill Line]] and the [[Cross Country Route|Derby lines]] towards [[Tamworth railway station|Tamworth]]. This tunnel opened in 1854, originally holding two tracks; it was widened in 1896 to hold four tracks, with two double-track parallel bores.\n*Gloucester Line Tunnels \u2013 are four separate tunnels heading south-west towards [[Five Ways railway station|Five Ways]]. Heading from New Street in sequence the tunnels are named Holliday Street Tunnel, {{convert|307|yard|m}} long; Canal Tunnel, {{convert|225|yard|m}} long, passing under the [[Birmingham Canal Navigations]]; Granville Street Tunnel, {{convert|81|yard|m}} long; and Bath Row Tunnel, {{convert|210|yard|m}} long. These tunnels opened in 1885 as part of the [[Birmingham West Suburban Railway]] and hold two tracks.\n\n===Customer service and ticketing===\nNetwork Rail, as well as operating the station, operate a customer reception located on the main concourse, and provide mobility assistance and train dispatch. The booking office and barriers are operated by [[Avanti West Coast]], with customer service or floor walker staff provided by CrossCountry and Network Rail. Avanti West Coast operates a first class lounge and [[Transport for West Midlands|Network West Midlands]] also provides a public transport information point for the station.\n\nThe station is a [[penalty fare]] station for [[West Midlands Railway]] and [[London Northwestern Railway]] (West Midlands Trains' [[brand|brands]]). This scheme is operated both onboard trains and at the automatic ticket barriers at the station. The other train operating companies that use the station do not operate penalty fare schemes.\n\n===Pollution and air quality concerns===\nThe station is designated as underground. There are fans that remove fumes but there are still a large number of services operated by diesel trains despite the whole station being electrified in the 1960s. There have been environmental concerns about the level of pollution in the station in particular NOx.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-england-birmingham-45061470?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c%26%27More%20improvements%27%20needed%20to%20cut%20station%20air%20pollution%26&ns_fee=0#post_5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c|title=BBC item regarding New Street Pollution|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Train operating companies===\nSince the [[privatisation of British Rail]] there have been thirteen [[train operating company|train companies]] that have regularly called at New Street: \n[[Arriva Trains Wales]], [[Avanti West Coast]], [[Central Trains]], [[CrossCountry]], [[First North Western]], [[London Midland]], [[Silverlink]], [[Virgin CrossCountry]], [[Virgin Trains West Coast]], [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]], [[Wales & Borders]], [[Wales & West]] and [[West Midlands Trains]].\n\nCurrently Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Transport for Wales and West Midlands Trains provide services from New Street. [[Chiltern Railways]] have occasionally used New Street during engineering works.\n\nWest Midlands Trains operates a traincrew depot at the station and stables some trains overnight around the station. For the most part, they use [[Soho TMD]] for electric traction units, with its non-electric units kept at [[Tyseley TMD]] to the southeast of Birmingham.\n\nCrossCountry also operates a traincrew depot at the station; it uses Tyseley TMD for the [[British Rail Class 170|Class 170]] units, and its Voyagers are based at [[Central Rivers TMD]].\n\n==Train services==\n[[File:Birmingham & West Mids Passenger Railway Map.JPG|thumb|Map of passenger railways in the Birmingham & West Midlands area]]\nThe basic Monday to Saturday off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is as follows:\n\n[[Avanti West Coast]]\n* 3tph to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] (1 via Rugby, 1 via Watford Junction and 1 via Milton Keynes Central).

For operational reasons all trains departing New Street much be dispatched via the use of [[UK railway signalling|Right Away (RA)]] indicators. RA indicators display a signal informing the train driver it is safe to start the train, instead of using more traditional bell or hand signals.\n\nThe 12 through platforms are divided into ''a'' and ''b'' ends, with an extra bay platform called 4c between 4b and 5b, with the ''b'' end of the station towards Wolverhampton, this in effect allows twice the platforms. Longer trains that are too long for one section of the platform occupy the entire length of the platform, such as [[British Rail Class 390|Class 390]] or [[InterCity 125|HSTs]].\n\nTrains departing towards Proof House Junction (''a'' end) can depart from any platform, but there are restrictions on trains departing from the ''b'' end. All platforms can accommodate trains heading towards Wolverhampton, however due the platform layout and road bridge supports, only 5\u201312 can accommodate trains heading towards Five Ways. There are a number of sidings on the station for the stabling of trains; between platforms 5/6, 7/8, 9/10. The bay platforms at either end of platform 12 have been removed during the current{{when|date=June 2016}} rebuild. The sidings in front of New Street signal box have also been removed.\n\nAll signalling is controlled by New Street power signal box at the Wolverhampton or ''b'' end of the station; it can be seen at street level on Navigation Street.

The former was opened in 1852 as part of the [[Stour Valley Line]], and holds two tracks.\n*New Street South Tunnel \u2013 {{convert|254|yard|m}} long, heading eastbound, passing under the [[Bull Ring Shopping Centre|Bullring]], and {{rws|Birmingham Moor Street}} station, heading towards [[Duddeston railway station|Duddeston]], [[Adderley Park railway station|Adderley Park]], the [[Camp Hill Line]] and the [[Cross Country Route|Derby lines]] towards [[Tamworth railway station|Tamworth]]. This tunnel opened in 1854, originally holding two tracks; it was widened in 1896 to hold four tracks, with two double-track parallel bores.\n*Gloucester Line Tunnels \u2013 are four separate tunnels heading south-west towards [[Five Ways railway station|Five Ways]]. Heading from New Street in sequence the tunnels are named Holliday Street Tunnel, {{convert|307|yard|m}} long; Canal Tunnel, {{convert|225|yard|m}} long, passing under the [[Birmingham Canal Navigations]]; Granville Street Tunnel, {{convert|81|yard|m}} long; and Bath Row Tunnel, {{convert|210|yard|m}} long.

This scheme is operated both onboard trains and at the automatic ticket barriers at the station. The other train operating companies that use the station do not operate penalty fare schemes.\n\n===Pollution and air quality concerns===\nThe station is designated as underground. There are fans that remove fumes but there are still a large number of services operated by diesel trains despite the whole station being electrified in the 1960s. There have been environmental concerns about the level of pollution in the station in particular NOx.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-england-birmingham-45061470?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c%26%27More%20improvements%27%20needed%20to%20cut%20station%20air%20pollution%26&ns_fee=0#post_5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c|title=BBC item regarding New Street Pollution|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Train operating companies===\nSince the [[privatisation of British Rail]] there have been thirteen [[train operating company|train companies]] that have regularly called at New Street: \n[[Arriva Trains Wales]], [[Avanti West Coast]], [[Central Trains]], [[CrossCountry]], [[First North Western]], [[London Midland]], [[Silverlink]], [[Virgin CrossCountry]], [[Virgin Trains West Coast]], [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]], [[Wales & Borders]], [[Wales & West]] and [[West Midlands Trains]].\n\nCurrently Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Transport for Wales and West Midlands Trains provide services from New Street.

The collision caused the guards van of the Derby train to [[telescoping (railway)|telescope]] with the rear coach. Three people were killed, and twenty four injured. The later inquest ruled that the express had overrun the danger signal due to driver error, and the misty conditions had made the rails moist, leading to wheelslip when the train tried to brake.<ref>{{cite web|title=1921 accident report|url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/MoT_BirminghamNewStreet1921.pdf|publisher=Railways Archive|accessdate=10 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gateway Plus]]\n* [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station]]\n* [[Birmingham Moor Street railway station]]\n* [[Transport in Birmingham]]\n* [[Transport for West Midlands]]\n* [[Commuter rail in the United Kingdom]]\n*[[Grand Central, Birmingham]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Foster, Richard, ''Birmingham New Street.
