Construction on the segment of the line that includes 53rd Street started on March 15, 1913, and was completed in 1915.

By his mid-teens, he was creating original designs of his own in the flat, two-dimensional style of car catalogs of the time. It was the originality and style of these early drawings that would later get the attention of prospective employers.<sup>[1]</sup>\n\n==Chrysler Corporation, Ken Lee, and the Star Car: 1934\u20131940==\nIn late 1934, Pietsch left [[Baltimore]] for [[Detroit]] where he began his career under Ken Lee as a junior draftsman for the [[Chrysler Corporation]], serving initially as an apprentice but eventually working up to duties equivalent to those of a \"senior designer.\" His first major assignment was head designer of what was then called simply the \"Ken Lee Research Car,\" an experimental small car that later became known as the \"Star Car.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lamm|first=Michael|date=1972|title=MoPar\u2019s star cars: were these two fwd, 5-cyl. experimentals Chrysler\u2019s answer to GM\u2019s X-Cars?|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=10|pages=16-21}}</ref> The uncanny resemblance of this car to the German [[Volkswagen]] led to speculation that Pietsch's design was copied by [[Ferdinand Porsche]] who had been instructed by [[Hitler]] to produce the \"People's Car\" and who most probably saw the \"Star Car\" during one or both of his visits to Detroit in 1936.<sup>[1]</sup><ref>{{Cite book|last=Curio|first=Vincent|title=Chrysler: The Life and Times of an Automotive Genius|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Oxford and New York|pages=521, 556}}</ref>\n\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DeSoto 1937.jpg|thumb|right|\nDeSoto, four-door sedan, with waving woman, by T.

At Hudson Motor he was also assigned to war work that consisted of making accurate perspective drawings of airplane assemblies and subassemblies from blueprints, and air-brush retouching of photographs (that were later used in an instruction manual prepared for the armed services) of mechanical parts of an anti-aircraft gun.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koto|first=Holden N.|date=1976|title=Living with style by Holden Koto, as told to Michael Lamm|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=32|pages=40|via=}}</ref> It would be projects like this, but in particular the years spent interpreting the blueprints for the [[B-29]], that protected him against the draft and provided military deferment throughout the war.<sup>[1]</sup>\n\n==Briggs Manufacturing Company and the Packard Clipper: 1944\u20131947==\nIn autumn 1944, Pietsch left Hudson to work for [[Briggs Manufacturing Company]], a company founded in 1908 by Walter Owen Briggs (1877\u20131952) that became the world's largest independent producer of automobile bodies. During the war, the company was a major supplier for the U.S. military, producing over a billion dollars worth of steel and aluminum products. In 1944, a record workforce of some 31,000 men and women built a wide variety of items, including aircraft gun turrets, wings, stabilizers, ailerons, tank hulls, bomb and wheel doors for the [[B-29]], to mention only a few.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lamm|first=Michael|date=1973|title=Body by Briggs|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=19|pages=29|via=}}</ref> But by September 1944, when Pietsch signed on, they were already looking ahead to post-war car designs, and efforts were underway to secure contracts for automotive bodies from [[Packard]] and [[Chrysler]], among other companies.<sup>[10]</sup> Early styling projects assigned to Pietsch included work on the [[Packard]] Clipper as well as some formal limousines on [[Chrysler]] chassis, and \"special sedans,\" some designed specifically for [[Walter P. Chrysler]] and others for W. O. Briggs himself, none of which were ever built.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Blue Roadster.jpg|thumb|left|\nClassic car series, Blue Roadster,<br /> by T. W.

In October 1947, with samples of his work in tow, he interviewed successfully and by mid-November of that year, he was working at [[Ford]] as the new assistant head of styling in the Ford studio, working initially in exteriors under the supervision of Adrian Gil Spear. For most U.S. automobile companies, designs for the first two or three postwar years were not much more than facelifts of 1941 and 1942 models. This was certainly true for Ford\u2014efforts in 1946 were nearly all directed toward the first all-new model, which turned out to be the highly successful 1949 Ford.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bridges|first=John|title=Bob Bourke Designs for Studebaker|publisher=J.

Exner had the salesmanship and persuasiveness required to make badly needed changes that would by the mid-1950s bring [[Chrysler]] to the forefront of American automobile design.<sup>[1]</sup><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Godshall|first=Jeff|date=1975|title=The last DeSoto: Styling by Virgil Exner|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=26|pages=14|via=}}</ref> Now as Director of Styling, Exner set about rebuilding the department, turning it into the talk of the town, not only among Detroit's styling circles but of the entire country. Pietsch played a decisive role in this domestic success as well as in Chrysler's association with Italian auto makers\u2014first, a short-lived relationship with [[Pinin Farina]] in 1950, and then, in the following year, with [[Carrozzeria Ghia]] of [[Turin]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|date=1975|title=Thinking ahead: Ghia-Chrysler showcars|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=30|pages=18|via=}}</ref> By 1953, a half a dozen Italian-built Chrysler show-cars had been created. Under these ideal working conditions, it's a wonder that Pietsch didn't stay longer with Exner\u2014the potential at [[Chrysler]] for new and exciting things was enormous, but once again the thrill of a new challenge was too great. Responding in early 1952 to an attractive offer from [[Raymond Loewy]], brokered in part by his old friend Bob Koto, he moved from Detroit to [[South Bend, Indiana]], to join [[Raymond Loewy and Associates]], which at the time held the [[Studebaker]] design contract.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Blue Coupe.jpg|thumb|right|\n\"Banshee,\" two-door coupe, with transparent Plexiglas top, by T.

Shortly thereafter, all kinds of lucrative contracts came his way. By the late 1930s and early 40s, he had sold designs for [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] buses, Pensy railcars and locomotives, [[TWA]] sleeper planes, [[Matson, Inc.|Matson]] ships and large ocean liners, [[Pepsodent]] toothpaste tubes, [[Schick (razors)|Schick]] electric shavers, buildings of all kinds, including supermarkets, and hundreds of other products, not the least of which were [[Studebaker]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lamm|first=Michael|date=1971|title=Before the new wore off: What the \"Stude Graveyard\" cars looked like when new|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=6|pages=13|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Reese|first=Elizabeth|title=Raymond Loewy: Pioneer of American Industrial Design|publisher=Prestel-Verlag|year=1990|isbn=|location=Munich, Germany|pages=39-41}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 31, 1949|title=Up from the Egg|url=|journal=Time Magazine|volume=54(18)|pages=68-74|via=}}</ref>\n\nWorking for [[Raymond Loewy]] and Associates, which at that time was responsible for all [[Studebaker]] styling, was a unique experience. There were no individual studios set up with all sorts of titles for the designers, just several large rooms located in the old Chippewa Avenue truck plant in [[South Bend]] where [[Studebaker]] had manufactured its aircraft engines and army trucks during the war. The designers had just one boss, Bob Bourke, and his assistant, Bob Koto, and everyone, including Bourke and Koto, wore many hats. They sketched, and modeled in clay; in fact, the emphasis was on modeling. They often worked into the small hours of the morning with no overtime pay. The clay work was new to Pietsch and by his own admission he never became very adept at it because designers in [[Detroit]], where he had received all his prior training, were not involved in modeling. He strongly believed, however, that designers should be skilled at drawing and rendering as well as modeling.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Two-tone Coupe.jpg|thumb|left|\nTwo-tone Coupe, by T.

Pietsch remembers management complaining about how European styling ruined [[Studebaker]], but it was, in his opinion, all misplaced condemnation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|title=Studebaker 1946\u20131966: The Classic Postwar Years|publisher=Motorbooks International Publishers and Wholesalers|year=1993|isbn=|location=Osceola, Wisconsin|pages=165}}</ref>\n\nThings were so bad by late 1953 that discussion turned to the idea of teaming up with another car company, and by the following June, with sales for 1954 worse than ever, a merger with [[Packard]] was approved.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|title=Studebaker 1946\u20131966: The Classic Postwar Years|publisher=Motorbooks International Publishers and Wholesalers|year=1993|isbn=|location=Osceola, Wisconsin|pages=72}}</ref> The new [[Studebaker-Packard]] management decided to sever the expensive relationship with [[Loewy]] and Associates, thinking that their own in-house styling team should be given full control of [[Studebaker]] design efforts.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|title=Studebaker 1946\u20131966: The Classic Postwar Years|publisher=Motorbooks International Publishers and Wholesalers|year=1993|isbn=|location=Osceola, Wisconsin|pages=81}}</ref> Thus, in early 1955, the contract with [[Raymond Loewy]], which had existed since 1938, was not renewed, and Pietsch, along with everyone else, was given the option of staying with [[Loewy]] or switching over to [[Studebaker]] proper. Pietsch decided that the [[Loewy]] situation was much too tenuous and, even as shabby as [[Studebaker]] was at the time, opted to stay with the sinking ship.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Blue pick-up.jpg|thumb|right|\nDesign for a Studebaker, cab-forward, pick-up truck, by T.

But despite reorganization and new faces, [[Studebaker-Packard]] remained in deep trouble.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|title=Studebaker 1946\u20131966: The Classic Postwar Years|publisher=Motorbooks International Publishers and Wholesalers|year=1993|isbn=|location=Osceola, Wisconsin|pages=102}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|title=Studebaker 1946\u20131966: The Classic Postwar Years|publisher=Motorbooks International Publishers and Wholesalers|year=1993|isbn=|location=Osceola, Wisconsin|pages=131, 141}}</ref> In 1958, the situation was so dire that Pietsch and a number of his fellow designers were laid off. Now, for the first time in his career, Pietsch was unable to immediately step into another automotive design job. After several months looking for work in the [[South Bend]] area, he went to [[Chicago]], where he was soon offered a position by the industrial design firm of Dave Chapman, Incorporated. Commuting weekly by train between [[South Bend]] and [[Chicago]], he was responsible for the account of a department of [[Montgomery Ward]] and Company, which included, among other things, the design of water heaters, water softeners, water pumps, furnaces, air-conditioners, incinerators, and ventilating fans. He also did considerable work on the design of boats, outboard motors, and radios.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Red Sovereign.jpg|thumb|left|\nSovereign Coupe, black airbrush on red paper, by T.

Pietsch, 1968]] -->\n\nUnhappy with the work in [[Chicago]], Pietsch returned to [[South Bend]] where he found employment for a few months with another small industrial design firm called Good Design Associates, but then, in late 1959, he got back to cars\u2014this time, with [[American Motors]] in [[Detroit]], a job he held for only about a year, quitting abruptly when he was suddenly called back to [[Studebaker]]. Randal D. Faurot, newly appointed head of styling, called on Pietsch to help rebuild the department, offering him a position as his assistant that he couldn't refuse. In June 1962, however, frustrated and angry over management's abrupt decision to cancel a project that he had worked for many months\u2014the design for an all-new version of the [[Studebaker]] Lark for 1962\u2014Pietsch lost his temper and was fired.<sup>[1]</sup> It was a tumultuous and abrupt ending to a frustrating, decade-long struggle at [[Studebaker]].\n\n==A last Stint at Chrysler, American Motors, and Retirement: 1962\u20131972==\nOnce again out of work, Pietsch wrote on July 2, 1962, to his old friend Cliff Voss in [[Detroit]], one of \"Exner's boys,\" with whom he had worked at [[Chrysler]] back in the early 1950s. Within a few weeks, Pietsch was back for a third and final hitch with the [[Chrysler Corporation]], but these turned out to be unhappy years. [[Chrysler]] was by now a completely different place. There was no longer the camaraderie and warm atmosphere that had been there before. The studios were now segregated and the old feeling of team effort, along with most of his old friends, was gone. Styling had become a big well-structured and impersonal organization much like the situation at [[Ford]] and [[General Motors]].\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lynx convertible.jpg|thumb|right|\n\"Lynx,\" two-seater convertible, by T.

Pietsch, 1969]] -->\n\nAdding to the disappointment, Pietsch was assigned from the start to \"interiors,\" which meant dashboards\u2014sketches and more sketches of instruments and instrument panels, reminiscent of the work that had \"bored him to death\" back at [[Ford]] in the late 1940s. Soon this narrowed down to nothing but \"ornamentation,\" in which he was obliged to spend all his time designing nameplates, lettering, and the configuration of numerals on speedometers, tachometers, and other instruments, all extremely tedious work. But he stuck with it for seven and a half years, exclaiming later that he didn't know how he managed to do it for so long.\n\nIn February 1970, Pietsch was caught one last time in one of the many [[Chrysler]] lay-offs, but, lucky once again, he got a call a short time later from [[American Motors]], asking if he'd like to go to work for [[Jeep]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Foster|first=P.R.|title=The Story of Jeep, 2nd edition|publisher=Krause Publications|year=2004|isbn=|location=Lola, Wisconsin|pages=132}}</ref> But before Pietsch realized it, he was right back where he had been at [[Chrysler]] the year before, \"doing mostly calibrations of the numerals on dashboard instruments.\" That his graphics were used without change on the instrument panels of the '72 and '73 [[Jeep Wagoneer]] provided little satisfaction. There was nothing about the [[Jeep]] line that interested him. Although he did his best every day to appear enthusiastic, Pietsch was so bored at work that he \"could hardly see straight,\" and he worried also that his health was beginning to fail. In February 1972, after only two years with Jeep, he decided to retire.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TWP at home.jpg|thumb|left|\nTheodore Wells Pietsch II, working at home, Highland Park, Michigan, 1938]] -->\n\n==Personal life==\nOn June 24, 1938, Pietsch married Louise Mary Shamlian (December 1, 1914, Watertown, Massachusetts \u2212 January 15, 1987, Seal Beach, California), with whom he had three children: Priscilla Esther Pietsch, born December 22, 1941; [[Theodore Wells Pietsch III]], March 6, 1945; and Louise Jean Pietsch May 11, 1948.

By his mid-teens, he was creating original designs of his own in the flat, two-dimensional style of car catalogs of the time. It was the originality and style of these early drawings that would later get the attention of prospective employers.<sup>[1]</sup>\n\n==Chrysler Corporation, Ken Lee, and the Star Car: 1934\u20131940==\nIn late 1934, Pietsch left [[Baltimore]] for [[Detroit]] where he began his career under Ken Lee as a junior draftsman for the [[Chrysler Corporation]], serving initially as an apprentice but eventually working up to duties equivalent to those of a \"senior designer.\" His first major assignment was head designer of what was then called simply the \"Ken Lee Research Car,\" an experimental small car that later became known as the \"Star Car.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lamm|first=Michael|date=1972|title=MoPar\u2019s star cars: were these two fwd, 5-cyl. experimentals Chrysler\u2019s answer to GM\u2019s X-Cars?|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=10|pages=16-21}}</ref> The uncanny resemblance of this car to the German [[Volkswagen]] led to speculation that Pietsch's design was copied by [[Ferdinand Porsche]] who had been instructed by [[Hitler]] to produce the \"People's Car\" and who most probably saw the \"Star Car\" during one or both of his visits to Detroit in 1936.<sup>[1]</sup><ref>{{Cite book|last=Curio|first=Vincent|title=Chrysler: The Life and Times of an Automotive Genius|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Oxford and New York|pages=521, 556}}</ref>\n\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DeSoto 1937.jpg|thumb|right|\nDeSoto, four-door sedan, with waving woman, by T.

At Hudson Motor he was also assigned to war work that consisted of making accurate perspective drawings of airplane assemblies and subassemblies from blueprints, and air-brush retouching of photographs (that were later used in an instruction manual prepared for the armed services) of mechanical parts of an anti-aircraft gun.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koto|first=Holden N.|date=1976|title=Living with style by Holden Koto, as told to Michael Lamm|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=32|pages=40|via=}}</ref> It would be projects like this, but in particular the years spent interpreting the blueprints for the [[B-29]], that protected him against the draft and provided military deferment throughout the war.<sup>[1]</sup>\n\n==Briggs Manufacturing Company and the Packard Clipper: 1944\u20131947==\nIn autumn 1944, Pietsch left Hudson to work for [[Briggs Manufacturing Company]], a company founded in 1908 by Walter Owen Briggs (1877\u20131952) that became the world's largest independent producer of automobile bodies. During the war, the company was a major supplier for the U.S. military, producing over a billion dollars worth of steel and aluminum products. In 1944, a record workforce of some 31,000 men and women built a wide variety of items, including aircraft gun turrets, wings, stabilizers, ailerons, tank hulls, bomb and wheel doors for the [[B-29]], to mention only a few.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lamm|first=Michael|date=1973|title=Body by Briggs|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=19|pages=29|via=}}</ref> But by September 1944, when Pietsch signed on, they were already looking ahead to post-war car designs, and efforts were underway to secure contracts for automotive bodies from [[Packard]] and [[Chrysler]], among other companies.<sup>[10]</sup> Early styling projects assigned to Pietsch included work on the [[Packard]] Clipper as well as some formal limousines on [[Chrysler]] chassis, and \"special sedans,\" some designed specifically for [[Walter P. Chrysler]] and others for W. O. Briggs himself, none of which were ever built.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Blue Roadster.jpg|thumb|left|\nClassic car series, Blue Roadster,<br /> by T. W.

In October 1947, with samples of his work in tow, he interviewed successfully and by mid-November of that year, he was working at [[Ford]] as the new assistant head of styling in the Ford studio, working initially in exteriors under the supervision of Adrian Gil Spear. For most U.S. automobile companies, designs for the first two or three postwar years were not much more than facelifts of 1941 and 1942 models. This was certainly true for Ford\u2014efforts in 1946 were nearly all directed toward the first all-new model, which turned out to be the highly successful 1949 Ford.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bridges|first=John|title=Bob Bourke Designs for Studebaker|publisher=J.

Exner had the salesmanship and persuasiveness required to make badly needed changes that would by the mid-1950s bring [[Chrysler]] to the forefront of American automobile design.<sup>[1]</sup><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Godshall|first=Jeff|date=1975|title=The last DeSoto: Styling by Virgil Exner|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=26|pages=14|via=}}</ref> Now as Director of Styling, Exner set about rebuilding the department, turning it into the talk of the town, not only among Detroit's styling circles but of the entire country. Pietsch played a decisive role in this domestic success as well as in Chrysler's association with Italian auto makers\u2014first, a short-lived relationship with [[Pinin Farina]] in 1950, and then, in the following year, with [[Carrozzeria Ghia]] of [[Turin]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|date=1975|title=Thinking ahead: Ghia-Chrysler showcars|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=30|pages=18|via=}}</ref> By 1953, a half a dozen Italian-built Chrysler show-cars had been created. Under these ideal working conditions, it's a wonder that Pietsch didn't stay longer with Exner\u2014the potential at [[Chrysler]] for new and exciting things was enormous, but once again the thrill of a new challenge was too great. Responding in early 1952 to an attractive offer from [[Raymond Loewy]], brokered in part by his old friend Bob Koto, he moved from Detroit to [[South Bend, Indiana]], to join [[Raymond Loewy and Associates]], which at the time held the [[Studebaker]] design contract.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Blue Coupe.jpg|thumb|right|\n\"Banshee,\" two-door coupe, with transparent Plexiglas top, by T.

Shortly thereafter, all kinds of lucrative contracts came his way. By the late 1930s and early 40s, he had sold designs for [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] buses, Pensy railcars and locomotives, [[TWA]] sleeper planes, [[Matson, Inc.|Matson]] ships and large ocean liners, [[Pepsodent]] toothpaste tubes, [[Schick (razors)|Schick]] electric shavers, buildings of all kinds, including supermarkets, and hundreds of other products, not the least of which were [[Studebaker]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lamm|first=Michael|date=1971|title=Before the new wore off: What the \"Stude Graveyard\" cars looked like when new|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=6|pages=13|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Reese|first=Elizabeth|title=Raymond Loewy: Pioneer of American Industrial Design|publisher=Prestel-Verlag|year=1990|isbn=|location=Munich, Germany|pages=39-41}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 31, 1949|title=Up from the Egg|url=|journal=Time Magazine|volume=54(18)|pages=68-74|via=}}</ref>\n\nWorking for [[Raymond Loewy]] and Associates, which at that time was responsible for all [[Studebaker]] styling, was a unique experience. There were no individual studios set up with all sorts of titles for the designers, just several large rooms located in the old Chippewa Avenue truck plant in [[South Bend]] where [[Studebaker]] had manufactured its aircraft engines and army trucks during the war. The designers had just one boss, Bob Bourke, and his assistant, Bob Koto, and everyone, including Bourke and Koto, wore many hats. They sketched, and modeled in clay; in fact, the emphasis was on modeling. They often worked into the small hours of the morning with no overtime pay. The clay work was new to Pietsch and by his own admission he never became very adept at it because designers in [[Detroit]], where he had received all his prior training, were not involved in modeling. He strongly believed, however, that designers should be skilled at drawing and rendering as well as modeling.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Two-tone Coupe.jpg|thumb|left|\nTwo-tone Coupe, by T.

Pietsch remembers management complaining about how European styling ruined [[Studebaker]], but it was, in his opinion, all misplaced condemnation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|title=Studebaker 1946\u20131966: The Classic Postwar Years|publisher=Motorbooks International Publishers and Wholesalers|year=1993|isbn=|location=Osceola, Wisconsin|pages=165}}</ref>\n\nThings were so bad by late 1953 that discussion turned to the idea of teaming up with another car company, and by the following June, with sales for 1954 worse than ever, a merger with [[Packard]] was approved.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|title=Studebaker 1946\u20131966: The Classic Postwar Years|publisher=Motorbooks International Publishers and Wholesalers|year=1993|isbn=|location=Osceola, Wisconsin|pages=72}}</ref> The new [[Studebaker-Packard]] management decided to sever the expensive relationship with [[Loewy]] and Associates, thinking that their own in-house styling team should be given full control of [[Studebaker]] design efforts.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|title=Studebaker 1946\u20131966: The Classic Postwar Years|publisher=Motorbooks International Publishers and Wholesalers|year=1993|isbn=|location=Osceola, Wisconsin|pages=81}}</ref> Thus, in early 1955, the contract with [[Raymond Loewy]], which had existed since 1938, was not renewed, and Pietsch, along with everyone else, was given the option of staying with [[Loewy]] or switching over to [[Studebaker]] proper. Pietsch decided that the [[Loewy]] situation was much too tenuous and, even as shabby as [[Studebaker]] was at the time, opted to stay with the sinking ship.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Blue pick-up.jpg|thumb|right|\nDesign for a Studebaker, cab-forward, pick-up truck, by T.

Now, for the first time in his career, Pietsch was unable to immediately step into another automotive design job. After several months looking for work in the [[South Bend]] area, he went to [[Chicago]], where he was soon offered a position by the industrial design firm of Dave Chapman, Incorporated. Commuting weekly by train between [[South Bend]] and [[Chicago]], he was responsible for the account of a department of [[Montgomery Ward]] and Company, which included, among other things, the design of water heaters, water softeners, water pumps, furnaces, air-conditioners, incinerators, and ventilating fans. He also did considerable work on the design of boats, outboard motors, and radios.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Red Sovereign.jpg|thumb|left|\nSovereign Coupe, black airbrush on red paper, by T.

Pietsch, 1968]] -->\n\nUnhappy with the work in [[Chicago]], Pietsch returned to [[South Bend]] where he found employment for a few months with another small industrial design firm called Good Design Associates, but then, in late 1959, he got back to cars\u2014this time, with [[American Motors]] in [[Detroit]], a job he held for only about a year, quitting abruptly when he was suddenly called back to [[Studebaker]]. Randal D. Faurot, newly appointed head of styling, called on Pietsch to help rebuild the department, offering him a position as his assistant that he couldn't refuse. In June 1962, however, frustrated and angry over management's abrupt decision to cancel a project that he had worked for many months\u2014the design for an all-new version of the [[Studebaker]] Lark for 1962\u2014Pietsch lost his temper and was fired.<sup>[1]</sup> It was a tumultuous and abrupt ending to a frustrating, decade-long struggle at [[Studebaker]].\n\n==A last Stint at Chrysler, American Motors, and Retirement: 1962\u20131972==\nOnce again out of work, Pietsch wrote on July 2, 1962, to his old friend Cliff Voss in [[Detroit]], one of \"Exner's boys,\" with whom he had worked at [[Chrysler]] back in the early 1950s. Within a few weeks, Pietsch was back for a third and final hitch with the [[Chrysler Corporation]], but these turned out to be unhappy years. [[Chrysler]] was by now a completely different place. There was no longer the camaraderie and warm atmosphere that had been there before. The studios were now segregated and the old feeling of team effort, along with most of his old friends, was gone. Styling had become a big well-structured and impersonal organization much like the situation at [[Ford]] and [[General Motors]].\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lynx convertible.jpg|thumb|right|\n\"Lynx,\" two-seater convertible, by T.

Pietsch, 1969]] -->\n\nAdding to the disappointment, Pietsch was assigned from the start to \"interiors,\" which meant dashboards\u2014sketches and more sketches of instruments and instrument panels, reminiscent of the work that had \"bored him to death\" back at [[Ford]] in the late 1940s. Soon this narrowed down to nothing but \"ornamentation,\" in which he was obliged to spend all his time designing nameplates, lettering, and the configuration of numerals on speedometers, tachometers, and other instruments, all extremely tedious work. But he stuck with it for seven and a half years, exclaiming later that he didn't know how he managed to do it for so long.\n\nIn February 1970, Pietsch was caught one last time in one of the many [[Chrysler]] lay-offs, but, lucky once again, he got a call a short time later from [[American Motors]], asking if he'd like to go to work for [[Jeep]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Foster|first=P.R.|title=The Story of Jeep, 2nd edition|publisher=Krause Publications|year=2004|isbn=|location=Lola, Wisconsin|pages=132}}</ref> But before Pietsch realized it, he was right back where he had been at [[Chrysler]] the year before, \"doing mostly calibrations of the numerals on dashboard instruments.\" That his graphics were used without change on the instrument panels of the '72 and '73 [[Jeep Wagoneer]] provided little satisfaction. There was nothing about the [[Jeep]] line that interested him. Although he did his best every day to appear enthusiastic, Pietsch was so bored at work that he \"could hardly see straight,\" and he worried also that his health was beginning to fail. In February 1972, after only two years with Jeep, he decided to retire.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TWP at home.jpg|thumb|left|\nTheodore Wells Pietsch II, working at home, Highland Park, Michigan, 1938]] -->\n\n==Personal life==\nOn June 24, 1938, Pietsch married Louise Mary Shamlian (December 1, 1914, Watertown, Massachusetts \u2212 January 15, 1987, Seal Beach, California), with whom he had three children: Priscilla Esther Pietsch, born December 22, 1941; [[Theodore Wells Pietsch III]], March 6, 1945; and Louise Jean Pietsch May 11, 1948.

It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in [[progressive rock]], [[electronic music|electronic]], [[art rock]], [[disco]], and particularly the \"[[Krautrock]]\" of bands like [[Kraftwerk]]. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the [[post-punk]] era as part of the [[New wave music|new wave]] movement of the late 1970s to the mid-1980s.\n\nEarly synth-pop pioneers included Japanese group [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]], and British bands [[Ultravox]], [[the Human League]] and [[Berlin Blondes]]{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; proof needed that they are regarded as pioneers.|date=May 2018}}. [[The Human League]] used [[monophonic synthesizer]]s to produce music with a simple and austere sound. After the breakthrough of [[Gary Numan]] in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1979, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound in the early 1980s, including late-1970s debutants like [[Japan (band)|Japan]] and [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]], and newcomers such as [[Depeche Mode]] and [[Eurythmics]]. In Japan, Yellow Magic Orchestra's success opened the way for synth-pop bands such as [[P-Model]], [[Plastics (band)|Plastics]], and [[Hikashu]]. The development of inexpensive [[polyphonic]] synthesizers, the definition of [[MIDI]] and the use of [[Dance music|dance]] beats, led to a more commercial and accessible sound for synth-pop. This, its adoption by the style-conscious acts from the [[New Romantic]] movement, together with the rise of [[MTV]], led to success for large numbers of British synth-pop acts (including [[Duran Duran]] and [[Spandau Ballet]]) in the United States.\n\nThe use of digital sampling and [[Loop (music)|looping]] in popular music was pioneered by Japanese [[electronic music]] band [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] (YMO).<ref>{{cite book|title=Tokyo city guide|author=Mayumi Yoshida Barakan & Judith Connor Greer|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=1996|isbn=0-8048-1964-5|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vJbd43uxLiMC&pg=PA144|accessdate=2011-06-06}}</ref><ref name=\"thevinyldistrict\">{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Monica|title=It's Easy When You\u2019re Big In Japan: Yellow Magic Orchestra at The Hollywood Bowl|work=The Vinyl District|url=http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/losangeles/2011/06/it%E2%80%99s-easy-when-you%E2%80%99re-big-in-japan-yellow-magic-orchestra-at-the-hollywood-bowl/|accessdate=22 July 2011|date=June 30, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"condry_59\"/><ref name=\"rockin\"/> Their approach to sampling was a precursor to the contemporary approach of constructing music by cutting fragments of sounds and looping them using computer technology.<ref name=\"condry_59\">{{cite book|last=Condry|first=Ian|title=Hip-hop Japan: rap and the paths of cultural globalization|year=2006|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|isbn=0-8223-3892-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=37QWE3yRY-4C&pg=PA59|page=60}}</ref> \"[[Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)|Computer Game/Firecracker]]\" (1978) interpolated a [[Martin Denny]] melody,<ref name=\"guardian_ymo\">{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=John|title=Back to the future: Yellow Magic Orchestra helped usher in electronica&nbsp;\u2013 and they may just have invented hip-hop, too|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/04/electronicmusic.filmandmusic11|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=25 May 2011|date=4 July 2008|location=London}}</ref> and sampled ''[[Space Invaders]]''<ref name=\"wire_2002\">{{citation|title=The Wire, Issues 221\u2013226|work=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]|year=2002|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qyFMAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> [[Video game music|video game sounds]].<ref name=\"guardian_ymo\"/> ''[[Technodelic]]'' (1981) introduced the use of digital sampling in popular music, as the first album consisting of mostly samples and [[Loop (music)|loops]].<ref name=\"thevinyldistrict\"/><ref name=\"rockin\"/> The album was produced using [[Toshiba-EMI]]'s LMD-649 digital [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]], which engineer Kenji Murata custom-built for YMO.<ref name=\"rockin\">''[[:nl:Rockin'f|Rockin'f]]'', March 1982, [http://tokyosky.sub.jp/tokyosky_webmasters_blog/2011/02/f-19823-lmd-649-1982.html pages 140\u2013141]{{Better source|date=April 2018|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}</ref> The LMD-649 was also used for sampling by other Japanese [[synthpop]] artists in the early 1980s, including YMO-associated acts such as [[:ja:\u771f\u934b\u3061\u3048\u307f|Chiemi Manabe]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Chiemi-Manabe-%E4%B8%8D%E6%80%9D%E8%AD%B0%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3-/release/4389700|title=Chiemi Manabe \u2013 \u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u30fb\u5c11\u5973|website=Discogs}}</ref> and [[Hideki Matsutake|Logic System]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Logic-System-Orient-Express/release/703523|title=Logic System \u2013 Orient Express|website=Discogs}}</ref>\n\n===Dance music in the 1980s===\n{{See also|New school hip hop|Miami bass|Freestyle music|Hip house|Latin house|Industrial dance music}}\n\nThe emergence of electronic dance music in the 1980s was shaped by the development of several new [[electronic musical instrument]]s, particularly those from the Japanese [[Roland Corporation]].

This subgenre was known as \"hardcore\" rave, but from as early as 1991, some musical tracks made up of these high-tempo break beats, with heavy basslines and samples of older Jamaican music, were referred to as \"jungle [[techno]]\", a genre influenced by [[Jack Smooth]] and Basement Records, and later just \"jungle\", which became recognized as a separate musical genre popular at raves and on [[pirate radio]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. It is important to note when discussing the history of drum & bass that prior to jungle, rave music was getting faster and more experimental.\n\nBy 1994, jungle had begun to gain mainstream popularity and fans of the music (often referred to as [[junglist]]s) became a more recognisable part of youth subculture. The genre further developed, incorporating and fusing elements from a wide range of existing musical genres, including the [[raggamuffin music|raggamuffin]] sound, [[dancehall]], [[Rapping|MC]] chants, dub basslines, and increasingly complex, heavily edited breakbeat percussion. Despite the affiliation with the ecstasy-fuelled rave scene, Jungle also inherited some associations with violence and criminal activity, both from the gang culture that had affected the UK's hip-hop scene and as a consequence of jungle's often aggressive or menacing sound and themes of violence (usually reflected in the choice of samples). However, this developed in tandem with the often positive reputation of the music as part of the wider rave scene and dance hall-based Jamaican music culture prevalent in London. By 1995, whether as a reaction to, or independently of this cultural schism, some jungle producers began to move away from the ragga-influenced style and create what would become collectively labelled, for convenience, as drum and bass.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last = Reynolds\n|first = Simon\n|title = Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture\n|year = 2013\n|publisher = Soft Skull Press\n|quote = So when I talk about the vibe disappearing from drum and bass, I'm talking about the blackness going as the ragga samples get phased out, the bass loses its reggae feels and becomes more linear and propulsive rather than moving around the beat with a syncopated relation with the drum.\n}}</ref>\n\n===Dance music in the 21st century===\n{{See also|Bass music|Crunk|Trap music|Trap music (EDM)|Footwork (genre)|Electroclash|Moombahton|Microgenres}}\n\n====Dubstep====\n{{Main|Dubstep}}\nDubstep is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in [[South London]] in the late 1990s. It is generally characterized by sparse, [[syncopation|syncopated]] rhythmic [[Drum pattern|patterns]] with [[bass line]]s that contain prominent [[sub-bass]] frequencies. The style emerged as an offshoot of [[UK garage]], drawing on a lineage of related styles such as [[2-step garage|2-step]], [[dub reggae]], [[Oldschool jungle|jungle]],  [[broken beat]], and [[grime (music genre)|grime]].<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/style/dubstep-ma0000004465 AllMusic \u2013 Dubstep] \"Absorbed and transfigured elements of techno, drum'n' bass and dub\"</ref><ref name=Reynolds>Reynolds, S.(2012),''Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture,'' Perseus Books; Reprint edition (5 Jan 2012), pages&nbsp;511\u2013516, ({{ISBN|978-1-59376-407-4}}).</ref> In the United Kingdom the origins of the genre can be traced back to the growth of the [[Sound system (Jamaican)|Jamaican sound system]] party scene in the early 1980s.<ref name=Reynolds /><ref>[http://uncarved.org/dub/splash/ The Big Big Sound System Splashdown], [[New Musical Express]], 21 February 1981, {{ISSN|0028-6362}}.</ref>\n\nThe earliest dubstep releases date back to 1998, and were usually featured as [[B-side]]s of [[2-step garage]] single releases. These tracks were darker, more experimental remixes with less emphasis on vocals, and attempted to incorporate elements of [[breakbeat]] and [[drum and bass]] into 2-step. In 2001, this and other strains of dark garage music began to be showcased and promoted at London's night club Plastic People, at the \"Forward\" night (sometimes stylised as FWD>>), which went on to be considerably influential to the development of dubstep. The term \"dubstep\" in reference to a genre of music began to be used by around 2002 by labels such as Big Apple, Ammunition, and Tempa, by which time stylistic trends used in creating these remixes started to become more noticeable and distinct from 2-step and [[Grime music|grime]].<ref>IMO Records [http://www.imorecords.co.uk/dubstep/hatcha-biography/ \"Hatcha Biography\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112122021/http://www.imorecords.co.uk/dubstep/hatcha-biography/ |date=12 January 2012 }}, ''[[IMO Records]]'', London, 17 October 2011.

Former Universal Music executive Eric Zho, inspired by the US growth, made the first significant investments in electronic music in China, including the organisation of [[Shanghai]]'s inaugural Storm festival in 2013, the reaching of a [[title sponsor]]ship deal for the festival with Anheuser-Busch's Budweiser brand, a local talent search, and organising collaborations between EDM producers and Chinese singers, such as [[Avicii]] and [[Wang Leehom]]'s \"Lose Myself\". In the years following, a larger number of EDM events began to appear in China, and Storm itself was also preceded by a larger number of pre-parties in 2014 than its inaugural year. A new report released during the inaugural International Music Summit China in October 2015 revealed that the Chinese EDM industry was experiencing modest gains, citing the larger number of events (including new major festival brands such as Modern Sky and YinYang), a 6% increase in the sales of electronic music in the country, and the significant size of the overall market. Zho also believed that the country's \"hands-on\" political climate, as well as investments by China into cultural events, helped in \"encouraging\" the growth of EDM in the country.<ref name=wsj-china>{{cite news|author1=Hannah Karp|title=In China, Concert Promoter Wants EDM in the Mix|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-china-concert-promoter-wants-edm-in-the-mix-1412351903 |work = Wall Street Journal|date=October 5, 2014}}</ref><ref name=thump-chinapopoff>{{cite web|title=Is the EDM Scene in China about to Pop Off?|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/is-the-edm-scene-in-china-about-to-pop-off|website=Thump|publisher=Vice Media|accessdate=17 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term \"electronic dance music\" (EDM) was used in the United States as early as 1985, although the term \"dance music\" did not catch on as a blanket term <sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-99|[95]]].</sup> Writing in ''The Guardian'', journalist [[Simon Reynolds]] noted that the American music industry's adoption of the term EDM in the late 2000s was an attempt to re-brand US \"rave culture\" and differentiate it from the 1990s rave scene. In the UK, \"dance music\" or \"dance\" are more common terms for EDM.<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-Definition-4|[4]]]</sup>What is widely perceived to be \"club music\" has changed over time; it now includes different genres and may not always encompass EDM. Similarly, \"electronic dance music\" can mean different things to different people. Both \"club music\" and \"EDM\" seem vague, but the terms are sometimes used to refer to distinct and unrelated genres (club music is defined by what is popular, whereas EDM is distinguished by musical attributes).<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-genres-100|[96]]]</sup> Until the late 1990s, when the larger US music industry created music charts for \"dance\" (''Billboard'' magazine has maintained a \"dance\" chart since 1974 and it continues to this day).<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-atlantic-96|[93]]]</sup> In July 1995, [[Nervous Records]] and ''Project X Magazine'' hosted the first awards ceremony, calling it the \"Electronic Dance Music Awards\".<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-98|[Note 4]]]</sup>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Friend's home studio (by David J).jpg|thumb|right|A typical [[home studio]] setup for EDM production with computer, audio interface and various MIDI instruments.]]\n\nElectronic dance music is generally composed and produced in a [[recording studio]] with specialized equipment such as [[sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]], [[synthesizer]]s, [[effects unit]]s and [[MIDI controller]]s all set up to interact with one another using the [[MIDI]] protocol. In the genre's early days, hardware electronic musical instruments were used and the focus in production was mainly on manipulating MIDI data as opposed to manipulating audio signals. Since the late 1990s the use of [[software]] has increased. A modern electronic music production studio generally consists of a computer running a [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW), with various [[plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] installed such as software synthesizers and effects units, which are controlled with a MIDI controller such as a [[MIDI keyboard]]. This setup is generally sufficient to complete entire productions, which are then ready for [[audio mastering|mastering]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burgess|first1=Richard James|title=The History of Music Production|date=2014|publisher=Oxford|isbn=978-0199357161|pages=136\u2013146}}</ref>\n\n===Ghost production===\nA ghost producer is a hired music producer in a business arrangement who produces a song for another DJ/artist that releases it as their own,<ref name=\"YDM\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youredm.com/2018/06/04/the-unspoken-side-of-ghost-producers/ |title=The Unspoken Side Of Ghost Producers |date=2018-06-04 |website=Your EDM |language=en-US |access-date=2018-08-05}}</ref> typically under a contract which prevents them from identifying themselves as a personnel of the song.<ref name=\"mm\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.magneticmag.com/2015/09/what-exactly-does-ghost-producer-mean/ |title=What Exactly Does \"Ghost Producer\" Mean? |website=Magnetic Magazine |language=en-us |access-date=2018-08-05}}</ref> Ghost producers receive a simple fee or royalty payments for their work and are often able to work in their preference of not having the intense pressure of fame and the lifestyle of an internationally recognized DJ.<ref name=\"YDM\"/> A ghost producer may increase their notability in the music industry by acquainting with established \"big name\" DJs and producers.<ref name=\"YDM\"/> Producers like [[Martin Garrix]]<!-- Do not add names of other random artists that are not mentioned in the source. --> and [[Porter Robinson]]<!-- Do not add names of other random artists that are not mentioned in the source. --> are often noted for their ghost production work for other producers while [[David Guetta]]<!-- Do not add names of other random artists that are not mentioned in the source. --> and [[Steve Aoki]]<!-- Do not add names of other random artists that are not mentioned in the source. --> are noted for their usage of ghost producers in their songs whereas DJs like [[Ti\u00ebsto]]<!-- Do not add names of other random artists that are not mentioned in the source. --> have been openly crediting their producers in an attempt to avoid censure and for transparency.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/3dyx73/dance-musics-dirty-little-secret-isnt-that-big-of-a-deal |title=Dance Music's \"Dirty Little Secret\" Isn't That Big of a Deal |date=2014-05-01 |website=Thump |language=en-us |access-date=2018-08-05}}</ref>\n\nMany ghost producers sign agreements that prevent them from working for anyone else or establishing themselves as a solo artist.<ref name=\"LAW\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.laweekly.com/music/ghost-producing-is-edms-dirty-little-secret-4170623 |title=\"Ghost-Producing\" Is EDM's Dirty Little Secret |last=Khawaja |first=Jemayel |date=2013-07-29 |website=L.A.

This combination is probably the main reason why it is generally seen an increase in toxicity events at rave parties since all these factors are thought to induce or enhance the toxicity (particularly the hyperthermic response) of MDMA.&nbsp;... Another report showed that MDMA users displayed multiple regions of grey matter reduction in the neocortical, bilateral cerebellum, and midline brainstem brain regions, potentially accounting for previously reported neuropsychiatric impairments in MDMA users (Cowan et al. 2003). Neuroimaging techniques, like PET, were used in combination with a 5-HTT ligand in human ''ecstasy'' users, showing lower density of brain 5-HTT sites (McCann et al. 1998, 2005, 2008). Other authors correlate the 5-HTT reductions with the memory deficits seen in humans with a history of recreational MDMA use (McCann et al. 2008). A recent study prospectively assessed the sustained effects of ''ecstasy'' use on the brain in novel MDMA users using repeated measurements with a combination of different neuroimaging parameters of neurotoxicity. The authors concluded that low MDMA dosages can produce sustained effects on brain microvasculature, white matter maturation, and possibly axonal damage (de Win et al. 2008).}}</ref> In the rave environment, the sensory effects from the music and lighting are often highly synergistic with the drug. The psychedelic amphetamine quality of MDMA offers multiple reasons for its appeals to users in the \"rave\" setting. Some users enjoy the feeling of mass communion from the inhibition-reducing effects of the drug, while others use it as party fuel because of the drug's stimulatory effects.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|title=Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415923736|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tGaRJiXe74UC&pg=PA81&dq=Generation+Ecstasy+MDMA#v=onepage&q=Generation%20Ecstasy%20MDMA&f=false}}</ref> Another drug [[para-Methoxyamphetamine]] (4-MA) also known as pink ecstasy, PMA, \"Death\" or \"Dr. Death\", it is similar to MDMA but they can take up to an hour to produce effects, which can result in hyperthermia and subsequently, organ failure.

It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in [[progressive rock]], [[electronic music|electronic]], [[art rock]], [[disco]], and particularly the \"[[Krautrock]]\" of bands like [[Kraftwerk]]. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the [[post-punk]] era as part of the [[New wave music|new wave]] movement of the late 1970s to the mid-1980s.\n\nEarly synth-pop pioneers included Japanese group [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]], and British bands [[Ultravox]], [[the Human League]] and [[Berlin Blondes]]{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; proof needed that they are regarded as pioneers.|date=May 2018}}. [[The Human League]] used [[monophonic synthesizer]]s to produce music with a simple and austere sound. After the breakthrough of [[Gary Numan]] in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1979, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound in the early 1980s, including late-1970s debutants like [[Japan (band)|Japan]] and [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]], and newcomers such as [[Depeche Mode]] and [[Eurythmics]]. In Japan, Yellow Magic Orchestra's success opened the way for synth-pop bands such as [[P-Model]], [[Plastics (band)|Plastics]], and [[Hikashu]]. The development of inexpensive [[polyphonic]] synthesizers, the definition of [[MIDI]] and the use of [[Dance music|dance]] beats, led to a more commercial and accessible sound for synth-pop. This, its adoption by the style-conscious acts from the [[New Romantic]] movement, together with the rise of [[MTV]], led to success for large numbers of British synth-pop acts (including [[Duran Duran]] and [[Spandau Ballet]]) in the United States.\n\nThe use of digital sampling and [[Loop (music)|looping]] in popular music was pioneered by Japanese [[electronic music]] band [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] (YMO).<ref>{{cite book|title=Tokyo city guide|author=Mayumi Yoshida Barakan & Judith Connor Greer|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=1996|isbn=0-8048-1964-5|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vJbd43uxLiMC&pg=PA144|accessdate=2011-06-06}}</ref><ref name=\"thevinyldistrict\">{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Monica|title=It's Easy When You\u2019re Big In Japan: Yellow Magic Orchestra at The Hollywood Bowl|work=The Vinyl District|url=http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/losangeles/2011/06/it%E2%80%99s-easy-when-you%E2%80%99re-big-in-japan-yellow-magic-orchestra-at-the-hollywood-bowl/|accessdate=22 July 2011|date=June 30, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"condry_59\"/><ref name=\"rockin\"/> Their approach to sampling was a precursor to the contemporary approach of constructing music by cutting fragments of sounds and looping them using computer technology.<ref name=\"condry_59\">{{cite book|last=Condry|first=Ian|title=Hip-hop Japan: rap and the paths of cultural globalization|year=2006|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|isbn=0-8223-3892-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=37QWE3yRY-4C&pg=PA59|page=60}}</ref> \"[[Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)|Computer Game/Firecracker]]\" (1978) interpolated a [[Martin Denny]] melody,<ref name=\"guardian_ymo\">{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=John|title=Back to the future: Yellow Magic Orchestra helped usher in electronica&nbsp;\u2013 and they may just have invented hip-hop, too|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/04/electronicmusic.filmandmusic11|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=25 May 2011|date=4 July 2008|location=London}}</ref> and sampled ''[[Space Invaders]]''<ref name=\"wire_2002\">{{citation|title=The Wire, Issues 221\u2013226|work=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]|year=2002|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qyFMAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> [[Video game music|video game sounds]].<ref name=\"guardian_ymo\"/> ''[[Technodelic]]'' (1981) introduced the use of digital sampling in popular music, as the first album consisting of mostly samples and [[Loop (music)|loops]].<ref name=\"thevinyldistrict\"/><ref name=\"rockin\"/> The album was produced using [[Toshiba-EMI]]'s LMD-649 digital [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]], which engineer Kenji Murata custom-built for YMO.<ref name=\"rockin\">''[[:nl:Rockin'f|Rockin'f]]'', March 1982, [http://tokyosky.sub.jp/tokyosky_webmasters_blog/2011/02/f-19823-lmd-649-1982.html pages 140\u2013141]{{Better source|date=April 2018|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}</ref> The LMD-649 was also used for sampling by other Japanese [[synthpop]] artists in the early 1980s, including YMO-associated acts such as [[:ja:\u771f\u934b\u3061\u3048\u307f|Chiemi Manabe]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Chiemi-Manabe-%E4%B8%8D%E6%80%9D%E8%AD%B0%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3-/release/4389700|title=Chiemi Manabe \u2013 \u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u30fb\u5c11\u5973|website=Discogs}}</ref> and [[Hideki Matsutake|Logic System]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Logic-System-Orient-Express/release/703523|title=Logic System \u2013 Orient Express|website=Discogs}}</ref>\n\n===Dance music in the 1980s===\n{{See also|New school hip hop|Miami bass|Freestyle music|Hip house|Latin house|Industrial dance music}}\n\nThe emergence of electronic dance music in the 1980s was shaped by the development of several new [[electronic musical instrument]]s, particularly those from the Japanese [[Roland Corporation]].

This music, much like [[Hip-hop music|hip-hop]] before it, combined sampled [[syncopated]] beats or break beats, other samples from a wide range of different musical genres and, occasionally, samples of music, dialogue and effects from films and television programmes. Relative to earlier styles of dance music such as house and techno, so called 'rave music' tended to emphasise bass sounds and use faster tempos, or [[Tempo|beats per minute]] (BPM). This subgenre was known as \"hardcore\" rave, but from as early as 1991, some musical tracks made up of these high-tempo break beats, with heavy basslines and samples of older Jamaican music, were referred to as \"jungle [[techno]]\", a genre influenced by [[Jack Smooth]] and Basement Records, and later just \"jungle\", which became recognized as a separate musical genre popular at raves and on [[pirate radio]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. It is important to note when discussing the history of drum & bass that prior to jungle, rave music was getting faster and more experimental.\n\nBy 1994, jungle had begun to gain mainstream popularity and fans of the music (often referred to as [[junglist]]s) became a more recognisable part of youth subculture. The genre further developed, incorporating and fusing elements from a wide range of existing musical genres, including the [[raggamuffin music|raggamuffin]] sound, [[dancehall]], [[Rapping|MC]] chants, dub basslines, and increasingly complex, heavily edited breakbeat percussion. Despite the affiliation with the ecstasy-fuelled rave scene, Jungle also inherited some associations with violence and criminal activity, both from the gang culture that had affected the UK's hip-hop scene and as a consequence of jungle's often aggressive or menacing sound and themes of violence (usually reflected in the choice of samples). However, this developed in tandem with the often positive reputation of the music as part of the wider rave scene and dance hall-based Jamaican music culture prevalent in London. By 1995, whether as a reaction to, or independently of this cultural schism, some jungle producers began to move away from the ragga-influenced style and create what would become collectively labelled, for convenience, as drum and bass.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last = Reynolds\n|first = Simon\n|title = Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture\n|year = 2013\n|publisher = Soft Skull Press\n|quote = So when I talk about the vibe disappearing from drum and bass, I'm talking about the blackness going as the ragga samples get phased out, the bass loses its reggae feels and becomes more linear and propulsive rather than moving around the beat with a syncopated relation with the drum.\n}}</ref>\n\n===Dance music in the 21st century===\n{{See also|Bass music|Crunk|Trap music|Trap music (EDM)|Footwork (genre)|Electroclash|Moombahton|Microgenres}}\n\n====Dubstep====\n{{Main|Dubstep}}\nDubstep is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in [[South London]] in the late 1990s.

These tracks were darker, more experimental remixes with less emphasis on vocals, and attempted to incorporate elements of [[breakbeat]] and [[drum and bass]] into 2-step. In 2001, this and other strains of dark garage music began to be showcased and promoted at London's night club Plastic People, at the \"Forward\" night (sometimes stylised as FWD>>), which went on to be considerably influential to the development of dubstep. The term \"dubstep\" in reference to a genre of music began to be used by around 2002 by labels such as Big Apple, Ammunition, and Tempa, by which time stylistic trends used in creating these remixes started to become more noticeable and distinct from 2-step and [[Grime music|grime]].<ref>IMO Records [http://www.imorecords.co.uk/dubstep/hatcha-biography/ \"Hatcha Biography\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112122021/http://www.imorecords.co.uk/dubstep/hatcha-biography/ |date=12 January 2012 }}, ''[[IMO Records]]'', London, 17 October 2011.

The report also identified several emerging markets for electronic dance music, including [[East Asia]], [[India]], and [[South Africa]], credited primarily to investment by domestic, as well as American and European interests.

Former Universal Music executive Eric Zho, inspired by the US growth, made the first significant investments in electronic music in China, including the organisation of [[Shanghai]]'s inaugural Storm festival in 2013, the reaching of a [[title sponsor]]ship deal for the festival with Anheuser-Busch's Budweiser brand, a local talent search, and organising collaborations between EDM producers and Chinese singers, such as [[Avicii]] and [[Wang Leehom]]'s \"Lose Myself\". In the years following, a larger number of EDM events began to appear in China, and Storm itself was also preceded by a larger number of pre-parties in 2014 than its inaugural year. A new report released during the inaugural International Music Summit China in October 2015 revealed that the Chinese EDM industry was experiencing modest gains, citing the larger number of events (including new major festival brands such as Modern Sky and YinYang), a 6% increase in the sales of electronic music in the country, and the significant size of the overall market. Zho also believed that the country's \"hands-on\" political climate, as well as investments by China into cultural events, helped in \"encouraging\" the growth of EDM in the country.<ref name=wsj-china>{{cite news|author1=Hannah Karp|title=In China, Concert Promoter Wants EDM in the Mix|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-china-concert-promoter-wants-edm-in-the-mix-1412351903 |work = Wall Street Journal|date=October 5, 2014}}</ref><ref name=thump-chinapopoff>{{cite web|title=Is the EDM Scene in China about to Pop Off?|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/is-the-edm-scene-in-china-about-to-pop-off|website=Thump|publisher=Vice Media|accessdate=17 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term \"electronic dance music\" (EDM) was used in the United States as early as 1985, although the term \"dance music\" did not catch on as a blanket term <sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-99|[95]]].</sup> Writing in ''The Guardian'', journalist [[Simon Reynolds]] noted that the American music industry's adoption of the term EDM in the late 2000s was an attempt to re-brand US \"rave culture\" and differentiate it from the 1990s rave scene. In the UK, \"dance music\" or \"dance\" are more common terms for EDM.<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-Definition-4|[4]]]</sup>What is widely perceived to be \"club music\" has changed over time; it now includes different genres and may not always encompass EDM. Similarly, \"electronic dance music\" can mean different things to different people. Both \"club music\" and \"EDM\" seem vague, but the terms are sometimes used to refer to distinct and unrelated genres (club music is defined by what is popular, whereas EDM is distinguished by musical attributes).<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-genres-100|[96]]]</sup> Until the late 1990s, when the larger US music industry created music charts for \"dance\" (''Billboard'' magazine has maintained a \"dance\" chart since 1974 and it continues to this day).<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-atlantic-96|[93]]]</sup> In July 1995, [[Nervous Records]] and ''Project X Magazine'' hosted the first awards ceremony, calling it the \"Electronic Dance Music Awards\".<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-98|[Note 4]]]</sup>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Friend's home studio (by David J).jpg|thumb|right|A typical [[home studio]] setup for EDM production with computer, audio interface and various MIDI instruments.]]\n\nElectronic dance music is generally composed and produced in a [[recording studio]] with specialized equipment such as [[sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]], [[synthesizer]]s, [[effects unit]]s and [[MIDI controller]]s all set up to interact with one another using the [[MIDI]] protocol. In the genre's early days, hardware electronic musical instruments were used and the focus in production was mainly on manipulating MIDI data as opposed to manipulating audio signals. Since the late 1990s the use of [[software]] has increased. A modern electronic music production studio generally consists of a computer running a [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW), with various [[plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] installed such as software synthesizers and effects units, which are controlled with a MIDI controller such as a [[MIDI keyboard]].

This combination is probably the main reason why it is generally seen an increase in toxicity events at rave parties since all these factors are thought to induce or enhance the toxicity (particularly the hyperthermic response) of MDMA.&nbsp;... Another report showed that MDMA users displayed multiple regions of grey matter reduction in the neocortical, bilateral cerebellum, and midline brainstem brain regions, potentially accounting for previously reported neuropsychiatric impairments in MDMA users (Cowan et al. 2003). Neuroimaging techniques, like PET, were used in combination with a 5-HTT ligand in human ''ecstasy'' users, showing lower density of brain 5-HTT sites (McCann et al. 1998, 2005, 2008). Other authors correlate the 5-HTT reductions with the memory deficits seen in humans with a history of recreational MDMA use (McCann et al. 2008). A recent study prospectively assessed the sustained effects of ''ecstasy'' use on the brain in novel MDMA users using repeated measurements with a combination of different neuroimaging parameters of neurotoxicity. The authors concluded that low MDMA dosages can produce sustained effects on brain microvasculature, white matter maturation, and possibly axonal damage (de Win et al. 2008).}}</ref> In the rave environment, the sensory effects from the music and lighting are often highly synergistic with the drug. The psychedelic amphetamine quality of MDMA offers multiple reasons for its appeals to users in the \"rave\" setting. Some users enjoy the feeling of mass communion from the inhibition-reducing effects of the drug, while others use it as party fuel because of the drug's stimulatory effects.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|title=Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415923736|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tGaRJiXe74UC&pg=PA81&dq=Generation+Ecstasy+MDMA#v=onepage&q=Generation%20Ecstasy%20MDMA&f=false}}</ref> Another drug [[para-Methoxyamphetamine]] (4-MA) also known as pink ecstasy, PMA, \"Death\" or \"Dr. Death\", it is similar to MDMA but they can take up to an hour to produce effects, which can result in hyperthermia and subsequently, organ failure.
