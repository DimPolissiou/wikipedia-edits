Originally a [[Midfielder#Winger|wide midfielder]], Bergkamp was moved to main [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] and then to [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|second striker]], where he remained throughout his playing career. Nicknamed the \"Non-[[Flying Dutchman]]\" by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] supporters due to his [[fear of flying]], Bergkamp is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation.\n\nThe son of an electrician, Bergkamp was born in [[Amsterdam]] and played as an amateur in the lower leagues. He was spotted by Ajax at age 11 and made his professional debut in 1986. Prolific form led to an international call-up with the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] a year later, attracting the attention of several European clubs. Bergkamp signed for Italian club [[Inter Milan]] in 1993, where he had two underwhelming seasons. After joining Arsenal in 1995, he rejuvenated his career, helping the club to win three [[Premier League]] titles, four [[FA Cup]] trophies, and reach the [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final]], which marked his last appearance as a player.\n\nWith the Netherlands national team, Bergkamp was selected for [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 1992]], where he impressed, scoring three goals in the tournament.<ref name=\":0\" /> At the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], he scored a memorable winning goal in the final minute of the quarterfinal against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] which has been regarded as one of the greatest [[FIFA World Cup]] goals.<ref name=\":1\" /> Bergkamp surpassed [[Faas Wilkes]]'s record to become the country's top goalscorer of all time in 1998, a record later eclipsed by [[Patrick Kluivert]], [[Robin van Persie]] and [[Klaas-Jan Huntelaar]].\n\nBergkamp has been described by [[Jan Mulder (footballer)|Jan Mulder]] as having \"the finest technique\" of any Dutch international<ref name=\"Burgcamp\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/017c244e-d6da-11da-b64c-0000779e2340.html#axzz1tS5U1MZp|title=No more walking in a 'Burgcamp' Wonderland|last=Kuper|first=Simon|date=28 April 2006|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref> and a \"dream for a striker\" by teammate [[Thierry Henry]].<ref name=\"Indy\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/there-was-only-one-dennis-bergkamp-408838.html|title=There was only one Dennis Bergkamp|last=Coleman|first=Nick|date=22 July 2006|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=13 December 2011|location=London}}</ref> Bergkamp finished third twice in the [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] award and was selected by [[Pel\u00e9]] as one of the [[FIFA 100]] greatest living players.

Originally a [[Midfielder#Winger|wide midfielder]], Bergkamp was moved to main [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] and then to [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|second striker]], where he remained throughout his playing career. Nicknamed the \"Non-[[Flying Dutchman]]\" by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] supporters due to his [[fear of flying]], Bergkamp is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation.\n\nThe son of an electrician, Bergkamp was born in [[Amsterdam]] and played as an amateur in the lower leagues. He was spotted by Ajax at age 11 and made his professional debut in 1986. Prolific form led to an international call-up with the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] a year later, attracting the attention of several European clubs. Bergkamp signed for Italian club [[Inter Milan]] in 1993, where he had two underwhelming seasons. After joining Arsenal in 1995, he rejuvenated his career, helping the club to win three [[Premier League]] titles, four [[FA Cup]] trophies, and reach the [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final]], which marked his last appearance as a player.\n\nWith the Netherlands national team, Bergkamp was selected for [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 1992]], where he impressed, scoring three goals in the tournament.<ref name=\":0\" /> At the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], he scored a memorable winning goal in the final minute of the quarterfinal against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] which has been regarded as one of the greatest [[FIFA World Cup]] goals.<ref name=\":1\" /> Bergkamp surpassed [[Faas Wilkes]]'s record to become the country's top goalscorer of all time in 1998, a record later eclipsed by [[Patrick Kluivert]], [[Robin van Persie]] and [[Klaas-Jan Huntelaar]].\n\nBergkamp has been described by [[Jan Mulder (footballer)|Jan Mulder]] as having \"the finest technique\" of any Dutch international<ref name=\"Burgcamp\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/017c244e-d6da-11da-b64c-0000779e2340.html#axzz1tS5U1MZp|title=No more walking in a 'Burgcamp' Wonderland|last=Kuper|first=Simon|date=28 April 2006|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref> and a \"dream for a striker\" by teammate [[Thierry Henry]].<ref name=\"Indy\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/there-was-only-one-dennis-bergkamp-408838.html|title=There was only one Dennis Bergkamp|last=Coleman|first=Nick|date=22 July 2006|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=13 December 2011|location=London}}</ref> Bergkamp finished third twice in the [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] award and was selected by [[Pel\u00e9]] as one of the [[FIFA 100]] greatest living players.

Their wing arrangement gives them great maneuverability in flight, and claws and pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces. Flies undergo complete [[metamorphosis]]; the eggs are laid on the larval food-source and the larvae, which lack true limbs, develop in a protected environment, often inside their food source. The pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges when ready to do so; flies mostly have short lives as adults.\n\nDiptera is one of the major insect orders and of considerable [[Ecology|ecological]] and human importance. Flies are important pollinators, second only to the bees and their [[Hymenoptera]]n relatives. Flies may have been among the evolutionarily earliest pollinators responsible for early plant [[pollination]].

Flies can be annoyances especially in some parts of the world where they can occur in large numbers, buzzing and settling on the skin or eyes to bite or seek fluids. Larger flies such as [[tsetse flies]] and [[Cochliomyia|screwworms]] cause significant economic harm to cattle. Blowfly larvae, known as [[Calliphoridae|gentles]], and other dipteran larvae, known more generally as [[maggot]]s, are used as [[fishing bait]] and as food for carnivorous animals.

The [[tsetse fly]] (as well as other Glossinidae, Hippoboscidae, Nycteribidae and Streblidae) exhibits [[adenotrophic viviparity]]; a single fertilised egg is retained in the oviduct and the developing larva feeds on glandular secretions. When fully grown, the female finds a spot with soft soil and the larva works its way out of the oviduct, buries itself and pupates. Some flies like ''[[Lundstroemia parthenogenetica]]'' (Chironomidae) reproduce by [[thelytokous]] [[parthenogenesis]], and some [[gall midge]]s have larvae that can produce eggs ([[paedogenesis]]).<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Mcmahon |first=Dino P. |last2=Hayward |first2=Alexander |date=April 2016 |title=Why grow up?

In some groups, particularly the Nematocera, the pupa is intermediate between the larval and adult form; these pupae are described as \"obtect\", having the future appendages visible as structures that adhere to the pupal body. The outer surface of the pupa may be leathery and bear spines, respiratory features or locomotory paddles. In other groups, described as \"coarctate\", the appendages are not visible. In these, the outer surface is a [[puparium]], formed from the last larval skin, and the actual pupa is concealed within. When the adult insect is ready to emerge from this tough, desiccation-resistant capsule, it inflates a balloon-like structure on its head, and forces its way out.<ref name=Resh/>\n\n=== Adult ===\nThe adult stage is usually short, its function only to mate and lay eggs. The genitalia of male flies are rotated to a varying degree from the position found in other insects.<ref>[http://psyche.entclub.org/48/48-079.html Crampton, G. The TemporalAbdominal Structures of Male Diptera.]</ref> In some flies, this is a temporary rotation during mating, but in others, it is a permanent torsion of the organs that occurs during the pupal stage. This torsion may lead to the [[anus]] being below the genitals, or, in the case of 360\u00b0 torsion, to the sperm duct being wrapped around the gut and the external organs being in their usual position. When flies mate, the male initially flies on top of the female, facing in the same direction, but then turns around to face in the opposite direction. This forces the male to lie on his back for his genitalia to remain engaged with those of the female, or the torsion of the male genitals allows the male to mate while remaining upright. This leads to flies having more reproduction abilities than most insects, and much quicker. Flies occur in large populations due to their ability to mate effectively and quickly during the mating season.<ref name=\"IIBD\" />\n\n==Ecology==\nAs ubiquitous insects, dipterans play an important role at various [[trophic level]]s both as consumers and as prey. In some groups the larvae complete their development without feeding, and in others the adults do not feed. The larvae can be herbivores, scavengers, decomposers, predators or parasites, with the consumption of decaying organic matter being one of the most prevalent feeding behaviours. The fruit or detritus is consumed along with the associated micro-organisms, a sieve-like filter in the pharynx being used to concentrate the particles, while flesh-eating larvae have mouth-hooks to help shred their food. The larvae of some groups feed on or in the living tissues of plants and fungi, and some of these are serious pests of agricultural crops. Some aquatic larvae consume the films of algae that form underwater on rocks and plants. Many of the parasitoid larvae grow inside and eventually kill other arthropods, while parasitic larvae may attack vertebrate hosts.<ref name=Resh/>\n\nWhereas many dipteran larvae are aquatic or live in enclosed terrestrial locations, the majority of adults live above ground and are capable of flight. Predominantly they feed on nectar or plant or animal exudates, such as honeydew, for which their lapping mouthparts are adapted. The flies that feed on vertebrate blood have sharp stylets that pierce the skin, the insects inserting anticoagulant saliva and absorbing the blood that flows; in this process, certain diseases can be transmitted. The bot flies (Oestridae) have evolved to parasitize mammals. Many species complete their life cycle inside the bodies of their hosts.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The World Oestridae (Diptera), Mammals and Continental Drift  |last=Papavero |first=N. |publisher=Springer |year=1977 |isbn= 978-94-010-1308-6|pages= |doi=10.1007/978-94-010-1306-2}}</ref> In many dipteran groups, swarming is a feature of adult life, with clouds of insects gathering in certain locations; these insects are mostly males, and the swarm may serve the purpose of making their location more visible to females.<ref name=Resh/>\n\n===Anti-predator adaptations===\n[[File:Grosser Wollschweber Bombylius major.jpg|thumb|The large bee-fly, ''[[Bombylius major]]'', is a [[Batesian mimicry|Batesian mimic]] of bees.]]\n{{further |Anti-predator adaptation}}\n\nFlies are eaten by other animals at all stages of their development.

Their wing arrangement gives them great maneuverability in flight, and claws and pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces. Flies undergo complete [[metamorphosis]]; the eggs are laid on the larval food-source and the larvae, which lack true limbs, develop in a protected environment, often inside their food source. The pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges when ready to do so; flies mostly have short lives as adults.\n\nDiptera is one of the major insect orders and of considerable [[Ecology|ecological]] and human importance. Flies are important pollinators, second only to the bees and their [[Hymenoptera]]n relatives.

Most dipteran larvae develop in protected environments; many are aquatic and others are found in moist places such as carrion, fruit, vegetable matter, fungi and, in the case of parasitic species, inside their hosts. They tend to have thin cuticles and become desiccated if exposed to the air. Apart from the [[Brachycera]], most dipteran larvae have sclerotinised head capsules, which may be reduced to remnant mouth hooks; the Brachycera, however, have soft, gelatinized head capsules from which the sclerites are reduced or missing.

The [[tsetse fly]] (as well as other Glossinidae, Hippoboscidae, Nycteribidae and Streblidae) exhibits [[adenotrophic viviparity]]; a single fertilised egg is retained in the oviduct and the developing larva feeds on glandular secretions.

In some groups, particularly the Nematocera, the pupa is intermediate between the larval and adult form; these pupae are described as \"obtect\", having the future appendages visible as structures that adhere to the pupal body. The outer surface of the pupa may be leathery and bear spines, respiratory features or locomotory paddles. In other groups, described as \"coarctate\", the appendages are not visible. In these, the outer surface is a [[puparium]], formed from the last larval skin, and the actual pupa is concealed within. When the adult insect is ready to emerge from this tough, desiccation-resistant capsule, it inflates a balloon-like structure on its head, and forces its way out.<ref name=Resh/>\n\n=== Adult ===\nThe adult stage is usually short, its function only to mate and lay eggs. The genitalia of male flies are rotated to a varying degree from the position found in other insects.<ref>[http://psyche.entclub.org/48/48-079.html Crampton, G. The TemporalAbdominal Structures of Male Diptera.]</ref> In some flies, this is a temporary rotation during mating, but in others, it is a permanent torsion of the organs that occurs during the pupal stage. This torsion may lead to the [[anus]] being below the genitals, or, in the case of 360\u00b0 torsion, to the sperm duct being wrapped around the gut and the external organs being in their usual position. When flies mate, the male initially flies on top of the female, facing in the same direction, but then turns around to face in the opposite direction. This forces the male to lie on his back for his genitalia to remain engaged with those of the female, or the torsion of the male genitals allows the male to mate while remaining upright. This leads to flies having more reproduction abilities than most insects, and much quicker. Flies occur in large populations due to their ability to mate effectively and quickly during the mating season.<ref name=\"IIBD\" />\n\n==Ecology==\nAs ubiquitous insects, dipterans play an important role at various [[trophic level]]s both as consumers and as prey. In some groups the larvae complete their development without feeding, and in others the adults do not feed. The larvae can be herbivores, scavengers, decomposers, predators or parasites, with the consumption of decaying organic matter being one of the most prevalent feeding behaviours. The fruit or detritus is consumed along with the associated micro-organisms, a sieve-like filter in the pharynx being used to concentrate the particles, while flesh-eating larvae have mouth-hooks to help shred their food. The larvae of some groups feed on or in the living tissues of plants and fungi, and some of these are serious pests of agricultural crops. Some aquatic larvae consume the films of algae that form underwater on rocks and plants. Many of the parasitoid larvae grow inside and eventually kill other arthropods, while parasitic larvae may attack vertebrate hosts.<ref name=Resh/>\n\nWhereas many dipteran larvae are aquatic or live in enclosed terrestrial locations, the majority of adults live above ground and are capable of flight. Predominantly they feed on nectar or plant or animal exudates, such as honeydew, for which their lapping mouthparts are adapted. The flies that feed on vertebrate blood have sharp stylets that pierce the skin, the insects inserting anticoagulant saliva and absorbing the blood that flows; in this process, certain diseases can be transmitted. The bot flies (Oestridae) have evolved to parasitize mammals. Many species complete their life cycle inside the bodies of their hosts.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The World Oestridae (Diptera), Mammals and Continental Drift  |last=Papavero |first=N. |publisher=Springer |year=1977 |isbn= 978-94-010-1308-6|pages= |doi=10.1007/978-94-010-1306-2}}</ref> In many dipteran groups, swarming is a feature of adult life, with clouds of insects gathering in certain locations; these insects are mostly males, and the swarm may serve the purpose of making their location more visible to females.<ref name=Resh/>\n\n===Anti-predator adaptations===\n[[File:Grosser Wollschweber Bombylius major.jpg|thumb|The large bee-fly, ''[[Bombylius major]]'', is a [[Batesian mimicry|Batesian mimic]] of bees.]]\n{{further |Anti-predator adaptation}}\n\nFlies are eaten by other animals at all stages of their development.

Truman]] to [[Bill Clinton]]{{spaced ndash}}on nuclear policy and was Chairman of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] from 1961 to 1971, where he pushed for commercial [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] and the peaceful applications of nuclear science. Throughout his career, Seaborg worked for arms control. He was a signatory to the [[Franck Report]] and contributed to the [[Limited Test Ban Treaty]], the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] and the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]]. He was a well-known advocate of science education and federal funding for pure research. Toward the end of the [[Eisenhower administration]], he was the principal author of the Seaborg Report on academic science, and, as a member of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[National Commission on Excellence in Education]], he was a key contributor to its 1983 report \"[[A Nation at Risk]]\".\n\nSeaborg was the principal or co-discoverer of ten elements: [[plutonium]], [[americium]], [[curium]], [[berkelium]], [[californium]], [[einsteinium]], [[fermium]], [[mendelevium]], [[nobelium]] and element 106, which, while he was still living, was named [[seaborgium]] in his honor. He also discovered more than 100 [[isotope]]s of transuranium elements and is credited with important contributions to the chemistry of plutonium, originally as part of the [[Manhattan Project]] where he developed the extraction process used to isolate the plutonium fuel for the [[Fat Man|second atomic bomb]]. Early in his career, he was a pioneer in [[nuclear medicine]] and discovered isotopes of elements with important applications in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, including [[iodine-131]], which is used in the treatment of [[thyroid]] disease. In addition to his theoretical work in the development of the actinide concept, which placed the actinide series beneath the [[lanthanide]] series on the periodic table, he postulated the existence of super-heavy elements in the [[transactinide]] and [[superactinide]] series.\n\nAfter sharing the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with [[Edwin McMillan]], he received approximately 50 honorary doctorates and numerous other [[Glenn T.

He  was once listed in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the person with the longest entry in ''[[Who's Who in America]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nGlenn Theodore Seaborg was born in [[Ishpeming, Michigan]], on April 19, 1912, the son of Herman Theodore (Ted) and Selma Olivia Erickson Seaborg. He had one sister, Jeanette, who was two years younger. His family spoke Swedish at home. When Glenn Seaborg was a boy, the family moved to [[Los Angeles County, California]], settling in a subdivision called [[Seaborg Home (South Gate, California)|Home Gardens]], later annexed to the City of [[South Gate, California]]. About this time he changed the spelling of his first name from Glen to Glenn.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=330 }}\n\nSeaborg kept a daily journal from 1927 until he suffered a stroke in 1998.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=336 }} As a youth, Seaborg was both a devoted sports fan and an avid movie buff. His mother encouraged him to become a bookkeeper as she felt his literary interests were impractical.

Oppenheimer had a daunting reputation and often answered a junior colleague's question before it had even been stated. Often the question answered was more profound than the one asked, but of little practical help. Seaborg learned to state his questions to Oppenheimer quickly and succinctly.{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|p=26}}\n\n==Pioneering work in nuclear chemistry==\n[[File:Seaborg in lab - restoration.jpg|thumb|right|Seaborg in 1950, with the [[Ion exchange|ion exchanger]] illusion column of [[actinide]] elements.]]\nSeaborg remained at the University of California, Berkeley, for post-doctoral research. He followed [[Frederick Soddy]]'s work investigating [[isotope]]s and contributed to the discovery of more than 100 isotopes of elements. Using one of Lawrence's advanced cyclotrons, John Livingood, Fred Fairbrother, and Seaborg created a new isotope of iron, [[iron-59]] in 1937. Iron-59 was useful in the studies of the [[hemoglobin]] in human blood. In 1938, Livingood and Seaborg collaborated (as they did for five years) to create an important isotope of [[iodine]], [[iodine-131]], which is still used to treat [[thyroid]] disease.<ref>\n{{Citation\n |last=Heilbron\n |first=J.

In November, he was persuaded to leave Berkeley temporarily to assist with urgent research in [[radar]] technology.

In their experiments bombarding uranium with [[deuteron]]s, they observed the creation of neptunium, element 93. But it then underwent beta-decay, forming a new element, plutonium, with 94 protons. Plutonium is fairly stable, but undergoes alpha-decay, which explained the presence of alpha particles coming from neptunium.<ref name=\"An Elementary Problem\">\n{{cite journal\n |url=http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu/read/spring-2001/an-elementary-problem/\n |last=Farmer |first=Delphine\n |year=2001\n |title=An Elementary Problem\n |journal=Berkeley Science Review\n |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=32\u201337\n |issn=1538-6449\n}}</ref>  Thus, on March 28, 1941, Seaborg, physicist [[Emilio Segr\u00e8]] and Berkeley chemist [[Joseph W.

Seaborg's role was to figure out how to extract the tiny bit of plutonium from the mass of [[uranium]]. Plutonium-239 was isolated in visible amounts using a transmutation reaction on August 20, 1942, and weighed on September 10, 1942, in Seaborg's Chicago laboratory.

Seaborg developed the chemical elements americium and curium while in Chicago. He managed to secure patents for both elements. His patent on curium never proved commercially viable because of the element's short half-life, but americium is commonly used in household [[smoke detectors]] and thus provided a good source of royalty income to Seaborg in later years. Prior to the test of the first nuclear weapon, Seaborg joined with several other leading scientists in a written statement known as the [[Franck Report]] (secret at the time but since published) unsuccessfully calling on President Truman to conduct a public demonstration of the atomic bomb witnessed by the Japanese.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=320, 340\u201343, 348, 354, 369, 377, 395}}\n\n==Professor and Chancellor at the University of California, Berkeley==\n[[File:NNSA-NSO-403.jpg|thumb|right|Seaborg (second from left) during [[Operation Plumbbob]]]]\nAfter the conclusion of World War II and the Manhattan Project, Seaborg was eager to return to academic life and university research free from the restrictions of wartime secrecy. In 1946, he added to his responsibilities as a professor by heading the nuclear chemistry research at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory operated by the University of California on behalf of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. Seaborg was named one of the \"Ten Outstanding Young Men in America\" by the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce in 1947 (along with [[Richard Nixon]] and others).

He rallied a group of scientists who criticized the science curriculum in the state of California, which he viewed as far too socially oriented and not nearly focused enough on hard science.

When Seaborg returned to accompany Griggs for the journey back to Chicago, friends expected them to marry in Chicago.

Truman]] to [[Bill Clinton]]{{spaced ndash}}on nuclear policy and was Chairman of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] from 1961 to 1971, where he pushed for commercial [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] and the peaceful applications of nuclear science. Throughout his career, Seaborg worked for arms control. He was a signatory to the [[Franck Report]] and contributed to the [[Limited Test Ban Treaty]], the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] and the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]]. He was a well-known advocate of science education and federal funding for pure research. Toward the end of the [[Eisenhower administration]], he was the principal author of the Seaborg Report on academic science, and, as a member of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[National Commission on Excellence in Education]], he was a key contributor to its 1983 report \"[[A Nation at Risk]]\".\n\nSeaborg was the principal or co-discoverer of ten elements: [[plutonium]], [[americium]], [[curium]], [[berkelium]], [[californium]], [[einsteinium]], [[fermium]], [[mendelevium]], [[nobelium]] and element 106, which, while he was still living, was named [[seaborgium]] in his honor. He also discovered more than 100 [[isotope]]s of transuranium elements and is credited with important contributions to the chemistry of plutonium, originally as part of the [[Manhattan Project]] where he developed the extraction process used to isolate the plutonium fuel for the [[Fat Man|second atomic bomb]]. Early in his career, he was a pioneer in [[nuclear medicine]] and discovered isotopes of elements with important applications in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, including [[iodine-131]], which is used in the treatment of [[thyroid]] disease. In addition to his theoretical work in the development of the actinide concept, which placed the actinide series beneath the [[lanthanide]] series on the periodic table, he postulated the existence of super-heavy elements in the [[transactinide]] and [[superactinide]] series.\n\nAfter sharing the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with [[Edwin McMillan]], he received approximately 50 honorary doctorates and numerous other [[Glenn T. Seaborg (awards and honors)|awards and honors]]. The [[list of things named after Glenn T. Seaborg|list of things named after Seaborg]] ranges from the chemical element [[seaborgium]] to the asteroid [[4856 Seaborg]]. He was a [[Glenn T. Seaborg (Publications)|prolific author]], penning numerous books and 500 journal articles, often in collaboration with others. He  was once listed in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the person with the longest entry in ''[[Who's Who in America]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nGlenn Theodore Seaborg was born in [[Ishpeming, Michigan]], on April 19, 1912, the son of Herman Theodore (Ted) and Selma Olivia Erickson Seaborg. He had one sister, Jeanette, who was two years younger. His family spoke Swedish at home. When Glenn Seaborg was a boy, the family moved to [[Los Angeles County, California]], settling in a subdivision called [[Seaborg Home (South Gate, California)|Home Gardens]], later annexed to the City of [[South Gate, California]]. About this time he changed the spelling of his first name from Glen to Glenn.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=330 }}\n\nSeaborg kept a daily journal from 1927 until he suffered a stroke in 1998.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=336 }} As a youth, Seaborg was both a devoted sports fan and an avid movie buff. His mother encouraged him to become a bookkeeper as she felt his literary interests were impractical. He did not take an interest in science until his junior year when he was inspired by Dwight Logan Reid, a chemistry and physics teacher at [[Jordan High School (Los Angeles, California)|David Starr Jordan High School]] in [[Watts, Los Angeles, California|Watts]].{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|pp=13\u201314}}\n\nSeaborg graduated from Jordan in 1929 at the top of his class and received a bachelor  of arts (AB) degree in chemistry at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], in 1933.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=330 }} He worked his way through school as a stevedore and a laboratory assistant at [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]].{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|pp=15, 29}} Seaborg received his PhD in chemistry at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1937 with a doctoral thesis on the \"Interaction of Fast Neutrons with Lead\",{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|p=40}}<ref name=\"thesis-seaborg-1937\">{{cite thesis |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/301774846/ |title=The interaction of fast neutrons with lead |date=1937 |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |type=Ph.D. |last=Seaborg |first=Glenn T. |via=[[ProQuest]] |url-access=subscription  |oclc=21609796}}</ref> in which he coined the term \"nuclear [[spallation]]\".<ref name=\"Argonne\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dep.anl.gov/postdocs/seaborg_bio.htm |title=Scientific and Luminary Biography \u2013 Glenn Seaborg |publisher=[[Argonne National Laboratory]] |accessdate=June 16, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nSeaborg was a member of the professional chemistry fraternity [[Alpha Chi Sigma]].

For several years, Seaborg conducted important research in artificial [[radioactivity]] using the Lawrence [[cyclotron]] at UC Berkeley.  He was excited to learn from others that [[nuclear fission]] was possible\u2014but also chagrined, as his own research might have led him to the same discovery.{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|pp=57\u201359}}\n\nSeaborg also became an adept interlocutor of Berkeley physicist [[Robert Oppenheimer]]. Oppenheimer had a daunting reputation and often answered a junior colleague's question before it had even been stated. Often the question answered was more profound than the one asked, but of little practical help. Seaborg learned to state his questions to Oppenheimer quickly and succinctly.{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|p=26}}\n\n==Pioneering work in nuclear chemistry==\n[[File:Seaborg in lab - restoration.jpg|thumb|right|Seaborg in 1950, with the [[Ion exchange|ion exchanger]] illusion column of [[actinide]] elements.]]\nSeaborg remained at the University of California, Berkeley, for post-doctoral research. He followed [[Frederick Soddy]]'s work investigating [[isotope]]s and contributed to the discovery of more than 100 isotopes of elements. Using one of Lawrence's advanced cyclotrons, John Livingood, Fred Fairbrother, and Seaborg created a new isotope of iron, [[iron-59]] in 1937. Iron-59 was useful in the studies of the [[hemoglobin]] in human blood. In 1938, Livingood and Seaborg collaborated (as they did for five years) to create an important isotope of [[iodine]], [[iodine-131]], which is still used to treat [[thyroid]] disease.<ref>\n{{Citation\n |last=Heilbron\n |first=J.

In November, he was persuaded to leave Berkeley temporarily to assist with urgent research in [[radar]] technology.

McMillan agreed to the collaboration.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last=Jackson |first=D. J.\n |last2=Panofsky |first2=W. K.

The first hypothesis for this [[alpha particle]] accumulation was contamination by uranium, which produces alpha-decay particles; analysis of alpha-decay particles ruled this out. Seaborg then postulated that a distinct alpha-producing element was being formed from element 93.<ref name=\"An Elementary Problem\"/>\n\nIn February 1941, Seaborg and his collaborators produced [[plutonium-239]] through the bombardment of uranium. In their experiments bombarding uranium with [[deuteron]]s, they observed the creation of neptunium, element 93. But it then underwent beta-decay, forming a new element, plutonium, with 94 protons. Plutonium is fairly stable, but undergoes alpha-decay, which explained the presence of alpha particles coming from neptunium.<ref name=\"An Elementary Problem\">\n{{cite journal\n |url=http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu/read/spring-2001/an-elementary-problem/\n |last=Farmer |first=Delphine\n |year=2001\n |title=An Elementary Problem\n |journal=Berkeley Science Review\n |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=32\u201337\n |issn=1538-6449\n}}</ref>  Thus, on March 28, 1941, Seaborg, physicist [[Emilio Segr\u00e8]] and Berkeley chemist [[Joseph W.

He shared the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1951 with Edwin McMillan for \"their discoveries in the chemistry of the first transuranium elements.\"<ref name=\"Nobel Prize\"/>\n\n==Scientific contributions during the Manhattan Project==\nOn April 19, 1942, Seaborg reached Chicago and joined the chemistry group at the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] of the Manhattan Project at the [[University of Chicago]], where [[Enrico Fermi]] and his group would later convert [[uranium-238]] to plutonium-239 in a controlled [[nuclear chain reaction]]. Seaborg's role was to figure out how to extract the tiny bit of plutonium from the mass of [[uranium]]. Plutonium-239 was isolated in visible amounts using a transmutation reaction on August 20, 1942, and weighed on September 10, 1942, in Seaborg's Chicago laboratory. He was responsible for the multi-stage chemical process that separated, concentrated and isolated plutonium. This process was further developed at the [[Clinton Engineering Works]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], and then entered full-scale production at the [[Hanford Engineer Works]], in [[Richland, Washington]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title       = Glenn Seaborg's Greatest Hits\n |url         = http://isswprod.lbl.gov/Seaborg/hits.htm\n |publisher   = [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]\n |accessdate  = 2012-08-26\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20041015051852/http://isswprod.lbl.gov/Seaborg/hits.htm\n |archivedate = October 15, 2004\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nSeaborg's theoretical development of the [[actinide concept]] resulted in a redrawing of the Periodic Table of the Elements into its current configuration with the [[actinide series]] appearing below the [[lanthanide series]]. Seaborg developed the chemical elements americium and curium while in Chicago. He managed to secure patents for both elements. His patent on curium never proved commercially viable because of the element's short half-life, but americium is commonly used in household [[smoke detectors]] and thus provided a good source of royalty income to Seaborg in later years. Prior to the test of the first nuclear weapon, Seaborg joined with several other leading scientists in a written statement known as the [[Franck Report]] (secret at the time but since published) unsuccessfully calling on President Truman to conduct a public demonstration of the atomic bomb witnessed by the Japanese.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=320, 340\u201343, 348, 354, 369, 377, 395}}\n\n==Professor and Chancellor at the University of California, Berkeley==\n[[File:NNSA-NSO-403.jpg|thumb|right|Seaborg (second from left) during [[Operation Plumbbob]]]]\nAfter the conclusion of World War II and the Manhattan Project, Seaborg was eager to return to academic life and university research free from the restrictions of wartime secrecy. In 1946, he added to his responsibilities as a professor by heading the nuclear chemistry research at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory operated by the University of California on behalf of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. Seaborg was named one of the \"Ten Outstanding Young Men in America\" by the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce in 1947 (along with [[Richard Nixon]] and others). Seaborg was elected a [[Member of the National Academy of Sciences]] in 1948. From 1954 to 1961 he served as associate director of the radiation laboratory.

Seaborg received a letter dated August 16, 1966, from industry engineers expressing these concerns at the time of the licensing of New York's Indian Point reactor. This letter advised Seaborg and other AEC senior members of these containment concerns which would later become known as the \"China Syndrome\" resulting from uncontained core meltdowns. Seaborg directed this letter not be released to the public as he feared it would be misunderstood and therefore damage the nuclear industry in the public's view, even though the law required such letters be released for public disclosure. This disclosure first came to light for public view in the BBC documentary series, \"Pandora's Box, A Is For Atom\" dealing with the early history of commercial nuclear development. -->\n\nSeaborg enjoyed a close relationship with President [[Lyndon B.

{"title_page": "Refrain (Stockhausen)", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n{{Use Harvard referencing|date=May 2019}}\n[[File:Haus der Kulturen der Welt Nachtaufnahme.jpg|thumb|The [[Haus der Kulturen der Welt|Congresshalle, Berlin]], where ''Refrain'' was premiered in 1959]]\n'''''Refrain''''' for three players (piano with woodblocks, vibraphone with alpine cowbells, and amplified celesta with antique cymbals) is a chamber-music composition by [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], and is number 11 in his catalog of works.\n\n==History==\n''Refrain'' was composed in June and July 1959 on commission from {{Interlanguage link multi|Gerhart von Westerman|de}} for the [[Berliner Festspiele|Berlin Festwochen]], and is dedicated to {{Interlanguage link multi|Ernst Br\u00fccher|de}} {{harv|Stockhausen|1964|loc=101}}. It was premiered on 2 October 1959 by [[David Tudor]] (piano), [[Cornelius Cardew]] (celesta), and a percussionist from the [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] Symphony Orchestra, Siegfried Rockstroh (vibraphone), at the [[Haus der Kulturen der Welt|Berlin Congresshalle]], as part of an all-Stockhausen concert that also included ''[[Kreuzspiel]]'', ''[[Zeitma\u00dfe]]'', ''[[Zyklus]]'', and the [[Klavierst\u00fccke (Stockhausen)|''Klavierst\u00fccke I'', ''IV'', ''V'', ''VII'', ''VIII'', and ''XI'']] {{harv|Kurtz|1992|loc=98}}.\n\n==Materials and form==\nThe title refers to the disturbance six times of a placid and wide-rangingly composed sound texture by a short refrain {{harv|Stockhausen|1964|loc=101}}. These refrains are [[Musical notation|notated]] on a rotatable transparent plastic strip, superimposed on curved staves which allow the refrain to be repositioned in order to introduce these disturbances in different places {{harv|Maconie|2005|loc=188}}.\n\nEach of the three performers plays an accessory instrument in addition to a main instrument. The pianist also plays three [[Woodblock (instrument)|woodblocks]], the celesta is supplemented with three [[Crotales|antique cymbals]], and the vibraphonist has three [[Cowbell (instrument)#Tuned cowbells|alpine cowbells]] coupled with three [[Glockenspiel|glockenspiel bars]]. This means that there are six distinct [[Timbre composition|timbres]] reflecting the pitch structure, which divides the twelve-tone row into two symmetrical six-note cells. This six-element structure is found also in the dynamics, as well as in the durations of both sounds and rests {{harv|Frisius|2008|loc=128}}. The three performers also are required to [[Vocable|vocalise]] [[Click consonant|tongue clicks]] on five approximate pitches and short, sharp phonetic syllables to be pitched near the sounds they play, in a manner reminiscent of [[Theatre of Japan|Japanese theatre]] {{harv|Harvey|1975|loc=87}}. The basic structure of the background layer of the piece consists of a series of chords derived from an all-interval twelve-tone row that Stockhausen used in a number of other works {{harv|Frisius|2008|loc=128\u201330}}.\n\nThe work concludes with a [[coda (music)|coda]], in which the elements are merged into a single complex sound {{harv|Harvey|1975|loc=87\u201388}}.\n\n==Critical reception==\nOn the whole, performances of ''Refrain'' were well-received by the press and public. At an early performance in Venice, although a skeptical reviewer thought \"Stockhausen's ''Refrain'' and ''[[Kontakte (Stockhausen)|Kontakte]]'' seem determined on the disorganization of all conventional musical factors\", he nevertheless reported that the \"concert had a tremendous success, far more than the normal events\" {{harv|Smith Brindle|1960}}. The work's timbres were especially singled out for praise. In a festival report, [[Ben Johnston (composer)|Ben Johnston]] described it as \"jewel-like\" {{harv|Johnston|1963|loc=139}}, and a ''New York Times'' critic found \"its clusters of attractive percussive sounds\" to be \"fresh\" {{harv|Ericson|1964}}. On an all-Stockhausen programme in 1965, the ''Times'' critic found ''Refrain'' the \"most intriguing of all with its blends of keyboard timbre and percussive sound\" {{harv|Anon.|1965}}, and a Los Angeles critic admired its \"highly refined, luminous percussion\" with \"pensive strokes of vibraphone, celesta, and piano six times interrupted and reactivated by the only slightly more dynamic refrain of the title\" {{harv|Peterson|1974}}.\n\nControversy mainly centred on ''Refrain'''s unconventional notation and its relation to the resulting music. In a 1962 review of the printed score, Robert Henderson doubted whether \"there are people with the energy and enthusiasm to work out in detail the precise significance of all these complex signs and then make from them a performance\" and, if there were, whether \"the labour involved could ever be justified by the end-product\", pronouncing it merely \"an amusing musical kaleidescope {{sic}} for those with unlimited amounts of unoccupied time\" {{harv|Henderson|1962}}.\n\nAnother critic initially shared Henderson's reservations but, \"Having heard both these works performed 'live', \u2026 I am moved to add that some of the perplexities mentioned above now seem less puzzling. In fact ''Refrain'' seemed a fascinating and lively performance on stage. \u2026 I was most pleased to discover that the composition 'projected' most successfully\" and \"the live performance was brilliant, convincing, stimulating, perhaps even fathomable\" {{harv|Zimmerman|1963\u201364|loc=241\u201343}}.\n\nAt around this same time, [[Peter Stadlen]] had similarly attacked the notation of ''Refrain'' in a programme on [[BBC Television]]. For this he was scolded by [[Tim Souster]] for having an \"obsession with notation\", while at the same time seeming oblivious of the fact that \"''Refrain'' is one of the finest examples of notation in the history of music\". Souster concluded that <blockquote>One cannot stress too often the importance of letting new music, serial, indeterminate, improvised or electronic, speak directly to the ear, uncluttered by preconceptions or by anxiety about the way the score works. How the music is written down is a very minor consideration to the hundreds of people who fill concerts of Stockhausen's and Cage's music. They respond directly to the audible reality of the music, not to written abstractions, in a way which is all too rare in the critical fraternity. If he trusted his ears, Mr. Stadlen would be a happier man. {{harv|Souster|1969}}</blockquote>\n\nThe highest-profile attack on ''Refrain'', however, was made as part of a political polemic by [[Cornelius Cardew]], who had been Stockhausen's assistant and had played celesta in the world premiere. In 1972 [[Hans Keller]] asked him to introduce a broadcast of the work on BBC Radio and Cardew, a recent convert to [[Marxism]], seized on its comparative popularity as an opportunity to condemn the composition as \"a part of the cultural superstructure of the largest-scale system of human oppression and exploitation the world has ever known: [[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|imperialism]]\" {{harv|Cardew|1974|loc=46}}. Writing in what has been described as \"the most vulgar style of Marxist conventions\" {{harv|Deli\u00e8ge|2003|loc=257}}, Cardew viewed the European avant garde, whose \"abstruse, pseudo-scientific tendencies were encouraged in ivory tower conditions\" as having been by 1959 \"ready to crack from its own internal contradictions\". The leading figures of this group, at the head of which stood Stockhausen, were eager to find a broader audience, and achieving this required change. \"''Refrain'' was probably the first manifestation of this change in Stockhausen\u2019s work. Since then his work has become quite clearly [[Mysticism|mystical]] in character\" {{harv|Cardew|1974|loc=48}}. Because \"Mysticism says 'everything that lives is holy', so don\u2019t walk on the grass and above all don't harm a hair on the head of an imperialist\" {{harv|Cardew|1974|loc=50}}, ''Refrain'' \"is an ally of imperialism and an enemy of the [[Proletariat#Usage in Marxist theory|working and oppressed people]] of the world\", and is comparable with other manifestations of imperialism, specifically \"the British Army in Ireland and the mass of unemployed, for example. Here the brutal character of imperialism is evident. Any beauty that may be detected in ''Refrain'' is merely cosmetic, not even skin-deep\" {{harv|Cardew|1974|loc=55}}.\n\nPublication of the first half of Cardew's lecture in ''The Listener'' \"provoked a storm in its correspondence columns\" {{harv|Cardew|1974|loc=55}} and, as a result of this and a similar attack on [[John Cage]], Cardew reported that \"I temporarily lost my voice at the BBC\". According to his testimony, \"Punishments were also meted out inside the BBC on account of the Stockhausen broadcast which by mischance was heard by a high official of the Corporation\" {{harv|Cardew|1974|loc=34}}.\n\n==Discography==\n* Karlheinz Stockhausen.

In a 1962 review of the printed score, Robert Henderson doubted whether \"there are people with the energy and enthusiasm to work out in detail the precise significance of all these complex signs and then make from them a performance\" and, if there were, whether \"the labour involved could ever be justified by the end-product\", pronouncing it merely \"an amusing musical kaleidescope {{sic}} for those with unlimited amounts of unoccupied time\" {{harv|Henderson|1962}}.\n\nAnother critic initially shared Henderson's reservations but, \"Having heard both these works performed 'live', \u2026 I am moved to add that some of the perplexities mentioned above now seem less puzzling. In fact ''Refrain'' seemed a fascinating and lively performance on stage. \u2026 I was most pleased to discover that the composition 'projected' most successfully\" and \"the live performance was brilliant, convincing, stimulating, perhaps even fathomable\" {{harv|Zimmermann|1963\u201364|loc=241\u201343}}.\n\nAt around this same time, [[Peter Stadlen]] had similarly attacked the notation of ''Refrain'' in a programme on [[BBC Television]]. For this he was scolded by [[Tim Souster]] for having an \"obsession with notation\", while at the same time seeming oblivious of the fact that \"''Refrain'' is one of the finest examples of notation in the history of music\". Souster concluded that <blockquote>One cannot stress too often the importance of letting new music, serial, indeterminate, improvised or electronic, speak directly to the ear, uncluttered by preconceptions or by anxiety about the way the score works. How the music is written down is a very minor consideration to the hundreds of people who fill concerts of Stockhausen's and Cage's music. They respond directly to the audible reality of the music, not to written abstractions, in a way which is all too rare in the critical fraternity. If he trusted his ears, Mr. Stadlen would be a happier man. {{harv|Souster|1969}}</blockquote>\n\nThe highest-profile attack on ''Refrain'', however, was made as part of a political polemic by [[Cornelius Cardew]], who had been Stockhausen's assistant and had played celesta in the world premiere. In 1972 [[Hans Keller]] asked him to introduce a broadcast of the work on BBC Radio and Cardew, a recent convert to [[Marxism]], seized on its comparative popularity as an opportunity to condemn the composition as \"a part of the cultural superstructure of the largest-scale system of human oppression and exploitation the world has ever known: [[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|imperialism]]\" {{harv|Cardew|1974|loc=46}}. Writing in what has been described as \"the most vulgar style of Marxist conventions\" {{harv|Deli\u00e8ge|2003|loc=257}}, Cardew viewed the European avant garde, whose \"abstruse, pseudo-scientific tendencies were encouraged in ivory tower conditions\" as having been by 1959 \"ready to crack from its own internal contradictions\". The leading figures of this group, at the head of which stood Stockhausen, were eager to find a broader audience, and achieving this required change. \"''Refrain'' was probably the first manifestation of this change in Stockhausen\u2019s work. Since then his work has become quite clearly [[Mysticism|mystical]] in character\" {{harv|Cardew|1974|loc=48}}. Because \"Mysticism says 'everything that lives is holy', so don\u2019t walk on the grass and above all don't harm a hair on the head of an imperialist\" {{harv|Cardew|1974|loc=50}}, ''Refrain'' \"is an ally of imperialism and an enemy of the [[Proletariat#Usage in Marxist theory|working and oppressed people]] of the world\", and is comparable with other manifestations of imperialism, specifically \"the British Army in Ireland and the mass of unemployed, for example. Here the brutal character of imperialism is evident. Any beauty that may be detected in ''Refrain'' is merely cosmetic, not even skin-deep\" {{harv|Cardew|1974|loc=55}}.\n\nPublication of the first half of Cardew's lecture in ''The Listener'' \"provoked a storm in its correspondence columns\" {{harv|Cardew|1974|loc=55}} and, as a result of this and a similar attack on [[John Cage]], Cardew reported that \"I temporarily lost my voice at the BBC\". According to his testimony, \"Punishments were also meted out inside the BBC on account of the Stockhausen broadcast which by mischance was heard by a high official of the Corporation\" {{harv|Cardew|1974|loc=34}}.\n\n==Discography==\n* Karlheinz Stockhausen.

The [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers]] (SMPTE) refers to the pattern as '''Engineering Guideline EG 1-1990'''. Its components are a known [[standardization|standard]]. Comparing it as received to the known standard gives video engineers an indication of how an NTSC video [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] has been altered by recording or transmission and what adjustments must be made to bring it back to specification. It is also used for setting a television monitor or receiver to reproduce NTSC [[chrominance]] and [[Luminance (video)|luminance]] information correctly.\n\nThe pattern was originally conceived by Norbert D. Larky and David D. Holmes of RCA Laboratories and first published in RCA Licensee Bulletin LB-819 on February 7, 1951. U.S. patent 2,742,525 Color Test Pattern Generator was awarded on April 17, 1956 to Norbert D. Larky and David D.

In order from left to right, the colors are [[white]], [[yellow]], [[cyan]], [[green]], [[magenta]], [[red]], and [[blue]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://standards.smpte.org/content/eg-1-1990/SEC1.abstract.html?ijkey=98efca5000a1e6d09f037857ce82d60dbcfd0ce6&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha |title=EG 1:1990 Alignment Color Bar Test Signal for Television Picture Monitors}}</ref> This sequence runs through all seven possible combinations that use at least one of the three basic color components of green, red, and blue, with blue cycling on and off between every bar, red cycling on and off every two bars, and green on for the leftmost four bars and off for the rightmost three. Because green contributes the largest share of luminance, followed by red, then blue, this sequence of bars thus appears on a [[waveform monitor]] in luminance mode as a downward staircase from left to right. The [[Oscilloscope#Graticule|graticule]] of a [[vectorscope]] is etched with boxes showing the permissible regions where the traces from these seven bars are supposed to fall if the signal is properly adjusted. \n\nBelow the main set of seven bars is a strip of [[blue]], [[magenta]], [[cyan]], and [[white]] castellations. When a television receiver is set to filter out all colors except for blue, these castellations, combined with the main set of color bars, are used to properly adjust the color controls; they appear as four solid blue bars, with no visible distinction between the bars and the castellations, if the color controls are properly adjusted.\n\nThe bottom section contains a square of 100% intensity white and a rectangle of 7.5% intensity black, for use in setting the luminance range. More modern versions of the pattern feature a \"[[pluge]] pulse.\" The white square lines up so that it is below the yellow and cyan bars, on a waveform monitor this will show up with the white bar overlapping the peak of the yellow and cyan chroma at 100 IRE units. The pluge (short for \"Picture Line-Up Generation Equipment\") pulse is positioned within the black rectangle, below the red bar (it is present in the illustration but may be hard to see). It comprises three small vertical bars, a rightmost one with intensity 4% above black level (11.5 IRE), a middle one with intensity exactly equal to black (7.5 IRE), and a leftmost one with intensity 4% below black (super-black or \"blacker than black\", 3.5 IRE). The pluge pulse aids in adjusting the bottom of the luminance range to avoid either washing out the black tones into grays or collapsing picture information into the signal clipping that occurs a small distance below the black level (known as \"crushing the blacks\"). When a monitor is properly adjusted, the rightmost pluge bar should be just barely visible, while the left two should appear indistinguishable from each other and completely black. Also in the bottom section are two sections that contain -In-phase and +Quadrature signals (see [[YIQ]]), centered on black level and having the same gain as the color burst signal; these show up on the pattern as a square of very dark blue, and a square of very dark purple. On a vectorscope, they appear as two short lines ninety degrees apart. These are used to ensure that the television receiver is properly demodulating the 3.58 [[Megahertz|MHz]] [[NTSC#Chrominance subcarrier|color subcarrier]] portion of the signal. The vectors for the -I and +Q blocks should fall exactly on the I and Q axes on the vectorscope if the chrominance signal is demodulated properly.\n\n[[File:SMPTE bars and tone.ogv|thumb|250px|right|SMPTE color bars with 1kHz [[sine wave]] tone.]]\nThese bars give rise to the former portion of the casual term, \"bars and tone\". Typically, a [[television network]], [[TV station]], or other originator of video programming transmits SMPTE color bars together with a continuous 1000 [[Hertz|Hz]] [[Audio frequency|audio]] [[Pitch (music)|tone]] before sending program material, in order to assert ownership of the transmission line or medium, and so that receiving stations and intermediary telecommunications providers may adjust their equipment. Likewise, producers of television programs typically record \"bars and tone\" at the beginning of a videotape or other recording medium so that the playback equipment can be [[calibration|calibrated]]. Often, the name or [[callsign]] of the TV station, other information such as a real-time clock, or another signal source is graphically superimposed over the bars. \n\nAn alternate form of color bars is the 100% Color Bars pattern, or RGB pattern (sometimes called full field bars), which consists of eight vertical bars of 100% intensity, and does not include the castellation or luminance patterns. Like the SMPTE standard (\"75%\") pattern, the color order is white, yellow, cyan, green, magenta, red, and blue, but with an additional column of saturated black. This pattern is used to check peak color levels and color saturation as well as color alignment. The 100% pattern is not as common or as useful as the SMPTE standard 75% pattern, but many pieces of test equipment generate both patterns, and can be selected to generate either one. Many professional cameras can be set to generate a 100% pattern for calibration to broadcast or recording equipment, especially in a multi-camera installation where all camera signals must match. There is another 75% pattern that consists of the same eight columns as the 100% pattern, but at 75% intensity. This pattern is very seldom used.\n\nAlthough color bars were originally designed to calibrate analog NTSC equipment, they remain widely used within modern digital television facilities. Color bars are used to maintain accurate chroma and luminance levels in CRT, LCD, plasma, and other video displays, as well as duplication, television and webcast equ\u0131pment.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers]] (SMPTE) refers to the pattern as '''Engineering Guideline EG 1-1990'''. Its components are a known [[standardization|standard]]. Comparing it as received to the known standard gives video engineers an indication of how an NTSC video [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] has been altered by recording or transmission and what adjustments must be made to bring it back to specification. It is also used for setting a television monitor or receiver to reproduce NTSC [[chrominance]] and [[Luminance (video)|luminance]] information correctly.\n\nThe pattern was originally conceived by Norbert D. Larky and David D. Holmes of RCA Laboratories and first published in RCA Licensee Bulletin LB-819 on February 7, 1951. U.S. patent 2,742,525 Color Test Pattern Generator was awarded on April 17, 1956 to Norbert D. Larky and David D.

In order from left to right, the colors are [[white]], [[yellow]], [[cyan]], [[green]], [[magenta]], [[red]], and [[blue]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://standards.smpte.org/content/eg-1-1990/SEC1.abstract.html?ijkey=98efca5000a1e6d09f037857ce82d60dbcfd0ce6&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha |title=EG 1:1990 Alignment Color Bar Test Signal for Television Picture Monitors}}</ref> This sequence runs through all seven possible combinations that use at least one of the three basic color components of green, red, and blue, with blue cycling on and off between every bar, red cycling on and off every two bars, and green on for the leftmost four bars and off for the rightmost three. Because green contributes the largest share of luminance, followed by red, then blue, this sequence of bars thus appears on a [[waveform monitor]] in luminance mode as a downward staircase from left to right. The [[Oscilloscope#Graticule|graticule]] of a [[vectorscope]] is etched with boxes showing the permissible regions where the traces from these seven bars are supposed to fall if the signal is properly adjusted. \n\nBelow the main set of seven bars is a strip of [[blue]], [[magenta]], [[cyan]], and [[white]] castellations. When a television receiver is set to filter out all colors except for blue, these castellations, combined with the main set of color bars, are used to properly adjust the color controls; they appear as four solid blue bars, with no visible distinction between the bars and the castellations, if the color controls are properly adjusted.\n\nThe bottom section contains a square of 100% intensity white and a rectangle of 7.5% intensity black, for use in setting the luminance range. More modern versions of the pattern feature a \"[[pluge]] pulse.\" The white square lines up so that it is below the yellow and cyan bars, on a waveform monitor this will show up with the white bar overlapping the peak of the yellow and cyan chroma at 100 IRE units. The pluge (short for \"Picture Line-Up Generation Equipment\") pulse is positioned within the black rectangle, below the red bar (it is present in the illustration but may be hard to see). It comprises three small vertical bars, a rightmost one with intensity 4% above black level (11.5 IRE), a middle one with intensity exactly equal to black (7.5 IRE), and a leftmost one with intensity 4% below black (super-black or \"blacker than black\", 3.5 IRE). The pluge pulse aids in adjusting the bottom of the luminance range to avoid either washing out the black tones into grays or collapsing picture information into the signal clipping that occurs a small distance below the black level (known as \"crushing the blacks\"). When a monitor is properly adjusted, the rightmost pluge bar should be just barely visible, while the left two should appear indistinguishable from each other and completely black. Also in the bottom section are two sections that contain -In-phase and +Quadrature signals (see [[YIQ]]), centered on black level and having the same gain as the color burst signal; these show up on the pattern as a square of very dark blue, and a square of very dark purple. On a vectorscope, they appear as two short lines ninety degrees apart. These are used to ensure that the television receiver is properly demodulating the 3.58 [[Megahertz|MHz]] [[NTSC#Chrominance subcarrier|color subcarrier]] portion of the signal. The vectors for the -I and +Q blocks should fall exactly on the I and Q axes on the vectorscope if the chrominance signal is demodulated properly.\n\n[[File:SMPTE bars and tone.ogv|thumb|250px|right|SMPTE color bars with 1kHz [[sine wave]] tone.]]\nThese bars give rise to the former portion of the casual term, \"bars and tone\". Typically, a [[television network]], [[TV station]], or other originator of video programming transmits SMPTE color bars together with a continuous 1000 [[Hertz|Hz]] [[Audio frequency|audio]] [[Pitch (music)|tone]] before sending program material, in order to assert ownership of the transmission line or medium, and so that receiving stations and intermediary telecommunications providers may adjust their equipment. Likewise, producers of television programs typically record \"bars and tone\" at the beginning of a videotape or other recording medium so that the playback equipment can be [[calibration|calibrated]]. Often, the name or [[callsign]] of the TV station, other information such as a real-time clock, or another signal source is graphically superimposed over the bars. \n\nAn alternate form of color bars is the 100% Color Bars pattern, or RGB pattern (sometimes called full field bars), which consists of eight vertical bars of 100% intensity, and does not include the castellation or luminance patterns. Like the SMPTE standard (\"75%\") pattern, the color order is white, yellow, cyan, green, magenta, red, and blue, but with an additional column of saturated black. This pattern is used to check peak color levels and color saturation as well as color alignment. The 100% pattern is not as common or as useful as the SMPTE standard 75% pattern, but many pieces of test equipment generate both patterns, and can be selected to generate either one. Many professional cameras can be set to generate a 100% pattern for calibration to broadcast or recording equipment, especially in a multi-camera installation where all camera signals must match. There is another 75% pattern that consists of the same eight columns as the 100% pattern, but at 75% intensity. This pattern is very seldom used.\n\nAlthough color bars were originally designed to calibrate analog NTSC equipment, they remain widely used within modern digital television facilities. Color bars are used to maintain accurate chroma and luminance levels in CRT, LCD, plasma, and other video displays, as well as duplication, television and webcast equ\u0131pment.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Because the First Nations people did most of the work of beaver hunting, the company needed few French employees. But the severely underpopulated New France almost fell completely to hostile Iroquois forces. In 1660, settler [[Adam Dollard des Ormeaux]] led a Canadian and Huron [[militia]] against a much larger Iroquois force; none of the Canadians survived, but they succeeded in turning back the Iroquois invasion. In 1627, Quebec had only eighty-five French colonists and was easily overwhelmed two years later when three English privateers plundered the settlement. In 1663, New France finally became more secure when [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] made it a royal province, taking control away from the [[Company of One Hundred Associates]].

In 1665, [[Jean Talon]] was sent by Minister of the Marine [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] to New France as the first Intendant. These reforms limited the power of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec|Bishop of Quebec]], who had held the greatest amount of power after the death of Champlain.\n\nThe [[1666 census of New France]] was conducted by France's intendant, Jean Talon, in the winter of 1665\u201366.

Approximately 800 arrived during 1663\u20131673. The King's Daughters found husbands among the male settlers within a year or two, as well as a new life for themselves. They came on their own choice, many because they could not make a favorable marriage in the social hierarchy in France. They were from commoner families in the Paris area, Normandy and the central-western regions of France.

It achieved this in great part due to its particular location along the [[St. Lawrence River]]. From here a new economy emerged, one of size and density that provided increased economic opportunities for the inhabitants of New France. In December 1627 the [[Company of New France]] was recognized and given commercial rights to the gathering and export of [[furs]] from French territories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Adair |first=E.

As a result, it was able to set specific price points for furs and other valuable goods, often doing so to protect its economic hegemony over other trading partners and other areas of the economy.\n\nThe fur trade itself was based on a [[commodity]] of small bulk but yet high value. Because of this it managed to attract increased attention and/or input capital that would otherwise be intended for other areas of the economy. The Montreal area witnessed a stagnant agricultural sector; it remained for the most part subsistence orientated with little or no trade purposes outside of the French [[colony]]. This was a prime example of the handicapping effect the [[fur trade]] had on its neighbouring areas of the [[economy]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Innis |first=H.A. |title=Significant Factors in Canadian Economic Development |journal=Canadian Historical Review |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=374\u2013384 |date=1937 |doi=10.3138/CHR-018-04-02}}</ref>\n\nNonetheless, by the beginning of the 1700s the economic prosperity the fur trade stimulated slowly transformed Montreal. Economically, it was no longer a town of small traders or of fur fairs but rather a city of merchants and of bright lights. The primary sector of the [[fur trade]], the act of acquiring and the selling of the furs, quickly promoted the growth of complementary second and tertiary sectors of the economy. For instance a small number of tanneries was established in Montreal as well as a larger number of inns, taverns and markets that would support the growing number of inhabitants whose livelihood depended on the fur trade. Already by 1683 there were well over 140 families and there may have been as many as 900 people living in Montreal.\n\nThe founding of the [[Compagnie des Indes]] in 1718, once again highlighted the economic importance of the fur trade.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wien |first=Thomas |url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/jcha/1990/v1/n1/031021ar.pdf |title=Selling Beaver Skins in North America and Europe, 1720\u20131760: The Uses of Fur-Trade Imperialism |journal=Journal of the Canadian Historical Association |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=1990 |pp=293\u2013317 |doi=10.7202/031021ar}}</ref> This merchant association, like its predecessor the Compagnie des Cent Associes, regulated the fur trade to the best of its abilities imposing price points, supporting government sale taxes and combating black market practices.

This eventually resulted in the repeal of the 25 percent sales tax that had previously aimed at curbing the administrative costs New France had accumulated. In addition, dwindling supply increased black market trading. A greater number of indigenous groups and fur traders began circumventing [[Montreal]] and New France altogether; many began trading with either [[United Kingdom|British]] or [[Netherlands|Dutch]] merchants to the south.<ref name = \"illegalfurtrade\"/>\n\nBy the end of French rule in New France in 1763, the fur trade had significantly lost its importance as the key stable good that supported much of New France's economy for more than the last century. Even so, it did serve as the fundamental force behind the establishment and vast growth of Montreal and the French colony.\n\n===Coureurs des bois and voyageurs===\n[[File:Arrival of Radisson in an Indian camp 1660 Charles William Jefferys.jpg|thumb|The arrival of [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson|Radisson]] in an Amerindian camp in 1660]]\nThe [[coureurs des bois]] were responsible for starting the flow of trade from [[Montreal]], carrying [[France|French]] goods into upper territories while indigenous people were bringing down their [[furs]]. The coureurs traveled with intermediate trading tribes, and found that they were anxious to prevent French access to the more distant fur-hunting tribes. Still, the coureurs kept thrusting outwards using the [[Ottawa River]] as their initial step upon the journey and keeping Montreal as their starting point.<ref name=\"Rich, E. E. 1966\"/> The Ottawa River was significant because it offered a route that was practical for Europeans, by taking the traders northward out of the territory dominated by the [[Iroquois]]. It was for this reason that Montreal and the Ottawa River was a central location of indigenous warfare and rivalry.\n\nMontreal faced difficulties by having too many coureurs out in the woods. The furs coming down were causing an oversupply on the markets of [[Europe]]. This challenged the coureurs trade because they so easily evaded controls, monopolies, and taxation, and additionally because the coureurs trade was held to debauch both French and various indigenous groups. The coureur debauched Frenchmen by accustoming them to fully live with indigenous, and indigenous by trading on their desire for alcohol.<ref name=\"Rich, E. E. 1966\"/>\n\nThe issues caused a great rift in the [[colony]], and in 1678, it was confirmed by a General Assembly that the trade was to be made in public so as to better assure the safety of the indigenous population. It was also forbidden to take spirits inland to trade with indigenous groups. However these restrictions on the coureurs, for a variety of reasons, never worked. The [[fur trade]] remained dependent on spirits, and increasingly in the hands of the coureurs who journeyed north in search of furs.<ref name=\"Rich, E. E. 1966\"/>\n\nAs time passed, the Coureurs des bois were partially replaced by licensed fur trading endeavors, and the main canoe travel workers of those endeavors were called [[voyageurs]].\n\n===Indigenous peoples===\n[[File:Woodlands Shirt, c. 1720-1750.jpg|thumb|Leather Shirt, c. 1720\u20131750.

Made of antelope hide, the interlocking abstract painted designs probably represent the sacred [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderbird]].]]\nThe [[French people|French]] were interested in exploiting the land through the fur trade as well as the timber trade later on. Despite having tools and guns, the French settlers were dependent on Indigenous people to survive in the difficult climate in this part of North America. Many settlers did not know how to survive through the winter; the Indigenous people showed them how to survive in the New World. They showed the settlers how to hunt for food and to use the furs for clothing that would protect them during the winter months.<ref>{{cite book |last=Friders |first=James S. |title=Native Peoples in Canada: Contemporary Conflicts |location=Scarborough: Ontario |publisher=Prentice-Hall Canada |date=1993 |isbn=978-0-1301-2204-9}}</ref>\n\nAs the fur trade became the dominant economy in the New World, French voyageurs, trappers and hunters often married or formed relationships with Indigenous women. This allowed the French to develop relations with their wives' Indigenous nations, which in turn provided protection and access to their hunting and trapping grounds.\n\nThe fur trade benefited Indigenous people as well. They traded furs for metal tools and other European made items that made their lives easier. Tools such as knives, pots and kettles, nets, firearms and hatchets improved the general welfare of indigenous peoples. At the same time, while everyday life became easier, some traditional ways of doing things were abandoned or altered, and while Indigenous people embraced many of these implements and tools, they also were exposed to less vital trade goods, such as alcohol and sugar, sometimes with deleterious effect.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carlos |first1=Ann M. |last2=Lewis |first2=Frank D. |title=Commerce by Frozen Sea: Native Americans and the European Fur Trade |location=Philadelphia |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0812204827 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wjc34n1z8pYC&pg=PP1}}</ref>\n\n===Formal entry of England in New France area fur trade===\n[[File:Claude Bernou Carte de lAmerique septentrionale.jpg|thumb|1681 French map of the New World above the equator: New France and the [[Great Lakes]] in the north, with a dark line as the [[Mississippi River]] to the west in the [[Illinois Country]] and the mouth of the river (and future New Orleans) then ''[[terra incognita]]'']]\n\nSince [[Henry Hudson]] had claimed [[Hudson Bay]], and the surrounding lands for England in 1611, English colonists had begun expanding their boundaries across what is now the [[Canada|Canadian]] north beyond the French-held territory of New France.

The French forces went on the attack first in a failed attempt to capture [[Annapolis Royal]], the capital of the British Nova Scotia. In 1745, [[William Shirley]], governor of [[Massachusetts]], led a counterattack on Louisbourg. Both France and New France were unable to relieve the siege, and Louisbourg fell to the British. With the famed [[Duc d'Anville Expedition]], France attempted to retake Acadia and the fortress in 1746 but failed.

A small colonial force from Virginia began a fort here, but a French force under [[Claude-Pierre P\u00e9caudy de Contrec\u0153ur]] drove them off in April 1754. New France claimed this as part of their colony, and the French were anxious to keep the British from encroaching on it. The French built Fort Duquesne here to serve as a military stronghold and as a base for developing trade and strengthening military alliances with the indigenous peoples of the area.\n\nIn 1755, General [[Edward Braddock]] led [[Braddock Expedition|an expedition]] against Fort Duquesne, and although they were numerically superior to the French militia and their Indian allies, Braddock's army was routed and Braddock was killed.<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/9580/ |title=The Battle of the Monongahela |website=[[World Digital Library]] |date=1755 |accessdate=22 February 2016}}</ref> Later that same year at the Battle of Lake George, the British General William Johnson with a force of 1700 American and Iroquois troops defeated a French force of 2800 French and Canadians and 700 [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] led by Baron Dieskau (Military commander of New France).\n\nThe fight for control over Ohio Country led to the [[French and Indian War]], which began as the North American phase of the [[Seven Years' War]] (which did not technically begin in Europe until 1756). The war began with the defeat of a Virginia militia contingent led by Colonel [[George Washington]] by the French [[troupes de la marine]] in the [[Ohio Country|Ohio valley]]. As a result of that defeat, the British decided to prepare the conquest of Quebec City, the capital of New France. The British defeated France in Acadia in the [[Battle of Fort Beausejour]] (1755) and then [[\u00cele Royale (New France)|\u00cele Royale]] ([[Cape Breton Island]]) (which also administered \u00cele Saint-Jean ([[Prince Edward Island]]) with the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)]].\n\nThroughout the war, the British forcibly removed the Acadians from their lands, which the Mi'kmaq and Acadian militias resisted. The [[Expulsion of the Acadians|Great Upheaval]] continued from 1755 to 1764.\n\nThese British military successes were resisted, with successes by the French and Native Americans. In 1756, a large force of French, Canadians, and their Native American allies led by Marquis de Montcalm launched an attack against the key British post at Fort Oswego on Lake Ontario from Fort Frontenac and forced the garrison to surrender. The following year Montcalm with a huge force of 7200 French and Canadians and 2400 Native Americans laid siege to Fort William Henry on the southern shores of Lake George, and after three weeks of fighting the British commander Monroe surrendered. Montcalm gave him honorable terms to return to England and not to fight for 18 months. But many of the Native Americans were hungry for scalps and loot, so when the British force with civilians were three miles from the fort they massacred about 1100 of the 1500 strong force.\n\nThe following year the French had one victory and one defeat. The defeat was at the French fortress city of Louisbourg. The victory was at the strip of land between Lake Champlain and Lake George at the French fortress of Fort Carillon. The British force sent to capture Fort Carillon (held by just 3400 French regulars and marines with almost no militia or indigenous support) was the largest ever seen in America at that time: 16,200 British, American, and Iroquois troops under the command of General James Abercrombie. This battle cost the British 2200 troops, several artillery pieces against French losses of around 200 killed or wounded.\n\nWhile the British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Conquest of Acadia]] happened in 1710, the French continued to remain a significant force in the region with [[Fort Beausejour]] and [[Fortress Louisbourg]]. The dominant population in the region remained Acadian, that is to say, not British. In 1755, the British were successful in the [[Battle of Beausejour]] and immediately after began the [[expulsion of the Acadians]]. \n\nIn the meantime the French continued to explore westwards and expand their trade alliances with indigenous peoples. [[Fort de la Corne]] was built in 1753, by [[Louis de la Corne, Chevalier de la Corne]] just east of the [[Saskatchewan River Forks]] in what is today the Canadian province of [[Saskatchewan]]. This was the furthest westward outpost of the French Empire in North America to be established before its fall.\n\n==Treaties of cession==\n{{further|Conquest of New France (1758-1760)}}\nIn 1758, British forces again [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|captured Louisbourg]], allowing them to blockade the entrance to the St. Lawrence River. This proved decisive in the war. In 1759, the British besieged Quebec by sea, and an army under General [[James Wolfe]] defeated the French under General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]] at the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] in September. The garrison in Quebec surrendered on 18 September, and by the next year New France had been conquered by the British after [[Montreal Campaign|the attack on Montreal]], which had refused to acknowledge the fall of Canada. The last French governor-general of New France, [[Pierre Fran\u00e7ois de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal]], surrendered to British Major General [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery Amherst]] on 8 September 1760.

The [[Louisiana Territory]], under [[Spain|Spanish]] control since the end of the Seven Years' War, remained off-limits to settlement from the thirteen American colonies.\n\nTwelve years after the British defeated the French, the [[American Revolutionary War]] broke out in the Thirteen Colonies. Many French Canadians would take part in the war, including Major [[Cl\u00e9ment Gosselin]] and Admiral [[Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil]]. After the British surrender at [[Battle of Yorktown (1781)|Yorktown]] in 1781, the [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)|Treaty of Versailles]] gave all former British claims in New France below the [[Great Lakes]] into the possession of the nascent [[United States]]. A Franco-Spanish alliance treaty returned Louisiana to France in 1801, but French leader [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] sold it to the United States in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, ending French colonial efforts in North America.\n\nThe portions of the former New France that remained under British rule were administered as [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]], 1791\u20131841, and then those regions were merged as the [[Province of Canada]] during 1841\u20131867, when the passage of the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act of 1867]] instituted [[home rule]] for most of British North America and established French-speaking Quebec (the former Lower Canada) as one of the original provinces of the [[Confederation of Canada|Dominion of Canada]]. The former French colony of Acadia was first designated the [[Colony of Nova Scotia]] but shortly thereafter the [[Colony of New Brunswick]], which then included Prince Edward Island, was split off from it.\n\nIn Canada, the legacy of New France can be seen in the enduring [[Canadian identity#French Canadians and Identity in English Canada|Francophone identity]] of its descendants, which has led to [[Bilingualism in Canada|institutional bilingualism]] in Canada as a whole.\n\nThe only remnant of the former colonial territory of New France that remains under French control to this day is the French [[overseas collectivity]] of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] (French: Collectivit\u00e9 territoriale de Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon), consisting of a group of small islands {{convert|25|km|mi nmi}} off the coast of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], Canada.\n\n==Political divisions of New France==\n[[File:Constitution-of-new-france-1759.png|thumb|A chart showing the political organization of New France, c. 1759]]\nThe territory of New France was divided into five colonies, each with its own administration: [[Canada (New France)|Canada]], Hudson's Bay, [[Acadia]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] [[Placentia, Newfoundland and Labrador|(Plaisance)]], and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]].<ref name=Francis2009 /><ref name=Territoire /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://slmc.uottawa.ca/?q=canada_new_france |title=Canada at the Time of New France  |date=2004  |author=University of Ottawa |accessdate= March 24, 2017}}</ref> The Treaty of Utrecht resulted in the relinquishing of French claims to mainland Acadia, the Hudson Bay and Newfoundland, and the establishment of the colony of [[Cape Breton Island|\u00cele Royale]], now called Cape Breton Island, where the French built the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]].<ref name=Johnston2001 /><ref name=Louisbourg /> Acadia had a difficult history, with the [[Expulsion of the Acadians|Great Upheaval]], remembered on [[Royal Proclamation of 2003|July 28]] each year since 2003. The [[Acadians|descendants]] are dispersed in the Maritime Provinces of Canada, in Maine and Louisiana in the United States, with small populations in [[Ch\u00e9ticamp, Nova Scotia]] and the [[Magdalen Islands#History|Magdalen Islands]].\n\nIn terms of 21st century political divisions and nations, New France included Acadia (eastern Quebec, the coastal territories, and claims to New England as far as Philadelphia, Canada (modern eastern Canada and the Canadian plains in central Canada to the edge of modern-day Alberta), and Louisiana (a vast territory stretching across much of the east half of modern Midwestern United States).\n\n* [[Acadia|Province of Acadia]]\n* [[Canada (New France)|Canada]]\n** [[Illinois Country]] (before 1717)\n* [[French Louisiana]]\n** Illinois Country (after 1717)\n\n==Historiography==\nThe Conquest (referring to the fall of New France to the British, and specifically the events of 1759-60) has always been a central and contested theme of Canadian memory. Some Anglophone historians portray the Conquest as a victory for \"British military, political and economic superiority\" and argue that it ultimately brought benefits to the French settlers.<ref name=Jaenen/> However, Cornelius Jaenen notes that French-Canadian historians remain strongly divided on the subject. One group sees it as a highly negative economic, political and ideological disaster that threatened a way of life with materialism and Protestantism. At the other pole are those historians who see the positive benefit of enabling the preservation of language, and religion and traditional customs under British rule.<ref name=Jaenen>{{cite book |last=Jaenen |first=Cornelius J. |title=Canada during the French regime |editor-last=Muise |editor-first=D.A. |work=A Reader's Guide to Canadian History: Volume 1: Beginnings to Confederation |year=1982 |page=[https://archive.org/details/readersguidetoca0000unse/page/40 40] |isbn=978-0-8020-6442-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/readersguidetoca0000unse/page/40 }}</ref> French-Canadian debates have escalated since the 1960s, as the conquest is seen as a pivotal moment in the history of Qu\u00e9bec's nationalism. Francophone historian Jocelyn L\u00e9tourneau suggested in 2009, that today, \"1759 does not belong primarily to a past that we might wish to study and understand, but, rather, to a present and a future that we might wish to shape and control.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Jocelyn |last=L\u00e9tourneau |title=What is to be done with 1759? |editor-first1=Phillip |editor-last1=Buckner |editor-last2=Reid |editor-first2=John G. |work=Remembering 1759: The Conquest of Canada in Historical Memory |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2012 |page=279 |isbn=978-1-4426-9924-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yiOOuORbGpAC&pg=PA279}}</ref>\n\nThe enduring contestation of the legacy of the Conquest can be exemplified by an episode in 2009, when an attempt to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the battle of the Plains of Abraham was cancelled. The explanation for the cancellation was that it was over security concerns, but activist Sylvain Rocheleau stated, \"[I think] they had to cancel the event because it was insulting a majority of Francophones.

Because the First Nations people did most of the work of beaver hunting, the company needed few French employees. But the severely underpopulated New France almost fell completely to hostile Iroquois forces. In 1660, settler [[Adam Dollard des Ormeaux]] led a Canadian and Huron [[militia]] against a much larger Iroquois force; none of the Canadians survived, but they succeeded in turning back the Iroquois invasion. In 1627, Quebec had only eighty-five French colonists and was easily overwhelmed two years later when three English privateers plundered the settlement.

In 1665, [[Jean Talon]] was sent by Minister of the Marine [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] to New France as the first Intendant. These reforms limited the power of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec|Bishop of Quebec]], who had held the greatest amount of power after the death of Champlain.\n\nThe [[1666 census of New France]] was conducted by France's intendant, Jean Talon, in the winter of 1665\u201366.

Approximately 800 arrived during 1663\u20131673. The King's Daughters found husbands among the male settlers within a year or two, as well as a new life for themselves. They came on their own choice, many because they could not make a favorable marriage in the social hierarchy in France. They were from commoner families in the Paris area, Normandy and the central-western regions of France.

During the 16th and early 17th centuries New France's economy was heavily centered on its [[Atlantic]] fisheries. This would change in the later half of the 17th and 18th centuries as [[France|French]] settlement penetrated further into the continental interior.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Watkins |first=Melville H. |title=A Staple Theory of Economic Growth |journal=The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=141\u2013158 |date=May 1963 |jstor=139461 |doi=10.2307/139461}}</ref> Here French economic interests would shift and concentrate itself on the development of the [[North American fur trade]]. It would soon become the new staple good that would strengthen and drive New France's economy, in particular that of [[Montreal]], for the next century.\n\n[[File:Beaver wars map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Map showing the approximate location of major tribes and settlements<ref>{{cite book |last=Jennings |first=Francis |title=The Ambiguous Iroquois Empire |year=1984 |isbn=978-0-393-01719-9 |publisher=W.

It achieved this in great part due to its particular location along the [[St. Lawrence River]]. From here a new economy emerged, one of size and density that provided increased economic opportunities for the inhabitants of New France. In December 1627 the [[Company of New France]] was recognized and given commercial rights to the gathering and export of [[furs]] from French territories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Adair |first=E. R. |url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/ram/1942/v21/n1/300228ar.pdf |title=The Evolution of Montreal under the French Regime |journal=Report of the Annual Meeting of the Canadian Historical Association |volume=21 |issue=1 |date=1942 |pp=20\u201341 |doi=10.7202/300228ar}}</ref> By trading with various indigenous populations and securing the main markets its power grew steadily for the next decade. As a result, it was able to set specific price points for furs and other valuable goods, often doing so to protect its economic hegemony over other trading partners and other areas of the economy.\n\nThe fur trade itself was based on a [[commodity]] of small bulk but yet high value. Because of this it managed to attract increased attention and/or input capital that would otherwise be intended for other areas of the economy. The Montreal area witnessed a stagnant agricultural sector; it remained for the most part subsistence orientated with little or no trade purposes outside of the French [[colony]]. This was a prime example of the handicapping effect the [[fur trade]] had on its neighbouring areas of the [[economy]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Innis |first=H.A. |title=Significant Factors in Canadian Economic Development |journal=Canadian Historical Review |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=374\u2013384 |date=1937 |doi=10.3138/CHR-018-04-02}}</ref>\n\nNonetheless, by the beginning of the 1700s the economic prosperity the fur trade stimulated slowly transformed Montreal. Economically, it was no longer a town of small traders or of fur fairs but rather a city of merchants and of bright lights. The primary sector of the [[fur trade]], the act of acquiring and the selling of the furs, quickly promoted the growth of complementary second and tertiary sectors of the economy. For instance a small number of tanneries was established in Montreal as well as a larger number of inns, taverns and markets that would support the growing number of inhabitants whose livelihood depended on the fur trade. Already by 1683 there were well over 140 families and there may have been as many as 900 people living in Montreal.\n\nThe founding of the [[Compagnie des Indes]] in 1718, once again highlighted the economic importance of the fur trade.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wien |first=Thomas |url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/jcha/1990/v1/n1/031021ar.pdf |title=Selling Beaver Skins in North America and Europe, 1720\u20131760: The Uses of Fur-Trade Imperialism |journal=Journal of the Canadian Historical Association |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=1990 |pp=293\u2013317 |doi=10.7202/031021ar}}</ref> This merchant association, like its predecessor the Compagnie des Cent Associes, regulated the fur trade to the best of its abilities imposing price points, supporting government sale taxes and combating black market practices. However, by the middle half of the 18th century the [[fur trade]] was in a slow decline.<ref name = \"illegalfurtrade\">{{cite journal |last=Lunn |first=Jean |url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/ram/1939/v18/n1/300187ar.pdf |title=The Illegal Fur Trade out of New France, 1713\u201360 |journal=Report of the Annual Meeting of the Canadian Historical Association / Rapports Annuels de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Historique du Canada |volume=18 |number=1 |year=1939 |pages=61\u201376 |issn=0317-0594 |accessdate=20 February 2012 |doi=10.7202/300187ar}}</ref>\n\nThe natural abundance of furs had passed and it could no longer meet market demand. This eventually resulted in the repeal of the 25 percent sales tax that had previously aimed at curbing the administrative costs New France had accumulated. In addition, dwindling supply increased black market trading. A greater number of indigenous groups and fur traders began circumventing [[Montreal]] and New France altogether; many began trading with either [[United Kingdom|British]] or [[Netherlands|Dutch]] merchants to the south.<ref name = \"illegalfurtrade\"/>\n\nBy the end of French rule in New France in 1763, the fur trade had significantly lost its importance as the key stable good that supported much of New France's economy for more than the last century. Even so, it did serve as the fundamental force behind the establishment and vast growth of Montreal and the French colony.\n\n===Coureurs des bois and voyageurs===\n[[File:Arrival of Radisson in an Indian camp 1660 Charles William Jefferys.jpg|thumb|The arrival of [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson|Radisson]] in an Amerindian camp in 1660]]\nThe [[coureurs des bois]] were responsible for starting the flow of trade from [[Montreal]], carrying [[France|French]] goods into upper territories while indigenous people were bringing down their [[furs]]. The coureurs traveled with intermediate trading tribes, and found that they were anxious to prevent French access to the more distant fur-hunting tribes. Still, the coureurs kept thrusting outwards using the [[Ottawa River]] as their initial step upon the journey and keeping Montreal as their starting point.<ref name=\"Rich, E. E. 1966\"/> The Ottawa River was significant because it offered a route that was practical for Europeans, by taking the traders northward out of the territory dominated by the [[Iroquois]]. It was for this reason that Montreal and the Ottawa River was a central location of indigenous warfare and rivalry.\n\nMontreal faced difficulties by having too many coureurs out in the woods. The furs coming down were causing an oversupply on the markets of [[Europe]]. This challenged the coureurs trade because they so easily evaded controls, monopolies, and taxation, and additionally because the coureurs trade was held to debauch both French and various indigenous groups. The coureur debauched Frenchmen by accustoming them to fully live with indigenous, and indigenous by trading on their desire for alcohol.<ref name=\"Rich, E. E. 1966\"/>\n\nThe issues caused a great rift in the [[colony]], and in 1678, it was confirmed by a General Assembly that the trade was to be made in public so as to better assure the safety of the indigenous population. It was also forbidden to take spirits inland to trade with indigenous groups. However these restrictions on the coureurs, for a variety of reasons, never worked. The [[fur trade]] remained dependent on spirits, and increasingly in the hands of the coureurs who journeyed north in search of furs.<ref name=\"Rich, E. E. 1966\"/>\n\nAs time passed, the Coureurs des bois were partially replaced by licensed fur trading endeavors, and the main canoe travel workers of those endeavors were called [[voyageurs]].\n\n===Indigenous peoples===\n[[File:Woodlands Shirt, c. 1720-1750.jpg|thumb|Leather Shirt, c. 1720\u20131750.

Made of antelope hide, the interlocking abstract painted designs probably represent the sacred [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderbird]].]]\nThe [[French people|French]] were interested in exploiting the land through the fur trade as well as the timber trade later on. Despite having tools and guns, the French settlers were dependent on Indigenous people to survive in the difficult climate in this part of North America. Many settlers did not know how to survive through the winter; the Indigenous people showed them how to survive in the New World. They showed the settlers how to hunt for food and to use the furs for clothing that would protect them during the winter months.<ref>{{cite book |last=Friders |first=James S. |title=Native Peoples in Canada: Contemporary Conflicts |location=Scarborough: Ontario |publisher=Prentice-Hall Canada |date=1993 |isbn=978-0-1301-2204-9}}</ref>\n\nAs the fur trade became the dominant economy in the New World, French voyageurs, trappers and hunters often married or formed relationships with Indigenous women. This allowed the French to develop relations with their wives' Indigenous nations, which in turn provided protection and access to their hunting and trapping grounds.\n\nThe fur trade benefited Indigenous people as well. They traded furs for metal tools and other European made items that made their lives easier. Tools such as knives, pots and kettles, nets, firearms and hatchets improved the general welfare of indigenous peoples. At the same time, while everyday life became easier, some traditional ways of doing things were abandoned or altered, and while Indigenous people embraced many of these implements and tools, they also were exposed to less vital trade goods, such as alcohol and sugar, sometimes with deleterious effect.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carlos |first1=Ann M. |last2=Lewis |first2=Frank D. |title=Commerce by Frozen Sea: Native Americans and the European Fur Trade |location=Philadelphia |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0812204827 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wjc34n1z8pYC&pg=PP1}}</ref>\n\n===Formal entry of England in New France area fur trade===\n[[File:Claude Bernou Carte de lAmerique septentrionale.jpg|thumb|1681 French map of the New World above the equator: New France and the [[Great Lakes]] in the north, with a dark line as the [[Mississippi River]] to the west in the [[Illinois Country]] and the mouth of the river (and future New Orleans) then ''[[terra incognita]]'']]\n\nSince [[Henry Hudson]] had claimed [[Hudson Bay]], and the surrounding lands for England in 1611, English colonists had begun expanding their boundaries across what is now the [[Canada|Canadian]] north beyond the French-held territory of New France.

Canada was divided into three districts: the district of Quebec City, the district of [[Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]], and the district of [[Montreal]].{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=247}} Each district had its own separate jurisdiction with a judge appointed by the Crown, known as the civil and criminal lieutenants general.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=247}} They were responsible for all legal matters, civil and criminal, in each of the districts.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=247}}\n\nIn addition to the royal judges, there were other judicial officers in each district.

The Sovereign Council effectively acted as the functional equivalent of a Council of State (''Conseil d'\u00c9tat'') for New France, having the authority to hand down verdicts on final appeal.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=248}} Initially, the Council convened once every week, and the quorum of the Sovereign Council was seven for criminal matters, or five for civil cases.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=248}} The Council's practices evolved over time. At the Sovereign Council there was a king's attorney-general (''procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du roi'') in charge of the similar tasks as the district king's attorneys.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=251}} He was also responsible for supervising the king's attorneys' daily operations as well as execution of royal edicts and regulations passed by the Council in their respective districts.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=252}}\n\n====The Custom of Paris====\n{{Main|The Custom of Paris in New France}}\nIn 1664, the [[The Custom of Paris in New France|Custom of Paris]] (''coutume de Paris'') was formally set as the main source of law for civil law in France's overseas empire. All royal judges and king's attorneys in New France had to be thoroughly familiar with this compilation of rules.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=248}} The Custom governed various civil aspects of the daily life in New France, including property, marriage, inheritance, and so on.\n\n=====Montreal Island: transition from feudal justice to royal justice=====\nThe [[Island of Montreal]] was a special case because its judiciary had been previously held by the Society of St-Sulpice. In 1663, Governor-General of New France [[Augustin de Saffray de M\u00e9sy]] originally considered appointing [[Paul de Chomedey, Sieur de Maisonneuve]] the Governor of the Island of Montreal and consolidating a royal jurisdiction on the island, but the plan garnered the [[Society of Priests of Saint Sulpice|St-Sulpicians]]' disapproval, who held the Island as its own [[fief]]dom and effectively acted as the island's governor.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=253}} In other words, the [[Sovereign Council of New France|Sovereign Council]] had not been able to seize effective control over the legal matters of the Island; instead, the [[Society of Priests of Saint Sulpice|St-Sulpicians]] administered justice on the island.\n\nIt was not until 16 September 1666, that the St-Sulpicians finally handed over the justice of the Island of Montreal to the Intendant of New France.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=254}} In 1693, the French king commanded the replacement of the ecclesiastical courts in Montreal with a royal court composed of one royal judge, with appeals going to the [[Sovereign Council of New France|Sovereign Council]]. The introduction of a royal court on the Montreal Island also resulted in the abolition of the feudal court in the fief of [[Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]] (then held by the [[Jesuits]]).{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=261}}\n\n=====Quebec: founding of the Provostry of Quebec=====\nIn the Quebec City district, the lower court (''tribunal ant\u00e9rieur'') was established in 1664 and had jurisdiction to try cases at first instance, but then it was abolished in 1674.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=264}} The Sovereign Council appointed trial judges (''juges inf\u00e9rieurs'') to adjudicate cases at first instance until the [[Provost (civil)|Provost]]ry of Quebec (''pr\u00e9v\u00f4t\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec'') was created in May 1677.\n\nThe Provostry of Quebec was located in the Hall of Justice (''palais de justice'') in Quebec City and had only one royal judge, also known as the civil and criminal lieutenant general of Quebec City, who heard both civil and criminal cases, as well as district police.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=264}} Additionally, a court clerk and a king's attorney were appointed to the court; if either of these two officers could not attend the trials due to illness or other untenable circumstances, the Intendant would appoint a temporary substitute.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=264}}\n\n===Criminal Justice===\n{{Main|Criminal Justice in New France}}\nIn the early stages of French colonization, the execution of criminal justice in New France were rather arbitrary.

During Father Le Loutre's War, New France established three forts along the border of present-day [[New Brunswick]] to protect it from a New England attack from Nova Scotia. The war continued until British [[Battle of Fort Beaus\u00e9jour|victory at Fort Beausejour]], which dislodged Father Le Loutre from the region, thereby ending his alliance with the Maliseet, [[Acadians]] and [[Mi'kmaq]].<ref name=Grenier/>\n\n===French and Indian War===\n{{Main|French and Indian War|Expulsion of the Acadians}}\n[[File:Nouvelle-France map-en.svg|thumb|Map of territorial claims in [[North America]] by 1750, before the [[French and Indian War]], which was part of the greater worldwide conflict known as the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756 to 1763). Possessions of Britain (pink), France (blue), and Spain (orange, ''California, Pacific Northwest, and Great Basin not indicated'')]]\n\n[[Fort Duquesne]], located at the confluence of the [[Allegheny River|Allegheny]] and [[Monongahela River]]s at the site of present-day [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], guarded the most important strategic location in the west at the time of the Seven Years' War. It was built to ensure that the [[Ohio River]] valley remained under French control. A small colonial force from Virginia began a fort here, but a French force under [[Claude-Pierre P\u00e9caudy de Contrec\u0153ur]] drove them off in April 1754. New France claimed this as part of their colony, and the French were anxious to keep the British from encroaching on it. The French built Fort Duquesne here to serve as a military stronghold and as a base for developing trade and strengthening military alliances with the indigenous peoples of the area.\n\nIn 1755, General [[Edward Braddock]] led [[Braddock Expedition|an expedition]] against Fort Duquesne, and although they were numerically superior to the French militia and their Indian allies, Braddock's army was routed and Braddock was killed.<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/9580/ |title=The Battle of the Monongahela |website=[[World Digital Library]] |date=1755 |accessdate=22 February 2016}}</ref> Later that same year at the Battle of Lake George, the British General William Johnson with a force of 1700 American and Iroquois troops defeated a French force of 2800 French and Canadians and 700 [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] led by Baron Dieskau (Military commander of New France).\n\nThe fight for control over Ohio Country led to the [[French and Indian War]], which began as the North American phase of the [[Seven Years' War]] (which did not technically begin in Europe until 1756). The war began with the defeat of a Virginia militia contingent led by Colonel [[George Washington]] by the French [[troupes de la marine]] in the [[Ohio Country|Ohio valley]]. As a result of that defeat, the British decided to prepare the conquest of Quebec City, the capital of New France. The British defeated France in Acadia in the [[Battle of Fort Beausejour]] (1755) and then [[\u00cele Royale (New France)|\u00cele Royale]] ([[Cape Breton Island]]) (which also administered \u00cele Saint-Jean ([[Prince Edward Island]]) with the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)]].\n\nThroughout the war, the British forcibly removed the Acadians from their lands, which the Mi'kmaq and Acadian militias resisted. The [[Expulsion of the Acadians|Great Upheaval]] continued from 1755 to 1764.\n\nThese British military successes were resisted, with successes by the French and Native Americans. In 1756, a large force of French, Canadians, and their Native American allies led by Marquis de Montcalm launched an attack against the key British post at Fort Oswego on Lake Ontario from Fort Frontenac and forced the garrison to surrender. The following year Montcalm with a huge force of 7200 French and Canadians and 2400 Native Americans laid siege to Fort William Henry on the southern shores of Lake George, and after three weeks of fighting the British commander Monroe surrendered. Montcalm gave him honorable terms to return to England and not to fight for 18 months. But many of the Native Americans were hungry for scalps and loot, so when the British force with civilians were three miles from the fort they massacred about 1100 of the 1500 strong force.\n\nThe following year the French had one victory and one defeat. The defeat was at the French fortress city of Louisbourg. The victory was at the strip of land between Lake Champlain and Lake George at the French fortress of Fort Carillon. The British force sent to capture Fort Carillon (held by just 3400 French regulars and marines with almost no militia or indigenous support) was the largest ever seen in America at that time: 16,200 British, American, and Iroquois troops under the command of General James Abercrombie. This battle cost the British 2200 troops, several artillery pieces against French losses of around 200 killed or wounded.\n\nWhile the British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Conquest of Acadia]] happened in 1710, the French continued to remain a significant force in the region with [[Fort Beausejour]] and [[Fortress Louisbourg]]. The dominant population in the region remained Acadian, that is to say, not British. In 1755, the British were successful in the [[Battle of Beausejour]] and immediately after began the [[expulsion of the Acadians]]. \n\nIn the meantime the French continued to explore westwards and expand their trade alliances with indigenous peoples. [[Fort de la Corne]] was built in 1753, by [[Louis de la Corne, Chevalier de la Corne]] just east of the [[Saskatchewan River Forks]] in what is today the Canadian province of [[Saskatchewan]]. This was the furthest westward outpost of the French Empire in North America to be established before its fall.\n\n==Treaties of cession==\n{{further|Conquest of New France (1758-1760)}}\nIn 1758, British forces again [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|captured Louisbourg]], allowing them to blockade the entrance to the St. Lawrence River. This proved decisive in the war. In 1759, the British besieged Quebec by sea, and an army under General [[James Wolfe]] defeated the French under General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]] at the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] in September. The garrison in Quebec surrendered on 18 September, and by the next year New France had been conquered by the British after [[Montreal Campaign|the attack on Montreal]], which had refused to acknowledge the fall of Canada. The last French governor-general of New France, [[Pierre Fran\u00e7ois de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal]], surrendered to British Major General [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery Amherst]] on 8 September 1760.

The [[Louisiana Territory]], under [[Spain|Spanish]] control since the end of the Seven Years' War, remained off-limits to settlement from the thirteen American colonies.\n\nTwelve years after the British defeated the French, the [[American Revolutionary War]] broke out in the Thirteen Colonies. Many French Canadians would take part in the war, including Major [[Cl\u00e9ment Gosselin]] and Admiral [[Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil]]. After the British surrender at [[Battle of Yorktown (1781)|Yorktown]] in 1781, the [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)|Treaty of Versailles]] gave all former British claims in New France below the [[Great Lakes]] into the possession of the nascent [[United States]]. A Franco-Spanish alliance treaty returned Louisiana to France in 1801, but French leader [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] sold it to the United States in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, ending French colonial efforts in North America.\n\nThe portions of the former New France that remained under British rule were administered as [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]], 1791\u20131841, and then those regions were merged as the [[Province of Canada]] during 1841\u20131867, when the passage of the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act of 1867]] instituted [[home rule]] for most of British North America and established French-speaking Quebec (the former Lower Canada) as one of the original provinces of the [[Confederation of Canada|Dominion of Canada]]. The former French colony of Acadia was first designated the [[Colony of Nova Scotia]] but shortly thereafter the [[Colony of New Brunswick]], which then included Prince Edward Island, was split off from it.\n\nIn Canada, the legacy of New France can be seen in the enduring [[Canadian identity#French Canadians and Identity in English Canada|Francophone identity]] of its descendants, which has led to [[Bilingualism in Canada|institutional bilingualism]] in Canada as a whole.\n\nThe only remnant of the former colonial territory of New France that remains under French control to this day is the French [[overseas collectivity]] of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] (French: Collectivit\u00e9 territoriale de Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon), consisting of a group of small islands {{convert|25|km|mi nmi}} off the coast of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], Canada.\n\n==Political divisions of New France==\n[[File:Constitution-of-new-france-1759.png|thumb|A chart showing the political organization of New France, c. 1759]]\nThe territory of New France was divided into five colonies, each with its own administration: [[Canada (New France)|Canada]], Hudson's Bay, [[Acadia]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] [[Placentia, Newfoundland and Labrador|(Plaisance)]], and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]].<ref name=Francis2009 /><ref name=Territoire /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://slmc.uottawa.ca/?q=canada_new_france |title=Canada at the Time of New France  |date=2004  |author=University of Ottawa |accessdate= March 24, 2017}}</ref> The Treaty of Utrecht resulted in the relinquishing of French claims to mainland Acadia, the Hudson Bay and Newfoundland, and the establishment of the colony of [[Cape Breton Island|\u00cele Royale]], now called Cape Breton Island, where the French built the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]].<ref name=Johnston2001 /><ref name=Louisbourg /> Acadia had a difficult history, with the [[Expulsion of the Acadians|Great Upheaval]], remembered on [[Royal Proclamation of 2003|July 28]] each year since 2003.

Some Anglophone historians portray the Conquest as a victory for \"British military, political and economic superiority\" and argue that it ultimately brought benefits to the French settlers.<ref name=Jaenen/> However, Cornelius Jaenen notes that French-Canadian historians remain strongly divided on the subject. One group sees it as a highly negative economic, political and ideological disaster that threatened a way of life with materialism and Protestantism.

He appeared previously for [[Feyenoord Ghana|Feyenoord Academy]] and [[Esp\u00e9rance Sportive de Tunis|ES Tunis]] and spent time on loan to [[Asante Kotoko S.C.|Asante Kotoko]].\n\nHarrison came through the youth setup at the [[West African Football Academy|Feyenoord Academy]], spending his first two professional seasons on the Academy's senior team. He then moved on loan to Asante Kotoko, spending two seasons with the Porcupines and winning the [[Ghana Premier League]] in 2008. After four years of professional football, Harrison left Ghana for the first time to join ES Tunis of the [[Tunisian Ligue Professionnelle 1]]. He played the next six seasons with Tunis, appearing for the club more than 170 times. Tunis won four league titles during Harrison's time there, appeared in three [[CAF Champions League]] finals, and won the [[2011 CAF Champions League Final]]; Harrison scored the only goal over the two legs. In the summer of 2015, Harrison moved to the United States and signed for Columbus Crew SC, helping the club reach [[MLS Cup 2015]] in his first season.\n\nAt the international level, Harrison made his Ghanaian debut at the [[2008 Africa Cup of Nations]], helping Ghana to a third-place finish at that tournament. He has since appeared for the [[Ghana national football team|Black Stars]] at four more AFCON tournaments, finishing as runners-up in [[2010 Africa Cup of Nations|2010]] and [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations|2015]]. He was called up to Ghana's squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], appearing twice during the tournament. Harrison captained his nation for the first time in a [[Exhibition game#International football|friendly]] against [[Congo national football team|Congo]] on 1 September 2015.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Tema]], Harrison grew up {{convert|23|km|abbr=off}} away in [[Nungua]], Ghana. He used to watch the Ghana national team on television with his family before becoming a professional footballer.<ref name=Story>{{cite web |url=https://footballghana.com/even-if-i-get-one-minute-to-play-i-will-make-use-of-it-harrison-affuls-world-cup-story |title=\"Even if I get one minute to play, I will make use of it.\"- Harrison Afful's World Cup story |website=FootballGhana.com |publisher=Football Ghana |accessdate=20 December 2018 |date=14 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Club career==\n===Feyenoord Academy===\nHarrison joined the [[Feyenoord Ghana|Feyenoord Academy]] after being discovered as a youth by [[Sam Arday]] and went on to spend four years with the senior team.<ref>{{cite web |last=Abayateye |first=Michael |url=https://www.primenewsghana.com/sports/harrison-afful-s-tribute-to-sam-ardey.html |title=Harrison Afful\u2019s tribute to Sam Arday |website=PrimeNewsGhana.com |publisher=Prime Network Ltd. |accessdate=20 December 2018 |date=13 February 2017}}</ref> Although he spent two of those seasons on loan to [[Asante Kotoko S.C.]], Harrison appeared 148 times in total and scored 11 goals for the Academy.

Copenhagen|K\u00f8benhavn]] but was told that he was too small and returned to Ghana.<ref name=Story/> He also spent time training with [[Helsingborgs IF|Helsingborgs]] in December of that year but failed to land a deal after suffering a [[hamstring injury]] while he was in Sweden.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ghanasoccernet.com/content/view/2222/51/ |title=Afful fails to land Sweden deal |website=GhanaSoccernet.com |publisher=Ghana Soccernet |date=11 December 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818234752/http://www.ghanasoccernet.com/content/view/2222/51/ |archivedate=18 August 2009 |access-date=27 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\n====Loan to Asante Kotoko====\nHarrison joined Asante Kotoko on loan at the start of the 2007 season, the first time he had played at a club other than the Feyenoord Academy. The loan move was made possible through a clause in [[Jordan Opoku]]'s contract. He had been bought by Asante Kotoko the year before, and his contract allowed Kotoko to choose one player to bring in on loan from the Academy. They exercised it by choosing Harrison.<ref name=Osmaninterview>{{cite web |last=Osman |first=Rahman |url=http://sport.citifmonline.com/2015/07/07/harrison-afful-small-man-huge-drive-and-passion/ |title=Harrison Afful: Small man, huge drive and passion |website=CitiFMOnline.com |publisher=Citi Newsroom |accessdate=20 December 2018 |date=7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nKotoko head coach Bashiru Hayford handed Harrison his debut with a 10-minute cameo in a friendly match.

He appeared previously for [[Feyenoord Ghana|Feyenoord Academy]] and [[Esp\u00e9rance Sportive de Tunis|ES Tunis]] and spent time on loan to [[Asante Kotoko S.C.|Asante Kotoko]].\n\nHarrison came through the youth setup at the [[West African Football Academy|Feyenoord Academy]], spending his first two professional seasons on the Academy's senior team. He then moved on loan to Asante Kotoko, spending two seasons with the Porcupines and winning the [[Ghana Premier League]] in 2008. After four years of professional football, Harrison left Ghana for the first time to join ES Tunis of the [[Tunisian Ligue Professionnelle 1]]. He played the next six seasons with Tunis, appearing for the club more than 170 times. Tunis won four league titles during Harrison's time there, appeared in three [[CAF Champions League]] finals, and won the [[2011 CAF Champions League Final]]; Harrison scored the only goal over the two legs. In the summer of 2015, Harrison moved to the United States and signed for Columbus Crew SC, helping the club reach [[MLS Cup 2015]] in his first season.\n\nAt the international level, Harrison made his Ghanaian debut at the [[2008 Africa Cup of Nations]], helping Ghana to a third-place finish at that tournament. He has since appeared for the [[Ghana national football team|Black Stars]] at four more AFCON tournaments, finishing as runners-up in [[2010 Africa Cup of Nations|2010]] and [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations|2015]]. He was called up to Ghana's squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], appearing twice during the tournament.

Some are told in the traditional manner; with a beginning, middle and end; others are short staccato bursts of poetic energy, gorgeous in their use of language and satisfying as a good story should be... None is disappointing. Each story is a good read, and the variety of construction adds to the interest and encourages further exploration ... For your average Kiwi, it adds an exotic touch and extra interest ... Some stories make you wonder where they come from, how they arrived in the author\u2019s imagination, but they \u2018re so good you\u2019d be pleased they did. Paul Brooks - Midweek\n\n\u201cMoisa doesn\u2019t disappoint. His stories are wide-ranging, both in subject matter and character portrayal, and his wit and his perception of human frailty reflect a life lived in several manifestations. This collection covers stories from New Zealand scenes as well as echoing the six years spent as a child in Cyprus in the late 1950s and as a young man in 1973 and 1974. ... Several of Moisa\u2019s stories have the surprise ending which is imperative for a good story, and this is one of the strengths and delights of his book ... Blood and Koka Kola ... is a very interesting, insightful and appealing collection of short stories...\u201d Michael O'Leary- Landfall\n\n==Novel==\n* The Hour of the Grey Wolf, Christodoulos Moisa 2016, {{ISBN|978-1519445988}} \nCRITICS COMMENTS: \"The writing style can best be described as erudite with allusions to historical and Biblical events. In a less fluent writer, these descriptions would slow the story down but this is not the case ... The book remains fast-moving while giving the reader the satisfaction of having read a novel of substance and at the same time enjoying trying to second guess the mystery murder element. I recommend it.\" <ref>Doug Davidson RIVER CITY PRESS 14 July 2016.</ref>\nThe Hour of the Grey Wolf is a crime story ... in many ways, it defies the genre. It is literary fiction as well, experimental in form, so experimental that, simply linked together with logic, the parts should not work together to form that coherent whole. And yet they do. ... a compelling page-turner, a classic whodunit. ... I kept turning the pages and am certain other readers will too. The overall effect of The Hour of the Grey Wolf cannot be denied: the setting and characters are still resonating with me ...\" <ref>Antony Millen \u2013 Crime Watch - Investigating crime fiction from a Kiwi perspective April 2016</ref>\n\n* Overcast Sunday, Christodoulos Moisa 2016,{{ISBN|9781523354214}}\nCRITICS COMMENTS: \"While the main story is sufficient to hold your interest, it is embellished with a cultural richness that sets it apart from just another \u201cWho-dunnit\u201c ... The cleverly devised plot will keep you intrigued right through to the end ... For those of us familiar with Wellington during the 1950s\u2019 \u201cOvercast Sunday\u201d will evoke a few memories of a time and lifestyle that no longer exists. The title itself belongs to a song, a type of blues music in keeping with the sentiments of love, joy and sorrow and particularly poignant for immigrants far from their homeland. The book gives examples of the hardships, hopes and dashed dreams which marked their lives and the reasons for moving to New Zealand. Like all immigrants they found it to be no promised land and this informs and colours the book as various incidents are woven into the plot ...\" Marion Davidson RIVER CITY PRESS 17 November 2016.\n\n\"This is not your average crime novel, in fact, although the story features a crime- a murder \u2013 it is a story of a place, a time, and the characters who converge on both. It is about people and the stories they bring to the Greek community in Wellington 1950. The story opens with ... Chris Moisa has written a fine story, crafted in such a way that may irritate and impatient reader, but rich in knowledge and understanding of the community in which the book is centered, and the forces that bring everything together at that point.\nThe reader learns a lot and becomes intimately engaged with each character, their lives laid bare for us in the book\u2019s unusual configuration. \nThe author captured the time, the economics, politics and social ambiance of New Zealand in 1950, with the Greek community the focus of his attention.\nThe story is not for me to tell but I really enjoyed it. The book is not laid out in a traditional format, and what I see it has challenged the odd critic. I found it enhanced the yarn Chris tells.  This latest book is a valuable addition to the repertoire of a superb writer.\n<ref name=\"Paul Brooks\">{{cite news|last1=Moisa|first1=Christodooulos|title=Crime Story brings 1950s NZ to life.|agency=Midweek|publisher=NZ Herald|date=17 May 2017}}</ref> Paul Brooks\nMidweek - Herald - 17 May 2017\n\n*Wolves in Dogs Clothing, Christodoulos Moisa 2017,{{ISBN|978-1548977368}}\nCRITICS COMMENTS: \"The novel is set in Cyprus during the coup and the Turkish invasion in 1974 and the major plot based on a series of brutal murders is supported by a number of equally intriguing subplots .... the writing style is a combination thriller and interesting snippets about history, politics, society and mythology. It is a style that I appreciate. I learn while I am kept enthralled by the action. ... the Turkish invasion, which Chris although from a Greek background, writes about with admirable balance, and gives another depth to the novel. Chris ... writes with an assuredness of someone who is in control of his craft ...\" Doug Davidson - River City (23 November 2017)\n\n\"... has done his research and knows the time and place of which he writes, but his own writing skills give honesty to the characters and how they live their lives. The conversations are real, without being too mundane, and how they look, dress and act completes a populated word landscape too real to be complete fiction.\" Paul Brooks - Midweek / New Zealand Herald (10 January 2018)\n\nCurrently Moisa lives in [[Whanganui]] and works as a novelist, artist, photographer.

{"title_page": "Zero-based budgeting", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{advert|date=January 2017}}\n{{confusing|date=January 2017}}\n{{unfocused|date=January 2017}}\n}}\n{{Cleanup|reason=Article contains sentence fragments, poor punctuation, and bad paragraph structure|date=June 2015}} \n\n'''Zero-based budgeting''' (ZBB) is a terrible method of budgeting in which all expenses must be justified and approved for each new period. Developed by [[Peter Pyhrr]] in the 1970s, zero-based budgeting starts from a \"zero base\" at the beginning of every budget period, analyzing needs and costs of every function within an organization and allocating funds accordingly, regardless of how much money has previously been budgeted to any given line item.\n\n==History==\nAs an [[accounting manager]] for [[Texas Instruments]], Peter Pyrrh created zero-based budgeting to facilitate the incorporation of top-level strategic objectives into the budgeting process by tying them to specific functional areas within the organization. \nUnder his system, costs are grouped and measured against previous results and current expectations, enabling management to allocate funds by current need instead of by historical expenditures.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAuthor of ''Zero Based Budgeting: A Practical Management Tool for Evaluating Expenses'', Pyhrr was appointed by then-[[Georgia (US state)|Georgia]] governor [[Jimmy Carter]] to manage the state's budgetary process.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/meet-the-father-of-zero-based-budgeting-1427415074|title=Meet the Father of Zero-Based Budgeting|first=David|last=Kesmodel|date=27 March 2015|publisher=|via=Wall Street Journal}}</ref>\n\n==Advantages==\n#Accuracy: This type of budgeting helps companies to look over every department to make sure they are getting the correct amount of money. \n#Efficiency: It helps judge the actual needs by focusing on current numbers instead of past budgets. \n#Reduction in wasteful spending: It can remove redundant spending by re-examining potentially unnecessary expenditures.  \n#Coordination and Communication: It allows for better communication within departments by involving employees in decision-making and budget prioritization. \n\n==Disadvantages==\n\n#Bureaucracy: Creating ZBB within a company can take enormous amounts of time, effort, and analysis that would require extra staff. This could cause the process to be counterproductive in cutting costs. \n#Corruption: In using ZBB, managers could attempt to skew numbers to make expenditures into vital activities, thus creating a \"need\" for them. This would cause companies to continue wasting money on things they don't need. \n#Intangible Justifications: This type of budgeting requires departments to justify their budget, which can be difficult on many levels. Departments such as advertising and marketing have to justify expenses they may or may not use in the next year due to the fluctuation of the market. This could cost them profits in the future due to not being able to justify a certain amount. \n#Managerial Time: ZBB comes at the cost of time and extra training for managers. This means extra time every year to do the budget, make adjustments and receive the proper training to understand how to do ZBB. \n#Slower Response Time: Due to the amount of time and training is required to do ZBB, managerial staff could be less likely to revise the budget in response to a changing market. This means that it will take longer for a company to move money into departments that need it the most at the time. ZBB could potentially leave gaps in a company because the budget might not react to departments' sudden needs. \n<ref>http://www.accountingtools.com/zero-based-budgeting</ref>\n\n==Use in Public and Private Sectors==\n\n===Background===\n\nZero-based budgeting in the public sector versus the private sector is a different process. \"The use of ZBB in the private sector has been limited primarily to administrative overhead activities (i.e. administrative expenses needed to maintain the organization).{{rp|51}} In the United States Zero-based budgeting was developed in 1969 at Texas Instrument Inc. [[Jimmy Carter]], then Governor of Georgia, was the first to adopt the process of zero-base into the government for the preparation of the fiscal of 1973 budget. Three years later, sponsored by the President and Congress the federal government for the first time implemented zero-base budgeting in The Government Economy and Spending Reform act of 1976.<ref name=\"Pyhrra\">Pyhrr, Peter A. \"The Zero-Base Approach To Government Budgeting.\" PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW, Jan. 1977.</ref>\n\nPresident Carter later required the adoption of ZBB by the federal government during the late 1970s. \"Zero-Base Budgeting (ZBB) was an executive branch budget formulation process introduced into the federal government in 1977. Its main focus was on optimizing accomplishments available at alternative budgetary levels. Under ZBB agencies were expected to set priorities based on the program results that could be achieved at alternative spending levels, one of which was to be below current funding.\"<ref name=\"auto\">GAO, Performance Budgeting: Past Initiatives Offer Insights for GPRA Implementation (March 1997).</ref>\n\nFor most of the United States government, the main users of ZBB are the legislative, executive, and the agency. The legislative includes the congress, state legislature, and city council, and they require more summarization and focusing on public priorities and objectives. Agencies include the agency director and department managers and they require more detailed information and focus on program implementation and efficiency. Lastly, the executive includes the President, governors, mayor/city manager and they focus on the needs of the legislature and agency.<ref name=\" Pyhrra\"/> Although the legislative, the agency, and the executive have different focuses they all have to address two standard questions:\n# Are the current activities efficient and effective?\n# Should current activities be eliminated or reduced to fund higher-priority new programs? Or to reduce the current budget?<ref name=\"Pyhrra\"/>\nAccording to Peter Sarant, the former director of management analysis training for the US Civil Service Commission during the Carter ZBB implementation effort,  \"ZBB means 'different things to different people'.\" Some definitions imply that zero-based budgeting is the act of starting budgets from scratch or requiring each program or activity to be justified from the ground up. This is not true; the acronym ZBB is a misnomer. ZBB is a misnomer because in many large agencies a complete zero-base review of all program elements during one budget period is not feasible; it would result in excessive paperwork and be an almost impossible task if implemented.\"<ref name=\"Sarant\">Peter Sarant, Zero-base Budgeting in the Public Sector, A Pragmatic Approach (Addison-Wesley 1978).</ref>{{rp|3}}\nIn many respects, the \"common misunderstanding\" of ZBB noted above resembles a \"sunset review\" process more than a traditional public sector ZBB process.\n\n===Components of a public sector ZBB analysis===\nIn an overview of zero-based budgeting, there are a total of three elements that make up the concept:\n# Decision Unit Determination  \n##This is the building process of the formulation of a budget structure. \n# Decision Package Formulation\n## When compiling and packaging a budget request, this mechanism is utilized.\n# Ranking  \n## This process requires the most attention as it requires a company's manager(s) to prioritize out of a group of decision packages that are laid out to them. \nIn general three components make up public sector ZBB:\n\n# Identify three alternate funding levels for each decision unit (Traditionally, this has been a zero-base level, a current funding level, and an enhanced service level.);\n# Determine the impact of these funding levels on program (decision unit) operations using program performance metrics; and\n# Rank the program \"decision packages\" for the three funding levels.\n\nIn many cases, program staffers were asked to look for alternative service delivery models that could deliver services more efficiently at lower funding levels.\n\nThe [[US General Accounting Office]] (GAO) reviewed past performance budgeting initiatives in 1997 and found that ZBBs \"main focus was on optimizing accomplishments available at alternative budgetary levels:\n\nSet priorities based on the program results that could be achieved at alternative spending levels, one of which was to be below current funding.\n\n# In developing budget forms, these were to be ranked against each other sequentially from the lowest level organizations up through the department and without reference to a past base. \n# In concept, ZBB sought a precise link between budgetary resources and program results.\"<ref name=\"auto\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\nFurther, \"ZBB illustrated the usefulness of:\n\n# Defining and presenting alternative funding levels; and \n# Expanded participation of program managers in the budget process.\"\n\nThe federal ZBB budgeting system had the following components: \"Budget requests for each decision unit were to be prepared by their managers, who would (1) identify alternative approaches to achieving the unit's objectives, (2) identify several alternative funding levels, including a \"minimum\" level normally below current funding, (3) prepare \"decision packages\" according to a prescribed format for each unit, including budget and performance information, and (4) rank the decision packages against each other.\"<ref name=\"auto\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\nZBB was officially eliminated in federal budgeting on August 7, 1981. \"Some participants in the budget process, as well as other observers, attributed certain program efficiencies, arising from the consideration of alternatives, to ZBB. ZBB established within federal budgeting a requirement to:\n\n# Present alternative levels of funding; and \n# Link (them) to alternative results.\"<ref name=\"auto\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\nThis element of the ZBB budgeting process remained in effect through the Reagan, Bush and early Clinton administrations before being eliminated in 1994.\n\n\u2192Defining the government program zero-base:\n\nAs noted earlier, there is often considerable confusion over the meaning of zero-base budgeting. There is no evidence that public sector ZBB has ever included \"building budgets from the bottom up\" and \"reviewing every invoice\" as part of the analysis. In discussions of ZBB, there is often confusion between a ZBB process and a sunset review process. In a sunset review, the entire function is eliminated unless evidence is provided of program effectiveness. This confusion ultimately leads to the question: what is a zero-base?\n\nSarant's definition of the zero-base based on the federal training experience is: \"A minimum level is the grassroots funding level necessary to keep a program alive. Therefore, the minimal level is the \"program or funding level below which it is not feasible to continue a program... because no constructive contribution can be made toward fulfilling its objective.\"<ref name=Sarant/>{{rp|73}} Identifying this level of program funding has been subjective and problematic.\n\nConsequently, \"some states have selected arbitrary percentages to ensure that an amount smaller than last year's request is considered. They do this by stipulating that one alternative must be 50, 80, or 90 percent of last year's request.\"<ref name=\"Lynch\">Thomas D. Lynch, Public Budgeting in America (Prentice-Hall, 3rd Edition, 1990).</ref>{{rp|52}} This equates to analyzing the impact on program operations of a 10, 20 or 50 percent reduction in funding as the \"zero bases\" funding level.\n\n===Importance of performance measures===\n\nPerformance measures are a key component of the ZBB process. At the core, ZBB requires quality measures that can be used to analyze the impact of alternative funding scenarios on program operations and outcomes. Without quality measures ZBB simply will not work because decision packages cannot be ranked. To perform a ZBB analysis \"alternative decision packages are prepared and ranked, thus allowing marginal utility and comparative analysis.\"<ref name=Lynch/>{{rp|52}}\n\nTraditionally, a ZBB analysis focused on three types of measures. \"They (federal agency program staff) were to identify the key indicators to be used in measuring performance and results. These should be \"measures of:\n\n# effectiveness,\n# efficiency, and \n# workload for each decision unit.\n\nIndirect or proxy indicators could be used if these systems did not exist or were under development.\"<ref name=\"auto\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\n===Impact on government operations===\n\nAccording to the GAO:\n\n\"Agencies believed that inadequate time had been allowed to implement the new initiative. The requirement to compress planning and budgeting functions within the time frames of the budget cycle had proven especially difficult, affecting program managers' ability to identify alternative approaches to accomplishing agency objectives. Some agency officials also believed that the performance information needed for ZBB analysis was lacking.\"<ref name=\"auto\"/>{{rp|50\u201351}}\n\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures:<ref>National Conference of State Legislatures, Fundamentals of Sound Budgeting Practices, June 1995 http://www.ncsl.org/IssuesResearch/BudgetTax/FundamentalsofSoundStateBudgetingPractices/tabid/12653/Default.aspx</ref>\n\n\"In its original sense, ZBB meant that no past decisions are taken for granted. Every previous budget decision is up for review. Existing and proposed programs are on an equal footing, and the traditional state practice of altering almost all existing budget lines by small amounts every year or two would be swept away. No state government has ever found this feasible. Even Georgia, where Governor Jimmy Carter introduced ZBB to state budgeting in 1971, employed a much-modified form.\n\nState programs are not, in practice, amenable to such a radical annual re-examination. Statutes, obligations to local governments, requirements of the federal government, and other past decisions have many times created state funding commitments that are almost impossible to change very much in the short run. Education funding levels are determined in many states partly by state and federal judicial decisions and state constitutional provisions, as well as by statutes. Federal mandates require that state Medicaid funding meet a specific minimum level if Medicaid is to exist at all in a state. Federal law affects environmental program spending, and both state and federal courts help determine state spending on prisons. Much state spending, therefore, cannot usefully be subjected to the kind of fundamental re-examination that ZBB in its original form envisions.\n\nTo the extent that ZBB has encouraged governors and legislators to take a hard look at the impact of incremental changes in state spending, it produced a significant improvement in state budgeting. But in its classic form \u2013 begin all budget evaluations from zero \u2013 ZBB is as unworkable as it ever was.\"\n\n=== Use in the Chinese Public Sector ===\nThe concept of ZBB was first introduced to China at the beginning of the 1990s and was primarily focused in the Hubei Province area of China. Just as the United States encountered many problems and failures with ZBB, China too ran into them as well. But even with the numerous problems and failures along the way, they have gradually adjusted appropriately since then to become more effective in using ZBB as a budget reform. Western influence on budgeting was non-existent in China before 1993. It was during the 1990s that China began looking out for a new and modern form of budgeting for their country\u2019s nationwide budget reform.  They ended up settling on ZBB.  A new policy was set in place to put ZBB into action, known as the DBR, or the Departmental Budgeting Reform. The DBR and ZBB were first implemented in the Hubei province of China. According to Jun Ma, a professor at the University of Nebraska, the beginning years of ZBB in Hubei were a bit rocky as the DBR had not yet been implemented into all the state departments in Hubei. Only a few departments implemented the budgeting system and the results of multiple departments using multiple budgeting systems were not good. It slowly became clear that using ZBB in a traditional sense would not work out. Officials in the Hubei province and the DBR began looking for ways to incorporate the best parts of ZBB and form a new budgeting system that would work for their needs. The result of this change was a Chinese-styled Target-Based Budgeting system. This form of budgeting required bureaucracies and agencies to submit a simple budget within a pre-set time limit. TBB, as a modified form of ZBB, has worked out moderately okay for the Chinese government in Hubei over the years, but many problems still face the budgeting system.\n\nSome number of issues ranging from the absence of a unified budget and certain expenditures that are somehow exempt from the ZBB process, to the influence or effects of political factors have been widely noted.\n# Absence of a Budget Unification- Though the Hubei Province has developed a thorough budget by combining expenditures and off-budget revenues into the budget, there yet remains certain types of expenses that are still under the control of certain individuals other than the government Finance Department. Because of this, the difficulty of prioritizing all the possible government programs becomes confusing.\n# Political Factor Influences- No matter what the term or whose term it is, political officials have always had a certain plan or change that they would like to implement that would greatly influence the prioritizing process of ZBB. Certain political officials could say they greatly support a certain program and would like the Finance Department to focus more money on that particular program whilst other political officials would think otherwise. Therefore, any real changes or improvements made will always face opposition unless you have unified political support. \n# Expenditure exemptions- Ranging from operating and personnel expenses to central government policies that are unfunded that start after the budget year, these are just to name a few things that are excluded from the ZBB process. By not including a large portion of spending into the ZBB process, the effectiveness potential of these reforms becomes greatly reduced. \nTwo notable reforms to the ZBB process include having departments submit budget requests and the use of sunset legislation.\n# Budget requests- These requests are to reflect (1) a cut of a certain percentage, (2) current level of spending, and (3) an increase of a certain percentage. This allows the opportunity of trading between departments of the funding of a lower priority of one department to a higher priority of another. \n# Sunset legislation- This process places a sense of urgency on certain programs implemented or that are currently being funded as that program shall be placed under review to determine efficiency & effectiveness, and see whether the public or government need this program.

Developed by [[Peter Pyhrr]] in the 1970s, zero-based budgeting starts from a \"zero base\" at the beginning of every budget period, analyzing needs and costs of every function within an organization and allocating funds accordingly, regardless of how much money has previously been budgeted to any given line item.\n\n==History==\nAs an [[accounting manager]] for [[Texas Instruments]], Peter Pyrrh created zero-based budgeting to facilitate the incorporation of top-level strategic objectives into the budgeting process by tying them to specific functional areas within the organization. \nUnder his system, costs are grouped and measured against previous results and current expectations, enabling management to allocate funds by current need instead of by historical expenditures.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAuthor of ''Zero Based Budgeting: A Practical Management Tool for Evaluating Expenses'', Pyhrr was appointed by then-[[Georgia (US state)|Georgia]] governor [[Jimmy Carter]] to manage the state's budgetary process.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/meet-the-father-of-zero-based-budgeting-1427415074|title=Meet the Father of Zero-Based Budgeting|first=David|last=Kesmodel|date=27 March 2015|publisher=|via=Wall Street Journal}}</ref>\n\n==Advantages==\n#Accuracy: This type of budgeting helps companies to look over every department to make sure they are getting the correct amount of money. \n#Efficiency: It helps judge the actual needs by focusing on current numbers instead of past budgets. \n#Reduction in wasteful spending: It can remove redundant spending by re-examining potentially unnecessary expenditures.  \n#Coordination and Communication: It allows for better communication within departments by involving employees in decision-making and budget prioritization. \n\n==Disadvantages==\n\n#Bureaucracy: Creating ZBB within a company can take enormous amounts of time, effort, and analysis that would require extra staff. This could cause the process to be counterproductive in cutting costs. \n#Corruption: In using ZBB, managers could attempt to skew numbers to make expenditures into vital activities, thus creating a \"need\" for them. This would cause companies to continue wasting money on things they don't need. \n#Intangible Justifications: This type of budgeting requires departments to justify their budget, which can be difficult on many levels. Departments such as advertising and marketing have to justify expenses they may or may not use in the next year due to the fluctuation of the market. This could cost them profits in the future due to not being able to justify a certain amount. \n#Managerial Time: ZBB comes at the cost of time and extra training for managers. This means extra time every year to do the budget, make adjustments and receive the proper training to understand how to do ZBB. \n#Slower Response Time: Due to the amount of time and training is required to do ZBB, managerial staff could be less likely to revise the budget in response to a changing market. This means that it will take longer for a company to move money into departments that need it the most at the time. ZBB could potentially leave gaps in a company because the budget might not react to departments' sudden needs. \n<ref>http://www.accountingtools.com/zero-based-budgeting</ref>\n\n==Use in Public and Private Sectors==\n\n===Background===\n\nZero-based budgeting in the public sector versus the private sector is a different process. \"The use of ZBB in the private sector has been limited primarily to administrative overhead activities (i.e. administrative expenses needed to maintain the organization).{{rp|51}} In the United States Zero-based budgeting was developed in 1969 at Texas Instrument Inc. [[Jimmy Carter]], then Governor of Georgia, was the first to adopt the process of zero-base into the government for the preparation of the fiscal of 1973 budget. Three years later, sponsored by the President and Congress the federal government for the first time implemented zero-base budgeting in The Government Economy and Spending Reform act of 1976.<ref name=\"Pyhrra\">Pyhrr, Peter A. \"The Zero-Base Approach To Government Budgeting.\" PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW, Jan. 1977.</ref>\n\nPresident Carter later required the adoption of ZBB by the federal government during the late 1970s. \"Zero-Base Budgeting (ZBB) was an executive branch budget formulation process introduced into the federal government in 1977. Its main focus was on optimizing accomplishments available at alternative budgetary levels. Under ZBB agencies were expected to set priorities based on the program results that could be achieved at alternative spending levels, one of which was to be below current funding.\"<ref name=\"auto\">GAO, Performance Budgeting: Past Initiatives Offer Insights for GPRA Implementation (March 1997).</ref>\n\nFor most of the United States government, the main users of ZBB are the legislative, executive, and the agency. The legislative includes the congress, state legislature, and city council, and they require more summarization and focusing on public priorities and objectives. Agencies include the agency director and department managers and they require more detailed information and focus on program implementation and efficiency. Lastly, the executive includes the President, governors, mayor/city manager and they focus on the needs of the legislature and agency.<ref name=\" Pyhrra\"/> Although the legislative, the agency, and the executive have different focuses they all have to address two standard questions:\n# Are the current activities efficient and effective?\n# Should current activities be eliminated or reduced to fund higher-priority new programs? Or to reduce the current budget?<ref name=\"Pyhrra\"/>\nAccording to Peter Sarant, the former director of management analysis training for the US Civil Service Commission during the Carter ZBB implementation effort,  \"ZBB means 'different things to different people'.\" Some definitions imply that zero-based budgeting is the act of starting budgets from scratch or requiring each program or activity to be justified from the ground up. This is not true; the acronym ZBB is a misnomer. ZBB is a misnomer because in many large agencies a complete zero-base review of all program elements during one budget period is not feasible; it would result in excessive paperwork and be an almost impossible task if implemented.\"<ref name=\"Sarant\">Peter Sarant, Zero-base Budgeting in the Public Sector, A Pragmatic Approach (Addison-Wesley 1978).</ref>{{rp|3}}\nIn many respects, the \"common misunderstanding\" of ZBB noted above resembles a \"sunset review\" process more than a traditional public sector ZBB process.\n\n===Components of a public sector ZBB analysis===\nIn an overview of zero-based budgeting, there are a total of three elements that make up the concept:\n# Decision Unit Determination  \n##This is the building process of the formulation of a budget structure. \n# Decision Package Formulation\n## When compiling and packaging a budget request, this mechanism is utilized.\n# Ranking  \n## This process requires the most attention as it requires a company's manager(s) to prioritize out of a group of decision packages that are laid out to them. \nIn general three components make up public sector ZBB:\n\n# Identify three alternate funding levels for each decision unit (Traditionally, this has been a zero-base level, a current funding level, and an enhanced service level.);\n# Determine the impact of these funding levels on program (decision unit) operations using program performance metrics; and\n# Rank the program \"decision packages\" for the three funding levels.\n\nIn many cases, program staffers were asked to look for alternative service delivery models that could deliver services more efficiently at lower funding levels.\n\nThe [[US General Accounting Office]] (GAO) reviewed past performance budgeting initiatives in 1997 and found that ZBBs \"main focus was on optimizing accomplishments available at alternative budgetary levels:\n\nSet priorities based on the program results that could be achieved at alternative spending levels, one of which was to be below current funding.\n\n# In developing budget forms, these were to be ranked against each other sequentially from the lowest level organizations up through the department and without reference to a past base. \n# In concept, ZBB sought a precise link between budgetary resources and program results.\"<ref name=\"auto\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\nFurther, \"ZBB illustrated the usefulness of:\n\n# Defining and presenting alternative funding levels; and \n# Expanded participation of program managers in the budget process.\"\n\nThe federal ZBB budgeting system had the following components: \"Budget requests for each decision unit were to be prepared by their managers, who would (1) identify alternative approaches to achieving the unit's objectives, (2) identify several alternative funding levels, including a \"minimum\" level normally below current funding, (3) prepare \"decision packages\" according to a prescribed format for each unit, including budget and performance information, and (4) rank the decision packages against each other.\"<ref name=\"auto\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\nZBB was officially eliminated in federal budgeting on August 7, 1981. \"Some participants in the budget process, as well as other observers, attributed certain program efficiencies, arising from the consideration of alternatives, to ZBB. ZBB established within federal budgeting a requirement to:\n\n# Present alternative levels of funding; and \n# Link (them) to alternative results.\"<ref name=\"auto\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\nThis element of the ZBB budgeting process remained in effect through the Reagan, Bush and early Clinton administrations before being eliminated in 1994.\n\n\u2192Defining the government program zero-base:\n\nAs noted earlier, there is often considerable confusion over the meaning of zero-base budgeting. There is no evidence that public sector ZBB has ever included \"building budgets from the bottom up\" and \"reviewing every invoice\" as part of the analysis. In discussions of ZBB, there is often confusion between a ZBB process and a sunset review process. In a sunset review, the entire function is eliminated unless evidence is provided of program effectiveness. This confusion ultimately leads to the question: what is a zero-base?\n\nSarant's definition of the zero-base based on the federal training experience is: \"A minimum level is the grassroots funding level necessary to keep a program alive. Therefore, the minimal level is the \"program or funding level below which it is not feasible to continue a program... because no constructive contribution can be made toward fulfilling its objective.\"<ref name=Sarant/>{{rp|73}} Identifying this level of program funding has been subjective and problematic.\n\nConsequently, \"some states have selected arbitrary percentages to ensure that an amount smaller than last year's request is considered. They do this by stipulating that one alternative must be 50, 80, or 90 percent of last year's request.\"<ref name=\"Lynch\">Thomas D. Lynch, Public Budgeting in America (Prentice-Hall, 3rd Edition, 1990).</ref>{{rp|52}} This equates to analyzing the impact on program operations of a 10, 20 or 50 percent reduction in funding as the \"zero bases\" funding level.\n\n===Importance of performance measures===\n\nPerformance measures are a key component of the ZBB process. At the core, ZBB requires quality measures that can be used to analyze the impact of alternative funding scenarios on program operations and outcomes. Without quality measures ZBB simply will not work because decision packages cannot be ranked. To perform a ZBB analysis \"alternative decision packages are prepared and ranked, thus allowing marginal utility and comparative analysis.\"<ref name=Lynch/>{{rp|52}}\n\nTraditionally, a ZBB analysis focused on three types of measures. \"They (federal agency program staff) were to identify the key indicators to be used in measuring performance and results. These should be \"measures of:\n\n# effectiveness,\n# efficiency, and \n# workload for each decision unit.\n\nIndirect or proxy indicators could be used if these systems did not exist or were under development.\"<ref name=\"auto\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\n===Impact on government operations===\n\nAccording to the GAO:\n\n\"Agencies believed that inadequate time had been allowed to implement the new initiative. The requirement to compress planning and budgeting functions within the time frames of the budget cycle had proven especially difficult, affecting program managers' ability to identify alternative approaches to accomplishing agency objectives. Some agency officials also believed that the performance information needed for ZBB analysis was lacking.\"<ref name=\"auto\"/>{{rp|50\u201351}}\n\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures:<ref>National Conference of State Legislatures, Fundamentals of Sound Budgeting Practices, June 1995 http://www.ncsl.org/IssuesResearch/BudgetTax/FundamentalsofSoundStateBudgetingPractices/tabid/12653/Default.aspx</ref>\n\n\"In its original sense, ZBB meant that no past decisions are taken for granted. Every previous budget decision is up for review. Existing and proposed programs are on an equal footing, and the traditional state practice of altering almost all existing budget lines by small amounts every year or two would be swept away. No state government has ever found this feasible. Even Georgia, where Governor Jimmy Carter introduced ZBB to state budgeting in 1971, employed a much-modified form.\n\nState programs are not, in practice, amenable to such a radical annual re-examination. Statutes, obligations to local governments, requirements of the federal government, and other past decisions have many times created state funding commitments that are almost impossible to change very much in the short run. Education funding levels are determined in many states partly by state and federal judicial decisions and state constitutional provisions, as well as by statutes. Federal mandates require that state Medicaid funding meet a specific minimum level if Medicaid is to exist at all in a state. Federal law affects environmental program spending, and both state and federal courts help determine state spending on prisons. Much state spending, therefore, cannot usefully be subjected to the kind of fundamental re-examination that ZBB in its original form envisions.\n\nTo the extent that ZBB has encouraged governors and legislators to take a hard look at the impact of incremental changes in state spending, it produced a significant improvement in state budgeting. But in its classic form \u2013 begin all budget evaluations from zero \u2013 ZBB is as unworkable as it ever was.\"\n\n=== Use in the Chinese Public Sector ===\nThe concept of ZBB was first introduced to China at the beginning of the 1990s and was primarily focused in the Hubei Province area of China. Just as the United States encountered many problems and failures with ZBB, China too ran into them as well. But even with the numerous problems and failures along the way, they have gradually adjusted appropriately since then to become more effective in using ZBB as a budget reform. Western influence on budgeting was non-existent in China before 1993. It was during the 1990s that China began looking out for a new and modern form of budgeting for their country\u2019s nationwide budget reform.  They ended up settling on ZBB.  A new policy was set in place to put ZBB into action, known as the DBR, or the Departmental Budgeting Reform. The DBR and ZBB were first implemented in the Hubei province of China. According to Jun Ma, a professor at the University of Nebraska, the beginning years of ZBB in Hubei were a bit rocky as the DBR had not yet been implemented into all the state departments in Hubei. Only a few departments implemented the budgeting system and the results of multiple departments using multiple budgeting systems were not good. It slowly became clear that using ZBB in a traditional sense would not work out. Officials in the Hubei province and the DBR began looking for ways to incorporate the best parts of ZBB and form a new budgeting system that would work for their needs. The result of this change was a Chinese-styled Target-Based Budgeting system. This form of budgeting required bureaucracies and agencies to submit a simple budget within a pre-set time limit. TBB, as a modified form of ZBB, has worked out moderately okay for the Chinese government in Hubei over the years, but many problems still face the budgeting system.\n\nSome number of issues ranging from the absence of a unified budget and certain expenditures that are somehow exempt from the ZBB process, to the influence or effects of political factors have been widely noted.\n# Absence of a Budget Unification- Though the Hubei Province has developed a thorough budget by combining expenditures and off-budget revenues into the budget, there yet remains certain types of expenses that are still under the control of certain individuals other than the government Finance Department. Because of this, the difficulty of prioritizing all the possible government programs becomes confusing.\n# Political Factor Influences- No matter what the term or whose term it is, political officials have always had a certain plan or change that they would like to implement that would greatly influence the prioritizing process of ZBB. Certain political officials could say they greatly support a certain program and would like the Finance Department to focus more money on that particular program whilst other political officials would think otherwise. Therefore, any real changes or improvements made will always face opposition unless you have unified political support. \n# Expenditure exemptions- Ranging from operating and personnel expenses to central government policies that are unfunded that start after the budget year, these are just to name a few things that are excluded from the ZBB process. By not including a large portion of spending into the ZBB process, the effectiveness potential of these reforms becomes greatly reduced. \nTwo notable reforms to the ZBB process include having departments submit budget requests and the use of sunset legislation.\n# Budget requests- These requests are to reflect (1) a cut of a certain percentage, (2) current level of spending, and (3) an increase of a certain percentage. This allows the opportunity of trading between departments of the funding of a lower priority of one department to a higher priority of another. \n# Sunset legislation- This process places a sense of urgency on certain programs implemented or that are currently being funded as that program shall be placed under review to determine efficiency & effectiveness, and see whether the public or government need this program.

The stamps were therefore to be [[commemorative stamp|commemoratives]], but they were also intended as [[Definitive stamp|definitives]] for regular use over an extended period of time.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nThe Maltese wanted to issue the new stamps by the time the new parliament was inaugurated on 1 November 1921. There was not enough time for the stamps to be produced and delivered within that timeframe, however, since the printers [[De La Rue]] had to deal with a large workload, causing delays. The Malta Post Office therefore decided to overprint the then-current definitives (which depicted King [[George V]] and some pictorial scenes, including the 1919 reprint of the 1899 Melita design) with the words \"SELF-GOVERNMENT\" diagonally to commemorate the new constitution.<ref name=\"bephila\"/> The overprinting was carried out by the Government Printing Office in the capital [[Valletta]], and the stamps were released between 12 January and 29 April 1922.<ref name=\"sg\"/>\n\n==Design==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 320\n | image_style = border:none;\n | image1 = Malta -mix- 2019 by-RaBoe 260.jpg\n | alt1 = A lighthouse\n | image2 = Gozo boat cropped.jpg\n | alt2 = Painting of a boat\n | footer = The St Elmo lighthouse and a [[Gozo boat]] (painting pictured) are depicted in the background of Caruana Dingli's design\n}}\n\nTwo designs were chosen from the competition, one by [[Edward Caruana Dingli (artist)|Edward Caruana Dingli]] and one by [[Gianni Vella]]. Caruana Dingli's design was used for ten denominations: the [[Penny|pence]] values ranging from \u00bcd to 6d, and also the highest value of the set, the [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]1. Vella's design was used for the five [[shilling]] values ranging from 1/- to 10/-.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nCaruana Dingli's design depicts [[Melita (personification)|Melita]] as a robed and helmeted figure holding a [[rudder]], representing Malta as being in control of her own destiny.<ref name=\"cbm-bullion\"/> The background contains a seascape, with the lighthouse near [[Fort Saint Elmo]] and a [[Gozo boat]] visible. Shields depicting the [[Union Jack]] and a colonial badge representing Malta are located at the bottom of the design.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nVella's design contains two figures representing Malta and the United Kingdom, Melita and [[Brittania]]. Melita holds an olive branch in her hand, and embraces Brittania by lifting her hand around Brittania's neck. Brittania wears a helmet and holds a shield with the Union Jack.

The typographed stamps were printed on chalk-surfaced paper. Each stamp was printed in two operations, with a [[Key type stamp|key plate and a duty plate]]. In most cases each plate was printed in a different colour, but for some of the low values both plates were printed in the same colour.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nThe [[watermark]] used on the stamps is known as ''Multiple Script CA'', since it consists of the letters \"CA\" (referring to the [[Crown Agents]]) in a script typeface, beneath a representation of the [[Tudor Crown (heraldry)|Tudor crown]], arranged multiple times next to each other. The watermark was sideways for the pence values and upright for the shilling values. The \u00a31 was initially printed with an upright watermark but in 1925 it was also issued with a sideways watermark.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nThe pence values were printed in sheets of 160 stamps (consisting of two panes, each containing 8 rows of 10 stamps, separated by a [[Gutter (philately)|gutter]]), the shilling values were printed in sheets of 80 (one pane of 8 rows of 10 stamps) and the \u00a31 value was printed in sheets of 40 (one pane of 4 rows of 10 stamps).<ref name=\"bephila\"/> The stamps were perforated with [[Perforation gauge|gauge]] 14.2 by 14 comb perforations.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nA number of [[Die proof (philately)|die proofs]] and plate proofs of stamps from the Melita issue exist. Die proofs are individual prints from the stamps' original [[Die (philately)|die]]s made at various stages of production, and are impressions of either the key die or the duty die of each value, or composite die proofs of both dies together. Plate proofs, which are test printings made from the stamps' printings plates, exist of the \u00bcd, \u00bdd, 1d, 3d and \u00a31 values in unissued colours. A wide range of versions of these exist, either perforated or imperforate, on unwatermarked or watermarked paper, and with or without a [[Specimen stamp|specimen overprint]]. Specimens of all the stamps in the issued colours also exist, except for the reprints made in slightly different shades, the 1925 2\u00bdd on 3d surcharge, and the 1926 postage overprints.<ref name=\"trory\"/>\n\n==Issued stamps==\n[[File:Stamp Malta 1924 1p.jpg|thumb|The 1d bright violet issued on 25 April 1924]]\n\nThe first Melita stamps were issued on 1 August 1922, with the denominations of \u00bdd, 1d, 6d, 1/- and 2/-.

They were [[commemorative stamp]]s since they celebrated the islands' new status as a [[self-governing colony]] following a new constitution in 1921, but also a [[Definitive stamp|definitive issue]] intended for regular use over an extended period of time.\n\nDesigned by two leading Maltese artists, [[Edward Caruana Dingli (artist)|Edward Caruana Dingli]] and [[Gianni Vella]], the issue consisted of stamps in various denominations from \u00bc[[pence|d]] to [[\u00a3sd|\u00a3]]1; Caruana Dingli's designs were used on the pence and pound values and Vella's design on the shilling values. The designs were poorly received when they were issued, and Caruana Dingli himself criticized the execution of the design. In subsequent years, however, Caruana Dingli's design came to be regarded as one of the most iconic Malta stamps, and his design for the figure of Melita formed the basis of the [[Maltese lira]] banknotes of 1989\u20132008 and gold [[bullion coin]]s minted since 2018.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Malta 1899 Melita 2s6d olive-grey.jpg|thumb|left|The 1899 Melita stamp]]\n\nThe oldest known depiction of a personification of Malta dates back to 1481.

This divided control of Malta between two governments: the Maltese Government and the Maltese Imperial Government. The former included a [[Bicameralism|bicameral legislature]] with a [[Senate of Malta|Senate]] and [[Parliament of Malta|Legislative Assembly]], while the Imperial Government was led by the [[List of Governors of Malta|Governor of Malta]], a British colonial official who retained direct responsibility of certain reserved matters such as defence and maintaining public order.<ref name=\"bephila\">{{cite web|title=Melita Issue of Malta Stamps: 1922\u201326|url=http://www.bephila.com/articles/melita-issue-of-malta-stamps-1922-26|website=British Empire Philately|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316113650/http://www.bephila.com/articles/melita-issue-of-malta-stamps-1922-26|archivedate=16 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cassar |first1=Carmel |title=A Concise History of Malta |date=2000 |publisher=Mireva Publications |location=[[Msida]] |isbn=1870579526 |page=204}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 June 1921, a [[design competition|competition]] was announced calling for the design of a set of stamps to commemorate Malta's partial independence. The stamps were therefore to be [[commemorative stamp|commemoratives]], but they were also intended as [[Definitive stamp|definitives]] for regular use over an extended period of time.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nThe Maltese wanted to issue the new stamps by the time the new parliament was inaugurated on 1 November 1921. There was not enough time for the stamps to be produced and delivered within that timeframe, however, since the printers [[De La Rue]] had to deal with a large workload, causing delays. The Malta Post Office therefore decided to overprint the then-current definitives (which depicted King [[George V]] and some pictorial scenes, including the 1919 reprint of the 1899 Melita design) with the words \"SELF-GOVERNMENT\" diagonally to commemorate the new constitution.<ref name=\"bephila\"/> The overprinting was carried out by the Government Printing Office in the capital [[Valletta]], and the stamps were released between 12 January and 29 April 1922.<ref name=\"sg\"/>\n\n==Design==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 320\n | image_style = border:none;\n | image1 = Malta -mix- 2019 by-RaBoe 260.jpg\n | alt1 = A lighthouse\n | image2 = Gozo boat cropped.jpg\n | alt2 = Painting of a boat\n | footer = The St Elmo lighthouse and a [[Gozo boat]] (painting pictured) are depicted in the background of Caruana Dingli's design\n}}\n\nTwo designs were chosen from the competition, one by [[Edward Caruana Dingli (artist)|Edward Caruana Dingli]] and one by [[Gianni Vella]]. Caruana Dingli's design was used for ten denominations: the [[Penny|pence]] values ranging from \u00bcd to 6d, and also the highest value of the set, the [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]1. Vella's design was used for the five [[shilling]] values ranging from 1/- to 10/-.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nCaruana Dingli's design depicts [[Melita (personification)|Melita]] as a robed and helmeted figure holding a [[rudder]], representing Malta as being in control of her own destiny.<ref name=\"cbm-bullion\"/> The background contains a seascape, with the lighthouse near [[Fort Saint Elmo]] and a [[Gozo boat]] visible.

The typographed stamps were printed on chalk-surfaced paper. Each stamp was printed in two operations, with a [[Key type stamp|key plate and a duty plate]]. In most cases each plate was printed in a different colour, but for some of the low values both plates were printed in the same colour.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nThe [[watermark]] used on the stamps is known as ''Multiple Script CA'', since it consists of the letters \"CA\" (referring to the [[Crown Agents]]) in a script typeface, beneath a representation of the [[Tudor Crown (heraldry)|Tudor crown]], arranged multiple times next to each other. The watermark was sideways for the pence values and upright for the shilling values. The \u00a31 was initially printed with an upright watermark but in 1925 it was also issued with a sideways watermark.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nThe pence values were printed in sheets of 160 stamps (consisting of two panes, each containing 8 rows of 10 stamps, separated by a [[Gutter (philately)|gutter]]), the shilling values were printed in sheets of 80 (one pane of 8 rows of 10 stamps) and the \u00a31 value was printed in sheets of 40 (one pane of 4 rows of 10 stamps).<ref name=\"bephila\"/> The stamps were perforated with [[Perforation gauge|gauge]] 14.2 by 14 comb perforations.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nA number of [[Die proof (philately)|die proofs]] and plate proofs of stamps from the Melita issue exist. Die proofs are individual prints from the stamps' original [[Die (philately)|die]]s made at various stages of production, and are impressions of either the key die or the duty die of each value, or composite die proofs of both dies together. Plate proofs, which are test printings made from the stamps' printings plates, exist of the \u00bcd, \u00bdd, 1d, 3d and \u00a31 values in unissued colours. A wide range of versions of these exist, either perforated or imperforate, on unwatermarked or watermarked paper, and with or without a [[Specimen stamp|specimen overprint]].
