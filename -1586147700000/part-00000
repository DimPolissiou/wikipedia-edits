The UNA was used for 15 out of the 16 planned languages (all except Aleutian).\n\nAfter 1937, the UNA was abandoned, and those languages that were to continue to have an official writing system were to adopt Cyrillic. In practice, this spelt the end of writing for many of these minority languages this halted their written use for decades to come.\n\n== References ==\n* Grenoble, L. A. (2003).

published in the UNA. The UNA was used for 15 out of the 16 planned languages (all except Aleutian).\n\nAfter 1937, the UNA was abandoned, and those languages that were to continue to have an official writing system were to adopt Cyrillic. In practice, this spelt the end of writing for many of these minority languages this halted their written use for decades to come.\n\n== References ==\n* Grenoble, L. A. (2003).

It consists of nuns ([[Sannyasa|Sannyasinis]] and Brahmacharinis) belonging to a monastic order for women. It was formed as per the instructions given by [[Swami Vivekananda]], a patriot-saint of India.<ref>''Swami Vivekananda's Dream, Sri Sarada Math'' (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 2005), p.7</ref> Fifty years after the passing away of Swami Vivekananda, in 1954, the Sri Sarada Math was established at Dakshineshwar, Kolkata with a group of eight nuns.\n\nThe headquarters of Sri Sarada Math is situated on the bank of Ganga in Dakshineshwar, Kolkata. Presently, the organisation has branch centres all over India, and in Sri Lanka and Australia.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/centers.php</ref>\n\nThe main aim of the organisation is to fulfil the mission of Swami Vivekananda, that is \u2018Shiva Jnane Jiva Seva\u2019 serving God in Man, irrespective of caste, creed and nationality as well as the upliftment and empowerment of women.<ref>http://srisaradamathrb.org/our-origin/</ref><ref>''Echoes of Vedanta in the far East'' (Ramakrishna Sarada Vedanta Societty of New South Wales: Australia, 1994), p.i)</ref>\n\nThe organisation mainly propagates the Hindu philosophy of Vedanta\u2013Advaita Vedanta and four yogic ideals\u2013jnana, bhakti, karma, and Raja Yoga.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, ''Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions'' (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref>\n\nApart from religious and spiritual teaching the organisation carries out extensive educational and philanthropic work in India. This aspect came to be a feature of many other Hindu movements. The mission bases its work on the principles of karma yoga, the principle of selfless work done with dedication to God. The Sri Sarada Math and its sister organisation, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission has centres around India, Sri Lanka, and Australia and publishes many important Vedanta and Ramakrishna-Vivekananda texts. Ramakrishna Sarada Mission, its sister organisation also shares the same headquarters at Dakshineshwar, Kolkata.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sri-Sarada-Math</ref>\n\n== Introduction ==\nSri Sarada Math is the monastic order for women established as an independent counterpart to [[Ramakrishna Order]].\n\n2 December 1954, the Sarada Math was inaugurated by the then President of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and [[Ramakrishna Mission]], Revered Swami Sankarananda.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.133</ref>  \nDuring its formative days, the women who joined this order was from a family of [[Sri Ramakrishna]] devotees, such as: Brahmacharini Renu, Brahmacharini Asha, Brahmacharini Lakshmi, Brahmacharini Gauri, Brahmacharini Kalyani and others. They were inspired to lead a life of renunciation.\n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in [[Udbodhan]] magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref> It created interest among intellectual circles, especially in the circles of Ramakrishna followers.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref>\n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.135</ref> The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates of the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math.

A manufacturer who builds fewer than 1000 vehicles per year uses a 9 as the third digit, and the 12th, 13th and 14th position of the VIN for a second part of the identification. Some manufacturers use the third character as a code for a vehicle category (e.g., bus or truck), a division within a manufacturer, or both. For example, within 1G (assigned to [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] in the United States), 1G1 represents [[Chevrolet]] passenger cars; 1G2, [[Pontiac]] passenger cars; and 1GC, Chevrolet [[truck]]s.\n\nThe [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE) in the US assigns WMIs to countries and manufacturers.<ref name=ISO3780>{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/45844.html |title=ISO 3780:2009 Road vehicles \u2013 World manufacturer identifier (WMI) code |publisher=[[ISO]] |date=2009-10-05 |access-date=2010-09-27}}</ref>\n\nThe first character of the WMI is the region in which the manufacturer is located. In practice, each is assigned to a country of manufacture, although in Europe the country where the continental headquarters is located can assign the WMI to all vehicles produced in that region (Example: Opel/Vauxhall cars whether produced in Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom or Poland carry a WMI of ''W0L'' because Adam Opel AG is based in R\u00fcsselsheim, Germany).\n\nIn the notation below, assume that letters precede numbers and that zero is the last number.

This is used, according to local regulations, to identify the vehicle type, and may include information on the [[automobile platform]] used, the model, and the [[car body styles|body style]]. Each manufacturer has a unique system for using this field. Most manufacturers since the 1980s have used the eighth digit to identify the engine type whenever there is more than one engine choice for the vehicle. Example: for the 2007 [[Chevrolet Corvette]], U is for a 6.0-liter [[V8 engine|V8]] engine, and E is for a 7.0&nbsp;L V8.\n\n====North American check digits====\nOne element that is inconsistent is the use of position nine as a [[#Check-digit calculation|check digit]], compulsory for vehicles in North America and China, but not Europe.\n\n===Vehicle identifier section===\nThe 10th to 17th positions are used as the 'vehicle identifier section' (VIS). This is used by the manufacturer to identify the individual vehicle in question. This may include information on options installed or engine and transmission choices, but often is a simple sequential number. In North America, the last five digits must be numeric.\n\n====Model year encoding====\nOne consistent element of the VIS is the 10th digit, which is required worldwide to encode the [[#Model year encoding|model year]] of the vehicle. Besides the three letters that are not allowed in the VIN itself (I, O and Q), the letters U and Z and the digit 0 are not used for the [[model year]] code. The year code is the model year for the vehicle.\n\nThe year 1980 was encoded by some manufacturers, especially [[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]], as \"A\" (since the 17-digit VIN was not mandatory until 1981, and the \"A\" or zero was in the manufacturer's pre-1981 placement in the VIN), yet [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] still used a zero for 1980. Subsequent years increment through the allowed letters, so that \"Y\" represents the year 2000. 2001 to 2009 are encoded as the digits 1 to 9, and subsequent years are encoded as \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", etc.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

There are three notable changes to the VIN structure that affect VIN deciphering systems:\n* The make may only be identified after looking at positions one through three and another position, as determined by the manufacturer in the second section or fourth to eighth segment of the VIN.\n* In order to identify the exact year in passenger cars and multipurpose passenger vehicles with a GVWR of 10,000 or less, one must read position 7 as well as position 10. For passenger cars, and for multipurpose passenger vehicles and trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}} or less, if position seven is numeric, the model year in position 10 of the VIN refers to a year in the range 1980\u20132009.{{Citation needed|reason=Seems wrong as e.g. a 2013 Volvo V60 has YV1xxx7xxDxxxxxxx|date=May 2017}} If position seven is alphabetic, the model year in position 10 of VIN refers to a year in the range 2010\u20132039.\n* The model year for vehicles with a GVWR greater than {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}}, as well as buses, motorcycles, trailers and low-speed vehicles, may no longer be identified within a 30-year range. VIN characters 1\u20138 and 10 that were assigned from 1980\u20132009 can be repeated beginning with the 2010 model year.\n\n====Plant code====\nCompulsory in North America and China is the use of the 11th character to identify the assembly plant at which the vehicle was built. Each manufacturer has its own set of plant codes.\n\n====Production number====\nIn the United States and China, the 12th to 17th digits are the vehicle's serial or production number. This is unique to each vehicle, and every manufacturer uses its own sequence.\n\n==Check-digit calculation==\nA check-digit validation is used for all road vehicles sold in the United States and Canada.\n\nWhen trying to validate a VIN with a [[check digit]], first either (a) remove the check digit for the purpose of calculation or (b) use a weight of zero (see [[#Weights used in calculation|below]]) to cancel it out. The original value of the check digit is then compared with the calculated value. If the calculated value is 0\u20139, the check digit must match the calculated value. If the calculated value is 10, the check digit must be X. If the two values do not match (and there was no error in the calculation), then there is a mistake in the VIN. However, a match does not prove the VIN is correct, because there is still a 1/11 chance that any two distinct VINs have a matching check digit: for example, the valid VINs <tt>5GZCZ43D13S812715</tt> (correct with leading five) and <tt>SGZCZ43D13S812715</tt> (incorrect with leading character \"S\"). The VINs in the Porsche image, <tt>WP0ZZZ99ZTS392124</tt>, and the GM-T body image, <tt>KLATF08Y1VB363636</tt>, do not pass the North American check-digit verification.\n\n===Transliterating the numbers===\nTransliteration consists of removing all of the letters, and replacing them with their appropriate numerical counterparts. These numerical alternatives (based on IBM's [[EBCDIC]]) are in the following chart. ''I'', ''O'', and ''Q'' are not allowed in a valid VIN; for this chart, they have been filled in with ''N/A'' (''not applicable''). Numerical digits use their own values.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Transliteration key:&nbsp;values for VIN decoding\n|'''A''': 1 ||'''B''': 2 ||'''C''': 3 ||'''D''': 4 ||'''E''': 5 ||'''F''': 6 ||'''G''': 7 ||'''H''': 8 ||'''I''': {{n/a}}\n|-\n|'''J''': 1 ||'''K''': 2 ||'''L''': 3 ||'''M''': 4 ||'''N''': 5 ||'''O''': {{n/a}} ||'''P''': 7 ||'''Q''': {{n/a}} ||'''R''': 9\n|-\n|{{n/a}} ||'''S''': 2 ||'''T''': 3 ||'''U''': 4 ||'''V''': 5 || '''W''': 6||'''X''': 7 ||'''Y''': 8 || '''Z''': 9\n|}\n\n''S'' is 2, and not 1. There is no left-alignment linearity.\n\n===Weights used in calculation===\nThe following is the weight factor for each position in the VIN. The 9th position is that of the check digit.

In this example, the remainder is 10, so the check digit is transliterated as ''X''.\n\nWith a check digit of ''X'', the VIN <tt>1M8GDM9A_KP042788</tt> is written <tt>1M8GDM9A''X''KP042788</tt>.\n\nA VIN with ''straight-ones'' (seventeen consecutive ''1''s) has the nice feature that its check digit ''1'' matches the calculated value ''1''. This is because a value of one multiplied by 89 (sum of weights) is 89, and 89 divided by 11 is 8 with remainder {{frac|1|11}}; thus 1 is the check digit. This is a way to test a VIN-check algorithm.\n\n\n==VIN scanning==\nVIN is printed on locations like bottom corner of the windshield on the driver\u2019s side, under the bonnet next to latch, the front end of the vehicle frame and inside the door pillar on the driver\u2019s side.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://info.gapless.app/en/blog/what-is-a-vin-why-its-important-to-know-your-cars-vehicle-identification-number/|title=What is a VIN?

A manufacturer who builds fewer than 1000 vehicles per year uses a 9 as the third digit, and the 12th, 13th and 14th position of the VIN for a second part of the identification. Some manufacturers use the third character as a code for a vehicle category (e.g., bus or truck), a division within a manufacturer, or both. For example, within 1G (assigned to [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] in the United States), 1G1 represents [[Chevrolet]] passenger cars; 1G2, [[Pontiac]] passenger cars; and 1GC, Chevrolet [[truck]]s.\n\nThe [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE) in the US assigns WMIs to countries and manufacturers.<ref name=ISO3780>{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/45844.html |title=ISO 3780:2009 Road vehicles \u2013 World manufacturer identifier (WMI) code |publisher=[[ISO]] |date=2009-10-05 |access-date=2010-09-27}}</ref>\n\nThe first character of the WMI is the region in which the manufacturer is located. In practice, each is assigned to a country of manufacture, although in Europe the country where the continental headquarters is located can assign the WMI to all vehicles produced in that region (Example: Opel/Vauxhall cars whether produced in Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom or Poland carry a WMI of ''W0L'' because Adam Opel AG is based in R\u00fcsselsheim, Germany).\n\nIn the notation below, assume that letters precede numbers and that zero is the last number.

This is used, according to local regulations, to identify the vehicle type, and may include information on the [[automobile platform]] used, the model, and the [[car body styles|body style]]. Each manufacturer has a unique system for using this field. Most manufacturers since the 1980s have used the eighth digit to identify the engine type whenever there is more than one engine choice for the vehicle. Example: for the 2007 [[Chevrolet Corvette]], U is for a 6.0-liter [[V8 engine|V8]] engine, and E is for a 7.0&nbsp;L V8.\n\n====North American check digits====\nOne element that is inconsistent is the use of position nine as a [[#Check-digit calculation|check digit]], compulsory for vehicles in North America and China, but not Europe.\n\n===Vehicle identifier section===\nThe 10th to 17th positions are used as the 'vehicle identifier section' (VIS). This is used by the manufacturer to identify the individual vehicle in question. This may include information on options installed or engine and transmission choices, but often is a simple sequential number. In North America, the last five digits must be numeric.\n\n====Model year encoding====\nOne consistent element of the VIS is the 10th digit, which is required worldwide to encode the [[#Model year encoding|model year]] of the vehicle. Besides the three letters that are not allowed in the VIN itself (I, O and Q), the letters U and Z and the digit 0 are not used for the [[model year]] code. The year code is the model year for the vehicle.\n\nThe year 1980 was encoded by some manufacturers, especially [[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]], as \"A\" (since the 17-digit VIN was not mandatory until 1981, and the \"A\" or zero was in the manufacturer's pre-1981 placement in the VIN), yet [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] still used a zero for 1980. Subsequent years increment through the allowed letters, so that \"Y\" represents the year 2000. 2001 to 2009 are encoded as the digits 1 to 9, and subsequent years are encoded as \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", etc.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

There are three notable changes to the VIN structure that affect VIN deciphering systems:\n* The make may only be identified after looking at positions one through three and another position, as determined by the manufacturer in the second section or fourth to eighth segment of the VIN.\n* In order to identify the exact year in passenger cars and multipurpose passenger vehicles with a GVWR of 10,000 or less, one must read position 7 as well as position 10. For passenger cars, and for multipurpose passenger vehicles and trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}} or less, if position seven is numeric, the model year in position 10 of the VIN refers to a year in the range 1980\u20132009.{{Citation needed|reason=Seems wrong as e.g. a 2013 Volvo V60 has YV1xxx7xxDxxxxxxx|date=May 2017}} If position seven is alphabetic, the model year in position 10 of VIN refers to a year in the range 2010\u20132039.\n* The model year for vehicles with a GVWR greater than {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}}, as well as buses, motorcycles, trailers and low-speed vehicles, may no longer be identified within a 30-year range. VIN characters 1\u20138 and 10 that were assigned from 1980\u20132009 can be repeated beginning with the 2010 model year.\n\n====Plant code====\nCompulsory in North America and China is the use of the 11th character to identify the assembly plant at which the vehicle was built. Each manufacturer has its own set of plant codes.\n\n====Production number====\nIn the United States and China, the 12th to 17th digits are the vehicle's serial or production number. This is unique to each vehicle, and every manufacturer uses its own sequence.\n\n==Check-digit calculation==\nA check-digit validation is used for all road vehicles sold in the United States and Canada.\n\nWhen trying to validate a VIN with a [[check digit]], first either (a) remove the check digit for the purpose of calculation or (b) use a weight of zero (see [[#Weights used in calculation|below]]) to cancel it out. The original value of the check digit is then compared with the calculated value. If the calculated value is 0\u20139, the check digit must match the calculated value. If the calculated value is 10, the check digit must be X. If the two values do not match (and there was no error in the calculation), then there is a mistake in the VIN. However, a match does not prove the VIN is correct, because there is still a 1/11 chance that any two distinct VINs have a matching check digit: for example, the valid VINs <tt>5GZCZ43D13S812715</tt> (correct with leading five) and <tt>SGZCZ43D13S812715</tt> (incorrect with leading character \"S\"). The VINs in the Porsche image, <tt>WP0ZZZ99ZTS392124</tt>, and the GM-T body image, <tt>KLATF08Y1VB363636</tt>, do not pass the North American check-digit verification.\n\n===Transliterating the numbers===\nTransliteration consists of removing all of the letters, and replacing them with their appropriate numerical counterparts. These numerical alternatives (based on IBM's [[EBCDIC]]) are in the following chart. ''I'', ''O'', and ''Q'' are not allowed in a valid VIN; for this chart, they have been filled in with ''N/A'' (''not applicable''). Numerical digits use their own values.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Transliteration key:&nbsp;values for VIN decoding\n|'''A''': 1 ||'''B''': 2 ||'''C''': 3 ||'''D''': 4 ||'''E''': 5 ||'''F''': 6 ||'''G''': 7 ||'''H''': 8 ||'''I''': {{n/a}}\n|-\n|'''J''': 1 ||'''K''': 2 ||'''L''': 3 ||'''M''': 4 ||'''N''': 5 ||'''O''': {{n/a}} ||'''P''': 7 ||'''Q''': {{n/a}} ||'''R''': 9\n|-\n|{{n/a}} ||'''S''': 2 ||'''T''': 3 ||'''U''': 4 ||'''V''': 5 || '''W''': 6||'''X''': 7 ||'''Y''': 8 || '''Z''': 9\n|}\n\n''S'' is 2, and not 1. There is no left-alignment linearity.\n\n===Weights used in calculation===\nThe following is the weight factor for each position in the VIN. The 9th position is that of the check digit. It has been substituted with a 0, which will cancel it out in the multiplication step.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+style=\"white-space:nowrap\"| Weight factor table\n|-\n!Position\n||1||2||3||4||5||6||7||8||9||10||11||12||13||14||15||16||17\n|-\n!Weight\n||8||7||6||5||4||3||2||10||{{no2}}0||9||8||7||6||5||4||3||2\n|}\n\n===Worked example===\nConsider the hypothetical VIN 1M8GDM9A_KP042788, where the underscore will be the check digit.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:1.2em;font-family:monospace\"\n|-\n!VIN\n||1||M||8||G||D||M||9||A|| ||K||P||0||4||2||7||8||8\n|-\n!Value\n||1||4||8||7||4||4||9||1||0||2||7||0||4||2||7||8||8\n|-\n!Weight\n||8||7||6||5||4||3||2||10||0||9||8||7||6||5||4||3||2\n|-\n!Products\n||8&nbsp;||28||48||35||16||12||18||10||0&nbsp;||18||56||0&nbsp;||24||10||28||24||16\n|}\n\n# The VIN's value is calculated from the above transliteration table. This number is used in the rest of the calculation.\n# Copy the ''weights'' from the above weight factor table.\n# The ''products'' row is the result of the multiplication of the vertical columns: ''Value'' and ''Weight.''\n# The products (8, 28, 48, 35 ... 24, 16) are all added together to yield a sum, ''351''.\n# Find the remainder after dividing by 11<br/>351 [[modulo operation|MOD]] 11 = 10<br/>351 \u00f7 11 = 31 <sup>'''10'''</sup>/<sub>11</sub>\n# The remainder is the check digit. If the remainder is 10, the check digit is X. In this example, the remainder is 10, so the check digit is transliterated as ''X''.\n\nWith a check digit of ''X'', the VIN <tt>1M8GDM9A_KP042788</tt> is written <tt>1M8GDM9A''X''KP042788</tt>.\n\nA VIN with ''straight-ones'' (seventeen consecutive ''1''s) has the nice feature that its check digit ''1'' matches the calculated value ''1''. This is because a value of one multiplied by 89 (sum of weights) is 89, and 89 divided by 11 is 8 with remainder {{frac|1|11}}; thus 1 is the check digit. This is a way to test a VIN-check algorithm.\n\n\n==VIN scanning==\nVIN is printed on locations like bottom corner of the windshield on the driver\u2019s side, under the bonnet next to latch, the front end of the vehicle frame and inside the door pillar on the driver\u2019s side.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://info.gapless.app/en/blog/what-is-a-vin-why-its-important-to-know-your-cars-vehicle-identification-number/|title=What is a VIN?

For example, in Mechanical Method and Trend Indicator,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trading Systems and Methods|last=Kaufman|first=Perry J.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2013|isbn=9781118043561|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}</ref> Gann drew attention to the price level (\u00a2103) on 16 April 1925, \u201cApr 16 low 103, down 79\u00bd cents from 182\u00bd and nearing $1.00 per bushel, a natural support level\u2014Time to watch for change in trend.\u201d<ref name=\":19\" /> Coincidentally, 103\u00b0 (or 13\u00b0 Cancer) was where the heliocentric Mars and Pluto were in conjunction on that day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Nautical Almanac And Astronomical Ephemeris for the Year 1925|last=Commissioners Of Longitude|first=|publisher=The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|year=1922|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nGann also used scales other than 1 dollar or point per 1 degree.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://ganntrade6.com/wp-content/uploads/Coffee.pdf|title=May Coffee Santos D|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|date=19 Mar 1954|website=|access-date=14 Feb 2018}}</ref> Two notable scales are $12 and $30 to one degree, because the two largest planets in the solar system, Jupiter and Saturn, take approximately 12 and 30 years to orbit the Sun respectively.<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example again, it would become 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0, which are 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 Aries in terms of zodiac. Gann also uses a scale of $0.07 ($1/15) to 1 degree, which is based on the Earth's rotation in 24 hours (for 24 times 15\u00b0 is 360\u00b0).<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example, $120 times 15 will be 1800\u00b0, and when it is divided by 360\u00b0, the remainder is 0.

The most important angle Gann called the 1x1 or the 45\u00b0 angle, which he said represented one unit of price for one unit of time.

Substitute P with 36 into the above formula:\n\nA\u2084\u2084 = MOD[210\u00b0\u00d744<sup>\u00bd</sup>\u2212180\u00b0,360\u00b0] = 132.98\u00b0 which is roughly equal to 120\u00b0 on the chart.\n\nConversely, to calculate price P given the angle A on the n\u1d57\u02b0 layer of the Hexagon Chart:\n\nP\u2099 = {[(n+\u00bd)\u00d7360\u00b0+A]\u00f7210\u00b0}\u00b2 where n = 0,1,2,3\u2026\n\n====== Method 2 ======\nTo find the exact angle on the Hexagon Chart, one has to use a slightly more complicated formula below.\n\nA\u209a = 180\u00b0\u2212(3r\u2092\u00b2\u2212P)\u00d760\u00b0\u00f7r\u2092\n\nWhere r\u2092 is the smallest natural number greater than (P\u00f73)<sup>\u00bd</sup>\n\nLet us take 44 as an example:\n\n(44/3)<sup>\u00bd</sup> = 3.8297, r\u2092 = 4\n\nA\u2084\u2084 = 180\u00b0\u2212(3\u00d74\u00b2-44)\u00d760\u00b0\u00f74 = 120\u00b0\n\nConversely, to calculate price P given the angle A on the n\u1d57\u02b0 layer of the Hexagon Chart:\n\nP\u2099 = 3n\u00b2\u2212(180\u00b0\u2212 A\u00d7n\u00f760\u00b0)\n\n==== Practical examples ====\n[[File:The_Hexagon_Chart_and_the_Corn_Market_Top_in_March_1925.jpg|thumb|300x300px|In March, Saturn was at 224\u00b0 and Venus was at 344\u00b0. The corn top price was \u00a2137, which was around 104\u00b0, thus the three points loosely formed a Grand Trine.]]\nAccording to Patrick Mikula,<ref name=\":3\" /> the rule of using the Spiral Chart or the Hexagon Chart is as follows:\n\n# Identify the planetary combination(s) which governs the price movements of the commodity. For example, as stated above, corn is sensitive to Venus and Saturn.\n# Look for a date when the planetary combinations ruling the commodity makes a major [[astrological aspect]], like opposition, trine and square.\n# Overlay the Spiral or Hexagon Chart onto the horoscope in the following way:\n#* On the Spiral Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 1, 2, 11, 28, 53 and so on.\n#* On the Hexagon Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 0, 6, 18, 36, 60 and so on.\n# Find the current price on the Spiral or Hexagon Chart. For example, $36 is roughly at 135\u00b0 on the Spiral Chart, and at 0\u00b0 on the Hexagon Chart.\n# See if the price makes any aspect to the planetary combination:\n#* If the combination involves Jupiter, then compare the angle of the price to Jupiter;\n#* Else, compare to the outer planet of the two.\n#* In the case of Venus-Saturn, since Jupiter is not involved, the price is compared against Saturn.\n# If the price makes an important aspect to Jupiter or the outer planet, then a turning point may have been reached.\n#* The important aspects in the Spiral Chart are the multiples of 45\u00b0 and 120\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 315\u00b0.\n#* The important aspects in the Hexagon Chart are the multiples of 60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 300\u00b0\n# By repeated experimentation, the trader can determine with chart (Spiral or Hexagon) works better on which commodity, and so forth.\n\nHere are a few actual trading examples in Corn given by Gann in ''How to Make Profits Trading in Commodities: A Study of the Commodity Market''.<ref name=\":6\" /> As stated earlier, Gann thought that the price of corn was influenced by the aspects of Venus and Saturn, thus the angle of the price on the Hexagon Chart is compared against Saturn.

The first one is that, when a planet returns to its position during a recent eclipse, then trend is likely to change.<ref name=\":3\" /> The second way is that when a planet crosses an eclipse spot which happens during a market top or bottom, then the down or up move will accelerate.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Planetary averages ===\nGann maintained two formulas for calculating planetary averages.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> The first one is called the Mean of Five (MOF), which is arithmetic mean of the geocentric and heliocentric longitudes of the outer five planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The other is called the Cycle of Eight (COE), which include all eight planets in its calculation, using both geocentric and heliocentric longitudes (the Sun replaces the Earth in the geocentric calculation). He thinks that when these averaged values make an aspect to the price, it will create support or resistance.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Personal view on religion ==\nEven though Gann was thought to be \u201creligious\u201d,<ref name=\":1\" /> a careful analysis of his writings finds that he did not agree with the conventional Christian teachings. On page 99 to 100 of his novel ''[[The Tunnel Thru the Air; Or, Looking Back from 1940|The Tunnel Thru the Air]]'' (1927),<ref name=\":0\" /> Gann revealed some of his personal believes towards religion through a conversation between the protagonist, Robert Gordon, and his mother:\n\n\u201cShe talked to Robert of his future and told him she hoped he would be a preacher. Robert confided to her that he could never be an orthodox minister, for he could not preach and teach the things which the orthodox ministers were teaching. He did not believe in a personal devil or believe in Hell, but believed in a God of Love and Justice. He did not believe that God would inflict upon any of his children eternal punishment but thought that whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap and that we receive our reward here upon earth.\n\n\u201cHe told her that the Bible plainly said that the kingdom of heaven is within us and he believed it. If we kept our conscience clear and did unto others as we would like to have them do unto us, he believed we would find our heaven and our reward here upon earth. Said that times and conditions were changing rapidly; that the new inventions and discoveries caused men to think differently than in the old days; that the old religious ideas would pass away and give place to more liberal, advanced ideas. He hoped to live to see the day when men would not only be too proud to fight, but would be too full of love for their fellowman to settle disputes with the sword. This was God's plan and it would come to pass this way, and he believed that he could be a great power for peace and hoped to live to see a world of peace with all nations united under one kingdom and one God, the God of Love and Justice.\u201d\n\nTwenty-three years later, on page 21 of his book ''The Magic Word'' (1950),<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Magic Word|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|publisher=Lambert Gann|year=1950|isbn=|location=Pomeroy, WA|pages=}}</ref> he expressed similar ideas:\n\n\u201cThe Bible is simple when rightly understood. It teaches the Divine Law, its uses and abuses. Whether a law is divine or natural, it is made plain that if you disobey the law, you must pay the penalty and if you obey or follow the law, your reward is certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bible does not teach reward after death but promises reward or a reaping now while you are here on this earth. Jesus said, \u2018As ye sow, also shall ye reap.\u2019 He did not say \u2018after death\u2019 but here and now. Too many have preached that we should live a life of sacrifice here on earth and wait until after death to receive the reward. This is not what people want. They want something practical. They want to receive their reward here on earth. If they put forth the right effort, they want to know that they will receive the reward here on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll natural laws teach and prove that we do get our reward on this earth. Job obeyed the law and got twice as much as he had while he was still on earth. There is nothing in the Bible that says these laws will not work today and I shall prove by the Bible that they do.\u201d\n\n== Controversy ==\nThere has been a general disagreement whether Gann himself made profits by speculation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneystockstycoons.com/articles/w-d-gann-fraud-or-trading-genius-part-2/|title=W.D.

Gann's Mechanical Method and Trend Indicator (1946), in which Gann drew attention to the price level (\u00a2103) on 16 April 1925, and 103\u00b0 is also where the heliocentric Mars and Pluto were on that day.]]\nOne of the most controversial techniques that Gann used is that he converted the price directly to zodiac degrees.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> For example, if a commodity is trading at $120 per share, he would convert it to 120\u00b0 of the zodiac, which is 0\u00b0 Leo. If the price makes a [[Astrological aspect|major aspect]] (e.g. conjunction, trine, square, etc.), then it is believed that the price will reach a short-term top or bottom.\n\nWhen a price, after converting into a degree in the longitude, is in aspect with the planets, the trend is likely to change. For example, in Mechanical Method and Trend Indicator,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trading Systems and Methods|last=Kaufman|first=Perry J.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2013|isbn=9781118043561|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}</ref> Gann drew attention to the price level (\u00a2103) on 16 April 1925, \u201cApr 16 low 103, down 79\u00bd cents from 182\u00bd and nearing $1.00 per bushel, a natural support level\u2014Time to watch for change in trend.\u201d<ref name=\":19\" /> Coincidentally, 103\u00b0 (or 13\u00b0 Cancer) was where the heliocentric Mars and Pluto were in conjunction on that day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Nautical Almanac And Astronomical Ephemeris for the Year 1925|last=Commissioners Of Longitude|first=|publisher=The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|year=1922|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nGann also used scales other than 1 dollar or point per 1 degree.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://ganntrade6.com/wp-content/uploads/Coffee.pdf|title=May Coffee Santos D|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|date=19 Mar 1954|website=|access-date=14 Feb 2018}}</ref> Two notable scales are $12 and $30 to one degree, because the two largest planets in the solar system, Jupiter and Saturn, take approximately 12 and 30 years to orbit the Sun respectively.<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example again, it would become 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0, which are 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 Aries in terms of zodiac. Gann also uses a scale of $0.07 ($1/15) to 1 degree, which is based on the Earth's rotation in 24 hours (for 24 times 15\u00b0 is 360\u00b0).<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example, $120 times 15 will be 1800\u00b0, and when it is divided by 360\u00b0, the remainder is 0.

The most important angle Gann called the 1x1 or the 45\u00b0 angle, which he said represented one unit of price for one unit of time. When one draws a perfect square and then draw a diagonal line from one corner of the square to the other, it illustrates the concept of the 1x1 angle which moves up one point per day.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PxYA1U7JZ6oC&pg=PA26&dq=%27%27The+Basis+of+My+Forecasting+Method%27%27+gann&client=firefox-a\n|title=Forecasting profits using price & time\n|last=Gately\n|first=Edward\n|publisher=John Wiley and Sons\n|year=1998\n|accessdate=2009-03-25\n}}\n</ref><ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Fibonacci Analysis|last=Brown|first=Constance M.|publisher=Bloomberg Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1576602614|location=New York, NY|pages=}}</ref>\n\nHere is an example from a private letter of Gann to a client on the coffee market:<ref name=\":5\" />\n* The high in the May Coffee Santos D on 19 March 1954 was 8729.\n* The low on 16 April 1932 was 435.

Substitute P with 73 into the above formula:\n\nA\u2087\u2083 = MOD[180\u00b0\u00d7(73\u22121)<sup>\u00bd</sup>\u2212225\u00b0,360\u00b0] = MOD[180\u00d78.4853\u2212225,360]\u00b0 = 222.35\u00b0, which is close to 225\u00b0.\n\nConversely, to calculate price P given the angle A on the n\u1d57\u02b0 layer of the Spiral Chart:\n\nP\u2099 = 1+{[(n+\u215d)\u00d7360\u00b0+A]\u00f7180\u00b0}\u00b2\n\n====== Method 2 ======\nTo find the exact angle on the spiral chart, one has to use a slightly more complicated formula below.\n\nA\u209a = 315\u00b0\u2212(r\u2092\u00b2\u2212P)\u00d745\u00b0\u00f7n\n\nWhere:\n\nP = The price of which the angle is to be found\n\nr\u2092 = The smallest odd number higher than the square root of P\n\nn = (r\u2092\u22121)\u00f72 or the chart layer on which P locates\n\nTaking 73 as an example again:\n\nSince 73<sup>\u00bd</sup> \u2245 8.544, so r\u2092 = 9 > 8.544\n\nn = (9-1)\u00f72 = 4\n\nA\u2087\u2083 = 315\u00b0\u2212(9\u00b2\u221273)\u00d745\u00b0\u00f74 = 315\u00b0\u2212 90\u00b0 = 225\u00b0\n\nConversely, to calculate price P given the angle A on the n\u1d57\u02b0 layer of the Spiral Chart:\n\nP\u2099 = (2n+1)\u00b2\u2212(315\u00b0\u2212A\u00d7n\u00f745\u00b0)\n\n===== Anecdote =====\nOn p.69 of Gann\u2019s novel [[The Tunnel Thru the Air; Or, Looking Back from 1940|The Tunnel Thru the Air; Or, Looking back from 1940]] (1927), the numbers \u201c1940\u201d and \u201c69\u201d lined up at the top of the page.<ref name=\":0\" /> Incidentally, the sequence 19, 40, 69 appeared on one of the cardinal axes of the Spiral Chart.

Gann|300x300px]]Very similar to the Spiral Chart, the Hexagon Chart is also a matrix of consecutive natural numbers, but the difference is that it starts with 0 in the central point, and the numbers spiral out in the form of a hexagon instead a square.<ref name=\":3\" /> The spiral direction in Gann's original course is also counterclockwise, because of its astrological overlay.<ref name=\":4\" /> Mathematically, the numbers in each additional layer represent the [[hexagonal number]]s, which are the number of distinct dots consisting of the outlines of regular hexagons.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wonders of Numbers: Adventures in Mathematics, Mind, and Meaning|last=Pickover|first=Clifford A.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0195157994|location=New York: NY|pages=}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, it is found that Gann used the following method to overlay planetary positions on the Hexagon Chart:<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n* The axis going from 0 to 1,11, 28, and so on are 60\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]].\n* The axis going from 0 to 2, 10, 24, and so on are 120\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]].\n* The axis going from 0 to 3, 12, 27, and so on are 180\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]].\n* The axis going from 0 to 4, 14, 30, and so on are 240\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]].\n* The axis going from 0 to 5, 16, 33, and so on are 300\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]].\n* The axis going from 0 to 6, 18, 36, and so on are 0\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]].\n\nAgain, the above mathematical relationship could be demonstrated by this mathematical formula:<ref name=\":18\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Integers on the cardinal angles (60\u00b0\u00d7) of the Hexagon Chart\n!{{diagonal split header|Layer|Degree}}\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |60\u00b0\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |120\u00b0\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |180\u00b0\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |240\u00b0\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |300\u00b0\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |360\u00b0\n|-\n!1\n|1\n|2\n|3\n|4\n|5\n|6\n|-\n!2\n|8\n|10\n|12\n|14\n|16\n|18\n|-\n!3\n|21\n|24\n|27\n|30\n|33\n|36\n|-\n!4\n|40\n|44\n|48\n|52\n|56\n|60\n|-\n!5\n|65\n|70\n|75\n|80\n|85\n|90\n|-\n!n\n|3n\u00b2\u22122n\n|3n\u00b2\u2212n\n|3n\u00b2\n|3n\u00b2+n\n|3n\u00b2+2n\n|3(n\u00b2+n)\n|}\n\n===== Mathematical formula of the Hexagon Chart =====\nLike the Spiral Chart, there are two methods of calculation.<ref name=\":13\" /> The first one is simpler not as accurate as the second one.\n\n====== Method 1 ======\nSimilar to the Spiral Chart, for any natural number P>1, its approximate angular value A (in degrees) is given by:\n\nA\u209a = MOD[210\u00b0\u00d7P<sup>\u00bd</sup>\u2212180\u00b0,360\u00b0]\n\nFor example, from the Hexagon Chart, it is known that the angular value of 44 is 120\u00b0. Substitute P with 36 into the above formula:\n\nA\u2084\u2084 = MOD[210\u00b0\u00d744<sup>\u00bd</sup>\u2212180\u00b0,360\u00b0] = 132.98\u00b0 which is roughly equal to 120\u00b0 on the chart.\n\nConversely, to calculate price P given the angle A on the n\u1d57\u02b0 layer of the Hexagon Chart:\n\nP\u2099 = {[(n+\u00bd)\u00d7360\u00b0+A]\u00f7210\u00b0}\u00b2 where n = 0,1,2,3\u2026\n\n====== Method 2 ======\nTo find the exact angle on the Hexagon Chart, one has to use a slightly more complicated formula below.\n\nA\u209a = 180\u00b0\u2212(3r\u2092\u00b2\u2212P)\u00d760\u00b0\u00f7r\u2092\n\nWhere r\u2092 is the smallest natural number greater than (P\u00f73)<sup>\u00bd</sup>\n\nLet us take 44 as an example:\n\n(44/3)<sup>\u00bd</sup> = 3.8297, r\u2092 = 4\n\nA\u2084\u2084 = 180\u00b0\u2212(3\u00d74\u00b2-44)\u00d760\u00b0\u00f74 = 120\u00b0\n\nConversely, to calculate price P given the angle A on the n\u1d57\u02b0 layer of the Hexagon Chart:\n\nP\u2099 = 3n\u00b2\u2212(180\u00b0\u2212 A\u00d7n\u00f760\u00b0)\n\n==== Practical examples ====\n[[File:The_Hexagon_Chart_and_the_Corn_Market_Top_in_March_1925.jpg|thumb|300x300px|In March, Saturn was at 224\u00b0 and Venus was at 344\u00b0. The corn top price was \u00a2137, which was around 104\u00b0, thus the three points loosely formed a Grand Trine.]]\nAccording to Patrick Mikula,<ref name=\":3\" /> the rule of using the Spiral Chart or the Hexagon Chart is as follows:\n\n# Identify the planetary combination(s) which governs the price movements of the commodity. For example, as stated above, corn is sensitive to Venus and Saturn.\n# Look for a date when the planetary combinations ruling the commodity makes a major [[astrological aspect]], like opposition, trine and square.\n# Overlay the Spiral or Hexagon Chart onto the horoscope in the following way:\n#* On the Spiral Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 1, 2, 11, 28, 53 and so on.\n#* On the Hexagon Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 0, 6, 18, 36, 60 and so on.\n# Find the current price on the Spiral or Hexagon Chart. For example, $36 is roughly at 135\u00b0 on the Spiral Chart, and at 0\u00b0 on the Hexagon Chart.\n# See if the price makes any aspect to the planetary combination:\n#* If the combination involves Jupiter, then compare the angle of the price to Jupiter;\n#* Else, compare to the outer planet of the two.\n#* In the case of Venus-Saturn, since Jupiter is not involved, the price is compared against Saturn.\n# If the price makes an important aspect to Jupiter or the outer planet, then a turning point may have been reached.\n#* The important aspects in the Spiral Chart are the multiples of 45\u00b0 and 120\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 315\u00b0.\n#* The important aspects in the Hexagon Chart are the multiples of 60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 300\u00b0\n# By repeated experimentation, the trader can determine with chart (Spiral or Hexagon) works better on which commodity, and so forth.\n\nHere are a few actual trading examples in Corn given by Gann in ''How to Make Profits Trading in Commodities: A Study of the Commodity Market''.<ref name=\":6\" /> As stated earlier, Gann thought that the price of corn was influenced by the aspects of Venus and Saturn, thus the angle of the price on the Hexagon Chart is compared against Saturn.

The first one is that, when a planet returns to its position during a recent eclipse, then trend is likely to change.<ref name=\":3\" /> The second way is that when a planet crosses an eclipse spot which happens during a market top or bottom, then the down or up move will accelerate.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Planetary averages ===\nGann maintained two formulas for calculating planetary averages.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> The first one is called the Mean of Five (MOF), which is arithmetic mean of the geocentric and heliocentric longitudes of the outer five planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The other is called the Cycle of Eight (COE), which include all eight planets in its calculation, using both geocentric and heliocentric longitudes (the Sun replaces the Earth in the geocentric calculation). He thinks that when these averaged values make an aspect to the price, it will create support or resistance.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Personal view on religion ==\nEven though Gann was thought to be \u201creligious\u201d,<ref name=\":1\" /> a careful analysis of his writings finds that he did not agree with the conventional Christian teachings. On page 99 to 100 of his novel ''[[The Tunnel Thru the Air; Or, Looking Back from 1940|The Tunnel Thru the Air]]'' (1927),<ref name=\":0\" /> Gann revealed some of his personal believes towards religion through a conversation between the protagonist, Robert Gordon, and his mother:\n\n\u201cShe talked to Robert of his future and told him she hoped he would be a preacher. Robert confided to her that he could never be an orthodox minister, for he could not preach and teach the things which the orthodox ministers were teaching. He did not believe in a personal devil or believe in Hell, but believed in a God of Love and Justice. He did not believe that God would inflict upon any of his children eternal punishment but thought that whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap and that we receive our reward here upon earth.\n\n\u201cHe told her that the Bible plainly said that the kingdom of heaven is within us and he believed it. If we kept our conscience clear and did unto others as we would like to have them do unto us, he believed we would find our heaven and our reward here upon earth. Said that times and conditions were changing rapidly; that the new inventions and discoveries caused men to think differently than in the old days; that the old religious ideas would pass away and give place to more liberal, advanced ideas. He hoped to live to see the day when men would not only be too proud to fight, but would be too full of love for their fellowman to settle disputes with the sword. This was God's plan and it would come to pass this way, and he believed that he could be a great power for peace and hoped to live to see a world of peace with all nations united under one kingdom and one God, the God of Love and Justice.\u201d\n\nTwenty-three years later, on page 21 of his book ''The Magic Word'' (1950),<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Magic Word|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|publisher=Lambert Gann|year=1950|isbn=|location=Pomeroy, WA|pages=}}</ref> he expressed similar ideas:\n\n\u201cThe Bible is simple when rightly understood. It teaches the Divine Law, its uses and abuses. Whether a law is divine or natural, it is made plain that if you disobey the law, you must pay the penalty and if you obey or follow the law, your reward is certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bible does not teach reward after death but promises reward or a reaping now while you are here on this earth. Jesus said, \u2018As ye sow, also shall ye reap.\u2019 He did not say \u2018after death\u2019 but here and now. Too many have preached that we should live a life of sacrifice here on earth and wait until after death to receive the reward. This is not what people want. They want something practical. They want to receive their reward here on earth. If they put forth the right effort, they want to know that they will receive the reward here on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll natural laws teach and prove that we do get our reward on this earth. Job obeyed the law and got twice as much as he had while he was still on earth. There is nothing in the Bible that says these laws will not work today and I shall prove by the Bible that they do.\u201d\n\n== Controversy ==\nThere has been a general disagreement whether Gann himself made profits by speculation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneystockstycoons.com/articles/w-d-gann-fraud-or-trading-genius-part-2/|title=W.D.

At halftime the Old Etonians lead 5-1, however Darwen recovers with a progressive adjustment (spreading out their formation and focusing on passing) to draw 5 all.

The mill has financial issues and townsfolk pitch in to help pay for the trip.
