In her later life, she abandoned design to pursue other interests, specifically [[Egyptology]], a subject on which she became a published scholar in the 1950s.\n\nRambova was born into a prominent family in Salt Lake City who were members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. She was raised in San Francisco and educated in England before beginning her career as a dancer, performing under Russian ballet choreographer [[Theodore Kosloff]] in New York City. She relocated to Los Angeles at age 19, where she became an established costume designer for Hollywood film productions. It was there she became acquainted with actor [[Rudolph Valentino]], with whom she had a two-year marriage from 1923 to 1925. Rambova's association with Valentino afforded her a widespread celebrity typically afforded to actors.<ref name=picturing>{{Cite web|url=http://www.screeningthepast.com/2015/08/picturing-natacha-rambova-design-and-celebrity-performance-in-the-1920s/|work=Screening the Past|title=Picturing Natacha Rambova: Design and Celebrity Performance in the 1920s|author=Cook, Pam|accessdate=November 9, 2017|date=August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819101602/http://www.screeningthepast.com/2015/08/picturing-natacha-rambova-design-and-celebrity-performance-in-the-1920s/|archivedate=August 19, 2016}}</ref> Although they shared many interests such as art, poetry and [[spiritualism]], his colleagues felt that she exercised too much control over his work and blamed her for several expensive career flops.\n\nAfter divorcing Valentino in 1925, Rambova operated her own clothing store in Manhattan before moving to Europe and marrying the aristocrat \u00c1lvaro de Urz\u00e1iz in 1932. It was during this time that she visited Egypt, and developed a fascination with the country that remained for the rest of her life. Rambova spent her later years studying Egyptology and earned two [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation|Mellon Grant]]s to travel there and study Egyptian symbols and belief systems. She served as the editor of the first three volumes of ''Egyptian Religious Texts and Representations'' (1954\u20137) by Alexandre Piankoff, also contributing a chapter on symbology in the third volume. She died in 1966 in California of a heart attack while working on a manuscript examining patterns within the texts in the [[Pyramid of Unas]].\n\nRambova has been noted by fashion and art historians for her unique costume designs that drew on and synthesized a variety of influences, as well as her dedication to historical accuracy in crafting them. Academics have also cited her interpretive contributions to the field of Egyptology as significant. In popular culture, Rambova has been depicted in several films and television series, figuring significantly in the Valentino biopics ''[[The Legend of Valentino]]'' (1975), in which she was portrayed by [[Yvette Mimieux]], and [[Ken Russell]]'s ''[[Valentino (1977 film)|Valentino]]'' (1977) by [[Michelle Phillips]]. She was also featured in a fictionalized narrative in the network series ''[[American Horror Story: Hotel]]'' (2015), portrayed by [[Alexandra Daddario]].\n\n==Early life==\nRambova was born Winifred Kimball Shaughnessy on January 19, 1897, in Salt Lake City, Utah.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4G4uCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA28&dq=winifred+kimball+shaughnessy+january+1897#v=onepage&q=winifred%2520kimball%2520shaughnessy%2520january%25201897&f=false |title=Creating the Illusion (Turner Classic Movies): A Fashionable History of Hollywood Costume Designers |last=Jorgensen |first=Jay |last2=Scoggins |first2=Donald L. |date=2015-10-06 |publisher=Running Press |isbn=9780762458073 |pages=28 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Her father, Michael Shaughnessy, was an Irish Catholic from New York City who fought for the Union during the [[American Civil War]] and then worked in the mining industry.

Nazimova requested some alterations, and was impressed when Rambova was able to make these changes immediately in her own hand. Nazimova offered Rambova a position on her production staff as an art director and costume designer, proposing a wage of up to [[US dollar|USD]]$5,000 per picture ({{Inflation|US|5000|1920|fmt=eq}}).{{sfn|Rambova|Pickford|2009|p=225}} Rambova immediately began working for Nazimova on the comedy film ''[[Billions (film)|Billions]]'' (1920), for which she supplied the costumes and served as art director.{{sfn|Morris|1991|p=265}} She also designed the costumes for two Cecil DeMille films in 1920: ''[[Why Change Your Wife?]]'' and ''[[Something to Think About]]''.{{sfn|Morris|1991|p=57}} The following year, she served as the art director on the DeMille production ''[[Forbidden Fruit (1921 film)|Forbidden Fruit]]'' (1921), in which she designed (with [[Mitchell Leisen]]) an elaborate costume for a Cinderella-inspired fantasy sequence.{{sfn|Morris|1991|p=57}}\n\nWhile working on her second project for Nazimova\u2014''Aphrodite'', which never was filmed{{sfn|Rambova|Pickford|2009|p=238}}\u2014Rambova revealed to Kosloff that she planned on leaving him.

Although Valentino was still married to American film actress [[Jean Acker]], he and Rambova moved in together within a year, having formed a relationship based more on friendship and shared interests than on emotional or professional rapport. They then had to pretend to separate until Valentino's divorce was finalized, and married on May 13, 1922 in Mexicali, Mexico, an event described by Rambova as \"wonderful ... even though it did cause many worries and heartaches later.\"{{sfn|Rambova|Pickford|2009|p=61}} However, the law required a year to pass before remarriage, and Valentino was jailed for [[bigamy]], having to be bailed out by friends.{{sfn|Rambova|Pickford|2009|p=62}} They legally remarried on March 14, 1923 in [[Crown Point, Indiana]].{{sfn|Morris|1991|p=133}}\n\nBoth Rambova and Valentino were [[spiritualism|spiritualists]], and they frequently visited psychics and took part in s\u00e9ances and [[automatic writing]].{{sfn|Rambova|Pickford|2009|p=74}} Valentino wrote a book of poetry ''Daydreams'' with many poems about Rambova.{{sfn|Leider|2003|pages=241\u20132}} When it came to domestic life, Valentino and Rambova turned out to hold very different views.

Scarlets, vermilions, strong blues, [and] blazoning purples.\"{{sfn|Vaughn|2008|p=27}} She was cited as influential by several designers with whom she worked, including [[Norman Norell]], Adrian, and Irene Sharaff.{{sfn|Vaughn|2006|p=36}} Rambova typically dressed in the style of her designs, and thus her personal style was also influential: She often wore her hair in coiled \"ballerina style\" braids,{{sfn|Lambert|1997|p=233}} sometimes covered in a headscarf or [[turban]], with dangling earrings and calf-length velvet or [[brocade]] skirts.{{sfn|Leider|2012|p=47}} Actress [[Myrna Loy]] once proclaimed Rambova the \"most beautiful woman she'd ever seen.\"{{sfn|Leider|2012|p=47}} In 2003, Rambova was posthumously inducted into the Costume Designers' Guild Hall of Fame.{{sfn|Vaughn|2006|p=36}}\n\n===Scholarly influence===\nRambova's scholarly work has been regarded as significant by contemporary academics in the fields of Egyptology and history: Archaeologist Barbara Lesko notes that her contribution to Piankoff's ''Mythological Papyri'' \"demonstrates her organizational skills and her commitment to searching out truths and does not reek of unfounded theories or other eccentricity.\"<ref name=lesko/> Rambova's research, specifically her metaphysical interpretations of texts, has been deemed useful by Egyptologists Rudolph Anthes, [[Edward F.

In her later life, she abandoned design to pursue other interests, specifically [[Egyptology]], a subject on which she became a published scholar in the 1950s.\n\nRambova was born into a prominent family in Salt Lake City who were members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. She was raised in San Francisco and educated in England before beginning her career as a dancer, performing under Russian ballet choreographer [[Theodore Kosloff]] in New York City. She relocated to Los Angeles at age 19, where she became an established costume designer for Hollywood film productions. It was there she became acquainted with actor [[Rudolph Valentino]], with whom she had a two-year marriage from 1923 to 1925. Rambova's association with Valentino afforded her a widespread celebrity typically afforded to actors.<ref name=picturing>{{Cite web|url=http://www.screeningthepast.com/2015/08/picturing-natacha-rambova-design-and-celebrity-performance-in-the-1920s/|work=Screening the Past|title=Picturing Natacha Rambova: Design and Celebrity Performance in the 1920s|author=Cook, Pam|accessdate=November 9, 2017|date=August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819101602/http://www.screeningthepast.com/2015/08/picturing-natacha-rambova-design-and-celebrity-performance-in-the-1920s/|archivedate=August 19, 2016}}</ref> Although they shared many interests such as art, poetry and [[spiritualism]], his colleagues felt that she exercised too much control over his work and blamed her for several expensive career flops.\n\nAfter divorcing Valentino in 1925, Rambova operated her own clothing store in Manhattan before moving to Europe and marrying the aristocrat \u00c1lvaro de Urz\u00e1iz in 1932. It was during this time that she visited Egypt, and developed a fascination with the country that remained for the rest of her life. Rambova spent her later years studying Egyptology and earned two [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation|Mellon Grant]]s to travel there and study Egyptian symbols and belief systems. She served as the editor of the first three volumes of ''Egyptian Religious Texts and Representations'' (1954\u20137) by Alexandre Piankoff, also contributing a chapter on symbology in the third volume. She died in 1966 in California of a heart attack while working on a manuscript examining patterns within the texts in the [[Pyramid of Unas]].\n\nRambova has been noted by fashion and art historians for her unique costume designs that drew on and synthesized a variety of influences, as well as her dedication to historical accuracy in crafting them. Academics have also cited her interpretive contributions to the field of Egyptology as significant. In popular culture, Rambova has been depicted in several films and television series, figuring significantly in the Valentino biopics ''[[The Legend of Valentino]]'' (1975), in which she was portrayed by [[Yvette Mimieux]], and [[Ken Russell]]'s ''[[Valentino (1977 film)|Valentino]]'' (1977) by [[Michelle Phillips]]. She was also featured in a fictionalized narrative in the network series ''[[American Horror Story: Hotel]]'' (2015), portrayed by [[Alexandra Daddario]].\n\n==Early life==\nRambova was born Winifred Kimball Shaughnessy on January 19, 1897, in Salt Lake City, Utah.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4G4uCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA28&dq=winifred+kimball+shaughnessy+january+1897#v=onepage&q=winifred%2520kimball%2520shaughnessy%2520january%25201897&f=false |title=Creating the Illusion (Turner Classic Movies): A Fashionable History of Hollywood Costume Designers |last=Jorgensen |first=Jay |last2=Scoggins |first2=Donald L. |date=2015-10-06 |publisher=Running Press |isbn=9780762458073 |pages=28 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Her father, Michael Shaughnessy, was an Irish Catholic from New York City who fought for the Union during the [[American Civil War]] and then worked in the mining industry.

Although Valentino was still married to American film actress [[Jean Acker]], he and Rambova moved in together within a year, having formed a relationship based more on friendship and shared interests than on emotional or professional rapport. They then had to pretend to separate until Valentino's divorce was finalized, and married on May 13, 1922 in Mexicali, Mexico, an event described by Rambova as \"wonderful ... even though it did cause many worries and heartaches later.\"{{sfn|Rambova|Pickford|2009|p=61}} However, the law required a year to pass before remarriage, and Valentino was jailed for [[bigamy]], having to be bailed out by friends.{{sfn|Rambova|Pickford|2009|p=62}} They legally remarried on March 14, 1923 in [[Crown Point, Indiana]].{{sfn|Morris|1991|p=133}}\n\nBoth Rambova and Valentino were [[spiritualism|spiritualists]], and they frequently visited psychics and took part in s\u00e9ances and [[automatic writing]].{{sfn|Rambova|Pickford|2009|p=74}} Valentino wrote a book of poetry ''Daydreams'' with many poems about Rambova.{{sfn|Leider|2003|pages=241\u20132}} When it came to domestic life, Valentino and Rambova turned out to hold very different views.

Scarlets, vermilions, strong blues, [and] blazoning purples.\"{{sfn|Vaughn|2008|p=27}} She was cited as influential by several designers with whom she worked, including [[Norman Norell]], Adrian, and Irene Sharaff.{{sfn|Vaughn|2006|p=36}} Rambova typically dressed in the style of her designs, and thus her personal style was also influential: She often wore her hair in coiled \"ballerina style\" braids,{{sfn|Lambert|1997|p=233}} sometimes covered in a headscarf or [[turban]], with dangling earrings and calf-length velvet or [[brocade]] skirts.{{sfn|Leider|2012|p=47}} Actress [[Myrna Loy]] once proclaimed Rambova the \"most beautiful woman she'd ever seen.\"{{sfn|Leider|2012|p=47}} In 2003, Rambova was posthumously inducted into the Costume Designers' Guild Hall of Fame.{{sfn|Vaughn|2006|p=36}}\n\n===Scholarly influence===\nRambova's scholarly work has been regarded as significant by contemporary academics in the fields of Egyptology and history: Archaeologist Barbara Lesko notes that her contribution to Piankoff's ''Mythological Papyri'' \"demonstrates her organizational skills and her commitment to searching out truths and does not reek of unfounded theories or other eccentricity.\"<ref name=lesko/> Rambova's research, specifically her metaphysical interpretations of texts, has been deemed useful by Egyptologists Rudolph Anthes, [[Edward F.

She moved from New York to Hollywood, where she made a number of highly successful films for Metro that earned her considerable money. In 1927, she became a naturalized citizen of the United States.\n[[File:A-Month-in-the-Country-1930-B.jpg|thumb|[[Elliot Cabot]] and Alla Nazimova in the [[Theatre Guild]] production of ''[[A Month in the Country (play)|A Month in the Country]]'' (1930)]]\nNazimova soon felt confident enough in her abilities to begin producing and writing films in which she also starred. In her film adaptations of works by such notable writers as [[Oscar Wilde]] and Ibsen, she developed her own filmmaking techniques, which were considered daring at the time. Her projects, including ''[[A Doll's House (1922 film)|A Doll's House]]'' (1922), based on Ibsen, and ''[[Salom\u00e9 (1923 film)|Salom\u00e9]]'' (1923), based on Wilde's play, were critical and commercial failures. By 1925, she could no longer afford to invest in more films and financial backers withdrew their support.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nLeft with few options, she gave up on the film industry, returning to perform on Broadway, notably starring as Natalya Petrovna in [[Rouben Mamoulian]]'s 1930 New York production of Turgenev's ''[[A Month in the Country (play)|A Month in the Country]]'' and an acclaimed performance as Mrs. Alving in Ibsen's ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'', which critic [[Pauline Kael]] described as the greatest performance she had ever seen on the American stage. In the early 1940s, she appeared in a few more films, playing [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]]'s mother in ''[[Escape (1940 film)|Escape]]'' (1940) and [[Tyrone Power]]'s mother in ''[[Blood and Sand (1941 film)|Blood and Sand]]'' (1941).

A little over two years later, on November 16, 1925, Charles Bryant, then 43, surprised the press, Nazimova's fans and Nazimova herself by marrying Marjorie Gilhooley, 23, in [[Connecticut]].

In her film adaptations of works by such notable writers as [[Oscar Wilde]] and Ibsen, she developed her own filmmaking techniques, which were considered daring at the time. Her projects, including ''[[A Doll's House (1922 film)|A Doll's House]]'' (1922), based on Ibsen, and ''[[Salom\u00e9 (1923 film)|Salom\u00e9]]'' (1923), based on Wilde's play, were critical and commercial failures. By 1925, she could no longer afford to invest in more films and financial backers withdrew their support.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nLeft with few options, she gave up on the film industry, returning to perform on Broadway, notably starring as Natalya Petrovna in [[Rouben Mamoulian]]'s 1930 New York production of Turgenev's ''[[A Month in the Country (play)|A Month in the Country]]'' and an acclaimed performance as Mrs. Alving in Ibsen's ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'', which critic [[Pauline Kael]] described as the greatest performance she had ever seen on the American stage.

Her divorce papers, which arrived in the United States that summer, stated that on May 11, 1923, the marriage of \"citizeness Leventon Alla Alexandrovna\" and Sergius Arkadyevitch Golovin, \"consummated between them in the City Church of Boruysk June 20, 1899\", had been officially dissolved. A little over two years later, on November 16, 1925, Charles Bryant, then 43, surprised the press, Nazimova's fans and Nazimova herself by marrying Marjorie Gilhooley, 23, in [[Connecticut]]. When the press uncovered the fact that Charles had listed his current marital status as \"single\" on his marriage license, the revelation that the marriage between Alla and Charles had been a sham from the beginning embroiled Nazimova in a scandal that damaged her career.<ref name=\"lambert\">{{Cite book|title=Nazimova: A Biography|first=Gavin|last=Lambert|year=1997|publisher=Alfred A.

Her career began in her early teens in Philadelphia and continued in New York, where she posed for a cadre of respected artists of the era, including [[James Carroll Beckwith]], [[Frederick S. Church]], and notably [[Charles Dana Gibson]], who idealized her as a \"[[Gibson Girl]]\". She had the distinction of being an early [[Model (person)|fashion and artists' model]] in an era when both [[fashion photography]] (as an advertising medium) and the [[pin-up]] (as an art genre) were just beginning their ascendancy.\n\nNesbit received further worldwide attention when her husband, the mentally unstable multimillionaire [[Harry Kendall Thaw]], shot and killed the prominent architect and New York socialite [[Stanford White]] in front of hundreds of witnesses at the rooftop theatre of [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]] on the evening of June 25, 1906, leading to what the press would call the \"[[Trial of the Century]]\". During the trial, Nesbit testified that five years earlier, when she was a stage performer at the age of 15 or 16, she had attracted the attention of White, who first gained her and her mother's trust, then sexually assaulted her while she was unconscious, and then had a subsequent romantic and sexual relationship with her that continued for some time.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 99, 105 |ps=: \"nearly three times her age, at forty-six\".}}<ref>{{Citation | title = Tragic Beauty: The Lost 1914 Memoirs of Evelyn Nesbit | last = Paul | first = Deborah | publisher = Lulu }}</ref><ref>{{Citation | url= http://www.latimes.com/style/la-bk-rayner11-2008may11-story.html#page=1 | title = 'American Eve' by Paula Uruburu | last = Rayner | first = Richard | work = LA Times | accessdate = June 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Beckwith James Carroll Portrait of Evelyn Nesbit.jpg|thumb|right|[[James Carroll Beckwith]], ''Portrait of Evelyn Nesbit'', c. 1901]]\n\nFlorence Evelyn Nesbit was born on December 25, 1884, or December 25, 1885, in [[Tarentum, Pennsylvania|Tarentum]], a small town near [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]].{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 11, 21\u201322, 378 |ps=: \"Most don't know that her given name was apparently Florence Mary.\"}} In her childhood, she was primarily known as Florence Evelyn. The year of her birth remains unconfirmed, as the local records were later destroyed in a fire, and Evelyn herself said she was unsure of it; some sources have put the year as 1884, some as 1885, and it could even have been something else.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 21\u201322, 378 |ps=. The book gives her birth date as December 25, 1884, explicitly, while also saying \"or perhaps 1885, depending on whose version one takes into account,\" and in the end notes, says \"As for her correct age, the IRS had to rely on the sworn testimony she gave during the murder trial that she was born during 1884 to decide the issue of her receiving Social Security. But Evelyn was never quite sure if that was the correct year and always believed, as she wrote in a number of letters, that she was born in 1885 (which I also believe, given the furor over her turning 18 in December 1903, referred to in various accounts of events).\" In some places in the book where Nesbit's age is stated (e.g., in the description of her experience in Europe in 1903), the age given is inconsistent with the 1884 birth date.}} In later years, Nesbit confirmed that her mother at times added several years to her age to circumvent child labor laws.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date =February 2013}}<ref>Mooney, Michael Macdonald, ''Evelyn Nesbit and Stanford White: Love and Death in the Gilded Age'', Morrow, 1976</ref>{{Rp | needed = yes | date =February 2013}}\n\nShe was the daughter of Winfield Scott Nesbit and his wife, Evelyn Florence (n\u00e9e McKenzie), and was of [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] ancestry. Two years later, a son named Howard was born to the family.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 22}} Her father was an attorney and her mother attended to the domestic duties of the household.\n\nNesbit had an especially close relationship with her father, striving to please him with her accomplishments. Her father recognized his daughter's intellectual interests and encouraged her curiosity and self-confidence. Cognizant of her love of reading, he chose books for her to read and set up a small library for her. It contained diverse material, including fairy tales, fantasies, and books regarded as of interest to boys only \u2013 the \"pluck and luck\" stories that were popular in that era. When Nesbit showed an interest in music and dance, he encouraged her to take lessons.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 24\u201326}}\n\nThe Nesbit family moved to Pittsburgh around 1893. Nesbit's father died suddenly at age 40 when she was 10 or 11 years old, leaving the family penniless. They lost their home and all their possessions were auctioned off to pay outstanding debts. Nesbit's mother was unable to find work to earn money using her dressmaking skills, and a protracted period of time followed where the family existed solely through the charity of friends and relatives. They lived a nomadic existence, sharing a single room in a series of boarding houses. To ease the financial burden, little Howard Nesbit was often sent to live with relatives or family friends for indeterminate periods of time.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 24\u201326}}\n\nNesbit's mother was given some money and rented a house to use as a boardinghouse for a source of income, and sometimes assigned to the young Evelyn (aged about 12) the duty of collecting the rent from boarders. In her 1915 memoir, Nesbit later recalled that \"Mamma was always worried about the rent&nbsp; ... it was too hard a thing for her to actually ask for every week, and it never went smoothly.\" Mrs. Nesbit lacked the temperament or savvy to run a boardinghouse, and the venture failed.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 31\u201332}}\n\nUnder continuous financial distress which showed no prospect of improvement, Mrs. Nesbit moved to Philadelphia in 1898. She had acted on the encouragement of a friend, who advised her that relocation to Philadelphia could open opportunities for her employment as a seamstress. Evelyn and her brother Howard were sent to an aunt, and then transferred to a family in Allegany whose acquaintance their mother had made some years earlier.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 34\u201335}}\n\nMrs. Nesbit obtained employment, not as a seamstress, but as a sales clerk, at the fabric counter of [[Wanamaker's]] department store. She sent for her children, and both 14-year-old Evelyn and 12-year-old Howard also became Wanamaker employees, working 12-hour days, six days a week. At this time, Nesbit's modeling career began, through a chance encounter with an artist who was struck by the teenager's beauty and evocative charm. The artist asked Nesbit to pose for a portrait, and after verifying that the artist was a woman, Mrs. Nesbit agreed to let her daughter pose.  Nesbit sat for five hours and earned one dollar (equivalent to approximately $27.50 in 2016).<ref>http://www.in2013dollars.com/1898-dollars-in-2016?amount=1</ref>\n\nThis led to introductions to other artists in the Philadelphia area, and she became a favorite model for a group of respected, reputable illustrators, portrait painters, and stained-glass artisans.  In later life, Nesbit explained: \"When I saw I could earn more money posing as an artist's model than I could at Wanamaker's, I gave my mother no peace until she permitted me to pose for a livelihood.\"{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 40\u201341}}\n\n== Modeling career ==\n[[File:Evelyn Nesbit.jpg|thumb|Photograph by [[Rudolf Eickemeyer, Jr.]], 1901]]\nIn June 1900, Mrs. Nesbit, leaving her children in the care of others, relocated to New York City, again hoping to find work as a seamstress or clothing designer. However, she had even less success in finding employment in the competitive environment of New York City than she had had in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 56}} Philadelphia artists, with the idea of boosting Evelyn's modeling career, had provided letters of introduction to New York artists, but Mrs. Nesbit made no use of these prospective contacts.  In November 1900, still without employment, she finally sent for her children. The three were reunited and shared a single back room in a building on 22nd Street in Manhattan.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 52\u201355}}  Financial necessity and Evelyn's insistence on resuming modeling finally prompted Mrs. Nesbit to make use of the Philadelphia recommendations by contacting [[James Carroll Beckwith]], whose primary patron was [[John Jacob Astor IV|John Jacob Astor]].  This association opened up a world of further modeling opportunities for Evelyn, as Beckwith was a respected painter and instructor of life classes at the [[Art Students League]].  An elderly, courtly man, Beckwith felt protective of the teenaged girl, whose self-directed determination to pursue a modeling career aroused his paternal concern. He provided her with letters of introduction to legitimate artists such as [[Frederick S. Church]], Herbert Morgan, and Carle J. Blenner.\n\nUnhappily, Mrs. Nesbit was thrust into the role of managing her daughter's career. Unsophisticated, indecisive, and plagued with bouts of inertia, Evelyn's mother was unable to provide either business acumen or guardianship for her daughter.  In a later interview with reporters, Mrs. Nesbit maintained: \"I never allowed Evelyn to pose in the altogether\" (in the nude).  Two artworks, one by Frederick Church, and another by Beckwith in 1901, contradict Mrs. Nesbit, as they display a skimpily clad or partially nude Evelyn.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 58\u201359}}\n\nNesbit became one of the most in-demand artists' models in New York. [[Otto Sarony]] and [[Rudolf Eickemeyer, Jr.|Rudolf Eickemeyer]] were among those who took striking photographs of her.\n\n[[File:Harvard Theatre Collection - Evelyn Nesbit TCS 2 (seq 33).jpg|thumb|right|Nesbit photographed by [[Otto Sarony]], 1902]]\nNesbit became a popular cover face on women's magazines of the period, including ''[[Vanity Fair (magazines)|Vanity Fair]]'', ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', ''[[The Delineator]]'', ''Women's Home Companion'', ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]'', and ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 73}}  Inside the advertising pages of these magazines and in newspapers, her role became the business of creating consumer demand for toothpaste, face creams, and a sundry array of other commercial goods.  Her likeness and form were ubiquitous, showcased on sheet music and souvenir items \u2013 beer trays, tobacco cards, pocket mirrors, postcards, and chromolithographs. She often posed in vignettes, dressed in various guises: a Japanese [[geisha]], country gal, woodland nymph, Grecian goddess or [[Romani people|Roma]] maiden. The photo postcards were known as ''mignon'' (sweet, lovely), their pictorials being of a suggestive sensuality in contrast to the graphic display of the female body depicted in the notorious \"[[French postcard]]s\" of the day. Nesbit arguably became the first [[pin-up girl]], posing for calendars for Prudential Life Insurance, Swift, Coca-Cola, and other corporations.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 75\u201376}}\n\n[[File:Evelyn-Nesbit-age-16,-1901.jpg|thumb|left|Nesbit in 1901 (approximately at age 16)]]\n[[File:Evelyn Nesbit playing card.jpg|thumb|right|Nesbit represents \"The Queen of Hearts\" on a playing card]]\n\n[[File:Eternal-question.gif|thumb|left|''Woman: the Eternal Question'' by Charles Dana Gibson, 1901]]\n[[Charles Dana Gibson]], one of the country's most renowned artists of the era, used Nesbit as the model for one of his best-known  \"[[Gibson Girl]]\" works. Titled \"Woman: The Eternal Question\" ({{circa}}1903), the portrait features her in profile, with her luxuriant hair forming the shape of a question mark.\n\nGlamour photography of women, use of which was then referred to as the \"live model\" in newspaper and magazine advertising, was still in its infancy, yet gaining in popularity, moving to supplant [[illustration]]. Nesbit obtained work modeling for an early pioneer in [[fashion photography]], Joel Feder. The assignments were less strenuous, posing sessions being shorter in duration, and the work was lucrative. While working for Feder, Nesbit earned $5 for a half-day shoot and $10 for a full day \u2013 around $300 per day in 2019 dollars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1901?amount=10|title=CPI Inflation Calculator|date=May 28, 2019|publisher=In 2013 Dollars|accessdate=May 28, 2019}}</ref> Eventually, the fees she earned from her prolific modeling career exceeded the combined income she, her brother, and mother had earned at Wanamaker's department store in Philadelphia. The high cost of living in New York City, however, still caused strain on their finances.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 73}}\n\n== Chorus girl and actress ==\nNesbit became disaffected and bored with the long hours spent in confined environments, maintaining the immobile poses required of a studio model. Her popularity modeling had attracted the interests of theatrical promoters, some legitimate and some disreputable, offering her acting opportunities.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 84}} Nesbit pressed her mother to let her enter the theatre world, and Mrs. Nesbit ultimately agreed to let her daughter attempt this new way to augment their finances. An interview was arranged for the aspiring performer with John C. Fisher, company manager of the wildly popular play ''[[Florodora]]'', then enjoying a long run at the [[Casino Theatre (Broadway)|Casino Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Mrs. Nesbit's initial objections were softened by the knowledge that some of the girls in the show had managed to marry millionaires. In July 1901, costumed as a \"Spanish maiden\", Nesbit became a member of the show's chorus line, whose enthusiastic public dubbed them the \"Florodora Girls\". Billed as \"Florence Evelyn\", the new chorus girl was called \"Flossie the Fuss\", by the cast, a nickname which displeased her, and induced her to change her theatrical name to Evelyn Nesbit.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 87\u201388}}\n\nAfter her stint as a \"Florodora Girl\" ended, Nesbit sought out other theatrical possibilities.  She won a part in a production which had just come to Broadway, ''The Wild Rose''. After an initial interview with Nesbit, the show's producer, George Lederer, sensed he had discovered a new sensation. He offered her a contract for a year and, more significantly, moved her out of the chorus line and into a position as a featured player \u2013 the role of the [[Romani people|Roma]] girl \"Vashti\". The publicity machine began to roll, possibly fueled by Stanford White's influence, and she was hyped up in the gossip columns and theatrical periodicals of the day. On May 4, 1902, ''The New York Herald'' showcased her in a two-page article, liberally enhanced by photographs, promoting her rise as a new theatrical light, and detailing her career trajectory from model to chorus line to key cast member. \"Her Winsome Face to be Seen Only from 8 to 11pm\", the newspaper title announced to the public. The press coverage invariably touted her physical charms and potent stage presence; her acting skills were rarely mentioned.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 153\u201355}}\n\n==Relationships==\n=== Stanford White ===\n[[File:Stanford White by George Cox ca. 1892.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Stanford White by [[George C. Cox|George Cox]], c. 1892]]\n[[File:McKim, Mead and White crop.jpg|thumb|left|275px| The principals of the [[McKim, Mead & White]] architecture firm: [[William Rutherford Mead]], [[Charles Follen McKim]], and Stanford White (left to right)]]\nAs a chorus girl on Broadway in 1901, Nesbit was introduced to the architect [[Stanford White]] by [[Edna Goodrich]],{{Sfn | Nesbit | 1934 | p = 3}} who along with Nesbit was a member of the company of ''Florodora''.  White, a womanizer known as \"Stanny\" by his close friends and relatives, was then 46 years old and Nesbit 15 or 16. He was also married and had a son, but his wife was not much of a presence in his social environment. A practiced voluptuary, White used intermediaries to disarm the girl. Nesbit was initially struck by White's imposing size, which she said \"was appalling\", and she also said that to her he seemed \"terribly old\".{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 99, 105 |ps=: \"nearly three times her age, at forty-six\".}}\n\n==== \"The Red Velvet Swing\" ====\nWhite maintained a multifloor apartment on West 24th Street situated above the toy store [[FAO Schwarz]]. The entrance to the apartment was a doorway located adjacent to the store's back delivery entrance. White invited Nesbit and Edna Goodrich to join him there for lunch. In her memoir ''Prodigal Days'', Nesbit described her introduction to White's apartment.{{Sfn | Nesbit | 1934 | p = 27}} She was immediately overwhelmed by the d\u00e9cor; the walls adorned with fine paintings, the ornate, carved furniture, and the heavy red velvet draperies, which were drawn against the afternoon light. The only illumination in the room was the glow of soft light emanating from concealed lighting in the room. The other guest in attendance was an older man whom White introduced as Reginald Ronalds. The luncheon table was laid with food, which to Nesbit was an exotic delight \u2013 gourmet dishes prepared by [[Delmonico's]] restaurant. She was allowed one glass of champagne. Afterwards, they all ascended two flights up into a room decorated in green where a large, red velvet swing was suspended from the ceiling by ropes entwined with ivy-like vines. Nesbit was amused by the swing and consented to sit in it as White, with increasing momentum, propelled her vigorously into the air.  A game ensued whereby Edna Goodrich held a Japanese paper parasol by a cord; the object was for Nesbit's foot to target the parasol, repeatedly swinging and aiming until the parasol was shredded.  Nothing improper took place that day other than an aesthetic delight in the day's festivities.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://www.pbs.org/ | title = Evelyn Remembers | accessdate = July 12, 2012}}.</ref>{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date =February 2013}}\n\nOutwardly a witty, kind, generous man, White was frequently described in the newspapers as \"masterful\", \"intense\", and \"burly yet boyish\". He was able to impress both Nesbit and her mother as an \"interesting companion\".<ref>Uruburu, Paula, ''American Eve'', Riverhead Books, 2008, pp. 114\u2013115</ref> White moved mother, son, and daughter into a suite at the Wellington Hotel, which he himself had opulently decorated. Nesbit's bedroom was white and rose red, the drawing room a deep green, a reference to the green-hued room at White's 24th Street apartment where the red velvet swing hung from the ceiling.<ref>Uruburu, Paula, \"American Eve\", Riverhead Books, 2008, p. 116</ref>\n\nMrs. Nesbit grew favorably disposed to Stanford White. His interest appeared genuinely paternal, arranging for her fatherless son, Howard, to attend the Chester Military Academy, near Philadelphia. Over time, White managed to convince Mrs. Nesbit that a brief trip to visit friends in Pittsburgh would be a beneficial respite. He overcame her anxieties concerning her daughter's welfare, left unchaperoned in New York, by pledging his assurance that he would watch over the young girl.<ref name = \"White care\">''Prodigal Days''; Evelyn Nesbit, Julian Messner Publishers, New York, 1934, p. 37.</ref>\n\n[[File:Eickemeyer nesbit.jpg|thumb|Nesbit wearing flower wreath headband.]]\n[[File:Evelyn Nesbit Thaw by Bain News Service.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Nesbit in a decorative setting]]\n\n==== \"Mirror Room\" ====\nSeveral nights after her mother left for Pittsburgh, Nesbit and White were together in his 24th Street apartment. The two dined and drank champagne. White then proceeded to give Nesbit a tour of rooms, with the finale an unveiling of the \"mirror room\". This 10-by-10-foot room, situated on the same floor where the red velvet swing was installed, had walls and ceiling entirely paneled in mirrors and was furnished with a green velvet sofa. More champagne was consumed and Nesbit changed into a yellow satin kimono. She claimed that this was the last memory she had before losing consciousness. She said she subsequently awoke lying naked in bed next to White, who was also naked, and she noticed blood. She had \"entered that room a virgin\", but did not come out as one.{{Sfn | Nesbit | 1934 | p = 41}}\n\nDespite what had occurred, Nesbit then became White's regular lover and close companion for a period of some months. At some point, as the intensity of their relationship faded, she also discovered that he had been dallying with other young women, and had been keeping track of them in a \"[[Address book#Little black book|little black book]]\".\n\n=== John Barrymore ===\n[[John Barrymore]], known as \"Jack\", had seen the show ''The Wild Rose'' at least a dozen times since its opening, so entranced had he become with Nesbit on the stage. The two met at a lavish party given by Stanford White, who had invited Barrymore, the brother of a friend, the stage actress, [[Ethel Barrymore]]. In 1902, a romance blossomed between Nesbit and the young Barrymore. It was a unique relationship for her in that the 21-year-old Barrymore was a contemporary, a man close to her own age. He was a witty and fun-loving companion, and Nesbit became smitten with him. After an evening out, the couple often returned to Barrymore's apartment, remaining there together well into the early-morning hours. Avoiding the family path of entering the acting world, Barrymore was casually pursuing a career as illustrator and cartoonist. Although he showed some promise in his chosen field, his salary was small and he was behaving irresponsibly with the family money, and Nesbit's mother and White considered him an unsuitable match for her 16\u201317-year-old daughter.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 165\u201367}} Both Mrs. Nesbit and White were greatly displeased when they found out about the relationship. White engineered a plan to separate the couple by arranging for Nesbit's enrollment in a [[boarding school]] in New Jersey administered by Mathilda DeMille, the mother of the film director [[Cecil B. DeMille]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.smithsonian.com/ | last = Park | first = Edwards | title = Pictures of A Tragedy | publisher = Smithsonian | accessdate = September 23, 2012}}.</ref> In the presence of both Mrs. Nesbit and White, Barrymore had asked Nesbit to become his wife, but she turned down his marriage proposal. Many decades later, Barrymore's nephew Samuel Colt (Ethel's son) made an uncredited appearance in ''[[The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing]]'', a 1955 movie about Nesbit.\n\n=== Harry Kendall Thaw ===\n[[File:Harry Kendall Thaw c.1905.jpg|thumb|[[Harry Kendall Thaw]], husband of Nesbit]]\n[[File:Evelyn Nesbitt circa 1903.jpg|thumb|right|Nesbit, c. 1903]]\nAside from her relationship with Barrymore, Nesbit was involved with other men who vied for her attention as her sexual relationship with White faded. Among those were the [[polo]] player [[Monte Waterbury|James Montgomery Waterbury]], also known as \"Monte\", and the young magazine publisher [[Robert J. Collier]]. Throughout these relationships, White still remained a potent presence in her life, maintaining his position as benefactor.\n\nThe association which would come to dominate Nesbit's life, however, came in the person of [[Harry Kendall Thaw]], the son of a Pittsburgh coal and railroad baron. With a history of pronounced mental instability dating back into his childhood, Thaw, heir to a $40 million fortune, led a reckless, self-indulgent life.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 189}} Thaw had been in the audience of ''The Wild Rose'', attending some forty performances for the better part of a year. Even before he met Nesbit, Thaw had a burning resentment for White, who he thought had blocked Thaw's acceptance in social circles and was a womanizer who preyed on very young women.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008}} Thaw may have even chosen Nesbit as the focus of his attention because of her relationship with White.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008}}\n\nThrough an intermediary, Thaw ultimately arranged a meeting with Nesbit, introducing himself as \"Mr. Munroe\". Thaw maintained this subterfuge, with the help of confederates, while showering her with gifts and money, before he felt the time was right to reveal his true identity. With characteristic eccentricity, the day came when he confronted Evelyn and announced: \"I am not Munroe ... I am Harry Kendall Thaw, of Pittsburgh!\"{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 182\u201388}} She did not react with such surprise as he had expected. She was rather indifferent about his revelation, as she was already used to being the focus of wealthy men's attentions, and the fact that he was wealthy had already been evident.\n\n==== Trip to Europe ====\nWhile at the boarding school, Nesbit underwent emergency surgery in early 1903. The nature of the surgery has been a subject of some controversy. The official diagnosis was [[acute appendicitis]]; however, some sources have speculated that she had been pregnant (perhaps by Barrymore) and had an [[abortion]]. Evelyn's grandson, Russell Thaw, has said: \"I think she went away to have an abortion.\" However, under oath at Thaw's murder trials, both Barrymore and she subsequently denied any pregnancy or abortion.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-dec-11-me-then11-story.html | last = Rasmussen | first = Cecilia | title = Girl in The Red Velvet Swing Longed to Flee Her Past | date = December 11, 2005 | accessdate = August 18, 2012 | work = Los Angeles Times | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20190929071122/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-dec-11-me-then11-story.html | archivedate = September 29, 2019 }}.</ref>\n\nEvelyn's medical situation elicited the solicitous side of Thaw. He ensured that she received the best medical care available, and then promoted the idea that she should go on a European trip, convincing Evelyn and her mother that such a pleasure excursion would hasten Evelyn's recovery from the surgery. Evelyn's mother accompanied them on the trip for reasons of propriety. However, the trip proved to be anything but recuperative. Thaw's hectic mode of travel escalated into a nonstop itinerary, seemingly calculated to weaken Evelyn's emotional resilience and compound her physical frailty, and also to unnerve and exhaust Mrs. Nesbit. As tensions mounted, mother and daughter began to quarrel, leading to Mrs. Nesbit's insistence on returning to America. Having effectively alienated her from her mother, Thaw then took Evelyn to [[Paris]], leaving Mrs. Nesbit in [[London]].{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 212\u201313}}\n\n=== The Confession ===\nIn Paris, Thaw pressed Evelyn to become his wife, but she refused. Aware of Thaw's obsession with female [[chastity]], she could not in good conscience accept his marriage proposal without revealing to him the truth of her relationship with White. What followed was a marathon session of inquisition, during which time Thaw managed to extract every detail of that night: how, when plied with champagne, Nesbit lay intoxicated, and unconscious, while White \"had his way with her\". Throughout the grueling ordeal, Evelyn was tearful and hysterical; Thaw by turns was agitated, weeping, and gratified by her responses. He further drove the wedge between mother and daughter, condemning Mrs. Nesbit as an unfit parent. Evelyn blamed the outcome of events on her own willful defiance of her mother's cautionary advice and defended her mother as na\u00efve and unwitting.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 216\u201318}}\n\n=== The Castle ===\nThaw and Evelyn continued their travel through Europe. Thaw, as guide, chose a bizarre agenda, a tour of sites devoted to the cult of virgin martyrdom. In [[Domr\u00e9my]], [[France]], the birthplace of [[Joan of Arc]], Thaw left a telling inscription in the visitor's book: \"she would not have been a virgin if Stanford White had been around.\"{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 221}}\n\nThaw took Evelyn to [[Katzenstein Castle]] in the [[Austria]]n state of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], with the foreboding [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] structure sitting near a high mountaintop. Thaw segregated the three servants in residence {{ndash}} butler, cook, and maid {{ndash}} in one end of the castle; Evelyn and he took quarters isolating them at the opposite end.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.law2.umkc.edu/thaw/evelynstory1.html | title = Evelyn's Story | date = October 27, 1903 | format = affidavit | type = Evelyn Nesbit vs. Harry K.

The affidavit was introduced at the close of the state's case in the Harry Thaw murder trial.</ref> This was where Evelyn, to her horror, was locked in her room by Thaw, whose persona took on a dimension she had never before seen. Manic and violent, he beat her with a whip and sexually assaulted her over a two-week period. After his reign of terror had been expended, he was apologetic, and incongruously, after what had just happened, was in an upbeat mood.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 225}}\n\nOn her return to New York from Europe, in the company of friends, Evelyn unburdened herself, disclosing the ordeal of her imprisonment in the Austrian castle. Only then did others come forward with dark disclosures about Thaw and his propensity toward myriad addictive behaviors. From several men, she was told that Thaw \"took [[morphine]]\" and that \"he was crazy.\"{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 229}}\n\n==== Marriage ====\nAlthough he was still a part of her life, over time, Evelyn came to realize that she had no future with White. She also knew her entanglement with White had compromised her reputation; if the extent of their involvement became common knowledge, no respectable man would make her his wife. She also harbored some resentment towards White, faulting him for never being candid with her about Thaw's excesses and derangement.\n\nAs a teenager, Evelyn had spent her formative years thrust into the adult society of artists and theatre people; her development had proceeded without the companionship of contemporaries of her own age. Her mother had remarried, and although she had been an inept guardian, their [[Family estrangement|estrangement]] was now a fact; the new Mrs. Charles Holman was now effectively out of her daughter's life. Evelyn also feared a renewal of the poverty and deprivation that  she and her family had suffered for many years. Her vulnerability and isolation became palpable.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 244}}\n\n[[File:Thaw Home Cresson LOC13982v (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|\"Lyndhurst\" (William and Mary C. Thaw mansion), Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (demolished, c. 1942)]]\nThaw had pursued Evelyn obsessively for nearly four years, continuously pressing her for marriage. He told her he would change his behavior and that once they were married, he would live the life of a \"[[Benedictine]] monk\". Thaw was contrite about what had occurred at the Austrian castle. His explosive anger and rage had been directed at White, whom he called \"The Beast\". He knew Nesbit had been White's victim. Thaw, with a perverted sense of justice, and a show of magnanimous charity, assured Nesbit he had forgiven her.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 251\u201352}}\n\nCraving financial stability in her life, and keeping Thaw's \"sweet, generous, and gentle side\"{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp=193\u201394}} to the forefront, Evelyn finally consented to become his wife. \"Mama Thaw\", Thaw's mother, agreed to the marriage, decreeing that her future daughter-in-law give up the theatre and modeling and that her past life be forever obliterated; it was never to be talked of or referred to.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 258}}\n\nEvelyn and Thaw were married on April 4, 1905.<ref>Marriage License Docket, No. 1196, Series F; Register of Wills; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; via FamilySearch.org.</ref> Thaw himself chose Evelyn's wedding dress. Eschewing the traditional white gown, he dressed her in a black traveling suit decorated with brown trim.  Newspapers announced that the new Mrs. Thaw was now the \"Mistress of Millions\".{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 255}}\n\nThe two took up residence in the Thaw family home, Lyndhurst, in Pittsburgh. Isolated with Mama Thaw, subject to her strict religious precepts and the puritanical like-minded social group which assembled in the Thaw home, Evelyn became the proverbial bird in a gilded cage. In later years, she took measure of life in the Thaw household, saying that the Thaws were anything but intellectuals and that their value system was shallow and self-serving: \"the plane of materialism which finds joy in the little things that do not matter \u2013 the {{em|appearance}} of ... [things]\".{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 256}}\n\nEnvisioning a life of travel and entertaining, the newly wed Mrs. Harry Kendall Thaw was rudely awakened to a reality markedly different. Thaw himself entered into his mother's sphere of influence, seemingly without protest, taking on the pose of pious son and husband. At this time, Thaw instituted a zealous campaign to expose White, corresponding with the reformer [[Anthony Comstock]], the crusader for moral probity and the expulsion of vice. Because of his activity, Thaw became convinced that he was being stalked by members of the notorious [[Monk Eastman Gang]], hired by White to kill him. Thaw started to carry a gun. Evelyn later corroborated his mindset: \"[Thaw] imagined his life was in danger because of the work he was doing in connection with the vigilance societies and the exposures he had made to those societies of the happenings in White's flat.\"{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 260\u201361}}\n\n== The killing of Stanford White ==\nStanford White himself was thought to be unaware of Harry Kendall Thaw's long-standing vendetta against him.  White considered Thaw a poseur of little consequence, categorized him as a clown, and most tellingly, called him the \"Pennsylvania pug,\u201d a reference to Thaw's baby-faced features.\n\nJune 25, 1906, was an inordinately hot day. Thaw and Nesbit were stopping in New York briefly before boarding a luxury liner bound for a European holiday. Nesbit had been tense and uneasy throughout the day, as Thaw spent the day in and out of their hotel suite ostensibly taking care of last-minute details for their voyage. Late that day, Thaw disclosed his plans for the evening. He had purchased tickets for a new show, ''[[Mam'zelle Champagne]]'', written by [[Edgar Allan Woolf]], premiering on the rooftop theatre of [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]]. Accompanying them would be two of Thaw's male friends. They first stopped at the [[Cafe Martin]], where they inadvertently saw Stanford White, before proceeding on to Madison Square Garden.  In spite of the suffocating heat, which did not abate as night fell, Thaw inappropriately wore a long black overcoat over his tuxedo, which he refused to take off throughout the entire evening.\n\nAt 11:00&nbsp;pm, as the stage show was coming to a close, Stanford White appeared, taking his place at the table that was customarily reserved for him. Thaw had been agitated all evening, and abruptly bounced back and forth from his own table throughout the performance. Spotting White's arrival, Thaw tentatively approached him several times, each time withdrawing in hesitation. During the finale, \"I Could Love A Million Girls\", Thaw produced a pistol, and standing some 2 feet from his target, fired three shots into Stanford White's head and back, killing him instantly. Parts of White's face and skull were torn away and the rest of his features were unrecognizable, blackened by gunpowder.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 282}}  Thaw remained standing over White's fallen and bleeding body, displaying the gun aloft in the air, addressing the crowd. Witness reports differ as to the exact pronouncements Thaw made, and while the specific wording varies, all share a similar theme:  \"I did it because he ruined my wife! He had it coming to him. He took advantage of the girl and then abandoned her! ... You'll never go out with that woman again.\"<ref name = \"shots fired\">{{Citation | title = Thaw Murders Stanford White | newspaper = The New York Times | date = June 26, 1906 | page = 1}}.</ref>  In his book ''The Murder of Stanford White'', Gerald Langford quoted Thaw as saying \"You ruined my life\", or \"You ruined my wife\", and  ''[[The New York Times]]'' account the following day stated, \"Another witness said the word was \"wife\" instead of \"life\", contradicting the report made by the arresting officer.<ref name=\"shots fired\"/>\n\nThe crowd initially suspected the shooting might be part of the show, as elaborate practical jokes were popular in high society at the time. Soon, however, it became apparent that Stanford White was dead. Thaw, still brandishing the gun high above his head, walked through the crowd and met Nesbit at the elevator. When she asked what he had done, Thaw said that he had \"probably saved [her] life\".\n\nAs Thaw was taken into police custody, Nesbit managed to extricate herself from the ensuing chaos on the Madison Square rooftop.  Not wanting to return to the hotel suite she shared with Thaw, she took refuge for several days in the apartment of a chorus girl with whom she had struck up a friendship.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 297}}  Years later, Nesbit described her traumatic condition: \"A complete numbness of mind and body took possession of me ... I moved like a person in a trance for hours afterward.\"{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 284}}\n\n=== Press frenzy ===\n[[File:Stanford White 33 crop.jpg|thumb|287px|Front page, ''[[New York American]]'', June 26, 1906]]\nAs early as the morning following the [[homicide]], news coverage became both chaotic and single-minded, and ground forward with unrelenting momentum. A person, a place, or event, no matter how peripheral to the killing of Stanford White, was seized on by reporters and hyped as newsworthy copy.<ref>{{Citation | type = an alleged statement to police by Nesbit's former friend, actress [[Edna McClure]] | title = Mrs Thaw Urged Her Husband On | newspaper = The Washington Post | date = July 9, 1906 | page = 1}}</ref> Facts were thin, but sensationalist reportage was plentiful, in the heyday of tabloid journalism.\n\nThe hard-boiled male reporters of the [[yellow press]] were bolstered by a contingent of female counterparts, christened \"Sob Sisters\",<ref>{{Citation | url=http://www.ijp.org/page/sobsistervideo.htm | title = Sob sister video | publisher = USC Annenberg, School for Communication and Journalism | date = August 21, 2012}}.{{dead link|date=December 2015}}</ref> also known as \"The Pity Patrol.\"{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 318}}  Initially, female spectators were allowed in to witness the proceedings. However, as the trial continued, the judge banned women from the courtroom \u2013 excepting Thaw family members and the female news reporters there on \"legitimate business\".{{Sfn | Lutes | 2007 | p = 74}}  The stock in trade of this female contingent was the human-interest piece, heavy on sentimental tropes and melodrama, crafted to pull on the emotions and punch them up to fever pitch.\n\nAs a composite group, the female journalists tended to tread \"very gently\" with the defendant, Harry Kendall Thaw. They crafted their reportage to present him as a heroic figure who had married Nesbit in spite of her past.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} An individual of inherent virtue, Thaw was the embodiment of the duty with which every male in society was charged: man as protector of woman. They obscured Thaw's mental instability, drug addiction, and abusive behavior, and downplayed the considerations granted him by male prerogative and the privilege which his wealth and class afforded him.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe picture they painted of Nesbit was less empathetic, more measured. [[Nixola Greeley-Smith]] wrote of Nesbit: \"I think that she was sold to one man [Stanford White] and later sold herself to another [Harry Kendall Thaw].\"  In an article titled \"The Vivisection of a Woman's Soul\", Greeley-Smith described Nesbit's unmaidenly revelations as she testified on the stand: \"Before her audience of many hundred men, young Mrs. Thaw was compelled to reveal in all its hideousness every detail of her association with Stanford White after his crime against her.\"{{Sfn | Lutes | 2007 | pp = 82, 91}}\n\nThe rampant interest in the White killing and its key players were used by both the defense and prosecution to feed malleable reporters any \"scoops\" that would give their respective sides an advantage in the public forum. News coverage mercilessly dissected all the key players in what was called the \"Garden Murder\". One florid account, written to tug the heartstrings, keynoted Nesbit's vulnerability: \"Her baby beauty proved her undoing. She toddled as innocently into the arms of Satan as an infant into the outstretched arms of parental love ....\"   Neither was her mother spared the scrutiny of rogue reporting: \"She [her mother] knew better. She also knew she was sacrificing her child's soul for money ....\"{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 318\u201319}}\n\nChurch groups lobbied to restrict the media coverage, asking the government to step in as censor. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] decried the newspapers' penchant for printing the \"full disgusting particulars\" of the trial proceedings. He conferred with the US Postmaster General on the viability of prohibiting the dissemination of such printed matter through the United States mail, and censorship was threatened but never carried out.{{Sfn | Lutes | 2007 | p = 76}}\n\nOnly one week after the killing, a film title ''Rooftop Murder'' was released for public viewing at the [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon theaters]], rushed into production by [[Thomas Edison]].{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 301}}\n\nStanford White, in death, was not spared the firestorm of printed invective, which not only excoriated him as a man, but also questioned his professional achievements as architect. ''The Evening Standard'' concluded he was \"more of an artist than architect\", his work spoke of his \"social dissolution\".  ''The Nation'' was also critical: \"He adorned many an American mansion with irrelevant plunder.\"{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 306\u20137}} [[Richard Harding Davis]], a war correspondent and reputedly the model for the \"Gibson Man\", was angered by the tabloid press, who, he was adamant, had distorted the facts. An editorial, which appeared in ''Vanity Fair'', lambasting White and shredding his reputation, prompted Davis to pen his own rebuttal. The article, which appeared on August 8, 1906, in ''[[Collier's]]'' attested that:<ref>Uruburu, pp.306-307</ref>\n\n<blockquote>He admired a beautiful woman as he admired every other beautiful thing God has given us; and his delight over one was as keen, as boyish, as grateful over any others.</blockquote>\n\n== \"Trial of the Century\" ==\n=== Defense strategy ===\nThaw's mother was adamant that her son not be stigmatized by clinical insanity. She pressed for the defense to follow a compromise strategy: one of temporary insanity, or what in that era was referred to as a \"brainstorm\". Acutely conscious that her own family had a history of hereditary insanity, and after years of protecting her son's hidden life, she feared his past would be dragged out into the open, ripe for public scrutiny. Protecting the Thaw family reputation had become nothing less than a lifetime crusade for Thaw's mother. She proceeded to hire a team of doctors, at a cost of some $500,000, to substantiate that her son's act of homicide constituted a single aberrant act. Evelyn Nesbit in later years described the determination with which Thaw's family worked to favorably spin his mental deficiency: \"the Thaws will put the biggest lunacy experts that money can buy on the stand .... Harry was a madman but they will prove it nicely\".{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 323}}\n\n=== Star witness ===\nAgain maneuvering her way through the gauntlet of reporters, the curious public, the sketch artists, and photographers enlisted to capture the effect the \"harrowing circumstances [had] on her beauty\",{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 289}} Nesbit returned to her hotel and the assembled Thaw family.\n\nThe Thaws may have promised Nesbit a comfortable financial future if she provided testimony at trial favorable to Thaw's case. It was a conditional agreement; if the outcome proved negative, she would receive nothing. The rumored amount of money the Thaws pledged for her cooperation ranged from $25,000 to $1,000,000.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 324}}  Nesbit was now well aware that any solicitude or kindness shown her by the Thaw enclave was predicated on her pivotal performance on the witness stand. She was to present a pitiful portrait of innocence betrayed by the lascivious Stanford White. Thaw was to be the white knight whose noble, courageous act had avenged his wife's ruin.\n\nNesbit's mother remained conspicuously absent throughout her daughter's entire ordeal. Mrs. Nesbit had been cooperating with the prosecution as Thaw's lawyers considered her culpable of prostituting her daughter to Stanford White.{{Sfn | Lutes | 2007 | p = 85}}  Her brother Howard, who had come to regard Stanford White as a father figure, blamed Evelyn for his death.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 312}}\n\n=== Two trials ===\nHarry Kendall Thaw was tried twice for the homicide of Stanford White. Nesbit testified at both trials; her examination on the witness stand was an emotionally tortuous ordeal. In open court, she was forced to expose her relationship with White, and to describe the intimate details of the night she was raped by Stanford White. Until then, the night of her sexual assault had been a secret she had guarded at the request of White.  Other than White, only she and Thaw knew what had happened.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 333, 339}}\n\nDue to the unusual amount of publicity the case had garnered, the jury members were ordered to be [[Jury sequestration|sequestered]] \u2013 the first time in the history of American jurisprudence that such a restriction was ordered.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 322}}  The trial proceedings began on January 23, 1907, and the jury went into deliberation on April 11. After 47 hours, the 12 jurors emerged [[Hung jury|deadlocked]]. Seven had voted guilty, and five deemed Henry Kendall Thaw not guilty. Thaw was outraged that the trial had not vindicated the killing, that the jurors had not recognized it as the act of one chivalrous man defending innocent womanhood.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 354}}  The second trial took place from January 1908, through February 1, 1908.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 358}}  At the second trial, Thaw pleaded [[temporary insanity]].\n\nThaw was found not guilty, on the ground of insanity at the time of the commission of his act. He was sentenced to [[involuntary commitment]] for life in the [[Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane]] in [[Beacon, New York]]. His wealth allowed him to arrange accommodations for his comfort and be granted privileges not given to the general Matteawan population. Immediately after his confinement, Thaw marshaled the forces of a legal team charged with the mission of having him declared sane; the effort took seven years.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 359}}  The prolonged legal procedures compelled his escape from Matteawan.  In 1913, he strolled out of the asylum where a prearranged car and driver waited to take him over the Canada\u2013US border into [[Sherbrooke]], [[Quebec]]. He was extradited to the US, but in 1915, was released from custody after being judged sane.\n\n== Child ==\n [[File:Evelyn Nesbit and son, 1913.jpg|thumb|Evelyn Nesbit and son, Russell William Thaw, 1913]]\nNesbit gave birth to a son, [[Russell William Thaw]], on October 25, 1910, in Berlin, Germany. She always maintained that her son was Thaw's biological child, conceived during a conjugal visit to Thaw while he was confined at Matteawan, although Thaw denied paternity throughout his life.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 360, 363}}\n\nIn 1911, Nesbit reconciled with her mother, who took on the role of caregiver for the child while Nesbit sought out opportunities to support herself and her son.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 362}} Russell Thaw appeared with his mother in at least six films; ''Threads of Destiny'' (1914), ''[[Redemption (1917 film)|Redemption]]'' (1917), ''[[Her Mistake]]'' (1918), ''[[The Woman Who Gave]]'' (1918), ''I Want to Forget'' (1918), and ''[[The Hidden Woman]]'' (1922).\n\nRussell Thaw became an accomplished pilot, placing third in the 1935 [[Bendix Trophy]] race from [[Los Angeles]] to [[Cleveland]], ahead of [[Amelia Earhart]] in fifth place. \n\n== Later years ==\nThroughout the prolonged court proceedings, Nesbit had received financial support from the Thaws. These payments, made to her through the family's attorneys, had been inconsistent and far from generous. After the close of the second trial, the Thaws virtually abandoned her, cutting off all funds. Her grandson, Russell Thaw, recounted a piece of family lore in a 2005 interview with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'': purportedly, she had received $25,000 from the Thaws after the culmination of the trials. To spite them, she then donated the money to political [[anarchist]] [[Emma Goldman]], who subsequently turned it over to investigative journalist and political activist [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]].<ref name=\"latimes\">{{cite news| url = http://articles.latimes.com/2005/dec/11/local/me-then11 | last = Rasmussen | first = Cecilia | title = Girl in Red Velvet Swing Longed to Flee Her Past | accessdate = August 18, 2012 | newspaper = The LA Times | date=December 11, 2005}}.</ref>\n[[File:Evelyn Nesbit &amp; Jack Clifford 01.jpg|thumb|left|Nesbit with her dance partner and second husband, Jack Clifford]]\n\nNesbit was left to her own resources to provide for herself.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 358\u201361}}  She found modest success working in [[vaudeville]] and on the silent screen.

Their marriage was not a success; Evelyn seemed unable to start a new life, as the public refused to let her relinquish her past. Audiences came to see \"the lethal beauty\" associated with the \"playboy killer\" who shot Stanford White. Clifford came to find his wife's notoriety an insurmountable issue, with his own identity subsumed by that of \"Mr. Evelyn Nesbit\".{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 368}} He left her in 1918, and she divorced him in 1933.\n\nIn the 1920s, Nesbit briefly became the proprietor of a tearoom located in the West 50s in Manhattan.<ref>{{cite web |first=David |last=Freeland |url=http://gotham.fromthesquare.org/gallaghers-and-evelyn-nesbit/ |date=September 4, 2010 |access-date= January 1, 2019 |website=Gotham Lost & Found (blog)|title=Gallagher's and Evelyn Nesbit}}</ref> During this period and well into the 1930s, she struggled with [[alcoholism]] and morphine addiction. During the 1930s, she worked on [[burlesque]] stages throughout the country, though not as a stripper.

I wouldn't have to bother with so many clothes.\"<ref name=\"latimes\" />\n\nThaw, who as late as 1926 was still keeping his ex-wife under surveillance by private detectives, went to [[Chicago]] where Nesbit was hospitalized. He learned that Nesbit, despondent after losing her job dancing at the Moulin Rouge Caf\u00e9, had swallowed a disinfectant in a suicide attempt. The reunion generated speculation on the status of their relationship. One newspaper reported on January 8, 1926: \"Thaw to Visit Chicago: Reconciliation Rumor\".  In an interview with the press, Thaw revealed he had for some time been giving Nesbit $10 a day through an attorney<ref>{{Citation | title = Afflictor | url = http://www.afflictor.com/ | type = old print articles | contribution = Harry K Thaw | accessdate = July 20, 2012}}.</ref> as a \"token of pleasant memories of the past when we were happy\". They were photographed together in June 1926, and Nesbit gave an interview to ''The New York Times'', stating that Thaw and she had reconciled, but nothing came of the renewed relationship.

Her career began in her early teens in Philadelphia and continued in New York, where she posed for a cadre of respected artists of the era, including [[James Carroll Beckwith]], [[Frederick S. Church]], and notably [[Charles Dana Gibson]], who idealized her as a \"[[Gibson Girl]]\". She had the distinction of being an early [[Model (person)|fashion and artists' model]] in an era when both [[fashion photography]] (as an advertising medium) and the [[pin-up]] (as an art genre) were just beginning their ascendancy.\n\nNesbit received further worldwide attention when her husband, the mentally unstable multimillionaire [[Harry Kendall Thaw]], shot and killed the prominent architect and New York socialite [[Stanford White]] in front of hundreds of witnesses at the rooftop theatre of [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]] on the evening of June 25, 1906, leading to what the press would call the \"[[Trial of the Century]]\". During the trial, Nesbit testified that five years earlier, when she was a stage performer at the age of 15 or 16, she had attracted the attention of White, who first gained her and her mother's trust, then sexually assaulted her while she was unconscious, and then had a subsequent romantic and sexual relationship with her that continued for some time.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 99, 105 |ps=: \"nearly three times her age, at forty-six\".}}<ref>{{Citation | title = Tragic Beauty: The Lost 1914 Memoirs of Evelyn Nesbit | last = Paul | first = Deborah | publisher = Lulu }}</ref><ref>{{Citation | url= http://www.latimes.com/style/la-bk-rayner11-2008may11-story.html#page=1 | title = 'American Eve' by Paula Uruburu | last = Rayner | first = Richard | work = LA Times | accessdate = June 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Beckwith James Carroll Portrait of Evelyn Nesbit.jpg|thumb|right|[[James Carroll Beckwith]], ''Portrait of Evelyn Nesbit'', c. 1901]]\n\nFlorence Evelyn Nesbit was born on December 25, 1884, or December 25, 1885, in [[Tarentum, Pennsylvania|Tarentum]], a small town near [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]].{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 11, 21\u201322, 378 |ps=: \"Most don't know that her given name was apparently Florence Mary.\"}} In her childhood, she was primarily known as Florence Evelyn. The year of her birth remains unconfirmed, as the local records were later destroyed in a fire, and Evelyn herself said she was unsure of it; some sources have put the year as 1884, some as 1885, and it could even have been something else.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 21\u201322, 378 |ps=. The book gives her birth date as December 25, 1884, explicitly, while also saying \"or perhaps 1885, depending on whose version one takes into account,\" and in the end notes, says \"As for her correct age, the IRS had to rely on the sworn testimony she gave during the murder trial that she was born during 1884 to decide the issue of her receiving Social Security. But Evelyn was never quite sure if that was the correct year and always believed, as she wrote in a number of letters, that she was born in 1885 (which I also believe, given the furor over her turning 18 in December 1903, referred to in various accounts of events).\" In some places in the book where Nesbit's age is stated (e.g., in the description of her experience in Europe in 1903), the age given is inconsistent with the 1884 birth date.}} In later years, Nesbit confirmed that her mother at times added several years to her age to circumvent child labor laws.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date =February 2013}}<ref>Mooney, Michael Macdonald, ''Evelyn Nesbit and Stanford White: Love and Death in the Gilded Age'', Morrow, 1976</ref>{{Rp | needed = yes | date =February 2013}}\n\nShe was the daughter of Winfield Scott Nesbit and his wife, Evelyn Florence (n\u00e9e McKenzie), and was of [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] ancestry. Two years later, a son named Howard was born to the family.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 22}} Her father was an attorney and her mother attended to the domestic duties of the household.\n\nNesbit had an especially close relationship with her father, striving to please him with her accomplishments. Her father recognized his daughter's intellectual interests and encouraged her curiosity and self-confidence. Cognizant of her love of reading, he chose books for her to read and set up a small library for her. It contained diverse material, including fairy tales, fantasies, and books regarded as of interest to boys only \u2013 the \"pluck and luck\" stories that were popular in that era. When Nesbit showed an interest in music and dance, he encouraged her to take lessons.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 24\u201326}}\n\nThe Nesbit family moved to Pittsburgh around 1893. Nesbit's father died suddenly at age 40 when she was 10 or 11 years old, leaving the family penniless. They lost their home and all their possessions were auctioned off to pay outstanding debts. Nesbit's mother was unable to find work to earn money using her dressmaking skills, and a protracted period of time followed where the family existed solely through the charity of friends and relatives. They lived a nomadic existence, sharing a single room in a series of boarding houses. To ease the financial burden, little Howard Nesbit was often sent to live with relatives or family friends for indeterminate periods of time.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 24\u201326}}\n\nNesbit's mother was given some money and rented a house to use as a boardinghouse for a source of income, and sometimes assigned to the young Evelyn (aged about 12) the duty of collecting the rent from boarders. In her 1915 memoir, Nesbit later recalled that \"Mamma was always worried about the rent&nbsp; ... it was too hard a thing for her to actually ask for every week, and it never went smoothly.\" Mrs. Nesbit lacked the temperament or savvy to run a boardinghouse, and the venture failed.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 31\u201332}}\n\nUnder continuous financial distress which showed no prospect of improvement, Mrs. Nesbit moved to Philadelphia in 1898. She had acted on the encouragement of a friend, who advised her that relocation to Philadelphia could open opportunities for her employment as a seamstress. Evelyn and her brother Howard were sent to an aunt, and then transferred to a family in Allegany whose acquaintance their mother had made some years earlier.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 34\u201335}}\n\nMrs. Nesbit obtained employment, not as a seamstress, but as a sales clerk, at the fabric counter of [[Wanamaker's]] department store. She sent for her children, and both 14-year-old Evelyn and 12-year-old Howard also became Wanamaker employees, working 12-hour days, six days a week. At this time, Nesbit's modeling career began, through a chance encounter with an artist who was struck by the teenager's beauty and evocative charm. The artist asked Nesbit to pose for a portrait, and after verifying that the artist was a woman, Mrs. Nesbit agreed to let her daughter pose.  Nesbit sat for five hours and earned one dollar (equivalent to approximately $27.50 in 2016).<ref>http://www.in2013dollars.com/1898-dollars-in-2016?amount=1</ref>\n\nThis led to introductions to other artists in the Philadelphia area, and she became a favorite model for a group of respected, reputable illustrators, portrait painters, and stained-glass artisans.  In later life, Nesbit explained: \"When I saw I could earn more money posing as an artist's model than I could at Wanamaker's, I gave my mother no peace until she permitted me to pose for a livelihood.\"{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 40\u201341}}\n\n== Modeling career ==\n[[File:Evelyn Nesbit.jpg|thumb|Photograph by [[Rudolf Eickemeyer, Jr.]], 1901]]\nIn June 1900, Mrs. Nesbit, leaving her children in the care of others, relocated to New York City, again hoping to find work as a seamstress or clothing designer. However, she had even less success in finding employment in the competitive environment of New York City than she had had in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 56}} Philadelphia artists, with the idea of boosting Evelyn's modeling career, had provided letters of introduction to New York artists, but Mrs. Nesbit made no use of these prospective contacts.  In November 1900, still without employment, she finally sent for her children. The three were reunited and shared a single back room in a building on 22nd Street in Manhattan.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 52\u201355}}  Financial necessity and Evelyn's insistence on resuming modeling finally prompted Mrs. Nesbit to make use of the Philadelphia recommendations by contacting [[James Carroll Beckwith]], whose primary patron was [[John Jacob Astor IV|John Jacob Astor]].  This association opened up a world of further modeling opportunities for Evelyn, as Beckwith was a respected painter and instructor of life classes at the [[Art Students League]].  An elderly, courtly man, Beckwith felt protective of the teenaged girl, whose self-directed determination to pursue a modeling career aroused his paternal concern. He provided her with letters of introduction to legitimate artists such as [[Frederick S. Church]], Herbert Morgan, and Carle J. Blenner.\n\nUnhappily, Mrs. Nesbit was thrust into the role of managing her daughter's career. Unsophisticated, indecisive, and plagued with bouts of inertia, Evelyn's mother was unable to provide either business acumen or guardianship for her daughter.  In a later interview with reporters, Mrs. Nesbit maintained: \"I never allowed Evelyn to pose in the altogether\" (in the nude).  Two artworks, one by Frederick Church, and another by Beckwith in 1901, contradict Mrs. Nesbit, as they display a skimpily clad or partially nude Evelyn.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 58\u201359}}\n\nNesbit became one of the most in-demand artists' models in New York. [[Otto Sarony]] and [[Rudolf Eickemeyer, Jr.|Rudolf Eickemeyer]] were among those who took striking photographs of her.\n\n[[File:Harvard Theatre Collection - Evelyn Nesbit TCS 2 (seq 33).jpg|thumb|right|Nesbit photographed by [[Otto Sarony]], 1902]]\nNesbit became a popular cover face on women's magazines of the period, including ''[[Vanity Fair (magazines)|Vanity Fair]]'', ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', ''[[The Delineator]]'', ''Women's Home Companion'', ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]'', and ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 73}}  Inside the advertising pages of these magazines and in newspapers, her role became the business of creating consumer demand for toothpaste, face creams, and a sundry array of other commercial goods.  Her likeness and form were ubiquitous, showcased on sheet music and souvenir items \u2013 beer trays, tobacco cards, pocket mirrors, postcards, and chromolithographs. She often posed in vignettes, dressed in various guises: a Japanese [[geisha]], country gal, woodland nymph, Grecian goddess or [[Romani people|Roma]] maiden. The photo postcards were known as ''mignon'' (sweet, lovely), their pictorials being of a suggestive sensuality in contrast to the graphic display of the female body depicted in the notorious \"[[French postcard]]s\" of the day. Nesbit arguably became the first [[pin-up girl]], posing for calendars for Prudential Life Insurance, Swift, Coca-Cola, and other corporations.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 75\u201376}}\n\n[[File:Evelyn-Nesbit-age-16,-1901.jpg|thumb|left|Nesbit in 1901 (approximately at age 16)]]\n[[File:Evelyn Nesbit playing card.jpg|thumb|right|Nesbit represents \"The Queen of Hearts\" on a playing card]]\n\n[[File:Eternal-question.gif|thumb|left|''Woman: the Eternal Question'' by Charles Dana Gibson, 1901]]\n[[Charles Dana Gibson]], one of the country's most renowned artists of the era, used Nesbit as the model for one of his best-known  \"[[Gibson Girl]]\" works. Titled \"Woman: The Eternal Question\" ({{circa}}1903), the portrait features her in profile, with her luxuriant hair forming the shape of a question mark.\n\nGlamour photography of women, use of which was then referred to as the \"live model\" in newspaper and magazine advertising, was still in its infancy, yet gaining in popularity, moving to supplant [[illustration]]. Nesbit obtained work modeling for an early pioneer in [[fashion photography]], Joel Feder. The assignments were less strenuous, posing sessions being shorter in duration, and the work was lucrative. While working for Feder, Nesbit earned $5 for a half-day shoot and $10 for a full day \u2013 around $300 per day in 2019 dollars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1901?amount=10|title=CPI Inflation Calculator|date=May 28, 2019|publisher=In 2013 Dollars|accessdate=May 28, 2019}}</ref> Eventually, the fees she earned from her prolific modeling career exceeded the combined income she, her brother, and mother had earned at Wanamaker's department store in Philadelphia. The high cost of living in New York City, however, still caused strain on their finances.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 73}}\n\n== Chorus girl and actress ==\nNesbit became disaffected and bored with the long hours spent in confined environments, maintaining the immobile poses required of a studio model. Her popularity modeling had attracted the interests of theatrical promoters, some legitimate and some disreputable, offering her acting opportunities.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 84}} Nesbit pressed her mother to let her enter the theatre world, and Mrs. Nesbit ultimately agreed to let her daughter attempt this new way to augment their finances. An interview was arranged for the aspiring performer with John C. Fisher, company manager of the wildly popular play ''[[Florodora]]'', then enjoying a long run at the [[Casino Theatre (Broadway)|Casino Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Mrs. Nesbit's initial objections were softened by the knowledge that some of the girls in the show had managed to marry millionaires. In July 1901, costumed as a \"Spanish maiden\", Nesbit became a member of the show's chorus line, whose enthusiastic public dubbed them the \"Florodora Girls\". Billed as \"Florence Evelyn\", the new chorus girl was called \"Flossie the Fuss\", by the cast, a nickname which displeased her, and induced her to change her theatrical name to Evelyn Nesbit.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 87\u201388}}\n\nAfter her stint as a \"Florodora Girl\" ended, Nesbit sought out other theatrical possibilities.  She won a part in a production which had just come to Broadway, ''The Wild Rose''. After an initial interview with Nesbit, the show's producer, George Lederer, sensed he had discovered a new sensation. He offered her a contract for a year and, more significantly, moved her out of the chorus line and into a position as a featured player \u2013 the role of the [[Romani people|Roma]] girl \"Vashti\". The publicity machine began to roll, possibly fueled by Stanford White's influence, and she was hyped up in the gossip columns and theatrical periodicals of the day. On May 4, 1902, ''The New York Herald'' showcased her in a two-page article, liberally enhanced by photographs, promoting her rise as a new theatrical light, and detailing her career trajectory from model to chorus line to key cast member. \"Her Winsome Face to be Seen Only from 8 to 11pm\", the newspaper title announced to the public. The press coverage invariably touted her physical charms and potent stage presence; her acting skills were rarely mentioned.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 153\u201355}}\n\n==Relationships==\n=== Stanford White ===\n[[File:Stanford White by George Cox ca. 1892.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Stanford White by [[George C. Cox|George Cox]], c. 1892]]\n[[File:McKim, Mead and White crop.jpg|thumb|left|275px| The principals of the [[McKim, Mead & White]] architecture firm: [[William Rutherford Mead]], [[Charles Follen McKim]], and Stanford White (left to right)]]\nAs a chorus girl on Broadway in 1901, Nesbit was introduced to the architect [[Stanford White]] by [[Edna Goodrich]],{{Sfn | Nesbit | 1934 | p = 3}} who along with Nesbit was a member of the company of ''Florodora''.  White, a womanizer known as \"Stanny\" by his close friends and relatives, was then 46 years old and Nesbit 15 or 16. He was also married and had a son, but his wife was not much of a presence in his social environment. A practiced voluptuary, White used intermediaries to disarm the girl. Nesbit was initially struck by White's imposing size, which she said \"was appalling\", and she also said that to her he seemed \"terribly old\".{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 99, 105 |ps=: \"nearly three times her age, at forty-six\".}}\n\n==== \"The Red Velvet Swing\" ====\nWhite maintained a multifloor apartment on West 24th Street situated above the toy store [[FAO Schwarz]]. The entrance to the apartment was a doorway located adjacent to the store's back delivery entrance. White invited Nesbit and Edna Goodrich to join him there for lunch. In her memoir ''Prodigal Days'', Nesbit described her introduction to White's apartment.{{Sfn | Nesbit | 1934 | p = 27}} She was immediately overwhelmed by the d\u00e9cor; the walls adorned with fine paintings, the ornate, carved furniture, and the heavy red velvet draperies, which were drawn against the afternoon light. The only illumination in the room was the glow of soft light emanating from concealed lighting in the room. The other guest in attendance was an older man whom White introduced as Reginald Ronalds. The luncheon table was laid with food, which to Nesbit was an exotic delight \u2013 gourmet dishes prepared by [[Delmonico's]] restaurant. She was allowed one glass of champagne. Afterwards, they all ascended two flights up into a room decorated in green where a large, red velvet swing was suspended from the ceiling by ropes entwined with ivy-like vines. Nesbit was amused by the swing and consented to sit in it as White, with increasing momentum, propelled her vigorously into the air.  A game ensued whereby Edna Goodrich held a Japanese paper parasol by a cord; the object was for Nesbit's foot to target the parasol, repeatedly swinging and aiming until the parasol was shredded.  Nothing improper took place that day other than an aesthetic delight in the day's festivities.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://www.pbs.org/ | title = Evelyn Remembers | accessdate = July 12, 2012}}.</ref>{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date =February 2013}}\n\nOutwardly a witty, kind, generous man, White was frequently described in the newspapers as \"masterful\", \"intense\", and \"burly yet boyish\". He was able to impress both Nesbit and her mother as an \"interesting companion\".<ref>Uruburu, Paula, ''American Eve'', Riverhead Books, 2008, pp. 114\u2013115</ref> White moved mother, son, and daughter into a suite at the Wellington Hotel, which he himself had opulently decorated. Nesbit's bedroom was white and rose red, the drawing room a deep green, a reference to the green-hued room at White's 24th Street apartment where the red velvet swing hung from the ceiling.<ref>Uruburu, Paula, \"American Eve\", Riverhead Books, 2008, p. 116</ref>\n\nMrs. Nesbit grew favorably disposed to Stanford White. His interest appeared genuinely paternal, arranging for her fatherless son, Howard, to attend the Chester Military Academy, near Philadelphia. Over time, White managed to convince Mrs. Nesbit that a brief trip to visit friends in Pittsburgh would be a beneficial respite. He overcame her anxieties concerning her daughter's welfare, left unchaperoned in New York, by pledging his assurance that he would watch over the young girl.<ref name = \"White care\">''Prodigal Days''; Evelyn Nesbit, Julian Messner Publishers, New York, 1934, p. 37.</ref>\n\n[[File:Eickemeyer nesbit.jpg|thumb|Nesbit wearing flower wreath headband.]]\n[[File:Evelyn Nesbit Thaw by Bain News Service.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Nesbit in a decorative setting]]\n\n==== \"Mirror Room\" ====\nSeveral nights after her mother left for Pittsburgh, Nesbit and White were together in his 24th Street apartment. The two dined and drank champagne. White then proceeded to give Nesbit a tour of rooms, with the finale an unveiling of the \"mirror room\". This 10-by-10-foot room, situated on the same floor where the red velvet swing was installed, had walls and ceiling entirely paneled in mirrors and was furnished with a green velvet sofa. More champagne was consumed and Nesbit changed into a yellow satin kimono. She claimed that this was the last memory she had before losing consciousness. She said she subsequently awoke lying naked in bed next to White, who was also naked, and she noticed blood. She had \"entered that room a virgin\", but did not come out as one.{{Sfn | Nesbit | 1934 | p = 41}}\n\nDespite what had occurred, Nesbit then became White's regular lover and close companion for a period of some months. At some point, as the intensity of their relationship faded, she also discovered that he had been dallying with other young women, and had been keeping track of them in a \"[[Address book#Little black book|little black book]]\".\n\n=== John Barrymore ===\n[[John Barrymore]], known as \"Jack\", had seen the show ''The Wild Rose'' at least a dozen times since its opening, so entranced had he become with Nesbit on the stage. The two met at a lavish party given by Stanford White, who had invited Barrymore, the brother of a friend, the stage actress, [[Ethel Barrymore]]. In 1902, a romance blossomed between Nesbit and the young Barrymore. It was a unique relationship for her in that the 21-year-old Barrymore was a contemporary, a man close to her own age. He was a witty and fun-loving companion, and Nesbit became smitten with him. After an evening out, the couple often returned to Barrymore's apartment, remaining there together well into the early-morning hours. Avoiding the family path of entering the acting world, Barrymore was casually pursuing a career as illustrator and cartoonist. Although he showed some promise in his chosen field, his salary was small and he was behaving irresponsibly with the family money, and Nesbit's mother and White considered him an unsuitable match for her 16\u201317-year-old daughter.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 165\u201367}} Both Mrs. Nesbit and White were greatly displeased when they found out about the relationship. White engineered a plan to separate the couple by arranging for Nesbit's enrollment in a [[boarding school]] in New Jersey administered by Mathilda DeMille, the mother of the film director [[Cecil B. DeMille]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.smithsonian.com/ | last = Park | first = Edwards | title = Pictures of A Tragedy | publisher = Smithsonian | accessdate = September 23, 2012}}.</ref> In the presence of both Mrs. Nesbit and White, Barrymore had asked Nesbit to become his wife, but she turned down his marriage proposal. Many decades later, Barrymore's nephew Samuel Colt (Ethel's son) made an uncredited appearance in ''[[The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing]]'', a 1955 movie about Nesbit.\n\n=== Harry Kendall Thaw ===\n[[File:Harry Kendall Thaw c.1905.jpg|thumb|[[Harry Kendall Thaw]], husband of Nesbit]]\n[[File:Evelyn Nesbitt circa 1903.jpg|thumb|right|Nesbit, c. 1903]]\nAside from her relationship with Barrymore, Nesbit was involved with other men who vied for her attention as her sexual relationship with White faded. Among those were the [[polo]] player [[Monte Waterbury|James Montgomery Waterbury]], also known as \"Monte\", and the young magazine publisher [[Robert J. Collier]]. Throughout these relationships, White still remained a potent presence in her life, maintaining his position as benefactor.\n\nThe association which would come to dominate Nesbit's life, however, came in the person of [[Harry Kendall Thaw]], the son of a Pittsburgh coal and railroad baron. With a history of pronounced mental instability dating back into his childhood, Thaw, heir to a $40 million fortune, led a reckless, self-indulgent life.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 189}} Thaw had been in the audience of ''The Wild Rose'', attending some forty performances for the better part of a year. Even before he met Nesbit, Thaw had a burning resentment for White, who he thought had blocked Thaw's acceptance in social circles and was a womanizer who preyed on very young women.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008}} Thaw may have even chosen Nesbit as the focus of his attention because of her relationship with White.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008}}\n\nThrough an intermediary, Thaw ultimately arranged a meeting with Nesbit, introducing himself as \"Mr. Munroe\". Thaw maintained this subterfuge, with the help of confederates, while showering her with gifts and money, before he felt the time was right to reveal his true identity. With characteristic eccentricity, the day came when he confronted Evelyn and announced: \"I am not Munroe ... I am Harry Kendall Thaw, of Pittsburgh!\"{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 182\u201388}} She did not react with such surprise as he had expected. She was rather indifferent about his revelation, as she was already used to being the focus of wealthy men's attentions, and the fact that he was wealthy had already been evident.\n\n==== Trip to Europe ====\nWhile at the boarding school, Nesbit underwent emergency surgery in early 1903. The nature of the surgery has been a subject of some controversy. The official diagnosis was [[acute appendicitis]]; however, some sources have speculated that she had been pregnant (perhaps by Barrymore) and had an [[abortion]]. Evelyn's grandson, Russell Thaw, has said: \"I think she went away to have an abortion.\" However, under oath at Thaw's murder trials, both Barrymore and she subsequently denied any pregnancy or abortion.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-dec-11-me-then11-story.html | last = Rasmussen | first = Cecilia | title = Girl in The Red Velvet Swing Longed to Flee Her Past | date = December 11, 2005 | accessdate = August 18, 2012 | work = Los Angeles Times | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20190929071122/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-dec-11-me-then11-story.html | archivedate = September 29, 2019 }}.</ref>\n\nEvelyn's medical situation elicited the solicitous side of Thaw. He ensured that she received the best medical care available, and then promoted the idea that she should go on a European trip, convincing Evelyn and her mother that such a pleasure excursion would hasten Evelyn's recovery from the surgery. Evelyn's mother accompanied them on the trip for reasons of propriety. However, the trip proved to be anything but recuperative. Thaw's hectic mode of travel escalated into a nonstop itinerary, seemingly calculated to weaken Evelyn's emotional resilience and compound her physical frailty, and also to unnerve and exhaust Mrs. Nesbit. As tensions mounted, mother and daughter began to quarrel, leading to Mrs. Nesbit's insistence on returning to America. Having effectively alienated her from her mother, Thaw then took Evelyn to [[Paris]], leaving Mrs. Nesbit in [[London]].{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 212\u201313}}\n\n=== The Confession ===\nIn Paris, Thaw pressed Evelyn to become his wife, but she refused. Aware of Thaw's obsession with female [[chastity]], she could not in good conscience accept his marriage proposal without revealing to him the truth of her relationship with White. What followed was a marathon session of inquisition, during which time Thaw managed to extract every detail of that night: how, when plied with champagne, Nesbit lay intoxicated, and unconscious, while White \"had his way with her\". Throughout the grueling ordeal, Evelyn was tearful and hysterical; Thaw by turns was agitated, weeping, and gratified by her responses. He further drove the wedge between mother and daughter, condemning Mrs. Nesbit as an unfit parent. Evelyn blamed the outcome of events on her own willful defiance of her mother's cautionary advice and defended her mother as na\u00efve and unwitting.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 216\u201318}}\n\n=== The Castle ===\nThaw and Evelyn continued their travel through Europe. Thaw, as guide, chose a bizarre agenda, a tour of sites devoted to the cult of virgin martyrdom. In [[Domr\u00e9my]], [[France]], the birthplace of [[Joan of Arc]], Thaw left a telling inscription in the visitor's book: \"she would not have been a virgin if Stanford White had been around.\"{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 221}}\n\nThaw took Evelyn to [[Katzenstein Castle]] in the [[Austria]]n state of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], with the foreboding [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] structure sitting near a high mountaintop. Thaw segregated the three servants in residence {{ndash}} butler, cook, and maid {{ndash}} in one end of the castle; Evelyn and he took quarters isolating them at the opposite end.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.law2.umkc.edu/thaw/evelynstory1.html | title = Evelyn's Story | date = October 27, 1903 | format = affidavit | type = Evelyn Nesbit vs. Harry K.

The affidavit was introduced at the close of the state's case in the Harry Thaw murder trial.</ref> This was where Evelyn, to her horror, was locked in her room by Thaw, whose persona took on a dimension she had never before seen. Manic and violent, he beat her with a whip and sexually assaulted her over a two-week period. After his reign of terror had been expended, he was apologetic, and incongruously, after what had just happened, was in an upbeat mood.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 225}}\n\nOn her return to New York from Europe, in the company of friends, Evelyn unburdened herself, disclosing the ordeal of her imprisonment in the Austrian castle. Only then did others come forward with dark disclosures about Thaw and his propensity toward myriad addictive behaviors. From several men, she was told that Thaw \"took [[morphine]]\" and that \"he was crazy.\"{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 229}}\n\n==== Marriage ====\nAlthough he was still a part of her life, over time, Evelyn came to realize that she had no future with White. She also knew her entanglement with White had compromised her reputation; if the extent of their involvement became common knowledge, no respectable man would make her his wife. She also harbored some resentment towards White, faulting him for never being candid with her about Thaw's excesses and derangement.\n\nAs a teenager, Evelyn had spent her formative years thrust into the adult society of artists and theatre people; her development had proceeded without the companionship of contemporaries of her own age. Her mother had remarried, and although she had been an inept guardian, their [[Family estrangement|estrangement]] was now a fact; the new Mrs. Charles Holman was now effectively out of her daughter's life. Evelyn also feared a renewal of the poverty and deprivation that  she and her family had suffered for many years. Her vulnerability and isolation became palpable.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 244}}\n\n[[File:Thaw Home Cresson LOC13982v (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|\"Lyndhurst\" (William and Mary C. Thaw mansion), Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (demolished, c. 1942)]]\nThaw had pursued Evelyn obsessively for nearly four years, continuously pressing her for marriage. He told her he would change his behavior and that once they were married, he would live the life of a \"[[Benedictine]] monk\". Thaw was contrite about what had occurred at the Austrian castle. His explosive anger and rage had been directed at White, whom he called \"The Beast\". He knew Nesbit had been White's victim. Thaw, with a perverted sense of justice, and a show of magnanimous charity, assured Nesbit he had forgiven her.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 251\u201352}}\n\nCraving financial stability in her life, and keeping Thaw's \"sweet, generous, and gentle side\"{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp=193\u201394}} to the forefront, Evelyn finally consented to become his wife. \"Mama Thaw\", Thaw's mother, agreed to the marriage, decreeing that her future daughter-in-law give up the theatre and modeling and that her past life be forever obliterated; it was never to be talked of or referred to.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 258}}\n\nEvelyn and Thaw were married on April 4, 1905.<ref>Marriage License Docket, No. 1196, Series F; Register of Wills; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; via FamilySearch.org.</ref> Thaw himself chose Evelyn's wedding dress. Eschewing the traditional white gown, he dressed her in a black traveling suit decorated with brown trim.  Newspapers announced that the new Mrs. Thaw was now the \"Mistress of Millions\".{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 255}}\n\nThe two took up residence in the Thaw family home, Lyndhurst, in Pittsburgh. Isolated with Mama Thaw, subject to her strict religious precepts and the puritanical like-minded social group which assembled in the Thaw home, Evelyn became the proverbial bird in a gilded cage. In later years, she took measure of life in the Thaw household, saying that the Thaws were anything but intellectuals and that their value system was shallow and self-serving: \"the plane of materialism which finds joy in the little things that do not matter \u2013 the {{em|appearance}} of ... [things]\".{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 256}}\n\nEnvisioning a life of travel and entertaining, the newly wed Mrs. Harry Kendall Thaw was rudely awakened to a reality markedly different. Thaw himself entered into his mother's sphere of influence, seemingly without protest, taking on the pose of pious son and husband. At this time, Thaw instituted a zealous campaign to expose White, corresponding with the reformer [[Anthony Comstock]], the crusader for moral probity and the expulsion of vice. Because of his activity, Thaw became convinced that he was being stalked by members of the notorious [[Monk Eastman Gang]], hired by White to kill him. Thaw started to carry a gun. Evelyn later corroborated his mindset: \"[Thaw] imagined his life was in danger because of the work he was doing in connection with the vigilance societies and the exposures he had made to those societies of the happenings in White's flat.\"{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 260\u201361}}\n\n== The killing of Stanford White ==\nStanford White himself was thought to be unaware of Harry Kendall Thaw's long-standing vendetta against him.  White considered Thaw a poseur of little consequence, categorized him as a clown, and most tellingly, called him the \"Pennsylvania pug,\u201d a reference to Thaw's baby-faced features.\n\nJune 25, 1906, was an inordinately hot day. Thaw and Nesbit were stopping in New York briefly before boarding a luxury liner bound for a European holiday. Nesbit had been tense and uneasy throughout the day, as Thaw spent the day in and out of their hotel suite ostensibly taking care of last-minute details for their voyage. Late that day, Thaw disclosed his plans for the evening. He had purchased tickets for a new show, ''[[Mam'zelle Champagne]]'', written by [[Edgar Allan Woolf]], premiering on the rooftop theatre of [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]]. Accompanying them would be two of Thaw's male friends. They first stopped at the [[Cafe Martin]], where they inadvertently saw Stanford White, before proceeding on to Madison Square Garden.  In spite of the suffocating heat, which did not abate as night fell, Thaw inappropriately wore a long black overcoat over his tuxedo, which he refused to take off throughout the entire evening.\n\nAt 11:00&nbsp;pm, as the stage show was coming to a close, Stanford White appeared, taking his place at the table that was customarily reserved for him. Thaw had been agitated all evening, and abruptly bounced back and forth from his own table throughout the performance. Spotting White's arrival, Thaw tentatively approached him several times, each time withdrawing in hesitation. During the finale, \"I Could Love A Million Girls\", Thaw produced a pistol, and standing some 2 feet from his target, fired three shots into Stanford White's head and back, killing him instantly. Parts of White's face and skull were torn away and the rest of his features were unrecognizable, blackened by gunpowder.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 282}}  Thaw remained standing over White's fallen and bleeding body, displaying the gun aloft in the air, addressing the crowd. Witness reports differ as to the exact pronouncements Thaw made, and while the specific wording varies, all share a similar theme:  \"I did it because he ruined my wife! He had it coming to him. He took advantage of the girl and then abandoned her! ... You'll never go out with that woman again.\"<ref name = \"shots fired\">{{Citation | title = Thaw Murders Stanford White | newspaper = The New York Times | date = June 26, 1906 | page = 1}}.</ref>  In his book ''The Murder of Stanford White'', Gerald Langford quoted Thaw as saying \"You ruined my life\", or \"You ruined my wife\", and  ''[[The New York Times]]'' account the following day stated, \"Another witness said the word was \"wife\" instead of \"life\", contradicting the report made by the arresting officer.<ref name=\"shots fired\"/>\n\nThe crowd initially suspected the shooting might be part of the show, as elaborate practical jokes were popular in high society at the time. Soon, however, it became apparent that Stanford White was dead. Thaw, still brandishing the gun high above his head, walked through the crowd and met Nesbit at the elevator. When she asked what he had done, Thaw said that he had \"probably saved [her] life\".\n\nAs Thaw was taken into police custody, Nesbit managed to extricate herself from the ensuing chaos on the Madison Square rooftop.  Not wanting to return to the hotel suite she shared with Thaw, she took refuge for several days in the apartment of a chorus girl with whom she had struck up a friendship.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 297}}  Years later, Nesbit described her traumatic condition: \"A complete numbness of mind and body took possession of me ... I moved like a person in a trance for hours afterward.\"{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 284}}\n\n=== Press frenzy ===\n[[File:Stanford White 33 crop.jpg|thumb|287px|Front page, ''[[New York American]]'', June 26, 1906]]\nAs early as the morning following the [[homicide]], news coverage became both chaotic and single-minded, and ground forward with unrelenting momentum. A person, a place, or event, no matter how peripheral to the killing of Stanford White, was seized on by reporters and hyped as newsworthy copy.<ref>{{Citation | type = an alleged statement to police by Nesbit's former friend, actress [[Edna McClure]] | title = Mrs Thaw Urged Her Husband On | newspaper = The Washington Post | date = July 9, 1906 | page = 1}}</ref> Facts were thin, but sensationalist reportage was plentiful, in the heyday of tabloid journalism.\n\nThe hard-boiled male reporters of the [[yellow press]] were bolstered by a contingent of female counterparts, christened \"Sob Sisters\",<ref>{{Citation | url=http://www.ijp.org/page/sobsistervideo.htm | title = Sob sister video | publisher = USC Annenberg, School for Communication and Journalism | date = August 21, 2012}}.{{dead link|date=December 2015}}</ref> also known as \"The Pity Patrol.\"{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 318}}  Initially, female spectators were allowed in to witness the proceedings. However, as the trial continued, the judge banned women from the courtroom \u2013 excepting Thaw family members and the female news reporters there on \"legitimate business\".{{Sfn | Lutes | 2007 | p = 74}}  The stock in trade of this female contingent was the human-interest piece, heavy on sentimental tropes and melodrama, crafted to pull on the emotions and punch them up to fever pitch.\n\nAs a composite group, the female journalists tended to tread \"very gently\" with the defendant, Harry Kendall Thaw. They crafted their reportage to present him as a heroic figure who had married Nesbit in spite of her past.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} An individual of inherent virtue, Thaw was the embodiment of the duty with which every male in society was charged: man as protector of woman. They obscured Thaw's mental instability, drug addiction, and abusive behavior, and downplayed the considerations granted him by male prerogative and the privilege which his wealth and class afforded him.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe picture they painted of Nesbit was less empathetic, more measured. [[Nixola Greeley-Smith]] wrote of Nesbit: \"I think that she was sold to one man [Stanford White] and later sold herself to another [Harry Kendall Thaw].\"  In an article titled \"The Vivisection of a Woman's Soul\", Greeley-Smith described Nesbit's unmaidenly revelations as she testified on the stand: \"Before her audience of many hundred men, young Mrs. Thaw was compelled to reveal in all its hideousness every detail of her association with Stanford White after his crime against her.\"{{Sfn | Lutes | 2007 | pp = 82, 91}}\n\nThe rampant interest in the White killing and its key players were used by both the defense and prosecution to feed malleable reporters any \"scoops\" that would give their respective sides an advantage in the public forum. News coverage mercilessly dissected all the key players in what was called the \"Garden Murder\". One florid account, written to tug the heartstrings, keynoted Nesbit's vulnerability: \"Her baby beauty proved her undoing. She toddled as innocently into the arms of Satan as an infant into the outstretched arms of parental love ....\"   Neither was her mother spared the scrutiny of rogue reporting: \"She [her mother] knew better. She also knew she was sacrificing her child's soul for money ....\"{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 318\u201319}}\n\nChurch groups lobbied to restrict the media coverage, asking the government to step in as censor. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] decried the newspapers' penchant for printing the \"full disgusting particulars\" of the trial proceedings. He conferred with the US Postmaster General on the viability of prohibiting the dissemination of such printed matter through the United States mail, and censorship was threatened but never carried out.{{Sfn | Lutes | 2007 | p = 76}}\n\nOnly one week after the killing, a film title ''Rooftop Murder'' was released for public viewing at the [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon theaters]], rushed into production by [[Thomas Edison]].{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 301}}\n\nStanford White, in death, was not spared the firestorm of printed invective, which not only excoriated him as a man, but also questioned his professional achievements as architect. ''The Evening Standard'' concluded he was \"more of an artist than architect\", his work spoke of his \"social dissolution\".  ''The Nation'' was also critical: \"He adorned many an American mansion with irrelevant plunder.\"{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 306\u20137}} [[Richard Harding Davis]], a war correspondent and reputedly the model for the \"Gibson Man\", was angered by the tabloid press, who, he was adamant, had distorted the facts. An editorial, which appeared in ''Vanity Fair'', lambasting White and shredding his reputation, prompted Davis to pen his own rebuttal. The article, which appeared on August 8, 1906, in ''[[Collier's]]'' attested that:<ref>Uruburu, pp.306-307</ref>\n\n<blockquote>He admired a beautiful woman as he admired every other beautiful thing God has given us; and his delight over one was as keen, as boyish, as grateful over any others.</blockquote>\n\n== \"Trial of the Century\" ==\n=== Defense strategy ===\nThaw's mother was adamant that her son not be stigmatized by clinical insanity. She pressed for the defense to follow a compromise strategy: one of temporary insanity, or what in that era was referred to as a \"brainstorm\". Acutely conscious that her own family had a history of hereditary insanity, and after years of protecting her son's hidden life, she feared his past would be dragged out into the open, ripe for public scrutiny. Protecting the Thaw family reputation had become nothing less than a lifetime crusade for Thaw's mother. She proceeded to hire a team of doctors, at a cost of some $500,000, to substantiate that her son's act of homicide constituted a single aberrant act. Evelyn Nesbit in later years described the determination with which Thaw's family worked to favorably spin his mental deficiency: \"the Thaws will put the biggest lunacy experts that money can buy on the stand .... Harry was a madman but they will prove it nicely\".{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 323}}\n\n=== Star witness ===\nAgain maneuvering her way through the gauntlet of reporters, the curious public, the sketch artists, and photographers enlisted to capture the effect the \"harrowing circumstances [had] on her beauty\",{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 289}} Nesbit returned to her hotel and the assembled Thaw family.\n\nThe Thaws may have promised Nesbit a comfortable financial future if she provided testimony at trial favorable to Thaw's case. It was a conditional agreement; if the outcome proved negative, she would receive nothing. The rumored amount of money the Thaws pledged for her cooperation ranged from $25,000 to $1,000,000.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 324}}  Nesbit was now well aware that any solicitude or kindness shown her by the Thaw enclave was predicated on her pivotal performance on the witness stand. She was to present a pitiful portrait of innocence betrayed by the lascivious Stanford White. Thaw was to be the white knight whose noble, courageous act had avenged his wife's ruin.\n\nNesbit's mother remained conspicuously absent throughout her daughter's entire ordeal. Mrs. Nesbit had been cooperating with the prosecution as Thaw's lawyers considered her culpable of prostituting her daughter to Stanford White.{{Sfn | Lutes | 2007 | p = 85}}  Her brother Howard, who had come to regard Stanford White as a father figure, blamed Evelyn for his death.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 312}}\n\n=== Two trials ===\nHarry Kendall Thaw was tried twice for the homicide of Stanford White. Nesbit testified at both trials; her examination on the witness stand was an emotionally tortuous ordeal. In open court, she was forced to expose her relationship with White, and to describe the intimate details of the night she was raped by Stanford White. Until then, the night of her sexual assault had been a secret she had guarded at the request of White.  Other than White, only she and Thaw knew what had happened.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 333, 339}}\n\nDue to the unusual amount of publicity the case had garnered, the jury members were ordered to be [[Jury sequestration|sequestered]] \u2013 the first time in the history of American jurisprudence that such a restriction was ordered.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 322}}  The trial proceedings began on January 23, 1907, and the jury went into deliberation on April 11. After 47 hours, the 12 jurors emerged [[Hung jury|deadlocked]]. Seven had voted guilty, and five deemed Henry Kendall Thaw not guilty. Thaw was outraged that the trial had not vindicated the killing, that the jurors had not recognized it as the act of one chivalrous man defending innocent womanhood.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 354}}  The second trial took place from January 1908, through February 1, 1908.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 358}}  At the second trial, Thaw pleaded [[temporary insanity]].\n\nThaw was found not guilty, on the ground of insanity at the time of the commission of his act. He was sentenced to [[involuntary commitment]] for life in the [[Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane]] in [[Beacon, New York]]. His wealth allowed him to arrange accommodations for his comfort and be granted privileges not given to the general Matteawan population. Immediately after his confinement, Thaw marshaled the forces of a legal team charged with the mission of having him declared sane; the effort took seven years.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 359}}  The prolonged legal procedures compelled his escape from Matteawan.  In 1913, he strolled out of the asylum where a prearranged car and driver waited to take him over the Canada\u2013US border into [[Sherbrooke]], [[Quebec]]. He was extradited to the US, but in 1915, was released from custody after being judged sane.\n\n== Child ==\n [[File:Evelyn Nesbit and son, 1913.jpg|thumb|Evelyn Nesbit and son, Russell William Thaw, 1913]]\nNesbit gave birth to a son, [[Russell William Thaw]], on October 25, 1910, in Berlin, Germany. She always maintained that her son was Thaw's biological child, conceived during a conjugal visit to Thaw while he was confined at Matteawan, although Thaw denied paternity throughout his life.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 360, 363}}\n\nIn 1911, Nesbit reconciled with her mother, who took on the role of caregiver for the child while Nesbit sought out opportunities to support herself and her son.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | p = 362}} Russell Thaw appeared with his mother in at least six films; ''Threads of Destiny'' (1914), ''[[Redemption (1917 film)|Redemption]]'' (1917), ''[[Her Mistake]]'' (1918), ''[[The Woman Who Gave]]'' (1918), ''I Want to Forget'' (1918), and ''[[The Hidden Woman]]'' (1922).\n\nRussell Thaw became an accomplished pilot, placing third in the 1935 [[Bendix Trophy]] race from [[Los Angeles]] to [[Cleveland]], ahead of [[Amelia Earhart]] in fifth place. \n\n== Later years ==\nThroughout the prolonged court proceedings, Nesbit had received financial support from the Thaws. These payments, made to her through the family's attorneys, had been inconsistent and far from generous. After the close of the second trial, the Thaws virtually abandoned her, cutting off all funds. Her grandson, Russell Thaw, recounted a piece of family lore in a 2005 interview with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'': purportedly, she had received $25,000 from the Thaws after the culmination of the trials. To spite them, she then donated the money to political [[anarchist]] [[Emma Goldman]], who subsequently turned it over to investigative journalist and political activist [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]].<ref name=\"latimes\">{{cite news| url = http://articles.latimes.com/2005/dec/11/local/me-then11 | last = Rasmussen | first = Cecilia | title = Girl in Red Velvet Swing Longed to Flee Her Past | accessdate = August 18, 2012 | newspaper = The LA Times | date=December 11, 2005}}.</ref>\n[[File:Evelyn Nesbit &amp; Jack Clifford 01.jpg|thumb|left|Nesbit with her dance partner and second husband, Jack Clifford]]\n\nNesbit was left to her own resources to provide for herself.{{Sfn | Uruburu | 2008 | pp = 358\u201361}}  She found modest success working in [[vaudeville]] and on the silent screen.

The reunion generated speculation on the status of their relationship. One newspaper reported on January 8, 1926: \"Thaw to Visit Chicago: Reconciliation Rumor\".  In an interview with the press, Thaw revealed he had for some time been giving Nesbit $10 a day through an attorney<ref>{{Citation | title = Afflictor | url = http://www.afflictor.com/ | type = old print articles | contribution = Harry K Thaw | accessdate = July 20, 2012}}.</ref> as a \"token of pleasant memories of the past when we were happy\".
