The first known teacher of sign language was Dorcas Mitchell, who taught the children of one family in Charteris Bay, [[Lyttelton Harbour]], from 1868 to 1877. By 1877 she had taught 42 pupils.\n\nWhen the first school for the deaf (then called the Sumner [[Deaf-mute|Deaf and Dumb]] Institution) was opened at Sumner, south east of Christchurch in 1878, Mitchell applied unsuccessfully for the position of principal. Instead it went to Gerrit Van Asch, who agreed with the Milan congress of deaf educators of 1880 (to which no deaf people were invited) that teaching should be oral only, and that sign language should be forbidden. (He would not even admit pupils who could sign, so only 14 were admitted.) This was the policy of the school until 1979. A [[documentary film]] about the school made in the 1950s makes no mention of sign language. Similar policies were maintained at the schools at Titirangi and Kelston that opened in 1940 and 1958.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the children used sign language secretly and after leaving school, developing NZSL out of British Sign Language largely without adult intervention for over 100 years. The main haven for NZSL was the Deaf Clubs in the main centres. In 1979, \"Total Communication\" (a \"use anything that works\" philosophy) was adopted at the Sumner School, but the signing it used was \"Australasian Sign Language\" an artificial [[signed English|signed form of English]]. As a result, younger signers use a number of Australasian signs in their NZSL, to such an extent that some call traditional NZSL \"Old Sign\". NZSL was adopted for teaching in 1994.\n\nIn 1985, Marianne Ahlgren proved in her [[PhD]] [[thesis]] at [[Victoria University of Wellington]] that NZSL is a fully-fledged\nlanguage, with a large vocabulary of signs and a consistent grammar of space.\n\nThe New Zealand Sign Language Teachers Association (NZSLTA - formerly known as the New Zealand Sign Language Tutors Association) was set up in 1992. Over the next few years [[adult education]] classes in NZSL began in several centres. In 1997 a Certificate in Deaf Studies programme was started at Victoria University of Wellington, with instruction actually in NZSL, designed to teach deaf people how to competently teach NZSL to the wider public. Also in 1992 an interpreter training programme was established at the Auckland Institute of Technology, now known as [[Auckland University of Technology]]. This programme was first directed and taught by Dr Rachel Locker McKee (hearing) and Dr David McKee (deaf) and came about due to lobbying by the New Zealand Deaf Community and others who recognised the need for safer and more professional interpreting services.  They had as early as 1984 sought support for more research to determine the need for sign language interpreters.<ref>Dugdale, Patricia (2001). Talking Hands, Listening Eyes. Deaf Association of New Zealand</ref> Other than a one-off course run in 1985, this was the first time a professional training programme with a qualification was offered in New Zealand. Many of those who have gone on to work as professional NZSL interpreters began their journey in NZSL community classes taught by members of the NZSLTA.\n\nAn important step toward the recognition of NZSL was the publication in 1998 of a comprehensive NZSL [[dictionary]] by Victoria University of Wellington and the Deaf Association of NZ. It contains some 4000 signs (which correspond to many more meanings than the same number of English words, because of the way signs can be modulated in space and time), sorted by handshape, not English meaning, and coded in the Hamburg Notational System, [[HamNoSys]], as well as pictorially.  In 2011, Victoria University launched an Online Dictionary of New Zealand Sign Language<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nzsl.vuw.ac.nz/|title=The Online Dictionary of New Zealand Sign Language - NZSL Online|website=nzsl.vuw.ac.nz|accessdate=8 May 2017}}</ref> based on the original 1998 work, which includes video clips of each sign with examples and the ability to search for signs based on features of the sign (handshape, location, etc.) as well as the sign's English gloss.\n\nFor some years, [[TVNZ]] broadcast a weekly news programme, \"News Review\", interpreted in NZSL. This was discontinued in 1993 after a joint survey of deaf and [[Hearing impairment|hearing-impaired]] people found a majority favoured captioned programmes. Many Deaf people felt they had been misled by the survey. There has been no regular programming in NZSL since.\n\nBetween August 2012 to August 2013 the Human Rights Commission carried out an inquiry into the use and promotion of New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL). The inquiry has focused on working with key government agencies and the Deaf community around the inquiry's three terms of reference 1) The right to education for deaf people and potential users of NZSL. 2) The rights of deaf people, and other potential users of NZSL, to access communication, information and services, and the right to freedom of expression and opinion, through the provision of professional NZSL interpreter services and other NZSL services and resources. 3) The promotion and maintenance of NZSL as an official language of New Zealand. The full report of the inquiry, ''A New Era in the Right to Sign'', was launched in Parliament by the Minister for Disability Issues, Tariana Turia, on 3 September 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrc.co.nz/files/8014/2356/7275/A-New-Era-in-the-Right-to-Sign-for-web.pdf|title=A New Era in the Right to Sign|website=www.hrc.co.nz|accessdate=10 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Official language status==\nNZSL became the third [[Languages of New Zealand|official language of New Zealand]] on 11 April 2006, joining English and M\u0101ori.

Originally planned as a six-book series, ''The Wheel of Time'' spanned fourteen volumes, in addition to a prequel novel and two companion books. Jordan began writing the first volume, ''[[The Eye of the World]]'', in 1984, and it was published in January 1990.<ref name=\"peterahlstrom.blogspot.com\">{{cite web|author=Peter Ahlstrom |url=http://peterahlstrom.blogspot.com/2008/08/rolling-up-wheel-of-time-panel.html |title=Title Pending (\u4eee): Rolling up the Wheel of Time panel |website=Peterahlstrom.blogspot.com |date=2008-08-31 |accessdate=2017-03-07}}</ref>\n\nJordan [[Robert Jordan#Illness and death|died in 2007]] while working on what was planned to be the twelfth and final volume in the series. He prepared extensive notes so another author could complete the book according to his wishes. Fellow fantasy author and long-time ''Wheel of Time'' fan [[Brandon Sanderson]] was brought in to complete the final book, but during the writing process, it was decided that the book would be far too large to be published in one volume and would instead be published as three volumes:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyhPRIokTSM |title=Brandon Sanderson Interview |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-11-11 |accessdate=2017-03-07}}</ref> ''[[The Gathering Storm (novel)|The Gathering Storm]]'' (2009), ''[[Towers of Midnight]]'' (2010), and ''[[A Memory of Light]]'' (2013).\n\nThe series draws on numerous elements of both [[European mythology|European]] and [[Asian mythology]], most notably the cyclical nature of time found in [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]], the metaphysical concepts of [[Balance (metaphysics)|balance]] and [[Dualistic cosmology|duality]], and a respect for nature found in [[Taoism]]. Additionally, its creation story has similarities to [[Christianity]]'s \"Creator\" ([[Let there be light|Light]]) and Shai'tan, \"The Dark One\" ([[Shaitan]] is an Arabic word that, in [[Islam]]ic contexts, is used as a name for the [[Devil]] or the [[Satan]]). It was also partly inspired by [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]'' ([[1869 in literature|1869]]).<ref>{{cite news|title=Interview with Robert Jordan|work= SFX Magazine |number=16|date= September 1996}}</ref>\n\n''The Wheel of Time'' is notable for its length, detailed [[Fictional universe|imaginary world]], well-developed [[Magic (fantasy)|magic]] system, and large [[:Category:Wheel of Time characters|cast of characters]].

The series depicts fictional, ancient mythology that references [[Modern history|modern Earth history]], while events in the series prefigure real Earth myths. The series takes place about three thousand years after \"The Breaking of the World\", a global cataclysm that ended the \"Age of Legends\", a highly advanced era. Throughout most of the series, the world's technology and institutions are comparable to those of the [[Renaissance]], but with greater equality for women; some cultures are [[Matriarchy|matriarchal]]. Events later in the series prompt advances similar to the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\nThe main setting for the series is the western region or continent of a larger landmass, both unnamed; however, the western region has been called \"The Westlands\" in licensed media, and by author Robert Jordan in interviews. The Westlands contains multiple kingdoms and city-states and is bounded on the east by a mountain range. To the east is a desert, the Aiel Waste, inhabited by the Aiel warrior people, who live in small settlements and whose society is organized into [[clan]]s and warrior societies. Further east is the large and predominantly insular nation of Shara, separated from the Waste by large mountain ranges and other impassable terrain. North of all three regions is the Great Blight, a hostile wilderness inhabited by evil beings. The Westlands are mostly temperate; it and the Aiel Waste are in the world's northern [[Middle latitudes|mid-latitudes]]. Shara extends slightly south of the [[equator]]. Across an ocean west of the Westlands is Seanchan, the name of a landmass and the empire that spans it. Seanchan is narrower from east to west than the other landmass, but extends most of the way between the ice caps from south to north. A large island in the northwest is separated from the Seanchan mainland by a channel. At the beginning of the series, Westlanders are unaware of Seanchan's existence. ''[[The World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time]]'' depicts \"The Land of Madmen\", a small continent in the southern hemisphere, far to the south of the Westlands and the Aiel Waste; it is never mentioned in the main series.\n\nThe series takes place at the end of the \"Third Age\" time period; the Age of Legends was preceded by the \"First Age\", which is implied to be modern Earth. The Third Age in the Westlands was marked by two great upheavals. A thousand years after the Breaking, humanity was nearly overrun by creatures from the Blight in the \"Trolloc Wars\". A thousand years after that, High King Artur Hawkwing unified the region, but his death resulted in the \"War of the Hundred Years\" instead of an orderly dynastic succession. The division of the Westlands into nations changed completely after each of the two events. The Old Tongue, a fictional language from the series, is depicted as a now-dead language, spoken only by scholars and certain nobles, though it still plays a role in the plot of the books.\n\n\"The Pattern\" is a manifestation of both the physical world and people's destinies, while \"the Wheel\" represents the passage of time. These concepts apply to a series of [[Parallel universes in fiction|parallel worlds]], as well. Some characters observe or visit such other worlds; some of these worlds reflect different courses of history, and some are so divergent from the main reality that they are uninhabited. [[Physics]] sometimes operates differently in these worlds. The Seanchan imported \"exotic\" creatures from other worlds, later breeding and training them. Tel'aran'rhiod is the \"world of dreams\", which connects to all of the other worlds. It can be visited in one's sleep, but events there are real; it is also possible to enter physically.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe prequel novel ''[[New Spring]]'' takes place during the Aiel War and depicts the discovery by certain Aes Sedai that the Dragon has been Reborn.\n\nThe series proper commences almost twenty years later in the [[Andor (Wheel of Time)#Two Rivers|Two Rivers]], a near-forgotten district of the country of [[Andor (Wheel of Time)|Andor]]. An Aes Sedai, [[Moiraine Damodred|Moiraine]], and her Warder [[Lan Mandragoran|Lan]], arrive in the village of Emond's Field, secretly aware that servants of the Dark One are searching for a young man living in the area. Moiraine is unable to determine which of three youths ([[Rand al'Thor]], [[Matrim Cauthon]], or [[Perrin Aybara]]) is the Dragon Reborn, and leads all three of them from the Two Rivers, along with their friend [[Egwene al'Vere]]. [[Nynaeve al'Meara]], the village wise-woman, later joins them. [[Itinerant poet|Gleeman]] [[Thom Merrilin]] also travels with the group. The first novel depicts their flight from various agents of the Shadow and their attempts to reach the Aes Sedai city of [[Places in the Wheel of Time series#Tar Valon|Tar Valon]]. Thereafter the protagonists are frequently split into different groups and pursue different missions toward the cause of the Dragon Reborn, sometimes thousands of miles apart. As they struggle to unite the various kingdoms against the Dark One's forces, their task is complicated by rulers of the nations who refuse to lose their autonomy; by the zealots styling themselves 'the Children of the Light', who do not believe in the prophecies; and by the [[Seanchan]], the descendants of a long-lost colony of [[Artur Hawkwing]]'s empire. The Aes Sedai also become divided on how to deal with the Dragon Reborn.\n\nAs the story expands, new characters representing different factions are introduced.\n\n===Tarmon Gai'don===\nDeriving its name from that of [[Armageddon]] in Christian eschatology, Tarmon Gai'don is the apocalyptic battle wherein the Dragon Reborn opposes Shai'tan, while their followers fight elsewhere. Events and portents that foreshadow the Last Battle take place in ''[[Knife of Dreams]]'' and ''[[The Gathering Storm (novel)|The Gathering Storm]]''. The Last Battle takes place in ''[[A Memory of Light]]'', in the form of a 202-page single chapter.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/bryan-maygers/a-memory-of-light-wheel-of-time_b_2429397.html | title=''A Memory of Light'' Review: Brandon Sanderson and Robert Jordan Give a Thrilling End to The Wheel of Time | work=The Huffington Post | date=March 10, 2013 | accessdate=June 19, 2016 | author=Bryan Maygers}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of Wheel of Time characters}}\n\n==Special powers==\nIn the series, many characters possess special powers. Within the fictional world, some of these abilities are widely known and understood, while others are undocumented; some are depicted as unique. Some characters take the reappearance of ancient abilities as a sign that the Last Battle is coming.\n\n=== Channeling ===\n\"Channeling\" is equivalent to [[Magic in fiction|magic as depicted in other fantasy-genre works]], but is never called \"magic\" in the series. Many characters are channelers, including series protagonists Rand al'Thor, Egwene al'Vere, Nynaeve al'Meara, Elayne Trakand, Moiraine Damodred, and Aviendha. Channelers can access a natural power source called the \"One Power\", while Shai'tan can grant access to a separate power, the \"True Power\". Very little is written in the series about the True Power, while the One Power is described extensively. The One Power consists of five elemental \"Powers\": earth, water, air, fire, and spirit. Channelers often have particular strength in at least one Power, more commonly earth and fire in men and water and air in women; strength in spirit is equally rare between the sexes. A channeler creates a \"weave\" to achieve a specific effect by placing individual \"flows\" of the five Powers in a specific geometric configuration. The One Power has two aspects: \"saidin\", used by men; and \"saidar\", used by women. They differ sufficiently that no woman can teach a man to channel (and vice versa), and they can be used in drastically incompatible ways, though they sometimes achieve functionally identical effects. The True Power similarly differs from both. Male channelers are usually stronger than women, but women have advantages at \"linking\" with other channelers to harness more power; an individual's strength is quantified by the amount of the One Power he or she can channel at once. Some men and women are born with the \"spark\" to channel; these individuals will spontaneously begin to channel around puberty, but without formal training three of every four will suffer a fatal illness caused by channeling. Those who survive are called \"wilders\", and often are unaware of the existence or nature of their powers. Channelers are constrained by any restriction they believe applies; wilders often possess a \"block\" that allows them to channel only under specific circumstances (such as experiencing a particular emotion). The majority of channelers lack the spark and will channel only if taught. Channelers can determine if a person of the same sex has the spark or is capable of learning to channel. A channeler with the spark who receives instruction is not at risk of death and is not normally considered a wilder. Channelers have a longer lifespan than non-channelers, in proportion to their strength; from early adulthood, channelers age more slowly than non-channelers, and the strongest channelers can live over 800 years. Shai'tan tainted saidin at the end of the Age of Legends, causing any male channeler to go insane (usually very destructively) and die; the Breaking was caused by the world's male channelers simultaneously going insane, while in the Third Age male channelers are neutralized in various ways as they come of age.\n\nChannelers are treated in different ways by different cultures within the series. In the Westlands, channeling is viewed as synonymous with the Aes Sedai, an organization that survived from the Age of Legends and which views channeling as its proprietary domain; some Aes Sedai refer to channelers from other traditions as \"wilders\", even if they are not self-taught. Aes Sedai are respected in most Westland nations, and they rule the city-state of Tar Valon. Aes Sedai are divided into seven \"ajahs\" named after colors and dedicated to different purposes; Red Ajah members seek out men who can channel and \"gentle\" them (remove their ability to channel). Also in the Westlands are the Kin, consisting of women who studied in Tar Valon but left without becoming Aes Sedai due to lack of desire or ability to complete their training. The Aes Sedai are aware of the Kin, who are very discreet, but are unaware that the Kin actually outnumber them. Among the Sea Folk, a seafaring Westlands culture, female channelers are expected to become \"Windfinders\", ship's navigators; the profession is also open to non-channelers. Every generation, the Sea Folk send a few weak channelers to Tar Valon, successfully concealing the prevalence and strength of their channelers. Aiel channelers are expected to become Wise Ones, the culture's spiritual leaders, as are all Dreamwalkers; other worthy women may become Wise Ones without these special powers. Male Aiel channelers go into the Blight, expecting to die after killing some of Shai'tan's creatures; unbeknownst to the Aiel, Shai'tan actually captures and corrupts these men. Shara is secretly ruled by its female channelers, the Ayyad, through [[figurehead]] monarchs; the Ayyad keep their male offspring as breeding stock before killing them. The Seanchan believe channelers are subhuman and dangerous; they enslave female channelers with the spark, while those capable of acting as their handlers are, unbeknownst to themselves and other Seanchan, those who can learn to channel. Male channelers are executed.\n\nCertain \"objects of the One Power\" exist. \"Angreal\" and \"sa'angreal\" increase the amount of the One Power a channeler can harness; sa'angreal may be [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] more powerful than angreal. \"Ter'angreal\" produce specific effects; some require channeling to function, while others operate continuously or via touch; some affect only channelers or affect them differently.\n\n==== Talents ====\nRobert Jordan uses the capitalized word \"Talent\" to refer to two distinct types of abilities sometimes possessed by channelers; the text also sometimes uses \"Talent\" to refer to abilities unrelated to the One Power and possessed by non-channelers.\n\nOne type of Talent is the aptitude for a particular weave or type of weave. Talents seen in the series include healing (Nynaeve al'Meara), manipulating weather (many Windfinders), creating \"gateways\" for instantaneous travel (Androl Genhald), and fabricating the indestructible substance \"cuendillar\" (Egwene al'Vere). Such a Talent may manifest as finer control over weaves, the ability to use a weave that would otherwise be beyond the channeler's strength, superior results when using a weave with all other factors equal, or some combination of these benefits. Some weaves, such as creating cuendillar, function only for a channeler with a corresponding Talent.\n\nA Talent can also be some other ability possessed only by some channelers, but distinct from creating weaves of the One Power. Talents of this type include creating ter'angreal (Elayne Trakand), perceiving the purpose or function of a ter'angreal (Aviendha), analyzing an expended weave, \"unweaving\" a weave (Aviendha), predicting the weather (Nynaeve al'Meara), recognizing ta'veren on sight (Siuan Sanche and Logain Ablar), and \"Foretelling\" prophecy (Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan).  The latter three Talents have no obvious connection to the One Power, but are described as occurring only in channelers.\n\n=== Other abilities ===\nSome abilities depicted in the Wheel of Time are not related to the One Power or the ability to channel.\n\n\"Dreaming\" (an Aes Sedai term) is the ability to have prophetic dreams, which are usually symbolic rather than literal. \"Dreamwalking\" (an Aiel term) is a set of abilities involving dreaming, including the ability to visit Tel'aran'rhiod and the dreams of others at will, and aptitude for manipulating Tel'aran'rhiod.  Egwene al'Vere is both a Dreamer and Dreamwalker, and the text never establishes whether or not these are two separate things. Dreamwalking is well known to the Aiel Wise ones, who use it for society-wide communication; Aiel Dreamwalkers include channelers Amys and Melaine and the non-channeler Bair, who become Egwene's teachers as the last Aes Sedai Dreamer died about five hundred years earlier.  No man is explicitly identified as a Dreamwalker in the series, but many of the male and female Forsaken, Shai'tan's top lieutenants, appear in Tel'aran'rhiod, and the male Forsaken Ishamael projects himself into other characters' dreams.\n\n\"Ta'veren\" are individuals who are focal points of the Pattern for a time.  Rand al'Thor, Matrim Cauthon, and Perrin Aybara are all ta'veren during the events of the series. The Pattern causes events and the actions of others surrounding a ta'veren to conform to the ta'veren's [[destiny]], usually resulting in occurrences that are possible but unlikely.  Mat has exceptionally good luck at gambling and in battle, while Perrin easily earns the support of others.  Rand's presence often affects a large area around himself, causing such anomalies as one entire village pairing off in marriage in one day, another village erupting into violence over every disagreement its residents ever had, and a city's newborns being free of [[birth defect]]s during Rand's residency.\n\nRand al'Thor is also the \"Dragon Reborn,\" a prophesied savior.  Towards the end of the series, Rand is revealed to be a human tree singer a lost art. He is also shown to have reality warping abilities related to the Dragon Reborn's connection to the Pattern; he kindles a pipe without channeling.\n\nPerrin Aybara and Elyas Machera are \"Wolfbrothers,\" individuals who can communicate telepathically with wolves, which are depicted as [[Sapience|sapient]].  Wolfbrothers also have abilities similar to Dreaming and Dreamwalking, although they are not shown as capable of entering the dreams of others. The souls of wolves inhabit Tel'aran'rhiod, which they call the \"wolf dream,\" and a Wolfbrother who loses his identity as a man may become a wolf there.  Only male Wolfbrothers are depicted in the series.\n\nMin Farshaw sees [[Aura (paranormal)|auras]] and images around people; she does not always understand these visions, but sometimes she instinctively understands them and is always correct in such cases.  Min is the only person in the series depicted as having this ability.  However, the superstitious Seanchan are apparently familiar with it and consider the images to be [[omen]]s; when Empress Fortuona learns that Min possesses this ability, she identifies Min as a \"Doomseer\" and immediately makes her a top advisor.\n\nHurin is a \"sniffer,\" one who can detect violence as an unpleasant odor.  This ability is apparently accepted by his countrymen; it is considered an asset for his career in law enforcement, and Perrin pretends to be a sniffer to conceal that the true source of his insight is communication with wolves.\n\nThe Seanchan produce ter'angreal rings that, when touched with the wearer's blood, grant him or her the abilities of a \"Bloodknife\":  increased strength and speed and the ability to blend into shadows, at the cost of dying within a matter of days or weeks.\n\nThe books describe several scenarios where Shai'tan gives powers to individuals.  People whose souls are removed by Shai'tan become supernaturally inconspicuous \"Gray Men,\" ideal assassins.  Padan Fain serves Shai'tan and is given the ability to track Rand al'Thor. Padan Fain later merges with the ghost of the evil Mordeth, gaining the abilities to inculcate others with paranoia and to summon and control a deadly miasma.  Shai'tan merges the bodies and souls of Isam Mandragoran and Luc Mantear into the individual known as Slayer, to whom Shai'tan grants powers involving Tel'aran'rhiod, including the ability to travel instantaneously between there and the physical world while awake and without the use of a gateway.\n\n== Books in the series ==\n{{Episode table |background=#93B8C4 |overall= |title= |airdate=

Alan Romanczuk and Maria Simons were Robert Jordan's editorial assistants. The book is an encapsulating glossary of the entire series.\n\n==Development==\n===Writing and conception===\nIn the early 1980s Robert Jordan wrote several [[Conan the Barbarian]] novels for Tor Books, including a [[novelization]] of the movie ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]''. These proved successful and in 1984 he proposed an idea for an epic fantasy series of three books to Tom Doherty, the head of [[Tor Books]].<ref name=\"peterahlstrom.blogspot.com\"/> Doherty approved the idea; however, knowing that Jordan had a tendency to go long, Doherty put Jordan on contract for six books just in case.  Jordan began writing the novel that became ''The Eye of the World''.<ref name=\"peterahlstrom.blogspot.com\"/>\n\nThe novel proved extremely difficult to write and characters and storylines changed considerably during the writing process. The series was originally centered on an older man who discovered relatively late in life that he was the 'chosen one' who had to save the world. However, Jordan deliberately decided to move closer to the tone and style of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' and made the characters younger and less experienced.<ref name=\"thewertzone\">{{cite web|url=http://thewertzone.blogspot.ca/2018/01/the-genesis-of-wheel-of-time.html |title=The Genesis of the Wheel of Time |last=Whitehead |first=Adam |date=2018-01-07 |accessdate=2018-01-08}}</ref> Once this decision had been made, writing proceeded much more easily and Jordan completed the second volume, ''[[The Great Hunt]]'', at roughly the same time the first book was published.<ref>Foreword dated February 1990, ''The Great Hunt'' by Robert Jordan, published by Tor Books</ref>\n\nTom Doherty enjoyed ''The Eye of the World'' so much that he declared it would be the biggest fantasy series since Tolkien,{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}  and took the unprecedented steps of sending free review copies to every bookstore in the United States to generate interest.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} The combined hardcover and trade paperback run of the novel sold out of its initial 40,000-strong print run. Sales then doubled with the publication of the second novel just eight months later generating more interest in the first book.<ref name=\"peterahlstrom.blogspot.com\"/>\n\nJordan wrote full-time at breakneck speed for the next several years until he completed the seventh volume, ''[[A Crown of Swords]]'', at which point he slowed down, delivering a book every two years. Fans objected when he took some time off to expand a short story into a prequel novel called ''New Spring'', so he decided to shelve his plans for additional prequels in favor of finishing off the last two volumes in the series. He rejected criticisms of the later volumes of the series slowing down in pace in order to concentrate on minor secondary characters at the expense of the main characters from the opening volumes, but acknowledged that his structure for the tenth volume, ''[[Crossroads of Twilight]]'' (where he showed a major scene from the prior book, ''[[Winter's Heart]]'', from the perspective of the main characters that were not involved in the scene), had not worked out as he had planned.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} ''[[Knife of Dreams]]'', the eleventh volume, had a much more positive reception from critics and fans alike and Jordan announced the twelfth volume, which he had previously announced would have the working title ''A Memory of Light'', would conclude the series.\n\n===Author's death and final books===\n{{See also|A Memory of Light|The Gathering Storm (novel)|Towers of Midnight}}\nJordan had stated that the main sequence would conclude with the twelfth book, ''[[A Memory of Light]]''.

Notably, the ''WoTMUD'' had gained written permission from the author to use his creation including all but major characters.\n\nA [[The Wheel of Time (video game)|''Wheel of Time'' computer game]] was released in 1999. Over the course of the game, a lone Aes Sedai must track down a robber following an assault on the White Tower, and prevent the Dark One from being released prematurely. She eventually learns of and executes a long-forgotten ritual at Shayol Ghul to ensure the Dark Lord remains sealed within the prison. While Robert Jordan was consulted in the creation of the game, he did not write the storyline himself and the game is not considered [[Canon (fiction)|canon]].\n\n''[[The Wheel of Time Roleplaying Game]]'' was released in 2001 from [[Wizards of the Coast]] using the [[d20 system|d20]] rules developed for the third edition of the [[Dungeons and Dragons]] game. The game had a single adventure module published in 2002, ''Prophecies of the Dragon''. Shortly after the release of the adventure book Wizards of the Coast announced they would not be releasing any further products for the game. Robert Jordan cited some problems with the roleplaying game, such as storyline details in the adventure module that contradicted the books.\n\nIn early 2009 [[Electronic Arts|EA Games]] announced that they had bought the rights for a MMORPG, with the plan to publish it through the EA Partners-Program.

Originally planned as a six-book series, ''The Wheel of Time'' spanned fourteen volumes, in addition to a prequel novel and two companion books. Jordan began writing the first volume, ''[[The Eye of the World]]'', in 1984, and it was published in January 1990.<ref name=\"peterahlstrom.blogspot.com\">{{cite web|author=Peter Ahlstrom |url=http://peterahlstrom.blogspot.com/2008/08/rolling-up-wheel-of-time-panel.html |title=Title Pending (\u4eee): Rolling up the Wheel of Time panel |website=Peterahlstrom.blogspot.com |date=2008-08-31 |accessdate=2017-03-07}}</ref>\n\nJordan [[Robert Jordan#Illness and death|died in 2007]] while working on what was planned to be the twelfth and final volume in the series.

Additionally, its creation story has similarities to [[Christianity]]'s \"Creator\" ([[Let there be light|Light]]) and Shai'tan, \"The Dark One\" ([[Shaitan]] is an Arabic word that, in [[Islam]]ic contexts, is used as a name for the [[Devil]] or the [[Satan]]). It was also partly inspired by [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]'' ([[1869 in literature|1869]]).<ref>{{cite news|title=Interview with Robert Jordan|work= SFX Magazine |number=16|date= September 1996}}</ref>\n\n''The Wheel of Time'' is notable for its length, detailed [[Fictional universe|imaginary world]], well-developed [[Magic (fantasy)|magic]] system, and large [[:Category:Wheel of Time characters|cast of characters]].

The series depicts fictional, ancient mythology that references [[Modern history|modern Earth history]], while events in the series prefigure real Earth myths. The series takes place about three thousand years after \"The Breaking of the World\", a global cataclysm that ended the \"Age of Legends\", a highly advanced era. Throughout most of the series, the world's technology and institutions are comparable to those of the [[Renaissance]], but with greater equality for women; some cultures are [[Matriarchy|matriarchal]]. Events later in the series prompt advances similar to the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\nThe main setting for the series is the western region or continent of a larger landmass, both unnamed; however, the western region has been called \"The Westlands\" in licensed media, and by author Robert Jordan in interviews. The Westlands contains multiple kingdoms and city-states and is bounded on the east by a mountain range. To the east is a desert, the Aiel Waste, inhabited by the Aiel warrior people, who live in small settlements and whose society is organized into [[clan]]s and warrior societies. Further east is the large and predominantly insular nation of Shara, separated from the Waste by large mountain ranges and other impassable terrain. North of all three regions is the Great Blight, a hostile wilderness inhabited by evil beings. The Westlands are mostly temperate; it and the Aiel Waste are in the world's northern [[Middle latitudes|mid-latitudes]]. Shara extends slightly south of the [[equator]]. Across an ocean west of the Westlands is Seanchan, the name of a landmass and the empire that spans it. Seanchan is narrower from east to west than the other landmass, but extends most of the way between the ice caps from south to north. A large island in the northwest is separated from the Seanchan mainland by a channel. At the beginning of the series, Westlanders are unaware of Seanchan's existence. ''[[The World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time]]'' depicts \"The Land of Madmen\", a small continent in the southern hemisphere, far to the south of the Westlands and the Aiel Waste; it is never mentioned in the main series.\n\nThe series takes place at the end of the \"Third Age\" time period; the Age of Legends was preceded by the \"First Age\", which is implied to be modern Earth. The Third Age in the Westlands was marked by two great upheavals. A thousand years after the Breaking, humanity was nearly overrun by creatures from the Blight in the \"Trolloc Wars\". A thousand years after that, High King Artur Hawkwing unified the region, but his death resulted in the \"War of the Hundred Years\" instead of an orderly dynastic succession. The division of the Westlands into nations changed completely after each of the two events. The Old Tongue, a fictional language from the series, is depicted as a now-dead language, spoken only by scholars and certain nobles, though it still plays a role in the plot of the books.\n\n\"The Pattern\" is a manifestation of both the physical world and people's destinies, while \"the Wheel\" represents the passage of time. These concepts apply to a series of [[Parallel universes in fiction|parallel worlds]], as well. Some characters observe or visit such other worlds; some of these worlds reflect different courses of history, and some are so divergent from the main reality that they are uninhabited. [[Physics]] sometimes operates differently in these worlds. The Seanchan imported \"exotic\" creatures from other worlds, later breeding and training them. Tel'aran'rhiod is the \"world of dreams\", which connects to all of the other worlds. It can be visited in one's sleep, but events there are real; it is also possible to enter physically.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe prequel novel ''[[New Spring]]'' takes place during the Aiel War and depicts the discovery by certain Aes Sedai that the Dragon has been Reborn.\n\nThe series proper commences almost twenty years later in the [[Andor (Wheel of Time)#Two Rivers|Two Rivers]], a near-forgotten district of the country of [[Andor (Wheel of Time)|Andor]]. An Aes Sedai, [[Moiraine Damodred|Moiraine]], and her Warder [[Lan Mandragoran|Lan]], arrive in the village of Emond's Field, secretly aware that servants of the Dark One are searching for a young man living in the area. Moiraine is unable to determine which of three youths ([[Rand al'Thor]], [[Matrim Cauthon]], or [[Perrin Aybara]]) is the Dragon Reborn, and leads all three of them from the Two Rivers, along with their friend [[Egwene al'Vere]]. [[Nynaeve al'Meara]], the village wise-woman, later joins them. [[Itinerant poet|Gleeman]] [[Thom Merrilin]] also travels with the group. The first novel depicts their flight from various agents of the Shadow and their attempts to reach the Aes Sedai city of [[Places in the Wheel of Time series#Tar Valon|Tar Valon]]. Thereafter the protagonists are frequently split into different groups and pursue different missions toward the cause of the Dragon Reborn, sometimes thousands of miles apart. As they struggle to unite the various kingdoms against the Dark One's forces, their task is complicated by rulers of the nations who refuse to lose their autonomy; by the zealots styling themselves 'the Children of the Light', who do not believe in the prophecies; and by the [[Seanchan]], the descendants of a long-lost colony of [[Artur Hawkwing]]'s empire. The Aes Sedai also become divided on how to deal with the Dragon Reborn.\n\nAs the story expands, new characters representing different factions are introduced.\n\n===Tarmon Gai'don===\nDeriving its name from that of [[Armageddon]] in Christian eschatology, Tarmon Gai'don is the apocalyptic battle wherein the Dragon Reborn opposes Shai'tan, while their followers fight elsewhere. Events and portents that foreshadow the Last Battle take place in ''[[Knife of Dreams]]'' and ''[[The Gathering Storm (novel)|The Gathering Storm]]''. The Last Battle takes place in ''[[A Memory of Light]]'', in the form of a 202-page single chapter.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/bryan-maygers/a-memory-of-light-wheel-of-time_b_2429397.html | title=''A Memory of Light'' Review: Brandon Sanderson and Robert Jordan Give a Thrilling End to The Wheel of Time | work=The Huffington Post | date=March 10, 2013 | accessdate=June 19, 2016 | author=Bryan Maygers}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of Wheel of Time characters}}\n\n==Special powers==\nIn the series, many characters possess special powers. Within the fictional world, some of these abilities are widely known and understood, while others are undocumented; some are depicted as unique. Some characters take the reappearance of ancient abilities as a sign that the Last Battle is coming.\n\n=== Channeling ===\n\"Channeling\" is equivalent to [[Magic in fiction|magic as depicted in other fantasy-genre works]], but is never called \"magic\" in the series. Many characters are channelers, including series protagonists Rand al'Thor, Egwene al'Vere, Nynaeve al'Meara, Elayne Trakand, Moiraine Damodred, and Aviendha. Channelers can access a natural power source called the \"One Power\", while Shai'tan can grant access to a separate power, the \"True Power\". Very little is written in the series about the True Power, while the One Power is described extensively. The One Power consists of five elemental \"Powers\": earth, water, air, fire, and spirit. Channelers often have particular strength in at least one Power, more commonly earth and fire in men and water and air in women; strength in spirit is equally rare between the sexes. A channeler creates a \"weave\" to achieve a specific effect by placing individual \"flows\" of the five Powers in a specific geometric configuration. The One Power has two aspects: \"saidin\", used by men; and \"saidar\", used by women. They differ sufficiently that no woman can teach a man to channel (and vice versa), and they can be used in drastically incompatible ways, though they sometimes achieve functionally identical effects. The True Power similarly differs from both. Male channelers are usually stronger than women, but women have advantages at \"linking\" with other channelers to harness more power; an individual's strength is quantified by the amount of the One Power he or she can channel at once. Some men and women are born with the \"spark\" to channel; these individuals will spontaneously begin to channel around puberty, but without formal training three of every four will suffer a fatal illness caused by channeling. Those who survive are called \"wilders\", and often are unaware of the existence or nature of their powers. Channelers are constrained by any restriction they believe applies; wilders often possess a \"block\" that allows them to channel only under specific circumstances (such as experiencing a particular emotion). The majority of channelers lack the spark and will channel only if taught. Channelers can determine if a person of the same sex has the spark or is capable of learning to channel. A channeler with the spark who receives instruction is not at risk of death and is not normally considered a wilder. Channelers have a longer lifespan than non-channelers, in proportion to their strength; from early adulthood, channelers age more slowly than non-channelers, and the strongest channelers can live over 800 years. Shai'tan tainted saidin at the end of the Age of Legends, causing any male channeler to go insane (usually very destructively) and die; the Breaking was caused by the world's male channelers simultaneously going insane, while in the Third Age male channelers are neutralized in various ways as they come of age.\n\nChannelers are treated in different ways by different cultures within the series. In the Westlands, channeling is viewed as synonymous with the Aes Sedai, an organization that survived from the Age of Legends and which views channeling as its proprietary domain; some Aes Sedai refer to channelers from other traditions as \"wilders\", even if they are not self-taught. Aes Sedai are respected in most Westland nations, and they rule the city-state of Tar Valon. Aes Sedai are divided into seven \"ajahs\" named after colors and dedicated to different purposes; Red Ajah members seek out men who can channel and \"gentle\" them (remove their ability to channel). Also in the Westlands are the Kin, consisting of women who studied in Tar Valon but left without becoming Aes Sedai due to lack of desire or ability to complete their training. The Aes Sedai are aware of the Kin, who are very discreet, but are unaware that the Kin actually outnumber them. Among the Sea Folk, a seafaring Westlands culture, female channelers are expected to become \"Windfinders\", ship's navigators; the profession is also open to non-channelers. Every generation, the Sea Folk send a few weak channelers to Tar Valon, successfully concealing the prevalence and strength of their channelers. Aiel channelers are expected to become Wise Ones, the culture's spiritual leaders, as are all Dreamwalkers; other worthy women may become Wise Ones without these special powers. Male Aiel channelers go into the Blight, expecting to die after killing some of Shai'tan's creatures; unbeknownst to the Aiel, Shai'tan actually captures and corrupts these men. Shara is secretly ruled by its female channelers, the Ayyad, through [[figurehead]] monarchs; the Ayyad keep their male offspring as breeding stock before killing them. The Seanchan believe channelers are subhuman and dangerous; they enslave female channelers with the spark, while those capable of acting as their handlers are, unbeknownst to themselves and other Seanchan, those who can learn to channel. Male channelers are executed.\n\nCertain \"objects of the One Power\" exist. \"Angreal\" and \"sa'angreal\" increase the amount of the One Power a channeler can harness; sa'angreal may be [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] more powerful than angreal. \"Ter'angreal\" produce specific effects; some require channeling to function, while others operate continuously or via touch; some affect only channelers or affect them differently.\n\n==== Talents ====\nRobert Jordan uses the capitalized word \"Talent\" to refer to two distinct types of abilities sometimes possessed by channelers; the text also sometimes uses \"Talent\" to refer to abilities unrelated to the One Power and possessed by non-channelers.\n\nOne type of Talent is the aptitude for a particular weave or type of weave. Talents seen in the series include healing (Nynaeve al'Meara), manipulating weather (many Windfinders), creating \"gateways\" for instantaneous travel (Androl Genhald), and fabricating the indestructible substance \"cuendillar\" (Egwene al'Vere). Such a Talent may manifest as finer control over weaves, the ability to use a weave that would otherwise be beyond the channeler's strength, superior results when using a weave with all other factors equal, or some combination of these benefits. Some weaves, such as creating cuendillar, function only for a channeler with a corresponding Talent.\n\nA Talent can also be some other ability possessed only by some channelers, but distinct from creating weaves of the One Power. Talents of this type include creating ter'angreal (Elayne Trakand), perceiving the purpose or function of a ter'angreal (Aviendha), analyzing an expended weave, \"unweaving\" a weave (Aviendha), predicting the weather (Nynaeve al'Meara), recognizing ta'veren on sight (Siuan Sanche and Logain Ablar), and \"Foretelling\" prophecy (Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan).  The latter three Talents have no obvious connection to the One Power, but are described as occurring only in channelers.\n\n=== Other abilities ===\nSome abilities depicted in the Wheel of Time are not related to the One Power or the ability to channel.\n\n\"Dreaming\" (an Aes Sedai term) is the ability to have prophetic dreams, which are usually symbolic rather than literal. \"Dreamwalking\" (an Aiel term) is a set of abilities involving dreaming, including the ability to visit Tel'aran'rhiod and the dreams of others at will, and aptitude for manipulating Tel'aran'rhiod.  Egwene al'Vere is both a Dreamer and Dreamwalker, and the text never establishes whether or not these are two separate things. Dreamwalking is well known to the Aiel Wise ones, who use it for society-wide communication; Aiel Dreamwalkers include channelers Amys and Melaine and the non-channeler Bair, who become Egwene's teachers as the last Aes Sedai Dreamer died about five hundred years earlier.  No man is explicitly identified as a Dreamwalker in the series, but many of the male and female Forsaken, Shai'tan's top lieutenants, appear in Tel'aran'rhiod, and the male Forsaken Ishamael projects himself into other characters' dreams.\n\n\"Ta'veren\" are individuals who are focal points of the Pattern for a time.  Rand al'Thor, Matrim Cauthon, and Perrin Aybara are all ta'veren during the events of the series. The Pattern causes events and the actions of others surrounding a ta'veren to conform to the ta'veren's [[destiny]], usually resulting in occurrences that are possible but unlikely.  Mat has exceptionally good luck at gambling and in battle, while Perrin easily earns the support of others.  Rand's presence often affects a large area around himself, causing such anomalies as one entire village pairing off in marriage in one day, another village erupting into violence over every disagreement its residents ever had, and a city's newborns being free of [[birth defect]]s during Rand's residency.\n\nRand al'Thor is also the \"Dragon Reborn,\" a prophesied savior.  Towards the end of the series, Rand is revealed to be a human tree singer a lost art. He is also shown to have reality warping abilities related to the Dragon Reborn's connection to the Pattern; he kindles a pipe without channeling.\n\nPerrin Aybara and Elyas Machera are \"Wolfbrothers,\" individuals who can communicate telepathically with wolves, which are depicted as [[Sapience|sapient]].  Wolfbrothers also have abilities similar to Dreaming and Dreamwalking, although they are not shown as capable of entering the dreams of others. The souls of wolves inhabit Tel'aran'rhiod, which they call the \"wolf dream,\" and a Wolfbrother who loses his identity as a man may become a wolf there.  Only male Wolfbrothers are depicted in the series.\n\nMin Farshaw sees [[Aura (paranormal)|auras]] and images around people; she does not always understand these visions, but sometimes she instinctively understands them and is always correct in such cases.  Min is the only person in the series depicted as having this ability.  However, the superstitious Seanchan are apparently familiar with it and consider the images to be [[omen]]s; when Empress Fortuona learns that Min possesses this ability, she identifies Min as a \"Doomseer\" and immediately makes her a top advisor.\n\nHurin is a \"sniffer,\" one who can detect violence as an unpleasant odor.  This ability is apparently accepted by his countrymen; it is considered an asset for his career in law enforcement, and Perrin pretends to be a sniffer to conceal that the true source of his insight is communication with wolves.\n\nThe Seanchan produce ter'angreal rings that, when touched with the wearer's blood, grant him or her the abilities of a \"Bloodknife\":  increased strength and speed and the ability to blend into shadows, at the cost of dying within a matter of days or weeks.\n\nThe books describe several scenarios where Shai'tan gives powers to individuals.  People whose souls are removed by Shai'tan become supernaturally inconspicuous \"Gray Men,\" ideal assassins.  Padan Fain serves Shai'tan and is given the ability to track Rand al'Thor. Padan Fain later merges with the ghost of the evil Mordeth, gaining the abilities to inculcate others with paranoia and to summon and control a deadly miasma.  Shai'tan merges the bodies and souls of Isam Mandragoran and Luc Mantear into the individual known as Slayer, to whom Shai'tan grants powers involving Tel'aran'rhiod, including the ability to travel instantaneously between there and the physical world while awake and without the use of a gateway.\n\n== Books in the series ==\n{{Episode table |background=#93B8C4 |overall= |title= |airdate=

Alan Romanczuk and Maria Simons were Robert Jordan's editorial assistants. The book is an encapsulating glossary of the entire series.\n\n==Development==\n===Writing and conception===\nIn the early 1980s Robert Jordan wrote several [[Conan the Barbarian]] novels for Tor Books, including a [[novelization]] of the movie ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]''. These proved successful and in 1984 he proposed an idea for an epic fantasy series of three books to Tom Doherty, the head of [[Tor Books]].<ref name=\"peterahlstrom.blogspot.com\"/> Doherty approved the idea; however, knowing that Jordan had a tendency to go long, Doherty put Jordan on contract for six books just in case.  Jordan began writing the novel that became ''The Eye of the World''.<ref name=\"peterahlstrom.blogspot.com\"/>\n\nThe novel proved extremely difficult to write and characters and storylines changed considerably during the writing process. The series was originally centered on an older man who discovered relatively late in life that he was the 'chosen one' who had to save the world. However, Jordan deliberately decided to move closer to the tone and style of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' and made the characters younger and less experienced.<ref name=\"thewertzone\">{{cite web|url=http://thewertzone.blogspot.ca/2018/01/the-genesis-of-wheel-of-time.html |title=The Genesis of the Wheel of Time |last=Whitehead |first=Adam |date=2018-01-07 |accessdate=2018-01-08}}</ref> Once this decision had been made, writing proceeded much more easily and Jordan completed the second volume, ''[[The Great Hunt]]'', at roughly the same time the first book was published.<ref>Foreword dated February 1990, ''The Great Hunt'' by Robert Jordan, published by Tor Books</ref>\n\nTom Doherty enjoyed ''The Eye of the World'' so much that he declared it would be the biggest fantasy series since Tolkien,{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}  and took the unprecedented steps of sending free review copies to every bookstore in the United States to generate interest.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} The combined hardcover and trade paperback run of the novel sold out of its initial 40,000-strong print run. Sales then doubled with the publication of the second novel just eight months later generating more interest in the first book.<ref name=\"peterahlstrom.blogspot.com\"/>\n\nJordan wrote full-time at breakneck speed for the next several years until he completed the seventh volume, ''[[A Crown of Swords]]'', at which point he slowed down, delivering a book every two years. Fans objected when he took some time off to expand a short story into a prequel novel called ''New Spring'', so he decided to shelve his plans for additional prequels in favor of finishing off the last two volumes in the series. He rejected criticisms of the later volumes of the series slowing down in pace in order to concentrate on minor secondary characters at the expense of the main characters from the opening volumes, but acknowledged that his structure for the tenth volume, ''[[Crossroads of Twilight]]'' (where he showed a major scene from the prior book, ''[[Winter's Heart]]'', from the perspective of the main characters that were not involved in the scene), had not worked out as he had planned.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} ''[[Knife of Dreams]]'', the eleventh volume, had a much more positive reception from critics and fans alike and Jordan announced the twelfth volume, which he had previously announced would have the working title ''A Memory of Light'', would conclude the series.\n\n===Author's death and final books===\n{{See also|A Memory of Light|The Gathering Storm (novel)|Towers of Midnight}}\nJordan had stated that the main sequence would conclude with the twelfth book, ''[[A Memory of Light]]''.

It has been in operation almost continuously (there was a significant outage during 2013\u201314) since 1993. Notably, the ''WoTMUD'' had gained written permission from the author to use his creation including all but major characters.\n\nA [[The Wheel of Time (video game)|''Wheel of Time'' computer game]] was released in 1999. Over the course of the game, a lone Aes Sedai must track down a robber following an assault on the White Tower, and prevent the Dark One from being released prematurely. She eventually learns of and executes a long-forgotten ritual at Shayol Ghul to ensure the Dark Lord remains sealed within the prison. While Robert Jordan was consulted in the creation of the game, he did not write the storyline himself and the game is not considered [[Canon (fiction)|canon]].\n\n''[[The Wheel of Time Roleplaying Game]]'' was released in 2001 from [[Wizards of the Coast]] using the [[d20 system|d20]] rules developed for the third edition of the [[Dungeons and Dragons]] game. The game had a single adventure module published in 2002, ''Prophecies of the Dragon''. Shortly after the release of the adventure book Wizards of the Coast announced they would not be releasing any further products for the game. Robert Jordan cited some problems with the roleplaying game, such as storyline details in the adventure module that contradicted the books.\n\nIn early 2009 [[Electronic Arts|EA Games]] announced that they had bought the rights for a MMORPG, with the plan to publish it through the EA Partners-Program.

This \"fire-stick farming\", or \"burning off\", reduces the fuel-load for a potential major bush fire, while fertilising the ground and increasing the number of young plants, providing additional food for [[kangaroo]]s and other fauna hunted for meat.

This \"fire-stick farming\", or \"burning off\", reduces the fuel-load for a potential major bush fire, while fertilising the ground and increasing the number of young plants, providing additional food for [[kangaroo]]s and other fauna hunted for meat.
