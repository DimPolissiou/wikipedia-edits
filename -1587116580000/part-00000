''O. unilateralis'' infects [[ant]]s of the [[Camponotini]] tribe, with the full pathogenesis being characterized by alteration of the behavioral patterns of the infected ant. Infected hosts leave their canopy nests and foraging trails for the forest floor, an area with a temperature and humidity suitable for fungal growth; they then use their [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandible]]s to attach themselves to a major vein on the underside of a leaf, where the host remains after its eventual death.<ref name = \"Mongkolsamrit2012\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mongkolsamrit S, Kobmoo N, Tasanathai K, Khonsanit A, Noisripoom W, Srikitikulchai P, Somnuk R, Luangsa-ard JJ | title = Life cycle, host range and temporal variation of ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis''/''Hirsutella formicarium'' on Formicine ants | journal = Journal of Invertebrate Pathology | volume = 111 | issue = 3 | pages = 217\u201324 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22959811 | doi = 10.1016/j.jip.2012.08.007 }}</ref> The process leading to mortality takes 4\u201310 days, and includes a reproductive stage where [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruiting bodies]] grow from the ant's head, rupturing to release the fungus's spores. ''O. unilateralis'' is, in turn, also susceptible to fungal infection itself, an occurrence that can limit its impact on ant populations, which has otherwise been known to devastate ant colonies.\n\n''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis'' and related species are known to engage in an active [[secondary metabolism]], among other reasons, for the production of substances active as antibacterial agents that protect the fungus-host ecosystem against further pathogenesis during fungal reproduction. Because of this secondary metabolism, an interest in the species has been taken by [[natural product]]s chemists, with corresponding discovery of small molecule agents (e.g. of the [[polyketide]] family) of potential interest for use as human immunomodulatory, anti-infective, and anticancer agents.\n\n==Systematics==\n\nAfter years of research, the taxonomy of ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis'' is becoming increasingly clear. \n\n=== ''Cordyceps'' vs ''Ophiocordyceps'' ===\n\nThroughout history there has been confusion about the distinction between both the ''[[Cordyceps]]'' [[genus]] and the ''[[Ophiocordyceps]]'' genus. These genera are different, however they were at the source of many debates about whether the zombie-ant fungus (and other fungi) belonged to one or to the other as ''Ophiocordyceps'' was only recently brought forward.\n\nThe ''Cordyceps'' genus comprises over 400 species, historically classified in the ''[[Clavicipitaceae]]'' [[family (biology)|family]] within the [[order (biology)|order]] ''[[Hypocreales]]''. The classification was based on different morphological characteristics such as filiform [[ascospores]] and cylindrical [[asci]].<ref name = \"Sung2007\">{{cite journal |last1=Sung |first1=Gi-Ho |last2=Hywel-Jones |first2=Nigel L. |last3=Sung |first3=Jae-Mo |last4=Luangsa-ard |first4=J.

However, in 2007, important new molecular data was tested, and enabled them to re-classify the ''Clavicipitaceae'' family. It was found that \u2018\u2019Clavicipitaceae\u2019\u2019 was in fact three distinct monophyletic families: the ''Clavicipitaceae'', the ''Cordycipitaceae'' and the ''Ophiocordycipitaceae''.<ref name = \"Sung2007\"/>\n \nThe new molecular phylogenetics studies contradicted the older classification and moved all ''Cordyceps'' species forming a sister group with ''Tolypocladium'', into ''Ophiocordycipitaceae''. Fungi able to parasitize ants were also included in the transfer, such as ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' which was later renamed ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis''.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/> Following this study, multiple traits such as the production of darkly pigmented, hard to flexible [[stromata]] were defined as characteristics of the ''Ophiocordycipitaceae'' family.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\n\nConsequently, as phylogenetic tools improved, ''O. unilateralis'' was moved from ''Cordyceps'' to ''Ophiocordyceps''.

Following this, a study conducted in Brazil delimited using morphological comparison of the ascospores, germination process and asexual morphs, four different ''Ophiocordyceps'' species. Afterwards, three new species were described in the Brazilian Amazon, six in Thailand, and one in Japan. These findings provided increasing evidence for ''O. unilateralis'' being actually a complex a species.<ref name = \"Evans2018\"/>\n\nMore recently in 2018, 15 new species were described. They first used classic taxonomic criteria, and macro-morphological data with a deeper focus on ascospore and asexual morphology in order to delimit and classify species composing ''O. unilateralis s.l.''. \nThe asexual morphologies enabled to distinguish two different [[clades]] mainly composed of [[myrmecophilous|species associated with ants]] which they termed \u201c''O. unilateralis'' core clade\u201d and \u201c''O. kniphofioides'' sub-clade\u201d.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\n\nAfterwards, in the same study, they conducted further analysis using a set of different traits. They used morphological traits analysis which included both macro-morphological characters and microscopic traits. The macro-morphological characteristics consist of: the typical single stroma arising from the host\u2019s dorsal pronotum, the [[ascoma]] (perithecia) growing from the stroma. The microscopic traits consisted of: the morphology of the ascospores in terms of size, shape, [[septation]] and germination. Finally, they used other traits such as the host and the location of the death grip.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\nWith these analyses, they identified different morphologies which enabled them to distribute 14 new species within the core clade, and one within the sub-clade. Moreover, species in the ''O. kniphofioides'' sub-clade specialized on [[neotropical]] ants, whereas species in the core clade specialized on ''Camponotini'' species.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\n\n\n'''Species within the ''O. unilateralis'' core clade as described in 2018'''<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>:\n* ''O. albacongiuae''\n* ''O. blakebarnesii''\n* ''O. camponoti-atricipis''\n* ''O. camponoti-balzani''\n* ''O. camponoti-bispinosi''\n* ''O. camponoti-chartificis''\n* ''O. camponoti-femorati''\n* ''O. camponoti-floridani''\n* ''O. camponoti-hippocrepidis''\n* ''O. camponoti-indiani''\n* ''O. camponoti-leonardi''\n* ''O. camponoti- melanotic''\n* ''O. camponoti-nidulantis''\n* ''O. camponoti-novogranadensis''\n* ''O. camponoti-renggeri''\n* ''O. camponoti-saundersi''\n* ''O. halabalaensis''\n* ''O. kimflemingiae''\n* ''O. naomipierceae''\n* ''O. ootakii''\n* ''O. polyrhachis-furcata''\n* ''O. pulvinata''\n* ''O. rami''\n* ''O. satoi''\n\n\n'''Species within the ''O. kniphofioides'' sub-clade as described in 2018'''<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>:\n* ''O. daceti''\n* ''O. kniphofioides''\n\n== Morphology ==\n\n[[File:Schematic drawing of Ophiocordyceps unilateralis morphology on an infected ant.png|thumb|350px|right|Schematic representation of ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis'' growing out of an infected host ant]]\n\n=== Typical morphology ===\n\nThe zombie-ant fungus is easily identifiable when its reproductive structure becomes apparent on its dead host, usually a carpenter ant.

Different [[sub-species]] of ant can occur within the same area, which means that in order to coexist they have to occupy different [[ecological niches]]. Consequently, the fungi may have evolved at the subspecies level in order to maximize its [[fitness (biology)|fitness]].<ref name = \"Evans2018\"/>\n\n'''''O. unilateralis'' core clade morphological characteristics'''<br>\n\nThe ''O. unilateralis'' core clade, as described by Araujo et al in 2018, has distinct morphological characteristics. It exhibits a single stroma with a ''Hirsutella'' asexual morph, which arises from the dorsal neck region of the dead ant and produces a dark brown perithecia attached to its stalk.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\nThese species are also recognizable through the host species they infect, which are only ''Camponotini'' species. Once the host is killed by the fungus, it is commonly found fixed through their mandibles onto the surfaces of leaves.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\n\n'''''O. kniphofioides'' sub-clade morphological characteristics'''<br>\n\nThe ''O. kniphofioides'' sub-clade, as described by Araujo et al in 2018, also has distinct morphological characteristics. Its species produce a stroma that grows laterally from the host\u2019s thorax which itself generates an orange [[ascoma]]. Moreover, species within this sub-clade share a ''Hirsutella'' asexual morph.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\nAs for the core clade, these species are also recognizable through the hosts they infect, which are usually neotropical ant species. The sub-clade does not present the same extended phenotype with the famous \u201cdeath grip\u201d that O. unilateralis species typically exhibit. Their hosts usually die at the base of large trees in the Amazonian rainforest, among the moss carpets.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\n\n== Life cycle ==\n\nLike other fungi pathogenic to insects in the genus ''[[Ophiocordyceps]]'', ''O. unilateralis'' targets a specific host species, ''Camponotus Leonardi''. However, the fungus may parasitize other closely related species of ants with lesser degrees of host manipulation and reproductive success.<ref name=Sample />\n\nThe changes in the behavior of the infected ants are very specific, giving rise to the popular term \"zombie ants\", and are tuned for the benefit of the fungus. The spores of the fungus attach to and eventually break through the ant's exoskeleton using mechanical pressure and enzymes.<ref name=\"pmc-3204140\" /> Yeast stages of the fungus spread in the ant's body and presumably produce compounds that affect the ant's [[hemocoel]], using the evolutionary trait of an [[extended phenotype]] to manipulate the behavioral patterns exhibited by the ant.<ref name=\"Andersen\" /> An infected ant exhibits irregularly timed full-body convulsions that dislodge it to the forest floor.<ref name=\"Hughes, D.

For this purpose, the fungus\u2019 [[hypha]] pierces the [[exoskeleton]] using enzymes such as [[chitinase]], [[lipase]] and [[protease]], combined with mechanical pressure.<ref name=pmc-3204140/>\n\n* '''Convulsions and climbing behaviour'''<br>\n\nAfter the fungus enters the ant it propagates, and fungal cells can be found beside the host\u2019s brain. Once the population is of sufficient size, the fungus takes over the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), which enables it to manipulate the ant to reach the forest floor and climb up the vegetation.<ref name = \"deBekkerA2014\"/>\n\nTwo candidate compounds, [[sphingosine]] and guanidinobutyric acid (GBA), were identified as responsible for the manipulation of the host brain. Both of these metabolites are known in the scientific world to be involved in neurological disorders. However, more research is needed in the field to determine whether other fungal metabolites interact with the host brain and cause higher levels of sphingosine and GBA in the brain.<ref name = \"deBekkerA2014\"/>\n\nSome studies identified another compound, hypoxanthine, present at high extracellular concentration. Hypoxanthine has deleterious effects on neural tissues of the cerebral cortex, which in the context of zombie ants may indicate a way for the fungus to alter the motor neurons of the ant, consequently affecting its behavior.<ref name = \"Shanshan2019\"/>\n\n* '''Death grip'''<br>\n\nThe famous \u201cdeath grip\u201d exhibited by the ant is also a result of the fungus-induced manipulation. The behavior consists in the ant biting the leaf so tightly that the ant is prevented from falling as it dies hanging upside down, consequently enabling the proper growth of the fungus\u2019 fruiting body.<ref name = \"deBekker2014\"/>\n\nThis is possibly a result of the atrophication of the ant\u2019s mandibular muscles caused by the secretion of fungal compounds. In multiple studies, fungal cell populations were found within atrophied mandibular muscle tissues. In fact, they infiltrate between the muscle fibers and it is a common hypothesis of researchers that they cause the muscles\u2019 atrophication the secretion of chemicals.<ref name = \"Shanshan2019\"/>\nSignificant decreases in [[leucine]] concentration and [[mitochondria]] number were identified in infected ants. A deficit in leucine results in the prevention of muscle regeneration because the amino acid is a nutrient regulator of muscle protein synthesis. A decrease in mitochondria ultimately results in a reduction of energy and calcium levels due to the lack of [[ATP]] and [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] which provides [[calcium]] for [[actin]]-[[myosin]] binding which is essential for muscle cells.<ref name = \"Shanshan2019\"/>\n\nMore in depth research is needed for the identification of other fungal compounds which act to atrophy the mandibular muscles, and for the understanding of their exact effects on the ant.\n\n'''Natural products are host specific'''\n\nAnother study tested the effects of ''O. unilateralis'' on different ant species. The ant species which are normally found infected in nature exhibited a manipulated behavior, whereas the species which are not typically infected were killed by the infection, but their behavior was not altered. This is likely due to the heterogeneous nature of the fungus which secretes different metabolites according to host species.<ref name = \"deBekkerA2014\"/>\n\n== Geographic distribution ==\n\nMany studies describe ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis'' distribution as [[pantropical]] since it occurs mainly in [[tropical forest]] ecosystems<ref name = \"EvansHC2011\"/>.

To do so, ''O. unilateralis'' fortifies the ant cadaver to prevent its decay, which consequently ensures the growth of the fruiting body. Therefore, the zombie-ant fungus adapts to the short viability of its spores by increasing their production using the dead ant.<ref name = \"Andersen2012\" />\n\n== Host adaptation ==\n\nThe principal hosts of ''O. unilateralis'' evolved adaptive behaviours enable to limit the contact rate between uninfected susceptible hosts and infected hosts, thereby reducing the risk of transmission. \n\n''O.unilateralis\u2019'' principal hosts evolved efficient behavioral forms of social immunity. In fact, the ants clean the exoskeletons of one another in order to decrease the presence of spores which are attached to their cuticle.<ref name=\"Hughes, D. P. 2011\"/> Studies also show that ants can sense that a member of the colony is infected; resulting in healthy ants carry the ''O. unilateralis''-infected individual far away from the colony to avoid fungal spore exposure.[4][5] Plus, there are reports testifying that most worker ants remain inside the nest boundaries, consequently, only foragers are at risk of infection.<ref name = \"Andersen2012\" /> \n\nMoreover, one of the fungus' principal hosts, ''Camponotus leonardi'' which occurs in tropical forests of Thailand, provided evidence for the avoidance of the forest floor by the host ants as a defence method.<ref name = \"Pontoppidan2009\"/> In areas where ''O. unilateralis'' is present, ''C. leonardi'' builds its nests high in the canopy, and has a broad network of areal trails. These trails occasionally move down to the ground level, where infection and graveyards occur, due to canopy gaps too difficult for the ants to cross. Studies show that when the trails descend to the forest floor, their length is only of three to five meters before going back up into the canopy. This demonstrates the avoidance of the zones of infection by the ants. Additionally, more evidence participates in the favour of this defence method being adaptive as it is not observed in undisturbed forests where the zombie-ant fungus is not present.<ref name = \"Pontoppidan2009\"/>\n\n== Genetic Basis of Behavioral Manipulation ==\n\nOphiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato is an Entomopathogenic fungi, meaning it is a parasite of insects. Parasites obtain their necessities of life by appropriating nutrients from a host, Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, are no exception to this concept of the nature of a parasite (1-5). One of the most notable traits of Ophiocordyceps unilateralis in the behavior it manipulates in the host ants to maximize their own lifetime reproductive fitness (2,4).  The Ophiocordyceps unilateralis is of great interest for many reasons, one of which is its ability to manipulate their hosts behaviors without destroying the brain (1,2,3).\nInfected ant hosts have been observed climbing up vegetation and biting onto it such tat they hang off the grass. It has been suggested that these hosts hang off of the vegetation in a position that is optimal for the fungi to have maximum dispersal (2,3). This behavior is known as an extended phenotype, otherwise described as the ability for a parasites genotype to be expressed in the hosts phenotype.\nIt was hypothesized that this fungus penetrates the brain (2), however, some experiments have found Ophiocordyceps unilateralis cells are present throughout the body, but not in the brain (3). Fungal cells have been identified as hyphal bodies which take the form of yeast-like cells and grow inside the ant\u2019s bodies. The other type of fungal cell is hyphae which are filamentous branch-like structure which allow for the fungus to spread to other tissues within the host (3). It has been found that the fungal cells never actually degrade or invade the brain of the host (1,3). \nTo better understand how exactly this fungus is able to invade and manipulate the ant hosts muscles, 3-dimensional (3D) structures of this parasite-host interaction were constructed (3). Experiments have shown that hyphae fungal cells surround the ants muscle fibers, especially in the legs (3). It has also been noted that these fungal cells interact with each other via conidial tubes. These tubes allow for the transfer of cellular information between the different muscle fibers which they surround and penetrate (3). Frederickson et al. found that these cell\u2013cell connections resulted in a 3D network of hyphal bodies that surrounded the muscle fiber as seen in the following figure (3).\n from Frederickson et al. \nSeveral studies have been done on entomopathogenic fungi to try and understand the genetic basis of this ability to alter their host\u2019s behaviors. Will et al. research used comparative transcriptomics (compared RNA sequences) between different entomopathogenic fungi-ant species interactions to see if there were any candidate genes which underly the manipulation of the ant\u2019s behavior (2). \n\n  from Will I et al.\nThe figure above shows the major genetic themes in infected host ants between various species of entomopathogenic fungi obtained from Will et al\u2019s comparative transcriptomics results and the associated behaviors of the hosts. Will et al. found that there were several recurring candidate genes found in infected hosts (5). Will et all\u2019s findings corroborate past literature by finding genetic basis of the extended phenotype. They saw changes in gene expression which modifies nutritional physiology and neuronal-activity. of the host (5).  One of the manipulations is to odor receptors where they observed regulation changes in odor receptor genes and binding proteins. Communication between ants relies on pheromone and odor detection, resulting in impaired response to external stimuli (5). is a disruption to the hosts innate circadian rhythms and caste identities  (1-5). There is still much to learn about the genetic basis of these relationships but understanding how a host is manipulated by these entomopathogenic fungi.\n\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|35em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Sample>{{cite news | first = Ian | last = Sample | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/aug/18/zombie-carpenter-ant-fungus | title = 'Zombie ants' controlled by parasitic fungus for 48m years | date = 18 August 2010 | department = News \u00bb Science \u00bb Microbiology | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=ponto>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pontoppidan MB, Himaman W, Hywel-Jones NL, Boomsma JJ, Hughes DP | title = Graveyards on the move: The spatio-temporal distribution of dead ''Ophiocordyceps''-infected ants | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = e4835 | date = 12 March 2009 | pmid = 19279680 | pmc = 2652714 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004835 | bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.4835P }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=sung>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sung GH, Hywel-Jones NL, Sung JM, Luangsa-Ard JJ, Shrestha B, Spatafora JW | title = Phylogenetic classification of ''Cordyceps'' and the clavicipitaceous fungi | journal = Studies in Mycology | volume = 57 | issue = 1 | pages = 5\u201359 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18490993 | pmc = 2104736 | doi = 10.3114/sim.2007.57.01 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Zombie>{{cite news | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100818105730.htm | title = Fossil Reveals 48-Million-Year History of Zombie Ants | publisher = [[Science Daily]] | date = 18 August 2010 | accessdate = 2010-09-12}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=MBank>{{cite web | url = http://www.mycobank.org/MycoTaxo.aspx?Link=T&Rec=281145 | title = Ophiocordyceps unilateralis | website = [[MycoBank]] | publisher = [[International Mycological Association]] | accessdate = 2011-07-19}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Hughes>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hughes DP, Wappler T, Labandeira CC | title = Ancient death-grip leaf scars reveal ant fungal parasitism | journal = [[Biology Letters]] | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 67\u201370 | date = 23 February 2011 | pmid = 20719770 | pmc = 3030878 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2010.0521 | origyear = 18 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Andersen>{{cite journal | vauthors = Andersen SB, Gerritsma S, Yusah KM, Mayntz D, Hywel-Jones NL, Billen J, Boomsma JJ, Hughes DP | title = The life of a dead ant: The expression of an adaptive extended phenotype | journal = [[The American Naturalist]] | volume = 174 | issue = 3 | pages = 424\u2013433 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19627240 | doi = 10.1086/603640 | jstor = 10.1086/603640 | url = https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/en/publications/the-life-of-a-dead-ant(e6374602-b2a0-496c-b78e-774b34fb152b).html }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Xiao>{{cite journal | vauthors = Xiao JH, Zhong JJ | title = Secondary metabolites from ''Cordyceps'' species and their antitumor activity studies | journal = Recent Patents on Biotechnology | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 123\u2013137 | year = 2007 | pmid = 19075836 | doi = 10.2174/187220807780809454 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Wongsa>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wongsa P, Tasanatai K, Watts P, Hywel-Jones N | title = Isolation and ''in vitro'' cultivation of the insect pathogenic fungus ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' | journal = [[Mycological Research]] | volume = 109 | issue = Pt 8 | pages = 936\u2013940 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16175796 | doi = 10.1017/S0953756205003321 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Unagul>{{cite journal | vauthors = Unagul P, Wongsa P, Kittakoop P, Intamas S, Srikitikulchai P, Tanticharoen M | title = Production of red pigments by the insect pathogenic fungus ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' BCC 1869 | journal = Journal of Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 135\u2013140 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15891934 | doi = 10.1007/s10295-005-0213-6 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Kittakoopa>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kittakoopa P, Punyaa J, Kongsaeree P, Lertwerawat Y, Jintasirikul A, Tanticharoena M, Thebtaranonth Y | year = 1999 | title = Bioactive naphthoquinones from ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' | journal = Phytochemistry | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 453\u2013457 | doi = 10.1016/S0031-9422(99)00272-1}}</ref>\n}}\n<ref> de Bekker, C., Ohm, R.

Because of this secondary metabolism, an interest in the species has been taken by [[natural product]]s chemists, with corresponding discovery of small molecule agents (e.g. of the [[polyketide]] family) of potential interest for use as human immunomodulatory, anti-infective, and anticancer agents.\n\n==Systematics==\n\nAfter years of research, the taxonomy of ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis'' is becoming increasingly clear. \n\n=== ''Cordyceps'' vs ''Ophiocordyceps'' ===\n\nThroughout history there has been confusion about the distinction between both the ''[[Cordyceps]]'' [[genus]] and the ''[[Ophiocordyceps]]'' genus. These genera are different, however they were at the source of many debates about whether the zombie-ant fungus (and other fungi) belonged to one or to the other as ''Ophiocordyceps'' was only recently brought forward.\n\nThe ''Cordyceps'' genus comprises over 400 species, historically classified in the ''[[Clavicipitaceae]]'' [[family (biology)|family]] within the [[order (biology)|order]] ''[[Hypocreales]]''. The classification was based on different morphological characteristics such as filiform [[ascospores]] and cylindrical [[asci]].<ref name = \"Sung2007\">{{cite journal |last1=Sung |first1=Gi-Ho |last2=Hywel-Jones |first2=Nigel L. |last3=Sung |first3=Jae-Mo |last4=Luangsa-ard |first4=J.

It was found that \u2018\u2019Clavicipitaceae\u2019\u2019 was in fact three distinct monophyletic families: the ''Clavicipitaceae'', the ''Cordycipitaceae'' and the ''Ophiocordycipitaceae''.<ref name = \"Sung2007\"/>\n \nThe new molecular phylogenetics studies contradicted the older classification and moved all ''Cordyceps'' species forming a sister group with ''Tolypocladium'', into ''Ophiocordycipitaceae''.

Following this, a study conducted in Brazil delimited using morphological comparison of the ascospores, germination process and asexual morphs, four different ''Ophiocordyceps'' species. Afterwards, three new species were described in the Brazilian Amazon, six in Thailand, and one in Japan. These findings provided increasing evidence for ''O. unilateralis'' being actually a complex a species.<ref name = \"Evans2018\"/>\n\nMore recently in 2018, 15 new species were described. They first used classic taxonomic criteria, and macro-morphological data with a deeper focus on ascospore and asexual morphology in order to delimit and classify species composing ''O. unilateralis s.l.''. \nThe asexual morphologies enabled to distinguish two different [[clades]] mainly composed of [[myrmecophilous|species associated with ants]] which they termed \u201c''O. unilateralis'' core clade\u201d and \u201c''O. kniphofioides'' sub-clade\u201d.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\n\nAfterwards, in the same study, they conducted further analysis using a set of different traits.

For this purpose, the fungus\u2019 [[hypha]] pierces the [[exoskeleton]] using enzymes such as [[chitinase]], [[lipase]] and [[protease]], combined with mechanical pressure.<ref name=pmc-3204140/>\n\n* '''Convulsions and climbing behaviour'''<br>\n\nAfter the fungus enters the ant it propagates, and fungal cells can be found beside the host\u2019s brain. Once the population is of sufficient size, the fungus takes over the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), which enables it to manipulate the ant to reach the forest floor and climb up the vegetation.<ref name = \"deBekkerA2014\"/>\n\nTwo candidate compounds, [[sphingosine]] and guanidinobutyric acid (GBA), were identified as responsible for the manipulation of the host brain. Both of these metabolites are known in the scientific world to be involved in neurological disorders. However, more research is needed in the field to determine whether other fungal metabolites interact with the host brain and cause higher levels of sphingosine and GBA in the brain.<ref name = \"deBekkerA2014\"/>\n\nSome studies identified another compound, hypoxanthine, present at high extracellular concentration. Hypoxanthine has deleterious effects on neural tissues of the cerebral cortex, which in the context of zombie ants may indicate a way for the fungus to alter the motor neurons of the ant, consequently affecting its behavior.<ref name = \"Shanshan2019\"/>\n\n* '''Death grip'''<br>\n\nThe famous \u201cdeath grip\u201d exhibited by the ant is also a result of the fungus-induced manipulation. The behavior consists in the ant biting the leaf so tightly that the ant is prevented from falling as it dies hanging upside down, consequently enabling the proper growth of the fungus\u2019 fruiting body.<ref name = \"deBekker2014\"/>\n\nThis is possibly a result of the atrophication of the ant\u2019s mandibular muscles caused by the secretion of fungal compounds. In multiple studies, fungal cell populations were found within atrophied mandibular muscle tissues. In fact, they infiltrate between the muscle fibers and it is a common hypothesis of researchers that they cause the muscles\u2019 atrophication the secretion of chemicals.<ref name = \"Shanshan2019\"/>\nSignificant decreases in [[leucine]] concentration and [[mitochondria]] number were identified in infected ants. A deficit in leucine results in the prevention of muscle regeneration because the amino acid is a nutrient regulator of muscle protein synthesis. A decrease in mitochondria ultimately results in a reduction of energy and calcium levels due to the lack of [[ATP]] and [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] which provides [[calcium]] for [[actin]]-[[myosin]] binding which is essential for muscle cells.<ref name = \"Shanshan2019\"/>\n\nMore in depth research is needed for the identification of other fungal compounds which act to atrophy the mandibular muscles, and for the understanding of their exact effects on the ant.\n\n'''Natural products are host specific'''\n\nAnother study tested the effects of ''O. unilateralis'' on different ant species. The ant species which are normally found infected in nature exhibited a manipulated behavior, whereas the species which are not typically infected were killed by the infection, but their behavior was not altered. This is likely due to the heterogeneous nature of the fungus which secretes different metabolites according to host species.<ref name = \"deBekkerA2014\"/>\n\n== Geographic distribution ==\n\nMany studies describe ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis'' distribution as [[pantropical]] since it occurs mainly in [[tropical forest]] ecosystems<ref name = \"EvansHC2011\"/>.

It has also been reported that polyketides have other therapeutic effects such as antitumor, antioxidant and antiaging activities.<ref name = \"Amnuaykanjanasin2009\">{{cite journal |last1=Amnuaykanjanasin |first1=Alongkorn |last2=Phonghanpot |first2=Suranat |last3=Sengpanich |first3=Nattapong |last4=Cheevadhanarak |first4=Supapon |last5=Tanticharoen |first5=Morakot |title=Insect-Specific Polyketide Synthases (PKSs), Potential PKS-Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Hybrids, and Novel PKS Clades in Tropical Fungi |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |date=1 June 2009 |volume=75 |issue=11 |pages=3721\u20133732 |URL=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2687288/}}</ref> Therefore, these medicinal potentials provide important therapeutical value for the zombie-ant fungus.\n\n== Fungal hyperparasite ==\n\n''O. unilateralis'' suffers from an unidentified fungal [[hyperparasite]], reported in the lay press as the \"antizombie-fungus fungus\", that results in only 6\u20137% of [[sporangium|sporangia]] being viable, limiting the damage ''O. unilateralis'' inflicts on ant colonies. The hyperparasite moves in to attack ''O. unilateralis'' as the fungal stalk emerges from the ant's body, which can stop the stalk from releasing its spores.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://science.psu.edu/news-and-events/2012-news/Hughes4-2012 | publisher = Pennsylvania State University | title = The Zombie-Ant Fungus Is Under Attack, Research Reveals | date = 2012-05-02 | accessdate = 2013-03-04}}</ref><ref name = \"Andersen_2012\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Andersen SB, Ferrari M, Evans HC, Elliot SL, Boomsma JJ, Hughes DP | title = Disease Dynamics in a Specialized Parasite of Ant Societies | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | page = e36352 | date = 2 May 2012 | pmid = 22567151 | pmc = 3342268 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0036352 | bibcode = 2012PLoSO...736352A }}</ref>\n\nThe <!-- density of infected ants and --> graveyards of dead ants are numerous and spread throughout the surrounding area of the colony. Though ''O. unilateralis'' is very virulent, only about 6.5% of all fruiting bodies are viable spore producers. This is caused by the weakening of the fungus by the hyperparasite, which may limit the viability of infectious spores. Ants also groom each other to combat microscopic organisms that could potentially harm the colony. <!-- This shows that the colony is not in as much danger as previously thought. --> Additional fungi grant beneficial assistance to the colony, as well.<ref name = \"Andersen_2012\"/>\n\n== Parasite adaptation ==\n\nIn host-parasite dynamics, both the host and the parasite are under selective pressure: the parasite evolves to increase its transmission, whereas the host evolves to avoid and/or resist the infection by the parasite. <br>\n\n=== Extended phenotype ===\n\nSome parasites have evolved to manipulate their host\u2019s behavior in order to increase their transmission to uninfected susceptible individuals, thereby increasing their fitness.<ref name = \"Pontoppidan2009\">{{cite journal |last1=Pontoppidan |first1=Maj-Britt |last2=Himaman |first2=Winanda |last3=Hywel-Jones |first3=Nigel L. |last4=Boomsma |first4=Jacobus J. |last5=Hughes |first5=David P. |last6=Dornhaus |first6=Anna |title=Graveyards on the Move: The Spatio-Temporal Distribution of Dead ''Ophiocordyceps''-Infected Ants |journal=PLoS ONE |date=12 March 2009 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=e4835 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0004835}}</ref> This host manipulation is termed the \"extended phenotype\" of the parasite and is a form of adaptation.

This height is considered to be optimal for fungal growth due to its humidity level and temperature. This is followed by a \u201cdeath grip\u201d of the infected ant once at what is considered to be the optimal conditions for post-mortem fungal development. This leads to the fungus continuing its growth and releasing fungal spores onto the forest floor.<ref name = \"deBekker2014\"/> These spores will then be encountered by the ants which, when the aerial foraging route is not possible, have to occasionally descend to ground level.<ref name = \"Pontoppidan2009\"/> Therefore, '' O. unilateralis'' controls the ant's behaviour and this manipulation represents an adaptation for the fungus where natural selection is acting on its genes with the purpose of increasing the fungus' fitness.<ref name = \"deBekker2014\">{{cite journal |last1=de Bekker |first1=C. |last2=Merrow |first2=M. |last3=Hughes |first3=D.

To do so, ''O. unilateralis'' fortifies the ant cadaver to prevent its decay, which consequently ensures the growth of the fruiting body. Therefore, the zombie-ant fungus adapts to the short viability of its spores by increasing their production using the dead ant.<ref name = \"Andersen2012\" />\n\n== Host adaptation ==\n\nThe principal hosts of ''O. unilateralis'' evolved adaptive behaviours enable to limit the contact rate between uninfected susceptible hosts and infected hosts, thereby reducing the risk of transmission. \n\n''O.unilateralis\u2019'' principal hosts evolved efficient behavioral forms of social immunity. In fact, the ants clean the exoskeletons of one another in order to decrease the presence of spores which are attached to their cuticle.<ref name=\"Hughes, D. P. 2011\"/> Studies also show that ants can sense that a member of the colony is infected; resulting in healthy ants carry the ''O. unilateralis''-infected individual far away from the colony to avoid fungal spore exposure.[4][5] Plus, there are reports testifying that most worker ants remain inside the nest boundaries, consequently, only foragers are at risk of infection.<ref name = \"Andersen2012\" /> \n\nMoreover, one of the fungus' principal hosts, ''Camponotus leonardi'' which occurs in tropical forests of Thailand, provided evidence for the avoidance of the forest floor by the host ants as a defence method.<ref name = \"Pontoppidan2009\"/> In areas where ''O. unilateralis'' is present, ''C. leonardi'' builds its nests high in the canopy, and has a broad network of areal trails. These trails occasionally move down to the ground level, where infection and graveyards occur, due to canopy gaps too difficult for the ants to cross. Studies show that when the trails descend to the forest floor, their length is only of three to five meters before going back up into the canopy. This demonstrates the avoidance of the zones of infection by the ants. Additionally, more evidence participates in the favour of this defence method being adaptive as it is not observed in undisturbed forests where the zombie-ant fungus is not present.<ref name = \"Pontoppidan2009\"/>\n\n== Genetic Basis of Behavioral Manipulation ==\n\nOphiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato is an Entomopathogenic fungi, meaning it is a parasite of insects. Parasites obtain their necessities of life by appropriating nutrients from a host, Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, are no exception to this concept of the nature of a parasite (1-5). One of the most notable traits of Ophiocordyceps unilateralis in the behavior it manipulates in the host ants to maximize their own lifetime reproductive fitness (2,4).  The Ophiocordyceps unilateralis is of great interest for many reasons, one of which is its ability to manipulate their hosts behaviors without destroying the brain (1,2,3).\nInfected ant hosts have been observed climbing up vegetation and biting onto it such tat they hang off the grass. It has been suggested that these hosts hang off of the vegetation in a position that is optimal for the fungi to have maximum dispersal (2,3). This behavior is known as an extended phenotype, otherwise described as the ability for a parasites genotype to be expressed in the hosts phenotype.\nIt was hypothesized that this fungus penetrates the brain (2), however, some experiments have found Ophiocordyceps unilateralis cells are present throughout the body, but not in the brain (3). Fungal cells have been identified as hyphal bodies which take the form of yeast-like cells and grow inside the ant\u2019s bodies. The other type of fungal cell is hyphae which are filamentous branch-like structure which allow for the fungus to spread to other tissues within the host (3). It has been found that the fungal cells never actually degrade or invade the brain of the host (1,3). \nTo better understand how exactly this fungus is able to invade and manipulate the ant hosts muscles, 3-dimensional (3D) structures of this parasite-host interaction were constructed (3). Experiments have shown that hyphae fungal cells surround the ants muscle fibers, especially in the legs (3). It has also been noted that these fungal cells interact with each other via conidial tubes. These tubes allow for the transfer of cellular information between the different muscle fibers which they surround and penetrate (3). Frederickson et al. found that these cell\u2013cell connections resulted in a 3D network of hyphal bodies that surrounded the muscle fiber as seen in the following figure (3).\n from Frederickson et al. \nSeveral studies have been done on entomopathogenic fungi to try and understand the genetic basis of this ability to alter their host\u2019s behaviors. Will et al. research used comparative transcriptomics (compared RNA sequences) between different entomopathogenic fungi-ant species interactions to see if there were any candidate genes which underly the manipulation of the ant\u2019s behavior (2). \n\n  from Will I et al.\nThe figure above shows the major genetic themes in infected host ants between various species of entomopathogenic fungi obtained from Will et al\u2019s comparative transcriptomics results and the associated behaviors of the hosts. Will et al. found that there were several recurring candidate genes found in infected hosts (5). Will et all\u2019s findings corroborate past literature by finding genetic basis of the extended phenotype. They saw changes in gene expression which modifies nutritional physiology and neuronal-activity. of the host (5).  One of the manipulations is to odor receptors where they observed regulation changes in odor receptor genes and binding proteins. Communication between ants relies on pheromone and odor detection, resulting in impaired response to external stimuli (5). is a disruption to the hosts innate circadian rhythms and caste identities  (1-5). There is still much to learn about the genetic basis of these relationships but understanding how a host is manipulated by these entomopathogenic fungi.\n\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|35em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Sample>{{cite news | first = Ian | last = Sample | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/aug/18/zombie-carpenter-ant-fungus | title = 'Zombie ants' controlled by parasitic fungus for 48m years | date = 18 August 2010 | department = News \u00bb Science \u00bb Microbiology | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=ponto>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pontoppidan MB, Himaman W, Hywel-Jones NL, Boomsma JJ, Hughes DP | title = Graveyards on the move: The spatio-temporal distribution of dead ''Ophiocordyceps''-infected ants | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = e4835 | date = 12 March 2009 | pmid = 19279680 | pmc = 2652714 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004835 | bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.4835P }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=sung>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sung GH, Hywel-Jones NL, Sung JM, Luangsa-Ard JJ, Shrestha B, Spatafora JW | title = Phylogenetic classification of ''Cordyceps'' and the clavicipitaceous fungi | journal = Studies in Mycology | volume = 57 | issue = 1 | pages = 5\u201359 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18490993 | pmc = 2104736 | doi = 10.3114/sim.2007.57.01 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Zombie>{{cite news | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100818105730.htm | title = Fossil Reveals 48-Million-Year History of Zombie Ants | publisher = [[Science Daily]] | date = 18 August 2010 | accessdate = 2010-09-12}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=MBank>{{cite web | url = http://www.mycobank.org/MycoTaxo.aspx?Link=T&Rec=281145 | title = Ophiocordyceps unilateralis | website = [[MycoBank]] | publisher = [[International Mycological Association]] | accessdate = 2011-07-19}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Hughes>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hughes DP, Wappler T, Labandeira CC | title = Ancient death-grip leaf scars reveal ant fungal parasitism | journal = [[Biology Letters]] | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 67\u201370 | date = 23 February 2011 | pmid = 20719770 | pmc = 3030878 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2010.0521 | origyear = 18 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Andersen>{{cite journal | vauthors = Andersen SB, Gerritsma S, Yusah KM, Mayntz D, Hywel-Jones NL, Billen J, Boomsma JJ, Hughes DP | title = The life of a dead ant: The expression of an adaptive extended phenotype | journal = [[The American Naturalist]] | volume = 174 | issue = 3 | pages = 424\u2013433 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19627240 | doi = 10.1086/603640 | jstor = 10.1086/603640 | url = https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/en/publications/the-life-of-a-dead-ant(e6374602-b2a0-496c-b78e-774b34fb152b).html }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Xiao>{{cite journal | vauthors = Xiao JH, Zhong JJ | title = Secondary metabolites from ''Cordyceps'' species and their antitumor activity studies | journal = Recent Patents on Biotechnology | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 123\u2013137 | year = 2007 | pmid = 19075836 | doi = 10.2174/187220807780809454 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Wongsa>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wongsa P, Tasanatai K, Watts P, Hywel-Jones N | title = Isolation and ''in vitro'' cultivation of the insect pathogenic fungus ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' | journal = [[Mycological Research]] | volume = 109 | issue = Pt 8 | pages = 936\u2013940 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16175796 | doi = 10.1017/S0953756205003321 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Unagul>{{cite journal | vauthors = Unagul P, Wongsa P, Kittakoop P, Intamas S, Srikitikulchai P, Tanticharoen M | title = Production of red pigments by the insect pathogenic fungus ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' BCC 1869 | journal = Journal of Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 135\u2013140 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15891934 | doi = 10.1007/s10295-005-0213-6 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Kittakoopa>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kittakoopa P, Punyaa J, Kongsaeree P, Lertwerawat Y, Jintasirikul A, Tanticharoena M, Thebtaranonth Y | year = 1999 | title = Bioactive naphthoquinones from ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' | journal = Phytochemistry | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 453\u2013457 | doi = 10.1016/S0031-9422(99)00272-1}}</ref>\n}}\n<ref> de Bekker, C., Ohm, R.

He joined [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] for \u00a3250,000 and managed to notch up 63 goals in 189 league matches until his departure to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 2002. Macken eventually made his first Premier League appearance for City. He only managed to score seven goals in 51 appearances during his three years with City but notably scored against United in the [[Manchester derby]] in 2004. He signed for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in 2005 and while there, moved to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] on loan. In 2007, he moved again to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] but was loaned out to [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] after failing to make an impact at [[Pride Park]] where he failed to score in 11 league appearances. He joined Barnsley permanently in 2008 and moved again to [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] two years later. He was released by The Saddlers at the end of the 2011\u201312 season and joined [[Northern Premier League]] side [[Northwich Victoria F.C.|Northwich Victoria]], before joining [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] briefly in 2013.\n\nHe has one international cap for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] which he earned in 2004 whilst a Manchester City player.\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Preston North End===\nMacken began his career at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and signed professional in 1996, but never played a first-team game for them and left on 22 July 1997 in a \u00a3250,000<ref name=LEP>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lep.co.uk/sport/football/the-big-interview-ex-pne-striker-jon-macken-1-5917688|title=THE BIG INTERVIEW: Ex-PNE striker Jon Macken|website=www.lep.co.uk}}</ref> move to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in 1997.\n\nHe scored over 70 goals at Preston, twice winning the [[Preston North End Player of the Year Award Winners|Player of the Year]] award. In 1999-2000, under [[David Moyes]], 25 goals from Macken saw Preston win the Second Division title.<ref name=LEP/>\n\n===Manchester City===\nFollowing this success, Macken moved into the [[Premier League]] with a transfer to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in February 2002, for a fee of \u00a35&nbsp;million.<ref name=LEP/> He is most remembered at City for scoring the winner in the 4-3 comeback win against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] in the [[2003\u201304 FA Cup]] on 4 February.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/3447235.stm|title=Tottenham 3\u20134 Man City|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=4 February 2004 |accessdate=14 August 2009}}</ref> However, he was severely hampered by a succession of injuries, and only made 27 league starts in over three years. This downturn in his career brought about a move away from Manchester and Macken joined [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in the summer of 2005 for \u00a31.1&nbsp;million.\n\n===Crystal Palace===\nInitially, Macken did not get into the Palace team, and was behind England international [[Andrew Johnson (English footballer)|Andrew Johnson]] and Republic of Ireland international [[Clinton Morrison]]. An injury to Johnson gave him a chance, initially, but then he himself got injured. His own replacement, [[Dougie Freedman]] showed good form, and despite a recovery from injury, Macken did not get back in the team.\n\nHowever, things turned upwards from there. Poor form by Morrison in the run-up to the Christmas period gave Macken his chance, and he scored his first competitive goal for Palace in the game at [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], on 14 October 2005 (he had previously scored in a pre-season friendly), and scored again on 26 December, at [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], although he was later sent off.\n\nMore injuries then continued to limit his chances, and the partnership with Johnson continued to alternate between Morrison and Dougie Freedman, with many fans voicing their discontent that Macken was not living up to his price-tag. Johnson was sold to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], prompting the return of [[S\u00e1ndor Torghelle]] to the club from his loan at [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]], creating speculation that Macken may be leaving the club, but the appointment of [[Peter John Taylor|Peter Taylor]] as manager appeared to silence this. Taylor, a known fan of Macken, had reportedly tried to sign him for [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull]], while he was in charge there.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fansfc.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225920/http://www.fansfc.com/frontpage/frontpagenews.asp?newsid=151339|url-status=dead|title=fansfc.com domain name is for sale.

On deadline-day of the Summer 2006 transfer window, he made a further move to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in [[Football League Championship|The Championship]], this time on loan, being handed the number 27 shirt.

He made his debut against the club that made his name, [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]]. He remained goalless for his first nine games, despite having produced a string of fine performances. On 22 December, he scored his first Barnsley goal against promotion chasing [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] after a fine run and shot.\n\nThe goals were flowing for Macken and he notched a brace against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] on 26 December. First a header from a [[Martin Devaney]] corner. His second goal came courtesy of a [[Kayode Odejayi]] knock-down from another Devaney cross. He then returned to Derby after [[Paul Jewell]] took over.\n\nHe made a couple of substitute appearances for the Rams but his inevitable return to Barnsley was secured on 28 January 2008 for \u00a3200,000.\n\nThe next day, he marked his return with a fine finish in the home game with [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]].

He joined [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] for \u00a3250,000 and managed to notch up 63 goals in 189 league matches until his departure to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 2002. Macken eventually made his first Premier League appearance for City. He only managed to score seven goals in 51 appearances during his three years with City but notably scored against United in the [[Manchester derby]] in 2004. He signed for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in 2005 and while there, moved to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] on loan. In 2007, he moved again to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] but was loaned out to [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] after failing to make an impact at [[Pride Park]] where he failed to score in 11 league appearances. He joined Barnsley permanently in 2008 and moved again to [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] two years later. He was released by The Saddlers at the end of the 2011\u201312 season and joined [[Northern Premier League]] side [[Northwich Victoria F.C.|Northwich Victoria]], before joining [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] briefly in 2013.\n\nHe has one international cap for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] which he earned in 2004 whilst a Manchester City player.\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Preston North End===\nMacken began his career at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and signed professional in 1996, but never played a first-team game for them and left on 22 July 1997 in a \u00a3250,000<ref name=LEP>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lep.co.uk/sport/football/the-big-interview-ex-pne-striker-jon-macken-1-5917688|title=THE BIG INTERVIEW: Ex-PNE striker Jon Macken|website=www.lep.co.uk}}</ref> move to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in 1997.\n\nHe scored over 70 goals at Preston, twice winning the [[Preston North End Player of the Year Award Winners|Player of the Year]] award. In 1999-2000, under [[David Moyes]], 25 goals from Macken saw Preston win the Second Division title.<ref name=LEP/>\n\n===Manchester City===\nFollowing this success, Macken moved into the [[Premier League]] with a transfer to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in February 2002, for a fee of \u00a35&nbsp;million.<ref name=LEP/> He is most remembered at City for scoring the winner in the 4-3 comeback win against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] in the [[2003\u201304 FA Cup]] on 4 February.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/3447235.stm|title=Tottenham 3\u20134 Man City|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=4 February 2004 |accessdate=14 August 2009}}</ref> However, he was severely hampered by a succession of injuries, and only made 27 league starts in over three years. This downturn in his career brought about a move away from Manchester and Macken joined [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in the summer of 2005 for \u00a31.1&nbsp;million.\n\n===Crystal Palace===\nInitially, Macken did not get into the Palace team, and was behind England international [[Andrew Johnson (English footballer)|Andrew Johnson]] and Republic of Ireland international [[Clinton Morrison]]. An injury to Johnson gave him a chance, initially, but then he himself got injured. His own replacement, [[Dougie Freedman]] showed good form, and despite a recovery from injury, Macken did not get back in the team.\n\nHowever, things turned upwards from there. Poor form by Morrison in the run-up to the Christmas period gave Macken his chance, and he scored his first competitive goal for Palace in the game at [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], on 14 October 2005 (he had previously scored in a pre-season friendly), and scored again on 26 December, at [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], although he was later sent off.\n\nMore injuries then continued to limit his chances, and the partnership with Johnson continued to alternate between Morrison and Dougie Freedman, with many fans voicing their discontent that Macken was not living up to his price-tag. Johnson was sold to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], prompting the return of [[S\u00e1ndor Torghelle]] to the club from his loan at [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]], creating speculation that Macken may be leaving the club, but the appointment of [[Peter John Taylor|Peter Taylor]] as manager appeared to silence this. Taylor, a known fan of Macken, had reportedly tried to sign him for [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull]], while he was in charge there.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fansfc.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225920/http://www.fansfc.com/frontpage/frontpagenews.asp?newsid=151339|url-status=dead|title=fansfc.com domain name is for sale.

He made his debut against the club that made his name, [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]]. He remained goalless for his first nine games, despite having produced a string of fine performances. On 22 December, he scored his first Barnsley goal against promotion chasing [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] after a fine run and shot.\n\nThe goals were flowing for Macken and he notched a brace against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] on 26 December. First a header from a [[Martin Devaney]] corner. His second goal came courtesy of a [[Kayode Odejayi]] knock-down from another Devaney cross. He then returned to Derby after [[Paul Jewell]] took over.\n\nHe made a couple of substitute appearances for the Rams but his inevitable return to Barnsley was secured on 28 January 2008 for \u00a3200,000.\n\nThe next day, he marked his return with a fine finish in the home game with [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]].
