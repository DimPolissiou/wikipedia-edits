The parents Andre and Bokkie Meintjies were jailed in 1994\u2013 (this was the year Mandela was elected as President of South Africa), and their children were placed in separate orphanages while the parents were jailed at correctional facilities very far from each other and the children to prevent family contact, because they educated their children at home. However, a few years later, the Mandela government legalised home education with the publication of the South African School Act in 1996. Since it was legalised, homeschooling has the fastest growing education model in the country.\n\nHomeschooling is legal according to [[South Africa]]n national law, but individual provinces have the authority to set their own restrictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hslda.org/hs/international/SouthAfrica/default.asp |title=Home Schooling - South Africa |publisher=HSLDA |date=2013-08-24 |accessdate=2016-04-03}}</ref> The SA Schools Act (art. 51) requires parents to register their children for education at home. In practice however, most provincial departments do not have the administrative capability to register children for home education. Some of the larger provincial departments have limited administrative capabilities to register children for home education as well as a lack of follow up capacity, resulting in a serious miscommunication between government and citizens. As a result of this situation, more than 90% of homeschooling parents do not register with the department.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuisskolers.org |title=SA Homeschoolers - Blog Articles |website=Tuisskolers.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}</ref>\nSince home education was legalised, it has grown exponentially.

Some provinces have implemented policies that require parents to notify school boards of their decision to homeschool.  Every province requires parents to notify the school system of their intent to withdraw their child from the public school system and to begin home education.  Five of ten provinces additionally require parents to submit a detailed curriculum to the state.  Seven of these provinces do not require the program to be monitored by the school board or other private school administrators, and only five provinces require routine inspection of home education.<ref name=\" Deani Neven Van Pelt 2015\">Deani Neven Van Pelt (2015). Home Schooling in Canada: The Current Picture\u20142015 Edition. Barbara Mitchell Centre for Improvement in Education. Fraser Institute.</ref> These policies, however, are not law; although Canadian legislators recognize the importance of state controls in the homeschooling environment, it is ultimately up to the parent to decide when and how to homeschool.  Despite a positive environment that supports and encourages alternatives to traditional schooling, it is estimated that less than 0.5% of Canadian families were homeschooling in 2015.

For those children whose parents decided to homeschool out of a desire to better education, a 2003 study found statistical significance between traditionally schooled and homeschooled students scores on standardized tests of writing, reading, and mathematics. A more recent 2011 study found that style of home education (structured versus unstructured) was a more important predictor of standardized test performance than other traditional measures, such as income and parents' educational attainment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.flora.org/homeschool-ca/faq.html#journalists|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980529151056/http://www.flora.org/homeschool-ca/faq.html#journalists|url-status=dead|archive-date=1998-05-29|title=Canadian Home Based Learning Resource Page|website=www.flora.org|access-date=2016-12-02}}</ref>  These findings are similar to findings in U.S. research on homeschooled children and the outcomes of homeschooling.\n\nOne technique that is specifically Canadian, specifically British Columbian, is the [[Distributed learning|Distributed Learning]] approach to home education.

So annual inspection is achieved first time at the age of 3. Probably from september 2020 compulsory education will rise to age of 18.\n\nEvery other two years, the social welfare, mandated by the mayor, verifies the reasons the family home educates and controls that the training provided is consistent with the health of the child. Parents will also be subject to annual inspections if they are teaching children between the ages of 6 and 16. Two consecutive unsatisfactory outcomes of these inspections can mean the parents will have to send their children to a mainstream school.\n\nWhile homeschooling parents are free to teach their children in any way they like, the children must remain every year at a skill level that complies with high probability to master the seven key competencies of the common foundation of competence at the end of the legal obligation (age 16).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.education.gouv.fr/file/3/46/0/instruction_famille_204460.pdf |format=PDF |title=B.O.

Many states developed school systems before and with the rise of the [[Weimar Republic]] some reforms were proposed. In the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]], homeschooling was seen as an anti-nationalistic and subversive practice that could undermine children's loyalty to their country. The Reichsschulpflichtgesetz, implemented in 1938, effectively banned all homeschooling with criminal consequences for anyone found practicing. This is one of the few Nazi laws that is followed in present-day Germany.\n\nIn 1989, Helmut St\u00fccher removed his children from the public school system to begin homeschooling.

The parents Andre and Bokkie Meintjies were jailed in 1994\u2013 (this was the year Mandela was elected as President of South Africa), and their children were placed in separate orphanages while the parents were jailed at correctional facilities very far from each other and the children to prevent family contact, because they educated their children at home. However, a few years later, the Mandela government legalised home education with the publication of the South African School Act in 1996. Since it was legalised, homeschooling has the fastest growing education model in the country.\n\nHomeschooling is legal according to [[South Africa]]n national law, but individual provinces have the authority to set their own restrictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hslda.org/hs/international/SouthAfrica/default.asp |title=Home Schooling - South Africa |publisher=HSLDA |date=2013-08-24 |accessdate=2016-04-03}}</ref> The SA Schools Act (art. 51) requires parents to register their children for education at home. In practice however, most provincial departments do not have the administrative capability to register children for home education. Some of the larger provincial departments have limited administrative capabilities to register children for home education as well as a lack of follow up capacity, resulting in a serious miscommunication between government and citizens. As a result of this situation, more than 90% of homeschooling parents do not register with the department.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuisskolers.org |title=SA Homeschoolers - Blog Articles |website=Tuisskolers.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}</ref>\nSince home education was legalised, it has grown exponentially.

Five of ten provinces additionally require parents to submit a detailed curriculum to the state.  Seven of these provinces do not require the program to be monitored by the school board or other private school administrators, and only five provinces require routine inspection of home education.<ref name=\" Deani Neven Van Pelt 2015\">Deani Neven Van Pelt (2015).

The child is required to enroll into a local school (public or private) and pass an annual exam in certain subjects (mother tongue and math only in lower grades; with addition of foreign language in middle grades and more subjects in higher grades). If the child does not pass all the exams in two attempts, it is ordered to continue the education with regular school attendance. Every year the parents have to notify the school by the end of May that they will be educating their child at home.\n\nLike in the case of [[#Slovenia|Slovenia]] and [[#Montenegro|Montenegro]], the proposed model does not impose any limitation on who can home educate.<ref>[http://www.druginacin.hr/clanci/sluzbeno-ocitovanje-mzos-a-o-legalizaciji-obrazovanja-kod-kuce/ \"Slu\u017ebeno o\u010ditovanje MZO\u0160-a o legalizaciji obrazovanja kod ku\u0107e\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706092956/http://www.druginacin.hr/clanci/sluzbeno-ocitovanje-mzos-a-o-legalizaciji-obrazovanja-kod-kuce/ |date=2011-07-06 }} (hr), druginacin.hr</ref> The parents educating their children at home are ''not'' eligible to receive any kind of state help. The schools are free to choose whether they will allow special arrangements with children educated at home (flexi-schooling, the use of school resources, participation in field trips and other school activities, etc.). The Ministry of Education and schools are ''not'' required to provide any form of help to parents of children educated at home (teacher guides, worksheets, consultation, etc.).\n\nThe proposed model was chosen as it requires minimal change to the existing law and would be possible to implement within the current educational framework. The Croatian Constitution,<ref>[http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/232289.html Ustav Republike Hrvatske] (hr), Croatian Constitution, 25 April 2001, Article 63 paragraph 1 and Article 65 paragraph 1</ref> in the Article 63 paragraph 1, states that parents have a duty to ''school'' their children. Similarly, in the Article 65 paragraph 1, it states that primary ''schooling'' is compulsory and free. It is deeply ingrained in Croatian culture that education cannot happen without schooling.\n\nAs of July 2011 there are three alternative primary schools in Croatia \u2013 one Montessori<ref>[http://www.montessori-skola.hr/ Osnovna Montessori \u0161kola \"Barunice D\u00e9d\u00e9e Vranyczany\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901211704/http://www.montessori-skola.hr/ |date=2011-09-01 }} (hr), Zagreb</ref> and two Steiner Waldorf schools.<ref>[http://www.waldorfska-skola.com/ Waldorfska \u0161kola u Zagrebu] (hr), Zagreb</ref><ref>[http://www.waldorf-rijeka.hr/ Osnovna waldorfska \u0161kola u Rijeci] (hr), Rijeka</ref> Alternative schools in Croatia are required to follow national curriculum<ref name=hr-zakon-skola /> (Article 26 paragraph 1, Article 30).\n\n==== Czech Republic ====\n: ''Status: '''Legal'''''\nThe Ministry of Education began an experiment on September 1, 1998 in which home education was made a legal alternative for students in the first five years of elementary school. In 2004 home education, referred to as Individual Education, was enshrined in the Education Act for children within that age group.

So annual inspection is achieved first time at the age of 3. Probably from september 2020 compulsory education will rise to age of 18.\n\nEvery other two years, the social welfare, mandated by the mayor, verifies the reasons the family home educates and controls that the training provided is consistent with the health of the child. Parents will also be subject to annual inspections if they are teaching children between the ages of 6 and 16. Two consecutive unsatisfactory outcomes of these inspections can mean the parents will have to send their children to a mainstream school.\n\nWhile homeschooling parents are free to teach their children in any way they like, the children must remain every year at a skill level that complies with high probability to master the seven key competencies of the common foundation of competence at the end of the legal obligation (age 16).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.education.gouv.fr/file/3/46/0/instruction_famille_204460.pdf |format=PDF |title=B.O.

Many states developed school systems before and with the rise of the [[Weimar Republic]] some reforms were proposed. In the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]], homeschooling was seen as an anti-nationalistic and subversive practice that could undermine children's loyalty to their country. The Reichsschulpflichtgesetz, implemented in 1938, effectively banned all homeschooling with criminal consequences for anyone found practicing. This is one of the few Nazi laws that is followed in present-day Germany.\n\nIn 1989, Helmut St\u00fccher removed his children from the public school system to begin homeschooling. St\u00fccher and others who followed suit were fined, and some even lost child custody.<ref>J.D., 2010. HOMESCHOOLING IN GERMANY AND THE UNITED STATES. James E.

The European Court took the position that the plaintiffs were the children, not their parents, and declared \"children are unable to foresee the consequences of their parents' decision for home education because of their young age....

He mooted this idea while enjoying the fresh and crisp air from the balcony of his hotel room.\nA private company called Genting Highlands Berhad was set up on 27 April 1965, with the late [[Mohamad Noah Omar|Tan Sri Haji Mohammed Noah bin Omar]], Tan Sri Lim successfully obtained approval for the alienation of {{convert|12,000|acre}} and {{convert|2,800|acre}} of land from the Pahang and Selangor State Government respectively between the years 1965 and 1970. An anomaly happened during the obtaining of the land approvals. While the Pahang state government swiftly approved a freehold lease, the [[Selangor]] state reluctantly approved a 99-year lease. As a result, Tan Sri Lim Goh Tong met the then [[Menteri Besar]] of Selangor, Dato Harun Idris and told him that a freehold lease would be more feasible than a 99-year lease. Finally, the Selangor state government agreed to grant a freehold lease.\n\nOn 18 August 1965, a technical and construction team began the four-year task to complete the [[Genting Sempah-Genting Highlands Highway|access road]] from Genting Sempah to the peak of Gunung Ulu Kali.\nOn 31 March 1969, the late YTM [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], Malaysia's first prime minister, laid the foundation stone for the company's pioneer hotel, marking the completion of the access road to Genting Highlands Resort. The Prime Minister was impressed that the private sector, without the assistance of the Government, could develop a mountain resort for the enjoyment of all Malaysians{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}; subsequently a gaming licence was suggested to help accelerate the development of this remote area.\n\nIn 1971, the first hotel at Genting Highlands was completed and was named Highlands Hotel (now renamed as Theme Park Hotel).\nThe Genting Highlands Resort continued to expand since the opening of the first hotel in 1971. Development of the area continued with care taken to ensure the maintenance of the natural beauty of the rainforest of the region.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\nIn 1997, Genting Highlands Resort added the [[Genting Skyway]] cable car system that provides a {{convert|3.38|km}} transport to the hilltop. Genting Skyway is also recognised as the \"World's Fastest Mono Cable Car System\" with a maximum speed of {{convert|21.6|km/h}} and the \"Longest Cable Car in Malaysia and probably in Southeast Asia\".{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nIn 2013, Genting Malaysia embarked on a master plan to reinvigorate and transform RWG under the Genting Integrated Tourism Plan (GITP). Genting Integrated Tourism Plan is a 10-year master plan for development, expansion, enhancement and refurbishment of hotels, theme parks and infrastructure at Resorts World Genting. The plan with different phases involves a new 1,300 rooms hotel expansion to the current [[First World Hotel]], a new 10,000 seats arena and reconverting the Genting Outdoor Theme Park to [[20th Century Fox World (Malaysia)|20th Century Fox World]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/908180|title=RM5b to transform Resorts World Genting|website=[[thesundaily.my]]|date=December 18, 2013|accessdate= March 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nGenting Highlands has a spring-like climate, with yearly temperatures no higher than {{convert|25|\u00b0C}} and rarely falling below {{convert|10|\u00b0C}} yearly.

{{IPAc-en|g|\u0259|n|\u02c8|t|i\u02d0|\u014b}}, originally known as Genting Highlands Resort is an [[integrated resort|integrated hill resort]] development comprising hotels, shopping malls, theme parks and casinos, perched on the peak of Mount Ulu Kali at 1,800 meters high near the border between the states of [[Pahang]] and [[Selangor]], [[Malaysia]].\n\nThe integrated hill resort is accessible by car  within an hour drive from [[Kuala Lumpur]] (about 35 km), or accessible by two different cable cars, [[Genting Skyway]] which at its opening was the world's fastest and South East Asia's longest gondola lift, and the newer [[Awana Skyway]].\n\n==History==\nThe idea of a hill resort located near [[Kuala Lumpur]] occurred to Tan Sri [[Lim Goh Tong]] during a business trip to the [[Cameron Highlands]] in 1964. He mooted this idea while enjoying the fresh and crisp air from the balcony of his hotel room.\nA private company called Genting Highlands Berhad was set up on 27 April 1965, with the late [[Mohamad Noah Omar|Tan Sri Haji Mohammed Noah bin Omar]], Tan Sri Lim successfully obtained approval for the alienation of {{convert|12,000|acre}} and {{convert|2,800|acre}} of land from the Pahang and Selangor State Government respectively between the years 1965 and 1970. An anomaly happened during the obtaining of the land approvals. While the Pahang state government swiftly approved a freehold lease, the [[Selangor]] state reluctantly approved a 99-year lease. As a result, Tan Sri Lim Goh Tong met the then [[Menteri Besar]] of Selangor, Dato Harun Idris and told him that a freehold lease would be more feasible than a 99-year lease. Finally, the Selangor state government agreed to grant a freehold lease.\n\nOn 18 August 1965, a technical and construction team began the four-year task to complete the [[Genting Sempah-Genting Highlands Highway|access road]] from Genting Sempah to the peak of Gunung Ulu Kali.\nOn 31 March 1969, the late YTM [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], Malaysia's first prime minister, laid the foundation stone for the company's pioneer hotel, marking the completion of the access road to Genting Highlands Resort. The Prime Minister was impressed that the private sector, without the assistance of the Government, could develop a mountain resort for the enjoyment of all Malaysians{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}; subsequently a gaming licence was suggested to help accelerate the development of this remote area.\n\nIn 1971, the first hotel at Genting Highlands was completed and was named Highlands Hotel (now renamed as Theme Park Hotel).\nThe Genting Highlands Resort continued to expand since the opening of the first hotel in 1971. Development of the area continued with care taken to ensure the maintenance of the natural beauty of the rainforest of the region.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\nIn 1997, Genting Highlands Resort added the [[Genting Skyway]] cable car system that provides a {{convert|3.38|km}} transport to the hilltop. Genting Skyway is also recognised as the \"World's Fastest Mono Cable Car System\" with a maximum speed of {{convert|21.6|km/h}} and the \"Longest Cable Car in Malaysia and probably in Southeast Asia\".{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nIn 2013, Genting Malaysia embarked on a master plan to reinvigorate and transform RWG under the Genting Integrated Tourism Plan (GITP). Genting Integrated Tourism Plan is a 10-year master plan for development, expansion, enhancement and refurbishment of hotels, theme parks and infrastructure at Resorts World Genting. The plan with different phases involves a new 1,300 rooms hotel expansion to the current [[First World Hotel]], a new 10,000 seats arena and reconverting the Genting Outdoor Theme Park to [[20th Century Fox World (Malaysia)|20th Century Fox World]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/908180|title=RM5b to transform Resorts World Genting|website=[[thesundaily.my]]|date=December 18, 2013|accessdate= March 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nGenting Highlands has a spring-like climate, with yearly temperatures no higher than {{convert|25|\u00b0C}} and rarely falling below {{convert|10|\u00b0C}} yearly. The lowest temperature of Genting Highlands is {{convert|8.4|\u00b0C}}.

His parents were Dr. Wilhelm Klemperer, a [[rabbi]], and Henriette n\u00e9e Frankel. Victor had three brothers and four sisters:\n* Georg, 1865\u20131946, physician, director of the hospital Berlin-[[Moabit]] (who treated [[Vladimir Lenin]])\n* Felix, 1866\u20131932, physician, director of the hospital Berlin-Reinickendorf\n* Margarete (Grete), 1867\u20131942, married Riesenfeld\n* Hedwig, 1870\u20131893, married Machol\n* Berthold, 1871\u20131931, lawyer\n* Marta, 1873\u20131954, married Jelski\n* Valeska (Wally), 1877\u20131936, married Sussmann\nVictor was a cousin to the conductor [[Otto Klemperer]], and first cousin once removed to Otto's son, the actor [[Werner Klemperer]]. In 1903 Klemperer converted to Protestantism for the first time, shortly thereafter returning to Judaism.\n\nVictor Klemperer attended several [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasia]].

In the diary, the much-feared Gestapo is seen carrying out daily, humiliating, and brutal house searches, delivering beatings, hurling insults, and robbing inhabitants of coveted foodstuffs and other household items. In addition, the diary relates the profound uncertainty all Germans\u2014Jews and non-Jews\u2014experienced because of the paucity of reliable information about the war's progress, largely due to the propaganda so central to the Reich's conduct of the war and of the [[Final Solution]]. Klemperer and his fellow Jews became aware only gradually of the nature of atrocities and scale of \"extermination\" at camps such as Theresienstadt and Auschwitz, even as they watched friends and neighbors deported and their risk of deportation mounted.<ref name=MacMillan>[[Margaret MacMillan]]. 2015.

On the following three nights the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Allies heavily bombed Dresden]] for the first time, causing massive damage and a [[firestorm]]; during the chaos that followed, Klemperer removed his [[Yellow badge|yellow star]] (punishable by death if discovered) on 19 February, joined a refugee column, and escaped into American-controlled territory.

He was a delegate of the [[Cultural Association of the GDR]] in the GDR's Parliament (''[[Volkskammer]]'') from 1950 to 1958, and frequently mentions in his later diary his frustration at its lack of power and its largely ceremonial role.\n\nKlemperer's diary was published in 1995 as ''Tageb\u00fccher'' (Berlin, [[Aufbau-Verlag|Aufbau]]). It was an immediate literary sensation and rapidly became a bestseller in Germany. An [[English language|English]] translation of the years spanning the Nazi seizure of power through Klemperer's death has appeared in three volumes: ''I Will Bear Witness'' (1933 to 1941), ''To The Bitter End'' (1942 to 1945) and ''The Lesser Evil'' (1945 to 1959).\n\nIn 1995, Victor Klemperer was posthumously awarded the [[Geschwister-Scholl-Preis]] for his work, ''Ich will Zeugnis ablegen bis zum letzten.

In the diary, the much-feared Gestapo is seen carrying out daily, humiliating, and brutal house searches, delivering beatings, hurling insults, and robbing inhabitants of coveted foodstuffs and other household items. In addition, the diary relates the profound uncertainty all Germans\u2014Jews and non-Jews\u2014experienced because of the paucity of reliable information about the war's progress, largely due to the propaganda so central to the Reich's conduct of the war and of the [[Final Solution]]. Klemperer and his fellow Jews became aware only gradually of the nature of atrocities and scale of \"extermination\" at camps such as Theresienstadt and Auschwitz, even as they watched friends and neighbors deported and their risk of deportation mounted.<ref name=MacMillan>[[Margaret MacMillan]]. 2015.

On the following three nights the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Allies heavily bombed Dresden]] for the first time, causing massive damage and a [[firestorm]]; during the chaos that followed, Klemperer removed his [[Yellow badge|yellow star]] (punishable by death if discovered) on 19 February, joined a refugee column, and escaped into American-controlled territory. He and his wife survived, and Klemperer's diary narrates their return, largely on foot through [[Bavaria]] and Eastern Germany, to their house in [[D\u00f6lzschen]], on the outskirts of [[Dresden]].<ref name=Klemperer>Victor Klemperer. 1999.  pp. 507, 574, 629</ref> They managed to reclaim the house, which the Nazis had \"[[Aryanization (Nazism)|aryanised]]\".\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Bundesarchiv Bild 183-16662-0024, Victor Klemperer erh\u00e4lt Nationalpreis.jpg\n| width1    = 212\n| caption1  = Victor Klemperer receiving a [[East Germany|DDR]] National Prize in 1952\n| image2    = Victor Klemperer 2.JPG\n| width2    = 218\n| caption2  = The grave of Victor and Eva Klemperer in Dresden\n}}\n\n==Post-war==\nAfter the war, Klemperer joined the communist [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]], and recovered a university post at the University of Leipzig. His former friend, historian Johannes K\u00fchn, who had severed connections with Klemperer upon his dismissal from the University of Dresden, welcomed him back as if nothing had happened.<ref>Omer Bartov. 2003.

He was a delegate of the [[Cultural Association of the GDR]] in the GDR's Parliament (''[[Volkskammer]]'') from 1950 to 1958, and frequently mentions in his later diary his frustration at its lack of power and its largely ceremonial role.\n\nKlemperer's diary was published in 1995 as ''Tageb\u00fccher'' (Berlin, [[Aufbau-Verlag|Aufbau]]). It was an immediate literary sensation and rapidly became a bestseller in Germany. An [[English language|English]] translation of the years spanning the Nazi seizure of power through Klemperer's death has appeared in three volumes: ''I Will Bear Witness'' (1933 to 1941), ''To The Bitter End'' (1942 to 1945) and ''The Lesser Evil'' (1945 to 1959).\n\nIn 1995, Victor Klemperer was posthumously awarded the [[Geschwister-Scholl-Preis]] for his work, ''Ich will Zeugnis ablegen bis zum letzten.
