It was the first single off his fourth album, ''[[Wanted (Bow Wow album)|Wanted]]'' (2005). Released on March 11, 2005, the song features American [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer [[Omarion]] (the first collaboration they did together). It was [[Composer|co-written]] and [[Music producer|co-produced]] by frequent producer [[Jermaine Dupri]] and [[No I.D.]] and uses a sample of [[Luther Vandross]]' 1985 version of [[Brenda Russell]]'s \"[[If Only for One Night]]\".\n\nThe song received positive reviews from critics. \"Let Me Hold You\" peaked at number four on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], making this the first top 10 hit for both Bow Wow and for Omarion as a solo artist. It also became a number-one hit for both artists on the [[Hot Rap Songs]] chart and stayed there for seven weeks. The song also peaked at numbers 2 and 10 on both the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] and [[Mainstream Top 40]] charts respectively, and reached the top 40 in countries like Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and the UK. The song was [[RIAA certification|certified Platinum]] by the [[RIAA]] for selling over 1,000,000 copies. A music video, directed by [[Bryan Barber]], was made to promote the single and featured Bow Wow and Omarion hanging out at a house party.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Omarion_LF.JPG|thumb|left|160px|Co-producer Jermaine Dupri was the one who suggested to Bow Wow that he should record the song with [[Omarion]] (pictured).]]\nBow Wow had publicly announced his interpretation of the song's meaning as he stated in an interview with [[MTV]]: <blockquote>\"Basically the song is me talking to a girl and telling her, 'These are the things I can do for you. Let me hold you down. This is what I want to do for you as a man. These are the things I'm capable of doing for you if you get with me. Just hear me out.' I'm just really talking to the ladies.

It was [[Composer|co-written]] and [[Music producer|co-produced]] by frequent producer [[Jermaine Dupri]] and [[No I.D.]] and uses a sample of [[Luther Vandross]]' 1985 version of [[Brenda Russell]]'s \"[[If Only for One Night]]\".\n\nThe song received positive reviews from critics. \"Let Me Hold You\" peaked at number four on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], making this the first top 10 hit for both Bow Wow and for Omarion as a solo artist.

Let me hold you down. This is what I want to do for you as a man. These are the things I'm capable of doing for you if you get with me. Just hear me out.' I'm just really talking to the ladies.
