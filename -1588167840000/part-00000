Their most emblematic mark of distinction is a blue beret. VDV soldiers are often called \"blue berets\". Each year, current and former paratroopers, often in an inebriated state, celebrate by meeting up and wandering city streets and parks. The day is notorious for two common sights: paratroopers frolicking in fountains and picking fights with hapless passers-by.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/mayor-of-northern-russian-city-breaks-promise-rejects-request-for-gay-parade/526157.html|title=Mayor of Northern Russian City Breaks Promise, Rejects Request for Gay Parade \u2013 News|work=The Moscow Times|access-date=2015-07-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725175057/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/mayor-of-northern-russian-city-breaks-promise-rejects-request-for-gay-parade/526157.html|archive-date=2015-07-25|url-status=live}}</ref>\n[[File:Vladimir Putin 2 August 2000-1.jpg|thumb| 200px| [[President of Russia|President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] at a ceremony unveiling a memorial erected to paratroopers of the 6th Company, 76th Air Assault Division]]Notable former Airborne Forces officers include [[Alexander Lebed|Aleksandr Lebed]], who was involved in responses to disorder in the Caucasus republics in the last years of the [[Soviet Union]], and [[Pavel Grachev]] who went on to become the first [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Minister of Defence]] of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]].

series, BTR series, and MT-LB, the VDV uses exclusively BMD family vehicles. There are over 1,800 armored fighting vehicles, mostly [[BMD-1]] (since 1969) and [[BMD-2]] (since 1985). There were also over 100 [[BMD-3]] (1990) that were partially upgraded to [[BMD-4]] level. All of them are amphibious, moving at around 10&nbsp;km/h in water. The BMD-4 is also capable of full, continuous fire while in deep water, unlike any other vehicle with such heavy weaponry (100&nbsp;mm gun and 30&nbsp;mm auto cannon).  However, some units (such as those who served on peacekeeping duties in the Balkans) are known to have used BTR armored personnel carriers rather than BMD's. T-72B3 tanks supplied to the Russian Airborne Forces in 2018 have been upgraded and are equipped with Andromeda automatic control system.<ref>https://armyrecognition.com/weapons_defence_industry_military_technology_uk/russian_t-72b3_tanks_integrated_into_andromeda_automatic_control.html</ref>\n\nThere is also a turret-less variant of the BMD-1, the [[BTR-D]], which is used as troop carrier and serves as the basis for specialised versions such as anti-tank, command and signals. The BTR-D will be partially replaced by the new multi-purpose APC [[BMD-3|BTR-MD \"Rakushka\"]] that will also come in several different versions. Approximately 280 vehicles in all BTR-D configurations are in service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://warfare.be/db/catid/245/linkid/2312/title/btr-d-/rd/-zd/|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131024125732/http://warfare.be/db/catid/245/linkid/2312/title/btr-d-/rd/-zd/|title=BTR-D /RD/ ZD|archivedate=24 October 2013|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2014}}</ref> As part of the 2011 state defence order (GOZ), 10 [[BMD-4]]M and 10 \"Rakushka's\" have been ordered, but according to the VDV's CinC General Colonel Shamanov, Kurganmashzavod did not give a guarantee it would produce them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://russiandefpolicy.wordpress.com/2011/05/31/shamanov-on-the-vdvs-goz/|title=Shamanov on the VDV's GOZ \u2013 Russian Defense Policy|work=Russian Defense Policy|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019083204/http://russiandefpolicy.wordpress.com/2011/05/31/shamanov-on-the-vdvs-goz/|archive-date=19 October 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Russian Defense Ministry adopted the BMD-4M in early December 2012.

It later became the 10th Independent Peacekeeping Airborne Regiment. The unit was further designated the 50th Military Base.\n\nIn the early 1990s, General [[Pavel Grachev]], the first Russian Defence Minister, planned for the VDV to form the core of the planned Mobile Forces. This was announced in [[Krasnaya Zvezda|''Krasnaya Zvezda'']], the [[Russian Ministry of Defence|Ministry of Defence]]'s daily newspaper, in July 1992. However, the Mobile Forces plan never eventuated. The number of formations available for the force was far less than anticipated, since much of the Airborne Forces had been 'nationalised' by the republics their units had been previously based in, and other arms of service, such as the GRU and [[Military Transport Aviation]], who were to provide the airlift component, were adamantly opposed to ceding control of their forces.<ref>[[Baev, Pavel]], ''The Russian Army in a Time of Troubles'', International Peace Research Institute, Oslo, 1996, pp. 127\u2013135</ref>\n\nFrom 1996 the VDV dispatched the [[1st Separate Airborne Brigade]] to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] as part of [[Implementation Force|IFOR]]'s [[Multi-National Division (North) (Bosnia)|Multi-National Division North]]. The brigade, unusually, used [[Russian Ground Forces]] equipment such as [[BTR-80]]s.\n\nAfter an experimental period, the 104th Parachute Regiment of 76th Airborne Division became the first Russian Ground Forces regiment that was fully composed of professional soldiers (and not of ''srochniki'' \u2013 conscripted soldiers aged eighteen). It was announced that the 98th Airborne Division is also earmarked for contract manning, and by September 2006, it was confirmed that 95% of the units of the 98th Division had shifted to contract manning.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-20602902_ITM|title=Interfax Russia & CIS Military Weekly|date=15 September 2006|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927191538/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-20602902_ITM|archivedate=September 27, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:vdv.gif|thumb|150px|left|Older sleeve ensign version of a Russian Airborne field uniform]]\nThe VDV divisions are equipped with armoured fighting vehicles, artillery and anti-aircraft guns, trucks and jeeps.{{citation needed|date=June 2008}} Thus VDV units possess superior mobility and firepower with these vehicles.

They also were deployed in [[Chechnya]] as an active bridgehead for other forces to follow.\n\nRussian airborne troops had their own holiday during the Soviet era, which continues to be celebrated on 2 August. Their most emblematic mark of distinction is a blue beret. VDV soldiers are often called \"blue berets\". Each year, current and former paratroopers, often in an inebriated state, celebrate by meeting up and wandering city streets and parks.

series, BTR series, and MT-LB, the VDV uses exclusively BMD family vehicles. There are over 1,800 armored fighting vehicles, mostly [[BMD-1]] (since 1969) and [[BMD-2]] (since 1985). There were also over 100 [[BMD-3]] (1990) that were partially upgraded to [[BMD-4]] level. All of them are amphibious, moving at around 10&nbsp;km/h in water. The BMD-4 is also capable of full, continuous fire while in deep water, unlike any other vehicle with such heavy weaponry (100&nbsp;mm gun and 30&nbsp;mm auto cannon).  However, some units (such as those who served on peacekeeping duties in the Balkans) are known to have used BTR armored personnel carriers rather than BMD's. T-72B3 tanks supplied to the Russian Airborne Forces in 2018 have been upgraded and are equipped with Andromeda automatic control system.<ref>https://armyrecognition.com/weapons_defence_industry_military_technology_uk/russian_t-72b3_tanks_integrated_into_andromeda_automatic_control.html</ref>\n\nThere is also a turret-less variant of the BMD-1, the [[BTR-D]], which is used as troop carrier and serves as the basis for specialised versions such as anti-tank, command and signals. The BTR-D will be partially replaced by the new multi-purpose APC [[BMD-3|BTR-MD \"Rakushka\"]] that will also come in several different versions. Approximately 280 vehicles in all BTR-D configurations are in service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://warfare.be/db/catid/245/linkid/2312/title/btr-d-/rd/-zd/|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131024125732/http://warfare.be/db/catid/245/linkid/2312/title/btr-d-/rd/-zd/|title=BTR-D /RD/ ZD|archivedate=24 October 2013|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2014}}</ref> As part of the 2011 state defence order (GOZ), 10 [[BMD-4]]M and 10 \"Rakushka's\" have been ordered, but according to the VDV's CinC General Colonel Shamanov, Kurganmashzavod did not give a guarantee it would produce them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://russiandefpolicy.wordpress.com/2011/05/31/shamanov-on-the-vdvs-goz/|title=Shamanov on the VDV's GOZ \u2013 Russian Defense Policy|work=Russian Defense Policy|accessdate=24 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019083204/http://russiandefpolicy.wordpress.com/2011/05/31/shamanov-on-the-vdvs-goz/|archive-date=19 October 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Russian Defense Ministry adopted the BMD-4M in early December 2012.

This phenomenon of cooling the Earth's surface by emissions occurs naturally in the world by the eruption of volcanoes.

Unlike a carbon trading system that would be focused on participation from multiple parties along with transparency, monitoring measures and compliance procedures; this is not necessarily required by climate engineering. Bengtsson<ref>Bengtsson, L. (2006) 'Geo-engineering to confine climate change: is it at all feasible?' Climatic Change 77: 229\u2013234</ref> (2006) argues that \"the artificial release of sulphate aerosols is a commitment of at least several hundred years\". Yet this is true only if a long-term deployment strategy is adopted. Under a short-term, temporary strategy, implementation would instead be limited to decades.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/nclimate2493| title=A temporary, moderate and responsive scenario for solar geoengineering| journal=Nature Climate Change| volume=5| issue=3| pages=201\u2013206| year=2015| last1=Keith| first1=David W.| last2=MacMartin| first2=Douglas G.|url = https://authors.library.caltech.edu/56537/2/nclimate2493-s1.pdf| bibcode=2015NatCC...5..201K}}</ref> Both cases, however, highlight the importance for a political framework that is sustainable enough to contain a multilateral commitment over such a long period and yet is flexible as the techniques innovate through time. There are many controversies surrounding this topic and hence, climate engineering has become a very political issue. Most discussions and debates are not about which climate engineering technique is better than the other, or which one is more economically and socially feasible. Discussions are broadly on who will have control over the deployment of climate engineering and under what governance regime the deployment can be monitored and supervised. This is especially important due to the regional variability of the effects of many climate engineering techniques, benefiting some countries while damaging others. The main challenge posed by climate engineering is not how to get countries to do it. It is to address the fundamental question of who should decide whether and how climate engineering should be attempted \u2013 a problem of governance.<ref>Barrett, S (2007) Why cooperate?

Although no action has been carried out for spraying these gases and clouds into the atmosphere, this discovery could have a major influence on the course of action humans choose to take for reducing the greenhouse gas effect.\n\nMany critics and concerned scientists are whole-heartedly against the idea of solar geoengineering. A geophysics professor, Alan Robock, has reprimanded the Nature Climate Change journal for neglecting to mention other environmental effects that will occur from the atmospheric spray. Robock had said the choice to cool the Earth by artificial emissions would be very costly and it could serve a potential threat to different plant and animal species. Likewise, The Nature Ecology and Evolution journal predicted the use of aerosols would cause a quick transfer of temperatures from warm to cold which would not allow animals to move to a comfortable environment. Ultimately, it would cause a massive extinction of various animal and plant species.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/11/solar-geoengineering-climate-change-new-study|title=Radical plan to artificially cool Earth's climate could be safe, study finds|last=Holden|first=Emily|date=11 March 2019|website=The Guardian|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120402075822/http://www.irgc.org/-Granger-Morgan-.html Granger Morgan], Katharine Ricke (2010).

As early as 1974, Russian expert [[Mikhail Budyko]] suggested that if global warming became a problem, we could cool down the planet by burning sulfur in the stratosphere, which would create a haze. The annual cost of delivering a sufficient amount of sulfur to counteract expected greenhouse warming is estimated at  to $8 billion US dollars.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McClellan|first1=Justin|last2=Keith|first2=David W.|last3=Apt|first3=Jay|title=Cost analysis of stratospheric albedo modification delivery systems|issue=3|journal=Environmental Research Letters|volume=7|pages=034019|language=en|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/7/3/034019|date=1 January 2012|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nScientists are postulating various ways in which mankind can hinder the detrimental effects of climate change and the warming of the planet. Researchers have proposed that increasing the Earth's albedo, or the reflectivity of the Sun's infrared rays, by spraying aerosols such as sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere could help eliminate the greenhouse gas effect. This phenomenon of cooling the Earth's surface by emissions occurs naturally in the world by the eruption of volcanoes. Some scientists believe that artificially producing the same emissions of volcanoes could mitigate the warming of the planet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/22/16920078/geoengineering-stratospheric-aerosol-injection-climate-change-biodiversity-global-warming|title=If we start deliberately cooling the Earth, we may not be able to stop|last=Chen|first=Angela|date=22 January 2018|website=The Verge|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA preliminary study by [[Edward Teller]] and others in 1997 presented the pros and cons of various relatively \"low-tech\" proposals to mitigate global warming through scattering/reflecting sunlight away from the Earth via insertion of various materials in the upper stratosphere, low earth orbit, and {{L1}} locations.<ref name=\"Teller1997\">{{Cite journal |author=Edward Teller |author2=Roderick Hyde |author3=Lowell Wood |title=Global Warming and Ice Ages: Prospects for Physics-Based Modulation of Global Change |year=1997 |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |url=https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/231636.pdf |accessdate=21 January 2015 |postscript=.

A third potentially viable option, currently under development but not yet widely deployed, is [[carbon dioxide removal]] (CDR) from the atmosphere accompanied by reliable sequestration.

Unlike a carbon trading system that would be focused on participation from multiple parties along with transparency, monitoring measures and compliance procedures; this is not necessarily required by climate engineering. Bengtsson<ref>Bengtsson, L. (2006) 'Geo-engineering to confine climate change: is it at all feasible?' Climatic Change 77: 229\u2013234</ref> (2006) argues that \"the artificial release of sulphate aerosols is a commitment of at least several hundred years\". Yet this is true only if a long-term deployment strategy is adopted. Under a short-term, temporary strategy, implementation would instead be limited to decades.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/nclimate2493| title=A temporary, moderate and responsive scenario for solar geoengineering| journal=Nature Climate Change| volume=5| issue=3| pages=201\u2013206| year=2015| last1=Keith| first1=David W.| last2=MacMartin| first2=Douglas G.|url = https://authors.library.caltech.edu/56537/2/nclimate2493-s1.pdf| bibcode=2015NatCC...5..201K}}</ref> Both cases, however, highlight the importance for a political framework that is sustainable enough to contain a multilateral commitment over such a long period and yet is flexible as the techniques innovate through time. There are many controversies surrounding this topic and hence, climate engineering has become a very political issue. Most discussions and debates are not about which climate engineering technique is better than the other, or which one is more economically and socially feasible. Discussions are broadly on who will have control over the deployment of climate engineering and under what governance regime the deployment can be monitored and supervised. This is especially important due to the regional variability of the effects of many climate engineering techniques, benefiting some countries while damaging others. The main challenge posed by climate engineering is not how to get countries to do it. It is to address the fundamental question of who should decide whether and how climate engineering should be attempted \u2013 a problem of governance.<ref>Barrett, S (2007) Why cooperate?

Many people oppose the suggestion, but a recent study from the journal of Nature Climate Change has shown the speculation that solar geoengineering could cause extreme temperatures and increase severity of storms is actually incorrect. This journal shows that only 0.4% of places on the Earth would experience worsened weather conditions. Although no action has been carried out for spraying these gases and clouds into the atmosphere, this discovery could have a major influence on the course of action humans choose to take for reducing the greenhouse gas effect.\n\nMany critics and concerned scientists are whole-heartedly against the idea of solar geoengineering. A geophysics professor, Alan Robock, has reprimanded the Nature Climate Change journal for neglecting to mention other environmental effects that will occur from the atmospheric spray. Robock had said the choice to cool the Earth by artificial emissions would be very costly and it could serve a potential threat to different plant and animal species. Likewise, The Nature Ecology and Evolution journal predicted the use of aerosols would cause a quick transfer of temperatures from warm to cold which would not allow animals to move to a comfortable environment. Ultimately, it would cause a massive extinction of various animal and plant species.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/11/solar-geoengineering-climate-change-new-study|title=Radical plan to artificially cool Earth's climate could be safe, study finds|last=Holden|first=Emily|date=11 March 2019|website=The Guardian|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120402075822/http://www.irgc.org/-Granger-Morgan-.html Granger Morgan], Katharine Ricke (2010).

{"title_page": "List of Purdue Boilermakers head football coaches", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThe [[Purdue Boilermakers football]] program is a [[college football]] team that represents [[Purdue University]] in the [[Big Ten Conference]] in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]. The team has had 36&nbsp;head coaches and 2 interim coaches since it started playing organized football in 1887 and has been known by the nickname ''Boilermakers'' since 1891. Purdue is an original member of the Big Ten, joining in 1896 after spending six years in the Indiana Intercollegiate Athletic Association. The Boilermakers have played in 1,187&nbsp;games during their 126&nbsp;seasons. Six coaches have led the Boilermakers to postseason bowl games: [[Jack Mollenkopf]], [[Jim Young]], [[Leon Burtnett]], [[Joe Tiller]], [[Danny Hope]], and [[Jeff Brohm]]. Nine&nbsp;coaches have won conference championships with the Boilermakers: [[Snake Ames]] and [[D. M. Balliet]] in the Indiana Intercollegiate Athletic Association, and [[A. G. Scanlon]], [[James Phelan (American football)|James Phelan]], [[Noble Kizer]], [[Elmer Burnham]], [[Stu Holcomb]], Mollenkopf and Tiller in the Big Ten. No Purdue coach has led the Boilermakers to a national championship. As of the end of the 2017 season, Tiller is the all-time leader in games coached (149) and wins (87), while Mollenkopf is the all-time leader years coached (14). Ames leads the Boilermakers in [[winning percentage]] with a perfect 1.000 in his two seasons at Purdue. Among coaches with more than two seasons of tenure, Kizer has the highest winning percentage, .750, and [[Darrell Hazell]] has the lowest winning percentage, with a record of 9-33-0 (.214) in three and half seasons.\n\nOf the 36 Boilermakers coaches, five have been inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]]: [[Andy Smith (American football)|Andy Smith]], [[William Henry Dietz]], Phelan, Mollenkopf and Young. None have received National Coach of the Year honors. On December 5, 2016, Purdue hired [[Jeff Brohm]] to become the new head coach.\n\n==Key==\n{{Col-begin|width=825px}}\n{{Col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+General\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |'''#'''\n| Number of coaches{{#tag:ref|A running total of the number of coaches of the Boilermakers.

football]] program is a [[college football]] team that represents [[Purdue University]] in the [[Big Ten Conference]] in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]. The team has had 36&nbsp;head coaches and 2 interim coaches since it started playing organized football in 1887 and has been known by the nickname ''Boilermakers'' since 1891. Purdue is an original member of the Big Ten, joining in 1896 after spending six years in the Indiana Intercollegiate Athletic Association. The Boilermakers have played in 1,187&nbsp;games during their 126&nbsp;seasons. Six coaches have led the Boilermakers to postseason bowl games: [[Jack Mollenkopf]], [[Jim Young]], [[Leon Burtnett]], [[Joe Tiller]], [[Danny Hope]], and [[Jeff Brohm]]. Nine&nbsp;coaches have won conference championships with the Boilermakers: [[Snake Ames]] and [[D. M. Balliet]] in the Indiana Intercollegiate Athletic Association, and [[A. G. Scanlon]], [[James Phelan (American football)|James Phelan]], [[Noble Kizer]], [[Elmer Burnham]], [[Stu Holcomb]], Mollenkopf and Tiller in the Big Ten. No Purdue coach has led the Boilermakers to a national championship. As of the end of the 2017 season, Tiller is the all-time leader in games coached (149) and wins (87), while Mollenkopf is the all-time leader years coached (14). Ames leads the Boilermakers in [[winning percentage]] with a perfect 1.000 in his two seasons at Purdue. Among coaches with more than two seasons of tenure, Kizer has the highest winning percentage, .750, and [[Darrell Hazell]] has the lowest winning percentage, with a record of 9-33-0 (.214) in three and half seasons.\n\nOf the 36 Boilermakers coaches, five have been inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]]: [[Andy Smith (American football)|Andy Smith]], [[William Henry Dietz]], Phelan, Mollenkopf and Young. None have received National Coach of the Year honors. On December 5, 2016, Purdue hired [[Jeff Brohm]] to become the new head coach.\n\n==Key==\n{{Col-begin|width=825px}}\n{{Col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+General\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |'''#'''\n| Number of coaches{{#tag:ref|A running total of the number of coaches of the Boilermakers.

North Caloocan shares its border with Quezon City, Valenzuela and [[Marilao]], [[Meycauayan]] and [[San Jose del Monte]] in the province of [[Bulacan]].\n\n==Name==\nCaloocan as a [[toponym]] comes from the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] root word ''lo-ok''; ''kalook-lookan'' (or ''kaloob-looban'') means \"innermost area\". The city's name is colloquially spelled as '''Kalookan'''.\n\nThere is a mixed preference over the preferred spelling of the city's name. Variation, and the apparent confusion over the spelling, came about during the early 1970s, when a resolution was adopted by the municipal board, requiring the city departments to use the name \"Kalookan.\" The execution of the said resolution was interrupted when the country was placed under [[Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos|a martial law]] in September 1972. After the restoration of city and municipal councils, then-city councilor Aurora Asistio-Henson filed Resolution No. 006, amending the previous resolution and seeking to promote [[Filipino nationalism]] by requiring all residents and all offices and establishments in the city, \"whether public or private,\" to spell the name of the city as \"Kalookan.\" According to Henson, the \"Filipinized spelling\" provides essence and significance to the city's history, and she added that it should be used \"in the city hall, the barangay halls, public markets, and other places for the information and guidance of all concerned.\" Nevertheless this change in spelling was denounced by the city residents, business owners, and officials. Former legislator and mayor Virgilio Robles declared the move illegal because it lacked congressional approval. He added that the city's name is spelled as \"Caloocan\" as shown in the city charter. The general inclination of spelling in the city is \"Caloocan\" and not \"Kalookan,\" despite the existing city ordinance, although confusion has led to varied spelling choices of many businesses throughout the city. The official logo has the city's name spelled as \"Caloocan,\" and such spelling is favored by many barangays and public and private schools in the city. \"Kalookan\" is preferred by the [[Makati]]-based Directories of the Philippines Corporation (DPC), while many national newspapers and magazines, and mapmakers like the [[Mandaluyong]]-based HYDN Publishing favor \"Caloocan.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.manilatimes.net/2004/10/19/opinion/confusion-over-spelling-caloocan-or-kalookan/687279/ |title=Confusion over spelling: Caloocan or Kalookan? |work=[[The Manila Times]] |date=October 19, 2004 |accessdate=April 2, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.pna.gov.ph/opinion/pieces/166-which-is-which-caloocan-or-kalookan |title=Which is which, Caloocan or Kalookan? |work=[[Philippine News Agency]] |last=Samonte |first=Severino |date=December 6, 2018 |accessdate=April 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Philippine Revolution}}\n\n[[File:Old manila map with caloocan.jpg|200x200px|thumb|Old map of Manila and nearby areas including (south) Caloocan.]]\n[[File:20th Kansas Volunteers marching through Caloocan at night.jpg|225px|left|thumb|The ammunition train and reserves of the 20th Kansas Volunteers, Col. Frederick R. Funston, marching through Caloocan at night after the battle of February 10.]]\n\nOriginally, Caloocan was the area where the old town of [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]] and  [[Malabon|Tambobong]] met, located along the shores of Dagat-Dagatan, a crescent-shaped inland lagoon to the west. The settlement along the shore was called \u201cAromahan\u201d, or \u201cEspina\u201d to the Spaniards, and was separated from Manila Bay by a narrow ridge from Tondo towards an opening in [[Navotas|Kinabutasan]] leading to the sea. \n\nBy the late 1700s, the fishermen of Aromahan has expanded towards a hill east of Dagat-Dagatan. This naturally stony hill was called \u201cKaloogan\u201d, meaning \u201cinterior territory\u201d, which evolved from the old Tagalog word \u201cloog\u201d (synonymous with \u201cloob\u201d or \u201cinside\u201d). The \"g\" sound could have shifted to the \u201ck\u201d sound in Tagalog phonetics (e.g. baksak > bagsak) leading to the present name of the city. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Joaquin |first1=Agapito |title=The Role of Kalookan in the Nation's Quest for Freedom |url=http://68.171.43.119/kalookan/P1A1C2A.htm |accessdate=26 April 2020}}</ref>With Aromahan relegated to the periphery, this hilltop area was also settled by oppressed people from Tondo, becoming the new center of the community by 1802. To the east was a vast stretch of [[Imperata cylindrica|cogon-covered]] land,  Eventually called \u201cKalaanan\u201d, meaning flat grassland in old Tagalog, this area is now generally known as Grace Park.  \n\nCaloocan became a municipality when it was separated from Tondo in 1815. Its original territory extended to the foothills of [[Marikina]], [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]] and [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Montalban]] to the east; [[Tinajeros, Malabon|Tinajeros]], [[Tanza, Navotas|Tanza]], and Tala rivers to the north; [[San Francisco del Monte]], [[Sampaloc, Manila|Sampalok]], [[Santa Cruz, Manila|Santa Cruz]] and Tondo in the south; and Dagat-dagatan and Aromahan to the west. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caloocancity.gov.ph/departments-offices1/26-about-us |title=About Us |website=www.caloocancity.gov.ph |access-date=2019-03-20}}</ref> The local government building was set up on the relatively well-settled portion just above Libis Espina. The old Aromahan chapel was finally abandoned and a new [[Caloocan Cathedral|church was built]] facing the municipal hall. To escape the Spanish authorities, many from the area abandoned the town proper and sought refuge in the grasslands of [[Balingasa|Balintawak]] and Pugad-Lawin, in which the people fought the landlords of Hacienda de Maysilo for terrestrial rights, which went on for almost a hundred years <ref>http://caloocancity.gov.ph/images/pdfs/Caloocan-City-2017-2025-LCCAP.pdf</ref>.\n\nThe city is historically significant because it was the center of activities for the [[Katipunan]], the secret militant society that launched the [[Philippine Revolution]] during the Spanish occupation of the Philippines. In a house in Caloocan, secret meetings were held by [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]] and his men, and it was in the city's perimeters where the first armed encounter took place between the Katipunan and the Spaniards. The revolution erupted after the [[Cry of Pugad Lawin|\u201cCry of Balintawak\u201d]] led by Andres Bonifacio against their oppressors on August 30, 1896.\n\nIn 1899, the people of Caloocan showed resistance to coming to terms with the Americans, who were bent on extending their supremacy over the country. The men of Caloocan fought the new invaders on February 23, 1899, however victory eluded the local troops on the pretext of [[Antonio Luna|Antonio Luna\u2019s]] rift with [[Emilio Aguinaldo|Aguinaldo\u2019s]] loyalists <ref>http://caloocancity.gov.ph/images/pdfs/Caloocan-City-2017-2025-LCCAP.pdf</ref>. The city then saw heavy fighting in the [[Philippine\u2013American War]], at the [[Battle of Caloocan]] and the [[Second Battle of Caloocan]].\n\nIn 1901, during the formation of the province of Rizal, Caloocan was included in its matrix. [[Novaliches]] became part of Caloocan pursuant to Act 942, as amended by Act 984 and Act 1008 of the [[Philippine Commission]], which was transferred in 1949 for the formation of [[Quezon City]].\n\nIn 1961, after Republic Act No. 3278 was approved by the [[Congress of the Philippines|Philippine Congress]] and the plebiscite was conducted. Caloocan was officially inducted into cityhood on February 16, 1962\n\nIn 2020, the city and the entire metropolitan Manila was placed under community [[quarantine]] for one month starting March 15 due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Metro Manila|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n===Territorial changes===\n\n[[File:Territorial changes of Caloocan.png|thumb|Territorial changes of Caloocan. Green: existing territorial boundaries. Blue: Detached by Commonwealth Act 602 (1939). Yellow: Detached by Republic Act 392 (1949).]]\nCaloocan once encompassed a much larger, contiguous area. The districts of [[Barangays of Quezon City|Balintawak]], [[Quezon City#La Loma|La Loma]] and [[Quezon City#Novaliches|Novaliches]] were once part of Caloocan. Balintawak is a historic district because it was the original site of the \"Cry of Pugad Lawin\" (Unang Sigaw sa Balintawak) at a location called \"Kang-kong\" near Tandang Sora's house. Novaliches was an expansive sector with some hillsides that served as meeting places and hideouts for [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]] and the ''Katipunan''.\n\nBy the 1920s there was a consolidation of several municipalities. Caloocan annexed the neighbouring town of Novaliches, as stated in the Act 942, as amended by Acts 984 and 1008 of the Philippine Commission, bringing its total area to about 15,000 hectares. When [[Quezon City]] was created in 1939, Caloocan ceded 1,500 hectares of land from the barrios or sitios of Balintaw\u00e1k, Balingasa, Kaingin, Kangkong, La Loma, Malamig, Matalahib, Masambong, Galas, San Isidro, San Jos\u00e9, Santol and Tatalon. Instead of opposing the transfer, Caloocan residents willingly gave the land in the belief it will benefit the country's new [[capital city]].\n\nHowever, in 1949, Congress passed Republic Act No. 392, which redefined the Caloocan-Quezon City boundary. The barrios of Baesa, Talipap\u00e2, San Bartolom\u00e9, Pasong Tam\u00f3, Novaliches, Banlat, Kabuyao, Pugad Lawin, Bagbag, Pasong Putik, which once belonged to Novaliches and had an area of about 8,100 hectares, were excised from Caloocan. The remaining portion of the Novaliches is now called North Caloocan. This split Caloocan into two parts: a southern section that is more urbanised, and a northern section that became suburban-rural.\n\n==Geography==\nCaloocan is divided into two non-contiguous areas with a total combined area of 53.334 square kilometers. Southern Caloocan, with an area of 13.625 square kilometers, is bordered on the south by [[Manila]], on the east by [[Quezon City]], and on the north-northwest by [[Malabon]], [[Navotas]] and [[Valenzuela, Philippines|Valenzuela]]. Northern Caloocan, with an area of 39.709 square kilometers, shares its border on the south-southeast by [[Quezon City]], on the southwest by [[Valenzuela, Philippines|Valenzuela]], and on the north by [[Marilao]], [[Meycauayan]] and [[San Jose del Monte]] in the province of [[Bulacan]].\n\n===Topography===\nSouth Caloocan, where most commercial and industrial establishments are found, lies on generally flat and highly accessible land, with slopes ranging from 0-3%. The topography gradually changes into gently to moderately sloping to rolling along the [[North Luzon Expressway]], with slopes ranging from 3-18%. The highest point at 35.00 meters above sea level can be found in this area, while the lowest point is in the southern part of Dagat-Dagatan at about 0.993 meters above mean sea level.\n\nNorth Caloocan is characterized with gently to steeply undulating to rolling topography with slopes ranging from 3-18%, mostly seen in the northern and central portion, gradually transforming into a southward trend of flat lands down to the southwestern tip of the boundary. Being accessible to major roads, many industrial and residential subdivisions have been developed in this near-level land <ref>http://caloocancity.gov.ph/images/pdfs/Caloocan-City-2017-2025-LCCAP.pdf</ref>\n\n===Geology===\n[[File:Topo Map Caloocan South.png|100x100px|thumb|Elevation map of south Caloocan]]\n[[File:Topo Map Caloocan North.png|100x100px|thumb|Elevation map of north Caloocan]]\nThe geologic formation of the two portions of Caloocan City varies in type and characteristics. and are specifically classified as quaternary [[alluvium]], [[tuff]] and tuffaceous sediment, [[pyroclastic flow]] deposit, and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]]. The formation on the eastern half of Metropolitan Manila extending to the coastline of Manila Bay and including a greater part of South Caloocan, is the quaternary [[alluvium]] - consisting of unconsolidated stream\u2010deposited sediments that includes sand, silt, clay or gravel.\n\nEastward of South Caloocan, large areas consisting of [[tuff]] and tuffaceous sediment can be traced, spreading towards the whole eastern side of Metropolitan Manila. [[Pyroclastic flow]] deposit or [[igneous rocks]] formed by the lithification of ash flow are likewise present in northern fringes of South Caloocan and in most parts of North Caloocan. On the northeast borders of North Caloocan, [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate rocks]] were traced, crossing Tala Estate and extending to the province of Bulacan and the La Mesa Watershed. \n\nSoil found in both areas of Caloocan City predominantly falls under the Novaliches Series, covering 96% of the total land area of the city. The Novaliches Series is composed of reddish brown soil, friable in consistency and granular in structure. Spherical concretions are present in the subsoil and underneath are tuffaceous material of varying degrees of disintegration and weathering. Tuffaceous material is exposed by extensive erosion in some places. <ref>http://caloocancity.gov.ph/images/pdfs/Caloocan-City-2017-2025-LCCAP.pdf</ref>\n\n===Surface Drainages===\nCaloocan City has surface waters that either have natural course (creeks and rivers) or constructed to serve as drainages to remove excess water from soil surfaces. South Caloocan has about a total of 5.0 km length of open drainage canals that serve mainly the reclamation area comprising Kaunlaran Village (Dagat-Dagatan Development Project) and nearly 11.3 km length of natural surface water coursing through the different natural river systems. These include the [[Tullahan River|Tinajeros-Tullahan River]] along the Caloocan-Valenzuela boundary; Maligaya Creek within [[La Loma Cemetery]] and crossing [[Rizal Avenue|Rizal Avenue Extension]]; Casili Creek which terminates in Estero de Maypajo, and Cantarilla/Panaca creek along the Caloocan-Malabon boundary. In North Caloocan, all surface waters consist of natural streams, the longest being the  Meycauayan-Marilao River dividing Caloocan and Bulacan. Others include the Bagong Silang River, Tala, Camarin, Pasong Malapad, and Bagumbong Creeks crossing multiple subdivisions, for a total of 52.7 km length within the City\u2019s territorial boundaries.\n\n===Barangays===\nCaloocan is divided into 188 [[barangay]]s. The city uses a hybrid system for its barangays. All barangays have their corresponding numbers but only a few \u2014 mostly in the northern part \u2014 have corresponding names. However, names of barrios and districts do not necessarily coincide with barangay perimeters. Barangays in southern Caloocan are smaller compared to their northern counterparts.\n\nAmong the cities in Metro Manila, only Manila, Pasay and Caloocan implement the so-called \"Zone Systems\". A zone is a group of barangays in a district. Although a zone is considered a subdivision in the local government units, the people do not elect a leader for the zone in a popular election similar to the normal barangay or local elections. The zoning system is merely for statistical purposes. Caloocan has 16 zones. The biggest zone in Caloocan is Zone 15 in District 1 (North Caloocan) directly west of the second biggest zone in Caloocan which is Zone 16.\n\nBarangay Bagong Silang (176) is the most populous barangay in the entire country with a population of 246,515 people.{{PH census|2015}}\n\nIn 1957, the sitio of Bagbagin was separated from the barrio of Kaybiga and converted into a distinct barrio known as barrio Bagbagin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra1713.html |title=An Act to Convert the Sitio of Bagbagin, Municipality of Caloocan, Province of Rizal, into a Barrio to be known as Barrio Bagbagin of the Same Municipality and Separating it from the Barrio of Caybiga of the Same Municipality |publisher=LawPH.com |accessdate=2011-04-12}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Republic Act 6714 called for reducing the seventy (70) barangays constituting the first congressional district of Caloocan City to only thirty (30) barangays.

wikidata|income_class_ordinal}} [[{{PH wikidata|settlement_text}} of the Philippines|{{PH wikidata|settlement_text}}]] in {{PH wikidata|province}}, {{PH wikidata|country}}. According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people{{PH census|current}} making it the [[List of cities in the Philippines|fourth-most populous city]] in the [[Philippines]].\n\nIt is divided into two geographical locations with a total combined area of 5,333.40 hectares. It was formerly  part of the [[Rizal|Province of Rizal]] of the Philippines' [[Southern Tagalog|Southern Luzon Region]]. It comprises what is known as the [[Administrative divisions of Metro Manila#Districts|CAMANAVA]] area along with cities [[Malabon]], [[Navotas]] and [[Valenzuela, Philippines|Valenzuela]].\n\nSouth Caloocan is bordered by [[Manila]], [[Quezon City]], [[Malabon]], [[Navotas]] and [[Valenzuela, Metro Manila|Valenzuela]]. North Caloocan shares its border with Quezon City, Valenzuela and [[Marilao]], [[Meycauayan]] and [[San Jose del Monte]] in the province of [[Bulacan]].\n\n==Name==\nCaloocan as a [[toponym]] comes from the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] root word ''lo-ok''; ''kalook-lookan'' (or ''kaloob-looban'') means \"innermost area\". The city's name is colloquially spelled as '''Kalookan'''.\n\nThere is a mixed preference over the preferred spelling of the city's name. Variation, and the apparent confusion over the spelling, came about during the early 1970s, when a resolution was adopted by the municipal board, requiring the city departments to use the name \"Kalookan.\" The execution of the said resolution was interrupted when the country was placed under [[Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos|a martial law]] in September 1972. After the restoration of city and municipal councils, then-city councilor Aurora Asistio-Henson filed Resolution No. 006, amending the previous resolution and seeking to promote [[Filipino nationalism]] by requiring all residents and all offices and establishments in the city, \"whether public or private,\" to spell the name of the city as \"Kalookan.\" According to Henson, the \"Filipinized spelling\" provides essence and significance to the city's history, and she added that it should be used \"in the city hall, the barangay halls, public markets, and other places for the information and guidance of all concerned.\" Nevertheless this change in spelling was denounced by the city residents, business owners, and officials. Former legislator and mayor Virgilio Robles declared the move illegal because it lacked congressional approval. He added that the city's name is spelled as \"Caloocan\" as shown in the city charter. The general inclination of spelling in the city is \"Caloocan\" and not \"Kalookan,\" despite the existing city ordinance, although confusion has led to varied spelling choices of many businesses throughout the city. The official logo has the city's name spelled as \"Caloocan,\" and such spelling is favored by many barangays and public and private schools in the city. \"Kalookan\" is preferred by the [[Makati]]-based Directories of the Philippines Corporation (DPC), while many national newspapers and magazines, and mapmakers like the [[Mandaluyong]]-based HYDN Publishing favor \"Caloocan.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.manilatimes.net/2004/10/19/opinion/confusion-over-spelling-caloocan-or-kalookan/687279/ |title=Confusion over spelling: Caloocan or Kalookan? |work=[[The Manila Times]] |date=October 19, 2004 |accessdate=April 2, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.pna.gov.ph/opinion/pieces/166-which-is-which-caloocan-or-kalookan |title=Which is which, Caloocan or Kalookan? |work=[[Philippine News Agency]] |last=Samonte |first=Severino |date=December 6, 2018 |accessdate=April 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Philippine Revolution}}\n\n[[File:Old manila map with caloocan.jpg|200x200px|thumb|Old map of Manila and nearby areas including (south) Caloocan.]]\n[[File:20th Kansas Volunteers marching through Caloocan at night.jpg|225px|left|thumb|The ammunition train and reserves of the 20th Kansas Volunteers, Col. Frederick R. Funston, marching through Caloocan at night after the battle of February 10.]]\n\nOriginally, Caloocan was the area where the old town of [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]] and  [[Malabon|Tambobong]] met, located along the shores of Dagat-Dagatan, a crescent-shaped inland lagoon to the west. The settlement along the shore was called \u201cAromahan\u201d, or \u201cEspina\u201d to the Spaniards, and was separated from Manila Bay by a narrow ridge from Tondo towards an opening in [[Navotas|Kinabutasan]] leading to the sea. \n\nBy the late 1700s, the fishermen of Aromahan has expanded towards a hill east of Dagat-Dagatan. This naturally stony hill was called \u201cKaloogan\u201d, meaning \u201cinterior territory\u201d, which evolved from the old Tagalog word \u201cloog\u201d (synonymous with \u201cloob\u201d or \u201cinside\u201d). The \"g\" sound could have shifted to the \u201ck\u201d sound in Tagalog phonetics (e.g. baksak > bagsak) leading to the present name of the city. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Joaquin |first1=Agapito |title=The Role of Kalookan in the Nation's Quest for Freedom |url=http://68.171.43.119/kalookan/P1A1C2A.htm |accessdate=26 April 2020}}</ref>With Aromahan relegated to the periphery, this hilltop area was also settled by oppressed people from Tondo, becoming the new center of the community by 1802. To the east was a vast stretch of [[Imperata cylindrica|cogon-covered]] land,  Eventually called \u201cKalaanan\u201d, meaning flat grassland in old Tagalog, this area is now generally known as Grace Park.  \n\nCaloocan became a municipality when it was separated from Tondo in 1815. Its original territory extended to the foothills of [[Marikina]], [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]] and [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Montalban]] to the east; [[Tinajeros, Malabon|Tinajeros]], [[Tanza, Navotas|Tanza]], and Tala rivers to the north; [[San Francisco del Monte]], [[Sampaloc, Manila|Sampalok]], [[Santa Cruz, Manila|Santa Cruz]] and Tondo in the south; and Dagat-dagatan and Aromahan to the west. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caloocancity.gov.ph/departments-offices1/26-about-us |title=About Us |website=www.caloocancity.gov.ph |access-date=2019-03-20}}</ref> The local government building was set up on the relatively well-settled portion just above Libis Espina. The old Aromahan chapel was finally abandoned and a new [[Caloocan Cathedral|church was built]] facing the municipal hall. To escape the Spanish authorities, many from the area abandoned the town proper and sought refuge in the grasslands of [[Balingasa|Balintawak]] and Pugad-Lawin, in which the people fought the landlords of Hacienda de Maysilo for terrestrial rights, which went on for almost a hundred years <ref>http://caloocancity.gov.ph/images/pdfs/Caloocan-City-2017-2025-LCCAP.pdf</ref>.\n\nThe city is historically significant because it was the center of activities for the [[Katipunan]], the secret militant society that launched the [[Philippine Revolution]] during the Spanish occupation of the Philippines. In a house in Caloocan, secret meetings were held by [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]] and his men, and it was in the city's perimeters where the first armed encounter took place between the Katipunan and the Spaniards. The revolution erupted after the [[Cry of Pugad Lawin|\u201cCry of Balintawak\u201d]] led by Andres Bonifacio against their oppressors on August 30, 1896.\n\nIn 1899, the people of Caloocan showed resistance to coming to terms with the Americans, who were bent on extending their supremacy over the country. The men of Caloocan fought the new invaders on February 23, 1899, however victory eluded the local troops on the pretext of [[Antonio Luna|Antonio Luna\u2019s]] rift with [[Emilio Aguinaldo|Aguinaldo\u2019s]] loyalists <ref>http://caloocancity.gov.ph/images/pdfs/Caloocan-City-2017-2025-LCCAP.pdf</ref>. The city then saw heavy fighting in the [[Philippine\u2013American War]], at the [[Battle of Caloocan]] and the [[Second Battle of Caloocan]].\n\nIn 1901, during the formation of the province of Rizal, Caloocan was included in its matrix. [[Novaliches]] became part of Caloocan pursuant to Act 942, as amended by Act 984 and Act 1008 of the [[Philippine Commission]], which was transferred in 1949 for the formation of [[Quezon City]].\n\nIn 1961, after Republic Act No. 3278 was approved by the [[Congress of the Philippines|Philippine Congress]] and the plebiscite was conducted. Caloocan was officially inducted into cityhood on February 16, 1962\n\nIn 2020, the city and the entire metropolitan Manila was placed under community [[quarantine]] for one month starting March 15 due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Metro Manila|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n===Territorial changes===\n\n[[File:Territorial changes of Caloocan.png|thumb|Territorial changes of Caloocan. Green: existing territorial boundaries. Blue: Detached by Commonwealth Act 602 (1939). Yellow: Detached by Republic Act 392 (1949).]]\nCaloocan once encompassed a much larger, contiguous area. The districts of [[Barangays of Quezon City|Balintawak]], [[Quezon City#La Loma|La Loma]] and [[Quezon City#Novaliches|Novaliches]] were once part of Caloocan. Balintawak is a historic district because it was the original site of the \"Cry of Pugad Lawin\" (Unang Sigaw sa Balintawak) at a location called \"Kang-kong\" near Tandang Sora's house. Novaliches was an expansive sector with some hillsides that served as meeting places and hideouts for [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]] and the ''Katipunan''.\n\nBy the 1920s there was a consolidation of several municipalities. Caloocan annexed the neighbouring town of Novaliches, as stated in the Act 942, as amended by Acts 984 and 1008 of the Philippine Commission, bringing its total area to about 15,000 hectares. When [[Quezon City]] was created in 1939, Caloocan ceded 1,500 hectares of land from the barrios or sitios of Balintaw\u00e1k, Balingasa, Kaingin, Kangkong, La Loma, Malamig, Matalahib, Masambong, Galas, San Isidro, San Jos\u00e9, Santol and Tatalon. Instead of opposing the transfer, Caloocan residents willingly gave the land in the belief it will benefit the country's new [[capital city]].\n\nHowever, in 1949, Congress passed Republic Act No. 392, which redefined the Caloocan-Quezon City boundary. The barrios of Baesa, Talipap\u00e2, San Bartolom\u00e9, Pasong Tam\u00f3, Novaliches, Banlat, Kabuyao, Pugad Lawin, Bagbag, Pasong Putik, which once belonged to Novaliches and had an area of about 8,100 hectares, were excised from Caloocan. The remaining portion of the Novaliches is now called North Caloocan. This split Caloocan into two parts: a southern section that is more urbanised, and a northern section that became suburban-rural.\n\n==Geography==\nCaloocan is divided into two non-contiguous areas with a total combined area of 53.334 square kilometers. Southern Caloocan, with an area of 13.625 square kilometers, is bordered on the south by [[Manila]], on the east by [[Quezon City]], and on the north-northwest by [[Malabon]], [[Navotas]] and [[Valenzuela, Philippines|Valenzuela]]. Northern Caloocan, with an area of 39.709 square kilometers, shares its border on the south-southeast by [[Quezon City]], on the southwest by [[Valenzuela, Philippines|Valenzuela]], and on the north by [[Marilao]], [[Meycauayan]] and [[San Jose del Monte]] in the province of [[Bulacan]].\n\n===Topography===\nSouth Caloocan, where most commercial and industrial establishments are found, lies on generally flat and highly accessible land, with slopes ranging from 0-3%. The topography gradually changes into gently to moderately sloping to rolling along the [[North Luzon Expressway]], with slopes ranging from 3-18%. The highest point at 35.00 meters above sea level can be found in this area, while the lowest point is in the southern part of Dagat-Dagatan at about 0.993 meters above mean sea level.\n\nNorth Caloocan is characterized with gently to steeply undulating to rolling topography with slopes ranging from 3-18%, mostly seen in the northern and central portion, gradually transforming into a southward trend of flat lands down to the southwestern tip of the boundary. Being accessible to major roads, many industrial and residential subdivisions have been developed in this near-level land <ref>http://caloocancity.gov.ph/images/pdfs/Caloocan-City-2017-2025-LCCAP.pdf</ref>\n\n===Geology===\n[[File:Topo Map Caloocan South.png|100x100px|thumb|Elevation map of south Caloocan]]\n[[File:Topo Map Caloocan North.png|100x100px|thumb|Elevation map of north Caloocan]]\nThe geologic formation of the two portions of Caloocan City varies in type and characteristics. and are specifically classified as quaternary [[alluvium]], [[tuff]] and tuffaceous sediment, [[pyroclastic flow]] deposit, and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]]. The formation on the eastern half of Metropolitan Manila extending to the coastline of Manila Bay and including a greater part of South Caloocan, is the quaternary [[alluvium]] - consisting of unconsolidated stream\u2010deposited sediments that includes sand, silt, clay or gravel.\n\nEastward of South Caloocan, large areas consisting of [[tuff]] and tuffaceous sediment can be traced, spreading towards the whole eastern side of Metropolitan Manila. [[Pyroclastic flow]] deposit or [[igneous rocks]] formed by the lithification of ash flow are likewise present in northern fringes of South Caloocan and in most parts of North Caloocan. On the northeast borders of North Caloocan, [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate rocks]] were traced, crossing Tala Estate and extending to the province of Bulacan and the La Mesa Watershed. \n\nSoil found in both areas of Caloocan City predominantly falls under the Novaliches Series, covering 96% of the total land area of the city. The Novaliches Series is composed of reddish brown soil, friable in consistency and granular in structure. Spherical concretions are present in the subsoil and underneath are tuffaceous material of varying degrees of disintegration and weathering. Tuffaceous material is exposed by extensive erosion in some places. <ref>http://caloocancity.gov.ph/images/pdfs/Caloocan-City-2017-2025-LCCAP.pdf</ref>\n\n===Surface Drainages===\nCaloocan City has surface waters that either have natural course (creeks and rivers) or constructed to serve as drainages to remove excess water from soil surfaces. South Caloocan has about a total of 5.0 km length of open drainage canals that serve mainly the reclamation area comprising Kaunlaran Village (Dagat-Dagatan Development Project) and nearly 11.3 km length of natural surface water coursing through the different natural river systems. These include the [[Tullahan River|Tinajeros-Tullahan River]] along the Caloocan-Valenzuela boundary; Maligaya Creek within [[La Loma Cemetery]] and crossing [[Rizal Avenue|Rizal Avenue Extension]]; Casili Creek which terminates in Estero de Maypajo, and Cantarilla/Panaca creek along the Caloocan-Malabon boundary. In North Caloocan, all surface waters consist of natural streams, the longest being the  Meycauayan-Marilao River dividing Caloocan and Bulacan. Others include the Bagong Silang River, Tala, Camarin, Pasong Malapad, and Bagumbong Creeks crossing multiple subdivisions, for a total of 52.7 km length within the City\u2019s territorial boundaries.\n\n===Barangays===\nCaloocan is divided into 188 [[barangay]]s. The city uses a hybrid system for its barangays. All barangays have their corresponding numbers but only a few \u2014 mostly in the northern part \u2014 have corresponding names. However, names of barrios and districts do not necessarily coincide with barangay perimeters. Barangays in southern Caloocan are smaller compared to their northern counterparts.\n\nAmong the cities in Metro Manila, only Manila, Pasay and Caloocan implement the so-called \"Zone Systems\". A zone is a group of barangays in a district. Although a zone is considered a subdivision in the local government units, the people do not elect a leader for the zone in a popular election similar to the normal barangay or local elections. The zoning system is merely for statistical purposes. Caloocan has 16 zones. The biggest zone in Caloocan is Zone 15 in District 1 (North Caloocan) directly west of the second biggest zone in Caloocan which is Zone 16.\n\nBarangay Bagong Silang (176) is the most populous barangay in the entire country with a population of 246,515 people.{{PH census|2015}}\n\nIn 1957, the sitio of Bagbagin was separated from the barrio of Kaybiga and converted into a distinct barrio known as barrio Bagbagin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra1713.html |title=An Act to Convert the Sitio of Bagbagin, Municipality of Caloocan, Province of Rizal, into a Barrio to be known as Barrio Bagbagin of the Same Municipality and Separating it from the Barrio of Caybiga of the Same Municipality |publisher=LawPH.com |accessdate=2011-04-12}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Republic Act 6714 called for reducing the seventy (70) barangays constituting the first congressional district of Caloocan City to only thirty (30) barangays.
