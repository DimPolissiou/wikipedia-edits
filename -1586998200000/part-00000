In the summer of 2004, the standard TI-89 was replaced by the TI-89 Titanium.\n\nThe TI-89 runs on a 16-bit microprocessor, the [[Motorola 68000]], which nominally runs at 10, 12 [[megahertz|MHz]], depending on the calculator's hardware version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.datamath.org/Graphing/TI-89.htm|title=DATAMATH  CALCULATOR  MUSEUM Texas Instruments TI-89|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Texas Instruments has allocated 256 total [[Kilobyte|kB]] of [[random-access memory|RAM]] for the unit (190&nbsp;kB of which are available to the user) and 2&nbsp;MB of [[flash memory]] (700&nbsp;kB of which is available to the user).  The RAM and Flash ROM are used to store expressions, [[Variable (programming)|variables]], [[computer program|programs]], tables, [[text file]]s, and lists.\n\nThe TI-89 is essentially a [[TI-92 series|TI-92 Plus]] with a limited [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] and smaller screen. It was created partially in response to the fact that while [[calculators]] are allowed on many standardized tests, the TI-92 was considered a computer due to the [[QWERTY]] layout of its keyboard. Additionally, some people found the TI-92 unwieldy and overly large. The TI-89 is significantly smaller\u2014about the same size as most other graphing calculators. It has a flash ROM, a feature present on the TI-92 Plus but not on the original TI-92.\n\n=== User features ===\nThe major advantage of the TI-89 over lower-model TI calculators is its built-in [[computer algebra system]], or CAS. The calculator can evaluate and simplify algebraic expressions symbolically. For example, entering <code>x^2-4x+4</code> returns <math>x^2-4x+4</math>. The answer is \"[[prettyprint]]ed\" by default; that is, displayed as it would be written by hand (e.g. the aforementioned <math>x^2-4x+4</math> rather than <code>x^2-4x+4</code>).  The TI-89's abilities include:\n* Algebraic factoring of expressions, including [[partial fraction decomposition]].\n* Algebraic simplification; for example, the CAS can combine multiple terms into one fraction by finding a common [[denominator]].\n* Evaluation of trigonometric expressions to exact values.  For example, sin(60\u00b0) returns <math>\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}</math> instead of 0.86603.\n* Solving equations for a certain variable.  The CAS can solve for one variable in terms of others; it can also solve systems of equations.  For equations such as quadratics where there are multiple solutions, it returns all of them.  Equations with infinitely many solutions are solved by introducing arbitrary constants: <code>solve(tan(x+2)=0,x)</code> returns <code>x=2.(90.@n1-1)</code>, with the <code>@n1</code> representing any integer.\n* Finding limits of functions, including infinite limits and limits from one direction.\n* Symbolic [[derivative|differentiation]] and [[antiderivative|integration]].  [[Derivative]]s and [[definite integral]]s are evaluated exactly when possible, and approximately otherwise.\n\nIn addition to the standard two-dimensional [[function (mathematics)|function]] plots, it can also produce graphs of [[parametric equations]], [[polar coordinate systems|polar equations]], sequence plots, [[differential equation]] fields, and three-dimensional (two independent variable) functions.\n\n=== Programming ===\nThe TI-89 is directly programmable in a language called [[TI-BASIC]], TI's derivative of [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] for calculators.  With the use of a [[IBM PC compatible|PC]], it is also possible to develop more complex programs in Motorola 68000 [[assembly language]] or [[C (programming language)|C]], [[compiler|translate]] them to machine language, and copy them to the calculator. Two software development kits for C programming are available; one is TI Flash Studio, the official TI [[Software Development Kit|SDK]], and the other is [[TIGCC]], a third-party SDK based on [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]].\n\nSince the TI-89's release in 1998, thousands of programs for [[mathematics|math]], [[science]], or entertainment have been developed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Many available games are generic clones of ''[[Tetris]]'', ''[[Minesweeper (game)|Minesweeper]]'', and other classic games, but some programs are more advanced: for example, a [[ZX Spectrum]] emulator, a [[chess]]-playing program, a [[Symbulator|symbolic circuit simulator]], and a clone of ''[[Link's Awakening]]''. One of the most popular and well-known games is [[Phoenix (arcade game)|Phoenix]]. Many calculator games and other useful programs can be found on TI-program sharing sites. Ticalc.org is a major one that offers thousands of calculator programs.\n\n=== Hardware versions ===\nThere are four hardware versions of the TI-89. These versions are normally referred to as HW1, HW2, HW3, and HW4 (released in May 2006).  Entering the key sequence '''[F1] [A]''' displays the hardware version.  Older OS versions (before 2.00) don't display anything about the hardware version unless the calculator is HW2 or later.  The differences in the hardware versions are not well documented by Texas Instruments.  HW1 and HW2 correspond to the original TI-89; HW3 and HW4 are only present in the TI-89 Titanium.\n\nThe most significant difference between HW1 and HW2 is in the way the calculator handles the display. In HW1 calculators there is a video buffer that stores all of the information that should be displayed on the screen, and every time the screen is refreshed the calculator accesses this buffer and flushes it to the display ([[direct memory access]]).  In HW2 and later calculators, a region of memory is directly aliased to the display controller ([[memory-mapped I/O]]).  This allows for slightly faster memory access, as the HW1's DMA controller used about 10% of the bus bandwidth.  However, it interferes with a trick some programs use to implement [[grayscale]] graphics by rapidly switching between two or more displays ([[page-flipping]]).  On the HW1, the DMA controller's base address can be changed (a single write into a [[Memory-mapped I/O|memory-mapped]] [[hardware register]]) and the screen will automatically use a new section of memory at the beginning of the next frame.  In HW2, the new page must be written to the screen by software. The effect of this is to cause increased flickering in grayscale mode, enough to make the 7-level grayscale supported on the HW1 unusable (although 4-level grayscale works on both calculators).\n\nHW2 calculators are slightly faster because TI increased the nominal speed of the processor from 10&nbsp;MHz to 12&nbsp;MHz.  It is believed that TI increased the speed of HW4 calculators to 16&nbsp;MHz, though many users disagree about this finding.\n\nAnother difference between HW1 and HW2 calculators is assembly program size limitations. The size limitation on HW2 calculators has varied with the AMS version of the calculator. As of AMS 2.09 the limit is 24k.  Some earlier versions limited assembly programs to 8k, and the earliest AMS versions had no limit.  HW1 calculators have no hardware to enforce the limits, so it is easy to bypass them in software.  There are [[unofficial patch]]es and kernels that can be installed on HW2 calculators to remove the limitations.\n\n== TI-89 Titanium ==\n{{Infobox calculator\n| name            = TI-89 Titanium\n| image           = TI-biju.jpg\n| caption         = A TI-89 Titanium with Computer Algebra System\n| type            = [[Programmable calculator|Programmable]] [[Graphing calculator|Graphing]]\n| entry           = [[Calculator input methods#Mathematical display|DAL]]\n| introduced      = 2004\n| discontinued    = \n| latest_firmware = 3.10\n| predecessor     = TI-89\n| successor       = [[TI-Nspire#TI-Nspire CAS|TI-Nspire CAS]]\n| manufacturer    = \n| precision       = \n| processor       = [[Motorola 68000]]\n| frequency       = 16 MHz\n| display_type    = [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] [[Dot-matrix]]\n| display_size    = 160\u00d7100\n| prog_lang       = \n| memory_user     = 256&nbsp;KB RAM (188&nbsp;KB user accessible)\n| memory_rom      = 4&nbsp;MB flash memory (2.7 MB user accessible)\n| memory_step     = \n| weight          = \n| dimensions      = \n| supply          = 4 [[AAA battery|AAA batteries]],<br />1 [[SR44]]\n}}\n\nThe '''TI-89 Titanium''' was released in the summer of 2004, and has largely replaced the popular classic TI-89. The TI-89 Titanium is referred to as HW3 and uses the corresponding AMS 3.x. In 2006, new calculators were upgraded to HW4 which was supposed to offer increases in RAM and speeds up to 16&nbsp;MHz, but some benchmarks made by users reported speeds between 12.85\u201314.1&nbsp;MHz.\n\nThe touted advantages of the TI-89 Titanium over the original TI-89 include two times the flash memory (with over three times as much available to the user).  The TI-89 Titanium is essentially a [[Voyage 200]], except it doesn't have an integrated keyboard. The TI-89 Titanium also has a [[USB On-The-Go]] port, for connectivity to other TI-89 Titanium calculators, or to a computer (to store programs or update the [[operating system]]).  The TI-89 Titanium also features some pre-loaded applications, such as \"CellSheet\", a [[spreadsheet]] program also offered with other TI calculators.  The Titanium has a slightly updated CAS, which adds a few more mathematical functions, most notably implicit differentiation.  The Titanium also has a slightly differing case design from that of the TI-89 (the Titanium's case design is similar to that of the [[TI-84 Plus]]).\n\nThere are some minor compatibility issues with C and assembly programs developed for the original TI-89. Some have to be recompiled to work on the Titanium due to various small hardware changes, though in most cases the problems can be fixed by using a utility such as GhostBuster, by Olivier Armand and Kevin Kofler. This option is generally preferred as it requires no knowledge of the program, works without the need of the program's source code, is automated, and doesn't require additional computer software. In some cases, only one character needs to be changed (the ROM base on TI-89 is at 0x200000, whereas the TI-89 Titanium is at 0x800000) by hand or by patcher.  Most, if not all, of these problems are caused by the mirror memory (ghost space) or lack thereof.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n== Use in schools ==\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nThe [[Joint Council for Qualifications]] publish examination instructions on behalf of the main examination boards in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]].

While it never saw service with frontline US forces, it was supplied to [[United Kingdom|British]] and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces during the war, under the name '''Staghound'''. A number of other countries used the Staghound after the war; some vehicles continued to serve until the 1980s.\n\n==History==\nIn July 1941, the [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|US Army Ordnance]] issued specifications for a medium armored car alongside a specification for heavy armored car (which resulted in the [[T18 Boarhound]]). [[Ford Motor Company]] built a [[Six-wheel drive|six wheels, all driven]] (6 x 6) prototype which was designated [[T17 Armored Car|T17]] and [[Chevrolet]] a [[Four-wheel drive|four wheels, all driven]] (4 x 4) model designated T17E1. At the same time, the [[British Purchasing Commission]] was also looking for medium and heavy armored cars for use in [[North Africa Campaign|the war in North Africa]]. Had the U.S. adopted this, it would have been called the M6.\n\nBoth the T17 and T17E used the same turret which was designed by Rock Island Arsenal with British requirements driving some of the design features such as putting at least two crew in the turret and placing the radio in the turret so that it was close to the commander.{{sfn|Zaloga|2009|p=11}}\n\n==T17E1==\nThe British allocated the name '''Staghound''' to the T17E series. British liaison officers had had contact with Macpherson, the Chevrolet engineer in charge of the project and felt they had influenced him sufficiently to produce something that met all their requirements. Accordingly, in December the British Purchasing Commission \"formally requested\" production of 300 vehicles; the US Army authorized production of 2,000 in January 1942. The British order was confirmed in March 1942 when the pilot T17E was delivered to the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]]. Testing showed flaws but these were expected to be correctable and a further 1,500 were contracted for.{{sfn|Zaloga|2009|p=12}}\n\nProduction started in October 1942. The US Army convened a board to examine the state of the multitude of armored car projects and recommended in December 1942 the cancellation of the larger designs and standardization on a smaller vehicle. This lighter vehicle would appear as the [[M8 Greyhound]] vehicle. However the British applied for T17E1 production to be continued for the United Kingdom under Lend-Lease. 3,844 Staghounds were produced in total.\n\nThe Staghound was an innovative design that incorporated some advanced features. It had two rear-facing 6-cylinder engines with automatic transmissions (with 4 forward and 1 reverse gears) feeding through a transfer case to drive both axles. Either two- or four-wheel drive could be selected. Either engine could be shut down while in motion and taken out of the drive train. Additionally, a power steering pump was incorporated that could be switched on or off manually from the driver's instrument panel depending on steering conditions. Steering and suspension components were directly attached to the hull as the structure was rigid enough to dispense with the need for a separate chassis.\n\n==Operational service==\nThe Staghound entered service too late for use in the [[North African Campaign]] where its combination of armor, range and main armament would have been an advantage in a light forces reconnaissance role.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} As a result, it first saw operational service in Italy, where many units found its large physical size too restrictive in the narrow roads, and streets of Europe. It saw most service at squadron and regimental headquarter level;{{sfn|Taylor|2007|p=34}} an armoured car regiment having three Staghounds with the Regimental HQ and three with each HQ of the four squadrons in the regiment.<ref>B.T. White AFV Profile No 21, ''Armoured Cars'' Profile Publishing</ref> Conditions for the Staghound improved when the Italian campaign became more mobile in the middle of 1944, and the Staghound was also used in north-west Europe campaign.{{sfn|Zaloga|2009|p=5}}\n\nAfter the war, the Staghounds were distributed among smaller NATO countries in Europe and to the Middle East.{{sfn|Zaloga|2009|p=5}} For instance, Staghounds were used during [[Lebanese civil war]] by Christian militias.<ref name = 'Lebanon'>{{cite book|author1 = Paul A.

While it never saw service with frontline US forces, it was supplied to [[United Kingdom|British]] and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces during the war, under the name '''Staghound'''. A number of other countries used the Staghound after the war; some vehicles continued to serve until the 1980s.\n\n==History==\nIn July 1941, the [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|US Army Ordnance]] issued specifications for a medium armored car alongside a specification for heavy armored car (which resulted in the [[T18 Boarhound]]). [[Ford Motor Company]] built a [[Six-wheel drive|six wheels, all driven]] (6 x 6) prototype which was designated [[T17 Armored Car|T17]] and [[Chevrolet]] a [[Four-wheel drive|four wheels, all driven]] (4 x 4) model designated T17E1. At the same time, the [[British Purchasing Commission]] was also looking for medium and heavy armored cars for use in [[North Africa Campaign|the war in North Africa]]. Had the U.S. adopted this, it would have been called the M6.\n\nBoth the T17 and T17E used the same turret which was designed by Rock Island Arsenal with British requirements driving some of the design features such as putting at least two crew in the turret and placing the radio in the turret so that it was close to the commander.{{sfn|Zaloga|2009|p=11}}\n\n==T17E1==\nThe British allocated the name '''Staghound''' to the T17E series. British liaison officers had had contact with Macpherson, the Chevrolet engineer in charge of the project and felt they had influenced him sufficiently to produce something that met all their requirements. Accordingly, in December the British Purchasing Commission \"formally requested\" production of 300 vehicles; the US Army authorized production of 2,000 in January 1942. The British order was confirmed in March 1942 when the pilot T17E was delivered to the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]]. Testing showed flaws but these were expected to be correctable and a further 1,500 were contracted for.{{sfn|Zaloga|2009|p=12}}\n\nProduction started in October 1942. The US Army convened a board to examine the state of the multitude of armored car projects and recommended in December 1942 the cancellation of the larger designs and standardization on a smaller vehicle. This lighter vehicle would appear as the [[M8 Greyhound]] vehicle. However the British applied for T17E1 production to be continued for the United Kingdom under Lend-Lease. 3,844 Staghounds were produced in total.\n\nThe Staghound was an innovative design that incorporated some advanced features. It had two rear-facing 6-cylinder engines with automatic transmissions (with 4 forward and 1 reverse gears) feeding through a transfer case to drive both axles. Either two- or four-wheel drive could be selected. Either engine could be shut down while in motion and taken out of the drive train. Additionally, a power steering pump was incorporated that could be switched on or off manually from the driver's instrument panel depending on steering conditions. Steering and suspension components were directly attached to the hull as the structure was rigid enough to dispense with the need for a separate chassis.\n\n==Operational service==\nThe Staghound entered service too late for use in the [[North African Campaign]] where its combination of armor, range and main armament would have been an advantage in a light forces reconnaissance role.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} As a result, it first saw operational service in Italy, where many units found its large physical size too restrictive in the narrow roads, and streets of Europe. It saw most service at squadron and regimental headquarter level;{{sfn|Taylor|2007|p=34}} an armoured car regiment having three Staghounds with the Regimental HQ and three with each HQ of the four squadrons in the regiment.<ref>B.T. White AFV Profile No 21, ''Armoured Cars'' Profile Publishing</ref> Conditions for the Staghound improved when the Italian campaign became more mobile in the middle of 1944, and the Staghound was also used in north-west Europe campaign.{{sfn|Zaloga|2009|p=5}}\n\nAfter the war, the Staghounds were distributed among smaller NATO countries in Europe and to the Middle East.{{sfn|Zaloga|2009|p=5}} For instance, Staghounds were used during [[Lebanese civil war]] by Christian militias<ref name = 'Lebanon'>{{cite book|author1 = Paul A.

{"title_page": "T-duality", "text_new": "{{String theory|cTopic=Theory}}\n\nIn [[theoretical physics]], '''T-duality''' (short for '''target-space duality''') is an equivalence of two physical theories, which may be either [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] or [[string theory|string theories]]. In the simplest example of this relationship, one of the theories describes [[string (physics)|strings]] propagating in an imaginary [[spacetime]] shaped like a circle of some radius <math>R</math>, while the other theory describes strings propagating on a spacetime shaped like a circle of radius proportional to <math>1/R</math>. The idea of T-duality was first noted by Bala Sathiapalan in an obscure paper in 1987.<ref>Sathiapalan 1987</ref> The two T-dual theories are equivalent in the sense that all observable quantities in one description are identified with quantities in the dual description. For example, [[momentum]] in one description takes discrete values and is equal to the number of times the string [[winding number|winds]] around the circle in the dual description.\n\nThe idea of T-duality can be extended to more complicated theories, including [[superstring theory|superstring theories]]. The existence of these dualities implies that seemingly different superstring theories are actually physically equivalent. This led to the realization, in the mid-1990s, that all of the five consistent superstring theories are just different limiting cases of a single eleven-dimensional theory called [[M-theory]].\n\nIn general, T-duality relates two theories with different spacetime geometries. In this way, T-duality suggests a possible scenario in which the classical notions of geometry break down in a theory of [[Planck scale]] physics.<ref>Seiberg 2006</ref> The geometric relationships suggested by T-duality are also important in [[pure mathematics]]. Indeed, according to the [[SYZ conjecture]] of [[Andrew Strominger]], [[Shing-Tung Yau]], and [[Eric Zaslow]], T-duality is closely related to another duality called [[mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]], which has important applications in a branch of mathematics called [[enumerative geometry|enumerative algebraic geometry]].\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Strings and duality===\n\nT-duality is a particular example of a general notion of [[string duality|duality]] in physics. The term ''duality'' refers to a situation where two seemingly different [[physical system]]s turn out to be equivalent in a nontrivial way. If two theories are related by a duality, it means that one theory can be transformed in some way so that it ends up looking just like the other theory. The two theories are then said to be ''dual'' to one another under the transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena.\n\nLike many of the dualities studied in theoretical physics, T-duality was discovered in the context of [[string theory]].<ref>Sathiapalan 1987. Other dualities that arise in string theory are [[S-duality]], [[U-duality]], [[mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]], and the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]].</ref> In string theory, particles are modeled not as zero-dimensional points but as one-dimensional extended objects called [[string (physics)|strings]]. The physics of strings can be studied in various numbers of dimensions. In addition to three familiar dimensions from everyday experience (up/down, left/right, forward/backward), string theories may include one or more [[compact dimension]]s which are curled up into circles.\n\nA standard analogy for this is to consider multidimensional object such as a garden hose.<ref>This analogy is used for example in Greene 2000, p.186</ref> If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, it appears to have only one dimension, its length. However, as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling inside it would move in two dimensions. Such extra dimensions are important in T-duality, which relates a theory in which strings propagate on a circle of some radius <math>R</math> to a theory in which strings propagate on a circle of radius <math>1/R</math>.\n\n===Winding numbers===\n\n{{main|Winding number}}\n\nIn mathematics, the [[winding number]] of a [[curve]] in the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] around a given [[point (mathematics)|point]] is an [[integer]] representing the total number of times that curve travels counterclockwise around the point. The notion of winding number is important in the mathematical description of T-duality where it is used to measure the winding of strings around [[compactification (physics)|compact]] [[extra dimensions]].\n\nFor example, the image below shows several examples of curves in the plane, illustrated in red. Each curve is assumed to be [[closed manifold|closed]], meaning it has no endpoints, and is allowed to intersect itself. Each curve has an [[Orientability|orientation]] given by the arrows in the picture. In each situation, there is a distinguished point in the plane, illustrated in black. The ''winding number'' of the curve around this distinguished point is equal to the total number of counterclockwise [[Turn (geometry)|turns]] that the curve makes around this point.\n\n{| align=\"center\" border=0 cellpadding=0\n|-valign=\"center\"\n|<math>\\cdots</math>\n|align=\"center\"|&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Image:Winding Number -2.svg|80px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Image:Winding Number -1.svg|80px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Image:Winding Number 0.svg|80px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|\n|-valign=\"top\" style=\"height:3em\"\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\u22122\n|align=\"center\"|\u22121\n|align=\"center\"|0\n|\n|-valign=\"center\"\n|\n|align=\"center\"|&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Image:Winding Number 1.svg|80px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Image:Winding Number 2.svg|80px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Image:Winding Number 3.svg|80px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|<math>\\cdots</math>\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|align=\"center\"|2\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|\n|}\n\nWhen counting the total number of turns, counterclockwise turns count as positive, while clockwise turns counts as [[negative number|negative]].  For example, if the curve first circles the origin four times counterclockwise, and then circles the origin once clockwise, then the total winding number of the curve is three. According to this scheme, a curve that does not travel around the distinguished point at all has winding number zero, while a curve that travels clockwise around the point has negative winding number. Therefore, the winding number of a curve may be any integer. The pictures above show curves with winding numbers between \u22122 and 3:\n\n===Quantized momenta===\n\nThe simplest theories in which T-duality arises are [[two-dimensional]] [[sigma model]]s with circular target spaces. These are simple quantum field theories that describe propagation of strings in an imaginary spacetime shaped like a circle. The strings can thus be modeled as curves in the plane that are confined to lie in a circle, say of radius <math>R</math>, about the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]. In what follows, the strings are assumed to be closed (that is, without endpoints).\n\nDenote this circle by <math>S_R^1</math>. One can think of this circle as a copy of the [[real line]] with two points [[Quotient space (topology)|identified]] if they differ by a multiple of the circle's circumference <math>2\\pi R</math>. It follows that the state of a string at any given time can be represented as a function <math>\\varphi(\\theta)</math> of a single real parameter <math>\\theta</math>. Such a function can be expanded in a [[Fourier series]] as\n\n:<math>\\varphi(\\theta)=mR\\theta+x+\\sum_{n\\neq0}c_ne^{in\\theta}</math>.\n\nHere <math>m</math> denotes the winding number of the string around the circle, and the constant mode <math>x=c_0</math> of the Fourier series has been singled out. Since this expression represents the configuration of a string at a fixed time, all coefficients (<math>x</math> and the <math>c_n</math>) are also functions of time.\n\nLet <math>\\dot{x}</math> denote the time derivative of the constant mode <math>x</math>. This represents a type of [[momentum]] in the theory. One can show, using the fact that the strings considered here are closed, that this momentum can only take on discrete values of the form <math>\\dot{x}=n/R</math> for some integer <math>n</math>. In more physical language, one says that the momentum spectrum is ''quantized''.\n\n===An equivalence of theories===\n\nIn the situation described above, the total energy, or [[Hamiltonian function|Hamiltonian]], of the string is given by the expression\n\n:<math>H=(mR)^2+\\dot{x}^2+\\sum_n|\\dot{c}_n|^2+n^2|c_n|^2</math>.\n\nSince the momenta of the theory are quantized, the first two terms in this formula are <math>(mR)^2+(n/R)^2</math>, and this expression is unchanged when one simultaneously replaces the radius <math>R</math> by <math>1/R</math> and exchanges the winding number <math>m</math> and the integer <math>n</math>. The summation in the expression for <math>H</math> is similarly unaffected by these changes, so the total energy is unchanged. In fact, this equivalence of Hamiltonians descends to an equivalence of two quantum mechanical theories: One of these theories describes strings propagating on a circle of radius <math>R</math>, while the other describes string propagating in a circle of radius <math>1/R</math> with momentum and winding numbers interchanged. This equivalence of theories is the simplest manifestation of T-duality.\n\n==Superstrings==\n\n[[File:Dualities of string and M-theory.jpg|right|thumb|350px|A diagram of string theory dualities. Yellow lines indicate [[S-duality]].

The different theories allow different types of strings, and the particles that arise at low energies exhibit different symmetries.\n\nIn the mid 1990s, physicists noticed that these five string theories are actually related by highly nontrivial dualities. One of these dualities is T-duality. For example, it was shown that type IIA string theory is equivalent to type IIB string theory via T-duality and also that the two versions of heterotic string theory are related by T-duality.\n\nThe existence of these dualities showed that the five string theories were in fact not all distinct theories. In 1995, at the string theory conference at [[University of Southern California]], [[Edward Witten]] made the surprising suggestion that all five of these theories were just different limits of a single theory now known as [[M-theory]].<ref>Witten 1995</ref> Witten's proposal was based on the observation that different superstring theories are linked by dualities and the fact that type IIA and E<sub>8</sub>\u00d7E<sub>8</sub> heterotic string theories are closely related to a gravitational theory called eleven-dimensional [[supergravity]]. His announcement led to a flurry of work now known as the [[second superstring revolution]].\n\n==Mirror symmetry==\n\n{{main|Mirror symmetry (string theory)}}\n\n[[Image:Calabi yau.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A hypersurface of a six-dimensional [[Calabi\u2013Yau manifold]]. ]]\n\nIn string theory and [[algebraic geometry]], the term \"[[mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]]\" refers to a phenomenon involving complicated shapes called [[Calabi-Yau manifolds]]. These manifolds provide an interesting geometry on which strings can propagate, and the resulting theories may have applications in [[particle physics]].<ref>Candelas et al. 1985</ref> In the late 1980s, it was noticed that such a Calabi-Yau manifold does not uniquely determine the physics of the theory. Instead, one finds that there are ''two'' Calabi-Yau manifolds that give rise to the same physics.<ref>Dixon 1988; Lerche, Vafa, and Warner 1989</ref> These manifolds are said to be \"mirror\" to one another. This mirror duality is an important computational tool in string theory, and it has allowed mathematicians to solve difficult problems in [[enumerative geometry]].<ref>Zaslow 2008</ref>\n\n[[File:torus cycles.png|thumb|175px|right|A [[torus]] is the [[cartesian product]] of two circles.]]\n\nOne approach to understanding mirror symmetry is the [[SYZ conjecture]], which was suggested by [[Andrew Strominger]], [[Shing-Tung Yau]], and [[Eric Zaslow]] in 1996.<ref>Strominger, Yau, and Zaslow 1996</ref> According to the SYZ conjecture, mirror symmetry can be understood by dividing a complicated Calabi-Yau manifold into simpler pieces and considering the effects of T-duality on these pieces.<ref>Yau and Nadis 2010, p.174</ref>\n\nThe simplest example of a Calabi-Yau manifold is a [[torus]] (a surface shaped like a donut). Such a surface can be viewed as the [[cartesian product|product]] of two circles. This means that the torus can be viewed as the [[union (set theory)|union]] of a collection of longitudinal circles (such as the red circle in the image). There is an auxiliary space which says how these circles are organized, and this space is itself a circle (the pink circle). This space is said to ''parametrize'' the longitudinal circles on the torus. In this case, mirror symmetry is equivalent to T-duality acting on the longitudinal circles, changing their radii from <math>R</math> to <math>\\alpha'/R</math>, with <math>\\alpha '</math> the inverse of the string tension.\n\nThe SYZ conjecture generalizes this idea to the more complicated case of six-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds like the one illustrated above. As in the case of a torus, one can divide a six-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold into simpler pieces, which in this case are [[3-torus|3-tori]] (three-dimensional objects which generalize the notion of a torus) parametrized by a [[3-sphere]] (a three-dimensional generalization of a sphere).<ref>More precisely, there is a 3-torus associated to every point on the three-sphere except at certain bad points, which correspond to singular tori. See Yau and Nadis 2010, pp.176\u20137.</ref> T-duality can be extended from circles to the three-dimensional tori appearing in this decomposition, and the SYZ conjecture states that mirror symmetry is equivalent to the simultaneous application of T-duality to these three-dimensional tori.<ref>Yau and Nadis 2010, p.178</ref> In this way, the SYZ conjecture provides a geometric picture of how mirror symmetry acts on a Calabi-Yau manifold.\n\n==See also==\n*[[S-duality]]\n*[[Mirror symmetry (string theory)|Mirror symmetry]]\n*[[AdS/CFT correspondence]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal |last1=Sathiapalan |first1=Bala |date=1987 |title=Duality in Statistical Mechanics and String Theory |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=58 |issue=16 |pages=1597\u20139|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.58.1597 |pmid=10034485 }}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Candelas |first1=Philip |last2=Horowitz |first2=Gary |last3=Strominger |first3= Andrew |last4=Witten |first4=Edward |date=1985 |title=Vacuum configurations for superstrings |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=258 |pages=46\u201374|bibcode = 1985NuPhB.258...46C |doi = 10.1016/0550-3213(85)90602-9 }}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Dixon |first1=Lance |date=1988 |title=Some world-sheet properties of superstring compactifications, on orbifolds and otherwise |journal=ICTP Ser.

In the simplest example of this relationship, one of the theories describes [[string (physics)|strings]] propagating in an imaginary [[spacetime]] shaped like a circle of some radius <math>R</math>, while the other theory describes strings propagating on a spacetime shaped like a circle of radius proportional to <math>1/R</math>. The idea of T-duality was first noted by Bala Sathiapalan in an obscure paper in 1987<ref>Sathiapalan 1987</ref>. The two T-dual theories are equivalent in the sense that all observable quantities in one description are identified with quantities in the dual description. For example, [[momentum]] in one description takes discrete values and is equal to the number of times the string [[winding number|winds]] around the circle in the dual description.\n\nThe idea of T-duality can be extended to more complicated theories, including [[superstring theory|superstring theories]]. The existence of these dualities implies that seemingly different superstring theories are actually physically equivalent. This led to the realization, in the mid-1990s, that all of the five consistent superstring theories are just different limiting cases of a single eleven-dimensional theory called [[M-theory]].\n\nIn general, T-duality relates two theories with different spacetime geometries. In this way, T-duality suggests a possible scenario in which the classical notions of geometry break down in a theory of [[Planck scale]] physics.<ref>Seiberg 2006</ref> The geometric relationships suggested by T-duality are also important in [[pure mathematics]]. Indeed, according to the [[SYZ conjecture]] of [[Andrew Strominger]], [[Shing-Tung Yau]], and [[Eric Zaslow]], T-duality is closely related to another duality called [[mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]], which has important applications in a branch of mathematics called [[enumerative geometry|enumerative algebraic geometry]].\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Strings and duality===\n\nT-duality is a particular example of a general notion of [[string duality|duality]] in physics. The term ''duality'' refers to a situation where two seemingly different [[physical system]]s turn out to be equivalent in a nontrivial way. If two theories are related by a duality, it means that one theory can be transformed in some way so that it ends up looking just like the other theory. The two theories are then said to be ''dual'' to one another under the transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena.\n\nLike many of the dualities studied in theoretical physics, T-duality was discovered in the context of [[string theory]].<ref>Sathiapalan 1987. Other dualities that arise in string theory are [[S-duality]], [[U-duality]], [[mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]], and the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]].</ref> In string theory, particles are modeled not as zero-dimensional points but as one-dimensional extended objects called [[string (physics)|strings]]. The physics of strings can be studied in various numbers of dimensions. In addition to three familiar dimensions from everyday experience (up/down, left/right, forward/backward), string theories may include one or more [[compact dimension]]s which are curled up into circles.\n\nA standard analogy for this is to consider multidimensional object such as a garden hose.<ref>This analogy is used for example in Greene 2000, p.186</ref> If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, it appears to have only one dimension, its length. However, as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling inside it would move in two dimensions. Such extra dimensions are important in T-duality, which relates a theory in which strings propagate on a circle of some radius <math>R</math> to a theory in which strings propagate on a circle of radius <math>1/R</math>.\n\n===Winding numbers===\n\n{{main|Winding number}}\n\nIn mathematics, the [[winding number]] of a [[curve]] in the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] around a given [[point (mathematics)|point]] is an [[integer]] representing the total number of times that curve travels counterclockwise around the point. The notion of winding number is important in the mathematical description of T-duality where it is used to measure the winding of strings around [[compactification (physics)|compact]] [[extra dimensions]].\n\nFor example, the image below shows several examples of curves in the plane, illustrated in red. Each curve is assumed to be [[closed manifold|closed]], meaning it has no endpoints, and is allowed to intersect itself. Each curve has an [[Orientability|orientation]] given by the arrows in the picture. In each situation, there is a distinguished point in the plane, illustrated in black. The ''winding number'' of the curve around this distinguished point is equal to the total number of counterclockwise [[Turn (geometry)|turns]] that the curve makes around this point.\n\n{| align=\"center\" border=0 cellpadding=0\n|-valign=\"center\"\n|<math>\\cdots</math>\n|align=\"center\"|&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Image:Winding Number -2.svg|80px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Image:Winding Number -1.svg|80px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Image:Winding Number 0.svg|80px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|\n|-valign=\"top\" style=\"height:3em\"\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\u22122\n|align=\"center\"|\u22121\n|align=\"center\"|0\n|\n|-valign=\"center\"\n|\n|align=\"center\"|&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Image:Winding Number 1.svg|80px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Image:Winding Number 2.svg|80px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Image:Winding Number 3.svg|80px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|<math>\\cdots</math>\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|align=\"center\"|2\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|\n|}\n\nWhen counting the total number of turns, counterclockwise turns count as positive, while clockwise turns counts as [[negative number|negative]].  For example, if the curve first circles the origin four times counterclockwise, and then circles the origin once clockwise, then the total winding number of the curve is three. According to this scheme, a curve that does not travel around the distinguished point at all has winding number zero, while a curve that travels clockwise around the point has negative winding number. Therefore, the winding number of a curve may be any integer. The pictures above show curves with winding numbers between \u22122 and 3:\n\n===Quantized momenta===\n\nThe simplest theories in which T-duality arises are [[two-dimensional]] [[sigma model]]s with circular target spaces. These are simple quantum field theories that describe propagation of strings in an imaginary spacetime shaped like a circle. The strings can thus be modeled as curves in the plane that are confined to lie in a circle, say of radius <math>R</math>, about the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]. In what follows, the strings are assumed to be closed (that is, without endpoints).\n\nDenote this circle by <math>S_R^1</math>. One can think of this circle as a copy of the [[real line]] with two points [[Quotient space (topology)|identified]] if they differ by a multiple of the circle's circumference <math>2\\pi R</math>. It follows that the state of a string at any given time can be represented as a function <math>\\varphi(\\theta)</math> of a single real parameter <math>\\theta</math>. Such a function can be expanded in a [[Fourier series]] as\n\n:<math>\\varphi(\\theta)=mR\\theta+x+\\sum_{n\\neq0}c_ne^{in\\theta}</math>.\n\nHere <math>m</math> denotes the winding number of the string around the circle, and the constant mode <math>x=c_0</math> of the Fourier series has been singled out. Since this expression represents the configuration of a string at a fixed time, all coefficients (<math>x</math> and the <math>c_n</math>) are also functions of time.\n\nLet <math>\\dot{x}</math> denote the time derivative of the constant mode <math>x</math>. This represents a type of [[momentum]] in the theory. One can show, using the fact that the strings considered here are closed, that this momentum can only take on discrete values of the form <math>\\dot{x}=n/R</math> for some integer <math>n</math>. In more physical language, one says that the momentum spectrum is ''quantized''.\n\n===An equivalence of theories===\n\nIn the situation described above, the total energy, or [[Hamiltonian function|Hamiltonian]], of the string is given by the expression\n\n:<math>H=(mR)^2+\\dot{x}^2+\\sum_n|\\dot{c}_n|^2+n^2|c_n|^2</math>.\n\nSince the momenta of the theory are quantized, the first two terms in this formula are <math>(mR)^2+(n/R)^2</math>, and this expression is unchanged when one simultaneously replaces the radius <math>R</math> by <math>1/R</math> and exchanges the winding number <math>m</math> and the integer <math>n</math>. The summation in the expression for <math>H</math> is similarly unaffected by these changes, so the total energy is unchanged. In fact, this equivalence of Hamiltonians descends to an equivalence of two quantum mechanical theories: One of these theories describes strings propagating on a circle of radius <math>R</math>, while the other describes string propagating in a circle of radius <math>1/R</math> with momentum and winding numbers interchanged.

See Yau and Nadis 2010, pp.176\u20137.</ref> T-duality can be extended from circles to the three-dimensional tori appearing in this decomposition, and the SYZ conjecture states that mirror symmetry is equivalent to the simultaneous application of T-duality to these three-dimensional tori.<ref>Yau and Nadis 2010, p.178</ref> In this way, the SYZ conjecture provides a geometric picture of how mirror symmetry acts on a Calabi-Yau manifold.\n\n==See also==\n*[[S-duality]]\n*[[Mirror symmetry (string theory)|Mirror symmetry]]\n*[[AdS/CFT correspondence]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal |last1=Sathiapalan |first1=Bala |date=1987 |title=Duality in Statistical Mechanics and String Theory |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=58 |issue=16 |pages=1597\u20139|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.58.1597 |pmid=10034485 }}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Candelas |first1=Philip |last2=Horowitz |first2=Gary |last3=Strominger |first3= Andrew |last4=Witten |first4=Edward |date=1985 |title=Vacuum configurations for superstrings |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=258 |pages=46\u201374|bibcode = 1985NuPhB.258...46C |doi = 10.1016/0550-3213(85)90602-9 }}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Dixon |first1=Lance |date=1988 |title=Some world-sheet properties of superstring compactifications, on orbifolds and otherwise |journal=ICTP Ser.

Except for the brass 50 c\u00eantimos and 1 dobra, these coins were struck in cupro-nickel, as was the 50 dobras introduced in 1990. These coins depicted a combination of food produce and local flora and fauna. These coins, although seldom seen in circulation today due to [[chronic inflation]] have never been demonetized and can still be used as tender.\n\nIn 1997, a new coin series with larger denominations was introduced consisting of 100, 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 dobras. Of these, the 100 and 250 dobras are round, the larger of the three are [[equilateral curve|equilaterally curved]] heptagonal. These coins were all struck in nickel-plated steel and depict wildlife-related themes. \n\nAll circulating coins bear the country's coat of arms on the obverse, with the text \"Aumentemos a Produ\u00e7\u00e3o\" and the valuation on the reverse.\n\n===Second dobra===\nWith the redenomination of the dobra in 2018, coins were introduced in denominations of 10, 20, and 50 c\u00eantimos and 1 and 2 dobras.\n\n==Banknotes==\n===First dobra===\nOn 30 September 1977, notes were introduced for 50, 100, 500 and 1000 dobras by the [[Banco Nacional de S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 e Pr\u00edncipe]].<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Linzmayer | first1 = Owen | title = The Banknote Book | chapter = Sao Tome and Principe | publisher = www.BanknoteNews.com | year = 2012 | location = San Francisco, CA | url = http://www.banknotebook.com}}</ref> In 1996, 5000, 10,000, 20,000 and 50,000 dobras notes were introduced, with the lowest denomination notes from the previous series being replaced by coins in 1997. A new issue was released in 2006 with upgraded security features.\n\nIn December 2008, the 100,000 dobras note was introduced as continuous inflation deemed the new denomination necessary. The note has been very well received and accepted by the general public.\n\nAll notes bear the portrait of [[Rei Amador]] on the obverse, however, on the 100,000 dobras note is the printed portrait of [[Francisco Jos\u00e9 Tenreiro]].\n\n===Second dobra===\nBanknotes of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 dobras were issued in 2018 with the redenomination of the dobra. The 5 and 10 dobra notes are printed in [[polymer banknote|polymer]], and all the banknotes feature various species of butterfly on the obverse with local wildlife depicted on the reverses.\n\n==Historical exchange rates (STD)==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Crystallized intelligence correlates with abilities that depend on knowledge and experience, such as vocabulary, general information, and analogies. Paul Kline identified a number of factors that shared a correlation of at least r=.60 with ''g''<sub>f</sub> and ''g''<sub>c</sub>.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kline |first1=P. |year=1998 |title=The new psychometrics: Science, psychology and measurement |location=London |publisher=Routledge}}{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref> Factors with {{clarify span|median loadings|date=February 2013}} of greater than 0.6 on ''g''<sub>f</sub> included induction, visualization, quantitative reasoning, and ideational fluency. Factors with median loadings of greater than 0.6 on ''g''<sub>c</sub> included verbal ability, language development, reading comprehension, sequential reasoning, and general information. It may be suggested that tests of intelligence may not be able to truly reflect levels of fluid intelligence. Some authors have suggested that unless an individual was truly interested in the problem presented, the cognitive work required may not be performed because of a lack of interest.<ref>{{cite journal |jstor=1175249 |doi=10.3102/0013189X018002005 |title=Meaning and Values in Test Validation: The Science and Ethics of Assessment |year=1989 |last1=Messick |first1=Samuel |journal=Educational Researcher |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=5\u201311}}</ref> These authors contend that a low score on tests which are intended to measure fluid intelligence may reflect more a lack of interest in the tasks themselves rather than any sort of inability to complete the tasks successfully.\n\n==Measurement of fluid intelligence==\nThere are various measures that assess fluid intelligence.

On Concept Formation tasks, the individual has to apply concepts by inferring the underlying \"rules\" for solving visual puzzles that are presented in increasing levels of difficulty. Individuals at the preschool level have to point to a shape that is different from others in a set. As the level of difficulty increases, individuals increasingly demonstrate an understanding of what constitutes a key difference (or the \"rule\") for solving puzzles involving one to one comparisons, and on later items identifying common differences among a set of items. For more difficult items, individuals need to understand the concept of \"and\" (e.g. solution must have some of this and some of that) and the concept of \"or\" (e.g. to be inside a box, the item must be either this or that). The most difficult items require fluid transformations and cognitive shifting between the various types of concept puzzles that the examinee has worked with previously.<ref name=\"Schrank\">{{cite book |last1=Schrank |first1=F.

In the Analysis-Synthesis test, the individual has to learn and orally state the solutions to incomplete logic puzzles that mimic a miniature mathematics system. The test also contains some of the features involved in using symbolic formulations in other fields such as chemistry and logic. The individual is presented with a set of logic rules, a \"key\" that is used to solve the puzzles. The individual has to determine the missing colors within each of the puzzles using the key. Complex items present puzzles that require two or more sequential mental manipulations of the key to derive a final solution. Increasingly difficult items involve a mix of puzzles that require fluid shifts in deduction, logic, and inference.<ref name=\"Schrank\" /> Analysis Synthesis tasks assess general sequential reasoning.\n\nIn the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]]-IV (WISC IV),<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wechsler |first1=D. |year=2003 |title=WISC-IV technical and interpretive manual |location=San Antonio, TX |publisher=Psychological Corporation}}{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref> the Perceptual Reasoning Index contains two subtests that assess Gf: Matrix Reasoning, which involves induction and deduction, and Picture Concepts, which involves induction.<ref name=\"Flanagan\">{{cite book |last1=Flanagan |first1=D.

This task assesses the child's ability to discover the underlying characteristic (e.g. rule, concept, trend, class membership) that governs a set of materials. Matrix Reasoning also tests this ability as well as the ability to start with stated rules, premises, or conditions and to engage in one or more steps to reach a solution to a novel problem (deduction). In the Matrix Reasoning test, children are presented a series or sequence of pictures with one picture missing. Their task is to choose the picture that fits the series or sequence from an array of five options. Since Matrix Reasoning and Picture Concepts involve the use of visual stimuli and do not require expressive language, they are considered to be non-verbal tests of Gf.<ref name=\"Flanagan\" />\n\nWithin the corporate environment, fluid intelligence is a predictor of a person's capacity to work well in environments characterised by complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity. The Cognitive Process Profile (CPP) measures  a person's fluid intelligence and cognitive processes. It maps these against suitable work environments according to [[Elliott Jacques]] Stratified Systems Theory.\n\n==Development and physiology==\n\nFluid intelligence, like [[reaction time]], typically peaks in young adulthood and then steadily declines.

On Concept Formation tasks, the individual has to apply concepts by inferring the underlying \"rules\" for solving visual puzzles that are presented in increasing levels of difficulty. Individuals at the preschool level have to point to a shape that is different from others in a set. As the level of difficulty increases, individuals increasingly demonstrate an understanding of what constitutes a key difference (or the \"rule\") for solving puzzles involving one to one comparisons, and on later items identifying common differences among a set of items. For more difficult items, individuals need to understand the concept of \"and\" (e.g. solution must have some of this and some of that) and the concept of \"or\" (e.g. to be inside a box, the item must be either this or that). The most difficult items require fluid transformations and cognitive shifting between the various types of concept puzzles that the examinee has worked with previously.<ref name=\"Schrank\">{{cite book |last1=Schrank |first1=F.

In the Analysis-Synthesis test, the individual has to learn and orally state the solutions to incomplete logic puzzles that mimic a miniature mathematics system. The test also contains some of the features involved in using symbolic formulations in other fields such as chemistry and logic. The individual is presented with a set of logic rules, a \"key\" that is used to solve the puzzles. The individual has to determine the missing colors within each of the puzzles using the key. Complex items present puzzles that require two or more sequential mental manipulations of the key to derive a final solution. Increasingly difficult items involve a mix of puzzles that require fluid shifts in deduction, logic, and inference.<ref name=\"Schrank\" /> Analysis Synthesis tasks assess general sequential reasoning.\n\nIn the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]]-IV (WISC IV),<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wechsler |first1=D. |year=2003 |title=WISC-IV technical and interpretive manual |location=San Antonio, TX |publisher=Psychological Corporation}}{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref> the Perceptual Reasoning Index contains two subtests that assess Gf: Matrix Reasoning, which involves induction and deduction, and Picture Concepts, which involves induction.<ref name=\"Flanagan\">{{cite book |last1=Flanagan |first1=D.

This task assesses the child's ability to discover the underlying characteristic (e.g. rule, concept, trend, class membership) that governs a set of materials. Matrix Reasoning also tests this ability as well as the ability to start with stated rules, premises, or conditions and to engage in one or more steps to reach a solution to a novel problem (deduction). In the Matrix Reasoning test, children are presented a series or sequence of pictures with one picture missing. Their task is to choose the picture that fits the series or sequence from an array of five options. Since Matrix Reasoning and Picture Concepts involve the use of visual stimuli and do not require expressive language, they are considered to be non-verbal tests of Gf.<ref name=\"Flanagan\" />\n\nWithin the corporate environment, fluid intelligence is a predictor of a person's capacity to work well in environments characterised by complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity.

Systems Integrators are usually involved in the selection of instruments and control components from among various [[OEMs]] to determine the specific mix of output, function, interconnection, program storage, controls, and user interfaces required for specific projects.  The integrator is generally responsible for generating the control riser, collaborating with the lighting consultant/ AV consultant on the function programming, and will commission the system once installed.  Often (but not always) the system integrator will also be the vendor for projects they are commissioning, and will collaborate with the lighting designer on the artistic design.

Systems Integrators design many distributed nodes in traditional star or ring topologies, or customize system layout for specific installations.  The network will have a hierarchy of main and sub-control stations with varying degrees of access.  The network can be designed such that the controls for this system can be on an established timeline, or controlled in real time by astronomical clocks, audio/motion/IR sensors, or various means of user interface (buttons, touch-pads, consoles).  This system might utilize a primary controller that can access the entire system, and satellite control interfaces linked via a network backbone that would determine functionality based on access codes.  For example, a casino might use a networked system that interfaces with architectural lighting, stage lighting, special effects (such as fog machines or fountains), and media content routed to a media server.  The primary controller would have access to all devices on the network, while individual control stations could have varying levels of functionality.  A ballroom might have a multi-button panel that would adjust lighting only in that ballroom, while a cabaret space with a stage would require an access code that would give employees access to the stage lighting, while the IT manager could use the same panel to access the main controls for the networks.\n\n== In the automation industry ==\n{{main article|Automation integrator}}\nSystem Integrators in the automation industry typically provide the product and application experience in implementing complex automation solutions.

It is not clear when it was written: according to the composer's letters composition was between July and October 1953, but [[Tatiana Nikolayeva]] stated that it was completed in 1951.

It thus has a significance somewhat comparable to that of the [[Symphony No. 5 (Shostakovich)|Fifth Symphony]] in relation to the 1936 first denunciation. In content and structure, the 10th Symphony is an example of Shostakovich\u2019s synthesis of allusions to the symphonic tradition on the one hand, and encoded references to his own particular time and place on the other.{{according to whom|date=February 2012}}\n\nThe first and longest movement is a slow movement in rough [[sonata form]]. As in his Fifth Symphony, Shostakovich quotes from one of his settings of [[Pushkin]]: in the first movement, from the second of his ''Op. 91: Four Monologues on Verses by Pushkin for bass and piano'' (1952), entitled \"What is in My Name?\". This theme of personal identity is picked up again in the third and fourth movements.\n\nThe second movement is a short and violent [[scherzo]] with syncopated rhythms and endlessly furious semiquaver (sixteenth note) passages. The book ''[[Testimony (Volkov book)|Testimony]]'' claims:\n\n<blockquote>I did depict [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] in my next symphony, the Tenth. I wrote it right after Stalin's death and no one has yet guessed what the symphony is about. It's about Stalin and the Stalin years.  The second part, the scherzo, is a musical portrait of Stalin, roughly speaking. Of course, there are many other things in it, but that's the basis.<ref>{{cite book|title=Testimony: The Memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich |first=Solomon|last= Volkov |authorlink=Solomon Volkov |page=141 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GEApb54v-s4C&pg=PA141& |accessdate= 26 May 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, Shostakovich biographer Laurel Fay wrote, \"I have found no corroboration that such a specific program was either intended or perceived at the time of composition and first performance.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Shostakovich: A Life| first= Laurel E. |last=Fay |page=327 note 14|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SdaiTNy6984C&pg=PA327&lpg=PA327& | accessdate=26 May 2014}}</ref> Musicologist Richard Taruskin called the proposition a \"dubious revelation, which no one had previously suspected either in Russia or in the West\".<ref>{{cite book|title=On Russian Music |first=Richard |last= Taruskin |authorlink=Richard Taruskin |page=327 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vMnkybvtw2IC&pg=PA327&| accessdate=26 May 2014}}</ref>  Elizabeth Wilson adds: \"The Tenth Symphony is often read as the composer\u2019s commentary on the recent Stalinist era. But as so often in Shostakovich\u2019s art, the exposition of external events is counter-opposed to the private world of his innermost feelings.\"<ref>Shostakovich: A Life Remembered, Elizabeth Wilson, p. 305</ref>\n\nThe third movement [[nocturne]] is built around two musical codes: the [[DSCH (Dmitri Shostakovich)|DSCH]] theme representing Shostakovich, and the Elmira theme ({{Audio|Elmira.ogg|listen}}):\n\n[[Image:Elmiramotif.png|798px|The Elmira theme]]\n\nAt concert [[pitch (music)|pitch]] one [[Perfect fifth|fifth]] lower, the notes spell out \"E La Mi Re A\" in a combination of French and German [[Musical notation|notation]]. This [[motif (music)|motif]], called out twelve times on the [[French horn|horn]], represents Elmira Nazirova, a student of the composer with whom he fell in love. The motif is of ambiguous [[tonality]], giving it an air of uncertainty or hollowness.<ref>Nelly Kravetz, ''New Insight into the Tenth Symphony'', p. 162.  In [[Rosamund Bartlett|Bartlett, R.]] (ed) ''Shostakovich in Context''.</ref>\n\nIn a letter to Nazirova, Shostakovich himself noted the similarity of the motif to the [[ape]] call in the first movement of [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'s ''[[Das Lied von der Erde]]'', a work which he had been listening to around that time:<ref>Kravetz p. 163.</ref> ({{Audio|Mahlerape.ogg|listen}})\n\n[[Image:Mahlerape.png|565px|The ape call from the first movement of [[Das Lied von der Erde]]]]\n\nThe same notes are used in both motifs, and both are repeatedly played by the horn. In the [[Chinese poem]] set by Mahler, the ape is a representation of death, while the Elmira motif itself occurs together with the \"funeral knell\" of a [[Gong|tam tam]].<ref>Kravetz p. 162.</ref>\nThere is also more than a passing resemblance of this motif to the slow fanfare theme in the finale of [[Sibelius]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Sibelius)|Fifth Symphony]]; similar instrumentation (horns, woodwinds) is used for the Elmira motif here as in the Sibelius work. Over the course of the movement, the DSCH and Elmira themes alternate and gradually draw closer.\n\nThe third movement is a moderate dance-like suite of Mahlerian ''Nachtmusik'' \u2013 or [[Nocturne]], which is what Shostakovich called it.\n\nIn the fourth and final movement, a naively happy tune at a slow andante pace (again heavily influenced by Mahler) that suddenly changes into a fast finale that has the pace of a doom-laden [[Gopak]],{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} which recalls the second movement theme. The fast theme is in turn defeated by the triumphant DSCH theme, which is repeated with increasing agitation through the frantic conclusion. The coda effects a transition to E Major, and at the very end, several instruments have a glissando from an E to the next E.\n\nThe 10th Symphony is automatically linked to many of Shostakovich\u2019s other works such as the [[Cello Concerto No. 1 (Shostakovich)|Cello Concerto No. 1]] (1959) and notably the [[String Quartet No. 8 (Shostakovich)|String Quartet No. 8]] (1960) because of the use of the [[DSCH (Dmitri Shostakovich)|DSCH]]-motif. The DSCH-motif is anticipated throughout the first movement of the 10th Symphony: In the 7th bar of the start of the symphony the violins doubled by the violas play a D for 5 bars which is then directly followed by an E{{music|flat}}; 9 bars before [[rehearsal mark]] 29 the violins play the motif in an inverted order D-C-H-S (or D-C-B-E{{music|flat}}). The first time the motif is heard in its correct order in the whole symphony is in the 3rd movement, right after a short canon on the beginning melody starting from the 3rd beat of the 5th bar after rehearsal mark 104 ([[Figure (music)|Fig. 11]]) where it is played in unison by the piccolo, the 1st flute and the 1st oboe (compassing a range of three octaves).\n\n==Notable recordings==\n\nRecordings of this symphony include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:900px;\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Orchestra\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Conductor\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Record Company\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Year of Recording\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Format\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||[[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]]\n||[[Dmitri Mitropoulos]]\n||[[CBS]]\n||1954<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Shostakovich-Philharmonic-Symphony-Orchestra-Of-New-York-Dimitri-Mitropoulos-Symphony-No-10-In-E-Min/release/5243947|title=Shostakovich*, Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra Of New York*, Dimitri Mitropoulos \u2013 Symphony No. 10 In E Minor, Op. 93|website=Discogs|access-date=2016-06-02}}</ref>\n||LP\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|[[Czech Philharmonic]]\n|[[Karel An\u010derl]]\n|[[Deutsche Grammophon|DG]]\n|1955\n|LP\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||[[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]]\n||[[Herbert von Karajan]]\n||[[Deutsche Grammophon|DG]]\n||1967<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deutschegrammophon.com/us/cat/4297162|title=SHOSTAKOVICH 10.

Of course, there are many other things in it, but that's the basis.<ref>{{cite book|title=Testimony: The Memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich |first=Solomon|last= Volkov |authorlink=Solomon Volkov |page=141 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GEApb54v-s4C&pg=PA141& |accessdate= 26 May 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, Shostakovich biographer Laurel Fay wrote, \"I have found no corroboration that such a specific program was either intended or perceived at the time of composition and first performance.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Shostakovich: A Life| first= Laurel E. |last=Fay |page=327 note 14|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SdaiTNy6984C&pg=PA327&lpg=PA327& | accessdate=26 May 2014}}</ref> Musicologist Richard Taruskin called the proposition a \"dubious revelation, which no one had previously suspected either in Russia or in the West\".<ref>{{cite book|title=On Russian Music |first=Richard |last= Taruskin |authorlink=Richard Taruskin |page=327 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vMnkybvtw2IC&pg=PA327&| accessdate=26 May 2014}}</ref>  Elizabeth Wilson adds: \"The Tenth Symphony is often read as the composer\u2019s commentary on the recent Stalinist era. But as so often in Shostakovich\u2019s art, the exposition of external events is counter-opposed to the private world of his innermost feelings.\"<ref>Shostakovich: A Life Remembered, Elizabeth Wilson, p. 305</ref>\n\nThe third movement [[nocturne]] is built around two musical codes: the [[DSCH (Dmitri Shostakovich)|DSCH]] theme representing Shostakovich, and the Elmira theme ({{Audio|Elmira.ogg|listen}}):\n\n[[Image:Elmiramotif.png|798px|The Elmira theme]]\n\nAt concert [[pitch (music)|pitch]] one [[Perfect fifth|fifth]] lower, the notes spell out \"E La Mi Re A\" in a combination of French and German [[Musical notation|notation]]. This [[motif (music)|motif]], called out twelve times on the [[French horn|horn]], represents Elmira Nazirova, a student of the composer with whom he fell in love. The motif is of ambiguous [[tonality]], giving it an air of uncertainty or hollowness.<ref>Nelly Kravetz, ''New Insight into the Tenth Symphony'', p. 162.  In [[Rosamund Bartlett|Bartlett, R.]] (ed) ''Shostakovich in Context''.</ref>\n\nIn a letter to Nazirova, Shostakovich himself noted the similarity of the motif to the [[ape]] call in the first movement of [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'s ''[[Das Lied von der Erde]]'', a work which he had been listening to around that time:<ref>Kravetz p. 163.</ref> ({{Audio|Mahlerape.ogg|listen}})\n\n[[Image:Mahlerape.png|565px|The ape call from the first movement of [[Das Lied von der Erde]]]]\n\nThe same notes are used in both motifs, and both are repeatedly played by the horn. In the [[Chinese poem]] set by Mahler, the ape is a representation of death, while the Elmira motif itself occurs together with the \"funeral knell\" of a [[Gong|tam tam]].<ref>Kravetz p. 162.</ref>\nThere is also more than a passing resemblance of this motif to the slow fanfare theme in the finale of [[Sibelius]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Sibelius)|Fifth Symphony]]; similar instrumentation (horns, woodwinds) is used for the Elmira motif here as in the Sibelius work. Over the course of the movement, the DSCH and Elmira themes alternate and gradually draw closer.\n\nThe third movement is a moderate dance-like suite of Mahlerian ''Nachtmusik'' \u2013 or [[Nocturne]], which is what Shostakovich called it.\n\nIn the fourth and final movement, a naively happy tune at a slow andante pace (again heavily influenced by Mahler) that suddenly changes into a fast finale that has the pace of a doom-laden [[Gopak]],{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} which recalls the second movement theme. The fast theme is in turn defeated by the triumphant DSCH theme, which is repeated with increasing agitation through the frantic conclusion. The coda effects a transition to E Major, and at the very end, several instruments have a glissando from an E to the next E.\n\nThe 10th Symphony is automatically linked to many of Shostakovich\u2019s other works such as the [[Cello Concerto No. 1 (Shostakovich)|Cello Concerto No. 1]] (1959) and notably the [[String Quartet No. 8 (Shostakovich)|String Quartet No. 8]] (1960) because of the use of the [[DSCH (Dmitri Shostakovich)|DSCH]]-motif. The DSCH-motif is anticipated throughout the first movement of the 10th Symphony: In the 7th bar of the start of the symphony the violins doubled by the violas play a D for 5 bars which is then directly followed by an E{{music|flat}}; 9 bars before [[rehearsal mark]] 29 the violins play the motif in an inverted order D-C-H-S (or D-C-B-E{{music|flat}}). The first time the motif is heard in its correct order in the whole symphony is in the 3rd movement, right after a short canon on the beginning melody starting from the 3rd beat of the 5th bar after rehearsal mark 104 ([[Figure (music)|Fig. 11]]) where it is played in unison by the piccolo, the 1st flute and the 1st oboe (compassing a range of three octaves).\n\n==Notable recordings==\n\nRecordings of this symphony include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:900px;\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Orchestra\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Conductor\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Record Company\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Year of Recording\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Format\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||[[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]]\n||[[Dmitri Mitropoulos]]\n||[[CBS]]\n||1954<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Shostakovich-Philharmonic-Symphony-Orchestra-Of-New-York-Dimitri-Mitropoulos-Symphony-No-10-In-E-Min/release/5243947|title=Shostakovich*, Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra Of New York*, Dimitri Mitropoulos \u2013 Symphony No. 10 In E Minor, Op. 93|website=Discogs|access-date=2016-06-02}}</ref>\n||LP\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|[[Czech Philharmonic]]\n|[[Karel An\u010derl]]\n|[[Deutsche Grammophon|DG]]\n|1955\n|LP\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||[[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]]\n||[[Herbert von Karajan]]\n||[[Deutsche Grammophon|DG]]\n||1967<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deutschegrammophon.com/us/cat/4297162|title=SHOSTAKOVICH 10.

{"title_page": "Symphony No. 1 (Brahms)", "text_new": "{{short description|Symphony by Johannes Brahms}}\n'''Symphony No. 1 in C minor''', [[Opus number|Op.]] 68, is a [[symphony]] written by [[Johannes Brahms]]. Brahms spent at least fourteen years completing this work, whose sketches date from 1854. Brahms himself declared that the symphony, from sketches to finishing touches, took 21 years, from 1855 to 1876. The premiere of this symphony, conducted by the composer's friend [[Felix Otto Dessoff]], occurred on 4 November 1876, in [[Karlsruhe]], then in the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]]. A typical performance lasts between 45 and 50 minutes.\n\n==History==\nBrahms began composing a D minor symphony in 1854, but this work underwent radical change before much of it was finally recast as his [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Brahms)|first Piano Concerto]], also in D minor.<ref name=\"linernotes\">Leonard Burkat; liner notes for the 1998 recording (William Steinberg, conductor; Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra; MCA Classics)</ref> The long gestation of the C minor Symphony which would eventually be his first, may be attributed to two factors. First, Brahms's self-critical fastidiousness led him to destroy many of his early works. Second, there was an expectation from Brahms's friends and the public that he would continue \"[[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] inheritance\" and produce a symphony of commensurate dignity and intellectual scope \u2013 an expectation that Brahms felt he could not fulfill easily in view of the monumental reputation of Beethoven.\n\nIt was probably 1868 when Brahms finally realized what would become the final structure of his first Symphony. In September of that year, he sent a card to his lifelong friend [[Clara Schumann]] sketching the Alphorn tune which would emerge in the symphony's Finale, along with the famous message \"Thus blew the shepherd's horn today!\" Despite the evidence of the work's development, the symphony would not premiere for eight more years, in 1876.<ref>{{cite book\n| title = Brahms\n| edition = First\n| last = MacDonald\n| first = Malcolm\n| year = 1990\n| publisher = Schirmer Books, A Division of Macmillan, Inc.\n| isbn = 0-02-871393-1\n| page = 246\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Fritz Simrock]], Brahms's friend and publisher, did not receive the score until after the work had been performed in three cities \u2013 and Brahms still wished trial performances in at least three more.\n\nThe manuscript to the first movement apparently does not survive, yet the remainder has been reproduced in miniature facsimile by [[Dover Publications]].

Un poco sostenuto \u2014 Allegro==\nThe first movement is in sonata form with an extended introduction.\n\n===Introduction===\nUnique among Brahms symphonies, the First Symphony is ushered in via a formal introduction (an 1862 score of the symphony originally started with the Allegro section). After a processional opening section featuring chaotic [[syncopated]] rhythms underpinned by pulsating timpani, the woodwinds and [[pizzicato]] strings play with thematic phrases to be fully explored in the following exposition. A short and stormy return to the original development, this time in the [[dominant (music)|dominant]] of G and supported by rolling timpani, is finally followed by further melodic introductions played by oboe, flute and cellos before resolving in a drawn-out {{music|time|9|8}} transitional passage ending with a plucked G note in the cellos.\n\n===Exposition===\nThe exposition begins abruptly, echoing the introduction's plucked final note with an orchestral exclamation, followed by a short motto which leads to the main theme, which is initially played, stridently, by the violins. The overall mood is \"savagely energetic\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=Malcolm|title=Brahms|date=1990|publisher=Schirmer Books|isbn=0-02-871393-1|page=247|edition=First American}}</ref> and \"[[scherzo]]-like\" in {{music|time|6|8}} time. As the responsibility for the main theme shifts from the violins to the woodwinds, the strings and timpani begin to sound out a da-da-da-DUM rhythm which is strongly reminiscent of the \"fate\" rhythm of [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Fifth Symphony]].<ref name=\"kellydeanhansen.com\">{{cite web|last1=Hansen|first1=Kelly Dean|url=http://www.kellydeanhansen.com/opus68.html|title=Symphony No. 1 in C Minor, Op. 68 |website=Listening Guides to the Works of Johannes Brahms|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nAn extended transition leads to the arrival of the key of E{{music|b}} major which in turn introduces the flowing and heart-easing second theme. This theme, which is related to the motto used to open the movement, is carried out in the wind section, led by oboe and clarinet with support from the bassoon and eventually the French horns. Strong intervention from the violas ends this peaceful passage with a descending minor key sequence which opens to a new closing theme leading up to a final bombastic passage wrapping up the exposition. The score then calls for a full repeat, which requires an abrupt return to C minor.\n\n===Development===\nThe action in the development section begins with a full step descent into B major, and instability ensues as interplay between the \"fate\" [[Motif (music)|motif]] and phrases from the original theme are played off each other. A series of [[modulation (music)|modulations]], each seeming to lead further away from the tonic, eventually leads the path back to the recapitulation. Starting with a murky rumble in the basses, the music gathers strength with a thrilling set of arpeggios in the violins with support from the brass, which repeat the \"fate\" motif with great alacrity. Finally, a \"shocking digression\"<ref name=\"kellydeanhansen.com\" /> in the bass line leads to a modulation to F{{music|#}}, setting the stage for the recapitulation.\n\n===Recapitulation and coda===\nA somewhat nebulous start to the recapitulation is followed by a foreshortened restatement of the first theme, allowing the music to proceed in the tonic, rather than taking up the tonal progressions originally followed in the exposition. The coda begins with pizzicato strings which quickly [[decrescendo]], leading to a set of modulations played out in the strings with their bows leading to the closing cadence. The movement ends peacefully in C major.\n\n==II. Andante sostenuto==\nThe E-major second movement is in modified [[ternary form]] (A\u2013B\u2013A). It features significant solo passages from oboe and first chair violin.\n\n==III. Un poco allegretto e grazioso==\nLike the second movement, the third movement is in ternary form. It is composed of the {{music|time|2|4}} [[Allegretto]] and contrasting {{music|time|6|8}} trio section, followed by a reprise of the Allegretto material and [[Coda (music)|coda]]. A notable aspect of this movement is Brahms\u2019s careful attention to [[Symmetry (music)|symmetry]].\n\nThe form could be described as:\n:A B A<sub>1</sub> B<sub>1</sub> C D C<sub>1</sub> D<sub>1</sub> A<sub>2</sub> \u2013 trio \u2013 A<sub>3</sub> B<sub>2</sub> A<sub>4</sub> \u2013 coda\n\n===Allegretto===\n[[File:Brahms 1-III theme a.png|thumb|350px|The A theme as stated by the clarinet]]\nThe Allegretto is in the key of A{{music|b}} major and begins with a calm, stepwise melody in the clarinet. The four-bar figure is extended to an irregular five bars through a small bridge between the phrases by the strings. The clarinet rounds off the A theme in the Allegretto with an [[Melodic inversion|inversion]] of the first five bars heard.\n\n[[File:Brahms 1-III theme b.png|thumb|350px|The B theme as stated by the flutes]]\nThe B theme enters in measure 11 and features a descending [[Dot (music)|dotted]]-[[eighth-note]] pattern in the flute, clarinet, and bassoon with the strings echoing the rhythm in rising and falling figures. After eight measures, A<sub>1</sub> appears with the violins iterating the first theme and a longer, [[chromatic (music)|chromatic]] bridge section that extends the phrase structure to seven bars. B<sub>1</sub> is presented with an extension into C.\n\nThe C and D themes differ from the first two in that they are shorter and more angular rhythmically. The A and B themes feature an almost constant eighth-note [[pizzicato]] in the strings, whereas C and D are more complex with an interlocking [[sixteenth-note]] pattern accompanying the winds. Movement from the major mode to F minor also marks these sections as apart from preceding material. This obvious contrast in character and mood can lend one to think of the C and D sections as a sort of trio within the first Allegretto section in the larger ternary form displayed by the movement as a whole.<ref>{{Citation |last=Frisch |first=Walter |title=Brahms: The Four Symphonies |series=Yale Music Masterworks |origyear=1996 |year=2003 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven and London |isbn=0-300-09965-7 |oclc=2003104448 |page=[https://archive.org/details/brahmsfoursympho00fris/page/56 56] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/brahmsfoursympho00fris/page/56 }}</ref> The symmetry within one section reflects the symmetry of the whole.\n\nA<sub>2</sub> closes off the first major section with the clarinet stating the first theme, much as it did in the beginning, finishing with a transition to the trio.\n\n===Trio===\n[[File:Brahms 1-III trio theme.png|thumb|350px|The trio theme]]\nThe Trio offers a change of key, as well as a change of time. The key moves to B major, an [[enharmonic]] [[minor third]] away from A{{music|b}}. This key movement balances with the C and D sections in F minor, also a minor third away from the home key but in the opposite direction. The time signature changes from a stately {{music|time|2|4}} to a more pastoral and dancelike {{music|time|6|8}}. The flute, oboe, and bassoon introduce a joyful melody in stepwise motion as in the A theme. The strings add a downward three-note [[arpeggio]]. These two motives make up the bulk of the trio material. Restatement and development of those themes ensue until the brass and winds join together for a final repeat of the melody. The second ending brings the orchestra back into {{music|time|2|4}} time and to A<sub>3</sub>.\n\n===Return of the Allegretto===\nA major difference between A<sub>3</sub> and the earlier iterations of A is the lingering effect of the trio upon the movement. The monotone call from the opening of the trio melody appears over the clarinet melody in the flute, oboe, and bassoon. The rhythmic effect of triplets also invades the pure eighth-note world of the A theme, producing [[polyrhythms]]. Instead of the [[Melodic inversion|inversion]] of the theme we expect in the second phrase of A, the strings take over and offer an entirely different melody, but with essentially the same contour as the inversion. B<sub>2</sub> occupies a significantly larger space of the reprise than it does in the previous Allegretto. It leads through an extended transition to the last, quiet statement of A in unison by the strings. Strings of dotted eighth notes end the movement proper with ideas from the B theme.\n\n===Coda===\nThe entry to the coda is marked ''poco a poco pi\u00f9 tranquillo'' and the movement ends with the gentle throbbing of triplets quoted from the trio section. The final few bars end somewhat abruptly with the downward arpeggio of the strings in the trio finishing on the downbeat of a new bar.\n\n==IV. Adagio \u2014 Pi\u00f9 andante \u2014 Allegro non troppo, ma con brio \u2014 Pi\u00f9 allegro==\nAs with the first movement, Brahms begins the final movement with a formal introduction in C minor. The finale, noted for its \"vast scope\"...\"resolves all the tensions that the first movement had raised but was (magnificently) unable to dissipate.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=Malcolm|title=Brahms|date=1990|publisher=Schirmer Books|isbn=0-02-871393-1|page=247|edition=First American}}</ref> Except for the cut-time ({{music|alla-breve}}) Pi\u00f9 allegro coda, the movement is in common ({{music|common-time}}) meter.\n\n===Introduction (Adagio \u2014 Pi\u00f9 andante)===\nPART I (Adagio - C minor). The extended introduction begins with a murky and ominous descending four-note sequence in the strings, which is followed by a tragically-rendered \"anticipation\" of the movement's joyous '[[Alphorn]]' theme<ref name=\"kellydeanhansen.com\" />. This is followed by a passage of pizzicato string notes, plucked in two-note groups passed between the high- and low-pitched instrument sections, which rises in tempo and volume until the prior tragic theme re-emerges in a short reprise. This is followed by a second passage of pizzicato strings, which is resolved in a sudden shift to a rising set of modulations in the woodwinds followed by a set of rapid arpeggios in the strings leading to the grand entrance of the Alphorn theme in C major.\n\nPART II (Pi\u00f9 andante - C major). The horns, including the first entry of the trombones, introduce the Alphorn theme with a \"noble and grand presentation\" over a \"shimmering cloudscape\" of strings<ref name=\"kellydeanhansen.com\"/>, in \"one of the classic orchestral moments of the nineteenth century\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=Malcolm|title=Brahms|date=1990|publisher=Schirmer Books|isbn=0-02-871393-1|page=251|edition=First American}}</ref> As the horns conclude the performance of the Alphorn tune, it is given to the flutes to recite. This leads to a mellow chorale in the brass, to be concluded with the transition to the exposition. The first three notes of the Alphorn theme create are presented in a swelling crescendo which resolves in a drawn out conclusion over pounding timpani followed by a quiet chord dying in the brass.\n\n===Exposition===\nThe main theme commences immediately in C major, a \"famous, grandly striding tune\" which was likened by many to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony \"Freude\" theme. This was an assertion which irritated Brahms, but which he nevertheless acknowledged--\"any ass can see that\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=Malcolm|title=Brahms|date=1990|publisher=Schirmer Books|isbn=0-02-871393-1|page=247|edition=First American}}</ref> The theme is introduced in the violins and violas in alto register accompanied softly by horns and underpinned by pizzicato bass. After a few bars, the strings undulate through the second phrase with support from the bassoons. The woodwinds then pick up the song, with the strings in pizzicato accompaniment with gently trilling timpani. Finally, the full orchestra is unleashed in an energetic rendition which quickly fragments into transitional struggle. A passage led by arpeggio strings accompanied by bassoon and contrabassoon follows, including a brief variation of the Alphorn tune leading directly to the second theme.\n\nThe second theme arrives as a falling four note figure related to the opening sequence and related to the Alphorn tune. The theme is introduced softly in the low strings, and elaborated upon by the violins. The second statement of the theme is joined first by the bassoons, followed by the flutes and oboes. After an energetic transitional passage in the strings, the oboe continues with an inverted variation of the theme in G major but eventually modulates back to E minor, leading to the conclusion of the exposition.\n\n===Development/Recapitulation===\nThe development section begins with a full restatement of the movement's main theme; the last time it will be heard in its entirety. The development section in fact provides a full recapitulation of both of the symphony's main themes and leads directly to the movement's coda; there is no separate recapitulation section in the movement.\n\nThe recapitulation of the main theme is 'richly scored', with full strings carrying the tune supported by 'punctuating chords' in the winds and gently rolling timpani. The oboe leads a transition to E-flat and a development-heavy section marked by key instability and fragmented restatements and elaborations of phrases in the melody. These are parried between the winds, led by flutes, and (softly) by the horns and bassoons with pizzicato strings providing additional momentum. An energetic restatement of the theme by the orchestra follows, but this quickly digresses into a transitional section marked by string arpeggios and the arrival of a new thematic element for further development.\n\nA distinctive 'turning' [[Motif_(music)|motif]], derived from the main theme, appears in the winds, traded between flute and oboe with lush string harmony accompaniment. This is followed by an energetic passage, mainly in the strings, featuring falling arpeggio figures and elements of the main theme recited in C minor/F minor.<ref name=\"kellydeanhansen.com\" />\n\nThe turning motif returns in a thrilling rendition led by the horns, followed by powerful syncopated descending figures which are traded between the strings and the wind instruments. This finally leads back to a rendition of the Alphorn theme, which begins tragically in the strings, but is recovered by a soothing harmonic motion initiated in the winds and followed by a major key restatement in the horns, this time without the shimmering strings of the exposition. The music begins to lose momentum as the strings play a descending procession that sounds as if it may lead to closing material for the section. \n\nInstead, the second theme immediately follows in a full recapitulation, which is restated with little change from its original appearance in the exposition. However, after the theme's restatement is complete, a subtle change in the final passage avoids the key modulation taken in the exposition section, which allows the section to end in C minor. A lengthy coda follows without pause, which returns to C major, restates the chorale from the introduction, and ends with a triumphant pair of [[plagal cadence|plagal cadences]].\n\n==Reception==\nThe value and importance of Brahms's achievements were recognized by [[Vienna]]'s most powerful critic, the staunchly conservative [[Eduard Hanslick]].<ref name=\"linernotes\" /> The conductor [[Hans von B\u00fclow]] was moved in 1877 to call the symphony \"Beethoven's Tenth\", due to perceived similarities between the work and various compositions of Beethoven.<ref>{{cite book\n| title = The Lives of the Great Composers\n| edition = Revised\n| last = Schonberg\n| first = Harold C.|authorlink=Harold C.

Also, Brahms uses the rhythm of the \"fate\" motto from the opening of Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]. This rather annoyed Brahms; he felt that this amounted to accusations of plagiarism, whereas he saw his use of Beethoven's idiom in this symphony as an act of conscious homage. Brahms himself said, when comment was made on the similarity with Beethoven, \"any [[wikt:ass#Etymology 1|ass]] can see that\".<ref>[http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/?fuseaction=composition&composition_id=2650 Symphony No. 1 in C minor, Op. 68].

This introduction was constructed after the remainder of the piece had been scored. The Allegro section of the movement is a large orchestral [[sonata]], wherein musical ideas are stated, developed, and restated with altered relationships among them.\n\nThe second and third movements are lighter in tone and tension than the first and last movements. The slow movement, Andante sostenuto, exhibits gentle lyricism through three sections, the third of which is a new treatment of the themes from the first. The long violin solo is reminiscent of some of Beethoven's later works: [[Late String Quartets (Beethoven)|the late quartets]] and ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]''. The third, [[scherzo]]-like movement, has an easy spirit yet is full of complex rhythms and interwoven textures.\n\nThe fourth movement begins with a slow introduction, where a new melody competes with \"gloomy dramatic rhetoric\".<ref name=\"linernotes\" /> In the ''Pi\u00f9 andante'' section, the horns and timpani introduce a tune that Brahms heard from an Alpine shepherd with the words, \"High on the hill, deep in the dale, I send you a thousand greetings!\"<ref name=\"linernotes\" /> This movement contains melodies reminiscent of Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]]. The last section\u2014Allegro non troppo, ma con brio\u2014contains a grand melody in a major key, as the novel, Beethoven-like main subject of the grand finale.\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n*Brahms, Johannes.

Brahms spent at least fourteen years completing this work, whose sketches date from 1854. Brahms himself declared that the symphony, from sketches to finishing touches, took 21 years, from 1855 to 1876. The premiere of this symphony, conducted by the composer's friend [[Felix Otto Dessoff]], occurred on 4 November 1876, in [[Karlsruhe]], then in the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]]. A typical performance lasts between 45 and 50 minutes.\n\n==History==\nBrahms began composing a D minor symphony in 1854, but this work underwent radical change before much of it was finally recast as his [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Brahms)|first Piano Concerto]], also in D minor.<ref name=\"linernotes\">Leonard Burkat; liner notes for the 1998 recording (William Steinberg, conductor; Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra; MCA Classics)</ref> The long gestation of the C minor Symphony which would eventually be his first, may be attributed to two factors. First, Brahms's self-critical fastidiousness led him to destroy many of his early works. Second, there was an expectation from Brahms's friends and the public that he would continue \"[[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] inheritance\" and produce a symphony of commensurate dignity and intellectual scope \u2013 an expectation that Brahms felt he could not fulfill easily in view of the monumental reputation of Beethoven.\n\nIt was probably 1868 when Brahms finally realized what would become the final structure of his first Symphony. In September of that year, he sent a card to his lifelong friend [[Clara Schumann]] sketching the Alphorn tune which would emerge in the symphony's Finale, along with the famous message \"Thus blew the shepherd's horn today!\" Despite the evidence of the work's development, the symphony would not premiere for eight more years, in 1876.<ref>{{cite book\n| title = Brahms\n| edition = First\n| last = MacDonald\n| first = Malcolm\n| year = 1990\n| publisher = Schirmer Books, A Division of Macmillan, Inc.\n| isbn = 0-02-871393-1\n| page = 246\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Fritz Simrock]], Brahms's friend and publisher, did not receive the score until after the work had been performed in three cities \u2013 and Brahms still wished trial performances in at least three more.\n\nThe manuscript to the first movement apparently does not survive, yet the remainder has been reproduced in miniature facsimile by [[Dover Publications]].

Un poco sostenuto \u2014 Allegro==\nThe first movement is in sonata form with an extended introduction.\n\n===Introduction===\nUnique among Brahms symphonies, the First Symphony is ushered in via a formal introduction (an 1862 score of the symphony originally started with the Allegro section). After a processional opening section featuring chaotic [[syncopated]] rhythms underpinned by pulsating timpani, the woodwinds and [[pizzicato]] strings play with thematic phrases to be fully explored in the following exposition. A short and stormy return to the original development, this time in the [[dominant (music)|dominant]] of G and supported by rolling timpani, is finally followed by further melodic introductions played by oboe, flute and cellos before resolving in a drawn-out {{music|time|9|8}} transitional passage ending with a plucked G note in the cellos.\n\n===Exposition===\nThe exposition begins abruptly, echoing the introduction's plucked final note with an orchestral exclamation, followed by a short motto which leads to the main theme, which is initially played, stridently, by the violins. The overall mood is \"savagely energetic\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=Malcolm|title=Brahms|date=1990|publisher=Schirmer Books|isbn=0-02-871393-1|page=247|edition=First American}}</ref> and \"[[scherzo]]-like\" in {{music|time|6|8}} time. As the responsibility for the main theme shifts from the violins to the woodwinds, the strings and timpani begin to sound out a da-da-da-DUM rhythm which is strongly reminiscent of the \"fate\" rhythm of [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Fifth Symphony]].<ref name=\"kellydeanhansen.com\">{{cite web|last1=Hansen|first1=Kelly Dean|url=http://www.kellydeanhansen.com/opus68.html|title=Symphony No. 1 in C Minor, Op. 68 |website=Listening Guides to the Works of Johannes Brahms|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nAn extended transition leads to the arrival of the key of E{{music|b}} major which in turn introduces the flowing and heart-easing second theme. This theme, which is related to the motto used to open the movement, is carried out in the wind section, led by oboe and clarinet with support from the bassoon and eventually the French horns. Strong intervention from the violas ends this peaceful passage with a descending minor key sequence which opens to a new closing theme leading up to a final bombastic passage wrapping up the exposition. The score then calls for a full repeat, which requires an abrupt return to C minor.\n\n===Development===\nThe action in the development section begins with a full step descent into B major, and instability ensues as interplay between the \"fate\" [[Motif (music)|motif]] and phrases from the original theme are played off each other. A series of [[modulation (music)|modulations]], each seeming to lead further away from the tonic, eventually leads the path back to the recapitulation. Starting with a murky rumble in the basses, the music gathers strength with a thrilling set of arpeggios in the violins with support from the brass, which repeat the \"fate\" motif with great alacrity. Finally, a \"shocking digression\"<ref name=\"kellydeanhansen.com\" /> in the bass line leads to a modulation to F{{music|#}}, setting the stage for the recapitulation.\n\n===Recapitulation and coda===\nA somewhat nebulous start to the recapitulation is followed by a foreshortened restatement of the first theme, allowing the music to proceed in the tonic, rather than taking up the tonal progressions originally followed in the exposition. The coda begins with pizzicato strings which quickly [[decrescendo]], leading to a set of modulations played out in the strings with their bows leading to the closing cadence. The movement ends peacefully in C major.\n\n==II. Andante sostenuto==\nThe E-major second movement is in modified [[ternary form]] (A\u2013B\u2013A). It features significant solo passages from oboe and first chair violin.\n\n==III. Un poco allegretto e grazioso==\nLike the second movement, the third movement is in ternary form. It is composed of the {{music|time|2|4}} [[Allegretto]] and contrasting {{music|time|6|8}} trio section, followed by a reprise of the Allegretto material and [[Coda (music)|coda]]. A notable aspect of this movement is Brahms\u2019s careful attention to [[Symmetry (music)|symmetry]].\n\nThe form could be described as:\n:A B A<sub>1</sub> B<sub>1</sub> C D C<sub>1</sub> D<sub>1</sub> A<sub>2</sub> \u2013 trio \u2013 A<sub>3</sub> B<sub>2</sub> A<sub>4</sub> \u2013 coda\n\n===Allegretto===\n[[File:Brahms 1-III theme a.png|thumb|350px|The A theme as stated by the clarinet]]\nThe Allegretto is in the key of A{{music|b}} major and begins with a calm, stepwise melody in the clarinet. The four-bar figure is extended to an irregular five bars through a small bridge between the phrases by the strings. The clarinet rounds off the A theme in the Allegretto with an [[Melodic inversion|inversion]] of the first five bars heard.\n\n[[File:Brahms 1-III theme b.png|thumb|350px|The B theme as stated by the flutes]]\nThe B theme enters in measure 11 and features a descending [[Dot (music)|dotted]]-[[eighth-note]] pattern in the flute, clarinet, and bassoon with the strings echoing the rhythm in rising and falling figures. After eight measures, A<sub>1</sub> appears with the violins iterating the first theme and a longer, [[chromatic (music)|chromatic]] bridge section that extends the phrase structure to seven bars. B<sub>1</sub> is presented with an extension into C.\n\nThe C and D themes differ from the first two in that they are shorter and more angular rhythmically. The A and B themes feature an almost constant eighth-note [[pizzicato]] in the strings, whereas C and D are more complex with an interlocking [[sixteenth-note]] pattern accompanying the winds. Movement from the major mode to F minor also marks these sections as apart from preceding material. This obvious contrast in character and mood can lend one to think of the C and D sections as a sort of trio within the first Allegretto section in the larger ternary form displayed by the movement as a whole.<ref>{{Citation |last=Frisch |first=Walter |title=Brahms: The Four Symphonies |series=Yale Music Masterworks |origyear=1996 |year=2003 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven and London |isbn=0-300-09965-7 |oclc=2003104448 |page=[https://archive.org/details/brahmsfoursympho00fris/page/56 56] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/brahmsfoursympho00fris/page/56 }}</ref> The symmetry within one section reflects the symmetry of the whole.\n\nA<sub>2</sub> closes off the first major section with the clarinet stating the first theme, much as it did in the beginning, finishing with a transition to the trio.\n\n===Trio===\n[[File:Brahms 1-III trio theme.png|thumb|350px|The trio theme]]\nThe Trio offers a change of key, as well as a change of time. The key moves to B major, an [[enharmonic]] [[minor third]] away from A{{music|b}}. This key movement balances with the C and D sections in F minor, also a minor third away from the home key but in the opposite direction. The time signature changes from a stately {{music|time|2|4}} to a more pastoral and dancelike {{music|time|6|8}}. The flute, oboe, and bassoon introduce a joyful melody in stepwise motion as in the A theme. The strings add a downward three-note [[arpeggio]]. These two motives make up the bulk of the trio material. Restatement and development of those themes ensue until the brass and winds join together for a final repeat of the melody. The second ending brings the orchestra back into {{music|time|2|4}} time and to A<sub>3</sub>.\n\n===Return of the Allegretto===\nA major difference between A<sub>3</sub> and the earlier iterations of A is the lingering effect of the trio upon the movement. The monotone call from the opening of the trio melody appears over the clarinet melody in the flute, oboe, and bassoon. The rhythmic effect of triplets also invades the pure eighth-note world of the A theme, producing [[polyrhythms]]. Instead of the [[Melodic inversion|inversion]] of the theme we expect in the second phrase of A, the strings take over and offer an entirely different melody, but with essentially the same contour as the inversion. B<sub>2</sub> occupies a significantly larger space of the reprise than it does in the previous Allegretto. It leads through an extended transition to the last, quiet statement of A in unison by the strings. Strings of dotted eighth notes end the movement proper with ideas from the B theme.\n\n===Coda===\nThe entry to the coda is marked ''poco a poco pi\u00f9 tranquillo'' and the movement ends with the gentle throbbing of triplets quoted from the trio section. The final few bars end somewhat abruptly with the downward arpeggio of the strings in the trio finishing on the downbeat of a new bar.\n\n==IV. Adagio \u2014 Pi\u00f9 andante \u2014 Allegro non troppo, ma con brio \u2014 Pi\u00f9 allegro==\nAs with the first movement, Brahms begins the final movement with a formal introduction in C minor. The finale, noted for its \"vast scope\"...\"resolves all the tensions that the first movement had raised but was (magnificently) unable to dissipate.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=Malcolm|title=Brahms|date=1990|publisher=Schirmer Books|isbn=0-02-871393-1|page=247|edition=First American}}</ref> Except for the cut-time ({{music|alla-breve}}) Pi\u00f9 allegro coda, the movement is in common ({{music|common-time}}) meter.\n\n===Introduction (Adagio \u2014 Pi\u00f9 andante)===\nPART I (Adagio - C minor). The extended introduction begins with a murky and ominous descending four-note sequence in the strings, which is followed by a tragically-rendered \"anticipation\" of the movement's joyous '[[Alphorn]]' theme<ref name=\"kellydeanhansen.com\" />. This is followed by a passage of pizzicato string notes, plucked in two-note groups passed between the high- and low-pitched instrument sections, which rises in tempo and volume until the prior tragic theme re-emerges in a short reprise. This is followed by a second passage of pizzicato strings, which is resolved in a sudden shift to a rising set of modulations in the woodwinds followed by a set of rapid arpeggios in the strings leading to the grand entrance of the Alphorn theme in C major.\n\nPART II (Pi\u00f9 andante - C major). The horns, including the first entry of the trombones, introduce the Alphorn theme with a \"noble and grand presentation\" over a \"shimmering cloudscape\" of strings<ref name=\"kellydeanhansen.com\"/>, in \"one of the classic orchestral moments of the nineteenth century\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=Malcolm|title=Brahms|date=1990|publisher=Schirmer Books|isbn=0-02-871393-1|page=251|edition=First American}}</ref>. As the horns conclude the performance of the Alphorn tune, it is given to the flutes to recite. This leads to a mellow chorale in the brass, to be concluded with the transition to the exposition. The first three notes of the Alphorn theme create are presented in a swelling crescendo which resolves in a drawn out conclusion over pounding timpani followed by a quiet chord dying in the brass.\n\n===Exposition===\nThe main theme commences immediately in C major, a \"famous, grandly striding tune\" which was likened by many to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony \"Freude\" theme. This was an assertion which irritated Brahms, but which he nevertheless acknowledged--\"any ass can see that\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=Malcolm|title=Brahms|date=1990|publisher=Schirmer Books|isbn=0-02-871393-1|page=247|edition=First American}}</ref> The theme is introduced in the violins and violas in alto register accompanied softly by horns and underpinned by pizzicato bass. After a few bars, the strings undulate through the second phrase with support from the bassoons. The woodwinds then pick up the song, with the strings in pizzicato accompaniment with gently trilling timpani. Finally, the full orchestra is unleashed in an energetic rendition which quickly fragments into transitional struggle. A passage led by arpeggio strings accompanied by bassoon and contrabassoon follows, including a brief variation of the Alphorn tune leading directly to the second theme.\n\nThe second theme arrives as a falling four note figure related to the opening sequence and related to the Alphorn tune. The theme is introduced softly in the low strings, and elaborated upon by the violins. The second statement of the theme is joined first by the bassoons, followed by the flutes and oboes. After an energetic transitional passage in the strings, the oboe continues with an inverted variation of the theme in G major but eventually modulates back to E minor, leading to the conclusion of the exposition.\n\n===Development/Recapitulation===\nThe development section begins with a full restatement of the movement's main theme; the last time it will be heard in its entirety. The development section in fact provides a full recapitulation of both of the symphony's main themes and leads directly to the movement's coda; there is no separate recapitulation section in the movement.\n\nThe recapitulation of the main theme is 'richly scored', with full strings carrying the tune supported by 'punctuating chords' in the winds and gently rolling timpani. The oboe leads a transition to E-flat and a development-heavy section marked by key instability and fragmented restatements and elaborations of phrases in the melody. These are parried between the winds, led by flutes, and (softly) by the horns and bassoons with pizzicato strings providing additional momentum. An energetic restatement of the theme by the orchestra follows, but this quickly digresses into a transitional section marked by string arpeggios and the arrival of a new thematic element for further development.\n\nA distinctive 'turning' [[Motif_(music)|motif]], derived from the main theme, appears in the winds, traded between flute and oboe with lush string harmony accompaniment. This is followed by an energetic passage, mainly in the strings, featuring falling arpeggio figures and elements of the main theme recited in C minor/F minor.<ref name=\"kellydeanhansen.com\" />\n\nThe turning motif returns in a thrilling rendition led by the horns, followed by powerful syncopated descending figures which are traded between the strings and the wind instruments. This finally leads back to a rendition of the Alphorn theme, which begins tragically in the strings, but is recovered by a soothing harmonic motion initiated in the winds and followed by a major key restatement in the horns, this time without the shimmering strings of the exposition. The music begins to lose momentum as the strings play a descending procession that sounds as if it may lead to closing material for the section. \n\nInstead, the second theme immediately follows in a full recapitulation, which is restated with little change from its original appearance in the exposition. However, after the theme's restatement is complete, a subtle change in the final passage avoids the key modulation taken in the exposition section, which allows the section to end in C minor. A lengthy coda follows without pause, which returns to C major, restates the chorale from the introduction, and ends with a triumphant pair of [[plagal cadence|plagal cadences]].\n\n==Reception==\nThe value and importance of Brahms's achievements were recognized by [[Vienna]]'s most powerful critic, the staunchly conservative [[Eduard Hanslick]].<ref name=\"linernotes\" /> The conductor [[Hans von B\u00fclow]] was moved in 1877 to call the symphony \"Beethoven's Tenth\", due to perceived similarities between the work and various compositions of Beethoven.<ref>{{cite book\n| title = The Lives of the Great Composers\n| edition = Revised\n| last = Schonberg\n| first = Harold C.|authorlink=Harold C.

Also, Brahms uses the rhythm of the \"fate\" motto from the opening of Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]. This rather annoyed Brahms; he felt that this amounted to accusations of plagiarism, whereas he saw his use of Beethoven's idiom in this symphony as an act of conscious homage. Brahms himself said, when comment was made on the similarity with Beethoven, \"any [[wikt:ass#Etymology 1|ass]] can see that\".<ref>[http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/?fuseaction=composition&composition_id=2650 Symphony No. 1 in C minor, Op. 68].

This introduction was constructed after the remainder of the piece had been scored. The Allegro section of the movement is a large orchestral [[sonata]], wherein musical ideas are stated, developed, and restated with altered relationships among them.\n\nThe second and third movements are lighter in tone and tension than the first and last movements. The slow movement, Andante sostenuto, exhibits gentle lyricism through three sections, the third of which is a new treatment of the themes from the first. The long violin solo is reminiscent of some of Beethoven's later works: [[Late String Quartets (Beethoven)|the late quartets]] and ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]''. The third, [[scherzo]]-like movement, has an easy spirit yet is full of complex rhythms and interwoven textures.\n\nThe fourth movement begins with a slow introduction, where a new melody competes with \"gloomy dramatic rhetoric\".<ref name=\"linernotes\" /> In the ''Pi\u00f9 andante'' section, the horns and timpani introduce a tune that Brahms heard from an Alpine shepherd with the words, \"High on the hill, deep in the dale, I send you a thousand greetings!\"<ref name=\"linernotes\" /> This movement contains melodies reminiscent of Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]]. The last section\u2014Allegro non troppo, ma con brio\u2014contains a grand melody in a major key, as the novel, Beethoven-like main subject of the grand finale.\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n*Brahms, Johannes.

The airport served more than 5.3 million passengers in 2017.\n\n==History==\n\nSyamsudin Noor Airport was originally named the Airports Ulin managed by the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Government of Occupied Japan]] and is adjacent to the South of the current airport. Because it was heavily damaged by bombing by the allies, the Japanese occupation in 1944 to build a new runway parallel to the northern side of the runway being used now.\n\nIn 1948 the [[Netherlands Indies Civil Administration|Dutch government (NICA)]] to continue the construction of the runway with a 10&nbsp;cm thick stone hardening. At the time of the recognition of the sovereignty of [[Republik Indonesia Serikat|RIS]], airfield management ironwood conducted by the Local Government / Public Works Department. Furthermore, the Indonesian government in 1961, management is delegated to the [[Ministry of Transportation (Indonesia)|Ministry of Transportation]], Bureau of Civil Aviation. In 1970, Airports Ulin renamed Airports Syamsudin Noor after an Indonesian aviation hero from [[South Kalimantan|south kalimantan]], Syamsudin Noor<small>([[:id:Syamsudin Noor|id]])</small>. and in 1974 enhanced the ability of its runway constructed to accommodate other aircraft [[Fokker F28 Fellowship|Fokker-28]].\n\nFrom 1975 until 1977 built a new runway being used now, which is able to accommodate aircraft type [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|DC-9]] is limited.\n\nBased on the Joint Decree of Minister of Defense and Security / Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Transportation and Minister of Finance with No. KEP/30/IX/1975, No. KM/598/5/Phb-75 and No.KEP.927.A/MK/8/1975, concerning set Airports Syamsudin Noor as a civilian airfield fully occupied by the Department of Transportation.\n\nBy virtue of Decree No. KM.213 / HK207 / the un-85, dated 4 November 1985 on the term airport Syamsudin Noor converted into SYAMSUDIN NOOR AIRPORT.\n\nBased on Government Regulation No. 48 of 1992 of 12 April 1992 on the Handover Operations Management Forum Syamsudin Noor Airport to the [[Angkasa Pura|Angkasa Pura I]] and officially Syamsudin Noor Airport Banjarmasin become one of the branches of Perum Angkasa Pura I. Then, based on Government Regulation No. 5 of 1993 dated 2 January 1993, the form of companies Angkasa Pura I changed from Perum Angkasa Pura I became PT. (Persero) Angkasa Pura I.\n\nThrough the development of upgrading the runway in 1994 Syamsudin Noor Airport has been able to accommodate aircraft [[Boeing 737|B-737/300]] at full capacity and the Year 2003 has completed development Syamsudin Noor Airport by the government of South Kalimantan to build a facility extension of Runway to accommodate planes [[Boeing 767|B-767/300 ER]] but its capacity is limited and the construction of apron that can accommodate seven wide-body aircraft B-737 and other supporting facilities. Syamsudin Noor Airport development in order to realize the ideals of South Kalimantan society to make Pride Airport South Kalimantan have become embarkation Hajj.\n==Development and Expansion==\nThe airport has an area of 257 hectares. The airport began operations in 1936 under the name Ulin Intl. In 1975 the airport was officially designated as a civilian airport and renamed to  Syamsudin Noor Airport.  After the completion of the expansion in 2004,  the airport terminal can accommodate 12 aircraft including four Boeing 767-300ER. Historically, Boeing 767-300ER is the first wide-body aircraft which landed on this airport in 2004.\n\nAs the airport was running overcapacity, further development and expansion was required. In early 2013, this airport served 5.5 million passengers, whereas the capacity was only for 4.0 million passengers. In August 2012, about 58 hectares of 102 hectares (57%) of the land needed for the expansion had been acquired.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/83918/land-cleared-for-s-kalimantan-airport-expansion |title=Land cleared for S.
