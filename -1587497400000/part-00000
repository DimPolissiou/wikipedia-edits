Billy Graham conducted 417 crusades in 185 countries and territories on six continents. The first Billy Graham evangelistic campaign, held September 13\u201321, 1947, in the Civic Auditorium in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was attended by 6,000 people. He would rent a large venue, such as a stadium, park, or street. As the sessions became larger, he arranged a group of up to 5,000 people to sing in a choir. He would preach the [[gospel]] and invite people to come forward to ask Jesus to be their saviour and pray together. The inquirers were often given a copy of the [[Gospel of John]] or a [[Bible]] study booklet. In [[Durban]], South Africa, in 1973, the crowd of some 100,000 was the first large mixed-race event in [[apartheid]] South Africa.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cswc.div.ed.ac.uk/2018/03/billy-graham-1918-2018-prophet-of-world-christianity/|title=Billy Graham (1918\u20132018): Prophet of World Christianity?|last=Stanley|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Stanley (historian)|date=March 2, 2018|website=Centre for the Study of World Christianity|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 13, 2020}}</ref> In [[Moscow]], in 1992, one-quarter of the 155,000 people in Graham's audience went forward at his call.<ref name=\"time1993\">Nancy Gibbs & Richard N.

Billy Graham conducted 417 crusades in 185 countries and territories on six continents. The first Billy Graham evangelistic campaign, held September 13\u201321, 1947, in the Civic Auditorium in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was attended by 6,000 people. He would rent a large venue, such as a stadium, park, or street. As the sessions became larger, he arranged a group of up to 5,000 people to sing in a choir. He would preach the [[gospel]] and invite people to come forward to ask Jesus to be their saviour and pray together. The inquirers were often given a copy of the [[Gospel of John]] or a [[Bible]] study booklet. In [[Durban]], South Africa, in 1973, the crowd of some 100,000 was the first large mixed-race event in [[apartheid]] South Africa.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cswc.div.ed.ac.uk/2018/03/billy-graham-1918-2018-prophet-of-world-christianity/|title=Billy Graham (1918\u20132018): Prophet of World Christianity?|last=Stanley|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Stanley (historian)|date=March 2, 2018|website=Centre for the Study of World Christianity|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 13, 2020}}</ref> In [[Moscow]], in 1992, one-quarter of the 155,000 people in Graham's audience went forward at his call.<ref name=\"time1993\">Nancy Gibbs & Richard N.

{"title_page": "Martin P. Nilsson", "text_new": "[[File:{{#Property:P18}}|thumb|200px]]\n'''Martin Persson Nilsson''' ([[Stoby]], [[Kristianstad County]], 12 July 1874 \u2013 [[Lund]], 7 April 1967) was a Swedish philologist, [[mythographer]], and a scholar of the Greek, Hellenistic and Roman religious systems. In his studies he combined literary evidence with archaeological evidence, linking historic and prehistoric evidence for the evolution of the Greek mythological cycles.\n==Biography==\nBeginning in 1900 as a tutor at the [[University of Lund]], he was appointed Secretary to the Swedish Archaeological Commission working in [[Rhodes]], in 1905. In 1909 he was appointed Professor of Ancient Greek, Classical Archaeology and Ancient History at Lund. Later, Nilsson was Secretary of the Royal Society of Letters in Lund and an Associate of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities]], in Stockholm. In 1924 he was made a corresponding member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]].\n\n==Works==\nNilsson's best-known work in German is ''{{lang|de|Geschichte der griechischen Religion}}'' ({{trans|History of Greek Religion}}) in the ''{{lang|de|Handbuch der Altertumswissenschaft}}'' ({{trans|Handbook of Classical Antiquities}}), which went through several editions. Nilsson had previously published it in Swedish under the title ''{{lang|sv|Den grekiska religionens historia}}'' (1922).

[http://prism.oregonstate.edu/explorer/] The climate locally and in the surrounding area is classified by the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system as hot-summer [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] (''Dfa''). The local [[hardiness zone]] is 6b.\n\n==History==\n\n=== 1685 to 1906===\nThe original inhabitants of Wyomissing were [[Lenape]] (Delaware) Native Americans, who lived along the banks of Wyomissing Creek. The name ''Wyomissing'' is from the [[Delaware language]], meaning \"the land of flats\".<ref>Bright, William (2004). ''Native American Place Names of the United States''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pg. 576</ref> Much of Berks County was transferred from the Native Americans to [[William Penn]] in 1685. Title to the land that much of Wyomissing is built upon was in two parcels, an eastern tract and a western tract, which were divided by a northwesterly line in the vicinity of Lake Avenue. One of the earliest industries in the area was the Evans Grist Mill. This building still stands at the corner of Old Mill Road and Old Wyomissing Road.\n \nIn 1896, present-day Wyomissing began to take form when Thomas P. Merritt (a Reading lumber dealer) acquired {{convert|600|acre}}. Albert Thalheimer, David H. Keiser, Marthias Mengel, and [[Levi Walter Mengel]] joined Thomas R. Merrit in organizing the Reading Suburban Real Estate Company. Shortly afterwards Wyomissing Industries, manufacturer of textile machinery, was established by the firm of Thun & Janssen along the [[Reading Railroad]] just west of Van Reed Road (today named Park Road). Ferdinand Thun, Henry K Janssen, and Gustav Oberlaender became known as \"The Big Three of Wyomissing Industries.<ref name=Reading>[https://www.readingeagle.com/resources/article/ferdinand-thun-and-henry-k-janssen-were-destined-for-shared-success Ferdinand Thun and Henry K Janssen were destined for shared success] 16 January 2018 article in Reading Eagle</ref> Wyomissing Industries comprised Narrow Fabric Co., Textile Machine Works and Berkshire Knitting Mills.<ref name=Reading/> This spurred development, and soon there were many developers working to build Wyomissing.\n \nIn 1904 and 1905, Thun and Janssen called town meetings to discuss setting up a borough government. Eventually petitions were filed with the courts for the establishment of a borough, signed by 61 resident property owners and 39 non-resident property owners. \n \nOn July 2, 1906, the court issued the final decree of the incorporation of the Borough of Wyomissing.\n\n===1907 to present===\nBetween 1906 and the 1940s, several additional tracts of land were annexed to the borough from Spring and Cumru townships. However, 1949-1950 saw the largest annexation, With the addition of the area north of the railroad tracts known as Berkshire Heights. This drastically changed the borough map.\n \nFrom that point forward, the borough changed from farmland to a large residential and commercial community. The last farmland worked in the borough was part of the Hartman Farm at the intersection of Woodland and Papermill roads. This land was sold into commercial development in the early 1990s. This includes the area now called \"Woodmill Commons\", where DSW Shoes, Old Navy and other businesses now are located.\n\nIn 2002, Wyomissing merged with its smaller neighbor, Wyomissing Hills.\n\n==Economy==\nWyomissing is a thriving commercial office and retail center, in large part due to its proximity to [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]]. The [[Berkshire Mall (Pennsylvania)|Berkshire Mall]] is located in Wyomissing along with several other large shopping centers with their retail giants and restaurants. As crime soared in Reading throughout the 1990s, companies and corporations relocated from the city to newer, Class A office space in the borough. In addition to a suburban layout, the greater Wyomissing area is at the crossroads of U.S. Routes [[U.S. Route 422|422]] and [[U.S. Route 222|222]], providing immediate highway access to the rest of the greater [[Philadelphia]] and Berks County region. Several large corporations are headquartered in Wyomissing, including [[Penn National Gaming]], the second largest [[gambling|gaming]] company in the U.S., [[Boscov's]] Inc., one of the last family-owned department store chains in the U.S., and [[Carpenter Technology Corporation]]. [[UGI Corporation|UGI]] and [[VF Corporation]] have major operations in the borough. [[Sovereign Bank]] was previously headquartered here. Wyomissing has outpaced the rest of the Southeastern Pennsylvania region in job growth, registering an average job growth of 13.3% per year from 2000 to 2006. Financial giants [[Merrill Lynch]], [[Goldman Sachs]], and [[Citibank]] are developing data backup centers using the region's close proximity to major fiber optic lines running down the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 985\n|1920= 2062\n|1930= 3111\n|1940= 3320\n|1950= 4187\n|1960= 5044\n|1970= 7136\n|1980= 6551\n|1990= 7332\n|2000= 8587\n|2010= 10461\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=10499\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=June 11, 2013 }}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 8,587 people, 3,359 households, and 2,096 families residing in the borough.

The local [[hardiness zone]] is 6b.\n\n==History==\n\n=== 1685 to 1906===\nThe original inhabitants of Wyomissing were [[Lenape]] (Delaware) Native Americans, who lived along the banks of Wyomissing Creek. The name ''Wyomissing'' is from the [[Delaware language]], meaning \"the land of flats\".<ref>Bright, William (2004). ''Native American Place Names of the United States''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pg. 576</ref> Much of Berks County was transferred from the Native Americans to [[William Penn]] in 1685. Title to the land that much of Wyomissing is built upon was in two parcels, an eastern tract and a western tract, which were divided by a northwesterly line in the vicinity of Lake Avenue. One of the earliest industries in the area was the Evans Grist Mill. This building still stands at the corner of Old Mill Road and Old Wyomissing Road.\n \nIn 1896, present-day Wyomissing began to take form when Thomas P. Merritt (a Reading lumber dealer) acquired {{convert|600|acre}}. Albert Thalheimer, David H. Keiser, Marthias Mengel, and [[Levi Walter Mengel]] joined Thomas R. Merrit in organizing the Reading Suburban Real Estate Company. Shortly afterwards Wyomissing Industries, manufacturer of textile machinery, was established by the firm of Thun & Janssen along the [[Reading Railroad]] just west of Van Reed Road (today named Park Road). Ferdinand Thun, Henry K Janssen, and Gustav Oberlaender became known as \"The Big Three of Wyomissing Industries.<ref name=Reading>[https://www.readingeagle.com/resources/article/ferdinand-thun-and-henry-k-janssen-were-destined-for-shared-success Ferdinand Thun and Henry K Janssen were destined for shared success] 16 January 2018 article in Reading Eagle</ref> Wyomissing Industries comprised Narrow Fabric Co., Textile Machine Works and Berkshire Knitting Mills.<ref name=Reading/> This spurred development, and soon there were many developers working to build Wyomissing.\n \nIn 1904 and 1905, Thun and Janssen called town meetings to discuss setting up a borough government. Eventually petitions were filed with the courts for the establishment of a borough, signed by 61 resident property owners and 39 non-resident property owners. \n \nOn July 2, 1906, the court issued the final decree of the incorporation of the Borough of Wyomissing.\n\n===1907 to present===\nBetween 1906 and the 1940s, several additional tracts of land were annexed to the borough from Spring and Cumru townships. However, 1949-1950 saw the largest annexation, With the addition of the area north of the railroad tracts known as Berkshire Heights. This drastically changed the borough map.\n \nFrom that point forward, the borough changed from farmland to a large residential and commercial community. The last farmland worked in the borough was part of the Hartman Farm at the intersection of Woodland and Papermill roads. This land was sold into commercial development in the early 1990s. This includes the area now called \"Woodmill Commons\", where DSW Shoes, Old Navy and other businesses now are located.\n\nIn 2002, Wyomissing merged with its smaller neighbor, Wyomissing Hills.\n\n==Economy==\nWyomissing is a thriving commercial office and retail center, in large part due to its proximity to [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]]. The [[Berkshire Mall (Pennsylvania)|Berkshire Mall]] is located in Wyomissing along with several other large shopping centers with their retail giants and restaurants. As crime soared in Reading throughout the 1990s, companies and corporations relocated from the city to newer, Class A office space in the borough. In addition to a suburban layout, the greater Wyomissing area is at the crossroads of U.S. Routes [[U.S. Route 422|422]] and [[U.S. Route 222|222]], providing immediate highway access to the rest of the greater [[Philadelphia]] and Berks County region. Several large corporations are headquartered in Wyomissing, including [[Penn National Gaming]], the second largest [[gambling|gaming]] company in the U.S., [[Boscov's]] Inc., one of the last family-owned department store chains in the U.S., and [[Carpenter Technology Corporation]]. [[UGI Corporation|UGI]] and [[VF Corporation]] have major operations in the borough. [[Sovereign Bank]] was previously headquartered here. Wyomissing has outpaced the rest of the Southeastern Pennsylvania region in job growth, registering an average job growth of 13.3% per year from 2000 to 2006. Financial giants [[Merrill Lynch]], [[Goldman Sachs]], and [[Citibank]] are developing data backup centers using the region's close proximity to major fiber optic lines running down the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 985\n|1920= 2062\n|1930= 3111\n|1940= 3320\n|1950= 4187\n|1960= 5044\n|1970= 7136\n|1980= 6551\n|1990= 7332\n|2000= 8587\n|2010= 10461\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=10499\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=June 11, 2013 }}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 8,587 people, 3,359 households, and 2,096 families residing in the borough.

It borders [[Slovenia]] to the northwest, [[Hungary]] to the northeast, [[Serbia]] to the east, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Montenegro]] to the southeast, sharing a [[maritime border]] with [[Italy]]. Its capital, [[Zagreb]], forms one of the country's [[administrative divisions of Croatia|primary subdivisions]], along with [[twenty counties]]. Croatia has an area of {{convert|56594|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}} and a population of 4.28&nbsp;million, most of whom are [[Roman Catholics]].\n\nCroatia has been inhabited since the [[Paleolithic Age]]. The [[Croats]] arrived in the area in the 6th century and organised the territory into [[Duchy of Croatia|two duchies]] by the 9th century. Croatia was first internationally recognized as an independent state on 7 June 879 during the reign of duke [[Branimir of Croatia|Branimir]]. [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]] became the first king by 925, elevating Croatia to the status of a [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|kingdom]], which retained its sovereignty for nearly two centuries. During the succession crisis after the Trpimirovi\u0107 dynasty ended, Croatia [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|entered]] a [[personal union]] with [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] in 1102. In 1527, faced with [[Hundred Years' Croatian\u2013Ottoman War|Ottoman conquest]], the Croatian Parliament elected [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I of Austria]] to the Croatian throne. In October 1918, in the final days of [[World War I]], the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], independent from Austria-Hungary, was proclaimed in Zagreb, and in December 1918 it was [[Creation of Yugoslavia|merged into]] the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (renamed the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]<ref name=\"Stuart Foster and Keith Crawford, \u2018Introduction: The Critical Importance of History Textbook Research\u2019, in: What Shall We Tell the Children? : International Perspectives on School History Textbooks, eds.

In response,  a [[National Liberation Movement in Croatia|resistance movement]] developed. This led to the creation of the [[Federal State of Croatia]], which after the war became a founding member and constituent of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. On 25 June 1991, Croatia [[Independence of Croatia|declared independence]], which came wholly into effect on 8 October of the same year. The [[Croatian War of Independence]] was fought successfully for four years following the declaration.\n\nA [[sovereign state]], Croatia is a [[republic]] governed under a [[parliamentary system]]. It is a member of the [[European Union]] (EU), the [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[Council of Europe]], [[NATO]], the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), and a founding member of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]]. As an active participant in the [[UN peacekeeping forces]], Croatia has contributed troops to the [[NATO-led mission in Afghanistan]] and took a non-permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council]] for the 2008\u20132009 term. Since 2000, the [[Croatian government]] has constantly invested in infrastructure, especially [[Transport in Croatia|transport routes and facilities]] along the [[Pan-European corridors]].\n\nCroatia is classified by the World Bank as a [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income]] country and ranked 46th on the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2019.pdf |title=Human Development Report 2019 |publisher=UNDP|accessdate=1 October 2019}}</ref> The [[Croatia's economy|economy]] is dominated by [[service sector|service]], [[industrial sector]]s and agriculture.

It is made up of two divisions: Broadcast News and ITN Productions. ITN is based in [[London]], with bureaux and offices in [[Beijing]], [[Brussels]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Johannesburg]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Paris]], [[Sydney]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington DC]].\n\nITN produces the daily news programmes for ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 in the UK, and in recent years has diversified to produce a wide range of content including documentaries, sports, advertising and digital material for a range of international clients.\n\nBetween 1955 and 1999, ITN was more commonly known as the general brand name of ITV's news programmes. Since 8 March 1999, ITV has used ''[[ITV News]]'' as the brand name for its news programmes, though ITN continues as the network's news provider.\n\n==History==\nITN was founded in May 1955 by a consortium of the initial four [[Independent Television Authority|Independent Television]] (later ITV) broadcasting companies, with former [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Aidan Crawley]] as editor-in-chief. One of those companies, the London weekday contract-holder [[Associated-Rediffusion]] offered the new company studio space in its headquarters in [[Aldwych]], London. The first bulletin was broadcast at 10pm on 22 September 1955 on ITV's launch night. The bulletin was presented by former champion athlete [[Christopher Chataway]]. From the start, ITN broke new ground by introducing in-vision and named 'newscasters' (rather than the BBC's nameless and sound-only 'newsreaders'), and reporter packages. The unique, probing reporting style of [[Robin Day]] caused shock among politicians, finding themselves questioned continually for information \u2013 this had never been the case with the [[BBC]]. There was also some early tensions with the ITV companies. [[Associated British Corporation|ABC Television]], the ITV contractor for the north and Midlands on weekends, immediately called for shorter ITN bulletins. While the [[Independent Television Authority|ITA]] ruled on a minimum of a 20-minute bulletin, disagreements with the ITV companies over ITN's budget triggered the resignation of its news editor [[Aidan Crawley]] after just one year in 1956. He was replaced by [[Geoffrey Cox (journalist)|Geoffrey Cox]].<ref name=\"cultures\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vbLlAAAAQBAJ|title=Itv Cultures: Independent Television Over Fifty Years: Independent Television Over Fifty Years|first1=Johnson|last1=Catherine|first2=Turnock|last2=Rob|date=1 September 2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (UK)|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the early years, ITN continued to develop its service to the ITV network with an agenda to firstly, fulfil its public service broadcasting requirements and secondly satisfy the ITV companies by attracting viewers. Under this method, ITN continued to differentiate itself from the BBC by conducting probing interviews, introducing more human interest stories and bringing ordinary people on to screen by using so-called 'vox pops' (interviews, usually held in the street, with members of the general public), all of which were seen as a radical departure at the time in British broadcasting.<ref name=\"cultures\"/> As the ITN reporter and later ITN political editor [[Julian Haviland]], put it: \"My view was that at ITN we must be at least as responsible and accurate as the BBC, without being so damned boring\".<ref>{{cite book|title=And Finally... The History of ITN|first=Richard|last=Lindley|publisher=[[Methuen Publishing|Politico's Publishing]]|location=London|year=2005|isbn=9781842750674}}</ref> As ITV expanded, each ITV company that made up the network's federal structure had to purchase a stake in ITN and to continue to finance the company.\n\nIn 1967, ITN was given the go-ahead by the ITA to provide a full 30-minute daily news programme at 10pm on ITV. There was further tension with the ITV executives as they were sceptical of the idea that viewers would want a full 30 minutes of news every Monday to Friday and they were also losing valuable peak time slots which could be used for the sale of commercial advertising. ''[[ITV News at Ten|News at Ten]]'' began broadcasting on 3 July 1967 with a newscaster team consisting of [[Alastair Burnet]], [[Andrew Gardner (newsreader)|Andrew Gardner]], [[George Ffitch]] and [[Reginald Bosanquet]]. It was initially given a 13-week trial run, however, the programme proved to be extremely popular with viewers and continued for a further 32 years. ''News at Ten'' was to become one of the most prestigious news programmes of its time in British history with a reputation for high-quality journalism and innovation.<ref name=\"cultures\"/> ITN's ''News at Ten'' also prompted the BBC to gradually expand it's 20:50 news bulletin from ten minutes to fifteen, twenty and then twenty-five minutes. ''[[BBC Nine O'Clock News|The Nine O'Clock News]]'' began broadcasting in 1970 as ''News at Ten's'' rival. ITN also established other programmes in the ITV schedule. ''First Report'', a lunchtime bulletin began in 1972 and by 1976, ''News at 5.45'' commenced. This was a period when ITN enjoyed its greatest plaudits, following [[Lord Annan]]'s 1977 report on the future of broadcasting, which declared: \"We subscribe to the generally held view that ITN has the edge over BBC news.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Hayward|first=Anthony|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/20/sir-alastair-burnet|title=Sir Alastair Burnet obituary|date=2012-07-20|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-20|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nITN obtained the contract to produce ''[[Channel 4 News]]'' when the channel started broadcasting in 1982. The programme was launched by [[Peter Sissons]], [[Trevor McDonald]] and [[Sarah Hogg]]. The hour-long programme has been broadcast at 7pm since it started and has a reputation for high-quality journalism and thorough analysis. Further expansion came with the launch of [[Night Network|overnight television on ITV]] in 1988, with ITN providing hourly news bulletins, as well as the half-hour [[ITV News at 5:30|''ITN Morning News'']] to conclude the overnight schedules.\n\nUntil the 1990s, the individual ITV companies had an obligation to provide a national news programme, which required them to take a share in the ITN operation. Following the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]], ITN had to apply and bid for a licence to provide such services on these ITV network, and would have to fight competition in order to preserve its services, as had become the case with other ITV franchisees. The Broadcasting Act also allowed the Independent Television Commission to introduce ownership rules for news providers. The move was to transform the company from a 'cost centre' to a 'profit-making business'. The move saw 400 staff made redundant, and the closure of a number of international bureaux to claw back a \u00a310 million deficit in order to provide a competitive product to obtain the ITV news contract. Within three years the company turned to profit in 1993 with suggestions at the time that the company should be listed on the stock exchange.<ref name=\"cultures\"/>\n\nThe company launched ''[[5 News]]'' in 1997 following the foundation of [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]].\n\nThe 1990s saw major changes to the television landscape in Britain. The growth of multichannel television saw ITV's share of audience fall. Against this backdrop ITV itself became increasingly commercially aggressive. This was to be a major turning point in ITN's history which saw a reduction in the ITV news contract. By this period the main ITV companies [[Granada PLC|Granada]] and [[Carlton Communications|Carlton]] had also viewed unfavourably the scheduling of ''News at Ten'' which became a subject of dispute between ITN and the ITV companies. ITN favoured keeping the bulletin, however, the ITV companies claimed audiences were lost at 10pm as the news interrupted films and drama programming. ''News at Ten'' eventually ended in March 1999 with ITN's flagship bulletin moved to 6.30pm with a shorter late night bulletin at 11pm. Consolidation of the ITV network under a unified ITV brand also saw the removal of the on-screen ITN brand which was replaced with ''[[ITV News]]''.<ref name=\"cultures\"/> From this point, the ITN brand was gradually phased out and it is now only referenced to in the end production caption.\n\nIn 1997, ITN started producing the [[Royal Christmas Message]] every other year.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Plunkett|first=John|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/19/queen-christmas-message-sky-news|title=Queen's Christmas message to be produced by Sky for first time|date=2011-01-19|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-20|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nThe early years of the 21st century was to prove to be a challenging period. The axing of ''News at Ten'' caused public outcry and ITN's viewership figures fell by 13.9%<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=onN_BAAAQBAJ|title=No News is Bad News: Radio, Television and the Public|first=Michael|last=Bromley|date=11 September 2014|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}</ref> Political pressure and pressure from the media resulted in ITV bringing back a shorter 20 minute bulletin at 10pm three nights a week. The programme eventually lost share to the [[BBC News at Ten]] (which launched in 2000 to capitalise on ITV's move) and ITV eventually axed the programme again in 2004 and moved the bulletin to 10.30pm before bringing it back to 10pm again in 2008. The biggest challenge came in 2001 when [[British Sky Broadcasting]] bid to supply network news to ITV as part of a consortium. ITN eventually succeeded and was awarded a contract extension to 2008. In January 2005 Sky News took over supplying bulletins to [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]; ITN had produced ''[[5 News]]'' since its launch in 1997 and the contract was returned in February 2012, following a change of ownership at Channel 5.\n\nIn August 2000, ITN launched its own 24-hour news channel in the UK, broadcast on satellite, cable and digital terrestrial. It was 50% owned by ITN and 50% owned by [[Virgin Media|NTL]]. [[Carlton Communications|Carlton]] and [[Granada PLC|Granada]] gradually bought out the two stakes and renamed the channel the [[ITV News Channel]]. It closed down on 23 December 2005. Poor ratings in comparison to [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News 24]] and Sky News, and ITV's desire to re-use the channel's allocation on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], were cited as the reasons.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Conlan|first=Tara|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/dec/14/tvnews.itv|title=ITV News Channel axed|date=2005-12-14|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-20|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2004 following its acquisition of the [[London News Network]], a company previously owned by the now merged [[Carlton Communications|Carlton]] and [[Granada PLC|Granada]], ITN began producing local news bulletins for the [[ITV London]] region. ITN produced [[More4 News]] between 2005 and 2009. In 2007 it began producing [[Setanta Sports News]]; however it closed in 2009.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/setanta-uk-goes-into-administration-1.842268|title=Setanta UK goes into administration|last=|first=|date=23 June 2009|website=The Irish Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1996 and 2002, it also owned a share of [[London News Radio]], which was based at ITN's Gray's Inn Road headquarters and operated the [[LBC]] and [[LBC News 1152|News Direct London]] radio stations. ITN used to operate a radio news service on behalf of [[Independent Radio News]] (IRN) but on 15 October 2008, IRN announced that [[Sky News Radio]] was to replace ITN as its main supplier from March 2009.\n\nWhile news production remains the cornerstone of ITN's business model, the company has diversified from its original remit. ITN Source (originally ITN Archive) is one of the world's largest sources of historical film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itnsource.com/en/|title=The world's leading provider of archive footage|publisher=}}</ref> ITN Productions creates multi-platform content for major global brands, covering genres such as factual, entertainment, news and corporate production.

Originally the ITN logo and brand featured prominently on all news bulletins on ITV, however, since March 1999, bulletins have been branded as ''[[ITV News]]''. Trademarks of ''ITV News'' include the use of the clock-face of the [[Elizabeth Tower]] of [[Westminster Palace]], the chimes of [[Big Ben]] punctuating the days headlines and the signature theme tune; ''The Awakening'' by [[Johnny Pearson]].\n\nThroughout the early years, ITN established programmes in the ITV schedule including ''First Report'' at lunchtime, ''News at 5.45'' in the evening and the flagship ''News at Ten''. Today, ''ITV News'' on weekdays broadcasts the ''[[ITV Lunchtime News]]'' at 1.30pm, the ''[[ITV Evening News]]'' at 6.30pm and ''[[ITV News at Ten]]'' with bulletins broadcast at various times on weekends. ITN has at times interrupted the ITV schedule to provide updates on major breaking stories of national and international importance including the [[September 11 attacks]], [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London bombings, 2005]] or events involving the [[British Royal Family]]. ITN has covered every general election since 1955 for ITV, providing comprehensive coverage of the counts throughout election night and has also broadcast special programmes covering the [[UK budget]] speech given by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].\n\nITN's history is inextricably linked to that of ITV as prior to the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] each of the ITV companies owned a share. In the 1990s, under new ownership, it was accused of abandoning its previous news style, which was broadsheet in style to mid-market tabloid with news stories that focused on personalities in the news rather than heavy news coverage leading to accusations of [[dumbing down]] its coverage.\n\nITN's most famous news programme, ''[[ITV News at Ten|News at Ten]]'' was also controversially replaced by an 11pm news bulletin in 1999, said to be in order to allow ITV to broadcast films without the interruption of a 10 o'clock news bulletin. ''News at Ten'' was subsequently re-instated in 2001 after heavy public criticism over the change. The restored programme was 10 minutes shorter than its predecessor and carried less in-depth news coverage. It was also broadcast at a later time at least one day a week, which meant it was often jokingly referred to as ''News at When?'' There was increasing speculation that the ''News at Ten'' would again be moved, after under-performing against the ''Ten O'Clock News'' on [[BBC One]] which broadcasts every day at 10:00pm. In October 2003, the [[Independent Television Commission]] gave ITV approval to move ''News at Ten''.\n\nThe ''[[ITV News at 10.30]]'' launched on ITV on 2 February 2004 (the day that ITV in England, Wales and Southern Scotland came under the ownership of a single [[ITV plc|company]]) and was presented by Sir [[Trevor McDonald]]. The programme was longer than its predecessor and carried an integrated regional bulletin, as well as more business stories, a nightly sports update and a preview of the following day's newspapers. [[Mark Austin (journalist)|Mark Austin]] took over main presenting duties on 16 January 2006.\n\nThe rebranded programme again saw new titles, this time featuring people walking over the face of Big Ben and has lately followed a more \"sensationalist\" approach to its main headlines. When ITV executive chairman [[Michael Grade]] joined ITV, he made it clear that he saw news as the key in defining any channel. On 14 January 2008, the ''News at Ten'' returned, presented by [[Julie Etchingham]] and McDonald returned to his duties again. [[Mark Austin (journalist)|Mark Austin]] joined Etchingham as co-presenter in 2009. As of October 2015, [[Tom Bradby]] has been the main presenter on the programme.\n\n''[[ITV News at 6.30]]'' has, since it was launched in 1999, been the network's most popular bulletin. Its presenters include [[Mary Nightingale]], [[Ranvir Singh]] and [[Charlene White]].\n\nIn March 2004, ITN took over production of [[ITV London]]'s regional news programmes, which relocated from [[The London Television Centre]] on the [[South Bank]] to ITN's [[Gray's Inn Road]] base.\n\n===Channel 4 News===\n{{Main|Channel 4 News}}\n\nITN is home to [[Channel 4 News]], having produced the programme since the channel's inception in 1982.\n\nThe Channel 4 News flagship programme is 55 minutes of in-depth news and current affairs broadcast at 7pm each weekday and at 6.30pm on Saturdays and Sundays. The weekday evening programme is anchored by [[Jon Snow (journalist)|Jon Snow]], whereas [[Krishnan Guru-Murthy]] presents the weekend bulletins.\n\nA five-minute-long news summary goes out Monday to Friday at midday. The bulletin replaced Channel 4's 30-minute ''News at Noon'' programme in late 2009, six years after its launch during the Iraq War of 2003.\n\nITN created ''[[More4 News]]'' when the digital channel [[More4]] was launched in October 2005. It ran at 8pm, immediately after Channel 4 News. It was originally presented by [[Sarah Smith (news reporter)|Sarah Smith]]; [[Kylie Morris]] took over presenting duties in June 2007 and Smith was posted to the US as Channel 4 News' Washington correspondent. In December 2009 Channel 4 cancelled ''More4 News''.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Deans|first=Jason|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/aug/05/channel-4-news-at-noon-more4-news-cuts|title=Channel 4 to axe News at Noon and More4 News|date=2009-08-05|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-20|last2=Sweney|first2=Mark|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n===5 News===\n{{Main|5 News}}From the launch of [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] in 1997, ITN provided the news bulletins for [[5 News]]. However, in January 2005, ITN lost the contract, which was awarded to [[Sky News]]. In 2011 ITN regained the contract in a three-year deal to provide news for Channel 5 from early 2012, but on a much reduced budget. The deal followed an agreement by Sky and [[Northern & Shell]], the then-owner of Channel 5, to terminate the 5 News contract early.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Foster|first=Patrick|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/nov/03/itn-channel-5-news|title=ITN to regain Channel 5 news deal|date=2011-11-03|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-20|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n===International===\nITN began its own ''[[ITN World News|World News]]'' bulletins in the late 1980s, which were shown around the world on local television channels, particularly on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] stations in the [[United States|US]], where presenter [[Daljit Dhaliwal]] (now with [[Al-Jazeera English]]) enjoyed cult status.\n\nThese were discontinued in 2001, in the face of competition from dedicated news channels such as [[BBC World]] (now known as [[BBC World News]]), although it still provides footage to [[CNN International]] and reports often appear on ''[[PBS NewsHour]]''. Its ''ITV Evening News'' bulletin was shown on the [[Newsworld International]] cable channel in the US.\n\n===Other ventures===\nITN launched its 24-hour news channel in 2000, which was jointly bought by the main ITV companies [[Carlton Television|Carlton]] and [[Granada Television|Granada]] in 2002 and rebranded as the [[ITV News Channel]]. It was closed down in 2005.\n\n[[Setanta Sports News]] was a 24-hour sports news television channel produced by ITN and jointly owned by [[Living TV Group|Virgin Media Television]] and [[Setanta Sports]], launched on 29 November 2007. The channel ceased broadcasting on 23 June 2009, when Setanta's UK operation were placed into administration following financial difficulties.\n\nITN Consulting was the management consultancy arm of ITN, combining the resources of ITN with the consulting team's experience to advise global media companies on issues spanning all areas of strategy and operations, including financial planning, marketing, scheduling and content, recruitment, and interim management. With partner, Venture Consulting, it had offices in London, Milan, Dubai, Singapore and Sydney. It operated as a network with its consultants working on engagements globally and focused \"on how strategy can be implemented to deliver to real change\". ITN Consulting stated that \"an understanding of how global, regional and local media markets conflict and come together enables them to identify the opportunities this creates\". They took an external, outsider perspective as well as having the viewpoint of senior \"insider\" media executives. ITN Consulting was extensively involved in the development of business plans for local TV in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|title=ITN Consulting: Local TV|url=http://www.itnconsulting.co.uk/local-tv.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926003620/http://www.itnconsulting.co.uk/local-tv.html|archive-date=26 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It also consulted a range of national broadcasters on improving performance.

In May 2008, the Education Clip Library, a unique, video licensing service for educational publishers and broadcasters around the world, was launched.

However the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] allowed the ITC to set ownership rules. It was decided to limit the ITV companies to a maximum joint 49% stake, with no single company allowed more than a 20% holding. The powers were abolished by the [[Communications Act 2003]].\n\nITV plc's shareholding forms part of the wider ITV News Group which incorporates the regional operations in England, Southern Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands. The Director of the ITV News Group is Michael Jermey, a former editor and executive at ITN.\n\nITV's ownership of 40% of ITN (at that time equally split between Carlton and Granada) made the 2001 bid from Sky for ITV bulletins unlikely to succeed, the network having a vested interest to see ITN continue. The ITN contract for ITV News expires at the end of 2012.{{Update after|2020|4|20}} On 2 April 2007 ITN signed a deal which superseded the existing contract, worth at least \u00a342m per year, and invested more than \u00a315m to upgrade ITN's newsroom as part of the deal.\n\n==Parodies==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}\nITN has been spoofed several times on ITV's ''[[The Benny Hill Show]]'', namely in one 1971 show with the logo reading \"NIT\" instead of \"ITN\" and with Hill as [[Reginald Bosanquet|Reginald \"Boozenquet]]\" and [[Andrew Gardner (newsreader)|Andrew Gardner]].\n\nITN was also spoofed in a sketch in 1978 with Benny Hill as Angela O'Rippon, a parody of [[Angela Rippon]], and as Ann Afford, a parody of [[Anna Ford]].

Since 8 March 1999, ITV has used ''[[ITV News]]'' as the brand name for its news programmes, though ITN continues as the network's news provider.\n\n==History==\nITN was founded in May 1955 by a consortium of the initial four [[Independent Television Authority|Independent Television]] (later ITV) broadcasting companies, with former [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Aidan Crawley]] as editor-in-chief. One of those companies, the London weekday contract-holder [[Associated-Rediffusion]] offered the new company studio space in its headquarters in [[Aldwych]], London. The first bulletin was broadcast at 10pm on 22 September 1955 on ITV's launch night. The bulletin was presented by former champion athlete [[Christopher Chataway]]. From the start, ITN broke new ground by introducing in-vision and named 'newscasters' (rather than the BBC's nameless and sound-only 'newsreaders'), and reporter packages. The unique, probing reporting style of [[Robin Day]] caused shock among politicians, finding themselves questioned continually for information \u2013 this had never been the case with the [[BBC]]. There was also some early tensions with the ITV companies. [[Associated British Corporation|ABC Television]], the ITV contractor for the north and Midlands on weekends, immediately called for shorter ITN bulletins. While the [[Independent Television Authority|ITA]] ruled on a minimum of a 20-minute bulletin, disagreements with the ITV companies over ITN's budget triggered the resignation of its news editor [[Aidan Crawley]] after just one year in 1956. He was replaced by [[Geoffrey Cox (journalist)|Geoffrey Cox]].<ref name=\"cultures\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vbLlAAAAQBAJ|title=Itv Cultures: Independent Television Over Fifty Years: Independent Television Over Fifty Years|first1=Johnson|last1=Catherine|first2=Turnock|last2=Rob|date=1 September 2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (UK)|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the early years, ITN continued to develop its service to the ITV network with an agenda to firstly, fulfil its public service broadcasting requirements and secondly satisfy the ITV companies by attracting viewers. Under this method, ITN continued to differentiate itself from the BBC by conducting probing interviews, introducing more human interest stories and bringing ordinary people on to screen by using so-called 'vox pops' (interviews, usually held in the street, with members of the general public), all of which were seen as a radical departure at the time in British broadcasting.<ref name=\"cultures\"/> As the ITN reporter and later ITN political editor [[Julian Haviland]], put it: \"My view was that at ITN we must be at least as responsible and accurate as the BBC, without being so damned boring\".<ref>{{cite book|title=And Finally... The History of ITN|first=Richard|last=Lindley|publisher=[[Methuen Publishing|Politico's Publishing]]|location=London|year=2005|isbn=9781842750674}}</ref> As ITV expanded, each ITV company that made up the network's federal structure had to purchase a stake in ITN and to continue to finance the company.\n\nIn 1967, ITN was given the go-ahead by the ITA to provide a full 30-minute daily news programme at 10pm on ITV. There was further tension with the ITV executives as they were sceptical of the idea that viewers would want a full 30 minutes of news every Monday to Friday and they were also losing valuable peak time slots which could be used for the sale of commercial advertising. ''[[ITV News at Ten|News at Ten]]'' began broadcasting on 3 July 1967 with a newscaster team consisting of [[Alastair Burnet]], [[Andrew Gardner (newsreader)|Andrew Gardner]], [[George Ffitch]] and [[Reginald Bosanquet]]. It was initially given a 13-week trial run, however, the programme proved to be extremely popular with viewers and continued for a further 32 years. ''News at Ten'' was to become one of the most prestigious news programmes of its time in British history with a reputation for high-quality journalism and innovation.<ref name=\"cultures\"/> ITN's ''News at Ten'' also prompted the BBC to gradually expand it's 20:50 news bulletin from ten minutes to fifteen, twenty and then twenty-five minutes. ''[[BBC Nine O'Clock News|The Nine O'Clock News]]'' began broadcasting in 1970 as ''News at Ten's'' rival. ITN also established other programmes in the ITV schedule. ''First Report'', a lunchtime bulletin began in 1972 and by 1976, ''News at 5.45'' commenced. This was a period when ITN enjoyed its greatest plaudits, following [[Lord Annan]]'s 1977 report on the future of broadcasting, which declared: \"We subscribe to the generally held view that ITN has the edge over BBC news.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Hayward|first=Anthony|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/20/sir-alastair-burnet|title=Sir Alastair Burnet obituary|date=2012-07-20|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-20|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nITN obtained the contract to produce ''[[Channel 4 News]]'' when the channel started broadcasting in 1982. The programme was launched by [[Peter Sissons]], [[Trevor McDonald]] and [[Sarah Hogg]]. The hour-long programme has been broadcast at 7pm since it started and has a reputation for high-quality journalism and thorough analysis. Further expansion came with the launch of [[Night Network|overnight television on ITV]] in 1988, with ITN providing hourly news bulletins, as well as the half-hour [[ITV News at 5:30|''ITN Morning News'']] to conclude the overnight schedules.\n\nUntil the 1990s, the individual ITV companies had an obligation to provide a national news programme, which required them to take a share in the ITN operation. Following the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]], ITN had to apply and bid for a licence to provide such services on these ITV network, and would have to fight competition in order to preserve its services, as had become the case with other ITV franchisees. The Broadcasting Act also allowed the Independent Television Commission to introduce ownership rules for news providers. The move was to transform the company from a 'cost centre' to a 'profit-making business'. The move saw 400 staff made redundant, and the closure of a number of international bureaux to claw back a \u00a310 million deficit in order to provide a competitive product to obtain the ITV news contract. Within three years the company turned to profit in 1993 with suggestions at the time that the company should be listed on the stock exchange.<ref name=\"cultures\"/>\n\nThe company launched ''[[5 News]]'' in 1997 following the foundation of [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]].\n\nThe 1990s saw major changes to the television landscape in Britain. The growth of multichannel television saw ITV's share of audience fall. Against this backdrop ITV itself became increasingly commercially aggressive. This was to be a major turning point in ITN's history which saw a reduction in the ITV news contract. By this period the main ITV companies [[Granada PLC|Granada]] and [[Carlton Communications|Carlton]] had also viewed unfavourably the scheduling of ''News at Ten'' which became a subject of dispute between ITN and the ITV companies. ITN favoured keeping the bulletin, however, the ITV companies claimed audiences were lost at 10pm as the news interrupted films and drama programming. ''News at Ten'' eventually ended in March 1999 with ITN's flagship bulletin moved to 6.30pm with a shorter late night bulletin at 11pm. Consolidation of the ITV network under a unified ITV brand also saw the removal of the on-screen ITN brand which was replaced with ''[[ITV News]]''.<ref name=\"cultures\"/> From this point, the ITN brand was gradually phased out and it is now only referenced to in the end production caption.\n\nIn 1997, ITN started producing the [[Royal Christmas Message]] every other year.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Plunkett|first=John|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/19/queen-christmas-message-sky-news|title=Queen's Christmas message to be produced by Sky for first time|date=2011-01-19|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-20|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nThe early years of the 21st century was to prove to be a challenging period. The axing of ''News at Ten'' caused public outcry and ITN's viewership figures fell by 13.9%<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=onN_BAAAQBAJ|title=No News is Bad News: Radio, Television and the Public|first=Michael|last=Bromley|date=11 September 2014|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}</ref> Political pressure and pressure from the media resulted in ITV bringing back a shorter 20 minute bulletin at 10pm three nights a week. The programme eventually lost share to the [[BBC News at Ten]] (which launched in 2000 to capitalise on ITV's move) and ITV eventually axed the programme again in 2004 and moved the bulletin to 10.30pm before bringing it back to 10pm again in 2008. The biggest challenge came in 2001 when [[British Sky Broadcasting]] bid to supply network news to ITV as part of a consortium. ITN eventually succeeded and was awarded a contract extension to 2008. In January 2005 Sky News took over supplying bulletins to [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]; ITN had produced ''[[5 News]]'' since its launch in 1997 and the contract was returned in February 2012, following a change of ownership at Channel 5.\n\nIn August 2000, ITN launched its own 24-hour news channel in the UK, broadcast on satellite, cable and digital terrestrial. It was 50% owned by ITN and 50% owned by [[Virgin Media|NTL]]. [[Carlton Communications|Carlton]] and [[Granada PLC|Granada]] gradually bought out the two stakes and renamed the channel the [[ITV News Channel]]. It closed down on 23 December 2005. Poor ratings in comparison to [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News 24]] and Sky News, and ITV's desire to re-use the channel's allocation on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], were cited as the reasons.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Conlan|first=Tara|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/dec/14/tvnews.itv|title=ITV News Channel axed|date=2005-12-14|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-20|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2004 following its acquisition of the [[London News Network]], a company previously owned by the now merged [[Carlton Communications|Carlton]] and [[Granada PLC|Granada]], ITN began producing local news bulletins for the [[ITV London]] region. ITN produced [[More4 News]] between 2005 and 2009. In 2007 it began producing [[Setanta Sports News]]; however it closed in 2009.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/setanta-uk-goes-into-administration-1.842268|title=Setanta UK goes into administration|last=|first=|date=23 June 2009|website=The Irish Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1996 and 2002, it also owned a share of [[London News Radio]], which was based at ITN's Gray's Inn Road headquarters and operated the [[LBC]] and [[LBC News 1152|News Direct London]] radio stations. ITN used to operate a radio news service on behalf of [[Independent Radio News]] (IRN) but on 15 October 2008, IRN announced that [[Sky News Radio]] was to replace ITN as its main supplier from March 2009.\n\nWhile news production remains the cornerstone of ITN's business model, the company has diversified from its original remit.

Originally the ITN logo and brand featured prominently on all news bulletins on ITV, however, since March 1999, bulletins have been branded as ''[[ITV News]]''. Trademarks of ''ITV News'' include the use of the clock-face of the [[Elizabeth Tower]] of [[Westminster Palace]], the chimes of [[Big Ben]] punctuating the days headlines and the signature theme tune; ''The Awakening'' by [[Johnny Pearson]].\n\nThroughout the early years, ITN established programmes in the ITV schedule including ''First Report'' at lunchtime, ''News at 5.45'' in the evening and the flagship ''News at Ten''. Today, ''ITV News'' on weekdays broadcasts the ''[[ITV Lunchtime News]]'' at 1.30pm, the ''[[ITV Evening News]]'' at 6.30pm and ''[[ITV News at Ten]]'' with bulletins broadcast at various times on weekends. ITN has at times interrupted the ITV schedule to provide updates on major breaking stories of national and international importance including the [[September 11 attacks]], [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London bombings, 2005]] or events involving the [[British Royal Family]]. ITN has covered every general election since 1955 for ITV, providing comprehensive coverage of the counts throughout election night and has also broadcast special programmes covering the [[UK budget]] speech given by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].\n\nITN's history is inextricably linked to that of ITV as prior to the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] each of the ITV companies owned a share. In the 1990s, under new ownership, it was accused of abandoning its previous news style, which was broadsheet in style to mid-market tabloid with news stories that focused on personalities in the news rather than heavy news coverage leading to accusations of [[dumbing down]] its coverage.\n\nITN's most famous news programme, ''[[ITV News at Ten|News at Ten]]'' was also controversially replaced by an 11pm news bulletin in 1999, said to be in order to allow ITV to broadcast films without the interruption of a 10 o'clock news bulletin. ''News at Ten'' was subsequently re-instated in 2001 after heavy public criticism over the change. The restored programme was 10 minutes shorter than its predecessor and carried less in-depth news coverage. It was also broadcast at a later time at least one day a week, which meant it was often jokingly referred to as ''News at When?'' There was increasing speculation that the ''News at Ten'' would again be moved, after under-performing against the ''Ten O'Clock News'' on [[BBC One]] which broadcasts every day at 10:00pm. In October 2003, the [[Independent Television Commission]] gave ITV approval to move ''News at Ten''.\n\nThe ''[[ITV News at 10.30]]'' launched on ITV on 2 February 2004 (the day that ITV in England, Wales and Southern Scotland came under the ownership of a single [[ITV plc|company]]) and was presented by Sir [[Trevor McDonald]]. The programme was longer than its predecessor and carried an integrated regional bulletin, as well as more business stories, a nightly sports update and a preview of the following day's newspapers. [[Mark Austin (journalist)|Mark Austin]] took over main presenting duties on 16 January 2006.\n\nThe rebranded programme again saw new titles, this time featuring people walking over the face of Big Ben and has lately followed a more \"sensationalist\" approach to its main headlines. When ITV executive chairman [[Michael Grade]] joined ITV, he made it clear that he saw news as the key in defining any channel. On 14 January 2008, the ''News at Ten'' returned, presented by [[Julie Etchingham]] and McDonald returned to his duties again. [[Mark Austin (journalist)|Mark Austin]] joined Etchingham as co-presenter in 2009. As of October 2015, [[Tom Bradby]] has been the main presenter on the programme.\n\n''[[ITV News at 6.30]]'' has, since it was launched in 1999, been the network's most popular bulletin. Its presenters include [[Mary Nightingale]], [[Ranvir Singh]] and [[Charlene White]].\n\nIn March 2004, ITN took over production of [[ITV London]]'s regional news programmes, which relocated from [[The London Television Centre]] on the [[South Bank]] to ITN's [[Gray's Inn Road]] base.\n\n===Channel 4===\n{{Main|Channel 4 News}}\n\n====Channel 4 News====\n\nITN is home to [[Channel 4 News]], having produced the programme since the channel's inception in 1982.\n\nThe Channel 4 News flagship programme is 55 minutes of in-depth news and current affairs broadcast at 7pm each weekday and at 6.30pm on Saturdays and Sundays. The weekday evening programme is anchored by [[Jon Snow (journalist)|Jon Snow]], whereas [[Krishnan Guru-Murthy]] presents the weekend bulletins.\n\nA five-minute-long news summary goes out Monday to Friday at midday. The bulletin replaced Channel 4's 30-minute ''News at Noon'' programme in late 2009, six years after its launch during the Iraq War of 2003.\n\nITN created ''[[More4 News]]'' when the digital channel [[More4]] was launched in October 2005. It ran at 8pm, immediately after Channel 4 News. It was originally presented by [[Sarah Smith (news reporter)|Sarah Smith]]; [[Kylie Morris]] took over presenting duties in June 2007 and Smith was posted to the US as Channel 4 News' Washington correspondent. In December 2009 Channel 4 cancelled ''More4 News''.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Deans|first=Jason|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/aug/05/channel-4-news-at-noon-more4-news-cuts|title=Channel 4 to axe News at Noon and More4 News|date=2009-08-05|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-20|last2=Sweney|first2=Mark|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n===Channel 5===\n{{Main|5 News}}\n\n====5 News====\nFrom the launch of [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] in 1997, ITN provided the news bulletins for [[5 News]].

In 2011 ITN regained the contract in a three-year deal to provide news for Channel 5 from early 2012, but on a much reduced budget. The deal followed an agreement by Sky and [[Northern & Shell]], the then-owner of Channel 5, to terminate the 5 News contract early.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Foster|first=Patrick|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/nov/03/itn-channel-5-news|title=ITN to regain Channel 5 news deal|date=2011-11-03|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-20|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n===International===\nITN began its own ''[[ITN World News|World News]]'' bulletins in the late 1980s, which were shown around the world on local television channels, particularly on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] stations in the [[United States|US]], where presenter [[Daljit Dhaliwal]] (now with [[Al-Jazeera English]]) enjoyed cult status.\n\nThese were discontinued in 2001, in the face of competition from dedicated news channels such as [[BBC World]] (now known as [[BBC World News]]), although it still provides footage to [[CNN International]] and reports often appear on ''[[PBS NewsHour]]''. Its ''ITV Evening News'' bulletin was shown on the [[Newsworld International]] cable channel in the US.\n\n===Other ventures===\nITN launched its 24-hour news channel in 2000, which was jointly bought by the main ITV companies [[Carlton Television|Carlton]] and [[Granada Television|Granada]] in 2002 and rebranded as the [[ITV News Channel]]. It was closed down in 2005.\n\n[[Setanta Sports News]] was a 24-hour sports news television channel produced by ITN and jointly owned by [[Living TV Group|Virgin Media Television]] and [[Setanta Sports]], launched on 29 November 2007. The channel ceased broadcasting on 23 June 2009, when Setanta's UK operation were placed into administration following financial difficulties.\n\nITN Consulting was the management consultancy arm of ITN, combining the resources of ITN with the consulting team's experience to advise global media companies on issues spanning all areas of strategy and operations, including financial planning, marketing, scheduling and content, recruitment, and interim management. With partner, Venture Consulting, it had offices in London, Milan, Dubai, Singapore and Sydney. It operated as a network with its consultants working on engagements globally and focused \"on how strategy can be implemented to deliver to real change\". ITN Consulting stated that \"an understanding of how global, regional and local media markets conflict and come together enables them to identify the opportunities this creates\". They took an external, outsider perspective as well as having the viewpoint of senior \"insider\" media executives. ITN Consulting was extensively involved in the development of business plans for local TV in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|title=ITN Consulting: Local TV|url=http://www.itnconsulting.co.uk/local-tv.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926003620/http://www.itnconsulting.co.uk/local-tv.html|archive-date=26 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It also consulted a range of national broadcasters on improving performance.

A daily showbiz breakfast show, ''The Breakfast Fix'', is broadcast on 4Music.\n\nFrom August 2013, ITN Productions was awarded the contract to produce the Premier League online and mobile highlights service for [[News UK]]. Content appears on ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' and ''[[The Times]]'' subscription websites and mobile apps.\n\nDigital content is supplied to sports news video agency SNTV.\n\nITN Productions also creates factual programming for ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 as well as international broadcasters, including [[Discovery Channel]], [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]], [[PBS NewsHour|PBS]] and [[National Geographic Channel]].\n\nITN has produced shows for Sky, with one of its later programmes being ''[[Harrow: A Very British School]]''.\n\nITN also supplied programming to the now-closed [[Teachers TV]] service.\n\n==Ownership==\n{{unreferenced section | date = August 2010}}\nFrom its inception in 1955, ITN was originally jointly owned by all the ITV operating companies, the shares split roughly in proportion to each company's advertising income. However the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] allowed the ITC to set ownership rules. It was decided to limit the ITV companies to a maximum joint 49% stake, with no single company allowed more than a 20% holding. The powers were abolished by the [[Communications Act 2003]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Owner\n!

The Director of the ITV News Group is Michael Jermey, a former editor and executive at ITN.\n\nITV's ownership of 40% of ITN (at that time equally split between Carlton and Granada) made the 2001 bid from Sky for ITV bulletins unlikely to succeed, the network having a vested interest to see ITN continue. The ITN contract for ITV News expires at the end of 2012.{{Update after|2020|4|20}} On 2 April 2007 ITN signed a deal which superseded the existing contract, worth at least \u00a342m per year, and invested more than \u00a315m to upgrade ITN's newsroom as part of the deal.\n\n==Parodies==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}\nITN has been spoofed several times on ITV's ''[[The Benny Hill Show]]'', namely in one 1971 show with the logo reading \"NIT\" instead of \"ITN\" and with Hill as [[Reginald Bosanquet|Reginald \"Boozenquet]]\" and [[Andrew Gardner (newsreader)|Andrew Gardner]].\n\nITN was also spoofed in a sketch in 1978 with Benny Hill as Angela O'Rippon, a parody of [[Angela Rippon]], and as Ann Afford, a parody of [[Anna Ford]]. It was also spoofed in a black and white 1971 show and a 1973 episode.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of ITV journalists and newsreaders]]\n* [[Independent Radio News]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{Official website}}\n\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{ITV}}\n{{ITV News}}\n{{Channel Four Television Corporation}}\n{{Channel 5 Broadcasting}}\n\n{{Daily Mail and General Trust}}\n{{Thomson Reuters}}\n{{Media in the United Kingdom|comporg}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Itn}}\n[[Category:ITN| ]]\n[[Category:Television news in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Television production companies of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Companies based in London]]\n[[Category:Media companies based in London]]\n[[Category:1955 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:International Emmy Awards Current Affairs & News winners]]\n[[Category:Daily Mail and General Trust]]\n[[Category:ITV]]\n[[Category:Thomson Reuters]]\n[[Category:Informa]]\n", "name_user": "Salsareans", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(Remove table of broadcast timesWP:NOTTVGUIDE)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITN"}

{"title_page": "Book of Discipline (Quaker)", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nA '''Book of Discipline''' may refer to one of the various books issued by a [[Yearly Meeting]] of the [[Religious Society of Friends]], setting out what it means to be a [[Quaker]] in that [[Yearly Meeting]].  The common name for this book varies from one [[Yearly Meeting]] to another and includes ''Book of Discipline'', ''Faith and Practice'', ''Christian Faith and Practice'', ''Quaker Faith and Practice'', ''Church Government'' and ''Handbook of Practice and Procedure''.  Each Book of Discipline is updated periodically by each [[Yearly Meeting]] according to the usual practice of decision making within the [[Religious Society of Friends]].\n\n==Text and usage==\nThe contents of each book of discipline is agreed on by seeking unity among members of the authoring yearly meeting. Instead of voting or seeking an earthly consensus, the Meeting attempts to gain a sense of God's will for the community. Each member of the meeting is expected to listen to that of God within themselves and, if led, to contribute it to the group for reflection and consideration. Each member listens to others' contributions carefully, in an attitude of seeking Truth rather than of attempting to prevail or to debate. This process can be tedious and lengthy.  Nevertheless, this is thought to be the best way of reflecting the breadth of Quaker theology and practice, and is consistent with an intention that they be based in evolving personal experience and '[[inner light]]' rather than fixed [[creed]]s. The writings are not intended to represent strict rules which followers must agree with or adhere to, but may be used as a source of guidance or discipline. Since the majority of the Society remains within a Christian theistic tradition, this is typically reflected in the publication.\n\nExtracts from the book are sometimes read aloud in Quaker meetings for worship, or may be reflected upon individually.\n\n==History==\nThe Quakers are today almost the only survivors from the many religious groups that sprang up in the religious and social ferment of the English Civil War (1642\u20131649). They survived and flourished largely through the practical wisdom of a young man whose spiritual experiences and insights launched the movement. His name was George Fox. At the age of nineteen he entered a troubled period in which he found no spiritual help. Leaving home, he wandered for four years, consulting priests and non-conformist ministers. Having reached the point of near despair, he had a vivid spiritual experience, as he wrote in his Journal: \"When my hopes in all men were gone...then O then I heard a voice which said \"There is one, even Christ Jesus that can speak to thy condition\". And when I heard it, my heart did leap for joy.\"\n\nFeeling the call to preach he met a group of former Baptists, and together they called themselves \"The Children of Light\". Over the years, moving from the English Midlands into Yorkshire, Fox was accepted by a group of Seekers. As time went on they began to refer to themselves as \"Friends in the Truth\", and it is this that gives us the official name of the \"Religious Society of Friends\". The term \"Quakers\", which sometimes appears in brackets after the official name, comes from an insult used by a magistrate in Derby when he was sentencing some Friends for being non-conformist (Fox had bidden him to \"tremble at the word of the Lord\").\n\nOn 13 June 1652 George Fox addressed a crowd of about a thousand people on a hilltop called Firbank Fell in Northern England close to the English Lake District. This event is often considered to be the founding event of the Quaker faith. The rock on which he stood is referred to as Fox's Pulpit. Two weeks later in Ulverston, he met Margaret Fell while preaching in the church there. Margaret and her husband Thomas (a Justice of the Peace and later Member of Parliament) by the greatest good fortune took George Fox into their home, Swarthmoor Hall, and protected him, while the Valiant Sixty of newly converted Quakers ranged far and wide across England, spreading the good news of a simpler form of Christian faith. Some time after Thomas Fell died, Margaret and George were married.\n\nWhile other religious groups of the period faded away with time, Fox devoted himself in 1666\u20131668 to setting up a structure of meetings which has remained virtually the same up until the present day: local 'particular' meetings, grouped regionally into \"monthly meetings\", \"quarterly meetings\" above them, and an annual \"General Assembly of the Brethren\" (usually referred to as a Yearly Meeting) as the leading authority. There has been a national annual meeting of some sort in Britain every year since 1668.\n<ref>Alastair Heron \"The British Quakers 1647\u20131997\" Curlew Publishers, 1997</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe earliest statement of Christian discipline was the ''[[Epistle (Quaker)|Epistle]] from the meeting of Elders at Balby'', in 1656.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qhpress.org/texts/balby.html |title=Balby Letter of 1656 |publisher=Qhpress.org |date=16 November 2001 |accessdate=19 September 2015}}</ref> This was a list of twenty advices as to how Friends should conduct themselves, formed following a meeting of prominent Seekers at Balby in Yorkshire, and is seen by many as the defining document founding Quakerism.\n\nThe ''Canons and institutions drawn up and agreed upon by the General Assembly or Meeting of the heads of the Quakers from all parts of the kingdom''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2447177?lookfor=&offset=&max=228 |title=Canons and institutions [microform&#93; / drawn up and agreed upon by the General Assembly or Meeting of... &#124; National Library of Australia |publisher=Catalogue.nla.gov.au |accessdate=19 September 2015}}</ref> was produced following a meeting of leading Quakers in London in 1669.  This had been drafted by [[George Fox]], the name ''Canons and Institutions'' had been given to the publication by his opponents.  It contained general advices and regulations, and was the basis of future books of discipline, although the name was formally disclaimed by Friends in 1675.<ref>[http://www.wilmingtonyearlymeeting.org/faith/introduction.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708135412/http://www.wilmingtonyearlymeeting.org/faith/introduction.htm |date=8 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe origins of the current book of discipline can be traced back to a manuscript in 1738 entitled ''Christian and brotherly advices given forth from time to time by the Yearly Meetings in London, alphabetically digested under proper heads''.  The first printed collection appeared in 1783 as ''Extracts from the minutes and advices of the Yearly Meeting of Friends held in London from its first institution'' (popularly known as the ''Book of Extracts'').  This was revised in 1801 and 1822 and 1833 (the last revision resulting in another change in title to ''Rules of Discipline'').  Up until this time, the publication was an alphabetical list of the main beliefs and practices of Quakers at the time.\n\nFrom 1861 the ''Rules of Discipline'' was divided into separate chapters on\n*''Christian Doctrine'' \u2013 concerning the Christian theology and beliefs of Friends;\n*''Christian Practice'' \u2013 concerning the lives and testimonies of Friends\n*''Church Government'' \u2013 concerning the organisation, structure and government of the Religious Society of Friends, instead of the alphabetical arrangement of topics.  This was revised in 1883, where it took the name ''Book of Christian discipline''.  Subsequently, the three chapters became three separate books, revised at various points over the next 50 years.\n\nIn 1921, a new publication ''Christian Life, Faith and Thought'' replaced the previous ''Christian Doctrine''.  This publication adopted a new approach of attempting \"to state truth, not by formulating it, but by expressing it through the vital personal and corporate experience of Friends\". Although much of this publication is in the form of prose drafted by a Revision Committee, this publication began the use of extracts which has subsequently been developed as an acceptable method of expressing the breadth of Quaker theology. In 1959 ''Christian Life, Faith and Thought'' and ''Christian Practice'' were revised, followed by a revision in 1967 of ''Church Government'', and the three were merged into one new volume entitled ''Christian faith and practice in the experience of the Society of Friends''.  The 1959 edition of ''Christian Faith and Practice'', whilst no longer used in Britain Yearly Meeting, is still a current book of discipline of Canadian Yearly Meeting.  ''Church Government'' and ''Christian faith and practice'' together made up the Book of Discipline.\n\nA new British revision was worked on from 1985, due to requests \"not from the centre but from local meetings and individual Friends, as well as committees\".<ref name=NotFromTheCentre>{{cite book|title= Quaker Faith and Practice|edition= 3rd|author=Britain Yearly Meeting|isbn=0-85245-306-X|page=14}}</ref> to reflect developments in society, language and belief. The new version was accepted by Britain Yearly Meeting in 1994, and appeared in print in 1995, in one volume.  This volume is almost entirely made up of an anthology of extracts from other sources, unlike earlier editions.  This edition saw the name change to its current form \u2013 ''Quaker Faith and Practice: The book of Christian discipline of the Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends in Britain''. The chapters on the structure and organisation of Britain Yearly Meeting have been revised several times since then to reflect organisational changes in Britain Yearly Meeting, and latterly to re-write the Chapter on 'Quaker marriage procedure' in connection with the Quaker approval of same-sex marriage. The rest of the book as currently exists has not been redrafted since 1994; however the process of doing so is currently beginning, as agreed by Britain Yearly Meeting in 2018.\n\nSome Quakers in Britain have suggested that future editions revert to having two volumes to the Book of Discipline: ''Church Government'' dealing with organisation, structure and government of the Yearly Meeting; and ''Faith and Practice'' dealing with the beliefs, testimonies and practices of Quakers in Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefriend.org/articledisplay.asp?articleid=2403 |title=The Quaker magazine |publisher=The Friend |accessdate=19 September 2015}}</ref> The Fifth edition as revised through 2013 is available online.\n\n===United States===\nVarious Yearly Meetings were founded in what is now the [[United States]] from the early days of Quakerism.  Each of these produced their own book of discipline, although each was based on the earlier disciplines of London Yearly Meeting.  These were revised at various points according to changes in beliefs and practices of Friends over time.\n\nConferences of Yearly Meetings in the later part of the nineteenth century, between the [[Joseph John Gurney|Guerneyite]] Yearly Meetings, who had accepted the [[Richmond Declaration|Richmond Declaration of Faith]], proposed formulating a ''Uniform Discipline'' for all the Guerneyite Yearly Meetings in the United States.  In 1897, [[New England Yearly Meeting]], [[Wilmington Yearly Meeting]], [[Indiana Yearly Meeting]], and [[Kansas Yearly Meeting]] jointly accepted ''The Constitution and Discipline for the American Yearly Meetings of Friends'' as their book of discipline, and this book was subsequently accepted as the book of discipline of [[California Yearly Meeting]], [[New York Yearly Meeting]], [[Western Yearly Meeting]], and [[Baltimore Yearly Meeting]] in 1901; and of [[Oregon Yearly Meeting]], [[North Carolina Yearly Meeting]], and [[Iowa Yearly Meeting]] in 1902. When [[Nebraska Yearly Meeting]] was founded in 1908, they too accepted ''The Constitution and Discipline for the American Yearly Meetings of Friends'' as their book of discipline.\n\nIn 1940, [[Evangelical Friends International#History|Five Years Meeting]] proposed that the 1897 ''Uniform Discipline'' be updated and revised.  The ensuing publication ''Faith and Practice'', was published in three volumes: (I) Faith and Life; (II) Organisation and Business Procedure; (III) Authorised Declaration of Faith.  However, controversies and disagreements between Yearly Meetings meant that not all Yearly Meetings accepted this book of discipline \u2013 some accepted only one or two volumes, and others made revisions or alterations to the text.  The publication was never formally accepted by Five Years Meeting, although some Yearly Meetings did formally accept a revised version as their own book of discipline.  Since then, each Yearly Meeting has revised their own books of discipline, and no longer use a ''Uniform Discipline''.\n\n====Philadelphia Yearly Meeting====\nPhiladelphia Yearly Meeting published their ''Rules of Discipline of the Yearly Meeting of Friends held in Philadelphia'' in 1806,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qhpress.org/texts/obod/ |title=The Old Discipline |publisher=Qhpress.org |accessdate=19 September 2015}}</ref> with paragraphs on each of the main practices and testimonies of Friends in that Yearly Meeting arranged in alphabetical order.  The title ''Faith and Practice'' was first applied to Philadelphia Yearly Meeting's book of discipline in 1955 and it was revised in 1972, 1979, and 1997, with minor revisions in 2002.\n\n==Current books of discipline==\n{{Expand list|date=April 2009}}\nThere are currently over 30 different versions in print, each by a different yearly meeting, some also available to be viewed on-line.  The names of the publications vary.  Most Yearly Meetings either have:\n*One volume called the ''Book of Discipline''\n*Two volumes, which together make up the ''Book of Discipline'':\n**One called either ''Church Government'' or ''Handbook of Practice and Procedure'' \u2013 which deals with how the Yearly Meeting is organised and governed;\n**The other book called either ''Faith and Practice'' or ''Faith, Life and Thought'' or similar title \u2013 which deals with the main beliefs, doctrines and testimonies of the Quakers in that Yearly Meeting.\n\n===Australia===\n[[Australia Yearly Meeting]] publishes two separate books in the tradition of Quaker books of discipline. The ''Handbook of Practice and Procedure'' gives a brief history of the Society and detailed instructions on how the Society in Australia is run.<ref name=\"aus_prac\">Australia Yearly Meeting (2005) [http://www.quakers.org.au/pubs_handbook4.shtml Handbook of Practice and Procedure] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410234104/http://www.quakers.org.au/pubs_handbook4.shtml |date=10 April 2007 }}, 4th Edition</ref> ''This We Can Say: Quaker life, faith and thought'', first published in 2003, was written over a period of ten years from 1993, to express personally the living faith of contemporary Australian Quakers.<ref name=\"aus_say\">[http://www.quakers.org.au/old_pubs_twcs.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808175838/http://www.quakers.org.au/old_pubs_twcs.html |date=8 August 2007 }}</ref> It also includes the Britain Yearly Meeting Advices and Queries.\n\n===Britain===\n[[File:Quaker Faith And Practice.gif|thumb|The third edition of ''Quaker Faith and Practice'']]\n[[Britain Yearly Meeting]]'s current book of discipline is called ''Quaker Faith and Practice: The book of Christian discipline of the Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in Britain''. The text of the first edition was originally approved by the Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends in Britain in 1994, and it has had four revisions since then, mainly because of changes in the structure of the Yearly Meeting. The fourth revision (giving rise to the 5th Edition, dated 2013) was in connection with the Quaker approval of same-sex marriage in the UK. It is often known simply as ''Quaker Faith and Practice'', or sometimes the (Christian) 'Book of Discipline' but this has become less common. The current version, therefore, (in June 2014) is the fifth edition. It is available in paperback, hardback and large print, and is also free to view online.<ref name=BYM_FandP>[http://www.quaker.org.uk/qfp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112132859/http://www.quaker.org.uk/qfp |date=12 January 2008 }}</ref> The book is only available from the Quaker Bookshop in Friends House, Euston, London, UK or from the online bookshop.<ref name=\"quakerbookshop\">{{cite web|author=Quakers in Britain |url=http://www.quaker.org.uk/bookshop |title=Quakers in Britain |publisher=Quaker.org.uk |accessdate=19 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first chapter, Advices and Queries, originated from queries asked by London Yearly Meeting (the predecessor to Britain Yearly Meeting) to the quarterly meetings about the state of their meetings, and advices originated from the original ''Christian and brotherly advices given forth from time to time by the Yearly Meetings in London, alphabetically digested under proper heads''. Until 1994, there were separate ''General Advices'' and ''Queries'', which tended to be related to each other \u2013 the advices giving advice on Christian living, and the queries being questions which asked Friends how they were living their lives, and could be used for personal reflection or discussion in groups. There was a requirement that all the advices and queries were read in each meeting over the course of a year.  Since 1994, the advices and queries have been mixed together, so that each paragraph has both advices and queries within it. There is also no longer a requirement that they are read in each meeting, although some meetings do continue this practice.  This chapter is published as a separate free booklet and is published in both [[English language|English]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]].<ref name=\"quakerbookshop\" />\n\n===Canada===\nThe books of discipline of Canadian Yearly Meeting are made up of three publications:\n* ''Canadian Yearly Meeting Organisation and Procedure'' (current edition published 2004) \u2013 which concerns the organisation, government and structure of Canadian Yearly Meeting, as well as chapters on membership, marriage procedures, etc.;\n* In 2010 Canadian Yearly Meeting published its own book of discipline which has replaced the 1967 edition of ''Christian Faith and Practice in the Experience of the Society of Friends of London Yearly Meeting'' (\"the blue book\"), although it remains a useful reference. The new book is titled ''Faith and Practice of Canadian Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends''.  \n* ''Advices and Queries'' \u2013 Canadian Yearly Meeting uses the same edition as Britain Yearly Meeting.\n\nIn 2000, Canadian Yearly Meeting appointed a Faith and Practice Development Committee to co-ordinate development of its own ''Faith and Practice'', published in 2010.<ref>[http://www.quaker.ca/Publications/discipline/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527115415/http://www.quaker.ca/Publications/discipline/index.html |date=27 May 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Denmark===\n''R\u00e5d og Sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l'' (Advices and Queries) is the Advices and Queries of Denmark Yearly Meeting, being a Danish translation based on the 1994 ''Advices and Queries'' of Britain Yearly Meeting.\n\n===Central and Southern Africa===\nCentral and Southern Africa Yearly Meeting's book of discipline is called ''The Handbook of Practice and Procedure'', including chapters on structure, organisation and government of the Society of Friends and Quaker experience and concerns.

English and American Friends organized a Quaker colony in Friedensthal (Peace Valley), which existed from 1792 until 1870 in what is now [[Bad Pyrmont]], a city in the district of Hamelin-Pyrmont, in [[Lower Saxony]] (Niedersachsen), Germany.  Land was donated for a meeting house in January 1791 and the Quaker Meeting House was built. In 1933, it was reconstructed and relocated from its original site to Bombergallee 9, Bad Pyrmont.  The German Annual Meeting (Deutsche Jahresversammlung) was organized in 1880.  The Germany Yearly Meeting (die Deutsche Jahresversammlung or DJV) resulted from the 1923 mergers of the German Annual Meeting with the Friends of Quakerism (Freunde des Qu\u00e4kertums) and, in 1925, the Federation of German Friends (Bund der deutschen Freunde) and serves as an umbrella organization for the small liberal Quaker presence in [[Germany]] and [[Austria]].

The common name for this book varies from one [[Yearly Meeting]] to another and includes ''Book of Discipline'', ''Faith and Practice'', ''Christian Faith and Practice'', ''Quaker Faith and Practice'', ''Church Government'' and ''Handbook of Practice and Procedure''.  Each Book of Discipline is updated periodically by each [[Yearly Meeting]] according to the usual practice of decision making within the [[Religious Society of Friends]].\n\n==Text and usage==\nThe contents of each book of discipline is agreed on by seeking unity among members of the authoring yearly meeting. Instead of voting or seeking an earthly consensus, the Meeting attempts to gain a sense of God's will for the community. Each member of the meeting is expected to listen to that of God within themselves and, if led, to contribute it to the group for reflection and consideration. Each member listens to others' contributions carefully, in an attitude of seeking Truth rather than of attempting to prevail or to debate. This process can be tedious and lengthy.  Nevertheless, this is thought to be the best way of reflecting the breadth of Quaker theology and practice, and is consistent with an intention that they be based in evolving personal experience and '[[inner light]]' rather than fixed [[creed]]s. The writings are not intended to represent strict rules which followers must agree with or adhere to, but may be used as a source of guidance or discipline. Since the majority of the Society remains within a Christian theistic tradition, this is typically reflected in the publication.\n\nExtracts from the book are sometimes read aloud in Quaker meetings for worship, or may be reflected upon individually.\n\n==History==\nThe Quakers are today almost the only survivors from the many religious groups that sprang up in the religious and social ferment of the English Civil War (1642\u20131649). They survived and flourished largely through the practical wisdom of a young man whose spiritual experiences and insights launched the movement. His name was George Fox. At the age of nineteen he entered a troubled period in which he found no spiritual help. Leaving home, he wandered for four years, consulting priests and non-conformist ministers. Having reached the point of near despair, he had a vivid spiritual experience, as he wrote in his Journal: \"When my hopes in all men were gone...then O then I heard a voice which said \"There is one, even Christ Jesus that can speak to thy condition\". And when I heard it, my heart did leap for joy.\"\n\nFeeling the call to preach he met a group of former Baptists, and together they called themselves \"The Children of Light\". Over the years, moving from the English Midlands into Yorkshire, Fox was accepted by a group of Seekers. As time went on they began to refer to themselves as \"Friends in the Truth\", and it is this that gives us the official name of the \"Religious Society of Friends\". The term \"Quakers\", which sometimes appears in brackets after the official name, comes from an insult used by a magistrate in Derby when he was sentencing some Friends for being non-conformist (Fox had bidden him to \"tremble at the word of the Lord\").\n\nOn 13 June 1652 George Fox addressed a crowd of about a thousand people on a hilltop called Firbank Fell in Northern England close to the English Lake District. This event is often considered to be the founding event of the Quaker faith. The rock on which he stood is referred to as Fox's Pulpit. Two weeks later in Ulverston, he met Margaret Fell while preaching in the church there. Margaret and her husband Thomas (a Justice of the Peace and later Member of Parliament) by the greatest good fortune took George Fox into their home, Swarthmoor Hall, and protected him, while the Valiant Sixty of newly converted Quakers ranged far and wide across England, spreading the good news of a simpler form of Christian faith. Some time after Thomas Fell died, Margaret and George were married.\n\nWhile other religious groups of the period faded away with time, Fox devoted himself in 1666\u20131668 to setting up a structure of meetings which has remained virtually the same up until the present day: local 'particular' meetings, grouped regionally into \"monthly meetings\", \"quarterly meetings\" above them, and an annual \"General Assembly of the Brethren\" (usually referred to as a Yearly Meeting) as the leading authority. There has been a national annual meeting of some sort in Britain every year since 1668.\n<ref>Alastair Heron \"The British Quakers 1647\u20131997\" Curlew Publishers, 1997</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe earliest statement of Christian discipline was the ''[[Epistle (Quaker)|Epistle]] from the meeting of Elders at Balby'', in 1656.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qhpress.org/texts/balby.html |title=Balby Letter of 1656 |publisher=Qhpress.org |date=16 November 2001 |accessdate=19 September 2015}}</ref> This was a list of twenty advices as to how Friends should conduct themselves, formed following a meeting of prominent Seekers at Balby in Yorkshire, and is seen by many as the defining document founding Quakerism.\n\nThe ''Canons and institutions drawn up and agreed upon by the General Assembly or Meeting of the heads of the Quakers from all parts of the kingdom''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2447177?lookfor=&offset=&max=228 |title=Canons and institutions [microform&#93; / drawn up and agreed upon by the General Assembly or Meeting of... &#124; National Library of Australia |publisher=Catalogue.nla.gov.au |accessdate=19 September 2015}}</ref> was produced following a meeting of leading Quakers in London in 1669.  This had been drafted by [[George Fox]], the name ''Canons and Institutions'' had been given to the publication by his opponents.  It contained general advices and regulations, and was the basis of future books of discipline, although the name was formally disclaimed by Friends in 1675.<ref>[http://www.wilmingtonyearlymeeting.org/faith/introduction.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708135412/http://www.wilmingtonyearlymeeting.org/faith/introduction.htm |date=8 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe origins of the current book of discipline can be traced back to a manuscript in 1738 entitled ''Christian and brotherly advices given forth from time to time by the Yearly Meetings in London, alphabetically digested under proper heads''.  The first printed collection appeared in 1783 as ''Extracts from the minutes and advices of the Yearly Meeting of Friends held in London from its first institution'' (popularly known as the ''Book of Extracts'').  This was revised in 1801 and 1822 and 1833 (the last revision resulting in another change in title to ''Rules of Discipline'').  Up until this time, the publication was an alphabetical list of the main beliefs and practices of Quakers at the time.\n\nFrom 1861 the ''Rules of Discipline'' was divided into separate chapters on\n*''Christian Doctrine'' \u2013 concerning the Christian theology and beliefs of Friends;\n*''Christian Practice'' \u2013 concerning the lives and testimonies of Friends\n*''Church Government'' \u2013 concerning the organisation, structure and government of the Religious Society of Friends, instead of the alphabetical arrangement of topics.  This was revised in 1883, where it took the name ''Book of Christian discipline''.  Subsequently, the three chapters became three separate books, revised at various points over the next 50 years.\n\nIn 1921, a new publication ''Christian Life, Faith and Thought'' replaced the previous ''Christian Doctrine''.  This publication adopted a new approach of attempting \"to state truth, not by formulating it, but by expressing it through the vital personal and corporate experience of Friends\". Although much of this publication is in the form of prose drafted by a Revision Committee, this publication began the use of extracts which has subsequently been developed as an acceptable method of expressing the breadth of Quaker theology. In 1959 ''Christian Life, Faith and Thought'' and ''Christian Practice'' were revised, followed by a revision in 1967 of ''Church Government'', and the three were merged into one new volume entitled ''Christian faith and practice in the experience of the Society of Friends''.  The 1959 edition of ''Christian Faith and Practice'', whilst no longer used in Britain Yearly Meeting, is still a current book of discipline of Canadian Yearly Meeting.  ''Church Government'' and ''Christian faith and practice'' together made up the Book of Discipline.\n\nA new British revision was worked on from 1985, due to requests \"not from the centre but from local meetings and individual Friends, as well as committees\".<ref name=NotFromTheCentre>{{cite book|title= Quaker Faith and Practice|edition= 3rd|author=Britain Yearly Meeting|isbn=0-85245-306-X|page=14}}</ref> to reflect developments in society, language and belief. The new version was accepted by Britain Yearly Meeting in 1994, and appeared in print in 1995, in one volume.  This volume is almost entirely made up of an anthology of extracts from other sources, unlike earlier editions.  This edition saw the name change to its current form \u2013 ''Quaker Faith and Practice: The book of Christian discipline of the Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends in Britain''. The chapters on the structure and organisation of Britain Yearly Meeting have been revised several times since then to reflect organisational changes in Britain Yearly Meeting, and latterly to re-write the Chapter on 'Quaker marriage procedure' in connection with the Quaker approval of same-sex marriage. The rest of the book as currently exists has not been redrafted since 1994; however the process of doing so is currently beginning, as agreed by Britain Yearly Meeting in 2018.\n\nSome Quakers in Britain have suggested that future editions revert to having two volumes to the Book of Discipline: ''Church Government'' dealing with organisation, structure and government of the Yearly Meeting; and ''Faith and Practice'' dealing with the beliefs, testimonies and practices of Quakers in Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefriend.org/articledisplay.asp?articleid=2403 |title=The Quaker magazine |publisher=The Friend |accessdate=19 September 2015}}</ref> The Fifth edition as revised through 2013 is available online.\n\n===United States===\nVarious Yearly Meetings were founded in what is now the [[United States]] from the early days of Quakerism.  Each of these produced their own book of discipline, although each was based on the earlier disciplines of London Yearly Meeting.  These were revised at various points according to changes in beliefs and practices of Friends over time.\n\nConferences of Yearly Meetings in the later part of the nineteenth century, between the [[Joseph John Gurney|Guerneyite]] Yearly Meetings, who had accepted the [[Richmond Declaration|Richmond Declaration of Faith]], proposed formulating a ''Uniform Discipline'' for all the Guerneyite Yearly Meetings in the United States.  In 1897, [[New England Yearly Meeting]], [[Wilmington Yearly Meeting]], [[Indiana Yearly Meeting]], and [[Kansas Yearly Meeting]] jointly accepted ''The Constitution and Discipline for the American Yearly Meetings of Friends'' as their book of discipline, and this book was subsequently accepted as the book of discipline of [[California Yearly Meeting]], [[New York Yearly Meeting]], [[Western Yearly Meeting]], and [[Baltimore Yearly Meeting]] in 1901; and of [[Oregon Yearly Meeting]], [[North Carolina Yearly Meeting]], and [[Iowa Yearly Meeting]] in 1902. When [[Nebraska Yearly Meeting]] was founded in 1908, they too accepted ''The Constitution and Discipline for the American Yearly Meetings of Friends'' as their book of discipline.\n\nIn 1940, [[Evangelical Friends International#History|Five Years Meeting]] proposed that the 1897 ''Uniform Discipline'' be updated and revised.  The ensuing publication ''Faith and Practice'', was published in three volumes: (I) Faith and Life; (II) Organisation and Business Procedure; (III) Authorised Declaration of Faith.  However, controversies and disagreements between Yearly Meetings meant that not all Yearly Meetings accepted this book of discipline \u2013 some accepted only one or two volumes, and others made revisions or alterations to the text.  The publication was never formally accepted by Five Years Meeting, although some Yearly Meetings did formally accept a revised version as their own book of discipline.  Since then, each Yearly Meeting has revised their own books of discipline, and no longer use a ''Uniform Discipline''.\n\n====Philadelphia Yearly Meeting====\nPhiladelphia Yearly Meeting published their ''Rules of Discipline of the Yearly Meeting of Friends held in Philadelphia'' in 1806,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qhpress.org/texts/obod/ |title=The Old Discipline |publisher=Qhpress.org |accessdate=19 September 2015}}</ref> with paragraphs on each of the main practices and testimonies of Friends in that Yearly Meeting arranged in alphabetical order.  The title ''Faith and Practice'' was first applied to Philadelphia Yearly Meeting's book of discipline in 1955 and it was revised in 1972, 1979, and 1997, with minor revisions in 2002.\n\n==Current books of discipline==\n{{Expand list|date=April 2009}}\nThere are currently over 30 different versions in print, each by a different yearly meeting, some also available to be viewed on-line.  The names of the publications vary.  Most Yearly Meetings either have:\n*One volume called the ''Book of Discipline''\n*Two volumes, which together make up the ''Book of Discipline'':\n**One called either ''Church Government'' or ''Handbook of Practice and Procedure'' \u2013 which deals with how the Yearly Meeting is organised and governed;\n**The other book called either ''Faith and Practice'' or ''Faith, Life and Thought'' or similar title \u2013 which deals with the main beliefs, doctrines and testimonies of the Quakers in that Yearly Meeting.\n\n===Australia===\n[[Australia Yearly Meeting]] publishes two separate books in the tradition of Quaker books of discipline. The ''Handbook of Practice and Procedure'' gives a brief history of the Society and detailed instructions on how the Society in Australia is run.<ref name=\"aus_prac\">Australia Yearly Meeting (2005) [http://www.quakers.org.au/pubs_handbook4.shtml Handbook of Practice and Procedure] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410234104/http://www.quakers.org.au/pubs_handbook4.shtml |date=10 April 2007 }}, 4th Edition</ref> ''This We Can Say: Quaker life, faith and thought'', first published in 2003, was written over a period of ten years from 1993, to express personally the living faith of contemporary Australian Quakers.<ref name=\"aus_say\">[http://www.quakers.org.au/old_pubs_twcs.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808175838/http://www.quakers.org.au/old_pubs_twcs.html |date=8 August 2007 }}</ref> It also includes the Britain Yearly Meeting Advices and Queries.\n\n===Britain===\n[[File:Quaker Faith And Practice.gif|thumb|The third edition of ''Quaker Faith and Practice'']]\n[[Britain Yearly Meeting]]'s current book of discipline is called ''Quaker Faith and Practice: The book of Christian discipline of the Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in Britain''. The text of the first edition was originally approved by the Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends in Britain in 1994, and it has had four revisions since then, mainly because of changes in the structure of the Yearly Meeting. The fourth revision (giving rise to the 5th Edition, dated 2013) was in connection with the Quaker approval of same-sex marriage in the UK. It is often known simply as ''Quaker Faith and Practice'', or sometimes the (Christian) 'Book of Discipline' but this has become less common. The current version, therefore, (in June 2014) is the fifth edition. It is available in paperback, hardback and large print, and is also free to view online.<ref name=BYM_FandP>[http://www.quaker.org.uk/qfp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112132859/http://www.quaker.org.uk/qfp |date=12 January 2008 }}</ref> The book is only available from the Quaker Bookshop in Friends House, Euston, London, UK or from the online bookshop.<ref name=\"quakerbookshop\">{{cite web|author=Quakers in Britain |url=http://www.quaker.org.uk/bookshop |title=Quakers in Britain |publisher=Quaker.org.uk |accessdate=19 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first chapter, Advices and Queries, originated from queries asked by London Yearly Meeting (the predecessor to Britain Yearly Meeting) to the quarterly meetings about the state of their meetings, and advices originated from the original ''Christian and brotherly advices given forth from time to time by the Yearly Meetings in London, alphabetically digested under proper heads''. Until 1994, there were separate ''General Advices'' and ''Queries'', which tended to be related to each other \u2013 the advices giving advice on Christian living, and the queries being questions which asked Friends how they were living their lives, and could be used for personal reflection or discussion in groups. There was a requirement that all the advices and queries were read in each meeting over the course of a year.  Since 1994, the advices and queries have been mixed together, so that each paragraph has both advices and queries within it. There is also no longer a requirement that they are read in each meeting, although some meetings do continue this practice.  This chapter is published as a separate free booklet and is published in both [[English language|English]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]].<ref name=\"quakerbookshop\" />\n\n===Canada===\nThe books of discipline of Canadian Yearly Meeting are made up of three publications:\n* ''Canadian Yearly Meeting Organisation and Procedure'' (current edition published 2004) \u2013 which concerns the organisation, government and structure of Canadian Yearly Meeting, as well as chapters on membership, marriage procedures, etc.;\n* In 2010 Canadian Yearly Meeting published its own book of discipline which has replaced the 1967 edition of ''Christian Faith and Practice in the Experience of the Society of Friends of London Yearly Meeting'' (\"the blue book\"), although it remains a useful reference. The new book is titled ''Faith and Practice of Canadian Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends''.  \n* ''Advices and Queries'' \u2013 Canadian Yearly Meeting uses the same edition as Britain Yearly Meeting.\n\nIn 2000, Canadian Yearly Meeting appointed a Faith and Practice Development Committee to co-ordinate development of its own ''Faith and Practice'', published in 2010.<ref>[http://www.quaker.ca/Publications/discipline/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527115415/http://www.quaker.ca/Publications/discipline/index.html |date=27 May 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Denmark===\n''R\u00e5d og Sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l'' (Advices and Queries) is the Advices and Queries of Denmark Yearly Meeting, being a Danish translation based on the 1994 ''Advices and Queries'' of Britain Yearly Meeting.\n\n===Central and Southern Africa===\nCentral and Southern Africa Yearly Meeting's book of discipline is called ''The Handbook of Practice and Procedure'', including chapters on structure, organisation and government of the Society of Friends and Quaker experience and concerns.

English and American Friends organized a Quaker colony in Friedensthal (Peace Valley), which existed from 1792 until 1870 in what is now [[Bad Pyrmont]], a city in the district of Hamelin-Pyrmont, in [[Lower Saxony]] (Niedersachsen), Germany.  Land was donated for a meeting house in January 1791 and the Quaker Meeting House was built. In 1933, it was reconstructed and relocated from its original site to Bombergallee 9, Bad Pyrmont.  The German Annual Meeting (Deutsche Jahresversammlung) was organized in 1880.  The Germany Yearly Meeting (die Deutsche Jahresversammlung or DJV) resulted from the 1923 mergers of the German Annual Meeting with the Friends of Quakerism (Freunde des Qu\u00e4kertums) and, in 1925, the Federation of German Friends (Bund der deutschen Freunde) and serves as an umbrella organization for the small liberal Quaker presence in [[Germany]] and [[Austria]].  This body uses a translation of [[Britain Yearly Meeting]]'s current book of discipline  ''Quaker Faith and Practice: The book of Christian discipline of the Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in Britain'' entitled ''Qu\u00e4ker\u2014Glaube und Wirken (das Handbuch der Qu\u00e4ker zur christlichen Lebensf\u00fchrung, \u00fcbersetzt aus dem Englischen)'', 2010, 468 pp., price:  \u20ac25.00 plus postage, {{ISBN|978-3-929696-44-8}}\n\n===New Zealand===\nIn 2003, the Quakers of New Zealand published ''Quaker faith and practice in Aotearoa New Zealand'', their first manual of Faith and Practice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quaker.org.nz/quaker-faith-and-practice-in-aotearoanew-zealand |title=Quaker Faith and Practice in Aotearoa/New Zealand |publisher=quaker.org.nz |date=4 January 1998 |accessdate=19 September 2015}}</ref> The book is 22&nbsp;cm and following three pages of prefatory materials, there are 177 pages of text.

It is an anthology of quotes on Swiss Quakers' lives, beliefs and thoughts, published tri-lingually in English, French and German.
