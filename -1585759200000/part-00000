He was succeeded by [[Gerald Ford]], whom he had appointed [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] after Spiro Agnew was forced to resign. Nixon took office after the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 presidential election]], in which he defeated incumbent Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]]. Although Nixon had built his reputation as a  very active [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican campaigner]], he downplayed partisanship in his 1972 landslide reelection.\n\nNixon's primary focus while in office was on foreign affairs. He focused on [[d\u00e9tente]] with the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Soviet Union]], easing [[Cold War]] tensions with both countries. As part of this policy, Nixon signed the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] and [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT]] I, two landmark arms control treaties with the [[Soviet Union]]. Nixon promulgated the [[Nixon Doctrine]], which called for indirect assistance by the United States rather than direct U.S. commitments as seen in the ongoing [[Vietnam War]]. After extensive negotiations with [[North Vietnam]], Nixon withdrew the last U.S. soldiers from [[South Vietnam]] in 1973, ending the military draft that same year. To prevent the possibility of further U.S. intervention in Vietnam, Congress passed the [[War Powers Resolution]] over Nixon's veto.\n\nIn domestic affairs, Nixon advocated a policy of \"[[New Federalism]],\" in which federal powers and responsibilities would be shifted to the [[U.S. state|states]]. However, he faced a Democratic Congress that did not share his goals and, in some cases, enacted legislation over his veto. Nixon's proposed reform of federal welfare programs did not pass Congress, but Congress did adopt one aspect of his proposal in the form of [[Supplemental Security Income]], which provides aid to low-income individuals who are aged or disabled. The Nixon administration adopted a \"low profile\" on school desegregation, but the administration enforced court desegregation orders and implemented the first [[affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]] plan in the United States. Nixon also presided over the creation of [[Environmental Protection Agency]] and the passage of major environmental laws like the [[Clean Water Act]]. Economically, the Nixon years saw the start of a period of \"[[stagflation]]\" that would continue into the 1970s.\n\nNixon was far ahead in the polls in the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential election]], but during the campaign, Nixon operatives conducted several illegal operations designed to undermine the opposition. They were exposed when the break-in of the [[Democratic National Committee]] Headquarters, ended in the arrest of five burglars and gave rise to a congressional investigation. Nixon denied any involvement in the break in, but, after a tape emerged revealing that Nixon had known about the White House connection to the Watergate burglaries shortly after they occurred, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] initiated impeachment proceedings. Facing removal by Congress, Nixon resigned from office. Though some scholars believe that Nixon \"has been excessively maligned for his faults and inadequately recognised for his virtues\",{{sfn|Aitken|p=577}} Nixon is generally ranked as a below average president in [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|surveys of historians and political scientists]].<ref name=\"brottinghaus\"/><ref name=\"Siena\"/><ref name=\"cspanrankings\"/>\n\n== Election of 1968 ==\n{{further|Republican Party presidential primaries, 1968|United States presidential election, 1968}}\n\n===Republican nomination===\n[[Richard Nixon]] had served as vice president from 1953 to 1961, and had been defeated in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential election]] by [[John F.

The United States and Soviet Union had been the clear leaders of their respective blocs of allies during the 1950s, but the world became increasingly multipolar during the 1960s. U.S. allies in Western Europe and East Asia had recovered economically, and while they remained allied with United States, they set their own foreign policies. The fracture in the so-called \"[[Second World]]\" of Communist states was more serious, as the [[Sino-Soviet split|split]] between the Soviet Union and [[China]] escalated into a [[Sino-Soviet border conflict|border conflict]] in 1969. The United States and the Soviet Union continued to compete for worldwide influence, but tensions had eased considerably since the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. In this shifting international context, Nixon and Kissinger sought to realign U.S. foreign policy and establish peaceful coexistence with both the Soviet Union and China.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=760\u2013761, 765}} Nixon's goal of closer relations with China and the Soviet Union was closely linked to ending the Vietnam War,{{sfn|Gaddis|pp=294, 299}}{{sfn|Guan|pp=61, 69, 77\u201379}}{{sfn|Zhai|p=136}} since he hoped that rapprochement with the two leading Communist powers would pressure North Vietnam into accepting a favorable settlement.<ref>{{cite book| last = Nixon| first = Richard| date = 1985| title = No More Vietnams| pages = [https://archive.org/details/nomorevietnams00nixo/page/105 105\u2013106]| publisher = Arbor House Publishing Company| location = Westminster, Maryland| isbn = 978-0-87795-668-6| url = https://archive.org/details/nomorevietnams00nixo/page/105}}</ref>\n\n==== China ====\n{{Further|1972 Nixon visit to China}}\n[[File:Nixon shakes hands with Chou En-lai.jpg|thumb|President Nixon shakes hands with Chinese Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] upon arriving in Beijing]]\n\nSince the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]], the United States had refused to formally recognize the People's Republic of China (PRC) as the legitimate government of China, though the PRC controlled [[Mainland China]]. The U.S. had instead supported the [[Republic of China]] (ROC), which controlled Taiwan.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=775\u2013776}} By the time Nixon took office, many leading foreign policy figures in the United States had come to believe the U.S. should end its policy of isolating the PRC.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=118\u2013119}} The vast Chinese markets presented an economic opportunity for the increasingly-weak U.S. economy, and the Sino-Soviet split offered an opportunity to play the two Communist powers against each other. Chinese leaders, meanwhile, were receptive to closer relations with the U.S. for several reasons, including hostility to the Soviet Union, a desire for increased trade, and hopes of winning international recognition.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=775\u2013776}}\n\nBoth sides faced domestic pressures against closer relations. A conservative faction of Republicans led by [[Barry Goldwater]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] strongly opposed a rapprochement with China, while [[Lin Biao]] led a similar faction in the PRC. For the first two years of his presidency, Nixon and China each made subtle moves designed to lower tensions, including the removal of travel restrictions. The expansion of the Vietnam War into Laos and Cambodia hindered, but did not derail, the move towards normalization of relations.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=776\u2013778}} Due to a misunderstanding at the [[1971 World Table Tennis Championships]], the Chinese [[table tennis]] team invited the [[ping-pong diplomacy|U.S. table tennis team to tour China]], creating an opening for further engagement between the U.S. and China.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=120\u2013121}} In the aftermath of the visit, Nixon lifted the trade embargo on China.

Through d\u00e9tente, he hoped to \"minimize confrontation in marginal areas and provide, at least, alternative possibilities in the major ones.\" [[West Germany]] had also pursued closer relations with the Soviet Union in a policy known as \"[[Ostpolitik]],\" and Nixon hoped to re-establish American dominance in [[NATO]] by taking the lead in negotiations with the Soviet Union. Nixon also believed that expanding trade with the Soviet Union would help the U.S. economy and could allow both countries to devote fewer resources to defense spending. For their part, the Soviets were motivated by a struggling economy and their ongoing split with China.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=770\u2013773}}\n\nUpon taking office, Nixon took several steps to signal to the Soviets his desire for negotiation. In his first press conference, he noted that the United States would accept nuclear parity, rather than superiority, with the Soviet Union. Kissinger conducted extensive backchannel talks with Soviet Ambassador [[Anatoly Dobrynin]] over arms control negotiations and potential Soviet assistance in negotiations with North Vietnam. Seeking a bargaining chip in negotiations, Nixon funded development of [[Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle|MIRV]]s, which were not easily countered by existing [[anti-ballistic missile]] (ABM) systems. Arms control negotiations would thus center over ABM systems, MIRVs, and the various components of each respective country's nuclear arsenal. After over a year of negotiations, both sides agreed to the outlines of two treaties; one treaty would focus on ABM systems, while the other would focus on limiting nuclear arsenals.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=773\u2013775}}\n\n[[File:\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0421\u0428\u0410 \u0420\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0440\u0434 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0441\u043e\u043d \u0432 1972 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443 \u0432 \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0435.jpg|thumb|right|Richard Nixon in [[Kiev]] in 1972]]\n\nIn May 1972, Nixon met with [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and other leading Soviet officials at the 1972 [[Moscow Summit (1972)|Moscow Summit]]. The two sides reached the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|Strategic Arms Limitation Agreement]] (SALT I), which set upper limits on the number of offensive missiles and [[ballistic missile submarine]]s that each county could maintain. A separate agreement, the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]], stipulated that each country could only field two anti-ballistic missile systems. The United States also agreed to the creation of the [[Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe]].{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=794\u2013795}} An October 1972 trade agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union vastly increased trade between the two countries, though Congress did not approve of Nixon's proposal to extend [[most favoured nation]] status to the Soviet Union.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=113\u2013115}}\n\nNixon would embark on a second trip to the Soviet Union in 1974, meeting with Brezhnev in [[Yalta]].

These activities concerned the Soviets and Cubans, who feared Nixon might attack Cuba in violation of the understanding between Kennedy and Khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis. In August 1970, the Soviets asked Nixon to reaffirm the agreement. Despite his hard line against Castro, Nixon agreed. The process\u2014which began in secret, but quickly leaked\u2014had not been completed when the U.S. deduced that the Soviets were expanding their base at the Cuban port of [[Cienfuegos]] in October 1970.

Johnson's [[Great Society]] programs and the Vietnam War effort had resulted in large budget deficits. There was little unemployment,<ref name=RNdomestic>{{cite web| url=https://millercenter.org/president/nixon/domestic-affairs| title=Richard Nixon: Domestic Affairs| publisher= Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia| location=Charlottesville, Virginia| accessdate=February 24, 2016}}</ref> but interest rates were at their highest in a century.{{sfn|Ambrose 1989|pp=225\u2013226}} Nixon's major economic goal was to reduce inflation; the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war.{{sfn|Ambrose 1989|pp=225\u2013226}} As the war continued, the administration adopted a policy of restricting the growth of the money supply to address the inflation problem. In February 1970, as a part of the effort to keep federal spending down, Nixon delayed pay raises to federal employees by six months. When the nation's [[postal worker]]s went on strike, he used the army to keep the postal system going. In the end, the government met the postal workers' wage demands, undoing some of the desired budget-balancing.<ref>{{cite book| title=The American Kings: Growth in Presidential Power from George Washington to Barack Obama| last=Shinkoskey| first=Robert Kimball| publisher=Wipf and Stock| location=Eugene, Oregon| date=2014| isbn=978-1-62564-194-6| page=290}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1969, Nixon somewhat reluctantly signed the [[Tax Reform Act of 1969]] despite its inflationary provisions; the act established the [[alternative minimum tax]], which applied to wealthy individuals who used deductions to limit their tax liabilities.{{Sfn|Small|1999|p=205}} In 1970, Congress granted the president the power to impose [[wage]] and [[price controls]], though the Democratic congressional leadership, knowing Nixon had opposed such controls through his career, did not expect Nixon to actually use the authority.{{r|Bowles-Small}} With inflation unresolved by August 1971, and an election year looming, Nixon convened a summit of his economic advisers at [[Camp David]]. He then announced temporary wage and price controls, allowed the dollar to float against other currencies, and ended the convertibility of the dollar into gold.{{sfn|Aitken|pp=399\u2013400}} Nixon's monetary policies effectively took the United States off the [[gold standard]] and brought an end to the [[Bretton Woods system]], a post-war international [[fixed exchange-rate system]]. Nixon believed that this system negatively affected the U.S. [[balance of trade]]; the U.S. had experienced its first negative balance of trade of the 20th century in 1971.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=208\u2013210}} Bowles points out, \"by identifying himself with a policy whose purpose was inflation's defeat, Nixon made it difficult for Democratic opponents&nbsp;... to criticize him. His opponents could offer no alternative policy that was either plausible or believable since the one they favored was one they had designed but which the president had appropriated for himself.\"{{r|Bowles-Small}} Nixon's policies dampened inflation in 1972, but their aftereffects contributed to inflation during his second term and into the Ford administration.{{sfn|Aitken|pp=399\u2013400}}\n\nAs Nixon began his second term, the economy was plagued by a [[1973\u20131974 stock market crash|stock market crash]], a surge in inflation, and the [[1973 oil crisis]].{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=203\u2013204}} With the legislation authorizing price controls set to expire on April 30, the [[Senate Democratic Caucus]] recommended a 90-day freeze on all profits, interest rates, and prices.<ref name=Hetzel>{{cite book| last = Hetzel| first = Robert L.| year = 2008| title = The Monetary Policy of the Federal Reserve| publisher = Cambridge University Press| location = New York| isbn = 978-0-521-88132-6| page = 92}}</ref> Nixon re-imposed price controls in June 1973, echoing his 1971 plan, as food prices rose; this time, he focused on agricultural exports and limited the freeze to 60 days.<ref name=Hetzel/> The price controls became unpopular with the public and business people, who saw powerful labor unions as preferable to the price board bureaucracy.<ref name=Hetzel/> Business owners, however, now saw the controls as permanent rather than temporary, and voluntary compliance among small businesses decreased.<ref name=Hetzel/> The controls and the accompanying [[Economic shortage|food shortage]]s\u2014as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss\u2014only fueled more inflation.<ref name=Hetzel/> Despite their failure to rein in inflation, controls were slowly ended, and on April 30, 1974, their statutory authorization lapsed.<ref name=Hetzel/> Between Nixon's accession to office and his resignation in August 1974, unemployment rates had risen from 3.5% to 5.6%, and the rate of inflation had grown from 4.7% to 8.7%.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=203\u2013204}} Observers coined a new term for the undesirable combination of unemployment and inflation: \"[[stagflation]],\" a phenomenon that would worsen after Nixon left office.{{sfn|Patterson|p=737, 785\u2013786}}\n\n=== Social programs ===\n{{Further|Liberalism in the United States}}\n====Welfare====\n[[File:Richard M. Nixon posing with his cabinet in the cabinet room in the white house. - NARA - 194353.jpg|thumbnail|right|350px|President Nixon's cabinet in 1971.]]\n\nOne of Nixon's major promises in the 1968 campaign was to address what he described as the \"[[Social programs in the United States|welfare]] mess.\" The number of individuals enrolled in the [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]] program had risen from 3 million in 1960 to 8.4 million in 1970, contributing to a drop in [[Poverty in the United States|poverty]]. However, many Americans, particularly conservatives, believed that [[Welfare trap|welfare programs discouraged individuals from finding employment]]; conservatives also derided \"[[welfare queen]]s\" who they alleged collected excessive amounts of welfare benefits.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=185\u2013186}} On taking office, Nixon established the Council of Urban Affairs, under the leadership of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, to develop a welfare reform proposal. Moynihan's proposed plan centered on replacing welfare programs with a [[negative income tax]], which would provide a [[guaranteed minimum income]] to all Americans. Nixon became closely involved in the proposal and, despite opposition from Arthur Burns and other conservatives, adopted Moynihan's plan as the central legislative proposal of his first year in office. In an August 1969 televised address, Nixon proposed the Family Assistance Plan (FAP), which would establish a national income floor of $1600 per year for a family of four.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=187\u2013188}}\n\nPublic response to the FAP was highly favorable, but it faced strong opposition in Congress, partly due to the lack of congressional involvement in the drafting of the proposal. Many conservatives opposed the establishment of the national income floor, while many liberals believed that the floor was too low.

He was elected to a second term on  November 7, 1972 in one of the [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|largest landslide election victories in American history]]. He won over 60% of the popular vote, receiving 47,169,911 votes to McGovern's 29,170,383, and won an even larger Electoral College victory, garnering 520 electoral votes to 17 for McGovern.{{sfn|Parmet|p=629}} Despite Nixon's strong victory, Democrats retained control of both houses of Congress.{{Sfn|Small|1999|p=267}} In the aftermath of the elections, many conservative Southern Democratic congressmen seriously discussed the possibility of [[Party switching in the United States|switching parties]] to give Republicans control of the House, but these talks were derailed by the Watergate scandal.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=243\u2013244}}\n\n== Watergate and resignation ==\n\n=== Committee for the Re-Election of the President ===\n{{Main|White House Plumbers|Committee for the Re-Election of the President}}\n\nAfter the Supreme Court denied the Nixon administration's request to prevent the publication of the Pentagon Papers, Nixon and Ehrlichman established the White House Special Investigations Unit, also known as the \"Plumbers.\" The Plumbers were charged with preventing future [[news leak]]s and retaliating against [[Daniel Ellsberg]], who had been behind the leaking of the Pentagon Papers. Among those who joined the Plumbers were [[G. Gordon Liddy]], E. Howard Hunt, and Charles Colson. Shortly after the establishment of the Plumbers, the organization broke into the office of Ellsberg's psychiatrist.{{sfn|Patterson|pp=756\u2013757}} Rather than relying on the [[Republican National Committee]], Nixon's re-election campaign was primarily waged through the [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President]] (CRP), whose top leadership was composed of former White House personnel.{{sfn|Leuchtenberg|pp=514-515}} Liddy and Hunt became involved with the CRP, conducting espionage on Democrats.{{sfn|Patterson|pp=772\u2013773}}\n\nDuring the 1972 Democratic primaries, Nixon and his allies believed that Senator McGovern would be the weakest plausible Democratic nominee in the general election, and the CRP worked to bolster McGovern's strength. Nixon was not informed about the details of each CRP undertaking, but he approved of the overall operation.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=253\u2013254}} The CRP especially targeted Muskie, secretly employing Muskie's driver as a spy. The CRP also established fake organizations that nominally supported Muskie, and used those organizations to attack other Democratic candidates; Senator Henry Jackson was accused of having been arrested for homosexual activities, while Humphrey was alleged to have been involved in a drunk driving incident.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=254\u2013255}} In June 1972, Hunt and Liddy led a break-in of the [[Democratic National Committee]]'s headquarters at the [[Watergate complex]]. The break-in was foiled by the police, and the Nixon administration denied any involvement in the incident.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=255\u2013256}} The break-in perpetrators were indicted on in September 1972, but federal judge [[John Sirica]] ordered a gag order on the case until after the election. Though Watergate remained in the news during the 1972 campaign, it had relatively little effect on the election.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=260\u2013261}} The motivation for the Watergate break-in remains a matter of dispute.{{sfn|Patterson|p=772}}\n\n=== Watergate ===\n{{Watergate|Events}}\n{{main|Watergate scandal|Impeachment process against Richard Nixon}}\n\nNixon may not have known about the Watergate break-in beforehand,{{sfn|Patterson|pp=772\u2013773}} but he became involved in a cover-up. Nixon and Haldeman pressured the FBI to end its investigation of Watergate, and [[White House Counsel]] [[John Dean]] promised the Watergate burglars money and executive clemency if they did not implicate the White House in the break-in.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=276\u2013278}} The Watergate burglars were convicted in January 1973 without implicating the White House, but members of Congress organized an investigation into Nixon's role in Watergate.

Under Ervin's leadership, the Senate established the [[United States Senate Watergate Committee|Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities]] to investigate and conduct hearings on Watergate.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=279\u2013280}} The \"Watergate hearings\" were televised and widely watched.

He was succeeded by [[Gerald Ford]], whom he had appointed [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] after Spiro Agnew was forced to resign. Nixon took office after the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 presidential election]], in which he defeated incumbent Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]]. Although Nixon had built his reputation as a  very active [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican campaigner]], he downplayed partisanship in his 1972 landslide reelection.\n\nNixon's primary focus while in office was on foreign affairs. He focused on [[d\u00e9tente]] with the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Soviet Union]], easing [[Cold War]] tensions with both countries. As part of this policy, Nixon signed the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] and [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT]] I, two landmark arms control treaties with the [[Soviet Union]]. Nixon promulgated the [[Nixon Doctrine]], which called for indirect assistance by the United States rather than direct U.S. commitments as seen in the ongoing [[Vietnam War]]. After extensive negotiations with [[North Vietnam]], Nixon withdrew the last U.S. soldiers from [[South Vietnam]] in 1973, ending the military draft that same year. To prevent the possibility of further U.S. intervention in Vietnam, Congress passed the [[War Powers Resolution]] over Nixon's veto.\n\nIn domestic affairs, Nixon advocated a policy of \"[[New Federalism]],\" in which federal powers and responsibilities would be shifted to the [[U.S. state|states]]. However, he faced a Democratic Congress that did not share his goals and, in some cases, enacted legislation over his veto. Nixon's proposed reform of federal welfare programs did not pass Congress, but Congress did adopt one aspect of his proposal in the form of [[Supplemental Security Income]], which provides aid to low-income individuals who are aged or disabled. The Nixon administration adopted a \"low profile\" on school desegregation, but the administration enforced court desegregation orders and implemented the first [[affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]] plan in the United States. Nixon also presided over the creation of [[Environmental Protection Agency]] and the passage of major environmental laws like the [[Clean Water Act]]. Economically, the Nixon years saw the start of a period of \"[[stagflation]]\" that would continue into the 1970s.\n\nNixon was far ahead in the polls in the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential election]], but during the campaign, Nixon operatives conducted several illegal operations designed to undermine the opposition. They were exposed when the break-in of the [[Democratic National Committee]] Headquarters, ended in the arrest of five burglars and gave rise to a congressional investigation. Nixon denied any involvement in the break in, but, after a tape emerged revealing that Nixon had known about the White House connection to the Watergate burglaries shortly after they occurred, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] initiated impeachment proceedings. Facing removal by Congress, Nixon resigned from office. Though some scholars believe that Nixon \"has been excessively maligned for his faults and inadequately recognised for his virtues\",{{sfn|Aitken|p=577}} Nixon is generally ranked as a below average president in [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|surveys of historians and political scientists]].<ref name=\"brottinghaus\"/><ref name=\"Siena\"/><ref name=\"cspanrankings\"/>\n\n== Election of 1968 ==\n{{further|Republican Party presidential primaries, 1968|United States presidential election, 1968}}\n\n===Republican nomination===\n[[Richard Nixon]] had served as vice president from 1953 to 1961, and had been defeated in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential election]] by [[John F.

Chief of Staff [[H. R.

The United States and Soviet Union had been the clear leaders of their respective blocs of allies during the 1950s, but the world became increasingly multipolar during the 1960s. U.S. allies in Western Europe and East Asia had recovered economically, and while they remained allied with United States, they set their own foreign policies. The fracture in the so-called \"[[Second World]]\" of Communist states was more serious, as the [[Sino-Soviet split|split]] between the Soviet Union and [[China]] escalated into a [[Sino-Soviet border conflict|border conflict]] in 1969. The United States and the Soviet Union continued to compete for worldwide influence, but tensions had eased considerably since the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].

Chinese leaders, meanwhile, were receptive to closer relations with the U.S. for several reasons, including hostility to the Soviet Union, a desire for increased trade, and hopes of winning international recognition.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=775\u2013776}}\n\nBoth sides faced domestic pressures against closer relations. A conservative faction of Republicans led by [[Barry Goldwater]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] strongly opposed a rapprochement with China, while [[Lin Biao]] led a similar faction in the PRC. For the first two years of his presidency, Nixon and China each made subtle moves designed to lower tensions, including the removal of travel restrictions.

Through d\u00e9tente, he hoped to \"minimize confrontation in marginal areas and provide, at least, alternative possibilities in the major ones.\" [[West Germany]] had also pursued closer relations with the Soviet Union in a policy known as \"[[Ostpolitik]],\" and Nixon hoped to re-establish American dominance in [[NATO]] by taking the lead in negotiations with the Soviet Union. Nixon also believed that expanding trade with the Soviet Union would help the U.S. economy and could allow both countries to devote fewer resources to defense spending. For their part, the Soviets were motivated by a struggling economy and their ongoing split with China.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=770\u2013773}}\n\nUpon taking office, Nixon took several steps to signal to the Soviets his desire for negotiation. In his first press conference, he noted that the United States would accept nuclear parity, rather than superiority, with the Soviet Union. Kissinger conducted extensive backchannel talks with Soviet Ambassador [[Anatoly Dobrynin]] over arms control negotiations and potential Soviet assistance in negotiations with North Vietnam. Seeking a bargaining chip in negotiations, Nixon funded development of [[Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle|MIRV]]s, which were not easily countered by existing [[anti-ballistic missile]] (ABM) systems. Arms control negotiations would thus center over ABM systems, MIRVs, and the various components of each respective country's nuclear arsenal. After over a year of negotiations, both sides agreed to the outlines of two treaties; one treaty would focus on ABM systems, while the other would focus on limiting nuclear arsenals.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=773\u2013775}}\n\n[[File:\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0421\u0428\u0410 \u0420\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0440\u0434 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0441\u043e\u043d \u0432 1972 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443 \u0432 \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0435.jpg|thumb|right|Richard Nixon in [[Kiev]] in 1972]]\n\nIn May 1972, Nixon met with [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and other leading Soviet officials at the 1972 [[Moscow Summit (1972)|Moscow Summit]]. The two sides reached the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|Strategic Arms Limitation Agreement]] (SALT I), which set upper limits on the number of offensive missiles and [[ballistic missile submarine]]s that each county could maintain. A separate agreement, the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]], stipulated that each country could only field two anti-ballistic missile systems. The United States also agreed to the creation of the [[Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe]].{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=794\u2013795}} An October 1972 trade agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union vastly increased trade between the two countries, though Congress did not approve of Nixon's proposal to extend [[most favoured nation]] status to the Soviet Union.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=113\u2013115}}\n\nNixon would embark on a second trip to the Soviet Union in 1974, meeting with Brezhnev in [[Yalta]]. They discussed a proposed mutual defense pact and other issues, but there were no significant breakthroughs in the negotiations.{{sfn|Black|p=963}} During Nixon's final year in office, Congress undercut Nixon's d\u00e9tente policies by passing the [[Jackson\u2013Vanik amendment]].{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=803\u2013804}} Senator [[Henry M. Jackson]], an opponent of d\u00e9tente, introduced the Jackson\u2013Vanik amendment in response to a Soviet tax that curbed the flow of Jewish emigrants, many of whom sought to immigrate to Israel. Angered by the amendment, the Soviets canceled the 1972 trade agreement and reduced the number of Jews who were permitted to emigrate.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=115\u2013116}} Though d\u00e9tente was unpopular with many on the left due to humanitarian concerns, and with many on the right due to concerns about being overly accommodating to the Soviets, Nixon's policies helped significantly lower Cold War tensions even after he left office.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=116\u2013118}}\n\n=== Latin America ===\n[[File:Gustavo Diaz Ordaz Richard Nixon San Diego.jpg|thumb|Nixon and Mexican president [[Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz]] riding a presidential motorcade in San Diego, California, September 1970]]\n\n==== Cuba ====\nNixon had been a firm supporter of Kennedy in the 1961 [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] and 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]; on taking office he stepped up covert operations against Cuba and its president, [[Fidel Castro]]. He maintained close relations with the Cuban-American exile community through his friend, [[Bebe Rebozo]], who often suggested ways of irritating Castro. These activities concerned the Soviets and Cubans, who feared Nixon might attack Cuba in violation of the understanding between Kennedy and Khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis. In August 1970, the Soviets asked Nixon to reaffirm the agreement. Despite his hard line against Castro, Nixon agreed. The process\u2014which began in secret, but quickly leaked\u2014had not been completed when the U.S. deduced that the Soviets were expanding their base at the Cuban port of [[Cienfuegos]] in October 1970. A minor confrontation ensued, which was concluded with an understanding that the Soviets would not use Cienfuegos for submarines bearing ballistic missiles. The final round of diplomatic notes, reaffirming the 1962 accord, were exchanged in November.{{sfn|Ambrose 1989|pp=379\u2013383}}\n\n==== Chile ====\n{{Further|United States intervention in Chile}}\n\nLike his predecessors, Nixon was determined to prevent the rise of another Soviet-aligned state in [[Latin America]], and his administration was greatly distressed by the victory of Marxist candidate [[Salvador Allende]] in the [[Chilean presidential election, 1970|1970 Chilean presidential election]].{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=765\u2013766}} Nixon pursued a vigorous campaign of covert resistance to Allende, intended to first prevent Allende from taking office, called [[United States intervention in Chile#Track I|Track I]], and then when that failed, to provide a \"military solution\", called [[United States intervention in Chile#Track II|Track II]].<ref name=\"Overthrow\">{{cite book|last=Kinzer|first=Stephen|title=Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq|year=2006|publisher=Times Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8050-8240-1|url=https://archive.org/details/overthrow00step}}</ref> As part of Track II, CIA operatives approached senior Chilean military leaders, using [[false flag]] operatives, and encouraged a coup d'\u00e9tat, providing both finances and weapons.<ref name=\"Legacy of Ashes\">{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Tim|title=Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA|year=2007|publisher=Anchor Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-38900-8|page=361}}</ref> These efforts failed, and Allende took office in November 1970.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=787\u2013788}}\n\nThe Nixon administration drastically cut economic aid to Chile and convinced [[World Bank]] leaders to block aid to Chile.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|p=788}} Extensive covert efforts continued as the U.S. funded [[black propaganda]], organized strikes against Allende, and provided funding for Allende opponents.

After the Soviet Union upped arms shipments to [[Egypt]] in mid-1970, Nixon moved closer to Israel, authorizing the shipment of [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4]] [[fighter aircraft]].{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=799\u2013801}} In October 1973, after Israel declined Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]]'s offer of negotiations over the lands it had won control of in the Six-Day War, Egypt and [[Syria]] launched a surprise attack against Israel. After Egypt and Syria experienced early successes in what became known as the [[Yom Kippur War]], the United States began to supply massive amounts of military aid to Israel, as Nixon overrode Kissinger's early reluctance to provide strong support to Israel. After Israel turned the tide in the war and advanced into Egypt and Syria, Kissinger and Brezhnev organized a cease fire. Cutting out the Soviet Union from further involvement, Kissinger helped arrange agreements between Israel and the Arab states.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=804\u2013807}}\n\n[[File:Nixons with Golda Meir cropped.jpg|thumb|Richard and [[Pat Nixon]] with Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]], 1973]]\n\nThough it had been established in 1960, [[OPEC]] did not gain effective control over oil prices until 1970, when [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] forced oil companies in Libya to agree to a price increase; other countries followed suit. U.S. leaders did not attempt to block these price increases, as they believed that higher prices would help increase domestic production of oil. This increased production failed to materialize, and by 1973 the U.S. consumed over one and a half times the oil that it produced domestically.{{Sfn|Small|1999|p=138}} In 1973, in response to the U.S. support of Israel in the Yom Kippur War, OPEC countries cut oil production, raised prices, and initiated an [[embargo]] targeted against the United States and other countries that had supported Israel.{{sfn|Black|pp=923\u2013928}} The embargo caused gasoline shortages and rationing in the United States in late 1973, but was eventually ended by the oil-producing nations as the Yom Kippur War peace took hold.{{sfn|Ambrose 1991|p=311}}\n\n=== Europe===\n\nJust weeks after his 1969 inauguration, Nixon made an eight-day trip to Europe.

He also made groundbreaking trips to several Eastern European nations, including [[Romania]], [[Yugoslavia]], and [[Poland]]. However, the NATO allies of the United States generally did not play a large role in Nixon's foreign policy, as he focused on the Vietnam War and d\u00e9tente. In 1971, the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union reached the [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin|Four Power Agreement]], in which the Soviet Union guaranteed access to [[West Berlin]] so long as it was not incorporated into West Germany.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=779\u2013781}}\n\n===List of international trips===\nNixon made fifteen international trips to 42 different countries during his presidency.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/travels/president/nixon-richard-m|title= Travels of President Richard M.

Nixon became closely involved in the proposal and, despite opposition from Arthur Burns and other conservatives, adopted Moynihan's plan as the central legislative proposal of his first year in office.

While based upon the 1908 Canadian novel ''[[Anne of Green Gables]]'', its inclusion of original storylines that highlight implied trauma in the source material led to a screenplay that differs in tone from previous adaptations. The series was adapted by Emmy Award winning writer and producer [[Moira Walley-Beckett]], and stars [[Amybeth McNulty]] as [[Anne Shirley]], [[Geraldine James]] as Marilla Cuthbert,  [[R. H. Thomson]] as Matthew Cuthbert, and [[Lucas Jade Zumann]] as [[Gilbert Blythe]].\n\nIt aired on [[CBC Television|CBC]] in Canada and was later made available for streaming on [[Netflix]]. The series premiered on March 19, 2017, on CBC and on May 12 internationally. It was renewed for a second season (changing the name of the series to ''Anne with an E'') on August 3, 2017, and for a third season in August 2018. Shortly after the third season was released in Fall 2019, CBC and Netflix announced that the series was canceled.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn the [[1890s]], brother and sister Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, both of whom never married and are past their prime, decide to adopt an orphan boy from a local orphanage to help out around their ancestral farm of [[Green Gables (Prince Edward Island)|Green Gables]], on the outskirts of the town of [[Avonlea (Anne of Green Gables)|Avonlea]], [[Prince Edward Island]]. When Matthew goes to pick the child up at the railway station, he finds [[Anne Shirley]], an imaginative, bright, high-spirited, and talkative girl, instead (an orphan since her parents died when she was a few months old, Anne lived as a servant in various households before being placed in an orphan asylum). \n\nWhile Matthew decides he would like for her to stay, Marilla doesn't trust Anne, given her status as an unknown orphan, and the perceived uselessness of a young girl. Her distrust appears confirmed when Marilla cannot locate a brooch, thus leading her to believe that Anne is a thief. The Cuthberts send her away, thus \"returning\" her to the orphanage. While she does arrive back at the orphanage, she is terrified to enter, haunted by bullying she had endured there, and returns to the train station. Meanwhile, Marilla discovers that the brooch had been misplaced rather than lost, and that prejudice had led her to believe Anne was a thief. Matthew consequently finds Anne and convinces her to return to Green Gables, where she is officially made part of their family. However, Anne continues to face bullying from students in the Avonlea school, and class-based discrimination from Diana's parents and others in Avolea. Anne once again returns to her survival mechanisms of imagination, intelligence, and problem solving abilities that eventually lead to her acceptance by the rest of the community.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Amybeth McNulty]] as [[Anne Shirley]]<ref name=cast>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/10/netflix-anne-of-green-gables-cast-anne-shirley-marilla-matthew-1201840328/|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|title=Netflix's 'Anne of Green Gables' Adaptation Finds Its Anne Shirley, Casts 2 Other Roles|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|date=October 21, 2016|accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Geraldine James]] as Marilla Cuthbert<ref name=cast/>\n* [[R.

While based upon the 1908 Canadian novel ''[[Anne of Green Gables]]'', its inclusion of original storylines that highlight implied trauma in the source material led to a screenplay that differs in tone from previous adaptations. The series was adapted by Emmy Award winning writer and producer [[Moira Walley-Beckett]], and stars [[Amybeth McNulty]] as [[Anne Shirley]], [[Geraldine James]] as Marilla Cuthbert,  [[R. H. Thomson]] as Matthew Cuthbert, and [[Lucas Jade Zumann]] as [[Gilbert Blythe]].\n\nIt aired on [[CBC Television|CBC]] in Canada and was later made available for streaming on [[Netflix]]. The series premiered on March 19, 2017, on CBC and on May 12 internationally. It was renewed for a second season (changing the name of the series to ''Anne with an E'') on August 3, 2017, and for a third season in August 2018. Shortly after the third season was released in Fall 2019, CBC and Netflix announced that the series was canceled.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn the [[1890s]], brother and sister Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, both of whom never married and are past their prime, decide to adopt an orphan boy from a local orphanage to help out around their ancestral farm of [[Green Gables (Prince Edward Island)|Green Gables]], on the outskirts of the town of [[Avonlea (Anne of Green Gables)|Avonlea]], [[Prince Edward Island]]. When Matthew goes to pick the child up at the railway station, he finds [[Anne Shirley]], an imaginative, bright, high-spirited, and talkative girl, instead (an orphan since her parents died when she was a few months old, Anne lived as a servant in various households before being placed in an orphan asylum). \n\nWhile Matthew decides he would like for her to stay, Marilla doesn't trust Anne, given her status as an unknown orphan, and the perceived uselessness of a young girl. Her distrust appears confirmed when Marilla cannot locate a brooch, thus leading her to believe that Anne is a thief. The Cuthberts send her away, thus \"returning\" her to the orphanage. While she does arrive back at the orphanage, she is terrified to enter, haunted by bullying she had endured there, and returns to the train station. Meanwhile, Marilla discovers that the brooch had been misplaced rather than lost, and that prejudice had led her to believe Anne was a thief. Matthew consequently finds Anne and convinces her to return to Green Gables, where she is officially made part of their family. However, Anne continues to face bullying from students in the Avonlea school, and class-based discrimination from Diana's parents and others in Avolea.

For classical and operatic singers, their voice type determines the roles they will sing and is a primary method of categorization. In classical music, a \"pure\" contralto is considered the rarest type of female voice.<ref>{{cite book|title=Songs that Never Die: Being a Collection of the Most Famous Words and Melodies Enriched with Valuable Historical and Biographical Sketches of Renowned Authors and Composers|author=Buck, Dudley, ed.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KwpAAQAAMAAJ&dq|year=1892|p=23|publisher=B.F.

Released in August 1992, it was the first single from their sixth album, ''[[Please Yourself]]'' which shipped in April 1993. This is also the first single released by Bananarama as a duo, as [[Jacquie O'Sullivan]] had left the group the prior year. It was produced by [[Mike Stock (musician)|Mike Stock]] and [[Pete Waterman]], two-thirds of the [[Stock Aitken Waterman]] (SAW) trio who had produced a bulk of Bananarama's past hits.\n\n\"Movin' On\" is a pop song with [[disco]] influences, as Stock and Waterman attempted to create an [[ABBA]]-like sound for the ''Please Yourself'' album.  The single met with mixed reviews and moderate success when released, peaking at number 24 in the [[UK singles chart]]. The song was later [[cover version|covered]] by Englisg band [[Steps (group)|Steps]] on their second album, ''[[Steptacular]]''.\n\nIn 2012, the song was re-released by Bananarama on their [[Now or Never (Bananarama EP)|Now or Never]] EP in a new version.\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]], directed by Philippe Gautier, begins with the girls performing from behind a wooden cut-out of the image that appears on the cover of the single. They emerge from behind it in red evening gowns and descend a staircase as scantily clad showboys with feathered fans perform around them. Several muscular men pose on podiums as live Grecian statues. \n\nAs a nod to their trademark silliness, they can be seen tussling in the midst of their choreographed descent down the stairs.\n\nAt the end, the duo make a languid exit down the long runway of a stage, and then reappear from behind the wooden cut-outs, to the sound of applause.\n\n==Remixes==\n#\"Movin' On\" (Album Version) - (4:36)\n\n; UK CD 1 single\n#\"Movin' On\" (7\" Mix) - (3:32)\n#\"Movin' On\" (Bumpin' Mix) - (6:15)\n#:<small>Remixed by CJ Mackintosh</small>\n#\"Treat Me Right\" - (4:41)\n#\"Movin' On\" (Spag-A-Nana Dub) - (6:17)\n\n; UK CD 2 single\n#\"Movin' On\" (Straight No Chaser)\n#\"Movin' On\" (Bumpin' Mix) - (6:15)\n#:<small>Remixed by CJ Mackintosh</small>\n#\"Movin' On\" (Spag-a-Nana Dub) - (6:17)\n#\"Treat Me Right\" - (4:41)\n\n==Charts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1992)\n!align=\"left\"|Peak<br>position\n|-\n|Australia ([[ARIA Charts|ARIA Chart]])<ref name=aus>{{cite web|url=http://i.imgur.com/9AQCjII.jpg|title=Response from ARIA re: chart inquiry, received 2014-06-17|accessdate=2015-09-19|publisher=imgur.com}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|177\n|-\n|Belgium ([[Ultratop]] Flanders)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://swedishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Bananarama&|title=BANANARAMA - MOVIN' ON (SONG)|publisher=swedishcharts.com|accessdate=2020-02-22}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|33\n|-\n|Finland ([[IFPI Finland|IFPI]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/90s/1992/MM-1992-09-26.pdf|title=Top 10 Sales in Europe|magazine=[[Music & Media]]|volume=9|issue=39|page=18|date=1992-09-26|accessdate=2020-02-22}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|6\n|-\n|Germany ([[Official German Charts]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://swedishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Bananarama&|title=BANANARAMA - MOVIN' ON (SONG)|publisher=swedishcharts.com|accessdate=2020-02-22}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|52\n|-\n|Netherlands ([[Dutch Top 40]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.top40.nl/bananarama/bananarama-movin-on-5527|title=Bananarama - Movin' On|publisher=top40.nl|accessdate=2020-02-22}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|32\n|-\n|Netherlands ([[MegaCharts]])\n|align=\"center\"|34\n|-\n|[[UK Singles Chart]] ([[Official Charts Company]]) \n|align=\"center\"|24\n|-\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Bananarama}}\n{{Steps}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Movin' On (Bananarama Song)}}\n[[Category:1992 singles]]\n[[Category:2012 songs]]\n[[Category:Bananarama songs]]\n[[Category:London Records singles]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Mike Stock (musician)]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Pete Waterman]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Sara Dallin]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Keren Woodward]]\n[[Category:1992 songs]]\n\n\n{{1990s-pop-song-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2019}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2019}}\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Movin' On\n| cover      = Banana_mo.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Bananarama]]\n| album      = [[Please Yourself]]\n| released   = August 1992\n| format     = \n*7\" single\n*12\" single\n*CD single\n| recorded   = July 1991\n| studio     =\n| B-side     = \"Treat Me Right\"\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[Electronic dance music|Dance]]\n| length     = \n*4:36\n*3:31 (7\" Mix)\n| label      = [[London Records]]\n| writer     = \n*[[Sara Dallin]]\n*[[Keren Woodward]]\n*[[Mike Stock (musician)|Mike Stock]]\n*[[Pete Waterman]]\n| producer   = \n*Mike Stock\n*Pete Waterman\n| prev_title = [[Tripping on Your Love]]\n| prev_year  = 1991\n| next_title = [[Last Thing on My Mind (Bananarama song)|Last Thing on My Mind]]\n| next_year  = 1992\n| misc       = {{External music video|{{YouTube|LFgtPJwU8yQ|\"Movin' On\"}}}}\n}}\n\n\"''''Movin' On'''\" is a song written and recorded by English [[girl group]] [[Bananarama]].

Several muscular men pose on podiums as live Grecian statues. \n\nAs a nod to their trademark silliness, they can be seen tussling in the midst of their choreographed descent down the stairs.\n\nAt the end, the duo make a languid exit down the long runway of a stage, and then reappear from behind the wooden cut-outs, to the sound of applause.\n\n==Remixes==\n#\"Movin' On\" (Album Version) - (4:36)\n\n; UK CD 1 single\n#\"Movin' On\" (7\" Mix) - (3:32)\n#\"Movin' On\" (Bumpin' Mix) - (6:15)\n#:<small>Remixed by CJ Mackintosh</small>\n#\"Treat Me Right\" - (4:41)\n#\"Movin' On\" (Spag-A-Nana Dub) - (6:17)\n\n; UK CD 2 single\n#\"Movin' On\" (Straight No Chaser)\n#\"Movin' On\" (Bumpin' Mix) - (6:15)\n#:<small>Remixed by CJ Mackintosh</small>\n#\"Movin' On\" (Spag-a-Nana Dub) - (6:17)\n#\"Treat Me Right\" - (4:41)\n\n==Charts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1992)\n!align=\"left\"|Peak<br>position\n|-\n|Australia ([[ARIA Charts|ARIA Chart]])<ref name=aus>{{cite web|url=http://i.imgur.com/9AQCjII.jpg|title=Response from ARIA re: chart inquiry, received 2014-06-17|accessdate=2015-09-19|publisher=imgur.com}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|177\n|-\n|Belgium ([[Ultratop]] Flanders)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://swedishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Bananarama&|title=BANANARAMA - MOVIN' ON (SONG)|publisher=swedishcharts.com|accessdate=2020-02-22}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|33\n|-\n|Finland ([[IFPI Finland|IFPI]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/90s/1992/MM-1992-09-26.pdf|title=Top 10 Sales in Europe|magazine=[[Music & Media]]|volume=9|issue=39|page=18|date=1992-09-26|accessdate=2020-02-22}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|6\n|-\n|Germany ([[Official German Charts]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://swedishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Bananarama&|title=BANANARAMA - MOVIN' ON (SONG)|publisher=swedishcharts.com|accessdate=2020-02-22}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|52\n|-\n|Netherlands ([[Dutch Top 40]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.top40.nl/bananarama/bananarama-movin-on-5527|title=Bananarama - Movin' On|publisher=top40.nl|accessdate=2020-02-22}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|32\n|-\n|Netherlands ([[MegaCharts]])\n|align=\"center\"|34\n|-\n|[[UK Singles Chart]] ([[Official Charts Company]]) \n|align=\"center\"|24\n|-\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Bananarama}}\n{{Steps}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Movin' On (Bananarama Song)}}\n[[Category:1992 singles]]\n[[Category:2012 songs]]\n[[Category:Bananarama songs]]\n[[Category:London Records singles]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Mike Stock (musician)]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Pete Waterman]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Sara Dallin]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Keren Woodward]]\n[[Category:1992 songs]]\n\n\n{{1990s-pop-song-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Bananarama official", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movin%27_On_(Bananarama_song)"}

During fighting between the Christian Spaniards and the Muslims in [[Granada]], the Spanish lost 3,000 to war casualties, and 20,000 to typhus. In 1528, the French lost 18,000 troops in [[Italy]], and lost supremacy in Italy to the Spanish.

Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from [[Masked palm civet|civet cats]] to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, [[fever]], [[cough]], shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of infection include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.\n\n==== Severe acute respiratory syndrome ====\n\nIn 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956\u20132003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated and could re-emerge.

Such a subtype could cause a global influenza pandemic, similar to the [[Spanish flu]] or the lower mortality pandemics such as the [[Asian Flu]] and the [[Hong Kong Flu]].\n\nFrom October 2004 to February 2005, some 3,700 test kits of the 1957 [[Asian Flu]] virus were accidentally spread around the world from a lab in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |author=MacKenzie, D |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7261 |title=Pandemic-causing 'Asian flu' accidentally released |date=13 April 2005 |work=New Scientist }}</ref>\n\nIn May 2005, scientists urgently called upon nations to prepare for a global influenza pandemic that could strike as much as 20% of the world's population.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/may/25/birdflu |title=Flu pandemic 'could hit 20% of world's population' |work=guardian.co.uk |date=25 May 2005 | location=London | accessdate=21 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2005, cases of the avian flu (the deadly strain [[H5N1]]) were identified in [[Turkey]]. EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou said: \"We have received now confirmation that the virus found in Turkey is an avian flu H5N1 virus. There is a direct relationship with viruses found in Russia, Mongolia and China.\" Cases of bird flu were also identified shortly thereafter in [[Romania]], and then [[Greece]]. Possible cases of the virus have also been found in [[Croatia]], [[Bulgaria]] and the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4348404.stm |title=Bird flu is confirmed in Greece |work=BBC News |date=17 October 2005 | accessdate=3 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nBy November 2007, numerous confirmed cases of the [[H5N1]] strain had been identified across Europe.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/world/05/bird_flu_map/html/1.stm |title=Bird Flu Map |work=BBC News | accessdate=3 January 2010}}</ref> However, by the end of October, only 59 people had died as a result of H5N1, which was atypical of previous influenza pandemics.\n\nAvian flu cannot be categorized as a \"pandemic\" because the virus cannot yet cause sustained and efficient human-to-human transmission. Cases so far are recognized to have been transmitted from bird to human, but as of December 2006 there had been few (if any) cases of proven human-to-human transmission.<ref>WHO (2005).

After a protracted siege, during which the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] army under [[Jani Beg]] was suffering the disease, they catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls to infect the inhabitants.

In February 2020, a WHO spokesperson clarified that \"there is no official category [for a pandemic]\".{{efn|For clarification, WHO does not use the old system of six phases\u2014ranging from phase{{nbsp}}1 (no reports of animal influenza causing human infections) to phase{{nbsp}}6 (a pandemic)\u2014that some people may be familiar with from H1N1 in 2009.}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-health-who-idUKKCN20I0PD|title=WHO says it no longer uses 'pandemic' category, but virus still emergency|date=24 February 2020|work=Reuters|access-date=29 February 2020|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn a virtual press conference in May 2009 on the influenza pandemic, Dr. Keiji Fukuda, Assistant Director-General ''ad interim'' for Health Security and Environment, WHO said \"An easy way to think about pandemic{{nbsp}}... is to say: a pandemic is a global outbreak.

In addition, infections caused by community-acquired strains of methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]) in otherwise healthy individuals have become more frequent in recent years. <!-- Antibiotics are not described as \"strongest\"; each has a specific range of activity.

Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from [[Masked palm civet|civet cats]] to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, [[fever]], [[cough]], shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of infection include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.\n\n==== Severe acute respiratory syndrome ====\n\nIn 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956\u20132003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated and could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr56/en/|title=WHO &#124; SARS outbreak contained worldwide|website=WHO}}\nbe safe be active</ref>\n\n=== Influenza ===\n\n{{Main|Influenza pandemic}}\n\nWild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of [[influenza]] A viruses.

With Henry now operating in Dystopia, Captain Man and Schwoz open up the Swellview Academy of the Gifted where they get Chapa, Miles, Mika, and Bose as their students ever since they were exposed to the energies of the Omega Weapon. Schwoz has been teaching the kids the L.I.E. (short for Lying is Everything) to conceal their secret identity. After a comical drill, the Danger Force learns that Swellview is in the middle of a crime drought. When Captain Man is called somewhere, he claims that he is visiting to them as a way to fight crime. Later that night, Captain Man zaps the different news people to keep the Danger Force about stopping the theft of a goat who says \"but.\" The Danger Force figures out that Captain Man has been lying about the crime drought. Due to the accusations of lying, Captain Man does another cover-up as he goes to prevent a kid named Crank and his two followers from freeing their grandfather from Swellview Prison. The Danger Force teleports to Swellview Prison where they try to help fight the bad guys.

With Henry now operating in Dystopia, Captain Man and Schwoz open up the Swellview Academy of the Gifted where they get Chapa, Miles, Mika, and Bose as their students ever since they were exposed to the energies of the Omega Weapon. Schwoz has been teaching the kids the L.I.E. (short for Lying is Everything) to conceal their secret identity. After a comical drill, the Danger Force learns that Swellview is in the middle of a crime drought. When Captain Man is called somewhere, he claims that he is visiting to them as a way to fight crime. Later that night, Captain Man zaps the different news people to keep the Danger Force about stopping the theft of a goat who says \"but.\" The Danger Force figures out that Captain Man has been lying about the crime drought. Due to the accusations of lying, Captain Man does another cover-up as he goes to prevent a kid named Crank and his two followers from freeing their grandfather from Swellview Prison. The Danger Force teleports to Swellview Prison where they try to help fight the bad guys. Due to the Danger Force have not yet controlled their powers and Mika's powers finally manifesting, they mess up in the first battle and accidentally free the Toddler, Frankini, Goomer, the Beekeeper, Dr. Minyak, Jeff, the Time Jerker, Jack Frittleman, the Thumb Buddies, and other unnamed criminals from Swellview Prison. As the Danger Force agrees with Captain Man that they need more training, Frankini keeps going around due to the costumes that he smuggled into Swellview Prison.\n| LineColor       = F46D25\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| Title           = Say My Name\n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|4}}\n| ProdCode        = 103\n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = <!-- Episode summaries must be expressed in your own words.
