The megacorporations have subsequently been infiltrated and overtaken by corrupt crime Syndicates, fighting for global control.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|url=http://syndicate.lubiki.pl/downloads/synd_docs/synd_manual_pc_usa_release.pdf|title=Syndicate - Manual (USA PC)|last=|first=|publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=3\u20136, 51\u201353}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://syndicate.lubiki.pl/downloads/swars_docs/swars_official_guide_part1of7.pdf|title=Bullfrog's Official Guide to Syndicate Wars (Part 1)|last=Tyler|first=Melissa|publisher=[[Prima Games|Prima Publishing]]|year=1996|isbn=0-7615-0089-8|location=United States of America|pages=|lccn=96-68003}}</ref>\n\nThe player is placed in charge one such corporation, for which they choose a name and [[logo]]. During the course of the game, as missions for the player's corporation are completed by teams of cyborg enforcers (known as \"agents\"), it gains global dominance over its competitors.\n\n''Syndicate Wars'' is set 95 years after the original game (in the year 2191), when ''EuroCorp'' holds full global control, using CHIP technology to influence the population. At this point, the release of a virus into the global communications network leads to CHIP failures, resulting in the emergence of armed insurrectionists, referred to as \"unguided citizens\". The group responsible for the viral attack is a militant religious organisation, named the ''Church of the New Epoch''.\n\nThe game's instruction manual specifically addresses the player as a newly hired ''EuroCorp'' executive;<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://syndicate.lubiki.pl/downloads/swars_docs/swars_pc_manual_usa_release.pdf|title=Syndicate Wars - Manual|last=|first=|publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> however, they can choose to control agents from either ''EuroCorp'' (to suppress uprisings resulting from the virus outbreak) or the ''Church of the New Epoch'' (to seize power from ''EuroCorp'').\n\nThe game ends with a battle for control of [[ionosphere]] calibration equipment on [[Moon|the moon]], which the Church's leaders intend to use in eliminating life on Earth; however (regardless of which faction the player chooses to play as), the leaders are eliminated before this plan can be executed.\n\n=== ''Syndicate'' (2012) ===\nThe plot of the later ''Syndicate'' game renames the CHIP technology to the \"DART chip\", and introduces the concept of the \"unchipped\", a proportion of the world's population who declined the use of this technology. The game is set in the year 2069 (prior to the original games), at which point, ''EuroCorp'' is already an established global mecorporation.\n\nThe main story focuses on a specific agent, named Miles Kilo. Kilo uncovers a plot from a rival corporation, ''Aspari'', to begin a war against ''EuroCorp'', before discovering that ''EuroCorp'' killed his family, abducted him as a baby and modified his memory. The game ends with the apparent downfall of ''EuroCorp''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nGameplay for the original ''Syndicate'' games involved ordering a team of four [[cyborg]] agents around gritty [[cyberpunk]]-themed cities, in pursuit of mission goals, such as assassinating executives of a rival syndicate, rescuing captured allies, \"persuading\" civilians and scientists to join the corporation/church, demolishing buildings, or killing enemy agents. Unlike some games, which either punish the player for civilian deaths or reward them for violent actions committed, ''Syndicate'' remains indifferent. The player must collect funds to finance the research and development of new weaponry and cyborg upgrades, such as by taxing conquered territories (in the original game) or robbing banks (in ''Syndicate Wars'').\n\nNotable features of both original games are the use of context-sensitive background music, which changes to suit the mood of the on-screen action, and a high degree of interactivity: many objects in the first game, and nearly every object in the second game, can be destroyed. The visual aesthetic of these games borrows heavily from films such as ''[[Blade Runner]]''.\n\nThe gameplay of the 2012 ''Syndicate'' game did not include the same real-time tactics and strategy elements as the previous games, instead following a typical [[first-person shooter]] format.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Cite book|title=Bullfrog's Official Guide to Syndicate Wars|last=Tyler|first=Melissa|publisher=[[Prima Games|Prima Publishing]]|year=1996|isbn=0-7615-0089-8|location=United States of America|pages=|lccn=96-68003}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/?p=1020 ''Syndicate'' retrospective] by [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]\n\n{{Bullfrog Productions}}\n\n[[Category:Bullfrog Productions games]]\n[[Category:Electronic Arts franchises]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises]]\n[[Category:Cyberpunk video games]]\n[[Category:Organized crime video games]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises introduced in 1993]]\n\n[[cs:Syndicate]]\n[[it:Syndicate]]\n[[ru:Syndicate]]\n[[fi:Syndicate]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Video game series}}\n{{Infobox video game series\n| title                  = Syndicate\n| image                  = Syndicate.png\n| caption                = PC DOS version of ''Syndicate''.\n| platforms              = [[MS-DOS]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Amiga]], [[Amiga CD32]], [[Apple Macintosh|Mac]], [[Sega Genesis]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]], [[Atari Jaguar]], [[Acorn Archimedes]], [[FM Towns]], [[NEC PC-9801]], [[Sega-CD]], [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]]\n| developer              = [[Bullfrog Productions]], [[Ocean Software]], [[Starbreeze Studios]]\n| publisher              =[[Electronic Arts]] \n| genre                  = [[Real-time tactics]], [[First-person shooter]]\n| spinoffs               = \n| creator                = \n| artist                 = \n| writer                 = \n| composer               = \n| first release version  = ''[[Syndicate (video game)|Syndicate]]''\n| first release date     = {{Start date and age|1993}}\n| latest release version =''[[Syndicate (2012 video game)|Syndicate]]'' \n| latest release date    ={{Start date and age|2012|02|21|df=yes}} \n}}\nThe '''''Syndicate''''' series is a series of [[science fiction]] [[video game]]s created by [[Bullfrog Productions]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]].

As outlined in the game's [[Video game packaging#Instruction manuals|instruction manual]], [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[megacorporation]]<nowiki/>s, have replaced global governments and one such corporation, named ''EuroCorp'', have established the \"CHIP\": a device inserted into a person's neck which alters their perception (\"numbing their senses to the misery and squalor around them\") and allows them to be directly manipulated. The megacorporations have subsequently been infiltrated and overtaken by corrupt crime Syndicates, fighting for global control.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|url=http://syndicate.lubiki.pl/downloads/synd_docs/synd_manual_pc_usa_release.pdf|title=Syndicate - Manual (USA PC)|last=|first=|publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=3\u20136, 51\u201353}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://syndicate.lubiki.pl/downloads/swars_docs/swars_official_guide_part1of7.pdf|title=Bullfrog's Official Guide to Syndicate Wars (Part 1)|last=Tyler|first=Melissa|publisher=[[Prima Games|Prima Publishing]]|year=1996|isbn=0-7615-0089-8|location=United States of America|pages=|lccn=96-68003}}</ref>\n\nThe player is placed in charge one such corporation, for which they choose a name and [[logo]]. During the course of the game, as missions for the player's corporation are completed by teams of cyborg enforcers (known as \"agents\"), it gains global dominance over its competitors.\n\n''Syndicate Wars'' is set 95 years after the original game (in the year 2191), when ''EuroCorp'' holds full global control, using CHIP technology to influence the population. At this point, the release of a virus into the global communications network leads to CHIP failures, resulting in the emergence of armed insurrectionists, referred to as \"unguided citizens\". The group responsible for the viral attack is a militant religious organisation, named the ''Church of the New Epoch''.\n\nThe game's instruction manual specifically addresses the player as a newly hired ''EuroCorp'' executive;<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://syndicate.lubiki.pl/downloads/swars_docs/swars_pc_manual_usa_release.pdf|title=Syndicate Wars - Manual|last=|first=|publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> however, they can chose to control agents from either ''EuroCorp'' (to suppress uprisings resulting from the virus outbreak) or the ''Church of the New Epoch'' (to seize power from ''EuroCorp'').\n\nThe game ends with a battle for control of [[ionosphere]] calibration equipment on [[Moon|the moon]], which the Church's leaders intend to use in eliminating life on Earth; however (regardless of which faction the player chooses to play as), the leaders are eliminated before this plan can be executed.\n\n=== ''Syndicate'' (2012) ===\nThe plot of the later ''Syndicate'' game renames the CHIP technology to the \"DART chip\", and introduces the concept of the \"unchipped\", a proportion of the world's population who declined the use of this technology. The game is set in the year 2069 (prior to the original games), at which point, ''EuroCorp'' is already an established global mecorporation.\n\nThe main story focuses on a specific agent, named Miles Kilo. Kilo uncovers a plot from a rival corporation, ''Aspari'', to begin a war against ''EuroCorp'', before discovering that ''EuroCorp'' killed his family, abducted him as a baby and modified his memory. The game ends with the apparent downfall of ''EuroCorp''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nGameplay for the original ''Syndicate'' games involved ordering a team of four [[cyborg]] agents around gritty [[cyberpunk]]-themed cities, in pursuit of mission goals, such as assassinating executives of a rival syndicate, rescuing captured allies, \"persuading\" civilians and scientists to join the corporation/church, demolishing buildings, or killing enemy agents. Unlike some games, which either punish the player for civilian deaths or reward them for violent actions committed, ''Syndicate'' remains indifferent. The player must collect funds to finance the research and development of new weaponry and cyborg upgrades, such as by taxing conquered territories (in the original game) or robbing banks (in ''Syndicate Wars'').\n\nNotable features of both original games are the use of context-sensitive background music, which changes to suit the mood of the on-screen action, and a high degree of interactivity: many objects in the first game, and nearly every object in the second game, can be destroyed. The visual aesthetic of these games borrows heavily from films such as ''[[Blade Runner]]''.\n\nThe gameplay of the 2012 ''Syndicate'' game did not include the same real-time tactics and strategy elements as the previous games, instead following a typical [[first-person shooter]] format.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Cite book|title=Bullfrog's Official Guide to Syndicate Wars|last=Tyler|first=Melissa|publisher=[[Prima Games|Prima Publishing]]|year=1996|isbn=0-7615-0089-8|location=United States of America|pages=|lccn=96-68003}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/?p=1020 ''Syndicate'' retrospective] by [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]\n\n{{Bullfrog Productions}}\n\n[[Category:Bullfrog Productions games]]\n[[Category:Electronic Arts franchises]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises]]\n[[Category:Cyberpunk video games]]\n[[Category:Organized crime video games]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises introduced in 1993]]\n\n[[cs:Syndicate]]\n[[it:Syndicate]]\n[[ru:Syndicate]]\n[[fi:Syndicate]]\n", "name_user": "WereSpielChequers", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e''Syndicate'' (1993) and ''Syndicate Wars'':Typo fixing, replaced: can chose \u2192 can choose", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndicate_(series)"}

Stated simply, it is the idea that if there are '''a''' ways of doing something and '''b''' ways of doing another thing, then there are '''a'''&nbsp;\u00b7&nbsp;'''b''' ways of performing both actions.<ref name=transition>Johnston, William, and Alex McAllister. ''A transition to advanced mathematics''. Oxford Univ. Press, 2009. Section 5.1</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtamu.edu/academic/anns/mps/math/mathlab/col_algebra/col_alg_tut55_count.htm|title=College Algebra Tutorial 55: Fundamental Counting Principle|accessdate= December 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\n& \\underbrace{ \\left\\{A,B,C\\right\\} }\n& & \\underbrace{ \\left\\{ X,Y\\right\\} } \\\\\n\\mathrm{To}\\ \\mathrm{choose}\\ \\mathrm{one}\\ \\mathrm{of} & \\mathrm{these} &\n\\mathrm{AND}\\ \\mathrm{one}\\ \\mathrm{of} & \\mathrm{these}\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\mathrm{is}\\ \\mathrm{to}\\ \\mathrm{choose}\\ \\mathrm{one}\\ \\mathrm{of} & \\mathrm{these}. \\\\\n& \\overbrace{ \\left\\{ AX, AY, BX, BY, CX, CY \\right\\} }\n\\end{matrix}</math>\n\nIn this example, the rule says: multiply 3 by 2, getting 6.\n\nThe sets {''A'', ''B'', ''C''} and {''X'', ''Y''} in this example are [[disjoint sets]], but that is not necessary.  The number of ways to choose a member of {''A'', ''B'', ''C''}, and then to do so again, in effect choosing an [[ordered pair]] each of whose components are in {''A'', ''B'', ''C''}, is 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;9.\n\nAs another example, when you decide to order pizza, you must first choose the type of crust: thin or deep dish (2 choices). Next, you choose one topping: cheese, pepperoni, or sausage (3&nbsp;choices).\n\nUsing the rule of product, you know that there are 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;6 possible combinations of ordering a pizza.\n\nOther typical example is using it with the [[rule of sum]], in this case we have two groups, the group '''A''' with '''3''' elements and the group '''B''' with '''10''' elements.

The number of ways to choose a member of {''A'', ''B'', ''C''}, and then to do so again, in effect choosing an [[ordered pair]] each of whose components are in {''A'', ''B'', ''C''}, is 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;9.\n\nAs another example, when you decide to order pizza, you must first choose the type of crust: thin or deep dish (2 choices). Next, you choose one topping: cheese, pepperoni, or sausage (3&nbsp;choices).\n\nUsing the rule of product, you know that there are 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;6 possible combinations of ordering a pizza.\n\nOther typical example is using it with the [[rule of sum]], in this case we have two groups, the group '''A''' with '''3''' elements and the group '''B''' with '''10''' elements. We want to pick one element ( we don't care if it is from group A or B) and a second element that must be from the group B. The way that we can chose the elements are:\n\n:<math>\n\\mathrm{Total}\\ \\mathrm{ways} = (3*10) + (10*9)\n</math>\n\nFirst, we use the rule of product to get the number of ways if we pick an element from group '''A''' and then from group '''B'''.

It was used during the 19th century by [[Great Plains]] pioneers who were seeking fertile land in the West and North.\n\nAs the trail developed it became marked by numerous cutoffs and shortcuts from Missouri to Oregon. The basic route follows river valleys as grass and water were absolutely necessary.\n\nWhile the first few parties organized and departed from Elm Grove, the Oregon Trail's primary starting point was [[Independence, Missouri]], or [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] (Missouri), on the Missouri River. Later, several feeder trails led across [[Kansas]], and some towns became starting points, including [[Weston, Missouri]], [[Fort Leavenworth, Kansas]], [[Atchison, Kansas]], [[St. Joseph, Missouri]], and [[Omaha, Nebraska]].\n\nThe Oregon Trail's nominal termination point was [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]], at the time the proposed capital of the [[Oregon Territory]]. However, many settlers branched off or stopped short of this goal and settled at convenient or promising locations along the trail. Commerce with pioneers going further west helped establish these early settlements and launched local economies critical to their prosperity.\n\nAt dangerous or difficult river crossings, ferries or toll bridges were set up and bad places on the trail were either repaired or bypassed. Several toll roads were constructed. Gradually the trail became easier with the average trip (as recorded in numerous diaries) dropping from about 160 days in 1849 to 140 days 10 years later.\n\nNumerous other trails followed the Oregon Trail for much of its length, including the [[Mormon Trail]] from [[Illinois]] to [[Utah]]; the [[California Trail]] to the gold fields of [[California]]; and the [[Bozeman Trail]] to [[Montana]]. Because it was more a network of trails than a single trail there were numerous variations, with other trails eventually established on both sides of the [[Platte River|Platte]], [[North Platte River|North Platte]], [[Snake River|Snake]], and [[Columbia River|Columbia]] rivers. With literally thousands of people and thousands of livestock traveling in a fairly small time slot the travelers had to spread out to find clean water, wood, good campsites, and grass. The dust kicked up by the many travelers was a constant complaint, and where the terrain would allow it there may be between 20 and 50 wagons traveling abreast.\n\nRemnants of the trail in Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, Idaho, and Oregon have been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and the entire trail is a designated [[National Historic Trail]] (listed as the Oregon National Historic Trail).\n\n==Missouri==\nInitially, the main \"jumping off point\" was the common head of the [[Santa Fe Trail]] and Oregon Trail\u2014[[Independence, Missouri]]/[[Kansas City, Kansas]]. Travelers starting in Independence had to ferry across the Missouri River. After following the Santa Fe trail to near present-day [[Topeka, Kansas]], they ferried across the [[Kansas River]] to start the trek across [[Kansas]] and points west. Another busy \"jumping off point\" was [[St. Joseph, Missouri]]\u2014established in 1843.<ref name=\"travel\">{{cite web|url=http://north-america.traveltoworld.com/north-america-travel-guide/5317/saint-peters-missouri/|title=Saint Peters: Missouri|accessdate=August 30, 2007|publisher=North America Travel Guide|author=North America Travel Guide|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006123625/http://north-america.traveltoworld.com/north-america-travel-guide/5317/saint-peters-missouri/|archive-date=October 6, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In its early days, St. Joseph was a bustling outpost and rough frontier town, serving as one of the last supply points before heading over the Missouri River to the frontier. St. Joseph had good steamboat connections to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and other ports on the combined [[Ohio River|Ohio]], [[Missouri River|Missouri]] and [[Mississippi River]] systems. During the busy season there were several ferry boats and steamboats available to transport travelers to the Kansas shore where they started their travels westward. Before the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] was started in 1865, St. Joseph was the westernmost point in the United States accessible by rail. Other towns used as supply points in Missouri included Old Franklin,<ref>Old Franklin Missouri [http://www.santafetrailresearch.com/spacepix/franklin-mo.html] accessed 13 January 2010</ref> [[Arrow Rock, Missouri|Arrow Rock]], and [[Fort Osage]].\n\n==Iowa==\nIn 1803 President [[Thomas Jefferson]] purchased from [[France]] the [[Louisiana Purchase]] for fifteen million dollars (equivalent to about $230 million today) which included all the land drained by the Missouri River and roughly doubled the size of U.S. territory. The future states of [[Iowa]] and [[Missouri]], located west of the [[Mississippi River]] and east of the Missouri River, were part of this purchase. The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] stopped several times in the future state of Iowa on their 1805-1806 expedition to the west coast. A disputed 1804 treaty between [[Quashquame]] and [[William Henry Harrison]] (future ninth President of the U.S.) that surrendered much of the future state of [[Illinois]] to the U.S. enraged many [[Sauk people|Sauk]] (Sac) Indians and led to the 1832 [[Black Hawk War]]. As punishment for the uprising, and as part of a larger settlement strategy, treaties were subsequently designed to remove all Indians from Iowa Territory. Some settlers started drifting into Iowa in 1833. President [[Martin Van Buren]] on July 4, 1838, signed laws establishing the Territory of Iowa. Iowa was located opposite the junction of the [[Platte River|Platte]] and Missouri rivers and was used by some of the [[Rocky Mountain Rendezvous|Fur trapper rendezvous]] traders as a starting point for their supply expeditions. In 1846 the [[Mormons]], expelled from [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], traversed Iowa (on part of the [[Mormon Trail]]) and settled temporarily in significant numbers on the Missouri River in Iowa and the future state of [[Nebraska]] at their [[Winter Quarters (North Omaha, Nebraska)|Winter Quarters]] near the future city of [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. (See: Missouri River settlements (1846\u20131854)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://winterquarters.byu.edu/pages/settlements.htm |title=Winter Quarters Project |publisher=Winterquarters.byu.edu |accessdate=2011-03-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719155702/http://winterquarters.byu.edu/pages/settlements.htm |archivedate=2011-07-19 }}</ref>) The Mormons established about 50 temporary towns, including the town of Kanesville (renamed [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]] in 1852) on the east bank of the Missouri River opposite the mouth of the Platte. For those travelers to Oregon, California, and Utah who were bringing their teams to the Platte River junction, Kanesville and other towns become major \"jumping off places\" and supply points. In 1847 the Mormons established three ferries across the Missouri River, and others established even more ferries for the spring start on the trail. In the 1850 census there were about 8,000 mostly Mormons tabulated in the large [[Pottawattamie County, Iowa]] District 21. (The original Pottawattamie County was subsequently made into five counties and parts of several more.)  By 1854 most of the Mormon towns, farms and villages were largely taken over by non-Mormons as they abandoned them or sold them for not much and continued their migration to Utah. After 1846 the towns of Council Bluffs, Iowa, [[Omaha, Nebraska]] (est. 1852) and other Missouri River towns became major supply points and \"jumping off places\" for travelers on the [[Mormon Trail|Mormon]], [[California Trail|California]], Oregon and other trails west.\n\n==Kansas==\n[[Image:Ks rivers.png|thumb|Map of principal rivers in Kansas]]\n\nStarting initially in [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]] or [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] in Missouri, the initial trail followed the [[Santa Fe Trail]] into Kansas south of the [[Wakarusa River]]. After crossing [[Mount Oread]] at [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], the trail crossed the [[Kansas River]] by ferry or boats near [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], and crossed the Wakarusa and Vermillion rivers by ferries. After the Vermillion River the trail angles northwest to [[Nebraska]] paralleling the [[Little Blue River (Kansas/Nebraska)|Little Blue River]] until reaching the south side of the [[Platte River]]. Travel by wagon over the gently rolling Kansas countryside was usually unimpeded except where streams had cut steep banks. There a passage could be made with a lot of shovel work to cut down the banks or the travelers could find an already established crossing.\n\n==Nebraska==\n[[File:Chimney Rock NE.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chimney Rock National Historic Site|Chimney Rock, Nebraska]]]]\nThose emigrants on the eastern side of the Missouri River in [[Missouri]] or [[Iowa]] used ferries and steamboats (fitted out for ferry duty) to cross into towns in [[Nebraska]]. Several towns in Nebraska were used as \"jumping off places\" with [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]] eventually becoming a favorite after about 1855. [[Fort Kearny]] (est. 1848) is about {{convert|200|mi|km}} from the Missouri River, and the trail and its many offshoots nearly all converged close to Fort Kearny as they followed the [[Platte River]] west. The army-maintained fort was the first chance on the trail to buy emergency supplies, do repairs, get medical aid, or mail a letter. Those on the north side of the Platte could usually wade the shallow river if they needed to visit the fort.\n\n[[Image:Platterivermap.png|275px|right|thumbnail|Map showing the Platte River watershed, including the North Platte and South Platte tributaries]]\n\nThe Platte River and the [[North Platte River]] in the future states of Nebraska and Wyoming typically had many channels and islands and were too shallow, crooked, muddy and unpredictable for travel even by canoe. The Platte as it pursued its braided paths to the Missouri River was \"too thin to plow and too thick to drink\". While unusable for transport, the Platte River and North Platte River valleys provided an easily passable wagon corridor going almost due west with access to water, grass, buffalo, and [[cow dung|buffalo chip]]s for fuel.<ref>Mattes, Merrill J. ''The Great Platte River Road''. Bison Books, 1987. {{ISBN|978-0-8032-8153-0}}</ref> The trails gradually got rougher as it progressed up the North Platte. There were trails on both sides of the muddy rivers. The Platte was about {{convert|1|mi|km}} wide and {{convert|2|to|60|in|cm}} deep. The water was silty and bad tasting but it could be used if no other water was available. Letting it sit in a bucket for an hour or so or stirring in a 1/4 cup of cornmeal allowed most of the silt to settle out. Those traveling south of the Platte crossed the [[South Platte River]] with its muddy and treacherous crossings using one of about three ferries (in dry years it could sometimes be forded without a ferry) before continuing up the North Platte River valley to [[Fort Laramie]] in present-day [[Wyoming]]. After crossing over the South Platte the travelers encountered [[Ash Hollow State Historical Park|Ash Hollow]] with its steep descent down [[Windlass Hill]].\n\nIn the spring in Nebraska and Wyoming the travelers often encountered fierce wind, rain and lightning storms. Until about 1870 travelers encountered hundreds of thousands of [[bison]] migrating through Nebraska on both sides of the Platte River, and most travelers killed several for fresh meat and to build up their supplies of dried [[Jerky (food)|jerky]] for the rest of the journey. The prairie grass in many places was several feet high with only the hat of a traveler on horseback showing as they passed through the prairie grass. In many years the Indians fired much of the dry grass on the prairie every fall so the only trees or bushes available for firewood were on islands in the Platte river. Travelers gathered and ignited dried [[cow dung|buffalo chips]] to cook their meals. These burned fast in a breeze, and it could take two or more bushels of chips to get one meal prepared. Those traveling south of the Platte crossed the [[South Platte]] fork at one of about three ferries (in dry years it could be forded without a ferry) before continuing up the [[North Platte River]] valley into present-day [[Wyoming]] heading to [[Fort Laramie]]. Before 1852 those on the north side of the Platte crossed the North Platte to the south side at Fort Laramie. After 1852 they used Child's Cutoff to stay on the north side to about the present day town of [[Casper, Wyoming|Casper]], Wyoming, where they crossed over to the south side.<ref>Pictures of Oregon Trail in Nebraska [http://www.globalclassroom.org/nebraska.html] Accessed 22 February 2009</ref>\n\nNotable landmarks in Nebraska include [[Courthouse and Jail Rocks]], [[Chimney Rock National Historic Site|Chimney Rock]], [[Scotts Bluff National Monument|Scotts Bluff]], and [[Ash Hollow State Historical Park]].<ref>[http://incolor.inetnebr.com/gnelson/neocta.html Nebraska's branch of Oregon-California trail Association] Accessed 22 February 2009</ref>\n\nToday much of the Oregon Trail follows roughly along [[Interstate 80]] from Wyoming to [[Grand Island, Nebraska|Grand Island]], Nebraska. From there [[U.S. Highway 30]] which follows the Platte River is a better approximate path for those traveling the north side of the Platte. The National Park Service (NPS) gives traveling advice for those who want to follow other branches of the trail.<ref>NPS road guide Oregon Trail Nebraska eastern Wyoming [http://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/upload/NE_ATRIG_Web.pdf] accessed 8 February 2010</ref>\n\n===Cholera on the Platte River===\nBecause of the Platte's brackish water, the preferred camping spots were along one of the many fresh water streams draining into the Platte or the occasional fresh water spring found along the way. These preferred camping spots became sources of [[cholera]] in the epidemic years (1849\u20131855) as many thousands of people used the same camping spots with essentially no sewage facilities or adequate sewage treatment. There are many cases cited where a person would be alive and apparently healthy in the morning and dead by nightfall.\n\nFort Laramie marked the end of most [[cholera]] outbreaks. Spread by cholera bacteria in fecal contaminated water, cholera caused massive diarrhea, leading to dehydration and death. In those days its cause and treatment were unknown, and it was often fatal\u2014up to 30% of infected people died. It is believed that the swifter flowing rivers in Wyoming helped prevent the germs from spreading.<ref>\"Treading the Elephant's Tail: Medical Problems on the Overland Trails\". Overland Journal, Volume 6, Number 1, 1988; Peter D. Olch; Pp. 25\u201331; {{ISBN|978-0-674-00881-6}}</ref>\n\nThe cause of cholera, ingesting the ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' bacterium from contaminated water,<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/cholera/DS00579/DSECTION=causes Causes of Cholera]</ref> and the best treatment for cholera infections were unknown in this era. Literally hundreds of travelers on the combined [[California Trail|California]], Oregon, and [[Mormon Trail]]s succumbed to cholera in the 1849-1855 time period. Most were buried in unmarked graves in Kansas, Nebraska, and Wyoming.\n\n==Colorado==\nA branch of the Oregon Trail crossed the very northeast corner of [[Colorado]] if they followed the [[South Platte River]] to one of its last crossings. This branch of the trail passed through present-day [[Julesburg, Colorado]] before entering Wyoming. Later settlers to much of what became the state of Colorado followed the Platte and South Platte rivers into their settlements there.\n\n==Wyoming==\n{{Main|Emigrant Trail in Wyoming}}\n\nAfter crossing the [[South Platte River]] the Oregon Trail follows the [[North Platte River]] out of Nebraska into Wyoming. [[Fort Laramie National Historic Site|Fort Laramie]], at the junction of the [[Laramie River]] and the North Platte River, was a major stopping point. Fort Laramie was a former fur trading outpost originally named Fort John that was purchased in 1848 by the U.S. Army to protect travelers on the trails.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/archive/fola/chrono.htm Chronological List of Fort Laramie History]</ref> It was the last army outposts till travelers reached the coast.\n\n[[File:IndependenceRock2.jpg|thumb|right|Independence Rock]]After crossing the South Platte the trail continues up the [[North Platte River]], crossing many small swift flowing creeks. As the North Platte veers to the south the trail crosses the North Platte to the [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]] valley which heads almost due west. [[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]] is located on the Sweetwater River. The Sweetwater would have to be crossed up to nine times before the trail crosses over the [[Continental Divide]] at [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]], Wyoming. From South Pass the trail continues southwest crossing [[Big Sandy River (Wyoming)|Big Sandy Creek]] (about {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|1|ft}} deep) before hitting the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]]. Three to five ferries were in use on the Green during peak travel periods. The swift and treacherous Green River, which eventually empties into the [[Colorado River]], was usually at high water in July and August, and it was a dangerous crossing. After crossing the Green the main trail continues on in an approximate southwest direction until it encounters the [[Blacks Fork]] of the Green River and [[Fort Bridger]], Wyoming. From Fort Bridger the [[Mormon Trail]] continued southwest following the upgraded [[Hastings Cutoff]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceviews.com/historical/hastingscutoff.html|title=Hastings Cutoff |publisher=Scienceviews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-19}}</ref> through the [[Wasatch Mountains]]. From Fort Bridger, the main trail, comprising several variants, veered northwest over the Bear River Divide and descended to the [[Bear River (Great Salt Lake)|Bear River]] Valley.<ref>http://www.blm.gov/heritage/adventures/research/StatePages/PDFs/Wyoming/wyoming_5.pdf{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The trail turned north following the Bear River past the terminus of the Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff at Smiths Fork<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wyomingtalesandtrails.com/cokeville.html |title=Lincoln County Photos II-Wyoming Tales and Trails |publisher=Wyomingtalesandtrails.com |date=1952-06-30 |accessdate=2011-03-19}}</ref> and on to the Thomas Fork Valley at the present Wyoming-Idaho border.\n\nOver time, two major heavily used cutoffs were established in Wyoming. The '''Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff''' was established in 1844 and cut about {{convert|70|mi|km}} off the main route. It leaves the main trail about {{convert|10|mi|km}} west of South Pass and heads almost due west crossing Big Sandy Creek and then about {{convert|45|mi|km}} of waterless, very dusty desert before reaching the Green River near the present town of [[La Barge, Wyoming|La Barge]]. Ferries here transferred them across the Green River. From there the Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff trail had to cross a mountain range to connect with the main trail near [[Cokeville, Wyoming]] in the Bear River valley.<ref>[http://wyoshpo.state.wy.us/trailsdemo/sublettegreenwood.htm Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff Map]</ref>\n\nThe '''Lander Road''', formally the Fort Kearney, South Pass, and Honey Lake Wagon Road, was established and built by U.S. government contractors in 1858-59.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/additionalestima00unitrich |title=Additional estimate for Fort Kearney, South Pass, and Honey Lake wagon road : letter from the acting Secretary of the Interior, transmitting a communication from Colonel Lander in regard to the Fort Kearney, South Pass and Honey Lake wagon road : United States.

The traffic in later years is undocumented.\n\nThe Lander Road departs the main trail at Burnt Ranch near South Pass, crosses the Continental Divide north of South Pass and reaches the Green River near the present town of [[Big Piney, Wyoming]]. From there the trail followed Big Piney Creek west before passing over the {{convert|8800|ft|m}} Thompson Pass in the [[Wyoming Range]]. It then crosses over the Smith Fork of the Bear River before ascending and crossing another {{convert|8200|ft|m}} pass on the [[Salt River Range]] of mountains and then descending into [[Star Valley]] Wyoming. It exited the mountains near the present Smith Fork road about {{convert|6|mi|km}} south of the town of [[Smoot, Wyoming]]. The road continued almost due north along the present day Wyoming-Idaho western border through Star Valley. To avoid crossing the [[Salt River (Wyoming)|Salt River]] (which drains into the [[Snake River]]) which runs down Star Valley the Lander Road crossed the river when it was small and stayed west of the Salt River. After traveling down the Salt River valley (Star Valley) about {{convert|20|mi|km}} north the road turned almost due west near the present town of [[Auburn, Wyoming]], and entered into the present state of Idaho along Stump Creek. In Idaho it followed the Stump Creek valley northwest till it crossed the [[Caribou Mountains (Idaho)|Caribou Mountains]] and proceeded past the south end of Grays Lake.<ref>Grays Lake [http://www.seidaho.org/grays_lake.html] accessed 8 February 2010</ref>  The trail then proceeded almost due west to meet the main trail at Fort Hall; alternately, a branch trail headed almost due south to meet the main trail near the present town of [[Soda Springs, Idaho|Soda Springs]], Idaho.<ref>[http://wyoshpo.state.wy.us/trailsdemo/landerroad.htm Lander Road Cutoff Map]</ref><ref>\"Emigrant Trails of Southern Idaho\"; Bureau of Land Management & Idaho State Historical Society;1993; pp 117\u2013125 ASIN: B000KE2KTU</ref>\n\nNumerous landmarks are located along the trail in Wyoming including [[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]], [[Ayres Natural Bridge]] and [[Register Cliff]].\n\n==Utah==\nIn 1847, Brigham Young and the [[Mormon Trail|Mormon]] pioneers departed from the Oregon Trail at [[Fort Bridger]] in Wyoming and followed (and much improved) the rough trail originally recommended by [[Lansford Hastings]] to the [[Donner Party]] in 1846 through the [[Wasatch Mountains]] into [[Utah]].<ref>Salt Lake Cutoff [http://www.americanwest.com/trails/pages/mormtrl.htm] accessdate=17 September 2009</ref> After getting into Utah they immediately started setting up irrigated farms and cities\u2014including [[Salt Lake City, Utah]].

This cutoff rejoined the Oregon and California Trails near the [[City of Rocks National Reserve|City of Rocks]] near the Utah-Idaho border and could be used by both California and Oregon bound travelers. Located about half way on both the [[California Trail|California]] and Oregon Trails many thousands of later travelers used Salt Lake City and other Utah cities as an intermediate stop for selling or trading excess goods or tired livestock for fresh livestock, repairs, supplies or fresh vegetables. The Mormons looked on these travelers as a welcome bonanza as setting up new communities from scratch required nearly everything the travelers could afford to part with. The overall distance to California or Oregon was very close to the same whether one \"detoured\" to Salt Lake City or not. For their own use and to encourage California and Oregon bound travelers the Mormons improved the Mormon Trail from Fort Bridger and the Salt Lake Cutoff trail. To raise much needed money and facilitate travel on the Salt Lake Cutoff they set up several ferries across the [[Weber River|Weber]], [[Bear River (Great Salt Lake)|Bear]] and [[Malad River (Idaho-Utah)|Malad]] rivers which were used mostly by Oregon or California bound travelers.\n\n==Idaho==\nThe main Oregon and California Trail went almost due north from Fort Bridger to the Little Muddy Creek where it passed over the Bear River Mountains to the [[Bear River (Great Salt Lake)|Bear River]] valley which it followed northwest into the Thomas Fork area, where the trail crossed over the present day Wyoming line into Idaho. In the Eastern Sheep Creek Hills in the Thomas Fork valley the emigrants encountered Big Hill. Big Hill was a detour caused by an impassable (then) cut the Bear River made through the mountains and had a tough ascent often requiring doubling up of teams and a very steep and dangerous descent.<ref>Big Hill Idaho (OCTA Idaho) [http://www.idahohistory.net/OTbighill.html] accessed 5 February 2009</ref> (Much later, [[U.S. Highway 30]], using modern explosives and equipment, was built through this cut). In 1852 Eliza Ann McAuley found and with help developed the McAuley Cutoff which bypassed much of the difficult climb and descent of Big Hill.

The soda springs here were a favorite attraction of the pioneers who marveled at the hot carbonated water and chugging \"steamboat\" springs. Many stopped and did their laundry in the hot water as there was usually plenty of good grass and fresh water available.<ref>Soda Springs quotes Idaho State Historical Society [http://www.idahohistory.net/Reference%20Series/0182.pdf] Accessed 25 February 2009</ref> Just west of Soda Springs the Bear River turns southwest as it heads for [[The Great Salt Lake]] and the main trail turns northwest to follow the [[Portneuf River (Idaho)|Portneuf River]] valley to [[Fort Hall]] Idaho. Fort Hall was an old fur trading post located on the [[Snake River]]. It was established in 1832 by [[Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth]] and company and later sold in 1837 to the British [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. At Fort Hall nearly all travelers were given some aid and supplies if they were available and needed. Mosquitoes were constant pests and travelers often mention that their animals were covered with blood from the bites. The route from Fort Bridger to Fort Hall is about {{convert|210|mi|km}}, taking nine to twelve days.\n\nAt Soda Springs was one branch of [[Emigrant Trail in Wyoming#Lander Road|Lander Road]] (established and built with government contractors in 1858) which had gone west from near South Pass, over the Salt River Mountains and down Star Valley before turning west near present-day [[Auburn, Wyoming|Auburn]], Wyoming and entering Idaho. From there it proceeded northwest into Idaho up Stump Creek canyon for about {{convert|10|mi|km|spell=in}}. One branch turned almost 90 degrees and proceeded southwest to Soda Springs. Another branch headed almost due west past Gray\u2019s Lake to rejoin the main trail about {{convert|10|mi|km}} west of Fort Hall.\n\nOn the main trail about {{convert|5|mi|km}} west of Soda Springs '''Hudspeth's Cutoff''' (established 1849 and used mostly by California trail users) took off from the main trail heading almost due west, bypassing Fort Hall. It rejoined the [[California Trail]] at Cassia Creek near the [[City of Rocks National Reserve|City of Rocks]].<ref>Hudspeth cutoff map (OCTA-Idaho) [http://www.idahoocta.org/Idaho_Trail_Sites.html] Accessed 5 February 2009</ref> Hudspeth's Cutoff had five mountain ranges to cross and took about the same amount of time as the main route to Fort Hall but many took it thinking it was shorter. Its main advantage was that it helped spread out the traffic during peak periods, making more grass available.<ref>For an Oregon-California trail map up to the junction in Idaho see ''Oregon National Historic Trail Map NPS [http://www.nps.gov/PWR/customcf/apps/maps/showmap.cfm?alphacode=oreg&parkname=Oregon%20National%20Historic%20Trail].

Near the junction of the [[Raft River]] and the Snake River, the California Trail diverged from the Oregon Trail at another Parting of the Ways junction. Travellers left the Snake River and followed Raft River about {{convert|65|mi|km}} southwest past present day [[Almo, Idaho|Almo]], Idaho. This trail then passed through the [[City of Rocks National Reserve|City of Rocks]] and over Granite Pass where it went southwest along Goose Creek, Little Goose Creek, and Rock Spring Creek. It went about {{convert|95|mi|km}} through [[Thousand Springs Scenic Byway|Thousand Springs Valley]], West Brush Creek, and Willow Creek, before arriving at the [[Humboldt River]] in northeastern Nevada near present-day [[Wells, Nevada|Wells]].<ref>[http://www.elkorose.com/osino/catrailsmap_smaller.jpg Northern Nevada and Utah, Southern Idaho Trail Map] Accessed 9 February 2009</ref> The California Trail proceeded west down the Humboldt before reaching and crossing the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevadas]].\n\nThere are only a few places where the Snake River has not buried itself deep in a canyon. There are few spots where the river slowed down enough to make a crossing possible. Two of these fords were near Fort Hall, where travelers on the Oregon Trail North Side Alternate (established about 1852) and Goodale\u2019s Cutoff (established 1862) crossed the Snake to travel on the north side. Nathaniel Wyeth, the original founder of Fort Hall in 1834, writes in his diary that they found a ford across the Snake River {{convert|4|mi|km}} southwest of where he founded Fort Hall. Another possible crossing was a few miles upstream of Salmon Falls where some intrepid travelers floated their wagons and swam their stock across to join the north side trail. Some lost their wagons and teams over the falls.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.idaho.gov/Reference%20Series/0752.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721042929/http://history.idaho.gov/Reference%20Series/0752.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-21 }}</ref> The trails on the north side joined the trail from Three Island Crossing about {{convert|17|mi|km}} west of Glenns Ferry on the north side of the Snake River.<ref>Oregon Trail North Side Alternate {{cite web |url=http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/id/publications.Par.50091.File.dat/OCTAbooklet.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325011951/http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/id/publications.Par.50091.File.dat/OCTAbooklet.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-25 }} Accessed 25 February 2009</ref> (For map of North Side Alternate see:<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/archive/ciro/hrs/images/fig7.jpg] Accessed 25 February 2009</ref>)\n\n[[Goodale's Cutoff]], established in 1862 on the north side of the Snake River, formed a spur of the Oregon Trail. This cutoff had been used as a pack trail by Indians and fur traders, and emigrant wagons traversed parts of the eastern section as early as 1852. After crossing the Snake River the {{convert|230|mi|km}} cutoff headed north from Fort Hall toward Big Southern Butte following the [[Lost River (Idaho)|Lost River]] part of the way. It passed near the present-day town of [[Arco, Idaho|Arco]], Idaho and wound through the northern part of [[Craters of the Moon National Monument]]. From there it went southwest to [[Camas Prairie]] and ended at [[Fort Boise#Old Fort Boise (1834&ndash;54)|Old Fort Boise]] on the [[Boise River]]. This journey typically took two to three weeks and was noted for its very rough, lava restricted roads and extremely dry climate, which tended to dry the wooden wheels on the wagons, which caused the iron rims to fall off the wheels. Loss of wheels caused many wagons to be abandoned along the route. It rejoined the main trail east of Boise. Goodale's Cutoff is visible at many points along [[U.S. Highway 20]], [[U.S. Highway 26]] and  [[U.S. Highway 93]] between Craters of the Moon National Monument and [[Carey, Idaho|Carey]], Idaho.<ref>Goodale\u2019s Cutoff NPS [http://www.nps.gov/archive/crmo/goodale.htm] Accessed 22 February 2009</ref>\n\n[[Image:Shoshone Falls, Snake River, Idaho ppmsca.10072u.jpg|thumb|right|300px|View across top of Shoshone Falls, Snake River, Idaho ([[Timothy H.

The crossings were doubly treacherous because there were often hidden holes in the river bottom which could overturn the wagon or ensnarl the team, sometimes with fatal consequences. Before ferries were established there were several drownings here nearly every year.<ref>Three Mile Island Crossing Park [http://www.stateparks.com/three_island_crossing.html] Accessed 22 February 2009</ref>\n\nThe north side of the Snake had better water and grass than the south. The trail from Three Island Crossing to [[Fort Boise#Old Fort Boise (1834&ndash;54)|Old Fort Boise]] was about 130 miles long. The usually lush Boise River valley was a welcome relief. The next crossing of the Snake River was near Old Fort Boise. This last crossing of the Snake could be done on bull boats while swimming the stock across. Others would chain a large string of wagons and teams together. The theory was that the front teams, usually oxen, would get out of water first and with good footing help pull the whole string of wagons and teams across. How well this worked in practice is not stated. Often young Indian boys were hired to drive and ride the stock across the river\u2014they knew how to swim, unlike many pioneers. Today's Idaho [[Interstate 84 (west)|Interstate 84]] roughly follows the Oregon Trail till it leaves the Snake River near [[Burley, Idaho|Burley]], Idaho. From there [[Interstate 86 (west)|Interstate 86]] to Pocatello roughly approximates the trail. [[Highway 30]] roughly follows the path of the Oregon Trail from there to [[Montpelier, Idaho|Montpelier]], Idaho.\n\nStarting in about 1848 the South Alternate of Oregon Trail (also called the Snake River Cutoff) was developed as a spur off the main trail. It bypassed the Three Island Crossing and continued traveling down the south side of the Snake River. It rejoined the trail near present-day [[Ontario, Oregon|Ontario]], Oregon. It hugged the southern edge of the Snake River canyon and was a much rougher trail with poorer water and grass, requiring occasional steep descents and ascents with the animals down into the Snake River canyon to get water.

The trail then went to the [[Malheur River]] and then past [[Farewell Bend State Recreation Area|Farewell Bend]] on the Snake River, up the [[Burnt River (Oregon)|Burnt River]] canyon and northwest to the [[La Grande, Oregon|La Grande]] [[Grande Ronde Valley|valley]] before coming to the [[Blue Mountains (Oregon)|Blue Mountains]]. In 1843 settlers cut a wagon road over these mountains making them passable for the first time to wagons. The trail went to the [[Whitman Mission]] near [[Fort Nez Perce]] in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] until 1847 when the Whitmans were killed by Native Americans. At Fort Nez Perce some built rafts or hired boats and started down the Columbia; others continued west in their wagons until they reached [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]]. After 1847 the trail bypassed the closed mission and headed almost due west to present day [[Pendleton, Oregon|Pendleton]], Oregon, crossing the [[Umatilla River]], [[John Day River]], and [[Deschutes River (Oregon)|Deschutes River]] before arriving at The Dalles. [[Interstate 84 (west)|Interstate 84]] in Oregon roughly follows the original Oregon Trail from Idaho to The Dalles.\n\nArriving at the Columbia at The Dalles and stopped by the [[Cascade Mountains]] and [[Mount Hood]], some gave up their wagons or disassembled them and put them on boats or rafts for a trip down the [[Columbia River]]. Once they transited the Cascade's [[Columbia River Gorge]] with its multiple rapids and treacherous winds they would have to make the {{convert|1.6|mi|km}} portage around the [[Cascade Rapids]] before coming out near the [[Willamette River]] where [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]], Oregon was located. The pioneer's livestock could be driven around Mount Hood on the narrow, crooked and rough [[Lolo Pass (Oregon)|Lolo Pass]].\n\nSeveral Oregon Trail branches and route variations led to the [[Willamette Valley]]. The most popular was the [[Barlow Road]], which was carved through the forest around Mount Hood from The Dalles in 1846 as a toll road at $5.00 per wagon and 10 cents per head of livestock. It was rough and steep with poor grass but still cheaper and safer than floating goods, wagons and family down the dangerous Columbia River.\n\nIn Central Oregon there was the [[Santiam Wagon Road]] (established 1861), which roughly parallels Oregon Highway 20 to the Willamette Valley. The [[Applegate Trail]] (established 1846) cutting off the [[California Trail]] from the [[Humboldt River]] in Nevada crossed part of California before cutting north to the south end of the Willamette Valley. Originally [[U.S. Route 99]] (later renamed to [[Oregon Route 99]]) and [[Interstate 5]] through Oregon roughly follow the original Applegate Trail.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|22em}}\n\n[[Category:Oregon Trail]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:Oregontrail 1907.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Map from ''The Vikings team, or the Old Oregon Trail 1852\u20131906'', by [[Ezra Meeker]]]]\n[[Image:South pass marker2.jpg|thumb|right|Oregon Trail pioneer [[Ezra Meeker]] erected this boulder near [[Pacific Creek (Sweetwater County, Wyoming)|Pacific Springs]] on Wyoming's [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] in 1906.<ref>''Ventures and Adventures of Ezra Meeker: Or, Sixty Years of Frontier Life'' by Ezra Meeker.

It was used during the 19th century by [[Great Plains]] pioneers who were seeking fertile land in the West and North.\n\nAs the trail developed it became marked by numerous cutoffs and shortcuts from Missouri to Oregon. The basic route follows river valleys as grass and water were absolutely necessary.\n\nWhile the first few parties organized and departed from Elm Grove, the Oregon Trail's primary starting point was [[Independence, Missouri]], or [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] (Missouri), on the Missouri River. Later, several feeder trails led across [[Kansas]], and some towns became starting points, including [[Weston, Missouri]], [[Fort Leavenworth, Kansas]], [[Atchison, Kansas]], [[St. Joseph, Missouri]], and [[Omaha, Nebraska]].\n\nThe Oregon Trail's nominal termination point was [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]], at the time the proposed capital of the [[Oregon Territory]]. However, many settlers branched off or stopped short of this goal and settled at convenient or promising locations along the trail. Commerce with pioneers going further west helped establish these early settlements and launched local economies critical to their prosperity.\n\nAt dangerous or difficult river crossings, ferries or toll bridges were set up and bad places on the trail were either repaired or bypassed. Several toll roads were constructed. Gradually the trail became easier with the average trip (as recorded in numerous diaries) dropping from about 160 days in 1849 to 140 days 10 years later.\n\nNumerous other trails followed the Oregon Trail for much of its length, including the [[Mormon Trail]] from [[Illinois]] to [[Utah]]; the [[California Trail]] to the gold fields of [[California]]; and the [[Bozeman Trail]] to [[Montana]]. Because it was more a network of trails than a single trail there were numerous variations, with other trails eventually established on both sides of the [[Platte River|Platte]], [[North Platte River|North Platte]], [[Snake River|Snake]], and [[Columbia River|Columbia]] rivers. With literally thousands of people and thousands of livestock traveling in a fairly small time slot the travelers had to spread out to find clean water, wood, good campsites, and grass. The dust kicked up by the many travelers was a constant complaint, and where the terrain would allow it there may be between 20 and 50 wagons traveling abreast.\n\nRemnants of the trail in Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, Idaho, and Oregon have been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and the entire trail is a designated [[National Historic Trail]] (listed as the Oregon National Historic Trail).\n\n==Missouri==\nInitially, the main \"jumping off point\" was the common head of the [[Santa Fe Trail]] and Oregon Trail\u2014[[Independence, Missouri]]/[[Kansas City, Kansas]]. Travelers starting in Independence had to ferry across the Missouri River. After following the Santa Fe trail to near present-day [[Topeka, Kansas]], they ferried across the [[Kansas River]] to start the trek across [[Kansas]] and points west. Another busy \"jumping off point\" was [[St. Joseph, Missouri]]\u2014established in 1843.<ref name=\"travel\">{{cite web|url=http://north-america.traveltoworld.com/north-america-travel-guide/5317/saint-peters-missouri/|title=Saint Peters: Missouri|accessdate=August 30, 2007|publisher=North America Travel Guide|author=North America Travel Guide|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006123625/http://north-america.traveltoworld.com/north-america-travel-guide/5317/saint-peters-missouri/|archive-date=October 6, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In its early days, St. Joseph was a bustling outpost and rough frontier town, serving as one of the last supply points before heading over the Missouri River to the frontier. St. Joseph had good steamboat connections to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and other ports on the combined [[Ohio River|Ohio]], [[Missouri River|Missouri]] and [[Mississippi River]] systems. During the busy season there were several ferry boats and steamboats available to transport travelers to the Kansas shore where they started their travels westward. Before the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] was started in 1865, St. Joseph was the westernmost point in the United States accessible by rail. Other towns used as supply points in Missouri included Old Franklin,<ref>Old Franklin Missouri [http://www.santafetrailresearch.com/spacepix/franklin-mo.html] accessed 13 January 2010</ref> [[Arrow Rock, Missouri|Arrow Rock]], and [[Fort Osage]].\n\n==Iowa==\nIn 1803 President [[Thomas Jefferson]] purchased from [[France]] the [[Louisiana Purchase]] for fifteen million dollars (equivalent to about $230 million today) which included all the land drained by the Missouri River and roughly doubled the size of U.S. territory. The future states of [[Iowa]] and [[Missouri]], located west of the [[Mississippi River]] and east of the Missouri River, were part of this purchase. The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] stopped several times in the future state of Iowa on their 1805-1806 expedition to the west coast. A disputed 1804 treaty between [[Quashquame]] and [[William Henry Harrison]] (future ninth President of the U.S.) that surrendered much of the future state of [[Illinois]] to the U.S. enraged many [[Sauk people|Sauk]] (Sac) Indians and led to the 1832 [[Black Hawk War]]. As punishment for the uprising, and as part of a larger settlement strategy, treaties were subsequently designed to remove all Indians from Iowa Territory. Some settlers started drifting into Iowa in 1833. President [[Martin Van Buren]] on July 4, 1838, signed laws establishing the Territory of Iowa. Iowa was located opposite the junction of the [[Platte River|Platte]] and Missouri rivers and was used by some of the [[Rocky Mountain Rendezvous|Fur trapper rendezvous]] traders as a starting point for their supply expeditions. In 1846 the [[Mormons]], expelled from [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], traversed Iowa (on part of the [[Mormon Trail]]) and settled temporarily in significant numbers on the Missouri River in Iowa and the future state of [[Nebraska]] at their [[Winter Quarters (North Omaha, Nebraska)|Winter Quarters]] near the future city of [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. (See: Missouri River settlements (1846\u20131854)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://winterquarters.byu.edu/pages/settlements.htm |title=Winter Quarters Project |publisher=Winterquarters.byu.edu |accessdate=2011-03-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719155702/http://winterquarters.byu.edu/pages/settlements.htm |archivedate=2011-07-19 }}</ref>) The Mormons established about 50 temporary towns, including the town of Kanesville (renamed [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]] in 1852) on the east bank of the Missouri River opposite the mouth of the Platte. For those travelers to Oregon, California, and Utah who were bringing their teams to the Platte River junction, Kanesville and other towns become major \"jumping off places\" and supply points. In 1847 the Mormons established three ferries across the Missouri River, and others established even more ferries for the spring start on the trail. In the 1850 census there were about 8,000 mostly Mormons tabulated in the large [[Pottawattamie County, Iowa]] District 21. (The original Pottawattamie County was subsequently made into five counties and parts of several more.)  By 1854 most of the Mormon towns, farms and villages were largely taken over by non-Mormons as they abandoned them or sold them for not much and continued their migration to Utah. After 1846 the towns of Council Bluffs, Iowa, [[Omaha, Nebraska]] (est. 1852) and other Missouri River towns became major supply points and \"jumping off places\" for travelers on the [[Mormon Trail|Mormon]], [[California Trail|California]], Oregon and other trails west.\n\n==Kansas==\n[[Image:Ks rivers.png|thumb|Map of principal rivers in Kansas]]\n\nStarting initially in [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]] or [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] in Missouri, the initial trail followed the [[Santa Fe Trail]] into Kansas south of the [[Wakarusa River]]. After crossing [[Mount Oread]] at [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], the trail crossed the [[Kansas River]] by ferry or boats near [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], and crossed the Wakarusa and Vermillion rivers by ferries. After the Vermillion River the trail angles northwest to [[Nebraska]] paralleling the [[Little Blue River (Kansas/Nebraska)|Little Blue River]] until reaching the south side of the [[Platte River]]. Travel by wagon over the gently rolling Kansas countryside was usually unimpeded except where streams had cut steep banks. There a passage could be made with a lot of shovel work to cut down the banks or the travelers could find an already established crossing.\n\n==Nebraska==\n[[File:Chimney Rock NE.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chimney Rock National Historic Site|Chimney Rock, Nebraska]]]]\nThose emigrants on the eastern side of the Missouri River in [[Missouri]] or [[Iowa]] used ferries and steamboats (fitted out for ferry duty) to cross into towns in [[Nebraska]]. Several towns in Nebraska were used as \"jumping off places\" with [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]] eventually becoming a favorite after about 1855. [[Fort Kearny]] (est. 1848) is about {{convert|200|mi|km}} from the Missouri River, and the trail and its many offshoots nearly all converged close to Fort Kearny as they followed the [[Platte River]] west. The army-maintained fort was the first chance on the trail to buy emergency supplies, do repairs, get medical aid, or mail a letter. Those on the north side of the Platte could usually wade the shallow river if they needed to visit the fort.\n\n[[Image:Platterivermap.png|275px|right|thumbnail|Map showing the Platte River watershed, including the North Platte and South Platte tributaries]]\n\nThe Platte River and the [[North Platte River]] in the future states of Nebraska and Wyoming typically had many channels and islands and were too shallow, crooked, muddy and unpredictable for travel even by canoe. The Platte as it pursued its braided paths to the Missouri River was \"too thin to plow and too thick to drink\". While unusable for transport, the Platte River and North Platte River valleys provided an easily passable wagon corridor going almost due west with access to water, grass, buffalo, and [[cow dung|buffalo chip]]s for fuel.<ref>Mattes, Merrill J. ''The Great Platte River Road''. Bison Books, 1987. {{ISBN|978-0-8032-8153-0}}</ref> The trails gradually got rougher as it progressed up the North Platte. There were trails on both sides of the muddy rivers. The Platte was about {{convert|1|mi|km}} wide and {{convert|2|to|60|in|cm}} deep. The water was silty and bad tasting but it could be used if no other water was available. Letting it sit in a bucket for an hour or so or stirring in a 1/4 cup of cornmeal allowed most of the silt to settle out. Those traveling south of the Platte crossed the [[South Platte River]] with its muddy and treacherous crossings using one of about three ferries (in dry years it could sometimes be forded without a ferry) before continuing up the North Platte River valley to [[Fort Laramie]] in present-day [[Wyoming]]. After crossing over the South Platte the travelers encountered [[Ash Hollow State Historical Park|Ash Hollow]] with its steep descent down [[Windlass Hill]].\n\nIn the spring in Nebraska and Wyoming the travelers often encountered fierce wind, rain and lightning storms. Until about 1870 travelers encountered hundreds of thousands of [[bison]] migrating through Nebraska on both sides of the Platte River, and most travelers killed several for fresh meat and to build up their supplies of dried [[Jerky (food)|jerky]] for the rest of the journey. The prairie grass in many places was several feet high with only the hat of a traveler on horseback showing as they passed through the prairie grass. In many years the Indians fired much of the dry grass on the prairie every fall so the only trees or bushes available for firewood were on islands in the Platte river. Travelers gathered and ignited dried [[cow dung|buffalo chips]] to cook their meals. These burned fast in a breeze, and it could take two or more bushels of chips to get one meal prepared. Those traveling south of the Platte crossed the [[South Platte]] fork at one of about three ferries (in dry years it could be forded without a ferry) before continuing up the [[North Platte River]] valley into present-day [[Wyoming]] heading to [[Fort Laramie]]. Before 1852 those on the north side of the Platte crossed the North Platte to the south side at Fort Laramie. After 1852 they used Child's Cutoff to stay on the north side to about the present day town of [[Casper, Wyoming|Casper]], Wyoming, where they crossed over to the south side.<ref>Pictures of Oregon Trail in Nebraska [http://www.globalclassroom.org/nebraska.html] Accessed 22 February 2009</ref>\n\nNotable landmarks in Nebraska include [[Courthouse and Jail Rocks]], [[Chimney Rock National Historic Site|Chimney Rock]], [[Scotts Bluff National Monument|Scotts Bluff]], and [[Ash Hollow State Historical Park]].<ref>[http://incolor.inetnebr.com/gnelson/neocta.html Nebraska's branch of Oregon-California trail Association] Accessed 22 February 2009</ref>\n\nToday much of the Oregon Trail follows roughly along [[Interstate 80]] from Wyoming to [[Grand Island, Nebraska|Grand Island]], Nebraska. From there [[U.S. Highway 30]] which follows the Platte River is a better approximate path for those traveling the north side of the Platte. The National Park Service (NPS) gives traveling advice for those who want to follow other branches of the trail.<ref>NPS road guide Oregon Trail Nebraska eastern Wyoming [http://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/upload/NE_ATRIG_Web.pdf] accessed 8 February 2010</ref>\n\n===Cholera on the Platte River===\nBecause of the Platte's brackish water, the preferred camping spots were along one of the many fresh water streams draining into the Platte or the occasional fresh water spring found along the way. These preferred camping spots became sources of [[cholera]] in the epidemic years (1849\u20131855) as many thousands of people used the same camping spots with essentially no sewage facilities or adequate sewage treatment. There are many cases cited where a person would be alive and apparently healthy in the morning and dead by nightfall.\n\nFort Laramie marked the end of most [[cholera]] outbreaks. Spread by cholera bacteria in fecal contaminated water, cholera caused massive diarrhea, leading to dehydration and death. In those days its cause and treatment were unknown, and it was often fatal\u2014up to 30% of infected people died. It is believed that the swifter flowing rivers in Wyoming helped prevent the germs from spreading.<ref>\"Treading the Elephant's Tail: Medical Problems on the Overland Trails\".

Literally hundreds of travelers on the combined [[California Trail|California]], Oregon, and [[Mormon Trail]]s succumbed to cholera in the 1849-1855 time period. Most were buried in unmarked graves in Kansas, Nebraska, and Wyoming.\n\n==Colorado==\nA branch of the Oregon Trail crossed the very northeast corner of [[Colorado]] if they followed the [[South Platte River]] to one of its last crossings. This branch of the trail passed through present-day [[Julesburg, Colorado]] before entering Wyoming. Later settlers to much of what became the state of Colorado followed the Platte and South Platte rivers into their settlements there.\n\n==Wyoming==\n{{Main|Emigrant Trail in Wyoming}}\n\nAfter crossing the [[South Platte River]] the Oregon Trail follows the [[North Platte River]] out of Nebraska into Wyoming. [[Fort Laramie National Historic Site|Fort Laramie]], at the junction of the [[Laramie River]] and the North Platte River, was a major stopping point. Fort Laramie was a former fur trading outpost originally named Fort John that was purchased in 1848 by the U.S. Army to protect travelers on the trails.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/archive/fola/chrono.htm Chronological List of Fort Laramie History]</ref> It was the last army outposts till travelers reached the coast.\n\n[[File:IndependenceRock2.jpg|thumb|right|Independence Rock]]After crossing the South Platte the trail continues up the [[North Platte River]], crossing many small swift flowing creeks. As the North Platte veers to the south the trail crosses the North Platte to the [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]] valley which heads almost due west. [[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]] is located on the Sweetwater River. The Sweetwater would have to be crossed up to nine times before the trail crosses over the [[Continental Divide]] at [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]], Wyoming. From South Pass the trail continues southwest crossing [[Big Sandy River (Wyoming)|Big Sandy Creek]] (about {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|1|ft}} deep) before hitting the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]]. Three to five ferries were in use on the Green during peak travel periods. The swift and treacherous Green River, which eventually empties into the [[Colorado River]], was usually at high water in July and August, and it was a dangerous crossing. After crossing the Green the main trail continues on in an approximate southwest direction until it encounters the [[Blacks Fork]] of the Green River and [[Fort Bridger]], Wyoming. From Fort Bridger the [[Mormon Trail]] continued southwest following the upgraded [[Hastings Cutoff]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceviews.com/historical/hastingscutoff.html|title=Hastings Cutoff |publisher=Scienceviews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-19}}</ref> through the [[Wasatch Mountains]]. From Fort Bridger, the main trail, comprising several variants, veered northwest over the Bear River Divide and descended to the [[Bear River (Great Salt Lake)|Bear River]] Valley.<ref>http://www.blm.gov/heritage/adventures/research/StatePages/PDFs/Wyoming/wyoming_5.pdf{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The trail turned north following the Bear River past the terminus of the Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff at Smiths Fork<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wyomingtalesandtrails.com/cokeville.html |title=Lincoln County Photos II-Wyoming Tales and Trails |publisher=Wyomingtalesandtrails.com |date=1952-06-30 |accessdate=2011-03-19}}</ref> and on to the Thomas Fork Valley at the present Wyoming-Idaho border.\n\nOver time, two major heavily used cutoffs were established in Wyoming. The '''Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff''' was established in 1844 and cut about {{convert|70|mi|km}} off the main route. It leaves the main trail about {{convert|10|mi|km}} west of South Pass and heads almost due west crossing Big Sandy Creek and then about {{convert|45|mi|km}} of waterless, very dusty desert before reaching the Green River near the present town of [[La Barge, Wyoming|La Barge]]. Ferries here transferred them across the Green River. From there the Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff trail had to cross a mountain range to connect with the main trail near [[Cokeville, Wyoming]] in the Bear River valley.<ref>[http://wyoshpo.state.wy.us/trailsdemo/sublettegreenwood.htm Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff Map]</ref>\n\nThe '''Lander Road''', formally the Fort Kearney, South Pass, and Honey Lake Wagon Road, was established and built by U.S. government contractors in 1858-59.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/additionalestima00unitrich |title=Additional estimate for Fort Kearney, South Pass, and Honey Lake wagon road : letter from the acting Secretary of the Interior, transmitting a communication from Colonel Lander in regard to the Fort Kearney, South Pass and Honey Lake wagon road : United States.

The traffic in later years is undocumented.\n\nThe Lander Road departs the main trail at Burnt Ranch near South Pass, crosses the Continental Divide north of South Pass and reaches the Green River near the present town of [[Big Piney, Wyoming]]. From there the trail followed Big Piney Creek west before passing over the {{convert|8800|ft|m}} Thompson Pass in the [[Wyoming Range]]. It then crosses over the Smith Fork of the Bear River before ascending and crossing another {{convert|8200|ft|m}} pass on the [[Salt River Range]] of mountains and then descending into [[Star Valley]] Wyoming. It exited the mountains near the present Smith Fork road about {{convert|6|mi|km}} south of the town of [[Smoot, Wyoming]]. The road continued almost due north along the present day Wyoming-Idaho western border through Star Valley. To avoid crossing the [[Salt River (Wyoming)|Salt River]] (which drains into the [[Snake River]]) which runs down Star Valley the Lander Road crossed the river when it was small and stayed west of the Salt River. After traveling down the Salt River valley (Star Valley) about {{convert|20|mi|km}} north the road turned almost due west near the present town of [[Auburn, Wyoming]], and entered into the present state of Idaho along Stump Creek. In Idaho it followed the Stump Creek valley northwest till it crossed the [[Caribou Mountains (Idaho)|Caribou Mountains]] and proceeded past the south end of Grays Lake.<ref>Grays Lake [http://www.seidaho.org/grays_lake.html] accessed 8 February 2010</ref>  The trail then proceeded almost due west to meet the main trail at Fort Hall; alternately, a branch trail headed almost due south to meet the main trail near the present town of [[Soda Springs, Idaho|Soda Springs]], Idaho.<ref>[http://wyoshpo.state.wy.us/trailsdemo/landerroad.htm Lander Road Cutoff Map]</ref><ref>\"Emigrant Trails of Southern Idaho\"; Bureau of Land Management & Idaho State Historical Society;1993; pp 117\u2013125 ASIN: B000KE2KTU</ref>\n\nNumerous landmarks are located along the trail in Wyoming including [[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]], [[Ayres Natural Bridge]] and [[Register Cliff]].\n\n==Utah==\nIn 1847, Brigham Young and the [[Mormon Trail|Mormon]] pioneers departed from the Oregon Trail at [[Fort Bridger]] in Wyoming and followed (and much improved) the rough trail originally recommended by [[Lansford Hastings]] to the [[Donner Party]] in 1846 through the [[Wasatch Mountains]] into [[Utah]].<ref>Salt Lake Cutoff [http://www.americanwest.com/trails/pages/mormtrl.htm] accessdate=17 September 2009</ref> After getting into Utah they immediately started setting up irrigated farms and cities\u2014including [[Salt Lake City, Utah]].

This cutoff rejoined the Oregon and California Trails near the [[City of Rocks National Reserve|City of Rocks]] near the Utah-Idaho border and could be used by both California and Oregon bound travelers. Located about half way on both the [[California Trail|California]] and Oregon Trails many thousands of later travelers used Salt Lake City and other Utah cities as an intermediate stop for selling or trading excess goods or tired livestock for fresh livestock, repairs, supplies or fresh vegetables. The Mormons looked on these travelers as a welcome bonanza as setting up new communities from scratch required nearly everything the travelers could afford to part with. The overall distance to California or Oregon was very close to the same whether one \"detoured\" to Salt Lake City or not. For their own use and to encourage California and Oregon bound travelers the Mormons improved the Mormon Trail from Fort Bridger and the Salt Lake Cutoff trail. To raise much needed money and facilitate travel on the Salt Lake Cutoff they set up several ferries across the [[Weber River|Weber]], [[Bear River (Great Salt Lake)|Bear]] and [[Malad River (Idaho-Utah)|Malad]] rivers which were used mostly by Oregon or California bound travelers.\n\n==Idaho==\nThe main Oregon and California Trail went almost due north from Fort Bridger to the Little Muddy Creek where it passed over the Bear River Mountains to the [[Bear River (Great Salt Lake)|Bear River]] valley which it followed northwest into the Thomas Fork area, where the trail crossed over the present day Wyoming line into Idaho. In the Eastern Sheep Creek Hills in the Thomas Fork valley the emigrants encountered Big Hill. Big Hill was a detour caused by an impassable (then) cut the Bear River made through the mountains and had a tough ascent often requiring doubling up of teams and a very steep and dangerous descent.<ref>Big Hill Idaho (OCTA Idaho) [http://www.idahohistory.net/OTbighill.html] accessed 5 February 2009</ref> (Much later, [[U.S. Highway 30]], using modern explosives and equipment, was built through this cut). In 1852 Eliza Ann McAuley found and with help developed the McAuley Cutoff which bypassed much of the difficult climb and descent of Big Hill. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} on they passed present day [[Montpelier, Idaho|Montpelier]], Idaho which is now the site of The National Oregon-California Trail Center.<ref>The National Oregon-California Trail Center [http://www.oregontrailcenter.org/] Accessed 25 February 2009</ref> The trail follows the Bear River northwest to present day [[Soda Springs, Idaho]]. The soda springs here were a favorite attraction of the pioneers who marveled at the hot carbonated water and chugging \"steamboat\" springs. Many stopped and did their laundry in the hot water as there was usually plenty of good grass and fresh water available.<ref>Soda Springs quotes Idaho State Historical Society [http://www.idahohistory.net/Reference%20Series/0182.pdf] Accessed 25 February 2009</ref> Just west of Soda Springs the Bear River turns southwest as it heads for [[The Great Salt Lake]] and the main trail turns northwest to follow the [[Portneuf River (Idaho)|Portneuf River]] valley to [[Fort Hall]] Idaho. Fort Hall was an old fur trading post located on the [[Snake River]]. It was established in 1832 by [[Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth]] and company and later sold in 1837 to the British [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. At Fort Hall nearly all travelers were given some aid and supplies if they were available and needed. Mosquitoes were constant pests and travelers often mention that their animals were covered with blood from the bites. The route from Fort Bridger to Fort Hall is about {{convert|210|mi|km}}, taking nine to twelve days.\n\nAt Soda Springs was one branch of [[Emigrant Trail in Wyoming#Lander Road|Lander Road]] (established and built with government contractors in 1858) which had gone west from near South Pass, over the Salt River Mountains and down Star Valley before turning west near present-day [[Auburn, Wyoming|Auburn]], Wyoming and entering Idaho. From there it proceeded northwest into Idaho up Stump Creek canyon for about {{convert|10|mi|km|spell=in}}. One branch turned almost 90 degrees and proceeded southwest to Soda Springs. Another branch headed almost due west past Gray\u2019s Lake to rejoin the main trail about {{convert|10|mi|km}} west of Fort Hall.\n\nOn the main trail about {{convert|5|mi|km}} west of Soda Springs '''Hudspeth's Cutoff''' (established 1849 and used mostly by California trail users) took off from the main trail heading almost due west, bypassing Fort Hall. It rejoined the [[California Trail]] at Cassia Creek near the [[City of Rocks National Reserve|City of Rocks]].<ref>Hudspeth cutoff map (OCTA-Idaho) [http://www.idahoocta.org/Idaho_Trail_Sites.html] Accessed 5 February 2009</ref> Hudspeth's Cutoff had five mountain ranges to cross and took about the same amount of time as the main route to Fort Hall but many took it thinking it was shorter. Its main advantage was that it helped spread out the traffic during peak periods, making more grass available.<ref>For an Oregon-California trail map up to the junction in Idaho see ''Oregon National Historic Trail Map NPS [http://www.nps.gov/PWR/customcf/apps/maps/showmap.cfm?alphacode=oreg&parkname=Oregon%20National%20Historic%20Trail].

Near the junction of the [[Raft River]] and the Snake River, the California Trail diverged from the Oregon Trail at another Parting of the Ways junction. Travellers left the Snake River and followed Raft River about {{convert|65|mi|km}} southwest past present day [[Almo, Idaho|Almo]], Idaho. This trail then passed through the [[City of Rocks National Reserve|City of Rocks]] and over Granite Pass where it went southwest along Goose Creek, Little Goose Creek, and Rock Spring Creek. It went about {{convert|95|mi|km}} through [[Thousand Springs Scenic Byway|Thousand Springs Valley]], West Brush Creek, and Willow Creek, before arriving at the [[Humboldt River]] in northeastern Nevada near present-day [[Wells, Nevada|Wells]].<ref>[http://www.elkorose.com/osino/catrailsmap_smaller.jpg Northern Nevada and Utah, Southern Idaho Trail Map] Accessed 9 February 2009</ref> The California Trail proceeded west down the Humboldt before reaching and crossing the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevadas]].\n\nThere are only a few places where the Snake River has not buried itself deep in a canyon. There are few spots where the river slowed down enough to make a crossing possible. Two of these fords were near Fort Hall, where travelers on the Oregon Trail North Side Alternate (established about 1852) and Goodale\u2019s Cutoff (established 1862) crossed the Snake to travel on the north side. Nathaniel Wyeth, the original founder of Fort Hall in 1834, writes in his diary that they found a ford across the Snake River {{convert|4|mi|km}} southwest of where he founded Fort Hall. Another possible crossing was a few miles upstream of Salmon Falls where some intrepid travelers floated their wagons and swam their stock across to join the north side trail.

This cutoff had been used as a pack trail by Indians and fur traders, and emigrant wagons traversed parts of the eastern section as early as 1852. After crossing the Snake River the {{convert|230|mi|km}} cutoff headed north from Fort Hall toward Big Southern Butte following the [[Lost River (Idaho)|Lost River]] part of the way. It passed near the present-day town of [[Arco, Idaho|Arco]], Idaho and wound through the northern part of [[Craters of the Moon National Monument]]. From there it went southwest to [[Camas Prairie]] and ended at [[Fort Boise#Old Fort Boise (1834&ndash;54)|Old Fort Boise]] on the [[Boise River]]. This journey typically took two to three weeks and was noted for its very rough, lava restricted roads and extremely dry climate, which tended to dry the wooden wheels on the wagons, which caused the iron rims to fall off the wheels. Loss of wheels caused many wagons to be abandoned along the route. It rejoined the main trail east of Boise.

The crossings were doubly treacherous because there were often hidden holes in the river bottom which could overturn the wagon or ensnarl the team, sometimes with fatal consequences. Before ferries were established there were several drownings here nearly every year.<ref>Three Mile Island Crossing Park [http://www.stateparks.com/three_island_crossing.html] Accessed 22 February 2009</ref>\n\nThe north side of the Snake had better water and grass than the south. The trail from Three Island Crossing to [[Fort Boise#Old Fort Boise (1834&ndash;54)|Old Fort Boise]] was about 130 miles long. The usually lush Boise River valley was a welcome relief. The next crossing of the Snake River was near Old Fort Boise. This last crossing of the Snake could be done on bull boats while swimming the stock across. Others would chain a large string of wagons and teams together. The theory was that the front teams, usually oxen, would get out of water first and with good footing help pull the whole string of wagons and teams across. How well this worked in practice is not stated. Often young Indian boys were hired to drive and ride the stock across the river\u2014they knew how to swim, unlike many pioneers. Today's Idaho [[Interstate 84 (west)|Interstate 84]] roughly follows the Oregon Trail till it leaves the Snake River near [[Burley, Idaho|Burley]], Idaho. From there [[Interstate 86 (west)|Interstate 86]] to Pocatello roughly approximates the trail. [[Highway 30]] roughly follows the path of the Oregon Trail from there to [[Montpelier, Idaho|Montpelier]], Idaho.\n\nStarting in about 1848 the South Alternate of Oregon Trail (also called the Snake River Cutoff) was developed as a spur off the main trail. It bypassed the Three Island Crossing and continued traveling down the south side of the Snake River. It rejoined the trail near present-day [[Ontario, Oregon|Ontario]], Oregon. It hugged the southern edge of the Snake River canyon and was a much rougher trail with poorer water and grass, requiring occasional steep descents and ascents with the animals down into the Snake River canyon to get water. Travellers on this route avoided two dangerous crossings of the Snake River.<ref>National Trail Map [http://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/programs/trails/natltrails.pdf] accessed 22 February 2009</ref> Today's Idaho State Route 78 roughly follows the path of the South Alternate route of the Oregon Trail.\n\nIn 1869 the Central Pacific established [[Kelton, Utah|Kelton]], Utah as a railhead and the terminus of the western mail was moved from Salt Lake City. The Kelton Road became important as a communication and transportation road to the Boise Basin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idahohistory.net/Reference%20Series/0074.pdf |title=IdahoHistory.net |publisher=IdahoHistory.net |date=2010-07-07 |accessdate=2011-03-19}}</ref>\n\n==Oregon==\nOnce across the [[Snake River]] ford near [[Fort Boise#Old Fort Boise (1834&ndash;54)|Old Fort Boise]] the weary travelers traveled across what would become the state of [[Oregon]]. The trail then went to the [[Malheur River]] and then past [[Farewell Bend State Recreation Area|Farewell Bend]] on the Snake River, up the [[Burnt River (Oregon)|Burnt River]] canyon and northwest to the [[La Grande, Oregon|La Grande]] [[Grande Ronde Valley|valley]] before coming to the [[Blue Mountains (Oregon)|Blue Mountains]]. In 1843 settlers cut a wagon road over these mountains making them passable for the first time to wagons. The trail went to the [[Whitman Mission]] near [[Fort Nez Perce]] in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] until 1847 when the Whitmans were killed by Native Americans. At Fort Nez Perce some built rafts or hired boats and started down the Columbia; others continued west in their wagons until they reached [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]]. After 1847 the trail bypassed the closed mission and headed almost due west to present day [[Pendleton, Oregon|Pendleton]], Oregon, crossing the [[Umatilla River]], [[John Day River]], and [[Deschutes River (Oregon)|Deschutes River]] before arriving at The Dalles. [[Interstate 84 (west)|Interstate 84]] in Oregon roughly follows the original Oregon Trail from Idaho to The Dalles.\n\nArriving at the Columbia at The Dalles and stopped by the [[Cascade Mountains]] and [[Mount Hood]], some gave up their wagons or disassembled them and put them on boats or rafts for a trip down the [[Columbia River]]. Once they transited the Cascade's [[Columbia River Gorge]] with its multiple rapids and treacherous winds they would have to make the {{convert|1.6|mi|km}} portage around the [[Cascade Rapids]] before coming out near the [[Willamette River]] where [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]], Oregon was located. The pioneer's livestock could be driven around Mount Hood on the narrow, crooked and rough [[Lolo Pass (Oregon)|Lolo Pass]].\n\nSeveral Oregon Trail branches and route variations led to the [[Willamette Valley]]. The most popular was the [[Barlow Road]], which was carved though the forest around Mount Hood from The Dalles in 1846 as a toll road at $5.00 per wagon and 10 cents per head of livestock. It was rough and steep with poor grass but still cheaper and safer than floating goods, wagons and family down the dangerous Columbia River.\n\nIn Central Oregon there was the [[Santiam Wagon Road]] (established 1861), which roughly parallels Oregon Highway 20 to the Willamette Valley. The [[Applegate Trail]] (established 1846) cutting off the [[California Trail]] from the [[Humboldt River]] in Nevada crossed part of California before cutting north to the south end of the Willamette Valley. Originally [[U.S. Route 99]] (later renamed to [[Oregon Route 99]]) and [[Interstate 5]] through Oregon roughly follow the original Applegate Trail.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|22em}}\n\n[[Category:Oregon Trail]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo: though\u2192through", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_the_Oregon_Trail"}

The amount of warmed hydrogen was too great to burn with the oxygen, so most was to be expelled, giving useful thrust, but greatly reducing the potential efficiency.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nInstead, as part of the [[HOTOL]] project, the liquid air cycle engine (LACE) based [[RB545]] engine was developed with more efficient cycle.

The SABRE engine \"relies on a heat exchanger capable of cooling incoming air to {{convert|-150|C}}, to provide oxygen for mixing with hydrogen and provide jet thrust during atmospheric flight before switching to tanked liquid oxygen when in space.\"\n\nIn air-breathing mode, air enters the engine through an inlet. A bypass system directs some of the air through a precooler into a compressor, which injects it into a combustion chamber where it is burnt with fuel, the exhaust products are accelerated through nozzles to provide thrust. The remainder of the intake air continues through the bypass system to a ring of flame holders which act as a ramjet for part of the air breathing flight regime. A helium loop is used to transfer the heat from the precooler to the fuel and drive the engine pumps and compressors.\n\n===Inlet===\n\nAt the front of the engine, the concept designs propose a simple translating axisymmetric [[Inlet cone|shock cone inlet]] which compresses and slows the air (relative to the engine) to subsonic speeds using two shock reflections. Accelerating the air to the speed of the engine incurs [[ram drag]]. As a result of the shocks, compression, and acceleration the intake air is heated, reaching around {{convert|1000|C|F}} at Mach{{nbsp}}5.5.\n\n[[Bayern-Chemie]], through ESA, have undertaken work to refine and test the intake and bypass systems<ref name=BayernChemieSabreDevelopment>{{Cite web|url=https://bayern-chemie.com/bayern-chemie-concludes-agreement-with-european-space-agency-on-the-further-development-of-sabre-engine/|title=BAYERN-CHEMIE concludes agreement with European Space Agency on the further development of SABRE engine}}</ref>\n\n===Precooler===\n\nAs the air enters the engine at [[supersonic]] or [[hypersonic]] speeds, it becomes hotter than the engine can withstand due to compression effects.<ref name=precooling/> [[Jet engines]], which have the same problem but to a lesser degree, solve it by using heavy [[copper]] or [[nickel]]-based materials, by reducing the engine's [[Overall pressure ratio|pressure ratio]], and by throttling back the engine at the higher airspeeds to avoid melting. However, for a [[single-stage-to-orbit]] (SSTO) spaceplane, such heavy materials are unusable, and maximum thrust is necessary for orbital insertion at the earliest time to minimise [[gravity drag|gravity losses]]. Instead, using a gaseous [[helium]] coolant loop, SABRE dramatically cools the air from {{cvt|1000|C}} down to {{cvt|\u2212150|C}} in a heat exchanger while avoiding [[liquid air|liquefaction]] of the air or blockage from freezing water vapour.\n\nPrevious versions of precoolers such as HOTOL put the hydrogen fuel directly through the precooler. SABRE inserts a helium cooling loop between the air and the cold fuel to avoid problems with [[hydrogen embrittlement]] in the precooler.\n\nThe dramatic cooling of the air created a potential problem: it is necessary to prevent blocking the precooler from frozen water vapour and other air fractions. In October 2012, the cooling solution was demonstrated for 6 minutes using freezing air.<ref>{{cite web| last=Marks| first=Paul| title=Die Erben der Concorde| url=http://www.new-scientist.de/inhalt/hyperschallflugzeuge-die-erben-der-concorde-a-860705.html| publisher=[[New Scientist]]| access-date=10 December 2012| language=German| date=October 2012| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124100307/http://www.new-scientist.de/inhalt/hyperschallflugzeuge-die-erben-der-concorde-a-860705.html| archive-date=24 November 2012| df=dmy-all}} [https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=de&u=http://www.new-scientist.de/inhalt/hyperschallflugzeuge-die-erben-der-concorde-a-860705.html&prev=/search%3Fq%3D%2522mark%2Bford%2522%2Bestec%2Bsabre%26start%3D10%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26sa%3DN%26tbo%3Dd%26rls%3Dcom.microsoft:en-US:%257Breferrer:source%257D%26biw%3D1200%26bih%3D1805&sa=X&ei=4GHGUJmcIvH44QSckoHoCQ&ved=0CDEQ7gEwADgK In English]</ref> The cooler consists of a fine pipework heat exchanger with 16,800 thin-walled tubes,<ref name=AvWeek7apr2019/> and cools the hot in-rushing atmospheric air down to the required {{cvt|\u2212150|C}} in 0.01{{nbsp}}s.<ref>{{cite news| last=Amos |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20510112 |title=BBC News \u2013 Skylon spaceplane engine concept achieves key milestone |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=28 November 2012 |accessdate=1 July 2013}}</ref> The ice prevention system had been a closely guarded secret, but REL disclosed a [[methanol]]-injecting 3D-printed de-icer in 2015 through patents, as they needed partner companies and could not keep the secret while working closely with outsiders.<ref>Norris, Guy. \"[https://awin.aviationweek.com/ArticlesStory.aspx?id=ae0e5600-45e8-4259-9000-9f9c2d14c448 Reaction Engines Reveals Secret Of Sabre Frost Control Technology]{{dead link|date=September 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}\" ''[[Aviation Week & Space Technology|Aerospace Daily & Defense Report]]'', 8 July 2015, p. 3 [https://awin.aviationweek.com/ArticlesStory.aspx?id=ae0e5600-45e8-4259-9000-9f9c2d14c448 Similar article]{{dead link|date=September 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} <!--paywall: http://aviationweek.com/technology/reaction-engines-reveals-inner-secret-sabre-propulsion-technology --></ref><ref>\"[http://www.engineering.com/3DPrinting/3DPrintingArticles/ArticleID/10407/The-Skylon-Spaceplanes-3D-Printed-Injector.aspx The Skylon Spaceplane's 3D Printed Injector]\"</ref><ref>\"[http://3dprint.com/81151/skylon-spaceplane-3d-printing/ Helping the Skylon Spaceplane Reach Orbit with a 3D Printed Injector Mechanism]\"</ref>\n\nIn September 2017 it was announced United States Defense Advanced Research projects (DARPA) had contracted with Reaction Engines Inc to build a high-temperature airflow test facility at Front Range Airport near Watkins, Colorado.

While the geometry of the conventional bell remains static the [[Atmospheric pressure#Altitude atmospheric pressure variation|atmospheric pressure changes with altitude]] and therefore nozzles designed for high performance in the lower atmosphere lose efficiency as they reach higher altitudes. In traditional rockets this is overcome by using multiple stages designed for the atmospheric pressures they encounter. \n\nThe SABRE engine must operate at both low and high altitude scenarios. To ensure efficiency at all altitudes a sort of moving, [[Expanding nozzle]] is used. First at low altitude, jet powered flight the bell is located rearwards, connected to a toroidal combustion chamber surrounding the central rocket combustion chamber. When SABRE then later transitions into rocket mode, the bell is moved forwards, extending the length of the bell of the inner rocket combustion chamber, creating a much larger, high altitude nozzle for more efficient flight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US20150101337A1/en|title=Nozzle arrangement for an engine}}</ref>\n[[File:SABRE_Air_breathing_nozzle_mode.png|thumb|168x168px|Nozzle in Air Breathing Mode]]\n[[File:SABRE_Rocket_nozzle_mode.png|thumb|186x186px|Nozzle in Rocket mode]]\n\n===Bypass burners===\n\nAvoiding [[Liquid air|liquefaction]] improves the efficiency of the engine since less [[entropy]] is generated and therefore less liquid hydrogen is boiled off. However, simply cooling the air needs more liquid hydrogen than can be burnt in the engine core. The excess is expelled through a series of burners called \"spill duct [[ramjet]] burners\",<ref name=\"user\" /><ref name=\"Reactionengines.co.uk\"/> that are arranged in a ring around the central core. These are fed air that bypasses the precooler. This bypass ramjet system is designed to reduce the negative effects of drag resulting from air that passes into the intakes but is not fed into the main rocket engine, rather than generating thrust. At low speeds the ratio of the volume of air entering the intake to the volume that the compressor can feed to the combustion chamber is at its highest, requiring the bypassed air to be accelerated to maintain efficiency at these low speeds. This distinguishes the system from a [[Air turborocket#Types|turboramjet]] where a turbine-cycle's exhaust is used to increase air-flow for the ramjet to become efficient enough to take over the role of primary propulsion.<ref>{{cite web | title=Travelling at the edge of space: Reaction Engines and Skylon in the next 20 years | url=http://ewds.strath.ac.uk/space/OnDemandSeminar/tabid/4560/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/288/Travelling-at-the-edge-of-space--10-March-2010.aspx | publisher=[[University of Strathclyde]] | access-date=9 August 2010 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310093203/http://ewds.strath.ac.uk/space/OnDemandSeminar/tabid/4560/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/288/Travelling-at-the-edge-of-space--10-March-2010.aspx | archive-date=10 March 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n[[File:SABRE ENGINE.jpg|thumb|The latest SABRE engine's design.]]\nTests were carried out in 2008 by Airbourne Engineering Ltd on an [[expansion deflection nozzle]] called STERN to provide the data needed to develop an accurate engineering model to overcome the problem of non-dynamic exhaust expansion.

In this fashion the jets are able to operate to a much higher altitude than would normally be possible.\n\nAt Mach{{nbsp}}5.5 the air-breathing system becomes inefficient and is powered down, replaced by the on-board stored oxygen which allows the engine to accelerate to orbital velocities (around Mach{{nbsp}}25).<ref name=\"how\" />\n\n==Performance==\n\nThe designed [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] of SABRE is fourteen compared to about five for conventional jet engines, and two for [[scramjet]]s.<ref name=\"compare\" /> This high performance is a combination of the denser, cooled air, requiring less compression, and, more importantly, the low air temperatures permitting lighter alloys to be used in much of the engine. Overall performance is much better than the [[RB545]] engine or scramjets.\n\nFuel efficiency (known as [[specific impulse]] in rocket engines) peaks at about 3500&nbsp;[[Specific impulse#Units|seconds]] within the atmosphere.<ref name=\"user\" /> Typical all-rocket systems peak around 450 seconds and even \"typical\" [[nuclear thermal rocket]]s at about 900&nbsp;seconds.\n\nThe combination of high fuel efficiency and low-mass engines permits a SSTO approach, with air-breathing to Mach{{nbsp}}5.14+ at {{convert|28.5|km|feet|abbr=on}} altitude, and with the vehicle reaching orbit with more payload mass per take-off mass than just about any non-[[Nuclear pulse propulsion|nuclear]] launch vehicle ever proposed.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe precooler adds mass and complexity to the system and is the most aggressive and difficult part of the design, but the mass of this heat exchanger is an order of magnitude lower than has been achieved previously. The experimental device achieved heat exchange of almost 1&nbsp;GW/m<sup>3</sup>. The losses from carrying the added weight of systems shut down during the closed cycle mode (namely the precooler and turbo-compressor) as well as the added weight of Skylon's wings are offset by the gains in overall efficiency and the proposed flight plan. Conventional launch vehicles such as the [[Space Shuttle]] spend about one-minute climbing almost vertically at relatively low speeds; this is inefficient but optimal for pure-rocket vehicles. In contrast, the SABRE engine permits a much slower, shallower climb (thirteen minutes to reach the 28.5&nbsp;km transition altitude), while breathing air and using its wings to support the vehicle. This trades gravity drag and an increase in vehicle weight for a reduction in propellant mass and a gain from aerodynamic lift increasing [[payload fraction]] to the level at which SSTO becomes possible.\n\nA hybrid jet engine like SABRE needs only reach low [[hypersonic]] speeds inside the [[Stratosphere|lower atmosphere]] before engaging its closed cycle mode, whilst climbing, to build speed. Unlike [[ramjet]] or [[scramjet]] engines, the design is able to provide high thrust from zero speed up to Mach{{nbsp}}5.4,<ref name=\"SABRE_page\"/> with excellent thrust over the entire flight, from the ground to very high altitude, with high efficiency throughout. In addition, this static thrust capability means the engine can be realistically tested on the ground, which drastically cuts testing costs.<ref name=\"compare\" />\n\nIn 2012, REL expected test

The amount of warmed hydrogen was too great to burn with the oxygen, so most was to be expelled, giving useful thrust, but greatly reducing the potential efficiency.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nInstead, as part of the [[HOTOL]] project, the liquid air cycle engine (LACE) based [[RB545]] engine was developed with more efficient cycle.

The SABRE engine \"relies on a heat exchanger capable of cooling incoming air to {{convert|-150|C}}, to provide oxygen for mixing with hydrogen and provide jet thrust during atmospheric flight before switching to tanked liquid oxygen when in space.\"\n\nIn air-breathing mode, air enters the engine through an inlet. A bypass system directs some of the air through a precooler into a compressor, which injects it into a combustion chamber where it is burnt with fuel, the exhaust products are accelerated through nozzles to provide thrust. The remainder of the intake air continues through the bypass system to a ring of flame holders which act as a ramjet for part of the air breathing flight regime. A helium loop is used to transfer the heat from the precooler to the fuel and drive the engine pumps and compressors.\n\n===Inlet===\n\nAt the front of the engine, the concept designs propose a simple translating axisymmetric [[Inlet cone|shock cone inlet]] which compresses and slows the air (relative to the engine) to subsonic speeds using two shock reflections. Accelerating the air to the speed of the engine incurs [[ram drag]]. As a result of the shocks, compression, and acceleration the intake air is heated, reaching around {{convert|1000|C|F}} at Mach{{nbsp}}5.5.\n\n[[Bayern-Chemie]], through ESA, have undertaken work to refine and test the intake and bypass systems<ref name=BayernChemieSabreDevelopment>{{Cite web|url=https://bayern-chemie.com/bayern-chemie-concludes-agreement-with-european-space-agency-on-the-further-development-of-sabre-engine/|title=BAYERN-CHEMIE concludes agreement with European Space Agency on the further development of SABRE engine}}</ref>\n\n===Precooler===\n\nAs the air enters the engine at [[supersonic]] or [[hypersonic]] speeds, it becomes hotter than the engine can withstand due to compression effects.<ref name=precooling/> [[Jet engines]], which have the same problem but to a lesser degree, solve it by using heavy [[copper]] or [[nickel]]-based materials, by reducing the engine's [[Overall pressure ratio|pressure ratio]], and by throttling back the engine at the higher airspeeds to avoid melting. However, for a [[single-stage-to-orbit]] (SSTO) spaceplane, such heavy materials are unusable, and maximum thrust is necessary for orbital insertion at the earliest time to minimise [[gravity drag|gravity losses]]. Instead, using a gaseous [[helium]] coolant loop, SABRE dramatically cools the air from {{cvt|1000|C}} down to {{cvt|\u2212150|C}} in a heat exchanger while avoiding [[liquid air|liquefaction]] of the air or blockage from freezing water vapour.\n\nPrevious versions of precoolers such as HOTOL put the hydrogen fuel directly through the precooler. SABRE inserts a helium cooling loop between the air and the cold fuel to avoid problems with [[hydrogen embrittlement]] in the precooler.\n\nThe dramatic cooling of the air created a potential problem: it is necessary to prevent blocking the precooler from frozen water vapour and other air fractions. In October 2012, the cooling solution was demonstrated for 6 minutes using freezing air.<ref>{{cite web| last=Marks| first=Paul| title=Die Erben der Concorde| url=http://www.new-scientist.de/inhalt/hyperschallflugzeuge-die-erben-der-concorde-a-860705.html| publisher=[[New Scientist]]| access-date=10 December 2012| language=German| date=October 2012| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124100307/http://www.new-scientist.de/inhalt/hyperschallflugzeuge-die-erben-der-concorde-a-860705.html| archive-date=24 November 2012| df=dmy-all}} [https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=de&u=http://www.new-scientist.de/inhalt/hyperschallflugzeuge-die-erben-der-concorde-a-860705.html&prev=/search%3Fq%3D%2522mark%2Bford%2522%2Bestec%2Bsabre%26start%3D10%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26sa%3DN%26tbo%3Dd%26rls%3Dcom.microsoft:en-US:%257Breferrer:source%257D%26biw%3D1200%26bih%3D1805&sa=X&ei=4GHGUJmcIvH44QSckoHoCQ&ved=0CDEQ7gEwADgK In English]</ref> The cooler consists of a fine pipework heat exchanger with 16,800 thin-walled tubes,<ref name=AvWeek7apr2019/> and cools the hot in-rushing atmospheric air down to the required {{cvt|\u2212150|C}} in 0.01{{nbsp}}s.<ref>{{cite news| last=Amos |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20510112 |title=BBC News \u2013 Skylon spaceplane engine concept achieves key milestone |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=28 November 2012 |accessdate=1 July 2013}}</ref> The ice prevention system had been a closely guarded secret, but REL disclosed a [[methanol]]-injecting 3D-printed de-icer in 2015 through patents, as they needed partner companies and could not keep the secret while working closely with outsiders.<ref>Norris, Guy. \"[https://awin.aviationweek.com/ArticlesStory.aspx?id=ae0e5600-45e8-4259-9000-9f9c2d14c448 Reaction Engines Reveals Secret Of Sabre Frost Control Technology]{{dead link|date=September 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}\" ''[[Aviation Week & Space Technology|Aerospace Daily & Defense Report]]'', 8 July 2015, p. 3 [https://awin.aviationweek.com/ArticlesStory.aspx?id=ae0e5600-45e8-4259-9000-9f9c2d14c448 Similar article]{{dead link|date=September 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} <!--paywall: http://aviationweek.com/technology/reaction-engines-reveals-inner-secret-sabre-propulsion-technology --></ref><ref>\"[http://www.engineering.com/3DPrinting/3DPrintingArticles/ArticleID/10407/The-Skylon-Spaceplanes-3D-Printed-Injector.aspx The Skylon Spaceplane's 3D Printed Injector]\"</ref><ref>\"[http://3dprint.com/81151/skylon-spaceplane-3d-printing/ Helping the Skylon Spaceplane Reach Orbit with a 3D Printed Injector Mechanism]\"</ref>\n\nIn September 2017 it was announced United States Defense Advanced Research projects (DARPA) had contracted with Reaction Engines Inc to build a high-temperature airflow test facility at Front Range Airport near Watkins, Colorado.

While the geometry of the conventional bell remains static the [[Atmospheric pressure#Altitude atmospheric pressure variation|atmospheric pressure changes with altitude]] and therefore nozzles designed for high performance in the lower atmosphere lose efficiency as they reach higher altitudes. In traditional rockets this is overcome by using multiple stages designed for the atmospheric pressures they encounter. \n\nThe SABRE engine must operate at both low and high altitude scenarios. To ensure efficiency at all altitudes a sort of moving, [[Expanding nozzle]] is used. First at low altitude, jet powered flight the bell is located rearwards, connected to a toroidal combustion chamber surrounding the central rocket combustion chamber. When SABRE then later transitions into rocket mode, the bell is moved forwards, extending the length of the bell of the inner rocket combustion chamber, creating a much larger, high altitude nozzle for more efficient flight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US20150101337A1/en|title=Nozzle arrangement for an engine}}</ref>\n[[File:SABRE_Air_breathing_nozzle_mode.png|thumb|168x168px|Nozzle in Air Breathing Mode]]\n[[File:SABRE_Rocket_nozzle_mode.png|thumb|186x186px|Nozzle in Rocket mode]]\n\n===Bypass burners===\n\nAvoiding [[Liquid air|liquefaction]] improves the efficiency of the engine since less [[entropy]] is generated and therefore less liquid hydrogen is boiled off. However, simply cooling the air needs more liquid hydrogen than can be burnt in the engine core. The excess is expelled through a series of burners called \"spill duct [[ramjet]] burners\",<ref name=\"user\" /><ref name=\"Reactionengines.co.uk\"/> that are arranged in a ring around the central core. These are fed air that bypasses the precooler. This bypass ramjet system is designed to reduce the negative effects of drag resulting from air that passes into the intakes but is not fed into the main rocket engine, rather than generating thrust. At low speeds the ratio of the volume of air entering the intake to the volume that the compressor can feed to the combustion chamber is at its highest, requiring the bypassed air to be accelerated to maintain efficiency at these low speeds. This distinguishes the system from a [[Air turborocket#Types|turboramjet]] where a turbine-cycle's exhaust is used to increase air-flow for the ramjet to become efficient enough to take over the role of primary propulsion.<ref>{{cite web | title=Travelling at the edge of space: Reaction Engines and Skylon in the next 20 years | url=http://ewds.strath.ac.uk/space/OnDemandSeminar/tabid/4560/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/288/Travelling-at-the-edge-of-space--10-March-2010.aspx | publisher=[[University of Strathclyde]] | access-date=9 August 2010 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310093203/http://ewds.strath.ac.uk/space/OnDemandSeminar/tabid/4560/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/288/Travelling-at-the-edge-of-space--10-March-2010.aspx | archive-date=10 March 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n[[File:SABRE ENGINE.jpg|thumb|The latest SABRE engine's design.]]\nTests were carried out in 2008 by Airbourne Engineering Ltd on an [[expansion deflection nozzle]] called STERN to provide the data needed to develop an accurate engineering model to overcome the problem of non-dynamic exhaust expansion.

In this fashion the jets are able to operate to a much higher altitude than would normally be possible.\n\nAt Mach{{nbsp}}5.5 the air-breathing system becomes inefficient and is powered down, replaced by the on-board stored oxygen which allows the engine to accelerate to orbital velocities (around Mach{{nbsp}}25).<ref name=\"how\" />\n\n==Performance==\n\nThe designed [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] of SABRE is fourteen compared to about five for conventional jet engines, and two for [[scramjet]]s.<ref name=\"compare\" /> This high performance is a combination of the denser, cooled air, requiring less compression, and, more importantly, the low air temperatures permitting lighter alloys to be used in much of the engine. Overall performance is much better than the [[RB545]] engine or scramjets.\n\nFuel efficiency (known as [[specific impulse]] in rocket engines) peaks at about 3500&nbsp;[[Specific impulse#Units|seconds]] within the atmosphere.<ref name=\"user\" /> Typical all-rocket systems peak around 450 seconds and even \"typical\" [[nuclear thermal rocket]]s at about 900&nbsp;seconds.\n\nThe combination of high fuel efficiency and low-mass engines permits a SSTO approach, with air-breathing to Mach{{nbsp}}5.14+ at {{convert|28.5|km|feet|abbr=on}} altitude, and with the vehicle reaching orbit with more payload mass per take-off mass than just about any non-[[Nuclear pulse propulsion|nuclear]] launch vehicle ever proposed.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe precooler adds mass and complexity to the system and is the most aggressive and difficult part of the design, but the mass of this heat exchanger is an order of magnitude lower than has been achieved previously. The experimental device achieved heat exchange of almost 1&nbsp;GW/m<sup>3</sup>. The losses from carrying the added weight of systems shut down during the closed cycle mode (namely the precooler and turbo-compressor) as well as the added weight of Skylon's wings are offset by the gains in overall efficiency and the proposed flight plan. Conventional launch vehicles such as the [[Space Shuttle]] spend about one-minute climbing almost vertically at relatively low speeds; this is inefficient but optimal for pure-rocket vehicles. In contrast, the SABRE engine permits a much slower, shallower climb (thirteen minutes to reach the 28.5&nbsp;km transition altitude), while breathing air and using its wings to support the vehicle. This trades gravity drag and an increase in vehicle weight for a reduction in propellant mass and a gain from aerodynamic lift increasing [[payload fraction]] to the level at which SSTO becomes possible.\n\nA hybrid jet engine like SABRE needs only reach low [[hypersonic]] speeds inside the [[Stratosphere|lower atmosphere]] before engaging its closed cycle mode, whilst climbing, to build speed. Unlike [[ramjet]] or [[scramjet]] engines, the design is able to provide high thrust from zero speed up to Mach{{nbsp}}5.4,<ref name=\"SABRE_page\"/> with excellent thrust over the entire flight, from the ground to very high altitude, with high efficiency throughout. In addition, this static thrust capability means the engine can be realistically tested on the ground, which drastically cuts testing costs.<ref name=\"compare\" />\n\nIn 2012, REL expected test flights by 2020, and operational flights by 2030.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/in-focus-british-engineers-crack-secret-of-reusab-379609/|title=IN FOCUS \u2013 British engineers 'crack secret of reusable spaceplane'|date=29 November 2012|website=FlightGlobal.com|access-date=19 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Resources==\n* {{cite web\n | title=The Skylon Space plane\n | url=http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/tech_docs/JBIS_v57_22-32.pdf\n |  | publisher=[[Reaction Engines Limited]]\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615104534/http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/tech_docs/JBIS_v57_22-32.pdf\n |archivedate=15 June 2011 }}\n* {{cite web\n | title=The Skylon Spaceplane: Progress To Realisation\n | url=http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/tech_docs/The%20SKYLON%20Spaceplane-Progress%20to%20Realisation,%20JBIS,%202008.pdf\n | \n | publisher=[[Reaction Engines Limited]]\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615133300/http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/tech_docs/The%20SKYLON%20Spaceplane-Progress%20to%20Realisation%2C%20JBIS%2C%202008.pdf\n | archive-date=15 June 2011\n | url-status=dead\n | df=dmy-all\n }}\n* {{cite web\n | title=A Comparison of Propulsions Concepts for SSTO Reusable launchers\n | url=http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/tech_docs/JBIS_v56_108-117.pdf\n |  | publisher=[[Reaction Engines Limited]]\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615104428/http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/tech_docs/JBIS_v56_108-117.pdf\n |archivedate=15 June 2011 }}\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Altitude compensating nozzle]]\n* [[Avatar (spacecraft)]] \u2013 India's air-breathing spaceplane\n* [[Liquid-propellant rocket]]\n* [[Precooled jet engine]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|SABRE (rocket engine)}}\n* {{Official website|https://www.reactionengines.co.uk/sabre}}\n* {{cite web | title=This rocket engine could soon put planes in outer space (12 October 2015) | url=https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2015/11/start/rocket-engine-planes-space | publisher=[[Wired UK]]}}\n* {{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/technology/reaction-engines-begins-test-facility-construction |title= Reaction Engines Begins Test Facility Construction |date= 4 May 2017 |author= Tony Osborne |work= Aerospace Daily & Defense Report |publisher= Aviation Week}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srZzRVNj6uI TF1 time lapse \u2013 August 2018]\n\n{{Reaction Engines}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reaction Engines Sabre}}\n[[Category:Rocket engines using hydrogen propellant]]\n[[Category:Rocket engines of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Jet engines]]\n[[Category:Ramjet engines]]\n[[Category:Proposed engines]]\n[[Category:Rocket engines using the staged combustion cycle]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePrecooler:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: fuly \u2192 fully", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SABRE_(rocket_engine)"}

It was launched as a standalone software client in September 2003 as a way for Valve to provide automatic updates for their games, and expanded to include games from third-party publishers. Steam has also expanded into an online web-based and mobile digital storefront. Steam offers [[digital rights management]] (DRM), [[matchmaking]] servers, [[video streaming]], and [[social networking service]]s. It also provides the user with installation and automatic updating of games, and community features such as friends lists and groups, [[cloud storage|cloud saving]], and in-game voice and chat functionality.\n\nThe software provides a freely available [[application programming interface]] (API) called Steamworks, which developers can use to integrate many of Steam's functions into their products, including matchmaking, in-game achievements, [[microtransaction]]s, and support for user-created content through Steam Workshop. Though initially developed for use on [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]]s, versions for [[macOS]] and [[Linux]] were later released. [[Mobile app]]s  were also released for [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and [[Windows Phone]] in the 2010s. The platform also offers a small selection of other content, including design software, hardware, game soundtracks, [[anime]], and [[film]]s.\n\nThe Steam platform is the largest digital distribution platform for [[Personal computer|PC]] gaming, holding around 75% of the market space in 2013.<ref name=\"bloomberg 2013\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-04/valve-lines-up-console-partners-in-challenge-to-microsoft-sony.html |title=Valve Lines Up Console Partners in Challenge to Microsoft, Sony |website=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |first=Cliff |last=Edwards |date=November 4, 2013 |accessdate=November 5, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024081126/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-04/valve-lines-up-console-partners-in-challenge-to-microsoft-sony.html |archivedate=October 24, 2014}}</ref> By 2017, users purchasing games through Steam totaled roughly {{USD}}4.3 billion, representing at least 18% of global PC game sales.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/steam-revenue-2017 |title=With $4.3 billion in sales, 2017 was Steam\u2019s biggest year yet |first=Dustin |last=Bailey |date=March 22, 2018 |accessdate=March 22, 2018 |website=[[PCGamesN]]}}</ref> By 2019, the service had over 34,000 games with over 95 million monthly active users.

Early access also helps to provide funding to the developers to help complete their games.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vg247.com/2013/03/20/steam-page-now-offers-paid-alphas-introversion-says-such-sales-are-way-forward-for-indies/ |title=Steam page now offers paid-Alphas, Introversion says such sales are \"way forward\" for indies |date=March 20, 2013 |accessdate=March 20, 2013 |publisher=[[VG247]] |first=Stephany |last=Nunneley |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324023535/http://www.vg247.com/2013/03/20/steam-page-now-offers-paid-alphas-introversion-says-such-sales-are-way-forward-for-indies/ |archivedate=March 24, 2013}}</ref> The early access approach allowed more developers to publish games onto the Steam service without the need for Valve's direct curation of games, significantly increasing the number of available games on the service.<ref name=\"polygon steam growth\">{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/12/1/13807904/steam-releases-2016-growth |title=Almost two-fifths of Steam\u2019s entire library was released in 2016 |first=Samit |last=Sarkar |date=December 1, 2016 |accessdate=December 1, 2016 |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202165639/http://www.polygon.com/2016/12/1/13807904/steam-releases-2016-growth |archivedate=December 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\nDevelopers are able to request Steam keys of their products to use as they see fit, such as to give away in promotions, to provide to selected users for review, or to give to key resellers for different profitization.

For example, Valve said that a request for 500,000 keys for a game that has significantly negative reviews and 1,000 sales on Steam is unlikely to be granted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/304003/Valve_engineer_comments_on_restrictions_to_highvolume_Steam_key_requests.php |title=Valve engineer comments on restrictions to high-volume Steam key requests |first=Alissa |last=McAloon |date=August 19, 2017 |accessdate=August 19, 2017 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818175002/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/304003/Valve_engineer_comments_on_restrictions_to_highvolume_Steam_key_requests.php |archivedate=August 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Steam Workshop ===\nThe Steam Workshop is a Steam account-based hosting service for videogame user-created content.

Starting in June 2018, Valve has taken actions against games and developers that are \"[[trolling]]\" the system; in September 2018, Valve explicitly defined that trollers on Steam \"aren't actually interested in good faith efforts to make and sell games to you or anyone\" and instead use \"game shaped object\" that could be considered a video game but would not be considered \"good\" by a near-unanimity of users.<ref name=\"jun2018 valve policy\"/><ref name=\"pcgamer sept2018 policy\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/valve-is-changing-the-way-games-with-nudity-violence-and-sexual-content-are-presented-on-steam/ |title=Valve is changing the way games with nudity, violence, and sexual content are presented on Steam |first=Shaun |last=Prescott |date=September 5, 2018 |accessdate=September 5, 2018 |work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref> As an example, Valve's Lombardi stated that the game ''[[Active Shooter]]'', which would have allowed the player to play as either a SWAT team member tasked to take down the shooter at a school shooting incident or as the shooter themselves, was an example of trolling, as he described it was \"designed to do nothing but generate outrage and cause conflict through its existence\".<ref name=\"vb trolling\"/> While ''Active Shooter'' had been removed from Steam prior to Valve issuing this policy statement under the reasoning that the development had abused the Steam service's terms and conditions, Lombardi asserted that they would have removed the game if it had been offered by any other developer.<ref name=\"vb trolling\">{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/06/07/valves-would-still-block-active-shooter/ |title=Valve\u2019s confusing Steam policy is about Flappy Bird, not bigotry |first=Jeff |last=Grubb |date=June 7, 2018 |accessdate=June 7, 2018 |work=[[Venture Beat]]}}</ref> A day after making this new policy, Valve subsequently removed four yet-released games from the service that appeared to also be created to purposely create outrage, including ''[[AIDS]] Simulator'' and ''[[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] Simulator''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-06-08-valve-removes-aids-simulator-other-controversial-games-from-steam-store |title=Valve removes AIDS Simulator, other controversial games from Steam Store |first=Rebekah |last=Valentine |date=June 7, 2018 |accessdate=June 7, 2018 |work=[[GamesIndustry.biz]]}}</ref> Within a month of clarifying its definition of trolling, Valve removed approximately 170 games from Steam.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/over-170-more-games-have-been-removed-from-steam-in-recent-weeks/ |title=Over 170 more games have been removed from Steam in recent weeks |first=Jody |last=Macgregor |date=September 30, 2018 |accessdate=October 1, 2018 |work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to removing bad actors from the service, Valve has also taken steps to reduce the impact of \"fake games\" and their misuse on the service. In May 2017, Valve identified that there were several games on the service with trading card support, where the developer distributed game codes to thousands of bot-operated accounts that would run the game to earn trading cards that they could then sell for profit; these games would also create false positives that make these games appear more popular than they really were and would impact games suggested to legitimate players through their store algorithms, affecting Steam's Discovery algorithms. Subsequent to this patch, games must reach some type of confidence factor based on actual playtime before they can generate trading cards, with players credited for their time played towards receiving trading cards before this metric is met.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/05/valve-takes-aim-at-fake-games-that-exploit-steam-trading-cards/ |title=Steam tries to shut down \"fake\" games that abuse Trading Card system |first=Kyle |last=Orland |date=May 16, 2017 |accessdate=May 16, 2017 |work=[[Ars Technica]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516211317/https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/05/valve-takes-aim-at-fake-games-that-exploit-steam-trading-cards/ |archivedate=May 16, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/298180/In_the_name_of_the_algorithm_Valve_nerfs_Steam_Trading_Cards.php |title=In the name of the algorithm, Valve nerfs Steam Trading Cards |first=Alex |last=Wawro |date=May 16, 2017 |accessdate=May 16, 2017 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519165818/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/298180/In_the_name_of_the_algorithm_Valve_nerfs_Steam_Trading_Cards.php |archivedate=May 19, 2017}}</ref> Valve identified a similar situation in June 2018 with \"fake games\" that offered large numbers of game achievements with little gameplay aspects, which some users would use to artificially raise their global achievement statistics displayed on their profile.

For example, Eek Games' ''House Party'' included scenes of nudity and sexual encounters in its original release, which drew criticism from the [[National Center on Sexual Exploitation]], leading Valve to remove the title from the service. Eek Games were later able to satisfy Valve's standards by including censor bars within the game and allowing the game to be readded to Steam, though offered a patch on their website to remove the bars.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/08/sexually-explicit-game-returns-to-steam-after-adding-censor-bars/ |title=Sexually explicit game returns to Steam after adding \"censor\" bars |first=Kyle |last=Orland |date=August 1, 2017 |accessdate=May 22, 2018 |work=[[Ars Technica]]}}</ref> In May 2018, several developers of anime-stylized games that contained some light nudity, such as ''[[HuniePop]]'', had been told by Valve they had to address the issues of sexual content within their games or face removal from Steam, leading to questions of inconsistent application of Valve's policies. The National Center on Sexual Exploitation took credit for convincing Valve to target these games. However, Valve later rescinded its orders, allowing these games to remain and telling the developers Valve would re-evaluate the games and inform them of any content that would need to be changed or removed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/valve-rolls-back-crackdown-against-sexual-content-on-steam/ |title=Valve rolls back crackdown against sexual content on Steam |first=Andy |last=Chalk |date=May 21, 2018 |accessdate=May 22, 2018 |work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2018, Valve clarified its policy on content, taking a more hands-off approach rather than deem what content is inappropriate, outside of illegal material. Rather than trying to make decisions themselves on what content is appropriate, Valve enhanced its filtering system to allow developers and publishers to indicate and justify the types of mature content (including violence, nudity, and sexual content) in their games.

It was launched as a standalone software client in September 2003 as a way for Valve to provide automatic updates for their games, and expanded to include games from third-party publishers. Steam has also expanded into an online web-based and mobile digital storefront. Steam offers [[digital rights management]] (DRM), [[matchmaking]] servers, [[video streaming]], and [[social networking service]]s. It also provides the user with installation and automatic updating of games, and community features such as friends lists and groups, [[cloud storage|cloud saving]], and in-game voice and chat functionality.\n\nThe software provides a freely available [[application programming interface]] (API) called Steamworks, which developers can use to integrate many of Steam's functions into their products, including matchmaking, in-game achievements, [[microtransaction]]s, and support for user-created content through Steam Workshop. Though initially developed for use on [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]]s, versions for [[macOS]] and [[Linux]] were later released. [[Mobile app]]s  were also released for [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and [[Windows Phone]] in the 2010s. The platform also offers a small selection of other content, including design software, hardware, game soundtracks, [[anime]], and [[film]]s.\n\nThe Steam platform is the largest digital distribution platform for [[Personal computer|PC]] gaming, holding around 75% of the market space in 2013.<ref name=\"bloomberg 2013\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-04/valve-lines-up-console-partners-in-challenge-to-microsoft-sony.html |title=Valve Lines Up Console Partners in Challenge to Microsoft, Sony |website=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |first=Cliff |last=Edwards |date=November 4, 2013 |accessdate=November 5, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024081126/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-04/valve-lines-up-console-partners-in-challenge-to-microsoft-sony.html |archivedate=October 24, 2014}}</ref> By 2017, users purchasing games through Steam totaled roughly {{USD}}4.3 billion, representing at least 18% of global PC game sales.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/steam-revenue-2017 |title=With $4.3 billion in sales, 2017 was Steam\u2019s biggest year yet |first=Dustin |last=Bailey |date=March 22, 2018 |accessdate=March 22, 2018 |website=[[PCGamesN]]}}</ref> By 2019, the service had over 34,000 games with over 95 million monthly active users.

Early access also helps to provide funding to the developers to help complete their games.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vg247.com/2013/03/20/steam-page-now-offers-paid-alphas-introversion-says-such-sales-are-way-forward-for-indies/ |title=Steam page now offers paid-Alphas, Introversion says such sales are \"way forward\" for indies |date=March 20, 2013 |accessdate=March 20, 2013 |publisher=[[VG247]] |first=Stephany |last=Nunneley |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324023535/http://www.vg247.com/2013/03/20/steam-page-now-offers-paid-alphas-introversion-says-such-sales-are-way-forward-for-indies/ |archivedate=March 24, 2013}}</ref> The early access approach allowed more developers to publish games onto the Steam service without the need for Valve's direct curation of games, significantly increasing the number of available games on the service.<ref name=\"polygon steam growth\">{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/12/1/13807904/steam-releases-2016-growth |title=Almost two-fifths of Steam\u2019s entire library was released in 2016 |first=Samit |last=Sarkar |date=December 1, 2016 |accessdate=December 1, 2016 |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202165639/http://www.polygon.com/2016/12/1/13807904/steam-releases-2016-growth |archivedate=December 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\nDevelopers are able to request Steam keys of their products to use as they see fit, such as to give away in promotions, to provide to selected users for review, or to give to key resellers for different profitization.

For example, Valve said that a request for 500,000 keys for a game that has significantly negative reviews and 1,000 sales on Steam is unlikely to be granted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/304003/Valve_engineer_comments_on_restrictions_to_highvolume_Steam_key_requests.php |title=Valve engineer comments on restrictions to high-volume Steam key requests |first=Alissa |last=McAloon |date=August 19, 2017 |accessdate=August 19, 2017 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818175002/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/304003/Valve_engineer_comments_on_restrictions_to_highvolume_Steam_key_requests.php |archivedate=August 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Steam Workshop ===\nThe Steam Workshop is a Steam account-based hosting service for videogame user-created content.

Starting in June 2018, Valve has taken actions against games and developers that are \"[[trolling]]\" the system; in September 2018, Valve explicitly defined that trollers on Steam \"aren't actually interested in good faith efforts to make and sell games to you or anyone\" and instead use \"game shaped object\" that could be considered a video game but would not be considered \"good\" by a near-unanimity of users.<ref name=\"jun2018 valve policy\"/><ref name=\"pcgamer sept2018 policy\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/valve-is-changing-the-way-games-with-nudity-violence-and-sexual-content-are-presented-on-steam/ |title=Valve is changing the way games with nudity, violence, and sexual content are presented on Steam |first=Shaun |last=Prescott |date=September 5, 2018 |accessdate=September 5, 2018 |work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref> As an example, Valve's Lombardi stated that the game ''[[Active Shooter]]'', which would have allowed the player to play as either a SWAT team member tasked to take down the shooter at a school shooting incident or as the shooter themselves, was an example of trolling, as he described it was \"designed to do nothing but generate outrage and cause conflict through its existence\".<ref name=\"vb trolling\"/> While ''Active Shooter'' had been removed from Steam prior to Valve issuing this policy statement under the reasoning that the development had abused the Steam service's terms and conditions, Lombardi asserted that they would have removed the game if it had been offered by any other developer.<ref name=\"vb trolling\">{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/06/07/valves-would-still-block-active-shooter/ |title=Valve\u2019s confusing Steam policy is about Flappy Bird, not bigotry |first=Jeff |last=Grubb |date=June 7, 2018 |accessdate=June 7, 2018 |work=[[Venture Beat]]}}</ref> A day after making this new policy, Valve subsequently removed four yet-released games from the service that appeared to also be created to purposely create outrage, including ''[[AIDS]] Simulator'' and ''[[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] Simulator''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-06-08-valve-removes-aids-simulator-other-controversial-games-from-steam-store |title=Valve removes AIDS Simulator, other controversial games from Steam Store |first=Rebekah |last=Valentine |date=June 7, 2018 |accessdate=June 7, 2018 |work=[[GamesIndustry.biz]]}}</ref> Within a month of clarifying its definition of trolling, Valve removed approximately 170 games from Steam.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/over-170-more-games-have-been-removed-from-steam-in-recent-weeks/ |title=Over 170 more games have been removed from Steam in recent weeks |first=Jody |last=Macgregor |date=September 30, 2018 |accessdate=October 1, 2018 |work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to removing bad actors from the service, Valve has also taken steps to reduce the impact of \"fake games\" and their misuse on the service. In May 2017, Valve identified that there were several games on the service with trading card support, where the developer distributed game codes to thousands of bot-operated accounts that would run the game to earn trading cards that they could then sell for profit; these games would also create false positives that make these games appear more popular than they really were and would impact games suggested to legitimate players through their store algorithms, affecting Steam's Discovery algorithms. Subsequent to this patch, games must reach some type of confidence factor based on actual playtime before they can generate trading cards, with players credited for their time played towards receiving trading cards before this metric is met.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/05/valve-takes-aim-at-fake-games-that-exploit-steam-trading-cards/ |title=Steam tries to shut down \"fake\" games that abuse Trading Card system |first=Kyle |last=Orland |date=May 16, 2017 |accessdate=May 16, 2017 |work=[[Ars Technica]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516211317/https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/05/valve-takes-aim-at-fake-games-that-exploit-steam-trading-cards/ |archivedate=May 16, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/298180/In_the_name_of_the_algorithm_Valve_nerfs_Steam_Trading_Cards.php |title=In the name of the algorithm, Valve nerfs Steam Trading Cards |first=Alex |last=Wawro |date=May 16, 2017 |accessdate=May 16, 2017 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519165818/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/298180/In_the_name_of_the_algorithm_Valve_nerfs_Steam_Trading_Cards.php |archivedate=May 19, 2017}}</ref> Valve identified a similar situation in June 2018 with \"fake games\" that offered large numbers of game achievements with little gameplay aspects, which some users would use to artificially raise their global achievement statistics displayed on their profile.

For example, Eek Games' ''House Party'' included scenes of nudity and sexual encounters in its original release, which drew criticism from the [[National Center on Sexual Exploitation]], leading Valve to remove the title from the service. Eek Games were later able to satisfy Valve's standards by including censor bars within the game and allowing the game to be readded to Steam, though offered a patch on their website to remove the bars.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/08/sexually-explicit-game-returns-to-steam-after-adding-censor-bars/ |title=Sexually explicit game returns to Steam after adding \"censor\" bars |first=Kyle |last=Orland |date=August 1, 2017 |accessdate=May 22, 2018 |work=[[Ars Technica]]}}</ref> In May 2018, several developers of anime-stylized games that contained some light nudity, such as ''[[HuniePop]]'', had been told by Valve they had to address the issues of sexual content within their games or face removal from Steam, leading to questions of inconsistent application of Valve's policies. The National Center on Sexual Exploitation took credit for convincing Valve to target these games. However, Valve later rescinded its orders, allowing these games to remain and telling the developers Valve would re-evaluate the games and inform them of any content that would need to be changed or removed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/valve-rolls-back-crackdown-against-sexual-content-on-steam/ |title=Valve rolls back crackdown against sexual content on Steam |first=Andy |last=Chalk |date=May 21, 2018 |accessdate=May 22, 2018 |work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2018, Valve clarified its policy on content, taking a more hands-off approach rather than deem what content is inappropriate, outside of illegal material. Rather than trying to make decisions themselves on what content is appropriate, Valve enhanced its filtering system to allow developers and publishers to indicate and justify the types of mature content (including violence, nudity, and sexual content) in their games.

His works feature music in many genres, including a cycle of nine symphonies, numerous concertos, concert works, chamber music, choral music and music for brass band and wind band. He wrote extensively for the theatre, with five ballets specially commissioned by the Royal Ballet, as well as two operas and a musical. He also produced scores for more than a hundred films, among these ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' (1957), for which he won an Oscar.\n\n==Early life==\nMalcolm Arnold was born in [[Northampton]], [[Northamptonshire]], England, the youngest of five children from a prosperous Northampton family of shoemakers. Although shoemakers, his family was full of musicians; both of his parents were pianists, and his aunt was a violinist. After seeing [[Louis Armstrong]] play in [[Bournemouth]], he took up the trumpet at the age of 12 and five years later won a scholarship to the [[Royal College of Music]] (R.C.M.).\n\nAt the RCM he studied composition with [[Gordon Jacob]]<ref name=Grove>Grove Concise Dictionary of Music 1988 {{ISBN|0-333-43236-3}}</ref> and the trumpet with Ernest Hall. In 1941 he joined the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]]<ref name=Grove/> (LPO) as second trumpet and became principal trumpet in 1943.\n\nIn 1941 he registered as a [[conscientious objector]], and was initially exempted from military service conditional upon joining the [[National Fire Service]], but in the event he was allowed to continue in the LPO. In 1944, after his brother in the [[Royal Air Force]] had been killed, he volunteered for military service. When the army put him in a military band he shot himself in the foot to get back to civilian life; he remained in touch with the CO movement, giving a trumpet recital at the 1946 New Year party of the Central Board for Conscientious Objectors.<ref>CBCO Bulletin, December 1945</ref> After a season as principal trumpet with the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] he returned in 1946 to the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra|London Philharmonic]], where he remained until 1948, leaving to become a full-time composer.<ref name=Grove/>\n\n==Career==\nArnold began his career playing [[trumpet]] professionally, but by the age of 30 his life was devoted to composition. He was ranked with [[Benjamin Britten]] as one of the most sought-after composers in Britain.{{cn|date=April 2020}} His natural [[melody|melodic]] gift earned him a reputation as a composer of [[light music]] in works such as some of his concert overtures and the sets of [[Wales|Welsh]], English, Scottish, Irish and Cornish dances. He was also a highly successful composer of film music, penning the scores to over a hundred features and documentaries, including titles such as ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'', ''[[Hobson's Choice (1954 film)|Hobson's Choice]]'' and the [[St Trinian's School|St Trinian's]] series. His nine symphonies are often deeply personal and show a more serious side to his work, which has proved more controversial. Arnold also wrote a variety of concertos and chamber works, as well as music for the theatre including major ballets.\n\n==Later years and death==\nBy 1961 Arnold had a reputation for being unpleasant, frequently drunk and highly promiscuous. He divorced his first wife in that year. His second wife was forced to take out a court order after they separated. After the divorce he made two suicide attempts.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nHis later years saw a decline in both his health and his finances. In 1978 he was treated as an in-patient for several months in the acute psychiatric ward at the [[Royal Free Hospital]], Pond Street, London, and in 1979 he entered [[St Andrew's Hospital]] in his home town of Northampton to be treated for [[clinical depression|depression]] and [[alcoholism]]. He overcame both, despite being given only a year to live in the early 1980s. He lived for 22 more years, albeit with a carer, Anthony Day, and completed his [[Symphony No. 9 (Arnold)|9th]] and [[Curse of the ninth|final symphony]] in 1986. By the time of his 70th birthday in 1991 his artistic reputation with the general public was recovering and he was even able to enjoy a triumphant appearance on the stage of the [[Royal Albert Hall]] to receive an ovation after a Proms performance of his ''Guitar Concerto''.<ref>Meredith and Harris, p 480.</ref>\n\nArnold died at the [[Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital]], [[Norwich]], on 23 September 2006, aged 84, after suffering from a chest infection. That same day his last work, ''The Three Musketeers'', was premiered in a [[Northern Ballet]] production at the [[Bradford Alhambra]]. (The score included no new music by Arnold, but excerpts from various of his compositions were arranged by John Longstaff. The original score was compiled by Anthony Meredith.)\n\nA dispute was fought out over the royalties of Arnold's 9th Symphony. Anthony Day was granted rights, having been left a substantial part of Arnold's estate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-17305381|title=BBC News \u2013 Sir Malcolm Arnold's carer wins battle on final music score|work=BBC News|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{For|a listing of Arnold's musical works|List of compositions by Malcolm Arnold|Category:Compositions by Malcolm Arnold}}\nArnold was a relatively conservative composer of [[tonality|tonal]] works, but a prolific and popular one.

Arnold's most significant works are generally considered to be his nine [[symphony|symphonies]]. He also wrote a number of [[concerto]]s, including one for [[guitar]] for [[Julian Bream]], one for [[cello]] for [[Julian Lloyd Webber]], two for [[clarinet]] for [[Frederick Thurston]] and [[Benny Goodman]] respectively, one for [[harmonica]] for [[Larry Adler]] and one \u2013 enthusiastically welcomed at its premiere during the 1969 [[Proms]] \u2013 for three hands on two pianos for the husband-and-wife team of [[Cyril Smith (pianist)|Cyril Smith]] and [[Phyllis Sellick]]. His sets of dances \u2014 comprising two sets of ''[[English Dances]]'' ([[Opus number|Opp]]. 27 and 33), along with one set each of ''[[Four Scottish Dances|Scottish Dances]]'' (Op. 59), ''[[Cornish Dances]]'' (Op. 91), ''[[Irish Dances]]'' (Op. 126), and ''[[Welsh Dances]]'' (Op. 138) \u2014 are mainly in a lighter vein and are popular both in their original orchestral guise and in later [[wind band|wind]] and [[Brass band|brass]] band arrangements. The ''English Dances'' also form the basis for [[Kenneth MacMillan]]'s short ballet ''[[English Dances#Solitaire|Solitaire]]'', and one of them has been used as the theme music for the British television programme ''[[What the Papers Say]]'' (the ''Cornish Dances'' has provided the theme music for the television programmes of the cook [[Rick Stein]]).

Another popular short work is his ''Divertimento for [[Flute]], [[Oboe]] and [[Clarinet]]'' (Op. 37). Arnold is also known for his relatively large number of compositions and arrangements of his own compositions for [[Brass band (British style)|brass band]]. In 1954, ''Beckus the Dandipratt'' was given a radio studio performance by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under [[Leopold Stokowski]], the only great international conductor to have played any of Arnold's music during the composer's own lifetime, and he was thanked by the composer for his \"wonderful performance.\"  \n\n===Film scores===\nA prolifically successful composer for the cinema, Malcolm Arnold is credited with having written over a hundred [[film score]]s for features and documentaries between 1947 and 1969.<ref>Palmer, Christopher (1992).

His works feature music in many genres, including a cycle of nine symphonies, numerous concertos, concert works, chamber music, choral music and music for brass band and wind band. He wrote extensively for the theatre, with five ballets specially commissioned by the Royal Ballet, as well as two operas and a musical. He also produced scores for more than a hundred films, among these ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' (1957), for which he won an Oscar.\n\n==Early life==\nMalcolm Arnold was born in [[Northampton]], [[Northamptonshire]], England, the youngest of five children from a prosperous Northampton family of shoemakers. Although shoemakers, his family was full of musicians; both of his parents were pianists, and his aunt was a violinist. After seeing [[Louis Armstrong]] play in [[Bournemouth]], he took up the trumpet at the age of 12 and five years later won a scholarship to the [[Royal College of Music]] (R.C.M.).\n\nAt the RCM he studied composition with [[Gordon Jacob]]<ref name=Grove>Grove Concise Dictionary of Music 1988 {{ISBN|0-333-43236-3}}</ref> and the trumpet with Ernest Hall. In 1941 he joined the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]]<ref name=Grove/> (LPO) as second trumpet and became principal trumpet in 1943.\n\nIn 1941 he registered as a [[conscientious objector]], and was initially exempted from military service conditional upon joining the [[National Fire Service]], but in the event he was allowed to continue in the LPO. In 1944, after his brother in the [[Royal Air Force]] had been killed, he volunteered for military service. When the army put him in a military band he shot himself in the foot to get back to civilian life; he remained in touch with the CO movement, giving a trumpet recital at the 1946 New Year party of the Central Board for Conscientious Objectors.<ref>CBCO Bulletin, December 1945</ref> After a season as principal trumpet with the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] he returned in 1946 to the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra|London Philharmonic]], where he remained until 1948, leaving to become a full-time composer.<ref name=Grove/>\n\n==Career==\nArnold began his career playing [[trumpet]] professionally, but by the age of 30 his life was devoted to composition. He was ranked with [[Benjamin Britten]] as one of the most sought-after composers in Britain.{{cn|date=April 2020}} His natural [[melody|melodic]] gift earned him a reputation as a composer of [[light music]] in works such as some of his concert overtures and the sets of [[Wales|Welsh]], English, Scottish, Irish and Cornish dances. He was also a highly successful composer of film music, penning the scores to over a hundred features and documentaries, including titles such as ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'', ''[[Hobson's Choice (1954 film)|Hobson's Choice]]'' and the [[St Trinian's School|St Trinian's]] series. His nine symphonies are often deeply personal and show a more serious side to his work, which has proved more controversial. Arnold also wrote a variety of concertos and chamber works, as well as music for the theatre including major ballets.\n\n==Later years and death==\nBy 1961 Arnold had a reputation for being unpleasant, frequently drunk and highly promiscuous. He divorced his first wife in that year. His second wife was forced to take out a court order after they separated. After the divorce he made two suicide attempts.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nHis later years saw a decline in both his health and his finances. In 1978 he was treated as an in-patient for several months in the acute psychiatric ward at the [[Royal Free Hospital]], Pond Street, London, and in 1979 he entered [[St Andrew's Hospital]] in his home town of Northampton to be treated for [[clinical depression|depression]] and [[alcoholism]]. He overcame both, despite being given only a year to live in the early 1980s. He lived for 22 more years, albeit with a carer, Anthony Day, and completed his [[Symphony No. 9 (Arnold)|9th]] and [[Curse of the ninth|final symphony]] in 1986. By the time of his 70th birthday in 1991 his artistic reputation with the general public was recovering and he was even able to enjoy a triumphant appearance on the stage of the [[Royal Albert Hall]] to receive an ovation after a Proms performance of his ''Guitar Concerto''.<ref>Meredith and Harris, p 480.</ref>\n\nArnold died at the [[Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital]], [[Norwich]], on 23 September 2006, aged 84, after suffering from a chest infection. That same day his last work, ''The Three Musketeers'', was premiered in a [[Northern Ballet]] production at the [[Bradford Alhambra]]. (The score included no new music by Arnold, but excerpts from various of his compositions were arranged by John Longstaff. The original score was compiled by Anthony Meredith.)\n\nA dispute was fought out over the royalties of Arnold's 9th Symphony. Anthony Day was granted rights, having been left a substantial part of Arnold's estate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-17305381|title=BBC News \u2013 Sir Malcolm Arnold's carer wins battle on final music score|work=BBC News|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{For|a listing of Arnold's musical works|List of compositions by Malcolm Arnold|Category:Compositions by Malcolm Arnold}}\nArnold was a relatively conservative composer of [[tonality|tonal]] works, but a prolific and popular one. He acknowledged [[Hector Berlioz]] as an influence, alongside [[Gustav Mahler]], [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] and [[jazz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1529701/Sir-Malcolm-Arnold.html|title=Obituaries: Sir Malcolm Arnold|date=25 September 2006|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> Several commentators have drawn a comparison with [[Jean Sibelius]]. Arnold's most significant works are generally considered to be his nine [[symphony|symphonies]]. He also wrote a number of [[concerto]]s, including one for [[guitar]] for [[Julian Bream]], one for [[cello]] for [[Julian Lloyd Webber]], two for [[clarinet]] for [[Frederick Thurston]] and [[Benny Goodman]] respectively, one for [[harmonica]] for [[Larry Adler]] and one \u2013 enthusiastically welcomed at its premiere during the 1969 [[Proms]] \u2013 for three hands on two pianos for the husband-and-wife team of [[Cyril Smith (pianist)|Cyril Smith]] and [[Phyllis Sellick]]. His sets of dances \u2014 comprising two sets of ''[[English Dances]]'' ([[Opus number|Opp]]. 27 and 33), along with one set each of ''[[Four Scottish Dances|Scottish Dances]]'' (Op. 59), ''[[Cornish Dances]]'' (Op. 91), ''[[Irish Dances]]'' (Op. 126), and ''[[Welsh Dances]]'' (Op. 138) \u2014 are mainly in a lighter vein and are popular both in their original orchestral guise and in later [[wind band|wind]] and [[Brass band|brass]] band arrangements. The ''English Dances'' also form the basis for [[Kenneth MacMillan]]'s short ballet ''[[English Dances#Solitaire|Solitaire]]'', and one of them has been used as the theme music for the British television programme ''[[What the Papers Say]]'' (the ''Cornish Dances'' has provided the theme music for the television programmes of the cook [[Rick Stein]]). Arnold also wrote some highly successful concert overtures,<ref name=overtures>Cooke, Mervyn (2005).

Another popular short work is his ''Divertimento for [[Flute]], [[Oboe]] and [[Clarinet]]'' (Op. 37). Arnold is also known for his relatively large number of compositions and arrangements of his own compositions for [[Brass band (British style)|brass band]]. In 1954, ''Beckus the Dandipratt'' was given a radio studio performance by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under [[Leopold Stokowski]], the only great international conductor to have played any of Arnold's music during the composer's own lifetime, and he was thanked by the composer for his \"wonderful performance.\"  \n\n===Film scores===\nA prolifically successful composer for the cinema, Malcolm Arnold is credited with having written over a hundred [[film score]]s for features and documentaries between 1947 and 1969.<ref>Palmer, Christopher (1992).

From his early writings on ideology and social science, to his work on agonism and identity in the 1990s, to his most recent writings on capitalism and climate change, Connolly has warned against the dangers of rooting democratic theory in final foundations or fixed identities in favor of a pluralizing vision of democracy as the agnostic care for difference. The rhizome, not the root, is the better symbol for Connolly\u2019s democratic imaginary ... While there can be no core idea uniting his corpus, pluralism is certainly crucially important within an assemblage of political concepts, including agonistic respective, critical generosity, tactics of the self, micropolitics, the visceral register, resonance machines, the capitalist axiomatic, and entangled humanism.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.suhrkamp.de/buecher/radikale_demokratietheorie-_29848.html|title=Radikale Demokratietheorie: Ein Handbuch Hg.: Dagmar Comtesse, Oliver Fl\u00fcgel-Martinsen, Franziska Martinsen, Martin Nonhoff - Suhrkamp Insel B\u00fccher Buchdetail|website=www.suhrkamp.de|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nConnolly was raised in the town of [[Flint, Michigan]]. His father was of one of the nearly 80,000 people who worked for [[General Motors]] in Flint during its peak years. Connolly received his B.A. from [[University of Michigan]] at Flint, and went to get his Ph.D. at [[University of Michigan]], Ann Arbor. Connolly took up an assistant professorship at [[Ohio University]] from 1965 to 1968, then an assistant professorship at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] from 1968 to 1971. He later went on to become an associate professor from 1971 to 1974 and professor from 1974 to 1985. \nConnolly took up a professorship in 1985 at [[Johns Hopkins University]] and was the Department Chair for Political Science from 1996 to 2003. He remains the Krieger-Eisenhower Professor today. Connolly has taught as a visiting professor at numerous schools including The [[University of Exeter]], [[European University Institute]], [[Oxford University]], and [[Boston College]]. His book ''The Terms of Political Discourse'' won the Benjamin Evans Lippincott Award in 1999:  the book is widely held to be a major work of political theory. In 2004, he won the [[Fulbright Award]] to deliver the keynote address at the [[Kyoto]] Conference in Japan. In 2013 Connolly delivered the inaugural [http://poli-sci.utah.edu/maxwell-lecture-series.php Neal A. Maxwell Lecture in Political Theory and Contemporary Politics] at the University of Utah entitled \u201cSpecies Evolution and Cultural Freedom.\u201d It was subsequently published as part of a symposium in Political Research Quarterly. Connolly is also a contributing writer to [[The Huffington Post]] and a founding member of the journal ''Theory & Event''.\n\n==Political theory==\n\n===The theory of pluralism===\nOver the course of the last four decades Connolly has helped to remake the theory of [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]]. Connolly challenges older theories of pluralism by arguing for pluralization as a goal rather than as a state of affairs. Connolly's argument for the \"multiplication of factions\" follows [[James Madison]]'s logic in engaging groups, constituencies, and voters at both the micro and macro level. Essentially, he has shifted the theory from a conservative theory of order, to a progressive theory of democratic contestation and engagement.<ref>{{cite book | last = Chambers & Carver | first = Samuel & Terrell  | title = William E. Connolly: Democracy, Pluralism and Political Theory | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780415431231}}</ref> By engaging [[Nietzsche]] and [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], Connolly explores the nature of democratic contestation and its relation to pluralism. A more comprehensive look on pluralism can be found in the work ''Pluralism''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Connolly| first = William | title = Pluralism | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-8223-3567-2}}</ref>\n\nAn extensive engagement with Connolly can be found in ''The New Pluralism'' (Duke University Press, 2008), edited by David Campbell and Morton Schoolman.<ref>{{Cite book |isbn = 978-0822342700|title = The New Pluralism: William Connolly and the Contemporary Global Condition|last1 = Campbell|first1 = David|last2 = Schoolman|first2 = Morton|date = 2008-05-26}}</ref> There Morton Schoolman, Thomas Dumm, George Kateb, Wendy Brown, Stephen White, Bonnie Honig, Roland Bleiker, Michael Shapiro, Kathy Ferguson, [[James Der Derian]], and David Campbell engage his accounts of pluralism, [[cosmopolitanism]], agonistic respect, [[subjectivity]], politics and global capitalism. The book closes with an interview in which the editors invite Connolly to clarify several themes and to outline his future work. This work has been acknowledged as an authoritative text on Connolly's thought.\n\n===Agonistic democracy===\nConnolly is one of the founders of this subfield of thought in political theory. He promotes the possibility of an \"[[agonistic democracy]]\", where he finds positive ways to engage certain aspects of political conflict. Connolly proposes a positive ethos of engagement, which could be used to debate political differences.  [[Agonism]] is based on contestation, but in a political space where the discourse is one of respect, rather than violence. However, Connolly is cautious on speculating whether this imagination could come true, because he claims the value of such speculation is overrated. Also, his critical challenges to [[John Rawls]]'s [[A Theory of Justice|theory of justice]] and [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]]'s theory on [[deliberative democracy]] have spawned a host of new literature in this area. His work ''Identity\\Difference'' contains an exhaustive look at positive possibilities via democratic contestation.<ref>{{cite book | last = Connolly| first = William | title = Identity\\Difference: Democratic Negotiations of Political Paradox | publisher = [[University of Minnesota Press]] | location = Minneapolis | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-8166-4086-7}}</ref>\n\n===Secularism===\nConnolly has explored some of the problematic aspects of [[secularism]]. He notes the predictive failure of secularists in the 1970s, who theorized it would be the most dominant view in the public sphere, only to be proven wrong by the evangelical movement that dominated politics for two decades soon after. He writes that, \"Secularism is not merely the division between public and private realms that allows religious diversity to flourish in the latter. It can itself be a carrier of harsh exclusions. And it secretes a new definition of \"religion\" that conceals some of its most problematic practices from itself.\" Connolly has also written on the relationship between religion and faith in politics, arguing for non-believers to respect the views of the faithful, who make up a large portion of the electorate. His work, ''Why I am Not a Secularist'' explores some of these ideas in further detail.<ref>{{cite book | last = Connolly| first = William | title = Why I am Not a Secularist| publisher = University of Minnesota Press | location = Minneapolis | year = 2000 | isbn =  978-0-8166-3332-6}}</ref> \n\n\"Echoing his early critique of value-neutrality, Connolly charges liberal secularists for failing to acknowledge... the ways their own parochial sensibilities and metaphysical investments infuse their supposedly neutral statements about a post-metaphysical public reason. Connolly calls for a post-secularist politics that admits the ubiquity of faith in order to negotiate across these embodied registers of difference rather than claim, and fail, to transcend them.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Neuropolitics ===\nDrawing on recent research in neuroscience on the role of affect in cognition, along with the theories of thinkers such as Baruch Spinoza, Henri Bergson, and William James, Connolly plumbs the depths of the \u201cvisceral register\u201d, both in ''Why I am Not a Secularist'' (2000) and particularly in his 2002 book ''Neuropolitics''. \"Rationalist and deliberative theories of democracy fail to grasp the ways visceral modes of appraisal affect political thinking below the conscious register of reasons and argument alone. Moods, affects, and instincts of considerable intensity infuse both subjectivity and intersubjectivity with powerful cultural investments. The existence of this register of experience transgresses any neat compartmentalization of private spirituality from public reason. Echoing his early critique of value-neutrality, Connolly charges liberal secularists for failing to acknowledge the role of the visceral register in their own thinking and the ways their own parochial sensibilities and metaphysical investments infuse their supposedly neutral statements about a post-metaphysical public reason.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Capitalism and Ecology ===\nIn his recent books Connolly has explored the relations between capitalism, inequality and ecology. In ''Capitalism and Christianity, American Style'' (2008) he explores the formation of the \u201cevangelical-capitalist resonance machine\u201d in the States,  explaining how it has made the United States an outlier among the older capitalist states with respect to inequality and climate denialism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Capitalism and Christianity, American Style|last=Connolly|first=William|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8223-4272-4|location=Durham|pages=}}</ref> Reviewing the book for the ''Political Theory'' journal, University of Wisconsin-Madison political theorist Robert Fowler writes: \"Whether it is theory or practice that he addresses, Connolly always moves with an eye to enhancing certain attitudes: a disposition toward uncertainty; an openness to any approach that might give insight; a rejection of any tight system; avoidance of the danger posed by a life or a politics of resentment. Above all, Connolly lauds an attitude that recognizes the tragic in life (serving to blunt dangerous faiths in a providential God or in the blessings of the market), while at the same time eagerly welcoming a determination to change the world for the better. Finally, Connolly insists that his ardent desire for change does not negate an attitude of human \"gratitude for this world\" (p. 144) nor suck dry the ineffable \"sweetness of life\" (p. 146).\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fowler|first=Robert Booth|date=2009|title=Review of Capitalism and Christianity, American Style|journal=Political Theory|volume=37|issue=3|pages=442\u2013445|issn=0090-5917|jstor=25655490|doi=10.1177/0090591709332341}}</ref>\n\nIn ''The Fragility of Things'' (2013),  he criticizes neoliberalism for its quaint focus on only one self-organizing system\u2014markets.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Fragility of Things: Self-Organizing Processes, Neoliberal Fantasies, and Democratic Activism|last=Connolly|first=William|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-8223-5584-7|location=Durham|pages=}}</ref>  It is not only that markets are also subject to elite manipulation, it is also the case that neoliberal states bump into a whole series of nonhuman processes with self-organizing powers of their own. When you consider these interconnected systems together the fragility of capitalism comes  into view and the irrationality of neoliberal ideals of market autonomy shines through. In a recent book, ''Facing the Planetary: Entangled Humanism and the Politics of Swarming'' (2017)  Connolly reviews how the earth scientists belatedly exploded their previous notions of \u201cplanetary gradualism\u201d in the 1980s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Facing the Planetary: Entangled Humanism and the Politics of Swarming|last=Connolly|first=William|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2017|isbn=978-0-8223-6341-5|location=Durham|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/facingplanetary00conn}}</ref> After discussing how climate, glacier flows, species evolution and the ocean conveyor have gone through periods of stability punctuated by rather rapid changes, he pursues a philosophy of \u201centangled humanism\u201d and a \u201cpolitics of swarming\u201d to respond to the contemporary conjunction between bumpy, self-organizing planetary forces and contemporary capitalism as a geologic force.\n\n=== Aspirational Fascism and Climate Machines ===\nIn the last few years Connolly has pursued further how to bring the new earth sciences -- with their sharp critiques of their own earlier doctrine of planetary gradualism -- into closer contact with the humanities and the social sciences.\u00a0And vice versa. He has also explored how new fascist pressures emerge in part out of disavowed constituency anxieties regarding the acceleration of the Anthropocene.\u00a0''Aspirational Fascism'' (2017) explores the bellicose reactions of the white working class to its fraught location between neoliberal strategies of extreme wealth, income and security stratification and noble pluralizing drives advanced by several other constituencies. The nature of Trump's rhetorical tactics and the power of his strategies of affective contagion are explored in that account. That study closes with a discussion of how pluralism and egalitarianism must be drawn closer together today to transcend the threat of aspirational fascism. \n\nIn ''Climate Machines, Fascist Drives and Truth'' (2019) he pulls on three threads -- the earth sciences, the changing shape of capitalism, and resurgent fascist pressures. He shows how research into earlier planetary eruptions can help to understand the accelerating pace of the Anthropocene today, how capitalism is intimately imbricated with planetary processes that also have a degree of autonomy of their own, and how climate denialism and fascist temptations work hand in hand today. Reforms urgently needed in the humanities and social sciences might help critical intellectuals and students overcome \"sociocentrism\", to grapple with these complex interinvolvements more fully, and to help reshape citizen attitudes. \u00a0\n\n==Critics==\nIn a 2008 national survey of political theorists, based on 1,086 responses from professors at accredited, four-year colleges and universities in the United States, William E. Connolly was voted 4th on the list of \"Scholars Who Have Had the Greatest Impact on Political Theory in the Past 20 Years\", behind John Rawls, J\u00fcrgen Habermas, and Michel Foucault. Connolly was also voted 3rd on the list of \"Scholars Doing Excellent Work Today Whose Work Will Be Influential during the Next 20 Years\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Matthew J.|date=2009|title=Political Theory Today: Results of a National Survey|language=en|location=Rochester, NY|ssrn=1463648}}</ref>\n\nUCLA political theorist Joshua F.

He is the Krieger-Eisenhower Professor of Political Science at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. His 1974 work ''The Terms of Political Discourse'' won the 1999 Benjamin Lippincott Award.<ref>{{cite book | last = Chambers & Carver | first = Samuel & Terrell  | title = William E.

From his early writings on ideology and social science, to his work on agonism and identity in the 1990s, to his most recent writings on capitalism and climate change, Connolly has warned against the dangers of rooting democratic theory in final foundations or fixed identities in favor of a pluralizing vision of democracy as the agnostic care for difference. The rhizome, not the root, is the better symbol for Connolly\u2019s democratic imaginary ... While there can be no core idea uniting his corpus, pluralism is certainly crucially important within an assemblage of political concepts, including agonistic respective, critical generosity, tactics of the self, micropolitics, the visceral register, resonance machines, the capitalist axiomatic, and entangled humanism.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.suhrkamp.de/buecher/radikale_demokratietheorie-_29848.html|title=Radikale Demokratietheorie: Ein Handbuch Hg.: Dagmar Comtesse, Oliver Fl\u00fcgel-Martinsen, Franziska Martinsen, Martin Nonhoff - Suhrkamp Insel B\u00fccher Buchdetail|website=www.suhrkamp.de|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nConnolly was raised in the town of [[Flint, Michigan]]. His father was of one of the nearly 80,000 people who worked for [[General Motors]] in Flint during its peak years. Connolly received his B.A. from [[University of Michigan]] at Flint, and went to get his Ph.D. at [[University of Michigan]], Ann Arbor. Connolly took up an assistant professorship at [[Ohio University]] from 1965 to 1968, then an assistant professorship at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] from 1968 to 1971. He later went on to become an associate professor from 1971 to 1974 and professor from 1974 to 1985. \nConnolly took up a professorship in 1985 at [[Johns Hopkins University]] and was the Department Chair for Political Science from 1996 to 2003. He remains the Krieger-Eisenhower Professor today. Connolly has taught as a visiting professor at numerous schools including The [[University of Exeter]], [[European University Institute]], [[Oxford University]], and [[Boston College]]. His book ''The Terms of Political Discourse'' won the Benjamin Evans Lippincott Award in 1999:  the book is widely held to be a major work of political theory. In 2004, he won the [[Fulbright Award]] to deliver the keynote address at the [[Kyoto]] Conference in Japan. In 2013 Connolly delivered the inaugural [http://poli-sci.utah.edu/maxwell-lecture-series.php Neal A. Maxwell Lecture in Political Theory and Contemporary Politics] at the University of Utah entitled \u201cSpecies Evolution and Cultural Freedom.\u201d It was subsequently published as part of a symposium in Political Research Quarterly. Connolly is also a contributing writer to [[The Huffington Post]] and a founding member of the journal ''Theory & Event''.\n\n==Political theory==\n\n===The theory of pluralism===\nOver the course of the last four decades Connolly has helped to remake the theory of [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]]. Connolly challenges older theories of pluralism by arguing for pluralization as a goal rather than as a state of affairs. Connolly's argument for the \"multiplication of factions\" follows [[James Madison]]'s logic in engaging groups, constituencies, and voters at both the micro and macro level. Essentially, he has shifted the theory from a conservative theory of order, to a progressive theory of democratic contestation and engagement.<ref>{{cite book | last = Chambers & Carver | first = Samuel & Terrell  | title = William E. Connolly: Democracy, Pluralism and Political Theory | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780415431231}}</ref> By engaging [[Nietzsche]] and [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], Connolly explores the nature of democratic contestation and its relation to pluralism. A more comprehensive look on pluralism can be found in the work ''Pluralism''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Connolly| first = William | title = Pluralism | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-8223-3567-2}}</ref>\n\nAn extensive engagement with Connolly can be found in ''The New Pluralism'' (Duke University Press, 2008), edited by David Campbell and Morton Schoolman.<ref>{{Cite book |isbn = 978-0822342700|title = The New Pluralism: William Connolly and the Contemporary Global Condition|last1 = Campbell|first1 = David|last2 = Schoolman|first2 = Morton|date = 2008-05-26}}</ref> There Morton Schoolman, Thomas Dumm, George Kateb, Wendy Brown, Stephen White, Bonnie Honig, Roland Bleiker, Michael Shapiro, Kathy Ferguson, [[James Der Derian]], and David Campbell engage his accounts of pluralism, [[cosmopolitanism]], agonistic respect, [[subjectivity]], politics and global capitalism. The book closes with an interview in which the editors invite Connolly to clarify several themes and to outline his future work. This work has been acknowledged as an authoritative text on Connolly's thought.\n\n===Agonistic democracy===\nConnolly is one of the founders of this subfield of thought in political theory. He promotes the possibility of an \"[[agonistic democracy]]\", where he finds positive ways to engage certain aspects of political conflict. Connolly proposes a positive ethos of engagement, which could be used to debate political differences.  [[Agonism]] is based on contestation, but in a political space where the discourse is one of respect, rather than violence. However, Connolly is cautious on speculating whether this imagination could come true, because he claims the value of such speculation is overrated. Also, his critical challenges to [[John Rawls]]'s [[A Theory of Justice|theory of justice]] and [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]]'s theory on [[deliberative democracy]] have spawned a host of new literature in this area. His work ''Identity\\Difference'' contains an exhaustive look at positive possibilities via democratic contestation.<ref>{{cite book | last = Connolly| first = William | title = Identity\\Difference: Democratic Negotiations of Political Paradox | publisher = [[University of Minnesota Press]] | location = Minneapolis | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-8166-4086-7}}</ref>\n\n===Secularism===\nConnolly has explored some of the problematic aspects of [[secularism]]. He notes the predictive failure of secularists in the 1970s, who theorized it would be the most dominant view in the public sphere, only to be proven wrong by the evangelical movement that dominated politics for two decades soon after. He writes that, \"Secularism is not merely the division between public and private realms that allows religious diversity to flourish in the latter. It can itself be a carrier of harsh exclusions. And it secretes a new definition of \"religion\" that conceals some of its most problematic practices from itself.\" Connolly has also written on the relationship between religion and faith in politics, arguing for non-believers to respect the views of the faithful, who make up a large portion of the electorate. His work, ''Why I am Not a Secularist'' explores some of these ideas in further detail.<ref>{{cite book | last = Connolly| first = William | title = Why I am Not a Secularist| publisher = University of Minnesota Press | location = Minneapolis | year = 2000 | isbn =  978-0-8166-3332-6}}</ref> \n\n\"Echoing his early critique of value-neutrality, Connolly charges liberal secularists for failing to acknowledge... the ways their own parochial sensibilities and metaphysical investments infuse their supposedly neutral statements about a post-metaphysical public reason. Connolly calls for a post-secularist politics that admits the ubiquity of faith in order to negotiate across these embodied registers of difference rather than claim, and fail, to transcend them.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Neuropolitics ===\nDrawing on recent research in neuroscience on the role of affect in cognition, along with the theories of thinkers such as Baruch Spinoza, Henri Bergson, and William James, Connolly plumbs the depths of the \u201cvisceral register\u201d, both in ''Why I am Not a Secularist'' (2000) and particularly in his 2002 book ''Neuropolitics''. \"Rationalist and deliberative theories of democracy fail to grasp the ways visceral modes of appraisal affect political thinking below the conscious register of reasons and argument alone. Moods, affects, and instincts of considerable intensity infuse both subjectivity and intersubjectivity with powerful cultural investments. The existence of this register of experience transgresses any neat compartmentalization of private spirituality from public reason. Echoing his early critique of value-neutrality, Connolly charges liberal secularists for failing to acknowledge the role of the visceral register in their own thinking and the ways their own parochial sensibilities and metaphysical investments infuse their supposedly neutral statements about a post-metaphysical public reason.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Capitalism and Ecology ===\nIn his recent books Connolly has explored the relations between capitalism, inequality and ecology. In ''Capitalism and Christianity, American Style'' (2008) he explores the formation of the \u201cevangelical-capitalist resonance machine\u201d in the States,  explaining how it has made the United States an outlier among the older capitalist states with respect to inequality and climate denialism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Capitalism and Christianity, American Style|last=Connolly|first=William|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8223-4272-4|location=Durham|pages=}}</ref> Reviewing the book for the ''Political Theory'' journal, University of Wisconsin-Madison political theorist Robert Fowler writes: \"Whether it is theory or practice that he addresses, Connolly always moves with an eye to enhancing certain attitudes: a disposition toward uncertainty; an openness to any approach that might give insight; a rejection of any tight system; avoidance of the danger posed by a life or a politics of resentment. Above all, Connolly lauds an attitude that recognizes the tragic in life (serving to blunt dangerous faiths in a providential God or in the blessings of the market), while at the same time eagerly welcoming a determination to change the world for the better. Finally, Connolly insists that his ardent desire for change does not negate an attitude of human \"gratitude for this world\" (p. 144) nor suck dry the ineffable \"sweetness of life\" (p. 146).\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fowler|first=Robert Booth|date=2009|title=Review of Capitalism and Christianity, American Style|journal=Political Theory|volume=37|issue=3|pages=442\u2013445|issn=0090-5917|jstor=25655490|doi=10.1177/0090591709332341}}</ref>\n\nIn ''The Fragility of Things'' (2013),  he criticizes neoliberalism for its quaint focus on only one self-organizing system\u2014markets.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Fragility of Things: Self-Organizing Processes, Neoliberal Fantasies, and Democratic Activism|last=Connolly|first=William|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-8223-5584-7|location=Durham|pages=}}</ref>  It is not only that markets are also subject to elite manipulation, it is also the case that neoliberal states bump into a whole series of nonhuman processes with self-organizing powers of their own. When you consider these interconnected systems together the fragility of capitalism comes  into view and the irrationality of neoliberal ideals of market autonomy shines through. In a recent book, ''Facing the Planetary: Entangled Humanism and the Politics of Swarming'' (2017)  Connolly reviews how the earth scientists belatedly exploded their previous notions of \u201cplanetary gradualism\u201d in the 1980s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Facing the Planetary: Entangled Humanism and the Politics of Swarming|last=Connolly|first=William|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2017|isbn=978-0-8223-6341-5|location=Durham|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/facingplanetary00conn}}</ref> After discussing how climate, glacier flows, species evolution and the ocean conveyor have gone through periods of stability punctuated by rather rapid changes, he pursues a philosophy of \u201centangled humanism\u201d and a \u201cpolitics of swarming\u201d to respond to the contemporary conjunction between bumpy, self-organizing planetary forces and contemporary capitalism as a geologic force.\n\n=== Aspirational Fascism and Climate Machines ===\nIn the last few years Connolly has pursued further how to bring the new earth sciences -- with their sharp critiques of their own earlier doctrine of planetary gradualism -- into closer contact with the humanities and the social sciences.\u00a0And vice versa. He has also explored how new fascist pressures emerge in part out of disavowed constituency anxieties regarding the acceleration of the Anthropocene.\u00a0''Aspirational Fascism'' (2017) explores the bellicose reactions of the white working class to its fraught location between neoliberal strategies of extreme wealth, income and security stratification and noble pluralizing drives advanced by several other constituencies. The nature of Trump's rhetorical tactics and the power of his strategies of affective contagion are explored in that account. That study closes with a discussion of how pluralism and egalitarianism must be drawn closer together today to transcend the threat of aspirational fascism. \n\nIn ''Climate Machines, Fascist Drives and Truth'' (2019) he pulls on three threads -- the earth sciences, the changing shape of capitalism, and resurgent fascist pressures. He shows how research into earlier planetary eruptions can help to understand the accelerating pace of the Anthropocene today, how capitalism is intimately imbricated with planetary processes that also have a degree of autonomy of their own, and how climate denialism and fascist temptations work hand in hand today. Reforms urgently needed in the humanities and social sciences might help critical intellectuals and students overcome \"sociocentrism\", to grapple with these complex interinvolvments more fully, and to help reshape citizen attitudes. \u00a0\n\n==Critics==\nIn a 2008 national survey of political theorists, based on 1,086 responses from professors at accredited, four-year colleges and universities in the United States, William E.
