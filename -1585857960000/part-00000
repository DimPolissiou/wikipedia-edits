Dozens of brothels thrived on the outskirts of central [[Warsaw]] since its establishment as the national capital in the sixteenth century, as in other large Polish cities and towns. These cities established municipal brothels and taxed both prostitutes and brothelkeepers. The first recorded brothel (Dom publiczny - literally public house) in Poland is considered to be in [[Bochnia]] in the 15th century, which catered to merchants who came to buy salt from the mines there.\n<ref name=boch>{{cite web|url=http://republika.pl/bochenskie/rozpusta.html|title=Onet \u2013 Jeste\u015b na bie\u017c\u0105co|website=republika.pl}}</ref>\n\nA Hungarian explorer to Poland in the early seventeenth century, [[M\u00e1rton Szepsi Csombor]], wrote that when he passed through [[Lipnica Murowana]] they were \"surrounded by a swarm of unclean maidens to flatter and compliment us and play and sing\". In Bochnia the city authorities from time to time passed ordinances against \"harlots and loose people\". In 1610 the mayor and town councilors appointed fines, and an ordinance from 1743 called for severe punishment for adultery. The trade guilds demanded a proper \"moral\" life of its members, one of the articles of the butcher's guild set a payment of 12 cents into a box for \"debauchery or starting a conversation with a married woman\".\n<ref name=boch/>\n\nFrom the fifteenth century police inspected brothels and removed women thought to be infected. The sixteenth century saw the establishment of [[venereal disease]] hospitals such as St. Sebastian's in [[Krakow]] in 1528 and St. Lazarus, in Warsaw.\n\n=== Nineteenth century (Polish Partition) ===\nDuring the period of [[History of Poland#Partitioned Poland|Polish Partition]] (1795\u20131918) prostitution flourished openly, whereas previously ([[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]) (1648\u20131795) it had been confined to brothels and back streets near army garrisons. The official position of the occupying Russian authorities was that prostitution was a \"necessary evil\" (''z\u0142o konieczne''), and reflected the administration of prostitution in [[Russia]]. Administration was the responsibility of the police under the Ministry of the Interior. Local committees made of police and physicians administered the regulations.\n<ref name=politika>{{cite web|url=http://www.polityka.pl/historia/204515,1,sprzedajnosc-niewiast-na-ziemiach-polskich.read#axzz1EFQazsQ9|title=Sprzedajno\u015b\u0107 niewiast na ziemiach polskich|date=2009-11-04}}</ref>\n\nPolish garrisons had their own brothels, and as Europe progressively adopted the Napoleonic system of regulation, state-regulated prostitution became established in 1802 (in Prussian and Russian Poland) and in 1859 in Austrian [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. In 1843 the Russian governor introduced a tax on brothels and prostitution, and 30 years later created the committees to oversee regulation. The regulations required all women in commercial sex to register and undergo regular gynaecological examinations which were recorded in 'passports'. Despite this, there existed an illegal sector of women who chose not to become part of the public register.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Simonton|first1=Deborah|title=The Routledge History of Women in Europe Since 1700|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134419067|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hx5tyNkDQ7AC&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=1843+prostitute+registration+poland#v=onepage&q=1843%20prostitute%20registration%20poland&f=false|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAs police regulated zoning of brothels away from the public eye, professional prostitutes moved toward working as independents. Regulations were very detailed. The police allowed a premise to open if it was situated at least 315 metres from a church or school, while advertising was prohibited. Other regulations included forbidding a premise to operate under the guise of another institution, such as cafes and billiard room. Portraits of the Royal Family or other state symbols were forbidden, as was hanging out of windows incompletely dressed. Fees varied with the class of institution and proprietors kept three quarters of the proceeds, for overheads. There was no charge for the treatment of [[syphilis]]. The public could inspect the medical records before selecting a worker \u2013 but she could refuse a client if he was drunk. Although there were penalties for overworking the women, they were obliged to service 10\u201312 clients a day. Similar regulations were in effect in the [[Prussia]]n-occupied territories. The [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was less centrally controlled than that of Russia and Prussia. On the other hand, women could be transported anywhere in the empire. Under [[Empress Maria Theresa]] and the ''[[Constitutio criminalis Theresiana]]'', things were less tolerant, and amongst other things the Morals Police were introduced, although ultimately all these measures proved futile.\n<ref name=politika/>\n\nIn parallel, police closed many of the larger brothels due to public pressure. Police had the powers to forcibly register women they suspected, which could simply be women having relationships outside of marriage.\n\nA number of factors contributed to the growth of the sex trade in nineteenth century Poland, including increasing urbanisation, with growing cities and a population shift from the land to the towns and cities. The increasing feminisation of poverty was also a contributing factor. So prevalent was paid sex amongst domestic servants, that a 1913 regulation required them to register for medical exams as well. A second class was waitresses, and after 1906, they too were registered.\n\nAs the supply increased, so did the demand. 40% of Warsaw university students stated that their first sexual encounter was commercial, and estimates at the time suggested that over 80% of high school and university students bought sex. As throughout history, the military were a major source of demand, and because of concerns about venereal disease, authorities instituted regulations similar to those in the [[British Empire]] ([[Contagious Diseases Acts]]), requiring any young woman on her own to submit to examination.\n\n{{seealso|Alfonse Pogrom}}\n\nA great deal of attention began to be paid to prostitution during this period. This increased attention needs<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Stauter-Halsted|first1=Keely|title=Moral Panic and the Prostitute in Partitioned Poland: Middle-Class Respectability in Defense of the Modern Nation|journal=Slavic Review |volume=68|issue=3 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290923316 |accessdate=16 April 2018|pages=557\u2013581+ix|doi=10.1017/S0037677900019744|date=1 September 2009}}</ref> to be interpreted in the light of nineteenth century European attitudes to prostitution, where it was becoming the subject of almost daily discourse. A second wave of moral panic also swept Poland during the [[Second Republic of Poland|Second Republic]] (1918\u20131939). However what was often neglected was that Polish sex workers comprised a potentially upwardly mobile, economically ambitious lower class, that contributed significantly to Polish social and economic life.\n\nHousehold servants, nursemaids, and wet nurses were among those known to rely on commercial sex to supplement their low wages, while middle-class husbands and their adolescent sons became regular clientele. Unsavoury images of prostitution, such as [[Jack the Ripper]] ''\"Kuba rozpruwacz\"'' were imported from abroad.\n\nPhysicians sounded the alarm about a rise in syphilis rates, while the Roman Catholic Church, middle-class charities, and Jewish aid agencies set up societies to rescue \"fallen women\" from the wages of sin. Chastity or \"purity\" societies, and women's groups organized meetings and conferences. Feminists composed moral treatises and established international organizations to combat trafficking of women. \"[[White slavery (prostitution)|White slavery]]\" attracted much media attention as in other countries. However, the bulk of the concern related to the open display of solicitation in public places. Public discourse emphasised not only this deviant behaviour but also the victim role, trapped and in the hands of pimps and traffickers. These stories were mingled with [[antisemitism]], as the perpetrators (like infamous [[Zvi Migdal]]) were frequently depicted as [[Jewish]]. These scenes also appeared in the literature of the day, such as [[Bronislaw Szczygielski]]'s ''A Woman - A Body: The Odyssey of a Fallen Woman'' (Kobieta-Cialo: Odyseja kobiety upadlej, Warsaw, 1914).\n<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/pss/25621657 Moral Panic and the Prostitute in Partitioned Poland: Middle-Class Respectability in Defence of the Modern Nation.

Naturally separate institutions were required for officers, non-commissioned officers, and privates.\n<ref name=politika/>\n\n=== Second Republic (1918\u20131939) ===\nThe new Polish authorities were faced with a large number of problems arising from the recently ceased hostilitiies. One of the first acts of the newly reconstituted nation was the Basic Sanitation Law of July 1919 (Zasadnicza ustawa sanitarna). Under this law brothels were suppressed on 6 September 1922, while setting up a system of supervision of independent workers. A maximum of two workers were allowed in any house.\n<ref name=politika/>\n\nThe State brought many cases of prosecution against organised prostitution and pimps during this period.\n\n=== Postwar period (People's Republic 1945-1989) ===\nUnder the post [[Second World War]] [[communist]] [[People's Republic of Poland|regime]] prostitution did not exist officially but was nevertheless widespread. People who extorted sex workers could be prosecuted though.\n<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,907175,00.html|title=POLAND: The Hard-Currency Girls|journal=Time|date=7 May 1973|via=www.time.com}}</ref>\n\nIt was a maxim of Marxism, that prostitution would disappear in a socialist society with equality of means.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wattpad.com/349431?p=1|title=Marek Karpi\u0144ski: Najstarszy zaw\u00f3d \u015bwiata.

As such prostitution formed an important source of hard currency. Despite this the Republic's special services were actually running hotel rings. In this way they could obtain information about foreigners, compromise and extort people.\n\n==== 1945-1948 ====\nIn the initial years (1945 - 1948) there was a registration scheme, and special sections were set up to deal with \"enemies of morality\" (''wrogami moralno\u015bci''), but this was abolished when other priorities engaged the State. 1948-1952 saw forced labor camps. Despite continued efforts to eradicate prostitution, many elements of centrally-planned socialism actually contributed to it, such as the 'Great Socialist Construction' (''wielkie budowy socjalizmu'') which saw migration of large numbers of men. A memo from the Secretariat of the Party Central Committee (including [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]] who was then Secretary General), dated 23 November 1955, states that in 1949 there were 4,000 sex workers in Poland, in 1954 1,700 and that 6,000 had been arrested. It also refers to the difficulties in the struggle to abolish the practice. It refers to the prewar period when \"prostitution not only was not a crime,\nbut on the contrary - officially recognized and protected by the state\". Data from the Ministry of the Interior, dated 9 February 1957 refer to 1,500 workers in the six major cities.\n\n==== 1960-1983 ====\nThe period from the 1960s saw a slight ideological \"thaw\" that culminated in the fall of the [[iron curtain]] (\u017belazna kurtyna) in 1989. Changes in Polish society included increasing tourism and trade with the West, acceptability of foreign currency and an expanding hotel business, all factors conducive to the growth of the sex trade. Although liable to a large error margin, estimates of the numbers of sex workers were 7,267 in 1962, and 9847 in 1969. Sometimes referred to as \"Servants of Venus\" (S\u0142u\u017cebnice Wenery), sex workers started to become one of the higher income earning groups. Venues included market towns, port cities, hotels and environs and around railway stations. Well known areas for the less wealthy included the East Side and cafes along [[Aleje Jerozolimskie]] as well as the famous ''Pigalak'' area in [[Warsaw]].\n\nThis period was notable for a criminal case involving the porters at the [[Hotel Europejski]] who were living off the trade they supplied. However these prosecutions were the exception in a trade largely opaque to the authorities and an important part of the economy. A single client could net a sex worker the equivalent of an average monthly wage, and some could make the same as corporate executives. Both workers and clients benefited - for instance a US10 fee for a \"short service\" was very affordable for foreign visitors, and only 20% of prices in West Germany.\n\n==== Martial Law (1981\u20131983) and the liberalisation of the 80s ====\nThe [[Martial law in Poland|martial law]] (Stan wojenny) period was a difficult time for sex workers, but quickly gave way to a more liberal period. However the [[AIDS]] epidemic also reduced demand for paid sex. This was partly offset by the reduction in [[Censorship in the People's Republic of Poland|censorship]], allowing newspaper advertising, for instance in ''Kurier Polski''. This period also saw the arrival of escort businesses.\n\n==== Research ====\nBecause of ideological reasons, there was very little research done during this time, other in forensic literature,\n<ref>Antoniszyn M., Marek A.: Prostytucja w \u015bwietle bada\u0144 kryminologicznych. Warszawa 1985.</ref>\nat least until the 90s. Examples include Pawlik's study of [[Cracow]] prostitutes (1991)\n<ref>I. Pawlik: Krakowskie prostytutki. Dworc\u00f3wki, arabeski, makaroniary.

Escort agencies, erotic massage salons, porn movie\ntheaters and sex shops appeared very soon. Escort agencies are registered businesses, and circumvent laws.

Poland has become a transit country for sex workers from [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]], while the biggest group of sex workers in Poland is from  [[Ukraine]].

Although there were penalties for overworking the women, they were obliged to service 10\u201312 clients a day. Similar regulations were in effect in the [[Prussia]]n-occupied territories. The [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was less centrally controlled than that of Russia and Prussia. On the other hand, women could be transported anywhere in the empire. Under [[Empress Maria Theresa]] and the ''[[Constitutio criminalis Theresiana]]'', things were less tolerant, and amongst other things the Morals Police were introduced, although ultimately all these measures proved futile.\n<ref name=politika/>\n\nIn parallel, police closed many of the larger brothels due to public pressure. Police had the powers to forcibly register women they suspected, which could simply be women having relationships outside of marriage.\n\nA number of factors contributed to the growth of the sex trade in nineteenth century Poland, including increasing urbanisation, with growing cities and a population shift from the land to the towns and cities. The increasing feminisation of poverty was also a contributing factor. So prevalent was paid sex amongst domestic servants, that a 1913 regulation required them to register for medical exams as well. A second class was waitresses, and after 1906, they too were registered.\n\nAs the supply increased, so did the demand. 40% of Warsaw university students stated that their first sexual encounter was commercial, and estimates at the time suggested that over 80% of high school and university students bought sex. As throughout history, the military were a major source of demand, and because of concerns about venereal disease, authorities instituted regulations similar to those in the [[British Empire]] ([[Contagious Diseases Acts]]), requiring any young woman on her own to submit to examination.\n\n{{seealso|Alfonse Pogrom}}\n\nA great deal of attention began to be paid to prostitution during this period. This increased attention needs<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Stauter-Halsted|first1=Keely|title=Moral Panic and the Prostitute in Partitioned Poland: Middle-Class Respectability in Defense of the Modern Nation|journal=Slavic Review |volume=68|issue=3 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290923316 |accessdate=16 April 2018|pages=557\u2013581+ix|doi=10.1017/S0037677900019744|date=1 September 2009}}</ref> to be interpreted in the light of nineteenth century European attitudes to prostitution, where it was becoming the subject of almost daily discourse. A second wave of moral panic also swept Poland during the [[Second Republic of Poland|Second Republic]] (1918\u20131939). However what was often neglected was that Polish sex workers comprised a potentially upwardly mobile, economically ambitious lower class, that contributed significantly to Polish social and economic life.\n\nHousehold servants, nursemaids, and wet nurses were among those known to rely on commercial sex to supplement their low wages, while middle-class husbands and their adolescent sons became regular clientele. Unsavoury images of prostitution, such as [[Jack the Ripper]] ''\"Kuba rozpruwacz\"'' were imported from abroad.\n\nPhysicians sounded the alarm about a rise in syphilis rates, while the Roman Catholic Church, middle-class charities, and Jewish aid agencies set up societies to rescue \"fallen women\" from the wages of sin. Chastity or \"purity\" societies, and women's groups organized meetings and conferences. Feminists composed moral treatises and established international organizations to combat trafficking of women. \"[[White slavery (prostitution)|White slavery]]\" attracted much media attention as in other countries. However, the bulk of the concern related to the open display of solicitation in public places. Public discourse emphasised not only this deviant behaviour but also the victim role, trapped and in the hands of pimps and traffickers. These stories were mingled with [[antisemitism]], as the perpetrators (like infamous [[Zvi Migdal]]) were frequently depicted as [[Jewish]]. These scenes also appeared in the literature of the day, such as [[Bronislaw Szczygielski]]'s ''A Woman - A Body: The Odyssey of a Fallen Woman'' (Kobieta-Cialo: Odyseja kobiety upadlej, Warsaw, 1914).\n<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/pss/25621657 Moral Panic and the Prostitute in Partitioned Poland: Middle-Class Respectability in Defence of the Modern Nation.

Naturally separate institutions were required for officers, non-commissioned officers, and privates.\n<ref name=politika/>\n\n=== Second Republic (1918\u20131939) ===\nThe new Polish authorities were faced with a large number of problems arising from the recently ceased hostilitiies. One of the first acts of the newly reconstituted nation was the Basic Sanitation Law of July 1919 (Zasadnicza ustawa sanitarna). Under this law brothels were suppressed on 6 September 1922, while setting up a system of supervision of independent workers. A maximum of two workers were allowed in any house.\n<ref name=politika/>\n\nThe State brought many cases of prosecution against organised prostitution and pimps during this period.\n\n=== Postwar period (People's Republic 1945-1989) ===\nUnder the post [[Second World War]] [[communist]] [[People's Republic of Poland|regime]] prostitution did not exist officially but was nevertheless widespread. People who extorted sex workers could be prosecuted though.\n<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,907175,00.html|title=POLAND: The Hard-Currency Girls|journal=Time|date=7 May 1973|via=www.time.com}}</ref>\n\nIt was a maxim of Marxism, that prostitution would disappear in a socialist society with equality of means.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wattpad.com/349431?p=1|title=Marek Karpi\u0144ski: Najstarszy zaw\u00f3d \u015bwiata. Historia prostytucji. London: Lemur (Puls Publications Ltd), 1997}}</ref>\nThe main centres were hotels and restaurants and the main clients westerners. As such prostitution formed an important source of hard currency. Despite this the Republic's special services were actually running hotel rings. In this way they could obtain information about foreigners, compromise and extort people.\n\n==== 1945-1948 ====\nIn the initial years (1945 - 1948) there was a registration scheme, and special sections were set up to deal with \"enemies of morality\" (''wrogami moralno\u015bci''), but this was abolished when other priorities engaged the State. 1948-1952 saw forced labor camps. Despite continued efforts to eradicate prostitution, many elements of centrally-planned socialism actually contributed to it, such as the 'Great Socialist Construction' (''wielkie budowy socjalizmu'') which saw migration of large numbers of men. A memo from the Secretariat of the Party Central Committee (including [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]] who was then Secretary General), dated 23 November 1955, states that in 1949 there were 4,000 sex workers in Poland, in 1954 1,700 and that 6,000 had been arrested. It also refers to the difficulties in the struggle to abolish the practice. It refers to the prewar period when \"prostitution not only was not a crime,\nbut on the contrary - officially recognized and protected by the state\". Data from the Ministry of the Interior, dated 9 February 1957 refer to 1,500 workers in the six major cities.\n\n==== 1960-1983 ====\nThe period from the 1960s saw a slight ideological \"thaw\" that culminated in the fall of the [[iron curtain]] (\u017belazna kurtyna) in 1989. Changes in Polish society included increasing tourism and trade with the West, acceptability of foreign currency and an expanding hotel business, all factors conducive to the growth of the sex trade. Although liable to a large error margin, estimates of the numbers of sex workers were 7,267 in 1962, and 9847 in 1969. Sometimes referred to as \"Servants of Venus\" (S\u0142u\u017cebnice Wenery), sex workers started to become one of the higher income earning groups. Venues included market towns, port cities, hotels and environs and around railway stations. Well known areas for the less wealthy included the East Side and cafes along [[Aleje Jerozolimskie]] as well as the famous ''Pigalak'' area in [[Warsaw]].\n\nThis period was notable for a criminal case involving the porters at the [[Hotel Europejski]] who were living off the trade they supplied. However these prosecutions were the exception in a trade largely opaque to the authorities and an important part of the economy. A single client could net a sex worker the equivalent of an average monthly wage, and some could make the same as corporate executives. Both workers and clients benefited - for instance a US10 fee for a \"short service\" was very affordable for foreign visitors, and only 20% of prices in West Germany.\n\n==== Martial Law (1981\u20131983) and the liberalisation of the 80s ====\nThe [[Martial law in Poland|martial law]] (Stan wojenny) period was a difficult time for sex workers, but quickly gave way to a more liberal period. However the [[AIDS]] epidemic also reduced demand for paid sex. This was partly offset by the reduction in [[Censorship in the People's Republic of Poland|censorship]], allowing newspaper advertising, for instance in ''Kurier Polski''. This period also saw the arrival of escort businesses.\n\n==== Research ====\nBecause of ideological reasons, there was very little research done during this time, other in forensic literature,\n<ref>Antoniszyn M., Marek A.: Prostytucja w \u015bwietle bada\u0144 kryminologicznych. Warszawa 1985.</ref>\nat least until the 90s. Examples include Pawlik's study of [[Cracow]] prostitutes (1991)\n<ref>I. Pawlik: Krakowskie prostytutki. Dworc\u00f3wki, arabeski, makaroniary.

Escort agencies, erotic massage salons, porn movie\ntheaters and sex shops appeared very soon. Escort agencies are registered businesses, and circumvent laws.

Poland has become a transit country for sex workers from [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]], while the biggest group of sex workers in Poland is from  [[Ukraine]]. The number and proportion of migrant sex workers varies by region. Poland is still primarily a country of origin.<ref name=tampep09>[http://tampep.eu/documents/TAMPEP%202009%20European%20Mapping%20Report.pdf Sex Work in Europe.

Mark X may share elements of spelling or style that would lead a reasonable observer to believe the trademarks were related. \n\nFor example, in the computer industry, [[Microsoft]] has become such a well known [[trade name]] and trade mark that other businesses in the industry may want to use the term \"micro\" or \"soft\" in their names. As Microsoft generally does not hold [[exclusive right]]s in these terms, it would need to establish that any trade names or trademarks which include these terms is confusingly similar to \"Microsoft\". The reputation attaching to a trademark is also significant, such that \"Microsafe\" or \"Micro Software\", although clearly not identical, could potentially be confusingly similar and amount to an infringement.\n\nIn addition, the style of a trade mark, such as a [[logo]] or [[typeface|font]], can become relevant.  For example, Microsoft products are distinguished in the marketplace by a consistent font.  Competitors may not use the same font on their product, particularly when using a name which would not be confusingly similar except for the use of the font.  For example, a brand called \"Microsystems\" would most likely not be confused with Microsoft. However if Microsystems used the same font as Microsoft, it would be confusingly similar. Some styles, like the script used on [[Coca-Cola]] products, are so well known that even a completely different name in a similar script could be held to be confusingly similar.\n\nCases of this type can be proven by using [[statistical survey|surveys]] which show that members of the public who are likely to use the services or goods protected by the trade mark have been confused by it.  However, courts can also take [[judicial notice]] that an infringing mark is confusingly similar if it is obvious to even a casual observer.\n\n==In election law==\nThere are examples of [[electoral]] confusion caused by would-be candidates deliberately choosing similar names to confuse the electorate, hence potentially affecting the outcome of an election. For example, in three instances in the [[United Kingdom]] during 1994\u20135: a candidate attempting to stand as a member of the 'Literal Democrat' party (in the UK there is a [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democratic Party]]), and two instances of candidates standing for the 'Conservatory' party and the 'Conversative' party (against the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] candidate).

Because we find that the district court erred in finding that the University had sufficient evidence of present effects of past discrimination to justify the program and in finding that the program is narrowly tailored to serve its stated objectives, we reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment to the University. We further reverse the district court's denial of Podberesky's motion for summary judgment, and we remand for entry of judgment in favor of Podberesky.<br />The facts and prior proceedings in this case are set forth at length in our earlier opinion, Podberesky v. Kirwan, 956 F.2d 52 (4th Cir.1992) (Podberesky I). In sum, Daniel Podberesky challenges the University of Maryland's Banneker scholarship program, which is a merit-based program for which only African-American students are eligible. The University maintains a separate merit-based scholarship program, the Francis Scott Key program, which is not restricted to African-American students. Podberesky is Hispanic; he was therefore ineligible for consideration under the Banneker Program, although he met the academic and all other requirements for consideration. Podberesky was ineligible for consideration under the Key program because his academic credentials fell just shy of its more rigorous standards. ....}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nThe names of several awards commemorate Banneker.

Because we find that the district court erred in finding that the University had sufficient evidence of present effects of past discrimination to justify the program and in finding that the program is narrowly tailored to serve its stated objectives, we reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment to the University. We further reverse the district court's denial of Podberesky's motion for summary judgment, and we remand for entry of judgment in favor of Podberesky.<br />The facts and prior proceedings in this case are set forth at length in our earlier opinion, Podberesky v. Kirwan, 956 F.2d 52 (4th Cir.1992) (Podberesky I). In sum, Daniel Podberesky challenges the University of Maryland's Banneker scholarship program, which is a merit-based program for which only African-American students are eligible. The University maintains a separate merit-based scholarship program, the Francis Scott Key program, which is not restricted to African-American students. Podberesky is Hispanic; he was therefore ineligible for consideration under the Banneker Program, although he met the academic and all other requirements for consideration. Podberesky was ineligible for consideration under the Key program because his academic credentials fell just shy of its more rigorous standards. ....}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nThe names of several awards commemorate Banneker.

for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations?

for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''Cleveland.com'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |work=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

In 1877 they were prosecuted for publishing a book by birth control campaigner [[Charles Knowlton]]. The scandal made them famous, and Bradlaugh was subsequently elected [[Member of Parliament|M.P.]] for Northampton in 1880.\n\nThereafter, she became involved with union actions, including the [[Bloody Sunday (1887)|Bloody Sunday]] demonstration and the [[London matchgirls strike of 1888]]. She was a leading speaker for both the [[Fabian Society]] and the [[Marxist]] [[Social Democratic Federation]] (SDF). She was also elected to the [[London School Board]] for [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]], topping the poll, even though few women were qualified to vote at that time.\n\nIn 1890 Besant met [[Helena Blavatsky]], and over the next few years her interest in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] grew, whilst her interest in secular matters waned. She became a member of the [[Theosophical Society]] and a prominent lecturer on the subject. As part of her theosophy-related work, she travelled to India. In 1898 she helped establish the [[Central Hindu College|Central Hindu School]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ncert|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> and in 1922 she helped establish the [[Hyderabad (Sind) National Collegiate Board]] in [[Mumbai]], India.<ref>{{cite web|title=History and Development of the Board |url=http://www.hsncb.com/about-us/default.htm |website= Hyderabad (Sind) National Collegiate Board |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924220053/http://hsncb.com/about-us/default.htm |archivedate=24 September 2013 }}</ref> In 1902, she established the first overseas Lodge of the International Order of Co-Freemasonry, ''[[Le Droit Humain]]''. Over the next few years she established lodges in many parts of the [[British Empire]]. In 1907 she became president of the [[Theosophical Society]], whose international headquarters were, by then, located in [[Adyar (Chennai)|Adyar]], [[Madras]], ([[Chennai]]).\n\nShe also became involved in politics in India, joining the [[Indian National Congress]]. When [[World War I]] broke out in 1914, she helped launch the [[Indian Home Rule Movement|Home Rule League]] to campaign for democracy in India, and dominion status within the British Empire. This led to her election as president of the Indian National Congress, in late 1917. In the late 1920s, Besant travelled to the United States with her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and adopted son [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], who she claimed was the new Messiah and incarnation of Buddha. Krishnamurti rejected these claims in 1929.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/besant_annie.shtml \"Annie Besant (1847\u20131933)\" BBC UK Archive]</ref> After the war, she continued to campaign for Indian independence and for the causes of theosophy, until her death in 1933.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Sibsey church tower.JPG|left|thumb|St. Margaret's church, Sibsey, where Frank Besant was vicar, 1871\u20131917]]\nAnnie Wood was born in 1847 in [[London]] into an upper middle-class family. She was the daughter of William Burton Persse Wood (1816-1852) and Emily Roche Morris (died 1874). The Woods originated from [[Devon]] and her great-uncle was the Whig politician [[Sir Matthew Wood, 1st Baronet]] from whom derives the [[Page Wood baronets]]. Her father was an [[Englishman]] who lived in [[Dublin]] and attained a medical degree, having attended [[Trinity College Dublin]]. Her mother was an [[Irish Catholic]], from a family of more modest means. Besant would go on to make much of her Irish ancestry and supported the cause of Irish [[self-rule]] throughout her adult life. Her cousin [[Katharine O'Shea|Kitty O'Shea]] (born Katharine Wood) was noted for having an affair with [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], leading to his downfall. Her father died when she was five years old, leaving the family almost penniless. Her mother supported the family by running a boarding house for boys at [[Harrow School]]. However, she was unable to support Annie and persuaded her friend Ellen Marryat to care for her. Marryat made sure that she had a good education.  Annie was given a strong sense of duty to society and an equally strong sense of what independent women could achieve.<ref name=\"0-www.oxforddnb.com.librarycatalog.vts.edu\">Anne Taylor, 'Besant, Annie (1847\u20131933)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [http://0-www.oxforddnb.com.librarycatalog.vts.edu/view/article/30735, accessed 30 March 2015.]</ref> As a young woman, she was also able to travel widely in Europe. There she acquired a taste for [[Roman Catholic]] colour and ceremony that never left her.\n\nIn 1867, at age twenty, she married 26-year-old clergyman Frank Besant (1840\u20131917), younger brother of [[Walter Besant]]. He was an evangelical [[Anglican]] who seemed to share many of her concerns.<ref name=\"0-www.oxforddnb.com.librarycatalog.vts.edu\"/> On the eve of her marriage, she had become more politicised through a visit to friends in Manchester, who brought her into contact with both English radicals and the [[Manchester Martyrs]] of the Irish Republican [[Fenian Brotherhood]],<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/2/0/8/12085/12085-h/12085-h.htm#CHIV Annie Besant: An Autobiography, London, 1885, chapter 4.]</ref> as well as with the conditions of the urban poor.\n[[File:Annie Besant 1.jpg|thumb|Annie Besant]]\n[[File:Sibsey Besant grave.JPG|right|thumb|Grave of Frank Besant at Sibsey, where he remained vicar until his death]]\nSoon Frank became vicar of [[Sibsey]] in Lincolnshire. Annie moved to Sibsey with her husband, and within a few years they had two children, Arthur and Mabel; however, the marriage was a disaster. As Annie wrote in her ''Autobiography'', \"we were an ill-matched pair\".<ref>''Annie Besant: an Autobiography'' (Unwin, 1908), 81.</ref> The first conflict came over money and Annie's independence. Annie wrote short stories, books for children, and articles. As married women did not have the legal right to own property, Frank was able to collect all the money she earned. Politics further divided the couple. Annie began to support farm workers who were fighting to unionise and to win better conditions. Frank was a [[Tory]] and sided with the landlords and farmers. The tension came to a head when Annie refused to attend [[Eucharist|Communion]]. In 1873 she left him and returned to London. They were legally separated and Annie took her daughter with her.\n\nBesant began to question her own faith. She turned to leading churchmen for advice, going to see [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]], one of the leaders of the [[Oxford Movement]] within the [[Church of England]]. When she asked him to recommend books that would answer her questions, he told her she had read too many already.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/2/0/8/12085/12085-h/12085-h.htm#CHV Annie Besant: An Autobiography, London, 1885, chapter 5.]</ref> Besant returned to Frank to make a last unsuccessful effort to repair the marriage. She finally left for London.\n\n==Birkbeck==\nIn the late 1880s she studied at the [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck Literary and Scientific Institution]],<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Birkbeck, University of London |url=http://www.bbk.ac.uk/about-us/notable-birkbeckians | title = Notable Birkbeckians |accessdate=19 May 2017 }}</ref> where her religious and political activities caused alarm.

She was a leading member of the [[National Secular Society]] alongside [[Charles Bradlaugh]] and the [[South Place Ethical Society]].<ref>MacKillop, I. D. (1986) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mqgsFS_MN9UC&pgis=1 The British Ethical Societies]'', Cambridge University Press (Accessed 13 May 2014).</ref>\n\nDivorce was unthinkable for Frank, and was not really within the reach of even middle-class people. Annie was to remain Mrs Besant for the rest of her life. At first, she was able to keep contact with both children and to have Mabel live with her; she also got a small allowance from her husband.\n\nOnce free of Frank Besant and exposed to new currents of thought, she began to question not only her long-held religious beliefs but also the whole of conventional thinking. She began to write attacks on the churches and the way they controlled people's lives. In particular she attacked the status of the [[Church of England]] as a state-sponsored faith.\n\nSoon she was earning a small weekly wage by writing a column for the ''[[National Reformer]]'', the newspaper of the NSS. The NSS argued for a secular state and an end to the special status of Christianity, and allowed her to act as one of its public speakers. Public lectures were very popular entertainment in [[Victorian Era|Victorian]] times. Besant was a brilliant speaker, and was soon in great demand. Using the railway, she criss-crossed the country, speaking on all of the most important issues of the day, always demanding improvement, reform and freedom.\n\nFor many years Besant was a friend of the National Secular Society's leader, [[Charles Bradlaugh]]. Bradlaugh, a former soldier, had long been separated from his wife; Besant lived with him and his daughters, and they worked together on many projects. He was an [[atheist]] and a republican; he was also trying to get elected as [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Northampton]].\n\nBesant and Bradlaugh became household names in 1877 when they published ''[[Fruits of Philosophy]]'', a book by the American birth-control campaigner [[Charles Knowlton]]. It claimed that working-class families could never be happy until they were able to decide how many children they wanted. It also suggested ways to limit the size of their families.<ref>{{cite book | last = Knowlton | first = Charles | editor-last1 = Besant | editor-first1 = Annie | editor-last2 = Bradlaugh| editor-first2 = Charles | author-link = Charles Knowlton | editor-link2 = Charles Bradlaugh | title = Fruits of philosophy: a treatise on the population question | publisher = Reader's Library | location = San Francisco | date = October 1891 | origyear = 1840 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38185/38185-h/38185-h.htm | oclc = 626706770}} A publication about birth control. [https://archive.org/details/fruitsphilosoph00knogoog View original copy.]</ref> The Knowlton book was highly controversial, and was vigorously opposed by the Church. Besant and Bradlaugh proclaimed in the ''National Reformer'':\n\n<blockquote>We intend to publish nothing we do not think we can morally defend. All that we publish we shall defend.<ref>{{cite book |author=Annie Besant |title=Autobiographical sketches |url=https://archive.org/details/b28977245 |publisher=Freethought Publishing |date=1885 |page=[https://archive.org/details/b28977245/page/116 116] |ol=26315876M }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe pair were arrested and put on trial for publishing the Knowlton book. They were found guilty, but released pending appeal. As well as great opposition, Besant and Bradlaugh also received a great deal of support in the Liberal press. Arguments raged back and forth in the letters and comment columns as well as in the courtroom. Besant was instrumental in founding the [[Malthusian League]] during the trial, which would go on to advocate for the abolition of penalties for the promotion of contraception.<ref>{{cite journal |jstor=2173367 |title=The Malthusian League and resistance to birth control propaganda in late Victorian Britain | doi = 10.1080/00324728.1977.10412759 |journal=Population Studies |author=F. D'arcy |volume= 31| issue = 3|date= Nov 1977 |pages=429\u2013448}}</ref> For a time, it looked as though they would be sent to prison. The case was thrown out finally only on a technical point, the charges not having been properly drawn up.\n\nThe scandal cost Besant custody of her children. Her husband was able to persuade the court that she was unfit to look after them, and they were handed over to him permanently.\n\nOn 6 March 1881 she spoke at the opening of [[Leicester Secular Society]]'s new [[Leicester Secular Hall|Secular Hall]] in Humberstone Gate, Leicester. The other speakers were [[George Jacob Holyoake]], [[Harriet Law]] and [[Charles Bradlaugh]].<ref>[http://leicestersecularsociety.org.uk/history_gimson.htm#%281%29 Gimson 1932]</ref>\n\nBradlaugh's political prospects were not damaged by the Knowlton scandal and he was elected to Parliament in 1881. Because of his atheism, he asked to be allowed to affirm rather than swear the oath of loyalty. When the possibility of affirmation was refused, Bradlaugh stated his willingness to take the oath. But this option was also challenged. Although many Christians were shocked by Bradlaugh, others (like the Liberal leader [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]) spoke up for freedom of belief. It took more than six years before the matter was completely resolved (in Bradlaugh's favour) after a series of by-elections and court appearances.\n\nMeanwhile, Besant built close contacts with the [[Devolution#Irish home rule|Irish Home Rulers]] and supported them in her newspaper columns during what are considered crucial years, when the Irish nationalists were forming an alliance with Liberals and Radicals. Besant met the leaders of the Irish home rule movement. In particular, she got to know [[Michael Davitt]], who wanted to mobilise the Irish peasantry through a Land War, a direct struggle against the landowners. She spoke and wrote in favour of Davitt and his Land League many times over the coming decades.\n\nHowever, Bradlaugh's parliamentary work gradually alienated Besant. Women had no part in parliamentary politics. Besant was searching for a real political outlet, where her skills as a speaker, writer and organiser could do some real good.\n\nIn 1893, she was the representative of The Theosophical Society at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago. The World Parliament is famous in India because of Indian monk [[Swami Vivekanand]] addressed in the same event and which has received global recognition.\n\nIn 1895, together with the founder-president of the Theosophical Society, [[Henry Steel Olcott]], as well as [[Marie Musaeus Higgins]] and [[Peter De Abrew]], she was instrumental in developing the Buddhist school, [[Musaeus College]], in Colombo in the island Sri Lanka.\n\n==Political activism==\nFor Besant, politics, friendship and love were always closely intertwined. Her decision in favour of Socialism came about through a close relationship with [[George Bernard Shaw]], a struggling young Irish author living in London, and a leading light of the [[Fabian Society]] who considered Besant to be \"The greatest orator in England\". Annie was impressed by his work and grew very close to him too in the early 1880s. It was Besant who made the first move, by inviting Shaw to live with her. This he refused, but it was Shaw who sponsored Besant to join the [[Fabian Society]]. In its early days, the society was a gathering of people exploring spiritual, rather than political, [[criticism of capitalism|alternatives to the capitalist system]].<ref>[[Edward R. Pease]], ''The History of the Fabian Society'' (E. P. Dutton, 1916, rpt Aware Journalism, 2014), 62.</ref> Besant began to write for the Fabians. This new commitment \u2013 and her relationship with Shaw \u2013 deepened the split between Besant and Bradlaugh, who was an individualist and opposed to Socialism of any sort. While he defended free speech at any cost, he was very cautious about encouraging working-class militancy.<ref>Theresa Notare, ''A Revolution in Christian Morals: Lambeth 1930-Resolution #15. History and Reception'' (ProQuest, 2008), 188.</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://tribunemag.co.uk/2019/10/the-socialist-roots-of-birth-control | title=The Socialist Roots of Birth Control}}</ref>\n\nUnemployment was a central issue of the time, and in 1887 some of the London unemployed started to hold protests in [[Trafalgar Square]]. Besant agreed to appear as a speaker at a meeting on 13 November. The police tried to stop the assembly, fighting broke out, and troops were called. Many were hurt, one man died, and hundreds were arrested; Besant offered herself for arrest, an offer disregarded by the police.<ref>Sally Peters, ''Bernard Shaw: The Ascent of the Superman'' (Yale University, 1996), 94.</ref>\n\nThe events created a great sensation, and became known as [[Bloody Sunday (1887)|Bloody Sunday]]. Besant was widely blamed \u2013 or credited \u2013 for it. She threw herself into organising legal aid for the jailed workers and support for their families.<ref>Kumar, Raj, ''Annie Besant's Rise to Power in Indian Politics, 1914\u20131917'' (Concept Publishing, 1981), 36.</ref> Bradlaugh finally broke with her because he felt she should have asked his advice before going ahead with the meeting.\n\nAnother activity in this period was her involvement in the [[London matchgirls strike of 1888]]. She was drawn into this battle of the \"New Unionism\" by a young socialist, [[Herbert Burrows]]. He had made contact with workers at [[Bryant and May]]'s match factory in [[Bow, London]], who were mainly young women and were very poorly paid. They were also prey to industrial illnesses, like the bone-rotting [[Phossy jaw]], which was caused by the chemicals used in match manufacture.<ref>[http://www.mernick.org.uk/thhol/thelink.html \"White slavery in London\"] The Link, Issue no. 21 (via Tower Hamlets' Local History Library and Archives)</ref> Some of the match workers asked for help from Burrows and Besant in setting up a union.\n\nBesant met the women and set up a committee, which led the women into a strike for better pay and conditions, an action that won public support. Besant led demonstrations by \"match-girls\", who were cheered in the streets, and prominent churchmen wrote in their support. In just over a week they forced the firm to improve pay and conditions. Besant then helped them to set up a proper union and a social centre.\n\nAt the time, the matchstick industry was a very powerful lobby, since electric light was not yet widely available, and matches were an essential commodity; in 1872, lobbyists from the match industry had persuaded the British government to change its planned tax policy. Besant's campaign was the first time anyone had successfully challenged the match manufacturers on a major issue, and was seen as a landmark victory of the early years of British Socialism.\n\nDuring 1884, Besant had developed a very close friendship with [[Edward Aveling]], a young socialist teacher who lived in her house for a time. Aveling was a scholarly figure and it was he who first translated the important works of Marx into English. He eventually went to live with [[Eleanor Marx]], daughter of [[Karl Marx]]. Aveling was a great influence on Besant's thinking and she supported his work, yet she moved towards the rival Fabians at that time. Aveling and Eleanor Marx had joined the Marxist [[Social Democratic Federation]] and then the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]], a small Marxist splinter group which formed around the artist [[William Morris]].\n\nIt seems that Morris played a large part in converting Besant to Marxism, but it was to the SDF, not his Socialist League, that she turned in 1888. She remained a member for a number of years and became one of its best speakers. She was still a member of the Fabian Society; neither she nor anyone else seemed to think the two movements incompatible at the time.\n\nSoon after joining the Marxists, Besant was elected to the [[London School Board]] in 1888.<ref>[[Edward R. Pease]], ''The History of the Fabian Society'' (E. P. Dutton, 1916, rpt Aware Journalism, 2014), 179.</ref> Women at that time were not able to take part in parliamentary politics, but had been brought into the local electorate in 1881.\n\nBesant drove about with a red ribbon in her hair, speaking at meetings. \"No more hungry children\", her manifesto proclaimed. She combined her socialist principles with feminism:\n\"I ask the electors to vote for me, and the non-electors to work for me because women are wanted on the Board and there are too few women candidates.\" Besant came out on top of the poll in [[Tower Hamlets (UK Parliament constituency)|Tower Hamlets]], with over 15,000 votes. She wrote in the National Reformer: \"Ten years ago, under a cruel law, Christian bigotry robbed me of my little child. Now the care of the 763,680 children of London is placed partly in my hands.\"<ref>Jyoti Chandra, ''Annie Besant: from theosophy to nationalism'' (K.K. Publications, 2001), 17.</ref>\n\nBesant was also involved in the [[London dock strike of 1889]], in which the dockers, who were employed by the day, were led by [[Ben Tillett]] in a struggle for the \"Dockers' Tanner\". Besant helped Tillett draw up the union's rules and played an important part in the meetings and agitation which built up the organisation. She spoke for the dockers at public meetings and on street corners. Like the match-girls, the dockers won public support for their struggle, and the strike was won.<ref>Margaret Cole, ''The Story of Fabian Socialism'' (Stanford University, 1961), 34.</ref>\n\n==Theosophy==\nBesant was a prolific writer and a powerful orator.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Mark Bevir, ''The Making of British Socialism'' (Princeton University, 2011 ), 202.</ref> In 1889, she was asked to write a review for the ''Pall Mall Gazette''<ref>Lutyens, ''Krishnamurti: The Years of Awakening'', Avon/Discus. 1983. p 13</ref> on ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'', a book by [[H. P. Blavatsky]]. After reading it, she sought an interview with its author, meeting Blavatsky in Paris. In this way she was converted to Theosophy. Besant's intellectual journey had always involved a spiritual dimension, a quest for transformation of the whole person. As her interest in theosophy deepened, she allowed her membership of the Fabian Society to lapse (1890) and broke her links with the [[Marxists]]. In her ''Autobiography'', Besant follows her chapter on \"Socialism\" with \"Through Storm to Peace\", the peace of Theosophy. In 1888, she described herself as \"marching toward the Theosophy\" that would be the \"glory\" of her life. Besant had found the economic side of life lacking a spiritual dimension, so she searched for a belief based on \"Love\". She found this in Theosophy, so she joined the Theosophical Society, a move that distanced her from Bradlaugh and other former activist co-workers.<ref>Annie Besant, ''Annie Besant: an Autobiography'' (Unwin 1908), 330, 338, 340, 344, 357.</ref> When Blavatsky died in 1891, Besant was left as one of the leading figures in theosophy and in 1893 she represented it at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World Fair]].<ref>Emmett A. Greenwalt, ''The Point Loma Community in California, 1897\u20131942: A Theosophical Experiment'' (University of California, 1955), 10.</ref>\n\nIn 1893, soon after becoming a member of the Theosophical Society she went to India for the first time.<ref>Kumari Jayawardena, ''The White Woman's Other Burden'' (Routledge, 1995, 62.</ref> After a [[Theosophical Society#Schisms|dispute]] the American section split away into an independent organisation. The original society, then led by [[Henry Steel Olcott]] and Besant, is today based in [[Chennai]], India, and is known as the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]]. Following the split Besant devoted much of her energy not only to the society, but also to India's freedom and progress. [[Besant Nagar]], a neighbourhood near the Theosophical Society in Chennai, is named in her honour.\n\n===Co-freemasonry===\nBesant saw freemasonry, in particular [[Co-Freemasonry]], as an extension of her interest in the rights of women and the greater brotherhood of man and saw co-freemasonry as a \"movement which practised true brotherhood, in which women and men worked side by side for the perfecting of humanity. She immediately wanted to be admitted to this organisation\", known now as the ''International Order of Freemasonry for Men and Women, \"Le Droit Humain\".''\n\nThe link was made in 1902 by the theosophist Francesca Arundale, who accompanied Besant to Paris, along with six friends. \"They were all initiated, passed and raised into the first three degrees and Annie returned to England, bearing a Charter and founded there the first Lodge of International Mixed Masonry, Le Droit Humain.\" Besant eventually became the Order's Most Puissant Grand Commander, and was a major influence in the international growth of the Order.<ref>The International Bulletin, 20 September 1933, The International Order of Co-Freemasonry, Le Droit Humain. \"In a very short time, Sister Besant founded new lodges: three in London, three in the south of England, three in the North and North-West; she even organised one in Scotland. Travelling in 1904 with her sisters and brothers she met in the Netherlands, other brethren of a male obedience, who, being interested, collaborated in the further expansion of Le Droit Humain. Annie continued to work with such ardour that soon new lodges were formed Great Britain, South America, Canada, India, Ceylon, Australia and New Zealand. The lodges in all these countries were united under the name of the British Federation.\"</ref>\n\n===President of Theosophical Society===\n[[File:Olcott Besant Leadbeater.jpg|thumb|Annie Besant with [[Henry Olcott]] (left) and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|Charles Leadbeater]] (right) in [[Adyar (Chennai)|Adyar]], Madras in December 1905]]\nBesant met fellow theosophist [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] in London in April 1894. They became close co-workers in the theosophical movement and would remain so for the rest of their lives. Leadbeater claimed [[clairvoyance]] and reputedly helped Besant become clairvoyant herself in the following year. In a letter dated 25 August 1895 to Francisca Arundale, Leadbeater narrates how Besant became clairvoyant. Together they clairvoyantly investigated the universe, matter, thought-forms, and the history of mankind, and co-authored a book called ''[[Occult Chemistry]]''.\n\nIn 1906 Leadbeater became the centre of controversy when it emerged that he had advised the practice of masturbation to some boys under his care and spiritual instruction. Leadbeater stated he had encouraged the practice to keep the boys celibate, which was considered a prerequisite for advancement on the spiritual path.<ref>[http://leadbeater.org/tillettcwlchap10.htm Charles Webster Leadbeater 1854\u20131934: A Biographical Study, by Gregory John Tillett, 2008] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703063510/http://leadbeater.org/tillettcwlchap10.htm |date=3 July 2017 }}.</ref> Because of the controversy, he offered to resign from the Theosophical Society in 1906, which was accepted. The next year Besant became president of the society and in 1908, with her express support, Leadbeater was readmitted to the society. Leadbeater went on to face accusations of improper relations with boys, but none of the accusations were ever proven and Besant never deserted him.<ref>Besant, Annie (2 June 1913). \"Naranian v. Besant\". [Letters to the Editor]. ''[[The Times]]'' (London). p. 7. {{ISSN|0140-0460}}.</ref>\n\nUntil Besant's presidency, the society had as one of its foci [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]] and the island of [[Sri Lanka]], where Henry Olcott did the majority of his useful work.<ref>Blavatsky and Olcott had become Buddhists in Sri Lanka, and promoted Buddhist revival on the subcontinent. See also: [[Maha Bodhi Society]].</ref> Under Besant's leadership there was more stress on the teachings of \"The Aryavarta\", as she called central India, as well as on esoteric Christianity.<ref>M. K. Singh, ''Encyclopaedia Of Indian War Of Independence (1857\u20131947)'' (Anmol Publications, 2009) 118.</ref>\n\nBesant set up a new school for boys, the [[Central Hindu College]] (CHC) at [[Banaras]] which was formed on underlying theosophical principles, and which counted many prominent theosophists in its staff and faculty. Its aim was to build a new leadership for India. The students spent 90 minutes a day in prayer and studied religious texts, but they also studied modern science. It took 3 years to raise the money for the CHC, most of which came from Indian princes.<ref>Kumari Jayawardena, ''The White Woman's Other Burden'' (Routledge, 1995), 128.</ref> In April 1911, Besant met Pandit [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] and they decided to unite their forces and work for a common Hindu University at Banaras. Besant and fellow trustees of the Central Hindu College also agreed to Government of India's precondition that the college should become a part of the new University. The [[Banaras Hindu University]] started functioning from 1 October 1917 with the Central Hindu College as its first constituent college.\n\nBlavatsky had stated in 1889 that the main purpose of establishing the society was to prepare humanity for the future reception of a \"torch-bearer of Truth\", an emissary of a hidden [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] that, according to theosophists, guides the evolution of mankind.<ref>[[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky, H.

It also started years of upheaval, and contributed to splits in the Theosophical Society and doctrinal schisms in theosophy. Following the discovery, Jiddu Krishnamurti and his younger brother Nityananda (\"Nitya\") were placed under the care of theosophists and Krishnamurti was extensively groomed for his future mission as the new vehicle for the \"World Teacher\". Besant soon became the boys' [[legal guardianship|legal guardian]] with the consent of their father, who was very poor and could not take care of them. However, his father later changed his mind and began a legal battle to regain the guardianship, against the will of the boys.<ref>Lutyens ch. 7.</ref> Early in their relationship, Krishnamurti and Besant had developed a very close bond and he considered her a surrogate mother \u2013 a role she happily accepted.

She encouraged Indian national consciousness, attacked [[Caste system in India|caste]] and child marriage, and worked effectively for Indian education.<ref name=\"Rosemary. 2004\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/alonealoneliveso00dinn|title=Alone! alone! : lives of some outsider women|last=Rosemary.|first=Dinnage|date=2004|publisher=New York Review Books|isbn=1590170695|location=New York|oclc=54047029}}</ref> Along with her theosophical activities, Besant continued to actively participate in political matters. She had joined the [[Indian National Congress]]. As the name suggested, this was originally a debating body, which met each year to consider resolutions on political issues. Mostly it demanded more of a say for middle-class Indians in British Indian government. It had not yet developed into a permanent mass movement with local organisation. About this time her co-worker Leadbeater moved to Sydney.\n\nIn 1914 [[World War I]] broke out, and Britain asked for the support of its Empire in the fight against Germany. Echoing an Irish nationalist slogan, Besant declared, \"England's need is India's opportunity\". As editor of the [[New India]] newspaper, she attacked the [[British Raj|colonial government]] of India and called for clear and decisive moves towards self-rule. As with Ireland, the government refused to discuss any changes while the war lasted.\n\n[[File:Annie Besant.001.jpg|thumb|Annie Besant in Sydney, 1922]]\nIn 1916 Besant launched the [[All India Home Rule League]] along with [[Lokmanya Tilak]], once again modelling demands for India on Irish nationalist practices. This was the first political party in India to have regime change as its main goal. Unlike the Congress itself, the League worked all year round. It built a structure of local branches, enabling it to mobilise demonstrations, public meetings and agitations. In June 1917 Besant was arrested and interned at a [[hill station]], where she defiantly flew a red and green flag.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/house-arrest-of-annie-besant-remembered/article19201976.ece|title=House arrest of Annie Besant remembered|last=|first=|date=2017-07-03|work=The Hindu|access-date=2019-07-10|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref> The Congress and the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] together threatened to launch protests if she were not set free; Besant's arrest had created a focus for protest.<ref>{{cite book|title=India through the ages|url=https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= [https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada/page/192 192]|editor=K.S.

Gandhi]] \u2013 one of those who had written to demand Besant's release. He was a lawyer who had returned from leading Asians in a peaceful struggle against racism in South Africa. [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], Gandhi's closest collaborator, had been educated by a theosophist tutor.\n\nThe new leadership was committed to action that was both militant and non-violent, but there were differences between them and Besant. Despite her past, she was not happy with their socialist leanings.

He wrote ''The Besant Pedigree'' (1930) and was director of the Theosophical bookstore in London. One of Arthur Digby's daughters was Sylvia Besant, who married [[Commander]] [[Clem Lewis (Commander)|Clem Lewis]] in the 1920s.

In 1877 they were prosecuted for publishing a book by birth control campaigner [[Charles Knowlton]]. The scandal made them famous, and Bradlaugh was subsequently elected [[Member of Parliament|M.P.]] for Northampton in 1880.\n\nThereafter, she became involved with union actions, including the [[Bloody Sunday (1887)|Bloody Sunday]] demonstration and the [[London matchgirls strike of 1888]]. She was a leading speaker for both the [[Fabian Society]] and the [[Marxist]] [[Social Democratic Federation]] (SDF).

When [[World War I]] broke out in 1914, she helped launch the [[Indian Home Rule Movement|Home Rule League]] to campaign for democracy in India, and dominion status within the British Empire. This led to her election as president of the Indian National Congress, in late 1917. In the late 1920s, Besant travelled to the United States with her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and adopted son [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], who she claimed was the new Messiah and incarnation of Buddha.

She was the daughter of William Burton Persse Wood (1816-1852) and Emily Roche Morris (died 1874). The Woods originated from [[Devon]] and her great-uncle was the Whig politician [[Sir Matthew Wood, 1st Baronet]] from whom derives the [[Page Wood baronets]]. Her father was an [[Englishman]] who lived in [[Dublin]] and attained a medical degree, having attended [[Trinity College Dublin]]. Her mother was an [[Irish Catholic]], from a family of more modest means. Besant would go on to make much of her Irish ancestry and supported the cause of Irish [[self-rule]] throughout her adult life. Her cousin [[Katharine O'Shea|Kitty O'Shea]] (born Katharine Wood) was noted for having an affair with [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], leading to his downfall. Her father died when she was five years old, leaving the family almost penniless. Her mother supported the family by running a boarding house for boys at [[Harrow School]]. However, she was unable to support Annie and persuaded her friend Ellen Marryat to care for her. Marryat made sure that she had a good education.  Annie was given a strong sense of duty to society and an equally strong sense of what independent women could achieve.<ref name=\"0-www.oxforddnb.com.librarycatalog.vts.edu\">Anne Taylor, 'Besant, Annie (1847\u20131933)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [http://0-www.oxforddnb.com.librarycatalog.vts.edu/view/article/30735, accessed 30 March 2015.]</ref> As a young woman, she was also able to travel widely in Europe. There she acquired a taste for [[Roman Catholic]] colour and ceremony that never left her.\n\nIn 1867, at age twenty, she married 26-year-old clergyman Frank Besant (1840\u20131917), younger brother of [[Walter Besant]]. He was an evangelical [[Anglican]] who seemed to share many of her concerns.<ref name=\"0-www.oxforddnb.com.librarycatalog.vts.edu\"/> On the eve of her marriage, she had become more politicised through a visit to friends in Manchester, who brought her into contact with both English radicals and the [[Manchester Martyrs]] of the Irish Republican [[Fenian Brotherhood]],<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/2/0/8/12085/12085-h/12085-h.htm#CHIV Annie Besant: An Autobiography, London, 1885, chapter 4.]</ref> as well as with the conditions of the urban poor.\n[[File:Annie Besant 1.jpg|thumb|Annie Besant]]\n[[File:Sibsey Besant grave.JPG|right|thumb|Grave of Frank Besant at Sibsey, where he remained vicar until his death]]\nSoon Frank became vicar of [[Sibsey]] in Lincolnshire. Annie moved to Sibsey with her husband, and within a few years they had two children, Arthur and Mabel; however, the marriage was a disaster. As Annie wrote in her ''Autobiography'', \"we were an ill-matched pair\".<ref>''Annie Besant: an Autobiography'' (Unwin, 1908), 81.</ref> The first conflict came over money and Annie's independence. Annie wrote short stories, books for children, and articles. As married women did not have the legal right to own property, Frank was able to collect all the money she earned. Politics further divided the couple. Annie began to support farm workers who were fighting to unionise and to win better conditions. Frank was a [[Tory]] and sided with the landlords and farmers. The tension came to a head when Annie refused to attend [[Eucharist|Communion]]. In 1873 she left him and returned to London. They were legally separated and Annie took her daughter with her.\n\nBesant began to question her own faith. She turned to leading churchmen for advice, going to see [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]], one of the leaders of the [[Oxford Movement]] within the [[Church of England]].

She finally left for London.\n\n==Birkbeck==\nIn the late 1880s she studied at the [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck Literary and Scientific Institution]],<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Birkbeck, University of London |url=http://www.bbk.ac.uk/about-us/notable-birkbeckians | title = Notable Birkbeckians |accessdate=19 May 2017 }}</ref> where her religious and political activities caused alarm.

She was a leading member of the [[National Secular Society]] alongside [[Charles Bradlaugh]] and the [[South Place Ethical Society]].<ref>MacKillop, I. D. (1986) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mqgsFS_MN9UC&pgis=1 The British Ethical Societies]'', Cambridge University Press (Accessed 13 May 2014).</ref>\n\nDivorce was unthinkable for Frank, and was not really within the reach of even middle-class people. Annie was to remain Mrs Besant for the rest of her life. At first, she was able to keep contact with both children and to have Mabel live with her; she also got a small allowance from her husband.\n\nOnce free of Frank Besant and exposed to new currents of thought, she began to question not only her long-held religious beliefs but also the whole of conventional thinking. She began to write attacks on the churches and the way they controlled people's lives. In particular she attacked the status of the [[Church of England]] as a state-sponsored faith.\n\nSoon she was earning a small weekly wage by writing a column for the ''[[National Reformer]]'', the newspaper of the NSS. The NSS argued for a secular state and an end to the special status of Christianity, and allowed her to act as one of its public speakers. Public lectures were very popular entertainment in [[Victorian Era|Victorian]] times. Besant was a brilliant speaker, and was soon in great demand. Using the railway, she criss-crossed the country, speaking on all of the most important issues of the day, always demanding improvement, reform and freedom.\n\nFor many years Besant was a friend of the National Secular Society's leader, [[Charles Bradlaugh]]. Bradlaugh, a former soldier, had long been separated from his wife; Besant lived with him and his daughters, and they worked together on many projects. He was an [[atheist]] and a republican; he was also trying to get elected as [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Northampton]].\n\nBesant and Bradlaugh became household names in 1877 when they published ''[[Fruits of Philosophy]]'', a book by the American birth-control campaigner [[Charles Knowlton]]. It claimed that working-class families could never be happy until they were able to decide how many children they wanted. It also suggested ways to limit the size of their families.<ref>{{cite book | last = Knowlton | first = Charles | editor-last1 = Besant | editor-first1 = Annie | editor-last2 = Bradlaugh| editor-first2 = Charles | author-link = Charles Knowlton | editor-link2 = Charles Bradlaugh | title = Fruits of philosophy: a treatise on the population question | publisher = Reader's Library | location = San Francisco | date = October 1891 | origyear = 1840 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38185/38185-h/38185-h.htm | oclc = 626706770}} A publication about birth control. [https://archive.org/details/fruitsphilosoph00knogoog View original copy.]</ref> The Knowlton book was highly controversial, and was vigorously opposed by the Church. Besant and Bradlaugh proclaimed in the ''National Reformer'':\n\n<blockquote>We intend to publish nothing we do not think we can morally defend. All that we publish we shall defend.<ref>{{cite book |author=Annie Besant |title=Autobiographical sketches |url=https://archive.org/details/b28977245 |publisher=Freethought Publishing |date=1885 |page=[https://archive.org/details/b28977245/page/116 116] |ol=26315876M }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe pair were arrested and put on trial for publishing the Knowlton book. They were found guilty, but released pending appeal. As well as great opposition, Besant and Bradlaugh also received a great deal of support in the Liberal press. Arguments raged back and forth in the letters and comment columns as well as in the courtroom. Besant was instrumental in founding the [[Malthusian League]] during the trial, which would go on to advocate for the abolition of penalties for the promotion of contraception.<ref>{{cite journal |jstor=2173367 |title=The Malthusian League and resistance to birth control propaganda in late Victorian Britain | doi = 10.1080/00324728.1977.10412759 |journal=Population Studies |author=F.

The case was thrown out finally only on a technical point, the charges not having been properly drawn up.\n\nThe scandal cost Besant custody of her children. Her husband was able to persuade the court that she was unfit to look after them, and they were handed over to him permanently.\n\nOn 6 March 1881 she spoke at the opening of [[Leicester Secular Society]]'s new [[Leicester Secular Hall|Secular Hall]] in Humberstone Gate, Leicester. The other speakers were [[George Jacob Holyoake]], [[Harriet Law]] and [[Charles Bradlaugh]].<ref>[http://leicestersecularsociety.org.uk/history_gimson.htm#%281%29 Gimson 1932]</ref>\n\nBradlaugh's political prospects were not damaged by the Knowlton scandal and he was elected to Parliament in 1881. Because of his atheism, he asked to be allowed to affirm rather than swear the oath of loyalty. When the possibility of affirmation was refused, Bradlaugh stated his willingness to take the oath. But this option was also challenged. Although many Christians were shocked by Bradlaugh, others (like the Liberal leader [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]) spoke up for freedom of belief. It took more than six years before the matter was completely resolved (in Bradlaugh's favour) after a series of by-elections and court appearances.\n\nMeanwhile, Besant built close contacts with the [[Devolution#Irish home rule|Irish Home Rulers]] and supported them in her newspaper columns during what are considered crucial years, when the Irish nationalists were forming an alliance with Liberals and Radicals. Besant met the leaders of the Irish home rule movement. In particular, she got to know [[Michael Davitt]], who wanted to mobilise the Irish peasantry through a Land War, a direct struggle against the landowners. She spoke and wrote in favour of Davitt and his Land League many times over the coming decades.\n\nHowever, Bradlaugh's parliamentary work gradually alienated Besant. Women had no part in parliamentary politics. Besant was searching for a real political outlet, where her skills as a speaker, writer and organiser could do some real good.\n\nIn 1893, she was the representative of The Theosophical Society at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago. The World Parliament is famous in India because of Indian monk [[Swami Vivekanand]] addressed in the same event and which has received global recognition.\n\nIn 1895, together with the founder-president of the Theosophical Society, [[Henry Steel Olcott]], as well as [[Marie Musaeus Higgins]] and [[Peter De Abrew]], she was instrumental in developing the Buddhist school, [[Musaeus College]], in Colombo in the island Sri Lanka.\n\n==Political activism==\nFor Besant, politics, friendship and love were always closely intertwined. Her decision in favour of Socialism came about through a close relationship with [[George Bernard Shaw]], a struggling young Irish author living in London, and a leading light of the [[Fabian Society]] who considered Besant to be \"The greatest orator in England\". Annie was impressed by his work and grew very close to him too in the early 1880s. It was Besant who made the first move, by inviting Shaw to live with her. This he refused, but it was Shaw who sponsored Besant to join the [[Fabian Society]]. In its early days, the society was a gathering of people exploring spiritual, rather than political, [[criticism of capitalism|alternatives to the capitalist system]].<ref>[[Edward R. Pease]], ''The History of the Fabian Society'' (E. P. Dutton, 1916, rpt Aware Journalism, 2014), 62.</ref> Besant began to write for the Fabians. This new commitment \u2013 and her relationship with Shaw \u2013 deepened the split between Besant and Bradlaugh, who was an individualist and opposed to Socialism of any sort. While he defended free speech at any cost, he was very cautious about encouraging working-class militancy.<ref>Theresa Notare, ''A Revolution in Christian Morals: Lambeth 1930-Resolution #15. History and Reception'' (ProQuest, 2008), 188.</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://tribunemag.co.uk/2019/10/the-socialist-roots-of-birth-control | title=The Socialist Roots of Birth Control}}</ref>\n\nUnemployment was a central issue of the time, and in 1887 some of the London unemployed started to hold protests in [[Trafalgar Square]]. Besant agreed to appear as a speaker at a meeting on 13 November. The police tried to stop the assembly, fighting broke out, and troops were called. Many were hurt, one man died, and hundreds were arrested; Besant offered herself for arrest, an offer disregarded by the police.<ref>Sally Peters, ''Bernard Shaw: The Ascent of the Superman'' (Yale University, 1996), 94.</ref>\n\nThe events created a great sensation, and became known as [[Bloody Sunday (1887)|Bloody Sunday]]. Besant was widely blamed \u2013 or credited \u2013 for it. She threw herself into organising legal aid for the jailed workers and support for their families.<ref>Kumar, Raj, ''Annie Besant's Rise to Power in Indian Politics, 1914\u20131917'' (Concept Publishing, 1981), 36.</ref> Bradlaugh finally broke with her because he felt she should have asked his advice before going ahead with the meeting.\n\nAnother activity in this period was her involvement in the [[London matchgirls strike of 1888]]. She was drawn into this battle of the \"New Unionism\" by a young socialist, [[Herbert Burrows]]. He had made contact with workers at [[Bryant and May]]'s match factory in [[Bow, London]], who were mainly young women and were very poorly paid. They were also prey to industrial illnesses, like the bone-rotting [[Phossy jaw]], which was caused by the chemicals used in match manufacture.<ref>[http://www.mernick.org.uk/thhol/thelink.html \"White slavery in London\"] The Link, Issue no. 21 (via Tower Hamlets' Local History Library and Archives)</ref> Some of the match workers asked for help from Burrows and Besant in setting up a union.\n\nBesant met the women and set up a committee, which led the women into a strike for better pay and conditions, an action that won public support. Besant led demonstrations by \"match-girls\", who were cheered in the streets, and prominent churchmen wrote in their support. In just over a week they forced the firm to improve pay and conditions. Besant then helped them to set up a proper union and a social centre.\n\nAt the time, the matchstick industry was a very powerful lobby, since electric light was not yet widely available, and matches were an essential commodity; in 1872, lobbyists from the match industry had persuaded the British government to change its planned tax policy. Besant's campaign was the first time anyone had successfully challenged the match manufacturers on a major issue, and was seen as a landmark victory of the early years of British Socialism.\n\nDuring 1884, Besant had developed a very close friendship with [[Edward Aveling]], a young socialist teacher who lived in her house for a time. Aveling was a scholarly figure and it was he who first translated the important works of Marx into English. He eventually went to live with [[Eleanor Marx]], daughter of [[Karl Marx]]. Aveling was a great influence on Besant's thinking and she supported his work, yet she moved towards the rival Fabians at that time. Aveling and Eleanor Marx had joined the Marxist [[Social Democratic Federation]] and then the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]], a small Marxist splinter group which formed around the artist [[William Morris]].\n\nIt seems that Morris played a large part in converting Besant to Marxism, but it was to the SDF, not his Socialist League, that she turned in 1888. She remained a member for a number of years and became one of its best speakers. She was still a member of the Fabian Society; neither she nor anyone else seemed to think the two movements incompatible at the time.\n\nSoon after joining the Marxists, Besant was elected to the [[London School Board]] in 1888.<ref>[[Edward R. Pease]], ''The History of the Fabian Society'' (E. P. Dutton, 1916, rpt Aware Journalism, 2014), 179.</ref> Women at that time were not able to take part in parliamentary politics, but had been brought into the local electorate in 1881.\n\nBesant drove about with a red ribbon in her hair, speaking at meetings. \"No more hungry children\", her manifesto proclaimed. She combined her socialist principles with feminism:\n\"I ask the electors to vote for me, and the non-electors to work for me because women are wanted on the Board and there are too few women candidates.\" Besant came out on top of the poll in [[Tower Hamlets (UK Parliament constituency)|Tower Hamlets]], with over 15,000 votes. She wrote in the National Reformer: \"Ten years ago, under a cruel law, Christian bigotry robbed me of my little child. Now the care of the 763,680 children of London is placed partly in my hands.\"<ref>Jyoti Chandra, ''Annie Besant: from theosophy to nationalism'' (K.K. Publications, 2001), 17.</ref>\n\nBesant was also involved in the [[London dock strike of 1889]], in which the dockers, who were employed by the day, were led by [[Ben Tillett]] in a struggle for the \"Dockers' Tanner\". Besant helped Tillett draw up the union's rules and played an important part in the meetings and agitation which built up the organisation. She spoke for the dockers at public meetings and on street corners. Like the match-girls, the dockers won public support for their struggle, and the strike was won.<ref>Margaret Cole, ''The Story of Fabian Socialism'' (Stanford University, 1961), 34.</ref>\n\n==Theosophy==\nBesant was a prolific writer and a powerful orator.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Mark Bevir, ''The Making of British Socialism'' (Princeton University, 2011 ), 202.</ref> In 1889, she was asked to write a review for the ''Pall Mall Gazette''<ref>Lutyens, ''Krishnamurti: The Years of Awakening'', Avon/Discus. 1983. p 13</ref> on ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'', a book by [[H. P. Blavatsky]]. After reading it, she sought an interview with its author, meeting Blavatsky in Paris. In this way she was converted to Theosophy. Besant's intellectual journey had always involved a spiritual dimension, a quest for transformation of the whole person. As her interest in theosophy deepened, she allowed her membership of the Fabian Society to lapse (1890) and broke her links with the [[Marxists]]. In her ''Autobiography'', Besant follows her chapter on \"Socialism\" with \"Through Storm to Peace\", the peace of Theosophy. In 1888, she described herself as \"marching toward the Theosophy\" that would be the \"glory\" of her life. Besant had found the economic side of life lacking a spiritual dimension, so she searched for a belief based on \"Love\". She found this in Theosophy, so she joined the Theosophical Society, a move that distanced her from Bradlaugh and other former activist co-workers.<ref>Annie Besant, ''Annie Besant: an Autobiography'' (Unwin 1908), 330, 338, 340, 344, 357.</ref> When Blavatsky died in 1891, Besant was left as one of the leading figures in theosophy and in 1893 she represented it at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World Fair]].<ref>Emmett A. Greenwalt, ''The Point Loma Community in California, 1897\u20131942: A Theosophical Experiment'' (University of California, 1955), 10.</ref>\n\nIn 1893, soon after becoming a member of the Theosophical Society she went to India for the first time.<ref>Kumari Jayawardena, ''The White Woman's Other Burden'' (Routledge, 1995, 62.</ref> After a [[Theosophical Society#Schisms|dispute]] the American section split away into an independent organisation. The original society, then led by [[Henry Steel Olcott]] and Besant, is today based in [[Chennai]], India, and is known as the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]]. Following the split Besant devoted much of her energy not only to the society, but also to India's freedom and progress. [[Besant Nagar]], a neighbourhood near the Theosophical Society in Chennai, is named in her honour.\n\n===Co-freemasonry===\nBesant saw freemasonry, in particular [[Co-Freemasonry]], as an extension of her interest in the rights of women and the greater brotherhood of man and saw co-freemasonry as a \"movement which practised true brotherhood, in which women and men worked side by side for the perfecting of humanity. She immediately wanted to be admitted to this organisation\", known now as the ''International Order of Freemasonry for Men and Women, \"Le Droit Humain\".''\n\nThe link was made in 1902 by the theosophist Francesca Arundale, who accompanied Besant to Paris, along with six friends. \"They were all initiated, passed and raised into the first three degrees and Annie returned to England, bearing a Charter and founded there the first Lodge of International Mixed Masonry, Le Droit Humain.\" Besant eventually became the Order's Most Puissant Grand Commander, and was a major influence in the international growth of the Order.<ref>The International Bulletin, 20 September 1933, The International Order of Co-Freemasonry, Le Droit Humain. \"In a very short time, Sister Besant founded new lodges: three in London, three in the south of England, three in the North and North-West; she even organised one in Scotland. Travelling in 1904 with her sisters and brothers she met in the Netherlands, other brethren of a male obedience, who, being interested, collaborated in the further expansion of Le Droit Humain. Annie continued to work with such ardour that soon new lodges were formed Great Britain, South America, Canada, India, Ceylon, Australia and New Zealand. The lodges in all these countries were united under the name of the British Federation.\"</ref>\n\n===President of Theosophical Society===\n[[File:Olcott Besant Leadbeater.jpg|thumb|Annie Besant with [[Henry Olcott]] (left) and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|Charles Leadbeater]] (right) in [[Adyar (Chennai)|Adyar]], Madras in December 1905]]\nBesant met fellow theosophist [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] in London in April 1894. They became close co-workers in the theosophical movement and would remain so for the rest of their lives. Leadbeater claimed [[clairvoyance]] and reputedly helped Besant become clairvoyant herself in the following year. In a letter dated 25 August 1895 to Francisca Arundale, Leadbeater narrates how Besant became clairvoyant. Together they clairvoyantly investigated the universe, matter, thought-forms, and the history of mankind, and co-authored a book called ''[[Occult Chemistry]]''.\n\nIn 1906 Leadbeater became the centre of controversy when it emerged that he had advised the practice of masturbation to some boys under his care and spiritual instruction. Leadbeater stated he had encouraged the practice to keep the boys celibate, which was considered a prerequisite for advancement on the spiritual path.<ref>[http://leadbeater.org/tillettcwlchap10.htm Charles Webster Leadbeater 1854\u20131934: A Biographical Study, by Gregory John Tillett, 2008] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703063510/http://leadbeater.org/tillettcwlchap10.htm |date=3 July 2017 }}.</ref> Because of the controversy, he offered to resign from the Theosophical Society in 1906, which was accepted. The next year Besant became president of the society and in 1908, with her express support, Leadbeater was readmitted to the society. Leadbeater went on to face accusations of improper relations with boys, but none of the accusations were ever proven and Besant never deserted him.<ref>Besant, Annie (2 June 1913). \"Naranian v. Besant\". [Letters to the Editor]. ''[[The Times]]'' (London). p. 7. {{ISSN|0140-0460}}.</ref>\n\nUntil Besant's presidency, the society had as one of its foci [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]] and the island of [[Sri Lanka]], where Henry Olcott did the majority of his useful work.<ref>Blavatsky and Olcott had become Buddhists in Sri Lanka, and promoted Buddhist revival on the subcontinent. See also: [[Maha Bodhi Society]].</ref> Under Besant's leadership there was more stress on the teachings of \"The Aryavarta\", as she called central India, as well as on esoteric Christianity.<ref>M. K. Singh, ''Encyclopaedia Of Indian War Of Independence (1857\u20131947)'' (Anmol Publications, 2009) 118.</ref>\n\nBesant set up a new school for boys, the [[Central Hindu College]] (CHC) at [[Banaras]] which was formed on underlying theosophical principles, and which counted many prominent theosophists in its staff and faculty. Its aim was to build a new leadership for India. The students spent 90 minutes a day in prayer and studied religious texts, but they also studied modern science. It took 3 years to raise the money for the CHC, most of which came from Indian princes.<ref>Kumari Jayawardena, ''The White Woman's Other Burden'' (Routledge, 1995), 128.</ref> In April 1911, Besant met Pandit [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] and they decided to unite their forces and work for a common Hindu University at Banaras. Besant and fellow trustees of the Central Hindu College also agreed to Government of India's precondition that the college should become a part of the new University. The [[Banaras Hindu University]] started functioning from 1 October 1917 with the Central Hindu College as its first constituent college.\n\nBlavatsky had stated in 1889 that the main purpose of establishing the society was to prepare humanity for the future reception of a \"torch-bearer of Truth\", an emissary of a hidden [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] that, according to theosophists, guides the evolution of mankind.<ref>[[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky, H.

It also started years of upheaval, and contributed to splits in the Theosophical Society and doctrinal schisms in theosophy. Following the discovery, Jiddu Krishnamurti and his younger brother Nityananda (\"Nitya\") were placed under the care of theosophists and Krishnamurti was extensively groomed for his future mission as the new vehicle for the \"World Teacher\". Besant soon became the boys' [[legal guardianship|legal guardian]] with the consent of their father, who was very poor and could not take care of them. However, his father later changed his mind and began a legal battle to regain the guardianship, against the will of the boys.<ref>Lutyens ch. 7.</ref> Early in their relationship, Krishnamurti and Besant had developed a very close bond and he considered her a surrogate mother \u2013 a role she happily accepted.

He dissolved the [[Order of the Star in the East]], an organisation founded to assist the World Teacher in his mission, and eventually left the [[Theosophical Society]] and theosophy at large.<ref>Lutyens pp. 276\u2013278, 285.</ref> He spent the rest of his life travelling the world as an unaffiliated speaker, becoming in the process widely known as an original, independent thinker on philosophical, psychological, and spiritual subjects.

She encouraged Indian national consciousness, attacked [[Caste system in India|caste]] and child marriage, and worked effectively for Indian education.<ref name=\"Rosemary. 2004\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/alonealoneliveso00dinn|title=Alone! alone! : lives of some outsider women|last=Rosemary.|first=Dinnage|date=2004|publisher=New York Review Books|isbn=1590170695|location=New York|oclc=54047029}}</ref> Along with her theosophical activities, Besant continued to actively participate in political matters. She had joined the [[Indian National Congress]]. As the name suggested, this was originally a debating body, which met each year to consider resolutions on political issues. Mostly it demanded more of a say for middle-class Indians in British Indian government. It had not yet developed into a permanent mass movement with local organisation. About this time her co-worker Leadbeater moved to Sydney.\n\nIn 1914 [[World War I]] broke out, and Britain asked for the support of its Empire in the fight against Germany. Echoing an Irish nationalist slogan, Besant declared, \"England's need is India's opportunity\". As editor of the [[New India]] newspaper, she attacked the [[British Raj|colonial government]] of India and called for clear and decisive moves towards self-rule. As with Ireland, the government refused to discuss any changes while the war lasted.\n\n[[File:Annie Besant.001.jpg|thumb|Annie Besant in Sydney, 1922]]\nIn 1916 Besant launched the [[All India Home Rule League]] along with [[Lokmanya Tilak]], once again modelling demands for India on Irish nationalist practices. This was the first political party in India to have regime change as its main goal. Unlike the Congress itself, the League worked all year round. It built a structure of local branches, enabling it to mobilise demonstrations, public meetings and agitations. In June 1917 Besant was arrested and interned at a [[hill station]], where she defiantly flew a red and green flag.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/house-arrest-of-annie-besant-remembered/article19201976.ece|title=House arrest of Annie Besant remembered|last=|first=|date=2017-07-03|work=The Hindu|access-date=2019-07-10|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref> The Congress and the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] together threatened to launch protests if she were not set free; Besant's arrest had created a focus for protest.<ref>{{cite book|title=India through the ages|url=https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= [https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada/page/192 192]|editor=K.S.

[[Jawaharlal Nehru]], Gandhi's closest collaborator, had been educated by a theosophist tutor.\n\nThe new leadership was committed to action that was both militant and non-violent, but there were differences between them and Besant.

He wrote ''The Besant Pedigree'' (1930) and was director of the Theosophical bookstore in London.

Mattauch was appointed director of the Institute. Mattauch developed [[tuberculosis]], and, in his absence, Strassman became acting director in 1948. As of 1949, the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institute was renamed the [[Max Planck Institute for Chemistry]], and moved from Tailfingen to [[Mainz]], [[Germany]].\n\nIn 1950 Strassmann became the official director of the Institute.<ref name=\"Chronik\">{{cite web |title=Chronik des Kaiser-Wilhelm- / Max-Planck-Instituts f\u00fcr Chemie |url=https://www.mpic.de/3557710/Chronik_kompl_kl.pdf |website=Max-Planck-Instituts f\u00fcr Chemie |accessdate=26 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Palme\">{{cite journal |last1=Palme |first1=Herbert |title=Cosmochemistry along the Rhine |journal=Geochemical Perspectives |date=2018 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=4-10 |url=http://www.geochemicalperspectives.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/v7n1.pdf}}</ref> After Mattauch returned to the institute in 1951, there was considerable conflict over the allocation of resources to their respective departments.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/>\n\n===Renewed research===\nIn 1953, Strassmann gave up the directorship, choosing instead to focus on his research and scholarship at the University of Mainz.

He negotiated with the university and with [[BASF|Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabriken]] (B.A.S.F.) to fund an institute for the chemical sciences at the university with a focus on nuclear chemistry.

Of these three scientists, only Strassmann was able to remain focused on their joint experimental investigations. Meitner, being Jewish, was forced to leave Nazi Germany, and Hahn had extensive administrative duties.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/> \n\n[[File:Nuclear Fission Experimental Apparatus 1938 - Deutsches Museum - Munich.jpg|thumb|Nuclear Fission Experimental Apparatus 1938, used by Strassmann and Hahn ([[Deutsches Museum]])]]\nIn 1937 and 1938, scientists [[Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie]] and Paul Savi\u010d reported results from their investigations on irradiating uranium with neutrons. They were unable to identify the substances that formed as a result of the uranium irradiation. Strassmann, with Hahn, were able to identify the element barium as a major end product in the neutron bombardment of uranium. The result was surprising because of the large difference in [[atomic number]] of the two elements, uranium having atomic number 92 and barium having atomic number 56.<ref name=\"Krafft\" />\n\nIn December 1938, Hahn and Strassmann sent a manuscript to ''[[Die Naturwissenschaften|Naturwissenschaften]]'' reporting the results of their experiments on detection of barium as a product of neutron bombardment of uranium<ref>O.

He also elucidated methods for the dating the age of minerals based on the half-life of radioactive elements and the enrichment of decay products. Strassmann and [[Ernst Walling]] developed the rubidium-strontium method of [[radiometric dating]] in 1936 and 1937, and Strassmann continued this work in 1942 and 1943.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/> \n\nOn 15 February 1944 and again on 24 March 1944, as part of the [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II]], the Institute suffered severe bombing damage.

Mattauch was appointed director of the Institute. Mattauch developed [[tuberculosis]], and, in his absence, Strassman became acting director in 1948. As of 1949, the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institute was renamed the [[Max Planck Institute for Chemistry]], and moved from Tailfingen to [[Mainz]], [[Germany]].\n\nIn 1950 Strassmann became the official director of the Institute.<ref name=\"Chronik\">{{cite web |title=Chronik des Kaiser-Wilhelm- / Max-Planck-Instituts f\u00fcr Chemie |url=https://www.mpic.de/3557710/Chronik_kompl_kl.pdf |website=Max-Planck-Instituts f\u00fcr Chemie |accessdate=26 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Palme\">{{cite journal |last1=Palme |first1=Herbert |title=Cosmochemistry along the Rhine |journal=Geochemical Perspectives |date=2018 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=4-10 |url=http://www.geochemicalperspectives.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/v7n1.pdf}}</ref> After Mattauch returned to the institute in 1951, there was considerable conflict over the allocation of resources to their respective departments.<ref name=\"Krafft\"/>\n\n===Renewed research===\nIn 1953, Strassmann gave up the directorship, choosing instead to focus on his research and scholarship at the University of Mainz. He succeeded in building up the department's capabilities, and he worked directly with students. Strassmann began these undertakings at the University of Mainz with a few scattered rooms and very little money.  He negotiated with the university and with [[BASF|Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabriken]] (B.A.S.F.) to fund an institute for the chemical sciences at the university with a focus on nuclear chemistry. He also lobbied the German federal government to fund a [[neutron generator]], a [[nuclear reactor]] for research purposes, and a special institute for nuclear chemistry.
