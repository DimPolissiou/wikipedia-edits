While Britain formed part of the [[Roman Empire]], Latin became the principal language of the elite, especially in the more Romanised south and east of the island. However, in the less Romanised north and west it never substantially replaced the [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic language]] of the indigenous [[Britons (Celtic people)|Britons]]. In recent years, scholars have debated the extent to which British Latin was distinguishable from its continental counterparts, which developed into the [[Romance languages]].\n\nWith the end of Roman rule, Latin was displaced as a spoken language by [[Old English]] in most of what became [[England]] during the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Anglo-Saxon settlement]] of the fifth and sixth centuries. It survived in the remaining Celtic regions of western Britain and had died out by about 700, when it was replaced by the local [[Brittonic languages]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Roman.Britain.Romanisation.jpg|thumb|300px|Relative degrees of Romanisation, based on archaeology.

The name is derived from ''(t)ape (ar)chive'', as it was originally developed to write data to sequential [[Input/output|I/O]] devices with no file system of their own. The archive data sets created by tar contain various [[file system]] parameters, such as name, time stamps, ownership, file access permissions, and  [[Directory (computing)|directory]] organization.  The command line utility was first introduced in the [[Version 7 Unix]] in January 1979, replacing the tp program.<ref name=\"tar5\">{{cite web |url=https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tar&apropos=0&sektion=5&manpath=FreeBSD+7.0-RELEASE&arch=default&format=html |title=tar(5) manual page |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=20 May 2004 |website=freebsd.org |publisher=FreeBSD |access-date=2 May 2017}}</ref>  The [[file format|file structure]] to store this information was standardized in [[POSIX]].1-1988<ref>''IEEE Std 1003.1-1988, IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)''</ref> and later POSIX.1-2001,<ref>IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, ''IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)''</ref> and became a format supported by most modern file archiving systems.\n\n==Rationale==\nMany historic tape drives read and write variable-length data blocks, leaving significant wasted space on the tape between blocks (for the tape to physically start and stop moving).  Some tape drives (and raw disks) support only fixed-length data blocks.  Also, when writing to any medium such as a filesystem or network, it takes less time to write one large block than many small blocks.  Therefore, the tar command writes data in blocks of many 512 byte records.  The user can specify a blocking factor, which is the number of records per block; the default is 20, producing 10 kilobyte blocks.<ref>[http://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/tar/html_node/tar_130.html \"Blocking'\"] ''ftp.gnu.org''. Retrieved 28 November 2013.</ref>\n\n==File format==\nA tar archive consists of a series of file objects, hence the popular term ''tarball'', referencing how a [[tarball (oil)|tarball]]  collects objects of all kinds that stick to its surface.  Each file object includes any file data, and is preceded by a 512-byte [[Header (computing)|header]] record.  The file data is written unaltered except that its length is rounded up to a multiple of 512 bytes. The original tar implementation did not care about the contents of the padding bytes, and left the buffer data unaltered, but most modern tar implementations fill the extra space with zeros.<ref name = \"Hoo, e7z Org., 2015\" > {{ Cite web | url = http://www.e7z.org/open-tar.htm | title = Open/Extract TAR File with Freeware on Windows/Mac/Linux | access-date = 2019-09-03 | first = James | last = Hoo | website = e7z Org. | format = html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150206035752/http://www.e7z.org/open-tar.htm | archive-date = 2015-02-06 | df = dmy-all }} </ref> The end of an archive is marked by at least two consecutive zero-filled records.  (The origin of tar's record size appears to be the 512-byte disk sectors used in the Version 7 Unix file system.) The final block of an archive is padded out to full length with zeros.\n\n===Header===\nThe file header record contains [[metadata]] about a file.  To ensure portability across different architectures with different [[Endianness|byte orderings]], the information in the header record is encoded in [[ASCII]].  Thus if all the files in an archive are ASCII text files, and have ASCII names, then the archive is essentially an ASCII text file (containing many [[Null character|NUL characters]]).\n\nThe fields defined by the original Unix tar format are listed in the table below.  The link indicator/file type table includes some modern extensions.  When a field is unused it is filled with NUL bytes.  The header uses 257 bytes, then is padded with NUL bytes to make it fill a 512 byte record.  There is no \"magic number\" in the header, for file identification.\n\nPre-POSIX.1-1988 (i.e. v7) tar header:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Field offset\n!Field size\n!Field\n|-\n|0\n|100\n|File name\n|-\n|100\n|8\n|File mode\n|-\n|108\n|8\n|Owner's numeric user ID\n|-\n|116\n|8\n|Group's numeric user ID\n|-\n|124\n|12\n|File size in bytes (octal base)\n|-\n|136\n|12\n|Last modification time in numeric Unix time format (octal)\n|-\n|148\n|8\n|Checksum for header record\n|-\n|156\n|1\n|Link indicator (file type)\n|-\n|157\n|100\n|Name of linked file\n|}\n\nThe pre-POSIX.1-1988 '''Link indicator''' field can have the following values:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Link indicator field\n!Value\n!Meaning\n|-\n|'0' or ([[ASCII]] [[Null character|NUL]])\n|Normal file\n|-\n|'1'\n|[[Hard link]]\n|-\n|'2'\n|[[Symbolic link]]\n|}\n\nSome pre-POSIX.1-1988 tar implementations indicated a directory by having a trailing [[slash (punctuation)|slash]] (/) in the name.\n\nNumeric values are encoded in [[octal]] numbers using ASCII digits, with leading zeroes.  For historical reasons, a final [[Null character|NUL]] or [[Space (punctuation)|space]] character should also be used. Thus although there are 12 bytes reserved for storing the file size, only 11 octal digits can be stored.  This gives a maximum file size of 8 [[gigabyte]]s on archived files.  To overcome this limitation, [[#Key implementations|star]] in 2001 introduced a base-256 coding that is indicated by setting the high-order bit of the leftmost byte of a numeric field. GNU-tar and BSD-tar followed this idea. Additionally, versions of tar from before the first POSIX standard from 1988 pad the values with spaces instead of zeroes.\n\nThe [[checksum]] is calculated by taking the sum of the unsigned byte values of the header record ''with the eight checksum bytes taken to be ascii spaces'' (decimal value 32).  It is stored as a six digit octal number with leading zeroes followed by a NUL and then a space. Various implementations do not adhere to this format. For better compatibility, ignore leading and trailing whitespace, and take the first six digits. In addition, some historic tar implementations treated bytes as signed. Implementations typically calculate the checksum both ways, and treat it as good if either the signed or unsigned sum matches the included checksum.\n\nUnix filesystems support multiple links (names) for the same file.  If several such files appear in a tar archive, only the first one is archived as a normal file; the rest are archived as hard links, with the \"name of linked file\" field set to the first one's name.  On extraction, such hard links should be recreated in the file system.\n\n===UStar format===\nMost modern tar programs read and write archives in the UStar (''Unix Standard TAR''<ref name=\"tar5\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Kientzle |first=Tim |date=1995 |title=Internet File Formats |publisher=Coriolis Groups Books |isbn=978-1-883577-56-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/mac_Internet_File_Formats_1995 |access-date=12 December 2015}}</ref>) format, introduced by the POSIX IEEE P1003.1 standard from 1988.  It introduced additional header fields.  Older tar programs will ignore the extra information (possibly extracting partially named files), while newer programs will test for the presence of the \"ustar\" string to determine if the new format is in use.  The UStar format allows for longer file names and stores additional information about each file.  The maximum filename size is 256, but it is split among a preceding path \"filename prefix\" and the filename itself, so can be much less.<ref name=\"gnu.org\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/tar_68.html |title = GNU tar 1.32: 8.1 Using Less Space through Compression | date = 2019-02-23 | website = GNU | access-date = 2019-08-11}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!Field offset\n!Field size\n!Field\n|-\n|0\n|156\n|''(several fields, same as in old format)''\n|-\n|156\n|1\n|Type flag\n|-\n|157\n|100\n|''(same field as in old format)''\n|-\n|257\n|6\n|UStar indicator \"ustar\" then NUL\n|-\n|263\n|2\n|UStar version \"00\"\n|-\n|265\n|32\n|Owner user name\n|-\n|297\n|32\n|Owner group name\n|-\n|329\n|8\n|Device major number\n|-\n|337\n|8\n|Device minor number\n|-\n|345\n|155\n|Filename prefix\n|}\n\nThe ''type flag'' field can have the following values:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Type flag field\n!Value\n!Meaning\n|-\n|'0' or ([[ASCII]] [[Null character|NUL]])\n|Normal file\n|-\n|'1'\n|[[Hard link]]\n|-\n|'2'\n|[[Symbolic link]]\n|-\n|'3'\n|[[Device file|Character special]]\n|-\n|'4'\n|[[Device file|Block special]]\n|-\n|'5'\n|[[Directory (computing)|Directory]]\n|-\n|'6'\n|[[Named pipe|FIFO]]\n|-\n| '7'\n| Contiguous file\n|-\n| 'g'\n| global extended header with meta data (POSIX.1-2001)\n|-\n| 'x'\n| extended header with meta data for the next file in the archive (POSIX.1-2001)\n|-\n| 'A'\u2013'Z'\n| Vendor specific extensions (POSIX.1-1988)\n|-\n| All other values\n| reserved for future standardization\n|}\n\nPOSIX.1-1988 vendor specific extensions using link flag values 'A'..'Z' partially have a different meaning with different vendors and thus are seen outdated and replaced by the POSIX.1-2001 extensions that also include a vendor tag.\n\nType '7' (Contiguous file) is formally marked as reserved in the POSIX standard, but was meant to indicate files which ought to be contiguously allocated on disk. Few operating systems support creating such files explicitly, and hence most TAR programs do not support them, and will treat type 7 files as if they were type 0 (regular). An exception is older versions of GNU tar, when running on the [[MASSCOMP]] RTU (Real Time Unix) operating system, which supported an O_CTG flag to the open() function to request a contiguous file; however, that support was removed from GNU tar version 1.24 onwards.\n\n===POSIX.1-2001/pax===\nIn 1997, [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] proposed a method for adding extensions to the tar format. This method was later accepted for the POSIX.1-2001 standard. This format is known as ''extended tar'' format or [[pax (Unix)|pax]]  format. The new tar format allows users to add any type of vendor-tagged vendor-specific enhancements. The following tags are defined by the POSIX standard:\n\n* '''atime''', '''mtime''': all three time stamps of a file in arbitrary resolution (most implementations use nanosecond granularity)\n* '''path''': path names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* '''linkpath''': symlink target names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* '''uname''', '''gname''': user and group names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* '''size''': files with unlimited size (the historic tar format is 8 GB)\n* '''uid''', '''gid''': userid and groupid without size limitation (this historic tar format was is limited to a max. id of 2097151)\n* a character set definition for path names and user/group names ([[UTF-8]])\n\nIn 2001, the Star program became the first tar to support the new format. In 2004, GNU tar supported the new format, though it does not write them as its default output from the tar program yet.<ref name=\"gnu.org\"/>\n\nIt's designed so that all implementations able to read the UStar format will be able to read POSIX.1-2001 as well. The only exceptions are files that make use of extended features, such as longer file names. For compatibility, these are encoded in the tar files as special {{code|x}} or {{code|g}} type files. typically under a {{code|PaxHeaders.XXXX}} directory.<ref>{{man|1|pax|SUS}}</ref>{{rp|exthdr.name}} A Pax-supporting implementation would make use of the info, while non supporting ones like [[7-Zip]] would process them as extra files.<ref>{{cite web |title=#2116 Tars with pax headers not parsed |url=https://sourceforge.net/p/sevenzip/bugs/2116/ |website=7-Zip / Bugs | SourceForge}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n=== Command syntax ===\n tar [-options] <name of the tar archive> [files or directories which to add into archive]\nBasic options:\n* <code>-c, --create</code> \u2014 create a new archive;\n* <code>-a, --auto-compress</code>  \u2014 additionally compress the archive with a compressor which will be automatically determined by the file name extension of the archive. If the archive's name ends with {{code|*.tar.gz}} then use [[gzip]], if {{code|*.tar.xz}} then use [[XZ Utils|xz]], {{code|*.tar.zst}} for [[Zstandard]] etc.;\n* <code>-r, --append</code> \u2014 append files to the end of an archive;\n* <code>-x, --extract, --get</code> \u2014 extract files from an archive;\n* <code>-f, --file</code> \u2014 specify the archive's name;\n* <code>-t, --list</code> \u2014 show a list of files and folders in the archive;\n* <code>-v, --verbose</code> \u2014 show a list of processed files.\n\n=== Basic usage ===\nCreate an archive file {{code|archive.tar}} from the file {{code|README.txt}} and directory {{code|src}}:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -cvf archive.tar README.txt src\n</source>\n\nExtract contents for the {{code|archive.tar}} into the current directory:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -xvf archive.tar\n</source>\n\nCreate an archive file {{code|archive.tar.gz}} from the file {{code|README.txt}} and directory {{code|src}} and compress it with [[gzip]] :\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -cavf archive.tar.gz README.txt src\n</source>\n\nExtract contents for the {{code|archive.tar.gz}} into the current directory:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -xvf archive.tar.gz\n</source>\n\n===Tarpipe===\nA tarpipe is the method of creating an archive on the [[Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|standard output]] file of the tar utility and piping it to another tar process on its [[Standard streams#Standard input (stdin)|standard input]], working in another directory, where it is unpacked.  This process copies an entire source directory tree including all special files, for example:\n tar cf - ''srcdir'' | tar x -C ''destdir''\n\n===Software distribution===\nThe tar format continues to be used extensively for [[Open-source model|open-source]] [[software distribution]].  *NIX-distributions use features prominently in various source- and binary-package distribution mechanisms, with most software [[source code]] made available in [[gzip]] compressed tar archives (.tar.gz, .tpz or .tgz file suffix).\n\n==Limitations==\nThe original tar format was created in the early days of UNIX, and despite current widespread use, many of its design features are considered dated.<ref>[http://duplicity.nongnu.org/new_format.html Proposed format to replace tar, by the Duplicity utility's developers.]</ref>\n\nMany older tar implementations do not record nor restore extended attributes (xattrs) or [[Access control list|ACL]]s. In 2001, [[#Key implementations|Star]] introduced support for ACLs and extended attributes, through its own tags for POSIX.1-2001 pax.  Bsdtar uses the star extensions to support ACLs.<ref>{{Man|1|tar|FreeBSD}}</ref> More recent versions of GNU tar support Linux extended attributes, reimplementing star extensions.<ref name = \"Les bons comptes, 2014\"> {{ Cite web | url = http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/extattrs.html | title = Extended attributes: the good, the not so good, the bad. | access-date = 2019-09-03 | date = 2014-07-15 | website = Les bons comptes | quote = The extended attributes can be very valuable for storing file metadata (e.g. author&#61;&#34;John Smith&#34;, subject&#61;&#34;country landscape&#34;), in the many cases where you do not want or can\u2019t store this data in the file internal properties. | format = html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141214001530/http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/extattrs.html | archive-date = 2014-12-14 \u00a0| df = dmy-all }} </ref> Other formats have been created to address the shortcomings of tar.\n\n===Operating system support===\n[[Unix-like]] operating systems usually include tools to support tar files, as well as utilities commonly used to compress them, such as [[gzip]] and [[bzip2]]. BSD-tar has been included in [[Microsoft Windows]] since [[Windows 10 version history|Windows 10 April 2018 Update]]<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Announcing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 17063 for PC\n |url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/12/19/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17063-pc/\n |website=Windows Experience Blog\n |accessdate=2 July 2018\n|date=2017-12-19\n }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Containers/Tar-and-Curl-Come-to-Windows/ba-p/382409 | title=Tar and Curl Come to Windows!| date=2019-03-22}}</ref>, and there are otherwise multiple third party tools available to read and write these formats on Windows.\n\n===Tarbomb===\n{{redirect-distinguish|Tarbomb|zip bomb}}\nA '''tarbomb''', in [[Jargon File|hacker slang]], is a tar file that contains many files that extract into the working directory. Such a tar file can create problems by overwriting files of the same name in the working directory, or mixing one project's files into another. It is at best an inconvenience to the user, who is obliged to identify and delete a number of files interspersed with the directory's other contents. Such behavior is considered bad etiquette on the part of the archive's creator.\n\nA related problem is the use of [[Path (computing)|absolute path]]s or [[Directory (computing)|parent directory]] references when creating tar files. Files extracted from such archives will often be created in unusual locations outside the working directory and, like a tarbomb, have the potential to overwrite existing files. However, modern versions of FreeBSD and GNU tar do not create or extract absolute paths and parent-directory references by default, unless it is explicitly allowed with the flag {{code|-P}} or the option {{code|--absolute-names}}. The bsdtar program, which is also available on many operating systems and is the default tar utility on [[macOS|Mac OS X]] v10.6, also does not follow parent-directory references or symbolic links.<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/bsdtar.1.html Man page for \"bsdtar\", as provided by Apple.]</ref>\n\nIf a user has only a very old tar available, which does not feature those security measures, these problems can be mitigated by first examining a tar file using the command <code>tar tf archive.tar</code>, which lists the contents and allows to exclude problematic files afterwards.\n\nThese commands do not extract any files, but display the names of all files in the archive. If any are problematic, the user can create a new empty directory and extract the archive into it\u2014or avoid the tar file entirely. Most graphical tools can display the contents of the archive before extracting them. [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] can open tar archives and display their contents. [[GNU Emacs]] is also able to open a tar archive and display its contents in a [[dired]] buffer.\n\n===Random access===\nThe tar format was designed without a centralized index or table of content for files and their properties for streaming to tape backup devices. The archive must be read sequentially to list or extract files. For large tar archives, this causes a performance penalty, making tar archives unsuitable for situations that often require random access to individual files.\n\n===Duplicates===\nAnother issue with tar format is that it allows several (possibly different) files in archive to have identical path and filename. When extracting such archive, usually the latter version of a file overwrites the former.\n\nThis can create a non-explicit (unobvious) tarbomb, which technically does not contain files with absolute paths or referring parent directories, but still causes overwriting files outside current directory (for example, archive may contain two files with the same path and filename, first of which is a [[symbolic link|symlink]] to some location outside current directory, and second of which is a regular file; then extracting such archive on some tar implementations may cause writing to the location pointed to by the symlink).\n\n==Key implementations==\n<!-- Implementations included with major unixoid OS only. No general archivers that can just \"also\" do tar - they probably just include libarchive included here. -->\n\nHistorically, many systems have implemented tar, and many [[Comparison of file archivers|general file archivers]] have at least partial support for tar (often using one of the implementations below). The history of tar is a story of incompatibilities, known as the \"tar wars\". Most tar implementations can also read and create [[cpio]] and [[pax (Unix)|pax]] (the latter actually is a ''tar''-format with [[POSIX]]-2001-extensions).\n\nKey implementations in order of origin:\n\n* '''[[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] tar''', based on the original UNIX V7 tar <!-- is this correct? --> and comes as the default on the Solaris operating system\n* '''[[GNU]] tar''' is the default on most [[Linux]] distributions. It is based on the public domain implementation pdtar which started in 1987. Recent versions can use various formats, including ustar, pax, GNU and v7 formats.\n* '''[[FreeBSD]] tar''' (also '''BSD tar''') has become the default tar on most [[Berkeley Software Distribution]]-based operating systems including [[macOS|Mac OS X]]. The core functionality is available as '''libarchive''' for inclusion in other applications.  This implementation automatically detects the format of the file and can extract from tar, pax, cpio, zip, jar, ar, xar, rpm and ISO 9660 cdrom images. It also comes with a functionally equivalent cpio command-line interface.\n* '''Schily tar''', better known as '''star''', is historically significant as some of its extensions were quite popular. It is the oldest [[free software|free]] tar from 1982. It is still maintained.<ref>{{man|1|star|ManKier}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, most [[Pax (Unix)|pax]] and [[cpio]] implementations can read and create many types of tar files.\n\n==Suffixes for compressed files==\n''tar'' archive files usually have the file suffix ''.tar'', e.g., ''somefile.tar''.\n\nA tar archive file contains uncompressed byte streams of the files which it contains. To achieve archive compression, a variety of [[data compression|compression]] programs are available, such as [[gzip]], [[bzip2]], [[XZ Utils|xz]], [[lzip]], [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Markov chain algorithm|lzma]], [[Zstandard|zstd]], or [[compress]], which compress the entire tar archive. Typically, the compressed form of the archive receives a filename by appending the format-specific compressor suffix to the archive file name. For example, a tar archive ''archive.tar'', is named ''archive.tar.gz'', when it is compressed by gzip.\n\nPopular tar programs like the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] and [[GNU]] versions of tar support the [[Command-line interface|command line options]] ''Z'' (compress), ''z'' (gzip), and ''j'' (bzip2) to compress or decompress the archive file upon creation or unpacking. [[GNU]] tar from version 1.20 onwards also supports the option ''--lzma'' ([[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Markov chain algorithm|LZMA]]). 1.21 added support for [[lzop]] with ''--lzop''. 1.22 added support for [[XZ Utils|xz]] with ''--xz'' or ''-J''. 1.23 added support for [[lzip]] with ''--lzip''. 1.31 added support for [[Zstandard|zstd]] with ''--zstd''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2019-01/msg00001.html | title = tar-1.31 released [stable] | last = Poznyakoff | first = Sergey | date = 2019-01-02 | website = GNU mailing lists | access-date = 2019-08-06}}</ref> The decompression of these formats is handled automatically if supported filename extensions are used, and compression is handled automatically using the same filename extensions if the option ''--auto-compress'' (short form ''-a'') is passed to an applicable version of GNU tar.<ref name=\"gnu.org\"/>\n\n[[MS-DOS]]'s [[8.3 filename]] limitations resulted in additional conventions for naming compressed tar archives. (This practice has declined with [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] offering [[Long filename|long filenames]].)\n\n[[Image:Targzip.svg|thumb|400px|Tar archiving is often used together with a compression method, such as [[gzip]], to create a compressed archive.

The name is derived from ''(t)ape (ar)chive'', as it was originally developed to write data to sequential [[Input/output|I/O]] devices with no file system of their own. The archive data sets created by tar contain various [[file system]] parameters, such as name, time stamps, ownership, file access permissions, and  [[Directory (computing)|directory]] organization.  The command line utility was first introduced in the [[Version 7 Unix]] in January 1979, replacing the tp program.<ref name=\"tar5\">{{cite web |url=https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tar&apropos=0&sektion=5&manpath=FreeBSD+7.0-RELEASE&arch=default&format=html |title=tar(5) manual page |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=20 May 2004 |website=freebsd.org |publisher=FreeBSD |access-date=2 May 2017}}</ref>  The [[file format|file structure]] to store this information was standardized in [[POSIX]].1-1988<ref>''IEEE Std 1003.1-1988, IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)''</ref> and later POSIX.1-2001,<ref>IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, ''IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)''</ref> and became a format supported by most modern file archiving systems.\n\n==Rationale==\nMany historic tape drives read and write variable-length data blocks, leaving significant wasted space on the tape between blocks (for the tape to physically start and stop moving).  Some tape drives (and raw disks) support only fixed-length data blocks.  Also, when writing to any medium such as a filesystem or network, it takes less time to write one large block than many small blocks.  Therefore, the tar command writes data in blocks of many 512 byte records.  The user can specify a blocking factor, which is the number of records per block; the default is 20, producing 10 kilobyte blocks.<ref>[http://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/tar/html_node/tar_130.html \"Blocking'\"] ''ftp.gnu.org''. Retrieved 28 November 2013.</ref>\n\n==File format==\nA tar archive consists of a series of file objects, hence the popular term ''tarball'', referencing how a [[tarball (oil)|tarball]]  collects objects of all kinds that stick to its surface.  Each file object includes any file data, and is preceded by a 512-byte [[Header (computing)|header]] record.  The file data is written unaltered except that its length is rounded up to a multiple of 512 bytes. The original tar implementation did not care about the contents of the padding bytes, and left the buffer data unaltered, but most modern tar implementations fill the extra space with zeros.<ref name = \"Hoo, e7z Org., 2015\" > {{ Cite web | url = http://www.e7z.org/open-tar.htm | title = Open/Extract TAR File with Freeware on Windows/Mac/Linux | access-date = 2019-09-03 | first = James | last = Hoo | website = e7z Org. | format = html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150206035752/http://www.e7z.org/open-tar.htm | archive-date = 2015-02-06 | df = dmy-all }} </ref> The end of an archive is marked by at least two consecutive zero-filled records.  (The origin of tar's record size appears to be the 512-byte disk sectors used in the Version 7 Unix file system.) The final block of an archive is padded out to full length with zeros.\n\n===Header===\nThe file header record contains [[metadata]] about a file.  To ensure portability across different architectures with different [[Endianness|byte orderings]], the information in the header record is encoded in [[ASCII]].  Thus if all the files in an archive are ASCII text files, and have ASCII names, then the archive is essentially an ASCII text file (containing many [[Null character|NUL characters]]).\n\nThe fields defined by the original Unix tar format are listed in the table below.  The link indicator/file type table includes some modern extensions.  When a field is unused it is filled with NUL bytes.  The header uses 257 bytes, then is padded with NUL bytes to make it fill a 512 byte record.  There is no \"magic number\" in the header, for file identification.\n\nPre-POSIX.1-1988 (i.e. v7) tar header:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Field offset\n!Field size\n!Field\n|-\n|0\n|100\n|File name\n|-\n|100\n|8\n|File mode\n|-\n|108\n|8\n|Owner's numeric user ID\n|-\n|116\n|8\n|Group's numeric user ID\n|-\n|124\n|12\n|File size in bytes (octal base)\n|-\n|136\n|12\n|Last modification time in numeric Unix time format (octal)\n|-\n|148\n|8\n|Checksum for header record\n|-\n|156\n|1\n|Link indicator (file type)\n|-\n|157\n|100\n|Name of linked file\n|}\n\nThe pre-POSIX.1-1988 '''Link indicator''' field can have the following values:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Link indicator field\n!Value\n!Meaning\n|-\n|'0' or ([[ASCII]] [[Null character|NUL]])\n|Normal file\n|-\n|'1'\n|[[Hard link]]\n|-\n|'2'\n|[[Symbolic link]]\n|}\n\nSome pre-POSIX.1-1988 tar implementations indicated a directory by having a trailing [[slash (punctuation)|slash]] (/) in the name.\n\nNumeric values are encoded in [[octal]] numbers using ASCII digits, with leading zeroes.  For historical reasons, a final [[Null character|NUL]] or [[Space (punctuation)|space]] character should also be used. Thus although there are 12 bytes reserved for storing the file size, only 11 octal digits can be stored.  This gives a maximum file size of 8 [[gigabyte]]s on archived files.  To overcome this limitation, [[#Key implementations|star]] in 2001 introduced a base-256 coding that is indicated by setting the high-order bit of the leftmost byte of a numeric field. GNU-tar and BSD-tar followed this idea. Additionally, versions of tar from before the first POSIX standard from 1988 pad the values with spaces instead of zeroes.\n\nThe [[checksum]] is calculated by taking the sum of the unsigned byte values of the header record ''with the eight checksum bytes taken to be ascii spaces'' (decimal value 32).  It is stored as a six digit octal number with leading zeroes followed by a NUL and then a space. Various implementations do not adhere to this format. For better compatibility, ignore leading and trailing whitespace, and take the first six digits. In addition, some historic tar implementations treated bytes as signed. Implementations typically calculate the checksum both ways, and treat it as good if either the signed or unsigned sum matches the included checksum.\n\nUnix filesystems support multiple links (names) for the same file.  If several such files appear in a tar archive, only the first one is archived as a normal file; the rest are archived as hard links, with the \"name of linked file\" field set to the first one's name.  On extraction, such hard links should be recreated in the file system.\n\n===UStar format===\nMost modern tar programs read and write archives in the UStar (''Unix Standard TAR''<ref name=\"tar5\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Kientzle |first=Tim |date=1995 |title=Internet File Formats |publisher=Coriolis Groups Books |isbn=978-1-883577-56-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/mac_Internet_File_Formats_1995 |access-date=12 December 2015}}</ref>) format, introduced by the POSIX IEEE P1003.1 standard from 1988.  It introduced additional header fields.  Older tar programs will ignore the extra information (possibly extracting partially named files), while newer programs will test for the presence of the \"ustar\" string to determine if the new format is in use.  The UStar format allows for longer file names and stores additional information about each file.  The maximum filename size is 256, but it is split among a preceding path \"filename prefix\" and the filename itself, so can be much less.<ref name=\"gnu.org\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/tar_68.html |title = GNU tar 1.32: 8.1 Using Less Space through Compression | date = 2019-02-23 | website = GNU | access-date = 2019-08-11}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!Field offset\n!Field size\n!Field\n|-\n|0\n|156\n|''(several fields, same as in old format)''\n|-\n|156\n|1\n|Type flag\n|-\n|157\n|100\n|''(same field as in old format)''\n|-\n|257\n|6\n|UStar indicator \"ustar\" then NUL\n|-\n|263\n|2\n|UStar version \"00\"\n|-\n|265\n|32\n|Owner user name\n|-\n|297\n|32\n|Owner group name\n|-\n|329\n|8\n|Device major number\n|-\n|337\n|8\n|Device minor number\n|-\n|345\n|155\n|Filename prefix\n|}\n\nThe ''type flag'' field can have the following values:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Type flag field\n!Value\n!Meaning\n|-\n|'0' or ([[ASCII]] [[Null character|NUL]])\n|Normal file\n|-\n|'1'\n|[[Hard link]]\n|-\n|'2'\n|[[Symbolic link]]\n|-\n|'3'\n|[[Device file|Character special]]\n|-\n|'4'\n|[[Device file|Block special]]\n|-\n|'5'\n|[[Directory (computing)|Directory]]\n|-\n|'6'\n|[[Named pipe|FIFO]]\n|-\n| '7'\n| Contiguous file\n|-\n| 'g'\n| global extended header with meta data (POSIX.1-2001)\n|-\n| 'x'\n| extended header with meta data for the next file in the archive (POSIX.1-2001)\n|-\n| 'A'\u2013'Z'\n| Vendor specific extensions (POSIX.1-1988)\n|-\n| All other values\n| reserved for future standardization\n|}\n\nPOSIX.1-1988 vendor specific extensions using link flag values 'A'..'Z' partially have a different meaning with different vendors and thus are seen outdated and replaced by the POSIX.1-2001 extensions that also include a vendor tag.\n\nType '7' (Contiguous file) is formally marked as reserved in the POSIX standard, but was meant to indicate files which ought to be contiguously allocated on disk. Few operating systems support creating such files explicitly, and hence most TAR programs do not support them, and will treat type 7 files as if they were type 0 (regular). An exception is older versions of GNU tar, when running on the [[MASSCOMP]] RTU (Real Time Unix) operating system, which supported an O_CTG flag to the open() function to request a contiguous file; however, that support was removed from GNU tar version 1.24 onwards.\n\n===POSIX.1-2001/pax===\nIn 1997, [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] proposed a method for adding extensions to the tar format. This method was later accepted for the POSIX.1-2001 standard. This format is known as ''extended tar'' format or [[pax (Unix)|pax]]  format. The new tar format allows users to add any type of vendor-tagged vendor-specific enhancements. The following tags are defined by the POSIX standard:\n\n* '''atime''', '''mtime''': all three time stamps of a file in arbitrary resolution (most implementations use nanosecond granularity)\n* '''path''': path names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* '''linkpath''': symlink target names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* '''uname''', '''gname''': user and group names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* '''size''': files with unlimited size (the historic tar format is 8 GB)\n* '''uid''', '''gid''': userid and groupid without size limitation (this historic tar format was is limited to a max. id of 2097151)\n* a character set definition for path names and user/group names ([[UTF-8]])\n\nIn 2001, the Star program became the first tar to support the new format. In 2004, GNU tar supported the new format, though it does not write them as its default output from the tar program yet.<ref name=\"gnu.org\"/>\n\nIt's designed so that all implementations able to read the UStar format will be able to read POSIX.1-2001 as well. The only exceptions are files that make use of extended features, such as longer file names. For compatibility, these are encoded in the tar files as special {{code|x}} or {{code|g}} type files. typically under a {{code|PaxHeaders.XXXX}} directory.<ref>{{man|1|pax|SUS}}</ref>{{rp|exthdr.name}} A Pax-supporting implementation would make use of the info, while non supporting ones like [[7-Zip]] would process them as extra files.<ref>{{cite web |title=#2116 Tars with pax headers not parsed |url=https://sourceforge.net/p/sevenzip/bugs/2116/ |website=7-Zip / Bugs | SourceForge}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n=== Command syntax ===\n tar [-options] <name of the tar archive> [files or directories which to add into archive]\nBasic options:\n* <code>-c, --create</code> \u2014 create a new archive;\n* <code>-a, --auto-compress</code>  \u2014 additionally compress the archive with a compressor which will be automatically determined by the file name extension of the archive. If the archive's name ends with {{code|*.tar.gz}} then use [[gzip]], if {{code|*.tar.xz}} then use [[XZ Utils|xz]], {{code|*.tar.zst}} for [[Zstandard]] etc.;\n* <code>-r, --append</code> \u2014 append files to the end of an archive;\n* <code>-x, --extract, --get</code> \u2014 extract files from an archive;\n* <code>-f, --file</code> \u2014 specify the archive's name;\n* <code>-t, --list</code> \u2014 show a list of files and folders in the archive;\n* <code>-v, --verbose</code> \u2014 show a list of processed files.\n\n=== Basic usage ===\nCreate an archive file {{code|archive.tar}} from the file {{code|README.txt}} and directory {{code|src}}:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -cvf archive.tar README.txt src\n</source>\n\nExtract contents for the {{code|archive.tar}} into the current directory:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -xvf archive.tar\n</source>\n\nCreate an archive file {{code|archive.tar.gz}} from the file {{code|README.txt}} and directory {{code|src}} and compress it with [[gzip]] :\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -cavf archive.tar.gz README.txt src\n</source>\n\nExtract contents for the {{code|archive.tar.gz}} into the current directory:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -xvf archive.tar.gz\n</source>\n\n===Tarpipe===\nA tarpipe is the method of creating an archive on the [[Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|standard output]] file of the tar utility and piping it to another tar process on its [[Standard streams#Standard input (stdin)|standard input]], working in another directory, where it is unpacked.  This process copies an entire source directory tree including all special files, for example:\n tar cf - ''srcdir'' | tar x -C ''destdir''\n\n===Software distribution===\nThe tar format continues to be used extensively for [[Open-source model|open-source]] [[software distribution]].  *NIX-distributions use features prominently in various source- and binary-package distribution mechanisms, with most software [[source code]] made available in [[gzip]] compressed tar archives (.tar.gz, .tpz or .tgz file suffix).\n\n==Limitations==\nThe original tar format was created in the early days of UNIX, and despite current widespread use, many of its design features are considered dated.<ref>[http://duplicity.nongnu.org/new_format.html Proposed format to replace tar, by the Duplicity utility's developers.]</ref>\n\nMany older tar implementations do not record nor restore extended attributes (xattrs) or [[Access control list|ACL]]s. In 2001, [[#Key implementations|Star]] introduced support for ACLs and extended attributes, through its own tags for POSIX.1-2001 pax.  Bsdtar uses the star extensions to support ACLs.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} More recent versions of GNU tar support Linux extended attributes, reimplementing star extensions.<ref name = \"Les bons comptes, 2014\"> {{ Cite web | url = http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/extattrs.html | title = Extended attributes: the good, the not so good, the bad. | access-date = 2019-09-03 | date = 2014-07-15 | website = Les bons comptes | quote = The extended attributes can be very valuable for storing file metadata (e.g. author&#61;&#34;John Smith&#34;, subject&#61;&#34;country landscape&#34;), in the many cases where you do not want or can\u2019t store this data in the file internal properties. | format = html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141214001530/http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/extattrs.html | archive-date = 2014-12-14  | df = dmy-all }} </ref> Other formats have been created to address the shortcomings of tar.\n\n===Operating system support===\n[[Unix-like]] operating systems usually include tools to support tar files, as well as utilities commonly used to compress them, such as [[gzip]] and [[bzip2]]. BSD-tar has been included in [[Microsoft Windows]] since [[Windows 10 version history|Windows 10 April 2018 Update]]<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Announcing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 17063 for PC\n |url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/12/19/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17063-pc/\n |website=Windows Experience Blog\n |accessdate=2 July 2018\n|date=2017-12-19\n }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Containers/Tar-and-Curl-Come-to-Windows/ba-p/382409 | title=Tar and Curl Come to Windows!| date=2019-03-22}}</ref>, and there are otherwise multiple third party tools available to read and write these formats on Windows.\n\n===Tarbomb===\n{{redirect-distinguish|Tarbomb|zip bomb}}\nA '''tarbomb''', in [[Jargon File|hacker slang]], is a tar file that contains many files that extract into the working directory. Such a tar file can create problems by overwriting files of the same name in the working directory, or mixing one project's files into another. It is at best an inconvenience to the user, who is obliged to identify and delete a number of files interspersed with the directory's other contents. Such behavior is considered bad etiquette on the part of the archive's creator.\n\nA related problem is the use of [[Path (computing)|absolute path]]s or [[Directory (computing)|parent directory]] references when creating tar files. Files extracted from such archives will often be created in unusual locations outside the working directory and, like a tarbomb, have the potential to overwrite existing files. However, modern versions of FreeBSD and GNU tar do not create or extract absolute paths and parent-directory references by default, unless it is explicitly allowed with the flag {{code|-P}} or the option {{code|--absolute-names}}. The bsdtar program, which is also available on many operating systems and is the default tar utility on [[macOS|Mac OS X]] v10.6, also does not follow parent-directory references or symbolic links.<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/bsdtar.1.html Man page for \"bsdtar\", as provided by Apple.]</ref>\n\nIf a user has only a very old tar available, which does not feature those security measures, these problems can be mitigated by first examining a tar file using the command <code>tar tf archive.tar</code>, which lists the contents and allows to exclude problematic files afterwards.\n\nThese commands do not extract any files, but display the names of all files in the archive. If any are problematic, the user can create a new empty directory and extract the archive into it\u2014or avoid the tar file entirely. Most graphical tools can display the contents of the archive before extracting them. [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] can open tar archives and display their contents. [[GNU Emacs]] is also able to open a tar archive and display its contents in a [[dired]] buffer.\n\n===Random access===\nThe tar format was designed without a centralized index or table of content for files and their properties for streaming to tape backup devices. The archive must be read sequentially to list or extract files. For large tar archives, this causes a performance penalty, making tar archives unsuitable for situations that often require random access to individual files.\n\n===Duplicates===\nAnother issue with tar format is that it allows several (possibly different) files in archive to have identical path and filename. When extracting such archive, usually the latter version of a file overwrites the former.\n\nThis can create a non-explicit (unobvious) tarbomb, which technically does not contain files with absolute paths or referring parent directories, but still causes overwriting files outside current directory (for example, archive may contain two files with the same path and filename, first of which is a [[symbolic link|symlink]] to some location outside current directory, and second of which is a regular file; then extracting such archive on some tar implementations may cause writing to the location pointed to by the symlink).\n\n==Key implementations==\n<!-- Implementations included with major unixoid OS only. No general archivers that can just \"also\" do tar - they probably just include libarchive included here. -->\n\nHistorically, many systems have implemented tar, and many [[Comparison of file archivers|general file archivers]] have at least partial support for tar (often using one of the implementations below). The history of tar is a story of incompatibilities, known as the \"tar wars\". Most tar implementations can also read and create [[cpio]] and [[pax (Unix)|pax]] (the latter actually is a ''tar''-format with [[POSIX]]-2001-extensions).\n\nKey implementations in order of origin:\n\n* '''[[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] tar''', based on the original UNIX V7 tar <!-- is this correct? --> and comes as the default on the Solaris operating system\n* '''[[GNU]] tar''' is the default on most [[Linux]] distributions. It is based on the public domain implementation pdtar which started in 1987. Recent versions can use various formats, including ustar, pax, GNU and v7 formats.\n* '''[[FreeBSD]] tar''' (also '''BSD tar''') has become the default tar on most [[Berkeley Software Distribution]]-based operating systems including [[macOS|Mac OS X]]. The core functionality is available as '''libarchive''' for inclusion in other applications.  This implementation automatically detects the format of the file and can extract from tar, pax, cpio, zip, jar, ar, xar, rpm and ISO 9660 cdrom images. It also comes with a functionally equivalent cpio command-line interface.\n* '''Schily tar''', better known as '''star''', is historically significant as some of its extensions were quite popular. It is the oldest [[free software|free]] tar from 1982. It is still maintained.<ref>{{man|1|star|ManKier}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, most [[Pax (Unix)|pax]] and [[cpio]] implementations can read and create many types of tar files.\n\n==Suffixes for compressed files==\n''tar'' archive files usually have the file suffix ''.tar'', e.g., ''somefile.tar''.\n\nA tar archive file contains uncompressed byte streams of the files which it contains. To achieve archive compression, a variety of [[data compression|compression]] programs are available, such as [[gzip]], [[bzip2]], [[XZ Utils|xz]], [[lzip]], [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Markov chain algorithm|lzma]], [[Zstandard|zstd]], or [[compress]], which compress the entire tar archive. Typically, the compressed form of the archive receives a filename by appending the format-specific compressor suffix to the archive file name. For example, a tar archive ''archive.tar'', is named ''archive.tar.gz'', when it is compressed by gzip.\n\nPopular tar programs like the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] and [[GNU]] versions of tar support the [[Command-line interface|command line options]] ''Z'' (compress), ''z'' (gzip), and ''j'' (bzip2) to compress or decompress the archive file upon creation or unpacking. [[GNU]] tar from version 1.20 onwards also supports the option ''--lzma'' ([[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Markov chain algorithm|LZMA]]). 1.21 added support for [[lzop]] with ''--lzop''. 1.22 added support for [[XZ Utils|xz]] with ''--xz'' or ''-J''. 1.23 added support for [[lzip]] with ''--lzip''. 1.31 added support for [[Zstandard|zstd]] with ''--zstd''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2019-01/msg00001.html | title = tar-1.31 released [stable] | last = Poznyakoff | first = Sergey | date = 2019-01-02 | website = GNU mailing lists | access-date = 2019-08-06}}</ref> The decompression of these formats is handled automatically if supported filename extensions are used, and compression is handled automatically using the same filename extensions if the option ''--auto-compress'' (short form ''-a'') is passed to an applicable version of GNU tar.<ref name=\"gnu.org\"/>\n\n[[MS-DOS]]'s [[8.3 filename]] limitations resulted in additional conventions for naming compressed tar archives. (This practice has declined with [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] offering [[Long filename|long filenames]].)\n\n[[Image:Targzip.svg|thumb|400px|Tar archiving is often used together with a compression method, such as [[gzip]], to create a compressed archive.

The NCAA has officially recorded rebounding statistics since it first sponsored women's basketball. Whereas 3-point field goals were officially instituted by the NCAA for women's play in the 1987\u201388 season. \n\nUnlike for men's basketball, NCAA does not keep records of the top scorer (by total points) for a single-season. Records of the top scorer (by average points per game) for each season and scorers with more than 900 points in a season are however available. \n\n[[Kelsey Plum]] currently holds the single-season scoring record for [[NCAA Division I]] of 1,109 points, set during her senior season at [[Washington Huskies women's basketball|Washington]].

three-division format has been in place since the 1973\u201374 season, the organization did not sponsor women's sports until the 1981\u201382 school year; before that time, women's college sports were governed by the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW). The NCAA has officially recorded rebounding statistics since it first sponsored women's basketball. Whereas 3-point field goals were officially instituted by the NCAA for women's play in the 1987\u201388 season. \n\nUnlike for men's basketball, NCAA does not keep records of the top scorer (by total points) for a single-season. Records of the top scorer (by average points per game) for each season and scorers with more than 900 points in a season are however available. \n\n[[Kelsey Plum]] currently holds the single-season scoring record for [[NCAA Division I]] of 1,109 points, set during her senior season at [[Washington Huskies women's basketball|Washington]]. She is also the only NCAA Division I women's basketball player who scored more than 900 points each season in more than one season (2015\u201316 and 2016\u201317).

It was founded in 1782 with the [[History of Bangkok#Rattanakosin|establishment of Rattanakosin]] as the capital city. This article covers the period until the [[Siamese revolution of 1932]].\n\nThe maximum zone of influence of Rattanakosin included the [[vassal state]]s of [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Shan States]], and some [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] kingdoms. The kingdom was founded by [[Rama I]] of the [[Chakri Dynasty|Chakri]]. The first half of this period was characterized by the consolidation of the kingdom's power and was punctuated by periodic conflicts with [[Myanmar]], [[Vietnam]] and Laos. The second period was one of engagements with the [[colonialism|colonial]] powers of Britain and France in which Siam remained the only [[Southeast Asia]]n state to maintain its independence.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/thailand/history-rattanakosin.htm\n |title        = Rattanakosin Period (1782 -present)\n |publisher    = GlobalSecurity.org\n |accessdate   = 1 November 2015\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20151107223323/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/thailand/history-rattanakosin.htm\n |archive-date = 7 November 2015\n |url-status     = live\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n\nInternally the kingdom developed into a modern centralized [[nation state]] with borders defined by interactions with Western powers. Economic and social progress was made, marked by an increase in foreign trade, the abolition of [[slavery]] and the expansion of formal education to the emerging [[middle class]]. However, the failure to implement substantial political reforms culminated in the [[1932 revolution]] and the abandonment of absolute monarchy in favor of a constitutional monarchy.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Chao Phraya Chakri, later Phutthayotfa Chulalok or [[Rama I]].]]\n[[File:Bangkok (early Rattanakosin) map.svg|thumb|300px|right|Map of [[Bangkok]] in the early Rattanakosin period.]]\n[[File:Old Bangkok canals.gif|thumb|right|View of 19th-century Bangkok with the [[Wat Saket|Golden Mount]] in the background.|250px]]\n{{Main|History of Bangkok|Thonburi Kingdom}}\nIn 1767, after dominating Southeast Asia for almost four centuries, [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] was [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1765\u20131767)|brought down]] by invading Myanmarese armies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/576|title=Historic City of Ayutthaya|publisher=\u00a9 UNESCO World Heritage Center|accessdate=21 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023061657/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/576|archive-date=23 October 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDespite its complete defeat and subsequent occupation by the [[Konbaung dynasty]], Siam made a rapid recovery. The resistance to Myanmarese rule was led by a noble of [[Thai Chinese|Chinese descent]], [[Taksin]], a military leader. Initially based at [[Chanthaburi]] in the southeast, within a year, he had defeated the Myanmarese occupation army and reestablished a Siamese state with its capital at [[Thonburi]] on the west bank of the Chao Phraya, 20&nbsp;km from the sea. In 1768 he was crowned as Taksin. He re-united the [[central Thailand|central Thai]] heartlands under his rule, and in 1769 he also occupied western [[Cambodia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Thailand/History#ref509771|title=The Thon Buri and Early Bangkok periods|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=21 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121160210/http://www.britannica.com/place/Thailand/History#ref509771|archivedate=21 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHe then marched south and reestablished Siamese rule over the [[Malay Peninsula]] as far as [[Penang]] and [[Terengganu]]. Having secured his base in Siam, [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1775\u201376)|Taksin attacked the Myanmarese in the north in 1774]] and captured [[Chiang Mai]] in 1776, permanently uniting Siam and [[Lannathai|Lanna]]. Taksin's leading general in this campaign was [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok|Thong Duang]], known by the title ''Chaophraya'' or Lord Chakri was himself a descendant of [[Mon people]]. In 1778 Chakri led a Siamese army which captured [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]], also [[Kingdom of Luang Phrabang|Luang Phrabang]], a northern Lao kingdom submitted, and eventually established Siamese domination over Laotian kingdoms.\n\nDespite these successes, by 1779 Taksin was in political trouble at home. He seems to have developed a religious mania, alienating the powerful Buddhist monk-hood by claiming to be a ''[[Four stages of enlightenment#Stream-enterer|sotapanna]]'' or divine figure. He was also in troubles with the court officials, Chinese merchants, and missionaries. The foreign observers began to speculate that he would soon be overthrown. In 1782 Taksin sent his armies under Chakri, the future [[Rama (Kings of Thailand)|Rama]] I of Rattanakosin, to invade Cambodia, but while they were away a rebellion broke out in the area around the capital. The rebels, who had popular support, offered the throne to General Chakri, the 'supreme general'. Chakri who was on war duty marched back from Cambodia and deposed Taksin, who was purportedly 'secretly executed' shortly after.\n\nChakri ruled under the name Ramathibodi (he was posthumously given the name Phutthayotfa Chulalok), but is now generally known as [[Rama I]], first king of the later known [[Chakri dynasty]]. One of his first decisions was to move the capital across the river to the village of Bang Makok (meaning \"place of [[Spondias|olive plum]]s\").  The new capital was located on the [[Rattanakosin Island|island of Rattanakosin]], protected from attack by the river to the west and by a series of [[Khlong|canals]] to the north, east and south. Siam thus acquired both its current dynasty and its current capital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Thailand/History#ref509771|title=THE EARLY CHAKRI KINGS AND A RESURGENT SIAM|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=21 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121160210/http://www.britannica.com/place/Thailand/History#ref509771|archivedate=21 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n===Foundation (1782\u20131809) ===\n{{Main|Rama I}}\nRama I who was himself of [[Mon people|Mon]], Thai and [[Thai Chinese|Chinese descent]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/2001/JSS_098_0i_VanRoy_ProminentMonLineages.pdf |title=Prominent Mon Lineages from Late Ayutthaya to Early Bangkok |publisher=Siamese-heritage.org |accessdate=27 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052427/http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/2001/JSS_098_0i_VanRoy_ProminentMonLineages.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=Dilokwanich/> restored most of the social and political system of the Ayutthaya kingdom, promulgating new law codes, reinstating court ceremonies<ref name = \"Wales\">{{cite book |last= Wales |first= H.

His government was carried out by six great ministries ([[Thai royal and noble titles#Krom|Krom]]) headed by royal princes. Four of these administered particular territories: the [[Kalahom]] the south; the [[Mahatthai]] the north and east; the [[Phrakhlang]] the area immediately south of the capital; and the Krom [[Mueang]], the area around Bangkok. The other two were the ministry of lands (Krom Na) and the ministry of the royal court (Krom Wang). The army was controlled by the King's deputy and brother, the [[Uparat]].\n\nThe Myanmarese, seeing the disorder accompanying the overthrow of Taksin, invaded Siam again in 1785. Rama allowed them to occupy both the north and the south, but the ''Uparat'', ''vice-king'', his brother, led the Siamese army into western Siam and crushed the Myanmarese forces in a battle near [[Kanchanaburi]]. This was the last major Myanmarese invasion of Siam, although as late as 1802 Myanmarese forces had to be driven out of Lanna. In 1792 the Siamese occupied [[Luang Prabang]] and brought most of Laos under indirect Siamese rule. Cambodia was also effectively ruled by Siam. By the time of his death in 1809 Rama I had created a Siamese overlordship dominating an area considerably larger than modern Thailand.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FMJ8KP8i3v0C&pg=PA1653&lpg=PA1653&dq=invaded+Siam+again+in+1785#v=onepage |title= The Greenwood Encyclopedia of International Relations: S-Z by Cathal J.

[[Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh]], the only member of the Nguy\u1ec5n family still alive, managed to escape across the river to Siam. While in exile Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh wished to retake Gia Dinh and push the Tay-Son rebels out.  He convinced the neutral King [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok]] of [[Siam]] to provide him with support troops and a small invasion force.\n\nIn mid-1784 Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh, with 50,000 [[Siam]]ese troops and 300 ships, moved through Cambodia, then East of Tonl\u00e9 Sap and penetrated the recently annexed provinces of Annam. 20,000 Siamese troops reached Kien Giang and another 30,000 landed in Chap Lap, as the Siamese advanced towards [[C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1]]. Later that year the Siamese captured the former Cambodian province of Gia Dinh where, it was claimed, they committed atrocities against the population of Viet settlers.\n\n[[Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7]] anticipating a move from the Siamese, had secretly positioned his infantry along the [[Ti\u1ec1n river]] near present-day [[M\u1ef9 Tho]], and on some islands in the middle, facing other troops on the northern banks with naval reinforcements on both sides of the infantry positions.\n\nOn the morning of 19 January Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 sent a small naval force, under a banner of truce, to lure the Siamese into his trap. After so many victories, the Siamese army and naval forces were confident of a surrender.  So, they went to the parley, unaware of the trap. Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7's troops dashed into the Siamese formation, slaughtered the unarmed emissaries and turned on the unprepared troops. The battle ended with a near annihilation of the Siamese force.  All the ships of the Siamese navy were destroyed and only 1,000 of the original expedition survived to escape back across the river into Siam.\n\n====Wars with Myanmar====\n{{main|Nine Armies War}}\nSoon King [[Bodawpaya]] of Myanmar started to pursue his ambitious campaigns to expand his dominions over Siam. The [[Burmese-Siamese War (1785\u20131786)]], also known in Siam as the \"Nine Armies War\" because the Myanmarese came in nine armies, thus broke out. The Myanmarese soldiers poured into Lanna and Northern Siam. Siamese forces, commanded by [[Kawila]], Prince of [[Lampang]], put up a brave fight and delayed the Myanmarese advance, all the while waiting for reinforcements from Bangkok. When [[Phitsanulok]] was captured, [[Anurak Devesh]] the ''Rear Palace'', and Rama I himself led Siamese forces to the north. The Siamese relieved Lampang from the Myanmarese siege.\n\nIn the south, Bodawpaya was waiting at [[Three Pagodas Pass|Chedi Sam Ong]] ready to attack. The Front Palace was ordered to lead his troops to the south and counter-attack the Myanmarese coming to [[Ranong]] through [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]]. He brought the Myanmarese to battle near [[Kanchanaburi]]. The Myanmarese also attacked Thalang ([[Phuket city|Phuket]]), where the governor had just died. His wife Chan, and her sister Mook, gathered the local people and successfully defended Thalang against the Myanmarese. Today, Chan and Mook are revered as heroines because of their opposition to the Myanmarese invasions. In their own lifetimes, Rama I bestowed on them the titles [[Thao Thep Kasattri and Thao Sri Sunthon]].\n\nThe Myanmarese proceeded to capture [[Songkhla]]. Upon hearing the news, the governors of [[Phatthalung]] fled. However, a monk named Phra Maha encouraged the citizens of the area to take up arms against the Myanmarese, his campaign was also successful. Phra Maha was later raised to the nobility by Rama I.\n\nAs his armies were destroyed, Bodawpaya retreated. The next year, he attacked again, this time constituting his troops as a single army. With this force Bodawpaya passed through the Three Pagoda Pass and settled in Ta Din Dang (Three Pagoda Pass.) The Front Palace marched the Siamese forces to face Bodawpaya. The fighting was very short and Bodawpaya was quickly defeated. This short war was called the \"[[Ta Din Dang campaign]]\".\n\n====Economics, culture and religion====\n[[File:Temple of the Emerald Buddha 2012.JPG|280px|thumb|right|[[Wat Phra Kaew]] seen from the Outer Court of [[Grand Palace]].]]\nChinese immigration increased during Rama I's reign, as he maintained Taksin's policy of allowing Chinese immigration to sustain the country's economy.

The Chakri family now controlled all branches of Siamese government \u2014 since Rama I had 42 children, his brother the Uparat had 43, and Rama II had 73, there was no shortage of royal princes to staff the bureaucracy, the army, the senior monk-hood, and the provincial governments. (Most of these were the children of concubines and thus not eligible to inherit the throne.) There was a confrontation with Vietnam, now becoming a major power in the region, over control of Cambodia in 1813, ending with the ''status quo ante'' restored. But during Rama II's reign Western influences again began to be felt in Siam.\n\nIn 1786 the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] occupied [[Penang]], and in 1819 they founded [[Singapore]]. Soon the British displaced the Dutch and Portuguese as the main Western economic and political influence in Siam. The British objected to the Siamese economic system, in which trading monopolies were held by royal princes and businesses were subject to arbitrary taxation. In 1821, the [[East India Company]]'s [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Lord Hastings]], then [[Governor-General of India]], sent company agent [[John Crawfurd#Siam mission|John Crawfurd on a mission]] to negotiate a new trade agreement with Siam \u2014 the first sign of an issue which was to dominate 19th century Siamese politics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7813138|title=The Crawford Papers \u2014 A Collection of Official Records relating to the Mission of Dr. John Crawfurd sent to Siam by the Government of India in the year 1821|date=1971|page=285|publisher=Cambridge Journals Online|work=Cambridge.org|accessdate=27 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927143143/http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7813138|archive-date=27 September 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Art and literature====\n[[File:Sunrise on Hat Saikaew, Koh Samet.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Phra Aphai Mani]] statue on [[Ko Samet]]]]\n{{see also|Sunthon Phu}}\n\nRama II was a lover of the arts and in particular the literary arts. He was an accomplished poet and anyone with the ability to write a refined piece of poetry would gain the favor of the king. This led to his being dubbed the \"poet king\". Due to his patronage, the poet Sunthon Phu was able to raise his [[Thai royal and noble titles|noble title]] from \"phrai\" to \"khun\" and later \"phra\". Sunthon \u2013 also known as the drunken writer \u2013 wrote numerous works, including the epic poem ''[[Phra Aphai Mani]]''.\n\nRama II rewrote much of the great literature from the reign of Rama I in a modern style. He is credited with writing a popular version of the Thai folk tale [[Ramakien]] and wrote a number of dance dramas such as [[Sang Thong]]. The king was an accomplished musician, playing and composing for the fiddle and introducing new instrumental techniques. He was also a sculptor and is said to have sculpted the face of the Niramitr Buddha in [[Wat Arun]]. Because of his artistic achievements, Rama II's birthday is now celebrated as National Artists' Day (Wan Sinlapin Haeng Chat), held in honor of artists who have contributed to the cultural heritage of the kingdom.\n\n===Consolidation (1824\u20131851) ===\n[[File:Map of the Rattanakosin Kingdom.svg|thumb|Zone of influence of the early Rattanakosin Kingdom (King Rama III)]]\n[[File:Rama III.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of King [[Nangklao]] (Rama III). The king fought massive wars against Cambodia and Vietnam.]]\n{{Main|Rama III}}\nRama II died in 1824 and was peacefully succeeded by his son Prince Jessadabondindra, who reigned as King Phra Nangklao, now known as [[Rama III]]. Rama II's younger son, [[Mongkut]], was \"encouraged\" to become a monk, removing him from politics.\n\nIn 1825 the British sent another mission to Bangkok led by [[East India Company]] emissary [[Henry Burney]]. They had by now annexed southern Myanmar and were thus Siam's neighbors to the west, and they were also extending their control over [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. The king was reluctant to give in to British demands,<!--What were the British demands?--> but his advisors warned him that Siam would meet the same fate as Myanmar unless the British were accommodated. In 1826, therefore, Siam concluded its first commercial treaty with a Western power, the [[Burney Treaty]]. Under the treaty, Siam agreed to establish a uniform taxation system, to reduce taxes on foreign trade, and to abolish some royal monopolies. As a result, Siam's trade increased rapidly, many more foreigners settled in Bangkok, and Western cultural influences began to spread. The kingdom became wealthier and its army better armed.\n\nA Lao rebellion led by [[Anouvong]] was defeated in 1827, following which Siam destroyed [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]], carried out massive forced population transfers from Laos to the more securely held area of [[Isan]], and divided the Lao mueang into smaller units to prevent another uprising. In 1842\u20131845 Siam waged a successful war with Vietnam, which tightened Siamese rule over Cambodia. Rama III's most visible legacy in Bangkok is the [[Wat Pho]] temple complex, which he enlarged and endowed with new temples.\n\nRama III regarded his brother Mongkut, who was said to be very popular among the British, as his heir, although as a monk, Mongkut could not openly assume this role. He used his long sojourn as a monk to acquire a Western education from French and American missionaries and British merchants, one of the first Siamese to do so. He learned English and Latin, and studied science and mathematics. The missionaries no doubt hoped to convert him to Christianity, but he was a strict Buddhist and a Siamese nationalist. He intended using this Western knowledge to strengthen and modernize Siam when he came to the throne, which he did in 1851.\n\nBy the 1840s it was obvious that Siamese independence was in danger from the colonial powers: this was shown dramatically by the British [[First Opium War]] with China in 1839\u20131842. In 1850 the British and Americans sent missions to Bangkok demanding the end of all restrictions on trade, the establishment of a Western-style government and immunity for their citizens from Siamese law ([[extraterritoriality]]). Rama III's government refused these demands, leaving his successor with a dangerous situation. Rama III reportedly said on his deathbed: \"[T]here will be no more wars with Myanmar and Vietnam. We will have them only with the West.\"<ref>{{Cite book |author=David K.

Rattanakosin's rulers welcomed the Chinese economic stimulus. Some ethnic Chinese merchants became court officials. Chinese culture was accepted and promoted. Many Chinese works were translated by ethnic Chinese court dignitaries. Siam's relationship with the Chinese Empire was strong. Rama I claimed his blood-relation with Taksin, worrying that the Chinese court might reject his approval.<!--??--> The relationship was guaranteed by the tributary missions, continuing until the [[Rama IV]]'s reign.\n\n===Enlightenment (1851\u20131868) ===\n[[File:Thomson, King Mongkut of Siam.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Photograph of King [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV) in western style uniform]]\n{{Main|Mongkut}}\n\n[[File:Flag of Siam (1855).svg|thumb|left|A white elephant, facing the hoist, centered on a red field. National ensign decreed by King [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV)|186x186px]]\n\nMongkut came to the throne as [[Rama IV]] in 1851, determined to prevent Siam from falling under colonial domination by forcing modernization on his reluctant subjects. But although he was in theory an absolute monarch, his power was limited. Having been a monk for 27 years, he lacked a base among the powerful royal princes, and did not have a modern state apparatus to carry out his wishes. His first attempts at reform, to establish a modern system of administration and to improve the status of debt-slaves and women, were frustrated.\n\nRama IV came to welcome Western intrusion in Siam. The king himself and his entourages were actively pro-British. This became evident in 1855 when a mission led by the Governor of [[Hong Kong]], [[John Bowring|Sir John Bowring]], arrived in Bangkok with demands for immediate changes, backed by the threat of force. The king readily agreed to demands for a new treaty, called the [[Bowring Treaty]], which restricted import duties to three percent, abolished royal trade monopolies, and granted extraterritoriality to British subjects. Other Western powers soon demanded and got similar concessions.\n\nThe king came to believe that the real threat to Siam came from the French, not the British. The British were interested in commercial advantage, the French in building a colonial empire. They occupied [[Saigon]] in 1859, and 1867 established a [[protectorate]] over southern Vietnam and eastern Cambodia. Rama IV hoped that the British would defend Siam if he gave them the economic concessions they demanded. In the next reign this would prove to be an illusion, but it is true that the British saw Siam as a useful buffer state between British Burma and [[French Indochina]].\n\n====Dhammayuttika Nikaya====\n[[File:Old_dhammayut_seal.jpg|upright|thumb|Old Dhammayuttika seal]]\n[[File:Mongkut in the Sangha.jpeg|upright|thumb|Mongkut observing precepts]]\n{{Main|Dhammayuttika Nikaya}}\n\nThe instrument of Mongkut's religious reformation was a new Buddhist order, the [[Dhammayuttika Nikaya]].

Rama V was the first Siamese king to have a full Western education, having been taught by a British governess, [[Anna Leonowens]] \u2013 whose place in Siamese history has been fictionalized as ''[[The King and I]]''.  At first Rama V's reign was dominated by the conservative regent, Chaophraya [[Si Suriyawongse]], but when the king came of age in 1873 he soon took control. He created a Privy Council and a Council of State, a formal court system and budget office. He announced that slavery would be gradually abolished and debt-bondage restricted.\n\n{{listen\n|filename=\n|title=\"Sansoen Phra Barami\" (Glorify his prestige)\n|description= \"[[Sansoen Phra Barami]]\"  ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e23\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e0d\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e23\u0e21\u0e35}}, lit: glorify his prestige) the [[Royal anthem]] of Siam, beginning in Rama V reign.\n}}\nAt first the princes and conservatives successfully resisted the king's reform agenda, but as the older generation was replaced by younger, Western-educated princes, resistance faded. He found powerful allies in his brothers Prince [[Chakkraphat]], whom he made finance minister, Prince [[Damrong Rajanubhab|Damrong]], who organized interior government and education, and his brother-in-law Prince [[Devrawongse]], foreign minister for 38 years. In 1887 Devrawonge visited Europe to study governmental systems. On his recommendation the king established cabinet government, an audit office, and an education department. The semi-autonomous status of Chiang Mai was ended and the army was reorganized and modernized.\n\n[[File:Map of Siam (territorial cessions).svg|thumb|Territorial claims abandoned by Siam in the late-19th and early-20th centuries]]\n\nIn 1893 French authorities in Indochina used a minor border dispute to provoke a crisis. French gunboats appeared at Bangkok and demanded the cession of Lao territories east of the [[Mekong]]. The king appealed to the British, but the British minister told the king to settle on whatever terms he could get. The king had no choice but to comply. Britain's only gesture was an agreement with France guaranteeing the integrity of the rest of Siam. In exchange, Siam had to give up its claim to the Tai-speaking Shan region of northeastern Myanmar to the British.\n\nThe French, however, continued to pressure Siam, and in 1906\u20131907 they manufactured another crisis. This time Siam had to concede French control of territory on the west bank of the Mekong opposite Luang Prabang and around [[Champasak (town)|Champasak]] in southern Laos, as well as western Cambodia. The British interceded to prevent more French pressure on Siam, but their price, in 1909 was the acceptance of British sovereignty over of [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], [[Perlis]], and [[Terengganu]] under [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909]].  All of these \"lost territories\" were on the fringes of the Siamese sphere of influence and had never been securely under their control, but being compelled to abandon all claim to them was a substantial humiliation to both king and country. Historian [[David K. Wyatt]] describes Chulalongkorn as \"broken in spirit and health\" following the 1893 crisis. It became the basis for the country's name change: with the loss of these territories ''Great Siam'' was no more, the king now ruled only the core \"Thai lands\".\n\nMeanwhile, reform continued unabated, transforming an absolute monarchy based on traditional relationships of power into a modern, centralized nation state. The process was increasingly under the control of Rama V's European-educated sons. Railways and telegraph lines united previously remote and semi-autonomous provinces. The currency was tied to the [[gold standard]] and a modern system of taxation replaced the arbitrary levies and corvee labor of the past. The biggest problem was the shortage of trained civil servants, and many foreigners had to be employed until new schools could be built and Siamese graduates produced. By 1910, when the king died, Siam had become a semi-modern country and continued to escape colonial rule.\n\n===From kingdom to modern nation (1910\u20131925) ===\n[[File:King Vajiravudh.jpg|thumb|upright|right|King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI), supported nationalism and modernization]]\n{{Main|Vajiravudh}}\n\nOne of Rama V's reforms was to introduce a Western-style law of royal succession, so in 1910 he was peacefully succeeded by his son Vajiravudh, who reigned as [[Rama VI]]. He had been educated at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]] military academy and at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and was an anglicized Edwardian gentleman. Indeed, one of Siam's problems was the widening gap between the Westernized royal family and upper aristocracy and the rest of the country. It took another 20 years for Western education to permeate the bureaucracy and the army.\n\nThere had been some political reform under Rama V, but the king was still an absolute monarch, who acted as the head of the cabinet and staffed all the agencies of the state with his own relatives. The new king [[Vajiravudh]], the son of Rama V, with his British education, knew that the rest of the \"new\" nation could not be excluded from government forever, but he had no faith in Western-style democracy. He applied his observations of the success of the British monarchy ruling India, appearing more in public and instituting more royal ceremonies. However Rama VI also carried on his father's modernization plan.\n\nBangkok became more and more the capital of the new nation of Siam. Rama VI's government began several nationwide development projects, despite financial hardship. New roads, bridges, [[State Railway of Thailand|railways]], [[Royal Thai Army#Army Medical Department|hospitals]] and schools mushroomed throughout the country with funds from Bangkok. Newly created \"viceroys\" were appointed to the newly restructured \"Region\", or ''[[Monthon]]'' (Circle), as king's agents supervising administrative affairs in the provinces.\n\nThe king established the ''Wild Tiger Corps'', or ''Kong Suea Pa'' ({{lang|th|\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e1b\u0e48\u0e32}}), a [[paramilitary]] organization of Siamese of \"good character\" united to further the nation's cause. He also created a junior branch which continues today as the [[National Scout Organization of Thailand]]. The king spent much time on the development of the movements as he saw it as an opportunity to create a bond between himself and loyal citizens. It was also a way to single out and honor his favorites. At first the Wild Tigers were drawn from the king's personal entourage (it is likely that many joined to gain favor with Vajiravudh), but an enthusiasm among the population arose later.\n\nOf the adult movement, a German observer wrote in September 1911: \"This is a troop of volunteers in black uniform, drilled in a more or less military fashion, but without weapons. The British [[Scouting|Scouts]] are apparently the paradigm for the Tiger Corps. In the whole country, at the most far-away places, units of this corps are being set up. One would hardly recognize the quiet and phlegmatic Siamese.\"\n\nThe paramilitary movement largely disappeared by 1927, but was revived and evolved into the [[Village Scouts|Volunteer Defense Corps]], also called the Village Scouts. ({{lang|th|\u0e25\u0e39\u0e01\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu:85/Thai/Islam_in_Thailand/140_southern_thailand___the_problem_with_paramilitaries.pdf|title=Southern Thailand: The Problem with Paramilitaries|publisher=Asia Report|date=23 October 2007|accessdate=27 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229092046/http://www.seasite.niu.edu:85/Thai/Islam_in_Thailand/140_southern_thailand___the_problem_with_paramilitaries.pdf|archivedate=29 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall]] in Bangkok]]\n\nVajiravudh's style of government differed from that of his father. In the beginning of the sixth reign, the king continued to use his father's team and there was no sudden break in the daily routine of government. Much of the running of daily affairs was therefore in the hands of experienced and competent men. To them and their staff Siam owed many progressive steps, such as the development of a national plan for the education of the whole populace, the setting up of clinics where free vaccination was given against smallpox, and the continuing expansion of railways.\n\nHowever, senior posts were gradually filled with members of the king's coterie when a vacancy occurred through death, retirement, or resignation. By 1915, half the cabinet consisted of new faces. Most notable was Chao Phraya Yomarat's presence and Prince Damrong's absence. He resigned from his post as Minister of the Interior officially because of ill health, but in actuality because of friction between himself and the king.\n\n====Educational reform====\nRama VI was the first king of Siam to set up a model of the constitution at Dusit Palace.  He wanted first to see how things could be managed under this Western system. He saw advantages in the system, and thought that Siam could move slowly towards it, but could not be adopted right away as the majority of the Siamese people did not have enough education to understand such a change just yet. In 1916 [[higher education]] came to Siam.

Siam's token participation in World War I secured it a seat at the [[Versailles Peace Conference]], and Foreign Minister [[Devawongse]] used this opportunity to argue for the repeal of  19th century treaties and the restoration of full Siamese sovereignty. The United States obliged in 1920, while France and Britain delayed until 1925. This victory gained the king some popularity, but it was soon undercut by discontent over other issues, such as his extravagance, which became more noticeable when a sharp postwar recession hit Siam in 1919. There was also concern that the king had no son. He obviously preferred the company of men to women (which did not offend Siamese sensibilities so much as undermine the stability of the monarchy due to the absence of heirs){{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}.\n\nThus when Rama VI died suddenly in 1925, aged only 44, the monarchy was in a weakened state. He was succeeded by his younger brother [[Prajadhipok]].\n\n===The end of absolute rule (1925\u20131932) ===\n[[File:King Prajadhipok portrait photograph.jpg|thumb|right|upright|King [[Prajadhipok]] (Rama VII), unexpectedly came to the throne in 1925.]]\n{{Main|Prajadhipok}}\n\nUnprepared for his new responsibilities, all Prajadhipok had in his favor was a lively intelligence, a charming diplomacy in his dealings with others, modesty and industrious willingness to learn, and the somewhat tarnished, but still potent, allure of the crown.\n\nUnlike his predecessor, the king diligently read virtually all state papers that came his way, from ministerial submissions to petitions by citizens. Within half a year, only three of Vajiravhud's twelve ministers stayed put, the rest having been replaced by members of the royal family. On the one hand, these appointments brought back men of talent and experience; on the other, it signaled a return to royal oligarchy. The king obviously wanted to demonstrate a clear break with the discredited sixth reign, and the choice of men to fill the top positions appeared to be guided largely by a wish to restore a Chulalongkorn-type government.\n\nThe legacy that Prajadhipok received from his elder brother were problems of the sort that had become chronic in the Sixth Reign. The most urgent of these was the economy: the finances of the state were in chaos, the budget heavily in deficit, and the royal accounts a nightmare of debts and questionable transactions. That the rest of the world was deep in the [[Great Depression]] following World War I did not help the situation either.\n\nVirtually the first act of Prajadipok as king entailed an institutional innovation intended to restore confidence in the monarchy and government, the creation of the [[Supreme Council of State of Siam|Supreme Council of the State]]. This privy council was made up of a number of experienced and extremely competent members of the royal family, including the longtime Minister of the Interior (and  Chulalongkorn's right-hand man) Prince Damrong. Gradually these princes arrogated increasing power by monopolizing all the main ministerial positions. Many of them felt it their duty to make amends for the mistakes of the previous reign, but it was not generally appreciated.\n\nWith the help of this council, the king managed to restore stability to the economy, although at a price of making a significant number of the civil servants redundant and cutting the salary of those that remained. This was obviously unpopular among the officials, and was one of the trigger events for the coup of 1932.\n\nPrajadhipok then turned his attention to the question of future politics in Siam. Inspired by the British example, the king wanted to allow the common people to have a say in the country's affair by the creation of a parliament. A proposed constitution was ordered to be drafted, but the king's wishes were rejected by his advisers, who felt that the population was not yet ready for democracy.\n\n====Revolution====\n[[File:Soldiers Siam 1932.gif|thumb|left|Group of soldiers standing on [[Royal Plaza (Thailand)|Royal Plaza]] waiting for orders during the [[Siamese Revolution of 1932|Revolution, 24 June 1932]]]]\n{{Main|Siamese revolution of 1932}}\n\nIn 1932, with the country deep in depression, the Supreme Council opted to introduce cuts in spending, including the military budget. The king foresaw that these policies might create discontent, especially in the army, and he therefore convened a special meeting of officials to explain why the cuts were necessary. In his address he stated the following, \"I myself know nothing at all about finances, and all I can do is listen to the opinions of others and choose the best... If I have made a mistake, I really deserve to be excused by the people of Siam.\"\n\nNo previous monarch of Siam had ever spoken in such terms. Many interpreted the speech not as Prajadhipok apparently intended, namely as a frank appeal for understanding and cooperation. They saw it as a sign of his weakness and evidence that a system which perpetuated the rule of fallible autocrats should be abolished. Serious political disturbances were threatened in the capital, and in April the king agreed to introduce a constitution under which he would share power with a prime minister. This was not enough for the radical elements in the army, however. On 24 June 1932, while the king was at the seaside, the Bangkok garrison mutinied and seized power, led by a group of 49 officers known as \"[[Khana Ratsadon]]\". Thus ended 800 years of [[Monarchy of Thailand#Origin|absolute monarchy]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Culture==\n===Clothing===\n{{Main|History of Thai clothing#Rattanakosin}}\n[[File:King Chulalongkorn wearing raj pattern.jpg|thumb|150px|Portrait of King Chulalongkorn wearing the ''raj pattern'' costume]]\n\n====Old Rattanakosin====\nAs same as Ayutthaya period, both Thai males and females dressed themselves with a loincloth wrap called ''[[Chang kben|chong kraben]]''.

The kingdom was founded by [[Rama I]] of the [[Chakri Dynasty|Chakri]]. The first half of this period was characterized by the consolidation of the kingdom's power and was punctuated by periodic conflicts with [[Myanmar]], [[Vietnam]] and Laos. The second period was one of engagements with the [[colonialism|colonial]] powers of Britain and France in which Siam remained the only [[Southeast Asia]]n state to maintain its independence.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/thailand/history-rattanakosin.htm\n |title        = Rattanakosin Period (1782 -present)\n |publisher    = GlobalSecurity.org\n |accessdate   = 1 November 2015\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20151107223323/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/thailand/history-rattanakosin.htm\n |archive-date = 7 November 2015\n |url-status     = live\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n\nInternally the kingdom developed into a modern centralized [[nation state]] with borders defined by interactions with Western powers. Economic and social progress was made, marked by an increase in foreign trade, the abolition of [[slavery]] and the expansion of formal education to the emerging [[middle class]]. However, the failure to implement substantial political reforms culminated in the [[1932 revolution]] and the abandonment of absolute monarchy in favor of a constitutional monarchy.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Chao Phraya Chakri, later Phutthayotfa Chulalok or [[Rama I]].]]\n[[File:Bangkok (early Rattanakosin) map.svg|thumb|300px|right|Map of [[Bangkok]] in the early Rattanakosin period.]]\n[[File:Old Bangkok canals.gif|thumb|right|View of 19th-century Bangkok with the [[Wat Saket|Golden Mount]] in the background.|250px]]\n{{Main|History of Bangkok|Thonburi Kingdom}}\nIn 1767, after dominating Southeast Asia for almost four centuries, [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] was [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1765\u20131767)|brought down]] by invading Myanmarese armies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/576|title=Historic City of Ayutthaya|publisher=\u00a9 UNESCO World Heritage Center|accessdate=21 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023061657/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/576|archive-date=23 October 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDespite its complete defeat and subsequent occupation by the [[Konbaung dynasty]], Siam made a rapid recovery. The resistance to Myanmarese rule was led by a noble of [[Thai Chinese|Chinese descent]], [[Taksin]], a military leader. Initially based at [[Chanthaburi]] in the southeast, within a year, he had defeated the Myanmarese occupation army and reestablished a Siamese state with its capital at [[Thonburi]] on the west bank of the Chao Phraya, 20&nbsp;km from the sea. In 1768 he was crowned as Taksin. He re-united the [[central Thailand|central Thai]] heartlands under his rule, and in 1769 he also occupied western [[Cambodia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Thailand/History#ref509771|title=The Thon Buri and Early Bangkok periods|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=21 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121160210/http://www.britannica.com/place/Thailand/History#ref509771|archivedate=21 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHe then marched south and reestablished Siamese rule over the [[Malay Peninsula]] as far as [[Penang]] and [[Terengganu]]. Having secured his base in Siam, [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1775\u201376)|Taksin attacked the Myanmarese in the north in 1774]] and captured [[Chiang Mai]] in 1776, permanently uniting Siam and [[Lannathai|Lanna]]. Taksin's leading general in this campaign was [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok|Thong Duang]], known by the title ''Chaophraya'' or Lord Chakri was himself a descendant of [[Mon people]]. In 1778 Chakri led a Siamese army which captured [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]], also [[Kingdom of Luang Phrabang|Luang Phrabang]], a northern Lao kingdom submitted, and eventually established Siamese domination over Laotian kingdoms.\n\nDespite these successes, by 1779 Taksin was in political trouble at home. He seems to have developed a religious mania, alienating the powerful Buddhist monk-hood by claiming to be a ''[[Four stages of enlightenment#Stream-enterer|sotapanna]]'' or divine figure. He was also in troubles with the court officials, Chinese merchants, and missionaries. The foreign observers began to speculate that he would soon be overthrown. In 1782 Taksin sent his armies under Chakri, the future [[Rama (Kings of Thailand)|Rama]] I of Rattanakosin, to invade Cambodia, but while they were away a rebellion broke out in the area around the capital. The rebels, who had popular support, offered the throne to General Chakri, the 'supreme general'. Chakri who was on war duty marched back from Cambodia and deposed Taksin, who was purportedly 'secretly executed' shortly after.\n\nChakri ruled under the name Ramathibodi (he was posthumously given the name Phutthayotfa Chulalok), but is now generally known as [[Rama I]], first king of the later known [[Chakri dynasty]]. One of his first decisions was to move the capital across the river to the village of Bang Makok (meaning \"place of [[Spondias|olive plum]]s\").  The new capital was located on the [[Rattanakosin Island|island of Rattanakosin]], protected from attack by the river to the west and by a series of [[Khlong|canals]] to the north, east and south.

In 1792 the Siamese occupied [[Luang Prabang]] and brought most of Laos under indirect Siamese rule. Cambodia was also effectively ruled by Siam.

Later that year the Siamese captured the former Cambodian province of Gia Dinh where, it was claimed, they committed atrocities against the population of Viet settlers.\n\n[[Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7]] anticipating a move from the Siamese, had secretly positioned his infantry along the [[Ti\u1ec1n river]] near present-day [[M\u1ef9 Tho]], and on some islands in the middle, facing other troops on the northern banks with naval reinforcements on both sides of the infantry positions.\n\nOn the morning of 19 January Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 sent a small naval force, under a banner of truce, to lure the Siamese into his trap. After so many victories, the Siamese army and naval forces were confident of a surrender.  So, they went to the parley, unaware of the trap. Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7's troops dashed into the Siamese formation, slaughtered the unarmed emissaries and turned on the unprepared troops. The battle ended with a near annihilation of the Siamese force.  All the ships of the Siamese navy were destroyed and only 1,000 of the original expedition survived to escape back across the river into Siam.\n\n====Wars with Myanmar====\n{{main|Nine Armies War}}\nSoon King [[Bodawpaya]] of Myanmar started to pursue his ambitious campaigns to expand his dominions over Siam. The [[Burmese-Siamese War (1785\u20131786)]], also known in Siam as the \"Nine Armies War\" because the Myanmarese came in nine armies, thus broke out. The Myanmarese soldiers poured into Lanna and Northern Siam. Siamese forces, commanded by [[Kawila]], Prince of [[Lampang]], put up a brave fight and delayed the Myanmarese advance, all the while waiting for reinforcements from Bangkok. When [[Phitsanulok]] was captured, [[Anurak Devesh]] the ''Rear Palace'', and Rama I himself led Siamese forces to the north. The Siamese relieved Lampang from the Myanmarese siege.\n\nIn the south, Bodawpaya was waiting at [[Three Pagodas Pass|Chedi Sam Ong]] ready to attack. The Front Palace was ordered to lead his troops to the south and counter-attack the Myanmarese coming to [[Ranong]] through [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]]. He brought the Myanmarese to battle near [[Kanchanaburi]]. The Myanmarese also attacked Thalang ([[Phuket city|Phuket]]), where the governor had just died. His wife Chan, and her sister Mook, gathered the local people and successfully defended Thalang against the Myanmarese. Today, Chan and Mook are revered as heroines because of their opposition to the Myanmarese invasions. In their own lifetimes, Rama I bestowed on them the titles [[Thao Thep Kasattri and Thao Sri Sunthon]].\n\nThe Myanmarese proceeded to capture [[Songkhla]]. Upon hearing the news, the governors of [[Phatthalung]] fled. However, a monk named Phra Maha encouraged the citizens of the area to take up arms against the Myanmarese, his campaign was also successful. Phra Maha was later raised to the nobility by Rama I.\n\nAs his armies were destroyed, Bodawpaya retreated. The next year, he attacked again, this time constituting his troops as a single army. With this force Bodawpaya passed through the Three Pagoda Pass and settled in Ta Din Dang (Three Pagoda Pass.) The Front Palace marched the Siamese forces to face Bodawpaya. The fighting was very short and Bodawpaya was quickly defeated. This short war was called the \"[[Ta Din Dang campaign]]\".\n\n====Economics, culture and religion====\n[[File:Temple of the Emerald Buddha 2012.JPG|280px|thumb|right|[[Wat Phra Kaew]] seen from the Outer Court of [[Grand Palace]].]]\nChinese immigration increased during Rama I's reign, as he maintained Taksin's policy of allowing Chinese immigration to sustain the country's economy.

Monks had already dabbled in superstitions when he first came to power, and Rama I implemented a law which required a monk who wished to travel to another principality for further education to present a certificate bearing his personal particulars, which would establish a monk ''[[wikt:bona fides|bona fides]]'' and that he had been properly ordained.

The Chakri family now controlled all branches of Siamese government \u2014 since Rama I had 42 children, his brother the Uparat had 43, and Rama II had 73, there was no shortage of royal princes to staff the bureaucracy, the army, the senior monk-hood, and the provincial governments. (Most of these were the children of concubines and thus not eligible to inherit the throne.) There was a confrontation with Vietnam, now becoming a major power in the region, over control of Cambodia in 1813, ending with the ''status quo ante'' restored. But during Rama II's reign Western influences again began to be felt in Siam.\n\nIn 1786 the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] occupied [[Penang]], and in 1819 they founded [[Singapore]]. Soon the British displaced the Dutch and Portuguese as the main Western economic and political influence in Siam. The British objected to the Siamese economic system, in which trading monopolies were held by royal princes and businesses were subject to arbitrary taxation. In 1821, the [[East India Company]]'s [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Lord Hastings]], then [[Governor-General of India]], sent company agent [[John Crawfurd#Siam mission|John Crawfurd on a mission]] to negotiate a new trade agreement with Siam \u2014 the first sign of an issue which was to dominate 19th century Siamese politics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7813138|title=The Crawford Papers \u2014 A Collection of Official Records relating to the Mission of Dr. John Crawfurd sent to Siam by the Government of India in the year 1821|date=1971|page=285|publisher=Cambridge Journals Online|work=Cambridge.org|accessdate=27 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927143143/http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7813138|archive-date=27 September 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Art and literature====\n[[File:Sunrise on Hat Saikaew, Koh Samet.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Phra Aphai Mani]] statue on [[Ko Samet]]]]\n{{see also|Sunthon Phu}}\n\nRama II was a lover of the arts and in particular the literary arts. He was an accomplished poet and anyone with the ability to write a refined piece of poetry would gain the favor of the king. This led to his being dubbed the \"poet king\". Due to his patronage, the poet Sunthon Phu was able to raise his [[Thai royal and noble titles|noble title]] from \"phrai\" to \"khun\" and later \"phra\". Sunthon \u2013 also known as the drunken writer \u2013 wrote numerous works, including the epic poem ''[[Phra Aphai Mani]]''.\n\nRama II rewrote much of the great literature from the reign of Rama I in a modern style. He is credited with writing a popular version of the Thai folk tale [[Ramakien]] and wrote a number of dance dramas such as [[Sang Thong]]. The king was an accomplished musician, playing and composing for the fiddle and introducing new instrumental techniques. He was also a sculptor and is said to have sculpted the face of the Niramitr Buddha in [[Wat Arun]]. Because of his artistic achievements, Rama II's birthday is now celebrated as National Artists' Day (Wan Sinlapin Haeng Chat), held in honor of artists who have contributed to the cultural heritage of the kingdom.\n\n===Consolidation (1824\u20131851) ===\n[[File:Map of the Rattanakosin Kingdom.svg|thumb|Zone of influence of the early Rattanakosin Kingdom (King Rama III)]]\n[[File:Rama III.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of King [[Nangklao]] (Rama III). The king fought massive wars against Cambodia and Vietnam.]]\n{{Main|Rama III}}\nRama II died in 1824 and was peacefully succeeded by his son Prince Jessadabondindra, who reigned as King Phra Nangklao, now known as [[Rama III]]. Rama II's younger son, [[Mongkut]], was \"encouraged\" to become a monk, removing him from politics.\n\nIn 1825 the British sent another mission to Bangkok led by [[East India Company]] emissary [[Henry Burney]]. They had by now annexed southern Myanmar and were thus Siam's neighbors to the west, and they were also extending their control over [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. The king was reluctant to give in to British demands,<!--What were the British demands?--> but his advisors warned him that Siam would meet the same fate as Myanmar unless the British were accommodated. In 1826, therefore, Siam concluded its first commercial treaty with a Western power, the [[Burney Treaty]]. Under the treaty, Siam agreed to establish a uniform taxation system, to reduce taxes on foreign trade, and to abolish some royal monopolies. As a result, Siam's trade increased rapidly, many more foreigners settled in Bangkok, and Western cultural influences began to spread. The kingdom became wealthier and its army better armed.\n\nA Lao rebellion led by [[Anouvong]] was defeated in 1827, following which Siam destroyed [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]], carried out massive forced population transfers from Laos to the more securely held area of [[Isan]], and divided the Lao mueang into smaller units to prevent another uprising. In 1842\u20131845 Siam waged a successful war with Vietnam, which tightened Siamese rule over Cambodia. Rama III's most visible legacy in Bangkok is the [[Wat Pho]] temple complex, which he enlarged and endowed with new temples.\n\nRama III regarded his brother Mongkut, who was said to be very popular among the British, as his heir, although as a monk, Mongkut could not openly assume this role. He used his long sojourn as a monk to acquire a Western education from French and American missionaries and British merchants, one of the first Siamese to do so. He learned English and Latin, and studied science and mathematics. The missionaries no doubt hoped to convert him to Christianity, but he was a strict Buddhist and a Siamese nationalist. He intended using this Western knowledge to strengthen and modernize Siam when he came to the throne, which he did in 1851.\n\nBy the 1840s it was obvious that Siamese independence was in danger from the colonial powers: this was shown dramatically by the British [[First Opium War]] with China in 1839\u20131842. In 1850 the British and Americans sent missions to Bangkok demanding the end of all restrictions on trade, the establishment of a Western-style government and immunity for their citizens from Siamese law ([[extraterritoriality]]). Rama III's government refused these demands, leaving his successor with a dangerous situation. Rama III reportedly said on his deathbed: \"[T]here will be no more wars with Myanmar and Vietnam. We will have them only with the West.\"<ref>{{Cite book |author=David K.

Rattanakosin's rulers welcomed the Chinese economic stimulus. Some ethnic Chinese merchants became court officials. Chinese culture was accepted and promoted. Many Chinese works were translated by ethnic Chinese court dignitaries. Siam's relationship with the Chinese Empire was strong. Rama I claimed his blood-relation with Taksin, worrying that the Chinese court might reject his approval.<!--??--> The relationship was guaranteed by the tributary missions, continuing until the [[Rama IV]]'s reign.\n\n===Enlightenment (1851\u20131868) ===\n[[File:Thomson, King Mongkut of Siam.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Photograph of King [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV) in western style uniform]]\n{{Main|Mongkut}}\n\n[[File:Flag of Siam (1855).svg|thumb|left|A white elephant, facing the hoist, centered on a red field. National ensign decreed by King [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV)|186x186px]]\n\nMongkut came to the throne as [[Rama IV]] in 1851, determined to prevent Siam from falling under colonial domination by forcing modernization on his reluctant subjects. But although he was in theory an absolute monarch, his power was limited. Having been a monk for 27 years, he lacked a base among the powerful royal princes, and did not have a modern state apparatus to carry out his wishes. His first attempts at reform, to establish a modern system of administration and to improve the status of debt-slaves and women, were frustrated.\n\nRama IV came to welcome Western intrusion in Siam. The king himself and his entourages were actively pro-British. This became evident in 1855 when a mission led by the Governor of [[Hong Kong]], [[John Bowring|Sir John Bowring]], arrived in Bangkok with demands for immediate changes, backed by the threat of force. The king readily agreed to demands for a new treaty, called the [[Bowring Treaty]], which restricted import duties to three percent, abolished royal trade monopolies, and granted extraterritoriality to British subjects. Other Western powers soon demanded and got similar concessions.\n\nThe king came to believe that the real threat to Siam came from the French, not the British. The British were interested in commercial advantage, the French in building a colonial empire. They occupied [[Saigon]] in 1859, and 1867 established a [[protectorate]] over southern Vietnam and eastern Cambodia. Rama IV hoped that the British would defend Siam if he gave them the economic concessions they demanded. In the next reign this would prove to be an illusion, but it is true that the British saw Siam as a useful buffer state between British Burma and [[French Indochina]].\n\n====Dhammayuttika Nikaya====\n[[File:Old_dhammayut_seal.jpg|upright|thumb|Old Dhammayuttika seal]]\n[[File:Mongkut in the Sangha.jpeg|upright|thumb|Mongkut observing precepts]]\n{{Main|Dhammayuttika Nikaya}}\n\nThe instrument of Mongkut's religious reformation was a new Buddhist order, the [[Dhammayuttika Nikaya]].

Rama V was the first Siamese king to have a full Western education, having been taught by a British governess, [[Anna Leonowens]] \u2013 whose place in Siamese history has been fictionalized as ''[[The King and I]]''.  At first Rama V's reign was dominated by the conservative regent, Chaophraya [[Si Suriyawongse]], but when the king came of age in 1873 he soon took control. He created a Privy Council and a Council of State, a formal court system and budget office. He announced that slavery would be gradually abolished and debt-bondage restricted.\n\n{{listen\n|filename=\n|title=\"Sansoen Phra Barami\" (Glorify his prestige)\n|description= \"[[Sansoen Phra Barami]]\"  ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e23\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e0d\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e23\u0e21\u0e35}}, lit: glorify his prestige) the [[Royal anthem]] of Siam, beginning in Rama V reign.\n}}\nAt first the princes and conservatives successfully resisted the king's reform agenda, but as the older generation was replaced by younger, Western-educated princes, resistance faded. He found powerful allies in his brothers Prince [[Chakkraphat]], whom he made finance minister, Prince [[Damrong Rajanubhab|Damrong]], who organized interior government and education, and his brother-in-law Prince [[Devrawongse]], foreign minister for 38 years. In 1887 Devrawonge visited Europe to study governmental systems. On his recommendation the king established cabinet government, an audit office, and an education department. The semi-autonomous status of Chiang Mai was ended and the army was reorganized and modernized.\n\n[[File:Map of Siam (territorial cessions).svg|thumb|Territorial claims abandoned by Siam in the late-19th and early-20th centuries]]\n\nIn 1893 French authorities in Indochina used a minor border dispute to provoke a crisis. French gunboats appeared at Bangkok and demanded the cession of Lao territories east of the [[Mekong]]. The king appealed to the British, but the British minister told the king to settle on whatever terms he could get. The king had no choice but to comply. Britain's only gesture was an agreement with France guaranteeing the integrity of the rest of Siam. In exchange, Siam had to give up its claim to the Tai-speaking Shan region of northeastern Myanmar to the British.\n\nThe French, however, continued to pressure Siam, and in 1906\u20131907 they manufactured another crisis. This time Siam had to concede French control of territory on the west bank of the Mekong opposite Luang Prabang and around [[Champasak (town)|Champasak]] in southern Laos, as well as western Cambodia. The British interceded to prevent more French pressure on Siam, but their price, in 1909 was the acceptance of British sovereignty over of [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], [[Perlis]], and [[Terengganu]] under [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909]].  All of these \"lost territories\" were on the fringes of the Siamese sphere of influence and had never been securely under their control, but being compelled to abandon all claim to them was a substantial humiliation to both king and country. Historian [[David K. Wyatt]] describes Chulalongkorn as \"broken in spirit and health\" following the 1893 crisis. It became the basis for the country's name change: with the loss of these territories ''Great Siam'' was no more, the king now ruled only the core \"Thai lands\".\n\nMeanwhile, reform continued unabated, transforming an absolute monarchy based on traditional relationships of power into a modern, centralized nation state. The process was increasingly under the control of Rama V's European-educated sons. Railways and telegraph lines united previously remote and semi-autonomous provinces. The currency was tied to the [[gold standard]] and a modern system of taxation replaced the arbitrary levies and corvee labor of the past. The biggest problem was the shortage of trained civil servants, and many foreigners had to be employed until new schools could be built and Siamese graduates produced. By 1910, when the king died, Siam had become a semi-modern country and continued to escape colonial rule.\n\n===From kingdom to modern nation (1910\u20131925) ===\n[[File:King Vajiravudh.jpg|thumb|upright|right|King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI), supported nationalism and modernization]]\n{{Main|Vajiravudh}}\n\nOne of Rama V's reforms was to introduce a Western-style law of royal succession, so in 1910 he was peacefully succeeded by his son Vajiravudh, who reigned as [[Rama VI]]. He had been educated at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]] military academy and at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and was an anglicized Edwardian gentleman. Indeed, one of Siam's problems was the widening gap between the Westernized royal family and upper aristocracy and the rest of the country. It took another 20 years for Western education to permeate the bureaucracy and the army.\n\nThere had been some political reform under Rama V, but the king was still an absolute monarch, who acted as the head of the cabinet and staffed all the agencies of the state with his own relatives. The new king [[Vajiravudh]], the son of Rama V, with his British education, knew that the rest of the \"new\" nation could not be excluded from government forever, but he had no faith in Western-style democracy. He applied his observations of the success of the British monarchy ruling India, appearing more in public and instituting more royal ceremonies. However Rama VI also carried on his father's modernization plan.\n\nBangkok became more and more the capital of the new nation of Siam. Rama VI's government began several nationwide development projects, despite financial hardship. New roads, bridges, [[State Railway of Thailand|railways]], [[Royal Thai Army#Army Medical Department|hospitals]] and schools mushroomed throughout the country with funds from Bangkok. Newly created \"viceroys\" were appointed to the newly restructured \"Region\", or ''[[Monthon]]'' (Circle), as king's agents supervising administrative affairs in the provinces.\n\nThe king established the ''Wild Tiger Corps'', or ''Kong Suea Pa'' ({{lang|th|\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e1b\u0e48\u0e32}}), a [[paramilitary]] organization of Siamese of \"good character\" united to further the nation's cause. He also created a junior branch which continues today as the [[National Scout Organization of Thailand]]. The king spent much time on the development of the movements as he saw it as an opportunity to create a bond between himself and loyal citizens. It was also a way to single out and honor his favorites. At first the Wild Tigers were drawn from the king's personal entourage (it is likely that many joined to gain favor with Vajiravudh), but an enthusiasm among the population arose later.\n\nOf the adult movement, a German observer wrote in September 1911: \"This is a troop of volunteers in black uniform, drilled in a more or less military fashion, but without weapons. The British [[Scouting|Scouts]] are apparently the paradigm for the Tiger Corps. In the whole country, at the most far-away places, units of this corps are being set up. One would hardly recognize the quiet and phlegmatic Siamese.\"\n\nThe paramilitary movement largely disappeared by 1927, but was revived and evolved into the [[Village Scouts|Volunteer Defense Corps]], also called the Village Scouts. ({{lang|th|\u0e25\u0e39\u0e01\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu:85/Thai/Islam_in_Thailand/140_southern_thailand___the_problem_with_paramilitaries.pdf|title=Southern Thailand: The Problem with Paramilitaries|publisher=Asia Report|date=23 October 2007|accessdate=27 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229092046/http://www.seasite.niu.edu:85/Thai/Islam_in_Thailand/140_southern_thailand___the_problem_with_paramilitaries.pdf|archivedate=29 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall]] in Bangkok]]\n\nVajiravudh's style of government differed from that of his father. In the beginning of the sixth reign, the king continued to use his father's team and there was no sudden break in the daily routine of government. Much of the running of daily affairs was therefore in the hands of experienced and competent men. To them and their staff Siam owed many progressive steps, such as the development of a national plan for the education of the whole populace, the setting up of clinics where free vaccination was given against smallpox, and the continuing expansion of railways.\n\nHowever, senior posts were gradually filled with members of the king's coterie when a vacancy occurred through death, retirement, or resignation. By 1915, half the cabinet consisted of new faces. Most notable was Chao Phraya Yomarat's presence and Prince Damrong's absence. He resigned from his post as Minister of the Interior officially because of ill health, but in actuality because of friction between himself and the king.\n\n====Educational reform====\nRama VI was the first king of Siam to set up a model of the constitution at Dusit Palace.  He wanted first to see how things could be managed under this Western system. He saw advantages in the system, and thought that Siam could move slowly towards it, but could not be adopted right away as the majority of the Siamese people did not have enough education to understand such a change just yet. In 1916 [[higher education]] came to Siam. Rama VI set up [[Vajiravudh College]], modeled after the British [[Eton College]], as well as the first Thai university, [[Chulalongkorn University]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Bing Soravij BhiromBhakdi|url=http://www.soravij.com/royalty/rama6/rama6.html|title=Rama VI of the Chakri Dynasty|publisher=The Siamese Collection|accessdate=18 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027093258/http://www.soravij.com/royalty/rama6/rama6.html|archive-date=27 October 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> modeled after [[Oxbridge]].\n\n<gallery class=\"central\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Vajiravudh College, Thailand, main school building.jpg|Vajiramonkut Building, [[Vajiravudh College]].\nFile:\u0e27\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e23\u0e32\u0e27\u0e38\u0e18\u0e27\u0e34\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e25\u0e31\u0e22 \u0e40\u0e02\u0e15\u0e14\u0e38\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e15 \u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23 (4).JPG|Vajiravudh College.\nFile:Maha Chulalongkorn B.jpg|Maha Chulalongkorn Building, [[Chulalongkorn University]].\n</gallery>\n\n====World War I====\n\n{{Main|Siam during World War I}}\n{| style=\"float:left; width:170px; border:solid #ccc 1px; margin:5px;\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[File:State Flag of Thailand (1916).svg|170px]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[File:Flag of Thailand.svg|170px]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 5px 0 5px; font-size:85%; line-height:14px;\"|King Rama VI by royal command changed the national flag of Siam in 1917 from the white elephant on a red background to a design with colors inspired by those of the Allies.<br>\n|}\n[[File:Firstworldwar.jpg|thumb|The Siamese Expeditionary Force during [[World War I]] in Paris, 1919.]]\n\nIn 1917 Siam declared war on [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], mainly to curry favor with the British and the French. Siam's token participation in World War I secured it a seat at the [[Versailles Peace Conference]], and Foreign Minister [[Devawongse]] used this opportunity to argue for the repeal of  19th century treaties and the restoration of full Siamese sovereignty. The United States obliged in 1920, while France and Britain delayed until 1925. This victory gained the king some popularity, but it was soon undercut by discontent over other issues, such as his extravagance, which became more noticeable when a sharp postwar recession hit Siam in 1919. There was also concern that the king had no son. He obviously preferred the company of men to women (which did not offend Siamese sensibilities so much as undermine the stability of the monarchy due to the absence of heirs){{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}.\n\nThus when Rama VI died suddenly in 1925, aged only 44, the monarchy was in a weakened state. He was succeeded by his younger brother [[Prajadhipok]].\n\n===The end of absolute rule (1925\u20131932) ===\n[[File:King Prajadhipok portrait photograph.jpg|thumb|right|upright|King [[Prajadhipok]] (Rama VII), unexpectedly came to the throne in 1925.]]\n{{Main|Prajadhipok}}\n\nUnprepared for his new responsibilities, all Prajadhipok had in his favor was a lively intelligence, a charming diplomacy in his dealings with others, modesty and industrious willingness to learn, and the somewhat tarnished, but still potent, allure of the crown.\n\nUnlike his predecessor, the king diligently read virtually all state papers that came his way, from ministerial submissions to petitions by citizens. Within half a year, only three of Vajiravhud's twelve ministers stayed put, the rest having been replaced by members of the royal family. On the one hand, these appointments brought back men of talent and experience; on the other, it signaled a return to royal oligarchy. The king obviously wanted to demonstrate a clear break with the discredited sixth reign, and the choice of men to fill the top positions appeared to be guided largely by a wish to restore a Chulalongkorn-type government.\n\nThe legacy that Prajadhipok received from his elder brother were problems of the sort that had become chronic in the Sixth Reign. The most urgent of these was the economy: the finances of the state were in chaos, the budget heavily in deficit, and the royal accounts a nightmare of debts and questionable transactions. That the rest of the world was deep in the [[Great Depression]] following World War I did not help the situation either.\n\nVirtually the first act of Prajadipok as king entailed an institutional innovation intended to restore confidence in the monarchy and government, the creation of the [[Supreme Council of State of Siam|Supreme Council of the State]]. This privy council was made up of a number of experienced and extremely competent members of the royal family, including the longtime Minister of the Interior (and  Chulalongkorn's right-hand man) Prince Damrong. Gradually these princes arrogated increasing power by monopolizing all the main ministerial positions. Many of them felt it their duty to make amends for the mistakes of the previous reign, but it was not generally appreciated.\n\nWith the help of this council, the king managed to restore stability to the economy, although at a price of making a significant number of the civil servants redundant and cutting the salary of those that remained. This was obviously unpopular among the officials, and was one of the trigger events for the coup of 1932.\n\nPrajadhipok then turned his attention to the question of future politics in Siam. Inspired by the British example, the king wanted to allow the common people to have a say in the country's affair by the creation of a parliament. A proposed constitution was ordered to be drafted, but the king's wishes were rejected by his advisers, who felt that the population was not yet ready for democracy.\n\n====Revolution====\n[[File:Soldiers Siam 1932.gif|thumb|left|Group of soldiers standing on [[Royal Plaza (Thailand)|Royal Plaza]] waiting for orders during the [[Siamese Revolution of 1932|Revolution, 24 June 1932]]]]\n{{Main|Siamese revolution of 1932}}\n\nIn 1932, with the country deep in depression, the Supreme Council opted to introduce cuts in spending, including the military budget. The king foresaw that these policies might create discontent, especially in the army, and he therefore convened a special meeting of officials to explain why the cuts were necessary. In his address he stated the following, \"I myself know nothing at all about finances, and all I can do is listen to the opinions of others and choose the best... If I have made a mistake, I really deserve to be excused by the people of Siam.\"\n\nNo previous monarch of Siam had ever spoken in such terms. Many interpreted the speech not as Prajadhipok apparently intended, namely as a frank appeal for understanding and cooperation. They saw it as a sign of his weakness and evidence that a system which perpetuated the rule of fallible autocrats should be abolished. Serious political disturbances were threatened in the capital, and in April the king agreed to introduce a constitution under which he would share power with a prime minister. This was not enough for the radical elements in the army, however. On 24 June 1932, while the king was at the seaside, the Bangkok garrison mutinied and seized power, led by a group of 49 officers known as \"[[Khana Ratsadon]]\". Thus ended 800 years of [[Monarchy of Thailand#Origin|absolute monarchy]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Culture==\n===Clothing===\n{{Main|History of Thai clothing#Rattanakosin}}\n[[File:King Chulalongkorn wearing raj pattern.jpg|thumb|150px|Portrait of King Chulalongkorn wearing the ''raj pattern'' costume]]\n\n====Old Rattanakosin====\nAs same as Ayutthaya period, both Thai males and females dressed themselves with a loincloth wrap called ''[[Chang kben|chong kraben]]''.

It was incorporated on January 23, 1956, from the annexation of Centerville, Niles, Irvington, [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 (California)|Mission San Jos\u00e9]], and Warm Springs.<ref name=\"Fremont 1989\">{{cite book |last1=Oral History Associates, Sausalito, California |title=City of Fremont: The first thirty years, history of growth |date=1989 |publisher=The Mission Peak Heritage Foundation |edition=LC 89-60547}}</ref> The city is named after [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]], an American explorer and former US Senator and [[Military Governor of California]].\n\nLocated in the [[East Bay]] region of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], Fremont has a rapidly-growing population of around 230,000.<ref name=popest>{{cite web| url=http://www.fremont.gov/index.aspx?NID=184| title= Demographics| publisher= City of Fremont| accessdate= October 7, 2014}}</ref> It is one of the largest cities by land area and the fourth most populous [[List of cities and towns in the San Francisco Bay Area|city in the San Francisco Bay Area]], behind [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]. It directly borders and is the closest [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] city to [[Silicon Valley]] as formally defined, and is thus often associated with it. The city has an extensive and rapidly expanding base of both tech industry and workers.\n\nThe area consisting of Fremont and the cities of [[Newark, California|Newark]] and [[Union City, California|Union City]] is known collectively as the Tri-City Area; different from the adjacent [[Tri-Valley]] area encompassing [[Pleasanton, California|Pleasanton]], [[Dublin, California|Dublin]], and [[Livermore, California|Livermore]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe recorded history of the Fremont area began on June 6, 1795, when [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 (California)|Mission San Jos\u00e9]] was founded by the Spaniard Father [[Fermin de Lasuen]]. The Mission was established at the site of the [[Ohlone]] village of Oroysom. On their second day in the area, the Mission party killed a [[grizzly bear]] in [[Niles Canyon]]. The first English-speaking visitor to Fremont was the renowned trapper and explorer [[Jedediah Smith]] in 1827. The Mission prospered, eventually reaching a population of 1,887 inhabitants in 1831. The influence of the missionaries declined after 1834, when the Mexican government enacted [[secularization]].\n\n[[File:Vallejo home site memorial plaque.jpg|thumb|left|Vallejo Home Site (1839-1890) memorial plaque]]\n[[Mariano Vallejo#Family life|Jos\u00e9 de Jesus Vallejo]], brother of [[Mariano Vallejo]], was the grantee of the [[Rancho Arroyo de la Alameda]] [[Ranchos of California|Mexican land grant]]. His family was influential in the Fremont area in the late colonial era and owned and built a [[Vallejo Flour Mill|flour mill]] at the mouth of [[Niles Canyon]].<ref name=chl>{{cite web|title=Alameda County|url=http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=21388|work=California Historical Landmarks|publisher=State of California Office of Historic Preservation|accessdate= May 6, 2011}}</ref> In 1846 the town's namesake [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] led a military expedition to map a trail through [[Mission Pass (Alameda County)|Mission Pass]] for reaching the Pacific coast and to take possession of California from Mexico for the United States.\n\nThe Fremont area grew rapidly at the time of the [[California Gold Rush]].  A town called Mission San Jos\u00e9 grew up around the old mission, with its own post office from 1850.   Agriculture dominated the economy with grapes, nursery plants and olives as leading crops. In 1868 the 6.8-magnitude [[1868 Hayward earthquake|Hayward earthquake]] on the [[Hayward Fault]] collapsed buildings throughout the Fremont area, ruining Mission San Jos\u00e9 and its outbuildings. Until the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] caused its destruction, the Fremont area's Palmdale Winery was the largest in California. The ruins of the Palmdale Winery are still visible near the Five Corners in Irvington.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museumoflocalhistory.org/pages/wineries.htm |title=Jill M. Singleton.

[[Charlie Chaplin]] filmed several movies in the Fremont area, most notably ''[[The Tramp (film)|The Tramp]]''.\n\n===Incorporation===\nFremont was incorporated in 1956 under the leadership of [[Wally Pond]], chair of the incorporation committee, when five towns in the area, Irvington, Centerville, Mission San Jos\u00e9, Niles, and Warm Springs, came together to form a city.<ref>http://www.fremont.gov/DocumentView.aspx?DID=837</ref> Glenmoor Gardens, the largest subdivision in Fremont, was under construction in the area, by developers Ralph E. Cotter, Jr., James R. Meyer, civil engineer Fred T. Duvall, and contractors James L. Reeder, and Robert H. Reeder. When the Glenmoor Gardens Homeowners Association (GGHA) was incorporated, in March 1953, there were no more than 75 houses in the subdivision. It was probably the first such organization in the Fremont area; in its scope and structure.

These towns were annexed into a single new, incorporated city called Fremont in 1956. Six decades later, these places have greatly expanded, are no longer separate communities, and are considered districts or community plan areas of the City of Fremont. The town of [[Newark, California|Newark]] was originally slated to join the annex but ultimately its voters declined; Newark became its own incorporated city in 1955.  Since incorporation, Fremont has created six  more districts, which it calls \"community plan areas\" for planning purposes. These include Central, North Fremont, South Fremont, and Bayside. The two other districts, Baylands and the Hill Areas, are primarily open space.<ref name=\"general_plan_2030_ch4\">{{cite book | chapter-url=http://www.fremont.gov/DocumentView.aspx?DID=4667 | chapter-format=PDF | chapter=Chapter 4: Community Character | title= General Plan 2030 Working Draft | publisher=City of Fremont, California | date=November 2010 | accessdate=November 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Centerville District===<!-- This section is linked from Centerville -->\nCenterville was the main town in [[Washington Township, Alameda County, California|Washington Township]]. Centerville is located at {{Coord|37|33|15|N|121|59|57|W|}}. It lies at an elevation of 52 feet (16 m). Centerville was started by George Lloyd who started selling cold beer to stage passengers from a tent in 1850.<ref name=CGN615>{{California's Geographic Names|615}}</ref> Capt. George Bond set up a general store and the name Centerville was chosen.<ref name=CGN615 /> The post office opened Centreville post office in 1855 and changed the spelling to Centerville in 1893.<ref name=CGN615 /> The [[Centerville Pioneer Cemetery]] contains the burial places of many of the city's founding pioneers.\n\nCenterville can be traced back to its native American roots. Spanish, Mexican, Italian, Portuguese and Swiss (Swiss Park), peoples were among the early settlers that contributed greatly to the growth Centerville. Most of Centerville was and still is [[Catholic]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nEarly Centerville was a quiet farming community, which consisted of large Spanish land grants divided into smaller farms. The Freitas Ranch on Thornton Ave was probably the largest of the working farms. There were acres of apricot along with other fruit and nut orchards and large fields of various types of fresh produce.<ref>{{cite book | last =Holmes | first =Philip | title = Centerville, Fremont | series = Images of America| publisher = Arcadia Publishing| isbn= 978-0738581774  | year =2011 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Centerville, California.

Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] issued [[Executive Order 9066]], which authorized military commanders to exclude \"any or all persons\" from certain areas in the name of national defense, the [[Western Defense Command]] began ordering Japanese Americans living on the West Coast to present themselves for \"evacuation\" from the newly created military zones.  This included many Centerville farming families.\n\nCenterville was also a main stop for the early railways. This gave the local farmers a way to quickly get their produce to market. With the access to railway service there was once a large cannery on Baine Ave. west of Fremont Ave. (now Peralta) next to the tracks. In 1959, the cannery was destroyed in the largest fire in Fremont's history.<ref>{{cite web| title = History of the Fremont Fire Department| url =https://www.fremont.gov/DocumentCenter/Home/View/733| website =fremont.gov| date = | accessdate = September 23, 2015 }}</ref> The fire lasted for two days, and effectively put an end to what had been the largest employer in Centerville at the time.

Most of the early housing stood along Fremont Blvd from Decoto Road south to Washington High school, along Thornton Ave from Fremont Blvd west to the Newark city border, and along Peralta Blvd from Fremont Blvd to Niles.\n\nFor city planning purposes, Centerville was enlarged to encompass most of the north central residential section of Fremont, from Mowry Ave to Decoto Rd, from [[Interstate 880 (California)|I-880]] to the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] line. This Centerville community plan area includes the sprawling subdivisions, developed in the 1950s and 1960s, of [[Glenmoor Gardens]], bounded by Central Avenue, Fremont Boulevard, Mowry Avenue, and the I-880 freeway. and the Cabrillo Park subdivision bound by Thornton Ave, Fremont Blvd, Decoto Road and the I-880 freeway.

It also has two junior high schools, Centerville Junior High School and Thornton Junior High School, which now stands on the old main site of the Freitas ranch.\n\n===Niles District===\n[[File:Niles-Artwalk-2005.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Niles Art Walk 2005]]\nThe town is physically divided from other parts of Fremont and neighboring Union City by [[Mission Boulevard (East Bay, California)|Mission Boulevard]] ([[California State Route 238|State Route 238]]) to the east and north, Alameda Creek to the south, [[Union Pacific Railroad]] to the west and southeast, and the Quarry Lakes to the southwest. The hills of Niles are lower than those of the area south of the Alameda Creek in Mission San Jose. Old Town Niles features its own library, post office, and silent movie theater as well as a large number of antique and craft stores. Niles is located at {{Coord|37|34|44|N|121|58|40|W|name=Niles District}}. It lies at an elevation of 112 feet (34 m).\n\nThe community, once called [[Vallejo Flour Mill|Vallejo Mills]], got its name from the [[Central Pacific Railroad]]'s Niles depot, built in 1870 as part of the [[First transcontinental railroad]] and named after their railroad attorney and stockholder [[Addison Niles]], who became associate justice on the [[California Supreme Court]] two years later.<ref name=CGN672>{{California's Geographic Names|672}}</ref> A post office was opened at Niles in 1873.<ref name=CGN672 />.\n\nNiles was the home of one of the first West Coast motion picture companies, [[Essanay Studios]]. [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Broncho Billy Anderson]] filmed some of their most famous silent movies in Niles. Scenic [[Niles Canyon]] stretches between Niles and [[Sunol, California|Sunol]]. The nonprofit [[Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum]] offers both artifacts of Niles' early years and each Saturday evening, screenings of early-twentieth-century silent films, many of which were filmed locally.\n\nThe [[Niles Canyon Railway]] runs along [[Alameda Creek]] in [[Niles Canyon]] and carries passengers on weekend excursions, including a holiday \"train of lights\", which is extremely popular&nbsp;\u2013 tickets for these trains typically sell out by early October. The Niles Canyon Railroad has a small but well-maintained collection of historic rail stock.\n\nPart of historic Niles is Mayhew Spring, also known as Mayhew's Sulphur Spring, which was located {{convert|600|ft|m}} north of the Niles railroad depot.<ref name=CGN672 /> The facility was owned by H.A. Meyhew.<ref name=CGN672 />\nThe coast-to-coast completion of the Transcontinental Railroad is reported to have occurred in nearby Niles Canyon. In September 1869, four months after the famous golden spike ceremony at Promontory Summit, Utah, the Central Pacific Railroad completed the transcontinental rail link between Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay, finishing the track through the canyon. The Central Pacific had acquired the Western Pacific and other local railroads and built track to connect them at a waterfront terminal at Alameda Point.\n\nAlso part of Niles is Niles Junction on the [[Western Pacific Railroad]],<ref name=CGN672 /> located at {{Coord|37|34|35|N|121|58|17|W|name=Niles Junction WPRR}} and situated at an elevation of {{Convert|79|ft|m|abbr=on}}.\n\nOf special note is the annual antique fair and [[flea market]] which takes place on the last Sunday in August. The entire town turns out with things to sell as early as Saturday morning, with bargain hunters from the Bay Area and beyond visiting in search of bargains. Niles is also home to the [[Gurdwara Sahib of Fremont|Fremont Gurdwara]], which serves the large American [[Sikh]] community of Fremont as a religious shrine open to not only Sikhs but also everyone, regardless of their caste and religion.\n\n===Irvington District===\nThe Irvington District area has cycled through many name changes over time. Shortly after the US Civil war, an emancipated black man traveled from the southern United States to California, reputedly in search of a fortune. The former slave noticed the traffic at the crossroads of what is today the \"Five Corners\" intersection in Fremont; the transcontinental railroad passed through this region, bringing many passers-by. Realizing a financial opportunity, he constructed the first building at the cross roads, a tavern with an inn known as Dave's Saloon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoflocalhistory.org/documents/African-Amer-UnionCity.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627032718/http://www.museumoflocalhistory.org/documents/African-Amer-UnionCity.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-27 }}</ref> This corner, today the intersection of Fremont and Washington Boulevards, Union and Bay Streets, is known as \"Five Corners\" or Irvington Square. Irvington Square's marker, Irvington Plaza park, is located at {{Coord|37|31|22|N|121|58|18|W|name=Irvington Square}}.  The inn and several of the other original buildings were demolished by the city of Fremont in the early 1980s.\n\nIn 1871 [[Washington College (California)|Washington College]], one of the first industrial educational institutions in California, was established in Washington township near the crossroads. As a result, the US Postal Service established a post office called Washington Corners at the college in 1870, which became the name of the settlement on the 1878 [[Alameda County]] map of Washington Township.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nIn 1884, realizing the need for a proper town name, local inhabitants selected the name of Irving. The name was chosen in honor of Judge Irving, the local traveling circuit judge of the time. Later, when the railroad came through the area, the published train schedule pamphlets erroneously listed the Irving train depot as \"Irvington.\" The town petitioned the railroad about the error. The railroad company notified the town that it was too costly for them to replace the train schedule pamphlets (over $100,000); and in 1887 following the recommendation, the people of Irving changed the town name to Irvington.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe Irvington district has two main neighborhoods: Irvington Woods and the Irvington Square. The neighborhood is ethnically mixed and is primarily working class.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.govwarrantsearch.org/california-ca/fremont|title=Fremont {{!}} Warrant Search|website=www.govwarrantsearch.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}</ref> For city planning purposes, the Irvington area was enlarged to encompass most of the south central residential section of Fremont, from [[Auto Mall]] Parkway to Mowry Avenue, from I-880 to roughly the BART line (excluding the Central District described below). This Irvington community plan area includes the Sundale neighborhood, the South Sundale neighborhood, 28 Palms, Blacow, and Grimmer subdivisions. The area is served by three high schools: [[Irvington High School (Fremont, California)|Irvington High School]], [[Robertson High School (Fremont, California)|Robertson High School]], and [[John F. Kennedy High School (Fremont, California)|John F. Kennedy High School]].\n\n===Mission San Jose District===\nAt the time of the California Gold Rush, a boom town grew up around the old Mission, to equip and transport [[California Gold Rush#Forty-niners|49ers]] overland to the gold fields.  A post office was opened at Mission San Jose in 1850.<ref name=CGN665>{{California's Geographic Names|665}}</ref>\n\nThe district, like Niles, is surrounded by hills. The hills are higher and steeper than Niles, with the highest points being on the [[Mission Peak|Mission Ridge]]. Mission San Jose district lies close to the northern two peaks, [[Mission Peak]] and [[Mount Allison]]. Mission Peak is very distinctive and is one of Fremont's emblems. These peaks go from 2,517 to {{convert|2604|ft|m|abbr=on}}, taller than [[Mount Tamalpais]], a great height for the San Francisco Bay Area. They see some deep snow occasionally.\n\nFremont's community college, [[Ohlone College]], is situated one block away from the mission and serves over 12,000 students.\n\nMission San Jose has the highest concentration of [[Asian American]]s in Fremont&nbsp;\u2013 over 50% of the population as of the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. The local high school is [[Mission San Jose High School]], ranked 67 in the nation by U.S. News & World Report. The median family income for the Mission San Jose area ([[ZIP code]] 94539) exceeded $114,595 in 2005. Owing to an influx of [[professionals]] and other affluent families seeking access to the top-performing local public schools, Mission San Jose's median home value reached $831,000 in 2006, earning the community a rank of 237 on [[Forbes]] magazine's list of the 500 most affluent communities in the United States.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/7/forbeslife-cx_07zip_94539_ZIP94539.html |title=#237 94539 |magazine=Forbes.com |date= September 13, 2007|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001 an attempt by community organizations in the Mission San Jose district to withdraw from the [[Fremont Unified School District]] caused state-wide controversy and led to accusations of racism from both sides. The attempt was prompted by a re-drawing of the school enrollment areas, under which some Mission San Jose residents would send their children to Horner Junior High and [[Irvington High School (Fremont, California)|Irvington High]] schools. The controversial effort to secede was dropped later that year. Fremont's public schools continue to rank among the best in California.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/05/17/EB49066.DTL |title=OF RACE AND PLACE / Little Asia / Fremont community largely made up of immigrants with means |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=May 17, 2002 |accessdate=September 9, 2010 | first=Rona | last=Marech}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4190129 |title=Immigrants Weigh Splitting from Calif.

It is located at {{Coord|37|29|14|N|121|55|45|W|}}, and lies at an elevation of 62 feet (19 m). Due to its proximity to the center of Silicon Valley, Warm Springs has attracted the headquarters of many high-tech companies including [[Nielsen Norman Group]], [[Lam Research]], [[Corsair Memory]] and [[Lexar]] of the US as well as foreign high-tech companies such as [[Elitegroup Computer Systems]], and [[Asus]].  The district is also home to [[blue-collar]] industry. The San Jose mission is also present.\n\nWarm Springs also serves as commercial center for the mainly residential Mission San Jose district, especially since the construction of [[Pacific Commons]], a large, modern regional shopping center. The Oakland Athletics talked about moving their stadium to this area. The large Asian population in Mission San Jose comes to Warm Springs for authentic Asian stores such as the [[99 Ranch]] & Marina Food supermarkets, as well as more traditional [[supermarket]]s such as [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]].

Fr\u00e9mont]], an American explorer and former US Senator and [[Military Governor of California]].\n\nLocated in the south of the [[East Bay]] region of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], Fremont has a rapidly-growing population of around 230,000.<ref name=popest>{{cite web| url=http://www.fremont.gov/index.aspx?NID=184| title= Demographics| publisher= City of Fremont| accessdate= October 7, 2014}}</ref> It is one of the largest cities by land area and the fourth most populous [[List of cities and towns in the San Francisco Bay Area|city in the San Francisco Bay Area]], behind [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]. It directly borders and is the closest [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] city to [[Silicon Valley]] as formally defined, and is thus often associated with it. The city has an extensive and rapidly expanding base of both tech industry and workers.\n\nThe area consisting of Fremont and the cities of [[Newark, California|Newark]] and [[Union City, California|Union City]] is known collectively as the Tri-City Area; different from the adjacent [[Tri-Valley]] area encompassing [[Pleasanton, California|Pleasanton]], [[Dublin, California|Dublin]], and [[Livermore, California|Livermore]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe recorded history of the Fremont area began on June 6, 1795, when [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 (California)|Mission San Jos\u00e9]] was founded by the Spaniard Father [[Fermin de Lasuen]]. The Mission was established at the site of the [[Ohlone]] village of Oroysom. On their second day in the area, the Mission party killed a [[grizzly bear]] in [[Niles Canyon]]. The first English-speaking visitor to Fremont was the renowned trapper and explorer [[Jedediah Smith]] in 1827. The Mission prospered, eventually reaching a population of 1,887 inhabitants in 1831. The influence of the missionaries declined after 1834, when the Mexican government enacted [[secularization]].\n\n[[File:Vallejo home site memorial plaque.jpg|thumb|left|Vallejo Home Site (1839-1890) memorial plaque]]\n[[Mariano Vallejo#Family life|Jos\u00e9 de Jesus Vallejo]], brother of [[Mariano Vallejo]], was the grantee of the [[Rancho Arroyo de la Alameda]] [[Ranchos of California|Mexican land grant]]. His family was influential in the Fremont area in the late colonial era and owned and built a [[Vallejo Flour Mill|flour mill]] at the mouth of [[Niles Canyon]].<ref name=chl>{{cite web|title=Alameda County|url=http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=21388|work=California Historical Landmarks|publisher=State of California Office of Historic Preservation|accessdate= May 6, 2011}}</ref> In 1846 the town's namesake [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] led a military expedition to map a trail through [[Mission Pass (Alameda County)|Mission Pass]] for reaching the Pacific coast and to take possession of California from Mexico for the United States.\n\nThe Fremont area grew rapidly at the time of the [[California Gold Rush]].  A town called Mission San Jos\u00e9 grew up around the old mission, with its own post office from 1850.   Agriculture dominated the economy with grapes, nursery plants and olives as leading crops. In 1868 the 6.8-magnitude [[1868 Hayward earthquake|Hayward earthquake]] on the [[Hayward Fault]] collapsed buildings throughout the Fremont area, ruining Mission San Jos\u00e9 and its outbuildings. Until the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] caused its destruction, the Fremont area's Palmdale Winery was the largest in California. The ruins of the Palmdale Winery are still visible near the Five Corners in Irvington.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museumoflocalhistory.org/pages/wineries.htm |title=Jill M. Singleton.

[[Charlie Chaplin]] filmed several movies in the Fremont area, most notably ''[[The Tramp (film)|The Tramp]]''.\n\n===Incorporation===\nFremont was incorporated in 1956 under the leadership of [[Wally Pond]], chair of the incorporation committee, when five towns in the area, Irvington, Centerville, Mission San Jos\u00e9, Niles, and Warm Springs, came together to form a city.<ref>http://www.fremont.gov/DocumentView.aspx?DID=837</ref> Glenmoor Gardens, the largest subdivision in Fremont, was under construction in the area, by developers Ralph E. Cotter, Jr., James R. Meyer, civil engineer Fred T. Duvall, and contractors James L. Reeder, and Robert H. Reeder. When the Glenmoor Gardens Homeowners Association (GGHA) was incorporated, in March 1953, there were no more than 75 houses in the subdivision. It was probably the first such organization in the Fremont area; in its scope and structure. The five-member board of directors (which included James Meyer and James Reeder) was set up to oversee a full range of services, from police and fire protection to street maintenance (which later became the purview of the city government).<ref>https://fremont.gov/documentcenter/view/25617</ref>\n\nFremont became more industrialized between 1953 and 1962. A boom in high-tech employment in the 1980s to the late 1990s, especially in the Warm Springs District, caused rapid development in the city and linked the city with the [[Silicon Valley]].

These towns were annexed into a single new, incorporated city called Fremont in 1956. Six decades later, these places have greatly expanded, are no longer separate communities, and are considered districts or community plan areas of the City of Fremont. The town of [[Newark, California|Newark]] was originally slated to join the annex but ultimately its voters declined; Newark became its own incorporated city in 1955.  Since incorporation, Fremont has created six  more districts, which it calls \"community plan areas\" for planning purposes. These include Central, North Fremont, South Fremont, and Bayside.

Spanish, Mexican, Italian, Portuguese and Swiss (Swiss Park), peoples were among the early settlers that contributed greatly to the growth Centerville. Most of Centerville was and still is [[Catholic]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nEarly Centerville was a quiet farming community, which consisted of large Spanish land grants divided into smaller farms. The Freitas Ranch on Thornton Ave was probably the largest of the working farms. There were acres of apricot along with other fruit and nut orchards and large fields of various types of fresh produce.<ref>{{cite book | last =Holmes | first =Philip | title = Centerville, Fremont | series = Images of America| publisher = Arcadia Publishing| isbn= 978-0738581774  | year =2011 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Centerville, California.

This included many Centerville farming families.\n\nCenterville was also a main stop for the early railways. This gave the local farmers a way to quickly get their produce to market. With the access to railway service there was once a large cannery on Baine Ave. west of Fremont Ave. (now Peralta) next to the tracks. In 1959, the cannery was destroyed in the largest fire in Fremont's history.<ref>{{cite web| title = History of the Fremont Fire Department| url =https://www.fremont.gov/DocumentCenter/Home/View/733| website =fremont.gov| date = | accessdate = September 23, 2015 }}</ref> The fire lasted for two days, and effectively put an end to what had been the largest employer in Centerville at the time.

It also has two junior high schools, Centerville Junior High School and Thornton Junior High School, which now stands on the old main site of the Freitas ranch.\n\n===Niles District===\n[[File:Niles-Artwalk-2005.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Niles Art Walk 2005]]\nThe town is physically divided from other parts of Fremont and neighboring Union City by [[Mission Boulevard (East Bay, California)|Mission Boulevard]] ([[California State Route 238|State Route 238]]) to the east and north, Alameda Creek to the south, [[Union Pacific Railroad]] to the west and southeast, and the Quarry Lakes to the southwest. The hills of Niles are lower than those of the area south of the Alameda Creek in Mission San Jose. Old Town Niles features its own library, post office, and silent movie theater as well as a large number of antique and craft stores. Niles is located at {{Coord|37|34|44|N|121|58|40|W|name=Niles District}}. It lies at an elevation of 112 feet (34 m).\n\nThe community, once called [[Vallejo Flour Mill|Vallejo Mills]], got its name from the [[Central Pacific Railroad]]'s Niles depot, built in 1870 as part of the [[First transcontinental railroad]] and named after their railroad attorney and stockholder [[Addison Niles]], who became associate justice on the [[California Supreme Court]] two years later.<ref name=CGN672>{{California's Geographic Names|672}}</ref> A post office was opened at Niles in 1873.<ref name=CGN672 />.\n\nNiles was the home of one of the first West Coast motion picture companies, [[Essanay Studios]]. [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Broncho Billy Anderson]] filmed some of their most famous silent movies in Niles. Scenic [[Niles Canyon]] stretches between Niles and [[Sunol, California|Sunol]]. The nonprofit [[Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum]] offers both artifacts of Niles' early years and each Saturday evening, screenings of early-twentieth-century silent films, many of which were filmed locally.\n\nThe [[Niles Canyon Railway]] runs along [[Alameda Creek]] in [[Niles Canyon]] and carries passengers on weekend excursions, including a holiday \"train of lights\", which is extremely popular&nbsp;\u2013 tickets for these trains typically sell out by early October. The Niles Canyon Railroad has a small but well-maintained collection of historic rail stock.\n\nPart of historic Niles is Mayhew Spring, also known as Mayhew's Sulphur Spring, which was located {{convert|600|ft|m}} north of the Niles railroad depot.<ref name=CGN672 /> The facility was owned by H.A. Meyhew.<ref name=CGN672 />\nThe coast-to-coast completion of the Transcontinental Railroad is reported to have occurred in nearby Niles Canyon. In September 1869, four months after the famous golden spike ceremony at Promontory Summit, Utah, the Central Pacific Railroad completed the transcontinental rail link between Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay, finishing the track through the canyon. The Central Pacific had acquired the Western Pacific and other local railroads and built track to connect them at a waterfront terminal at Alameda Point.\n\nAlso part of Niles is Niles Junction on the [[Western Pacific Railroad]],<ref name=CGN672 /> located at {{Coord|37|34|35|N|121|58|17|W|name=Niles Junction WPRR}} and situated at an elevation of {{Convert|79|ft|m|abbr=on}}.\n\nOf special note is the annual antique fair and [[flea market]] which takes place on the last Sunday in August. The entire town turns out with things to sell as early as Saturday morning, with bargain hunters from the Bay Area and beyond visiting in search of bargains. Niles is also home to the [[Gurdwara Sahib of Fremont|Fremont Gurdwara]], which serves the large American [[Sikh]] community of Fremont as a religious shrine open to not only Sikhs but also everyone, regardless of their caste and religion.\n\n===Irvington District===\nThe Irvington District area has cycled through many name changes over time. Shortly after the US Civil war, an emancipated black man traveled from the southern United States to California, reputedly in search of a fortune. The former slave noticed the traffic at the crossroads of what is today the \"Five Corners\" intersection in Fremont; the transcontinental railroad passed through this region, bringing many passers-by. Realizing a financial opportunity, he constructed the first building at the cross roads, a tavern with an inn known as Dave's Saloon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoflocalhistory.org/documents/African-Amer-UnionCity.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627032718/http://www.museumoflocalhistory.org/documents/African-Amer-UnionCity.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-27 }}</ref> This corner, today the intersection of Fremont and Washington Boulevards, Union and Bay Streets, is known as \"Five Corners\" or Irvington Square. Irvington Square's marker, Irvington Plaza park, is located at {{Coord|37|31|22|N|121|58|18|W|name=Irvington Square}}.  The inn and several of the other original buildings were demolished by the city of Fremont in the early 1980s.\n\nIn 1871 [[Washington College (California)|Washington College]], one of the first industrial educational institutions in California, was established in Washington township near the crossroads. As a result, the US Postal Service established a post office called Washington Corners at the college in 1870, which became the name of the settlement on the 1878 [[Alameda County]] map of Washington Township.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nIn 1884, realizing the need for a proper town name, local inhabitants selected the name of Irving. The name was chosen in honor of Judge Irving, the local traveling circuit judge of the time. Later, when the railroad came through the area, the published train schedule pamphlets erroneously listed the Irving train depot as \"Irvington.\" The town petitioned the railroad about the error. The railroad company notified the town that it was too costly for them to replace the train schedule pamphlets (over $100,000); and in 1887 following the recommendation, the people of Irving changed the town name to Irvington.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe Irvington district has two main neighborhoods: Irvington Woods and the Irvington Square. The neighborhood is ethnically mixed and is primarily working class.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.govwarrantsearch.org/california-ca/fremont|title=Fremont {{!}} Warrant Search|website=www.govwarrantsearch.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}</ref> For city planning purposes, the Irvington area was enlarged to encompass most of the south central residential section of Fremont, from [[Auto Mall]] Parkway to Mowry Avenue, from I-880 to roughly the BART line (excluding the Central District described below). This Irvington community plan area includes the Sundale neighborhood, the South Sundale neighborhood, 28 Palms, Blacow, and Grimmer subdivisions. The area is served by three high schools: [[Irvington High School (Fremont, California)|Irvington High School]], [[Robertson High School (Fremont, California)|Robertson High School]], and [[John F. Kennedy High School (Fremont, California)|John F. Kennedy High School]].\n\n===Mission San Jose District===\nAt the time of the California Gold Rush, a boom town grew up around the old Mission, to equip and transport [[California Gold Rush#Forty-niners|49ers]] overland to the gold fields.  A post office was opened at Mission San Jose in 1850.<ref name=CGN665>{{California's Geographic Names|665}}</ref>\n\nThe district, like Niles, is surrounded by hills. The hills are higher and steeper than Niles, with the highest points being on the [[Mission Peak|Mission Ridge]]. Mission San Jose district lies close to the northern two peaks, [[Mission Peak]] and [[Mount Allison]]. Mission Peak is very distinctive and is one of Fremont's emblems. These peaks go from 2,517 to {{convert|2604|ft|m|abbr=on}}, taller than [[Mount Tamalpais]], a great height for the San Francisco Bay Area. They see some deep snow occasionally.\n\nFremont's community college, [[Ohlone College]], is situated one block away from the mission and serves over 12,000 students.\n\nMission San Jose has the highest concentration of [[Asian American]]s in Fremont&nbsp;\u2013 over 50% of the population as of the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. The local high school is [[Mission San Jose High School]], ranked 67 in the nation by U.S. News & World Report. The median family income for the Mission San Jose area ([[ZIP code]] 94539) exceeded $114,595 in 2005. Owing to an influx of [[professionals]] and other affluent families seeking access to the top-performing local public schools, Mission San Jose's median home value reached $831,000 in 2006, earning the community a rank of 237 on [[Forbes]] magazine's list of the 500 most affluent communities in the United States.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/7/forbeslife-cx_07zip_94539_ZIP94539.html |title=#237 94539 |magazine=Forbes.com |date= September 13, 2007|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001 an attempt by community organizations in the Mission San Jose district to withdraw from the [[Fremont Unified School District]] caused state-wide controversy and led to accusations of racism from both sides. The attempt was prompted by a re-drawing of the school enrollment areas, under which some Mission San Jose residents would send their children to Horner Junior High and [[Irvington High School (Fremont, California)|Irvington High]] schools. The controversial effort to secede was dropped later that year. Fremont's public schools continue to rank among the best in California.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/05/17/EB49066.DTL |title=OF RACE AND PLACE / Little Asia / Fremont community largely made up of immigrants with means |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=May 17, 2002 |accessdate=September 9, 2010 | first=Rona | last=Marech}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4190129 |title=Immigrants Weigh Splitting from Calif.

It is located at {{Coord|37|29|14|N|121|55|45|W|}}, and lies at an elevation of 62 feet (19 m). Due to its proximity to the center of Silicon Valley, Warm Springs has attracted the headquarters of many high-tech companies including [[Nielsen Norman Group]], [[Lam Research]], [[Corsair Memory]] and [[Lexar]] of the US as well as foreign high-tech companies such as [[Elitegroup Computer Systems]], and [[Asus]].  The district is also home to [[blue-collar]] industry. The San Jose mission is also present.\n\nWarm Springs also serves as commercial center for the mainly residential Mission San Jose district, especially since the construction of [[Pacific Commons]], a large, modern regional shopping center.
