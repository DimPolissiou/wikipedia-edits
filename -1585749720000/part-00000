When occurring within spoken Sanskrit, the syllable is subject to the normal rules of [[sandhi]] in [[Sanskrit grammar]], however with the additional peculiarity that after preceding ''a'' or ''\u0101'', the ''au'' of ''aum''  does not form [[vriddhi]] (''au'') but [[guna]] (''o'') per [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]] 6.1.95 (i.e. 'om').\n\nIt is sometimes also written \u0913\u0969\u092e\u094d (''\u014d\u0304m'' {{IPA-sa|o\u02d0\u02d0m|}}), notably by [[Arya Samaj]], where \u0969 (i.e., the digit \"3\") is ''[[Pluti|pluta]]'' (\"three times as long\"), [[pluti|indicating a length]] of three [[morae]] (that is, the time it takes to say three syllables) \u2014 an [[vowel length|overlong]] [[nasalised]] [[close-mid back rounded vowel]].\n\nThe ''Om'' symbol [[File:Aum.svg|20px]]  is a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] in [[Devanagari]], combining \u0913 (''{{IAST|au}}'') and [[chandrabindu]] ([[\u0901]], ''{{IAST|\u1e43}}''). In [[Unicode]], the symbol is encoded at {{unichar|0950|Devanagari OM}} and at {{unichar|1f549|OM Symbol}} (\"generic symbol independent of Devanagari font\").\n\nThe ''Om'' or ''Aum'' symbol is found on ancient coins, in regional scripts. In [[Sri Lanka]], [[Anuradhapura Kingdom|Anuradhapura era]] coins (dated from the 1st to 4th centuries) are embossed with ''Aum'' along with other symbols.<ref>Henry Parker, ''Ancient Ceylon''  (1909), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=Nk8xpkY0bqEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA490 p. 490].</ref>\n[[N\u0101gar\u012b script|Nagari]] or [[Devanagari]] representations are found epigraphically on medieval sculpture, such as the [[dancing Shiva]] (ca. 10th to 12th century); [[Joseph Campbell]] (1949) even argued that the dance posture itself can be taken to represent ''AUM'' as a symbol of the entirety of \"consciousness, universe\" and \"the message that God is within a person and without\".<ref>Joseph Campbell (1949), ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', 108f.</ref>\n\nThe ''Om'' symbol, with [[epigraphic]]al variations, is also found in many [[Southeast Asia]]n countries.

In [[Unicode]], the symbol is encoded at {{unichar|0950|Devanagari OM}} and at {{unichar|1f549|OM Symbol}} (\"generic symbol independent of Devanagari font\").\n\nThe ''Om'' or ''Aum'' symbol is found on ancient coins, in regional scripts. In [[Sri Lanka]], [[Anuradhapura Kingdom|Anuradhapura era]] coins (dated from the 1st to 4th centuries) are embossed with ''Aum'' along with other symbols.<ref>Henry Parker, ''Ancient Ceylon''  (1909), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=Nk8xpkY0bqEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA490 p. 490].</ref>\n[[N\u0101gar\u012b script|Nagari]] or [[Devanagari]] representations are found epigraphically on medieval sculpture, such as the [[dancing Shiva]] (ca. 10th to 12th century); [[Joseph Campbell]] (1949) even argued that the dance posture itself can be taken to represent ''AUM'' as a symbol of the entirety of \"consciousness, universe\" and \"the message that God is within a person and without\".<ref>Joseph Campbell (1949), ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', 108f.</ref>\n\nThe ''Om'' symbol, with [[epigraphic]]al variations, is also found in many [[Southeast Asia]]n countries. For example, it is called ''Unalom'' or ''Aum'' in [[Thailand]] and has been a part of various flags and official emblems such as in the [[Royal Standard of Thailand#Fourth reign|Thong Chom Klao]] of [[Mongkut|King Rama IV]] (r. 1851\u20131868).<ref>Deborah Wong (2001), ''Sounding the Center: History and Aesthetics in Thai Buddhist Performance'', [[University of Chicago Press]], {{ISBN|978-0226905853}}, page 292</ref>\nThe [[Cambodia]]n official seal has similarly incorporated the ''Aum'' symbol.<ref>James Minahan (2009), ''The Complete Guide to National Symbols and Emblems'', {{ISBN|978-0313344961}}, pages 28-29</ref>\nIn [[traditional Chinese characters]], it is written as [[:wikt:\u5535|\u5535]] ([[pinyin]] \u2013 \u01cen), and as [[:wikt:\u55e1|\u55e1]] (pinyin \u2013 w\u0113ng) in [[simplified Chinese characters]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nThere have been proposals that the ''Om'' syllable may already have had written representations in [[Brahmi script]], dating to before the Common Era.

Several independent groups also conducted studies. The approximately 2 million people around TMI-2 during the accident are estimated to have received an average radiation dose of only about 1 millirem above the usual background dose. To put this into context, exposure from a chest X-ray is about 6 millirem and the area's natural radioactive background dose is about 100-125 millirem per year for the area. The accident's maximum dose to a person at the site boundary would have been less than 100 millirem above background. In the months following the accident, although questions were raised about possible adverse effects from radiation on human, animal, and plant life in the TMI area, none could be directly correlated to the accident. Thousands of environmental samples of air, water, milk, vegetation, soil, and foodstuffs were collected by various government agencies monitoring the area. Very low levels of radionuclides could be attributed to releases from the accident. Comprehensive investigations and assessments by several well respected organizations, such as Columbia University and the University of Pittsburgh, have concluded that in spite of serious damage to the reactor, the actual release had negligible effects on the physical health of individuals or the environment.}}</ref> Cleanup started in August 1979, and officially ended in December 1993, with a total cleanup cost of about $1&nbsp;billion.<ref name=\"nytimes1993\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/15/us/14-year-cleanup-at-three-mile-island-concludes.html |title=14-Year Cleanup at Three Mile Island Concludes |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 15, 1993 |accessdate=March 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== The Accident ==\n\n===Background===\n[[File:Tmi-2 schematic.svg|right|thumb|500px|Simplified schematic diagram of the TMI-2 plant<ref name=\"FactSheet\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/3mile-isle.html |title=Fact Sheet on the Three Mile Island Accident |website=[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}</ref>]]\n\nIn the night time hours preceding the incident, the TMI-2 reactor was running at 97% power, while the companion TMI-1 reactor was shut down for refueling.<ref>Walker, p. 71.</ref> The main chain of events leading to the partial core meltdown at 4:00:37&nbsp;am EST on March 28, 1979, began in TMI-2's secondary loop, one of the three main water/steam loops in a [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR).\n\nThe initial cause of the accident happened eleven hours earlier, during an attempt by operators to fix a blockage in one of the eight [[condensate polisher]]s, the sophisticated filters cleaning the secondary loop water. These filters are designed to stop minerals and impurities in the water from accumulating in the steam generators and increasing corrosion rates in the secondary side.\n\nBlockages are common with these resin filters and are usually fixed easily, but in this case the usual method of forcing the stuck resin out with compressed air did not succeed. The operators decided to blow the compressed air into the water and let the force of the water clear the resin. When they forced the resin out, a small amount of water forced its way past a stuck-open check valve and found its way into an instrument [[air line]]. This would eventually cause the [[feedwater pump]]s, condensate booster pumps, and condensate pumps to turn off around 4:00&nbsp;am, which would in turn cause a [[turbine trip]].<ref>INPO ICES Report #4810 (Three Mile Island Unit 2) Small Break LOCA Results in Core Damage.</ref>\n\n=== Reactor overheating and malfunction of relief valve ===\nAs the [[steam generator (nuclear power)|steam generators]] were no longer receiving feedwater, heat and pressure increased in the reactor coolant system, causing the reactor to perform an [[scram|emergency shutdown]] (SCRAM). Within eight seconds, [[control rod]]s were inserted into the core to halt the [[nuclear chain reaction]]. However the reactor continued to generate [[decay heat]], and because steam was no longer being used by the turbine, heat was no longer being removed from the reactor's primary water loop.<ref>Walker, pp. 72\u201373.</ref>\n\nOnce the secondary feedwater pumps stopped, three auxiliary pumps activated automatically. However, because the valves had been closed for routine maintenance, the system was unable to pump any water. The closure of these valves was a violation of a key [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) rule, according to which the reactor must be shut down if all auxiliary feed pumps are closed for maintenance. This was later singled out by NRC officials as a key failure.<ref name=postch1>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/tmi/stories/ch1.htm |title=A Pump Failure and Claxon Alert |date=1979 |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=September 4, 2016 |quote=Apparently the valves were closed for routine maintenance, in violation of one of the most stringent rules that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has. The rule states simply that auxiliary feed pumps can never all be down for maintenance while the reactor is running.}}</ref>\n\nThe loss of heat removal from the primary loop and the failure of the auxiliary system to activate caused the primary loop pressure to increase, triggering the [[pilot-operated relief valve]] at the top of the [[pressurizer]]{{spaced ndash}}a pressure active-regulator tank{{spaced ndash}}to open automatically. The relief valve should have closed when the excess pressure had been released, and electric power to the [[solenoid]] of the pilot was automatically cut, but the relief valve stuck open because of a mechanical fault. The open valve permitted coolant water to escape from the primary system, and was the principal mechanical cause of the primary coolant system depressurization and partial core disintegration that followed.<ref>Walker, pp. 73\u201374.</ref>\n\nCritical [[user interface engineering]] problems were revealed in the investigation of the reactor [[Process control|control]] system's [[user interface]]. Despite the valve being stuck open, a light on the control panel ostensibly indicated that the valve was ''closed''. In fact the light did not indicate the position of the valve, only the status of the solenoid being powered or not, thus giving false evidence of a closed valve.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.nixdell.com/classes/HCI-and-Design-Spring-2017/The-Design-of-Everyday-Things-Revised-and-Expanded-Edition.pdf|title=The Design of Everyday Things|title-link=The Design of Everyday Things|last=Norman|first=Donald|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|year=1988|isbn=978-0-465-06710-7|location=New York|pages=43\u201344|authorlink=Donald Norman}}</ref> As a result, the operators did not correctly diagnose the problem for several hours.<ref>Rogovin, pp. 14\u201315.</ref>  \n\nThe design of the pilot-operated relief valve indicator light was fundamentally flawed. The bulb was simply connected in parallel with the valve [[solenoid]], thus implying that the pilot-operated relief valve was shut when it went dark, without actually verifying the real position of the valve. When everything was operating correctly, the indication was true and the operators became habituated to rely on it. However, when things went wrong and the main relief valve stuck open, the unlighted lamp was actually misleading the operators by implying that the valve was shut. This caused the operators considerable confusion, because the pressure, temperature and coolant levels in the primary circuit, so far as they could observe them via their instruments, were not behaving as they would have if the pilot-operated relief valve were shut. This confusion contributed to the severity of the accident because the operators were unable to break out of a cycle of assumptions that conflicted with what their instruments were telling them. The problem was not correctly diagnosed until a fresh shift came in who did not have the mindset of the first shift of operators. By this time major damage had occurred.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe operators had not been trained to understand the ambiguous nature of the pilot-operated relief valve indicator and to look for alternative confirmation that the main relief valve was closed. A downstream temperature indicator, the sensor for which was located in the tail pipe between the pilot-operated relief valve and the pressurizer relief tank, could have hinted at a stuck valve had operators noticed its higher-than-normal reading. It was not, however, part of the \"safety grade\" suite of indicators designed to be used after an incident, and personnel had not been trained to use it. Its location on the back of the seven-foot-high instrument panel also meant that it was effectively out of sight.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Walker |first1=J. Samuel |authorlink1=J.

First, small bubbles of steam formed and immediately collapsed, known as [[nucleate boiling]]. As the system pressure decreased further, steam pockets began to form in the reactor coolant. This departure from nucleate boiling (DNB) into the regime of \"film boiling\" caused steam voids in coolant channels, blocking the flow of liquid coolant and greatly increasing the fuel cladding temperature. The overall water level inside the pressurizer was ''rising'' despite the loss of coolant through the open pilot-operated relief valve, as the volume of these steam voids increased much more quickly than coolant was lost. Because of the lack of a dedicated instrument to measure the level of water in the core, operators judged the level of water in the core solely by the level in the pressurizer. Since it was high, they assumed that the core was properly covered with coolant, unaware that because of steam forming in the reactor vessel, the indicator provided misleading readings.<ref>Kemeny, p. 94.</ref> Indications of high water levels contributed to the confusion, as operators were concerned about the primary loop \"going solid\", (i.e., no steam pocket buffer existing in the pressurizer) which in training they had been instructed to never allow. This confusion was a key contributor to the initial failure to recognize the accident as a [[loss-of-coolant accident]], and led operators to turn off the emergency core cooling pumps, which had automatically started after the pilot-operated relief valve stuck and core coolant loss began, due to fears the system was being overfilled.<ref>Rogovin, p. 16, Walker, pp. 76\u201377.</ref><ref name=upi>{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/03/28/Three-Mile-Island-clings-to-survival-40-years-after-1979-meltdown/1121553642219/?ls=1 |title=TMI clings to survival 40 years after 1979 meltdown |date=March 28, 2019 |newspaper=United Press International}}</ref>\n\nWith the pilot-operated relief valve still open, the pressurizer relief tank that collected the discharge from the pilot-operated relief valve overfilled, causing the containment building [[sump]] to fill and sound an alarm at 4:11&nbsp;am. This alarm, along with higher than normal temperatures on the pilot-operated relief valve discharge line and unusually high containment building temperatures and pressures, were clear indications that there was an ongoing loss-of-coolant accident, but these indications were initially ignored by operators.<ref>Kemeny, p. 96; Rogovin, pp. 17\u201318.</ref> At 4:15&nbsp;am, the relief diaphragm of the pressurizer relief tank ruptured, and radioactive coolant began to leak out into the general [[containment building]]. This radioactive coolant was pumped from the [[containment building]] sump to an auxiliary building, outside the main containment, until the [[sump pump]]s were stopped at 4:39&nbsp;am.<ref>Kemeny, p. 96.</ref>\n\n=== Partial meltdown and further release of radioactive substances ===\nAt about 5:20, after almost 80&nbsp;minutes of slow temperature rise, the primary loop's four main reactor coolant pumps began to [[cavitation|cavitate]] as a steam bubble/water mixture, rather than water, passed through them. The pumps were shut down, and it was believed that natural circulation would continue the water movement. Steam in the system prevented flow through the core, and as the water stopped circulating it was converted to steam in increasing amounts. Soon after 6:00, the top of the reactor core was exposed and the intense heat caused a reaction to occur between the steam forming in the reactor core and the [[zircaloy]] [[nuclear fuel rod]] [[Clad (metallurgy)|cladding]], yielding [[zirconium dioxide]], [[hydrogen]], and additional heat. This reaction melted the nuclear fuel rod cladding and damaged the fuel pellets, which released radioactive isotopes to the reactor coolant, and produced hydrogen gas that is believed to have caused a small explosion in the containment building later that afternoon.<ref>Kemeny, p. 99.</ref>\n\n[[File:Graphic TMI-2 Core End-State Configuration.png|thumb|left|300px|NRC graphic of TMI-2 core end-state configuration.\n1. 2B inlet, 2. 1A inlet, 3. cavity, 4. loose core debris, 5. crust, 6. previously molten material, 7. lower plenum debris, 8. possible region depleted in uranium, 9.\nablated incore instrument guide, 10. hole in baffle plate,\n11. coating of previously-molten material on bypass region interior surfaces, 12.\nupper grid damage]]\n\nAt 6&nbsp;am, there was a shift change in the control room.

Thornburgh]] and [[Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania|lieutenant governor]] [[William Scranton III]], to whom Thornburgh assigned responsibility for collecting and reporting on information about the accident.<ref>Walker, pp. 80\u201381.</ref> The uncertainty of operators at the plant was reflected in fragmentary, ambiguous, or contradictory statements made by Met Ed to government agencies and to the press, particularly about the possibility and severity of off-site radioactivity releases. Scranton held a press conference in which he was reassuring, yet confusing, about this possibility, stating that though there had been a \"small release of radiation...no increase in normal radiation levels\" had been detected. These were contradicted by another official, and by statements from Met Ed, who both claimed that no radioactivity had been released.<ref>Walker, pp. 80\u201384.</ref> In fact, readings from instruments at the plant and off-site detectors had detected radioactivity releases, albeit at levels that were unlikely to threaten public health as long as they were temporary, and providing that containment of the then highly contaminated reactor was maintained.<ref>Walker, pp. 84\u201386.</ref>\n\nAngry that Met Ed had not informed them before conducting a steam venting from the plant, and convinced that the company was downplaying the severity of the accident, state officials turned to the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|NRC]].<ref>Walker, p. 87.</ref> After receiving word of the accident from Met Ed, the NRC had activated its emergency response headquarters in [[Bethesda, Maryland]] and sent staff members to Three Mile Island. NRC chairman [[Joseph Hendrie]] and commissioner Victor Gilinsky<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/organization/commission/former-commissioners/gilinsky.html |title=Victor Gilinsky |website=Nuclear Regulatory Commission |accessdate=March 6, 2018}}</ref> initially viewed the accident, in the words of NRC historian Samuel Walker, as a \"cause for concern but not alarm\".<ref>Walker, p. 89.</ref> Gilinsky briefed reporters and members of Congress on the situation and informed White House staff, and at 10:00&nbsp;a.m. met with two other commissioners. However, the NRC faced the same problems in obtaining accurate information as the state, and was further hampered by being organizationally ill-prepared to deal with emergencies, as it lacked a clear [[command structure]] and did not have the authority either to tell the utility what to do, or to order an evacuation of the local area.<ref>Walker, pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\nIn a 2009 article, Gilinsky wrote that it took five weeks to learn that \"the reactor operators had measured fuel temperatures near the melting point\".<ref name=Gilinsky2009>{{cite journal |last=Gilinsky |first=Victor |title=Behind the scenes of Three Mile Island |journal=[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] |date=March 23, 2009 |url=http://thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/behind-the-scenes-of-three-mile-island |accessdate=March 31, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815015736/http://thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/behind-the-scenes-of-three-mile-island |archivedate=August 15, 2009}}</ref> He further wrote: \"We didn't learn for years{{spaced ndash}}until the reactor vessel was physically opened{{spaced ndash}}that by the time the plant operator called the NRC at about 8:00&nbsp;a.m., roughly half of the uranium fuel had already melted.\"<ref name=\"Gilinsky2009\"/>\n\nIt was still not clear to the control room staff that the primary loop water levels were low and that over half of the core was exposed. A group of workers took manual readings from the [[thermocouple]]s and obtained a sample of primary loop water. Seven hours into the emergency, new water was pumped into the primary loop and the backup relief valve was opened to reduce pressure so that the loop could be filled with water. After 16&nbsp;hours the primary loop pumps were turned on once again, and the core temperature began to fall. A large part of the core had [[Nuclear meltdown|melted]], and the system was still dangerously radioactive.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nOn the third day following the accident, a hydrogen bubble was discovered in the dome of the pressure vessel, and became the focus of concern. A hydrogen explosion might not only breach the pressure vessel, but, depending on its magnitude, might compromise the integrity of the containment vessel leading to large-scale release of radioactive material. However, it was determined that there was no oxygen present in the pressure vessel, a prerequisite for hydrogen to burn or explode. Immediate steps were taken to reduce the hydrogen bubble, and by the following day it was significantly smaller. Over the next week, steam and hydrogen were removed from the reactor using a [[Catalyst#Heterogeneous catalysts|catalytic]] recombiner and, controversially, by venting straight to the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Identification of released radioactive material===\nThe release occurred when the cladding was damaged while the pilot-operated relief valve was still stuck open. Fission products were released into the reactor coolant. Since the pilot-operated relief valve was stuck open and the loss of coolant accident was still in progress, primary coolant with fission products and/or fuel was released, and ultimately ended up in the auxiliary building. The auxiliary building was outside the containment boundary.\n\nThis was evidenced by the radiation alarms that eventually sounded. However, since very little of the fission products released were solids at room temperature, very little [[radiological contamination]] was reported in the environment. No significant level of radiation was attributed to the TMI-2 accident outside of the TMI-2 facility. According to the Rogovin report, the vast majority of the radioisotopes released were the noble gases xenon and krypton. The report stated, \"During the course of the accident, approximately {{convert|2.5|MCi|abbr=on}} of radioactive noble gases and {{convert|15|Ci|abbr=on}} of radioiodines were released.\" This resulted in an average dose of {{convert|1.4|mrem|uSv|abbr=on}} to the two million people near the plant. The report compared this with the additional {{convert|80|mrem|uSv|abbr=on}} per year received from living in a high altitude city such as Denver.<ref>Rogovin, pp. 25, 153.</ref> As further comparison, a patient receives {{convert|3.2|mrem|uSv|abbr=on}} from a chest X-ray\u2014more than twice the average dose of those received near the plant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.physics.isu.edu/radinf/risk.htm |title=Radiation and Risk |website=ISU Health Physics Radinf |accessdate=March 6, 2018 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406055010/http://www.physics.isu.edu/radinf/risk.htm |archive-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref> Measures of [[beta radiation]] were excluded from the report.\n\nWithin hours of the accident, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) began daily sampling of the environment at the three stations closest to the plant. Continuous monitoring at 11&nbsp;stations was not established until April 1, and was expanded to 31 stations on April 3. An inter-agency analysis concluded that the accident did not raise radioactivity far enough above background levels to cause even one additional cancer death among the people in the area, but measures of beta radiation were not included.

TMI was an example of this type of accident because it was \"unexpected, incomprehensible, uncontrollable and unavoidable\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Perrow |first=C. |chapter=The President's Commission and the Normal Accident |editor-last1=Sils |editor-first1=D. |editor-last2=Wolf |editor-first2=C. |editor-last3=Shelanski |editor-first3=V. |title=Accident at Three Mile Island: The Human Dimensions |date=1982 |publisher=[[Westview Press]] |location=Boulder, CO |pages=173\u2013184}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Perrow concluded that the failure at Three Mile Island was a consequence of the system's immense complexity. Such modern high-risk systems, he realized, were prone to failures however well they were managed. It was inevitable that they would eventually suffer what he termed a 'normal accident'. Therefore, he suggested, we might do better to contemplate a radical redesign, or if that was not possible, to abandon such technology entirely.<ref name=nature477>{{cite journal |title=In retrospect: Normal accidents |first=Nick |last=Pidgeon |date=September 22, 2011 |volume=477 |issue=7365 |pages=404\u2013405 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|bibcode=2011Natur.477..404P |doi=10.1038/477404a }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n\"Normal\" accidents, or [[system accident]]s, are so-called by Perrow because such accidents are inevitable in extremely complex systems.

Technological disasters could no longer be ascribed to isolated equipment malfunction, operator error or acts of God.<ref name=nature477/></blockquote>\n\n===Comparison to U.S. Navy operations===\nFollowing the [[Three Mile Island]] (TMI) power plant's partial core melt on March 28, 1979, President [[Jimmy Carter]] commissioned a study, ''Report of the President's Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island'' (1979).<ref name=\"PresidentsCommission\"/> Subsequently, [[Admiral]] [[Hyman G. Rickover]] was asked to testify before Congress in the general context of answering the question as to why naval nuclear propulsion (as used in [[Nuclear submarine|submarines]]) had succeeded in achieving a record of zero reactor-accidents (as defined by the uncontrolled release of fission products to the environment resulting from damage to a reactor core) as opposed to the dramatic one that had just taken place at Three Mile Island. In his testimony, he said:\n\n<blockquote>Over the years, many people have asked me how I run the [[Naval Reactors]] Program, so that they might find some benefit for their own work. I am always chagrined at the tendency of people to expect that I have a simple, easy gimmick that makes my program function. Any successful program functions as an integrated whole of many factors.

The operating crew notices a high-pressure measurement on a gauge and begins to reduce coolant flow to lower the pressure. This does not appear to work, and they continue reducing the flow until an emergency indicator lamp warns of extremely low pressure. Confused by the conflicting indications, an operator taps the gauge, at which point the needle becomes unstuck and swings over to indicate extremely low pressure. (This is based on a 1970 incident at [[Dresden Generating Station#Activity|Dresden Generating Station.]]) The reactor is [[SCRAM]]ed. In the aftermath, the plant supervisor, Jack Godell ([[Jack Lemmon]]) discovers potentially catastrophic safety violations at the plant and with Wells' assistance attempts to raise public awareness of these violations.

Several independent groups also conducted studies. The approximately 2 million people around TMI-2 during the accident are estimated to have received an average radiation dose of only about 1 millirem above the usual background dose. To put this into context, exposure from a chest X-ray is about 6 millirem and the area's natural radioactive background dose is about 100-125 millirem per year for the area. The accident's maximum dose to a person at the site boundary would have been less than 100 millirem above background. In the months following the accident, although questions were raised about possible adverse effects from radiation on human, animal, and plant life in the TMI area, none could be directly correlated to the accident. Thousands of environmental samples of air, water, milk, vegetation, soil, and foodstuffs were collected by various government agencies monitoring the area. Very low levels of radionuclides could be attributed to releases from the accident. Comprehensive investigations and assessments by several well respected organizations, such as Columbia University and the University of Pittsburgh, have concluded that in spite of serious damage to the reactor, the actual release had negligible effects on the physical health of individuals or the environment.}}</ref> Cleanup started in August 1979, and officially ended in December 1993, with a total cleanup cost of about $1&nbsp;billion.<ref name=\"nytimes1993\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/15/us/14-year-cleanup-at-three-mile-island-concludes.html |title=14-Year Cleanup at Three Mile Island Concludes |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 15, 1993 |accessdate=March 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== The Accident ==\n\n===Background===\n[[File:Tmi-2 schematic.svg|right|thumb|500px|Simplified schematic diagram of the TMI-2 plant<ref name=\"FactSheet\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/3mile-isle.html |title=Fact Sheet on the Three Mile Island Accident |website=[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}</ref>]]\n\nIn the night time hours preceding the incident, the TMI-2 reactor was running at 97% power, while the companion TMI-1 reactor was shut down for refueling.<ref>Walker, p. 71.</ref> The main chain of events leading to the partial core meltdown at 4:37&nbsp;am EST on March 28, 1979, began in TMI-2's secondary loop, one of the three main water/steam loops in a [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR).\n\nThe initial cause of the accident happened eleven hours earlier, during an attempt by operators to fix a blockage in one of the eight [[condensate polisher]]s, the sophisticated filters cleaning the secondary loop water. These filters are designed to stop minerals and impurities in the water from accumulating in the steam generators and increasing corrosion rates in the secondary side.\n\nBlockages are common with these resin filters and are usually fixed easily, but in this case the usual method of forcing the stuck resin out with compressed air did not succeed. The operators decided to blow the compressed air into the water and let the force of the water clear the resin. When they forced the resin out, a small amount of water forced its way past a stuck-open check valve and found its way into an instrument [[air line]]. This would eventually cause the [[feedwater pump]]s, condensate booster pumps, and condensate pumps to turn off around 4:00&nbsp;am, which would in turn cause a [[turbine trip]].<ref>INPO ICES Report #4810 (Three Mile Island Unit 2) Small Break LOCA Results in Core Damage.</ref>\n\n=== Reactor overheating and malfunction of relief valve ===\nAs the [[steam generator (nuclear power)|steam generators]] were no longer receiving feedwater, heat and pressure increased in the reactor coolant system, causing the reactor to perform an [[scram|emergency shutdown]] (SCRAM). Within eight seconds, [[control rod]]s were inserted into the core to halt the [[nuclear chain reaction]]. However the reactor continued to generate [[decay heat]], and because steam was no longer being used by the turbine, heat was no longer being removed from the reactor's primary water loop.<ref>Walker, pp. 72\u201373.</ref>\n\nOnce the secondary feedwater pumps stopped, three auxiliary pumps activated automatically. However, because the valves had been closed for routine maintenance, the system was unable to pump any water. The closure of these valves was a violation of a key [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) rule, according to which the reactor must be shut down if all auxiliary feed pumps are closed for maintenance. This was later singled out by NRC officials as a key failure.<ref name=postch1>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/tmi/stories/ch1.htm |title=A Pump Failure and Claxon Alert |date=1979 |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=September 4, 2016 |quote=Apparently the valves were closed for routine maintenance, in violation of one of the most stringent rules that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has. The rule states simply that auxiliary feed pumps can never all be down for maintenance while the reactor is running.}}</ref>\n\nThe loss of heat removal from the primary loop and the failure of the auxiliary system to activate caused the primary loop pressure to increase, triggering the [[pilot-operated relief valve]] at the top of the [[pressurizer]]{{spaced ndash}}a pressure active-regulator tank{{spaced ndash}}to open automatically. The relief valve should have closed when the excess pressure had been released, and electric power to the [[solenoid]] of the pilot was automatically cut, but the relief valve stuck open because of a mechanical fault. The open valve permitted coolant water to escape from the primary system, and was the principal mechanical cause of the primary coolant system depressurization and partial core disintegration that followed.<ref>Walker, pp. 73\u201374.</ref>\n\nCritical [[user interface engineering]] problems were revealed in the investigation of the reactor [[Process control|control]] system's [[user interface]]. Despite the valve being stuck open, a light on the control panel ostensibly indicated that the valve was ''closed''. In fact the light did not indicate the position of the valve, only the status of the solenoid being powered or not, thus giving false evidence of a closed valve.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.nixdell.com/classes/HCI-and-Design-Spring-2017/The-Design-of-Everyday-Things-Revised-and-Expanded-Edition.pdf|title=The Design of Everyday Things|title-link=The Design of Everyday Things|last=Norman|first=Donald|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|year=1988|isbn=978-0-465-06710-7|location=New York|pages=43\u201344|authorlink=Donald Norman}}</ref> As a result, the operators did not correctly diagnose the problem for several hours.<ref>Rogovin, pp. 14\u201315.</ref>  \n\nThe design of the pilot-operated relief valve indicator light was fundamentally flawed. The bulb was simply connected in parallel with the valve [[solenoid]], thus implying that the pilot-operated relief valve was shut when it went dark, without actually verifying the real position of the valve. When everything was operating correctly, the indication was true and the operators became habituated to rely on it. However, when things went wrong and the main relief valve stuck open, the unlighted lamp was actually misleading the operators by implying that the valve was shut. This caused the operators considerable confusion, because the pressure, temperature and coolant levels in the primary circuit, so far as they could observe them via their instruments, were not behaving as they would have if the pilot-operated relief valve were shut. This confusion contributed to the severity of the accident because the operators were unable to break out of a cycle of assumptions that conflicted with what their instruments were telling them. The problem was not correctly diagnosed until a fresh shift came in who did not have the mindset of the first shift of operators. By this time major damage had occurred.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe operators had not been trained to understand the ambiguous nature of the pilot-operated relief valve indicator and to look for alternative confirmation that the main relief valve was closed. A downstream temperature indicator, the sensor for which was located in the tail pipe between the pilot-operated relief valve and the pressurizer relief tank, could have hinted at a stuck valve had operators noticed its higher-than-normal reading. It was not, however, part of the \"safety grade\" suite of indicators designed to be used after an incident, and personnel had not been trained to use it. Its location on the back of the seven-foot-high instrument panel also meant that it was effectively out of sight.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Walker |first1=J. Samuel |authorlink1=J.

First, small bubbles of steam formed and immediately collapsed, known as [[nucleate boiling]]. As the system pressure decreased further, steam pockets began to form in the reactor coolant. This departure from nucleate boiling (DNB) into the regime of \"film boiling\" caused steam voids in coolant channels, blocking the flow of liquid coolant and greatly increasing the fuel cladding temperature. The overall water level inside the pressurizer was ''rising'' despite the loss of coolant through the open pilot-operated relief valve, as the volume of these steam voids increased much more quickly than coolant was lost. Because of the lack of a dedicated instrument to measure the level of water in the core, operators judged the level of water in the core solely by the level in the pressurizer. Since it was high, they assumed that the core was properly covered with coolant, unaware that because of steam forming in the reactor vessel, the indicator provided misleading readings.<ref>Kemeny, p. 94.</ref> Indications of high water levels contributed to the confusion, as operators were concerned about the primary loop \"going solid\", (i.e., no steam pocket buffer existing in the pressurizer) which in training they had been instructed to never allow. This confusion was a key contributor to the initial failure to recognize the accident as a [[loss-of-coolant accident]], and led operators to turn off the emergency core cooling pumps, which had automatically started after the pilot-operated relief valve stuck and core coolant loss began, due to fears the system was being overfilled.<ref>Rogovin, p. 16, Walker, pp. 76\u201377.</ref><ref name=upi>{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/03/28/Three-Mile-Island-clings-to-survival-40-years-after-1979-meltdown/1121553642219/?ls=1 |title=TMI clings to survival 40 years after 1979 meltdown |date=March 28, 2019 |newspaper=United Press International}}</ref>\n\nWith the pilot-operated relief valve still open, the pressurizer relief tank that collected the discharge from the pilot-operated relief valve overfilled, causing the containment building [[sump]] to fill and sound an alarm at 4:11&nbsp;am. This alarm, along with higher than normal temperatures on the pilot-operated relief valve discharge line and unusually high containment building temperatures and pressures, were clear indications that there was an ongoing loss-of-coolant accident, but these indications were initially ignored by operators.<ref>Kemeny, p. 96; Rogovin, pp. 17\u201318.</ref> At 4:15&nbsp;am, the relief diaphragm of the pressurizer relief tank ruptured, and radioactive coolant began to leak out into the general [[containment building]]. This radioactive coolant was pumped from the [[containment building]] sump to an auxiliary building, outside the main containment, until the [[sump pump]]s were stopped at 4:39&nbsp;am.<ref>Kemeny, p. 96.</ref>\n\n=== Partial meltdown and further release of radioactive substances ===\nAt about 5:20, after almost 80&nbsp;minutes of slow temperature rise, the primary loop's four main reactor coolant pumps began to [[cavitation|cavitate]] as a steam bubble/water mixture, rather than water, passed through them. The pumps were shut down, and it was believed that natural circulation would continue the water movement. Steam in the system prevented flow through the core, and as the water stopped circulating it was converted to steam in increasing amounts. Soon after 6:00, the top of the reactor core was exposed and the intense heat caused a reaction to occur between the steam forming in the reactor core and the [[zircaloy]] [[nuclear fuel rod]] [[Clad (metallurgy)|cladding]], yielding [[zirconium dioxide]], [[hydrogen]], and additional heat. This reaction melted the nuclear fuel rod cladding and damaged the fuel pellets, which released radioactive isotopes to the reactor coolant, and produced hydrogen gas that is believed to have caused a small explosion in the containment building later that afternoon.<ref>Kemeny, p. 99.</ref>\n\n[[File:Graphic TMI-2 Core End-State Configuration.png|thumb|left|300px|NRC graphic of TMI-2 core end-state configuration.\n1. 2B inlet, 2. 1A inlet, 3. cavity, 4. loose core debris, 5. crust, 6. previously molten material, 7. lower plenum debris, 8. possible region depleted in uranium, 9.\nablated incore instrument guide, 10. hole in baffle plate,\n11. coating of previously-molten material on bypass region interior surfaces, 12.\nupper grid damage]]\n\nAt 6&nbsp;am, there was a shift change in the control room. A new arrival noticed that the temperature in the pilot-operated relief valve tail pipe and the holding tanks was excessive and used a backup valve{{spaced ndash}}called a \"block valve\"{{spaced ndash}}to shut off the coolant venting via the pilot-operated relief valve, but around {{convert|32000|USgal|l|abbr=on}} of coolant had already leaked from the primary loop.<ref>Rogovin, p. 19; Walker, p. 78.</ref> It was not until 6:45 am, 165 minutes after the start of the problem, that radiation alarms activated when the contaminated water reached detectors; by that time, the radiation levels in the primary coolant water were around 300&nbsp;times expected levels, and the general containment building was seriously contaminated.\n\n==Emergency declaration and immediate aftermath==\nAt 6:57&nbsp;am, a plant supervisor declared a [[Nuclear safety in the United States#Emergency Classifications|site area emergency]], and less than 30&nbsp;minutes later station manager Gary Miller announced a general emergency, defined as having the \"potential for serious radiological consequences\" to the general public.<ref>Walker, p. 79.</ref> [[FirstEnergy|Metropolitan Edison]] (Met Ed) notified the [[Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency]] (PEMA), which in turn contacted state and local agencies, [[Governor of Pennsylvania|Governor]] [[Richard L. Thornburgh]] and [[Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania|lieutenant governor]] [[William Scranton III]], to whom Thornburgh assigned responsibility for collecting and reporting on information about the accident.<ref>Walker, pp. 80\u201381.</ref> The uncertainty of operators at the plant was reflected in fragmentary, ambiguous, or contradictory statements made by Met Ed to government agencies and to the press, particularly about the possibility and severity of off-site radioactivity releases. Scranton held a press conference in which he was reassuring, yet confusing, about this possibility, stating that though there had been a \"small release of radiation...no increase in normal radiation levels\" had been detected. These were contradicted by another official, and by statements from Met Ed, who both claimed that no radioactivity had been released.<ref>Walker, pp. 80\u201384.</ref> In fact, readings from instruments at the plant and off-site detectors had detected radioactivity releases, albeit at levels that were unlikely to threaten public health as long as they were temporary, and providing that containment of the then highly contaminated reactor was maintained.<ref>Walker, pp. 84\u201386.</ref>\n\nAngry that Met Ed had not informed them before conducting a steam venting from the plant, and convinced that the company was downplaying the severity of the accident, state officials turned to the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|NRC]].<ref>Walker, p. 87.</ref> After receiving word of the accident from Met Ed, the NRC had activated its emergency response headquarters in [[Bethesda, Maryland]] and sent staff members to Three Mile Island. NRC chairman [[Joseph Hendrie]] and commissioner Victor Gilinsky<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/organization/commission/former-commissioners/gilinsky.html |title=Victor Gilinsky |website=Nuclear Regulatory Commission |accessdate=March 6, 2018}}</ref> initially viewed the accident, in the words of NRC historian Samuel Walker, as a \"cause for concern but not alarm\".<ref>Walker, p. 89.</ref> Gilinsky briefed reporters and members of Congress on the situation and informed White House staff, and at 10:00&nbsp;a.m. met with two other commissioners. However, the NRC faced the same problems in obtaining accurate information as the state, and was further hampered by being organizationally ill-prepared to deal with emergencies, as it lacked a clear [[command structure]] and did not have the authority either to tell the utility what to do, or to order an evacuation of the local area.<ref>Walker, pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\nIn a 2009 article, Gilinsky wrote that it took five weeks to learn that \"the reactor operators had measured fuel temperatures near the melting point\".<ref name=Gilinsky2009>{{cite journal |last=Gilinsky |first=Victor |title=Behind the scenes of Three Mile Island |journal=[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] |date=March 23, 2009 |url=http://thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/behind-the-scenes-of-three-mile-island |accessdate=March 31, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815015736/http://thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/behind-the-scenes-of-three-mile-island |archivedate=August 15, 2009}}</ref> He further wrote: \"We didn't learn for years{{spaced ndash}}until the reactor vessel was physically opened{{spaced ndash}}that by the time the plant operator called the NRC at about 8:00&nbsp;a.m., roughly half of the uranium fuel had already melted.\"<ref name=\"Gilinsky2009\"/>\n\nIt was still not clear to the control room staff that the primary loop water levels were low and that over half of the core was exposed. A group of workers took manual readings from the [[thermocouple]]s and obtained a sample of primary loop water. Seven hours into the emergency, new water was pumped into the primary loop and the backup relief valve was opened to reduce pressure so that the loop could be filled with water. After 16&nbsp;hours the primary loop pumps were turned on once again, and the core temperature began to fall. A large part of the core had [[Nuclear meltdown|melted]], and the system was still dangerously radioactive.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nOn the third day following the accident, a hydrogen bubble was discovered in the dome of the pressure vessel, and became the focus of concern. A hydrogen explosion might not only breach the pressure vessel, but, depending on its magnitude, might compromise the integrity of the containment vessel leading to large-scale release of radioactive material. However, it was determined that there was no oxygen present in the pressure vessel, a prerequisite for hydrogen to burn or explode. Immediate steps were taken to reduce the hydrogen bubble, and by the following day it was significantly smaller. Over the next week, steam and hydrogen were removed from the reactor using a [[Catalyst#Heterogeneous catalysts|catalytic]] recombiner and, controversially, by venting straight to the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Identification of released radioactive material===\nThe release occurred when the cladding was damaged while the pilot-operated relief valve was still stuck open. Fission products were released into the reactor coolant. Since the pilot-operated relief valve was stuck open and the loss of coolant accident was still in progress, primary coolant with fission products and/or fuel was released, and ultimately ended up in the auxiliary building. The auxiliary building was outside the containment boundary.\n\nThis was evidenced by the radiation alarms that eventually sounded. However, since very little of the fission products released were solids at room temperature, very little [[radiological contamination]] was reported in the environment. No significant level of radiation was attributed to the TMI-2 accident outside of the TMI-2 facility. According to the Rogovin report, the vast majority of the radioisotopes released were the noble gases xenon and krypton. The report stated, \"During the course of the accident, approximately {{convert|2.5|MCi|abbr=on}} of radioactive noble gases and {{convert|15|Ci|abbr=on}} of radioiodines were released.\" This resulted in an average dose of {{convert|1.4|mrem|uSv|abbr=on}} to the two million people near the plant. The report compared this with the additional {{convert|80|mrem|uSv|abbr=on}} per year received from living in a high altitude city such as Denver.<ref>Rogovin, pp. 25, 153.</ref> As further comparison, a patient receives {{convert|3.2|mrem|uSv|abbr=on}} from a chest X-ray\u2014more than twice the average dose of those received near the plant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.physics.isu.edu/radinf/risk.htm |title=Radiation and Risk |website=ISU Health Physics Radinf |accessdate=March 6, 2018 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406055010/http://www.physics.isu.edu/radinf/risk.htm |archive-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref> Measures of [[beta radiation]] were excluded from the report.\n\nWithin hours of the accident, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) began daily sampling of the environment at the three stations closest to the plant. Continuous monitoring at 11&nbsp;stations was not established until April 1, and was expanded to 31 stations on April 3. An inter-agency analysis concluded that the accident did not raise radioactivity far enough above background levels to cause even one additional cancer death among the people in the area, but measures of beta radiation were not included.

It made the case for examining technological failures as the product of highly interacting systems, and highlighted organizational and management factors as the main causes of failures. Technological disasters could no longer be ascribed to isolated equipment malfunction, operator error or acts of God.<ref name=nature477/></blockquote>\n\n===Comparison to U.S. Navy operations===\nFollowing the [[Three Mile Island]] (TMI) power plant's partial core melt on March 28, 1979, President [[Jimmy Carter]] commissioned a study, ''Report of the President's Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island'' (1979).<ref name=\"PresidentsCommission\"/> Subsequently, [[Admiral]] [[Hyman G. Rickover]] was asked to testify before Congress in the general context of answering the question as to why naval nuclear propulsion (as used in [[Nuclear submarine|submarines]]) had succeeded in achieving a record of zero reactor-accidents (as defined by the uncontrolled release of fission products to the environment resulting from damage to a reactor core) as opposed to the dramatic one that had just taken place at Three Mile Island. In his testimony, he said:\n\n<blockquote>Over the years, many people have asked me how I run the [[Naval Reactors]] Program, so that they might find some benefit for their own work. I am always chagrined at the tendency of people to expect that I have a simple, easy gimmick that makes my program function. Any successful program functions as an integrated whole of many factors. Trying to select one aspect as the key one will not work. Each element depends on all the others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/testimony/safety/bowman031029.txt |title=Statement of Admiral F.

The operating crew notices a high-pressure measurement on a gauge and begins to reduce coolant flow to lower the pressure. This does not appear to work, and they continue reducing the flow until an emergency indicator lamp warns of extremely low pressure. Confused by the conflicting indications, an operator taps the gauge, at which point the needle becomes unstuck and swings over to indicate extremely low pressure. (This is based on a 1970 incident at [[Dresden Generating Station#Activity|Dresden Generating Station.]]) The reactor is [[SCRAM]]ed. In the aftermath, the plant supervisor, Jack Godell ([[Jack Lemmon]]) discovers potentially catastrophic safety violations at the plant and with Wells' assistance attempts to raise public awareness of these violations.

Handball was included in the [[Olympic Games]] for the first time under the auspices of IHF in [[1972 Summer Olympics|Munich 1972]] (men's tournament) and [[1976 Summer Olympics|Montreal 1976]] (women's tournament).\n\n==Structure==\n===Laws and governance===\nIHF is headquartered in [[Basel]], and is a federation established under the [[Law of Switzerland]].\nIHF's supreme body is the [[IHF Congress]], an assembly made up of representatives from each affiliated member association. Each national handball association has one vote, regardless of its size or handballing strength. The Congress assembles in ordinary session once in two years (odd years) after the [[IHF World Men's Handball Championship]]. The congress makes decisions relating to IHF's governing statutes and their method of implementation and application. Only the Congress can pass changes to IHF's statutes. The congress approves the annual report, and decides on the acceptance of new national associations and holds elections. Congress elects the President of IHF, its General Secretary, and the other members of the [[IHF Council]].\nIHF's Council, chaired by the President, is the main decision-making body of the organisation in the intervals of Congress. The Council is composed of 18 people: the President, 5 Vice Presidents, and 12 members. The Council is the body that decides which country will host the World Championship.\nThe President and General Secretary are the main officeholders of IHF, and are in charge of its daily administration, carried out by the General Secretariat. Dr. [[Hassan Moustafa]] is the current president, appointed in the year 2000 at the 28th Ordinary [[IHF Congress]].\n\n===Six confederations and 209 national associations===\nThe IHF is composed of six continental federations which organize continental championships held every other second year: [[African Handball Confederation]], [[Asian Handball Federation]], [[European Handball Federation]], [[North America and the Caribbean Handball Confederation]], [[Oceania Continent Handball Federation]], and [[South and Central America Handball Confederation]]. In addition to continental competitions between national teams, the federations arrange international tournaments between club teams.<ref name=\"ihf-rules-I\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ihf.info/upload/Manual/IHF_STATUTS_CHAP_01_GB.pdf|title=Bylaws|date=September 2007|publisher=International Handball Federation|page=7|accessdate=2 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nUntil 2017, there were five continental confederations. On 14 January 2018, the IHF Council divided the Pan-American Confederation into the North America and the Caribbean Handball Confederation and the South and Central America Handball Confederation. The authority to divide a continental confederation was assigned to the [[IHF Congress]], but the 36th [[IHF Congress]] in 2017 authorized the IHF Council to divide the [[Pan-American Team Handball Federation]].<ref>{{cite news |title=IHF statement related to Pan-American continent |url=http://www.ihf.info/en-us/theihf/continentalfederations/europeanhandballfederation(ehf)/listoffederations/croatianhandballfederation/news/newsdetails.aspx?ID=5506 |publisher=IHF |date= 19 January 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==IHF Presidents==\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#2a4b8d\" align=\"center\" span style=\"color:white\"\n!S.

IHF is responsible for the organisation of handball's major international tournaments, notably the [[IHF World Men's Handball Championship]], which commenced in 1938, and the [[IHF World Women's Handball Championship]], which commenced in 1957.\n\nIHF was founded in 1946 to oversee international competitions. Headquartered in [[Basel]], its membership now comprises 209 national federations. Each member country must each also be a member of one of the six regional confederations: [[African Handball Confederation|Africa]], [[Asian Handball Federation|Asia]], [[European Handball Federation|Europe]], [[North America and the Caribbean Handball Confederation|North America and Caribbean]], [[Oceania Continent Handball Federation|Oceania]], and [[South and Central America Handball Confederation|South and Central America]]. Dr. [[Hassan Moustafa]] from [[Egypt]] has been President of the IHF since 2000.\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2019}}\nThe IHF was founded on 11 July 1946, in [[Copenhagen]] ([[Denmark]]) by representatives of eight national federations. The founding members were [[Danish Handball Federation|Denmark]], [[Finnish Handball Association|Finland]], [[French Handball Federation|France]], [[Norwegian Handball Federation|Norway]], [[Netherlands Handball Association|Netherlands]], [[Poland Handball Federation|Poland]], [[Swedish Handball Federation|Sweden]], and [[Swiss Handball Association|Switzerland]]. The first president of IHF was G\u00f6sta Bj\u00f6rk from [[Sweden]]. Bj\u00f6rk was replaced in 1950 by [[Hans Baumann (handball)|Hans Baumann]] from [[Switzerland]].\nIn 1954, the first [[IHF World Men's Handball Championship|IHF Men's World Championship]], was conducted under the aegis of the IHF, in Sweden with the participation of six national teams. In 1957, the first [[IHF World Women's Handball Championship]] was held in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia |SFR Yugoslavia]] with the participation of nine national teams. Handball was included in the [[Olympic Games]] for the first time under the auspices of IHF in [[1972 Summer Olympics|Munich 1972]] (men's tournament) and [[1976 Summer Olympics|Montreal 1976]] (women's tournament).\n\n==Structure==\n===Laws and governance===\nIHF is headquartered in [[Basel]], and is a federation established under the [[Law of Switzerland]].\nIHF's supreme body is the [[IHF Congress]], an assembly made up of representatives from each affiliated member association. Each national handball association has one vote, regardless of its size or handballing strength. The Congress assembles in ordinary session once in two years (odd years) after the [[IHF World Men's Handball Championship]]. The congress makes decisions relating to IHF's governing statutes and their method of implementation and application. Only the Congress can pass changes to IHF's statutes. The congress approves the annual report, and decides on the acceptance of new national associations and holds elections. Congress elects the President of IHF, its General Secretary, and the other members of the [[IHF Council]].\nIHF's Council, chaired by the President, is the main decision-making body of the organisation in the intervals of Congress. The Council is composed of 18 people: the President, 5 Vice Presidents, and 12 members. The Council is the body that decides which country will host the World Championship.\nThe President and General Secretary are the main officeholders of IHF, and are in charge of its daily administration, carried out by the General Secretariat. Dr. [[Hassan Moustafa]] is the current president, appointed in the year 2000 at the 28th Ordinary [[IHF Congress]].\n\n===Six confederations and 209 national associations===\nThe IHF is composed of six continental federations which organize continental championships held every other second year: [[African Handball Confederation]], [[Asian Handball Federation]], [[European Handball Federation]], [[North America and the Caribbean Handball Confederation]], [[Oceania Continent Handball Federation]], and [[South and Central America Handball Confederation]]. In addition to continental competitions between national teams, the federations arrange international tournaments between club teams.<ref name=\"ihf-rules-I\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ihf.info/upload/Manual/IHF_STATUTS_CHAP_01_GB.pdf|title=Bylaws|date=September 2007|publisher=International Handball Federation|page=7|accessdate=2 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nUntil 2017, there were five continental confederations. On 14 January 2018, the IHF Council divided the Pan-American Confederation into the North America and the Caribbean Handball Confederation and the South and Central America Handball Confederation. The authority to divide a continental confederation was assigned to the [[IHF Congress]], but the 36th [[IHF Congress]] in 2017 authorized the IHF Council to divide the [[Pan-American Team Handball Federation]].<ref>{{cite news |title=IHF statement related to Pan-American continent |url=http://www.ihf.info/en-us/theihf/continentalfederations/europeanhandballfederation(ehf)/listoffederations/croatianhandballfederation/news/newsdetails.aspx?ID=5506 |publisher=IHF |date= 19 January 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==IHF Presidents==\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#2a4b8d\" align=\"center\" span style=\"color:white\"\n!S.

Seats were reserved for minorities in the national and provincial assemblies. Government officials stated that the separate electorates system is a form of [[affirmative action]] designed to ensure minority representation, and that efforts are underway to achieve a consensus among religious minorities on this issue, but critics argued that under this system Muslim candidates no longer had any incentive to pay attention to the minorities. Hindu community leader Sudham Chand protested against the system but was murdered. In 1999, Pakistan abolished this system.\nHindus and other minorities achieved a rare political victory in 2002 with the removal of separate electorates for Muslims and non-Muslims. The separate electorate system had marginalized non-Muslims by depriving them of adequate representation in the assemblies. The Pakistan Hindu Welfare Association was active by convening a national conference on the issue in December 2000. And in 2001, Hindus, Christians, and Ahmadis successfully conducted a partial boycott of the elections, culminating in the abolishment of the separate electorate system in 2002. This allowed religious minorities to vote for mainstream seats in the National and Provincial assemblies, rather than being confined to voting for only minority seats.

Seats were reserved for minorities in the national and provincial assemblies. Government officials stated that the separate electorates system is a form of [[affirmative action]] designed to ensure minority representation, and that efforts are underway to achieve a consensus among religious minorities on this issue, but critics argued that under this system Muslim candidates no longer had any incentive to pay attention to the minorities. Hindu community leader Sudham Chand protested against the system but was murdered. In 1999, Pakistan abolished this system.\nHindus and other minorities achieved a rare political victory in 2002 with the removal of separate electorates for Muslims and non-Muslims. The separate electorate system had marginalized non-Muslims by depriving them of adequate representation in the assemblies. The Pakistan Hindu Welfare Association was active by convening a national conference on the issue in December 2000. And in 2001, Hindus, Christians, and Ahmadis successfully conducted a partial boycott of the elections, culminating in the abolishment of the separate electorate system in 2002. This allowed religious minorities to vote for mainstream seats in the National and Provincial assemblies, rather than being confined to voting for only minority seats.
