The list does not include players who sat out at least one full season due to injury and then returned to play without having ever officially announced retirement, nor does it include free agents who were unable to find a team for at least a season and signed with a team at a later point without having ever officially announced retirement.\n\n== American football ==\n* [[Randall Cunningham]] (1985\u20131995, 1997\u20132001)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://athlonsports.com/nfl/20-athletes-who-retired-then-unretired?amp|title=20 Great Athletes Who Unretired {{!}} AthlonSports.com|website=athlonsports.com|access-date=2019-03-11}}</ref>\n* [[Brett Favre]] (1991\u20132007, 2008, 2009\u20132010)\n* [[Marshawn Lynch]] (2007\u20132015, 2017\u20132018, 2019)\n* [[Bronko Nagurski]] (1930\u20131937, 1943)<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43233688/|title=Bronko Takes Up Grid Wars Again|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=September 17, 1943|accessdate=January 29, 2020}}</ref>\n* [[Deion Sanders]] (1989\u20132000, 2004\u20132005)<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Reggie White]] (1984\u20131998, 2000)<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Jason Witten]] (2003\u20132017, 2019\u2013present)<ref>http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/26104542/witten-return-cowboys-leaving-mnf-booth</ref>\n*[[Rob Gronkowski]] (2010-2018, 2020-present)\n\n== Association football ==\n*[[Zico]] (1971\u20131989, 1991\u20131994)\n*[[Aldair]] (1986\u20132005, 2007\u20132008)\n*[[Roberto Carlos]] (1991\u20132012, 2015)\n*[[Dida (footballer, born 1973)|Dida]] (1992\u20132010, 2012\u20132015)\n*[[Paul Scholes]] (1993\u20132011, 2012\u20132013)\n*[[Walter Montillo]] (2002\u20132017, 2018\u2013)\n\n== Baseball ==\n* [[Yogi Berra]] (1946\u20131963, 1965)<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nelson |first1=Murry R. |title=American Sports: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas [4 volumes]: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas |date=2013 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-313-39753-0 |page=121 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tfTXAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA121&lpg=PA121 |accessdate=25 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Berra was a coach with the [[New York Mets]] when, in 1965, he played four games at [[catcher]].|group=\"notes\"}}\n* [[Jim Bouton]] (1962\u20131970, 1978)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/boutoji01.shtml|title=Jim Bouton Stats|website=Baseball-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref>\n* [[Ben Chapman (baseball)|Ben Chapman]] (1930\u20131941, 1944\u20131946)<ref name=\"siwwii\">{{cite news |last1=Jeanes |first1=William |title=Baseball in World War II |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1991/08/26/124797/baseball-in-world-war-ii-fdr-let-baseball-continue-so-we-had-a-pastime-played-by-graybeards-no-beards-and-other-marvels |accessdate=27 January 2020 |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=August 26, 1991 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Ben Chapman Stats |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/chapmbe01.shtml |website=[[Baseball-Reference.com]] |publisher=[[Sports Reference]] |accessdate=27 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n* [[David Cone]] (1986\u20132001, 2003)<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cone |first1=David |title=Full Count: The Education of a Pitcher |date=2019 |publisher=Grand Central Publishing |isbn=978-1-5387-4882-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FjVwDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT342&lpg=PT342 |accessdate=24 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n* [[Tony Conigliaro]] (1964\u20131971, 1975)<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pearson |first1=Richard |title=Tony Conigliaro, 45, Dies |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1990/02/26/tony-conigliaro-45-dies/63f0aabf-838c-4516-b5ce-c52d9811c269/ |accessdate=25 January 2020 |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=February 26, 1990}}</ref>\n* [[Dizzy Dean]] (1930\u20131941, 1947)<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cronin |first1=Brian |title=St. Louis Cardinals: Did Dizzy Dean come in from the radio booth to pitch a game for them?

She is the [[Figure skating at the 1976 Olympics|1976 Olympic champion]] and [[1976 World Figure Skating Championships|1976 World champion]] in ladies' singles.\n\n==Early life==\nHamill was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], to Chalmers and Carol Hamill. Her father was a mechanical engineer.<ref name=espn031119/> Shortly after her birth, her family moved to the Riverside neighborhood of [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], where Hamill spent the rest of her childhood. She has two older siblings, a brother, Sandy, and a sister, Marcia.<ref name=espn031119/>\n\nHamill first started skating in early 1965 at the age of 8, taking once-a-week group lessons. She became more serious about the sport the next season, taking regular private lessons and passing her preliminary and first figure test before the seasonal rink closed in March. She would wake early in the morning to go to the rink for practice at 4:30 am.<ref name=espn031119/> Hamill was first coached by [[Otto Gold]] and [[Gustave Lussi]]. Ice time was limited in her area, so she eventually began training at Sky Rink in [[New York City]], staying overnight in the city with friends when possible. In the summers, Hamill trained in [[Lake Placid, New York]] and later in [[Toronto]] with her coach at the time, [[Sonya Klopfer|Sonya Dunfield]].<ref name=competitor/> During her career, her father would spend up to $20,000 a year on her skating expenses, including skating lessons, travel, living expenses, and costumes.<ref name=espn031119/>\n\nUntil the spring of 1970, Hamill attended public schools in Riverside, but at that point she switched to a small school with flexible tutoring to accommodate her skating schedule. She attended and graduated from [[Colorado Academy]] high school.<ref name=competitor/>\n\n==Career==\nHamill's first national success came in 1969, when she won the novice ladies' title at the [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Championships]] at the age of 12. Later that spring, Hamill was invited to perform in [[Madison Square Garden]] with the exhibition tour (in later years known as [[Champions on Ice]]) that followed the [[1969 World Figure Skating Championships]]. She placed second at the junior level at the 1970 Championships, and made her senior debut in 1971.<ref name=competitor/> The [[U.S. Figure Skating Association]] arranged for her to be coached by [[Carlo Fassi]] when she began to compete internationally.<ref name=espn031119/>\n\nHamill was [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. champion]] from 1974 to 1976. At the 1974 World Championships in [[Munich, Germany]], she was in 3rd place after the [[compulsory figures]] and the short program. She was set to skate directly after the German skater [[Gerti Schanderl]], whose marks were booed while Hamill was already on the ice. Visibly upset, Hamill left the ice and burst into tears. After the crowd settled down, she returned to the ice and won the silver medal behind [[Christine Errath]] of East Germany.\n\nHamill competed with an injured right leg at the 1975 U.S. Championships.<ref name=CSGT750303/> She said her leg was fine after receiving treatment for a pulled hamstring (earlier believed to be pulled ligaments) while training in Denver during the month before the [[1975 World Figure Skating Championships|1975 World Championships]].<ref name=CSGT750303/> She won silver at Worlds in Colorado Springs, Colorado, behind [[Dianne de Leeuw]] of the Netherlands and ahead of Errath.\n\nHamill was disappointed by her performance at the 1976 U.S. Championships, admitting that she was outskated by [[Linda Fratianne]] because she had not trained properly. Immediately after the national championships, her coach [[Carlo Fassi]] left the U.S. to accompany his other star pupil, [[John Curry]], to the [[European Figure Skating Championships|European Championships]], leaving Hamill coachless with the Olympics only a few weeks away. She began training with Peter Burrows instead. She was pleased with their work together and wanted to bring him to the Olympics as her coach of record.<ref name=espn031119/> However, the USFSA refused her request, and she was reunited with Fassi for a brief period of training in Germany before the Olympics.<ref name=espn031119/><ref name=skatinglife/>\n\nAt the [[Figure skating at the 1976 Winter Olympics|1976 Winter Olympics]] in Innsbruck, Austria, Hamill came in second in the figures and then won the short and long programs, taking the gold medal. She was the last [[Single skating|single skater]] to win the Olympics without a triple jump.<ref name=espn031119/> Hamill also won the [[1976 World Figure Skating Championships|1976 World Championships]], and then turned professional.\n\nHamill is credited with developing a new skating move, a [[Figure skating spins|camel spin]] that turns into a [[Figure skating spins|sit spin]], which became known as the \"Hamill camel.\"<ref name=tpn121228/> The bobbed hairstyle that she wore during her Olympic performance was created by stylist Yusuke Suga <ref name=espn031119/> and started a fad, known as the \"short and sassy\" look.<ref name=hairfinder/> Her eyeglasses with oversized frames also started a trend in the 1970s.<ref name=espn031119/> The media dubbed her \"America's sweetheart.\"<ref name=tbs090922/>\n\nHamill was an [[Ice Capades]] headliner from 1977 to 1984. She was asked to join Ice Capades by Donna Atwood, who had been its star for years and who had eventually acquired financial control of the Ice Capades.

American [[figure skater]]. She is the [[Figure skating at the 1976 Olympics|1976 Olympic champion]] and [[1976 World Figure Skating Championships|1976 World champion]] in ladies' singles.\n\n==Early life==\nHamill was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], to Chalmers and Carol Hamill. Her father was a mechanical engineer.<ref name=espn031119/> Shortly after her birth, her family moved to the Riverside neighborhood of [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], where Hamill spent the rest of her childhood. She has two older siblings, a brother, Sandy, and a sister, Marcia.<ref name=espn031119/>\n\nHamill first started skating in early 1965 at the age of 8, taking once-a-week group lessons. She became more serious about the sport the next season, taking regular private lessons and passing her preliminary and first figure test before the seasonal rink closed in March. She would wake early in the morning to go to the rink for practice at 4:30 am.<ref name=espn031119/> Hamill was first coached by [[Otto Gold]] and [[Gustave Lussi]]. Ice time was limited in her area, so she eventually began training at Sky Rink in [[New York City]], staying overnight in the city with friends when possible. In the summers, Hamill trained in [[Lake Placid, New York]] and later in [[Toronto]] with her coach at the time, [[Sonya Klopfer|Sonya Dunfield]].<ref name=competitor/> During her career, her father would spend up to $20,000 a year on her skating expenses, including skating lessons, travel, living expenses, and costumes.<ref name=espn031119/>\n\nUntil the spring of 1970, Hamill attended public schools in Riverside, but at that point she switched to a small school with flexible tutoring to accommodate her skating schedule. She attended and graduated from [[Colorado Academy]] high school.<ref name=competitor/>\n\n==Career==\nHamill's first national success came in 1969, when she won the novice ladies' title at the [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Championships]] at the age of 12. Later that spring, Hamill was invited to perform in [[Madison Square Garden]] with the exhibition tour (in later years known as [[Champions on Ice]]) that followed the [[1969 World Figure Skating Championships]]. She placed second at the junior level at the 1970 Championships, and made her senior debut in 1971.<ref name=competitor/> The [[U.S. Figure Skating Association]] arranged for her to be coached by [[Carlo Fassi]] when she began to compete internationally.<ref name=espn031119/>\n\nHamill was [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. champion]] from 1974 to 1976. At the 1974 World Championships in [[Munich, Germany]], she was in 3rd place after the [[compulsory figures]] and the short program. She was set to skate directly after the German skater [[Gerti Schanderl]], whose marks were booed while Hamill was already on the ice. Visibly upset, Hamill left the ice and burst into tears. After the crowd settled down, she returned to the ice and won the silver medal behind [[Christine Errath]] of East Germany.\n\nHamill competed with an injured right leg at the 1975 U.S. Championships.<ref name=CSGT750303/> She said her leg was fine after receiving treatment for a pulled hamstring (earlier believed to be pulled ligaments) while training in Denver during the month before the [[1975 World Figure Skating Championships|1975 World Championships]].<ref name=CSGT750303/> She won silver at Worlds in Colorado Springs, Colorado, behind [[Dianne de Leeuw]] of the Netherlands and ahead of Errath.\n\nHamill was disappointed by her performance at the 1976 U.S. Championships, admitting that she was outskated by [[Linda Fratianne]] because she had not trained properly. Immediately after the national championships, her coach [[Carlo Fassi]] left the U.S. to accompany his other star pupil, [[John Curry]], to the [[European Figure Skating Championships|European Championships]], leaving Hamill coachless with the Olympics only a few weeks away. She began training with Peter Burrows instead. She was pleased with their work together and wanted to bring him to the Olympics as her coach of record.<ref name=espn031119/> However, the USFSA refused her request, and she was reunited with Fassi for a brief period of training in Germany before the Olympics.<ref name=espn031119/><ref name=skatinglife/>\n\nAt the [[Figure skating at the 1976 Winter Olympics|1976 Winter Olympics]] in Innsbruck, Austria, Hamill came in second in the figures and then won the short and long programs, taking the gold medal. She was the last [[Single skating|single skater]] to win the Olympics without a triple jump.<ref name=espn031119/> Hamill also won the [[1976 World Figure Skating Championships|1976 World Championships]], and then turned professional.\n\nHamill is credited with developing a new skating move, a [[Figure skating spins|camel spin]] that turns into a [[Figure skating spins|sit spin]], which became known as the \"Hamill camel.\"<ref name=tpn121228/> The bobbed hairstyle that she wore during her Olympic performance was created by stylist Yusuke Suga <ref name=espn031119/> and started a fad, known as the \"short and sassy\" look.<ref name=hairfinder/> Her eyeglasses with oversized frames also started a trend in the 1970s.<ref name=espn031119/> The media dubbed her \"America's sweetheart.\"<ref name=tbs090922/>\n\nHamill was an [[Ice Capades]] headliner from 1977 to 1984. She was asked to join Ice Capades by Donna Atwood, who had been its star for years and who had eventually acquired financial control of the Ice Capades. Hamill was asked to be Atwood's successor as its new star.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.kabbage.com/blog/worst-celebrity-investments\n|title=The 7 Worst Celebrity Investments\n|accessdate=2013-04-28\n|website=Kabbage}}</ref> After Ice Capades folded due to competition and changing tastes, Hamill and her husband bought the financially strapped company's assets in 1993 in an effort to revive its earlier success, but they declared bankruptcy in 1994.
