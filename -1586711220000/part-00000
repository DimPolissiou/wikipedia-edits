In 2009, due to the contentious nature of the presidential elections, and the rise of the green party movement, internet crackdowns have become far more strict.\n\nNonetheless, {{as of|2009|lc=y}}, according to the CIA world factbook, 8.214 million internet users in Iran, ranked 35th in the world.<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html</ref> Blogs range from updates on art and critiquing movies, to following injustices of political prisoners. Diasporic [[Persian language|Persian]] and Iranian blogs have also become a trend as a means to be part of an international online community. Blogs may be used as a virtual means of social protest without assembly, such as when thousands of bloggers renamed their blogs Akbar Ganji for a week in 2005, in support of the arrested critic of the regime. Hossien Derakhshan, the unofficial \"godfather\" of the blogosphere, set his up in Canada in September 2001. He was later arrested. In 2011, Iranian authorities executed more than 600 people and imprisoned more journalists and bloggers than any other country.<ref>Human rights watch https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/01/22/iran-authorities-defiant-rights-record</ref>\n\n==Scope==\nThe broad usage of weblogs in Iran was staggering. {{As of|2004}}, the [[NITLE]] (National Institute for Technology in Liberal Education)blog census found the number of blogs in [[Persian language|Persian]] surpassed 64,000.<ref name=NITLE/> Some believe that the influence of these blogs have been exaggerated, in that their authors are predominantly upper and upper-middle class. However, the education system in Iran gives access to education and therefore new technologies, computers and the internet as a whole to large numbers of lower-class people.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n==Appeal==\nBlogs often give a sense of anonymity.\n\n==Political importance==\nBlogging in Iran took on political importance as the regime continued its crackdown on journalists. The Iranian press is highly regulated, especially under the Press Law, which according to the UNHCR, \"forbids the publication of ideas that are contrary to Islamic principles or detrimental to public rights.\" This includes imprisonment for \"propaganda,\" which remains undefined, and for offenses that are \"an insult to religion.\"\n\nBecause as many as 100 publications were shut down in the early 2000s, many sought alternative outlets for reporting and freedom of expression. This often came about in critiques of the regime, which was relatively unregulated until 2004. Implicit and explicit condemnation is common, such as is evident in the following excerpts. \n<blockquote>\"11 July 2003: On occasion something happens in life that makes you want to believe in miracles. Like today! Coming across a copy of Kieslowski's Three colours Blue/ White/ Red among the videos at home- without anyone remembering having borrowed it from a friend... This was one of those majestic miracles that only a higher being can bestow on a special someone like me. Thank You God!\"<ref>Alavi, Nasrin. \" We are Iran\" p 226 email pendram_kiano@yahoo.com {{cite web|url=http://natoor.persianblog.com |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815154538/http://natoor.persianblog.com/ |archivedate=2014-08-15 }}</ref></blockquote> The viewing of movies in ones home is forbidden, as are most western films. More explicit expressions of dissent as also common: \"25 November 2002: Every Day new intrigues and tyrannies by our repressive turbaned rulers...And crazy Muslims around the world that bring nothing but carnage and shame...I swear to god...if it weren't for clergy like Eshkavari who keep telling us that what they do is not Islam...I would abandon this little faith once and for all\"<ref>Alavi, Nasrin. \"We are Iran\" p. 110 Soft Skull Press, 2005.</ref>\n\nIranian officials became concerned that the 2004 [[Orange Revolution]] in Ukraine might induce foreign attempts to support a similar revolution in Iran, by building civil society networks and empowering activists as had happened in Ukraine. This was compounded by the 2006 announcement by the [[U.S. State Department]] that it was creating a $75 million fund to \"reach out to the people of Iran\". This caused the Iranian government to closely monitor foreign support for bloggers and journalists.<ref name=ipsnews-20070213>{{cite news |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=36393 |title=Journalists Targeted for Traveling Outside Iran |last=Memarian |first=Omid |website=Inter Press Service News Agency |date=13 February 2007 |accessdate=18 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004 the government began to arrest and charge bloggers as political dissidents.

Critical publications were shut down and the largest number of journalists were jailed since the 1979 revolution. The Press Law was also formally extended to \"all internet publications\" which may include blogs, requiring the authors to get licenses. According to ONI, with the sophisticated system of internet filtering developed by Iran, the websites Blogger and Persianblog are often blocked. Yet in response to the vitality of the Iranian blogosphere, the government decided to pursue other tactics simultaneously, announcing in late 2008 its intention to create thousands of pro government blogs, including one by the president himself.<ref name=unhcr>http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,FREEHOU,,IRN,,4ca5cc5f1e,0.html{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Thus the internet, and in particular blogs became an important front in informal political debate, declarations, and dissatisfaction.\n\n==Hossein Derakhshan==\nBorn in Iran in 1975, [[Hossein Derakhshan]], commonly referred to as the \"blogging godfather\" or the \"blogfather,\" moved to Canada in 2000. His blog became the first [[Persian language|Persian]] blog, and took off in 2001 with his simple instruction manual on how to set up and write a Persian-language blog. In 2003 his blog became highly political, encouraging opposition through writing.\n\nIn 2006 he went back to the middle east, visited Egypt and met with Egyptian blogger when the Egyptian blogosphere was also at its peak activity. In the same tour Hissein visited Israel publicly, seeking to mend relations between Iran and Israel, which are sworn enemies. In the same year, he also backed presidential candidate Ahmadinejad. In 2008 he was arrested while visiting family in Iran and was sentenced to 19 and a half years in prison, banned from political party membership for five years,  and ordered to repay earnings of around $44,500 for \"propagating against the regime\" and \"co-operating with hostile states.\" In 2010 he was temporarily released on bail of 1.5 million dollars.<ref>\"Iran Blogger Hossien Derakhshan Temporarily Released.\" BBC News. BBC, 9 Dec. 2010. Web. 20 Apr. 2012. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11962032.</ref>\n\n==[[Shirin Ebadi]] nobel peace prize news==\nThe power of the Iranian blogs was demonstrated in 2003, with the Iranian human rights lawyer Shirin Ebadi winning the Nobel Peace Prize. Because her human rights work had much to do with representing women, children, and dissidents against the regime, the official Iranian news failed to report the win. Several hours later it included in the nightly news a 15-second mention of the win, while failing to report her actual accomplishments aside for \"a children's charity.\" Rather than traditional channels, therefore, the news and reactions to it spread on multiple blogs. Nasrin Alavi, author of We Are Iran, brings the statistics of www.damasanj.com, a website which works out which stories are most talked about in the Iranian blogosphere,  which found that Ebadi dominated the top ten Rankings.8 Most were congratulatory, and sought to provide bios and facts on the nature of Ebadi's work, which the traditional press had failed to print. \nBloggers went a step farther when they organized a reception for Ebadi at the Teheran airport upon her return on October 14, 2003. They called for people to celebrate her victory, as well as use the venue to protest the current situation of women's rights and oppression. Rather than the media, it was bloggers that provided up to date pictures of the reception to the public. Thousands of people attended, proving that bloggers could translate to actual events. Eventually this forced the government to respond to Ebadi's Prize in a more serious light: it cast Ebadi as an apostate and a member of a foreign conspiracy against Iran.<ref>Alavi, Nasrin. \"We are Iran\" P. 280-289</ref>\n\n==Bam==\nThe December [[2003 Bam earthquake]] caused particular outrage and made clear the necessity for blogging as a news source. While the regime was ill-equipped to deal with the disaster where an estimated 30,000 people lost their lives. The aftermath was tremendous in damages, and a lack of journalists to cover the quake. Blogs, therefore, became a central source of information. For example, Dr. Marajan Haj-Ahmadi's blog became one of the most read, as she was based in the bordering city of Kerman and was able to report from the area and provide information as to the medical inadequacies. Others included Baba's blog, an anonymous ex-newspaper journalist who entered the region to provide accurate news reports from the disaster zone. The survivors of the Bam earthquake also began protesting due to lack of governmental support, which went unreported in the official news but the shooting of two individuals at a Friday prayer was reported by bloggers.\n\nIn her book \"We are Iran: The Persian Blogs\" Nasrin Alavi claims that the earthquake was a turning point for blogs being organizing forces as well as partnering with NGO's rather than governmental organizations:\n{{quotation|Bloggers like 'Shineh' got involved in a variety of NGOs organizing their own collection points and the transportation of aid in many parts of Iran. They were sometimes able to notify their fellow bloggers of the whereabouts of survivors relocated to hospitals in urban centers. They organized hospital visits, charity sales, and recruited volunteers ready to help in Bam|(p. 260)}}\nThe translation from a virtual page into actual human mobility lent legitimacy to the blogger movement, as well as proving it to be a resilient form of networking that had practical applications. It also proved the fears of the government in that it began to resemble a movement rather than simply disconnected expressions of personal experiences.\n\n===Transition to Facebook===\nWhile blogging remains a key form of political protest, in the 2009 uprisings, Facebook began to take a more central role. The physical, rather than virtual protests spread through word-of-mouth rather than blogs. When possible, instances of police abuse were captured on mobile phone videos and then uploaded to YouTube, most famously the video of Neda Agha Soltan being shot to death in the streets of Teheran. These videos were shared on Facebook, fueling the protests. Originally blocked by the government in 2006, it had been unblocked in 2009, just months before the protests.<ref>http://www.rferl.org/content/Irans_Green_Movement_And_New_Media/2068714.html</ref>\n\n==Language: the Use of English and other foreign languages==\nMore recently, Persian has become just one of many Iranian blog languages. English in particular is used. This is both because it is a relatively well known second language due to high education levels, and to expose the outside world to the goings on in Iran. Several influential bloggers made a plea to other bloggers to use this medium to increase international outrage at the Iranian regime. It also seeks to provide a lens from which to see the Iranian people as separate from their repressive government. Additionally, many blogs being read are written abroad by diasporic communities of Iranians throughout the globe. Many of their families left during the Brain-drain following the Islamic revolution in 1979 and after, creating a dedicated politically motivated and educated author base. These people use their native or adopted languages in addition to Persian.\n\n==Women in blogging==\nSome of the most popular Iranian bloggers are women. The outlet often provides a means to escape the need to identify oneself openly, particularly as family honor can be associated with women. The internet provides a means to talk about the restrictions on women, including the mandatory Hijab. Women can communicate with men openly as contributors of commentators on each other's blog, even having virtual boyfriends online. They can talk about premarital sex, underground parties, alcohol and other youth activities often frowned upon or considered illegal. It also allows for following fashion trends, music, and feminist news. For example, one blogger addresses the issue of prostitution under the regime, which is formally denied. \"22 August 2003: some facts: The rate of runaway girls has grown 20 times between the periods of 1986-1999, with the average age of girls now 14.7...the average age of prostitutes has dropped from 27 to 20 years.\" Due to the extremely high education rate of women, females even surpassing males in enrollment in university, access and literacy are readily available. Some popular female bloggers include\n2003 student uprisings Iran\nIn 2003 there were a series of student uprisings throughout the country, despite widespread repression during 1999 riots. largely reported on blogs, providing news and updates for others, while it was not being reported by the press. This allowed for more organized, planned protests. Eventually they too were repressed, but not without using the internet and blogs as a means to defy authority.\n\n==Timeline==\n\n===2001===\n* 7 September - The first Persian blog is published by [[Hossein Derakhshan]], using manual coding.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4973862,00.html | title = The land of Goder and Ferfer, blogging with a Persian accent  | work = DW-World | date = 2009-12-07 | accessdate = 2010-01-11 }}</ref>\n* 25 September - The blog using manual coding is published.\n* 5 November - Instructions on \"How to make a blog in Persian\" using [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]'s free service is published, in response to readers' requests.\n\n===2002===\n* 2 June - Cappuccino magazine is launched.<!-- notable? -->\n* 13 June - PersianBlog.com, the first free blog service in Persian, is launched.

In 2009, due to the contentious nature of the presidential elections, and the rise of the green party movement, internet crackdowns have become far more strict.\n\nNonetheless, {{as of|2009|lc=y}}, according to the CIA world factbook, 8.214 million internet users in Iran, ranked 35th in the world.<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html</ref> Blogs range from updates on art and critiquing movies, to following injustices of political prisoners. Diasporic [[Persian language|Persian]] and Iranian blogs have also become a trend as a means to be part of an international online community. Blogs may be used as a virtual means of social protest without assembly, such as when thousands of bloggers renamed their blogs Akbar Ganji for a week in 2005, in support of the arrested critic of the regime. Hossien Derakhshan, the unofficial \"godfather\" of the blogosphere, set his up in Canada in September 2001. He was later arrested. In 2011, Iranian authorities executed more than 600 people and imprisoned more journalists and bloggers than any other country.<ref>Human rights watch https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/01/22/iran-authorities-defiant-rights-record</ref>\n\n==Scope==\nThe broad usage of weblogs in Iran was staggering. {{As of|2004}}, the [[NITLE]] (National Institute for Technology in Liberal Education)blog census found the number of blogs in [[Persian language|Persian]] surpassed 64,000.<ref name=NITLE/> Some believe that the influence of these blogs have been exaggerated, in that their authors are predominantly upper and upper-middle class. However, the education system in Iran gives access to education and therefore new technologies, computers and the internet as a whole to large numbers of lower-class people.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n==Appeal==\nBlogs often give a sense of anonymity.\n\n==Political importance==\nBlogging in Iran took on political importance as the regime continued its crackdown on journalists. The Iranian press is highly regulated, especially under the Press Law, which according to the UNHCR, \"forbids the publication of ideas that are contrary to Islamic principles or detrimental to public rights.\" This includes imprisonment for \"propaganda,\" which remains undefined, and for offenses that are \"an insult to religion.\"\n\nBecause as many as 100 publications were shut down in the early 2000s, many sought alternative outlets for reporting and freedom of expression. This often came about in critiques of the regime, which was relatively unregulated until 2004. Implicit and explicit condemnation is common, such as is evident in the following excerpts. \n<blockquote>\"11 July 2003: On occasion something happens in life that makes you want to believe in miracles. Like today! Coming across a copy of Kieslowski's Three colours Blue/ White/ Red among the videos at home- without anyone remembering having borrowed it from a friend... This was one of those majestic miracles that only a higher being can bestow on a special someone like me.

More explicit expressions of dissent as also common: \"25 November 2002: Every Day new intrigues and tyrannies by our repressive turbaned rulers...And crazy Muslims around the world that bring nothing but carnage and shame...I swear to god...if it weren't for clergy like Eshkavari who keep telling us that what they do is not Islam...I would abandon this little faith once and for all\"<ref>Alavi, Nasrin. \"We are Iran\" p. 110 Soft Skull Press, 2005.</ref>\n\nIranian officials became concerned that the 2004 [[Orange Revolution]] in Ukraine might induce foreign attempts to support a similar revolution in Iran, by building civil society networks and empowering activists as had happened in Ukraine. This was compounded by the 2006 announcement by the [[U.S. State Department]] that it was creating a $75 million fund to \"reach out to the people of Iran\". This caused the Iranian government to closely monitor foreign support for bloggers and journalists.<ref name=ipsnews-20070213>{{cite news |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=36393 |title=Journalists Targeted for Traveling Outside Iran |last=Memarian |first=Omid |website=Inter Press Service News Agency |date=13 February 2007 |accessdate=18 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004 the government began to arrest and charge bloggers as political dissidents.

Critical publications were shut down and the largest number of journalists were jailed since the 1979 revolution. The Press Law was also formally extended to \"all internet publications\" which may include blogs, requiring the authors to get licenses. According to ONI, with the sophisticated system of internet filtering developed by Iran, the websites Blogger and Persianblog are often blocked. Yet in response to the vitality of the Iranian blogosphere, the government decided to pursue other tactics simultaneously, announcing in late 2008 its intention to create thousands of pro government blogs, including one by the president himself.<ref name=unhcr>http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,FREEHOU,,IRN,,4ca5cc5f1e,0.html{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Thus the internet, and in particular blogs became an important front in informal political debate, declarations, and dissatisfaction.\n\n==Hossein Derakhshan==\nBorn in Iran in 1975, [[Hossein Derakhshan]], commonly referred to as the \"blogging godfather\" or the \"blogfather,\" moved to Canada in 2000. His blog became the first [[Persian language|Persian]] blog, and took off in 2001 with his simple instruction manual on how to set up and write a Persian-language blog. In 2003 his blog became highly political, encouraging opposition through writing.\n\nIn 2006 he went back to the middle east, visited Egypt and met with Egyptian blogger when the Egyptian blogosphere was also at its peak activity. In the same tour Hissein visited Israel publicly, seeking to mend relations between Iran and Israel, which are sworn enemies. In the same year, he also backed presidential candidate Ahmadinejad. In 2008 he was arrested while visiting family in Iran and was sentenced to 19 and a half years in prison, banned from political party membership for five years,  and ordered to repay earnings of around $44,500 for \"propagating against the regime\" and \"co-operating with hostile states.\" In 2010 he was temporarily released on bail of 1.5 million dollars.<ref>\"Iran Blogger Hossien Derakhshan Temporarily Released.\" BBC News.

Web. 20 Apr. 2012. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11962032.</ref>\n\n==[[Shirin Ebadi]] nobel peace prize news==\nThe power of the Iranian blogs was demonstrated in 2003, with the Iranian human rights lawyer Shirin Ebadi winning the Nobel Peace Prize. Because her human rights work had much to do with representing women, children, and dissidents against the regime, the official Iranian news failed to report the win. Several hours later it included in the nightly news a 15-second mention of the win, while failing to report her actual accomplishments aside for \"a children's charity.\" Rather than traditional channels, therefore, the news and reactions to it spread on multiple blogs. Nasrin Alavi, author of We Are Iran, brings the statistics of www.damasanj.com, a website which works out which stories are most talked about in the Iranian blogosphere,  which found that Ebadi dominated the top ten Rankings.8 Most were congratulatory, and sought to provide bios and facts on the nature of Ebadi's work, which the traditional press had failed to print. \nBloggers went a step farther when they organized a reception for Ebadi at the Teheran airport upon her return on October 14, 2003. They called for people to celebrate her victory, as well as use the venue to protest the current situation of women's rights and oppression. Rather than the media, it was bloggers that provided up to date pictures of the reception to the public. Thousands of people attended, proving that bloggers could translate to actual events. Eventually this forced the government to respond to Ebadi's Prize in a more serious light: it cast Ebadi as an apostate and a member of a foreign conspiracy against Iran.<ref>Alavi, Nasrin. \"We are Iran\" P. 280-289</ref>\n\n==Bam==\nThe December [[2003 Bam earthquake]] caused particular outrage and made clear the necessity for blogging as a news source. While the regime was ill-equipped to deal with the disaster where an estimated 30,000 people lost their lives. The aftermath was tremendous in damages, and a lack of journalists to cover the quake. Blogs, therefore, became a central source of information. For example, Dr. Marajan Haj-Ahmadi's blog became one of the most read, as she was based in the bordering city of Kerman and was able to report from the area and provide information as to the medical inadequacies. Others included Baba's blog, an anonymous ex-newspaper journalist who entered the region to provide accurate news reports from the disaster zone. The survivors of the Bam earthquake also began protesting due to lack of governmental support, which went unreported in the official news but the shooting of two individuals at a Friday prayer was reported by bloggers.\n\nIn her book \"We are Iran: The Persian Blogs\" Nasrin Alavi claims that the earthquake was a turning point for blogs being organizing forces as well as partnering with NGO's rather than governmental organizations:\n{{quotation|Bloggers like 'Shineh' got involved in a variety of NGOs organizing their own collection points and the transportation of aid in many parts of Iran. They were sometimes able to notify their fellow bloggers of the whereabouts of survivors relocated to hospitals in urban centers. They organized hospital visits, charity sales, and recruited volunteers ready to help in Bam|(p. 260)}}\nThe translation from a virtual page into actual human mobility lent legitimacy to the blogger movement, as well as proving it to be a resilient form of networking that had practical applications. It also proved the fears of the government in that it began to resemble a movement rather than simply disconnected expressions of personal experiences.\n\n===Transition to Facebook===\nWhile blogging remains a key form of political protest, in the 2009 uprisings, Facebook began to take a more central role. The physical, rather than virtual protests spread through word-of-mouth rather than blogs. When possible, instances of police abuse were captured on mobile phone videos and then uploaded to YouTube, most famously the video of Neda Agha Soltan being shot to death in the streets of Teheran. These videos were shared on Facebook, fueling the protests. Originally blocked by the government in 2006, it had been unblocked in 2009, just months before the protests.<ref>http://www.rferl.org/content/Irans_Green_Movement_And_New_Media/2068714.html</ref>\n\n==Language: the Use of English and other foreign languages==\nMore recently, Persian has become just one of many Iranian blog languages. English in particular is used. This is both because it is a relatively well known second language due to high education levels, and to expose the outside world to the goings on in Iran. Several influential bloggers made a plea to other bloggers to use this medium to increase international outrage at the Iranian regime. It also seeks to provide a lens from which to see the Iranian people as separate from their repressive government. Additionally, many blogs being read are written abroad by diasporic communities of Iranians throughout the globe. Many of their families left during the Brain-drain following the Islamic revolution in 1979 and after, creating a dedicated politically motivated and educated author base. These people use their native or adopted languages in addition to Persian.\n\n==Women in blogging==\nSome of the most popular Iranian bloggers are women. The outlet often provides a means to escape the need to identify oneself openly, particularly as family honor can be associated with women. The internet provides a means to talk about the restrictions on women, including the mandatory Hijab. Women can communicate with men openly as contributors of commentators on each other's blog, even having virtual boyfriends online. They can talk about premarital sex, underground parties, alcohol and other youth activities often frowned upon or considered illegal. It also allows for following fashion trends, music, and feminist news. For example, one blogger addresses the issue of prostitution under the regime, which is formally denied. \"22 August 2003: some facts: The rate of runaway girls has grown 20 times between the periods of 1986-1999, with the average age of girls now 14.7...the average age of prostitutes has dropped from 27 to 20 years.\" Due to the extremely high education rate of women, females even surpassing males in enrollment in university, access and literacy are readily available. Some popular female bloggers include\n2003 student uprisings Iran\nIn 2003 there were a series of student uprisings throughout the country, despite widespread repression during 1999 riots. largely reported on blogs, providing news and updates for others, while it was not being reported by the press. This allowed for more organized, planned protests. Eventually they too were repressed, but not without using the internet and blogs as a means to defy authority.\n\n==Timeline==\n\n===2001===\n* 7 September - The first Persian blog is published by [[Hossein Derakhshan]], using manual coding.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4973862,00.html | title = The land of Goder and Ferfer, blogging with a Persian accent  | work = DW-World | date = 2009-12-07 | accessdate = 2010-01-11 }}</ref>\n* 25 September - The blog using manual coding is published.\n* 5 November - Instructions on \"How to make a blog in Persian\" using [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]'s free service is published, in response to readers' requests.\n\n===2002===\n* 2 June - Cappuccino magazine is launched.<!-- notable? -->\n* 13 June - PersianBlog.com, the first free blog service in Persian, is launched.

He first appeared in ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' #1 (May 1996), and was created by [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]]. In 2009, Magog was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 75th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/75.html Magog is number 75] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509075950/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/75.html |date=May 9, 2009 }} [[IGN]]. Retrieved 10-05-09.</ref> In ''Kingdom Come'', Magog's lack of conventional heroic qualities of idealism puts him at odds with Superman's morality.  After taking over Superman's place within the world's superhero community, his reckless actions with other would-be superheroes ultimately caused a nuclear disaster in the [[Midwestern United States]]; overwhelmed by guilt, he then realizes that Superman was right and seeks to atone for his crimes. In 2008, a parallel universe version of the character is introduced in DC Comics' main continuity; his destiny seemingly parallel to the original version's and some fear him due to their awareness of his counterpart's actions, yet granting him a benefit of doubt to prove himself as a true hero differing from his doppelg\u00e4nger.\n\n==Publication history==\n===Creation and development===\nMagog debuted in the first issue of the [[Elseworlds]] mini-series ''Kingdom Come'' in May 1996.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=190}}</ref> Within this possible future, he represents the violent, modern-style heroes who come into conflict with the classic, moralistic heroes of the past.\n\n''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' is a [[graphic novel]] rife with [[bible|biblical]] references. [[Gog and Magog]] are both biblical characters from the [[Book of Genesis]], the [[Book of Ezekiel]], and the [[Book of Revelation]] as well as names that appear in a variety of subsequent legends. In addition to taking his name from the [[Old Testament]], Magog represents the [[Golden calf]], that is, a [[idolatry#False idol|false idol]].{{deadlink|date=August 2013}}<ref name=keystothekingdom>[http://www.captionbox.net/keystokingdom/magog.html \"Keys to the Kingdom\" - Magog] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050110010727/http://www.captionbox.net/keystokingdom/magog.html |date=January 10, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nThe character's appearance was based on that of the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].<ref name=WizadXtra>Brick, Scott (March 2007). \"Alex Ross\".

[[Alex Ross]] stated, \"As I remember, Mark originally told me, 'Make him look like everything we hate in modern superhero design.'\"<ref name=keystothekingdom /> Ross has gone into more detail in an interview with [[Comic Book Resources]]:\n\n{{cquote|That's a character that Mark Waid invented that was really just put to me like come up with the most God awful, Rob Liefeld sort of design that you can.

I'm having a lot of fun with it....what struck me was that, underlying all the glitz and the armor and all, this guy is still a soldier. He's David Reid, lance corporal. So I thought about how I could apply a real hardcore military mindset to a superhero and get into his head.}}\n\n[[Scott Kolins]] took over the series with issue #11 as both writer and artist. However, the planned five-issue story was cut to two when the series was canceled with issue #12 because of low sales, but the story would be finished in a double-sized issue of ''Justice Society of America Special'' #1.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jeffrey |last=Renaud |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=26342 |title=Scott Kolins Talks \"Magog\"  |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=May 24, 2010 |accessdate=May 25, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===''Kingdom Come''===\nMagog, \"The New Man of Tomorrow,\" is a hero with a rising career in the last days of [[Superman (Kingdom Come)|Superman]]'s declining popularity. His true origins are never revealed in the story. His most controversial act at the time was killing the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], who was in custody for the murder of [[Lois Lane]] and dozens of other members of the ''[[Daily Planet]]''.  Magog then surrenders to Superman and the authorities. When put on trial for murder, Magog is acquitted, the feeling being that it is time for psychotic super-villains like the Joker to be killed off rather than preserve the belief of heroes of Superman's generation that all life is sacred no matter what the crime or risk of [[recidivism]].\n\nSuperman publicly denounces Magog and the acquittal, prompting Magog to challenge him to a fight. Superman, disgusted with the verdict, refuses the challenge and instead goes into self-imposed exile. During the next ten years, a new generation of heroes following Magog's violent approach begins to arise. Magog himself begins operating with a team of heroes known as the Justice Battalion (a group composed of characters based on the heroes of [[Charlton Comics]], who also inspired Alan Moore's ''[[Watchmen]]''). During a one-sided and unnecessarily brutal battle with the villainous [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]], Magog's teammate [[Captain Atom]] is critically injured, causing him to explode with the force of an atomic bomb. This disaster leaves [[Kansas]] completely destroyed, over a million people killed, and much of America's heartland is covered in deadly radiation, destabilizing the American economy.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |page=232}}</ref>\n\nMagog and [[Metal Men|Alloy]] are the only survivors of the Kansas blast. This cataclysm is the event which finally draws Superman and many of the heroes of his generation out of retirement, thus leading to the story's inevitable generational conflict. Initially, Magog is considered the most wanted and dangerous criminal in the world and is hunted by Superman's new [[Justice League]]. They finally confront him as he tries with little success to put some small order back amongst the ruins of Kansas. Superman goads him with the remark \"You must be proud (of this destruction)\", which results in Magog lashing out at the Man of Steel, blaming him for the present crisis since he would not adapt to modern ways. After the attack fails to harm Superman, Magog quietly surrenders. It becomes apparent that he is traumatized by his experience and seeks forgiveness.\n\nHe is taken into custody by the League and held in their special prison where he and others are lectured about their violent ways, although Magog appears to spend most of his time remorsefully in his cell. However, the jail's walls are pierced by a brainwashed [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and in the battle that follows, Magog noticeably avoids fighting and just sticks to saving as many lives as he can. At the end of ''Kingdom Come'', Magog retires to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Paradise Island]], where he is seen caring for the crippled Japanese superheroine Tokyo Rose, and giving Swastika a hard clout when he fails to show proper respect to [[Wonder Woman]] and the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]]. In the [[Elliot S! Maggin]] novelization, it is revealed that Magog even becomes the Dean of Students at [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]].\n\n===''Justice Society of America''===\n[[Lance Corporal]] '''David Reid''', great-grandson of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], was with the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] platoon assigned to halt the looting of the National Museum of Iraq during the Iraq War. Reid tracked one of the looters and found an artifact that was a stone fragment of the Old God Gog. Upon touching it, Reid blacked out, waking up three weeks later to find that he was now filled with [[Plasma (physics)|plasma energy]] and that a mark shaped like the [[Eye of Providence]] had opened up on his left arm. With the aid of a pointed hand-held device (which earned him the nickname '''\"Lance\"'''), Reid was able to project focused blasts of energy.\n\nBecause the modern Justice Society of America tries to keep the legacies of former heroes alive, and because Franklin Roosevelt was credited with bringing the JSA together in the first place, the Society asked Reid to join them.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #12 (March 2008). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen the Justice Society encounters the Third World survivor [[Gog (DC Comics)|Gog]], several of their number have themselves \"healed\" by him. When Gog sets out to save a village from a rogue military attack, the JSA assist him. During the conflict, Lance is struck by an RPG missile and killed. Gog stands over Lance and brings him back to life, replacing his ruined left arm and right eye with gold metal. Gog then dubs Reid Magog.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #18 (September 2008). DC Comics.</ref> Thankful for Gog's gift, Magog then leads half of the Justice Society in support of Gog, using his staff to send the members who don't agree with Gog's ways back to the Justice Society's headquarters.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #19 (October 2008). DC Comics.</ref> The Justice Society discovers that Gog is rooting himself to the Earth, which would cause the planet's destruction if he were ever to leave, and seek to destroy Gog to prevent this. Magog protects Gog until he sees him remove the gifts he gave to the Justice Society and use the corpses of [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mister Terrific]]'s wife and [[Alan Scott]]'s [[Jade (comics)|daughter]] to torture them. Magog then turns on Gog as well.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #21 (November 2008). DC Comics.</ref> Gog orders Magog to serve him or have his gift of life taken from him. Magog refuses, saying that he would rather die than live without freedom. The Society finally manages to topple Gog, and Magog beheads Gog with his staff. After Gog's head is removed from his body, his effects on the Justice Society are reversed, except for Magog, who for some reason remains in his altered state.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #22 (December 2008).

DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===''JSA All-Stars''===\nAfter the split that occurs in the Justice Society, Magog forms and joins the newly formed All-Stars (a team composed mostly of the Justice Society's younger heroes), alongside Power Girl, and helps lead the team along with her. The team has a new ongoing series beginning December 2, 2009, written by Matt Sturges and illustrated by Freddie Williams II.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/comics/jsa-all-stars-2009/jsa-all-stars-1|title=JSA ALL-STARS #1}}</ref>\n\n===Solo series===\nIn September 2009, a Magog solo series was launched, written by Keith Giffen and illustrated by Howard Porter. The series, while loosely tied into the events of ''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) and the ''JSA All-Stars'' spin-off series, focuses on Magog as his own character. As such, Giffen gave Magog his own rogues gallery as well as explored Magog's origin, powers and relationships. The series was canceled with issue #12 because of low sales.\n\nThe first story arc revolves around Magog's origins and his fight against a mysterious weapons-development group called Flashpoint, run by the warden of Haven Prison (first introduced in the pages of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]''), D.P. Macklin. Magog meets his mother, a high-ranking woman called Alba, Firstborn of the Thirty-Three and Duchess of Blighted Albion, and his friend Axel, a former soldier who owns a gasoline station and auto repair shop who has created a souped-up search engine called Mirage, and teaches a young waitress named Lauren self-defense techniques after noticing that she is being beaten regularly by the man she lives with. Additionally, Magog meets and fights a once-rich, now-deformed homeless man known as Miasma, who was the leader of an underground city.<ref>''Magog'' #1\u20136 (November 2009\u2013April 2010). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen Magog attacks Haven's underground Flashpoint facilities, D.P. Macklin contacts the [[Justice Society of America]] and frames Magog for the ensuing prison break. After a lengthy skirmish with both prisoners and his fellow JSA members, Magog is officially kicked out of the All-Stars.<ref>''Justice Society of America Annual'' #2 (April 2010). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nIn recent events, Axel has surmised that David Reid may, in fact, be possessed by an extradimensional entity, which is the root of his powers. Magog is skeptical of such allegations and a visit with [[Zatanna]] has turned up no evidence to support Axel's theory thus far.<ref>''Magog'' #7 (May 2010). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the final issue, Magog faces his old friend Eric, who is now the cyborg warrior N.I.L.8., along with his group who are using Gog's technology to bring destruction.<ref>''Magog'' #12 (August 2010. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nMagog finds he has been controlled by the cult of Gog. When the Justice Society learn of Gog's technology, they arrive to save the planet. The JSA free Magog from the cult's control and he destroys N.I.L.8. Magog seemingly sacrifices himself when he finds the heart of Gog's technology and defeats it. He awakens in Albion with his enemy Kiera at his side. He refuses to be a pawn any longer and walks away.<ref>''Justice Society of America Special'' #1 (November 2010). DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===''Generation Lost''===\n{{Main|Justice League: Generation Lost}}\nFollowing the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', murderer and former [[Justice League International]] founder [[Maxwell Lord]] is returned to life and uses his psychic abilities to erase his existence from the memories of all but a handful of people. Lord then uses his powers to influence several high-ranking members of the military into believing [[Captain Atom]] should be apprehended for alleged wrongdoings. Magog is called in to restrain Atom in the event that he tries to flee, but ultimately fails as the hero defeats him and escapes.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #2 (June 2010).

Superman and Wonder Woman are now a romantic couple. They repel an invasion of parademons on Metropolis, but there are civilian casualties, including David Reid's mother (which he blames on them). Five years later, the two heroes are fighting two super-villains. A new hero, Wonderstar, a.k.a. David Reid who has amnesia, aids them. He seems to idolize Superman and Wonder Woman. Later in issue #14, Wonderstar's powers go out of control. Superman and Wonder Woman restrain him until a magic portal appears in the sky, dropping a golden staff weapon that looks like a two-pronged trident. Wonderstar touches it and becomes Magog. Circe the witch, Wonder Woman's archenemy, had cast spells to turn David Reid into Magog and make his wish come true (revenge on Superman and  Wonder Woman). In Superman/Wonder Woman #17, Circe's desire is for Diana to suffer and watch the death of Superman. Circe captures the couple and gloats, but when Wonder Woman outsmarts her, Circe retreats from Superman through a magic portal admitting defeat. Magog is defeated by Wonder Woman and deprived of his now-powerless staff, reverting him to a 10-year-old boy.\n\n==Collected editions==\n*''Magog: Lethal Force'' (Collects ''Magog'' #1\u20135)\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nReid possesses great amounts of plasma energy within him, which were originally focused into energy blasts by the device on his left arm. After his resurrection as Magog, his left arm is now metal and his energy blasts are focused through a staff given to him by Gog. He also possesses enhanced strength and endurance as the original Magog did. The staff was later upgraded by Max Lord to emit a form of radiation that harmed Captain Atom.<ref name=jlgl13 /> He is capable of flight, as well as teleportation of himself and others, though this last ability has not been seen since Gog's death. Keith Giffen, however, has stated that much of his power remains unexplored for the time being.

He first appeared in ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' #1 (May 1996), and was created by [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]]. In 2009, Magog was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 75th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/75.html Magog is number 75] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509075950/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/75.html |date=May 9, 2009 }} [[IGN]]. Retrieved 10-05-09.</ref> In ''Kingdom Come'', Magog's lack of conventional heroic qualities of idealism puts him at odds with Superman's morality.  After taking over Superman's place within the world's superhero community, his reckless actions with other would-be superheroes ultimately caused a nuclear disaster in the [[Midwestern United States]]; overwhelmed by guilt, he then realizes that Superman was right and seeks to atone for his crimes. In 2008, a parallel universe version of the character is introduced in DC Comics' main continuity; his destiny seemingly parallel to the original version's and some fear him due to their awareness of his counterpart's actions, yet granting him a benefit of doubt to prove himself as a true hero differing from his doppelg\u00e4nger.\n\n==Publication history==\n===Creation and development===\nMagog debuted in the first issue of the [[Elseworlds]] mini-series ''Kingdom Come'' in May 1996.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=190}}</ref> Within this possible future, he represents the violent, modern-style heroes who come into conflict with the classic, moralistic heroes of the past.\n\n''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' is a [[graphic novel]] rife with [[bible|biblical]] references. [[Gog and Magog]] are both biblical characters from the [[Book of Genesis]], the [[Book of Ezekiel]], and the [[Book of Revelation]] as well as names that appear in a variety of subsequent legends. In addition to taking his name from the [[Old Testament]], Magog represents the [[Golden calf]], that is, a [[idolatry#False idol|false idol]].{{deadlink|date=August 2013}}<ref name=keystothekingdom>[http://www.captionbox.net/keystokingdom/magog.html \"Keys to the Kingdom\" - Magog] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050110010727/http://www.captionbox.net/keystokingdom/magog.html |date=January 10, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nThe character's appearance was based on that of the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].<ref name=WizadXtra>Brick, Scott (March 2007). \"Alex Ross\".

[[Alex Ross]] stated, \"As I remember, Mark originally told me, 'Make him look like everything we hate in modern superhero design.'\"<ref name=keystothekingdom /> Ross has gone into more detail in an interview with [[Comic Book Resources]]:\n\n{{cquote|That's a character that Mark Waid invented that was really just put to me like come up with the most God awful, Rob Liefeld sort of design that you can.

His true origins are never revealed in the story. His most controversial act at the time was killing the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], who was in custody for the murder of [[Lois Lane]] and dozens of other members of the ''[[Daily Planet]]''.  Magog then surrenders to Superman and the authorities. When put on trial for murder, Magog is acquitted, the feeling being that it is time for psychotic super-villains like the Joker to be killed off rather than preserve the belief of heroes of Superman's generation that all life is sacred no matter what the crime or risk of [[recidivism]].\n\nSuperman publicly denounces Magog and the acquittal, prompting Magog to challenge him to a fight. Superman, disgusted with the verdict, refuses the challenge and instead goes into self-imposed exile. During the next ten years, a new generation of heroes following Magog's violent approach begins to arise. Magog himself begins operating with a team of heroes known as the Justice Battalion (a group composed of characters based on the heroes of [[Charlton Comics]], who also inspired Alan Moore's ''[[Watchmen]]''). During a one-sided and unnecessarily brutal battle with the villainous [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]], Magog's teammate [[Captain Atom]] is critically injured, causing him to explode with the force of an atomic bomb. This disaster leaves [[Kansas]] completely destroyed, over a million people killed, and much of America's heartland is covered in deadly radiation, destabilizing the American economy.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |page=232}}</ref>\n\nMagog and [[Metal Men|Alloy]] are the only survivors of the Kansas blast. This cataclysm is the event which finally draws Superman and many of the heroes of his generation out of retirement, thus leading to the story's inevitable generational conflict. Initially, Magog is considered the most wanted and dangerous criminal in the world and is hunted by Superman's new [[Justice League]]. They finally confront him as he tries with little success to put some small order back amongst the ruins of Kansas. Superman goads him with the remark \"You must be proud (of this destruction)\", which results in Magog lashing out at the Man of Steel, blaming him for the present crisis since he would not adapt to modern ways. After the attack fails to harm Superman, Magog quietly surrenders. It becomes apparent that he is traumatized by his experience and seeks forgiveness.\n\nHe is taken into custody by the League and held in their special prison where he and others are lectured about their violent ways, although Magog appears to spend most of his time remorsefully in his cell. However, the jail's walls are pierced by a brainwashed [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and in the battle that follows, Magog noticeably avoids fighting and just sticks to saving as many lives as he can. At the end of ''Kingdom Come'', Magog retires to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Paradise Island]], where he is seen caring for the crippled Japanese superheroine Tokyo Rose, and giving Swastika a hard clout when he fails to show proper respect to [[Wonder Woman]] and the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]]. In the [[Elliot S! Maggin]] novelization, it is revealed that Magog even becomes the Dean of Students at [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]].\n\n===''Justice Society of America''===\n[[Lance Corporal]] '''David Reid''', great-grandson of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], was with the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] platoon assigned to halt the looting of the National Museum of Iraq during the Iraq War. Reid tracked one of the looters and found an artifact that was a stone fragment of the Old God Gog. Upon touching it, Reid blacked out, waking up three weeks later to find that he was now filled with [[Plasma (physics)|plasma energy]] and that a mark shaped like the [[Eye of Providence]] had opened up on his left arm. With the aid of a pointed hand-held device (which earned him the nickname '''\"Lance\"'''), Reid was able to project focused blasts of energy.\n\nBecause the modern Justice Society of America tries to keep the legacies of former heroes alive, and because Franklin Roosevelt was credited with bringing the JSA together in the first place, the Society asked Reid to join them.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #12 (March 2008).

When Gog sets out to save a village from a rogue military attack, the JSA assist him. During the conflict, Lance is struck by an RPG missile and killed. Gog stands over Lance and brings him back to life, replacing his ruined left arm and right eye with gold metal. Gog then dubs Reid Magog.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #18 (September 2008).

Magog protects Gog until he sees him remove the gifts he gave to the Justice Society and use the corpses of [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mister Terrific]]'s wife and [[Alan Scott]]'s [[Jade (comics)|daughter]] to torture them. Magog then turns on Gog as well.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #21 (November 2008). DC Comics.</ref> Gog orders Magog to serve him or have his gift of life taken from him.

The series, while loosely tied into the events of ''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) and the ''JSA All-Stars'' spin-off series, focuses on Magog as his own character. As such, Giffen gave Magog his own rogues gallery as well as explored Magog's origin, powers and relationships. The series was canceled with issue #12 because of low sales.\n\nThe first story arc revolves around Magog's origins and his fight against a mysterious weapons-development group called Flashpoint, run by the warden of Haven Prison (first introduced in the pages of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]''), D.P. Macklin. Magog meets his mother, a high-ranking woman called Alba, Firstborn of the Thirty-Three and Duchess of Blighted Albion, and his friend Axel, a former soldier who owns a gasoline station and auto repair shop who has created a souped-up search engine called Mirage, and teaches a young waitress named Lauren self-defense techniques after noticing that she is being beaten regularly by the man she lives with. Additionally, Magog meets and fights a once-rich, now-deformed homeless man known as Miasma, who was the leader of an underground city.<ref>''Magog'' #1\u20136 (November 2009\u2013April 2010).

After a lengthy skirmish with both prisoners and his fellow JSA members, Magog is officially kicked out of the All-Stars.<ref>''Justice Society of America Annual'' #2 (April 2010). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nIn recent events, Axel has surmised that David Reid may, in fact, be possessed by an extradimensional entity, which is the root of his powers. Magog is skeptical of such allegations and a visit with [[Zatanna]] has turned up no evidence to support Axel's theory thus far.<ref>''Magog'' #7 (May 2010). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the final issue, Magog faces his old friend Eric, who is now the cyborg warrior N.I.L.8., along with his group who are using Gog's technology to bring destruction.<ref>''Magog'' #12 (August 2010. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nMagog finds he has been controlled by the cult of Gog. When the Justice Society learn of Gog's technology, they arrive to save the planet. The JSA free Magog from the cult's control and he destroys N.I.L.8. Magog seemingly sacrifices himself when he finds the heart of Gog's technology and defeats it.

Her charter is one of only eight known original manuscripts to survive from 7th century [[Francia]], among which it is the only private charter. It is a [[parchment]], which is unusual in that most surviving [[Merovingian]] documents of the 7th century were written on [[papyrus]]. As a result, it has been the object of detailed analysis over many years.\n\nClotilde, notes Levillain, was evidently a very important woman. It is supposed that she was in some way related to the Merovingian kings, but the exact relation is uncertain. Her name and its variants, male and female, are common ones among the Merovingians, perhaps due to the memory of [[Clotilde]] wife of [[Clovis I]]. Clovis and Clotilde had a daughter of the same name. This [[Clotilde (died 531)|Clotilde]] was unhappily married to the [[Visigoth]]ic king [[Amalaric|Amalric]]. King [[Guntram]] had a daughter named Clotilde, and [[Clotilde the Proud]], daughter of King [[Charibert I]], was a famously disobedient nun whose story is recounted by [[Gregory of Tours]]. Clotilde's charter also suggests a link to the Merovingians as it requires the nuns to pray for the stability of the kingdom and success for the king, a requirement found elsewhere only in royal charters.\n\nFrom the terms, derived from [[Roman law]], which Clotilde uses to describe the lands she is granting to the nunnery, it appears that these had belonged to her son who had died without heirs. The term ''Deo devota'' used to describe her is read as meaning that Clotilde herself will become a nun in her new foundation. The ''vir inluster'' Charicard who is to have a life interest in [[Fontenay-l\u00e8s-Briis]] is presumed to be Clotilde's husband for the legal terms used suggest that she was not a widow.\n\nThe charter was first published in 1681 by [[Jean Mabillon]] in his ''De Re diplomatica''. As the document long predates the general adoption of [[Anno Domini]] dating, there was initially a dispute over whether it belonged to the reign of King [[Chlothar II]] or King [[Chlothar III]]. Modern historians confidently date it to the sixteenth year of the reign of Chlothar III, from which the Anno Domini date of 673 is deduced. This dating had cast doubt on the authenticity of the charter as the reign of Chlothar III was presumed to have been only fifteen years prior to the 19th century.\n\nThe content of the charter is simple. Clotilde grants a number of properties to the [[Virgin Mary]] and to the nunnery which she is founding. The nunnery is to be led by her niece Mummola. Half of an additional estate at Fontenay-l\u00e8s-Briis is promised to the monastery after Clotilde and Charicard have both died. Clotilde sets out the rule that the nuns shall follow, based on that of [[Luxeuil]], and how Mummola's successors shall be elected. She calls down the wrath of the [[Holy Trinity]] on any who oppose the provisions of her charter.\n\nThe charter was issued at [[Lamorlaye]], a Merovingian palace north of [[Paris]]. The date and location suggest that Clotilde chose to have the charter witnessed on an occasion when important persons were at Lamorlaye for other reasons, perhaps the annual muster and review of warriors, rather than having convoked the meeting herself.\n\nEcclesiastical witnesses include the [[bishop of Paris]] [[Agilbert]], abbot Chrodecar, a lawyer named Rigobert. One Ermenric, who signs immediately after Agilbert, and is thus the chief layman present, is tentatively identified with the man of the same name who had been intendant of the royal domain under [[Clovis II]]. Two counts who witness, Vaning and Robert, had been close allies of the [[mayor of the palace]] [[Ebroin]]. The following witness is named [[Ghislemar]], probably the son of [[Waratton]], another mayor of the palace.\n\n==References==\n* {{citation|last=Rich\u00e9 |first=Pierre |title=Dictionnaire des Francs |volume=1: Les temps M\u00e9rovingiennes |isbn=2-84100-008-7 |page=106 |contribution=Clotilde |publisher=Bartillat |location=Paris |date=1996 }}\n* {{citation|last=Levillain |first=L\u00e9on |journal=Biblioth\u00e8que de l'\u00e9cole des chartes |year=1944 |volume=105 |title=\u00c9tudes m\u00e9rovingiennes : la charte de Clotilde (10 mars 673)  |pages=5&ndash;63 |url=http://www.persee.fr/showPage.do?urn=bec_0373-6237_1944_num_105_1_449321 |issn=0373-6237|doi=10.3406/bec.1944.449321 }}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Clotilde}}\n[[Category:7th-century Frankish women]]\n[[Category:7th-century Frankish nobility]]\n[[Category:7th-century Latin writers]]\n[[Category:7th-century women writers]]\n[[Category:7th-century Frankish writers]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:Charter of Clotilde.jpg|thumb|The charter of Clotilde founding the abbey of [[Bruy\u00e8res-le-Ch\u00e2tel]] dated 10 March 673.]]\n'''Clotilde''' or '''Chlodechilidis''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 673) was the founder of the abbey of [[Bruy\u00e8res-le-Ch\u00e2tel]].
