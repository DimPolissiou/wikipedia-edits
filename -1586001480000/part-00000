[[Gronings]]: {{lang|gos|Grunnen}}) is the main municipality as well as the capital city of the [[Groningen (province)|eponymous province]] in the [[Netherlands]]. It is the largest city in the north of the Netherlands and has 231,037 inhabitants (31 January 2019) on a total area of {{convert|180.21|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and land area of {{convert|168.93|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} with a population density of 1,367 per km<sup>2</sup> (3,540 per square mile). It merged with [[Ten Boer]] and [[Haren, Groningen|Haren]] municipalities in 1 January 2019. The [[Groningen-Assen metropolitan area]] has about half a million inhabitants. Groningen is an old city (more than 950 years) and was the regional power of the north of the Netherlands, a semi-independent city-state and member of the German [[Hanseatic League]]. Groningen is a university city, with an estimated 31,000 students at the [[University of Groningen]] (1 October 2018), and an estimated 28,000 at the [[Hanze University of Applied Sciences, Groningen|Hanze University of Applied Sciences]] (1 October 2018).\n\n==History==\nThe city was founded at the northernmost point of the ''[[Hondsrug]]'' area. The oldest document referring to Groningen's existence dates from 1040. However, the city already existed long before then: the oldest archaeological traces found are believed to stem from the years 3950\u20133720 BC, although the first major settlement in Groningen has been traced back to the 3rd century AD.\n\nIn the 13th century, when Groningen was an important trade centre, its inhabitants built a [[city wall]] to underline its authority. The city had a strong influence on the surrounding lands and made its [[dialect]] a common tongue. The most influential period of the city was the end of the 15th century, when the nearby province of [[Friesland]] was administered from Groningen. During these years, the ''[[Martinitoren]]'', then {{convert|127|m|abbr=off}} tall, was built; it loomed over the city. The city's independence ended in 1536, when it chose to accept [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], the Habsburg ruler of the other Netherlands, as its overlord.\n\n[[File:Groningen 1565.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Groningen in the 16th century]]\nIn 1594, Groningen, until then held by Spain, [[Siege of Groningen (1594)|was captured]] by a Dutch and English force led by [[Maurice of Nassau]]. Soon afterwards the city and the province joined the [[Dutch Republic|Republic of the Seven United Provinces]].\n\nIn 1614, the [[University of Groningen]] was founded, initially only for [[Theology#Theology as an academic discipline|religious education]]. In the same period the city expanded rapidly and a new city wall was built. That same city wall was tested during the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1672, when the city was [[Siege of Groningen|attacked fiercely]] by the bishop of [[Bishopric of M\u00fcnster|M\u00fcnster]], [[Bernhard von Galen]]. The city walls resisted, an event that is still celebrated with music and fireworks on 28 August (as \"''[[:nl:Gronings Ontzet|Gronings Ontzet]]''\" or \"''Bommen Berend''\").\n[[File:Groningen-7.jpg|alt=|thumb|280px|Der Aa Church and the Canal (2018)]]\nThe city did not escape the devastation of [[World War II]]. In particular, the main square, the Grote Markt, was largely destroyed in April 1945 in the [[Battle of Groningen]]. However, the ''Martinitoren'', its church, the ''[[Goudkantoor]]'', and the city hall were not damaged. The battle lasted several days.\n\n==Geography==\n===Climate===\nGroningen has an oceanic temperate climate, like all of the Netherlands, although slightly colder in winter than other major cities in the Netherlands due to its northeasterly position. Weather is influenced by the North Sea to the north-west and its prevailing north-western winds and gales.\n\nSummers are somewhat warm and humid. Temperatures of {{convert|30|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} or higher occur sporadically; the average daytime high is around {{convert|22|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Very rainy periods are common, especially in spring and summer. Average annual precipitation is about {{convert|800|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Annual sunshine hours vary, but are usually below 1600&nbsp;hours, giving much cloud cover similar to most of the Netherlands.  Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round.  The [[K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification]] subtype for this climate is \"[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification#GROUP C: Mild Temperate/mesothermal climates|Cfb]]\". (Marine West Coast Climate/[[Oceanic climate]]).<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=592559&cityname=Groningen%2C+Groningen%2C+Netherlands&units= Climate Summary for Groningen]</ref>\n\nWinters are cool: on average above freezing, although frosts are common during spells of easterly wind from Germany, Russia and even Siberia. Night-time temperatures of {{convert|-10|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} or lower are not uncommon during cold winter periods. The lowest temperature ever recorded is {{convert|-26.8|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}} on 16 February 1956. Snow often falls, but rarely stays long due to warmer daytime temperatures, although white snowy days happen every winter. \n{{Groningen weatherbox}}\n\n== Population growth ==\n[[File:Martini2.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Martinitoren|Martini Tower]]]]\n[[File:Eyecatcher (23907089).jpeg|thumb|280px|High Rise Office of ministry of Education]]\nThe municipality of Groningen has grown rapidly.

The [[Suiker Unie]] plant was originally outside Groningen, but it was completely swallowed by the expansion of the city. After a campaign to close the factory, it was finally shut down in 2008/2009. Before closing down, its sugar production amounted to 250,000 [[tonnes]] of [[beet sugar]], with 250 employees (2005 figures). The only remaining sugar factory is ''CSM Vierverlaten'' in [[Hoogkerk]], which produces 235,000&nbsp;tonnes of beet sugar, with 283 employees.\n\nWell known companies from Groningen are publishing company [[Noordhoff Uitgevers]], tobacco company [[Royal Theodorus Niemeyer]], health insurance company Menzis, distillery [[Hooghoudt distillery|Hooghoudt]], and natural gas companies GasUnie and [[GasTerra]]. There is an increased focus on business services; specifically IT, life sciences, tourism, energy, and environment.

A large network of bike paths makes it convenient to cycle to various destinations. In 2000, Groningen was chosen as ''[[Cycling in the Netherlands|Fietsstad 2002]]'' \u2014 top BikeCity of the Netherlands for 2002.\n\nThe city is very much adapted to the wishes of those who want to get around without a car, as it has an extensive network of segregated cycle-paths, good public transport, and a large pedestrianised zone in the city centre. The transformation of the historic centre into a pedestrian priority zone enables and invites walking and biking. This is achieved by applying the principle of [[Permeability (spatial and transport planning)|\"filtered permeability\"]]. It means that the network configuration favours [[active transportation]] and selectively \"filters out\" the car by reducing the number of streets that run through the centre. While certain streets are discontinuous for cars, they connect to a network of pedestrian and bike paths which permeate the entire centre. In addition, these paths go through public squares and open spaces, increasing the enjoyment of the trip (see image). The logic of filtering a mode of transport is fully expressed in a comprehensive model for laying out neighbourhoods and districts \u2013 the [[fused grid]].\n\n===Public transport===\n====Train's<ref>https://nieuws.ns.nl/spoorkaart-2020-hier-te-downloaden/</ref>====\n[[File:20080430_Hoofdstation_Groningen_NL.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Groningen_railway_station|Railway station ]] Groningen (2008)]]\nThe Station of [[Groningen railway station|Groningen]] or Hoofdstation as the locals call it, has regular services to most of the major cities in the Netherlands.

[[Gronings]]: {{lang|gos|Grunnen}}) is the main municipality as well as the capital city of the [[Groningen (province)|eponymous province]] in the [[Netherlands]]. It is the largest city in the north of the Netherlands and has 231,037 inhabitants (31 January 2019) on a total area of {{convert|180.21|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and land area of {{convert|168.93|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} with a population density of 1,367 per km<sup>2</sup> (3,540 per square mile). It merged with [[Ten Boer]] and [[Haren, Groningen|Haren]] municipalities in 1 January 2019. The [[Groningen-Assen metropolitan area]] has about half a million inhabitants. Groningen is an old city (more than 950 years) and was the regional power of the north of the Netherlands, a semi-independent city-state and member of the German [[Hanseatic League]]. Groningen is a university city, with an estimated 31,000 students at the [[University of Groningen]] (1 October 2018), and an estimated 28,000 at the [[Hanze University of Applied Sciences, Groningen|Hanze University of Applied Sciences]] (1 October 2018).\n\n==History==\nThe city was founded at the northernmost point of the ''[[Hondsrug]]'' area. The oldest document referring to Groningen's existence dates from 1040. However, the city already existed long before then: the oldest archaeological traces found are believed to stem from the years 3950\u20133720 BC, although the first major settlement in Groningen has been traced back to the 3rd century AD.\n\nIn the 13th century, when Groningen was an important trade centre, its inhabitants built a [[city wall]] to underline its authority. The city had a strong influence on the surrounding lands and made its [[dialect]] a common tongue. The most influential period of the city was the end of the 15th century, when the nearby province of [[Friesland]] was administered from Groningen. During these years, the ''[[Martinitoren]]'', then {{convert|127|m|abbr=off}} tall, was built; it loomed over the city. The city's independence ended in 1536, when it chose to accept [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], the Habsburg ruler of the other Netherlands, as its overlord.\n\n[[File:Groningen 1565.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Groningen in the 16th century]]\nIn 1594, Groningen, until then held by Spain, [[Siege of Groningen (1594)|was captured]] by a Dutch and English force led by [[Maurice of Nassau]]. Soon afterwards the city and the province joined the [[Dutch Republic|Republic of the Seven United Provinces]].\n\nIn 1614, the [[University of Groningen]] was founded, initially only for [[Theology#Theology as an academic discipline|religious education]]. In the same period the city expanded rapidly and a new city wall was built. That same city wall was tested during the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1672, when the city was [[Siege of Groningen|attacked fiercely]] by the bishop of [[Bishopric of M\u00fcnster|M\u00fcnster]], [[Bernhard von Galen]]. The city walls resisted, an event that is still celebrated with music and fireworks on 28 August (as \"''[[:nl:Gronings Ontzet|Gronings Ontzet]]''\" or \"''Bommen Berend''\").\n[[File:Groningen-7.jpg|alt=|thumb|280px|Der Aa Church and the Canal (2018)]]\nThe city did not escape the devastation of [[World War II]]. In particular, the main square, the Grote Markt, was largely destroyed in April 1945 in the [[Battle of Groningen]]. However, the ''Martinitoren'', its church, the ''[[Goudkantoor]]'', and the city hall were not damaged. The battle lasted several days.\n\n==Geography==\n===Climate===\nGroningen has an oceanic temperate climate, like all of the Netherlands, although slightly colder in winter than other major cities in the Netherlands due to its northeasterly position. Weather is influenced by the North Sea to the north-west and its prevailing north-western winds and gales.\n\nSummers are somewhat warm and humid. Temperatures of {{convert|30|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} or higher occur sporadically; the average daytime high is around {{convert|22|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Very rainy periods are common, especially in spring and summer. Average annual precipitation is about {{convert|800|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Annual sunshine hours vary, but are usually below 1600&nbsp;hours, giving much cloud cover similar to most of the Netherlands.  Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round.  The [[K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification]] subtype for this climate is \"[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification#GROUP C: Mild Temperate/mesothermal climates|Cfb]]\". (Marine West Coast Climate/[[Oceanic climate]]).<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=592559&cityname=Groningen%2C+Groningen%2C+Netherlands&units= Climate Summary for Groningen]</ref>\n\nWinters are cool: on average above freezing, although frosts are common during spells of easterly wind from Germany, Russia and even Siberia. Night-time temperatures of {{convert|-10|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} or lower are not uncommon during cold winter periods. The lowest temperature ever recorded is {{convert|-26.8|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}} on 16 February 1956. Snow often falls, but rarely stays long due to warmer daytime temperatures, although white snowy days happen every winter. \n{{Groningen weatherbox}}\n\n== Population growth ==\n[[File:Martini2.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Martinitoren|Martini Tower]]]]\n[[File:Eyecatcher (23907089).jpeg|thumb|280px|High Rise Office of ministry of Education]]\nThe municipality of Groningen has grown rapidly.

The [[Suiker Unie]] plant was originally outside Groningen, but it was completely swallowed by the expansion of the city. After a campaign to close the factory, it was finally shut down in 2008/2009. Before closing down, its sugar production amounted to 250,000 [[tonnes]] of [[beet sugar]], with 250 employees (2005 figures). The only remaining sugar factory is ''CSM Vierverlaten'' in [[Hoogkerk]], which produces 235,000&nbsp;tonnes of beet sugar, with 283 employees.\n\nWell known companies from Groningen are publishing company [[Noordhoff Uitgevers]], tobacco company [[Royal Theodorus Niemeyer]], health insurance company Menzis, distillery [[Hooghoudt distillery|Hooghoudt]], and natural gas companies GasUnie and [[GasTerra]]. There is an increased focus on business services; specifically IT, life sciences, tourism, energy, and environment.

Several caf\u00e9s feature live music, a few of which specialize in jazz music, including ''Jazzcafe De Spieghel'' on the Peperstraat. The jazz music students from the [[Prince Claus Conservatoire]] have been known to hold regular jam sessions in caf\u00e9s such as ''Peter Pan'' on the ''Voor Het Voormalige Klein Poortje'' and ''caf\u00e9 De Smederij'' on the Tuinstraat 2\u20134.

A large network of bike paths makes it convenient to cycle to various destinations. In 2000, Groningen was chosen as ''[[Cycling in the Netherlands|Fietsstad 2002]]'' \u2014 top BikeCity of the Netherlands for 2002.\n\nThe city is very much adapted to the wishes of those who want to get around without a car, as it has an extensive network of segregated cycle-paths, good public transport, and a large pedestrianised zone in the city centre. The transformation of the historic centre into a pedestrian priority zone enables and invites walking and biking. This is achieved by applying the principle of [[Permeability (spatial and transport planning)|\"filtered permeability\"]]. It means that the network configuration favours [[active transportation]] and selectively \"filters out\" the car by reducing the number of streets that run through the centre. While certain streets are discontinuous for cars, they connect to a network of pedestrian and bike paths which permeate the entire centre. In addition, these paths go through public squares and open spaces, increasing the enjoyment of the trip (see image). The logic of filtering a mode of transport is fully expressed in a comprehensive model for laying out neighbourhoods and districts \u2013 the [[fused grid]].\n\n===Public transport===\n====Train's<ref>https://nieuws.ns.nl/spoorkaart-2020-hier-te-downloaden/</ref>====\n[[File:20080430_Hoofdstation_Groningen_NL.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Groningen_railway_station|Railway station ]] Groningen (2008)]]\nThe Station of [[Groningen railway station|Groningen]] or Hoofdstation as the locals call it, has regular services to most of the major cities in the Netherlands.

The ruined house morphs into a lovely home in an [[Garden of Eden|edenic]] landscape. In bed, Mother, the poet's wife and muse, awakens and wonders aloud where Him is. While renovating the house, she starts seeing things that unsettle her, including visualizing a beating heart within its walls. One day, a stranger referred to as Man turns up at the house, asking for a room and claiming to be a local doctor. Him readily agrees, and Mother reluctantly follows suit. During his stay, Man suffers coughing fits and Mother observes an open wound in his side. Soon Man's wife, Woman, also arrives to stay. Mother is increasingly frustrated with her guests, but Him begs her to let them stay, revealing that Man is a fan whose dying wish was to meet Him. However, when Man and Woman accidentally shatter the crystal object, which Him had forbidden them to touch, Mother kicks them out and Him boards up his study. Before Man and Woman can leave, their two sons arrive and fight over their father's will. The oldest son, who will be left with nothing, severely wounds the younger brother and flees. Him, Man, and Woman take the injured son for help. Alone in the house, Mother follows a trail of blood to find a tank of heating oil hidden behind the basement walls.\n\nUpon returning, Him informs Mother the son has died. Dozens of people arrive at the house to honor the dead son. They behave in rude and presumptuous ways that irritate Mother; she snaps when they break a sink, partially flooding the house. She orders everyone out and berates Him for allowing so many people inside while ignoring her needs. Their argument ends in passionate lovemaking. The next morning, Mother announces she is pregnant. The news elates Him and inspires Him to finish his work. Mother prepares for the arrival of their child and reads Him's beautiful new poem. Upon publication, it immediately sells out every copy. In celebration, Mother prepares a big dinner, but a group of fans arrives at the house before they can eat. She asks Him to send them away, but he insists he has to be polite and show his appreciation, and tells her he will return soon. Mother tries to lock the doors, but more fans arrive and enter the house, where many begin to use the toilet. They start stealing things as souvenirs and damaging the house, but Him is oblivious due to the adulation he is receiving. Hundreds of people fill the house and an increasingly disoriented Mother watches it devolve into chaos. Military forces battle a cult of frenzied fans who tear rooms apart and engage in religious [[rituals]]. Amidst gunfire and explosions, the herald, the poet's publicist, organizes mass executions. Mother goes into labor and finds Him. He takes her to his study, which he reopens so she can give birth there.\n\nThe havoc outside subsides. Him tells Mother his fans want to see their newborn son; she refuses and holds her son tightly. When she falls asleep, however, Him takes their child outside to the crowd, which passes the baby around wildly until his neck is inadvertently snapped. Mother wades into the crowd where she sees people eating her son's mutilated corpse. Furious, she calls them murderers and stabs them with a shard of glass. They turn on her, viciously beating and attempting to strangle her until Him intervenes. He implores Mother to forgive them, but she escapes, makes her way to the basement oil tank, and punctures it with a pipe wrench. Despite her husband's pleas, she sets the oil alight; it explodes, destroying the crowd, the house, and the surrounding environment. Mother and Him survive; she is horrifically burned while Him is completely unscathed. He asks for her love and she agrees. He tears open her chest and removes her heart. As he crushes the heart with his hands, a new crystal object is revealed. He places it on its pedestal and, once again, the house is transformed from a burnt-out shell into a beautiful home. In bed, a new Mother appears and wakes up, wondering aloud where Him is.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|1=\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as mother\n* [[Javier Bardem]] as Him\n* [[Ed Harris]] as man\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as woman\n* [[Domhnall Gleeson]] as oldest son\n* [[Brian Gleeson (actor)|Brian Gleeson]] as younger brother\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as herald\n* [[Jovan Adepo]] as cupbearer\n* [[Stephen McHattie]] as zealot\n* [[Amanda Warren]] as healer\n* [[Laurence Leboeuf]] as maiden\n* [[Emily Hampshire]] as fool\n{{div col end}}\n}}\n\n==Themes==\n[[File:Upper Rhenish Master - The Garden of Eden (detail) - WGA23764.jpg|thumb|Detail from ''[[Paradiesg\u00e4rtlein]]'' (''Little Garden of Paradise''), by an unknown artist active {{Circa|1410\u201320}}, possibly in [[Strasbourg]].

The director discussed the film's unusual choice of not capitalising the letter 'm' in the title during a [[/r/IAmA|Reddit interview]], saying, \"To find out why there's a lowercase 'm', read the credits and look for the letter that isn't capitalised. Ask yourself what's another name for this character?\" The characters' names are all shown in lowercase, except for Him.<ref name=\"telegraph\" />\n\nThe lighter which appears throughout the film bears the [[Wendehorn]], a symbol believed to represent \"the cooperation between nature's eternal laws, working in effect and in accordance with each other.\" One of the film's unexplained elements is the yellow powder Lawrence's character drinks, which ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' suggests is a reference to [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]]'s short story \"[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]\".<ref name=\"telegraph\" />\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAfter 2014's ''[[Noah (2014 film)|Noah]]'', Aronofsky began working on a children's film.

The ruined house morphs into a lovely home in an [[Garden of Eden|edenic]] landscape. In bed, Mother, the poet's wife and muse, awakens and wonders aloud where Him is. While renovating the house, she starts seeing things that unsettle her, including visualizing a beating heart within its walls. One day, a stranger referred to as Man turns up at the house, asking for a room and claiming to be a local doctor. Him readily agrees, and Mother reluctantly follows suit. During his stay, Man suffers coughing fits and Mother observes an open wound in his side. Soon Man's wife, Woman, also arrives to stay. Mother is increasingly frustrated with her guests, but Him begs her to let them stay, revealing that Man is a fan whose dying wish was to meet Him. However, when Man and Woman accidentally shatter the crystal object, which Him had forbidden them to touch, Mother kicks them out and Him boards up his study. Before Man and Woman can leave, their two sons arrive and fight over their father's will. The oldest son, who will be left with nothing, severely wounds the younger brother and flees. Him, Man, and Woman take the injured son for help. Alone in the house, Mother follows a trail of blood to find a tank of heating oil hidden behind the basement walls.\n\nUpon returning, Him informs Mother the son has died. Dozens of people arrive at the house to honor the dead son. They behave in rude and presumptuous ways that irritate Mother; she snaps when they break a sink, partially flooding the house. She orders everyone out and berates Him for allowing so many people inside while ignoring her needs. Their argument ends in passionate lovemaking. The next morning, Mother announces she is pregnant. The news elates Him and inspires Him to finish his work. Mother prepares for the arrival of their child and reads Him's beautiful new poem. Upon publication, it immediately sells out every copy. In celebration, Mother prepares a big dinner, but a group of fans arrives at the house before they can eat. She asks Him to send them away, but he insists he has to be polite and show his appreciation, and tells her he will return soon. Mother tries to lock the doors, but more fans arrive and enter the house, where many begin to use the toilet. They start stealing things as souvenirs and damaging the house, but Him is oblivious due to the adulation he is receiving. Hundreds of people fill the house and an increasingly disoriented Mother watches it devolve into chaos. Military forces battle a cult of frenzied fans who tear rooms apart and engage in religious [[rituals]]. Amidst gunfire and explosions, the herald, the poet's publicist, organizes mass executions. Mother goes into labor and finds Him. He takes her to his study, which he reopens so she can give birth there.\n\nThe havoc outside subsides. Him tells Mother his fans want to see their newborn son; she refuses and holds her son tightly. When she falls asleep, however, Him takes their child outside to the crowd, which passes the baby around wildly until his neck is inadvertently snapped. Mother wades into the crowd where she sees people eating her son's mutilated corpse. Furious, she calls them murderers and stabs them with a shard of glass. They turn on her, viciously beating and attempting to strangle her until Him intervenes. He implores Mother to forgive them, but she escapes, makes her way to the basement oil tank, and punctures it with a pipe wrench. Despite her husband's pleas, she sets the oil alight; it explodes, destroying the crowd, the house, and the surrounding environment. Mother and Him survive; she is horrifically burned while Him is completely unscathed. He asks for her love and she agrees. He tears open her chest and removes her heart. As he crushes the heart with his hands, a new crystal object is revealed. He places it on its pedestal and, once again, the house is transformed from a burnt-out shell into a beautiful home. In bed, a new Mother appears and wakes up, wondering aloud where Him is.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|1=\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as mother\n* [[Javier Bardem]] as Him\n* [[Ed Harris]] as man\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as woman\n* [[Domhnall Gleeson]] as oldest son\n* [[Brian Gleeson (actor)|Brian Gleeson]] as younger brother\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as herald\n* [[Jovan Adepo]] as cupbearer\n* [[Stephen McHattie]] as zealot\n* [[Amanda Warren]] as healer\n* [[Laurence Leboeuf]] as maiden\n* [[Emily Hampshire]] as fool\n{{div col end}}\n}}\n\n==Themes==\n[[File:Upper Rhenish Master - The Garden of Eden (detail) - WGA23764.jpg|thumb|Detail from ''[[Paradiesg\u00e4rtlein]]'' (''Little Garden of Paradise''), by an unknown artist active {{Circa|1410\u201320}}, possibly in [[Strasbourg]].
