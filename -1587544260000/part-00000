''[[The New York Times]]'' felt that the decision was based on the shortage of well-known talent and the absence of women's events in the sport.<ref name=\"wp-dropped\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/wrestling-ioc-make-right-moves-in-getting-sport-back-on-2020-olympics-program/2013/09/08/a2ed9cc4-18a2-11e3-8685-5021e0c41964_story.html|title=Wrestling, IOC make right moves in getting sport back on 2020 Olympics program|last=Hamilton|first=Tracee|date=8 September 2013|work=Washington Post|access-date=16 March 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621143725/https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/wrestling-ioc-make-right-moves-in-getting-sport-back-on-2020-olympics-program/2013/09/08/a2ed9cc4-18a2-11e3-8685-5021e0c41964_story.html|archive-date=21 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/13/sports/olympics-may-drop-wrestling-in-2020.html|title=Olympics Moves to Drop Wrestling in 2020|last=Longman|first=Jer\u00e9|date=12 February 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=16 March 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621150844/https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/13/sports/olympics-may-drop-wrestling-in-2020.html|archive-date=21 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=bbc-nowrestling>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/21427455|title=Wrestling to be dropped from 2020 Olympic Games|work=BBC Sport|date=12 February 2013 |access-date=26 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701064236/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/21427455|archive-date=1 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Wrestling was duly added to the shortlist of applicants for inclusion in the 2020 Games, alongside the seven new sports that were put forward for consideration.<ref name=\"wp-dropped\" />\n\nOn 29 May 2013, it was announced that three of the eight sports under consideration had made the final shortlist: [[baseball]]/[[softball]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]] and [[wrestling]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/baseball-softball-squash-and-wrestling-make-cut-for-ioc-session-vote-in-buenos-aires/199833 |title=Baseball/softball, squash and wrestling make cut for IOC Session vote in Buenos Aires |date=29 May 2013 |website=Olympic.org |publisher=[[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607170846/https://www.olympic.org/news/baseball-softball-squash-and-wrestling-make-cut-for-ioc-session-vote-in-buenos-aires/199833 |archive-date=7 June 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The other five sports were rejected at this point: [[karate]], [[roller sport]]s, [[sport climbing]], [[wakeboarding]], and [[wushu (sport)|wushu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/notes_and_insights/wrestling_baseball_softball_and_squash_shortlisted_by_ioc_for_2020_as_five|title=Wrestling, baseball/softball and squash shortlisted by IOC for 2020 as five fail to make cut|access-date=12 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924124611/http://www.sportspromedia.com/notes_and_insights/wrestling_baseball_softball_and_squash_shortlisted_by_ioc_for_2020_as_five|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> On 8&nbsp;September 2013, at the [[125th IOC Session]], wrestling was chosen to be included in the Olympic program for 2020 and [[2024 Summer Olympics|2024]].<!--but as a non-\"core\" sport this time--> Wrestling secured 49 votes, while baseball/softball and squash received 24 votes and 22 votes respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/wrestling-added-to-olympic-program-for-2020-and-2024-games/208839|title=Wrestling added to Olympic program for 2020 and 2024 Games|publisher=[[IOC]]|date=8 September 2013|access-date=8 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911122207/http://www.olympic.org/news/wrestling-added-to-olympic-program-for-2020-and-2024-games/208839|archive-date=11 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nUnder new IOC policies that shift the Games to use an \"event-based\" program rather than a \"sport-based\" program, the host organizing committee can now also propose the addition of sports to the program.

Many people used the Pony Express as a communication link. It also encouraged catalogues to be created, allowing people to buy goods and have them brought by horse to the customers.{{sfnp|Bradley|1913|pp=25\u201329}} It became the West's most direct means of east\u2013west communication before the [[First transcontinental telegraph|transcontinental telegraph]] was established (October 24, 1861), and was vital for tying the new U.S. state of California with the rest of the [[United States]].\n\nDespite a heavy subsidy, the Pony Express was not a financial success and went bankrupt in eighteen months, when faster telegraph service was established.  Nevertheless, it demonstrated that a unified transcontinental system of communications could be established and operated year-round. When replaced by the telegraph, the Pony Express quickly became romanticized and became part of the lore of the [[American Old West|American West]]. Its reliance on the ability and endurance of individual young, hardy riders and fast horses was seen as evidence of rugged American individualism of the [[Frontier Thesis|Frontier]] times.\n\n==Inception and founding==\n[[File:Alexander Majors Pony Express.jpg|thumb|upright|Alexander Majors]]\n\nThe idea of a fast mail route to the Pacific coast was prompted largely by California's newfound prominence and its rapidly growing population. After [[California gold rush|gold was discovered there in 1848]], thousands of [[prospectors]], investors and businessmen made their way to California, at that time a new territory of the U.S. By 1850, California entered the Union as a free state. By 1860, the population had grown to 380,000.{{sfnp|Bradley|1913|p=9}} The demand for a faster way to get the mail and other communications to and from this westernmost state became even greater as the [[American Civil War]] approached.\n\n[[William Hepburn Russell|William Russell]], [[Alexander Majors]], and [[William B. Waddell (Pony Express founder)|William B. Waddell]] were the three founders of the Pony Express. They were already in the freighting and [[drayage]] business. At the peak of the operations, they employed 6,000 men, owned 75,000 oxen, thousands of wagons and warehouses, plus a sawmill, a meatpacking plant, a bank and an insurance company.{{sfn|Peters|1996|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\nRussell was a prominent businessman, well respected among his peers and the community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Hepburn-Russell|title=William Hepburn Russell {{!}} American businessman|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref> Waddell was co-owner of the firm Morehead, Waddell & Co. After Morehead was bought out and retired, Waddell merged his company with Russell's, changing the name to Waddell & Russell. In 1855, they took on a new partner, Alexander Majors, and founded the company of Russell, Majors & Waddell.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|pp=4\u20135}} They held government contracts for delivering army supplies to the western frontier, and Russell had a similar idea for contracts with the U.S. Government for fast mail delivery.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932|p=76}}\n\nBy utilizing a short route and using mounted riders rather than traditional [[stagecoach]]es, they proposed to establish a fast mail service between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California, with letters delivered in 10 days, a duration many said was impossible. The initial price was set at $5 per {{convert|1/2|oz|g}}, then $2.50, and by July 1861 to $1. The founders of the Pony Express hoped to win an exclusive government mail contract, but that did not come about.\n\nRussell, Majors, and Waddell organized and put together the Pony Express in two months in the winter of 1860. The undertaking assembled 120 riders, 184 stations, 400 horses, and several hundred personnel during January and February 1861.<ref name=\"museum\">\n{{cite web\n|title=Pony Express National Museum\n|url=http://www.ci.st-joseph.mo.us/history/ponyexpress.cfm\n|publisher=City of St Joseph\n|accessdate=December 10, 2012\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312171306/http://www.ci.st-joseph.mo.us/history/ponyexpress.cfm\n|archivedate=March 12, 2013\n|df=mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nMajors was a religious man and resolved \"by the help of God\" to overcome all difficulties.

They often said that, if it came to be, the horse and rider should perish before the mochila did. The mochila was thrown over the saddle and held in place by the weight of the rider sitting on it. Each corner had a ''cantina,'' or pocket. Bundles of mail were placed in these cantinas, which were padlocked for safety. The mochila could hold {{convert|20|lb|0}} of mail along with the {{convert|20|lb|0}} of material carried on the horse.<ref>Riders were issued a Bible, a horn to alert employees at stations of their approach, a rifle, two Colt revolvers and ammunition for self-defense.

Riders, who could not weigh over {{convert|125|lb}}, changed about every {{convert|75|\u2013|100|mi|sigfig=2}}, and rode day and night. In emergencies, a given rider might ride two stages back to back, over 20 hours on a quickly moving horse.\n\nIt is unknown if riders tried crossing the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in winter, but they certainly crossed central Nevada. By 1860 there was a telegraph station in [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]], [[Nevada Territory]]. The riders received $100 a month as pay. A comparable wage for unskilled labor at the time was about $0.43\u2013$1 per day.\n\nAlexander Majors, one of the founders of the Pony Express, had acquired more than 400 horses for the project.

Through Nebraska it followed the [[Great Platte River Road]], cutting through [[Gothenburg, Nebraska]], clipping the edge of Colorado at [[Julesburg, Colorado]], and passing [[Courthouse Rock]], [[Chimney Rock National Historic Site|Chimney Rock]], and [[Scotts Bluff National Monument|Scotts Bluff]], before arriving at [[Fort Laramie]] in Wyoming. From there it followed the [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]], passing [[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]], [[Devil's Gate (Wyoming)|Devil's Gate]], and [[Split Rock (Wyoming)|Split Rock]], to [[Fort Caspar]], through [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] to [[Fort Bridger]] and then down to Salt Lake City. From Salt Lake City it generally followed the [[Central Nevada Route]] blazed by Captain [[James H. Simpson]] of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers#History|Corps of Topographical Engineers]] in 1859. This route roughly follows today's [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] across Nevada and Utah. It crossed the [[Great Basin]], the [[Central Nevada Route|Utah-Nevada Desert]], and the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] near [[Lake Tahoe]] before arriving in [[Sacramento]]. Mail was then sent via steamer down the [[Sacramento River]] to [[San Francisco]]. On a few instances when the steamer was missed, riders took the mail via horseback to [[Oakland, California]].\n\n===Stations===\nThere were 190 stations along the long and arduous route used by the Pony Express. The stations and station keepers were essential to the successful, timely and smooth operation of the Pony Express mail system. The stations were often fashioned out of existing structures, several of them located in military forts, while others were built anew in remote areas where living conditions were very basic.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=113}} The route was divided up into five divisions.{{sfnp|Godfrey|1994}} To maintain the rigid schedule, 157 relay stations were located from {{convert|5|to|25|mi|0}} apart as the terrain would allow for. At each ''swing station,'' riders would exchange their tired mounts for fresh ones, while \"home stations\" provided room and board for the riders between runs. This technique allowed the mail to be whisked across the continent in record time. Each rider rode about {{convert|75|mi|sigfig=2}} per day.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=162}}\n<!-- No contemporary linking, please.

Prior to the election, Russell hired extra riders to ensure that fresh riders and relay horses were available along the route. On November 7, 1860, a Pony Express rider departed [[Fort Kearny]], Nebraska Territory (the end of the eastern telegraph line) with the election results. Riders sped along the route, over snow-covered trails and into Fort Churchill, Nevada Territory (the end of the western telegraph line). California's newspapers received word of Lincoln's election only seven days and 17 hours after the East Coast papers, an \"unrivaled feat at the time\".<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2a5a2_ponyexpress.html \n |title=Pony Express: ''Romance'' versus ''Reality'' \n |publisher=[[National Postal Museum]] \n |accessdate=December 10, 2012 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021120155/https://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2a5a2_ponyexpress.html \n |archivedate=October 21, 2012 \n}}</ref>\n\n==Attacks==\n[[File:Pony Express Stolen Mail 1860.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Stolen Pony Express mail.

It took place from May through June 1860, though sporadic violence continued for a period afterward.\nIn the brief history of the Pony Express, it only happened once that the mail did not go through. After completing eight weekly trips from both Sacramento and Saint Joseph, the Pony Express was forced to suspend mail services because of the outbreak of the Paiute Indian War in May 1860.\n\nApproximately 6,000 Paiutes in Nevada had suffered during a winter of fierce blizzards that year. By spring, the whole tribe was ready to embark on a war, except for the Paiute chief named [[Numaga]]. For three days Numaga fasted and argued for peace.{{sfnp|Angel|1881|p=151}}\nMeanwhile, a raiding party attacked Williams Station, a Pony Express station located on the [[Carson River]] near present-day [[Lake Lahontan]]. One account says the raid was a deliberate attempt to provoke war. Another says the raiders had heard that men at the station had kidnapped two Paiute women, and fighting broke out when they went to investigate and free the women. Either way, the war party killed five men and the station was burned.{{sfnp|Michno|2007|p=89-90}}\n\nDuring the following weeks, other isolated incidents occurred when whites in the Paiute country were ambushed and killed. The Pony Express was a special target. Seven other express stations were also attacked; 16 employees were killed, and approximately 150 express horses were either stolen or driven off. The Paiute war cost the Pony Express company about $75,000 in livestock and station equipment, not to mention the loss of life. In June of that year, the Paiute uprising had been ended through the intervention of U.S. government troops, after which four delayed mail shipments from the East were finally brought to San Francisco on June 25, 1860,.{{sfnp|Frajola|Kramer|Walske|2005|p=18}}\n\nDuring this brief war, one Pony Express mailing, which left San Francisco on July 21, 1860, did not immediately reach its destination. That mail pouch (mochila) did not reach St. Joseph and subsequently New York until almost two years later.\n\n==Famous riders==\nIn 1860, riding for the Pony Express was difficult work&nbsp;\u2013 riders had to be tough and lightweight. A famous advertisement allegedly read:\n\n<blockquote>Wanted: Young, skinny, wiry fellows not over eighteen. Must be expert riders, willing to risk death daily. Orphans preferred{{efn|One historian, Joseph Nardone, claims that the \"orphans preferred\" ad is a hoax (dating no earlier than 1902), as no one has found the ad in contemporary newspaper archives.{{sfnp|Thompson|2005}}}}</blockquote>\n\nThe Pony Express had an estimated 80 riders traveling east or west along the route at any given time. In addition, there were also about 400 other employees, including station keepers, stock tenders and route superintendents. Many young men applied; Waddell and Majors could have easily hired riders at low rates, but instead offered one hundred dollars a month{{snd}}a handsome sum for that time.{{sfnp|Reinfeld|1973|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PSAOQ83qZ2cC&pg=PA49 49]}} Author [[Mark Twain]] described the riders in his travel memoir ''[[Roughing It]]'' as: \"...&nbsp;usually a little bit of a man\". Though the riders were small, lightweight, generally teenage boys, they came to be seen as heroes of the American West.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=162}} There was no systematic list of riders kept by the company,{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|pp=73\u201374}} but a partial list has been compiled by Raymond and Nancy Settle in their ''Saddles & Spurs'' (1972).{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|pp=74\u201376}}\n\n{{For|the list of Pony Express riders|Category:Pony Express riders}}\n\n===First riders===\n[[File:Riders Pony Express.jpg|thumb|\"Billy\" Richardson, Johnny Fry, Charles Cliff, Gus Cliff]]\n\nThe identity of the first westbound rider to depart St. Joseph has been disputed, but currently most historians have narrowed it down to either [[Johnny Fry]] or [[Johnson William Richardson|Billy Richardson]].{{sfnp|Root|Hickman|1946|loc=Note 358}}<ref name=\"NPSStables\" />{{sfnp|Godfrey|1994|loc=[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/poex/hrs/hrs2e.htm Chap 2 p. 5]}}<ref name=\"museum\" /> Both Expressmen were hired at St. Joseph for A.

At the conclusion of all the speeches, approximately 7:15&nbsp;pm, Russell turned the mail pouch over to the first rider. A cannon fired, the large assembled crowd cheered, and the rider dashed to the landing at the foot of Jules Street where the ferry boat ''Denver'', under a full head of steam, alerted by the signal cannon, waited to carry the horse and rider across the Missouri River to Elwood, Kansas Territory.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1955|p=58}}{{sfnp|Bradley|1913|p= 31}} On April 9 at 6:45&nbsp;pm, the first rider from the east reached Salt Lake City, Utah.

At the age of 15, Cody was on his way west to California when he met Pony Express agents along the way and signed on with the company. Cody helped in the construction of several way-stations. Thereafter, he was employed as a rider and was given a short {{convert|45|mi|adj=on}} delivery run from the township of Julesburg which lay to the west. After some months he was transferred to Slade's Division in Wyoming where he made the longest non-stop ride from Red Buttes Station to Rocky Ridge Station and back when he found that his relief rider had been killed. The distance of {{convert|322|mi}} over one of the most dangerous sections of the entire trail was completed in 21 hours and 40 minutes, and 21 horses were required to complete this section.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=162}}  On one occasion when carrying mail he unintentionally ran into an Indian war party but managed to escape.

Haslam was hired by Bolivar Roberts, helped build the stations, and was given the mail run from Friday's Station at Lake Tahoe to Buckland's Station near Fort Churchill, {{convert|75|mi}} to the east.\n\nHis greatest ride, {{convert|120|mi}} in 8 hours and 20 minutes while wounded, was an important contribution to the fastest trip ever made by the Pony Express. The mail carried Lincoln's inaugural address. Indian problems in 1860 led to Pony Bob Haslam's record-breaking ride. He had received the eastbound mail (probably the May 10 mail from San Francisco) at Friday's Station. When he reached Buckland's Station his relief rider was so badly frightened over the Indian threat that he refused to take the mail. Haslam agreed to take the mail all the way to Smith's Creek for a total distance of {{convert|190|mi}} without a rest. After a rest of nine hours, he retraced his route with the westbound mail where, at Cold Springs, he found that Indians had raided the place, killing the station keeper and running off all of the stock.

The horses were ridden quickly between stations, an average distance of {{convert|15|mi}}, and then were relieved and a fresh horse would be exchanged for the one that just arrived from its strenuous run.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nDuring his route of {{convert|80|to|100|mi}}, a Pony Express rider would change horses 8 to 10 times. The horses were ridden at a fast trot, canter or gallop, around {{convert|10|to|15|mph}} and at times they were driven to full gallop at speeds up to {{convert|25|mph}}. Horses of the Pony Express were purchased in Missouri, Iowa, California, and some western U.S. territories.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe various types of horse ridden by riders of the Pony Express included [[Morgan_horse|Morgans]] and thoroughbreds which were often used on the eastern end of the trail. [[Mustangs]] were often used on the western (more rugged) end of the mail route.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last=Stong\n|first=Phil\n|title=Horses and Americans\n|url=https://archive.org/details/horsesamericans00ston\n|url-access=registration\n|publisher=Frederick A.

His business expanded as the town grew, and when the Pony Express came to town Landis was the ideal candidate to produce saddles for the newly founded Pony Express. Because Pony Express riders rode their horses at a quick pace over a distance of {{convert|10|mi}} or more between stations, every consideration was made to reduce the overall weight the horse had to carry. To help reduce this load, special lightweight [[saddle]]s were designed and crafted. Using less leather and fewer metallic and wood components, they fashioned a saddle that was similar in design to the regular stock saddle generally in use in the West at that time.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932}}\n\nThe mail pouch was a separate component to the saddle that made the Pony Express unique. Standard mail pouches for horses were never employed because of their size and shape, as it was time-consuming detaching and attaching it from one saddle to the other, causing undue delay in changing mounts. With many stops to make, the delayed time at each station would accumulate to appreciable proportions. To get around this difficulty, a ''mochila'' (a covering of leather) was thrown over the saddle. The saddle horn and cantle projected through holes which were specially cut to size in the mochila. Attached to the broad leather skirt of the mochila were four cantinas, or box-shaped hard leather compartments, where letters were carried on the journey.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932}}\n\n==Closing==\nDuring its brief time in operation, the Pony Express delivered approximately 35,000 letters between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California.<ref>{{ cite web |title=Replica of a Pony Express mochila |publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |accessdate=July 21, 2014 |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=2&cmd=1&id=17889&img=1&pg=1}}</ref> Although the Pony Express proved that the central/northern mail route was viable, [[Russell, Majors and Waddell]] did not get the contract to deliver mail over the route. The contract was instead awarded to [[Jeremy Dehut]] in March 1861, who had taken over the southern Congressionally favored [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] Stage Line. The so-called 'Stagecoach King', [[Ben Holladay]], acquired the Russell, Majors and Waddell stations for his stagecoaches.\n\nShortly after the contract was awarded, the start of the [[American Civil War]] caused the stage line to cease operation. From March 1861, the Pony Express ran mail only between Salt Lake City and Sacramento. The Pony Express announced its closure on October 26, 1861, two days after the [[First Transcontinental Telegraph|transcontinental telegraph]] reached Salt Lake City and connected [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and [[Sacramento, California]].<!--<h Museum]</ref>--> Other telegraph lines connected points along the line and other cities on the east and west coasts.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|title=The First Transcontinental Telegraph System Was Completed October 24, 1861\n|work=AmericasLibrary.gov: America's Story from America's Library\n|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]\n|url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/civil/jb_civil_telegrap_1.html\n|accessdate=September 14, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nDespite the subsidy, the Pony Express was a financial failure.

Until the 1950s most of what was known about the short-lived Pony Express was the product of a few accounts, hearsay and folklore, generally true in their overall aspects, but lacking in verification in many areas for those who wanted to explore the history surrounding the founders, the various riders and station keepers or who were interested in stations or Forts along the Pony Express route.\n\nThe most complete books on the Pony Express are ''The Story of the Pony Express'' and ''Saddles and Spurs'' by Raymond & Mary Settle and Roy Bloss. Settle's account is unique as he was the first writer and historical researcher to make use of Pony Express founder William B. Waddell's papers, now in a collection at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. Mr. Settle wrote in the mid-1950s. Mr. Bloss was a writer for the Pony Express Centennial. While Settle's work was published generally without his annotations and notes, the writer's background here is unique and Settle does have an excellent bibliography. When Settle prepared to publish his well-researched account he had a good volume of footnotes, citations prepared, but the editors chose not to use most of them. Instead, they opted for a less expensive approach to print and publish and released an accurate, but simplified account. Settle was not pleased with this new and sudden development, as he put much time and effort into the annotations. Yet, the account Settle wrote was and is a definitive one and is considered the best account on the history of the Pony Express amongst many historians.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.anb.org/articles/20/20-01914.html |title=Russell, William Hepburn |encyclopedia=American National Biography |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=December 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{main|Pony Express National Historic Trail}}\n[[File:Pony-express-statue.jpg|thumb|Pony Express statue in St. Joseph, Missouri]]\nFrom 1866 until 1889, the Pony Express logo was used by stagecoach and freight company [[Wells Fargo]], which provided secure mail service.

Many people used the Pony Express as a communication link. It also encouraged catalogues to be created, allowing people to buy goods and have them brought by horse to the customers.{{sfnp|Bradley|1913|pp=25\u201329}} It became the West's most direct means of east\u2013west communication before the [[First transcontinental telegraph|transcontinental telegraph]] was established (October 24, 1861), and was vital for tying the new U.S. state of California with the rest of the [[United States]].\n\nDespite a heavy subsidy, the Pony Express was not a financial success and went bankrupt in eighteen months, when faster telegraph service was established.  Nevertheless, it demonstrated that a unified transcontinental system of communications could be established and operated year-round. When replaced by the telegraph, the Pony Express quickly became romanticized and became part of the lore of the [[American Old West|American West]]. Its reliance on the ability and endurance of individual young, hardy riders and fast horses was seen as evidence of rugged American individualism of the [[Frontier Thesis|Frontier]] times.\n\n==Inception and founding==\n[[File:Alexander Majors Pony Express.jpg|thumb|upright|Alexander Majors]]\n\nThe idea of a fast mail route to the Pacific coast was prompted largely by California's newfound prominence and its rapidly growing population. After [[California gold rush|gold was discovered there in 1848]], thousands of [[prospectors]], investors and businessmen made their way to California, at that time a new territory of the U.S. By 1850, California entered the Union as a free state. By 1860, the population had grown to 380,000.{{sfnp|Bradley|1913|p=9}} The demand for a faster way to get the mail and other communications to and from this westernmost state became even greater as the [[American Civil War]] approached.\n\n[[William Hepburn Russell|William Russell]], [[Alexander Majors]], and [[William B. Waddell (Pony Express founder)|William B. Waddell]] were the three founders of the Pony Express. They were already in the freighting and [[drayage]] business. At the peak of the operations, they employed 6,000 men, owned 75,000 oxen, thousands of wagons and warehouses, plus a sawmill, a meatpacking plant, a bank and an insurance company.{{sfn|Peters|1996|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\nRussell was a prominent businessman, well respected among his peers and the community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Hepburn-Russell|title=William Hepburn Russell {{!}} American businessman|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref> Waddell was co-owner of the firm Morehead, Waddell & Co. After Morehead was bought out and retired, Waddell merged his company with Russell's, changing the name to Waddell & Russell. In 1855, they took on a new partner, Alexander Majors, and founded the company of Russell, Majors & Waddell.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|pp=4\u20135}} They held government contracts for delivering army supplies to the western frontier, and Russell had a similar idea for contracts with the U.S. Government for fast mail delivery.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932|p=76}}\n\nBy utilizing a short route and using mounted riders rather than traditional [[stagecoach]]es, they proposed to establish a fast mail service between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California, with letters delivered in 10 days, a duration many said was impossible. The initial price was set at $5 per {{convert|1/2|oz|g}}, then $2.50, and by July 1861 to $1. The founders of the Pony Express hoped to win an exclusive government mail contract, but that did not come about.\n\nRussell, Majors, and Waddell organized and put together the Pony Express in two months in the winter of 1860. The undertaking assembled 120 riders, 184 stations, 400 horses, and several hundred personnel during January and February 1861.<ref name=\"museum\">\n{{cite web\n|title=Pony Express National Museum\n|url=http://www.ci.st-joseph.mo.us/history/ponyexpress.cfm\n|publisher=City of St Joseph\n|accessdate=December 10, 2012\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312171306/http://www.ci.st-joseph.mo.us/history/ponyexpress.cfm\n|archivedate=March 12, 2013\n|df=mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nMajors was a religious man and resolved \"by the help of God\" to overcome all difficulties.

They often said that, if it came to be, the horse and rider should perish before the mochila did. The mochila was thrown over the saddle and held in place by the weight of the rider sitting on it. Each corner had a ''cantina,'' or pocket. Bundles of mail were placed in these cantinas, which were padlocked for safety. The mochila could hold {{convert|20|lb|0}} of mail along with the {{convert|20|lb|0}} of material carried on the horse.<ref>Riders were issued a Bible, a horn to alert employees at stations of their approach, a rifle, two Colt revolvers and ammunition for self-defense.

Riders, who could not weigh over {{convert|125|lb}}, changed about every {{convert|75|\u2013|100|mi|sigfig=2}}, and rode day and night. In emergencies, a given rider might ride two stages back to back, over 20 hours on a quickly moving horse.\n\nIt is unknown if riders tried crossing the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in winter, but they certainly crossed central Nevada. By 1860 there was a telegraph station in [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]], [[Nevada Territory]]. The riders received $100 a month as pay. A comparable wage for unskilled labor at the time was about $0.43\u2013$1 per day.\n\nAlexander Majors, one of the founders of the Pony Express, had acquired more than 400 horses for the project.

Through Nebraska it followed the [[Great Platte River Road]], cutting through [[Gothenburg, Nebraska]], clipping the edge of Colorado at [[Julesburg, Colorado]], and passing [[Courthouse Rock]], [[Chimney Rock National Historic Site|Chimney Rock]], and [[Scotts Bluff National Monument|Scotts Bluff]], before arriving at [[Fort Laramie]] in Wyoming. From there it followed the [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]], passing [[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]], [[Devil's Gate (Wyoming)|Devil's Gate]], and [[Split Rock (Wyoming)|Split Rock]], to [[Fort Caspar]], through [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] to [[Fort Bridger]] and then down to Salt Lake City. From Salt Lake City it generally followed the [[Central Nevada Route]] blazed by Captain [[James H. Simpson]] of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers#History|Corps of Topographical Engineers]] in 1859. This route roughly follows today's [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] across Nevada and Utah. It crossed the [[Great Basin]], the [[Central Nevada Route|Utah-Nevada Desert]], and the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] near [[Lake Tahoe]] before arriving in [[Sacramento]]. Mail was then sent via steamer down the [[Sacramento River]] to [[San Francisco]]. On a few instances when the steamer was missed, riders took the mail via horseback to [[Oakland, California]].\n\n===Stations===\nThere were 190 stations along the long and arduous route used by the Pony Express. The stations and station keepers were essential to the successful, timely and smooth operation of the Pony Express mail system. The stations were often fashioned out of existing structures, several of them located in military forts, while others were built anew in remote areas where living conditions were very basic.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=113}} The route was divided up into five divisions.{{sfnp|Godfrey|1994}} To maintain the rigid schedule, 157 relay stations were located from {{convert|5|to|25|mi|0}} apart as the terrain would allow for. At each ''swing station,'' riders would exchange their tired mounts for fresh ones, while \"home stations\" provided room and board for the riders between runs. This technique allowed the mail to be whisked across the continent in record time. Each rider rode about {{convert|75|mi|sigfig=2}} per day.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=162}}\n<!-- No contemporary linking, please.

Prior to the election, Russell hired extra riders to ensure that fresh riders and relay horses were available along the route. On November 7, 1860, a Pony Express rider departed [[Fort Kearny]], Nebraska Territory (the end of the eastern telegraph line) with the election results. Riders sped along the route, over snow-covered trails and into Fort Churchill, Nevada Territory (the end of the western telegraph line). California's newspapers received word of Lincoln's election only seven days and 17 hours after the East Coast papers, an \"unrivaled feat at the time\".<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2a5a2_ponyexpress.html \n |title=Pony Express: ''Romance'' versus ''Reality'' \n |publisher=[[National Postal Museum]] \n |accessdate=December 10, 2012 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021120155/https://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2a5a2_ponyexpress.html \n |archivedate=October 21, 2012 \n}}</ref>\n\n==Attacks==\n[[File:Pony Express Stolen Mail 1860.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Stolen Pony Express mail.

It took place from May through June 1860, though sporadic violence continued for a period afterward.\nIn the brief history of the Pony Express, it only happened once that the mail did not go through. After completing eight weekly trips from both Sacramento and Saint Joseph, the Pony Express was forced to suspend mail services because of the outbreak of the Paiute Indian War in May 1860.\n\nApproximately 6,000 Paiutes in Nevada had suffered during a winter of fierce blizzards that year. By spring, the whole tribe was ready to embark on a war, except for the Paiute chief named [[Numaga]]. For three days Numaga fasted and argued for peace.{{sfnp|Angel|1881|p=151}}\nMeanwhile, a raiding party attacked Williams Station, a Pony Express station located on the [[Carson River]] near present-day [[Lake Lahontan]]. One account says the raid was a deliberate attempt to provoke war. Another says the raiders had heard that men at the station had kidnapped two Paiute women, and fighting broke out when they went to investigate and free the women. Either way, the war party killed five men and the station was burned.{{sfnp|Michno|2007|p=89-90}}\n\nDuring the following weeks, other isolated incidents occurred when whites in the Paiute country were ambushed and killed. The Pony Express was a special target. Seven other express stations were also attacked; 16 employees were killed, and approximately 150 express horses were either stolen or driven off. The Paiute war cost the Pony Express company about $75,000 in livestock and station equipment, not to mention the loss of life. In June of that year, the Paiute uprising had been ended through the intervention of U.S. government troops, after which four delayed mail shipments from the East were finally brought to San Francisco on June 25, 1860,.{{sfnp|Frajola|Kramer|Walske|2005|p=18}}\n\nDuring this brief war, one Pony Express mailing, which left San Francisco on July 21, 1860, did not immediately reach its destination. That mail pouch (mochila) did not reach St. Joseph and subsequently New York until almost two years later.\n\n==Famous riders==\nIn 1860, riding for the Pony Express was difficult work&nbsp;\u2013 riders had to be tough and lightweight. A famous advertisement allegedly read:\n\n<blockquote>Wanted: Young, skinny, wiry fellows not over eighteen. Must be expert riders, willing to risk death daily. Orphans preferred{{efn|One historian, Joseph Nardone, claims that the \"orphans preferred\" ad is a hoax (dating no earlier than 1902), as no one has found the ad in contemporary newspaper archives.{{sfnp|Thompson|2005}}}}</blockquote>\n\nThe Pony Express had an estimated 80 riders traveling east or west along the route at any given time. In addition, there were also about 400 other employees, including station keepers, stock tenders and route superintendents. Many young men applied; Waddell and Majors could have easily hired riders at low rates, but instead offered one hundred dollars a month{{snd}}a handsome sum for that time.{{sfnp|Reinfeld|1973|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PSAOQ83qZ2cC&pg=PA49 49]}} Author [[Mark Twain]] described the riders in his travel memoir ''[[Roughing It]]'' as: \"...&nbsp;usually a little bit of a man\". Though the riders were small, lightweight, generally teenage boys, they came to be seen as heroes of the American West.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=162}} There was no systematic list of riders kept by the company,{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|pp=73\u201374}} but a partial list has been compiled by Raymond and Nancy Settle in their ''Saddles & Spurs'' (1972).{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|pp=74\u201376}}\n\n{{For|the list of Pony Express riders|Category:Pony Express riders}}\n\n===First riders===\n[[File:Riders Pony Express.jpg|thumb|\"Billy\" Richardson, Johnny Fry, Charles Cliff, Gus Cliff]]\n\nThe identity of the first westbound rider to depart St. Joseph has been disputed, but currently most historians have narrowed it down to either [[Johnny Fry]] or [[Johnson William Richardson|Billy Richardson]].{{sfnp|Root|Hickman|1946|loc=Note 358}}<ref name=\"NPSStables\" />{{sfnp|Godfrey|1994|loc=[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/poex/hrs/hrs2e.htm Chap 2 p. 5]}}<ref name=\"museum\" /> Both Expressmen were hired at St. Joseph for A.

At the conclusion of all the speeches, approximately 7:15&nbsp;pm, Russell turned the mail pouch over to the first rider. A cannon fired, the large assembled crowd cheered, and the rider dashed to the landing at the foot of Jules Street where the ferry boat ''Denver'', under a full head of steam, alerted by the signal cannon, waited to carry the horse and rider across the Missouri River to Elwood, Kansas Territory.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1955|p=58}}{{sfnp|Bradley|1913|p= 31}} On April 9 at 6:45&nbsp;pm, the first rider from the east reached Salt Lake City, Utah.

At the age of 15, Cody was on his way west to California when he met Pony Express agents along the way and signed on with the company. Cody helped in the construction of several way-stations. Thereafter, he was employed as a rider and was given a short {{convert|45|mi|adj=on}} delivery run from the township of Julesburg which lay to the west. After some months he was transferred to Slade's Division in Wyoming where he made the longest non-stop ride from Red Buttes Station to Rocky Ridge Station and back when he found that his relief rider had been killed. The distance of {{convert|322|mi}} over one of the most dangerous sections of the entire trail was completed in 21 hours and 40 minutes, and 21 horses were required to complete this section.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=162}}  On one occasion when carrying mail he unintentionally ran into an Indian war party but managed to escape. Cody was present for many significant chapters in early western history, including the gold rush, the building of the railroads and cattle herding on the Great Plains.

Haslam was hired by Bolivar Roberts, helped build the stations, and was given the mail run from Friday's Station at Lake Tahoe to Buckland's Station near Fort Churchill, {{convert|75|mi}} to the east.\n\nHis greatest ride, {{convert|120|mi}} in 8 hours and 20 minutes while wounded, was an important contribution to the fastest trip ever made by the Pony Express. The mail carried Lincoln's inaugural address. Indian problems in 1860 led to Pony Bob Haslam's record-breaking ride. He had received the eastbound mail (probably the May 10 mail from San Francisco) at Friday's Station. When he reached Buckland's Station his relief rider was so badly frightened over the Indian threat that he refused to take the mail. Haslam agreed to take the mail all the way to Smith's Creek for a total distance of {{convert|190|mi}} without a rest. After a rest of nine hours, he retraced his route with the westbound mail where, at Cold Springs, he found that Indians had raided the place, killing the station keeper and running off all of the stock.

During the Paiute uprising of 1860 he was chased by a band of Paiute Indians on horseback and was forced to retreat into the hills behind some big rocks where he killed seven of his assailants in a shoot-out before being killed himself. His body was found riddled with arrows but was not scalped, a sign that the Paiutes honored their enemy.{{sfnp|McNesse|2009|p=105}}\n\n==Horses==\n[[File:Pony express crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Frank E.

Horses of the Pony Express were purchased in Missouri, Iowa, California, and some western U.S. territories.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe various types of horse ridden by riders of the Pony Express included [[Morgan_horse|Morgans]] and thoroughbreds which were often used on the eastern end of the trail.

His business expanded as the town grew, and when the Pony Express came to town Landis was the ideal candidate to produce saddles for the newly founded Pony Express. Because Pony Express riders rode their horses at a quick pace over a distance of {{convert|10|mi}} or more between stations, every consideration was made to reduce the overall weight the horse had to carry. To help reduce this load, special lightweight [[saddle]]s were designed and crafted. Using less leather and fewer metallic and wood components, they fashioned a saddle that was similar in design to the regular stock saddle generally in use in the West at that time.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932}}\n\nThe mail pouch was a separate component to the saddle that made the Pony Express unique. Standard mail pouches for horses were never employed because of their size and shape, as it was time-consuming detaching and attaching it from one saddle to the other, causing undue delay in changing mounts. With many stops to make, the delayed time at each station would accumulate to appreciable proportions. To get around this difficulty, a ''mochila'' (a covering of leather) was thrown over the saddle. The saddle horn and cantle projected through holes which were specially cut to size in the mochila. Attached to the broad leather skirt of the mochila were four cantinas, or box-shaped hard leather compartments, where letters were carried on the journey.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932}}\n\n==Closing==\nDuring its brief time in operation, the Pony Express delivered approximately 35,000 letters between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California.<ref>{{ cite web |title=Replica of a Pony Express mochila |publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |accessdate=July 21, 2014 |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=2&cmd=1&id=17889&img=1&pg=1}}</ref> Although the Pony Express proved that the central/northern mail route was viable, [[Russell, Majors and Waddell]] did not get the contract to deliver mail over the route. The contract was instead awarded to [[Jeremy Dehut]] in March 1861, who had taken over the southern Congressionally favored [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] Stage Line. The so-called 'Stagecoach King', [[Ben Holladay]], acquired the Russell, Majors and Waddell stations for his stagecoaches.\n\nShortly after the contract was awarded, the start of the [[American Civil War]] caused the stage line to cease operation. From March 1861, the Pony Express ran mail only between Salt Lake City and Sacramento. The Pony Express announced its closure on October 26, 1861, two days after the [[First Transcontinental Telegraph|transcontinental telegraph]] reached Salt Lake City and connected [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and [[Sacramento, California]].<!--<h Museum]</ref>--> Other telegraph lines connected points along the line and other cities on the east and west coasts.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|title=The First Transcontinental Telegraph System Was Completed October 24, 1861\n|work=AmericasLibrary.gov: America's Story from America's Library\n|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]\n|url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/civil/jb_civil_telegrap_1.html\n|accessdate=September 14, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nDespite the subsidy, the Pony Express was a financial failure.

Until the 1950s most of what was known about the short-lived Pony Express was the product of a few accounts, hearsay and folklore, generally true in their overall aspects, but lacking in verification in many areas for those who wanted to explore the history surrounding the founders, the various riders and station keepers or who were interested in stations or Forts along the Pony Express route.\n\nThe most complete books on the Pony Express are ''The Story of the Pony Express'' and ''Saddles and Spurs'' by Raymond & Mary Settle and Roy Bloss. Settle's account is unique as he was the first writer and historical researcher to make use of Pony Express founder William B. Waddell's papers, now in a collection at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. Mr. Settle wrote in the mid-1950s. Mr. Bloss was a writer for the Pony Express Centennial. While Settle's work was published generally without his annotations and notes, the writer's background here is unique and Settle does have an excellent bibliography. When Settle prepared to publish his well-researched account he had a good volume of footnotes, citations prepared, but the editors chose not to use most of them. Instead, they opted for a less expensive approach to print and publish and released an accurate, but simplified account. Settle was not pleased with this new and sudden development, as he put much time and effort into the annotations. Yet, the account Settle wrote was and is a definitive one and is considered the best account on the history of the Pony Express amongst many historians.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.anb.org/articles/20/20-01914.html |title=Russell, William Hepburn |encyclopedia=American National Biography |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=December 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{main|Pony Express National Historic Trail}}\n[[File:Pony-express-statue.jpg|thumb|Pony Express statue in St. Joseph, Missouri]]\nFrom 1866 until 1889, the Pony Express logo was used by stagecoach and freight company [[Wells Fargo]], which provided secure mail service.

Wright's breakthrough album, ''[[The Dream Weaver]]'' (1975), came after he had spent seven years in London as, alternately, a member of the British [[hard rock|heavy rock]] band [[Spooky Tooth]] and a solo artist on [[A&M Records]]. While in England, he played keyboards on former [[The Beatles|Beatle]] [[George Harrison]]'s triple album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' (1970), so beginning a friendship that inspired the [[Indian religions|Indian]] religious themes and spirituality inherent in Wright's subsequent songwriting. His work since the late 1980s has embraced [[world music]] and the [[New-age music|new age]] genre, although none of his post-1976 releases has matched the popularity of ''The Dream Weaver''.\n\nA former child actor, Wright performed on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the hit musical ''[[Fanny (musical)|Fanny]]'' before studying medicine and then psychology in New York and Berlin. After meeting [[Chris Blackwell]] of [[Island Records]] in Europe, Wright moved to London, where he helped establish Spooky Tooth as a popular live act. He also served as the band's principal songwriter on their recordings \u2013 among them, the well-regarded albums ''[[Spooky Two]]'' (1969) and ''[[You Broke My Heart So I Busted Your Jaw]]'' (1973). His solo album ''[[Footprint (album)|Footprint]]'' (1971), recorded with contributions from Harrison, coincided with the formation of Wright's short-lived band Wonderwheel, which included guitarist [[Mick Jones (Foreigner)|Mick Jones]]. Also during the early 1970s, Wright played on notable recordings by [[B.B. King]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Harry Nilsson]] ,[[Johnny Hallyday]] and [[Ronnie Spector]], while his musical association with Harrison endured until shortly before the latter's death in 2001.\n\nWright turned to [[film soundtrack]] work in the early 1980s, which led to him re-recording his most popular song, \"Dream Weaver\", for the 1992 comedy ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]''. Following Spooky Tooth's reunion tour in 2004, Wright has performed live frequently, either as a member of Starr's [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band|All-Starr Band]], with his own live band, or on subsequent Spooky Tooth reunions. Wright's most recent solo albums, including ''Waiting to Catch the Light'' (2008) and ''Connected'' (2010), have all been issued on his Larklio record label. In 2014, [[TarcherPerigee|Jeremy P. Tarcher]] published his autobiography, titled ''Dream Weaver: Music, Meditation, and My Friendship with George Harrison''.\n\n==Early life==\nGary Wright was born and raised in [[Cresskill, New

Wright's breakthrough album, ''[[The Dream Weaver]]'' (1975), came after he had spent seven years in London as, alternately, a member of the British [[hard rock|heavy rock]] band [[Spooky Tooth]] and a solo artist on [[A&M Records]]. While in England, he played keyboards on former [[The Beatles|Beatle]] [[George Harrison]]'s triple album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' (1970), so beginning a friendship that inspired the [[Indian religions|Indian]] religious themes and spirituality inherent in Wright's subsequent songwriting. His work since the late 1980s has embraced [[world music]] and the [[New-age music|new age]] genre, although none of his post-1976 releases has matched the popularity of ''The Dream Weaver''.\n\nA former child actor, Wright performed on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the hit musical ''[[Fanny (musical)|Fanny]]'' before studying medicine and then psychology in New York and Berlin. After meeting [[Chris Blackwell]] of [[Island Records]] in Europe, Wright moved to London, where he helped establish Spooky Tooth as a popular live act. He also served as the band's principal songwriter on their recordings \u2013 among them, the well-regarded albums ''[[Spooky Two]]'' (1969) and ''[[You Broke My Heart So I Busted Your Jaw]]'' (1973). His solo album ''[[Footprint (album)|Footprint]]'' (1971), recorded with contributions from Harrison, coincided with the formation of Wright's short-lived band Wonderwheel, which included guitarist [[Mick Jones (Foreigner)|Mick Jones]]. Also during the early 1970s, Wright played on notable recordings by [[B.B. King]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Harry Nilsson]] and [[Ronnie Spector]], while his musical association with Harrison endured until shortly before the latter's death in 2001.\n\nWright turned to [[film soundtrack]] work in the early 1980s, which led to him re-recording his most popular song, \"Dream Weaver\", for the 1992 comedy ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]''. Following Spooky Tooth's reunion tour in 2004, Wright has performed live frequently, either as a member of Starr's [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band|All-Starr Band]], with his own live band, or on subsequent Spooky Tooth reunions. Wright's most recent solo albums, including ''Waiting to Catch the Light'' (2008) and ''Connected'' (2010), have all been issued on his Larklio record label. In 2014, [[TarcherPerigee|Jeremy P. Tarcher]] published his autobiography, titled ''Dream Weaver: Music, Meditation, and My Friendship with George Harrison''.\n\n==Early life==\nGary Wright was born and raised in [[Cresskill, New

{"title_page": "Heat (professional wrestling)", "text_new": "{{about|a [[professional wrestling]] term|the [[WWE]] program|WWE Heat}}\n{{short description|Professional wrestling term}}\nIn [[professional wrestling]], '''heat''' can refer to both crowd reactions and real-life animosity between those involved in a professional wrestling [[angle (professional wrestling)|angle]], or match.\n\nIn terms of crowd reaction, heat is usually used to denote how much of a reaction a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel wrestler]] receives, but can also be used for a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]]. Although the term can in some contexts refer to either positive or negative crowd reactions, heat is usually used specifically to mean a negative crowd response (booing etc.), with its opposite being a \"[[Pop (professional wrestling)|pop]]\" or positive reaction (cheering, clapping, etc.).\n\nAs heat typically refers to a negative reaction that a wrestling character gets from a crowd in a performance setting, it has also become slang for a negative reaction that a wrestler gets backstage from colleagues, management or both. Backstage heat can be garnered for both real and perceived slights and transgressions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cagesideseats.com/2011/8/5/2346505/wwe-diva-melina-talks-about-being-the-most-controversial-woman-in|title=WWE Diva Melina Talks About Being The \"Most Controversial Woman in Wrestling,\" Starts Podcast|author=S.

The villains can also draw cheap heat by referring to a mainstream news event as part of their [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|promo]], especially if the event has strongly emotional or political ramifications (e.g. a natural disaster), although they sometimes do not mention it by name. Historically, another common practice of villains to draw cheap heat involves using [[Racial slurs|racial and ethnic slurs]] to offend the collective sensibility of wrestling fans. For example, in 1972, when the [[American Indian Movement]] was gaining momentum, [[Baron von Raschke]] was known to refer to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[WWA World Heavyweight Championship (Indianapolis version)|WWA World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Billy Red Cloud]] as a \"dirty low down [[List of ethnic slurs#I|Injun]]\" as a means of drawing cheap heat.\n\nAnother example of a wrestler using cheap heat was [[Sgt. Slaughter]], who often delivered anti-American promos during the [[Gulf War]] (and [[Gulf War#Operation Desert Shield|Operation Desert Shield]] immediately before it) as part of his [[Iraq]]i sympathizer [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]]; one of those promos came at the [[Survivor Series (1990)|1990 Survivor Series]], where Slaughter insulted servicemen stationed in Iraq for [[Thanksgiving]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2006/09/13/1837794.html|title=Sgt.

Pre-taped crowd reactions from other events are also spliced in with the programming to make the crowd look more energetic than it actually is, or if [[Professional wrestling promoter|promoters]] want a storyline to go in a particular direction.\n\nFor example, in early 1992 the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] was attempting to [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] [[Sid Eudy|Sid Justice]] as a villain. During the [[Royal Rumble (1992)|Royal Rumble]] match in January,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/19881152//mainevent/|title=Ric Flair (spot No. 3) wins the Royal Rumble Match to become new WWE Champion|date=January 19, 1992|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=April 13, 2008}}</ref> Justice \u2013 who had become popular due to his charisma \u2013 was loudly cheered when he eliminated [[Hulk Hogan]], and commentators [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan]] and [[Gorilla Monsoon]] picked up on this as a fair act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/92.htm|title=Royal Rumble 1992|publisher=The History of the WWE|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}</ref> However, the reaction was edited in future television replays, with Sid being booed heavily and Monsoon describing him as a \"jerk.\"\n\nBefore ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'' went live in 2016,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/wwe-smackdown-live-usa-1201782569/|title=WWE's 'Smackdown' Will Move To Live Broadcast On USA (EXCLUSIVE)|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 25, 2016|accessdate=May 25, 2016}}</ref> WWE usually overdubbed cheers on it and professional wrestling magazine ''[[Power Slam]]'' joked that the company has had to \"fire up the Fake Crowd Roar Machine\u2122 to add an artificial atmosphere\".<ref>\"What's Going Down...\", ''[[Power Slam]]'', issue 222, March 2013, p.5.</ref> This was particularly done for [[Roman Reigns]], who was heavily booed at the time despite being booked as a babyface.\n\n== Go Home Heat ==\n\"Go home heat\" (sometimes called \"go away heat\" or \"nuclear heat\") occurs when fans boo or jeer a legitimately disliked character or, sometimes, the wrestler playing that character. Go home heat can be given to wrestlers who are viewed negatively, either for their [[Booking (professional wrestling)|booking]], their character, or even their actions outside of the show; thus, both heroes and villains can get this kind of heat. However, nuclear heat can also mean a heel character getting genuine disdain from fans, simply from great character work. This is much less common in the present day, as fans may be more clued in to the inner workings of professional wrestling, and this type of heat is transformed into a pop. This is due to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#smark|smarks]] realizing how good the character work is, and cheering instead of booing.\n\nGenerally speaking,  go home heat happens either because the fans feel the promotion has been too aggressively [[Push (professional wrestling)|pushing]] a certain wrestler (regardless of his character alignment) who they feel is undeserving of their push, or because the character has become stale, boring, and uninteresting. While it can be difficult to distinguish the good heat for the villain from go away heat, with some fans and critics claiming it is indeed go away heat and others claiming it is good heat, there are a few example which are closer to be go away heat, most notably in WWE because of its major exposure. Notorious examples of the concept are The Rock as Rocky Maivia, [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]] (who popularized the term in the early 2000s so much that go away heat is also known as \"[[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#X|X-Pac heat]]\"), [[Triple H]], John Bradshaw Layfield, Stephanie McMahon, and more recently [[Roman Reigns]] (see [[Persona and reception of Roman Reigns]]) and [[Baron Corbin]].\n\n=== Rocky Maivia ===\nBetween 1996 and 1997, Rocky Maivia was the first major example of go away heat and also the best example of turning the go away heat into a star by 1998.<ref name=\"The Rock\">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/rock.html|title=The Rock|publisher=SLAM Sports!|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}</ref> Hyped as the WWF's first third-generation wrestler,<ref>{{cite episode|title= Marc Mero, Rocky Maivia, Jake Roberts, and The Stalker vs. Crush, Jerry Lawler, Hunter Hearst Helmsley, and Goldust|series=[[Survivor Series (1996)]]|credits=World Wrestling Federation|airdate=1996-11-17}}</ref> Maivia was a clean-cut heroic character who was pushed heavily from the start and won the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] despite his wrestling inexperience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1997/raw021397 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026201823/http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1997%2Fraw021397 |archivedate=October 26, 2006 |title=WWF Thursday RAW: February 13, 1997 |publisher=The Other Arena |accessdate=March 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322532 |title=Rocky Maivia's first Intercontinental Championship reign |publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]] |accessdate=March 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410102450/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322532 |archivedate=April 10, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref> This was during a transitional, but more edgy period that would lead to the [[Attitude Era]], therefore audiences became increasingly hostile toward Maivia, with chants of \"Die, Rocky, die!\" and \"Rocky sucks!\" being heard during his matches.<ref name=\"The Rock\"/> After suffering a  [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legit]] injury in April 1997, Maivia would return as a villain character in August 1997 by joining the [[Nation of Domination]] and refusing to acknowledge the Rocky Maivia name, instead referring to himself in the third person as The Rock, insulting the audience in his promos as well as WWF television interviewers.<ref name=\"The Rock\"/> The Rock would eventually become the Nation's leader and draw good heat, then starting getting cheered while still being a villain before being officially turned back into a fan favorite character by September 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/breakdown98.html|title=In Your House 24: Breakdown 1998 results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=March 19, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514225942/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/breakdown98.html|archive-date=May 14, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/judgementday98.html|title=In Your House 25: Judgment Day 1998 results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=March 19, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128011334/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/judgementday98.html|archive-date=January 28, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> During his time in the Nation, The Rock would get back the Intercontinental Championship and held it for 265 days (the second longest in the 1990s and the longest ever since),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1997/raw120897 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026202130/http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1997%2Fraw120897 |archivedate=October 26, 2006 |title=WWF RAW: December 8, 1997 |publisher=The Other Arena |accessdate=March 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322552 |title=The Rock's second Intercontinental Championship reign |publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]] |accessdate=March 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428234605/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322552 |archivedate=April 28, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref> with his second reign being better reviewed and the [[ladder match]] in which he lost the title to Triple H at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]] being rated ****1/4 out of [[Dave Meltzer#Impact|five stars]] by journalist [[Dave Meltzer]] of ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'' (''WON'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr=2034|title=WWF SummerSlam 1998 -

Although the term can in some contexts refer to either positive or negative crowd reactions, heat is usually used specifically to mean a negative crowd response (booing etc.), with its opposite being a \"[[Pop (professional wrestling)|pop]]\" or positive reaction (cheering, clapping, etc.).\n\nAs heat typically refers to a negative reaction that a wrestling character gets from a crowd in a performance setting, it has also become slang for a negative reaction that a wrestler gets backstage from colleagues, management or both. Backstage heat can be garnered for both real and perceived slights and transgressions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cagesideseats.com/2011/8/5/2346505/wwe-diva-melina-talks-about-being-the-most-controversial-woman-in|title=WWE Diva Melina Talks About Being The \"Most Controversial Woman in Wrestling,\" Starts Podcast|author=S.

The villains can also draw cheap heat by referring to a mainstream news event as part of their [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|promo]], especially if the event has strongly emotional or political ramifications (e.g. a natural disaster), although they sometimes do not mention it by name. Historically, another common practice of villains to draw cheap heat involves using [[Racial slurs|racial and ethnic slurs]] to offend the collective sensibility of wrestling fans. For example, in 1972, when the [[American Indian Movement]] was gaining momentum, [[Baron von Raschke]] was known to refer to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[WWA World Heavyweight Championship (Indianapolis version)|WWA World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Billy Red Cloud]] as a \"dirty low down [[List of ethnic slurs#I|Injun]]\" as a means of drawing cheap heat.\n\nAnother example of a wrestler using cheap heat was [[Sgt. Slaughter]], who often delivered anti-American promos during the [[Gulf War]] (and [[Gulf War#Operation Desert Shield|Operation Desert Shield]] immediately before it) as part of his [[Iraq]]i sympathizer [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]]; one of those promos came at the [[Survivor Series (1990)|1990 Survivor Series]], where Slaughter insulted servicemen stationed in Iraq for [[Thanksgiving]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2006/09/13/1837794.html|title=Sgt.

Pre-taped crowd reactions from other events are also spliced in with the programming to make the crowd look more energetic than it actually is, or if [[Professional wrestling promoter|promoters]] want a storyline to go in a particular direction.\n\nFor example, in early 1992 the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] was attempting to [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] [[Sid Eudy|Sid Justice]] as a villain. During the [[Royal Rumble (1992)|Royal Rumble]] match in January,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/19881152//mainevent/|title=Ric Flair (spot No. 3) wins the Royal Rumble Match to become new WWE Champion|date=January 19, 1992|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=April 13, 2008}}</ref> Justice \u2013 who had become popular due to his charisma \u2013 was loudly cheered when he eliminated [[Hulk Hogan]], and commentators [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan]] and [[Gorilla Monsoon]] picked up on this as a fair act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/92.htm|title=Royal Rumble 1992|publisher=The History of the WWE|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}</ref> However, the reaction was edited in future television replays, with Sid being booed heavily and Monsoon describing him as a \"jerk.\"\n\nBefore ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'' went live in 2016,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/wwe-smackdown-live-usa-1201782569/|title=WWE's 'Smackdown' Will Move To Live Broadcast On USA (EXCLUSIVE)|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 25, 2016|accessdate=May 25, 2016}}</ref> WWE usually overdubbed cheers on it and professional wrestling magazine ''[[Power Slam]]'' joked that the company has had to \"fire up the Fake Crowd Roar Machine\u2122 to add an artificial atmosphere\".<ref>\"What's Going Down...\", ''[[Power Slam]]'', issue 222, March 2013, p.5.</ref> This was particularly done for [[Roman Reigns]], who was heavily booed at the time despite being booked as a babyface.\n\n== Go Home Heat ==\n\"Go home heat\" (sometimes called \"go away heat\" or \"nuclear heat\") occurs when fans boo or jeer a legitimately disliked character or, sometimes, the wrestler playing that character. Go home heat can be given to wrestlers who are viewed negatively, either for their [[Booking (professional wrestling)|booking]], their character, or even their actions outside of the show; thus, both heroes and villains can get this kind of heat. However, nuclear heat can also mean a heel character getting genuine disdain from fans, simply from great character work. This is much less common in the present day, as fans may be more clued in to the inner workings of professional wrestling, and this type of heat is transformed into a pop. This is due to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#smark|smarks]] realizing how good the character work is, and cheering instead of booing.\n\nGenerally speaking,  go home heat happens either because the fans feel the promotion has been too aggressively [[Push (professional wrestling)|pushing]] a certain wrestler (regardless of his character alignment) who they feel is undeserving of their push, or because the character has become stale, boring, and uninteresting. While it can be difficult to distinguish the good heat for the villain from go away heat, with some fans and critics claiming it is indeed go away heat and others claiming it is good heat, there are a few example which are closer to be go away heat, most notably in WWE because of its major exposure. Notorious examples of the concept are The Rock as Rocky Maivia, [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]] (who popularized the term in the early 2000s so much that go away heat is also known as \"[[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#X|X-Pac heat]]\"), [[Triple H]], John Bradshaw Layfield, Stephanie McMahon, and more recently [[Roman Reigns]] (see [[Persona and reception of Roman Reigns]]) and [[Baron Corbin]].\n\n=== Rocky Maivia ===\nBetween 1996 and 1997, Rocky Maivia was the first major example of go away heat and also the best example of turning the go away heat into a star by 1998.<ref name=\"The Rock\">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/rock.html|title=The Rock|publisher=SLAM Sports!|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}</ref> Hyped as the WWF's first third-generation wrestler,<ref>{{cite episode|title= Marc Mero, Rocky Maivia, Jake Roberts, and The Stalker vs. Crush, Jerry Lawler, Hunter Hearst Helmsley, and Goldust|series=[[Survivor Series (1996)]]|credits=World Wrestling Federation|airdate=1996-11-17}}</ref> Maivia was a clean-cut heroic character who was pushed heavily from the start and won the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] despite his wrestling inexperience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1997/raw021397 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026201823/http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1997%2Fraw021397 |archivedate=October 26, 2006 |title=WWF Thursday RAW: February 13, 1997 |publisher=The Other Arena |accessdate=March 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322532 |title=Rocky Maivia's first Intercontinental Championship reign |publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]] |accessdate=March 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410102450/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322532 |archivedate=April 10, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref> This was during a transitional, but more edgy period that would lead to the [[Attitude Era]], therefore audiences became increasingly hostile toward Maivia, with chants of \"Die, Rocky, die!\" and \"Rocky sucks!\" being heard during his matches.<ref name=\"The Rock\"/> After suffering a  [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legit]] injury in April 1997, Maivia would return as a villain character in August 1997 by joining the [[Nation of Domination]] and refusing to acknowledge the Rocky Maivia name, instead referring to himself in the third person as The Rock, insulting the audience in his promos as well as WWF television interviewers.<ref name=\"The Rock\"/> The Rock would eventually become the Nation's leader and draw good heat, then starting getting cheered while still being a villain before being officially turned back into a fan favorite character by September 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/breakdown98.html|title=In Your House 24: Breakdown 1998 results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=March 19, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514225942/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/breakdown98.html|archive-date=May 14, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/judgementday98.html|title=In Your House 25: Judgment Day 1998 results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=March 19, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128011334/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/judgementday98.html|archive-date=January 28, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> During his time in the Nation, The Rock would get back the Intercontinental Championship and held it for 265 days (the second longest in the 1990s and the longest ever since),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1997/raw120897 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026202130/http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1997%2Fraw120897 |archivedate=October 26, 2006 |title=WWF RAW: December 8, 1997 |publisher=The Other Arena |accessdate=March 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322552 |title=The Rock's second Intercontinental Championship reign |publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]] |accessdate=March 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428234605/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322552 |archivedate=April 28, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref> with his second reign being better reviewed and the [[ladder match]] in which he lost the title to Triple H at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]] being rated ****1/4 out of [[Dave Meltzer#Impact|five stars]] by journalist [[Dave Meltzer]] of ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'' (''WON'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr=2034|title=WWF SummerSlam 1998 -
