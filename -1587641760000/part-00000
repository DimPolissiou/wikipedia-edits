Kantha making was not a full-time job. Women in almost every household were expert in the art. Rural women worked at leisure time or during the lazy days of the rainy season, so taking months or even years to finish a kantha was normal.  At least five to seven sarees were needed to make a standard-size kantha. Today the old materials are replaced by new cotton cloths. Traditionally the thread was collected from the old sarees. That is rarely done today.\n\nWhen a kantha is being made, first the sarees are joined together to attain the required size, and then layers are spread out on the ground. The cloths are then smoothed, and no folds or creases are left in between. During the process, the cloth is kept flat on the ground with weights on the edges. Then the four edges are stitched and two or three rows of large running stitches are done to keep the kantha together. At this stage, the kantha can be folded and stitched at leisure time.\n\nOriginally, designs and motifs were not drawn on the cloth. The design was first outlined with needle and thread, followed by focal points, and then the filling motifs were done. In a kantha with a predominant central motif the centre was done first, followed by corner designs and the other details. In some types of kanthas (carpet, lik and sujni, etc.) wooden blocks were used to print the outline. The blocks are replaced today by patterns drawn in tracing papers.\n\n[https://www.academia.edu/7637451/Opportunities_and_Constraints_of_the_Kantha-stitch_craftswomen_in_Santiniketan_a_value_chain_analysis Modern Kantha-stitch craft industry involves a very complex multi-staged production model].<ref>Roy, Paramita and Sattwick Dey Biswas (2011).

They are subdivided into Nakshi (figured) and par tola  (patterned). Nakshi (figured) kanthas are further divided into motif or scenic kanthas.\n\n=== Lohori kantha ===\n<ref>Sources Wikipedia</ref>.\nThe name was derived from Sanskrit <ref>Sanskrit Word \"Lahari\" meaning \"Wave\"</ref>, [ as in \"'[[Soundarya Lahari]]\" or \"''[[Shivananda Lahari]]\"- Religious poetic works in  Sanskrit by [[Adi Shankara]]. It is also found in Persian Language giving the same meaning ,'lehr'', which is \"wave\". This type of kantha is particularly popular in [[Rajshahi]]. These kanthas are further divided into soja (straight or simple), Kautar khupi (pigeon coop or triangle), borfi or diamond (charchala, atchala or barachala).\n\n=== Lik or anarasi ===\n\nThe Lik or Anarasi (pineapple) type of kantha is found in the [[Chapainawabganj District|Chapainawabganj]] and [[Jessore District|Jessore]] areas. The variations are lik tan, lik tile, lik jhumka, and lik lohori.\n\n=== Cross-stitch or carpet ===\n\nThis type of kantha was introduced by the English during the British Rule in India.{{sfn|Zaman|1993|p=114}} The stitch used in this kanthas is the [[cross-stitch]].\n\n=== Sujni kantha ===\n\nThis type of kantha is found only in [[Rajshahi]] area. The popular motif used is the undulating floral and vine motif.\n\n==Influence of religion and folk belief==\n{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}\n\n==Stitches==\n{{main|Kantha}}\nThe earliest and most basic stitch found in kanthas is the ''[[running stitch]]''. The predominant form of this stitch is called the ''phor'' or kantha stitch.{{sfn|Zaman|1993|pp=44\u201345}} The other forms of stitches used are the  Chatai or ''pattern darning'', Kaitya or ''[[bending stitch]]'', ''weave running stitch'', ''[[darning stitch]]'', ''Jessore stitch'' (a variation of darning stitch), ''[[threaded running stitch]]'', Lik phor or anarasi or ghar hasia ''([[Holbein stitch|Holbein]]) stitches''. The stitches used in modern-day kantha are the ''Kasmiri stitch'' and the ''[[arrowhead stitch]]''. Stitches like the  ''[[herringbone stitch]]'', ''[[satin stitch]]'', ''[[backstitch]]'' and ''[[cross-stitch]]'' are occasionally used.{{sfn|Zaman|1993}}\n\n==Types==\nKanthas generally denote quilts used as wrappers; however, all articles made by quilting old cloth may also be referred to by the same generic name. However, depending on the size and purpose, kanthas may be divided into various articles, each with its specific names. The various types of kantha are as follows:{{sfn|Ahmad|1997|p=v}}\n* [[Quilt]] (lep in Bengali): A light quilted covering made from the old sarees/dhotis/lungis and sometimes from sheet cloths.\n* Large spread (Naksi Kantha in Bengali): An embellished quilt embroidered in traditional motifs and innovative style\n* [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] floor spread (Ason in Bengali): Cloth spread for sitting at a place of worship or for an honoured guest.\n* Cosmetic wrapper (Arshilota in Bengali): A narrow embroidered wrapper to roll and store away a woman's comb, mirror, eye kohl, vermilion, sandal paste, oil bottle, etc. Often, a tying string is used to bind the wrap, as in later day satches.\n* Wallet (Batwa thoiley in Bengali): Small envelope-shaped bag for keeping money, [[betel leaves]], etc.\n* Cover for Quran (ghilaf in Arabic and Bengali): Envelope-shaped bag to cover the Quran.\n* Prayer mats (Jainamaz in Bengali): Mats used by Muslims to say prayers.\n* Floor spread (Galicha in Bengali): Floor coverings.\n* Cloths wrapper (Bostani, guthri in Bengali): A square wrapper for books and other valuables.\n* Cover (Dhakni in Bengali): Covering cloths of various shapes and sizes.\n* Ceremonial meal spread (Daster khan in Bengali): A spread for eating place, used at meal time.\n* Pillow cover (Balisher chapa or oshar in Bengali): A flat single piece pillow cover.\n* Handkerchief (Rumal): Small and square in shape.\n* Modern-day articles: Today newer uses are found for nakshi kanthas, such as bedspreads, wall hangins, cushion covers, ladies' purses, place mats, jewellery boxes, dress fronts, skirts border, shawls and sharees.\n\n==Motifs==\nMotifs of the nakshi kantha are deeply influenced by religious belief and culture. Even though no specific strict symmetry is followed, a finely embroidered naksi kantha will always have a focal point. Most kanthas will have a [[lotus (plant)|lotus]] as focal point, and around the lotus there are often undulating vines or floral motifs, or a shari border motif. The motifs may include images of flower and leaves, birds and fish, animals, kithen forms even toilet articles.\n\nWhile most kantas have some initial pattern, no two naksi kantas are same. While traditional motifs are repeated, the individual touch is used in  the variety of stitches, colours and shapes. The notable motifs found in naksi kantha are as follows:\n\n===Lotus motif===\n[[File:Lotus motif.JPG|thumb|right|Lotus motif]]\nThe lotus motif is the most common motif found in kanthas. This motif is associated with Hindu iconography and thus is also very popular in the kantha. The  lotus is the divine seat. It is also symbolic of cosmic harmony and essential womanhood. The lotus is also the symbol of eternal order and of the union of earth, water and, sky. It represents the life-giving power of water, and is also associated with the sun for the opening and closing of the petals. It is also the symbol of the recreating power of life. With the drying up of water, the lotus dies and with the rain it springs to life again. The lotus is associated with purity and the goddess [[Laksmi]], the goddess of good fortune and abundance. There are various forms of lotus motifs, from the eight-petaled ''astadal padma'' to the hundred petaled ''satadal''. In the older kanthas, the central motif is almost always a fully bloomed lotus seen from above.\n\n===Solar motif===\nThe solar motif is closely associated with the lotus motif. Often, the lotus and the solar motifs are found together at the centre of a nakshi kantha. The solar motif symbolizes the life giving power of the sun. The sun is associated with the fire which plays a significant part in Hindu rites, both religious and matrimonial.\n\n===Moon motif===\nThe moon motif has a religious influence, and is popular amongst the Muslims. Mostly it is in the form of a crescent moon accompanied by a star. This motif is particularly found in ''jainamaz'' kanthas.\n\n===Wheel motif===\nThe wheel is a common symbol in Indian art, both Hindu and Buddhist. It is the symbol of order. The wheel also represents the world. The wheel is a popular motif in kanthas even when the maker has forgotten the significance of the symbol. The motif is relatively easy to make with ''chatai phor.''\n\n===Swastika motif===\nSu asti in [[Sanskrit]] means '''it is well'''. As a motif in Indian art, it dates back to the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. It is symbol of good fortune. It is also known as ''muchri'' or ''golok dhanda.''  With the passage of time, the design is more curvilinear than the four armed swastika of the [[Mohenjodaro]] seal. The symbolic design has significant influence in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.\n\n===Tree of life motif===\n[[File:BanglaNak1.jpg|thumb|left|Contemporary Nakshi Kantha (used as a wall hanging) with animal, fish, butterfly, tree and human figure motif]]\nThe influence of this motif in Indian art and culture (as with kantha) may be traced back to the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. ''It is likely that the Indus people conceived the pipal as the [[Tree of Life]]...with the devata inside embodying the power of fecundity.''<ref>{{cite book |last=Mukerjee |first=Radhakamal |date=1964 |title=The Flowering of Indian Art: The Growth and Spread of a Civilization |location=Bombay |publisher=Asia Pub. House |page=35 |oclc=30086718}}</ref> During the Buddhist times, the cult of the tree continued. [[Ficus religiosa|Pipal]] is sacred to the Buddha because he received enlightenment under its shade.  It reflects the fecundity of nature and is very popular in Bengal. Vines and creepers play an important role in kanthas and they contain the same symbolisation as that of tree of life. A popular motif in [[Rajshahi]] lohori is the betel leaf.\n\n===Kalka motif===\n[[File:Kalka motif.JPG|thumb|right|Close view of Kalka motif]]\nThis is a latter-day motif, dating from Mughal times.{{sfn|Zaman|1993|p=82}} The kalka or [[Paisley (design)|paisley]] motif originated in Persia and Kashmir and has become an integral image of the subcontinental decorative motif.{{sfn|Ahmad|1997|p=92}} It can be compared with a stylized leaf, mango or flame. The kalka is an attractive motif and number of varieties are experimented. Similar motifs can be found in traditional Kashmiri [[shawl]]s.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Other motifs==\n[[File:Nakshi kantha (Flower motif).JPG|thumb|300px|Close view of a contemporary Nakshi kantha with flower motif]]\n* Water Motif:\n* Mountain Motif:\n* Fish Motif:\n* Boat Motif:\n* Footprint Motif:\n* Ratha Motif:\n* Mosque Motif:\n* Panja or Open Palm Motif:\n* Agricultural Implements:\n* Animal Motifs:\n* Toilet Articles:\n* Kithen Implements:\n* Kantha Motif:\n* Palanquin Motif:\n\n==Borders==\n[[File:Kantha border1.JPG|thumb|180px|Borders from the top:rice stalk, scorpion, pea, eye, wavy or bent, amulet]] [[File:Kantha border3.JPG|thumb|180px|From the top: shamuk taga, eye border, wrench border, miscellenious borders, wave border, diamond border]]\nMost nakshi kanthas have some kind of border. Either a sari border is stitched on or a border pattern is embroidered around the kantha. The common border found in kanthas are as follows:{{sfn|Zaman|1993|p=94}} [[File:Kantha border2.JPG|thumb|left|200px|From the top: necklace border, ladder border, gut taga, chik taga, nose ring border, fish border, panch taga, bisa taga, anaj taga]]\n* The [[Rice|Paddy]] stalk or date branch (dhaner shish or khejur chari)\n* The [[Scorpion]] border(Biche par in Bengali)\n* The Wavy or bent Border (Beki in Bengali)\n* The Diamond border (Barfi)\n* The Eye border (chok par in Bengali)\n* The [[Amulet]] border (Taabiz par in Bengali)\n* The Necklace border (mala par in Bengali)\n* The Ladder Border (Moi taga)\n* The Gut taga\n* The Chick taga\n* The nolok taga\n* The Fish border (Maach par in Bengali)\n* The panch taga\n* The Bisa taga\n* The Anaj taga\n* The shamuk taga\n* The [[wrench]] border\n* The anchor (grafi par in Bengali)\n* The pen border (kalam par in Bengali)\n\n==Collections==\n\n===Bangladesh===\n* Bangla \n* Design Centre, BSCIC\n* Folk Art and Crafts Foundation\n* Bangladesh National Museum\n\n===India===\n* Ashutosh Museum, Kolkata\n* Calico Museum of Textiles, Ahmedabad\n* Gurusaday Museum, Thakurpur\n\n==Organizations which make Nakshi Kanthas==\n* Bangladesh Rural Development Board (BRDB),Karu Palli Sales Centre\n* Kumudini Handicrafts (cares), Bangladesh\n* BRAC-Aarong, Bangladesh\n{{clear}}\n\n== Controversy regarding Geographical Indication ==\nIn 2008, the Indian state of West Bengal applied for the [[Geographical Indication]] for Nakshi kantha, while Bangladesh was also a strong contender for the same.<ref>http://www.ttg-sric.iitkgp.ernet.in/GIDrive/images/gi/registered_GI_13June2016.pdf</ref> But due to absence of proper law on Geographical Indication in Bangladesh that time (which was later adopted), Bangladesh couldn't officially apply for the GI.

At this stage, the kantha can be folded and stitched at leisure time.\n\nOriginally, designs and motifs were not drawn on the cloth. The design was first outlined with needle and thread, followed by focal points, and then the filling motifs were done. In a kantha with a predominant central motif the centre was done first, followed by corner designs and the other details. In some types of kanthas (carpet, lik and sujni, etc.) wooden blocks were used to print the outline. The blocks are replaced today by patterns drawn in tracing papers.\n\n[https://www.academia.edu/7637451/Opportunities_and_Constraints_of_the_Kantha-stitch_craftswomen_in_Santiniketan_a_value_chain_analysis Modern Kantha-stitch craft industry involves a very complex multi-staged production model].<ref>Roy, Paramita and Sattwick Dey Biswas (2011).

They are subdivided into Nakshi (figured) and par tola  (patterned). Nakshi (figured) kanthas are further divided into motif or scenic kanthas.\n\n=== Lohori kantha ===\n<ref>Sources Wikipedia</ref>.\nThe name was derived from Sanskrit <ref>Sanskrit Word \"Lahari\" meaning \"Wave\"</ref>, [ as in \"'[[Soundarya Lahari]]\" or \"''[[Shivananda Lahari]]\"- Religious poetic works in  Sanskrit by [[Adi Shankara]]. It is also found in Persian Language giving the same meaning ,'lehr'', which is \"wave\". This type of kantha is particularly popular in [[Rajshahi]]. These kanthas are further divided into soja (straight or simple), Kautar khupi (pigeon coop or triangle), borfi or diamond (charchala, atchala or barachala).\n\n=== Lik or anarasi ===\n\nThe Lik or Anarasi (pineapple) type of kantha is found in the [[Chapainawabganj District|Chapainawabganj]] and [[Jessore District|Jessore]] areas. The variations are lik tan, lik tile, lik jhumka, and lik lohori.\n\n=== Cross-stitch or carpet ===\n\nThis type of kantha was introduced by the English during the British Rule in India.{{sfn|Zaman|1993|p=114}} The stitch used in this kanthas is the [[cross-stitch]].\n\n=== Sujni kantha ===\n\nThis type of kantha is found only in [[Rajshahi]] area. The popular motif used is the undulating floral and vine motif.\n\n==Influence of religion and folk belief==\n{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}\n\n==Stitches==\n{{main|Kantha}}\nThe earliest and most basic stitch found in kanthas is the ''[[running stitch]]''. The predominant form of this stitch is called the ''phor'' or kantha stitch.{{sfn|Zaman|1993|pp=44\u201345}} The other forms of stitches used are the  Chatai or ''pattern darning'', Kaitya or ''[[bending stitch]]'', ''weave running stitch'', ''[[darning stitch]]'', ''Jessore stitch'' (a variation of darning stitch), ''[[threaded running stitch]]'', Lik phor or anarasi or ghar hasia ''([[Holbein stitch|Holbein]]) stitches''. The stitches used in modern-day kantha are the ''Kasmiri stitch'' and the ''[[arrowhead stitch]]''. Stitches like the  ''[[herringbone stitch]]'', ''[[satin stitch]]'', ''[[backstitch]]'' and ''[[cross-stitch]]'' are occasionally used.{{sfn|Zaman|1993}}\n\n==Types==\nKanthas generally denote quilts used as wrappers; however, all articles made by quilting old cloth may also be referred to by the same generic name. However, depending on the size and purpose, kanthas may be divided into various articles, each with its specific names. The various types of kantha are as follows:{{sfn|Ahmad|1997|p=v}}\n* [[Quilt]] (lep in Bengali): A light quilted covering made from the old sarees/dhotis/lungis and sometimes from sheet cloths.\n* Large spread (Naksi Kantha in Bengali): An embellished quilt embroidered in traditional motifs and innovative style\n* [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] floor spread (Ason in Bengali): Cloth spread for sitting at a place of worship or for an honoured guest.\n* Cosmetic wrapper (Arshilota in Bengali): A narrow embroidered wrapper to roll and store away a woman's comb, mirror, eye kohl, vermilion, sandal paste, oil bottle, etc. Often, a tying string is used to bind the wrap, as in later day satches.\n* Wallet (Batwa thoiley in Bengali): Small envelope-shaped bag for keeping money, [[betel leaves]], etc.\n* Cover for Quran (ghilaf in Arabic and Bengali): Envelope-shaped bag to cover the Quran.\n* Prayer mats (Jainamaz in Bengali): Mats used by Muslims to say prayers.\n* Floor spread (Galicha in Bengali): Floor coverings.\n* Cloths wrapper (Bostani, guthri in Bengali): A square wrapper for books and other valuables.\n* Cover (Dhakni in Bengali): Covering cloths of various shapes and sizes.\n* Ceremonial meal spread (Daster khan in Bengali): A spread for eating place, used at meal time.\n* Pillow cover (Balisher chapa or oshar in Bengali): A flat single piece pillow cover.\n* Handkerchief (Rumal): Small and square in shape.\n* Modern-day articles: Today newer uses are found for nakshi kanthas, such as bedspreads, wall hangins, cushion covers, ladies' purses, place mats, jewellery boxes, dress fronts, skirts border, shawls and sharees.\n\n==Motifs==\nMotifs of the nakshi kantha are deeply influenced by religious belief and culture. Even though no specific strict symmetry is followed, a finely embroidered naksi kantha will always have a focal point. Most kanthas will have a [[lotus (plant)|lotus]] as focal point, and around the lotus there are often undulating vines or floral motifs, or a shari border motif. The motifs may include images of flower and leaves, birds and fish, animals, kithen forms even toilet articles.\n\nWhile most kantas have some initial pattern, no two naksi kantas are same. While traditional motifs are repeated, the individual touch is used in  the variety of stitches, colours and shapes. The notable motifs found in naksi kantha are as follows:\n\n===Lotus motif===\n[[File:Lotus motif.JPG|thumb|right|Lotus motif]]\nThe lotus motif is the most common motif found in kanthas. This motif is associated with Hindu iconography and thus is also very popular in the kantha. The  lotus is the divine seat. It is also symbolic of cosmic harmony and essential womanhood. The lotus is also the symbol of eternal order and of the union of earth, water and, sky. It represents the life-giving power of water, and is also associated with the sun for the opening and closing of the petals. It is also the symbol of the recreating power of life. With the drying up of water, the lotus dies and with the rain it springs to life again. The lotus is associated with purity and the goddess [[Laksmi]], the goddess of good fortune and abundance. There are various forms of lotus motifs, from the eight-petaled ''astadal padma'' to the hundred petaled ''satadal''. In the older kanthas, the central motif is almost always a fully bloomed lotus seen from above.\n\n===Solar motif===\nThe solar motif is closely associated with the lotus motif. Often, the lotus and the solar motifs are found together at the centre of a nakshi kantha. The solar motif symbolizes the life giving power of the sun. The sun is associated with the fire which plays a significant part in Hindu rites, both religious and matrimonial.\n\n===Moon motif===\nThe moon motif has a religious influence, and is popular amongst the Muslims. Mostly it is in the form of a crescent moon accompanied by a star. This motif is particularly found in ''jainamaz'' kanthas.\n\n===Wheel motif===\nThe wheel is a common symbol in Indian art, both Hindu and Buddhist. It is the symbol of order. The wheel also represents the world. The wheel is a popular motif in kanthas even when the maker has forgotten the significance of the symbol. The motif is relatively easy to make with ''chatai phor.''\n\n===Swastika motif===\nSu asti in [[Sanskrit]] means '''it is well'''. As a motif in Indian art, it dates back to the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. It is symbol of good fortune. It is also known as ''muchri'' or ''golok dhanda.''  With the passage of time, the design is more curvilinear than the four armed swastika of the [[Mohenjodaro]] seal. The symbolic design has significant influence in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.\n\n===Tree of life motif===\n[[File:BanglaNak1.jpg|thumb|left|Contemporary Nakshi Kantha (used as a wall hanging) with animal, fish, butterfly, tree and human figure motif]]\nThe influence of this motif in Indian art and culture (as with kantha) may be traced back to the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. ''It is likely that the Indus people conceived the pipal as the [[Tree of Life]]...with the devata inside embodying the power of fecundity.''<ref>{{cite book |last=Mukerjee |first=Radhakamal |date=1964 |title=The Flowering of Indian Art: The Growth and Spread of a Civilization |location=Bombay |publisher=Asia Pub. House |page=35 |oclc=30086718}}</ref> During the Buddhist times, the cult of the tree continued. [[Ficus religiosa|Pipal]] is sacred to the Buddha because he received enlightenment under its shade.  It reflects the fecundity of nature and is very popular in Bengal. Vines and creepers play an important role in kanthas and they contain the same symbolisation as that of tree of life. A popular motif in [[Rajshahi]] lohori is the betel leaf.\n\n===Kalka motif===\n[[File:Kalka motif.JPG|thumb|right|Close view of Kalka motif]]\nThis is a latter-day motif, dating from Mughal times.{{sfn|Zaman|1993|p=82}} The kalka or [[Paisley (design)|paisley]] motif originated in Persia and Kashmir and has become an integral image of the subcontinental decorative motif.{{sfn|Ahmad|1997|p=92}} It can be compared with a stylized leaf, mango or flame. The kalka is an attractive motif and number of varieties are experimented. Similar motifs can be found in traditional Kashmiri [[shawl]]s.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Other motifs==\n[[File:Nakshi kantha (Flower motif).JPG|thumb|300px|Close view of a contemporary Nakshi kantha with flower motif]]\n* Water Motif:\n* Mountain Motif:\n* Fish Motif:\n* Boat Motif:\n* Footprint Motif:\n* Ratha Motif:\n* Mosque Motif:\n* Panja or Open Palm Motif:\n* Agricultural Implements:\n* Animal Motifs:\n* Toilet Articles:\n* Kithen Implements:\n* Kantha Motif:\n* Palanquin Motif:\n\n==Borders==\n[[File:Kantha border1.JPG|thumb|180px|Borders from the top:rice stalk, scorpion, pea, eye, wavy or bent, amulet]] [[File:Kantha border3.JPG|thumb|180px|From the top: shamuk taga, eye border, wrench border, miscellenious borders, wave border, diamond border]]\nMost nakshi kanthas have some kind of border. Either a sari border is stitched on or a border pattern is embroidered around the kantha. The common border found in kanthas are as follows:{{sfn|Zaman|1993|p=94}} [[File:Kantha border2.JPG|thumb|left|200px|From the top: necklace border, ladder border, gut taga, chik taga, nose ring border, fish border, panch taga, bisa taga, anaj taga]]\n* The [[Rice|Paddy]] stalk or date branch (dhaner shish or khejur chari)\n* The [[Scorpion]] border(Biche par in Bengali)\n* The Wavy or bent Border (Beki in Bengali)\n* The Diamond border (Barfi)\n* The Eye border (chok par in Bengali)\n* The [[Amulet]] border (Taabiz par in Bengali)\n* The Necklace border (mala par in Bengali)\n* The Ladder Border (Moi taga)\n* The Gut taga\n* The Chick taga\n* The nolok taga\n* The Fish border (Maach par in Bengali)\n* The panch taga\n* The Bisa taga\n* The Anaj taga\n* The shamuk taga\n* The [[wrench]] border\n* The anchor (grafi par in Bengali)\n* The pen border (kalam par in Bengali)\n\n==Collections==\n\n===Bangladesh===\n* Bangla \n* Design Centre, BSCIC\n* Folk Art and Crafts Foundation\n* Bangladesh National Museum\n\n===India===\n* Ashutosh Museum, Kolkata\n* Calico Museum of Textiles, Ahmedabad\n* Gurusaday Museum, Thakurpur\n\n==Organizations which make Nakshi Kanthas==\n* Bangladesh Rural Development Board (BRDB),Karu Palli Sales Centre\n* Kumudini Handicrafts (cares), Bangladesh\n* BRAC-Aarong, Bangladesh\n{{clear}}\n\n== Controversy regarding Geographical Indication ==\nIn 2008, the Indian state of West Bengal applied for the [[Geographical Indication]] for Nakshi kantha, while Bangladesh was also a strong contender for the same.<ref>http://www.ttg-sric.iitkgp.ernet.in/GIDrive/images/gi/registered_GI_13June2016.pdf</ref> But due to absence of proper law on Geographical Indication in Bangladesh that time (which was later adopted), Bangladesh couldn't officially apply for the GI.

The cathedral was created in honor to the [[Russia]]n soldiers who died during the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878]], as a result of which Bulgaria was liberated from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule.\n\nThe cathedral was designed by [[Alexander Pomerantsev]], aided by Alexander Smirnov and Alexander Yakovlev, as the initial 1884-1885 project of [[Ivan Bogomolov]] was radically changed by Pomerantsev. The final design was finished in 1898, and the construction and decoration were done by a team of Bulgarian, Russian, [[Austro-Hungarian]] and other European artists, architects and workers, including the aforementioned architects, as well as [[Petko Momchilov]], [[Yordan Milanov]], [[Haralampi Tachev]], [[Ivan Mrkvi\u010dka]], [[Vasily Bolotnov]], [[Nikolay Bruni]], [[Alexander Kiselyov (painter)|Alexander Kiselyov]], [[Anton Mitov]] and many others.\n[[File:Alexander Nevsky Cathedral 36.jpg|thumb|left|Interior]]\nThe marble parts and the lighting fixtures were created in [[Munich]], the metal elements for the gates in [[Berlin]], while the gates themselves were manufactured in Karl Bamberg's factory in [[Vienna]], and the mosaics were shipped from [[Venice]].\n\n==Name changes==\nThe name of the cathedral was briefly changed<ref name=MD/> to the Sts. [[Cyril and Methodius]] Cathedral between 1916 and 1920 (since Bulgaria and Russia belonged to [[Bulgaria during World War I|opposing alliances]] in [[World War I]]), but then the initial name was restored. The St. Alexander Nevsky Cathedral was consecrated on 12 September 1924 and in 1955 was declared a cultural monument.\n\n==Relics==\nTo the left of the altar is a case displaying [[relic]]s of [[Alexander Nevsky]], given by the Russian Orthodox Church.  Although the accompanying Bulgarian-language plaque refers simply to \"relics\" (\u043c\u043e\u0449\u0438), the item on display appears to be a piece of a rib.\n\n==Museum and market==\n[[File:Aleksandar-nevski15.jpg|thumb|right|'''Alexander Nevsky Cathedral''' in Sofia, with the [[National Assembly (Bulgaria)#Building|parliament]] behind.]]\n\nThere is a museum of Bulgarian icons inside the cathedral crypt, part of the [[National Art Gallery (Bulgaria)|National Art Gallery]].

The cathedral was created in honour to the [[Russia]]n soldiers who died during the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878]], as a result of which Bulgaria was liberated from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule.\n\nThe cathedral was designed by [[Alexander Pomerantsev]], aided by Alexander Smirnov and Alexander Yakovlev, as the initial 1884-1885 project of [[Ivan Bogomolov]] was radically changed by Pomerantsev. The final design was finished in 1898, and the construction and decoration were done by a team of Bulgarian, Russian, [[Austro-Hungarian]] and other European artists, architects and workers, including the aforementioned architects, as well as [[Petko Momchilov]], [[Yordan Milanov]], [[Haralampi Tachev]], [[Ivan Mrkvi\u010dka]], [[Vasily Bolotnov]], [[Nikolay Bruni]], [[Alexander Kiselyov (painter)|Alexander Kiselyov]], [[Anton Mitov]] and many others.\n[[File:Alexander Nevsky Cathedral 36.jpg|thumb|left|Interior]]\nThe marble parts and the lighting fixtures were created in [[Munich]], the metal elements for the gates in [[Berlin]], while the gates themselves were manufactured in Karl Bamberg's factory in [[Vienna]], and the mosaics were shipped from [[Venice]].\n\n==Name changes==\nThe name of the cathedral was briefly changed<ref name=MD/> to the Sts. [[Cyril and Methodius]] Cathedral between 1916 and 1920 (since Bulgaria and Russia belonged to [[Bulgaria during World War I|opposing alliances]] in [[World War I]]), but then the initial name was restored. The St. Alexander Nevsky Cathedral was consecrated on 12 September 1924 and in 1955 was declared a cultural monument.\n\n==Relics==\nTo the left of the altar is a case displaying [[relic]]s of [[Alexander Nevsky]], given by the Russian Orthodox Church.  Although the accompanying Bulgarian-language plaque refers simply to \"relics\" (\u043c\u043e\u0449\u0438), the item on display appears to be a piece of a rib.\n\n==Museum and market==\n[[File:Aleksandar-nevski15.jpg|thumb|right|'''Alexander Nevsky Cathedral''' in Sofia, with the [[National Assembly (Bulgaria)#Building|parliament]] behind.]]\n\nThere is a museum of Bulgarian icons inside the cathedral crypt, part of the [[National Art Gallery (Bulgaria)|National Art Gallery]]. The church claims that the museum contains the largest collection of Orthodox icons in [[Europe]].\n\n==Nearby locations==\nThe cathedral is adjacent to [[Hagia Sophia Church|St. Sofia Church]], the church for which the city of Sofia is named.  Other notable landmarks in the immediate vicinity of the cathedral are the [[Monument to the Unknown Soldier, Sofia|Monument to the Unknown Soldier]], the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]], the National Gallery of Foreign Art, the National Art Academy, the Bulgarian Parliament, a park honoring [[Ivan Vazov]] with his monument and gravestone, the Sofia Opera and Ballet, and a park where one can buy handmade textiles, icons, and antiques in a small [[flea market]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery perrow=\"4\">\n<!-- Deleted image removed: File:Cathedral and gallery of foreign arts.jpg|View of the church towards the east, with the [[National Gallery for Foreign Art]] behind -->\n\nFile:Cathedral, Alexander Nevsky.jpg|Alexander Nevsky Cathedral\nFile:Bulgaria-Alexander Nevsky-02.JPG|Front facade\nFile:AlexanderNevskyCathedral.jpg|Main facade\nFile:AlexanderNevskyCathedral1.jpg|Side facade\nFile:NevskiCathedral.jpg|The church by dawn\nImage:Bulgaria-Alexander Nevsky-08.JPG|The church by night\nFile:AlexanderNevskyCathedral2.jpg|Inside the Cathedral: the Royal thrones\nFile:Alexander Nevsky Cathedral E1.jpg|The outside of the church is decorated with mosaics of various saints\nFile:Nevsky Cathedral Drone.jpg\nFile:Cathedral Saint Alexander Nevsky (23997180108).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Bulgaria|Christianity}}\n*[[List of churches in Sofia]]\n*[[List of large Orthodox cathedrals]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Sofia}}\n* [http://stara-sofia.com/plnevski.html Old photographs of the Nevsky Cathedral]\n* [http://www.sight3d.com/sights/Alexander-Nevsky-Cathedral Three dimensional rendering of Alexander Nevsky Cathedral] (without plugin; in English, Spanish, German)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k8lasEfJuM 3D Laser scanning of Alexander Nevsky Cathedral]\n\n[[Category:Cathedrals in Bulgaria]]\n[[Category:Cathedrals in Sofia]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian Orthodox cathedrals]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Sofia]]\n[[Category:Churches completed in 1912]]\n[[Category:20th-century Eastern Orthodox church buildings]]\n[[Category:Church buildings with domes]]\n[[Category:Byzantine Revival architecture in Bulgaria]]\n[[Category:Alexander Nevsky cathedrals|Sofia]]\n[[Category:1912 establishments in Bulgaria]]\n[[Category:Religious museums in Bulgaria]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian Orthodox churches in Sofia]]\n", "name_user": "CaptainAnarchy", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Nevsky_Cathedral,_Sofia"}

The current chairman of the club is Liam Lynch.\n\nThey are the current{{when|date=April 2012}} holders of the Kerry Senior Club Championship. They were relegated for the first time ever to Division 2 of the Co.League in 2008. They then won Division 2 in 2010 backing that up by claiming the Division 1 crown the following and first season back at the top level, only one of a select few teams to do so. They club are building for the future having run the winners of the last three County Championship's down to the wire in the last three seasons, South Kerry in 2009 and Dr. Crokes in 2010 and 2011 only losing by the minimum. The current squad is a young one with most of the squad under 23 years of age, aided by a few more experienced players with Inter County experience such as Kieran Donaghy, Daniel Bohan and William Kirby.

They then won Division 2 in 2010 backing that up by claiming the Division 1 crown the following and first season back at the top level, only one of a select few teams to do so. They club are building for the future having run the winners of the last three County Championship's down to the wire in the last three seasons, South Kerry in 2009 and Dr. Crokes in 2010 and 2011 only losing by the minimum. The current squad is a young one with most of the squad under 23 years of age, aided by a few more experienced players with Inter County experience such as Kieran Donaghy, Daniel Bohan and William Kirby.

It was essentially an updated version of the pre-World War II \u0160koda Popular. In the autumn of 1948, \u0160koda (along with all other large manufacturers) became part of the communist [[planned economy]], which meant it was separated from the parent company, [[\u0160koda Works]]. In spite of unfavourable political conditions and losing contact with technical development in non-communist countries, \u0160koda retained a good reputation until the 1960s, producing models such as the \u0160koda 440 Spartak, 445 Octavia, [[\u0160koda Felicia (1959\u201364)|Felicia]] and \u0160koda 1000 MB.\n\n[[File:13-04-05-Skoda Museum Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav by RalfR-122.jpg|thumb|\u0160koda Octavia Super (1960)]]\nIn late 1959, the \u0160koda Felicia, a compact four-cylinder convertible coupe, was imported into the United States for model year 1960. Its retail price was around US$2,700, for which one could purchase a nicely-equipped V8 domestic car that was larger, more comfortable, and had more luxury and convenience features (gasoline retailed for less than 30 cents per gallon, so fuel economy was not of primary importance in the United States at that time). Those Felicias that made it to American ownership soon had a number of reliability problems, further damaging the car's reputation. The Felicia was therefore a poor seller in the States and leftover cars ended up being hied off at a fraction of the original retail list. Since that time, \u0160koda automobiles have not been imported into the U.S. for retail sale.\n\n[[File:13-04-05-Skoda Museum Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav by RalfR-121.jpg|thumb|\u0160koda MB 1000 (1966)]]\nIn the late 1980s, \u0160koda (then named ''Automobilov\u00e9 z\u00e1vody, n\u00e1rodn\u00ed podnik'' or abbreviated ''AZNP'') was still manufacturing cars that conceptually dated back to the 1960s.

The Favorit's appearance was the work of the Italian design company [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]]. With some motor technology licensed from western Europe, but still using the \u0160koda-designed 1289&nbsp;cc engine, \u0160koda engineers designed a car comparable to western production. The technological gap was still there, but began closing rapidly. The Favorit was very popular in Czechoslovakia and other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. It also sold well in Western Europe, especially in the UK and Denmark due to its low price and was regarded as solid and reliable. However, it was perceived as having poor value compared with contemporary Western European designs. The Favorit's trim levels were improved and it continued to be sold until the introduction of the Felicia in 1994.\n\n===Volkswagen Group subsidiary===\n[[File:Skoda Felicia outside Robinson.JPG|thumb|[[\u0160koda Felicia]] from 1994 was first new model after takeover by Volkswagen Group.]]\nThe [[fall of communism]] with the [[Velvet Revolution]] brought great changes to Czechoslovakia and most industries were subject to [[privatization]]. In the case of \u0160koda Automobile, the state authorities brought in a strong foreign partner. Volkswagen was chosen by the Czech government on 9 December 1990, and, as a result, on 28 March 1991 a joint-venture partnership agreement with Volkswagen took place, marked by the transfer of a 30% share to the [[Volkswagen Group]] on 16 April 1991. Until 1990, \u0160koda was still making its outdated range of rear engine small family cars, although it had started production of the [[\u0160koda Favorit|Favorit]] front-wheel drive hatchback in 1987 as an eventual replacement.\n\nIn the following years, \u0160koda became the fourth brand of the German group, as the Volkswagen Group raised its equity share first on 19 December 1994, to 60.3%, followed on 11 December 1995, to 70%.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u0160KODA AUTO a.s.|url=http://www.volkswagenag.com/content/vwcorp/info_center/de/talks_and_presentations/2004/10/eastern_europe_investor.-bin.acq/qual-BinaryStorageItem.Single.File/20041006_mlada_boleslav.pdf|publisher=Volkswagen Group|author=Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav|date=6 October 2004}}</ref>\n\nIn the competition for \u0160koda, Volkswagen was pitted against French car-maker [[Renault]], which lost out because its strategic plan did not include producing high-value models in the Czech factories; Renault proposed to manufacture the [[Renault Twingo]] [[city car]] in the \u0160koda factories.\n\nAt the time the decision was made, privatization to a major German company was somewhat controversial, since there was still anti-German sentiment lingering in the Czech Republic from WW2 and its aftermath. However, it could be argued that the subsequent fortunes of other Eastern-Bloc automobile manufacturers such as [[Lada]], [[AutoVAZ]], and of [[\u0160koda Works]] itself \u2013 once ''\u0160koda Auto's'' parent company \u2013 suggested that Volkswagen's involvement was not necessarily a result of poor judgement.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nBacked by Volkswagen Group expertise and investments, the design \u2013 both style and engineering \u2013 has improved greatly. The 1994 model [[\u0160koda Felicia|Felicia]] was effectively a reskin of the Favorit, but quality and equipment improvements helped, and in the Czech Republic the car was perceived as good value for money and became popular. Sales improved across Europe, including the United Kingdom, where the Felicia was one of the best-ranking cars in customer satisfaction surveys.\n\n[[File:Skoda Octavia Combi RS (III) \u2013 Frontansicht, 20.

The Fabia, launched at the end of 1999, formed the basis for later versions of the [[Volkswagen Polo]] and [[SEAT Ibiza]], while the Octavia, launched in 1996, has shared its floorpan with a host of cars, the most popular of which is the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4]].\n\nThe perception of \u0160koda in [[Western Europe]] has completely changed since the takeover by VW,<ref>{{cite web |title=Skoda's Marketing Success Goes From Strength To Strength |url= http://www.carpages.co.uk/skoda/skoda_marketing_success_17_12_02.asp |publisher=Carpages |date=17 December 2002}}</ref> in stark comparison with the reputation of the cars throughout the 1980s described by some as \"the laughing stock\" of the automotive world.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kevin Massy |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-9859723-48.html |title=Skoda flagship to get VW's premium nav system |publisher=CNET Reviews |date=28 January 2008 |accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Kealy |url= http://www.carsales.com.au/reviews/2009/small-4x4/skoda/skoda-octavia-scout-4x4-13348 |title=Skoda Octavia Scout 4x4 |publisher=Carsales.com.au |date=16 February 2010}}</ref> As technical development progressed and attractive new models were marketed, \u0160koda's image was initially slow to improve. In the UK, a major turnabout was achieved with the ironic \"It is a \u0160koda, honest\" campaign, which began in 2000 when the Fabia launched. In a 2003 advertisement on British television, a new employee on the production line is fitting \u0160koda badges on the car bonnets.

The team had competed as a manufacturer in the [[Intercontinental Rally Challenge]] (before it merged with ERC in 2013) and [[World Rally Championship]] between 1999 and 2005. Now it competes in the [[European Rally Championship]] and [[WRC-2]].\n\nUntil the final season of IRC in 2012, \u0160koda Motorsport was the most successful manufacturer with a total of 27 points, winning the rallying series in 2010\u20132012. Since 2013, When the two competing series were merged, it continued to compete in the European Rally Championship.\n\n\u0160koda Motorsport drivers won with the [[\u0160koda Fabia S2000]] the European Rally Championships in 2012\u20132014.\n\n===World Rally Championship===\n{{main|World Rally Championship}}\nFollowing a long history of class victories in lower levels of motorsport, \u0160koda became a participant in the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] World Rally Championship in the [[1999 World Rally Championship season|1999 season]], with [[World Rally Car]] models of the [[\u0160koda Octavia]]. \u0160koda's best result with the Octavia WRC was [[Armin Schwarz]]'s third place at the 2001 [[Safari Rally]]. From mid [[2003 World Rally Championship season|2003]], the Octavia was replaced by the smaller [[\u0160koda Fabia]]. \u0160koda used the [[2004 World Rally Championship season|2004 season]] to develop the car further, but did not achieve much success the [[2005 World Rally Championship season|following season]]. However, at the season-ending [[Rally Australia]], 1995 [[list of World Rally Championship Drivers' Champions|world champion]] [[Colin McRae]] was running second before retiring. \u0160koda then withdrew from the series, and the [[2006 World Rally Championship season|2006 season]] saw \u0160koda represented by the semi-privateer [[Red Bull]] \u0160koda Team. [[Jan Kopeck\u00fd]] drove the Fabia WRC to fifth place at the [[Rally Catalunya]], and as late as the [[2007 Rallye Deutschland]] the Fabia still achieved a fifth-place result, again in the hands of Kopeck\u00fd. Former works [[Ford World Rally Team|Ford]] and [[Citroen World Rally Team|Citroen]] driver [[Fran\u00e7ois Duval]] also drove a Fabia WRC in 2006 for the privateer First Motorsport team, achieving a sixth-place finish in Catalunya.\n\n===World Rally Championship-2===\n{{main|World Rally Championship-2}}\nIn 2009, \u0160koda entered the [[Intercontinental Rally Challenge]] (IRC) for the first time, using the Fabia S2000, winning three rallies and finishing second in both the drivers and manufacturers championship. In 2010, \u0160koda won a total of seven IRC events winning both the manufacturers and driver championship for [[Juho H\u00e4nninen]]. These achievements were repeated in the following two seasons, with [[Andreas Mikkelsen]] as the drivers' champion. In 2013, the Intercontinental Rally Challenge was merged with the [[European Rally Championship]] (ERC) and the team gained the drivers' championship title once again for [[Jan Kopeck\u00fd]]. The car was also raced by privateers in several championships, including Red Bull, Barwa, Rene Georges and Rufa in the 2010 [[Super 2000 World Rally Championship]].\n\n[[\u0160koda Motorsport]] won the 2015, 2016 and 2017 [[World Rally Championship-2|WRC-2]] championships with [[\u0160koda Fabia R5]].\n\n===Bonneville Speedway===\nIn August 2011, a special [[\u0160koda Octavia|\u0160koda Octavia

It was essentially an updated version of the pre-World War II \u0160koda Popular. In the autumn of 1948, \u0160koda (along with all other large manufacturers) became part of the communist [[planned economy]], which meant it was separated from the parent company, [[\u0160koda Works]]. In spite of unfavourable political conditions and losing contact with technical development in non-communist countries, \u0160koda retained a good reputation until the 1960s, producing models such as the \u0160koda 440 Spartak, 445 Octavia, [[\u0160koda Felicia (1959\u201364)|Felicia]] and \u0160koda 1000 MB.\n\n[[File:13-04-05-Skoda Museum Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav by RalfR-122.jpg|thumb|\u0160koda Octavia Super (1960)]]\nIn late 1959, the \u0160koda Felicia, a compact four-cylinder convertible coupe, was imported into the United States for model year 1960. Its retail price was around US$2,700, for which one could purchase a nicely-equipped V8 domestic car that was larger, more comfortable, and had more luxury and convenience features (gasoline retailed for less than 30 cents per gallon, so fuel economy was not of primary importance in the United States at that time). Those Felicias that made it to American ownership soon had a number of reliability problems, further damaging the car's reputation. The Felicia was therefore a poor seller in the States and leftover cars ended up being hied off at a fraction of the original retail list. Since that time, \u0160koda automobiles have not been imported into the U.S. for retail sale.\n\n[[File:13-04-05-Skoda Museum Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav by RalfR-121.jpg|thumb|\u0160koda MB 1000 (1966)]]\nIn the late 1980s, \u0160koda (then named ''Automobilov\u00e9 z\u00e1vody, n\u00e1rodn\u00ed podnik'' or abbreviated ''AZNP'') was still manufacturing cars that conceptually dated back to the 1960s. [[Rear-engine design|Rear-engined]] models such as the [[\u0160koda 120|\u0160koda 105/120]] (Estelle) and [[\u0160koda Rapid (1984)|Rapid]] sold steadily and performed well against more modern makes in races such as the [[RAC Rally]] in the 1970s and 1980s. They won their class in the RAC rally for 17 years running. They were powered by a {{convert|130|bhp|0|lk=in}}, {{convert|1289|cc|1|lk=on}} engine. In spite of its dated image and becoming the subject of negative jokes \u2013 What do you call a \u0160koda with a sunroof?

The Favorit's appearance was the work of the Italian design company [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]]. With some motor technology licensed from western Europe, but still using the \u0160koda-designed 1289&nbsp;cc engine, \u0160koda engineers designed a car comparable to western production. The technological gap was still there, but began closing rapidly. The Favorit was very popular in Czechoslovakia and other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. It also sold well in Western Europe, especially in the UK and Denmark due to its low price and was regarded as solid and reliable. However, it was perceived as having poor value compared with contemporary Western European designs. The Favorit's trim levels were improved and it continued to be sold until the introduction of the Felicia in 1994.\n\n===Volkswagen Group subsidiary===\n[[File:Skoda Felicia outside Robinson.JPG|thumb|[[\u0160koda Felicia]] from 1994 was first new model after takeover by Volkswagen Group.]]\nThe [[fall of communism]] with the [[Velvet Revolution]] brought great changes to Czechoslovakia and most industries were subject to [[privatization]]. In the case of \u0160koda Automobile, the state authorities brought in a strong foreign partner. Volkswagen was chosen by the Czech government on 9 December 1990, and, as a result, on 28 March 1991 a joint-venture partnership agreement with Volkswagen took place, marked by the transfer of a 30% share to the [[Volkswagen Group]] on 16 April 1991. Until 1990, \u0160koda was still making its outdated range of rear engine small family cars, although it had started production of the [[\u0160koda Favorit|Favorit]] front-wheel drive hatchback in 1987 as an eventual replacement.\n\nIn the following years, \u0160koda became the fourth brand of the German group, as the Volkswagen Group raised its equity share first on 19 December 1994, to 60.3%, followed on 11 December 1995, to 70%.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u0160KODA AUTO a.s.|url=http://www.volkswagenag.com/content/vwcorp/info_center/de/talks_and_presentations/2004/10/eastern_europe_investor.-bin.acq/qual-BinaryStorageItem.Single.File/20041006_mlada_boleslav.pdf|publisher=Volkswagen Group|author=Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav|date=6 October 2004}}</ref>\n\nIn the competition for \u0160koda, Volkswagen was pitted against French car-maker [[Renault]], which lost out because its strategic plan did not include producing high-value models in the Czech factories; Renault proposed to manufacture the [[Renault Twingo]] [[city car]] in the \u0160koda factories.\n\nAt the time the decision was made, privatization to a major German company was somewhat controversial, since there was still anti-German sentiment lingering in the Czech Republic from WW2 and its aftermath. However, it could be argued that the subsequent fortunes of other Eastern-Bloc automobile manufacturers such as [[Lada]], [[AutoVAZ]], and of [[\u0160koda Works]] itself \u2013 once ''\u0160koda Auto's'' parent company \u2013 suggested that Volkswagen's involvement was not necessarily a result of poor judgement.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nBacked by Volkswagen Group expertise and investments, the design \u2013 both style and engineering \u2013 has improved greatly. The 1994 model [[\u0160koda Felicia|Felicia]] was effectively a reskin of the Favorit, but quality and equipment improvements helped, and in the Czech Republic the car was perceived as good value for money and became popular. Sales improved across Europe, including the United Kingdom, where the Felicia was one of the best-ranking cars in customer satisfaction surveys.\n\n[[File:Skoda Octavia Combi RS (III) \u2013 Frontansicht, 20.

In the UK, a major turnabout was achieved with the ironic \"It is a \u0160koda, honest\" campaign, which began in 2000 when the Fabia launched. In a 2003 advertisement on British television, a new employee on the production line is fitting \u0160koda badges on the car bonnets.

The team had competed as a manufacturer in the [[Intercontinental Rally Challenge]] (before it merged with ERC in 2013) and [[World Rally Championship]] between 1999 and 2005. Now it competes in the [[European Rally Championship]] and [[WRC-2]].\n\nUntil the final season of IRC in 2012, \u0160koda Motorsport was the most successful manufacturer with a total of 27 points, winning the rallying series in 2010\u20132012. Since 2013, When the two competing series were merged, it continued to compete in the European Rally Championship.\n\n\u0160koda Motorsport drivers won with the [[\u0160koda Fabia S2000]] the European Rally Championships in 2012\u20132014.\n\n===World Rally Championship===\n{{main|World Rally Championship}}\nFollowing a long history of class victories in lower levels of motorsport, \u0160koda became a participant in the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] World Rally Championship in the [[1999 World Rally Championship season|1999 season]], with [[World Rally Car]] models of the [[\u0160koda Octavia]]. \u0160koda's best result with the Octavia WRC was [[Armin Schwarz]]'s third place at the 2001 [[Safari Rally]]. From mid [[2003 World Rally Championship season|2003]], the Octavia was replaced by the smaller [[\u0160koda Fabia]]. \u0160koda used the [[2004 World Rally Championship season|2004 season]] to develop the car further, but did not achieve much success the [[2005 World Rally Championship season|following season]]. However, at the season-ending [[Rally Australia]], 1995 [[list of World Rally Championship Drivers' Champions|world champion]] [[Colin McRae]] was running second before retiring. \u0160koda then withdrew from the series, and the [[2006 World Rally Championship season|2006 season]] saw \u0160koda represented by the semi-privateer [[Red Bull]] \u0160koda Team. [[Jan Kopeck\u00fd]] drove the Fabia WRC to fifth place at the [[Rally Catalunya]], and as late as the [[2007 Rallye Deutschland]] the Fabia still achieved a fifth-place result, again in the hands of Kopeck\u00fd. Former works [[Ford World Rally Team|Ford]] and [[Citroen World Rally Team|Citroen]] driver [[Fran\u00e7ois Duval]] also drove a Fabia WRC in 2006 for the privateer First Motorsport team, achieving a sixth-place finish in Catalunya.\n\n===World Rally Championship-2===\n{{main|World Rally Championship-2}}\nIn 2009, \u0160koda entered the [[Intercontinental Rally Challenge]] (IRC) for the first time, using the Fabia S2000, winning three rallies and finishing second in both the drivers and manufacturers championship. In 2010, \u0160koda won a total of seven IRC events winning both the manufacturers and driver championship for [[Juho H\u00e4nninen]]. These achievements were repeated in the following two seasons, with [[Andreas Mikkelsen]] as the drivers' champion. In 2013, the Intercontinental Rally Challenge was merged with the [[European Rally Championship]] (ERC) and the team gained the drivers' championship title once again for [[Jan Kopeck\u00fd]]. The car was also raced by privateers in several championships, including Red Bull, Barwa, Rene Georges and Rufa in the 2010 [[Super 2000 World Rally Championship]].\n\n[[\u0160koda Motorsport]] won the 2015, 2016 and 2017 [[World Rally Championship-2|WRC-2]] championships with [[\u0160koda Fabia R5]].\n\n===Bonneville Speedway===\nIn August 2011, a special [[\u0160koda Octavia|\u0160koda Octavia

It was released on 25 July 1980 by [[Albert Productions]] and [[Atlantic Records]]. It is the band's first album to feature vocalist [[Brian Johnson]], following the death of previous vocalist [[Bon Scott]].\n\nAfter the commercial breakthrough of their 1979 album ''[[Highway to Hell]]'', AC/DC was planning to record a follow-up, but in February 1980, Scott died from alcohol poisoning after a drinking binge. Instead of disbanding, they decided to continue on and recruited Johnson, who was previously vocalist for [[Geordie (band)|Geordie]].\n\nThe album was composed by Johnson, [[Angus Young|Angus]] and [[Malcolm Young]], and recorded over seven weeks in the [[Bahamas]] from April to May 1980 with producer [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]], who had worked on their previous album. Following its completion, the group mixed ''Back in Black'' at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in [[New York City]]. The album's all-black cover was designed as a \"sign of mourning\" for Scott.\n\nAs their sixth international studio release, ''Back in Black'' was an unprecedented success. It has sold an estimated 50 million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Kai |last= Ma |title= Heavy Metal Under the Sea: Sharks Act Calmer When Listening to AC/DC |magazine= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url= http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/06/06/heavy-metal-under-the-sea-sharks-act-calmer-when-listening-to-acdc/ |date= 6 June 2011 |accessdate= 5 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first= Phil |last= Sutcliffe |title= AC/DC: High-Voltage Rock 'n' Roll: The Ultimate Illustrated History |year= 2010 |publisher= [[Quarto Group|Voyageur Press]]}}</ref><ref>McNamee, Gregory (24 August 2010). {{cite web|url= http://www.britannica.com/blogs/2010/08/acdc-back-in-black-great-moments-in-pop-music-history/ |title= AC/DC, \"Back in Black\" (Great Moments in Pop Music History) |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140821051008/http://www.britannica.com/blogs/2010/08/acdc-back-in-black-great-moments-in-pop-music-history/ |archivedate= 21 August 2014}}.

On 19 February 1980, Scott went on a [[drinking binge]] in a London pub that caused him to lose consciousness, so a friend let him rest in the back of his [[Renault 5]] overnight. The next morning, Scott was found unresponsive and rushed to [[King's College Hospital]] where medical personnel pronounced him [[dead on arrival]].

Johnson recalled that: \"It was hardly any kind of studio, we were in these little concrete cells, comfy mind, you had a bed and a chair. And this big old black lady ran the whole place. Oh, she was fearsome, she ruled that place with a rod of iron. We had to lock the doors at night because she'd warned us about these Haitians who'd come down at night and rob the place.

Nonetheless, she concurred with Fricke's original view of the album as a heavy metal masterpiece while naming it her favourite album ever, \"the obsessive soundtrack of my adolescence, the racy

Harrington, ''Back in Black'' was released at a time when heavy metal stood at a turning point between a decline and a revival, as most bands in the genre were playing slower tempos and longer guitar solos, while AC/DC and [[Van Halen]] adopted punk rock's \"high-energy implications\" and \"constricted their songs into more pop-oriented blasts\". Harrington credited producer Lange for drawing AC/DC further away from the blues-oriented rock of their previous albums, and toward a more dynamic attack that concentrated and harmonized each element of the band: \"the guitars were compacted into a singular statement of rhythmic efficiency, the rhythm section provided the thunderhorse overdrive, and vocalist Johnson belowed and brayed like the most unhinged practitioner of bluesy top-man dynamics since vintage [[Robert Plant]].\" The resulting music, along with contemporaneous records by [[Mot\u00f6rhead]] and [[Ozzy Osbourne]], helped revitalize and reintroduce metal to a younger generation of listeners, \"eventually resulting in the punk-metal crossover personified by [[Metallica]] and others.\"<ref name=\"Harrington\">{{cite book|first= Joe S. |last= Harrington |year= 2003 |chapter= Back in Black |pages= 81\u201382 |editor-first= Jacob |editor-last= Hoye |title= VH-1's 100 Greatest Albums |publisher= [[Simon & Schuster]] |isbn= 0743448766}}</ref> In ''[[1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die]]'' (2008), [[Tom Moon]] said ''Back in Black''{{'}}s \"lean mean arena rock\" and the production's \"delicate balance of power and finesse\" defined the commercial side of heavy music for years after its release.\"<ref>{{cite book|first= Tom |last= Moon |year= 2008 |title= [[1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die|1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die: A Listener's Life List]] |publisher= Workman Publishing |page= [https://archive.org/details/1000recordingsto00moon_0/page/5 5] |isbn= 076113963X}}</ref>\n\nLange's production for the album had an enduring impact in the music industry;

seventh studio album by Scottish [[Rock music|rock]] band [[AC/DC]]. It was released on 25 July 1980 by [[Albert Productions]] and [[Atlantic Records]]. It is the band's first album to feature vocalist [[Brian Johnson]], following the death of previous vocalist [[Bon Scott]].\n\nAfter the commercial breakthrough of their 1979 album ''[[Highway to Hell]]'', AC/DC was planning to record a follow-up, but in February 1980, Scott died from alcohol poisoning after a drinking binge. Instead of disbanding, they decided to continue on and recruited Johnson, who was previously vocalist for [[Geordie (band)|Geordie]].\n\nThe album was composed by Johnson, [[Angus Young|Angus]] and [[Malcolm Young]], and recorded over seven weeks in the [[Bahamas]] from April to May 1980 with producer [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]], who had worked on their previous album. Following its completion, the group mixed ''Back in Black'' at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in [[New York City]]. The album's all-black cover was designed as a \"sign of mourning\" for Scott.\n\nAs their sixth international studio release, ''Back in Black'' was an unprecedented success. It has sold an estimated 50 million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Kai |last= Ma |title= Heavy Metal Under the Sea: Sharks Act Calmer When Listening to AC/DC |magazine= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url= http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/06/06/heavy-metal-under-the-sea-sharks-act-calmer-when-listening-to-acdc/ |date= 6 June 2011 |accessdate= 5 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first= Phil |last= Sutcliffe |title= AC/DC: High-Voltage Rock 'n' Roll: The Ultimate Illustrated History |year= 2010 |publisher= [[Quarto Group|Voyageur Press]]}}</ref><ref>McNamee, Gregory (24 August 2010). {{cite web|url= http://www.britannica.com/blogs/2010/08/acdc-back-in-black-great-moments-in-pop-music-history/ |title= AC/DC, \"Back in Black\" (Great Moments in Pop Music History) |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140821051008/http://www.britannica.com/blogs/2010/08/acdc-back-in-black-great-moments-in-pop-music-history/ |archivedate= 21 August 2014}}.

Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange produced the record, making the band's sound more catchy and accessible to international audiences, and it became their first platinum album in the United States, selling over one million copies, while also peaking at number 17 on that country's pop charts and number eight in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"am\"/> AC/DC, formed in 1973, first broke into international markets in 1977 with their fourth record, ''[[Let There Be Rock]]''.<ref name=\"am\">{{cite web|url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ac-dc-mn0000574772/biography |title= AC/DC \u2013 Artist Biography |publisher= [[AllMusic]].

On 19 February 1980, Scott went on a [[drinking binge]] in a London pub that caused him to lose consciousness, so a friend let him rest in the back of his [[Renault 5]] overnight. The next morning, Scott was found unresponsive and rushed to [[King's College Hospital]] where medical personnel pronounced him [[dead on arrival]]. The [[coroner]] ruled that [[pulmonary aspiration]] of vomit was the cause of Scott's death, but the official cause was listed on the death certificate as \"acute [[Alcohol intoxication#Acute alcohol poisoning|alcoholic poisoning]]\" and classified as \"[[death by misadventure]]\". Scott was cremated and his ashes were interred by his family at [[Fremantle Cemetery]] in [[Fremantle|Fremantle, Western Australia]].{{sfn|Engleheart|Durieux|2008|p=299}} The loss devastated the band, who considered breaking up. However, friends and family persuaded them to carry on.{{sfn|Engleheart|Durieux|2008|p=297}}\n\nAfter Bon Scott's funeral, the band immediately began auditions for a replacement frontman. At the advice of Lange, the group brought in Geordie singer Brian Johnson, who impressed the group.{{sfn|Engleheart|Durieux|2008|p=309}} After the band begrudgingly worked through the rest of the list of applicants in the following days, Johnson returned for a second rehearsal.{{sfn|Engleheart|Durieux|2008|p=317\u201318}} On 29 March, Malcolm Young called the singer to offer him the job, to his surprise.{{sfn|Engleheart|Durieux|2008|p=319\u201320}}\n\n==Recording and production==\n[[File:Brian Johnson - Manchester Apollo - 1982.jpg|thumb|right|This is the first album to feature [[Brian Johnson]] as vocalist.]]\nRehearsals for ''Back in Black'' were scheduled over three weeks at London's E-Zee Hire Studios, but it was cut to one week when an opening came up at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, in the Bahamas. Although they preferred to record their next effort in the UK, there were no studios available, and the Bahamas presented a nice tax advantage.{{sfn|Engleheart|Durieux|2008|p=324}}\n\n''Back in Black'' was recorded from mid-April to May 1980 at Compass Point with producer \"Mutt\" Lange. Upon their arrival, the area was being hit by several [[tropical storms]], wreaking havoc on the studio's electricity. Johnson recalled that: \"It was hardly any kind of studio, we were in these little concrete cells, comfy mind, you had a bed and a chair. And this big old black lady ran the whole place.

Nonetheless, she concurred with Fricke's original view of the album as a heavy metal masterpiece while naming it her favourite album ever, \"the obsessive soundtrack of my adolescence, the racy middle-brow thriller that spoke to me both as a tomboy who wanted to be one of the guys, and the increasingly female ingenue who needed to work out the world of men.

Harrington, ''Back in Black'' was released at a time when heavy metal stood at a turning point between a decline and a revival, as most bands in the genre were playing slower tempos and longer guitar solos, while AC/DC and [[Van Halen]] adopted punk rock's \"high-energy implications\" and \"constricted their songs into more pop-oriented blasts\". Harrington credited producer Lange for drawing AC/DC further away from the blues-oriented rock of their previous albums, and toward a more dynamic attack that concentrated and harmonized each element of the band: \"the guitars were compacted into a singular statement of rhythmic efficiency, the rhythm section provided the thunderhorse overdrive, and vocalist Johnson belowed and brayed like the most unhinged practitioner of bluesy top-man dynamics since vintage [[Robert Plant]].\" The resulting music, along with contemporaneous records by [[Mot\u00f6rhead]] and [[Ozzy Osbourne]], helped revitalize and reintroduce metal to a younger generation of listeners, \"eventually resulting in the punk-metal crossover personified by [[Metallica]] and others.\"<ref name=\"Harrington\">{{cite book|first= Joe S. |last= Harrington |year= 2003 |chapter= Back in Black |pages= 81\u201382 |editor-first= Jacob |editor-last= Hoye |title= VH-1's 100 Greatest Albums |publisher= [[Simon & Schuster]] |isbn= 0743448766}}</ref> In ''[[1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die]]'' (2008), [[Tom Moon]] said ''Back in Black''{{'}}s \"lean mean arena rock\" and the production's \"delicate balance of power and finesse\" defined the commercial side of heavy music for years after its release.\"<ref>{{cite book|first= Tom |last= Moon |year= 2008 |title= [[1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die|1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die: A Listener's Life List]] |publisher= Workman Publishing |page= [https://archive.org/details/1000recordingsto00moon_0/page/5 5] |isbn= 076113963X}}</ref>\n\nLange's production for the album had an enduring impact in the music industry;

He played for the [[France national under-21 football team]], impressing the likes of [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in the process, for whom he joined on loan in March 2001,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1220009.stm |title=Gers are fab, Collins tells Fabrice |publisher= BBC Sport|date=14 March 2001 |accessdate=23 April 2020}}</ref> scoring on his debut for the club, from 20 yards out against [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/1226592.stm|title=Fab Rangers debut at Fir Park|publisher= BBC Sport|date=17 March 2001 |accessdate=27 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2001, he moved to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/southampton/1731148.stm |title=Saints sign Fernandes |publisher= BBC Sport|date=28 December 2001 |accessdate=23 April 2020}}</ref> making his debut in a defeat to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1731074.stm|title=Leeds steal late win |publisher= BBC Sport|date=29 December 2001 |accessdate=23 April 2020}}</ref> and played in many games during the season, despite sometimes being hit with injury.

The Saints needed to reduce their payroll and engaged the services of agent [[Willie McKay]] to find a new club for him. Allegedly, McKay was paid a fee of \u00a330,000 by Southampton for his services. This transfer is amongst those being scrutinised by the [[John Stevens, Baron Stevens of Kirkwhelpington|Stevens]] enquiry into corruption in English football.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Matt|title=Quest team look into Fernandes transfer deals|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/nov/03/newsstory.sport|accessdate=19 May 2018|work=The Guardian|date=3 November 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[Sam Allardyce]] snapped him up for free at the end of August 2005<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bolton_wanderers/4202904.stm|title=Bolton snap up winger Fernandes |publisher= BBC Sport|date=31 August 2005 |accessdate=23 April 2020}}</ref> and he made his debut for Bolton in their first ever UEFA Cup game against [[Lokomotiv Plovdiv]] at the [[Reebok Stadium]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4240960.stm|title=Bolton 2-1 Lokomotiv Plovdiv |publisher=BBC|date=15 September 2005 |accessdate=16 August 2012}}</ref> He appeared once in the league for Bolton, as a substitute in a 5-1 defeat to Chelsea.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4322072.stm |title=Chelsea 5-1 Bolton |publisher=BBC|date=15 October 2005 |accessdate=16 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2006 Fernandes moved to play in [[Israel]] for [[Beitar Jerusalem]], the club owned by [[Arcadi Gaydamak]], the father of [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] owner [[Alexandre Gaydamak]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bolton_wanderers/4664402.stm|title=Bolton capture midfielder Perez |publisher= BBC Sport|date=31 January 2006 |accessdate=23 April 2020}}</ref> After leaving the Jerusalem club he has had trial spells with [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] and [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]].\n\nIn January 2007, he joined [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u015fti|Dinamo Bucharest]] ([[Romania]]) in the [[Liga I|Romanian First League]], but was released a year later.<ref name = FATS>{{cite book |last1=Chalk |first1=Gary |last2=Holley |first2=Duncan |last3=Bull |first3 =David |title=All the Saints: A Complete Players' Who's Who of Southampton FC|year=2013|location=Southampton|publisher=Hagiology Publishing|isbn=978-0-9926-8640-6|p=313}}</ref> From there he joined [[Le Havre AC|Le Havre]].\n\n==Honours==\n'''Fulham'''\n*[[Football League First Division]] champions: [[2000\u201301 Football League First Division|2000\u201301]]\n\n'''Beitar Jerusalem'''\n* [[Israeli Premier League]] champions: [[2006\u201307 Israeli Premier League|2006\u201307]]\n\n'''Southampton'''\n* [[FA Cup]] runners-up: [[2003 FA Cup Final|2003]]\n\n'''Dinamo Bucuresti'''\n* [[Liga I]] champions: [[Liga I 2006\u201307|2006\u201307]]\n* [[Supercupa Rom\u00e2niei|Romanian Supercup]] runners-up: [[2007 Supercupa Rom\u00e2niei|2007]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{RomanianSoccer|709/fabrice-fernandes.htm}}\n*{{Soccerbase}}\n*{{WorldFootball|fabrice-fernandes}}\n*{{Soccerway|11976}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fernandes, Fabrice}}\n[[Category:1979 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:French people of Portuguese descent]]\n[[Category:French footballers]]\n[[Category:Stade Rennais F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Bolton Wanderers F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Southampton F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Olympique de Marseille players]]\n[[Category:Rangers F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Fulham F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Beitar Jerusalem F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Expatriate footballers in Israel]]\n[[Category:FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti players]]\n[[Category:Le Havre AC players]]\n[[Category:French expatriate sportspeople in Israel]]\n[[Category:Premier League players]]\n[[Category:Ligue 1 players]]\n[[Category:Scottish Premier League players]]\n[[Category:French expatriate footballers]]\n[[Category:Expatriate footballers in Scotland]]\n[[Category:French expatriate sportspeople in Romania]]\n[[Category:Expatriate footballers in Romania]]\n[[Category:Liga I players]]\n[[Category:Expatriate footballers in England]]\n[[Category:French expatriate sportspeople in England]]\n[[Category:Association football wingers]]\n", "name_user": "Daemonickangaroo2018", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePlaying career", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabrice_Fernandes"}
