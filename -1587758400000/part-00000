The film is set in and around [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], where it was filmed.  The film's screenplay was written by Aykroyd and Landis. It features musical numbers by [[rhythm and blues]] (R&B), [[Soul music|soul]], and [[blues]] singers [[James Brown]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Ray Charles]], and [[John Lee Hooker]]. It features non-musical supporting performances by [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Henry Gibson]], [[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]] and [[John Candy]].\n\nThe story is a tale of [[wikt:redeem|redemption]] for paroled convict Jake and his [[blood brother]] Elwood, who set out on \"a mission from God\" to save from foreclosure the Catholic orphanage in which they were raised. To do so, they must reunite their R&B band and organize a performance to earn $5,000 needed to pay the orphanage's [[property tax]] bill. Along the way, they are targeted by a homicidal \"mystery woman\", [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazis]], and a [[country music|country and western]] band\u2014all while being relentlessly pursued by the police.\n\n[[Universal Studios]], which had won the bidding war for the film, was hoping to take advantage of Belushi's popularity in the wake of ''Saturday Night Live'', ''[[Animal House]]'', and the Blues Brothers' musical success; it soon found itself unable to control production costs. The start of filming was delayed when Aykroyd, new to film screenwriting, took six months to deliver a long and unconventional script that Landis had to rewrite before production, which began without a final budget. On location in Chicago, Belushi's partying and drug use caused lengthy and costly delays that, along with the destructive car chases depicted onscreen, made the final film one of the most expensive comedies ever produced.\n\nConcerns that the film would fail limited its initial bookings to less than half those a film of its magnitude normally received. Released in the United States on June 20, 1980, it received mostly positive reviews. It earned just under $5 million in its opening weekend and went on to gross over $115 million in theaters worldwide before its release on home video. It has become a [[cult film|cult]] [[cult following|classic]], spawning the [[sequel]], ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'', 18 years later, which was a critical and commercial failure.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Blues]] vocalist and [[petty criminal]] \"Joliet\" Jake Blues is [[paroled]] on [[Good conduct time|good behavior]] grounds from [[Joliet Correctional Center]] after serving three years of a five-year sentence, and is picked up by his [[blood brother]] Elwood in his [[Bluesmobile]], a battered, decommissioned police car. Elwood demonstrates its capabilities by jumping an open [[drawbridge]]. The brothers visit the [[Roman Catholic]] [[orphanage]] where they were raised, and learn from Sister Mary \"the Penguin\" Stigmata and old friend Curtis that it will be closed unless $5,000 in [[property tax]]es is collected. Jake offers to steal the money, but Sister Mary is offended. During a sermon by the Reverend Cleophus James at the Triple Rock [[Missionary Baptist|Baptist]] Church, Jake has another idea: they can re-form their band, [[the Blues Brothers]], which disbanded while Jake was in prison, and raise the money to save the orphanage.\n\nThat night, state troopers attempt to arrest Elwood for driving with a suspended license. After a high-speed chase through the [[Dixie Square Mall]], the brothers flee to the [[flophouse]] where Elwood lives, miraculously escaping a [[rocket launcher]] attack by a mysterious woman. The next morning, as the police arrive at the house, the woman detonates a [[bomb]] that demolishes the building, but somehow leaves Jake and Elwood unharmed, and saves them from being apprehended.\n\nJake and Elwood begin tracking down members of the band. Five of them are playing a [[Holiday Inn]] lounge as \"Murph and the Magic Tones,\" and quickly agree to rejoin. The sixth member, \"[[Alan Rubin|Mr. Fabulous]]\", turns them down as he is the [[ma\u00eetre d']] at expensive restaurant \"Chez Paul\", but the brothers behave obnoxiously in the restaurant until he relents. On their way to meet the final two band members, the brothers find the road through [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]] blocked by an \"[[American Nazi Party|American Socialist White People's Party]]\"\u2014\"the Illinois Nazis\"\u2014demonstration on a bridge. It is mentioned that \"The Nazis\" won their court case, likely a reference to [[National_Socialist_Party_of_America_v._Village_of_Skokie | The Skokie Affair]]. Elwood runs them off the bridge, forcing them to jump into the East Lagoon. The commander orders a subordinate to record the car's license number. Meanwhile, the last two band members, [[Matt \"Guitar\" Murphy]] and [[Lou Marini|\"Blue Lou\" Marini]], who now work in a [[soul food]] restaurant, rejoin the band against the advice of Murphy's wife and restaurant owner, [[Aretha Franklin]]. The reunited group obtain instruments and equipment from Ray's Music Exchange in [[Calumet City]], and Ray, \"as usual\", takes an [[IOU]].\n\nAs Jake attempts to book a gig, the mystery woman blows up the phone booth he and Elwood are using; once again, they are miraculously unhurt. The band stumbles into a gig at Bob's Country Bunker, a local [[honky-tonk]]. They win over the rowdy crowd, but run up a bar tab higher than their pay, and infuriate the country band that was actually booked there, the Good Ole Boys.\n\n[[File:Rusty-s TV and Movie Car Museum Jackson TN 018.jpg|thumb|Reproduction of the \"Bluesmobile\". Rusty's TV & Movie Car Museum, Jackson, TN.]]\nRealizing that they need one big show to raise the necessary money, the brothers persuade their old agent to book the Palace Hotel Ballroom, north of Chicago. They mount a loudspeaker atop the Bluesmobile and drive the Chicago area promoting the concert, but in the process alert the police, the Nazis, and the Good Ole Boys of their whereabouts. The ballroom is packed with blues fans, cops, and the Good Ole Boys. Jake and Elwood perform two songs, then sneak offstage, as the tax deadline is rapidly approaching. A record company executive offers them a $10,000 cash advance on a recording contract\u2014more than enough to pay off the orphanage's taxes and Ray's IOU\u2014and then shows them how to slip out of the building unnoticed. As they make their escape via a service tunnel, they are confronted by the mystery woman: Jake's vengeful ex-[[fianc\u00e9e]]. After her volley of [[M16 rifle]] bullets leaves them miraculously unharmed, Jake offers a series of ridiculous excuses that she accepts, allowing the brothers to escape to the Bluesmobile.\n\nJake and Elwood race back toward Chicago with dozens of state/local police and the Good Ole Boys in pursuit. They eventually elude them all with a series of improbable maneuvers, including a miraculous gravity-defying escape from the Illinois Nazis. At the [[Richard J. Daley Center]], they rush inside the adjacent [[Chicago City Hall]] building, soon followed by hundreds of police, state troopers, SWAT teams, firefighters, Illinois National Guardsmen, and the Military Police. Finding the office of the [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] Assessor (played by [[Steven Spielberg]]), the brothers pay the tax bill. Just as their receipt is stamped, they are arrested by the mob of law officers. In prison, the band plays \"[[Jailhouse Rock (song)|Jailhouse Rock]]\" for the inmates.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[John Belushi]] as \"Joliet\" Jake Blues, a former blues singer, paroled from prison after three years.\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Elwood Blues, Jake's blood brother, also a former blues singer.\n* [[James Brown]] as Reverend Cleophus James, a reverend of the Triple Rock Baptist Church.

The name \"The Blues Brothers\" was the idea of [[Howard Shore]]. The fictional back story and character sketches of blood brothers Jake and Elwood were developed by Aykroyd in collaboration with Ron Gwynne, who is credited as a story consultant for the film. As related in the liner notes of the band's debut album, ''[[Briefcase Full of Blues]]'', the brothers grew up in an orphanage, learned the blues from a janitor named Curtis, and sealed their brotherhood by cutting their middle fingers with a steel string said to have come from the guitar of [[Elmore James]].<ref name=\"Bio\">{{cite web | title=Fortune City-Blues Brothers | work=Biography of the Blues Brothers-From their album, A Briefcase Full of Blues | url=http://www.fortunecity.com/tinpan/fitzgerald/12/bio.html|accessdate=December 16, 2008}}</ref>\n\nBelushi had become a star in 1978 as a result of both the Blues Brothers' musical success and his role in ''National Lampoon's Animal House''. At one point, he managed the triple feat of being the star of the week's top-grossing film, top-rated television show, and singing on the number-one album within a year. When Aykroyd and Belushi decided they could make a Blues Brothers film, the bidding war was intense. [[Universal Studios]] narrowly beat [[Paramount Pictures]] for the project. John Landis, who had directed Belushi in ''Animal House'', was aboard as director.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\">{{cite news|last=Zeman|first=Ned|title=Soul Men: The Making of The Blues Brothers|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/01/making-of-blues-brothers-budget-for-cocaine|newspaper=Vanity Fair|date=January 2013|accessdate=December 18, 2012}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the project had neither a budget nor a script. On the former issue, Universal head [[Lew Wasserman]] thought the film could be made for $12 million; the filmmakers wanted $20 million. It would be impossible to settle on a specific amount without a screenplay to review, and after [[Mitch Glazer]] declined to help him, Aykroyd wrote one on his own.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\" />\n\nAykroyd had never written a screenplay before, as he admitted in the 1998 documentary, ''Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers'', or even read one, and he was unable to find a writing partner. Consequently, he put together a very descriptive volume that explained the characters' origins and how the band members were recruited. His final draft was 324 pages, which was three times longer than a standard screenplay, written not in a standard [[Screenplay#Format and style|screenplay format]], but more like [[free verse]].<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\" /> To soften the impact, Aykroyd made a joke of the thick script and had it bound with the cover of the [[Los Angeles]] Yellow Pages directory for when he turned it in to producer [[Robert K. Weiss]]. He titled it The Return of the Blues Brothers, and credited it to \"By Scriptatron GL-9000\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/01/making-of-blues-brothers-budget-for-cocaine | title=Making Blues Brothers With John Belushi and Dan Akroyd\u2014\"We Had a Budget for Cocaine\" | first=Ned | last=Zeman | date= | website=vanityfair.com|accessdate=October 4, 2018}}</ref> Landis was given the task of editing the script into a usable screenplay,<ref name=\"DVD doc\">''Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers'', documentary feature on 1998 DVD and 25th Anniversary DVD (2005).</ref> which took him about two weeks.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\" />\n\nThe movie held the record for Most Cars Destroyed in the course of production for 18 years at 103, one less than was wrecked in ''The Blues Brothers 2000'' (1998). Both were surpassed by ''[[G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra]]'' in 2009 with 112 cars destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/419907/leading-movies-most-vehicle-damaged/|title=Movies with most cars destroyed 2013 - Statistic|author=|date=|website=Statista|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nAt Aykroyd's demand, soul and R&B stars [[James Brown]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Ray Charles]] and [[Aretha Franklin]] were cast in speaking parts to support musical numbers built around them. This caused friction between Landis and Universal later in the production, as its costs far exceeded the original budget. Since none of them except Charles had had any hits in recent years, the studio wanted the director to replace them with \u2013 or add performances by \u2013 younger acts, such as [[Rose Royce]], whose \"[[Car Wash (song)|Car Wash]]\" had made them disco stars after its use in [[Car Wash (film)|the 1976 film of that name]].<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\"/>\n\nOther musicians in the cast include [[Big Walter Horton]], [[Pinetop Perkins]], and [[John Lee Hooker]] (who performed \"Boom Boom\" during the Maxwell Street scene). The members of The Blues Brothers Band were themselves notable. Steve Cropper and Donald Dunn are architects of the [[Stax Records]] sound (Cropper's guitar can be heard at the start of the [[Sam & Dave]] song \"[[Soul Man (song)|Soul Man]]\") and were half of [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]]. Horn players Lou Marini, Tom Malone, and Alan Rubin had all played in [[Blood, Sweat & Tears]] and the ''Saturday Night Live'' band. Drummer Willie Hall had played in [[The Bar-Kays]] and backed [[Isaac Hayes]]. Matt Murphy is a veteran blues guitarist. As the band developed at ''Saturday Night Live'', pianist [[Paul Shaffer]] was part of the act and was cast in the film. However, due to contractual obligations with ''SNL'', he was unable to participate, so actor-musician Murphy Dunne (whose father, [[George Dunne]], was the Cook County Board President) was hired to take his role.<ref name=\"DVD doc\"/>\n\nFisher, Freeman, Gibson, and Candy were cast in non-musical supporting roles. The film is also notable for the number of cameo appearances by established celebrities and entertainment-industry figures, including Steve Lawrence as a booking agent, Twiggy as a \"chic lady\" in a [[Jaguar E-Type|Jaguar convertible]] whom Elwood propositions at a gas station, [[Steven Spielberg]] as the Cook County Assessor's clerk, John Landis as a state trooper in the mall chase, Paul Reubens (before [[Pee-wee Herman]]) as a waiter in the Chez Paul restaurant scene, [[Joe Walsh]] in a cameo as the first prisoner to jump up on a table in the final scene, and [[Chaka Khan]] as the soloist in the Triple Rock choir. [[The Muppets|Muppet]] puppeteer [[Frank Oz]] plays a [[Prison officer|corrections officer]], and in the scene where the brothers crash into [[Toys R Us]], a [[Grover]] and [[Kermit the Frog]] toy can be spotted and a customer (played by stunt coordinator [[Gary McLarty]]) asks the cashier if they have a [[Miss Piggy]] doll, a Muppet character that is voiced by Oz. Singer/songwriter [[Stephen Bishop (singer)|Stephen Bishop]] is a deputy sheriff who complains that Jake and Elwood broke his watch (a result of the car chase in the mall). Makeup artist [[Layne Britton]] is the old card player who asks Elwood, \"Did you get me my Cheez Whiz, boy?\" The character portrayed by Cab Calloway is named Curtis as homage to [[Curtis Salgado]], a [[Portland, Oregon]], blues musician who inspired Belushi while he was in Oregon filming ''Animal House''.<ref name=\"CS\">{{cite web|title=Biography|work=Curtis Salgado|url=http://www.curtissalgado.com/biography.html|accessdate=December 16, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017164459/http://www.curtissalgado.com/biography.html <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=October 17, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOver 500 extras were used for the next-to-last scene, the blockade of the building at [[Daley Center]], including 200 National Guardsmen, 100 state and city police officers, with 15 horses for the [[mounted police]] (and three each [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tanks]], [[helicopter]]s, and [[Fire apparatus|fire engines]]).<ref name=\"HappyRam\"/><ref name=\"Chicago Sun-Times3\">{{cite news|title=Blues Brothers 25th Anniversary|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]| url=http://www.suntimes.com/special_sections/bluebros/| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050721084943/http://www.suntimes.com/special_sections/bluebros/| archivedate=July 21, 2005|accessdate=December 16, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began in July 1979, with the film's budget still not settled. For the first month, things ran smoothly on and off the set. When Weiss saw the supposedly final $17.5 million budget, he reportedly joked, \"I think we've spent that much already.\"<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\" />\n\nIn the next month, the production began falling behind schedule. Much of the delay was due to Belushi's partying and carousing. When not on the set, he went out to his familiar Chicago haunts such as [[Wrigley Field]] and the [[Old Town Ale House, Chicago|Old Town Ale House]]. People often recognized him and slipped him cocaine, a drug he was already using heavily on his own, hoping to use it with him. \"Every blue-collar Joe wants his John Belushi story\", said Smokey Wendell, who was eventually hired to keep it away from the star. As a result of his late nights and drug and alcohol use, Belushi would often miss unit calls (the beginning of a production day) or go to his trailer after them and sleep, wasting hours of production time. One night, Aykroyd found him crashing on the sofa of a nearby house, where Belushi had already helped himself to food in the refrigerator.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\" />\n\nCocaine was already so prevalent on the set (like many other film productions of that era) that Aykroyd, who used far less than his partner, claims a section of the budget was actually set aside for purchases of the drug during night shooting. The stars had a private bar, the Blues Club, built on the set, for themselves, crew, and friends. Carrie Fisher, Aykroyd's girlfriend at the time, said most of the bar's staff doubled as dealers, procuring any drug patrons desired.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\" />\n\nThe original budget was quickly surpassed, and back in Los Angeles, Wasserman grew increasingly frustrated. He was regularly confronting [[Ned Tanen]], the executive in charge of production for Universal, in person over the costs. [[Sean Daniel]], another studio executive, was not reassured when he came to Chicago and saw the production had set up a special facility for the 70 cars used in the chase sequences. Filming there, which was supposed to have concluded in the middle of September, continued into late October.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\" />\n\nOn the set, Belushi's drug use worsened. Fisher, who herself later struggled with cocaine addiction, said Landis told her to keep Belushi away from the drug. Wendell was hired to clear any from the places Belushi visited off-camera. Nevertheless, at one point, Landis found Belushi with what he described as a \"mountain\" of cocaine on a table in his trailer, which led to a tearful confrontation in which Belushi admitted his addiction and feared it could eventually kill him.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\" />\n\nAfter Belushi's wife Judy and Aykroyd had a talk with Belushi about his antics, the production returned to Los Angeles. Filming there again ran smoothly, until it came time to shoot the final sequence at the [[Hollywood Palladium]]. Just beforehand, Belushi fell off a borrowed skateboard and seriously injured his knee, making it unlikely he could go through with the scene, which required him to sing, dance, and do cartwheels. Wasserman persuaded the city's top [[orthopedic surgery|orthopedic surgeon]] to postpone his weekend plans long enough to stop by and sufficiently [[anesthetic|anesthetize]] Belushi's knee, and the scene was filmed as intended.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\" />\n\n====Locations====\nMuch of the film was shot on location in and around Chicago between July and October 1979, including [[Joliet Correctional Center]] in nearby [[Joliet, Illinois]] and [[Wauconda, Illinois]], where the car crashes into the side of Route 12.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web | title=Blues Brothers Central | work=The Blues Brothers : About The Movie | url=http://www.bluesbrotherscentral.com/movies/the-blues-brothers/ | accessdate=December 16, 2008}}</ref> Made with the cooperation of [[Mayor of Chicago|Mayor]] [[Jane Byrne|Jane M.

Cab Calloway initially wanted to do a disco variation on his signature tune, \"Minnie the Moocher\", having done the song in several styles in the past, but Landis insisted that the song be done faithful to the original big-band version.\n\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column    = Artist\n\n| title1          = [[She Caught the Katy]]\n| writer1         = [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], [[Yank Rachell]]\n| extra1          = The Blues Brothers with lead vocals by Jake Blues\n| length1         = 4:10\n\n| title2          = [[Peter Gunn (song)|Peter Gunn Theme]]\n| writer2         = [[Henry Mancini]]\n| extra2          = The Blues Brothers Band\n| length2         = 3:46\n\n| title3          = [[Gimme Some Lovin'#Blues Brothers cover|Gimme Some Lovin']]\n| writer3         = [[Steve Winwood]], [[Muff Winwood]], [[Spencer Davis]]\n| extra3          = The Blues Brothers with lead vocals by Jake Blues\n| length3         = 3:06\n\n| title4          = [[Shake a Tail Feather]]\n| writer4         = Otha Hayes, [[Andre Williams]], Verlie Rice\n| extra4          = Ray Charles with the Blues Brothers (Jake and Elwood, backing vocals)\n| length4         = 2:48\n\n| title5          = [[Everybody Needs Somebody to Love]]\n| writer5         = [[Jerry Wexler]], [[Bert Berns]], [[Solomon Burke]]\n| extra5          = The Blues Brothers (Jake Blues, lead vocals; Elwood Blues, harmonica and vocals)\n| length5         = 3:21\n\n| title6          = [[The Old Landmark]]\n| writer6         = Adeline M.

Even with many returning cast members, the film was considered a box-office failure, only generating a little over $14 million in sales, and critics' reactions were negative.<ref name=\"BOM2\">{{cite web|title=Blues Brothers 2000|work=Box Office Mojo| url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bluesbrothers2000.htm|accessdate=December 16, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Blues Brothers: Private]]''\n* ''[[The Blues Brothers (video game)|The Blues Brothers Video Game]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|The Blues Brothers}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.bluesbrothersofficialsite.com/}}\n* {{IMDb title|0080455|The Blues Brothers}}\n* {{Allmovie title}}\n* {{tcmdb title|19422|The Blues Brothers}}\n* {{AFI film|56373|The Blues Brothers}}\n* {{Mojo title|bluesbrothers|The Blues Brothers}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|blues_brothers|The Blues Brothers}}\n\n{{The Blues Brothers}}\n{{John Landis}}\n{{Saturday Night Live}}\n{{Good article}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blues Brothers}}\n[[Category:The Blues Brothers]]\n[[Category:1980 films]]\n[[Category:1980s action comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s buddy films]]\n[[Category:1980s chase films]]\n[[Category:1980s musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American action comedy films]]\n[[Category:American buddy films]]\n[[Category:American chase films]]\n[[Category:American musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:Blues films]]\n[[Category:Buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about brothers]]\n[[Category:Films about orphans]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Landis]]\n[[Category:Films set in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Films set in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Jukebox musical films]]\n[[Category:Films about Nazis]]\n[[Category:Saturday Night Live films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Dan Aykroyd]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by John Landis]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Nuns in fiction]]\n[[Category:Films produced by George Folsey Jr.]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|1980 musical comedy film directed by John Landis}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2016}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = The Blues Brothers\n| image          = Bluesbrothersmovieposter.jpg\n| border         = yes\n| alt            = Movie poster with two of the main characters on the right-side of the image: They are both wearing black suits, hats, and sunglasses and facing forward.

The film is set in and around [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], where it was filmed.  The film's screenplay was written by Aykroyd and Landis. It features musical numbers by [[rhythm and blues]] (R&B), [[Soul music|soul]], and [[blues]] singers [[James Brown]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Ray Charles]], and [[John Lee Hooker]]. It features non-musical supporting performances by [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Henry Gibson]], [[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]] and [[John Candy]].\n\nThe story is a tale of [[wikt:redeem|redemption]] for paroled convict Jake and his [[blood brother]] Elwood, who set out on \"a mission from God\" to save from foreclosure the Catholic orphanage in which they were raised. To do so, they must reunite their R&B band and organize a performance to earn $5,000 needed to pay the orphanage's [[property tax]] bill. Along the way, they are targeted by a homicidal \"mystery woman\", [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazis]], and a [[country music|country and western]] band\u2014all while being relentlessly pursued by the police.\n\n[[Universal Studios]], which had won the bidding war for the film, was hoping to take advantage of Belushi's popularity in the wake of ''Saturday Night Live'', ''[[Animal House]]'', and the Blues Brothers' musical success; it soon found itself unable to control production costs. The start of filming was delayed when Aykroyd, new to film screenwriting, took six months to deliver a long and unconventional script that Landis had to rewrite before production, which began without a final budget. On location in Chicago, Belushi's partying and drug use caused lengthy and costly delays that, along with the destructive car chases depicted onscreen, made the final film one of the most expensive comedies ever produced.\n\nConcerns that the film would fail limited its initial bookings to less than half those a film of its magnitude normally received. Released in the United States on June 20, 1980, it received mostly positive reviews. It earned just under $5 million in its opening weekend and went on to gross over $115 million in theaters worldwide before its release on home video. It has become a [[cult classic]], spawning the [[sequel]], ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'', 18 years later, which was a critical and commercial failure.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Blues]] vocalist and [[petty criminal]] \"Joliet\" Jake Blues is [[paroled]] on [[Good conduct time|good behavior]] grounds from [[Joliet Correctional Center]] after serving three years of a five-year sentence, and is picked up by his [[blood brother]] Elwood in his [[Bluesmobile]], a battered, decommissioned police car. Elwood demonstrates its capabilities by jumping an open [[drawbridge]]. The brothers visit the [[Roman Catholic]] [[orphanage]] where they were raised, and learn from Sister Mary \"the Penguin\" Stigmata and old friend Curtis that it will be closed unless $5,000 in [[property tax]]es is collected. Jake offers to steal the money, but Sister Mary is offended. During a sermon by the Reverend Cleophus James at the Triple Rock [[Missionary Baptist|Baptist]] Church, Jake has another idea: they can re-form their band, [[the Blues Brothers]], which disbanded while Jake was in prison, and raise the money to save the orphanage.\n\nThat night, state troopers attempt to arrest Elwood for driving with a suspended license. After a high-speed chase through the [[Dixie Square Mall]], the brothers flee to the [[flophouse]] where Elwood lives, miraculously escaping a [[rocket launcher]] attack by a mysterious woman. The next morning, as the police arrive at the house, the woman detonates a [[bomb]] that demolishes the building, but somehow leaves Jake and Elwood unharmed, and saves them from being apprehended.\n\nJake and Elwood begin tracking down members of the band. Five of them are playing a [[Holiday Inn]] lounge as \"Murph and the Magic Tones,\" and quickly agree to rejoin. The sixth member, \"[[Alan Rubin|Mr. Fabulous]]\", turns them down as he is the [[ma\u00eetre d']] at expensive restaurant \"Chez Paul\", but the brothers behave obnoxiously in the restaurant until he relents. On their way to meet the final two band members, the brothers find the road through [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]] blocked by an \"[[American Nazi Party|American Socialist White People's Party]]\"\u2014\"the Illinois Nazis\"\u2014demonstration on a bridge. It is mentioned that \"The Nazis\" won their court case, likely a reference to [[National_Socialist_Party_of_America_v._Village_of_Skokie | The Skokie Affair]]. Elwood runs them off the bridge, forcing them to jump into the East Lagoon. The commander orders a subordinate to record the car's license number. Meanwhile, the last two band members, [[Matt \"Guitar\" Murphy]] and [[Lou Marini|\"Blue Lou\" Marini]], who now work in a [[soul food]] restaurant, rejoin the band against the advice of Murphy's wife and restaurant owner, [[Aretha Franklin]]. The reunited group obtain instruments and equipment from Ray's Music Exchange in [[Calumet City]], and Ray, \"as usual\", takes an [[IOU]].\n\nAs Jake attempts to book a gig, the mystery woman blows up the phone booth he and Elwood are using; once again, they are miraculously unhurt. The band stumbles into a gig at Bob's Country Bunker, a local [[honky-tonk]]. They win over the rowdy crowd, but run up a bar tab higher than their pay, and infuriate the country band that was actually booked there, the Good Ole Boys.\n\n[[File:Rusty-s TV and Movie Car Museum Jackson TN 018.jpg|thumb|Reproduction of the \"Bluesmobile\". Rusty's TV & Movie Car Museum, Jackson, TN.]]\nRealizing that they need one big show to raise the necessary money, the brothers persuade their old agent to book the Palace Hotel Ballroom, north of Chicago. They mount a loudspeaker atop the Bluesmobile and drive the Chicago area promoting the concert, but in the process alert the police, the Nazis, and the Good Ole Boys of their whereabouts. The ballroom is packed with blues fans, cops, and the Good Ole Boys. Jake and Elwood perform two songs, then sneak offstage, as the tax deadline is rapidly approaching. A record company executive offers them a $10,000 cash advance on a recording contract\u2014more than enough to pay off the orphanage's taxes and Ray's IOU\u2014and then shows them how to slip out of the building unnoticed. As they make their escape via a service tunnel, they are confronted by the mystery woman: Jake's vengeful ex-[[fianc\u00e9e]]. After her volley of [[M16 rifle]] bullets leaves them miraculously unharmed, Jake offers a series of ridiculous excuses that she accepts, allowing the brothers to escape to the Bluesmobile.\n\nJake and Elwood race back toward Chicago with dozens of state/local police and the Good Ole Boys in pursuit. They eventually elude them all with a series of improbable maneuvers, including a miraculous gravity-defying escape from the Illinois Nazis. At the [[Richard J. Daley Center]], they rush inside the adjacent [[Chicago City Hall]] building, soon followed by hundreds of police, state troopers, SWAT teams, firefighters, Illinois National Guardsmen, and the Military Police. Finding the office of the [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] Assessor (played by [[Steven Spielberg]]), the brothers pay the tax bill. Just as their receipt is stamped, they are arrested by the mob of law officers.

The name \"The Blues Brothers\" was the idea of [[Howard Shore]]. The fictional back story and character sketches of blood brothers Jake and Elwood were developed by Aykroyd in collaboration with Ron Gwynne, who is credited as a story consultant for the film. As related in the liner notes of the band's debut album, ''[[Briefcase Full of Blues]]'', the brothers grew up in an orphanage, learned the blues from a janitor named Curtis, and sealed their brotherhood by cutting their middle fingers with a steel string said to have come from the guitar of [[Elmore James]].<ref name=\"Bio\">{{cite web | title=Fortune City-Blues Brothers | work=Biography of the Blues Brothers-From their album, A Briefcase Full of Blues | url=http://www.fortunecity.com/tinpan/fitzgerald/12/bio.html|accessdate=December 16, 2008}}</ref>\n\nBelushi had become a star in 1978 as a result of both the Blues Brothers' musical success and his role in ''National Lampoon's Animal House''. At one point, he managed the triple feat of being the star of the week's top-grossing film, top-rated television show, and singing on the number-one album within a year. When Aykroyd and Belushi decided they could make a Blues Brothers film, the bidding war was intense. [[Universal Studios]] narrowly beat [[Paramount Pictures]] for the project. John Landis, who had directed Belushi in ''Animal House'', was aboard as director.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\">{{cite news|last=Zeman|first=Ned|title=Soul Men: The Making of The Blues Brothers|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/01/making-of-blues-brothers-budget-for-cocaine|newspaper=Vanity Fair|date=January 2013|accessdate=December 18, 2012}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the project had neither a budget nor a script. On the former issue, Universal head [[Lew Wasserman]] thought the film could be made for $12 million; the filmmakers wanted $20 million. It would be impossible to settle on a specific amount without a screenplay to review, and after [[Mitch Glazer]] declined to help him, Aykroyd wrote one on his own.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\" />\n\nAykroyd had never written a screenplay before, as he admitted in the 1998 documentary, ''Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers'', or even read one, and he was unable to find a writing partner. Consequently, he put together a very descriptive volume that explained the characters' origins and how the band members were recruited.

This caused friction between Landis and Universal later in the production, as its costs far exceeded the original budget. Since none of them except Charles had had any hits in recent years, the studio wanted the director to replace them with \u2013 or add performances by \u2013 younger acts, such as [[Rose Royce]], whose \"[[Car Wash (song)|Car Wash]]\" had made them disco stars after its use in [[Car Wash (film)|the 1976 film of that name]].<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\"/>\n\nOther musicians in the cast include [[Big Walter Horton]], [[Pinetop Perkins]], and [[John Lee Hooker]] (who performed \"Boom Boom\" during the Maxwell Street scene). The members of The Blues Brothers Band were themselves notable. Steve Cropper and Donald Dunn are architects of the [[Stax Records]] sound (Cropper's guitar can be heard at the start of the [[Sam & Dave]] song \"[[Soul Man (song)|Soul Man]]\") and were half of [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]]. Horn players Lou Marini, Tom Malone, and Alan Rubin had all played in [[Blood, Sweat & Tears]] and the ''Saturday Night Live'' band. Drummer Willie Hall had played in [[The Bar-Kays]] and backed [[Isaac Hayes]]. Matt Murphy is a veteran blues guitarist. As the band developed at ''Saturday Night Live'', pianist [[Paul Shaffer]] was part of the act and was cast in the film. However, due to contractual obligations with ''SNL'', he was unable to participate, so actor-musician Murphy Dunne (whose father, [[George Dunne]], was the Cook County Board President) was hired to take his role.<ref name=\"DVD doc\"/>\n\nFisher, Freeman, Gibson, and Candy were cast in non-musical supporting roles. The film is also notable for the number of cameo appearances by established celebrities and entertainment-industry figures, including Steve Lawrence as a booking agent, Twiggy as a \"chic lady\" in a [[Jaguar E-Type|Jaguar convertible]] whom Elwood propositions at a gas station, [[Steven Spielberg]] as the Cook County Assessor's clerk, John Landis as a state trooper in the mall chase, Paul Reubens (before [[Pee-wee Herman]]) as a waiter in the Chez Paul restaurant scene, [[Joe Walsh]] in a cameo as the first prisoner to jump up on a table in the final scene, and [[Chaka Khan]] as the soloist in the Triple Rock choir. [[The Muppets|Muppet]] puppeteer [[Frank Oz]] plays a [[Prison officer|corrections officer]], and in the scene where the brothers crash into [[Toys R Us]], a [[Grover]] and [[Kermit the Frog]] toy can be spotted and a customer (played by stunt coordinator [[Gary McLarty]]) asks the cashier if they have a [[Miss Piggy]] doll, a Muppet character that is voiced by Oz. Singer/songwriter [[Stephen Bishop (singer)|Stephen Bishop]] is a deputy sheriff who complains that Jake and Elwood broke his watch (a result of the car chase in the mall). Makeup artist [[Layne Britton]] is the old card player who asks Elwood, \"Did you get me my Cheez Whiz, boy?\" The character portrayed by Cab Calloway is named Curtis as homage to [[Curtis Salgado]], a [[Portland, Oregon]], blues musician who inspired Belushi while he was in Oregon filming ''Animal House''.<ref name=\"CS\">{{cite web|title=Biography|work=Curtis Salgado|url=http://www.curtissalgado.com/biography.html|accessdate=December 16, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017164459/http://www.curtissalgado.com/biography.html <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=October 17, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOver 500 extras were used for the next-to-last scene, the blockade of the building at [[Daley Center]], including 200 National Guardsmen, 100 state and city police officers, with 15 horses for the [[mounted police]] (and three each [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tanks]], [[helicopter]]s, and [[Fire apparatus|fire engines]]).<ref name=\"HappyRam\"/><ref name=\"Chicago Sun-Times3\">{{cite news|title=Blues Brothers 25th Anniversary|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]| url=http://www.suntimes.com/special_sections/bluebros/| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050721084943/http://www.suntimes.com/special_sections/bluebros/| archivedate=July 21, 2005|accessdate=December 16, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began in July 1979, with the film's budget still not settled. For the first month, things ran smoothly on and off the set. When Weiss saw the supposedly final $17.5 million budget, he reportedly joked, \"I think we've spent that much already.\"<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\" />\n\nIn the next month, the production began falling behind schedule. Much of the delay was due to Belushi's partying and carousing. When not on the set, he went out to his familiar Chicago haunts such as [[Wrigley Field]] and the [[Old Town Ale House, Chicago|Old Town Ale House]]. People often recognized him and slipped him cocaine, a drug he was already using heavily on his own, hoping to use it with him. \"Every blue-collar Joe wants his John Belushi story\", said Smokey Wendell, who was eventually hired to keep it away from the star. As a result of his late nights and drug and alcohol use, Belushi would often miss unit calls (the beginning of a production day) or go to his trailer after them and sleep, wasting hours of production time. One night, Aykroyd found him crashing on the sofa of a nearby house, where Belushi had already helped himself to food in the refrigerator.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\" />\n\nCocaine was already so prevalent on the set (like many other film productions of that era) that Aykroyd, who used far less than his partner, claims a section of the budget was actually set aside for purchases of the drug during night shooting. The stars had a private bar, the Blues Club, built on the set, for themselves, crew, and friends. Carrie Fisher, Aykroyd's girlfriend at the time, said most of the bar's staff doubled as dealers, procuring any drug patrons desired.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\" />\n\nThe original budget was quickly surpassed, and back in Los Angeles, Wasserman grew increasingly frustrated. He was regularly confronting [[Ned Tanen]], the executive in charge of production for Universal, in person over the costs. [[Sean Daniel]], another studio executive, was not reassured when he came to Chicago and saw the production had set up a special facility for the 70 cars used in the chase sequences. Filming there, which was supposed to have concluded in the middle of September, continued into late October.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\" />\n\nOn the set, Belushi's drug use worsened. Fisher, who herself later struggled with cocaine addiction, said Landis told her to keep Belushi away from the drug. Wendell was hired to clear any from the places Belushi visited off-camera. Nevertheless, at one point, Landis found Belushi with what he described as a \"mountain\" of cocaine on a table in his trailer, which led to a tearful confrontation in which Belushi admitted his addiction and feared it could eventually kill him.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\" />\n\nAfter Belushi's wife Judy and Aykroyd had a talk with Belushi about his antics, the production returned to Los Angeles. Filming there again ran smoothly, until it came time to shoot the final sequence at the [[Hollywood Palladium]]. Just beforehand, Belushi fell off a borrowed skateboard and seriously injured his knee, making it unlikely he could go through with the scene, which required him to sing, dance, and do cartwheels. Wasserman persuaded the city's top [[orthopedic surgery|orthopedic surgeon]] to postpone his weekend plans long enough to stop by and sufficiently [[anesthetic|anesthetize]] Belushi's knee, and the scene was filmed as intended.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\" />\n\n====Locations====\nMuch of the film was shot on location in and around Chicago between July and October 1979, including [[Joliet Correctional Center]] in nearby [[Joliet, Illinois]] and [[Wauconda, Illinois]], where the car crashes into the side of Route 12.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web | title=Blues Brothers Central | work=The Blues Brothers : About The Movie | url=http://www.bluesbrotherscentral.com/movies/the-blues-brothers/ | accessdate=December 16, 2008}}</ref> Made with the cooperation of [[Mayor of Chicago|Mayor]] [[Jane Byrne|Jane M.

Franklin required several takes, and Brown simply rerecorded his performance live. Cab Calloway initially wanted to do a disco variation on his signature tune, \"Minnie the Moocher\", having done the song in several styles in the past, but Landis insisted that the song be done faithful to the original big-band version.\n\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column    = Artist\n\n| title1          = [[She Caught the Katy]]\n| writer1         = [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], [[Yank Rachell]]\n| extra1          = The Blues Brothers with lead vocals by Jake Blues\n| length1         = 4:10\n\n| title2          = [[Peter Gunn (song)|Peter Gunn Theme]]\n| writer2         = [[Henry Mancini]]\n| extra2          = The Blues Brothers Band\n| length2         = 3:46\n\n| title3          = [[Gimme Some Lovin'#Blues Brothers cover|Gimme Some Lovin']]\n| writer3         = [[Steve Winwood]], [[Muff Winwood]], [[Spencer Davis]]\n| extra3          = The Blues Brothers with lead vocals by Jake Blues\n| length3         = 3:06\n\n| title4          = [[Shake a Tail Feather]]\n| writer4         = Otha Hayes, [[Andre Williams]], Verlie Rice\n| extra4          = Ray Charles with the Blues Brothers (Jake and Elwood, backing vocals)\n| length4         = 2:48\n\n| title5          = [[Everybody Needs Somebody to Love]]\n| writer5         = [[Jerry Wexler]], [[Bert Berns]], [[Solomon Burke]]\n| extra5          = The Blues Brothers (Jake Blues, lead vocals; Elwood Blues, harmonica and vocals)\n| length5         = 3:21\n\n| title6          = [[The Old Landmark]]\n| writer6         = Adeline M.

It has a population of 35,000, most of whom speak [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. It was formerly a [[French India|French colony]] for nearly 200 years, and, though united with India in 1954, is still sometimes known as \"French Yanam\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=More|first1=J. B.

During [[French India|French rule]], the Tuesday market (''Mardi du Santa'' or ''Mangalavaram Santa'') at Yanam was popular among the [[Telugu people]] in the [[Madras Presidency]], who visited Yanam to buy foreign and smuggled goods during Yanam People's Festival held in January. After implementation of the [[Child Marriage Restraint Act|Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929]] in [[British India]], Telugu people often traveled to Yanam to conduct [[child marriage]]s, which remained legal under the French administration. \n\n==History==\n[[File:Yanaon.jpg|thumb|Colonial Yanaon]]\n{{Main|Yanaon (Inde fran\u00e7aise)}}\nYanaon was a [[Dutch India|Dutch colony]] prior to French takeover in the 1720s. Indigo wells (''Neelikundilu'') are still found in the west of Yanam. The Dutch built a fort, which they used to store their currency, [[Mint (coin)|minted]] at nearby Neelapalli. The location of the fort is today referred to by locals as the ''Saali Kota'' or ''Saalivandru'', meaning \"shawl-hut\", since after the demise of the Dutch, the building was taken over by cloth weavers.\n\nThe region was presented to a French General, the [[Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau|Marquess of Bussy]], by the king of Vizianagaram as a token of gratitude for Bussy's help in his fight against the rulers of [[Bobbili]]. There remains a street named after Bussy in Yanam.\n[[File:French India 1741-1754.png|thumb|French India]]\n\n===Commercial era, before 1742===\nThe book ''The Botanic Garden of Yanam'' (''Le Jardin Botanique de Yanaon''), by M\u00e9decin-colonel Alfred-Alphonse-L\u00e9on Bigot, states that the [[Compagnie des Indes Orientales|Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise des Indes Orientales]] established a [[trading post]] at Yanaon in 1723, making it the third [[French colonial empire|French colony]] established in India (though not officially confirmed as such until 1751).\n\nThe area was given up in 1727, after commercial operations proved unsuccessful, but was seized again by Governor-General [[Joseph Fran\u00e7ois Dupleix|Dupleix]] in 1731. A ''[[firman (decree)|firman]]'' from [[Haji Hassan Khan]], [[Nawab of Masulipatam]], authorised the French Representative Fouquet, then chief of the Company at [[Masulipatam]], to set up a ''lodge'' (small business concession) signed by the Governor of Rajahmundry and its Southern Circars, and Nawab Roustoum Khan ([[Haji Hassan Khan|Haji Hussain]]) granted a ''Paravana'' dated 1735 for French commerce in Yanam.\n\n===Political era, after 1742===\nYanoan was re-established in 1742, during the reign of Mughal emperor [[Muhammad Shah]], at which time political motives began to overshadow commercial development. The annual rent was waived by a document in 1743, and in 1747 the French administrator, Monsieur [[Sinfray]], induced Mir Ahmad Ali Khan, [[Nawab of Arcot]], to grant the French all rights to the lands situated around their quarters at Yanam.\n\nIn December 1753, a Paravana of [[Salabat Jang]] conceded to [[Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau|Bussy]] the [[Northern Circars]]. Salabat Jang was indebted  to the [[French East India Company]] for his elevation to the throne, which had been confirmed by the Mughal emperor. The agreement made between the French and Salabat Jang in [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] bears the signature of Said Loukshur, Minister of Salabat Jang. Yanam acquired considerable importance during the French occupation of the Northern Circars.\n\n===First British occupation===\nAnother important event in the history was the war between the French and the British fought at Chandurthi in 1758 in which the French were defeated. Salabat Jang made a treaty with the British and gave the Northern Circars under a ''firman'' to the British. After 1760 the French lost hold in [[South India]], especially on Northern Circars.\n\nA document dated 15 May 1765 showed that the villages of Yanam and Kapulapalem (Capouloupal\u00e9m) with other lands were handed over by Jean White Hill and George Dolben, the British representatives deputed by Jean Pybus, the head of the British settlement in [[Masulipatam]] to Yoan Yacques Panon, French [[Commissioner]] deputed by [[Jean Law de Lauriston]] the then [[Governor General]] of [[Puducherry]], for taking them over. This document mentions that France entered into possession of Yanam and its dependent territories with exemption from all export and import duties. Soon after taking possession of this settlement, Panon obtained a ''firman'' for full liberty of trade and commerce of the French in Yanam.\n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box | before= [[French East India Company]]| title=First British Occupation of [[Yanam, French India|Yanaon]]<br />([[Seven Years' War]]) | after=[[French East India Company]] | years=1758\u20131765}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n===Second British occupation===\nBetween 1778 and 1783, Puducherry was under British occupation. Yanam was restored again to the French in 1785. Mallhendre took possession of it and Bluter succeeded him. After Bluter, [[Pierre Sonnerat]] (18 August 1748 \u2013 31 March 1814) became the chief in 1790 in Yanam. He appreciated very much the sonority and the music of the Telugu language. He administered Yanam during the time of the [[French Revolution]].\n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box | before= [[French East India Company]]| title=Second British Occupation of [[Yanam, French India|Yanaon]] | after=[[French Colonial Empire]] | years=1778\u20131785}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n===Third British occupation===\nOnce again French lost control over Yanam to the British. During 1793 and 1816 Puducherry was under British control. So, Yanam fell thrice into the hands of the British. After the [[Napoleonic wars]], by the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)]] Yanam along with the factory at [[Machilipatnam]] was finally returned to the French on 26 September 1816. From then it was continuously under French control until its transfer to India in 1954.\n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box | before= [[French Colonial Empire]]| title=Final British Occupation of [[Yanam, French India|Yanaon]] <br />([[Napoleonic Wars]])| after=[[French Colonial Empire]] | years=1793\u20131816}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n==Local administration in the colonial era==\n[[File:Yanam Venkanna Babu Ratham.jpg|thumb|Venkanna Babu Ratham, Yanam]]\n\n===1840 decree===\n[[Local administration]] was started in Yanaon by a [[royal decree]] (''Ordonnance Royale'') dated 23 July 1840 during [[July Monarchy]]. According to that decree Yanaon and [[Mah\u00e9, India|Mah\u00e9]] were provided with ''Chef de service'' (Service Chief) who resides in his official residence. After the merger, it is being resided by Regional Executive Officer, Yanam.<ref>''La Gazette de l'Etat de Pondich\u00e9ry'' (''Gazette of Puducherry'')</ref>\n\n===1871 decree===\nAccording to a decree dated 1 February 1871, one person can be sent as a ''[[Legislator|d\u00e9put\u00e9]]'' to the [[Chamber of Deputies of France|Chamber of Deputies]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''La Gazette de l'Etat de Pondich\u00e9ry''</ref>\n\n===1872 decree===\nAnother pivotal incident in local administration was the decree of 1872. It was dated 13 June 1872 and was issued during [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. According to that decree ''Conseils locaux'' (Local councils) were created at each colony. The elected member was called as ''Conseiller local'' (Local councillor). Conseil local de Yanaon had a strength of 4 local councillors. The term of office was 6 years with one half of membership renewed every 3 years.<ref>''La Gazette de I'Etat de Pondich\u00e9ry''</ref>  The powers of the local councils are purely advisory. These assemblies give their opinion on the local budget project concerning the establishments to which it belongs and on all the matters of the competence of the general council.\n[[File:Yanam Ferry Road.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Ferry Road, Yanam]]\n[[File:Bus station complex at Yanam.JPG|right|250px|thumb|Rajiv Gandhi Bus station complex at Yanam]]\n\n===1878 decree===\nAccording to a decree dated 24 February 1878, one person could be sent as a [[senator|''s\u00e9nateur'']] to  the  French Senate ''([[S\u00e9nat]])''. Senators would be elected by ''Conseil colonial'' (Colonial Council) and ''Conseil local'' (Local council). First election were held on 26 March 1876.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n===1946 decree===\nBy the decree of 1946, [[French India]] (Inde fran\u00e7aise) became an ([[Territoire d'outre-mer|Overseas Territory]]) of France. Then an ''Assembl\u00e9e Repr\u00e9sentative'' (Representative Assembly) was created for each colony. Yanaon was provided with two assembly representatives (Equivalent to [[Member of Legislative Assembly|MLA]]). Currently Yanaon is holding one assembly representative.\n\nNotable assembly representatives from Yanam were [[Kamichetty Venougopala Rao Naidou]], Kamichetty Savithiry, [[Kamichetty Sri Parassourama Varaprassada Rao Naidu]] and Kanakala Tatayya Naidou.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n==Municipal administration in the colonial era==\n{{Main|Municipal Administration in French India}}\n\nThough the French established colonies in India in the seventeenth century itself, it was not until the end of the 19th century that they started civil administration in [[French India]].\n\n===French Metropolitan decree===\nA French Metropolitan decree, dated 12 March 1880 adopted a six-year term of office for mayors (''Maire''), municipal councillors (''Conseil municipaux'') and commune [[panchayat]]s (''[[commune (France)|communes]]''). Thus French India has seen a French system of municipal administration. In the past, municipal administration was virtually the pivot of the whole administrative machinery in French India. It had several features that could serve as a role model for hassle-free administration.\n\nThen a total of 10 communes were formed in which Yanaon became one commune with a strength of 12 Municipal Councillors (''conseillers municipaux''). The first elections were held on 30 May 1880.\n\n===Structure of the municipality===\n[[File:Yanam Draksharamam Road.jpg|thumb|Draksharamam Road]]\n{{See also|Yanam Municipality}}\n''La Mairie'' ([[Town Hall]]) in Yanaon is now called as Municipality Building. It was built in 19th century and is situated next to ''Court House'' in the Thiagaraja Street in Yanaon Town. During French colonial rule, [[Yanam Municipality]] had 12 ''Si\u00e8ges''. Then, they were called previously as ''Si\u00e8ge''s instead of [[ward (politics)|wards]]. Each ward is represented by a municipal councillor. Each ''commune'' possesses a mayor and a [[municipal council]] (Conseil Municipal) that manage the ''commune'' from the ''Mairie''. The life-span of a municipal council will be six years, with one half of the membership renewed every three years.\n\n===Election results of 1948===\n[[File:Children's Park in Yanam.jpg|thumb|Children's Park]]\nElections held on 24 October 1948 and 18 October 1954 are most crucial in the history of French India. In June 1948 the French and Indian Governments came to an agreement as to how the future of the French Settlements should be determined.<ref>Future of French India, by Russel H. Fifield</ref>\n\nMunicipal elections were held in [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]], [[Karikal]] and Yanam on 24 October 1948. The two main parties were the French India Socialist Party (Socialists), who favoured the continuance of French rule, and the French India Congress ([[Indian National Congress|Congress]]), who favoured union with India. Socialist Party was headed by [[Kamichetty Sri Parassourama Varaprassada Rao Naidu]] and Congress Party was headed by Yerra Jaganatha Rao.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n*'''Yanam''' \u2013 12\n**'''Socialists''' \u2013 03\n**'''[[Independent (politician)|Independents]]''' \u2013 09\n\n==Cession of Yanam==\n{{Main|Coup d'\u00c9tat de Yanaon}}\nDue to nationalist struggle by some leaders, conditions became intolerable in Yanam after its mayor and other representatives of Yanam adopted the merger resolution. The Mayor Madimchetty Satianandam, deputy mayor, and over 200 people took refuge in the adjacent areas of the [[Indian Union]]. Then 78-year-old [[Samatam Krouschnaya]] became acting mayor of Yanam. On Sunday 13 June 1954, Indian police came into action. They along with the pro-merger leaders hired hoodlums from Yanam assaulted refugees on Indian soil. It was then that the refugees marched into Yanam under the leadership of [[Dadala Raphael Ramanayya]] and aided by then Maire De Yanaon, Monsieur Madimchetty Satianarayanamourty alias Satia and took over the administration. After hoisting the [[Indian Flag|Indian National Flag]], they formed the revolutionary [[provisional government]] of Yanam headed by [[Dadala Raphael Ramanayya]] and adopted a resolution declaring \"Yanaon lib\u00e9r\u00e9\" (Yanam liberated). The coup d'\u00e9tat of Yanam was announced by [[All India Radio]] and Press.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">\"My Struggle for freedom of French Provinces in India\" autobiography written by Sri Dadala Raphael Ramanayya</ref>\n{{s-start}}\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n{{s-bef | rows=3 | before=[[French Colonial Empire]]}}\n{{s-ttl | title=[[Yanam, French India|\u00c9tablissement fran\u00e7ais de Yanaon]]<br />(de facto not recognised by France) | years=1815\u201313 June 1954}}\n{{s-aft | after=[[Provisional Government]] of Yanam}}\n|-\n{{s-ttl | title=[[Yanam, French India|\u00c9tablissement fran\u00e7ais de Yanaon]]<br />(de facto) | years=1815\u20131 November 1954}}\n{{s-aft | after=India}}\n|-\n{{s-ttl | title=[[Yanam, French India|\u00c9tablissement fran\u00e7ais de Yanaon]]<br />([[de jure]]) | years=1815\u201316 August 1962}}\n{{s-aft | after=India}}\n{{s-end}}\nAfter the coup d'\u00e9tat, the last administrator of Yanam, George Sala was recalled by [[Andr\u00e9 M\u00e9nard]], then [[Governor General]] of Puducherry in June 1954.\n\n==Aftermath of liberation==\nThe Yanam coup d'\u00e9tat had enraged the French authorities of Puducherry. Rumours were spread to the effect that the French government were despatching a [[cruiser]] to Yanam to capture Merger leaders and to re-establish their authority. After the coup, the last [[Administration (government)|administrator]] of Yanam, George Sala was recalled by [[Andr\u00e9 M\u00e9nard]], then Governor General of [[Puducherry]] in June 1954.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n[[Dadala]] was also appointed as Acting Commissioner for Yanam for 14 days. Towards the end of June 1954, [[Kewal Singh]] paid a visit to Yanam and requested Dadala's return to Pondicherry to continue his activities there. On 3 July, on Kewal Singh's request, Dadala left Yanam, after making all arrangements for its proper administration.\n\n===De facto transfer===\nYanam remained under French control till 13 June 1954, when it joined the Republic of India by Indian military action. On 1 November 1954, after long years of freedom struggle the ''de facto transfer'' (V\u0101stavik\u0101ntara\u1e47a) of the four enclaves of [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]], Yanam, [[Mah\u00e9, India|Mah\u00e9]], and [[Karikal]] to the [[Indian Union]] was achieved.\n\nThe Prime Minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], visited Puducherry on 16 January 1955. Messrs [[Edouard Goubert]], S. Perumal, Dadala and Sri Pakirisamy Pillai presented addresses to Pandit Nehru in a public meeting in the maidan of Gorimedu.\n\n===Treaty of cession===\nA treaty of cession was signed by the two countries on 28 May 1956.<ref name=\"Trait\u00e9 de Cession, 1956\">Trait\u00e9 de Cession, 1956</ref> The ''[[de jure]]'' transfer was delayed until the end of the [[Algerian War]].

It is [[Soil color|grey black]] and clay-like in composition. A few thin layers of sandy [[clay]] or [[sand]] approximating 0.3 metres in thickness, are intercalated with the clay soil. The river sand on the bank of Gauthami, Godavari consist of [[quartz]], [[felspar]] and [[mica]], with [[monazite]] found in the black streaks. There are no minerals of economic value in the region.\n\n===Irrigation===\n[[File:Sri Potti Sri Ramulu Yanam Bridge.jpg|thumb|Sri Potti Sreeramulu Yanam Bridge]]\nYanam receives irrigation water via the Bank Canal, which begins at the [[Dowleswaram]] headworks  of Sir [[Arthur Cotton]]'s [[barrage (dam)|barrage]] on the River [[Godavari River|Godavari]], downstream from [[Rajahmundry]]. The canal runs towards east to Pillanka, a village near Yanam, and is popularly known as ''French Channel'', having been built under a 1949 agreement between the then [[French Government]] and the [[Government of India]]. It provides irrigation and drinking water to the areas west of the Coringa River.\n\nAfter its merger with the [[Republic of India]], irrigation was provided to about 5.6&nbsp;km\u00b2 of dry land on the eastern side of the Coringa River by constructing an irrigation canal, the ''Adivipolam Channel'', from the tail end of Tallarevu South Canal and the starting point of the Neelapalli Channel on the right side. The work was undertaken by the Andhra Pradesh Public Works Department in 1964, and was completed and commissioned in June 1966. Like the French Channel, it provides irrigation and drinking water.\n[[File:Ferry of Yanam.jpg|thumb|Rajiv Gandhi Beach]]\n\n==Climate==\nYanam's climate is characterised by high humidity (over 70% in the day and 60% in the evenings throughout the year), a hot summer season (with humidity of 68 to 80%), and plentiful rainfall. It enjoys the benefits of both the [[Climate of India#Monsoon|Southwest]] and [[Climate of India#Monsoon|Northeast]] monsoons. Average annual rainfall is  1226&nbsp;mm.\n\n===Temperature===\n\nTemperatures in Yanam range from 27&nbsp;\u00b0C to 45&nbsp;\u00b0C in summer, and 17&nbsp;\u00b0C to 28&nbsp;\u00b0C in winter. From February, temperatures start rising rapidly until May, which is the hottest month, with the mean maximum around 37&nbsp;\u00b0C and mean minimum around 28&nbsp;\u00b0C.  Humidity being high, the heat is exhausting. The maximum temperature on some days in May or early June, before the onset of the south-west monsoon, may touch 47&nbsp;\u00b0C. The sea breeze affords some relief in the afternoons.\n\nSimilarly, pre-[[monsoon]] thunder-showers may also bring relief on some days. With the onset of the monsoon in June the temperature falls rapidly, and usually remains steady until September. In this season the mean maximum temperature is around 32&nbsp;\u00b0C, and night temperatures fall rapidly until December or January, when day temperatures are around 27&nbsp;\u00b0C, and night temperatures around 19&nbsp;\u00b0C. At times the minimum temperature may drop to 14&nbsp;\u00b0C. December and January are the coolest months.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n| 1843 | 4,000\n| 1882 | 4,536\n| 1884 | 4,552\n| 1885 | 4,266\n| 1900 | 5,005\n| 1901 | 4,681\n| 1911 | 4,727\n| 1926 | 4,995\n| 1931 | 5,249\n| 1936 | 5,220\n| 1941 | 5,711\n| 1948 | 5,853\n| 1971 | 8,291\n| 1981 | 11,631\n| 1991 | 20,297<ref>Manorama Year Book (1993), pp20</ref>\n| 2001 | 25,511\n| 2011 | 31,500\n| 2014 | 35,000\n}}\n{{As of|2001}} India census,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archivedate=2004-06-16|title= Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns  (Provisional)|accessdate=2008-11-01|publisher= Census Commission of India}}</ref> Yanam had a population of 31,362.

French law made it easy for thousands of ''colons'', ethnic or national French from former colonies of North and East Africa, India and [[Indochina]] to live in mainland France. \n\nIn Yanam, some 10,000 people chose French nationality. According to some estimates, nearly 120 to 150 [[Telugu people|Telugu]] families from former French India live in France. On the other hand, there are some French nationals living in Yanam and enjoying French pension (In [[Telugu language|Telugu]], ''Guddi Pinchanu'').\n\nThe ''Yanam French Peoples Association'' was formed and its president is Penupothu Suryanarayan. As of the 2000s, around 80 French nationals live in Yanam.\n\n==Court House (Palais de justice)==\nThe Court building is situated in an ancient white monument building of French architecture. It is called the ''Palais de justice'' ('''[[Court House]]''') and located at Thiagaraja Street, Yanam to the next of Municipality building.  The building has two floors - the ground floor is the court and the first floor is the residential quarters of the judge.  The building was renovated in 1967 and inaugurated by Thiru [[S.L. Silam]], the then [[Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry]].\n\n===Dutch India===\nYanam Judicial Magistrate Court is an ancient court formed prior to the French domain i.e. before 1725 while Yanam was as a [[Dutch India|Dutch colony]].  The Judicial Magistrate Court was existing then.\n\nSubsequently while this area came under the French on the reorganisation of French domain in 1725 the same court has been converted as French Court under French Law as a Judicial Court.  Both civil and criminal cases tried there.\n\n===After independence===\nAfter independence, the court was converted as an Indian Court as a Judicial Magistrate Court, Yanam in 1956, whereas, the Regional Administrative Officer of Yanam was the judge of the court having both executive and judicial powers on civil and criminal cases.\n\nAfter bifurcation of the judiciary, the court came under a separate Judicial Department of Government of Puducherry and under the administration of the [[Madras High Court|High Court]], [[Madras]] and it was termed as Judicial First Class Magistrate Court cum District Munsif Court. Subsequently under the reform by theHigh Court, Madras, the Yanam was upgraded to that of Subordinate Judge (Civil Judge-Senior Division)/Assistant Sessions Judge cum Judicial Magistrate of I Class in 2000.  Now because of this upgrade, all the civil cases up to the pecuniary jurisdiction of Rs. 500,000s are triable by the court.

He was killed at the age of 78 by [[Indian military]] while Yanam being seized during [[Coup d'\u00c9tat de Yanaon]].\n\nA prominent leader who was instrumental in the merger of Yanam into the Indian Union was [[Dadala Rafael Ramanayya]].

The mosque caters to the people of nearby villages like Thallarevu, Kolanka, Sunkarapalem. which are in the adjacent state of [[Andhra Pradesh]].\n\n===Catholic church===\n[[File:Government Road, Yanam.jpg|thumb|Church, Yanam]]\nThe monument in remembrance of the Catholic French rulers is linked with the church named ''St. Ann's Catholic Church''. Built in the European style, the furniture and decoration articles were imported from France.  The church was built in 1846 by French missionaries. The foundation stone was laid down by Father Michel Lecnam who he died on 30 April 1836 before completion of the church work. In his remembrance, a [[culvert]] was fixed in the church. The church work was completed in 1846.\n\n== Sports ==\n[[YSR Indoor Stadium]] is an indoor stadium in the city which has hosted matches of Junior National Badminton Championships, South Zone basketball championships as well as few volleyball and basketball matches.

It has a population of 35,000, most of whom speak [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. It was formerly a [[French India|French colony]] for nearly 200 years, and, though united with India in 1954, is still sometimes known as \"French Yanam\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=More|first1=J. B.

During [[French India|French rule]], the Tuesday market (''Mardi du Santa'' or ''Mangalavaram Santa'') at Yanam was popular among the [[Telugu people]] in the [[Madras Presidency]], who visited Yanam to buy foreign and smuggled goods during Yanam People's Festival held in January. After implementation of the [[Child Marriage Restraint Act|Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929]] in [[British India]], Telugu people often traveled to Yanam to conduct [[child marriage]]s, which remained legal under the French administration. \n\n==History==\n[[File:Yanaon.jpg|thumb|Colonial Yanaon]]\n{{Main|Yanaon (Inde fran\u00e7aise)}}\nYanaon was a [[Dutch India|Dutch colony]] prior to French takeover in the 1720s. Indigo wells (''Neelikundilu'') are still found in the west of Yanam. The Dutch built a fort, which they used to store their currency, [[Mint (coin)|minted]] at nearby Neelapalli. The location of the fort is today referred to by locals as the ''Saali Kota'' or ''Saalivandru'', meaning \"shawl-hut\", since after the demise of the Dutch, the building was taken over by cloth weavers.\n\nThe region was presented to a French General, the [[Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau|Marquess of Bussy]], by the king of Vizianagaram as a token of gratitude for Bussy's help in his fight against the rulers of [[Bobbili]]. There remains a street named after Bussy in Yanam.\n[[File:French India 1741-1754.png|thumb|French India]]\n\n===Commercial era, before 1742===\nThe book ''The Botanic Garden of Yanam'' (''Le Jardin Botanique de Yanaon''), by M\u00e9decin-colonel Alfred-Alphonse-L\u00e9on Bigot, states that the [[Compagnie des Indes Orientales|Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise des Indes Orientales]] established a [[trading post]] at Yanaon in 1723, making it the third [[French colonial empire|French colony]] established in India (though not officially confirmed as such until 1751).\n\nThe area was given up in 1727, after commercial operations proved unsuccessful, but was seized again by Governor-General [[Joseph Fran\u00e7ois Dupleix|Dupleix]] in 1731. A ''[[firman (decree)|firman]]'' from [[Haji Hassan Khan]], [[Nawab of Masulipatam]], authorised the French Representative Fouquet, then chief of the Company at [[Masulipatam]], to set up a ''lodge'' (small business concession) signed by the Governor of Rajahmundry and its Southern Circars, and Nawab Roustoum Khan ([[Haji Hassan Khan|Haji Hussain]]) granted a ''Paravana'' dated 1735 for French commerce in Yanam.\n\n===Political era, after 1742===\nYanoan was re-established in 1742, during the reign of Mughal emperor [[Muhammad Shah]], at which time political motives began to overshadow commercial development. The annual rent was waived by a document in 1743, and in 1747 the French administrator, Monsieur [[Sinfray]], induced Mir Ahmad Ali Khan, [[Nawab of Arcot]], to grant the French all rights to the lands situated around their quarters at Yanam.\n\nIn December 1753, a Paravana of [[Salabat Jang]] conceded to [[Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau|Bussy]] the [[Northern Circars]]. Salabat Jang was indebted  to the [[French East India Company]] for his elevation to the throne, which had been confirmed by the Mughal emperor. The agreement made between the French and Salabat Jang in [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] bears the signature of Said Loukshur, Minister of Salabat Jang. Yanam acquired considerable importance during the French occupation of the Northern Circars.\n\n===First British occupation===\nAnother important event in the history was the war between the French and the British fought at Chandurthi in 1758 in which the French were defeated. Salabat Jang made a treaty with the British and gave the Northern Circars under a ''firman'' to the British. After 1760 the French lost hold in [[South India]], especially on Northern Circars.\n\nA document dated 15 May 1765 showed that the villages of Yanam and Kapulapalem (Capouloupal\u00e9m) with other lands were handed over by Jean White Hill and George Dolben, the British representatives deputed by Jean Pybus, the head of the British settlement in [[Masulipatam]] to Yoan Yacques Panon, French [[Commissioner]] deputed by [[Jean Law de Lauriston]] the then [[Governor General]] of [[Puducherry]], for taking them over. This document mentions that France entered into possession of Yanam and its dependent territories with exemption from all export and import duties. Soon after taking possession of this settlement, Panon obtained a ''firman'' for full liberty of trade and commerce of the French in Yanam.\n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box | before= [[French East India Company]]| title=First British Occupation of [[Yanam, French India|Yanaon]]<br />([[Seven Years' War]]) | after=[[French East India Company]] | years=1758\u20131765}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n===Second British occupation===\nBetween 1778 and 1783, Puducherry was under British occupation. Yanam was restored again to the French in 1785. Mallhendre took possession of it and Bluter succeeded him. After Bluter, [[Pierre Sonnerat]] (18 August 1748 \u2013 31 March 1814) became the chief in 1790 in Yanam. He appreciated very much the sonority and the music of the Telugu language. He administered Yanam during the time of the [[French Revolution]].\n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box | before= [[French East India Company]]| title=Second British Occupation of [[Yanam, French India|Yanaon]] | after=[[French Colonial Empire]] | years=1778\u20131785}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n===Third British occupation===\nOnce again French lost control over Yanam to the British. During 1793 and 1816 Puducherry was under British control. So, Yanam fell thrice into the hands of the British. After the [[Napoleonic wars]], by the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)]] Yanam along with the factory at [[Machilipatnam]] was finally returned to the French on 26 September 1816. From then it was continuously under French control until its transfer to India in 1954.\n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box | before= [[French Colonial Empire]]| title=Final British Occupation of [[Yanam, French India|Yanaon]] <br />([[Napoleonic Wars]])| after=[[French Colonial Empire]] | years=1793\u20131816}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n==Local administration in the colonial era==\n[[File:Yanam Venkanna Babu Ratham.jpg|thumb|Venkanna Babu Ratham, Yanam]]\n\n===1840 decree===\n[[Local administration]] was started in Yanaon by a [[royal decree]] (''Ordonnance Royale'') dated 23 July 1840 during [[July Monarchy]]. According to that decree Yanaon and [[Mah\u00e9, India|Mah\u00e9]] were provided with ''Chef de service'' (Service Chief) who resides in his official residence. After the merger, it is being resided by Regional Executive Officer, Yanam.<ref>''La Gazette de l'Etat de Pondich\u00e9ry'' (''Gazette of Puducherry'')</ref>\n\n===1871 decree===\nAccording to a decree dated 1 February 1871, one person can be sent as a ''[[Legislator|d\u00e9put\u00e9]]'' to the [[Chamber of Deputies of France|Chamber of Deputies]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''La Gazette de l'Etat de Pondich\u00e9ry''</ref>\n\n===1872 decree===\nAnother pivotal incident in local administration was the decree of 1872. It was dated 13 June 1872 and was issued during [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. According to that decree ''Conseils locaux'' (Local councils) were created at each colony. The elected member was called as ''Conseiller local'' (Local councillor). Conseil local de Yanaon had a strength of 4 local councillors. The term of office was 6 years with one half of membership renewed every 3 years.<ref>''La Gazette de I'Etat de Pondich\u00e9ry''</ref>  The powers of the local councils are purely advisory. These assemblies give their opinion on the local budget project concerning the establishments to which it belongs and on all the matters of the competence of the general council.\n[[File:Yanam Ferry Road.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Ferry Road, Yanam]]\n[[File:Bus station complex at Yanam.JPG|right|250px|thumb|Rajiv Gandhi Bus station complex at Yanam]]\n\n===1878 decree===\nAccording to a decree dated 24 February 1878, one person could be sent as a [[senator|''s\u00e9nateur'']] to  the  French Senate ''([[S\u00e9nat]])''. Senators would be elected by ''Conseil colonial'' (Colonial Council) and ''Conseil local'' (Local council). First election were held on 26 March 1876.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n===1946 decree===\nBy the decree of 1946, [[French India]] (Inde fran\u00e7aise) became an ([[Territoire d'outre-mer|Overseas Territory]]) of France. Then an ''Assembl\u00e9e Repr\u00e9sentative'' (Representative Assembly) was created for each colony. Yanaon was provided with two assembly representatives (Equivalent to [[Member of Legislative Assembly|MLA]]). Currently Yanaon is holding one assembly representative.\n\nNotable assembly representatives from Yanam were [[Kamichetty Venougopala Rao Naidou]], Kamichetty Savithiry, [[Kamichetty Sri Parassourama Varaprassada Rao Naidu]] and Kanakala Tatayya Naidou.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n==Municipal administration in the colonial era==\n{{Main|Municipal Administration in French India}}\n\nThough the French established colonies in India in the seventeenth century itself, it was not until the end of the 19th century that they started civil administration in [[French India]].\n\n===French Metropolitan decree===\nA French Metropolitan decree, dated 12 March 1880 adopted a six-year term of office for mayors (''Maire''), municipal councillors (''Conseil municipaux'') and commune [[panchayat]]s (''[[commune (France)|communes]]''). Thus French India has seen a French system of municipal administration. In the past, municipal administration was virtually the pivot of the whole administrative machinery in French India. It had several features that could serve as a role model for hassle-free administration.\n\nThen a total of 10 communes were formed in which Yanaon became one commune with a strength of 12 Municipal Councillors (''conseillers municipaux''). The first elections were held on 30 May 1880.\n\n===Structure of the municipality===\n[[File:Yanam Draksharamam Road.jpg|thumb|Draksharamam Road]]\n{{See also|Yanam Municipality}}\n''La Mairie'' ([[Town Hall]]) in Yanaon is now called as Municipality Building. It was built in 19th century and is situated next to ''Court House'' in the Thiagaraja Street in Yanaon Town. During French colonial rule, [[Yanam Municipality]] had 12 ''Si\u00e8ges''. Then, they were called previously as ''Si\u00e8ge''s instead of [[ward (politics)|wards]]. Each ward is represented by a municipal councillor. Each ''commune'' possesses a mayor and a [[municipal council]] (Conseil Municipal) that manage the ''commune'' from the ''Mairie''. The life-span of a municipal council will be six years, with one half of the membership renewed every three years.\n\n===Election results of 1948===\n[[File:Children's Park in Yanam.jpg|thumb|Children's Park]]\nElections held on 24 October 1948 and 18 October 1954 are most crucial in the history of French India. In June 1948 the French and Indian Governments came to an agreement as to how the future of the French Settlements should be determined.<ref>Future of French India, by Russel H. Fifield</ref>\n\nMunicipal elections were held in [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]], [[Karikal]] and Yanam on 24 October 1948. The two main parties were the French India Socialist Party (Socialists), who favoured the continuance of French rule, and the French India Congress ([[Indian National Congress|Congress]]), who favoured union with India. Socialist Party was headed by [[Kamichetty Sri Parassourama Varaprassada Rao Naidu]] and Congress Party was headed by Yerra Jaganatha Rao.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n*'''Yanam''' \u2013 12\n**'''Socialists''' \u2013 03\n**'''[[Independent (politician)|Independents]]''' \u2013 09\n\n==Cession of Yanam==\n{{Main|Coup d'\u00c9tat de Yanaon}}\nDue to nationalist struggle by some leaders, conditions became intolerable in Yanam after its mayor and other representatives of Yanam adopted the merger resolution. The Mayor Madimchetty Satianandam, deputy mayor, and over 200 people took refuge in the adjacent areas of the [[Indian Union]]. Then 78-year-old [[Samatam Krouschnaya]] became acting mayor of Yanam. On Sunday 13 June 1954, Indian police came into action. They along with the pro-merger leaders hired hoodlums from Yanam assaulted refugees on Indian soil. It was then that the refugees marched into Yanam under the leadership of [[Dadala Raphael Ramanayya]] and aided by then Maire De Yanaon, Monsieur Madimchetty Satianarayanamourty alias Satia and took over the administration. After hoisting the [[Indian Flag|Indian National Flag]], they formed the revolutionary [[provisional government]] of Yanam headed by [[Dadala Raphael Ramanayya]] and adopted a resolution declaring \"Yanaon lib\u00e9r\u00e9\" (Yanam liberated). The coup d'\u00e9tat of Yanam was announced by [[All India Radio]] and Press.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">\"My Struggle for freedom of French Provinces in India\" autobiography written by Sri Dadala Raphael Ramanayya</ref>\n{{s-start}}\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n{{s-bef | rows=3 | before=[[French Colonial Empire]]}}\n{{s-ttl | title=[[Yanam, French India|\u00c9tablissement fran\u00e7ais de Yanaon]]<br />(de facto not recognised by France) | years=1815\u201313 June 1954}}\n{{s-aft | after=[[Provisional Government]] of Yanam}}\n|-\n{{s-ttl | title=[[Yanam, French India|\u00c9tablissement fran\u00e7ais de Yanaon]]<br />(de facto) | years=1815\u20131 November 1954}}\n{{s-aft | after=India}}\n|-\n{{s-ttl | title=[[Yanam, French India|\u00c9tablissement fran\u00e7ais de Yanaon]]<br />([[de jure]]) | years=1815\u201316 August 1962}}\n{{s-aft | after=India}}\n{{s-end}}\nAfter the coup d'\u00e9tat, the last administrator of Yanam, George Sala was recalled by [[Andr\u00e9 M\u00e9nard]], then [[Governor General]] of Puducherry in June 1954.\n\n==Aftermath of liberation==\nThe Yanam coup d'\u00e9tat had enraged the French authorities of Puducherry. Rumours were spread to the effect that the French government were despatching a [[cruiser]] to Yanam to capture Merger leaders and to re-establish their authority. After the coup, the last [[Administration (government)|administrator]] of Yanam, George Sala was recalled by [[Andr\u00e9 M\u00e9nard]], then Governor General of [[Puducherry]] in June 1954.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n[[Dadala]] was also appointed as Acting Commissioner for Yanam for 14 days. Towards the end of June 1954, [[Kewal Singh]] paid a visit to Yanam and requested Dadala's return to Pondicherry to continue his activities there. On 3 July, on Kewal Singh's request, Dadala left Yanam, after making all arrangements for its proper administration.\n\n===De facto transfer===\nYanam remained under French control till 13 June 1954, when it joined the Republic of India by Indian military action. On 1 November 1954, after long years of freedom struggle the ''de facto transfer'' (V\u0101stavik\u0101ntara\u1e47a) of the four enclaves of [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]], Yanam, [[Mah\u00e9, India|Mah\u00e9]], and [[Karikal]] to the [[Indian Union]] was achieved.\n\nThe Prime Minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], visited Puducherry on 16 January 1955. Messrs [[Edouard Goubert]], S. Perumal, Dadala and Sri Pakirisamy Pillai presented addresses to Pandit Nehru in a public meeting in the maidan of Gorimedu.\n\n===Treaty of cession===\nA treaty of cession was signed by the two countries on 28 May 1956.<ref name=\"Trait\u00e9 de Cession, 1956\">Trait\u00e9 de Cession, 1956</ref> The ''[[de jure]]'' transfer was delayed until the end of the [[Algerian War]]. The treaty was ratified by the [[French parliament]] in May 1962. On 16 August 1962 (De Jure Day) India and France exchanged the instruments of ratification under which France ceded to India full sovereignty over the territories it held.\n\n====Special administration status====\nAccording to '''Trait\u00e9 de cession''' dated 1956, the [[Inde fran\u00e7aise|four former French colonies]] were assured of maintaining their special administrative status. That is why Puducherry is the only Union Territory with some special provisions like Legislative Assembly, French as official language, etc. This is the most important article in the '''Trait\u00e9 de Cession''', which ensures and safeguardes the personal interest of the people regarding their special administrative status.\n\nThe '''Article II''' of '''Trait\u00e9 de Cession''' states that,\n* The Establishments will keep the benefit of the special administrative status in force prior to 1 November 1954. Any constitutional changes in this status which may be made subsequently shall be made after ascertaining the wishes of the people.\n\n===De jure Transfer===\nTreaty of cession was signed by the two countries in May 1956 was ratified by the [[French parliament]] in May 1962. On 16 August 1962 India and France exchanged the instruments of [[ratification]] under which France ceded to India full sovereignty over the territories it held.

It is [[Soil color|grey black]] and clay-like in composition. A few thin layers of sandy [[clay]] or [[sand]] approximating 0.3 metres in thickness, are intercalated with the clay soil. The river sand on the bank of Gauthami, Godavari consist of [[quartz]], [[felspar]] and [[mica]], with [[monazite]] found in the black streaks. There are no minerals of economic value in the region.\n\n===Irrigation===\n[[File:Sri Potti Sri Ramulu Yanam Bridge.jpg|thumb|Sri Potti Sreeramulu Yanam Bridge]]\nYanam receives irrigation water via the Bank Canal, which begins at the [[Dowleswaram]] headworks  of Sir [[Arthur Cotton]]'s [[barrage (dam)|barrage]] on the River [[Godavari River|Godavari]], downstream from [[Rajahmundry]]. The canal runs towards east to Pillanka, a village near Yanam, and is popularly known as ''French Channel'', having been built under a 1949 agreement between the then [[French Government]] and the [[Government of India]]. It provides irrigation and drinking water to the areas west of the Coringa River.\n\nAfter its merger with the [[Republic of India]], irrigation was provided to about 5.6&nbsp;km\u00b2 of dry land on the eastern side of the Coringa River by constructing an irrigation canal, the ''Adivipolam Channel'', from the tail end of Tallarevu South Canal and the starting point of the Neelapalli Channel on the right side. The work was undertaken by the Andhra Pradesh Public Works Department in 1964, and was completed and commissioned in June 1966. Like the French Channel, it provides irrigation and drinking water.\n[[File:Ferry of Yanam.jpg|thumb|Rajiv Gandhi Beach]]\n\n==Climate==\nYanam's climate is characterised by high humidity (over 70% in the day and 60% in the evenings throughout the year), a hot summer season (with humidity of 68 to 80%), and plentiful rainfall. It enjoys the benefits of both the [[Climate of India#Monsoon|Southwest]] and [[Climate of India#Monsoon|Northeast]] monsoons. Average annual rainfall is  1226&nbsp;mm.\n\n===Temperature===\n\nTemperatures in Yanam range from 27&nbsp;\u00b0C to 45&nbsp;\u00b0C in summer, and 17&nbsp;\u00b0C to 28&nbsp;\u00b0C in winter. From February, temperatures start rising rapidly until May, which is the hottest month, with the mean maximum around 37&nbsp;\u00b0C and mean minimum around 28&nbsp;\u00b0C.  Humidity being high, the heat is exhausting. The maximum temperature on some days in May or early June, before the onset of the south-west monsoon, may touch 47&nbsp;\u00b0C. The sea breeze affords some relief in the afternoons.\n\nSimilarly, pre-[[monsoon]] thunder-showers may also bring relief on some days. With the onset of the monsoon in June the temperature falls rapidly, and usually remains steady until September. In this season the mean maximum temperature is around 32&nbsp;\u00b0C, and night temperatures fall rapidly until December or January, when day temperatures are around 27&nbsp;\u00b0C, and night temperatures around 19&nbsp;\u00b0C. At times the minimum temperature may drop to 14&nbsp;\u00b0C. December and January are the coolest months.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n| 1843 | 4,000\n| 1882 | 4,536\n| 1884 | 4,552\n| 1885 | 4,266\n| 1900 | 5,005\n| 1901 | 4,681\n| 1911 | 4,727\n| 1926 | 4,995\n| 1931 | 5,249\n| 1936 | 5,220\n| 1941 | 5,711\n| 1948 | 5,853\n| 1971 | 8,291\n| 1981 | 11,631\n| 1991 | 20,297<ref>Manorama Year Book (1993), pp20</ref>\n| 2001 | 25,511\n| 2011 | 31,500\n| 2014 | 35,000\n}}\n{{As of|2001}} India census,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archivedate=2004-06-16|title= Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns  (Provisional)|accessdate=2008-11-01|publisher= Census Commission of India}}</ref> Yanam had a population of 31,362.

French law made it easy for thousands of ''colons'', ethnic or national French from former colonies of North and East Africa, India and [[Indochina]] to live in mainland France. \n\nIn Yanam, some 10,000 people chose French nationality. According to some estimates, nearly 120 to 150 [[Telugu people|Telugu]] families from former French India live in France. On the other hand, there are some French nationals living in Yanam and enjoying French pension (In [[Telugu language|Telugu]], ''Guddi Pinchanu'').\n\nThe ''Yanam French Peoples Association'' was formed and its president is Penupothu Suryanarayan. As of the 2000s, around 80 French nationals live in Yanam.\n\n==Court House (Palais de justice)==\nThe Court building is situated in an ancient white monument building of French architecture. It is called the ''Palais de justice'' ('''[[Court House]]''') and located at Thiagaraja Street, Yanam to the next of Municipality building.  The building has two floors - the ground floor is the court and the first floor is the residential quarters of the judge.  The building was renovated in 1967 and inaugurated by Thiru [[S.L. Silam]], the then [[Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry]].\n\n===Dutch India===\nYanam Judicial Magistrate Court is an ancient court formed prior to the French domain i.e. before 1725 while Yanam was as a [[Dutch India|Dutch colony]].  The Judicial Magistrate Court was existing then.\n\nSubsequently while this area came under the French on the reorganisation of French domain in 1725 the same court has been converted as French Court under French Law as a Judicial Court.  Both civil and criminal cases tried there.\n\n===After independence===\nAfter independence, the court was converted as an Indian Court as a Judicial Magistrate Court, Yanam in 1956, whereas, the Regional Administrative Officer of Yanam was the judge of the court having both executive and judicial powers on civil and criminal cases.\n\nAfter bifurcation of the judiciary, the court came under a separate Judicial Department of Government of Puducherry and under the administration of the [[Madras High Court|High Court]], [[Madras]] and it was termed as Judicial First Class Magistrate Court cum District Munsif Court. Subsequently under the reform by theHigh Court, Madras, the Yanam was upgraded to that of Subordinate Judge (Civil Judge-Senior Division)/Assistant Sessions Judge cum Judicial Magistrate of I Class in 2000.  Now because of this upgrade, all the civil cases up to the pecuniary jurisdiction of Rs. 500,000s are triable by the court. ON the criminal side, the court has jurisdiction to try all cases up to 307 IPC except cases having a death sentence.  Further the court is empowered to deal with the motor accident claims, family cases, LAOPs (Land Acquisition of Puducherry), etc.\n\n==Notable people==\n''First Laurel Poet of [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]]'', Chellapilla Venkata Kavi (1870\u20131950), One of the duo of the famous ''[[Tirupati Venkata Kavulu]]''  lived here. There were poets such as the late Villa Reddi Naidu, V. Venkataswami Naidu. Some important politicians include Kanakala Tatayya Naidou and Md.

He was killed at the age of 78 by [[Indian military]] while Yanam being seized during [[Coup d'\u00c9tat de Yanaon]].\n\nA prominent leader who was instrumental in the merger of Yanam into the Indian Union was [[Dadala Rafael Ramanayya]]. He was born in Farampeta and became a key leader of the liberation of Yanam and the other French settlements.

He was elected as MLA more than five times and been speaker for Puducherry.\n\n[[Malladi Krishna Rao]] is a politician of [[Indian National Congress]] and was Minister for Revenue includes Mines, Excise, Tourism, Civil Aviation, Sports and fisheries.\n\n==Present day==\n\n===Local administration===\n{{See also|Pondicherry Municipal Council}}\nFollowing the introduction of the Pondicherry Municipalities Act, 1973, four municipalities came into existence in [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]], [[Karaikal]], [[Mah\u00e9, India|Mah\u00e9]] and Yanam towns. The entities of Karaikal, Mahe and Yanam communes formed the municipalities of Karaikal, Mahe and Yanam. Under the new law, all functions excluding those assigned to the Chairman (i.e., those hitherto exercised by the Mayor) appointed under the municipal decree came to be exercised by the [[Commissioner]]. The Mayors were also relieved of their day-to-day administrative responsibilities enabling them to be in greater contact with the public.
