The waterway, which is actually not a [[river]] despite its name, connects [[Upper New York Bay]] on its south end to [[Long Island Sound]] on its north end. It separates the borough of [[Queens]] on [[Long Island]] from [[the Bronx]] on the [[North America]]n mainland, and also divides [[Manhattan]] from Queens and [[Brooklyn]], which is also on Long Island.<ref name=encnyc>Hodges, Godfrey. \"East RIver\" in Jackson, pp.393\u201393</ref> Because of its connection to [[Long Island Sound]], it was once also known as the ''Sound River''.<ref>[[John Montresor|Montr\u00e9sor, John]] (1766).

London.</ref> The [[tidal strait]] changes its direction of flow frequently, and is subject to strong fluctuations in its current, which are accentuated by its narrowness and variety of depths. The waterway is navigable for its entire length of {{convert|16|mi}}, and was historically the center of maritime activities in the city, although that is no longer the case.<ref name=encnyc /><ref name=fed420 />\n\n==Formation and description==\n{{see also|Hell Gate}}\nTechnically a [[Ria|drowned valley]], like the other waterways around New York City,<ref>Burrows and Wallace, p.5</ref> the strait was formed approximately 11,000 years ago at the end of the [[Wisconsin glaciation]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Staff |title=The East River Flows From Prehistoric Times To Today |url=http://www.qgazette.com/news/2005-07-20/features/049.html |newspaper=The Queens Gazette |date=July 20, 2005 |accessdate=July 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216082526/http://www.qgazette.com/news/2005-07-20/features/049.html |archive-date=February 16, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The distinct change in the shape of the strait between the lower and upper portions is evidence of this glacial activity.  The upper portion (from [[Long Island Sound]] to [[Hell Gate]]), running largely perpendicular to the glacial motion, is wide, meandering, and has deep narrow bays on both banks, scoured out by the glacier's movement.  The lower portion (from Hell Gate to [[New York Bay]]) runs north\u2013south, parallel to the glacial motion.  It is much narrower, with straight banks.  The bays that exist, as well as those that used to exist before being filled in by human activity, are largely wide and shallow.\n\n[[File:PSM V28 D451 Hell gate new york.jpg|thumb|325px|left|A navigation map for [[Hell Gate]] from c.1885, after many of the obstructions had been removed.]]\n\nThe section known as \"Hell Gate\" \u2013 from the Dutch name ''Hellegat'' meaning either \"bright strait\" or \"clear opening, given to the entire river in 1614 by explorer [[Adriaen Block]] when he passed through it in his ship ''Tyger''<ref name=\"fed420\">{{cite fednyc}} pp.419\u201320</ref><ref name=wolfe /> \u2013 is a narrow, turbulent, and particularly treacherous stretch of the river.  Tides from the Long Island Sound, New York Harbor and the [[Harlem River]] meet there, making it difficult to navigate, especially because of the number of rocky islets which once dotted it, with names such as \"Frying Pan\", \"Pot, Bread and Cheese\", \"Hen and Chicken\", \"Nigger Head\", \"Heel Top\"; \"Flood\"; and \"Gridiron\", roughly 12 islets and reefs in all,<ref>Eldredge & Horenstein (2104), p.91</ref> all of which led to a number of shipwrecks, including [[HMS Hussar (1763)|HMS ''Hussar'']], a British [[frigate]] that sank in 1780 while supposedly carrying gold and silver intended to pay British troops. The stretch has since been cleared of rocks and widened.<ref name=wolfe>Wolfe, Gerard R. \"Hell Gate and Hell Gate Bridge\" in Jackson, pp.588\u201389</ref> [[Washington Irving]] wrote of Hell Gate that the current sounded \"like a bull bellowing for more drink\" at half tide, while at full tide it slept \"as soundly as an alderman after dinner.\" He said it was like \"a peaceable fellow enough when he has no liquor at all, or when he has a skinful, but who, when half-seas over, plays the very devil.\"<ref name=fed420 />  The tidal regime is complex, with the two major tides \u2013 from the Long Island Sound and from the Atlantic Ocean \u2013 separated by about two hours; and this is without consideration of the tidal influence of the Harlem River, all of which creates a \"dangerous cataract\", as one ship's captain put it.<ref>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), pp.92\u201393</ref>\n\nThe river is navigable for its entire length of {{convert|16|mi}}.  In 1939 it was reported that the stretch from [[The Battery (Manhattan)|The Battery]] to the former [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] near [[Wallabout Bay]], a run of about {{convert|1000|yd}}, was {{convert|40|ft}} deep, the long section from there, running to the west of Roosevelt Island, through Hell Gate and to [[Throggs Neck|Throg's Neck]] was at least {{convert|35|ft}} deep, and then eastward from there the river was, at mean low tide, {{convert|168|ft}} deep.<ref name=fed420 />\n\nThe broadness of the river's channel south of Roosevelt Island is caused by the dipping of the hardy [[The Bronx|Fordham gneiss]] which underlies the island under the less strong [[Tuckahoe marble|Inwood marble]] which lies under the river bed.<ref name=concrete90 />  Why the river turns to the east as it approaches the three lower Manhattan bridges is currently geologically unknown.<ref>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), pp.90\u201391</ref>\n\n===Islands===\n[[Roosevelt Island]], a long ({{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}}) and narrow ({{convert|800|ft}}) landmass, lies in the stretch of the river between Manhattan Island and the borough of [[Queens]] roughly paralleling Manhattan's East 46th-86th Streets. The abrupt termination of the island on its north end is due to an extension of the [[125th Street (Manhattan)|125th Street Fault]].<ref name=\"concrete90\" /> Politically, the island's {{convert|147|acre|km2}} constitute part of the borough of Manhattan. It is connected to Queens by the [[Roosevelt Island Bridge]], to Manhattan by the [[Roosevelt Island Tramway]], and to both boroughs by a [[Roosevelt Island station|subway station]] served by the [[F (New York City Subway service)|F train]]. The [[Queensboro Bridge]] also runs across Roosevelt Island, and an elevator allowing both pedestrian and vehicular access to the island was added to the bridge in 1930, but elevator service was discontinued in 1955 following the opening of the Roosevelt Island Bridge, and the elevator was demolished in 1970.  The island, which was formerly known as Blackwell's Island and Welfare Island before being renamed in honor of US President [[Franklin D.

Officially named Belmont Island after one of the tunnel's financiers, the landmass's owes its popular name (after [[U Thant]], former [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]]) to the efforts of a group associated with the guru [[Sri Chinmoy]] that held mediation meetings on the island in the 1970s.  Today, the island is owned by New York State and serves as a migratory bird sanctuary that is closed to visitors.\n\nProceeding north and east from Roosevelt Island, the River's principal islands include Manhattan's [[Mill Rock]], an 8.6 acre island located about 1000 feet from Manhattan's East 96th Street; Manhattan's 520 acre [[Randalls and Wards Islands]], two formerly separate islands joined together by landfill that are home to a large public park, a number of public institutions, and the supports for the [[Triborough Bridge|Triborough]] and the [[Hell Gate Bridge]]s; the Bronx's [[Rikers Island]], once under {{convert|100|acre|km2|abbr=}} but now over {{convert|400|acres|km2|abbr=}}<ref>Steinberg, p.214</ref> following extensive landfill expansion after the island's 1884 purchase by the city as a prison farm<ref>Steinberg, p 148</ref> and still home to New York City's massive and controversial primary jail complex; and [[North and South Brother Islands (New York City)|North and South Brother Islands]], both of which also constitute part of the Bronx.<ref name=\"encnyc\" />\n\n[[File:Manhattan1781.jpg|thumb|left|237px|A map from 1781]]\n\n===Tributaries===\n\nThe [[Bronx River]],<ref name=\"Kadinsky2016\"/>{{rp|63}} [[Pugsley Creek]], and [[Westchester Creek]] drain into the northern bank of the East River in the northern section of the strait.<ref name=\"Kadinsky2016\"/>{{rp|70\u201371}} The [[Flushing River]], historically known as Flushing Creek, empties into the strait's southern bank near [[LaGuardia Airport]] via [[Flushing Bay]].<ref name=\"Kadinsky2016\"/>{{rp|98}} Further west, Luyster Creek drains into the East River in [[Astoria, Queens]].<ref name=\"Kadinsky2016\"/>{{rp|94}}\n\nNorth of [[Randalls and Wards Islands|Randalls Island]], it is joined by the [[Bronx Kill]].

After the British took over the colony in 1664, and was renamed \"New York\", the development of the waterfront continued, and a [[shipbuilding]] industry grew up once New York started exporting flour.  By the end of the 17th century, the Great Dock, located at [[Lower East Side|Corlear's Hook]] on the East River, had been built.<ref name=\"history\">Baard, Erik (2008) [http://www.eastrivernyc.org/content/history/history-to-1815/index.html \"East River: History to 1815\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408035959/http://www.eastrivernyc.org/content/history/history-to-1815/index.html |date=April 8, 2016 }} ''East River NYC''</ref>\n\n===Narrowing the river===\nHistorically, the lower portion of the strait, which separates Manhattan from Brooklyn, was one of the busiest and most important channels in the world, particularly during the first three centuries of New York City's history. Because the water along the lower Manhattan shoreline was too shallow for large boats to tie up and unload their goods, from 1686 on \u2013 after the signing of the [[Dongan Charter]], which allowed intertidal land to be owned and sold \u2013 the shoreline was \"wharfed out\" to the high-water mark by constructing retaining walls that were filled in with every conceivable kind of landfill: excrement, dead animals, ships deliberately sunk in place, ship ballast, and muck dredged from the bottom of the river. On the new land were built warehouses and other structures necessary for the burgeoning sea trade. Many of the \"water-lot\" grants went to the rich and powerful families of the merchant class, although some went to tradesmen. By 1700, the Manhattan bank of the river has been \"wharfed-out\" up to around [[Whitehall Street]], narrowing the strait of the river.<ref>Steinberg, pp.23\u201326</ref>\n\n[[File:Birds eye view New York City crop.jpeg|thumb|right|350px|A \"bird's-eye\" view of New York City from 1859; [[Wallabout Bay]] and the East River are in the foreground, the [[Hudson River]] and [[New York Bay]] in the background]]\n\nAfter the signing of the Montgomerie Charter in the late 1720s, another 127 acres of land along the Manhattan shore of the East River was authorized to be filled-in, this time to a point 400 feet beyond the low-water mark; the parts that had already been expanded to the low water mark \u2013 much of which had been devastated by a coastal storm in the early 1720s and a [[nor'easter]] in 1723 \u2013 were also expanded, narrowing the channel even further.  What had been quiet beach land was to become new streets and buildings, and the core of the city's sea-borne trade. This infilling went as far north as [[Lower East Side|Corlear's Hook]]. In addition, the city was given control of the western shore of the river from [[Wallabout Bay]] south.<ref>Steinberg, pp.26\u201328; 34</ref>\n\n===American Revolution===\nExpansion of the waterfront halted during the [[American Revolution]], in which the East River played an important role early in the conflict. On August 28, 1776, while British and Hessian troops rested after besting the Americans at the [[Battle of Long Island]], General [[George Washington]] was rounding up all the boats on the east shore of the river, in what is now Brooklyn, and used them to successfully move his troops across the river \u2013 under cover of night, rain, and fog \u2013 to Manhattan island, before the British could press their advantage. Thus, though the battle was a victory for the British, the failure of [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Sir William Howe]] to destroy the Continental Army when he had the opportunity allowed the Americans to continue fighting. Without the stealthy withdrawal across the East River, the American Revolution might have ended much earlier.<ref>Stokesbury, James L. (1991)  ''A Short History of the American Revolution'' New York: Morrow. pp.92\u201395. {{ISBN|0-688-08333-1}}</ref>\n\n[[Wallabout Bay]] on the River was the site of most of the [[Prisoners of war in the American Revolutionary War|British prison ships]] \u2013 most notoriously {{HMS|Jersey|1736|6}} \u2013 where thousands of American [[Prisoners of war in the American Revolutionary War|prisoners of war]] were held in terrible conditions.  These prisoners had come into the hands of the British after the fall of New York City on September 15, 1776, after the American loss at the Battle of Long Island and the loss of [[Fort Washington (Manhattan)|Fort Washington]] on November 16.  Prisoners began to be housed on the broken-down warships and transports in December; about 24 ships were used in total, but generally only 5 or 6 at a time.  Almost twice as many Americans died from neglect in these ships than did from all the battles in the war: as many as 12,000 soldiers, sailors and civilians.  The bodies were thrown overboard or were buried in shallow graves on the riverbanks, but their bones \u2013 some of which were collected when they washed ashore \u2013 were later relocated and are now inside the [[Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument]] in nearby [[Fort Greene Park]].  The existence of the ships and the conditions the men were held in was widely known at the time through letters, diaries and memoirs, and was a factor not only in the attitude of Americans toward the British, but in the negotiations to formally end the war.<ref name=prison>[[Edwin G. Burrows|Burrows, Edwin G.]] \"prison ships\" in {{cite enc-nyc2}}, pp.1039\u201340</ref>\n\n===Development begins again===\nAfter the war, East River waterfront development continued once more. New York State legislation, which in 1807 had authorized what would become the [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811|Commissioners Plan of 1811]], authorized the creation of new land out to 400 feet from the low water mark into the river, and with the advent of gridded streets along the new waterline \u2013 Joseph Mangin had laid out such a grid in 1803 in his ''A Plan and Regulation of the City of New York'', which was rejected by the city, but established the concept \u2013 the coastline become regularized at the same time that the strait became even narrower.<ref>Steinberg, pp.57\u201358; 73</ref>\n\nOne result of the narrowing of the East River along the shoreline of Manhattan and, later, Brooklyn \u2013 which continued until the mid-19th century when the state put a stop to it \u2013 was an increase in the speed of its current. [[Buttermilk Channel]], the strait that divides [[Governors Island]] from [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook]] in Brooklyn, and which is located directly south of the \"mouth\" of the East River, was in the early 17th century a fordable waterway across which cattle could be driven.  Further investigation by Colonel Jonathan Williams determined that the channel was by 1776 three fathoms deep ({{convert|18|feet}}), five fathoms deep ({{convert|30|feet}}) in the same spot by 1798, and when surveyed by Williams in 1807 had deepened to 7 fathoms ({{convert|42|feet}}) at low tide.  What had been almost a bridge between two landforms that were once connected had become a fully navigable channel, thanks to the constriction of the East River and the increased flow it caused. Soon, the current in the East River had become so strong that larger ships had to use auxiliary steam power in order to turn.<ref>Steinberg, pp.81\u201382, 89\u201390, 107</ref>  The continued narrowing of the channel on both side may have been the reasoning behind the suggestion of one New York State Senator, who wanted to fill in the East River and annex Brooklyn, with the cost of doing so being covered by selling the newly made land.<ref>Burrows and Wallace, p.719</ref>  Others proposed a dam at Roosevelt Island (then Blackwell's Island) to create a wet basin for shipping.<ref name=unbound127>Steinberg, p.127</ref>\n\n[[File:New York and Vicinity as Proposed to be Remodeled crop.png|thumb|right|375px|James E. Serrell's plan for an expanded Manhattan and a straightened East River]]\n\n===Filling in the river===\nFilling in part of the river was also proposed in 1867 by engineer James E. Serrell, later a city surveyor, but with emphasis on solving the problem of Hell Gate. Serrell proposed filling in Hell Gate and building a \"New East River\" through Queens with an extension to [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].<ref name=unbound127/><ref>[[New York Public Library]] (1901) [https://books.google.com/books?id=MpZJAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22James%20E.%20Serrell%22%20%22East%20River%22&pg=PA109#v=onepage&q=%22James%20E.%20Serrell%22%20%22East%20River%22 ''Bulletin of the New York Public Library''] p.109 Quote: \"Plan and description proposing to re model the city of New York and its vicinity By making a New East River filling up Hell Gate and annexing Brooklyn also extending into Westchester County By James E Serrell ... 1869\"</ref><ref>[[New York Public Library]] (1913) [https://archive.org/details/selectedlistref00librgoog/page/n11 <!-- pg=7 quote=\"James E.

The New East River through Queens would be about three times the average width of the existing one at an even {{convert|3600|ft|m}} throughout, and would run as straight as an arrow for five miles.  The new land, and the portions of Queens which would become part of Manhattan, adding {{convert|2500|acre|ha}}, would be covered with an extension of the existing street grid of Manhattan.<ref>Koeppel (2015), pp.202\u201304</ref>\n\nVariations on Serrell's plan would be floated over the years.  A pseudonymous \"Terra Firma\" brought up filling in the East River again in the ''Evening Post'' and ''[[Scientific American]]'' in 1904, and [[Thomas Edison|Thomas Alva Edison]] took it up in 1906.  Then Thomas Kennard Thompson, a bridge and railway engineer, proposed in 1913 to fill in the river from Hell Gate to the tip of Manhattan and, as Serrell had suggested, make a new canalized East River, only this time from [[Flushing Bay]] to [[Jamaica Bay]]. He would also expand Brooklyn into the Upper Harbor, put up a dam from Brooklyn to [[Staten Island]], and make extensive landfill in the Lower Bay.  At around the same time, in the 1920s, Dr. John A. Harriss, New York City's chief traffic engineer, who had developed the first traffic signals in the city, also had plans for the river.  Harriss wanted to dam the East River at Hell Gate and the Williamsburg Bridge, then remove the water, put a roof over it on stilts, and build boulevards and pedestrian lanes on the roof along with \"majestic structures\", with transportation services below.  The East River's course would, once again, be shifted to run through Queens, and this time Brooklyn as well, to channel it to the Harbor.<ref>Koeppel (2015), pp.221\u2013226</ref>\n\n===Clearing Hell Gate===\n{{main|Removal of Hell Gate rocks}}\n\nPeriodically, merchants and other interested parties would try to get something done about the difficulty of navigating through Hell Gate. In 1832, the New York State legislature was presented with a petition for a canal to be built through nearby Hallet's Point, thus avoiding Hell Gate altogether.  Instead, the legislature responded by providing ships with pilots trained to navigate the shoals for the next 15 years.<ref name=concrete93>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), p.93</ref>\n\nIn 1849, a French engineer whose specialty was underwater blasting, [[Benjamin Maillefert]], had cleared some of the rocks which, along with the mix of tides, made the Hell Gate stretch of the river so dangerous to navigate.  Ebenezer Meriam had organized a subscription to pay Maillefert $6,000 to, for instance, reduce \"Pot Rock\" to provide {{convert|24|ft}} of depth at low-mean water.  While ships continued to run aground (in the 1850s about 2% of ships did so) and petitions continued to call for action, the federal government undertook surveys of the area which ended in 1851 with a detailed and accurate map.<ref name=concrete93 />  By then Maillefert had cleared the rock \"Baldheaded Billy\", and it was reported that Pot Rock had been reduced to {{convert|20.5|ft}}, which encouraged the [[United States Congress]] to appropriate $20,000 for further clearing of the strait.  However, a more accurate survey showed that the depth of Pot Rock was actually a little more than {{convert|18|ft}}, and eventually Congress withdrew its funding.<ref>Steinberg, pp.99\u2013100</ref>\n\n[[File:PSM V28 D454 Hallet point excavations and tunnel 7.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The excavations and tunnels used to undermine Hallert's Point]]\n\nWith the main shipping channels through The Narrows into the harbor silting up with sand due to [[Longshore drift|littoral drift]], thus providing ships with less depth, and a new generation of larger ships coming online \u2013 epitomized by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']], popularly known as \"Leviathan\" \u2013 New York began to be concerned that it would start to lose its status as a great port if a \"back door\" entrance into the harbor was not created.<ref>Steinberg, pp.105\u2013106</ref>  In the 1850s the depth continued to lessen \u2013 the harbor commission said in 1850 that the mean water low was {{convert|24|ft}} and the extreme water low was {{convert|23|ft}} \u2013 while the draft required by the new ships continued to increase, meaning it was only safe for them to enter the harbor at high tide.<ref>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), pp.94\u201395</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Congress, realizing that the problem needed to be addressed, appropriated $20,000 for the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] to continue Maillefert's work, but the money was soon spent without appreciable change in the hazards of navigating the strait.  An advisory council recommended in 1856 that the strait be cleared of all obstacles, but nothing was done, and the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] soon broke out.<ref name=concrete95>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), p.95</ref>\n\nIn the late 1860s, after the Civil War, Congress realized the military importance of having easily navigable waterways, and charged the Army Corps of Engineers with clearing Hell Gate of the rocks there that caused a danger to navigation. The Corps' Colonel James Newton estimated that the project would cost $1 million, as compared to the approximate annual loss in shipping of $2 million.  Initial forays floundered, and Newton, by that time a general, took over direct control of the project.<ref name=concrete95 />  In 1868 Newton decided, with the support of both New York's mercantile class and local real estate interests, to focus on the {{convert|3|acre|ha|adj=on}} Hallert's Point Reef off of Queens.  The project would involve {{convert| 7,000|ft}} of tunnels equipped with trains to haul debris out as the reef was eviscerated, creating a reef structured like \"swiss cheese\" which Newton would then blow up.  After seven years of digging seven thousand holes, and filling four thousand of them with {{convert|30000|lb}} of dynamite, on September 24, 1876, in front of an audience of people including the inhabitants of the insane asylum on Wards Island, but not the prisoners of Roosevelt Island \u2013 then called Blackwell's Island \u2013 who remained in their cells, Newton's daughter set off the explosion. The effect was immediate in decreased turbulence through the strait, and fewer accidents and shipwrecks.  The city's [[Chamber of commerce|Chamber of Commerce]] commented that \"The Centennial year will be for ever known in the annals of commerce for this destruction of one of the terrors of navigation.\"  Clearing out the debris from the explosion took until 1891.<ref name=fed420 /><ref name=wolfe /><ref name=\"Steinberg, pp.139, 142-43\">Steinberg, pp.139, 142\u201343</ref><ref>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), pp.95\u201396</ref>\n\nThen, in 1885, Flood Rock, a {{convert|9|acre|ha|adj=on}} reef that Newton had begun to undermine even before starting on Hallert's Rock, removing {{convert|8,000|cuyd}} of rock from the reef, was blown up as well, with Civil War General [[Philip Sheridan]] and abolitionist [[Henry Ward Beecher]] among those in attendance, and Newton's daughter once more setting off the blast, the biggest ever to that date, and reportedly the largest man-made explosion until the advent of the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]]<ref name=fed420 /><ref name=wolfe /><ref name=\"Steinberg, pp.139, 142-43\"/><ref name=Whitt>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE3D71631F931A35755C0A9609C8B63 |title=The East River is Cleaner Now.

Two years later, plans were in place to dredge Hell Gate to a consistent depth of {{convert|26|ft}}.<ref name=concrete96>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), p.96</ref>\n\nAt the same time that Hell Gate was being cleared, the [[Spuyten Duyvil Creek|Harlem River Ship Canal]] was being planned.  When it was completed in 1895, the \"back door\" to New York's center of ship-borne trade in the docks and warehouses of the East River was open from two directions, through the cleared East River, and from the Hudson River through the [[Harlem River]] to the East River.<ref>Steinberg, p.140</ref> Ironically, though, while both forks of the northern shipping entrance to the city were now open, modern dredging techniques had cut through the sandbars of the Atlantic Ocean entrance, allowing new, even larger ships to use that traditional passage into New York's docks.<ref name=concrete96 />\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, the East River was the center of New York's shipping industry, but by the end of the century, much of it had moved to the Hudson River, leaving the East River wharves and slips to begin a long process of decay, until the area was finally rehabilitated in the mid-1960s, and the [[South Street Seaport|South Street Seaport Museum]] was opened in 1967.<ref>{{cite naming|page=34}}</ref>\n\n===A new seawall===\nBy 1870, the condition of the Port of New York along both the East and Hudson Rivers had so deteriorated that the New York State legislature created the Department of Docks to renovate the port and keep New York competitive with other ports on the American East Coast.  The Department of Docks was given the task of creating the master plan for the waterfront, and General [[George B. McClellan]] was engaged to head the project.  McClellan held public hearings and invited plans to be submitted, ultimately receiving 70 of them, although in the end he and his successors put his own plan into effect.  That plan called for the building of a seawall around Manhattan island from [[List of numbered streets in Manhattan|West 61st Street]] on the Hudson, around [[The Battery (Manhattan)|The Battery]], and up to [[51st Street (Manhattan)|East 51st Street]] on the East River.  The area behind the masonry wall (mostly concrete but in some parts granite blocks) would be filled in with landfill, and wide streets would be laid down on the new land.  In this way, a new edge for the island (or at least the part of it used as a commercial port) would be created.<ref name=concrete184>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), pp.184\u2013186</ref>\n\nThe Department had surveyed {{convert|13,700|ft}} of shoreline by 1878, as well as documenting the currents and tides. By 1900, {{convert|75|mi}} had been surveyed and core samples had been taken to inform the builders of how deep the bedrock was. The work was completed just as [[World War I]] began, allowing the Port of New York to be a major point of embarkation for troops and materiel.<ref name=concrete184 />\n\nThe new seawall helps protect Manhattan island from storm surges, although it is only {{convert|5|ft}} above the mean sea level, so that particularly dangerous storms, such as the [[nor'easter]] of 1992 and [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012, which hit the city in a way to create surges which are much higher, can still do significant damage. (The Hurricane of September 3, 1831 created the biggest storm surge on record in New York City: a rise of {{convert|13|ft}} in one hour at the Battery, flooding all of lower Manhattan up to [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]].)  Still, the new seawall begun in 1871 gave the island a firmer edge, improved the quality of the port, and continues to protect Manhattan from normal storm surges.<ref name=concrete184 />\n\n===Bridges and tunnels===\n{{see also|#Crossings}}\nThe [[Brooklyn Bridge]], completed in 1883, was the first bridge to span the East River, connecting the cities of New York and [[Brooklyn]], and all but replacing the frequent ferry service between them, which did not return until the late 20th century.  The bridge offered [[cable car (railway)|cable car]] service across the span.  The Brooklyn Bridge was followed by the [[Williamsburg Bridge]] (1903), the [[Queensboro Bridge]] (1909), the [[Manhattan Bridge]] (1912) and the [[Hell Gate Bridge|Hell Gate Railroad Bridge]] (1916). Later would come the [[Triborough Bridge]] (1936), the [[Bronx\u2013Whitestone Bridge|Bronx-Whitestone Bridge]] (1939), the [[Throgs Neck Bridge]] (1961) and the [[Rikers Island|Rikers Island Bridge]] (1966).  In addition, numerous rail tunnels pass under the East River \u2013 most of them part of the [[New York City Subway]] system \u2013 as does the [[Brooklyn\u2013Battery Tunnel|Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel]] and the [[Queens\u2013Midtown Tunnel|Queens-Midtown Tunnel]]. (See [[#Crossings|Crossings]] below for details.)  Also under the river is Water Tunnel #1 of the [[New York City water supply system]], built in 1917 to extend the Manhattan portion of the tunnel to Brooklyn, and via City Tunnel #2 (1936) to Queens; these boroughs became part of New York City after the city's consolidation in 1898.<ref>Burrows and Wallace, p.1229</ref><ref name=\"water\">[[New York City Department of Environmental Protection]] [http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/dep_projects/cp_city_water_tunnel3.shtml \"City Water Tunnel #3\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401173724/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/dep_projects/cp_city_water_tunnel3.shtml |date=April 1, 2016 }}</ref> City Tunnel #3 will also run under the river, under the northern tip of Roosevelt Island, and is expected to be completed by 2018; the Manhattan portion of the tunnel went into service in 2013.<ref name=water />\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\nPhilanthropist [[John D.

The sewers terminated at the slips where ships docked, until the waste began to build up, preventing dockage, after which the outfalls were moved to the end of the piers.  The \"landfill\" which created new land along the shoreline when the river was \"wharfed out\" by the sale of \"water lots\" was largely garbage such as bones, offal, and even whole dead animals, along with excrement \u2013 human and animal.<ref>Steinberg, 23\u201328, ''passim''</ref><ref>Burrows and Wallace, p.185</ref>  The result was that by the 1850s, if not before, the East River, like the other waterways around the city, was undergoing the process of [[eutrophication]] where the increase in [[nitrogen]] from excrement and other sources led to a decrease in free [[oxygen]], which in turn led to an increase in [[phytoplankton]] such as [[algae]] and a decrease in other life forms, breaking the area's established food chain. The East River became very polluted, and its animal life decreased drastically.<ref>Steinberg, pp.118\u201319</ref>\n\nIn an earlier time, one person had described the transparency of the water: \"I remember the time, gentlemen, when you could go in twelve feet of water and you could see the pebbles on the bottom of this river.\"  As the water got more polluted, it darkened, underwater vegetation (such as [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizing]] [[seagrass]]) began dying, and as the seagrass beds declined, the many associated species of their ecosystems declined as well, contributing to the decline of the river. Also harmful was the general destruction of the once plentiful [[Oyster|oyster beds]] in the waters around the city,<ref group=notes>Oysters were so plentiful in New Amsterdam and early New York that they were considered to be food for the poor, although the rich also ate them in great numbers. They were sold in specialized \"oyster shops\" and by vendors on the street, some of which were paved with their shells. Pearl Street was named after the piles of oysters left there by the Native Americans of the area. \"Enjoy the oysters\" was often said to a person planning on traveling to New York City, so strong was the bivalve as an icon of the city. It was only after the collapse of the local oyster beds, by around 1920, that oysters became scarce, and a delicacy only affordable by the rich.{{parabr}}{{nb5}}Burrows and Wallace, pp.460, 798, 816<br>{{nb5}}Kurlansky, Mark \"oysters\" in {{cite enc-nyc2}}, pp.963\u2013964<br>{{nb5}}Steinberg, pp.7, 170\u201371</ref> and the over-fishing of [[menhaden]], or [[Menhaden|mossbunker]], a small silvery fish which had been used since the time of the Native Americans for fertilizing crops \u2013 however it took 8,000 of these schooling fish to fertilize a single acre, so mechanized fishing using the [[Seine fishing|purse seine]] was developed, and eventually the menhaden population collapsed.  Menhaden feed on phytoplankton, helping to keep them in check, and are also a vital step in the food chain, as [[bluefish]], [[striped bass]] and other fish species which do not eat phytoplankton feed on the menhaden.  The oyster is another filter feeder: oysters purify 10 to 100 gallons a day, while each menhaden filters four gallons in a minute, and their schools were immense: one report had a farmer collecting 20 oxcarts worth of menhaden using simple fishing nets deployed from the shore.  The combination of more sewage, due to the availability of more potable water \u2013 New York's water consumption ''per capita'' was twice that of Europe \u2013 indoor plumbing, the destruction of filter feeders, and the collapse of the food chain, damaged the ecosystem of the waters around New York, including the East River, almost beyond repair.<ref>Steinberg, pp.166\u201373</ref>\n\nBecause of these changes to the ecosystem, by 1909, the level of dissolved-oxygen in the lower part of the river had declined to less than 65%, where 55% of saturation is the point at which the amount of fish and the number of their species begins to be affected.<ref>Steinberg, pp.161, 163\u201364</ref> Only 17 years later, by 1926, the level of dissolved oxygen in the river had fallen to 13%, below the point at which most fish species can survive.<ref>Steinberg, p.177</ref>\n\n<!--The following information, right up to the 8/30/07 NY Times footnote, is covered by the source in that footnote.

The waterway, which is actually not a [[river]] despite its name, connects [[Upper New York Bay]] on its south end to [[Long Island Sound]] on its north end. It separates the borough of [[Queens]] on [[Long Island]] from [[the Bronx]] on the [[North America]]n mainland, and also divides [[Manhattan]] from Queens and [[Brooklyn]], which is also on Long Island.<ref name=encnyc>Hodges, Godfrey. \"East RIver\" in Jackson, pp.393\u201393</ref> Because of its connection to [[Long Island Sound]], it was once also known as the ''Sound River''.<ref>[[John Montresor|Montr\u00e9sor, John]] (1766).

The upper portion (from [[Long Island Sound]] to [[Hell Gate]]), running largely perpendicular to the glacial motion, is wide, meandering, and has deep narrow bays on both banks, scoured out by the glacier's movement.  The lower portion (from Hell Gate to [[New York Bay]]) runs north-south, parallel to the glacial motion.  It is much narrower, with straight banks.  The bays that exist, as well as those that used to exist before being filled in by human activity, are largely wide and shallow.\n\n[[File:PSM V28 D451 Hell gate new york.jpg|thumb|325px|left|A navigation map for [[Hell Gate]] from c.1885, after many of the obstructions had been removed.]]\n\nThe section known as \"Hell Gate\" \u2013 from the Dutch name ''Hellegat'' meaning either \"bright strait\" or \"clear opening, given to the entire river in 1614 by explorer [[Adriaen Block]] when he passed through it in his ship ''Tyger''<ref name=\"fed420\">{{cite fednyc}} pp.419\u201320</ref><ref name=wolfe /> \u2013 is a narrow, turbulent, and particularly treacherous stretch of the river.  Tides from the Long Island Sound, New York Harbor and the [[Harlem River]] meet there, making it difficult to navigate, especially because of the number of rocky islets which once dotted it, with names such as \"Frying Pan\", \"Pot, Bread and Cheese\", \"Hen and Chicken\", \"Nigger Head\", \"Heel Top\"; \"Flood\"; and \"Gridiron\", roughly 12 islets and reefs in all,<ref>Eldredge & Horenstein (2104), p.91</ref> all of which led to a number of shipwrecks, including [[HMS Hussar (1763)|HMS ''Hussar'']], a British [[frigate]] that sank in 1780 while supposedly carrying gold and silver intended to pay British troops. The stretch has since been cleared of rocks and widened.<ref name=wolfe>Wolfe, Gerard R. \"Hell Gate and Hell Gate Bridge\" in Jackson, pp.588\u201389</ref> [[Washington Irving]] wrote of Hell Gate that the current sounded \"like a bull bellowing for more drink\" at half tide, while at full tide it slept \"as soundly as an alderman after dinner.\" He said it was like \"a peaceable fellow enough when he has no liquor at all, or when he has a skinful, but who, when half-seas over, plays the very devil.\"<ref name=fed420 />  The tidal regime is complex, with the two major tides \u2013 from the Long Island Sound and from the Atlantic Ocean \u2013 separated by about two hours; and this is without consideration of the tidal influence of the Harlem River, all of which creates a \"dangerous cataract\", as one ship's captain put it.<ref>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), pp.92\u201393</ref>\n\nThe river is navigable for its entire length of {{convert|16|mi}}.  In 1939 it was reported that the stretch from [[The Battery (Manhattan)|The Battery]] to the former [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] near [[Wallabout Bay]], a run of about {{convert|1000|yd}}, was {{convert|40|ft}} deep, the long section from there, running to the west of Roosevelt Island, through Hell Gate and to [[Throggs Neck|Throg's Neck]] was at least {{convert|35|ft}} deep, and then eastward from there the river was, at mean low tide, {{convert|168|ft}} deep.<ref name=fed420 />\n\nThe broadness of the river's channel south of Roosevelt Island is caused by the dipping of the hardy [[The Bronx|Fordham gneiss]] which underlies the island under the less strong [[Tuckahoe marble|Inwood marble]] which lies under the river bed.<ref name=concrete90 />  Why the river turns to the east as it approaches the three lower Manhattan bridges is currently geologically unknown.<ref>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), pp.90\u201391</ref>\n\n===Islands===\n[[Roosevelt Island]], a long ({{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}}) and narrow ({{convert|800|ft}}) landmass, lies in the stretch of the river between Manhattan Island and the borough of [[Queens]] roughly paralleling Manhattan's East 46th-86th Streets. The abrupt termination of the island on its north end is due to an extension of the [[125th Street (Manhattan)|125th Street Fault]].<ref name=\"concrete90\" /> Politically, the island's {{convert|147|acre|km2}} constitute part of the borough of Manhattan. It is connected to Queens by the [[Roosevelt Island Bridge]], to Manhattan by the [[Roosevelt Island Tramway]], and to both boroughs by a [[Roosevelt Island station|subway station]] served by the [[F (New York City Subway service)|F train]]. The [[Queensboro Bridge]] also runs across Roosevelt Island, and an elevator allowing both pedestrian and vehicular access to the island was added to the bridge in 1930, but elevator service was discontinued in 1955 following the opening of the Roosevelt Island Bridge, and the elevator was demolished in 1970.  The island, which was formerly known as Blackwell's Island and Welfare Island before being renamed in honor of US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], historically served as the site of a [[prison|penitentiary]] and a number of hospitals; today, it is dominated by residential neighborhoods consisting of large apartment buildings and park land (much of which is dotted with the ruins of older structures).\n\nThe largest land mass in the River south of Roosevelt Island is [[U Thant Island]], an artificial islet created during the construction of the [[Steinway Tunnel]] (which currently serves the [[7 (New York City Subway service)|subway's 7 and <7> lines)]].  Officially named Belmont Island after one of the tunnel's financiers, the landmass's owes its popular name (after [[U Thant]], former [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]]) to the efforts of a group associated with the guru [[Sri Chinmoy]] that held mediation meetings on the island in the 1970s.  Today, the island is owned by New York State and serves as a migratory bird sanctuary that is closed to visitors. \n\nProceeding north and east from Roosevelt Island, the River's principal islands include Manhattan's [[Mill Rock]], an 8.6 acre island located about 1000 feet from Manhattan's East 96th Street; Manhattan's 520 acre [[Randalls and Wards Islands]], two formerly separate islands joined together by landfill that are home to a large public park, a number of public institutions, and the supports for the [[Triborough Bridge|Triborough]] and the [[Hell Gate Bridge|Hell Gate Bridges]]; the Bronx's [[Rikers Island]], once under {{convert|100|acre|km2|abbr=}} but now over {{convert|400|acres|km2|abbr=}}<ref>Steinberg, p.214</ref> following extensive landfill expansion after the island's 1884 purchase by the city as a prison farm<ref>Steinberg, p 148</ref> and still home to New York City's massive and controversial primary jail complex; and [[North and South Brother Islands (New York City)|North and South Brother Islands]], both of which also constitute part of the Bronx.<ref name=\"encnyc\" />\n\n[[File:Manhattan1781.jpg|thumb|left|237px|A map from 1781]]\n\n===Tributaries===\n\nThe [[Bronx River]],<ref name=\"Kadinsky2016\"/>{{rp|63}} [[Pugsley Creek]], and [[Westchester Creek]] drain into the northern bank of the East River in the northern section of the strait.<ref name=\"Kadinsky2016\"/>{{rp|70\u201371}} The [[Flushing River]], historically known as Flushing Creek, empties into the strait's southern bank near [[LaGuardia Airport]] via [[Flushing Bay]].<ref name=\"Kadinsky2016\"/>{{rp|98}} Further west, Luyster Creek drains into the East River in [[Astoria, Queens]].<ref name=\"Kadinsky2016\"/>{{rp|94}}\n\nNorth of [[Randalls and Wards Islands|Randalls Island]], it is joined by the [[Bronx Kill]].

After the British took over the colony in 1664, and was renamed \"New York\", the development of the waterfront continued, and a [[shipbuilding]] industry grew up once New York started exporting flour.  By the end of the 17th century, the Great Dock, located at [[Lower East Side|Corlear's Hook]] on the East River, had been built.<ref name=\"history\">Baard, Erik (2008) [http://www.eastrivernyc.org/content/history/history-to-1815/index.html \"East River: History to 1815\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408035959/http://www.eastrivernyc.org/content/history/history-to-1815/index.html |date=April 8, 2016 }} ''East River NYC''</ref>\n\n===Narrowing the river===\nHistorically, the lower portion of the strait, which separates Manhattan from Brooklyn, was one of the busiest and most important channels in the world, particularly during the first three centuries of New York City's history. Because the water along the lower Manhattan shoreline was too shallow for large boats to tie up and unload their goods, from 1686 on \u2013 after the signing of the [[Dongan Charter]], which allowed intertidal land to be owned and sold \u2013 the shoreline was \"wharfed out\" to the high-water mark by constructing retaining walls that were filled in with every conceivable kind of landfill: excrement, dead animals, ships deliberately sunk in place, ship ballast, and muck dredged from the bottom of the river. On the new land were built warehouses and other structures necessary for the burgeoning sea trade. Many of the \"water-lot\" grants went to the rich and powerful families of the merchant class, although some went to tradesmen. By 1700, the Manhattan bank of the river has been \"wharfed-out\" up to around [[Whitehall Street]], narrowing the strait of the river.<ref>Steinberg, pp.23\u201326</ref>\n\n[[File:Birds eye view New York City crop.jpeg|thumb|right|350px|A \"bird's-eye\" view of New York City from 1859; [[Wallabout Bay]] and the East River are in the foreground, the [[Hudson River]] and [[New York Bay]] in the background]]\n\nAfter the signing of the Montgomerie Charter in the late 1720s, another 127 acres of land along the Manhattan shore of the East River was authorized to be filled-in, this time to a point 400 feet beyond the low-water mark; the parts that had already been expanded to the low water mark \u2013 much of which had been devastated by a coastal storm in the early 1720s and a [[nor'easter]] in 1723 \u2013 were also expanded, narrowing the channel even further.  What had been quiet beach land was to become new streets and buildings, and the core of the city's sea-borne trade. This infilling went as far north as [[Lower East Side|Corlear's Hook]]. In addition, the city was given control of the western shore of the river from [[Wallabout Bay]] south.<ref>Steinberg, pp.26\u201328; 34</ref>\n\n===American Revolution===\nExpansion of the waterfront halted during the [[American Revolution]], in which the East River played an important role early in the conflict. On August 28, 1776, while British and Hessian troops rested after besting the Americans at the [[Battle of Long Island]], General [[George Washington]] was rounding up all the boats on the east shore of the river, in what is now Brooklyn, and used them to successfully move his troops across the river \u2013 under cover of night, rain, and fog \u2013 to Manhattan island, before the British could press their advantage. Thus, though the battle was a victory for the British, the failure of [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Sir William Howe]] to destroy the Continental Army when he had the opportunity allowed the Americans to continue fighting. Without the stealthy withdrawal across the East River, the American Revolution might have ended much earlier.<ref>Stokesbury, James L. (1991)  ''A Short History of the American Revolution'' New York: Morrow. pp.92\u201395. {{ISBN|0-688-08333-1}}</ref>\n\n[[Wallabout Bay]] on the River was the site of most of the [[Prisoners of war in the American Revolutionary War|British prison ships]] \u2013 most notoriously {{HMS|Jersey|1736|6}} \u2013 where thousands of American [[Prisoners of war in the American Revolutionary War|prisoners of war]] were held in terrible conditions.  These prisoners had come into the hands of the British after the fall of New York City on September 15, 1776, after the American loss at the Battle of Long Island and the loss of [[Fort Washington (Manhattan)|Fort Washington]] on November 16.  Prisoners began to be housed on the broken-down warships and transports in December; about 24 ships were used in total, but generally only 5 or 6 at a time.  Almost twice as many Americans died from neglect in these ships than did from all the battles in the war: as many as 12,000 soldiers, sailors and civilians.  The bodies were thrown overboard or were buried in shallow graves on the riverbanks, but their bones \u2013 some of which were collected when they washed ashore \u2013 were later relocated and are now inside the [[Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument]] in nearby [[Fort Greene Park]].  The existence of the ships and the conditions the men were held in was widely known at the time through letters, diaries and memoirs, and was a factor not only in the attitude of Americans toward the British, but in the negotiations to formally end the war.<ref name=prison>[[Edwin G. Burrows|Burrows, Edwin G.]] \"prison ships\" in {{cite enc-nyc2}}, pp.1039\u201340</ref>\n\n===Development begins again===\nAfter the war, East River waterfront development continued once more. New York State legislation, which in 1807 had authorized what would become the [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811|Commissioners Plan of 1811]], authorized the creation of new land out to 400 feet from the low water mark into the river, and with the advent of gridded streets along the new waterline \u2013 Joseph Mangin had laid out such a grid in 1803 in his ''A Plan and Regulation of the City of New York'', which was rejected by the city, but established the concept \u2013 the coastline become regularized at the same time that the strait became even narrower.<ref>Steinberg, pp.57\u201358; 73</ref>\n\nOne result of the narrowing of the East River along the shoreline of Manhattan and, later, Brooklyn \u2013 which continued until the mid-19th century when the state put a stop to it \u2013 was an increase in the speed of its current. [[Buttermilk Channel]], the strait that divides [[Governors Island]] from [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook]] in Brooklyn, and which is located directly south of the \"mouth\" of the East River, was in the early 17th century a fordable waterway across which cattle could be driven.  Further investigation by Colonel Jonathan Williams determined that the channel was by 1776 three fathoms deep ({{convert|18|feet}}), five fathoms deep ({{convert|30|feet}}) in the same spot by 1798, and when surveyed by Williams in 1807 had deepened to 7 fathoms ({{convert|42|feet}}) at low tide.  What had been almost a bridge between two landforms that were once connected had become a fully navigable channel, thanks to the constriction of the East River and the increased flow it caused. Soon, the current in the East River had become so strong that larger ships had to use auxiliary steam power in order to turn.<ref>Steinberg, pp.81\u201382, 89\u201390, 107</ref>  The continued narrowing of the channel on both side may have been the reasoning behind the suggestion of one New York State Senator, who wanted to fill in the East River and annex Brooklyn, with the cost of doing so being covered by selling the newly made land.<ref>Burrows and Wallace, p.719</ref>  Others proposed a dam at Roosevelt Island (then Blackwell's Island) to create a wet basin for shipping.<ref name=unbound127>Steinberg, p.127</ref>\n\n[[File:New York and Vicinity as Proposed to be Remodeled crop.png|thumb|right|375px|James E. Serrell's plan for an expanded Manhattan and a straightened East River]]\n\n===Filling in the river===\nFilling in part of the river was also proposed in 1867 by engineer James E. Serrell, later a city surveyor, but with emphasis on solving the problem of Hell Gate. Serrell proposed filling in Hell Gate and building a \"New East River\" through Queens with an extension to [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].<ref name=unbound127/><ref>[[New York Public Library]] (1901) [https://books.google.com/books?id=MpZJAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22James%20E.%20Serrell%22%20%22East%20River%22&pg=PA109#v=onepage&q=%22James%20E.%20Serrell%22%20%22East%20River%22 ''Bulletin of the New York Public Library''] p.109 Quote: \"Plan and description proposing to re model the city of New York and its vicinity By making a New East River filling up Hell Gate and annexing Brooklyn also extending into Westchester County By James E Serrell ... 1869\"</ref><ref>[[New York Public Library]] (1913) [https://archive.org/details/selectedlistref00librgoog/page/n11 <!-- pg=7 quote=\"James E.

The New East River through Queens would be about three times the average width of the existing one at an even {{convert|3600|ft|m}} throughout, and would run as straight as an arrow for five miles.  The new land, and the portions of Queens which would become part of Manhattan, adding {{convert|2500|acre|ha}}, would be covered with an extension of the existing street grid of Manhattan.<ref>Koeppel (2015), pp.202\u201304</ref>\n\nVariations on Serrell's plan would be floated over the years.  A pseudonymous \"Terra Firma\" brought up filling in the East River again in the ''Evening Post'' and ''[[Scientific American]]'' in 1904, and [[Thomas Edison|Thomas Alva Edison]] took it up in 1906.  Then Thomas Kennard Thompson, a bridge and railway engineer, proposed in 1913 to fill in the river from Hell Gate to the tip of Manhattan and, as Serrell had suggested, make a new canalized East River, only this time from [[Flushing Bay]] to [[Jamaica Bay]]. He would also expand Brooklyn into the Upper Harbor, put up a dam from Brooklyn to [[Staten Island]], and make extensive landfill in the Lower Bay.  At around the same time, in the 1920s, Dr. John A. Harriss, New York City's chief traffic engineer, who had developed the first traffic signals in the city, also had plans for the river.  Harriss wanted to dam the East River at Hell Gate and the Williamsburg Bridge, then remove the water, put a roof over it on stilts, and build boulevards and pedestrian lanes on the roof along with \"majestic structures\", with transportation services below.  The East River's course would, once again, be shifted to run through Queens, and this time Brooklyn as well, to channel it to the Harbor.<ref>Koeppel (2015), pp.221\u2013226</ref>\n\n===Clearing Hell Gate===\n{{main|Removal of Hell Gate rocks}}\n\nPeriodically, merchants and other interested parties would try to get something done about the difficulty of navigating through Hell Gate. In 1832, the New York State legislature was presented with a petition for a canal to be built through nearby Hallet's Point, thus avoiding Hell Gate altogether.  Instead, the legislature responded by providing ships with pilots trained to navigate the shoals for the next 15 years.<ref name=concrete93>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), p.93</ref>\n\nIn 1849, a French engineer whose specialty was underwater blasting, [[Benjamin Maillefert]], had cleared some of the rocks which, along with the mix of tides, made the Hell Gate stretch of the river so dangerous to navigate.  Ebenezer Meriam had organized a subscription to pay Maillefert $6,000 to, for instance, reduce \"Pot Rock\" to provide {{convert|24|ft}} of depth at low-mean water.  While ships continued to run aground (in the 1850s about 2% of ships did so) and petitions continued to call for action, the federal government undertook surveys of the area which ended in 1851 with a detailed and accurate map.<ref name=concrete93 />  By then Maillefert had cleared the rock \"Baldheaded Billy\", and it was reported that Pot Rock had been reduced to {{convert|20.5|ft}}, which encouraged the [[United States Congress]] to appropriate $20,000 for further clearing of the strait.  However, a more accurate survey showed that the depth of Pot Rock was actually a little more than {{convert|18|ft}}, and eventually Congress withdrew its funding.<ref>Steinberg, pp.99\u2013100</ref>\n\n[[File:PSM V28 D454 Hallet point excavations and tunnel 7.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The excavations and tunnels used to undermine Hallert's Point]]\n\nWith the main shipping channels through The Narrows into the harbor silting up with sand due to [[Longshore drift|littoral drift]], thus providing ships with less depth, and a new generation of larger ships coming online \u2013 epitomized by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']], popularly known as \"Leviathan\" \u2013 New York began to be concerned that it would start to lose its status as a great port if a \"back door\" entrance into the harbor was not created.<ref>Steinberg, pp.105\u2013106</ref>  In the 1850s the depth continued to lessen \u2013 the harbor commission said in 1850 that the mean water low was {{convert|24|ft}} and the extreme water low was {{convert|23|ft}} \u2013 while the draft required by the new ships continued to increase, meaning it was only safe for them to enter the harbor at high tide.<ref>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), pp.94\u201395</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Congress, realizing that the problem needed to be addressed, appropriated $20,000 for the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] to continue Maillefert's work, but the money was soon spent without appreciable change in the hazards of navigating the strait.  An advisory council recommended in 1856 that the strait be cleared of all obstacles, but nothing was done, and the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] soon broke out.<ref name=concrete95>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), p.95</ref>\n\nIn the late 1860s, after the Civil War, Congress realized the military importance of having easily navigable waterways, and charged the Army Corps of Engineers with clearing Hell Gate of the rocks there that caused a danger to navigation. The Corps' Colonel James Newton estimated that the project would cost $1 million, as compared to the approximate annual loss in shipping of $2 million.  Initial forays floundered, and Newton, by that time a general, took over direct control of the project.<ref name=concrete95 />  In 1868 Newton decided, with the support of both New York's mercantile class and local real estate interests, to focus on the {{convert|3|acre|ha|adj=on}} Hallert's Point Reef off of Queens.  The project would involve {{convert| 7,000|ft}} of tunnels equipped with trains to haul debris out as the reef was eviscerated, creating a reef structured like \"swiss cheese\" which Newton would then blow up.  After seven years of digging seven thousand holes, and filling four thousand of them with {{convert|30000|lb}} of dynamite, on September 24, 1876, in front of an audience of people including the inhabitants of the insane asylum on Wards Island, but not the prisoners of Roosevelt Island \u2013 then called Blackwell's Island \u2013 who remained in their cells, Newton's daughter set off the explosion. The effect was immediate in decreased turbulence through the strait, and fewer accidents and shipwrecks.  The city's [[Chamber of commerce|Chamber of Commerce]] commented that \"The Centennial year will be for ever known in the annals of commerce for this destruction of one of the terrors of navigation.\"  Clearing out the debris from the explosion took until 1891.<ref name=fed420 /><ref name=wolfe /><ref name=\"Steinberg, pp.139, 142-43\">Steinberg, pp.139, 142\u201343</ref><ref>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), pp.95\u201396</ref>\n\nThen, in 1885, Flood Rock, a {{convert|9|acre|ha|adj=on}} reef that Newton had begun to undermine even before starting on Hallert's Rock, removing {{convert|8,000|cuyd}} of rock from the reef, was blown up as well, with Civil War General [[Philip Sheridan]] and abolitionist [[Henry Ward Beecher]] among those in attendance, and Newton's daughter once more setting off the blast, the biggest ever to that date, and reportedly the largest man-made explosion until the advent of the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]]<ref name=fed420 /><ref name=wolfe /><ref name=\"Steinberg, pp.139, 142-43\"/><ref name=Whitt>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE3D71631F931A35755C0A9609C8B63 |title=The East River is Cleaner Now.

Two years later, plans were in place to dredge Hell Gate to a consistent depth of {{convert|26|ft}}.<ref name=concrete96>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), p.96</ref>\n\nAt the same time that Hell Gate was being cleared, the [[Spuyten Duyvil Creek|Harlem River Ship Canal]] was being planned.  When it was completed in 1895, the \"back door\" to New York's center of ship-borne trade in the docks and warehouses of the East River was open from two directions, through the cleared East River, and from the Hudson River through the [[Harlem River]] to the East River.<ref>Steinberg, p.140</ref> Ironically, though, while both forks of the northern shipping entrance to the city were now open, modern dredging techniques had cut through the sandbars of the Atlantic Ocean entrance, allowing new, even larger ships to use that traditional passage into New York's docks.<ref name=concrete96 />\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, the East River was the center of New York's shipping industry, but by the end of the century, much of it had moved to the Hudson River, leaving the East River wharves and slips to begin a long process of decay, until the area was finally rehabilitated in the mid-1960s, and the [[South Street Seaport|South Street Seaport Museum]] was opened in 1967.<ref>{{cite naming|page=34}}</ref>\n\n===A new seawall===\nBy 1870, the condition of the Port of New York along both the East and Hudson Rivers had so deteriorated that the New York State legislature created the Department of Docks to renovate the port and keep New York competitive with other ports on the American East Coast.  The Department of Docks was given the task of creating the master plan for the waterfront, and General [[George B. McClellan]] was engaged to head the project.  McClellan held public hearings and invited plans to be submitted, ultimately receiving 70 of them, although in the end he and his successors put his own plan into effect.  That plan called for the building of a seawall around Manhattan island from [[List of numbered streets in Manhattan|West 61st Street]] on the Hudson, around [[The Battery (Manhattan)|The Battery]], and up to [[51st Street (Manhattan)|East 51st Street]] on the East River.  The area behind the masonry wall (mostly concrete but in some parts granite blocks) would be filled in with landfill, and wide streets would be laid down on the new land.  In this way, a new edge for the island (or at least the part of it used as a commercial port) would be created.<ref name=concrete184>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), pp.184\u2013186</ref>\n\nThe Department had surveyed {{convert|13,700|ft}} of shoreline by 1878, as well as documenting the currents and tides. By 1900, {{convert|75|mi}} had been surveyed and core samples had been taken to inform the builders of how deep the bedrock was. The work was completed just as [[World War I]] began, allowing the Port of New York to be a major point of embarkation for troops and materiel.<ref name=concrete184 />\n\nThe new seawall helps protect Manhattan island from storm surges, although it is only {{convert|5|ft}} above the mean sea level, so that particularly dangerous storms, such as the [[nor'easter]] of 1992 and [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012, which hit the city in a way to create surges which are much higher, can still do significant damage. (The Hurricane of September 3, 1831 created the biggest storm surge on record in New York City: a rise of {{convert|13|ft}} in one hour at the Battery, flooding all of lower Manhattan up to [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]].)  Still, the new seawall begun in 1871 gave the island a firmer edge, improved the quality of the port, and continues to protect Manhattan from normal storm surges.<ref name=concrete184 />\n\n===Bridges and tunnels===\n{{see also|#Crossings}}\nThe [[Brooklyn Bridge]], completed in 1883, was the first bridge to span the East River, connecting the cities of New York and [[Brooklyn]], and all but replacing the frequent ferry service between them, which did not return until the late 20th century.  The bridge offered [[cable car (railway)|cable car]] service across the span.  The Brooklyn Bridge was followed by the [[Williamsburg Bridge]] (1903), the [[Queensboro Bridge]] (1909), the [[Manhattan Bridge]] (1912) and the [[Hell Gate Bridge|Hell Gate Railroad Bridge]] (1916). Later would come the [[Triborough Bridge]] (1936), the [[Bronx\u2013Whitestone Bridge|Bronx-Whitestone Bridge]] (1939), the [[Throgs Neck Bridge]] (1961) and the [[Rikers Island|Rikers Island Bridge]] (1966).  In addition, numerous rail tunnels pass under the East River \u2013 most of them part of the [[New York City Subway]] system \u2013 as does the [[Brooklyn\u2013Battery Tunnel|Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel]] and the [[Queens\u2013Midtown Tunnel|Queens-Midtown Tunnel]]. (See [[#Crossings|Crossings]] below for details.)  Also under the river is Water Tunnel #1 of the [[New York City water supply system]], built in 1917 to extend the Manhattan portion of the tunnel to Brooklyn, and via City Tunnel #2 (1936) to Queens; these boroughs became part of New York City after the city's consolidation in 1898.<ref>Burrows and Wallace, p.1229</ref><ref name=\"water\">[[New York City Department of Environmental Protection]] [http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/dep_projects/cp_city_water_tunnel3.shtml \"City Water Tunnel #3\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401173724/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/dep_projects/cp_city_water_tunnel3.shtml |date=April 1, 2016 }}</ref> City Tunnel #3 will also run under the river, under the northern tip of Roosevelt Island, and is expected to be completed by 2018; the Manhattan portion of the tunnel went into service in 2013.<ref name=water />\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\nPhilanthropist [[John D.

The sewers terminated at the slips where ships docked, until the waste began to build up, preventing dockage, after which the outfalls were moved to the end of the piers.  The \"landfill\" which created new land along the shoreline when the river was \"wharfed out\" by the sale of \"water lots\" was largely garbage such as bones, offal, and even whole dead animals, along with excrement \u2013 human and animal.<ref>Steinberg, 23\u201328, ''passim''</ref><ref>Burrows and Wallace, p.185</ref>  The result was that by the 1850s, if not before, the East River, like the other waterways around the city, was undergoing the process of [[eutrophication]] where the increase in [[nitrogen]] from excrement and other sources led to a decrease in free [[oxygen]], which in turn led to an increase in [[phytoplankton]] such as [[algae]] and a decrease in other life forms, breaking the area's established food chain. The East River became very polluted, and its animal life decreased drastically.<ref>Steinberg, pp.118\u201319</ref>\n\nIn an earlier time, one person had described the transparency of the water: \"I remember the time, gentlemen, when you could go in twelve feet of water and you could see the pebbles on the bottom of this river.\"  As the water got more polluted, it darkened, underwater vegetation (such as [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizing]] [[seagrass]]) began dying, and as the seagrass beds declined, the many associated species of their ecosystems declined as well, contributing to the decline of the river. Also harmful was the general destruction of the once plentiful [[Oyster|oyster beds]] in the waters around the city,<ref group=notes>Oysters were so plentiful in New Amsterdam and early New York that they were considered to be food for the poor, although the rich also ate them in great numbers. They were sold in specialized \"oyster shops\" and by vendors on the street, some of which were paved with their shells. Pearl Street was named after the piles of oysters left there by the Native Americans of the area. \"Enjoy the oysters\" was often said to a person planning on traveling to New York City, so strong was the bivalve as an icon of the city. It was only after the collapse of the local oyster beds, by around 1920, that oysters became scarce, and a delicacy only affordable by the rich.{{parabr}}{{nb5}}Burrows and Wallace, pp.460, 798, 816<br>{{nb5}}Kurlansky, Mark \"oysters\" in {{cite enc-nyc2}}, pp.963\u2013964<br>{{nb5}}Steinberg, pp.7, 170\u201371</ref> and the over-fishing of [[menhaden]], or [[Menhaden|mossbunker]], a small silvery fish which had been used since the time of the Native Americans for fertilizing crops \u2013 however it took 8,000 of these schooling fish to fertilize a single acre, so mechanized fishing using the [[Seine fishing|purse seine]] was developed, and eventually the menhaden population collapsed.  Menhaden feed on phytoplankton, helping to keep them in check, and are also a vital step in the food chain, as [[bluefish]], [[striped bass]] and other fish species which do not eat phytoplankton feed on the menhaden.  The oyster is another filter feeder: oysters purify 10 to 100 gallons a day, while each menhaden filters four gallons in a minute, and their schools were immense: one report had a farmer collecting 20 oxcarts worth of menhaden using simple fishing nets deployed from the shore.  The combination of more sewage, due to the availability of more potable water \u2013 New York's water consumption ''per capita'' was twice that of Europe \u2013 indoor plumbing, the destruction of filter feeders, and the collapse of the food chain, damaged the ecosystem of the waters around New York, including the East River, almost beyond repair.<ref>Steinberg, pp.166\u201373</ref>\n\nBecause of these changes to the ecosystem, by 1909, the level of dissolved-oxygen in the lower part of the river had declined to less than 65%, where 55% of saturation is the point at which the amount of fish and the number of their species begins to be affected.<ref>Steinberg, pp.161, 163\u201364</ref> Only 17 years later, by 1926, the level of dissolved oxygen in the river had fallen to 13%, below the point at which most fish species can survive.<ref>Steinberg, p.177</ref>\n\n<!--The following information, right up to the 8/30/07 NY Times footnote, is covered by the source in that footnote.

[[Oviparity|laying]] of [[Eggshell|hard-shelled]] eggs, a high [[Metabolism|metabolic]] rate, a four-chambered [[heart]], and a strong yet lightweight [[Bird skeleton|skeleton]]. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the {{convert|5|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} [[bee hummingbird]] to the {{convert|2.75|m|ft|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} [[Common ostrich|ostrich]]. There are about ten thousand living species,<ref>Attenborough, D.1998 ''The Life of Birds''. BBC books. {{ISBN|0563 38792 0}}</ref> more than half of which are [[passerine]], or \"perching\" birds. Birds have {{Birdgloss|wings}} whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct [[moa]] and [[elephant bird]]s. Wings, which evolved from [[forelimb]]s, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including [[ratite]]s, [[penguin]]s, and diverse [[endemism|endemic]] island species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly [[seabird]]s and some [[Water bird|waterbirds]], have further evolved for swimming.\n\nBirds are a group of [[feathered dinosaur|feathered]] [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s, and constitute the [[Origin of birds|only living dinosaurs]], and thus are [[reptiles]]. Likewise, the closest living relatives of birds are the [[crocodilia]]ns. Birds are descendants of the primitive [[Avialae|avialans]] (whose members include ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'') which first appeared about 160 million years ago (mya) in China. According to DNA evidence, modern birds ('''Neornithes''') evolved in the [[Middle Cretaceous|Middle]] to [[Late Cretaceous]], and diversified dramatically around the time of the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]] 66 mya, which killed off the [[pterosaur]]s and all non-avian dinosaurs.\n\nMany [[social animal|social species]] pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered [[Animal culture#Examples of culturally transmitted behaviors in birds|a form of culture]]. Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and [[bird vocalization|songs]], and participating in such behaviours as [[helpers at the nest|cooperative breeding]] and hunting, [[Flocking (behavior)|flocking]], and [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|mobbing]] of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially (but not necessarily sexually) [[Monogamy in animals|monogamous]], usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species have breeding systems that are [[Polygyny in animals|polygynous]] (one male with many females) or, rarely, [[Polyandry in nature|polyandrous]] (one female with many males). Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through [[sexual reproduction]]. They are usually laid in a nest and [[Avian incubation|incubated]] by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching.\n\nMany species of birds are economically important as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing, with [[Poultry|domesticated]] and [[Game (hunting)|undomesticated]] birds being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers. [[Songbird]]s, parrots, and other species are popular as pets. [[Guano]] (bird excrement) is harvested for use as a fertiliser. Birds figure throughout human culture.

The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by [[atrioventricular valves]] which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium.\n\nThe [[sinoatrial node]] uses calcium to cause a [[Depolarization|depolarising]] [[signal transduction pathway]] from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles. The avian heart also consists of muscular arches that are made up of thick bundles of muscular layers. Much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of [[endocardial]], [[myocardial]] and [[epicardial]] layers.<ref name=Whittow /> The atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. Avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass. This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight.<ref name=\"Hoagstrom\">Hoagstrom, C.W. (2002). \"Vertebrate Circulation\".

Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo [[vasoconstriction]], and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body.<ref name=Hill>Hill, Richard W.

Blood travels through the arterioles and moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur.\n\nCapillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues; it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds, blood flow is slowed to allow maximum [[diffusion]] of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated, it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called [[vasodilation]] bringing blood back to the heart.<ref name=Hill /> Once the blood reaches the heart, it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen.

Helpless chicks are termed ''[[altricial]]'', and tend to be born small, [[Blindness|blind]], immobile and naked; chicks that are mobile and feathered upon hatching are termed ''[[precocial]]''. Altricial chicks need help [[thermoregulation|thermoregulating]] and must be brooded for longer than precocial chicks. The young of many bird species do not precisely fit into either the precocial or altricial category, having some aspects of each and thus fall somewhere on an \"altricial-precocial spectrum\".<ref name=\"Urfi2011\">{{cite book|last=Urfi|first=A.J.|title=The Painted Stork: Ecology and Conservation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_9tczTapYXMC&pg=PA88|year=2011|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4419-8468-5|page=88}}</ref> Chicks at neither extreme but favoring one or the other may be termed {{Birdgloss|semi-precocial}}<ref name=\"Khanna2005\">{{cite book|last=Khanna|first=D.R.|title=Biology of Birds|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fDblIChi7KwC&pg=PA109|year=2005|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7141-933-3|page=109}}</ref> or {{Birdgloss|semi-altricial}}.<ref name=\"Scott2008\">{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Lynnette|title=Wildlife Rehabilitation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FpAOAQAAMAAJ|year=2008|publisher=National Wildlife Rehabilitators Association|isbn=978-1-931439-23-7|page=50}}</ref>\n[[File:Calliope-nest edit.jpg|thumb|alt=Hummingbird perched on edge of tiny nest places food into mouth of one of two chicks|left|A female [[Calliope hummingbird]] feeding fully grown chicks.]]\n[[File:White-breasted Woodswallow chicks in nest.jpg|thumb|alt=Looking down on three helpless blind chicks in a nest within the hollow of a dead tree trunk|right|[[Altricial]] chicks of a [[white-breasted woodswallow]].]]\n\nThe length and nature of parental care varies widely amongst different orders and species.

[[Oviparity|laying]] of [[Eggshell|hard-shelled]] eggs, a high [[Metabolism|metabolic]] rate, a four-chambered [[heart]], and a strong yet lightweight [[Bird skeleton|skeleton]]. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the {{convert|5|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} [[bee hummingbird]] to the {{convert|2.75|m|ft|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} [[Common ostrich|ostrich]]. There are about ten thousand living species,<ref>Attenborough, D.1998 ''The Life of Birds''. BBC books. {{ISBN|0563 38792 0}}</ref> more than half of which are [[passerine]], or \"perching\" birds. Birds have {{Birdgloss|wings}} whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct [[moa]] and [[elephant bird]]s. Wings, which evolved from [[forelimb]]s, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including [[ratite]]s, [[penguin]]s, and diverse [[endemism|endemic]] island species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly [[seabird]]s and some [[Water bird|waterbirds]], have further evolved for swimming.\n\nBirds are a group of [[feathered dinosaur|feathered]] [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s, and constitute the [[Origin of birds|only living dinosaurs]], and thus are [[reptiles]]. Likewise, the closest living relatives of birds are the [[crocodilia]]ns. Birds are descendants of the primitive [[Avialae|avialans]] (whose members include ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'') which first appeared about 160 million years ago (mya) in China. According to DNA evidence, modern birds ('''Neornithes''') evolved in the [[Middle Cretaceous|Middle]] to [[Late Cretaceous]], and diversified dramatically around the time of the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]] 66 mya, which killed off the [[pterosaur]]s and all non-avian dinosaurs.\n\nMany [[social animal|social species]] pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered [[Animal_culture#Examples_of_culturally_transmitted_behaviors_in_birds|a form of culture]]. Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and [[bird vocalization|songs]], and participating in such behaviours as [[helpers at the nest|cooperative breeding]] and hunting, [[Flocking (behavior)|flocking]], and [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|mobbing]] of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially (but not necessarily sexually) [[Monogamy in animals|monogamous]], usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species have breeding systems that are [[Polygyny in animals|polygynous]] (one male with many females) or, rarely, [[Polyandry in nature|polyandrous]] (one female with many males). Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through [[sexual reproduction]]. They are usually laid in a nest and [[Avian incubation|incubated]] by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching.\n\nMany species of birds are economically important as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing, with [[Poultry|domesticated]] and [[Game (hunting)|undomesticated]] birds being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers. [[Songbird]]s, parrots, and other species are popular as pets. [[Guano]] (bird excrement) is harvested for use as a fertiliser. Birds figure throughout human culture. About 120 to 130 species have become [[Bird extinction|extinct]] due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them. Recreational [[birdwatching]] is an important part of the [[ecotourism]] industry.\n\n==Evolution and classification==\n{{Main|Evolution of birds}}\n[[File:Naturkundemuseum Berlin - Archaeopteryx - Eichst\u00e4tt.jpg|alt= Slab of stone with fossil bones and feather impressions|thumb|right|''[[Archaeopteryx lithographica]]'' is often considered the oldest known true bird.]]\nThe first [[biological classification|classification]] of birds was developed by [[Francis Willughby]] and [[John Ray]] in their 1676 volume ''Ornithologiae''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=del Hoyo |first=Josep |author2=Andy Elliott|author3=Jordi Sargatal |title=Handbook of Birds of the World, Volume 1: Ostrich to Ducks |year=1992 |publisher=[[Lynx Edicions]] |location=Barcelona |isbn=84-87334-10-5}}</ref>\n[[Carl Linnaeus]] modified that work in 1758 to devise the [[taxonomic classification]] system currently in use.<ref>\n{{Cite book|last=Linnaeus |first=Carolus |authorlink=Carl Linnaeus |title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by [[atrioventricular valves]] which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium.\n\nThe [[sinoatrial node]] uses calcium to cause a [[Depolarization|depolarising]] [[signal transduction pathway]] from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles. The avian heart also consists of muscular arches that are made up of thick bundles of muscular layers. Much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of [[endocardial]], [[myocardial]] and [[epicardial]] layers.<ref name=Whittow /> The atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. Avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass. This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight.<ref name=\"Hoagstrom\">Hoagstrom, C.W. (2002). \"Vertebrate Circulation\".

Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo [[vasoconstriction]], and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body.<ref name=Hill>Hill, Richard W.

Blood travels through the arterioles and moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur.\n\nCapillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues; it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds, blood flow is slowed to allow maximum [[diffusion]] of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated, it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called [[vasodilation]] bringing blood back to the heart.<ref name=Hill /> Once the blood reaches the heart, it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen.

Helpless chicks are termed ''[[altricial]]'', and tend to be born small, [[Blindness|blind]], immobile and naked; chicks that are mobile and feathered upon hatching are termed ''[[precocial]]''. Altricial chicks need help [[thermoregulation|thermoregulating]] and must be brooded for longer than precocial chicks. The young of many bird species do not precisely fit into either the precocial or altricial category, having some aspects of each and thus fall somewhere on an \"altricial-precocial spectrum\".<ref name=\"Urfi2011\">{{cite book|last=Urfi|first=A.J.|title=The Painted Stork: Ecology and Conservation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_9tczTapYXMC&pg=PA88|year=2011|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4419-8468-5|page=88}}</ref> Chicks at neither extreme but favoring one or the other may be termed {{Birdgloss|semi-precocial}}<ref name=\"Khanna2005\">{{cite book|last=Khanna|first=D.R.|title=Biology of Birds|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fDblIChi7KwC&pg=PA109|year=2005|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7141-933-3|page=109}}</ref> or {{Birdgloss|semi-altricial}}.<ref name=\"Scott2008\">{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Lynnette|title=Wildlife Rehabilitation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FpAOAQAAMAAJ|year=2008|publisher=National Wildlife Rehabilitators Association|isbn=978-1-931439-23-7|page=50}}</ref>\n[[File:Calliope-nest edit.jpg|thumb|alt=Hummingbird perched on edge of tiny nest places food into mouth of one of two chicks|left|A female [[Calliope hummingbird]] feeding fully grown chicks.]]\n[[File:White-breasted Woodswallow chicks in nest.jpg|thumb|alt=Looking down on three helpless blind chicks in a nest within the hollow of a dead tree trunk|right|[[Altricial]] chicks of a [[white-breasted woodswallow]].]]\n\nThe length and nature of parental care varies widely amongst different orders and species.

He was known especially for his war poetry, but also wrote novels, short stories and children's fiction (including the Hartwarp books). Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor. However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle|News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse. <ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev.

'Parton Street Bookshop' in ''Pen Pusher'']</ref> Pudney also wrote for [[The Listener]], and as a producer at the BBC, where he produced the radio play ''Hadrian's Wall'' with text by Auden and music by Britten, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 25 November 1937.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IMFZ8a8aNHUC&pg=PT116&lpg=PT116&dq=John+Pudney+Benjamin+Britten&source=bl&ots=MUhRGApbmp&sig=ACfU3U2b1caNszL8RMuBi3jjBlRlW4z0Lw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8-c67k8zoAhUJesAKHRsaDzIQ6AEwCXoECAsQOA#v=onepage&q=John%20Pudney%20Benjamin%20Britten&f=false Warden, C.

During the 1930s he moved on from journalism and poetry to publishing novels and collections of short stories. However, it was the advent of the [[Second World War]] that enabled Pudney to find his subject - the effect that war has on the lives of ordinary people - and with it, his audience.<ref name=times>''The Times'' obituary, 11 November 1977, p 17</ref> In 1940 he was commissioned into the [[Royal Air Force]] as an intelligence officer and as a member of the [[Air Ministry]]'s Creative Writers Unit. It was while he was serving as squadron intelligence officer at [[RAF St Eval]] in Cornwall that Pudney wrote one of the best-known poems of the war.<ref name=dnb/> ''For Johnny'' evoked popular fellow-feeling in the London of 1941. Written during an air raid, it was published first in the ''News Chronicle'', and featured significantly in the film ''[[The Way to the Stars]]'':\n\n<poem>\nDo not despair\nFor Johnny-head-in-air;\nHe sleeps as sound\nAs Johnny underground.\n\nFetch out no shroud\nFor Johnny-in-the-cloud;\nAnd keep your tears\nFor him in after years.\n\nBetter by far\nFor Johnny-the-bright-star,\nTo keep your head,\nAnd see his children fed.\n</poem>\n\n==Later Career==\nIn the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|UK General Election of July 1945]], Pudney stood as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate for [[Sevenoaks (UK Parliament constituency)|Sevenoaks]], polling 14,947 votes, or 36 per cent.<ref>''The International Who's Who'' (Europa Publications Limited, 1963) p. 857</ref><ref>[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge45/i17.htm UK General Election results July 1945] at keele.ac.uk, accessed 10 January 2009</ref>\n\nAfter the war he continued to write and worked as an [[editing|editor]], as a director of magazines and publishing companies. He was with the ''[[News Review]]'' from 1948 to 1950, and as a director and literary adviser at the publishing houses Evans Brothers, Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). In 1953 he wrote the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award. His later poetry, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967) took on a more ironic stance, but still vernacular rather than academic. Of his novels, ''The Net'' (1952, set in an aeronautical research station) and ''Thin Air'' (1961) were well received.<ref name=times/> Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''.\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married Crystal Selwyn Herbert,<ref>[http://www.warpoets.org/conflicts/ww2/pudney/ John Pudney (1909 - 1977) - The War Poets Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417054114/http://www.warpoets.org/conflicts/ww2/pudney/ |date=17 April 2013 }}</ref> the daughter of [[A.

He was known especially for his war poetry, but also wrote novels, short stories and children's fiction (including the Hartwarp books). Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor. However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle|News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse. <ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev.

During the 1930s he moved on from journalism and poetry to publishing novels and collections of short stories. However, it was the advent of the [[Second World War]] that enabled Pudney to find his subject - the effect that war has on the lives of ordinary people - and with it, his audience.<ref name=times>''The Times'' obituary, 11 November 1977, p 17</ref> In 1940 he was commissioned into the [[Royal Air Force]] as an intelligence officer and as a member of the [[Air Ministry]]'s Creative Writers Unit. It was while he was serving as squadron intelligence officer at [[RAF St Eval]] in Cornwall that Pudney wrote one of the best-known poems of the war.<ref name=dnb/> ''For Johnny'' evoked popular fellow-feeling in the London of 1941. Written during an air raid, it was published first in the ''News Chronicle'', and featured significantly in the film ''[[The Way to the Stars]]'':\n\n<poem>\nDo not despair\nFor Johnny-head-in-air;\nHe sleeps as sound\nAs Johnny underground.\n\nFetch out no shroud\nFor Johnny-in-the-cloud;\nAnd keep your tears\nFor him in after years.\n\nBetter by far\nFor Johnny-the-bright-star,\nTo keep your head,\nAnd see his children fed.\n</poem>\n\n==Later Career==\nIn the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|UK General Election of July 1945]], Pudney stood as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate for [[Sevenoaks (UK Parliament constituency)|Sevenoaks]], polling 14,947 votes, or 36 per cent.<ref>''The International Who's Who'' (Europa Publications Limited, 1963) p. 857</ref><ref>[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge45/i17.htm UK General Election results July 1945] at keele.ac.uk, accessed 10 January 2009</ref>\n\nAfter the war he continued to write and worked as an [[editing|editor]], as a director of magazines and publishing companies. He was with the ''[[News Review]]'' from 1948 to 1950, and as a director and literary adviser at the publishing houses Evans Brothers, Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). In 1953 he wrote the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award. His later poetry, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967) took on a more ironic stance, but still vernacular rather than academic. Of his novels, ''The Net'' (1952, set in an aeronautical research station) and ''Thin Air'' (1961) were well received.<ref name=times/> Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''.\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married Crystal Selwyn Herbert,<ref>[http://www.warpoets.org/conflicts/ww2/pudney/ John Pudney (1909 - 1977) - The War Poets Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417054114/http://www.warpoets.org/conflicts/ww2/pudney/ |date=17 April 2013 }}</ref> the daughter of [[A.

He was referred to by Rabbi [[Menachem Meiri]] as the \"greatest Jewish leader of ''Zarfat'' ([[Medieval Hebrew]] for France, a reference to [[Charlemagne]]'s rule of Germany)\" alive at the time.\n\n==Biography==\n\nRabbi Meir was born between 1215 and 1220 in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]. He came from a long line of rabbis. His first teacher was his father. He continued his training in [[W\u00fcrzburg]] under [[Isaac ben Moses of Vienna]] and in [[France]], where he remained until 1242, his teachers being [[Yechiel of Paris]], [[Samuel ben Solomon of Falaise]], and [[Samuel of \u00c9vreux]], witnessing the [[Disputation of Paris#Outcome|burning of the Talmud]] on June 17, 1244, in [[Paris]]. He then settled in [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber]], opening a [[yeshiva]] in his house. After the death of his father in 1281, he settled in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]. In 1286, King [[Rudolf I of Germany|Rudolf I]] instituted a new political status for the Jewish community, declaring them ''servi camerae'' (\"serfs of the treasury\"), allowing direct royal taxation of the Jewish community. Since Rudolf did not prohibit local nobles from also taxing the Jews, the burden on the communities could be devastating. Along with many others, Meir left Germany with family and followers, but was captured in the mountains of [[Lombardy]] having been recognized by a baptized Jew named Kneppe,  and imprisoned in a fortress near [[Ensisheim]] in [[Alsace]]. Tradition has it that a large ransom of 23,000 [[Mark (weight)|marks]] silver was raised for him (by [[Asher ben Jehiel|the Rosh]]), but Rabbi Meir refused it, for fear of encouraging the imprisonment of other rabbis.  He ruled on his own abduction in light of Talmudic law.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McManus|first1=Shani|title=Responding to terror explored|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/florida-jewish-journal/news/palm/fl-jjpn-school-0715-20150713-story.html|agency=South Florida Sun-Sentinel|date=July 13, 2015|quote=The Jewish people have experienced similar situations throughout our arduous history,\" Rabbi Zalman Abraham of JLI headquarters in New York noted. \"When Rabbi Meir of Rothenberg was imprisoned for ransom in the Middle Ages, he ruled on his own abduction in light of Talmudic law.\"}}</ref> He died in prison after seven years.

His disciple the Rosh (Rabbi [[Asher ben Jehiel]]) codified much of his teaching.\n\n*His ''responsa'' are of great importance to advanced students of the Talmud, as well as to students of Jewish life and customs of those days, especially for the picture which they give of the condition of the German Jews, and of their sufferings from the caprice of princes and from heavy taxation.

He was referred to as the \"greatest Jewish leader of Zarfat ([[Medieval Hebrew]] for France which was a reference to Charlemagne's rule of Germany)\" alive at the time by Rabbi [[Menachem Meiri]].\n\n==Biography==\n\nRabbi Meir was born between 1215 and 1220 in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]. He came from a long line of rabbis. His first teacher was his father. He continued his training in [[W\u00fcrzburg]] under [[Isaac ben Moses of Vienna]] and in [[France]], where he remained until 1242, his teachers being [[Yechiel of Paris]], [[Samuel ben Solomon of Falaise]], and [[Samuel of \u00c9vreux]], witnessing the [[Disputation of Paris#Outcome|burning of the Talmud]] on June 17, 1244, in [[Paris]]. He then settled in [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber]], opening a [[yeshiva]] in his house. After the death of his father in 1281, he settled in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]. In 1286, King [[Rudolf I of Germany|Rudolf I]] instituted a new political status for the Jewish community, declaring them ''servi camerae'' (\"serfs of the treasury\"), allowing direct royal taxation of the Jewish community. Since Rudolf did not prohibit local nobles from also taxing the Jews, the burden on the communities could be devastating. Along with many others, Meir left Germany with family and followers, but was captured in the mountains of [[Lombardy]] having been recognized by a baptized Jew named Kneppe,  and imprisoned in a fortress near [[Ensisheim]] in [[Alsace]]. Tradition has it that a large ransom of 23,000 [[Mark (weight)|marks]] silver was raised for him (by [[Asher ben Jehiel|the Rosh]]), but Rabbi Meir refused it, for fear of encouraging the imprisonment of other rabbis.  He ruled on his own abduction in light of Talmudic law.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McManus|first1=Shani|title=Responding to terror explored|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/florida-jewish-journal/news/palm/fl-jjpn-school-0715-20150713-story.html|agency=South Florida Sun-Sentinel|date=July 13, 2015|quote=The Jewish people have experienced similar situations throughout our arduous history,\" Rabbi Zalman Abraham of JLI headquarters in New York noted. \"When Rabbi Meir of Rothenberg was imprisoned for ransom in the Middle Ages, he ruled on his own abduction in light of Talmudic law.\"}}</ref> He died in prison after seven years. Fourteen years after his death a ransom was paid for his body by Alexander ben Salomon Wimpfen, who was subsequently laid to rest beside the Maharam in the [[Jewish Cemetery, Worms|Jewish cemetery of Worms]].<ref>http://www.chabad.org/calendar/view/day.asp?id=265714&tDate=3/4/2006#265714</ref>\n\nAccording to Rabbi [[Chaim Joseph David Azulai]]'s ''Shem HaGedolim'',<ref>Chaim Joseph David Azulai, ''Shem HaGedolim'' (vol. 2), Livorno 1786, s.v. \u05d4\u05d2\u05d4\u05d5\u05ea \u05de\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea (Hebrew)</ref> a disciple of Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg, whose name was Rabbi [[Meir HaKohen|Meir HaCohen]], wrote the famous commentary on Maimonides' [[Mishneh Torah]], entitled ''Hagahot Maimoniyot''.\n\n==Works==\nRabbi Meir wrote no single major work, but many notes, commentaries, expositions, and poems\u2014as well as 1,500 ''[[responsa]].'' His disciple the Rosh (Rabbi [[Asher ben Jehiel]]) codified much of his teaching.\n\n*His ''responsa'' are of great importance to advanced students of the Talmud, as well as to students of Jewish life and customs of those days, especially for the picture which they give of the condition of the German Jews, and of their sufferings from the caprice of princes and from heavy taxation.
