Initially Eno did not appear on stage at their live shows, but operated the [[mixing console|mixing desk]], processing the band's sound with a [[VCS3]] synthesiser and tape recorders, and singing [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]]. He did, however, eventually appear on stage as a performing member of the group, usually flamboyantly costumed.

''Tiger Mountain'' contains the galloping \"Third Uncle\", one of Eno's best-known songs, owing in part to its later being covered by [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] and [[801 (band)|801]]. Critic [[Dave Thompson (author)|Dave Thompson]] writes that the song is \"a near punk attack of riffing guitars and clattering percussion, 'Third Uncle' could, in other hands, be a heavy metal anthem, albeit one whose lyrical content would tongue-tie the most slavish air guitarist.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Dave |url={{AllMusic|class=song|id=t821132|pure_url=yes}} |title=All Music review |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nThese four albums were remastered and reissued in 2004 by [[Virgin Records|Virgin]]'s [[Astralwerks]] label. Due to Eno's decision not to add any extra tracks of the original material, a handful of tracks originally issued as singles have not been reissued, including the single mix of \"King's Lead Hat\", the title of which is an [[anagram]] of \"[[Talking Heads]]\", whilst \"Seven Deadly Finns\" and \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\" were included on the [[Deletion (music industry)|deleted]] ''Eno Box II: Vocal''.\n\nDuring this period, Eno also played three dates with [[Phil Manzanera]] in the band [[801 (band)|801]], a \"[[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]]\" that performed more or less reworked selections from albums by Eno, Manzanera, and [[Quiet Sun (band)|Quiet Sun]], as well as covers of songs by [[The Beatles]] (\"[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]\") and [[The Kinks]] (\"[[You Really Got Me]]\").\n\nIn 1967, Eno developed a [[delay (audio effect)|tape delay]] system. The technique involved two [[Revox]] tape recorders set up side by side, with the tape unspooling from the first deck being carried over to the second deck to be spooled.  This enabled sound recorded on the first deck to be played back by the second deck at a time delay that varied with the distance between the two decks and the speed of the tape (typically a few seconds). Working with [[Robert Fripp]] (from [[King Crimson]]) the pair used this system in their collaboration ''[[(No Pussyfooting)]]'' (1973).<ref name=\"BBCEquatorialStars\">{{cite web|title = BBC \u2013 Experimental Review \u2013 Fripp Eno, The Equatorial Stars | publisher = BBC| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/qqzf/ |date=5 July 2004|author=Marsh, Peter|accessdate = 8 June 2008 }}</ref> Subsequently, Fripp referred to this method as \"[[Frippertronics]]\". In 1975, Fripp and Eno released a second album, ''[[Evening Star (Fripp & Eno album)|Evening Star]]'', and played several live shows in Europe.\n\nEno was a prominent member of the performance art-classical orchestra the [[Portsmouth Sinfonia]]&nbsp;\u2013 having started playing clarinet with them in 1972. In 1973, he produced the orchestra's first album ''The Portsmouth Sinfonia Plays the Popular Classics'' (released in March 1974) and in 1974, he produced the live album ''Hallelujah! The Portsmouth Sinfonia Live at the Royal Albert Hall'', a recording of their infamous May 1974 concert (released in October 1974). In addition to producing both albums, Eno performed in the orchestra on both recordings playing the clarinet. Eno also deployed the orchestra's famously dissonant string section on his second solo album ''Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)''. The orchestra at this time included other musicians whose solo work he would subsequently release on his Obscure label including [[Gavin Bryars]] and [[Michael Nyman]]. That year he also composed music for the album ''[[Lady June's Linguistic Leprosy]]'', with [[Kevin Ayers]], to accompany the poet [[Lady June|June Campbell Cramer]].\n\n==== Ambient music ====\n{{Main|Ambient music}}\nEno released a number of eclectic ambient electronic and acoustic albums. He coined the term \"ambient music\",<ref>{Prendergast, ''The Ambient Century'': p.93}</ref> which is designed to modify the listener's perception of the surrounding environment. In the liner notes accompanying [[Ambient 1: Music for Airports|''Ambient 1: Music for Airports'']], Eno wrote: \"Ambient music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular, it must be as ignorable as it is interesting.\"<ref>{(PVC7908(AMB001)}</ref>\n\nEno was hit by a taxi while crossing the street in January 1975 and spent several weeks recuperating at home. His girlfriend brought him an old record of harp music, which he lay down to listen to. He realized that he had set the amplifier to a very low volume, and one channel of the stereo was not working, but he lacked the energy to get up and correct it. \"This presented what was for me a new way of hearing music \u2013 as part of the ambience of the environment just as the colour of the light and sound of the rain were parts of the ambience.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/how-brian-eno-created-a-quiet-revolution-in-music/|title=How Brian Eno created a quiet revolution in music|work=The Telegraph|access-date=21 October 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nEno's first work of ambient music was ''[[Discreet Music]]'' (1975), again created with an elaborate tape-delay methodology which he diagrammed on the back cover of the LP; it is considered the landmark album of the genre. This was followed by his ''Ambient'' series: ''[[Music for Airports]] (Ambient 1)'', ''[[The Plateaux of Mirror]] (Ambient 2)'' featuring Harold Budd on keyboard, ''[[Day of Radiance]] (Ambient 3)'' with American composer [[Laraaji]] playing zither and hammered dulcimer, and ''[[On Land]] (Ambient 4)'').\n\n===1980s===\n\nIn 1980, Eno provided a film score for [[Herbert Vesely]]'s ''[[Egon Schiele \u2013 Exzess und Bestrafung]]'', also known as ''Egon Schiele \u2013 Excess and Punishment''. The ambient-style score was an unusual choice for an historical piece, but it worked effectively with the film's themes of sexual obsession and death.\n\nBefore Eno made ''On Land,'' [[Robert Quine]] played him [[Miles Davis]]' \"[[Get Up With It|He Loved Him Madly]]\" (1974). Eno stated in the liner notes for ''On Land,'' \"Teo Macero's revolutionary production on that piece seemed to me to have the \"spacious\" quality I was after, and like Federico Fellini's 1973 film ''Amarcord'', it too became a touchstone to which I returned frequently.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/onland-txt.html |title=''Ambient 4: On Land'' 1986 release notes |publisher=Music.hyperreal.org |accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980 to 1981, during which time Eno travelled to [[Ghana]] for a festival of West African music, he was collaborating with [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]] of [[Talking Heads]]. Their album [[My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (album)|''My Life in the Bush of Ghosts'']], was built around radio broadcasts Eno collected whilst living in the [[United States]], along with sampled music recordings from around the world transposed over music predominantly inspired by African and [[Middle East]]ern rhythms.\n\nIn 1983, Eno collaborated with his brother, [[Roger Eno]], and [[Daniel Lanois]] on the album ''[[Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks]]'' that had been commissioned by Al Reinert for his film ''[[For All Mankind]]'' (1989).<ref>{{cite news|first1=John L.|last1=Walters|accessdate=2019-08-10|title=Pop review: Brian Eno's Apollo|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/22/brian-eno-apollo-review|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=22 July 2009|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|accessdate=2019-08-10|title=Brian Eno explains Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jul/08/apollo-11-moon-brian-eno|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=8 July 2009|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Tracks from the album were subsequently used in several other films, including ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951/soundtrack|title=Trainspotting (1996)|accessdate=16 January 2018|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nIn September 1992, Eno released ''[[Nerve Net]]'', an album utilising heavily syncopated rhythms with contributions from several former collaborators including Fripp, [[Benmont Tench]], [[Robert Quine]] and [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]]. This album was a last-minute substitution for ''My Squelchy Life'', which contained more pop oriented material, with Eno on vocals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20032-brian-eno-nerve-netthe-shutov-assemblynerolithe-drop/|title=Brian Eno: Nerve Net/The Shutov Assembly/Neroli/The Drop Album Review - Pitchfork|website=Pitchfork.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref> Several tracks from ''My Squelchy Life'' later appeared on 1993's retrospective box set ''Eno Box II: Vocals,'' and the entire album was eventually released in 2014 as part of an expanded re-release of ''Nerve Net.'' Eno also released ''[[The Shutov Assembly]]'' in 1992, recorded between 1985 and 1990. This album embraces [[atonality]] and abandons most conventional concepts of [[Mode (music)|modes]], [[Scale (music)|scales]] and [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]. Emancipated from the constant attraction towards the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] that underpins the Western [[tonal music|tonal tradition]], the gradually shifting music originally eschewed any conventional instrumentation, save for treated keyboards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/interviews/me_intr3.html#q2|title=Brian Eno interviewed by Michael Engelbrecht|website=Music.hyperreal.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=May 2019}}\n\nDuring the 1990s, Eno worked increasingly with self-generating musical systems, the results of which he called [[generative music]]. This allows the listener to hear music that slowly unfolds in almost infinite non-repeating combinations of sound.<ref>The Cambridge Companion to Electronic Music pp118-119 Ed. Nick Collins ({{ISBN|9780521688659}})</ref> In one instance of generative music, Eno calculated that it would take almost 10,000 years to hear the entire possibilities of one individual piece. Eno achieves this through the blending of several independent musical tracks of varying length. Each track features different musical elements and in some cases, silence. When each individual track concludes, it starts again re-configuring differently with the other tracks. He has presented this music in his own art and sound installations and those in collaboration with other artists, including ''[[I Dormienti]] (The Sleepers)'', ''[[Lightness: Music for the Marble Palace \u2013 The State Russian Museum, St. Petersburg|Lightness: Music for the Marble Palace]],'' ''[[Music for Civic Recovery Centre]],'' ''[[The Quiet Room]],'' and ''Music for Prague.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/the-long-now-foundation/music-time-and-long-term-thinking-brian-eno-expands-the-vocabulary-of-human-feeling-98e0fbad5950|title=Brian Eno Expands the Vocabulary of Human Feeling|first=The Long Now|last=Foundation|date=30 November 2017|website=Medium.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nOne of Eno's better-known collaborations was with the members of [[U2]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]] and several other artists in a group called Passengers. They produced the 1995 album ''[[Original Soundtracks 1]],'' which reached No. 76 on the US [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] and No. 12 in the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It featured a single, \"[[Miss Sarajevo]]\", which reached number 6 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/miss%20sarajevo/|title=miss+sarajevo {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|access-date=18 January 2017}}</ref> This collaboration is chronicled in Eno's book ''[[A Year with Swollen Appendices]],'' a diary published in 1996.\n\nIn 1996, Eno scored the six-part fantasy television series ''[[Neverwhere]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115288/fullcredits|title=Neverwhere (TV Mini-Series 1996\u2013 )|accessdate=8 December 2017|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2004, Fripp and Eno recorded another ambient music collaboration album, ''[[The Equatorial Stars]]''.\n\nEno returned in June 2005 with ''[[Another Day on Earth]]'', his first major album since ''[[Wrong Way Up]]'' (with [[John Cale]]) to prominently feature vocals (a trend he continued with ''[[Everything That Happens Will Happen Today]]''). The album differs from his 1970s solo work due to the impact technological advances on musical production, evident in its semi-electronic production.\n\nIn early 2006, Eno collaborated with David Byrne again, for the reissue of ''My Life in the Bush of Ghosts'' in celebration of the influential album's 25th anniversary. Eight previously unreleased tracks recorded during the initial sessions in 1980/81, were added to the album.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6382-david-byrne/\n| title = Interview: David Byrne\n| last = Dahlen\n| first = Chris\n| date = 17 July 2006\n| work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]}}</ref>\nAn unusual interactive marketing strategy was employed for its re-release, the album's promotional website features the ability for anyone to officially and legally download the [[multitrack recording|multi-tracks]] of two songs from the album, \"A Secret Life\" and \"Help Me Somebody\". This allowed listeners to [[remix]] and upload new mixes of these tracks to the website for others to listen and rate them.\n\n[[File:Brian Eno Profile Long Now Foundation 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Eno at the [[Long Now Foundation]], 26 June 2006]]\nIn late 2006, Eno released ''[[77 Million Paintings]]'', a program of generative video and music specifically for home computers. As its title suggests, there is a possible combination of 77 million paintings where the viewer will see different combinations of video slides prepared by Eno each time the program is launched.

In the past we saw the universe as a perfect, divine creation \u2013 logical, finite, deterministic \u2013 and our art reflected that.

He also produced part of the 1993 album ''[[When I Was a Boy]]'' by [[Jane Siberry]]. He won the best producer award at the 1994 and 1996 [[BRIT Awards]].\n\nEno describes himself as a \"non-musician\", using the term \"treatments\" to describe his modification of the sound of musical instruments, and to separate his role from that of the traditional instrumentalist. His skill at using \"The Studio as a Compositional Tool\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/interviews/downbeat79.htm |title=Pro Session&nbsp;\u2013 The Studio as Compositional Tool |publisher=Music.hyperreal.org |accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref> (the title of an essay by Eno) led in part to his career as a producer. His methods were recognised at the time (mid-1970s) as unique, so much so that on [[Genesis (band)|Genesis's]] ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'', he is credited with 'Enossification'; on [[Robert Wyatt]]'s ''[[Ruth Is Stranger Than Richard]]'' with a ''Direct inject anti-jazz raygun'' and on [[John Cale]]'s [[Island Records|Island]] albums as simply being \"Eno\".\n\nEno has contributed to recordings by artists as varied as [[Nico]], Robert Calvert, [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[David Bowie]], and [[Zvuki Mu]], in various capacities such as use of his studio/synthesiser/electronic treatments, vocals, guitar, bass guitar, and as just being 'Eno'. In 1984, he (amongst others) composed and performed the \"Prophecy Theme\" for the [[David Lynch]] film ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]''; the rest of the [[Dune (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] was composed and performed by the group [[Toto (band)|Toto]]. Eno produced performance artist [[Laurie Anderson (performance artist)|Laurie Anderson]]'s ''[[Bright Red]]'' album, and also composed for it. The work is avant-garde spoken word with haunting and magnifying sounds. Eno played on David Byrne's musical score for ''The Catherine Wheel'', a project commissioned by [[Twyla Tharp]] to accompany her Broadway dance project of the same name.\n\nHe worked with Bowie as a writer and musician on Bowie's influential 1977\u201379 'Berlin Trilogy' of albums, ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]], [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|\"Heroes\"]]'' and ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'', on Bowie's later album ''[[Outside (David Bowie album)|Outside]]'', and on the song \"[[I'm Afraid of Americans]]\". Recorded in France and Germany, the spacey effects on ''Low'' were largely created by Eno, who played a portable [[EMS Synthi A]] synthesizer.

In 1995, U2 and Eno joined forces to create the album ''[[Original Soundtracks 1]]'' under the group name Passengers; songs from which included \"[[Your Blue Room]]\" and \"[[Miss Sarajevo]]\".  Even though films are listed and described for each song, all but three are bogus. Eno also produced ''[[Laid (album)|Laid]]'' (1993), ''[[Wah Wah (album)|Wah Wah]]'' (1994) ''[[Millionaires (album)|Millionaires]]'' (1999) and ''[[Pleased to Meet You (James album)|Pleased to Meet You]]'' (2001) for [[James (band)|James]], performing as an extra musician on all four. He is credited for \"frequent interference and occasional co-production\" on their 1997 album ''[[Whiplash (album)|Whiplash]]''.\n\nEno played on the 1986 album ''[[Measure for Measure (album)|Measure for Measure]]'' by Australian band [[Icehouse (band)|Icehouse]].

In 1995, Eno provided one of several remixes of \"[[Protection (Massive Attack song)|Protection]]\" by [[Massive Attack]] (originally from their ''[[Protection (Massive Attack album)|Protection]]'' album) for release as a single.\n\nIn 2007, he produced the fourth studio album by [[Coldplay]], ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends]]'', released in 2008. Also in 2008, he worked with [[Grace Jones]] on her album ''[[Hurricane (Grace Jones album)|Hurricane]]'', credited for \"production consultation\" and as a member of the band, playing keyboards, treatments and background vocals. He worked on the twelfth studio album by [[U2]], again with Lanois, titled ''[[No Line on the Horizon]]''. It was recorded in Morocco, the South of France and [[Dublin]] and released in Europe on 27 February 2009.\n\nIn 2011, Eno and Coldplay reunited and Eno contributed \"enoxification\" and additional composition on Coldplay's fifth studio album ''[[Mylo Xyloto]]'', released on 24 October of that year.\n\n[[File:Brian Eno's musical web.jpg|thumb|Eno's connections to other progressive rock music artists]]\n\n===The Microsoft Sound===\nIn 1994, [[Microsoft]] designers [[Mark Malamud]] and Erik Gavriluk approached Eno to compose music for the [[Windows 95]] project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minyanville.com/businessmarkets/articles/intel-microsoft-research-in-motion-apple/5/25/2010/id/28465?refresh=1|title=Who Created The Windows Start-Up Sound?|last=Rohrlich|first=Justin|date=25 May 2010|work=[[Minyanville]]'s Wall Street|accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref> The result was the six-second [[Booting|start-up]] music-sound of the Windows 95 [[operating system]], \"The Microsoft Sound\".

I was so sensitive to microseconds at the end of this that it really broke a logjam in my own work.

He started experimenting with the medium of video in 1978. Eno describes the first video camera he received, which would initially become his main tool for creating ambient video and light installations:\n\n\"One afternoon while I was working in the studio with [[Talking Heads]], the roadie from [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], working in an adjacent studio, came in and asked whether anyone wanted to buy some video equipment. I'd never really thought much about video, and found most 'video art' completely unmemorable, but the prospect of actually owning a video camera was, at that time, quite exotic.\"<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). ''77 Million Paintings'' \"My Light Years\". pp. 2.</ref>\n\nThe [[Panasonic]] industrial camera Eno received had significant [[design flaws]] preventing the camera from sitting upright without the assistance of a tripod. This led to his works being filmed in vertical format, requiring the television set to be flipped on its side to view it in the proper orientation.<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). \"My Light Years\". pp. 2.</ref> The pieces Eno produced with this method, such as ''Mistaken Memories of Mediaeval Manhattan'' (1980) and ''[[Thursday Afternoon]]'' (1984) (accompanied by the album of the same title), were labelled as 'Video Paintings.' He explained the genre title in the music magazine NME:\n\n\"I was delighted to find this other way of using video because at last here's video which draws from another source, which is painting&nbsp;... I call them 'video paintings' because if you say to people 'I make videos', they think of Sting's new rock video or some really boring, grimy 'Video Art'. It's just a way of saying, 'I make videos that don't move very fast.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/interviews/nme85.html#Thursday |title=NME: Proxy Music |publisher=Music.hyperreal.org |date=9 November 1985 |accessdate=14 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nThese works presented Eno with the opportunity to expand his ambient aesthetic into a visual form, manipulating the medium of video to produce something not present in the normal television experience. His video works were shown around the world in exhibitions in New York and Tokyo, as well as released on the compilation 14 Video Paintings in 2005.<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). \"My Light Years\". pp. 5.</ref>\n\nEno continued his video experimentation through the 80s, 90s and 2000s, leading to further experimentation with the television as a malleable light source and informing his generative works such as [[77 Million Paintings]] in 2006.<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). \"My Light Years\". pp. 6\u20138.</ref>\n\n===Generative music===\nEno gives the example of [[wind chime]]s. He says that these systems and the creation of them have been a focus of his since he was a student: \"I got interested in the idea of music that could make itself, in a sense, in the mid 1960s really, when I first heard composers like [[Terry Riley]], and when I first started playing with tape recorders.\"\n<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/appsblog/2012/sep/26/brian-eno-scape-ipad-apps|title=Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers talk Scape, iPad apps and generative music|first=Stuart|last=Dredge|date=26 September 2012|accessdate=3 May 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\nInitially Eno began to experiment with tape loops to create [[generative music]] systems. With the advent of CDs he developed systems to make music of indeterminate duration using several discs of material that he'd specifically recorded so that they would work together musically when driven by random playback.\n\nIn 1995, he began working with the company Intermorphic to create generative music through utilising programmed algorithms. The collaboration with Intermorphic led Eno to release ''Generative Music 1'' - which requires Intermorphic's ''Koan Player'' software for PC. The Koan software made it possible for generative music to be experienced in the domestic environment for the first time.\n\n====Generative Music 1====\nIn 1996, Eno collaborated in developing the SSEYO [[Koan (program)|Koan]] generative music software system (by Pete Cole and Tim Cole of Intermorphic) that he used in composing ''Generative Music 1''\u2014only playable on the Koan generative music system. Further music releases using Koan software include: ''Wander'' (2001) and ''Dark Symphony'' (2007)\u2014both include works by Eno, and those of other artists (including SSEYO's Tim Cole).\n\n====Released excerpts====\nEno started to release excerpts of results from his 'generative music' systems as early as 1975 with the album ''Discreet Music''. Then again in 1978 with ''Music for Airports'':\n\n{{Quote|text=Music for Airports, at least one of the pieces on there, is structurally very, very simple. There are sung notes, sung by three women and my self. One of the notes repeats every 23 1/2 seconds. It is in fact a long [recorded tape] loop running around a series of tubular aluminum chairs in Conny Plank's studio. The next lowest loop repeats every 25 7/8 seconds or something like that. The third one every 29 15/16 seconds or something. What I mean is they all repeat in cycles that are called incommensurable \u2013 they are not likely to come back into sync again. So this is the piece moving along in time. Your experience of the piece of course is a moment in time, there. So as the piece progresses, what you hear are the various clusterings and configurations of these six basic elements. The basic elements in that particular piece never change. They stay the same. But the piece does appear to have quite a lot of variety. In fact it's about eight minutes long on that record, but I did have a thirty minute version which I would bore friends who would listen to it. The thing about pieces like this of course is that they are actually of almost infinite length if the numbers involved are complex enough. They simply don't ever re-configure in the same way again. This is music for free in a sense. The considerations that are important, then, become questions of how the system works and most important of all what you feed into the system. |author=Brian Eno |source=Generative Music: A talk delivered in San Francisco, June 8, 1996<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inmotionmagazine.com/eno1.html|title=Generative Music \u2013 Brian Eno \u2013 In Motion Magazine|website=Inmotionmagazine.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nThe list below consists of albums, soundtracks and downloadable files that contain excerpts from some of Eno's generative music explorations:\n{{div col}}\n\n* 1970 \u2013 Berlin Horse [Film Short]\n* 1975 \u2013 Discreet Music\n* 1975 \u2013 Evening Star (Fripp & Eno)\n* 1978 \u2013 Ambient 1: Music For Airports\n* 1981 \u2013 Mistaken Memories of Mediaeval Manhattan [Installation Video]\n* 1982 \u2013 Ambient 4: On Land\n* 1983 \u2013 Apollo: Atmospheres & Soundtracks (Eno, Lanois & R Eno)\n* 1983 \u2013 Music For Films II (Eno, Lanois & R Eno) [exclusive to 'Working Backwards' Box Set]\n* 1984 \u2013 Thursday Afternoon [Installation Video]\n* 1985 \u2013 Thursday Afternoon\n* 1988 \u2013 Music For Films III (Various Artists)\n* 1989 \u2013 Textures (Eno, Lanois & R Eno)\n* 1989 \u2013 For All Mankind [Documentary Soundtrack]\n* 1992 \u2013 The Shutov Assembly\n* 1993 \u2013 Neroli (Thinking Music Part IV)\n* 1994 \u2013 Glitterbug [Original Soundtrack]\n* 1996 \u2013 Neverwhere [BBC TV Mini-Series Soundtrack]\n* 1997 \u2013 Contra 1.2\n* 1997 \u2013 Lightness\n* 1998 \u2013 Music for Prague\n* 1999 \u2013 I Dormienti\n* 1999 \u2013 Kite Stories\n* 2000 \u2013 Music For Civic Recovery Centre\n* 2001 \u2013 Compact Forest Proposal\n* 2003 \u2013 Curiosities \u2013 Volume I\n* 2004 \u2013 Curiosities \u2013 Volume II\n* 2012 \u2013 Lux\n* 2013 \u2013 CAM [Web \u2013 the book 'Brian Eno: Visual Music' includes a Download Code]\n* 2014 \u2013 The Shutov Bonus Material ['Shutov Assembly' Bonus CD]\n* 2014 \u2013 New Space Music ['Neroli' Bonus CD]\n* 2016 \u2013 The Ship\n* 2016 \u2013 Reflection\n* 2017 \u2013 Sisters [Web Download]\n* 2018 \u2013 Music for Installations [Box Set]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.enoshop.co.uk/BrianEnoMusicForInstallations | title=Brian Eno Releases 'Music for Installations' on May 4th (2018)|website=Enoshop.co.uk|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\nSeveral of the released excerpts (listed above) originated as, or are derivative of, soundtracks Eno created for art installations.

Ross writes in the programme notes to Matrix 44 in 1981: \"In a series of painterly video installations first shown in 1979, Eno explored the notion of environmental ambiance. Eno proposes a use for music and video that is antithetical to behavior control-oriented \"Muzak\" in that it induces and invites the viewer to enter a meditative, detached state, rather than serve as an operant conditioner for work-force efficiency. His underlying strategy is to create works which provide natural levels of variety and redundancy which bring attention to, rather than mimic, essential characteristics of the natural environment. Eno echoes Matisse's stated desire that his art serve as an armchair for the weary businessman.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.bampfa.berkeley.edu/exhibition/44|title=BAMPFA - Art Exhibitions - Brian Eno / MATRIX 44|website=Archive.bampfa.berkeley.edu|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nEarly installations benefitted from breakthroughs in video technology that inspired Eno to use the TV screen as a monitor and enabled him to experiment with the opposite of the fast-moving narratives typical of TV to create evolving images with an almost imperceptible rate of change. \"2 Fifth Avenue\", (\"a linear four-screen installation with music from Music For Airports\") resulted from Eno shooting \"the view from his apartment window: without&nbsp;... intervention,\" recording \"what was in front of the camera for an unspecified period of time&nbsp;... In a simple but crude form of experimental post production, the colour controls of the monitors on which the work was shown were adjusted to wash out the picture, producing a high-contrast black and white image in which colour appeared only in the darkest areas.&nbsp;... Eno manipulated colour as though painting, observing: 'video for me is a way of configuring light, just as painting is a way of configuring paint.'\"<ref>Brian Eno Visual Music. Christopher Scoates pp.116\u2013117 {{ISBN|978-1452108490}}</ref>\n\nFrom the outset, Eno's video works, were \"more in the sphere of paintings than of cinema\".<ref name=\"auto1\">My Light Years Brian Eno accompanying essay to 77 Million Paintings. 2006 HNDVD 1521</ref> The author and artist [[John Coulthart]] called Mistaken Memories of Medieval Manhattan (1980\u201381), which incorporated music from [[Ambient 4: On Land]], \"The first ambient film.\" He explains: \"Eno filmed several static views of New York and its drifting cloudscape from his thirteenth-floor apartment in 1980\u201381. The low-grade equipment&nbsp;... give[s] the images a hazy, impressionistic quality.

TV was actually the most controllable light source that had ever been invented \u2013 because you could precisely specify the movement and behaviour of several million points of coloured light on a surface. The fact that this prodigious possibility had almost exclusively been used to reproduce figurative images in the service of narratives pointed to evolution of the medium from the theatre and cinema. What I thought was that this machine, which pumped out highly controllable light, was actually the first synthesizer, and that its use as an imager-retailer represented a subset of its possible range.\" <ref>Eno: My Light Years. np. Brian Eno: Visual Music. Christopher Scoates. P121. Chronicle Books. {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>\n\nTurning the TV on its back, Eno played video colour fields of differing lengths of time that would slowly re-combine in different configurations. Placing ziggurats (3 dimensional constructions) of different lengths and sizes on top of the screens that defined each separate colour field, these served to project the internal light source upward. \"The light from it was tangible as though caught in a cloud of vapour. Its slowly changing hues and striking colour collisions were addictive. We sat watching for ages, transfixed by this totally new experience of light as a physical presence.\"<ref>Eno: My Light Years. np. Brian Eno: Visual Music. Christopher Scoates. P122. Chronicle Books. {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>\n\nCalling these light sculptures Crystals (first shown in Boston in 1983), Eno further developed them for the Pictures of Venice exhibition at Gabriella Cardazzo's Cavallino Gallery (Venice,1985). Placing plexiglass on top of the structures he found that these further diffused the light so the shapes outlined through this surface appeared to be described differently in the slowly changing fields of light.<ref>My Light Years Brian Eno np accompanying essay to 77 Million Paintings. 2006 HNDVD 1521</ref>\n\nBy positioning sound sources in different places and different heights in the exhibition room Eno intended that the music would be something listened to from the inside rather than the outside. For the [[I Dormienti]] show in 1999 that featured sculptures of sleeping figures by [[Mimmo Paladino]] in the middle of the circular room, Eno placed speakers in each of the 12 tunnels running from it.\n\nEnvisioning the speakers themselves as instruments, led to Eno's 'speaker flowers' becoming a feature of many installations, including at the Museo dell' Ara Pacis (Rome, 2008), again with Mimmo Paladino and 'Speaker Flowers and Lightboxes' at [[Castello Svevo]] in Trani (Italy 2017). Re-imagining the speaker as a flower with a voice that could be heard as it moved in the breeze, he made 'bunches' of them, \"sculptural objects [that]&nbsp;... consist of tiny chassis speakers attached to tall metal stands that sway in response to the sound they emit.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090106131601/http://www.jamesputnam.org.uk/httpwww.jamesputnam.org.ukinv_exhibition_26.html] {{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref> The first version of these were shown at the [[Stedelijk Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]](1984).\n\nSince ''[[On Land]]'' (1982), Eno has sought to blur the boundaries between music and non-music and incorporates environmental sounds into his work. He treats synthesised and recorded sounds for specific effects.<ref>''Brian Eno : Visual Music: The Aesthetics of Time'',  Christopher Scoates, pp. 135\ufffd\ufffd-137, {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>\n\nIn the antithesis of 20th century [[shock art]], Eno's works create environments that are: \"Envisioned as extensions of everyday life while offering a refuge from its stresses.\"<ref>Brian Eno Visual Music p.132 Christopher Scoates. {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref> Creating a space to reflect was a stated aim in Eno's Quiet Club series of installations that have shown across the world, and include [[Music for Civic Recovery Centre]] at the [[David Toop]] curated Sonic Boom festival at the [[Hayward Gallery]] in 2000.\n\nThe Quiet Club series (1986-2001) grew from Eno's site-specific installations that included the Place series (1985-1989). These also featured light sculptures and audio with the addition of conventional materials, such as \"tree trunks, fish bowls, ladders, rocks\". Eno used these in unconventional ways to create new and unexpected experiences and modes of engagements, offering an extension of and refuge from, everyday life.<ref>Brian Eno: Visual Music: The Aesthetics of Time: Christopher Scoates pp132/136 {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>\n\nThe continually flowing non-repeating music and art of Eno's installations mitigate against [[habituation]] to the work and maintain the visitors' engagement with it. \"One of the things I enjoy about my shows is...lots of people sitting quietly watching something that has no story, few recognisable images and changes very slowly. It's somewhere between the experience of painting, cinema, music and meditation...I dispute the assumption that everyone's attention span is getting shorter: I find people are begging for experiences that are longer and slower, less \"dramatic\" and more sensual.\" <ref>{Brian Eno Visual Music p.135 Christopher Scoates. {{ISBN|978-1452108490}}}</ref> Tanya Zimbardo writing on New Urban Spaces Series 4. \"Compact Forest Proposal\" for SF MOMA (2001) confirms: \"During the first presentation of this work, as part of the exhibition 010101: Art in Technological Times at SFMOMA in 2001, visitors often spent considerable time in this dreamlike space.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfmoma.org/publication/soundtracks/brian-eno/|title=Brian Eno|website=SFMOMA|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn Eno's work, both art and music are released from their normal constraints. The music set up to randomly reconfigure is modal and abstract rather than tonal, and so the listener is freed from expectations set up by Western tonal harmonic conventions.<ref>The Dynamics of Harmony: Pratt. {{ISBN|9780198790204}}</ref> The artworks in their continual slowly shifting combinations of colour (and in the case of 77 Million Paintings image re-configurations) themselves offer a continually engaging immersive experience through their unfolding fields of light.\n\n====77 Million Paintings====\nDevelopments in computer technology meant that the experience of Eno's unending non-repeatable generative art and music was no longer only possible in the public spaces of his exhibitions. With software developer and programmer Jake Dowie, Eno created a generative art/music installation '[[77 Million Paintings]]' for the domestic environment. Developed for both PC and Mac, the process is explained by Nick Robertson in the accompanying booklet. \"One way to approach this idea is to imagine that you have a large box full of painted components and you are allowed to blindly take out between one and four of these at any time and overlay them to make a complete painting. The selection of the elements and their duration in the painting is variable and arbitrarily determined\u2026\" <ref name=\"auto2\">Painting By Numbers, Nick Robertson, 77 Million Paintings HNDVD 1521</ref>\n\nMost (nearly all) of the visual 'elements' were hand-painted by Eno onto glass slides, creating an organic heart to the work. Some of the slides had formed his earlier 'Natural Selections' exhibition projected onto the windows of the [[Triennale]] in Milan. (1990). This exhibition marked the beginning of Eno's site specific installations that re-defined spaces on a large scale.<ref>Brian Eno Visual Music The Aesthetics of Time. Christopher Scoates. ISBN P. 124</ref>\n\nFor the Triennale exhibition, Eno with Rolf Engel and Roland Blum at Atelier Marktgraph, used new 'dataton' technology that could be programmed to control the fade up and out times of the light sources.<ref>My Light Years by Brian Eno. 77 Million Paintings (accompanying booklet)HNDVD 1521</ref> But, unlike the software developed for '77 Million', this was clumsy and limited the practical realisation of Eno's vision.\n\nWith the computer programmed to randomly select a combination of up to four images of different durations, the on screen painting continually reconfigures as each image slowly dissolves whilst another appears. The painting will be different for every viewer in every situation, uniquely defining each moment. Eno likens his role in creating this piece to one of a gardener planting seeds. And like a gardener he watches to see how they grow, waiting to see if further intervention is necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.edge.org/conversation/brian_eno-composers-as-gardeners|title=Composers as Gardeners|website=Edge.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref> In the liner notes Nick Robertson explains: \"Every user will buy exactly the same pack of 'seeds' but they will all grow in different ways and into distinct paintings, the vast majority of which, the artist himself has not even seen. \u2026The original in art is no longer solely bound up in the physical object, but rather in the way the piece lives and grows.\"<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nAlthough designed for the domestic environment, 77 million paintings has been (and continues to be) exhibited in multi-screen installations across the world. It has also been projected onto architectural structures, including the sails of the [[Sydney Opera House]] (2009), [[Carioca Aqueduct]] (The Arcos Di Lapa) Brazil (2012) and the giant [[Lovell Telescope]] at the [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]] (2016). During an exhibition at Fabrica Brighton, (2010) the orthopaedic surgeon Robin Turner noticed the calming effect the work had on the visitors.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Turner asked Eno to provide a version for the Montefiore hospital in Hove. Since then 77 Million and Eno's latest \"Light Boxes\" have been commissioned for use in hospitals.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n====Montefiore Hospital Installations====\nIn 2013, Eno created two permanent light and sound installations at Montefiore Hospital in Hove, East Sussex, England.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-22189774|title=Brian Eno branches out into hospital work|first=Jane|last=Dreaper|date=19 April 2013|accessdate=3 May 2017|website=Bbc.com}}</ref> In the hospital's reception area \"77 Million Paintings for Montefiore\" consists of eight plasma monitors mounted on the wall in a diagonally radiating flower-like pattern. They display an evolving collage of coloured patterns and shapes whilst Eno's generative ambient music plays discreetly in the background. The other aptly named \"Quiet Room for Montefiore\" (available for patients, visitors and staff) is a space set apart for meditative reflection. It is a moderately sized room with three large panels displaying dissolves of subtle colours in patterns that are reminiscent of Mondrian paintings. The environment brings Eno's ambient music into focus and facilitates the visitors' cognitive drift, freeing them to contemplate or relax.\n\n====Spore====\nEno composed most of the music for the [[Electronic Arts]] video game [[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]] (2008), assisted by his long-term collaborator, the musician and programmer [[Peter Chilvers (musician)|Peter Chilvers]]. Much of the music is generative and responsive to the player's position within the game.\n\n====iOS apps====\nInspired by possibilities presented to Eno and Peter Chilvers whilst working together on the generative soundtrack for the video game ''Spore'' (2008), the two began to release generative music in the [[App Store (iOS)|Apple App]] format. They set up the website generativemusic.com and created generative music applications for the [[iPhone]], [[iPod Touch]], and [[iPad]]:\n\n* 2008 \u2013 [[Bloom (software)|''Bloom'']]\n* 2009 \u2013 ''Trope''\n* 2012 \u2013 ''Scape''\n* 2016 \u2013 ''Reflection''\n\nIn 2009, Peter Chilvers and Sandra O'Neill also created an App entitled ''Air'' (released through generativemusic.com as well) \u2013 based on concepts developed by Eno in his ''Ambient 1: Music for Airports'' album.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://blog.wired.com/music/2008/10/review-brian-en.html |title=Eno and Chilvers Release Sweet Music App for iPhone &#124, Listening Post |journal=Wired |date=9 October 2008 |accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Reflection====\nThe generative version of ''Reflection'' is the fourth iOS App created by Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers: of generativemusic.com. Unlike other Apps they released ''Reflection'' provides no real options other than Play/Pause \u2013 later, in its initial update, Airplay and Sleep Timer options were added. As Apple had started increasing prices for Apps sold in UK, they lowered its price. For those who'd bought the app at a higher price, Eno and Chilvers provided links to a free download of a four track album called 'Sisters' (each track with a 15:14 duration). The following appears on the app's Apple iTunes page:\n\n{{Quote|text=As a result of the Brexit-related fall in value of the British pound Apple have increased the prices of all apps sold in the UK by 25%. While we always intended REFLECTION to be a premium priced app, we feel this increase makes it too expensive, so we will take the hit in order to keep the British price to the consumer at its original level.\n\nIn other territories this decision will translate into a reduced price for the app.\n\nAs a thank you to everyone who has supported the REFLECTION app, we are adding a free surprise downloadable gift to it for a limited time.

I wanted also that this music would unfold differently all the time \u2013 'like sitting by a river': it's always the same river, but it's always changing. But recordings \u2013 whether vinyl, cassette or CD \u2013 are limited in length, and replay identically each time you listen to them. So in the past I was limited to making the systems which make the music, but then recording 30 minutes or an hour and releasing that. Reflection in its album form \u2013 on vinyl or CD \u2013 is like this. But the app by which Reflection is produced is not restricted: it creates an endless and endlessly changing version of the piece of music.\n\nThe creation of a piece of music like this falls into three stages: the first is the selection of sonic materials and a musical mode \u2013 a constellation of musical relationships. These are then patterned and explored by a system of algorithms which vary and permutate the initial elements I feed into them, resulting in a constantly morphing stream (or river) of music. The third stage is listening. Once I have the system up and running I spend a long time \u2013 many days and weeks in fact \u2013 seeing what it does and fine-tuning the materials and sets of rules that run the algorithms. It's a lot like gardening: you plant the seeds and then you keep tending to them until you get a garden you like.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/brianenomusic/posts/1516385288375657|title=Brian Eno|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nThe version of ''Reflection'' available on the fixed formats (CD, Vinyl and download File) consists of two (joined) excerpts from the ''Reflection'' app. This was revealed in Brian's interview with Philip Sherburne:\n\n{{Quote|text=[Philip Sherburne] Given the infinite nature of the Reflection project, was it difficult to select the 54-minute chunk that became the album?\n\n[Brian Eno] Yes, it was quite interesting doing that. When you're running it as an ephemeral piece, you have quite different considerations. If there is something that is a bit doubtful or odd, you think, OK, that's just in the nature of the piece and now it's passed and we're somewhere else. Whereas if you're thinking of it as a record that people are going to listen to again and again, what philosophy do you take? Choose just a random amount of time? Could have done that. Just do several of them and fix them together? Is that faking it? These are very interesting philosophical questions.\n\n[Philip Sherburne] Which approach did you follow?\n\n[Brian Eno] A hybrid approach. I generated 11 pieces of the length I'd set the piece to be and I had them all in my iTunes on random shuffle, so I would be listening at night, doing other things, and as one ran through, I would think, That was a nice one, I particularly like the second half. So then I would make a note. I did this for quite a few evenings. There were two that I really liked. On one, the last 40 minutes of it were lovely, and on another, the first 25 minutes of it were really nice. So I thought, This is a studio, I'm making a record. I'll edit them together! It was like the birth of rock'n'roll. I'm allowed to do that! It's not cheating. It was quite a bit of jiggery-pokery to find a place I could do it, but the result is two pieces stuck together. |author=Philip Sherburne / Brian Eno |source=A Conversation With Brian Eno About Ambient Music<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/interview/10023-a-conversation-with-brian-eno-about-ambient-music/|title=A Conversation With Brian Eno About Ambient Music \u2013 Pitchfork|website=Pitchfork.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>}}\n\n===Artworks: Light Boxes===\nEno's \"light boxes\" utilise advances in LED technology that has enabled him to re-imagine his ziggurat light paintings - and early light boxes as featured in [[Kite Stories]] (1999) - for the domestic environment. The light boxes feature slowly changing combinations of colour fields that draw attention differently to the shapes outlined by delineating structures within. As the paintings slowly evolve each passing moment is defined differently, drawing the viewer's focus into the present moment. The writer and cultural essayist Michael Bracewell writes that the viewer \"is also encouraged to engage with a generative sensor/aesthetic experience that reflects the ever-changing moods and randomness of life itself\". He likens Eno's art to \"Matisse or Rothko at their most enfolding.\" <ref>Brian Eno - Light Music: Shedding Light. Michael Bracewell.

They remain in permanent display in both private and public spaces. Recognised for their therapeutic contemplative benefits, Eno's 'light paintings' have been commissioned for specially dedicated places of reflection including in Chelsea and Westminster hospital, the Montefiore Hospital in Hove and a three and a half metre lightbox for the sanctuary room in the Macmillan Horizon Centre in Brighton.\n\n===Obscure Records===\nEno started the Obscure Records label in Britain in 1975 to release works by lesser-known composers. The first group of three releases included his own composition, ''[[Discreet Music]]'', and the now-famous ''The Sinking of the Titanic'' (1969) and ''[[Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet]]'' (1971) by [[Gavin Bryars]]. The second side of ''Discreet Music'' consisted of several versions of [[Canon in D|Pachelbel's Canon]], the composition which Eno had previously chosen to precede Roxy Music's appearances on stage and to which he applied various algorithmic transformations, rendering it almost unrecognisable.

Due to Eno's decision not to add any extra tracks of the original material, a handful of tracks originally issued as singles have not been reissued, including the single mix of \"King's Lead Hat\", the title of which is an [[anagram]] of \"[[Talking Heads]]\", whilst \"Seven Deadly Finns\" and \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\" were included on the [[Deletion (music industry)|deleted]] ''Eno Box II: Vocal''.\n\nDuring this period, Eno also played three dates with [[Phil Manzanera]] in the band [[801 (band)|801]], a \"[[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]]\" that performed more or less reworked selections from albums by Eno, Manzanera, and [[Quiet Sun (band)|Quiet Sun]], as well as covers of songs by [[The Beatles]] (\"[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]\") and [[The Kinks]] (\"[[You Really Got Me]]\").\n\nIn 1967, Eno developed a [[delay (audio effect)|tape delay]] system. The technique involved two [[Revox]] tape recorders set up side by side, with the tape unspooling from the first deck being carried over to the second deck to be spooled.  This enabled sound recorded on the first deck to be played back by the second deck at a time delay that varied with the distance between the two decks and the speed of the tape (typically a few seconds). Working with [[Robert Fripp]] (from [[King Crimson]]) the pair used this system in their collaboration ''[[(No Pussyfooting)]]'' (1973).<ref name=\"BBCEquatorialStars\">{{cite web|title = BBC \u2013 Experimental Review \u2013 Fripp Eno, The Equatorial Stars | publisher = BBC| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/qqzf/ |date=5 July 2004|author=Marsh, Peter|accessdate = 8 June 2008 }}</ref> Subsequently, Fripp referred to this method as \"[[Frippertronics]]\". In 1975, Fripp and Eno released a second album, ''[[Evening Star (Fripp & Eno album)|Evening Star]]'', and played several live shows in Europe.\n\nEno was a prominent member of the performance art-classical orchestra the [[Portsmouth Sinfonia]]&nbsp;\u2013 having started playing clarinet with them in 1972. In 1973, he produced the orchestra's first album ''The Portsmouth Sinfonia Plays the Popular Classics'' (released in March 1974) and in 1974, he produced the live album ''Hallelujah! The Portsmouth Sinfonia Live at the Royal Albert Hall'', a recording of their infamous May 1974 concert (released in October 1974). In addition to producing both albums, Eno performed in the orchestra on both recordings playing the clarinet. Eno also deployed the orchestra's famously dissonant string section on his second solo album ''Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)''. The orchestra at this time included other musicians whose solo work he would subsequently release on his Obscure label including [[Gavin Bryars]] and [[Michael Nyman]]. That year he also composed music for the album ''[[Lady June's Linguistic Leprosy]]'', with [[Kevin Ayers]], to accompany the poet [[Lady June|June Campbell Cramer]].\n\n==== Ambient music ====\n{{Main|Ambient music}}\nEno released a number of eclectic ambient electronic and acoustic albums. He coined the term \"ambient music\",<ref>{Prendergast, ''The Ambient Century'': p.93}</ref> which is designed to modify the listener's perception of the surrounding environment. In the liner notes accompanying [[Ambient 1: Music for Airports|''Ambient 1: Music for Airports'']], Eno wrote: \"Ambient music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular, it must be as ignorable as it is interesting.\"<ref>{(PVC7908(AMB001)}</ref>\n\nEno was hit by a taxi while crossing the street in January 1975 and spent several weeks recuperating at home. His girlfriend brought him an old record of harp music, which he lay down to listen to. He realized that he had set the amplifier to a very low volume, and one channel of the stereo was not working, but he lacked the energy to get up and correct it. \"This presented what was for me a new way of hearing music \u2013 as part of the ambience of the environment just as the colour of the light and sound of the rain were parts of the ambience.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/how-brian-eno-created-a-quiet-revolution-in-music/|title=How Brian Eno created a quiet revolution in music|work=The Telegraph|access-date=21 October 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nEno's first work of ambient music was ''[[Discreet Music]]'' (1975), again created with an elaborate tape-delay methodology which he diagrammed on the back cover of the LP; it is considered the landmark album of the genre. This was followed by his ''Ambient'' series: ''[[Music for Airports]] (Ambient 1)'', ''[[The Plateaux of Mirror]] (Ambient 2)'' featuring Harold Budd on keyboard, ''[[Day of Radiance]] (Ambient 3)'' with American composer [[Laraaji]] playing zither and hammered dulcimer, and ''[[On Land]] (Ambient 4)'').\n\n===1980s===\n\nIn 1980, Eno provided a film score for [[Herbert Vesely]]'s ''[[Egon Schiele \u2013 Exzess und Bestrafung]]'', also known as ''Egon Schiele \u2013 Excess and Punishment''. The ambient-style score was an unusual choice for an historical piece, but it worked effectively with the film's themes of sexual obsession and death.\n\nBefore Eno made ''On Land,'' [[Robert Quine]] played him [[Miles Davis]]' \"[[Get Up With It|He Loved Him Madly]]\" (1974). Eno stated in the liner notes for ''On Land,'' \"Teo Macero's revolutionary production on that piece seemed to me to have the \"spacious\" quality I was after, and like Federico Fellini's 1973 film ''Amarcord'', it too became a touchstone to which I returned frequently.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/onland-txt.html |title=''Ambient 4: On Land'' 1986 release notes |publisher=Music.hyperreal.org |accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980 to 1981, during which time Eno travelled to [[Ghana]] for a festival of West African music, he was collaborating with [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]] of [[Talking Heads]]. Their album [[My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (album)|''My Life in the Bush of Ghosts'']], was built around radio broadcasts Eno collected whilst living in the [[United States]], along with sampled music recordings from around the world transposed over music predominantly inspired by African and [[Middle East]]ern rhythms.\n\nIn 1983, Eno collaborated with his brother, [[Roger Eno]], and [[Daniel Lanois]] on the album ''[[Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks]]'' that had been commissioned by Al Reinert for his film ''[[For All Mankind]]'' (1989).<ref>{{cite news|first1=John L.|last1=Walters|accessdate=2019-08-10|title=Pop review: Brian Eno's Apollo|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/22/brian-eno-apollo-review|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=22 July 2009|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|accessdate=2019-08-10|title=Brian Eno explains Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jul/08/apollo-11-moon-brian-eno|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=8 July 2009|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Tracks from the album were subsequently used in several other films, including ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951/soundtrack|title=Trainspotting (1996)|accessdate=16 January 2018|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nIn September 1992, Eno released ''[[Nerve Net]]'', an album utilising heavily syncopated rhythms with contributions from several former collaborators including Fripp, [[Benmont Tench]], [[Robert Quine]] and [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]]. This album was a last-minute substitution for ''My Squelchy Life'', which contained more pop oriented material, with Eno on vocals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20032-brian-eno-nerve-netthe-shutov-assemblynerolithe-drop/|title=Brian Eno: Nerve Net/The Shutov Assembly/Neroli/The Drop Album Review - Pitchfork|website=Pitchfork.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref> Several tracks from ''My Squelchy Life'' later appeared on 1993's retrospective box set ''Eno Box II: Vocals,'' and the entire album was eventually released in 2014 as part of an expanded re-release of ''Nerve Net.'' Eno also released ''[[The Shutov Assembly]]'' in 1992, recorded between 1985 and 1990. This album embraces [[atonality]] and abandons most conventional concepts of [[Mode (music)|modes]], [[Scale (music)|scales]] and [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]. Emancipated from the constant attraction towards the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] that underpins the Western [[tonal music|tonal tradition]], the gradually shifting music originally eschewed any conventional instrumentation, save for treated keyboards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/interviews/me_intr3.html#q2|title=Brian Eno interviewed by Michael Engelbrecht|website=Music.hyperreal.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=May 2019}}\n\nDuring the 1990s, Eno worked increasingly with self-generating musical systems, the results of which he called [[generative music]]. This allows the listener to hear music that slowly unfolds in almost infinite non-repeating combinations of sound.<ref>The Cambridge Companion to Electronic Music pp118-119 Ed. Nick Collins ({{ISBN|9780521688659}})</ref> In one instance of generative music, Eno calculated that it would take almost 10,000 years to hear the entire possibilities of one individual piece. Eno achieves this through the blending of several independent musical tracks of varying length. Each track features different musical elements and in some cases, silence. When each individual track concludes, it starts again re-configuring differently with the other tracks. He has presented this music in his own art and sound installations and those in collaboration with other artists, including ''[[I Dormienti]] (The Sleepers)'', ''[[Lightness: Music for the Marble Palace \u2013 The State Russian Museum, St. Petersburg|Lightness: Music for the Marble Palace]],'' ''[[Music for Civic Recovery Centre]],'' ''[[The Quiet Room]],'' and ''Music for Prague.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/the-long-now-foundation/music-time-and-long-term-thinking-brian-eno-expands-the-vocabulary-of-human-feeling-98e0fbad5950|title=Brian Eno Expands the Vocabulary of Human Feeling|first=The Long Now|last=Foundation|date=30 November 2017|website=Medium.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nOne of Eno's better-known collaborations was with the members of [[U2]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]] and several other artists in a group called Passengers. They produced the 1995 album ''[[Original Soundtracks 1]],'' which reached No. 76 on the US [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] and No. 12 in the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It featured a single, \"[[Miss Sarajevo]]\", which reached number 6 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/miss%20sarajevo/|title=miss+sarajevo {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|access-date=18 January 2017}}</ref> This collaboration is chronicled in Eno's book ''[[A Year with Swollen Appendices]],'' a diary published in 1996.\n\nIn 1996, Eno scored the six-part fantasy television series ''[[Neverwhere]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115288/fullcredits|title=Neverwhere (TV Mini-Series 1996\u2013 )|accessdate=8 December 2017|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2004, Fripp and Eno recorded another ambient music collaboration album, ''[[The Equatorial Stars]]''.\n\nEno returned in June 2005 with ''[[Another Day on Earth]]'', his first major album since ''[[Wrong Way Up]]'' (with [[John Cale]]) to prominently feature vocals (a trend he continued with ''[[Everything That Happens Will Happen Today]]''). The album differs from his 1970s solo work due to the impact technological advances on musical production, evident in its semi-electronic production.\n\nIn early 2006, Eno collaborated with David Byrne again, for the reissue of ''My Life in the Bush of Ghosts'' in celebration of the influential album's 25th anniversary. Eight previously unreleased tracks recorded during the initial sessions in 1980/81, were added to the album.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6382-david-byrne/\n| title = Interview: David Byrne\n| last = Dahlen\n| first = Chris\n| date = 17 July 2006\n| work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]}}</ref>\nAn unusual interactive marketing strategy was employed for its re-release, the album's promotional website features the ability for anyone to officially and legally download the [[multitrack recording|multi-tracks]] of two songs from the album, \"A Secret Life\" and \"Help Me Somebody\". This allowed listeners to [[remix]] and upload new mixes of these tracks to the website for others to listen and rate them.\n\n[[File:Brian Eno Profile Long Now Foundation 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Eno at the [[Long Now Foundation]], 26 June 2006]]\nIn late 2006, Eno released ''[[77 Million Paintings]]'', a program of generative video and music specifically for home computers. As its title suggests, there is a possible combination of 77 million paintings where the viewer will see different combinations of video slides prepared by Eno each time the program is launched. Likewise, the accompanying music is generated by the program so that it's almost certain the listener will never hear the same arrangement twice. The second edition of \"77 Million Paintings\" featuring improved morphing and a further two layers of sound was released on 14 January 2008. In June 2007, when commissioned in the [[Yerba Buena Center for the Arts]], San Francisco, California, [[Annabeth Robinson]] (AngryBeth Shortbread) recreated ''77 Million Paintings'' in [[Second Life]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Author|first=Unknown|title=77-million-paintings-brian-eno|url=http://longnow.org/events/02007/jun/29/77-million-paintings-brian-eno/|work=77 Million Paintings|publisher=The Long Now Foundation|accessdate=1 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Eno's music was featured in a [[Ecstasy (2007 film)|movie adaption]] of [[Irvine Welsh]]'s best-selling collection ''[[Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance]]''. He also appeared playing keyboards in ''[[Voila (album)|Voila]]'', [[Belinda Carlisle]]'s solo album sung entirely in French.\n\nAlso in 2007, Eno contributed a composition titled \"Grafton Street\" to [[Dido (singer)|Dido's]] third album, ''[[Safe Trip Home]]'', released in November 2008.<ref name=\"qmag\">Aizlewood, John.

In the past we saw the universe as a perfect, divine creation \u2013 logical, finite, deterministic \u2013 and our art reflected that.

Eno's lengthy string of producer credits includes albums for [[Talking Heads]], [[U2]], [[Devo]], [[Ultravox]] and [[James (band)|James]]. He also produced part of the 1993 album ''[[When I Was a Boy]]'' by [[Jane Siberry]]. He won the best producer award at the 1994 and 1996 [[BRIT Awards]].\n\nEno describes himself as a \"non-musician\", using the term \"treatments\" to describe his modification of the sound of musical instruments, and to separate his role from that of the traditional instrumentalist. His skill at using \"The Studio as a Compositional Tool\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/interviews/downbeat79.htm |title=Pro Session&nbsp;\u2013 The Studio as Compositional Tool |publisher=Music.hyperreal.org |accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref> (the title of an essay by Eno) led in part to his career as a producer. His methods were recognised at the time (mid-1970s) as unique, so much so that on [[Genesis (band)|Genesis's]] ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'', he is credited with 'Enossification'; on [[Robert Wyatt]]'s ''[[Ruth Is Stranger Than Richard]]'' with a ''Direct inject anti-jazz raygun'' and on [[John Cale]]'s [[Island Records|Island]] albums as simply being \"Eno\".\n\nEno has contributed to recordings by artists as varied as [[Nico]], Robert Calvert, [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[David Bowie]], and [[Zvuki Mu]], in various capacities such as use of his studio/synthesiser/electronic treatments, vocals, guitar, bass guitar, and as just being 'Eno'. In 1984, he (amongst others) composed and performed the \"Prophecy Theme\" for the [[David Lynch]] film ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]''; the rest of the [[Dune (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] was composed and performed by the group [[Toto (band)|Toto]]. Eno produced performance artist [[Laurie Anderson (performance artist)|Laurie Anderson]]'s ''[[Bright Red]]'' album, and also composed for it. The work is avant-garde spoken word with haunting and magnifying sounds. Eno played on David Byrne's musical score for ''The Catherine Wheel'', a project commissioned by [[Twyla Tharp]] to accompany her Broadway dance project of the same name.\n\nHe worked with Bowie as a writer and musician on Bowie's influential 1977\u201379 'Berlin Trilogy' of albums, ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]], [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|\"Heroes\"]]'' and ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'', on Bowie's later album ''[[Outside (David Bowie album)|Outside]]'', and on the song \"[[I'm Afraid of Americans]]\". Recorded in France and Germany, the spacey effects on ''Low'' were largely created by Eno, who played a portable [[EMS Synthi A]] synthesizer.

In 1995, U2 and Eno joined forces to create the album ''[[Original Soundtracks 1]]'' under the group name Passengers; songs from which included \"[[Your Blue Room]]\" and \"[[Miss Sarajevo]]\".  Even though films are listed and described for each song, all but three are bogus. Eno also produced ''[[Laid (album)|Laid]]'' (1993), ''[[Wah Wah (album)|Wah Wah]]'' (1994) ''[[Millionaires (album)|Millionaires]]'' (1999) and ''[[Pleased to Meet You (James album)|Pleased to Meet You]]'' (2001) for [[James (band)|James]], performing as an extra musician on all four. He is credited for \"frequent interference and occasional co-production\" on their 1997 album ''[[Whiplash (album)|Whiplash]]''.\n\nEno played on the 1986 album ''[[Measure for Measure (album)|Measure for Measure]]'' by Australian band [[Icehouse (band)|Icehouse]]. He remixed two tracks for [[Depeche Mode]], \"[[I Feel You]]\" and \"[[In Your Room (Depeche Mode song)|In Your Room]]\", both single releases from the album ''[[Songs of Faith and Devotion]]'' in 1993. In 1995, Eno provided one of several remixes of \"[[Protection (Massive Attack song)|Protection]]\" by [[Massive Attack]] (originally from their ''[[Protection (Massive Attack album)|Protection]]'' album) for release as a single.\n\nIn 2007, he produced the fourth studio album by [[Coldplay]], ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends]]'', released in 2008. Also in 2008, he worked with [[Grace Jones]] on her album ''[[Hurricane (Grace Jones album)|Hurricane]]'', credited for \"production consultation\" and as a member of the band, playing keyboards, treatments and background vocals. He worked on the twelfth studio album by [[U2]], again with Lanois, titled ''[[No Line on the Horizon]]''. It was recorded in Morocco, the South of France and [[Dublin]] and released in Europe on 27 February 2009.\n\nIn 2011, Eno and Coldplay reunited and Eno contributed \"enoxification\" and additional composition on Coldplay's fifth studio album ''[[Mylo Xyloto]]'', released on 24 October of that year.\n\n[[File:Brian Eno's musical web.jpg|thumb|Eno's connections to other progressive rock music artists]]\n\n===The Microsoft Sound===\nIn 1994, [[Microsoft]] designers [[Mark Malamud]] and Erik Gavriluk approached Eno to compose music for the [[Windows 95]] project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minyanville.com/businessmarkets/articles/intel-microsoft-research-in-motion-apple/5/25/2010/id/28465?refresh=1|title=Who Created The Windows Start-Up Sound?|last=Rohrlich|first=Justin|date=25 May 2010|work=[[Minyanville]]'s Wall Street|accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref> The result was the six-second [[Booting|start-up]] music-sound of the Windows 95 [[operating system]], \"The Microsoft Sound\".

He started experimenting with the medium of video in 1978. Eno describes the first video camera he received, which would initially become his main tool for creating ambient video and light installations:\n\n\"One afternoon while I was working in the studio with [[Talking Heads]], the roadie from [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], working in an adjacent studio, came in and asked whether anyone wanted to buy some video equipment. I'd never really thought much about video, and found most 'video art' completely unmemorable, but the prospect of actually owning a video camera was, at that time, quite exotic.\"<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). ''77 Million Paintings'' \"My Light Years\". pp. 2.</ref>\n\nThe [[Panasonic]] industrial camera Eno received had significant [[design flaws]] preventing the camera from sitting upright without the assistance of a tripod. This led to his works being filmed in vertical format, requiring the television set to be flipped on its side to view it in the proper orientation.<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). \"My Light Years\". pp. 2.</ref> The pieces Eno produced with this method, such as ''Mistaken Memories of Mediaeval Manhattan'' (1980) and ''[[Thursday Afternoon]]'' (1984) (accompanied by the album of the same title), were labelled as 'Video Paintings.' He explained the genre title in the music magazine NME:\n\n\"I was delighted to find this other way of using video because at last here's video which draws from another source, which is painting&nbsp;... I call them 'video paintings' because if you say to people 'I make videos', they think of Sting's new rock video or some really boring, grimy 'Video Art'. It's just a way of saying, 'I make videos that don't move very fast.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/interviews/nme85.html#Thursday |title=NME: Proxy Music |publisher=Music.hyperreal.org |date=9 November 1985 |accessdate=14 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nThese works presented Eno with the opportunity to expand his ambient aesthetic into a visual form, manipulating the medium of video to produce something not present in the normal television experience. His video works were shown around the world in exhibitions in New York and Tokyo, as well as released on the compilation 14 Video Paintings in 2005.<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). \"My Light Years\". pp. 5.</ref>\n\nEno continued his video experimentation through the 80s, 90s and 2000s, leading to further experimentation with the television as a malleable light source and informing his generative works such as [[77 Million Paintings]] in 2006.<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). \"My Light Years\". pp. 6\u20138.</ref>\n\n===Generative music===\nEno gives the example of [[wind chime]]s. He says that these systems and the creation of them have been a focus of his since he was a student: \"I got interested in the idea of music that could make itself, in a sense, in the mid 1960s really, when I first heard composers like [[Terry Riley]], and when I first started playing with tape recorders.\"\n<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/appsblog/2012/sep/26/brian-eno-scape-ipad-apps|title=Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers talk Scape, iPad apps and generative music|first=Stuart|last=Dredge|date=26 September 2012|accessdate=3 May 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\nInitially Eno began to experiment with tape loops to create [[generative music]] systems. With the advent of CDs he developed systems to make music of indeterminate duration using several discs of material that he'd specifically recorded so that they would work together musically when driven by random playback.\n\nIn 1995, he began working with the company Intermorphic to create generative music through utilising programmed algorithms. The collaboration with Intermorphic led Eno to release ''Generative Music 1'' - which requires Intermorphic's ''Koan Player'' software for PC. The Koan software made it possible for generative music to be experienced in the domestic environment for the first time.\n\n====Generative Music 1====\nIn 1996, Eno collaborated in developing the SSEYO [[Koan (program)|Koan]] generative music software system (by Pete Cole and Tim Cole of Intermorphic) that he used in composing ''Generative Music 1''\u2014only playable on the Koan generative music system. Further music releases using Koan software include: ''Wander'' (2001) and ''Dark Symphony'' (2007)\u2014both include works by Eno, and those of other artists (including SSEYO's Tim Cole).\n\n====Released excerpts====\nEno started to release excerpts of results from his 'generative music' systems as early as 1975 with the album ''Discreet Music''. Then again in 1978 with ''Music for Airports'':\n\n{{Quote|text=Music for Airports, at least one of the pieces on there, is structurally very, very simple. There are sung notes, sung by three women and my self. One of the notes repeats every 23 1/2 seconds. It is in fact a long [recorded tape] loop running around a series of tubular aluminum chairs in Conny Plank's studio. The next lowest loop repeats every 25 7/8 seconds or something like that. The third one every 29 15/16 seconds or something. What I mean is they all repeat in cycles that are called incommensurable \u2013 they are not likely to come back into sync again. So this is the piece moving along in time. Your experience of the piece of course is a moment in time, there. So as the piece progresses, what you hear are the various clusterings and configurations of these six basic elements. The basic elements in that particular piece never change. They stay the same. But the piece does appear to have quite a lot of variety. In fact it's about eight minutes long on that record, but I did have a thirty minute version which I would bore friends who would listen to it. The thing about pieces like this of course is that they are actually of almost infinite length if the numbers involved are complex enough. They simply don't ever re-configure in the same way again. This is music for free in a sense. The considerations that are important, then, become questions of how the system works and most important of all what you feed into the system. |author=Brian Eno |source=Generative Music: A talk delivered in San Francisco, June 8, 1996<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inmotionmagazine.com/eno1.html|title=Generative Music \u2013 Brian Eno \u2013 In Motion Magazine|website=Inmotionmagazine.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nThe list below consists of albums, soundtracks and downloadable files that contain excerpts from some of Eno's generative music explorations:\n{{div col}}\n\n* 1970 \u2013 Berlin Horse [Film Short]\n* 1975 \u2013 Discreet Music\n* 1975 \u2013 Evening Star (Fripp & Eno)\n* 1978 \u2013 Ambient 1: Music For Airports\n* 1981 \u2013 Mistaken Memories of Mediaeval Manhattan [Installation Video]\n* 1982 \u2013 Ambient 4: On Land\n* 1983 \u2013 Apollo: Atmospheres & Soundtracks (Eno, Lanois & R Eno)\n* 1983 \u2013 Music For Films II (Eno, Lanois & R Eno) [exclusive to 'Working Backwards' Box Set]\n* 1984 \u2013 Thursday Afternoon [Installation Video]\n* 1985 \u2013 Thursday Afternoon\n* 1988 \u2013 Music For Films III (Various Artists)\n* 1989 \u2013 Textures (Eno, Lanois & R Eno)\n* 1989 \u2013 For All Mankind [Documentary Soundtrack]\n* 1992 \u2013 The Shutov Assembly\n* 1993 \u2013 Neroli (Thinking Music Part IV)\n* 1994 \u2013 Glitterbug [Original Soundtrack]\n* 1996 \u2013 Neverwhere [BBC TV Mini-Series Soundtrack]\n* 1997 \u2013 Contra 1.2\n* 1997 \u2013 Lightness\n* 1998 \u2013 Music for Prague\n* 1999 \u2013 I Dormienti\n* 1999 \u2013 Kite Stories\n* 2000 \u2013 Music For Civic Recovery Centre\n* 2001 \u2013 Compact Forest Proposal\n* 2003 \u2013 Curiosities \u2013 Volume I\n* 2004 \u2013 Curiosities \u2013 Volume II\n* 2012 \u2013 Lux\n* 2013 \u2013 CAM [Web \u2013 the book 'Brian Eno: Visual Music' includes a Download Code]\n* 2014 \u2013 The Shutov Bonus Material ['Shutov Assembly' Bonus CD]\n* 2014 \u2013 New Space Music ['Neroli' Bonus CD]\n* 2016 \u2013 The Ship\n* 2016 \u2013 Reflection\n* 2017 \u2013 Sisters [Web Download]\n* 2018 \u2013 Music for Installations [Box Set]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.enoshop.co.uk/BrianEnoMusicForInstallations | title=Brian Eno Releases 'Music for Installations' on May 4th (2018)|website=Enoshop.co.uk|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\nSeveral of the released excerpts (listed above) originated as, or are derivative of, soundtracks Eno created for art installations.

Ross writes in the programme notes to Matrix 44 in 1981: \"In a series of painterly video installations first shown in 1979, Eno explored the notion of environmental ambiance. Eno proposes a use for music and video that is antithetical to behavior control-oriented \"Muzak\" in that it induces and invites the viewer to enter a meditative, detached state, rather than serve as an operant conditioner for work-force efficiency. His underlying strategy is to create works which provide natural levels of variety and redundancy which bring attention to, rather than mimic, essential characteristics of the natural environment. Eno echoes Matisse's stated desire that his art serve as an armchair for the weary businessman.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.bampfa.berkeley.edu/exhibition/44|title=BAMPFA - Art Exhibitions - Brian Eno / MATRIX 44|website=Archive.bampfa.berkeley.edu|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nEarly installations benefitted from breakthroughs in video technology that inspired Eno to use the TV screen as a monitor and enabled him to experiment with the opposite of the fast-moving narratives typical of TV to create evolving images with an almost imperceptible rate of change. \"2 Fifth Avenue\", (\"a linear four-screen installation with music from Music For Airports\") resulted from Eno shooting \"the view from his apartment window: without\u2026(any) intervention,\" recording \"what was in front of the camera for an unspecified period of time\u2026 In a simple but crude form of experimental post production, the colour controls of the monitors on which the work was shown were adjusted to wash out the picture, producing a high-contrast black and white image in which colour appeared only in the darkest areas. \u2026 Eno manipulated colour as though painting, observing: 'video for me is a way of configuring light, just as painting is a way of configuring paint.'\"<ref>Brian Eno Visual Music. Christopher Scoates pp.116-117 {{ISBN|978-1452108490}}</ref>\n\nFrom the outset, Eno's video works, were \"more in the sphere of paintings than of cinema\".<ref name=\"auto1\">My Light Years Brian Eno accompanying essay to 77 Million Paintings. 2006 HNDVD 1521</ref> The author/artist [[John Coulthart]] called Mistaken Memories of Medieval Manhattan, (1980\u201381) (which incorporated music from [[Ambient 4: On Land]]) \"The first ambient film.\" He explains: \"Eno filmed several static views of New York and its drifting cloudscape from his thirteenth-floor apartment in 1980\u201381.

The fact that this prodigious possibility had almost exclusively been used to reproduce figurative images in the service of narratives pointed to evolution of the medium from the theatre and cinema. What I thought was that this machine, which pumped out highly controllable light, was actually the first synthesizer, and that its use as an imager-retailer represented a subset of its possible range.\" <ref>Eno: My Light Years. np. Brian Eno: Visual Music. Christopher Scoates. P121. Chronicle Books. {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>\n\nTurning the TV on its back, Eno played video colour fields of differing lengths of time that would slowly re-combine in different configurations. Placing ziggurats (3 dimensional constructions) of different lengths and sizes on top of the screens that defined each separate colour field, these served to project the internal light source upward. \"The light from it was tangible as though caught in a cloud of vapour. Its slowly changing hues and striking colour collisions were addictive. We sat watching for ages, transfixed by this totally new experience of light as a physical presence.\"<ref>Eno: My Light Years. np. Brian Eno: Visual Music. Christopher Scoates. P122. Chronicle Books. {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>\n\nCalling these light sculptures Crystals (first shown in Boston in 1983), Eno further developed them for the Pictures of Venice exhibition at Gabriella Cardazzo's Cavallino Gallery (Venice,1985). Placing plexiglass on top of the structures he found that these further diffused the light so the shapes outlined through this surface appeared to be described differently in the slowly changing fields of light.<ref>My Light Years Brian Eno np accompanying essay to 77 Million Paintings. 2006 HNDVD 1521</ref>\n\nBy positioning sound sources in different places and different heights in the exhibition room Eno intended that the music would be something listened to from the inside rather than the outside. For the [[I Dormienti]] show in 1999 that featured sculptures of sleeping figures by [[Mimmo Paladino]] in the middle of the circular room, Eno placed speakers in each of the 12 tunnels running from it.\n\nEnvisioning the speakers themselves as instruments, led to Eno's 'speaker flowers' becoming a feature of many installations, including at the Museo dell' Ara Pacis (Rome, 2008), again with Mimmo Paladino and 'Speaker Flowers and Lightboxes' at [[Castello Svevo]] in Trani (Italy 2017). Re-imagining the speaker as a flower with a voice that could be heard as it moved in the breeze, he made 'bunches' of them, \"sculptural objects (that) ...consist of tiny chassis speakers attached to tall metal stands that sway in response to the sound they emit.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090106131601/http://www.jamesputnam.org.uk/httpwww.jamesputnam.org.ukinv_exhibition_26.html] {{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref> The first version of these were shown at the [[Stedelijk Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]](1984).\n\nSince ''[[On Land]]'' (1982), Eno has sought to blur the boundaries between music and non-music and incorporates environmental sounds into his work. He treats synthesised and recorded sounds for specific effects.<ref>''Brian Eno : Visual Music: The Aesthetics of Time'',  Christopher Scoates, pp. 135-137, {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>\n\nIn the antithesis of 20th century [[shock art]], Eno's works create environments that are: \"Envisioned as extensions of everyday life while offering a refuge from its stresses.\"<ref>Brian Eno Visual Music p.132 Christopher Scoates. {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref> Creating a space to reflect was a stated aim in Eno's Quiet Club series of installations that have shown across the world, and include [[Music for Civic Recovery Centre]] at the [[David Toop]] curated Sonic Boom festival at the [[Hayward Gallery]] in 2000.\n\nThe Quiet Club series (1986-2001) grew from Eno's site-specific installations that included the Place series (1985-1989). These also featured light sculptures and audio with the addition of conventional materials, such as \"tree trunks, fish bowls, ladders, rocks\". Eno used these in unconventional ways to create new and unexpected experiences and modes of engagements, offering an extension of and refuge from, everyday life.<ref>Brian Eno: Visual Music: The Aesthetics of Time: Christopher Scoates pp132/136 {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>\n\nThe continually flowing non-repeating music and art of Eno's installations mitigate against [[habituation]] to the work and maintain the visitors' engagement with it. \"One of the things I enjoy about my shows is...lots of people sitting quietly watching something that has no story, few recognisable images and changes very slowly. It's somewhere between the experience of painting, cinema, music and meditation...I dispute the assumption that everyone's attention span is getting shorter: I find people are begging for experiences that are longer and slower, less \"dramatic\" and more sensual.\" <ref>{Brian Eno Visual Music p.135 Christopher Scoates. {{ISBN|978-1452108490}}}</ref> Tanya Zimbardo writing on New Urban Spaces Series 4. \"Compact Forest Proposal\" for SF MOMA (2001) confirms: \"During the first presentation of this work, as part of the exhibition 010101: Art in Technological Times at SFMOMA in 2001, visitors often spent considerable time in this dreamlike space.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfmoma.org/publication/soundtracks/brian-eno/|title=Brian Eno|website=SFMOMA|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn Eno's work, both art and music are released from their normal constraints. The music set up to randomly reconfigure is modal and abstract rather than tonal, and so the listener is freed from expectations set up by Western tonal harmonic conventions.<ref>The Dynamics of Harmony: Pratt. {{ISBN|9780198790204}}</ref> The artworks in their continual slowly shifting combinations of colour (and in the case of 77 Million Paintings image re-configurations) themselves offer a continually engaging immersive experience through their unfolding fields of light.\n\n====77 Million Paintings====\nDevelopments in computer technology meant that the experience of Eno's unending non-repeatable generative art and music was no longer only possible in the public spaces of his exhibitions. With software developer and programmer Jake Dowie, Eno created a generative art/music installation '[[77 Million Paintings]]' for the domestic environment. Developed for both PC and Mac, the process is explained by Nick Robertson in the accompanying booklet. \"One way to approach this idea is to imagine that you have a large box full of painted components and you are allowed to blindly take out between one and four of these at any time and overlay them to make a complete painting. The selection of the elements and their duration in the painting is variable and arbitrarily determined\u2026\" <ref name=\"auto2\">Painting By Numbers, Nick Robertson, 77 Million Paintings HNDVD 1521</ref>\n\nMost (nearly all) of the visual 'elements' were hand-painted by Eno onto glass slides, creating an organic heart to the work. Some of the slides had formed his earlier 'Natural Selections' exhibition projected onto the windows of the [[Triennale]] in Milan. (1990). This exhibition marked the beginning of Eno's site specific installations that re-defined spaces on a large scale.<ref>Brian Eno Visual Music The Aesthetics of Time. Christopher Scoates. ISBN P. 124</ref>\n\nFor the Triennale exhibition, Eno with Rolf Engel and Roland Blum at Atelier Marktgraph, used new 'dataton' technology that could be programmed to control the fade up and out times of the light sources.<ref>My Light Years by Brian Eno. 77 Million Paintings (accompanying booklet)HNDVD 1521</ref> But, unlike the software developed for '77 Million', this was clumsy and limited the practical realisation of Eno's vision.\n\nWith the computer programmed to randomly select a combination of up to four images of different durations, the on screen painting continually reconfigures as each image slowly dissolves whilst another appears. The painting will be different for every viewer in every situation, uniquely defining each moment. Eno likens his role in creating this piece to one of a gardener planting seeds. And like a gardener he watches to see how they grow, waiting to see if further intervention is necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.edge.org/conversation/brian_eno-composers-as-gardeners|title=Composers as Gardeners|website=Edge.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref> In the liner notes Nick Robertson explains: \"Every user will buy exactly the same pack of 'seeds' but they will all grow in different ways and into distinct paintings, the vast majority of which, the artist himself has not even seen. \u2026The original in art is no longer solely bound up in the physical object, but rather in the way the piece lives and grows.\"<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nAlthough designed for the domestic environment, 77 million paintings has been (and continues to be) exhibited in multi-screen installations across the world. It has also been projected onto architectural structures, including the sails of the [[Sydney Opera House]] (2009), [[Carioca Aqueduct]] (The Arcos Di Lapa) Brazil (2012) and the giant [[Lovell Telescope]] at the [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]] (2016). During an exhibition at Fabrica Brighton, (2010) the orthopaedic surgeon Robin Turner noticed the calming effect the work had on the visitors.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Turner asked Eno to provide a version for the Montefiore hospital in Hove. Since then 77 Million and Eno's latest \"Light Boxes\" have been commissioned for use in hospitals.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n====Montefiore Hospital Installations====\nIn 2013, Eno created two permanent light and sound installations at Montefiore Hospital in Hove, East Sussex, England.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-22189774|title=Brian Eno branches out into hospital work|first=Jane|last=Dreaper|date=19 April 2013|accessdate=3 May 2017|website=Bbc.com}}</ref> In the hospital's reception area \"77 Million Paintings for Montefiore\" consists of eight plasma monitors mounted on the wall in a diagonally radiating flower-like pattern. They display an evolving collage of coloured patterns and shapes whilst Eno's generative ambient music plays discreetly in the background. The other aptly named \"Quiet Room for Montefiore\" (available for patients, visitors and staff) is a space set apart for meditative reflection. It is a moderately sized room with three large panels displaying dissolves of subtle colours in patterns that are reminiscent of Mondrian paintings. The environment brings Eno's ambient music into focus and facilitates the visitors' cognitive drift, freeing them to contemplate or relax.\n\n====Spore====\nEno composed most of the music for the [[Electronic Arts]] video game [[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]] (2008), assisted by his long-term collaborator, the musician and programmer [[Peter Chilvers (musician)|Peter Chilvers]]. Much of the music is generative and responsive to the player's position within the game.\n\n====iOS apps====\nInspired by possibilities presented to Eno and Peter Chilvers whilst working together on the generative soundtrack for the video game ''Spore'' (2008), the two began to release generative music in the [[App Store (iOS)|Apple App]] format. They set up the website generativemusic.com and created generative music applications for the [[iPhone]], [[iPod Touch]], and [[iPad]]:\n\n* 2008 \u2013 [[Bloom (software)|''Bloom'']]\n* 2009 \u2013 ''Trope''\n* 2012 \u2013 ''Scape''\n* 2016 \u2013 ''Reflection''\n\nIn 2009, Peter Chilvers and Sandra O'Neill also created an App entitled ''Air'' (released through generativemusic.com as well) \u2013 based on concepts developed by Eno in his ''Ambient 1: Music for Airports'' album.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://blog.wired.com/music/2008/10/review-brian-en.html |title=Eno and Chilvers Release Sweet Music App for iPhone &#124, Listening Post |journal=Wired |date=9 October 2008 |accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Reflection====\nThe generative version of ''Reflection'' is the fourth iOS App created by Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers: of generativemusic.com. Unlike other Apps they released ''Reflection'' provides no real options other than Play/Pause \u2013 later, in its initial update, Airplay and Sleep Timer options were added. As Apple had started increasing prices for Apps sold in UK, they lowered its price. For those who'd bought the app at a higher price, Eno and Chilvers provided links to a free download of a four track album called 'Sisters' (each track with a 15:14 duration). The following appears on the app's Apple iTunes page:\n\n{{Quote|text=As a result of the Brexit-related fall in value of the British pound Apple have increased the prices of all apps sold in the UK by 25%. While we always intended REFLECTION to be a premium priced app, we feel this increase makes it too expensive, so we will take the hit in order to keep the British price to the consumer at its original level.\n\nIn other territories this decision will translate into a reduced price for the app.\n\nAs a thank you to everyone who has supported the REFLECTION app, we are adding a free surprise downloadable gift to it for a limited time. To access it, simply update REFLECTION in the App Store and follow the instructions when you open the app on your device.

I wanted also that this music would unfold differently all the time \u2013 'like sitting by a river': it's always the same river, but it's always changing. But recordings \u2013 whether vinyl, cassette or CD \u2013 are limited in length, and replay identically each time you listen to them. So in the past I was limited to making the systems which make the music, but then recording 30 minutes or an hour and releasing that. Reflection in its album form \u2013 on vinyl or CD \u2013 is like this. But the app by which Reflection is produced is not restricted: it creates an endless and endlessly changing version of the piece of music.\n\nThe creation of a piece of music like this falls into three stages: the first is the selection of sonic materials and a musical mode \u2013 a constellation of musical relationships. These are then patterned and explored by a system of algorithms which vary and permutate the initial elements I feed into them, resulting in a constantly morphing stream (or river) of music. The third stage is listening. Once I have the system up and running I spend a long time \u2013 many days and weeks in fact \u2013 seeing what it does and fine-tuning the materials and sets of rules that run the algorithms. It's a lot like gardening: you plant the seeds and then you keep tending to them until you get a garden you like.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/brianenomusic/posts/1516385288375657|title=Brian Eno|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nThe version of ''Reflection'' available on the fixed formats (CD, Vinyl and download File) consists of two (joined) excerpts from the ''Reflection'' app. This was revealed in Brian's interview with Philip Sherburne:\n\n{{Quote|text=[Philip Sherburne] Given the infinite nature of the Reflection project, was it difficult to select the 54-minute chunk that became the album?\n\n[Brian Eno] Yes, it was quite interesting doing that. When you're running it as an ephemeral piece, you have quite different considerations. If there is something that is a bit doubtful or odd, you think, OK, that's just in the nature of the piece and now it's passed and we're somewhere else. Whereas if you're thinking of it as a record that people are going to listen to again and again, what philosophy do you take? Choose just a random amount of time? Could have done that. Just do several of them and fix them together? Is that faking it? These are very interesting philosophical questions.\n\n[Philip Sherburne] Which approach did you follow?\n\n[Brian Eno] A hybrid approach. I generated 11 pieces of the length I'd set the piece to be and I had them all in my iTunes on random shuffle, so I would be listening at night, doing other things, and as one ran through, I would think, That was a nice one, I particularly like the second half. So then I would make a note. I did this for quite a few evenings. There were two that I really liked. On one, the last 40 minutes of it were lovely, and on another, the first 25 minutes of it were really nice. So I thought, This is a studio, I'm making a record. I'll edit them together! It was like the birth of rock'n'roll. I'm allowed to do that! It's not cheating. It was quite a bit of jiggery-pokery to find a place I could do it, but the result is two pieces stuck together. |author=Philip Sherburne / Brian Eno |source=A Conversation With Brian Eno About Ambient Music<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/interview/10023-a-conversation-with-brian-eno-about-ambient-music/|title=A Conversation With Brian Eno About Ambient Music \u2013 Pitchfork|website=Pitchfork.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>}}\n\n===Artworks: Light Boxes===\nEno's \"light boxes\" utilise advances in LED technology that has enabled him to re-imagine his ziggurat light paintings - and early light boxes as featured in [[Kite Stories]] (1999) - for the domestic environment. The light boxes feature slowly changing combinations of colour fields that draw attention differently to the shapes outlined by delineating structures within. As the paintings slowly evolve each passing moment is defined differently, drawing the viewer's focus into the present moment. The writer and cultural essayist Michael Bracewell writes that the viewer \"is also encouraged to engage with a generative sensor/aesthetic experience that reflects the ever-changing moods and randomness of life itself\". He likens Eno's art to \"Matisse or Rothko at their most enfolding.\" <ref>Brian Eno - Light Music: Shedding Light. Michael Bracewell. Paul Stolper. {{ISBN|978-0-9552154-9-0}}</ref>\n\nFirst shown commercially at the Paul Stolper Gallery in London (forming the Light Music exhibition in 2016 that included lenticular paintings by Eno),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paulstolper.com/exhibitions/works/85-brian-eno|title=BRIAN ENO EXHIBITION WORKS - PAUL STOLPER - CONTEMPORARY ART GALLERY - LONDON|website=Paulstolper.com|accessdate=16 January 2018}}</ref> 'light boxes' have been shown across the world. They remain in permanent display in both private and public spaces. Recognised for their therapeutic contemplative benefits, Eno's 'light paintings' have been commissioned for specially dedicated places of reflection including in Chelsea and Westminster hospital, the Montefiore Hospital in Hove and a three and a half metre lightbox for the sanctuary room in the Macmillan Horizon Centre in Brighton.\n\n===Obscure Records===\nEno started the Obscure Records label in Britain in 1975 to release works by lesser-known composers. The first group of three releases included his own composition, ''[[Discreet Music]]'', and the now-famous ''The Sinking of the Titanic'' (1969) and ''[[Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet]]'' (1971) by [[Gavin Bryars]]. The second side of ''Discreet Music'' consisted of several versions of [[Canon in D|Pachelbel's Canon]], the composition which Eno had previously chosen to precede Roxy Music's appearances on stage and to which he applied various algorithmic transformations, rendering it almost unrecognisable. Side one consisted of a [[tape loop]] system for generating music from relatively sparse input. These tapes had previously been used as backgrounds in some of his collaborations with Fripp, most notably on ''Evening Star''. Ten albums were released on Obscure, including works by [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]], [[Michael Nyman]], and [[John Cage]].\n\n===Other work===\n[[File:Nigel_Osborne_&_Brian_Eno_at_Mostar_1994-95.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Professor [[Nigel Osborne]] and Brian Eno leading music workshops, Pavarotti centre, Bosnia 1995.<ref name = \"foodoflove\">Nickalls, Susan.

This process [[Recycling|recycles]] various [[Organic matter|organic materials]] otherwise regarded as waste products and produces a [[soil conditioner]] (the ''compost'').\n\nCompost is rich in nutrients. It is used, for example, in [[garden]]s, [[landscaping]], [[horticulture]], [[urban agriculture]] and [[organic farming]]. The compost itself is beneficial for the land in many ways, including as a soil conditioner, a [[fertilizer]], addition of vital [[humus]] or [[humic acids]], and as a natural [[pesticide]] for soil. In [[ecosystems]], compost is useful for erosion control, land and stream reclamation, wetland construction, and as landfill cover (see [[compost uses]]).\n\nAt the simplest level, the process of composting requires making a heap of wet organic matter (also called [[green waste]]), such as leaves, grass, and food scraps, and waiting for the materials to break down into [[humus]] after a period of months. However, composting can also take place as a multi-step, closely monitored process with measured inputs of water, air, and carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials. The [[decomposition]] process is aided by shredding the plant matter, adding water and ensuring proper aeration by regularly turning the mixture when open piles or \"windrows\" are used. [[Fungus|Fungi]], [[earthworm]]s and other [[detritivore]]s further break up the material. Bacteria requiring oxygen to function ([[aerobic bacteria]]) and fungi manage the chemical process by converting the inputs into heat, [[carbon dioxide]], and [[ammonium]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Fundamentals==\n[[File:Composting in the Escuela Barreales.jpg|thumb|Home compost barrel]]\n[[File:Compost pile.JPG|thumb|Materials in a compost pile]]\n[[File:Food-scraps-compost.jpg|thumb|Food scraps compost heap]]\n\nComposting is an ''aerobic method'' (meaning that it requires the presence of air) of decomposing organic solid wastes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3BhSAAAAMAAJ&q=Human+waste+can+also+be+added+as+an+input+to+the+composting+process+since+human+waste+is+a+nitrogen-rich+organic+material&dq=Human+waste+can+also+be+added+as+an+input+to+the+composting+process+since+human+waste+is+a+nitrogen-rich+organic+material|title=Introduction to Environmental Engineering and Science|last=Masters|first=Gilbert M.|date=1997|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780131553842|language=en}}</ref> It can therefore be used to recycle organic material.

There are many types of microorganisms found in active compost of which the most common are:<ref name=\"cornell\">{{cite web|url=http://compost.css.cornell.edu/microorg.html|title=Composting - Compost Microorganisms|work=[[Cornell University]]|accessdate=6 October 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Bacteria]]- The most numerous of all the [[microorganism]]s found in compost.

Many advocate that compost can be made in 2 to 3 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vric.ucdavis.edu/pdf/compost_rapidcompost.pdf|title=The Rapid Compost Method by Robert Raabe, Professor of Plant Pathology, Berkeley|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref> Many such short processes involve a few changes to traditional methods, including smaller, more homogenized pieces in the compost, controlling carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N) at 30 to 1 or less, and monitoring the moisture level more carefully. However, none of these parameters differ significantly from the early writings of compost researchers, suggesting that, in fact, modern composting has not made significant advances over the traditional methods that take a few months to work. For this reason and others, many scientists who deal with carbon transformations are skeptical that there is a \"super-charged\" way to get nature to make compost rapidly. {{citation needed|reason=Very old reference, find a better one|date=May 2015}}\n\nBoth sides may be right to some extent. The bacterial activity in rapid high heat methods breaks down the material to the extent that pathogens and seeds are destroyed, and the original feedstock is unrecognizable. At this stage, the compost can be used to prepare fields or other planting areas.  However, most professionals recommend that the compost be given time to cure before using in a nursery for starting seeds or growing young plants. The curing time allows fungi to continue the decomposition process and eliminating [[phytotoxic]] substances.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nAn alternative approach is anaerobic fermentation, known as [[#Bokashi|bokashi]]. It retains carbon bonds, is faster than decomposition, and for application to soil requires only rapid but thorough aeration rather than curing. It depends on sufficient carbohydrates in the treated material.\n\n===Pathogen removal===\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\nComposting can destroy [[pathogen]]s or unwanted [[seed]]s. Unwanted living plants (or [[weed]]s) can be discouraged by [[Mulch#Mulching (composting) over unwanted plants|covering with mulch/compost]]. The \"[[biopesticide|microbial pesticides]]\" in compost may include [[thermophile]]s and [[mesophile]]s.\n\nThermophilic (high-temperature) composting is well known to destroy many seeds and nearly all types of pathogens (exceptions may include [[prion]]s). The [[Disinfection|sanitizing]] qualities of ([[thermophilic]]) composting are desirable where there is a high likelihood of pathogens, such as with [[manure]].\n\n== Materials that can be composted ==\nComposting is a process used for [[resource recovery]]. It can [[recycle]] an unwanted by-product from another process (a [[waste]]) into a useful new product.\n\n=== Organic solid waste (green waste) ===\n[[File:Spontaneous combustion of compost pile.jpg|thumb|A large compost pile that is steaming with the heat generated by [[thermophile|thermophilic]] microorganisms.]]\n\nComposting is a process for converting decomposable organic materials into useful stable products. Therefore, valuable [[landfill]] space can be used for other wastes by composting these materials rather than dumping them on landfills. It may however be difficult to control inert and plastics contamination from [[municipal solid waste]].\n\nCo-composting is a technique that processes organic solid waste together with other input materials such as dewatered [[fecal sludge]] or [[sewage sludge]].<ref name=\"tilley2\" />\n\nIndustrial composting systems are being installed to treat organic solid waste and recycle it rather than landfilling it. It is one example of an [[advanced waste processing systems|advanced waste processing system]]. Mechanical sorting of mixed waste streams combined with [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] digestion or in-vessel composting is called [[mechanical biological treatment]]. It is increasingly being used in developed countries due to regulations controlling the amount of organic matter allowed in landfills. Treating [[biodegradable waste]] before it enters a landfill reduces [[global warming]] from fugitive [[methane]]; untreated waste breaks down anaerobically in a landfill, producing [[landfill gas]] that contains [[atmospheric methane|methane]], a potent [[greenhouse gas]].\n\n===Animal manure and bedding===\nOn many farms, the basic composting ingredients are animal [[manure]] generated on the farm and bedding. Straw and sawdust are common bedding materials. Non-traditional bedding materials are also used, including newspaper and chopped cardboard. The amount of manure composted on a livestock farm is often determined by cleaning schedules, land availability, and weather conditions. Each type of manure has its own physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. Cattle and horse manures, when mixed with bedding, possess good qualities for composting. Swine manure, which is very wet and usually not mixed with bedding material, must be mixed with straw or similar raw materials. Poultry manure also must be blended with carbonaceous materials - those low in nitrogen preferred, such as sawdust or straw.<ref>Dougherty, Mark. (1999). Field Guide to On-Farm Composting. Ithaca, New York: Natural Resource, Agriculture, and Engineering Service.</ref>\n\n=== Human waste and sewage sludge ===\n{{Further|Reuse of human waste}}\n[[Human waste]] can  be added as an input to the composting process since human excreta is a nitrogen-rich organic material. It can be either composted directly, as in [[composting toilets]], or indirectly (as [[sewage sludge]]), after it has undergone treatment in a [[Sewage treatment|sewage treatment plant]].  Feces contain a wide range of microorganisms including bacteria, viruses and parasitic worms and its use in home composting can pose significant health risks.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Domestic waste composting facilities: a review of human health risks.|journal = Environment International|volume = 35|issue = 2|pages = 382\u20139|date = August 2012|pmid = 18701167|last1 = Domingo|first1 = J.

Unlike feces, urine does not attract disease-spreading flies (such as [[Housefly|houseflies]] or [[Calliphoridae|blowflies]]), and it does not contain the most hardy of pathogens, such as [[parasitic worm]] eggs.\n\n==Uses==\n{{Main|Uses of compost}}\nCompost can be used as an additive to soil, or other matrices such as [[coir]] and [[peat]], as a [[tilth]] improver, supplying humus and nutrients. It provides a rich ''growing medium'' as absorbent material (porous). This material contains moisture and soluble minerals, which provides support and [[nutrient]]s. Although it is rarely used alone, plants can flourish from mixed [[soil]], [[sand]], grit, bark chips, [[vermiculite]], [[perlite]], or [[clay]] granules to produce [[loam]]. Compost can be tilled directly into the soil or growing medium to boost the level of organic matter and the overall fertility of the soil. Compost that is ready to be used as an additive is dark brown or even black with an earthy smell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/wastes/conserve/rrr/greenscapes/pubs/asla-soil.pdf|title=Reduce, Reuse, Recycle - US EPA|first=US|last=EPA,OSWER,ORCR|website=US EPA|accessdate=21 December 2017|date=2013-04-16}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, direct seeding into a compost is not recommended due to the speed with which it may dry and the possible presence of [[phytotoxin]]s in immature compost that may inhibit germination,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Morel | first1 = P. | last2 = Guillemain | first2 = G. | year = 2004 | title = Assessment of the possible phytotoxicity of a substrate using an easy and representative biotest | url = | journal = Acta Horticulturae | volume = | issue = 644| pages = 417\u2013423 | doi = 10.17660/ActaHortic.2004.644.55 }}</ref><ref>It\u00e4vaara et al.

It [[Homolactic fermentation|ferments]] (rather than decomposes) the input organic matter and feeds the result to the [[soil food web]] (rather than producing a soil conditioner). The process involves adding [[Lactobacillus|''Lactobacilli'']] to the input in an airtight container kept at normal room temperature. These bacteria ferment [[carbohydrate]]s to [[lactic acid]], which preserves the input. After this is complete the preserve is mixed into soil, converting the lactic acid to [[pyruvate]], which enables soil life to consume the result.\n\nBokashi is typically applied to [[food waste]] from households, workplaces and catering establishments, because such waste normally holds a good proportion of carbohydrates; it is also applied to other organic waste by supplementing carbohydrates. Household containers (\"bokashi bins\") typically give a batch size of {{convert|5\u201310|kg}}, accumulated over a few weeks. In horticultural settings batches can be orders of magnitude greater.[[File:Bokashi bin - inside.JPG|thumb|Inside a recently started bokashi bin. Food scraps are raised on a perforated plate (to drain runoff) and are partly covered by a layer of bran inoculated with ''Lactobacilli'']]\n\nBokashi offers several advantages:\n* Fermentation retains all the original carbon and energy. (In comparison, composting loses at least 50% of these and 75% or more in amateur use; composting also loses nitrogen, a [[Plant nutrition|macronutrient]] of plants, by emitting ammonia and the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide.)<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Practical Handbook of Compost Engineering|last=Haug|first=Roger Tim|publisher=Lewis Publishers|year=1993|isbn=0-87371-373-7|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n* Virtually the full range of food waste is accepted, without the exclusions of composting. The exception is large bones.\n* Being airtight, the container inherently traps smells, and when opened the smell of fermentation is far less offensive than decomposition. Hence bokashi bins usually operate indoors, in or near kitchens.\n* Similarly the container neither attracts insect pests nor allows them ingress.\n* The process is inherently hygienic because lactic acid is a natural [[bactericide]] and anti-[[pathogen]]; even its own fermentation is self-limiting.\n* Both preservation and consumption complete within a few weeks rather than months.\n* The preserve can be stored until needed, for example if ground is frozen or waterlogged.\n* The increased activity of the soil food web improves the soil texture, especially by worm action - in effect this is in-soil [[vermicomposting]].\n\nThe importance of the first advantage should not be underestimated: the mass of any [[ecosystem]] depends on the energy it captures. Plants depend upon the soil ecosystem making nutrients available within [[Soil#Water|soil water]]. Therefore, the richer the ecosystem, the richer the plants.

This process [[Recycling|recycles]] various [[Organic matter|organic materials]] otherwise regarded as waste products and produces a [[soil conditioner]] (the ''compost'').\n\nCompost is rich in nutrients. It is used, for example, in [[garden]]s, [[landscaping]], [[horticulture]], [[urban agriculture]] and [[organic farming]]. The compost itself is beneficial for the land in many ways, including as a soil conditioner, a [[fertilizer]], addition of vital [[humus]] or [[humic acids]], and as a natural [[pesticide]] for soil. In [[ecosystems]], compost is useful for erosion control, land and stream reclamation, wetland construction, and as landfill cover (see [[compost uses]]).\n\nAt the simplest level, the process of composting requires making a heap of wet organic matter (also called [[green waste]]), such as leaves, grass, and food scraps, and waiting for the materials to break down into [[humus]] after a period of months. However, composting can also take place as a multi-step, closely monitored process with measured inputs of water, air, and carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials. The [[decomposition]] process is aided by shredding the plant matter, adding water and ensuring proper aeration by regularly turning the mixture when open piles or \"windrows\" are used. [[Fungus|Fungi]], [[earthworm]]s and other [[detritivore]]s further break up the material. Bacteria requiring oxygen to function ([[aerobic bacteria]]) and fungi manage the chemical process by converting the inputs into heat, [[carbon dioxide]], and [[ammonium]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Fundamentals==\n[[File:Composting in the Escuela Barreales.jpg|thumb|Home compost barrel]]\n[[File:Compost pile.JPG|thumb|Materials in a compost pile]]\n[[File:Food-scraps-compost.jpg|thumb|Food scraps compost heap]]\n\nComposting is an ''aerobic method'' (meaning that it requires the presence of air) of decomposing organic solid wastes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3BhSAAAAMAAJ&q=Human+waste+can+also+be+added+as+an+input+to+the+composting+process+since+human+waste+is+a+nitrogen-rich+organic+material&dq=Human+waste+can+also+be+added+as+an+input+to+the+composting+process+since+human+waste+is+a+nitrogen-rich+organic+material|title=Introduction to Environmental Engineering and Science|last=Masters|first=Gilbert M.|date=1997|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780131553842|language=en}}</ref> It can therefore be used to recycle organic material.

However, none of these parameters differ significantly from the early writings of compost researchers, suggesting that, in fact, modern composting has not made significant advances over the traditional methods that take a few months to work. For this reason and others, many scientists who deal with carbon transformations are skeptical that there is a \"super-charged\" way to get nature to make compost rapidly. {{citation needed|reason=Very old reference, find a better one|date=May 2015}}\n\nBoth sides may be right to some extent. The bacterial activity in rapid high heat methods breaks down the material to the extent that pathogens and seeds are destroyed, and the original feedstock is unrecognizable. At this stage, the compost can be used to prepare fields or other planting areas.  However, most professionals recommend that the compost be given time to cure before using in a nursery for starting seeds or growing young plants. The curing time allows fungi to continue the decomposition process and eliminating [[phytotoxic]] substances.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nAn alternative approach is anaerobic fermentation, known as [[#Bokashi|bokashi]]. It retains carbon bonds, is faster than decomposition, and for application to soil requires only rapid but thorough aeration rather than curing. It depends on sufficient carbohydrates in the treated material.\n\n===Pathogen removal===\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\nComposting can destroy [[pathogen]]s or unwanted [[seed]]s.

It may however be difficult to control inert and plastics contamination from [[municipal solid waste]].\n\nCo-composting is a technique that processes organic solid waste together with other input materials such as dewatered [[fecal sludge]] or [[sewage sludge]].<ref name=\"tilley2\" />\n\nIndustrial composting systems are being installed to treat organic solid waste and recycle it rather than landfilling it. It is one example of an [[advanced waste processing systems|advanced waste processing system]]. Mechanical sorting of mixed waste streams combined with [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] digestion or in-vessel composting is called [[mechanical biological treatment]]. It is increasingly being used in developed countries due to regulations controlling the amount of organic matter allowed in landfills. Treating [[biodegradable waste]] before it enters a landfill reduces [[global warming]] from fugitive [[methane]]; untreated waste breaks down anaerobically in a landfill, producing [[landfill gas]] that contains [[atmospheric methane|methane]], a potent [[greenhouse gas]].\n\n===Animal manure and bedding===\nOn many farms, the basic composting ingredients are animal [[manure]] generated on the farm and bedding. Straw and sawdust are common bedding materials. Non-traditional bedding materials are also used, including newspaper and chopped cardboard. The amount of manure composted on a livestock farm is often determined by cleaning schedules, land availability, and weather conditions. Each type of manure has its own physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. Cattle and horse manures, when mixed with bedding, possess good qualities for composting. Swine manure, which is very wet and usually not mixed with bedding material, must be mixed with straw or similar raw materials. Poultry manure also must be blended with carbonaceous materials - those low in nitrogen preferred, such as sawdust or straw.<ref>Dougherty, Mark. (1999). Field Guide to On-Farm Composting. Ithaca, New York: Natural Resource, Agriculture, and Engineering Service.</ref>\n\n=== Human waste and sewage sludge ===\n{{Further|Reuse of human waste}}\n[[Human waste]] can  be added as an input to the composting process since human excreta is a nitrogen-rich organic material. It can be either composted directly, as in [[composting toilets]], or indirectly (as [[sewage sludge]]), after it has undergone treatment in a [[Sewage treatment|sewage treatment plant]].  Feces contain a wide range of microorganisms including bacteria, viruses and parasitic worms and its use in home composting can pose significant health risks.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Domestic waste composting facilities: a review of human health risks.|journal = Environment International|volume = 35|issue = 2|pages = 382\u20139|date = August 2012|pmid = 18701167|last1 = Domingo|first1 = J.

Unlike feces, urine does not attract disease-spreading flies (such as [[Housefly|houseflies]] or [[Calliphoridae|blowflies]]), and it does not contain the most hardy of pathogens, such as [[parasitic worm]] eggs.\n\n==Uses==\n{{Main|Uses of compost}}\nCompost can be used as an additive to soil, or other matrices such as [[coir]] and [[peat]], as a [[tilth]] improver, supplying humus and nutrients. It provides a rich ''growing medium'' as absorbent material (porous). This material contains moisture and soluble minerals, which provides support and [[nutrient]]s. Although it is rarely used alone, plants can flourish from mixed [[soil]], [[sand]], grit, bark chips, [[vermiculite]], [[perlite]], or [[clay]] granules to produce [[loam]]. Compost can be tilled directly into the soil or growing medium to boost the level of organic matter and the overall fertility of the soil. Compost that is ready to be used as an additive is dark brown or even black with an earthy smell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/wastes/conserve/rrr/greenscapes/pubs/asla-soil.pdf|title=Reduce, Reuse, Recycle - US EPA|first=US|last=EPA,OSWER,ORCR|website=US EPA|accessdate=21 December 2017|date=2013-04-16}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, direct seeding into a compost is not recommended due to the speed with which it may dry and the possible presence of [[phytotoxin]]s in immature compost that may inhibit germination,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Morel | first1 = P. | last2 = Guillemain | first2 = G. | year = 2004 | title = Assessment of the possible phytotoxicity of a substrate using an easy and representative biotest | url = | journal = Acta Horticulturae | volume = | issue = 644| pages = 417\u2013423 | doi = 10.17660/ActaHortic.2004.644.55 }}</ref><ref>It\u00e4vaara et al.

It [[Homolactic fermentation|ferments]] (rather than decomposes) the input organic matter and feeds the result to the [[soil food web]] (rather than producing a soil conditioner). The process involves adding [[Lactobacillus|''Lactobacilli'']] to the input in an airtight container kept at normal room temperature. These bacteria ferment [[carbohydrate]]s to [[lactic acid]], which preserves the input. After this is complete the preserve is mixed into soil, converting the lactic acid to [[pyruvate]], which enables soil life to consume the result.\n\nBokashi is typically applied to [[food waste]] from households, workplaces and catering establishments, because such waste normally holds a good proportion of carbohydrates; it is also applied to other organic waste by supplementing carbohydrates. Household containers (\"bokashi bins\") typically give a batch size of {{convert|5\u201310|kg}}, accumulated over a few weeks. In horticultural settings batches can be orders of magnitude greater.[[File:Bokashi bin - inside.JPG|thumb|Inside a recently started bokashi bin. Food scraps are raised on a perforated plate (to drain runoff) and are partly covered by a layer of bran inoculated with ''Lactobacilli'']]\n\nBokashi offers several advantages:\n* Fermentation retains all the original carbon and energy. (In comparison, composting loses at least 50% of these and 75% or more in amateur use; composting also loses nitrogen, a [[Plant nutrition|macronutrient]] of plants, by emitting ammonia and the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide.)<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Practical Handbook of Compost Engineering|last=Haug|first=Roger Tim|publisher=Lewis Publishers|year=1993|isbn=0-87371-373-7|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n* Virtually the full range of food waste is accepted, without the exclusions of composting. The exception is large bones.\n* Being airtight, the container inherently traps smells, and when opened the smell of fermentation is far less offensive than decomposition. Hence bokashi bins usually operate indoors, in or near kitchens.\n* Similarly the container neither attracts insect pests nor allows them ingress.\n* The process is inherently hygienic because lactic acid is a natural [[bactericide]] and anti-[[pathogen]]; even its own fermentation is self-limiting.\n* Both preservation and consumption complete within a few weeks rather than months.\n* The preserve can be stored until needed, for example if ground is frozen or waterlogged.\n* The increased activity of the soil food web improves the soil texture, especially by worm action - in effect this is in-soil [[vermicomposting]].\n\nThe importance of the first advantage should not be underestimated: the mass of any [[ecosystem]] depends on the energy it captures. Plants depend upon the soil ecosystem making nutrients available within [[Soil#Water|soil water]]. Therefore, the richer the ecosystem, the richer the plants. (Plants can also take up nutrients from added chemicals, but these are at odds with the purpose of composting).\n\n=== Other systems at household level===\n==== {{anchor|H\u00fcgelkultur}}H\u00fcgelkultur (raised garden beds or mounds) ====\n[[File:End point (4315712587).jpg|thumb|upright|An almost completed H\u00fcgelkultur bed; the bed does not have soil on it yet.]]\n{{Main|H\u00fcgelkultur}}\nThe practice of making raised garden beds or mounds filled with rotting wood is also called ''h\u00fcgelkultur'' in German.<ref name=\"richsoil.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.richsoil.com/hugelkultur/ |title=hugelkultur: the ultimate raised garden beds |publisher=Richsoil.com |date=2007-07-27 |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref><ref name=\"permaculture.org.au\">{{cite web|url=http://permaculture.org.au/2010/08/03/the-art-and-science-of-making-a-hugelkultur-bed-transforming-woody-debris-into-a-garden-resource/ |title=The Art and Science of Making a Hugelkultur Bed - Transforming Woody Debris into a Garden Resource Permaculture Research Institute - Permaculture Forums, Courses, Information & News |date= 2010-08-03|accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref> It is in effect creating a [[nurse log]] that is covered with soil.\n\nBenefits of ''h\u00fcgelkultur'' garden beds include water retention and warming of soil.<ref name=\"richsoil.com\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://permaculture.org.au/2012/01/04/hugelkultur-composting-whole-trees-with-ease/#more-6825 |title=Hugelkultur: Composting Whole Trees With Ease Permaculture Research Institute - Permaculture Forums, Courses, Information & News |date= 2012-01-04|accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref> Buried wood acts like a [[sponge (material)|sponge]] as it decomposes, able to capture water and store it for later use by crops planted on top of the ''h\u00fcgelkultur'' bed.<ref name=\"richsoil.com\" /><ref>Hemenway, Toby (2009).

Januar 1921, 67. Jahrgang, Nr. 2, S. 4</ref> Early frequent citations for propounding composting within farming are for the German-speaking world [[Rudolf Steiner]], founder of a farming method called [[biodynamics]], and [[Annie Franc\u00e9-Harrar]], who was appointed on behalf of the government in [[Mexico]] and supported the country 1950\u20131958 to set up a large humus organization in the fight against erosion and [[soil degradation]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gETbAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86&dq=Annie+Franc%C3%A9-Harrar+compost#v=onepage&q=Annie%20Franc%C3%A9-Harrar%20compost&f=false|title=A History of the Garden in Fifty Tools|last=Laws|first=Bill|date=2014-06-19|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226139937|location=|pages=86|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the English-speaking world it was [[Sir Albert Howard]] who worked extensively in [[India]] on sustainable practices and [[Lady Eve Balfour]] who was a huge proponent of composting. Composting was imported to America by various followers of these early European movements by the likes of [[Jerome Irving Rodale|J.I. Rodale]] (founder of Rodale Organic Gardening), E.E. Pfeiffer (who developed scientific practices in biodynamic farming), [[Paul K. Keene|Paul Keene]] (founder of Walnut Acres in Pennsylvania), and [[Scott Nearing|Scott]] and [[Helen Nearing]] (who inspired the [[back-to-the-land movement]] of the 1960s). Coincidentally, some of the above met briefly in India - all were quite influential in the U.S. from the 1960s into the 1980s.\n\n== Society and culture ==\n=== Terminology ===\nThe term \"composting\" is used worldwide with differing meanings.\n\n\"Humanure\" is a [[portmanteau]] of ''human'' and ''manure'', designating human excrement ([[feces]] and [[urine]]) that is recycled via composting for agricultural purposes. The term was first used in 1994 in a book by Joseph Jenkins that advocates the use of this [[organic material|organic]] soil amendment.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|url=http://www.humanurehandbook.com|title=The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure|last=Jenkins|first=J.C.|publisher=Joseph Jenkins, Inc.; 3rd edition|year=2005|isbn=978-0-9644258-3-5|location=Grove City, PA|page=255|accessdate=April 2011}}</ref> The term humanure is used by compost enthusiasts in the United States but not widely used elsewhere.<ref name=\"tilley2\" /> Because the term \"humanure\" has no authoritative definition it is subject to various uses. News reporters may use the term also for [[sewage sludge]] or [[biosolids]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourottawaregion.com/feature/article/1224782--humanure-dumping-sickens-homeowner|title='Humanure' dumping sickens homeowner|author=Courtney Symons|date=13 October 2011|work=YourOttawaRegion|publisher=Metroland Media Group Ltd.|accessdate=16 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Carbon farming]]\n* [[Organic farming]]\n* [[Permaculture]]\n* [[Soil science]]\n* [[Sustainable agriculture]]\n* [[Terra preta]]\n* [[Urban agriculture]]\n* [[Waste sorting]]\n\n===Related lists===\n* [[List of composting systems]]\n* [[List of environment topics]]\n* [[List of sustainable agriculture topics]]\n* [[List of organic gardening and farming topics]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{commons category|Compost}}\n{{Wikibooks|Category:Composting}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Agriculture and Agronomy|Gardening|Ecology|Environment}}\n{{recycling}}\n{{waste}}\n{{Horticulture and Gardening}}\n{{PlantMineralDeficiency}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Composting| ]]\n[[Category:Organic fertilizers]]\n[[Category:Waste management]]\n[[Category:Gardening aids]]\n[[Category:Sanitation]]\n[[Category:Soil improvers]]\n[[Category:Soil]]\n[[Category:Sustainable food system]]\n", "name_user": "Montaukgirl21", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compost"}

In common with co-protagonist Agent [[Pete Lattimer]] (Eddie McClintock), Agent Bering is a [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]] agent. Both have been seconded to the titular Warehouse 13, where their work involves collecting artifacts, under conditions of highest classification secrecy. In opposition to her partner's happy-go-lucky attitude and reliance on intuition, Myka is smart, organized, and has a scrupulous eye for detail.\n\n==Character history==\nBering (born c.1982) is from [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], [[Colorado]], where her parents live. Early on in her life, Myka's parents open a bookstore called, \"Bering and Sons,\" even though she has no brothers; the 'and Sons' is only added to make the establishment sound classier.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Pilot|episodelink=Warehouse 13 (season 1)#ep1|series=Warehouse 13|network=[[Syfy]]|airdate=July 7, 2009|season=1|number=1|minutes=37:53}}</ref> She has one sister, Tracy, who Myka describes as \"the pretty one\" that all the boys were crazy about.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Age Before Beauty|episodelink=Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep16|series=Warehouse 13|network=[[Syfy]]|airdate=July 27, 2010|season=1|number=4|minutes=26:30}}</ref> Unlike her sister, Myka is a tomboy, and thus, instead of growing up playing with [[Barbies]], was a member of [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts]]. As a teen one of her hobbies is [[fencing]]. She also enjoys books and is an avid reader. Myka attended Lincoln High School in Colorado Springs, and graduated in 2000. She is a college graduate, and was [[Pre-medical|Pre-med]] and [[Pre-law]] at some point before being recruited into the Secret Service; at least one of these qualifications was obtained at the University of Colorado<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Magnetism|episodelink=Warehouse 13 (season 1)#ep3|series=Warehouse 13|network=[[Syfy]]|airdate=July 21, 2009|season=1|number=3|minutes=6:29}}</ref> She has at least two tattoos, one on her right ankle<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Duped|episodelink=Warehouse 13 (season 1)#ep8|series=Warehouse 13|network=[[Syfy]]|airdate=August 25, 2009|season=1|number=8|minutes=9:56}}</ref> and another on the inside.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Age Before Beauty|episodelink=Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep16|series=Warehouse 13|network=[[Syfy]]|airdate=July 27, 2010|season=2|number=4|minutes=11:57}}</ref>\n\nOrganized and focused, Myka believes in hard work, solid planning and steadfast execution. She never met a meticulously detailed mission outline she didn't like, and her attention to minutiae leads to her status as a rising star in the Secret Service despite a classified \"situation\" in Denver, Colorado. Reassigned to Washington, DC, Myka serves as an agent on presidential security detail.\n\nAn order dated May 11, 2009 is sent to Chief Supervisor [[List of Warehouse 13 characters#Daniel Dickinson|Daniel Dickinson]], Myka's boss, ordering her immediate transfer to an undisclosed location from her branch in presidential security. The transfer is classified as top secret and the authorization comes from a single name, \"Frederic.\"<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Pilot|episodelink=Warehouse 13 (season 1)#ep1|series=Warehouse 13|network=[[Syfy]]|airdate=July 7, 2009|season=1|number=1|minutes=23:06}}</ref> Following the instructions given to her, Myka finds herself in the [[Badlands Wilderness|badlands]] of [[South Dakota]] assigned as an agent to Warehouse 13 with a new boss, [[Arthur \"Artie\" Nielsen|Artie Nielsen]], and a new partner, Pete Lattimer. Her job is to gather and protect mysterious and powerful artifacts that threaten the world.\n\nThe new assignment is not the career path she envisioned, and thus she initially resists. However, over time she learns the importance of the job and grows to enjoy the work and the companionship of her fellow agents. In the season 2 episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep23|Buried]]\", Myka realizes the warehouse is her happiest place.\n\nBeginning with the season 2 episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep19|For the Team]]\", Myka builds a relationship with the previously de-bronzed [[Helena G. Wells]]. Helena eventually wins Myka over and gains an ally in her bid to be reinstated as a warehouse agent.  In the season 2 finale, \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep24|Reset]]\", Myka's trust is betrayed when Helena uses the Warehouse to acquire the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Trident]], the world's first weapon of mass destruction. Myka plays a pivotal role in her capture, but not before Wells nearly causes a planetary disaster.\n\nShaken by her lapse in judgment concerning H.G. Wells, and filled with doubt about her future effectiveness as warehouse agent, Myka resigns from her job \u2013 an obviously painful decision for her. At the start of season three, Myka is back in Colorado working at her father's bookstore.  After Pete comes to Myka for assistance solving a new case, she returns to the Warehouse and is reinstated to her former position.\n\n{{Expand section|date=June 2013}}\n\nIn season 4 episode [[What Matters Most]], Myka is diagnosed with [[ovarian cancer]] during the physical that all the agents must take part in.\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nMyka has received training from both civilian law enforcement and the Secret Service in firearms, personal protection, and investigation. Reluctant to rely solely gut instinct, she routinely advocates using formal deduction and investigative work; as such, her partners and coworkers note that her \"by the book\" mentality and professionalism has made her exceptional at closing cases, and why many of the people she interviews confess due to overwhelming evidence. As a warehouse agent, she has also displayed extensive formal knowledge, including specific knowledge in literature, history, science, and mathematics, making her the primary investigator in the field.\n\nMyka's biggest asset is her attention to detail; she is cited as having a photographic memory in the episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep15|Beyond Our Control]]\", being able to recall minute details from the Farnsworth schematics to repair a projector artifact. Myka is an expert martial artist, although the specific discipline she studied is never specified. She is also adept at sword fighting, saying \"some girls played with [[Barbie Doll|Barbies]], other girls took [[fencing]] lessons.\" In addition to English, she speaks French, Russian, Japanese and Latin, and reads at least some Arabic, Chinese and Portuguese.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=A New Hope|episodelink=Warehouse 13 (season 4)#ep1|series=Warehouse 13|network=[[Syfy]]|airdate=July 23, 2012|season=4|number=1|minutes=7:40}}</ref> In a deleted scene from the episode \"Vendetta\" she is heard telling Artie in the background that she speaks French, Italian, and Spanish.\n\nThe warehouse regents also infer that Myka's unique mix of training, deduction, and nearly flawless memory makes her uniquely qualified for working with artifacts, and a natural counterbalance to Agent Pete Lattimer. While Pete is more focused on people and the human dimension to artifact recovery, Myka focuses on results, facts, and fairness. As such, Myke is intensely dedicated to the mission, even at the cost of great personal sacrifice.\n\n==Relationships==\nAside from her past love affair with Sam Martino, there is little evidence of close personal relationships in Myka's past prior to her arrival at Warehouse 13.  As we see glimpses into her past, she is portrayed as a person who is somewhat cold and distant from those around her.  In the episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep16|Age Before Beauty]]\", we learn that Myka was the unpopular sibling, her sister being the well-liked one.  In \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep20|Merge with Caution]]\", when Myka arrives at her ten-year high school reunion, she is not well remembered.  While attending a reunion social gathering, we see Myka sitting alone at the bar drinking vodka tonics.  Aside from a brief encounter with Kurt Smoller, there is no interaction between her and her former classmates.  Myka even turns down an offer from Kurt to join the group of friends with whom he is sitting, hinting that her past association with Kurt's friends was unpleasant. In the episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep38|The Greatest Gift]]\" we see Myka in an alternate reality, brought about by Pete's interaction with an artifact, where she is a Secret Service agent still working in Washington, D.C.  Pete finds Myka sitting alone in a bar on Christmas Eve and tries to convince her that they're partners in another reality.  Pete tells her that ''his'' Myka is surrounded by people who love her, to which she responds, \"I have friends\", but it is clear Myka realizes that she really doesn't have any true friends.\n\nThroughout season one Myka gradually develops close relationships with her new Warehouse colleagues.  For the first time in her life, Myka builds bonds of friendship and love with those who surround her.  The coming together as a family of Myka, Pete, Artie, Claudia and Leena is a theme that runs throughout the second season.<ref>Jack Kenny, Season 2 DVD, Disc 2, Video Blog \"What's New For Season 2\"</ref>  In the season 3 episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep27|Trials]]\", Myka explains to the Regents her reason for returning to the Warehouse... \"The world has joy in it.  When you find a place that allows you to experience that joy.  When you find people that make you feel safe and loved, like you belong.  You don't walk away from it.  You fight for it.\"\n\n'''Jeannie Bering''' ([[Susan Hogan (actress)|Susan Hogan]]). Myka's mother, Jeannie, appears in the season 1 episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 1)#ep11|Nevermore]]\" and then again briefly in \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep38|The Greatest Gift]]\", though Myka and Jeannie do not interact in the latter episode.  While Myka's problems with her father are well known to audiences of season one, her relationship with Jeannie has gone largely undeveloped.  By all outward appearances, they have a normal mother-daughter relationship.\n\n'''Warren Bering''' ([[Michael Hogan (Canadian actor)|Michael Hogan]]).  Myka's father, Warren, was a very demanding parent, which resulted in a strained and troubled relationship between him and his daughter. In the season 1 episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 1)#ep11|Nevermore]]\", Myka receives word that Warren is dying and rushes to Colorado to see him. It is discovered that he is under the influence of a bifurcated artifact, and is saved when the two parts of the artifact are brought back together. The incident brings Myka and her father back together, allowing them to make amends and begin a renewed relationship.\n\n'''Tracy Bering''' ([[Amy Acker]]).  Myka's younger sister, Tracy, is mentioned in the episodes \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep16|Age Before Beauty]]\" and \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 4)#ep43|No Pain, No Gain]]\".  It is revealed that Myka harbors some jealousy towards her sister because, as Myka explains, \"She's the cheerleader, and the homecoming queen; you know, she was the one that all the boys were crazy about.\"  Pete comforts Myka by telling her that she's a stunningly beautiful woman and that it's her sister who should be jealous. Tracy is first seen in the season 4 episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 4)#ep47|The Ones You Love]]\" when Myka frees her from the influence of an artifact.\n\n'''Kurt Smoller''' ([[Cody Rhodes]]).  In the season 2 episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep20|Merge with Caution]]\", we see that Myka had a high school crush on the captain of the football team, Kurt, who she tutored in math. At their ten-year reunion, chemistry develops between them, though it is really Myka's body inhabited by Pete's mind, which is caused by a body-swapping artifact. After returning to her body, Myka goes to see Kurt and some of the previous day's chemistry still exists. They exchange a kiss and agree to stay in touch.\n\n'''[[List of Warehouse 13 characters#Sam Martino|Sam Martino]]''' ([[Gabriel Hogan]]).  As a Secret Service agent stationed in Denver, Colorado, Myka is partnered with Sam, with whom she builds a romantic relationship.  At the time, Sam is married but separated from his wife.  He is murdered while on assignment and, for some time, Myka feels partly responsible, believing she acted too slowly to save him.  She is stricken with guilt and grief over Sam's death until she acknowledges to herself that she had not been responsible and that Sam had been at fault for not following their plan to corner a criminal named Leo Bock.  In the season 3 episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep32|Past Imperfect]]\", Myka learns that a fellow agent conspired with Leo to murder Sam, aided by an artifact that could temporarily freeze time.  Both Leo and his accomplice are killed, thus finally bringing closure for Myka.\n\n'''Zach Adanto''' (J. August Richard) and '''Jim''' ([[Yancey Arias]]).  Former colleagues at the Denver Secret Service, Zach and Jim worked with Myka on the Leo Bock case.  In \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep32|Past Imperfect]]\", Myka again enlists their help when she spots Leo in Denver while working on an unrelated case.  Although they work together as professionals, it is portrayed that they are not necessarily friendly.  Zach and Jim describe Myka as, \"Still impulsive and emotional\"... \"Classic Myka.\"  It is discovered that Jim was Leo's accomplice in Sam's murder, and in separate shooting incidents, Zach takes the lives of both.\n\n'''[[List of Warehouse 13 characters#Daniel Dickinson|Daniel Dickinson]]''' (Simon Reynolds).  Dickinson is Myka's supervisor at the Washington, D.C. Secret Service.  He considers Myka to be one of his best agents and a rising star, stating that \"she's going places.\"  They maintain a good relationship even after Myka's departure, at least until Artie forces them to sever contact because of the demands of Warehouse security.  Myka is very saddened by Dickinson's death in the season 2 episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep21|Vendetta]]\".\n\n'''[[Pete Lattimer]]''' ([[Eddie McClintock]]).  As co-protagonists, Pete and Myka spend more time on screen together than any other characters.  They initially clash with one another in the \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 1)#ep1|Pilot]]\" episode as they work together on a case in Washington, D.C., but after both are recruited by Mrs. Frederic to work at Warehouse 13, they try to get along.  Myka is at first annoyed by Pete's childlike nature and off-the-cuff style, which clashes with her by-the-book approach; however, after season one, she begins to find Pete's manner less annoying and more endearing.  Over time they draw close and come to discover that their differences make them stronger when paired together.  By the end of season 2, Pete and Myka have become the best of friends.  Pete displays an innate ability to bring out of Myka a happy fun-loving side, rather than always being the uptight and isolated person she was when they first met.<ref name=\"cjanders\">{{Cite web|url=http://io9.com/5864702/warehouse-13s-joanne-kelly-i-would-love-to-see-hg-wells-and-myka-get-together|title=Warehouse 13's Joanne Kelly: \"I would love\" to see H.G. Wells and Myka get together|author=Charlie Jane Anders|publisher=i09.com}}</ref>  In the Season 2 finale \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep24|Reset]]\", upon leaving the Warehouse, Myka writes in her resignation letter that Pete is the big brother she never had. But the way Pete reacts, running out of the Warehouse in a futile attempt to catch her, almost in tears, suggests that he thinks of her as more than a sister.  When she returns in season 3, Myka describes Pete to the Regents as \"an extraordinary partner.\"  In the season 3 episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep28|Love Sick]]\", after waking up naked in bed together with no memory of what happen, both declare, \"I don't think of you that way.\"  Pete reassures Myka that she's his partner and best friend and nothing, not even having sex and forgetting about it, will change that.  They later learn, to Myka's relief, that nothing happened between them. Nevertheless, their relationship continues to evolve in season 4 and 5. By the end of season 5, in the episode \"Endless\" they decide to explore their developing feelings for each other.\n\n'''[[List of Warehouse 13 characters#Mrs. Irene Frederic|Mrs. Frederic]]''' ([[C. C. H. Pounder]]).  Myka's first meeting with Mrs. Frederic takes place off screen, when Myka is recruited to join the Warehouse in the \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 1)#ep1|Pilot]]\" episode.  Mrs. Frederic is a character that doesn't allow close personal friendships to develop between her and the agents that work for her.  Nonetheless, she and Myka are as close to friends as they can be, and there is a strong bond of loyalty and respect between them.  In the episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep26|The New Guy]]\", Mrs. Frederic gets Myka to return to the Warehouse by bringing H. G. Wells to her, where Helena tells Myka, \"Don't walk away from your truth.\"\n\n'''[[Arthur \"Artie\" Nielsen|Artie Nielsen]]''' ([[Saul Rubinek]]).  During much of the first season Myka and Artie have a strained relationship, which is explored in the episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 1)#ep8|Duped]]\".  She believes Artie's secrecy and withholding of information puts her at risk whenever she goes out into the field. In spite of everything, she likes Artie and thinks he's great.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Implosion|episodelink=Warehouse 13 (season 1)#ep7|series=Warehouse 13|network=[[Syfy]]|airdate=August 18, 2009|season=1|number=7|minutes=40:47}}</ref>  After explaining her feelings to him, the relationship improves.  They clash again in season 2 episodes \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep21|Vendetta]]\" and \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep22|Where and When]]\" after Myka advocates for the reinstatement of H. G. Wells, a decision Artie adamantly opposes.  The incident causes friction between them, but the relationship soon returns to normal.  Despite their disagreements, Myka and Artie develop a deep affection for each other, which is frequently on display:  In \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep13|Time Will Tell]]\", Myka reacts with elation upon seeing Artie rise from the ashes of the exploded umbilicus and, in \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep16|Age Before Beauty]]\", Artie is deeply troubled when Myka falls victim to a rapid aging artifact.  We also witness Artie's emotion in \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep26|The New Guy]]\" upon seeing that Myka has returned to the Warehouse, simply uttering \"Good\" with a satisfying smile on his face.\n\n'''(ferret) Pete'''.  Created by an artifact in the \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 1)#ep1|Pilot]]\" episode, Myka adopts a pet ferret, for which she has a soft spot.  It is revealed in the episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 1)#ep8|Duped]]\" that she named the ferret Pete, after her partner, because \"they're both cute but annoying.\"  Ferret Pete has not been seen since the pilot, but is occasionally mentioned.\n\n'''[[Leena (Warehouse 13)|Leena]]''' ([[Genelle Williams]]).  Although Leena is the least developed of the main characters, it is clear she shares a strong bond of affection with the others, and is often seen in a maternal role.  Interaction between her and Myka is always portrayed as friendly and caring.  While in the field, Myka and Pete frequently turn to Leena as a reliable source of information and research.  When off duty at the B&B, Leena is a regular member of the social group. When Leena is killed Myka is one of the most heavily effected other than Artie.\n\n'''[[Claudia Donovan]]''' ([[Allison Scagliotti]]).  Myka has developed a big sister relationship with Claudia, which really began to mature in season 2.  Myka is an important mentor to Claudia on her first field assignment in the season 2 episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep19|For The Team]]\" and tricks her into believing in herself.  Recognizing Claudia's potential, Myka has been very encouraging to her.  Her belief in Claudia is reinforced when Myka writes in her season 2 resignation letter, \"I wish I could be there to see you grow into the amazing woman you're going to become.\"  Myka, as well as the entire Warehouse, often relies on Claudia's inventive ingenuity to devise gadgets to help get out of various predicaments.\n\n'''[[Helena G. Wells]]''' ([[Jaime Murray]]).  Myka's relationship with Helena (aka, H.G.) is likely the most complex of the series.  Initially warned off by Artie from having any interaction with her, Myka begins to build a friendship with Helena in season 2, keeping their interactions a secret from the rest of the Warehouse team.  As seen in the episodes \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep19|For The Team]]\" and \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep21|Vendetta]]\", the two women quickly develop a respect, admiration, and understanding of each other.  Myka is angered and hurt when Helena betrays the Warehouse at the end of season 2, but when she shows remorse for what she has done, Myka again befriends her in season 3. Actress Joanne Kelly has stated that Myka and Helena \"fell in love a little bit.\"<ref>[https://archive.is/20130101190433/http://www.afterellen.com/TV/warehouse-13-star-confirms-the-shows-lesbian-subtext-and-then-some AfterEllen.com, July 25, 2011, retrieved September 8, 2012]</ref>  Their developing mutual love and affection<ref name=\"cjanders\"/> culminates in Helena's self-sacrifice to save Myka, Pete and Artie from an explosion in the season 3 finale, \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep37|Stand]]\".  Myka is visibly heartbroken over the death of Helena.  Helena's sacrifice and death are wiped from existence in the season 4 premiere, \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 4)#ep39|A New Hope]]\", when Artie uses a failsafe artifact to prevent the explosion and reverse the Warehouse's destruction.\n\n'''[[List of Warehouse 13 characters#Steve Jinks|Steve Jinks]]''' ([[Aaron Ashmore]]).  There is little on screen interaction between Myka and Steve, as Steve is mainly seen as a partner to Claudia.  It is portrayed, however, that they share a friendship and good working relationship, with Steve becoming a member of the Warehouse family.  Myka is grief-stricken over Steve's murder in the season 3 episodes \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep36|Emily Lake]]\" and \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep37|Stand]]\". She is also the first to figure out his connection to Claudia and the artifact in Season 4 indicating she pays more attention to him than the others do (except Claudia).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Warehouse 13}}\n*{{Official website|http://www.syfy.com/warehouse13}}\n\n{{Warehouse 13}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bering, Myka}}\n[[Category:Warehouse 13 characters]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2009]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Colorado]]\n[[Category:Fictional Secret Service personnel]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{notability|date=July 2012}}\n{{in-universe|date=July 2012}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox character\n| name             = Myka Bering\n| series           = [[Warehouse 13]]\n| image            = \n| caption          = \n| first            = \"[[Pilot (Warehouse 13)|Pilot]]\"\n| last             = \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 5)#ep6|Endless]]\"\n| creator          = [[Jane Espenson]]\n| portrayer        = [[Joanne Kelly]]\n| nickname         = Mykes\n| gender           = Female\n| occupation       = [[United States Secret Service]]<br />Warehouse 13 agent\n| family           = Warren Bering (father)<br />Jeannie Bering (mother)<br />Tracy (sister)\n| spouse           = \n| nationality      = [[Americans|American]]\n| significant_other = [[List of Warehouse 13 characters#Sam Martino|Sam Martino]]<br />[[Pete Lattimer]]\n| relatives        = \n}}\nAgent '''Myka Ophelia Bering''' is a fictional character on the [[U.S. television science fiction]] series, ''[[Warehouse 13]]'' (2009\u20132014), portrayed by [[Joanne Kelly]]. In common with co-protagonist Agent [[Pete Lattimer]] (Eddie McClintock), Agent Bering is a [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]] agent. Both have been seconded to the titular Warehouse 13, where their work involves collecting artifacts, under conditions of highest classification secrecy. In opposition to her partner's happy-go-lucky attitude and reliance on intuition, Myka is smart, organized, and has a scrupulous eye for detail.\n\n==Character history==\nBering (born c.1982) is from [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], [[Colorado]], where her parents live. Early on in her life, Myka's parents open a bookstore called, \"Bering and Sons,\" even though she has no brothers; the 'and Sons' is only added to make the establishment sound classier.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Pilot|episodelink=Warehouse 13 (season 1)#ep1|series=Warehouse 13|network=[[Syfy]]|airdate=July 7, 2009|season=1|number=1|minutes=37:53}}</ref> She has one sister, Tracy, who Myka describes as \"the pretty one\" that all the boys were crazy about.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Age Before Beauty|episodelink=Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep16|series=Warehouse 13|network=[[Syfy]]|airdate=July 27, 2010|season=1|number=4|minutes=26:30}}</ref> Unlike her sister, Myka is a tomboy, and thus, instead of growing up playing with [[Barbies]], was a member of [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts]]. As a teen one of her hobbies is [[fencing]]. She also enjoys books and is an avid reader. Myka attended Lincoln High School in Colorado Springs, and graduated in 2000. She is a college graduate, and was [[Pre-medical|Pre-med]] and [[Pre-law]] at some point before being recruited into the Secret Service; at least one of these qualifications was obtained at the University of Colorado<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Magnetism|episodelink=Warehouse 13 (season 1)#ep3|series=Warehouse 13|network=[[Syfy]]|airdate=July 21, 2009|season=1|number=3|minutes=6:29}}</ref> She has at least two tattoos, one on her right ankle<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Duped|episodelink=Warehouse 13 (season 1)#ep8|series=Warehouse 13|network=[[Syfy]]|airdate=August 25, 2009|season=1|number=8|minutes=9:56}}</ref> and another on the inside.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Age Before Beauty|episodelink=Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep16|series=Warehouse 13|network=[[Syfy]]|airdate=July 27, 2010|season=2|number=4|minutes=11:57}}</ref>\n\nOrganized and focused, Myka believes in hard work, solid planning and steadfast execution. She never met a meticulously detailed mission outline she didn't like, and her attention to minutiae leads to her status as a rising star in the Secret Service despite a classified \"situation\" in Denver, Colorado. Reassigned to Washington, DC, Myka serves as an agent on presidential security detail.\n\nAn order dated May 11, 2009 is sent to Chief Supervisor [[List of Warehouse 13 characters#Daniel Dickinson|Daniel Dickinson]], Myka's boss, ordering her immediate transfer to an undisclosed location from her branch in presidential security. The transfer is classified as top secret and the authorization comes from a single name, \"Frederic.\"<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Pilot|episodelink=Warehouse 13 (season 1)#ep1|series=Warehouse 13|network=[[Syfy]]|airdate=July 7, 2009|season=1|number=1|minutes=23:06}}</ref> Following the instructions given to her, Myka finds herself in the [[Badlands Wilderness|badlands]] of [[South Dakota]] assigned as an agent to Warehouse 13 with a new boss, [[Arthur \"Artie\" Nielsen|Artie Nielsen]], and a new partner, Pete Lattimer. Her job is to gather and protect mysterious and powerful artifacts that threaten the world.\n\nThe new assignment is not the career path she envisioned, and thus she initially resists. However, over time she learns the importance of the job and grows to enjoy the work and the companionship of her fellow agents. In the season 2 episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep23|Buried]]\", Myka realizes the warehouse is her happiest place.\n\nBeginning with the season 2 episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep19|For the Team]]\", Myka builds a relationship with the previously de-bronzed [[Helena G. Wells]]. Helena eventually wins Myka over and gains an ally in her bid to be reinstated as a warehouse agent.  In the season 2 finale, \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep24|Reset]]\", Myka's trust is betrayed when Helena uses the Warehouse to acquire the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Trident]], the world's first weapon of mass destruction. Myka plays a pivotal role in her capture, but not before Wells nearly causes a planetary disaster.\n\nShaken by her lapse in judgment concerning H.G. Wells, and filled with doubt about her future effectiveness as warehouse agent, Myka resigns from her job \u2013 an obviously painful decision for her. At the start of season three, Myka is back in Colorado working at her father's bookstore.  After Pete comes to Myka for assistance solving a new case, she returns to the Warehouse and is reinstated to her former position.\n\n{{Expand section|date=June 2013}}\n\nIn season 4 episode [[What Matters Most]], Myka is diagnosed with [[ovarian cancer]] during the physical that all the agents must take part in.\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nMyka has received training from both civilian law enforcement and the Secret Service in firearms, personal protection, and investigation. Reluctant to rely solely gut instinct, she routinely advocates using formal deduction and investigative work; as such, her partners and coworkers note that her \"by the book\" mentality and professionalism has made her exceptional at closing cases, and why many of the people she interviews confess due to overwhelming evidence. As a warehouse agent, she has also displayed extensive formal knowledge, including specific knowledge in literature, history, science, and mathematics, making her the primary investigator in the field.\n\nMyka's biggest asset is her attention to detail; she is cited as having a photographic memory in the episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep15|Beyond Our Control]]\", being able to recall minute details from the Farnsworth schematics to repair a projector artifact. Myka is an expert martial artist, although the specific discipline she studied is never specified. She is also adept at sword fighting, saying \"some girls played with [[Barbie Doll|Barbies]], other girls took [[fencing]] lessons.\" In addition to English, she speaks French, Russian, Japanese and Latin, and reads at least some Arabic, Chinese and Portuguese.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=A New Hope|episodelink=Warehouse 13 (season 4)#ep1|series=Warehouse 13|network=[[Syfy]]|airdate=July 23, 2012|season=4|number=1|minutes=7:40}}</ref> In a deleted scene from the episode \"Vendetta\" she is heard telling Artie in the background that she speaks French, Italian, and Spanish.\n\nThe warehouse regents also infer that Myka's unique mix of training, deduction, and nearly flawless memory makes her uniquely qualified for working with artifacts, and a natural counterbalance to Agent Pete Lattimer. While Pete is more focused on people and the human dimension to artifact recovery, Myka focuses on results, facts, and fairness. As such, Myke is intensely dedicated to the mission, even at the cost of great personal sacrifice.\n\n==Relationships==\nAside from her past love affair with Sam Martino, there is little evidence of close personal relationships in Myka's past prior to her arrival at Warehouse 13.  As we see glimpses into her past, she is portrayed as a person who is somewhat cold and distant from those around her.  In the episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep16|Age Before Beauty]]\", we learn that Myka was the unpopular sibling, her sister being the well-liked one.  In \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep20|Merge with Caution]]\", when Myka arrives at her ten-year high school reunion, she is not well remembered.  While attending a reunion social gathering, we see Myka sitting alone at the bar drinking vodka tonics.  Aside from a brief encounter with Kurt Smoller, there is no interaction between her and her former classmates.  Myka even turns down an offer from Kurt to join the group of friends with whom he is sitting, hinting that her past association with Kurt's friends was unpleasant. In the episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep38|The Greatest Gift]]\" we see Myka in an alternate reality, brought about by Pete's interaction with an artifact, where she is a Secret Service agent still working in Washington, D.C.  Pete finds Myka sitting alone in a bar on Christmas Eve and tries to convince her that they're partners in another reality.  Pete tells her that ''his'' Myka is surrounded by people who love her, to which she responds, \"I have friends\", but it is clear Myka realizes that she really doesn't have any true friends.\n\nThroughout season one Myka gradually develops close relationships with her new Warehouse colleagues.  For the first time in her life, Myka builds bonds of friendship and love with those who surround her.  The coming together as a family of Myka, Pete, Artie, Claudia and Leena is a theme that runs throughout the second season.<ref>Jack Kenny, Season 2 DVD, Disc 2, Video Blog \"What's New For Season 2\"</ref>  In the season 3 episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep27|Trials]]\", Myka explains to the Regents her reason for returning to the Warehouse... \"The world has joy in it.  When you find a place that allows you to experience that joy.  When you find people that make you feel safe and loved, like you belong.  You don't walk away from it.  You fight for it.\"\n\n'''Jeannie Bering''' ([[Susan Hogan (actress)|Susan Hogan]]). Myka's mother, Jeannie, appears in the season 1 episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 1)#ep11|Nevermore]]\" and then again briefly in \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep38|The Greatest Gift]]\", though Myka and Jeannie do not interact in the latter episode.  While Myka's problems with her father are well known to audiences of season one, her relationship with Jeannie has gone largely undeveloped.  By all outward appearances, they have a normal mother-daughter relationship.\n\n'''Warren Bering''' ([[Michael Hogan (Canadian actor)|Michael Hogan]]).  Myka's father, Warren, was a very demanding parent, which resulted in a strained and troubled relationship between him and his daughter. In the season 1 episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 1)#ep11|Nevermore]]\", Myka receives word that Warren is dying and rushes to Colorado to see him. It is discovered that he is under the influence of a bifurcated artifact, and is saved when the two parts of the artifact are brought back together. The incident brings Myka and her father back together, allowing them to make amends and begin a renewed relationship.\n\n'''Tracy Bering''' ([[Amy Acker]]).  Myka's younger sister, Tracy, is mentioned in the episodes \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep16|Age Before Beauty]]\" and \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 4)#ep43|No Pain, No Gain]]\".  It is revealed that Myka harbors some jealousy towards her sister because, as Myka explains, \"She's the cheerleader, and the homecoming queen; you know, she was the one that all the boys were crazy about.\"  Pete comforts Myka by telling her that she's a stunningly beautiful woman and that it's her sister who should be jealous. Tracy is first seen in the season 4 episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 4)#ep47|The Ones You Love]]\" when Myka frees her from the influence of an artifact.\n\n'''Kurt Smoller''' ([[Cody Rhodes]]).  In the season 2 episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep20|Merge with Caution]]\", we see that Myka had a high school crush on the captain of the football team, Kurt, who she tutored in math. At their ten-year reunion, chemistry develops between them, though it is really Myka's body inhabited by Pete's mind, which is caused by a body-swapping artifact. After returning to her body, Myka goes to see Kurt and some of the previous day's chemistry still exists. They exchange a kiss and agree to stay in touch.\n\n'''[[List of Warehouse 13 characters#Sam Martino|Sam Martino]]''' ([[Gabriel Hogan]]).  As a Secret Service agent stationed in Denver, Colorado, Myka is partnered with Sam, with whom she builds a romantic relationship.  At the time, Sam is married but separated from his wife.  He is murdered while on assignment and, for some time, Myka feels partly responsible, believing she acted too slowly to save him.  She is stricken with guilt and grief over Sam's death until she acknowledges to herself that she had not been responsible and that Sam had been at fault for not following their plan to corner a criminal named Leo Bock.  In the season 3 episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep32|Past Imperfect]]\", Myka learns that a fellow agent conspired with Leo to murder Sam, aided by an artifact that could temporarily freeze time.  Both Leo and his accomplice are killed, thus finally bringing closure for Myka.\n\n'''Zach Adanto''' (J. August Richard) and '''Jim''' ([[Yancey Arias]]).  Former colleagues at the Denver Secret Service, Zach and Jim worked with Myka on the Leo Bock case.  In \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep32|Past Imperfect]]\", Myka again enlists their help when she spots Leo in Denver while working on an unrelated case.  Although they work together as professionals, it is portrayed that they are not necessarily friendly.  Zach and Jim describe Myka as, \"Still impulsive and emotional\"... \"Classic Myka.\"  It is discovered that Jim was Leo's accomplice in Sam's murder, and in separate shooting incidents, Zach takes the lives of both.\n\n'''[[List of Warehouse 13 characters#Daniel Dickinson|Daniel Dickinson]]''' (Simon Reynolds).  Dickinson is Myka's supervisor at the Washington, D.C. Secret Service.  He considers Myka to be one of his best agents and a rising star, stating that \"she's going places.\"  They maintain a good relationship even after Myka's departure, at least until Artie forces them to sever contact because of the demands of Warehouse security.  Myka is very saddened by Dickinson's death in the season 2 episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep21|Vendetta]]\".\n\n'''[[Pete Lattimer]]''' ([[Eddie McClintock]]).  As co-protagonists, Pete and Myka spend more time on screen together than any other characters.  They initially clash with one another in the \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 1)#ep1|Pilot]]\" episode as they work together on a case in Washington, D.C., but after both are recruited by Mrs. Frederic to work at Warehouse 13, they try to get along.  Myka is at first annoyed by Pete's childlike nature and off-the-cuff style, which clashes with her by-the-book approach; however, after season one, she begins to find Pete's manner less annoying and more endearing.  Over time they draw close and come to discover that their differences make them stronger when paired together.  By the end of season 2, Pete and Myka have become the best of friends.  Pete displays an innate ability to bring out of Myka a happy fun-loving side, rather than always being the uptight and isolated person she was when they first met.<ref name=\"cjanders\">{{Cite web|url=http://io9.com/5864702/warehouse-13s-joanne-kelly-i-would-love-to-see-hg-wells-and-myka-get-together|title=Warehouse 13's Joanne Kelly: \"I would love\" to see H.G. Wells and Myka get together|author=Charlie Jane Anders|publisher=i09.com}}</ref>  In the Season 2 finale \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep24|Reset]]\", upon leaving the Warehouse, Myka writes in her resignation letter that Pete is the big brother she never had. But the way Pete reacts, running out of the Warehouse in a futile attempt to catch her, almost in tears, suggests that he thinks of her as more than a sister.  When she returns in season 3, Myka describes Pete to the Regents as \"an extraordinary partner.\"  In the season 3 episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep28|Love Sick]]\", after waking up naked in bed together with no memory of what happen, both declare, \"I don't think of you that way.\"  Pete reassures Myka that she's his partner and best friend and nothing, not even having sex and forgetting about it, will change that.  They later learn, to Myka's relief, that nothing happened between them. Nevertheless, their relationship continues to evolve in season 4 and 5. By the end of season 5, in the episode \"Endless\" they decide to explore their developing feelings for each other.\n\n'''[[List of Warehouse 13 characters#Mrs. Irene Frederic|Mrs. Frederic]]''' ([[C. C. H. Pounder]]).  Myka's first meeting with Mrs. Frederic takes place off screen, when Myka is recruited to join the Warehouse in the \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 1)#ep1|Pilot]]\" episode.  Mrs. Frederic is a character that doesn't allow close personal friendships to develop between her and the agents that work for her.  Nonetheless, she and Myka are as close to friends as they can be, and there is a strong bond of loyalty and respect between them.  In the episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep26|The New Guy]]\", Mrs. Frederic gets Myka to return to the Warehouse by bringing H. G. Wells to her, where Helena tells Myka, \"Don't walk away from your truth.\"\n\n'''[[Arthur \"Artie\" Nielsen|Artie Nielsen]]''' ([[Saul Rubinek]]).  During much of the first season Myka and Artie have a strained relationship, which is explored in the episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 1)#ep8|Duped]]\".  She believes Artie's secrecy and withholding of information puts her at risk whenever she goes out into the field. In spite of everything, she likes Artie and thinks he's great.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Implosion|episodelink=Warehouse 13 (season 1)#ep7|series=Warehouse 13|network=[[Syfy]]|airdate=August 18, 2009|season=1|number=7|minutes=40:47}}</ref>  After explaining her feelings to him, the relationship improves.  They clash again in season 2 episodes \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep21|Vendetta]]\" and \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep22|Where and When]]\" after Myka advocates for the reinstatement of H. G. Wells, a decision Artie adamantly opposes.  The incident causes friction between them, but the relationship soon returns to normal.  Despite their disagreements, Myka and Artie develop a deep affection for each other, which is frequently on display:  In \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep13|Time Will Tell]]\", Myka reacts with elation upon seeing Artie rise from the ashes of the exploded umbilicus and, in \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep16|Age Before Beauty]]\", Artie is deeply troubled when Myka falls victim to a rapid aging artifact.  We also witness Artie's emotion in \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep26|The New Guy]]\" upon seeing that Myka has returned to the Warehouse, simply uttering \"Good\" with a satisfying smile on his face.\n\n'''(ferret) Pete'''.  Created by an artifact in the \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 1)#ep1|Pilot]]\" episode, Myka adopts a pet ferret, for which she has a soft spot.  It is revealed in the episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 1)#ep8|Duped]]\" that she named the ferret Pete, after her partner, because \"they're both cute but annoying.\"  Ferret Pete has not been seen since the pilot, but is occasionally mentioned.\n\n'''[[Leena (Warehouse 13)|Leena]]''' ([[Genelle Williams]]).  Although Leena is the least developed of the main characters, it is clear she shares a strong bond of affection with the others, and is often seen in a maternal role.  Interaction between her and Myka is always portrayed as friendly and caring.  While in the field, Myka and Pete frequently turn to Leena as a reliable source of information and research.  When off duty at the B&B, Leena is a regular member of the social group. When Leena is killed Myka is one of the most heavily effected other than Artie.\n\n'''[[Claudia Donovan]]''' ([[Allison Scagliotti]]).  Myka has developed a big sister relationship with Claudia, which really began to mature in season 2.  Myka is an important mentor to Claudia on her first field assignment in the season 2 episode \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep19|For The Team]]\" and tricks her into believing in herself.  Recognizing Claudia's potential, Myka has been very encouraging to her.  Her belief in Claudia is reinforced when Myka writes in her season 2 resignation letter, \"I wish I could be there to see you grow into the amazing woman you're going to become.\"  Myka, as well as the entire Warehouse, often relies on Claudia's inventive ingenuity to devise gadgets to help get out of various predicaments.\n\n'''[[Helena G. Wells]]''' ([[Jaime Murray]]).  Myka's relationship with Helena (aka, H.G.) is likely the most complex of the series.  Initially warned off by Artie from having any interaction with her, Myka begins to build a friendship with Helena in season 2, keeping their interactions a secret from the rest of the Warehouse team.  As seen in the episodes \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep19|For The Team]]\" and \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep21|Vendetta]]\", the two women quickly develop a respect, admiration, and understanding of each other.  Myka is angered and hurt when Helena betrays the Warehouse at the end of season 2, but when she shows remorse for what she has done, Myka again befriends her in season 3. Actress Joanne Kelly has stated that Myka and Helena \"fell in love a little bit.\"<ref>[https://archive.is/20130101190433/http://www.afterellen.com/TV/warehouse-13-star-confirms-the-shows-lesbian-subtext-and-then-some AfterEllen.com, July 25, 2011, retrieved September 8, 2012]</ref>  Their developing mutual love and affection<ref name=\"cjanders\"/> culminates in Helena's self-sacrifice to save Myka, Pete and Artie from an explosion in the season 3 finale, \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep37|Stand]]\".  Myka is visibly heartbroken over the death of Helena.  Helena's sacrifice and death are wiped from existence in the season 4 premiere, \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 4)#ep39|A New Hope]]\", when Artie uses a failsafe artifact to prevent the explosion and reverse the Warehouse's destruction.\n\n'''[[List of Warehouse 13 characters#Steve Jinks|Steve Jinks]]''' ([[Aaron Ashmore]]).  There is little on screen interaction between Myka and Steve, as Steve is mainly seen as a partner to Claudia.  It is portrayed, however, that they share a friendship and good working relationship, with Steve becoming a member of the Warehouse family.  Myka is grief-stricken over Steve's murder in the season 3 episodes \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep36|Emily Lake]]\" and \"[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep37|Stand]]\". She is also the first to figure out his connection to Claudia and the artifact in Season 4 indicating she pays more attention to him than the others do (except Claudia).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Warehouse 13}}\n*{{Official website|http://www.syfy.com/warehouse13}}\n\n{{Warehouse 13}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bering, Myka}}\n[[Category:Warehouse 13 characters]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2009]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Colorado]]\n[[Category:Fictional Secret Service personnel]]\n", "name_user": "192.182.191.222", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myka_Bering"}

In 1996, she released ''[[Sisters of Avalon]]'', and an original album of Christmas songs, ''[[Merry Christmas...Have a Nice Life]]'' in 1998.<ref name=allmusic/> These two albums were much less successful internationally than her previous releases, but both charted in Japan. ''Sisters of Avalon'' was also certified platinum in Japan.\n\nIn 2001, Lauper planned to release another album, ''[[Shine (Cyndi Lauper album)|Shine]]'', but the record company folded. An [[extended play]] version of the album was released to counter Internet [[Copyright infringement|piracy]], and the full album was released exclusively in Japan in 2004. In 2003, Lauper released her seventh studio album, ''[[At Last (Cyndi Lauper album)|At Last]]'', and a live version in 2004 on [[DVD]], ''Live... At Last''.<ref name=allmusic/> ''At Last'' is a set of covers that reinvent classic songs, such as the title track \"[[At Last]]\", \"[[Walk On By (song)|Walk On By]]\" and \"[[Stay (Maurice Williams song)|Stay]]\". The live DVD achieved gold certification in the United States. In 2005, Lauper released ''[[The Body Acoustic]]'', featuring new acoustic versions of her hits, such as a duet of \"[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]\" with [[Sarah McLachlan]]. Lauper's 2008 album, ''[[Bring Ya to the Brink]]'', was her first release in seven years containing original material, and met with considerable success. In December 2008 she recorded the duet \"[[A Christmas Duel]]\" with Swedish pop band [[The Hives]], released in Sweden only, where it reached number 4.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sverigetopplistan.se |title=Svenska Topplistan |language=Swedish}}</ref>  ''[[Memphis Blues (album)|Memphis Blues]]'', was released in 2010. It managed to be her highest-charting album on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] since ''True Colors'' in 1986, spending 13 consecutive weeks at number-one on the ''Billboard'' Blues chart, becoming the highest selling blues album of the year. So far, it has sold 600,000 copies worldwide.  Her most recent album is ''[[Detour (Cyndi Lauper album)|Detour]]'', released in 2016.  It is a country and western album inspired by some of her favourite artists growing up including [[Patsy Cline]]. The album peaked at number 29 on U.S. Billboard Top 200 Albums Chart.\n\n==Albums==\n===Studio albums===\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Year\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:19em;\"|Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:17em;\"|Album details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"10\"|Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"|[[Music recording sales certification|Certifications]]\n|- \n!width=35|<small>[[Billboard 200|US]]</small><br /><ref name=\"uscharts\">{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/cyndi-lauper/chart-history/TLP |title=Cyndi Lauper Chart History |accessdate=2020-01-10 |work=Billboard}}</ref>\n!width=35|<small>[[ARIA Charts|AUS]]</small><br /><ref name=\"auscharts\">Australian chart peaks:\n*Top 100 ([[Kent Music Report]]) peaks to 19 June 1988: {{cite book|last=Kent|first=David|authorlink=David Kent (historian)|title=Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992|edition=Illustrated|publisher=Australian Chart Book|location=St Ives, N.S.W.|page=173|year=1993|isbn=0-646-11917-6}} N.B.

The album was a major success, achieving platinum and gold certification around the world and spawning the hits \"[[Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]\", \"[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]\" and \"[[She Bop]]\". In 1985, Lauper released \"[[The Goonies 'R' Good Enough]]\", a single from the soundtrack to ''[[The Goonies]]'', and her second album, ''[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper album)|True Colors]]'', was released in 1986. ''True Colors'' was another successful album, along with the [[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|single of the same name]] and \"[[Change of Heart (Cyndi Lauper song)|Change of Heart]]\".<ref name=allmusic/> A starring role in the film ''[[Vibes (film)|Vibes]]'' in 1988 led to the release of \"[[Hole in My Heart (All the Way to China)]]\", which was a hit in Australia and New Zealand. Lauper's third album, ''[[A Night to Remember (Cyndi Lauper album)|A Night to Remember]]'', was released in 1989. This album was less successful, despite the popularity of the first single, \"[[I Drove All Night]]\".<ref name=allmusic/> The following single, \"[[My First Night Without You]]\"<ref name=allmusic/> managed to chart in the top 60 in the United States.\n\nIn 1992, Lauper appeared in the English version of ''[[Starmania (musical)|Starmania]]'', a French [[rock opera]]. She released a single from the musical, \"[[The World Is Stone]]\", which was a major hit in several countries, particularly France. Her album ''[[Hat Full of Stars]]'' was released in 1993 on [[Epic Records]], attaining gold certification in France and Japan. Lauper's greatest hits compilation, ''[[Twelve Deadly Cyns...and Then Some]]'', was released in 1994, with the re-recorded version of \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" reaching number four in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. A compilation of Lauper's music videos and an interview was released at the same time on [[VHS]]. In 1996, she released ''[[Sisters of Avalon]]'', and an original album of Christmas songs, ''[[Merry Christmas...Have a Nice Life]]'' in 1998.<ref name=allmusic/> These two albums were much less successful internationally than her previous releases, but both charted in Japan. ''Sisters of Avalon'' was also certified platinum in Japan.\n\nIn 2001, Lauper planned to release another album, ''[[Shine (Cyndi Lauper album)|Shine]]'', but the record company folded. An [[extended play]] version of the album was released to counter Internet [[Copyright infringement|piracy]], and the full album was released exclusively in Japan in 2004. In 2003, Lauper released her seventh studio album, ''[[At Last (Cyndi Lauper album)|At Last]]'', and a live version in 2004 on [[DVD]], ''Live... At Last''.<ref name=allmusic/> ''At Last'' is a set of covers that reinvent classic songs, such as the title track \"[[At Last]]\", \"[[Walk On By (song)|Walk On By]]\" and \"[[Stay (Maurice Williams song)|Stay]]\". The live DVD achieved gold certification in the United States. In 2005, Lauper released ''[[The Body Acoustic]]'', featuring new acoustic versions of her hits, such as a duet of \"[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]\" with [[Sarah McLachlan]]. Lauper's 2008 album, ''[[Bring Ya to the Brink]]'', was her first release in seven years containing original material, and met with considerable success. In December 2008 she recorded the duet \"[[A Christmas Duel]]\" with Swedish pop band [[The Hives]], released in Sweden only, where it reached number 4.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sverigetopplistan.se |title=Svenska Topplistan |language=Swedish}}</ref>  ''[[Memphis Blues (album)|Memphis Blues]]'', was released in 2010. It managed to be her highest-charting album on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] since ''True Colors'' in 1986, spending 13 consecutive weeks at number-one on the ''Billboard'' Blues chart, becoming the highest selling blues album of the year. So far, it has sold 600,000 copies worldwide.  Her most recent album is ''[[Detour (Cyndi Lauper album)|Detour]]'', released in 2016.  It is a country and western album inspired by some of her favourite artists growing up including [[Patsy Cline]].

He released one album, ''The Call'', as a trio leader for the [[ESP-Disk]] record label in 1965.

It was commonly assumed Grimes had died; he was listed as such in several jazz reference works. Then Marshall Marrotte, a [[social work]]er and jazz fan, set out to discover Grimes's fate once and for all. In 2002, he found Grimes alive but nearly destitute, without a bass to play, renting a tiny apartment in [[Los Angeles, California]], writing poetry and doing odd jobs to support himself. He had fallen out of touch with the jazz world and was unaware [[Albert Ayler]] had died in 1970, but was eager to perform again.<ref>Strauss, Neil (May 26, 2003), [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04EFD81231F935A15756C0A9659C8B63 \"Silent 30 Years, A Jazzman Resurfaces; Left New York in '68, Plays Again Tonight\"], ''The New York Times''.

A [[documentary film]] is planned, and a biography, ''Music to Silence to Music'', was published by Northway Books in London in 2015.\n\nHenry Grimes made up for lost time: in 2003 he performed at more than two dozen music festivals or other appearances. He received a returning hero's welcome at the free jazz-oriented [[Vision Festival]], and began teaching lessons and workshops for bassists.

In 2004 he recorded as leader with [[David Murray (saxophonist)|David Murray]] and [[Hamid Drake]]; and in 2005 with guitarist [[Marc Ribot]], who also wrote an introduction to Grimes' first book, ''Signs Along the Road'', published in March 2007 by [[Buddy\u00b4s knife jazzedition|buddy's knife jazzedition]] in [[Cologne]], [[Germany]], a collection of Grimes' [[poetry]] in which he presents his selection of entries from thousands of pages of his writings during the long years he was not playing music. Also in 2007, Grimes recorded with drummer [[Rashied Ali]], with whom he played a half-dozen duo concerts and a trio with Marilyn Crispell, and in 2008 with [[Paul Dunmall]] and [[Andrew Cyrille]], a co-leader trio called the Profound Sound Trio, among others. Since his return in 2003, Grimes played at many venues around New York and on tour in the United States, Canada, and 30 countries in Europe, the Far East, and Brazil; often working as a leader, Grimes had been making music with [[Rashied Ali]], [[Marshall Allen]], [[Fred Anderson (musician)|Fred Anderson]], [[Marilyn Crispell]], [[Ted Curson]], [[Andrew Cyrille]], [[Bill Dixon]], [[Dave Douglas (trumpeter)|Dave Douglas]], [[Andrew Lamb (musician)|Andrew Lamb]], [[Joe Lovano]], [[Roscoe Mitchell]], [[William Parker (musician)|William Parker]], [[High Priest]] (from Anti-Pop Consortium), [[Roscoe Mitchell]], [[Wadada Leo Smith]], [[Cecil Taylor]] (with whom Grimes resumed playing in October, 2006 after 40 years), [[John Tchicai]], and many others. In 2011, the [[Chelsea Art Museum]] hosted a re-creation of the performance ''Black Zero'', a happening created in the 1960s by pioneering media artist [[Aldo Tambellini]]. Tambellini performed the multi-media piece on several occasions between 1965 and 1968, often in collaboration with jazz musicians such as Bill Dixon and [[Cecil McBee]]. The performance at the Chelsea Art Museum was produced by Swiss conceptual artist [[Christoph Draeger]], who invited Grimes to join. Grimes played with [[Ben Morea]], accompanying simultaneous slide and film projections by Aldo Tambellini and sound recordings of the late [[Calvin Hernton]]'s radical poetry.<ref>[http://stewarthomesociety.org/blog/archives/4033 \"Back In The New York Groove!\"]. Retrieved December 10, 2011.</ref>  In all, between Henry Grimes's return to the music world in 2003 and his 80th year, 2016, he played more than 640 concerts, including many festivals, in 30 countries.\n\nIn his last years, Grimes also held a number of residencies and offered workshops and master classes on major campuses, including [[City College of New York]], [[Berklee College of Music]], [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]], [[New England Conservatory]], the University of Illinois, the [[University of Michigan at Ann Arbor]], the [[University of Gloucestershire]] at [[Cheltenham]], [[Humber College]], and more. He released or played on a dozen new recordings, made his professional debut on a second instrument (the violin) at Cecil Taylor's side at Lincoln Center at the age of 70, and had been creating illustrations to accompany his new recordings and publications. Grimes received many honors in recent years, including four Meet the Composer grants.

He was 22 years old, and as word spread among the musicians about his extraordinary playing, he ended up playing with six different groups in the festival that weekend: those of [[Benny Goodman]], [[Lee Konitz]], [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Gerry Mulligan]], [[Sonny Rollins]], and [[Tony Scott]].<ref name=Inquirer /> And though Henry\u2019s name never even appeared in the festival\u2019s printed program, ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic [[Bosley Crowther]] took note of the remarkable young bassist and listed him as one of the festival\u2019s primary players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://henrygrimes.com/biography/|title=Henry Grimes Biographies|work=Henry Grimes|access-date=January 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\nGradually growing interested in the burgeoning [[free jazz]] movement, Grimes performed with most of the music's important names, including pianist [[Cecil Taylor]], trumpeter [[Don Cherry (jazz)|Don Cherry]], saxophonists [[Steve Lacy (saxophonist)|Steve Lacy]], [[Pharoah Sanders]], [[Archie Shepp]], and [[Albert Ayler]]. He released one album, ''The Call'', as a trio leader for the [[ESP-Disk]] record label in 1965.

It was commonly assumed Grimes had died; he was listed as such in several jazz reference works. Then Marshall Marrotte, a [[social work]]er and jazz fan, set out to discover Grimes's fate once and for all. In 2002, he found Grimes alive but nearly destitute, without a bass to play, renting a tiny apartment in [[Los Angeles, California]], writing poetry and doing odd jobs to support himself. He had fallen out of touch with the jazz world and was unaware [[Albert Ayler]] had died in 1970, but was eager to perform again.<ref>Strauss, Neil (May 26, 2003), [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04EFD81231F935A15756C0A9659C8B63 \"Silent 30 Years, A Jazzman Resurfaces; Left New York in '68, Plays Again Tonight\"], ''The New York Times''.

A [[documentary film]] is planned, and a biography, ''Music to Silence to Music'', was published by Northway Books in London in 2015.\n\nHenry Grimes made up for lost time: in 2003 he performed at more than two dozen music festivals or other appearances. He received a returning hero's welcome at the free jazz-oriented [[Vision Festival]], and began teaching lessons and workshops for bassists.

In 2004 he recorded as leader with [[David Murray (saxophonist)|David Murray]] and [[Hamid Drake]]; and in 2005 with guitarist [[Marc Ribot]], who also wrote an introduction to Grimes' first book, ''Signs Along the Road'', published in March 2007 by [[Buddy\u00b4s knife jazzedition|buddy's knife jazzedition]] in [[Cologne]], [[Germany]], a collection of Grimes' [[poetry]] in which he presents his selection of entries from thousands of pages of his writings during the long years he was not playing music. Also in 2007, Grimes recorded with drummer [[Rashied Ali]], with whom he played a half-dozen duo concerts and a trio with Marilyn Crispell, and in 2008 with [[Paul Dunmall]] and [[Andrew Cyrille]], a co-leader trio called the Profound Sound Trio, among others. Since his return in 2003, Grimes played at many venues around New York and on tour in the United States, Canada, and 30 countries in Europe, the Far East, and Brazil; often working as a leader, Grimes had been making music with [[Rashied Ali]], [[Marshall Allen]], [[Fred Anderson (musician)|Fred Anderson]], [[Marilyn Crispell]], [[Ted Curson]], [[Andrew Cyrille]], [[Bill Dixon]], [[Dave Douglas (trumpeter)|Dave Douglas]], [[Andrew Lamb (musician)|Andrew Lamb]], [[Joe Lovano]], [[Roscoe Mitchell]], [[William Parker (musician)|William Parker]], [[High Priest]] (from Anti-Pop Consortium), [[Roscoe Mitchell]], [[Wadada Leo Smith]], [[Cecil Taylor]] (with whom Grimes resumed playing in October, 2006 after 40 years), [[John Tchicai]], and many others. In 2011, the [[Chelsea Art Museum]] hosted a re-creation of the performance ''Black Zero'', a happening created in the 1960s by pioneering media artist [[Aldo Tambellini]]. Tambellini performed the multi-media piece on several occasions between 1965 and 1968, often in collaboration with jazz musicians such as Bill Dixon and [[Cecil McBee]]. The performance at the Chelsea Art Museum was produced by Swiss conceptual artist [[Christoph Draeger]], who invited Grimes to join. Grimes played with [[Ben Morea]], accompanying simultaneous slide and film projections by Aldo Tambellini and sound recordings of the late [[Calvin Hernton]]'s radical poetry.<ref>[http://stewarthomesociety.org/blog/archives/4033 \"Back In The New York Groove!\"].

He released or played on a dozen new recordings, made his professional debut on a second instrument (the violin) at Cecil Taylor's side at Lincoln Center at the age of 70, and had been creating illustrations to accompany his new recordings and publications.
