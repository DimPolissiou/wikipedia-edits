Completed in the 1710s, it was a part of the collections formed by Parisian merchant and art collector [[Pierre Crozat]], and later by his relatives. Since being acquired for [[Catherine II of Russia]] in 1772, the painting was held among the Russian imperial family collections in the Hermitage and, after the 1850s, in the [[Gatchina Palace]]; in 1920, it was transitioned in the Winter Palace, where it currently remains as part of the Hermitage Museum permanent exhibition. Throughout its provenance, the work has also been known under a number of various titles, with ''Coquettes...'' becoming dominant since the later 19th century; in Russian literature, a title of '''''Actors of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise'''''{{efn|{{lang-ru|\u00ab\u0410\u043a\u0442\u0451\u0440\u044b \u0444\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0437\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u00bb}}}} has been adopted since the later 20th century, following studies of Watteau's drawings that established a possible identity.\n\nThe painting is a group portrait which is considered to be the rarest kind in Watteau's body of work; it depicts five figures in half-length \u2014 two men, two women and a [[Black people|black]] boy \u2014 set amidst a dark background. Among various explanations of the subject, one is accepted in Russia that identifies the adults as members of the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]] who performed in [[Florent Carton Dancourt]]'s play ''[[The Three Cousins]]'', and the black boy as Pierre Crozat's servant; other scholars presumed it to be a depiction of [[commedia dell'arte masks]] or of a family group preparing for a ball.\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\n{{quote box|align=left|width=25%|quote=\"\u2026Watteau combines portraiture with a striking feeling for the picturesque. The rounded, resilient brushstrokes seem to have benn applied with the lightness of spontaneous improvisation, yet at the same time with a bold precision which only a mature master could command. The faces, showing fatigue, animation and faint anxiety, are illuminated by a mysterious theatrical light, the fantastic costumes shimmer with wine-pink tones against the black velvet of the masks. All this creates an impression of the natural unity of the imagined and the actual, a [[E. T. A. Hoffmann|Hoffmannesque]] world where the characters\u2019 reality in only enhanced by the strangeness of their surroundings.\"|source=\u2014[[Mikhail German]] on ''Actors...'', in a 1980 artbook ''Antoine Watteau''.{{sfn|German|1980|p=8}}}}\n''Actors ...'' is an oil on panel painting upholstered in wood, and measures approximately 20 \u00d7 25&nbsp;cm.{{sfnm|Nemilova|1964|1p=181|2a1=Grasselli|2a2=Rosenberg|2a3=Parmantier|1984|2p=311}}\n\nIn the painting, Watteau depicts five figures in half-length, standing around a stone balustrade. To the right, an outwardly old man stands upon a stick and holds a mushroom hat, dressed in a skullcap. By the balustrade's other side, a young girl is shown in a light-colored striped dress with high standing collar, standing behind a black boy in green-striped clothes. Over the girl's shoulder, a man's head appears in a large motley beret. To the left side, a young woman turned to the right in profile, appears in a Polish-styled red dress and white chipper, leaning on the balustrade and holding a black mask in the right hand.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}}\n\nDefects found on the panel include a restored crack to the right of the old man's cape; gaps in shadows, more importantly at the bottom edge and around the girl's head; chippings painted over the girl's left shoulder.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}} An X-ray analysis published by Soviet scholars in 1973 revealed changes in the composition showing that in the early stages the woman at the left was bareheaded, wore a different costume, and had placed her mask on the balustrade. The several differences between the painting and the engraving, notably in the coiffure of the central female figure, are considered relating to the state of the painting, which has been somewhat damaged and restored in the past.{{sfnm|Zolotov|1973|1p=138|Nemilova|1982|2pp=130\u2013131|3a1=Grasselli|3a2=Rosenberg|3a3=Parmantier|3y=1984|3p=312}}\n\n<!--[[Donald Posner]] described ''Actors'' less successful in its idea and composition, while having beautiful painting of individual forms.{{sfn|Posner|1984|p=290}}-->\n\n===Identity of subjects===\n[[File:Henri Simon Thomassin - Coquettes qui pour voir galans au rendez-vous.jpg|thumb|The painting's traditional naming originates from {{Interlanguage link|Henri Simon Thomassin|lt=Henri Simon Thomassin's|fr}} engraving, executed for the ''Recueil Jullienne''.]]\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, sources and studies on Watteau variously defined the work's subject.

Completed in the 1710s, it was a part of the collections formed by Parisian merchant and art collector [[Pierre Crozat]], and later by his relatives. Since being acquired for [[Catherine II of Russia]] in 1772, the painting was held among the Russian imperial family collections in the Hermitage and, after the 1850s, in the [[Gatchina Palace]]; in 1920, it was transitioned in the Winter Palace, where it currently remains as part of the Hermitage Museum permanent exhibition. Throughout its provenance, the work has also been known under a number of various titles, with ''Coquettes...'' becoming dominant since the later 19th century; in Russian literature, a title of '''''Actors of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise'''''{{efn|{{lang-ru|\u00ab\u0410\u043a\u0442\u0451\u0440\u044b \u0444\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0437\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u00bb}}}} has been adopted since the later 20th century, following studies of Watteau's drawings that established a possible identity.\n\nThe painting is a group portrait which is considered to be the rarest kind in Watteau's body of work; it depicts five figures in half-length \u2014 two men, two women and a [[Black people|black]] boy \u2014 set amidst a dark background. Among various explanations of the subject, one is accepted in Russia that identifies the adults as members of the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]] who performed in [[Florent Carton Dancourt]]'s play ''[[The Three Cousins]]'', and the black boy as Pierre Crozat's servant; other scholars presumed it to be a depiction of [[commedia dell'arte masks]] or of a family group preparing for a ball.\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\n{{quote box|align=left|width=25%|quote=\"\u2026Watteau combines portraiture with a striking feeling for the picturesque. The rounded, resilient brushstrokes seem to have benn applied with the lightness of spontaneous improvisation, yet at the same time with a bold precision which only a mature master could command. The faces, showing fatigue, animation and faint anxiety, are illuminated by a mysterious theatrical light, the fantastic costumes shimmer with wine-pink tones against the black velvet of the masks. All this creates an impression of the natural unity of the imagined and the actual, a [[E. T. A. Hoffmann|Hoffmannesque]] world where the characters\u2019 reality in only enhanced by the strangeness of their surroundings.\"|source=\u2014[[Mikhail German]] on ''Actors...'', in a 1980 artbook ''Antoine Watteau''.{{sfn|German|1980|p=8}}}}\n''Actors ...'' is an oil on panel painting upholstered in wood, and measures approximately 20 \u00d7 25&nbsp;cm.{{sfnm|Nemilova|1964|1p=181|2a1=Grasselli|2a2=Rosenberg|2a3=Parmantier|1984|2p=311}}\n\nIn the painting, Watteau depicts five figures in half-length, standing around a stone balustrade. To the right, an outwardly old man stands upon a stick and holds a mushroom hat, dressed in a skullcap. By the balustrade's other side, a young girl is shown in a light-colored striped dress with high standing collar, standing behind a black boy in green-striped clothes.

The characters fight each others until they defeat their opponents or the time expires. The matches typically consist of several rounds, in an arena, with each [[player character]] having different abilities but each is relatively [[Balance (game design)|viable to choose]]. Players must master techniques such as blocking, counter-attacking, and chaining attacks together into \"[[Combo (gaming)|combos]]\". Starting in the early 1990s, most fighting games allowed the player to execute [[#Special attacks|special attacks]] by performing specific input combinations. The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from [[beat 'em up]]s, which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player.\n\nThe first game to feature fist fighting was ''[[Heavyweight Champ]]'' in 1976, but it was ''[[Karate Champ]]'' which popularized one-on-one martial arts games in [[Amusement arcade|arcades]] in 1984. The following year, ''[[Yie Ar Kung-Fu]]'' featured antagonists with differing fighting styles, while ''[[The Way of the Exploding Fist]]'' further popularized the genre on home systems. In 1987, ''[[Street Fighter]]'' introduced hidden special attacks. In 1991, [[Capcom]]'s highly successful ''[[Street Fighter II]]'' refined and popularized many of the conventions of the genre. The fighting game subsequently became the preeminent genre for competitive video gaming in the early to mid-1990s, particularly in [[Video arcade|arcades]]. This period spawned dozens of other popular fighting games, including [[Media franchise|franchises]] like ''[[Street Fighter]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'', ''[[Tekken]]'', and ''[[Virtua Fighter]]''.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n==Definition==\nFighting games are a type of [[action game]] where two (or sometimes more) on-screen characters fight each other.<ref name=NGen15>{{cite magazine |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z: Fighting Game|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=33}}</ref><ref name=\"fundamentals\">{{cite book|last=Rollings|first=Andrew|authorlink=|author2=Ernest Adams|title=Fundamentals of Game Design|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2006|location=|url=http://wps.prenhall.com/bp_gamedev_1/54/14053/3597646.cw/index.html|access-date=February 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231072651/http://wps.prenhall.com/bp_gamedev_1/54/14053/3597646.cw/index.html|archive-date=December 31, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"ashcraft90\">{{cite book | author = Ashcraft, Brian | year = 2008 | title = Arcade Mania!

Most fighting games give the player the ability to execute a grapple move by pressing 2 or more buttons together or simply by pressing punch or kick while being extremely close the opponent. Other fighting games like ''Dead Or Alive'' have a unique button for throws and takedowns.\n\n====Projectiles====\nUsed primarily in 2D fighting games, projectiles are objects that a fighter can launch at another fighter to attack from a distance. While they can be used to simply inflict damage, projectiles are most often used to maneuver opponents into disadvantageous positions. The most notable projectile is Ryu and Ken's Hadoken from ''Street Fighter''.\n\n====Rushdown====\n{{see|Rush (video games)}}\nThe opposite of turtling, Rushdown refers to a number of specific, aggressive strategies, philosophies and play styles across all fighting games. The general goal of a rushdown player is to overwhelm the opponent and force costly mistakes either by using fast, confusing setups or by taking advantage of an impatient opponent as they are forced to play defense for prolonged periods of time. Rushdown players often favor attacking opponents in the corner or as they get up from a knockdown; both situations severely limit the options of the opponent and often allow the attacking player to force high-risk guessing scenarios.  \n\n====Spacing / Zoning====\nZoning is whatever series of tactics a player uses to keep their opponent at a specific distance. What exactly that distance is depends on both who the \"zoner\" and the opponent are using; differing based on the tools at their disposal versus the tools that the opposing player has.\n\n====Turtling====\n{{see|Turtling (gameplay)}}\nTurtling refers to fighting game tactic of playing very defensively and waiting for the opponent to make a move. It's somewhat of an extreme form of \"defensive play\".\n\n====Special attacks====\n\nAn integral feature of fighting games includes the use of \"special [[Strike (attack)|attacks]]\", also called \"secret moves\",<ref name=\"essential50\" /> that employ complex combinations of button presses to perform a particular move beyond basic punching and kicking.<ref>{{cite web | author = Towell, Justin | url = http://www.gamesradar.com/the-best-special-attacks-ever/ | title = The Best Special Attacks Ever | publisher = GamesRadar | accessdate = January 29, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120126204346/http://www.gamesradar.com/the-best-special-attacks-ever/ | archive-date = January 26, 2012 | url-status = live }}</ref> Combos, in which several attacks are chained together using basic punches and kicks, are another common feature in fighting games and have been fundamental to the genre since the release of ''Street Fighter II''.<ref name=\"Edge Street Fighter II\">{{cite journal |year=2003 |title=The making of ''Street Fighter II'' |journal=Edge Presents Retro |issue='The Making of...'

The characters fight each others until they defeat their opponents or the time expires. The matches typically consist of several rounds, in an arena, with each [[player character]] having different abilities but each is relatively [[Balance (game design)|viable to choose]]. Players must master techniques such as blocking, counter-attacking, and chaining attacks together into \"[[Combo (gaming)|combos]]\". Starting in the early 1990s, most fighting games allowed the player to execute [[#Special attacks|special attacks]] by performing specific input combinations. The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from [[beat 'em up]]s, which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player.\n\nThe first game to feature fist fighting was ''[[Heavyweight Champ]]'' in 1976, but it was ''[[Karate Champ]]'' which popularized one-on-one martial arts games in [[Amusement arcade|arcades]] in 1984. The following year, ''[[Yie Ar Kung-Fu]]'' featured antagonists with differing fighting styles, while ''[[The Way of the Exploding Fist]]'' further popularized the genre on home systems. In 1987, ''[[Street Fighter]]'' introduced hidden special attacks. In 1991, [[Capcom]]'s highly successful ''[[Street Fighter II]]'' refined and popularized many of the conventions of the genre. The fighting game subsequently became the preeminent genre for competitive video gaming in the early to mid-1990s, particularly in [[Video arcade|arcades]]. This period spawned dozens of other popular fighting games, including [[Media franchise|franchises]] like ''[[Street Fighter]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'', ''[[Tekken]]'', and ''[[Virtua Fighter]]''.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n==Definition==\nFighting games are a type of [[action game]] where two (or sometimes more) on-screen characters fight each other.<ref name=NGen15>{{cite magazine |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z: Fighting Game|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=33}}</ref><ref name=\"fundamentals\">{{cite book|last=Rollings|first=Andrew|authorlink=|author2=Ernest Adams|title=Fundamentals of Game Design|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2006|location=|url=http://wps.prenhall.com/bp_gamedev_1/54/14053/3597646.cw/index.html|access-date=February 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231072651/http://wps.prenhall.com/bp_gamedev_1/54/14053/3597646.cw/index.html|archive-date=December 31, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"ashcraft90\">{{cite book | author = Ashcraft, Brian | year = 2008 | title = Arcade Mania!

Most fighting games give the player the ability to execute a grapple move by pressing 2 or more buttons together or simply by pressing punch or kick while being extremely close the opponent. Other fighting games like ''Dead Or Alive'' have a unique button for throws and takedowns.\n\n====Projectiles====\nUsed primarily in 2D fighting games, projectiles are objects that a fighter can launch at another fighter to attack from a distance. While they can be used to simply inflict damage, projectiles are most often used to maneuver opponents into disadvantageous positions. The most notable projectile is Ryu and Ken's Hadoken from ''Street Fighter''.\n\n====Rushdown====\n{{see|Rush (video games)}}\nThe opposite of turtling, Rushdown refers to a number of specific, aggressive strategies, philosophies and play styles across all fighting games. The general goal of a rushdown player is to overwhelm the opponent and force costly mistakes either by using fast, confusing setups or by taking advantage of an impatient opponent as they are forced to play defense for prolonged periods of time. Rushdown players often favor attacking opponents in the corner or as they get up from a knockdown; both situations severely limit the options of the opponent and often allow the attacking player to force high-risk guessing scenarios.  \n\n====Spacing / Zoning====\nZoning is whatever series of tactics a player uses to keep their opponent at a specific distance. What exactly that distance is depends on both who the \"zoner\" and the opponent are using; differing based on the tools at their disposal versus the tools that the opposing player has.\n\n====Turtling====\n{{see|Turtling (gameplay)}}\nTurtling refers to fighting game tactic of playing very defensively and waiting for the opponent to make a move. It's somewhat of an extreme form of \"defensive play\".\n\n====Special attacks====\n\nAn integral feature of fighting games includes the use of \"special [[Strike (attack)|attacks]]\", also called \"secret moves\",<ref name=\"essential50\" /> that employ complex combinations of button presses to perform a particular move beyond basic punching and kicking.<ref>{{cite web | author = Towell, Justin | url = http://www.gamesradar.com/the-best-special-attacks-ever/ | title = The Best Special Attacks Ever | publisher = GamesRadar | accessdate = January 29, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120126204346/http://www.gamesradar.com/the-best-special-attacks-ever/ | archive-date = January 26, 2012 | url-status = live }}</ref> Combos, in which several attacks are chained together using basic punches and kicks, are another common feature in fighting games and have been fundamental to the genre since the release of ''Street Fighter II''.<ref name=\"Edge Street Fighter II\">{{cite journal |year=2003 |title=The making of ''Street Fighter II'' |journal=Edge Presents Retro |issue='The Making of...'

[[GameSpot]] regarded the game as \"perhaps the most highly anticipated fighter ever\" and called it the best fighting game ever to be released for a handheld console.<ref>{{cite web | author = Mielke, James | url = http://uk.gamespot.com/ngpc/action/snkvscapcommatchoftm/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;read-review | title = SNK vs. Capcom: Match of the Millennium Review | website = GameSpot | date = January 28, 2000 | accessdate = February 5, 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120715185555/http://uk.gamespot.com/ngpc/action/snkvscapcommatchoftm/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;read-review | archivedate = July 15, 2012 }}</ref><ref name = \"Capcom vs. SNK Review\">{{cite web | author = Lopez, Miguel | url =  http://uk.gamespot.com/dreamcast/action/capcomvssnkmf2000/review.html| title = Capcom vs. SNK Review | website = GameSpot | date = September 14, 2000 | accessdate = February 5, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Capcom released ''[[Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000]]'' for arcades and the [[Dreamcast]] in 2000, followed by sequels in subsequent years.
