They were a big success with the hit song \"[[Do It to It]]\".\n\nThe group first rose to fame in 2003, when they were featured on the single \"[[In Love wit Chu]]\", by [[Da Brat]]. They quickly followed up with their official debut single, \"[[Miss P.]]\", which had minor success on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart in the US. After the failure of the single, their initial debut album was cancelled. However, they continued recording music, and lent their vocals to the soundtrack for ''[[The Powerpuff Girls Movie]]''. In 2006, they released their second official single, \"[[Do It to It]]\". The single was met with critical and commercial success, and was followed up with their debut album, ''[[Unappreciated]]'', which reached number 4 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart in the US eventually selling 1.021 million copies in the U.S and 1.5 million worldwide.  2008 saw the release of the group's second studio album, ''[[The Truth (Cherish album)|The Truth]]''. The album didn't fare as well as their previous, failing to reach the top 20 on the ''Billboard'' 200 albums chart. It was, however, preceded by the release of their second Top 40 hit, \"[[Killa (Cherish song)|Killa]]\", which peaked at number 39 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\nFallon and Felisha also compose music for other artists. Felisha wrote songs for [[Tamar Braxton]] and [[Sevyn Streeter]] and co-wrote [[Jacob Latimore]]'s song Climb together with Fallon.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and career beginnings===\nThe group originally consisted of four sisters.

Originally from [[Maywood, Illinois]], the four sisters moved to [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to begin their musical career. The girls stated that they have been a group since the oldest, Farrah, was two years old.

The single reached the top 10 of the [[Rhythmic (chart)|''Billboard'' Rhythmic Top 40]] chart, peaking at number 9. The single also became a success on the [[Hot Rap Songs]] chart, peaking at number 12. On the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, the single narrowly missed the top 40, peaking at number 44.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/300055/da+brat/chart|title=Da Brat - Chart history {{!}} Billboard|website=Billboard.com|access-date=2016-04-23}}</ref>\n\n===2003&ndash;04: ''The Moment''===\nCherish's first solo single, entitled \"Miss P.\", was produced by [[Jermaine Dupri]], written by [[Kandi Burruss|Kandi]] and featured [[Da Brat]]. They had been signed to [[Warner Bros.]]' imprint Reprise Records. After the success of their collaboration with [[Da Brat]], the single was expected to be a hit. However, the single failed to chart on any major charts in the U.S. or countries other than the girl's own. It did, however, have minor success on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart in the United States, where it peaked at number 87. Other than a performance of the song on ''[[Soul Train]]'' in May 2003, the single received little promotion, which can be attributed to its commercial failure. Due to the commercial failure of its lead single, the group's debut album, titled ''The Moment'', was shelved a few months later. After their album was dropped, the group recorded three songs for ''The Powerpuff Girls: Power Pop'' soundtrack, called \"Chemical X\", \"Power of a Female\", and \"Me and My Girls\". A music video for \"Power of the Female\" was released as a promotional single on Cartoon Network in mid-2003.\n\n===2005&ndash;07: ''Unappreciated''===\nIn 2005, the girls began work on another album, since their previous album had been shelved. They wrote almost the entire album and said this work is so much more mature and themselves than their unreleased previous work. The album had productions from [[Jermaine Dupri]], Don Vito, and [[Jazze Pha]]. On March 21, 2006, Cherish released their first single in three years, titled [[Do It to It]]. The single featured [[Sean P]] on guest vocals. The single was met to a positive critical reception, as well as a strong commercial reception. The single was met with a large amount of success in the US, charting on several ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts. The single became their first to reach the top 20 of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, when it peaked at number 12.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.awcbee.com/2008/03/24/28/ |title=AWCbee \u2013 News: Music, Movie, Films \u00bb Blog Archive \u00bb Group Cherish \u2013 Do It to It |publisher=Awcbee.com |date=2008-03-24 |accessdate=2013-07-19}}</ref> The single was also success on the [[Pop 100]] chart, where it peaked at number 2, as well as the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart, reaching a peak of number 10 on that chart. The single also was a major hit in [[New Zealand]], peaking at number 3 on the official singles chart. The song also climbed to the top 40 in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], peaking at number 30 and 34 respectively. The song also charted in countries such as [[Australia]], peaking at number 67, [[Germany]], peaking at number 87, and [[France]], reaching a peak of number 48.\n\nAfter the success of \"Do It to It\", their debut album was released on August 15, 2006 on [[Capitol Records]] and was named ''Unappreciated''. It debuted at number four on the ''Billboard'' 200 selling 91,000 copies making it one of only a few R&B girl group projects to hit the top five on the chart in almost a year. The album also charted in Japan where it reached number 62 on the Oricon chart.<ref name=\"oricon.co.jp\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/323891/rank/album/ |title=\u30c1\u30a7\u30ea\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u306e\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30e0\u58f2\u4e0a\u30e9\u30f3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0 &#124; ORICON NEWS |website=Oricon.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2020-04-12}}</ref> In the [[United Kingdom]], the album debuted at number 80, and has since sold 30,000 copies in that country. As of September 21, 2006, the album has been certified Gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. On January 12, Cherish released the album's second single, the title track \"[[Unappreciated (song)|Unappreciated]]\". The single was received warmly by critics, however, it failed to achieve the commercial success that its predecessor had. In the US, the single peaked just outside the Top 40 of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 at number 41. It did have success on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]], peaking at number 20. In the UK, the single spent one week on the single's chart, when it debuted and peaked at 187. A third single titled \"Chevy\" was supposed to be released, however the song was only released as a promo single because in late 2006/early 2007 their label Capitol was merging with another record label which stopped all promotion and prevented [[Chingy]], [[LeToya Luckett]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Brooke Valentine]] & Cherish from releasing their next singles. By April 29, 2007 the album had sold over 1,021,000 copies in the United States.\n\nDuring this time Cherish was the only female group on select dates, as the opening act for Chris Brown's Up Close & Personal Tour, along with [[Ne-Yo]], [[Lil Wayne]], Julez Santana and [[Dem Franchize Boyz]], which ran from August to October. Cherish ended up cancelling a handful of their live shows, mainly their Californian concerts, due to rumors the group was very unorganized; it was stated that Neosha was the only member in the group who was committed. Farrah's son Jayden being sick caused the group to either cancel shows or shorten their live set when she was absent. However, Cherish then embarked on a European promotional tour in November, and finished up the year with a few Jingle Jam shows in December.\n\n===2007&ndash;10: ''The Truth'', Lineup Change, and ''F&F''===\nIn 2007, the girls confirmed that they were back in the studio recording for a new album. They later confirmed that the album would feature production from artist such as Don Vito, Blade, [[Jazze Pha]] and [[Tricky Stewart]]. In the Summer of 2007, a song titled \"Bat To the Range\", produced by The Clutch was leaked online. However, it was later confirmed that the song would not appear on the girls' second album. In October 2007, Cherish revealed the lead single from their second album would be released the following month. It was later confirmed that the single was called [[Killa (Cherish song)|Killa]], and would feature [[Yung Joc]] on guest vocals. The single was released for airplay and digital download on November 27, 2007. The video premiered via BET's Access Granted on December 12, featuring some scenes of the film ''[[Step Up 2: The Streets]]''. The video was directed by [[Little X]]. In the US, the single became another hit for the group. It became their second top 40 hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, reaching a peak of number 39. It also reached the top 40 of the [[Pop 100]], peaking at number 23. The single has become one of the group's poorest performing singles on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]], only reaching a peak of 53. On the [[UK Singles Chart]], the single climbed to a peak of 52, making it their second highest charting single to date. The single did become their first to chart in the [[Czech Republic]], where it peaked at number 10. It also became their second top 20 hit in [[New Zealand]], reaching a peak of number 18.\n\nTheir second album entitled ''The Truth'' was released on May 13, 2008. In a promotional interview, member Fallon said of the album, \"The biggest difference to me is the fact that you grow artistically whenever you're being creative and we've been creative for the past couple of years. Our artistry has grown. When we wrote The Truth, we named the album The Truth because basically every song on the album is from personal experiences and we wanted to get personal with our fans. We want everybody to know that they're not alone going through these things and we're here.\"<ref>[http://www.middlechildpromotions.com/interviews/cherish.html MiddleChild Promotions | MCP] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413091144/http://www.middlechildpromotions.com/interviews/cherish.html |date=April 13, 2008 }}</ref> The album was released in the UK on May 12, while the Japanese release is on May 14 and featured two bonus tracks, \"Do It to It\" (Rap Remix) and \"Silly\". In the US, the album only sold 13,000 copies in the first week of release, which led to it debuting at number 40 on the ''Billboard'' 200. In Japan, the album debuted at number 98 on the official album chart, and has sold only 2,300 copies in that country to date.<ref name=\"oricon.co.jp\"/> As of 2011, the album has sold only 30,000 copies in the United States. A second single from the album was released, titled \"[[Amnesia (Cherish song)|Amnesia]]\". The single failed to make an impact, however, missing the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 entirely. It did peak at number 61 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart, though.\n\nIn Spring 2008, Fallon and Felisha confirmed that they were working on a side project that didn't involve the other two members of the group. Under the name F+F, the girls began recording an album separate from Cherish. The fact they were working on solo projects made many fans speculate that the group was breaking up. In early 2009, a track by F+F called \"Infected\" was leaked online by an unknown source. This fueled the rumors of the band breaking up even more. Soon after, both Farrah and Neosha left the group, leaving just the duo of Fallon and Felisha. Not much was heard from Cherish until 2010 when Cherish released a tribute song to [[Haiti]] called ''The Voices Beyond''. A few weeks later, the duo filmed a music video for the song \"Don't Let Him Get Away\" by [[Rasheeda]], as the girls are featured on the track. On September 28, 2010, another track by F+F titled \"Lights Out\" was leaked online. Later in 2010, [[Capitol Records]] confirmed that the remaining members of Cherish would be releasing a new album, titled \"The Breakthrough\". On October 27, 2010, Fallon & Felisha did an exclusive interview with AceShowBiz, where they were asked on the status of Cherish as a group. Fallon responded by saying \"Cherish is a brand and a bond that is unbreakable. We plan on having a very long career in the music industry and to definitely release more albums as a group in the near future\". In mid-November 2010, music videos for both \"Infected\" and \"Lights Out\" were filmed but have yet to be released.\n\n===2011&ndash;present: New album and music===\nOn May 10, 2011, it was announced on Cherish's official Facebook that they would be working on a new album<ref name=\"Facebook\">{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/cherish |title=Cherish |publisher=Facebook |date=2012-03-01 |accessdate=2013-07-19}}</ref> On September 20, 2011, Cherish stated on their Facebook that they have reunited as a foursome and would be releasing new music in November.<ref name=\"Facebook\" />\n\nA song called \"Like That\" by Fallon and Felisha featured in the 2011 film ''[[S.W.A.T.: Firefight]]'' (sequel to 2003's ''[[S.W.A.T.

During an interview about the album, when asked about its composition, the group said: \"You can expect a lot of realness, [and] we're trying to bring real R&B back to the world. Right now, R&B is not a genre anymore. It's pop, it's hip-hop, it's other things.

When we came out in 2003, we were young and we didn't have much of a say in what went down. But this time around, we were able to write every song on the album, which makes this album very personal for all of us.\" They later added on, \"From this album you can expect realness.

The group originally included their older sisters Farrah and Neosha King but both have since departed the group. Originally from [[Maywood, Illinois]], the four sisters moved to [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to begin their musical career. Both their parents are musicians, their father having been in the band Professions of Sounds, who frequently toured across the South West with classic acts like [[The Emotions]] and [[Earth, Wind & Fire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/257/cherish_the_truth_nothing_but/ |title=Cherish interview by Pete Lewis, 'Blues & Soul' March 2008 |publisher=Bluesandsoul.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-19}}</ref> The group is signed to [[Capitol Records]] and [[Sho'nuff Records]]. They were a big success with the hit song \"[[Do It to It]]\".\n\nThe group first rose to fame in 2003, when they were featured on the single \"[[In Love wit Chu]]\", by [[Da Brat]]. They quickly followed up with their official debut single, \"[[Miss P.]]\", which had minor success on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart in the US. After the failure of the single, their initial debut album was cancelled. However, they continued recording music, and lent their vocals to the soundtrack for ''[[The Powerpuff Girls Movie]]''. In 2006, they released their second official single, \"[[Do It to It]]\". The single was met with critical and commercial success, and was followed up with their debut album, ''[[Unappreciated]]'', which reached number 4 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart in the US. 2008 saw the release of the group's second studio album, ''[[The Truth (Cherish album)|The Truth]]''. The album didn't fare as well as their previous, failing to reach the top 20 on the ''Billboard'' 200 albums chart. It was, however, preceded by the release of their second Top 40 hit, \"[[Killa (Cherish song)|Killa]]\", which peaked at number 39 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\nFallon and Felisha also compose music for other artists. Felisha wrote songs for [[Tamar Braxton]] and [[Sevyn Streeter]] and co-wrote [[Jacob Latimore]]'s song Climb together with Fallon.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and career beginnings===\nThe group originally consisted of four sisters. Farrah King (born {{birth date|1984|2|17}}), Neosha King (born {{birth date|1986|1|26}}) and twins Felisha and Fallon King (born {{birth date|1988|6|5}}). Originally from [[Maywood, Illinois]], the four sisters moved to [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to begin their musical career. The girls stated that they have been a group since the oldest, Farrah, was two years old. The girls were also quick to start singing professionally, starting when Farrah was only seven years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphop-elements.com/article/read/6/7120/1/ |title=Cherish Interview |publisher=HipHop-Elements.com |date=2007-10-02 |accessdate=2013-07-19}}</ref> The group also stated, in an interview with MTV, that their father was the one that brought them together, as their parents were singers as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtvhive.com/artist/cherish/videos/236318/buzzworthy_blog_exclusive_cherish_interview |title=Cherish >> Buzzworthy Blog Exclusive: Cherish Interview |publisher=MTV Hive |date= |accessdate=2013-07-19}}</ref> When asked about where their name came from, the girls stated, \"It's funny because we were sitting in the hotel room trying to come up with a name for the group. My father, which is our manager asked us \"well what do you cherish?\" Do you cherish what you do? We said yes and that's how the name Cherish came about.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.singersroom.com/interview/38/Cherish-A-New-Beginning|title=Cherish: A New Beginning|work=Singersroom.com}}</ref>\n\nCherish first rose to fame in 2003, when they teamed up with female hip hop artist [[Da Brat]] to record a duet with her. The finished track, titled \"[[In Love wit Chu]]\", was released on March 3, 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/in-love-wit-chu-feat-cherish/id304833412 |title=iTunes - Music - In Love Wit Chu (feat.

The single reached the top 10 of the [[Rhythmic (chart)|''Billboard'' Rhythmic Top 40]] chart, peaking at number 9. The single also became a success on the [[Hot Rap Songs]] chart, peaking at number 12. On the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, the single narrowly missed the top 40, peaking at number 44.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/300055/da+brat/chart|title=Da Brat - Chart history {{!}} Billboard|website=Billboard.com|access-date=2016-04-23}}</ref>\n\n===2003&ndash;04: ''The Moment''===\nCherish's first solo single, entitled \"Miss P.\", was produced by [[Jermaine Dupri]], written by [[Kandi Burruss|Kandi]] and featured [[Da Brat]]. They had been signed to [[Warner Bros.]]' imprint Reprise Records. After the success of their collaboration with [[Da Brat]], the single was expected to be a hit. However, the single failed to chart on any major charts in the U.S. or countries other than the girl's own. It did, however, have minor success on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart in the United States, where it peaked at number 87. Other than a performance of the song on ''[[Soul Train]]'' in May 2003, the single received little promotion, which can be attributed to its commercial failure. Due to the commercial failure of its lead single, the group's debut album, titled ''The Moment'', was shelved a few months later. After their album was dropped, the group recorded three songs for ''The Powerpuff Girls: Power Pop'' soundtrack, called \"Chemical X\", \"Power of a Female\", and \"Me and My Girls\". A music video for \"Power of the Female\" was released as a promotional single on Cartoon Network in mid-2003.\n\n===2005&ndash;07: ''Unappreciated''===\nIn 2005, the girls began work on another album, since their previous album had been shelved. They wrote almost the entire album and said this work is so much more mature and themselves than their unreleased previous work. The album had productions from [[Jermaine Dupri]], Don Vito, and [[Jazze Pha]]. On March 21, 2006, Cherish released their first single in three years, titled [[Do It to It]]. The single featured [[Sean P]] on guest vocals. The single was met to a positive critical reception, as well as a strong commercial reception. The single was met with a large amount of success in the US, charting on several ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts. The single became their first to reach the top 20 of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, when it peaked at number 12.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.awcbee.com/2008/03/24/28/ |title=AWCbee \u2013 News: Music, Movie, Films \u00bb Blog Archive \u00bb Group Cherish \u2013 Do It to It |publisher=Awcbee.com |date=2008-03-24 |accessdate=2013-07-19}}</ref> The single was also success on the [[Pop 100]] chart, where it peaked at number 2, as well as the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart, reaching a peak of number 10 on that chart. The single also was a major hit in [[New Zealand]], peaking at number 3 on the official singles chart. The song also climbed to the top 40 in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], peaking at number 30 and 34 respectively. The song also charted in countries such as [[Australia]], peaking at number 67, [[Germany]], peaking at number 87, and [[France]], reaching a peak of number 48.\n\nAfter the success of \"Do It to It\", their debut album was released on August 15, 2006 on [[Capitol Records]] and was named ''Unappreciated''. It debuted at number four on the ''Billboard'' 200 selling 91,000 copies making it one of only a few R&B girl group projects to hit the top five on the chart in almost a year. The album also charted in Japan where it reached number 62 on the Oricon chart.<ref name=\"oricon.co.jp\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/323891/rank/album/ |title=\u30c1\u30a7\u30ea\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u306e\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30e0\u58f2\u4e0a\u30e9\u30f3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0 &#124; ORICON NEWS |website=Oricon.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2020-04-12}}</ref> In the [[United Kingdom]], the album debuted at number 80, and has since sold 30,000 copies in that country. As of September 21, 2006, the album has been certified Gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. On January 12, Cherish released the album's second single, the title track \"[[Unappreciated (song)|Unappreciated]]\". The single was received warmly by critics, however, it failed to achieve the commercial success that its predecessor had. In the US, the single peaked just outside the Top 40 of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 at number 41. It did have success on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]], peaking at number 20. In the UK, the single spent one week on the single's chart, when it debuted and peaked at 187. A third single titled \"Chevy\" was supposed to be released, however the song was only released as a promo single because in late 2006/early 2007 their label Capitol was merging with another record label which stopped all promotion and prevented [[Chingy]], [[LeToya Luckett]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Brooke Valentine]] & Cherish from releasing their next singles. By April 29, 2007 the album had sold over 600,000 copies in the United States.\n\nDuring this time Cherish was the only female group on select dates, as the opening act for Chris Brown's Up Close & Personal Tour, along with [[Ne-Yo]], [[Lil Wayne]], Julez Santana and [[Dem Franchize Boyz]], which ran from August to October. Cherish ended up cancelling a handful of their live shows, mainly their Californian concerts, due to rumors the group was very unorganized; it was stated that Neosha was the only member in the group who was committed. Farrah's son Jayden being sick caused the group to either cancel shows or shorten their live set when she was absent. However, Cherish then embarked on a European promotional tour in November, and finished up the year with a few Jingle Jam shows in December.\n\n===2007&ndash;10: ''The Truth'', Lineup Change, and ''F&F''===\nIn 2007, the girls confirmed that they were back in the studio recording for a new album. They later confirmed that the album would feature production from artist such as Don Vito, Blade, [[Jazze Pha]] and [[Tricky Stewart]]. In the Summer of 2007, a song titled \"Bat To the Range\", produced by The Clutch was leaked online. However, it was later confirmed that the song would not appear on the girls' second album. In October 2007, Cherish revealed the lead single from their second album would be released the following month. It was later confirmed that the single was called [[Killa (Cherish song)|Killa]], and would feature [[Yung Joc]] on guest vocals. The single was released for airplay and digital download on November 27, 2007. The video premiered via BET's Access Granted on December 12, featuring some scenes of the film ''[[Step Up 2: The Streets]]''. The video was directed by [[Little X]]. In the US, the single became another hit for the group. It became their second top 40 hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, reaching a peak of number 39. It also reached the top 40 of the [[Pop 100]], peaking at number 23. The single has become one of the group's poorest performing singles on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]], only reaching a peak of 53. On the [[UK Singles Chart]], the single climbed to a peak of 52, making it their second highest charting single to date. The single did become their first to chart in the [[Czech Republic]], where it peaked at number 10. It also became their second top 20 hit in [[New Zealand]], reaching a peak of number 18.\n\nTheir second album entitled ''The Truth'' was released on May 13, 2008. In a promotional interview, member Fallon said of the album, \"The biggest difference to me is the fact that you grow artistically whenever you're being creative and we've been creative for the past couple of years. Our artistry has grown. When we wrote The Truth, we named the album The Truth because basically every song on the album is from personal experiences and we wanted to get personal with our fans. We want everybody to know that they're not alone going through these things and we're here.\"<ref>[http://www.middlechildpromotions.com/interviews/cherish.html MiddleChild Promotions | MCP] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413091144/http://www.middlechildpromotions.com/interviews/cherish.html |date=April 13, 2008 }}</ref> The album was released in the UK on May 12, while the Japanese release is on May 14 and featured two bonus tracks, \"Do It to It\" (Rap Remix) and \"Silly\". In the US, the album only sold 13,000 copies in the first week of release, which led to it debuting at number 40 on the ''Billboard'' 200. In Japan, the album debuted at number 98 on the official album chart, and has sold only 2,300 copies in that country to date.<ref name=\"oricon.co.jp\"/> As of 2011, the album has sold only 30,000 copies in the United States. A second single from the album was released, titled \"[[Amnesia (Cherish song)|Amnesia]]\". The single failed to make an impact, however, missing the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 entirely. It did peak at number 61 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart, though.\n\nIn Spring 2008, Fallon and Felisha confirmed that they were working on a side project that didn't involve the other two members of the group. Under the name F+F, the girls began recording an album separate from Cherish. The fact they were working on solo projects made many fans speculate that the group was breaking up. In early 2009, a track by F+F called \"Infected\" was leaked online by an unknown source. This fueled the rumors of the band breaking up even more. Soon after, both Farrah and Neosha left the group, leaving just the duo of Fallon and Felisha. Not much was heard from Cherish until 2010 when Cherish released a tribute song to [[Haiti]] called ''The Voices Beyond''. A few weeks later, the duo filmed a music video for the song \"Don't Let Him Get Away\" by [[Rasheeda]], as the girls are featured on the track. On September 28, 2010, another track by F+F titled \"Lights Out\" was leaked online. Later in 2010, [[Capitol Records]] confirmed that the remaining members of Cherish would be releasing a new album, titled \"The Breakthrough\". On October 27, 2010, Fallon & Felisha did an exclusive interview with AceShowBiz, where they were asked on the status of Cherish as a group. Fallon responded by saying \"Cherish is a brand and a bond that is unbreakable.

There are many other carom billiards games, predominantly intermediary or offshoot games combining elements of those already listed, such as the ''champion's game'', an intermediary game between straight rail and balkline, as well as games which are hybrids of carom billiards and [[pocket billiards]], such as ''[[English billiards]]'' played on a [[snooker]] table and its descendant games, ''American four-ball billiards'', and ''[[cowboy pool]]''.<ref name=\"IEOB\" />\n\nCarom billiards is considered obscure in the [[United States]] (being historically supplanted by [[pocket billiards]]), but are more popular in [[Europe]], particularly [[France]], where it originated.

The predecessor company of the most famous maker of billiard cloth, Iwan Simonis, was formed in 1453. Most cloth made for carom billiards tables is a type of [[baize]] that is dyed green, and is made from 100% [[worsted]] wool, which provides a very fast surface allowing the balls to travel with little resistance across the table {{Cuegloss|Bed|bed}}. The green color of cloth was originally chosen to emulate the look of grass, and has been so colored since the 16th century. However, as in [[green eyeshade]]s, the color also serves a useful function: Humans have a higher light sensitivity to green than to any other color, so green cloth permits play for longer periods of time without [[Asthenopia|eye strain]].<ref name=\"IEOB\"/><ref>Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2004).

The dominant material from 1627 until the early- to mid-20th century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental or animal-welfare concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred on by a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was celluloid, invented by [[John Wesley Hyatt]] in 1868, but the material was volatile and highly inflammable, sometimes exploding during manufacture.<ref name=\"IEOB\" /><ref>''The New York Times'' (16 September 1875).

It is a factor that occurs every time {{Cuegloss|english}} ({{Cuegloss|Side|side}}) is employed, and its effects are magnified by speed.

A heated table is required under international tournament rules. It is an especially important requirement for the games of three-cushion billiards and artistic billiards, and even local billiard halls often have this feature in countries where carom games are popular. Heating table beds is an old practice. [[Queen Victoria]] (1819\u20131901) had a billiard table that was heated using [[zinc]] tubes, although the aim at that time was chiefly to keep the then-used ivory balls from warping.

It was known as French caroms, French billiards, or the French game in early times, taking those bygone names from the French who popularized it. The object of straight rail is simple: one point, called a \"count\", is scored each time a player's cue ball makes contact with both object balls (the second cue ball and the third ball) on a single {{Cuegloss|Stroke|stroke}}. A win is achieved by reaching an agreed upon number of counts.<ref name=\"IEOB\" />\n\nAt straight rail's inception there was no restriction on the manner of scoring. However, the technique of ''crotching'', or freezing two balls into the corner where the rails meet\u2014the ''crotch''\u2014vastly increasing counts, resulted in an 1862 rule which allowed only three counts before at least one ball had to be driven away. Techniques continued to develop which increased counts greatly despite the crotching prohibition, especially the development of a variety of \"{{Cuegloss|Nurse|nurse}}\" techniques. The most important of these, the ''{{Cuegloss|Rail nurse|rail nurse}}'', involves the progressive nudging of the object balls down a rail, ideally moving them just a few centimeters on each count, keeping them close together and positioned at the end of each stroke in the same or near the same configuration such that the nurse can be replicated again and again.<ref name=\"IEOB\" />\n\nStraight rail is still popular in Europe, where it is considered a fine practice game for both balkline and three-cushion billiards. Additionally, Europe hosts professional competitions known as ''[[pentathlon]]s'' after the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] Olympic athletic competitions, in which straight rail is featured as one of five billiards disciplines at which players compete, the other four being 47.1 balkline, [[cushion caroms]], 71.2 balkline, and three-cushion billiards.<ref name=\"IEOB\" />\n\nStraight rail was played professionally in the United States from 1873 to 1879, but is uncommon there today.<ref name=\"IEOB\" />\n\n===The champion's game===\n{{further|Balkline and straight rail}}\nThe new game appearing in 1879, called the champion's game or limited-rail, is considered an intermediary game between straight rail and balkline and was designed with the specific intent of frustrating the rail nurse.<ref name=\"IEOB\" /> The game employed diagonal lines&mdash;balklines&mdash;at the table's corners to regions where counts were restricted, thus \"cutting off four triangular spaces in the four corners, [taking] away {{convert|711|mm|0|abbr=on}} of the 'nursing' surface of the end rails and {{convert|1422|mm|0|abbr=on}} on the long rails.\"<ref>''The New York Times'' (10 November 1879).

This divides the table into nine rectangular balkspaces. Additionally, rectangles are drawn where each balkline meets a rail, called ''anchor spaces'', which developed to stop a number of nursing techniques that exploited the fact that if the object balls straddled a balkline, no count limit was in place.<ref name=\"IEOB\" />\n\nFor the most part, the differences between one balkline game to another is defined by two measures: 1) the spacing of the balklines, and 2) the number of points that are allowed in each balk space before at least one ball must leave the region. Generally, balkline games and their particular restrictions are given numerical names indicating both of these characteristics; the first number indicated either inches or centimeters depending on the game, and the second, after a dot or a slash, indicates the count restriction in balk spaces, which is always either one or two. For example, in ''18.2 balkline'', one of the more prominent balkline games and of US origin, the name indicates that balklines are drawn 18&nbsp;inches distant from each rail, and only two counts are allowed in a balk space before a ball must leave. In the heavily French-influenced lingo of carom billiards, the first of these shots is called the {{lang|fr|entr\u00e9e}} and the second the {{lang|fr|dedans}}; in 18.1 or any other one-count balkline game, the one permitted count is called {{lang|fr|dedans}}.<ref name=\"IEOB\" /><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1924/08/10/archives/change-is-planned-in-balkline-game-miller-proposal-would-eliminate.html |title=Change Is Planned in Balkline Game; Miller Proposal Would Eliminate Four of Nine Zones in Effort to Stop Long Runs|date=August 10, 1924|work=The New York Times|page=24|url-access=subscription |access-date=May 4, 2010}}</ref> By contrast, in ''71.2 balkline'', of French invention, lines are drawn 71 centimeters distant from each rail, also with a two-count restriction for balk spaces.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1937/12/07/archives/sports-of-the-times-reg-u-s-pat-off.html |title=Sports of the Times; Reg.

There are many other carom billiards games, predominantly intermediary or offshoot games combining elements of those already listed, such as the ''champion's game'', an intermediary game between straight rail and balkline, as well as games which are hybrids of carom billiards and [[pocket billiards]], such as ''[[English billiards]]'' played on a [[snooker]] table and its descendant games, ''American four-ball billiards'', and ''[[cowboy pool]]''.<ref name=\"IEOB\" />\n\nCarom billiards is considered obscure in the [[United States]] (being historically supplanted by [[pocket billiards]]), but are more popular in [[Europe]], particularly [[France]], where it originated.

The predecessor company of the most famous maker of billiard cloth, Iwan Simonis, was formed in 1453. Most cloth made for carom billiards tables is a type of [[baize]] that is dyed green, and is made from 100% [[worsted]] wool, which provides a very fast surface allowing the balls to travel with little resistance across the table {{Cuegloss|Bed|bed}}. The green color of cloth was originally chosen to emulate the look of grass, and has been so colored since the 16th century. However, as in [[green eyeshade]]s, the color also serves a useful function: Humans have a higher light sensitivity to green than to any other color, so green cloth permits play for longer periods of time without [[Asthenopia|eye strain]].<ref name=\"IEOB\"/><ref>Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2004).

The dominant material from 1627 until the early- to mid-20th century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental or animal-welfare concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred on by a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was celluloid, invented by [[John Wesley Hyatt]] in 1868, but the material was volatile and highly inflammable, sometimes exploding during manufacture.<ref name=\"IEOB\" /><ref>''The New York Times'' (16 September 1875).

A heated table is required under international tournament rules. It is an especially important requirement for the games of three-cushion billiards and artistic billiards, and even local billiard halls often have this feature in countries where carom games are popular. Heating table beds is an old practice. [[Queen Victoria]] (1819\u20131901) had a billiard table that was heated using [[zinc]] tubes, although the aim at that time was chiefly to keep the then-used ivory balls from warping.

It was known as French caroms, French billiards, or the French game in early times, taking those bygone names from the French who popularized it. The object of straight rail is simple: one point, called a \"count\", is scored each time a player's cue ball makes contact with both object balls (the second cue ball and the third ball) on a single {{Cuegloss|Stroke|stroke}}. A win is achieved by reaching an agreed upon number of counts.<ref name=\"IEOB\" />\n\nAt straight rail's inception there was no restriction on the manner of scoring. However, the technique of ''crotching'', or freezing two balls into the corner where the rails meet\u2014the ''crotch''\u2014vastly increasing counts, resulted in an 1862 rule which allowed only three counts before at least one ball had to be driven away. Techniques continued to develop which increased counts greatly despite the crotching prohibition, especially the development of a variety of \"{{Cuegloss|Nurse|nurse}}\" techniques. The most important of these, the ''{{Cuegloss|Rail nurse|rail nurse}}'', involves the progressive nudging of the object balls down a rail, ideally moving them just a few centimeters on each count, keeping them close together and positioned at the end of each stroke in the same or near the same configuration such that the nurse can be replicated again and again.<ref name=\"IEOB\" />\n\nStraight rail is still popular in Europe, where it is considered a fine practice game for both balkline and three-cushion billiards.

This divides the table into nine rectangular balkspaces. Additionally, rectangles are drawn where each balkline meets a rail, called ''anchor spaces'', which developed to stop a number of nursing techniques that exploited the fact that if the object balls straddled a balkline, no count limit was in place.<ref name=\"IEOB\" />\n\nFor the most part, the differences between one balkline game to another is defined by two measures: 1) the spacing of the balklines, and 2) the number of points that are allowed in each balk space before at least one ball must leave the region. Generally, balkline games and their particular restrictions are given numerical names indicating both of these characteristics; the first number indicated either inches or centimeters depending on the game, and the second, after a dot or a slash, indicates the count restriction in balk spaces, which is always either one or two. For example, in ''18.2 balkline'', one of the more prominent balkline games and of US origin, the name indicates that balklines are drawn 18&nbsp;inches distant from each rail, and only two counts are allowed in a balk space before a ball must leave. In the heavily French-influenced lingo of carom billiards, the first of these shots is called the {{lang|fr|entr\u00e9e}} and the second the {{lang|fr|dedans}}; in 18.1 or any other one-count balkline game, the one permitted count is called {{lang|fr|dedans}}.<ref name=\"IEOB\" /><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1924/08/10/archives/change-is-planned-in-balkline-game-miller-proposal-would-eliminate.html |title=Change Is Planned in Balkline Game; Miller Proposal Would Eliminate Four of Nine Zones in Effort to Stop Long Runs|date=August 10, 1924|work=The New York Times|page=24|url-access=subscription |access-date=May 4, 2010}}</ref> By contrast, in ''71.2 balkline'', of French invention, lines are drawn 71 centimeters distant from each rail, also with a two-count restriction for balk spaces.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1937/12/07/archives/sports-of-the-times-reg-u-s-pat-off.html |title=Sports of the Times; Reg.

On 20 October the 2nd Dublins took part in the first major battle of the war, the [[Battle of Talana Hill]] near [[Dundee, KwaZulu-Natal|Dundee]]. The Boers had appeared on Talana Hill in the early morning and after they launched a few shells at Dundee, the garrison responded and attacked the hill. The 2nd Dublins took part in the attack and, after some fierce fighting, removed the Boers. They suffered heavy casualties in the process, losing, amongst others, Captain George Anderson Weldon, the first officer of the Dublins to be killed in the war. The British had to abandon Dundee soon afterwards, withdrawing to [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith]]. The Boers besieged the town in late October. On 30 October the garrison's commander, Sir [[George White (British Army officer)|George Stuart White]] VC, ordered an attack on [[Battle of Ladysmith#Lombard's Kop|Lombard's Kop]] which the Dublin Fusiliers took part in.<ref>Mainwaring and Romer, pp. 22-28</ref>\n\nOn 15 November 1899, a detachment of Dubliners and the [[Durban Light Infantry]] were garrisoning an [[armoured train]] operating from [[Estcourt]] with the objective of monitoring Boer movements. The Boers ambushed them on their return and a section of the train was de-railed in the chaos. Among the passengers was [[Winston Churchill]], then a war correspondent accompanying the detachment, who helped load the train engine with wounded before it made an escape attempt, pushing through the de-railed section that blocked its path and making it through safely. The remaining troops put up a stout defence until they were eventually compelled to surrender, including Churchill who had returned to the remaining defenders. Churchill later made a successful escape attempt from his prison in [[Pretoria]]. He wrote glowingly of the gallantry displayed by the Dublin Fusiliers and the other troops that were present during the ambush. The Dublins lost three men during the ambush.<ref>{{cite web|title=Talana Hill Memorial|url=http://www.eggsa.org/library/main.php?g2_itemId=646048|publisher=The Genealogical Society of South Africa|accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Dublin Fusiliers actively took part in the efforts to lift the [[Siege of Ladysmith]], which lasted from 30 October 1899 to 28 February 1900. On 15 December the 2nd Dublins took part in the [[Battle of Colenso]]. The Dublins were part of the 5th Brigade (known as the [[5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|Irish Brigade]]) who crossed the wrong part of the [[Tugela River]] and suffered heavy casualties in the process. The battle was a defeat for the British forces and became part of a notorious period for the British in the war, known as \"[[Black Week]]\". The defeat, however, did not discourage further attempts being made. The Dublins did not participate in any more attempts until January 1900 when they took part in the Tugela campaign, collectively known as the [[Battle of the Tugela Heights]]. February saw the Dublins take part in heavy fighting before, on 27 February, they supported the [[Royal Irish Fusiliers]] in their final charge on Pieters Hill, suffering heavy casualties though taking the position. This victory led to the siege of Ladysmith being lifted the following day by cavalry, with the main force of infantry arriving on 3 March. On 10 March 1900 [[Queen Victoria]] decreed that a sprig of [[shamrock]] be adorned on the headdress of Irish units on [[Saint Patrick's Day]] to commemorate their actions in South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Royal Irish|url=https://www.royal-irish.com/events/saint-patrick%E2%80%99s-day-and-the-sprig-of-shamrock|title=Saint Patrick\u2019s Day and the Sprig of Shamrock|accessdate=17 July 2016}}</ref> This tradition remains in existence with Irish units of the British Army.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Irish Guards in Kenya  |author= Amanda Dellor  |author2= Faye Harland |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/berkshire/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8580000/8580437.stm  |publisher=[[BBC]]  |date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=15 November 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn May, the British began their advance towards the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], one of the Boer republics, and early the following month the Dublins took part in the effort against [[Battle of Laing's Nek|Laing's Nek]] during the attempt to achieve an entry into the Transvaal. This was successfully achieved and the capital, [[Pretoria]], was captured on 5 June. The war, however, did not end and the Boers began a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign against the British. During this phase of the war, many [[blockhouse]]s were constructed to help restrict the movement of the Boer guerrillas and men of the Dublin Fusiliers helped to garrison them. This phase of the war also saw the [[mounted infantry]] companies, among which were Dublin Fusiliers MI, in their element, hunting the (now small) groups of Boers. The Dublin Fusiliers also took part in the hunt for [[Christiaan de Wet]], a prominent Boer officer.<ref>Mainwaring and Romer, pp. 121-141</ref>\n\nThe last of the Boers surrendered in May 1902, the [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] formally ending the conflict. During the war, volunteers from the three [[militia]] battalions of the Dublins had been used to provide reinforcements for the two regular battalions fighting in South Africa. The 2nd Dublins had left South Africa in January 1902. The Dublins suffered nearly 700 casualties (killed, wounded, missing) during the conflict, many of whom died of disease, indeed the vast majority of British Army casualties were from disease.<ref>Mainwaring and Romer, p. 239</ref>\n\nThe 4th ([[Militia (United Kingdom)|Militia]]) battalion, formed from the Royal Dublin City Militia in 1881, was one of the reserve battalions. It was embodied in May 1900, disembodied in December the same year, and later re-embodied for service in South Africa during the Second Boer War. About 540 officers and men returned to Southampton on the SS ''Cestrian'' in early October 1902, when the battalion was disembodied at Dublin.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Army in South Africa - Troops returning home| day_of_week=Wednesday |date=17 September 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36875}}</ref>\n\nA music hall song commemorating the bravery of the fusiliers was entitled: \"What Do You Think of the Irish Now?\" by Albert Hall and Harry Castling.

The 2nd Dublins took part in the retreat following the [[Battle of Mons]], taking part in their first engagement on 26 August 1914 at [[Battle of Le Cateau|Le Cateau]]<ref name=igws/> that helped delay the German advance towards [[Paris]], inflicting such heavy casualties that the Germans thought they faced more machine-guns than they actually did. The BEF then resumed their retreat, but many men, including from the Dublin Fusiliers, were stranded behind German lines, and many were taken prisoner by the Germans. The Battalion, badly depleted, later took part in the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] (5\u20139 September) that finally halted the German advance just on the outskirts of Paris, forcing the Germans to retreat to the [[Aisne]].<ref name=igws/> There, the 2nd Dublins took part in the [[First Battle of the Aisne|Battle of the Aisne]] and later took part in their last major engagement of the war, at the [[Battle of Messines (1914)|Battle of Messines]], which began on 12 October and ended on 2 November.<ref name=igws/>\n\nThe 2nd Dublins took part in all but one of the subsidiary battles during [[Second Battle of Ypres|Second Ypres]] that took place between 22 April&nbsp;\u2013 24 May 1915.

The British launched the Somme offensive on 1 July and the 1st and 2nd Dublins took part in the [[First day on the Somme]] that saw the British forces sustain horrific casualties, some 60,000, about 20,000 of which were killed. The 8th and 9th Dublins took part in their first major battle during the Somme Offensive, taking part in the capture of [[Battle of Ginchy|Ginchy]] on 9 September, in which Lieutenant [[Tom Kettle]] fell in action.<ref name=igws/> The Dublins also took part in the last major battle of the offensive, at the [[Battle of the Ancre|Ancre]] that took place between 13\u201318 November. The Dublins, once again, had suffered large numbers of casualties during the Somme offensive.<ref name=igws/>\n\nIn March 1917 the Germans retreated to the [[Hindenburg Line]] which was a formidable series of defences that the Germans had constructed. In April the British launched the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras Offensive]] and the Dublin Fusiliers took part in the two battles of the Scarpe that took place in April. The 10th Dublins took part in the [[Battle of Arleux]] (28\u201329 April) that saw the Dublins last involvement in a major battle of the Arras offensive. Half of the [[French Army]], exhausted and angry at the enormous losses it had sustained, mutinied, refusing to fight unless it was to defend against German attacks. This compelled the British Army to take the leading role, and this would see the Dublin Fusiliers take part in further offensives before the year ended. In June, the Dublins took part in the capture of [[Heuvelland|Wytschaete]] during the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]]. The Regiment's battalions subsequently took part in the [[Third Battle of Ypres]] (31 July&nbsp;\u201310 November), being involved in several of its subsidiary battles, including at [[Battle of Langemarck (1917)|Langemarck]]. As during Second Ypres, the Regiment suffered heavily, indeed the 9th Dublins had sustained such losses that they effectively ceased to be a fighting unit, and were amalgamated with the 8th Dublins in October, forming the 8th/9th Dublins. The Regiment's last major action of 1917 was a diversionary attack during the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] (28 November&nbsp;\u2013 3 December).<ref name=igws/>\n\nIn February 1918, due to the heavy losses that had been sustained, the 8th/9th and 10th Dublins were disbanded and its men were transferred to the 1st and 2nd Dublins. On 21 March the Regiment was on the defensive during the [[Operation Michael#Battle of St. Quentin (21\u201323 March 1918)|Battle of St. Quentin]] when the Germans began an immense bombardment as part of their last-gasp major offensive known as [[Operation Michael]] against British and [[Allies of World War I|Empire]] forces in the [[Picardy]] area. The 1st and 2nd Dublins suffered heavily from the intense bombardment (which included poison gas) and when the Germans attacked shortly afterwards, the Germans broke through the shattered remnants. The Germans made significant gains but their offensive gradually lost momentum and the Germans were pushed back by April. During that month, on 14 April, the 1st and 2nd Dublins had to briefly amalgamate due to the losses it had sustained during the German offensive, forming the 1st/2nd Dublins. The 1st Battalion was reconstituted a few days later with drafts from the 2nd Battalion, which was reduced to [[Cadre (military)|cadre]] strength.<ref name=trail/> On 26 April the 1st Dublins left the 16th (Irish) and rejoined the 86th Brigade, 29th Division. In June the 2nd Dublins transferred to the [[31st Division (United Kingdom)|31st Division]] and was reconstituted.<ref name=trail/> It was transferred to the Lines of Communication (LoC) before moving to [[50th (Northumbrian) Division|50th Division]] in July. In August the Allies launched their counter-offensive against the Germans and eventually reached the Hindenburg Line. The Allies launched their offensive against the Line in September, and the 1st, 2nd, and 7th Dublins, took part in the battles of the [[Second Battle of the Somme (1918)|St Quentin Canal]], [[Battle of Cambrai (1918)|Cambrai]] and [[Battle of Beaurevoir|Beaurevoir]], and the Hindenburg Line was successfully breached by the Allies. The Dublins took part in the last offensives of the war, taking part in, among others, the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Fourth Battle of Ypres]], [[Battle of Courtrai (1918)|Battle of Courtrai]] and the [[Battle of the Selle]] during September and October.

The Dublins landed at Suvla on 7 August; a day after the first landings there had taken place. Unlike at V Beach at Helles, Suvla was barely defended but incompetence at the higher echelons of command led to the British troops not exploiting their early advantage, ensuring that the Suvla landings became static and allowing the Turks to reinforce their defences. The Dublins took part in the effort to capture a position known as Chocolate Hill (7\u20138 August),<ref name=igws/> which was successfully taken, though at a heavy cost.

On 20 October the 2nd Dublins took part in the first major battle of the war, the [[Battle of Talana Hill]] near [[Dundee, KwaZulu-Natal|Dundee]]. The Boers had appeared on Talana Hill in the early morning and after they launched a few shells at Dundee, the garrison responded and attacked the hill. The 2nd Dublins took part in the attack and, after some fierce fighting, removed the Boers. They suffered heavy casualties in the process, losing, amongst others, Captain George Anderson Weldon, the first officer of the Dublins to be killed in the war. The British had to abandon Dundee soon afterwards, withdrawing to [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith]]. The Boers besieged the town in late October. On 30 October the garrison's commander, Sir [[George White (British Army officer)|George Stuart White]] VC, ordered an attack on [[Battle of Ladysmith#Lombard's Kop|Lombard's Kop]] which the Dublin Fusiliers took part in.<ref>Mainwaring and Romer, pp. 22-28</ref>\n\nOn 15 November 1899, a detachment of Dubliners and the [[Durban Light Infantry]] were garrisoning an [[armoured train]] operating from [[Estcourt]] with the objective of monitoring Boer movements. The Boers ambushed them on their return and a section of the train was de-railed in the chaos. Among the passengers was [[Winston Churchill]], then a war correspondent accompanying the detachment, who helped load the train engine with wounded before it made an escape attempt, pushing through the de-railed section that blocked its path and making it through safely. The remaining troops put up a stout defence until they were eventually compelled to surrender, including Churchill who had returned to the remaining defenders. Churchill later made a successful escape attempt from his prison in [[Pretoria]]. He wrote glowingly of the gallantry displayed by the Dublin Fusiliers and the other troops that were present during the ambush. The Dublins lost three men during the ambush.<ref>{{cite web|title=Talana Hill Memorial|url=http://www.eggsa.org/library/main.php?g2_itemId=646048|publisher=The Genealogical Society of South Africa|accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Dublin Fusiliers actively took part in the efforts to lift the [[Siege of Ladysmith]], which lasted from 30 October 1899 to 28 February 1900. On 15 December the 2nd Dublins took part in the [[Battle of Colenso]]. The Dublins were part of the 5th Brigade (known as the [[5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|Irish Brigade]]) who crossed the wrong part of the [[Tugela River]] and suffered heavy casualties in the process. The battle was a defeat for the British forces and became part of a notorious period for the British in the war, known as \"[[Black Week]]\". The defeat, however, did not discourage further attempts being made. The Dublins did not participate in any more attempts until January 1900 when they took part in the Tugela campaign, collectively known as the [[Battle of the Tugela Heights]]. February saw the Dublins take part in heavy fighting before, on 27 February, they supported the [[Royal Irish Fusiliers]] in their final charge on Pieters Hill, suffering heavy casualties though taking the position. This victory led to the siege of Ladysmith being lifted the following day by cavalry, with the main force of infantry arriving on 3 March. On 10 March 1900 [[Queen Victoria]] decreed that a sprig of [[shamrock]] be adorned on the headdress of Irish units on [[Saint Patrick's Day]] to commemorate their actions in South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Royal Irish|url=https://www.royal-irish.com/events/saint-patrick%E2%80%99s-day-and-the-sprig-of-shamrock|title=Saint Patrick\u2019s Day and the Sprig of Shamrock|accessdate=17 July 2016}}</ref> This tradition remains in existence with Irish units of the British Army.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Irish Guards in Kenya  |author= Amanda Dellor  |author2= Faye Harland |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/berkshire/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8580000/8580437.stm  |publisher=[[BBC]]  |date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=15 November 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn May, the British began their advance towards the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], one of the Boer republics, and early the following month the Dublins took part in the effort against [[Battle of Laing's Nek|Laing's Nek]] during the attempt to achieve an entry into the Transvaal. This was successfully achieved and the capital, [[Pretoria]], was captured on 5 June. The war, however, did not end and the Boers began a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign against the British. During this phase of the war, many [[blockhouse]]s were constructed to help restrict the movement of the Boer guerrillas and men of the Dublin Fusiliers helped to garrison them. This phase of the war also saw the [[mounted infantry]] companies, among which were Dublin Fusiliers MI, in their element, hunting the (now small) groups of Boers. The Dublin Fusiliers also took part in the hunt for [[Christiaan de Wet]], a prominent Boer officer.<ref>Mainwaring and Romer, pp. 121-141</ref>\n\nThe last of the Boers surrendered in May 1902, the [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] formally ending the conflict. During the war, volunteers from the three [[militia]] battalions of the Dublins had been used to provide reinforcements for the two regular battalions fighting in South Africa. The 2nd Dublins had left South Africa in January 1902. The Dublins suffered nearly 700 casualties (killed, wounded, missing) during the conflict, many of whom died of disease, indeed the vast majority of British Army casualties were from disease.<ref>Mainwaring and Romer, p. 239</ref>\n\nThe 4th ([[Militia (United Kingdom)|Militia]]) battalion, formed from the Royal Dublin City Militia in 1881, was one of the reserve battalions. It was embodied in May 1900, disembodied in December the same year, and later re-embodied for service in South Africa during the Second Boer War. About 540 officers and men returned to Southampton on the SS ''Cestrian'' in early October 1902, when the battalion was disembodied at Dublin.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Army in South Africa - Troops returning home| day_of_week=Wednesday |date=17 September 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36875}}</ref>\n\nA music hall song commemorating the bravery of the fusiliers was entitled: \"What Do You Think of the Irish Now?\" by Albert Hall and Harry Castling.

The BEF then resumed their retreat, but many men, including from the Dublin Fusiliers, were stranded behind German lines, and many were taken prisoner by the Germans. The Battalion, badly depleted, later took part in the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] (5\u20139 September) that finally halted the German advance just on the outskirts of Paris, forcing the Germans to retreat to the [[Aisne]].<ref name=igws/> There, the 2nd Dublins took part in the [[First Battle of the Aisne|Battle of the Aisne]] and later took part in their last major engagement of the war, at the [[Battle of Messines (1914)|Battle of Messines]], which began on 12 October and ended on 2 November.<ref name=igws/>\n\nThe 2nd Dublins took part in all but one of the subsidiary battles during [[Second Battle of Ypres|Second Ypres]] that took place between 22 April&nbsp;\u2013 24 May 1915.

The British launched the Somme offensive on 1 July and the 1st and 2nd Dublins took part in the [[First day on the Somme]] that saw the British forces sustain horrific casualties, some 60,000, about 20,000 of which were killed. The 8th and 9th Dublins took part in their first major battle during the Somme Offensive, taking part in the capture of [[Battle of Ginchy|Ginchy]] on 9 September, in which Lieutenant [[Tom Kettle]] fell in action.<ref name=igws/> The Dublins also took part in the last major battle of the offensive, at the [[Battle of the Ancre|Ancre]] that took place between 13\u201318 November. The Dublins, once again, had suffered large numbers of casualties during the Somme offensive.<ref name=igws/>\n\nIn March 1917 the Germans retreated to the [[Hindenburg Line]] which was a formidable series of defences that the Germans had constructed. In April the British launched the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Arras Offensive]] and the Dublin Fusiliers took part in the two battles of the Scarpe that took place in April. The 10th Dublins took part in the [[Battle of Arleux]] (28\u201329 April) that saw the Dublins last involvement in a major battle of the Arras offensive. Half of the [[French Army]], exhausted and angry at the enormous losses it had sustained, mutinied, refusing to fight unless it was to defend against German attacks. This compelled the British Army to take the leading role, and this would see the Dublin Fusiliers take part in further offensives before the year ended. In June, the Dublins took part in the capture of [[Heuvelland|Wytschaete]] during the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]]. The Regiment's battalions subsequently took part in the [[Third Battle of Ypres]] (31 July&nbsp;\u201310 November), being involved in several of its subsidiary battles, including at [[Battle of Langemarck (1917)|Langemarck]]. As during Second Ypres, the Regiment suffered heavily, indeed the 9th Dublins had sustained such losses that they effectively ceased to be a fighting unit, and were amalgamated with the 8th Dublins in October, forming the 8th/9th Dublins. The Regiment's last major action of 1917 was a diversionary attack during the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] (28 November&nbsp;\u2013 3 December).<ref name=igws/>\n\nIn February 1918, due to the heavy losses that had been sustained, the 8th/9th and 10th Dublins were disbanded and its men were transferred to the 1st and 2nd Dublins. On 21 March the Regiment was on the defensive during the [[Operation Michael#Battle of St. Quentin (21\u201323 March 1918)|Battle of St. Quentin]] when the Germans began an immense bombardment as part of their last-gasp major offensive known as [[Operation Michael]] against British and [[Allies of World War I|Empire]] forces in the [[Picardy]] area. The 1st and 2nd Dublins suffered heavily from the intense bombardment (which included poison gas) and when the Germans attacked shortly afterwards, the Germans broke through the shattered remnants. The Germans made significant gains but their offensive gradually lost momentum and the Germans were pushed back by April. During that month, on 14 April, the 1st and 2nd Dublins had to briefly amalgamate due to the losses it had sustained during the German offensive, forming the 1st/2nd Dublins. The 1st Battalion was reconstituted a few days later with drafts from the 2nd Battalion, which was reduced to [[Cadre (military)|cadre]] strength.<ref name=trail/> On 26 April the 1st Dublins left the 16th (Irish) and rejoined the 86th Brigade, 29th Division. In June the 2nd Dublins transferred to the [[31st Division (United Kingdom)|31st Division]] and was reconstituted.<ref name=trail/> It was transferred to the Lines of Communication (LoC) before moving to [[50th (Northumbrian) Division|50th Division]] in July. In August the Allies launched their counter-offensive against the Germans and eventually reached the Hindenburg Line. The Allies launched their offensive against the Line in September, and the 1st, 2nd, and 7th Dublins, took part in the battles of the [[Second Battle of the Somme (1918)|St Quentin Canal]], [[Battle of Cambrai (1918)|Cambrai]] and [[Battle of Beaurevoir|Beaurevoir]], and the Hindenburg Line was successfully breached by the Allies. The Dublins took part in the last offensives of the war, taking part in, among others, the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Fourth Battle of Ypres]], [[Battle of Courtrai (1918)|Battle of Courtrai]] and the [[Battle of the Selle]] during September and October.

The Dublins landed at Suvla on 7 August; a day after the first landings there had taken place. Unlike at V Beach at Helles, Suvla was barely defended but incompetence at the higher echelons of command led to the British troops not exploiting their early advantage, ensuring that the Suvla landings became static and allowing the Turks to reinforce their defences. The Dublins took part in the effort to capture a position known as Chocolate Hill (7\u20138 August),<ref name=igws/> which was successfully taken, though at a heavy cost.

The Dublins had suffered heavily, nearly all of the just over 1000 men of the 1st Dublins who had landed at Helles in April had been killed, wounded, experienced disease or were missing, but further carnage was to await them in France. The Dublin Fusiliers battalions that had seen service in Gallipoli had had a diverse composition, indeed D Company, 7th Dublins (known as the 'Dublin Pals' in much the same way as the [[Pals battalion]]s) had a number of professional [[rugby football|rugby]] players and most of the company had attended [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], including Professor of Law Lieutenant Earnest Julian who was mortally wounded at Chocolate Hill and died on board a [[hospital ship]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dublin-fusiliers.com/battaliions/7-batt/officers-7th-bn/officers-7th-bat.html|title=Officers 7th Battalion, Royal Dublin Fusiliers|publisher=Dublin Fusiliers|accessdate=17 July 2016}}</ref> gaining the company the nickname 'The [[Toff]]s' which was in reference to the 2nd Dublins nickname, 'The Old Toughs'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/yourplaceandmine/topics/war/gunnings.shtml|title=The Gunning family|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the 6th and 7th Dublins had landed in [[Thessaloniki|Salonika]] in October 1915<ref name=trail/> as part of a British-French force requested by the Prime Minister of [[Greece]], with the intention of assisting [[Serbia]] who had been invaded by [[Bulgaria]], one of Germany's allies during the [[Macedonian front (World War I)|Macedonian campaign]].

The Dublins took part in the [[Battle of Kosturino]] (7\u20138 December)<ref name=igws/> and in the British withdrawal from Serbia. After Kosturino, things were mostly quiet, though the British still suffered casualties from disease, such as [[dysentery]] and [[malaria]], and also suffered from [[frostbite]].
