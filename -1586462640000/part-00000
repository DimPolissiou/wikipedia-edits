A staunch [[anti-communist]], Thanom oversaw a decade of military rule in Thailand from 1963 to 1973, during which he staged a [[1971 Thai coup d'etat|self-coup]], until public protests which exploded into violence forced him to step down.  His return from exile in 1976 sparked protests which led to a [[Thammasat University massacre|massacre of demonstrators]], followed by a [[1976 Thai coup d'etat|military coup]].\n\n==Early life==\nThanom Kittikachorn was born in Tak Province to [[Thai royal and noble titles#Khun|Khun]] (\u0e02\u0e38\u0e19) Sopitbannaraksa (Amphan Kittikachorn) and his wife, Mrs Linchee Kittikachorn. His family was of [[Thai-Chinese]] descent. He attended Wat Koak Plu Municipal School, then was admitted to the Army Cadet Academy. After receiving his commission, he reported for duty with Infantry Regiment VII in [[Chiang Mai]]. Thanom later studied at the Cartography School and the Infantry School, and graduated from the National Defense College in its first class.\n\n==Rise to power==\nAfter serving in the [[Shan States]] of Burma during [[World War II]], then Lieutenant Colonel Thanom took part in a successful 1947 coup headed by Colonel [[Sarit Thanarat]]. He became a regimental commander and was head of the [[Lopburi]] military department. He was soon promoted to colonel, commanding the 11th Infantry Division. Thanom was appointed a [[member of parliament]] in 1951, his first political role. He was promoted to major general the same year.\n\nIn February 1953, Thanom led the suppression of a rebellion against military rule, and was rewarded with promotion to lieutenant general. He represented Thailand at the ceremony to mark the end of the [[Korean War]] in July 1953 and was later promoted as commander of the 1st Region Army.\n\nHe was appointed deputy cooperatives minister in 1955. Thanom supported Sarit in his coup against the government of Field Marshal [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]], and was subsequently appointed defence minister in [[Pote Sarasin]]'s puppet regime in 1957. Thanom consolidated his power base as the second military leader and right-hand man of Sarit. A few days after the [[December 1957 Thai general election|December 1957 general election]], in which the pro-government [[Sahaphum Party]] (\"United Land\") had performed disappointingly, Thanom co-founded the [[National Socialist Party (Thailand)|National Socialist Party]] ''(Chat Sangkhomniyom)''. He became the deputy leader of this party, designed to extend the pro-government camp and win over former members of Phibunsongkhram's [[Seri Manangkhasila Party]] who had been reelected to parliament as independents.<ref>{{Citation |author=Thak Chaloemtiarana |title=Thailand: The Politics of Despotic Paternalism |year=2007 |place=Ithaca NY |publisher=Cornell Southeast Asia Program |page=88 |isbn=978-0-8772-7742-2}}</ref>\n\nIn 1958, he was made a full general and assumed the offices of prime minister and defence minister. He was prime minister for nine months, after which he was replaced by Sarit himself and made deputy prime minister, defence minister, and armed forces deputy supreme commander.\n\n==Prime minister==\n[[File:Thanom Kittikachorn 1960 01.jpg|thumb|left|Thanom Kittikachorn in 1960]]\nThanom was appointed prime minister one day after Sarit's death in 1963. He subsequently appointed himself commander-in-chief of the army. One year later, he promoted himself to the concurrent ranks of field marshal, [[Admiral of the fleet (Thailand)|admiral of the fleet]], and [[Marshal of the Royal Thai Air Force]]. Thanom continued the pro-[[United States|American]] and [[anti-Communism|anti-communist]] politics of his predecessor, which helped to ensure massive US economic and financial aid during the [[Vietnam War]]. Although he was personally popular, his regime was known for massive corruption. He established and led the [[United Thai People's Party]] ''(Saha Prachathai)'' in October 1968.\n\nThanom reappointed himself prime minister in February 1969 after general elections had been completed. The following year saw the beginnings of the [[1970s peasant revolts in Thailand]]. Then, in November 1971, he staged a [[1971 Thai coup d'etat|coup against his own government]], citing the need to suppress communist infiltration. He dissolved parliament and appointed himself Chairman of the [[National Executive Council]], and served as a caretaker government for one year. In December 1972, he appointed himself prime minister for a fourth time, also serving as the defence and foreign ministers. Thanom, his son Colonel [[Narong Kittikachorn|Narong]], and Narong's father-in-law General [[Praphas Charusathien]] became known as the \"three tyrants\".\n\nPublic discontent grew, along with demands for a general election to choose a new parliament. Student-led demands for a return to constitutional government, the so-called \"[[1973 Thai popular uprising|14 October 1973 uprising]]\", led to three days of violence followed by the sudden downfall of his government. Thanom and the other \"tyrants\" flew to exile in the [[United States]] and [[Singapore]]. Thanom's departure was followed by a restoration of a democratic rule in Thailand.\n\n==After Thammasat University massacre==\n{{Main|Thammasat University massacre}}\n[[File:\u0e27\u0e31\u0e19\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e43\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e35\u0e15 \u0e51\u0e51 \u0e40\u0e21\u0e29\u0e32\u0e22\u0e19 \u0e52\u0e55\u0e50\u0e59 \u0e08\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e16\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e21 \u0e01\u0e34\u0e15\u0e15\u0e34\u0e02\u0e08\u0e23 \u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e21\u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e13\u0e4c\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e4c.webm|thumb|Thanom in press conference]]\nIn October 1976, Thanom returned to Thailand in the robes of a novice monk,<ref>[http://bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/377651/in-the-book-of-exile-thaksin-pens-his-legacy In the book of exile, Thaksin pens his legacy]</ref> to stay at Bangkok's [[Wat Bowonniwet]]. Even though he announced he had no desire to enter politics, his return triggered student protests, which eventually moved onto the campus of [[Thammasat University]]. This was only a year after [[South Vietnam]] and Thailand's neighbors [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]] had fallen to the communists, and right-wing Thais suspected the protesters wished the same fate for their own country. On 6 October 1976, right-wing militants, aided by government security forces, stormed the Thammasat campus, violently broke up the protests, and [[6 October 1976 Massacre|killed many protesters]]. That evening, the military seized power from the elected civilian government of Democrat MR [[Seni Pramoj]] and installed hard-line royalist [[Thanin Kraivichien]] as premier.\n\nThanom soon left the monkhood, but he kept his word never to take part in politics again. Late in his life, he attempted to rehabilitate his tarnished image and recover properties seized when his government was overthrown.\n\nIn March 1999, Thanom was nominated to be a member of the honorary [[Royal Guards (Thailand)|Royal Guard]] by Prime Minister [[Chuan Leekpai]], which led to controversy. Thanom settled the matter himself by turning down the appointment.\n\nThanom Kittikachorn died in 2004 the age of 92 in [[Bangkok General Hospital]], after suffering a stroke and a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] two years earlier. His family's medical expenses were paid by King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]], which some saw as payback for Thanom's agreeing to the king's request that he leave the country to end the violence in 1973. Thanom's cremation was held on 25 February 2007 at Wat Debsirin. Queen [[Sirikit]] presided over the cremation ceremony, lighting the royal flame on behalf of King [[Bhumibol]]. Her youngest daughter, the Princess [[Chulabhorn Walailak|Chulabhorn]], also presided. Thanom's wife died in 2012 aged 98.\n\n==Honours==\nThanom received the following royal decorations in the [[Thai Honours Order of Precedence|Honours System]] of Thailand:<ref>[http://www.rta.mi.th/command/command17.htm Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120918144958/http://www.rta.mi.th/command/command17.htm |date=18 September 2012 }}, Royal Thai Army website (in Thai).

A staunch [[anti-communist]], Thanom oversaw a decade of military rule in Thailand from 1963 to 1973, during which he staged a [[1971 Thai coup d'etat|self-coup]], until public protests which exploded into violence forced him to step down.  His return from exile in 1976 sparked protests which led to a [[Thammasat University massacre|massacre of demonstrators]], followed by a [[1976 Thai coup d'etat|military coup]].\n\n==Early life==\nThanom Kittikachorn was born in Tak Province to [[Thai royal and noble titles#Khun|Khun]] (\u0e02\u0e38\u0e19) Sopitbannaraksa (Amphan Kittikachorn) and his wife, Mrs Linchee Kittikachorn. His family was of [[Thai-Chinese]] descent. He attended Wat Koak Plu Municipal School, then was admitted to the Army Cadet Academy. After receiving his commission, he reported for duty with Infantry Regiment VII in [[Chiang Mai]]. Thanom later studied at the Cartography School and the Infantry School, and graduated from the National Defense College in its first class.\n\n==Rise to power==\nAfter serving in the [[Shan States]] of Burma during [[World War II]], then Lieutenant Colonel Thanom took part in a successful 1947 coup headed by Colonel [[Sarit Thanarat]]. He became a regimental commander and was head of the [[Lopburi]] military department. He was soon promoted to colonel, commanding the 11th Infantry Division. Thanom was appointed a [[member of parliament]] in 1951, his first political role. He was promoted to major general the same year.\n\nIn February 1953, Thanom led the suppression of a rebellion against military rule, and was rewarded with promotion to lieutenant general. He represented Thailand at the ceremony to mark the end of the [[Korean War]] in July 1953 and was later promoted as commander of the 1st Region Army.\n\nHe was appointed deputy cooperatives minister in 1955. Thanom supported Sarit in his coup against the government of Field Marshal [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]], and was subsequently appointed defence minister in [[Pote Sarasin]]'s puppet regime in 1957. Thanom consolidated his power base as the second military leader and right-hand man of Sarit. A few days after the [[December 1957 Thai general election|December 1957 general election]], in which the pro-government [[Sahaphum Party]] (\"United Land\") had performed disappointingly, Thanom co-founded the [[National Socialist Party (Thailand)|National Socialist Party]] ''(Chat Sangkhomniyom)''. He became the deputy leader of this party, designed to extend the pro-government camp and win over former members of Phibunsongkhram's [[Seri Manangkhasila Party]] who had been reelected to parliament as independents.<ref>{{Citation |author=Thak Chaloemtiarana |title=Thailand: The Politics of Despotic Paternalism |year=2007 |place=Ithaca NY |publisher=Cornell Southeast Asia Program |page=88 |isbn=978-0-8772-7742-2}}</ref>\n\nIn 1958, he was made a full general and assumed the offices of prime minister and defence minister. He was prime minister for nine months, after which he was replaced by Sarit himself and made deputy prime minister, defence minister, and armed forces deputy supreme commander.\n\n==Prime minister==\n[[File:Thanom Kittikachorn 1960 01.jpg|thumb|left|Thanom Kittikachorn in 1960]]\nThanom was appointed prime minister one day after Sarit's death in 1963. He subsequently appointed himself commander-in-chief of the army. One year later, he promoted himself to the concurrent ranks of field marshal, [[Admiral of the fleet (Thailand)|admiral of the fleet]], and [[Marshal of the Royal Thai Air Force]]. Thanom continued the pro-[[United States|American]] and [[anti-Communism|anti-communist]] politics of his predecessor, which helped to ensure massive US economic and financial aid during the [[Vietnam War]]. Although he was personally popular, his regime was known for massive corruption. He established and led the [[United Thai People's Party]] ''(Saha Prachathai)'' in October 1968.\n\nThanom reappointed himself prime minister in February 1969 after general elections had been completed. The following year saw the beginnings of the [[1970s peasant revolts in Thailand]]. Then, in November 1971, he staged a [[1971 Thai coup d'etat|coup against his own government]], citing the need to suppress communist infiltration. He dissolved parliament and appointed himself Chairman of the [[National Executive Council]], and served as a caretaker government for one year. In December 1972, he appointed himself prime minister for a fourth time, also serving as the defence and foreign ministers. Thanom, his son Colonel [[Narong Kittikachorn|Narong]], and Narong's father-in-law General [[Praphas Charusathien]] became known as the \"three tyrants\".\n\nPublic discontent grew, along with demands for a general election to choose a new parliament. Student-led demands for a return to constitutional government, the so-called \"[[1973 Thai popular uprising|14 October 1973 uprising]]\", led to three days of violence followed by the sudden downfall of his government. Thanom and the other \"tyrants\" flew to exile in the [[United States]] and [[Singapore]]. Thanom's departure was followed by a restoration of a democratic rule in Thailand.\n\n==After Thammasat University massacre==\n{{Main|Thammasat University massacre}}\n[[File:\u0e27\u0e31\u0e19\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e43\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e35\u0e15 \u0e51\u0e51 \u0e40\u0e21\u0e29\u0e32\u0e22\u0e19 \u0e52\u0e55\u0e50\u0e59 \u0e08\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e16\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e21 \u0e01\u0e34\u0e15\u0e15\u0e34\u0e02\u0e08\u0e23 \u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e21\u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e13\u0e4c\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e4c.webm|thumb|Thanom in press conference]]\nIn October 1976, Thanom returned to Thailand in the robes of a novice monk,<ref>[http://bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/377651/in-the-book-of-exile-thaksin-pens-his-legacy In the book of exile, Thaksin pens his legacy]</ref> to stay at Bangkok's [[Wat Bowonniwet]]. Even though he announced he had no desire to enter politics, his return triggered student protests, which eventually moved onto the campus of [[Thammasat University]]. This was only a year after [[South Vietnam]] and Thailand's neighbors [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]] had fallen to the communists, and right-wing Thais suspected the protesters wished the same fate for their own country. On 6 October 1976, right-wing militants, aided by government security forces, stormed the Thammasat campus, violently broke up the protests, and [[6 October 1976 Massacre|killed many protesters]]. That evening, the military seized power from the elected civilian government of Democrat MR [[Seni Pramoj]] and installed hard-line royalist [[Thanin Kraivichien]] as premier.\n\nThanom soon left the monkhood, but he kept his word never to take part in politics again. Late in his life, he attempted to rehabilitate his tarnished image and recover properties seized when his government was overthrown.\n\nIn March 1999, Thanom was nominated to be a member of the honorary [[Royal Guards (Thailand)|Royal Guard]] by Prime Minister [[Chuan Leekpai]], which led to controversy. Thanom settled the matter himself by turning down the appointment.\n\nThanom Kittikachorn died in 2004 the age of 92 in [[Bangkok General Hospital]], after suffering a stroke and a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] two years earlier. His family's medical expenses were paid by King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]], which some saw as payback for Thanom's agreeing to the king's request that he leave the country to end the violence in 1973. Thanom's cremation was held on 25 February 2007 at Wat Debsirin. Queen [[Sirikit]] presided over the cremation ceremony, lighting the royal flame on behalf of King [[Bhumibol]]. Her youngest daughter, the Princess [[Chulabhorn Walailak|Chulabhorn]], also presided. Thanom's wife died in 2012 aged 98.\n\n==Honours==\nThanom received the following royal decorations in the [[Thai Honours Order of Precedence|Honours System]] of Thailand:<ref>[http://www.rta.mi.th/command/command17.htm Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120918144958/http://www.rta.mi.th/command/command17.htm |date=18 September 2012 }}, Royal Thai Army website (in Thai).

A sneeze expels air forcibly from the mouth and nose in an explosive, spasmodic involuntary action resulting chiefly from irritation of the nasal mucous membrane. This action allows for mucus to escape through the nasal cavity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sneeze|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sneeze|accessdate=April 6, 2012}}</ref> Sneezing is possibly linked to [[Photic sneeze reflex|sudden exposure to bright light]], sudden change (fall) in temperature, breeze of cold air, [[snatiation|a particularly full stomach]], or viral infection. Because sneezes can spread disease through infectious [[aerosol]] droplets, it is recommended to cover one's mouth and nose with the forearm, the inside of the elbow, a tissue or a handkerchief while sneezing.\n\nThe function of sneezing is to expel mucus containing foreign particles or irritants and cleanse the nasal cavity. During a sneeze, the [[soft palate]] and [[palatine uvula]] depress while the back of the tongue elevates to partially close the passage to the mouth so that air ejected from the lungs may be expelled through the nose. Because the closing of the mouth is partial, a considerable amount of this air is usually also expelled from the mouth. The force and extent of the expulsion of the air through the nose varies.\n\nSneezing cannot occur during sleep due to [[REM atonia]] \u2013 a bodily state where motor neurons are not stimulated and reflex signals are not relayed to the brain. Sufficient external stimulants, however, may cause a person to wake from sleep to sneeze, but any sneezing occurring afterwards would take place with a partially awake status at minimum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/sleep-on-sneeze-not|title=Sleep On, Sneeze Not : A Moment of Science|accessdate=2019-02-21}}</ref>\n[[File:Qualitative-Real-Time-Schlieren-and-Shadowgraph-Imaging-of-Human-Exhaled-Airflows-An-Aid-to-Aerosol-pone.0021392.s002.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=0:12|360px|[[Shadowgraph]] visualization of the airflow during a sneeze, comparing an unmasked sneeze with several different method of covering one's mouth and nose: sneezing into a fist, a cupped hand, a tissue, a \"coughcatcher\" device, a [[surgical mask]], and an [[N95 mask]]]]\n\n== Description ==\n{{Listen\n|filename = sneeze.ogg\n|title = Sneeze\n|description =\n}}\nSneezing typically occurs when foreign particles or sufficient external stimulants pass through the nasal hairs to reach the nasal [[mucosa]]. This triggers the release of [[histamine]]s, which irritate the nerve cells in the nose, resulting in signals being sent to the [[brain]] to initiate the sneeze through the [[Trigeminal nerve|trigeminal nerve network]]. The brain then relates this initial signal, activates the [[Pharynx|pharyngeal]] and [[Vertebrate trachea|tracheal]] muscles and creates a large opening of the nasal and oral cavities, resulting in a powerful release of air and bioparticles. The powerful nature of a sneeze is attributed to its involvement of numerous organs of the upper body \u2013 it is a [[reflex]]ive response involving the face, throat, and chest muscles.\nSneezing is also triggered by sinus nerve stimulation caused by [[nasal congestion]] and [[allergies]].\n\nThe neural regions involved in the sneeze reflex are located in the [[brainstem]] along the ventromedial part of the [[spinal trigeminal nucleus]] and the adjacent pontine-medullary [[lateral reticular formation]]. This region appears to control the [[pharyngeal muscles|epipharyngeal]], intrinsic [[muscles of larynx|laryngeal]] and respiratory muscles, and the combined activity of these muscles serve as the basis for the generation of a sneeze.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Nonaka S, Unno T, Ohta Y, Mori S |title=Sneeze-evoking region within the brainstem |journal=Brain Res. |volume=511 |issue=2 |pages=265\u201370 |date=March 1990 |pmid=2139800 |doi=10.1016/0006-8993(90)90171-7}}</ref>\n\nThe sneeze reflex involves contraction of a number of different muscles and muscle groups throughout the body, typically including the eyelids.

In 401 BC, for instance, the [[Athens|Athenian]] general [[Xenophon]] gave a speech exhorting his fellow soldiers to fight against the [[Persian Empire|Persians]]. A [[soldier]] underscored his conclusion with a sneeze. Thinking that this sneeze was a favorable sign from the gods, the soldiers were impressed.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Xenophon]]|title=Anabasis|at=Book 3, chapter 2, paragraph 9|title-link=Anabasis (Xenophon)}}</ref> Another divine moment of sneezing for the Greeks occurs in the story of [[Odysseus]]. His waiting wife [[Penelope]], hearing [[Odysseus]] may be alive, says that he and his son would take revenge on the suitors if he were to return. At that moment, their son sneezes loudly and Penelope laughs with joy, reassured that it is a sign from the [[Greek Gods|gods]] ([[Odyssey]] 17: 541-550). It may be because this belief survived through the centuries, that in certain parts of Greece today, when someone is asserting something and the listener sneezes promptly at the end of the assertion, the former responds \"bless you and I am speaking the truth\", or \"bless you and here is the truth\", \"\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b9 \u03b1\u03bb\u03ae\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bb\u03ad\u03c9\", ''ya sou ki alithia leo'', or \"\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03b1\u03bb\u03ae\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\", ''ya sou ke na ki i alithia'').

This connection, coupled with the significant amount of breath expelled from the body during a sneeze, had likely led people to believe that sneezing could easily be fatal.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Such a theory could explain the reasoning behind the traditional English phrase, \"God bless you\", in response to a sneeze, the origins of which are not entirely clear (see \"Traditional Responses To A Sneeze\" below for alternative explanations). Sir [[Raymond Henry Payne Crawfurd]], for instance, the registrar of the [[Royal College of Physicians]], in his 1909 book, \"The Last Days of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]\", states that, when the controversial monarch was on his deathbed, his medical attendants administered a concoction of [[Primula veris|cowslips]] and extract of [[Caltha palustris|ammonia]] to promote sneezing.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wylie A | title = Rhinology and laryngology in literature and Folk-Lore | journal = The Journal of Laryngology & Otology | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 81\u201387 | year = 1927 | doi=10.1017/S0022215100029959}}</ref> However, it is not known if this promotion of sneezing was done to hasten his death (as ''[[coup de gr\u00e2ce]]'') or as an ultimate attempt at treatment.\n\nIn certain parts of [[Eastern Asia]], particularly in [[Chinese culture]], [[Korean culture]], [[Japanese culture]] and [[Vietnamese culture]], a sneeze without an obvious cause was generally perceived as a sign that someone was talking about the sneezer at that very moment. This can be seen in the ''[[Book of Songs (Chinese)|Book of Songs]]'' (a collection of Chinese poems)<ref>\u300a\u8a69\u7d93\u00b7\u7d42\u98a8\u300b \u300c\u5be4\u8a00\u4e0d\u5bd0\uff0c\u9858\u8a00\u5247\u568f\u300d</ref> in ancient China as early as 1000 BC, and in Japan this belief is still depicted in present-day [[manga]] and [[anime]]. In [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[South Korea]], and [[Japan]], for instance, there is a [[superstition]] that if talking behind someone's back causes the person being talked about to sneeze; as such, the sneezer can tell if something good is being said (one sneeze), someone is thinking about you  (two sneezes in a row), even if someone is in love with you (three sneezes in a row) or if this is a sign that they are about to catch a [[Common cold|cold]] (multiple sneezes).\n\nParallel beliefs are known to exist around the world, particularly in contemporary Greek, Slavic, Celtic, English, French, and Indian cultures. Similarly, in [[Nepal]], sneezers are believed to be remembered by someone at that particular moment.\n\n==Culture==\nIn [[Culture of India|Indian culture]], especially in [[North India|northern parts of India]], Bengali (Bangladesh and Bengal of India) culture and also in [[Iran]], it has been a common superstition that a sneeze taking place before the start of any work was a sign of impending bad interruption. It was thus customary to pause in order to drink water or break any work rhythm before resuming the job at hand in order to prevent any misfortune from occurring.\n\nContrarily, in [[Culture of Poland|Polish culture]], especially in the [[Kresy]] Wschodnie borderlands, a popular belief persists that sneezes may be an inauspicious sign that one's mother-in-law speaks ill of their son-in-law at that moment. The same phenomenon is thought to correspond to daughters-in-law and their mothers-in-law. As with other [[Catholic]] countries, such as Mexico, Italy, or Ireland, the remnants of pagan culture are fostered in Polish peasant idiosyncratic superstitions.\n\nThe practice among [[Muslim culture|Islamic culture]], in turn, has largely been based on various prophetic traditions and the teachings of the prophet [[Muhammad]]. An example of this is [[Al-Bukhaari]]'s<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://sunnah.com/bukhari/78/248 |title = Sunnah.com > Sahih Al Bukhari (126) Chapter: When somebody sneezes, what should be said?}}</ref> narrations from [[Abu Hurayrah]] that Muhammad once said:<blockquote>\n''When one of you sneezes, let him say, \"Al-hamdu-Lillah\"'' (Praise be to [[God]])'', and let his brother or companion say to him, \"Yarhamuk Allah\"'' (May God have mercy on you)''. If he says, \"Yarhamuk-Allah\", then let [the sneezer] say, \"Yahdeekum Allah wa yuslihu baalakum\"'' (May God guide you and rectify your condition)''.''\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Verbal responses ===\n{{Main|Response to sneezing}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}\n\nIn [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, one common verbal response to another person's sneeze is \"[May God] bless you\". \nAnother common verbal response to another's sneeze is \"Gesundheit\", which is a German word that means, appropriately, \"good health\".\n\nSeveral hypotheses exist for why the custom arose of saying \"bless you\" or \"God bless you\" in the context of sneezing:\n* Some say it came into use during the [[black death|plague]] pandemics of the 14th century.  Blessing the individual after showing such a symptom was thought to prevent possible impending death due to the lethal disease.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/sneeze.html |title = Does your heart stop when you sneeze? (Everyday Mysteries: Fun Science Facts from the Library of Congress)}}</ref>\n* In Renaissance times, a superstition was formed claiming one's heart stopped for a very brief moment during the sneeze; saying bless you was a sign of prayer that the heart would not fail.\n* It has also been stated that one says \"(God) bless you\" so that one does not catch the flu, cold, or any other forms of sickness.\n\nOther cultures have similar traditions:\n* In China, after a person sneezes they often say \"\u767e\u5c81\uff01\" which translates to \" may you live one hundred years!\" the pronunciation is surprisingly like \"bless you\" in English. pronunciation: [Bai Sui]\n* In Muslim countries, after a person sneezes they often say {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0644\u0644\u0647}} ''Al-\u1e25amdu lill\u0101h'' (Arabic) is an Arabic phrase meaning \"Praise to God\".  His/her companion should say to he/she Yarhamuk-Allah \"May Allah have mercy on you.\" The sneezing person should say Yahdikum-ullah wa yuslihu balakum \"May Allah guide you and render sound your state of affairs.\" <ref>{{Cite web | url=https://sunnah.com/bukhari/78/248 |title = Sunnah.com > Sahih Al Bukhari (126) Chapter: When somebody sneezes, what should be said?}}</ref> narrated from [[Abu Hurayrah]] in [[Sahih Al Bukhari]]\n* In Iran, it is common to respond to sneezing with the [[Persian language|Persian]] phrase {{lang|fa|\u0639\u0627\u0641\u06cc\u062a \u0628\u0627\u0634\u0647}} ''\u00e2fiyat b\u00e2\u0161e'', which translates to \"health\", similar to common European expressions.\n* Indian culture is to respond with Krishna, similar to a blessing in western cultures.\n* In Italy after a person sneezes the people present respond with the word \u201csalute\u201d (meaning: health). The louder the sneeze the more emphatic the response. \n* In Slovakia, after a person sneezes, it is proper to say \"Na zdravie!\" which means \"For health!\"; a proper response should be \"\u010eakujem\" which means \"Thanks\". This is also the case in Finland where \"terveydeksi\" means \"for health\". Likewise in Russian, \"\u0431\u0443\u0434\u044c \u0437\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\" (bud' zdorov), translates as \"be healthy\".\n* In Tamil, a reciprocation to someone's sneeze is \"\u0b86\u0baf\u0bc1\u0b9a\u0bc1 \u0ba8\u0bc2\u0bb1\u0bc1\" (aa-yu-su noo-ru) or \"\u0b86\u0baf\u0bc1\u0bb3\u0bcd \u0ba8\u0bc2\u0bb1\u0bc1\" (aa-yul noo-ru) which, in direct translation, means \"100 years-long life\". It is a particularly endearing expression often used by elderly when a young child sneezes, wishing upon them good health, as a sort of blessing. Some may say \"Dheergaiyish\", meaning \"may you live long\", but that is more closely related to Sanskrit.\n*In Turkey, after a person sneezes, it is proper to say \"\u00c7ok ya\u015fa\" which means \"Live long\"; a proper response should be \"Sen de g\u00f6r\" which means \"May you see too [that I lived long enough]\".\n*In Telugu, a reciprocation to someone's sneeze is \"chiranjeeva sataish\" (\u0c1a\u0c3f\u0c30\u0c66\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35) which means \"may you live long\" (from Sanskrit).\n* In Japanese and Chinese entertainment, such as anime or dramas, a character's sneeze usually means that someone is talking about the character.<ref>{{cite web |last1=BITMOB |title=The Inside Scoop on Localizing Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story |url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/09/14/qaa-nintendo-senior-localization-manager-nate-bihldorff/ |website=venturebeat |publisher=VentureBeat |accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Sexuality===\n[[File:Fred Ott Sneeze L.gif|thumb|The build-up and sudden release of a sneeze.]]\nSome people may [[Sexually induced sneezing|sneeze during the initial phases of sexual arousal]].

A sneeze expels air forcibly from the mouth and nose in an explosive, spasmodic involuntary action resulting chiefly from irritation of the nasal mucous membrane. This action allows for mucus to escape through the nasal cavity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sneeze|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sneeze|accessdate=April 6, 2012}}</ref> Sneezing is possibly linked to [[Photic sneeze reflex|sudden exposure to bright light]], sudden change (fall) in temperature, breeze of cold air, [[snatiation|a particularly full stomach]], or viral infection. Because sneezes can spread disease through infectious [[aerosol]] droplets, it is recommended to cover one's mouth and nose with the forearm, the inside of the elbow, a tissue or a handkerchief while sneezing.\n\nThe function of sneezing is to expel mucus containing foreign particles or irritants and cleanse the nasal cavity. During a sneeze, the [[soft palate]] and [[palatine uvula]] depress while the back of the tongue elevates to partially close the passage to the mouth so that air ejected from the lungs may be expelled through the nose. Because the closing of the mouth is partial, a considerable amount of this air is usually also expelled from the mouth. The force and extent of the expulsion of the air through the nose varies.\n\nSneezing cannot occur during sleep due to [[REM atonia]] \u2013 a bodily state where motor neurons are not stimulated and reflex signals are not relayed to the brain. Sufficient external stimulants, however, may cause a person to wake from sleep to sneeze, but any sneezing occurring afterwards would take place with a partially awake status at minimum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/sleep-on-sneeze-not|title=Sleep On, Sneeze Not : A Moment of Science|accessdate=2019-02-21}}</ref>\n[[File:Qualitative-Real-Time-Schlieren-and-Shadowgraph-Imaging-of-Human-Exhaled-Airflows-An-Aid-to-Aerosol-pone.0021392.s002.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=0:12|360px|[[Shadowgraph]] visualization of the airflow during a sneeze, comparing an unmasked sneeze with several different method of covering one's mouth and nose: sneezing into a fist, a cupped hand, a tissue, a \"coughcatcher\" device, a [[surgical mask]], and an [[N95 mask]]]]\n\n== Description ==\n{{Listen\n|filename = sneeze.ogg\n|title = Sneeze\n|description =\n}}\nSneezing typically occurs when foreign particles or sufficient external stimulants pass through the nasal hairs to reach the nasal [[mucosa]]. This triggers the release of [[histamine]]s, which irritate the nerve cells in the nose, resulting in signals being sent to the [[brain]] to initiate the sneeze through the [[Trigeminal nerve|trigeminal nerve network]]. The brain then relates this initial signal, activates the [[Pharynx|pharyngeal]] and [[Vertebrate trachea|tracheal]] muscles and creates a large opening of the nasal and oral cavities, resulting in a powerful release of air and bioparticles. The powerful nature of a sneeze is attributed to its involvement of numerous organs of the upper body \u2013 it is a [[reflex]]ive response involving the face, throat, and chest muscles.\nSneezing is also triggered by sinus nerve stimulation caused by [[nasal congestion]] and [[allergies]].\n\nThe neural regions involved in the sneeze reflex are located in the [[brainstem]] along the ventromedial part of the [[spinal trigeminal nucleus]] and the adjacent pontine-medullary [[lateral reticular formation]]. This region appears to control the [[pharyngeal muscles|epipharyngeal]], intrinsic [[muscles of larynx|laryngeal]] and respiratory muscles, and the combined activity of these muscles serve as the basis for the generation of a sneeze.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Nonaka S, Unno T, Ohta Y, Mori S |title=Sneeze-evoking region within the brainstem |journal=Brain Res. |volume=511 |issue=2 |pages=265\u201370 |date=March 1990 |pmid=2139800 |doi=10.1016/0006-8993(90)90171-7}}</ref>\n\nThe sneeze reflex involves contraction of a number of different muscles and muscle groups throughout the body, typically including the eyelids.

In 401 BC, for instance, the [[Athens|Athenian]] general [[Xenophon]] gave a speech exhorting his fellow soldiers to fight against the [[Persian Empire|Persians]]. A [[soldier]] underscored his conclusion with a sneeze. Thinking that this sneeze was a favorable sign from the gods, the soldiers were impressed.<ref>{{cite book|last1=[[Xenophon]]|title=Anabasis|at=Book 3, chapter 2, paragraph 9|title-link=Anabasis (Xenophon)}}</ref> Another divine moment of sneezing for the Greeks occurs in the story of [[Odysseus]]. His waiting wife [[Penelope]], hearing [[Odysseus]] may be alive, says that he and his son would take revenge on the suitors if he were to return. At that moment, their son sneezes loudly and Penelope laughs with joy, reassured that it is a sign from the [[Greek Gods|gods]] ([[Odyssey]] 17: 541-550). It may be because this belief survived through the centuries, that in certain parts of Greece today, when someone is asserting something and the listener sneezes promptly at the end of the assertion, the former responds \"bless you and I am speaking the truth\", or \"bless you and here is the truth\", \"\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b9 \u03b1\u03bb\u03ae\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bb\u03ad\u03c9\", ''ya sou ki alithia leo'', or \"\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03b1\u03bb\u03ae\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\", ''ya sou ke na ki i alithia'').

Sir [[Raymond Henry Payne Crawfurd]], for instance, the registrar of the [[Royal College of Physicians]], in his 1909 book, \"The Last Days of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]\", states that, when the controversial monarch was on his deathbed, his medical attendants administered a concoction of [[Primula veris|cowslips]] and extract of [[Caltha palustris|ammonia]] to promote sneezing.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wylie A | title = Rhinology and laryngology in literature and Folk-Lore | journal = The Journal of Laryngology & Otology | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 81\u201387 | year = 1927 | doi=10.1017/S0022215100029959}}</ref> However, it is not known if this promotion of sneezing was done to hasten his death (as ''[[coup de gr\u00e2ce]]'') or as an ultimate attempt at treatment.\n\nIn certain parts of [[Eastern Asia]], particularly in [[Chinese culture]], [[Korean culture]], [[Japanese culture]] and [[Vietnamese culture]], a sneeze without an obvious cause was generally perceived as a sign that someone was talking about the sneezer at that very moment. This can be seen in the ''[[Book of Songs (Chinese)|Book of Songs]]'' (a collection of Chinese poems)<ref>\u300a\u8a69\u7d93\u00b7\u7d42\u98a8\u300b \u300c\u5be4\u8a00\u4e0d\u5bd0\uff0c\u9858\u8a00\u5247\u568f\u300d</ref> in ancient China as early as 1000 BC, and in Japan this belief is still depicted in present-day [[manga]] and [[anime]]. In [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[South Korea]], and [[Japan]], for instance, there is a [[superstition]] that if talking behind someone's back causes the person being talked about to sneeze; as such, the sneezer can tell if something good is being said (one sneeze), someone is thinking about you  (two sneezes in a row), even if someone is in love with you (three sneezes in a row) or if this is a sign that they are about to catch a [[Common cold|cold]] (multiple sneezes).\n\nParallel beliefs are known to exist around the world, particularly in contemporary Greek, Slavic, Celtic, English, French, and Indian cultures. Similarly, in [[Nepal]], sneezers are believed to be remembered by someone at that particular moment.\n\n==Culture==\nIn [[Culture of India|Indian culture]], especially in [[North India|northern parts of India]], Bengali (Bangladesh and Bengal of India) culture and also in [[Iran]], it has been a common superstition that a sneeze taking place before the start of any work was a sign of impending bad interruption. It was thus customary to pause in order to drink water or break any work rhythm before resuming the job at hand in order to prevent any misfortune from occurring.\n\nContrarily, in [[Culture of Poland|Polish culture]], especially in the [[Kresy]] Wschodnie borderlands, a popular belief persists that sneezes may be an inauspicious sign that one's mother-in-law speaks ill of their son-in-law at that moment. The same phenomenon is thought to correspond to daughters-in-law and their mothers-in-law. As with other [[Catholic]] countries, such as Mexico, Italy, or Ireland, the remnants of pagan culture are fostered in Polish peasant idiosyncratic superstitions.\n\nThe practice among [[Muslim culture|Islamic culture]], in turn, has largely been based on various prophetic traditions and the teachings of the prophet [[Muhammad]]. An example of this is [[Al-Bukhaari]]'s<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://sunnah.com/bukhari/78/248 |title = Sunnah.com > Sahih Al Bukhari (126) Chapter: When somebody sneezes, what should be said?}}</ref> narrations from [[Abu Hurayrah]] that Muhammad once said:<blockquote>\n''When one of you sneezes, let him say, \"Al-hamdu-Lillah\"'' (Praise be to [[God]])'', and let his brother or companion say to him, \"Yarhamuk Allah\"'' (May God have mercy on you)''. If he says, \"Yarhamuk-Allah\", then let [the sneezer] say, \"Yahdeekum Allah wa yuslihu baalakum\"'' (May God guide you and rectify your condition)''.''\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Verbal responses ===\n{{Main|Response to sneezing}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}\n\nIn [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, one common verbal response to another person's sneeze is \"[May God] bless you\". \nAnother common verbal response to another's sneeze is \"Gesundheit\", which is a German word that means, appropriately, \"good health\".\n\nSeveral hypotheses exist for why the custom arose of saying \"bless you\" or \"God bless you\" in the context of sneezing:\n* Some say it came into use during the [[black death|plague]] pandemics of the 14th century.  Blessing the individual after showing such a symptom was thought to prevent possible impending death due to the lethal disease.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/sneeze.html |title = Does your heart stop when you sneeze? (Everyday Mysteries: Fun Science Facts from the Library of Congress)}}</ref>\n* In Renaissance times, a superstition was formed claiming one's heart stopped for a very brief moment during the sneeze; saying bless you was a sign of prayer that the heart would not fail.\n* It has also been stated that one says \"(God) bless you\" so that one does not catch the flu, cold, or any other forms of sickness.\n\nOther cultures have similar traditions:\n* In China, after a person sneezes they often say \"\u767e\u5c81\uff01\" which translates to \" may you live one hundred years!\" the pronunciation is surprisingly like \"bless you\" in English. pronunciation: [Bai Sui]\n* In Muslim countries, after a person sneezes they often say Al-\u1e25amdu lill\u0101h (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0644\u0644\u0647) is an Arabic phrase meaning \"Praise to God\".  His/her companion should say to he/she Yarhamuk-Allah \"May Allah have mercy on you.\" The sneezing person should say Yahdikum-ullah wa yuslihu balakum \"May Allah guide you and render sound your state of affairs.\" <ref>{{Cite web | url=https://sunnah.com/bukhari/78/248 |title = Sunnah.com > Sahih Al Bukhari (126) Chapter: When somebody sneezes, what should be said?}}</ref> narrated from [[Abu Hurayrah]] in [[Sahih Al Bukhari]]\n* In Iran, it is common to respond to sneezing with the [[Persian language|Persian]] phrase \"\u0639\u0627\u0641\u06cc\u062a \u0628\u0627\u0634\u0647\", which translates to \"health\", similar to common European expressions.\n* Indian culture is to respond with Krishna, similar to a blessing in western cultures.\n* In Italy after a person sneezes the people present respond with the word \u201csalute\u201d (meaning: health). The louder the sneeze the more emphatic the response. \n* In Slovakia, after a person sneezes, it is proper to say \"Na zdravie!\" which means \"For health!\"; a proper response should be \"\u010eakujem\" which means \"Thanks\". This is also the case in Finland where \"terveydeksi\" means \"for health\". Likewise in Russian, \"\u0431\u0443\u0434\u044c \u0437\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\" (bud' zdorov), translates as \"be healthy\".\n* In Tamil, a reciprocation to someone's sneeze is \"\u0b86\u0baf\u0bc1\u0b9a\u0bc1 \u0ba8\u0bc2\u0bb1\u0bc1\" (aa-yu-su noo-ru) or \"\u0b86\u0baf\u0bc1\u0bb3\u0bcd \u0ba8\u0bc2\u0bb1\u0bc1\" (aa-yul noo-ru) which, in direct translation, means \"100 years-long life\". It is a particularly endearing expression often used by elderly when a young child sneezes, wishing upon them good health, as a sort of blessing. Some may say \"Dheergaiyish\", meaning \"may you live long\", but that is more closely related to Sanskrit.\n*In Turkey, after a person sneezes, it is proper to say \"\u00c7ok ya\u015fa\" which means \"Live long\"; a proper response should be \"Sen de g\u00f6r\" which means \"May you see too [that I lived long enough]\".\n*In Telugu, a reciprocation to someone's sneeze is \"chiranjeeva sataish\" (\u0c1a\u0c3f\u0c30\u0c66\u0c1c\u0c40\u0c35) which means \"may you live long\" (from Sanskrit).\n* In Japanese and Chinese entertainment, such as anime or dramas, a character's sneeze usually means that someone is talking about the character.<ref>{{cite web |last1=BITMOB |title=The Inside Scoop on Localizing Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story |url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/09/14/qaa-nintendo-senior-localization-manager-nate-bihldorff/ |website=venturebeat |publisher=VentureBeat |accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Sexuality===\n[[File:Fred Ott Sneeze L.gif|thumb|The build-up and sudden release of a sneeze.]]\nSome people may [[Sexually induced sneezing|sneeze during the initial phases of sexual arousal]].
