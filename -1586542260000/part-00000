{"title_page": "Divorce in Francoist Spain and the democratic transition", "text_new": "{{Francoism sidebar}}'''Divorce in Francoist Spain and the democratic transition''' was illegal. While divorce had been legal during the [[Second Spanish Republic]],  Franco began to overturn these laws by March 1938. In 1945, the legislation embodied in his Fuero de los Espa\u00f1oles established that marriage was an indissoluble union.  Divorce was still possible in Spain through the Catholic Church as a result of [[Pauline privilege]] or [[Petrine privilege|''petrino'']].  Marriages, primarily for the rich, could also be annulled through [[Ecclesiastical court|ecclesiastical tribunals]]. The Catholic Church was vigorously opposed divorces, whether on religious or civil grounds.\n\nThe relationship between Spanish marriage and Catholic Canonical Law would fundamentally change following the death of Franco with the creation of the [[Constitution of Spain|1978 Spanish constitution]].\u00a0 This came about because of the demands of the Spanish left, which finally gained representation after a long wait as a consequence of the 1977 Spanish general elections.\u00a0 The left had run on a platform of supporting divorce.\u00a0 Compromises were required so that canonical law could no longer dictate the country's marriage laws.\u00a0 Because of divisions in the Government, the issue of the legalization of divorce itself was delayed until 1981.\u00a0 That year, the divorce law passed, becoming official on 7 July 1981.\u00a0 To appease the Church, the process was designed to make it difficult for a divorce to be granted.\u00a0 The first divorce was granted to [[Julia Ibars]] on 7 September 1981 in [[Santander, Spain|Santander]].\u00a0 Express divorce would be many years off.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Francoist period (1939 - 1975) ===\n{{See also|Francoist Spain}}\nThe concept of civil marriage did not form part of Spanish law until 18 June 1870.\u00a0 Prior to this, all marriages in the country were religious ones, established under law with [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]'s July 1564 Royal Decree, based on the [[Council of Trent]].<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite news|url=https://elderecho.com/la-evolucion-historica-de-las-formas-de-extincion-del-vinculo-matrimonial|title=En este art\u00edculo se analizan las normas que han regulado las formas de extinci\u00f3n del matrimonio|work=El Derecho|access-date=2019-04-05|language=es-ES}}</ref>  In March 1938, Franco suppressed the laws regarding civil matrimony and divorce that had been enacted by the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]].<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-jBpAAAAMAAJ|title=Defying male civilization: women in the Spanish Civil War|last=Nash|first=Mary|date=1995|publisher=Arden Press|isbn=9780912869155|language=en}}</ref>  On 2 March 1938, Franco declared that in all Nationalist territories lawsuits seeking legal separation or divorce were to be suspended.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://lacabezallena.com/historia/divorcio-republicano/|title=\u00bfQu\u00e9 pas\u00f3 con los matrimonios que se hab\u00edan divorciado durante la Rep\u00fablica? \u2013 La cabeza llena|language=es|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref> On 22 April 1939, an order was made that all canonical marriages carried out by the Republic be registered as such with the Francoist government.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nFranco repealed the 1932 Divorce Law of the Second Republic on 23 September 1939.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lavanguardia.com/hemeroteca/20170228/42353048137/divorcio-legislacion-espana-historia.html|title=Divorcio made in Spain: un derecho con 85 a\u00f1os de historia|date=2017-09-14|website=La Vanguardia|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://canalhistoria.es/hoy-en-la-historia/se-aprueba-la-ley-del-divorcio/|title=Se aprueba la Ley del Divorcio|date=2012-06-21|website=Historia|language=es-ES|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref><ref name=\":13\" /> The 23 September 1939 law provided that in cases when women requested and received divorces as a result of allegations of mistreatment, the husband could force the wife to remarry.\u00a0 In all cases, the divorce request would automatically be annulled if one party asked for the marriage to be reconstituted.\u00a0 They had to only state a \"desire to reconstitute their legitimate home, or simply, to reassure their conscience as believers\".

Marriages could also be nullified if one spouse was baptized and the other not, as the Catholic spouse could not live as a faithful Catholic because of their spouse's lack of faith. \nAs a result, the Catholic spouse could remarry another Catholic with whom they could live peacefully.\u00a0 Another way a Catholic divorce could occur was known as [[Petrine privilege|''petrino'']], a similar formula created by Pope Pius XI.\u00a0 A divorce could be granted if the married coupled included a Catholic and non-Catholic spouse, where the Catholic spouse wanted the separation in order to marry a Catholic.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/diario/1980/11/11/espana/342745203_850215.html|title=Tribuna {{!}} La verdadera historia del divorcio|last=Pa\u00eds|first=Ediciones El|date=1980-11-11|work=El Pa\u00eds|access-date=2019-04-04|language=es|issn=1134-6582}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gacetadelosmiserables.com/2018/05/31/las-mujeres-durante-el-franquismo/|title=Las mujeres durante el Franquismo|last=Gacetadelosmiserables|date=2018-05-31|website=La Gaceta de los Miserables.|language=es-ES|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref>\n\nDivorce in the late Franco period and early transition was available via ecclesiastical tribunals.\u00a0 These courts could nullify marriage for a fee.\u00a0 Consequently, they were mostly available only to the rich, the most famous instance of this nullification involving\u00a0[[Isabel Presley]] and [[Carmencita Mart\u00ednez Bordi\u00fa]].<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mujeresenred.net/spip.php?article447|title=El Movimiento feminista en Salamanca despu\u00e9s de la muerte de Franco|last=D\u00edez Balda|first=M\u00aa Antonia|website=mujeres en red|publisher=Universidad de Salamanca|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref> The Civil Courts were only involved in separation procedures at the provisional level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lavanguardia.com/cultura/20170511/422451734834/adulteras-espana-ultimas-delito-ley.html|title=Las dos \u00faltimas ad\u00falteras de Espa\u00f1a|date=2017-05-10|website=La Vanguardia|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref> The Catholic Church was actively opposed to civil divorce in the mid and late 1970s.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Democratic transition period (1975\u20141982) ===\n{{See also|Spanish democratic transition}}\nFor many people in Spain, the period that marked the start of Spain's transition to democracy began on 20 December 1973 with the death of Luis Carrero Blanco as a result of an attack by ETA.<ref name=\":42\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mujeresenred.net/spip.php?article447|title=El Movimiento feminista en Salamanca despu\u00e9s de la muerte de Franco|last=D\u00edez Balda|first=M\u00aa Antonia|website=mujeres en red|publisher=Universidad de Salamanca|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref> The end of the transition period is generally considered to be 1982, with the elections that saw the [[PSOE]] come to power.<ref name=\":42\" /> Franco died in November 1975.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KoHC6Oi-SGkC|title=Spanish Women's Writing 1849-1996|last=Davies|first=Catherine|date=1998-01-01|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=9780485910063|language=en}}</ref> Ahead of the first democratic elections, in 1977 following Franco's death, Spaniards overwhelmingly supported the legalizing of divorce.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lavanguardia.com/hemeroteca/20110810/54194680524/primeras-demandas-de-divorcio.html|title=Primeras demandas de divorcio|date=2011-08-09|website=La Vanguardia|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref> Catholic canonical law, which applied in Francoist Spain and during the democratic transition, did not end until the Spanish constitution was adopted in 1978.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nAs a European Christian Democratic party, the [[Union of the Democratic Centre (Spain)|UCD]] opposed the legalization of divorce, believing in what they saw as \"the preservation of the family\".

The last time the state had been in conflict with the Church was in 1931, with the founding of the Second Republic and no one wanted to see renewed political violence.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 22 May 1978, four UCD deputies and four Socialist deputies met at a restaurant in Madrid to try to find a compromise on major issues as they were addressed in the constitution. These issues included divorce and abortion.\u00a0The UCD deputies went into the meeting having consulted their PCE and Catalan counterparts. All agreed this was a necessary step to avoid a breakdown in the process of writing a new constitution. Allianz Popular was left out of the discussions.<ref name=\":0\" /> One of the reasons UCD went into decline after the 1977 elections was that the party was forced to take positions on major issues of the day, including divorce, abortion and the use of public money for private schools.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the first draft of the constitution, both PSOE and PCE supported the legalization of abortion and divorce. UCD supported the legalization of divorce, but only at a later date. UCD opposed the legalization of abortion. [[Coalici\u00f3n Popular]] opposed both the legalization of abortion and divorce. A compromise was reached on divorce that would see the issue addressed in later legislation through the text of Article 32.2 which stated, \"The law will regulate the forms of matrimony\u2026 [and] the causes of separation and dissolution.\"\u00a0No agreement could be reached over abortion, and Article 15 had the ambiguous text \"todos tienan derecho a la vida\" (all have the right to life) at the insistence of UCD and Coalici\u00f3n Popular so the door could be left open to make abortion illegal.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=k4sgEOcbKbUC|title=Symbol and Ritual in the New Spain: The Transition to Democracy After Franco|last=Edles|first=Laura Desfor|date=1998-04-16|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521628853|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe November 1979 XXXII Conferencia Episcopal advised that the Church did not want to interfere in the ability of legislators to conduct their business. Nonetheless, they stated that legislators considering legalization of divorce should be allowed to do so only in specific circumstances.\u00a0These included that divorce was not a right, mutual consent could not be allowed, and divorce should only occur when there was no other remedy for the marriage. The Ministry of Justice asked the Catholic Church to stop meddling, and the Catholic Church had to accept that they would not have any involvement in civil marriages and civil divorces. Monsignor Jubany from Barcelona made a final request in meeting with members of the Cortes, namely that divorce should be rendered costly as a means of prevention.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nMinister of Justice Francisco Fern\u00e1ndez successfully fought the inclusion of a hardness clause in divorce legislation. The clause would have allowed judges to prevent a divorce if it was determined that allowing a divorce would cause exceptionally serious damage to the other spouse or to any children in the marriage.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nThe issue of passing divorce legislation came to a head in 1981, pitting the Catholic Church more visibly against Spain's leftist elements. The new Pope, [[John Paul II]], appointed a conservative Nuncio in Madrid who would speak much more openly about his political opposition to government reforms on the issue.<ref name=\":0\" /> At the same time UCD Minister of Justice I\u00f1igo Cavero was replaced by the more liberal social democrat Francisco Fern\u00e1ndez Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez who altered the text of the proposed bill in order to make it be more liberal, despite opposition from Christian democrats who preferred Fern\u00e1ndez Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez's text.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Fern\u00e1ndez Ordo\u00f1ez famously announced during the debate, \"We cannot prevent marriages breaking up, but we can prevent suffering from broken marriages.\" ({{Lang-es|\u201cNo podemos impedir que los matrimonios se rompan pero s\u00ed podemos impedir el sufrimiento de los matrimonios rotos\u201d.}})<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.historiaespanaymundo.com/secciones/historia-contemporanea/historica-ley-divorcio-manada|title=La hist\u00f3rica ley de divorcio y \u201cLa Manada\u201d|website=www.historiaespanaymundo.com|language=es|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref> Because of his support for the passage of the law, his fellow ministers asked for his resignation.<ref name=\":7\" /> [[Ana Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez del Campo]], the president of a feminist organization, said of the Fern\u00e1ndez Ordo\u00f1ez's actions, \"The Church offered fierce resistance.

Another three requests were filed in other parts of Catalonia. Numbers were lower in other parts of Spain. On the first day, only two divorce applications were filed in Madrid. None were applied for in Bilbao, Seville, Valladolid and Valencia. Demand rapidly increased in Barcelona, with 1,400 requests for divorce within the first three months of legalization. Barcelona did not set up a Family Court to handle divorce cases until September 1981.

In 1991, Brokop issued her debut album, ''[[My Love (Lisa Brokop album)|My Love]]'', on the independent label Libre Records in Canada. It was in 1994, Brokop signed with Patriot Records, a label owned by [[Liberty Records]] and released her second album ''[[Every Little Girl's Dream]]'' in both Canada and the United States. The album was certified Gold by the [[Music Canada|CRIA]], for sales of 50,000 copies, in October 1995. ''[[Lisa Brokop (album)|Lisa Brokop]]'' followed in 1996 on [[Capitol Records|Capitol Nashville]], the album's commercial failure in both Canada and U.S. forced Brokop and Capitol to part ways.\n\nIn 1998, Brokop signed with [[Columbia Records]] and released the Canadian only release, ''[[When You Get to Be You]]''. The album was scheduled for release in the United States, but due to all singles failing at radio, the album was never released. ''[[Undeniable (Lisa Brokop album)|Undeniable]]'', was issued in 2000 on the independent Cosmo Records label. Five years after the release of her previous album, Brokop returned with ''[[Hey, Do You Know Me]]'' released in 2005 on [[Curb Records]] in Canada. Brokop's most recent album, ''[[The Patsy Cline Project]]'', was issued in 2015.\n\n==Studio albums==\n===1990s===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Title\n!

The [[metre]] is a unit of length that represents a definite predetermined length. When we say 10&nbsp;metres (or 10&nbsp;m), we actually mean 10 times the definite predetermined length called \"metre\".\nMeasurement is a process of determining how large or small a physical quantity is as compared to a basic reference quantity of the same kind.\n\nThe definition, agreement, and practical use of units of measurement have played a crucial role in human endeavour from early ages up to the present. A multitude of [[System of measurement|systems of units]] used to be very common. Now there is a global standard, the [[International System of Units]] (SI), the modern form of the [[metric system]].\n\nIn trade, '''weights and measures''' is often a subject of governmental regulation, to ensure fairness and transparency. The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) is tasked with ensuring worldwide uniformity of measurements and their traceability to the International System of Units (SI).\n\n[[Metrology]] is the science of developing nationally and internationally accepted units of measurement.\n\nIn [[physics]] and metrology, units are standards for [[measurement]] of physical quantities that need clear definitions to be useful. [[Reproducibility]] of experimental results is central to the [[scientific method]]. A standard system of units facilitates this. Scientific systems of units are a refinement of the concept of weights and measures historically developed for commercial purposes.<ref>https://www.texasgateway.org/resource/13-language-physics-physical-quantities-and-units</ref>\n\n[[Science]], [[medicine]], and [[engineering]] often use larger and smaller units of measurement than those used in everyday life. The judicious selection of the units of measurement can aid researchers in [[problem solving]] (see, for example, [[dimensional analysis]]).\n\nIn the [[social sciences]], there are no standard units of measurement and the theory and practice of measurement is studied in [[psychometrics]] and the [[theory of conjoint measurement]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of measurement}}\n\nA unit of measurement is a standardised [[quantity]] of a physical property, used as a factor to express occurring quantities of that property. Units of measurement were among the earliest tools invented by humans. Primitive societies needed rudimentary measures for many tasks: constructing dwellings of an appropriate size and shape, fashioning clothing, or bartering food or raw materials.\n\nThe earliest known uniform systems of measurement seem to have all been created sometime in the [[4th millennium BC|4th]] and [[3rd millennium BC|3rd millennia BC]] among the ancient peoples of [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley]], and perhaps also [[Elam]] in [[Iran|Persia]] as well.\n\nWeights and measures are mentioned in the [[Bible]] (Leviticus 19:35\u201336). It is a commandment to be honest and have fair measures.\n\nIn the ''[[Magna Carta]]'' of 1215 (The Great Charter) with the seal of [[John, King of England|King John]], put before him by the Barons of England, King John agreed in Clause 35 \"There shall be one measure of wine throughout our whole realm, and one measure of ale and one measure of corn\u2014namely, the London quart;\u2014and one width of dyed and russet and hauberk cloths\u2014namely, two ells below the selvage...\"\n\nAs of the 21st Century, multiple unit systems are used all over the world such as the United States Customary System, the British Customary System, and the International System. However, the United States is the only industrialized country that has not yet completely converted to the Metric System. The systematic effort to develop a universally acceptable system of units dates back to 1790 when the French National Assembly charged the French Academy of Sciences to come up such a unit system. This system was the precursor to the metric system which was quickly developed in France but did not take on universal acceptance until 1875 when The Metric Convention Treaty was signed by 17 nations. After this treaty was signed, a General Conference of Weights and Measures (CGPM) was established. The CGPM produced the current SI system which was adopted in 1954 at the 10th conference of weights and measures. Currently, the United States is a dual-system society which uses both the SI system and the US Customary system.<ref>{{cite book|authors=Yunus A. \u00c7engel & Michael A. Boles|title=Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=TN|isbn=9780073398174|pages=996|edition=Eighth|date=2002}}</ref>\n\n==Systems of units==\n{{main|System of measurement}}\nThe use of a single unit of measurement for some quantity has obvious drawbacks. For example, it is impractical to use the same unit for the distance between two cities and the length of a needle. Thus, historically they would develop independently. One way to make large numbers or small fractions easier to read, is to use [[unit prefixes]].\n\nAt some point in time though, the need to relate the two units might arise, and consequently the need to choose one unit as defining the other or vice versa. For example, an [[inch]] could be defined in terms of a [[Barleycorn (unit)|barleycorn]]. A system of measurement is a collection of units of measurement and rules relating them to each other.\n\nAs [[science]] progressed, a need arose to relate the measurement systems of different quantities, like length and weight and volume. The effort of attempting to relate different traditional systems between each other exposed many inconsistencies, and brought about the development of new units and systems.  \n\nThe system of units varies from country to country and some of the different system of units are [[Centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second system of units|CGS system of units]], [[Foot\u2013pound\u2013second system|FPS system of units]], [[MKS system of units]] and [[International System of Units|SI system of units]]. Among the different system of units using in the world, the most widely used and internationally accepted one is the [[International System of Units]], or SI system of units. In this SI units system, there are seven [[SI base unit]]s and three supplementary units. The base SI units are metre, kilogram, second, kelvin, ampere, candela and the mole and the three supplementary SI units are radian, steradian and becquerel. All [[SI derived unit|other SI units]] can be derived from these base units.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.helpyoubetter.com/measurement-in-physics-and-si-units-of-measurement/|title=Measurement in Physics & SI units of Measurement|date=15 November 2018|website=HelpYouBetter|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref> \n\nSystems of measurement in modern use include the [[metric system]], the [[imperial system]], and [[United States customary units]]. \n \n===Traditional systems===\nHistorically many of the systems of measurement which had been in use were to some extent based on the dimensions of the human body. As a result, units of measure could vary not only from location to location, but from person to person.\n\n===Metric systems===\n[[Metric system]]s of units have [[History of the metric system|evolved since the adoption of the original metric system]] in [[France]] in 1791. The current international standard metric system is the [[SI|International System of Units]] (abbreviated to SI). An important feature of modern systems is [[standardization]]. Each unit has a universally recognized size.\n[[File:Tabella conversione metrica 1860 MG 7771.jpg|thumb|An example of [[metrication]] in 1860 when Tuscany became part of modern Italy (ex. one \"libbra\" = 339.54 grams)]]\n\nBoth the [[imperial units]] and [[US customary units]] derive from earlier [[English unit]]s. Imperial units were mostly used in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] and the former [[British Empire]]. US customary units are still the main system of measurement used in the [[United States]] outside of science, medicine, many sectors of industry, and some of government and military, and despite Congress having legally authorised metric measure on 28 July 1866.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url         = http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/laws/metric-act.html\n |title       = US Metric Act of 1866\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20141010211054/http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/laws/metric-act.html\n |archivedate = 10 October 2014\n |df          = dmy-all\n}} as amended by Public Law 110\u201369 dated 9 August 2007</ref> Some steps towards US [[metrication]] have been made, particularly the redefinition of basic US and imperial units to derive exactly from SI units.

Systems of units based on these are called [[natural units]]. Similar to natural units, [[atomic units]] (au) are a convenient [[system of units]] of measurement used in [[atomic physics]].\n\nAlso a great number of [[List of unusual units of measurement|unusual and non-standard units]] may be encountered. These may include the [[solar mass]] ({{val|2|e=30|u=kg}}), the [[TNT equivalent|megaton]] (the energy released by detonating one million tons of [[trinitrotoluene]], TNT) and the [[electronvolt]].\n\n===Legal control of weights and measures===\nTo reduce the incidence of retail fraud, many national [[statutes]] have standard definitions of weights and measures that may be used (hence \"[[statute measure]]\"), and these are verified by legal officers.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Informal comparison to familiar concepts===\n{{mainarticle|List of unusual units of measurement}}\nIn informal settings, a quantity may be described as multiples of that of a familiar entity, which can be easier to contextualize than a value in a formal unit system. For instance, a publication may describe an area in a foreign country as a number of multiples of the area of a region local to the readership. The propensity for certain concepts to be used frequently can give rise to loosely defined \"systems\" of units.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Marsh |first1=David |title=Mind your language: Wales, Belgium and other units of measurement |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/mind-your-language/2010/may/17/mind-your-language-david-marsh |accessdate=30 August 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=17 May 2010 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Size of Wales |url=https://www.economist.com/johnson/2010/06/11/size-of-wales |accessdate=30 August 2018 |work=The Economist |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Base and derived units==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Measurement]] -->\nFor most quantities a unit is necessary to communicate values of that physical quantity. For example, conveying to someone a particular length without using some sort of unit is impossible, because a length cannot be described without a reference used to make sense of the value given.\n\nBut not all quantities require a unit of their own. Using physical laws, units of quantities can be expressed as combinations of units of other quantities. Thus only a small set of units is required. These units are taken as the ''base units and the o''ther units are ''derived units''. Thus base units are the units of the quantities which are independent of other quantities and they are the units of length, mass, time, electric current, temperature, luminous intensity and the amount of substance. Derived units are the units of the quantities which are derived from the base quantities and some of the derived units are the units of speed, work, acceleration, energy, pressure etc.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDifferent systems of units are based on different choices of a set of related units including fundamental and derived units. \n\n==Calculations with units of measurement==\n\n===Units as dimensions===\nAny value of a [[physical quantity]] is expressed as a comparison to a unit of that quantity. For example, the value of a physical quantity ''Z'' is expressed as the product of a unit [Z] and a numerical factor:\n\n:<math>Z = n \\times [Z] = n [Z].</math> For example, let <math>Z</math> be \"2 candlesticks\", then <math>Z = 2 [Z] = 2 </math> candlestick.\n\nThe multiplication sign is usually left out, just as it is left out between variables in scientific notation of formulas. The conventions used to express quantities is referred to as [[quantity calculus]]. In formulas the unit [Z] can be treated as if it were a specific magnitude of a kind of physical [[dimension]]: see [[dimensional analysis]] for more on this treatment.\n\nUnits can only be added or subtracted if they are the same type; however units can always be multiplied or divided, as [[George Gamow]] used to explain. Let <math>Z_1</math> be \"2 candlesticks\" and <math>Z_2</math> \"3 cabdrivers\", then\n\n:\"2 candlesticks\" times \"3 cabdrivers\" <math>= [Z_1][Z_2] = 6 </math> candlestick <math> \\times </math> cabdriver.\n\nA distinction should be made between units and standards. A unit is fixed by its definition, and is independent of physical conditions such as temperature. By contrast, a standard is a physical realization of a unit, and realizes that unit only under certain physical conditions. For example, the metre is a unit, while a metal bar is a standard. One metre is the same length regardless of temperature, but a metal bar will be exactly one metre long only at a certain temperature.\n\nThere are certain rules that have to be used when dealing with units:\n\n* Treat units algebraically. Only add like terms. When a unit is divided by itself, the division yields a unitless one. When two different units are multiplied or divided, the result is a new unit, referred to by the combination of the units. For instance, in SI, the unit of speed is metres per second (m/s). See [[dimensional analysis]]. A unit can be multiplied by itself, creating a unit with an exponent (e.g. m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>). Put simply, units obey the laws of indices. (See [[Exponentiation]].)\n* Some units have special names, however these should be treated like their equivalents. For example, one newton (N) is equivalent to 1&nbsp;kg\u22c5m/s<sup>2</sup>. Thus a quantity may have several unit designations, for example: the unit for [[surface tension]] can be referred to as either N/m (newton per metre) or kg/s<sup>2</sup> (kilogram per second squared). Whether these designations are equivalent is disputed amongst metrologists.<ref name=\"Emerson\">{{Cite journal | title = On quantity calculus and units of measurement | first = W.H. | last = Emerson | year = 2008 |journal = [[Metrologia]] | volume = 45 | pages = 134\u2013138 |bibcode = 2008Metro..45..134E |doi = 10.1088/0026-1394/45/2/002 | issue = 2}}</ref>\n\n===Expressing a physical value in terms of another unit===<!-- This section is linked from [[Watt-hour]] -->\n[[Conversion of units]] involves comparison of different standard physical values, either of a single physical quantity or of a physical quantity and a combination of other physical quantities.\n\nStarting with:\n\n:<math>Z = n_i \\times [Z]_i</math>\n\nreplace the original unit <math>[Z]_i</math> with its meaning in terms of the desired unit <math>[Z]_j</math>, e.g. if <math>[Z]_i = c_{ij} \\times [Z]_j</math>, then:\n\n:<math>Z = n_i \\times (c_{ij} \\times [Z]_j) = (n_i \\times c_{ij}) \\times [Z]_j</math>\n\nNow <math>n_i</math> and <math>c_{ij}</math> are both numerical values, so just calculate their product.\n\nOr, which is just mathematically the same thing, multiply ''Z'' by unity, the product is still ''Z'':\n\n:<math>Z = n_i \\times [Z]_i \\times ( c_{ij} \\times [Z]_j/[Z]_i )</math>\n\nFor example, you have an expression for a physical value ''Z'' involving the unit ''feet per second'' (<math>[Z]_i</math>) and you want it in terms of the unit ''miles per hour'' (<math>[Z]_j</math>):\n\n{{ordered list\n|1= Find facts relating the original unit to the desired unit:\n\n:1 mile = 5280 feet and 1 hour = 3600 seconds\n\n|2= Next use the above equations to construct a fraction that has a value of unity and that contains units such that, when it is multiplied with the original physical value, will cancel the original units:\n\n:<math>1 = \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{mi}}{5280\\,\\mathrm{ft}}\\quad \\mathrm{and}\\quad 1 = \\frac{3600\\,\\mathrm{s}}{1\\,\\mathrm{h}}</math>\n\n|3= Last, multiply the original expression of the physical value by the fraction, called a ''[[conversion factor]]'', to obtain the same physical value expressed in terms of a different unit. Note: since valid conversion factors are [[dimensionless]] and have a numerical value of [[one]], multiplying any physical quantity by such a conversion factor (which is 1) does not change that physical quantity.\n\n:<math> 52.8\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{ft}}{\\mathrm{s}} =\n 52.8\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{ft}}{\\mathrm{s}}\n \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{mi}}{5280\\,\\mathrm{ft}}\n \\frac{3600\\,\\mathrm{s}}{1\\,\\mathrm{h}} =\n \\frac {52.8 \\times 3600}{5280}\\,\\mathrm{mi/h}\n = 36\\,\\mathrm{mi/h}</math>\n}}\n\nOr as an example using the metric system, you have a value of fuel economy in the unit ''litres per 100 kilometres'' and you want it in terms of the unit ''microlitres per metre'':\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{\\frac{9\\,\\rm{L}}{100\\,\\rm{km}}} =\n \\mathrm{\\frac{9\\,\\rm{L}}{100\\,\\rm{km}}}\n\n \\mathrm{\\frac{1000000\\,\\rm{\\mu L}}{1\\,\\rm{L}}}\n \\mathrm{\\frac{1\\,\\rm{km}}{1000\\,\\rm{m}}} =\n \\frac {9 \\times 1000000}{100 \\times 1000}\\,\\mathrm{\\mu L/m} =\n 90\\,\\mathrm{\\mu L/m}</math>\n\n==Real-world implications==\nOne example of the importance of agreed units is the failure of the [[NASA]] [[Mars Climate Orbiter]], which was accidentally destroyed on a mission to Mars in September 1999 instead of entering orbit due to miscommunications about the value of forces: different computer programs used different units of measurement ([[Newton (unit)|newton]] versus [[pound force]]).

The [[metre]] is a unit of length that represents a definite predetermined length. When we say 10&nbsp;metres (or 10&nbsp;m), we actually mean 10 times the definite predetermined length called \"metre\".\nMeasurement is a process of determining how large or small a physical quantity is as compared to a basic reference quantity of the same kind.\n\nThe definition, agreement, and practical use of units of measurement have played a crucial role in human endeavour from early ages up to the present. A multitude of [[System of measurement|systems of units]] used to be very common. Now there is a global standard, the [[International System of Units]] (SI), the modern form of the [[metric system]].\n\nIn trade, '''weights and measures''' is often a subject of governmental regulation, to ensure fairness and transparency. The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) is tasked with ensuring worldwide uniformity of measurements and their traceability to the International System of Units (SI).\n\n[[Metrology]] is the science of developing nationally and internationally accepted units of measurement.\n\nIn [[physics]] and metrology, units are standards for [[measurement]] of physical quantities that need clear definitions to be useful. [[Reproducibility]] of experimental results is central to the [[scientific method]]. A standard system of units facilitates this. Scientific systems of units are a refinement of the concept of weights and measures historically developed for commercial purposes.<ref>https://www.texasgateway.org/resource/13-language-physics-physical-quantities-and-units</ref>\n\n[[Science]], [[medicine]], and [[engineering]] often use larger and smaller units of measurement than those used in everyday life. The judicious selection of the units of measurement can aid researchers in [[problem solving]] (see, for example, [[dimensional analysis]]).\n\nIn the [[social sciences]], there are no standard units of measurement and the theory and practice of measurement is studied in [[psychometrics]] and the [[theory of conjoint measurement]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of measurement}}\n\nA unit of measurement is a standardised [[quantity]] of a physical property, used as a factor to express occurring quantities of that property. Units of measurement were among the earliest tools invented by humans. Primitive societies needed rudimentary measures for many tasks: constructing dwellings of an appropriate size and shape, fashioning clothing, or bartering food or raw materials.\n\nThe earliest known uniform systems of measurement seem to have all been created sometime in the [[4th millennium BC|4th]] and [[3rd millennium BC|3rd millennia BC]] among the ancient peoples of [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley]], and perhaps also [[Elam]] in [[Iran|Persia]] as well.\n\nWeights and measures are mentioned in the [[Bible]] (Leviticus 19:35\u201336). It is a commandment to be honest and have fair measures.\n\nIn the ''[[Magna Carta]]'' of 1215 (The Great Charter) with the seal of [[John, King of England|King John]], put before him by the Barons of England, King John agreed in Clause 35 \"There shall be one measure of wine throughout our whole realm, and one measure of ale and one measure of corn\u2014namely, the London quart;\u2014and one width of dyed and russet and hauberk cloths\u2014namely, two ells below the selvage...\"\n\nAs of the 21st Century, multiple unit systems are used all over the world such as the United States Customary System, the British Customary System, and the International System. However, the United States is the only industrialized country that has not yet completely converted to the Metric System. The systematic effort to develop a universally acceptable system of units dates back to 1790 when the French National Assembly charged the French Academy of Sciences to come up such a unit system. This system was the precursor to the metric system which was quickly developed in France but did not take on universal acceptance until 1875 when The Metric Convention Treaty was signed by 17 nations. After this treaty was signed, a General Conference of Weights and Measures (CGPM) was established. The CGPM produced the current SI system which was adopted in 1954 at the 10th conference of weights and measures. Currently, the United States is a dual-system society which uses both the SI system and the US Customary system.<ref>{{cite book|authors=Yunus A. \u00c7engel & Michael A. Boles|title=Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=TN|isbn=9780073398174|pages=996|edition=Eighth|date=2002}}</ref>\n\n==Systems of units==\n{{main|System of measurement}}\nThe use of a single unit of measurement for some quantity has obvious drawbacks. For example, it is impractical to use the same unit for the distance between two cities and the length of a needle. Thus, historically they would develop independently. One way to make large numbers or small fractions easier to read, is to use [[unit prefixes]].\n\nAt some point in time though, the need to relate the two units might arise, and consequently the need to choose one unit as defining the other or vice versa. For example, an [[inch]] could be defined in terms of a [[Barleycorn (unit)|barleycorn]]. A system of measurement is a collection of units of measurement and rules relating them to each other.\n\nAs [[science]] progressed, a need arose to relate the measurement systems of different quantities, like length and weight and volume. The effort of attempting to relate different traditional systems between each other exposed many inconsistencies, and brought about the development of new units and systems.  \n\nThe system of units varies from country to country and some of the different system of units are [[Centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second system of units|CGS system of units]], [[Foot\u2013pound\u2013second system|FPS system of units]], [[MKS system of units]] and [[International System of Units|SI system of units]]. Among the different system of units using in the world, the most widely used and internationally accepted one is the [[International System of Units]], or SI system of units. In this SI units system, there are seven [[SI base unit]]s and three supplementary units. The base SI units are metre, kilogram, second, kelvin, ampere, candela and the mole and the three supplementary SI units are radian, steradian and becquerel. All [[SI derived unit|other SI units]] can be derived from these base units.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.helpyoubetter.com/measurement-in-physics-and-si-units-of-measurement/|title=Measurement in Physics & SI units of Measurement|date=15 November 2018|website=HelpYouBetter|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref> \n\nSystems of measurement in modern use include the [[metric system]], the [[imperial system]], and [[United States customary units]]. \n \n===Traditional systems===\nHistorically many of the systems of measurement which had been in use were to some extent based on the dimensions of the human body. As a result, units of measure could vary not only from location to location, but from person to person.\n\n===Metric systems===\n[[Metric system]]s of units have [[History of the metric system|evolved since the adoption of the original metric system]] in [[France]] in 1791. The current international standard metric system is the [[SI|International System of Units]] (abbreviated to SI). An important feature of modern systems is [[standardization]]. Each unit has a universally recognized size.\n[[File:Tabella conversione metrica 1860 MG 7771.jpg|thumb|An example of [[metrication]] in 1860 when Tuscany became part of modern Italy (ex. one \"libbra\" = 339.54 grams)]]\n\nBoth the [[imperial units]] and [[US customary units]] derive from earlier [[English unit]]s. Imperial units were mostly used in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] and the former [[British Empire]]. US customary units are still the main system of measurement used in the [[United States]] outside of science, medicine, many sectors of industry, and some of government and military, and despite Congress having legally authorised metric measure on 28 July 1866.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url         = http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/laws/metric-act.html\n |title       = US Metric Act of 1866\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20141010211054/http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/laws/metric-act.html\n |archivedate = 10 October 2014\n |df          = dmy-all\n}} as amended by Public Law 110\u201369 dated 9 August 2007</ref> Some steps towards US [[metrication]] have been made, particularly the redefinition of basic US and imperial units to derive exactly from SI units.

Systems of units based on these are called [[natural units]]. Similar to natural units, [[atomic units]] (au) are a convenient [[system of units]] of measurement used in [[atomic physics]].\n\nAlso a great number of [[List of unusual units of measurement|unusual and non-standard units]] may be encountered. These may include the [[solar mass]] ({{val|2|e=30|u=kg}}), the [[TNT equivalent|megaton]] (the energy released by detonating one million tons of [[trinitrotoluene]], TNT) and the [[electronvolt]].\n\n===Legal control of weights and measures===\nTo reduce the incidence of retail fraud, many national [[statutes]] have standard definitions of weights and measures that may be used (hence \"[[statute measure]]\"), and these are verified by legal officers.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Informal comparison to familiar concepts===\n{{mainarticle|List of unusual units of measurement}}\nIn informal settings, a quantity may be described as multiples of that of a familiar entity, which can be easier to contextualize than a value in a formal unit system. For instance, a publication may describe an area in a foreign country as a number of multiples of the area of a region local to the readership. The propensity for certain concepts to be used frequently can give rise to loosely defined \"systems\" of units.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Marsh |first1=David |title=Mind your language: Wales, Belgium and other units of measurement |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/mind-your-language/2010/may/17/mind-your-language-david-marsh |accessdate=30 August 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=17 May 2010 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Size of Wales |url=https://www.economist.com/johnson/2010/06/11/size-of-wales |accessdate=30 August 2018 |work=The Economist |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Base and derived units==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Measurement]] -->\nFor most quantities a unit is necessary to communicate values of that physical quantity. For example, conveying to someone a particular length without using some sort of unit is impossible, because a length cannot be described without a reference used to make sense of the value given.\n\nBut not all quantities require a unit of their own. Using physical laws, units of quantities can be expressed as combinations of units of other quantities. Thus only a small set of units is required. These units are taken as the ''base units and the o''ther units are ''derived units''. Thus base units are the units of the quantities which are independent of other quantities and they are the units of length, mass, time, electric current, temperature, luminous intensity and the amount of substance. Derived units are the units of the quantities which are derived from the base quantities and some of the derived units are the units of speed, work, acceleration, energy, pressure etc.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDifferent systems of units are based on different choices of a set of related units including fundamental and derived units. \n\n==Calculations with units of measurement==\n\n===Units as dimensions===\nAny value of a [[physical quantity]] is expressed as a comparison to a unit of that quantity. For example, the value of a physical quantity ''Z'' is expressed as the product of a unit [Z] and a numerical factor:\n\n:<math>Z = n \\times [Z] = n [Z].</math> For example, let <math>Z</math> be \"2 candlesticks\", then <math>Z = 2 [Z] = 2 </math> candlestick.\n\nThe multiplication sign is usually left out, just as it is left out between variables in scientific notation of formulas. The conventions used to express quantities is referred to as [[quantity calculus]]. In formulas the unit [Z] can be treated as if it were a specific magnitude of a kind of physical [[dimension]]: see [[dimensional analysis]] for more on this treatment.\n\nUnits can only be added or subtracted if they are the same type; however units can always be multiplied or divided, as [[George Gamow]] used to explain. Let <math>Z_1</math> be \"2 candlesticks\" and <math>Z_2</math> \"3 cabdrivers\", then\n\n:\"2 candlesticks\" times \"3 cabdrivers\" <math>= [Z_1][Z_2] = 6 </math> candlestick <math> \\times </math> cabdriver.\n\nA distinction should be made between units and standards. A unit is fixed by its definition, and is independent of physical conditions such as temperature. By contrast, a standard is a physical realization of a unit, and realizes that unit only under certain physical conditions. For example, the metre is a unit, while a metal bar is a standard. One metre is the same length regardless of temperature, but a metal bar will be exactly one metre long only at a certain temperature.\n\nThere are certain rules that have to be used when dealing with units:\n\n* Treat units algebraically. Only add like terms. When a unit is divided by itself, the division yields a unitless one. When two different units are multiplied or divided, the result is a new unit, referred to by the combination of the units. For instance, in SI, the unit of speed is metres per second (m/s). See [[dimensional analysis]]. A unit can be multiplied by itself, creating a unit with an exponent (e.g. m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>). Put simply, units obey the laws of indices. (See [[Exponentiation]].)\n* Some units have special names, however these should be treated like their equivalents. For example, one newton (N) is equivalent to 1&nbsp;kg\u22c5m/s<sup>2</sup>. Thus a quantity may have several unit designations, for example: the unit for [[surface tension]] can be referred to as either N/m (newton per metre) or kg/s<sup>2</sup> (kilogram per second squared). Whether these designations are equivalent is disputed amongst metrologists.<ref name=\"Emerson\">{{Cite journal | title = On quantity calculus and units of measurement | first = W.H. | last = Emerson | year = 2008 |journal = [[Metrologia]] | volume = 45 | pages = 134\u2013138 |bibcode = 2008Metro..45..134E |doi = 10.1088/0026-1394/45/2/002 | issue = 2}}</ref>\n\n===Expressing a physical value in terms of another unit===<!-- This section is linked from [[Watt-hour]] -->\n[[Conversion of units]] involves comparison of different standard physical values, either of a single physical quantity or of a physical quantity and a combination of other physical quantities.\n\nStarting with:\n\n:<math>Z = n_i \\times [Z]_i</math>\n\njust replace the original unit <math>[Z]_i</math> with its meaning in terms of the desired unit <math>[Z]_j</math>, e.g. if <math>[Z]_i = c_{ij} \\times [Z]_j</math>, then:\n\n:<math>Z = n_i \\times (c_{ij} \\times [Z]_j) = (n_i \\times c_{ij}) \\times [Z]_j</math>\n\nNow <math>n_i</math> and <math>c_{ij}</math> are both numerical values, so just calculate their product.\n\nOr, which is just mathematically the same thing, multiply ''Z'' by unity, the product is still ''Z'':\n\n:<math>Z = n_i \\times [Z]_i \\times ( c_{ij} \\times [Z]_j/[Z]_i )</math>\n\nFor example, you have an expression for a physical value ''Z'' involving the unit ''feet per second'' (<math>[Z]_i</math>) and you want it in terms of the unit ''miles per hour'' (<math>[Z]_j</math>):\n\n{{ordered list\n|1= Find facts relating the original unit to the desired unit:\n\n:1 mile = 5280 feet and 1 hour = 3600 seconds\n\n|2= Next use the above equations to construct a fraction that has a value of unity and that contains units such that, when it is multiplied with the original physical value, will cancel the original units:\n\n:<math>1 = \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{mi}}{5280\\,\\mathrm{ft}}\\quad \\mathrm{and}\\quad 1 = \\frac{3600\\,\\mathrm{s}}{1\\,\\mathrm{h}}</math>\n\n|3= Last, multiply the original expression of the physical value by the fraction, called a ''[[conversion factor]]'', to obtain the same physical value expressed in terms of a different unit.

{"title_page": "Women in PSOE in Francoist Spain and the democratic transition", "text_new": "{{Socialism sidebar}}\n{{Social democracy sidebar}}\n\nWomen in PSOE in Francoist Spain had been involved in important socialist activism since the 1930s, including behind the scenes during the Asturian miners' strike of 1934, even as the party offered few leadership roles to women and address the issues of women.  During the Civil War, the party was one of the few left wing actors to reject the idea of women on the front, believing women instead should take care of the home.\n\nSocialists continued to have a fraught relationship with feminism during the post-war early Franco period with 10% female membership, and Partido Comunista Espa\u00f1ola (PCE) overtook PSOE in importance as the dominant left wing group in the Spanish interior.  Most of the prominent socialists leaders and many women in PSOE fled to exile abroad. Those who remained were subject to severe repression. Many were imprisoned.  Some were executed. During the 1940s, PSOE's interior activities were clandestine. Toulouse would become the home of leadership on the exterior, with exile women in France and Mexico playing important exterior roles. Leadership faced numerous challenges in the 1950s as a result of regime repression.  In the 1960s, interior and external divisions came out into the open with women like Josefina Arrillaga and Carmen Garc\u00eda Bloise playing critical roles in the unfolding drama.  The early 1970s saw a period of renewal and renovation  of the PSOE executive committee.  Addressing women's issue was not something PSOE was able to do, as women in power understood that an attempt to do so would lead to internal party divisions.  Divided amongst themselves, PSOE aligned women would be at the forefront of introducing more explicitly socialist and politically class focused third-wave feminism to Spain.\n\nThe transition would see Adolfo Suarez's Uni\u00f3n de Centro Democr\u00e1tico (UCD) come to power in 1977 following Franco's 1975 death.  Ignoring women's issues would be one of the reasons UCD lost the 1982 elections and PSOE come into power. PSOE would declare its explicit support for feminism by 2019.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|Francoist Spain}}\nFrancoist Spain was a [[Pseudo-|pseudo]]-[[Fascism|fascist]] state whose ideology rejected what it considered the inorganic democracy of the Second Republic.  It was an embrace of [[Totalitarian democracy|organic democracy]], defined as a reassertion of traditional Spanish [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] values that served as a counterpoint to the Communism of the Soviet Union during the same period.  It came into exist in 1939 following the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=OllkigpBDsIC|title=The Seduction of Modern Spain: The Female Body and the Francoist Body Politic|last=Morcillo|first=Aurora G.|date=2010|publisher=Bucknell University Press|isbn=9780838757536|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=c7mBAgAAQBAJ|title=Women and Spanish Fascism: The Women's Section of the Falange 1934-1959|last=Richmond|first=Kathleen J.

The work of the pair was critical in establishing the \u201cmalla de cristal\u201d, a network that allowed communication between imprisoned socialist militants with their brethren in exile.

Female leaders in the group in this period included Serra i Moret.  PSOE's relationship with the group in this era was unstable, and Lucila Fern\u00e1ndez was the only prominent female figure in PSOE's Catalan organization.<ref name=\":2\" /> During the 1950s and 1960s, neither UGT nor PSOE put much consideration into political ideologies and practices related to improving the lives of women.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFollowing the death of PSOE leader Tom\u00e1s Centeno in prison in 1953, the PSOE Executive Committee and broader leadership were largely destroyed. Starting in the 1950s, Josefina Arrillaga Lansorena, a lawyer, began attending clandestine socialist meetings in Madrid.  She became involved with Antonio Amat, who wanted to replace the dead Tom\u00e1s Centeno in order to reconstruct both UGT and PSOE.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nSocialist women played an important role in Asturias by doing clandestine work, such as coordinating between cells, supporting covert strike actions and taking over roles left vacant because male leaders were incarcerated.<ref name=\":2\" /> From 1957 to 1962, the Franco regime faced labor strikes in Asturias, with the biggest in Pozo Mar\u00eda Luisa. Sindicato de los Obreros Mineros de Asturias (SOMA) had its greatest strength in this region, with socialist and communist women leading the organization of strikes on 23 March 1957.  They organized in two locations, including the esplanade of Pozo Mar\u00eda Luisa and at the highway connecting Oviedo with Campo de Caso.  Their actions would serve as a blueprint for future strikes at the Nal\u00f3n and Caudal mining basins.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nPSOE and UGT were almost decapitated in 1958 following a police arrest of many of the leading figures of the movement from Asturias, Basque Country and Madrid. Antonio Amat was among those arrested.  He was represented by  Josefina Arrillaga Lansorena.  While Amat was in prison, Josefina Arrillaga Lansorena took control of the PSOE party apparatus.  Among the things she accomplished was creating a priority list agreed upon by other Madrid PSOE members.  This included maintaining a relationship with PSOE leadership in Toulouse, showing solidarity and support for PSOE prisoners, issuing regular newsletters and reports, and integrating the organization both internally and externally.  One of the most important things Arrillaga Lansorena did was establish a relationship with the socialist backed Asturian miners. Another important thing she did was make contact with foreign newspapers including Britain's ''[[The Times]]'', the American [[Associated Press]], and the French [[Agence France-Presse]] where she provided a different perspective on the realities of Francoist Spain.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn November 1958, there were a large number of raids conducted by the Spanish state that saw many people arrested and sent to prison around the whole of Spain.  People picked up in this period would include many women involved with the miners strike in Asturias earlier in the year.  Many of the women imprisoned as a consequence of the raid would go on to play leading roles in the Spanish socialist community of the 1960s.  Among those arrested was Josefina Arrillaga Lansorena.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 1958, Josefina Arrillaga and Jos\u00e9 Federico de Carvajal created a Spain based a UGT Lawyers' Office, which allowed the organization to provide legal services to many people including Antonio Alonso Ba\u00f1o, Luis Castillo Almena, Carlos Zayas and Mar\u00eda Luisa Su\u00e1rez Rold\u00e1n.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== 1960s ===\n\n==== Interior - external divisions ====\nBy 1959, divisions had emerged between socialist elements in the Spanish interior and those in leadership in Toulouse in the exterior. Josefina Arrillaga was at the center of this battle for the heart of PSOE and UGT.

New contacts would include [[Amnesty International]] founder [[Peter Benenson]], [[Fritz Erler (politician)|Fritz Erler]]  of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|German SPD]], German metalworks union [[IG Metall]], and UGT members like Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez-Montesinos living in exile in Germany.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMadrid based Josefina Arrillaga and Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez-Montesinos would further split from the Toulouse group over their support of the creation of the [[Alianza Sindical Obrera]] (ASO), which drew heavily from UGT membership and advocated for a radical change in approach for the movement in the interior.  Arrillaga  would support [[World Federation of Trade Unions]] (WFTU) participation by ASO, attending several of WFTU's international congresses. Arrillaga's participation internationally ended the monopoly held by Toulouse of representing PSOE internationally and as Spain's primary free trade unionist organization. Josefina Arrillaga later immigrated to Germany in 1966, which along with the arrest of figures like [[Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez Montesinos]] and the dissolution of the Madrid PSOE group, saw ASO go into the decline.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nCarmen Garc\u00eda Bloise was one of the female leaders inside PSOE during the 1960s.  She believed that PSOE and UGT needed to be governed from inside Spain, not from the exterior.  Along with others in the informal Paris group, she believed that militants inside Spain should be given greater weight and consideration inside PSOE and UGT.  Her position closely aligned her with ASO.  She played a critical role in understanding the need for PSOE to be governed from the interior and then assisting in moving those structures there from the exterior.<ref name=\":2\" /> From 1965 to 1970, Carmen Garc\u00eda Bloise was a member of the PSOE Steering Committee  in exile.

Encarna Vega and her husband Marcelo Garc\u00eda Su\u00e1rez played an important role in restructuring the local party apparatus.  Encarna Vega also became actively involved in clandestine activities like producing and distributing party propaganda, and distributing the ''[[El Socialista (newspaper)|El Socialista]]'' and ''[[Adelante (newspaper)|Adelante]]'' magazines.  <ref name=\":2\" /> \n\nThe arrest of the core of the Madrid group including Fern\u00e1ndez-Montesinos, Nuero and Nogu\u00e9s left Josefina Arrillaga uncertain.  The Lawyers Group could not overcome their loss.  The remaining Madrid group still had to deal with tensions from leadership in Toulouse.  Consequently, Arrillaga felt she could not overcome these difficulties and left for Germany in 1966 and became politically inactive.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n[[Movimiento Democr\u00e1tico de Mujeres]] (MDM) was created in 1965 in Barcelona by communist and Catalan socialist women.  The organization quickly found covert support among other women in northern Spain as they tried to accomplish socio-political goals.  Because of their overt feminist ideologies, some supporters worried MDM's \"''doble militancia''\" would diminish their effectiveness as they sought to work towards concrete political goals. The organization drew from two different eras of Spanish feminists.  The first was a community of older women who had suffered the most under the change from the Second Republic to Francoist Spain.  The second group was known as the \"pro preso\" generation who came of age  through clandestine neighborhood led activism.  This meant the organization's feminist goals were sometimes in conflict and not well defined as members had to navigate ideological differences in what being a feminist meant.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nMDM had always been strongly susceptible to party politics of both the Communists and Socialists.  In 1969, these ideological differences would lead to the organization splitting in Catalonia.  Because PCE was more organized in Madrid, MDM continued there and in other PCE strongholds.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAna Mar\u00eda Ruiz-Tagle Morales began her militancy in PSOE in 1965.  A labor lawyer by training, her militancy was assisted by Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez, with whom she shared an office in Seville. She played an important role by providing legal assistance on union affairs.  She served as a bridge to an earlier period with her collaborations with Dulce del Moral, who had previously been the most important militant in Andalusia.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nLudivina Garc\u00eda Arias, daughter of Spanish exiles, returned to Spain from Mexico in 1969.

The couple had their honeymoon in France so Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez could attend a Socialist Youth meeting in Toulouse. Returning from their honeymoon, Carmen Romero set up a house in 1969 which later became the headquarters for the Federaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Trabajadores de la Ense\u00f1anza de UGT at calle Espinosa and C\u00e1rcel in Seville.

The women that proposed the Secretariado Femenino would be responsible for proposing its elimination at the 1970 PSOE Congress.

Carmen Garc\u00eda Bloise was the primary defender of the Secretariado Femenino at the 1970 PSOE Congress.

At the same time, MDM-MLM also challenged traditional patriarchal left wing views on women.  They were also attacked by the right for being communists, anti-woman and anti-regime.

This gave them a third of the seats in the Cortes.<ref name=\":5\" /> Because Adolfo Suarez's party lacked an absolute majority to govern, he was forced to form a coalition with other more right leaning parties.  This resulted in a dilution of women's priorities and angered many women's rights advocates and feminists, serving to splinter these groups along ideological priority based grounds that saw one side view participation in the constitutional draft process as being part of emancipated citizenship while another faction saw it as oppressed women being forced to participate in their own repression. Radical feminists opposed to UCD felt vindicated in their doubts following the 1979 general elections, which saw 21 women or 6 percent of the 350 seats belonging to women, down from 22 in the previous congress.  At the same time, UCD continued to be the largest political organization for women with the most representation of any party in Congress, with 11 women deputies and 4 women senators.  In contrast, PSOE refused to address women's issues more broadly and to prioritize women's concerns.  They did not move women's positions up their list, and consequently the number of female PSOE representatives fell in 1979 to 6 from the previous high of 11.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAhead of the 15 June 1977 general elections, political and social conditions largely remained unchanged.

During the Civil War, the party was one of the few left wing actors to reject the idea of women on the front, believing women instead should take care of the home.\n\nSocialists continued to have a fraught relationship with feminism during the post-war early Franco period with 10% female membership, and Partido Comunista Espa\u00f1ola (PCE) overtook PSOE in importance as the dominant left wing group in the Spanish interior.  Most of the prominent socialists leaders and many women in PSOE fled to exile abroad. Those who remained were subject to severe repression. Many were imprisoned.  Some were executed. During the 1940s, PSOE's interior activities were clandestine. Toulouse would become the home of leadership on the exterior, with exile women in France and Mexico playing important exterior roles. Leadership faced numerous challenges in the 1950s as a result of regime repression.  In the 1960s, interior and external divisions came out into the open with women like Josefina Arrillaga and Carmen Garc\u00eda Bloise playing critical roles in the unfolding drama.  The early 1970s saw a period of renewal and renovation  of the PSOE executive committee.  Addressing women's issue was not something PSOE was able to do, as women in power understood that an attempt to do so would lead to internal party divisions.  Divided amongst themselves, PSOE aligned women would be at the forefront of introducing more explicitly socialist and politically class focused third-wave feminism to Spain.\n\nThe transition would see Adolfo Suarez's Uni\u00f3n de Centro Democr\u00e1tico (UCD) come to power in 1977 following Franco's 1975 death.  Ignoring women's issues would be one of the reasons UCD lost the 1982 elections and PSOE come into power. PSOE would declare its explicit support for feminism by 2019.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|Francoist Spain}}\nFrancoist Spain was a [[Pseudo-|pseudo]]-[[Fascism|fascist]] state whose ideology rejected what it considered the inorganic democracy of the Second Republic.

Female leaders in the group in this period included Serra i Moret.  PSOE's relationship with the group in this era was unstable, and Lucila Fern\u00e1ndez was the only prominent female figure in PSOE's Catalan organization.<ref name=\":2\" /> During the 1950s and 1960s, neither UGT nor PSOE put much consideration into political ideologies and practices related to improving the lives of women.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFollowing the death of PSOE leader Tom\u00e1s Centeno in prison in 1953, the PSOE Executive Committee and broader leadership were largely destroyed. Starting in the 1950s, Josefina Arrillaga Lansorena, a lawyer, began attending clandestine socialist meetings in Madrid.  She became involved with Antonio Amat, who wanted to replace the dead Tom\u00e1s Centeno in order to reconstruct both UGT and PSOE.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nSocialist women played an important role in Asturias by doing clandestine work, such as coordinating between cells, supporting covert strike actions and taking over roles left vacant because male leaders were incarcerated.<ref name=\":2\" /> From 1957 to 1962, the Franco regime faced labor strikes in Asturias, with the biggest in Pozo Mar\u00eda Luisa. Sindicato de los Obreros Mineros de Asturias (SOMA) had its greatest strength in this region, with socialist and communist women leading the organization of strikes on 23 March 1957.  They organized in two locations, including the esplanade of Pozo Mar\u00eda Luisa and at the highway connecting Oviedo with Campo de Caso.  Their actions would serve as a blueprint for future strikes at the Nal\u00f3n and Caudal mining basins.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nPSOE and UGT were almost decapitated in 1958 following a police arrest of many of the leading figures of the movement from Asturias, Basque Country and Madrid. Antonio Amat was among those arrested.  He was represented by  Josefina Arrillaga Lansorena.  While Amat was in prison, Josefina Arrillaga Lansorena took control of the PSOE party apparatus.  Among the things she accomplished was creating a priority list agreed upon by other Madrid PSOE members.  This included maintaining a relationship with PSOE leadership in Toulouse, showing solidarity and support for PSOE prisoners, issuing regular newsletters and reports, and integrating the organization both internally and externally.  One of the most important things Arrillaga Lansorena did was establish a relationship with the socialist backed Asturian miners. Another important thing she did was make contact with foreign newspapers including Britain's ''[[The Times]]'', the American [[Associated Press]], and the French [[Agence France-Presse]] where she provided a different perspective on the realities of Francoist Spain.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn November 1958, there were a large number of raids conducted by the Spanish state that saw many people arrested and sent to prison around the whole of Spain.  People picked up in this period would include many women involved with the miners strike in Asturias earlier in the year.  Many of the women imprisoned as a consequence of the raid would go on to play leading roles in the Spanish socialist community of the 1960s.  Among those arrested was Josefina Arrillaga Lansorena.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 1958, Josefina Arrillaga and Jos\u00e9 Federico de Carvajal created a Spain based a UGT Lawyers' Office, which allowed the organization to provide legal services to many people including Antonio Alonso Ba\u00f1o, Luis Castillo Almena, Carlos Zayas and Mar\u00eda Luisa Su\u00e1rez Rold\u00e1n.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== 1960s ===\n\n==== Interior - external divisions ====\nBy 1959, divisions had emerged between socialist elements in the Spanish interior and those in leadership in Toulouse in the exterior. Josefina Arrillaga was at the center of this battle for the heart of PSOE and UGT.

New contacts would include [[Amnesty International]] founder [[Peter Benenson]], [[Fritz Erler (politician)|Fritz Erler]]  of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|German SPD]], German metalworks union [[IG Metall]], and UGT members like Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez-Montesinos living in exile in Germany.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMadrid based Josefina Arrillaga and Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez-Montesinos would further split from the Toulouse group over their support of the creation of the [[Alianza Sindical Obrera]] (ASO), which drew heavily from UGT membership and advocated for a radical change in approach for the movement in the interior.  Arrillaga  would support [[World Federation of Trade Unions]] (WFTU) participation by ASO, attending several of WFTU's international congresses. Arrillaga's participation internationally ended the monopoly held by Toulouse of representing PSOE internationally and as Spain's primary free trade unionist organization. Josefina Arrillaga later immigrated to Germany in 1966, which along with the arrest of figures like [[Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez Montesinos]] and the dissolution of the Madrid PSOE group, saw ASO go into the decline.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nCarmen Garc\u00eda Bloise was one of the female leaders inside PSOE during the 1960s.  She believed that PSOE and UGT needed to be governed from inside Spain, not from the exterior.  Along with others in the informal Paris group, she believed that militants inside Spain should be given greater weight and consideration inside PSOE and UGT.  Her position closely aligned her with ASO.  She played a critical role in understanding the need for PSOE to be governed from the interior and then assisting in moving those structures there from the exterior.<ref name=\":2\" /> From 1965 to 1970, Carmen Garc\u00eda Bloise was a member of the PSOE Steering Committee  in exile.

Encarna Vega and her husband Marcelo Garc\u00eda Su\u00e1rez played an important role in restructuring the local party apparatus.  Encarna Vega also became actively involved in clandestine activities like producing and distributing party propaganda, and distributing the ''[[El Socialista (newspaper)|El Socialista]]'' and ''[[Adelante (newspaper)|Adelante]]'' magazines.  <ref name=\":2\" /> \n\nThe arrest of the core of the Madrid group including Fern\u00e1ndez-Montesinos, Nuero and Nogu\u00e9s left Josefina Arrillaga uncertain.  The Lawyers Group could not overcome their loss.  The remaining Madrid group still had to deal with tensions from leadership in Toulouse.  Consequently, Arrillaga felt she could not overcome these difficulties and left for Germany in 1966 and became politically inactive.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n[[Movimiento Democr\u00e1tico de Mujeres]] (MDM) was created in 1965 in Barcelona by communist and Catalan socialist women.  The organization quickly found covert support among other women in northern Spain as they tried to accomplish socio-political goals.  Because of their overt feminist ideologies, some supporters worried MDM's \"''doble militancia''\" would diminish their effectiveness as they sought to work towards concrete political goals. The organization drew from two different eras of Spanish feminists.  The first was a community of older women who had suffered the most under the change from the Second Republic to Francoist Spain.  The second group was known as the \"pro preso\" generation who came of age  through clandestine neighborhood led activism.  This meant the organization's feminist goals were sometimes in conflict and not well defined as members had to navigate ideological differences in what being a feminist meant.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nMDM had always been strongly susceptible to party politics of both the Communists and Socialists.  In 1969, these ideological differences would lead to the organization splitting in Catalonia.  Because PCE was more organized in Madrid, MDM continued there and in other PCE strongholds.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAna Mar\u00eda Ruiz-Tagle Morales began her militancy in PSOE in 1965.  A labor lawyer by training, her militancy was assisted by Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez, with whom she shared an office in Seville. She played an important role by providing legal assistance on union affairs.  She served as a bridge to an earlier period with her collaborations with Dulce del Moral , who had previously been the most important militant in Andalusia.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nLudivina Garc\u00eda Arias, daughter of Spanish exiles, returned to Spain from Mexico in 1969.

The couple had their honeymoon in France so Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez could attend a Socialist Youth meeting in Toulouse. Returning from their honeymoon, Carmen Romero set up an house in 1969 which later became the headquarters for the Federaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Trabajadores de la Ense\u00f1anza de UGT at calle Espinosa and C\u00e1rcel in Seville.

The women that proposed the Secretariado Femenino would be responsible for proposing its elimination at the 1970 PSOE Congress.

Carmen Garc\u00eda Bloise was the primary defender of the Secretariado Femenino at the 1970 PSOE Congress. She believed that without it, it would be hard for women to become involved with and have their issues taking seriously within the socialist movement.  Despite her opposition, PSOE dissolved the  Secretariado Femenino.

At the same time, MDM-MLM also challenged traditional patriarchal left wing views on women.  They were also attacked by the right for being communists, anti-woman and anti-regime.  The group faced internal divisions on whether they needed male activists to achieve women's political goals, or whether they should remain sex segregated so as to challenge patriarchal beliefs.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nThe high profile quarrels among leftist women and increasingly involvement of male dominated political organizations led to the creation in the 1970s of third-wave radical feminism in Spain, that was both similar and notably dissimilar to their American counterparts of the same name by being more explicitly socialist and politically focused on class in their orientation.

These women were opposed to Article 15, which said that \"everyone has the right to life\" ({{Lang-es|todos tienen derecho a la vida}}) as they felt it could be interpreted as offering protection to fetuses.

This resulted in a dilution of women's priorities and angered many women's rights advocates and feminists, serving to splinter these groups along ideological priority based grounds that saw one side view participation in the constitutional draft process as being part of emancipated citizenship while another faction saw it as oppressed women being forced to participate in their own repression. Radical feminists opposed to UCD felt vindicated in their doubts following the 1979 general elections, which saw 21 women or 6 percent of the 350 seats belonging to women, down from 22 in the previous congress.  At the same time, UCD continued to be the largest political organization for women with the most representation of any party in Congress, with 11 women deputies and 4 women senators.  In contrast, PSOE refused to address women's issues more broadly and to prioritize women's concerns.
