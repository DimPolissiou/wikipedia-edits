Like its predecessor, ''Gauntlet II'' is a [[fantasy]]-themed top down [[dungeon crawl]]er game and was released as a dedicated cabinet, as well as a conversion kit, both available in 2-player and 4-player versions.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:ARC Gauntlet_II.png|thumb|left|Arcade screenshot]]\n\n''Gauntlet II'' is essentially an expanded version of the original ''[[Gauntlet (1985 video game)#Gameplay|Gauntlet]]''. Like in the original game, there are four character classes to play as, with the choices being Warrior, Valkyrie, Wizard and Elf. The main difference from the original game is that multiple players can now choose to play as the same character class. Because of this each player is now distinguished by the palette of their character, with red and blue being in all versions of the game, while yellow and green are featured in the 4-player version. New voice samples were added in ''Gauntlet II'', identifying each player by their color and class (e.g. \"Yellow Elf\", \"Red Wizard\").\n\nNew level designs were added, including the possibility of encountering them in altered ways by having the play-field turned in steps of 90\u00b0. Other new features include the enemy \"It\", which upon contact made a player \"It\" and drew all enemies towards them. The only way to release this curse is by [[Tag (game)|touching another player]] or entering the exit, turning any level containing \"It\" into a fantasy filled game of tag. Other notable additions include the ability to ricochet shots off walls by means of a special [[power-up|pick-up]], acid puddles that caused large, predetermined amounts of damage and a large dragon which occupied multiple squares and required multiple hits to destroy.<ref name=ahistory/>\n\nNew level elements were also added, adding more variety to the original game. These included \"all walls are invisible\", \"magic walls\" which changed into monsters or items when hit, \"stun tiles\" which stunned the player, and fake exits.\n\nAnother challenge in the game is the possibility to find a \"secret room\". This can be found by completing specific achievements within the level (e.g., \"don't be fooled\", means that you must find the real exit first). The secret room contains items such as food and magic potions (extra shot power, extra shot speed, extra magic power, extra speed, extra armor and extra fight power).\n\n==Development==\nShortly after the release of the original ''Gauntlet'', until March 31, 1986, Atari Games held a contest where players submitted level designs, game ideas, and other suggestions for a potential ''Gauntlet'' sequel.<ref name=agpc1>{{cite magazine|magazine=Atari Games Players Journal|title=Gauntlet Maze Design Contest|date=January 1986|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://www.atarimania.com/mags/pdf/atari-games-players-club-vol-01-number-01.pdf}}</ref><ref name=cashbox>{{cite magazine|magazine=Cash Box|title='Gauntlet' Contest Announced|date=February 1, 1986|url=https://archive.org/details/cashbox49unse_31/page/38}}</ref> The winners of the contest were announced in the April 1986 issue of Atari Games' newsletter,<ref name=agpc2>{{cite magazine|magazine=Atari Games Players Journal|title=Gauntlet Maze Design Contest|date=April 1986|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://www.atarimania.com/mags/pdf/atari-games-players-club-vol-01-number-02.pdf}}</ref> and the developers implemented some of those submissions in ''Gauntlet II''. During the release of ''Gauntlet II'', Atari Games held a second contest where players were tasked to find the secret rooms in the game itself.

Like its predecessor, ''Gauntlet II'' is a [[fantasy]]-themed top down [[dungeon crawl]]er game and was released as a dedicated cabinet, as well as a conversion kit, both available in 2-player and 4-player versions.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:ARC Gauntlet_II.png|thumb|left|Arcade screenshot]]\n\n''Gauntlet II'' is essentially an expanded version of the original ''[[Gauntlet (1985 video game)#Gameplay|Gauntlet]]''. Like in the original game, there are four character classes to play as, with the choices being Warrior, Valkyrie, Wizard and Elf. The main difference from the original game is that multiple players can now choose to play as the same character class. Because of this each player is now distinguished by the palette of their character, with red and blue being in all versions of the game, while yellow and green are featured in the 4-player version. New voice samples were added in ''Gauntlet II'', identifying each player by their color and class (e.g. \"Yellow Elf\", \"Red Wizard\").\n\nNew level designs were added, including the possibility of encountering them in altered ways by having the play-field turned in steps of 90\u00b0. Other new features include the enemy \"It\", which upon contact made a player \"It\" and drew all enemies towards them. The only way to release this curse is by [[Tag (game)|touching another player]] or entering the exit, turning any level containing \"It\" into a fantasy filled game of tag. Other notable additions include the ability to ricochet shots off walls by means of a special [[power-up|pick-up]], acid puddles that caused large, predetermined amounts of damage and a large dragon which occupied multiple squares and required multiple hits to destroy.<ref name=ahistory/>\n\nNew level elements were also added, adding more variety to the original game. These included \"all walls are invisible\", \"magic walls\" which changed into monsters or items when hit, \"stun tiles\" which stunned the player, and fake exits.\n\nAnother challenge in the game is the possibility to find a \"secret room\". This can be found by completing specific achievements within the level (e.g., \"don't be fooled\", means that you must find the real exit first). The secret room contains items such as food and magic potions (extra shot power, extra shot speed, extra magic power, extra speed, extra armor and extra fight power).\n\n==Development==\nShortly after the release of the original ''Gauntlet'', until March 31, 1986, Atari Games held a contest where players submitted level designs, game ideas, and other suggestions for a potential ''Gauntlet'' sequel.<ref name=agpc1>{{cite magazine|magazine=Atari Games Players Journal|title=Gauntlet Maze Design Contest|date=January 1986|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://www.atarimania.com/mags/pdf/atari-games-players-club-vol-01-number-01.pdf}}</ref><ref name=cashbox>{{cite magazine|magazine=Cash Box|title='Gauntlet' Contest Announced|date=February 1, 1986|url=https://archive.org/details/cashbox49unse_31/page/38}}</ref> The winners of the contest were announced in the April 1986 issue of Atari Games' newsletter,<ref name=agpc2>{{cite magazine|magazine=Atari Games Players Journal|title=Gauntlet Maze Design Contest|date=April 1986|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://www.atarimania.com/mags/pdf/atari-games-players-club-vol-01-number-02.pdf}}</ref> and the developers implemented some of those submissions in ''Gauntlet II''.

{"title_page": "Reversible lane", "text_new": "[[Image:Lions Gate.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The south end of [[Lions Gate Bridge]] in [[Vancouver]], Canada]]\n\nA '''reversible lane''' ([[British English]]: '''tidal flow''') is a lane in which traffic may travel in either direction, depending on certain conditions. Typically, it is meant to improve [[traffic flow]] during rush hours, by having overhead [[traffic light]]s and lighted [[street sign]]s notify [[driving|driver]]s which lanes are open or closed to driving or turning.\n\nReversible lanes are also commonly found in tunnels and on bridges, and on the surrounding roadways \u2013 even where the lanes are not regularly reversed to handle normal changes in traffic flow.  The presence of lane controls allows authorities to close or reverse lanes when unusual circumstances (such as construction or a traffic mishap) require use of fewer or more lanes to maintain orderly flow of traffic.\n\n==Separation of flows==\nSome more recent implementations of reversible lanes use a [[Barrier transfer machine|movable barrier]] to establish a physical separation between allowed and disallowed lanes of travel. In some systems, a concrete barrier is moved during low-traffic periods to switch a central lane from one side of the road to another; some examples are the five-lane [[San Diego\u2013Coronado Bridge|San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge]] in [[San Diego, California]], the former seven-lane [[Tappan Zee Bridge (1955\u20132017)|Tappan Zee Bridge]] on the [[Hudson River]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] and the eight-lane [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]] across the [[Waitemat\u0101 Harbour]] in [[Auckland]], New Zealand. Other systems use retractable cones or [[bollard]]s which are built into the road, or retractable fences which can divert traffic from a reversible ramp.  The two center lanes of the six-lane [[Golden Gate Bridge]] are reversible; they are southbound during morning rush hour and northbound at evening rush hour.  Prior to the installation of a movable median barrier in January 2015, they were demarcated by vertical yellow markers placed manually in sockets in the roadway.\n\nMany urban freeways have entirely separate carriageways (and connecting ramps) to hold reversible lanes (the reversible lanes in such a configuration are often referred to as \"[[express lane]]s\"). Generally, traffic flows in one direction or another in such a configuration (or not at all); the carriageways are not \"split\" into two-lane roadways during non-rush periods. Typically, this sort of express lane will have fewer interchanges than the primary lanes, and many such roadways only provide onramps for inbound traffic, and offramps for outbound traffic.\n\n==Passing lanes==\n\n[[Image:Suicide lane.svg|thumb|right|Typical{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} [[road striping|striping]] on an old-style suicide lane setup in the United States]] <!-- tagged {{fact}} because yellow centerlines were far from universal in the days when these lanes were widely used -->\n\nHistorically, the term \"suicide lane\" has also referred to a lane in the center of a highway meant for [[overtaking|passing]] in both directions.<ref>{{cite journal  |author= Richard F. Weingroff |title=How the Uncommon Became the Commonplace |journal=Public Roads |issue=January/February 2015 |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/15janfeb/04.cfm}}</ref> Neither direction has the [[Right-of-way (traffic)|right-of-way]], and both directions are permitted to use the lane for passing. In a similar layout, three lanes are striped with two in one direction and one in the other, but traffic in the direction with one lane is allowed to cross the centerline to pass.\n\n[[2+1 road]]s have replaced some of these, mainly in Europe.\n\n==Turn lanes and flush medians==\n[[File:HillsideRdCaversham.jpg|thumb|A turn lane (in New Zealand a \"flush median\") with a raised median in the forefront]]\n\n[[Image:Citystreet.svg|thumb|A typical five-lane arterial equipped with a center turn lane. These are often found in cities, towns and developed areas near cities. In the United States, the sequence line is located on the inside of the lane (sometimes with left turn arrows for both flows<ref>{{cite web|title=Google Map satellite image of West Caldwell NJ|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?q=west+caldwell+nj&ll=40.849403,-74.297318&spn=0.001176,0.001825&safe=on&hnear=West+Caldwell,+Essex,+New+Jersey&t=h&z=20|publisher=Google Maps|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}</ref> ). In Canada it is the same for all provinces with the exception of Ontario, where the sequence line is located on the outside.]]\n\nAnother type of center two-way lane is a \"two-way left turn lane\" (TWLT) or \"center left-turn lane\", or (for countries that [[drive on the right]]) \"center turn lane\" or \"median turn lane\", a single lane in the center of the road into which traffic from both directions pulls to make a left turn. While this is sometimes also called a \"suicide lane\", it is actually far safer,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/10053/ |title= Evaluation of Lane Reduction \"Road Diet\" Measures on Crashes|date= April 12, 2012 |publisher= U.S. [[Federal Highway Administration]] |accessdate= June 1, 2013}}</ref> as traffic collisions occur at far lower speeds.\n\nThese roads are very common in suburban areas and less common in rural areas, though they are frequent around developed areas near [[Interstate Highway]] bypasses in the United States. Many were divided highways before the median was demolished or otherwise replaced by the turn lane. Many four-lane streets with a center [[double yellow line#United States|double yellow line]] are being phased out in favor of 3- or five-lane streets with center turn lanes because the center lane allows for less disruption of traffic flow.<ref>3 lane roads such as this are typically created as part of a \"[[road diet]],\" with remainder of the road becoming bicycle lanes.</ref> For routes with moderate traffic, other movements involve downgrading four-lane undivided streets to three-lane streets with a turn-only center lane.\n\nThis center lane can be used by emergency vehicles like police cars, ambulance, and fire trucks to avoid traffic traveling in either direction. Drivers are not allowed to use the center lane of such a highway for passing slow-moving vehicles, except when funding or space constraints dictate use of it as a rush hour \"travel lane\" when traffic is largely asymmetric between a central business district and its suburbs. [[U.S. Route 13]] near the [[Greenville, North Carolina]], city limits is a rare instance of a posted warning sign that states \"do not pass in center lane\".\n\n==Examples==\n\n===No (or minimal) lane controls===\n\n* [[Connecticut Avenue]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=wtop>{{cite news |url=https://wtop.com/news/2011/12/when-are-area-roads-reversed/ |title=When are area roads reversed? |last=Freedman |first=Amy |date=December 30, 2011 |work=WTOP |location=Washington, DC |access-date=May 12, 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Chain Bridge (Washington, D.C.)|Chain Bridge]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=wtop/>\n* Pre-upgrade Bailey Bridge, in [[Coquitlam, British Columbia|Coquitlam, B.C.]]\n* [[M-20 (Michigan highway)|M-20]], [[Mount Pleasant, Michigan|Mount Pleasant]] to [[Midland, Michigan]] (unusual length in flat, rural terrain)\n\n===Lane controls and no (or minimal) physical separation===\n====Trans-national====\n* The [[Peace Bridge]] between the U.S. and Canada, connecting [[Fort Erie, Ontario]] to [[Buffalo, New York]].

New approach works commenced in January 2007 for the second span, at a cost of 45 million AUD, eliminating the need for a reversible lane. However, a 300-metre reversible centre lane will still remain on Alfords Point Road over Henry Lawson Drive, approximately 500 meters north of this proposed bridge.\n* General Holmes Drive generally has four north and four south lanes, but during morning peak hour one southbound lane is divided from the others with a plastic island with signs placed along the top.

The road connects the city centre with [[Gravelly Hill Interchange|Spaghetti Junction]] on the [[M6 motorway|M6]]. It is a 2-mile, 7-lane section of motorway with no central reservation, and a lower than usual speed limit of 50&nbsp;mph. Constructed in 1971, it was the United Kingdom's first contraflow road. Overhead lane control signals allow for 4 lanes in and 2 out in the morning rush hour, reversed in the evening, and 3 lanes each way at all other times. One dividing lane is closed to traffic at all times, and motorcycles are permanently prohibited from using the central, red-surfaced lane (with a fixed sign) owing to its use as an off-camber drain. The lane control signals can be set to allow travel in either direction for any lane in exceptional circumstances, which has been used for single-lane, reduced-speed running in each direction (or 2+1 with no divider) during road work, allowing the expressway to remain largely open even during major repairs. However, the 7-lane section splits at both ends to fully divided sets of 4x2 lane slip roads, with the central red lane ending in a barrier, so full use of this flexibility is uncommon and occasional overnight closure is required.\n* [[U.S. Route 78]] in [[Snellville, Georgia]], United States, has 6 lanes in total. This occurs from the [[limited-access road|limited access]] portion through [[Stone Mountain|Stone Mountain Park]] to [[Georgia State Route 124|Georgia State Route 124 (Scenic Highway)]] for several miles. The middle two lanes were reversible (usually occurring during rush hour) with a varying lane always reserved as a center turn lane; hence 3 lanes were used for one direction of travel and 2 for the other.

It comprises a total of 10 lanes distributed over 4 separate roadways (3+3+2+2), each of which can be reversed. Traffic flow is unidirectional on up to three roadways at a time, in different combinations, depending on demand. Since this highway system is the only quick route from [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] to the beach, the majority of the traffic on Fridays and Sundays are cars on weekend trips, creating highly asymmetrical demand.\n* In [[Washington, D.C.]], the [[Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway]] between the [[Lincoln Memorial]] and Calvert St. is converted from two lanes in each direction to one-way southbound in the morning and one-way northbound in the evening rush hour Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays. The P Street exit, usually unavailable northbound, is an allowed left exit in the evening.

In the early hours one of the tubes will be closed, and one of the lanes in the other tube carries reversed traffic.\n* The [[Baker\u2013Barry Tunnel]], one of only two means of access to the [[Marin Headlands]] from [[U.S. Route 101]] in [[Marin County, California]], is not wide enough to accommodate bidirectional traffic.  It consists of a single reversible lane for automobiles and two bicycle lanes.  The direction of automobile traffic alternates every five minutes, controlled by a traffic light at each end of the tunnel.  The bicycle lanes, one for each direction, are located on either side of the reversible lane; buttons on either side of the tunnel trigger flashing signs alerting drivers entering the tunnel to the presence of cyclists.<ref>[http://www.walkbikemarin.org/news.php?id=50 Innovations in Marin County: The Baker-Barry Tunnel]</ref>\n\n===Entire roadway formerly reversed===\n* The [[Southern Expressway (Australia)|Southern Expressway]] in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]], was the world's longest exclusively one-way reversible road. It opened in 1997 and eventually traversed {{convert|21|km}} though the city's southern suburbs, until its duplication to carry two-way traffic completed in 2014. It changed direction to carry peak hour traffic to the city centre in the morning and away from the city in the evening. On weekends, the directions were reversed.\n\n== Escalators ==\nIn shopping centres and [[rail rapid transit|metro]] stations there may be an odd number of escalators, with one or more escalators running in different directions in different time of a day.\n\n==See also==\n{{commonscat|Reversible traffic lanes}}\n* [[Barrier transfer machine]]\n* [[Contraflow lane]]\n* [[Contraflow lane reversal]]\n* [[Road diet]]\n* [[Single-track road]]\n* [[Detour|Stop-gap]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Road types}}\n\n[[Category:Road infrastructure]]\n[[Category:Road traffic management]]\n[[Category:Types of roads]]\n[[Category:Repurposing]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:Lions Gate.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The south end of [[Lions Gate Bridge]] in [[Vancouver]], Canada]]\n\nA '''reversible lane''' ([[British English]]: '''tidal flow''') is a lane in which traffic may travel in either direction, depending on certain conditions. Typically, it is meant to improve [[traffic flow]] during rush hours, by having overhead [[traffic light]]s and lighted [[street sign]]s notify [[driving|driver]]s which lanes are open or closed to driving or turning.\n\nReversible lanes are also commonly found in tunnels and on bridges, and on the surrounding roadways \u2013 even where the lanes are not regularly reversed to handle normal changes in traffic flow.  The presence of lane controls allows authorities to close or reverse lanes when unusual circumstances (such as construction or a traffic mishap) require use of fewer or more lanes to maintain orderly flow of traffic.\n\n==Separation of flows==\nSome more recent implementations of reversible lanes use a [[Barrier transfer machine|movable barrier]] to establish a physical separation between allowed and disallowed lanes of travel. In some systems, a concrete barrier is moved during low-traffic periods to switch a central lane from one side of the road to another; some examples are the five-lane [[San Diego\u2013Coronado Bridge|San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge]] in [[San Diego, California]], the former seven-lane [[Tappan Zee Bridge (1955\u20132017)|Tappan Zee Bridge]] on the [[Hudson River]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] and the eight-lane [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]] across the [[Waitemat\u0101 Harbour]] in [[Auckland]], New Zealand. Other systems use retractable cones or [[bollard]]s which are built into the road, or retractable fences which can divert traffic from a reversible ramp.  The two center lanes of the six-lane [[Golden Gate Bridge]] are reversible; they are southbound during morning rush hour and northbound at evening rush hour.  Prior to the installation of a movable median barrier in January 2015, they were demarcated by vertical yellow markers placed manually in sockets in the roadway.\n\nMany urban freeways have entirely separate carriageways (and connecting ramps) to hold reversible lanes (the reversible lanes in such a configuration are often referred to as \"[[express lane]]s\"). Generally, traffic flows in one direction or another in such a configuration (or not at all); the carriageways are not \"split\" into two-lane roadways during non-rush periods. Typically, this sort of express lane will have fewer interchanges than the primary lanes, and many such roadways only provide onramps for inbound traffic, and offramps for outbound traffic.\n\n==Passing lanes==\n\n[[Image:Suicide lane.svg|thumb|right|Typical{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} [[road striping|striping]] on an old-style suicide lane setup in the United States]] <!-- tagged {{fact}} because yellow centerlines were far from universal in the days when these lanes were widely used -->\n\nHistorically, the term \"suicide lane\" has also referred to a lane in the center of a highway meant for [[overtaking|passing]] in both directions.<ref>{{cite journal  |author= Richard F.

In a similar layout, three lanes are striped with two in one direction and one in the other, but traffic in the direction with one lane is allowed to cross the centerline to pass.\n\n[[2+1 road]]s have replaced some of these, mainly in Europe.\n\n==Turn lanes and flush medians==\n[[File:HillsideRdCaversham.jpg|thumb|A turn lane (in New Zealand a \"flush median\") with a raised median in the forefront]]\n\n[[Image:Citystreet.svg|thumb|A typical five-lane arterial equipped with a center turn lane.

In Canada it is the same for all provinces with the exception of Ontario, where the sequence line is located on the outside.]]\n\nAnother type of center two-way lane is a \"two-way left turn lane\" (TWLT) or \"center left-turn lane\", or (for countries that [[drive on the right]]) \"center turn lane\" or \"median turn lane\", a single lane in the center of the road into which traffic from both directions pulls to make a left turn.

Many were divided highways before the median was demolished or otherwise replaced by the turn lane. Many four-lane streets with a center [[double yellow line#United States|double yellow line]] are being phased out in favor of 3- or five-lane streets with center turn lanes because the center lane allows for less disruption of traffic flow.<ref>3 lane roads such as this are typically created as part of a \"[[road diet]],\" with remainder of the road becoming bicycle lanes.</ref> For routes with moderate traffic, other movements involve downgrading four-lane undivided streets to three-lane streets with a turn-only center lane.\n\nThis center lane can be used by emergency vehicles like police cars, ambulance, and fire trucks to avoid traffic traveling in either direction. Drivers are not allowed to use the center lane of such a highway for passing slow-moving vehicles, except when funding or space constraints dictate use of it as a rush hour \"travel lane\" when traffic is largely asymmetric between a central business district and its suburbs. [[U.S. Route 13]] near the [[Greenville, North Carolina]], city limits is a rare instance of a posted warning sign that states \"do not pass in center lane\".\n\n==Examples==\n\n===No (or minimal) lane controls===\n\n* [[Connecticut Avenue]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=wtop>{{cite news |url=https://wtop.com/news/2011/12/when-are-area-roads-reversed/ |title=When are area roads reversed? |last=Freedman |first=Amy |date=December 30, 2011 |work=WTOP |location=Washington, DC |access-date=May 12, 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Chain Bridge (Washington, D.C.)|Chain Bridge]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=wtop/>\n* Pre-upgrade Bailey Bridge, in [[Coquitlam, British Columbia|Coquitlam, B.C.]]\n* [[M-20 (Michigan highway)|M-20]], [[Mount Pleasant, Michigan|Mount Pleasant]] to [[Midland, Michigan]] (unusual length in flat, rural terrain)\n\n===Lane controls and no (or minimal) physical separation===\n====Trans-national====\n* The [[Peace Bridge]] between the U.S. and Canada, connecting [[Fort Erie, Ontario]] to [[Buffalo, New York]].

During morning rush hour, as well as the hours before [[Kentucky Wildcats football|UK football]] [[Kroger Field|home]] games, southbound traffic (away from the UK campus and downtown) is restricted to one lane between campus and Southland Drive, and two lanes from Southland to New Circle. Northbound traffic faces the same restrictions in the evening rush hour and immediately after football games. During off-peak hours, an equal number of lanes are dedicated to traffic in each direction. One dedicated left-turn lane is always provided regardless of the current traffic configuration.\n* Baxter Avenue and Bardstown Road ([[U.S. Highway 31E]]) in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] have reversible lanes (lane signals without any physical separation) for 2\u00bd miles through [[The Highlands, Louisville|The Highlands]], starting at their intersection with Lexington Road in the north and ending at Douglass Boulevard in the south. This stretch of road has four lanes, but on-street parking frequently restricts traffic to one lane in each direction outside of rush hours. During rush hours, parking is prohibited north of Douglass Boulevard. Southbound traffic leaving [[downtown Louisville]] is restricted to one lane during the morning rush hour, with northbound traffic having the same restriction during the evening rush hour.

This is the truck route for [[Newport News Shipbuilding]].\n\n===Lane controls and physical separation===\n* The [[A38(M) motorway]] (also known as the Aston Expressway) in [[Birmingham]], [[England]]. The road connects the city centre with [[Gravelly Hill Interchange|Spaghetti Junction]] on the [[M6 motorway|M6]]. It is a 2-mile, 7-lane section of motorway with no central reservation, and a lower than usual speed limit of 50&nbsp;mph. Constructed in 1971, it was the United Kingdom's first contraflow road. Overhead lane control signals allow for 4 lanes in and 2 out in the morning rush hour, reversed in the evening, and 3 lanes each way at all other times. One dividing lane is closed to traffic at all times, and motorcycles are permanently prohibited from using the central, red-surfaced lane (with a fixed sign) owing to its use as an off-camber drain. The lane control signals can be set to allow travel in either direction for any lane in exceptional circumstances, which has been used for single-lane, reduced-speed running in each direction (or 2+1 with no divider) during road work, allowing the expressway to remain largely open even during major repairs. However, the 7-lane section splits at both ends to fully divided sets of 4x2 lane slip roads, with the central red lane ending in a barrier, so full use of this flexibility is uncommon and occasional overnight closure is required.\n* [[U.S. Route 78]] in [[Snellville, Georgia]], United States, has 6 lanes in total. This occurs from the [[limited-access road|limited access]] portion through [[Stone Mountain|Stone Mountain Park]] to [[Georgia State Route 124|Georgia State Route 124 (Scenic Highway)]] for several miles. The middle two lanes were reversible (usually occurring during rush hour) with a varying lane always reserved as a center turn lane; hence 3 lanes were used for one direction of travel and 2 for the other.

It consists of a single reversible lane for automobiles and two bicycle lanes.  The direction of automobile traffic alternates every five minutes, controlled by a traffic light at each end of the tunnel.  The bicycle lanes, one for each direction, are located on either side of the reversible lane; buttons on either side of the tunnel trigger flashing signs alerting drivers entering the tunnel to the presence of cyclists.<ref>[http://www.walkbikemarin.org/news.php?id=50 Innovations in Marin County: The Baker-Barry Tunnel]</ref>\n\n===Entire roadway formerly reversed===\n* The [[Southern Expressway (Australia)|Southern Expressway]] in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]], was the world's longest exclusively one-way reversible road.

The story is set in the mid-18th century during the [[Seven Years' War]], and follows [[Shay Patrick Cormac]], an Assassin-turned-Templar who hunts down former members of his Brotherhood after being betrayed by them. Gameplay in ''Rogue'' is very similar to that of ''Black Flag'' with a mixture of ship-based naval exploration and [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person]] land-based exploration with some new features.\n\nUpon release, ''Rogue'' received a mixed reception; while most critics praised the game's twist on the traditional formula by playing as a Templar, the mature story-line, the complex protagonist, the sophisticated depiction of the fight between [[Templars]] and [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], as well as the additions to the franchise's lore and the naval warfare gameplay, other reviewers criticized it for failing to innovate the series' formula and its similarities to ''Black Flag''. Despite this, the game is recognized as one of the best titles in the series in terms of story and atmosphere.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Assassin's Creed Rogue'' is an [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]], [[Stealth game|stealth]] game set in an [[open world]] environment and played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]]. Naval aspects from previous games return with the player controlling Shay's ship, the ''Morrigan''.

The air rifle can be outfitted with a variety of different projectiles, such as firecrackers. The player can also use it as a [[grenade launcher]], which fires off shrapnel grenades and other loads.<ref name=\"ShayProfile\" /> Hand-to-hand combat has been slightly altered, and now enemy attacks can be countered with timing, similar to the ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' series of games. Enemy Assassins feature archetypes similar to previous games, using skills that players have been using throughout the series; they can hide in bushes, blend in with crowds, and perform air assassinations against the player.<ref name=\"IGNHandsOn\" /> Poison gas can now be used as an environmental weapon, and Shay has a [[Gas mask|mask]] that can mitigate its effects.\n\nSide missions and activities return, with a number of them based on those of the previous games. Reflecting Shay's role as a Templar, the game introduces a new side mission: Assassin Interception. These mirror the Assassination side missions in previous games, in that Shay, after intercepting a messenger pigeon carrying an assassination contract, must prevent an innocent being assassinated by finding and killing Assassins hidden nearby.\n\nLegendary ship battles make a return as well. In order to overcome these challenges, the player may acquire possible upgrades for the ''Morrigan'' as the game progresses.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Shay Patrick Cormac]] (Steven Piovesan) is a new recruit to the Colonial Brotherhood of [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]] whose potential is offset by his [[insubordination]]. While training with the North Atlantic chapter under the Assassin Mentor Achilles Davenport ([[Roger Aaron Brown]]), he encounters the Assassin [[Ad\u00e9wal\u00e9]] (Tristan D. Lalla), who brings news that the Haitian city of [[Port-au-Prince]] has been devastated by an earthquake during the search for a Precursor temple containing a Piece of Eden. With his experience captaining ships\u2014including the recently acquired ''Morrigan''\u2014Cormac is enlisted in an investigation into Templar interests in a Precursor artifact and manuscript that are linked to the temple.\n\nPosing as a Templar courier, he delivers the artifact and manuscript to [[Benjamin Franklin]] (Rick Jones) whose experiments with electricity on the artifact generate a map showing the location of Precursor temples around the world. He identifies one in [[Lisbon]], and Cormac is dispatched by Davenport to retrieve the Piece of Eden it contains. However, Cormac has begun questioning the Assassins' motives after seeing their refusal to engage in dialogue with the Templars, and being asked to kill an already-dying Templar commander, [[Lawrence Washington (1718\u20131752)|Lawrence Washington]]. His convictions are destroyed in Lisbon when his efforts to retrieve the Piece of Eden trigger [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|a massive earthquake]], destroying the city. Correctly deducing that a similar sequence of events destroyed Port-au-Prince, Cormac is horrified to learn that Davenport intends to continue the search for Pieces of Eden despite the danger. Shay then steals the manuscript and attempts to escape the Homestead, but is cornered by members of the Brotherhood. Intending to commit suicide by jumping off the Homestead's cliff, Shay is shot and left for dead before he can destroy the Manuscript.\n\nNow that he is cast adrift, he finds himself in [[New York City]], acting as a vigilante to clean out gangs that are extorting the citizenry. His efforts attract the attention of Colonel [[George Monro (British Army officer)|George Monro]] (Graham J. Cuthbertson), who convinces Cormac that he can improve the lives of others. Meeting with Christopher Gist, Shay retakes his ship the ''Morrigan'' from the Assassins, and agrees to assist his new allies, despite learning that they are Templars. He is disturbed to learn that the Assassins have not given up their search for the Pieces of Eden, and believing them to be a threat, commits himself to the Templar Order to hunt them down. After killing Colonial Brotherhood Assassins Le Chasseur (Chimwemwe Miller) and Kesegowaase (Danny Blanco-Hall), Shay becomes a fully fledged member of the Order when he is inducted by Grand Master Haytham Kenway (Adrian Hough). Shay then eliminates Ad\u00e9wal\u00e9, Hope Jensen ([[Patricia Summersett]]) and [[Louis-Joseph Gaultier de La V\u00e9rendrye]] (Marcel Jeannin). Finally, only two senior members of the Assassins in America remain alive: Achilles himself, and his second-in-command Liam O'Brien (Julian Casey), once Shay's best friend. Shay pursues the two to the Arctic with Haytham, where the Assassins have located another Temple. Having dispatched most of the Assassin expedition, Shay and Haytham enter the Temple to find Liam and Achilles, who have realized that the artifact is as Shay said\u2014a means to stabilize the world, not a weapon to control it. However, Achilles' attempt to stop Liam taking vengeance causes the artifact to be destroyed, and a third earthquake is triggered. As the four try to escape, Shay and Liam duel on the ice and Liam is fatally injured when the two fall. Shay then makes his way back to his ship and arrives as Haytham overpowers Achilles. Shay persuades Haytham to spare Achilles, out of mercy and to ensure knowledge of the Temples will not be lost, so the Assassins will not try to pursue them again. Haytham then cripples the last American Assassin with his pistol.\n\nAs the Templars set sail for home, Haytham tasks Shay with retrieving the Precursor artifact. Shay spends much of his later life hunting it down, even as Templar influence in the colonies was eventually destroyed by [[Assassin's Creed III|Connor]] during the [[American Revolution]]. The final memories gradually reveal a mission to escort Benjamin Franklin through Paris, in search of the Precursor box that is in the possession of Charles Dorian, a French Assassin and the father of Arno Dorian, the protagonist of ''[[Assassin's Creed Unity]]''. Cormac murders Dorian and takes possession of the box as he becomes a senior member of the Templar Order.\n\nIn the present day, the player is researching Cormac's memories for Abstergo Entertainment when they inadvertently trip a hidden memory file that infects the Animus servers. Abstergo is placed in lockdown, and the player must clean the Animus servers out by living Cormac's later memories. Juhani Otso Berg, a senior member of the Templars, later orders the player to upload Shay's memories to the Assassin servers in order to weaken their resolve by showing how close Achilles Davenport came to destroying the world and the Assassins betraying Shay. The Brotherhood responds by cutting off their communications. In a mid-credits scene, Berg thanks the player for their help, and gives them a choice: join the Templar order, or die. The scene fades to black before the player's decision is shown.\n\n==Development==\nBy March 2014, an ''Assassin's Creed'' game code-named \"Comet\" was revealed to be in development, set for release on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/leaked-images-reveal-one-of-this-falls-two-assassins-1547111652|title=Leaked Images Reveal One Of This Fall's Two Assassin's Creed Games|last=Schreier|first=Jason|publisher=Kotaku|date=March 19, 2014|accessdate=March 19, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319222143/http://kotaku.com/leaked-images-reveal-one-of-this-falls-two-assassins-1547111652|archive-date=March 19, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> By the end of the month, additional reports indicated that \"Comet\" would be set around 1758 in New York, as well as feature sailing on the Atlantic Ocean. The game would be a direct sequel to ''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag'', and would feature a Templar named Shay as the main protagonist. Haytham Kenway from ''Assassin's Creed III'' and [[Ad\u00e9wal\u00e9]] from ''Black Flag'' would also make appearances.<ref>{{cite

weapons introduced, new mission design, which requires players to prevent assassinations instead of carrying out assassinations like in other ''Assassin's Creed'' titles, as well as advanced and improved combat mechanics. However, he criticized poor pacing of the story, frequent bugs, lack of replayability and the lack of inclusion of a multiplayer mode. He concluded the review by saying that \"''Rogue'' is a far more pleasurable experience than I anticipated. It does just enough to put its own stamp on the franchise while also giving us critical story details in order to tie up loose ends between ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'' and ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag|IV]]''. It serves as a perfect conclusion to the series' time spent exploring Europe's North American colonies in the 18th century.\"<ref name=\"EGM\"/>\n\n''[[Eurogamer]]'' drew comparisons between ''Rogue'' and ''[[Assassin's Creed Revelations]]''\u2014a game which served to resolve storylines from Ezio Auditore's saga as a lead-in to ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'', due to its focus on expanding on characters and storylines introduced in ''III'' and ''Black Flag''. Although noting that some settings, weapons, and mechanics had been reused from previous games in the series (such as an expansion of the New York City setting from ''III'', naval combat, renovating buildings to build income, and locating enemies with a radar similar to the former multiplayer mode), the use of Assassins as an enemy was considered to be a \"much-needed new [idea] to the series' fighting mechanics\" due to their use of tactics that were used by the player themselves in previous games (such as smoke bombs and hiding), and that ''Rogue'' felt the most \"fresh\" whilst exploring its new North Atlantic overworld. However, the story missions themselves and single player campaign overall were criticized for being noticeably shorter than in previous games.<ref name=eurogamer-review>{{cite web|title=Assassin's Creed: Rogue is more than the cash-grab it could have been|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-10-15-assassins-creed-rogue-is-more-than-the-cash-grab-it-could-have-been|website=Eurogamer|accessdate=20 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321153803/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-10-15-assassins-creed-rogue-is-more-than-the-cash-grab-it-could-have-been|archive-date=21 March 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nMatt Miller from [[Game Informer]] gave the game an 8.25/10. He praised the huge variety of activities, varied environments, and mission types, new additions and well-performed gameplay, despite being too similar to its predecessors. He criticized the repetitive melee combat and the absence of multiplayer mode. He described the game by saying that \"''Rogue'' is vast with lots to explore, and while it lacks novelty, it offers a wealth of gameplay and lore to faithful fans.\"<ref name=\"GI\"/> Daniel Bloodworth from [[GameTrailers]] gave the game a 7.2/10, praising the return of some old characters in the ''Assassin's Creed'' series, stunning scenery and environment, interesting interceptions missions, but criticizing the predictable and dull lead character, poorly-constructed missions in the beginning of the game, disappointing boss battles, as well as numerous bugs. He described the game by saying that \"''Rogue'' in many ways feels like an extension of last year's ''Black Flag'', even down to the menus, but there are some tweaks to the formula thanks to your new role as a former assassin, hunting down his old comrades.\"<ref name=\"GT\"/>\n\nDaniel Krupa from [[IGN]] gave the game a 6.8/10. He praised the engaging story, the nuanced lead character, atmospheric scenery, but criticized the lack of Templar abilities included, bland encounters with other main characters, uninspired side quests, empty world, as well as the frustrating combat and traversal system, which he stated has shown no improvements. He also criticized the game for not encouraging the player to explore the world.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Mark Walton from [[GameSpot]] gave the game a 6/10, criticizing the predictable story, unlikeable lead character, lack of interesting missions, as well as being thin on core content. He stated that the game feels like a glorified ''Black Flag'' DLC pack and has done nothing to put the franchise forward.<ref name=\"GSpot\"/> Xav de Matos from [[Joystiq]] gave the game a 6/10, criticizing the game for not adding anything new to the franchise. He stated that \"''Assassin's Creed Rogue'' is essentially a clone of ''Black Flag''{{'}}s setting and systems.

The story is set in the mid-18th century during the [[Seven Years' War]], and follows [[Shay Patrick Cormac]], an Assassin-turned-Templar who hunts down former members of his Brotherhood after being betrayed by them. Gameplay in ''Rogue'' is very similar to that of ''Black Flag'' with a mixture of ship-based naval exploration and [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person]] land-based exploration with some new features.\n\nUpon release, ''Rogue'' received a mixed reception; while most of critics praised the game's twist on the traditional formula by playing as a Templar, the mature story-line, the complex protagonist, the sophisticated depiction of the fight between [[Templars]] and [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], as well as the additions to the franchise's lore and the naval warfare gameplay, other reviewers criticized it for failing to innovate the series' formula and its similarities to ''Black Flag''. Despite this, the game is recognized as one of the best titles in the series in terms of story and atmosphere.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Assassin's Creed Rogue'' is an [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]], [[Stealth game|stealth]] game set in an [[open world]] environment and played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]]. Naval aspects from previous games return with the player controlling Shay's ship, the ''Morrigan''. The ''Morrigan'' has a [[Draft (hull)|shallower draft]] compared to Edward Kenway's ''Jackdaw'' from ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]'', allowing for river travel.<ref name=\"Polygon1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/5/5971421/assassins-creed-rogue-trailer-confirmed-ubisoft|title=Assassin's Creed Rogue confirmed by Ubisoft - here's the first trailer|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|work=Polygon|date=August 5, 2014|accessdate=August 5, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806140407/http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/5/5971421/assassins-creed-rogue-trailer-confirmed-ubisoft|archive-date=August 6, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"ShayProfile\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/08/06/get-to-know-shay-from-assassins-creed-rogue.aspx|title=Get To Know Shay From Assassin's Creed Rogue|last=Cork|first=Jeff|publisher=Game Stop|work=Game Informer|date=August 6, 2014|accessdate=August 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140807182516/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/08/06/get-to-know-shay-from-assassins-creed-rogue.aspx|archive-date=August 7, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> New features include new ship-based weapons such as releasing an oil slick which can then be ignited, [[Puckle gun]]s, and the ability for enemies to board the ''Morrigan'' during ship-to-ship combat.

The air rifle can be outfitted with a variety of different projectiles, such as firecrackers. The player can also use it as a [[grenade launcher]], which fires off shrapnel grenades and other loads.<ref name=\"ShayProfile\" /> Hand-to-hand combat has been slightly altered, and now enemy attacks can be countered with timing, similar to the ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' series of games. Enemy Assassins feature archetypes similar to previous games, using skills that players have been using throughout the series; they can hide in bushes, blend in with crowds, and perform air assassinations against the player.<ref name=\"IGNHandsOn\" /> Poison gas can now be used as an environmental weapon, and Shay has a [[Gas mask|mask]] that can mitigate its effects.\n\nSide missions and activities return, with a number of them based on those of the previous games. Reflecting Shay's role as a Templar, the game introduces a new side mission: Assassin Interception. These mirror the Assassination side missions in previous games, in that Shay, after intercepting a messenger pigeon carrying an assassination contract, must prevent an innocent being assassinated by finding and killing Assassins hidden nearby.\n\nLegendary ship battles make a return as well. In order to overcome these challenges, the player may acquire possible upgrades for the ''Morrigan'' as the game progresses.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Shay Patrick Cormac]] (Steven Piovesan) is a new recruit to the Colonial Brotherhood of [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]] whose potential is offset by his [[insubordination]]. While training with the North Atlantic chapter under the Assassin Mentor Achilles Davenport ([[Roger Aaron Brown]]), he encounters the Assassin [[Ad\u00e9wal\u00e9]] (Tristan D. Lalla), who brings news that the Haitian city of [[Port-au-Prince]] has been devastated by an earthquake during the search for a Precursor temple containing a Piece of Eden. With his experience captaining ships\u2014including the recently acquired ''Morrigan''\u2014Cormac is enlisted in an investigation into Templar interests in a Precursor artifact and manuscript that are linked to the temple.\n\nPosing as a Templar courier, he delivers the artifact and manuscript to [[Benjamin Franklin]] (Rick Jones) whose experiments with electricity on the artifact generate a map showing the location of Precursor temples around the world. He identifies one in [[Lisbon]], and Cormac is dispatched by Davenport to retrieve the Piece of Eden it contains. However, Cormac has begun questioning the Assassins' motives after seeing their refusal to engage in dialogue with the Templars, and being asked to kill an already-dying Templar commander, [[Lawrence Washington (1718\u20131752)|Lawrence Washington]]. His convictions are destroyed in Lisbon when his efforts to retrieve the Piece of Eden trigger [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|a massive earthquake]], destroying the city. Correctly deducing that a similar sequence of events destroyed Port-au-Prince, Cormac is horrified to learn that Davenport intends to continue the search for Pieces of Eden despite the danger. Shay then steals the manuscript and attempts to escape the Homestead, but is cornered by members of the Brotherhood. Intending to commit suicide by jumping off the Homestead's cliff, Shay is shot and left for dead before he can destroy the Manuscript.\n\nNow that he is cast adrift, he finds himself in [[New York City]], acting as a vigilante to clean out gangs that are extorting the citizenry. His efforts attract the attention of Colonel [[George Monro (British Army officer)|George Monro]] (Graham J. Cuthbertson), who convinces Cormac that he can improve the lives of others. Meeting with Christopher Gist, Shay retakes his ship the ''Morrigan'' from the Assassins, and agrees to assist his new allies, despite learning that they are Templars. He is disturbed to learn that the Assassins have not given up their search for the Pieces of Eden, and believing them to be a threat, commits himself to the Templar Order to hunt them down. After killing Colonial Brotherhood Assassins Le Chasseur (Chimwemwe Miller) and Kesegowaase (Danny Blanco-Hall), Shay becomes a fully fledged member of the Order when he is inducted by Grand Master Haytham Kenway (Adrian Hough). Shay then eliminates Ad\u00e9wal\u00e9, Hope Jensen ([[Patricia Summersett]]) and [[Louis-Joseph Gaultier de La V\u00e9rendrye]] (Marcel Jeannin). Finally, only two senior members of the Assassins in America remain alive: Achilles himself, and his second-in-command Liam O'Brien (Julian Casey), once Shay's best friend. Shay pursues the two to the Arctic with Haytham, where the Assassins have located another Temple. Having dispatched most of the Assassin expedition, Shay and Haytham enter the Temple to find Liam and Achilles, who have realized that the artifact is as Shay said\u2014a means to stabilize the world, not a weapon to control it. However, Achilles' attempt to stop Liam taking vengeance causes the artifact to be destroyed, and a third earthquake is triggered. As the four try to escape, Shay and Liam duel on the ice and Liam is fatally injured when the two fall. Shay then makes his way back to his ship and arrives as Haytham overpowers Achilles. Shay persuades Haytham to spare Achilles, out of mercy and to ensure knowledge of the Temples will not be lost, so the Assassins will not try to pursue them again. Haytham then cripples the last American Assassin with his pistol.\n\nAs the Templars set sail for home, Haytham tasks Shay with retrieving the Precursor artifact. Shay spends much of his later life hunting it down, even as Templar influence in the colonies was eventually destroyed by [[Assassin's Creed III|Connor]] during the [[American Revolution]]. The final memories gradually reveal a mission to escort Benjamin Franklin through Paris, in search of the Precursor box that is in the possession of Charles Dorian, a French Assassin and the father of Arno Dorian, the protagonist of ''[[Assassin's Creed Unity]]''. Cormac murders Dorian and takes possession of the box as he becomes a senior member of the Templar Order.\n\nIn the present day, the player is researching Cormac's memories for Abstergo Entertainment when they inadvertently trip a hidden memory file that infects the Animus servers. Abstergo is placed in lockdown, and the player must clean the Animus servers out by living Cormac's later memories. Juhani Otso Berg, a senior member of the Templars, later orders the player to upload Shay's memories to the Assassin servers in order to weaken their resolve by showing how close Achilles Davenport came to destroying the world and the Assassins betraying Shay. The Brotherhood responds by cutting off their communications. In a mid-credits scene, Berg thanks the player for their help, and gives them a choice: join the Templar order, or die. The scene fades to black before the player's decision is shown.\n\n==Development==\nBy March 2014, an ''Assassin's Creed'' game code-named \"Comet\" was revealed to be in development, set for release on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/leaked-images-reveal-one-of-this-falls-two-assassins-1547111652|title=Leaked Images Reveal One Of This Fall's Two Assassin's Creed Games|last=Schreier|first=Jason|publisher=Kotaku|date=March 19, 2014|accessdate=March 19, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319222143/http://kotaku.com/leaked-images-reveal-one-of-this-falls-two-assassins-1547111652|archive-date=March 19, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> By the end of the month, additional reports indicated that \"Comet\" would be set around 1758 in New York, as well as feature sailing on the Atlantic Ocean. The game would be a direct sequel to ''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag'', and would feature a Templar named Shay as the main protagonist. Haytham Kenway from ''Assassin's Creed III'' and [[Ad\u00e9wal\u00e9]] from ''Black Flag'' would also make appearances.<ref>{{cite

weapons introduced, new mission design, which requires players to prevent assassinations instead of carrying out assassinations like in other ''Assassin's Creed'' titles, as well as advanced and improved combat mechanics. However, he criticized poor pacing of the story, frequent bugs, lack of replayability and the lack of inclusion of a multiplayer mode. He concluded the review by saying that \"''Rogue'' is a far more pleasurable experience than I anticipated. It does just enough to put its own stamp on the franchise while also giving us critical story details in order to tie up loose ends between ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'' and ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag|IV]]''. It serves as a perfect conclusion to the series' time spent exploring Europe's North American colonies in the 18th century.\"<ref name=\"EGM\"/>\n\n''[[Eurogamer]]'' drew comparisons between ''Rogue'' and ''[[Assassin's Creed Revelations]]''\u2014a game which served to resolve storylines from Ezio Auditore's saga as a lead-in to ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'', due to its focus on expanding on characters and storylines introduced in ''III'' and ''Black Flag''. Although noting that some settings, weapons, and mechanics had been reused from previous games in the series (such as an expansion of the New York City setting from ''III'', naval combat, renovating buildings to build income, and locating enemies with a radar similar to the former multiplayer mode), the use of Assassins as an enemy was considered to be a \"much-needed new [idea] to the series' fighting mechanics\" due to their use of tactics that were used by the player themselves in previous games (such as smoke bombs and hiding), and that ''Rogue'' felt the most \"fresh\" whilst exploring its new North Atlantic overworld. However, the story missions themselves and single player campaign overall were criticized for being noticeably shorter than in previous games.<ref name=eurogamer-review>{{cite web|title=Assassin's Creed: Rogue is more than the cash-grab it could have been|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-10-15-assassins-creed-rogue-is-more-than-the-cash-grab-it-could-have-been|website=Eurogamer|accessdate=20 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321153803/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-10-15-assassins-creed-rogue-is-more-than-the-cash-grab-it-could-have-been|archive-date=21 March 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nMatt Miller from [[Game Informer]] gave the game an 8.25/10. He praised the huge variety of activities, varied environments, and mission types, new additions and well-performed gameplay, despite being too similar to its predecessors. He criticized the repetitive melee combat and the absence of multiplayer mode. He described the game by saying that \"''Rogue'' is vast with lots to explore, and while it lacks novelty, it offers a wealth of gameplay and lore to faithful fans.\"<ref name=\"GI\"/> Daniel Bloodworth from [[GameTrailers]] gave the game a 7.2/10, praising the return of some old characters in the ''Assassin's Creed'' series, stunning scenery and environment, interesting interceptions missions, but criticizing the predictable and dull lead character, poorly-constructed missions in the beginning of the game, disappointing boss battles, as well as numerous bugs. He described the game by saying that \"''Rogue'' in many ways feels like an extension of last year's ''Black Flag'', even down to the menus, but there are some tweaks to the formula thanks to your new role as a former assassin, hunting down his old comrades.\"<ref name=\"GT\"/>\n\nDaniel Krupa from [[IGN]] gave the game a 6.8/10. He praised the engaging story, the nuanced lead character, atmospheric scenery, but criticized the lack of Templar abilities included, bland encounters with other main characters, uninspired side quests, empty world, as well as the frustrating combat and traversal system, which he stated has shown no improvements. He also criticized the game for not encouraging the player to explore the world.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Mark Walton from [[GameSpot]] gave the game a 6/10, criticizing the predictable story, unlikeable lead character, lack of interesting missions, as well as being thin on core content. He stated that the game feels like a glorified ''Black Flag'' DLC pack and has done nothing to put the franchise forward.<ref name=\"GSpot\"/> Xav de Matos from [[Joystiq]] gave the game a 6/10, criticizing the game for not adding anything new to the franchise. He stated that \"''Assassin's Creed Rogue'' is essentially a clone of ''Black Flag''{{'}}s setting and systems.

It was revealed half a century later that SOE was complemented by a stay-behind organisation in Britain, created in extreme secrecy, to [[British anti-invasion preparations of World War II|prepare for a possible invasion by Nazi Germany]].\n\nA network of resistance fighters was formed across Britain and arms caches were established. The network was recruited, in part, from the 5th (Ski) Battalion of the [[Scots Guards]] (which had originally been formed, but was not deployed, to fight alongside [[Finland|Finnish]] forces fighting the [[Winter War|Soviet invasion of Finland]]).<ref name=\"Scots Guards\">{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.scotsguards.co.uk/history1.htm|website=Scots Guards Association|accessdate=19 June 2014}}</ref>  The network, which became known as the [[Auxiliary Units]], was headed by Major [[Colin Gubbins]] \u2013 an expert in guerrilla warfare (who would later lead SOE). The units were trained, in part, by [[Mike Calvert|\"Mad Mike\" Calvert]], a Royal Engineers officer who specialised in demolition by explosives and covert raiding operations.

Its clandestine \"cells\" were to stay behind in enemy-controlled territory and to act as [[resistance movement]]s, conducting sabotage, guerrilla warfare and assassinations.\n\nThe stay-behind armies were created with the experience and involvement of former SOE officers.<ref name=\"ETH chronology\"/> Following Giulio Andreotti's October 1990 revelations, [[John Winthrop Hackett Junior|General Sir John Hackett]], former commander-in-chief of the [[British Army on the Rhine]], declared on November 16, 1990, that a contingency plan involving \"stay behind and resistance in depth\" was drawn up after the war.

This military structure provided for significant US leverage over the secret stay-behind networks in Western Europe as the SACEUR, throughout NATO's history, has traditionally been a US General who reports to the Pentagon in Washington and is based in NATO's Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in Mons, Belgium. The ACC's duties included elaborating on the directives of the network, developing its clandestine capability, and organizing bases in Britain and the United States. In wartime, it was to plan stay-behind operations in conjunction with SHAPE. According to former CIA director [[William Colby]], it was 'a major program'.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nCoordinated by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), {the secret armies} were run by the European military [[secret service]]s in close cooperation with the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the British foreign secret service [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS, also MI6). Trained together with US [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Berets]] and British [[Special Air Service]] (SAS), these clandestine NATO soldiers, with access to underground arms caches, prepared to fight against a potential Soviet invasion and occupation of Western Europe, as well as the coming to power of communist parties. The clandestine international network covered the European NATO membership, including Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxemburg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and Turkey, as well as the neutral European countries of Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) responded to the series of accusations made by Ganser in his book regarding the CIA's involvement in Operation Gladio, by claiming that neither Ganser nor anyone else could have solid evidence supporting their accusations. At one point in his book Ganser talks about the CIA's covert action policies as being \"terrorist in nature\" and then accuses the CIA of using their \"networks for political terrorism\".

In 1978, [[William Colby]], former director of the [[CIA]], released his memoirs in which he described the setting-up of stay-behind armies in [[Scandinavia]]:<ref name=colby/>\n\n<blockquote>The situation in each Scandinavian country was different. [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]] were NATO allies, [[Sweden]] held to the neutrality that had taken her through two world wars, and [[Finland]] were required to defer in its foreign policy to the Soviet power directly on its borders. Thus, in one set of these countries the governments themselves would build their own stay-behind nets, counting on activating them from exile to carry on the struggle. These nets had to be co-ordinated with NATO's plans, their radios had to be hooked to a future exile location, and the specialised equipment had to be secured from CIA and secretly cached in snowy hideouts for later use. In other set of countries, CIA would have to do the job alone or with, at best, \"unofficial\" local help, since the politics of those governments barred them from collaborating with NATO, and any exposure would arouse immediate protest from the local Communist press, Soviet diplomats and loyal Scandinavians who hoped that neutrality or nonalignment would allow them to slip through a World War III unharmed.</blockquote>\n\n===France===\nIn 1947, Interior Minister [[\u00c9douard Depreux]] revealed the existence of a secret stay-behind army in France codenamed \"Plan Bleu\". The next year, the \"Western Union Clandestine Committee\" (WUCC) was created to coordinate secret unorthodox warfare. In 1949, the WUCC was integrated into [[NATO]], whose headquarters were established in France, under the name \"Clandestine Planning Committee\" (CPC).

The ACC's duties included elaborating on the directives of the network, developing its clandestine capability, and organizing bases in Britain and the United States.

The clandestine international network covered the European NATO membership, including Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxemburg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and Turkey, as well as the neutral European countries of Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) responded to the series of accusations made by Ganser in his book regarding the CIA's involvement in Operation Gladio, by claiming that neither Ganser nor anyone else could have solid evidence supporting their accusations. At one point in his book Ganser talks about the CIA's covert action policies as being \"terrorist in nature\" and then accuses the CIA of using their \"networks for political terrorism\". The CIA responded by noting that Daniele Ganser's sourcing is \"largely secondary\" and that Ganser himself has complained about \"not being able to find any official sources to support his charges of the CIA's or any Western European government's involvement with Gladio\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Peake|first=Hayden B.|title=Intelligence in Recent Public Literature|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol49no3/html_files/Bookshelf_11.htm#author|work=The Intelligence Officer's Bookshelf|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency}}</ref>\n\nThe existence of these clandestine NATO units remained a closely guarded secret throughout the Cold War until 1990, when the first branch of the international network was discovered in Italy.

During peacetime, the activities of the ACC \"included elaborating the directives for the network, developing its clandestine capability and organising bases in Britain and the United States.

In 1978, [[William Colby]], former director of the [[CIA]], released his memoirs in which he described the setting-up of stay-behind armies in [[Scandinavia]]:<ref name=colby/>\n\n<blockquote>The situation in each Scandinavian country was different. [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]] were NATO allies, [[Sweden]] held to the neutrality that had taken her through two world wars, and [[Finland]] were required to defer in its foreign policy to the Soviet power directly on its borders. Thus, in one set of these countries the governments themselves would build their own stay-behind nets, counting on activating them from exile to carry on the struggle. These nets had to be co-ordinated with NATO's plans, their radios had to be hooked to a future exile location, and the specialised equipment had to be secured from CIA and secretly cached in snowy hideouts for later use. In other set of countries, CIA would have to do the job alone or with, at best, \"unofficial\" local help, since the politics of those governments barred them from collaborating with NATO, and any exposure would arouse immediate protest from the local Communist press, Soviet diplomats and loyal Scandinavians who hoped that neutrality or nonalignment would allow them to slip through a World War III unharmed.</blockquote>\n\n===France===\nIn 1947, Interior Minister [[\u00c9douard Depreux]] revealed the existence of a secret stay-behind army in France codenamed \"Plan Bleu\". The next year, the \"Western Union Clandestine Committee\" (WUCC) was created to coordinate secret unorthodox warfare. In 1949, the WUCC was integrated into [[NATO]], whose headquarters were established in France, under the name \"Clandestine Planning Committee\" (CPC). In 1958, NATO founded the Allied Clandestine Committee (ACC) to coordinate secret warfare.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Global Secret and Intelligence Services I: Hidden Systems that deliver Unforgettable Customer Service|last=Duthel|first=Heinz|publisher=BoD \u2013 Books on Demand|year=2014|isbn=9783738607710|location=|pages=316}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.php.isn.ethz.ch/lory1.ethz.ch/collections/coll_gladio/chronology76c1.html?navinfo=15301|title=Secret Warfare: Operation Gladio and NATO's Stay-Behind Armies|date=October 2016|website=Parallel History Project}}</ref>\n\nThe network was supported with elements from [[Service de Documentation Ext\u00e9rieure et de Contre-Espionnage|SDECE]], and had military support from the [[11e r\u00e9giment parachutiste de choc|11th Choc regiment]].

Carlo Schmid declared to the press: \"I was shocked that something like that is at all possible,\" and said to the press he was glad to leave the \"conspirational atmosphere\" which had weighted upon him like a \"black shadow\" during the investigations.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13502168.html\n|accessdate=2008-10-28\n|title=Schwarzer Schatten\n|date=1990-12-10\n|journal=[[Der Spiegel]]\n|issue=50\n|language=German\n|pages=194b\u2013200a|ref=harv\n}}{{Verify source|date=October 2008}}</ref> Hubacher found it especially disturbing that, apart from its official mandate of organizing resistance in case of a Soviet invasion, P-26 had also a mandate to become active should the left succeed in achieving a parliamentary majority.<ref name=\"ETHConference\"/>\n\n==Daniele Ganser and the \"strategy of tension\"==\n{{Further|Strategy of tension}}\n\nSwiss historian [[Daniele Ganser]] in his 2005 book, ''NATO's Secret Armies: Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe'',<ref name=\"Ganser2\"/> accused Gladio of trying to influence policies through the means of \"[[false flag]]\" operations and a \"strategy of tension\".\nGanser alleges that on various occasions, stay-behind movements became linked to [[right-wing terrorism]], crime and attempted coups d'\u00e9tat.<ref name=\"Ganser1\"/> In ''NATO's Secret Armies'' Ganser states that Gladio units closely cooperated with NATO and the CIA and that Gladio in Italy was responsible for terrorist attacks against its own civilian population.<ref>Andreas Anton, Michael Schetsche, Michael K.

{"title_page": "Depth of noncommutative subrings", "text_new": "In [[ring theory]] and [[Frobenius algebra]] extensions, areas of mathematics, there is a notion of '''depth two  subring''' or '''depth of a Frobenius extension'''.  The notion of depth two is important in a certain  [[noncommutative Galois theory]], which generates [[Hopf algebroid]]s in place of the more classical [[Galois group]]s, whereas the notion of depth greater than two measures the defect, or distance, from being depth two in a tower of iterated endomorphism rings above the subring. A more recent definition of depth of any unital subring in any associative ring  is proposed (see below) in a paper studying the depth of a subgroup of a finite group as group algebras over a commutative ring.\n\n== Definition and first examples ==\n\nA unital subring <math> B \\subseteq A </math> has (or is) '''right depth two''' if there is a split epimorphism of natural A-B-bimodules from <math> A^n \\rightarrow A \\otimes_B A </math> for some positive integer n; by switching to natural B-A-bimodules, there is a corresponding definition of '''left depth two'''. Here we use the usual notation <math> A^n = A \\times \\ldots \\times A</math> (n times) as well as the common notion, p is a split epimorphism if there is a homomorphism q in the reverse direction such that pq = identity on the image of p. (Sometimes the subring B in A is referred to as the ring extension A over B; the theory works as well for a ring homomorphism B into A, which induces right and left B-modules structures on A.) Equivalently, the condition for left or right depth two may be given in terms of a split monomorphism of bimodules where the domains and codomains above are reversed.\n\nFor example, let A be the group algebra of a finite group G (over any commutative base ring k; see the articles on [[group theory]] and [[group ring]] for the elementary definitions). Let B be the group (sub)algebra of a normal subgroup H of index n in G with coset representatives <math>g_1,\\cdots,g_n</math>. Define a split A-B epimorphism p:<math> A^n \\rightarrow A \\otimes_B A</math> by <math> p((a_1,\\cdots,a_n)) = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i g_i^{-1} \\otimes_B g_i </math>.  It is split by the mapping <math>q: A \\otimes_B A \\rightarrow A^n </math> defined by <math> q(a \\otimes_B a') = (a \\gamma_1(a'),\\cdots,a\\gamma_n(a')) </math> where <math>\\gamma_i(g) = \\delta_{ij} g</math> for g in the coset <math> g_jH </math> (and extended linearly to a mapping A into B, a B-B-module homomorphism since H is normal in G):  the splitting condition pq = the identity on <math> A \\otimes_B A</math> is satisfied.  Thus B is right depth two in A.\n\nAs another example (perhaps more elementary than the first; see [[ring theory]] or [[module theory]] for some of the elementary notions), let A be an algebra over a commutative ring B, where B is taken to be in the center of A. Assume A is a finite projective B-module, so there are B-linear mapping <math> f_i: A \\rightarrow B </math> and elements <math> x_i \\in A </math> (i = 1,...,n) called a '''projective base''' for the B-module A if it satisfies <math> \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i f_i(a) = a</math> for all a in A.  It follows that B is left depth two in A by defining\n<math> p(a_1,\\cdots,a_n) = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\otimes_B a_i </math> with splitting map <math> q(a \\otimes_B a') = (f_1(a)a',\\cdots,f_n(a)a')</math> as the reader may verify. A similar argument naturally shows that B is right depth two in A.\n\n==Depth in relation to Hopf algebras==\n\nFor a [[Frobenius algebra]] extension A | B (such as A and B group algebras of a subgroup pair of finite index) the two one-sided conditions of depth two are equivalent, and a notion of depth n > 2 makes sense via the right endomorphism ring extension iterated to generate a tower of rings (a technical procedure beyond the scope of this survey, although the first step, the endomorphism ring theorem, is described in the section on Frobenius extension under [[Frobenius algebra]]). For example, if B is a Hopf subalgebra of a finite-dimensional [[Hopf algebra]], then B has depth two in A if and only if B is normal in A (i.e. invariant under the left and right adjoint actions of A). Since a group algebra is a Hopf algebra, the first example above illustrates the back implication of the theorem. Other examples come from the fact that finite Hopf-Galois extensions are depth two in a strong sense (the split epimorphism in the definition may be replaced by a bimodule isomorphism).\n\nLet R be a Hopf subalgebra of a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra H.  Let R\u00b0 denote the maximal ideal of elements of R having counit value 0.  Then R\u00b0H is a right ideal and coideal in H, and the quotient module Q = H/R\u00b0H is a right H-module coalgebra.  For example, if H is a group algebra, then R is a subgroup algebra of H, and one shows as an exercise that Q is isomorphic to the permutation module on the right cosets. The 2013 paper referenced below proves that the depth of R in H is determined to the nearest even value by the depth of Q as an R-module (by restriction).  The depth of Q as an R-module is defined in that paper to be the least positive integer n such that Q\u2297\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u2297Q (n times Q, tensor product of R-modules, diagonal action of R from the right) has the same constituent [[indecomposable module]]s as Q \u2297\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u2297Q (n+1 times Q) (not counting multiplicities, an entirely similar definition for depth of Q as an H-module with closely related results).   As a consequence, the depth of R in H is finite if and only if its \"generalized quotient module\" Q represents an [[algebraic element]] in the [[representation ring]] (or Green ring) of R.  This is the case for example if Q is a [[projective module]], a [[Generator (category theory)|generator]] H-module or if Q is a permutation module over a group algebra R (i.e., Q has a basis that is a [[G-set]]).\nIn case H is a Hopf algebra that is a [[semisimple algebra]], the depth of Q is the length of the descending chain of annihilator ideals in H of increasing tensor powers of Q, which stabilize on the  maximal Hopf ideal within the [[Annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] ideal, Ann Q = { h in H such that Qh = 0 } (using a 1967 theorem of Rieffel).\n\n== Depth in relation to finite-dimensional semisimple algebras and subgroups of finite groups ==\n\nIf M is the inclusion matrix (or incidence matrix of the [[Bratteli diagram]]) of finite-dimensional semisimple (complex) algebras B and A, the depth two condition on the subalgebra B in A is given by an inequality <math> MM^tM \\leq nM </math> for some positive integer n (and each corresponding entry). Denoting the left-hand side of this inequality by the power <math> M^3</math> and similarly for all powers of the inclusion matrix M, the  condition of being depth <math> m \\geq 1</math> on the subalgebra pair of semisimple algebras is: <math> M^{m+1} \\leq n M^{m-1}</math>. (Notice that if M satisfies the depth m condition, then it satisfies the depth m+1 condition.) For example, a depth one subgroup H of a finite [[Group (mathematics)|group]] G, viewed as group algebras CH in CG over the complex numbers C, satisfies the condition on the centralizer <math>G = H C_G(X) </math> for each cyclic subgroup X in H (whence normal) ; e.g. H a subgroup in the center of G, or G = H x K.  As another example, consider the group algebras <math> B = CS_2 </math> and <math> A = CS_3 </math>, the order 2 and order 6 permutation groups on three letter a,b,c where the subgroup fixes c.  The inclusion matrix may be computed in at least three ways via idempotents, via character tables or via [[Littlewood-Richardson rule]] coefficients and combinatorics of skew tableaux to be (up to permutation) the 2 by 3 matrix with top row 1,1,0 and bottow row 0,1,1, which has depth three after applying the definition.\n\nIn a 2011 article in the Journal of Algebra by R. Boltje, S. Danz and B. Kuelshammer, they provide a simplified and extended definition of the depth of any unital subring B of associative ring A to be 2n+1 if <math> A\\otimes_B \\cdots \\otimes_B A</math> (n+1 times A) is isomorphic to a direct summand in \n<math> \\oplus_{i=1}^m A \\otimes_B \\cdots \\otimes_B A</math> (n times A) as B-B-bimodules for some positive integer m; similarly, B has depth 2n in A if\nthe same condition is satisfied more strongly as A-B-bimodules (or equivalently for free Frobenius extensions, as\nB-A-bimodules).  (This definition is equivalent to an earlier notion of depth in case A is a [[Frobenius algebra]] extension of B\nwith surjective Frobenius homomorphism, for example A and B are complex semisimple algebras.) Again notice that a subring having depth m implies that it has depth m+1, so they let <math> d(B,A) </math> denote the minimal depth. They then apply this to the [[group algebra]]s of G and H over any commutative ring R.\n\nThey define a minimum combinatorial depth <math>d_c(H,G)</math> of a subgroup H of a finite group G mimicking the definition of depth of a subring but using [[G-set]]s and G-set homomorphisms instead of modules and module homomorphisms. They characterize combinatorial depth n as a condition on the number of conjugates of H intersecting in G thereby showing that combinatorial depth is finite.  In more detail, one defines an ascending chain of sets of subgroups of H starting with the zero'th stage singleton set of H, the first stage intersecting H by all its conjugate subgroups, and the n'th stage is to intersect all subgroups of H in the (n-1)'st stage by all conjugates of H. Then the combinatorial depth of H in G is 2n if the n'th stage subset is equal to the (n-1)'st stage subset.  For example, H is a normal subgroup of G if and only if H has combinatorial depth two in G. The minimum combinatorial depth follows from taking n to be minimum, and a technical definition of odd combinatorial depth. For example, <math>d_c(H,G)=1</math> if and only if <math>G=H C_G(H)</math> (i.e.,  G equals the product of H and its centralizer subgroup in G); in particular, H is normal in G.  In general, the minimum depth d(RH,RG)) is shown to be bounded by <math>d_c(H,G)</math>,  which in turn is bounded by twice the index of the normalizer of H in G.\n\n== Galois theory for depth two extensions and a Main Theorem ==\n\nMain classes of examples of depth two extensions are Galois extensions of algebras being acted upon by groups, Hopf algebras, weak Hopf algebras or [[Hopf algebroid]]s; for example, suppose a finite group G acts by automorphisms on an algebra A, then A is a depth two extension of its subalgebra B of invariants if the action is G-Galois, explained in detail in the article on [[Frobenius algebra]] extension (briefly called Frobenius extensions).\n\nConversely, any depth two extension A | B has a [[Galois]] theory based on the natural action of <math> \\mbox{End}\\, {}_BA_B </math> on A:  denoting this endomorphism ring by S, one shows S is a left bialgebroid over the centralizer R (those a in A commuting with all b in B) with a [[Galois theory]] similar to that of Hopf-Galois theory.  There is a right bialgebroid structure on the B-centralized elements T in <math> A \\otimes_B A </math> dual over R to S; certain endomorphism rings decompose as smash product, such as <math>\\mbox{End}\\, A_B \\cong   A \\otimes_R S </math>, i.e. isomorphic as rings to the smash product of the bialgebroid S (or its dual) with the ring A it acts on. Something similar is true for T and <math>\\mbox{End}\\, A \\otimes_B A_A</math> (often called a theory of duality of actions, which dates back in operator algebras to the 1970s). If A | B is in addition to being depth two a [[Frobenius algebra]] extension, the right and left endomorphism rings are anti-isomorphic, which restricts to an antipode on the bialgebroid <math> \\mbox{End}\\, {}_BA_B </math> satisfying axioms of a [[Hopf algebroid]]. There is the following relation with relative [[homological algebra]]: the relative Hochschild complex of A over B with coefficients in A, and cup product, is isomorphic as [[differential graded algebra]]s to the Amitsur complex of the R-coring S (with [[group-like element]] the identity on A; see Brzezinski-Wisbauer for the definition of the Amitsur cochain complex with product).\n\nThe Galois theory of a depth two extension is not irrelevant to a depth n > 2 Frobenius extension\nsince such a depth n extension embeds in a depth two extension in a tower of iterated endomorphism rings.  For example, given a depth three Frobenius extension of ring A over subring B, one can show that the left multiplication monomorphism <math> \\lambda: B \\rightarrow \\mbox{End}\\, A_B, \\   \\lambda(b)(a) =ba </math>  has depth two.\n\nThe main theorem in this subject is the following based on algebraic arguments in two of the articles below in [[Advances of Mathematics]] that are inspired from the field of [[operator algebra]]s, [[subfactor]]s: in particular, somewhat related to A. Ocneanu's definition of depth, his theory of paragroups, and the articles by W. Szymanski, Nikshych-Vainerman, R. Longo and others.\n\n:Main Theorem:  Suppose  an algebra A is a Frobenius extension of a subalgebra B having depth 2, a surjective Frobenius homomorphism and one-dimensional centralizer R, then A is Hopf-Galois extension of B.\n\nThe proof of this theorem is a reconstruction theorem, requiring the construction of a Hopf algebra as a minimum, but in most papers done by construction of a nondegenerate pairing of two algebras in the iterated endomorphism algebra tower above B in A, and then a very delicate check that the resulting algebra-coalgebra structure is a Hopf algebra (see for example the  article from 2001 below); the method of proof is considerably simplified by the 2003 article cited below (albeit packaged into the definition of Hopf algebroid).  The Hopf algebroid structure on the endomorphism ring S of the B-bimodule A (discussed above) becomes a Hopf algebra in the presence of the hypothesis that the centralizer <math> R = \\{ r \\in A : \\forall b \\in B, br = rb \\} </math> is one-dimensional.  The action of an endomorphism on its space of definition is shown to be a Hopf-Galois action.  The dual Hopf algebra T introduced above as well in the Hopf algebroid context and the dual left action becomes a right coaction that makes A a T-Galois extension of B.  The condition that the Frobenius homomorphism map A onto all of B is used to show that B is precisely the invariant subalgebra of the Hopf-Galois action (and not just contained within).  The condition that A be a Frobenius extension over B is not as important to the proof as the depth two hypothesis and might be avoided by imposing a progenerator module condition on A as a natural B-module.\n\n== References ==\n\n* Tomasz Brzezinski; Robert Wisbauer, ''Corings and Comodules''.

The notion of depth two is important in a certain  [[noncommutative Galois theory]], which generates [[Hopf algebroid]]s in place of the more classical [[Galois group]]s, whereas the notion of depth greater than two measures the defect, or distance, from being depth two in a tower of iterated endomorphism rings above the subring. A more recent definition of depth of any unital subring in any associative ring  is proposed (see below) in a paper studying the depth of a subgroup of a finite group as group algebras over a commutative ring.\n\n== Definition and first examples ==\n\nA unital subring <math> B \\subseteq A </math> has (or is) '''right depth two''' if there is a split epimorphism of natural A-B-bimodules from <math> A^n \\rightarrow A \\otimes_B A </math> for some positive integer n; by switching to natural B-A-bimodules, there is a corresponding definition of '''left depth two'''. Here we use the usual notation <math> A^n = A \\times \\ldots \\times A</math> (n times) as well as the common notion, p is a split epimorphism if there is a homomorphism q in the reverse direction such that pq = identity on the image of p. (Sometimes the subring B in A is referred to as the ring extension A over B; the theory works as well for a ring homomorphism B into A, which induces right and left B-modules structures on A.) Equivalently, the condition for left or right depth two may be given in terms of a split monomorphism of bimodules where the domains and codomains above are reversed.\n\nFor example, let A be the group algebra of a finite group G (over any commutative base ring k; see the articles on [[group theory]] and [[group ring]] for the elementary definitions). Let B be the group (sub)algebra of a normal subgroup H of index n in G with coset representatives <math>g_1,\\cdots,g_n</math>. Define a split A-B epimorphism p:<math> A^n \\rightarrow A \\otimes_B A</math> by <math> p((a_1,\\cdots,a_n)) = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i g_i^{-1} \\otimes_B g_i </math>.  It is split by the mapping <math>q: A \\otimes_B A \\rightarrow A^n </math> defined by <math> q(a \\otimes_B a') = (a \\gamma_1(a'),\\cdots,a\\gamma_n(a')) </math> where <math>\\gamma_i(g) = \\delta_{ij} g</math> for g in the coset <math> g_jH </math> (and extended linearly to a mapping A into B, a B-B-module homomorphism since H is normal in G):  the splitting condition pq = the identity on <math> A \\otimes_B A</math> is satisfied.  Thus B is right depth two in A.\n\nAs another example (perhaps more elementary than the first; see [[ring theory]] or [[module theory]] for some of the elementary notions), let A be an algebra over a commutative ring B, where B is taken to be in the center of A. Assume A is a finite projective B-module, so there are B-linear mapping <math> f_i: A \\rightarrow B </math> and elements <math> x_i \\in A </math> (i = 1,...,n) called a '''projective base''' for the B-module A if it satisfies <math> \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i f_i(a) = a</math> for all a in A.  It follows that B is left depth two in A by defining\n<math> p(a_1,\\cdots,a_n) = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\otimes_B a_i </math> with splitting map <math> q(a \\otimes_B a') = (f_1(a)a',\\cdots,f_n(a)a')</math> as the reader may verify. A similar argument naturally shows that B is right depth two in A.\n\n==Depth in relation to Hopf algebras==\n\nFor a [[Frobenius algebra]] extension A | B (such as A and B group algebras of a subgroup pair of finite index) the two one-sided conditions of depth two are equivalent, and a notion of depth n > 2 makes sense via the right endomorphism ring extension iterated to generate a tower of rings (a technical procedure beyond the scope of this survey, although the first step, the endomorphism ring theorem, is described in the section on Frobenius extension under [[Frobenius algebra]]). For example, if B is a Hopf subalgebra of a finite-dimensional [[Hopf algebra]], then B has depth two in A if and only if B is normal in A (i.e. invariant under the left and right adjoint actions of A). Since a group algebra is a Hopf algebra, the first example above illustrates the back implication of the theorem. Other examples come from the fact that finite Hopf-Galois extensions are depth two in a strong sense (the split epimorphism in the definition may be replaced by a bimodule isomorphism).\n\nLet R be a Hopf subalgebra of a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra H.  Let R\u00b0 denote the maximal ideal of elements of R having counit value 0.  Then R\u00b0H is a right ideal and coideal in H, and the quotient module Q = H/R\u00b0H is a right H-module coalgebra.  For example, if H is a group algebra, then R is a subgroup algebra of H, and one shows as an exercise that Q is isomorphic to the permutation module on the right cosets. The 2013 paper referenced below proves that the depth of R in H is determined to the nearest even value by the depth of Q as an R-module (by restriction).  The depth of Q as an R-module is defined in that paper to be the least positive integer n such that Q\u2297\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u2297Q (n times Q, tensor product of R-modules, diagonal action of R from the right) has the same constituent [[indecomposable module]]s as Q \u2297\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u2297Q (n+1 times Q) (not counting multiplicities, an entirely similar definition for depth of Q as an H-module with closely related results).   As a consequence, the depth of R in H is finite if and only if its \"generalized quotient module\" Q represents an [[algebraic element]] in the [[representation ring]] (or Green ring) of R.  This is the case for example if Q is a [[projective module]], a [[Generator (category theory)|generator]] H-module or if Q is a permutation module over a group algebra R (i.e., Q has a basis that is a [[G-set]]).\nIn case H is a Hopf algebra that is a [[semisimple algebra]], the depth of Q is the length of the descending chain of annihilator ideals in H of increasing tensor powers of Q, which stabilize on the  maximal Hopf ideal within the [[Annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] ideal, Ann Q = { h in H such that Qh = 0 } (using a 1967 theorem of Rieffel).\n\n== Depth in relation to finite-dimensional semisimple algebras and subgroups of finite groups ==\n\nIf M is the inclusion matrix (or incidence matrix of the [[Bratteli diagram]]) of finite-dimensional semisimple (complex) algebras B and A, the depth two condition on the subalgebra B in A is given by an inequality <math> MM^tM \\leq nM </math> for some positive integer n (and each corresponding entry). Denoting the left-hand side of this inequality by the power <math> M^3</math> and similarly for all powers of the inclusion matrix M, the  condition of being depth <math> m \\geq 1</math> on the subalgebra pair of semisimple algebras is: <math> M^{m+1} \\leq n M^{m-1}</math>. (Notice that if M satisfies the depth m condition, then it satisfies the depth m+1 condition.) For example, a depth one subgroup H of a finite [[Group (mathematics)|group]] G, viewed as group algebras CH in CG over the complex numbers C, satisfies the condition on the centralizer <math>G = H C_G(X) </math> for each cyclic subgroup X in H (whence normal) ; e.g. H a subgroup in the center of G, or G = H x K.  As another example, consider the group algebras <math> B = CS_2 </math> and <math> A = CS_3 </math>, the order 2 and order 6 permutation groups on three letter a,b,c where the subgroup fixes c.  The inclusion matrix may be computed in at least three ways via idempotents, via character tables or via [[Littlewood-Richardson rule]] coefficients and combinatorics of skew tableaux to be (up to permutation) the 2 by 3 matrix with top row 1,1,0 and bottow row 0,1,1, which has depth three after applying the definition.\n\nIn a 2011 article in the Journal of Algebra by R. Boltje, S. Danz and B. Kuelshammer, they provide a simplified and extended definition of the depth of any unital subring B of associative ring A to be 2n+1 if <math> A\\otimes_B \\cdots \\otimes_B A</math> (n+1 times A) is isomorphic to a direct summand in \n<math> \\oplus_{i=1}^m A \\otimes_B \\cdots \\otimes_B A</math> (n times A) as B-B-bimodules for some positive integer m; similarly, B has depth 2n in A if\nthe same condition is satisfied more strongly as A-B-bimodules (or equivalently for free Frobenius extensions, as\nB-A-bimodules).  (This definition is equivalent to an earlier notion of depth in case A is a [[Frobenius algebra]] extension of B\nwith surjective Frobenius homomorphism, for example A and B are complex semisimple algebras.) Again notice that a subring having depth m implies that it has depth m+1, so they let <math> d(B,A) </math> denote the minimal depth. They then apply this to the [[group algebra]]s of G and H over any commutative ring R.\n\nThey define a minimum combinatorial depth <math>d_c(H,G)</math> of a subgroup H of a finite group G mimicking the definition of depth of a subring but using [[G-set]]s and G-set homomorphisms instead of modules and module homomorphisms. They characterize combinatorial depth n as a condition on the number of conjugates of H intersecting in G thereby showing that combinatorial depth is finite.  In more detail, one defines an ascending chain of sets of subgroups of H starting with the zero'th stage singleton set of H, the first stage intersecting H by all its conjugate subgroups, and the n'th stage is to intersect all subgroups of H in the (n-1)'st stage by all conjugates of H. Then the combinatorial depth of H in G is 2n if the n'th stage subset is equal to the (n-1)'st stage subset.  For example, H is a normal subgroup of G if and only if H has combinatorial depth two in G. The minimum combinatorial depth follows from taking n to be minimum, and a technical definition of odd combinatorial depth. For example, <math>d_c(H,G)=1</math> if and only if <math>G=H C_G(H)</math> (i.e.,  G equals the product of H and its centralizer subgroup in G); in particular, H is normal in G.  In general, the minimum depth d(RH,RG)) is shown to be bounded by <math>d_c(H,G)</math>,  which in turn is bounded by twice the index of the normalizer of H in G.\n\n== Galois theory for depth two extensions and a Main Theorem ==\n\nMain classes of examples of depth two extensions are Galois extensions of algebras being acted upon by groups, Hopf algebras, weak Hopf algebras or [[Hopf algebroid]]s; for example, suppose a finite group G acts by automorphisms on an algebra A, then A is a depth two extension of its subalgebra B of invariants if the action is G-Galois, explained in detail in the article on [[Frobenius algebra]] extension (briefly called Frobenius extensions).\n\nConversely, any depth two extension A | B has a [[Galois]] theory based on the natural action of <math> \\mbox{End}\\, {}_BA_B </math> on A:  denoting this endomorphism ring by S, one shows S is a left bialgebroid over the centralizer R (those a in A commuting with all b in B) with a [[Galois theory]] similar to that of Hopf-Galois theory.  There is a right bialgebroid structure on the B-centralized elements T in <math> A \\otimes_B A </math> dual over R to S; certain endomorphism rings decompose as smash product, such as <math>\\mbox{End}\\, A_B \\cong   A \\otimes_R S </math>, i.e. isomorphic as rings to the smash product of the bialgebroid S (or its dual) with the ring A it acts on. Something similar is true for T and <math>\\mbox{End}\\, A \\otimes_B A_A</math> (often called a theory of duality of actions, which dates back in operator algebras to the 1970s). If A | B is in addition to being depth two a [[Frobenius algebra]] extension, the right and left endomorphism rings are anti-isomorphic, which restricts to an antipode on the bialgebroid <math> \\mbox{End}\\, {}_BA_B </math> satisfying axioms of a [[Hopf algebroid]]. There is the following relation with relative [[homological algebra]]: the relative Hochschild complex of A over B with coefficients in A, and cup product, is isomorphic as [[differential graded algebra]]s to the Amitsur complex of the R-coring S (with [[group-like element]] the identity on A; see Brzezinski-Wisbauer for the definition of the Amitsur cochain complex with product).\n\nThe Galois theory of a depth two extension is not irrelevant to a depth n > 2 Frobenius extension\nsince such a depth n extension embeds in a depth two extension in a tower of iterated endomorphism rings.  For example, given a depth three Frobenius extension of ring A over subring B, one can show that the left multiplication monomorphism <math> \\lambda: B \\rightarrow \\mbox{End}\\, A_B, \\   \\lambda(b)(a) =ba </math>  has depth two.\n\nThe main theorem in this subject is the following based on algebraic arguments in two of the articles below in [[Advances of Mathematics]] that are inspired from the field of [[operator algebra]]s, [[subfactor]]s: in particular, somewhat related to A. Ocneanu's definition of depth, his theory of paragroups, and the articles by W. Szymanski, Nikshych-Vainerman, R. Longo and others.\n\n Main Theorem:  Suppose  an algebra A is a Frobenius extension of a subalgebra B having depth 2, a surjective Frobenius homomorphism and one-dimensional centralizer R, then A is Hopf-Galois extension of B.\n\nThe proof of this theorem is a reconstruction theorem, requiring the construction of a Hopf algebra as a minimum, but in most papers done by construction of a nondegenerate pairing of two algebras in the iterated endomorphism algebra tower above B in A, and then a very delicate check that the resulting algebra-coalgebra structure is a Hopf algebra (see for example the  article from 2001 below); the method of proof is considerably simplified by the 2003 article cited below (albeit packaged into the definition of Hopf algebroid).  The Hopf algebroid structure on the endomorphism ring S of the B-bimodule A (discussed above) becomes a Hopf algebra in the presence of the hypothesis that the centralizer <math> R = \\{ r \\in A : \\forall b \\in B, br = rb \\} </math> is one-dimensional.  The action of an endomorphism on its space of definition is shown to be a Hopf-Galois action.  The dual Hopf algebra T introduced above as well in the Hopf algebroid context and the dual left action becomes a right coaction that makes A a T-Galois extension of B.  The condition that the Frobenius homomorphism map A onto all of B is used to show that B is precisely the invariant subalgebra of the Hopf-Galois action (and not just contained within).  The condition that A be a Frobenius extension over B is not as important to the proof as the depth two hypothesis and might be avoided by imposing a progenerator module condition on A as a natural B-module.\n\n== References ==\n\n* Tomasz Brzezinski; Robert Wisbauer, ''Corings and Comodules''.

She became the first ethnic Chinese and the first woman from [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] to be elevated to the [[Peer of the realm|peerage]] as a [[life peer]]ess with the title and style of Baroness in 1990.\n\nLaunching her career in British firms [[Swire Group]] and [[HSBC Group]], she was an Unofficial Member and then the [[Senior Unofficial Member|Senior Member]] of the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong|Executive Council]] and [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] of Hong Kong in the 1980s and 1990s, witnessing the major events of Hong Kong including the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] and the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. She is best known in Hong Kong for her part in (unsuccessfully) lobbying for the people of Hong Kong to have the right of abode in the United Kingdom after the [[Handover of Hong Kong]] on 1 July 1997, and she remained influential until her retirement from Hong Kong politics in 1995.\n\nFrom 1990 to 2010, she also served as a member of the [[House of Lords of the United Kingdom|House of Lords]], the first person of Chinese origin to assume such position. She resigned from the House of Lords in 2010 following the [[Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010]] which effectively disallows \"[[non-dom|Non-Dom]]s\" from sitting in either House of the British Parliament.\n\n==Early life, business and public career==\nDunn was born in Hong Kong to refugee parents from China. She was educated at the [[St. Paul's Convent School]] in Hong Kong, and at the [[College of the Holy Names]] and at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Upon her return to Hong Kong, she was hired by the [[Swire Group]] where she kept rising to the directorships of the John Swire and Sons (HK) Ltd., [[Swire Pacific Ltd.]], and [[Cathay Pacific Airways]]. In 1981, she became the first woman to sit on the director board of the [[Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank]].<ref name=\"hku\"/> From 1992 to 2008, she was the bank's deputy chairman.\n\nDunn also served on many public positions, including the chairmanship of the [[Trade Development Council]] from 1983 to 1991. In that capacity, she led missions abroad to promote Hong Kong textile and clothing products as well as stood firm against protectionism in her report for the Trade Policy Research Centre in 1983 on 'Protectionism and the Asian-Pacific Region'.<ref name=\"ubuckingham\"/> She was also the director of the [[Mass Transit Railway Corporation]] from 1979 to 1985 and served as the chairman of the [[Prince Philip Dental Hospital]] from 1981 to 1987, during the formative years of the [[University of Hong Kong]]\u2019s Faculty of Dentistry.<ref name=\"hku\"/>\n\n==Political career==\nDunn first entered Hong Kong politics when she was made an ''Unofficial Member'' of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] in 1976 by Governor [[Murray MacLehose]]. In 1982, she was made an Unofficial Member of the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong|Executive Council]] by Governor [[Edward Youde]].<ref name=\"hku\"/>\n\nDuring the Sino-British negotiations over the transfer of [[transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|Hong Kong sovereignty]] to China in the early 1980s, Dunn participated as a member of the delegations of Unofficial Members of the Executive and Legislative Councils, led by [[Senior Unofficial Member]] of the Executive Council Sir [[Sze-yuen Chung]], who travelled to London and Beijing to meet with [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]]. The aims of the members were to raise the concerns of the Hong Kong people and to negotiate for a better deal for Hong Kong. However, Beijing authorities rejected their suggestion that Hong Kong people had an independent role to play in the negotiations.<ref name=\"leave\"/> From 1985 to 1988, Dunn was the [[Senior Unofficial Member|Senior Member]] of the Legislative Council. In 1988, she succeeded Chung to become the [[Senior Unofficial Member|Senior Member]] of the Executive Council.\n\nAfter the signing of the 1984 [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], which ensured Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong after 1997, Dunn urged the British government to grant Hong Kong residents the [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|right of abode]] in Britain. She is best remembered in Hong Kong for breaking down in tears while giving testimony before a British parliamentary committee that was examining the Hong Kong question in May 1989 amidst the tumultuous [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] in China. Dunn said the British government would be \"morally indefensible\" for surrendering \"British citizens to a regime that did not hesitate to use its tanks and forces on its own people\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong Journal; A Plea to the Motherland: Listen to Your Heart|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/15/world/hong-kong-journal-a-plea-to-the-motherland-listen-to-your-heart.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=15 May 1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=A Concise History of Hong Kong|first=John M.|last=Carroll|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|year=2007}}</ref> Britain refused to change its restrictive nationality policy, but eventually allowed about 50,000 Hong Kong families to become British citizens through the [[British Nationality Selection Scheme]] in 1990 in the aftermath of the Tiananmen massacre. That year, Dunn was appointed to the [[House of Lords]] in 1989.\n\nIn May 1989, Dunn and several other Unofficial Members of the Executive and Legislative Councils presented the [[Basic Law Drafting Committee]] with a proposal for an \"OMELCO Consensus\" model for the post-1997 process of electing the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], providing a moderate alternative to those put forth by the [[pro-democracy camp]] and the conservative hardliners from the business and professional community. However, following Beijing's disapproval of the \"OMELCO Consensus\", Dunn softened her tone. In a [[House of Lords of the United Kingdom|House of Lords]] debate in 1992, Dunn described having more directly elected seats as \"unwise\" and talked of it as \"reviving uncertainty, tension and discord in our community.\" She also said that \"for the British Government to put a request to the Chinese Government, asking for democracy -- that, too, will be improper.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Hong Kong Hansard|url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr91-92/english/lc_sitg/hansard/h920624.pdf|work=Legislative Council of Hong Kong|date=24 June 1992}}</ref>\n\nFollowing [[Chris Patten]]'s arrival in Hong Kong as the colony's last governor in 1992, Dunn supported his proposal of separating the Executive Council from the Legislative Council so as to allow for more checks and balances. After a reshuffling of the Executive Council, Dunn became its sole remaining member. Subsequently, she became more outwardly discreet during the Patten governorship. It was widely speculated that she had lost her political influence due to her disagreement with the governor over his more confrontational approach in dealing with the Chinese as compared to her consensual approach. In 1995, Dunn announced that she was retiring from Hong Kong politics, fueling speculation in the media over whether she still believed in the territory's future after 1997.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dunn shock absorbed|date=16 June 1995|newspaper=South China Morning Post|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/121250/dunn-shock-absorbed}}</ref>\n\nWhile former British-appointed politicians found new favour with Beijing authorities in the run-up to 1997, Dunn bucked the trend by reinforcing her ties to Britain, retaining her seat in the House of Lords and maintaining high-profile positions in British companies, including [[HSBC Holdings]].<ref name=\"leave\">{{cite news|title=Baroness who kept Hong Kong spirits up admits she will leave|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/baroness-who-kept-hong-kong-spirits-up-admits-she-will-leave-1587035.html|date=17 June 1997|newspaper=Independent}}</ref> In 1996, she relocated to Britain with her British husband [[Michael David Thomas|Michael Thomas]], the former [[Attorney General of Hong Kong]].\n\nDunn rarely sat or spoke in the House of Lords during her years as a peer.

In 2010, Dunn auctioned 160 items from her private art collection at [[Christie's]], with lots reportedly valued at up to GBP30,000 (HK$354,000) each.<ref name=\"houselords\"/>\n\n==Honours==\nFor her services to Hong Kong, Dunn was made an OBE (Officer of the [[Most Excellent Order of the British Empire|Order of the British Empire]]) in 1978, and then a CBE (Commander) in 1983. In 1989, she was appointed DBE (Dame Commander), reportedly the first from Hong Kong to have such an honour. One year later, she became the first ethnic Chinese and the first woman from Hong Kong to be elevated to the British peerage in the [[Queen Elizabeth II]]\u2019s [[1990 Birthday Honours]]. She was introduced to the House of Lords as '''Baroness Dunn''', ''of [[Hong Kong Island]] in Hong Kong and of [[Knightsbridge]] in the [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]]''.

She became the first ethnic Chinese and the first woman from [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] to be elevated to the [[Peer of the realm|peerage]] as a [[life peer]]ess with the title and style of Baroness in 1990.\n\nLaunching her career in British firms [[Swire Group]] and [[HSBC Group]], she was an Unofficial Member and then the [[Senior Unofficial Member|Senior Member]] of the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong|Executive Council]] and [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] of Hong Kong in the 1980s and 1990s, witnessing the major events of Hong Kong including the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] and the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. She is best known in Hong Kong for her part in (unsuccessfully) lobbying for the people of Hong Kong to have the right of abode in the United Kingdom after the [[Handover of Hong Kong]] on 1 July 1997, and she remained influential until her retirement from Hong Kong politics in 1995.\n\nFrom 1990 to 2010, she also served as a member of the [[House of Lords of the United Kingdom|House of Lords]], the first person of Chinese origin to assume such position. She resigned from the House of Lords in 2010 following the [[Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010]] which effectively disallows \"[[non-dom|Non-Dom]]s\" from sitting in either House of the British Parliament.\n\n==Early life, business and public career==\nDunn was born in Hong Kong to refugee parents from China. She was educated at the [[St. Paul's Convent School]] in Hong Kong, and at the [[College of the Holy Names]] and at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Upon her return to Hong Kong, she was hired by the [[Swire Group]] where she kept rising to the directorships of the John Swire and Sons (HK) Ltd., [[Swire Pacific Ltd.]], and [[Cathay Pacific Airways]]. In 1981, she became the first woman to sit on the director board of the [[Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank]].<ref name=\"hku\"/> From 1992 to 2008, she was the bank's deputy chairman.\n\nDunn also served on many public positions, including the chairmanship of the [[Trade Development Council]] from 1983 to 1991. In that capacity, she led missions abroad to promote Hong Kong textile and clothing products as well as stood firm against protectionism in her report for the Trade Policy Research Centre in 1983 on 'Protectionism and the Asian-Pacific Region'.<ref name=\"ubuckingham\"/> She was also the director of the [[Mass Transit Railway Corporation]] from 1979 to 1985 and served as the chairman of the [[Prince Philip Dental Hospital]] from 1981 to 1987, during the formative years of the [[University of Hong Kong]]\u2019s Faculty of Dentistry.<ref name=\"hku\"/>\n\n==Political career==\nDunn first entered Hong Kong politics when she was made an ''Unofficial Member'' of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] in 1976 by Governor [[Murray MacLehose]]. In 1982, she was made an Unofficial Member of the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong|Executive Council]] by Governor [[Edward Youde]].<ref name=\"hku\"/>\n\nDuring the Sino-British negotiations over the transfer of [[transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|Hong Kong sovereignty]] to China in the early 1980s, Dunn participated as a member of the delegations of Unofficial Members of the Executive and Legislative Councils, led by [[Senior Unofficial Member]] of the Executive Council Sir [[Sze-yuen Chung]], who travelled to London and Beijing to meet with [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]]. The aims of the members were to raise the concerns of the Hong Kong people and to negotiate for a better deal for Hong Kong. However, Beijing authorities rejected their suggestion that Hong Kong people had an independent role to play in the negotiations.<ref name=\"leave\"/> From 1985 to 1988, Dunn was the [[Senior Unofficial Member|Senior Member]] of the Legislative Council. In 1988, she succeeded Chung to become the [[Senior Unofficial Member|Senior Member]] of the Executive Council.\n\nAfter the signing of the 1984 [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], which ensured Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong after 1997, Dunn urged the British government to grant Hong Kong residents the [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|right of abode]] in Britain. She is best remembered in Hong Kong for breaking down in tears while giving testimony before a British parliamentary committee that was examining the Hong Kong question in May 1989 amidst the tumultuous [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] in China. Dunn said the British government would be \"morally indefensible\" for surrendering \"British citizens to a regime that did not hesitate to use its tanks and forces on its own people\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong Journal; A Plea to the Motherland: Listen to Your Heart|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/15/world/hong-kong-journal-a-plea-to-the-motherland-listen-to-your-heart.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=15 May 1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=A Concise History of Hong Kong|first=John M.|last=Carroll|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|year=2007}}</ref> Britain refused to change its restrictive nationality policy, but eventually allowed about 50,000 Hong Kong families to become British citizens through the [[British Nationality Selection Scheme]] in 1990 in the aftermath of the Tiananmen massacre. That year, Dunn was appointed to the [[House of Lords]] in 1989.\n\nIn May 1989, Dunn and several other Unofficial Members of the Executive and Legislative Councils presented the [[Basic Law Drafting Committee]] with a proposal for an \"OMELCO Consensus\" model for the post-1997 process of electing the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], providing a moderate alternative to those put forth by the [[pro-democracy camp]] and the conservative hardliners from the business and professional community. However, following Beijing's disapproval of the \"OMELCO Consensus\", Dunn softened her tone. In a [[House of Lords of the United Kingdom|House of Lords]] debate in 1992, Dunn described having more directly elected seats as \"unwise\" and talked of it as \"reviving uncertainty, tension and discord in our community.\" She also said that \"for the British Government to put a request to the Chinese Government, asking for democracy -- that, too, will be improper.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Hong Kong Hansard|url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr91-92/english/lc_sitg/hansard/h920624.pdf|work=Legislative Council of Hong Kong|date=24 June 1992}}</ref>\n\nFollowing [[Chris Patten]]'s arrival in Hong Kong as the colony's last governor in 1992, Dunn supported his proposal of separating the Executive Council from the Legislative Council so as to allow for more checks and balances. After a reshuffling of the Executive Council, Dunn became its sole remaining member. Subsequently, she became more outwardly discreet during the Patten governorship. It was widely speculated that she had lost her political influence due to her disagreement with the governor over his more confrontational approach in dealing with the Chinese as compared to her consensual approach. In 1995, Dunn announced that she was retiring from Hong Kong politics, fueling speculation in the media over whether she still believed in the territory's future after 1997.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dunn shock absorbed|date=16 June 1995|newspaper=South China Morning Post|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/121250/dunn-shock-absorbed}}</ref>\n\nWhile former British-appointed politicians found new favour with Beijing authorities in the run-up to 1997, Dunn bucked the trend by reinforcing her ties to Britain, retaining her seat in the House of Lords and maintaining high-profile positions in British companies, including [[HSBC Holdings]].<ref name=\"leave\">{{cite news|title=Baroness who kept Hong Kong spirits up admits she will leave|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/baroness-who-kept-hong-kong-spirits-up-admits-she-will-leave-1587035.html|date=17 June 1997|newspaper=Independent}}</ref> In 1996, she relocated to Britain with her British husband [[Michael David Thomas|Michael Thomas]], the former [[Attorney General of Hong Kong]].\n\nDunn rarely sat or spoke in the House of Lords during her years as a peer.

She as four stepchildren from Thomas's previous marriage. She has reportedly been living in London since 1996. In 2010, Dunn auctioned 160 items from her private art collection at [[Christie's]], with lots reportedly valued at up to GBP30,000 (HK$354,000) each.<ref name=\"houselords\"/>\n\n==Honours==\nFor her services to Hong Kong, Dunn was made an OBE (Officer of the [[Most Excellent Order of the British Empire|Order of the British Empire]]) in 1978, and then a CBE (Commander) in 1983. In 1989, she was appointed DBE (Dame Commander), reportedly the first from Hong Kong to have such an honour. One year later, she became the first ethnic Chinese and the first woman from Hong Kong to be elevated to the British peerage in the [[Queen Elizabeth II]]\u2019s [[1990 Birthday Honours]]. She was introduced to the House of Lords as '''Baroness Dunn''', ''of [[Hong Kong Island]] in Hong Kong and of [[Knightsbridge]] in the [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]]''.
