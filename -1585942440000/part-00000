Because it infects red blood cells as a result of the affinity for the P antigen, parvovirus causes complete cessation of red blood cell production. In most cases, this goes unnoticed, as red blood cells live on average 120 days, and the drop in production does not significantly affect the total number of circulating red blood cells. In people with conditions where the cells die early (such as [[sickle cell disease]]), however, parvovirus infection can lead to severe anemia.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nMore frequently parvovirus B19 is associated with aplastic crisis which involves only the red blood cells (despite the name). Aplastic anemia involves all different cell lines.\n\nViruses that have been linked to the development of aplastic anemia include hepatitis, Epstein-Barr, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19 and HIV.\n\nIn some [[animals]], aplastic anemia may have other causes. For example, in the [[ferret]] (''Mustela putorius furo''), it is caused by [[estrogen]] toxicity, because female ferrets are [[Estrous cycle|induced ovulators]], so mating is required to bring the female out of heat. Intact females, if not mated, will remain in heat, and after some time the high levels of estrogen will cause the bone marrow to stop producing red blood cells.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThe condition needs to be differentiated from pure red cell aplasia. In aplastic anemia, the patient has pancytopenia (i.e., leukopenia and thrombocytopenia) resulting in decrease of all formed elements. In contrast, pure red cell aplasia is characterized by reduction in red cells only. The diagnosis can only be confirmed on [[bone marrow examination]]. Before this procedure is undertaken, a patient will generally have had other [[blood test]]s to find diagnostic clues, including a [[complete blood count]], [[renal function]] and [[electrolyte]]s, [[liver enzyme]]s, [[thyroid]] function tests, [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] and [[folic acid]] levels.\n\nThe following tests aid in determining differential diagnosis for aplastic anemia:\n#  Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy: to rule out other causes of pancytopenia (i.e. neoplastic infiltration or significant myelofibrosis).\n#  History of iatrogenic exposure to [[Cytotoxicity|cytotoxic]] chemotherapy: can cause transient bone marrow suppression\n#  X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, or ultrasound imaging tests: enlarged lymph nodes (sign of lymphoma), kidneys and bones in arms and hands (abnormal in Fanconi anemia)\n#  Chest X-ray: infections\n#  Liver tests: liver diseases\n#  Viral studies: viral infections\n#  Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and folate levels: vitamin deficiency\n#  Blood tests for [[paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria]]\n#  Test for antibodies: immune competency\n\n==Treatment==\nTreating immune-mediated aplastic anemia involves suppression of the [[immune system]], an effect achieved by daily [[medicine]] intake, or, in more severe cases, a [[bone marrow transplant]], a potential cure.<ref name=\"pmid17229630\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Locasciulli A, Oneto R, Bacigalupo A |title=Outcome of patients with acquired aplastic anemia given first line bone marrow transplantation or immunosuppressive treatment in the last decade: a report from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) |journal=Haematologica |volume=92 |issue=1 |pages=11\u20138 |year=2007 |pmid=17229630|doi=10.3324/haematol.10075|display-authors=etal}}</ref> The transplanted bone marrow replaces the failing bone marrow cells with new ones from a matching donor.

In people with conditions where the cells die early (such as [[sickle cell disease]]), however, parvovirus infection can lead to severe anemia.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nMore frequently parvovirus B19 is associated with aplastic crisis which involves only the red blood cells (despite the name). Aplastic anemia involves all different cell lines.\n\nViruses that have been linked to the development of aplastic anemia include hepatitis, Epstein-Barr, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19 and HIV.\n\nIn some [[animals]], aplastic anemia may have other causes. For example, in the [[ferret]] (''Mustela putorius furo''), it is caused by [[estrogen]] toxicity, because female ferrets are [[Estrous cycle|induced ovulators]], so mating is required to bring the female out of heat. Intact females, if not mated, will remain in heat, and after some time the high levels of estrogen will cause the bone marrow to stop producing red blood cells.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThe condition needs to be differentiated from pure red cell aplasia. In aplastic anemia, the patient has pancytopenia (i.e., leukopenia and thrombocytopenia) resulting in decrease of all formed elements. In contrast, pure red cell aplasia is characterized by reduction in red cells only. The diagnosis can only be confirmed on [[bone marrow examination]]. Before this procedure is undertaken, a patient will generally have had other [[blood test]]s to find diagnostic clues, including a [[complete blood count]], [[renal function]] and [[electrolyte]]s, [[liver enzyme]]s, [[thyroid]] function tests, [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] and [[folic acid]] levels.\n\nThe following tests aid in determining differential diagnosis for aplastic anemia:\n#  Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy: to rule out other causes of pancytopenia (i.e. neoplastic infiltration or significant myelofibrosis).\n#  History of iatrogenic exposure to [[Cytotoxicity|cytotoxic]] chemotherapy: can cause transient bone marrow suppression\n#  X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, or ultrasound imaging tests: enlarged lymph nodes (sign of lymphoma), kidneys and bones in arms and hands (abnormal in Fanconi anemia)\n#  Chest X-ray: infections\n#  Liver tests: liver diseases\n#  Viral studies: viral infections\n#  Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and folate levels: vitamin deficiency\n#  Blood tests for [[paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria]]\n#  Test for antibodies: immune competency\n\n==Treatment==\nTreating immune-mediated aplastic anemia involves suppression of the [[immune system]], an effect achieved by daily [[medicine]] intake, or, in more severe cases, a [[bone marrow transplant]], a potential cure.<ref name=\"pmid17229630\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Locasciulli A, Oneto R, Bacigalupo A |title=Outcome of patients with acquired aplastic anemia given first line bone marrow transplantation or immunosuppressive treatment in the last decade: a report from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) |journal=Haematologica |volume=92 |issue=1 |pages=11\u20138 |year=2007 |pmid=17229630|doi=10.3324/haematol.10075|display-authors=etal}}</ref> The transplanted bone marrow replaces the failing bone marrow cells with new ones from a matching donor. The [[multipotency|multipotent]] stem cells in the bone marrow reconstitute all three blood cell lines, giving the patient a new immune system, red blood cells, and platelets. However, besides the risk of graft failure, there is also a risk that the newly created white blood cells may attack the rest of the body (\"[[graft-versus-host disease]]\"). In young patients with an [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] matched sibling donor, bone marrow transplant can be considered as first-line treatment, patients lacking a matched sibling donor typically pursue immunosuppression as a first-line treatment, and matched unrelated donor transplants are considered a second-line therapy.\n\nMedical therapy of aplastic anemia often includes a course of [[antithymocyte globulin]] (ATG) and several months of treatment with cyclosporine to modulate the [[immune system]].  [[Chemotherapy]] with agents such as [[cyclophosphamide]]  may also be effective but has more toxicity than ATG. [[Antibody]] therapy, such as ATG, targets T-cells, which are believed to attack the bone marrow. [[Corticosteroids]] are generally ineffective,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} though they are used to ameliorate [[serum sickness]] caused by ATG.

Occasionally PNH dominates over time, with the major manifestation intravascular hemolysis. The overlap of AA and PNH has been speculated to be an escape mechanism by the bone marrow against destruction by the immune system. [[Flow cytometry]] testing is performed regularly in people with previous aplastic anemia to monitor for the development of PNH.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n==Prognosis==\nUntreated, severe aplastic anemia has a high risk of death.

Growth was driven mainly by the recovering oil and gas sector and further economic expansion of 3.9% is forecast in 2015 and 4.0% in 2016.<ref>http://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org/en/country-notes/north-africa/algeria/ Algeria: African Economic Outlook, May 2015</ref>\n\nIn 2012, [[Algeria]]'s economy grew by 2.5%, up slightly from 2.4% in 2011. Excluding hydrocarbons, growth has been estimated at 5.8% (up from 5.7% in 2011). Inflation is increasing and is estimated at 8.9% (up from 4.49% in 2011). Despite the financial authorities\u2019 good performance, thanks to modernisation reforms, the budget deficit widened to 3.3% of GDP in 2012 (as against 1.3% in 2011) due to the continuation of the expansionary fiscal policy initiated in 2011 to meet strong social demands in terms of purchasing power, jobs and housing. The oil and gas sector is the country's main source of revenues, generated about 70% of total budget receipts. The economy is projected to grow by 3.2% in 2013 and by 4.0% in 2014.\nThe country's external position remained comfortable in 2012, with a trade surplus of about US$27.18 billion. The current-account surplus is estimated at 8.2% of GDP and official foreign-exchange reserves have been estimated at US$190.7 billion at end-December 2012, or the equivalent of more than three years of imports of non-factor goods and services. Oil and gas export earnings made up more than 97% of total exports.\n\nAlgeria has enormous possibilities to boost its economic growth, including huge foreign-exchange reserves derived from oil and gas. A development strategy targeting stronger, sustained growth would create more jobs, especially for young people, and alleviate the housing shortage the country is facing. The national strategic option is therefore to revitalise the process intended to diversify the economy starting with the non-oil sector while deepening the reforms needed for the structural transformation of the economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afdb.org/en/countries/north-africa/algeria/algeria-economic-outlook/|title=Algeria Economic Outlook|website=African Development Bank|accessdate=30 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Historical trend==\nThe total imports and exports on the eve of the French invasion (in 1830) did not exceed \u00a3175,000. By 1850, the figures had reached \u00a35,000,000; in 1868, \u00a312,000,000; in 1880, \u00a317,000,000; and in 1890, \u00a320,000,000. From this point progress was slower and the figures varied considerably year by year. In 1905 the total value of the foreign trade was \u00a324,500,000. About five-sixths of the trade is with or via France, into which country several Algerian goods have been admitted duty-free since 1851, and all since 1867. French goods, except [[sugar]], have been admitted into Algeria without payment of duty since 1835. After the 1892 increase of the French minimum tariff which applied to Algeria for the first time, foreign trade greatly diminished.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nGDP per capita grew 40% in the 1960s, reaching a peak growth of 538% in the 1970s.<ref>[http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/economics-business/variable-638.html GDP: GDP per capita, current US dollars<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220000000/http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/economics-business/variable-638.html |date=February 20, 2009 }}</ref> Growth collapsed to 9.7% in the turbulent 1980s.

Algeria's economy has grown at about 4% annually since 1999. The country's foreign debt has fallen from a high of $28 billion in 1999 to its current level of $5 billion. The spike in oil prices in 1999\u20132000 and the government's tight fiscal policy, as well as a large increase in the trade surplus and the near tripling of foreign exchange reserves has helped the country's finances. However, an ongoing drought, the after effects of the floods of 10 November 2001 and an uncertain oil market made prospects for 2002-03 more problematic. The government has pledged to continue its efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector.\n\n[[Image:Tlemcen Hotel Zianides.jpg|thumb|200px|Hotel Zianides in [[Tlemcen]].]] \n[[Abdelaziz Bouteflika|President Bouteflika]] has announced sweeping economic reforms, which, if implemented, will significantly restructure the economy. Still, the economy remains heavily dependent on volatile oil and gas revenues. The government has continued efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector, but has had little success in reducing high unemployment and improving living standards. Other priority areas include banking reform, improving the investment environment, and reducing government bureaucracy.\n\nThe government has announced plans to sell off state enterprises: sales of a national cement factory and steel plant have been completed and other industries are up for offer. In 2001, Algeria signed an Association Agreement with the [[European Union]]. In June 1987, Algeria started accession negotiations for entry into the [[World Trade Organization]], but negotiations ceased in \t 2014.\n\n== Data ==\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132017.

Although economic liberalisation has advocates in Algeria, in 2018 froze all plans to pursue privatisation.<ref name=jacobin>{{cite web |url=https://jacobinmag.com/2019/04/algeria-protests-abdelaziz-bouteflika-corruption-economy |title=The End of Absurdity in Algeria |last=Al-Sholi |first=Ahmad |date=21 April 2019 |website=[[Jacobin (magazine)]] |access-date=19 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, the social safety net in Algeria is stronger than in other countries in the region: it saw periods of expansion in the 1970s, and in the 2000s, helping to build stability after the [[Algerian Civil War|Civil War]]. It is supplemented by consumer [[subsidy|subsidies]]. These measures allow for wages to be kept low.<ref name=jacobin />\n\nThe restrictive [[political economy]] in Algeria and continued adherence to the ISI model has limited [[foreign direct investment]] in the country: Algeria has one of the lowest levels of FDI in Africa. However, local businesses have benefited from the state undertaking [[public works]] projects in the construction of roads, ports, dams and housing. Both [[fixed capital]] formation and credit extended to the private sector increased during the 2010s.<ref name=jacobin />\n\n==Industries==\n\n===Agriculture, forestry, and fishing===\n{{See also|Agriculture in Algeria}}\nAlgeria's agricultural sector, which contributes about 8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) but employs 14 percent of the workforce, is unable to meet the food needs of the country's population. As a result, some 45 percent of food is imported. The primary crops are wheat, barley, and potatoes. Farmers also have had success growing dates for export. Cultivation is concentrated in the fertile coastal plain of the Tell region, which represents just a slice of Algeria's total territory. Altogether, only about 3 percent of Algerian territory is arable. Even in the Tell, rainfall variability has a significant impact on production. Government efforts to stimulate farming in the less arable steppe and desert regions have met with limited success. However, herdsmen maintain livestock, specifically  cow and sheep in the High Plateaus region.<ref>Algeria country profile, pp. 11\u201312.</ref>\n \nAlgeria's climate and periodic fires are not conducive to a thriving forestry industry. However, Algeria is a producer of cork and Aleppo pine. In 2005 roundwood removals totaled 7.8 million cubic meters, while sawnwood production amounted to only 13 million cubic meters per year.<ref name= cpd >Algeria country profile, p. 12.</ref>\n \nAlgeria's [[fishing industry]] does not take full advantage of the Mediterranean coast, in part because fishing is generally done from small family-owned boats instead of large commercial fishing trawlers. However, the government is attempting to boost the relatively small catch\u2014slightly more than 125,000 metric tons in 2005\u2014by modernizing fishing ports, permitting foreigners to fish in Algerian waters, and subsidizing fishing-related projects.<ref name= cpd/>\n\n===Fishing===\nFishing is a flourishing but minor industry. Fish caught are principally [[sardine]]s, [[bonito]], [[mackerel]] [[smelt (fish)|smelt]] and [[sprat]]s. Fresh fish are exported to [[France]], dried and preserved fish to [[Spain]] and [[Italy]]. Coral [[fishery|fisheries]] are found along the coast from [[Annaba|Bona]] to [[Tunis]].  The annual catch averages around 142,000 tons, 54% sardines.\n\n===Minerals===\n{{Main|Mining in Algeria}}\nAlgeria is rich in minerals; the country has many iron, [[lead]], zinc, [[copper]], [[Calamine (mineral)|calamine]], [[antimony]] and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] mines. The most productive are those of iron and zinc. Lignite is found in Algiers; immense phosphate beds were discovered near [[T\u00e9bessa]] in 1891, yielding 313,500 tons in 1905. Phosphate beds are also worked near [[S\u00e9tif]], [[Guelma]] and [[A\u00efn Be\u00efda, Oum El Bouaghi|A\u00efn Be\u00efda]]. There are more than 300 quarries which produce, amongst other stones, [[onyx]] and white and red [[marble]]s. Algerian onyx from Ain Tekbalet was used by the Romans, and many ancient quarries have been found near [[Sidi Ben Yebka]], some being certainly those from which the long-lost Numidian marbles were taken. [[Salt]] is collected on the margins of the chotts.\n\n===Banking and finance===\n{{See also|Bank of Algeria}}\nAlgeria's banking sector is dominated by public banks, which suffer from high levels of non-performing loans to state-owned enterprises (SOEs). As of 2007, public banks controlled 95 percent of total bank assets. In 2007 nonperforming loans represented a towering 38 percent of total loans at public banks, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates. Modest progress has been made in implementing several reforms proposed by the IMF, including replacing bank credits to SOEs with government subsidies; boosting bank supervision, accountability, and transparency; and modernizing the payments system. One specific reform that has been achieved is the establishment in 2006 of the Algerian Real Time Settlements system, which facilitates the prompt and reliable electronic transfer of payments. In November 2007, the proposed sale and privatization of Cr\u00e9dit Populaire d\u2019Alg\u00e9rie was postponed because of turbulent market conditions. Recently, HSBC and Deutsche Bank announced that they would commence commercial banking (in the case of HSBC) and investment banking (in the case of Deutsche Bank) in Algeria. Only a few companies are listed on the underdeveloped and relatively opaque Algiers stock exchange.<ref name= cpd/>\nThe non-bank sector remains less developed, although recent reforms in the field of regulation and supervision have laid the foundations for leasing, factoring, and venture capital.\n\nThe Algerian equity market remains relatively shallow, with only two companies being listed in the Bourse d\u2019Algerie. Conversely, the bond market has expanded in recent years: the government has issued debt instruments with varying maturities of up to fifteen years, and five private companies have issued corporate bonds.\n\nThe insurance sector was liberalized in 1995, but is still dominated by government-owned institutions and so far accounts only for a very small part of the economy: total premium volume amounted to approximately 1 percent of GDP. The pension sector encompasses three pension funds, which attained coverage of approximately 40 percent of the working population in 2005.\n\nBased on 2006 and 2007 estimates, 31 percent of the total population has access to financial services, with one bank branch or post office every 7,250 inhabitants. The microfinance sector still has great potential for further development. A 2006 study could not find major regulatory impediments to microfinance and suggested that the geographical net of postal offices \u2013 offering an increasing number of financial services to customers \u2013 holds a high potential of increasing access to finance for the Algerian population.\n\t \nOfficial remittance inflows increased steadily from US$1.9 to 2.9 billion between 2005 and 2007.<ref name=\"MFW4A Algeria Country Profile\"/>\n\n===Tourism===\n{{Main|Tourism in Algeria}}\nAlgeria's tourism industry, which contributes only about 1 percent of GDP, lags behind that of its neighbors Morocco and Tunisia. Algeria receives only about 200,000 tourists and visitors annually. Ethnic Algerian French citizens represent the largest group of tourists, followed by Tunisians. The modest level of tourism is attributable to a combination of poor hotel accommodations and the threat of terrorism. However, the government has adopted a plan known as \u201cHorizon 2025,\u201d which is designed to address the lack of infrastructure. Various hotel operators are planning to build hotels, particularly along the Mediterranean coast. Another potential opportunity involves adventure holidays in the south. The Algerian government has set the goal of boosting the number of foreign visitors, including tourists, to 1.2 million by 2010.<ref name= cpd/>\n\n===Other industries===\nAlgeria has many diversified industries that contribute to meet local demands and some times to exportation. The food industry is one of the largest industrial sector in Algeria. Private companies generally dominate the food sector in Algeria with large companies such as Cevital, La Belle, Groupe Bimo, Hamoud Boualam, Ifri, G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Emballage.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry is also present in Algeria, with the domination of state-owned company Saidal, as well as other small private companies. The local pharmaceutical industry covers 38% of local needs.\n\nThe mechanical industry has existed in Algeria for a long time, with the state-owned company SNVI (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des V\u00e9hicules Industriels) being the largest producer of buses and industrial vehicles in the region. These vehicles are exported to the Maghreb, Africa, and the Middle East. Mercedes-Benz has also invested in Algeria in cooperation with a state-owned company to produce industrial and military vehicles. Deutz AG also invested to produce agricultural utilities.\n\nIn the electric and electronic industry, Algeria has made a great leap in the field compared to its neighbours. The Algerian region Bordj-Bou-Arreridj is the biggest electronic pole in Africa, local companies cover 83% of it needs and export other products, Algeria started producing some 100% home made electronic product including smartphones, tablets, TV, TV decoders, air conditioning products ..., at least 16 big companies are active in the field, some of the companies are : Bya Electronic, HB Technologies, ZALA Computer, Cristor, Condor, Cobra, Continental \u00e9lectronique, Essalem Electronics, Samha, FRIGOR, BMS Electric, Bomare Company, etc.\n\n==Currency, exchange rate, and inflation==\nAlgeria's currency is the [[Algerian dinar|dinar]] (DZD). The dinar is loosely linked to the U.S. dollar in a managed float. Algeria's main export, crude oil, is priced in dollars, while most of Algeria's imports are priced in euros. Therefore, the government endeavors to manage fluctuations in the value of the dinar. As of April 2008, US$1 was equivalent to about DZD 64.6.<ref name=cp15/>\n \nAlgeria's foreign currency reserves have grown rapidly since 2000, reflecting rising prices for exported oil. At the end of 2007, foreign reserves totaled US$99.3 billion, up from US$12 billion in 2000 and the equivalent of almost four years of imports.<ref name=cp15/> In 2007 the estimated inflation rate was 4.6 percent.<ref name=cp11/>\n\nIn 2010, the IMF voiced concerns about poor management of Algeria's monetary system and inflation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.echoroukonline.com/eng/business/10996-imf-report-algerian-monetary-system-going-from-bad-to-worse.html|accessdate=2010-10-31|title=Echorouk Online - IMF report: Algerian monetary system going from bad to worse|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724173616/http://www.echoroukonline.com/eng/business/10996-imf-report-algerian-monetary-system-going-from-bad-to-worse.html|archive-date=2011-07-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2014, a report focusing on world economic projections was published by the IMF, according to which it was predicted that, in 2015, Algeria's economic growth would fall by 1.5%, while unemployment would rise by 1.2%.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fanack|title=Algeria\u2019s Struggling Economy in Perspective|url=https://chronicle.fanack.com/algeria/economy/algerias-struggling-economy-in-perspective/|website=Fanack.com|accessdate=27 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Labor==\n{{See also|Trade unions in Algeria}}\nThe largest employer is government, which claims 32 percent of the workforce. Even though industry is a much larger part of the economy than agriculture, agriculture employs slightly more people (14 percent of the workforce) than industry (13.4 percent of the workforce). One of the reasons for this disparity is that the energy sector is very capital-intensive. Trade accounts for 14.6 percent of the workforce, while the construction and public works sector employs 10 percent, reflecting the government's efforts to upgrade the country's infrastructure and stock of affordable housing.<ref name=cp13>Algeria country profile, p. 13.</ref>\n\nUnemployment has remained at levels around 10% since 2010 but is significantly higher for youth (24.8%) and women (16.3%)<ref>Algeria Overview, World Bank (31 March 2015) http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/algeria/overview</ref>\n \nAt the end of 2006, the unemployment rate was about 15.7 percent, but the rate among those under the age of 25 was 70 percent. In 2005 the labor participation rate was only 52 percent, versus an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average of 70 percent. New entrants to the workforce and the lack of emigration options make unemployment a chronic problem and an important challenge to the government. Given its highly capital-intensive nature, the hydrocarbons industry is not in a position to employ many job seekers.<ref name=cp13/>\n\n==Foreign economic relations==\nAlgeria is seeking more trade and foreign investment. For example, the hydrocarbons law passed in April 2005 is designed to encourage foreign investment in energy exploration. Increased production could raise Algeria's profile as a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. In keeping with its pro-trade agenda, Algeria achieved association status with the European Union (EU) in September 2005. Over a 12-year period, the association agreement is expected to enable Algeria to export goods to the EU tariff-free, while it gradually lifts tariffs on imports from the EU. Algeria has signed bilateral investment agreements with 20 different nations, including many European countries, China, Egypt, Malaysia, and Yemen. In July 2001, the United States and Algeria agreed on a framework for discussions leading to such an agreement, but a final treaty has not yet been negotiated. Ultimately, trade liberalization, customs modernization, deregulation, and banking reform are designed to improve the country's negotiating position as it seeks accession to the World Trade Organization.<ref name=cp14>Algeria country profile, p. 14</ref>\n\nIn 2007 Algerian imports totaled US$26.08 billion. The principal imports were capital goods, foodstuffs, and consumer goods. The top import partners were France (22 percent), Italy (8.6 percent), China (8.5 percent), Germany (5.9 percent), Spain (5.9 percent), the United States (4.8 percent), and Turkey (4.5 percent). In 2007 Algeria exported US$63.3 billion, more than twice as much as it imported. Exports accounted for 30 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Hydrocarbon products constituted at least 95 percent of export earnings. The principal exports were petroleum, natural gas, and petroleum products. The top export partners were the United States (27.2 percent), Italy (17 percent), Spain (9.7 percent), France (8.8 percent), Canada (8.1 percent), and Belgium (4.3 percent). Algeria supplies 25 percent of the European Union's natural gas imports. In 2007 Algeria posted a positive merchandise trade balance of US$37.2 billion. In 2007 Algeria achieved a positive current account balance of US$31.5 billion. High prices for Algeria's energy exports are the main driver for the improvement in the \ncurrent account balance.<ref name=cp14/>\n\nAlgeria's trade surplus for 2010 rose to over $83.14 billion. The Algerian Centre for Information and Statistics Directorate of the Algerian Customs attribute this increase from the previous year to higher fuel revenue due to higher prices for a barrel of oil, and a slight decrease in imports of consumer non-food materials.  The center said that Algerian exports rose by 78.26% during the period from January to November 2010 from $27.51 billion to $44.4 billion during the same period in 2009. Imports grew by 89.1% from $43.36 billion to $76.35 billion between 2009 and 2010.<ref name=\"nuqudy.com\">{{cite web |url=http://nuqudy.com/201012272084/arab-markets/algeria-trade-surplus-oil-prices-consumer-products |title=Algeria's trade surplus |publisher=Nuqudy |accessdate=2010-12-29 |date=2010-12-27}}</ref>\n\nReflecting strong oil export revenues, external debt is on a downward trajectory. For example, these revenues facilitated early repayments of US$900 million in loans from the African Development Bank and Saudi Arabia. In March 2006, Algeria's purchase of 78 aircraft from Russia led to the cancellation of Algeria's entire debt to Russia. In 2006 external debt was estimated at US$4.4 billion, down from US$23.5 billion in 2003.<ref name=cp14/>\n \nIn 2006 foreign direct investment (FDI) in Algeria totaled US$1.8 billion. The petrochemical, transport, and utilities sectors have been recent beneficiaries of FDI. FDI into the oil sector was expected to rise as a result of a hydrocarbons law, approved in April 2005, that created a more even playing field for foreign oil companies to compete with Algeria's state-owned oil company, Sonatrach, for exploration and production contracts. Algeria also is seeking foreign investment in power and water systems.<ref name=cp14/>\n\nAs of August 2006, cumulative World Bank assistance to Algeria totaled US$5.9 billion, encompassing 72 projects. Currently, the World Bank is pursuing seven projects, specifically budget modernization, mortgage finance, natural disaster recovery, energy and mining, rural employment, telecommunications, and transportation. In 2005 economic assistance to Algeria from the United States amounted to US$4.4 million, most of which was attributable to the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and the remainder to International Military Education and Training (IMET). MEPI encourages economic, political, and educational reform in the Middle East. In 2006 IMET, which provides U.S. military training to foreign troops, had a budget of US$823 million. In 2005 the European Union contributed US$58 million to Algeria's economic development under the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.<ref name=cp15>Algeria country profile, p. 15.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Energy in Algeria]]\n*[[List of companies of Algeria]]\n* {{req|Poverty in Algeria}}<!--see [[:Category:Poverty by country]]-->\n* [[Taxation in Algeria]]\n* [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n===Works cited===\n*[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Algeria.pdf Algeria country profile].

Growth was driven mainly by the recovering oil and gas sector and further economic expansion of 3.9% is forecast in 2015 and 4.0% in 2016.<ref>http://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org/en/country-notes/north-africa/algeria/ Algeria: African Economic Outlook, May 2015</ref>\n\nIn 2012, [[Algeria]]'s economy grew by 2.5%, up slightly from 2.4% in 2011. Excluding hydrocarbons, growth has been estimated at 5.8% (up from 5.7% in 2011). Inflation is increasing and is estimated at 8.9% (up from 4.49% in 2011). Despite the financial authorities\u2019 good performance, thanks to modernisation reforms, the budget deficit widened to 3.3% of GDP in 2012 (as against 1.3% in 2011) due to the continuation of the expansionary fiscal policy initiated in 2011 to meet strong social demands in terms of purchasing power, jobs and housing. The oil and gas sector is the country's main source of revenues, generated about 70% of total budget receipts. The economy is projected to grow by 3.2% in 2013 and by 4.0% in 2014.\nThe country's external position remained comfortable in 2012, with a trade surplus of about US$27.18 billion. The current-account surplus is estimated at 8.2% of GDP and official foreign-exchange reserves have been estimated at US$190.7 billion at end-December 2012, or the equivalent of more than three years of imports of non-factor goods and services. Oil and gas export earnings made up more than 97% of total exports.\n\nAlgeria has enormous possibilities to boost its economic growth, including huge foreign-exchange reserves derived from oil and gas. A development strategy targeting stronger, sustained growth would create more jobs, especially for young people, and alleviate the housing shortage the country is facing. The national strategic option is therefore to revitalise the process intended to diversify the economy starting with the non-oil sector while deepening the reforms needed for the structural transformation of the economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afdb.org/en/countries/north-africa/algeria/algeria-economic-outlook/|title=Algeria Economic Outlook|website=African Development Bank|accessdate=30 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Historical trend==\nThe total imports and exports on the eve of the French invasion (in 1830) did not exceed \u00a3175,000. By 1850, the figures had reached \u00a35,000,000; in 1868, \u00a312,000,000; in 1880, \u00a317,000,000; and in 1890, \u00a320,000,000. From this point progress was slower and the figures varied considerably year by year. In 1905 the total value of the foreign trade was \u00a324,500,000. About five-sixths of the trade is with or via France, into which country several Algerian goods have been admitted duty-free since 1851, and all since 1867. French goods, except [[sugar]], have been admitted into Algeria without payment of duty since 1835. After the 1892 increase of the French minimum tariff which applied to Algeria for the first time, foreign trade greatly diminished.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nGDP per capita grew 40% in the 1960s, reaching a peak growth of 538% in the 1970s.<ref>[http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/economics-business/variable-638.html GDP: GDP per capita, current US dollars<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220000000/http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/economics-business/variable-638.html |date=February 20, 2009 }}</ref> Growth collapsed to 9.7% in the turbulent 1980s.

In March 2006, [[Russia]] agreed to erase $4.74 billion of Algeria's Soviet-era debt during a visit by President [[Vladimir Putin]] to the country, the first by a Russian leader in half a century.

Algeria's economy has grown at about 4% annually since 1999. The country's foreign debt has fallen from a high of $28 billion in 1999 to its current level of $5 billion. The spike in oil prices in 1999\u20132000 and the government's tight fiscal policy, as well as a large increase in the trade surplus and the near tripling of foreign exchange reserves has helped the country's finances. However, an ongoing drought, the after effects of the floods of 10 November 2001 and an uncertain oil market made prospects for 2002-03 more problematic. The government has pledged to continue its efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector.\n\n[[Image:Tlemcen Hotel Zianides.jpg|thumb|200px|Hotel Zianides in [[Tlemcen]].]] \n[[Abdelaziz Bouteflika|President Bouteflika]] has announced sweeping economic reforms, which, if implemented, will significantly restructure the economy. Still, the economy remains heavily dependent on volatile oil and gas revenues. The government has continued efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector, but has had little success in reducing high unemployment and improving living standards. Other priority areas include banking reform, improving the investment environment, and reducing government bureaucracy.\n\nThe government has announced plans to sell off state enterprises: sales of a national cement factory and steel plant have been completed and other industries are up for offer. In 2001, Algeria signed an Association Agreement with the [[European Union]]. In June 1987, Algeria started accession negotiations for entry into the [[World Trade Organization]], but negotiations ceased in \t 2014.\n\n== Data ==\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132017.

Using purchasing power parity, estimated GDP was US$268.9 billion, or US$8,100 on a per capita basis. The estimated real growth rate was 4.6%. In 2007 industry accounted for 61% of GDP, services constituted 31%, and agriculture provided the remaining 8%.<ref name=cp11>Algeria country profile, p. 11.</ref>\n\nThe country has enjoyed several years of strong economic performance, with solid non-hydrocarbon growth, low inflation, an overall budget surplus of 8% of GDP and a positive trade balance of 28% of GDP in 2008. Average annual non-hydrocarbon GDP growth averaged 6 percent in 2003\u20132007, with total GDP growing at an average of 4.5% during the same period due to less buoyant oil production in 2006-07. \n\nAfter having virtually eliminated external debt before 2013, the drop hydrocarbon prices and revenues has led to a large budget deficit which has been only partly offset by spending cuts. Consequently government debt has increased to more than 30% of GDP. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/algeria/government-debt--of-nominal-gdp|title=Algeria Government Debt: % of GDP [1997 - 2019] [Data & Charts]|website=www.ceicdata.com|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref> Inflation has remained at 3-6% on average for 2013-17.

It is supplemented by consumer [[subsidy|subsidies]].

As a result, some 45 percent of food is imported. The primary crops are wheat, barley, and potatoes. Farmers also have had success growing dates for export. Cultivation is concentrated in the fertile coastal plain of the Tell region, which represents just a slice of Algeria's total territory. Altogether, only about 3 percent of Algerian territory is arable. Even in the Tell, rainfall variability has a significant impact on production. Government efforts to stimulate farming in the less arable steppe and desert regions have met with limited success. However, herdsmen maintain livestock, specifically  cow and sheep in the High Plateaus region.<ref>Algeria country profile, pp. 11\u201312.</ref>\n \nAlgeria's climate and periodic fires are not conducive to a thriving forestry industry. However, Algeria is a producer of cork and Aleppo pine. In 2005 roundwood removals totaled 7.8 million cubic meters, while sawnwood production amounted to only 13 million cubic meters per year.<ref name= cpd >Algeria country profile, p. 12.</ref>\n \nAlgeria's [[fishing industry]] does not take full advantage of the Mediterranean coast, in part because fishing is generally done from small family-owned boats instead of large commercial fishing trawlers. However, the government is attempting to boost the relatively small catch\u2014slightly more than 125,000 metric tons in 2005\u2014by modernizing fishing ports, permitting foreigners to fish in Algerian waters, and subsidizing fishing-related projects.<ref name= cpd/>\n\n===Fishing===\nFishing is a flourishing but minor industry. Fish caught are principally [[sardine]]s, [[bonito]], [[mackerel]] [[smelt (fish)|smelt]] and [[sprat]]s. Fresh fish are exported to [[France]], dried and preserved fish to [[Spain]] and [[Italy]]. Coral [[fishery|fisheries]] are found along the coast from [[Annaba|Bona]] to [[Tunis]].  The annual catch averages around 142,000 tons, 54% sardines.\n\n===Minerals===\n{{Main|Mining in Algeria}}\nAlgeria is rich in minerals; the country has many iron, [[lead]], zinc, [[copper]], [[Calamine (mineral)|calamine]], [[antimony]] and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] mines. The most productive are those of iron and zinc. Lignite is found in Algiers; immense phosphate beds were discovered near [[T\u00e9bessa]] in 1891, yielding 313,500 tons in 1905. Phosphate beds are also worked near [[S\u00e9tif]], [[Guelma]] and [[A\u00efn Be\u00efda, Oum El Bouaghi|A\u00efn Be\u00efda]]. There are more than 300 quarries which produce, amongst other stones, [[onyx]] and white and red [[marble]]s. Algerian onyx from Ain Tekbalet was used by the Romans, and many ancient quarries have been found near [[Sidi Ben Yebka]], some being certainly those from which the long-lost Numidian marbles were taken. [[Salt]] is collected on the margins of the chotts.\n\n===Banking and finance===\n{{See also|Bank of Algeria}}\nAlgeria's banking sector is dominated by public banks, which suffer from high levels of non-performing loans to state-owned enterprises (SOEs). As of 2007, public banks controlled 95 percent of total bank assets. In 2007 nonperforming loans represented a towering 38 percent of total loans at public banks, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates. Modest progress has been made in implementing several reforms proposed by the IMF, including replacing bank credits to SOEs with government subsidies; boosting bank supervision, accountability, and transparency; and modernizing the payments system. One specific reform that has been achieved is the establishment in 2006 of the Algerian Real Time Settlements system, which facilitates the prompt and reliable electronic transfer of payments. In November 2007, the proposed sale and privatization of Cr\u00e9dit Populaire d\u2019Alg\u00e9rie was postponed because of turbulent market conditions. Recently, HSBC and Deutsche Bank announced that they would commence commercial banking (in the case of HSBC) and investment banking (in the case of Deutsche Bank) in Algeria. Only a few companies are listed on the underdeveloped and relatively opaque Algiers stock exchange.<ref name= cpd/>\nThe non-bank sector remains less developed, although recent reforms in the field of regulation and supervision have laid the foundations for leasing, factoring, and venture capital.\n\nThe Algerian equity market remains relatively shallow, with only two companies being listed in the Bourse d\u2019Algerie. Conversely, the bond market has expanded in recent years: the government has issued debt instruments with varying maturities of up to fifteen years, and five private companies have issued corporate bonds.\n\nThe insurance sector was liberalized in 1995, but is still dominated by government-owned institutions and so far accounts only for a very small part of the economy: total premium volume amounted to approximately 1 percent of GDP. The pension sector encompasses three pension funds, which attained coverage of approximately 40 percent of the working population in 2005.\n\nBased on 2006 and 2007 estimates, 31 percent of the total population has access to financial services, with one bank branch or post office every 7,250 inhabitants. The microfinance sector still has great potential for further development. A 2006 study could not find major regulatory impediments to microfinance and suggested that the geographical net of postal offices \u2013 offering an increasing number of financial services to customers \u2013 holds a high potential of increasing access to finance for the Algerian population.\n\t \nOfficial remittance inflows increased steadily from US$1.9 to 2.9 billion between 2005 and 2007.<ref name=\"MFW4A Algeria Country Profile\"/>\n\n===Tourism===\n{{Main|Tourism in Algeria}}\nAlgeria's tourism industry, which contributes only about 1 percent of GDP, lags behind that of its neighbors Morocco and Tunisia. Algeria receives only about 200,000 tourists and visitors annually. Ethnic Algerian French citizens represent the largest group of tourists, followed by Tunisians. The modest level of tourism is attributable to a combination of poor hotel accommodations and the threat of terrorism. However, the government has adopted a plan known as \u201cHorizon 2025,\u201d which is designed to address the lack of infrastructure. Various hotel operators are planning to build hotels, particularly along the Mediterranean coast. Another potential opportunity involves adventure holidays in the south. The Algerian government has set the goal of boosting the number of foreign visitors, including tourists, to 1.2 million by 2010.<ref name= cpd/>\n\n===Other industries===\nAlgeria has many diversified industries that contribute to meet local demands and some times to exportation. The food industry is one of the largest industrial sector in Algeria. Private companies generally dominate the food sector in Algeria with large companies such as Cevital, La Belle, Groupe Bimo, Hamoud Boualam, Ifri, G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Emballage.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry is also present in Algeria, with the domination of state-owned company Saidal, as well as other small private companies. The local pharmaceutical industry covers 38% of local needs.\n\nThe mechanical industry has existed in Algeria for a long time, with the state-owned company SNVI (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des V\u00e9hicules Industriels) being the largest producer of buses and industrial vehicles in the region. These vehicles are exported to the Maghreb, Africa, and the Middle East. Mercedes-Benz has also invested in Algeria in cooperation with a state-owned company to produce industrial and military vehicles. Deutz AG also invested to produce agricultural utilities.\n\nIn the electric and electronic industry, Algeria has made a great leap in the field compared to its neighbours. The Algerian region Bordj-Bou-Arreridj is the biggest electronic pole in Africa, local companies cover 83% of it needs and export other products, Algeria started producing some 100% home made electronic product including smartphones, tablets, TV, TV decoders, air conditioning products ..., at least 16 big companies are active in the field, some of the companies are : Bya Electronic, HB Technologies, ZALA Computer, Cristor, Condor, Cobra, Continental \u00e9lectronique, Essalem Electronics, Samha, FRIGOR, BMS Electric, Bomare Company, etc.\n\n==Currency, exchange rate, and inflation==\nAlgeria's currency is the [[Algerian dinar|dinar]] (DZD). The dinar is loosely linked to the U.S. dollar in a managed float. Algeria's main export, crude oil, is priced in dollars, while most of Algeria's imports are priced in euros. Therefore, the government endeavors to manage fluctuations in the value of the dinar. As of April 2008, US$1 was equivalent to about DZD 64.6.<ref name=cp15/>\n \nAlgeria's foreign currency reserves have grown rapidly since 2000, reflecting rising prices for exported oil. At the end of 2007, foreign reserves totaled US$99.3 billion, up from US$12 billion in 2000 and the equivalent of almost four years of imports.<ref name=cp15/> In 2007 the estimated inflation rate was 4.6 percent.<ref name=cp11/>\n\nIn 2010, the IMF voiced concerns about poor management of Algeria's monetary system and inflation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.echoroukonline.com/eng/business/10996-imf-report-algerian-monetary-system-going-from-bad-to-worse.html|accessdate=2010-10-31|title=Echorouk Online - IMF report: Algerian monetary system going from bad to worse|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724173616/http://www.echoroukonline.com/eng/business/10996-imf-report-algerian-monetary-system-going-from-bad-to-worse.html|archive-date=2011-07-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2014, a report focusing on world economic projections was published by the IMF, according to which it was predicted that, in 2015, Algeria's economic growth would fall by 1.5%, while unemployment would rise by 1.2%.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fanack|title=Algeria\u2019s Struggling Economy in Perspective|url=https://chronicle.fanack.com/algeria/economy/algerias-struggling-economy-in-perspective/|website=Fanack.com|accessdate=27 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Labor==\n{{See also|Trade unions in Algeria}}\nThe largest employer is government, which claims 32 percent of the workforce. Even though industry is a much larger part of the economy than agriculture, agriculture employs slightly more people (14 percent of the workforce) than industry (13.4 percent of the workforce). One of the reasons for this disparity is that the energy sector is very capital-intensive. Trade accounts for 14.6 percent of the workforce, while the construction and public works sector employs 10 percent, reflecting the government's efforts to upgrade the country's infrastructure and stock of affordable housing.<ref name=cp13>Algeria country profile, p. 13.</ref>\n\nUnemployment has remained at levels around 10% since 2010 but is significantly higher for youth (24.8%) and women (16.3%)<ref>Algeria Overview, World Bank (31 March 2015) http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/algeria/overview</ref>\n \nAt the end of 2006, the unemployment rate was about 15.7 percent, but the rate among those under the age of 25 was 70 percent. In 2005 the labor participation rate was only 52 percent, versus an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average of 70 percent. New entrants to the workforce and the lack of emigration options make unemployment a chronic problem and an important challenge to the government. Given its highly capital-intensive nature, the hydrocarbons industry is not in a position to employ many job seekers.<ref name=cp13/>\n\n==Foreign economic relations==\nAlgeria is seeking more trade and foreign investment. For example, the hydrocarbons law passed in April 2005 is designed to encourage foreign investment in energy exploration. Increased production could raise Algeria's profile as a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. In keeping with its pro-trade agenda, Algeria achieved association status with the European Union (EU) in September 2005. Over a 12-year period, the association agreement is expected to enable Algeria to export goods to the EU tariff-free, while it gradually lifts tariffs on imports from the EU. Algeria has signed bilateral investment agreements with 20 different nations, including many European countries, China, Egypt, Malaysia, and Yemen. In July 2001, the United States and Algeria agreed on a framework for discussions leading to such an agreement, but a final treaty has not yet been negotiated. Ultimately, trade liberalization, customs modernization, deregulation, and banking reform are designed to improve the country's negotiating position as it seeks accession to the World Trade Organization.<ref name=cp14>Algeria country profile, p. 14</ref>\n\nIn 2007 Algerian imports totaled US$26.08 billion. The principal imports were capital goods, foodstuffs, and consumer goods. The top import partners were France (22 percent), Italy (8.6 percent), China (8.5 percent), Germany (5.9 percent), Spain (5.9 percent), the United States (4.8 percent), and Turkey (4.5 percent). In 2007 Algeria exported US$63.3 billion, more than twice as much as it imported. Exports accounted for 30 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Hydrocarbon products constituted at least 95 percent of export earnings. The principal exports were petroleum, natural gas, and petroleum products. The top export partners were the United States (27.2 percent), Italy (17 percent), Spain (9.7 percent), France (8.8 percent), Canada (8.1 percent), and Belgium (4.3 percent). Algeria supplies 25 percent of the European Union's natural gas imports. In 2007 Algeria posted a positive merchandise trade balance of US$37.2 billion. In 2007 Algeria achieved a positive current account balance of US$31.5 billion. High prices for Algeria's energy exports are the main driver for the improvement in the \ncurrent account balance.<ref name=cp14/>\n\nAlgeria's trade surplus for 2010 rose to over $83.14 billion. The Algerian Centre for Information and Statistics Directorate of the Algerian Customs attribute this increase from the previous year to higher fuel revenue due to higher prices for a barrel of oil, and a slight decrease in imports of consumer non-food materials.  The center said that Algerian exports rose by 78.26% during the period from January to November 2010 from $27.51 billion to $44.4 billion during the same period in 2009. Imports grew by 89.1% from $43.36 billion to $76.35 billion between 2009 and 2010.<ref name=\"nuqudy.com\">{{cite web |url=http://nuqudy.com/201012272084/arab-markets/algeria-trade-surplus-oil-prices-consumer-products |title=Algeria's trade surplus |publisher=Nuqudy |accessdate=2010-12-29 |date=2010-12-27}}</ref>\n\nReflecting strong oil export revenues, external debt is on a downward trajectory. For example, these revenues facilitated early repayments of US$900 million in loans from the African Development Bank and Saudi Arabia. In March 2006, Algeria's purchase of 78 aircraft from Russia led to the cancellation of Algeria's entire debt to Russia. In 2006 external debt was estimated at US$4.4 billion, down from US$23.5 billion in 2003.<ref name=cp14/>\n \nIn 2006 foreign direct investment (FDI) in Algeria totaled US$1.8 billion. The petrochemical, transport, and utilities sectors have been recent beneficiaries of FDI. FDI into the oil sector was expected to rise as a result of a hydrocarbons law, approved in April 2005, that created a more even playing field for foreign oil companies to compete with Algeria's state-owned oil company, Sonatrach, for exploration and production contracts. Algeria also is seeking foreign investment in power and water systems.<ref name=cp14/>\n\nAs of August 2006, cumulative World Bank assistance to Algeria totaled US$5.9 billion, encompassing 72 projects. Currently, the World Bank is pursuing seven projects, specifically budget modernization, mortgage finance, natural disaster recovery, energy and mining, rural employment, telecommunications, and transportation. In 2005 economic assistance to Algeria from the United States amounted to US$4.4 million, most of which was attributable to the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and the remainder to International Military Education and Training (IMET). MEPI encourages economic, political, and educational reform in the Middle East. In 2006 IMET, which provides U.S. military training to foreign troops, had a budget of US$823 million. In 2005 the European Union contributed US$58 million to Algeria's economic development under the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.<ref name=cp15>Algeria country profile, p. 15.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Energy in Algeria]]\n*[[List of companies of Algeria]]\n* {{req|Poverty in Algeria}}<!--see [[:Category:Poverty by country]]-->\n* [[Taxation in Algeria]]\n* [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n===Works cited===\n*[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Algeria.pdf Algeria country profile].

The book's main theme is [[teenage pregnancy]] and it is written from the perspective of a teenager, Sam.\n\nThe book has a [[Contemporary Fantasy| Fantasy]] element: The protagonist repeatedly has prophetic dreams in which he is projected months or years forward into his future, finding himself in a radically different life situation and having to piece out how his life has changed (or is going to change) - without letting the people around his future self notice his ignorance. \n\n== Main characters ==\n\n*Sam Jones is a troubled 16-year-old skateboarder, Sam is scared and unprepared to be a father. His idol is [[Tony Hawk]]. He has a poster of him to whom he talks about skate tricks and his life.

He is a college professor.\n*Mark - The new boyfriend of Annie. It is revealed in a \"flash forward\" that Mark and Annie will raise another child together.\n*Rabbit - Sam's skater friend who apparently has subhuman intelligence and reasoning skills, with excellent skating skills.\n*Rubbish - Sam's other skater friend who is apparently smart, with horrible skating skills.\n*TH - Tony Hawk, his idol. Sam always talks to a poster of Tony that hangs in his room and Tony responds with a quote from his book.

She is the sister of Sam and therefore the aunt of Rufus.\n\n== Summary ==\n\nThe novel's protagonist is a troubled 16-year-old skateboarder, Sam, who lives in London, UK . His mother, Annie, gave birth to him when she was just 16.  They therefore have an unconventional relationship. He has a poster of Tony Hawk in his room that serves as his friend and confidant. Sam's two best friends are Rabbit and Rubbish, two skateboarders. Sam's father, Dave, is somewhat estranged from the family, visiting them only occasionally. After being introduced to Alicia at a party thrown by Annie's co-worker, Andrea, Sam and Alicia start dating. He believes he is in love with her and visits her numerous times, almost daily, in which they have sex several times. However, one time Sam and Alicia try having sex not wearing protection. Sam knows that due to him having sex with Alicia without a condom, she might be pregnant. He's just not ready to be a father.\n\nAfter a while, Sam gets bored of his relationship and decides to break up. A while later, Alicia calls him to meet so they can talk. Sam, realizing what news she has, has a prophetic dream of waking up next to Alicia in the future. She is ugly and heavy, and their baby, Roof, is loud and obnoxious. He attends the local college occasionally throughout the week, pursuing a career in art and design. Moreover, Annie is pregnant. Sam awakens the next morning. He is back to his normal time and presumes that he was sent in the future by the mystical powers of his Tony Hawk poster.\n\nIn fear of the obvious news that Alicia will give him, he runs away to [[Hastings]] and throws his mobile phone in the sea. Thinking he can make a permanent residence there, Sam goes to several attractions, only to be told there is no work. While in a seedy [[bed and breakfast]], Sam meets a rude old man, Mr Brady, that hires him as a helper with various day-to-day activities (helping him up and down the stairs, and retrieving his remote control). In the middle of the night, Mr Brady barges into his room demanding he helps him find the remote that has fallen behind his bed. Sam grudgingly retrieves it, only to decide that he no longer wants to stay in the town. \n\nHe returns home to Annie who has called the police. After spending some time with Annie, Sam and Alicia meet up and she reveals that she is in fact pregnant. Refusing to get an abortion, Alicia and Sam work up the nerve to tell Alicia's [[elitist]] parents, Andrea and Robert. Originally upset, Andrea and Robert try to convince Alicia to have an abortion. When Alicia refuses, Andrea and Robert lash out and blame Sam for ruining Alicia's life. Sam, Alicia, Andrea and Robert march over to Sam's apartment, only to find Annie with her new boyfriend Mark. When told of the pregnancy, Annie breaks down and cries, furious that Sam would ruin his life. \n\nThat night, Sam has another prophetic dream in which he takes Roof (the name, he finds, being a contractions of [[Rufus]]) to a doctor's appointment. Again, Sam has no idea how to take care of Roof and no idea what is going on. \nSam upsets his son Rufus, and he again, realizes he is not a suitable father. Fortunately, he meets with a young mother - whom he does not know, but who seems to know him - and gets her to show him how to change Roof's diapers, though she says \"But you are very good at doing it\". When waking up he realizes that, like it or not, he is going to have a life of taking care of his son. Gradually, he gets used to the idea.\n\nAs soon as Mark moves into their house, Annie becomes pregnant. Sam moves into Alicia's house only to find that he really isn't welcome there. He begins to take part-time college classes. He encounters one of Alicia's previous boyfriends who insinuates that Sam's son Rufus is actually his. He confronts Alicia when he believes that she conveniently made it look like it was his child - which she angrily disproves, but the scene adds to spoiling their relationship. \n\nHe moves back into his mother's apartment, resulting in him researching the internet for facts about teenage pregnancies. He discovers that 4/5 of male teenage parents lose contact with their children. He goes to Alicia's and begins to row with Alicia, resulting in her thinking he is seeing another girl. Eventually Alicia's parents clear the matter up. \n\nWhen Alicia's time comes, Sam is very confused, but eventually does manage in a credible way the role of being at her side. He then finds out the origin of the baby's name - when recovering from birth-giving Alicia was listening to [[Rufus Wainwright]]. It was Sam himself who changed it to \"Roof\". Soon afterwards, Sam's mother gives birth to a daughter, Emily - who is strictly Roof's aunt, though being a month younger than him. Sam gets involved in taking care of Emily, too.    \n\nSoon after this Sam and Alicia take Rufus out for the day with Alicia and Sam having sex later. Alicia's mum discovers them and gets particularly angry. Sam and Alicia finally confirm to each other they were from the beginning wrong for each other. \n\nThen Sam has a third prophetic dream, presumably a few years in the future. He wakes up with a beautiful girl he doesn't know. It is revealed she is his current girlfriend, Alex, as Alicia and he broke up. The two go to meet Alicia and her new boyfriend, Carl, in a restaurant. It is made clear that Alicia is the primary caretaker of the baby, but that she and Sam still have a friendly relationship.\n\n== Casual loop ==\n\nThe book's plot includes a [[causal loop]] - i.e. \"a paradox of [[time travel]] that occurs when a future event is the cause of a past event, which in turn is the cause of the future event.
