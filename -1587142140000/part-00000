In response to pathogenic tissue damage, ILCs contribute to immunity via the secretion of [[Cytokine|signalling molecules]], and the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune cells. ILCs are primarily tissue resident cells, found in both [[Lymphatic system|lymphoid]] (immune associated), and non- lymphoid tissues, and rarely in the peripheral blood. They are particularly abundant at mucosal surfaces, playing a key role in mucosal immunity and [[homeostasis]]. Characteristics allowing their differentiation from other immune cells include the absence of regular [[Lymphocyte|lymphoid morphology]], rearranged antigen receptors found on [[T cell receptor|T cells]] and [[B cell receptor|B cells]] (due to the lack of the [[recombination-activating gene| RAG]] gene), and phenotypic markers usually present on [[Myelocyte|myeloid]] or [[dendritic cell]]s. <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Spits | first1 = Hergen | last2 = Cupedo | first2 = Tom | year = 2012 | title = Innate lymphoid cells: emerging insights in development, lineage relationships, and function | url = | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 647\u2013675 | doi=10.1146/annurev-immunol-020711-075053 | pmid=22224763}}</ref>\n\nBased on the difference in developmental pathways, phenotype, and signalling molecules produced, in 2013, ILCs were divided into three groups: 1, 2 and 3, however, after further investigation, we now appreciate five distinct subsets within these groups: [[natural killer cell|NK cells]], ILC1s, ILC2s, ILC3s, and LTi cells.<ref name=\"SpitsArtis2013\">{{cite journal|last1=Spits|first1=Hergen|last2=Artis|first2=David|last3=Colonna|first3=Marco|last4=Diefenbach|first4=Andreas|last5=Di Santo|first5=James P.|last6=Eberl|first6=Gerard|last7=Koyasu|first7=Shigeo|last8=Locksley|first8=Richard M.|last9=McKenzie|first9=Andrew N.

our immune response to pathogens in all organs, in particular at mucosal surfaces. <ref name=\"Colonna2018\"/> They are key in the innate immune response due to their ability to rapidly secrete immunoregulatory cytokines, however, they also play a role in the shaping of the adaptive response by interacting with other immune cells. The microenvironment of the tissue they reside in determines and fine- tunes the expression of the diverse ILC profiles, facilitating their interaction in multiple effector functions. \n\nThe strategic positioning and deep rooting of ILCs within tissues allow them to maintain homeostasis, and therefore healthy tissue functioning.

Disturbance of the epithelium lining the hepatic [[bile duct]]s is frequently observed in response to chronic liver inflammation, and increased proliferation of these ducts is associated with liver cancer.<ref name=\"OchelTiegs2019\"/> Evidence suggests that the enhanced proliferation is triggered by IL-13, which is produced by IL-33 induced production of ILC2 cells. ILC2s have also been shown to enhance the progression of liver fibrosis, in turn promoting the development of liver cancer.<ref name=\"OchelTiegs2019\"/> \n\nThe availability of specific dietary nutrients can affect ILC immune homeostasis by altering the energy stored in the adipose tissue. Adipose tissue maintains metabolism homeostasis and is now considered a fully immunocompetent organ. [[Malnutrition]] and [[gluttony]] can dysregulate ILC responses via changes in dietary nutrients, having direct effects on the energy stored in the adipose tissue.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> Obesity is associated with changes of gastrointestinal flora, increased afflux of free [[fatty acid metabolism|fatty acids]] from adipose tissue into the liver and increased gut permeability.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> The close anatomical proximity of the gastrointestinal tract and the liver means transportation of bacterial metabolites through the [[portal vein]] triggers inflammation, acting on innate immune cells, including ILC1s, therefore playing an important role in the activation of an inflammatory state in the liver. Therefore, inflammation associated with obesity can influence the progression of liver disease, due to the development of insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> ILC1s as a key regulatory of adipose tissue inflammation, are therefore a potential therapeutic target for treating people with liver disease or [[metabolic syndrome]]. \n\nILC2s have also been identified in human and mouse [[white adipose tissue]], contributing to the development of obesity. Upon dysregulation of homeostasis in the adipose tissue, the decreased responses of ILC2s are a characteristic of obesity, as this interrupts their crucial role in energy homeostasis, resulting in reduced energy expenditure, and increased adiposity.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n=== Skin inflammation ===\n\nThe frequency of ILC2s is higher in the inflamed skin of patients with [[atopic dermatitis]] than in healthy patients.<ref name=\"EbboCrinier2017\"/> The ILC2s from the skin of the patients had upregulation of the IL-25, IL-33, TSLP and PGD2 receptors, suggesting their role in the activation of ILC2s.

The album was announced on 18 July 2012 and released on 24 September.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/iron-maidens-steve-harris-announces-first-ever-solo-album-british-lion/ |title=Iron Maiden's Steve Harris Announces First Ever Solo Album ''British Lion'' |magazine=[[Metal Hammer]] |date=18 July 2012 |accessdate=18 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223010938/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/iron-maidens-steve-harris-announces-first-ever-solo-album-british-lion/ |archivedate=23 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nFollowing the initial announcement of the album's release in July 2012, ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' revealed that the project originated with a band, named [[British Lion (Band)|British Lion]], which Harris had been mentoring in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/maidens-harris-announces-solo-album/ |title=Maiden's Harris announces solo album |accessdate=8 September 2012 |last=Kielty |first=Martin |date=18 July 2012 |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119104531/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/maidens-harris-announces-solo-album/ |archivedate=19 January 2013 }}</ref> Harris confirmed this during an interview with ''Classic Rock'' the following month, explaining that he became involved after \"Graham Leslie [guitar] came to me with a cassette of songs... and I thought they were really good, so I said I\u2019d try to help his band do something. I ended up managing them and producing them and writing with them.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/features/iron-maidens-steve-harris-on-british-lion-solo-project/ |title=Exclusive: Iron Maiden\u2019s Steve Harris talks about his British Lion solo project |accessdate=8 September 2012 |last=Brannigan |first=Paul |date=27 August 2012 |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020112709/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/features/iron-maidens-steve-harris-on-british-lion-solo-project/ |archivedate=20 October 2013 }}</ref> After the original band split up, he \"kept in touch with Richie [Taylor, vocals] and Graham, and then Richie was working with another guitarist called David Hawkins, who's a really talented guy, and so we started writing songs together.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\"/> After several years of work, due to Harris being occupied with Iron Maiden, the album ultimately consists of \"six songs written with Richie and David, there's one with just me and Richie, and the others are me, Richie, Graham and a couple of other guys that were around at the time.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\"/> In an interview published by ''[[Kerrang!]]'' in September, Harris said that he considers [[British Lion (Band)|British Lion]] \"more of a side-project\" than a solo record.<ref name=\"kerrang lion\"/>\n\nStylistically, Harris argues that the record is \"more mainstream rock than metal, very British sounding, very 70s-influenced and quite commercial\u2026 but good commercial. There's all kinds of stuff going on, with nods to [[the Who]] and [[UFO (band)|UFO]] and some classic British rock bands, but it's not the progressive rock album some might be expecting.\"<ref

as letting his strings \"go dead\".<ref>{{cite episode | title = Iron Maiden | series = [[That Metal Show]] | serieslink =  | credits = [[Eddie Trunk]], [[Jim Florentine]], [[Don Jamieson

stage, remarking that, although \"there are no shows arranged yet\", \"I know we\u2019ll be playing clubs, which is great because I\u2019ve not played clubs for years\", and that he intends to release

Prior to the formalization of St. Duthus FC as an [[association football]] club, various combinations began playing informal [[Association football|association]] or [[Rugby union|rugby]] [[football]] matches using the St. Duthus name from the 1870s onwards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001911/18780208/073/0003|title=Football {{!}} British Newspaper Archive|last=Archive|first=The British Newspaper|date=1878-02-08|website=www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-09-20}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Pre-War ===\nOfficially formed in 1885 as an offshoot of St Duthus Cricket Club, St. Duthus Football Club began their existence under the [[Association football|association code]] by playing friendly matches against neighbouring towns and villages as founder members of the Ross-shire branch of the [[Scottish Junior Football Association]].  The \"Saints\" played in red and white vertical stripes throughout their formative years playing at the Links Playing Fields.\n\nIn 1895, St. Duthus played competitively for the first time in both the [[Pattison's whisky|Pattisons]]' Challenge Cup and the Ross-shire Junior Cup.  It was not until 1919\u201320 that they would compete for league honours, when they became the winners of the Ross-shire Junior League at the first time of asking following the association's restart at the end of the [[World War I|First World War]].\n\nIn 1924\u201325, St. Duthus won the North of Scotland Junior Cup \u2013 at the time the highest accolade for teams playing the junior association code in the [[Highlands and Islands (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Highlands]].\n\nFollowing the death of long time club President The Count de Serra Largo, the club fell into abeyance in 1932 before returning in 1934 with a newly formed committee, now playing in team colours of horizontal black and white hoops.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ross-shire Football's Forgotten Pioneers|last=Harkiss|first=Niall|publisher=K & N Publishing|year=2014|isbn=978-0992882518|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1938, the club prepared an application to join the [[Highland Football League]] ahead of the 1939-40 season, but problems arranging an enclosed ground halted their plans before the club once again fell into inactivity during the Second World War.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/account/register?countrykey=0&showgiftvoucherclaimingoptions=false&gift=false&nextpage=%2faccount%2flogin%3freturnurl%3d%252fviewer%252fbl%252f0000577%252f19381119%252f016%252f0004&rememberme=false&cookietracking=false&partnershipkey=0&newsletter=false&offers=false&registerreason=none&showsubscriptionoptions=false&showcouponmessaging=false&showfreetrialmessaging=false&showregisteroptions=false&showloginoptions=false&isonlyupgradeable=false|title=Register {{!}} British Newspaper Archive|website=www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\n=== After the War ===\nBack in their traditional colours of red and white, St. Duthus resumed competition in 1947, combining their own pre-war committee with war-time outfit Eastern Rose F.C., who had played for one season in the Ross-shire Junior League in 1946.  From 1947 onwards, St. Duthus FC competed as a member of the Ross-shire Junior League until the league was reformed in the late 1950s as the [[Ross-shire Welfare Football Association|Ross-shire Welfare League]].

The \"Saints\" played in red and white vertical stripes throughout their formative years playing at the Links Playing Fields.\n\nIn 1895, St. Duthus played competitively for the first time in both the [[Pattison's whisky|Pattisons]]' Challenge Cup and the Ross-shire Junior Cup.
