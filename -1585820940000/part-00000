It was released on August 23, 2019, through [[Republic Records]]. As the [[executive producer]], Swift worked with producers [[Jack Antonoff]], [[Louis Bell]], [[Frank Dukes]] and [[Joel Little]] on the album. Described by Swift as \"a love letter to love itself\", the album celebrates the ups and downs of love, incorporating brighter and cheerful tones, departing from the dark sounds of its predecessor, ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017). The album's cover art and music videos marked a change in Swift's visual appearance, which now embodies a [[summer]] aesthetic, consisting mainly of [[Pastel (color)|pastel colors]]. Musically, it is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[synth-pop]], [[electropop]] and [[pop rock]] record that contains influences of [[Country music|country]], [[dream pop]], [[bubblegum pop]], [[funk]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[pop punk]] and [[indie pop]].\n\n''Lover'' features collaborations with the [[Dixie Chicks]] and [[Brendon Urie]] of [[Panic! at the Disco]]. It was preceded by three singles, all peaking inside the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; \"[[Me!]]\" and \"[[You Need to Calm Down]]\" peaked at number two, while the [[Lover (Taylor Swift song)|title track]] reached number 10. All 18 tracks of the album charted simultaneously on the Hot 100 chart upon the album's release. \"[[The Man (Taylor Swift song)|The Man]]\" was released as the fourth single on January 27, 2020. The album received positive reviews from critics, who commended Swift's songwriting conveying emotional maturity and honesty. However, a few commentators found the album \"lengthy\" and \"inconsistent\" in places.\n\n''Lover'' debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, moving 867,000 units in its first week. It also debuted at number one in many countries including Australia, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the UK. ''Lover'' was certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for moving over 2 million units in the US. It was the best selling album of 2019 in the country. Globally, ''Lover'' was the best selling album by a solo artist of 2019. As of January 2020, it has sold over 3.2 million pure copies worldwide. To promote the album, Swift is set to embark on the [[Lover Fest]], her sixth [[concert tour]] and first [[music festival]] tour, beginning on June 20, 2020.\n\n''Lover'' received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]] at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards|62nd Grammy Awards]], which is Swift's third consecutive nomination in the category, following ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014) and ''Reputation'' (2017), while its singles \"You Need to Calm Down\" and \"Lover\" were nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance|Best Pop Solo Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], respectively. The album appeared on numerous year-end best music lists of 2019.\n\n==Background==\nSpeculation of the album started on February 24, 2019, when Swift posted a photo of seven palm trees to her [[Instagram]] account,<ref>{{cite web |last=Elizabeth |first=De |title=Taylor Swift Might Have Just Dropped a Huge Clue About Her Next Album |url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/taylor-swift-instagram-palm-trees-fan-theories-next-album |website=Teen Vogue |accessdate=July 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190326190044/https://www.teenvogue.com/story/taylor-swift-instagram-palm-trees-fan-theories-next-album |archive-date=March 26, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> which the singer later confirmed was the day she finished the album.<ref name=\"EWMay\">{{cite magazine|last=Suskind|first=Alex|title=New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7, fan theories, and her next era|url=https://ew.com/music/2019/05/09/taylor-swift-cover-story/|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=August 17, 2019|date=May 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812135902/https://ew.com/music/2019/05/09/taylor-swift-cover-story/|archive-date=August 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On April 13, Swift released a countdown on her official website, counting down to midnight [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] ([[UTC\u221204:00]]) on April 26.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8506993/taylor-swift-countdown-clock-april-26|title=Taylor Swift Updates Her Website With Countdown Clock, Teases April 26 Date|first=Katie|last=Atkinson|website=Billboard|date=April 13, 2019|accessdate=July 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416134018/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8506993/taylor-swift-countdown-clock-april-26|archive-date=April 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> At midnight, she released the album's lead single, \"[[Me!]]\" featuring [[Brendon Urie]] of [[Panic! at the Disco]], along with its accompanying music video.<ref name=\"CNN\" /> Swift encouraged fans to find hints about the album title in the video and many fans pointed out that at one point in the video, the word \"Lover\" appeared on a neon light up sign at the top of a building in the background.<ref>{{cite web |last=Walsh |first=Savannah |title=Taylor Swift's New Album Title Hint Suggests That Apparently Fans May Already Know It |url=https://www.bustle.com/p/taylor-swifts-new-album-title-hint-suggests-that-apparently-fans-may-already-know-it-17921363 |website=Bustle |accessdate=June 21, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621150341/https://www.bustle.com/p/taylor-swifts-new-album-title-hint-suggests-that-apparently-fans-may-already-know-it-17921363 |archive-date=June 21, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn June 13, 2019, she confirmed the album title in a live stream on Instagram, and that the album would be released on August 23, 2019.<ref name=\"release\">{{cite web|url=https://time.com/5606187/taylor-swift-album-release-date-2019/|first=Raisa|last=Bruner|title=Taylor Swift Just Announced the Summer Release Date for Her New Album Lover and Next Song|date=June 13, 2019|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=June 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190613235726/https://time.com/5606187/taylor-swift-album-release-date-2019/|archive-date=June 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Swift also announced that the album's second single, \"[[You Need to Calm Down]]\", would be released the next day on June 14, followed by its music video three days later.<ref name=\"billboardpop\">{{cite web |last=Atkinson |first=Katie |title=Taylor Swift Announces New Song 'You Need to Calm Down' & 'Lover' Album Release Date |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8515910/taylor-swift-you-need-to-calm-down-lover-album-release-date-cover |website=Billboard |date=June 13, 2019 |accessdate=June 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190614004337/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8515910/taylor-swift-you-need-to-calm-down-lover-album-release-date-cover |archive-date=June 14, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> She described the album as a romantic one, stating that it was \"not just simply thematically, like it's all love songs or something.

It was released on August 23, 2019, through [[Republic Records]]. As the [[executive producer]], Swift worked with producers [[Jack Antonoff]], [[Louis Bell]], [[Frank Dukes]] and [[Joel Little]] on the album. Described by Swift as \"a love letter to love itself\", the album celebrates the ups and downs of love, incorporating brighter and cheerful tones, departing from the dark sounds of its predecessor, ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017). The album's cover art and music videos marked a change in Swift's visual appearance, which now embodies a [[summer]] aesthetic, consisting mainly of [[Pastel (color)|pastel colors]]. Musically, it is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[synth-pop]], [[electropop]] and [[pop rock]] record that contains influences of [[Country music|country]], [[dream pop]], [[bubblegum pop]], [[funk]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[pop punk]] and [[indie pop]].\n\n''Lover'' features collaborations with the [[Dixie Chicks]] and [[Brendon Urie]] of [[Panic! at the Disco]]. It was preceded by three singles, all peaking inside the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; \"[[Me!]]\" and \"[[You Need to Calm Down]]\" peaked at number two, while the [[Lover (Taylor Swift song)|title track]] reached number 10. All 18 tracks of the album charted simultaneously on the Hot 100 chart upon the album's release. \"[[The Man (Taylor Swift song)|The Man]]\" was released as the fourth single on January 27, 2020. The album received positive reviews from critics, who commended Swift's songwriting conveying emotional maturity and honesty. However, a few commentators found the album \"lengthy\" and \"inconsistent\" in places.\n\n''Lover'' debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, moving 867,000 units in its first week. It also debuted at number one in many countries including Australia, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the UK. ''Lover'' was certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for moving over 2 million units in the US.

The [[sixth form]] is coeducational.\n\n==Admissions==\nAdmittance to the school is by entrance exam taken at the age of 10/11. Since September 2016, 150 pupils enter the school in September each year, increased gradually from 96 in September 2012. The school has grown from 718 in 2011 to 1,090 in 2019, as a consequence of this sustained expansion.\n\nThere is separate admission into the Sixth Form based on academic performance at GCSE. As of 2019, there are over 400 students on roll in the Sixth Form. At this stage of the school, girls are also admitted.\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation===\nIt was founded in 1554 by George and Nicolas Hawe, two leading townsmen, with [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]] as its royal patron and benefactor.<ref name=Anderson/> At this time it had about sixty pupils, all boys, and taught [[Classics]] almost exclusively.\n\n===New sites===\nIt has grown significantly since its foundation and moved three times. Originally housed in an old town guild-hall near St Matthew's Parish church, it moved to Park Street in 1811, into new buildings in Lichfield Street in 1850 (a site now used by Queen Mary's High School for Girls) and finally to a purpose-built school on the Mayfield site in 1965.<ref>Fink, D.P.J.

The extra funds from this have, amongst other things, facilitated the building of a new wing of the school buildings. The school recently completed work on a new sports hall to support the current gym and swimming facilities. The Science Block was also updated, with new Biology labs being built. A new sixth form block has been constructed and it opened late September 2012. The School is rated as 'Outstanding' by [[Ofsted]].\n\n==Traditions==\nThe school's badge is based on the [[Heraldic badge]] of Queen Mary and reflects her parentage, being formed from half a [[Tudor rose]] (a symbol of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]) [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaled]] with a sheaf of arrows (a symbol of [[Catherine of Aragon|Katharine of Aragon]]). The badge was modified slightly during the 2006/2007 school year. A fully red rose was changed to an accurate red and white Tudor rose, which is usually shown with a red outer rose and a white inner one. However the school's Tudor rose, based on early school records, has a white outer rose and a red inner one,<ref name=Anderson>Anderson, J.S. (2004) \"Queen Mary's 1954-2004\".

Pupils regularly collaborate to stage plays and the two schools participate in a German exchange every year with a school in the town of [[Biedenkopf]].\n\nMany trips are run throughout the year, many of them international.  Pupils in recent years have had the opportunity to travel to places such as France, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Italy, New Zealand, China, Morocco, Iceland and Alabama, USA.\n\nIn sport, the school's Under 18 and Under 16 hockey teams both won the Staffordshire Cup for their respective age groups in the same season.\n\n[http://www.qmgs.walsall.sch.uk QMGS] also hosted the national finals of [[Schools' Challenge|Junior Schools' Challenge]] quiz on 24 June 2007, with a team from the school winning the Plate Final. In 2008, the school hosted and reached the national final, losing in the final. In 2012, they hosted a semi-final against Hereford Cathedral School, losing by only one question (610-600).\n\nThe school is the only school in the country to have won the [[UKMT]] Junior Maths Team Competition twice, doing so in successive years. The competition attracts over 1000 schools every year.\n\nThe school has a plaque in St George's Church, Ypres, to honour the ex-pupils of the school who died in the Ypres Salient and the Somme, during World War One. The plaque was paid for by the QM Club and was formally unveiled during a Year 9 Battlefields trip. QMGS was the last school ever to be allowed to have a plaque.\n\nEvery year, Year 7 and the senior prefects visit [[Westminster Abbey]], [[London]] to commemorate their founder on the Friday closest to 6 July.\n\n==Project Horizon==\nProject [http://horizon.qmgs.walsall.sch.uk Horizon] is the school's [[near space]] programme, founded in 2012, which runs annual missions. Founded by Mr Adam Coghlan, it has now been taken over by Mr Mario Sepede. A small [[payload]] carrying cameras and tracking hardware are lifted by a [[high-altitude balloon]] filled with helium gas into the [[stratosphere]] until the balloon bursts, allowing the payload to descend back to the ground. Film footage and still images of the payload's journey are recorded throughout the entire flight, capturing views of Earth from the stratosphere.\n\nThe Project has received national media attention, including appearances on the BBC and ITV.
