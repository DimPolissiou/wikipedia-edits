The title track of Bowie's third studio album [[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|of the same name]], it was released in November 1970 in the US and in April 1971 in the UK by [[Mercury Records]]. Produced by [[Tony Visconti]], it was recorded at [[Trident Studios|Trident]] and [[Advision Studios]] in London in May 1970, towards the end of the album's sessions; Bowie recorded his vocal on the final day of mixing for the album, reflecting his generally dismissive attitude during the sessions. Musically, it is based around a \"circular\" guitar riff from [[Mick Ronson]]. Its lyrics are cryptic and evocative, being inspired by numerous poems including ''The Psychoed'' by [[William Hughes Mearns]]. Bowie's vocals are heavily \"phased\" throughout and have been described as \"haunting\".\n\n\"The Man Who Sold the World\" went relatively unnoticed upon initial release in 1970. It was never released as a [[Single (music)|single]] but appeared as a B-side on the 1973 reissues of \"[[Space Oddity]]\" in the US and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in the UK by [[RCA Records]]. It wasn't until it was covered by English singer [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], whose 1974 recording, produced by Bowie and Ronson, peaked at No. 3 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and brought the song mainstream attention. In subsequent decades, the song has been covered by Scottish musician [[Midge Ure]] in 1982 and the American rock band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] in 1993, whose performance of the song for the television programme ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' introduced it to a new audience. Many critics have noted that cover versions of the track have managed to outshine Bowie's original recording in popularity, with some, including Bowie himself, noting that many listeners don't know Bowie wrote it. Others have commended these covers as saving the song from obscurity.\n\nRetrospectively, Bowie's original recording has been named one of his best songs, with many praising the haunting and unsettling nature of the recording. Bowie performed the track live later in his career in different renditions than the original, including in a darker style during 1995's [[Outside Tour]]; a studio recording of the tour's arrangement appeared as a B-side in 1995. He again re-recorded the song in an acoustic arrangement in 1996 for the documentary ''ChangesNowBowie'', which was released in 2020 on the EP ''Is It Any Wonder?''. The original recording has since on multiple [[compilation album]]s and has been remastered multiple times, including in 2015 as part of the box set ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]''.\n\n==Composition and recording==\nThe backing track for \"The Man Who Sold the World\" was recorded at [[Trident Studios]] in London on 4 May 1970, along with other album track \"Running Gun Blues\". At this point, the track was recorded under the working title \"Saviour Machine\" and did not contain the title phrase.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=191\u2013192}} According to Kevin Cann, the lineup featured Bowie on acoustic guitar, [[Mick Ronson]] on electric guitar, producer [[Tony Visconti]] on bass, [[Woody Woodmansey]] on drums and percussion, and Ralph Mace on [[Moog synthesiser]]; Ronson and Woodmansey would later become famous as a part of [[the Spiders from Mars]].{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=210\u2013211}} According to Visconti, Bowie recorded his vocal on 22 May at [[Advision Studios]], the final day of mixing for the album which, when traveling to Advision, Bowie had intended to name ''Metrobolist'', an homage to [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=193}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=316}} Bowie's last-minute addition frustrated Visconti, who recalled in 1977: \"This was the beginning of [Bowie's] new style of writing \u2013 'I can't be bothered until I have to'. When it was finished, on the last day of the last mix, I remember telling David, 'I've had it, I can't work like this anymore \u2013 I'm through...David was very disappointed.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=193\u2013194}} This frustration was mostly due in part to his dissatisfaction with the recording sessions: he was mostly in charge of budget and production, as well as maintaining Bowie's interest in the project. Bowie later told [[BBC Radio 1]]'s Stuart Grundy in 1976: \"It was a nightmare, that album. I hated the actual process of making it.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=210}}\n\nBowie's original recording is described by author [[Peter Doggett]] as \"enigmatic\", while Nicholas Pegg describes it as giving an \"unassuming air of pathos and menace\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=103}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=316}} Doggett notes that the track contains none of the \"metallic theatrics\" that are found on the rest of the album.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=104}} Musically, the song opens with a repeating electric guitar riff from Ronson with an acoustic guitar from Bowie underneath it. The chord structure is in the key of F with an A major chord \"borrowed\" from the D minor scale.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=104}} Throughout the song, Visconti's bass \"runs scales\" under the chorus and a melody \"elsewhere\", Woodmansey plays \"ecstatic\" drum fills deep in the mix and Latin-style percussion \"trembling\" on the surface; Ronson uses [[Feedback (music)|feedback]] to introduce the chorus.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=104}} Bowie's vocals are \"heavily phased\" during the verses and briefly doubled (which, in Bowie's words, \"came as some surprise\"), compressed and again double-tracked during the chorus, before bursting into a \"haunting chorale\" during the final refrains.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=104}} [[Douglas Wolk]] of ''Rolling Stone'' similarly calls Bowie's vocals and lyrics \"haunting\".<ref name=\"Wolk RS\">{{cite web |last1=Wolk |first1=Douglas |authorlink1=Douglas Wolk |title=How David Bowie Realized Theatrical Dreams on 'The Man Who Sold the World' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/how-david-bowie-realized-theatrical-dreams-on-the-man-who-sold-the-world-121178/ |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=4 April 2020 |date=4 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215092733/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/how-david-bowie-realized-theatrical-dreams-on-the-man-who-sold-the-world-121178/ |archive-date=15 February 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> Pegg describes the guiro percussion as \"sinister\", the guitar riff \"circular\" and Bowie's vocal \"ghostly\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=316}}\n\n==Title and lyrics==\n{{quote box|quoted = 1|quote=I guess I wrote it because there was a part of myself that I was looking for \u2026 that song for me always exemplified kind of how you feel when you're young, when you know there's a piece of yourself that you haven't really put together yet \u2013 you have this great searching, this great need to find out who you really are.|source=\u2014[[David Bowie]], in an interview for the [[BBC Radio 1]] programme ''ChangesNowBowie'' (1997)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.teenagewildlife.com/Appearances/Radio/1997/0108/radio1-transcript.html |title=ChangesNowBowie Transcript \u2013 Radio 1 |first=Grant |last=Wallace |date=27 June 1999 |accessdate=19 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902074027/http://www.teenagewildlife.com/Appearances/Radio/1997/0108/radio1-transcript.html |archive-date=2 September 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>|width=24%|align=left|style=padding:8px;|border=1px|salign=left}}\n\nAccording to Doggett, the song's title has multiple \"precursors\": including a 1949 [[Robert A.

Pegg suggests that the title partly reflects an element of \"self-disgust\" Bowie has over the thought of \"losing control\" and \"selling\" his private life via profoundly personal music.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=317}}\n\nThe lyrics are noted as very cryptic and evocative; in Doggett's words, \"begging but defying interpretation.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=103}} Like most of his work during this period, Bowie frequently avoided giving a direct interpretation of the lyrics; he later remarked that he felt it was unfair to give it to [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]] in 1973 because it dealt with the \"devils and angels\" within himself (she later confessed she \"had no idea what it meant\").{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=316}} Bowie once stated that the song was a sequel to \"[[Space Oddity]]\" which, in Doggett's words, is \"an explanation designed to distract rather than enlighten\", quoting the lyrics \"Who knows? Not me\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=103}} The song's narrator has an encounter with a kind of [[doppelg\u00e4nger]], as suggested in the second chorus where \"I never lost control\" is replaced with \"We never lost control\".<ref>{{Cite book| contribution=Future Legends: David Bowie and Science Fiction| last=King| first=Maureen| editor-last=Morrison| editor-first=Michael A.| title=Trajectories of the Fantastic: Selected Essays from the Fourteenth International Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts| publisher=Greenwood| year=1997| location=Westport, Connecticut| page=131}}</ref> Beyond this, the episode is unexplained: as James E.

P.

World'''\" is a song written and recorded by English singer-songwriter [[David Bowie]]. The title track of Bowie's third studio album [[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|of the same name]], it was released in November 1970 in the US and in April 1971 in the UK by [[Mercury Records]]. Produced by [[Tony Visconti]], it was recorded at [[Trident Studios|Trident]] and [[Advision Studios]] in London in May 1970, towards the end of the album's sessions; Bowie recorded his vocal on the final day of mixing for the album, reflecting his generally dismissive attitude during the sessions. Musically, it is based around a \"circular\" guitar riff from [[Mick Ronson]]. Its lyrics are cryptic and evocative, being inspired by numerous poems including ''The Psychoed'' by [[William Hughes Mearns]]. Bowie's vocals are heavily \"phased\" throughout and have been described as \"haunting\".\n\n\"The Man Who Sold the World\" went relatively unnoticed upon initial release in 1970. It was never released as a [[Single (music)|single]] but appeared as a B-side on the 1973 reissues of \"[[Space Oddity]]\" in the US and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in the UK by [[RCA Records]]. It wasn't until it was covered by English singer [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], whose 1974 recording, produced by Bowie and Ronson, peaked at No. 3 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and brought the song mainstream attention. In subsequent decades, the song has been covered by Scottish musician [[Midge Ure]] in 1982 and the American rock band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] in 1993, whose performance of the song for the television programme ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' introduced it to a new audience. Many critics have noted that cover versions of the track have managed to outshine Bowie's original recording in popularity, with some, including Bowie himself, noting that many listeners don't know Bowie wrote it. Others have commended these covers as saving the song from obscurity.\n\nRetrospectively, Bowie's original recording has been named one of his best songs, with many praising the haunting and unsettling nature of the recording. Bowie performed the track live later in his career in different renditions than the original, including in a darker style during 1995's [[Outside Tour]]; a studio recording of the tour's arrangement appeared as a B-side in 1995. He again re-recorded the song in an acoustic arrangement in 1996 for the documentary ''ChangesNowBowie'', which was released in 2020 on the EP ''Is It Any Wonder?''. The original recording has since on multiple [[compilation album]]s and has been remastered multiple times, including in 2015 as part of the box set ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]''.\n\n==Composition and recording==\nThe backing track for \"The Man Who Sold the World\" was recorded at [[Trident Studios]] in London on 4 May 1970, along with other album track \"Running Gun Blues\". At this point, the track was recorded under the working title \"Saviour Machine\" and did not contain the title phrase.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=191\u2013192}} According to Kevin Cann, the lineup featured Bowie on acoustic guitar, [[Mick Ronson]] on electric guitar, producer [[Tony Visconti]] on bass, [[Woody Woodmansey]] on drums and percussion, and Ralph Mace on [[Moog synthesiser]]; Ronson and Woodmansey would later become famous as a part of [[the Spiders from Mars]].{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=210\u2013211}} According to Visconti, Bowie recorded his vocal on 22 May at [[Advision Studios]], the final day of mixing for the album which, when traveling to Advision, Bowie had intended to name ''Metrobolist'', an homage to [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=193}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=316}} Bowie's last-minute addition frustrated Visconti, who recalled in 1977: \"This was the beginning of [Bowie's] new style of writing \u2013 'I can't be bothered until I have to'. When it was finished, on the last day of the last mix, I remember telling David, 'I've had it, I can't work like this anymore \u2013 I'm through...David was very disappointed.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=193\u2013194}} This frustration was mostly due in part to his dissatisfaction with the recording sessions: he was mostly in charge of budget and production, as well as maintaining Bowie's interest in the project.

The term \"\u0dbb\u0dad\u0dd4 \u0dc5\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dd4\" ('red onion') in Sri Lanka refers to a variety of small red shallots, while large red onions are referred to as \"\u0db6\u0ddc\u0db8\u0dca\u0db6\u0dba\u0dd2 \u0dc5\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dd4\". That latter is used when either shallots are not available or a large quantity of onion is required.\n\n[[File:Woman chopping shallots.jpg|thumb|A person chopping shallots, for making [[satay]]]]\n\nIn most [[Indian cuisine]]s, the distinction between onions and shallots is weak; larger varieties of shallot are sometimes confused with small red onions and used interchangeably. Indeed, most parts of India use the regional name for onion interchangeably with shallot (Maharashtra, for instance, where both are called ''kanda''). The southern regions of India distinguish shallots from onions in recipes more often, especially the much loved tiny varieties (about the width of a finger); these are widely used in curries and different types of ''[[sambar (dish)|sambar]]'', a [[lentil]]-based dish. Shallots pickled in red vinegar are common in many Indian restaurants, served along with sauces and [[papadum|papad]] on the condiments tray. Indians also use it {{Clarify|fresh, fried, or pickled?|date=January 2012}} as a home remedy for sore throats, mixed with jaggery or sugar. In Nepal, shallots are used as one of the ingredients for making [[Momo (dumpling)|''momo'']]. In Kashmir shallots are widely used in preparation of Wazwan Kashmiri cuisine, as they add distinct flavor and prevent curry from becoming black, which is common with onions.\n\nIn [[Iranian cuisine|Iran]] shallots are used in various ways, the most common being grated shallot mixed into dense yogurt, a combination served in almost every restaurant when one orders grills or kebabs. Shallots are also used to make different types of ''torshi'' (\u062a\u0631\u0634\u06cc), a sour Iranian side dish consisting of a variety of vegetables under vinegar, eaten with main dishes in small quantities. Shallot is also pickled&mdash;called ''shour'' (\u0634\u0648\u0631) in Persian&mdash;along with other vegetables to be served as ''torshi''.\n\nIn [[Asian cuisine|Southeast Asian cuisines]], such as those of [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesia]], [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnam]], [[Thai cuisine|Thailand]], [[Cambodian cuisine|Cambodia]], [[Malaysian cuisine|Malaysia]], [[Philippine cuisine|Philippines]], [[Singapore cuisine|Singapore]] and [[Bruneian cuisine|Brunei]], both shallots and garlic are often used as elementary spices. Raw shallots can also accompany cucumbers when pickled in mild vinegar solution. They are also often chopped finely, then fried until golden brown, resulting in tiny crispy shallot chips called ''bawang goreng'' (fried onions) in Indonesian, which can be bought ready-made from groceries and supermarkets. Shallots enhance the flavor of many Southeast Asian dishes, such as [[fried rice]] variants. Crispy shallot chips are also used in southern Chinese cuisine.

The term \"\u0dbb\u0dad\u0dd4 \u0dc5\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dd4\" ('red onion') in Sri Lanka refers to a variety of small red shallots, while large red onions are referred to as \"\u0db6\u0ddc\u0db8\u0dca\u0db6\u0dba\u0dd2 \u0dc5\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dd4\". That latter is used when either shallots are not available or a large quantity of onion is required.\n\n[[File:Woman chopping shallots.jpg|thumb|A person chopping shallots, for making [[satay]]]]\n\nIn most [[Indian cuisine]]s, the distinction between onions and shallots is weak; larger varieties of shallot are sometimes confused with small red onions and used interchangeably. Indeed, most parts of India use the regional name for onion interchangeably with shallot (Maharashtra, for instance, where both are called ''kanda''). The southern regions of India distinguish shallots from onions in recipes more often, especially the much loved tiny varieties (about the width of a finger); these are widely used in curries and different types of ''[[sambar (dish)|sambar]]'', a [[lentil]]-based dish. Shallots pickled in red vinegar are common in many Indian restaurants, served along with sauces and [[papadum|papad]] on the condiments tray. Indians also use it {{Clarify|fresh, fried, or pickled?|date=January 2012}} as a home remedy for sore throats, mixed with jaggery or sugar. In Nepal, shallots are used as one of the ingredients for making [[Momo (dumpling)|''momo'']]. In Kashmir shallots are widely used in preparation of Wazwan Kashmiri cuisine, as they add distinct flavor and prevent curry from becoming black, which is common with onions.\n\nIn [[Iranian cuisine|Iran]] shallots are used in various ways, the most common being grated shallot mixed into dense yogurt, a combination served in almost every restaurant when one orders grills or kebabs. Shallots are also used to make different types of ''torshi'' (\u062a\u0631\u0634\u06cc), a sour Iranian side dish consisting of a variety of vegetables under vinegar, eaten with main dishes in small quantities. Shallot is also pickled&mdash;called ''shour'' (\u0634\u0648\u0631) in Persian&mdash;along with other vegetables to be served as ''torshi''.\n\nIn [[Asian cuisine|Southeast Asian cuisines]], such as those of [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesia]], [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnam]], [[Thai cuisine|Thailand]], [[Cambodian cuisine|Cambodia]], [[Malaysian cuisine|Malaysia]], [[Philippine cuisine|Philippines]], [[Singapore cuisine|Singapore]] and [[Bruneian cuisine|Brunei]], both shallots and garlic are often used as elementary spices. Raw shallots can also accompany cucumbers when pickled in mild vinegar solution. They are also often chopped finely, then fried until golden brown, resulting in tiny crispy shallot chips called ''bawang goreng'' (fried onions) in Indonesian, which can be bought ready-made from groceries and supermarkets. Shallots enhance the flavor of many Southeast Asian dishes, such as [[fried rice]] variants. Crispy shallot chips are also used in southern Chinese cuisine. In Indonesia, shallots are sometimes made into pickles that are added to several traditional foods; the pickles' sourness is thought to increase the appetite.\n\nThe tubular green leaves of the plant can also be eaten and are very similar to the leaves of spring onions and chives.\n\n===Dietary restrictions===\n{{main|Buddhist cuisine#Other restrictions|l1=Buddhist dietary restrictions}}\nMahayana monks do not consume shallots as they are considered to \"excite the senses\".\n\n<br />\n\n=== Non-Dietary Uses ===\nIn [[Sri Lanka]], A slice of a Shallot is applied to [[Tick]] bites as a first aid to prevent swelling.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Scallion]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Wiktionary-inline|shallot}}\n* {{Commons-inline|Allium ascalonicum}}\n* {{commonscat-inline|Shallot}}\n\n{{Allium}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q193498}}\n\n[[Category:Allium]]\n[[Category:Asian vegetables]]\n[[Category:Onions]]\n[[Category:Perennial vegetables]]\n[[Category:Root vegetables]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n[[Category:Miniature versions of vegetables]]\n", "name_user": "RoBro007", "label": "safe", "comment": "Header type", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallot"}

Her works have been shown at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]], and the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Chicago.\n\nShe began her studies at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], which also continued as she pursued her [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]] and [[Master of Fine Arts]] degrees. She has taught art at the college level.\n\nShe made [[Henri Matisse]]-inspired paintings of mothers and children in the 1960s. During that decade, she owned a gallery in Indianapolis. Her art changed markedly in the 1970s when she shifted to performance and other forms of art, as well as how women are depicted in art. Her studies of philosophy and psychology greatly influenced her art, both in terms of content and medium. Important works of the early 1970s are representations of goddesses, ''Some Living American Women Artists / Last Supper'', where the faces of the disciples are replaced with noted women artists, and ''Story Gathering Boxes''. She was a figure in the feminist art movement in Washington, D.C. and active in the [[civil rights movement]]. She worked to increase the rate at which works of art by women are among museum collections.\n\n==Personal life==\n===Early life and education===\nMary Beth Edelson was born Mary Elizabeth Johnson in [[East Chicago, Indiana]], in 1933.<ref name=\"Marter p. 136\" /> She was the eldest of three children born to Mary Lou and A.

Common themes in Edelson's work from this period include: ancient goddess figures, such as \"the enigmatic [[Baubo]], the trickster [[Sheela na gig|Sheela-na-gig]], an Egyptian bird goddess, and [[Minoan snake goddess figurines|Minoan snake goddesses]]\";<ref name=\":0\" /> references to popular culture; and subversions of art historical scenes.<ref name=\"Clara - Edelson\" /> [[Lucy R. Lippard|Lucy Lippard]] describes Edelson's approach to her artmaking: \"Mary Beth Edelson's work arises from Feminism\u2019s double strength. Like the great Goddess to whom she has dedicated her art, she has (at least) two aspects\u2014political rage and life-giving affirmation. The two merge in an individual identification with the collective ego: 'Women exploring who \"we are\" and not who \"I am\"'.\"<ref name=\"Lippard\" />\n\nEdelson joined the feminist cooperative gallery, [[A.I.R. Gallery]] (Artists In Residence), which held exhibits of Edelson's work, including ''The Memorial to the 9,000,000 Women Burned as Witches in the Christian Era''.

In March 2018 the entirety of Edelson's [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]] loft was digitally archived by The Feminist Institute (TFI), an online repository for feminist artwork overseen by [[Hunter College]].<ref name=\"Observer\" />\n\nMoMA PS1's 2015 survey show ''Greater New York'' included the artist's life-size monument to [[John and Lorena Bobbitt|Lorena Bobbitt]], who famously castrated her abusive husband in 1993. The sculpture, titled ''Kali Bobbitt'' (1994), reimagines Bobbitt as the warrior goddess [[Kali]], mounted on a [[ziggurat]] plinth, adorned with knives, and grasping a severed penis.<ref name=\"MoMA\" /> Edelson explains:\n\n{{quote|text=My interest in Bobbitt is obviously a feminist one\u2014I had a point of view about it immediately and wanted to examine and express that. I started thinking of her as Saint Bobbitt because she really did something for all women: She retaliated. In addition to the book, I\u2019ve also created a lot of other drawings and a sculpture of a Kali figure that I made out of a mannequin. She has a number of arms and a girdle of knives around her waist as well as a bracelet of severed penises around her arm. In short, she is decorated. I first exhibited the work at Combat Zone and put this very dramatic lighting on it. It sums up my feelings about the Bobbitt situation, a situation that I feel the same way about today as when I first heard about it\u2014I thought it was really funny. As someone once said: A hundred ten million women worldwide are survivors of [[Genital modification and mutilation|genital mutilation]], and then there is just [[John and Lorena Bobbitt|John Bobbitt]]\u2013\u2013one man, one name.|author=Mary Beth Edelson<ref name=\":0\" />}}\n\nIn March 2017 Edelson's 1973 hand-painted silver gelatin prints\u2013\u2013collectively titled ''Woman Rising\u2013\u2013''were exhibited in the show ''The Devil Giving Birth to the Patriarchy'' at David Lewis Gallery. This was the first exhibition to focus on the series, selections from which were later presented at Frieze London in a new section curated by [[Alison M. Gingeras|Alison Gingeras]] titled ''Sex Work: Feminist Art & Politics''.<ref name=\"Frieze\" /> The ''Woman Rising''\u2014of a woman \"standing staunchly, feet outspread, arms flung open to the sky, head thrust upwards. It is woman triumphant\" is a motif that appears throughout Edelson's work.<ref name=\"Flander\" />\n\n''The Devil Giving Birth to the Patriarchy'' (2017) also prominently featured Edelson's ''Kali Bobbitt'' sculpture, previously exhibited at MoMA PS1 in 2015.<ref name=\"Art in Am\" />\n\nIn October of the same year, the [[Tate Modern]] accessioned Edelson's ''Selected Wall Collages'' (1972\u20132011). The collages, made between 1972 and 2011, vary in size with the smallest measuring approximately 100 millimeters in height and the largest about one meter in height and width.

Her works have been shown at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]], and the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Chicago.\n\nShe began her studies at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], which also continued as she pursued her [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]] and [[Master of Fine Arts]] degrees. She has taught art at the college level.\n\nShe made [[Henri Matisse]]-inspired paintings of mothers and children in the 1960s. During that decade, she owned a gallery in Indianapolis. Her art changed markedly in the 1970s when she shifted to performance and other forms of art, as well as how women are depicted in art. Her studies of philosophy and psychology greatly influenced her art, both in terms of content and medium. Important works of the early 1970s are representations of goddesses, ''Some Living American Women Artists / Last Supper'', where the faces of the disciples are replaced with noted women artists, and ''Story Gathering Boxes''. She was a figure in the feminist art movement in Washington, D.C. and active in the [[civil rights movement]]. She worked to increase the rate at which works of art by women are among museum collections.\n\n==Personal life==\n===Early life and education===\nMary Beth Edelson was born Mary Elizabeth Johnson in [[East Chicago, Indiana]], in 1933.<ref name=\"Marter p. 136\" /> She was the eldest of three children born to Mary Lou and A.

Common themes in Edelson's work from this period include: ancient goddess figures, such as \"the enigmatic [[Baubo]], the trickster [[Sheela na gig|Sheela-na-gig]], an Egyptian bird goddess, and [[Minoan snake goddess figurines|Minoan snake goddesses]]\";<ref name=\":0\" /> references to popular culture; and subversions of art historical scenes.<ref name=\"Clara - Edelson\" /> [[Lucy R.

Like the great Goddess to whom she has dedicated her art, she has (at least) two aspects\u2014political rage and life-giving affirmation. The two merge in an individual identification with the collective ego: 'Women exploring who \"we are\" and not who \"I am\"'.\"<ref name=\"Lippard\" />\n\nEdelson joined the feminist cooperative gallery, [[A.I.R. Gallery]] (Artists In Residence), which held exhibits of Edelson's work, including ''The Memorial to the 9,000,000 Women Burned as Witches in the Christian Era''.

The sculpture, titled ''Kali Bobbitt'' (1994), reimagines Bobbitt as the warrior goddess [[Kali]], mounted on a [[ziggurat]] plinth, adorned with knives, and grasping a severed penis.<ref name=\"MoMA\" /> Edelson explains:\n\n{{quote|text=My interest in Bobbitt is obviously a feminist one\u2014I had a point of view about it immediately and wanted to examine and express that. I started thinking of her as Saint Bobbitt because she really did something for all women: She retaliated. In addition to the book, I\u2019ve also created a lot of other drawings and a sculpture of a Kali figure that I made out of a mannequin. She has a number of arms and a girdle of knives around her waist as well as a bracelet of severed penises around her arm. In short, she is decorated. I first exhibited the work at Combat Zone and put this very dramatic lighting on it. It sums up my feelings about the Bobbitt situation, a situation that I feel the same way about today as when I first heard about it\u2014I thought it was really funny.

He played for the [[Houston Astros]], [[Philadelphia Phillies]], and [[Washington Nationals]]. As a [[relief pitcher]] Lidge [[save (baseball)|saved]] 225 games during his career. He was a two-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]], and in 2008 won the [[Major League Baseball Delivery Man Award|Delivery Man of the Year Award]] and the [[National League]] (NL) [[Rolaids Relief Man Award]].

Lidge missed parts of his first four professional seasons (at Quad Cities, Kissimmee, Round Rock, and New Orleans) with injuries, including a torn rotator cuff and a broken forearm that threatened his career. He would overcome these injuries, making his debut in the major leagues on April 26, 2002, against the [[Atlanta Braves]], serving as a [[middle relief pitcher]] in the Astros' [[bullpen]]. He started the only game of his career in September of that year against the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. Lidge went 2-for-2 with a double and 2 [[run batted in|RBI]]s at the plate, but was pulled when he strained an intercostal muscle in his ribcage after pitching three scoreless innings with four strikeouts, two walks and a hit batsman.\n\n====2003\u201304====\nIn 2003, Lidge was the winning pitcher in the Astros' historic six-pitcher tandem which [[No-hitter|no-hit]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astrosdaily.com/history/20030611/|title=Big Days in Astros History - June 11, 2003 - Six Astros Pitchers No-Hit Yankees|website=www.astrosdaily.com}}</ref> the [[New York Yankees]] on June 11.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/gallery/featured/GAL1137746/6/26/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Most Recent No-Hitters, By Team | accessdate=2010-04-26 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221023043/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/gallery/featured/GAL1137746/6/26/index.htm | archivedate=2009-02-21 }}</ref> That year, Lidge was voted Astros Rookie of the Year by the Houston Chapter of the [[Baseball Writers' Association of America|BBWAA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/hou/news/hou_press_release.jsp?ymd=20031222&content_id=621942&vkey=pr_hou&fext=.jsp&c_id=hou|title=Hidalgo, Pettitte, Clemens to be honored at 19th annual Houston Baseball Dinner|website=Houston Astros}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the trades of [[Billy Wagner]] in the 2003 off-season and [[Octavio Dotel]] in the summer of 2004, the Astros moved Lidge from [[setup man]] to [[closer (baseball)|closer]]. He set a new [[National League]] record for [[strikeouts]] by a reliever with 157, passing [[Goose Gossage]]'s total of 151 set in 1977. The mark is third all-time for relievers, behind [[Dick Radatz]]'s 181 in {{Baseball year|1964}}, and [[Mark Eichhorn]]'s 166 in {{Baseball year|1986}}. In the 2004 season, hitters swung and missed at Lidge's strikes almost 42% of the time; for balls out of the strike zone, batters missed more than 70% of the time.

He threw 11 pitches (2 balls) to [[Melvin Mora]], [[Mike Sweeney]], and [[Garret Anderson]], who did not make contact with any of Lidge's pitches. Lidge became the first pitcher to strike out the side in his first All-Star appearance since [[Bill Caudill]] and [[Dwight Gooden]] in 1984.\n\nLater in 2005, Lidge finished the season with a 2.29 ERA and a career-high 42 saves. That year, Lidge ranked third in the National League in saves and became the second Houston Astros pitcher ever to record at least 40 saves in one season alongside Billy Wagner.\n\nDuring the [[2005 National League Championship Series|2005 NLCS]], Lidge gave up a 3-run home run to [[Albert Pujols]] in Game 5 in Houston which forced a Game 6 back in St. Louis, which the Astros would win to clinch their first World Series berth in franchise history. In his very next appearance, Lidge gave up a walk off home run to [[Scott Podsednik]] in Game 2 of the [[2005 World Series]] and the series winning run and hit in Game 4 to go 0-2 in the series and complete the White Sox sweep of the Astros.\n\n====2006\u201307====\nLidge pitched for the [[United States national baseball team]] in the [[2006 World Baseball Classic]], throwing two scoreless innings. Later that year, Lidge became the third pitcher in Astros history to record 100 saves with the club, after Wagner and [[Dave Smith (pitcher, born 1955)|Dave Smith]], and this led the Astros to sign Lidge to a one-year, $5.35 million contract that would keep him in Houston through the 2007 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/preview07/columns/story?columnist=crasnick_jerry&id=2809709|title=Crasnick: Baseball's obsession with the fastball|date=26 March 2007|website=ESPN.com}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Lidge was demoted from the closer's role on April 9, 2007.<ref>[http://mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070409&content_id=1888084&vkey=news_hou&fext=.jsp&c_id=hou Wheeler to replace Lidge as closer]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''MLB.com''</ref> Lidge would later regain his role in mid-June as the closer after going 10+ scoreless innings and posting a 2.45 era.

Lidge finished the season 5\u20133 with 19 saves in 27 chances for the Astros.

To exacerbate matters, this was the same knee that he had had surgery on during the off-season. Later in the month, he had successful [[arthroscopic surgery]] on his right knee to repair the torn [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]]. As a result, Lidge sat out until April 5 to start the season.\n\nDuring the early 2008 season, Lidge showed signs that he regained the dominant form he displayed in his earlier career. In the opening two months of the season, he converted 12 save opportunities and allowed just two earned runs. In May, Lidge returned to [[Minute Maid Park]], where he was greeted by a mixed reaction from Astros fans, but he recorded his 12th save of the season against his former team. He opened the month of June, usually the start of the summer's heavy-hitting season, with three saves earned in three straight games versus the [[Florida Marlins]] and the [[Cincinnati Reds]].\n\nIn July 2008, Lidge signed a 3-year contract extension with the Phillies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080706&content_id=3076058&vkey=news_phi&fext=.jsp&c_id=phi|title=After signing deal, Lidge looking to win|website=Philadelphia Phillies}}</ref> Lidge also set new Phillies records by converting his first 19 save opportunities and 35 straight saves.\n\nLidge was named to the roster of the [[2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]. He was announced before the game as the closer. After warming up six separate times, he ended up the final pitcher available in the game, and pitched in the 15th inning. He allowed a game-winning sacrifice fly in the bottom half of the inning, as the American League won the game, 4\u20133.  \n \nOn September 27, 2008, Lidge became the first closer in Phillies history to be perfect in regular season saves, converting 41 in as many opportunities, as he secured the [[National League East]] division title for the Phillies.  He is the first closer since [[\u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9]] in 2003 to have a perfect conversion rate and 30+ saves.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baer|first=Bill|title=100 Things Phillies Fans Should Know & Do Before They Die|date=2012|publisher=Triumph Books|location=United States|isbn=9781617496189|pages=256}}</ref> Lidge finished the 2008 season with 41 out of 41 save opportunities, a 1.95 ERA, and 92 strikeouts in 62 games.\n\nHe saved the decisive Game 5 of the [[2008 World Series]] in Philadelphia on October 29, 2008 over the [[Tampa Bay Rays]] with a strikeout, to make him 7 for 7 in postseason saves, thus completing his perfect season (a record he shares with [[John Wetteland]], [[Troy Percival]], [[Koji Uehara]], [[Zach Britton]] and [[Greg Holland (baseball)|Greg Holland]]; [[Robb Nen]] was also 7 for 7 in 2002 before he blew one on the 8th opportunity).\n\nLidge was eighth in the voting for the 2008 NL MVP award, behind [[Albert Pujols]], [[Ryan Howard]], [[Ryan Braun]], [[Manny Ramirez]], [[Lance Berkman]], [[CC Sabathia]], and [[David Wright]], and was the only player other than Pujols or Howard to receive first place votes.<ref>{{cite news | first=Matthew| last=Leach| coauthors= | title=Crowning achievement: Pujols NL MVP| date=2008-11-17| publisher=[[MLB.com]] | url =http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081117&content_id=3681885&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb| work = | pages = | accessdate = 2009-03-20 | language = }}</ref>\n\nHe received the [[MLB Comeback Player of the Year Award|MLB Comeback Player of the Year]] and [[DHL Delivery Man of the Year Award|''DHL'' Delivery Man of the Year]] awards.

He was a two-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]], and in 2008 won the [[Major League Baseball Delivery Man Award|Delivery Man of the Year Award]] and the [[National League]] (NL) [[Rolaids Relief Man Award]].

Lidge missed parts of his first four professional seasons (at Quad Cities, Kissimmee, Round Rock, and New Orleans) with injuries, including a torn rotator cuff and a broken forearm that threatened his career. He would overcome these injuries, making his debut in the major leagues on April 26, 2002 against the [[Atlanta Braves]], serving as a [[middle relief pitcher]] in the Astros' [[bullpen]]. He started the only game of his career in September of that year against the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. Lidge went 2-for-2 with a double and 2 [[run batted in|RBI]]s at the plate, but was pulled when he strained an intercostal muscle in his ribcage after pitching three scoreless innings with four strikeouts, two walks and a hit batsman.\n\n====2003\u201304====\nIn 2003, Lidge was the winning pitcher in the Astros' historic six-pitcher tandem which [[No-hitter|no-hit]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astrosdaily.com/history/20030611/|title=Big Days in Astros History - June 11, 2003 - Six Astros Pitchers No-Hit Yankees|website=www.astrosdaily.com}}</ref> the [[New York Yankees]] on June 11.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/gallery/featured/GAL1137746/6/26/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Most Recent No-Hitters, By Team | accessdate=2010-04-26 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221023043/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/gallery/featured/GAL1137746/6/26/index.htm | archivedate=2009-02-21 }}</ref> That year, Lidge was voted Astros Rookie of the Year by the Houston Chapter of the [[Baseball Writers' Association of America|BBWAA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/hou/news/hou_press_release.jsp?ymd=20031222&content_id=621942&vkey=pr_hou&fext=.jsp&c_id=hou|title=Hidalgo, Pettitte, Clemens to be honored at 19th annual Houston Baseball Dinner|website=Houston Astros}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the trades of [[Billy Wagner]] in the 2003 off-season and [[Octavio Dotel]] in the summer of 2004, the Astros moved Lidge from [[setup man]] to [[closer (baseball)|closer]].

The mark is third all-time for relievers, behind [[Dick Radatz]]'s 181 in {{Baseball year|1964}}, and [[Mark Eichhorn]]'s 166 in {{Baseball year|1986}}. In the 2004 season, hitters swung and missed at Lidge's strikes almost 42% of the time; for balls out of the strike zone, batters missed more than 70% of the time.

That year, Lidge ranked third in the National League in saves and became the second Houston Astros pitcher ever to record at least 40 saves in one season alongside Billy Wagner.\n\nDuring the [[2005 National League Championship Series|2005 NLCS]], Lidge gave up a 3-run home run to [[Albert Pujols]] in Game 5 in Houston which forced a Game 6 back in St. Louis, which the Astros would win to clinch their first World Series berth in franchise history. In his very next appearance, Lidge gave up a walk off home run to [[Scott Podsednik]] in Game 2 of the [[2005 World Series]] and the series winning run and hit in Game 4 to go 0-2 in the series and complete the White Sox sweep of the Astros.\n\n====2006\u201307====\nLidge pitched for the [[United States national baseball team]] in the [[2006 World Baseball Classic]], throwing two scoreless innings. Later that year, Lidge became the third pitcher in Astros history to record 100 saves with the club, after Wagner and [[Dave Smith (pitcher, born 1955)|Dave Smith]], and this led the Astros to sign Lidge to a one-year, $5.35 million contract that would keep him in Houston through the 2007 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/preview07/columns/story?columnist=crasnick_jerry&id=2809709|title=Crasnick: Baseball's obsession with the fastball|date=26 March 2007|website=ESPN.com}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Lidge was demoted from the closer's role on April 9, 2007.<ref>[http://mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070409&content_id=1888084&vkey=news_hou&fext=.jsp&c_id=hou Wheeler to replace Lidge as closer]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''MLB.com''</ref> Lidge would later regain his role in mid-June as the closer after going 10+ scoreless innings and posting a 2.45 era.

Lidge finished the season 5\u20133 with 19 saves in 27 chances for the Astros.

To exacerbate matters, this was the same knee that he had had surgery on during the off-season. Later in the month, he had successful [[arthroscopic surgery]] on his right knee to repair the torn [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]]. As a result, Lidge sat out until April 5 to start the season.\n\nDuring the early 2008 season, Lidge showed signs that he regained the dominant form he displayed in his earlier career. In the opening two months of the season, he converted 12 save opportunities and allowed just two earned runs. In May, Lidge returned to [[Minute Maid Park]], where he was greeted by a mixed reaction from Astros fans, but he recorded his 12th save of the season against his former team. He opened the month of June, usually the start of the summer's heavy-hitting season, with three saves earned in three straight games versus the [[Florida Marlins]] and the [[Cincinnati Reds]].\n\nIn July 2008, Lidge signed a 3-year contract extension with the Phillies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080706&content_id=3076058&vkey=news_phi&fext=.jsp&c_id=phi|title=After signing deal, Lidge looking to win|website=Philadelphia Phillies}}</ref> Lidge also set new Phillies records by converting his first 19 save opportunities and 35 straight saves.\n\nLidge was named to the roster of the [[2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]].

However, if convicted of multiple murders, either of the first or second-degree, the sentencing judge has the discretion to make parole ineligibility periods consecutive - thereby extending parole ineligibility beyond 25 years and, in rare cases, beyond a normal life-span.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/10/31/justin-bourque-gets-unprecedented-five-life-sentences-for-moncton-shootings/|title=Justin Bourque handed harshest sentence since Canada's last execution more than 50 years ago|first=Michael|last=MacDonald|date=31 October 2014|work=[[National Post]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/winnipeg-killing-machine-who-targeted-homeless-men-gets-three-life-sentences-no-parole|title=Winnipeg \u2018killing machine\u2019 who targeted homeless men gets three life sentences, no parole|author=|date=28 June 2016|website=nationalpost.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==China==\nIn [[China]], prisoners are often granted medical parole or [[compassionate release]], which releases them on the grounds that they must receive medical treatment which cannot be provided for in prison.

Mere good conduct while incarcerated in and of itself does not necessarily guarantee that an inmate will be paroled. Other factors may enter into the decision to grant or deny parole, most commonly the establishment of a permanent residence and immediate, gainful employment or some other clearly visible means of self-support upon release (such as [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] if the prisoner is old enough to qualify). Many states now permit sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole (such as for [[murder]] and [[espionage]]), and any prisoner not sentenced to either this or the [[death penalty]] will eventually have the [[right to petition]] for release (one state{{spaced ndash}}[[Alaska]]{{spaced ndash}}maintains neither the death penalty nor life imprisonment without parole as sentencing options).\n\nBefore being granted the privilege of parole, the inmate meets with members of the parole board and is interviewed,  The parolee also has a psychological exam. The inmate must first agree to abide by the conditions of parole set by the paroling authority. While in prison, the inmate signs a parole certificate or contract. On this contract are the conditions that the inmate must follow. These conditions usually require the parolee to meet regularly with his or her parole officer or community corrections agent, who assesses the behavior and adjustment of the parolee and determines whether the parolee is violating any of his or her terms of release (typically these include being at home during certain hours which is called a curfew, maintaining steady employment, not [[wikt:Appendix:Glossary of legal terms#Abscond|absconding]], refraining from illicit drug use and, sometimes, abstaining from [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]), attending drug or alcohol counseling, and having no contact with their victim.  The inmate gives an address which is verified by parole officers as valid before the inmate is released to parole supervision.\n\nUpon release, the parolee goes to a parole office and is assigned a parole officer.  Parole officers make unannounced visits to parolees' houses or apartments to check on them.  During these home visits officers look for signs of drug or alcohol use, guns or illegal weapons, and other illegal activities. Should parolees start to use drugs or alcohol, they are told to go to drug or alcohol counseling and [[Narcotics Anonymous]] or [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meetings. Should they not comply with conditions on the parole certificate (including [[Felony disenfranchisement in the United States|abstention from voting]]) a warrant is issued for their arrest.  Their parole time is stopped when the warrant is issued and starts only after they are arrested.  They have a [[Morrissey Hearing|parole violation hearing]] within a specified time, and then a decision is made by the parole board to revoke their parole or continue the parolee on parole. In some cases, a parolee may be discharged from parole before the time called for in the original sentence if it is determined that the parole restrictions are no longer necessary for the protection of society (this most frequently occurs when elderly parolees are involved).\n\nService members who commit crimes while in the [[US military|U.S. military]] may be subject to [[court martial]] proceedings under the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ). If found guilty, they may be sent to [[Federal prison|federal]] or [[military prisons]] and upon release may be supervised by U.S. [[Federal Probation]] officers.\n\nThe United States is the only nation in the world where parole is a politically divisive issue. According to the [[U.S. Department of Justice]], at least sixteen states have removed the option of parole entirely, and four more have abolished parole for certain violent offenders.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Quality of snitches declining as result of sentencing laws |date=17 August 1997 |newspaper=Arizona Republic |page=6}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Parole system in transition assailed as unfair |magazine=Newsday |date=2 May 2007 |url=http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny--parolequestioned0505may05,0,1199416.story |df=dmy}}{{Deadlink|date=June 2018}}</ref> During elections, politicians whose administrations parole any large number of prisoners (or, perhaps, one notorious criminal) are typically attacked by their opponents as being \"soft on crime\". The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) stated in 2005 that about 45% of parolees completed their sentences successfully, while 38% were returned to prison, and 11% absconded. These statistics, the DOJ says, are relatively unchanged since 1995; even so, some states (including [[New York (state)|New York]]) have abolished parole altogether for violent felons, and the federal government abolished it in 1984 for all offenders convicted of a federal crime, whether violent or not. Despite the decline in jurisdictions with a functioning parole system, the average annual growth of parolees was an increase of about 1.6% per year between 1995 and 2002.\n\nA variant of parole is known as \"[[time off for good behavior]]\", or, colloquially, \"good time\". Unlike the traditional form of parole{{spaced ndash}}which may be granted or denied at the discretion of a parole board{{spaced ndash}}time off for good behavior is automatic absent a certain number (or gravity) of infractions committed by a convict while incarcerated (in most jurisdictions the released inmate is placed under the supervision of a parole officer for a certain amount of time after being so released). In some cases \"good time\" can reduce the original sentence by as much as one-third. It is usually not made available to inmates serving life sentences, as there is no release date that can be moved up.\n\n===Difference between parole and mandatory supervision===\nSome states in the United States have what is known as \"mandatory supervision\", whereby an inmate is released before the completion of their sentence due to legal technicalities which oblige the offender justice system to free them. In the federal prison system,<ref>\"[http://famm.org/projects/federal/us-congress/good-time-credit-for-federal-prisoners/ \u201cGood Time Credit\u201d for Federal Prisoners] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614143028/http://famm.org/projects/federal/us-congress/good-time-credit-for-federal-prisoners/# |date=2017-06-14 }}.\" [[Families Against Mandatory Minimums]]. Retrieved on May 10, 2017.</ref> and in some states such as Texas, inmates are compensated with \"[[good conduct time|good time]]\", which is counted towards time served. For example, if an inmate served five years of a ten-year prison term, and also had five years of \"good time\", they will have completed their sentence \"on paper\", obliging the state to release them unless deemed a threat to society in writing by the parole board. Where parole is granted or denied at the discretion of a parole board, mandatory supervision does not involve a decision making process: one either qualifies for it or does not. Mandatory supervision tends to involve stipulations that are more lenient than those of parole, and in some cases place no obligations at all on the individual being released.\n\n===US immigration law===\n{{main article|Parole (United States immigration)}}\nIn US [[immigration law]], the term ''parole'' has two meanings related to allowing persons to enter or leave the United States without the normally required documentation.\n\n==Prisoners of war==\nParole is \"the agreement of persons who have been taken prisoner by an enemy that they will not again take up arms against those who captured them, either for a limited time or during the continuance of the war.\"<ref>2 Bouvier's Law Dictionary 2459 (1914)</ref> The [[US Department of Defense]] defines parole more broadly: \"Parole agreements are promises given the captor by a [[POW]] to fulfill stated conditions, such as not to bear arms or not to escape, in consideration of special privileges, such as release from captivity or lessened restraint.\"<ref>US Department of Defense Directive 1300.7, Training and Education Measures Necessary to Support the Code of Conduct (23 December 88).</ref>\n\nThe practice of paroling enemy troops began thousands of years ago, at least as early as the time of [[Carthage]].<ref>Herbert C.

Mere good conduct while incarcerated in and of itself does not necessarily guarantee that an inmate will be paroled. Other factors may enter into the decision to grant or deny parole, most commonly the establishment of a permanent residence and immediate, gainful employment or some other clearly visible means of self-support upon release (such as [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] if the prisoner is old enough to qualify). Many states now permit sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole (such as for [[murder]] and [[espionage]]), and any prisoner not sentenced to either this or the [[death penalty]] will eventually have the [[right to petition]] for release (one state{{spaced ndash}}[[Alaska]]{{spaced ndash}}maintains neither the death penalty nor life imprisonment without parole as sentencing options).\n\nBefore being granted the privilege of parole, the inmate meets with members of the parole board and is interviewed,  The parolee also has a psychological exam. The inmate must first agree to abide by the conditions of parole set by the paroling authority. While in prison, the inmate signs a parole certificate or contract. On this contract are the conditions that the inmate must follow. These conditions usually require the parolee to meet regularly with his or her parole officer or community corrections agent, who assesses the behavior and adjustment of the parolee and determines whether the parolee is violating any of his or her terms of release (typically these include being at home during certain hours which is called a curfew, maintaining steady employment, not [[wikt:Appendix:Glossary of legal terms#Abscond|absconding]], refraining from illicit drug use and, sometimes, abstaining from [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]), attending drug or alcohol counseling, and having no contact with their victim.  The inmate gives an address which is verified by parole officers as valid before the inmate is released to parole supervision.\n\nUpon release, the parolee goes to a parole office and is assigned a parole officer.  Parole officers make unannounced visits to parolees' houses or apartments to check on them.  During these home visits officers look for signs of drug or alcohol use, guns or illegal weapons, and other illegal activities. Should parolees start to use drugs or alcohol, they are told to go to drug or alcohol counseling and [[Narcotics Anonymous]] or [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meetings. Should they not comply with conditions on the parole certificate (including [[Felony disenfranchisement in the United States|abstention from voting]]) a warrant is issued for their arrest.  Their parole time is stopped when the warrant is issued and starts only after they are arrested.  They have a [[Morrissey Hearing|parole violation hearing]] within a specified time, and then a decision is made by the parole board to revoke their parole or continue the parolee on parole. In some cases, a parolee may be discharged from parole before the time called for in the original sentence if it is determined that the parole restrictions are no longer necessary for the protection of society (this most frequently occurs when elderly parolees are involved).\n\nService members who commit crimes while in the [[US military|U.S. military]] may be subject to [[court martial]] proceedings under the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ). If found guilty, they may be sent to [[Federal prison|federal]] or [[military prisons]] and upon release may be supervised by U.S. [[Federal Probation]] officers.\n\nThe United States is the only nation in the world where parole is a politically divisive issue. According to the [[U.S. Department of Justice]], at least sixteen states have removed the option of parole entirely, and four more have abolished parole for certain violent offenders.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Quality of snitches declining as result of sentencing laws |date=17 August 1997 |newspaper=Arizona Republic |page=6}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Parole system in transition assailed as unfair |magazine=Newsday |date=2 May 2007 |url=http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny--parolequestioned0505may05,0,1199416.story |df=dmy}}{{Deadlink|date=June 2018}}</ref> During elections, politicians whose administrations parole any large number of prisoners (or, perhaps, one notorious criminal) are typically attacked by their opponents as being \"soft on crime\". The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) stated in 2005 that about 45% of parolees completed their sentences successfully, while 38% were returned to prison, and 11% absconded. These statistics, the DOJ says, are relatively unchanged since 1995; even so, some states (including [[New York (state)|New York]]) have abolished parole altogether for violent felons, and the federal government abolished it in 1984 for all offenders convicted of a federal crime, whether violent or not. Despite the decline in jurisdictions with a functioning parole system, the average annual growth of parolees was an increase of about 1.6% per year between 1995 and 2002.\n\nA variant of parole is known as \"[[time off for good behavior]]\", or, colloquially, \"good time\". Unlike the traditional form of parole{{spaced ndash}}which may be granted or denied at the discretion of a parole board{{spaced ndash}}time off for good behavior is automatic absent a certain number (or gravity) of infractions committed by a convict while incarcerated (in most jurisdictions the released inmate is placed under the supervision of a parole officer for a certain amount of time after being so released). In some cases \"good time\" can reduce the original sentence by as much as one-third. It is usually not made available to inmates serving life sentences, as there is no release date that can be moved up.\n\n===Difference between parole and mandatory supervision===\nSome states in the United States have what is known as \"mandatory supervision\", whereby an inmate is released before the completion of their sentence due to legal technicalities which oblige the offender justice system to free them. In the federal prison system,<ref>\"[http://famm.org/projects/federal/us-congress/good-time-credit-for-federal-prisoners/ \u201cGood Time Credit\u201d for Federal Prisoners] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614143028/http://famm.org/projects/federal/us-congress/good-time-credit-for-federal-prisoners/# |date=2017-06-14 }}.\" [[Families Against Mandatory Minimums]]. Retrieved on May 10, 2017.</ref> and in some states such as Texas, inmates are compensated with \"[[good conduct time|good time]]\", which is counted towards time served. For example, if an inmate served five years of a ten-year prison term, and also had five years of \"good time\", they will have completed their sentence \"on paper\", obliging the state to release them unless deemed a threat to society in writing by the parole board. Where parole is granted or denied at the discretion of a parole board, mandatory supervision does not involve a decision making process: one either qualifies for it or does not. Mandatory supervision tends to involve stipulations that are more lenient than those of parole, and in some cases place no obligations at all on the individual being released.\n\n===US immigration law===\n{{main article|Parole (United States immigration)}}\nIn US [[immigration law]], the term ''parole'' has two meanings related to allowing persons to enter or leave the United States without the normally required documentation.\n\n==Prisoners of war==\nParole is \"the agreement of persons who have been taken prisoner by an enemy that they will not again take up arms against those who captured them, either for a limited time or during the continuance of the war.\"<ref>2 Bouvier's Law Dictionary 2459 (1914)</ref> The [[US Department of Defense]] defines parole more broadly: \"Parole agreements are promises given the captor by a [[POW]] to fulfill stated conditions, such as not to bear arms or not to escape, in consideration of special privileges, such as release from captivity or lessened restraint.\"<ref>US Department of Defense Directive 1300.7, Training and Education Measures Necessary to Support the Code of Conduct (23 December 88).</ref>\n\nThe practice of paroling enemy troops began thousands of years ago, at least as early as the time of [[Carthage]].<ref>Herbert C.
