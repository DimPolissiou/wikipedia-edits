in the [[2004 AFC Asian Cup Final]] when Chinese fans began to riot near the north gate of the [[Worker's Stadium]].<ref>ESPNSoccernet. [http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=306466&cc=5739 'Hand of Koji' brings Japan third title] 8 August 2004</ref> The rioting was said to be provoked by controversial officiating during the tournament and the heightened anti-Japanese sentiment at the time. China's most recent tournament meeting with Japan was at the [[2017 EAFF E-1 Football Championship]] where Japan won 2\u20131. China went on to finish as third-place in the tournament, while Japan finished 2nd.\n\nAnother rivalry with fellow neighbour [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] who China played 27 matches against between 1978 and 2010, without winning a single match. The media coined the term \"[[Konghanzheng|Koreaphobia]]\" to describe this phenomenon, but China finally registered its first win against South Korea on 10 February 2010, winning 3\u20130 during the [[2010 East Asian Football Championship]] and eventually going on to win the tournament.\n\n[[China\u2013Hong Kong football rivalry|A rivalry]] with [[Hong Kong national football team|Hong Kong]] has been created due to [[Hong Kong\u2013Mainland China conflict|political tension]] during [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2018 World Cup qualification]]. With Hong Kong fans booing the Chinese national anthem, which Team Hong Kong share with Team China, 2018 World cup qualifier matches were also very tense with both matches resulting in 0\u20130 draws. Prior to the rivalry buildup, Hong Kong was not considered as a worthy opponent due to lack of success comparing to China.\n\nChina also developed a smaller rivalry with [[Chinese Taipei national football team|Chinese Taipei]] due to the [[Chinese Civil War]] consequence. But with Chinese Taipei's football remains relatively weak, the team remains a lightly regarded opponent.\n===Head-to-head results===\n{{Main|China national football team results and

in the [[2004 AFC Asian Cup Final]] when Chinese fans began to riot near the north gate of the [[Worker's Stadium]].<ref>ESPNSoccernet. [http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=306466&cc=5739 'Hand of Koji' brings Japan third title] 8 August 2004</ref> The rioting was said to be provoked by controversial officiating during the tournament and the heightened anti-Japanese sentiment at the time. China's most recent tournament meeting with Japan was at the [[2017 EAFF E-1 Football Championship]] where Japan won 2\u20131. China went on to finish as third-place in the tournament, while Japan finished 2nd.\n\nAnother rivalry with fellow neighbour [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] who China played 27 matches against between 1978 and 2010, without winning a single match. The media coined the term \"[[Konghanzheng|Koreaphobia]]\" to describe this phenomenon, but China finally registered its first win against South Korea on 10 February 2010, winning 3\u20130 during the [[2010 East Asian Football Championship]] and eventually going on to win the tournament.\n\n[[China\u2013Hong Kong football rivalry|A rivalry]] with [[Hong Kong national football team|Hong Kong]] has been created due to [[Hong Kong\u2013Mainland China conflict|political tension]] during [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2018 World Cup qualification]]. With Hong Kong fans booing the Chinese national anthem, which Team Hong Kong share with Team China, 2018 World cup qualifier matches were also very tense with both matches resulting in 0\u20130 draws. Prior to the rivalry buildup, Hong Kong was not considered as a worthy opponent due to lack of success comparing to China.\n\nChina also developed a smaller rivalry with [[Chinese Taipei national football team|Chinese Taipei]] due to the [[Chinese Civil War]] consequence. But with Chinese Taipei's football remains relatively weak, the team remains a lightly regarded opponent.\n===Head-to-head results===\n{{Main|China national football team results and

The present club was founded in 1920 from a merger between Plymouth RFC (founded 1876) and Devonport Albion RFC (founded 1876). Since 2003 they have played their home games at [[The Brickfields]] stadium. Albion's traditional strip and club colours are white, strawberry (red or cherry) and green.\n\nAfter thirteen seasons in the [[English rugby union system|second tier]] of English rugby union, Plymouth Albion finish last in the [[2014\u201315 RFU Championship]], and currently play in [[National League 1]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Marsh|first1=Paddy|title=It's all over for Albion|work=Cornwall Independent|date=19 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plymouth RFC==\nFormed 1876, the club played at South Devon Place. In 1912, the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]] attempted to form a Western League of clubs in Devon and Cornwall. Huddersfield beat Oldham 31\u201326 in an exhibition game at South Devon Place in front of 8,000 spectators and as a result a meeting was held and the Plymouth Northern Union club was formed. In July, the Northern Union club took over South Devon Place and as a result Plymouth RFC disbanded, later to re-emerge as part of a merger with Devonport Albion to become Plymouth Albion.\n\n==Devonport Albion RFC==\nAlbion was formed in 1876 from apprentices at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport Dockyard]] and originally played at [[Devonport Park]]. After moving to Bladderly in 1887 they then moved to Home Park in 1893. The club stayed at Home Park for one season only, returning to Bladderley Lane in 1894, then, in 1896, Albion took a 14-year lease of Rectory grounds,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.DevonportOnline.co.uk/historic_devonport/sport/albion/albion.aspx|title='''www.DevonportOnline'''}}</ref> (the current home of [[Devonport Services R.F.C.]]).\n\n==Current club==\n[[File:The Brickfields.jpg|thumb|At match between Plymouth Albion and [[Cornish Pirates]] at The Brickfields in 2007]]\nDevonport Albion continued at the Rectory until it merged with Plymouth RFC to become Plymouth Albion and moved in 1920 to [[Beacon Park (Plymouth)|Beacon Park]]. In 2003, they moved from the run-down Beacon Park ground to a newly built ground, [[The Brickfields]], in [[Devonport, Devon|Devonport]]. The Brickfields also has an adjacent [[athletics stadium]].\n\nAlbion were a major force in English rugby union in the 1920s having five internationals on their books at one time. Around this time they attracted a crowd of 18,000 to a midweek game against [[Oxford University RFC|Oxford University]] which established a record crowd for a club match in England which was not exceeded until the 1980s.\n\nThey were promoted to [[National Division One]] in [[2001\u201302 National Division Two|2002]], and finished third in the [[2003\u201304 National Division One|2003\u201304 season]]. Observers say it was Plymouth Albion's best position nationally since the 1920s. On their way to promotion, the team went on a two-season unbeaten streak of over 50 games, starting when the club was in Division Three South and ending after their promotion to National Division One.\n\nThe major local rivals are [[Exeter Chiefs]] who also have an impressive new stadium at [[Sandy Park]] perched above the services junction of the M5. Devon local derbies have become major popular events. Together these clubs have reinvigorated the passion for rugby in the county.\n\nAlbion currently play in the [[National League 1]], the third tier of English club rugby. The club have financial problems and only avoided entering [[Administration (law)|administration]] early in 2015 following a cash injection of \u00a3250,000 by local businesses.<ref>{{cite news | title = Plymouth Albion: Troubled club avoids administration | publisher = [[BBC Sport]] | date = 2015-01-29 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-31043629 | accessdate = 2015-02-07}}</ref> Albion entered administration on 8 April 2016 and were deducted 30 pts by the [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Plymouth Albion taken over by David Venables and Bruce Priday|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/35998320|website=BBC Sports|accessdate=12 April 2016|date=8 April 2016}}</ref> Following administration they were taken over by former players, Bruce Priday and David Venables who put forward a business case to the RFU. Since then, Priday has moved to pastures new, whilst Max Venables is the Club's Managing Director.\n\nThe club also has a successful women's team and a new Under 18s Academy. They played their first game against a Cornwall XV in February 2019, finishing 50 - 7 victors.\n\n==Season summary==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! colspan=\"3\" | League\n! colspan=\"2\" | National Cup(s)\n! colspan=\"2\" | County Cup(s)\n|-\n!

Albion Rugby Football Club''' are a [[rugby union]] club who play in [[Plymouth]], England. The present club was founded in 1920 from a merger between Plymouth RFC (founded 1876) and Devonport Albion RFC (founded 1876). Since 2003 they have played their home games at [[The Brickfields]] stadium. Albion's traditional strip and club colours are white, strawberry (red or cherry) and green.\n\nAfter thirteen seasons in the [[English rugby union system|second tier]] of English rugby union, Plymouth Albion finish last in the [[2014\u201315 RFU Championship]], and currently play in [[National League 1]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Marsh|first1=Paddy|title=It's all over for Albion|work=Cornwall Independent|date=19 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plymouth RFC==\nFormed 1876, the club played at South Devon Place. In 1912, the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]] attempted to form a Western League of clubs in Devon and Cornwall. Huddersfield beat Oldham 31\u201326 in an exhibition game at South Devon Place in front of 8,000 spectators and as a result a meeting was held and the Plymouth Northern Union club was formed. In July, the Northern Union club took over South Devon Place and as a result Plymouth RFC disbanded, later to re-emerge as part of a merger with Devonport Albion to become Plymouth Albion.\n\n==Devonport Albion RFC==\nAlbion was formed in 1876 from apprentices at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport Dockyard]] and originally played at [[Devonport Park]]. After moving to Bladderly in 1887 they then moved to Home Park in 1893. The club stayed at Home Park for one season only, returning to Bladderley Lane in 1894, then, in 1896, Albion took a 14-year lease of Rectory grounds,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.DevonportOnline.co.uk/historic_devonport/sport/albion/albion.aspx|title='''www.DevonportOnline'''}}</ref> (the current home of [[Devonport Services R.F.C.]]).\n\n==Current club==\n[[File:The Brickfields.jpg|thumb|At match between Plymouth Albion and [[Cornish Pirates]] at The Brickfields in 2007]]\nDevonport Albion continued at the Rectory until it merged with Plymouth RFC to become Plymouth Albion and moved in 1920 to [[Beacon Park (Plymouth)|Beacon Park]]. In 2003, they moved from the run-down Beacon Park ground to a newly built ground, [[The Brickfields]], in [[Devonport, Devon|Devonport]]. The Brickfields also has an adjacent [[athletics stadium]].\n\nAlbion were a major force in English rugby union in the 1920s having five internationals on their books at one time. Around this time they attracted a crowd of 18,000 to a midweek game against [[Oxford University RFC|Oxford University]] which established a record crowd for a club match in England which was not exceeded until the 1980s.\n\nThey were promoted to [[National Division One]] in [[2001\u201302 National Division Two|2002]], and finished third in the [[2003\u201304 National Division One|2003\u201304 season]]. Observers say it was Plymouth Albion's best position nationally since the 1920s. On their way to promotion, the team went on a two-season unbeaten streak of over 50 games, starting when the club was in Division Three South and ending after their promotion to National Division One.\n\nThe major local rivals are [[Exeter Chiefs]] who also have an impressive new stadium at [[Sandy Park]] perched above the services junction of the M5. Devon local derbies have become major popular events. Together these clubs have reinvigorated the passion for rugby in the county.\n\nAlbion currently play in the [[National League 1]], the third tier of English club rugby. The club have financial problems and only avoided entering [[Administration (law)|administration]] early in 2015 following a cash injection of \u00a3250,000 by local businesses.<ref>{{cite news | title = Plymouth Albion: Troubled club avoids administration | publisher = [[BBC Sport]] | date = 2015-01-29 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-31043629 | accessdate = 2015-02-07}}</ref> Albion entered administration on 8 April 2016 and were deducted 30 pts by the [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Plymouth Albion taken over by David Venables and Bruce Priday|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/35998320|website=BBC Sports|accessdate=12 April 2016|date=8 April 2016}}</ref> Following administration they were taken over by former players, Bruce Priday and David Venables who put forward a business case to the RFU. Since then, Priday has moved to pastures new, whilst Max Venables is the Club's Managing Director.\n\nThe club also has a successful women's team and a new Under 18s Academy. They played their first game against a Cornwall XV in February 2019, finishing 50 - 7 victors.\n\n==Season summary==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! colspan=\"3\" | League\n! colspan=\"2\" | National Cup(s)\n! colspan=\"2\" | County Cup(s)\n|-\n!
