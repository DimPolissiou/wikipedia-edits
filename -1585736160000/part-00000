The school was founded in 1959 by Dr. [[Geoffrey William Griffin]], [[State Commendations of Kenya|MBS]], [[OBE]], Geoffrey Gatama Geturo and Joseph Kamiru Gikubu.<ref>Anthem of Bugles: The story of Starehe Boys Centre and School by Roger Martin</ref> It started as a rescue centre in Nairobi. Starehe and Brookhouse School are the only African schools south of the [[Sahara]] and north of the [[Limpopo]] distinguished as [[Round Square]] members.\n\n==Status==\nStarehe Boys' Centre and School educates at least 70% of its students free, and the rest at a reduced rate. This stems from its founding charter as a charitable school. School fees are paid on a means-tested basis, with substantial subsidies paid by the school, so that students from all walks of life are able to have a public school education that would otherwise be beyond their means.\n\nThe entrance process uses results from the national [[KCPE]] exams and prefers to award school places to those who show academic potential.\n\nThe school is governed by a Managing Committee chaired by Jimmy Mugerwa, Country Chairman of Kenya [[Shell and BP]], the school's main sponsors since its inception.\n\n===Admissions===\nAdmission of students is by open competitive examination. Each year about 20,000 applications are received; only 250 are selected to join the student body and about 6 places are left for very needy situations where the applicant might not have found a chance to apply but is still merited.\n\nCandidates are judged according to need and parental income and their performance in the national [[KCPE]] examinations. Selection is solely on merit.\n\n==History==\nStarehe Boys' Centre was the result of the vision of [[Geoffrey William Griffin]], assisted by [[Joseph Kamiru Gikubu|Joseph Gikubu]], and [[Geoffrey Gatama Geturo|Geoffrey Geturo]]. Its genesis was the earlier [[State of Emergency]] declared by the Governor of Colonial Kenya during the 1952 [[Mau Mau Uprising]] and the resultant overflow on to the streets of poor and destitute Mau Mau orphans.\n\nThe first 17 boys entered the school from [[Kariokor]] Rescue Centre, [[Nairobi]], and it was established in two tin huts donated by Kenya [[Shell and BP]] in 1959. After a few months it moved to its current location at [[Starehe]], Nairobi.\n\nThe name \"Starehe\" is Swahili for 'Tranquility', 'Peace', or 'Comfort', signifying a place where orphaned boys could find solace in its humble beginnings. It is also the name of the place in which the institution is situated.\n\nThe school is a member of the international [[Round Square (educational organisation)|Round Square]] school organisation, offering education to children from diverse backgrounds, many of whom are poor.\n\n==Traditions==\nThe [[school uniform]] is blue [[short trousers]] and red shirt, worn with a black tie and [[blazer]] or wind-breaker.\n\nLinks with the country and the community are maintained, with a monthly vacation spent in voluntary service to the community, either in hospitals, clinics, dispensaries or government offices, or any other institution that the students deem fit. This is referred to as the Voluntary Service Scheme, and is a way of giving back to society.\n\nStarehe hosts an annual football grudge match against [[Lenana School]] immediately before Founders' Day Dinner.\n\n==Accommodation==\nStudents take 'githeri' (mixture of beans and maize), a staple of the school since its inception. Starehe's education places emphasis on academic excellence as well as duty and discipline.<ref>Teaching Beyond Teaching: Dr. Geoffrey William Griffin and Starehe Boys Centre and School&nbsp;\u2013 by Peter Otiato Ojiambo</ref> An inscription at the Assembly Hall entrance reads \"the path of Duty is the way to Glory\".\n\nStudents perform daily duties that include cleaning their dormitories and the school compound as well as classes and laboratories. These duties are assigned and supervised by the prefects.\n\n==Discipline==\nStarehe follows a rank-based prefect system. A student may become a prefect from the second year at the school but never are full prefects. They only bear the rank of sub-prefect and are so confirmed during assembly where the Director announces their promotion. Promotion through the ranks is assessed by School Prefects (normally referred to as House Captains), who form the Cabinet of the School. Any potential prefect is vetted by the Cabinet, which consists of the School Prefects, the School Captains and the Director.\n\nCommoners are divided according to year. Those in Form One and Two are Junior Boys, Form Three and Four are Senior boys. Starehe also has a technical training institute called Starehe Technical Training Institute for post Secondary education. Starehe Institute students are referred to as \"collegers\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stareheboyscentre.ac.ke/sbc/school-info/admissions/admission-to-institute/|title=Institute \u2013 Starehe Boys Centre|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[School corporal punishment|corporal punishment]] was legal in Kenya, only the Director was allowed to use the [[caning|cane]] at Starehe.

Mosaics were used in a variety of private and public buildings.{{sfn|Bertoldi|2011}} They were highly influenced by earlier and contemporary [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]] [[Ancient Greek art|Greek]] mosaics, and often included famous figures from history and mythology, such as [[Alexander the Great]] in the [[Alexander Mosaic]].

Witts claims that [[Tessera|tessellated]] pavements, using [[tesserae]], were used in Europe from the late fifth to early fourth centuries BC.{{sfn|Witts|2005}} This is contradicted by Ruth Westgate, who contends that the earliest tessellated mosaics of the [[Hellenistic period]] date to the 3rd century BC, with the 2nd to early 1st-century BC [[mosaics of Delos]] constituting roughly half of the known examples.{{sfnp|Westgate|2000|pp=255-256}} Hetty Joyce and [[Katherine M. D. Dunbabin]] concur with this assessment, asserting that the transition from [[pebble]] mosaics to more complex tessellated mosaics originated in Hellenistic-[[Greek Sicily]] during the 3rd century BC, developed at sites such as [[Morgantina]] and [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].{{sfnp|Joyce|1979|p=260}}{{sfnp|Dunbabin|1979|p=265}} The earliest known pebble mosaics and use of [[Chipseal|chip pavement]] are found at [[Olynthus]] in Greece's [[Chalcidice]], dated to the 5th to 4th centuries BC, while other examples can be found at [[Pella]], capital of [[Macedon]], dated to the 4th century BC.{{sfnp|Joyce|1979|pp=259-260}}{{sfnp|Dunbabin|1979|p=265}}\n\nThe earliest mosaics of Roman [[Pompeii]], dated to the [[Pompeian Styles|Pompeian First Style]] of wall painting in the late 2nd and early 1st centuries BC, were clearly derived from the [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic Greek model]].{{sfnp|Westgate|2000|pp=255-275}} However, they contained far more figured scenes on average, less abstract design, the absence of [[lead]] strips, as well as an almost complete lack of complex, three-dimensional scenes utilizing [[polychromy]] until the [[Roman wall painting (200 BC\u2013AD 79)|Pompeian Second Style]] of wall painting (80-20 BC).{{sfnp|Joyce|1979|pp=253-254, 257-258}}{{sfnp|Westgate|2000|pp=255-275}} The mosaics in the [[Villa Romana del Casale]] (c. 300 AD) from [[Roman Sicily]] perhaps represent the hallmark of mosaic art in the [[Late antiquity|Late Imperial period]].

The design might also be pegged out in string,{{sfn|Witts|2005}} or mounted in a wooden frame.{{sfn|Oliver|2001}}\n\nThe collapse of buildings in antiquity can, paradoxically, both irrevocably destroy mosaics or protect and preserve them.{{sfn|Witts|2005}}\n\n==Imagery==\n[[File:05-Mosaico del Oecus.

The illusion that there were can be outgrown.\"</ref>\n*On the other hand, there is a connected debate concerning the extent to which any significant Germanic traditions apart from language, even smaller scale tribal traditions, survived ''after'' Roman times, when new political entities formed in Europe after the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. Some of these new entities are seen as precursors of European [[nation states]] that have survived into modern times, such as [[English people|England]] and [[French people|France]], and so such proposed connections back to medieval and classical barbarian nations were important to many of the [[Romanticism|Romanticist]] [[nationalist]] movements, which developed across Europe in modern times{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=13}} (The most notable of these has been \"[[Germanicism]]\", which saw [[Germans]] especially as direct heirs of a single Europe-conquering Germanic race and culture - a popular narrative which helped inspire [[Nazism]].<ref>See for example {{harvtxt|Wolfram|1988|p=10-13}}, {{harvtxt|Halsall|2014}}.</ref>) In contrast, more complex proposals about continuity today, such as those proposed by [[:de:Reinhard Wenskus|Reinhard Wenskus]], tend to focus on the possibility of more limited \"kernels\" of cultural traditions, which can be carried by relatively small groups with, or without, large-scale migrations.<ref>Examples: {{harvtxt|Heather|2009|pp=13-14,19-20}}; {{harvtxt|Halsall|2007|pp=14-15}}; {{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|pp=50-51}}</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century, genetic studies have begun to look more systematically at questions of ancestry, using both modern and ancient DNA.

[[Guy Halsall]] for example writes: \"The danger, barely addressed (at best dismissed as a purely \u2018ideological\u2019 objection), is of reducing ethnicity to biology and thus to something close to the nineteenth-century idea of race, at the basis of the \u2018nation state\u2019.\"{{sfn|Halsall|2014|p=518}}\n{{TOC limit|5}}\n\n==Definitions of Germanic peoples==\n{{Split section portions|date=March 2020|discuss=Talk:Germanic peoples#An article to define the scope of another article?}}\n===General===\nPossibly based on discussions with Gaulish allies during [[Gallic Wars|his campaign]] there, Julius Caesar published the first basic definition of what makes any people or peoples \"Germanic\", rather than for example Gaulish.{{sfn|Pohl|2004a|p=52-53}} This definition involved several criteria, allowing the possibility of debatable cases.<ref>{{harvtxt|Pohl|2006|p=100}}; {{harvtxt|M\u00fcller|1998|pp=8-10}}.</ref> Definitions of Germanic peoples continue to involve discussion of similar criteria:\n\n*Geography.

Already for Caesar, use of this definition requires knowing which people moved away from this homeland.\n*Language. Tacitus already referred to Suebian languages as a way of determining if a people was Germanic. Scholars defined a family of Germanic languages, which at least some of the ''Germani'' spoke, for example the Suevi. \n*[[Culture]], in the sense of clothing, economy, cults, laws and lifestyle of the different Germanic peoples was already used by Tacitus and Caesar to help distinguish the ''Germani'' from other northern peoples. In modern times, archaeologists study the surviving physical evidence left by the peoples of ''Germania'', and they have defined various regional cultures. Of these, there is consensus that at least the [[Jastorf culture]], between the Elbe and [[Oder]] rivers, was Germanic-speaking already in the time of Caesar. In parallel, other scholars have looked for textual fragmentary evidence concerning the laws, legends and cults of these peoples, and scholars such as [[Dennis Howard Green]] have sought leads in the Germanic languages themselves.{{sfn|Green|2007}}\n\nIn modern times, attempts to define characteristics which unite all or some of these peoples more objectively, using linguistic or archaeological criteria, have thus led to the possibility of the term \"Germanic\" being used to apply to more peoples, in other periods and regions.

Caesar, while describing his subsequent use of Roman soldiers deep in Gaulish territory, categorized the Cimbri, together with the peoples allied under Ariovistus, not as Gaulish, but as \"Germanic\", apparently using an ethnic term that was more local to the Rhine region where he fought Ariovistus. Modern scholars are undecided about whether the Cimbri were Germanic speakers like the Suebians, and even where exactly they lived in northern Europe, though it is likely to have been in or near [[Jutland]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Pohl|2006|p=11}}; {{harvtxt|Kaul|Martens|1995}}; {{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|p=282}}.</ref> Caesar thus proposed that these more distant peoples were the cause of invasions into Italy.

This \"''Germania magna''\", or Greater ''Germania'', was seen as a large wild country roughly east of the [[Rhine]], and north of the [[Danube]], but not everyone from within the area bounded by those rivers was ever described by Roman authors as Germanic, and not all ''Germani'' lived there.{{sfn|Liebeschuetz|2002|p=59-60}} The opening of Tacitus's ''Germania'' gave a rough definition only:\n<blockquote>Germania is separated from the Gauls, the [[Rhaetians]], and [[List_of_ancient_tribes_in_Illyria#Pannonian_tribes|Pannonii]], by the rivers Rhine and Danube.

In the north, greater ''Germania'' stretched all the way to the relatively unknown [[Arctic Ocean]]. In contrast, in the south of Greater ''Germania'' nearer the Danube, the Germanic peoples were seen by these Roman writers as immigrants or conquerors, living with other peoples whom they had come to dominate. More specifically, Tacitus noted various [[Suebi]]an Germanic-speaking peoples from the [[Elbe|Elbe river]] in the north, such as the [[Marcomanni]] and [[Quadi]], pushing into the [[Hercynian forest]] regions towards the Danube, where the Gaulish [[Volcae]], [[Helvetii]] and [[Boii]] had lived.<ref>Caesar, ''Gallic Wars'' 6.24; Tacitus, ''Germania''\n[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:28 28]; {{Harvtxt|Heather|2009|loc=p.6,p.53}}.</ref>\n\nRoman writers who added to Caesar's theoretical description, especially Tacitus, also at least partly defined the ''Germani'' by non-geographic criteria such as their economy, religion, clothing, and language.

Even the language from which it derives is a subject of dispute.{{efn|See for example {{harvtxt|Todd|2004|p=8-9}} and {{harvtxt|M\u00fcller|1998|p=80}}. The latter gives a detailed summary of some of the many proposals. {{harvtxt|Wolfram|1988|p=5}}, for example, thinks \"Germani\" must be Gaulish. Historian Wolfgang Pfeifer more or less concurs with Wolfram and surmises that the name Germani is likely of Celtic etymology, related in this case to the Old Irish word ''gair'' (neighbors) or could be tied to the Celtic word for their war cries ''gairm'', which simplifies into \"the neighbors\" or \"the screamers\".{{sfn|Pfeifer|2000|p=434}} But there is no consensus.}}\nWhatever it meant, the name probably applied originally only to a smaller group of people, the so-called \"''[[Germani cisrhenani]]''\", whose Latin scholarly name simply indicates that these were ''Germani'' living on the western side of the Rhine (see below).<ref>{{harvtxt|M\u00fcller|1998|p=4-5}}; {{harvtxt|Petrikovits|1999}}</ref> Tacitus reported that these Germanic peoples in Gaul, ancestors of the [[Tungri]] in his time, were the first people to be called ''Germani''.<ref name=tac2>Tacitus ''Germania'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:2 2]).</ref> According to Tacitus, their name had transferred to peoples such as those within the alliance of [[Ariovistus]], as a name having connotations that frightened potential enemies. While Caesar and Tacitus saw this Rhineland people as Germanic in the broader sense also, they do not fit easily with the much broader definitions of \"Germanic\" used by them or modern scholars. These original ''Germani'' are therefore a significant complication for all attempts to define the Germanic peoples according to which side of the Rhine they lived on, or according to their probable language.\n\n[[File:Two types of Germani.png|thumb|300px|The two main types of \"Germani\" in the time of Julius Caesar.

Neither Caesar nor Tacitus saw this as clashing with their broader definitions, because they believed these ''Germani'' had moved from east of the Rhine, where the other ''Germani'' lived. But this was not recent: Caesar reported that they were already on the west side during the [[Cimbrian War]] (113\u2013101 BCE), generations earlier.<ref>Caesar, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0448.phi001.perseus-eng1:2.4 2.4].</ref> The early ''Germani'' on both sides of the Lower Rhine were however distinguished from the Suebian ''Germani'' by Caesar, Tacitus, Pliny the Elder, and Strabo. Strabo even said that the ''Germani'' near the Rhine not only differed little from the Celts, but also that the Latin-speakers called them \"Germani\" because they were the \"genuine\" Gauls (which is a possible meaning of ''Germani'' in Latin).<ref name=strabo>Strabo, ''Geography'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-eng2:7.1.2 7.1.2].</ref> Pliny the Elder and Tacitus reported a tradition that the Lower Rhine ''Germani'' could be distinguished from the \"[[Ingaevones]]\" (who lived on the North Sea coast) as \"the [[Istaevones]]\", and the \"[[Herminones]]\" (who included the Suebian peoples) living inland of these groups (see below). Modern historical linguists and archaeologists have also come to doubt that these western ''Germani'' spoke a Germanic language as defined today, or shared the same [[material culture]], at least at the time of their first contact with Caesar and the Romans.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Roymans|2014|p=29}}: \"The archaeology of the Late Iron Age argues for a north-south articulation of the northwest European continent, in which the Rhine does not function as a cultural boundary.

As noted above, the Cimbri had previously been described as Celtic or [[Cimmerian]], and Greek writers continued to do so, while  Caesar described them as Germanic. Tacitus and Strabo both proposed with some uncertainty that the [[Bastarnae]], a large people known to the Graeco-Roman world before Caesar, from the region of what is now [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Ukrainian Galicia]] and [[Moldavia|Moldava]], might also have had mixed Germanic ancestry, and according to Tacitus, even a Germanic language. Pliny the Elder categorized them as a separate major division of the ''Germani'' like Istvaeones, Ingvaeones, and Irminones, but also separate from an eastern group which contained the [[Vandals]] and the [[Gutones]], both in what is now Poland.<ref>Strabo, ''Geography'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-eng2:7.3.17 7.3.17]; Tacitus, ''Germania'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:46 46]; Pliny, ''Natural History'',[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:4.28 4.28].</ref> (As already mentioned however, [[Livy]] said they spoke a language like the [[Scordisci]].<ref>Livy, ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri|History of Rome]]'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0914.phi00140.perseus-eng3:57 40.57].</ref>)\n\n===Later Roman \"Germanic peoples\"===\nThe theoretical descriptions of Germanic peoples by Tacitus, which have been very influential in modern times, may never have been commonly read or used in the Roman era.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=49}} It is clear in any case that in later Roman times the Rhine frontier (or ''[[Limes Germanicus]]''), the area where Caesar had first come in contact with Suevians and ''Germani cisrhenani'', was the normal \"Germanic\" area mentioned in writing. [[Walter Goffart]] has written that \"the one incontrovertible Germanic thing\" in the Roman era was \"the two Roman provinces of 'Germania,' on the middle and lower course of the Rhine river\" and: \"Whatever 'Germania' had meant to Tacitus, it had narrowed by the time of [[Jerome|St Jerome]] to an archaic or poetic term for the land normally called [[Austrasia|Francia]]\".<ref>{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|p=187}} and {{harvtxt|Goffart|1989|p=112-113}}.</ref> Edward James similarly wrote:\n<blockquote>It seems clear that in the fourth century 'German' was no longer a term which included all western barbarians. [...] [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], in the later fourth century, only uses ''Germania'' when he is referring to the Roman provinces of Upper Germany and Lower Germany; east of ''Germania'' are ''Alamannia'' and ''Francia''.{{sfn|James|2009|p=29}}</blockquote>\n\nAs an exceptional case, the poet [[Sidonius Apollinaris]], living in what is now southern France, described the [[Burgundians]] of his time as speaking a \"Germanic\" tongue and being \"''Germani''\". Wolfram has proposed that this word was chosen not because of a comparison of languages, but because the Burgundians had come from the Rhine region, and even argued that the use of this word by Sidonius might be seen as evidence against Burgundians being speakers of [[East Germanic]], given that the East Germanic speaking Goths, also present in southern France at this time, were never described this way.{{efn|{{Harvtxt|Wolfram|1997|p=259}} cites his letter 5, to his friend Syagrius. In contrast, the use of this word by Sidonius is apparently seen differently for example by {{Harvtxt|Liebeschuetz|2015|p=157}}, citing Sidonius Apollinaris, ''Carm.'' 12.4.}}\n\nFar from the Rhine, the Gothic peoples in what is today Ukraine, and the Anglo-Saxons in the British Isles, were only called Germanic in one surviving classical text, by [[Zosimus]] (5th century), but only in a case where he mistakenly believed he was writing about Rhineland peoples.{{sfn|Pohl|2004b|p=172}} Otherwise, Goths and similar peoples such as the Gepids, were consistently described as Scythian.\n\n===Medieval loss of the \"Germanic people\" concept===\nIn the Greek-speaking eastern Roman empire which continued to exist in the Middle ages, the Germanic concept was also lost or distorted. As explained by Walter Pohl, the late Roman equation of the Franks to the Germani led there to such non-classical contrasts as the French (West Franks) being ''Germani'' and the Germans (East Franks) being ''Alamanni'', or the [[Italo-Normans|Normans in Sicily]] being Franks, but the French being \"Franks and also ''Germani''\". In the [[Strategikon of Maurice|''Strategikon'' of Maurice]], written about 600, a contrast is made between three types of barbarian: Scythians, [[Slavs]], and \"blonde-haired\" peoples such as the Franks and Langobards - apparently having no convenient name to cover them together.{{sfn|Pohl|2004b|pp=171-172}}\n\nMedieval writers in western Europe used Caesar's old geographical concept of ''Germania'', which, like the new Frankish and clerical jurisdictions of their time, used the Rhine as a frontier marker, although they did not commonly refer to any contemporary ''Germani''. For example, [[Louis the German]] (''{{lang|la|Ludovicus Germanicus}}'') was named this way because he ruled east of the Rhine, and in contrast the kingdom west of the Rhine was still called ''Gallia'' (Gaul) in scholarly Latin.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=11}}\n\nWriters using Latin in [[West Germanic]]-speaking areas did recognize that those languages were related (Dutch, English, [[Lombardic language|Lombardic]], and German). To describe this they referred to \"Teutonic\" words and languages, seeing this as a Latin translation of ''[[Theodiscus]]'', which was a concept that West Germanic speakers used to refer to themselves. It is the source of the modern words \"[[wikt:Dutch|Dutch]]\", German \"[[wikt:Deutsch|Deutsch]]\", and Italian \"[[wikt:Tedesco|Tedesco]]\". [[Romance language]] speakers and others such as the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] were contrasted using words based on another old word, ''[[Walhaz]]'', the source of \"Welsh\", [[Wallach]], [[Welsch]], [[wikt:Walloon|Walloon]], etc., itself coming from the name of the [[Volcae]], a Celtic tribe.<ref name=\"Ringe 2009\">Ringe, Don. \"[http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1012 Inheritance versus lexical borrowing: a case with decisive sound-change evidence].\" ''Language Log,'' January 2009.</ref> Only a small number of writers were influenced by Tacitus, whose work was known at [[Fulda Abbey]], and few used terminology such as ''lingua Germanica'' instead of ''theudiscus sermo''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|loc= p.278 & 282}}; {{harvtxt|Goffart|1989|p=153}}.</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, there were several more origin myths written after Jordanes (see above) which similarly connected some of the post Roman peoples to a common origin in Scandinavia. As pointed out by Walter Pohl, Paul the Deacon even implied that the Goths, like the Lombards, ''descended from'' \"Germanic peoples\", though it is unclear if they continued to be \"Germanic\" after leaving the north.{{sfn|Pohl|2004b|p=174}} [[Freculf|Frechulf of Lisieux]], noted that some believed that the Goths might belong to the \"''nationes Theotistae''\", like the Franks, and that both the Franks and the Goths might have come from Scandinavia.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=46}} It is in this period, the 9th century [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian era]], that scholars are also first recorded speculating about relationships between Gothic and West Germanic languages. [[Smaragdus of Saint-Mihiel]] believed the Goths spoke a ''teodisca lingua'' like the Franks, and [[Walafrid Strabo]], calling it a ''theotiscus sermo'', was even aware of their Bible translation. However, though the similarities were noticed, Gothic would not have been intelligible to a West Germanic speaker.{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=409-413}}\n\nThe first detailed origins legend of the Anglo-Saxons was by [[Bede]] (died 735), and in his case he named the Angles and Saxons of Britain as tribes who once lived in ''Germania'', like, he says, the [[Frisians]], [[Rugians]], [[Danes]], [[Huns]], Old [[Saxons]] (''Antiqui Saxones'') and the [[Bructeri]]. He even says that British people still call them, corruptly, ''\"Garmani\"''. As with Jordanes and the Gutones, there is other evidence, linguistic and archaeological, which is consistent with his scholarly account, although this does not prove that Bede's non-scholarly contemporaries had accurate knowledge of historical details.<ref>{{harvtxt|Halsall|2007|p=198}}; Bede, ''History'', [https://archive.org/details/venerablebedesec00bede/page/246/mode/2up 5.9].</ref>\n\nIn western Europe then, there was a small scholarly awareness of the Tacitean \"Germanic peoples\", and even their potential connection to the Goths, but much more common were adherence to Caesar's concept of the geographical meaning of ''Germania'' east of the Rhine, and a perception of similarities between some Germanic languages - though they were not given this name until much later.\n\n\n==Later debates==\n===The influence of Jordanes and the ''Origo Gentes'' genre===\nThe ethnic military kingdoms which formed in the western Roman empire (see [[Germanic peoples#5th century. The western empire divided into kingdoms|below]]) each developed their own legends about their ethnic origins, the so-called ''[[Origo gentis]]'' stories. These often included an ancient connection to Romans or [[Troy|Trojans]], as apparently in the stories of the Franks, Burgundians and English, and they also typically mentioned the wild east of \"Scythia\". However, [[Jordanes]] (6th century), who wrote the most detailed surviving Gothic origins story, did effectively propose a connection to northern regions which much earlier authors had described as the remotest parts of ''Germania'', and established a tradition of connecting the earliest origins of Goths and other peoples to [[Scandza|Scandinavia]], which was for him a distant and almost unknown island. He thus connected the Goths (''Gothi'') not only with ancient Amazons, Trojans, Huns, and the similarly-named [[Getae]], but also to the Baltic sea. Some modern writers, such as Wolfram and Heather, still see this as confirmed by the mention of similar sounding \"Gutones\" near the south Baltic coast in earlier authors such as Tacitus and Ptolemy.{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=115}} Others have noted that Jordanes himself believed the Goths would have left the region centuries before those writers, making the identification doubtful. Indeed, he or his sources must have derived the many of the names of ancient peoples and places from reading old Latin and Greek authors.{{sfn|Christensen|2002}}\n\nVery influentially, Jordanes called Scandinavia a \"womb of nations\" (''vagina nationum''), asserting that many peoples came from there in prehistoric times. This idea influenced later origin legends including the Lombard origin story, written by [[Paul the Deacon]] (8th century) who opens his work with an explanation of this theory. During the Carolingian renaissance he and other scholars even sometimes used the Germanic terminology.{{sfn|Pohl|2004b|p=174}} (See [[Germanic peoples#Medieval loss of the \"Germanic people\" concept|below]].) The Scandinavian theme continued to be influential in medieval times and has even been influential in early modern speculations about Germanic peoples, for example in proposals about not only Goths and Gepids, but also [[Rugii|Rugian]] and Burgundian origins.\n\nThe continuing use of Jordanes and similar writers to attempt to prove that the Goths were \"Germanic\" in more than language continues to arouse debate among scholars, because while his work is unreliable, the Baltic connection on its own is consistent with linguistic and archaeological evidence.<ref>Concerning the archaeological evidence, for the Gothic peoples see {{Harvtxt|Heather|2009|p=120}}.</ref> However, Walter Goffart in particular has criticized the methodology of many modern scholars for using Jordanes and other origins stories as independent sources of real tribal memories, but only when it matches their beliefs arrived at in other ways.<ref>{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|page=46-47}}; {{Harvtxt|Goffart|1989|p=29}}.</ref>\n\n===Modern \"Germanic\" debates and \"Germanism\"===\n{{See|Pan-Germanism|Viking revival|Gothicism|}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 118-30, Hermanns-Denkmal, Jungdeutsche Tagung.jpg|thumbnail|300px|An event of the [[Young German Order]] at the \"[[Hermannsdenkmal]]\" monument to [[Arminius]], in 1925.

The artwork depicts Arminius saying farewell to his beloved wife before he goes off into battle.|330x330px]]\nDuring the [[Renaissance]] there was a rediscovery and renewed interest in secular writings of [[classical antiquity]]. By the late 15th century, [[Tacitus]] had become a focus of interest all around Europe, and, among other effects, this revolutionized ideas in Germany concerning the history of Germany itself. Tacitus continues to be an important influence in Germanic studies of antiquity, and is often read together with the ''[[Getica]]'' of [[Jordanes]]', who wrote much later.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|loc=43, pp.48ff}}\n<blockquote>Tacitus's ethnography won the attention it had formerly been denied because there now was a Germany, the \"German nation\" that had come into existence since the Carolingians, which Tacitus could now equip with a heaven-sent ancient dignity and pedigree.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=49}}</blockquote>\n\nIn this context, in the 19th century, the famous [[folklorist]] and linguist [[Jacob Grimm]] helped popularize the concept of Germanic languages as well as of [[Indo-european languages]]. Apart from the well-known [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]], collected with [[Wilhelm Grimm|his brother Wilhelm]], he published, for example, ''[[Deutsche Mythologie]]'' attempting to reconstruct [[Germanic mythology]], and a German dictionary ''[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]'' with detailed etymological proposals attempting to reconstruct the oldest Germanic language. He also popularized a new idea of these Germanic speakers, especially those in Germany, clinging valiantly to their supposed Germanic civilization over the centuries.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|p=48}} says: \"A whole library of nineteenth- and twentieth-century scholarship can be evoked to show that a \"Germanic antiquity\" existed in parallel to its Greco-Roman counterpart.\"}}\n\nThe subsequently popular modern assertion of strong cultural continuity between Roman-era ''Germani'' and medieval or modern Germanic speakers, especially Germans, assumed a strong connection between a family trees of language categories, and both cultural and racial heritages. The name of the newly defined language family, ''Germanic'', was long unpopular in other countries such as England, where the medieval \"Teutonic\" was seen as less potentially misleading.{{sfn|Chadwick|1945|p=143}} Similarly, in Denmark \"Gothic\" was sometimes used as a term for the language group uniting the ''Germani'' and the Goths, and a modified Gothonic was proposed by [[Gudmund Sch\u00fctte]] and used locally.{{sfn|Nielsen|2004}}\n\nThis [[Romanticism|romanticist]], [[nationalist]] approach has been rejected in its simplest forms since approximately [[World War II]]. For example, the once common habit of referring to Roman-era Germanic peoples as \"[[Germans]]\" is discouraged by modern historians, and modern [[Germans]] are no longer seen as the main successors of the ''Germani''.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|loc=Introduction}} Not only are ideas associated with [[Nazism]] now criticized, but also other romanticized ideas about the Germanic peoples. For example, Guy Halsall has mentioned the popularity of the \"view of the peoples of Germania as, essentially, proto-democratic communes of freemen\".{{sfn|Halsall|2014|p=516}} And [[Peter Heather]] has pointed out also that the [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory \"that some of Europe's barbarians were ultimately responsible for moving Europe onwards to the [[feudalism|feudal]] modern of production has also lost much of its force\".{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=614}}\n\nFurther, some historians now question whether there was any unifying Germanic culture even in Roman times, and secondly whether there was any significant continuity at all apart from language, connecting the Roman era Germanic peoples with the mixed new ethnic groups who formed in [[late antiquity]]. Skeptics of such connections include [[Walter Goffart]], and others associated with him and [[Toronto University]].{{sfn|Halsall|2014|p=18}} Goffart lists four \"contentions\" about how the Germanic terminology biases the conclusions of historians, and is therefore misleading:{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=7}}\n:1. Barbarian invasions should not be seen as a single collective movement. Different barbarian groups moved for their own reasons under their own leaders.\n:2. The pressures on the late Empire did not have a united source, and often came from within.\n:3. The classical Germanic peoples lacked any unity or center, and so they should not be seen as a civilization in the way Rome is.\n:4. We should not, according to Goffart, accept Jordanes as preserving an authentic oral tradition about a migration from Scandinavia.\n\nOn the other hand, the possibility of a small but significant \"core of tradition\" (''[[wikt:de:Traditionskern|Traditionskern]]'') surviving with the ruling classes of Roman Germanic peoples, in the societies of new medieval Germanic speaking peoples such as the [[Franks]], [[Alamanni]], [[Anglo-Saxons]], and [[Goths]], continues to be defended by other historians. This ''Traditionskern'' concept is associated for example with the [[Vienna School of History]], initiated by [[Reinhard Wenskus]], and later represented by scholars such as [[Herwig Wolfram]] and [[Walter Pohl]].\n\nPeter Heather for example, continues to use the Germanic terminology but writes that concerning proposals of Germanic continuity, \"all subsequent discussion has accepted and started from Wenskus's basic observations\" and \"the ''Germani'' in the first millenium were thus not closed groups with continuous histories\".{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=19}} Heather however believes that such caution now often goes too far in denying any large scale movements of people in specific cases, exemplified by [[Patrick Amory]]'s explanation of the [[Ostrogoths]] and their [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Kingdom]] of Italy.{{sfn|Heather|2007}}\n\nAnother proponent of relatively significant continuity, [[Wolf Liebeschuetz]], has argued that the shared use of Germanic languages by, for example, Anglo-Saxons and Goths, implies that they must have had more links to ''Germania'' than only language. While little concrete evidence has survived, Liebeschuetz proposes that the existence of [[Weregild]] laws, stipulating compensation payments to avoid blood feuds, must be Germanic because such laws were not Roman.{{sfn|Liebeschuetz|2015|pp=94-96}} Liebeschuetz also argues that recent sceptical scholars \"deprive the ancient Germans and their constituent tribes of any continuous identity\" and this is \"important\" because it makes European history a product of Roman history, not \"a joint creation of Roman and Germans\".{{sfn|Liebeschuetz|2015|p=90}}[[File:Nordic Bronze Age.png|thumb|upright=1|Map of the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] culture, around 1200 BCE]]\n\n==Prehistoric evidence==\n{{Further|Pre-Roman Iron Age}}\n[[File:Dejbjerg wagon, Nationalmuseet Copenhagen.jpg|thumb|upright=1|The Dejbjerg wagon, National Museum of Denmark]]\n\nCaesar, the original of the idea of the Germanic peoples, believed that in prehistory, before his time, the Rhine had divided these ''Germani'' from the Gauls. However, he noted that there must have already been significant movements in both directions, over the Rhine. Not only did he believe that the ''Germani'' have a long-standing tendency to make raids and group movements from the northeast, involving Germanic peoples such as the Cimbri long before him, and the Suevians in his time, it was also his understanding that there had been a time when the movement went in the opposite direction:\n<blockquote>And there was formerly a time when the Gauls excelled the Germans [''Germani''] in prowess, and waged war on them offensively, and, on account of the great number of their people and the insufficiency of their land, sent colonies over the Rhine . Accordingly, the [[Volcae]] [[Tectosages]], seized on those parts of Germany which are the most fruitful [and lie] around the Hercynian forest, (which, I perceive, was known by report to [[Eratosthenes]] and some other Greeks, and which they call Orcynia), and settled there.<ref>Caesar, ''Gallic Wars'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0448.phi001.perseus-eng1:6.24 6.24]</ref></blockquote>\n\nModern archaeologists disagree with this assessment and see no sign of such movements, seeing the Gaulish [[La T\u00e8ne culture]] as native to what is now southern Germany, and the La T\u00e8ne influenced cultures on both sides of the Lower Rhine in this period quite distinct from the Elbe Germanic peoples. On the other hand, the account of Caesar finds broad agreement with the archaeological record of the Celtic La T\u00e8ne culture first expanding to the north, influencing all cultures there, and then suddenly becoming scarce in the north. Subsequently the Jastorf culture expanded in all directions from the region between the lower Elbe and Oder rivers.\n=== Languages ===\n{{Main|Germanic languages|Proto-Germanic language|List of Germanic languages}}\nIt is believed that most of the early Germanic peoples spoke [[Germanic languages]].{{efn|{{harvtxt|Heather|2006|p=49|}} \"Germanic-speaking groups dominated most of central and northern Europe beyond Rome's riverine frontiers.

Moreover, it is often proposed, partly on the basis of descriptions by authors such as Caesar and Tacitus, that they shared traditions other than language, such as [[Germanic paganism|religion]], customs, costumes, weapons and [[Early Germanic law|law]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Pohl|2006|p=100}}; {{harvtxt|Liebeschuetz|2015|p=96}} (law).</ref>\n[[File:Solvognen - Do 2010 1276.jpg|thumb|upright=1|The gilded side of the [[Trundholm sun chariot]]]]\n\nThe ''[[urheimat]]'' (\"original homeland\" of the speakers of a [[proto-language]]) of the Germanic languages is thought to have been in the area of southern Scandinavia and northeastern Germany.

The Suevian peoples are seen by scholars as early [[West Germanic]] speakers. There is no consensus about whether neighbouring cultures in Scandinavia, Poland, and northwestern Germany were also part of a Germanic (or proto-Germanic)-speaking community at first, but this group of cultures were related to each other, and in contact. To the west of the Elbe for example, on what is now the German North Sea coast, was the so-called [[:de:Harpstedt-Nienburger Gruppe|Harpstedt-Nienburger Group]] between the Jastorf culture and the La T\u00e8ne influenced cultures of the Lower Rhine. To the east in what is now Poland was the [[Oksywie culture]], in the area where the later [[Wielbark culture]] developed, probably with the entry of [[East Germanic]] speakers. Related also to these and the Jastorf culture, was the [[Przeworsk culture]], which began as another La T\u00e8ne influenced local culture, and apparently became at least partly Germanic-speaking.\n\nThe Jastorf culture came into most direct contact with La T\u00e8ne cultures on the upper Elbe and Oder rivers, believed to correspond to the Celtic-speaking groups such as the Boii and Volcae described in this area by Roman sources. In the south of their range, the Jastorf and Przeworsk material cultures spread together, in the same direction.\n\n==Classical subdivisions==\n{{Further|Ing\u00e6vones|Herminones|Ist\u00e6vones}}\nBy the 1st century CE, the writings of [[Pliny the Elder]], and [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] reported a division of Germanic peoples into large groupings. Tacitus, in his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', specifically stated that one such division mentioned \"in old songs\" (''carminibus antiquis'') derived three such groups from three brothers, sons of [[Mannus]], who was son of an earth-born god, [[Tuisco|Tuisto]]. These terms are also sometimes used in older modern linguistic terminology, attempting to describe the divisions of later Germanic languages:\n*[[Ingvaeones]], nearest to the Ocean.\n*[[Herminones]] in the interior.\n*[[Istvaeones]], the remainder.<ref name=tac2/>\n\nOn the other hand, he wrote in the same passage that some believe that there are other groups which are just as old as these three, including \"the Marsi, Gambrivii, Suevi, Vandilii\". Of these, Tacitus only discussed the Suebi in detail, specifying that they were a very large grouping, with many tribes, with their own names. The largest, he said, was the [[Semnones]] near the Elbe, who \"claim that they are the oldest and the noblest of the Suebi.\"<ref name=tac2/>\n\n[[Pliny the Elder]], somewhat similarly, named five races of Germani in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia Naturalis]]'', with the same basic three groups as Tacitus, plus two more eastern blocks of Germans, the [[Vandals]], and further east the [[Bastarnae]]. He clarifies that the Istvaeones are near the Rhine, although he only gives one problematic example, the Cimbri. He also clarifies that the Suevi, though numerous, are actually in one of the three Mannus groups. His list:<ref> Plin. Nat. [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:4.28 4.28]</ref>\n*The [[Vandals|Vandili]], include the [[Burgundiones]], the [[Varini]], the [[Carini (Germanic tribe)|Carini]], and the [[Gutones]]. The Varini are listed by Tacitus as being Suebic, and the Gutones are described by him as Germanic, leaving open the question of whether they are Suebian.\n*The Ing\u00e6vones include the Cimbri, the Teutoni, and the tribes of the [[Chauci]].\n*The Ist\u00e6vones, who \"join up to the Rhine\", and including the Cimbri [sic, repeated, probably by error]\n*The Hermiones, forming a fourth, dwell in the interior, and include the Suevi, the [[Hermunduri]], the [[Chatti]], the [[Cherusci]],\n*The Peucini, who are also the [[Bastarnae|Bastern\u00e6]], adjoining the [[Dacians|Daci]].\n\nThese accounts and others from the period emphasize that the Suebi formed an especially large and powerful group. Tacitus speaks also of a geographical \"Suevia\" with two halves either side of the [[Sudetes]].<ref name=tac43/> The larger group that the Suevi were part of according to Pliny, the Hermiones, is mentioned in one other source: [[Pomponius Mela]] in his slightly earlier ''Description of the World,'' places \"the farthest people of [[Germania]], the Hermiones\" somewhere to the east of the Cimbri and the Teutones, apparently on the [[Baltic sea|Baltic]]. He did not mention Suebians.<ref>Pomponius Mela, ''Description of the World'', trans. F.E. Romer, 3.31\u20133.32</ref>\n\nStrabo, who focused mainly on ''Germani'' between the Elbe and Rhine, and does not mention the sons of Mannus, also set apart the names of ''Germani'' who are ''not'' Suevian, in two other groups, similarly implying three main divisions: \"smaller German tribes, as the Cherusci, Chatti, Gamabrivi, Chattuarii, and next the ocean the Sicambri, Chaubi, Bructeri, Cimbri, Cauci, Caulci, Campsiani\".<ref>Strabo, ''Geography'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-eng2:7.1.3 7.1.3]</ref>\n\nFrom the perspective of modern linguistic reconstructions, the classical ethnographers were not helpful in distinguishing two large groups that spoke types of Germanic very different from the Suebians and their neighbours, whose languages are the source of modern [[West Germanic]].\n*The Germanic peoples of the far north, in Scandinavia, were treated as Suebians by Tacitus, though their Germanic dialects would evolve into [[Proto Norse]], and later [[Old Norse]], as spoken by the [[Vikings]], and then the North Germanic language family of today.\n*The \"Gothic peoples\" who later formed large nations in the area that is today Ukraine, were not known to Tacitus, Pliny or Strabo, but their [[East Germanic]] languages are presumed to derive from languages spoken by Pliny's Vandal group (corresponding in part to the group made up of Gothones, Lemovii and Rugii described by Tacitus, who lived near the Baltic sea), and possibly also the Bastarnae.\nThe \"Gothic peoples\" in the territory of present-day Ukraine and Romania were seen by Graeco-Roman writers as culturally \"Scythian\", and not Germanic, and indeed some of them such as the Alans were clearly not Germanic-speaking either. Whether the Gothic-speaking groups among them had any consciousness of their connections to other Germanic-speaking peoples is a subject of dispute between scholars.\n\n==History==\n=== Earliest attestations ===\n\n==== Possible earliest contacts with the classical world (4th\u20133rd centuries BCE) ====\n{{Further|Pytheas|Bastarnae|Scirii}}\nBefore Julius Caesar, Romans and Greeks had very little contact with northern Europe itself.

As mentioned above, Caesar had this written up in a way which introduced the term \"Germanic\" to refer to peoples such as the Cimbri and Suebi.\n*63 BCE Ariovistus, described by Caesar as Germanic, led mixed forces over the Rhine into Gaul as an ally of the [[Sequani]] and [[Averni]] in their battle against the [[Aedui]], who they defeated at the [[Battle of Magetobriga]]. He stayed there on the west of the Rhine. He was also accepted as an ally by the Roman senate.\n*58 BCE. Caesar, as governor of Gaul, took the side of the [[Aedui]] against Ariovistus and his allies. He reported that Ariovistus had already settled 120,000 of his people, was demanding land for 24,000 [[Harudes]] who subsequently defeated the Aedui, and had 100 clans of Suebi coming into Gaul. Caesar defeated Ariovistus at the [[Battle of Vosges (58 BC)]].\n::Caesar listed people who fought for Ariovistus as the [[Harudes]], [[Marcomanni]], [[Tribocci]], [[Vangiones]], [[Nemetes]], [[Sedusii]], and \"Suevi\".<ref>Caesar, ''Gallic Wars'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0448.phi001.perseus-eng1:1.51 1.51]</ref>\n*55-53 BCE. Controversially, Caesar moved his attention to Northern Gaul. In 55 BCE he made a show of strength on the Lower Rhine, crossing it with a quickly made bridge, and then massacring a large migrating group of [[Tencteri]] and [[Usipetes]] who crossed the Rhine from the east. In the winter of 54/53 the [[Eburones]], the largest group of ''[[Germani cisrhenani]]'', revolted against the Romans and then dispersed into forests and swamps.\n::Caesar listed some ''Germani cisrhenani'' peoples: Eburones, [[Condrusi]], [[Caeraesi]], [[Paemani]] and [[Segni]]. He believed they were related to tribes on the east bank such as [[Sigambri]] and [[Ubii]]. He believed the Suevi were pressing such tribes over the Rhine from further east.\nStill in the 1st century BCE the term ''Germani'' was already used by Strabo (see above) and [[Cicero]] in ways clearly influenced by Caesar.<ref>Cicero, ''Against Piso'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi027.perseus-lat1:33 33].</ref> Of the tribes encountered by Caesar, the Tribocci, Vangiones, Nemetes and Ubii were all found later, on the east of the Rhine, along the new frontier of the Roman empire.\n\n====Julio-Claudian dynasty (27 BCE\u201468 CE) and the Year of Four Emperors (69 CE)====\n{{Further|Roman Iron Age|Early Imperial campaigns in Germania|Year of the Four Emperors}}\n[[File:Arminius pushkin.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Roman sculpture of a young man sometimes identified as [[Arminius]]]]\nDuring the reign of [[Augustus]] from 27 BCE until 14 CE, the Roman empire became established in Gaul, with the Rhine as a border. This empire made costly campaigns to pacify and control the large region between the Rhine and Elbe. In the reign of his successor [[Tiberius]] it became a policy to leave the border at the Rhine, and expand the empire no further in that direction. The [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]], the extended family of Augustus, played close personal attention to management of this Germanic frontier, establishing a tradition followed by many future emperors. Major campaigns were led from the Rhine personally by [[Nero Claudius Drusus]], step-son of Augustus, then by his brother the future emperor Tiberius; next by the son of Drusus, [[Germanicus]] (father of the future emperor [[Caligula]] and grandfather of [[Nero]]).\n\nIn 38 BCE, [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]], consul of Transalpine Gaul, became the second Roman to lead forces over the Rhine.<ref>Cassius Dio, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/48*.html#49 48.49].</ref> In 31 BCE [[Gaius Carrinas (consul 43 BC)|Gaius Carrinas]] repulsed an attack by Suebi from east of the Rhine.<ref>Cassius Dio, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/51*.html#21 51.21].</ref> In 25 BCE [[Marcus Vinicius (consul 19 BC)|Marcus Vinicius]] took vengeance on some ''Germani'' in ''Germania'', who had killed Roman traders.<ref>Cassius Dio, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/53*.html#26 53.26].</ref> In 17/16 BCE at the [[Battle of Bibracte]] the [[Sugambri]], [[Usipetes]], and [[Tencteri]] crossed the Rhine and defeated the 5th legion under [[Marcus Lollius]], capturing the legion's eagle.\n\nFrom 13 BCE until 17 CE there were major Roman campaigns across the Rhine nearly every year, often led by the family of Augustus. First came the pacification of the Usipetes, Sicambri, and [[Frisians]] near the Rhine, then attacks increased further from the Rhine, on the [[Chauci]], [[Cherusci]], [[Chatti]] and [[Suevi]] (including the [[Marcomanni]]). These campaigns eventually reached and even crossed the Elbe, and in 5 CE Tiberius was able to show strength by having a Roman fleet enter the Elbe and meet the legions in the heart of ''Germania''. However, within this period two Germanic kings formed large anti-Roman alliances. Both of them, ironically, had spent some of their youth in Rome:\n*After 9 BCE, [[Maroboduus]] of the Marcomanni, had led his people away from the Roman activities into the [[Bohemia|Bohemian]] area, defended by forests and mountains, and formed alliances with other peoples. He was referred to as a king of the Suevians.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annales'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi005.perseus-eng1:2.26 2.26].</ref> In 6 CE Rome planned an attack but forces were needed for the [[Bellum Batonianum|Illyrian revolt]] in the Balkans, until 9 CE, at which time another problem arose in the north...\n*In 9 CE, [[Arminius]] of the Cherusci, initially an ally of Rome, drew the a large unsuspecting Roman force into a trap in northern Germany, and defeated [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]] at the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]. Tiberius and Germanicus spent the next few years recovering their dominance of northern Germany. They made Maroboduus an ally, and he did not assist Arminius.\n*17-18 CE, war broke out between Arminius and Maroboduus, with indecisive results.\n*19 CE, Marobduus was deposed by a rival claimant, perhaps supported by the Romans, and fled to Italy. He died in 37 CE. Germanicus also died, in [[Antioch]].\n*21 CE. Arminius died, murdered by opponents within his own tribe.\n\nStrabo, writing in this period in Greek, mentioned that apart from the area near the Rhine itself, the areas to the east were now inhabited by the Suevi, \"who are also named Germans, but are superior both in power and number to the others, whom they drove out, and who have now taken refuge on this side the Rhine\". Various peoples had fallen \"prey to the flames of war\".<ref>Strabo, ''Geography'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-eng2:4.3.4 4.3.4].</ref>\n\nThe Julio-Claudian dynasty also recruited northern Germanic warriors, particularly men of the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]], as personal bodyguards to the Roman emperor, forming the so-called [[Numerus Batavorum]].

However, the ability to handle the barbarians in the old way broke down in the late 4th century and the western part of the empire itself broke down. In addition to the Franks on the Rhine frontier, and Suevian peoples such as the Alamanni, the eastern Germanic-speaking \"Gothic peoples\" now played an increasing role both inside and outside imperial territory.\n====Gothic entry into the empire====\n{{Main|Gothic War (376\u2013382)}}\nThe Gothic wars of the late 4th century, were in some ways similar to the biggest border conflicts of the past, but saw the defeat of a major Roman army and killing of emperor [[Valens]] at the [[Battle of Adrianopolis]] (378). While the eastern empire eventually recovered, the subsequent long reigning western emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] (reigned 393-423) was unable to impose imperial authority over much of the empire, for most of his reign.<ref>{{harvtxt|Halsall|2007|pp=234-237}}</ref> In contrast to the eastern empire, in the west the \"attempts of its ruling class to use the Roman-barbarian kings to preserve the [[res publica]] failed\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=103}}\n\nThe Gothic wars were affected indirectly by the arrival of the nomadic [[Huns]] from Central Asia into the Ukrainian region. Some Gothic peoples, such as the [[Gepids]] and the [[Greuthungi]] (sometimes seen as predecessors of the later [[Ostrogoths]]), joined the newly forming Hunnish faction, and played a prominent role in the Hunnic Empire, where Gothic became a [[lingua franca]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=142}} Based on the description of [[Socrates Scholasticus]], Guy Halsall has argued that the Hunnish hegemony developed after a major campaign by Valens against the Goths, which had caused great damage, but failed to achieve a decisive victory.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=173}} Peter Heather has argued that Socrates should be rejected on this point, as inconsistent with the testimony of [[Ammianus]].{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=160}}\n\nIn contrast, the Gothic [[Thervingi]] had borne the impact of the campaign of Valens, under the leadership of [[Athanaric]], and were losers against the Huns, but clients of Rome. A new faction under leadership of [[Fritigern]], a christian, were given asylum inside the Roman Empire in 376 CE. They crossed the Danube and became ''[[foederati]]''.{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=594}} With the emperor occupied in the Middle East, the Tervingi were treated badly, becoming desperate, and significant numbers of mounted Greuthungi, [[Alans]] and others were able to cross the river and support a Tervingian uprising leading to the massive Roman defeat at Adrianople.<ref>{{harvtxt|Halsall|2007|pp=176-178}}; {{harvtxt|Wolfram|1997|pp=79-87}}.</ref>\n\nAround 383, the Romans and the Goths now within the empire came to agreements about the terms under which the Goths should live. There is debate about the exact nature of such agreements, and for example whether it allowed the continuous semi-independent existence of pre-existing peoples, however the Goths do appear to have been allowed more privileges than traditional settlements with such outside groups.<ref>Contrast {{harvtxt|Halsall|2007|pp=180-185}} and {{harvtxt|Heather|2009|pp=189-196}}.</ref> One result of the large settlement was that the imperial army now had a large number of Goths, including Gothic generals.<ref>{{harvtxt|Halsall|2007|pp=183-185}}; {{harvtxt|Heather|2009|p=194}}; {{harvtxt|Wolfram|1997|p=110}}.</ref>\n\n====Imperial turmoil====\nBy 383 a new emperor, [[Theodosius I]], was seen as victorious over the Goths and having the situation back under control. Goths were a prominent but resented part of the eastern military. The Greutungi and Alans had been settled in [[Pannonia]] by the western co-emperor [[Gratian]] (assassinated in 383) who was himself a Pannonian. Theodosius died 395, and was succeeded by his sons: [[Arcadius]] in the east, and Honorius, who was still a minor, in the west. The Western empire had however become destabilized since 383, with several young emperors including Gratian having previously been murdered. Court factions and military leaders in the east and west attempted to control the situation.\n\n[[Alaric I|Alaric]] was a Roman military commander of Gothic background, who first appears in the record in the time of Theodosius. He became one of the various Roman competitors for influence and power in the difficult situation. The forces he led were described as mixed barbarian forces, and clearly included many other people of Gothic background, which had become common in the eastern empire. In an important turning point for Roman history, during the factional turmoil, his army came to act increasingly as an independent political entity within the Roman empire, and he eventually came to be referred to as their king, probably around 401 CE, when he lost his official Roman title.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=206,217}} This is the origin of the [[Visigoths]], who the empire later allowed to settle in what is now southwestern France. While military units had often had their own ethnic history and symbolism, this is the first time that such a group became a new kingdom. There is disagreement about whether Alaric or his family had a royal background, but there is no doubt that this kingdom was a new entity, very different from any previous Gothic kingdoms.\n\n====Invasions of 401\u2013411====\n{{Main|Crossing of the Rhine|Radagaisus}}\nIn the aftermath of the large scale Gothic entries into the empire, the Germanic Rhine groups, the Franks and Alemanni, became more secure in their positions in 395, when [[Stilicho]] made agreements with them so that he could withdraw the imperial forces from their Rhine frontier in order to use them in his conflicts with Alaric and the Eastern empire.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=199}}\n\nOn the Danube, change was far more dramatic. In the words of Walter Goffart:\n:Between 401 and 411, four distinct groups of barbarians - different from Alaric's Goths - invaded Roman territory, all apparently on one-way journeys, in large-scale efforts to transpose themselves onto imperial soil and not just plunder and return home.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=94}}\n\nThe reasons that these invasions apparently all dispersed from the same area, the Middle Danube, are uncertain. It is most often argued that the Huns must have already started moving west, and pressuring the Middle Danube. Peter Heather for example writes that around 400, \"a highly explosive situation was building up in the Middle Danube, as Goths, Vandals, Alans and other refugees from the Huns moved west of the Carpathians\" into the area of modern Hungary on the Roman frontier.{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=182-183,197}}\n\nWalter Goffart, in contrast, has pointed out that there is no clear evidence of new eastern groups arriving in the area immediately before the great movements, and so it remains possible that the Huns moved West after these large groups had left the Middle Danube. Goffart's suggestion is that the example of the Goths, such as those led by Alaric, had set an example leading to a \"common perception that warriors could improve their condition by forcing their existence on the attention of the Empire\".{{sfn|Goffart|2006|loc=ch.5}}\n\nWhatever the chain of events, the Middle Danube later became the centre of Attila's loose empire containing many East Germanic people from the east, who remained there after the death of Attila. The make-up of peoples in that area, previously the home of the Germanic Marcomanni, Quadi and non-Germanic Iazyges, changed completely in ways which had a significant impact on the Roman empire and its European neighbours. In the future, though the new peoples ruling this area still included Germanic-speakers, as discussed above, they were not described by Romans as ''Germani'', but rather \"Gothic peoples\".\n\n*In 401, [[Claudian]] mentions a Roman victory over a large force including Vandals, in the province of Ra\u00ebtia. It is possible that this group was involved in the later crossing of the Rhine.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|pp=88-89}}\n*In 405-406, [[Radagaisus]] who was probably Gothic, entered the empire on the Middle Danube with a very large force of unclearly defined, but apparently Gothic, composition, and succeeded to invade Italy.{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=182}} He was captured and killed in 406 near Florence and 12000 of his men recruited into Roman forces.\n*A more successful invasion apparently also originating from the Middle Danube, reached the Rhine a few months later. As described by Halsall: \"On 31 December 405 a huge body from the interior of Germania crossed the Rhine: Siling and Hasding Vandals, Sueves and Alans. [...] The Franks in the area fought back furiously and even killed the Vandal king. Significantly no source mentions any defense by Roman troops.\"{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=211}} The composition of this group of barbarians, who were not all Germanic-speaking, indicates that they had traveled from the area north of the [[Middle Danube]]. (The Suebians involved may well have included remnants of the once powerful Marcomanni and Quadi.) The non-Germanic Alans were the largest group, and one part of them under [[King Goar]] settled with Roman agreement in Gaul, while the rest of these peoples entered Roman Iberia in 409 and established kingdoms there, and some traveled further to establish the Vandal kingdom of North Africa.\n*In 411 a Burgundian group established themselves in northern [[Germania Superior]] on the Rhine, between Franks and Alamanni, holding the cities of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Speyer]], and [[Strassburg]]. They and a group of Alans helped establish yet another short-lived claimant to the throne, [[Jovinus]], who was eventually defeated by the Visigoths cooperating with Honorius.\n\nMotivated by the ensuing chaos in Gaul, in 406 the Roman army in Britain elected [[Constantine III (Western Roman Emperor)|Constantine \"III\"]] as emperor and they took control there.\n\nIn 408, the eastern emperor Arcadius died, leaving a child as successor, and the west Roman military leader [[Stilicho]] was killed. Alaric, wanting a formal Roman command but unable to negotiate one, invaded Rome itself, twice, in 401 and 408.\n\n[[Constantius III]], who became ''[[Magister militum]]'' by 411, restored order step-by-step, eventually allowing the Visigoths to settle within the empire in southwest Gaul. He also committed to re-taking control of Iberia, from the Rhine-crossing groups. When Constantius died in 421, having been co-emperor himself for one year, Honorius was the only emperor in the West. However, Honorius died in 423 without heir. After this, the Western Roman empire steadily lost control of its provinces.\n\n==== From Western Roman Empire to medieval kingdoms (420\u2013568) ====\n{{Further|Decline of the Western Roman Empire|Barbarian kingdoms}}\n[[File:Europe and the Near East at 476 AD.png|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Germania|Germanic]] kingdoms and tribes after the end of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in 476 CE]]\n[[File:Odovacar Ravenna 477.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Coin of [[Odoacer]], Ravenna, 477, with Odoacer in profile, depicted with a \"barbarian\" [[moustache]].]]\n[[File:Germanic kingdoms 526CE.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Germanic kingdoms in 526 CE]]\n[[File:Invasions of the Roman Empire 1.png|thumb|upright=1.5|2nd century to 6th century simplified migrations]]\nThe Western Roman Empire declined over several steps in the 5th and 6th centuries, and the eastern emperors only had limited control over events in Italy and the western empire. Germanic speakers who by now dominated the Roman military in Europe, and lived both inside and outside the empire, played many roles in this complex dynamic. Notably, as the old territory of the western empire came to be ruled on a regional basis, the barbarian military forces, ruled now by kings, took over administration with differing levels of success. With some exceptions, such as the [[Alans]] and [[Bretons]], most of these new political entities identified themselves with a Germanic-speaking heritage.\n\nIn the 420s, [[Flavius A\u00ebtius]] was a general who successfully used Hunnish forces on several occasions, fighting Roman factions, and various barbarians including Goths and Franks. In 429 he was elevated to the rank of ''magister militum'' in the western empire, putting him in control of much of its policy. One of his first conflicts was with [[Bonifacius|Boniface]], a rebellious governor of the province of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]] in modern Tunisia and Libya. Both sides sought an alliance with the Vandals based in southern Spain who had acquired a fleet there. In this context, the [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandal and Alan kingdom]] of North Africa and the western Mediterranean would come into being.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=240}}\n*In 433 A\u00ebtius was in exile and spent time in the Hunnish domain.\n*In 434, the Vandals were granted the control of some parts of northwest Africa, but A\u00ebtius defeated Boniface using Hunnish forces.\n*In 436 A\u00ebtius defeated the Burgundians on the Rhine with the help of Hunnish forces.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=244}}\n*In 439 the Vandals and their allies captured Carthage. The Romans made a new agreement recognizing the Visigothic kingdom.\n*In 440, the Hunnish \"empire\" as it can now be called, under [[Attila]] and his brother Bleda began a series of attacks over the Danube into the eastern empire, and Danubian part of the western empire. They received enormous payments from the eastern empire and then focused their attentions to the west, where they were already familiar with the situation, and in friendly contact with the African Vandals.\n*In 442 A\u00ebtius seems to have granted the Alans who had remained in Gaul a kingdom, apparently including [[Orl\u00e9ans]], possibly to counter local independent Roman groups (so called [[Bagaudae]], who also competed for power in Iberia).\n*In 443 A\u00ebtius settled the Burgundians from the Rhine deeper in the empire, in Savoy in Gaul.\n*In 451, the large mixed force of Attila crossed the Rhine but was defeated by Aetius with forces from the settled barbarians in Gaul - Visigoths, Franks, Burgundians and Alans.\n*In 452 Attila attacked Italy, but had to retreat to the Middle Danube because of disease.\n*In 453, A\u00ebtius and Attila both died.\n*In 454, the Hunnish alliance divided and fought the [[Battle of Nedao]]. The original names of the peoples in the alliance appear again. Several of them were allowed to become federates of the eastern empire in the Balkans, and others created kingdoms in the Middle Danube.\n\nIn the subsequent decades, the Franks and Alamanni tended to remain in small kingdoms but these began to extend deeper into the empire. In northern Gaul, a Roman military \"King of Franks\" also seems to have existed, [[Childeric I]], whose successor [[Clovis I]] established dominance of the smaller kingdoms of the Franks and Alamanni, who they defeated at the [[Battle of Tolbiac|Battle of Z\u00fclpich]] in 496. \n\nCompared to Gaul, what happened in [[Roman Britain]], which was similarly both isolated from Italy and heavily Romanized, is less clearly recorded. However the end result was similar, with a Germanic-speaking military class, the [[Anglo-Saxons]], taking over administration of what remained of Roman society, and conflict between an unknown number of regional powers. While major parts of Gaul and Britain redefined themselves ethnically on the basis of their new rulers, as [[West Francia|Francia]] and [[England]], in England the main population also became Germanic speaking. The exact reasons for the difference are uncertain, but significant levels of migration played a role.{{sfn|Halsall|2013}}\n\nIn 476 [[Odoacer]], a Roman soldier who came from the tribes of the Middle Danube in the aftermath of Nedao, became King of Italy, removing the last western emperors from power. He was murdered and replaced in 493 by [[Theoderic the Great]], described as [[King of the Ostrogoths]], one of the most powerful Middle Danube peoples of the old Hun alliance. Theoderic had been raised up and supported by the eastern emperors, and his administration continued a sophisticated Roman administration, in cooperation with the traditional [[Roman senate|Roman senatorial]] class. Similarly, Roman lifestyles continued in North Africa under the Vandals, Savoy under the Burgundians, and within the Visigothic realm.\n\nThe Ostrogothic kingdom ended in 542 when the eastern emperor [[Justinian]] made a last great effort to reconquer the [[Western Mediterranean]]. The conflicts destroyed the Italian senatorial class.{{sfn|Geary|2002|p=113}} The eastern empire was also unable to hold Italy for long, and in 568 the [[Lombards|Lombard]] king [[Alboin]], a Suebian people who had entered the Middle Danubian region from the north conquering and partly absorbing the frontier peoples there, entered Italy and created the Italian [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] there. These Lombards now included Suevi, [[Heruli]], [[Gepids]], [[Bavarians]], Bulgars, Avars, Saxons, Goths, and [[Thuringians]]. As Peter Heather has written these \"peoples\" were no longer peoples in any traditional sense.<ref>{{harvtxt|Heather|2009|p=240}}, citing [[Paul the Deacon]].</ref>\n\nOlder accounts which describe a long period of massive movements of peoples and military invasions are over-simplified, and only describe specific incidents. According to [[Herwig Wolfram]], the Germanic peoples did not and could not \"conquer the more advanced Roman world\" nor were they able to \"restore it as a political and economic entity\"; instead, he asserts that the empire's \"universalism\" was replaced by \"tribal particularism\" which gave way to \"regional patriotism\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=308}} The Germanic peoples who overran the Western Roman Empire probably numbered less than 100,000 people per tribe, including approximately 15,000-20,000 warriors. They constituted a tiny minority of the population in the lands over which they seized control.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Wolfram|1997|p=7}}: \"[T]hese tribes were surprisingly small: fifteen to twenty thousand warriors\u2014which means a total of about one hundred thousand people in a tribe\u2014was the maximum number a large people could raise... These people are likewise presented as conquerors of the Roman Empire, even though they constituted a vanishing minority within it.\"}}\n\nApart from the common history many of them had in the Roman military, and on Roman frontiers, a new and longer-term unifying factor for the new kingdoms was that by 500, the start of the [[Middle Ages]], most of the old Western empire had converted to the same Rome-based [[Catholicism|Catholic]] form of [[Christianity]]. A key turning point was the conversion of Clovis I in 508. Before this point, many of the Germanic kingdoms, such as the Goths and Burgundians, were [[Arianism|Arian]] Christians - a form of Christianity which they perhaps took up in the time of the Arian emperor [[Valens]], but which was now considered a heresy.\n\n===Early Middle Ages===\n{{Main|Early Middle Ages}}\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Franks expansion.gif|thumb|upright=1.15|Frankish expansion from the early kingdom of [[Clovis I]] (481) to the divisions of [[Carolingian Empire|Charlemagne's Empire]] (843/870)]]\n[[File:Viking Expansion.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Map showing area of [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlements during the [[Viking Age]], including [[Normans|Norman]] conquests]]\nIn the centuries after 568, the [[Visigothic kingdom]], by now centred in Spain, was ended by the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] in the 8th century. Much of continental catholic Europe became part of a greater [[Francia]] under the [[Merovingian]] and then the [[Carolingian dynasty]], which began with [[Pepin the Short]], the son of [[Charles Martel]]. Charles, though not a king, reconsolidated the Frankish kingdom's dominance over Saxons, Frisians, Bavarians and Burgundians, and defeated the Umayyads at the 732 [[Battle of Tours]]. Pepin's son [[Charlemagne]] conquered the Lombards in 774, and in an important turning point in European history, was crowned as emperor by [[Pope Leo III]] in Rome on Christmas Day, 800 CE. This consolidated a shift in the power structure from the south to the north, and was also a strong symbolic link to Rome and the Roman Christianity. The core of the new empire included what is now France, Germany and the [[Benelux]] countries. The empire laid the foundations for the medieval and early modern ''[[ancien regime]]'', finally destroyed only by the [[French Revolution]]. The Frankish-Catholic way of doing politics and war and religion also had a strong effect upon all neighbouring regions, including what became England, Spain, Italy, Austria, and Bohemia.\n\nThe effect of old Germanic culture on this new Latin-using empire is a topic of dispute, because there was much continuity with the old Roman legal systems, and the increasingly important Christian religion. An example which is argued to show an influence of earlier Germanic culture is law. The new kingdoms created new law codes in Latin, with occasional Germanic words.{{sfn|Liebeschuetz|2015|p=97}} These were Roman-influenced, and under strong church influence all law was increasingly standardized to accord with Christian philosophy, and old Roman law.{{sfn|Geary|2002|pp=123-128,137-138}}\n\nGermanic languages in western Europe also faded out of use in most areas apart from the West Germanic group of related languages including England, the \"[[Austrasia]]n\" Frankish homelands near the Lower Rhine, Maas and Scheldt rivers, and the large area between the Rhine and Elbe. With the splitting off of this latter area within the Frankish empire, the first ever political entity corresponding loosely to modern \"Germany\" came into existence.\n\nIn [[Eastern Europe]] the once relatively developed periphery of the Roman world collapsed culturally and economically, and this can be seen in the Germanic-associated archaeological evidence: in the area of today's southern Poland and Ukraine the collapse was not long after 400, and by 700 Germanic material culture was entirely west of the Elbe in the area where the Romans had been active since Caesar's time, and the Franks were now active. East of the Elbe was to become mainly [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] speaking.{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=371-372}}\n\nOutside of the Roman-influenced zone, Germanic-speaking Scandinavia was in the [[Vendel period]] and eventually entered the [[Viking Age]], with [[Viking expansion|expansion]] to [[Danelaw|Britain]], Ireland and [[history of Iceland|Iceland]] in the west and as far as [[Rus Khaganate|Russia]] and [[Varangians|Greece]] in the east.<ref>{{harvtxt|Derry|2012|pp=16\u201335}}; {{harvtxt|Clements|2005|pp=214\u2013229}}; {{harvtxt|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=310}}</ref> Swedish Vikings, known locally as the [[Rus' people|Rus']], ventured deep into Russia, where they founded the political entities of [[Kievan Rus']].

On the other hand, the Scandinavian countries were, starting with Denmark, under the influence of Germany to their south, and also the lands where they had colonies. Bit by bit they became Christian, and organized themselves into Frankish- and Catholic-influenced kingdoms.\n\n[[File:Holy Roman Empire 11th century map-en.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Kingdom of Germany]] (''Regnum Teutonicum'') within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], circa 1000 AD]]\n\n==Roman descriptions of early Germanic people and culture==\n{{See|Germanic culture|Early Germanic culture}}\nCaesar and Tacitus gave colorful descriptions of the Germanic peoples, but scholars note that these need to be viewed cautiously. For one thing, many of the tropes used, such as concerning the red or blond hair, the blue eyes, and the undisciplined emotions of the Germanic peoples, were old ones that had long been used for any northern peoples such as Gauls. Secondly, the Germanic descriptions of both authors are recognized as having been intended to be both critical of Roman moral softness, and pushing for specific foreign policies.\n\nTacitus famously described the Germanic people as ethnically \"unmixed\", which had an influence on pre-1945 German racist nationalism. It was not necessarily meant to be purely positive:\n:For my own part, I agree with those who think that the tribes of Germany are free from all taint of inter-marriages with foreign nations, and that they appear as a distinct, unmixed race, like none but themselves. Hence, too, the same physical peculiarities throughout so vast a population. All have fierce blue eyes, red hair, huge frames, fit only for a sudden exertion. They are less able to bear laborious work. Heat and thirst they cannot in the least endure; to cold and hunger their climate and their soil inure them.<ref name=tac4>{{harvtxt|Tacitus|2009|p=39}} ''Germania'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:4 4].</ref>\n\nModern scholars point out that one way of interpreting such remarks is that it is consistent with other comments by Tacitus indicating that the Germanic people lived very remotely, in unattractive countries, for example in the next part of the text:\n:Their country, though somewhat various in appearance, yet generally either bristles with forests or reeks with swamps; it is more rainy on the side of Gaul, bleaker on that of Noricum and Pannonia. It is productive of grain, but unfavourable to fruit-bearing trees; it is rich in flocks and herds, but these are for the most part undersized, and even the cattle have not their usual beauty or noble head. <ref name=tac5>{{harvtxt|Tacitus|2009|p=39}} ''Germania'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:5 5].</ref>\n\nArchaeological research has revealed that the early Germanic peoples were primarily agricultural, although husbandry and fishing were important sources of livelihood depending on the nature of the environment.{{sfn|Owen|1960|pp=166-174}} They carried out extensive trade with their neighbours, notably exporting amber, slaves, mercenaries and animal hides, and importing weapons, metals, glassware and coins in return.{{sfn|Owen|1960|pp=174-178}} They eventually came to excel at craftsmanship, particularly metalworking.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=23}} In many cases in fact, ancient Germanic smiths and other craftsmen produced products of higher quality than the Romans.{{Efn|\"Some smiths were able to rework iron into high-quality steel and make sword blades with a core of softer steel for flexibility and harder steel on the exterior to keep a sharp edge, far finer weapons than those used in the Roman army at the time.\"{{harvtxt|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=324}} \"Furthermore, the skills of Germanic smiths and other craftsmen were as good as, or better than those found inside the Roman empire.\"{{harvtxt|MacDowall|2000|p=16}} }}\n\nBefore Tacitus, Julius Caesar described the ''Germani'' and their customs in his ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', though in certain cases it is still a matter of debate if he refers to Northern [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes or clearly identified Germanic tribes. Caesar notes that the Gauls had earlier dominated and sent colonies into the lands of the Germans, but that the Gauls had since degenerated under the influence of Roman civilization, and now considered themselves inferior in military prowess.{{Efn|{{harvtxt|Caesar|2019|pp=156, 6.24}}: \"Proximity to our provinces and familiarity with seaborne imports bring the Gauls many things to use and keep, so they gradually grew accustomed to defeat, losing many battles and not even claiming to be the Germans' equals in courage now.\" {{harvtxt|Caesar|2019|pp=29, 1.39}}: \"[O]ur men inquired and heard Gauls and merchants describing the Germans' huge bodies, their incredible strength, and their experience in arms.

They rank in the number of the gods those alone whom they behold, and by whose instrumentality they are obviously benefited, namely, the sun, fire, and the moon; they have not heard of the other deities even by report. Their whole life is occupied in hunting and in the pursuits of the military art; from childhood they devote themselves to fatigue and hardships. Those who have remained [[chaste]] for the longest time, receive the greatest commendation among their people; they think that by this the growth is promoted, by this the physical powers are increased and the sinews are strengthened. And to have had knowledge of a woman before the twentieth year they reckon among the most disgraceful acts; of which matter there is no concealment, because they bathe promiscuously in the rivers and [only] use skins or small cloaks of deer's hides, a large portion of the body being in consequence naked.<ref>Caesar, ''Gallic Wars'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0448.phi001.perseus-eng1:6.21 6.21].</ref>\n\n:They do not pay much attention to agriculture, and a large portion of their food consists in milk, cheese, and flesh; nor has any one a fixed quantity of land or his own individual limits; but the magistrates and the leading men each year apportion to the tribes and families, who have united together, as much land as, and in the place in which, they think proper, and the year after compel them to remove elsewhere.<ref>{{harvtxt|Caesar|2019|pp=153\u2013154}}, ''Gallic Wars'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0448.phi001.perseus-eng1:6.22 6.22].</ref>\n\n==Genetics==\n[[File:Percentage of major Y-DNA haplogroups in Europe.png|thumb|275px|Percentage of major [[Y-DNA]] haplogroups in Europe; [[Haplogroup I1]] represented by light blue.]]\nIn a 2013 book which reviewed studies up until then it was remarked that: \"If and when scientists find ancient [[Y-DNA]] from men whom we can guess spoke Proto-Germanic, it is most likely to be a mixture of [[haplogroup I1 (Y-DNA)|haplogroup I1]], [[Haplogroup R1a#R-Z282_(R1a1a1b1a)_(Eastern_Europe)|R1a1a]], [[Haplogroup R-M269#R-P312|R1b-P312]] and [[Haplogroup R-M269#R1b1a1a2a1a1_(R-U106)|R1b-106]]\".

Older terms include \"Gothonic\" used by the Danish writer [[Gudmund Sch\u00fctte]], before [[World War II]] and \"Early Germans\" used in a book title by Malcolm Todd {{harv|Todd|2004}}. For criticism of using \"Germans\" see for example {{harvtxt|Wolfram|1988|p=10-13}}, {{harvtxt|Halsall|2014}}. Compare also to the influential old definition in German by the Grimm brothers for \"der Germane\" ({{harvcoltxt|Grimm|Grimm}}).}} They are also associated with [[Germanic languages]], which many of them probably spoke.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Wolfram|1997|p=3}}: \"There was a time where it was possible to say: 'The name Germanic peoples refers to those ethnic tribes who spoke a Germanic language'.\" {{harvtxt|Pohl|2004a|p=47}}: \"F\u00fcr die Zusammenarbeit der Disziplinen ist festzuhalten, dass die von der Philologie rekonstruierten Sprachen, wie eben das Germanische, Abstraktionen sind...\". {{harvtxt|Burns|2003|p=20}}: \"...there was always a problem with early Germanic because only fourth-century Gothic is extant as a written Germanic language prior to the ninth century...\"}} Starting with [[Julius Caesar]] (100-44 BCE), several Roman authors placed their homeland, ''[[Germania]]'', roughly between the [[Lower Rhine]] and the [[Vistula]], and distinguished them from other broad categories of peoples better known to Rome, especially the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Gauls]] to their southwest, and \"[[Scythians|Scythian]]\" [[Sarmatians]] to their southeast.<ref>{{harvtxt|Wolfram|1997|p=5-6}}; {{harvtxt|M\u00fcller|1998|p=14}}.</ref> Greek writers, in contrast, consistently categorized the Germanic peoples from east of the Rhine as a type of Gaul.{{sfn|Pohl|2004a|p=51}}\n\nWith the possible exception of some tribes near the Rhine, there is no evidence that the Germanic peoples called themselves or their lands \"Germanic\" (see [[:#Definitions of Germanic peoples#Later Roman \"Germanic peoples\"|below]]).<ref>{{harvtxt|Todd|2004|p=8-9}}; {{harvtxt|M\u00fcller|1998|p=14}}.</ref> Latin and Greek writers report centuries of historical interactions with Germanic peoples on the Rhine and Danube, but from about 400, several long-established Germanic peoples on the [[Middle Danube]] were replaced by newcomers from the north or east. The description of peoples as \"Germanic\" in [[late antiquity]] was mainly restricted to the Rhine region, and thus especially referred to the [[Franks]], and sometimes also the [[Alamanni]].\n\nBroader modern definitions of the Germanic peoples include peoples who were not known as ''Germani'' or Germanic peoples in their own time, but who are treated as one group of cultures, mostly because of their use of Germanic languages.{{efn|This approach is sometimes questioned. {{harvtxt|Burns|2003|p=20}}: \"Concurrent with the creation of these linguistic theories, historians and politicians integrated them into their justifications and explanations of the rise of the nation-state, which is now again in question.\" {{harvtxt|Halsall|2014|p=520}}, using the [[Goths|Gothic peoples]] as an example: \"Linguistically, we can justify a grouping on the basis that all these peoples spoke a related form of Indo-European language, whether East, West or North Germanic. Such a modern definition, however, does not equate with the classical idea of the Germani.\" {{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|p=222}}: \"No discernible benefit comes from out being reminded again and again in modern writings that many of these barbarians at each other's throats probably spoke dialects of the same language. The G-word can be dispensed with.\"}} Thus, in modern writing, \"Germanic peoples\" is a term which commonly includes peoples who were not referred to as Germanic by contemporaries, and spoke distinct languages, only categorized as Germanic in modern times. Examples include the late Roman [[Goths]], and the medieval [[Norse language|Norse]]-speaking Vikings.\n\nThe languages of the earliest known Germanic peoples of [[classical antiquity]] have left only fragmentary evidence. The first long texts which have survived were written outside ''Germania'' in the [[Gothic language]] from the region that is today [[Ukraine]] and in [[Old English]] from the British Isles.{{sfn|Todd|2004|p=11}} Languages in this family are widespread today in Europe, and have dispersed worldwide, the family being represented by major modern languages such as [[English language|English]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[North Germanic languages|Nordic languages]] and [[German language|German]]. The [[Eastern Germanic]] branch of the Germanic language family, once found in what is now Poland and the Ukraine, is extinct.\n\nApart from language and geography, proposed connections between the diverse Germanic peoples described by classical and medieval sources, archaeology, and linguistics are the subject of ongoing debate among scholars:\n*On the one hand there is doubt about whether late Roman-era Germanic peoples should be treated as unified by any single unique shared [[culture]], [[collective consciousness]], or even language.<ref>{{harvtxt|M\u00fcller|1998|p=14-15}}; {{harvtxt|Liebeschuetz|2015|p=97}}; {{harvtxt|Pohl|2004a|pp=47,50-51}}.</ref> For example, the tendency of some historians to describe late Roman historical events in terms of Germanic language speakers has been criticized by other scholars because it implies a single coordinated group. [[Walter Goffart]] has gone so far as to suggest that historians should avoid the term when discussing that period.<ref>{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|loc=Preface}}: \"Strange as it may seem to hear it said, there were no Germanic peoples in late antiquity. The illusion that there were can be outgrown.\"</ref>\n*On the other hand, there is a connected debate concerning the extent to which any significant Germanic traditions apart from language, even smaller scale tribal traditions, survived ''after'' Roman times, when new political entities formed in Europe after the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. Some of these new entities are seen as precursors of European [[nation states]] that have survived into modern times, such as [[English people|England]] and [[French people|France]], and so such proposed connections back to medieval and classical barbarian nations were important to many of the [[Romanticism|Romanticist]] [[nationalist]] movements, which developed across Europe in modern times{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=13}} (The most notable of these has been \"[[Germanicism]]\", which saw [[Germans]] especially as direct heirs of a single Europe-conquering Germanic race and culture - a popular narrative which helped inspire [[Nazism]].<ref>See for example {{harvtxt|Wolfram|1988|p=10-13}}, {{harvtxt|Halsall|2014}}.</ref>) In contrast, more complex proposals about continuity today, such as those proposed by [[:de:Reinhard Wenskus|Reinhard Wenskus]], tend to focus on the possibility of more limited \"kernels\" of cultural traditions, which can be carried by relatively small groups with, or without, large-scale migrations.<ref>Examples: {{harvtxt|Heather|2009|pp=13-14,19-20}}; {{harvtxt|Halsall|2007|pp=14-15}}; {{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|pp=50-51}}</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century, genetic studies have begun to look more systematically at questions of ancestry, using both modern and ancient DNA. However, the connection between modern Germanic languages, ethnicity and genetic heritage is thought by many scholars to be unlikely to ever be simple or uncontroversial. [[Guy Halsall]] for example writes: \"The danger, barely addressed (at best dismissed as a purely \u2018ideological\u2019 objection), is of reducing ethnicity to biology and thus to something close to the nineteenth-century idea of race, at the basis of the \u2018nation state\u2019.\"{{sfn|Halsall|2014|p=518}}\n{{TOC limit|5}}\n\n==Definitions of Germanic peoples==\n{{Split section portions|date=March 2020|discuss=Talk:Germanic peoples#An article to define the scope of another article?}}\n===General===\nPossibly based on discussions with Gaulish allies during [[Gallic Wars|his campaign]] there, Julius Caesar published the first basic definition of what makes any people or peoples \"Germanic\", rather than for example Gaulish.{{sfn|Pohl|2004a|p=52-53}} This definition involved several criteria, allowing the possibility of debatable cases.<ref>{{harvtxt|Pohl|2006|p=100}}; {{harvtxt|M\u00fcller|1998|pp=8-10}}.</ref> Definitions of Germanic peoples continue to involve discussion of similar criteria:\n\n*Geography. The Germanic peoples are seen as peoples who originated, before Caesar's time, from somewhere between the Lower Rhine and Lower Vistula, so-called ''\"[[Germania]]\"''. Already for Caesar, use of this definition requires knowing which people moved away from this homeland.\n*Language. Tacitus already referred to Suebian languages as a way of determining if a people was Germanic. Scholars defined a family of Germanic languages, which at least some of the ''Germani'' spoke, for example the Suevi. \n*[[Culture]], in the sense of clothing, economy, cults, laws and lifestyle of the different Germanic peoples was already used by Tacitus and Caesar to help distinguish the ''Germani'' from other northern peoples. In modern times, archaeologists study the surviving physical evidence left by the peoples of ''Germania'', and they have defined various regional cultures. Of these, there is consensus that at least the [[Jastorf culture]], between the Elbe and [[Oder]] rivers, was Germanic-speaking already in the time of Caesar. In parallel, other scholars have looked for textual fragmentary evidence concerning the laws, legends and cults of these peoples, and scholars such as [[Dennis Howard Green]] have sought leads in the Germanic languages themselves.{{sfn|Green|2007}}\n\nIn modern times, attempts to define characteristics which unite all or some of these peoples more objectively, using linguistic or archaeological criteria, have thus led to the possibility of the term \"Germanic\" being used to apply to more peoples, in other periods and regions. However, these definitions are still based upon the old definitions, and overlap with them.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Pohl|2004a|p=9-10}}: \"Die Sprachwissenschaft kann weiterhin nach bestimmten Kriterien, etwa de 1. Lautverscheibung, die Entstehung der germanischen Sprache(n) definieren und grob zeitlich und r\u00e4umlch einordnen. Selbst wo sich dabei beachtliche \u00dcberschneidungen mit dem Verbreitungsgebiet einer arch\u00e4ologischen Kultur ergeben k\u00f6nnen (wie der eisenzeitlichen, vorr\u00f6mischen Jastorf-Kultur mit Zentrum an der Unterelbe), kann diese Bev\u00f6lkerung arch\u00e4ologisch nicht ohne weiteres als 'Germanen' definiert werden.\"}} \n\nSuch modern definitions have focused attention upon uncertainties and disagreements about the [[ethnogenesis|ethnic origins and backgrounds]] of both early Roman-era Germanic peoples, and late-Roman Germanic peoples.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Pohl|2006|p=103}}: \"what modern philology has accustomed us to see as one family of languages or even a single language was, with all its variants, not an instrument by which all its native speakers could easily comprehend each other.\"}} \n\n===Roman ethnographic writing, from Caesar to Tacitus===\nAccording to all available evidence, the theoretical concept of the Germanic peoples as a large grouping distinct from the Gauls\u2014whose homeland was east of the Rhine, and included areas very far from it\u2014originated with Julius Caesar's published account of his \"[[Gallic Wars]]\", and specifically those parts concerning his battles near the Rhine. Importantly for all future conceptions of what Germanic means, Caesar was apparently the first to categorize distant peoples such as the [[Cimbri]] and the large group of [[Suevi|Suebian peoples]] as \"Germanic\".{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1998|loc=p.6 col.2}} The Suevians and their languages, which had perhaps never been called Germanic before then, had started expanding their influence in his time, as Caesar experienced personally.{{sfn|Pohl|2004a|p=13}} Caesar's categorization of the ''Germani'' was in the context of explaining his battle against [[Ariovistus]], who had been a Roman ally. He led a large and armed population, made up of several peoples from east of the Rhine, including significant Suebian contingents.<ref>Caesar, ''Gallic Wars'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0448.phi001.perseus-eng1:1.51 1.51]. Also Harudes, Marcomanni, Tribocci, Vangiones, Nemetes, and Sedusii were listed. See [[Germanic_peoples#1st_century_BCE:_Julius_Caesar|below]].</ref> Rome had suffered a history of Gaulish invasions from the distant north, including those by the [[Cimbri]], whom they had previously categorized as Gauls. Caesar, while describing his subsequent use of Roman soldiers deep in Gaulish territory, categorized the Cimbri, together with the peoples allied under Ariovistus, not as Gaulish, but as \"Germanic\", apparently using an ethnic term that was more local to the Rhine region where he fought Ariovistus. Modern scholars are undecided about whether the Cimbri were Germanic speakers like the Suebians, and even where exactly they lived in northern Europe, though it is likely to have been in or near [[Jutland]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Pohl|2006|p=11}}; {{harvtxt|Kaul|Martens|1995}}; {{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|p=282}}.</ref> Caesar thus proposed that these more distant peoples were the cause of invasions into Italy. His solution was controlling Gaul, and defending the Rhine as a boundary against these ''Germani''.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1998|pp=9-10}}\n\nSeveral Roman writers\u2014[[Strabo]] (about 63 BCE \u2013 24 CE), [[Pliny the Elder]] (about 23\u201379 CE), and especially [[Tacitus]] (about 56\u2013120 CE)\u2014followed Caesar's tradition in the next few generations, by partly defining the Germanic peoples of their time geographically, according to their presumed homeland. This \"''Germania magna''\", or Greater ''Germania'', was seen as a large wild country roughly east of the [[Rhine]], and north of the [[Danube]], but not everyone from within the area bounded by those rivers was ever described by Roman authors as Germanic, and not all ''Germani'' lived there.{{sfn|Liebeschuetz|2002|p=59-60}} The opening of Tacitus's ''Germania'' gave a rough definition only:\n<blockquote>Germania is separated from the Gauls, the [[Rhaetians]], and [[List_of_ancient_tribes_in_Illyria#Pannonian_tribes|Pannonii]], by the rivers Rhine and Danube. Mountain ranges, or the fear which each feels for the other, divide it from the [[Sarmatians]] and [[Dacians]].<ref name=tac1>Tacitus, ''Germania'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:1 1].</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt is the northern part of Greater ''Germania'', including the [[North European Plain]], Southern [[Scandinavia]], and the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast that was presumed to be the original Germanic homeland by early Roman authors such as Caesar and Tacitus. (Modern scholars also see the central part of this area, between the Elbe and the Oder, as the region from which Germanic languages dispersed.<ref>See [[Germanic_peoples#Languages|below]].</ref>) In the east, ''Germania magna's'' boundaries were unclear according to Tacitus, although geographers such as Ptolemy and [[Pomponius Mela]] took it to be the [[Vistula]].<ref>Tacitus, ''Germania'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:45 45]-[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:46 46]; Ptolemy, ''Geography'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Periods/Roman/_Texts/Ptolemy/3/5*.html 3.5] and [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Periods/Roman/_Texts/Ptolemy/2/10/limited.html 2.10]; Pomponius Mela, ''Description of the World'', [https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015042048507?urlappend=%3Bseq=122 31].</ref> For Tacitus the boundaries of Germania stretched further, to somewhere east of the Baltic Sea in the north, and its people blended with the \"Scythian\" (or Sarmatian) steppe peoples in the area of today's [[Ukraine]] in the south. In the north, greater ''Germania'' stretched all the way to the relatively unknown [[Arctic Ocean]]. In contrast, in the south of Greater ''Germania'' nearer the Danube, the Germanic peoples were seen by these Roman writers as immigrants or conquerors, living with other peoples whom they had come to dominate. More specifically, Tacitus noted various [[Suebi]]an Germanic-speaking peoples from the [[Elbe|Elbe river]] in the north, such as the [[Marcomanni]] and [[Quadi]], pushing into the [[Hercynian forest]] regions towards the Danube, where the Gaulish [[Volcae]], [[Helvetii]] and [[Boii]] had lived.<ref>Caesar, ''Gallic Wars'' 6.24; Tacitus, ''Germania''\n[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:28 28]; {{Harvtxt|Heather|2009|loc=p.6,p.53}}.</ref>\n\nRoman writers who added to Caesar's theoretical description, especially Tacitus, also at least partly defined the ''Germani'' by non-geographic criteria such as their economy, religion, clothing, and language. Caesar had, for example, previously noted that the ''Germani'' had no [[druids]], and were less interested in farming than Gauls, and also that [[Gaulish]] (''lingua gallica'') was a language the Germanic King Ariovistus had to learn.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=6}}<ref>Caesar, ''Gallic Wars'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0448.phi001.perseus-eng1:1.47 1.47], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0448.phi001.perseus-eng1:6.21 6.21].</ref> Tacitus mentioned Germanic language at least three times, all concerning eastern peoples whose ethnicity was uncertain, and such remarks are seen by some modern authors as evidence of a unifying Germanic language.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Liebeschuetz|2015|loc=p.95 n.4; p.97}} for example, argues that Tacitus described the ''Germani'' as united by language.</ref> His comments are not detailed, but they indicate that there were Suebian languages (plural) ''within'' the category of Germanic languages, and that customs varied between different Germanic peoples. For example:{{sfn|Pohl|2006|p=121}}\n*The [[Marsigni]] and [[Buri tribe|Buri]], near today's southern [[Silesia]], were Suebian in speech and culture and therefore among the ''Germani'' in a region where he says non-Germanic people also lived.<ref name=tac43>Tacitus, ''Germania'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:43 43].

Even the language from which it derives is a subject of dispute.{{efn|See for example {{harvtxt|Todd|2004|p=8-9}} and {{harvtxt|M\u00fcller|1998|p=80}}. The latter gives a detailed summary of some of the many proposals. {{harvtxt|Wolfram|1988|p=5}}, for example, thinks \"Germani\" must be Gaulish. Historian Wolfgang Pfeifer more or less concurs with Wolfram and surmises that the name Germani is likely of Celtic etymology, related in this case to the Old Irish word ''gair'' (neighbors) or could be tied to the Celtic word for their war cries ''gairm'', which simplifies into \"the neighbors\" or \"the screamers\".{{sfn|Pfeifer|2000|p=434}} But there is no consensus.}}\nWhatever it meant, the name probably applied originally only to a smaller group of people, the so-called \"''[[Germani cisrhenani]]''\", whose Latin scholarly name simply indicates that these were ''Germani'' living on the western side of the Rhine (see below).<ref>{{harvtxt|M\u00fcller|1998|p=4-5}}; {{harvtxt|Petrikovits|1999}}</ref> Tacitus reported that these Germanic peoples in Gaul, ancestors of the [[Tungri]] in his time, were the first people to be called ''Germani''.<ref name=tac2>Tacitus ''Germania'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:2 2]).</ref> According to Tacitus, their name had transferred to peoples such as those within the alliance of [[Ariovistus]], as a name having connotations that frightened potential enemies. While Caesar and Tacitus saw this Rhineland people as Germanic in the broader sense also, they do not fit easily with the much broader definitions of \"Germanic\" used by them or modern scholars. These original ''Germani'' are therefore a significant complication for all attempts to define the Germanic peoples according to which side of the Rhine they lived on, or according to their probable language.\n\n[[File:Two types of Germani.png|thumb|300px|The two main types of \"Germani\" in the time of Julius Caesar. (Approximate positions only.) Later Roman imperial provinces shown with red shading. On the Rhine are ''Germania Inferior'' (north) and ''Germania Superior'' (south).]]\nCaesar described how the country of these ''Germani cisrhenani'' stretched well west of the Lower Rhine, into modern [[Belgium]], and it had done so long before the Romans came into close contact. Neither Caesar nor Tacitus saw this as clashing with their broader definitions, because they believed these ''Germani'' had moved from east of the Rhine, where the other ''Germani'' lived. But this was not recent: Caesar reported that they were already on the west side during the [[Cimbrian War]] (113\u2013101 BCE), generations earlier.<ref>Caesar, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0448.phi001.perseus-eng1:2.4 2.4].</ref> The early ''Germani'' on both sides of the Lower Rhine were however distinguished from the Suebian ''Germani'' by Caesar, Tacitus, Pliny the Elder, and Strabo. Strabo even said that the ''Germani'' near the Rhine not only differed little from the Celts, but also that the Latin-speakers called them \"Germani\" because they were the \"genuine\" Gauls (which is a possible meaning of ''Germani'' in Latin).<ref name=strabo>Strabo, ''Geography'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-eng2:7.1.2 7.1.2].</ref> Pliny the Elder and Tacitus reported a tradition that the Lower Rhine ''Germani'' could be distinguished from the \"[[Ingaevones]]\" (who lived on the North Sea coast) as \"the [[Istaevones]]\", and the \"[[Herminones]]\" (who included the Suebian peoples) living inland of these groups (see below). Modern historical linguists and archaeologists have also come to doubt that these western ''Germani'' spoke a Germanic language as defined today, or shared the same [[material culture]], at least at the time of their first contact with Caesar and the Romans.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Roymans|2014|p=29}}: \"The archaeology of the Late Iron Age argues for a north-south articulation of the northwest European continent, in which the Rhine does not function as a cultural boundary. On the contrary, groups in the southern Netherlands and northern Belgium as well as in Hessen and southern Westphalia were strongly influenced by the La T\u00e8ne culture, as is shown by the presence of central places, sanctuaries, specialist glass and metalworking, and the adoption of coinage.\"}} Caesar himself refers to them also as Gauls.<ref>Caesar, ''Gallic War'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0448.phi001.perseus-eng1:6.34 6.34], for example, refers to the main tribe of these ''Germani'', the [[Eburones]] as Gauls.</ref>\n\nThe older concept of the ''Germani'' being local to the Rhine remained common among Graeco-Roman writers for a longer time than the more theoretical and general concept of Caesar.

It is believed by many scholars that the inscription should originally have referred to these Gaesatae.{{sfn|Polverini|1994|page=2}}\n*A third author sometimes thought to have written about the Germani is [[Pytheas]] of [[Marseille]], who wrote about northern Europe, but his works have not survived. Later reports of his writings show that he wrote about the areas and tribes later called Germanic but do not necessarily show that he called them Germanic.{{sfn|Christensen|2002}} (For example, Pliny the Elder says he described the Baltic Sea and mentioned a large country of \"Guiones\", often interpreted as the [[Gutones]], described by Tacitus. Their land included an estuary that is one day's sail from an island where [[amber]] was collected, which in turn neighbours the [[Teutones]], but an alternative interpretation is that these were (In)guiones (see below) on the North Sea coast.<ref>Pliny the elder, ''Natural History'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:4.27 4.27(/\"13\")] and [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:37.11 37.11(/\"7\")]. See {{harvtxt|Timpe|1989|p=330}}.</ref>)\n\nAfter Caesar, Roman authors such as Tacitus followed his example in using the Germanic terminology to refer retroactively to peoples known to the Romans or Greeks before Caesar. As noted above, the Cimbri had previously been described as Celtic or [[Cimmerian]], and Greek writers continued to do so, while  Caesar described them as Germanic. Tacitus and Strabo both proposed with some uncertainty that the [[Bastarnae]], a large people known to the Graeco-Roman world before Caesar, from the region of what is now [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Ukrainian Galicia]] and [[Moldavia|Moldava]], might also have had mixed Germanic ancestry, and according to Tacitus, even a Germanic language. Pliny the Elder categorized them as a separate major division of the ''Germani'' like Istvaeones, Ingvaeones, and Irminones, but also separate from an eastern group which contained the [[Vandals]] and the [[Gutones]], both in what is now Poland.<ref>Strabo, ''Geography'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-eng2:7.3.17 7.3.17]; Tacitus, ''Germania'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:46 46]; Pliny, ''Natural History'',[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:4.28 4.28].</ref> (As already mentioned however, [[Livy]] said they spoke a language like the [[Scordisci]].<ref>Livy, ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri|History of Rome]]'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0914.phi00140.perseus-eng3:57 40.57].</ref>)\n\n===Later Roman \"Germanic peoples\"===\nThe theoretical descriptions of Germanic peoples by Tacitus, which have been very influential in modern times, may never have been commonly read or used in the Roman era.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=49}} It is clear in any case that in later Roman times the Rhine frontier (or ''[[Limes Germanicus]]''), the area where Caesar had first come in contact with Suevians and ''Germani cisrhenani'', was the normal \"Germanic\" area mentioned in writing. [[Walter Goffart]] has written that \"the one incontrovertible Germanic thing\" in the Roman era was \"the two Roman provinces of 'Germania,' on the middle and lower course of the Rhine river\" and: \"Whatever 'Germania' had meant to Tacitus, it had narrowed by the time of [[Jerome|St Jerome]] to an archaic or poetic term for the land normally called [[Austrasia|Francia]]\".<ref>{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|p=187}} and {{harvtxt|Goffart|1989|p=112-113}}.</ref> Edward James similarly wrote:\n<blockquote>It seems clear that in the fourth century 'German' was no longer a term which included all western barbarians. [...] [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], in the later fourth century, only uses ''Germania'' when he is referring to the Roman provinces of Upper Germany and Lower Germany; east of ''Germania'' are ''Alamannia'' and ''Francia''.{{sfn|James|2009|p=29}}</blockquote>\n\nAs an exceptional case, the poet [[Sidonius Apollinaris]], living in what is now southern France, described the [[Burgundians]] of his time as speaking a \"Germanic\" tongue and being \"''Germani''\". Wolfram has proposed that this word was chosen not because of a comparison of languages, but because the Burgundians had come from the Rhine region, and even argued that the use of this word by Sidonius might be seen as evidence against Burgundians being speakers of [[East Germanic]], given that the East Germanic speaking Goths, also present in southern France at this time, were never described this way.{{efn|{{Harvtxt|Wolfram|1997|p=259}} cites his letter 5, to his friend Syagrius. In contrast, the use of this word by Sidonius is apparently seen differently for example by {{Harvtxt|Liebeschuetz|2015|p=157}}, citing Sidonius Apollinaris, ''Carm.'' 12.4.}}\n\nFar from the Rhine, the Gothic peoples in what is today Ukraine, and the Anglo-Saxons in the British Isles, were only called Germanic in one surviving classical text, by [[Zosimus]] (5th century), but only in a case where he mistakenly believed he was writing about Rhineland peoples.{{sfn|Pohl|2004b|p=172}} Otherwise, Goths and similar peoples such as the Gepids, were consistently described as Scythian.\n\n===Medieval loss of the \"Germanic people\" concept===\nIn the Greek-speaking eastern Roman empire which continued to exist in the Middle ages, the Germanic concept was also lost or distorted. As explained by Walter Pohl, the late Roman equation of the Franks to the Germani led there to such non-classical contrasts as the French (West Franks) being ''Germani'' and the Germans (East Franks) being ''Alamanni'', or the [[Italo-Normans|Normans in Sicily]] being Franks, but the French being \"Franks and also ''Germani''\". In the [[Strategikon of Maurice|''Strategikon'' of Maurice]], written about 600, a contrast is made between three types of barbarian: Scythians, [[Slavs]], and \"blonde-haired\" peoples such as the Franks and Langobards - apparently having no convenient name to cover them together.{{sfn|Pohl|2004b|pp=171-172}}\n\nMedieval writers in western Europe used Caesar's old geographical concept of ''Germania'', which, like the new Frankish and clerical jurisdictions of their time, used the Rhine as a frontier marker, although they did not commonly refer to any contemporary ''Germani''. For example, [[Louis the German]] (''{{lang|la|Ludovicus Germanicus}}'') was named this way because he ruled east of the Rhine, and in contrast the kingdom west of the Rhine was still called ''Gallia'' (Gaul) in scholarly Latin.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=11}}\n\nWriters using Latin in [[West Germanic]]-speaking areas did recognize that those languages were related (Dutch, English, [[Lombardic language|Lombardic]], and German). To describe this they referred to \"Teutonic\" words and languages, seeing this as a Latin translation of ''[[Theodiscus]]'', which was a concept that West Germanic speakers used to refer to themselves. It is the source of the modern words \"[[wikt:Dutch|Dutch]]\", German \"[[wikt:Deutsch|Deutsch]]\", and Italian \"[[wikt:Tedesco|Tedesco]]\". [[Romance language]] speakers and others such as the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] were contrasted using words based on another old word, ''[[Walhaz]]'', the source of \"Welsh\", [[Wallach]], [[Welsch]], [[wikt:Walloon|Walloon]], etc., itself coming from the name of the [[Volcae]], a Celtic tribe.<ref name=\"Ringe 2009\">Ringe, Don. \"[http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1012 Inheritance versus lexical borrowing: a case with decisive sound-change evidence].\" ''Language Log,'' January 2009.</ref> Only a small number of writers were influenced by Tacitus, whose work was known at [[Fulda Abbey]], and few used terminology such as ''lingua Germanica'' instead of ''theudiscus sermo''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|loc= p.278 & 282}}; {{harvtxt|Goffart|1989|p=153}}.</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, there were several more origin myths written after Jordanes (see above) which similarly connected some of the post Roman peoples to a common origin in Scandinavia. As pointed out by Walter Pohl, Paul the Deacon even implied that the Goths, like the Lombards, ''descended from'' \"Germanic peoples\", though it is unclear if they continued to be \"Germanic\" after leaving the north.{{sfn|Pohl|2004b|p=174}} [[Freculf|Frechulf of Lisieux]], noted that some believed that the Goths might belong to the \"''nationes Theotistae''\", like the Franks, and that both the Franks and the Goths might have come from Scandinavia.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=46}} It is in this period, the 9th century [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian era]], that scholars are also first recorded speculating about relationships between Gothic and West Germanic languages. [[Smaragdus of Saint-Mihiel]] believed the Goths spoke a ''teodisca lingua'' like the Franks, and [[Walafrid Strabo]], calling it a ''theotiscus sermo'', was even aware of their Bible translation. However, though the similarities were noticed, Gothic would not have been intelligible to a West Germanic speaker.{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=409-413}}\n\nThe first detailed origins legend of the Anglo-Saxons was by [[Bede]] (died 735), and in his case he named the Angles and Saxons of Britain as tribes who once lived in ''Germania'', like, he says, the [[Frisians]], [[Rugians]], [[Danes]], [[Huns]], Old [[Saxons]] (''Antiqui Saxones'') and the [[Bructeri]]. He even says that British people still call them, corruptly, ''\"Garmani\"''. As with Jordanes and the Gutones, there is other evidence, linguistic and archaeological, which is consistent with his scholarly account, although this does not prove that Bede's non-scholarly contemporaries had accurate knowledge of historical details.<ref>{{harvtxt|Halsall|2007|p=198}}; Bede, ''History'', [https://archive.org/details/venerablebedesec00bede/page/246/mode/2up 5.9].</ref>\n\nIn western Europe then, there was a small scholarly awareness of the Tacitean \"Germanic peoples\", and even their potential connection to the Goths, but much more common were adherence to Caesar's concept of the geographical meaning of ''Germania'' east of the Rhine, and a perception of similarities between some Germanic languages - though they were not given this name until much later.\n\n\n==Later debates==\n===The influence of Jordanes and the ''Origo Gentes'' genre===\nThe ethnic military kingdoms which formed in the western Roman empire (see [[Germanic peoples#5th century. The western empire divided into kingdoms|below]]) each developed their own legends about their ethnic origins, the so-called ''[[Origo gentis]]'' stories. These often included an ancient connection to Romans or [[Troy|Trojans]], as apparently in the stories of the Franks, Burgundians and English, and they also typically mentioned the wild east of \"Scythia\". However, [[Jordanes]] (6th century), who wrote the most detailed surviving Gothic origins story, did effectively propose a connection to northern regions which much earlier authors had described as the remotest parts of ''Germania'', and established a tradition of connecting the earliest origins of Goths and other peoples to [[Scandza|Scandinavia]], which was for him a distant and almost unknown island. He thus connected the Goths (''Gothi'') not only with ancient Amazons, Trojans, Huns, and the similarly-named [[Getae]], but also to the Baltic sea. Some modern writers, such as Wolfram and Heather, still see this as confirmed by the mention of similar sounding \"Gutones\" near the south Baltic coast in earlier authors such as Tacitus and Ptolemy.{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=115}} Others have noted that Jordanes himself believed the Goths would have left the region centuries before those writers, making the identification doubtful. Indeed, he or his sources must have derived the many of the names of ancient peoples and places from reading old Latin and Greek authors.{{sfn|Christensen|2002}}\n\nVery influentially, Jordanes called Scandinavia a \"womb of nations\" (''vagina nationum''), asserting that many peoples came from there in prehistoric times. This idea influenced later origin legends including the Lombard origin story, written by [[Paul the Deacon]] (8th century) who opens his work with an explanation of this theory. During the Carolingian renaissance he and other scholars even sometimes used the Germanic terminology.{{sfn|Pohl|2004b|p=174}} (See [[Germanic peoples#Medieval loss of the \"Germanic people\" concept|below]].) The Scandinavian theme continued to be influential in medieval times and has even been influential in early modern speculations about Germanic peoples, for example in proposals about not only Goths and Gepids, but also [[Rugii|Rugian]] and Burgundian origins.\n\nThe continuing use of Jordanes and similar writers to attempt to prove that the Goths were \"Germanic\" in more than language continues to arouse debate among scholars, because while his work is unreliable, the Baltic connection on its own is consistent with linguistic and archaeological evidence.<ref>Concerning the archaeological evidence, for the Gothic peoples see {{Harvtxt|Heather|2009|p=120}}.</ref> However, Walter Goffart in particular has criticized the methodology of many modern scholars for using Jordanes and other origins stories as independent sources of real tribal memories, but only when it matches their beliefs arrived at in other ways.<ref>{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|page=46-47}}; {{Harvtxt|Goffart|1989|p=29}}.</ref>\n\n===Modern \"Germanic\" debates and \"Germanism\"===\n{{See|Pan-Germanism|Viking revival|Gothicism|}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 118-30, Hermanns-Denkmal, Jungdeutsche Tagung.jpg|thumbnail|300px|An event of the [[Young German Order]] at the \"[[Hermannsdenkmal]]\" monument to [[Arminius]], in 1925.

By the late 15th century, [[Tacitus]] had become a focus of interest all around Europe, and, among other effects, this revolutionized ideas in Germany concerning the history of Germany itself. Tacitus continues to be an important influence in Germanic studies of antiquity, and is often read together with the ''[[Getica]]'' of [[Jordanes]]', who wrote much later.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|loc=43, pp.48ff}}\n<blockquote>Tacitus's ethnography won the attention it had formerly been denied because there now was a Germany, the \"German nation\" that had come into existence since the Carolingians, which Tacitus could now equip with a heaven-sent ancient dignity and pedigree.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=49}}</blockquote>\n\nIn this context, in the 19th century, the famous [[folklorist]] and linguist [[Jacob Grimm]] helped popularize the concept of Germanic languages as well as of [[Indo-european languages]]. Apart from the well-known [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]], collected with [[Wilhelm Grimm|his brother Wilhelm]], he published, for example, ''[[Deutsche Mythologie]]'' attempting to reconstruct [[Germanic mythology]], and a German dictionary ''[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]'' with detailed etymological proposals attempting to reconstruct the oldest Germanic language. He also popularized a new idea of these Germanic speakers, especially those in Germany, clinging valiantly to their supposed Germanic civilization over the centuries.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|p=48}} says: \"A whole library of nineteenth- and twentieth-century scholarship can be evoked to show that a \"Germanic antiquity\" existed in parallel to its Greco-Roman counterpart.\"}}\n\nThe subsequently popular modern assertion of strong cultural continuity between Roman-era ''Germani'' and medieval or modern Germanic speakers, especially Germans, assumed a strong connection between a family trees of language categories, and both cultural and racial heritages. The name of the newly defined language family, ''Germanic'', was long unpopular in other countries such as England, where the medieval \"Teutonic\" was seen as less potentially misleading.{{sfn|Chadwick|1945|p=143}} Similarly, in Denmark \"Gothic\" was sometimes used as a term for the language group uniting the ''Germani'' and the Goths, and a modified Gothonic was proposed by [[Gudmund Sch\u00fctte]] and used locally.{{sfn|Nielsen|2004}}\n\nThis [[Romanticism|romanticist]], [[nationalist]] approach has been rejected in its simplest forms since approximately [[World War II]]. For example, the once common habit of referring to Roman-era Germanic peoples as \"[[Germans]]\" is discouraged by modern historians, and modern [[Germans]] are no longer seen as the main successors of the ''Germani''.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|loc=Introduction}} Not only are ideas associated with [[Nazism]] now criticized, but also other romanticized ideas about the Germanic peoples. For example, Guy Halsall has mentioned the popularity of the \"view of the peoples of Germania as, essentially, proto-democratic communes of freemen\".{{sfn|Halsall|2014|p=516}} And [[Peter Heather]] has pointed out also that the [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory \"that some of Europe's barbarians were ultimately responsible for moving Europe onwards to the [[feudalism|feudal]] modern of production has also lost much of its force\".{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=614}}\n\nFurther, some historians now question whether there was any unifying Germanic culture even in Roman times, and secondly whether there was any significant continuity at all apart from language, connecting the Roman era Germanic peoples with the mixed new ethnic groups who formed in [[late antiquity]]. Skeptics of such connections include [[Walter Goffart]], and others associated with him and [[Toronto University]].{{sfn|Halsall|2014|p=18}} Goffart lists four \"contentions\" about how the Germanic terminology biases the conclusions of historians, and is therefore misleading:{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=7}}\n:1. Barbarian invasions should not be seen as a single collective movement. Different barbarian groups moved for their own reasons under their own leaders.\n:2. The pressures on the late Empire did not have a united source, and often came from within.\n:3. The classical Germanic peoples lacked any unity or center, and so they should not be seen as a civilization in the way Rome is.\n:4. We should not, according to Goffart, accept Jordanes as preserving an authentic oral tradition about a migration from Scandinavia.\n\nOn the other hand, the possibility of a small but significant \"core of tradition\" (''[[wikt:de:Traditionskern|Traditionskern]]'') surviving with the ruling classes of Roman Germanic peoples, in the societies of new medieval Germanic speaking peoples such as the [[Franks]], [[Alamanni]], [[Anglo-Saxons]], and [[Goths]], continues to be defended by other historians. This ''Traditionskern'' concept is associated for example with the [[Vienna School of History]], initiated by [[Reinhard Wenskus]], and later represented by scholars such as [[Herwig Wolfram]] and [[Walter Pohl]].\n\nPeter Heather for example, continues to use the Germanic terminology but writes that concerning proposals of Germanic continuity, \"all subsequent discussion has accepted and started from Wenskus's basic observations\" and \"the ''Germani'' in the first millenium were thus not closed groups with continuous histories\".{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=19}} Heather however believes that such caution now often goes too far in denying any large scale movements of people in specific cases, exemplified by [[Patrick Amory]]'s explanation of the [[Ostrogoths]] and their [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Kingdom]] of Italy.{{sfn|Heather|2007}}\n\nAnother proponent of relatively significant continuity, [[Wolf Liebeschuetz]], has argued that the shared use of Germanic languages by, for example, Anglo-Saxons and Goths, implies that they must have had more links to ''Germania'' than only language. While little concrete evidence has survived, Liebeschuetz proposes that the existence of [[Weregild]] laws, stipulating compensation payments to avoid blood feuds, must be Germanic because such laws were not Roman.{{sfn|Liebeschuetz|2015|pp=94-96}} Liebeschuetz also argues that recent sceptical scholars \"deprive the ancient Germans and their constituent tribes of any continuous identity\" and this is \"important\" because it makes European history a product of Roman history, not \"a joint creation of Roman and Germans\".{{sfn|Liebeschuetz|2015|p=90}}[[File:Nordic Bronze Age.png|thumb|upright=1|Map of the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] culture, around 1200 BCE]]\n\n==Prehistoric evidence==\n{{Further|Pre-Roman Iron Age}}\n[[File:Dejbjerg wagon, Nationalmuseet Copenhagen.jpg|thumb|upright=1|The Dejbjerg wagon, National Museum of Denmark]]\n\nCaesar, the original of the idea of the Germanic peoples, believed that in prehistory, before his time, the Rhine had divided these ''Germani'' from the Gauls. However, he noted that there must have already been significant movements in both directions, over the Rhine. Not only did he believe that the ''Germani'' have a long-standing tendency to make raids and group movements from the northeast, involving Germanic peoples such as the Cimbri long before him, and the Suevians in his time, it was also his understanding that there had been a time when the movement went in the opposite direction:\n<blockquote>And there was formerly a time when the Gauls excelled the Germans [''Germani''] in prowess, and waged war on them offensively, and, on account of the great number of their people and the insufficiency of their land, sent colonies over the Rhine . Accordingly, the [[Volcae]] [[Tectosages]], seized on those parts of Germany which are the most fruitful [and lie] around the Hercynian forest, (which, I perceive, was known by report to [[Eratosthenes]] and some other Greeks, and which they call Orcynia), and settled there.<ref>Caesar, ''Gallic Wars'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0448.phi001.perseus-eng1:6.24 6.24]</ref></blockquote>\n\nModern archaeologists disagree with this assessment and see no sign of such movements, seeing the Gaulish [[La T\u00e8ne culture]] as native to what is now southern Germany, and the La T\u00e8ne influenced cultures on both sides of the Lower Rhine in this period quite distinct from the Elbe Germanic peoples. On the other hand, the account of Caesar finds broad agreement with the archaeological record of the Celtic La T\u00e8ne culture first expanding to the north, influencing all cultures there, and then suddenly becoming scarce in the north. Subsequently the Jastorf culture expanded in all directions from the region between the lower Elbe and Oder rivers.\n=== Languages ===\n{{Main|Germanic languages|Proto-Germanic language|List of Germanic languages}}\nIt is believed that most of the early Germanic peoples spoke [[Germanic languages]].{{efn|{{harvtxt|Heather|2006|p=49|}} \"Germanic-speaking groups dominated most of central and northern Europe beyond Rome's riverine frontiers.

These La T\u00e8ne peoples, who included the ''Germani cisrhenani'', are generally considered unlikely to have spoken Germanic languages as defined today, though some may have spoken unknown related languages or Celtic dialects. To the north of these zones however, in southern Scandinavia and northern Germany, the archaeological cultures started to become more distinct from La T\u00e8ne culture during the Iron Age.<ref>{{harvtxt|Martens|2014}}</ref>\n\nConcerning Germanic speakers within these northern regions, the relatively well-defined [[Jastorf culture]] matches with the areas described by Tacitus, Pliny the elder and Strabo as Suevian homelands near the lower River Elbe, and stretching east on the Baltic coast to the [[Oder river]]. The Suevian peoples are seen by scholars as early [[West Germanic]] speakers. There is no consensus about whether neighbouring cultures in Scandinavia, Poland, and northwestern Germany were also part of a Germanic (or proto-Germanic)-speaking community at first, but this group of cultures were related to each other, and in contact. To the west of the Elbe for example, on what is now the German North Sea coast, was the so-called [[:de:Harpstedt-Nienburger Gruppe|Harpstedt-Nienburger Group]] between the Jastorf culture and the La T\u00e8ne influenced cultures of the Lower Rhine. To the east in what is now Poland was the [[Oksywie culture]], in the area where the later [[Wielbark culture]] developed, probably with the entry of [[East Germanic]] speakers. Related also to these and the Jastorf culture, was the [[Przeworsk culture]], which began as another La T\u00e8ne influenced local culture, and apparently became at least partly Germanic-speaking.\n\nThe Jastorf culture came into most direct contact with La T\u00e8ne cultures on the upper Elbe and Oder rivers, believed to correspond to the Celtic-speaking groups such as the Boii and Volcae described in this area by Roman sources. In the south of their range, the Jastorf and Przeworsk material cultures spread together, in the same direction.\n\n==Classical subdivisions==\n{{Further|Ing\u00e6vones|Herminones|Ist\u00e6vones}}\nBy the 1st century CE, the writings of [[Pliny the Elder]], and [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] reported a division of Germanic peoples into large groupings. Tacitus, in his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', specifically stated that one such division mentioned \"in old songs\" (''carminibus antiquis'') derived three such groups from three brothers, sons of [[Mannus]], who was son of an earth-born god, [[Tuisco|Tuisto]]. These terms are also sometimes used in older modern linguistic terminology, attempting to describe the divisions of later Germanic languages:\n*[[Ingvaeones]], nearest to the Ocean.\n*[[Herminones in the interior.\n*[[Istvaeones]], the remainder.<ref name=tac2/>\n\nOn the other hand, he wrote in the same passage that some believe that there are other groups which are just as old as these three, including \"the Marsi, Gambrivii, Suevi, Vandilii\". Of these, Tacitus only discussed the Suebi in detail, specifying that they were a very large grouping, with many tribes, with their own names. The largest, he said, was the [[Semnones]] near the Elbe, who \"claim that they are the oldest and the noblest of the Suebi.\"<ref name=tac2/>\n\n[[Pliny the Elder]], somewhat similarly, named five races of Germani in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia Naturalis]]'', with the same basic three groups as Tacitus, plus two more eastern blocks of Germans, the [[Vandals]], and further east the [[Bastarnae]]. He clarifies that the Istvaeones are near the Rhine, although he only gives one problematic example, the Cimbri. He also clarifies that the Suevi, though numerous, are actually in one of the three Mannus groups. His list:<ref> Plin. Nat. [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:4.28 4.28]</ref>\n*The [[Vandals|Vandili]], include the [[Burgundiones]], the [[Varini]], the [[Carini (Germanic tribe)|Carini]], and the [[Gutones]]. The Varini are listed by Tacitus as being Suebic, and the Gutones are described by him as Germanic, leaving open the question of whether they are Suebian.\n*The Ing\u00e6vones include the Cimbri, the Teutoni, and the tribes of the [[Chauci]].\n*The Ist\u00e6vones, who \"join up to the Rhine\", and including the Cimbri [sic, repeated, probably by error]\n*The Hermiones, forming a fourth, dwell in the interior, and include the Suevi, the [[Hermunduri]], the [[Chatti]], the [[Cherusci]],\n*The Peucini, who are also the [[Bastarnae|Bastern\u00e6]], adjoining the [[Dacians|Daci]].\n\nThese accounts and others from the period emphasize that the Suebi formed an especially large and powerful group. Tacitus speaks also of a geographical \"Suevia\" with two halves either side of the [[Sudetes]].<ref name=tac43/> The larger group that the Suevi were part of according to Pliny, the Hermiones, is mentioned in one other source: [[Pomponius Mela]] in his slightly earlier ''Description of the World,'' places \"the farthest people of [[Germania]], the Hermiones\" somewhere to the east of the Cimbri and the Teutones, apparently on the [[Baltic sea|Baltic]]. He did not mention Suebians.<ref>Pomponius Mela, ''Description of the World'', trans. F.E. Romer, 3.31\u20133.32</ref>\n\nStrabo, who focused mainly on ''Germani'' between the Elbe and Rhine, and does not mention the sons of Mannus, also set apart the names of ''Germani'' who are ''not'' Suevian, in two other groups, similarly implying three main divisions: \"smaller German tribes, as the Cherusci, Chatti, Gamabrivi, Chattuarii, and next the ocean the Sicambri, Chaubi, Bructeri, Cimbri, Cauci, Caulci, Campsiani\".<ref>Strabo, ''Geography'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-eng2:7.1.3 7.1.3]</ref>\n\nFrom the perspective of modern linguistic reconstructions, the classical ethnographers were not helpful in distinguishing two large groups that spoke types of Germanic very different from the Suebians and their neighbours, whose languages are the source of modern [[West Germanic]].\n*The Germanic peoples of the far north, in Scandinavia, were treated as Suebians by Tacitus, though their Germanic dialects would evolve into [[Proto Norse]], and later [[Old Norse]], as spoken by the [[Vikings]], and then the North Germanic language family of today.\n*The \"Gothic peoples\" who later formed large nations in the area that is today Ukraine, were not known to Tacitus, Pliny or Strabo, but their [[East Germanic]] languages are presumed to derive from languages spoken by Pliny's Vandal group (corresponding in part to the group made up of Gothones, Lemovii and Rugii described by Tacitus, who lived near the Baltic sea), and possibly also the Bastarnae.\nThe \"Gothic peoples\" in the territory of present-day Ukraine and Romania were seen by Graeco-Roman writers as culturally \"Scythian\", and not Germanic, and indeed some of them such as the Alans were clearly not Germanic-speaking either. Whether the Gothic-speaking groups among them had any consciousness of their connections to other Germanic-speaking peoples is a subject of dispute between scholars.\n\n==History==\n=== Earliest attestations ===\n\n==== Possible earliest contacts with the classical world (4th\u20133rd centuries BCE) ====\n{{Further|Pytheas|Bastarnae|Scirii}}\nBefore Julius Caesar, Romans and Greeks had very little contact with northern Europe itself.

He stayed there on the west of the Rhine. He was also accepted as an ally by the Roman senate.\n*58 BCE. Caesar, as governor of Gaul, took the side of the [[Aedui]] against Ariovistus and his allies. He reported that Ariovistus had already settled 120,000 of his people, was demanding land for 24,000 [[Harudes]] who subsequently defeated the Aedui, and had 100 clans of Suebi coming into Gaul.

Controversially, Caesar moved his attention to Northern Gaul. In 55 BCE he made a show of strength on the Lower Rhine, crossing it with a quickly made bridge, and then massacring a large migrating group of [[Tencteri]] and [[Usipetes]] who crossed the Rhine from the east. In the winter of 54/53 the [[Eburones]], the largest group of ''[[Germani cisrhenani]]'', revolted against the Romans and then dispersed into forests and swamps.\n::Caesar listed some ''Germani cisrhenani'' peoples: Eburones, [[Condrusi]], [[Caeraesi]], [[Paemani]] and [[Segni]].

This empire made costly campaigns to pacify and control the large region between the Rhine and Elbe. In the reign of his successor [[Tiberius]] it became a policy to leave the border at the Rhine, and expand the empire no further in that direction. The [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]], the extended family of Augustus, played close personal attention to management of this Germanic frontier, establishing a tradition followed by many future emperors. Major campaigns were led from the Rhine personally by [[Nero Claudius Drusus]], step-son of Augustus, then by his brother the future emperor Tiberius; next by the son of Drusus, [[Germanicus]] (father of the future emperor [[Caligula]] and grandfather of [[Nero]]).\n\nIn 38 BCE, [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]], consul of Transalpine Gaul, became the second Roman to lead forces over the Rhine.<ref>Cassius Dio, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/48*.html#49 48.49].</ref> In 31 BCE [[Gaius Carrinas (consul 43 BC)|Gaius Carrinas]] repulsed an attack by Suebi from east of the Rhine.<ref>Cassius Dio, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/51*.html#21 51.21].</ref> In 25 BCE [[Marcus Vinicius (consul 19 BC)|Marcus Vinicius]] took vengeance on some ''Germani'' in ''Germania'', who had killed Roman traders.<ref>Cassius Dio, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/53*.html#26 53.26].</ref> In 17/16 BCE at the [[Battle of Bibracte]] the [[Sugambri]], [[Usipetes]], and [[Tencteri]] crossed the Rhine and defeated the 5th legion under [[Marcus Lollius]], capturing the legion's eagle.\n\nFrom 13 BCE until 17 CE there were major Roman campaigns across the Rhine nearly every year, often led by the family of Augustus. First came the pacification of the Usipetes, Sicambri, and [[Frisians]] near the Rhine, then attacks increased further from the Rhine, on the [[Chauci]], [[Cherusci]], [[Chatti]] and [[Suevi]] (including the [[Marcomanni]]). These campaigns eventually reached and even crossed the Elbe, and in 5 CE Tiberius was able to show strength by having a Roman fleet enter the Elbe and meet the legions in the heart of ''Germania''. However, within this period two Germanic kings formed large anti-Roman alliances. Both of them, ironically, had spent some of their youth in Rome:\n*After 9 BCE, [[Maroboduus]] of the Marcomanni, had led his people away from the Roman activities into the [[Bohemia|Bohemian]] area, defended by forests and mountains, and formed alliances with other peoples. He was referred to as a king of the Suevians.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annales'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi005.perseus-eng1:2.26 2.26].</ref> In 6 CE Rome planned an attack but forces were needed for the [[Bellum Batonianum|Illyrian revolt]] in the Balkans, until 9 CE, at which time another problem arose in the north...\n*In 9 CE, [[Arminius]] of the Cherusci, initially an ally of Rome, drew the a large unsuspecting Roman force into a trap in northern Germany, and defeated [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]] at the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]. Tiberius and Germanicus spent the next few years recovering their dominance of northern Germany. They made Maroboduus an ally, and he did not assist Arminius.\n*17-18 CE, war broke out between Arminius and Maroboduus, with indecisive results.\n*19 CE, Marobduus was deposed by a rival claimant, perhaps supported by the Romans, and fled to Italy. He died in 37 CE. Germanicus also died, in [[Antioch]].\n*21 CE. Arminius died, murdered by opponents within his own tribe.\n\nStrabo, writing in this period in Greek, mentioned that apart from the area near the Rhine itself, the areas to the east were now inhabited by the Suevi, \"who are also named Germans, but are superior both in power and number to the others, whom they drove out, and who have now taken refuge on this side the Rhine\". Various peoples had fallen \"prey to the flames of war\".<ref>Strabo, ''Geography'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-eng2:4.3.4 4.3.4].</ref>\n\nThe Julio-Claudian dynasty also recruited northern Germanic warriors, particularly men of the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]], as personal bodyguards to the Roman emperor, forming the so-called [[Numerus Batavorum]].

The decision caused deep offense to the Batavi, and contributed to the outbreak of the [[Revolt of the Batavi]] in the following year which united ''Germani'' and Gauls, all connected to Rome but living both within the empire and outside it, over the Rhine.<ref>Tacitus, ''The History'', 2.5.[re-check]</ref> Their indirect successors were the ''[[Equites singulares Augusti]]'' which were, likewise, mainly recruited from the Germani.

The Romans claimed victory by 84 CE and Domitian also improved the frontier defenses of Roman ''Germania'', consolidating control of the ''[[Agri Decumates]]'', and converting ''Germania Inferior'' and ''Germania Superior'' into normal Roman provinces. In 89 CE the Chatti were allies of [[Lucius Antonius Saturninus]] in his failed revolt. <ref>{{harvtxt|Boatwright|Gargola|Talbert|2004|p=360}}{{harvtxt|Jones|1992|p=128}}</ref> Domitian, and his eventual successor [[Trajan]], also faced increasing concerns about an alliance on the Danube, of the Suevian Marcomanni and [[Quadi]], with the neighbouring Sarmatian [[Iazyges]], and it was in this area that dramatic events unfolded over the next few generations.

During the main war in 973 they were repulsed from the Rhine frontier to their west, along with their neighbours the Suevian [[Hermunduri]].\n*In 167, during the [[Antonine plague]] the Marcomanni, Quadi, and the Sarmatian Iazyges attacked and pushed their way to Italy where they besieged [[Aquileia]], triggering the main series of wars. A smaller group of [[Lombards]] also breached the border together with a group called the Obii, and they were defeated.\nOther peoples, perhaps not all Germanic, involved in various actions included the [[Costoboci]], the [[Hasdingi]] and [[Lacringi]] Vandals, the [[Varisci|Varisci (or Naristi)]] and the [[Cotini]] (not Germanic according to Tacitus), and possibly also the [[Buri tribe|Buri]].\n\nAfter these Marcomannic wars, the Middle Danube began to change, and in the next century the peoples living there tended to be referred to as Gothic, rather than Germanic.\n\n==== New names on the frontiers (170\u2013370) ====\n{{Further|Crisis of the Third Century}}\nBy the early 3rd century AD, large new groupings of Germanic people appeared near the Roman frontier, though not strongly unified. The first of these conglomerations mentioned in the historical sources were the [[Alamanni]] (a term meaning \"all men\") who appear in Roman texts sometime in the 3rd century CE.{{sfn|Geary|1999|p=109}} These are believed to have been a mixture of mainly Suebian peoples, who coalesced in the [[Agri Decumates]]. Emperor [[Severus Alexander]] was killed by his own soldiers in 235 CE for paying for peace with the Alamanni and the anti-aristocratic general [[Maximinus Thrax]] was elected to be emperor by the Pannonian army.{{sfn|Southern|2001|p=63}} According to the notoriously unreliable [[Augustan History]] (''Historia Augusta''), he was born in [[Thrace]] or [[Moesia]] to a [[Goths|Goth]]ic father and an [[Alans|Alan]]ic mother,<ref>''Historia Augusta'', \"Life of Maximinus\", 1.5.</ref>\n\nSecondly, soon after the appearance of the Alamanni, on the [[Upper Rhine]], the [[Franks]] begin to be mentioned on the bend of the lower Rhine. In this case, the collective name was new, but the original tribes who composed the group were largely local, and their old names were still sometimes mentioned.

However, the ability to handle the barbarians in the old way broke down in the late 4th century and the western part of the empire itself broke down. In addition to the Franks on the Rhine frontier, and Suevian peoples such as the Alamanni, the eastern Germanic-speaking \"Gothic peoples\" now played an increasing role both inside and outside imperial territory.\n====Gothic entry into the empire====\n{{Main|Gothic War (376\u2013382)}}\nThe Gothic wars of the late 4th century, were in some ways similar to the biggest border conflicts of the past, but saw the defeat of a major Roman army and killing of emperor [[Valens]] at the [[Battle of Adrianopolis]] (378). While the eastern empire eventually recovered, the subsequent long reigning western emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] (reigned 393-423) was unable to impose imperial authority over much of the empire, for most of his reign.<ref>{{harvtxt|Halsall|2007|pp=234-237}}</ref> In contrast to the eastern empire, in the west the \"attempts of its ruling class to use the Roman-barbarian kings to preserve the [[res publica]] failed\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=103}}\n\nThe Gothic wars were affected indirectly by the arrival of the nomadic [[Huns]] from Central Asia into the Ukrainian region. Some Gothic peoples, such as the [[Gepids]] and the [[Greuthungi]] (sometimes seen as predecessors of the later [[Ostrogoths]]), joined the newly forming Hunnish faction, and played a prominent role in the Hunnic Empire, where Gothic became a [[lingua franca]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=142}} Based on the description of [[Socrates Scholasticus]], Guy Halsall has argued that the Hunnish hegemony developed after a major campaign by Valens against the Goths, which had caused great damage, but failed to achieve a decisive victory.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=173}} Peter Heather has argued that Socrates should be rejected on this point, as inconsistent with the testimony of [[Ammianus]].{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=160}}\n\nIn contrast, the Gothic [[Thervingi]] had borne the impact of the campaign of Valens, under the leadership of [[Athanaric]], and were losers against the Huns, but clients of Rome. A new faction under leadership of [[Fritigern]], a christian, were given asylum inside the Roman Empire in 376 CE. They crossed the Danube and became ''[[foederati]]''.{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=594}} With the emperor occupied in the Middle East, the Tervingi were treated badly, becoming desperate, and significant numbers of mounted Greuthungi, [[Alans]] and others were able to cross the river and support a Tervingian uprising leading to the massive Roman defeat at Adrianople.<ref>{{harvtxt|Halsall|2007|pp=176-178}}; {{harvtxt|Wolfram|1997|pp=79-87}}.</ref>\n\nAround 383, the Romans and the Goths now within the empire came to agreements about the terms under which the Goths should live. There is debate about the exact nature of such agreements, and for example whether it allowed the continuous semi-independent existence of pre-existing peoples, however the Goths do appear to have been allowed more privileges than traditional settlements with such outside groups.<ref>Contrast {{harvtxt|Halsall|2007|pp=180-185}} and {{harvtxt|Heather|2009|pp=189-196}}.</ref> One result of the large settlement was that the imperial army now had a large number of Goths, including Gothic generals.<ref>{{harvtxt|Halsall|2007|pp=183-185}}; {{harvtxt|Heather|2009|p=194}}; {{harvtxt|Wolfram|1997|p=110}}.</ref>\n\n====Imperial turmoil====\nBy 383 a new emperor, [[Theodosius I]], was seen as victorious over the Goths and having the situation back under control. Goths were a prominent but resented part of the eastern military. The Greutungi and Alans had been settled in [[Pannonia]] by the western co-emperor [[Gratian]] (assassinated in 383) who was himself a Pannonian. Theodosius died 395, and was succeeded by his sons: [[Arcadius]] in the east, and Honorius, who was still a minor, in the west. The Western empire had however become destabilized since 383, with several young emperors including Gratian having previously been murdered. Court factions and military leaders in the east and west attempted to control the situation.\n\n[[Alaric I|Alaric]] was a Roman military commander of Gothic background, who first appears in the record in the time of Theodosius. He became one of the various Roman competitors for influence and power in the difficult situation. The forces he led were described as mixed barbarian forces, and clearly included many other people of Gothic background, which had become common in the eastern empire. In an important turning point for Roman history, during the factional turmoil, his army came to act increasingly as an independent political entity within the Roman empire, and he eventually came to be referred to as their king, probably around 401 CE, when he lost his official Roman title.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=206,217}} This is the origin of the [[Visigoths]], who the empire later allowed to settle in what is now southwestern France. While military units had often had their own ethnic history and symbolism, this is the first time that such a group became a new kingdom. There is disagreement about whether Alaric or his family had a royal background, but there is no doubt that this kingdom was a new entity, very different from any previous Gothic kingdoms.\n\n====Invasions of 401\u2013411====\n{{Main|Crossing of the Rhine|Radagaisus}}\nIn the aftermath of the large scale Gothic entries into the empire, the Germanic Rhine groups, the Franks and Alemanni, became more secure in their positions in 395, when [[Stilicho]] made agreements with them so that he could withdraw the imperial forces from their Rhine frontier in order to use them in his conflicts with Alaric and the Eastern empire.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=199}}\n\nOn the Danube, change was far more dramatic. In the words of Walter Goffart:\n:Between 401 and 411, four distinct groups of barbarians - different from Alaric's Goths - invaded Roman territory, all apparently on one-way journeys, in large-scale efforts to transpose themselves onto imperial soil and not just plunder and return home.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=94}}\n\nThe reasons that these invasions apparently all dispersed from the same area, the Middle Danube, are uncertain. It is most often argued that the Huns must have already started moving west, and pressuring the Middle Danube. Peter Heather for example writes that around 400, \"a highly explosive situation was building up in the Middle Danube, as Goths, Vandals, Alans and other refugees from the Huns moved west of the Carpathians\" into the area of modern Hungary on the Roman frontier.{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=182-183,197}}\n\nWalter Goffart, in contrast, has pointed out that there is no clear evidence of new eastern groups arriving in the area immediately before the great movements, and so it remains possible that the Huns moved West after these large groups had left the Middle Danube. Goffart's suggestion is that the example of the Goths, such as those led by Alaric, had set an example leading to a \"common perception that warriors could improve their condition by forcing their existence on the attention of the Empire\".{{sfn|Goffart|2006|loc=ch.5}}\n\nWhatever the chain of events, the Middle Danube later became the centre of Attila's loose empire containing many East Germanic people from the east, who remained there after the death of Attila. The make-up of peoples in that area, previously the home of the Germanic Marcomanni, Quadi and non-Germanic Iazyges, changed completely in ways which had a significant impact on the Roman empire and its European neighbours. In the future, though the new peoples ruling this area still included Germanic-speakers, as discussed above, they were not described by Romans as ''Germani'', but rather \"Gothic peoples\".\n\n*In 401, [[Claudian]] mentions a Roman victory over a large force including Vandals, in the province of Ra\u00ebtia. It is possible that this group was involved in the later crossing of the Rhine.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|pp=88-89}}\n*In 405-406, [[Radagaisus]] who was probably Gothic, entered the empire on the Middle Danube with a very large force of unclearly defined, but apparently Gothic, composition, and succeeded to invade Italy.{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=182}} He was captured and killed in 406 near Florence and 12000 of his men recruited into Roman forces.\n*A more successful invasion apparently also originating from the Middle Danube, reached the Rhine a few months later. As described by Halsall: \"On 31 December 405 a huge body from the interior of Germania crossed the Rhine: Siling and Hasding Vandals, Sueves and Alans. [...] The Franks in the area fought back furiously and even killed the Vandal king. Significantly no source mentions any defense by Roman troops.\"{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=211}} The composition of this group of barbarians, who were not all Germanic-speaking, indicates that they had traveled from the area north of the [[Middle Danube]]. (The Suebians involved may well have included remnants of the once powerful Marcomanni and Quadi.) The non-Germanic Alans were the largest group, and one part of them under [[King Goar]] settled with Roman agreement in Gaul, while the rest of these peoples entered Roman Iberia in 409 and established kingdoms there, and some traveled further to establish the Vandal kingdom of North Africa.\n*In 411 a Burgundian group established themselves in northern [[Germania Superior]] on the Rhine, between Franks and Alamanni, holding the cities of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Speyer]], and [[Strassburg]]. They and a group of Alans helped establish yet another short-lived claimant to the throne, [[Jovinus]], who was eventually defeated by the Visigoths cooperating with Honorius.\n\nMotivated by the ensuing chaos in Gaul, in 406 the Roman army in Britain elected [[Constantine III (Western Roman Emperor)|Constantine \"III\"]] as emperor and they took control there.\n\nIn 408, the eastern emperor Arcadius died, leaving a child as successor, and the west Roman military leader [[Stilicho]] was killed. Alaric, wanting a formal Roman command but unable to negotiate one, invaded Rome itself, twice, in 401 and 408.\n\n[[Constantius III]], who became ''[[Magister militum]]'' by 411, restored order step-by-step, eventually allowing the Visigoths to settle within the empire in southwest Gaul. He also committed to re-taking control of Iberia, from the Rhine-crossing groups. When Constantius died in 421, having been co-emperor himself for one year, Honorius was the only emperor in the West. However, Honorius died in 423 without heir. After this, the Western Roman empire steadily lost control of its provinces.\n\n==== From Western Roman Empire to medieval kingdoms (420\u2013568) ====\n{{Further|Decline of the Western Roman Empire|Barbarian kingdoms}}\n[[File:Europe and the Near East at 476 AD.png|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Germania|Germanic]] kingdoms and tribes after the end of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in 476 CE]]\n[[File:Odovacar Ravenna 477.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Coin of [[Odoacer]], Ravenna, 477, with Odoacer in profile, depicted with a \"barbarian\" [[moustache]].]]\n[[File:Germanic kingdoms 526CE.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Germanic kingdoms in 526 CE]]\n[[File:Invasions of the Roman Empire 1.png|thumb|upright=1.5|2nd century to 6th century simplified migrations]]\nThe Western Roman Empire declined over several steps in the 5th and 6th centuries, and the eastern emperors only had limited control over events in Italy and the western empire. Germanic speakers who by now dominated the Roman military in Europe, and lived both inside and outside the empire, played many roles in this complex dynamic. Notably, as the old territory of the western empire came to be ruled on a regional basis, the barbarian military forces, ruled now by kings, took over administration with differing levels of success. With some exceptions, such as the [[Alans]] and [[Bretons]], most of these new political entities identified themselves with a Germanic-speaking heritage.\n\nIn the 420s, [[Flavius A\u00ebtius]] was a general who successfully used Hunnish forces on several occasions, fighting Roman factions, and various barbarians including Goths and Franks. In 429 he was elevated to the rank of ''magister militum'' in the western empire, putting him in control of much of its policy. One of his first conflicts was with [[Bonifacius|Boniface]], a rebellious governor of the province of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]] in modern Tunisia and Libya. Both sides sought an alliance with the Vandals based in southern Spain who had acquired a fleet there. In this context, the [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandal and Alan kingdom]] of North Africa and the western Mediterranean would come into being.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=240}}\n*In 433 A\u00ebtius was in exile and spent time in the Hunnish domain.\n*In 434, the Vandals were granted the control of some parts of northwest Africa, but A\u00ebtius defeated Boniface using Hunnish forces.\n*In 436 A\u00ebtius defeated the Burgundians on the Rhine with the help of Hunnish forces.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=244}}\n*In 439 the Vandals and their allies captured Carthage. The Romans made a new agreement recognizing the Visigothic kingdom.\n*In 440, the Hunnish \"empire\" as it can now be called, under [[Attila]] and his brother Bleda began a series of attacks over the Danube into the eastern empire, and Danubian part of the western empire. They received enormous payments from the eastern empire and then focused their attentions to the west, where they were already familiar with the situation, and in friendly contact with the African Vandals.\n*In 442 A\u00ebtius seems to have granted the Alans who had remained in Gaul a kingdom, apparently including [[Orl\u00e9ans]], possibly to counter local independent Roman groups (so called [[Bagaudae]], who also competed for power in Iberia).\n*In 443 A\u00ebtius settled the Burgundians from the Rhine deeper in the empire, in Savoy in Gaul.\n*In 451, the large mixed force of Attila crossed the Rhine but was defeated by Aetius with forces from the settled barbarians in Gaul - Visigoths, Franks, Burgundians and Alans.\n*In 452 Attila attacked Italy, but had to retreat to the Middle Danube because of disease.\n*In 453, A\u00ebtius and Attila both died.\n*In 454, the Hunnish alliance divided and fought the [[Battle of Nedao]]. The original names of the peoples in the alliance appear again. Several of them were allowed to become federates of the eastern empire in the Balkans, and others created kingdoms in the Middle Danube.\n\nIn the subsequent decades, the Franks and Alamanni tended to remain in small kingdoms but these began to extend deeper into the empire. In northern Gaul, a Roman military \"King of Franks\" also seems to have existed, [[Childeric I]], whose successor [[Clovis I]] established dominance of the smaller kingdoms of the Franks and Alamanni, who they defeated at the [[Battle of Tolbiac|Battle of Z\u00fclpich]] in 496. \n\nCompared to Gaul, what happened in [[Roman Britain]], which was similarly both isolated from Italy and heavily Romanized, is less clearly recorded. However the end result was similar, with a Germanic-speaking military class, the [[Anglo-Saxons]], taking over administration of what remained of Roman society, and conflict between an unknown number of regional powers. While major parts of Gaul and Britain redefined themselves ethnically on the basis of their new rulers, as [[West Francia|Francia]] and [[England]], in England the main population also became Germanic speaking. The exact reasons for the difference are uncertain, but significant levels of migration played a role.{{sfn|Halsall|2013}}\n\nIn 476 [[Odoacer]], a Roman soldier who came from the tribes of the Middle Danube in the aftermath of Nedao, became King of Italy, removing the last western emperors from power. He was murdered and replaced in 493 by [[Theoderic the Great]], described as [[King of the Ostrogoths]], one of the most powerful Middle Danube peoples of the old Hun alliance. Theoderic had been raised up and supported by the eastern emperors, and his administration continued a sophisticated Roman administration, in cooperation with the traditional [[Roman senate|Roman senatorial]] class. Similarly, Roman lifestyles continued in North Africa under the Vandals, Savoy under the Burgundians, and within the Visigothic realm.\n\nThe Ostrogothic kingdom ended in 542 when the eastern emperor [[Justinian]] made a last great effort to reconquer the [[Western Mediterranean]]. The conflicts destroyed the Italian senatorial class.{{sfn|Geary|2002|p=113}} The eastern empire was also unable to hold Italy for long, and in 568 the [[Lombards|Lombard]] king [[Alboin]], a Suebian people who had entered the Middle Danubian region from the north conquering and partly absorbing the frontier peoples there, entered Italy and created the Italian [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] there. These Lombards now included Suevi, [[Heruli]], [[Gepids]], [[Bavarians]], Bulgars, Avars, Saxons, Goths, and [[Thuringians]]. As Peter Heather has written these \"peoples\" were no longer peoples in any traditional sense.<ref>{{harvtxt|Heather|2009|p=240}}, citing [[Paul the Deacon]].</ref>\n\nOlder accounts which describe a long period of massive movements of peoples and military invasions are over-simplified, and only describe specific incidents. According to [[Herwig Wolfram]], the Germanic peoples did not and could not \"conquer the more advanced Roman world\" nor were they able to \"restore it as a political and economic entity\"; instead, he asserts that the empire's \"universalism\" was replaced by \"tribal particularism\" which gave way to \"regional patriotism\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=308}} The Germanic peoples who overran the Western Roman Empire probably numbered less than 100,000 people per tribe, including approximately 15,000-20,000 warriors. They constituted a tiny minority of the population in the lands over which they seized control.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Wolfram|1997|p=7}}: \"[T]hese tribes were surprisingly small: fifteen to twenty thousand warriors\u2014which means a total of about one hundred thousand people in a tribe\u2014was the maximum number a large people could raise... These people are likewise presented as conquerors of the Roman Empire, even though they constituted a vanishing minority within it.\"}}\n\nApart from the common history many of them had in the Roman military, and on Roman frontiers, a new and longer-term unifying factor for the new kingdoms was that by 500, the start of the [[Middle Ages]], most of the old Western empire had converted to the same Rome-based [[Catholicism|Catholic]] form of [[Christianity]]. A key turning point was the conversion of Clovis I in 508. Before this point, many of the Germanic kingdoms, such as the Goths and Burgundians, were [[Arianism|Arian]] Christians - a form of Christianity which they perhaps took up in the time of the Arian emperor [[Valens]], but which was now considered a heresy.\n\n===Early Middle Ages===\n{{Main|Early Middle Ages}}\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Franks expansion.gif|thumb|upright=1.15|Frankish expansion from the early kingdom of [[Clovis I]] (481) to the divisions of [[Carolingian Empire|Charlemagne's Empire]] (843/870)]]\n[[File:Viking Expansion.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Map showing area of [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlements during the [[Viking Age]], including [[Normans|Norman]] conquests]]\nIn the centuries after 568, the [[Visigothic kingdom]], by now centred in Spain, was ended by the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] in the 8th century. Much of continental catholic Europe became part of a greater [[Francia]] under the [[Merovingian]] and then the [[Carolingian dynasty]], which began with [[Pepin the Short]], the son of [[Charles Martel]]. Charles, though not a king, reconsolidated the Frankish kingdom's dominance over Saxons, Frisians, Bavarians and Burgundians, and defeated the Umayyads at the 732 [[Battle of Tours]]. Pepin's son [[Charlemagne]] conquered the Lombards in 774, and in an important turning point in European history, was crowned as emperor by [[Pope Leo III]] in Rome on Christmas Day, 800 CE. This consolidated a shift in the power structure from the south to the north, and was also a strong symbolic link to Rome and the Roman Christianity. The core of the new empire included what is now France, Germany and the [[Benelux]] countries. The empire laid the foundations for the medieval and early modern ''[[ancien regime]]'', finally destroyed only by the [[French Revolution]]. The Frankish-Catholic way of doing politics and war and religion also had a strong effect upon all neighbouring regions, including what became England, Spain, Italy, Austria, and Bohemia.\n\nThe effect of old Germanic culture on this new Latin-using empire is a topic of dispute, because there was much continuity with the old Roman legal systems, and the increasingly important Christian religion. An example which is argued to show an influence of earlier Germanic culture is law. The new kingdoms created new law codes in Latin, with occasional Germanic words.{{sfn|Liebeschuetz|2015|p=97}} These were Roman-influenced, and under strong church influence all law was increasingly standardized to accord with Christian philosophy, and old Roman law.{{sfn|Geary|2002|pp=123-128,137-138}}\n\nGermanic languages in western Europe also faded out of use in most areas apart from the West Germanic group of related languages including England, the \"[[Austrasia]]n\" Frankish homelands near the Lower Rhine, Maas and Scheldt rivers, and the large area between the Rhine and Elbe. With the splitting off of this latter area within the Frankish empire, the first ever political entity corresponding loosely to modern \"Germany\" came into existence.\n\nIn [[Eastern Europe]] the once relatively developed periphery of the Roman world collapsed culturally and economically, and this can be seen in the Germanic-associated archaeological evidence: in the area of today's southern Poland and Ukraine the collapse was not long after 400, and by 700 Germanic material culture was entirely west of the Elbe in the area where the Romans had been active since Caesar's time, and the Franks were now active. East of the Elbe was to become mainly [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] speaking.{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=371-372}}\n\nOutside of the Roman-influenced zone, Germanic-speaking Scandinavia was in the [[Vendel period]] and eventually entered the [[Viking Age]], with [[Viking expansion|expansion]] to [[Danelaw|Britain]], Ireland and [[history of Iceland|Iceland]] in the west and as far as [[Rus Khaganate|Russia]] and [[Varangians|Greece]] in the east.<ref>{{harvtxt|Derry|2012|pp=16\u201335}}; {{harvtxt|Clements|2005|pp=214\u2013229}}; {{harvtxt|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=310}}</ref> Swedish Vikings, known locally as the [[Rus' people|Rus']], ventured deep into Russia, where they founded the political entities of [[Kievan Rus']].

On the other hand, the Scandinavian countries were, starting with Denmark, under the influence of Germany to their south, and also the lands where they had colonies. Bit by bit they became Christian, and organized themselves into Frankish- and Catholic-influenced kingdoms.\n\n[[File:Holy Roman Empire 11th century map-en.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Kingdom of Germany]] (''Regnum Teutonicum'') within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], circa 1000 AD]]\n\n==Roman descriptions of early Germanic people and culture==\n{{See|Germanic culture|Early Germanic culture}}\nCaesar and Tacitus gave colorful descriptions of the Germanic peoples, but scholars note that these need to be viewed cautiously. For one thing, many of the tropes used, such as concerning the red or blond hair, the blue eyes, and the undisciplined emotions of the Germanic peoples, were old ones that had long been used for any northern peoples such as Gauls. Secondly, the Germanic descriptions of both authors are recognized as having been intended to be both critical of Roman moral softness, and pushing for specific foreign policies.\n\nTacitus famously described the Germanic people as ethnically \"unmixed\", which had an influence on pre-1945 German racist nationalism. It was not necessarily meant to be purely positive:\n:For my own part, I agree with those who think that the tribes of Germany are free from all taint of inter-marriages with foreign nations, and that they appear as a distinct, unmixed race, like none but themselves. Hence, too, the same physical peculiarities throughout so vast a population. All have fierce blue eyes, red hair, huge frames, fit only for a sudden exertion. They are less able to bear laborious work. Heat and thirst they cannot in the least endure; to cold and hunger their climate and their soil inure them.<ref name=tac4>{{harvtxt|Tacitus|2009|p=39}} ''Germania'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:4 4].</ref>\n\nModern scholars point out that one way of interpreting such remarks is that it is consistent with other comments by Tacitus indicating that the Germanic people lived very remotely, in unattractive countries, for example in the next part of the text:\n:Their country, though somewhat various in appearance, yet generally either bristles with forests or reeks with swamps; it is more rainy on the side of Gaul, bleaker on that of Noricum and Pannonia. It is productive of grain, but unfavourable to fruit-bearing trees; it is rich in flocks and herds, but these are for the most part undersized, and even the cattle have not their usual beauty or noble head. <ref name=tac5>{{harvtxt|Tacitus|2009|p=39}} ''Germania'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1351.phi002.perseus-eng1:5 5].</ref>\n\nArchaeological research has revealed that the early Germanic peoples were primarily agricultural, although husbandry and fishing were important sources of livelihood depending on the nature of the environment.{{sfn|Owen|1960|pp=166-174}} They carried out extensive trade with their neighbours, notably exporting amber, slaves, mercenaries and animal hides, and importing weapons, metals, glassware and coins in return.{{sfn|Owen|1960|pp=174-178}} They eventually came to excel at craftsmanship, particularly metalworking.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=23}} In many cases in fact, ancient Germanic smiths and other craftsmen produced products of higher quality than the Romans.{{Efn|\"Some smiths were able to rework iron into high-quality steel and make sword blades with a core of softer steel for flexibility and harder steel on the exterior to keep a sharp edge, far finer weapons than those used in the Roman army at the time.\"{{harvtxt|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=324}} \"Furthermore, the skills of Germanic smiths and other craftsmen were as good as, or better than those found inside the Roman empire.\"{{harvtxt|MacDowall|2000|p=16}} }}\n\nBefore Tacitus, Julius Caesar described the ''Germani'' and their customs in his ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', though in certain cases it is still a matter of debate if he refers to Northern [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes or clearly identified Germanic tribes. Caesar notes that the Gauls had earlier dominated and sent colonies into the lands of the Germans, but that the Gauls had since degenerated under the influence of Roman civilization, and now considered themselves inferior in military prowess.{{Efn|{{harvtxt|Caesar|2019|pp=156, 6.24}}: \"Proximity to our provinces and familiarity with seaborne imports bring the Gauls many things to use and keep, so they gradually grew accustomed to defeat, losing many battles and not even claiming to be the Germans' equals in courage now.\" {{harvtxt|Caesar|2019|pp=29, 1.39}}: \"[O]ur men inquired and heard Gauls and merchants describing the Germans' huge bodies, their incredible strength, and their experience in arms. They had often encountered them and could not stand the sight of them or endure their gaze. Great fear suddenly seized our whole army...\".}}\n\n:[The Germani] have neither [[Druids]] to preside over sacred offices, nor do they pay great regard to sacrifices. They rank in the number of the gods those alone whom they behold, and by whose instrumentality they are obviously benefited, namely, the sun, fire, and the moon; they have not heard of the other deities even by report. Their whole life is occupied in hunting and in the pursuits of the military art; from childhood they devote themselves to fatigue and hardships. Those who have remained [[chaste]] for the longest time, receive the greatest commendation among their people; they think that by this the growth is promoted, by this the physical powers are increased and the sinews are strengthened.
