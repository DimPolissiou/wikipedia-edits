However, he returned to Saracens and was pivotal in the [[2010\u201311 Aviva Premiership]] Final, kicking five penalties and converting [[James Short (rugby union)|James Short]]'s try, ending with a personal haul of 17 points in the 22\u201318 victory over reigning champions Leicester Tigers.\n\nThe 2013\u201314 season was a strong season for Farrell and Saracens, with the London Club reaching the Heineken Cup against Toulon, but they missed out on the title after losing the match 23\u20136, and there was more disappointment for Farrell and Saracens after being defeated 24\u201320 in the Aviva Premiership Final against Northampton at Twickenham.

He finished the competition with 63 points from five games. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe [[2012 mid-year rugby test series|2012 summer tour]] of South Africa saw Farrell get selected again. He played all of the warm-up game against [[Barbarian F.C.|the Barbarians]] and scored a respectable 17 points in a game that England won comfortably. Farrell again played all through the first match against [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]], where England lost 22\u201317 in a tight game. He kicked all four of his penalties but missed a conversion. He came on as a substitute in the second test; he scored no points and could not help England avoid defeat for a second time. Farrell had two spells on the pitch in the third test; he scored two penalties in a tight game that ended 14\u201314, twice attempting to score his first drop goal but missing each time. He ended the series with 18 points from three appearances. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nFarrell played his first game in the autumn test series as a substitute and scored a conversion.\nOn 1 December 2012, he started in England's game against [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] and scored a total of 17 points in helping England to a record-breaking victory; it was their greatest-ever margin of victory over the All Blacks. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nHe was nominated for [[International Rugby Board|IRB]] Player of the Year, but lost out to the New Zealand stand-off [[Dan Carter]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nFarrell started in the [[Calcutta Cup]] match against Scotland, only missing one kick in a near-faultless display.

He went on to start in England's first World Cup warm-up match on 15 August, against France, scoring two out of three conversions and consequently helping England win the game 19\u201314. Farrell was picked by Lancaster as one of two fly-halves in the 31-man World Cup squad.\n\nFarrell came on as a replacement for [[George Ford (rugby union)|George Ford]] in the opening match of the world cup against [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]], a 35\u201311 win where Farrell did not miss any kicks. Farrell played for the full 80 minutes in England's second 2015 World Cup match, a 25\u201328 loss to Wales, scoring 20 points after failing to miss any kicks for the second straight match. He subsequently kept his place to face Australia the following weekend, on 2 October 2015, which England went on to lose 13\u201333 after Farrell was sin-binned in the 70th minute. This was the first time that England failed to make the playoffs of a Rugby World Cup, having lost to both Wales and Australia now. Farrell started at inside centre in England's final pool match, a 60\u20133 win over Uruguay. Farrell was subbed off for [[Jonathan Joseph (rugby union)|Jonathan Joseph]] in the 59th minute after missing two of his six kicks.\n\nIn January 2016, after his fine displays for Saracens, Farrell was selected in the first squad of new England head coach [[Eddie Jones (rugby union)|Eddie Jones]]. With injuries to [[Henry Slade]] and [[Manu Tuilagi]] leaving few choices at inside centre, Farrell was selected at 12 in Jones' first two matches, away to Scotland and Italy respectively. [[George Ford (rugby union)|George Ford]] became a regular starter at 10 in Farrell's place. He was selected as one of England's vice-captains for the Six Nations, along with [[Mike Brown (rugby union)|Mike Brown]] and [[Billy Vunipola]], under [[Dylan Hartley]]'s captaincy. In the first two matches, Farrell contributed 22 points including a try against Italy, and assumed the captaincy when Hartley was substituted late on.\n\nFarrell went on to start at inside centre in all five of England's games during the Six Nations tournament, winning his first major international trophy as part of England's Grand Slam-winning side. Farrell finished the tournament as the leading scorer with 69 points, bringing his personal tally for England to 412 and making him the second-highest points scorer in the history of the England national team, with only [[Jonny Wilkinson]] having scored more.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, England embarked on a three-match series in Australia. Farrell was initially picked to start at fly-half for the first test, however, he was soon reverted to inside centre with Ford assuming the No.10 shirt. England would go on to win the series 3\u20130, with Farrell playing a pivotal role, being named man of the match in the third test and scoring 66 points on tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2016/06/25/owen-farrell-praises-jonny-wilkinsons-kicking-tuition-after-star/|title=Owen Farrell praises Jonny Wilkinson's kicking tuition after star turn in England's series win over Australia|access-date=2016-07-18}}</ref>\nOwen was nominated for the six-man shortlist for the 2016 World Player of the Year Award for the second time in his career, alongside his Saracens teammates Billy Vunipola and [[Maro Itoje]].\n\n====2017\u20132018====\nFarrell played all 80 minutes every test in the 2017 [[Six Nations Championship]] and helped [[England Rugby|England]] retaining the Six Nations title despite missing out the Grand Slam after losing the final game to Ireland. The highlight of Farrell's 2017 Six Nations was on 11 March 2017 when he scored 26 points against Scotland in a 61\u201321 win for England.\n\nFarrell had a huge workload in the [[2018 Six Nations Championship]] and played in every minute of the competition. Farrell scored a try against Italy on 4 February 2018 and also set one up for first-five George Ford. Disappointingly however, Farrell only kicked 5/8 of his goals against Italy, which disallowed England from putting 50 points on Italy, leaving England to win 46\u201315. On 24 February, Farrell scored all of England's points against Scotland, including a try. This was not enough however, with Farrell's second try of the match disallowed. Scotland went on to upset England 25\u201313, with Farrell's game not doing enough to get England a win.\n\nOn 10 March 2018, Farrell captained England for the first time in his career when they faced France in [[Stade de France]] in Paris. Farrell did not miss any kicks against France in the match and defended well, but England lost 22\u201316 due to giving away penalties to French scrum-half [[Maxime Machenaud]] who managed to convert them into points. Farrell later admitted to media that England's lack of discipline cost them the test.\n\nEngland went onto lose their final 6 Nations match against Ireland, with Hartley back as captain. Farrell started the match at fly-half, with George Ford dropping to the bench, his first start in the ten jersey for England since June 2016.\n\n====2018-2019 and the captaincy====\n{{Unreferencedsect|date=January 2020}}\nAfter England captain [[Dylan Hartley]] sustained another concussion in 2018 and was subsequently ruled out of England's three-test series against South Africa, Farrell was promoted to captain in Hartley's absence, leading England to a 2\u20131 series defeat. Although England rushed to a 24\u20133 lead early in the first test, with Farrell scoring a try, South Africa came back into the test eventually winning 42\u201339. England won the final test 25\u201310 for Farrell's first victory as England captain. Farrell returned to 12 for the series, with Ford back at 10 for the first two games, which England lost, before Danny Cipriani was installed at 10 for the final game.\n\nDuring the autumn, Dylan Hartley again returned from injury, but Farrell was selected as co-captain. The pair led England to victories over South Africa (12-11) and Australia (37-20), and a defeat to New Zealand (16-15), while Farrell came off the bench during a 35\u201315 victory over Japan (George Ford captained this game). For the three matches he started, Farrell started at 10 again, with Ben Te\u2019o preferred at 12 outside him.\n\nFarrell was retained at 10 and as the sole England Captain during the 2019 6 Nations, with Hartley missing the whole tournament.\n\nEngland started the tournament with a shock 32\u201320 victory against the Irish in Dublin, avenging the previous year's loss for their first away win against the Irish since 2013, and only their third ever during the 6 Nations era. It was also Ireland's first home defeat since New Zealand beat them in November 2016, and Ireland went into the match having lost only one of their last eighteen games. The game was cited as England's best under Eddie Jones, and was backed up with a 44\u20138 win over France at Twickenham, their largest win in over 90 years against the French, with Farrell picking up a try as well as 12 points from the boot.\n\nDespite leading 10\u20133 at half time, in England's third match they came up short against Wales in Cardiff, losing 21\u201313 to the eventual 2019 Grand Slam winners.\n\nTheir final two matches saw a 57\u201314 victory over Italy before their final match against Scotland, both games at home. England scored 24 tries across the tournament, the most of any team since England scored 29 in 2001. Farrell contributed 59 points to this, finishing the 2019 tournaments top scorer. However, their final match against Scotland ended in a 38 all draw, with England leading 31\u20137 at the break before Scotland made a magnificent comeback to lead 38\u201331 by the 80th minute. Farrell was substituted with ten minutes left, and it was his replacement, George Ford, who proved the saviour for England to score after the clock had gone red to rescue the match for a draw. It was Scotland's first draw at Twickenham since 1989, and the first time they had retained the Calcutta Cup since 1984.\n\nFarrell was selected as England's captain for 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan, where England would face France, Argentina, Tonga and the United States in Pool C. He also started and captained two of England's four warm-up matches, starting at 12 against Ireland in a record 57\u201315 victory, and at 10 against Italy in England's first ever match at St James\u2019 Park in Newcastle\n\nEngland performed well at the 2019 World Cup, topping their pool with big wins over Argentina, Tonga and the USA (their match against France was cancelled due to a typhoon), and following this up with a record equalling win over Australia in the Quarter-Final. Farrell went on to lead England to victory over New Zealand in the semi final, winning 19\u20137. Farrell captained England against South Africa in the Final, South Africa upset the favourites for the game and won 32\u201312.\n\nThe Semi-Final win against New Zealand made Farrell just the fourth England Captain (after Martin Johnson, Jeff Pullin and Will Carling) to lead England to victories against all of the \u201cBig Three\u201d Southern Hemisphere sides (South Africa, New Zealand and Australia). As captain, he has 2 wins against Australia, 2 against South Africa, and one against New Zealand.\n\n===British and Irish Lions===\nFarrell was selected as part of the [[British and Irish Lions]] squad for the [[2013 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia|2013 tour to Australia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/22352825|title=Lions 2013: Jonny Wilkinson out but Sam Warburton is captain|date=30 April 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Farrell started for the Lions in Hong Kong on 1 June against the Barbarians, kicking three penalties and three conversions in a convincing 59\u20138 win for the Lions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/22732236|title=Barbarians 8\u201359 Lions|date=1 June 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\nIn his second game against [[Western Force]], Farrell started on the bench, came on in the 66th minute and scored a try with his first touch, helping the Lions towards a 69\u201317 win.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/22773458|title=Lions 2013: Healy injury mars nine-try win over Western Forces|date=5 June 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> He gained his first Lions test cap, coming off the bench to replace [[Jonathan Sexton]], in the 16\u201341 series decider.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/23210389|title=British and Irish Lions thrash Australia to seal series win|date=6 July 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2017, Farrell was named again as part of the Lions squad for the [[2017 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand|tour to New Zealand]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/39639299|title=British and Irish Lions 2017: Sam Warburton captain, Dylan Hartley out|date=19 April 2017|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> He played a pivotal role in the series, starting in all three tests against the All Blacks.

Farrell was picked by Lancaster as one of two fly-halves in the 31-man World Cup squad.\n\nFarrell came on as a replacement for [[George Ford (rugby union)|George Ford]] in the opening match of the world cup against [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]], a 35\u201311 win where Farrell did not miss any kicks. Farrell played for the full 80 minutes in England's second 2015 World Cup match, a 25\u201328 loss to Wales, scoring 20 points after failing to miss any kicks for the second straight match.

This was the first time that England failed to make the playoffs of a Rugby World Cup, having lost to both Wales and Australia now.

[[George Ford (rugby union)|George Ford]] became a regular starter at 10 in Farrell's place. He was selected as one of England's vice-captains for the Six Nations, along with [[Mike Brown (rugby union)|Mike Brown]] and [[Billy Vunipola]], under [[Dylan Hartley]]'s captaincy. In the first two matches, Farrell contributed 22 points including a try against Italy, and assumed the captaincy when Hartley was substituted late on.\n\nFarrell went on to start at inside centre in all five of England's games during the Six Nations tournament, winning his first major international trophy as part of England's Grand Slam-winning side. Farrell finished the tournament as the leading scorer with 69 points, bringing his personal tally for England to 412 and making him the second-highest points scorer in the history of the England national team, with only [[Jonny Wilkinson]] having scored more.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, England embarked on a three-match series in Australia. Farrell was initially picked to start at fly-half for the first test, however, he was soon reverted to inside centre with Ford assuming the No.10 shirt. England would go on to win the series 3\u20130, with Farrell playing a pivotal role, being named man of the match in the third test and scoring 66 points on tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2016/06/25/owen-farrell-praises-jonny-wilkinsons-kicking-tuition-after-star/|title=Owen Farrell praises Jonny Wilkinson's kicking tuition after star turn in England's series win over Australia|access-date=2016-07-18}}</ref>\nOwen was nominated for the six-man shortlist for the 2016 World Player of the Year Award for the second time in his career, alongside his Saracens teammates Billy Vunipola and [[Maro Itoje]].\n\n====2017\u20132018====\nFarrell played all 80 minutes every test in the 2017 [[Six Nations Championship]] and helped [[England Rugby|England]] retaining the Six Nations title despite missing out the Grand Slam after losing the final game to Ireland. The highlight of Farrell's 2017 Six Nations was on 11 March 2017 when he scored 26 points against Scotland in a 61\u201321 win for England.\n\nFarrell had a huge workload in the [[2018 Six Nations Championship]] and played in every minute of the competition. Farrell scored a try against Italy on 4 February 2018 and also set one up for first-five George Ford. Disappointingly however, Farrell only kicked 5/8 of his goals against Italy, which disallowed England from putting 50 points on Italy, leaving England to win 46\u201315. On 24 February, Farrell scored all of England's points against Scotland, including a try. This was not enough however, with Farrell's second try of the match disallowed. Scotland went on to upset England 25\u201313, with Farrell's game not doing enough to get England a win.\n\nOn 10 March 2018, Farrell captained England for the first time in his career when they faced France in [[Stade de France]] in Paris. Farrell did not miss any kicks against France in the match and defended well, but England lost 22\u201316 due to giving away penalties to French scrum-half [[Maxime Machenaud]] who managed to convert them into points. Farrell later admitted to media that England's lack of discipline cost them the test.\n\nEngland went onto lose their final 6 Nations match against Ireland, with Hartley back as captain. Farrell started the match at fly-half, with George Ford dropping to the bench, his first start in the ten jersey for England since June 2016.\n\n====2018-2019 and the captaincy====\n{{Unreferencedsect|date=January 2020}}\nAfter England captain [[Dylan Hartley]] sustained another concussion in 2018 and was subsequently ruled out of England's three-test series against South Africa, Farrell was promoted to captain in Hartley's absence, leading England to a 2\u20131 series defeat. Although England rushed to a 24\u20133 lead early in the first test, with Farrell scoring a try, South Africa came back into the test eventually winning 42\u201339. England won the final test 25\u201310 for Farrell's first victory as England captain. Farrell returned to 12 for the series, with Ford back at 10 for the first two games, which England lost, before Danny Cipriani was installed at 10 for the final game.\n\nDuring the autumn, Dylan Hartley again returned from injury, but Farrell was selected as co-captain. The pair led England to victories over South Africa (12-11) and Australia (37-20), and a defeat to New Zealand (16-15), while Farrell came off the bench during a 35\u201315 victory over Japan (George Ford captained this game). For the three matches he started, Farrell started at 10 again, with Ben Te\u2019o preferred at 12 outside him.\n\nFarrell was retained at 10 and as the sole England Captain during the 2019 6 Nations, with Hartley missing the whole tournament.\n\nEngland started the tournament with a shock 32\u201320 victory against the Irish in Dublin, avenging the previous year's loss for their first away win against the Irish since 2013, and only their third ever during the 6 Nations era. It was also Ireland's first home defeat since New Zealand beat them in November 2016, and Ireland went into the match having lost only one of their last eighteen games. The game was cited as England's best under Eddie Jones, and was backed up with a 44\u20138 win over France at Twickenham, their largest win in over 90 years against the French, with Farrell picking up a try as well as 12 points from the boot.\n\nDespite leading 10\u20133 at half time, in England's third match they came up short against Wales in Cardiff, losing 21\u201313 to the eventual 2019 Grand Slam winners.\n\nTheir final two matches saw a 57\u201314 victory over Italy before their final match against Scotland, both games at home. England scored 24 tries across the tournament, the most of any team since England scored 29 in 2001. Farrell contributed 59 points to this, finishing the 2019 tournaments top scorer. However, their final match against Scotland ended in a 38 all draw, with England leading 31\u20137 at the break before Scotland made a magnificent comeback to lead 38\u201331 by the 80th minute. Farrell was substituted with ten minutes left, and it was his replacement, George Ford, who proved the saviour for England to score after the clock had gone red to rescue the match for a draw. It was Scotland's first draw at Twickenham since 1989, and the first time they had retained the Calcutta Cup since 1984.\n\nFarrell was selected as England's captain for 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan, where England would face France, Argentina, Tonga and the United States in Pool C. He also started and captained two of England's four warm-up matches, starting at 12 against Ireland in a record 57\u201315 victory, and at 10 against Italy in England's first ever match at St James\u2019 Park in Newcastle\n\nEngland performed well at the 2019 World Cup, topping their pool with big wins over Argentina, Tonga and the USA (their match against France was cancelled due to a typhoon), and following this up with a record equalling win over Australia in the Quarter-Final. Farrell went on to lead England to victory over New Zealand in the semi final, winning 19\u20137. Farrell captained England against South Africa in the Final, South Africa upset the favourites for the game and won 32\u201312.\n\nThe Semi-Final win against New Zealand made Farrell just the fourth England Captain (after Martin Johnson, Jeff Pullin and Will Carling) to lead England to victories against all of the \u201cBig Three\u201d Southern Hemisphere sides (South Africa, New Zealand and Australia). As captain, he has 2 wins against Australia, 2 against South Africa, and one against New Zealand.\n\n===British and Irish Lions===\nFarrell was selected as part of the [[British and Irish Lions]] squad for the [[2013 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia|2013 tour to Australia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/22352825|title=Lions 2013: Jonny Wilkinson out but Sam Warburton is captain|date=30 April 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Farrell started for the Lions in Hong Kong on 1 June against the Barbarians, kicking three penalties and three conversions in a convincing 59\u20138 win for the Lions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/22732236|title=Barbarians 8\u201359 Lions|date=1 June 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\nIn his second game against [[Western Force]], Farrell started on the bench, came on in the 66th minute and scored a try with his first touch, helping the Lions towards a 69\u201317 win.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/22773458|title=Lions 2013: Healy injury mars nine-try win over Western Forces|date=5 June 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> He gained his first Lions test cap, coming off the bench to replace [[Jonathan Sexton]], in the 16\u201341 series decider.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/23210389|title=British and Irish Lions thrash Australia to seal series win|date=6 July 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2017, Farrell was named again as part of the Lions squad for the [[2017 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand|tour to New Zealand]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/39639299|title=British and Irish Lions 2017: Sam Warburton captain, Dylan Hartley out|date=19 April 2017|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> He played a pivotal role in the series, starting in all three tests against the All Blacks.

Studies on the compound eyes and chelicerae of ''Acutiramus'' has revealed that it would have had a comparably low visual acuity and claws adapted for slicing and shearing, rather than crushing. This suggests that the ecological role of ''Acutiramus'' was distinct from that of other pterygotids, it potentially lived a lifestyle of [[Ambush predator|ambush predation]] or [[scavenging]] on soft-bodied animals, feeding during the night or in otherwise low-light conditions.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=McCoy|first=Victoria E.|last2=Lamsdell|first2=James C.|last3=Poschmann|first3=Markus|last4=Anderson|first4=Ross P.|last5=Briggs|first5=Derek E.

The type specimen, the [[carapace]] of a young individual, was discovered in waterlime deposits of [[Upper Silurian]] age in Litchfield, New York. At virtually the same time, the type specimen of another species of ''Pterygotus'', ''P. osborni'', was described from the same locality, this specimen preserving the prosoma and four abdominal segments but not the carapace. Later more complete remains from the locality allowed the two species to be synonymized in 1912 by [[John Mason Clarke]] and [[Rudolf Ruedemann]] as the fossils of ''P. osborni'' proved identical to more complete remains referred to ''P. marcophthalmus''.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n''A. bohemicus'' was likewise first named as a species of ''Pterygotus'' in 1872 based on an incomplete coxa (L23505) from the [[P\u0159\u00eddol\u00ed Formation]], Upper Silurian in age. Since the discovery of that specimen, other fossils referred to ''A. bohemicus'' have yielded other parts of the body, including chelicerae, more coxae, segments of the appendages, genital appendages and incomplete [[metastoma]]s (a large plate that is part of the abdomen) and telsons.\n\nThe species that would eventually be designated as the type species of ''Acutiramus'', ''A. cummingsi'', was described as ''Pterygotus cummingsi'' in 1875,<ref name=\":12\" /> based on a fragmentary [[Arthropod coxa|coxa]] (the base of the leg, with which it attaches to the body) of the fourth walking leg discovered during quarrying operations in cement rock near [[Buffalo, New York]].<ref name=\":2\" />  Another species, ''P. buffaloensis'' would be named six years later based on an incomplete fourth walking leg with the coxa included. Clarke and Ruedemann synonymized these taxa in 1912, choosing ''P. buffaloensis'' as the name because they considered ''P. cummingsi'' to \"not be properly defined\".<ref name=\"genus\" />\n\nThe principal differences between ''A. cummingsi'' and other species of ''Acutiramus'' is in its telson. The telson of ''A. cummingsi'' is not as obovate (ovate with a narrow end at its base) or elongated as that of ''A. macrophthalmus'' (which possesses a telson that is six times as long as it is wide), the telson of ''A. cummingsi'' is most often just as long as it is wide.<ref name=\":2\" /> The shape of the metastoma of ''A. bohemicus'' has been compared to other species in the genus, especially to that of ''A. cummingsi'', which preserves a metastoma that is almost identical in morphology. ''A. bohemicus'' is generally agreed to be the species closest in relation to ''A. cummingsi'', though they are differentiated by characteristics in the dentition of the chelae, many of the teeth being larger in ''A. bohemicus''.

While it was obviously closely related to ''[[Pterygotus anglicus|P. anglicus]]'' based on features of the telson, the two species could easily be differentiated by several characteristics, notably the fishhook-like shape of the teeth of the chelae (claws) and the direction they pointed in being different.<ref name=\":2\" /> These features of the claw were noted as being similar to those of ''P. osiliensis'', a species with a highly distinct bilobed telson.<ref name=\":2\" /> Furthermore, Clarke and Ruedemann noted that ''P. macrophthalmus'' appeared to have a free ramus intermediate in shape between species of ''Pterygotus'' and ''A. cummingsi''.

The IOA is especially important as it can be used to distinguish different ecological roles in arthropods, being low in modern active arthropod predators.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn contrast to all other pterygotid genera, notably the very visually acute ''[[Pterygotus]]'' and ''[[Jaekelopterus]]'', the eyes of ''Acutiramus'' were low in visual acuity (with few lenses in the compound eyes and high IOA values), inconsistent with the traditionally assumed pterygotid lifestyle of \"active and high-level visual predators\".<ref name=\":1\" /> The IOA values of ''Acutiramus'' changed during ontogeny but in a way opposite to other pterygotids.

The type specimen, the [[carapace]] of a young individual, was discovered in waterlime deposits of [[Upper Silurian]] age in Litchfield, New York. At virtually the same time, the type specimen of another species of ''Pterygotus'', ''P. osborni'', was described from the same locality, this specimen preserving the prosoma and four abdominal segments but not the carapace. Later more complete remains from the locality allowed the two species to be synonymized in 1912 by [[John Mason Clarke]] and [[Rudolf Ruedemann]] as the fossils of ''P. osborni'' proved identical to more complete remains referred to ''P. marcophthalmus''.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n''A. bohemicus'' was likewise first named as a species of ''Pterygotus'' in 1872 based on an incomplete coxa (L23505) from the [[P\u0159\u00eddol\u00ed Formation]], Upper Silurian in age. Since the discovery of that specimen, other fossils referred to ''A. bohemicus'' have yielded other parts of the body, including chelicerae, more coxae, segments of the appendages, genital appendages and incomplete [[metastoma]]s (a large plate that is part of the abdomen) and telsons.\n\nThe species that would eventually be designated as the type species of ''Acutiramus'', ''A. cummingsi'', was described as ''Pterygotus cummingsi'' in 1875,<ref name=\":12\" /> based on a fragmentary [[Arthropod coxa|coxa]] (the base of the leg, with which it attaches to the body) of the fourth walking leg discovered during quarrying operations in cement rock near [[Buffalo, New York]].<ref name=\":2\" />  Another species, ''P. buffaloensis'' would be named six years later based on an incomplete fourth walking leg with the coxa included. Clarke and Ruedemann synonymized these taxa in 1912, choosing ''P. buffaloensis'' as the name because they considered ''P. cummingsi'' to \"not be properly defined\".<ref name=\"genus\" />\n\nThe principal differences between ''A. cummingsi'' and other species of ''Acutiramus'' is in its telson. The telson of ''A. cummingsi'' is not as obovate (ovate with a narrow end at its base) or elongated as that of ''A. macrophthalmus'' (which possesses a telson that is six times as long as it is wide), the telson of ''A. cummingsi'' is most often just as long as it is wide.<ref name=\":2\" /> The shape of the metastoma of ''A. bohemicus'' has been compared to other species in the genus, especially to that of ''A. cummingsi'', which preserves a metastoma that is almost identical in morphology. ''A. bohemicus'' is generally agreed to be the species closest in relation to ''A. cummingsi'', though they are differentiated by characteristics in the dentition of the chelae, many of the teeth being larger in ''A. bohemicus''.

While it was obviously closely related to ''[[Pterygotus anglicus|P. anglicus]]'' based on features of the telson, the two species could easily be differentiated by several characteristics, notably the fishhook-like shape of the teeth of the chelae (claws) and the direction they pointed in being different.<ref name=\":2\" /> These features of the claw were noted as being similar to those of ''P. osiliensis'', a species with a highly distinct bilobed telson.<ref name=\":2\" /> Furthermore, Clarke and Ruedemann noted that ''P. macrophthalmus'' appeared to have a free ramus intermediate in shape between species of ''Pterygotus'' and ''A. cummingsi''.

Overall, the morphology of the chelicerae of ''A. suwanneensis'' is thin and slender. Estimates of the total length of the species revealed that it would have been relatively small, measuring at most 45.7&nbsp;cm (18&nbsp;in) in length.

The type species of ''Bunodella'', NBMG 3000 (housed at the [[New Brunswick Museum]]), is incomplete and poorly preseved, but shows the characteristic ornamentation of the pterygotids composed of semilunate scales.

The primary method for determining visual acuity in arthropods is by determining the number of lenses in their [[compound eyes]] and the interommatidial angle (shortened as IOA and referring to the angle between the optical axes of the adjacent lenses). The IOA is especially important as it can be used to distinguish different ecological roles in arthropods, being low in modern active arthropod predators.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn contrast to all other pterygotid genera, notably the very visually acute ''[[Pterygotus]]'' and ''[[Jaekelopterus]]'', the eyes of ''Acutiramus'' were low in visual acuity (with few lenses in the compound eyes and high IOA values), inconsistent with the traditionally assumed pterygotid lifestyle of \"active and high-level visual predators\".<ref name=\":1\" /> The IOA values of ''Acutiramus'' changed during ontogeny but in a way opposite to other pterygotids. Vision becomes less acute in larger specimens, whilst vision tends to get more acute in adults in other genera, such as in ''Jaekelopterus''. Pterygotids may thus have been almost equally visually acute early in their life cycle, becoming more differentiated during growth.<ref name=\":1\" />[[File:Acutiramus Size.svg|thumb|The size of the largest (''A. bohemicus'') and smallest (''A. floweri'') species of ''Acutiramus'' compared to a human.]]The chelicerae of other pterygotids mainly served grasping functions and could also potentially be used for crushing and puncturing in ''Pterygotus'' and ''Jaekelopterus'', with large and robust claws. In contrast, the chelicerae of ''Acutiramus'' likely served a slicing or shearing function. The chelicerae themselves were large, but with differentiated denticles out of which one was serrated, long and strongly inclined.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe differences from other pterygotids on the basis of visual acuity and the morphology of the claws indicates that ''Acutiramus'' occupied an ecological role distinct from other members of the group and was a significantly less active predator.<ref name=\":1\" /> The weaker visual system and shearing claws of ''Acutiramus'' suggest that it might have been an ambush predator, or possible a scavenger, that fed on soft-bodied animals, feeding during the night or in otherwise low-light conditions.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn [[Bohemia]], pterygotid eurypterids occur in strata that were once marine environments, associated with common and diverse marine fossils. ''A. bohemicus'' occurs together with [[trilobite]] fossils such as ''[[Prionopeltis]]'' and ''[[Schariya]]'' as well as in assemblages where [[orthocone]] [[cephalopod]]s are common.
