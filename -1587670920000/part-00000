Naismith|Naismith]]'s rule<ref name=\"Naismith1892\" /><ref name=\"Holman10\" />]]\n'''Naismith's rule''' helps with the planning of a walking or [[hiking]] expedition by calculating how long it will take to travel the intended route, including any extra time taken when walking uphill. This [[rule of thumb]] was devised by [[William W. Naismith]], a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Mountaineering|mountaineer]], in 1892.<ref name=\"Naismith1892\" /><ref name=Thompson2010/><ref name=\"Scarf08\" /> A modern version can be formulated as follows:\n:Allow one hour for every {{convert|3|mi|km|sigfig=1}} forward, plus an additional hour for every {{convert|2000|ft|m|sigfig=1}} of ascent.<ref name=\"Holman10\" /><ref name=\"Aitken1977\" /><ref name=\"MWC\" />\n\n==Assumptions and calculations==\n[[File:Pace, Naismith's rule.svg|thumb|220px|[[Pace (speed)#Running|Pace]]<ref name=\"Kay12_1\" /> in minutes per [[kilometre]] or [[mile]] vs. slope angle resulting from Naismith's rule<ref name=Magyari2012/> for basal speeds of 5 and 4 km / h.{{refn|group=n|name=a|Speed and [[Pace (speed)#Running|pace]] for the Naismith rule were calculated here for its [[Metric system|metric]] version (5 kilometres horizontally and 600 meters of ascent), not the original one (3 mi and 2,000 ft).<br />In case of Naismith rule and Langmuir corrections the same, not modified value of ascent and descent was used for the distance of 4 km  as for 5 km \u2013 600 m for the Naismith rule and 300 m for Langmuir corrections (not taking into account the equivalence between distance and climb).}}]]\n\nThe original [[William W. Naismith|Naismith]]'s rule from 1892 says that one should allow one [[hour]] per three [[mile]]s on the map and an additional hour per 2000 [[Foot (unit)|feet]] of ascent.<ref name=\"Naismith1892\" /><ref name=\"Scarf08\" /> It is included in the last sentence of his report from a trip.<ref name=\"Naismith1892\" /><ref name=\"MacInnes13\" />\n\nToday it is formulated in many ways. Naismith's 1 h / 3&nbsp;mi + 1 h / 2000&nbsp;ft can be replaced by:\n* 1 h / 3&nbsp;mi (5&nbsp;km) + 1 h / 2000&nbsp;ft (600 m)<ref name=\"Holman10\" /><ref name=\"Aitken1977\" /><ref name=\"MWC\" />\n* 1 h / 5&nbsp;km (3&nbsp;mi) + 1/2 h / 300&nbsp;m (1000&nbsp;ft)<ref name=\"Evans10\" /><ref name=\"Marsh12\" /><ref name=\"Bagshaw06\" />\n* 3 [[Miles per hour|mph]] + \u00bd h / 1000&nbsp;ft<br />5&nbsp;[[Kilometres per hour|km/h]] + \u00bd h / 300&nbsp;m<ref name=Langmuir2013 />{{refn|group=n|name=b|Langmuir 2013 recalls the Naismith's rule from 1892 in [[mile]]s and [[Foot (unit)|feet]], but further gives and uses it in [[Metric system|metric]] system, [[climbing]] sometimes per contour line on a map (10 m or 50 m).<ref name=Langmuir2013 /> }}\n* 12 min / 1&nbsp;km + 10 min / 100 m<ref name=\"MacInnes13\" />\n\nThe basic rule assumes hikers of reasonable fitness, on typical terrain, and under normal conditions. It does not account for delays, such as extended breaks for rest or sightseeing, or for navigational obstacles. For planning expeditions a team leader may use Naismith's rule in putting together a [[route card]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIt is possible to apply adjustments or \"corrections\" for more challenging terrain, although it cannot be used for [[scrambling]] routes. In the grading system used in [[North America]], Naismith's rule applies only to hikes rated [[Hiking|Class 1]] on the [[Yosemite Decimal System]], and not to [[Scrambling|Class 2]] or higher.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn practice, the results of Naismith's rule are usually considered the ''minimum'' time necessary to complete a route.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nWhen walking in groups, the speed of the slowest person is calculated.<ref name=Langmuir2013 />\n\nNaismith's rule appears in UK statute law, although not by name. The Adventure Activities Licensing Regulations apply to providers of various activities including trekking. Part of the definition of trekking is that it is over terrain on which it would take more than 30 minutes to reach a road or refuge (by the quickest safe route), based on a walking speed of 5 kilometres per hour plus an additional minute for every 10 metres of ascent.<ref name=\"legislationgovuk\" />\n\n[[File:Hiking speed.svg|thumb|none|400px|A plot of walking speed versus [[Grade (slope)|slope]] resulting from Naismith's rule <ref name=Magyari2012/> and Langmuir corrections <ref name=Magyari2012/><ref name=Langmuir1984/> for base speeds of 5&nbsp;km/h and 4&nbsp;km/h compared to [[Tobler's hiking function]].<ref name=Tobler1993/>{{refn|group=n|name=a}}]]\n\n==Scarf's equivalence between distance and climb==\nAlternatively, the rule can be used to determine the equivalent flat distance of a route. This is achieved by recognising that Naismith's rule implies an equivalence between distance and climb in time terms: 3 miles (=15,840 feet) of distance is equivalent in time terms to 2000 feet of climb.<ref name=Scarf2007/>\n\nProfessor Philip Scarf, Associate Dean of Research and Innovation and Professor of Applied Statistics at the [[University of Salford]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.salford.ac.uk/business-school/business-academics/philip-scarf |title=Professor Philip Scarf |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=www.salford.ac.uk |publisher=University of Salford |access-date= 1 February 2018 }}</ref> in research published in 2008, gives the following formula:<ref name=\"Scarf08\" />\n: equivalent distance = x + \u03b1\u00b7y\nwhere:\n:x = horizontal distance\n:y = vertical distance\n:\u03b1 = 7.92 (3 [[Mile|mi]] / 2000 ft<ref name=Scarf2007 /><ref name=\"Scarf08\" /><ref name=\"Kay12_2\" />), called Naismith\u2019s number by Scarf<ref name=Scarf2007 /><ref name=\"Scarf08\" /><ref name=\"Kay12_2\" />\n\nThat is, 7.92 units of distance are equivalent to 1 unit of climb. For convenience an 8 to 1 rule can be used. So, for example, if a route is {{convert|20|km}} with 1600 metres of climb (as is the case on leg 1 of the [[Bob Graham Round]], Keswick to Threlkeld), the equivalent flat distance of this route is 20+(1.6\u00d78)={{convert|32.8|km}}. Assuming an individual can maintain a speed on the flat of 5&nbsp;km/h, the route will take 6 hours and 34 minutes. The simplicity of this approach is that the time taken can be easily adjusted for an individual's own (chosen) speed on the flat; at 8&nbsp;km/h (flat speed) the route will take 4 hours and 6 minutes. The rule has been tested on [[fell running]] times and found to be reliable.<ref name=Scarf2007/> Scarf proposed this equivalence in 1998.<ref name=\"Scarf08\" /><ref name=\"Kay12_1\" />\n\nAs you can see, the Scarf's assumption allows also to calculate the time for each speed, not just one as in case of the original Naismith rule.\n\n===Pace===\n[[Pace (speed)#Running|Pace]] is the reciprocal of speed. It can be calculated here from the following formula:<ref name=\"Kay12_1\" /><ref name=\"Kay12_2\" />\n\n:p = p0\u00b7(1 + \u03b1\u00b7m)\n\nwhere:\n:p = pace\n:p0 = pace on flat terrain\n:m = gradient uphill\n\nThis formula is true for m\u22650 (uphill or flat terrain).<ref name=\"Kay12_1\" /><ref name=\"Kay12_2\" />\nIt assumes equivalence of distance and climb by applying mentioned earlier \u03b1 factor.<ref name=\"Scarf08\" /><ref name=\"Kay12_2\" />\n\nSample calculations: p0 = 12 min / km (for 5&nbsp;km / h speed), m = 0.6&nbsp;km climb / 5&nbsp;km distance = 0.12,  p = 12 \u00b7 (1 + 7.92 \u00b7 0.12) = 23.4 min / km.\n\n== Talbot's Rule ==\nDuring the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Covid-19]] pandemic of the 21st Century virtual running races became popular. Such running races were typically [[10km]] or [[Half marathon|half-marathons]] in which the participants would run their own course from their home, but stick to a set distance. As such each participant would be running a different route with varying amounts of height gain, over the same horizontal distance, whilst adhering to the [[social distancing]] guidelines. \n\nIn 2020 Dave Talbot, an adventure specialist from [[Bristol]], devised a simple method to help race organisers calculate fair results so that they reflected each respective height gain using the following formula:<blockquote>FT = RT - (2.4 x HG) / 60</blockquote>where:<blockquote>FT = Final Time (minutes)\n\nRT = Race Time (minutes)\n\nHG = Height Gain (metres)</blockquote>This equates to subtracting 2.4 seconds for every metre height gain, the equivalent of 1 minute for every 25m height gain. \n\nOn a bigger scale, subtract 4 minutes for every 100m height gain.\n\nNote that this formula was devised for running events (typically 10km to 21.1km) and assumes the participant is running/jogging, not walking. As in walking there are variables such as terrain and amount of kit carried, but generally these virtual races are run on regular surfaces such as tarmac or trail, with very little kit being carried.\n\nDuring the April of 2020 Dave Talbot shared his early findings with his adventure comrade Mike Alexander, based in [[Liverpool]]. Both went on to extensively use this formula on a growing number of virtual races during the Covid-19 pandemic. These virtual races provided some focus, motivation and fun to runners all over the world.\n\n==Other modifications==\nOver the years several adjustments have been formulated in an attempt to make the rule more accurate. The simplest correction is to add 25 or 50% to the time predicted using Naismith's rule. While this may be more accurate for some people or under certain conditions, it does not explicitly account for any additional variables. The accuracy of some corrections is disputed by some,<ref name=Smith2009/> in particular the speed at which walkers descend a gentle [[Grade (slope)|grade]]. Other common corrections are:\n* When walking on uneven or unstable terrain, allow 1 hour for every {{convert|4|km}} forward, instead of 1 hour per {{convert|5|km}}.\n* On a gentle decline (about 5\u201312\u00b0), subtract 10 minutes per 1000 feet of descent. On a steep decline (over 12\u00b0), add 10 minutes per 1000 feet of descent.\n\n===Tranter's corrections===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}\nTranter's corrections make adjustments for fitness and fatigue. Fitness is determined by the time it takes to climb 1000 feet over a distance of \u00bd mile (800 m). Additional adjustments for uneven or unstable terrain or conditions can be estimated by dropping one or more fitness levels.\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"background:#ffffc0\"\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Individual fitness in minutes\n|colspan=16 align=\"center\"|Time taken in hours estimated using Naismith's rule\n|-style=\"background:#ffc080\"\n|2||3||4||5||6||7||8||9||10||12||14||16||18||20||22||24\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ffc080\"|15 (very fit)\n|1||1.5||2||2.75||3.5||4.5||5.5||6.75||7.75||10||12.5||14.5||17||19.5||22||24\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ffc080\"|20\n|1.25||2.25||3.25||4.5||5.5||6.5||7.75||8.75||10||12.5||15||17.5||20||23\n|colspan=2 rowspan=3 style=\"background:silver\"|\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ffc080\"|25\n|1.5||3||4.25||5.5||7||8.5||10||11.5||13.25||15||17.5\n|colspan=3 rowspan=2 style=\"background:silver\"|\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ffc080\"|30\n|2||3.5||5||6.75||8.5||10.5||12.5||14.5\n|colspan=3 style=\"background:silver\"|\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ffc080\"|40\n|2.75||4.25||5.75||7.5||9.5||11.5\n|colspan=2 rowspan=2 style=\"background:silver\"|\n|colspan=8 align=\"center\" style=\"background:silver; color:red\"|Too much to be attempted\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ffc080\"|50 (unfit)\n|3.25||4.75||6.5||8.5\n|colspan=12 style=\"background:silver\"|\n|}\nFor example, if Naismith's rule estimates a journey time of 9 hours and your fitness level is 25, you should allow 11.5 hours.\n\n===Aitken corrections===\nAitken (1977) assumes that 1 h takes to cover 3&nbsp;mi (5&nbsp;km) on paths, tracks and roads, while this is reduced to 2\u00bd mi (4&nbsp;km) on all other surfaces.<ref name=Aitken1977/>\n\nFor both distances he gives an additional 1 h per 2000&nbsp;ft (600 m) of ascent.<ref name=Aitken1977/> So Aitken doesn't take into account equivalence between distance and climb (proposed by Scarf in 1998<ref name=\"Scarf08\" /><ref name=\"Kay12_1\" />).\n\n===Langmuir corrections===\n\nLangmuir (1984) extends the rule on descent. He assumes the [[William W. Naismith|Naismith]]'s base speed of 5&nbsp;km/h and makes the following further refinements for going downhill:<ref name=Langmuir2013 /><ref name=Langmuir1984 /><ref name=Caffin2013 />\n* subtract 10 minutes for every 300&nbsp;meters of descent for slopes between 5&nbsp;degrees and 12&nbsp;degrees<ref name=Langmuir2013 /><ref name=Langmuir1984 /><ref name=Caffin2013 />\n* add 10 minutes for every 300&nbsp;meters of descent for slopes greater than 12&nbsp;degrees<ref name=Langmuir1984 /><ref name=Caffin2013 />\nLater he says i.e., that [[Physical fitness|fitness]] of the slowest member of a party should be taken into account and thus more practical for a group is formula:<ref name=Langmuir2013 />\n* 4&nbsp;[[Kilometres per hour|km/h]] + 1&nbsp;h / 450 m of ascent<ref name=Langmuir2013 />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Preferred walking speed]]\n* [[Tobler's hiking function]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Naismith1892\">{{cite journal |last=Naismith |first=W.

Naismith|Naismith]]'s rule from 1892 says that one should allow one [[hour]] per three [[mile]]s on the map and an additional hour per 2000 [[Foot (unit)|feet]] of ascent.<ref name=\"Naismith1892\" /><ref name=\"Scarf08\" /> It is included in the last sentence of his report from a trip.<ref name=\"Naismith1892\" /><ref name=\"MacInnes13\" />\n\nToday it is formulated in many ways. Naismith's 1 h / 3&nbsp;mi + 1 h / 2000&nbsp;ft can be replaced by:\n* 1 h / 3&nbsp;mi (5&nbsp;km) + 1 h / 2000&nbsp;ft (600 m)<ref name=\"Holman10\" /><ref name=\"Aitken1977\" /><ref name=\"MWC\" />\n* 1 h / 5&nbsp;km (3&nbsp;mi) + 1/2 h / 300&nbsp;m (1000&nbsp;ft)<ref name=\"Evans10\" /><ref name=\"Marsh12\" /><ref name=\"Bagshaw06\" />\n* 3 [[Miles per hour|mph]] + \u00bd h / 1000&nbsp;ft<br />5&nbsp;[[Kilometres per hour|km/h]] + \u00bd h / 300&nbsp;m<ref name=Langmuir2013 />{{refn|group=n|name=b|Langmuir 2013 recalls the Naismith's rule from 1892 in [[mile]]s and [[Foot (unit)|feet]], but further gives and uses it in [[Metric system|metric]] system, [[climbing]] sometimes per contour line on a map (10 m or 50 m).<ref name=Langmuir2013 /> }}\n* 12 min / 1&nbsp;km + 10 min / 100 m<ref name=\"MacInnes13\" />\n\nThe basic rule assumes hikers of reasonable fitness, on typical terrain, and under normal conditions. It does not account for delays, such as extended breaks for rest or sightseeing, or for navigational obstacles. For planning expeditions a team leader may use Naismith's rule in putting together a [[route card]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIt is possible to apply adjustments or \"corrections\" for more challenging terrain, although it cannot be used for [[scrambling]] routes. In the grading system used in [[North America]], Naismith's rule applies only to hikes rated [[Hiking|Class 1]] on the [[Yosemite Decimal System]], and not to [[Scrambling|Class 2]] or higher.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn practice, the results of Naismith's rule are usually considered the ''minimum'' time necessary to complete a route.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nWhen walking in groups, the speed of the slowest person is calculated.<ref name=Langmuir2013 />\n\nNaismith's rule appears in UK statute law, although not by name. The Adventure Activities Licensing Regulations apply to providers of various activities including trekking. Part of the definition of trekking is that it is over terrain on which it would take more than 30 minutes to reach a road or refuge (by the quickest safe route), based on a walking speed of 5 kilometres per hour plus an additional minute for every 10 metres of ascent.<ref name=\"legislationgovuk\" />\n\n[[File:Hiking speed.svg|thumb|none|400px|A plot of walking speed versus [[Grade (slope)|slope]] resulting from Naismith's rule <ref name=Magyari2012/> and Langmuir corrections <ref name=Magyari2012/><ref name=Langmuir1984/> for base speeds of 5&nbsp;km/h and 4&nbsp;km/h compared to [[Tobler's hiking function]].<ref name=Tobler1993/>{{refn|group=n|name=a}}]]\n\n==Scarf's equivalence between distance and climb==\nAlternatively, the rule can be used to determine the equivalent flat distance of a route. This is achieved by recognising that Naismith's rule implies an equivalence between distance and climb in time terms: 3 miles (=15,840 feet) of distance is equivalent in time terms to 2000 feet of climb.<ref name=Scarf2007/>\n\nProfessor Philip Scarf, Associate Dean of Research and Innovation and Professor of Applied Statistics at the [[University of Salford]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.salford.ac.uk/business-school/business-academics/philip-scarf |title=Professor Philip Scarf |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=www.salford.ac.uk |publisher=University of Salford |access-date= 1 February 2018 }}</ref> in research published in 2008, gives the following formula:<ref name=\"Scarf08\" />\n: equivalent distance = x + \u03b1\u00b7y\nwhere:\n:x = horizontal distance\n:y = vertical distance\n:\u03b1 = 7.92 (3 [[Mile|mi]] / 2000 ft<ref name=Scarf2007 /><ref name=\"Scarf08\" /><ref name=\"Kay12_2\" />), called Naismith\u2019s number by Scarf<ref name=Scarf2007 /><ref name=\"Scarf08\" /><ref name=\"Kay12_2\" />\n\nThat is, 7.92 units of distance are equivalent to 1 unit of climb. For convenience an 8 to 1 rule can be used. So, for example, if a route is {{convert|20|km}} with 1600 metres of climb (as is the case on leg 1 of the [[Bob Graham Round]], Keswick to Threlkeld), the equivalent flat distance of this route is 20+(1.6\u00d78)={{convert|32.8|km}}. Assuming an individual can maintain a speed on the flat of 5&nbsp;km/h, the route will take 6 hours and 34 minutes. The simplicity of this approach is that the time taken can be easily adjusted for an individual's own (chosen) speed on the flat; at 8&nbsp;km/h (flat speed) the route will take 4 hours and 6 minutes. The rule has been tested on [[fell running]] times and found to be reliable.<ref name=Scarf2007/> Scarf proposed this equivalence in 1998.<ref name=\"Scarf08\" /><ref name=\"Kay12_1\" />\n\nAs you can see, the Scarf's assumption allows also to calculate the time for each speed, not just one as in case of the original Naismith rule.\n\n===Pace===\n[[Pace (speed)#Running|Pace]] is the reciprocal of speed. It can be calculated here from the following formula:<ref name=\"Kay12_1\" /><ref name=\"Kay12_2\" />\n\n:p = p0\u00b7(1 + \u03b1\u00b7m)\n\nwhere:\n:p = pace\n:p0 = pace on flat terrain\n:m = gradient uphill\n\nThis formula is true for m\u22650 (uphill or flat terrain).<ref name=\"Kay12_1\" /><ref name=\"Kay12_2\" />\nIt assumes equivalence of distance and climb by applying mentioned earlier \u03b1 factor.<ref name=\"Scarf08\" /><ref name=\"Kay12_2\" />\n\nSample calculations: p0 = 12 min / km (for 5&nbsp;km / h speed), m = 0.6&nbsp;km climb / 5&nbsp;km distance = 0.12,  p = 12 \u00b7 (1 + 7.92 \u00b7 0.12) = 23.4 min / km.\n\n==Other modifications==\nOver the years several adjustments have been formulated in an attempt to make the rule more accurate. The simplest correction is to add 25 or 50% to the time predicted using Naismith's rule. While this may be more accurate for some people or under certain conditions, it does not explicitly account for any additional variables. The accuracy of some corrections is disputed by some,<ref name=Smith2009/> in particular the speed at which walkers descend a gentle [[Grade (slope)|grade]]. Other common corrections are:\n* When walking on uneven or unstable terrain, allow 1 hour for every {{convert|4|km}} forward, instead of 1 hour per {{convert|5|km}}.\n* On a gentle decline (about 5\u201312\u00b0), subtract 10 minutes per 1000 feet of descent. On a steep decline (over 12\u00b0), add 10 minutes per 1000 feet of descent.\n\n===Tranter's corrections===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}\nTranter's corrections make adjustments for fitness and fatigue. Fitness is determined by the time it takes to climb 1000 feet over a distance of \u00bd mile (800 m). Additional adjustments for uneven or unstable terrain or conditions can be estimated by dropping one or more fitness levels.\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"background:#ffffc0\"\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Individual fitness in minutes\n|colspan=16 align=\"center\"|Time taken in hours estimated using Naismith's rule\n|-style=\"background:#ffc080\"\n|2||3||4||5||6||7||8||9||10||12||14||16||18||20||22||24\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ffc080\"|15 (very fit)\n|1||1.5||2||2.75||3.5||4.5||5.5||6.75||7.75||10||12.5||14.5||17||19.5||22||24\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ffc080\"|20\n|1.25||2.25||3.25||4.5||5.5||6.5||7.75||8.75||10||12.5||15||17.5||20||23\n|colspan=2 rowspan=3 style=\"background:silver\"|\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ffc080\"|25\n|1.5||3||4.25||5.5||7||8.5||10||11.5||13.25||15||17.5\n|colspan=3 rowspan=2 style=\"background:silver\"|\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ffc080\"|30\n|2||3.5||5||6.75||8.5||10.5||12.5||14.5\n|colspan=3 style=\"background:silver\"|\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ffc080\"|40\n|2.75||4.25||5.75||7.5||9.5||11.5\n|colspan=2 rowspan=2 style=\"background:silver\"|\n|colspan=8 align=\"center\" style=\"background:silver; color:red\"|Too much to be attempted\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ffc080\"|50 (unfit)\n|3.25||4.75||6.5||8.5\n|colspan=12 style=\"background:silver\"|\n|}\nFor example, if Naismith's rule estimates a journey time of 9 hours and your fitness level is 25, you should allow 11.5 hours.\n\n===Aitken corrections===\nAitken (1977) assumes that 1 h takes to cover 3&nbsp;mi (5&nbsp;km) on paths, tracks and roads, while this is reduced to 2\u00bd mi (4&nbsp;km) on all other surfaces.<ref name=Aitken1977/>\n\nFor both distances he gives an additional 1 h per 2000&nbsp;ft (600 m) of ascent.<ref name=Aitken1977/> So Aitken doesn't take into account equivalence between distance and climb (proposed by Scarf in 1998<ref name=\"Scarf08\" /><ref name=\"Kay12_1\" />).\n\n===Langmuir corrections===\n\nLangmuir (1984) extends the rule on descent. He assumes the [[William W. Naismith|Naismith]]'s base speed of 5&nbsp;km/h and makes the following further refinements for going downhill:<ref name=Langmuir2013 /><ref name=Langmuir1984 /><ref name=Caffin2013 />\n* subtract 10 minutes for every 300&nbsp;meters of descent for slopes between 5&nbsp;degrees and 12&nbsp;degrees<ref name=Langmuir2013 /><ref name=Langmuir1984 /><ref name=Caffin2013 />\n* add 10 minutes for every 300&nbsp;meters of descent for slopes greater than 12&nbsp;degrees<ref name=Langmuir1984 /><ref name=Caffin2013 />\nLater he says i.e., that [[Physical fitness|fitness]] of the slowest member of a party should be taken into account and thus more practical for a group is formula:<ref name=Langmuir2013 />\n* 4&nbsp;[[Kilometres per hour|km/h]] + 1&nbsp;h / 450 m of ascent<ref name=Langmuir2013 />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Preferred walking speed]]\n* [[Tobler's hiking function]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Naismith1892\">{{cite journal |last=Naismith |first=W.

Barkun writes that conspiracies are \"actual covert plots planned and/or carried out by two or more persons\". A conspiracy theory, on the other hand, is \"an intellectual construct\", a \"template imposed upon the world to give the appearance of order to events\". Positing that \"some small and hidden group\" has manipulated events, a conspiracy theory can be local or international, focused on single events or covering multiple incidents and entire countries, regions and periods of history.

This refers to limited and well-defined events.  Examples may include such conspiracies theories as those concerning the [[Kennedy assassination conspiracies|Kennedy assassination]], [[9/11]], and the [[discredited AIDS origins theories|spread of AIDS]].{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=6}}\n* ''Systemic conspiracy theories''.  The conspiracy is believed to have broad goals, usually conceived as securing control of a country, a region, or even the entire world. The goals are sweeping, whilst the conspiratorial machinery is generally simple: a single, evil organization implements a plan to infiltrate and subvert existing institutions. This is a common scenario in conspiracy theories that focus on the alleged machinations of [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Jews]], [[Masonic conspiracy theories|Freemasons]], [[Red Scare|Communism]], or the [[Vatican conspiracy theories|Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=6}}\n* ''Superconspiracy theories''. For Barkun, such theories link multiple alleged conspiracies together hierarchically.  At the summit is a distant but all-powerful evil force.  His cited examples are the ideas of [[David Icke]] and [[Milton William Cooper]].{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=6}}\n\n=== Rothbard: shallow vs. deep ===\n[[Murray Rothbard]] argues in favor of a model that contrasts \"deep\" conspiracy theories to \"shallow\" ones. According to Rothbard, a \"shallow\" theorist observes an event and asks ''[[Cui bono]]''? (\"Who benefits?\"), jumping to the conclusion that a posited beneficiary is responsible for covertly influencing events.  On the other hand, the \"deep\" conspiracy theorist begins with a hunch and then seeks out evidence. Rothbard describes this latter activity as a matter of confirming with certain facts one's initial paranoia.<ref>As quoted by B.K.

They trace all evil back to a single source, the conspirators and their agents. \n* Third, conspiracy theories are often presented as special, [[esotericism|secret knowledge]] unknown or unappreciated by others.

This projection, according to the argument, is manifested in the form of attribution of undesirable characteristics of the self to the conspirators. Historian Richard Hofstadter stated that:\n\n{{quote|This enemy seems on many counts a projection of the self; both the ideal and the unacceptable aspects of the self are attributed to him. A fundamental paradox of the paranoid style is the imitation of the enemy. The enemy, for example, may be the cosmopolitan intellectual, but the paranoid will outdo him in the apparatus of scholarship, even of pedantry.&nbsp;...&nbsp;The Ku Klux Klan imitated Catholicism to the point of donning priestly vestments, developing an elaborate ritual and an equally elaborate hierarchy. The [[John Birch Society]] emulates Communist cells and quasi-secret operation through \"front\" groups, and preaches a ruthless prosecution of the ideological war along lines very similar to those it finds in the Communist enemy. Spokesmen of the various fundamentalist anti-Communist \"crusades\" openly express their admiration for the dedication, discipline, and strategic ingenuity the Communist cause calls forth.<ref name=\"harpers=1964\"/>}}\n\nHofstadter also noted that \"sexual freedom\" is a vice frequently attributed to the conspiracist's target group, noting that \"very often the fantasies of true believers reveal strong sadomasochistic outlets, vividly expressed, for example, in the delight of anti-Masons with the cruelty of Masonic punishments.\"<ref name=\"harpers=1964\">{{cite book|author=Hofstadter, Richard|author-link=Richard Hofstadter|year=1965|title=The Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays|location=New York|publisher=Alfred A.

While the complete facts of the situation and correct methodology are ostensibly important to them, Latour proposes that the scientific process is instead laid on as a patina to one's pet theories to lend a sort of reputation high ground. The \"fact position\" argues that individuals are dominated, often covertly and without their awareness, by external forces (e.g., economics, gender).{{r|critiquesteam|page2=238}} Latour concludes that each of these two approaches in Academia has led to a polarized, inefficient atmosphere highlighted (in both approaches) by its causticness. \"Do you see now why it feels so good to be a critical mind?\" asks Latour: no matter which position you take, \"You're always right!\"{{r|critiquesteam|page3=238\u201339}}\n\nLatour notes that such social criticism has been appropriated by those he describes as conspiracy theorists, including [[climate change denial]]ists and the [[9/11 Truth movement]]: \"Maybe I am taking conspiracy theories too seriously, but I am worried to detect, in those mad mixtures of knee-jerk disbelief, punctilious demands for proofs, and free use of powerful explanation from the social neverland, many of the weapons of social critique.\"{{r|critiquesteam|page4=230}}\n\n===Fusion paranoia===\n[[Michael Kelly (editor)|Michael Kelly]], a ''[[Washington Post]]'' journalist and critic of [[anti-war]] movements on both the left and right, coined the term \"fusion paranoia\" to refer to a political convergence of left-wing and right-wing activists around anti-war issues and [[civil liberties]], which he said were motivated by a shared belief in conspiracism or shared [[Anti-statism|anti-government]] views.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1995/06/19/the-road-to-paranoia|title=THE ROAD TO PARANOIA|last=Kelly|first=Michael|date=12 June 1995|work=The New Yorker|access-date=9 April 2018|issn=0028-792X}}</ref>\n\nBarkun has adopted this term to refer to how the synthesis of paranoid conspiracy theories, which were once limited to American fringe audiences, has given them mass appeal and enabled them to become commonplace in [[mass media]],{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=230}} thereby inaugurating an unrivaled period of people actively preparing for [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] or [[millenarianism|millenarian]] scenarios in the United States of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.{{sfn|Barkun|2003|pp=207, 210, 211}} Barkun notes the occurrence of lone-wolf conflicts with law enforcement acting as proxy for threatening the established political powers.{{sfn|Barkun|2003|pp=193, 197}}\n\n==Viability of conspiracies==\nThe physicist [[David Robert Grimes]] estimated the time it would take for a conspiracy to be exposed based on the number of people involved.<ref name=\"pbs_plos_one\">{{cite web|last1=Barajas|first1=Joshua|title=How many people does it take to keep a conspiracy alive?|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/math-formula-charts-the-lifespan-of-hoaxes/|website=PBS NEWSHOUR|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)|accessdate=22 July 2016|date=15 February 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Grimes_PLOS_ONE\">{{cite journal|last1=Grimes|first1=David R|authorlink1=David Robert Grimes|title=On the Viability of Conspiratorial Beliefs|journal=PLOS ONE|date=26 January 2016|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0147905|pmid=26812482|volume=11|issue=1|pmc=4728076|pages=e0147905|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1147905G}}</ref> His calculations used data from the [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM surveillance program]], the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]], and the [[FBI Laboratory#Controversy|FBI forensic scandal]].

Barkun writes that conspiracies are \"actual covert plots planned and/or carried out by two or more persons\". A conspiracy theory, on the other hand, is \"an intellectual construct\", a \"template imposed upon the world to give the appearance of order to events\". Positing that \"some small and hidden group\" has manipulated events, a conspiracy theory can be local or international, focused on single events or covering multiple incidents and entire countries, regions and periods of history. Conspiracy theorists see themselves as having privileged access to special knowledge or a special mode of thought that separates them from the masses who believe the official account.<ref name=\"Barkun2016\">{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/0392192116669288|title=Conspiracy Theories as Stigmatized Knowledge|journal=Diogenes|pages=039219211666928|year=2016|last1=Barkun|first1=Michael}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n{{See|List of conspiracy theories}}\nA conspiracy theory may take any matter as its subject, but certain subjects attract greater interest than others. Favored subjects include famous deaths and assassinations, morally dubious government activities, suppressed technologies, and \u201c[[false flag]]\u201d terrorism. Among the longest-standing and most widely recognized conspiracy theories are notions concerning the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the 1969 Apollo moon landings, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks, as well as numerous theories pertaining to alleged plots for world domination by various groups both real and imaginary.<ref>{{Cite news|title=History's greatest conspiracy theories|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/historys-greatest-conspiracy-theories/|date=12 November 2008|newspaper=The Telegraph}}</ref>\n\n==Popularity==\nScholars argue that conspiracy theories once limited to fringe audiences have become commonplace in [[mass media]], contributing to conspiracism emerging as a [[cultural phenomenon]] in the United States of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=58}}<ref name=\"Camp 1997\">{{Cite book|title=Selling Fear: Conspiracy Theories and End-Times Paranoia|author=Camp, Gregory S.|publisher=Commish Walsh|year=1997|asin=B000J0N8NC}}</ref><ref name=\"Goldberg 2001\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/enemieswithincul00gold_0|title=Enemies Within: The Culture of Conspiracy in Modern America|author=Goldberg, Robert Alan|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-300-09000-0}}</ref><ref name=\"Fenster 2008\">{{Cite book|title=Conspiracy Theories: Secrecy and Power in American Culture|author=Fenster, Mark|publisher=University of Minnesota Press; 2nd edition|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8166-5494-9}}</ref> The general predisposition to believe conspiracy theories cuts across partisan and ideological lines.

This refers to limited and well-defined events.  Examples may include such conspiracies theories as those concerning the [[Kennedy assassination conspiracies|Kennedy assassination]], [[9/11]], and the [[discredited AIDS origins theories|spread of AIDS]].{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=6}}\n* ''Systemic conspiracy theories''.  The conspiracy is believed to have broad goals, usually conceived as securing control of a country, a region, or even the entire world. The goals are sweeping, whilst the conspiratorial machinery is generally simple: a single, evil organization implements a plan to infiltrate and subvert existing institutions. This is a common scenario in conspiracy theories that focus on the alleged machinations of [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Jews]], [[Masonic conspiracy theories|Freemasons]], [[Red Scare|Communism]], or the [[Vatican conspiracy theories|Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=6}}\n* ''Superconspiracy theories''. For Barkun, such theories link multiple alleged conspiracies together hierarchically.  At the summit is a distant but all-powerful evil force.  His cited examples are the ideas of [[David Icke]] and [[Milton William Cooper]].{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=6}}\n\n=== Rothbard: shallow vs. deep ===\n[[Murray Rothbard]] argues in favor of a model that contrasts \"deep\" conspiracy theories to \"shallow\" ones. According to Rothbard, a \"shallow\" theorist observes an event and asks ''[[Cui bono]]''? (\"Who benefits?\"), jumping to the conclusion that a posited beneficiary is responsible for covertly influencing events.  On the other hand, the \"deep\" conspiracy theorist begins with a hunch and then seeks out evidence. Rothbard describes this latter activity as a matter of confirming with certain facts one's initial paranoia.<ref>As quoted by B.K. Marcus in \"[https://mises.org/journals/jls/20_2/20_2_2.pdf Radio Free Rothbard],\" ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'', Vol 20, No 2. (SPRING 2006): pp 17\u201351.
