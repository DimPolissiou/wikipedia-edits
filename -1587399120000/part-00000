It opened in 1851 as the Pioneer School by Dutch immigrants four years after the community was first settled. The first freshman college class matriculated in 1862 and Hope received its state charter in 1866. Hope College is affiliated with the [[Reformed Church in America]] and it retains a Christian atmosphere. The school's {{convert|125|acre|mi2}} campus is adjacent to the downtown commercial district and has been shared with [[Western Theological Seminary]] since 1884.\n\n==History==\nHope's motto is taken from [[Psalm]] 42:6: \"Spera in Deo\" (\"Hope in God\"). The college's emblem is an [[anchor]]. This is drawn from a speech made by [[Albertus van Raalte]], the leader of the community, on the occasion of the founding of the Pioneer School in 1851: \"This is my anchor of hope for this people in the future,\" (an allusion to [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 6:19). The primary-level Pioneer School was later expanded to secondary, and soon after, college level education as Hope College. Van Vleck Hall, which originally housed the Pioneer School, is the oldest building on campus (1858) and now serves as a dormitory. It is the second oldest building in the city. The first freshman college class matriculated in 1862, and Hope received its state charter in 1866. The college admitted its first female students in 1878.\n\n2015 marks Hope College's 150th year of education. In honor of this celebration, Hope College held many events throughout 2015. The celebration began with the 150th commencement on May 3, 2015. The year held two grand openings, the Kruizenga Art Museum and the Jack H. Miller Center for Musical Arts, and the groundbreaking ceremony of the Jim and Martie Bultman Student Center. The College also sponsored the Presidential Colloquium lecture series which featured an address by David Brooks on Christian education in the 21st century.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hope.edu/news/2015/campus-life/birthday-bash.html|title=Birthday Bash|first1=Contact Hope College PO|last1=Box 9000|last2=Holl|first3=Michigan 49422-9000|last3=work 616.395.7000|website=Birthday Bash}}</ref>\n\n===Presidents===\nThe following people have presided over the college:<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hope College |title=Presidents of Hope College |url=http://hope.edu/president/presidents-hope-college |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624182116/http://hope.edu/president/presidents-hope-college |archivedate=2015-06-24 }}</ref>\n\n# Philip Phelps Jr. (1866-1878)\n# Charles Scott (1878-1893)\n# Gerrit J.

The Pull takes place across the Black River in Holland, Michigan, and now takes place on the last Saturday of September every year ( Prior to 1993 it was held on a Friday). The Pull dates back to 1898. During the Pull, each team has 18 students on the rope as \"pullers,\" and another 18 acting as guides and morale boosters, or \"moralers.\" The freshmen are coached by the junior class, and the sophomores by the seniors. This arrangement has led to the rivalry between even and odd year classes. Even year's colors are red and white, while Odd year's colors are maroon and gold. The competition is now limited to three hours; however, it previously had no time limit. The winner is decided by a measure of which team has taken the most rope.\n\n[[File:Hopecollegepull.jpg|thumb|alt=The Pull|A view of the Odd year side at the 114th pull]]\n\n''The Nykerk Cup Competition''\n\nThe Nykerk Cup is a multi-faceted competition between freshmen and sophomore women that involves song, play, and oration. In the same way as the Pull, the freshmen are coached by the juniors and the sophomores by the seniors, also contributing to the \"Odd Year\" and \"Even Year\" competitions. The Nykerk Cup takes place during Family Weekend in late fall. The tradition was begun in 1935 by John Nykerk. Men participate in the competition as \"moralers\" by supporting all female participants while building sets and coordinating scene changes for the competition.<ref>[http://www.hope.edu/offices/student-life/hope-traditions/nykerk-cup-competition.html], Hope College, 2017</ref>\n\n''Winter Fantasia''\n\nOne formal dance is offered by the college in February.

This event takes place in the spring semester. Students volunteer to be dancers or morale for the event. Dancers stand on their feet and dance for 24 hours while moral take shifts to support the dancers throughout the day and night. Children of the hospital often make a visit to show their thanks and support the dancers.\n\n''Christmas Vespers''\n\nEach December, Hope College hosts a musical Christmas service in Dimnent Chapel. The service, which has been held annually since 1941 features over 200 students, staff and faculty.

It opened in 1851 as the Pioneer School by Dutch immigrants four years after the community was first settled. The first freshman college class matriculated in 1862 and Hope received its state charter in 1866. Hope College is affiliated with the [[Reformed Church in America]] and it retains a Christian atmosphere. The school's {{convert|125|acre|mi2}} campus is adjacent to the downtown commercial district and has been shared with [[Western Theological Seminary]] since 1884.\n\n==History==\nHope's motto is taken from [[Psalm]] 42:6: \"Spera in Deo\" (\"Hope in God\"). The college's emblem is an [[anchor]]. This is drawn from a speech made by [[Albertus van Raalte]], the leader of the community, on the occasion of the founding of the Pioneer School in 1851: \"This is my anchor of hope for this people in the future,\" (an allusion to [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 6:19). The primary-level Pioneer School was later expanded to secondary, and soon after, college level education as Hope College. Van Vleck Hall, which originally housed the Pioneer School, is the oldest building on campus (1858) and now serves as a dormitory. It is the second oldest building in the city. The first freshman college class matriculated in 1862, and Hope received its state charter in 1866. The college admitted its first female students in 1878.\n\n2015 marks Hope College's 150th year of education. In honor of this celebration, Hope College held many events throughout 2015. The celebration began with the 150th commencement on May 3, 2015. The year held two grand openings, the Kruizenga Art Museum and the Jack H. Miller Center for Musical Arts, and the groundbreaking ceremony of the Jim and Martie Bultman Student Center. The College also sponsored the Presidential Colloquium lecture series which featured an address by David Brooks on Christian education in the 21st century.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hope.edu/news/2015/campus-life/birthday-bash.html|title=Birthday Bash|first1=Contact Hope College PO|last1=Box 9000|last2=Holl|first3=Michigan 49422-9000|last3=work 616.395.7000|website=Birthday Bash}}</ref>\n\n===Presidents===\nThe following people have presided over the college:<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hope College |title=Presidents of Hope College |url=http://hope.edu/president/presidents-hope-college |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624182116/http://hope.edu/president/presidents-hope-college |archivedate=2015-06-24 }}</ref>\n\n# Philip Phelps Jr. (1866-1878)\n# Charles Scott (1878-1893)\n# Gerrit J.

The Pull takes place across the Black River in Holland, Michigan, and now takes place on the last Saturday of September every year ( Prior to 1993 it was held on a Friday). The Pull dates back to 1898. During the Pull, each team has 18 students on the rope as \"pullers,\" and another 18 acting as guides and morale boosters, or \"moralers.\" The freshmen are coached by the junior class, and the sophomores by the seniors. This arrangement has led to the rivalry between even and odd year classes. Even year's colors are red and white, while Odd year's colors are maroon and gold. The competition is now limited to three hours; however, it previously had no time limit. The winner is decided by a measure of which team has taken the most rope.\n\n[[File:Hopecollegepull.jpg|thumb|alt=The Pull|A view of the Odd year side at the 114th pull]]\n\n''The Nykerk Cup Competition''\n\nThe Nykerk Cup is a multi-faceted competition between freshmen and sophomore women that involves song, play, and oration. In the same way as the Pull, the freshmen are coached by the juniors and the sophomores by the seniors, also contributing to the \"Odd Year\" and \"Even Year\" competitions. The Nykerk Cup takes place during Family Weekend in late fall. The tradition was begun in 1935 by John Nykerk. Men participate in the competition as \"moralers\" by supporting all female participants while building sets and coordinating scene changes for the competition.<ref>[http://www.hope.edu/offices/student-life/hope-traditions/nykerk-cup-competition.html], Hope College, 2017</ref>\n\n''Winter Fantasia''\n\nOne formal dance is offered by the college in February. Students may attend in large groups or with dates, and the college offers transportation to Grand Rapids, where the dance takes place.\n\n''Dance Marathon''\n\nThe students of Hope College hold the annual Dance Marathon to raise money for the Helen Devos Children's Hospital in Grand Rapids. This event takes place in the spring semester. Students volunteer to be dancers or morale for the event. Dancers stand on their feet and dance for 24 hours while moral take shifts to support the dancers throughout the day and night. Children of the hospital often make a visit to show their thanks and support the dancers.\n\n''Christmas Vespers''\n\nEach December, Hope College hosts a musical Christmas service in Dimnent Chapel. The service, which has been held annually since 1941 features over 200 students, staff and faculty. The program includes music performed by the Chapel Choir, College Chorus, Orchestra, and other small ensembles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whtc.com/news/articles/2017/dec/01/hope-college-christmas-vespers-services/|title=Hope College Christmas Vespers Services|first=Midwest Communications|last=Inc|website=1450 99.7 WHTC}}</ref> There are four performances each year, and all four draw a crowd which fills the large chapel.

The current [[List of Virginia Governors|Governor]] of Virginia is [[Ralph Northam]]. The [[Virginia State Capitol|State Capitol]] building in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] was designed by [[Thomas Jefferson]], and the cornerstone was laid by Governor [[Patrick Henry]] in [[1785]]. Virginia currently functions under the 1971 [[Constitution of Virginia]]. It is the Commonwealth's seventh [[constitution]]. Under the Constitution, the government is composed of three branches, the legislative, the executive and the judicial.\n\n==Executive branch==\nThe statewide elected officials are governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general.\n\nAll three officers are separately elected  four-year terms in years following Presidential elections (1997, 2001, 2005, etc.) and take office in January of the following year. Virginia is one of only five states that elects its state officials in odd numbered years (the others are Kentucky, [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], and [[New Jersey]]). The last gubernatorial election was in 2017, and the next will occur in 2021.\n\nThe governor serves as chief executive officer of the Commonwealth and as commander-in-chief of its militia.  The Constitution does not allow a governor to succeed himself in office (though a governor is allowed to serve multiple non-consecutive terms). The Lieutenant Governor, who is not elected on the same ticket as the governor, serves as president of the [[Senate of Virginia]] and is first in the line of succession to the governor. The Lieutenant Governor is allowed to run for reelection. The Attorney General is chief legal advisor to the governor and the General Assembly, chief lawyer of the Commonwealth and the head of the Department of Law.

The positions of these constitutional officers are provided for by the Virginia Constitution. Article 7, Section 4 of the Virginia constitution provides, \"There shall be elected by the qualified voters of each county and city a treasurer, a sheriff, an attorney for the Commonwealth, a clerk, who shall be clerk of the court in the office of which deeds are recorded, and a commissioner of revenue.\" The local constitutional offices are not appointed by the city or county.

In colonial Virginia, the lower house of the legislature was called the [[House of Burgesses]]. Together with the Governor's Council, the House of Burgesses made up the \"General Assembly\". The Governor's Council was composed of 12 men appointed by the [[British monarch]] to advise the governor. The council also served as the \"General Court\" of the colony, a colonial equivalent of a [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]]. Members of the House of Burgesses were chosen by all those who could vote in the colony. Each county chose two people or burgesses to represent it, while the [[College of William and Mary]] and the cities of [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] and [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] each chose one burgess. The Burgesses met to make laws for the colony and set the direction for its future growth; the council would then review the laws and either approve or disapprove them. The approval of the Burgesses, the council, and the governor was needed to pass a law. The idea of electing burgesses was important and new. It gave Virginians a chance to control their own government for the first time. At first, the burgesses were elected by all free men in the colony. Women, indentured servants, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s could not vote. Later the rules for voting changed, making it necessary for men to own at least fifty acres (200,000 m\u00b2) of land in order to vote.\n\nLike many other states, by the 1850s Virginia featured a [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]], several executive officers, and an independent judiciary. By the time of the Constitution of 1901, which lasted longer than any other state constitution, the General Assembly continued as the legislature, the Supreme Court of Appeals acted as the judiciary, and the eight executive officers were elected: the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, Secretary of the Commonwealth, state treasurer, auditor of public accounts, superintendent of public instruction, and commissioner of agriculture and immigration. The Constitution of 1901 was amended many times, notably in the 1930s and 1950s, before it was abandoned in favor of more modern government, with fewer elected officials, reformed local governments and a more streamlined judiciary.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Politics of Virginia]]\n* [[Elections in Virginia]]\n* [[Republican Party of Virginia]]\n* [[Democratic Party of Virginia]]\n* [[Law of Virginia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat}}\n* [http://www.virginia.gov/ Virginia.gov]\n\n{{Virginia}}\n{{Governments of the United States}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Government of Virginia}}\n[[Category:Government of Virginia| ]]\n[[Category:State governments of the United States|Virginia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2013}}\n\n{{multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date October|date=October 2012}}\n{{update|date=December 2011}}\n}}\n\nThe ''' government  of Virginia''' combines the three branches of authority in the [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]]. The current [[List of Virginia Governors|Governor]] of Virginia is [[Ralph Northam]]. The [[Virginia State Capitol|State Capitol]] building in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] was designed by [[Thomas Jefferson]], and the cornerstone was laid by Governor [[Patrick Henry]] in [[1785]]. Virginia currently functions under the 1971 [[Constitution of Virginia]]. It is the Commonwealth's seventh [[constitution]]. Under the Constitution, the government is composed of three branches, the legislative, the executive and the judicial.\n\n==Executive branch==\nThe statewide elected officials are governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general.\n\nAll three officers are separately elected  four-year terms in years following Presidential elections (1997, 2001, 2005, etc.) and take office in January of the following year. Virginia is one of only five states that elects its state officials in odd numbered years (the others are Kentucky, [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], and [[New Jersey]]). The last gubernatorial election was in 2017, and the next will occur in 2021.\n\nThe governor serves as chief executive officer of the Commonwealth and as commander-in-chief of its militia.  The Constitution does not allow a governor to succeed himself in office (though a governor is allowed to serve multiple non-consecutive terms). The Lieutenant Governor, who is not elected on the same ticket as the governor, serves as president of the [[Senate of Virginia]] and is first in the line of succession to the governor. The Lieutenant Governor is allowed to run for reelection. The Attorney General is chief legal advisor to the governor and the General Assembly, chief lawyer of the Commonwealth and the head of the Department of Law. The attorney general is second in the line of succession to the governor. Whenever there is a vacancy in all three executive offices of governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general, then the [[List of Speakers of the Virginia House of Delegates|Speaker of the House]] of the Virginia House of Delegates becomes governor.\n\n===Cabinet===\nThe [[Virginia Governor's Cabinet]] is a body of the most senior appointed officers of the executive branch, responsible for advising the governor.

Biruni notes in the beginning of his book how the Muslims had a hard time learning about Hindu knowledge and culture.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> He explains that Hinduism and Islam are totally different from each other. Moreover, Hindus in 11th century India had suffered waves of destructive attacks on many of its cities, and Islamic armies had taken numerous Hindu slaves to Persia, which\u2014claimed Al-Biruni\u2014contributed to Hindus becoming suspicious of all foreigners, not just Muslims. Hindus considered Muslims violent and impure, and did not want to share anything with them. Over time, Al-Biruni won the welcome of Hindu scholars. Al-Biruni collected books and studied with these Hindu scholars to become fluent in Sanskrit, discover and translate into Arabic the mathematics, science, medicine, astronomy and other fields of arts as practiced in 11th-century India. He was inspired by the arguments offered by Indian scholars who believed earth must be globular in shape, which is the only way to fully explain the difference in daylight hours by latitude, seasons and earth's relative positions with moon and stars. At the same time, Al-Biruni was also critical of Indian scribes who he believed carelessly corrupted Indian documents while making copies of older documents.<ref>{{Cite book|last= B\u012br\u016bn\u012b |first=Mu\u1e25ammad ibn A\u1e25mad|date = 1910|title = Alberuni's India: An Account of the Religion, Philosophy, Literature, Geography, Chronology, Astronomy, Customs, Laws and Astrology of India about A.D. 1030|chapter = On the Hindus in General, as an Introduction to Our Account of Them|volume = 1|page = 17|publisher = Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner|place = London|url = http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_001/|accessdate = |postscript = see also Vol 2 of Al-Biruni's India.}}</ref> He also criticized the Hindus on what he saw them do and not do, like their deficiencies in curiosity about history and religion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nOne of the specific aspects of Hindu life that Al-Biruni studied was the Hindu calendar.

He developed a method for converting the dates of the Hindu calendar to the dates of the three different calendars that were common in the Islamic countries of his time period, the Greek, the Arab/Muslim, and the Persian.

The work includes research on a vast array of topics of Indian culture, including descriptions of their traditions and customs. Although he tried to stay away from political and military history, Biruni did indeed record important dates and noted actual sites of where significant battles occurred. Additionally, he chronicled stories of Indian rulers and told of how they ruled over their people with their beneficial actions and acted in the interests of the nation. But, his details are brief and mostly just list rulers without referring to their real names. He did not go on about deeds that each one carried out during their reign, which keeps in line with Al-Biruni's mission to try to stay away from political histories. Al-Biruni also described the geography of India in his work. He documented different bodies of water and other natural phenomena. These descriptions are useful to today's modern historians because they are able to use Biruni's scholarship to locate certain destinations in modern-day India. Historians are able to make some matches while also concluding that certain areas seem to have disappeared and been replaced with different cities. Different forts and landmarks were able to be located, legitimizing Al-Biruni's contributions with their usefulness to even modern history and archeology.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe dispassionate account of Hinduism given by Al-Biruni was remarkable for its time. He stated that he was fully objective in his writings, remaining unbiased like a proper historian should. Biruni documented everything about India just as it happened. But, he did note how some of the accounts of information that he was given by natives of the land may not have been reliable in terms of complete accuracy, however, he did try to be as honest as possible in his writing.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Mohammad Yasin compares it to \"a magic island of quiet, impartial research in the midst of a world of clashing swords, burning towns, and plundered temples.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Yasin|first1=Mohammad|title=Reading in Indian history|date=1988|publisher=Atlantic Publishers & Distri|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=978-8-1715-6120-9|pages=19|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hz4LJu1EqJIC|page=5}}|accessdate=22 June 2016}}</ref>\nBiruni's writing was very poetic, which may diminish some of the historical value of the work for modern times.

The classical results of Archimedes in the theory of the centre of gravity were generalized and applied to three-dimensional bodies, the theory of ponderable lever was founded and the 'science of gravity' was created and later further developed in medieval Europe. The phenomena of statics were studied by using the dynamic approach so that two trends \u2013 statics and dynamics \u2013 turned out to be inter-related within a single science, mechanics. The combination of the dynamic approach with Archimedean hydrostatics gave birth to a direction in science which may be called medieval hydrodynamics.

He studied [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]], and other religions. He treated religions objectively, striving to understand them on their own terms rather than trying to prove them wrong. His underlying concept was that all cultures are at least distant relatives of all other cultures because they are all human constructs. \"What al-Biruni seems to be arguing is that there is a common human element in every culture that makes all cultures distant relatives, however foreign they might seem to one another.\"{{sfn|Rosenthal|1976|p=10}}\n\nAl-Biruni divides [[Hindus]] into an educated and an uneducated class.

Biruni notes in the beginning of his book how the Muslims had a hard time learning about Hindu knowledge and culture.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> He explains that Hinduism and Islam are totally different from each other. Moreover, Hindus in 11th century India had suffered waves of destructive attacks on many of its cities, and Islamic armies had taken numerous Hindu slaves to Persia, which\u2014claimed Al-Biruni\u2014contributed to Hindus becoming suspicious of all foreigners, not just Muslims. Hindus considered Muslims violent and impure, and did not want to share anything with them. Over time, Al-Biruni won the welcome of Hindu scholars. Al-Biruni collected books and studied with these Hindu scholars to become fluent in Sanskrit, discover and translate into Arabic the mathematics, science, medicine, astronomy and other fields of arts as practiced in 11th-century India. He was inspired by the arguments offered by Indian scholars who believed earth must be globular in shape, which is the only way to fully explain the difference in daylight hours by latitude, seasons and earth's relative positions with moon and stars. At the same time, Al-Biruni was also critical of Indian scribes who he believed carelessly corrupted Indian documents while making copies of older documents.<ref>{{Cite book|last= B\u012br\u016bn\u012b |first=Mu\u1e25ammad ibn A\u1e25mad|date = 1910|title = Alberuni's India: An Account of the Religion, Philosophy, Literature, Geography, Chronology, Astronomy, Customs, Laws and Astrology of India about A.D. 1030|chapter = On the Hindus in General, as an Introduction to Our Account of Them|volume = 1|page = 17|publisher = Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner|place = London|url = http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_001/|accessdate = |postscript = see also Vol 2 of Al-Biruni's India.}}</ref> He also criticized the Hindus on what he saw them do and not do, like their deficiencies in curiosity about history and religion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nOne of the specific aspects of Hindu life that Al-Biruni studied was the Hindu calendar.

He developed a method for converting the dates of the Hindu calendar to the dates of the three different calendars that were common in the Islamic countries of his time period, the Greek, the Arab/Muslim, and the Persian. Biruni also employed astronomy in the determination of his theories, which were complex mathematical equations and scientific calculation that allows one to convert dates and years between the different calendars.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kennedy |last2=Engle |last3=Wamstad|first1=E.S. |first2=Susan |first3=Jeanne|title=The Hindu Calendar as Described in Al-Biruni's Masudic Canon|url=\n{{google books |plainurl=y |id=_OLYMgEACAAJ}}|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|date=1965|volume=24}}</ref>\n\nThe book does not limit itself to tedious records of battle because Al-Biruni found the social culture to be more important. The work includes research on a vast array of topics of Indian culture, including descriptions of their traditions and customs. Although he tried to stay away from political and military history, Biruni did indeed record important dates and noted actual sites of where significant battles occurred. Additionally, he chronicled stories of Indian rulers and told of how they ruled over their people with their beneficial actions and acted in the interests of the nation. But, his details are brief and mostly just list rulers without referring to their real names. He did not go on about deeds that each one carried out during their reign, which keeps in line with Al-Biruni's mission to try to stay away from political histories. Al-Biruni also described the geography of India in his work. He documented different bodies of water and other natural phenomena. These descriptions are useful to today's modern historians because they are able to use Biruni's scholarship to locate certain destinations in modern-day India. Historians are able to make some matches while also concluding that certain areas seem to have disappeared and been replaced with different cities. Different forts and landmarks were able to be located, legitimizing Al-Biruni's contributions with their usefulness to even modern history and archeology.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe dispassionate account of Hinduism given by Al-Biruni was remarkable for its time. He stated that he was fully objective in his writings, remaining unbiased like a proper historian should. Biruni documented everything about India just as it happened. But, he did note how some of the accounts of information that he was given by natives of the land may not have been reliable in terms of complete accuracy, however, he did try to be as honest as possible in his writing.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Mohammad Yasin compares it to \"a magic island of quiet, impartial research in the midst of a world of clashing swords, burning towns, and plundered temples.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Yasin|first1=Mohammad|title=Reading in Indian history|date=1988|publisher=Atlantic Publishers & Distri|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=978-8-1715-6120-9|pages=19|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hz4LJu1EqJIC|page=5}}|accessdate=22 June 2016}}</ref>\nBiruni's writing was very poetic, which may diminish some of the historical value of the work for modern times.
