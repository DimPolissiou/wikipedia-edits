Staging usually follows the first transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). Papillary tumors confined to the mucosa or which invade the [[lamina propria]] are classified as Ta or T1. Flat lesion are classified as Tis. Both are grouped together as non-muscle invasive disease for therapeutic purposes.\n\nIn the [[TNM staging system]] (8th Edn. 2017) for bladder cancer:<ref>{{cite web |title=EAU Guidelines - STAGING AND CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS |url=https://uroweb.org/guideline/non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/#4 |website=Uroweb}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Magers MJ, Lopez-Beltran A, Montironi R, Williamson SR, Kaimakliotis HZ, Cheng L | title = Staging of bladder cancer | journal = Histopathology | volume = 74 | issue = 1 | pages = 112\u2013134 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 30565300 | doi = 10.1111/his.13734 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n'''T (Primary tumour)'''\n* '''TX''' Primary tumour cannot be assessed\n* '''T0''' No evidence of primary tumour\n*'''Ta''' Non-invasive papillary carcinoma\n* '''Tis''' Carcinoma in situ ('flat tumour')\n* '''T1''' Tumour invades subepithelial connective tissue\n* '''T2a''' Tumour invades superficial muscle (inner half)\n* '''T2b''' Tumour invades deep muscle (outer half)\n* '''T3''' Tumour invades perivesical tissue:\n** '''T3a''' Microscopically\n** '''T3b''' Macroscopically (extravesical mass)\n* '''T4a''' Tumour invades [[prostate]], [[uterus]] or [[vagina]]\n* '''T4b''' Tumour invades [[pelvic wall]] or [[abdominal wall]]\n\n'''N (Lymph nodes)'''\n\n* '''NX''' Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed\n* '''N0''' No regional lymph node metastasis\n* '''N1''' Metastasis in a single lymph node in true pelvis (hypogastric, obturator, [[External iliac lymph nodes|external iliac]], or presacral nodes)\n* '''N2''' Metastasis in multiple lymph nodes in true pelvis (hypogastric, obturator, external iliac, or presacral nodes)\n* '''N3''' Metastasis in [[Common iliac lymph nodes|common iliac lymph node]](s)\n\n'''M (Distant metastasis)'''\n\n* '''MX''' Distant metastasis cannot be assessed\n* '''M0''' No distant metastasis\n* '''M1''' Distant metastasis. \n**'''M1a:''' The cancer has spread only to lymph nodes outside of the pelvis.\n**'''M1b''': The cancer has spread other parts of the body.\n\nThe most common sites for bladder cancer metastases are the lymph nodes, bones, lung, liver, and [[peritoneum]].<ref name=\"ShinagareRamaiya2011\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shinagare AB, Ramaiya NH, Jagannathan JP, Fennessy FM, Taplin ME, Van den Abbeele AD | title = Metastatic pattern of bladder cancer: correlation with the characteristics of the primary tumor | journal = AJR.

He later expanded on this criticism in an article published in ''[[The Guardian]]'', saying \"I'm talking about that very specific, very artificial, very ''Today'' programme format of a presenter acting as referee between two people who have been chosen to represent the opposing sides of a manufactured argument.

The programme features interviews with several of the UK's most successful television comedy writers and performers including [[Steve Coogan]], [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]], [[David Walliams]], [[Paul Whitehouse]], [[Griff Rhys Jones]] and [[Ardal O'Hanlon]], all of whom have worked with Linehan. It was directed by Adrian McCarthy and produced by Martha O'Neill and Adam Rynne. In 2011, Linehan also appeared with several members of the cast in [[Channel 4]]'s ''Father Ted Night'', an evening of the writer's favourite episodes and two retrospective documentaries.\n\n===Radio appearances===\n\nOn 6 June 2011, Linehan appeared on BBC Radio 4's ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme to discuss [[The Ladykillers (play)|his adaptation]] of the Ealing comedy film ''[[The Ladykillers]]'' for the West End stage. During this appearance, Linehan took issue with ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' presenter [[Justin Webb]] over what he saw as the attempted staging of an artificial argument between himself and the critic [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]]. He later expanded on this criticism in an article published in ''[[The Guardian]]'', saying \"I'm talking about that very specific, very artificial, very ''Today'' programme format of a presenter acting as referee between two people who have been chosen to represent the opposing sides of a manufactured argument. It is a binary view of politics, of life and, as a result, it is also a dishonest one.
