The song went to number one on both the Flanders and Wallonia Ultratop charts. Performing in the first semi final of the competition, Nottet was successful in progressing to the final, coming second in his semi final with 149 points. During the Jury Final (following Australia), he could be barely seen on stage due to heavy use of smoke machines and pyrotechnics from the Australian Act. His delegation was rumoured to have lodged a complaint about this, saying that it would affect part of their final score. While they requested to perform again, this was apparently denied, instead telling juries to disregard the smoke. In the Grand Final, the Belgian entry scored a total of 217 points leaving \"[[Rhythm Inside (Lo\u00efc Nottet song)|Rhythm Inside]]\" in fourth position overall, giving Belgium its first top five placement since 2003. It received the maximum 12 points from three countries; Netherlands, France and Hungary. The song was certified Platinum for selling 30,000 copies in Belgium. Nottet has released three different music videos for Rhythm Inside (including one called the \"Alice in Nightmareland\" version). After the contest, \"[[Rhythm Inside (Lo\u00efc Nottet song)|Rhythm Inside]]\" reached the top ten in the Austrian, Lithuanian and Russian Music Charts, achieving top 20 in Finland, Iceland and Sweden and also charting in Australia, UK, France, Switzerland and many more European countries.\n\nLoic has sung at NJR park Uitmarkt Symphonica.

The song went to number one on both the Flanders and Wallonia Ultratop charts. Performing in the first semi final of the competition, Nottet was successful in progressing to the final, coming second in his semi final with 149 points. During the Jury Final (following Australia), he could be barely seen on stage due to heavy use of smoke machines and pyrotechnics from the Australian Act. His delegation was rumoured to have lodged a complaint about this, saying that it would affect part of their final score. While they requested to perform again, this was apparently denied, instead telling juries to disregard the smoke. In the Grand Final, the Belgian entry scored a total of 217 points leaving \"[[Rhythm Inside (Lo\u00efc Nottet song)|Rhythm Inside]]\" in fourth position overall, giving Belgium its first top five placement since 2003. It received the maximum 12 points from three countries; Netherlands, France and Hungary. The song was certified Platinum for selling 30,000 copies in Belgium. Nottet has released three different music videos for Rhythm Inside (including one called the \"Alice in Nightmareland\" version). After the contest, \"[[Rhythm Inside (Lo\u00efc Nottet song)|Rhythm Inside]]\" reached the top ten in the Austrian, Lithuanian and Russian Music Charts, achieving top 20 in Finland, Iceland and Sweden and also charting in Australia, UK, France, Switzerland and many more European countries.\n\nLoic has sung at NJR park Uitmarkt Symphonica.

Venturi did nonetheless manage to continue in production for nearly sixteen years, declaring bankruptcy in 2000. In 2001, Monegasque [[Gildo Pallanca Pastor]] purchased Venturi, and decided to focus on electric-powered engines. This change of direction led to the limited-production [[Venturi F\u00e9tish|F\u00e9tish]].\n\nIn December 2009, Venturi announced its acquisition of French motorcycle manufacturer [[Voxan]]. The acquisition would effectively allow Venturi to enter the motorcycle market. In August 2011, Venturi announced the creation of Venturi North America, based in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. Venturi North America was primarily created as a research and development center, and as such, maintains a close working relationship with the Center for Automotive Research.\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Venturi 300 Atlantique 3.4 front.jpg|thumb|left|[[Venturi Atlantique|Venturi 300 Atlantique]]]]\nThe first Venturi came out in 1984, created by Claude Poiraud and G\u00e9rard Godfroy, two former engineers at [[Heuliez]]. The goal was to present the only \"[[grand tourer|Grand Tourisme]]\" French car capable of competing with the English [[Aston Martin]], the Italian [[Ferrari]], and the German [[Porsche]]. The first car shown had a [[Volkswagen Golf]] GTi engine and the name was originally spelled \"Ventury\", with a \"y\" at the end. In 1985, the car was shown with a {{convert|200|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Peugeot 505]] Turbo engine, but by the 1986 [[Paris Motor Show]] it had reached its definitive form with the [[PRV engine|PRV V6]] engine. Production began in 1987, with five cars built in the first year with production increasing in the subsequent years. The headquarters of the company was located in [[Cou\u00ebron]], [[Pays de Loire]], where almost 750 cars were produced in the forthcoming 20 years.\n\n[[File:Venturi 260 LM, \u00be front.jpg|thumb|right|Venturi 260 LM]]\nFrom 1987 to the mid-1990s, they built mid-engined [[coup\u00e9s]] and [[Roadster (automobile)|roadsters]] with [[turbocharged]] [[PRV engine]]s and [[Renault]] [[gearboxes]]. Engine power ranged from {{convert|200|to|260|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the then offered MVS Venturi Coup\u00e9 and Transcup series. The naturally aspirated Venturi 160 used the catalyzed 2849&nbsp;cc version of the PRV V6; this was meant to be sold in Japan and was therefore also available with an automatic transmsission. Only a handful were built. There was also the {{convert|185|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} Venturi 180, mainly developed for Italy, which used the turbocharged 1995-cc inline-four [[Douvrin engine]] from the [[Renault 21#Turbo|Renault 21 Turbo]].\n\nVenturi was also briefly involved with the [[Larrousse]] [[Formula One]] team. The team's 1992 car, which bore the Venturi name, was designed and built by Venturi Larousse UK, a British company formerly known as Fomet 1, which had previously designed the 1991 [[Fondmetal]] Formula One cars.<ref>{{cite book | last = Henry | first = Alan | title = Autocourse: the World's Leading Grand Prix Annual 1992-93 | publisher = Motorbooks Intl | page=83 | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-905138-96-1 }}</ref>\n[[File:Venturi 400GT S\u00e9rie 2 rear.jpg|thumb|left|Venturi 400 GT rear view]]\n[[File:Venturi_400_GT_Red.jpg|thumb|right|Venturi 400 GT]]\nThe Venturi 400 GT remains one of the highest performing French cars ever produced, and it is in fact the very first car in the world to have standard carbon brakes.<ref name=collector04>{{cite web | url = http://www.automobile-sportive.com/guide/venturi/400gt.php | title = Guide d'achat: Venturi 400-GT | trans-title = Buyers' Guide | publisher = l'Automobile Sportive | first = Nicolas | last = Liszewski | language = French | date = 2004-12-23 |accessdate = 7 March 2018}}</ref> True to that claim, the Atlantique 400 GT with a {{cvt|2975|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} [[Overhead camshaft#Dual overhead camshaft|DOHC]] [[Multi-valve#Four-valve cylinder head|4 valve]]s per cylinder [[twin-turbo]] [[V6 engine]] rated at {{convert|300|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6000 rpm and {{convert|520|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4500&nbsp;rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] with a [[compression ratio]] of 7.3:1, <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supercars.net/blog/1995-venturi-400gt/|website=supercars.net|title=1995 Venturi 400GT|editor=NIck D|date=December 20, 2015|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref> delivered excellent performance to put it on par with Ferraris of the early 90s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The 400 GT could hit {{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} in 4.7 seconds and {{convert|291|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} top speed, while the [[Venturi Atlantique#Atlantique 300 Biturbo|Atlantique 300 Biturbo]] with a {{convert|310|PS|bhp kW|0|abbr=on}} V6 could accelerate from 0-{{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} in 4.7 seconds and could reach a top speed of {{convert|275|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}}. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-sportive.com/guide/venturi/atlantique300.php|website=automobile-sportive.com|title=VENTURI ATLANTIQUE-300 (1996 - 2000)|editor=S\u00e9bastien Dupuis|language=fr-fr|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Venturi Transcup 210.jpg|thumb|left|Venturi Transcup 210]]\nA limited-edition 400 GTR was built to satisfy the [[homologation]] requirements to compete [[24 Hours of Le Mans]].

This was only the most recent post-war attempt at building a sporty luxury car in France, following in the footsteps of [[Facel Vega]], [[Monica (automobile)|Monica]], and [[Ligier]].<ref name=\"Retroviseur302\">{{cite journal | journal = R\u00e9troviseur | title = Requiem pour un nom | trans-title = Requiem for a name | language = French | last = Decker | first = Jean-Paul | page = 70 | ref = XCrv |date= July 2014 | number = 302 | publisher = \u00c9ditions LVA | location = Fontainebleu, France | issn = 0992-5007 }}</ref> As with its predecessors, Venturi was immediately faced with many challenges ranging from an unknown name to its under-capitalized and under-staffed state. Venturi did nonetheless manage to continue in production for nearly sixteen years, declaring bankruptcy in 2000. In 2001, Monegasque [[Gildo Pallanca Pastor]] purchased Venturi, and decided to focus on electric-powered engines. This change of direction led to the limited-production [[Venturi F\u00e9tish|F\u00e9tish]].\n\nIn December 2009, Venturi announced its acquisition of French motorcycle manufacturer [[Voxan]]. The acquisition would effectively allow Venturi to enter the motorcycle market. In August 2011, Venturi announced the creation of Venturi North America, based in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. Venturi North America was primarily created as a research and development center, and as such, maintains a close working relationship with the Center for Automotive Research.\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Venturi 300 Atlantique 3.4 front.jpg|thumb|left|[[Venturi Atlantique|Venturi 300 Atlantique]]]]\nThe first Venturi came out in 1984, created by Claude Poiraud and G\u00e9rard Godfroy, two former engineers at [[Heuliez]]. The goal was to present the only \"[[grand tourer|Grand Tourisme]]\" French car capable of competing with the English [[Aston Martin]], the Italian [[Ferrari]], and the German [[Porsche]]. The first car shown had a [[Volkswagen Golf]] GTi engine and the name was originally spelled \"Ventury\", with a \"y\" at the end. In 1985, the car was shown with a {{convert|200|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Peugeot 505]] Turbo engine, but by the 1986 [[Paris Motor Show]] it had reached its definitive form with the [[PRV engine|PRV V6]] engine. Production began in 1987, with five cars built in the first year with production increasing in the subsequent years. The headquarters of the company was located in [[Cou\u00ebron]], [[Pays de Loire]], where almost 750 cars were produced in the forthcoming 20 years.\n\n[[File:Venturi 260 LM, \u00be front.jpg|thumb|right|Venturi 260 LM]]\nFrom 1987 to the mid-1990s, they built mid-engined [[coup\u00e9s]] and [[Roadster (automobile)|roadsters]] with [[turbocharged]] [[PRV engine]]s and [[Renault]] [[gearboxes]]. Engine power ranged from {{convert|200|to|260|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the then offered MVS Venturi Coup\u00e9 and Transcup series. The naturally aspirated Venturi 160 used the catalyzed 2849&nbsp;cc version of the PRV V6; this was meant to be sold in Japan and was therefore also available with an automatic transmsission. Only a handful were built. There was also the {{convert|185|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} Venturi 180, mainly developed for Italy, which used the turbocharged 1995-cc inline-four [[Douvrin engine]] from the [[Renault 21#Turbo|Renault 21 Turbo]].\n\nVenturi was also briefly involved with the [[Larrousse]] [[Formula One]] team. The team's 1992 car, which bore the Venturi name, was designed and built by Venturi Larousse UK, a British company formerly known as Fomet 1, which had previously designed the 1991 [[Fondmetal]] Formula One cars.<ref>{{cite book | last = Henry | first = Alan | title = Autocourse: the World's Leading Grand Prix Annual 1992-93 | publisher = Motorbooks Intl | page=83 | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-905138-96-1 }}</ref>\n[[File:Venturi 400GT S\u00e9rie 2 rear.jpg|thumb|left|Venturi 400 GT rear view]]\n[[File:Venturi_400_GT_Red.jpg|thumb|right|Venturi 400 GT]]\nThe Venturi 400 GT remains one of the highest performing French cars ever produced, and it is in fact the very first car in the world to have standard carbon brakes.<ref name=collector04>{{cite web | url = http://www.automobile-sportive.com/guide/venturi/400gt.php | title = Guide d'achat: Venturi 400-GT | trans-title = Buyers' Guide | publisher = l'Automobile Sportive | first = Nicolas | last = Liszewski | language = French | date = 2004-12-23 |accessdate = 7 March 2018}}</ref> True to that claim, the Atlantique 400 GT with a {{cvt|2975|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} [[Overhead camshaft#Dual overhead camshaft|DOHC]] [[Multi-valve#Four-valve cylinder head|4 valve]]s per cylinder [[twin-turbo]] [[V6 engine]] rated at {{convert|300|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6000 rpm and {{convert|520|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4500&nbsp;rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] with a [[compression ratio]] of 7.3:1, <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supercars.net/blog/1995-venturi-400gt/|website=supercars.net|title=1995 Venturi 400GT|editor=NIck D|date=December 20, 2015|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref> delivered excellent performance to put it on par with Ferraris of the early 90s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The 400 GT could hit {{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} in 4.7 seconds and {{convert|291|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} top speed, while the [[Venturi Atlantique#Atlantique 300 Biturbo|Atlantique 300 Biturbo]] with a {{convert|310|PS|bhp kW|0|abbr=on}} V6 could accelerate from 0-{{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} in 4.7 seconds and could reach a top speed of {{convert|275|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}}. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-sportive.com/guide/venturi/atlantique300.php|website=automobile-sportive.com|title=VENTURI ATLANTIQUE-300 (1996 - 2000)|editor=S\u00e9bastien Dupuis|language=fr-fr|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Venturi Transcup 210.jpg|thumb|left|Venturi Transcup 210]]\nA limited-edition 400 GTR was built to satisfy the [[homologation]] requirements to compete [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]. High-level competition has also brought fame to the brand. St\u00e9phane Ratel, who would later found the [[FIA GT Championship]], was at the origin of the Venturi Gentlemen Drivers Trophy, which gathered an impressive array of 75 drivers. Venturi has also won fame through its brilliant performances in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], particularly in 1993 with [[Christophe Dechavanne]] and [[Jacques Laffite]] on Venturi Jaccadi team, and in 1995 with [[Paul Belmondo]] racing on the 600 SLM.\n\nHowever, it was in the [[BPR Global GT Series]] races that Venturi established its pedigree defeating Porsche and Ferrari on several occasions. In 1994 in [[Dijon-Prenois]], with Fert\u00e9 and Neugarten on the 600 LM Jaccadi, at the 1000&nbsp;km of Paris with [[Henri Pescarolo]] and Jean-Claude Basso on the 600 LM, and finally at the 4 Hours Spa race, once again with Michel Fert\u00e9 and Michel Neugarten.\n\n== Revival ==\n\n[[Image:Stand Venturi Mondial 2006.jpg|thumb|240x240px|[[Venturi F\u00e9tish]] at the 2006 [[Paris Motor Show]]]]\n\nIn 2001, the [[Monaco|Monegasque]] millionaire [[Gildo Pallanca Pastor]] bought Venturi and decided to focus on electric-powered engines,<ref>[http://business.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/16/electrifying-ideas-to-give-monaco-a-new-spark/ Electrifying ideas to give Monaco a new spark, at business.blogs.cnn.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017115946/http://business.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/16/electrifying-ideas-to-give-monaco-a-new-spark/ |date=October 17, 2012 }} accessed 7 March 2018</ref> leading to the [[Venturi F\u00e9tish|F\u00e9tish]] model.

It is the first spinosaurid reported from Asia and is known only from tooth [[Fossil|fossils]]; the first of which were found in the [[Sao Khua Formation]], with more teeth later recovered from the younger [[Khok Kruat Formation]]. The [[type species]] '''''Siamosaurus suteethorni''''', whose name honours the Thai [[palaeontologist]] [[Varavudh Suteethorn]], was formally described in [[1986 in paleontology|1986]]. One tooth possibly belonging to the genus was discovered in the Japanese [[Sebayashi Formation]] in 1994, and a tooth similar to it was found at the same site in 2015. In 2009, four teeth from China's [[Xinlong Formation]] were assigned to the spinosaurid species ''[[\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis]]'', which may be the same animal as ''Siamosaurus''. Most of the aforementioned teeth were originally attributed to [[Marine reptile|marine reptiles]]. A partial spinosaurid skeleton from the Khok Kruat Formation was described in 2007, but whether it belongs to ''Siamosaurus'' or not is unclear.\n\nThe [[holotype]] tooth is {{Convert|62.5|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.6 by 12.5|mm|}} wide at the base. Since it is a tooth taxon, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s body size and weight are uncertain, though it has been estimated at between {{Convert|5.1 to 9.1|m||abbr=}} and weighing {{Convert|1|tonne|short ton}}. ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight, oval to circular in cross section, and lined with distinct lengthwise ridges. The tooth's [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] was wrinkled, similar to that of teeth from the related genus ''[[Baryonyx]]''. ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s identity has been questioned by many palaeontologists, who argue that its teeth are too similar to those of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles for it to be confidently classed as a dinosaur. Other researchers, who agree that the teeth are spinosaur in origin, deem them too similar to those of other Early Cretaceous spinosaurs to unequivocally raise a new genus. Based on characteristics of its teeth, ''Siamosaurus'' has been placed within the [[Spinosaurinae]] [[subfamily]].\n\nLike all spinosaurids, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth were conical, with reduced or absent [[Serration|serrations]]. This made them suitable for impaling rather than tearing flesh, a trait typically seen in largely [[piscivorous]] (fish-eating) animals. Its relatives are known to have also consumed [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] and small to medium-sized dinosaurs, and there is fossil evidence of ''Siamosaurus'' eating [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs, either via scavenging or hunting. ''Siamosaurus'' lived in a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] habitat of [[Floodplain|floodplains]] and meandering rivers, where it coexisted with other theropod, sauropod, and (in at least the Khok Kruat Formation) [[Iguanodontia|iguanodontian]] dinosaurs. [[Isotope analysis]] indicates spinosaurids may have had [[semiaquatic]] habits, and ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s role as a piscivorous predator might have reduced the prominence of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles.\n\n== History of discovery ==\n[[File:Cretaceous_strata_in_northeast_and_southeastern_Thailand.png|thumb|left|Geological map of the [[Khorat Plateau]] in northeast Thailand]]\n\nThe [[Sao Khua Formation]], where the first ''Siamosaurus'' [[Fossil|fossils]] were discovered, is part of the [[Khorat Group]].<ref name=\":0\">Buffetaut, E.; and Ingevat, R.

The tooth is relatively straight, with only minor front to back curvature. It is oval in cross section while other specimens are nearly circular in this aspect.

It is unknown on which jaw the tooth was positioned nor which surface faced the inside or outside of the mouth. The tooth's front and back carinae are well-defined, though the former is not well preserved. Besides having a broader, {{Convert|20 by 14|mm||adj=on}} wide base and being slightly smaller at {{Convert|51|mm|}} in length, GMNH-PV-999 has a very similar morphology to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype. Features shared between the two specimens include: a straight and only slightly compressed shape; a somewhat oval cross section; no serrations on the carinae (possibly due to bad preservation); and a flutes on the crown surface, the Japan specimen having 12 on each side. The specimens also share a crown surface with numerous small granular structures oriented parallel to their lengths. Because of these resemblances, Hasegawa and colleagues regarded GMNH-PV-999 as nearly identical to DMR TF 2043a.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n[[File:Sebayashi_spinosaurid_teeth.png|thumb|left|Partial tooth of an indeterminate spinosaurid (KDC-PV-0003) and possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth (GMNH-PV-999), in the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]], Tokyo]]\n\nKDC-PV-0003, the second tooth found in the Sebayashi Formation, consists of a slightly recurved crown fragment with a preserved length of {{Convert|10|mm|}}. At its base, the crown is {{Convert|7.4|mm|}} long and {{Convert|6.8|mm|}} wide, with an almost circular cross section. Though less complete than the former specimens, KDC-PV-0003 exhibits better preservation of small details such as visible serrations, although poorly defined ones. The denticles, of which there are two to three every {{Convert|1|mm||adj=on}}, are visible only on the front carinae, due to the rear of the tooth being obscured by rock [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. A {{Convert|5.5|mm||adj=on}} long gap at the fossil's base exposes the dentine, which is covered in a {{Convert|1.6|mm||adj=on}} thick layer of enamel.

The granular structures of KDC-PV-0003 are sharper than in GMNH-PV-999. The interdenticle sulci (tiny furrows near the gaps between each denticle) of KDC-PV-0003 have an [[Oblique angle|oblique]] orientation of 45 degrees, exactly like those seen in GMNH-PV-999.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOut of the four teeth referred to ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis'', specimen [[IVPP]] V 4793 is the most intact, although still somewhat deformed. The crown, which is missing its tip, is {{Convert|69|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.5 by 13|mm|}} wide at the base. The tooth is straight, only slightly recurved, and has an oval cross section. The front and rear carinae are distinct, though their serrations have been heavily eroded, similar to those of KDC-PV-0003. Like the Thailand and Japan teeth, the ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis'' specimens bear developed flutes and a granular surface. As in both Sebayashi Formation teeth, there are 12 flutes on each face of ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis''{{'}}s teeth. Like in KDC-PV-0003, thee flutes of varied lengths. Buffetaut and colleagues likened them most to those of ''Siamosaurus'', with respect to their identical crown shape, fluting, and granular enamel.<ref name=\"EBetal082\" />\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:Spinosaurus_sp_Marocco_Cenom.JPG|thumb|Tooth of the related genus ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', Museo di Storia Naturale A. Stoppani, [[Lombardy]]]]\n\nIn 1986, Buffetaut and Ingavat classified ''Siamosaurus'' as a theropod because of the straight tall crown and double lateral recurvature of its teeth. At the time, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s particular combination of dental characteristics, especially the longitudinal fluting and lack of serrations, had not been observed in other theropods. The authors noted similarities in ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth to those of [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaurian]] tooth crowns, some of which also have longitudinal flutes. However, this identification was ruled out, since ceratosaur teeth differ in cross section, bear far fewer dental flutes, and have distinct serrations. Buffetaut and Suteethorn concluded that the closest taxon in dentition to ''Siamosaurus'' was ''Spinosaurus''. Like ''Siamosaurus,'' this African genus had straight and unserrated conical teeth, and though ''Spinosaurus'' lacked the developed flutes seen in ''Siamosaurus,'' Buffetaut and Ingavat noted that both smooth and fluted spinosaur teeth have been reported from Africa. Therefore, they tentatively placed ''Siamosaurus'' in the Spinosauridae [[Family (biology)|family]], based on close similarities in dentition to ''Spinosaurus aegyptiacus.<ref name=\":0\" />''<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nMany palaeontologists have expressed skepticism towards Buffetaut and Ingavat's identification of ''Siamosaurus'', given that spinosaurid teeth, including many from Asia, have been time and again mistaken for those of aquatic reptiles like crocodilians, plesiosaurs, and ichthyosaurs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Buffetaut|first=Eric|date=2010-01-01|title=Spinosaurs before Stromer: early finds of spinosaurid dinosaurs and their interpretations|url=http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/343/1/175|journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications|language=en|volume=343|issue=1|pages=175\u2013188|bibcode=2010GSLSP.343..175B|doi=10.1144/SP343.10|issn=0305-8719}}</ref> In view of this, the German palaeontologist [[Hans-Dieter Sues]] and colleagues in 2002 argued that there is not enough material to confidently identify ''Siamosaurus'' as a dinosaur.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sues|first=Hans-Dieter|last2=Frey|first2=Eberhard|last3=Martill|first3=David M.|last4=Scott|first4=Diane M.|date=2002-09-19|title=Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|language=en|volume=22|issue=3|pages=535\u2013547|doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2002)022[0535:icasdt]2.0.co;2|issn=0272-4634}}</ref> In 2004, American palaeontologist [[Thomas Holtz]] and colleagues considered it a [[nomen dubium|''nomen dubium'']] (dubious name), stating that its teeth might instead belong to contemporaneous fish such as [[saurodontid]] or [[Ichthyodectidae|ichthyodectid]] [[Teleost|teleosts]].<ref name=\"HMC04\">Holtz Jr., T.R., Molnar, R.E., and Currie, P.J.

In this study, the teeth of ''Siamosaurus'' and a Morrocan spinosaurid were compared to those of crocodilians using [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]]. Lauprasert found that spinosaurids and crocodilians may have employed similar feeding tactics and been under comparable [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|mechanical constraints]], based on resemblances in the [[microstructure]] of their tooth enamel. Lauprasert suggested that ''Siamosaurus'' could have therefore replaced the [[ecological niche]] of contemporaneous long-snouted crocodilians as a piscivorous predator. He notes that this likely occured in correlation with the rising aridity of the Sao Khua and Khok Kruat Formations during the Early Cretaceous, since ''Siamosaurus'' had better mobility in a dry environment than crocodilians did. This could explain the absence of long-snouted crocodilian fossils from that time and place.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite thesis|last=Lauprasert|first=Komsorn|title=Evolution and palaeoecology of crocodiles in the mesozoic of Khorat plateau, Thailand|date=2006|publisher=Chulalongkorn University|url=https://cuir.car.chula.ac.th/handle/123456789/14411|language=en}}</ref> A similar scenario was proposed for spinosaurids by Hone and colleagues in 2010, who noted that, compared to large crocodilians and obligate aquatic predators, they could more easily travel from one body of water to another in search for prey.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\n=== Aquatic habits ===\n\nA 2010 publication by French palaeontologist Romain Amiot and colleagues found that the [[isotopes of oxygen|oxygen isotope]] ratios of spinosaurid bones indicated [[semiaquatic]] lifestyles. Isotope ratios of spinosaurid teeth from various localities, including Thailand, were compared with isotopic compositions from contemporaneous theropods, turtles, and crocodilians. The study revealed that, among theropods, spinosaurid isotope ratios were closer to those of turtles and crocodilians. Thai spinosaurid teeth tended to have the largest difference from the ratios of other theropods, and those from Morocco tended to have the least difference. The authors concluded that spinosaurids, like modern crocodilians and hippopotamuses, spent much of their daily lives in or near water. They also suggested that semiaquatic habits and piscivory may explain how spinosaurids coexisted with other large theropods; by feeding on different prey items and occupying a distinct ecological niche, the different types of theropods would have been out of direct competition.<ref name=\"RMetal10\">{{cite journal |last=Amiot |first=R. |author2=Buffetaut, E. |author3=L\u00e9cuyer, C. |author4=Wang, X. |author5=Boudad, L. |author6=Ding, Z. |author7=Fourel, F. |author8=Hutt, S. |author9=Martineau, F. |author10=Medeiros, A. |author11=Mo, J. |author12=Simon, L. |author13=Suteethorn, V. |author14=Sweetman, S. |author15=Tong, H. |author16=Zhang, F. |author17=Zhou, Z. |year=2010 |title=Oxygen isotope evidence for semi-aquatic habits among spinosaurid theropods |journal=Geology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=139\u2013142 |doi=10.1130/G30402.1|bibcode=2010Geo....38..139A }}</ref>\n\n== Palaeoenvironment and palaeobiogeography ==\n[[File:Sao_Khua_Formation_V2.png|thumb|left|Restoration of ''Siamosaurus'' hunting fish in the Sao Khua Formation, with a herd of ''[[Phuwiangosaurus]]'' in the background]]\n\nThe sediments of the Sao Khua Formation, composed of [[Red clay|red clays]], [[Mudstone|mudstones]], [[Sandstone|sandstones]], [[Siltstone|siltstones]] and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] rocks, record a [[fluvial]] environment dominated by lakes, [[Floodplain|floodplains]], and meandering low-energy rivers.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Eric|first=Buffetaut|last2=Varavudh|first2=Suteethorn|date=1998|title=The biogeographical significance of the Mesozoic vertebrates from Thailand|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/15441|journal=Biogeography and Geological Evolution of SE Asia|language=en}}</ref> This is consistent with the types of vertebrate fauna present in the formation, which comprise only terrestrial or freshwater animals, including dinosaurs, turtles, freshwater [[hybodont sharks]] and [[Actinopterygii|actinopterygian]] fishes, and the freshwater crocodilian ''[[Sunosuchus]]'' (previously referred to ''[[Goniopholis]]''<ref name=\"AEBS11\">{{Cite journal|last1=De Andrade|first1=M.

It is the first spinosaurid reported from Asia and is known only from tooth [[Fossil|fossils]]; the first of which were found in the [[Sao Khua Formation]], with more teeth later recovered from the younger [[Khok Kruat Formation]]. The [[type species]] '''''Siamosaurus suteethorni''''', whose name honours the Thai [[palaeontologist]] [[Varavudh Suteethorn]], was formally described in [[1986 in paleontology|1986]]. One tooth possibly belonging to the genus was discovered in the Japanese [[Sebayashi Formation]] in 1994, and a tooth similar to it was found at the same site in 2015. In 2009, four teeth from China's [[Xinlong Formation]] were assigned to the spinosaurid species ''[[\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis]]'', which may be the same animal as ''Siamosaurus''. Most of the aforementioned teeth were originally attributed to [[Marine reptile|marine reptiles]]. A partial spinosaurid skeleton from the Khok Kruat Formation was described in 2007, but whether it belongs to ''Siamosaurus'' or not is unclear.\n\nThe [[holotype]] tooth is {{Convert|62.5|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.6 by 12.5|mm|}} wide at the base. Since it is a tooth taxon, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s body size and weight are uncertain, though it has been estimated at between {{Convert|5.1 to 9.1|m||abbr=}} and weighing {{Convert|1|tonne|short ton}}. ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight, oval to circular in cross section, and lined with distinct lengthwise ridges. The tooth's [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] was wrinkled, similar to that of teeth from the related genus ''[[Baryonyx]]''. ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s identity has been questioned by many palaeontologists, who argue that its teeth are too similar to those of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles for it to be confidently classed as a dinosaur. Other researchers, who agree that the teeth are spinosaur in origin, deem them too similar to those of other Early Cretaceous spinosaurs to unequivocally raise a new genus. Based on characteristics of its teeth, ''Siamosaurus'' has been placed within the [[Spinosaurinae]] [[subfamily]].\n\nLike all spinosaurids, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth were conical, with reduced or absent [[Serration|serrations]].

Though less complete than the former specimens, KDC-PV-0003 exhibits better preservation of small details such as visible serrations, although poorly defined ones. The denticles, of which there are two to three every {{Convert|1|mm||adj=on}}, are visible only on the front carinae, due to the rear of the tooth being obscured by rock [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. A {{Convert|5.5|mm||adj=on}} long gap at the fossil's base exposes the dentine, which is covered in a {{Convert|1.6|mm||adj=on}} thick layer of enamel. The little that is preserved of KDC-PV-0003 shows that like the first Sebayashi Formation tooth, it has a granular texture and a minimum of 12 flutes on its surface, not all of which stretch to the full length of the crown. The granular structures of KDC-PV-0003 are sharper than in GMNH-PV-999. The interdenticle sulci (tiny furrows near the gaps between each denticle) of KDC-PV-0003 have an [[Oblique angle|oblique]] orientation of 45 degrees, exactly like those seen in GMNH-PV-999.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOut of the four teeth referred to ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis'', specimen [[IVPP]] V 4793 is the most intact, although still somewhat deformed. The crown, which is missing its tip, is {{Convert|69|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.5 by 13|mm|}} wide at the base. The tooth is straight, only slightly recurved, and has an oval cross section. The front and rear carinae are distinct, though their serrations have been heavily eroded, similar to those of KDC-PV-0003. Like the Thailand and Japan teeth, the ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis'' specimens bear developed flutes and a granular surface. As in both Sebayashi Formation teeth, there are 12 flutes on each face of ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis''{{'}}s teeth. Like in KDC-PV-0003, thee flutes of varied lengths.

Stoppani, [[Lombardy]]]]\n\nIn 1986, Buffetaut and Ingavat classified ''Siamosaurus'' as a theropod because of the straight tall crown and double lateral recurvature of its teeth. At the time, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s particular combination of dental characteristics, especially the longitudinal fluting and lack of serrations, had not been observed in other theropods. The authors noted similarities in ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth to those of [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaurian]] tooth crowns, some of which also have longitudinal flutes. However, this identification was ruled out, since ceratosaur teeth differ in cross section, bear far fewer dental flutes, and have distinct serrations. Buffetaut and Suteethorn concluded that the closest taxon in dentition to ''Siamosaurus'' was ''Spinosaurus''. Like ''Siamosaurus,'' this African genus had straight and unserrated conical teeth, and though ''Spinosaurus'' lacked the developed flutes seen in ''Siamosaurus,'' Buffetaut and Ingavat noted that both smooth and fluted spinosaur teeth have been reported from Africa.

Lauprasert found that spinosaurids and crocodilians may have employed similar feeding tactics and been under comparable [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|mechanical constraints]], based on resemblances in the [[microstructure]] of their tooth enamel.

Isotope ratios of spinosaurid teeth from various localities, including Thailand, were compared with isotopic compositions from contemporaneous theropods, turtles, and crocodilians. The study revealed that, among theropods, spinosaurid isotope ratios were closer to those of turtles and crocodilians. Thai spinosaurid teeth tended to have the largest difference from the ratios of other theropods, and those from Morocco tended to have the least difference. The authors concluded that spinosaurids, like modern crocodilians and hippopotamuses, spent much of their daily lives in or near water. They also suggested that semiaquatic habits and piscivory may explain how spinosaurids coexisted with other large theropods; by feeding on different prey items and occupying a distinct ecological niche, the different types of theropods would have been out of direct competition.<ref name=\"RMetal10\">{{cite journal |last=Amiot |first=R. |author2=Buffetaut, E. |author3=L\u00e9cuyer, C. |author4=Wang, X. |author5=Boudad, L. |author6=Ding, Z. |author7=Fourel, F. |author8=Hutt, S. |author9=Martineau, F. |author10=Medeiros, A. |author11=Mo, J. |author12=Simon, L. |author13=Suteethorn, V. |author14=Sweetman, S. |author15=Tong, H. |author16=Zhang, F. |author17=Zhou, Z. |year=2010 |title=Oxygen isotope evidence for semi-aquatic habits among spinosaurid theropods |journal=Geology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=139\u2013142 |doi=10.1130/G30402.1|bibcode=2010Geo....38..139A }}</ref>\n\n== Palaeoenvironment and palaeobiogeography ==\n[[File:Sao_Khua_Formation_V2.png|thumb|left|Restoration of ''Siamosaurus'' hunting fish in the Sao Khua Formation, with a herd of ''[[Phuwiangosaurus]]'' in the background]]\n\nThe sediments of the Sao Khua Formation, composed of [[Red clay|red clays]], [[Mudstone|mudstones]], [[Sandstone|sandstones]], [[Siltstone|siltstones]] and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] rocks, record a [[fluvial]] environment dominated by lakes, [[Floodplain|floodplains]], and meandering low-energy rivers.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Eric|first=Buffetaut|last2=Varavudh|first2=Suteethorn|date=1998|title=The biogeographical significance of the Mesozoic vertebrates from Thailand|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/15441|journal=Biogeography and Geological Evolution of SE Asia|language=en}}</ref> This is consistent with the types of vertebrate fauna present in the formation, which comprise only terrestrial or freshwater animals, including dinosaurs, turtles, freshwater [[hybodont sharks]] and [[Actinopterygii|actinopterygian]] fishes, and the freshwater crocodilian ''[[Sunosuchus]]'' (previously referred to ''[[Goniopholis]]''<ref name=\"AEBS11\">{{Cite journal|last1=De Andrade|first1=M.

Eno tore down the four-story St. Germaine Hotel on the south end of the lot, and replaced it with a seven-story apartment building, the Cumberland. On the remainder of the lot he built four three-story buildings for commercial use. This left four stories of the Cumberland's northern face exposed, which Eno rented out to advertisers, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', who installed a sign made up of electric lights. Eno later put a canvas screen on the wall, and projected images onto it from a [[magic lantern]] on top of one of his smaller buildings, presenting advertisements and interesting pictures alternately. Both the ''Times'' and the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' began using the screen for news bulletins, and on election nights tens of thousands of people would gather in Madison Square, waiting for the latest results.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pages=26-29}}\n\nDuring his life Eno resisted suggestions to sell \"Eno's flatiron\", as the site had become known, but after his death in 1899 his assets were liquidated, and the lot went up for sale. The [[New York State Assembly]] appropriated $3 million for the city to buy it, but this fell through when a newspaper reporter discovered that the plan was a [[Graft (politics)|graft]] scheme by [[Tammany Hall]] boss [[Richard Croker]]. Instead, the lot was bought at auction by William Eno, one of Amos's sons, for $690,000 \u2013 the elder Eno had bought the property for around $30,000 forty years earlier. Three weeks later, William re-sold the lot to [[Samuel Newhouse|Samuel]] and Mott Newhouse for $801,000. The Newhouses intended to put up a 12-story building with street-level retail shops and bachelor apartments above, but two years later they sold the lot for about $2 million to Cumberland Realty Company, an investment partnership created by [[Harry S. Black]], CEO of the [[Fuller Company]]. The Fuller Company was the first true [[general contractor]] that dealt with all aspects of building construction except design, and they specialized in building skyscrapers.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pages=29-41}}\n\nBlack intended to construct a new headquarters building on the site, despite the recent deterioration of the surrounding neighborhood,{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pages=29-41}} and he engaged Chicago architect [[Daniel Burnham]] to design it. The building, which would be Burnham's first in New York City,<ref name=treasure /> would also be the first skyscraper north of [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]].{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=60}} It was to be named the Fuller Building after [[George A.

The steel was so meticulously pre-cut that the frame went up at the rate of a floor each week. By February 1902 the frame was complete, and by mid-May the building was half-covered by terra-cotta tiling.

All, however, are smaller than their New York counterpart.\n\nTwo features were added to the Flatiron Building following its completion. The \"cowcatcher\" retail space at the front of the building was added in order to maximize the use of the building's lot and produce some retail income. Harry Black had insisted on the space, despite objections from Burnham.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=101-03}} Another addition to the building not in the original plan was the penthouse, which was constructed after the rest of the building had been completed to be used as artists' studios, and was quickly rented out to artists such as [[Louis Fancher]], many of whom contributed to the [[pulp magazine]]s which were produced in the offices below.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=201-02}}\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n[[File:Albert Gleizes Sur le Flat-iron 1916.jpg|thumb|225px|alt=Sur le Flatiron, Albert Gleizes, gouache and ink (1916)|''Sur le Flatiron'', [[Albert Gleizes]], gouache and ink (1916)|left]]\n\n===Initial response===\nThe Flatiron Building became an icon of New York City, and the public response to it was enthusiastic,<ref name=treasure /><ref>[[Witold Rybczynski|Rybczynski, Witold]].

[[Montgomery Schuyler]], editor of ''[[Architectural Record]]'', said that its \"awkwardness [is] entirely undisguised, and without even an attempt to disguise them, if they have not even been aggravated by the treatment. ... The treatment of the tip is an additional and it seems wanton aggravation of the inherent awkwardness of the situation.\"<ref>''[[Architectural Record]]'' (October 1902), quoted in Alexiou, pp. 125\u201326</ref> He praised the surface of the building, and the detailing of the terra-cotta work, but criticized the practicality of the large number of windows in the building: \"[The tenant] can, perhaps, find wall space within for one roll top desk without overlapping the windows, with light close in front of him and close behind him and close on one side of him. But suppose he needed a bookcase? Undoubtedly he has a highly eligible place from which to view processions. But for the transaction of business?\"{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=138}}\n\nWhen the building was first constructed, it received mixed feedback. The most known criticism received was known as \"Burnham's Folly\".

''(See [[#iconic images|below]])''{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=153-57}} Stieglitz reflected on the dynamic symbolism of the building, noting upon seeing it one day during a snowstorm that \"... it appeared to be moving toward me like the bow of a monster ocean steamer \u2013 a picture of a new America still in the making,\"<ref name=treasure /><ref>[http://magicalhystorytour.blogspot.com/2010/08/skyscrapers.html \"Skyscrapers\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629192827/http://magicalhystorytour.blogspot.com/2010/08/skyscrapers.html |date=June 29, 2015 }} ''Magical Hystory Tour:The Origins of the Commonplace & Curious in America'' (September 1, 2010)</ref><ref>Burns, Ric & Sanders, James ''New York: An Illustrated History'', 233(1999)</ref> and remarked that what the [[Parthenon]] was to Athens, the Flatiron was to New York.<ref name=wsjrev /> When Stieglitz' photograph was published in ''Camera Work'', his friend [[Sadakichi Hartmann]], a writer, painter and photographer, accompanied it with an essay on the building: \"A curious creation, no doubt, but can it be called beautiful?

In 1910, Harry Black moved the company to [[Francis H. Kimball|Francis Kimball]]'s [[Trinity Building]] at 111 Broadway, where its parent company, U.S. Realty, had its offices. U.S. Realty moved its offices back to the Flatiron in 1916, and left permanently for the [[Fuller Building]] on 57th Street in 1929.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=214, 244, 252}}\n\nThe Flatiron's other original tenants included publishers (magazine publishing pioneer [[Frank Munsey]], ''American Architect and Building News'' and a vanity publisher), an insurance company (the [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company|Equitable Life Assurance Society]]), small businesses (a patent medicine company, Western Specialty Manufacturing Company and Whitehead & Hoag, who made celluloid novelties), music publishers (overflow from \"[[Tin Pan Alley]]\" up on [[28th Street (Manhattan)|28th Street]]), a landscape architect, the [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] Consulate, the Bohemian Guides Society, the Roebling Construction Company, owned by the sons of [[Tammany Hall]] boss [[Richard Croker]], and the crime syndicate, [[Murder, Inc.]]<ref name=treasure />\n\nThe retail space in the [[Flatiron Building#Cowcatcher space|building's \"cowcatcher\"]] at the \"prow\" was leased by [[United Cigar Stores]], and the building's vast cellar, which extended into the vaults that went more than {{convert|20|ft|m}} under the surrounding streets,{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=89}} was occupied by the Flatiron Restaurant, which could seat 1,500 patrons and was open from breakfast through late supper for those taking in a performance at one of the many [[Rialto, Manhattan|theatres which lined Broadway between 14th and 23rd Streets]].{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=133-41}}\n\nIn 1911, the building introduced a restaurant/club in the basement. It was among the first of its kind that allowed a black Jazz band to perform, thus introducing [[ragtime]] to affluent New Yorkers.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010}}\n\nEven before construction on the Flatiron Building had begun, the area around [[Madison Square]] had started to deteriorate somewhat. After U.S. Realty constructed the [[New York Hippodrome]], [[Madison Square Garden II|Madison Square Garden]] was no longer the venue of choice, and survived largely by staging [[boxing]] matches. The base of the Flatiron became a cruising spot for gay men, including some male [[prostitutes]].{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=233}} Nonetheless, in 1911 the Flatiron Restaurant was bought by Louis Bustanoby, of the well-known Caf\u00e9 des Beaux-Arts, and converted into a trendy 400-seat French restaurant, Taverne Louis. As an innovation to attract customers away from another restaurant opened by his brothers, Bustanoby hired a black musical group, [[Louis Mitchell]] and his Southern Symphony Quintette, to play dance tunes at the Taverne and the Caf\u00e9. [[Irving Berlin]] heard the group at the Taverne and suggested that they should try to get work in London, which they did.{{efn-ua|Mitchell would later become a headliner and nightclub owner [[Paris]], becoming a millionaire before losing it all.

Black, in need of cash for his [[U.S. Realty Company]], sold the Flatiron Building to a syndicate set up by [[Lewis Rosenbaum]], who also owned assorted other notable buildings around the U.S. The price was $2 million, which equaled Black's cost for buying the lot and erecting the Flatiron.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=244-45}} The syndicate defaulted on its mortgage in 1933, and was taken over by the lender, [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company|Equitable Life Assurance Company]] after failing to sell it at auction. To attract tenants, Equitable did some modernization of the building, including replacing the original cast-iron birdcage elevators, which had cabs covered in rubber tiling and were originally built by [[Hecla Iron Works]], but the hydraulic power system was not replaced. By the mid-1940s, the building was fully rented.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=264-64}}\n\nWhen the U.S. entered [[World War I]], the Federal government instituted a \"Wake Up America!\" campaign, and the United Cigar store in the Flatiron's cowcatcher donated its space to the [[U.S. Navy]] for use as a recruiting center.

Though Burnham maintained overall control of the design process, he was not directly connected with the details of the structure as built. That task was performed by his designer [[Frederick P.

Black pushed Burnham hard for plans for the addition, but Burnham resisted because of the aesthetic effect it would have on the design of the \"prow\" of the building, where it would interrupt the two-story high Classical columns which were echoed at the top of the building by two columns which supported the cornice.

Eno tore down the four-story St. Germaine Hotel on the south end of the lot, and replaced it with a seven-story apartment building, the Cumberland. On the remainder of the lot he built four three-story buildings for commercial use. This left four stories of the Cumberland's northern face exposed, which Eno rented out to advertisers, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', who installed a sign made up of electric lights. Eno later put a canvas screen on the wall, and projected images onto it from a [[magic lantern]] on top of one of his smaller buildings, presenting advertisements and interesting pictures alternately. Both the ''Times'' and the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' began using the screen for news bulletins, and on election nights tens of thousands of people would gather in Madison Square, waiting for the latest results.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pages=26-29}}\n\nDuring his life Eno resisted suggestions to sell \"Eno's flatiron\", as the site had become known, but after his death in 1899 his assets were liquidated, and the lot went up for sale. The [[New York State Assembly]] appropriated $3 million for the city to buy it, but this fell through when a newspaper reporter discovered that the plan was a [[Graft (politics)|graft]] scheme by [[Tammany Hall]] boss [[Richard Croker]]. Instead, the lot was bought at auction by William Eno, one of Amos's sons, for $690,000 \u2013 the elder Eno had bought the property for around $30,000 forty years earlier. Three weeks later, William re-sold the lot to [[Samuel Newhouse|Samuel]] and Mott Newhouse for $801,000. The Newhouses intended to put up a 12-story building with street-level retail shops and bachelor apartments above, but two years later they sold the lot for about $2 million to Cumberland Realty Company, an investment partnership created by [[Harry S. Black]], CEO of the [[Fuller Company]]. The Fuller Company was the first true [[general contractor]] that dealt with all aspects of building construction except design, and they specialized in building skyscrapers.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pages=29-41}}\n\nBlack intended to construct a new headquarters building on the site, despite the recent deterioration of the surrounding neighborhood,{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pages=29-41}} and he engaged Chicago architect [[Daniel Burnham]] to design it. The building, which would be Burnham's first in New York City,<ref name=treasure /> would also be the first skyscraper north of [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]].{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=60}} It was to be named the Fuller Building after [[George A.

The steel was so meticulously pre-cut that the frame went up at the rate of a floor each week. By February 1902 the frame was complete, and by mid-May the building was half-covered by terra-cotta tiling. The building was completed in June 1902, after a year of construction.<ref name=treasure /> \n\nThe Flatiron Building was not the first building of its triangular ground-plan: aside from a possibly unique triangular Roman temple built on a similarly constricted site in the city of [[Verulamium|Verulamium, Britannia]],<ref>Noted, \"Roman city in Britain had Flatiron Building\", ''[[Science News|The Science News-Letter]]'' '''24''' No. 657 (November 11, 1933:311).</ref> the [[Historic Inns of Annapolis#The Maryland Inn|Maryland Inn]] in [[Annapolis]] (1782), the [[Hanover Square, Syracuse|Granger Block]] in [[Syracuse, New York]] (1869), the [[Phelan Building]] in [[San Francisco]] (1881), the [[Gooderham Building]] of [[Toronto]] (1892), and the [[English-American Building]] in [[Atlanta]] (1897) predate it. All, however, are smaller than their New York counterpart.\n\nTwo features were added to the Flatiron Building following its completion. The \"cowcatcher\" retail space at the front of the building was added in order to maximize the use of the building's lot and produce some retail income. Harry Black had insisted on the space, despite objections from Burnham.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=101-03}} Another addition to the building not in the original plan was the penthouse, which was constructed after the rest of the building had been completed to be used as artists' studios, and was quickly rented out to artists such as [[Louis Fancher]], many of whom contributed to the [[pulp magazine]]s which were produced in the offices below.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=201-02}}\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n[[File:Albert Gleizes Sur le Flat-iron 1916.jpg|thumb|225px|alt=Sur le Flatiron, Albert Gleizes, gouache and ink (1916)|''Sur le Flatiron'', [[Albert Gleizes]], gouache and ink (1916)|left]]\n\n===Initial response===\nThe Flatiron Building became an icon of New York City, and the public response to it was enthusiastic,<ref name=treasure /><ref>[[Witold Rybczynski|Rybczynski, Witold]].

Quote: \"The public loved the Flatiron, and businessmen and their architects took notice.\"</ref> but the critical response to it at the time was not completely positive, and what praise it garnered was often for the cleverness of the engineering involved. [[Montgomery Schuyler]], editor of ''[[Architectural Record]]'', said that its \"awkwardness [is] entirely undisguised, and without even an attempt to disguise them, if they have not even been aggravated by the treatment. ... The treatment of the tip is an additional and it seems wanton aggravation of the inherent awkwardness of the situation.\"<ref>''[[Architectural Record]]'' (October 1902), quoted in Alexiou, pp. 125\u201326</ref> He praised the surface of the building, and the detailing of the terra-cotta work, but criticized the practicality of the large number of windows in the building: \"[The tenant] can, perhaps, find wall space within for one roll top desk without overlapping the windows, with light close in front of him and close behind him and close on one side of him. But suppose he needed a bookcase? Undoubtedly he has a highly eligible place from which to view processions. But for the transaction of business?\"{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=138}}\n\nWhen the building was first constructed, it received mixed feedback. The most known criticism received was known as \"Burnham's Folly\". This criticism, focused on the structure of the building, was made on the grounds that the \"combination of triangular shape and height would cause the building to fall down.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/flatiron-building|title=Flatiron Building - Facts & Summary|last=|first=|date=2010|website=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|history.com]]|publisher=[[A&E Networks]]|access-date=July 29, 2017}}</ref> Critics believed that the building created a dangerous wind-tunnel at the intersection of the two streets, and could possibly knock the building down.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKoyDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA82|title=DK Eyewitness Travel Guide USA|last=DK|date=May 16, 2017|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781465466365|language=en}}</ref> Although the wind is strong at the intersection, the building's structure was meant to accommodate four times the typical wind loads in order to stabilize and retain the building's iconic triangular shape.\n\nThe ''[[New York Tribune]]'' called the new building \"A stingy piece of pie ... the greatest inanimate troublemaker in New York\", while the [[Municipal Art Society]] said that it was \"Unfit to be in the Center of the City\". ''The New York Times'' called it a \"monstrosity\".<ref name=\"treasure\" /> But some saw the building differently. Futurist [[H. G. Wells]] wrote in his 1906 book ''The Future in America: A Search After Realities'':\n\n<blockquote>I found myself agape, admiring a sky-scraper the prow of the Flat-iron Building, to be particular, ploughing up through the traffic of Broadway and Fifth Avenue in the afternoon light.<ref>[[H.

It was the subject of one of [[Edward Steichen]]'s atmospheric photographs, taken on a wet wintry late afternoon in 1904, as well as a memorable image by [[Alfred Stieglitz]] taken the year before, to which Steichen was paying homage. ''(See [[#iconic images|below]])''{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=153-57}} Stieglitz reflected on the dynamic symbolism of the building, noting upon seeing it one day during a snowstorm that \"... it appeared to be moving toward me like the bow of a monster ocean steamer \u2013 a picture of a new America still in the making,\"<ref name=treasure /><ref>[http://magicalhystorytour.blogspot.com/2010/08/skyscrapers.html \"Skyscrapers\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629192827/http://magicalhystorytour.blogspot.com/2010/08/skyscrapers.html |date=June 29, 2015 }} ''Magical Hystory Tour:The Origins of the Commonplace & Curious in America'' (September 1, 2010)</ref><ref>Burns, Ric & Sanders, James ''New York: An Illustrated History'', 233(1999)</ref> and remarked that what the [[Parthenon]] was to Athens, the Flatiron was to New York.<ref name=wsjrev /> When Stieglitz' photograph was published in ''Camera Work'', his friend [[Sadakichi Hartmann]], a writer, painter and photographer, accompanied it with an essay on the building: \"A curious creation, no doubt, but can it be called beautiful? Beauty is a very abstract idea ...

In 1910, Harry Black moved the company to [[Francis H. Kimball|Francis Kimball]]'s [[Trinity Building]] at 111 Broadway, where its parent company, U.S. Realty, had its offices. U.S. Realty moved its offices back to the Flatiron in 1916, and left permanently for the [[Fuller Building]] on 57th Street in 1929.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=214, 244, 252}}\n\nThe Flatiron's other original tenants included publishers (magazine publishing pioneer [[Frank Munsey]], ''American Architect and Building News'' and a vanity publisher), an insurance company (the [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company|Equitable Life Assurance Society]]), small businesses (a patent medicine company, Western Specialty Manufacturing Company and Whitehead & Hoag, who made celluloid novelties), music publishers (overflow from \"[[Tin Pan Alley]]\" up on [[28th Street (Manhattan)|28th Street]]), a landscape architect, the [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] Consulate, the Bohemian Guides Society, the Roebling Construction Company, owned by the sons of [[Tammany Hall]] boss [[Richard Croker]], and the crime syndicate, [[Murder, Inc.]]<ref name=treasure />\n\nThe retail space in the [[Flatiron Building#Cowcatcher space|building's \"cowcatcher\"]] at the \"prow\" was leased by [[United Cigar Stores]], and the building's vast cellar, which extended into the vaults that went more than {{convert|20|ft|m}} under the surrounding streets,{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=89}} was occupied by the Flatiron Restaurant, which could seat 1,500 patrons and was open from breakfast through late supper for those taking in a performance at one of the many [[Rialto, Manhattan|theatres which lined Broadway between 14th and 23rd Streets]].{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=133-41}}\n\nIn 1911, the building introduced a restaurant/club in the basement.

After U.S. Realty constructed the [[New York Hippodrome]], [[Madison Square Garden II|Madison Square Garden]] was no longer the venue of choice, and survived largely by staging [[boxing]] matches. The base of the Flatiron became a cruising spot for gay men, including some male [[prostitutes]].{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=233}} Nonetheless, in 1911 the Flatiron Restaurant was bought by Louis Bustanoby, of the well-known Caf\u00e9 des Beaux-Arts, and converted into a trendy 400-seat French restaurant, Taverne Louis. As an innovation to attract customers away from another restaurant opened by his brothers, Bustanoby hired a black musical group, [[Louis Mitchell]] and his Southern Symphony Quintette, to play dance tunes at the Taverne and the Caf\u00e9. [[Irving Berlin]] heard the group at the Taverne and suggested that they should try to get work in London, which they did.{{efn-ua|Mitchell would later become a headliner and nightclub owner [[Paris]], becoming a millionaire before losing it all.

Black, in need of cash for his [[U.S. Realty Company]], sold the Flatiron Building to a syndicate set up by [[Lewis Rosenbaum]], who also owned assorted other notable buildings around the U.S. The price was $2 million, which equaled Black's cost for buying the lot and erecting the Flatiron.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=244-45}} The syndicate defaulted on its mortgage in 1933, and was taken over by the lender, [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company|Equitable Life Assurance Company]] after failing to sell it at auction. To attract tenants, Equitable did some modernization of the building, including replacing the original cast-iron birdcage elevators, which had cabs covered in rubber tiling and were originally built by [[Hecla Iron Works]], but the hydraulic power system was not replaced. By the mid-1940s, the building was fully rented.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=264-64}}\n\nWhen the U.S. entered [[World War I]], the Federal government instituted a \"Wake Up America!\" campaign, and the United Cigar store in the Flatiron's cowcatcher donated its space to the [[U.S. Navy]] for use as a recruiting center.

Though Burnham maintained overall control of the design process, he was not directly connected with the details of the structure as built. That task was performed by his designer [[Frederick P. Dinkelberg]], a Pennsylvania-born architect in Burnham's office, who first worked for Burnham in putting together the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, for which Burnham was the chief of construction and master designer.<ref group=\"upper-alpha\">Other buildings by Dinkelberg at D.

They strengthened the structure to deal with the wind load, as the building was quite narrow and therefore had less volume to resist it. They designed it so that, in theory, the building would turn compactly before any failure could occur in the metal structure. For the first time the construction of a skyscraper steel structure could be witnessed in full by the public, an event that received a great response and was immortalized by photographers Edward Steichen and Alfred Stieglitz.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.wikiarquitectura.com/building/flatiron-building/|title=Flatiron Building |access-date=October 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Design features===\n{{Anchor|Cowcatcher space}}The \"cowcatcher\" retail space at the front of the building was not part of Burnham or Dinkelberg's design, but was added at the insistence of Harry Black in order to maximize the use of the building's lot and produce some retail income to help defray the cost of construction. Black pushed Burnham hard for plans for the addition, but Burnham resisted because of the aesthetic effect it would have on the design of the \"prow\" of the building, where it would interrupt the two-story high Classical columns which were echoed at the top of the building by two columns which supported the cornice. Black insisted, and Burnham was forced to accept the addition, despite the interruption of the design's symmetry.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=101-03}} \n\nThe building was considered to be \"quirky\" overall, with drafty wood-framed and cooper-clad windows, no central air conditioning, a heating system which utilized cast-iron radiators, an antiquated sprinkler system, and a single staircase should evacuation of the building be necessary.  The triangular shape of the structure led to a \"rabbit warren\" of oddly-shaped rooms.<ref name=era /> Other oddities about the building's interior include that bathrooms for males and females are placed on alternating floors, with the men's rooms on even floors and the women's rooms on odd ones. Additionally, to reach the top floor &ndash; the 21st, which was added in 1905, three years after the building was completed &ndash; a second elevator has to be taken from the 20th floor.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is intended to be [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the twenty-fourth film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).

Marvel and Johansson expressed interest in a solo film several times over the following years, before Schaeffer and Shortland were hired in 2018. Benson joined in early 2019, with Pearson added later. Filming took place from May to October, in [[Norway]], [[Budapest]], [[Morocco]], [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, and in [[Atlanta]] and [[Macon, Georgia]].\n\nOriginally scheduled for May 1, 2020, the film's release was delayed indefinitely due to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic.The Movie is now scheduled to hit theatres on August 21st 2020\n\n== Premise ==\nFollowing the events of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016),<ref name=\"BWTimeline\" /> [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] finds herself alone and forced to confront a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past.

''\u00c6on Flux'' didn't open well, and three days after it opened, the studio said, 'We don't think it's time to do this movie.'\"|source=\u2014David Hayter on his version of the script and why that project failed to move forward.<ref name=\"HayterNov2011\" />}}\nIn February 2004, [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] acquired the film rights for [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]],<ref name=\"LionsGateRights\" /> and in April announced [[David Hayter]] as writer and director of the film, with [[Marvel Studios]]' [[Avi Arad]] producing.<ref name=\"HayterDirectWrite\" /> By June 2006, Lionsgate had dropped the project and the rights reverted to Marvel Studios. Hayter and Marvel tried getting another financier to develop the project, but Hayter \"never felt comfortable that we had found a place that was willing to take the movie, and the character, seriously.\" This left Hayter \"heartbroken\", but he hoped the film would be made \"some day\".<ref name=\"LionsGateDrop\" />\n\nIn January 2009, Marvel entered early talks with [[Emily Blunt]] to play Black Widow in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'',<ref name=\"BluntWidow\" /> though she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]''.<ref name=\"BluntOut\" /> In March 2009, [[Scarlett Johansson]] signed on to play Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, with her deal including options for multiple films.<ref name=\"JohanssonMarch2009\" /> In September 2010, while promoting the home media release of ''Iron Man 2'', Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] stated that discussions with Johansson had already taken place regarding a Black Widow standalone film, but that Marvel's focus was on 2012's ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"IGNSep2010\" /> Johansson appeared in that film as the character,<ref name=\"Avengers\" /> as well as 2014's ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'',<ref name=\"WinterSoldier\" /> 2015's ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'',<ref name=\"AvengersAoU\" /> 2016's ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'',<ref name=\"CapCW\" /> 2018's ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'',<ref name=\"InfinityWar\" /> and 2019's ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.<ref name=\"Endgame\" /> After the release of ''Age of Ultron'', Johansson revealed that the number of films on her contract had been adjusted since she first signed to match the \"demand of the character\", as Marvel had not anticipated the audience's \"great reaction\" to the character and her performance.<ref name=\"JohanssonApril2015\" />\n\nIn February 2014, Feige stated that after exploring Black Widow's past in ''Age of Ultron'', he would like to see it explored further in a solo film, which already had development work done for it,<ref name=\"BlackWidowSolo\" /> including a \"pretty in depth\" treatment by [[Nicole Perlman]], who co-wrote Marvel's ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014).<ref name=\"PerlmanWidow\" /> The following April, Johansson expressed interest in starring in a Black Widow film, and said that it would be driven by demand from the audience.<ref name=\"JohanssonApr2014\" /> That July, Hayter expressed interest in reviving the project for Marvel,<ref name=\"HayterRevive\" /> and the following month, director [[Neil Marshall]] stated that he \"would {{em|love}} to do a Black Widow film,\" saying he felt the character was \"really interesting [given] she doesn't have any superpowers, she just has extraordinary skills, and the world that she comes from, being this ex-[[K.G.B.]] assassin, I find that really fascinating.\"<ref name=\"Marshall\" /> In April 2015, Johansson spoke more on the possibility of a solo Black Widow film, seeing the potential to explore the different \"layers\" of her depicted in the different films so far, but also stating that \"right now I think this character is used well in this part of the universe\".<ref name=\"JohanssonApril2015\" /> While promoting ''Captain America: Civil War'' the next April, Feige noted that due to the announced schedule of films, any potential ''Black Widow'' film would be four or five years away.<ref name=\"FeigeApril2016\" /> He added that Marvel was \"creatively and emotionally\" committed to making a ''Black Widow'' film eventually.<ref name=\"FeigeMay2016\" />\n\nIn July 2016, [[Joss Whedon]], the director of ''The Avengers'' and ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', stated that he was open to directing a ''Black Widow'' film, feeling he could make \"a spy thriller. Like really do a good, paranoid, '[[John le Carr\u00e9]] on crack' sort of thing.\"<ref name=\"WhedonJuly2016\" /> In October, Johansson discussed the potential film being a prequel, saying, \"you can bring it back to Russia. You could explore the Widow program. There's all kinds of stuff that you could do with it.\" She did caution she may not want to \"wear a skin-tight catsuit\" for much longer.<ref name=\"JohanssonOct2016\" /> The next February, Johansson said that she would dedicate herself to making any potential Black Widow film \"amazing. It would have to be the best version that movie could possibly be. Otherwise, I would never do it ... [it would] have to be its own standalone and its own style and its own story.\"<ref name=\"JohanssonFeb2017\" /> Due to the development work already done, and the public support for a Black Widow film, Marvel ultimately decided that the \"best time to move forward with the project\" would be at the beginning of the \"latest phase\" of the MCU in 2020.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" />\n\nIn October 2017, Feige met with Johansson to discuss the direction of a potential solo film, before Marvel began meeting with writers for the project, including [[Jac Schaeffer]].<ref name=\"KrollThanksgiving\" /> Schaeffer met with Feige again in December, and was hired to write a script for the film before the end of 2017.<ref name=\"SchaefferJan2018\" /><ref name=\"KrollSchaeffer\" /> Schaeffer and Johansson were set to discuss the direction of the film at the beginning of February 2018.<ref name=\"KrollUpdate\" /> Marvel began meeting with female directors to potentially take on the project, part of a priority push by major film studios to hire female directors for franchises.<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> By the end of April, the studio had met with over 65 directors for the project in an \"extremely thorough\" search,<ref name=\"May2018Directors\" /> including [[Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven]], [[Chlo\u00e9 Zhao]]\u2014who was eventually chosen to direct Marvel's ''[[The Eternals (film)|The Eternals]]''<ref name=\"Zhao\" />\u2014[[Amma Asante]],<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> and [[Lynn Shelton]].<ref name=\"SheltonConsidered\" /> In the following months, this was reduced to a shortlist of 49 directors before the top choices of [[Cate Shortland]], Asante, and [[Maggie Betts]] met with Feige and Johansson in June.<ref name=\"Jun2018Directors\" /> [[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]] and [[Kimberly Peirce]] were also in the \"next-to-final mix\".<ref name=\"Jul2018Directors\" /><ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" /> Shortland had the backing of Johansson, a fan of the director's previous female-starring film ''[[Lore (film)|Lore]]'' (2012), and was hired the next month.<ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" />\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported in October 2018 that Johansson would earn $15 million for the film, an increase from the \"low-seven figure salary\" that she earned for starring in ''The Avengers''. $15 million is what [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] and [[Chris Hemsworth]] each earned for the third films in their MCU franchises\u2014''Civil War'' and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017), respectively. The pair also earned that amount for co-starring in ''Infinity War'' and ''Endgame''. Despite ''The Hollywood Reporter'' confirming these amounts with \"multiple knowledgeable sources\" for their report, Marvel Studios disputed the accuracy of the numbers and said that they \"never publicly disclose salaries or deal terms.\"<ref name=\"JohannsonPayOct2018\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nIn February 2019, [[Ned Benson]] was hired to rewrite the script,<ref name=\"BensonRewriteFebruary2019\" /> and Feige confirmed the studio was not looking to have the film receive an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], which had been rumored previously.<ref name=\"RRatingFalse\" /> The following month, [[Florence Pugh]] entered negotiations to join the cast as a spy who is \"morally opposite\" to Romanoff.<ref name=\"PughTHR\" /> Marvel had been considering Pugh for the role since late 2018 but began looking at other actresses, including [[Saoirse Ronan]], in early 2019.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /><ref name=\"RonanVariety\" /> The studio returned to Pugh for the role after she received strong reviews for her performance in the film ''[[Fighting with My Family]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /> In April 2019, Pugh was confirmed to have been cast alongside [[David Harbour]],<ref name=\"Harbour\" /> [[Rachel Weisz]],<ref name=\"Weisz\" /><ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> and [[O-T Fagbenle]].<ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> Feige likened the film to the television series ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', which is a prequel to the series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', because it was \"a wonderful example of a prequel that almost completely stands on its own... [but] it informs you about so many things you didn't know about before.\"<ref name=\"Feigeio9June2019\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began on May 28, 2019, in [[Norway]].<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> By early June, production moved to [[Pinewood Studios]] in London,<ref name=\"PinewoodFilming\" /> while [[Ray Winstone]] joined the film later that month.<ref name=\"Winstone\" /> The film was officially announced at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] in July, with a release date of May 1, 2020, revealed alongside roles for some of the new cast members.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> In August, bodybuilder [[Olivier Richters]] announced that he had been cast in the film.<ref name=\"Richters\" /> The next month, ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported that [[Robert Downey Jr.]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]].<ref name=\"Downey\" /> A [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrap]] party for the film was held at the end of September,<ref name=\"FilmingStartDelayed\" /><ref name=\"Macon\" /> before production moved to [[Macon, Georgia]] for the week of September 30. Filming locations in Macon, including [[Terminal Station (Macon, Georgia)|Terminal Station]], were dressed to portray [[Albany, New York]].<ref name=\"Macon\" /> Set photos in October revealed [[William Hurt]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]].<ref name=\"Hurt\" /> Filming also took place in [[Atlanta]], [[Budapest]], and [[Morocco]].<ref name=\"PughNov2019\" /> Filming officially wrapped on October 6, 2019.<ref name=\"Wrap\" />\n\nRegarding the film's action sequences, Shortland said they had to have \"peril at its heart\" and be \"really emotional but also story-driven.\" ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'' (2010) was also a source of inspiration for Shortland.<ref name=\"EmpireMagazineMay2020\" />{{rp|63}}\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn January 2020, a special look trailer credited [[Eric Pearson]] as the screenwriter for the film, with Schaeffer and Benson receiving story credit.<ref name=\"WritingCredits\" /> Additionally, Jeff Sneider of ''[[Collider (website)|Collider]]'' pointed out that the trailer's credit block did not include a cinematographer for the film. He revealed that earlier reports suggesting that [[Rob Hardy (cinematographer)|Rob Hardy]] was hired as cinematographer had been correct, but Hardy had left the production before filming began and instead [[Gabriel Beristain]] had served as the cinematographer for the film. Sneider wondered if contractual obstacles were to blame for Marvel not crediting Beristain so far, but felt he would be credited in marketing materials leading up to the film's release.<ref name=\"Beristain\" /> In mid-March, Disney removed the film from its release schedule due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Delayed\" />\n\n== Music ==\n[[Alexandre Desplat]] was revealed to be composing the music for the film in January 2020.<ref name=\"Desplat\" /> By March 2020, [[Lorne Balfe]] was now scoring the film.<ref name=\"Balfe\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nWith the film's official announcement at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, it was promoted by Feige, Shortland, and cast members who introduced footage from the first 30 days of production.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> The first teaser trailer for the film, featuring some of the footage that was shown at Comic-Con, was released on December 3, 2019.<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /> Several commentators noted that the film was \"long awaited\" or \"highly anticipated\" by fans,<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /><ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> and highlighted the spy thriller tone of the trailer.<ref name=\"TeaserMTV\" /><ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> Rachel Leishman of [[The Mary Sue]] described finally seeing the trailer for a ''Black Widow'' film as \"surprisingly emotional\", and felt that setting the film between ''Civil War'' and ''Infinity War'' would allow the character to grow into her more mature form from the latter film, after earlier MCU films had depicted the character in a supporting role to the male Avengers.<ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> Scott Mendelson at ''[[Forbes]]'' compared the trailer's story and tone to the films ''[[Atomic Blonde]]'' (2017), ''[[Red Sparrow]]'' (2018), and ''[[Anna (2019 film)|Anna]]'' (2019), but felt that starring a familiar character would give ''Black Widow'' a commercial advantage over those films. Mendelson thought that this aspect could outweigh the teaser's focus on \"family melodrama\" over superheroics, which he compared to ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011).<ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Richard Newby highlighted what he found to be noticeable differences between Shortland's shot composition and cinematography in the trailer from the styles of [[Jon Favreau]], Joss Whedon, and the [[Russo brothers]], all directors who helped to define Black Widow in previous MCU films.<ref name=\"TeaserTHR\" />\n\nA final trailer was released on March 9, 2020. Nicole Carpenter of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' called it \"the most in-depth look at the film we\u2019ve seen yet\".<ref name=\"PolygonFinalTrailer\" /> Josh Weiss of ''[[SyFy Wire]]'' enjoyed the \"quieter, more personal moments\" of the trailer in addition to \"all the action we've come to expect from the MCU\".<ref name=\"SyFyWireFinalTrailer\" /> Mendelson described the trailer as \"a noticeable improvement over the teaser\", attributing this to the appearance of multiple Black Widow characters which he said \"keeps the stakes somewhat grounded and presumably ties into the film\u2019s notion of found families (the Avengers), forced families (the fellow brainwashed murderers) and actual family (co-stars Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Rachel Weisz)\".<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''Black Widow'' was originally scheduled for release in the United States on May 1, 2020,<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> but was delayed due the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> It is set to be released in [[IMAX]].<ref name=\"SpecialLookTeaser\" /> \n\nAfter the release date for the film ''[[No Time to Die]]'' was shifted in early March from April 2020 to November 2020 due to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, especially the fact that theaters in many Asian countries were closed due to the pandemic, commentators began speculating about the potential for other large films like ''Black Widow'' being postponed as well. ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported on rumors in the film distribution industry suggesting that ''Black Widow'' would take the November release date of Marvel's ''The Eternals'', with the latter being delayed until 2021, but Disney confirmed with its exhibition partners that it still intended to release ''Black Widow'' in May 2020 despite the pandemic.<ref name=\"CoronavirusNoDelay\" /> After a final trailer was released for the film a week later, Scott Mendelson at ''Forbes'' highlighted how the trailer's existence and use of the May 2020 release date confirmed that the film was not being delayed, which he said was \"the logical choice at this juncture\" feeling there was no evidence that the pandemic would affect the film's performance in the U.S. especially when the film was \"already in its ideal release date\".<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" /> A week after that, theaters across the U.S. had been closed due to the spreading pandemic with gatherings larger than 50 people being discouraged by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], and Disney removed the film from its May release.<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> Discussing this decision for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Adam B. Vary and Matt Donnelly questioned whether the MCU could be impacted more by this delay than other big properties due to the interconnected nature of the franchise, though a Marvel Studios source told the pair that changing the film's release date would not affect the rest of the MCU timeline. Vary and Donnelly speculated that this was due to the film's status as a prequel.<ref name=\"DelayedDiscussion\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"LionsGateRights\">{{cite

upcoming American [[superhero film]] based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|of the same name]]. Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is intended to be [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the twenty-fourth film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Cate Shortland]] and written by [[Eric Pearson]] from a story by [[Jac Schaeffer]] and [[Ned Benson]], and stars [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow]] alongside [[Florence Pugh]], [[David Harbour]], [[O-T Fagbenle]], [[William Hurt]], [[Ray Winstone]], and [[Rachel Weisz]]. Set after ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), the film sees Romanoff on the run and forced to confront her past.\n\nDevelopment of a Black Widow film began in April 2004 by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]], with [[David Hayter]] attached to write and direct. The project did not move forward and the film rights to the character reverted to Marvel Studios by June 2006. Johansson was cast in the role for several MCU films beginning with ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010). Marvel and Johansson expressed interest in a solo film several times over the following years, before Schaeffer and Shortland were hired in 2018. Benson joined in early 2019, with Pearson added later. Filming took place from May to October, in [[Norway]], [[Budapest]], [[Morocco]], [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, and in [[Atlanta]] and [[Macon, Georgia]].\n\nOriginally scheduled for May 1, 2020, the film's release was delayed indefinitely due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n== Premise ==\nFollowing the events of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016),<ref name=\"BWTimeline\" /> [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] finds herself alone and forced to confront a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past.

''\u00c6on Flux'' didn't open well, and three days after it opened, the studio said, 'We don't think it's time to do this movie.'\"|source=\u2014David Hayter on his version of the script and why that project failed to move forward.<ref name=\"HayterNov2011\" />}}\nIn February 2004, [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] acquired the film rights for [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]],<ref name=\"LionsGateRights\" /> and in April announced [[David Hayter]] as writer and director of the film, with [[Marvel Studios]]' [[Avi Arad]] producing.<ref name=\"HayterDirectWrite\" /> By June 2006, Lionsgate had dropped the project and the rights reverted to Marvel Studios. Hayter and Marvel tried getting another financier to develop the project, but Hayter \"never felt comfortable that we had found a place that was willing to take the movie, and the character, seriously.\" This left Hayter \"heartbroken\", but he hoped the film would be made \"some day\".<ref name=\"LionsGateDrop\" />\n\nIn January 2009, Marvel entered early talks with [[Emily Blunt]] to play Black Widow in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'',<ref name=\"BluntWidow\" /> though she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]''.<ref name=\"BluntOut\" /> In March 2009, [[Scarlett Johansson]] signed on to play Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, with her deal including options for multiple films.<ref name=\"JohanssonMarch2009\" /> In September 2010, while promoting the home media release of ''Iron Man 2'', Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] stated that discussions with Johansson had already taken place regarding a Black Widow standalone film, but that Marvel's focus was on 2012's ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"IGNSep2010\" /> Johansson appeared in that film as the character,<ref name=\"Avengers\" /> as well as 2014's ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'',<ref name=\"WinterSoldier\" /> 2015's ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'',<ref name=\"AvengersAoU\" /> 2016's ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'',<ref name=\"CapCW\" /> 2018's ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'',<ref name=\"InfinityWar\" /> and 2019's ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.<ref name=\"Endgame\" /> After the release of ''Age of Ultron'', Johansson revealed that the number of films on her contract had been adjusted since she first signed to match the \"demand of the character\", as Marvel had not anticipated the audience's \"great reaction\" to the character and her performance.<ref name=\"JohanssonApril2015\" />\n\nIn February 2014, Feige stated that after exploring Black Widow's past in ''Age of Ultron'', he would like to see it explored further in a solo film, which already had development work done for it,<ref name=\"BlackWidowSolo\" /> including a \"pretty in depth\" treatment by [[Nicole Perlman]], who co-wrote Marvel's ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014).<ref name=\"PerlmanWidow\" /> The following April, Johansson expressed interest in starring in a Black Widow film, and said that it would be driven by demand from the audience.<ref name=\"JohanssonApr2014\" /> That July, Hayter expressed interest in reviving the project for Marvel,<ref name=\"HayterRevive\" /> and the following month, director [[Neil Marshall]] stated that he \"would {{em|love}} to do a Black Widow film,\" saying he felt the character was \"really interesting [given] she doesn't have any superpowers, she just has extraordinary skills, and the world that she comes from, being this ex-[[K.G.B.]] assassin, I find that really fascinating.\"<ref name=\"Marshall\" /> In April 2015, Johansson spoke more on the possibility of a solo Black Widow film, seeing the potential to explore the different \"layers\" of her depicted in the different films so far, but also stating that \"right now I think this character is used well in this part of the universe\".<ref name=\"JohanssonApril2015\" /> While promoting ''Captain America: Civil War'' the next April, Feige noted that due to the announced schedule of films, any potential ''Black Widow'' film would be four or five years away.<ref name=\"FeigeApril2016\" /> He added that Marvel was \"creatively and emotionally\" committed to making a ''Black Widow'' film eventually.<ref name=\"FeigeMay2016\" />\n\nIn July 2016, [[Joss Whedon]], the director of ''The Avengers'' and ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', stated that he was open to directing a ''Black Widow'' film, feeling he could make \"a spy thriller. Like really do a good, paranoid, '[[John le Carr\u00e9]] on crack' sort of thing.\"<ref name=\"WhedonJuly2016\" /> In October, Johansson discussed the potential film being a prequel, saying, \"you can bring it back to Russia. You could explore the Widow program. There's all kinds of stuff that you could do with it.\" She did caution she may not want to \"wear a skin-tight catsuit\" for much longer.<ref name=\"JohanssonOct2016\" /> The next February, Johansson said that she would dedicate herself to making any potential Black Widow film \"amazing. It would have to be the best version that movie could possibly be. Otherwise, I would never do it ... [it would] have to be its own standalone and its own style and its own story.\"<ref name=\"JohanssonFeb2017\" /> Due to the development work already done, and the public support for a Black Widow film, Marvel ultimately decided that the \"best time to move forward with the project\" would be at the beginning of the \"latest phase\" of the MCU in 2020.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" />\n\nIn October 2017, Feige met with Johansson to discuss the direction of a potential solo film, before Marvel began meeting with writers for the project, including [[Jac Schaeffer]].<ref name=\"KrollThanksgiving\" /> Schaeffer met with Feige again in December, and was hired to write a script for the film before the end of 2017.<ref name=\"SchaefferJan2018\" /><ref name=\"KrollSchaeffer\" /> Schaeffer and Johansson were set to discuss the direction of the film at the beginning of February 2018.<ref name=\"KrollUpdate\" /> Marvel began meeting with female directors to potentially take on the project, part of a priority push by major film studios to hire female directors for franchises.<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> By the end of April, the studio had met with over 65 directors for the project in an \"extremely thorough\" search,<ref name=\"May2018Directors\" /> including [[Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven]], [[Chlo\u00e9 Zhao]]\u2014who was eventually chosen to direct Marvel's ''[[The Eternals (film)|The Eternals]]''<ref name=\"Zhao\" />\u2014[[Amma Asante]],<ref name=\"Apr2018Directors\" /> and [[Lynn Shelton]].<ref name=\"SheltonConsidered\" /> In the following months, this was reduced to a shortlist of 49 directors before the top choices of [[Cate Shortland]], Asante, and [[Maggie Betts]] met with Feige and Johansson in June.<ref name=\"Jun2018Directors\" /> [[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]] and [[Kimberly Peirce]] were also in the \"next-to-final mix\".<ref name=\"Jul2018Directors\" /><ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" /> Shortland had the backing of Johansson, a fan of the director's previous female-starring film ''[[Lore (film)|Lore]]'' (2012), and was hired the next month.<ref name=\"ShortlandDirect\" />\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported in October 2018 that Johansson would earn $15 million for the film, an increase from the \"low-seven figure salary\" that she earned for starring in ''The Avengers''. $15 million is what [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] and [[Chris Hemsworth]] each earned for the third films in their MCU franchises\u2014''Civil War'' and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017), respectively. The pair also earned that amount for co-starring in ''Infinity War'' and ''Endgame''. Despite ''The Hollywood Reporter'' confirming these amounts with \"multiple knowledgeable sources\" for their report, Marvel Studios disputed the accuracy of the numbers and said that they \"never publicly disclose salaries or deal terms.\"<ref name=\"JohannsonPayOct2018\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nIn February 2019, [[Ned Benson]] was hired to rewrite the script,<ref name=\"BensonRewriteFebruary2019\" /> and Feige confirmed the studio was not looking to have the film receive an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], which had been rumored previously.<ref name=\"RRatingFalse\" /> The following month, [[Florence Pugh]] entered negotiations to join the cast as a spy who is \"morally opposite\" to Romanoff.<ref name=\"PughTHR\" /> Marvel had been considering Pugh for the role since late 2018 but began looking at other actresses, including [[Saoirse Ronan]], in early 2019.<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /><ref name=\"RonanVariety\" /> The studio returned to Pugh for the role after she received strong reviews for her performance in the film ''[[Fighting with My Family]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"PughVariety\" /> In April 2019, Pugh was confirmed to have been cast alongside [[David Harbour]],<ref name=\"Harbour\" /> [[Rachel Weisz]],<ref name=\"Weisz\" /><ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> and [[O-T Fagbenle]].<ref name=\"Fagbenle\" /> Feige likened the film to the television series ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', which is a prequel to the series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', because it was \"a wonderful example of a prequel that almost completely stands on its own... [but] it informs you about so many things you didn't know about before.\"<ref name=\"Feigeio9June2019\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began on May 28, 2019, in [[Norway]].<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> By early June, production moved to [[Pinewood Studios]] in London,<ref name=\"PinewoodFilming\" /> while [[Ray Winstone]] joined the film later that month.<ref name=\"Winstone\" /> The film was officially announced at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] in July, with a release date of May 1, 2020, revealed alongside roles for some of the new cast members.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> In August, bodybuilder [[Olivier Richters]] announced that he had been cast in the film.<ref name=\"Richters\" /> The next month, ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported that [[Robert Downey Jr.]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]].<ref name=\"Downey\" /> A [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrap]] party for the film was held at the end of September,<ref name=\"FilmingStartDelayed\" /><ref name=\"Macon\" /> before production moved to [[Macon, Georgia]] for the week of September 30. Filming locations in Macon, including [[Terminal Station (Macon, Georgia)|Terminal Station]], were dressed to portray [[Albany, New York]].<ref name=\"Macon\" /> Set photos in October revealed [[William Hurt]] would appear in the film in his MCU role as [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]].<ref name=\"Hurt\" /> Filming also took place in [[Atlanta]], [[Budapest]], and [[Morocco]].<ref name=\"PughNov2019\" /> Filming officially wrapped on October 6, 2019.<ref name=\"Wrap\" />\n\nRegarding the film's action sequences, Shortland said they had to have \"peril at its heart\" and be \"really emotional but also story-driven.\" ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'' (2010) was also a source of inspiration for Shortland.<ref name=\"EmpireMagazineMay2020\" />{{rp|63}}\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn January 2020, a special look trailer credited [[Eric Pearson]] as the screenwriter for the film, with Schaeffer and Benson receiving story credit.<ref name=\"WritingCredits\" /> Additionally, Jeff Sneider of ''[[Collider (website)|Collider]]'' pointed out that the trailer's credit block did not include a cinematographer for the film. He revealed that earlier reports suggesting that [[Rob Hardy (cinematographer)|Rob Hardy]] was hired as cinematographer had been correct, but Hardy had left the production before filming began and instead [[Gabriel Beristain]] had served as the cinematographer for the film. Sneider wondered if contractual obstacles were to blame for Marvel not crediting Beristain so far, but felt he would be credited in marketing materials leading up to the film's release.<ref name=\"Beristain\" /> In mid-March, Disney removed the film from its release schedule due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Delayed\" />\n\n== Music ==\n[[Alexandre Desplat]] was revealed to be composing the music for the film in January 2020.<ref name=\"Desplat\" /> By March 2020, [[Lorne Balfe]] was now scoring the film.<ref name=\"Balfe\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nWith the film's official announcement at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, it was promoted by Feige, Shortland, and cast members who introduced footage from the first 30 days of production.<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> The first teaser trailer for the film, featuring some of the footage that was shown at Comic-Con, was released on December 3, 2019.<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /> Several commentators noted that the film was \"long awaited\" or \"highly anticipated\" by fans,<ref name=\"TeaserCNN\" /><ref name=\"TeaserVerge\" /><ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> and highlighted the spy thriller tone of the trailer.<ref name=\"TeaserMTV\" /><ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> Rachel Leishman of [[The Mary Sue]] described finally seeing the trailer for a ''Black Widow'' film as \"surprisingly emotional\", and felt that setting the film between ''Civil War'' and ''Infinity War'' would allow the character to grow into her more mature form from the latter film, after earlier MCU films had depicted the character in a supporting role to the male Avengers.<ref name=\"TeaserMS\" /> Scott Mendelson at ''[[Forbes]]'' compared the trailer's story and tone to the films ''[[Atomic Blonde]]'' (2017), ''[[Red Sparrow]]'' (2018), and ''[[Anna (2019 film)|Anna]]'' (2019), but felt that starring a familiar character would give ''Black Widow'' a commercial advantage over those films. Mendelson thought that this aspect could outweigh the teaser's focus on \"family melodrama\" over superheroics, which he compared to ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011).<ref name=\"TeaserForbes\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Richard Newby highlighted what he found to be noticeable differences between Shortland's shot composition and cinematography in the trailer from the styles of [[Jon Favreau]], Joss Whedon, and the [[Russo brothers]], all directors who helped to define Black Widow in previous MCU films.<ref name=\"TeaserTHR\" />\n\nA final trailer was released on March 9, 2020. Nicole Carpenter of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' called it \"the most in-depth look at the film we\u2019ve seen yet\".<ref name=\"PolygonFinalTrailer\" /> Josh Weiss of ''[[SyFy Wire]]'' enjoyed the \"quieter, more personal moments\" of the trailer in addition to \"all the action we've come to expect from the MCU\".<ref name=\"SyFyWireFinalTrailer\" /> Mendelson described the trailer as \"a noticeable improvement over the teaser\", attributing this to the appearance of multiple Black Widow characters which he said \"keeps the stakes somewhat grounded and presumably ties into the film\u2019s notion of found families (the Avengers), forced families (the fellow brainwashed murderers) and actual family (co-stars Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Rachel Weisz)\".<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''Black Widow'' was originally scheduled for release in the United States on May 1, 2020,<ref name=\"SDCCDetails\" /> but was delayed due the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> It is set to be released in [[IMAX]].<ref name=\"SpecialLookTeaser\" /> \n\nAfter the release date for the film ''[[No Time to Die]]'' was shifted in early March from April 2020 to November 2020 due to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, especially the fact that theaters in many Asian countries were closed due to the pandemic, commentators began speculating about the potential for other large films like ''Black Widow'' being postponed as well. ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported on rumors in the film distribution industry suggesting that ''Black Widow'' would take the November release date of Marvel's ''The Eternals'', with the latter being delayed until 2021, but Disney confirmed with its exhibition partners that it still intended to release ''Black Widow'' in May 2020 despite the pandemic.<ref name=\"CoronavirusNoDelay\" /> After a final trailer was released for the film a week later, Scott Mendelson at ''Forbes'' highlighted how the trailer's existence and use of the May 2020 release date confirmed that the film was not being delayed, which he said was \"the logical choice at this juncture\" feeling there was no evidence that the pandemic would affect the film's performance in the U.S. especially when the film was \"already in its ideal release date\".<ref name=\"ForbesFinalTrailer\" /> A week after that, theaters across the U.S. had been closed due to the spreading pandemic with gatherings larger than 50 people being discouraged by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], and Disney removed the film from its May release.<ref name=\"Delayed\" /> Discussing this decision for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Adam B. Vary and Matt Donnelly questioned whether the MCU could be impacted more by this delay than other big properties due to the interconnected nature of the franchise, though a Marvel Studios source told the pair that changing the film's release date would not affect the rest of the MCU timeline. Vary and Donnelly speculated that this was due to the film's status as a prequel.<ref name=\"DelayedDiscussion\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"LionsGateRights\">{{cite
