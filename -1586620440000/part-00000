IL-6 was serendipitously discovered as a myokine because of the observation that it increased in an exponential fashion proportional to the length of exercise and the amount of muscle mass engaged in the exercise. It has been consistently demonstrated that the plasma concentration of IL-6 increases during muscular exercise. This increase is followed by the appearance of IL-1ra and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. In general, the cytokine response to exercise and sepsis differs with regard to TNF-\u03b1. Thus, the cytokine response to exercise is not preceded by an increase in plasma-TNF-\u03b1. Following exercise, the basal plasma IL-6 concentration may increase up to 100-fold, but less dramatic increases are more frequent. The exercise-induced increase of plasma IL-6 occurs in an exponential manner and the peak IL-6 level is reached at the end of the exercise or shortly thereafter. It is the combination of mode, intensity, and duration of the exercise that determines the magnitude of the exercise-induced increase of plasma IL-6.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pedersen BK | title = Muscle as a secretory organ | journal = Comprehensive Physiology | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 1337\u201362 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23897689 | doi = 10.1002/cphy.c120033 | isbn = 9780470650714 }}</ref>\n\nIL-6 had previously been classified as a proinflammatory cytokine.

This finding clearly demonstrates that muscle damage is not required to provoke an increase in plasma IL-6 during exercise.

It appears that unlike IL-6 signalling in macrophages, which is dependent upon activation of the NF\u03baB signalling pathway, intramuscular IL-6 expression is regulated by a network of signalling cascades, including the Ca2+/NFAT and glycogen/p38 MAPK pathways. Thus, when IL-6 is signalling in monocytes or macrophages, it creates a pro-inflammatory response, whereas IL-6 activation and signalling in muscle is totally\nindependent of a preceding TNF-response or NF\u03baB activation, and is anti-inflammatory.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brandt C, Pedersen BK | title = The role of exercise-induced myokines in muscle homeostasis and the defense against chronic diseases | journal = Journal of Biomedicine & Biotechnology | volume = 2010 | issue =  | pages = 520258 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20224659 | doi = 10.1155/2010/520258 | pmc = 2836182 }}</ref>\n\nIL-6, among an increasing number of other recently identified myokines, thus remains an important topic in [[myokine]] research.

CD130 is the common signal transducer for several cytokines including [[leukemia inhibitory factor]] (LIF), [[ciliary neurotropic factor]], [[oncostatin M]], [[interleukin 11|IL-11]] and [[cardiotrophin-1]], and is almost ubiquitously expressed in most tissues. In contrast, the expression of CD126 is restricted to certain tissues. As IL-6 interacts with its receptor, it triggers the gp130 and IL-6R proteins to form a complex, thus activating the receptor. These complexes bring together the [[intracellular]] regions of gp130 to initiate a signal transduction cascade through certain [[transcription factors]], [[Janus kinase]]s (JAKs) and Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription ([[STAT protein|STATs]]).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Heinrich PC, Behrmann I, M\u00fcller-Newen G, Schaper F, Graeve L | title = Interleukin-6-type cytokine signalling through the gp130/Jak/STAT pathway | journal = The Biochemical Journal | volume = 334 ( Pt 2) | issue = Pt 2 | pages = 297\u2013314 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9716487 | pmc = 1219691 | doi = 10.1042/bj3340297 }}</ref>\n\nIL-6 is probably the best-studied of the cytokines that use [[gp130]], also known as IL-6 signal transducer (IL6ST),  in their signalling complexes.

Thus, when IL-6 is signalling in monocytes or macrophages, it creates a pro-inflammatory response, whereas IL-6 activation and signalling in muscle is totally\nindependent of a preceding TNF-response or NF\u03baB activation, and is anti-inflammatory.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brandt C, Pedersen BK | title = The role of exercise-induced myokines in muscle homeostasis and the defense against chronic diseases | journal = Journal of Biomedicine & Biotechnology | volume = 2010 | issue =  | pages = 520258 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20224659 | doi = 10.1155/2010/520258 | pmc = 2836182 }}</ref>\n\nIL-6, among an increasing number of other recently identified myokines, thus remains an important topic in [[myokine]] research.

CD130 is the common signal transducer for several cytokines including [[leukemia inhibitory factor]] (LIF), [[ciliary neurotropic factor]], [[oncostatin M]], [[interleukin 11|IL-11]] and [[cardiotrophin-1]], and is almost ubiquitously expressed in most tissues. In contrast, the expression of CD126 is restricted to certain tissues. As IL-6 interacts with its receptor, it triggers the gp130 and IL-6R proteins to form a complex, thus activating the receptor. These complexes bring together the [[intracellular]] regions of gp130 to initiate a signal transduction cascade through certain [[transcription factors]], [[Janus kinase]]s (JAKs) and Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription ([[STAT protein|STATs]]).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Heinrich PC, Behrmann I, M\u00fcller-Newen G, Schaper F, Graeve L | title = Interleukin-6-type cytokine signalling through the gp130/Jak/STAT pathway | journal = The Biochemical Journal | volume = 334 ( Pt 2) | issue = Pt 2 | pages = 297\u2013314 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9716487 | pmc = 1219691 | doi = 10.1042/bj3340297 }}</ref>\n\nIL-6 is probably the best-studied of the cytokines that use [[gp130]], also known as IL-6 signal transducer (IL6ST),  in their signalling complexes.

SP, a hybrid neurotransmitter-cytokine, is co-transmitted with BDNF through paleo-spinothalamic circuitry from the periphery with collaterals into key areas of the limbic system. However, both IL6 and SP mitigate expression of BDNF in brain regions associated with negative affect and memory. SP and IL6 both relax tight junctions of the blood brain barrier, such that effects seen in fMRI experiments with these molecules may be a bidirectional mix of neuronal, glial, capillary, synaptic, paracrine, or endocrine-like effects. At the cellular level, SP is noted to increase expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) through PI-3K, p42/44 and p38 MAP kinase pathways.

New Democracy and PASOK were created in the wake of the toppling of the military junta in 1974, and ruled Greece alternately for the previous four decades. Following the electoral decline of PASOK, New Democracy remained one of the two major parties in Greece, the other being the [[Coalition of the Radical Left]] (SYRIZA).\n\nHaving spent four and a half years in opposition to SYRIZA's government, New Democracy regained its majority in the [[Hellenic Parliament]] and returned to government under [[Kyriakos Mitsotakis]] after the [[2019 Greek legislative election|2019 legislative election]].\n\nThe traditional support of New Democracy comes from an electorate leaning to the right and conservatives. From a geographical perspective, its main support base is in the rural areas of Greece as well as the city centers of Athens and Thessaloniki. Its support is generally weak in areas like West Greece, Attica, Crete and the Aegean Islands. \n\nThe party was founded in 1974 by [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]] and in the same year it formed the first cabinet of the [[History of the Hellenic Republic#Third Hellenic Republic|Third Hellenic Republic]]. New Democracy is a member of the [[European People's Party]], the [[Centrist Democrat International]] and the [[International Democrat Union]].\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2012}}\n\n===Foundation===\n[[File:Karamanlis-konstantinos2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Konstantinos Karamanlis]], founder of New Democracy]]\nNew Democracy was founded on 4 October 1974 by [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]], in the beginning of the [[metapolitefsi]] era following the fall of the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374|Greek military junta]]. Karamanlis, who had already served as [[Prime Minister of Greece]] from 1955 to 1963, was sworn in as the first Prime Minister of the [[History of the Hellenic Republic#Third Hellenic Republic (1974-)|Third Hellenic Republic]] in a [[national unity government]] on 24 July 1974, until the first free elections of the new era. He intended New Democracy to be a more modern and progressive political party than the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] parties that ruled [[Greece]] before the [[1967 Greek coup d'\u00e9tat]], including his own [[National Radical Union]] (ERE). The party's ideology was defined as \"[[radicalism (historical)|radical liberalism]]\", a term defined as \"the prevalence of [[free market]] rules with the decisive intervention of the state in favour of [[social justice]].\" The party was formed out of dissident members the pre-Junta [[Centre Union]] and [[National Radical Union]], both of former Monarchists and Venizelists.\n\n===First government (1974\u20131981)===\nIn the [[1974 Greek legislative election|1974 legislative election]], New Democracy obtained a massive parliamentary majority of 220 seats with a record 54.37% of the vote, a result attributed to the personal appeal of Karamanlis to the electorate. Karamanlis was elected as Prime Minister and soon decided to hold a [[1974 Greek republic referendum|referendum]] on 8 December 1974 for the issue of the form of government; with a large majority of 69.17%, [[Monarchy of Greece|monarchy]] was eventually abolished in favour of a [[republic]]. The next major issue for the New Democracy cabinet was the creation of the [[Constitution of Greece]], which entered into force in 1975 and established Greece as a [[parliamentary republic]]. On 12 June 1975, Greece applied to join the [[European Communities]], of which it was already an associate member since 1961, while it had already been readmitted to the [[Council of Europe]] on 28 November 1974.\n\nIn the [[1977 Greek legislative election|1977 election]], New Democracy won again a large parliamentary majority of 171 seats, albeit with a reduced percentage of popular vote (41.84%). Under Karamanlis, Greece redefined its relations with [[NATO]] and tried to resolve the [[Cyprus dispute]] following the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish invasion]] of the island. In 1979, the first conference of the party was held in [[Chalkidiki]], where its ideological principles defined under the term \"radical liberalism\" were unanimously approved, as well as its statute and the operating regulations of its organizations.<ref name=nd_history>{{cite web|url=http://nd.gr/istoria|title=History|work=New Democracy official website|accessdate=23 January 2015|language=Greek}}</ref> It was the first conference of any [[List of political parties in Greece|Greek political party]] whose delegates were elected by the members.<ref name=nd_history/>\n\nKaramanlis' vision concerning the accession of Greece into the European Communities, despite the resolute opposition of the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) and the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_accession_of_greece-en-61a2a7a5-39a9-4b06-91f8-69ae77b41515.html|title=The accession of Greece|date=11 September 2012|work=[[Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l'Europe|CVCE]]|accessdate=23 January 2015|page=2}}</ref> led to the signing of the [[Treaty of Accession 1979|Treaty of Accession]] on 28 May 1979 in [[Athens]]; following the ratification of the act by the [[Hellenic Parliament]] on 28 June 1979, Greece became the tenth [[Member state of the European Union|member state of the European Communities]] on 1 January 1981. Karamanlis was criticised by opposing parties for not holding a referendum,<ref name=ethnologia>{{cite book|last=Lauth Bacas|first=Jutta|title=Ethnologia Balkanica|url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=0ogSzrXJEfMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=[[LIT Verlag]]|year=2004|page=8}}</ref> even though Greece's accession into the European Communities had been in the forefront of New Democracy's political platform, under which the party had been elected to power.<ref name=ethnologia/> Meanwhile, Karamanlis relinquished the premiership in 1980 and was elected as [[President of Greece]] by the parliament, serving until 1985. [[Georgios Rallis]] was elected as the new leader of New Democracy and succeeded Karamanlis in premiership.\n\n=== Opposition and Mitsotakis' rise to power (1981\u20131989) ===\nUnder the leadership of Georgios Rallis, New Democracy was defeated in the [[1981 Greek legislative election|1981 legislative elections]] by [[Andreas Papandreou]]'s PASOK which ran on a left-wing populist platform, and was placed in opposition for a first time with 35.87% share of the vote and 115 seats. On the same day, on 18 October 1981, New Democracy was also defeated in the [[1981 European Parliament election in Greece|first Greek election to the European Parliament]]. In the following December, the party's parliamentary group elected [[Evangelos Averoff]], former [[Minister for National Defence (Greece)|Minister for National Defence]], as president of New Democracy, but he resigned in 1984 due to health problems. On 1 September 1984, [[Konstantinos Mitsotakis]] succeeded him in the party's presidency and he managed to increase its percentage in the [[1985 Greek legislative election|1985 elections]] to 40.85%, although it was defeated again and remained in opposition.\n\n=== Second government (1989\u20131993) ===\n[[File:Mitsotakis and Demirel in 1992.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Konstantinos Mitsotakis]] and [[S\u00fcleyman Demirel]] (Prime Ministers of Greece and Turkey respectively) in the 1992 [[World Economic Forum]]]]\nMitsotakis led New Democracy to a clear win in the [[June 1989 Greek legislative election|June 1989 legislative elections]] registering 44.28% of the vote but, due to the modification of the electoral law by the outbound PASOK government, New Democracy obtained only 145 seats which were not enough to form a government on its own. The aftermath was the formation of a [[coalition government]] under [[Tzannis Tzannetakis]], consisted of New Democracy and [[Coalition of Left, of Movements and Ecology|Coalition of the Left and Progress]] (''Synaspismos''), with the latter also including at the time the Communist Party of Greece. In the subsequent [[November 1989 Greek legislative election|elections of November 1989]], New Democracy took one more comfortable win, increasing its share to 46.19% of the vote and 148 seats but, under the same electoral law, they were still short of forming a government and this led to a national unity government along with PASOK and Synaspismos, under [[Xenophon Zolotas]].\n\nEventually, in the [[1990 Greek legislative election|1990 election]] Mitsotakis' New Democracy defeated once again Papandreou's PASOK with a lead of 8.28%, but this time the 46.89% of votes awarded them with 150 seats, which allowed Mitsotakis to form a majority in the parliament with the support of [[Democratic Renewal]]'s (DIANA) sole [[member of parliament]] and one more seat given by the [[Supreme Special Court (Greece)|Supreme Special Court]], after a mistake in seat calculation was detected. After three consecutive wide wins with high vote percentages, Mitsotakis became the 178th Prime Minister of Greece, though with a slim parliamentary majority of 152 seats due to the electoral law in force at the time.\n\nIn a turbulent international political environment following the [[Revolutions of 1989|1989 Fall of Communism]] in Europe, Mitsotakis' government focused on cutting government spending, the privatization of state enterprises, the reformation of the public administration and the restoration of the original electoral system, with the addition of an [[election threshold]] of 3%. In foreign policy, the priorities were the restoration of confidence among Greece's economic and political partners, NATO and the [[United States]]. Mitsotakis also supported a new dialogue with [[Turkey]] on the [[Cyprus]] dispute and a compromise over the [[Macedonia naming dispute]]; the latter triggered an irritation among the MPs of New Democracy, which led [[Antonis Samaras]] to leave it and form a new political party in June 1993, [[Political Spring]]; one more withdrawal later from its parliamentary group resulted in New Democracy's loss of the majority in the parliament and the call of early elections.\n\n=== Opposition (1993\u20132004) ===\nIn the [[1993 Greek legislative election|1993 elections]], New Democracy suffered an easy defeat with 39.30% of the vote, something that led to Mitsotakis' resignation and the election of [[Miltiadis Evert]] in the party's leadership. In the early [[1996 Greek legislative election|1996 legislative election]], New Democracy was defeated again by [[Costas Simitis]]' PASOK registering 38.12%, but Evert obtained a re-election as the party's leader in the same year. However, in the spring of 1997 a new conference took place, in order to elect a new president among others. [[Kostas Karamanlis]], nephew of the party's founder, was elected the sixth president of New Democracy.\n\nUnder Karamanlis, New Democracy experienced an evident increase in popularity, but in the [[2000 Greek legislative election|2000 elections]] they lost by only 1.06% of the popular vote, the smallest margin in modern Greek history, registering 42.74% and obtaining 125 seats in the parliament. By 2003, New Democracy was consistently leading Simitis' PASOK in opinion polls; in January 2004 Simitis resigned and announced elections for 7 March, while [[George Papandreou]] succeeded him in PASOK's leadership.\n\n=== Third government (2004\u20132009) ===\nDespite speculation that Papandreou would succeed in restoring the party's fortunes, in the [[2004 Greek legislative election|2004 election]] Karamanlis managed to take a clear win with 45.36% of the vote and 165 seats, and New Democracy returned to power after eleven years in opposition, scoring an all-time record of 3,359,682 votes in the history of [[Elections in Greece|Greek elections]]. The regions that consistently support New Democracy include the [[Peloponnese]], [[Central Macedonia]] and [[West Macedonia]]. On the other hand, the party is weak in [[Crete]], the [[Aegean Islands]], [[Attica]] and [[West Greece]].\n\n[[File:Flickr - europeanpeoplesparty - Karamanlis5.jpg|thumb|[[Kostas Karamanlis]] giving an interview at a 2008 EPP summit]]\nOn 16 September 2007, [[Kostas Karamanlis]] won re-election with a diminished majority in [[Parliament of Greece|Parliament]], and stated: \"Thank you for your trust.

New Democracy and PASOK were created in the wake of the toppling of the military junta in 1974, and ruled Greece alternately for the previous four decades. Following the electoral decline of PASOK, New Democracy remained one of the two major parties in Greece, the other being the [[Coalition of the Radical Left]] (SYRIZA).\n\nHaving spent four and a half years in opposition to SYRIZA's government, New Democracy regained its majority in the [[Hellenic Parliament]] and returned to government under [[Kyriakos Mitsotakis]] after the [[2019 Greek legislative election|2019 legislative election]].\n\nThe traditional support of New Democracy comes from an electorate leaning to the right and conservatives. From a geographical perspective, its main support base is in the rural areas of Greece as well as the city centers of Athens and Thessaloniki. Its support is generally weak in areas like West Greece, Attica, Crete and the Aegean Islands. \n\nThe party was founded in 1974 by [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]] and in the same year it formed the first cabinet of the [[History of the Hellenic Republic#Third Hellenic Republic|Third Hellenic Republic]]. New Democracy is a member of the [[European People's Party]], the [[Centrist Democrat International]] and the [[International Democrat Union]].\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2012}}\n\n===Foundation===\n[[File:Karamanlis-konstantinos2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Konstantinos Karamanlis]], founder of New Democracy]]\nNew Democracy was founded on 4 October 1974 by [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]], in the beginning of the [[metapolitefsi]] era following the fall of the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374|Greek military junta]]. Karamanlis, who had already served as [[Prime Minister of Greece]] from 1955 to 1963, was sworn in as the first Prime Minister of the [[History of the Hellenic Republic#Third Hellenic Republic (1974-)|Third Hellenic Republic]] in a [[national unity government]] on 24 July 1974, until the first free elections of the new era. He intended New Democracy to be a more modern and progressive political party than the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] parties that ruled [[Greece]] before the [[1967 Greek coup d'\u00e9tat]], including his own [[National Radical Union]] (ERE). The party's ideology was defined as \"[[radicalism (historical)|radical liberalism]]\", a term defined as \"the prevalence of [[free market]] rules with the decisive intervention of the state in favour of [[social justice]].\" The party was formed out of dissident members the pre-Junta [[Centre Union]] and [[National Radical Union]], both of former Monarchists and Venizelists.\n\n===First government (1974\u20131981)===\nIn the [[1974 Greek legislative election|1974 legislative election]], New Democracy obtained a massive parliamentary majority of 220 seats with a record 54.37% of the vote, a result attributed to the personal appeal of Karamanlis to the electorate. Karamanlis was elected as Prime Minister and soon decided to hold a [[1974 Greek republic referendum|referendum]] on 8 December 1974 for the issue of the form of government; with a large majority of 69.17%, [[Monarchy of Greece|monarchy]] was eventually abolished in favour of a [[republic]]. The next major issue for the New Democracy cabinet was the creation of the [[Constitution of Greece]], which entered into force in 1975 and established Greece as a [[parliamentary republic]]. On 12 June 1975, Greece applied to join the [[European Communities]], of which it was already an associate member since 1961, while it had already been readmitted to the [[Council of Europe]] on 28 November 1974.\n\nIn the [[1977 Greek legislative election|1977 election]], New Democracy won again a large parliamentary majority of 171 seats, albeit with a reduced percentage of popular vote (41.84%). Under Karamanlis, Greece redefined its relations with [[NATO]] and tried to resolve the [[Cyprus dispute]] following the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish invasion]] of the island. In 1979, the first conference of the party was held in [[Chalkidiki]], where its ideological principles defined under the term \"radical liberalism\" were unanimously approved, as well as its statute and the operating regulations of its organizations.<ref name=nd_history>{{cite web|url=http://nd.gr/istoria|title=History|work=New Democracy official website|accessdate=23 January 2015|language=Greek}}</ref> It was the first conference of any [[List of political parties in Greece|Greek political party]] whose delegates were elected by the members.<ref name=nd_history/>\n\nKaramanlis' vision concerning the accession of Greece into the European Communities, despite the resolute opposition of the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) and the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_accession_of_greece-en-61a2a7a5-39a9-4b06-91f8-69ae77b41515.html|title=The accession of Greece|date=11 September 2012|work=[[Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l'Europe|CVCE]]|accessdate=23 January 2015|page=2}}</ref> led to the signing of the [[Treaty of Accession 1979|Treaty of Accession]] on 28 May 1979 in [[Athens]]; following the ratification of the act by the [[Hellenic Parliament]] on 28 June 1979, Greece became the tenth [[Member state of the European Union|member state of the European Communities]] on 1 January 1981. Karamanlis was criticised by opposing parties for not holding a referendum,<ref name=ethnologia>{{cite book|last=Lauth Bacas|first=Jutta|title=Ethnologia Balkanica|url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=0ogSzrXJEfMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=[[LIT Verlag]]|year=2004|page=8}}</ref> even though Greece's accession into the European Communities had been in the forefront of New Democracy's political platform, under which the party had been elected to power.<ref name=ethnologia/> Meanwhile, Karamanlis relinquished the premiership in 1980 and was elected as [[President of Greece]] by the parliament, serving until 1985. [[Georgios Rallis]] was elected as the new leader of New Democracy and succeeded Karamanlis in premiership.\n\n=== Opposition and Mitsotakis' rise to power (1981\u20131989) ===\nUnder the leadership of Georgios Rallis, New Democracy was defeated in the [[1981 Greek legislative election|1981 legislative elections]] by [[Andreas Papandreou]]'s PASOK which ran on a left-wing populist platform, and was placed in opposition for a first time with 35.87% share of the vote and 115 seats. On the same day, on 18 October 1981, New Democracy was also defeated in the [[1981 European Parliament election in Greece|first Greek election to the European Parliament]]. In the following December, the party's parliamentary group elected [[Evangelos Averoff]], former [[Minister for National Defence (Greece)|Minister for National Defence]], as president of New Democracy, but he resigned in 1984 due to health problems. On 1 September 1984, [[Konstantinos Mitsotakis]] succeeded him in the party's presidency and he managed to increase its percentage in the [[1985 Greek legislative election|1985 elections]] to 40.85%, although it was defeated again and remained in opposition.\n\n=== Second government (1989\u20131993) ===\n[[File:Mitsotakis and Demirel in 1992.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Konstantinos Mitsotakis]] and [[S\u00fcleyman Demirel]] (Prime Ministers of Greece and Turkey respectively) in the 1992 [[World Economic Forum]]]]\nMitsotakis led New Democracy to a clear win in the [[June 1989 Greek legislative election|June 1989 legislative elections]] registering 44.28% of the vote but, due to the modification of the electoral law by the outbound PASOK government, New Democracy obtained only 145 seats which were not enough to form a government on its own. The aftermath was the formation of a [[coalition government]] under [[Tzannis Tzannetakis]], consisted of New Democracy and [[Coalition of Left, of Movements and Ecology|Coalition of the Left and Progress]] (''Synaspismos''), with the latter also including at the time the Communist Party of Greece. In the subsequent [[November 1989 Greek legislative election|elections of November 1989]], New Democracy took one more comfortable win, increasing its share to 46.19% of the vote and 148 seats but, under the same electoral law, they were still short of forming a government and this led to a national unity government along with PASOK and Synaspismos, under [[Xenophon Zolotas]].\n\nEventually, in the [[1990 Greek legislative election|1990 election]] Mitsotakis' New Democracy defeated once again Papandreou's PASOK with a lead of 8.28%, but this time the 46.89% of votes awarded them with 150 seats, which allowed Mitsotakis to form a majority in the parliament with the support of [[Democratic Renewal]]'s (DIANA) sole [[member of parliament]] and one more seat given by the [[Supreme Special Court (Greece)|Supreme Special Court]], after a mistake in seat calculation was detected. After three consecutive wide wins with high vote percentages, Mitsotakis became the 178th Prime Minister of Greece, though with a slim parliamentary majority of 152 seats due to the electoral law in force at the time.\n\nIn a turbulent international political environment following the [[Revolutions of 1989|1989 Fall of Communism]] in Europe, Mitsotakis' government focused on cutting government spending, the privatization of state enterprises, the reformation of the public administration and the restoration of the original electoral system, with the addition of an [[election threshold]] of 3%. In foreign policy, the priorities were the restoration of confidence among Greece's economic and political partners, NATO and the [[United States]]. Mitsotakis also supported a new dialogue with [[Turkey]] on the [[Cyprus]] dispute and a compromise over the [[Macedonia naming dispute]]; the latter triggered an irritation among the MPs of New Democracy, which led [[Antonis Samaras]] to leave it and form a new political party in June 1993, [[Political Spring]]; one more withdrawal later from its parliamentary group resulted in New Democracy's loss of the majority in the parliament and the call of early elections.\n\n=== Opposition (1993\u20132004) ===\nIn the [[1993 Greek legislative election|1993 elections]], New Democracy suffered an easy defeat with 39.30% of the vote, something that led to Mitsotakis' resignation and the election of [[Miltiadis Evert]] in the party's leadership. In the early [[1996 Greek legislative election|1996 legislative election]], New Democracy was defeated again by [[Costas Simitis]]' PASOK registering 38.12%, but Evert obtained a re-election as the party's leader in the same year. However, in the spring of 1997 a new conference took place, in order to elect a new president among others. [[Kostas Karamanlis]], nephew of the party's founder, was elected the sixth president of New Democracy.\n\nUnder Karamanlis, New Democracy experienced an evident increase in popularity, but in the [[2000 Greek legislative election|2000 elections]] they lost by only 1.06% of the popular vote, the smallest margin in modern Greek history, registering 42.74% and obtaining 125 seats in the parliament. By 2003, New Democracy was consistently leading Simitis' PASOK in opinion polls; in January 2004 Simitis resigned and announced elections for 7 March, while [[George Papandreou]] succeeded him in PASOK's leadership.\n\n=== Third government (2004\u20132009) ===\nDespite speculation that Papandreou would succeed in restoring the party's fortunes, in the [[2004 Greek legislative election|2004 election]] Karamanlis managed to take a clear win with 45.36% of the vote and 165 seats, and New Democracy returned to power after eleven years in opposition, scoring an all-time record of 3,359,682 votes in the history of [[Elections in Greece|Greek elections]]. The regions that consistently support New Democracy include the [[Peloponnese]], [[Central Macedonia]] and [[West Macedonia]]. On the other hand, the party is weak in [[Crete]], the [[Aegean Islands]], [[Attica]] and [[West Greece]].\n\n[[File:Flickr - europeanpeoplesparty - Karamanlis5.jpg|thumb|[[Kostas Karamanlis]] giving an interview at a 2008 EPP summit]]\nOn 16 September 2007, [[Kostas Karamanlis]] won re-election with a diminished majority in [[Parliament of Greece|Parliament]], and stated: \"Thank you for your trust.
