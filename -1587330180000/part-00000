Aside from being a professional fighter, Alves has been a striking coach at the American Top Team since 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mmajunkie.com/2019/02/with-retirement-plans-set-thiago-alves-has-ideas-for-final-years-of-war|title=With retirement plans set, Thiago Alves has ideas for final 'years of war'|author=Mike Bohn|date=February 3, 2019|publisher=mmajunkie.com}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nBorn and raised in [[Fortaleza, Brazil]], Alves began training in [[Muay Thai]] at the age of 15 in order to get in better shape before transitioning to [[mixed martial arts]] at the age of 17. Alves won his first [[MMA]] bout as an amateur at just 15 years old, defeating a 25-year-old competitor by unanimous decision. At 19, Alves relocated from Brazil to [[Coconut Creek, Florida]] to train full-time at the prestigious [[American Top Team]] camp.\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\n\n===Ultimate Fighting Championship===\nAlves, with a record of 8\u20133, received an invitation to make his UFC debut at [[Ultimate Fight Night 2]] against fellow UFC newcomer [[Spencer Fisher]]. The fight would take place on Alves' twenty-second birthday. Despite having early success in the bout, especially on the ground, Alves fell victim to a triangle choke late in the second round.\n\nThiago returned to action on the undercard of [[UFC 56]], defeating previously-undefeated Ansar Chalangov by TKO due to punches at 2:25 into the first round.\n\nAt [[UFC 59]], Thiago was matched up against Derrick Noble, a fighter he had previously lost to by (rear-naked choke). The two fighters were both aggressive on the feet, in which Alves was forced to cover up after getting rocked with a flurry by Noble. Looking to capitalize, Noble rushed in when Alves caught him with a perfectly timed counterpunch that dropped him and led to Alves scoring a TKO victory.\n\nAt [[Ultimate Fight Night 5]], Alves was matched up against fellow up-and-comer [[Jon Fitch]]. In a match-up of two future top welterweight contenders, Fitch defeated Alves via TKO at 4:37 into the second round after landing a flush upkick to the face of Alves which dropped him and led to Fitch finishing the fight with strikes.\n\nAlves returned to his winning ways at [[Ortiz vs. Shamrock 3 - The Final Chapter]], defeating veteran [[John Alessio]] by unanimous decision.\n\n\"Pitbull\" completed a busy 2006, during which he fought four times. At [[UFC 66]], he dominated [[Tony DeSouza]], knocking out the jiu-jitsu black belt with a knee in the second round. Following his victory, it was announced that Alves tested positive for a [[diuretic]], [[spironolactone]], which he supposedly used to help him lose water weight in order to make the 170-pound limit.<ref>{{cite news\n|url= http://www.sherdog.com/news/news.asp?n_id=6483|title= NSAC Says Alves Tests Positive for Diuretic|work=Sherdog.com|date= January 4, 2007|accessdate=January 29, 2007 }}</ref> As a result of the failed drug test, Alves was suspended eight months by the Nevada State Athletic Commission and fined $5,500.<ref>{{cite web |last=Stupp |first=Dann |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/1949/thiago-alves-suspended-eight-months-fined-5500-by-nsac.mma |title=Thiago Alves Suspended Eight Months, Fined $5,500 by NSAC |work=MMAjunkie.com |date=February 16, 2007 |accessdate=February 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAlves returned at [[UFC Fight Night 11]], where he knocked out Japanese fighter [[Kuniyoshi Hironaka]] with a punch and knee in the second round. Less than two months later, Alves faced off against veteran contender [[Chris Lytle]] at [[UFC 78]]. After an exciting stand-up battle, doctors halted the bout at the end of the second round because of a cut above the eye of Lytle\u2014declaring Alves the winner by doctor stoppage.\n\nIn his first bout of 2008 at [[UFC Fight Night 13]], Alves faced his biggest test to date, as he was matched up against welterweight contender [[Karo Parisyan]]. After resisting any attempts to grapple but failing to amount any significant offense during the stand-up exchanges throughout the first round, \"The Pitbull\" scored a knee to the head of Parisyan, knocking down the [[judo]] expert before finishing him on the ground with strikes.\n\n===Rising up the welterweight ranks===\nOnce again taking just two months between bouts, Alves accepted a fight against former [[UFC Welterweight Championship|UFC Welterweight Champion]] [[Matt Hughes (fighter)|Matt Hughes]], a fighter widely considered the most dominant champion in UFC history. The Welterweight bout, which served as the main event of [[UFC 85]] in London, was scheduled as a late replacement after [[Chuck Liddell]] had to pull out of his headliner fight against [[Rashad Evans]] with a hamstring injury.\n\nPrior to the bout, Alves surprised many by missing weight for the welterweight bout\u2014coming in at 174 pounds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mmamania.com/2008/06/06/ufc-85-weigh-in-results-for-bedlam-ppv-event-in-london-thiago-alves-misses-weight/ |title=UFC 85 weigh-in results for 'Bedlam' PPV event in London; Thiago Alves misses weight |work=Mmamania.com |date=June 6, 2008 |accessdate=February 15, 2009}}</ref> Despite his opponent missing the 170-pound limit, Hughes accepted the fight at a catchweight. Despite the pre-fight blunder, Alves shocked the crowd by dominating the heavily favored former champion. After picking apart Hughes standing and displaying vastly-improved takedown defense throughout the first round, \"The Pitbull\" knocked Hughes down with a [[flying knee]] and followed him to the ground with punches early in the second, earning a TKO stoppage. In the post fight interview, Alves attributed not making weight to spraining his ankle two weeks before the fight.\n\nNext, Alves was slated to face [[Diego Sanchez]] at [[UFC 90]], in what many believed would be a match for the number-one contender spot. Sanchez, however, would be forced to pull out of the bout just weeks before the event due to injury.<ref>{{cite web |first=Gary |last=Herman |url=http://fiveouncesofpain.com/2008/10/13/sanchez-out-of-ufc-90-match-up-with-thiago-alves/ |title=Diego Sanchez out of UFC 90 match-up with Thiago Alves; to be replaced by Josh Koscheck |work=FiveOuncesofPain.com |date=October 13, 2008 |accessdate=February 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Josh Koscheck]], another top-contender and four-time [[NCAA]] wrestling [[All-American]], stepped in for Sanchez on short notice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mmaweekly.com/koscheck-steps-in-to-face-alves-at-ufc-90-2 |title=Koscheck Steps in to Face Alves at UFC 90 |work=MMAWeekly.com |date=October 13, 2008 |first=Ken |last=Pishna |accessdate=February 15, 2009}}</ref> Alves controlled most of the fight and won via unanimous decision (30\u201327, 29\u201328, and 30\u201327).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mmaweekly.com/ufc-90-results-and-live-play-by-play-2 |title=UFC 90 Results and Live Play-by-Play |work=MMAWeekly.com |date=October 23, 2008}}</ref> The Brazilian's improved takedown-defense was once again on display, as the American Top Team fighter forced Koscheck into a kick boxing battle.

(MMA)|welterweight]] in the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]]. Aside from being a professional fighter, Alves has been a striking coach at the American Top Team since 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mmajunkie.com/2019/02/with-retirement-plans-set-thiago-alves-has-ideas-for-final-years-of-war|title=With retirement plans set, Thiago Alves has ideas for final 'years of war'|author=Mike Bohn|date=February 3, 2019|publisher=mmajunkie.com}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nBorn and raised in [[Fortaleza, Brazil]], Alves began training in [[Muay Thai]] at the age of 15 in order to get in better shape before transitioning to [[mixed martial arts]] at the age of 17. Alves won his first [[MMA]] bout as an amateur at just 15 years old, defeating a 25-year-old competitor by unanimous decision. At 19, Alves relocated from Brazil to [[Coconut Creek, Florida]] to train full-time at the prestigious [[American Top Team]] camp.\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\n\n===Ultimate Fighting Championship===\nAlves, with a record of 8\u20133, received an invitation to make his UFC debut at [[Ultimate Fight Night 2]] against fellow UFC newcomer [[Spencer Fisher]]. The fight would take place on Alves' twenty-second birthday. Despite having early success in the bout, especially on the ground, Alves fell victim to a triangle choke late in the second round.\n\nThiago returned to action on the undercard of [[UFC 56]], defeating previously-undefeated Ansar Chalangov by TKO due to punches at 2:25 into the first round.\n\nAt [[UFC 59]], Thiago was matched up against Derrick Noble, a fighter he had previously lost to by (rear-naked choke). The two fighters were both aggressive on the feet, in which Alves was forced to cover up after getting rocked with a flurry by Noble. Looking to capitalize, Noble rushed in when Alves caught him with a perfectly timed counterpunch that dropped him and led to Alves scoring a TKO victory.\n\nAt [[Ultimate Fight Night 5]], Alves was matched up against fellow up-and-comer [[Jon Fitch]]. In a match-up of two future top welterweight contenders, Fitch defeated Alves via TKO at 4:37 into the second round after landing a flush upkick to the face of Alves which dropped him and led to Fitch finishing the fight with strikes.\n\nAlves returned to his winning ways at [[Ortiz vs. Shamrock 3 - The Final Chapter]], defeating veteran [[John Alessio]] by unanimous decision.\n\n\"Pitbull\" completed a busy 2006, during which he fought four times. At [[UFC 66]], he dominated [[Tony DeSouza]], knocking out the jiu-jitsu black belt with a knee in the second round. Following his victory, it was announced that Alves tested positive for a [[diuretic]], [[spironolactone]], which he supposedly used to help him lose water weight in order to make the 170-pound limit.<ref>{{cite news\n|url= http://www.sherdog.com/news/news.asp?n_id=6483|title= NSAC Says Alves Tests Positive for Diuretic|work=Sherdog.com|date= January 4, 2007|accessdate=January 29, 2007 }}</ref> As a result of the failed drug test, Alves was suspended eight months by the Nevada State Athletic Commission and fined $5,500.<ref>{{cite web |last=Stupp |first=Dann |url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/1949/thiago-alves-suspended-eight-months-fined-5500-by-nsac.mma |title=Thiago Alves Suspended Eight Months, Fined $5,500 by NSAC |work=MMAjunkie.com |date=February 16, 2007 |accessdate=February 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAlves returned at [[UFC Fight Night 11]], where he knocked out Japanese fighter [[Kuniyoshi Hironaka]] with a punch and knee in the second round. Less than two months later, Alves faced off against veteran contender [[Chris Lytle]] at [[UFC 78]]. After an exciting stand-up battle, doctors halted the bout at the end of the second round because of a cut above the eye of Lytle\u2014declaring Alves the winner by doctor stoppage.\n\nIn his first bout of 2008 at [[UFC Fight Night 13]], Alves faced his biggest test to date, as he was matched up against welterweight contender [[Karo Parisyan]]. After resisting any attempts to grapple but failing to amount any significant offense during the stand-up exchanges throughout the first round, \"The Pitbull\" scored a knee to the head of Parisyan, knocking down the [[judo]] expert before finishing him on the ground with strikes.\n\n===Rising up the welterweight ranks===\nOnce again taking just two months between bouts, Alves accepted a fight against former [[UFC Welterweight Championship|UFC Welterweight Champion]] [[Matt Hughes (fighter)|Matt Hughes]], a fighter widely considered the most dominant champion in UFC history. The Welterweight bout, which served as the main event of [[UFC 85]] in London, was scheduled as a late replacement after [[Chuck Liddell]] had to pull out of his headliner fight against [[Rashad Evans]] with a hamstring injury.\n\nPrior to the bout, Alves surprised many by missing weight for the welterweight bout\u2014coming in at 174 pounds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mmamania.com/2008/06/06/ufc-85-weigh-in-results-for-bedlam-ppv-event-in-london-thiago-alves-misses-weight/ |title=UFC 85 weigh-in results for 'Bedlam' PPV event in London; Thiago Alves misses weight |work=Mmamania.com |date=June 6, 2008 |accessdate=February 15, 2009}}</ref> Despite his opponent missing the 170-pound limit, Hughes accepted the fight at a catchweight. Despite the pre-fight blunder, Alves shocked the crowd by dominating the heavily favored former champion. After picking apart Hughes standing and displaying vastly-improved takedown defense throughout the first round, \"The Pitbull\" knocked Hughes down with a [[flying knee]] and followed him to the ground with punches early in the second, earning a TKO stoppage. In the post fight interview, Alves attributed not making weight to spraining his ankle two weeks before the fight.\n\nNext, Alves was slated to face [[Diego Sanchez]] at [[UFC 90]], in what many believed would be a match for the number-one contender spot. Sanchez, however, would be forced to pull out of the bout just weeks before the event due to injury.<ref>{{cite web |first=Gary |last=Herman |url=http://fiveouncesofpain.com/2008/10/13/sanchez-out-of-ufc-90-match-up-with-thiago-alves/ |title=Diego Sanchez out of UFC 90 match-up with Thiago Alves; to be replaced by Josh Koscheck |work=FiveOuncesofPain.com |date=October 13, 2008 |accessdate=February 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Josh Koscheck]], another top-contender and four-time [[NCAA]] wrestling [[All-American]], stepped in for Sanchez on short notice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mmaweekly.com/koscheck-steps-in-to-face-alves-at-ufc-90-2 |title=Koscheck Steps in to Face Alves at UFC 90 |work=MMAWeekly.com |date=October 13, 2008 |first=Ken |last=Pishna |accessdate=February 15, 2009}}</ref> Alves controlled most of the fight and won via unanimous decision (30\u201327, 29\u201328, and 30\u201327).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mmaweekly.com/ufc-90-results-and-live-play-by-play-2 |title=UFC 90 Results and Live Play-by-Play |work=MMAWeekly.com |date=October 23, 2008}}</ref> The Brazilian's improved takedown-defense was once again on display, as the American Top Team fighter forced Koscheck into a kick boxing battle. Alves' devastating leg kicks proved to be a factor throughout the bout, taking away much of Koscheck's mobility. He also managed to drop Koscheck several times during the 3-round bout, but Koscheck's quick recovery enabled him to survive the onslaughts.<ref>{{cite web |first=Robert |last=Rousseau |url=http://www.mmafighting.com/news/2008/10/26/ufc-90-review-anderson-silva-retains-title |title=UFC 90 Review: Anderson Silva retains title |work=MMAFighting.com |date=October 25, 2008 |accessdate=February 15, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029204619/http://www.mmafighting.com/news/2008/10/26/ufc-90-review-anderson-silva-retains-title |archivedate=October 29, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Welterweight title shot===\nWith his impressive victory over Koscheck, Alves was on a 7-fight win streak, winning 9 of his past 10 bouts.

{"title_page": "Ellen Robbins", "text_new": "{{Short description|American botanical illustrator}}\n[[File:Wild Flowers No. 1 (Boston Public Library).jpg|thumb|''Wild Flowers No. 1'', chromolithograph (Boston Public Library)]]\n\n'''Ellen Robbins''' (1828 \u2013 1905) was a 19th-century American botanical illustrator known for paintings of wildflowers and autumn leaves.\nShe was one of the contributors to the first annual exhibition of the [[American Watercolor Society]] in 1867/1868.<ref name=\"Foster\">{{cite book|last1=Foster|first1=Kathleen A.|title=American Watercolor in the Age of Homer and Sargent|date=2017|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300225891|page=55}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Ellen Robbins 1870 Autumn Leaves.jpg|thumb|''Autumn Leaves'' ca. 1870, Philadelphia Museum of Art]]\n\nBorn in 1828 in [[Watertown, Massachusetts]], Ellen Robbins was the youngest child of a factory owner who died when she was still a child. His factory subsequently burned down, and the combination of events left the family in straitened circumstances. Robbins began trying to help the family's finances by getting work while still very young.<ref name=ejv/> After trying various domestic arts, she turned to watercolor painting. Although she received some training from an artist named [[Stephen Salisbury Tuckerman]], she was largely self-taught.<ref name=kja/>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Asters (Boston Public Library).jpg|thumb|''Asters'', chromolithograph (Boston Public Library)]]\nIn her twenties, Robbins began producing books of flower illustrations and selling them for the then very substantial sum of $25 each. Her success with these led her to broaden out from flowers to autumn leaves.<ref name=ejv/> She was known for work so realistic that, as one contemporary wrote, bees might light on her flowers. Similarly, her leaf paintings are still occasionally mistaken for real leaves by viewers.<ref name=ejv/> The art historian Samuel Benjamin considered her \"one of the finest still life painters in America.\"<ref name=jama/><ref name=sb/> Another art historian, however, has compared the \"harsh edges and forthright local color\"<ref name=dpc/> of Robbins's flower paintings unfavorably to the work of [[Childe Hassam]], yet those are precisely the qualities that her fans admire.\n\nIn addition to publishing books, Robbins sold original paintings through a shop in Boston. Her work became fashionable in both America and England, and she began painting botanical designs on china and even furniture for her clients. In the 1840s, she began creating textile designs, as well as designs for tiles and needlework.<ref name=kja/> In the 1840s, she began also to teach watercolor painting.<ref name=kja/>\n\nIn the late 1860s, after the introduction of [[chromolithography]], the lithographer [[Louis Prang]] hired her to create a series of flowers and autumn leaves specifically to be sold as prints.<ref name=kja/><ref name=bfb/> Through contacts among prominent Bostonians like [[Henry Ward Beecher]], she was invited to create a frieze (since destroyed) at [[Wellesley College]] outside Boston.<ref name=ejv/>\n\nWith increasing success, Robbins was able to travel abroad and to take time off in the summer, when she often spent time in Maine with the writer [[Celia Thaxter]].<ref name=ejv/> She became one of the first of a series of prominent artists who stayed at Thaxter's Appledore House hotel, where she painted the flowers in its famous garden.<ref name=kja/>\n\nAn inscription on one of her paintings suggests that she got married in 1858, but her husband's name is not recorded.<ref name=ejv/>\n\nIn 1896, she published a series of articles in ''New England Magazine'' reflecting on her life, entitled \"Reminiscences of a Flower Painter.\"\n\n==Publications==\n*''Autumnal Leaves'' (1868, 18 watercolors)\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Purple Wisteria (Boston Public Library).jpg|''Purple Wisteria'', chromolithograph (Boston Public Library)\nFile:Hyacinths (Boston Public Library).jpg|''Hyacinths'', chromolithograph (Boston Public Library)\nFile:Wild Flowers No. 2 (Boston Public Library).jpg|''Wild Flowers No. 2'', chromolithograph (Boston Public Library)\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=ejv>Valauskas, Edward J.

His factory subsequently burned down, and the combination of events left the family in straitened circumstances. Robbins began trying to help the family's finances by getting work while still very young.<ref name=ejv/> After trying various domestic arts, she turned to watercolor painting. Although she received some training from an artist named [[Stephen Salisbury Tuckerman]], she was largely self-taught.<ref name=kja/>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Asters (Boston Public Library).jpg|thumb|''Asters'', chromolithograph (Boston Public Library)]]\nIn her twenties, Robbins began producing books of flower illustrations and selling them for the then very substantial sum of $25 each. Her success with these led her to broaden out from flowers to autumn leaves.<ref name=ejv/> She was known for work so realistic that, as one contemporary wrote, bees might light on her flowers. Similarly, her leaf paintings are still occasionally mistaken for real leaves by viewers.<ref name=ejv/> The art historian Samuel Benjamin considered her \"one of the finest still life painters in America.\"<ref name=jama/><ref name=sb/> Another art historian, however, has compared the \"harsh edges and forthright local color\"<ref name=dpc/> of Robbins's flower paintings unfavorably to the work of [[Childe Hassam]], yet those are precisely the qualities that her fans admire.\n\nIn addition to publishing books, Robbins sold original paintings through a shop in Boston. Her work became fashionable in both America and England, and she began painting botanical designs on china and even furniture for her clients. In the 1840s, she began creating textile designs, as well as designs for tiles and needlework.<ref name=kja/> In the 1840s, she began also to teach watercolor painting.<ref name=kja/>\n\nIn the late 1860s, after the introduction of [[chromolithography]], the lithographer [[Louis Prang]] hired her to create a series of flowers and autumn leaves specifically to be sold as prints.<ref name=kja/><ref name=bfb/> Through contacts among prominent Bostonians like [[Henry Ward Beecher]], she was invited to create a frieze (since destroyed) at [[Wellesley College]] outside Boston.<ref name=ejv/>\n\nWith increasing success, Robbins was able to travel abroad and to take time off in the summer, when she often spent time in Maine with the writer [[Celia Thaxter]].<ref name=ejv/> She became one of the first of a series of prominent artists who stayed at Thaxter's Appledore House hotel, where she painted the flowers in its famous garden.<ref name=kja/>\n\nAn inscription on one of her paintings suggests that she got married in 1858, but her husband's name is not recorded.<ref name=ejv/>\n\nIn 1896, she published a series of articles in ''New England Magazine'' reflecting on her life, entitled \"Reminiscences of a Flower Painter.\"\n\n==Publications==\n*''Autumnal Leaves'' (1868, 18 watercolors)\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Purple Wisteria (Boston Public Library).jpg|''Purple Wisteria'', chromolithograph (Boston Public Library)\nFile:Hyacinths (Boston Public Library).jpg|''Hyacinths'', chromolithograph (Boston Public Library)\nFile:Wild Flowers No. 2 (Boston Public Library).jpg|''Wild Flowers No. 2'', chromolithograph (Boston Public Library)\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=ejv>Valauskas, Edward J.
