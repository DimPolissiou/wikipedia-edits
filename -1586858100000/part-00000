Encomiendas were organized only for the purposes of collecting tribute that went in part to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the Spanish army, and to the Royal Treasury. Later on areas which were organized and given the designation of \"province\" (''provincia'') were led by an appointed ''[[alcalde]]'' who performed judicial, fiscal and executive functions. This system of government lasted for almost three hundred years until 1886 when a governor (''gobernador'') was first appointed in each of the eighteen existing provinces, relegating the alcalde to carry out only judicial functions.<ref name=\"civil\">{{cite book |title=Civil Government in the Philippines |last=McGovney |first=Dudley Odell |page=129 |year=1903 |isbn=978-0-559-69396-0 |publisher=BiblioBazaar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rKSCOjrNJyMC}}</ref>\n\n[[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)|American rule]] brought radical changes to the system of local government in the country. In 1901 the [[Philippine Commission]] enacted Act No. 83, known as the Provincial Government Act, which outlined the powers, responsibilities and composition of the provincial government. Each regularly organized province was provided a '''Provincial Board''' composed of three provincial officials: the governor, the treasurer, and a \"third member\" who in most cases was known as the supervisor. The governor in regularly organized provinces under civilian control were initially elected by municipal vice-presidents and councilors within the province through a convention held in the provincial capital every even-numbered year.<ref name=\"civil\" /> As civil government took hold, the governorship was made elective. The composition of provincial boards were also later modified, with the treasurer and \"third member\" taken out and replaced by two members elected by popular vote. Not all provinces had the same type of government. Officials in specially organized provinces (those termed \"Non-Christian provinces\") were appointed by the [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] with the approval of the Philippine Commission<ref>{{cite book |title=The Philippines: Past and Present |last=Worcester |first=Dean C. |page=341 |year=1914 |isbn=978-1-4264-5850-7 |publisher=BiblioBazaar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0K5Tn28PcrcC}}</ref> until legislation gradually brought each of them in line with regularly organized provinces, that by the time of independence in 1946 all provinces had largely similar governments.\n\nThe passage of Republic Act No. 2264 (the \"Local Autonomy Act\") on June 19, 1959 not only granted greater autonomy to local governments, but also expanded the composition of the Provincial Board by creating a new elective office, the vice-governorship, as well as providing for provinces of the first, second and third income class to have one additional elected board member.<ref>[http://laws.chanrobles.com/ph/ra/republicactno2264.html Republic Act No. 2264 - Local Autonomy Act], Chan-Robles Law Library.</ref> However, the Board still had limited real legislative powers, as the provincial government was merely serving as an extension of national government.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=ABA Journal |publisher=American Bar Association |volume=52 |number=2 |title=Constitutional Law in the Philippines |author=Eric Daenecke |page=162 |date=February 1966 |issn=0747-0088 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=30UsLWMjJLcC}}</ref> Republic Act No. 5185 was enacted in 1967 with the intention of decentralizing authority and further empowering local governments to address the needs of their constituents more effectively.<ref>[http://laws.chanrobles.com/ph/ra/republicactno5185.html Republic Act No. 5185 - Decentralization Act of 1967], Chan-Robles Law Library.</ref>\n\nBy virtue of Presidential Decree No. 826 issued by [[Philippine president|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] on November 14, 1975<ref name=\"pd826\">[http://www.chanrobles.com/presidentialdecrees/presidentialdecreeno826.html Presidential Decree No. 826], Chan-Robles Law Library</ref> all existing governing boards and councils in each province, city and municipality were renamed '''Sangguniang Bayan'''. The province-level Sangguniang Bayan (later given the name '''Sangguniang Panlalawigan''',<ref>[http://www.chanrobles.com/presidentialdecrees/presidentialdecreeno925.html Presidential Decree No. 925], Chan-Robles Law Library.</ref> commonly abbreviated to '''SP''') consisted of all the incumbent provincial board members (including the governor and vice-governor), plus a representative from each municipality within the province, and the provincial president of the ''[[Katipunan ng Mga Kabataang Barangay]]'' or Association of Barangay Youth.<ref name=\"pd826\" />\n\nBatas Pambansa Blg. 51, enacted in 1979, standardized the composition of all provincial legislatures by reducing the membership of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan. All provinces were entitled to 6 elective SP members, unless they had more than one million residents (8 members) or less than 100,000 residents (4 members). Direct municipal representation was eliminated, and in its place was indirect \"grassroots\" representation through the president of the provincial [[association of barangay chairmen]] who was appointed by the President, who also happened to be the [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]]. Other members of the new Sanggunian were the governor and the vice governor, both elected by popular vote, and the president of the provincial federation of the Kabataang Barangay, appointed by the President/Prime Minister.<ref>[http://www.chanrobles.com/bataspambansa/bataspambansablg51.html Batas Pambansa Blg. 51]</ref> \n\nThe powers and duties of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan was codified under Batas Pambansa Blg. 337, also known as the Local Government Code of 1983. The governor served as an ''ex officio'' member, who did not vote except only to break a tie, but had the power to veto items within, or entire, Sanggunian ordinances and resolutions. However the veto can be overridden by a two-thirds vote of all voting SP members.<ref name=\"lgc83\">[http://www.chanrobles.com/bataspambansa/bataspambansablg337.html Batas Pambansa Blg. 337 - Local Government Code of 1983], Chan-Robles Law Library.</ref>\n\nThe Sangguniang Panlalawigan was retained as the legislative branch of all provincial governments under the 1987 Constitution and the Local Government Code of 1991. However, unlike the old Provincial Boards or the pre-1992 Sanggunian, which included in their memberships provincial executives, under current laws the governor is not considered as a Sanggunian member (although he or she retains the power to veto SP legislation, which can still be overridden by a two-thirds vote of all voting members), and the vice-governor, who has now become the presiding officer, only participates in breaking ties in voting. Since 1992 SP members are elected from districts to ensure geographical representation, and the size of the province's Sanggunian was dependent on its income classification rather than population.<ref name=\"lgc\" />\n\n==Powers, duties, and functions==\nThe powers, duties, and functions of the Sanggunian are outlined in Section 468 of the Local Government Code of 1991.<ref name=\"lgc\" /> The legislative body is tasked in general to ''\"enact ordinances, approve resolutions and appropriate funds for the general welfare of the province and its inhabitants... in the proper exercise of the corporate powers of the province.\"'' Its powers, duties and functions are outlined into five broad mandates:\n*''\"Approve ordinances and pass resolutions necessary for an efficient and effective provincial government,\"'' which includes:\n**Reviewing all ordinances approved by the [[Sangguniang Panlungsod]] and [[Sangguniang Bayan]] of the province's component cities and municipalities to ensure that they and their mayors are within their scope of powers as outlined in the Local Government Code\n**Enacting measures to maintain peace and order and imposing penalties on violations of such ordinances\n**Approving ordinances that impose fines and/or imprisonment for violations of provincial ordinances\n**Adopt measures to protect the inhabitants of the province from harmful effects of man-made or natural disasters, and provide relief services and assistance for victims not only during and in the aftermath of disasters and calamities, but also in their \"return to productive livelihood\" following the events\n**Enacting ordinances intended to prevent, suppress and impose appropriate penalties for \"activities inimical to the welfare and morals of the inhabitants of the province,\" such as prostitution, juvenile delinquency and drug addiction.\n**Protect the environment and impose appropriate penalties for acts which endanger the environment\n**Determine the powers and duties of officials and employees of the province in accordance with the Local Government Code and pertinent laws, and also determine their wages, salaries, allowances, honorariums, compensation and other emoluments and benefits, and provide for expenditures necessary to properly carry out programs, projects, services and activities of the provincial government\n**Provide a mechanism (and appropriate funding for it) to ensure the safety and protection of all provincial government property, public documents and records\n**When the finances of the provincial government allow, provide for additional allowances or other benefits to officials and public servants working in the province\n*''\"Generate and maximize the use of resources and revenues for the development plans, program objectives and priorities of the province... with particular attention to agro-industrial development and country-wide growth and progress and relative thereto,\"'' which involve the following:\n**Enact annual and supplemental appropriations of the provincial government and appropriate funds for specific programs, projects, services and activities of the province, or for other purposes not contrary to law, in order to promote the general welfare of the province and its inhabitants\n**Subject to the provisions of Book II of the Local Government Code and applicable laws and upon the majority vote of all the members of the sangguniang panlalawigan:\n***Enact ordinances levying taxes, fees and charges, prescribing the rates thereof for general and specific purposes, and granting tax exemptions, incentives or reliefs\n***Authorize the provincial governor to negotiate and contract loans and other forms of indebtedness\n***Enact ordinances authorizing the floating of bonds or other instruments of indebtedness, for the purpose of raising funds to finance development projects\n**Appropriate funds for the construction and maintenance or the rental of buildings for the use of the province;

The provincial vice-governor serves as its presiding officer, who does not vote except in cases to break a tie.\n\nRegularly elected members are elected from Sangguniang Panlalawigan districts. The total number of SP members to be elected within the province, and the number within each SP district, varies depending on several factors, including the province's income class and the population count within districts.\n\n''Ex officio'' members in the Sanggunian include:\n* the president of the provincial chapter of the [[Liga ng mga Barangay]]\n* the president of the provincial federation of Youth Councils ([[Sangguniang Kabataan]])\n* the president of the provincial federation of [[Sangguniang Panlungsod]] and [[Sangguniang Bayan]] members from component cities and municipalities\n* the ''IP Representative'' is pursuant to the Republic Act 8371, or the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act of 1997, which calls for the mandatory representation of IPs which is formally certified by the concerned NCIP regional director, upon recommendation of the provincial or community service center head and shall serve for a period of three years from the date of assumption to office and can be re-indorsed for another term as long as he or she would not serve for more than three consecutive terms.\n\nThe Local Government Code of 1991 also provides for the election of 3 \"sectoral representatives,\"<ref name=\"lgc\" /> which are supposed to come from:\n* women's sector\n* agricultural or industrial sector\n* other sectors, including the disabled, the urban poor, or indigenous cultural communities\n\nAlthough several attempts have been made in the past to provide for the election of these sectoral representatives, the lack of a more concrete enabling law upon which the manner of election of these sectoral representatives can be legally based continues to prevent this feature of local governments from being fully realized.<ref name=\"secrep\">[http://www.saligan.org/docs/Local%20Sectoral%20Representation,%20A%20Legal%20Analysis.pdf Local Sectoral Representation: A Legal Analysis].</ref>\n\n==Allocation and apportionment of regularly elected members==\n[[File:Philippine provinces by income classification.PNG|thumb|Provinces based on number of regular Sangguniang Panlalawigan seats: greens at least 10, blues 8, and reds 6.]]\n\nThe number of regular Sanggunian members is based on the income of the province as classified by the [[Department of Finance (Philippines)|Department of Finance]]. The [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] issues resolutions allocating the number of regular members of the Sanggunian a province may elect should a province's income classification change. First-class and second-class provinces are entitled to 10 regularly elected members, 8 for third- and fourth-class provinces and 6 for fifth- and sixth-class provinces. Exceptions to the rule are provinces which are divided into more than five [[Legislative districts of the Philippines|congressional districts]]. Each Sangguniang Panlalawigan district in the provinces of [[Batangas]], [[Cavite (province)|Cavite]], [[Cebu (province)|Cebu]], [[Negros Occidental]] and [[Pangasinan]] elect two members to the Sanggunian, resulting in a total number of 16 regularly elected SP members in Cavite, 14 in Cebu, and 12 in the three other provinces.\n\nThe Commission on Elections apportions the number of Sanggunian members among the SP districts into which the province is divided. As much as possible, the members are equally divided among the legislative districts. If such equal division is impossible the remaining numbers are assigned to the districts with a bigger population count than the others. The COMELEC likewise factors out the population of [[Cities of the Philippines#Independent cities|independent cities]] which do not elect provincial officials in determining the apportionment of the Sanggunian members among the districts. Provinces comprising a single congressional district are divided into two sanggunian districts by the COMELEC for purposes of electing SP members.\n\nA majority of Sangguniang Panlalawigan districts are contiguous to existing [[Legislative districts of the Philippines|congressional districts]]. The exceptions are the following:\n* Provinces which comprise a lone congressional district are divided into two Sanggunian districts by the COMELEC.\n* Independent cities which are not allowed to participate in provincial politics are factored out of the congressional districts that contain them: [[Angeles, Pampanga|Angeles]] from [[Legislative districts of Pampanga#1st District|Pampanga\u20141st]], [[Butuan]] from [[Legislative districts of Agusan del Norte#1st District|Agusan del Norte\u20141st]], [[Cotabato City]] from [[Legislative districts of Maguindanao#1st District|Maguindanao\u20141st]], [[Dagupan]] from [[Legislative districts of Pangasinan#4th District|Pangasinan\u20144th]], [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga]] from [[Legislative districts of Camarines Sur#3rd District|Camarines Sur\u20143rd]], [[Ormoc]] from [[Legislative districts of Leyte#4th District|4th]], [[Puerto Princesa]] from [[Legislative districts of Palawan#3rd District|Palawan\u20143rd]], [[Santiago, Isabela|Santiago]] from [[Legislative districts of Isabela#4th District|Isabela\u20144th]], and [[Tacloban]] from [[Legislative districts of Leyte#1st District|Leyte\u20141st]]\n* The 4th SP district of [[Bulacan (province)|Bulacan]] encompasses the entire [[Legislative districts of Bulacan#4th District|4th Congressional district of Bulacan]] plus the city of [[San Jose del Monte]], which in 2004 started to elect [[Legislative district of San Jose del Monte City|its own congressional representative]] but was not separated by law to constitute its own Sangguniang Panlalawigan district.\n* The 1st SP district of [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] encompasses the entire [[Legislative districts of Laguna#1st District|1st Congressional district of Laguna]] plus the city of [[Bi\u00f1an]], which in 2016 started to elect [[Legislative district of Bi\u00f1an|its own congressional representative]] but was not separated by law to constitute its own Sangguniang Panlalawigan district.\n* The 2nd SP district of [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] encompasses the entire [[Legislative districts of Laguna#2nd District|2nd Congressional district of Laguna]] plus the city of [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]], which in 2019 started to elect [[Legislative district of Calamba|its own congressional representative]] but was not separated by law to constitute its own Sangguniang Panlalawigan district.\n* The [[Legislative districts of Antipolo#1st District|1st]] and [[Legislative districts of Antipolo#2nd District|2nd]] Congressional districts of [[Antipolo]] also serve ''de facto'' as SP districts of [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]], with each being allocated one regular SP member.\n\n==List==\nThe following is a table with the number of members elected from each SP district, showing the apportionment in place for the [[2019 Philippine general election|2019 elections]].\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin: auto; font-size:92%;\" \n|+\n!rowspan=2|Province\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Article\n! colspan=\"8\" |Provincial board district\n!rowspan=2|''Ex<br>officio''\n!rowspan=2|Total\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Vice governors\n|-\n!1st\n!2nd\n!3rd\n!4th\n!5th\n!6th\n!7th\n!8th\n|-\n|[[Abra (province)|Abra]]||[[Abra Provincial Board|Board]]||4||4||  ||  ||  ||  || \n|  ||3||11\n|Ronald Balao-as\n|-\n|[[Agusan del Norte]]||[[Agusan del Norte Provincial Board|Board]]||1||7||  ||  ||  ||  || \n|  ||3||11\n|Ramon Bungabong\n|-\n|[[Agusan del Sur]]||[[Agusan del Sur Provincial Board|Board]]||5||5||  ||  ||  ||  || \n|  ||3||13\n|Samuel Tortor\n|-\n|[[Aklan]]||[[Aklan Provincial Board|Board]]||5||5||  ||  ||  ||  || \n|  ||3||13\n|Reynaldo Quimpo\n|-\n|[[Albay]]||[[Albay Provincial Board|Board]]||3||3||4||  ||  ||  || \n|  ||3||13\n|Harold Imperial\n|-\n|[[Antique (province)|Antique]]||[[Antique Provincial Board|Board]]||5||5||  ||  ||  ||  || \n|  ||3||13\n|Edgar Denosta\n|-\n|[[Apayao]]||[[Apayao Provincial Board|Board]]||4||4||  ||  ||  ||  || \n|  ||3||11\n|Remy Albano\n|-\n|[[Aurora (province)|Aurora]]||[[Aurora Provincial Board|Board]]||4||4||  ||  ||  ||  || \n|  ||3||11\n|Rommel Angara\n|-\n|[[Basilan]]||[[Basilan Provincial Board|Board]]||4||4||  ||  ||  ||  || \n|  ||3||11\n|Yusop Alano\n|-\n|[[Bataan]]||[[Bataan Provincial Board|Board]]||5||5||  ||  ||  ||  || \n|  ||3||13\n|Enrique Garcia\n|-\n|[[Batanes]]||[[Batanes Provincial Board|Board]]||3||3||  ||  ||  ||  || \n|  ||3||9\n|Ronald Aguto\n|-\n|[[Batangas]]||[[Batangas Provincial Board|Board]]||2||2||2||2||2||2|| \n|  ||3||15\n|[[Mark Leviste]]\n|-\n|[[Benguet]]||[[Benguet Provincial Board|Board]]||4||6||  ||  ||  ||  || \n|  ||3||13\n|Florence Tingbaoen\n|-\n|[[Biliran]]||[[Biliran Provincial Board|Board]]||4||4||  ||  ||  ||  || \n|  ||3||11\n|Eriberto Tubis, Jr.\n|-\n|[[Bohol]]||[[Bohol Provincial Board|Board]]||3||3||4||  ||  ||  || \n|  ||3||13\n|Dionisio Balite\n|-\n|[[Bukidnon]]||[[Bukidnon Provincial Board|Board]]||2||3||3||2||  ||  || \n|  ||4||14\n|Rogelio N.

Encomiendas were organized only for the purposes of collecting tribute that went in part to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the Spanish army, and to the Royal Treasury. Later on areas which were organized and given the designation of \"province\" (''provincia'') were led by an appointed ''[[alcalde]]'' who performed judicial, fiscal and executive functions. This system of government lasted for almost three hundred years until 1886 when a governor (''gobernador'') was first appointed in each of the eighteen existing provinces, relegating the alcalde to carry out only judicial functions.<ref name=\"civil\">{{cite book |title=Civil Government in the Philippines |last=McGovney |first=Dudley Odell |page=129 |year=1903 |isbn=978-0-559-69396-0 |publisher=BiblioBazaar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rKSCOjrNJyMC}}</ref>\n\n[[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)|American rule]] brought radical changes to the system of local government in the country. In 1901 the [[Philippine Commission]] enacted Act No. 83, known as the Provincial Government Act, which outlined the powers, responsibilities and composition of the provincial government. Each regularly organized province was provided a '''Provincial Board''' composed of three provincial officials: the governor, the treasurer, and a \"third member\" who in most cases was known as the supervisor. The governor in regularly organized provinces under civilian control were initially elected by municipal vice-presidents and councilors within the province through a convention held in the provincial capital every even-numbered year.<ref name=\"civil\" /> As civil government took hold, the governorship was made elective. The composition of provincial boards were also later modified, with the treasurer and \"third member\" taken out and replaced by two members elected by popular vote. Not all provinces had the same type of government. Officials in specially organized provinces (those termed \"Non-Christian provinces\") were appointed by the [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] with the approval of the Philippine Commission<ref>{{cite book |title=The Philippines: Past and Present |last=Worcester |first=Dean C. |page=341 |year=1914 |isbn=978-1-4264-5850-7 |publisher=BiblioBazaar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0K5Tn28PcrcC}}</ref> until legislation gradually brought each of them in line with regularly organized provinces, that by the time of independence in 1946 all provinces had largely similar governments.\n\nThe passage of Republic Act No. 2264 (the \"Local Autonomy Act\") on June 19, 1959 not only granted greater autonomy to local governments, but also expanded the composition of the Provincial Board by creating a new elective office, the vice-governorship, as well as providing for provinces of the first, second and third income class to have one additional elected board member.<ref>[http://laws.chanrobles.com/ph/ra/republicactno2264.html Republic Act No. 2264 - Local Autonomy Act], Chan-Robles Law Library.</ref> However, the Board still had limited real legislative powers, as the provincial government was merely serving as an extension of national government.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=ABA Journal |publisher=American Bar Association |volume=52 |number=2 |title=Constitutional Law in the Philippines |author=Eric Daenecke |page=162 |date=February 1966 |issn=0747-0088 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=30UsLWMjJLcC}}</ref> Republic Act No. 5185 was enacted in 1967 with the intention of decentralizing authority and further empowering local governments to address the needs of their constituents more effectively.<ref>[http://laws.chanrobles.com/ph/ra/republicactno5185.html Republic Act No. 5185 - Decentralization Act of 1967], Chan-Robles Law Library.</ref>\n\nBy virtue of Presidential Decree No. 826 issued by [[Philippine president|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] on November 14, 1975<ref name=\"pd826\">[http://www.chanrobles.com/presidentialdecrees/presidentialdecreeno826.html Presidential Decree No. 826], Chan-Robles Law Library</ref> all existing governing boards and councils in each province, city and municipality were renamed '''Sangguniang Bayan'''. The province-level Sangguniang Bayan (later given the name '''Sangguniang Panlalawigan''',<ref>[http://www.chanrobles.com/presidentialdecrees/presidentialdecreeno925.html Presidential Decree No. 925], Chan-Robles Law Library.</ref> commonly abbreviated to '''SP''') consisted of all the incumbent provincial board members (including the governor and vice-governor), plus a representative from each municipality within the province, and the provincial president of the ''[[Katipunan ng Mga Kabataang Barangay]]'' or Association of Barangay Youth.<ref name=\"pd826\" />\n\nBatas Pambansa Blg. 51, enacted in 1979, standardized the composition of all provincial legislatures by reducing the membership of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan. All provinces were entitled to 6 elective SP members, unless they had more than one million residents (8 members) or less than 100,000 residents (4 members). Direct municipal representation was eliminated, and in its place was indirect \"grassroots\" representation through the president of the provincial [[association of barangay chairmen]] who was appointed by the President, who also happened to be the [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]]. Other members of the new Sanggunian were the governor and the vice governor, both elected by popular vote, and the president of the provincial federation of the Kabataang Barangay, appointed by the President/Prime Minister.<ref>[http://www.chanrobles.com/bataspambansa/bataspambansablg51.html Batas Pambansa Blg. 51]</ref> \n\nThe powers and duties of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan was codified under Batas Pambansa Blg. 337, also known as the Local Government Code of 1983. The governor served as an ''ex officio'' member, who did not vote except only to break a tie, but had the power to veto items within, or entire, Sanggunian ordinances and resolutions. However the veto can be overridden by a two-thirds vote of all voting SP members.<ref name=\"lgc83\">[http://www.chanrobles.com/bataspambansa/bataspambansablg337.html Batas Pambansa Blg. 337 - Local Government Code of 1983], Chan-Robles Law Library.</ref>\n\nThe Sangguniang Panlalawigan was retained as the legislative branch of all provincial governments under the 1987 Constitution and the Local Government Code of 1991. However, unlike the old Provincial Boards or the pre-1992 Sanggunian, which included in their memberships provincial executives, under current laws the governor is not considered as a Sanggunian member (although he or she retains the power to veto SP legislation, which can still be overridden by a two-thirds vote of all voting members), and the vice-governor, who has now become the presiding officer, only participates in breaking ties in voting. Since 1992 SP members are elected from districts to ensure geographical representation, and the size of the province's Sanggunian was dependent on its income classification rather than population.<ref name=\"lgc\" />\n\n==Powers, duties, and functions==\nThe powers, duties, and functions of the Sanggunian are outlined in Section 468 of the Local Government Code of 1991.<ref name=\"lgc\" /> The legislative body is tasked in general to ''\"enact ordinances, approve resolutions and appropriate funds for the general welfare of the province and its inhabitants... in the proper exercise of the corporate powers of the province.\"'' Its powers, duties and functions are outlined into five broad mandates:\n*''\"Approve ordinances and pass resolutions necessary for an efficient and effective provincial government,\"'' which includes:\n**Reviewing all ordinances approved by the [[Sangguniang Panlungsod]] and [[Sangguniang Bayan]] of the province's component cities and municipalities to ensure that they and their mayors are within their scope of powers as outlined in the Local Government Code\n**Enacting measures to maintain peace and order and imposing penalties on violations of such ordinances\n**Approving ordinances that impose fines and/or imprisonment for violations of provincial ordinances\n**Adopt measures to protect the inhabitants of the province from harmful effects of man-made or natural disasters, and provide relief services and assistance for victims not only during and in the aftermath of disasters and calamities, but also in their \"return to productive livelihood\" following the events\n**Enacting ordinances intended to prevent, suppress and impose appropriate penalties for \"activities inimical to the welfare and morals of the inhabitants of the province,\" such as prostitution, juvenile delinquency and drug addiction.\n**Protect the environment and impose appropriate penalties for acts which endanger the environment\n**Determine the powers and duties of officials and employees of the province in accordance with the Local Government Code and pertinent laws, and also determine their wages, salaries, allowances, honorariums, compensation and other emoluments and benefits, and provide for expenditures necessary to properly carry out programs, projects, services and activities of the provincial government\n**Provide a mechanism (and appropriate funding for it) to ensure the safety and protection of all provincial government property, public documents and records\n**When the finances of the provincial government allow, provide for additional allowances or other benefits to officials and public servants working in the province\n*''\"Generate and maximize the use of resources and revenues for the development plans, program objectives and priorities of the province... with particular attention to agro-industrial development and country-wide growth and progress and relative thereto,\"'' which involve the following:\n**Enact annual and supplemental appropriations of the provincial government and appropriate funds for specific programs, projects, services and activities of the province, or for other purposes not contrary to law, in order to promote the general welfare of the province and its inhabitants\n**Subject to the provisions of Book II of the Local Government Code and applicable laws and upon the majority vote of all the members of the sangguniang panlalawigan:\n***Enact ordinances levying taxes, fees and charges, prescribing the rates thereof for general and specific purposes, and granting tax exemptions, incentives or reliefs\n***Authorize the provincial governor to negotiate and contract loans and other forms of indebtedness\n***Enact ordinances authorizing the floating of bonds or other instruments of indebtedness, for the purpose of raising funds to finance development projects\n**Appropriate funds for the construction and maintenance or the rental of buildings for the use of the province;

The provincial vice-governor serves as its presiding officer, who does not vote except in cases to break a tie.\n\nRegularly elected members are elected from Sangguniang Panlalawigan districts. The total number of SP members to be elected within the province, and the number within each SP district, varies depending on several factors, including the province's income class and the population count within districts.\n\n''Ex officio'' members in the Sanggunian include:\n* the president of the provincial chapter of the [[Liga ng mga Barangay]]\n* the president of the provincial federation of Youth Councils ([[Sangguniang Kabataan]])\n* the president of the provincial federation of [[Sangguniang Panlungsod]] and [[Sangguniang Bayan]] members from component cities and municipalities\n* the ''IP Representative'' is pursuant to the Republic Act 8371, or the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act of 1997, which calls for the mandatory representation of IPs which is formally certified by the concerned NCIP regional director, upon recommendation of the provincial or community service center head and shall serve for a period of three years from the date of assumption to office and can be re-indorsed for another term as long as he or she would not serve for more than three consecutive terms.\n\nThe Local Government Code of 1991 also provides for the election of 3 \"sectoral representatives,\"<ref name=\"lgc\" /> which are supposed to come from:\n* women's sector\n* agricultural or industrial sector\n* other sectors, including the disabled, the urban poor, or indigenous cultural communities\n\nAlthough several attempts have been made in the past to provide for the election of these sectoral representatives, the lack of a more concrete enabling law upon which the manner of election of these sectoral representatives can be legally based continues to prevent this feature of local governments from being fully realized.<ref name=\"secrep\">[http://www.saligan.org/docs/Local%20Sectoral%20Representation,%20A%20Legal%20Analysis.pdf Local Sectoral Representation: A Legal Analysis].</ref>\n\n==Allocation and apportionment of regularly elected members==\n[[File:Philippine provinces by income classification.PNG|thumb|Provinces based on number of regular Sangguniang Panlalawigan seats: greens at least 10, blues 8, and reds 6.]]\n\nThe number of regular Sanggunian members is based on the income of the province as classified by the [[Department of Finance (Philippines)|Department of Finance]]. The [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] issues resolutions allocating the number of regular members of the Sanggunian a province may elect should a province's income classification change. First-class and second-class provinces are entitled to 10 regularly elected members, 8 for third- and fourth-class provinces and 6 for fifth- and sixth-class provinces. Exceptions to the rule are provinces which are divided into more than five [[Legislative districts of the Philippines|congressional districts]]. Each Sangguniang Panlalawigan district in the provinces of [[Batangas]], [[Cavite (province)|Cavite]], [[Cebu (province)|Cebu]], [[Negros Occidental]] and [[Pangasinan]] elect two members to the Sanggunian, resulting in a total number of 16 regularly elected SP members in Cavite, 14 in Cebu, and 12 in the three other provinces.\n\nThe Commission on Elections apportions the number of Sanggunian members among the SP districts into which the province is divided. As much as possible, the members are equally divided among the legislative districts. If such equal division is impossible the remaining numbers are assigned to the districts with a bigger population count than the others. The COMELEC likewise factors out the population of [[Cities of the Philippines#Independent cities|independent cities]] which do not elect provincial officials in determining the apportionment of the Sanggunian members among the districts. Provinces comprising a single congressional district are divided into two sanggunian districts by the COMELEC for purposes of electing SP members.\n\nA majority of Sangguniang Panlalawigan districts are contiguous to existing [[Legislative districts of the Philippines|congressional districts]].

He said \"Good Stefan doesn't feel as natural in terms of what I want to be doing on screen, and what I want to be saying.

Stefan is the younger brother of Damon. When Stefan and Damon were human, they were very close and were best friends in life. Damon always confided and trusted in Stefan and they always defended each other, especially to their father, and was fiercely loyal to him. However, this all seemed to change when Stefan and Damon fell in love with the same girl, Katherine Pierce, who turned out to be a vampire. Stefan fell deeply in love with Katherine before finding out she was a vampire. Katherine, however, compelled Stefan to not be afraid, also to keep her secret and go on as they were. It was also revealed that Katherine compelled Stefan to drink her vampire blood against his will. Damon, on the other hand, drank Katherine's blood willingly, wanting and desiring the immortal life in order to spend an eternity with Katherine. In 1864, Stefan was turned into a vampire after being shot by his father, Giuseppe, along with his brother, Damon with Katherine's blood in his system, before accidentally killing his father during a visit to tell him that he was going to let himself die. Damon, who turned into a vampire as well, promised Stefan an eternity of misery as he was angry that Stefan had forced him to turn and jealous that Katherine had also turned Stefan. A newborn vampire with uncontrollable blood lust, Stefan was unable to resist the temptations of human blood and became severely out of control and addicted (later on known as the Ripper) to the blood, killing many people because of his lack of control and extreme bloodlust. However, Stefan learned to change his ways when he was taught to control it by a vampire named Alexia \"Lexi\" Branson, who later on became Stefan's best friend and companion. In 1942, Stefan enlisted in the Army to fight in [[World War II]] (4x08 \"We'll Always Have Bourbon Street\"). After decades of absence from the town he called home, Stefan returned to Mystic Falls to visit his home and Zach. On May 23, 2009, Stefan heard the Gilbert's car accident at Wickery Bridge. It was then and there that Stefan fatefully encountered Elena Gilbert for the first time. After only being able to save Elena, Stefan noticed that she looked exactly like Katherine.\n\n===Storyline===\n\n====Season 1-3====\nStefan and Elena begin a relationship and he revealed to her that he is a vampire. However, Damon returns to Mystic Falls, too, and also falls in love with Elena. Further on in the series, Damon and Stefan start to bond as brothers again and it becomes apparent that they do love each other. Because of his addiction to human blood, Stefan only drank animal blood in the beginning of the series, which made him weaker than other vampires. In season two, Stefan starts to take small amounts of Elena's blood each day to mitigate its effect on him and to increase his strength. When Katherine returns it is discovered that she had always loved Stefan and not Damon; however, Stefan is in love with Elena and not interested in Katherine. Stefan starts to build a friendship with Caroline Forbes after she is turned into a vampire. After Klaus gives Stefan his blood to save Damon from a werewolf bite, he turns Stefan into a Ripper again.\n\nStefan starts working for him as he agreed to do to save Damon, and hopes it might also protect Elena by making sure Klaus never returns to Mystic Falls, since he believes her to be dead. Klaus later finds out and compels Stefan to kill her, but when he is able to resist the compulsion, Klaus makes him turn his humanity and emotions off. However, he is later able to get his humanity back, which is seen when he saves Klaus's life to protect Damon, but yet he pretends not to care about Elena anymore. He then takes it upon himself to kill Klaus. He steals Klaus's family as retaliation, and uses them as blackmail, when that fails (the witches give Klaus the coffins when he threatens to end the Bennett line), Stefan threatens to drive Elena off Wickery Bridge with vampire blood in her system if Klaus doesn't get his hybrids out of town, Klaus agrees at the last minute. He and Elena get into a fight. In the season three finale, he kisses Elena. In the end, Elena chooses Stefan over Damon, but when Rebekah causes Matt's truck to drive off Wickery Bridge, she is trapped underwater. Stefan barely gets there in time, but Elena makes him save Matt first and she drowns. It is later revealed Dr. Fell gave Elena vampire blood, meaning she died with vampire blood in her system. Then she became a vampire.\n\n====Season 4====\nIn the season four premiere, Stefan tries to get Bonnie to save her from becoming a full vampire, however, she along with several other vampires are captured by the Founder's Council. As Elena begins to die and out of desperation to keep Elena alive, Stefan kills a guard and uses his blood to allow Elena to feed and to complete her transition into a vampire. Stefan gives Elena a daylight ring, which was made by Bonnie, in order to protect Elena from the sun. Stefan tries to assure Elena that everything will be okay and that they'll take Elena's newborn vampirism one day at a time. During the second episode of season 4, Stefan tries to help Elena cope with her hunger for human blood. After his \"bunny diet\" disagrees with Elena stomach she seeks help from Damon to find an alternative blood source. When blood bags and Damon's own blood fails too, she ends up feeding on Matt under extreme circumstances. Stefan then discovers from Klaus and Rebekah that there is a possible cure for vampirism. Stefan \"teams\" up with Klaus in order to find the possible cure, so that Stefan can give Elena the choice of becoming human again.\n\nUnfortunately, Klaus needs the vampire hunter Connor to stay alive because he holds the map to the cure in his tattoo, and Stefan must keep him alive at all costs when everyone else wants him dead. When Connor kidnaps Jeremy, April, and Matt, and keeps them hostage at the Grill, Stefan must stop Damon from rashly walking in and killing his chance at curing Elena. After tranquilizing Damon with vervain and taking his daylight ring, Stefan tries to take matters into his own hands and infiltrates the Grille by himself. With Jeremy at gunpoint, Elena comes in and takes Connor by surprise. Stefan manages to get Connor out, but Elena later kills him and is consumed with grief at being a murderer.\n\nWhen Elena begins to hallucinate because of Connor's death, Klaus informs Stefan and Damon that she must be locked away to keep from killing herself, and kidnaps her before they can say no. Later, Stefan works with one of Klaus's hybrids, Chris, to free Elena who stabs him in the neck and runs away. Stefan sends Damon to find her and goes with Bonnie to see if the Professor Shane knows how to end the hallucinations. He informs them that a potential hunter must kill a vampire so he may take the place of that dead hunter, which is virtually impossible. Luckily, Stefan realizes that Jeremy is a potential hunter, and tells him that to save his sister, he must kill a vampire. Jeremy kills the hybrid Chris who originally helped them free Elena, and in turn her hallucinations end, and she is safe, but only barely.\n\nLater then, Stefan breaks up with Elena because of her feelings for Damon. Stefan goes to Caroline for support since she loathes Damon, and they become closer. During the Miss Mystic Falls Pageant, Stefan Turns a criminal in the hospital and convinces Jeremy to kill him to make the hunter's mark on his arm grow. Afterward, Jeremy becomes anti-vampire and attempts to kill Elena. Stefan is there and saves her, but has to apologize for making him crazy. Elena tries to tell him that she doesn't need the cure if it means it hurts Jeremy.\n\nThat night Elena comes to stay at the Salvatore house, and Stefan leaves to crash at Caroline's. While there, he and Caroline realize that Elena is sired to Damon. When Stefan informs Damon of this, they go to New Orleans to find the witch that broke a sire bond years ago that Damon had. Stefan and Damon find that in order to break the bond, Damon has to convince Elena not to care about him, and leave her, which Damon agrees to do for Stefan. Post Jeremy's death, Damon convinces Elena to switch off her humanity leading to her becoming brutal and ruthless. Stefan and Damon try constantly to make her feel something again. Later after Elena's humanity comes back, she chooses Damon, leaving Stefan heartbroken. Then Stefan tries to dump Silas body in the river only to find that Silas is still alive. Silas then reveals that Stefan is his doppelganger. Silas was the one who created the immortality spell 2000 years ago however, as nature creates a balance for everything, it created a version of Silas that could be killed, a shadow-self which ends up being Stefan. Silas then locks Stefan into a vault and drowns him in the river. This incident tempts Stefan to turn his humanity off in order to escape.\nStefan happens to be in the safe for 3 months where he keeps on hallucinating.\n\n====Season 5====\nIn season 5, Damon and Elena manage to figure out that Silas has taken Stefan's place and that Stefan is in that safe. When they go to rescue him, Stefan isn't there. Instead, a very powerful witch (Qyetsiyah) had opened the safe for him and fried his brain due to which he suffers from amnesia. Qyetsiyah (or Tessa) loved Silas but on the day of their marriage, he cheated on her and took the immortality spell for the women he actually loved, Amara, the original doppelg\u00e4nger of Elena. Stefan returns to his old ways but when he saves Elena from Tessa, she wants revenge so he gives Stefan his memories back which gives Stefan Hallucinations of the safe. Caroline tries to help him but when that doesn't work, Katherine comes back in the picture and manages to cure Stefan but they have a one-night stand, which leads Katherine to believe that Stefan still loves her, however he rejects her. Later on, Katherine takes over Elena's body and breaks up with Damon so that she can get Stefan. After trying to woo him and failing, Stefan realises that Katherine is pretending to be Elena and Elena is with Nadia, Katherine's daughter. They rescue her somehow by killing Katherine and sending her to some sort of hell. Then Stefan volunteers himself to the travellers to give his blood as they needed doppelganger blood. Caroline and Enzo try to find and kill Tom Avery, Stefan's last doppelganger in order to save Stefan and they succeed due to which Stefan and Caroline grow even closer. Near the end of the season, Stefan and Elena keep seeing dreams of the two being together and of them as humans. They work out that the travellers planted those dreams there as it was always meant to be Stefan and Elena not Damon and Elena. Through the fight, Stefan and Elena are kidnapped by the travellers as they need their blood to finish their spell. However, Enzo and Caroline save them by killing Tom Avery, Stefan's doppelg\u00e4nger. In 5x21, Stefan tries to save Caroline's life from Tyler (while a passenger, Julian, is in his body), during which Tyler kills him, sending him to the disintegrating Other Side. In the episode 'Home' he is Resseructed because Liv did a spell due to which he and his other friends can get back but Damon and Bonnie are left there leaving everyone broken.\n\n====Season 6====\nIn season 6, Stefan moves away from Mystic Falls because of Damon's death and finds a new girlfriend called Ivy. However, Enzo and Caroline, find him and Caroline tells Stefan that he's a coward and the worst friend ever. She starts crying so Enzo goes and kills Ivy. Stefan vows revenge. He comes back to Whitmore, and uses Elena's help to find Enzo leaving him to be killed by a vampire hunter. However, Enzo survives. Ivy returns as a vampire and it is revealed that Enzo had fed her vampire blood against her will before killing her. Damon, then returns to Mystic Falls and meets Stefan first which brings Stefan back to his friends. To make things worse, Enzo tells the other vampire hunter about Ivy and all the other vampires and the vampire hunter kills Ivy but is killed by Damon before the vampire hunter would kill anyone else. Enzo, figures out that Stefan's niece, Sarah is alive and that Damon had thought that he had killed Sarah before she was born but Sarah was born before her mother died however, Stefan kept this from Damon and Enzo uses this against Stefan. Meanwhile, the vampires have another threat, a psycho killer, Kai. Added on top of that, Sheriff Liz Forbes (Caroline's mother) is diagnosed with cancer. Stefan supports Caroline through this in which they bond even more and share a passionate kiss however just then Liz dies. At the funeral, Stefan realises that he has fallen in love with Caroline but before he can confess, Caroline switches off her humanity switch after the funeral. Stefan and Elena try to bring Caroline back but it fails and Caroline vows revenge for them not giving her the year she wanted without any feelings. She kidnaps Stefan and Damon's niece, Sarah Salvatore, and blackmails Stefan to turn off his humanity to save her. At the end of the episode 'The Downward Spiral', he does and joins Caroline.\nStefan decides to ruin Caroline's life because she has done the same to him. He wants her to lose control and become a Ripper. He eventually is able to and they sleep together for the first time.\nWhen Lily, Stefan and Damon's mother, is rescued from the 1903 prison world and turns out to be a vampire, she manages to turn on Stefan's humanity again. However, it later is revealed that Lily lied to get him back and doesn't love her sons any more and only wants her travelling companions back.

When I'm in my lustful state, it's so much fun. I felt like I got to play a role that I'd never played before. I felt like I was doing something different.

He said \"Good Stefan doesn't feel as natural in terms of what I want to be doing on screen, and what I want to be saying.

Stefan is the younger brother of Damon. When Stefan and Damon were human, they were very close and were best friends in life. Damon always confided and trusted in Stefan and they always defended each other, especially to their father, and was fiercely loyal to him. However, this all seemed to change when Stefan and Damon fell in love with the same girl, Katherine Pierce, who turned out to be a vampire. Stefan fell deeply in love with Katherine before finding out she was a vampire. Katherine, however, compelled Stefan to not be afraid, also to keep her secret and go on as they were. It was also revealed that Katherine compelled Stefan to drink her vampire blood against his will. Damon, on the other hand, drank Katherine's blood willingly, wanting and desiring the immortal life in order to spend an eternity with Katherine. In 1864, Stefan was turned into a vampire after being shot by his father, Giuseppe, along with his brother, Damon with Katherine's blood in his system, before accidentally killing his father during a visit to tell him that he was going to let himself die. Damon, who turned into a vampire as well, promised Stefan an eternity of misery as he was angry that Stefan had forced him to turn and jealous that Katherine had also turned Stefan. A newborn vampire with uncontrollable blood lust, Stefan was unable to resist the temptations of human blood and became severely out of control and addicted (later on known as the Ripper) to the blood, killing many people because of his lack of control and extreme bloodlust. However, Stefan learned to change his ways when he was taught to control it by a vampire named Alexia \"Lexi\" Branson, who later on became Stefan's best friend and companion. In 1942, Stefan enlisted in the Army to fight in [[World War II]] (4x08 \"We'll Always Have Bourbon Street\"). After decades of absence from the town he called home, Stefan returned to Mystic Falls to visit his home and Zach. On May 23, 2009, Stefan heard the Gilbert's car accident at Wickery Bridge. It was then and there that Stefan fatefully encountered Elena Gilbert for the first time. After only being able to save Elena, Stefan noticed that she looked exactly like Katherine.\n\n===Storyline===\n\n====Season 1-3====\nStefan and Elena begin a relationship and he revealed to her that he is a vampire. However, Damon returns to Mystic Falls, too, and also falls in love with Elena. Further on in the series, Damon and Stefan start to bond as brothers again and it becomes apparent that they do love each other. Because of his addiction to human blood, Stefan only drank animal blood in the beginning of the series, which made him weaker than other vampires. In season two, Stefan starts to take small amounts of Elena's blood each day to mitigate its effect on him and to increase his strength. When Katherine returns it is discovered that she had always loved Stefan and not Damon; however, Stefan is in love with Elena and not interested in Katherine. Stefan starts to build a friendship with Caroline Forbes after she is turned into a vampire. After Klaus gives Stefan his blood to save Damon from a werewolf bite, he turns Stefan into a Ripper again.\n\nStefan starts working for him as he agreed to do to save Damon, and hopes it might also protect Elena by making sure Klaus never returns to Mystic Falls, since he believes her to be dead. Klaus later finds out and compels Stefan to kill her, but when he is able to resist the compulsion, Klaus makes him turn his humanity and emotions off. However, he is later able to get his humanity back, which is seen when he saves Klaus's life to protect Damon, but yet he pretends not to care about Elena anymore. He then takes it upon himself to kill Klaus. He steals Klaus's family as retaliation, and uses them as blackmail, when that fails (the witches give Klaus the coffins when he threatens to end the Bennett line), Stefan threatens to drive Elena off Wickery Bridge with vampire blood in her system if Klaus doesn't get his hybrids out of town, Klaus agrees at the last minute. He and Elena get into a fight. In the season three finale, he kisses Elena. In the end, Elena chooses Stefan over Damon, but when Rebekah causes Matt's truck to drive off Wickery Bridge, she is trapped underwater. Stefan barely gets there in time, but Elena makes him save Matt first and she drowns. It is later revealed Dr. Fell gave Elena vampire blood, meaning she died with vampire blood in her system. Then she became a vampire.\n\n====Season 4====\nIn the season four premiere, Stefan tries to get Bonnie to save her from becoming a full vampire, however, she along with several other vampires are captured by the Founder's Council. As Elena begins to die and out of desperation to keep Elena alive, Stefan kills a guard and uses his blood to allow Elena to feed and to complete her transition into a vampire. Stefan gives Elena a daylight ring, which was made by Bonnie, in order to protect Elena from the sun. Stefan tries to assure Elena that everything will be okay and that they'll take Elena's newborn vampirism one day at a time. During the second episode of season 4, Stefan tries to help Elena cope with her hunger for human blood. After his \"bunny diet\" disagrees with Elena stomach she seeks help from Damon to find an alternative blood source. When blood bags and Damon's own blood fails too, she ends up feeding on Matt under extreme circumstances. Stefan then discovers from Klaus and Rebekah that there is a possible cure for vampirism. Stefan \"teams\" up with Klaus in order to find the possible cure, so that Stefan can give Elena the choice of becoming human again.\n\nUnfortunately, Klaus needs the vampire hunter Connor to stay alive because he holds the map to the cure in his tattoo, and Stefan must keep him alive at all costs when everyone else wants him dead. When Connor kidnaps Jeremy, April, and Matt, and keeps them hostage at the Grill, Stefan must stop Damon from rashly walking in and killing his chance at curing Elena. After tranquilizing Damon with vervain and taking his daylight ring, Stefan tries to take matters into his own hands and infiltrates the Grille by himself. With Jeremy at gunpoint, Elena comes in and takes Connor by surprise. Stefan manages to get Connor out, but Elena later kills him and is consumed with grief at being a murderer.\n\nWhen Elena begins to hallucinate because of Connor's death, Klaus informs Stefan and Damon that she must be locked away to keep from killing herself, and kidnaps her before they can say no. Later, Stefan works with one of Klaus's hybrids, Chris, to free Elena who stabs him in the neck and runs away. Stefan sends Damon to find her and goes with Bonnie to see if the Professor Shane knows how to end the hallucinations. He informs them that a potential hunter must kill a vampire so he may take the place of that dead hunter, which is virtually impossible. Luckily, Stefan realizes that Jeremy is a potential hunter, and tells him that to save his sister, he must kill a vampire. Jeremy kills the hybrid Chris who originally helped them free Elena, and in turn her hallucinations end, and she is safe, but only barely.\n\nLater then, Stefan breaks up with Elena because of her feelings for Damon. Stefan goes to Caroline for support since she loathes Damon, and they become closer. During the Miss Mystic Falls Pageant, Stefan Turns a criminal in the hospital and convinces Jeremy to kill him to make the hunter's mark on his arm grow. Afterward, Jeremy becomes anti-vampire and attempts to kill Elena. Stefan is there and saves her, but has to apologize for making him crazy. Elena tries to tell him that she doesn't need the cure if it means it hurts Jeremy.\n\nThat night Elena comes to stay at the Salvatore house, and Stefan leaves to crash at Caroline's. While there, he and Caroline realize that Elena is sired to Damon. When Stefan informs Damon of this, they go to New Orleans to find the witch that broke a sire bond years ago that Damon had. Stefan and Damon find that in order to break the bond, Damon has to convince Elena not to care about him, and leave her, which Damon agrees to do for Stefan. Post Jeremy's death, Damon convinces Elena to switch off her humanity leading to her becoming brutal and ruthless. Stefan and Damon try constantly to make her feel something again. Later after Elena's humanity comes back, she chooses Damon, leaving Stefan heartbroken. Then Stefan tries to dump Silas body in the river only to find that Silas is still alive. Silas then reveals that Stefan is his doppelganger. Silas was the one who created the immortality spell 2000 years ago however, as nature creates a balance for everything, it created a version of Silas that could be killed, a shadow-self which ends up being Stefan. Silas then locks Stefan into a vault and drowns him in the river. This incident tempts Stefan to turn his humanity off in order to escape.\nStefan happens to be in the safe for 3 months where he keeps on hallucinating.\n\n====Season 5====\nIn season 5, Damon and Elena manage to figure out that Silas has taken Stefan's place and that Stefan is in that safe. When they go to rescue him, Stefan isn't there. Instead, a very powerful witch (Qyetsiyah) had opened the safe for him and fried his brain due to which he suffers from amnesia. Qyetsiyah (or Tessa) loved Silas but on the day of their marriage, he cheated on her and took the immortality spell for the women he actually loved, Amara, the original doppelg\u00e4nger of Elena. Stefan returns to his old ways but when he saves Elena from Tessa, she wants revenge so he gives Stefan his memories back which gives Stefan Hallucinations of the safe. Caroline tries to help him but when that doesn't work, Katherine comes back in the picture and manages to cure Stefan but they have a one-night stand, which leads Katherine to believe that Stefan still loves her, however he rejects her. Later on, Katherine takes over Elena's body and breaks up with Damon so that she can get Stefan. After trying to woo him and failing, Stefan realises that Katherine is pretending to be Elena and Elena is with Nadia, Katherine's daughter. They rescue her somehow by killing Katherine and sending her to some sort of hell. Then Stefan volunteers himself to the travellers to give his blood as they needed doppelganger blood. Caroline and Enzo try to find and kill Tom Avery, Stefan's last doppelganger in order to save Stefan and they succeed due to which Stefan and Caroline grow even closer. Near the end of the season, Stefan and Elena keep seeing dreams of the two being together and of them as humans. They work out that the travellers planted those dreams there as it was always meant to be Stefan and Elena not Damon and Elena. Through the fight, Stefan and Elena are kidnapped by the travellers as they need their blood to finish their spell. However, Enzo and Caroline save them by killing Tom Avery, Stefan's doppelg\u00e4nger. In 5x21, Stefan tries to save Caroline's life from Tyler (while a passenger, Julian, is in his body), during which Tyler kills him, sending him to the disintegrating Other Side. In the episode 'Home' he is Resseructed because Liv did a spell due to which he and his other friends can get back but Damon and Bonnie are left there leaving everyone broken.\n\n====Season 6====\nIn season 6, Stefan moves away from Mystic Falls because of Damon's death and finds a new girlfriend called Ivy. However, Enzo and Caroline, find him and Caroline tells Stefan that he's a coward and the worst friend ever. She starts crying so Enzo goes and kills Ivy. Stefan vows revenge. He comes back to Whitmore, and uses Elena's help to find Enzo leaving him to be killed by a vampire hunter. However, Enzo survives. Ivy returns as a vampire and it is revealed that Enzo had fed her vampire blood against her will before killing her. Damon, then returns to Mystic Falls and meets Stefan first which brings Stefan back to his friends. To make things worse, Enzo tells the other vampire hunter about Ivy and all the other vampires and the vampire hunter kills Ivy but is killed by Damon before the vampire hunter would kill anyone else. Enzo, figures out that Stefan's niece, Sarah is alive and that Damon had thought that he had killed Sarah before she was born but Sarah was born before her mother died however, Stefan kept this from Damon and Enzo uses this against Stefan. Meanwhile, the vampires have another threat, a psycho killer, Kai. Added on top of that, Sheriff Liz Forbes (Caroline's mother) is diagnosed with cancer. Stefan supports Caroline through this in which they bond even more and share a passionate kiss however just then Liz dies. At the funeral, Stefan realises that he has fallen in love with Caroline but before he can confess, Caroline switches off her humanity switch after the funeral. Stefan and Elena try to bring Caroline back but it fails and Caroline vows revenge for them not giving her the year she wanted without any feelings. She kidnaps Stefan and Damon's niece, Sarah Salvatore, and blackmails Stefan to turn off his humanity to save her. At the end of the episode 'The Downward Spiral', he does and joins Caroline.\nStefan decides to ruin Caroline's life because she has done the same to him. He wants her to lose control and become a Ripper. He eventually is able to and they sleep together for the first time.\nWhen Lily, Stefan and Damon's mother, is rescued from the 1903 prison world and turns out to be a vampire, she manages to turn on Stefan's humanity again. However, it later is revealed that Lily lied to get him back and doesn't love her sons any more and only wants her travelling companions back. Stefan then pretends to still have his emotions off to get Caroline back and somehow succeeds, but Caroline tries to avoid him as she feels guilty for everything she had done. Stefan then also tries to talk Damon out of being a human again only to be with Elena but Damon decides to take the cure.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{The Vampire Diaries}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Salvatore, Stefan}}\n[[Category:Fictional vampires]]\n[[Category:The Vampire Diaries characters]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1991]]\n[[Category:Characters in American novels of the 20th century]]\n[[Category:Fictional World War II veterans]]\n", "name_user": "188.141.15.36", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Added content)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Salvatore"}

His romantic feelings toward [[Rachel Green]], which began as a high-school infatuation, are an ongoing theme of his narrative arc. Likewise, their on-again, off-again romantic relationship is a nearly constant theme of ''Friends''.\n\nBorn on May 12, 1967 (although in one episode he claims his birthday is in December and in episode 4 of season 1 he says that it is October 20 and his birthday was 7 months ago; in episode 2 of season 9, he states his birthday is October 18), and raised on [[Long Island]], Ross is the elder brother of [[Monica Geller]]. Ross and Monica are [[Jewish]] and see themselves as at least [[cultural Judaism|cultural Jews]], with Ross taking a more active role in wanting to teach his son, Ben, about the faith. Ross gets divorced and is newly single in the very first episode because his wife, Carol, has realized she's a [[lesbian]]. Later in the series, he dates Rachel Green, but their relationship results in a break-up. After his relationship with Rachel ends, Ross gets married to Emily Waltham, the niece of Rachel's boss. However, because Ross says \"I take thee Rachel\" instead of Emily during the nuptials, the marriage doesn't last long. In season 5, Ross marries Rachel in Las Vegas when the two are drunk, and ultimately that marriage results in a divorce as well, but they confess that if they ever got married properly it would be the one that lasted. Throughout the series, Ross gets divorced 3 times. In the first episode of ''Joey'', the spinoff series, it is hinted that Ross and Rachel may have gotten married again, as he tells his sister Gina that all of his friends are married.\n\nA running theme in Ross's narrative is his competition with his younger sister, manifested through wrestling and paranoia. As children, they took part in an American football match for the Geller Cup every [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. This tradition ended in its sixth year, after Monica \"accidentally\" [[Nasal fracture|broke]] Ross's nose. The siblings came up with a dance in primary school called \"The Routine\", which they performed as adults at Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve in a [[New Year's Eve]] TV broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|last=Anonymous|title=Plot Summary for \"Friends\" The One with the Routine (1999)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0583641/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl}}</ref>\n\nWhen they were kids, Monica used to hate Ross because he always got his way and she felt he was loved more than her, as their parents\u2019 first child. However, as time passed and they grew up, she actually liked Ross as a person and loved him more than out of a sense of family obligation. As adults they became close, though the competition between them was still visible as seen in the season three episode, \"The One with the Football\".\n\nRoss often comes into conflict with [[Phoebe Buffay]]. His [[rationality]] and Phoebe's eccentricity lead to conflict over [[evolution]], [[gravity]], and whether Phoebe's mother was [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] as a cat. It is also revealed that Phoebe once mugged Ross (stealing a copy of the comic book ''Science Boy'' that Ross had created) when they were teenagers. The two are roommates for a few weeks when a fire forces Phoebe to move out of her apartment. She first moves into [[Chandler Bing]] and Monica's apartment, but then decides she wants to give the newly engaged couple some privacy, so she moves in with Ross. In a \"flashback\" episode, they are alone at a bar and start kissing, but the moment quickly passes when Ross keeps bumping his head. Phoebe also helps Ross on numerous occasions, ultimately making him realize that he loves Rachel and they both are meant to be together.\n\nSince college, Ross' best friend has been Chandler Bing. In college, they were in a band called ''Way/No Way'', and Ross blamed Chandler when he was caught smoking [[marijuana]]. They become brothers-in-law after Chandler marries Monica. Though they are best friends, at times Chandler gets annoyed with Ross's geeky behavior.\n\nRoss is friends with Rachel Green, whom he has had a crush on since high school. Rachel viewed Ross as \u2018Monica\u2019s geeky older brother\u2019 during high school. During the first episode of the series, when they meet after years apart, he rediscovers his feelings for her. They become close and have an on-and-off romantic relationship through the series. In the final season of the show, Rachel tells him that he means more to her than any other member of their group.\n\nHe is also close friends with [[Joey Tribbiani]] and helps him with acting auditions. He kisses Joey once in order to help him practice a role as a gay man, only to find out that Joey had already done the audition and didn't get the part. Joey and Ross also briefly try to cut Chandler out of their friend group after Chandler ignores them. They once fall asleep together on the couch after watching ''Die Hard''. Toward the end of the series, however, Ross and Joey become closer friends, often hanging out together after Chandler gets married.\n\nRoss often tries to bring out the best of his friends in difficult situations. For instance, in season 2, he encourages Joey to audition for ''Another World'' after being fired from ''Days of Our Lives'' despite Joey's refusal to audition for a two-line part of a secondary character. In season 7, he buys Phoebe the bike of her dreams but threatens to take it away from her because of her reluctance to learn how to ride it. Also, when he discovers that Joey has a crush on Rachel, he tells him to tell her about it and go for it instead of hiding it, even though he finds it difficult to accept the idea of Joey and Rachel being together. Above all, Ross is portrayed as a very sweet, loving and adorable character who is always looking out for everyone's best interests and often the most mature compared to the rest of the gang (despite his ego, outbursts, and paranoia).\n\nHe has two children. Ross's son, Ben, was conceived while Ross and Carol were still married and born at the end of Season 1. Ross shares joint custody of Ben with his ex-wife Carol and her wife Susan.\n\nBen appeared in a total of 24 episodes (25 if you include uncut episodes) and was played chronologically as follows: as an infant by Michael Gunderson Season 1 to 2, by brothers Charles Thomas Allen and John Christopher Allen from Season 3 to 5, and by [[Cole Sprouse]] from Season 6 to 8.\n\nRoss's daughter with Rachel, Emma Geller-Green, was born at the end of Season 8. Rachel's pregnancy was originally revealed in the season finale of Season 7. The conception of Emma was predominantly the result of a [[one-night stand]], which was later revealed in the Season 8 episode, \"The One With The Videotape\".\n\nRoss claims to have \"given up a career in basketball\" to become a paleontologist, and claims that the ideas for ''Jurassic Park'' and ''Die Hard'' were stolen from him. He also had major interest in music, playing keyboard for hours in the basement of their house in Long Island.\n\nRoss had a pet in the earlier seasons of the show: a [[white-headed capuchin]] monkey named Marcel.\n\n==Relationships==\nOver the course of the show, Ross dates a considerable number of women. He married three times and is divorced three times. His proclivity to marry and divorce is a [[running gag]] within the series.\n\n*Julie: An old graduate school colleague, portrayed by [[Lauren Tom]]. She first appears in the final scene of the season 1 finale, returning with Ross from an archeological dig in [[China]]. They start dating in season 2 but break up after Ross discovers Rachel's feelings for him and decides he wants to be with her instead. It is heavily implied that she starts a relationship with Russ, an ex-boyfriend of Rachel's with an uncanny resemblance to Ross.\n*Bonnie: A love interest (played by [[Christine Taylor]]) introduced to Ross by Phoebe, Bonnie is formerly a militant bald woman who no longer shaves her head. She enjoyed a sex-filled relationship with Ross, until a conniving Rachel broke them up by first encouraging Bonnie up to shave her head again, which she knows will bother Ross, and later by revealing she was interested in reuniting with Ross.\n*Mona: A love interest he met at Monica and Chandler's wedding (portrayed by [[Bonnie Somerville]]). Ross becomes paranoid after Mona proposes to send out Christmas cards together, and in a panic decides to give her a key to his apartment. It is later revealed that Mona is unable to say \"I love you\" yet, and delivers what the female friends refer to as \"an emotional slap in the face\" with \"I love spending time with you\". The relationship ends when Mona discovers that Rachel is living in Ross's apartment, after Ross neglects to tell her this himself. When he hides in her apartment to retrieve his shirt while she is on a date with another man, Mona, under the belief that Ross wanted to win her back, admits she still has feelings for him but states that they both need to move on.\n*Chloe: Ross's only relationship with Chloe (referred to in a few prior episodes as \"The cute girl from the copy place with the belly button ring\") was a one-night stand during a \"break\" with his relationship with Rachel, which interferes with their attempt to get back together. Although only covered over two episodes in season 3, Ross' fling with Chloe would be the basis of the \"We were on a break!\" running joke that would last until the very end of the series.\n*[[List of recurring characters in Friends#Janice Goralnik|Janice]]: Ross has a brief fling with Janice, Chandler's ex-girlfriend, in season 5. Phoebe said they would have very hairy children. Janice ironically dumps Ross because he whines too much. Ross, worried about how he would react, tells Chandler, who laughs, but chooses to forgive him.\n*Elizabeth Stevens: A pretty 20-year-old student who Ross teaches during his first year as a professor. The two go through a tremendous amount of effort to keep their relationship a secret from the faculty, as Ross would get fired for dating a student. He even tries to get on good terms with Elizabeth's father Paul ([[Bruce Willis]]), who in turn threatens to report him to the university. Ross eventually manages to blackmail Paul into pretending to like him by threatening to reveal Paul's embarrassing mirror dance routine to Rachel (who dates him briefly). Despite Paul no longer being a threat, Ross eventually realizes he sees no future in his relationship with Elizabeth and decides to break up with her due to her immaturity.\n*Charlie Wheeler: Ross meets Charlie ([[Aisha Tyler]]) in \"The One With The Soap Opera Party\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2016/05/27/david_schwimmer_puts_in_the_work_on_learning_wine_waiting_tables_and_why_he_campaigned_for_years_for_a_black_girlfriend_for_ross_geller/|title=David Schwimmer puts in the work: On learning wine, waiting tables and why he \"campaigned for years for a black girlfriend\" for Ross Geller|author=Sonia Saraiya|work=Salon|accessdate=May 30, 2016}}</ref> She is a paleontologist who has recently joined Ross's department. She initially dates Joey before breaking up with him and gravitating toward Ross, after realizing she has more things in common with Ross. She eventually reconciles with her ex-boyfriend and breaks up with Ross.\n*Cheryl: A very attractive woman that Ross briefly dates. He decides he wants to pursue a relationship with her, but is stifled by her incredibly filthy apartment. Despite her own living quarters being littered with garbage and infested with all kinds of pests, she can't stand the \"weird smell\" of Ross' apartment, which is why she doesn't like being there. After Ross breaks off the relationship after being covered in all kinds of trash in an attempt to make out with Cheryl, Monica later visits her and offers to clean her apartment, revealing she \"couldn't sleep\" after Ross told her about it.\n*Jill Green: Ross very briefly dates Rachel's spoiled younger sister Jill (played by [[Reese Witherspoon]]) after her father sends her to New York to take lessons from Rachel in self-sufficiency. Although Jill actually finds Ross a geek, she dates him out of spite because Rachel is uncomfortable with it and tells her \"she's always wanted what she couldn't have\". Ross, upon realising he is being used, breaks it off with Jill because he does not want to end any possibility there could be of him and Rachel getting back together.\n\n===Rachel Green===\nRachel is Ross's most significant relationship during the series. His attraction to her is established early on; Ross met Rachel through his sister Monica, who was Rachel's best friend in high school. He developed an [[Unrequited love|unrequited crush]] on her, but never followed through on it. After leaving college, Ross married Carol, whom he had met at college, and had seemingly put his feelings for Rachel aside before he met her again in [[The Pilot (Friends)|The Pilot]].\n\nThey have an on-again, off-again dynamic throughout most of the show.\n\nIn the Season 1 finale, Ross has to go to China for his work so he asks Chandler to give Rachel a present on her birthday which he had bought for her. Chandler does give the present to Rachel during her birthday celebration while Ross is in China but also accidentally reveals Ross's feelings for Rachel, prompting Rachel to panic and start thinking about Ross in a romantic way. After Ross arrives back from China, Rachel goes to the airport to receive him on realising that she likes him, but she sees him with [[Julie (Friends)|Julie]] and reluctantly backs off.\n\nIn Season 2 episode [[The One Where Ross Finds Out]], Rachel is on a date with a guy when she confesses to Ross over the phone in a drunken state that she had feelings for him but now she is over him. Ross hears this message the next day at Monica's apartment with Rachel begging him not to check his messages. Later, in the same episode they share a passionate kiss at the doors of Central Perk. Later he breaks up with Julie but Rachel decides she doesn't want to be with him after finding out that he had made a list, on the insistence of Chandler, comparing the good and bad qualities about her and Julie.\n\nThe two begin dating each other only from Episode 15 of Season 2 after in the earlier episode [[The One with the Prom Video]] it is revealed that Ross, despite being two years senior to Rachel, had decided to be her date on her and Monica's prom, as Rachel's date had not arrived, only to be left disappointed as her date arrives and they both along with Monica and her date take off for the prom. Touched by this, Rachel kisses Ross on learning this revelation. However, they take a break from their relationship on their one-year anniversary together. That same night, Ross has a one-night stand with Chloe, which officially ends their relationship. They get together again at the end of Season 3 but again break up at the start of Season 4. Some of the later episodes show them to be still in love with each other such as when Ross cancels his Discovery channel show appearance to be with Rachel when she breaks her rib or when Rachel flies to London to tell Ross before his wedding with Emily, that she's still in love with him, only to realize that it would be better not to tell.\n\nRoss and Rachel also marry each other after getting heavily drunk in Las Vegas. This marriage ends in a divorce after a failed application for an annulment.\n\nIn the 7th-season premiere, after the news of Monica and Chandler's engagement, a passionate moment between them leads to Ross and Rachel kissing. Monica is hurt by this as she believed that Rachel was trying to \u201csteal her thunder\u201d. The kiss is later revealed to have happened because Rachel was upset thinking about the fact that she was \u201cnot even close\u201d to being engaged.\n\nIn beginning of season 8, it is revealed on the day of Monica and Chandler's wedding that Rachel is pregnant, with the father unknown to everyone but her. In the season 8 finale, Ross's daughter with Rachel named Emma Geller-Green is born, as a result of their one night stand prior to Chandler and Monica's wedding.\n\nIn the final episode of the show, when Rachel is moving to Paris for her job with a new fashion brand, Ross tells her at the airport that he loves her and asks not to leave. Rachel initially doesn't heed his feelings, but when the plane is about to take off, she realizes that she loves him too and gets off the plane. They profess their love for each other and decide to be together once and for all. \n\nIn the pilot episode of the spin-off/sequel series ''[[Joey (TV series)|Joey]]'', it is mentioned that Ross and Rachel eventually re-married. In the fifteenth episode, Ross is mentioned, though not by name, in discussion when Joey tells his sister Gina that he confessed his love to Rachel but she was pregnant with Ross's baby and eventually ended up with him, the reason why Joey becomes reluctant to confess the same feelings to his girlfriend, Sarah.\n\n===Carol Willick===\nCarol ([[Anita Barone]] for pilot episode, [[Jane Sibbett]] thereafter) is Ross's first wife and the mother of his son Ben. In the very first episode, Carol has just moved out of their apartment after coming out of the closet as a [[lesbian]] and leaving Ross for a woman named Susan Bunch, whom she later marries.\n\nIn the early days, however, Ross and Carol seemed to have had a very passionate relationship. Carol is the only woman he's ever had sex with (and hence lost his virginity to) at the start of the series. It is also revealed they shared a steamy session at [[Disneyland]] behind the \"Dutch children\" in [[It's a Small World]], which got them a lifetime ban from the theme park. In the third season episode, \"The One with the Flashback\", it is revealed that Carol met Susan at her gym, and it is implied that they had a short affair before Carol could no longer bring herself to cheat on Ross, who innocently believed they were just friends, and told him the truth.\n\nRoss maintains a fairly healthy relationship with Carol after their divorce and both decide to raise Ben together through [[shared parenting]], but he doesn't hide his contempt for Susan as he believes she destroyed their marriage and since she initially wanted to keep him out of Ben's life, having once told him to his face that the baby was not his and would not have the surname \"Geller\". He briefly considers getting back together with Carol and they even share a kiss at a sushi restaurant, but Carol makes it clear that she can't reciprocate his feelings and has chosen to be with Susan. In the second season, when Carol and Susan briefly call off their wedding due to Carol's homophobic parents' refusal to bless their relationship, Ross gives Carol away at the wedding and shares a dance with Susan, who develops a newfound respect for him.\n\nCarol's lack of romantic feelings towards Ross is reinforced in the alternate timeline episode \"The One that Could have Been\" (season 6). Exploring what could have happened if Ross and Carol never got divorced, it is revealed that they have been on a sexual dry spell that has lasted for months. Carol is very excited when Ross proposes they have a threesome with another woman. Picking Susan, whom she met at her gym just like in the real timeline, the two girls end up mostly having sex without Ross. He explains to Joey that he felt like a third wheel and ended up being so bored he made himself a sandwich. Ross realizes his wife is a lesbian when Rachel's \"could have been\" character states outright that Carol \"sounds gay.\"\n\n===Emily Waltham===\nDuring the [[Friends (season 4)|fourth season]], Ross meets and falls in love with Emily Waltham ([[Helen Baxendale]]), a British woman who is set up with Ross by Rachel. Six weeks into their relationship, Ross spontaneously asks Emily to move in with him. This escalates into a marriage proposal. The two plan a wedding in [[London]], to which [[Rachel Green|Rachel]] is invited.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Ross, upon seeing Rachel, has a slip of the tongue and says Rachel's name instead of Emily's during his vows. Emily is furious and exits her own wedding. Later, however, she decides to forgive Ross, and reaches the airport in time to leave for their honeymoon, but is upset when she sees Ross and Rachel boarding the plane together after Ross, having given up on meeting Emily at the airport, invites Rachel on their honeymoon as friend. She flees again, and Ross unsuccessfully tries to follow her, and Rachel ends up going on the honeymoon alone. Emily, later, calls Ross only to confront him by saying that he has to stop calling and harassing her relatives, but Ross makes her reveal her love for him. She said that she will return only if Ross stops being friends with Rachel. Unable to do so, Ross ends his marriage with Emily.\n\nShortly before Emily gets remarried to an anonymous man (although it might be assumed it is former lover Colin, whom she previously dumped to be with Ross), she gets cold feet and calls Ross to ask if their divorce was a mistake. While Ross is on a police ride-a-long with Phoebe's cop boyfriend Gary, Rachel hears and accidentally deletes Emily's message on the answering machine. Despite Monica pleading to keep Ross in the dark about it, Rachel tells him that Emily called, as she believes he should be in charge of his own happiness. When he starts to doubt whether or not he should return Emily's call, however, Rachel is quick to convince him not to. From this point onwards, Emily is never seen in the show again.\n\n== Reception ==\nRoss Geller has become a well-known figure in pop culture, in particular due to his relationship with Rachel Green, his neurotic nature, and his love for dinosaurs.\n\nIn 2015, a play titled ''Ross & Rachel'' debuted at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.assemblyfestival.com/event/125/|title=Ross & Rachel \u2013 Assembly Festival \u2013 Edinburgh Fringe|website=www.assemblyfestival.com|access-date=May 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2016, Ross Geller was voted \"the Best Friends Character\" in an international poll held by [[Comedy Central]], during six weeks of ''\"FriendsFest\"'' on the channel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.co.uk/friends/articles/our-favourite-ever-ross-moments|title=It's Official: Ross Geller Is The Best Friend|website=[[Comedy Central]]|accessdate=July 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of Friends characters|List of ''Friends'' characters]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Friends}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Geller, Ross}}\n[[Category:Friends (1994 TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional professors]]\n[[Category:Fictional paleontologists]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Fictional American Jews]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1994]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Fictional TV character}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2019}}\n{{in-universe|date=July 2015}}\n{{Infobox character\n| image              = David Schwimmer as Ross Geller.jpg\n| name               = Ross Geller\n| series             = [[Friends]]\n| first              = \"[[The Pilot (Friends)|The Pilot]]\" (1994)\n| last               = \"[[The Last One (Friends)|The Last One]]\" (2004)\n| occupation         = [[Paleontologist]]<br/>[[College professor]]\n| title              = [[Doctor of Philosophy|Doctor]]<br/>[[Professor]]\n| portrayer          = [[David Schwimmer]]\n| religion           = [[Irreligion|Non-religious]] ([[Cultural Judaism]])<ref>https://www.vulture.com/2014/12/friends-countdown-is-rachel-green-jewish.html</ref>\n| creator            = [[David Crane (producer)|David Crane]]<br />[[Marta Kauffman]]\n| spouse             = [[List of Friends characters#Carol Willick and Susan Bunch|Carol Willick]] (ex-wife)<br />[[List of Friends characters#Emily Waltham-Geller|Emily Waltham]] (ex-wife)<br /> [[Rachel Green]] (m. 1999)\n| family             = [[Jack Geller]] (father)<br />[[Judy Geller]] (mother)<br />[[Monica Geller]] (sister)<br/> Althea (maternal grandmother)\n| children           = [[Ben Geller]] (son)<br />[[List of Friends characters|Emma Geller-Green]] (daughter)\n| relatives          = [[Chandler Bing]] (brother-in-law)<br/>[[Jack Bing]] (nephew)<br/>[[Erica Bing]] (niece)Sylvia Geller (paternal aunt) <br/> Iris Geller (paternal aunt) <br/> Millie Geller (paternal aunt) <br/>  Cassie Geller (cousin) <br/> Nathan (cousin) <br/> Phyllis (maternal aunt) <br/> Lillian (maternal aunt) <br/> Cheryl (aunt) <br/> Freddie (uncle) <br/> Lisa (aunt) <br/> Marilyn (aunt) <br/> Dan (uncle) <br/> Murray (uncle) <br/> Ed (uncle)\n| gender             = Male\n}}\n\n'''Ross Eustace Geller''', [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], is one of the [[List of Friends characters|six main fictional characters]] of the [[NBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Friends]]'' portrayed by [[David Schwimmer]].

His romantic feelings toward [[Rachel Green]], which began as a high-school infatuation, are an ongoing theme of his narrative arc. Likewise, their on-again, off-again romantic relationship is a nearly constant theme of ''Friends''.\n\nBorn on May 12, 1967 (although in one episode he claims his birthday is in December and in episode 4 of season 1 he says that it is October 20 and his birthday was 7 months ago; in episode 2 of season 9, he states his birthday is October 18), and raised on [[Long Island]], Ross is the elder brother of [[Monica Geller]]. Ross and Monica are [[Jewish]] and see themselves as at least [[cultural Judaism|cultural Jews]], with Ross taking a more active role in wanting to teach his son, Ben, about the faith. Ross gets divorced and is newly single in the very first episode because his wife, Carol, has realized she's a [[lesbian]]. Later in the series, he dates Rachel Green, but their relationship results in a break-up. After his relationship with Rachel ends, Ross gets married to Emily Waltham, the niece of Rachel's boss. However, because Ross says \"I take thee Rachel\" instead of Emily during the nuptials, the marriage doesn't last long. In season 5, Ross marries Rachel in Las Vegas when the two are drunk, and ultimately that marriage results in a divorce as well, but they confess that if they ever got married properly it would be the one that lasted. Throughout the series, Ross gets divorced 3 times. In the first episode of ''Joey'', the spinoff series, it is hinted that Ross and Rachel may have gotten married again, as he tells his sister Gina that all of his friends are married.\n\nA running theme in Ross's narrative is his competition with his younger sister, manifested through wrestling and paranoia. As children, they took part in an American football match for the Geller Cup every [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. This tradition ended in its sixth year, after Monica \"accidentally\" [[Nasal fracture|broke]] Ross's nose. The siblings came up with a dance in primary school called \"The Routine\", which they performed as adults at Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve in a [[New Year's Eve]] TV broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|last=Anonymous|title=Plot Summary for \"Friends\" The One with the Routine (1999)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0583641/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl}}</ref>\n\nWhen they were kids, Monica used to hate Ross because he always got his way and she felt he was loved more than her, as their parents\u2019 first child. However, as time passed and they grew up, she actually liked Ross as a person and loved him more than out of a sense of family obligation. As adults they became close, though the competition between them was still visible as seen in the season three episode, \"The One with the Football\".\n\nRoss often comes into conflict with [[Phoebe Buffay]]. His [[rationality]] and Phoebe's eccentricity lead to conflict over [[evolution]], [[gravity]], and whether Phoebe's mother was [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] as a cat. It is also revealed that Phoebe once mugged Ross (stealing a copy of the comic book ''Science Boy'' that Ross had created) when they were teenagers. The two are roommates for a few weeks when a fire forces Phoebe to move out of her apartment. She first moves into [[Chandler Bing]] and Monica's apartment, but then decides she wants to give the newly engaged couple some privacy, so she moves in with Ross. In a \"flashback\" episode, they are alone at a bar and start kissing, but the moment quickly passes when Ross keeps bumping his head. Phoebe also helps Ross on numerous occasions, ultimately making him realize that he loves Rachel and they both are meant to be together.\n\nSince college, Ross' best friend has been Chandler Bing. In college, they were in a band called ''Way/No Way'', and Ross blamed Chandler when he was caught smoking [[marijuana]]. They become brothers-in-law after Chandler marries Monica. Though they are best friends, at times Chandler gets annoyed with Ross's geeky behavior.\n\nRoss is friends with Rachel Green, whom he has had a crush on since high school. Rachel viewed Ross as \u2018Monica\u2019s geeky older brother\u2019 during high school. During the first episode of the series, when they meet after years apart, he rediscovers his feelings for her. They become close and have an on-and-off romantic relationship through the series. In the final season of the show, Rachel tells him that he means more to her than any other member of their group.\n\nHe is also close friends with [[Joey Tribbiani]] and helps him with acting auditions. He kisses Joey once in order to help him practice a role as a gay man, only to find out that Joey had already done the audition and didn't get the part. Joey and Ross also briefly try to cut Chandler out of their friend group after Chandler ignores them. They once fall asleep together on the couch after watching ''Die Hard''. Toward the end of the series, however, Ross and Joey become closer friends, often hanging out together after Chandler gets married.\n\nRoss often tries to bring out the best of his friends in difficult situations. For instance, in season 2, he encourages Joey to audition for ''Another World'' after being fired from ''Days of Our Lives'' despite Joey's refusal to audition for a two-line part of a secondary character. In season 7, he buys Phoebe the bike of her dreams but threatens to take it away from her because of her reluctance to learn how to ride it. Also, when he discovers that Joey has a crush on Rachel, he tells him to tell her about it and go for it instead of hiding it, even though he finds it difficult to accept the idea of Joey and Rachel being together. Above all, Ross is portrayed as a very sweet, loving and adorable character who is always looking out for everyone's best interests and often the most mature compared to the rest of the gang (despite his ego, outbursts, and paranoia).\n\nHe has two children. Ross's son, Ben, was conceived while Ross and Carol were still married and born at the end of Season 1. Ross shares joint custody of Ben with his ex-wife Carol and her wife Susan.\n\nBen appeared in a total of 24 episodes (25 if you include uncut episodes) and was played chronologically as follows: as an infant by Michael Gunderson Season 1 to 2, by brothers Charles Thomas Allen and John Christopher Allen from Season 3 to 5, and by [[Cole Sprouse]] from Season 6 to 8.\n\nRoss's daughter with Rachel, Emma Geller-Green, was born at the end of Season 8. Rachel's pregnancy was originally revealed in the season finale of Season 7. The conception of Emma was predominantly the result of a [[one-night stand]], which was later revealed in the Season 8 episode, \"The One With The Videotape\".\n\nRoss claims to have \"given up a career in basketball\" to become a paleontologist, and claims that the ideas for ''Jurassic Park'' and ''Die Hard'' were stolen from him. He also had major interest in music, playing keyboard for hours in the basement of their house in Long Island.\n\nRoss had a pet in the earlier seasons of the show: a [[white-headed capuchin]] monkey named Marcel.\n\n==Relationships==\nOver the course of the show, Ross dates a considerable number of women. He married three times and is divorced three times. His proclivity to marry and divorce is a [[running gag]] within the series.\n\n*Julie: An old graduate school colleague, portrayed by [[Lauren Tom]]. She first appears in the final scene of the season 1 finale, returning with Ross from an archeological dig in [[China]]. They start dating in season 2 but break up after Ross discovers Rachel's feelings for him and decides he wants to be with her instead. It is heavily implied that she starts a relationship with Russ, an ex-boyfriend of Rachel's with an uncanny resemblance to Ross.\n*Bonnie: A love interest (played by [[Christine Taylor]]) introduced to Ross by Phoebe, Bonnie is formerly a militant bald woman who no longer shaves her head. She enjoyed a sex-filled relationship with Ross, until a conniving Rachel broke them up by first encouraging Bonnie up to shave her head again, which she knows will bother Ross, and later by revealing she was interested in reuniting with Ross.\n*Mona: A love interest he met at Monica and Chandler's wedding (portrayed by [[Bonnie Somerville]]). Ross becomes paranoid after Mona proposes to send out Christmas cards together, and in a panic decides to give her a key to his apartment. It is later revealed that Mona is unable to say \"I love you\" yet, and delivers what the female friends refer to as \"an emotional slap in the face\" with \"I love spending time with you\". The relationship ends when Mona discovers that Rachel is living in Ross's apartment, after Ross neglects to tell her this himself. When he hides in her apartment to retrieve his shirt while she is on a date with another man, Mona, under the belief that Ross wanted to win her back, admits she still has feelings for him but states that they both need to move on.\n*Chloe: Ross's only relationship with Chloe (referred to in a few prior episodes as \"The cute girl from the copy place with the belly button ring\") was a one-night stand during a \"break\" with his relationship with Rachel, which interferes with their attempt to get back together. Although only covered over two episodes in season 3, Ross' fling with Chloe would be the basis of the \"We were on a break!\" running joke that would last until the very end of the series.\n*[[List of recurring characters in Friends#Janice Goralnik|Janice]]: Ross has a brief fling with Janice, Chandler's ex-girlfriend, in season 5. Phoebe said they would have very hairy children. Janice ironically dumps Ross because he whines too much. Ross, worried about how he would react, tells Chandler, who laughs, but chooses to forgive him.\n*Elizabeth Stevens: A pretty 20-year-old student who Ross teaches during his first year as a professor. The two go through a tremendous amount of effort to keep their relationship a secret from the faculty, as Ross would get fired for dating a student. He even tries to get on good terms with Elizabeth's father Paul ([[Bruce Willis]]), who in turn threatens to report him to the university. Ross eventually manages to blackmail Paul into pretending to like him by threatening to reveal Paul's embarrassing mirror dance routine to Rachel (who dates him briefly). Despite Paul no longer being a threat, Ross eventually realizes he sees no future in his relationship with Elizabeth and decides to break up with her due to her immaturity.\n*Charlie Wheeler: Ross meets Charlie ([[Aisha Tyler]]) in \"The One With The Soap Opera Party\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2016/05/27/david_schwimmer_puts_in_the_work_on_learning_wine_waiting_tables_and_why_he_campaigned_for_years_for_a_black_girlfriend_for_ross_geller/|title=David Schwimmer puts in the work: On learning wine, waiting tables and why he \"campaigned for years for a black girlfriend\" for Ross Geller|author=Sonia Saraiya|work=Salon|accessdate=May 30, 2016}}</ref> She is a paleontologist who has recently joined Ross's department. She initially dates Joey before breaking up with him and gravitating toward Ross, after realizing she has more things in common with Ross. She eventually reconciles with her ex-boyfriend and breaks up with Ross.\n*Cheryl: A very attractive woman that Ross briefly dates. He decides he wants to pursue a relationship with her, but is stifled by her incredibly filthy apartment. Despite her own living quarters being littered with garbage and infested with all kinds of pests, she can't stand the \"weird smell\" of Ross' apartment, which is why she doesn't like being there. After Ross breaks off the relationship after being covered in all kinds of trash in an attempt to make out with Cheryl, Monica later visits her and offers to clean her apartment, revealing she \"couldn't sleep\" after Ross told her about it.\n*Jill Green: Ross very briefly dates Rachel's spoiled younger sister Jill (played by [[Reese Witherspoon]]) after her father sends her to New York to take lessons from Rachel in self-sufficiency. Although Jill actually finds Ross a geek, she dates him out of spite because Rachel is uncomfortable with it and tells her \"she's always wanted what she couldn't have\". Ross, upon realising he is being used, breaks it off with Jill because he does not want to end any possibility there could be of him and Rachel getting back together.\n\n===Rachel Green===\nRachel is Ross's most significant relationship during the series. His attraction to her is established early on; Ross met Rachel through his sister Monica, who was Rachel's best friend in high school. He developed an [[Unrequited love|unrequited crush]] on her, but never followed through on it. After leaving college, Ross married Carol, whom he had met at college, and had seemingly put his feelings for Rachel aside before he met her again in [[The Pilot (Friends)|The Pilot]].\n\nThey have an on-again, off-again dynamic throughout most of the show.\n\nIn the Season 1 finale, Ross has to go to China for his work so he asks Chandler to give Rachel a present on her birthday which he had bought for her. Chandler does give the present to Rachel during her birthday celebration while Ross is in China but also accidentally reveals Ross's feelings for Rachel, prompting Rachel to panic and start thinking about Ross in a romantic way. After Ross arrives back from China, Rachel goes to the airport to receive him on realising that she likes him, but she sees him with [[Julie (Friends)|Julie]] and reluctantly backs off.\n\nIn Season 2 episode [[The One Where Ross Finds Out]], Rachel is on a date with a guy when she confesses to Ross over the phone in a drunken state that she had feelings for him but now she is over him. Ross hears this message the next day at Monica's apartment with Rachel begging him not to check his messages. Later, in the same episode they share a passionate kiss at the doors of Central Perk. Later he breaks up with Julie but Rachel decides she doesn't want to be with him after finding out that he had made a list, on the insistence of Chandler, comparing the good and bad qualities about her and Julie.\n\nThe two begin dating each other only from Episode 15 of Season 2 after in the earlier episode [[The One with the Prom Video]] it is revealed that Ross, despite being two years senior to Rachel, had decided to be her date on her and Monica's prom, as Rachel's date had not arrived, only to be left disappointed as her date arrives and they both along with Monica and her date take off for the prom. Touched by this, Rachel kisses Ross on learning this revelation. However, they take a break from their relationship on their one-year anniversary together. That same night, Ross has a one-night stand with Chloe, which officially ends their relationship. They get together again at the end of Season 3 but again break up at the start of Season 4. Some of the later episodes show them to be still in love with each other such as when Ross cancels his Discovery channel show appearance to be with Rachel when she breaks her rib or when Rachel flies to London to tell Ross before his wedding with Emily, that she's still in love with him, only to realize that it would be better not to tell.\n\nRoss and Rachel also marry each other after getting heavily drunk in Las Vegas. This marriage ends in a divorce after a failed application for an annulment.\n\nIn the 7th-season premiere, after the news of Monica and Chandler's engagement, a passionate moment between them leads to Ross and Rachel kissing. Monica is hurt by this as she believed that Rachel was trying to \u201csteal her thunder\u201d. The kiss is later revealed to have happened because Rachel was upset thinking about the fact that she was \u201cnot even close\u201d to being engaged.\n\nIn beginning of season 8, it is revealed on the day of Monica and Chandler's wedding that Rachel is pregnant, with the father unknown to everyone but her. In the season 8 finale, Ross's daughter with Rachel named Emma Geller-Green is born, as a result of their one night stand prior to Chandler and Monica's wedding.\n\nIn the final episode of the show, when Rachel is moving to Paris for her job with a new fashion brand, Ross tells her at the airport that he loves her and asks not to leave. Rachel initially doesn't heed his feelings, but when the plane is about to take off, she realizes that she loves him too and gets off the plane. They profess their love for each other and decide to be together once and for all. \n\nIn the pilot episode of the spin-off/sequel series ''[[Joey (TV series)|Joey]]'', it is mentioned that Ross and Rachel eventually re-married. In the fifteenth episode, Ross is mentioned, though not by name, in discussion when Joey tells his sister Gina that he confessed his love to Rachel but she was pregnant with Ross's baby and eventually ended up with him, the reason why Joey becomes reluctant to confess the same feelings to his girlfriend, Sarah.\n\n===Carol Willick===\nCarol ([[Anita Barone]] for pilot episode, [[Jane Sibbett]] thereafter) is Ross's first wife and the mother of his son Ben. In the very first episode, Carol has just moved out of their apartment after coming out of the closet as a [[lesbian]] and leaving Ross for a woman named Susan Bunch, whom she later marries.\n\nIn the early days, however, Ross and Carol seemed to have had a very passionate relationship. Carol is the only woman he's ever had sex with (and hence lost his virginity to) at the start of the series. It is also revealed they shared a steamy session at [[Disneyland]] behind the \"Dutch children\" in [[It's a Small World]], which got them a lifetime ban from the theme park. In the third season episode, \"The One with the Flashback\", it is revealed that Carol met Susan at her gym, and it is implied that they had a short affair before Carol could no longer bring herself to cheat on Ross, who innocently believed they were just friends, and told him the truth.\n\nRoss maintains a fairly healthy relationship with Carol after their divorce and both decide to raise Ben together through [[shared parenting]], but he doesn't hide his contempt for Susan as he believes she destroyed their marriage and since she initially wanted to keep him out of Ben's life, having once told him to his face that the baby was not his and would not have the surname \"Geller\". He briefly considers getting back together with Carol and they even share a kiss at a sushi restaurant, but Carol makes it clear that she can't reciprocate his feelings and has chosen to be with Susan. In the second season, when Carol and Susan briefly call off their wedding due to Carol's homophobic parents' refusal to bless their relationship, Ross gives Carol away at the wedding and shares a dance with Susan, who develops a newfound respect for him.\n\nCarol's lack of romantic feelings towards Ross is reinforced in the alternate timeline episode \"The One that Could have Been\" (season 6). Exploring what could have happened if Ross and Carol never got divorced, it is revealed that they have been on a sexual dry spell that has lasted for months. Carol is very excited when Ross proposes they have a threesome with another woman. Picking Susan, whom she met at her gym just like in the real timeline, the two girls end up mostly having sex without Ross. He explains to Joey that he felt like a third wheel and ended up being so bored he made himself a sandwich. Ross realizes his wife is a lesbian when Rachel's \"could have been\" character states outright that Carol \"sounds gay.\"\n\n===Emily Waltham===\nDuring the [[Friends (season 4)|fourth season]], Ross meets and falls in love with Emily Waltham ([[Helen Baxendale]]), a British woman who is set up with Ross by Rachel. Six weeks into their relationship, Ross spontaneously asks Emily to move in with him. This escalates into a marriage proposal. The two plan a wedding in [[London]], to which [[Rachel Green|Rachel]] is invited.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Ross, upon seeing Rachel, has a slip of the tongue and says Rachel's name instead of Emily's during his vows. Emily is furious and exits her own wedding. Later, however, she decides to forgive Ross, and reaches the airport in time to leave for their honeymoon, but is upset when she sees Ross and Rachel boarding the plane together after Ross, having given up on meeting Emily at the airport, invites Rachel on their honeymoon as friend. She flees again, and Ross unsuccessfully tries to follow her, and Rachel ends up going on the honeymoon alone. Emily, later, calls Ross only to confront him by saying that he has to stop calling and harassing her relatives, but Ross makes her reveal her love for him. She said that she will return only if Ross stops being friends with Rachel. Unable to do so, Ross ends his marriage with Emily.\n\nShortly before Emily gets remarried to an anonymous man (although it might be assumed it is former lover Colin, whom she previously dumped to be with Ross), she gets cold feet and calls Ross to ask if their divorce was a mistake. While Ross is on a police ride-a-long with Phoebe's cop boyfriend Gary, Rachel hears and accidentally deletes Emily's message on the answering machine. Despite Monica pleading to keep Ross in the dark about it, Rachel tells him that Emily called, as she believes he should be in charge of his own happiness. When he starts to doubt whether or not he should return Emily's call, however, Rachel is quick to convince him not to. From this point onwards, Emily is never seen in the show again.\n\n== Reception ==\nRoss Geller has become a well-known figure in pop culture, in particular due to his relationship with Rachel Green, his neurotic nature, and his love for dinosaurs.\n\nIn 2015, a play titled ''Ross & Rachel'' debuted at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.assemblyfestival.com/event/125/|title=Ross & Rachel \u2013 Assembly Festival \u2013 Edinburgh Fringe|website=www.assemblyfestival.com|access-date=May 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2016, Ross Geller was voted \"the Best Friends Character\" in an international poll held by [[Comedy Central]], during six weeks of ''\"FriendsFest\"'' on the channel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.co.uk/friends/articles/our-favourite-ever-ross-moments|title=It's Official: Ross Geller Is The Best Friend|website=[[Comedy Central]]|accessdate=July 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of Friends characters|List of ''Friends'' characters]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Friends}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Geller, Ross}}\n[[Category:Friends (1994 TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional professors]]\n[[Category:Fictional paleontologists]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Fictional American Jews]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1994]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "188.141.15.36", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Fixed typo)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Geller"}

The ninth [[tropical cyclone naming|named storm]], first hurricane, and first major hurricane of the [[2011 Atlantic hurricane season]], Irene originated from a well-defined [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] [[tropical wave]] that began showing signs of organization east of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. Due to development of [[atmospheric convection]] and a closed center of circulation, the system was designated as Tropical Storm Irene on August&nbsp;20, 2011. After intensifying, Irene made [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in [[St. Croix]] as a strong tropical storm later that day. Early on August&nbsp;21, the storm made a second landfall in [[Puerto Rico]]. While crossing the island, Irene strengthened into a [[Category 1 hurricane]]. The storm paralleled offshore of [[Hispaniola]], continuing to slowly intensify in the process. Shortly before making four landfalls in the Bahamas, Irene peaked as a {{convert|120|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} Category&nbsp;3 hurricane.\n\nThereafter, the storm slowly leveled off in intensity as it struck the Bahamas and then curved northward after passing east of [[Grand Bahama]]. Continuing to weaken, Irene was downgraded to a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane before making landfall on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] on August&nbsp;27, becoming the first hurricane to make landfall in the United States since [[Hurricane Ike]] in 2008. Early on the following day, the storm re-emerged into the Atlantic from southeastern [[Virginia]]. Although Irene remained a hurricane over water, it weakened to a tropical storm while making yet another landfall in the [[Little Egg Inlet]] in southeastern [[New Jersey]] on August&nbsp;27. A few hours later, Irene made its ninth and final landfall in [[Brooklyn]], New York City. Early on August&nbsp;29, Irene transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] while striking [[Vermont]], after remaining inland as a tropical cyclone for less than 12&nbsp;hours.\n\nThroughout its path, Irene caused widespread destruction and at least 49 deaths. Damage estimates throughout the United States are estimated near $13.5 billion, making Irene one of the costliest hurricanes on record in the country. In addition, monetary losses in the Caribbean and Canada were $830&nbsp;million and $130&nbsp;million respectively for a total of nearly $14.2 billion in damage.<ref name=\"csr-damagetotal\">{{cite news|last=Fieser|first=Erza|title=Hurricane Irene barrels toward US as Caribbean islands take stock of damage|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2011/0825/Hurricane-Irene-barrels-toward-US-as-Caribbean-islands-take-stock-of-damage|accessdate=September 20, 2011|newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=August 25, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite report|title=Telling the Weather Story|date=June 4, 2012|publisher=Insurance Bureau of Canada|accessdate=July 19, 2015|url-status=live|url=http://assets.ibc.ca/Documents/Studies/McBean_Report.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6a8hB4BMq?url=http://assets.ibc.ca/Documents/Studies/McBean_Report.pdf|archivedate=July 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{Storm path|Irene 2011 track.png}}\nOn August 15, 2011, a [[tropical wave]] exited the west African coast, and emerged into the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], characterized by distinct low-level [[cyclonic rotation]] and deep tropical humidity.<ref name=\"twd-2p-15\">{{cite web|last=Walton|first=Corey|title=Tropical Weather Discussion|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/text/TWDAT/TWDAT.201108151746.txt|work=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=September 20, 2011|date=August 15, 2011}}</ref> It remained well-defined while moving steadily westward for several days to the south of the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]], although at the time any notable [[atmospheric convection|convection]] occurred well to the southwest of its axis.<ref name=\"twd-2p-16\">{{cite web|last=Walton|first=Corey|title=Tropical Weather Discussion|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/text/TWDAT/TWDAT.201108161748.txt|work=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=September 20, 2011|date=August 16, 2011}}</ref> As the wave distanced itself from the islands, development of thunderstorms and showers in its proximity continued to remain scarce, and it became rather broad in appearance.<ref name=\"gtwo-2a-18\">{{cite web|last=Cangialosi|first=John|title=Graphical Tropical Weather Outlook|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/gtwo/atl/201108180537/index.php?basin=atl|work=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=September 20, 2011|date=August 18, 2011}}</ref> On August 19, the convective structure began to show signs of organization as the associated [[atmospheric pressure]] lowered, and with a progressively favorable environment situated ahead of the wave its chances of undergoing [[tropical cyclogenesis]] markedly increased.<ref name=\"twd-8a-19\">{{cite web|last=Tichacek|first=Michael|title=Tropical Weather Discussion|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/text/TWDAT/TWDAT.201108191159.txt|work=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=September 20, 2011|date=August 19, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"gtwo-8a-20\">{{cite web|last=Beven|first=Jack|title=Graphical Tropical Weather Outlook|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/gtwo/atl/201108201203/index.php?basin=atl|work=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=September 20, 2011|date=August 20, 2011}}</ref> The strong thunderstorm activity continued to become more pronounced around the main [[Low-pressure area|low-pressure feature]].

The ninth [[tropical cyclone naming|named storm]], first hurricane, and first major hurricane of the [[2011 Atlantic hurricane season]], Irene originated from a well-defined [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] [[tropical wave]] that began showing signs of organization east of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. Due to development of [[atmospheric convection]] and a closed center of circulation, the system was designated as Tropical Storm Irene on August&nbsp;20, 2011. After intensifying, Irene made [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in [[St. Croix]] as a strong tropical storm later that day. Early on August&nbsp;21, the storm made a second landfall in [[Puerto Rico]]. While crossing the island, Irene strengthened into a [[Category 1 hurricane]]. The storm paralleled offshore of [[Hispaniola]], continuing to slowly intensify in the process. Shortly before making four landfalls in the Bahamas, Irene peaked as a {{convert|120|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} Category&nbsp;3 hurricane.\n\nThereafter, the storm slowly leveled off in intensity as it struck the Bahamas and then curved northward after passing east of [[Grand Bahama]]. Continuing to weaken, Irene was downgraded to a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane before making landfall on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] on August&nbsp;27, becoming the first hurricane to make landfall in the United States since [[Hurricane Ike]] in 2008. Early on the following day, the storm re-emerged into the Atlantic from southeastern [[Virginia]]. Although Irene remained a hurricane over water, it weakened to a tropical storm while making yet another landfall in the [[Little Egg Inlet]] in southeastern [[New Jersey]] on August&nbsp;27. A few hours later, Irene made its ninth and final landfall in [[Brooklyn]], New York City. Early on August&nbsp;29, Irene transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] while striking [[Vermont]], after remaining inland as a tropical cyclone for less than 12&nbsp;hours.\n\nThroughout its path, Irene caused widespread destruction and at least 49 deaths.
