This story was expanded and made into the full-length mystery ''[[Sparkling Cyanide]]'', featuring [[Colonel Race]] instead of Poirot.\n\n''Miss Marple Tells a Story'' is written in the [[First-person narrative|first person]] by [[Miss Marple|the elderly sleuth]], who recalls solving (without leaving her own chair) a seemingly impossible murder.\n\nIn ''The Dream'', an eccentric millionaire tells Poirot of a troubling dream in which he kills himself \u2013 and is found dead a week later.\n\n''In a Glass Darkly'' is the only story in the collection not to feature one of Christie's detectives (it is told by an anonymous narrator), and the only one to invoke the [[supernatural]]. Its title [[Allusion|alludes]] to the phrase \"[[Through a glass, darkly (phrase)|Through a glass darkly]]\", used by the [[Apostle Paul]] to describe how we currently view the world.\n\nIn ''Problem at Sea'', a rich woman is found dead in her cabin on a luxury ship off the shore of [[Alexandria]]. The story concludes with Poirot saying: \"I do not approve of murder.\"\n\n==Literary reception==\nIn ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' for 25 June 1939, Isaac Anderson mentioned by name ''Miss Marple Tells a Story'' and went on to say that, \"Neither this story nor any of the others is comparable to the longer works of Agatha Christie, but that is scarcely to be expected, for the detective story, more perhaps than any other type of fiction, needs continued suspense to hold the reader's interest, and very few authors have been able to manage that within the limits of the short story.\"<ref>''The New York Times Book Review'', 25 June 1939 (p. 6)</ref>\n\nAn unnamed reviewer in the ''[[Toronto Star|Toronto Daily Star]]'' (30 June 1939) wrote, regarding the title story ''The Regatta Mystery'', that \"Agatha Christie succeeds in baffling her readers ... [B]ut far from plausible is her solution\", and went on generally to say, \"The author is handicapped by attempting to compress her plots into 27-odd pages each. Nor has she opportunity for continued suspense.\"<ref>''Toronto Daily Star'', 30 June 1939 (p. 12)</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\n* 1939, Dodd, Mead and Company, Hardback, 229 pp\n* 1939, [[Lawrence E.
