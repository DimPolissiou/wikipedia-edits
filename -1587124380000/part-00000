The duration of the Dv\u0101para Yuga is 2,400 \u00d7 360, or 864,000 years.<ref name=web>{{Cite book|url=http://vedabase.com/sb/3/11/19/|title=SB 3.11.19|first=|last=|access-date=15 July 2011|website=vedabase.com|date=2011-07-15}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nThe Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a Time measurement section of the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a Book I Chapter III adds:\n\n* 2 Ayanas (6-month periods, see above) = 1 human year or 1 day of the devas.\n* 12,000 divine years = 4 Yugas (= 4,320,000 human years) = 1 Mah\u0101-Yuga (also is equal to 12,000 Daiva [divine] Yuga).\n* 2 \u00d7 12,000 = 24,000 divine year = 12000 revolutions of sun around its dual.\n\nWhile the long yuga count is the most popular, it does not correlate to any known celestial motion found in the [[Astronomical Almanac]]. The value of 24,000 years fits relatively close with the modern astronomical calculation of one full [[Axial precession (astronomy)#Effects|precession of the equinox]], which takes 25,772 years.{{efn|This phenomenon is observed as the stars moving retrograde across the sky at about 50 arc seconds per year, and is thought to produce periods of warm ages and ice ages known as the [[Milankovitch cycle]].}} Thus the yuga cycle may have some basis in known terrestrial cycles. [[Srimad Bhagavatam]] 3.11.19 describes the timespans of the [[demigod|deva]]s, in which a year of a yuga is a year of the demigods. It is this second sloka which appears to have been modified over the years.\n\n==Decline==\nThe ages see a gradual decline of dharma, wisdom, knowledge, intellectual capability, life span, emotional and physical strength.\n* ''[[Satya Yuga]]'' \u2013  Virtue reigns supreme.

Unaware that two women are hiding beneath the building, Mayans leader [[Marcus Alvarez]] orders the warehouse destroyed. As he's visiting a nearby convenience store, [[Jax Teller]], the vice-president of the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club - Redwood Original (SAMCRO), witnesses the resulting explosion.\n\nThe next morning, at the site of the explosion, Sheriff [[List of Sons of Anarchy characters#Vic Trammel|Vic Trammel]] {{ndash}} who is on SAMCRO's payroll {{ndash}} tells club president [[Clay Morrow]] that the warehouse was destroyed by [[arson]], showing him the bodies of the two women. Clay instructs Trammel to set up a meeting with the One-Niners, an [[East Bay]] [[street gang]] who buy weapons from SAMCRO. One-Niners leader [[List of Sons of Anarchy characters#Laroy Wayne|Laroy Wayne]], who needs SAMCRO's guns to cover for an incoming shipment of [[heroin]], gives Clay more time to replace the lost weapons.\n\nMeanwhile, Jax has moved into a spare room at SAMCRO's clubhouse after splitting up with his pregnant wife [[List of Sons of Anarchy characters#Wendy Case|Wendy Case]], who is addicted to [[methamphetamine]]. Looking through old belongings in his parents' garage, Jax finds old photographs of his late father [[List of Sons of Anarchy characters#John Teller|John]], the founder of SAMCRO, as well as a journal written for Jax detailing the history of the club. Jax is called away to a club meeting where SAMCRO's intelligence officer [[Juice Ortiz]] has traced the stolen guns to the Mayans in [[San Leandro, California|San Leandro]]. Clay wants to steal back the guns and torch the place where they were found.\n\nJax's mother, [[Gemma Teller Morrow]], finds Wendy unconscious, necessitating her being hospitalized and her baby being delivered ten weeks premature via [[Caesarean section]]. She takes her to the hospital and calls Jax, who then also shows up at the hospital. Dr. [[Tara Knowles]], Jax's high school sweetheart, tells him that the baby has a heart defect which, combined with Wendy's drug abuse, gives him just a 20% chance of survival. Jax flees the hospital without seeing his newborn son and beats Wendy's dealer. He later asks his best friend and lapsed club member [[Opie Winston]] to come along on the approaching raid on the Mayans' warehouse. Opie, an explosives expert, only reluctantly agrees as he was recently released from a five-year prison sentence after being caught during a similar raid.\n\nJax suggests that SAMCRO look into other ways of earning money besides gun running, but Clay prioritizes retrieving their stolen weapons. Later, Clay tells Jax that he can't be \"getting cold feet\" about the club, telling him that he and John sacrificed a lot to build SAMCRO. At the hospital, Wendy asks Jax to get rid of the drug stash at their home before she is jailed. He finds Gemma cleaning the house. Gemma admonishes Jax for abandoning the baby, telling him about the strength of the Teller men. Jax tells Gemma about John's journal, in which his father stated that SAMCRO has strayed away from his original vision of social rebellion. That night, Gemma tells Clay to stop Jax's new found mode of thinking, not wanting \"the ghost of John Teller\" to tear down everything they've built together.\n\nThe next day, the club members discuss the recent parole of [[Ernest Darby]] who leads the [[List of gangs from Sons of Anarchy#Nordics|Nordics]], a [[White supremacy|White supremacist]] gang of meth dealers. Clay, Jax and Bobby later meet up with Darby at a diner, and warn him to keep his drug dealing out of Charming.\n\nAt the hospital, Tara recommends that Abel's heart surgery happen today, and asks to privately talk to Gemma. She asks her to talk to Wendy and let her know that she has somebody, but Gemma says she would only give her [[vitriol]]. Tara asks if she has a problem with her being involved with the case, to which Gemma replies that as long as she's a good doctor, she couldn't care less. The two argue, with Tara claiming she's a different person to how she was 10 years ago. Gemma lifts up the back of her shirt, briefly exposing a biker tattoo. Tara claims that she has kept it to remind her that her past is behind her. Gemma exits, calling her a bitch as she leaves.\n\nThat night, Jax goes to Opie's house to bring him along on the raid and finds that his wife [[List of Sons of Anarchy characters#Donna Winston|Donna]] is angered because Opie is again involved with the club. Jax tells Opie to stay with his family, and makes an excuse to Clay that one of his children had an accident that needed his attention.\n\nMeanwhile, when Bobby arrives in Tahoe with Half-Sack, he is informed by the owner of the club where he is performing that there has been a double booking and that he will have to make a booking for another time. The other act that night is also an Elvis impersonator but is [[Asian people|Asian]] and there are a number of [[Koreans|Korean]] tourists going to see him, which means that he is favoured over Bobby. Half-Sack goes to the Asian's dressing room and beats him up so that he can't perform and Bobby can.\n\nIn San Leandro, Clay, Jax, Tig and [[Chibs Telford]] have ridden into town and they soon find the Mayans' stash of guns and [[heroin]]. However, after they break into the warehouse, a group of guards show up and Clay and Chibs shoot and kill the first few (wearing Mayans vests), leaving one that Clay forces Jax to kill. This man is [[White people|White]] and has a [[Swastika]] tattoo, implying that he is a Nord (and that the Mayans and Nords now have an alliance). Jax is hesitant to kill the man, implying that he truly is getting cold feet about the club, and Clay eventually does it when the Nord reaches for a gun. The group then use explosives to [[arson|blow up]] the stash, and the corpses in the process, before riding back to Charming with the guns.\n\nTara performs a successful surgery on Abel and Gemma visits Wendy, ridiculing her and telling her that the [[District Attorney]] is dropping any charges against her. Wendy says that she will get clean, now that she has her baby. Gemma threatens her, saying that if she tries to get custody of the child, she will kill her. Gemma then gives back the [[Bible]] Wendy was reading, now containing a needle, hinting that Gemma will discreetly allow Wendy to commit suicide via overdose. Jax also returns to the hospital, and reunites and embraces with Tara. She notices the blood on his clothes, and tells him to clean himself up. Wendy has an overdose in her hospital bed, as the doctors desperately try to save her. Jax finally visits his son.\n\n==Production==\nOriginally, [[Scott Glenn]] was cast in the role of [[Clay Morrow]] and an entire pilot episode was filmed with him.

In response to pathogenic tissue damage, ILCs contribute to immunity via the secretion of [[Cytokine|signalling molecules]], and the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune cells. Characteristics allowing their differentiation from other immune cells include the absence of regular [[Lymphocyte|lymphoid morphology]], rearranged antigen receptors found on [[T cell receptor|T cells]] and [[B cell receptor|B cells]] (due to the lack of the [[recombination-activating gene| RAG]] gene), and phenotypic markers usually present on [[Myelocyte|myeloid]] or [[dendritic cell]]s. <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Spits | first1 = Hergen | last2 = Cupedo | first2 = Tom | year = 2012 | title = Innate lymphoid cells: emerging insights in development, lineage relationships, and function | url = | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 647\u2013675 | doi=10.1146/annurev-immunol-020711-075053 | pmid=22224763}}</ref> ILCs are primarily tissue resident cells, found in both [[Lymphatic system|lymphoid]] (immune associated), and non- lymphoid tissues, and rarely in the peripheral blood.

Disturbance of the epithelium lining the hepatic [[bile duct]]s is frequently observed in response to chronic liver inflammation, and increased proliferation of these ducts is associated with liver cancer.<ref name=\"OchelTiegs2019\"/> Evidence suggests that the enhanced proliferation is triggered by IL-13, which is produced by IL-33 induced production of ILC2 cells. ILC2s have also been shown to enhance the progression of liver fibrosis, in turn promoting the development of liver cancer.<ref name=\"OchelTiegs2019\"/> \n\nThe availability of specific dietary nutrients can affect ILC immune homeostasis by altering the energy stored in the adipose tissue. Adipose tissue maintains metabolism homeostasis and is now considered a fully immunocompetent organ. [[Malnutrition]] and [[gluttony]] can dysregulate ILC responses via changes in dietary nutrients, having direct effects on the energy stored in the adipose tissue.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> Obesity is associated with changes of gastrointestinal flora, increased afflux of free [[fatty acid metabolism|fatty acids]] from adipose tissue into the liver and increased gut permeability.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> The close anatomical proximity of the gastrointestinal tract and the liver means [[transportation]] of bacterial metabolites through the [[portal vein]] triggers inflammation, acting on innate immune cells, including ILC1s, therefore playing an important role in the activation of an inflammatory state in the liver. Therefore, inflammation associated with obesity can influence the progression of liver disease, due to the development of insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> ILC1s as a key regulatory of adipose tissue inflammation, is therefore a potential therapeutic target for treating people with liver disease or [[metabolic syndrome]]. \n\nILC2s have also been identified in human and mouse [[white adipose tissue]], contributing to the development of obesity. Decreased responses of ILC2s in the tissue are a characteristic of obesity, as this interrupts their crucial role in energy homeostasis, resulting in reduced energy expenditure and increased adiposity.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n=== Skin inflammation ===\n\nThe frequency of ILC2s is higher in the inflamed skin of patients with [[atopic dermatitis]] than in healthy patients.<ref name=\"EbboCrinier2017\"/> The ILC2s from the skin of the patients had upregulation of the IL-25, IL-33, TSLP and PGD2 receptors, suggesting their role in the activation of ILC2s. [[Basophil]]s and mast cells are also present in these skin lesions, producing IL-4, and [[Prostaglandin D2|PGD2]], further activating ILC2s. \n\n[[File:ILCs in psoriasis 10 PNG.png|thumb|300px|alt= A diagram of the skin epidermis, and the ILC3s, and other effector cells (T cells, neutrophils) present in the environment, and their effector cytokines involved in causing psoriasis.|The ILCs present in the epidermis of patients with psoriasis, and the effector cytokines and cells involved in causing inflammation/ epidermal thickening.<ref name=\"EbboCrinier2017\"/>]]\n\n[[File:ILCs in atopic dermatitis 9 PNG FINAL.png|thumb|250px|center|alt= A diagram of the skin epidermis, and the ILC2s, and other effector cells (basophils, and mast cells) present in the environment, and their effector cytokines involved in causing atopic dermatitis.|The ILCs present in the epidermis of patients with atopic dermatitis, and the effector cells and cytokines involved in causing the pathophysiology of the disease.<ref name=\"EbboCrinier2017\"/>]]\n\n[[Psoriasis]], another inflammatory skin disease, causes epidermal thickening, forming plaques which are mainly populated with T cells and dendritic cells. The T cells portray a type 1 immune response; however, the thickening and inflammation of the epidermis is thought to be caused by the production of IL-22, IL-17A, and IL-17F by T cells.<ref name=\"EbboCrinier2017\"/> However, more recent data suggests that ILC3s infact produce a large number of these cytokines, with an increase in the number of ILC3s in the peripheral blood of patients with psoriasis.<ref name=\"EbboCrinier2017\"/>\n\n== Plasticity == \n\nOur classification of ILCs into subsets provides a simplified framework, however, despite the above [[#classification|classification]] system, several studies suggest their development and phenotypic maintenance is much more complex, with a high level of plasticity between the subsets. Studies have confirmed the ability of some ILC subsets to convert into a different subset in the presence of specific cytokines.<ref name=\"Colonna2018\">{{cite journal|last1=Colonna|first1=Marco|title=Innate Lymphoid Cells: Diversity, Plasticity, and Unique Functions in Immunity|journal=Immunity|volume=48|issue=6|year=2018|pages=1104\u20131117|issn=10747613|doi=10.1016/j.immuni.2018.05.013}}</ref> This is also a common feature in T cells, and it is believed this plasticity is critical to allow our immune system to fine tune responses to so many different pathogens. <ref name=\"Colonna2018\"/> ILC plasticity requires cytokine receptors, their transcription factors, and access of defined chromatin regions to the transcription factors, however, it still remains unclear where these cytokines are produced and where the differentiation occurs in Vivo.<ref name=\"VivierArtis2018\"/> \n\n[[File:ILCs in COPD 11 PNG FINAL.png|thumb|400px|alt= The lung epithelium after being triggered,by cigarette smoke, and the resulting effect this has on the ILCs in the microenvironment, in patients with COPD.

Beneath the mosaic is an inscription from Horace's ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'': \"Nil invita Minerva, quae monumentum aere perennius exegit, and translated as, Not unwilling, Minerva raises a monument more lasting than bronze.\"]]\nThe '''''Epistles''''' (or '''''Letters''''') of [[Horace]] were published in two books, in 20 BCE and 14 BCE, respectively.\n\n*'''''Epistularum liber primus''''' ('''''First Book of Letters''''') is the seventh work by Horace, published in the year 20 BC. This book consists of 20 Epistles. The phrase ''[[sapere aude]]'' (\"dare to be wise\") comes from this collection of poems.\n*'''''Epistularum liber secundus''''' ('''''Second Book of Letters''''') was published in the year 14 BC. This book consists of 3 Epistles. However, the third epistle \u2013 the [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]] \u2013 is usually treated as a separate composition.\n\n== Background ==\nAs one commentator has put it: \"Horace's ''Epistles'' may be said to be a continuation of his Satires in the form of letters... But few of the epistles are [actually] letters except in form...\"<ref name=\"Lonsdale\">The Works of Horace Rendered into English Prose by James Lonsdale M.A. and Samuel Lee M.A. London: MacMillan and Co., 1883. Edition is available on Google Books.</ref>{{rp|159}} They do indeed contain an excellent specimen of a letter of introduction (I.9); a piece of playful banter (I.14); pieces of friendly correspondence (I.3, I.4 and I.5); while the last, ''Epistle'' I.20, is inscribed 'To His Book,\" and forms a sort of epilogue to the ''Epistles'' he had already written. However, as a rule, the Epistles \"are compositions like those which Pope, following the manner of Horace, has made familiar to us as Moral Essays.\"<ref name=\"Lonsdale\"/>{{rp|159}}\n\nThe ''Epistles'' were published about four years after the first three books of ''Odes,'' and were introduced by a special address to his patron [[Maecenas]], as his ''Odes,'' ''Epodes,'' and ''Satires'' had been.<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Horace |volume=13 |pages=687-691}}</ref>{{rp|687\u201391}} The form of composition may have been suggested by some of the satires of [[Gaius Lucilius|Lucilius]], which were composed as letters to his personal friends...<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>{{rp|690}} \"From the ''Epistles''... we gather that [Horace] had gradually adopted a more retired and meditative life, and had become fonder of the country and of study, and that while owing allegiance to no school or sect of philosophy, he was framing for himself a scheme of life, was endeavoring to conform to it, and was bent on inculcating it in others.\"<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>{{rp|690}}\n\n\"In both his ''Satires'' and ''Epistles'', Horace shows himself a genuine moralist, a subtle observer and true painter of life, and an admirable writer.\" But in spirit the ''Epistles'' are more philosophic, more ethical and meditative. Like the ''Odes'' they exhibit the twofold aspects of Horace's philosophy, that of temperate Epicureanism and that of more serious and elevated conviction.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>{{rp|690}}\n\n== Book 1 ==\nBook 1 contains 20 Epistles.<ref name=\"Lonsdale\"/><ref>Horace, The Complete Works, ed. by Charles E. Bennett and John Carew Rolfe. Boston: Allyn and Bacon, 1901. Edition is available on Google Books.</ref>\n\n*'''I.1 \u2013 On the Importance of Philosophy''' - ''(Dedication to [[Maecenas]], Horace's Patron)\n:1-19 \u2013 Horace excuses himself to Maecenas for giving up the composition of lyric poetry, but he is better suited to philosophy as he grows older. However, he is not bound to any particular philosophic school.\n:20-40 \u2013 Wisdom is the true business of life; yet most of us must be content with but a moderate share of it: wisdom too is the only power which can tame our passions.\n:41-69 \u2013 Men will do and suffer anything to avoid poverty, but they will do nothing to gain virtue, which is more precious than gold. A clear conscience makes a man truly a king.\n:70-93 \u2013 He cannot follow the popular ideas, because he sees that they all tend one way - namely, to money-making. Besides, not only do men differ from one another in their pursuits, but no man is ever consistent with himself.\n:94-108 \u2013 External inconsistencies are noticed at once, while those of life and practice are passed over. This epistle ends with a joke on the Stoic doctrine of the perfect man.\n*'''I.2 \u2013 Homer: The Teacher of True Philosophy''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Lollius Maximus)''\n:1-31 \u2013 Horace begins by demonstrating, in the manner of the Stoic philosophers, the merit of Homer as a teacher of morals.\n:32-71 \u2013 Men will take more trouble for bad deeds than for good, and more for the body than the mind. Yet, without contentment and peace of mind, material acquisitions cannot be enjoyed. Avarice and envy are always beggars, and remorse comes after anger. Youth is the time to learn self-control. He shall always adhere to the philosophy of moderation.\n*'''I.3 \u2013 A Literary Staff''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Julius Florus)''\n:To Julius Florus, who was serving on the staff of Tiberius Claudius Nero. The letter consists mainly of inquiries and observations as to the literary pursuits of members of the staff; and concludes with a hope that the quarrel between Florus and Munatius has ended in a reconciliation.\n*'''I.4 \u2013 An Exhortation to Contentment''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to [[Albius Tibullus]], the Elegaic Poet)''\n:Horace urges his friend to enjoy each passing hour, and suggests that a visit to his Sabine Farm may divert him.\n*'''I.5 \u2013 An Invitation''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Manlius Torquatus, to whom Horace also wrote Ode IV.7)''\n:Horace invites his friend to dinner \u2013 Tomorrow is a holiday and Torquatus may well forget his occupations for a time. Horace then extols the virtues of wine (see also Ode III.21); and describes the preparations he is making for the banquet.\n*'''I.6 \u2013 On Philosophic Indifference''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Numicius)''\n:Equanimity is happiness \u2013 Fear and desire alike disturb our peace of mind. You will find this maxim true if you seek the chief good in any other pursuit \u2013 1) in riches, 2) in political honors, 3) in sumptuous living, or 4) in love and trifling. \n*'''I.7 \u2013 An Independent Spirit''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Maecenas)''\n:1-24 \u2013 Horace excuses himself to Maecenas for not keeping his promise to come to Rome, on the ground that it would be dangerous to his health. He feels that this reason will satisfy Maecenas, as being a friend who has always had a sincere regard for his welfare.\n:25-45 \u2013 If Maecenas would want him to always be at Rome, then Horace must have back his health and youth. He must be free, even if freedom costs him the loss of all Maecenas' favors. Horace would give back all, as Telemachus refused the horses which were unsuited to his poor and rocky island.\n:46-95 \u2013 The story of Volteius Mena and his patron L. Marcius Philippus, with an implied allusion to the relationship between Horace and Maecenas. The attainment of our wishes does not always make us happy.\n*'''I.8 \u2013 A Word of Warning''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Celsus Albinovanus, who was serving on the staff of Tiberius in the province of Asia)''\n:This letter seems to be a reply. Horace speaks of his own fickleness and discontent, and gently recommends moderation to Celsus in prosperity.\n*'''I.9 \u2013 A Letter of Recommendation''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Tiberius)''\n:This letter is written to the future emperor Tiberius, in behalf of Titius Septimius, to whom Ode II.6 is addressed.\n*'''I.10 \u2013 The Advantages of Country Life''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to [[Aristius Fuscus]], to whom Ode I.22 is also addressed)''\n:This epistle begins with Horace contrasting his own love of the country with his friend's fondness for the town; then follows the praise of Nature; and finally the poet dwells on the superior happiness that moderate means and contentment afford, compared with riches and ambition.\n*'''I.11 \u2013 On Contentment''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Bullatius)''\n:To Bullatius who is travelling to Ionia \u2013 Change of scene does not alter the mind. If the mind is tranquil, the meanest and least interesting of places seem agreeable.\n*'''I.12 \u2013 Consolation''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Iccius, to whom Ode I.29 is also addressed)''\n:Horace advises Iccius, who is now steward of Agrippa's property in Sicily, to be content, and compliments him on pursuing the study of philosophy. He then encourages him to cultivate the friendship of Pompeius Grosphus, and tells him the news at Rome.\n*'''I.13 \u2013 Instructions to a Messenger''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Vinius Asina)''\n:Horace sends a copy of his ''Odes'' to Augustus by a friend of his court circles \u2013 Vinius Asina. The poet writes a playful note of instruction to the messenger, whom he likens (on account of his name \"Asina\") to a beast of burden.\n*'''I.14 \u2013 Master to Bailiff''' \u2013 \n:Horace writes a letter to his bailiff, who dislikes the country and longs to return to city life; while Horace, detained at Rome, has his heart in the country.\n*'''I.15 \u2013 A Request for Information'''  \u2013 ''(Addressed to Numonius Vala)''\n:Horace has decided to spend the winter at the seashore, and now writes to his friend for information about the climate and resources of Velia and Salernum.\n*'''I.16 \u2013 Happiness Depends Upon Virtue''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Quinctius Hirpinus, to whom Ode II.11 is also addressed)''\n:1-16 \u2013 Horace describes the simple attractions of his Sabine Farm.\n:17-45 \u2013 Advice to his friend not to value too highly the admiration of the masses \u2013 their honors can be taken away.\n:46-62 \u2013 Many a man who seems to be good is actuated by fear, not love \u2013 his morality is hollow.\n:63-79 \u2013 The miser is a slave to his money. The good man is free and fearless, come what will.\n*'''I.17 \u2013 On True Independence''' \u2013 ''(Address to Scaeva)''\n:Horace shows that one may observe proper deference towards a patron without sacrificing one's self-respect. He gives some humorous directions for gaining the favor of great men.\n*'''I.18 \u2013 On the Proper Demeanor Towards a Patron''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Lollius Maximum)''\n:As in ''Epistle'' I.17, Horace assures a friend that he can show proper deference to a patron, without laying himself open to the charge of obsequiousness.\n*'''I.19 \u2013 The Poet on His Critics''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Maecenas)''\n:The ''Odes'' (Books I\u2013III) had evidently met with unfavorable criticism outside the small circle of the poet's friends. He points out to Maecenas the injustice of the charges which have been made against him, and expresses contempt for his detractors.\n*'''I.20 \u2013 Epilogue''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to His Book)''\n:Horace warns his book of ''Epistles'' of the fate that attends publishing. He compares it to a young and beautiful slave, and foretells its destiny \u2013 1) Success until it falls into the hands of the vulgar; 2) Banishment to the provinces; 3) An old age spent in schools.\n\n==Book 2==\nBook 2 consists of 3 ''epistles.'' However, the third epistle \u2013 the ''Ars Poetica'' \u2013 is usually treated as a separate composition. (For further discussion, see the Wikipedia article on the ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'').\n\n*'''II.1 \u2013 On Popular Taste and Judgment''' \u2013 ''(Dedication to Augustus)''\n:Horace dedicates his second collection of ''Epistles'' to Augustus, who had apparently urged him to undertake something in the line of dramatic or epic poetry. He complains of the poor taste shown by the general public, especially in regard to the drama, and says that he is unwilling to make an attempt in that line. For epic poetry he has no ability.\n*'''II.2 \u2013 A Renunciation of Lyric Poetry''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Julius Florus, to whom ''Epistle'' I.3 is also addressed)\n:Horace expresses at greater length the same general sentiments as in ''Epistle'' I.1 \u2013 He intends to devote himself to philosophy and to write only in the field represented by the ''Satires'' and ''Epistles.''\n*'''II.3 \u2013 ''Ars Poetica'' \u2013 The Art of Poetry''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to The Pisos)''\n:''(For further discussion, see the Wikipedia article on the ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'')''\n:''The ''Ars Poetica'' is dedicated to Horace's friend [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 15 BCE)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso]] (the Roman senator and consul) and his two sons.''\n:1-23 \u2013 Unity and simplicity are necessary in a poem.\n:24-37 \u2013 We, who would be poets, must guard against all extremes.\n:38-44 \u2013 We must well consider our powers before we write.\n:45-72 \u2013 We may coin new words when necessary, but this must be done with care: words, like all other things, are subject to change.\n:73-85 \u2013 The various kinds of poetry: epic, elegiac, dramatic, lyric.\n:86-98 \u2013 We must suit our style to the different kinds of poetry.\n:99-118 \u2013 The words also must be suitable to the character in whose mouth the poet puts them.\n:119-152 \u2013 A writer should follow the traditions of the Muse; or, if he strikes out something new, must be consistent. No better guide can we follow than Homer.\n:153-178 \u2013 A writer too should observe the characteristics of each age of man.\n:179-188 \u2013 Some things should be represented on the stage, others related to the spectators.\n:189-201 \u2013 Certain rules not to be transgressed. The role of the Chorus.\n:202-219 \u2013 Of the music of the stage, and how it changes with the fortunes and manners of the people.\n:220-250 \u2013 The Satyric drama, which accompanied the tragedy, is not the same as comedy, and has its rules and wholesome restraints.\n:251-274 \u2013 On the Iambic and Spondee. The Greek taste is to be followed, rather than the license of the Roman poets, in respect to meter.\n:275-294 \u2013 The origin of tragedy & its development. To it succeeded the old comedy \u2013 vigorous, but scurrilous. The Latin poets deserve some praise, but their great fault is their careless, slovenly style.\n:295-308 \u2013 Genius cannot afford to dispense with the rules of art.

However, as a rule, the Epistles \"are compositions like those which Pope, following the manner of Horace, has made familiar to us as Moral Essays.\"<ref name=\"Lonsdale\"/>{{rp|159}}\n\nThe ''Epistles'' were published about four years after the first three books of ''Odes,'' and were introduced by a special address to his patron [[Maecenas]], as his ''Odes,'' ''Epodes,'' and ''Satires'' had been.<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Horace |volume=13 |pages=687-691}}</ref>{{rp|687\u201391}} The form of composition may have been suggested by some of the satires of [[Gaius Lucilius|Lucilius]], which were composed as letters to his personal friends...<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>{{rp|690}} \"From the ''Epistles''... we gather that [Horace] had gradually adopted a more retired and meditative life, and had become fonder of the country and of study, and that while owing allegiance to no school or sect of philosophy, he was framing for himself a scheme of life, was endeavoring to conform to it, and was bent on inculcating it in others.\"<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>{{rp|690}}\n\n\"In both his ''Satires'' and ''Epistles'', Horace shows himself a genuine moralist, a subtle observer and true painter of life, and an admirable writer.\" But in spirit the ''Epistles'' are more philosophic, more ethical and meditative.

Edition is available on Google Books.</ref>\n\n*'''I.1 \u2013 On the Importance of Philosophy''' - ''(Dedication to [[Maecenas]], Horace's Patron)\n:1-19 \u2013 Horace excuses himself to Maecenas for giving up the composition of lyric poetry, but he is better suited to philosophy as he grows older. However, he is not bound to any particular philosophic school.\n:20-40 \u2013 Wisdom is the true business of life; yet most of us must be content with but a moderate share of it: wisdom too is the only power which can tame our passions.\n:41-69 \u2013 Men will do and suffer anything to avoid poverty, but they will do nothing to gain virtue, which is more precious than gold. A clear conscience makes a man truly a king.\n:70-93 \u2013 He cannot follow the popular ideas, because he sees that they all tend one way - namely, to money-making. Besides, not only do men differ from one another in their pursuits, but no man is ever consistent with himself.\n:94-108 \u2013 External inconsistencies are noticed at once, while those of life and practice are passed over. This epistle ends with a joke on the Stoic doctrine of the perfect man.\n*'''I.2 \u2013 Homer: The Teacher of True Philosophy''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Lollius Maximus)''\n:1-31 \u2013 Horace begins by demonstrating, in the manner of the Stoic philosophers, the merit of Homer as a teacher of morals.\n:32-71 \u2013 Men will take more trouble for bad deeds than for good, and more for the body than the mind. Yet, without contentment and peace of mind, material acquisitions cannot be enjoyed. Avarice and envy are always beggars, and remorse comes after anger. Youth is the time to learn self-control. He shall always adhere to the philosophy of moderation.\n*'''I.3 \u2013 A Literary Staff''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Julius Florus)''\n:To Julius Florus, who was serving on the staff of Tiberius Claudius Nero. The letter consists mainly of inquiries and observations as to the literary pursuits of members of the staff; and concludes with a hope that the quarrel between Florus and Munatius has ended in a reconciliation.\n*'''I.4 \u2013 An Exhortation to Contentment''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to [[Albius Tibullus]], the Elegaic Poet)''\n:Horace urges his friend to enjoy each passing hour, and suggests that a visit to his Sabine Farm may divert him.\n*'''I.5 \u2013 An Invitation''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Manlius Torquatus, to whom Horace also wrote Ode IV.7)''\n:Horace invites his friend to dinner \u2013 Tomorrow is a holiday and Torquatus may well forget his occupations for a time. Horace then extols the virtues of wine (see also Ode III.21); and describes the preparations he is making for the banquet.\n*'''I.6 \u2013 On Philosophic Indifference''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Numicius)''\n:Equanimity is happiness \u2013 Fear and desire alike disturb our peace of mind. You will find this maxim true if you seek the chief good in any other pursuit \u2013 1) in riches, 2) in political honors, 3) in sumptuous living, or 4) in love and trifling. \n*'''I.7 \u2013 An Independent Spirit''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Maecenas)''\n:1-24 \u2013 Horace excuses himself to Maecenas for not keeping his promise to come to Rome, on the ground that it would be dangerous to his health. He feels that this reason will satisfy Maecenas, as being a friend who has always had a sincere regard for his welfare.\n:25-45 \u2013 If Maecenas would want him to always be at Rome, then Horace must have back his health and youth. He must be free, even if freedom costs him the loss of all Maecenas' favors. Horace would give back all, as Telemachus refused the horses which were unsuited to his poor and rocky island.\n:46-95 \u2013 The story of Volteius Mena and his patron L. Marcius Philippus, with an implied allusion to the relationship between Horace and Maecenas. The attainment of our wishes does not always make us happy.\n*'''I.8 \u2013 A Word of Warning''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Celsus Albinovanus, who was serving on the staff of Tiberius in the province of Asia)''\n:This letter seems to be a reply. Horace speaks of his own fickleness and discontent, and gently recommends moderation to Celsus in prosperity.\n*'''I.9 \u2013 A Letter of Recommendation''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Tiberius)''\n:This letter is written to the future emperor Tiberius, in behalf of Titius Septimius, to whom Ode II.6 is addressed.\n*'''I.10 \u2013 The Advantages of Country Life''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to [[Aristius Fuscus]], to whom Ode I.22 is also addressed)''\n:This epistle begins with Horace contrasting his own love of the country with his friend's fondness for the town; then follows the praise of Nature; and finally the poet dwells on the superior happiness that moderate means and contentment afford, compared with riches and ambition.\n*'''I.11 \u2013 On Contentment''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Bullatius)''\n:To Bullatius who is travelling to Ionia \u2013 Change of scene does not alter the mind. If the mind is tranquil, the meanest and least interesting of places seem agreeable.\n*'''I.12 \u2013 Consolation''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Iccius, to whom Ode I.29 is also addressed)''\n:Horace advises Iccius, who is now steward of Agrippa's property in Sicily, to be content, and compliments him on pursuing the study of philosophy. He then encourages him to cultivate the friendship of Pompeius Grosphus, and tells him the news at Rome.\n*'''I.13 \u2013 Instructions to a Messenger''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Vinius Asina)''\n:Horace sends a copy of his ''Odes'' to Augustus by a friend of his court circles \u2013 Vinius Asina. The poet writes a playful note of instruction to the messenger, whom he likens (on account of his name \"Asina\") to a beast of burden.\n*'''I.14 \u2013 Master to Bailiff''' \u2013 \n:Horace writes a letter to his bailiff, who dislikes the country and longs to return to city life; while Horace, detained at Rome, has his heart in the country.\n*'''I.15 \u2013 A Request for Information'''  \u2013 ''(Addressed to Numonius Vala)''\n:Horace has decided to spend the winter at the seashore, and now writes to his friend for information about the climate and resources of Velia and Salernum.\n*'''I.16 \u2013 Happiness Depends Upon Virtue''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Quinctius Hirpinus, to whom Ode II.11 is also addressed)''\n:1-16 \u2013 Horace describes the simple attractions of his Sabine Farm.\n:17-45 \u2013 Advice to his friend not to value too highly the admiration of the masses \u2013 their honors can be taken away.\n:46-62 \u2013 Many a man who seems to be good is actuated by fear, not love \u2013 his morality is hollow.\n:63-79 \u2013 The miser is a slave to his money. The good man is free and fearless, come what will.\n*'''I.17 \u2013 On True Independence''' \u2013 ''(Address to Scaeva)''\n:Horace shows that one may observe proper deference towards a patron without sacrificing one's self-respect. He gives some humorous directions for gaining the favor of great men.\n*'''I.18 \u2013 On the Proper Demeanor Towards a Patron''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Lollius Maximum)''\n:As in ''Epistle'' I.17, Horace assures a friend that he can show proper deference to a patron, without laying himself open to the charge of obsequiousness.\n*'''I.19 \u2013 The Poet on His Critics''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Maecenas)''\n:The ''Odes'' (Books I\u2013III) had evidently met with unfavorable criticism outside the small circle of the poet's friends. He points out to Maecenas the injustice of the charges which have been made against him, and expresses contempt for his detractors.\n*'''I.20 \u2013 Epilogue''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to His Book)''\n:Horace warns his book of ''Epistles'' of the fate that attends publishing. He compares it to a young and beautiful slave, and foretells its destiny \u2013 1) Success until it falls into the hands of the vulgar; 2) Banishment to the provinces; 3) An old age spent in schools.\n\n==Book 2==\nBook 2 consists of 3 ''epistles.'' However, the third epistle \u2013 the ''Ars Poetica'' \u2013 is usually treated as a separate composition. (For further discussion, see the Wikipedia article on the ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'').\n\n*'''II.1 \u2013 On Popular Taste and Judgment''' \u2013 ''(Dedication to Augustus)''\n:Horace dedicates his second collection of ''Epistles'' to Augustus, who had apparently urged him to undertake something in the line of dramatic or epic poetry. He complains of the poor taste shown by the general public, especially in regard to the drama, and says that he is unwilling to make an attempt in that line. For epic poetry he has no ability.\n*'''II.2 \u2013 A Renunciation of Lyric Poetry''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to Julius Florus, to whom ''Epistle'' I.3 is also addressed)\n:Horace expresses at greater length the same general sentiments as in ''Epistle'' I.1 \u2013 He intends to devote himself to philosophy and to write only in the field represented by the ''Satires'' and ''Epistles.''\n*'''II.3 \u2013 ''Ars Poetica'' \u2013 The Art of Poetry''' \u2013 ''(Addressed to The Pisos)''\n:''(For further discussion, see the Wikipedia article on the ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'')''\n:''The ''Ars Poetica'' is dedicated to Horace's friend [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 15 BCE)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso]] (the Roman senator and consul) and his two sons.''\n:1-23 \u2013 Unity and simplicity are necessary in a poem.\n:24-37 \u2013 We, who would be poets, must guard against all extremes.\n:38-44 \u2013 We must well consider our powers before we write.\n:45-72 \u2013 We may coin new words when necessary, but this must be done with care: words, like all other things, are subject to change.\n:73-85 \u2013 The various kinds of poetry: epic, elegiac, dramatic, lyric.\n:86-98 \u2013 We must suit our style to the different kinds of poetry.\n:99-118 \u2013 The words also must be suitable to the character in whose mouth the poet puts them.\n:119-152 \u2013 A writer should follow the traditions of the Muse; or, if he strikes out something new, must be consistent. No better guide can we follow than Homer.\n:153-178 \u2013 A writer too should observe the characteristics of each age of man.\n:179-188 \u2013 Some things should be represented on the stage, others related to the spectators.\n:189-201 \u2013 Certain rules not to be transgressed. The role of the Chorus.\n:202-219 \u2013 Of the music of the stage, and how it changes with the fortunes and manners of the people.\n:220-250 \u2013 The Satyric drama, which accompanied the tragedy, is not the same as comedy, and has its rules and wholesome restraints.\n:251-274 \u2013 On the Iambic and Spondee. The Greek taste is to be followed, rather than the license of the Roman poets, in respect to meter.\n:275-294 \u2013 The origin of tragedy & its development. To it succeeded the old comedy \u2013 vigorous, but scurrilous. The Latin poets deserve some praise, but their great fault is their careless, slovenly style.\n:295-308 \u2013 Genius cannot afford to dispense with the rules of art.
