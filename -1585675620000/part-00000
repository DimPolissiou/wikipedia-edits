The attackers were commanded by the 21-year-old [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]] [[Mehmed II]], who defeated an army commanded by [[Byzantine Emperor|Emperor]] [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] and took control of the imperial capital, ending a 53-day siege that had begun on 6 April 1453. After conquering the city, Sultan Mehmed transferred the capital of the Ottoman State from [[Edirne|Adrianople]] to Constantinople and established his court there.\n\nThe capture of the city (and two other Byzantine splinter territories soon thereafter) marked the end of the [[Roman Empire]], a state which dated to 27 BC, which had lasted for nearly 1,500 years.<ref name=\"ms97\" /> The conquest of Constantinople also dealt a massive blow to the defence of mainland Europe, as the Muslim Ottoman armies thereafter were left unchecked to advance into Europe without an adversary to their rear.\n\nIt was also a watershed moment in military history. Since ancient times, cities had used ramparts and city walls to protect themselves from invaders, and Constantinople's substantial fortifications had been a model followed by cities throughout the Mediterranean region and Europe. The Ottomans ultimately prevailed due to the use of [[gunpowder]] (which powered formidable cannons).<ref name=\"econfallmill\" />\n\nThe conquest of the city of Constantinople and the end of the Byzantine Empire<ref name=\"ealoipolis\" /> was a key event in the [[Late Middle Ages]] which also marks, for some historians, the end of the Medieval period.<ref name=\"GpAG8\" />\n\n==State of the Byzantine Empire==\n[[Constantinople]] had been an imperial capital since its consecration in 330 under Roman emperor [[Constantine the Great]]. In the following eleven centuries, the city had been [[List of sieges of Constantinople|besieged many times]] but was captured only once: during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|304}} The crusaders established an unstable [[Latin Empire|Latin state]] in and around Constantinople while the remaining empire splintered into a number of Byzantine successor states, notably [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] and [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]]. They fought as allies against the Latin establishments, but also fought among themselves for the Byzantine throne.\n\nThe Nicaeans eventually reconquered Constantinople from the Latins in 1261, reestablishing the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty. Thereafter, there was little peace for the much-weakened empire as it fended off successive attacks by the Latins, the [[Serbia]]ns, the [[Bulgaria]]ns, and, most importantly, the [[Ottoman Turks]].<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" /><ref name=\"O2kxx\" /><ref name=\"ospbyzwar6001453\" /><ref name=\"oxhistbyzmango\" /> The [[Black Plague]] between 1346 and 1349 killed almost half of the inhabitants of Constantinople.<ref name=\"rCeS6\" /> The city was further depopulated by the general economic and territorial decline of the empire, and by 1453 consisted of a series of walled villages separated by vast fields encircled by the fifth-century [[Theodosian Walls]].\n\nBy 1450 the empire was exhausted and had shrunk to a few square kilometres outside the city of Constantinople itself, the [[Princes' Islands]] in the [[Sea of Marmara]], and the [[Peloponnese]] with its cultural centre at [[Mystras]]. The [[Empire of Trebizond]], an independent [[successor state]] that formed in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, also survived on the coast of the [[Black Sea]].\n\n==Preparations==\nWhen Sultan [[Mehmed II]] succeeded his father in 1451, he was just nineteen years old.  Many European courts assumed that the young Ottoman ruler would not seriously challenge Christian hegemony in the [[Balkans]] and the Aegean.<ref name=\"nbpyu\" /> This calculation was boosted by Mehmed's friendly overtures to the European envoys at his new court.<ref name=\"cJRwI\" /> But Mehmed's mild words were not matched by actions. By early 1452, work began on the construction of a second [[fortress]] (''[[Rumelihisar\u0131|Rumeli hisar\u0131]]'') on the [[Bosphorus]],<ref name=\"WDL\" /> on the European side several miles north of Constantinople, set directly across the strait on the Asian side from the ''[[Anadoluhisar\u0131|Anadolu Hisar\u0131]]'' fortress, built by his great-grandfather [[Bayezid I]]. This pair of fortresses ensured complete control of sea traffic on the Bosphorus;<ref name=\"MBVR8\" /> and defended against attack by the [[Genoa|Genoese]] colonies on the Black Sea coast to the north. (This new fortress, was called  ''Bo\u011fazkesen'', which means 'strait-blocker' or 'throat-cutter', to emphasize its strategic position.) In October 1452, Mehmed ordered [[Turakhan Beg]] to station a large garrison force in the [[Peloponnese]] to block [[Thomas Palaiologos|Thomas]] and [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]] ([[despotes]] in Southern Greece) from providing aid to their brother [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] during the impending siege of Constantinople.{{NoteTag|While Mehmed II had been steadily preparing for the siege of Constantinople, he had sent the old general Turakhan and the latter's two sons, Ahmed Beg and Omar Beg, to invade the [[Morea]] and to remain there all winter also to prevent the despots Thomas and Demetrius from giving aid to Constantine XI.<ref name=\"setpapacylevant\" />{{rp|146}}}}  [[Michael Critobulus]] quotes the speech of Mehmed II to his soldiers: \"My friends and men of my empire! You all know very well that our forefathers secured this kingdom that we now hold at the cost of many struggles and very great dangers and that, having passed it along in succession from their fathers, from father to son, they handed it down to me. For some of the oldest of you were sharers in many of the exploits carried through by them\u2014those at least of you who are of maturer years\u2014and the younger of you have heard of these deeds from your fathers. They are not such very ancient events nor of such a sort as to be forgotten through the lapse of time. Still, the eyewitness of those who have seen testifies better than does the hearing of deeds that happened but yesterday or the day before.\"\n\n===European support===\n[[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine XI]] swiftly understood Mehmed's true intentions and turned to [[Western Europe]] for help; but now the price of centuries of war and enmity between the [[Eastern Christianity|eastern]] and [[Western Christianity|western churches]] had to be paid. Since the [[East\u2013West Schism|mutual excommunications]] of 1054, the [[pope]] in Rome was committed to establishing authority over [[Eastern Orthodox Church|the eastern church]]. The Union was agreed by the Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] in 1274, at the [[Second Council of Lyon]], and indeed, some Palaiologoi emperors (Latin, Palaeologan) had since been received into the [[Latin Church]]. Emperor [[John VIII Palaiologos]] had also recently negotiated union with [[Pope Eugene IV]], with the [[Council of Florence#Eugene IV's eastern strategy|Council of Florence]] of 1439 proclaiming a ''Bull of Union''. The imperial efforts to impose union were met with strong resistance in Constantinople. A propaganda initiative was stimulated by anti-unionist [[Greek Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] partisans in Constantinople; the population, as well as the laity and leadership of the Byzantine Church, became bitterly divided. Latent [[ethnic hatred]] between Greeks and Italians, stemming from the events of the [[Massacre of the Latins]] in 1182 by the Greeks and the [[Fourth Crusade|sack of Constantinople]] in 1204 by the Latins, played a significant role. Ultimately, the attempted Union failed, greatly annoying [[Pope Nicholas V]] and the hierarchy of the Roman church.\n\n[[File:Eastern Mediterranean 1450 .svg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The Byzantine Empire in the first half of the 15th&nbsp;century. Thessaloniki was captured by the Ottomans in 1430. A few islands in the Aegean and the [[Propontis]] remained under Byzantine rule until 1453 (not shown on the map).]]\n\nIn the summer of 1452, when [[Rumelihisar\u0131|Rumel\u0131 Hisari]] was completed and the threat had become imminent, Constantine wrote to the Pope, promising to implement the Union, which was declared valid by a half-hearted imperial court on 12 December 1452.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|373}} Although he was eager for an advantage, Pope Nicholas V did not have the influence the Byzantines thought he had over the Western kings and princes, some of whom were wary of increasing papal control, and these had not the wherewithal to contribute to the effort, especially in light of the weakened state of France and England from the [[Hundred Years' War]], Spain, being in the final part of the [[Reconquista]], the internecine fighting in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and Hungary and Poland's defeat at the [[Battle of Varna]] of 1444. Although some troops did arrive from the mercantile city-states in the north of Italy, the Western contribution was not adequate to counterbalance Ottoman strength. Some Western individuals, however, came to help defend the city on their own account. Cardinal Isidore, funded by the pope, arrived in 1452 with 200 archers.<ref name=\"qGd6u\" /> An accomplished soldier from [[Genoa]], [[Giovanni Giustiniani]],  arrived with 400 men from Genoa and 300 men from Genoese Chios, in January 1453.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|83\u201384}} As a specialist in defending walled cities, he was immediately given the overall command of the defence of the land walls by the emperor. Around the same time, the captains of the Venetian ships that happened to be present in the [[Golden Horn]] offered their services to the Emperor, barring contrary orders from [[Venice]], and Pope Nicholas undertook to send three ships laden with provisions, which set sail near the end of March.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|81}}\n\nIn Venice, meanwhile, deliberations were taking place concerning the kind of assistance the Republic would lend to Constantinople. The Senate decided upon sending a fleet in February 1453, but there were delays, and when it finally set out late in April, it was already too late for it to be able to take part in the battle.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|85}} Further undermining Byzantine morale, seven Italian ships with around 700 men slipped out of the capital at the moment when Giustiniani arrived, men who had sworn to defend the capital. At the same time, Constantine's attempts to appease the Sultan with gifts ended with the execution of the Emperor's ambassadors\u2014even Byzantine diplomacy could not save the city.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|373}}<ref name=\"ThackerayFindling2012\" /><ref name=\"Norwich1998\" /><ref name=\"Somerwil-Ayrton2007\" /><ref name=\"Roberts1973\" /><ref name=\"Brownworth2009\" /><ref name=\"Norwich v.3\" />\n\n[[File:Walls of Constantinople.JPG|right|thumb|upright=1|Restored Walls of Constantinople]]\n[[File:Hali\u00e7 zinciri (2).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[boom (navigational barrier)|chain]] that closed off the entrance to the Golden Horn in 1453, now on display in the [[\u0130stanbul Archaeology Museums]].]]\n\nFearing a possible naval attack along the shores of the Golden Horn, Emperor Constantine XI ordered that a [[boom (navigational barrier)|defensive chain]] be placed at the mouth of the harbour. This chain, which floated on logs, was strong enough to prevent any Turkish ship from entering the harbour. This device was one of two that gave the Byzantines some hope of extending the siege until the possible arrival of foreign help.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{rp|380}} This strategy was enforced because in 1204 the armies of the Fourth Crusade successfully circumvented Constantinople's land defences by breaching the Golden Horn Wall. Another strategy employed by the Byzantines was the repair and fortification of the Land Wall (Theodosian Walls). Emperor Constantine deemed it necessary to ensure that the [[Blachernae]] district's wall was the most fortified because that section of the wall protruded northwards. The land fortifications comprised a {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide moat fronting inner and outer [[Battlement|crenellated walls]] studded with towers every 45\u201355 metres.<ref name=\"f6GY9\" />\n\n===Strength===\n[[File:Siege of Constantinople 1453 map-fr.svg|thumb|left|Map of Constantinople and the dispositions of the defenders and the besiegers]]\n\nThe army defending Constantinople was relatively small, totalling about 7,000 men, 2,000 of whom were foreigners.{{NoteTag|According to Sphrantzes, whom Constantine had ordered to make a census, the Emperor was appalled when the number of native men capable of bearing arms turned out to be only 4,983. Leonardo di Chio gave a number of 6,000 Greeks.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|85}}}} At the onset of the siege, probably fewer than 50,000 people were living within the walls, including the refugees from the surrounding area.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|32}} {{NoteTag|The Spanish [[Crist\u00f3bal de Villal\u00f3n]] claims there were ' 60,000 Turkish households, 40,000 Greek and Armenian, 10,000 Jewish.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|85}}}} Turkish commander Dorgano, who was in Constantinople in the pay of the Emperor, was also guarding one of the quarters of the city on the seaward side with the Turks in his pay. These Turks kept loyal to the Emperor and perished in the ensuing battle. The defending army's Genoese corps were well trained and equipped, while the rest of the army consisted of small numbers of well-trained soldiers, armed civilians, sailors and volunteer forces from foreign communities, and finally [[monks]]. The garrison used a few small-calibre artillery pieces, which nonetheless proved ineffective. The rest of the citizens repaired walls, stood guard on observation posts, collected and distributed food provisions, and collected gold and silver objects from churches to melt down into coins to pay the foreign soldiers.\n\nThe Ottomans had a much larger force. Recent studies and Ottoman archival data state that there were about 50,000\u201380,000 Ottoman soldiers including between 5,000 and 10,000 [[Janissary|Janissaries]],<ref name=\"pertusicadvol1\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}, 70 [[cannon]]s<ref name=\"battle100\" />{{rp|139\u2013140}}<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}<ref name=\"halilosmanimpklas\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}, an elite infantry corps, and thousands of Christian troops, notably 1,500 Serbian cavalry{{cn|date=February 2020}} that the [[Serbs|Serbian]] lord [[\u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107]] was forced to supply as part of his obligation to the Ottoman sultan\u2014just a few months before, he had supplied the money for the reconstruction of the walls of Constantinople.

They were built at [[foundries]] that employed Turkish cannon founders and technicians, most notably Saruca, in addition to at least one foreign cannon founder, [[Orban]] (also called Urban). Most of the cannons at the siege were built by Turkish engineers, including a large bombard by Saruca, while one cannon was built by Orban, who contributed a large bombard.<ref name=\"Steele\" /><ref name=\"Hammer\" />\n\nOrban, a Hungarian (though some suggest he was German), was a somewhat mysterious figure.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|374}} His cannon was named \"[[Basilic (cannon)|Basilica]]\" and was {{convert|27|ft|m}} long, and able to hurl a 600&nbsp;lb (272&nbsp;kg) stone ball over a mile (1.6&nbsp;km).<ref name=\"q6rsq\" /> The founder initially tried to sell his services to the Byzantines, who were unable to secure the funds needed to hire him. Orban then left Constantinople and approached Mehmed II, claiming that his weapon could blast 'the walls of [[Babylon]] itself'. Given abundant funds and materials, the Hungarian engineer built the gun within three months at [[Edirne]], from which it was dragged by sixty oxen to Constantinople.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|77\u201378}}  This was the only cannon that Orban built for the Ottoman forces at Constantinople.<ref name=\"Steele\" /><ref name=\"Hammer\" /> Orban's cannon had several drawbacks: it took three hours to reload; cannonballs were in very short supply; and the cannon is said to have collapsed under its own recoil after six weeks. The account of the cannon's collapse is disputed,<ref name=\"pertusicadvol1\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}} given that it was only reported in the letter of Archbishop Leonardo di Chio<ref name=\"LeonardoChio\" /> and in the later, and often unreliable, Russian chronicle of [[Nestor Iskander]].{{NoteTag|Another expert who was employed by the Ottomans was [[Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli]], also known as Ciriaco of [[Ancona]], a traveler and collector of antiquities.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}}}\n\n[[File:Conquest_of_Constantinople,_Zonaro.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Modern painting of Mehmed and the Ottoman Army approaching Constantinople with a giant bombard, by [[Fausto Zonaro]].]]\n\nHaving previously established a large foundry about {{convert|150|mi|km}} away, Mehmed now had to undertake the painstaking process of transporting his massive artillery pieces. Orban's giant cannon was said to have been accompanied by a crew of 60 oxen and over 400 men.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|374}} There was another large bombard, independently built by Turkish engineer Saruca, that was also used in the battle.<ref name=\"Steele\" /><ref name=\"Hammer\" />\n\nIn preparation for the final assault, Mehmed had an artillery train of seventy large pieces dragged from his headquarters at Edirne, in addition to the bombards cast on the spot.<ref name=\"n61Q6\" />\n\nMehmed planned to attack the Theodosian Walls, the intricate series of walls and ditches protecting Constantinople from an attack from the West, the only part of the city not surrounded by water. His army encamped outside the city on the Monday after [[Easter]], 2 April 1453.\n\nThe bulk of the Ottoman army were encamped south of the Golden Horn. The regular European troops, stretched out along the entire length of the walls, were commanded by Karadja Pasha. The regular troops from [[Anatolia]] under Ishak Pasha were stationed south of the Lycus down to the Sea of Marmara. Mehmed himself erected his red-and-gold tent near the ''Mesoteichion'', where the guns and the elite regiments, the Janissaries, were positioned. The [[Bashi-bazouk]]s were spread out behind the front lines. Other troops under [[Zagan Pasha]] were employed north of the Golden Horn. Communication was maintained by a road that had been constructed over the marshy head of the Horn.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|94\u201395}}\n\n====Byzantine dispositions and strategies====\n[[File:Fall-of-constantinople-22.jpg|thumb|Painting of the Fall of Constantinople, by [[Theophilos Hatzimihail]]]]\n\nThe city had about 20&nbsp;km of walls ([[Theodosian Walls|land walls]]: 5.5&nbsp;km; sea walls along the Golden Horn: 7&nbsp;km; sea walls along the Sea of Marmara: 7.5&nbsp;km), one of the strongest sets of fortified walls in existence. The walls had recently been repaired (under [[John VIII Palaiologos|John VIII]]) and were in fairly good shape, giving the defenders sufficient reason to believe that they could hold out until help from the West arrived.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|39}} In addition, the defenders were relatively well-equipped with a fleet of 26 ships: 5 from [[Genoa]], 5 from [[Venice]], 3 from Venetian [[Crete]], 1 from [[Ancona]], 1 from [[Aragon]], 1 from France, and about 10 Byzantine.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|45}}\n\nOn 5 April, the Sultan himself arrived with his last troops, and the defenders took up their positions. As their numbers were insufficient to occupy the walls in their entirety, it had been decided that only the outer walls would be manned. Constantine and his Greek troops guarded the ''Mesoteichion'', the middle section of the land walls, where they were crossed by the river Lycus. This section was considered the weakest spot in the walls and an attack was feared here most. Giustiniani was stationed to the north of the emperor, at the [[Walls of Constantinople#Gate of Charisius|Charisian Gate]] (''Myriandrion''); later during the siege, he was shifted to the ''Mesoteichion'' to join Constantine, leaving the ''Myriandrion'' to the charge of the Bocchiardi brothers. Minotto and his Venetians were stationed in the Blachernae palace, together with Teodoro Caristo, the Langasco brothers, and Archbishop Leonardo of Chios.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|92}}\n\nTo the left of the emperor, further south, were the commanders Cataneo, with Genoese troops, and Theophilus Palaeologus, who guarded the [[Walls of Constantinople#Gate of the Spring|Pegae Gate]] with Greek soldiers. The section of the land walls from the Pegae Gate to the Golden Gate (itself guarded by a Genoese called Manuel) was defended by the Venetian Filippo Contarini, while Demetrius Cantacuzenus had taken position on the southernmost part of the Theodosian wall.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|92}}\n\nThe sea walls were manned more sparsely, with Jacobo Contarini at [[Stoudion]], a makeshift defence force of Greek monks to his left hand, and prince Orhan at the Harbour of Eleutherius. Pere Juli\u00e0 was stationed at the Great Palace with Genoese and Catalan troops; Cardinal Isidore of Kiev guarded the tip of the peninsula near the boom.

[[Zagan Pasha]] argued against Halil Pasha, and insisted on an immediate attack. Mehmed planned to overpower the walls by sheer force, expecting that the weakened Byzantine defence by the prolonged siege would now be worn out before he ran out of troops and started preparations for a final all-out offensive.\n\n===Final assault===\n[[File:Theofilos Palaiologos.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Painting by the Greek folk painter [[Theophilos Hatzimihail]] showing the battle inside the city, Constantine is visible on a white horse]]\n\nPreparations for the final assault were started in the evening of 26 May and continued to the next day.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|378}} For 36 hours after the war council decision to attack, the Ottomans extensively mobilized their manpower in order to prepare for the general offensive.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|378}} Prayer and resting would be then granted to the soldiers on the 28th, and then the final assault would be launched.

The Christian troops of the Ottoman Empire attacked first, followed by the successive waves of the irregular [[azap]]s, who were poorly trained and equipped, and [[Anatolia]]ns who focused on a section of the [[Blachernae]] walls in the north-west part of the city, which had been damaged by the cannon. This section of the walls had been built earlier, in the eleventh century, and was much weaker. The [[Anatolians]] managed to breach this section of walls and entered the city but were just as quickly pushed back by the defenders. Finally, as the battle was continuing, the last wave, consisting of elite Janissaries, attacked the city walls.

The defenders were also being overwhelmed at several points in Constantine's section. When Turkish flags were seen flying above a small postern gate, the Kerkoporta, which was left open, panic ensued, and the defence collapsed, as Janissary soldiers, led by [[Ulubatl\u0131 Hasan]] pressed forward. Many Greek soldiers ran back home to protect their families, the Venetians ran over to their ships, and a few of the Genoese got over to Galata. The rest committed suicide by jumping off the city walls or surrendered.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}} The Greek houses nearest to the walls were the first to suffer from the Ottomans. It is said that Constantine, throwing aside his purple regalia, led the final charge against the incoming Ottomans, perishing in the ensuing battle in the streets just like his soldiers. On the other hand, Nicol\u00f2 Barbaro, a Venetian eyewitness to the siege, wrote in his diary that it was said that Constantine hanged himself at the moment when the Turks broke in at the San Romano gate, although his ultimate fate remains unknown.{{NoteTag|Barbaro added the description of the emperor's heroic last moments to his diary based on information he received afterward.

Mehmed II had sent an advance guard to protect key buildings such as the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].\n\nA small few lucky civilians managed to escape. When the Venetians retreated over to their ships, the Ottomans had already taken the walls of the Golden Horn. Luckily for the occupants of the city, the Ottomans were not interested in killing potentially valuable slaves, but rather in the loot they could get from raiding the city's houses, so they decided to attack the city instead. The Venetian captain ordered his men to break open the gate of the Golden Horn. Having done so, the Venetians left in ships filled with soldiers and refugees. Shortly after the Venetians left, a few Genoese ships and even the Emperor's ships followed them out of the Golden Horn. This fleet narrowly escaped prior to the Ottoman navy assuming control over the Golden Horn, which was accomplished by midday.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}\nThe Army converged upon the [[Augusteum]], the vast square that fronted the great church of Hagia Sophia whose bronze gates were barred by a huge throng of civilians inside the building, hoping for divine protection.

The Christian re-conquest of Constantinople remained a goal in Western Europe for many years after its fall to the [[House of Osman]].  Rumours of Constantine XI's survival and subsequent rescue by an angel led many to hope that the city would one day return to Christian hands. [[Pope Nicholas V]] called for an immediate counter-attack in the form of a crusade.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} When no European monarch was willing to lead the crusade, the Pope himself decided to go, but his early death stopped this plan.

In its own time, the Empire ruled from Constantinople (or \"New Rome\" as some people call it, although this was a laudatory expression that was never an official title) was considered simply as \"the Roman Empire.\" The fall of Constantinople led competing factions to lay claim to being the inheritors of the Imperial mantle. Russian claims to Byzantine heritage clashed with those of the Ottoman Empire's own claim. In Mehmed's view, he was the successor to the [[Roman Emperor]], declaring himself ''Kayser-i Rum'', literally \"[[Caesar (title)|Caesar of Rome]]\", that is, of the Roman Empire, though he was remembered as \"the Conqueror\".  He founded a political system that survived until 1922 with the establishment of the [[Republic of Turkey]].\n\n[[Stefan Du\u0161an]], Tsar of [[Serbian Empire|Serbia]], and [[Ivan Alexander]], Tsar of [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], both made similar claims, regarding themselves as legitimate heirs to the Roman Empire.

[[Avvakum]] and other \"[[Old Believers]]\" saw these reforms as a [[corruption (philosophical concept)|corruption]] of the Russian Church, which they considered to be the \"true\" Church of God. As the other Churches were more closely related to Constantinople in their liturgies, Avvakum argued that Constantinople fell to the Turks because of these [[heresy|heretical]] beliefs and practices.\n\nThe fall of Constantinople has a profound impact on the ancient [[Pentarchy]] of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|the Orthodox Church]]. Today, the four ancient sees of Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, and Constantinople are almost completely devoid of followers and believers{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} because of Islamization and the ''[[Dhimma]]'' system to which Christians have been subjected since the earliest days of Islam.

However, Istanbul only became the official name of the city in 1930 by the revised Turkish Postal Law as part of [[Atat\u00fcrk]]'s reforms.<ref name=\"ZooPt\" /><ref name=\"DwbQb\" /><ref name=\"YEruk\" />\n\n===In historical fiction===\n* [[Lew Wallace]], ''The Prince of India; or, Why Constantinople Fell''.

{{lang-tr|{{italics correction|\u0130stanbul'un Fethi}}|lit= '''Conquest of Istanbul'''}}) was the capture of the [[capital city]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] by an invading [[Ottoman army]] on 29 May 1453. The attackers were commanded by the 21-year-old [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]] [[Mehmed II]], who defeated an army commanded by [[Byzantine Emperor|Emperor]] [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] and took control of the imperial capital, ending a 53-day siege that had begun on 6 April 1453. After conquering the city, Sultan Mehmed transferred the capital of the Ottoman State from [[Edirne|Adrianople]] to Constantinople and established his court there.\n\nThe capture of the city (and two other Byzantine splinter territories soon thereafter) marked the end of the [[Roman Empire]], a state which dated to 27 BC, which had lasted for nearly 1,500 years.<ref name=\"ms97\" /> The conquest of Constantinople also dealt a massive blow to the defence of mainland Europe, as the Muslim Ottoman armies thereafter were left unchecked to advance into Europe without an adversary to their rear.\n\nIt was also a watershed moment in military history. Since ancient times, cities had used ramparts and city walls to protect themselves from invaders, and Constantinople's substantial fortifications had been a model followed by cities throughout the Mediterranean region and Europe. The Ottomans ultimately prevailed due to the use of [[gunpowder]] (which powered formidable cannons).<ref name=\"econfallmill\" />\n\nThe conquest of the city of Constantinople and the end of the Byzantine Empire<ref name=\"ealoipolis\" /> was a key event in the [[Late Middle Ages]] which also marks, for some historians, the end of the Medieval period.<ref name=\"GpAG8\" />\n\n==State of the Byzantine Empire==\n[[Constantinople]] had been an imperial capital since its consecration in 330 under Roman emperor [[Constantine the Great]]. In the following eleven centuries, the city had been [[List of sieges of Constantinople|besieged many times]] but was captured only once: during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|304}} The crusaders established an unstable [[Latin Empire|Latin state]] in and around Constantinople while the remaining empire splintered into a number of Byzantine successor states, notably [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] and [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]]. They fought as allies against the Latin establishments, but also fought among themselves for the Byzantine throne.\n\nThe Nicaeans eventually reconquered Constantinople from the Latins in 1261, reestablishing the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty. Thereafter, there was little peace for the much-weakened empire as it fended off successive attacks by the Latins, the [[Serbia]]ns, the [[Bulgaria]]ns, and, most importantly, the [[Ottoman Turks]].<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" /><ref name=\"O2kxx\" /><ref name=\"ospbyzwar6001453\" /><ref name=\"oxhistbyzmango\" /> The [[Black Plague]] between 1346 and 1349 killed almost half of the inhabitants of Constantinople.<ref name=\"rCeS6\" /> The city was further depopulated by the general economic and territorial decline of the empire, and by 1453 consisted of a series of walled villages separated by vast fields encircled by the fifth-century [[Theodosian Walls]].\n\nBy 1450 the empire was exhausted and had shrunk to a few square kilometres outside the city of Constantinople itself, the [[Princes' Islands]] in the [[Sea of Marmara]], and the [[Peloponnese]] with its cultural centre at [[Mystras]]. The [[Empire of Trebizond]], an independent [[successor state]] that formed in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, also survived on the coast of the [[Black Sea]].\n\n==Preparations==\nWhen Sultan [[Mehmed II]] succeeded his father in 1451, he was just nineteen years old.  Many European courts assumed that the young Ottoman ruler would not seriously challenge Christian hegemony in the [[Balkans]] and the Aegean.<ref name=\"nbpyu\" /> This calculation was boosted by Mehmed's friendly overtures to the European envoys at his new court.<ref name=\"cJRwI\" /> But Mehmed's mild words were not matched by actions. By early 1452, work began on the construction of a second [[fortress]] (''[[Rumelihisar\u0131|Rumeli hisar\u0131]]'') on the [[Bosphorus]],<ref name=\"WDL\" /> on the European side several miles north of Constantinople, set directly across the strait on the Asian side from the ''[[Anadoluhisar\u0131|Anadolu Hisar\u0131]]'' fortress, built by his great-grandfather [[Bayezid I]]. This pair of fortresses ensured complete control of sea traffic on the Bosphorus;<ref name=\"MBVR8\" /> and defended against attack by the [[Genoa|Genoese]] colonies on the Black Sea coast to the north. (This new fortress, was called  ''Bo\u011fazkesen'', which means 'strait-blocker' or 'throat-cutter', to emphasize its strategic position.) In October 1452, Mehmed ordered [[Turakhan Beg]] to station a large garrison force in the [[Peloponnese]] to block [[Thomas Palaiologos|Thomas]] and [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]] ([[despotes]] in Southern Greece) from providing aid to their brother [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] during the impending siege of Constantinople.{{NoteTag|While Mehmed II had been steadily preparing for the siege of Constantinople, he had sent the old general Turakhan and the latter's two sons, Ahmed Beg and Omar Beg, to invade the [[Morea]] and to remain there all winter also to prevent the despots Thomas and Demetrius from giving aid to Constantine XI.<ref name=\"setpapacylevant\" />{{rp|146}}}}  [[Michael Critobulus]] quotes the speech of Mehmed II to his soldiers: \"My friends and men of my empire! You all know very well that our forefathers secured this kingdom that we now hold at the cost of many struggles and very great dangers and that, having passed it along in succession from their fathers, from father to son, they handed it down to me. For some of the oldest of you were sharers in many of the exploits carried through by them\u2014those at least of you who are of maturer years\u2014and the younger of you have heard of these deeds from your fathers. They are not such very ancient events nor of such a sort as to be forgotten through the lapse of time. Still, the eyewitness of those who have seen testifies better than does the hearing of deeds that happened but yesterday or the day before.\"\n\n===European support===\n[[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine XI]] swiftly understood Mehmed's true intentions and turned to [[Western Europe]] for help; but now the price of centuries of war and enmity between the [[Eastern Christianity|eastern]] and [[Western Christianity|western churches]] had to be paid. Since the [[East\u2013West Schism|mutual excommunications]] of 1054, the [[pope]] in Rome was committed to establishing authority over [[Eastern Orthodox Church|the eastern church]]. The Union was agreed by the Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] in 1274, at the [[Second Council of Lyon]], and indeed, some Palaiologoi emperors (Latin, Palaeologan) had since been received into the [[Latin Church]]. Emperor [[John VIII Palaiologos]] had also recently negotiated union with [[Pope Eugene IV]], with the [[Council of Florence#Eugene IV's eastern strategy|Council of Florence]] of 1439 proclaiming a ''Bull of Union''. The imperial efforts to impose union were met with strong resistance in Constantinople. A propaganda initiative was stimulated by anti-unionist [[Greek Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] partisans in Constantinople; the population, as well as the laity and leadership of the Byzantine Church, became bitterly divided. Latent [[ethnic hatred]] between Greeks and Italians, stemming from the events of the [[Massacre of the Latins]] in 1182 by the Greeks and the [[Fourth Crusade|sack of Constantinople]] in 1204 by the Latins, played a significant role. Ultimately, the attempted Union failed, greatly annoying [[Pope Nicholas V]] and the hierarchy of the Roman church.\n\n[[File:Eastern Mediterranean 1450 .svg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The Byzantine Empire in the first half of the 15th&nbsp;century.

Although some troops did arrive from the mercantile city-states in the north of Italy, the Western contribution was not adequate to counterbalance Ottoman strength. Some Western individuals, however, came to help defend the city on their own account. Cardinal Isidore, funded by the pope, arrived in 1452 with 200 archers.<ref name=\"qGd6u\" /> An accomplished soldier from [[Genoa]], [[Giovanni Giustiniani]],  arrived with 400 men from Genoa and 300 men from Genoese Chios, in January 1453.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|83\u201384}} As a specialist in defending walled cities, he was immediately given the overall command of the defence of the land walls by the emperor.

This chain, which floated on logs, was strong enough to prevent any Turkish ship from entering the harbour. This device was one of two that gave the Byzantines some hope of extending the siege until the possible arrival of foreign help.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{rp|380}} This strategy was enforced because in 1204 the armies of the Fourth Crusade successfully circumvented Constantinople's land defences by breaching the Golden Horn Wall. Another strategy employed by the Byzantines was the repair and fortification of the Land Wall (Theodosian Walls). Emperor Constantine deemed it necessary to ensure that the [[Blachernae]] district's wall was the most fortified because that section of the wall protruded northwards.

The regular European troops, stretched out along the entire length of the walls, were commanded by Karadja Pasha. The regular troops from [[Anatolia]] under Ishak Pasha were stationed south of the Lycus down to the Sea of Marmara. Mehmed himself erected his red-and-gold tent near the ''Mesoteichion'', where the guns and the elite regiments, the Janissaries, were positioned. The [[Bashi-bazouk]]s were spread out behind the front lines. Other troops under [[Zagan Pasha]] were employed north of the Golden Horn.

As their numbers were insufficient to occupy the walls in their entirety, it had been decided that only the outer walls would be manned. Constantine and his Greek troops guarded the ''Mesoteichion'', the middle section of the land walls, where they were crossed by the river Lycus. This section was considered the weakest spot in the walls and an attack was feared here most. Giustiniani was stationed to the north of the emperor, at the [[Walls of Constantinople#Gate of Charisius|Charisian Gate]] (''Myriandrion''); later during the siege, he was shifted to the ''Mesoteichion'' to join Constantine, leaving the ''Myriandrion'' to the charge of the Bocchiardi brothers.

The section of the land walls from the Pegae Gate to the Golden Gate (itself guarded by a Genoese called Manuel) was defended by the Venetian Filippo Contarini, while Demetrius Cantacuzenus had taken position on the southernmost part of the Theodosian wall.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|92}}\n\nThe sea walls were manned more sparsely, with Jacobo Contarini at [[Stoudion]], a makeshift defence force of Greek monks to his left hand, and prince Orhan at the Harbour of Eleutherius. Pere Juli\u00e0 was stationed at the Great Palace with Genoese and Catalan troops; Cardinal Isidore of Kiev guarded the tip of the peninsula near the boom. The sea walls at the southern shore of the [[Golden Horn]] were defended by Venetian and Genoese sailors under [[Gabriele Trevisano]].<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|93}}\n\nTwo tactical reserves were kept behind in the city, one in the Petra district just behind the land walls and one near the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], under the command of [[Loukas Notaras]] and Nicephorus Palaeologus, respectively. The Venetian Alviso Diedo commanded the ships in the harbour.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|94}}\n\nAlthough the Byzantines also had cannons, they were much smaller than those of the Ottomans and the [[recoil]] tended to damage their own walls.<ref name=\"LeonardoChio\" />\n\nAccording to [[David Nicolle]], despite many odds, the idea that Constantinople was inevitably doomed is wrong, and the overall situation was not as one-sided as a simple glance at a map might suggest.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|40}} It has also been claimed that Constantinople was \"the best-defended city in Europe\" at that time.<ref name=\"bZgqW\" />\n\n==Siege==\nAt the beginning of the siege, Mehmed sent out some of his best troops to reduce the remaining Byzantine strongholds outside the city of Constantinople. The fortress of Therapia on the Bosphorus and a smaller castle at the village of Studius near the Sea of Marmara were taken within a few days.

Although one of the fleet's main tasks was to prevent any ships from outside from entering the Golden Horn, on 20 April a small flotilla of four Christian ships{{NoteTag|These were the three Genoese ships sent by the Pope, joined by a large Imperial transport ship which had been sent on a foraging mission to Sicily previous to the siege and was on its way back to Constantinople.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|100}}}} managed to slip in after some heavy fighting, an event which strengthened the morale of the defenders and caused embarrassment to the Sultan.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|376}} Baltoghlu's life was spared after his subordinates testified to his bravery during the conflict.\n\nMehmed ordered the construction of a road of greased logs across [[Galata]] on the north side of the Golden Horn, and dragged his ships over the hill, directly into the Golden Horn on 22 April, bypassing the chain barrier.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|376}} This seriously threatened the flow of supplies from Genoese ships from the\u2014nominally neutral\u2014colony of [[Beyo\u011flu|Pera]], and demoralized the Byzantine defenders. On the night of 28 April, an attempt was made to destroy the Ottoman ships already in the Golden Horn using [[fire ship]]s, but the Ottomans forced the Christians to retreat with heavy losses. Forty Italians escaped their sinking ships and swam to the northern shore.  On orders of Mehmed, they were [[Impalement|impaled]] on stakes, in sight of the city's defenders on the sea walls across the Golden Horn. In retaliation, the defenders brought their Ottoman prisoners, 260 in all, to the walls, where they were executed, one by one, before the eyes of the Ottomans.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|108}}<ref name=\"MoRBA\" /> With the failure of their attack on the Ottoman vessels, the defenders were forced to disperse part of their forces to defend the sea walls along the Golden Horn.\n\nThe Ottoman army had made several frontal assaults on the land wall of Constantinople, but were always repelled with heavy losses.<ref name=\"FdrIR\" /> Venetian surgeon [[Niccol\u00f2 Barbaro]], describing in his diary one of such frequent land attacks especially by the Janissaries, wrote:\n\n{{quote|They found the Turks coming right up under the walls and seeking battle, particularly the Janissaries&nbsp;... and when one or two of them were killed, at once more Turks came and took away the dead ones&nbsp;... without caring how near they came to the city walls.

However, an engineer named [[Johannes Grant]], a German{{NoteTag|[[Steven Runciman|Runciman]] speculates that he may have been Scottish<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|84}}}} who came together with the Genoese contingent, had counter-mines dug, allowing Byzantine troops to enter the mines and kill the workers. The Byzantines intercepted the first Serbian tunnel on the night of 16 May. Subsequent tunnels were interrupted on 21, 23, and 25 May, and destroyed with [[Greek fire]] and vigorous combat. On 23 May, the Byzantines captured and [[torture]]d two Turkish officers, who revealed the location of all the Turkish tunnels, which were then destroyed.<ref name=\"TQ2Lp\" />\n\nOn 21 May, Mehmed sent an ambassador to Constantinople and offered to lift the siege if they gave him the city. He promised he would allow the Emperor and any other inhabitants to leave with their possessions. Moreover, he would recognize the Emperor as governor of the Peloponnese. Lastly, he guaranteed the safety of the population that might choose to remain in the city. Constantine XI only agreed to pay higher tributes to the sultan and recognized the status of all the conquered castles and lands in the hands of the Turks as Ottoman possession.\n\n{{quote|As to surrendering the city to you, it is not for me to decide or for anyone else of its citizens; for all of us have reached the mutual decision to die of our own free will, without any regard for our lives.{{NoteTag|Original text: \u03a4\u1f78 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd \u03c3\u03bf\u1fd6 \u03b4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf\u1f54\u03c4' \u1f10\u03bc\u1f78\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03bd \u03bf\u1f54\u03c4' \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u1fc3\u2022 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u1fc7 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03bc\u1fc3 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03ad\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bf\u1f50 \u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03b8\u03b1 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b6\u03c9\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd.<ref name=\"29maiouiefemerida\" />}}}}\n\nAround this time, Mehmed had a final council with his senior officers.

According to some Ottoman sources Constantine was killed in an accidental encounter with Turkish marines a little further to the south, presumably while making his way to the Sea of Marmara in order to escape by sea.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}}}\n\nAfter the initial assault, the Ottoman Army fanned out along the main thoroughfare of the city, the Mese, past the great forums, and past the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], which Mehmed II wanted to provide a seat for his newly appointed patriarch which would help him better control his Christian subjects. Mehmed II had sent an advance guard to protect key buildings such as the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].\n\nA small few lucky civilians managed to escape. When the Venetians retreated over to their ships, the Ottomans had already taken the walls of the Golden Horn. Luckily for the occupants of the city, the Ottomans were not interested in killing potentially valuable slaves, but rather in the loot they could get from raiding the city's houses, so they decided to attack the city instead. The Venetian captain ordered his men to break open the gate of the Golden Horn. Having done so, the Venetians left in ships filled with soldiers and refugees. Shortly after the Venetians left, a few Genoese ships and even the Emperor's ships followed them out of the Golden Horn. This fleet narrowly escaped prior to the Ottoman navy assuming control over the Golden Horn, which was accomplished by midday.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}\nThe Army converged upon the [[Augusteum]], the vast square that fronted the great church of Hagia Sophia whose bronze gates were barred by a huge throng of civilians inside the building, hoping for divine protection. After the doors were breached, the troops separated the congregation according to what price they might bring in the slave markets.\n\nOttoman casualties are unknown but they are believed by most historians to be very heavy due to several unsuccessful Ottoman attacks made during the siege and final assault.{{cn|date=February 2020}} According to the Venetian surgeon Nicolo Barbaro \"all through the day the Turks made a great slaughter of Christians through the city\". Barbaro described blood flowing in the city \"like rainwater in the gutters after a sudden storm\", and bodies of Turks and Christians floating in the sea \"like melons along a canal\".<ref name=\"Barbaro\" />\n\n===Plundering phase===\nMehmed II granted his soldiers three days to plunder the city, as he had promised them and in accordance with the custom of the time.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|145}}<ref name=\"mCj01\" /> Soldiers fought over the possession of some of the [[War looting|spoils of war]].<ref name=\"histbyzoxon\" />{{rp|283}} Most of the Greek women were raped and enslaved<ref name=\"hRhtW\" />. According to the Venetian surgeon Nicol\u00f2 Barbaro, \"all through the day the Turks made a great slaughter of Christians through the city\". According to Philip Mansel, widespread persecution of the city's civilian inhabitants took place, resulting in thousands of murders and rapes and 30,000 civilians being enslaved or forcibly deported.<ref name=\"iK51W\" />\n\nThe looting was extremely thorough in certain parts of the city. Four days later on 2 June, the Sultan would find the city largely deserted and half in ruins; churches had been desecrated and stripped, houses were no longer habitable and stores and shops were emptied. He is famously reported to have been moved to tears by this, speaking \"What a city we have given over to plunder and destruction.\"<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|152}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n<!--Linked from infobox above-->\nOn the third day of the conquest, [[Mehmed II]] ordered all [[looting]] to stop and issued a proclamation that all Christians who had avoided capture or who had been ransomed could return to their homes without further molestation, although many had no homes to return to, and many more had been taken captive and not ransomed.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|150\u201351}} Byzantine historian [[George Sphrantzes]], an eyewitness to the fall of Constantinople, described the Sultan's actions:<ref name=\"ttHMm\" /><ref name=\"vCvPQ\" /><!-- there was a ref to p.&nbsp;133, but it is not clear which edition of which book (Sphrantzes or Kritovoulos) it referred to-->\n\n{{quote | On the third day after the fall of our city, the Sultan celebrated his victory with a great, joyful triumph. He issued a proclamation: the citizens of all ages who had managed to escape detection were to leave their hiding places throughout the city and come out into the open, as they were to remain free and no question would be asked. He further declared the restoration of houses and property to those who had abandoned our city before the siege. If they returned home, they would be treated according to their rank and religion, as if nothing had changed. | George Sphrantzes}}\n\nThe ''Hagia Sophia'' was converted into a mosque, but the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Greek Orthodox Church]] was allowed to remain intact and [[Gennadius Scholarius]] was appointed [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]]. This was once thought to be the origin of the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman ''millet'' system]]; however, it is now considered a myth and no such system existed in the fifteenth century.<ref name=\"aMn4U\" /><ref name=\"AIhgF\" />\n\n[[File:Hagia-Sophia-Laengsschnitt.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Following the city's conquest, the Church of the [[Holy Wisdom]] (the ''[[Hagia Sophia]]'') was converted into a [[mosque]].]]\n\nAfter the sack, many feared other European Christian kingdoms would suffer the same fate as Constantinople. Two possible responses emerged amongst the [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] and churchmen of that era: [[Crusade]] or dialogue. [[Pope Pius II]] strongly advocated for another Crusade, while the German [[Nicholas of Cusa]] supported engaging in a dialogue with the Ottomans.<ref name=\"NqTxI\" />\n\nThe [[Morea]]n (Peloponnesian) fortress of Mystras, where Constantine's brothers [[Thomas Palaiologos|Thomas]] and [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrius]] ruled, constantly in conflict with each other and knowing that Mehmed would eventually invade them as well, held out until 1460. Long before the fall of Constantinople, Demetrius had fought for the throne with Thomas, Constantine, and their other brothers [[John VIII Palaiologos|John]] and [[Theodore II Palaiologos, Lord of Morea|Theodore]].<ref name=\"norwichdeclinefall\" />{{rp|446}} Thomas escaped to Rome when the Ottomans invaded Morea while Demetrius expected to rule a puppet state, but instead was imprisoned and remained there for the rest of his life. In Rome, Thomas and his family received some monetary support from the Pope and other Western rulers as Byzantine emperor in exile, until 1503. In 1461 the independent Byzantine state in [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]] fell to Mehmed.<ref name=\"norwichdeclinefall\" />{{rp|446}}\n\n[[Constantine XI]] had died without producing an heir, and had Constantinople not fallen he likely would have been succeeded by the sons of his deceased elder brother, who were taken into the palace service of Mehmed after the fall of Constantinople. The oldest boy, renamed to Murad, became a personal favourite of Mehmed and served as [[Beylerbey]] (Governor-General) of [[Rumeli]] (the Balkans). The younger son, renamed [[Mesih Pasha]], became Admiral of the Ottoman fleet and Sancak Beg (Governor) of the Province of Gallipoli. He eventually served twice as Grand Vizier under Mehmed's son, [[Bayezid II]].<ref name=\"nsxzN\" />\n\nWith the capture of Constantinople, Mehmed II had acquired the \"natural\" capital of its kingdom, albeit one in decline due to years of war. The loss of the city was a crippling blow to Christendom, and it exposed the Christian west to a vigorous and aggressive foe in the east. The Christian re-conquest of Constantinople remained a goal in Western Europe for many years after its fall to the [[House of Osman]].  Rumours of Constantine XI's survival and subsequent rescue by an angel led many to hope that the city would one day return to Christian hands. [[Pope Nicholas V]] called for an immediate counter-attack in the form of a crusade.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} When no European monarch was willing to lead the crusade, the Pope himself decided to go, but his early death stopped this plan. As Western Europe entered the 16th century, the [[Crusades|age of Crusading]] began to come to an end.\n\nFor some time Greek scholars had gone to [[Italian city-states]], a cultural exchange begun in 1396 by [[Coluccio Salutati]], chancellor of Florence, who had invited [[Manuel Chrysoloras]], a Byzantine scholar to lecture at the [[University of Florence]].<ref name=\"Mw3eQ\" /> After the conquest many Greeks, such as [[John Argyropoulos]] and [[Constantine Lascaris]], fled the city and found refuge in the Latin West, [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|bringing with them knowledge and documents from the Greco-Roman tradition to Italy]] and other regions that further propelled the [[Renaissance]].<ref name=\"J2i2B\" /><ref name=\"Byzantines in Renaissance Italy\" /> Those Greeks who stayed behind in Constantinople mostly lived in the [[Phanar]] and [[Galata]] districts of the city. The [[Phanariotes]], as they were called, provided many capable advisers to the Ottoman rulers.\n\n===Third Rome===\n{{Main|Third Rome}}\n\n[[File:Gentile Bellini 003.jpg|thumb|''Sultan Mehmed II the Conqueror'', by [[Gentile Bellini]]]]\n\n[[Byzantium]] is a term used by modern historians to refer to the later Roman Empire. In its own time, the Empire ruled from Constantinople (or \"New Rome\" as some people call it, although this was a laudatory expression that was never an official title) was considered simply as \"the Roman Empire.\" The fall of Constantinople led competing factions to lay claim to being the inheritors of the Imperial mantle. Russian claims to Byzantine heritage clashed with those of the Ottoman Empire's own claim. In Mehmed's view, he was the successor to the [[Roman Emperor]], declaring himself ''Kayser-i Rum'', literally \"[[Caesar (title)|Caesar of Rome]]\", that is, of the Roman Empire, though he was remembered as \"the Conqueror\".  He founded a political system that survived until 1922 with the establishment of the [[Republic of Turkey]].\n\n[[Stefan Du\u0161an]], Tsar of [[Serbian Empire|Serbia]], and [[Ivan Alexander]], Tsar of [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], both made similar claims, regarding themselves as legitimate heirs to the Roman Empire. Other potential claimants, such as the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] have disintegrated into history.<ref name=\"W8pk7\" />\n\n===Impact on the Churches===\nIn 17th-century Russia, the fall of Constantinople had a role in the fierce theological and political controversy between adherents and opponents of the [[Raskol|reforms]] in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] carried out by [[Patriarch Nikon]], which he intended to bring the Russian Church closer to the norms and practices of other Orthodox churches. [[Avvakum]] and other \"[[Old Believers]]\" saw these reforms as a [[corruption (philosophical concept)|corruption]] of the Russian Church, which they considered to be the \"true\" Church of God. As the other Churches were more closely related to Constantinople in their liturgies, Avvakum argued that Constantinople fell to the Turks because of these [[heresy|heretical]] beliefs and practices.\n\nThe fall of Constantinople has a profound impact on the ancient [[Pentarchy]] of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|the Orthodox Church]]. Today, the four ancient sees of Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, and Constantinople are almost completely devoid of followers and believers{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} because of Islamization and the ''[[Dhimma]]'' system to which Christians have been subjected since the earliest days of Islam. As a result of this process, the centre of authority in the Orthodox Church changed and migrated to Eastern Europe (e.g., [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]]) rather than remaining in the former Byzantine Near East.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Cultural references==\n===Legends===\nThere are many legends in Greece surrounding the Fall of Constantinople. It was said that [[May 1453 lunar eclipse|the partial lunar eclipse]] that occurred on 22 May 1453 represented a fulfilment of a prophecy of the city's demise.<ref name=\"L0Kni\" /> Four days later, the whole city was blotted out by a thick [[fog]], a condition unknown in that part of the world in May. When the fog lifted that evening, a strange light was seen playing about the dome of the Hagia Sophia, which some interpreted as the [[Holy Spirit]] departing from the city. \"This evidently indicated the departure of the Divine Presence, and its leaving the City in total abandonment and desertion, for the Divinity conceals itself in cloud and appears and again disappears.\"<ref name=\"OBWWf\" /> For others, there was still a distant hope that the lights were the campfires of the troops of [[John Hunyadi]] who had come to relieve the city.{{NoteTag|It is possible that all these phenomena were local effects of the cataclysmic [[Kuwae]] volcanic eruption in the Pacific Ocean. The \"fire\" seen may have been an optical illusion due to the reflection of intensely red twilight glow by clouds of volcanic ash high in the atmosphere.<ref name=\"nasakuwae\" />}}\n\nAnother legend holds that two priests saying [[divine liturgy]] over the crowd disappeared into the cathedral's walls as the first Turkish soldiers entered. According to the legend, the priests will appear again on the day that Constantinople returns to Christian hands.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|147}} Another legend refers to the ''Marble King'' (Constantine XI), holding that an angel rescued the emperor when the Ottomans entered the city, turning him into marble and placing him in a cave under the earth near the Golden Gate, where he waits to be brought to life again (a variant of the [[sleeping hero]] legend).<ref name=\"3otvo\" /><ref name=\"hatzfallhec\" />\n\n===Cultural impact===\n[[Guillaume Dufay]] composed several songs lamenting the fall of the Eastern church, and the duke of Burgundy, [[Philip the Good]], [[Feast of the Pheasant|avowed]] to take up arms against the Turks. However, as the growing Ottoman power from this date on coincided with the [[Protestant Reformation]] and subsequent [[Counter-Reformation]], the recapture of Constantinople became an ever-distant dream. Even France, once a fervent participant in the Crusades, became an ally of the Ottomans.\n\nNonetheless, depictions of Christian coalitions taking the city and of the late Emperor's resurrection by [[Leo the Wise]] persisted.<ref name=\"oxhistbyzmango\" />{{rp|280}}\n\n29 May 1453, the day of the fall of Constantinople, fell on a Tuesday, and since then Tuesday has been considered an unlucky day by Greeks generally.<ref name=\"QMrK6\" />\n\n===Impact on the Renaissance===\n{{Main|Greek scholars in the Renaissance}}\nThe migration waves of [[Byzantine]] scholars and \u00e9migr\u00e9s in the period following the [[Siege of Constantinople|sacking of Constantinople]] and the fall of Constantinople in 1453 is considered by many scholars key to the revival of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] studies that led to the development of the [[Renaissance humanism]]<ref name=\"Byzantines in Renaissance Italy\" />{{dead link|date=November 2016}}{{better source|reason=Tall claim requires high-quality academic citation, not a website|date=November 2016}} and [[History of science in the Renaissance|science]].

''Islambol'' ({{lang|ota| \u0627\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0628\u0648\u0644}}, ''Full of Islam'') or ''Islambul'' (''find Islam'') or ''Islam(b)ol'' (''old [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]: be Islam''), both in Turkish Language, were [[folk etymology|folk-etymological]] adaptations of ''Istanbul'' created after the Ottoman conquest of 1453 to express the city's new role as the capital of the Islamic Ottoman Empire. It is first attested shortly after the conquest, and its invention was ascribed by some contemporary writers to Sultan [[Mehmed II]] himself.<ref name=\"istanbulunadlari\" />\n\nThe [[Names of Istanbul|name of Istanbul]] is thought to be derived from the Greek phrase ''\u012bs t\u012bmbol\u012b(n)'' ({{lang-el|\u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd}}, [[transliteration|translit.]] ''eis t\u0113n p\u00f3lin'', \"to the City\"), and it is claimed that it had already spread among the Turkish populace of the Ottoman Empire before the conquest.

{"title_page": "History of NATO", "text_new": "This article outlines the '''history of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]]''' ('''NATO''').  British diplomacy set the stage for [[NATO]] to contain the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) and stop the expansion of [[Communism]] in Europe. Britain and France in 1947 signed the [[Treaty of Dunkirk]], a defensive pact. This expanded in 1948 with the [[Treaty of Brussels]] to add the three [[Benelux]] (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) countries. It committed them to collective defence against any armed attack for fifty years.  The British worked with Washington to expand the alliance into NATO in 1949, adding the U.S. and Canada as well as   Italy, Portugal, Norway, Denmark and Iceland.<ref>Cees Wiebes and Bert Zeeman, \"The Pentagon Negotiations March 1948: The Launching of the North Atlantic Treaty.\" ''International Affairs'' 59.3 (1983): 351-363.</ref>  West Germany and Spain joined later.\n\n== Beginnings ==\n{{Main|Western Union (alliance)|North Atlantic Treaty}}\n[[File:Truman signing North Atlantic Treaty.jpg|thumb|The North Atlantic Treaty was signed by US President Harry S. Truman in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], on 4 April 1949 and was ratified by the United States in August 1949.|alt=Eleven men in suits stand around a large desk at which another man is signing a document.]]\n\nThe [[Treaty of Brussels]] was a mutual defence treaty against the Soviet threat at the start of the Cold War. It was signed on 17 March 1948 by Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom. It was the precursor to NATO. The Soviet threat became immediate with the [[Berlin Blockade]] in 1948, leading to the creation of a multinational defence organization, the [[Western Union Defence Organisation]], in September 1948.{{sfn|Isby|Kamps Jr.|1985|p=13}} However, the parties were too weak militarily to counter the [[Soviet Armed Forces]]. In addition, the [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'\u00e9tat]] by the Communists had overthrown a democratic government and British Foreign Minister [[Ernest Bevin]] reiterated that the best way to prevent another Czechoslovakia was to evolve a joint Western military strategy. He got a receptive hearing in the United States, especially considering American anxiety over Italy (and the [[Italian Communist Party]]).{{sfn|Pedaliu|2003|p=97}}\n\nIn 1948, European leaders met with US defence, military and diplomatic officials at the Pentagon, exploring a framework for a new and unprecedented association.<ref>Cees Wiebes and Bert Zeeman, \"The Pentagon Negotiations March 1948: The Launching of the North Atlantic Treaty.\" International Affairs 59.3 (1983): 351-363.</ref> The talks resulted in the [[North Atlantic Treaty]], The U.S. signed on 4 April 1949.

The creation of NATO can be seen as the primary institutional consequence of a school of thought called [[Atlanticism]] which stressed the importance of trans-Atlantic cooperation.<ref name=Straus>{{cite journal |last=Straus |first=Ira |title=Atlanticism as the Core 20th Century US Strategy for Internationalism |journal=Streit Council |date=June 2005 |series=Annual Meeting of the Society of Historians of American Foreign Relations |url=http://streitcouncil.org/uploads/PDF/Straus-%20Atlanticism%20as%20the%20core%2020th%20century%20US%20Strategy%20for%20internationalism.pdf |accessdate=10 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:NATO 3c 1952 issue U.S. stamp.jpg|thumb|left|A 1952 US [[postage stamp]] commemorating the third anniversary of NATO.

Consequently, they agreed that, if an armed attack occurred, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence, would assist the member being attacked, taking such action as it deemed necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. The treaty does not require members to respond with military action against an aggressor. Although obliged to respond, they maintain the freedom to choose the method by which they do so. This differs from Article&nbsp;IV of the Treaty of Brussels, which clearly states that the response will be military in nature. It is nonetheless assumed that NATO members will aid the attacked member militarily. The treaty was later clarified to include both the member's territory and their \"vessels, forces or aircraft\" above the [[Tropic of Cancer]], including some [[overseas department]]s of France.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17245.htm |title= Protocol to the North Atlantic Treaty on the Accession of Greece and Turkey |publisher= NATO |date= 4 April 1949 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe creation of NATO brought about some [[standardization]] of allied [[military terminology]], procedures, and technology, which in many cases meant European countries adopting US practices. The roughly 1300&nbsp;[[Standardization Agreement]]s (STANAG) codified many of the common practices that NATO has achieved. Hence, the [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] rifle cartridge was introduced in the 1950s as a standard firearm cartridge among many NATO countries.<ref>{{web cite|url=http://archives.nato.int/proof-and-inspection-committee-nato-7-62-mm-ammunition;isad|title=Proof and Inspection Committee NATO 7.62 MM Ammunition|publisher=NATO}}</ref> [[Fabrique Nationale de Herstal]]'s [[FN FAL|FAL]], which used the 7.62mm NATO cartridge, was adopted by 75 countries, including many outside of NATO.{{sfn|Willbanks|2004|pp=129\u2013130}} Also, [[aircraft marshalling|aircraft marshalling signals]] were standardized, so that any NATO aircraft could land at any NATO base.

Thus the Secretariat provides secretaries to all the Council's principal committees and working groups - apart from those of a strictly technical nature - and ensures co-ordination between them. .. On the Staff side there are three main divisions corresponding to the three principal aspects of NATO's work, each under an Assistant Secretary General. Ambassador Sergio Fenoaltea (Italy) heads the Political Affairs Division, M. Rene Sergent (France) the Economics and Finance Division, and Mr. Lowell P. Weicker (USA) the Production and Logistics Division. The Divisions' tasks are to prepare, in close touch with delegations, proposed action in their respective fields for consideration by the appropriate committee or by the Council. In addition to the main divisions there are three other offices working directly to the Secretary General. These are the Office of Statistics (Mr. Loring Wood of the USA), the Financial Comptroller's Office (M. A. J. Bastin of Belgium), and the Division of Information (Mr. Geoffrey Parsons, Jr. of the USA). The Information Division, besides providing material about NATO for the use of member governments, (it does not engage in independent operations), is also the press and public relations branch of the civilian authority.</blockquote>\n\n===Military structure===\nThe Strategic Commanders are the former 'Major NATO Commanders', who sat atop a command hierarchy consisting of Major Subordinate Commanders (MSCs), Principal Subordinate Commanders (PSCs) and Sub-PSCs.<ref>T.D.

This expanded in 1948 with the [[Treaty of Brussels]] to add the three [[Benelux]] (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) countries. It committed them to collective defence against any armed attack for fifty years.  The British worked with Washington to expand the alliance into NATO in 1949, adding the U.S. and Canada as well as   Italy, Portugal, Norway, Denmark and Iceland.<ref>Cees Wiebes and Bert Zeeman, \"The Pentagon Negotiations March 1948: The Launching of the North Atlantic Treaty.\" ''International Affairs'' 59.3 (1983): 351-363.</ref>  West Germany and Spain joined later.\n\n== Beginnings ==\n{{Main|Western Union (alliance)|North Atlantic Treaty}}\n[[File:Truman signing North Atlantic Treaty.jpg|thumb|The North Atlantic Treaty was signed by US President Harry S.

It was signed on 17 March 1948 by Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom. It was the precursor to NATO. The Soviet threat became immediate with the [[Berlin Blockade]] in 1948, leading to the creation of a multinational defence organization, the [[Western Union Defence Organisation]], in September 1948.{{sfn|Isby|Kamps Jr.|1985|p=13}} However, the parties were too weak militarily to counter the [[Soviet Armed Forces]]. In addition, the [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'\u00e9tat]] by the Communists had overthrown a democratic government and British Foreign Minister [[Ernest Bevin]] reiterated that the best way to prevent another Czechoslovakia was to evolve a joint Western military strategy. He got a receptive hearing in the United States, especially considering American anxiety over Italy (and the [[Italian Communist Party]]).{{sfn|Pedaliu|2003|p=97}}\n\nIn 1948, European leaders met with US defence, military and diplomatic officials at the Pentagon, exploring a framework for a new and unprecedented association.<ref>Cees Wiebes and Bert Zeeman, \"The Pentagon Negotiations March 1948: The Launching of the North Atlantic Treaty.\" International Affairs 59.3 (1983): 351-363.</ref> The talks resulted in the [[North Atlantic Treaty]], The U.S. signed on 4 April 1949.

The treaty does not require members to respond with military action against an aggressor. Although obliged to respond, they maintain the freedom to choose the method by which they do so. This differs from Article&nbsp;IV of the Treaty of Brussels, which clearly states that the response will be military in nature.

These are the Office of Statistics (Mr. Loring Wood of the USA), the Financial Comptroller's Office (M. A. J.

Two were to be under German command, one with a U.S. division, one under Belgian command with a pending offer of a U.S. brigade, one under U.S. command with a German division, one under joint German-Danish command (LANDJUT), and one under Dutch command. The new German [[IV Corps (Bundeswehr)|IV Corps]] was to be stationed in Eastern Germany, and was not to be associated with the NATO structure.\n\nOn July 1, 1994, the Alliance disestablished [[Allied Command Channel]], through retaining many of its subordinate structures after reshuffling. Most of the headquarters were absorbed within ACE, particularly within the new [[Allied Forces Northwestern Europe]].<ref>Thomas-Durrell Young, [http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/display.cfm?pubID=148 Command in NATO After the Cold War: Alliance, National, and Multinational Considerations], U.S. Army Strategic Studies Institute, June 1, 1997, 11, citing JDW July 17, 1993.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Nato awacs.jpg|thumb|NATO [[E-3 Sentry|E-3A]] flying with [[United States Air Force]] [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]]s in a NATO exercise.]]\nFrom 1994 to 1999 ACE had three Major Subordinate Commands, AFNORTHWEST, AFCENT, and AFSOUTH.

Young, 'NATO After 2000,' 16-18.</ref>  The headquarters of the two Regional Commands were known as Regional Headquarters South (RHQ South) and RHQ NORTH respectively.

While international monitors mentioned a dozen deaths, some sources within Russia talked of over two hundred fatalities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0712/09/se.02.html|title=''Czar Putin'', CNN.|publisher=Transcripts.cnn.com|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref>\nThe evidence has since been examined and documented in two reports, published in Russian and English, by international organizations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} These revealed a basic confusion in terminology that explained the seemingly enormous numerical discrepancy: statistics of premature death among journalists (from work accidents, crossfire incidents, and purely criminal or domestic cases of manslaughter) were repeatedly equated with the much smaller number of targeted (contract) killings or work-related murders.\nThe [[Remembrance Day of Journalists Killed in the Line of Duty]] in Russia is observed on 15 December every year.\n\n== Methodology ==\nAmong international monitors, the figures quoted for deaths of journalists in Russia have varied, sometimes considerably. There are several explanations. Firstly, certain organisations are concerned with all aspects of safety in news gathering so the International Federation of Journalists and the [[International News Safety Institute]] also record accidents that have occurred at work.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111202205415/http://www.newssafety.org/images/pdf/KillingtheMessenger.pdf KILLING THE MESSENGER: The report on the global inquiry into the protection of journalists], INSI: Brussels, 2007.</ref> Secondly, some monitoring bodies include only fatalities in crossfire and dangerous assignments and those murders where they feel sure of the motive behind the lethal attack and can with confidence lobby the appropriate government; the CPJ adopts this approach. Thirdly, the term \"journalist\" is used by monitors as a general term to cover many different occupations within the media. Some include support staff, others do not.\n\nIn any list of deaths, compiled by monitors inside or outside the country, Russia ranks near the top for deaths. When the killing began, the brief [[First Chechen War]] took numerous journalists' lives from within Chechnya and abroad. There were also increased peacetime deaths of journalists elsewhere in the Russian Federation.\n\nThose deliberately targeted for their work tended to be reporters, correspondents, and editors. In Russia many directors of new regional TV and radio stations have been murdered<ref>\"Contract killings\", p. 21, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110610160910/http://www.ifj.org/assets/docs/235/009/f99d3eb-c1b1209.pdf PARTIAL JUSTICE], IFJ: Brussels, June 2009.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/incident:homicide/job:director |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726211634/http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/incident%3Ahomicide/job%3Adirector |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 July 2011 |title=JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA, An online database, \"Homicide of media directors\" |publisher=Journalists-in-russia.org |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}</ref> but some of these deaths are thought to relate to conflicting business interests.

Journalists died or were killed, the CPJ argued, because of the work they were doing and only one case has led to a partially successful prosecution.\n\nFollowing Russia's media monitors, the IFJ database of deaths and disappearances in Russia takes into account the entire range of media occupations and every degree of uncertainty as to the motive for many of the attacks. It also allows for selection and analysis. It classifies the way in which a journalist died (homicide, accident, crossfire, terrorist act, or not confirmed) and it assesses each death as certainly, possibly,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/motive:xJ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726211642/http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/motive%3AxJ |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 July 2011 |title=JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA, An online database,\"Deaths possibly linked to work\" |publisher=Journalists-in-russia.org |access-date=18 October 2014 }}</ref> or most probably not, linked to the journalist's work.\n\nSince the early 1990s, Russia's media monitors have recorded every violent or suspicious death that came to their attention. Determining which were linked to the journalist's work has not always been easy since law enforcement agencies in Russia were struggling to cope with a wave of murders and the number of unsolved killings of journalists steadily mounted. In the last few years,{{When|date=June 2017}} the Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations has gathered all available information about these deaths on its Memoriam site.<ref>[http://memorium.cjes.ru/?pid=1&l=\u0413/ MEMORIUM. \u041f\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0431\u0448\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0435 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b].

The IFJ data base summarises the information accumulated on the Memoriam site and makes it available in English for the first time. During a study of international fraud-detection homicide, which compared fraud detection homicide cases from the United States of America against fraud detection homicide cases from the former Soviet Republic, the murder of Paula Klebenikov illustrated a case of a contract killing of a journalist known to expose fraud in governments.  At the time of his murder, he was thought to be investigating complex money laundering fraud scheme involving Chechen reconstruction projects. The investigation appears to reveal that Klebnikov had discovered that the fraud reached deep into the centers of power in the Kremlin, elements involving organized crime, and also the former KGB, now known as the FSB.<ref>Perri, Frank S. and Lichtenwald, Terrance G.

It is not enough to put the killer on trial; they must be accompanied, or followed, by their accomplices, and the intermediaries and individuals who ordered and paid for the killing.\n\nThe IFJ report opens and closes with the Politkovskaya murder and the subsequent trial, which ran from November 2008 to February 2009. After 16 years of unsolved killings, the international outcry over her death made this a test case that might finally breach the barrier of partial justice. The evidence presented by the prosecution, unfortunately, did not convince the jury or satisfy other key participants.<ref>See [https://web.archive.org/web/20090906133824/http://en.novayagazeta.ru/data/2009/18/00.html \"The whole system stands condemned\", 20 February 2009, Novaya gazeta].

They call on Russian authorities to give investigators and courts the backing they need to identify and pursue all those responsible for the deaths of journalists and, in the meanwhile, to keep the press and the public better informed about their progress in tackling such disturbing crimes.\n\n== International comparisons ==\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s the [[List of countries by intentional homicide rate|homicide rate in Russia]] was among the highest in the world.<ref>\"[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russian-murder-rate-among-worlds-worst-1486129.html Russian murder rate among world's worst]\".

With only three exceptions these have all been for homicide. Some cases have taken six to seven years to reach court (e.g. the killings of Dmitry Kholodov and [[Igor Domnikov]]) but most deaths that have resulted in prosecution take, on average, 12\u201324 months between the killing and the verdict.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/incident:homicide/date:2006/impunity:trial |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819033215/http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/incident%3Ahomicide/date%3A2006/impunity%3Atrial |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 August 2011 |title=JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA, An online database, \"Trials for 2006 homicides\" |publisher=Journalists-in-russia.org |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/date:2007/impunity:trial |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726211930/http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/date%3A2007/impunity%3Atrial |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 July 2011 |title=JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA, An online database, \"Trials for 2007 deaths\" |publisher=Journalists-in-russia.org |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\nRates of conviction are a different matter. When the death was not related to the journalist's work the conviction rate exceeds 90%. When the journalist's death was certainly or seems likely to have been related to his or her work, the rate of acquittals rise sharply to around half of the total. Most trials are still held before a judge, aided by two lay assessors. Trial by judge and jury, which is still very rare in Russia, generally offers a more rigorous testing of evidence, robust defence of the suspects, and a higher chance of the defendant being found not guilty (average acquittal rate of 20%). The Politkovskaya murder trial, which was held before a jury, ended in February 2009 with the acquittal of all those accused.\n\nIf approximately three quarters of journalists's murders over the past 16 years were not related to their investigations and publications However, the CJES considers that up to 70% of assaults, which annually run into the dozens, are work-related. Sometimes these are very serious. In November 2008, Mikhail Beketov, chief editor of the ''Khimkinskaya pravda'', a paper in a Moscow suburb, was beaten so severely that although he survived, and his paper even resumed limited publication, by early 2010 he had still not regained the power of speech or independent movement.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/world/europe/18impunity.html?scp=2&sq=levy&st=nyt | title=It's Open Season on Journalists Near Moscow | first=Clifford J. | last=Levy | date=17 May 2010 | work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/world/europe/18interrogate.html?ref=europe | title=Beaten Russian Editor Is Told to Say It's His Fault | first=Clifford J. | last=Levy | date=17 May 2010 | work=The New York Times}}</ref> He died in 2013.\n\n==Concern abroad==\nOver the past decade the Russian authorities have been repeatedly urged by Western governments and international media bodies to do more to investigate the deaths of journalists.

However, Russia's sought-for status as a member of [[G8]] from 1997 onwards set a benchmark that showed the continuing deaths of journalists, and of other media restrictions within the country, in an unfavourable light. Also of importance was the country's admission to the Council of Europe and, as a result, the potential involvement, after 1998, of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] as an arbiter of last resort. Unsuccessful attempts were made for the 2004 acquittal of Dmitry Kholodov's alleged killers to be examined in Strasbourg. So far the Court has only once determined the failure of the Russian authorities to pursue those responsible for the violent deaths of journalists. In 2005 it ruled that the October 1999 killing in Chechnya of cameramen Ramzan Mezhidov and Shamil Gigayev and of more than thirty other civilians who died during the same incident had not been properly investigated.<ref>A complaint was lodged with the Court in 2000 by the [[Memorial]] human rights organisation, on behalf of relatives of civilians who died alongside the two cameramen.

While international monitors mentioned a dozen deaths, some sources within Russia talked of over two hundred fatalities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0712/09/se.02.html|title=''Czar Putin'', CNN.|publisher=Transcripts.cnn.com|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref>\nThe evidence has since been examined and documented in two reports, published in Russian and English, by international organizations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} These revealed a basic confusion in terminology that explained the seemingly enormous numerical discrepancy: statistics of premature death among journalists (from work accidents, crossfire incidents, and purely criminal or domestic cases of manslaughter) were repeatedly equated with the much smaller number of targeted (contract) killings or work-related murders.\nThe [[Remembrance Day of Journalists Killed in the Line of Duty]] in Russia is observed on 15 December every year.\n\n== Methodology ==\nAmong international monitors, the figures quoted for deaths of journalists in Russia have varied, sometimes considerably. There are several explanations. Firstly, certain organisations are concerned with all aspects of safety in news gathering so the International Federation of Journalists and the [[International News Safety Institute]] also record accidents that have occurred at work.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111202205415/http://www.newssafety.org/images/pdf/KillingtheMessenger.pdf KILLING THE MESSENGER: The report on the global inquiry into the protection of journalists], INSI: Brussels, 2007.</ref> Secondly, some monitoring bodies include only fatalities in crossfire and dangerous assignments and those murders where they feel sure of the motive behind the lethal attack and can with confidence lobby the appropriate government; the CPJ adopts this approach. Thirdly, the term \"journalist\" is used by monitors as a general term to cover many different occupations within the media. Some include support staff, others do not.\n\nIn any list of deaths, compiled by monitors inside or outside the country, Russia ranks near the top for deaths. When the killing began, the brief [[First Chechen War]] took numerous journalists' lives from within Chechnya and abroad. There were also increased peacetime deaths of journalists elsewhere in the Russian Federation.\n\nThose deliberately targeted for their work tended to be reporters, correspondents, and editors. In Russia many directors of new regional TV and radio stations have been murdered<ref>\"Contract killings\", p. 21, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110610160910/http://www.ifj.org/assets/docs/235/009/f99d3eb-c1b1209.pdf PARTIAL JUSTICE], IFJ: Brussels, June 2009.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/incident:homicide/job:director |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726211634/http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/incident%3Ahomicide/job%3Adirector |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 July 2011 |title=JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA, An online database, \"Homicide of media directors\" |publisher=Journalists-in-russia.org |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}</ref> but some of these deaths are thought to relate to conflicting business interests.

It also allows for selection and analysis. It classifies the way in which a journalist died (homicide, accident, crossfire, terrorist act, or not confirmed) and it assesses each death as certainly, possibly,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/motive:xJ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726211642/http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/motive%3AxJ |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 July 2011 |title=JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA, An online database,\"Deaths possibly linked to work\" |publisher=Journalists-in-russia.org |access-date=18 October 2014 }}</ref> or most probably not, linked to the journalist's work.\n\nSince the early 1990s, Russia's media monitors have recorded every violent or suspicious death that came to their attention. Determining which were linked to the journalist's work has not always been easy since law enforcement agencies in Russia were struggling to cope with a wave of murders and the number of unsolved killings of journalists steadily mounted. In the last few years,{{When|date=June 2017}} the Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations has gathered all available information about these deaths on its Memoriam site.<ref>[http://memorium.cjes.ru/?pid=1&l=\u0413/ MEMORIUM. \u041f\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0431\u0448\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0435 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b].

The IFJ data base summarises the information accumulated on the Memoriam site and makes it available in English for the first time. During a study of international fraud-detection homicide, which compared fraud detection homicide cases from the United States of America against fraud detection homicide cases from the former Soviet Republic, the murder of Paula Klebenikov illustrated a case of a contract killing of a journalist known to expose fraud in governments.  At the time of his murder, he was thought to be investigating complex money laundering fraud scheme involving Chechen reconstruction projects. The investigation appears to reveal that Klebnikov had discovered that the fraud reached deep into the centers of power in the Kremlin, elements involving organized crime, and also the former KGB, now known as the FSB.<ref>Perri, Frank S. and Lichtenwald, Terrance G.

With only three exceptions these have all been for homicide. Some cases have taken six to seven years to reach court (e.g. the killings of Dmitry Kholodov and [[Igor Domnikov]]) but most deaths that have resulted in prosecution take, on average, 12\u201324 months between the killing and the verdict.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/incident:homicide/date:2006/impunity:trial |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819033215/http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/incident%3Ahomicide/date%3A2006/impunity%3Atrial |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 August 2011 |title=JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA, An online database, \"Trials for 2006 homicides\" |publisher=Journalists-in-russia.org |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/date:2007/impunity:trial |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726211930/http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/date%3A2007/impunity%3Atrial |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 July 2011 |title=JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA, An online database, \"Trials for 2007 deaths\" |publisher=Journalists-in-russia.org |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\nRates of conviction are a different matter. When the death was not related to the journalist's work the conviction rate exceeds 90%. When the journalist's death was certainly or seems likely to have been related to his or her work, the rate of acquittals rise sharply to around half of the total. Most trials are still held before a judge, aided by two lay assessors. Trial by judge and jury, which is still very rare in Russia, generally offers a more rigorous testing of evidence, robust defence of the suspects, and a higher chance of the defendant being found not guilty (average acquittal rate of 20%). The Politkovskaya murder trial, which was held before a jury, ended in February 2009 with the acquittal of all those accused.\n\nIf approximately three quarters of journalists's murders over the past 16 years were not related to their investigations and publications However, the CJES considers that up to 70% of assaults, which annually run into the dozens, are work-related. Sometimes these are very serious. In November 2008, Mikhail Beketov, chief editor of the ''Khimkinskaya pravda'', a paper in a Moscow suburb, was beaten so severely that although he survived, and his paper even resumed limited publication, by early 2010 he had still not regained the power of speech or independent movement.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/world/europe/18impunity.html?scp=2&sq=levy&st=nyt | title=It's Open Season on Journalists Near Moscow | first=Clifford J. | last=Levy | date=17 May 2010 | work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/world/europe/18interrogate.html?ref=europe | title=Beaten Russian Editor Is Told to Say It's His Fault | first=Clifford J. | last=Levy | date=17 May 2010 | work=The New York Times}}</ref> He died in 2013.\n\n==Concern abroad==\nOver the past decade the Russian authorities have been repeatedly urged by Western governments and international media bodies to do more to investigate the deaths of journalists.

However, Russia's sought-for status as a member of [[G8]] from 1997 onwards set a benchmark that showed the continuing deaths of journalists, and of other media restrictions within the country, in an unfavourable light. Also of importance was the country's admission to the Council of Europe and, as a result, the potential involvement, after 1998, of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] as an arbiter of last resort. Unsuccessful attempts were made for the 2004 acquittal of Dmitry Kholodov's alleged killers to be examined in Strasbourg. So far the Court has only once determined the failure of the Russian authorities to pursue those responsible for the violent deaths of journalists. In 2005 it ruled that the October 1999 killing in Chechnya of cameramen Ramzan Mezhidov and Shamil Gigayev and of more than thirty other civilians who died during the same incident had not been properly investigated.<ref>A complaint was lodged with the Court in 2000 by the [[Memorial]] human rights organisation, on behalf of relatives of civilians who died alongside the two cameramen.

The ridge is located on the territory of the [[Uygur District|Uyghur]] and [[Raiymbek District|Raiymbek]] districts of the [[Almaty Region|Almaty region]], also located on the territory of the [[Kazakhstan|Republic of Kazakhstan]] and the China republic. \n\nThe total length of the ridge is 310 km. The length of the ridge on the territory of Kazakhstan is 160 km. The width of the ridge reaches 40\u201350&nbsp;km. The highest point of the range is Mount Aspan (3,652 m). \n\nThe ridge is adjacent to the Kungei-AlaToo ridge in the West and the Narat ridge in the East. The Northern slopes of the ridge pass into the Ili valley. Ketmen forms the southern border of [[Zhetysu|Semirechye]]. \n\nThe ridge is composed of igneous rocks and sedimentary rocks such as effusions, granite, and limestone. The slopes of the Ridge are steep with gentle peaks below the snow line. The ridge has a permafrost zone but does not have glaciation and snowfields. There are steppes and taiga forests, which consist mainly of spruce trees and meadows in high-altitude zones. At the foot of the southern slope of the ridge, [[steppe bison]] remains have been found. \n\nThe eponymous Ketmen pass is located at an altitude of 3,040 meters above sea level in the eastern part of the mountain range. A caravan trail from the Ili valley to the Kegen-Tekes hollow is laid through the pass, which connects the Northern slope in the Ketmen gorge and southern slope of the ridge of the Shalkudysu river valley.\n\nThe Ketmen ridge is rich in terms of flora. Research has found that the Ketmen ridge consists of 1890 species of vascular plants, along with the Chinese part which are angiosperms, dicots, and monocots. 84 species from 11 genera of rust fungi were found. The largest genera found were [[Puccinia]] with 48 species, and [[Uromyces]] with 12 species.\n\n== Source and links ==\n* \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d. \u041e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430 / \u0422. \u041f. \u0424\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430 (\u0440\u0435\u0434.). \u2014 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f. \u2014 \u041e\u043c\u0441\u043a: \u041e\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0444\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430, 2011. \u2014 {{ISBN|978-5-9523-0332-4}}.\n* \u0421\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u044b \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0421\u043e\u044e\u0437\u0430 / \u041f\u043e\u0434 \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0444. \u0421. \u041c. \u0424\u043b\u0435\u0439\u0448\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0434. \u0433\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440. \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a \u0412. \u0424. \u041f\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430. \u2014 \u041c. : \u0418\u0437\u0434-\u0432\u043e \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a. \u0443\u043d-\u0442\u0430, 1976.\n* \u041a\u0435\u0442\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0445\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0442 // \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d. \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u044d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f. \u2014 \u0410\u043b\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044b: \u049a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u049b \u044d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f\u0441\u044b, 2005. \u2014 \u0422.

The ridge is located on the territory of the [[Uygur District|Uyghur]] and [[Raiymbek District|Raiymbek]] districts of the [[Almaty Region|Almaty region]], also located on the territory of the [[Kazakhstan|Republic of Kazakhstan]] and the China republic. \n\nThe total length of the ridge is 310 km. The length of the ridge on the territory of Kazakhstan is 160 km. The width of the ridge reaches 40\u201350&nbsp;km. The highest point of the range is Mount Aspan (3,652 m). \n\nThe ridge is adjacent to the Kungei-AlaToo ridge in the West and the Narat ridge in the East. The Northern slopes of the ridge pass into the Ili valley. Ketmen forms the southern border of [[Zhetysu|Semirechye]]. \n\nThe ridge is composed of igneous rocks: effusions and granite, and limestone are present among the sedimentary rocks. The slopes of the Ridge are sloping with steep ascents at gentle peaks that do not reach the level of the snow line. The ridge has a permafrost zone but does not have glaciation and snowfields. There are steppes and taiga forests, which consist mainly of spruce trees and meadows in high-altitude zones. At the foot of the southern slope of the ridge, the remains of [[steppe bison]] have been found. \n\nThe eponymous Ketmen pass is located at an altitude of 3,040 meters above sea level in the eastern part of the mountain range. A caravan trail from the Ili valley to the Kegen-Tekes hollow is laid through the pass, which connects the Northern slope in the Ketmen gorge and southern slope of the ridge of the Shalkudysu river valley.\n\nThe Ketmen ridge is rich in terms of flora. Research has found that the Ketmen ridge consists of 1890 species of vascular plants, along with the Chinese part which are angiosperms, dicots, and monocots. 84 species from 11 genera of rust fungi were found. The largest genera found were [[Puccinia]] with 48 species, and [[Uromyces]] with 12 species.\n\n== Source and links ==\n* \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d. \u041e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430 / \u0422. \u041f. \u0424\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430 (\u0440\u0435\u0434.). \u2014 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f. \u2014 \u041e\u043c\u0441\u043a: \u041e\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0444\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430, 2011. \u2014 {{ISBN|978-5-9523-0332-4}}.\n* \u0421\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u044b \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0421\u043e\u044e\u0437\u0430 / \u041f\u043e\u0434 \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0444. \u0421. \u041c. \u0424\u043b\u0435\u0439\u0448\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0434. \u0433\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440. \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a \u0412. \u0424. \u041f\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430. \u2014 \u041c. : \u0418\u0437\u0434-\u0432\u043e \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a. \u0443\u043d-\u0442\u0430, 1976.\n* \u041a\u0435\u0442\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0445\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0442 // \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d. \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u044d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f. \u2014 \u0410\u043b\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044b: \u049a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u049b \u044d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f\u0441\u044b, 2005. \u2014 \u0422.

Hainz]]\n'''Martin Andreas Hainz''' (born March 5, 1974, in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]) is an [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[philologist]], [[theorist]] and [[philosopher]]. He has taught at several universities in Europe and the [[United States]], among them the universities of Vienna, [[Timi\u0219oara]] and [[Ia\u015fi]]. He is a member of the ''Northeastern Language Association'' ([[NEMLA]]). His main interests are contemporary German and especially [[Austrian philosophy]] and [[Austrian literature|literature]]. He is a scholar of [[Wendelin Schmidt-Dengler]].\n\n==Biography==\nHainz's works deal with [[Paul Celan]] and [[Rose Ausl\u00e4nder]] as well as [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]]; he is also considered to be one of today's most important advocates of [[Jacques Derrida]]'s [[deconstruction]].<ref>Fran\u00e7oise Lartillot: ''Martin Hainz \u2013 Masken der Mehrdeutigkeit.'' In: \u00c9tudes Germaniques, Nr. 59 (2004): 1, p. 167</ref> His interdisciplinary work has often led to surprising insights; this is especially true concerning Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, who is an ambivalent thinker and poet between sensibility, belief and inspiration. Hainz has shown that, from a dialectical perspective, poetry is the ''rational awareness that is adequate to ([[Jewish]]-[[Christianity|Christian]]) believing and faith'' (''\"Poesie ist also der dem Glauben angemessene Wachzustand\"'').\n\nHainz' researches into some nearly forgotten, but nevertheless important authors and thinkers such as [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]], [[Alfred Margul-Sperber]] and [[Constantin Brunner]] are also of merit. He has done important research dealing with [[multiculturalism]] and its opportunities and history in [[Czernowitz]], which is considered to be a paradigm for multicultural societies. These works have led Hainz to some research on translation and its theory; his volume ''Vom Gl\u00fcck sich anzustecken'' (''Being affected by Luck'' or ''The Luck of Being Infected'') has been discussed intensely. [[Vincent Kling (translator)|Vincent Kling]] in his review considered it to be \"beyond praise\".<ref>Vincent Kling: ''Martin A.

He is a scholar of [[Wendelin Schmidt-Dengler]].\n\n==Biography==\nHainz's works deal with [[Paul Celan]] and [[Rose Ausl\u00e4nder]] as well as [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]]; he is also considered to be one of today's most important advocates of [[Jacques Derrida]]'s [[deconstruction]].<ref>Fran\u00e7oise Lartillot: ''Martin Hainz \u2013 Masken der Mehrdeutigkeit.'' In: \u00c9tudes Germaniques, Nr. 59 (2004): 1, p. 167</ref> His interdisciplinary work has often led to surprising insights; this is especially true concerning Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, who is an ambivalent thinker and poet between sensibility, belief and inspiration. Hainz has shown that, from a dialectical perspective, poetry is the ''rational awareness that is adequate to ([[Jewish]]-[[Christianity|Christian]]) believing and faith'' (''\"Poesie ist also der dem Glauben angemessene Wachzustand\"'').\n\nHainz' researches into some nearly forgotten, but nevertheless important authors and thinkers such as [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]], [[Alfred Margul-Sperber]] and [[Constantin Brunner]] are also of merit. He has done important research dealing with [[multiculturalism]] and its opportunities and history in [[Czernowitz]], which is considered to be a paradigm for multicultural societies. These works have led Hainz to some research on translation and its theory; his volume ''Vom Gl\u00fcck sich anzustecken'' (''Being affected by Luck'' or ''The Luck of Being Infected'') has been discussed intensely. [[Vincent Kling (translator)|Vincent Kling]] in his review considered it to be \"beyond praise\".<ref>Vincent Kling: ''Martin A.
