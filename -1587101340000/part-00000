This task was given to [[Juli\u00e1n Felipe]] and was to replace a march which Aguinaldo had deemed unsatisfactory. The original title of this new march was \"Marcha Filipina-Magdalo\" (\"Philippine-[[Magdalo (Katipunan faction)|Magdalo]] March\"), and was later changed to \"Marcha Nacional Filipina\" (\"Philippine National March\") upon its adoption as the national anthem of the [[First Philippine Republic]] on 11 June 1898, a day before independence was to be proclaimed.\n\nFelipe said that he had based his composition on three other musical pieces: the \"[[Marcha Real]]\", which is the current Spanish national anthem; the \"[[Grand March]]\" from [[Giuseppe Verdi|Giuseppe Verdi's]] ''[[Aida]]''; and the French national anthem, \"[[La Marseillaise]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://malacanang.gov.ph/7815-the-national-anthems-predecessor-and-influences/|title=The National Anthem's predecessor and influences|publisher=[[Malaca\u00f1ang Palace]]|accessdate=2015-12-26}}</ref> It was played by the Banda San Francisco de Malabon (now called the ''Banda Matanda'', from present-day [[General Trias, Cavite|General Trias]]) during the proclamation rites on 12 June.\n\nIn August 1899, the soldier and writer [[Jos\u00e9 Palma]] penned the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] poem ''[[Lupang Hinirang#Filipinas|Filipinas]]'' during his stay in Casa Hacienda in [[Bautista, Pangasinan]].

The second most popular one was ''[[Lupang Hinirang#O Sintang Lupa|O Sintang Lupa]]'' (\"O Beloved Land\") by [[Julian Cruz Balmaceda|Juli\u00e1n Cruz Balmaceda]], [[Ildefonso Santos]], and Francisco Caballo; this was adopted as the official version in 1948.

On 26 May 1956, the [[Filipino language|Pilipino]] translation \"Lupang Hinirang\" was sung for the first time. Minor revisions were made in the 1960s, and it is [[Lupang Hinirang#Official lyric|this version]] by Felipe Padilla de Le\u00f3n which is presently used. \n\nThe [[Martial Law in the Philippines|Martial Law years from 1972\u20131981]] during the second term of [[Ferdinand Marcos]] up to the [[People Power Revolution|1986 EDSA Revolution]] saw the use of the National Anthem as the opening protest song of some political and union groups, accompanied by the use of the \"raised clenched fist\" salute instead of the traditional hand-to-heart salute.\n\nThe [[Filipino language|Filipino]]{{efn|Spelled with an F since 1973, affirmed in 1987 \u2013 see respective [[Philippine Constitution|Constitutions]]}} lyrics have been confirmed by [[Republic Acts of the Philippines|Republic Act]] No. 8491 (the \"Flag and Heraldic Code of the Philippines\") in 1998, abandoning use of both the Spanish and English versions.<ref name=\"ra8491\" />\n\nHistorian [[Ambeth Ocampo]] observed that the Spanish lyrics, which were not intended to be sung when composed, do not flow with the music very well compared to later English and Filipino versions which are smoother. Also, some of the original meanings in ''Filipinas'' have been lost in translation; for example, the original ''Hija del sol de oriente'' (literally, \"Daughter of the Orient (Eastern) Sun\") became \"Child of the sun returning\" in the Philippine Hymn and ''Perlas ng Silanganan'' (\"Pearl of the Orient\") in the present official Tagalog version.<ref name = \"mabini\">{{cite book|last=Ocampo |first=Ambeth R. |authorlink= Ambeth Ocampo |title=Mabini's Ghost |year=1995 |publisher=Anvil Publishing |location=[[Pasig City]], [[Philippines]]}}</ref>\n\n===Other anthems===\n\"Lupang Hinirang\" was not the first Filipino national anthem to be conceived. The composer and revolutionist [[Julio Nakpil]] penned ''[[Marangal na Dalit ng Katagalugan]]'' (Honourable Hymn of the ''Katagalugan''), which was later called ''Salve Patria'' (\"Hail, Fatherland\"). It was originally intended to be the official anthem of the ''[[Katipunan]]'', the secret society that spearheaded the Revolution. It is considered a national anthem because [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]], the chief founder and ''Supremo'' of the ''Katipunan'', converted the organization into a revolutionary government\u2014with himself as President\u2014known as the ''Republika ng Katagalugan'' ([[Tagalog Republic]]) just before hostilities erupted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about_cultarts/articles.php?artcl_Id=5|title=Andres Bonifacio and the 1896 Revolution|last=Guerrero|first=Milagros C.|publisher=National Commission for culture and the Arts (NCCA)|accessdate=26 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118020717/http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about_cultarts/articles.php?artcl_Id=5 |archivedate=18 January 2008}}</ref> The arrangement was by Julio Nakpil, who reconstructed it from memory after the original score was destroyed in 1945 during the battle for Manila. It would later be reworked and incorporated in the orchestral piece, ''Salve, Filipinas''. \n\nThe ''Katipunan'' or ''Republika ng Katagalugan'' was superseded by Aguinaldo's ''[[First Philippine Republic|Republica Filipina]]''. The anthem, later renamed ''Himno Nacional'', was never adopted by Aguinaldo for unspecified reasons. The term \"''Katagalugan''\" in the anthem referred the Philippine Islands as a whole and not just [[Tagalog language|Tagalophone]] [[Filipino people|Filipinos]].\n\nThe translation of \"Lupang Hinirang\" was used by Felipe Padilla de Leon as his inspiration for ''[[Awit sa Paglikha ng Bagong Pilipinas]]'', commissioned as a replacement anthem by the [[Japanese Occupation of the Philippines|Japanese-controlled]] [[Second Philippine Republic]] during [[World War II]], and later adapted during the [[Martial Law in the Philippines|martial law era]] under President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] under the patriotic anthem entitled as ''[[Bagong Pagsilang]]''.\n\n==Lyrics==\nThe following Spanish, English and Filipino versions of the national anthem have been given official status throughout Philippine history. However, only the most recent and current Filipino version is officially recognised by law.

On 26 May 1956, the [[Filipino language|Pilipino]] translation \"Lupang Hinirang\" was sung for the first time. Minor revisions were made in the 1960s, and it is [[Lupang Hinirang#Official lyric|this version]] by Felipe Padilla de Le\u00f3n which is presently used. \n\nThe [[Martial Law in the Philippines|Martial Law years from 1972\u20131981]] during the second term of [[Ferdinand Marcos]] up to the [[People Power Revolution|1986 EDSA Revolution]] saw the use of the National Anthem as the opening protest song of some political and union groups, accompanied by the use of the \"raised clenched fist\" salute instead of the traditional hand-to-heart salute.\n\nThe [[Filipino language|Filipino]]{{efn|Spelled with an F since 1973, affirmed in 1987 \u2013 see respective [[Philippine Constitution|Constitutions]]}} lyrics have been confirmed by [[Republic Acts of the Philippines|Republic Act]] No. 8491 (the \"Flag and Heraldic Code of the Philippines\") in 1998, abandoning use of both the Spanish and English versions.<ref name=\"ra8491\" />\n\nHistorian [[Ambeth Ocampo]] observed that the Spanish lyrics, which were not intended to be sung when composed, do not flow with the music very well compared to later English and Filipino versions which are smoother. Also, some of the original meanings in ''Filipinas'' have been lost in translation; for example, the original ''Hija del sol de oriente'' (literally, \"Daughter of the Orient (Eastern) Sun\") became \"Child of the sun returning\" in the Philippine Hymn and ''Perlas ng Silanganan'' (\"Pearl of the Orient\") in the present official Tagalog version.<ref name = \"mabini\">{{cite book|last=Ocampo |first=Ambeth R. |authorlink= Ambeth Ocampo |title=Mabini's Ghost |year=1995 |publisher=Anvil Publishing |location=[[Pasig City]], [[Philippines]]}}</ref>\n\n===Other anthems===\n\"Lupang Hinirang\" was not the first Filipino national anthem to be conceived. The composer and revolutionist [[Julio Nakpil]] penned ''[[Marangal na Dalit ng Katagalugan]]'' (Honourable Hymn of the ''Katagalugan''), which was later called ''Salve Patria'' (\"Hail, Fatherland\"). It was originally intended to be the official anthem of the ''[[Katipunan]]'', the secret society that spearheaded the Revolution. It is considered a national anthem because [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]], the chief founder and ''Supremo'' of the ''Katipunan'', converted the organization into a revolutionary government\u2014with himself as President\u2014known as the ''Republika ng Katagalugan'' ([[Tagalog Republic]]) just before hostilities erupted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about_cultarts/articles.php?artcl_Id=5|title=Andres Bonifacio and the 1896 Revolution|last=Guerrero|first=Milagros C.|publisher=National Commission for culture and the Arts (NCCA)|accessdate=26 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118020717/http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about_cultarts/articles.php?artcl_Id=5 |archivedate=18 January 2008}}</ref> The arrangement was by Julio Nakpil, who reconstructed it from memory after the original score was destroyed in 1945 during the battle for Manila. It would later be reworked and incorporated in the orchestral piece, ''Salve, Filipinas''. \n\nThe ''Katipunan'' or ''Republika ng Katagalugan'' was superseded by Aguinaldo's ''[[First Philippine Republic|Republica Filipina]]''. The anthem, later renamed ''Himno Nacional'', was never adopted by Aguinaldo for unspecified reasons. The term \"''Katagalugan''\" in the anthem referred the Philippine Islands as a whole and not just [[Tagalog language|Tagalophone]] [[Filipino people|Filipinos]].\n\nThe translation of \"Lupang Hinirang\" was used by Felipe Padilla de Leon as his inspiration for ''[[Awit sa Paglikha ng Bagong Pilipinas]]'', commissioned as a replacement anthem by the [[Japanese Occupation of the Philippines|Japanese-controlled]] [[Second Philippine Republic]] during [[World War II]], and later adapted during the [[Martial Law in the Philippines|martial law era]] under President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] under the patriotic anthem entitled as ''[[Bagong Pagsilang]]''.\n\n==Lyrics==\nThe following Spanish, English and Filipino versions of the national anthem have been given official status throughout Philippine history. However, only the most recent and current Filipino version is officially recognised by law. The Flag and Heraldic Code, approved on 12 February 1998 specifies, \"The National Anthem shall always be sung in the [[Filipino language|national language]] within or outside the country; violation of the law is punishable by a fine and imprisonment.<ref name=\"ra8491\" /> Several bills have been introduced to amend the Flag and Heraldic Code to highlight the importance of\ncomplying, abiding and conforming to the standard expression as prescribed by law. {{as of|2015}}, none have been enacted into law.<ref>{{cite news |title=Philippines national anthem abuse subject to new law |author=Kate McGeown |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11473753 |work=BBC News |date=5 October 2010 |accessdate=12 February 2013}}</ref><ref>Introduced bills:\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov.ph/lis/bill_res.aspx?congress=14&q=SBN-772|title=14th Congress : Senate Bill No. 772 : PHILIPPINE NATIONAL ANTHEM|publisher=Senate of the Philippines|date=September 3, 2007}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov.ph/lis/bill_res.aspx?congress=15&q=SBN-2619|title=15th Congress : Senate Bill No. 2619 : PHILIPPINE NATIONAL ANTHEM|publisher=Senate of the Philippines|date=December 7, 2010}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov.ph/lis/bill_res.aspx?congress=14&q=SBN-2691|title=15th Congress : Senate Bill No. 2691 : PHILIPPINE NATIONAL ANTHEM|publisher=Senate of the Philippines|date=February 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" cellpadding=\"10\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"background:white;\"\n! {{big|Original Spanish Version <br>''Marcha Nacional Filipina'' (1899)}}<ref name=\"palmabook\" /><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wwZgb0Oy4RkC&pg=PA35&dq=%C2%A1Patria+de+amores!+Del+hero%C3%ADsmo+cuna,#v=onepage&q=%C2%A1Patria%20de%20amores!%20Del%20hero%C3%ADsmo%20cuna,&f=false|title=Imperios y naciones en el Pac\u00edfico: Colonialismo e identidad nacional en Filipinas y Micronesia|last=P\u00e9rez-Grueso|first=Mar\u00eda Dolores Elizalde|last2=Elizalde|first2=Mar\u00eda Dolores|last3=Fradera|first3=Josep Maria|author-link3=Josep Maria Fradera|last4=\u00c1lvarez|first4=L.

As time passes, however, students may forget the original lyrics, and replace some words with [[misheard lyrics|similar-sounding ones]]. The most common is the replacement of the word ''niya'' (third person possessive; \"her/his/its\") in \"''Ang bituin at araw niya''\" (\"its stars and sun\") with either ''nang'' (\"so\", \"in this manner\", \"that is\") or ''niya't'' (contracted \"and\" with \"hers/his\").\n\nOther common errors include substitution of ''na'' (\"when\") in \"''Aming ligaya na 'pag may mang-aapi''\" (\"'Tis our joy when there be oppressor\") with \"''ng''\" (\"of\"); \"''alab''\" (\"flame\", \"passion\") in \"''Alab ng puso''\" (\"Burning of the heart\") with \"''alam''\" (\"know\", \"knowledge\"); and \"''mong''\" (contraction of ''mo'' and ''ng'', meaning \"yours that is\") in \"''Sa langit mong bughaw''\" (\"in the heavens of yours which is blue\") with \"''mo'y''\" (\"yours is\").\n===Proposed lyrical revision===\nThe final line of the national anthem, ''Ang mamatay nang dahil sa 'yo'' (For us thy sons to suffer and die), is subject to certain proposed revisions for being [[defeatism|defeatist]]. in 2013, Filipino musician [[Joey Ayala]], tampered with the national anthem in a forum by changing the last line to ''ang magmahal ng dahil sa 'yo (to love for the country)'' and arranged the time signature from 4/4 to 6/8.<ref>[https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/43933-joey-ayala-lupang-hinirang Joey Ayala's version of 'Lupang Hinirang']</ref> Senate President [[Tito Sotto|Vicente Sotto III]] suggested that last line should be revised to ''Ang ipaglaban ang kalayaan mo (To defend thy freedom)'' as it reflects the commitment of the [[Filipinos]] to defend the country's independence.<ref>[https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/09/19/18/sotto-wants-philippine-national-anthem-revised Sotto wants Philippine national anthem revised]</ref>\n\n==Music and tempo==\n{{Culture of the Philippines}}\nR.A. 8491 specifies that \"Lupang Hinirang\" when performed \"shall be in accordance with the musical arrangement and composition of [[Juli\u00e1n Felipe]].\"<ref name=\"ambeth\" />  However, when literally followed, this means that the national anthem should only be performed by a pianist or by a brass band, as these were the only versions that were produced by Juli\u00e1n Felipe.<ref name=\"ambeth\" /> Moreover, the original version was composed in duple time (i.e., in a [[time signature]] of 2/4) as compared to the present quadruple time (4/4).

He staged massive [[Rosary]] rallies in key cities of the world and extensively utilized mass communication, helped by world-recognized celebrities of [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] at that time, promoting his ministry of binding families through prayer under the Family Rosary. Peyton was a popular and charismatic figure in [[Latin America]] and the [[Philippines]], where he promoted the [[Rosary]] and was known for his strong [[Irish people|Irish]] accent.\n\nPeyton popularized the phrases \"[[The family that prays together stays together]]\" and \"A world at prayer is a world at peace\".\n\n[[Pope Francis]] furthered Peyton towards sainthood by confirming his [[heroic virtue]] and naming him as [[Venerable]] on December 18, 2017.\n\n==Early life==\nPeyton was born Patrick Joseph Peyton in [[Attymass]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]],<ref name=chc>[http://holycrosscongregation.org/holy-ones/servant-of-god-patrick-peyton/ \"Venerable Patrick Peyton\", Congregation of Holy Cross]</ref> to subsistence-farmers John and Mary Gillard Peyton. Peyton was the sixth in a deeply religious family of four girls and five boys living in a small cottage at a 14-acre (5.66&nbsp;hectares) stony farmland near the foot of the Ox Mountains. Later on, some members of the family migrated to the United States.\n\nPeyton was sent to his mother's relatives in [[Bonniconlon]] to study at a school run by Tadhg O\u2019Leary in Bofield. As a young man, Peyton was rebellious and had moments of defying authority, resulting in dropping out of school. Despite the youthful rebellion, he remained close to his family, and deeply religious.\n\nBy his teen years, he was contemplating a vocation to become a priest. Although religious recruiters such as the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]] and the [[Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer|Redemptorist]] fathers visited Carracastle in search of young men wanting to pursue the priesthood, Peyton concentrated on helping his family earn a living when their father became too ill to work the farm. Some of his elder sisters were already in America and were sending remittances to help the family left in Ireland. In 1927, his sisters sent word that Patrick and his older brother Thomas could sail to the United States and join them in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. On May 13, 1928, the Peyton brothers set sail.\n\n==America==\nThe brothers arrived in [[New York City|New York]] after a 10-day trip, traveling by steerage. The two took the train from New York to [[Pennsylvania]] and lived at the home of their already married sister Beatrice, who was working as a housekeeper for [[Thomas J. Baldrige]], the state Attorney General. Peyton's sister Nellie had already spoken to [[Monsignor]] Paul Kelly of [[St. Peter's Cathedral (Scranton, Pennsylvania)|Saint Peter's Cathedral]] and mentioned Peyton's interest in pursuing a [[Seminary|priestly vocation]]. Monsignor Kelly told Nellie to bring her younger brother Patrick to the cathedral as soon as he arrived. By June 1928, with hard luck in finding a job, Peyton finally met Monsignor Kelly and was offered a job of becoming the cathedral's [[Sexton (office)|sexton]]. In the words of Peyton at that time, \"a sexton was just another name for a janitor''.\"''\n\nPeyton took the job with initial hesitation but his daily presence at the cathedral brought back the calling for a vocation and he finally decided to pursue the priesthood. Monsignor Kelly insisted that Peyton should complete his high school education prior to admission to the [[novitiate]].  He and his older brother Thomas both pursued their religious vocations while working at the cathedral. During the spring of 1929, Father Pat Dolan of the [[Congregation of Holy Cross]] came to the cathedral in Scranton in search of new seminarians. Peyton and his brother Thomas entered the minor seminary of the Congregation of Holy Cross in [[Notre Dame, Indiana]].<ref name=chc/>\n\nAfter completing their high school studies at the Holy Cross School in [[Notre Dame, Indiana]], Peyton was admitted to the Moreau Seminary within the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1932, where he pursued a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree, and excelled in [[Philosophy]]. He credited Cornelius Hagerty, a professor of ethics, as the one who provided him with counseling. As a young seminarian, Peyton was attracted to become a Holy Cross Father, for the order's focus on the Holy Family and towards obedience and conscience.\n\n==Marian devotion==\n[[File:Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo - Virgin and Child with a Rosary - WGA16360.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Peyton hosted a number of televised shows abroad promoting the [[Rosary]], where an image of [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo]]'s painting of the [[Our Lady of the Rosary]] was always present in the background. Oil on canvas. [[Museo del Prado]].]]\n\nIn October 1938, during Peyton's second year of theology at [[Catholic University of America]], he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He was transferred back to Notre Dame to the Infirmary. Father Cornelius Hagerty was influential in this stage of Peyton's life, encouraging the young seminarian to seek the help of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

Peyton started sending letters to bishops, Catholic laity, and other groups promoting the importance of families praying the Rosary as the war raged on.\n\nUtilizing radio, [[films]], [[outdoor advertising]] and later television, with the help of celebrities, artists and advertising practitioners, Peyton was one of the first pioneers of evangelism using [[mass media]]. He would also pioneer in conducting public rallies to bring families to pledge to pray the Rosary as a unit. These Rosary rallies attended by millions would become the most significant event where Peyton could be best remembered.  According to historian Hugh Wilford, \"Peyton himself was deeply conscious of the political dimension of his mission, proudly proclaiming in a 1946 radio broadcast, 'The rosary is the offensive weapon that will destroy Communism\u2014the great evil that seeks to destroy the faith'\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=GRIBBLE |first1=RICHARD  |date=2003 |title=Anti-Communism, Patrick Peyton, CSC and the C.I.A. |journal=Journal of Church and State |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=535\u2013558 |doi= 10.1093/jcs/45.3.535|jstor=23920511 }}</ref>\n\nThese Rosary Crusades were duplicated in different dioceses with attendees growing in numbers, taking Peyton across the globe from [[Brussels, Belgium]], to [[Madrid, Spain]], across Asia to [[Manila, Philippines]], down south of the [[equator]] to New Zealand and [[Papua New Guinea]] and into several South American cities like [[Lima, Peru]], to [[Rio de Janeiro]] in [[Brazil]]. With the help of a non-Catholic advertising practitioner, Peyton would popularize the slogan, \"The family that prays together stays together.\"\n\n==Death and legacy==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:father patrick peyton rosary rally philippines.gif|left|thumb|350px|Peyton shaking hands with [[Filipinos]] who gathered for the Rosary Rally in [[Archdiocese of Manila|Manila]]. 1953]] -->\n\nWith the [[Cold War]] threatening a new world peace, Peyton's work in promoting prayer was recognized by the Holy See. His efforts earned him the title \"The Rosary Priest\".\n\nControversy hounded Peyton throughout his ministry as some accused him of being a front for American intelligence during his missions in Latin America. Peyton's Rosary Crusades in Latin America were funded and, to some extent, directed by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], which was interested in combating leftist political movements in Latin America.  This came about through Peyton's connection to [[J. Peter Grace]], the great-grandson of the founder of [[W.R. Grace and Company]], a multinational corporation with interests in transport, [[sugar]], and mining in South America, whom Peyton had met in 1946 on a trans-Atlantic voyage.  Grace, who was involved with other [[CIA]] front operations as well, wrote to John Moore, the chair of the Business Advisory Council, and the two men approached [[Allen Dulles]].  Dulles later met with Grace in the White House office of Vice President [[Richard Nixon]], who expressed enthusiasm.  The CIA decided for several years where the crusades would take place, and CIA funds were expended in [[Chile]], [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Colombia]], until Peyton's provincial superior, Richard H. Sullivan, learned of the secret funding from [[Theodore Hesburgh]], the chair of the board of trustees of the [[University of Notre Dame]], in October 1964.  It took the [[Holy See|Vatican]] more than a year and a half to oblige Peyton to give up his CIA financing.<ref>Hugh Wilford, ''The Mighty Wurlitzer: How the CIA Played America'' [Cambridge and London: Harvard University Press, 2008], pp.&nbsp;182\u201396 .</ref> While the CIA determined the locations of the Crusades, it did not influence the content or Peyton's goal of promoting family prayer \u2013 the Rosary and devotion to the Blessed Mother.\n\nOthers accused Peyton of living an ostentatious lifestyle, living a life with Hollywood artists who volunteered their efforts in helping promote his mission. But Peyton maintained that he never solicited funds for his ministry, and the well-off were more than generous to voluntarily donate a portion of their wealth all in the name of the Blessed Mother.\n\nPeyton died peacefully on June 3, 1992, holding a rosary, in a small room at the Little Sisters of the Poor Jeanne Jugan Residence in [[San Pedro, California]]. His remains were brought to the Holy Cross Cemetery on the grounds of [[Stonehill College]] in [[Easton, Massachusetts]].\n\nBefore Peyton died, he continued to work on what was to be the last major Rosary Rally. On December 8, 1992, at the [[Rizal Park]] in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], Manila Archbishop [[Jaime Cardinal Sin]] led the celebrations for the Golden Jubilee Celebration of the [[Family Rosary Crusade]]; the Archbishop of Los Angeles, [[Roger Cardinal Mahony]] was sent as [[Papal Legate]] on behalf of [[Pope John Paul II]]. Among [[Filipino people|Filipino]] Catholics, Peyton is remembered for his Sunday televised shows, where he promoted the [[Rosary]] and [[Marian devotion]] along with his famous slogan. Peyton also encouraged many businesses to start making and selling large amounts of Rosaries for distribution, which he gave freely to impoverished Filipinos living in the slums.\n\nPeyton's work continues today in his original ministries \u2013 Family Rosary, Family Theater and Family Rosary International \u2013 and in the Father Patrick Peyton Family Institute.\n\n==Sainthood==\nCardinal [[Se\u00e1n Patrick O'Malley|Sean Patrick O\u2019Malley]] announced a formal declaration opening the cause for [[sainthood]] of Father Peyton on June 1, 2001, a few days after receiving approval from the Vatican's [[Congregation for the Causes of the Saints]]. The declaration paved the way for the process of determining Peyton's holiness and in the process earning the revered title of \"[[Servant of God]]\".\n\nThe [[Positio]] was sent to the C.C.S. in 2015 for assessment and theologians approved his cause on 1 June 2017. [[Pope Francis]] named him as [[Venerable]] on 18 December 2017.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Citation\n|last=Peyton, CSC\n|first=Patrick\n|title=All For Her: An Autobiography of Father Patrick Peyton, CSC\n|publisher=Family Theater Publications, Hollywood California\n|origyear=1967|year=1996\n|asin= B0006CCAGY\n|url=http://www.christian-pages.com/si/2353.html}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Shiel\n|first=Tom\n|title=Cardinal urges Christians to twitter\n|publisher=Irish Times\n|date=April 27, 2009\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0427/1224245444798.html\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n |last        = Matilla\n |first       = Dexter R.\n |title       = 'Rosary priest' to be honored with sculpture\n |publisher   = Philippines Daily Inquirer\n |date        = March 31, 2009\n |url         = http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20090427-201593/Rosary-priest-to-be-honored-with-sculpture\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090430075846/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20090427-201593/Rosary-priest-to-be-honored-with-sculpture\n |archivedate = April 30, 2009\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Bourke\n|first=Toni\n|title=Fr Peyton remembered at 100th anniversary celebrations\n|publisher=Mayo Advertiser\n|date=April 17, 2009\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/mayo/article/11149\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Schworm\n|first=Peter\n|title=Dozens in Easton pray for canonization of the 'Rosary Priest'\n|work=Boston Globe\n|date=June 8, 2008\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/06/08/dozens_in_easton_pray_for_canonization_of_the_rosary_priest/\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Gribble\n|first=Richard\n|title=Anti-communism, Patrick Peyton, CSC and the C.I.A.(Congregation of Holy Cross)\n|publisher=Journal of Church and State/J.M.

He staged massive [[Rosary]] rallies in key cities of the world and extensively utilized mass communication, helped by world-recognized celebrities of [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] at that time, promoting his ministry of binding families through prayer under the Family Rosary. Peyton was a popular and charismatic figure in [[Latin America]] and the [[Philippines]], where he promoted the [[Rosary]] and was known for his strong [[Irish people|Irish]] accent.\n\nPeyton popularized the phrases \"[[The family that prays together stays together]]\" and \"A world at prayer is a world at peace\".\n\n[[Pope Francis]] furthered Peyton towards sainthood by confirming his [[heroic virtue]] and naming him as [[Venerable]] on December 18, 2017.\n\n==Early life==\nPeyton was born Patrick Joseph Peyton in [[Attymass]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]],<ref name=chc>[http://holycrosscongregation.org/holy-ones/servant-of-god-patrick-peyton/ \"Venerable Patrick Peyton\", Congregation of Holy Cross]</ref> to subsistence-farmers John and Mary Gillard Peyton. Peyton was the sixth in a deeply religious family of four girls and five boys living in a small cottage at a 14-acre (5.66&nbsp;hectares) stony farmland near the foot of the Ox Mountains. Later on, some members of the family migrated to the United States.\n\nPeyton was sent to his mother's relatives in [[Bonniconlon]] to study at a school run by Tadhg O\u2019Leary in Bofield. As a young man, Peyton was rebellious and had moments of defying authority, resulting in dropping out of school. Despite the youthful rebellion, he remained close to his family, and deeply religious.\n\nBy his teen years, he was contemplating a vocation to become a priest. Although religious recruiters such as the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]] and the [[Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer|Redemptorist]] fathers visited Carracastle in search of young men wanting to pursue the priesthood, Peyton concentrated on helping his family earn a living when their father became too ill to work the farm. Some of his elder sisters were already in America and were sending remittances to help the family left in Ireland. In 1927, his sisters sent word that Patrick and his older brother Thomas could sail to the United States and join them in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. On May 13, 1928, the Peyton brothers set sail.\n\n==America==\nThe brothers arrived in [[New York City|New York]] after a 10-day trip, traveling by steerage. The two took the train from New York to [[Pennsylvania]] and lived at the home of their already married sister Beatrice, who was working as a housekeeper for [[Thomas J. Baldrige]], the state Attorney General. Peyton's sister Nellie had already spoken to [[Monsignor]] Paul Kelly of [[St. Peter's Cathedral (Scranton, Pennsylvania)|Saint Peter's Cathedral]] and mentioned Peyton's interest in pursuing a [[Seminary|priestly vocation]]. Monsignor Kelly told Nellie to bring her younger brother Patrick to the cathedral as soon as he arrived. By June 1928, with hard luck in finding a job, Peyton finally met Monsignor Kelly and was offered a job of becoming the cathedral's [[Sexton (office)|sexton]]. In the words of Peyton at that time, \"a sexton was just another name for a janitor''.\"''\n\nPeyton took the job with initial hesitation but his daily presence at the cathedral brought back the calling for a vocation and he finally decided to pursue the priesthood. Monsignor Kelly insisted that Peyton should complete his high school education prior to admission to the [[novitiate]].  He and his older brother Thomas both pursued their religious vocations while working at the cathedral. During the spring of 1929, Father Pat Dolan of the [[Congregation of Holy Cross]] came to the cathedral in Scranton in search of new seminarians. Peyton and his brother Thomas entered the minor seminary of the Congregation of Holy Cross in [[Notre Dame, Indiana]].<ref name=chc/>\n\nAfter completing their high school studies at the Holy Cross School in [[Notre Dame, Indiana]], Peyton was admitted to the Moreau Seminary within the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1932, where he pursued a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree, and excelled in [[Philosophy]]. He credited Cornelius Hagerty, a professor of ethics, as the one who provided him with counseling. As a young seminarian, Peyton was attracted to become a Holy Cross Father, for the order's focus on the Holy Family and towards obedience and conscience.\n\n==Marian devotion==\n[[File:Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo - Virgin and Child with a Rosary - WGA16360.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Peyton hosted a number of televised shows abroad promoting the [[Rosary]], where an image of [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo]]'s painting of the [[Our Lady of the Rosary]] was always present in the background. Oil on canvas. [[Museo del Prado]].]]\n\nIn October 1938, during Peyton's second year of theology at [[Catholic University of America]], he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He was transferred back to Notre Dame to the Infirmary. Father Cornelius Hagerty was influential in this stage of Peyton's life, encouraging the young seminarian to seek the help of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The doctors discovered that the patches in his lungs disappeared.<ref name=chc/>\n\nHe immediately packed his bags and left for Washington, D.C., to complete his theology studies and take his final vows.

Paget had a large force in the region at his disposal and threatened that he would be forced to intervene from the [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] if the violence did not stop. Churchill agreed but needed the backing of the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] in which to send British troops against the French.<ref name=\"Thomas\" />\n\nAt the same time the French [[Army of the Levant]] in the region had been severely weakened\u2014nearly 70 percent of all officers and 40 percent of Syrian soldiers in the French army had deserted their posts and taken up arms with the Syrian rebels. In Hama two French aircraft were downed, while the commander of a French unit was ambushed and killed. In [[Hauran]] French troops were rounded up disarmed\u2014their weapons distributed to young men hoping to march towards Damascus to help the central government.{{sfn|Moubayed|2012|p=63}} The French then called in for reinforcements and were now using their air force to drop bombs on suspected areas of resistance. At the same time the Syrian Prime Minister [[Faris al-Khoury]] was at the founding conference of the [[United Nations]] in [[San Francisco]], presenting Syria's claim for independence and also ordered the fighting to stop. They were both backed by President [[Harry Truman]], who declared \"those French ought to be taken out and castrated\".<ref>Jonathan Fenby: ''The General: Charles de Gaulle and the France He Saved'', Skyhorse, New York 2012, p. 288.</ref>\n\n===British intervention===\nFinally, on 31 May, with news that the casualty toll had exceeded a thousand Syrians, Churchill sent de Gaulle a message saying, \"In order to avoid a collision between British and French forces, we request you immediately order French troops to cease fire and withdraw to their barracks\". This was ignored and Churchill the next day without waiting for a response from the Americans authorised Paget to invade.<ref name=\"Wall\" />\n\nOn 1 June Paget ordered his force to invade Syria from Transjordan, with troops and tanks of the [[31st Indian Armoured Division]].<ref name=\"Brecher&Wilkenfeld\">Brecher & Wilkenfeld, pp. 420\u2013421</ref> They struck towards Damascus with 'D' Squadron of the [[1st King's Dragoon Guards|Kings Dragoon Guards]] having rolled into [[Beirut]] from which they cut the communications of Oliva-Roget. Paget ordered Oliva-Roget to tell his men to cease fire, but the Frenchman said that he would not take orders from the British even though Paget was his superior officer and Commander of [[Middle East Command]]. Paget then advanced towards Damascus; eventually and having realised he was heavily outnumbered, Roget ordered his men back to their base near the coast. He was angry that the British had arrived only after he had \"restored order\".

French soldiers were kept in their barracks and were not allowed to shoot except in self-defence under the watchful eyes of British guns.

On 10 July ''Mannforce'', together with the 2nd [[Sherwood Foresters]], were called to [[Baniyas]] when the French opened fire on the town with mortars and machine guns. With control restored there Lieutenant Mann then took a party to the Turkish frontier to bring back the horses and French officers of their Cavalry unit, whose men had deserted.

There were accusations in the French press that Britain had armed the demonstrators and that Britain was an enemy of France having made another example of herself as [[Perfidious Albion|''perfide albion'']]. They also accused the United States of helping Italy and Germany more than it helped France during the war.
