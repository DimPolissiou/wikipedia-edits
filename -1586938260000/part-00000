She was previously married and widowed before marrying Beria's father, Pavel Khukhaevich Beria (1872\u20131922), a landowner from [[Abkhazia]].{{sfn|Knight|1996|p=14-16}} Beria also had a brother (name unknown), and a [[deaf]] sister named Anna.\n\nIn his autobiography, Lavrentiy Beria mentioned only his sister and his niece, implying that his brother was (or any other siblings were) dead or had no relationship with Beria after he left Merkheuli. Beria attended a technical school in Sukhumi, and joined the [[Bolshevik]]s in March 1917 while a student in the [[Baku Polytechnicum]] (subsequently known as the [[Azerbaijan State Oil Academy]]). As a student, Beria distinguished himself in mathematics and the sciences. The Polytechnicum's curriculum concentrated on the [[petroleum industry]].\n\nBeria also worked for the anti-Bolshevik [[Mussavatist]]s in [[Baku]]. After the [[Red Army]] captured the city on 28 April 1920, Beria was saved from execution because there was not enough time to arrange his shooting and replacement, and [[Sergei Kirov]] possibly intervened.<ref>{{Cite book|first = Svetlana|last = Alliluyeva|title = Twenty Letters to a Friend|publisher=Hutchinson|year=1967|page = 138}}</ref> While in prison, he formed a connection with Nina Gegechkori (1905\u201310 June 1991)<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sXJEF6HHyH0C&pg=PA20&dq=\u041d\u0438\u043d\u043e+\u0422\u0435\u0439\u043c\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430+\u0413\u0435\u0433\u0435\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0438#v=onepage|title=\u0421\u0430\u043c\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438|authors=\u041c\u0456\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0410\u043b\u044f\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0456\u0447 \u0417\u044f\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0447, \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0417\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|publisher=\u041e\u041b\u041c\u0410 \u041c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0430 \u0413\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f|year=2005|isbn=9785948504087}}</ref> his cellmate's niece, and they eloped on a train.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Jrkl5e1joNMC|title=Young Stalin|year=2008|last=Montefiore|first=Simon|isbn=9781400096138|publisher=Vintage|location=New York|page=67|oclc=276996699}}</ref> She was 17, a trained scientist from an aristocratic family.\n\n[[File:\u041b\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0439 \u0411\u0435\u0440\u0438\u044f, 1920-\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u044b.jpg|thumb|Lavrentiy Beria in the 1920s]]\nIn 1919, at the age of twenty, Beria started his career in [[state security]] when the security service of the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] hired him while still a student at the Polytechnicum. In 1920 or 1921 (accounts vary) Beria joined the [[Cheka]], the original Bolshevik [[secret police]]. At that time, a Bolshevik revolt took place in the [[Menshevik]]-controlled [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]], and the Red Army subsequently [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|invaded]]. The Cheka became heavily involved in the conflict, which resulted in the defeat of the Mensheviks and the formation of the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgian SSR]]. By 1922, Beria was deputy head of the Georgian branch of Cheka's successor, the [[State Political Directorate|OGPU]].\n\nIn 1924, he led the repression of a [[August Uprising|Georgian nationalist uprising]], after which up to 10,000 people were executed. For this display of \"Bolshevik ruthlessness,\" Beria was appointed head of the \"secret-political division\" of the [[South Caucasus|Transcaucasian]] OGPU and was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner]].\n\nIn 1926, Beria became head of the Georgian OGPU; [[Sergo Ordzhonikidze]], head of the Transcaucasian party, introduced him to fellow-Georgian Iosef Dzhughashvili, later known as [[Joseph Stalin]]. As a result, Beria became an ally in Stalin's rise to power. During his years at the helm of the Georgian OGPU, Beria effectively destroyed the intelligence networks that [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]] had developed in the Soviet Caucasus, while successfully penetrating the governments of these countries with his agents. He also took over Stalin's holiday security.\n\n[[File:Makharadze, Mir-Jafar Bagirov, Beria.jpg|thumb|left|Beria on Caucasian [[CPSU|Party]] caucus, 1935. Left to right: [[Filipp Makharadze]], [[Mir Jafar Baghirov]], Beria.]]\n\nBeria was appointed Secretary of the Communist Party in Georgia in 1931, and for the whole Transcaucasian region in 1932. He became a member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1934. During this time, he began to attack fellow members of the Georgian Communist Party, particularly [[Gaioz Devdariani]], who served as Minister of Education of the Georgian SSR. Beria ordered the executions of Devdariani's brothers George and Shalva, who held important positions in the Cheka and the Communist Party respectively.\n\nHe reportedly won Stalin's favour in the early 1930s, after faking a conspiracy to assassinate the Soviet leader that he then claimed to have foiled. By 1935, Beria had become one of Stalin's most trusted subordinates. He cemented his place in Stalin's entourage with a lengthy oration titled, \"On the History of the Bolshevik Organisations in Transcaucasia\" (later published as a book), which emphasised Stalin's role.{{sfn|Knight|1996|p=57}} When Stalin's purge of the Communist Party and government began in 1934 after the assassination of [[Leningrad]] party boss [[Sergei Kirov]] (1 December 1934), Beria ran the purges in Transcaucasia. He used the opportunity to settle many old scores in the politically turbulent Transcaucasian republics.\n\nIn June 1937, he said in a speech, \"Let our enemies know that anyone who attempts to raise a hand against the will of our people, against the will of the party of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and Stalin, will be mercilessly crushed and destroyed.\"<ref>{{harvnb|\u0417\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|2000}} cited by [http://www.hrono.ru/biograf/beria.html \u0411\u0435\u0440\u0438\u044f \u041b\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0439 \u041f\u0430\u0432\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447], biographical index, editor Vyacheslav Rumyantsev</ref>\n\n== Head of the NKVD ==\n\n[[File:Katyn - decision of massacre p1.jpg|thumb|The first page of Beria's notice (oversigned by Stalin), to kill approximately 15,000 Polish officers and some 10,000 more intellectuals in the [[Katyn massacre|Katyn Forest]] and other places in the Soviet Union]]\n[[File:Khrushchyov, Beria and Khanjian.jpg|thumb|[[Nestor Lakoba]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]], Lavrenti Beria and [[Aghasi Khanjian]] during the opening of the [[Moscow Metro]] in 1936.

Under [[Nikolai Yezhov]], the NKVD carried out the [[Great Purge]]: the imprisonment or execution of millions of people throughout the Soviet Union as alleged \"[[enemy of the people|enemies of the people]].\" By 1938, however, the oppression had become so extensive that it was damaging the infrastructure, economy and even the armed forces of the Soviet state, prompting Stalin to wind the purge down. Stalin had voted to appoint [[Georgy Malenkov]] as head of the NKVD, but he was over-ruled.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} In September, Beria was appointed head of the Main Administration of State Security (GUGB) of the NKVD, and in November he succeeded Yezhov as NKVD head. Yezhov was executed in 1940 and one account says he was personally strangled by Beria.<ref>{{cite news|title=Stalin's depraved executioner still has grip on Moscow |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/1450145/Stalins-depraved-executioner-still-has-grip-on-Moscow.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=23 December 2003|last1=Strauss|first1=Julius}}</ref> The NKVD was purged next, with half of its personnel replaced by Beria loyalists, many of them from the [[Caucasus]].\n\nAlthough Beria's name is closely identified with the Great Purge because of his activities while deputy head of the NKVD, his leadership of the organisation marked an easing of the repression begun under Yezhov. Over 100,000 people were released from the labour camps. The government officially admitted that there had been some injustice and \"excesses\" during the purges, which were blamed entirely on Yezhov. The liberalisation was only relative: arrests and executions continued, and in 1940, as war approached, the pace of the purges again accelerated. During this period, Beria supervised deportations of people identified as political enemies from Poland and the [[Baltic states]] after Soviet occupation of those regions.\n\nIn March 1939, Beria became a candidate member of the Communist Party's [[Politburo]]. Although he did not become a full member until 1946, he was already one of the senior leaders of the Soviet state. In 1941, Beria was made a Commissar General of State Security, the highest quasi-military rank within the Soviet police system of that time, effectively comparable to a [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]].\n\nOn 5 March 1940, after the [[Gestapo\u2013NKVD Conferences|Gestapo\u2013NKVD Third Conference]] was held in [[Zakopane]], Beria sent a note (no. 794/B) to Stalin in which he stated that the Polish prisoners of war kept at camps and prisons in western Belarus and Ukraine were enemies of the Soviet Union, and recommended their execution.<ref>Rotfeld, Adam Daniel; Torkunov, Anatoly. \"White Spots\u2014Black Spots: Difficult Matters in Polish-Russian Relations, 1918\u20132008\". University of Pittsburgh Press, 2015</ref> Most of them were military officers, but there were also intelligentsia, doctors, priests, and others in a total of 22,000 people. With Stalin's approval, Beria's NKVD executed them in what became known as the [[Katyn massacre]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nFrom October 1940 to February 1942, the NKVD under Beria carried out a [[Purge of the Red Army in 1941|new purge]] of the Red Army and related industries. In February 1941, Beria became [[Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|Deputy chairman]] of the [[Council of People's Commissars]], and in June, following [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union]], he became a member of the [[State Defense Committee]] (GKO). During [[World War II]], he took on major domestic responsibilities and mobilised the millions of people imprisoned in NKVD Gulag camps into wartime production. He took control of the manufacture of armaments, and (with [[Georgy Malenkov]]) aircraft and aircraft engines. This was the beginning of Beria's alliance with Malenkov, which later became of central importance.\n\nIn 1944, as the Germans were driven from Soviet soil, Beria was in charge of dealing with the various ethnic minorities accused of anti-sovietism and/or collaboration with the invaders, including the [[Balkars]], [[Karachays]], [[Chechen people|Chechens]], [[Ingush people|Ingush]], [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Kalmyks]], [[Greeks in Kazakhstan|Pontic Greeks]], and [[Volga Germans]].<ref>{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=SnLANpCfDn4C&printsec=frontcover | page = 122|title =Ethnic Cleansing in the USSR, 1937\u20131949|isbn = 9780313309212|last1=Pohl|first1 = Jonathan Otto|year = 1999|publisher=Greenwood press|location=Westport, Connecticut|oclc=40158950}}</ref> All these groups were deported to [[Soviet Central Asia]] (see \"[[Population transfer in the Soviet Union]]\").\n\nIn December 1944, Beria's NKVD was assigned to supervise the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]] (\"Task No. 1\"), which built and tested a bomb by 29 August 1949. The project was extremely labour-intensive. At least 330,000 people, including 10,000 technicians, were involved. The [[Gulag]] system provided tens of thousands of people for work in [[uranium]] mines and for the construction and operation of uranium processing plants. They also constructed test facilities, such as those at [[Semipalatinsk Test Site|Semipalatinsk]] and in the [[Novaya Zemlya]] archipelago. The NKVD also ensured the necessary security for the project.\n\nIn July 1945, as Soviet police ranks were converted to a military uniform system, Beria's rank was officially converted to that of [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]]. Although he had never held a traditional military command, Beria made a significant contribution to the victory of the Soviet Union in World War II through his organisation of wartime production and his use of partisans. Stalin personally never thought much of it, and neither commented publicly on his performance nor awarded him recognition (i.e. [[Order of Victory]]), as he did for most other Soviet Marshals.\n\nAbroad, Beria had met with [[Kim Il-sung]], the future leader of [[North Korea]], several times when the Soviet troops had declared war on Japan and occupied the northern half of Korea from August 1945. Beria recommended that Stalin install a communist leader in the occupied territories.<ref>[http://ysfine.com/wisdom/wk01.html Beria/Kim Il-sung] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528043524/http://ysfine.com/wisdom/wk01.html |date=28 May 2013 }}</ref><ref name=\"scmp.com\">{{cite web|author=Mark O&#039;Neill |url=http://www.scmp.com/article/727755/kim-il-sungs-secret-history |title=Kim Il-sung's secret history |work=South China Morning Post |accessdate=15 April 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227095258/http://www.scmp.com/article/727755/kim-il-sungs-secret-history |archivedate=27 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\n== Post-war politics ==\n\n[[File:Lavrenti Beria Stalins family.jpg|thumb|300px|Beria with Stalin (in background), Stalin's daughter [[Svetlana Alliluyeva|Svetlana]], and [[Nestor Lakoba]] (obscured)<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/geschichte/article124705617/Als-Sotschi-das-Zentrum-des-Terrors-war.html|title= Ferien mit Stalin: Als Sotschi das Zentrum des Terrors war|author= Berthold Seewald|newspaper=[[Die Welt]]|language=German|access-date=6 September 2015|date= 10 February 2014}}</ref>]]\n\nWith Stalin nearing 70, a concealed struggle for succession amongst his entourage dominated Kremlin politics in the post-war years. At the end of the war, [[Andrei Zhdanov]] seemed the most likely candidate. Zhdanov had served as the Communist Party leader in Leningrad during the war, and by 1946 had charge of all cultural matters. After 1946, Beria formed an alliance with Malenkov to counter Zhdanov's rise.{{sfn|Knight|1996|p=143}}\n\nIn January 1946, Beria resigned as chief of the NKVD while retaining general control over national security matters as Deputy Prime Minister and Curator of the Organs of State Security under Stalin. However, the new NKVD chief, [[Sergei Kruglov (politician)|Sergei Kruglov]], was not a Beria man. Also, by the summer of 1946, Beria's man [[Vsevolod Nikolayevich Merkulov]] was replaced as head of the [[Ministry for State Security (Soviet Union)|Ministry for State Security (MGB)]] by [[Viktor Semyonovich Abakumov|Viktor Abakumov]]. Abakumov had headed [[SMERSH]] from 1943 to 1946; his relationship with Beria involved close collaboration (since Abakumov owed his rise to Beria's support and esteem), but also rivalry. Stalin had begun to encourage Abakumov to form his own network inside the MGB to counter Beria's dominance of the power ministries.{{sfn|Parrish|1996}} Kruglov and Abakumov moved expeditiously to replace Beria's men in the security apparatus leadership with new people. Very soon, Deputy Minister Stepan Mamulov of the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs was the only close Beria ally left outside foreign intelligence, on which Beria kept a grip. In the following months, Abakumov started carrying out important operations without consulting Beria, often working in tandem with Zhdanov, and on Stalin's direct orders. These operations were aimed by Stalin\u2014initially tangentially, but with time more directly\u2013at Beria.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nOne of the first such moves involved the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]] affair, which commenced in October 1946 and eventually led to the murder of [[Solomon Mikhoels]] and the arrest of many other members. This affair damaged Beria; not only had he championed the creation of the committee in 1942, but his own entourage included a substantial number of Jews.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nAfter Zhdanov died suddenly in August 1948, Beria and Malenkov consolidated their power by means of a purge of Zhdanov's associates in the so-called \"[[Leningrad Affair]]\". Those executed included Zhdanov's deputy, [[Alexey Kuznetsov]]; the economic chief, [[Nikolai Voznesensky]]; the Party head in Leningrad, Pyotr Popkov; and the Prime Minister of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Republic]], [[Mikhail Rodionov]].{{sfn|Knight|1996|p=151}}\n\nDuring the postwar years, Beria supervised installation of Communist regimes in the countries of Eastern Europe and hand-picked the Soviet-backed leaders.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 10 Odd Facts about Stalin|url=http://mixtopten.com/top-10-odd-facts-about-stalin-and-his-death/|website=Mix Top Ten|accessdate=6 August 2014|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810052437/http://mixtopten.com/top-10-odd-facts-about-stalin-and-his-death/|archivedate=10 August 2014}}</ref> Starting in 1948, Abakumov initiated several investigations against these leaders, which culminated with the arrest in November 1951 of [[Rudolf Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd]], [[Bed\u0159ich Geminder]], and others in [[Czechoslovakia]]. These men were frequently accused of [[Zionism]], \"[[rootless cosmopolitan]]ism\", and providing weapons to Israel. Such charges deeply disturbed Beria, as he had directly ordered the sale of large amounts of Czech arms to Israel. Altogether, 14 Czechoslovak Communist leaders, 11 of them Jewish, were tried, convicted, and executed (see [[Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd trial]]). Similar investigations in Poland and other Soviet satellite countries occurred at the same time.\n\nIn 1951, Abakumov was replaced by [[Semyon Ignatyev]], who further intensified the anti-Semitic campaign. On 13 January 1953, the biggest anti-semitic affair in the Soviet Union started with an article in ''[[Pravda]]'' \u2013 it began what became known as the [[Doctors' plot]], in which a number of the country's prominent Jewish physicians were accused of poisoning top Soviet leaders and arrested. Concurrently, the Soviet press began an anti-semitic propaganda campaign, euphemistically termed the \"struggle against rootless cosmopolitanism\". Initially, 37 men were arrested, but the number quickly grew into hundreds. Scores of Soviet Jews were dismissed from their jobs, arrested, sent to the Gulag, or executed. The \"Doctors' plot\" was presumably invented by Stalin as an excuse to dismiss Beria and replace him with Ignatiev or some other MGB functionary. A few days after Stalin's death on 5 March 1953, Beria freed all the arrested doctors, announced that the entire matter was fabricated, and arrested the MGB functionaries directly involved.\n\nIn other international issues, Beria (along with [[Anastas Mikoyan|Mikoyan]]) correctly foresaw the victory (1949\u20131950) of [[Mao Zedong]] in the [[Chinese Civil War]] and greatly helped the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]] by letting them use Soviet-occupied [[Manchuria]] as a staging area and arranging large weapons shipments to the [[People's Liberation Army]], mainly from the recently captured equipment of the Japanese [[Kwantung Army]].{{sfn|Chang|Halliday|2005|}}{{page needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Sexual predator==\nAt Beria's trial in 1953, it became known that he had committed numerous rapes during the years he was NKVD chief.<ref>{{cite book|first=Donald|last=Rayfield|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yi3ow3TU8-4C&pg=RA10-PT11|title=Stalin and His Hangmen: The Tyrant and Those Who Killed for Him|publisher=[[Random House]]|location=New York City|date=2005|isbn=978-0-375-75771-6|pages=466\u2013467}}</ref> [[Simon Sebag-Montefiore]], a biographer of Stalin, concluded the information \"reveals a sexual predator who used his power to indulge himself in obsessive depravity.\"{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=506}} After his death, charges of sexual abuse and rape were disputed by people close to him including his wife Nina and his son Sergo.{{sfn||Sudoplatov|1995|p=97}}\n\nHis case files in the Soviet archives contained the official testimony from Colonel Rafael Semyonovich Sarkisov and Colonel Sardion Nikolaevich Nadaraia, two of Beria's most senior NKVD bodyguards. They stated that, on warm nights during the war years, Beria was often driven slowly through the streets of Moscow in his armoured [[Packard]] limousine. He would point out young women to be detained and escorted to his mansion, where wine and a feast awaited them. After dining, Beria would take the women into his soundproofed office and rape them. Beria's bodyguards reported that their duties included handing each victim a flower bouquet as she left Beria's house. Accepting it implied that the sex had been consensual; refusal would mean arrest. In one incident, his chief bodyguard, Sarkisov, reported that a woman who had been brought to Beria rejected his advances and ran out of his office; Sarkisov mistakenly handed her the flowers anyway, prompting the enraged Beria to declare, \"Now it's not a bouquet, it's a wreath! May it rot on your grave!\" The NKVD arrested the woman the next day.{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=506}}\n\nWomen also submitted to Beria's sexual advances in exchange for the promise of freeing their relatives from the Gulag. In one case, Beria picked up [[Tatiana Okunevskaya]], a well-known Soviet actress, under the pretence of bringing her to perform for the [[Politburo]]. Instead he took her to his dacha, where he offered to free her father and grandmother from NKVD prison if she submitted. He then raped her, telling her: \"Scream or not, it doesn't matter.\"{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=507}} Beria, however, already knew that her relatives had been executed months earlier. Okunevskaya was arrested shortly afterwards and sentenced to [[solitary confinement]] in the Gulag, which she survived.\n\nBeria's sexually predatory nature was well known to the Politburo, and though Stalin took an indulgent viewpoint (considering Beria's wartime importance), he said, \"I don't trust Beria.\" In one instance, when Stalin learned his daughter [[Svetlana Stalin|Svetlana]] was alone with Beria at his house, he telephoned her and told her to leave immediately. When Beria complimented [[Alexander Poskrebyshev]]'s daughter on her beauty, Poskrebyshev quickly pulled her aside and instructed her, \"Don't ever accept a lift from Beria.\"{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=508}} After taking an interest in Marshal [[Kliment Voroshilov]]'s daughter-in-law during a party at their summer dacha, Beria shadowed their car closely all the way back to the Kremlin, terrifying Voroshilov's wife.\n\nPrior to and during the war, Beria directed Sarkisov to keep a running list of the names and phone numbers of his sexual encounters. Eventually, he ordered Sarkisov to destroy the list as a security risk, but the colonel retained a secret handwritten copy. When Beria's fall from power began, Sarkisov passed the list to [[Viktor Abakumov]], the former wartime head of [[SMERSH]] and now chief of the [[Ministry for State Security (Soviet Union)|MGB]] \u2013 the successor to the NKVD. Abakumov was already aggressively building a case against Beria. Stalin, who was also seeking to undermine Beria, was thrilled by the detailed records kept by Sarkisov, demanding: \"Send me everything this asshole writes down!\"{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=507}} Sarkisov reported that Beria's sexual appetite had led to him contracting [[syphilis]] during the war, for which he was secretly treated without the knowledge of Stalin or the Politburo (a fact Beria later admitted during his interrogation).{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=537}} Although the Russian government acknowledged Sarkisov's handwritten list of Beria's victims on 17 January 2003, the victims' names will not be released until 2028.\n\nEvidence suggests that not only did Beria abduct and rape women, but that some were also murdered. His villa in Moscow is now the Tunisian Embassy (at {{nowrap|{{coord|55|45|34|N|37|35|10|E|scale:10000_type:landmark_region:RU|display=inline|name=The former residence of Lavrentiy Beria in Moscow}}}}).

According to historian [[Amy Knight]], \"Smith noted that Beria's escapades were common knowledge among embassy personnel because his house was on the same street as a residence for Americans, and those who lived there saw girls brought to Beria's house late at night in a limousine.\"{{sfn|Knight|1996|p=97}}\n\n== Stalin's death ==\nKhrushchev wrote in his memoirs that Beria had, immediately after Stalin's stroke, gone about \"spewing hatred against [Stalin] and mocking him.\" When Stalin showed signs of consciousness, Beria dropped to his knees and kissed his hand. When Stalin fell unconscious again, Beria immediately stood and spat.{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=571}} Stalin's aide Vasili Lozgachev reported that Beria and Malenkov were the first members of the Politburo to see Stalin's condition when he was found unconscious. They arrived at Stalin's dacha at Kuntsevo at 03:00 on 2 March, after being called by Khrushchev and Bulganin. The latter two did not want to risk Stalin's wrath by checking themselves.{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=639}} Lozgachev tried to explain to Beria that the unconscious Stalin (still in his soiled clothing) was \"sick and needed medical attention.\" Beria angrily dismissed his claims as panic-mongering and quickly left, ordering him, \"Don't bother us, don't cause a panic and don't disturb Comrade Stalin!\"{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=605}} Calling a doctor was deferred for a full 12 hours after Stalin was rendered paralysed, incontinent and unable to speak. This decision is noted as \"extraordinary\" by the historian Simon Sebag-Montefiore but also consistent with the standard Stalinist policy of deferring all decision-making (no matter how necessary or obvious) without official orders from higher authority.{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=640-44}}\n\nBeria's decision to avoid immediately calling a doctor was tacitly supported (or at least not opposed) by the rest of the Politburo, which was rudderless without Stalin's micromanagement and paralysed by a legitimate fear he would suddenly recover and take reprisals on anyone who had dared to act without his orders.{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=638-41}} Stalin's suspicion of doctors in the wake of the [[Doctors' Plot]] was well known at the time of his sickness; his private physician was already being tortured in the basement of the [[Lubyanka Building|Lubyanka]] for suggesting the leader required more bed rest.{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=640}}\n\nAfter Stalin's death, Beria claimed to have killed him. This aborted a final purge of [[Old Bolsheviks]] [[Anastas Mikoyan|Mikoyan]] and [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]], for which Stalin had been laying the groundwork in the year prior to his death. Shortly after Stalin's death, Beria announced triumphantly to the Politburo that he had \"done [Stalin] in\" and \"saved [us] all\", according to Molotov's memoirs. The assertion that Stalin was poisoned by Beria's associates has been supported by [[Edvard Radzinsky]] and other authors.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.surgicalneurologyint.com/article.asp?issn=2152-7806;year=2011;volume=2;issue=1;spage=161;epage=161;aulast=Faria |last=Faria|first=Miguel|year=2011 |title=Stalin's mysterious death |journal=Surgical Neurology International |issn=2152-7806 |volume=2 |issue=1 |page=161 |doi=10.4103/2152-7806.89876 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425121806/http://www.surgicalneurologyint.com/article.asp?issn=2152-7806%3Byear%3D2011%3Bvolume%3D2%3Bissue%3D1%3Bspage%3D161%3Bepage%3D161%3Baulast%3DFaria |archivedate=25 April 2012 |pmc=3228382 |pmid=22140646}}</ref>{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=640}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Naumov|first1=Vladimir|last2=Brent|first2=Jonathan |title=Stalin's Last Crime: The Plot Against the Jewish Doctors, 1948\u20131953 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |year=2003 |isbn=0-06-019524-X}}</ref><ref>Faria, Miguel A.

In the uneasy silence following the cessation of Stalin's last agonies, Beria was the first to dart forward to kiss his lifeless form (a move likened by Sebag-Montefiore to \"wrenching a dead King's ring off his finger\".){{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=649}} While the rest of Stalin's inner circle (even Molotov, saved from certain liquidation) stood sobbing unashamedly over the body, Beria reportedly appeared \"radiant\", \"regenerated\" and \"glistening with ill-concealed relish.\"{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=649}} When Beria left the room, he broke the somber atmosphere by shouting loudly for his driver, his voice echoing with what Stalin's daughter [[Svetlana Alliluyeva]] called \"the ring of triumph unconcealed.\"{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=650}} Alliluyeva noticed how the Politburo seemed openly frightened of Beria and unnerved by his bold display of ambition. \"He's off to take power,\" Mikoyan recalled muttering to Khrushchev. That prompted a \"frantic\" dash for their own limousines to intercept him at the Kremlin.{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=650}}\n\n== First Deputy Premier and Soviet triumvir ==\nAfter Stalin's death, Beria was appointed [[First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|First Deputy Premier]] and reappointed head of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Soviet Union)|MVD]], which he merged with the MGB. His close ally Malenkov was the new [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Prime Minister]] and initially the most powerful man in the post-Stalin leadership. Beria was second most powerful, and given Malenkov's personal weakness, was poised to become the power behind the throne and ultimately leader himself. Khrushchev became Party Secretary. [[Kliment Voroshilov|Voroshilov]] became Chairman of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] (i.e., the head of state).\n\nBeria undertook some measures of liberalisation immediately after Stalin's death.{{sfn|Knight|1996|p=184}} He reorganised the MVD and drastically reduced its economic power and penal responsibilities. A number of costly construction projects such as the [[Salekhard\u2013Igarka Railway]] were scrapped, and the remaining industrial enterprises became affiliated under corresponding economic ministries.{{sfn|Kozlov|Gilburd|2013|p=111}} The Gulag system was transferred to the [[Ministry of Justice (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Justice]], and a mass release of over a million prisoners, almost half of the Gulag personnel, was announced, although political prisoners were excluded.{{sfn|Kozlov|Gilburd|2013|p=112}} The amnesty, however, led to a substantial increase in crime and would later be used against Beria by his rivals.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hardy |first1=Jeffrey S. |title=The Gulag After Stalin: Redefining Punishment in Khrushchev's Soviet Union, 1953\u20131964 |date=2016 |publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] |location=Ithaca, New York |isbn=9781501706042 |pages=23\u201324}}</ref>{{sfn|Kozlov|Gilburd|2013|p=114}}\n\nTo consolidate power, Beria also took steps to recognise the rights of non-Russian nationalities. He questioned the traditional policy of Russification and encouraged local officials to assert their own identities. He first turned to Georgia, where Stalin's fabricated [[Mingrelian affair]] was called off and the republic's key posts were replaced by pro-Beria Georgians.{{sfn|Knight|1996|p=187}} Beria's policies in Ukraine alarmed Khrushchev, for whom Ukraine was a power base. Khrushchev then tried to draw Malenkov to his side, warning that \"Beria is sharpening his knives\".{{sfn|Knight|1996|p=190}}\n\nKhrushchev opposed the alliance between Beria and Malenkov but he was initially unable to challenge them. Khrushchev's opportunity came in June 1953 when a spontaneous [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprising]] against the East German Communist regime broke out in [[East Berlin]]. Based on Beria's statements, other leaders suspected that in the wake of the uprising, he might be willing to trade the reunification of Germany and the end of the [[Cold War]] for massive aid from the United States, as had been received in World War II. The cost of the war still weighed heavily on the Soviet economy. Beria craved the vast financial resources that another (more sustained) relationship with the United States could provide. Beria gave [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] serious prospects of national autonomy, possibly similarly to other Soviet [[satellite state]]s in Europe.<ref>{{cite book |title=Communism and the Emergence of Democracy |first=Harald |last=Wydra |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge, England|year=2007 |isbn=978-0-521-85169-5 |page=165}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Cold War: a new history |first=John Lewis |last=Gaddis |authorlink=John Lewis Gaddis |publisher=[[Penguin Press]] |location=New York City |year=2005 |isbn=1-59420-062-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/coldwarnewhistor00gadd }}</ref>{{sfn|Knight|1996|p=189}} Beria said of East Germany \"It's not even a real state but one kept in being only by Soviet troops.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.history.co.uk/article/historys-forgotten-people-lavrentiy-beria|title=History's forgotten people: Lavrentiy Beria|website=[[History Channel|History.com]]|accessdate=19 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|East German uprising]] convinced [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]], Malenkov, and [[Nikolai Bulganin]] that Beria's policies were dangerous and destabilising to Soviet power. Within days of the events in Germany, Khrushchev persuaded the other leaders to support a Party ''[[coup d'etat|coup]]'' against Beria; Beria's principal ally Malenkov abandoned him.\n\n== Arrest, trial and execution ==\n[[File:Lavrenty Beria-TIME-1953.jpg|right|thumb|Lavrenty Beria on [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] cover in 1953]]\nBeria was chairman of the Council of Ministers and a influential Politburo member and saw himself as Stalin's successor, while wider Politburo members had contrasting thoughts on future leadership. On 26 June 1953, Beria was arrested and held in an undisclosed location near Moscow. Accounts of Beria's fall vary considerably. By the most likely account, Khrushchev prepared an elaborate ambush, convening a meeting of the Presidium on 26 June, where he suddenly launched a scathing attack on Beria, accusing him of being a traitor and spy in the pay of British intelligence. Beria was taken completely by surprise. He asked, \"What's going on, Nikita Sergeyevich? Why are you picking fleas in my trousers?\" Molotov and others quickly spoke against Beria one after the other, followed by a motion by Khrushchev for his instant dismissal.\n\nWhen Beria finally realised what was happening and plaintively appealed to Malenkov to speak for him, his old friend and crony silently hung his head and refused to meet his gaze. Malenkov pressed a button on his desk as the pre-arranged signal to Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]] and a group of armed officers in a nearby room who burst in and arrested Beria.{{refn|group=note|This fits an account from Khrushchev's perspective.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Andrew|first1 = Christopher|author1-link = Christopher Andrew (historian)|first2 = Oleg|last2 = Gordievsky|title = KGB: The Inside Story|edition = 1st|year = 1990|publisher = HarperCollins Publishers|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 0-06-016605-3|pages = [https://archive.org/details/kgbinsidestoryof00chri/page/423 423\u201324]|chapter = 11|chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/kgbinsidestoryof00chri/page/423}}</ref>}}\n\nBeria was taken first to the Moscow [[Military prison|guardhouse]] and then to the [[bunker]] of the headquarters of [[Moscow Military District]].

''[[Pravda]]'' did not announce Beria's arrest until 10 July, crediting it to Malenkov and referring to Beria's \"criminal activities against the Party and the State.\"\n\nBeria and the others were tried by a \"special court presence\" ({{lang|ru|\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435}}) of the [[Supreme Court of the Soviet Union]] on 23 December 1953 with no defence counsel and no right of appeal. Marshal [[Ivan Konev]] was the chairman of the court.\n\nBeria was found guilty of:\n# [[Treason]]. It was alleged that he had maintained secret connections with foreign intelligence services. In particular, attempts to initiate peace talks with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] in 1941 through the ambassador of the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] were classified as treason, though Beria had been acting on the orders of Stalin and Molotov. It was also alleged that Beria, who in 1942 helped organise [[Battle of the Caucasus|the defence of the North Caucasus]], tried to let the Germans occupy the Caucasus. Beria's suggestion to his assistants that to improve foreign relations it was reasonable to transfer the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] to Germany, [[Karelian question in Finnish politics|part of Karelia]] to Finland, the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]] to [[Communist Romania|Romania]] and the [[Kuril Islands]] to Japan also formed part of the allegations against him.\n# [[Terrorism]]. Beria's participation in the [[Purge of the Red Army in 1941]] was classified as an act of terrorism.\n# Counter-revolutionary activity during the [[Russian Civil War]]. In 1919 Beria worked in the security service of the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]]. Beria maintained that he was assigned to that work by the [[Muslim Social Democratic Party|Hummet]] party, which subsequently merged with the Adalat Party, the [[Ahrar Party (Azerbaijan)|Ahrar Party]], and the [[Baku]] Bolsheviks to establish the [[Azerbaijan Communist Party]].\n\nBeria and all the other defendants were sentenced to death on 23 December 1953.

Although banned in the Soviet Union for its semi-allegorical critique of [[Stalinism]], it premiered at the [[1987 Cannes Film Festival]], winning the [[FIPRESCI]] Prize, [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prize of the Jury]], and the [[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/432/year/1987.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Repentance |accessdate=19 July 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\nBritish actor [[Bob Hoskins]] played Beria in the 1991 film ''[[The Inner Circle (1991 film)|Inner Circle]]'' and, with an Irish accent, by [[David Suchet]] in ''[[Red Monarch]]''.

G. Marshall]]. In the 1992 HBO movie [[Stalin_(1992_film)|Stalin]], [[Roshan Seth]] was cast as Beria.\n\nBeria appears in the third episode (\"Superbomb\") of the four-part 2007 BBC docudrama series ''[[Nuclear Secrets]]'', played by [[Boris Isarov]]. In the 2008 BBC documentary series ''[[World War II: Behind Closed Doors]]'', Beria was portrayed by Polish actor {{ill|Krzysztof Dracz|pl}}.\n\nHe was also an important character in the 2013 Russian mini-series ''Kill Stalin'', produced by Star Media.\n\n=== Literature ===\n[[Richard Condon]]'s 1959 novel ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'' describes brainwashed Raymond Shaw, the \"perfectly prefabricated assassin,\" as \"this dream by Lavrenti Beria.\"\n\nIn the 1964 science fiction novel by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, ''[[Hard to Be a God]]'', Beria is personified in the character Don Reba who serves as the king's minister of defence.\n\nAt the opening of [[Kingsley Amis]]' ''[[The Alteration]]'', Lavrentiy Beria figures as \"Monsignor Laurentius\", paired with the similarly black-clad cleric \"Monsignor Henricus\" of the Holy Office (i.e., the [[Inquisition]]); the one to whom Beria was compared by Stalin in our own timeline: [[Heinrich Himmler]]. In the novel, both men are on the same side, serving an alternate-world Catholic Empire.\n\nBeria is a significant character in the [[alternate history]]/[[alien invasion]] novel series ''[[Worldwar]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]] as well as the ''[[Axis of Time]]'' series by [[John Birmingham]]\n\nIn the 1981 novel ''[[Noble House]]'' by [[James Clavell]] set in 1963 Hong Kong, the main character Ian Dunross received from Alan Medford Grant a set of secret documents regarding a Soviet spy-ring in Hong Kong code-named \"Sevrin\". The document was signed by an LB, believed by Grant (and the mysterious Tip Tok-Toh) to be Lavrentiy Beria (written as Lavrenti Beria in the novel).\n\nBeria is a significant character in the opening chapters of the 1998 novel [[Archangel (Robert Harris novel)|''Archangel'']] by British novelist [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]].\n\nBeria is a minor character in the 2009 novel ''[[The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared]]'' by [[Jonas Jonasson]].

In 1920 or 1921 (accounts vary) Beria joined the [[Cheka]], the original Bolshevik [[secret police]]. At that time, a Bolshevik revolt took place in the [[Menshevik]]-controlled [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]], and the Red Army subsequently [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|invaded]]. The Cheka became heavily involved in the conflict, which resulted in the defeat of the Mensheviks and the formation of the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgian SSR]]. By 1922, Beria was deputy head of the Georgian branch of Cheka's successor, the [[State Political Directorate|OGPU]].\n\nIn 1924, he led the repression of a [[August Uprising|Georgian nationalist uprising]], after which up to 10,000 people were executed. For this display of \"Bolshevik ruthlessness,\" Beria was appointed head of the \"secret-political division\" of the [[South Caucasus|Transcaucasian]] OGPU and was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner]].\n\nIn 1926, Beria became head of the Georgian OGPU; [[Sergo Ordzhonikidze]], head of the Transcaucasian party, introduced him to fellow-Georgian Iosef Dzhughashvili, later known as [[Joseph Stalin]]. As a result, Beria became an ally in Stalin's rise to power. During his years at the helm of the Georgian OGPU, Beria effectively destroyed the intelligence networks that [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]] had developed in the Soviet Caucasus, while successfully penetrating the governments of these countries with his agents. He also took over Stalin's holiday security.\n\n[[File:Makharadze, Mir-Jafar Bagirov, Beria.jpg|thumb|left|Beria on Caucasian [[CPSU|Party]] caucus, 1935. Left to right: [[Filipp Makharadze]], [[Mir Jafar Baghirov]], Beria.]]\n\nBeria was appointed Secretary of the Communist Party in Georgia in 1931, and for the whole Transcaucasian region in 1932. He became a member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1934. During this time, he began to attack fellow members of the Georgian Communist Party, particularly [[Gaioz Devdariani]], who served as Minister of Education of the Georgian SSR. Beria ordered the executions of Devdariani's brothers George and Shalva, who held important positions in the Cheka and the Communist Party respectively.\n\nHe reportedly won Stalin's favour in the early 1930s, after faking a conspiracy to assassinate the Soviet leader that he then claimed to have foiled. By 1935, Beria had become one of Stalin's most trusted subordinates. He cemented his place in Stalin's entourage with a lengthy oration titled, \"On the History of the Bolshevik Organisations in Transcaucasia\" (later published as a book), which emphasised Stalin's role.{{sfn|Knight|1996|p=57}} When Stalin's purge of the Communist Party and government began in 1934 after the assassination of [[Leningrad]] party boss [[Sergei Kirov]] (1 December 1934), Beria ran the purges in Transcaucasia. He used the opportunity to settle many old scores in the politically turbulent Transcaucasian republics.\n\nIn June 1937, he said in a speech, \"Let our enemies know that anyone who attempts to raise a hand against the will of our people, against the will of the party of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and Stalin, will be mercilessly crushed and destroyed.\"<ref>{{harvnb|\u0417\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|2000}} cited by [http://www.hrono.ru/biograf/beria.html \u0411\u0435\u0440\u0438\u044f \u041b\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0439 \u041f\u0430\u0432\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447], biographical index, editor Vyacheslav Rumyantsev</ref>\n\n== Head of the NKVD ==\n\n[[File:Katyn - decision of massacre p1.jpg|thumb|The first page of Beria's notice (oversigned by Stalin), to kill approximately 15,000 Polish officers and some 10,000 more intellectuals in the [[Katyn massacre|Katyn Forest]] and other places in the Soviet Union]]\n[[File:Khrushchyov, Beria and Khanjian.jpg|thumb|[[Nestor Lakoba]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]], Lavrenti Beria and [[Aghasi Khanjian]] during the opening of the [[Moscow Metro]] in 1936.

Under [[Nikolai Yezhov]], the NKVD carried out the [[Great Purge]]: the imprisonment or execution of millions of people throughout the Soviet Union as alleged \"[[enemy of the people|enemies of the people]].\" By 1938, however, the oppression had become so extensive that it was damaging the infrastructure, economy and even the armed forces of the Soviet state, prompting Stalin to wind the purge down. Stalin had voted to appoint [[Georgy Malenkov]] as head of the NKVD, but he was over-ruled.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} In September, Beria was appointed head of the Main Administration of State Security (GUGB) of the NKVD, and in November he succeeded Yezhov as NKVD head.

Over 100,000 people were released from the labour camps. The government officially admitted that there had been some injustice and \"excesses\" during the purges, which were blamed entirely on Yezhov. The liberalisation was only relative: arrests and executions continued, and in 1940, as war approached, the pace of the purges again accelerated. During this period, Beria supervised deportations of people identified as political enemies from Poland and the [[Baltic states]] after Soviet occupation of those regions.\n\nIn March 1939, Beria became a candidate member of the Communist Party's [[Politburo]]. Although he did not become a full member until 1946, he was already one of the senior leaders of the Soviet state. In 1941, Beria was made a Commissar General of State Security, the highest quasi-military rank within the Soviet police system of that time, effectively comparable to a [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]].\n\nOn 5 March 1940, after the [[Gestapo\u2013NKVD Conferences|Gestapo\u2013NKVD Third Conference]] was held in [[Zakopane]], Beria sent a note (no. 794/B) to Stalin in which he stated that the Polish prisoners of war kept at camps and prisons in western Belarus and Ukraine were enemies of the Soviet Union, and recommended their execution.<ref>Rotfeld, Adam Daniel; Torkunov, Anatoly. \"White Spots\u2014Black Spots: Difficult Matters in Polish-Russian Relations, 1918\u20132008\".

With Stalin's approval, Beria's NKVD executed them in what became known as the [[Katyn massacre]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nFrom October 1940 to February 1942, the NKVD under Beria carried out a [[Purge of the Red Army in 1941|new purge]] of the Red Army and related industries. In February 1941, Beria became [[Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|Deputy chairman]] of the [[Council of People's Commissars]], and in June, following [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union]], he became a member of the [[State Defense Committee]] (GKO). During [[World War II]], he took on major domestic responsibilities and mobilised the millions of people imprisoned in NKVD Gulag camps into wartime production. He took control of the manufacture of armaments, and (with [[Georgy Malenkov]]) aircraft and aircraft engines. This was the beginning of Beria's alliance with Malenkov, which later became of central importance.\n\nIn 1944, as the Germans were driven from Soviet soil, Beria was in charge of dealing with the various ethnic minorities accused of anti-sovietism and/or collaboration with the invaders, including the [[Balkars]], [[Karachays]], [[Chechen people|Chechens]], [[Ingush people|Ingush]], [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Kalmyks]], [[Greeks in Kazakhstan|Pontic Greeks]], and [[Volga Germans]].<ref>{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=SnLANpCfDn4C&printsec=frontcover | page = 122|title =Ethnic Cleansing in the USSR, 1937\u20131949|isbn = 9780313309212|last1=Pohl|first1 = Jonathan Otto|year = 1999|publisher=Greenwood press|location=Westport, Connecticut|oclc=40158950}}</ref> All these groups were deported to [[Soviet Central Asia]] (see \"[[Population transfer in the Soviet Union]]\").\n\nIn December 1944, Beria's NKVD was assigned to supervise the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]] (\"Task No. 1\"), which built and tested a bomb by 29 August 1949. The project was extremely labour-intensive. At least 330,000 people, including 10,000 technicians, were involved. The [[Gulag]] system provided tens of thousands of people for work in [[uranium]] mines and for the construction and operation of uranium processing plants. They also constructed test facilities, such as those at [[Semipalatinsk Test Site|Semipalatinsk]] and in the [[Novaya Zemlya]] archipelago. The NKVD also ensured the necessary security for the project.\n\nIn July 1945, as Soviet police ranks were converted to a military uniform system, Beria's rank was officially converted to that of [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]]. Although he had never held a traditional military command, Beria made a significant contribution to the victory of the Soviet Union in World War II through his organisation of wartime production and his use of partisans. Stalin personally never thought much of it, and neither commented publicly on his performance nor awarded him recognition (i.e. [[Order of Victory]]), as he did for most other Soviet Marshals.\n\nAbroad, Beria had met with [[Kim Il-sung]], the future leader of [[North Korea]], several times when the Soviet troops had declared war on Japan and occupied the northern half of Korea from August 1945. Beria recommended that Stalin install a communist leader in the occupied territories.<ref>[http://ysfine.com/wisdom/wk01.html Beria/Kim Il-sung] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528043524/http://ysfine.com/wisdom/wk01.html |date=28 May 2013 }}</ref><ref name=\"scmp.com\">{{cite web|author=Mark O&#039;Neill |url=http://www.scmp.com/article/727755/kim-il-sungs-secret-history |title=Kim Il-sung's secret history |work=South China Morning Post |accessdate=15 April 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227095258/http://www.scmp.com/article/727755/kim-il-sungs-secret-history |archivedate=27 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\n== Post-war politics ==\n\n[[File:Lavrenti Beria Stalins family.jpg|thumb|300px|Beria with Stalin (in background), Stalin's daughter [[Svetlana Alliluyeva|Svetlana]], and [[Nestor Lakoba]] (obscured)<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/geschichte/article124705617/Als-Sotschi-das-Zentrum-des-Terrors-war.html|title= Ferien mit Stalin: Als Sotschi das Zentrum des Terrors war|author= Berthold Seewald|newspaper=[[Die Welt]]|language=German|access-date=6 September 2015|date= 10 February 2014}}</ref>]]\n\nWith Stalin nearing 70, a concealed struggle for succession amongst his entourage dominated Kremlin politics in the post-war years. At the end of the war, [[Andrei Zhdanov]] seemed the most likely candidate. Zhdanov had served as the Communist Party leader in Leningrad during the war, and by 1946 had charge of all cultural matters. After 1946, Beria formed an alliance with Malenkov to counter Zhdanov's rise.{{sfn|Knight|1996|p=143}}\n\nIn January 1946, Beria resigned as chief of the NKVD while retaining general control over national security matters as Deputy Prime Minister and Curator of the Organs of State Security under Stalin. However, the new NKVD chief, [[Sergei Kruglov (politician)|Sergei Kruglov]], was not a Beria man. Also, by the summer of 1946, Beria's man [[Vsevolod Nikolayevich Merkulov]] was replaced as head of the [[Ministry for State Security (Soviet Union)|Ministry for State Security (MGB)]] by [[Viktor Semyonovich Abakumov|Viktor Abakumov]]. Abakumov had headed [[SMERSH]] from 1943 to 1946; his relationship with Beria involved close collaboration (since Abakumov owed his rise to Beria's support and esteem), but also rivalry. Stalin had begun to encourage Abakumov to form his own network inside the MGB to counter Beria's dominance of the power ministries.{{sfn|Parrish|1996}} Kruglov and Abakumov moved expeditiously to replace Beria's men in the security apparatus leadership with new people. Very soon, Deputy Minister Stepan Mamulov of the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs was the only close Beria ally left outside foreign intelligence, on which Beria kept a grip. In the following months, Abakumov started carrying out important operations without consulting Beria, often working in tandem with Zhdanov, and on Stalin's direct orders. These operations were aimed by Stalin\u2014initially tangentially, but with time more directly\u2013at Beria.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nOne of the first such moves involved the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]] affair, which commenced in October 1946 and eventually led to the murder of [[Solomon Mikhoels]] and the arrest of many other members. This affair damaged Beria; not only had he championed the creation of the committee in 1942, but his own entourage included a substantial number of Jews.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nAfter Zhdanov died suddenly in August 1948, Beria and Malenkov consolidated their power by means of a purge of Zhdanov's associates in the so-called \"[[Leningrad Affair]]\". Those executed included Zhdanov's deputy, [[Alexey Kuznetsov]]; the economic chief, [[Nikolai Voznesensky]]; the Party head in Leningrad, Pyotr Popkov; and the Prime Minister of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Republic]], [[Mikhail Rodionov]].{{sfn|Knight|1996|p=151}}\n\nDuring the postwar years, Beria supervised installation of Communist regimes in the countries of Eastern Europe and hand-picked the Soviet-backed leaders.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 10 Odd Facts about Stalin|url=http://mixtopten.com/top-10-odd-facts-about-stalin-and-his-death/|website=Mix Top Ten|accessdate=6 August 2014|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810052437/http://mixtopten.com/top-10-odd-facts-about-stalin-and-his-death/|archivedate=10 August 2014}}</ref> Starting in 1948, Abakumov initiated several investigations against these leaders, which culminated with the arrest in November 1951 of [[Rudolf Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd]], [[Bed\u0159ich Geminder]], and others in [[Czechoslovakia]]. These men were frequently accused of [[Zionism]], \"[[rootless cosmopolitan]]ism\", and providing weapons to Israel. Such charges deeply disturbed Beria, as he had directly ordered the sale of large amounts of Czech arms to Israel. Altogether, 14 Czechoslovak Communist leaders, 11 of them Jewish, were tried, convicted, and executed (see [[Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd trial]]). Similar investigations in Poland and other Soviet satellite countries occurred at the same time.\n\nIn 1951, Abakumov was replaced by [[Semyon Ignatyev]], who further intensified the anti-Semitic campaign. On 13 January 1953, the biggest anti-semitic affair in the Soviet Union started with an article in ''[[Pravda]]'' \u2013 it began what became known as the [[Doctors' plot]], in which a number of the country's prominent Jewish physicians were accused of poisoning top Soviet leaders and arrested. Concurrently, the Soviet press began an anti-semitic propaganda campaign, euphemistically termed the \"struggle against rootless cosmopolitanism\". Initially, 37 men were arrested, but the number quickly grew into hundreds. Scores of Soviet Jews were dismissed from their jobs, arrested, sent to the Gulag, or executed. The \"Doctors' plot\" was presumably invented by Stalin as an excuse to dismiss Beria and replace him with Ignatiev or some other MGB functionary. A few days after Stalin's death on 5 March 1953, Beria freed all the arrested doctors, announced that the entire matter was fabricated, and arrested the MGB functionaries directly involved.\n\nIn other international issues, Beria (along with [[Anastas Mikoyan|Mikoyan]]) correctly foresaw the victory (1949\u20131950) of [[Mao Zedong]] in the [[Chinese Civil War]] and greatly helped the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]] by letting them use Soviet-occupied [[Manchuria]] as a staging area and arranging large weapons shipments to the [[People's Liberation Army]], mainly from the recently captured equipment of the Japanese [[Kwantung Army]].{{sfn|Chang|Halliday|2005|}}{{page needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Sexual predator==\nAt Beria's trial in 1953, it became known that he had committed numerous rapes during the years he was NKVD chief.<ref>{{cite book|first=Donald|last=Rayfield|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yi3ow3TU8-4C&pg=RA10-PT11|title=Stalin and His Hangmen: The Tyrant and Those Who Killed for Him|publisher=[[Random House]]|location=New York City|date=2005|isbn=978-0-375-75771-6|pages=466\u2013467}}</ref> [[Simon Sebag-Montefiore]], a biographer of Stalin, concluded the information \"reveals a sexual predator who used his power to indulge himself in obsessive depravity.\"{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=506}} After his death, charges of sexual abuse and rape were disputed by people close to him including his wife Nina and his son Sergo.{{sfn||Sudoplatov|1995|p=97}}\n\nHis case files in the Soviet archives contained the official testimony from Colonel Rafael Semyonovich Sarkisov and Colonel Sardion Nikolaevich Nadaraia, two of Beria's most senior NKVD bodyguards. They stated that, on warm nights during the war years, Beria was often driven slowly through the streets of Moscow in his armoured [[Packard]] limousine. He would point out young women to be detained and escorted to his mansion, where wine and a feast awaited them. After dining, Beria would take the women into his soundproofed office and rape them. Beria's bodyguards reported that their duties included handing each victim a flower bouquet as she left Beria's house. Accepting it implied that the sex had been consensual; refusal would mean arrest. In one incident, his chief bodyguard, Sarkisov, reported that a woman who had been brought to Beria rejected his advances and ran out of his office; Sarkisov mistakenly handed her the flowers anyway, prompting the enraged Beria to declare, \"Now it's not a bouquet, it's a wreath! May it rot on your grave!\" The NKVD arrested the woman the next day.{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=506}}\n\nWomen also submitted to Beria's sexual advances in exchange for the promise of freeing their relatives from the Gulag. In one case, Beria picked up [[Tatiana Okunevskaya]], a well-known Soviet actress, under the pretence of bringing her to perform for the [[Politburo]]. Instead he took her to his dacha, where he offered to free her father and grandmother from NKVD prison if she submitted. He then raped her, telling her: \"Scream or not, it doesn't matter.\"{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=507}} Beria, however, already knew that her relatives had been executed months earlier. Okunevskaya was arrested shortly afterwards and sentenced to [[solitary confinement]] in the Gulag, which she survived.\n\nBeria's sexually predatory nature was well known to the Politburo, and though Stalin took an indulgent viewpoint (considering Beria's wartime importance), he said, \"I don't trust Beria.\" In one instance, when Stalin learned his daughter [[Svetlana Stalin|Svetlana]] was alone with Beria at his house, he telephoned her and told her to leave immediately. When Beria complimented [[Alexander Poskrebyshev]]'s daughter on her beauty, Poskrebyshev quickly pulled her aside and instructed her, \"Don't ever accept a lift from Beria.\"{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=508}} After taking an interest in Marshal [[Kliment Voroshilov]]'s daughter-in-law during a party at their summer dacha, Beria shadowed their car closely all the way back to the Kremlin, terrifying Voroshilov's wife.\n\nPrior to and during the war, Beria directed Sarkisov to keep a running list of the names and phone numbers of his sexual encounters. Eventually, he ordered Sarkisov to destroy the list as a security risk, but the colonel retained a secret handwritten copy. When Beria's fall from power began, Sarkisov passed the list to [[Viktor Abakumov]], the former wartime head of [[SMERSH]] and now chief of the [[Ministry for State Security (Soviet Union)|MGB]] \u2013 the successor to the NKVD. Abakumov was already aggressively building a case against Beria. Stalin, who was also seeking to undermine Beria, was thrilled by the detailed records kept by Sarkisov, demanding: \"Send me everything this asshole writes down!\"{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=507}} Sarkisov reported that Beria's sexual appetite had led to him contracting [[syphilis]] during the war, for which he was secretly treated without the knowledge of Stalin or the Politburo (a fact Beria later admitted during his interrogation).{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=537}} Although the Russian government acknowledged Sarkisov's handwritten list of Beria's victims on 17 January 2003, the victims' names will not be released until 2028.\n\nEvidence suggests that not only did Beria abduct and rape women, but that some were also murdered. His villa in Moscow is now the Tunisian Embassy (at {{nowrap|{{coord|55|45|34|N|37|35|10|E|scale:10000_type:landmark_region:RU|display=inline|name=The former residence of Lavrentiy Beria in Moscow}}}}).

According to historian [[Amy Knight]], \"Smith noted that Beria's escapades were common knowledge among embassy personnel because his house was on the same street as a residence for Americans, and those who lived there saw girls brought to Beria's house late at night in a limousine.\"{{sfn|Knight|1996|p=97}}\n\n== Stalin's death ==\nKhrushchev wrote in his memoirs that Beria had, immediately after Stalin's stroke, gone about \"spewing hatred against [Stalin] and mocking him.\" When Stalin showed signs of consciousness, Beria dropped to his knees and kissed his hand. When Stalin fell unconscious again, Beria immediately stood and spat.{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=571}} Stalin's aide Vasili Lozgachev reported that Beria and Malenkov were the first members of the Politburo to see Stalin's condition when he was found unconscious. They arrived at Stalin's dacha at Kuntsevo at 03:00 on 2 March, after being called by Khrushchev and Bulganin. The latter two did not want to risk Stalin's wrath by checking themselves.{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=639}} Lozgachev tried to explain to Beria that the unconscious Stalin (still in his soiled clothing) was \"sick and needed medical attention.\" Beria angrily dismissed his claims as panic-mongering and quickly left, ordering him, \"Don't bother us, don't cause a panic and don't disturb Comrade Stalin!\"{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=605}} Calling a doctor was deferred for a full 12 hours after Stalin was rendered paralysed, incontinent and unable to speak. This decision is noted as \"extraordinary\" by the historian Simon Sebag-Montefiore but also consistent with the standard Stalinist policy of deferring all decision-making (no matter how necessary or obvious) without official orders from higher authority.{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=640-44}}\n\nBeria's decision to avoid immediately calling a doctor was tacitly supported (or at least not opposed) by the rest of the Politburo, which was rudderless without Stalin's micromanagement and paralysed by a legitimate fear he would suddenly recover and take reprisals on anyone who had dared to act without his orders.{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=638-41}} Stalin's suspicion of doctors in the wake of the [[Doctors' Plot]] was well known at the time of his sickness; his private physician was already being tortured in the basement of the [[Lubyanka Building|Lubyanka]] for suggesting the leader required more bed rest.{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=640}}\n\nAfter Stalin's death, Beria claimed to have killed him. This aborted a final purge of [[Old Bolsheviks]] [[Anastas Mikoyan|Mikoyan]] and [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]], for which Stalin had been laying the groundwork in the year prior to his death. Shortly after Stalin's death, Beria announced triumphantly to the Politburo that he had \"done [Stalin] in\" and \"saved [us] all\", according to Molotov's memoirs. The assertion that Stalin was poisoned by Beria's associates has been supported by [[Edvard Radzinsky]] and other authors.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.surgicalneurologyint.com/article.asp?issn=2152-7806;year=2011;volume=2;issue=1;spage=161;epage=161;aulast=Faria |last=Faria|first=Miguel|year=2011 |title=Stalin's mysterious death |journal=Surgical Neurology International |issn=2152-7806 |volume=2 |issue=1 |page=161 |doi=10.4103/2152-7806.89876 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425121806/http://www.surgicalneurologyint.com/article.asp?issn=2152-7806%3Byear%3D2011%3Bvolume%3D2%3Bissue%3D1%3Bspage%3D161%3Bepage%3D161%3Baulast%3DFaria |archivedate=25 April 2012 |pmc=3228382 |pmid=22140646}}</ref>{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=640}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Naumov|first1=Vladimir|last2=Brent|first2=Jonathan |title=Stalin's Last Crime: The Plot Against the Jewish Doctors, 1948\u20131953 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |year=2003 |isbn=0-06-019524-X}}</ref><ref>Faria, Miguel A.

In the uneasy silence following the cessation of Stalin's last agonies, Beria was the first to dart forward to kiss his lifeless form (a move likened by Sebag-Montefiore to \"wrenching a dead King's ring off his finger\".){{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=649}} While the rest of Stalin's inner circle (even Molotov, saved from certain liquidation) stood sobbing unashamedly over the body, Beria reportedly appeared \"radiant\", \"regenerated\" and \"glistening with ill-concealed relish.\"{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=649}} When Beria left the room, he broke the somber atmosphere by shouting loudly for his driver, his voice echoing with what Stalin's daughter [[Svetlana Alliluyeva]] called \"the ring of triumph unconcealed.\"{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=650}} Alliluyeva noticed how the Politburo seemed openly frightened of Beria and unnerved by his bold display of ambition. \"He's off to take power,\" Mikoyan recalled muttering to Khrushchev. That prompted a \"frantic\" dash for their own limousines to intercept him at the Kremlin.{{sfn|Montefiore|2003|p=650}}\n\n== First Deputy Premier and Soviet triumvir ==\nAfter Stalin's death, Beria was appointed [[First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|First Deputy Premier]] and reappointed head of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Soviet Union)|MVD]], which he merged with the MGB. His close ally Malenkov was the new [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Prime Minister]] and initially the most powerful man in the post-Stalin leadership. Beria was second most powerful, and given Malenkov's personal weakness, was poised to become the power behind the throne and ultimately leader himself. Khrushchev became Party Secretary. [[Kliment Voroshilov|Voroshilov]] became Chairman of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] (i.e., the head of state).\n\nBeria undertook some measures of liberalisation immediately after Stalin's death.{{sfn|Knight|1996|p=184}} He reorganised the MVD and drastically reduced its economic power and penal responsibilities. A number of costly construction projects such as the [[Salekhard\u2013Igarka Railway]] were scrapped, and the remaining industrial enterprises became affiliated under corresponding economic ministries.{{sfn|Kozlov|Gilburd|2013|p=111}} The Gulag system was transferred to the [[Ministry of Justice (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Justice]], and a mass release of over a million prisoners, almost half of the Gulag personnel, was announced, although political prisoners were excluded.{{sfn|Kozlov|Gilburd|2013|p=112}} The amnesty, however, led to a substantial increase in crime and would later be used against Beria by his rivals.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hardy |first1=Jeffrey S. |title=The Gulag After Stalin: Redefining Punishment in Khrushchev's Soviet Union, 1953\u20131964 |date=2016 |publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] |location=Ithaca, New York |isbn=9781501706042 |pages=23\u201324}}</ref>{{sfn|Kozlov|Gilburd|2013|p=114}}\n\nTo consolidate power, Beria also took steps to recognise the rights of non-Russian nationalities. He questioned the traditional policy of Russification and encouraged local officials to assert their own identities. He first turned to Georgia, where Stalin's fabricated [[Mingrelian affair]] was called off and the republic's key posts were replaced by pro-Beria Georgians.{{sfn|Knight|1996|p=187}} Beria's policies in Ukraine alarmed Khrushchev, for whom Ukraine was a power base. Khrushchev then tried to draw Malenkov to his side, warning that \"Beria is sharpening his knives\".{{sfn|Knight|1996|p=190}}\n\nKhrushchev opposed the alliance between Beria and Malenkov but he was initially unable to challenge them. Khrushchev's opportunity came in June 1953 when a spontaneous [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprising]] against the East German Communist regime broke out in [[East Berlin]]. Based on Beria's statements, other leaders suspected that in the wake of the uprising, he might be willing to trade the reunification of Germany and the end of the [[Cold War]] for massive aid from the United States, as had been received in World War II. The cost of the war still weighed heavily on the Soviet economy. Beria craved the vast financial resources that another (more sustained) relationship with the United States could provide. Beria gave [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] serious prospects of national autonomy, possibly similarly to other Soviet [[satellite state]]s in Europe.<ref>{{cite book |title=Communism and the Emergence of Democracy |first=Harald |last=Wydra |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge, England|year=2007 |isbn=978-0-521-85169-5 |page=165}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Cold War: a new history |first=John Lewis |last=Gaddis |authorlink=John Lewis Gaddis |publisher=[[Penguin Press]] |location=New York City |year=2005 |isbn=1-59420-062-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/coldwarnewhistor00gadd }}</ref>{{sfn|Knight|1996|p=189}} Beria said of East Germany \"It's not even a real state but one kept in being only by Soviet troops.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.history.co.uk/article/historys-forgotten-people-lavrentiy-beria|title=History's forgotten people: Lavrentiy Beria|website=[[History Channel|History.com]]|accessdate=19 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|East German uprising]] convinced [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]], Malenkov, and [[Nikolai Bulganin]] that Beria's policies were dangerous and destabilising to Soviet power. Within days of the events in Germany, Khrushchev persuaded the other leaders to support a Party ''[[coup d'etat|coup]]'' against Beria; Beria's principal ally Malenkov abandoned him.\n\n== Arrest, trial and execution ==\n[[File:Lavrenty Beria-TIME-1953.jpg|right|thumb|Lavrenty Beria on [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] cover in 1953]]\nBeria was chairman of the Council of Ministers and a influential Politburo member and saw himself as Stalin's successor, while wider Politburo members had contrasting thoughts on future leadership. On 26 June 1953, Beria was arrested and held in an undisclosed location near Moscow. Accounts of Beria's fall vary considerably. By the most likely account, Khrushchev prepared an elaborate ambush, convening a meeting of the Presidium on 26 June, where he suddenly launched a scathing attack on Beria, accusing him of being a traitor and spy in the pay of British intelligence. Beria was taken completely by surprise. He asked, \"What's going on, Nikita Sergeyevich? Why are you picking fleas in my trousers?\" Molotov and others quickly spoke against Beria one after the other, followed by a motion by Khrushchev for his instant dismissal.\n\nWhen Beria finally realised what was happening and plaintively appealed to Malenkov to speak for him, his old friend and crony silently hung his head and refused to meet his gaze. Malenkov pressed a button on his desk as the pre-arranged signal to Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]] and a group of armed officers in a nearby room who burst in and arrested Beria.{{refn|group=note|This fits an account from Khrushchev's perspective.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Andrew|first1 = Christopher|author1-link = Christopher Andrew (historian)|first2 = Oleg|last2 = Gordievsky|title = KGB: The Inside Story|edition = 1st|year = 1990|publisher = HarperCollins Publishers|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 0-06-016605-3|pages = [https://archive.org/details/kgbinsidestoryof00chri/page/423 423\u201324]|chapter = 11|chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/kgbinsidestoryof00chri/page/423}}</ref>}}\n\nBeria was taken first to the Moscow [[Military prison|guardhouse]] and then to the [[bunker]] of the headquarters of [[Moscow Military District]]. Defence Minister Nikolai Bulganin ordered the [[4th Guards Kantemirovskaya Tank Division|Kantemirovskaya Tank Division]] and [[2nd Guards Tamanskaya Motor Rifle Division|Tamanskaya Motor Rifle Division]] to move into Moscow to prevent security forces loyal to Beria from rescuing him. Many of Beria's subordinates, proteges and associates were also arrested, among them [[Vsevolod Merkulov]], [[Bogdan Kobulov]], [[Sergo Goglidze|Sergey Goglidze]], [[Vladimir Dekanozov]], Pavel Meshik, and Lev Vlodzimirskiy. ''[[Pravda]]'' did not announce Beria's arrest until 10 July, crediting it to Malenkov and referring to Beria's \"criminal activities against the Party and the State.\"\n\nBeria and the others were tried by a \"special court presence\" ({{lang|ru|\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435}}) of the [[Supreme Court of the Soviet Union]] on 23 December 1953 with no defence counsel and no right of appeal. Marshal [[Ivan Konev]] was the chairman of the court.\n\nBeria was found guilty of:\n# [[Treason]]. It was alleged that he had maintained secret connections with foreign intelligence services. In particular, attempts to initiate peace talks with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] in 1941 through the ambassador of the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] were classified as treason, though Beria had been acting on the orders of Stalin and Molotov. It was also alleged that Beria, who in 1942 helped organise [[Battle of the Caucasus|the defence of the North Caucasus]], tried to let the Germans occupy the Caucasus. Beria's suggestion to his assistants that to improve foreign relations it was reasonable to transfer the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] to Germany, [[Karelian question in Finnish politics|part of Karelia]] to Finland, the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]] to [[Communist Romania|Romania]] and the [[Kuril Islands]] to Japan also formed part of the allegations against him.\n# [[Terrorism]]. Beria's participation in the [[Purge of the Red Army in 1941]] was classified as an act of terrorism.\n# Counter-revolutionary activity during the [[Russian Civil War]]. In 1919 Beria worked in the security service of the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]]. Beria maintained that he was assigned to that work by the [[Muslim Social Democratic Party|Hummet]] party, which subsequently merged with the Adalat Party, the [[Ahrar Party (Azerbaijan)|Ahrar Party]], and the [[Baku]] Bolsheviks to establish the [[Azerbaijan Communist Party]].\n\nBeria and all the other defendants were sentenced to death on 23 December 1953.

The area was once an important defence stronghold against pirates and foreign military during the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties.\n\nDeveloped as part of the [[Airport Core Programme]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/napco/index-e.html |title=NAPCO|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050405043554/http://www.info.gov.hk/napco/index-e.html|archivedate=5 April 2005}}</ref> the [[North Lantau New Town]] is the first [[New towns of Hong Kong|new town]] on an [[Islands of Hong Kong|outlying island]] of [[Hong Kong]], with the first phases built on [[Land reclamation in Hong Kong|reclaimed land]] to the north, east and northeast of the original Tung Chung Town. Administratively, Tung Chung is part of [[Islands District]].\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==History==\n===Early times===\nSince the [[Song Dynasty]] between 960\u20131279 AD, there have been people living in Tung Chung. At that time, they lived on fishing and agriculture. Crabs, fishes and crops were their main productions.\n\nThis place was originally called ''Tung Sai Chung'', when Hong Kong was still a group of fishing villages. ''Tung'' means ''east'' in [[Cantonese]], while ''Sai'' means ''west''. At that time, merchandising ships sailed east to the village and west to [[Macau]].\n\nTung Chung may be a new town, but its heritage can be seen in the form of old fishing villages. They show another fa\u00e7ade of Tung Chung, of a village before the development of the airport and the town.\n\n=== New town development ===\nIn the 1990s, Tung Chung was developed as a [[New towns of Hong Kong|new town]]. This was undertaken as part of the [[Airport Core Programme]], a package of development and infrastructure projects surrounding the relocation of [[Hong Kong International Airport|Hong Kong's international airport]] from [[Kai Tak Airport|Kai Tak]] to [[Chek Lap Kok]], adjacent to Tung Chung. Tung Chung New Town was intended to serve as a supporting community for the new airport.<ref name=\"napcotungchungph1\">{{cite web|title=Tung Chung New Town (Phase 1)|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/archive/napco/p-tung.html|website=Hong Kong Airport Core Programme|publisher=New Airport Projects Co-ordination Office|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the information from the Hong Kong [[Territory Development Department]], Tung Chung is being developed in four phases into a new town with a target population of 250,000 people. The first phase was completed in 1994; infrastructure works was completed in January 1997 in order to tie with the subsequent completion of the first housing developments. This phase of development provided about 20,000 people in the district to support the airport at [[Chek Lap Kok]].\n\nPhase 2 of Tung Chung development was also completed. About 350,000 square metres of [[Land reclamation in Hong Kong|land was reclaimed]] east of the Phase 1 development area. Roads and drainage works to serve this reclaimed land were completed in May 2000. Land formation of 270,000 m<sup>2</sup> for the remaining Phase 2 areas south of [[Tung Chung Bay]] together with the associated infrastructure were completed in February 2001. Upon completion, Phase 2 development will accommodate a population of 67,000.\n\nReclamation works under Phase 3A development commenced in March 1999 and were completed in April 2003. About 260,000 m<sup>2</sup> of land was reclaimed north-east of Phase I development area. The reclamation will provide land for housing developments to accommodate a population of about 22,000.\n\nThe remaining development in Tung Chung is planned to be implemented as Phases 3 and 4 and to be completed in a foreseeable future.\n\nCurrently, Tung Chung is primarily residential, but an office block and hotel have already been completed. It is envisaged that in the future, other commercial projects will be developed in Tung Chung to support the growing population.\n\n==Housing==\n[[Image:Caribbean Square Bermuda Park 2016.jpg|thumb|right|Private housing estates in Tung Chung New Town]]\n[[File:Yat Tung Estate 1.jpg|thumb|Yat Tung Estate viewed across [[Tung Chung Bay]], with [[Sunset Peak (Hong Kong)|Sunset Peak]] in the background]]\nTung Chung New Town (Phase 1) is the newly developed core living area around Tung Chung. The development is one of the ten parts of the Hong Kong Airport Core Programme.<ref name=\"napcotungchungph1\"/> The first phase of [[public housing in Hong Kong|public housing development]] was completed in late 1997 and can accommodate up to 15,000 people. Another 5,000 people are housed in the private housing development completed in 1998.\n\n===Private housing estates===\n'''Tung Chung Crescent''' is the MTR Tung Chung Station Development Package One together with Seaview Crescent and Citygate. It is the first private residential estate completed in Tung Chung. It is jointly developed by five local developers including Hang Lung Development Co. Ltd., [[Henderson Land Development Co. Ltd.]], [[New World Development Co. Ltd.]], [[Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd.]], [[Swire Properties]] and with the [[MTR Corporation]].\n\n'''Seaview Crescent''', developed by the same developers as Tung Chung Crescent, consists of four tower blocks in the same style of Tung Chung Crescent, though these face the sea and the airport at Chek Lap Kok.\n\n'''Coastal Skyline''' is the MTR Tung Chung Station Development Package Two. It was jointly developed by [[HKR International Limited]], Hong Leong Holdings Limited and Reco Tung Chung Pte Ltd. and MTR Corporation and consisting of seven residential towers of around 50 stories each, and a number of low-rise flats.\n\n'''Caribbean Coast''' is the MTR Tung Chung Station Development Package Three. It was jointly developed by [[Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited]], [[Hutchison Whampoa Limited]] and the MTR Corporation. It is about 67,900 m<sup>2</sup> with both residential and commercial buildings.\n\n===Public housing estates===\n{{see also|Public housing estates on Lantau Island}}\nPublic (government) housing and [[Home Ownership Scheme]] flats also make up a sizeable part of Tung Chung. The first phase of public housing development including five homeownership blocks at Yu Tung Court and three public rental housing blocks at Fu Tung Estate comprising 2,640 homeownership and 1,664 rental units. [[Yat Tung Estate]] is a newer integrated development consisting of twenty 40-story tower blocks towards the south of the town center, near the fishing village in [[Tung Chung Bay]], complete with kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, shopping mall, car park, and transport interchange. [[Public housing estates on Lantau Island # Ying Tung Estate|Ying Tung Estate]] was built in 2018 near Ying Tung Road, which consists of four blocks: Ying Chui House, Ying Yuet House, Ying Hei House and Ying Fuk House.\n\n==Shopping and dining==\n[[File: Citygate Bridge Corridor 201308.jpg|thumb|Citygate shopping center]]\nTung Chung Town Centre features a number of shops, restaurants, a cinema and entertainment facilities centered on the [[Citygate]] development; as well as transportation to [[Kowloon]] or [[Hong Kong Island]]. The Tung Chung Citygate Outlets have many factory outlets of high-end brands and other brands as well as offering huge discounts.\nFu Tung Shopping Centre, Yat Tung Shopping Centre, and [[Citygate]]<ref>http://www.citygateoutlets.com.hk</ref> are the three shopping centres in Tung Chung thus far. Further shopping malls are expected at the new developments in '''Caribbean Coast'''. Tung Chung is 12 minutes from [[Tsing Yi]] and [[Kwai Tsing]], where a much wider variety of shopping options are available.\n\nCitygate Outlets is at the heart of this new town, developed in conjunction with the [[Tung Chung Station (MTR)|Tung Chung MTR Station]] and bus terminus, thus providing a focal point to the town. Citygate, developed in the glass and steel style of the Hong Kong International Airport, contains 500,000 square feet (46,000 m<sup>2</sup>) of shopping, entertainment, and food outlets spread across five floors. A square outside the mall contains a special fountain which performs a musical show regularly.\n\n'''Yat Tung''' is a newer development; the first and second phase was completed in March 2001 and May 2002 respectively. It provides supermarkets, services, and a number of eating outlets.\n\nBoth Asian and Western cuisines are available at the many restaurants in Tung Chung, including Chinese, Vietnamese, Italian, American, Thai, Japanese, and Korean.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} It is also possible to have a meal at a temple behind the [[Tung Chung Battery]] and at a restaurant in [[Po Lin Monastery]] which serves vegetarian food.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\nNear the [[Ngong Ping 360|Ngong Ping cable car]] terminal, there are restaurants and bars offering Asian and European dishes.\n\n==Sights and attractions==\n\n===Tung Chung Fort===\n[[File:Tung chung fort.jpg|frame|Tung Chung Fort, Lantau, Hong Kong]]\n[[Tung Chung Fort]] was built in 1817, when the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] Government was alarmed by the rampant [[pirate|piracy]] of [[Cheung Po Tsai]] (though Cheung himself had been captured seven years earlier) and decided to intervene and thwart the [[opium trade]] and defend the coast from pirates. The Fort was [[Declared monuments of Hong Kong|declared a monument]] in 1979. There are 6 old muzzle-loading cannons (still intact), each resting on a cement base and the enclosures are made of [[granite]] blocks, measuring 70 by 80 meters. Three arched gateways, each engraved with a Chinese inscription, are spaced along the walls. Tung Chung Fort itself went through several transformations. It was first used as a police station and then as a secondary school. Now, it is the base for the Rural Committee Office and the Tung Chung Public School.\n\n===Hau Wong Temple===\n[[Image: Hau Wong Temple, Tung Chung.jpg|thumb|Hau Wong Temple]]\n[[Hau Wong Temple]], a tiered-roof structure built in 1765, is dedicated to [[Yeung Hau]], a loyal court official of the [[Song Dynasty]] who died with [[Emperor Bing of Song China|its last emperor]]. And this temple was a place for training soldiers in the Qing Dynasty. There is a stele founded in 1777, which is an important product of culture for researches about the Qing Dynasty. Recently renovated, the temple features lavish interior decorations. The temple is over 200 years old. The row of miniature human figures on the eaves looks still very real to life. On the 18th of the eighth month in the [[lunar calendar]] every year, there are activities such as [[Chinese opera]]s and gatherings in the open area of the temple, to celebrate the birthday of Hau Wong.\n\nThe temple is twenty minutes walking distance from the train station.\n\n===Tin Hau Temple===\nA [[Tin Hau Temple]] is located in [[Chek Lap Kok New Village]], Wong Lung Hang Road, Tung Chung. The temple was initially built in 1823 at the north east of [[Chek Lap Kok]]. It was dismantled in 1991 because of the construction of [[Hong Kong International Airport|the new airport]], and was rebuilt in 1994 at its present location.<ref>[http://www.islandsdc.gov.hk/index.php?action=sight&did=2&sid=8 Exploring Islands - Tung Chung] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BiSuxpGc?url=http://www.islandsdc.gov.hk/index.php?action=sight |date=27 October 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"1444 HB\">[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/AAB_brief_info_en.pdf Antiquities and Monuments Offices - Introduction to 1444 Historic Buildings] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013022841/http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/AAB_brief_info_en.pdf |date=13 October 2012 }}</ref> It is a [[List of Grade I historic buildings in Hong Kong|Grade I historic building]].<ref name=\"AMO\">[http://www.amo.gov.hk/form/historical.pdf List of Graded Historic Buildings in Hong Kong (as at 6 November 2009)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709224215/http://www.amo.gov.hk/form/historical.pdf |date=9 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Tung Chung Battery===\n[[File: Tung Chung Battery, 2013-09-08.jpg|thumb|Tung Chung Battery]]\n[[Tung Chung Battery]] was one of the two military forts built in 1817 at the foot of the [[Rocky Lion Hill]] at Tung Chung according to the Guangdong Annals. Its remains were discovered on a hill slope facing the sea near Tung Chung pier in 1980. An L-shaped wall with a platform at the corner, probably for gun emplacements, was revealed after clearing the dense undergrowth.\n\n===Lo Hon Temple===\n[[Lo Hon Monastery]], at [[Shek Mun Kap]]. Built by lay Buddhists in 1974, it occupies the site of a grotto named Lo Hon Cavern where a hermit from [[Guangdong]] practiced [[Buddhism]] in 1926.\n\n===Ngong Ping: Big Buddha, Po Lin Monastery and Ngong Ping 360===\n[[Image:Hong Kong Budha.jpg|thumb|200px|Big Buddha]]\n\nTung Chung serves as the gateway for those wishing to explore [[Ngong Ping]]'s [[Tian Tan Buddha|Big Buddha]], the world's largest seated outdoor bronze Buddha statue; and [[Po Lin Monastery]].\n\nNgong Ping can be reached by:\n* The [[Ngong Ping 360]] cable car\n* Buses from Tung Chung Town Centre; plying between Tung Chung and Ngong Ping via Tung Chung Road and South Lantau Highway\n* Hiking trail\n\n==Nature==\n[[File:Tung Chung River (Hong Kong).jpg|thumb|220px|Tung Chung River]]\nTung Chung is surrounded by two large [[Hong Kong Country Parks & Special Areas|country parks]], cover an area of Lantau Island as large as Hong Kong Island: The [[Lantau North Country Park|Lantau North]] and [[Lantau South Country Park|Lantau South]] Country Parks.\n\nThe presence of [[mangrove]]s and freshwater streams in Tung Chung provides excellent ecologically valuable habitats for freshwater fish species, [[dragonflies]] and rare [[amphibia]]ns.\n\nHowever, the reclamation and other civil engineering works in Tung Chung has heavily damaged these habitats and produced irreversible damage to native wildlife and the surrounding environment.\n\n===Tung Chung Valley===\nThe hiking route begins at [[Ngong Ping]], from the [[Tian Tan Buddha|Big Buddha]] follow signs for [[Lantau Peak]]. The total length is 8&nbsp; km. The route winds around the northern slopes of Lantau Peak and descends into Tung Chung Valley. The trail passes woodland, mountain streams and also hillside monasteries. The impressive views over [[Shek Pik]] make a strong contrast with the airport which is seen in the distance. Side paths skirt the small monasteries seen along the way. All around are natural hillsides, rich with life forms, some of them rare.\n\nTung Chung Valley is the home of some of the steepest and most primeval mountain streams in Hong Kong. The formation of spectacular [[waterfall]]s is facilitated in the presence of the sheer cliffs and deep gorges in the valley.\n\nAlmost all the streams in the area have their name related to ''Lung'' (the Chinese word for ''[[Chinese dragon|dragon]]'') which is the [[Chinese mythology|Chinese mythological creature]] of the waters and the favorite metaphor for the towering waterfalls.\n\nBeing the main branch of the Tung Chung Valley, the deep-set [[Wong Lung Valley]] is the home of the Wong Lung Stream (The Yellow Dragon). The mainstream has its source on the saddle at the east of [[Sunset Peak (Hong Kong)|Sunset Peak]], but the stream collects water through a large network of feeder streams on both sides of the valley, including the famous Tung-Lung, Pak-Lung, Chong-Lung, and Ngo-Lung Streams, which are known collectively as \"The Five Dragons of Tung Chung\".\n\n===Wong Lung Waterfall===\nWong Lung Waterfall is located in the [[Lantau North Country Park]]. It is named \"Wong-Lung\" since, during a heavy rainstorm, when we view from the high ground, the stream resembles a yellow dragon ready to take off for heaven when it and its feeders are flooded with torrential muddy water, with Wong-Lung as the trunk and the feeders its limbs.\n\n===Tung-Lung Stream===\nTung-Lung Stream spectacular stream that falls seemingly joined together by the torrential water to form continuous fals of more than 700 feet (213 m). Tung-Lung Stream is rich in varieties of rare local wild plants and animals, especially in the primeval forest at an upper stream, among them the unique Hong Kong [[newt]]s (''Paramesotriton hongkongensis'') as well as several species of wild [[orchid]]s.\n\n===Tung Chung Stream===\nTung Chung Stream is the only known Hong Kong site for the rare [[fish]], [[Acrossocheilus (Lissolichthys) wenchowensis beijiangensis]] (\u5317\u6c5f\u5149\u5507\u9b5a) and one of only two sites on Lantau where the locally rare [[crested kingfisher]], ''Megaceryle lugubris'', has been recorded.\n\n===Upper Tung Chung Valley===\nThe upper Tung Chung Valley is an important habitat for [[bird]]s, including thrushes and warblers (Hopkin, pers. comm.). Eagle owls, a species highly sensitive to a disturbance around their nesting sites, breed here (Wilson, pers. comm.). The locally rare [[Hainan blue flycatcher]] probably breeds here (Chalmers, pers. comm.). The largest population of the reptile [[tokay gecko]], ''Gekko gecko'', occurs in the cliffs and boulder crevices in upper Tung Chung Valley (Lau, pers. comm.).\n\nThe woods in the upper Tung Chung Valley are reported to be some of the best on Lantau for rare plant species and for butterflies, including the [[birdwing butterfly]] which breeds here (Reels, pers. comm.).\n\n===Hiking trails===\nHiking trails link Tung Chung to the fishing village of [[Tai O]]. This trail follows the north-western coast of Lantau Island; providing a view of the runway approach to Chek Lap Kok as well as a number of villages and local scenery.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} This, however is a strenuous four-hour trek.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nAn easier and well-wooded walk with picnic and barbecue sites also link [[Shui Hau]] to Tung Chung Road. Turning south from Tung Chung Road, visitors can get to the [[Beaches of Hong Kong|Cheung Sha beaches]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Hong Kong Buddhist Youth Camp===\nLocated on a 4,877&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> site near Tung Chung, the Buddhist Youth Camp enables youth and families to share and experience life in a peaceful and natural environment.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}{{tone inline|date=January 2019}} Built in 1979 for HK$3 million, the camp is run by the [[Hong Kong Buddhist Association]].

Administratively, Tung Chung is part of [[Islands District]].\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==History==\n===Early times===\nSince the [[Song Dynasty]] between 960\u20131279 AD, there have been people living in Tung Chung. At that time, they lived on fishing and agriculture. Crabs, fishes and crops were their main productions.\n\nThis place was originally called ''Tung Sai Chung'', when Hong Kong was still a group of fishing villages. ''Tung'' means ''east'' in [[Cantonese]], while ''Sai'' means ''west''. At that time, merchandising ships sailed east to the village and west to [[Macau]].\n\nTung Chung may be a new town, but its heritage can be seen in the form of old fishing villages. They show another fa\u00e7ade of Tung Chung, of a village before the development of the airport and the town.\n\n=== New town development ===\nIn the 1990s, Tung Chung was developed as a [[New towns of Hong Kong|new town]]. This was undertaken as part of the [[Airport Core Programme]], a package of development and infrastructure projects surrounding the relocation of [[Hong Kong International Airport|Hong Kong's international airport]] from [[Kai Tak Airport|Kai Tak]] to [[Chek Lap Kok]], adjacent to Tung Chung. Tung Chung New Town was intended to serve as a supporting community for the new airport.<ref name=\"napcotungchungph1\">{{cite web|title=Tung Chung New Town (Phase 1)|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/archive/napco/p-tung.html|website=Hong Kong Airport Core Programme|publisher=New Airport Projects Co-ordination Office|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the information from the Hong Kong [[Territory Development Department]], Tung Chung is being developed in four phases into a new town with a target population of 250,000 people. The first phase was completed in 1994; infrastructure works was completed in January 1997 in order to tie with the subsequent completion of the first housing developments. This phase of development provided about 20,000 people in the district to support the airport at [[Chek Lap Kok]].\n\nPhase 2 of Tung Chung development was also completed. About 350,000 square metres of [[Land reclamation in Hong Kong|land was reclaimed]] east of the Phase 1 development area. Roads and drainage works to serve this reclaimed land were completed in May 2000. Land formation of 270,000 m<sup>2</sup> for the remaining Phase 2 areas south of [[Tung Chung Bay]] together with the associated infrastructure were completed in February 2001. Upon completion, Phase 2 development will accommodate a population of 67,000.\n\nReclamation works under Phase 3A development commenced in March 1999 and were completed in April 2003. About 260,000 m<sup>2</sup> of land was reclaimed north-east of Phase I development area. The reclamation will provide land for housing developments to accommodate a population of about 22,000.\n\nThe remaining development in Tung Chung is planned to be implemented as Phases 3 and 4 and to be completed in a foreseeable future.\n\nCurrently, Tung Chung is primarily residential, but an office block and hotel have already been completed. It is envisaged that in the future, other commercial projects will be developed in Tung Chung to support the growing population.\n\n==Housing==\n[[Image:Caribbean Square Bermuda Park 2016.jpg|thumb|right|Private housing estates in Tung Chung New Town]]\n[[File:Yat Tung Estate 1.jpg|thumb|Yat Tung Estate viewed across [[Tung Chung Bay]], with [[Sunset Peak (Hong Kong)|Sunset Peak]] in the background]]\nTung Chung New Town (Phase 1) is the newly developed core living area around Tung Chung.

Further shopping malls are expected at the new developments in '''Caribbean Coast'''. Tung Chung is 12 minutes from [[Tsing Yi]] and [[Kwai Tsing]], where a much wider variety of shopping options are available.\n\nCitygate Outlets is at the heart of this new town, developed in conjunction with the [[Tung Chung Station (MTR)|Tung Chung MTR Station]] and bus terminus, thus providing a focal point to the town. Citygate, developed in the glass and steel style of the Hong Kong International Airport, contains 500,000 square feet (46,000 m<sup>2</sup>) of shopping, entertainment, and food outlets spread across five floors.

The Fort was [[Declared monuments of Hong Kong|declared a monument]] in 1979. There are 6 old muzzle-loading cannons (still intact), each resting on a cement base and the enclosures are made of [[granite]] blocks, measuring 70 by 80 meters. Three arched gateways, each engraved with a Chinese inscription, are spaced along the walls. Tung Chung Fort itself went through several transformations. It was first used as a police station and then as a secondary school. Now, it is the base for the Rural Committee Office and the Tung Chung Public School.\n\n===Hau Wong Temple===\n[[Image: Hau Wong Temple, Tung Chung.jpg|thumb|Hau Wong Temple]]\n[[Hau Wong Temple]], a tiered-roof structure built in 1765, is dedicated to [[Yeung Hau]], a loyal court official of the [[Song Dynasty]] who died with [[Emperor Bing of Song China|its last emperor]]. And this temple was a place for training soldiers in the Qing Dynasty. There is a stele founded in 1777, which is an important product of culture for researches about the Qing Dynasty. Recently renovated, the temple features lavish interior decorations. The temple is over 200 years old. The row of miniature human figures on the eaves looks still very real to life. On the 18th of the eighth month in the [[lunar calendar]] every year, there are activities such as [[Chinese opera]]s and gatherings in the open area of the temple, to celebrate the birthday of Hau Wong.\n\nThe temple is twenty minutes walking distance from the train station.\n\n===Tin Hau Temple===\nA [[Tin Hau Temple]] is located in [[Chek Lap Kok New Village]], Wong Lung Hang Road, Tung Chung. The temple was initially built in 1823 at the north east of [[Chek Lap Kok]]. It was dismantled in 1991 because of the construction of [[Hong Kong International Airport|the new airport]], and was rebuilt in 1994 at its present location.<ref>[http://www.islandsdc.gov.hk/index.php?action=sight&did=2&sid=8 Exploring Islands - Tung Chung] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BiSuxpGc?url=http://www.islandsdc.gov.hk/index.php?action=sight |date=27 October 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"1444 HB\">[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/AAB_brief_info_en.pdf Antiquities and Monuments Offices - Introduction to 1444 Historic Buildings] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013022841/http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/AAB_brief_info_en.pdf |date=13 October 2012 }}</ref> It is a [[List of Grade I historic buildings in Hong Kong|Grade I historic building]].<ref name=\"AMO\">[http://www.amo.gov.hk/form/historical.pdf List of Graded Historic Buildings in Hong Kong (as at 6 November 2009)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709224215/http://www.amo.gov.hk/form/historical.pdf |date=9 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Tung Chung Battery===\n[[File: Tung Chung Battery, 2013-09-08.jpg|thumb|Tung Chung Battery]]\n[[Tung Chung Battery]] was one of the two military forts built in 1817 at the foot of the [[Rocky Lion Hill]] at Tung Chung according to the Guangdong Annals. Its remains were discovered on a hill slope facing the sea near Tung Chung pier in 1980. An L-shaped wall with a platform at the corner, probably for gun emplacements, was revealed after clearing the dense undergrowth.\n\n===Lo Hon Temple===\n[[Lo Hon Monastery]], at [[Shek Mun Kap]]. Built by lay Buddhists in 1974, it occupies the site of a grotto named Lo Hon Cavern where a hermit from [[Guangdong]] practiced [[Buddhism]] in 1926.\n\n===Ngong Ping: Big Buddha, Po Lin Monastery and Ngong Ping 360===\n[[Image:Hong Kong Budha.jpg|thumb|200px|Big Buddha]]\n\nTung Chung serves as the gateway for those wishing to explore [[Ngong Ping]]'s [[Tian Tan Buddha|Big Buddha]], the world's largest seated outdoor bronze Buddha statue; and [[Po Lin Monastery]].\n\nNgong Ping can be reached by:\n* The [[Ngong Ping 360]] cable car\n* Buses from Tung Chung Town Centre; plying between Tung Chung and Ngong Ping via Tung Chung Road and South Lantau Highway\n* Hiking trail\n\n==Nature==\n[[File:Tung Chung River (Hong Kong).jpg|thumb|220px|Tung Chung River]]\nTung Chung is surrounded by two large [[Hong Kong Country Parks & Special Areas|country parks]], cover an area of Lantau Island as large as Hong Kong Island: The [[Lantau North Country Park|Lantau North]] and [[Lantau South Country Park|Lantau South]] Country Parks.\n\nThe presence of [[mangrove]]s and freshwater streams in Tung Chung provides excellent ecologically valuable habitats for freshwater fish species, [[dragonflies]] and rare [[amphibia]]ns.\n\nHowever, the reclamation and other civil engineering works in Tung Chung has heavily damaged these habitats and produced irreversible damage to native wildlife and the surrounding environment.\n\n===Tung Chung Valley===\nThe hiking route begins at [[Ngong Ping]], from the [[Tian Tan Buddha|Big Buddha]] follow signs for [[Lantau Peak]]. The total length is 8&nbsp; km. The route winds around the northern slopes of Lantau Peak and descends into Tung Chung Valley. The trail passes woodland, mountain streams and also hillside monasteries. The impressive views over [[Shek Pik]] make a strong contrast with the airport which is seen in the distance. Side paths skirt the small monasteries seen along the way. All around are natural hillsides, rich with life forms, some of them rare.\n\nTung Chung Valley is the home of some of the steepest and most primeval mountain streams in Hong Kong. The formation of spectacular [[waterfall]]s is facilitated in the presence of the sheer cliffs and deep gorges in the valley.\n\nAlmost all the streams in the area have their name related to ''Lung'' (the Chinese word for ''[[Chinese dragon|dragon]]'') which is the [[Chinese mythology|Chinese mythological creature]] of the waters and the favorite metaphor for the towering waterfalls.\n\nBeing the main branch of the Tung Chung Valley, the deep-set [[Wong Lung Valley]] is the home of the Wong Lung Stream (The Yellow Dragon). The mainstream has its source on the saddle at the east of [[Sunset Peak (Hong Kong)|Sunset Peak]], but the stream collects water through a large network of feeder streams on both sides of the valley, including the famous Tung-Lung, Pak-Lung, Chong-Lung, and Ngo-Lung Streams, which are known collectively as \"The Five Dragons of Tung Chung\".\n\n===Wong Lung Waterfall===\nWong Lung Waterfall is located in the [[Lantau North Country Park]]. It is named \"Wong-Lung\" since, during a heavy rainstorm, when we view from the high ground, the stream resembles a yellow dragon ready to take off for heaven when it and its feeders are flooded with torrential muddy water, with Wong-Lung as the trunk and the feeders its limbs.\n\n===Tung-Lung Stream===\nTung-Lung Stream spectacular stream that falls seemingly joined together by the torrential water to form continuous fals of more than 700 feet (213 m). Tung-Lung Stream is rich in varieties of rare local wild plants and animals, especially in the primeval forest at an upper stream, among them the unique Hong Kong [[newt]]s (''Paramesotriton hongkongensis'') as well as several species of wild [[orchid]]s.\n\n===Tung Chung Stream===\nTung Chung Stream is the only known Hong Kong site for the rare [[fish]], [[Acrossocheilus (Lissolichthys) wenchowensis beijiangensis]] (\u5317\u6c5f\u5149\u5507\u9b5a) and one of only two sites on Lantau where the locally rare [[crested kingfisher]], ''Megaceryle lugubris'', has been recorded.\n\n===Upper Tung Chung Valley===\nThe upper Tung Chung Valley is an important habitat for [[bird]]s, including thrushes and warblers (Hopkin, pers. comm.). Eagle owls, a species highly sensitive to a disturbance around their nesting sites, breed here (Wilson, pers. comm.). The locally rare [[Hainan blue flycatcher]] probably breeds here (Chalmers, pers. comm.). The largest population of the reptile [[tokay gecko]], ''Gekko gecko'', occurs in the cliffs and boulder crevices in upper Tung Chung Valley (Lau, pers. comm.).\n\nThe woods in the upper Tung Chung Valley are reported to be some of the best on Lantau for rare plant species and for butterflies, including the [[birdwing butterfly]] which breeds here (Reels, pers. comm.).\n\n===Hiking trails===\nHiking trails link Tung Chung to the fishing village of [[Tai O]]. This trail follows the north-western coast of Lantau Island; providing a view of the runway approach to Chek Lap Kok as well as a number of villages and local scenery.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} This, however is a strenuous four-hour trek.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nAn easier and well-wooded walk with picnic and barbecue sites also link [[Shui Hau]] to Tung Chung Road. Turning south from Tung Chung Road, visitors can get to the [[Beaches of Hong Kong|Cheung Sha beaches]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Hong Kong Buddhist Youth Camp===\nLocated on a 4,877&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> site near Tung Chung, the Buddhist Youth Camp enables youth and families to share and experience life in a peaceful and natural environment.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}{{tone inline|date=January 2019}} Built in 1979 for HK$3 million, the camp is run by the [[Hong Kong Buddhist Association]].

These charities became incorporated into a scheme led by [[James Oglethorpe]] to establish a charitable colony for the poor, 'honest industrious debtors' and persecuted ([[Protestant]]) foreigners.

Hales was also active in the movement to promote the [[Gin Act 1736]]. He wrote a number of anonymous tracts against the consumption of [[gin]] and [[Distilled beverage|distilled spirits]], most notably 'A Friendly Admonition to the Drinker of Brandy and other Distilled Spirituous Liquors'.  and also lobbied Parliament.
