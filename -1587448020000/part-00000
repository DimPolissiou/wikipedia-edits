Born to a Jewish family in what is now [[Israel]], he moved to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1947 and by the end of the 1950s had assumed the pen name of Tony Cliff. A founding member of the Socialist Review Group, which became the International Socialists and then the  [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]], in 1977, Cliff was effectively the leader of all three.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n{{Trotskyism}}\nTony Cliff was born Yigael Gl\u00fcckstein in [[Zikhron Ya'akov]] in the Ottoman Empire's [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem]] (now part of [[Israel]]), in 1917, the same year Britain seized control of the territory from the Ottoman Empire during [[World War I]].  He was one of four children born to Akiva and Esther Gl\u00fcckstein, Jewish immigrants from [[Poland]], who had come to Palestine as part of the [[Second Aliyah]]. His father was an engineer and contractor. He had two brothers and a sister; his brother Chaim later became a notable journalist, theatre critic, and translator. Through his sister Alexandra, he was the uncle of Israeli graphic designer [[David Tartakover]]. Cliff grew up in British-ruled [[Mandatory Palestine]]; notable [[Zionism|Zionist]] and future [[Prime Minister of Israel|Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Moshe Sharett]] was a family friend and frequent visitor to his family home. He had two prominent uncles: the noted doctor [[Hillel Yaffe]] and agronomist; and Zionist activist Chaim Margaliot Kalvarisky. His piano teacher was a sister of [[Chaim Weizmann]], the first [[President of Israel]], and his father's business partner was one of Weizmann's brothers.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NcaN0eYh7ckC&dq=Tony+Cliff+Hebrew+University+of+Jerusalem&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Israel and the European Left: Between Solidarity and Delegitimization|last=Shindler|first=Colin|date=2011-12-22|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|isbn=9781441138521|language=en}}</ref> \n\nHe attended school in [[Jerusalem]], then studied at the [[Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology|Technion]] in [[Haifa]], before dropping out and studying economics at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. In his youth, he came to identify with [[Communism]], though he never joined the [[Communist Party of Palestine]], as he had not met any of its members before becoming a [[Socialism|socialist activist]]. However, he did join the [[Socialist Zionist|socialist-Zionist]] youth movement [[Hashomer Hatzair]], and soon became not only a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] in 1933, but also a confirmed opponent of [[Zionism]]. Along with other Hashomer Hatzair members, he joined the illegal Palestine [[Revolutionary Communist League (Palestine)|Revolutionary Communist League]], necessitating the use of several pseudonyms in three languages.\n\nWith the beginning of [[World War II]], Gl\u00fcckstein was active in efforts to oppose mobilization of Jews to the British war effort,  seeing the war as a struggle between imperialists. He was arrested by the British and imprisoned for the duration of the war. After his release he met his wife [[Chanie Rosenberg]], a Jewish immigrant from South Africa, and they moved in together in [[Tel Aviv]] in 1945. They moved to Britain in 1947, but Cliff was never able to become a [[British citizen]] and remained a [[stateless person]] for the rest of his life. To the end of his life he spoke English with a distinct Israeli accent. He was deported by the British authorities and lived in the [[Republic of Ireland]] for several years. During this period, he was active in left-wing circles in [[Dublin]], and was acquainted with [[Owen Sheehy-Skeffington]] and his wife, Andr\u00e9e.<ref>Andr\u00e9e Sheehy-Skeffington, ''Skeff: The Life of Owen Sheehy-Skeffington, 1909-1970'' (Lilliput Press, 1991), p. 101.</ref> He was permitted to take up British residency due only to the status of his wife Chanie as a British citizen. Living in [[London]], Gl\u00fcckstein again became active with the [[Revolutionary Communist Party (1944-1949)|Revolutionary Communist Party]], on to the leadership of which he had been co-opted. For most purposes, Gl\u00fcckstein was a supporter of the leadership of the RCP around [[Jock Haston]],<ref>The War and the International: A History of the British Trotskyist Movement, 1937\u20131949 (with Al Richardson), Socialist Platform, London 1986.</ref> and as such he was involved with the discussions concerning the nature of those states dominated by [[Russia]] and the Communist parties initiated by a faction within the RCP. This debate was linked to other discussions on the nationalised industries in Britain and the increasingly critical stance of Haston and the RCP as to the leadership of the [[Fourth International]] with regard to [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Tito's Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] in particular.\n\nOn the break-up of the RCP, Gl\u00fcckstein\u2019s supporters joined [[Gerry Healy]]'s group [[The Club (Trotskyist)|The Club]] although, having been deported to Ireland, Gl\u00fcckstein himself did not. In 1950, he helped launch the ''[[Socialist Review]]'' Group, which was based on a journal of the same name. This was to be the main publication for which Gl\u00fcckstein wrote during the 1950s, until it was superseded by ''[[International Socialism (magazine)|International Socialism]]'' in 1960, eventually ceasing publication altogether in 1962.\n\nBy the time he gained permanent residency in Britain his supporters in The Club had been expelled due to differences on [[Birmingham Trades Council]] regarding socialist policy concerning the [[war in Korea]], where Gl\u00fcckstein's co-factionalists refused to take a position of support for either side in the war.\n\nOwing to his lack of established residency rights in Britain, and during his earlier exile in Ireland, Gl\u00fcckstein used the name Roger or Roger Tennant as a [[pseudonym]]. The first edition of his short book on [[Rosa Luxemburg]] in 1959 was possibly the first use of the pen name 'Tony Cliff'. In the 1960s, Cliff would revive many of his earlier pseudonyms in the pages of ''International Socialism'' in which journal reviews are to be found by Roger, Roger Tennant, Sakhry, Lee Rock and Tony Cliff, but none by Yigael or Yg'al Gl\u00fcckstein.\n\nGl\u00fcckstein\u2019s group was renamed the [[International Socialists (UK)|International Socialists]] in 1962, and was to grow from fewer than 100 members in 1960 until it claimed in the region of 3,000 in 1977, at which point it was renamed the [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP). Cliff remained a leading member until his death in 2000. He was central to the various reorientations carried out in the SWP to react to changes in the position of the working class. In particular, after the high level of strike activity in the early seventies, he argued in the late seventies that the working class movement was entering a \"downturn\" and that the party's activity should be radically changed as a result. A fierce debate ensued, which Cliff's side eventually won. Trotskyist writer [[Samuel Farber]], a long-time supporter of the [[International Socialist Organization]] in the US, has argued that the internal party regime established by Cliff during this period is \"reminiscent of the one established by [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]] in the mid-twenties in the USSR\" consequently leading to the various crises and splits in the group later on.<ref>{{cite web|last=Farber|first=Samuel|title=Tony Cliff as a Socialist Leader|url=http://www.solidarity-us.org/node/3989|publisher=Solidarity|accessdate=31 January 2014|date=8 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nCliff's biography is, as he himself remarked, inseparable from that of the groups of which he was a leading member.\n\nShortly before his death he underwent a major surgical operation on his heart.<ref>[[#Bir10|Birchall 2010]].</ref>\n\n== Ideology ==\n\nCliff was a revolutionary socialist in the Trotskyist tradition, attempting to make Lenin's theory of the party effective in the present day. Much of his theoretical writing was aimed at immediate tasks of the party at the time.\n\nSince then, the consensus in most Trotskyist groups has been that all the states dominated by [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] parties \u2013 which are characterised by state planning and state ownership of property \u2013 are to be seen as '[[degenerated workers state|degenerated workers' states]]' (The Soviet Union) or '[[deformed workers state|deformed workers' states]]' (other Stalinist states, including much of Eastern Europe). In many ways, Cliff was the main dissident from this idea, although some of his opponents have sought to associate his state capitalist view with other ideas: for example, the theory of '[[bureaucratic collectivism]]' associated with [[Shachtmanism|Shachtmanite]] [[Workers Party (US)|Workers Party]] in the United States. However, Cliff himself was insistent that his ideas owed nothing to those of [[Max Shachtman]], or earlier proponents of the theory such as [[Bruno Rizzi]], and made this clear in his work ''Bureaucratic Collectivism \u2013 A Critique.'' \n\nNevertheless, in the 1950s, his group distributed literature published by Shachtman's group and the theory of the '[[permanent arms economy]]', which was considered one of the pillars of what became the International Socialist Tendency, and originated with Shachtman's group, though it is sometimes claimed that Cliff refused to acknowledge this publicly.<ref>This allegation seems to have originated from [[Jim Higgins (British politician)|Jim Higgins]] in his booklet ''[http://www.marxists.org/archive/higgins/1997/locust/index.htm More Years for the Locusts]'', but it would seem to be contradicted by the fact that ''International Socialism'', Nos. 47 and 49 carried prominent ads for the book '''The Permanent War Economy''' by T.N. Vance, who is now acknowledged to be the originator of the theory. Both Higgins and Cliff are listed in [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/index2.html#isj049 No. 49] as editors of that issue.</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nCliff had little or no time for any activities not directly linked to the needs of building his party (with the exception of caring for his family). He did not drink or smoke, or socialise very much. Cliff's wife, [[Chanie Rosenberg]], was an active member successively of the SRG, IS and SWP, in which she remains active. As well as authoring many articles on social questions for the group's publications, she was an activist in the [[National Union of Teachers]] until her retirement. In addition, three of the couple's four children became members of the SWP, with one son, [[Donny Gluckstein]], co-authoring two books with his father.\n\nCliff is depicted as Jimmy Rock of the Rockers in [[Tariq Ali]]'s satire ''[[Redemption (1990 novel)|Redemption]]''.\n\n==Selected works==\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1946/probme/index.html ''The Problem of the Middle East''] (1946)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1948/stalruss/index.htm ''The Nature of Stalinist Russia''] (1948)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1952/stalsats/index.htm ''Stalin's Satallites in Europe''] (1952)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1955/statecap/index.htm ''Stalinist Russia: A Marxist Analysis''] (1955)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1957/05/permwar.htm ''Perspectives of the Permanent War Economy''] (1957)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1957/06/rootsref.htm ''Economic Roots of Reformism''] (1957)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1959/rosalux/index.htm ''Rosa Luxemburg: A Study''](1959)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1960/xx/trotsub.htm ''Trotsky on Substitionism''] (1960)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1963/xx/permrev.htm ''Deflected Permanent Revolution''] (1963)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1966/incomespol/index.htm ''Incomes Policy, Legislation and Shop Stewards''] (with [[Colin Barker]]) (1966)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1968/france/index.htm ''France: The Struggle Goes On''] (with [[Ian Birchall]]) (1968)\n*''The Employers\u2019 Offensive, Productivity Deals and how to fight them'' (1970)\n*''The Crisis: Social Contract or Socialism'' (1975)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1975/lenin1/index.htm ''Lenin Vol. 1: Building the Party''] (1975)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1975/portugal/index.htm ''Portugal at the Crossroads''] (1975)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1976/lenin2/index.htm ''Lenin Vol. 2: All Power to the Soviets''] (1976)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1978/lenin3/index.html ''Lenin Vol. 3: Revolution Besieged''] (1978)\n*''Lenin Vol. 4: The Bolsheviks and World Communism'' (1979)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1984/women/index.htm ''Class Struggle and Women\u2019s Liberation, 1640 to today''] (1984)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1986/tradeunion/index.htm ''Marxism and trade union struggle, the general strike of 1926''] (with [[Donny Gluckstein]]) (1986)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1988/labour/index.html'' The Labour Party, A Marxist History''] (with [[Donny Gluckstein]]) (1986)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1989/trotsky1/index.html ''Trotsky Vol. 1: Towards October 1879-1917''] (1989)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1990/trotsky2/index.html ''Trotsky Vol. 2: The Sword of the Revolution 1917-1923''] (1990)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1991/trotsky3/index.html ''Trotsky Vol. 3: Fighting the Rising Stalinist Bureaucracy 1923-1927''] (1991)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1993/trotsky4/index.html ''Trotsky Vol. 4: The darker the Night, the Brighter the Star 1927-1940''] (1993)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1999/trotism/index.htm ''Trotskyism after Trotsky, the origins of the International Socialists''] (1999)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/2000/wtw/index.htm ''A World to Win: Life of a Revolutionary''] (2000)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/2000/millennium/index.htm ''Marxism at the Millennium''] (2000)\n\n== Archives ==\n\n* '''A Summary Description of the Tony Cliff papers''' held at the Modern Records Centre, [[University of Warwick]] Library.

Trotskyist writer [[Samuel Farber]], a long-time supporter of the [[International Socialist Organization]] in the US, has argued that the internal party regime established by Cliff during this period is \"reminiscent of the one established by [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]] in the mid-twenties in the USSR\" consequently leading to the various crises and splits in the group later on.<ref>{{cite web|last=Farber|first=Samuel|title=Tony Cliff as a Socialist Leader|url=http://www.solidarity-us.org/node/3989|publisher=Solidarity|accessdate=31 January 2014|date=8 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nCliff's biography is, as he himself remarked, inseparable from that of the groups of which he was a leading member.\n\nShortly before his death he underwent a major surgical operation on his heart.<ref>[[#Bir10|Birchall 2010]].</ref>\n\n== Ideology ==\n\nCliff was a revolutionary socialist in the Trotskyist tradition, attempting to make Lenin's theory of the party effective in the present day. Much of his theoretical writing was aimed at immediate tasks of the party at the time.\n\nSince then, the consensus in most Trotskyist groups has been that all the states dominated by [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] parties \u2013 which are characterised by state planning and state ownership of property \u2013 are to be seen as '[[degenerated workers state|degenerated workers' states]]' (The Soviet Union) or '[[deformed workers state|deformed workers' states]]' (other Stalinist states, including much of Eastern Europe). In many ways, Cliff was the main dissident from this idea, although some of his opponents have sought to associate his state capitalist view with other ideas: for example, the theory of '[[bureaucratic collectivism]]' associated with [[Shachtmanism|Shachtmanite]] [[Workers Party (US)|Workers Party]] in the United States. However, Cliff himself was insistent that his ideas owed nothing to those of [[Max Shachtman]], or earlier proponents of the theory such as [[Bruno Rizzi]], and made this clear in his work ''Bureaucratic Collectivism \u2013 A Critique.'' \n\nNevertheless, in the 1950s, his group distributed literature published by Shachtman's group and the theory of the '[[permanent arms economy]]', which was considered one of the pillars of what became the International Socialist Tendency, and originated with Shachtman's group, though it is sometimes claimed that Cliff refused to acknowledge this publicly.<ref>This allegation seems to have originated from [[Jim Higgins (British politician)|Jim Higgins]] in his booklet ''[http://www.marxists.org/archive/higgins/1997/locust/index.htm More Years for the Locusts]'', but it would seem to be contradicted by the fact that ''International Socialism'', Nos. 47 and 49 carried prominent ads for the book '''The Permanent War Economy''' by T.N. Vance, who is now acknowledged to be the originator of the theory. Both Higgins and Cliff are listed in [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/index2.html#isj049 No. 49] as editors of that issue.</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nCliff had little or no time for any activities not directly linked to the needs of building his party (with the exception of caring for his family). He did not drink or smoke, or socialise very much. Cliff's wife, [[Chanie Rosenberg]], was an active member successively of the SRG, IS and SWP, in which she remains active. As well as authoring many articles on social questions for the group's publications, she was an activist in the [[National Union of Teachers]] until her retirement. In addition, three of the couple's four children became members of the SWP, with one son, [[Donny Gluckstein]], co-authoring two books with his father.\n\nCliff is depicted as Jimmy Rock of the Rockers in [[Tariq Ali]]'s satire ''[[Redemption (1990 novel)|Redemption]]''.\n\n==Selected works==\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1946/probme/index.html ''The Problem of the Middle East''] (1946)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1948/stalruss/index.htm ''The Nature of Stalinist Russia''] (1948)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1952/stalsats/index.htm ''Stalin's Satallites in Europe''] (1952)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1955/statecap/index.htm ''Stalinist Russia: A Marxist Analysis''] (1955)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1957/05/permwar.htm ''Perspectives of the Permanent War Economy''] (1957)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1957/06/rootsref.htm ''Economic Roots of Reformism''] (1957)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1959/rosalux/index.htm ''Rosa Luxemburg: A Study''](1959)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1960/xx/trotsub.htm ''Trotsky on Substitionism''] (1960)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1963/xx/permrev.htm ''Deflected Permanent Revolution''] (1963)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1966/incomespol/index.htm ''Incomes Policy, Legislation and Shop Stewards''] (with [[Colin Barker]]) (1966)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1968/france/index.htm ''France: The Struggle Goes On''] (with [[Ian Birchall]]) (1968)\n*''The Employers\u2019 Offensive, Productivity Deals and how to fight them'' (1970)\n*''The Crisis: Social Contract or Socialism'' (1975)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1975/lenin1/index.htm ''Lenin Vol. 1: Building the Party''] (1975)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1975/portugal/index.htm ''Portugal at the Crossroads''] (1975)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1976/lenin2/index.htm ''Lenin Vol. 2: All Power to the Soviets''] (1976)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1978/lenin3/index.html ''Lenin Vol. 3: Revolution Besieged''] (1978)\n*''Lenin Vol. 4: The Bolsheviks and World Communism'' (1979)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1984/women/index.htm ''Class Struggle and Women\u2019s Liberation, 1640 to today''] (1984)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1986/tradeunion/index.htm ''Marxism and trade union struggle, the general strike of 1926''] (with [[Donny Gluckstein]]) (1986)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1988/labour/index.html'' The Labour Party, A Marxist History''] (with [[Donny Gluckstein]]) (1986)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1989/trotsky1/index.html ''Trotsky Vol. 1: Towards October 1879-1917''] (1989)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1990/trotsky2/index.html ''Trotsky Vol. 2: The Sword of the Revolution 1917-1923''] (1990)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1991/trotsky3/index.html ''Trotsky Vol. 3: Fighting the Rising Stalinist Bureaucracy 1923-1927''] (1991)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1993/trotsky4/index.html ''Trotsky Vol. 4: The darker the Night, the Brighter the Star 1927-1940''] (1993)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1999/trotism/index.htm ''Trotskyism after Trotsky, the origins of the International Socialists''] (1999)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/2000/wtw/index.htm ''A World to Win: Life of a Revolutionary''] (2000)\n*[https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/2000/millennium/index.htm ''Marxism at the Millennium''] (2000)\n\n== Archives ==\n\n* '''A Summary Description of the Tony Cliff papers''' held at the Modern Records Centre, [[University of Warwick]] Library.

The Borg are [[Cyborg|cybernetic organisms]], linked in a [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]] called \"the Collective\". The Borg co-opt the technology and knowledge of [[List of Star Trek races|other alien species]] to the Collective through the process of \"[[#Assimilation|assimilation]]\": forcibly transforming individual beings into \"drones\" by injecting [[nanomachine|nanoprobes]] into their bodies and surgically augmenting them with cybernetic components. The Borg's ultimate goal is \"achieving perfection\".<ref name=\"auto\">Star Trek: First Contact</ref><ref>https://screenrant.com/star-trek-borg-biggest-plot-holes-make-no-sense/</ref> Aside from being recurring antagonists in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|Next Generation]]'' television series, they are depicted as the main threat in the film ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''. In addition, they played major roles in the ''[[Star Trek: Voyager|Voyager]]'' series and serve as the way home to the [[Alpha Quadrant]] for the isolated Federation [[starship]] [[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|USS ''Voyager'']].\n\nThe Borg have become a symbol in [[popular culture]] for any [[juggernaut]] against which \"resistance is futile\".\n\n==Depiction==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=March 2020}}\nThe Borg are [[cyborgs]], having outward appearances showing both mechanical and biological body parts. Individual Borg are referred to as drones and move in a robotic, purposeful style ignoring most of their environment, including beings they do not consider an immediate threat. Borg commonly have one eye replaced with a sophisticated ocular implant. Borg usually have one arm replaced with a prosthesis, bearing one of a variety of multipurpose tools in place of a humanoid hand. Since different drones have different roles, the arm may be specialized for myriad purposes such as medical devices, scanners, and weapons. Borg have flat, white skin, giving them an almost [[zombie]]-like appearance.\n\nSome Borg have been shown to be far stronger than humans, able to easily overpower most humans and similar species. Typical Borg have never been seen to run, instead moving in a deliberate fashion, never retreating.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Borg are highly resistant to energy-based weapons, having personal shielding that quickly adapts to them. In various episodes, phasers and other [[directed energy weapon]]s tend to quickly become ineffective as the Borg are able to adapt to the specific frequencies on which these weapons are projected once a ship or an individual drone is struck down by them. Later attempts to [[modulation|modulate]] phaser and other weapon frequencies have had limited success. Borg shields have, however, proven to be ineffective protection against projectile or melee weapons, but this could prove problematic, given that in space travel, puncturing the hull with an errant shot could have catastrophic consequences.\n\nBorg possess a \"cortical node\" that controls other implanted cybernetic devices within a Borg's body; it is most often implanted in the forehead above the organic eye. If the cortical node fails, the Borg eventually dies. Successful replacement of the node can be carried out on a Borg vessel.\n\n===Borg Collective===\n[[File:Borg dockingstation.jpg|thumb|An occupied Borg \"alcove\" prop on display at the Hollywood Entertainment Museum]]\nBorg civilization is based on a hive or [[Group mind (science fiction)|group mind]] known as the Collective. Each Borg drone is linked to the collective by a sophisticated [[Subspace (Star Trek)#Subspace|subspace]] network that ensures each member is given constant supervision and guidance. The mental energy of the group consciousness can help an injured or damaged drone heal or regenerate damaged body parts or technology. The collective consciousness not only gives them the ability to \"share the same thoughts\", but also to adapt with great speed to tactics used against them.<ref>\"The Best of Both Worlds, Parts I and II\" (''Stara Trek: The Next Generation'')</ref> Drones in the Collective are never seen speaking, but a collective \"voice\" is sometimes transmitted to ships.\n\n===\"Resistance is futile\"===\nIndividual Borg rarely speak, though they do send a collective audio message to their targets, stating that \"resistance is futile\", generally followed by a declaration that the target in question will be [[#Assimilation|assimilated]] and its \"biological and technological distinctiveness\" will be added to their own. The exact phrasing varies and evolves over the various series episodes and film.\n\nThe complete phrase used in ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' is: {{cquote|We are the Borg. Lower your shields and surrender your ships. We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile.<ref>[http://www.moviesoundclips.net/sound.php?id=148 ''Star Trek - First Contact'' (1996)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929181255/http://www.moviesoundclips.net/sound.php?id=148 |date=September 29, 2013 }} Moviesoundclips.net.

Retrieved September 26, 2013.</ref>}}\n\n===Nanoprobes===\nNanoprobes are [[Nanorobotics|microscopic machines]] that inhabit a Borg's body, bloodstream, and many cybernetic implants. The probes maintain the Borg cybernetic systems and repair damage to the organic parts of a Borg. They generate new technology inside a Borg when needed and protect them from many forms of disease. Borg nanoprobes, each about the size of a human [[red blood cell]], travel through the victim's bloodstream and attach to individual [[cell (biology)|cells]]. The nanoprobes rewrite the cellular [[DNA]], altering the victim's biochemistry, and eventually form larger, more complicated structures and networks within the body, like electrical pathways, processing and data-storage nodes, and ultimately prosthetic devices that spring forth from the skin. In \"[[Mortal Coil (Star Trek: Voyager)|Mortal Coil]]\", Seven of Nine states that the Borg assimilated the nanoprobe technology from \"Species 149\". In addition, the nanoprobes maintain and repair their host's mechanical and biological components on a microscopic level, imparting regenerative capabilities.\n\nThough used by the Borg to exert control over another being, reprogrammed nanoprobes were used by the crew of the starship ''Voyager'' in many instances as medical aids.\n\nThe capability of nanoprobes to absorb improved technologies they find into the Borg collective is shown in the ''Voyager'' episode \"[[Drone (Star Trek: Voyager)|Drone]]\", where [[Seven of Nine]]'s nanoprobes are fused with the Doctor's mobile emitter that uses technology from the 29th century, creating a 29th-century drone existing outside the Collective, with capabilities far surpassing that of the 24th-century drones.\n\nThe Borg do not try to immediately assimilate any being with which they come into contact; Borg drones tend to completely ignore individuals that are identified as too weak to be an imminent threat or too inferior to be worth assimilating. Captain Picard and his team walk safely past a group of Borg drones in a scene from the film ''Star Trek: First Contact'' while the drones fulfill a programmed mission. In the ''Star Trek: Voyager'' episode \"[[Mortal Coil (Star Trek: Voyager)|Mortal Coil]]\",  Seven of Nine told Neelix that the Kazon were \"unworthy\" of assimilation and would serve only to detract from the Borg's quest for perceived perfection.\n\n===Travel===\nThe Borg are a [[spacefaring]] race, and their primary interstellar transport is known as a \"'''Borg Cube'''\"<!-- bolded per [[WP:MOSBOLD]] as a redirect target --> due to its shape. A cube was first seen in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|Next Generation]]'' episode \"[[Q Who? (TNG episode)|Q Who?]]\" set in 2365. Common capabilities of cubes include high speed [[Warp drive|warp]] and [[Warp drive#transwarp|transwarp]] [[Spacecraft propulsion|drives]], self-regeneration and multiple-redundant systems, [[adaptation|adaptability]] in combat, and various [[directed-energy weapon|energy]] weapons as well as [[tractor beam]]s and cutting beams. Additionally, different types and size of Cubes have been observed as well as Borg Spheres and some smaller craft.<ref>http://www.startrek.com/database_article/borg-cube</ref>\n\nAs with most other ''Star Trek'' races, the Borg also have [[Transporter (Star Trek)|transporter]] capability.\n\n===Assimilation===\n'''Assimilation''' is the process by which the Borg integrate beings, cultures, and technology into the Collective. \"You will be assimilated\" is one of the few on-screen phrases employed by the Borg when communicating with other species. The Borg are portrayed as having found and assimilated thousands of species and billions to trillions of individual life-forms throughout the [[galaxy]]. The Borg designate each species with a number assigned to them upon [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]], humanity being 'Species 5618'.\n\nWhen first introduced, the Borg are said to be more interested in assimilating technology than people, roaming the universe as single-minded marauders that have assimilated starships, planets, and entire societies to collect new technology. They are discriminating in this area, finding certain races, for example the [[Kazon]], to be technologically inferior and unworthy of assimilation. A Borg infant found aboard a Borg Cube in \"Q Who?\" shows that the Borg will assimilate even children. The Borg then place the assimilated children into maturation chambers to quickly and fully grow them into mature drones.\n\n[[File:Picard as Locutus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Patrick Stewart]] as Locutus of Borg, the assimilated [[Jean-Luc Picard]]]]\nIn their second appearance, \"[[The Best of Both Worlds (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Best of Both Worlds]]\", they capture and assimilate Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] into the Collective, creating Locutus of Borg (meaning \"he who has spoken\", in Latin).\n\nThe method of assimilating individual life-forms into the Collective has been represented differently over time. When we see the Borg in ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'', assimilation is through abduction and then surgical procedure. In ''Star Trek: First Contact'' and ''Star Trek: Voyager'', assimilation is through injection of [[Nanorobotics|nanoprobes]] into an individual's [[Circulatory system|bloodstream]] via a pair of tubules that spring forth from a drone's hand. Assimilation by tubules is depicted on-screen as being a fast-acting process, with the victim's skin pigmentation turning gray and mottled with visible dark tracks forming within moments of contact. After assimilation, a drone's race and gender become \"irrelevant\". After initial assimilation through injection, Borg are surgically fitted with cybernetic devices. In ''Star Trek: First Contact'' an assimilated crew member is shown to have a forearm and an eye physically removed and replaced with cybernetic implants.\n\nThe Borg also assimilate, interface, and reconfigure technology using these tubules and nanoprobes. However, in ''Q Who?'' we see a Borg apparently trying to assimilate, probe, or reconfigure a control panel in engineering using an energy interface instead of nanoprobes.\n\nSome species, for various stated reasons, are able to resist assimilation by nanoprobes. [[Species 8472]] is the only race shown to be capable of completely rejecting assimilation attempts. Other species, such as the [[Hirogen]], have demonstrated resistance to assimilation as well as [[Phlox (Star Trek)|Dr Phlox]], who was able to partially resist the assimilation process in the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode \"[[Regeneration (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Regeneration]]\".<ref>''Star Trek: Voyager'', season 3 episode 26 and Season 4 Episode 1 (Scorpion Parts 1 & 2)</ref>\n\n==Concept==\nThe Borg represented a new antagonist and regular enemy that was lacking during the first season of ''TNG''; the [[Klingon]]s were allies and the [[Romulan]]s mostly absent. The [[Ferengi]] were originally intended as the new enemy for the United Federation of Planets, but their comical appearance and devotion to [[Capitalism|capitalist]] accumulation by [[free enterprise]] failed to portray them as a convincing threat. The Borg, however, with their frightening appearance, their immense power, and their sinister motive, became the signature villains for the ''TNG'' and ''Voyager'' eras of ''Star Trek''. In ''Voyager'' episode \"[[Q2 (Star Trek: Voyager)|Q2]]\", even Q tells his son, \"Don't provoke the Borg.\"\n\n''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' (''TNG'') writers began to develop the idea of the Borg as early as the Season 1 episode, \"[[Conspiracy (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Conspiracy]]\", which introduced a coercive, [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] life form that took over key Federation personnel. Plans to feature the Borg as an increasingly menacing threat were subsequently scrapped in favor of a more subtle introduction, beginning with the mystery of missing colonies on both sides of the Neutral Zone in \"[[The Neutral Zone (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Neutral Zone]]\" and culminating in the encounter between Borg and the ''Enterprise'' crew in \"[[Q Who?]]\".<ref>text commentary by Michael Okuda in the collector's edition of Star Trek: First Contact</ref>\n\n==Borg Queen==<!-- This section is linked from [[Data (Star Trek)]] -->\n[[File:Borg Queen 2372.jpg|thumb|[[Alice Krige]] as the Borg Queen in ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''.]]\nBefore the film ''Star Trek: First Contact'' (1996), the Borg exhibited no hierarchical command structure. ''First Contact'' introduced the Borg Queen, who is not named as such in the film (referring to herself with \"I am the Borg. I am the Collective.\") but is named Borg Queen in the closing credits. The Queen is played by [[Alice Krige]] in this film and in the 2001 finale of ''Star Trek: Voyager'', \"[[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|Endgame]]\". The character also appeared in Voyager's two-part episodes \"[[Dark Frontier (Star Trek: Voyager)|Dark Frontier]]\" (1999) and \"[[Unimatrix Zero (Star Trek: Voyager)|Unimatrix Zero]]\" (2000), but was portrayed by [[Susanna Thompson]].<ref>https://www.trektoday.com/news/150500_03.shtml</ref> Whether or not these appearances represent the same queen is never confirmed. The queen was killed in both ''First Contact'' and \"Dark Frontier\", so there may be a total of three queens throughout the series. In ''First Contact'', the Borg Queen is heard during a flashback of Picard's former assimilation, implying that she was present during the events of \"Best of Both Worlds\".\n\nThe Borg Queen is the focal point within the Borg collective consciousness and a unique drone within the Collective, who brings \"order to chaos\", referring to herself as \"we\" and \"I\" interchangeably. In ''First Contact'', the Queen's dialogue suggests she is an expression of the Borg Collective's overall intelligence, not a controller but the avatar of the entire Collective as an individual. This sentiment is contradicted by ''Star Trek: Voyager'', where she is seen explicitly directing, commanding, and in one instance even overriding the Collective. The introduction of the Queen radically changed the canonical understanding of the Borg function, with the authors of ''The Computers of Star Trek'' noting \"It was a lot easier for viewers to focus on a villain rather than a hive-mind that made decisions based on the input of all its members.\"<ref>Lois H. Gresh & Robert Weinberg, ''The Computers of Star Trek''. New York: Basic Books (1999): 147. \"It was a lot easier for viewers to focus on a villain rather than a hive-mind that made decisions based on the input of all its members.\"</ref>  ''First Contact'' writers [[Brannon Braga]] and [[Ronald D. Moore]] have defended the introduction of the Queen as a dramatic necessity, noting on the film's DVD audio commentary that they had initially written the film with drones, but then found that it was essential for the main characters to have someone to interact with beyond mindless drones. nigspic\n\n==Borg appearances==\nThe Borg were introduced on syndicated television on May 8, 1989, in the ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' episode \"Q Who?\", and rose to further prominence in the famous two part [[cliffhanger]] \"Best of Both Worlds, Part I\",<ref>[https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/star-trek-tng/32076/revisiting-star-trek-tng-best-of-both-worlds]</ref> which aired on June 18, 1990, with the sequel airing on September 24, 1990. In the ''Star Trek'' in-universe timeline, the earliest the Borg have been displayed is in 1996's ''Star Trek: First Contact''.\n\nOverall Borg aliens appear in a total of about 100 episodes of various incarnations of ''Star Trek''. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/star-trek-picard-essential-borg-episodes|title=The Best of Borg worlds: The 7 essential Borg episodes to watch before Star Trek: Picard|last=Britt|first=Ryan|date=2020-01-20|website=SYFY WIRE|language=en|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref> However, this is only by counting all the episodes which include the ex-borg character Seven of Nine.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Borg appear in just six episodes of ''Star Trek The Next Generation'' and 23 major appearances in ''Star Trek: Voyager''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===''The Next Generation''===\nThe Borg first appear in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' second-season episode \"[[Q Who?]]\", when the omnipotent life-form [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]] hurls the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|''Enterprise''-D]] across the galaxy to challenge [[Jean-Luc Picard]]'s assertion that his crew is ready to face the galaxy's dangers and mysteries. The ''Enterprise'' crew is overwhelmed by the Borg, and Picard begs for and receives Q's help in returning the ship to its previous coordinates.\n\nThe Borg next appear in ''The Next Generation''{{'}}s third-season finale and fourth-season premiere, \"[[The Best of Both Worlds (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Best of Both Worlds]]\". Picard is abducted and assimilated by the Borg and transformed into [[Jean-Luc Picard|Locutus]], the Latin for \"he who speaks\". Picard's knowledge of Starfleet's strengths and strategies is gained by the Collective, and the single cube destroys the entire Starfleet armada at [[Battle of Wolf 359|Wolf 359]]. The ''Enterprise'' crew manages to capture Locutus, gain information through him that allows them to destroy the cube, and then reverse the assimilation process.\n\nIn the fifth-season episode \"[[I, Borg]]\", the ''Enterprise'' crew rescues an adolescent Borg they name \"[[List of Star Trek characters (G\u2013M)#H|Hugh]]\". The crew faces the moral decision of whether or not to use Hugh (who begins to develop a sense of independence as a result of a severed link to the Collective) as a means of delivering a devastating computer virus to the Borg, or return to the Borg with his individuality intact.<ref name=\"TNGcompanion\">{{cite book|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2003|author=Nemeck, Larry|isbn=0-7434-5798-6}}</ref> They decide to return him without the virus, but in the sixth-season episode \"[[Descent (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Descent]]\", a group of rogue Borg who had \"assimilated\" individuality through Hugh fall under the control of the android [[Lore (Star Trek)|Lore]], the \"older brother\" of Data. Lore also corrupts Data through the use of an \"emotion chip\", simultaneously deactivating Data's ethical subroutines and only projecting negative emotions to it. Under this programming, Data participates in the capture of Picard, La Forge and Troi, but they are able to reactivate Data's ethical subroutines, allowing him to recognize that his current actions are wrong and leading to him deactivating Lore. Data recovers the emotion chip and the surviving Borg fall under the leadership of Hugh.\n\nIn 2017, SYFY listed \"I, Borg\" among the 25 best science fiction episodes of the last 25 years.<ref>[https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/the-25-greatest-stand-alone-episodes-of-sci-fi-tv-of-the-past-25-years]</ref>\n\n===''First Contact''===\nThe Borg return as the antagonists in the ''Next Generation'' film, ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''. After again failing to assimilate Earth by a direct assault in the year 2373, the Borg travel back in time to the year 2063 to try to stop [[Zefram Cochrane]]'s first contact with the [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcans]], change the timeline, and erase Starfleet from existence. The [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|''Enterprise''-E]] crew follows the Borg back in time and restores the original timeline. ''First Contact'' introduces the [[#Borg Queen|Borg Queen]] as played by  Alice Krige, who later reprised the role on United Paramount Network for the finale of ''Star Trek: Voyager''.\n\n===''Deep Space Nine''===\nThere is only one episode with Borg in ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' in the premiere episode ''[[Emissary (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Emissary]]''<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Benjamin Sisko]] ([[Avery Brooks]]) was an officer on the USS ''Saratoga'', one of the ships in the Starfleet armada dispatched to confront the Borg at Wolf 359. The ''Saratoga'' is destroyed by the Borg, killing Sisko's wife, Jennifer. During that episode, Sisko's meeting with Picard is tense as he blames Picard for the actions of Locutus. Throughout the remainder of the series, references to the Borg are made occasionally, including the design of their ship, [[USS Defiant|USS ''Defiant'']], and the battle from ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' being used as a plot point in Season 5 when Starfleet is spread too thin to deal with a Dominion incursion.\n\n===''Voyager''===\nThe Borg make frequent appearances in ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', which takes place in the Delta Quadrant. The Borg are first seen by ''Voyager'' in the third-season episode \"[[Unity (Star Trek: Voyager)|Unity]]\" in which [[Chakotay]] discovers the body of what the local humanoids refer to as \"the Invaders\"; which turns out to be the Borg. In \"[[Scorpion (Star Trek: Voyager)|Scorpion]]\", the Borg are engaged in a war of attrition against [[Species 8472]], whose biological defences are a match for the Borg's nanoprobes. In one of the few instances of the Borg negotiating, in exchange for safe passage through Borg space, the ''Voyager'' crew devises a way to destroy the otherwise invulnerable Species 8472. A Borg drone, [[Seven of Nine]], is dispatched to ''Voyager'' to facilitate this arrangement. After successfully driving Species 8472 back into their fluidic space, Seven of Nine is severed from the Collective and becomes a member of ''Voyager''{{'}}s crew. Seven of Nine's rediscovery of her individuality becomes a recurring theme throughout the series.\n\n''The Hollywood Reporter'' ranked \"Scorpion\" as the 4th best episode of ''Voyager'' in 2016,<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/star-trek-voyager-episodes-best-930900/item/worst-case-scenario-star-trek-925117 'Star Trek: Voyager' \u2014 The 15 Greatest Episodes].

The Borg play a peripheral role in \"[[Infinite Regress (Star Trek: Voyager)|Infinite Regress]]\", when Seven of Nine is exposed to a weapon against the Borg that essentially causes her to suffer from [[Dissociative identity disorder|MPD]], reverting to the personas of various people she assimilated while in the Collective. In \"[[Dark Frontier (Star Trek: Voyager)|Dark Frontier]]\", ''Voyager'' steals and uses a transwarp coil to both rescue Seven of Nine from the Borg Queen and then knock another fifteen years off their journey home before the coil burns out.\n\nIn the sixth season episode, \"[[Collective (Star Trek: Voyager)|Collective]]\", the crew of ''Voyager'' encounter a damaged cube that is holding Tom Paris, Neelix, Harry Kim and Chakotay hostage. With all the adult drones dead, the ship is run by five Borg children who are saved by ''Voyager'' and deassimilated. The later episode \"Child's Play\" reveals that the cube was infected by a pathogen that Icheb, one of the children, had been engineered to act as a host for by his parents, but the crew rescue Icheb before he can be sent back to the Borg. The crew encounter the Borg again in \"[[Unimatrix Zero]]\", a two-part cliffhanger between seasons six and seven.\n\nIn the seventh season we see the Borg in \"[[Q2 (Star Trek: Voyager)|Q2]]\", where Q's son brings Borg onto ''Voyager'', in \"[[Shattered (Star Trek: Voyager)|Shattered]]\", where the events depicted in \"Scorpion\" are revisited and in the series finale, \"[[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|Endgame]]\", in which [[Admiral Janeway]] from the future tries to bring ''Voyager'' back to Earth using a Borg transwarp hub. During this episode, Janeway infects the Borg with a [[Cordotomy|neurolytic]] pathogen that infects the collective and kills the Queen.\n\nThere are 26 major episodes featuring the Borg in Voyager, however there are about 100 if counting those with Seven of Nine.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===''Enterprise''===\nIn the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode \"[[Regeneration (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Regeneration]]\", the remnants of the destroyed sphere from ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' are discovered in the [[Arctic]] along with two frozen drones. The Borg steal a research ship and send a transmission toward the Delta Quadrant before they are destroyed, creating a perpetual time loop/predestination paradox.\n\n===''Discovery''===\nThough the Borg do not appear, in the ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' episode \"Perpetual Infinity\", Captain Leland of Section 31 is infected with nanites by the time-traveling rogue artificial intelligence known as Control. Leland displays characteristics similar to Borg drones, including black veins and a heightened ability to adapt in combat, leading some fans to speculate that Control is connected to the origin of the Borg or reverse engineered from recovered Borg tech. In addition, the Borg are known for their possession of [[Warp drive#Transwarp|transwarp]] technology, which allows them to travel to any section of the galaxy in an instant. Some fans suggest the technology may have been derived from ''Discovery''{{'}}s spore drive though there is no evidence to support this as of yet.\n\nThese theories are not confirmed as a Borg origin story in any episodes to date.<ref>https://screenrant.com/star-trek-discovery-control-borg-origin-theory/</ref><ref>https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/star-trek-discovery-the-borg-origin-story-retcon.html</ref>\n\n=== ''Picard'' ===\nThis series' first season includes four recovering ex-Borg characters: Picard, Seven of Nine, Hugh, (featured in \"I, Borg\" and \"Descent\")<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etonline.com/star-trek-picard-what-you-need-to-know-before-diving-into-the-cbs-all-access-series-140094|title='Star Trek: Picard': The Complete Guide to the CBS All Access Series|website=Entertainment Tonight|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> and Icheb.\n\n==Origin==\nThe origin of the Borg is never made clear, though they are portrayed as having existed for hundreds of thousands of years (as attested by [[Guinan (Star Trek)|Guinan]] and the Borg Queen). In ''Star Trek: First Contact'', the Borg Queen merely states that the Borg were once much like humanity, \"flawed and weak\", but gradually developed into a partially synthetic species in an ongoing attempt to evolve and perfect themselves.\n\nIn ''TNG''{{'}}s \"Q Who?\", Guinan mentions that the Borg are \"made up of organic and artificial life [...] which has been developing for [...] thousands of centuries.\" In the later episode of ''Star Trek: Voyager'', \"[[Dragon's Teeth (Star Trek: Voyager)|Dragon's Teeth]]\", Gedrin, of the race the Vaadwaur, says that before he and his people were put into suspended animation 892 years earlier (1482 A.D.), the Borg had assimilated only a few colonies in the Delta Quadrant and were considered essentially a minor nuisance. Now awake in the 24th century, he is amazed to see that the Borg control a vast area of the Delta Quadrant. [[Seven of Nine]] comments that the Borg's collective memories of that time period are fragmentary, though it is never established why that is.\n\n===Non-canon origin stories===\n''[[The Star Trek Encyclopedia]]'' speculates that a connection could exist between the Borg and ''[[V'ger]]'', the vessel encountered in ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''. This idea of a connection is advanced in [[William Shatner]]'s novel ''The Return''. The connection was also suggested in a letter included in ''[[Starlog]]'' no. 160 (November 1990). The letter writer, Christopher Haviland, also speculated that the original Borg drones were members of a race called \"the Preservers\", which [[Spock]] had suggested in the [[Star Trek Original Series|original series]] episode \"[[The Paradise Syndrome]]\" might be responsible for why so many humanoids populate the galaxy. It was confirmed in the ''TNG'' episode \"[[The Chase (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Chase]]\" that an ancient species seeded hundreds, if not thousands of planets with their DNA, creating the Humans, Vulcans, (and Romulans as they are a  Vulcan offshoot race) Cardassians and others.\n\nThe extra section of the game ''[[Star Trek: Legacy]]'' contains the supposed \"Origin of the Borg\", which tells the story of ''V'ger'' being sucked into a [[black hole]]. ''V'ger'' was found by a race of living machines that gave it a form suitable to fulfilling its simplistic programming. Unable to determine who its creator could be, the probe declared all [[carbon-based life]] an infestation of the creator's universe, leading to assimilation. From this, the Borg were created, as extensions of ''V'ger''{{'}}s purpose. Drones were made from those assimilated and merged into a collective [[consciousness]]. The Borg Queen was created out of the necessity for a single unifying voice. With thoughts and desires of her own, she was no longer bound to serve ''V'ger''.\n\nIn the graphic novel ''Star Trek: The Manga'', the Borg resulted from an experiment in medical nanotechnology gone wrong. An alien species under threat of extinction by an incurable disease created a repository [[satellite]] containing test subjects infused with body parts, organs, and [[DNA]] of multiple species along with cybernetic enhancements put in place by advanced medical technology. The satellite was maintained by nanomachines, which also maintained the medical equipment on board. The medical facility is parked in orbit by a black hole, and along with the [[Theory of Relativity|relativistic]] state of time around the black hole, allows long-term research to continue at an accelerated time scale rather than in real-time speed. As the medical facility deteriorates, so does the programming of the nanomachines. The nanomachines began infusing themselves into the patients, interpreting them as part of the satellite in need of repair. Among the patients is the daughter of the head medical researcher of the satellite. The satellite eventually falls apart in an encounter with an away team from the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]'' under the command of [[James T. Kirk]]. In the final moments of the satellite's destruction and the escape of the crew members of the ''Enterprise'' with the patients, the subjects display qualities inherently resembling the Borg: injection of nanomachines in a fashion similar to assimilation, rapid adaptation to weaponry, and a hive mind consciousness, as all the subjects begin following the whim of the daughter. As succumbing to the disease was inevitable, and the corrupt nanomachine programming infused itself into the bodies, the final image of the page of the [[manga]] Borg origin is left with the daughter turned Borg Queen, stating, \"Resistance is futile.\"\n\nIn the novel ''Lost Souls'' (the third book in the ''[[Star Trek: Destiny]]'' trilogy), the Borg are revealed to be the survivors of the Caeliar city Mantilis. Thrown across the galaxy in the [[Galactic quadrant#Delta Quadrant|Delta Quadrant]] and back in time to about 4500 BC by the destruction of Erigol at the climax of ''Gods of Night'', the first book in the trilogy, a group of human survivors from the starship ''Columbia'' [[Home (Star Trek: Enterprise)|(NX-02)]] and Caeliar scientists try to survive in a harsh arctic climate. Most of the human survivors die of exposure, while several Caeliar are absorbed into their race's gestalt to give life to the others in their group mind. The Caeliar offer the remaining humans a merging of human and Caeliar, to allow both groups to survive. The human survivors are resistant and as time goes on, the Caeliar called Sedin becomes the sole survivor of her group, her mental processes and her form both degrading as time goes on. When the humans return to Sedin for help, she forces them to merge with her, unwilling to allow herself to die when a union can save her life. The forced merging of the humans and the mostly decayed Caeliar results in the creation of the first Borg. The gestalt group mind is perverted to become the collective, driven by Sedin's desperate hunger and need to add the strength, technology, and life-force of others to her own. Ironically, while the Caeliar were\u2013albeit accidentally\u2013involved in the creation of the Borg, they also provide the means to end it; in the 24th century, the Caeliar absorb the entire Borg collective back into themselves, ending the cyborgs' centuries-long reign of terror.\n\n==Other non-canon media appearances==\nIn the ''Star Trek'' novel ''Probe'', which takes place following the events of ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'', the Borg are mentioned obliquely in communication with the whale-probe as spacefaring \"mites\" (the whale-probe's term for humanoid races) who traveled in cubical and spherical spacefaring vessels; the Borg apparently attacked the whale-probe and damaged its memory in some fashion before the events of the film.\n\nIn the ''Star Trek'' game ''[[Star Trek: Legacy]]'', the Borg are featured prominently throughout the ''Enterprise'' and ''TOS'' era's before becoming a major threat in the ''TNG'' era. In unlockable motion-comics that are unlocked after completing each era, it is revealed that the Vulcan T'Uerell experimented on Borg corpses left behind from the ''Enterprise'' episode \"Regeneration\", and became assimilated. It was not until the end of the ''TOS'' era that she made contact with the main Borg force and became a queen before she was finally killed in a fleet of Starfleet, Romulan, and Klingon ships led by Picard.\n\nThe [[Peter David]] novel ''Vendetta'' reveals that the planet killer weapon from the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Original Series]]'' episode \"[[The Doomsday Machine (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Doomsday Machine]]\" is a prototype for a weapon against the Borg. David revisited this concept in a 2007 sequel novel, ''Before Dishonor'', which features the ''Enterprise''-E working with Spock and Seven of Nine to reactivate the original planet killer to stop the Borg.\n\nIn [[William Shatner]]'s novel ''[[The Return (Shatner novel)|The Return]]'', [[Spock]] is nearly assimilated by the Borg, but is saved because he mind-melded with [[V'ger]], an earlier form of the Borg, and they assume that he is already a Borg. Using the information he subconsciously acquired in the meld, Spock is able to lead a crew of ''Enterprise'' officers (consisting of the ''Enterprise''-D crew, himself, Admiral McCoy, and the resurrected Kirk) in a ''Defiant''-class ship to destroy the Borg central node, severing all branches of the Collective from each other and limiting their future threat.\n\nIn David Mack's novel trilogy ''[[Star Trek: Destiny]]'', set over a year after ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'', the Borg stage a massive invasion of local space. Due to Kathryn Janeway crippling their infrastructure in \"[[Endgame (Star Trek)|Endgame]]\", the Borg fear for their survival and attempt to exterminate the Federation and its neighbors. They destroy the populations of numerous Federation worlds. The crews of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|''Enterprise''-E]], the ''[[Star Trek: Titan|Titan]]'', and the ''Aventine'' make contact with the Caeliar, the advanced species that created the Borg, and enlist their aid to end the Borg threat once and for all.\n\nIn the ''[[Doctor Who]]''/''Star Trek'' crossover comic, [[Star Trek: The Next Generation/Doctor Who: Assimilation2|''Assimilation2'']], the Borg join forces with the [[Cybermen]]. When the Cybermen subvert the Collective, the ''Enterprise''-D crew work with the [[Eleventh Doctor|Eleventh]] [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]] and the Borg, restoring the Borg to full strength and erasing the Borg/Cyberman alliance from existence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.whoviannet.co.uk/2012/02/doctor-who-star-trek-crossover-comic-revealed/|title=Doctor Who, Star Trek crossover comic revealed \u2022 Doctor Who News \u2022 WhovianNet|work=whoviannet.co.uk|access-date=March 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408180000/http://news.whoviannet.co.uk/2012/02/doctor-who-star-trek-crossover-comic-revealed/|archive-date=April 8, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nWriters [[Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens]] developed an unproduced idea for an episode that would have featured [[Alice Krige]] as a [[Starfleet]] medical technician who encounters the Borg and is assimilated \u2013 thereby becoming the Borg Queen.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://trekmovie.com/2007/09/22/interview-gar-judy-reeves-stevens-talk-mars-and-enterprise/ | title=Interview: Reeves-Stevenses Talk Mars and Enterprise | work=Trekmovie.com | date=September 22, 2007 | accessdate=21 August 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113121646/http://trekmovie.com/2007/09/22/interview-gar-judy-reeves-stevens-talk-mars-and-enterprise/ | archive-date=January 13, 2010 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn the video game ''[[Star Trek: Armada]]'', the Borg invades a [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]] cloning facility to create a clone of [[Jean-Luc Picard]] to create a new [[Locutus of Borg|Locutus]].\n\n===In video games===\nThe Borg appear as antagonists to the player in the following ''Star Trek'' video game titles:\n* ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation: Birth of the Federation]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: A Final Unity]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Armada]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Armada II]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Away Team]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Borg]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Voyager \u2013 Elite Force]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Elite Force II]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Starfleet Command III]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Encounters]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Invasion]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Legacy]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Conquest]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek Online]]''\n* ''Star Trek: Borg Contact''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Bridge Crew]]''\n\nIn March of 2001, Activision announced a game called ''[[Star Trek: Borg Assimilator]]'', in which the player would play a Borg.

The Borg are [[Cyborg|cybernetic organisms]], linked in a [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]] called \"the Collective\". The Borg co-opt the technology and knowledge of [[List of Star Trek races|other alien species]] to the Collective through the process of \"[[#Assimilation|assimilation]]\": forcibly transforming individual beings into \"drones\" by injecting [[nanomachine|nanoprobes]] into their bodies and surgically augmenting them with cybernetic components. The Borg's ultimate goal is \"achieving perfection\".<ref name=\"auto\">Star Trek: First Contact</ref><ref>https://screenrant.com/star-trek-borg-biggest-plot-holes-make-no-sense/</ref> Aside from being recurring antagonists in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|Next Generation]]'' television series, they are depicted as the main threat in the film ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''. In addition, they played major roles in the ''[[Star Trek: Voyager|Voyager]]'' series and serve as the way home to the [[Alpha Quadrant]] for the isolated Federation [[starship]] [[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|USS ''Voyager'']].\n\nThe Borg have become a symbol in [[popular culture]] for any [[juggernaut]] against which \"resistance is futile\".\n\n==Depiction==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=March 2020}}\nThe Borg are [[cyborgs]], having outward appearances showing both mechanical and biological body parts. Individual Borg are referred to as drones and move in a robotic, purposeful style ignoring most of their environment, including beings they do not consider an immediate threat. Borg commonly have one eye replaced with a sophisticated ocular implant. Borg usually have one arm replaced with a prosthesis, bearing one of a variety of multipurpose tools in place of a humanoid hand. Since different drones have different roles, the arm may be specialized for myriad purposes such as medical devices, scanners, and weapons. Borg have flat, white skin, giving them an almost [[zombie]]-like appearance.\n\nSome Borg have been shown to be far stronger than humans, able to easily overpower most humans and similar species. Typical Borg have never been seen to run, instead moving in a deliberate fashion, never retreating.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Borg are highly resistant to energy-based weapons, having personal shielding that quickly adapts to them. In various episodes, phasers and other [[directed energy weapon]]s tend to quickly become ineffective as the Borg are able to adapt to the specific frequencies on which these weapons are projected once a ship or an individual drone is struck down by them. Later attempts to [[modulation|modulate]] phaser and other weapon frequencies have had limited success. Borg shields have, however, proven to be ineffective protection against projectile or melee weapons, but this could prove problematic, given that in space travel, puncturing the hull with an errant shot could have catastrophic consequences.\n\nBorg possess a \"cortical node\" that controls other implanted cybernetic devices within a Borg's body; it is most often implanted in the forehead above the organic eye. If the cortical node fails, the Borg eventually dies. Successful replacement of the node can be carried out on a Borg vessel.\n\n===Borg Collective===\n[[File:Borg dockingstation.jpg|thumb|An occupied Borg \"alcove\" prop on display at the Hollywood Entertainment Museum]]\nBorg civilization is based on a hive or [[Group mind (science fiction)|group mind]] known as the Collective. Each Borg drone is linked to the collective by a sophisticated [[Subspace (Star Trek)#Subspace|subspace]] network that ensures each member is given constant supervision and guidance. The mental energy of the group consciousness can help an injured or damaged drone heal or regenerate damaged body parts or technology. The collective consciousness not only gives them the ability to \"share the same thoughts\", but also to adapt with great speed to tactics used against them.<ref>\"The Best of Both Worlds, Parts I and II\" (''Stara Trek: The Next Generation'')</ref> Drones in the Collective are never seen speaking, but a collective \"voice\" is sometimes transmitted to ships.\n\n===\"Resistance is futile\"===\nIndividual Borg rarely speak, though they do send a collective audio message to their targets, stating that \"resistance is futile\", generally followed by a declaration that the target in question will be [[#Assimilation|assimilated]] and its \"biological and technological distinctiveness\" will be added to their own. The exact phrasing varies and evolves over the various series episodes and film.\n\nThe complete phrase used in ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' is: {{cquote|We are the Borg. Lower your shields and surrender your ships. We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile.<ref>[http://www.moviesoundclips.net/sound.php?id=148 ''Star Trek - First Contact'' (1996)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929181255/http://www.moviesoundclips.net/sound.php?id=148 |date=September 29, 2013 }} Moviesoundclips.net. Rikeromega3 Productions 1999-2013. Retrieved September 26, 2013.</ref>}}\n\n===Nanoprobes===\nNanoprobes are [[Nanorobotics|microscopic machines]] that inhabit a Borg's body, bloodstream, and many cybernetic implants. The probes maintain the Borg cybernetic systems and repair damage to the organic parts of a Borg. They generate new technology inside a Borg when needed and protect them from many forms of disease. Borg nanoprobes, each about the size of a human [[red blood cell]], travel through the victim's bloodstream and attach to individual [[cell (biology)|cells]]. The nanoprobes rewrite the cellular [[DNA]], altering the victim's biochemistry, and eventually form larger, more complicated structures and networks within the body, like electrical pathways, processing and data-storage nodes, and ultimately prosthetic devices that spring forth from the skin. In \"[[Mortal Coil (Star Trek: Voyager)|Mortal Coil]]\", Seven of Nine states that the Borg assimilated the nanoprobe technology from \"Species 149\". In addition, the nanoprobes maintain and repair their host's mechanical and biological components on a microscopic level, imparting regenerative capabilities.\n\nThough used by the Borg to exert control over another being, reprogrammed nanoprobes were used by the crew of the starship ''Voyager'' in many instances as medical aids.\n\nThe capability of nanoprobes to absorb improved technologies they find into the Borg collective is shown in the ''Voyager'' episode \"[[Drone (Star Trek: Voyager)|Drone]]\", where [[Seven of Nine]]'s nanoprobes are fused with the Doctor's mobile emitter that uses technology from the 29th century, creating a 29th-century drone existing outside the Collective, with capabilities far surpassing that of the 24th-century drones.\n\nThe Borg do not try to immediately assimilate any being with which they come into contact; Borg drones tend to completely ignore individuals that are identified as too weak to be an imminent threat or too inferior to be worth assimilating. Captain Picard and his team walk safely past a group of Borg drones in a scene from the film ''Star Trek: First Contact'' while the drones fulfill a programmed mission. In the ''Star Trek: Voyager'' episode \"[[Mortal Coil (Star Trek: Voyager)|Mortal Coil]]\",  Seven of Nine told Neelix that the Kazon were \"unworthy\" of assimilation and would serve only to detract from the Borg's quest for perceived perfection.\n\n===Travel===\nThe Borg are a [[spacefaring]] race, and their primary interstellar transport is known as a \"'''Borg Cube'''\"<!-- bolded per [[WP:MOSBOLD]] as a redirect target --> due to its shape. A cube was first seen in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|Next Generation]]'' episode \"[[Q Who? (TNG episode)|Q Who?]]\" set in 2365. Common capabilities of cubes include high speed [[Warp drive|warp]] and [[Warp drive#transwarp|transwarp]] [[Spacecraft propulsion|drives]], self-regeneration and multiple-redundant systems, [[adaptation|adaptability]] in combat, and various [[directed-energy weapon|energy]] weapons as well as [[tractor beam]]s and cutting beams. Additionally, different types and size of Cubes have been observed as well as Borg Spheres and some smaller craft.<ref>http://www.startrek.com/database_article/borg-cube</ref>\n\nAs with most other ''Star Trek'' races, the Borg also have [[Transporter (Star Trek)|transporter]] capability.\n\n===Assimilation===\n'''Assimilation''' is the process by which the Borg integrate beings, cultures, and technology into the Collective. \"You will be assimilated\" is one of the few on-screen phrases employed by the Borg when communicating with other species. The Borg are portrayed as having found and assimilated thousands of species and billions to trillions of individual life-forms throughout the [[galaxy]]. The Borg designate each species with a number assigned to them upon [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]], humanity being 'Species 5618'.\n\nWhen first introduced, the Borg are said to be more interested in assimilating technology than people, roaming the universe as single-minded marauders that have assimilated starships, planets, and entire societies to collect new technology. They are discriminating in this area, finding certain races, for example the [[Kazon]], to be technologically inferior and unworthy of assimilation. A Borg infant found aboard a Borg Cube in \"Q Who?\" shows that the Borg will assimilate even children. The Borg then place the assimilated children into maturation chambers to quickly and fully grow them into mature drones.\n\n[[File:Picard as Locutus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Patrick Stewart]] as Locutus of Borg, the assimilated [[Jean-Luc Picard]]]]\nIn their second appearance, \"[[The Best of Both Worlds (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Best of Both Worlds]]\", they capture and assimilate Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] into the Collective, creating Locutus of Borg (meaning \"he who has spoken\", in Latin).\n\nThe method of assimilating individual life-forms into the Collective has been represented differently over time. When we see the Borg in ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'', assimilation is through abduction and then surgical procedure. In ''Star Trek: First Contact'' and ''Star Trek: Voyager'', assimilation is through injection of [[Nanorobotics|nanoprobes]] into an individual's [[Circulatory system|bloodstream]] via a pair of tubules that spring forth from a drone's hand. Assimilation by tubules is depicted on-screen as being a fast-acting process, with the victim's skin pigmentation turning gray and mottled with visible dark tracks forming within moments of contact. After assimilation, a drone's race and gender become \"irrelevant\". After initial assimilation through injection, Borg are surgically fitted with cybernetic devices. In ''Star Trek: First Contact'' an assimilated crew member is shown to have a forearm and an eye physically removed and replaced with cybernetic implants.\n\nThe Borg also assimilate, interface, and reconfigure technology using these tubules and nanoprobes. However, in ''Q Who?'' we see a Borg apparently trying to assimilate, probe, or reconfigure a control panel in engineering using an energy interface instead of nanoprobes.\n\nSome species, for various stated reasons, are able to resist assimilation by nanoprobes. [[Species 8472]] is the only race shown to be capable of completely rejecting assimilation attempts. Other species, such as the [[Hirogen]], have demonstrated resistance to assimilation as well as [[Phlox (Star Trek)|Dr Phlox]], who was able to partially resist the assimilation process in the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode \"[[Regeneration (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Regeneration]]\".<ref>''Star Trek: Voyager'', season 3 episode 26 and Season 4 Episode 1 (Scorpion Parts 1 & 2)</ref>\n\n==Concept==\nThe Borg represented a new antagonist and regular enemy that was lacking during the first season of ''TNG''; the [[Klingon]]s were allies and the [[Romulan]]s mostly absent. The [[Ferengi]] were originally intended as the new enemy for the United Federation of Planets, but their comical appearance and devotion to [[Capitalism|capitalist]] accumulation by [[free enterprise]] failed to portray them as a convincing threat. The Borg, however, with their frightening appearance, their immense power, and their sinister motive, became the signature villains for the ''TNG'' and ''Voyager'' eras of ''Star Trek''. In ''Voyager'' episode \"[[Q2 (Star Trek: Voyager)|Q2]]\", even Q tells his son, \"Don't provoke the Borg.\"\n\n''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' (''TNG'') writers began to develop the idea of the Borg as early as the Season 1 episode, \"[[Conspiracy (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Conspiracy]]\", which introduced a coercive, [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] life form that took over key Federation personnel. Plans to feature the Borg as an increasingly menacing threat were subsequently scrapped in favor of a more subtle introduction, beginning with the mystery of missing colonies on both sides of the Neutral Zone in \"[[The Neutral Zone (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Neutral Zone]]\" and culminating in the encounter between Borg and the ''Enterprise'' crew in \"[[Q Who?]]\".<ref>text commentary by Michael Okuda in the collector's edition of Star Trek: First Contact</ref>\n\n==Borg Queen==<!-- This section is linked from [[Data (Star Trek)]] -->\n[[File:Borg Queen 2372.jpg|thumb|[[Alice Krige]] as the Borg Queen in ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''.]]\nBefore the film ''Star Trek: First Contact'' (1996), the Borg exhibited no hierarchical command structure. ''First Contact'' introduced the Borg Queen, who is not named as such in the film (referring to herself with \"I am the Borg. I am the Collective.\") but is named Borg Queen in the closing credits. The Queen is played by [[Alice Krige]] in this film and in the 2001 finale of ''Star Trek: Voyager'', \"[[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|Endgame]]\". The character also appeared in Voyager's two-part episodes \"[[Dark Frontier (Star Trek: Voyager)|Dark Frontier]]\" (1999) and \"[[Unimatrix Zero (Star Trek: Voyager)|Unimatrix Zero]]\" (2000), but was portrayed by [[Susanna Thompson]].<ref>https://www.trektoday.com/news/150500_03.shtml</ref> Whether or not these appearances represent the same queen is never confirmed. The queen was killed in both ''First Contact'' and \"Dark Frontier\", so there may be a total of three queens throughout the series. In ''First Contact'', the Borg Queen is heard during a flashback of Picard's former assimilation, implying that she was present during the events of \"Best of Both Worlds\".\n\nThe Borg Queen is the focal point within the Borg collective consciousness and a unique drone within the Collective, who brings \"order to chaos\", referring to herself as \"we\" and \"I\" interchangeably. In ''First Contact'', the Queen's dialogue suggests she is an expression of the Borg Collective's overall intelligence, not a controller but the avatar of the entire Collective as an individual. This sentiment is contradicted by ''Star Trek: Voyager'', where she is seen explicitly directing, commanding, and in one instance even overriding the Collective. The introduction of the Queen radically changed the canonical understanding of the Borg function, with the authors of ''The Computers of Star Trek'' noting \"It was a lot easier for viewers to focus on a villain rather than a hive-mind that made decisions based on the input of all its members.\"<ref>Lois H. Gresh & Robert Weinberg, ''The Computers of Star Trek''. New York: Basic Books (1999): 147. \"It was a lot easier for viewers to focus on a villain rather than a hive-mind that made decisions based on the input of all its members.\"</ref>  ''First Contact'' writers [[Brannon Braga]] and [[Ronald D. Moore]] have defended the introduction of the Queen as a dramatic necessity, noting on the film's DVD audio commentary that they had initially written the film with drones, but then found that it was essential for the main characters to have someone to interact with beyond mindless drones.\n\n==Borg appearances==\nThe Borg were introduced on syndicated television on May 8, 1989, in the ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' episode \"Q Who?\", and rose to further prominence in the famous two part [[cliffhanger]] \"Best of Both Worlds, Part I\",<ref>[https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/star-trek-tng/32076/revisiting-star-trek-tng-best-of-both-worlds]</ref> which aired on June 18, 1990, with the sequel airing on September 24, 1990. In the ''Star Trek'' in-universe timeline, the earliest the Borg have been displayed is in 1996's ''Star Trek: First Contact''.\n\nOverall Borg aliens appear in a total of about 100 episodes of various incarnations of ''Star Trek''. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/star-trek-picard-essential-borg-episodes|title=The Best of Borg worlds: The 7 essential Borg episodes to watch before Star Trek: Picard|last=Britt|first=Ryan|date=2020-01-20|website=SYFY WIRE|language=en|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref> However, this is only by counting all the episodes which include the ex-borg character Seven of Nine.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Borg appear in just six episodes of ''Star Trek The Next Generation'' and 23 major appearances in ''Star Trek: Voyager''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===''The Next Generation''===\nThe Borg first appear in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' second-season episode \"[[Q Who?]]\", when the omnipotent life-form [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]] hurls the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|''Enterprise''-D]] across the galaxy to challenge [[Jean-Luc Picard]]'s assertion that his crew is ready to face the galaxy's dangers and mysteries. The ''Enterprise'' crew is overwhelmed by the Borg, and Picard begs for and receives Q's help in returning the ship to its previous coordinates.\n\nThe Borg next appear in ''The Next Generation''{{'}}s third-season finale and fourth-season premiere, \"[[The Best of Both Worlds (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Best of Both Worlds]]\". Picard is abducted and assimilated by the Borg and transformed into [[Jean-Luc Picard|Locutus]], the Latin for \"he who speaks\". Picard's knowledge of Starfleet's strengths and strategies is gained by the Collective, and the single cube destroys the entire Starfleet armada at [[Battle of Wolf 359|Wolf 359]]. The ''Enterprise'' crew manages to capture Locutus, gain information through him that allows them to destroy the cube, and then reverse the assimilation process.\n\nIn the fifth-season episode \"[[I, Borg]]\", the ''Enterprise'' crew rescues an adolescent Borg they name \"[[List of Star Trek characters (G\u2013M)#H|Hugh]]\". The crew faces the moral decision of whether or not to use Hugh (who begins to develop a sense of independence as a result of a severed link to the Collective) as a means of delivering a devastating computer virus to the Borg, or return to the Borg with his individuality intact.<ref name=\"TNGcompanion\">{{cite book|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2003|author=Nemeck, Larry|isbn=0-7434-5798-6}}</ref> They decide to return him without the virus, but in the sixth-season episode \"[[Descent (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Descent]]\", a group of rogue Borg who had \"assimilated\" individuality through Hugh fall under the control of the android [[Lore (Star Trek)|Lore]], the \"older brother\" of Data. Lore also corrupts Data through the use of an \"emotion chip\", simultaneously deactivating Data's ethical subroutines and only projecting negative emotions to it. Under this programming, Data participates in the capture of Picard, La Forge and Troi, but they are able to reactivate Data's ethical subroutines, allowing him to recognize that his current actions are wrong and leading to him deactivating Lore. Data recovers the emotion chip and the surviving Borg fall under the leadership of Hugh.\n\nIn 2017, SYFY listed \"I, Borg\" among the 25 best science fiction episodes of the last 25 years.<ref>[https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/the-25-greatest-stand-alone-episodes-of-sci-fi-tv-of-the-past-25-years]</ref>\n\n===''First Contact''===\nThe Borg return as the antagonists in the ''Next Generation'' film, ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''. After again failing to assimilate Earth by a direct assault in the year 2373, the Borg travel back in time to the year 2063 to try to stop [[Zefram Cochrane]]'s first contact with the [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcans]], change the timeline, and erase Starfleet from existence. The [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|''Enterprise''-E]] crew follows the Borg back in time and restores the original timeline. ''First Contact'' introduces the [[#Borg Queen|Borg Queen]] as played by  Alice Krige, who later reprised the role on United Paramount Network for the finale of ''Star Trek: Voyager''.\n\n===''Deep Space Nine''===\nThere is only one episode with Borg in ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' in the premiere episode ''[[Emissary (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Emissary]]''<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Benjamin Sisko]] ([[Avery Brooks]]) was an officer on the USS ''Saratoga'', one of the ships in the Starfleet armada dispatched to confront the Borg at Wolf 359. The ''Saratoga'' is destroyed by the Borg, killing Sisko's wife, Jennifer. During that episode, Sisko's meeting with Picard is tense as he blames Picard for the actions of Locutus. Throughout the remainder of the series, references to the Borg are made occasionally, including the design of their ship, [[USS Defiant|USS ''Defiant'']], and the battle from ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' being used as a plot point in Season 5 when Starfleet is spread too thin to deal with a Dominion incursion.\n\n===''Voyager''===\nThe Borg make frequent appearances in ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', which takes place in the Delta Quadrant. The Borg are first seen by ''Voyager'' in the third-season episode \"[[Unity (Star Trek: Voyager)|Unity]]\" in which [[Chakotay]] discovers the body of what the local humanoids refer to as \"the Invaders\"; which turns out to be the Borg. In \"[[Scorpion (Star Trek: Voyager)|Scorpion]]\", the Borg are engaged in a war of attrition against [[Species 8472]], whose biological defences are a match for the Borg's nanoprobes. In one of the few instances of the Borg negotiating, in exchange for safe passage through Borg space, the ''Voyager'' crew devises a way to destroy the otherwise invulnerable Species 8472. A Borg drone, [[Seven of Nine]], is dispatched to ''Voyager'' to facilitate this arrangement. After successfully driving Species 8472 back into their fluidic space, Seven of Nine is severed from the Collective and becomes a member of ''Voyager''{{'}}s crew. Seven of Nine's rediscovery of her individuality becomes a recurring theme throughout the series.\n\n''The Hollywood Reporter'' ranked \"Scorpion\" as the 4th best episode of ''Voyager'' in 2016,<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/star-trek-voyager-episodes-best-930900/item/worst-case-scenario-star-trek-925117 'Star Trek: Voyager' \u2014 The 15 Greatest Episodes].

The Borg play a peripheral role in \"[[Infinite Regress (Star Trek: Voyager)|Infinite Regress]]\", when Seven of Nine is exposed to a weapon against the Borg that essentially causes her to suffer from [[Dissociative identity disorder|MPD]], reverting to the personas of various people she assimilated while in the Collective. In \"[[Dark Frontier (Star Trek: Voyager)|Dark Frontier]]\", ''Voyager'' steals and uses a transwarp coil to both rescue Seven of Nine from the Borg Queen and then knock another fifteen years off their journey home before the coil burns out.\n\nIn the sixth season episode, \"[[Collective (Star Trek: Voyager)|Collective]]\", the crew of ''Voyager'' encounter a damaged cube that is holding Tom Paris, Neelix, Harry Kim and Chakotay hostage. With all the adult drones dead, the ship is run by five Borg children who are saved by ''Voyager'' and deassimilated. The later episode \"Child's Play\" reveals that the cube was infected by a pathogen that Icheb, one of the children, had been engineered to act as a host for by his parents, but the crew rescue Icheb before he can be sent back to the Borg. The crew encounter the Borg again in \"[[Unimatrix Zero]]\", a two-part cliffhanger between seasons six and seven.\n\nIn the seventh season we see the Borg in \"[[Q2 (Star Trek: Voyager)|Q2]]\", where Q's son brings Borg onto ''Voyager'', in \"[[Shattered (Star Trek: Voyager)|Shattered]]\", where the events depicted in \"Scorpion\" are revisited and in the series finale, \"[[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|Endgame]]\", in which [[Admiral Janeway]] from the future tries to bring ''Voyager'' back to Earth using a Borg transwarp hub. During this episode, Janeway infects the Borg with a [[Cordotomy|neurolytic]] pathogen that infects the collective and kills the Queen.\n\nThere are 26 major episodes featuring the Borg in Voyager, however there are about 100 if counting those with Seven of Nine.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===''Enterprise''===\nIn the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode \"[[Regeneration (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Regeneration]]\", the remnants of the destroyed sphere from ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' are discovered in the [[Arctic]] along with two frozen drones. The Borg steal a research ship and send a transmission toward the Delta Quadrant before they are destroyed, creating a perpetual time loop/predestination paradox.\n\n===''Discovery''===\nThough the Borg do not appear, in the ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' episode \"Perpetual Infinity\", Captain Leland of Section 31 is infected with nanites by the time-traveling rogue artificial intelligence known as Control. Leland displays characteristics similar to Borg drones, including black veins and a heightened ability to adapt in combat, leading some fans to speculate that Control is connected to the origin of the Borg or reverse engineered from recovered Borg tech. In addition, the Borg are known for their possession of [[Warp drive#Transwarp|transwarp]] technology, which allows them to travel to any section of the galaxy in an instant. Some fans suggest the technology may have been derived from ''Discovery''{{'}}s spore drive though there is no evidence to support this as of yet.\n\nThese theories are not confirmed as a Borg origin story in any episodes to date.<ref>https://screenrant.com/star-trek-discovery-control-borg-origin-theory/</ref><ref>https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/star-trek-discovery-the-borg-origin-story-retcon.html</ref>\n\n=== ''Picard'' ===\nThis series' first season includes four recovering ex-Borg characters: Picard, Seven of Nine, Hugh, (featured in \"I, Borg\" and \"Descent\")<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etonline.com/star-trek-picard-what-you-need-to-know-before-diving-into-the-cbs-all-access-series-140094|title='Star Trek: Picard': The Complete Guide to the CBS All Access Series|website=Entertainment Tonight|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> and Icheb.\n\n==Origin==\nThe origin of the Borg is never made clear, though they are portrayed as having existed for hundreds of thousands of years (as attested by [[Guinan (Star Trek)|Guinan]] and the Borg Queen). In ''Star Trek: First Contact'', the Borg Queen merely states that the Borg were once much like humanity, \"flawed and weak\", but gradually developed into a partially synthetic species in an ongoing attempt to evolve and perfect themselves.\n\nIn ''TNG''{{'}}s \"Q Who?\", Guinan mentions that the Borg are \"made up of organic and artificial life [...] which has been developing for [...] thousands of centuries.\" In the later episode of ''Star Trek: Voyager'', \"[[Dragon's Teeth (Star Trek: Voyager)|Dragon's Teeth]]\", Gedrin, of the race the Vaadwaur, says that before he and his people were put into suspended animation 892 years earlier (1482 A.D.), the Borg had assimilated only a few colonies in the Delta Quadrant and were considered essentially a minor nuisance. Now awake in the 24th century, he is amazed to see that the Borg control a vast area of the Delta Quadrant. [[Seven of Nine]] comments that the Borg's collective memories of that time period are fragmentary, though it is never established why that is.\n\n===Non-canon origin stories===\n''[[The Star Trek Encyclopedia]]'' speculates that a connection could exist between the Borg and ''[[V'ger]]'', the vessel encountered in ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''. This idea of a connection is advanced in [[William Shatner]]'s novel ''The Return''. The connection was also suggested in a letter included in ''[[Starlog]]'' no. 160 (November 1990). The letter writer, Christopher Haviland, also speculated that the original Borg drones were members of a race called \"the Preservers\", which [[Spock]] had suggested in the [[Star Trek Original Series|original series]] episode \"[[The Paradise Syndrome]]\" might be responsible for why so many humanoids populate the galaxy. It was confirmed in the ''TNG'' episode \"[[The Chase (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Chase]]\" that an ancient species seeded hundreds, if not thousands of planets with their DNA, creating the Humans, Vulcans, (and Romulans as they are a  Vulcan offshoot race) Cardassians and others.\n\nThe extra section of the game ''[[Star Trek: Legacy]]'' contains the supposed \"Origin of the Borg\", which tells the story of ''V'ger'' being sucked into a [[black hole]]. ''V'ger'' was found by a race of living machines that gave it a form suitable to fulfilling its simplistic programming. Unable to determine who its creator could be, the probe declared all [[carbon-based life]] an infestation of the creator's universe, leading to assimilation. From this, the Borg were created, as extensions of ''V'ger''{{'}}s purpose. Drones were made from those assimilated and merged into a collective [[consciousness]]. The Borg Queen was created out of the necessity for a single unifying voice. With thoughts and desires of her own, she was no longer bound to serve ''V'ger''.\n\nIn the graphic novel ''Star Trek: The Manga'', the Borg resulted from an experiment in medical nanotechnology gone wrong. An alien species under threat of extinction by an incurable disease created a repository [[satellite]] containing test subjects infused with body parts, organs, and [[DNA]] of multiple species along with cybernetic enhancements put in place by advanced medical technology. The satellite was maintained by nanomachines, which also maintained the medical equipment on board. The medical facility is parked in orbit by a black hole, and along with the [[Theory of Relativity|relativistic]] state of time around the black hole, allows long-term research to continue at an accelerated time scale rather than in real-time speed. As the medical facility deteriorates, so does the programming of the nanomachines. The nanomachines began infusing themselves into the patients, interpreting them as part of the satellite in need of repair. Among the patients is the daughter of the head medical researcher of the satellite. The satellite eventually falls apart in an encounter with an away team from the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]'' under the command of [[James T. Kirk]]. In the final moments of the satellite's destruction and the escape of the crew members of the ''Enterprise'' with the patients, the subjects display qualities inherently resembling the Borg: injection of nanomachines in a fashion similar to assimilation, rapid adaptation to weaponry, and a hive mind consciousness, as all the subjects begin following the whim of the daughter. As succumbing to the disease was inevitable, and the corrupt nanomachine programming infused itself into the bodies, the final image of the page of the [[manga]] Borg origin is left with the daughter turned Borg Queen, stating, \"Resistance is futile.\"\n\nIn the novel ''Lost Souls'' (the third book in the ''[[Star Trek: Destiny]]'' trilogy), the Borg are revealed to be the survivors of the Caeliar city Mantilis. Thrown across the galaxy in the [[Galactic quadrant#Delta Quadrant|Delta Quadrant]] and back in time to about 4500 BC by the destruction of Erigol at the climax of ''Gods of Night'', the first book in the trilogy, a group of human survivors from the starship ''Columbia'' [[Home (Star Trek: Enterprise)|(NX-02)]] and Caeliar scientists try to survive in a harsh arctic climate. Most of the human survivors die of exposure, while several Caeliar are absorbed into their race's gestalt to give life to the others in their group mind. The Caeliar offer the remaining humans a merging of human and Caeliar, to allow both groups to survive. The human survivors are resistant and as time goes on, the Caeliar called Sedin becomes the sole survivor of her group, her mental processes and her form both degrading as time goes on. When the humans return to Sedin for help, she forces them to merge with her, unwilling to allow herself to die when a union can save her life. The forced merging of the humans and the mostly decayed Caeliar results in the creation of the first Borg. The gestalt group mind is perverted to become the collective, driven by Sedin's desperate hunger and need to add the strength, technology, and life-force of others to her own. Ironically, while the Caeliar were\u2013albeit accidentally\u2013involved in the creation of the Borg, they also provide the means to end it; in the 24th century, the Caeliar absorb the entire Borg collective back into themselves, ending the cyborgs' centuries-long reign of terror.\n\n==Other non-canon media appearances==\nIn the ''Star Trek'' novel ''Probe'', which takes place following the events of ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'', the Borg are mentioned obliquely in communication with the whale-probe as spacefaring \"mites\" (the whale-probe's term for humanoid races) who traveled in cubical and spherical spacefaring vessels; the Borg apparently attacked the whale-probe and damaged its memory in some fashion before the events of the film.\n\nIn the ''Star Trek'' game ''[[Star Trek: Legacy]]'', the Borg are featured prominently throughout the ''Enterprise'' and ''TOS'' era's before becoming a major threat in the ''TNG'' era. In unlockable motion-comics that are unlocked after completing each era, it is revealed that the Vulcan T'Uerell experimented on Borg corpses left behind from the ''Enterprise'' episode \"Regeneration\", and became assimilated. It was not until the end of the ''TOS'' era that she made contact with the main Borg force and became a queen before she was finally killed in a fleet of Starfleet, Romulan, and Klingon ships led by Picard.\n\nThe [[Peter David]] novel ''Vendetta'' reveals that the planet killer weapon from the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Original Series]]'' episode \"[[The Doomsday Machine (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Doomsday Machine]]\" is a prototype for a weapon against the Borg. David revisited this concept in a 2007 sequel novel, ''Before Dishonor'', which features the ''Enterprise''-E working with Spock and Seven of Nine to reactivate the original planet killer to stop the Borg.\n\nIn [[William Shatner]]'s novel ''[[The Return (Shatner novel)|The Return]]'', [[Spock]] is nearly assimilated by the Borg, but is saved because he mind-melded with [[V'ger]], an earlier form of the Borg, and they assume that he is already a Borg. Using the information he subconsciously acquired in the meld, Spock is able to lead a crew of ''Enterprise'' officers (consisting of the ''Enterprise''-D crew, himself, Admiral McCoy, and the resurrected Kirk) in a ''Defiant''-class ship to destroy the Borg central node, severing all branches of the Collective from each other and limiting their future threat.\n\nIn David Mack's novel trilogy ''[[Star Trek: Destiny]]'', set over a year after ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'', the Borg stage a massive invasion of local space. Due to Kathryn Janeway crippling their infrastructure in \"[[Endgame (Star Trek)|Endgame]]\", the Borg fear for their survival and attempt to exterminate the Federation and its neighbors. They destroy the populations of numerous Federation worlds. The crews of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|''Enterprise''-E]], the ''[[Star Trek: Titan|Titan]]'', and the ''Aventine'' make contact with the Caeliar, the advanced species that created the Borg, and enlist their aid to end the Borg threat once and for all.\n\nIn the ''[[Doctor Who]]''/''Star Trek'' crossover comic, [[Star Trek: The Next Generation/Doctor Who: Assimilation2|''Assimilation2'']], the Borg join forces with the [[Cybermen]]. When the Cybermen subvert the Collective, the ''Enterprise''-D crew work with the [[Eleventh Doctor|Eleventh]] [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]] and the Borg, restoring the Borg to full strength and erasing the Borg/Cyberman alliance from existence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.whoviannet.co.uk/2012/02/doctor-who-star-trek-crossover-comic-revealed/|title=Doctor Who, Star Trek crossover comic revealed \u2022 Doctor Who News \u2022 WhovianNet|work=whoviannet.co.uk|access-date=March 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408180000/http://news.whoviannet.co.uk/2012/02/doctor-who-star-trek-crossover-comic-revealed/|archive-date=April 8, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nWriters [[Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens]] developed an unproduced idea for an episode that would have featured [[Alice Krige]] as a [[Starfleet]] medical technician who encounters the Borg and is assimilated \u2013 thereby becoming the Borg Queen.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://trekmovie.com/2007/09/22/interview-gar-judy-reeves-stevens-talk-mars-and-enterprise/ | title=Interview: Reeves-Stevenses Talk Mars and Enterprise | work=Trekmovie.com | date=September 22, 2007 | accessdate=21 August 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113121646/http://trekmovie.com/2007/09/22/interview-gar-judy-reeves-stevens-talk-mars-and-enterprise/ | archive-date=January 13, 2010 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn the video game ''[[Star Trek: Armada]]'', the Borg invades a [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]] cloning facility to create a clone of [[Jean-Luc Picard]] to create a new [[Locutus of Borg|Locutus]].\n\n===In video games===\nThe Borg appear as antagonists to the player in the following ''Star Trek'' video game titles:\n* ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation: Birth of the Federation]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: A Final Unity]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Armada]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Armada II]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Away Team]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Borg]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Voyager \u2013 Elite Force]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Elite Force II]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Starfleet Command III]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Encounters]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Invasion]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Legacy]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Conquest]]''\n* ''[[Star Trek Online]]''\n* ''Star Trek: Borg Contact''\n* ''[[Star Trek: Bridge Crew]]''\n\nIn March of 2001, Activision announced a game called ''[[Star Trek: Borg Assimilator]]'', in which the player would play a Borg.

[[Petrol engine|Gas engine]]s can use [[gasoline direct injection]], where the fuel is directly delivered into the [[combustion chamber]], or [[indirect injection]] where the fuel is mixed with air before the [[intake stroke]].\n\nOn petrol engines, fuel injection replaced [[carburetor]]s from the 1980s onward.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Welshans |first1=Terry |title=A Brief History of Aircraft Carburetors and Fuel Systems |url=http://www.enginehistory.org/Accessories/HxFuelSys/FuelSysHx01.shtml |website=enginehistory.org |publisher=Aircraft Engine Historical Society |location=US |accessdate=2016-06-28 |date=August 2013}}</ref> The primary difference between carburetion and fuel injection is that fuel injection [[atomizer nozzle|atomizes]] the fuel through a small nozzle under high pressure, while a carburetor relies on [[suction]] created by intake air accelerated through a [[Venturi tube]] to draw the fuel into the airstream.\n\n==Objectives==\nThe functional objectives for fuel injection systems can vary. All share the central task of supplying fuel to the combustion process, but it is a design decision how a particular system is optimized. There are several competing objectives such as:\n*Power output\n*[[Fuel efficiency]]\n*Emissions performance\n*Running on [[alternative fuel]]s\n*Reliability\n*Driveability and smooth operation\n*Initial cost\n*Maintenance cost\n*Diagnostic capability\n*Range of environmental operation\n*[[Engine tuning]]\n\nModern [[digital data|digital]] electronic fuel injection systems optimize these competing objectives more effectively and consistently than earlier fuel delivery systems (such as carburetors). Carburetors have the potential to atomize fuel better (see Pogue and Allen Caggiano patents).{{dubious|date=April 2012}}\n\n==Benefits==\nBenefits of fuel injection include smoother and more consistent transient throttle response, such as during quick [[throttle]] transitions, easier cold starting, more accurate adjustment to account for extremes of ambient temperatures and changes in air pressure, more stable idling, decreased maintenance needs, and better fuel efficiency.\n\nFuel injection also dispenses with the need for a separate mechanical [[choke valve|choke]], which on carburetor-equipped vehicles must be adjusted as the engine warms up to normal temperature. Furthermore, on spark ignition engines, [[gasoline direct injection|(direct) fuel injection]] has the advantage of being able to facilitate [[stratified charge engine|stratified combustion]] which has not been possible with carburetors.\n\nIt is only with the advent of multi-point fuel injection certain engine configurations such as inline five-cylinder gasoline engines have become more feasible for mass production, as traditional carburetor arrangements with single or twin carburetors can not provide even fuel distribution between cylinders, unless a more complicated individual carburetor per cylinder is used.\n\nFuel injection systems are also able to operate normally regardless of orientation, whereas carburetors with floats are not able to operate upside down or in microgravity, such as that encountered on airplanes.\n\n===Environmental benefits===\nFuel injection generally increases engine fuel efficiency. With the improved cylinder-to-cylinder fuel distribution of multi-point fuel injection, less fuel is needed for the same power output (when cylinder-to-cylinder distribution varies significantly, some cylinders receive excess fuel as a side effect of ensuring that all cylinders receive ''sufficient'' fuel).\n\nExhaust [[vehicle emissions control|emissions]] are cleaner because the more precise and accurate fuel metering reduces the concentration of toxic combustion byproducts leaving the engine. The more consistent and predictable composition of the exhaust makes emissions control devices such as [[catalytic converter]]s more effective and easier to design.\n\n==History and development==\n[[Herbert Akroyd Stuart]] developed the first device with a design similar to modern fuel injection <ref>{{Cite book|title=A Biographical Dictionary of People in Engineering: From Earliest Records to 2000|last=Hall|first=Carl W.|publisher=Purdue University Press|year=2008|isbn=|edition=1st|location=|pages=|via=Credo Reference}}</ref>, using a 'jerk pump' to meter out [[fuel oil]] at high pressure to an injector.

German direct injection petrol engines used injection systems developed by [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] from their diesel injection systems. Later versions of the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] and [[Wright R-3350]] used single point fuel injection, at the time called \"Pressure Carburettor\". Due to the wartime relationship between Germany and Japan, Mitsubishi also had two radial aircraft engines using fuel injection, the [[Mitsubishi Kinsei]] (''kinsei'' means \"venus\") and the [[Mitsubishi Kasei]] (''kasei'' means \"mars\").\n\nAlfa Romeo tested one of the first '''electronic''' injection systems ([[Caproni]]-Fuscaldo) in [[Alfa Romeo 6C]] 2500 with \"Ala spessa\" body in 1940 [[Mille Miglia]].

The Hesselman engine was a low compression design constructed to run on heavy fuel oils.\n\nDirect gasoline injection was applied during the [[World War II|Second World War]] to almost all higher-output production aircraft powerplants made in Germany (the widely used [[BMW 801]] radial, and the popular inverted inline V12 [[Daimler-Benz DB 601]], [[DB 603]], and [[DB 605]], along with the similar [[Junkers Jumo 210]]G, [[Jumo 211]], and [[Jumo 213]], starting as early as 1937 for both the Jumo 210G and DB 601), the Soviet Union ([[Shvetsov ASh-82]]FN radial, 1943, Chemical Automatics Design Bureau - [[Chemical Automatics Design Bureau|KB Khimavtomatika]]) and the USA ([[Wright R-3350]] ''Duplex Cyclone'' radial, 1944).\n\nImmediately following the war, [[hot rod]]der [[Stuart Hilborn]] started to offer mechanical injection for race cars, [[salt cars]], and [[midget car racing|midget racer]]s,<ref>''Circle Track'', 9/84, pp.82-3.</ref> well-known and easily distinguishable because of their prominent [[velocity stack]]s projecting upwards from the engines on which they were used.\n\nThe first automotive direct injection system used to run on gasoline was developed by [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]], and was introduced by [[Goliath (car)|Goliath]] for their [[Goliath GP700]] automobile, and [[Gutbrod]] in 1952. This was basically a specially lubricated high-pressure diesel direct-injection pump of the type that is governed by the vacuum behind an intake throttle valve. (Modern diesels only change the amount of fuel injected to vary output; there is no throttle.) This system used a normal gasoline fuel pump, to provide fuel to a mechanically driven injection pump, which had separate plungers per injector to deliver a very high injection pressure directly into the combustion chamber. The 1954 [[Mercedes-Benz W196]] [[Formula 1]] racing car engine used [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] direct injection derived from wartime aircraft engines. Following this racetrack success, the 1955 [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]], the first production sports car to use fuel injection, used direct injection. The 1955 [[Mercedes-Benz 300SLR]], in which [[Stirling Moss]] drove to victory in the 1955 [[Mille Miglia]] and [[Pierre Levegh]] crashed and died in the [[1955 Le Mans disaster]], had an engine developed from the W196 engine. The Bosch fuel injectors were placed into the bores on the cylinder wall used by the spark plugs in other Mercedes-Benz six-cylinder engines (the spark plugs were relocated to the cylinder head). Later, more mainstream applications of fuel injection favored the less-expensive indirect injection methods.\n\n[[File:1959 Chevrolet Corvette C1 V8 283 cui Fuel Injection.jpg|thumb|right|A 1959 [[Chevrolet Corvette (C1)|Corvette]] small-block 4.6 litre V8 with Rochester mechanical fuel injection]]\n[[Chevrolet]] introduced a mechanical fuel injection option, made by [[General Motors]]' [[Rochester Products Division]], for its [[Chevrolet small-block engine|283 V8 engine]] in 1956 (1957 U.S. [[model year]]). This system directed the inducted engine air across a \"spoon shaped\" plunger that moved in proportion to the air volume. The plunger connected to the fuel metering system that mechanically dispensed fuel to the cylinders via distribution tubes. This system was not a \"pulse\" or intermittent injection, but rather a constant flow system, metering fuel to all cylinders simultaneously from a central \"spider\" of injection lines. The fuel meter adjusted the amount of flow according to engine speed and load, and included a fuel reservoir, which was similar to a carburetor's float chamber. With its own high-pressure fuel pump driven by a cable from the distributor to the fuel meter, the system supplied the necessary pressure for injection. This was a \"port\" injection where the injectors are located in the intake manifold, very near the intake valve.\n\nIn 1956, [[Lucas Industries|Lucas]] developed its injection system, which was first used for [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] racing cars at [[Le Mans]]. The system was subsequently adopted very successfully in [[Formula One]] racing, securing championships by [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]], [[British Racing Motors|BRM]], [[Team Lotus|Lotus]], [[Brabham]], [[Equipe Matra Sports|Matra]], and [[Tyrrell Racing|Tyrrell]] in the years 1959 through 1973.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.lucasinjection.com/HISTORY.htm |title=A short history of Lucas injection |publisher=lucasinjection.com |accessdate=2015-05-01}}</ref> While the racing systems used a simple ''fuel cam'' for metering, a more sophisticated ''Mk 2'' vacuum based ''shuttle metering'' was developed for production cars.

Constant-flow injection systems continue to be used at the highest levels of drag racing, where full-throttle, high-RPM performance is key.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://www.hotrod.com/techarticles/engine/hrdp_1010_what_you_need_to_know_about_mechanical_fuel_injection/index.html |first=Marlan |last=Davis |title=What You Need To Know About Mechanical Fuel Injection |journal=Hot Rod Magazine |date=October 2010 |accessdate=2015-05-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, one of the first Japanese designed cars to use mechanical fuel injection was the [[Daihatsu Compagno]].\n\nAnother mechanical system, made by [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] called [[Jetronic]], but injecting the fuel into the port above the intake valve, was used by several European car makers, particularly Porsche from 1969 until 1973 in the 911 production range and until 1975 on the Carrera 3.0 in Europe. Porsche continued using this system on its racing cars into the late seventies and early eighties. Porsche racing variants such as the 911 RSR 2.7 & 3.0, 904/6, 906, 907, 908, 910, 917 (in its regular normally aspirated or 5.5 Liter/1500&nbsp;HP turbocharged form), and 935 all used Bosch or [[Kugelfischer]] built variants of injection. The early Bosch Jetronic systems were also used by Audi, Volvo, BMW, Volkswagen, and many others. The Kugelfischer system was also used by the BMW 2000/2002 Tii and some versions of the Peugeot 404/504 and Lancia Flavia.\n\nA system similar to the Bosch inline mechanical pump was built by [[SPICA]] for Alfa Romeo, used on the [[Alfa Romeo Montreal]] and on U.S. market 1750 and 2000 models from 1969 to 1981. This was designed to meet the U.S. emission requirements with no loss in performance and it also reduced fuel consumption.\n\n===={{anchor|EFI|electronic}}Electronic injection====\nBecause mechanical injection systems have limited adjustments to develop the optimal amount of fuel into an engine that needs to operate under a variety of different conditions (such as when starting, the engine's speed and load, atmospheric and engine temperatures, altitude, ignition timing, etc.) electronic fuel injection (EFI) systems were developed that relied on numerous sensors and controls. When working together, these electronic components can sense variations and the main system computes the appropriate amount of fuel needed to achieve better engine performance based on a stored \"map\" of optimal settings for given requirements.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Hqsyv_KD0lgC&pg=PA113&dq=Electronic+vs+mechanical+fuel+injection |page=133 |title=Air pollution from motor vehicles; standards and technologies for controlling emissions |first=Asif |last=Faiz |first2=Christopher S. |last2=Weaver |first3=Michael P. |last3=Walsh |first4=Surhid P. |last4=Gautam |publisher=The World Bank |year=1996 |isbn=9780821334447 |access-date=2017-08-26}}</ref>  in 1953, the [[Bendix Corporation]] began exploring the idea of an electronic fuel injection system as a way eliminate the well known problems of traditional carburetors.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Rambler Rebel\u2019s fuel injection \u2013 The Dream and the Legend |url= https://www.hemmings.com/blog/2017/06/25/the-rambler-rebels-fuel-injection-the-dream-and-the-legend/ |publisher=Hemmings |accessdate=2018-11-08 |date=2017-06-27}}</ref>\n\nThe first commercial EFI system was the \"Electrojector\" developed by Bendix and was offered by [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]] (AMC) in 1957.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60C16FD355A137A93C6AB1788D85F438585F9 |last=Ingraham |first=Joseph C. |title=Automobiles: Races; Everybody Manages to Win Something At the Daytona Beach Contests |newspaper=The New York Times |date=1957-03-24 |page=153 |accessdate=2015-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal=Consumer Reports |year=1957 |volume=22 |title=1957 cars |page=154}}</ref> The [[Rambler Rebel]], showcased AMC's new [[AMC V8 engine#327|{{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine]].<ref>{{cite web |title=1957 Rambler Rebel promotional flyers |url=http://www3.ohio.net/~dsiringer/omcover/1950/1957%20Rebel%20Flyer.JPG |website=ohio.net |accessdate=2018-11-08}}</ref> The Electrojector was an option and rated at {{convert|288|bhp|kW|1|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book |last=Holder |first=William |last2=Kunz |first2=Phil |title=Extreme Muscle Cars: The Factory Lightweight Legacy |publisher=Krause Publications |year=2006 |page=16 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Pn8cAHTaaKQC&pg=PA16 |isbn=978-0-89689-278-1 |accessdate=2015-05-01}}</ref> The EFI produced peak [[torque]] 500 [[revolutions per minute|rpm]] lower than the equivalent [[carburetor]]ed engine<ref name=\"howgood\"/> The Rebel Owners Manual described the design and operation of the new system.<ref name=\"excerpts\">{{cite web |title=An Invitation to Happy Motoring...

Most of the 35 vehicles originally so equipped were field-retrofitted with 4-barrel carburetors. The Electrojector patents were subsequently sold to Bosch.\n\nBosch developed an electronic fuel injection system, called ''[[Jetronic#D-Jetronic (1967\u20131976)|D-Jetronic]]'' (''D'' for ''Druck'', German for \"pressure\"), which was first used on the [[Volkswagen Type 3|VW 1600TL/E]] in 1967. This was a speed/density system, using engine speed and intake manifold air density to calculate \"air mass\" flow rate and thus fuel requirements. This system was adopted by [[Volkswagen|VW]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Porsche]], [[Citro\u00ebn]], [[Saab Automobile|Saab]], and [[Volvo Cars|Volvo]]. Lucas licensed the system for production in [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] cars, initially in D-Jetronic form before switching to L-Jetronic in 1978 on the [[Jaguar XK6 engine|XK6 engine]].\n\nBosch superseded the D-Jetronic system with the ''[[Jetronic#K-Jetronic (1974\u20131988)|K-Jetronic]]'' and ''[[L-Jetronic]]'' systems for 1974, though some cars (such as the [[Volvo 164]]) continued using D-Jetronic for the following several years. In 1970, the [[Isuzu 117 Coup\u00e9]] was introduced with a Bosch-supplied D-Jetronic fuel injected engine sold only in Japan. In 1984 Rover fitted [[Lucas Industries|Lucas]] electronic fuel injection, which was based on some L-Jetronic patents, to the [[BL S-Series engine|S-Series engine]] as used in the [[Rover 200 / 25#Rover 200 .28SD3.3B 1984.E2.80.931989.29|200 model]].\n\n[[File:1976 Cosworth Vega engine (Bendix Electronic Fuel Injection).jpg|thumb|Chevrolet Cosworth Vega engine showing Bendix electronic fuel injection (in orange).]]\n\nIn Japan, the [[Toyota Celica]] used electronic, multi-port fuel injection in the optional [[Toyota R engine#18R-E|18R-E]] engine in January 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://members.iinet.net.au/~stepho/manuals/Celica/JapSpecsCelica1.tiff |title=Celica Parts Catalogue |publisher=Toyota |language=Japanese |accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref> Nissan offered electronic, multi-port fuel injection in 1975 with the Bosch L-Jetronic system used in the [[Nissan L engine#L28E|Nissan L28E engine]] and installed in the [[Nissan Fairlady Z]], [[Nissan Cedric]], and the [[Nissan Gloria]]. Nissan also installed multi-point fuel injection in the [[Nissan Y engine|Nissan Y44 V8 engine]] in the [[Nissan President]]. Toyota soon followed with the same technology in 1978 on the [[Toyota M engine#4M|4M-E]] engine installed in the [[Toyota Crown]], the [[Toyota Supra]], and the [[Toyota Mark II]]. In the 1980s, the [[Isuzu Piazza]] and the [[Mitsubishi Starion]] added fuel injection as standard equipment, developed separately with both companies history of diesel powered engines. 1981 saw Mazda offer fuel injection in the [[Mazda Luce]] with the [[Mazda F engine#FE|Mazda FE engine]] and, in 1983, Subaru offered fuel injection in the [[Subaru EA-81|Subaru EA81]] engine installed in the [[Subaru Leone]]. Honda followed in 1984 with their own system, called PGM-FI in the [[Honda Accord]], and the [[Honda Vigor]] using the [[Honda E engine#ES|Honda ES3 engine]].\n\nThe limited production [[Chevrolet Cosworth Vega]] was introduced in March 1975 using a Bendix EFI system with pulse-time manifold injection, four injector valves, an electronic control unit (ECU), five independent sensors, and two fuel pumps. The EFI system was developed to satisfy stringent emission control requirements and market demands for a technologically advanced responsive vehicle. 5000 hand-built Cosworth Vega engines were produced but only 3,508 cars were sold through 1976.<ref>1975 Chevrolet Cosworth Vega Overhaul Supplement - general information</ref>\n\nThe [[Cadillac Seville]] was introduced in 1975 with an EFI system made by Bendix and modelled very closely on Bosch's D-Jetronic. L-Jetronic first appeared on the 1974 Porsche 914, and uses a mechanical airflow meter (L for '''''Luft''''', German for \"air\") that produces a signal that is proportional to \"air volume\". This approach required additional sensors to measure the [[atmospheric pressure]] and temperature, to ultimately calculate \"air mass\". L-Jetronic was widely adopted on European cars of that period, and a few Japanese models a short time later.\n\nIn 1980, [[Motorola]] (now [[NXP Semiconductors]]) introduced the first electronic [[engine control unit]], the [[Ford EEC#EEC-III|EEC-III]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.motorola.com/staticfiles/Consumers/Corporate/US-EN/_Documents/Motorola_History_Timeline.pdf |title=A Timeline Overview of Motorola History 1928-2009 |publisher=Motorola |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110620224820/http://www.motorola.com/staticfiles/Consumers/Corporate/US-EN/_Documents/Motorola_History_Timeline.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-20 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref> Its integrated control of engine functions (such as fuel injection and spark timing) is now the standard approach for fuel injection systems. The Motorola technology was installed in [[Ford EEC|Ford]] North American products.\n<!-- In 1981 Chrysler Corporation introduced an EFI system featuring a sensor that directly measures the air mass flow into the engine, on the Imperial automobile (5.2&nbsp;L V8) as standard equipment. The mass air sensor utilizes a heated platinum wire placed in the incoming air flow. The rate of the wire's cooling is proportional to the air mass flowing across the wire. Since the hot wire sensor directly measures air mass, the need for additional temperature and pressure sensors was eliminated. This system was independently developed and engineered in Highland Park, Michigan and manufactured at Chrysler's Electronics division in Huntsville, Alabama.<ref>{{cite web |first=Matthew |last=Litwin |url=http://www.hemmings.com/hcc/stories/2008/07/01/hmn_feature22.html |title=1981-1983 Chrysler Imperial |publisher=Hemmings.com |date=2008-07 |accessdate=2012-02-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imperialclub.com/Yr/1981/81EFI/Cover.htm |title=1981-1983 Imperial EFI Troubleshooting Guide |publisher=Imperialclub.com |date=2007-08-04 |accessdate=2012-02-09}}</ref> *** need proof it was the first car to use MAF for this to be significant -->\n\n==Elimination of carburetors==\nIn the 1970s and 1980s in the U.S. and Japan, the respective federal governments imposed increasingly strict [[automobile emissions control|exhaust emission]] regulations. During that time period, the vast majority of gasoline-fueled automobile and light truck engines did not use fuel injection. To comply with the new regulations, automobile manufacturers often made extensive and complex modifications to the engine carburetor(s). While a simple carburetor system is cheaper to manufacture than a fuel injection system, the more complex carburetor systems installed on many engines in the 1970s were much more costly than the earlier simple carburetors. To more easily comply with emissions regulations, automobile manufacturers began installing fuel injection systems in more gasoline engines during the late 1970s.\n\n[[Open-loop controller|Open-loop]] fuel injection systems had already improved cylinder-to-cylinder fuel distribution and engine operation over a wide temperature range, but did not offer further scope to sufficiently control fuel/air mixtures, in order to further reduce exhaust emissions. Later [[feedback controller|closed-loop]] fuel injection systems improved the air\u2013fuel mixture control with an [[exhaust gas]] [[oxygen sensor]]. Although not part of the injection control, a [[catalytic converter]] further reduces exhaust emissions.\n\nFuel injection was phased in through the latter 1970s and 80s at an accelerating rate, with the German, French, and U.S. markets leading and the UK and Commonwealth markets lagging somewhat. Since the early 1990s, almost all gasoline passenger cars sold in [[first world]] markets are equipped with electronic fuel injection (EFI). In Brazil, carburetors were entirely replaced by fuel injection during the 1990s, with the first EFI equipped model built in 1989 (the [[Volkswagen Gol]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/noticias/grandes-brasileiros-volkswagen-gol-gti-30-anos/|title=Grandes Brasileiros: Volkswagen Gol GTi completa 30 anos|website=Quatro Rodas|language=pt-BR|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref> The carburetor remains in use in developing countries where vehicle emissions are unregulated and diagnostic and repair infrastructure is sparse. Fuel injection is gradually replacing carburetors in these nations too as they adopt emission regulations conceptually similar to those in force in Europe, Japan, Australia, and North America.\n\nMany motorcycles still use carburetored engines, though all current high-performance designs have switched to EFI.\n\n[[NASCAR]] finally replaced carburetors with fuel-injection, starting at the beginning of the [[2012 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]] season.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/nascar/2011-02-11-nascar-fuel-injection_N.htm |title=NASCAR sets fuel injection for '12 but keeping restrictor plates |first=Nate |last=Ryan |date=2011-11-02 |newspaper=USA Today |accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoserviceworld.com/news/nascar-moves-to-fuel-injection-bosch-first-approved-supplier/1000522267/ |title=NASCAR Moves to Fuel Injection, Bosch First Approved Supplier |publisher=Auto Service World |date=2011-07-18 |accessdate=2014-01-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201224457/http://www.autoserviceworld.com/news/nascar-moves-to-fuel-injection-bosch-first-approved-supplier/1000522267/ |archivedate=2014-02-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nascar.com/news/111020/bosch-sensors-fuel-injection/index.html |title=Bosch to provide oxygen sensors for fuel injection |publisher=NASCAR.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225011421/http://www.nascar.com/news/111020/bosch-sensors-fuel-injection/index.html |archivedate=2011-12-25 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref>\n\n==System components==\n\n===System overview===\nThe process of determining the necessary amount of fuel, and its delivery into the engine, are known as fuel metering. Early injection systems used mechanical methods to meter fuel, while nearly all modern systems use electronic metering.\n\n===Determining how much fuel to supply===\n<!-- this might be better as a diagram/schematic -->\nThe primary factor used in determining the amount of fuel required by the engine is the amount (by weight) of air that is being taken in by the engine for use in combustion. Modern systems use a mass airflow sensor to send this information to the [[engine control unit]].\n\nData representing the amount of power output desired by the driver (sometimes known as \"engine load\") is also used by the [[engine control unit]] in calculating the amount of fuel required. A throttle position sensor (TPS) provides this information. Other engine sensors used in EFI systems include a coolant temperature sensor, a camshaft or crankshaft position sensor (some systems get the position information from the distributor), and an oxygen sensor which is installed in the exhaust system so that it can be used to determine how well the fuel has been combusted, therefore allowing [[Feedback controller|closed loop]] operation.\n\n===Supplying the fuel to the engine===\nFuel is transported from the fuel tank (via fuel lines) and pressurised using fuel pump(s). Maintaining the correct fuel pressure is done by a fuel pressure regulator. Often a [[fuel rail]] is used to divide the fuel supply into the required number of cylinders. The fuel injector injects liquid fuel into the intake air (the location of the fuel injector varies between systems).\n\nUnlike carburetor-based systems, where the [[float chamber]] provides a reservoir, fuel injected systems depend on an uninterrupted flow of fuel. To avoid [[fuel starvation]] when subject to lateral [[G-forces]], vehicles are often provided with an [[anti-surge]] vessel, usually integrated in the [[fuel tank]], but sometimes as a separate, small anti-surge tank.\n\n===EFI gasoline engine components===\n<blockquote>\n''These examples specifically apply to a modern EFI gasoline engine. Parallels to fuels other than gasoline can be made, but only conceptually.''\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Injector3.gif|thumb|right|350px|Animated cut through diagram of a typical fuel injector.

The ECU interprets data from input sensors to, among other tasks, calculate the appropriate amount of fuel to inject.\n\n===Fuel injector===\nWhen signaled by the [[engine control unit]] the fuel injector opens and sprays the pressurised fuel into the engine. The duration that the injector is open (called the [[pulse-width modulation|pulse width]]) is proportional to the amount of fuel delivered. Depending on the system design, the timing of when injector opens is either relative each individual cylinder (for a sequential fuel injection (SFI) system), or injectors for multiple cylinders may be signalled to open at the same time (in a batch fire system).\n\n==Target air\u2013fuel ratios==\nThe relative proportions of air and fuel vary according to the type of fuel used and the performance requirements (i.e. power, fuel economy, or exhaust emissions).\n\nSee [[Air\u2013fuel ratio]], [[Stoichiometry]], and [[Combustion]].\n\n==Various injection schemes==\n{{More footnotes|date=May 2010}}\n\n==={{Anchor|TBI|EGI|CFI|SPI|Throttle body injection}}Single-point injection===\nSingle-point injection (SPI) uses a single injector at the [[throttle body]] (the same location as was used by carburetors).\n\nIt was introduced in the 1940s in large aircraft engines (then called the [[pressure carburetor]]) and in the 1980s in the automotive world (called Throttle-body Injection by [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], Central Fuel Injection by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], PGM-CARB by Honda, and EGI by [[Mazda]]). Since the fuel passes through the intake runners (like a carburetor system), it is called a \"wet manifold system\".\n\nThe justification for single-point injection was low cost. Many of the carburetor's supporting components - such as the air cleaner, intake manifold, and fuel line routing - could be reused. This postponed the redesign and tooling costs of these components. Single-point injection was used extensively on American-made passenger cars and light trucks during 1980\u20131995, and in some European cars in the early and mid-1990s.\n\n===Continuous injection===\nIn a continuous injection system, fuel flows at all times from the fuel injectors, but at a variable flow rate. This is in contrast to most fuel injection systems, which provide fuel during short pulses of varying duration, with a constant rate of flow during each pulse. Continuous injection systems can be multi-point or single-point, but not direct.\n\nThe most common automotive continuous injection system is Bosch's [[Jetronic#K|K-Jetronic]], introduced in 1974. K-Jetronic was used for many years between 1974 and the mid-1990s by [[BMW]], [[Lamborghini]], [[Ferrari]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Volkswagen]], [[Ford]], [[Porsche]], [[Audi]], [[Saab Automobile|Saab]], [[DeLorean Motor Company|DeLorean]], and [[Volvo]]. Chrysler used a continuous fuel injection system on the 1981-1983 [[Imperial (automobile)#1981\u20131983|Imperial]].\n\nIn piston aircraft engines, continuous-flow fuel injection is the most common type. In contrast to automotive fuel injection systems, aircraft continuous flow fuel injection is all [[mechanical fuel injection|mechanical]], requiring no electricity to operate. Two common types exist: the Bendix RSA system, and the [[Teledyne Continental Motors|TCM]] system. The Bendix system is a direct descendant of the [[pressure carburetor]]. However, instead of having a discharge valve in the barrel, it uses a ''flow divider'' mounted on top of the engine, which controls the discharge rate and evenly distributes the fuel to stainless steel injection lines to the intake ports of each cylinder. The TCM system is even more simple. It has no venturi, no pressure chambers, no diaphragms, and no discharge valve. The control unit is fed by a constant-pressure fuel pump. The control unit simply uses a butterfly valve for the air, which is linked by a mechanical linkage to a rotary valve for the fuel. Inside the control unit is another restriction, which controls the fuel mixture. The pressure drop across the restrictions in the control unit controls the amount of fuel flow, so that fuel flow is directly proportional to the pressure at the flow divider. In fact, most aircraft that use the TCM fuel injection system feature a fuel flow gauge that is actually a pressure gauge calibrated in ''gallons per hour'' or ''pounds per hour'' of fuel.\n\n===Central port injection===\nFrom 1992 to 1996 [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] implemented a system called Central Port Injection or Central Port Fuel Injection. The system uses tubes with poppet valves from a central injector to spray fuel at each intake port rather than the central throttle-body{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}. Fuel pressure is similar to a single-point injection system. CPFI (used from 1992 to 1995) is a [[#Fuel injector|batch-fire]] system, while CSFI (from 1996) is a sequential system.<ref>1997 Chevrolet Truck Service Manual, page 6A-24, drawing, item (3) Central Sequential Muliport injector.</ref>\n\n===Multipoint fuel injection{{Anchor|Multiport fuel injection|MPI|MPFI}}===<!-- old section name to keep old links working -->\nMultipoint fuel injection (MPI), also called port fuel injection (PFI), injects fuel into the intake ports just upstream of each cylinder's intake valve, rather than at a central point within an intake manifold. MPI systems can be ''sequential'', in which injection is timed to coincide with each cylinder's intake stroke; ''batched'', in which fuel is injected to the cylinders in groups, without precise synchronization to any particular cylinder's intake stroke; or ''simultaneous'', in which fuel is injected at the same time to all the cylinders. The intake is only slightly wet, and typical fuel pressure runs between 40-60 psi.\n\nMany modern EFI systems use sequential MPI; however, in newer gasoline engines, direct injection systems are beginning to replace sequential ones.\n\n===Direct injection===\n{{See also|Common rail}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2010}}\n\nIn a direct injection engine, fuel is injected into the combustion chamber as opposed to injection before the [[intake valve]] (petrol engine) or a separate pre-combustion chamber (diesel engine).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.unep.org/transport/gfei/autotool/approaches/technology/ic_engines.asp |title=IC Engines |work=Global Fuel Economy Initiative |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121006095155/http://www.unep.org/transport/gfei/autotool/approaches/technology/ic_engines.asp#gasoline |archivedate=2012-10-06 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref>\n\nIn a [[common rail]] system, the fuel from the fuel tank is supplied to the common header (called the accumulator). This fuel is then sent through tubing to the injectors, which inject it into the combustion chamber. The header has a high pressure relief valve to maintain the pressure in the header and return the excess fuel to the fuel tank. The fuel is sprayed with the help of a nozzle that is opened and closed with a needle valve, operated with a solenoid. When the solenoid is not activated, the spring forces the needle valve into the nozzle passage and prevents the injection of fuel into the cylinder. The solenoid lifts the needle valve from the valve seat, and fuel under pressure is sent in the engine cylinder. Third-generation common rail diesels use [[piezoelectric]] injectors for increased precision, with fuel pressures up to {{convert|1800|bar|psi|abbr=on|lk=on|disp=or}}.\n\nDirect fuel injection costs more than indirect injection systems: the injectors are exposed to more heat and pressure, so more costly materials and higher-precision electronic management systems are required.\n\n====Diesel engines====\nAll diesel engines have fuel injected into the combustion chamber.\n\nEarlier systems, relying on simpler injectors, often injected into a sub-chamber shaped to swirl the compressed air and improve combustion; this was known as [[indirect injection]]. However, this was less efficient than the now common direct injection in which initiation of combustion takes place in a depression (often [[toroid (geometry)|toroidal]]) in the crown of the piston.\n\nThroughout the early history of diesels, they were always fed by a mechanical pump with a small separate chamber for each cylinder, feeding separate fuel lines and individual injectors.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Most such pumps were in-line, though some were rotary.\n\nMost modern diesel engines use [[common rail]] or [[unit injector]] direct injection systems. A special type of direct injection system is the [[M-System]], that was used throughout the second half of the 20th century.\n\n====Gasoline engines{{anchor|Petrol/gasoline engines}}====\n{{Main article|Gasoline direct injection}}\n\nModern [[petrol engine|gasoline engine]]s also use direct injection, which is referred to as [[gasoline direct injection]]. This is the next step in evolution from multi-point fuel injection, and offers another magnitude of emission control by eliminating the \"wet\" portion of the induction system along the inlet tract.\n\nBy virtue of better [[dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]] and [[homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneity]] of the directly injected fuel, the cylinder and piston are cooled, thereby permitting higher [[compression ratio]]s and earlier [[ignition timing]], with resultant enhanced [[power (physics)|power]] output. More precise management of the fuel injection event also enables better control of emissions. Finally, the homogeneity of the fuel mixture allows for leaner air\u2013fuel ratios, which together with more precise ignition timing can improve [[fuel efficiency]]. Along with this, the engine can operate with stratified ([[lean-burn]]) mixtures, and hence avoid throttling losses at low and part engine load. Some direct-injection systems incorporate [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectronic]] fuel injectors. With their extremely fast response time, multiple injection events can occur during each cycle of each cylinder of the engine.\n\n===Swirl injection===\nSwirl injectors are used in liquid rocket, gas turbine, and diesel engines to improve atomization and mixing efficiency.\n\nThe circumferential velocity component is first generated as the propellant enters through helical or tangential inlets producing a thin, swirling liquid sheet. A gas-filled hollow core is then formed along the centerline inside the injector due to centrifugal force of the liquid sheet. Because of the presence of the gas core, the discharge coefficient is generally low. In swirl injector, the spray cone angle is controlled by the ratio of the circumferential velocity to the axial velocity and is generally wide compared with nonswirl injectors.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Comparative Study of Spray Characteristics of Gas-Centered and Liquid-Centered Swirl Coaxial Injectors |last=Ji-Hyuk |first=Im |last2=Seongho |first2=Cho |last3=Youngbin |first3=Yoon |last4=Insang |first4=Moon |journal=Journal of Propulsion and Power |year=2010}}</ref>\n\n==Maintenance hazards==\nFuel injection introduces potential hazards in engine maintenance due to the high fuel pressures used. Residual pressure can remain in the fuel lines long after an injection-equipped engine has been shut down. This residual pressure must be relieved, and if it is done so by external bleed-off, the fuel must be safely contained. If a high-pressure diesel fuel injector is removed from its seat and operated in open air, there is a risk to the operator of injury by [[Jet injector#Accidental jet injection|hypodermic jet-injection]], even with only {{convert|100|psi|bar|abbr=on}} pressure.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Agha |first=F.P. |title=High-pressure paint gun injuries of hand: clinical and roentgen aspects |journal=NY State Journal of Medicine |volume=78 |issue= |pages=1955\u20136 |year=1978}}</ref> The first known such injury occurred in 1937 during a diesel engine maintenance operation.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rees |first=C.E. |title=Penetration of Tissue by Fuel Oil Under High Pressure from a Diesel Engine |journal=Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=109 |issue=11 |pages=866\u20137 |year=1937 |doi=10.1001/jama.1937.92780370004012c |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n;Patents\n*{{US patent|3430616}} \u2014 ''Fuel Injection Control System'' \u2014 Otto Gl\u00f6ckler, et al.\n*{{US patent|3500801}} \u2014 ''Actuator Circuit for Electronic Precision Fuel Metering Systems'' \u2014 E.

[[Petrol engine]]s can use [[gasoline direct injection]], where the fuel is directly delivered into the [[combustion chamber]], or [[indirect injection]] where the fuel is mixed with air before the [[intake stroke]].\n\nOn petrol engines, fuel injection replaced [[carburetor]]s from the 1980s onward.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Welshans |first1=Terry |title=A Brief History of Aircraft Carburetors and Fuel Systems |url=http://www.enginehistory.org/Accessories/HxFuelSys/FuelSysHx01.shtml |website=enginehistory.org |publisher=Aircraft Engine Historical Society |location=US |accessdate=2016-06-28 |date=August 2013}}</ref> The primary difference between carburetion and fuel injection is that fuel injection [[atomizer nozzle|atomizes]] the fuel through a small nozzle under high pressure, while a carburetor relies on [[suction]] created by intake air accelerated through a [[Venturi tube]] to draw the fuel into the airstream.\n\n==Objectives==\nThe functional objectives for fuel injection systems can vary. All share the central task of supplying fuel to the combustion process, but it is a design decision how a particular system is optimized. There are several competing objectives such as:\n*Power output\n*[[Fuel efficiency]]\n*Emissions performance\n*Running on [[alternative fuel]]s\n*Reliability\n*Driveability and smooth operation\n*Initial cost\n*Maintenance cost\n*Diagnostic capability\n*Range of environmental operation\n*[[Engine tuning]]\n\nModern [[digital data|digital]] electronic fuel injection systems optimize these competing objectives more effectively and consistently than earlier fuel delivery systems (such as carburetors). Carburetors have the potential to atomize fuel better (see Pogue and Allen Caggiano patents).{{dubious|date=April 2012}}\n\n==Benefits==\nBenefits of fuel injection include smoother and more consistent transient throttle response, such as during quick [[throttle]] transitions, easier cold starting, more accurate adjustment to account for extremes of ambient temperatures and changes in air pressure, more stable idling, decreased maintenance needs, and better fuel efficiency.\n\nFuel injection also dispenses with the need for a separate mechanical [[choke valve|choke]], which on carburetor-equipped vehicles must be adjusted as the engine warms up to normal temperature. Furthermore, on spark ignition engines, [[gasoline direct injection|(direct) fuel injection]] has the advantage of being able to facilitate [[stratified charge engine|stratified combustion]] which has not been possible with carburetors.\n\nIt is only with the advent of multi-point fuel injection certain engine configurations such as inline five-cylinder gasoline engines have become more feasible for mass production, as traditional carburetor arrangements with single or twin carburetors can not provide even fuel distribution between cylinders, unless a more complicated individual carburetor per cylinder is used.\n\nFuel injection systems are also able to operate normally regardless of orientation, whereas carburetors with floats are not able to operate upside down or in microgravity, such as that encountered on airplanes.\n\n===Environmental benefits===\nFuel injection generally increases engine fuel efficiency. With the improved cylinder-to-cylinder fuel distribution of multi-point fuel injection, less fuel is needed for the same power output (when cylinder-to-cylinder distribution varies significantly, some cylinders receive excess fuel as a side effect of ensuring that all cylinders receive ''sufficient'' fuel).\n\nExhaust [[vehicle emissions control|emissions]] are cleaner because the more precise and accurate fuel metering reduces the concentration of toxic combustion byproducts leaving the engine. The more consistent and predictable composition of the exhaust makes emissions control devices such as [[catalytic converter]]s more effective and easier to design.\n\n==History and development==\n[[Herbert Akroyd Stuart]] developed the first device with a design similar to modern fuel injection <ref>{{Cite book|title=A Biographical Dictionary of People in Engineering: From Earliest Records to 2000|last=Hall|first=Carl W.|publisher=Purdue University Press|year=2008|isbn=|edition=1st|location=|pages=|via=Credo Reference}}</ref>, using a 'jerk pump' to meter out [[fuel oil]] at high pressure to an injector.

Fuel injection was in widespread commercial use in [[diesel engine]]s by the mid-1920s.\n\nAn early use of indirect gasoline injection dates back to 1902, when French aviation engineer [[Leon Levavasseur]] installed it on his pioneering [[Antoinette 8V]] aircraft powerplant, the first [[V8 engine]] of any type ever produced in any quantity.<ref name=\"Hartmann\">{{cite web |url= http://www.hydroretro.net/etudegh/antoinette.pdf |title=Les moteurs et a\u00e9roplanes Antoinette |first=Gerard |last=Hartmann |date=2007-08-05 |language=French |trans-title= Antoinette engines and aeroplanes |format=PDF |publisher=hydroretro.net |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141214235209/http://www.hydroretro.net/etudegh/antoinette.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-14 |accessdate=2015-05-01}}</ref>\n\nAnother early use of [[gasoline direct injection]] was on the [[Hesselman engine]] invented by Swedish [[engineer]] [[Jonas Hesselman]] in 1925.<ref>{{cite book |title=Scania fordonshistoria 1891-1991 |first=Bj\u00f6rn-Eric |last=Lindh |year=1992 |publisher=Streiffert |language=Swedish |isbn=978-91-7886-074-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Volvo \u2013 Lastbilarna ig\u00e5r och idag |first=Christer |last=Olsson |year=1990 |publisher=F\u00f6rlagshuset Norden |language=Swedish |isbn=978-91-86442-76-7}}</ref> Hesselman engines use the ultra [[lean-burn]] principle; fuel is injected toward the end of the compression stroke, then ignited with a [[spark plug]].

German direct injection petrol engines used injection systems developed by [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] from their diesel injection systems. Later versions of the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] and [[Wright R-3350]] used single point fuel injection, at the time called \"Pressure Carburettor\". Due to the wartime relationship between Germany and Japan, Mitsubishi also had two radial aircraft engines using fuel injection, the [[Mitsubishi Kinsei]] (''kinsei'' means \"venus\") and the [[Mitsubishi Kasei]] (''kasei'' means \"mars\").\n\nAlfa Romeo tested one of the first '''electronic''' injection systems ([[Caproni]]-Fuscaldo) in [[Alfa Romeo 6C]] 2500 with \"Ala spessa\" body in 1940 [[Mille Miglia]].

The Hesselman engine was a low compression design constructed to run on heavy fuel oils.\n\nDirect gasoline injection was applied during the [[World War II|Second World War]] to almost all higher-output production aircraft powerplants made in Germany (the widely used [[BMW 801]] radial, and the popular inverted inline V12 [[Daimler-Benz DB 601]], [[DB 603]], and [[DB 605]], along with the similar [[Junkers Jumo 210]]G, [[Jumo 211]], and [[Jumo 213]], starting as early as 1937 for both the Jumo 210G and DB 601), the Soviet Union ([[Shvetsov ASh-82]]FN radial, 1943, Chemical Automatics Design Bureau - [[Chemical Automatics Design Bureau|KB Khimavtomatika]]) and the USA ([[Wright R-3350]] ''Duplex Cyclone'' radial, 1944).\n\nImmediately following the war, [[hot rod]]der [[Stuart Hilborn]] started to offer mechanical injection for race cars, [[salt cars]], and [[midget car racing|midget racer]]s,<ref>''Circle Track'', 9/84, pp.82-3.</ref> well-known and easily distinguishable because of their prominent [[velocity stack]]s projecting upwards from the engines on which they were used.\n\nThe first automotive direct injection system used to run on gasoline was developed by [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]], and was introduced by [[Goliath (car)|Goliath]] for their [[Goliath GP700]] automobile, and [[Gutbrod]] in 1952. This was basically a specially lubricated high-pressure diesel direct-injection pump of the type that is governed by the vacuum behind an intake throttle valve. (Modern diesels only change the amount of fuel injected to vary output; there is no throttle.) This system used a normal gasoline fuel pump, to provide fuel to a mechanically driven injection pump, which had separate plungers per injector to deliver a very high injection pressure directly into the combustion chamber. The 1954 [[Mercedes-Benz W196]] [[Formula 1]] racing car engine used [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] direct injection derived from wartime aircraft engines. Following this racetrack success, the 1955 [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]], the first production sports car to use fuel injection, used direct injection. The 1955 [[Mercedes-Benz 300SLR]], in which [[Stirling Moss]] drove to victory in the 1955 [[Mille Miglia]] and [[Pierre Levegh]] crashed and died in the [[1955 Le Mans disaster]], had an engine developed from the W196 engine. The Bosch fuel injectors were placed into the bores on the cylinder wall used by the spark plugs in other Mercedes-Benz six-cylinder engines (the spark plugs were relocated to the cylinder head). Later, more mainstream applications of fuel injection favored the less-expensive indirect injection methods.\n\n[[File:1959 Chevrolet Corvette C1 V8 283 cui Fuel Injection.jpg|thumb|right|A 1959 [[Chevrolet Corvette (C1)|Corvette]] small-block 4.6 litre V8 with Rochester mechanical fuel injection]]\n[[Chevrolet]] introduced a mechanical fuel injection option, made by [[General Motors]]' [[Rochester Products Division]], for its [[Chevrolet small-block engine|283 V8 engine]] in 1956 (1957 U.S. [[model year]]). This system directed the inducted engine air across a \"spoon shaped\" plunger that moved in proportion to the air volume. The plunger connected to the fuel metering system that mechanically dispensed fuel to the cylinders via distribution tubes. This system was not a \"pulse\" or intermittent injection, but rather a constant flow system, metering fuel to all cylinders simultaneously from a central \"spider\" of injection lines. The fuel meter adjusted the amount of flow according to engine speed and load, and included a fuel reservoir, which was similar to a carburetor's float chamber. With its own high-pressure fuel pump driven by a cable from the distributor to the fuel meter, the system supplied the necessary pressure for injection. This was a \"port\" injection where the injectors are located in the intake manifold, very near the intake valve.\n\nIn 1956, [[Lucas Industries|Lucas]] developed its injection system, which was first used for [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] racing cars at [[Le Mans]]. The system was subsequently adopted very successfully in [[Formula One]] racing, securing championships by [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]], [[British Racing Motors|BRM]], [[Team Lotus|Lotus]], [[Brabham]], [[Equipe Matra Sports|Matra]], and [[Tyrrell Racing|Tyrrell]] in the years 1959 through 1973.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.lucasinjection.com/HISTORY.htm |title=A short history of Lucas injection |publisher=lucasinjection.com |accessdate=2015-05-01}}</ref> While the racing systems used a simple ''fuel cam'' for metering, a more sophisticated ''Mk 2'' vacuum based ''shuttle metering'' was developed for production cars. This mechanical system was used by some [[Maserati]], [[Aston Martin]], and [[Triumph Motor Company|Triumph]] models between 1963 and 1975.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lucasinjection.com/Lucas%20Mk2%20manual%20page%209.htm |title=Petrol Injection Mk II |publisher=Lucas Service Training Centre |accessdate=2015-05-01}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s, other mechanical injection systems such as Hilborn were occasionally used on modified American [[V8 engine]]s in various racing applications such as [[drag racing]], [[oval racing]], and [[road racing]].<ref name=\"howgood\">{{cite journal |last=Walton |first=Harry |title=How Good is Fuel Injection? |journal=Popular Science |date=March 1957 |volume=170 |issue=3 |pages=88\u201393 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=byEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA88 |accessdate=2015-05-01}}</ref> These racing-derived systems were not suitable for everyday street use, having no provisions for low speed metering, or often none even for starting (starting required that fuel be squirted into the injector tubes while cranking the engine). However, they were a favorite in the aforementioned competition trials in which essentially wide-open throttle operation was prevalent. Constant-flow injection systems continue to be used at the highest levels of drag racing, where full-throttle, high-RPM performance is key.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://www.hotrod.com/techarticles/engine/hrdp_1010_what_you_need_to_know_about_mechanical_fuel_injection/index.html |first=Marlan |last=Davis |title=What You Need To Know About Mechanical Fuel Injection |journal=Hot Rod Magazine |date=October 2010 |accessdate=2015-05-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, one of the first Japanese designed cars to use mechanical fuel injection was the [[Daihatsu Compagno]].\n\nAnother mechanical system, made by [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] called [[Jetronic]], but injecting the fuel into the port above the intake valve, was used by several European car makers, particularly Porsche from 1969 until 1973 in the 911 production range and until 1975 on the Carrera 3.0 in Europe. Porsche continued using this system on its racing cars into the late seventies and early eighties. Porsche racing variants such as the 911 RSR 2.7 & 3.0, 904/6, 906, 907, 908, 910, 917 (in its regular normally aspirated or 5.5 Liter/1500&nbsp;HP turbocharged form), and 935 all used Bosch or [[Kugelfischer]] built variants of injection. The early Bosch Jetronic systems were also used by Audi, Volvo, BMW, Volkswagen, and many others. The Kugelfischer system was also used by the BMW 2000/2002 Tii and some versions of the Peugeot 404/504 and Lancia Flavia.\n\nA system similar to the Bosch inline mechanical pump was built by [[SPICA]] for Alfa Romeo, used on the [[Alfa Romeo Montreal]] and on U.S. market 1750 and 2000 models from 1969 to 1981. This was designed to meet the U.S. emission requirements with no loss in performance and it also reduced fuel consumption.\n\n===={{anchor|EFI|electronic}}Electronic injection====\nBecause mechanical injection systems have limited adjustments to develop the optimal amount of fuel into an engine that needs to operate under a variety of different conditions (such as when starting, the engine's speed and load, atmospheric and engine temperatures, altitude, ignition timing, etc.) electronic fuel injection (EFI) systems were developed that relied on numerous sensors and controls. When working together, these electronic components can sense variations and the main system computes the appropriate amount of fuel needed to achieve better engine performance based on a stored \"map\" of optimal settings for given requirements.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Hqsyv_KD0lgC&pg=PA113&dq=Electronic+vs+mechanical+fuel+injection |page=133 |title=Air pollution from motor vehicles; standards and technologies for controlling emissions |first=Asif |last=Faiz |first2=Christopher S. |last2=Weaver |first3=Michael P. |last3=Walsh |first4=Surhid P. |last4=Gautam |publisher=The World Bank |year=1996 |isbn=9780821334447 |access-date=2017-08-26}}</ref>  in 1953, the [[Bendix Corporation]] began exploring the idea of an electronic fuel injection system as a way eliminate the well known problems of traditional carburetors.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Rambler Rebel\u2019s fuel injection \u2013 The Dream and the Legend |url= https://www.hemmings.com/blog/2017/06/25/the-rambler-rebels-fuel-injection-the-dream-and-the-legend/ |publisher=Hemmings |accessdate=2018-11-08 |date=2017-06-27}}</ref>\n\nThe first commercial EFI system was the \"Electrojector\" developed by Bendix and was offered by [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]] (AMC) in 1957.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60C16FD355A137A93C6AB1788D85F438585F9 |last=Ingraham |first=Joseph C. |title=Automobiles: Races; Everybody Manages to Win Something At the Daytona Beach Contests |newspaper=The New York Times |date=1957-03-24 |page=153 |accessdate=2015-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal=Consumer Reports |year=1957 |volume=22 |title=1957 cars |page=154}}</ref> The [[Rambler Rebel]], showcased AMC's new [[AMC V8 engine#327|{{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine]].<ref>{{cite web |title=1957 Rambler Rebel promotional flyers |url=http://www3.ohio.net/~dsiringer/omcover/1950/1957%20Rebel%20Flyer.JPG |website=ohio.net |accessdate=2018-11-08}}</ref> The Electrojector was an option and rated at {{convert|288|bhp|kW|1|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book |last=Holder |first=William |last2=Kunz |first2=Phil |title=Extreme Muscle Cars: The Factory Lightweight Legacy |publisher=Krause Publications |year=2006 |page=16 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Pn8cAHTaaKQC&pg=PA16 |isbn=978-0-89689-278-1 |accessdate=2015-05-01}}</ref> The EFI produced peak [[torque]] 500 [[revolutions per minute|rpm]] lower than the equivalent [[carburetor]]ed engine<ref name=\"howgood\"/> The Rebel Owners Manual described the design and operation of the new system.<ref name=\"excerpts\">{{cite web |title=An Invitation to Happy Motoring...

Most of the 35 vehicles originally so equipped were field-retrofitted with 4-barrel carburetors. The Electrojector patents were subsequently sold to Bosch.\n\nBosch developed an electronic fuel injection system, called ''[[Jetronic#D-Jetronic (1967\u20131976)|D-Jetronic]]'' (''D'' for ''Druck'', German for \"pressure\"), which was first used on the [[Volkswagen Type 3|VW 1600TL/E]] in 1967. This was a speed/density system, using engine speed and intake manifold air density to calculate \"air mass\" flow rate and thus fuel requirements. This system was adopted by [[Volkswagen|VW]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Porsche]], [[Citro\u00ebn]], [[Saab Automobile|Saab]], and [[Volvo Cars|Volvo]]. Lucas licensed the system for production in [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] cars, initially in D-Jetronic form before switching to L-Jetronic in 1978 on the [[Jaguar XK6 engine|XK6 engine]].\n\nBosch superseded the D-Jetronic system with the ''[[Jetronic#K-Jetronic (1974\u20131988)|K-Jetronic]]'' and ''[[L-Jetronic]]'' systems for 1974, though some cars (such as the [[Volvo 164]]) continued using D-Jetronic for the following several years. In 1970, the [[Isuzu 117 Coup\u00e9]] was introduced with a Bosch-supplied D-Jetronic fuel injected engine sold only in Japan. In 1984 Rover fitted [[Lucas Industries|Lucas]] electronic fuel injection, which was based on some L-Jetronic patents, to the [[BL S-Series engine|S-Series engine]] as used in the [[Rover 200 / 25#Rover 200 .28SD3.3B 1984.E2.80.931989.29|200 model]].\n\n[[File:1976 Cosworth Vega engine (Bendix Electronic Fuel Injection).jpg|thumb|Chevrolet Cosworth Vega engine showing Bendix electronic fuel injection (in orange).]]\n\nIn Japan, the [[Toyota Celica]] used electronic, multi-port fuel injection in the optional [[Toyota R engine#18R-E|18R-E]] engine in January 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://members.iinet.net.au/~stepho/manuals/Celica/JapSpecsCelica1.tiff |title=Celica Parts Catalogue |publisher=Toyota |language=Japanese |accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref> Nissan offered electronic, multi-port fuel injection in 1975 with the Bosch L-Jetronic system used in the [[Nissan L engine#L28E|Nissan L28E engine]] and installed in the [[Nissan Fairlady Z]], [[Nissan Cedric]], and the [[Nissan Gloria]]. Nissan also installed multi-point fuel injection in the [[Nissan Y engine|Nissan Y44 V8 engine]] in the [[Nissan President]]. Toyota soon followed with the same technology in 1978 on the [[Toyota M engine#4M|4M-E]] engine installed in the [[Toyota Crown]], the [[Toyota Supra]], and the [[Toyota Mark II]]. In the 1980s, the [[Isuzu Piazza]] and the [[Mitsubishi Starion]] added fuel injection as standard equipment, developed separately with both companies history of diesel powered engines. 1981 saw Mazda offer fuel injection in the [[Mazda Luce]] with the [[Mazda F engine#FE|Mazda FE engine]] and, in 1983, Subaru offered fuel injection in the [[Subaru EA-81|Subaru EA81]] engine installed in the [[Subaru Leone]]. Honda followed in 1984 with their own system, called PGM-FI in the [[Honda Accord]], and the [[Honda Vigor]] using the [[Honda E engine#ES|Honda ES3 engine]].\n\nThe limited production [[Chevrolet Cosworth Vega]] was introduced in March 1975 using a Bendix EFI system with pulse-time manifold injection, four injector valves, an electronic control unit (ECU), five independent sensors, and two fuel pumps. The EFI system was developed to satisfy stringent emission control requirements and market demands for a technologically advanced responsive vehicle. 5000 hand-built Cosworth Vega engines were produced but only 3,508 cars were sold through 1976.<ref>1975 Chevrolet Cosworth Vega Overhaul Supplement - general information</ref>\n\nThe [[Cadillac Seville]] was introduced in 1975 with an EFI system made by Bendix and modelled very closely on Bosch's D-Jetronic. L-Jetronic first appeared on the 1974 Porsche 914, and uses a mechanical airflow meter (L for '''''Luft''''', German for \"air\") that produces a signal that is proportional to \"air volume\". This approach required additional sensors to measure the [[atmospheric pressure]] and temperature, to ultimately calculate \"air mass\". L-Jetronic was widely adopted on European cars of that period, and a few Japanese models a short time later.\n\nIn 1980, [[Motorola]] (now [[NXP Semiconductors]]) introduced the first electronic [[engine control unit]], the [[Ford EEC#EEC-III|EEC-III]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.motorola.com/staticfiles/Consumers/Corporate/US-EN/_Documents/Motorola_History_Timeline.pdf |title=A Timeline Overview of Motorola History 1928-2009 |publisher=Motorola |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110620224820/http://www.motorola.com/staticfiles/Consumers/Corporate/US-EN/_Documents/Motorola_History_Timeline.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-20 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref> Its integrated control of engine functions (such as fuel injection and spark timing) is now the standard approach for fuel injection systems. The Motorola technology was installed in [[Ford EEC|Ford]] North American products.\n<!-- In 1981 Chrysler Corporation introduced an EFI system featuring a sensor that directly measures the air mass flow into the engine, on the Imperial automobile (5.2&nbsp;L V8) as standard equipment. The mass air sensor utilizes a heated platinum wire placed in the incoming air flow. The rate of the wire's cooling is proportional to the air mass flowing across the wire. Since the hot wire sensor directly measures air mass, the need for additional temperature and pressure sensors was eliminated. This system was independently developed and engineered in Highland Park, Michigan and manufactured at Chrysler's Electronics division in Huntsville, Alabama.<ref>{{cite web |first=Matthew |last=Litwin |url=http://www.hemmings.com/hcc/stories/2008/07/01/hmn_feature22.html |title=1981-1983 Chrysler Imperial |publisher=Hemmings.com |date=2008-07 |accessdate=2012-02-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imperialclub.com/Yr/1981/81EFI/Cover.htm |title=1981-1983 Imperial EFI Troubleshooting Guide |publisher=Imperialclub.com |date=2007-08-04 |accessdate=2012-02-09}}</ref> *** need proof it was the first car to use MAF for this to be significant -->\n\n==Elimination of carburetors==\nIn the 1970s and 1980s in the U.S. and Japan, the respective federal governments imposed increasingly strict [[automobile emissions control|exhaust emission]] regulations. During that time period, the vast majority of gasoline-fueled automobile and light truck engines did not use fuel injection. To comply with the new regulations, automobile manufacturers often made extensive and complex modifications to the engine carburetor(s). While a simple carburetor system is cheaper to manufacture than a fuel injection system, the more complex carburetor systems installed on many engines in the 1970s were much more costly than the earlier simple carburetors. To more easily comply with emissions regulations, automobile manufacturers began installing fuel injection systems in more gasoline engines during the late 1970s.\n\n[[Open-loop controller|Open-loop]] fuel injection systems had already improved cylinder-to-cylinder fuel distribution and engine operation over a wide temperature range, but did not offer further scope to sufficiently control fuel/air mixtures, in order to further reduce exhaust emissions. Later [[feedback controller|closed-loop]] fuel injection systems improved the air\u2013fuel mixture control with an [[exhaust gas]] [[oxygen sensor]]. Although not part of the injection control, a [[catalytic converter]] further reduces exhaust emissions.\n\nFuel injection was phased in through the latter 1970s and 80s at an accelerating rate, with the German, French, and U.S. markets leading and the UK and Commonwealth markets lagging somewhat. Since the early 1990s, almost all gasoline passenger cars sold in [[first world]] markets are equipped with electronic fuel injection (EFI). In Brazil, carburetors were entirely replaced by fuel injection during the 1990s, with the first EFI equipped model built in 1989 (the [[Volkswagen Gol]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/noticias/grandes-brasileiros-volkswagen-gol-gti-30-anos/|title=Grandes Brasileiros: Volkswagen Gol GTi completa 30 anos|website=Quatro Rodas|language=pt-BR|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref> The carburetor remains in use in developing countries where vehicle emissions are unregulated and diagnostic and repair infrastructure is sparse. Fuel injection is gradually replacing carburetors in these nations too as they adopt emission regulations conceptually similar to those in force in Europe, Japan, Australia, and North America.\n\nMany motorcycles still use carburetored engines, though all current high-performance designs have switched to EFI.\n\n[[NASCAR]] finally replaced carburetors with fuel-injection, starting at the beginning of the [[2012 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]] season.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/nascar/2011-02-11-nascar-fuel-injection_N.htm |title=NASCAR sets fuel injection for '12 but keeping restrictor plates |first=Nate |last=Ryan |date=2011-11-02 |newspaper=USA Today |accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoserviceworld.com/news/nascar-moves-to-fuel-injection-bosch-first-approved-supplier/1000522267/ |title=NASCAR Moves to Fuel Injection, Bosch First Approved Supplier |publisher=Auto Service World |date=2011-07-18 |accessdate=2014-01-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201224457/http://www.autoserviceworld.com/news/nascar-moves-to-fuel-injection-bosch-first-approved-supplier/1000522267/ |archivedate=2014-02-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nascar.com/news/111020/bosch-sensors-fuel-injection/index.html |title=Bosch to provide oxygen sensors for fuel injection |publisher=NASCAR.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225011421/http://www.nascar.com/news/111020/bosch-sensors-fuel-injection/index.html |archivedate=2011-12-25 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref>\n\n==System components==\n\n===System overview===\nThe process of determining the necessary amount of fuel, and its delivery into the engine, are known as fuel metering. Early injection systems used mechanical methods to meter fuel, while nearly all modern systems use electronic metering.\n\n===Determining how much fuel to supply===\n<!-- this might be better as a diagram/schematic -->\nThe primary factor used in determining the amount of fuel required by the engine is the amount (by weight) of air that is being taken in by the engine for use in combustion. Modern systems use a mass airflow sensor to send this information to the [[engine control unit]].\n\nData representing the amount of power output desired by the driver (sometimes known as \"engine load\") is also used by the [[engine control unit]] in calculating the amount of fuel required. A throttle position sensor (TPS) provides this information. Other engine sensors used in EFI systems include a coolant temperature sensor, a camshaft or crankshaft position sensor (some systems get the position information from the distributor), and an oxygen sensor which is installed in the exhaust system so that it can be used to determine how well the fuel has been combusted, therefore allowing [[Feedback controller|closed loop]] operation.\n\n===Supplying the fuel to the engine===\nFuel is transported from the fuel tank (via fuel lines) and pressurised using fuel pump(s). Maintaining the correct fuel pressure is done by a fuel pressure regulator. Often a [[fuel rail]] is used to divide the fuel supply into the required number of cylinders. The fuel injector injects liquid fuel into the intake air (the location of the fuel injector varies between systems).\n\nUnlike carburetor-based systems, where the [[float chamber]] provides a reservoir, fuel injected systems depend on an uninterrupted flow of fuel. To avoid [[fuel starvation]] when subject to lateral [[G-forces]], vehicles are often provided with an [[anti-surge]] vessel, usually integrated in the [[fuel tank]], but sometimes as a separate, small anti-surge tank.\n\n===EFI gasoline engine components===\n<blockquote>\n''These examples specifically apply to a modern EFI gasoline engine. Parallels to fuels other than gasoline can be made, but only conceptually.''\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Injector3.gif|thumb|right|350px|Animated cut through diagram of a typical fuel injector.

The ECU interprets data from input sensors to, among other tasks, calculate the appropriate amount of fuel to inject.\n\n===Fuel injector===\nWhen signaled by the [[engine control unit]] the fuel injector opens and sprays the pressurised fuel into the engine. The duration that the injector is open (called the [[pulse-width modulation|pulse width]]) is proportional to the amount of fuel delivered. Depending on the system design, the timing of when injector opens is either relative each individual cylinder (for a sequential fuel injection (SFI) system), or injectors for multiple cylinders may be signalled to open at the same time (in a batch fire system).\n\n==Target air\u2013fuel ratios==\nThe relative proportions of air and fuel vary according to the type of fuel used and the performance requirements (i.e. power, fuel economy, or exhaust emissions).\n\nSee [[Air\u2013fuel ratio]], [[Stoichiometry]], and [[Combustion]].\n\n==Various injection schemes==\n{{More footnotes|date=May 2010}}\n\n==={{Anchor|TBI|EGI|CFI|SPI|Throttle body injection}}Single-point injection===\nSingle-point injection (SPI) uses a single injector at the [[throttle body]] (the same location as was used by carburetors).\n\nIt was introduced in the 1940s in large aircraft engines (then called the [[pressure carburetor]]) and in the 1980s in the automotive world (called Throttle-body Injection by [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], Central Fuel Injection by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], PGM-CARB by Honda, and EGI by [[Mazda]]). Since the fuel passes through the intake runners (like a carburetor system), it is called a \"wet manifold system\".\n\nThe justification for single-point injection was low cost. Many of the carburetor's supporting components - such as the air cleaner, intake manifold, and fuel line routing - could be reused. This postponed the redesign and tooling costs of these components. Single-point injection was used extensively on American-made passenger cars and light trucks during 1980\u20131995, and in some European cars in the early and mid-1990s.\n\n===Continuous injection===\nIn a continuous injection system, fuel flows at all times from the fuel injectors, but at a variable flow rate. This is in contrast to most fuel injection systems, which provide fuel during short pulses of varying duration, with a constant rate of flow during each pulse. Continuous injection systems can be multi-point or single-point, but not direct.\n\nThe most common automotive continuous injection system is Bosch's [[Jetronic#K|K-Jetronic]], introduced in 1974. K-Jetronic was used for many years between 1974 and the mid-1990s by [[BMW]], [[Lamborghini]], [[Ferrari]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Volkswagen]], [[Ford]], [[Porsche]], [[Audi]], [[Saab Automobile|Saab]], [[DeLorean Motor Company|DeLorean]], and [[Volvo]]. Chrysler used a continuous fuel injection system on the 1981-1983 [[Imperial (automobile)#1981\u20131983|Imperial]].\n\nIn piston aircraft engines, continuous-flow fuel injection is the most common type. In contrast to automotive fuel injection systems, aircraft continuous flow fuel injection is all [[mechanical fuel injection|mechanical]], requiring no electricity to operate. Two common types exist: the Bendix RSA system, and the [[Teledyne Continental Motors|TCM]] system. The Bendix system is a direct descendant of the [[pressure carburetor]]. However, instead of having a discharge valve in the barrel, it uses a ''flow divider'' mounted on top of the engine, which controls the discharge rate and evenly distributes the fuel to stainless steel injection lines to the intake ports of each cylinder. The TCM system is even more simple. It has no venturi, no pressure chambers, no diaphragms, and no discharge valve. The control unit is fed by a constant-pressure fuel pump. The control unit simply uses a butterfly valve for the air, which is linked by a mechanical linkage to a rotary valve for the fuel. Inside the control unit is another restriction, which controls the fuel mixture. The pressure drop across the restrictions in the control unit controls the amount of fuel flow, so that fuel flow is directly proportional to the pressure at the flow divider. In fact, most aircraft that use the TCM fuel injection system feature a fuel flow gauge that is actually a pressure gauge calibrated in ''gallons per hour'' or ''pounds per hour'' of fuel.\n\n===Central port injection===\nFrom 1992 to 1996 [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] implemented a system called Central Port Injection or Central Port Fuel Injection. The system uses tubes with poppet valves from a central injector to spray fuel at each intake port rather than the central throttle-body{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}. Fuel pressure is similar to a single-point injection system. CPFI (used from 1992 to 1995) is a [[#Fuel injector|batch-fire]] system, while CSFI (from 1996) is a sequential system.<ref>1997 Chevrolet Truck Service Manual, page 6A-24, drawing, item (3) Central Sequential Muliport injector.</ref>\n\n===Multipoint fuel injection{{Anchor|Multiport fuel injection|MPI|MPFI}}===<!-- old section name to keep old links working -->\nMultipoint fuel injection (MPI), also called port fuel injection (PFI), injects fuel into the intake ports just upstream of each cylinder's intake valve, rather than at a central point within an intake manifold. MPI systems can be ''sequential'', in which injection is timed to coincide with each cylinder's intake stroke; ''batched'', in which fuel is injected to the cylinders in groups, without precise synchronization to any particular cylinder's intake stroke; or ''simultaneous'', in which fuel is injected at the same time to all the cylinders. The intake is only slightly wet, and typical fuel pressure runs between 40-60 psi.\n\nMany modern EFI systems use sequential MPI; however, in newer gasoline engines, direct injection systems are beginning to replace sequential ones.\n\n===Direct injection===\n{{See also|Common rail}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2010}}\n\nIn a direct injection engine, fuel is injected into the combustion chamber as opposed to injection before the [[intake valve]] (petrol engine) or a separate pre-combustion chamber (diesel engine).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.unep.org/transport/gfei/autotool/approaches/technology/ic_engines.asp |title=IC Engines |work=Global Fuel Economy Initiative |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121006095155/http://www.unep.org/transport/gfei/autotool/approaches/technology/ic_engines.asp#gasoline |archivedate=2012-10-06 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref>\n\nIn a [[common rail]] system, the fuel from the fuel tank is supplied to the common header (called the accumulator). This fuel is then sent through tubing to the injectors, which inject it into the combustion chamber. The header has a high pressure relief valve to maintain the pressure in the header and return the excess fuel to the fuel tank. The fuel is sprayed with the help of a nozzle that is opened and closed with a needle valve, operated with a solenoid. When the solenoid is not activated, the spring forces the needle valve into the nozzle passage and prevents the injection of fuel into the cylinder. The solenoid lifts the needle valve from the valve seat, and fuel under pressure is sent in the engine cylinder. Third-generation common rail diesels use [[piezoelectric]] injectors for increased precision, with fuel pressures up to {{convert|1800|bar|psi|abbr=on|lk=on|disp=or}}.\n\nDirect fuel injection costs more than indirect injection systems: the injectors are exposed to more heat and pressure, so more costly materials and higher-precision electronic management systems are required.\n\n====Diesel engines====\nAll diesel engines have fuel injected into the combustion chamber.\n\nEarlier systems, relying on simpler injectors, often injected into a sub-chamber shaped to swirl the compressed air and improve combustion; this was known as [[indirect injection]]. However, this was less efficient than the now common direct injection in which initiation of combustion takes place in a depression (often [[toroid (geometry)|toroidal]]) in the crown of the piston.\n\nThroughout the early history of diesels, they were always fed by a mechanical pump with a small separate chamber for each cylinder, feeding separate fuel lines and individual injectors.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Most such pumps were in-line, though some were rotary.\n\nMost modern diesel engines use [[common rail]] or [[unit injector]] direct injection systems. A special type of direct injection system is the [[M-System]], that was used throughout the second half of the 20th century.\n\n====Gasoline engines{{anchor|Petrol/gasoline engines}}====\n{{Main article|Gasoline direct injection}}\n\nModern [[petrol engine|gasoline engine]]s also use direct injection, which is referred to as [[gasoline direct injection]]. This is the next step in evolution from multi-point fuel injection, and offers another magnitude of emission control by eliminating the \"wet\" portion of the induction system along the inlet tract.\n\nBy virtue of better [[dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]] and [[homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneity]] of the directly injected fuel, the cylinder and piston are cooled, thereby permitting higher [[compression ratio]]s and earlier [[ignition timing]], with resultant enhanced [[power (physics)|power]] output. More precise management of the fuel injection event also enables better control of emissions. Finally, the homogeneity of the fuel mixture allows for leaner air\u2013fuel ratios, which together with more precise ignition timing can improve [[fuel efficiency]]. Along with this, the engine can operate with stratified ([[lean-burn]]) mixtures, and hence avoid throttling losses at low and part engine load. Some direct-injection systems incorporate [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectronic]] fuel injectors. With their extremely fast response time, multiple injection events can occur during each cycle of each cylinder of the engine.\n\n===Swirl injection===\nSwirl injectors are used in liquid rocket, gas turbine, and diesel engines to improve atomization and mixing efficiency.\n\nThe circumferential velocity component is first generated as the propellant enters through helical or tangential inlets producing a thin, swirling liquid sheet. A gas-filled hollow core is then formed along the centerline inside the injector due to centrifugal force of the liquid sheet. Because of the presence of the gas core, the discharge coefficient is generally low. In swirl injector, the spray cone angle is controlled by the ratio of the circumferential velocity to the axial velocity and is generally wide compared with nonswirl injectors.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Comparative Study of Spray Characteristics of Gas-Centered and Liquid-Centered Swirl Coaxial Injectors |last=Ji-Hyuk |first=Im |last2=Seongho |first2=Cho |last3=Youngbin |first3=Yoon |last4=Insang |first4=Moon |journal=Journal of Propulsion and Power |year=2010}}</ref>\n\n==Maintenance hazards==\nFuel injection introduces potential hazards in engine maintenance due to the high fuel pressures used. Residual pressure can remain in the fuel lines long after an injection-equipped engine has been shut down. This residual pressure must be relieved, and if it is done so by external bleed-off, the fuel must be safely contained. If a high-pressure diesel fuel injector is removed from its seat and operated in open air, there is a risk to the operator of injury by [[Jet injector#Accidental jet injection|hypodermic jet-injection]], even with only {{convert|100|psi|bar|abbr=on}} pressure.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Agha |first=F.P. |title=High-pressure paint gun injuries of hand: clinical and roentgen aspects |journal=NY State Journal of Medicine |volume=78 |issue= |pages=1955\u20136 |year=1978}}</ref> The first known such injury occurred in 1937 during a diesel engine maintenance operation.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rees |first=C.E. |title=Penetration of Tissue by Fuel Oil Under High Pressure from a Diesel Engine |journal=Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=109 |issue=11 |pages=866\u20137 |year=1937 |doi=10.1001/jama.1937.92780370004012c |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n;Patents\n*{{US patent|3430616}} \u2014 ''Fuel Injection Control System'' \u2014 Otto Gl\u00f6ckler, et al.\n*{{US patent|3500801}} \u2014 ''Actuator Circuit for Electronic Precision Fuel Metering Systems'' \u2014 E.

He argued that the trial courts had used an incorrect definition of obscenity.  Rabe argued that Roth required the courts to consider the movie as a whole and that the lower courts should not have ruled that scenes taken out of context were obscene to those outside the theater.\n\nThe Washington Supreme Court began by saying that they were as confused about what constituted obscenity as anyone else: \"...our resolution of the challenge must necessarily be guided by the United States Supreme Court's troubled and often confusing explication of what expression constitutes obscenity and what expression is entitled to the protective liberties of the federal constitution's First Amendment.

Rabe's conviction was therefore affirmed.\n\n==Decision==\nThe Supreme Court's opinion was delivered as a [[Per curiam decision|''per curiam'' one]]; meaning that it was the opinion of the Court acting as a collective body and not one Justice's opinion.  Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] authored a concurrence opinion, joined by Justice [[William Rehnquist]].  The majority opinion avoided the obscenity issue, instead accepting the Washington Supreme Courts's determination that the film did not meet the Roth definition of obscene.  The Court noted that neither context nor location were part of the crime Rabe supposedly committed: \"[Rabe's] conviction was thus affirmed under a statute with a meaning quite different from the one he was charged with violating.\"<ref name=\"Rabe\" />{{rp|315}}  Rabe had no notice that showing the same film in an indoor theater was permissible but that showing it in a drive-in was not.

On 29 August 1968, William Rabe, the manager of a [[Drive-in theater|drive-in movie theater]] in [[Richland, Washington|Richland]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], was arrested on [[obscenity]] charges for showing the film ''[[Carmen, Baby]]''.  Due to [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment concerns]], the local court convicted Rabe not on the basis that the film as a whole was obscene, but that exhibiting it in a drive-in theater was.
