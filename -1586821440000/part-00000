His father never responds to questions about his mother. Other important people in his life are his father's friend Hamzakoya ([[Mamukkoya]]) and his friend Beeran ([[Hareesh Perumanna]]).\n\nOne day, Hamid is at a marriage party with Beeran and Beeran is suddenly called by Hamzakoya. He informs Beeran that Hamid's father just died. The death of his father makes Hamid sad since he believes that he now has no family, even though Beeran and Hamzakkoya tells him that they are with him. To pull him out of his loneliness, Hamzakkoya and Beeran advise him to get married.\n\nHe meets Sainaba. Even though Hamid and Sainaba likes each other, Sainaba's father does not want them to marry, stating that Hamid is an orphan. This makes Hamid even sadder. He continues his life looking after his antiques shop with Beeran.\n\nOne day while clearing junk from his house he finds his father's will, which states that Hamid's father had 2 wives, one in Kozhikode and another in [[Ponnani]]. It said that Haider's land must be split into three and two parts must be given to his two wives and one to charity. Hamid sells the land and decides to visit the two widows to give them their inheritance, hoping that one of them would turn out to be his mother.\n\nHe travels to Kozhikode to meet Ramlath ([[Shanthi Krishna]]) with Beeran. On reaching Kozhikode he meets Shivan ([[Dileesh Pothan]]) a former employee of his father. He asks him about his mother, but does not get promising answers. On reaching Ramlath's house they are shooed away by her arrogant brother ([[Siddhique]]) after Hamid tells him that he is Haidar's son. The next day they catch the husband with another woman. They pressurize him and he agrees to let them meet Ramlathumma. Hamid hands over her share of the land but confirms that she is not his mother and thus he confirms that Aishumma ([[Urvasi]]) in Ponnani should be his mother. He set off to Ponnani to meet her. He meets Aishumma and takes her home.\n\nThough she is very kind and caring with Hamid, she was not so with Hamzakoya and Beeran. They are unhappy about Aishumma's arrogant nature and Hamzakoya visits Ponnani to gather information about her. He comes to know that she is not Hamid's mother. He then while sitting inside his antique shop, a customer comes to buy records for gramophone. He accidentally discovers a postcard inside a record cover.  While trying to discuss the price, Hamid gives him the record for free. Since the letter was written in Urdu, he gets it read and explained to him that the letter was sent by Laila Begum, from Firdous Quila, Lucknow. He then plans to visit Lucknow to find out. Aishumma bluffs that she had been to Lucknow 2\u20133 times with his father. He discovers while reaching Lucknow that she has taken him for a ride about her knowing of the place and it is her first visit. They then reach a lodge and settles down. While asleep, Aishumma steals and hides that post card. She then tries to force Hamid to show her around the city. Hamid tries to reach out to Sivankutty, to find a lead. Hamid gets an address from him about an antique shop. He writes it down in a piece of paper and starts to search the shop, since he does not know to read Urdu and Hindi. The story then leads to the final conclusion that Begum Laila was his mother and to confirm he finds that his look-alike son comes riding a motorcycle. But she is now married and has her son getting married next day. He leaves the place tearing off the post card for good and return to his home with accepting Aishumma as his own mother. His friend Beeran calls up and informs that Sainabas father has died and now he can marry her and the film ends.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tovino Thomas]] as \u1e24am\u012bd Hyderali / \u1e24am\u012bd's twin\n* [[Urvashi (actress)|Urvashi]] as \u0100\u2019ishah\n* [[Hareesh Perumanna]] as B\u012bran\n* [[Mammukoya]] as \u1e24amzah K\u014dya\n* [[Saara Deva|Sai Priya Deva]] as Sainaba\n* [[Siddique (actor)|Siddique]] as Zakker\n* [[Shanthi Krishna]] as Ramlath \n* [[Dileesh Pothan]] as Shivankutty\n* Ramu as Moideen\n* Vijayan Karanthoor as Hassan ikka\n* [[Raghavan (actor)|Raghavan]] as Raghavan\n* [[Shilpa Tulaskar]] as Begum Laylah\n* [[Renji Panicker]] as Mohammed Hyderali Mehfil \n* [[Unniraj Cheruvathur]]as Dance master\n\n==Music==\n\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Singer(s)\n| all_lyrics   = B.

She lived during the reigns of five successive Safavid monarchs, and apart from holding diverse functions, including at the top of the empire's bureaucratic system, she was also the leading [[matriarch]] in the royal [[harem]] for many years, and acted on occasion as kingmaker. She reached the apex of her influence during the early reign of King [[Safi of Persia|Safi]] ({{reign}}1629\u20131649). In numerous contemporaneous sources, she was praised as a \"mainstay of political moderation and wisdom in Safavid court politics\".{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}}\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Tahmasb-1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Painting of Tahmasp I at the [[Chehel Sotoun]] palace]]\nZeynab Begum was born to one of Tahmasp's [[Georgians|Georgian]] wives, a princess named [[Huri-Khan Khanum]].{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}}{{sfn|Szuppe|2003|page=149}} Her date of birth is unknown.{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}} At a young age, Zeynab Begum was assigned a guardian (''[[Lala (title)|laleh]]''), Shah-Qoli Beg, a high-ranking member of the [[Shamlu]] [[Qizilbash]] faction.{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}} When her father died in 1576 and was succeeded by [[Ismail II]] ({{reign}}1576\u20131577), she was given in marriage to [[Ali-Qoli Khan Shamlu]], a grandson of [[Durmish Khan Shamlu]].{{sfn|Babaie|Babayan|Baghdiantz-McCabe|Farhad|2004|page=35}} The marriage took place not long before 7 December 1577, but it was apparently never [[consummated]], for Zeynab Begum continued to live in the royal [[harem]] in the Safavid capital of [[Qazvin]].{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}}{{sfn|Babaie|Babayan|Baghdiantz-McCabe|Farhad|2004|page=35}} \n\nShe played a pivotal role by her support of her nephew, heir-apparent [[Hamzeh Mirza Safavi|Hamzeh Mirza]]. According to a report by [[Iskander Beg Munshi]], Zeynab Begum stood at the head of the royal harem during the frantic civil war that had engulfed the empire in the late 1580s, amidst the [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1578-1590)|Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578\u20131590]].{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}} In the period after Hamzeh Mirza's assassination in late 1586, she was assisted by her personal [[vizier]], [[Mirza Lotfollah Shirazi]], who later became [[List of Safavid Grand Viziers|grand vizier]] of the entire state.{{sfn|Szuppe|2003|pages=153\u2013154}} Thereafter, she functioned as one of the most important supporters of the young prince Abbas (later known by his regnal name of [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]]; {{reign}}1588\u20131629) during the war of succession that had commenced during the last few years of King [[Mohammad Khodabanda]] ({{reign}}1578\u20131587).{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}}\n\n==Consolidation on the political theatre==\n[[File:Abbas_I_of_Persia.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Painting of Abbas I at the Chehel Sotoun palace]]\nIn the first years of Abbas's reign, Zeynab Begum continued to be a close confidant and acted, according to the Italian traveller [[Pietro Della Valle]], as his [[foster mother]].{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}} Even after these years, for as much as the first two decades of his reign, Zeynab Begum functioned as one of Abbas's \"key counselors\".{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}}{{sfn|Szuppe|2003|page=160}} She continued to be the leading [[matriarch]] in the harem, and she oversaw the upbringing of Abbas's sons. It appears that local governors and military chiefs asked her for political intervention on their behalf with Abbas I.{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}}\n\nDuring Abbas's reign, Zeynab Begum was intimately bound to the various administrative affairs of the crown (''khasseh'') sector within the Safavid bureaucracy. Between 1592\u20131593 and 1613\u20131614, she functioned as the governor of the crown sector of [[Kashan]], and had two bureaucrats who acted as her deputies.{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}} During these years, she reportedly owned several villages in the southern outskirts of the city of [[Yazd]]. This allowed her, for most of Abbas's reign, to collect the [[poll tax]] imposed on the domain's [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] community, and to keep it for herself.{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}} Thanks to these monies, she was able to build at least one [[caravanserai]] along the [[Isfahan]]-Kashan route in 1601\u20131602. A year later, she was given the post of the keeper of the seal used for all the royal decrees issued by the empire (''mohrd\u0101r-e sharaf nafadh'').{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}}\n\nIn 1605, during the [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1603-1618)|Ottoman-Safavid War of 1603\u20131618]], she advised Abbas to attack the Ottomans [[Battle of Sufiyan|at Sufian]]; this would result in one of his greatest military victories.{{sfn|Blow|2009|page=173}} She was on occasion included in the highest advisory body, the \"Council of State\"; in 1606, she was the only woman at the briefing.{{sfn|Blow|2009|page=173}}{{sfn|Szuppe|2003|page=160}} According to the Portuguese diplomat [[Antonio de Gouvea]], \"She made it very apparent that she deserved the honour\".{{sfn|Blow|2009|page=173}} Several years later, in 1611\u20131612, she stood at the head of the royal banquet given on the occasion of the arrival of Wali-Mohammad Khan, the [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] ruler of [[Urgench]], who had fled to the Safavid realm following an outbreak of civil war in [[Khwarezm]].{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}}\n\n==Downfall and pardon==\n[[File:Zeynab's will (Safavid).jpg|thumb|110px|Zeynab's [[Will and testament|will]], written in 1629]]\nIn 1613\u20131614, however, Zeynab Begum fell into disgrace. She was expelled from the harem, and all her posts were taken from her. She was subsequently banished to Qazvin, where she lived under [[house arrest]].{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}}{{sfn|Matthee|2012|pages=37, 203}} These events took place amidst several other purges of high-ranking Safavid officials and military leaders who were present at the court in [[Isfahan]]. According to historian [[Fazli Isfahani Khuzani|Fazli Khuzani]], this was the result of actions made by the leading ''[[Ijtihad#Qualifications_of_a_mujtahid|mojtahed]]'' at the Safavid court, Mir Mohammad Baqer Damad.{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}}\n\nZeynab Begum was allowed to re-enter the royal court around four years later.

She lived during the reigns of five successive Safavid monarchs, and apart from holding diverse functions, including at the top of the empire's bureaucratic system, she was also the leading [[matriarch]] in the royal [[harem]] for many years, and acted on occasion as kingmaker. She reached the apex of her influence during the early reign of King [[Safi of Persia|Safi]] ({{reign}}1629\u20131649). In numerous contemporaneous sources, she was praised as a \"mainstay of political moderation and wisdom in Safavid court politics\".{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}}\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Tahmasb-1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Painting of Tahmasp I at the [[Chehel Sotoun]] palace]]\nZeynab Begum was born to one of Tahmasp's [[Georgians|Georgian]] wives, a princess named [[Huri-Khan Khanum]].{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}}{{sfn|Szuppe|2003|page=149}} Her date of birth is unknown.{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}} At a young age, Zeynab Begum was assigned a guardian (''[[Lala (title)|laleh]]''), Shah-Qoli Beg, a high-ranking member of the [[Shamlu]] [[Qizilbash]] faction.{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}} When her father died in 1576 and was succeeded by [[Ismail II]] ({{reign}}1576\u20131577), she was given in marriage to [[Ali-Qoli Khan Shamlu]], a grandson of [[Durmish Khan Shamlu]].{{sfn|Babaie|Babayan|Baghdiantz-McCabe|Farhad|2004|page=35}} The marriage took place not long before 7 December 1577, but it was apparently never [[consummated]], for Zeynab Begum continued to live in the royal [[harem]] in the Safavid capital of [[Qazvin]].{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}}{{sfn|Babaie|Babayan|Baghdiantz-McCabe|Farhad|2004|page=35}} \n\nShe played a pivotal role by her support of her nephew, heir-apparent [[Hamzeh Mirza Safavi|Hamzeh Mirza]]. According to a report by [[Iskander Beg Munshi]], Zeynab Begum stood at the head of the royal harem during the frantic civil war that had engulfed the empire in the late 1580s, amidst the [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1578-1590)|Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578\u20131590]].{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}} In the period after Hamzeh Mirza's assassination in late 1586, she was assisted by her personal [[vizier]], [[Mirza Lotfollah Shirazi]], who later became [[List of Safavid Grand Viziers|grand vizier]] of the entire state.{{sfn|Szuppe|2003|pages=153\u2013154}} Thereafter, she functioned as one of the most important supporters of the young prince Abbas (later known by his regnal name of [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]]; {{reign}}1588\u20131629) during the war of succession that had commenced during the last few years of King [[Mohammad Khodabanda]] ({{reign}}1578\u20131587).{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}}\n\n==Consolidation on the political theatre==\n[[File:Abbas_I_of_Persia.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Painting of Abbas I at the Chehel Sotoun palace]]\nIn the first years of Abbas's reign, Zeynab Begum continued to be a close confidant and acted, according to the Italian traveller [[Pietro Della Valle]], as his [[foster mother]].{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}} Even after these years, for as much as the first two decades of his reign, Zeynab Begum functioned as one of Abbas's \"key counselors\".{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}}{{sfn|Szuppe|2003|page=160}} She continued to be the leading [[matriarch]] in the harem, and she oversaw the upbringing of Abbas's sons. It appears that local governors and military chiefs asked her for political intervention on their behalf with Abbas I.{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}}\n\nDuring Abbas's reign, Zeynab Begum was intimately bound to the various administrative affairs of the crown (''khasseh'') sector within the Safavid bureaucracy. Between 1592\u20131593 and 1613\u20131614, she functioned as the governor of the crown sector of [[Kashan]], and had two bureaucrats who acted as her deputies.{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}} During these years, she reportedly owned several villages in the southern outskirts of the city of [[Yazd]]. This allowed her, for most of Abbas's reign, to collect the [[poll tax]] imposed on the domain's [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] community, and to keep it for herself.{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}} Thanks to these monies, she was able to build at least one [[caravanserai]] along the [[Isfahan]]-Kashan route in 1601\u20131602. A year later, she was given the post of the keeper of the seal used for all the royal decrees issued by the empire (''mohrd\u0101r-e sharaf nafadh'').{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}}\n\nIn 1605, during the [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1603-1618)|Ottoman-Safavid War of 1603\u20131618]], she advised Abbas to attack the Ottomans [[Battle of Sufiyan|at Sufian]]; this would result in one of his greatest military victories.{{sfn|Blow|2009|page=173}} She was on occasion included in the highest advisory body, the \"Council of State\"; in 1606, she was the only woman at the briefing.{{sfn|Blow|2009|page=173}}{{sfn|Szuppe|2003|page=160}} According to the Portuguese diplomat [[Antonio de Gouvea]], \"She made it very apparent that she deserved the honour\".{{sfn|Blow|2009|page=173}} Several years later, in 1611\u20131612, she stood at the head of the royal banquet given on the occasion of the arrival of Wali-Mohammad Khan, the [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] ruler of [[Urgench]], who had fled to the Safavid realm following an outbreak of civil war in [[Khwarezm]].{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}}\n\n==Downfall and pardon==\n[[File:Zeynab's will (Safavid).jpg|thumb|110px|Zeynab's [[Will and testament|will]], written in 1629]]\nIn 1613\u20131614, however, Zeynab Begum fell into disgrace. She was expelled from the harem, and all her posts were taken from her. She was subsequently banished to Qazvin, where she lived under [[house arrest]].{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}}{{sfn|Matthee|2012|pages=37, 203}} These events took place amidst several other purges of high-ranking Safavid officials and military leaders who were present at the court in [[Isfahan]]. According to historian [[Fazli Isfahani Khuzani|Fazli Khuzani]], this was the result of actions made by the leading ''[[Ijtihad#Qualifications_of_a_mujtahid|mojtahed]]'' at the Safavid court, Mir Mohammad Baqer Damad.{{sfn|Ghereghlou|2016}}\n\nZeynab Begum was allowed to re-enter the royal court around four years later.

At present, no cure for the disease is known, but medications or surgery can provide relief from the symptoms.\n\nWhile many medications treat Parkinson's, none actually reverses the effects of the disease. Furthermore, the gold-standard treatment varies with the disease state. People with Parkinson's, therefore, often must take a variety of medications to manage the disease's symptoms.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pdf.org/en/meds_treatments |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-11-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124092832/http://www.pdf.org/en/meds_treatments |archive-date=2016-11-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Several medications currently in development seek to better address motor fluctuations and nonmotor symptoms of PD.

Two phases are usually distinguished: an initial phase in which the individual with PD has already developed some disability for which he or she needs pharmacological treatment, and a second stage in which the patient develops motor complications related to levodopa usage.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\">{{cite book |chapter= Symptomatic pharmacological therapy in Parkinson\u2019s disease|editor=The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions| title=Parkinson's Disease| chapter-url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg35/evidence/full-guideline-194930029| publisher=Royal College of Physicians|location=London| year=2006| isbn= 978-1-86016-283-1|pages= 59\u2013100}} Guidance was [https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG35/documents/parkinsons-disease-review-decision2 reviewed in 2011] and no changes were made.

The start of L-DOPA treatment may be delayed by using other medications such as MAO-B inhibitors and dopamine agonists, in the hope of causing the onset of dyskinesias to be retarded.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> In the second stage, the aim is to reduce symptoms while controlling fluctuations of the response to medication. Sudden withdrawals from medication, and overuse by some patients, also must be controlled.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> When medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgical techniques such as deep brain stimulation can relieve the associated movement disorders.<ref name=\"pmid20937936\"/>\n\n===Levodopa===\n[[File:Stalevo.jpg|thumb|[[Stalevo]], a commercial preparation combining entacapone, levodopa, and carbidopa for treatment of Parkinson's disease]]\n[[File:Basal ganglia in treatment of Parkinson's.png|thumb|Circuits of the basal ganglia in treatment of Parkinson's disease \u2013 model of the effect of medication on motor symptoms: [[levodopa]], [[dopamine agonists]] and [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO-B inhibitors]] stimulate excitatory signals from the [[thalamus]] to the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] by effects on the [[striatum]], compensating for decreased dopaminergic signals from [[substantia nigra]] (seen at bottom right).]]\n\nLevodopa (or [[L-DOPA]]) has been the most widely used treatment for over 30 years.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> L-DOPA is transformed into dopamine in the dopaminergic neurons by [[Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase|dopa-decarboxylase]].<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> Since motor symptoms are produced by a lack of dopamine in the substantia nigra, the administration of L-DOPA temporarily diminishes the motor symptomatology.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/>\n\nOnly 5\u201310% of L-DOPA crosses the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]]. The remainder is often metabolised to dopamine elsewhere, causing a wide variety of side effects including [[nausea]], [[dyskinesia]]s, and stiffness.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> [[Carbidopa]] and [[benserazide]] are  peripheral [[dopa decarboxylase inhibitor]]s.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> They inhibit the metabolism of L-DOPA in the periphery, thereby increasing levodopa delivery to the central nervous system. They are generally given as combination preparations with levodopa.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> Existing preparations are [[carbidopa/levodopa]] (co-careldopa, trade names Sinemet, Pharmacopa, Atamet) and [[benserazide|benserazide/levodopa]] (co-beneldopa, trade name Madopar). Levodopa has also been related to a [[dopamine dysregulation syndrome]], which is a compulsive overuse of the medication, and punding.<ref name=\"pmid20123548\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ceravolo R, Frosini D, Rossi C, Bonuccelli U |title=Impulse control disorders in Parkinson's disease: definition, epidemiology, risk factors, neurobiology and management |journal=Parkinsonism Relat.

[[Duodopa]] is a combination of levodopa and carbidopa. Slow-release levodopa preparations have not shown an increased control of motor symptoms or motor complications when compared to immediate-release preparations.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/>\n\n[[Tolcapone]] inhibits the catechol-O-methyltransferase ([[COMT]]) enzyme, which degrades dopamine and levadopa, thereby prolonging the therapeutic effects of levodopa.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> It, alongside inhibitors of peripheral dopa decarboxylase, have been used to complement levodopa. However, due to its possible side effects such as liver failure, it is limited in its availability.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> A similar drug, [[entacapone]], has not been shown to cause significant alterations of liver function and maintains adequate inhibition of COMT over time.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> Entacapone is available for treatment alone (COMTan) or combined with carbidopa and levodopa ([[Stalevo]]).<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/>\n\nLevodopa results in a reduction in the endogenous formation of L-DOPA, and eventually becomes counterproductive. Levodopa preparations lead in the long term to the development of motor complications characterized by involuntary movements called dyskinesias and fluctuations in the response to medication.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/>  When this occurs, PD patients change rapidly from stages with good response to medication and few symptoms (\"on\" state) to phases with no response to medication and important motor symptoms (\"off\" state).<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> For this reason, levodopa doses are kept as low as possible while maintaining functionality.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> Delaying the initiation of dopatherapy, using instead alternatives for some time, is also common practice.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> A former strategy to reduce motor complications was to withdraw patients from L-DOPA for some time. It is discouraged now since it can bring dangerous side effects such as [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]].<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> Most people eventually need levodopa and later develop motor complications.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/>\n\nThe on-off phenomenon is an almost invariable consequence of sustained levodopa treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease. Phases of immobility and incapacity associated with depression alternate with jubilant thaws. Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors are involved in its pathogenesis, but evidence is presented to indicate the importance of levodopa handling has been underestimated and progressive reduction in the storage capacity of surviving nigrostriatal dopamine terminals is not a critical factor. Redistribution of levodopa dosage which may mean smaller, more frequent doses, or larger less frequent increments, may be helpful in controlling oscillations in some patients. Dietary protein restriction and the use of selegiline hydrochloride and bromocriptine may also temporarily improve motor fluctuations. New approaches to management include the use of subcutaneous [[apomorphine]], controlled-release preparations of levodopa with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor and the continuous intraduodenal administration of levodopa.\n\nIn animal models it was shown that the intake of Adenosine receptor antagonists together with Levodopa can amplify its therapeutic effects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morelli|first=Micaela|last2=Blandini|first2=Fabio|last3=Simola|first3=Nicola|last4=Hauser|first4=Robert A.|date=2012|title=A2AReceptor Antagonism and Dyskinesia in Parkinson's Disease|journal=Parkinson's Disease|volume=2012|pages=489853|doi=10.1155/2012/489853|issn=2090-8083|pmc=3382949|pmid=22754707}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Armentero|first=Marie Therese|last2=Pinna|first2=Annalisa|last3=Ferr\u00e9|first3=Sergi|last4=Lanciego|first4=Jos\u00e9 Luis|last5=M\u00fcller|first5=Christa E.|last6=Franco|first6=Rafael|date=December 2011|title=Past, present and future of A2A adenosine receptor antagonists in the therapy of Parkinson's disease|journal=Pharmacology & Therapeutics|volume=132|issue=3|pages=280\u2013299|doi=10.1016/j.pharmthera.2011.07.004|issn=0163-7258|pmc=3205226|pmid=21810444}}</ref>\n\n===Dopamine agonists===\n[[Dopamine agonist]]s in the brain have a similar effect to levodopa since they bind to dopaminergic postsynaptic receptors.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> Dopamine agonists were initially used for patients experiencing on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias as a complementary therapy to levodopa, but they are now mainly used on their own as an initial therapy for motor symptoms with the aim of delaying motor complications.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Goldenberg MM |title=Medical management of Parkinson's disease |journal=P & T |volume=33 |issue=10 |pages=590\u2013606 |date=October 2008 |pmid=19750042 |pmc=2730785}}</ref> When used in late PD, they are useful at reducing the off periods.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> Dopamine agonists include [[bromocriptine]], [[pergolide]], [[pramipexole]], [[ropinirole]], [[piribedil]], [[cabergoline]], [[apomorphine]], and [[lisuride]].\n\nAgonists produce significant, although mild, side effects including [[somnolence]], [[hallucination]]s, [[insomnia]], [[nausea]], and [[constipation]].<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> Sometimes, side effects appear even at the minimal clinically efficacious dose, leading the physician to search for a different agonist or kind of drug.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> When compared with levodopa, while they delay motor complications, they control worse symptoms.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> Nevertheless, they are usually effective enough to manage symptoms in the initial years.<ref name=\"pmid15172778\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Samii A, Nutt JG, Ransom BR |title=Parkinson's disease |journal=Lancet |volume=363 |issue=9423 |pages=1783\u201393 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15172778 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16305-8 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1259791 }}</ref> They are also more expensive.<ref name=\"pmid15172778\"/> Dyskinesias with dopamine agonists are rare in younger patients, but along other side effects, more common in older patients.<ref name=\"pmid15172778\"/> All this has led to agonists being the preferential initial treatment for the former as opposed to levodopa in the latter.<ref name=\"pmid15172778\"/> Agonists at higher doses have also been related to a wide variety of impulse-control disorders.<ref name=\"pmid20123548\"/>\n\n[[Apomorphine]], which is a dopamine agonist not orally administered, may be used to reduce off periods and dyskinesia in late PD.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> Since secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are not rare, patients under apomorphine treatment should be closely monitored.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> Apomorphine can be administered by subcutaneous injection using a small pump which is carried by the patient. A low dose is automatically administered throughout the day, reducing the fluctuations of motor symptoms by providing a steady dose of dopaminergic stimulation. After an initial \"apomorphine challenge\" in hospital to test its effectiveness and brief patient and [[primary caregiver]] (often a spouse or partner), the latter of whom takes over maintenance of the pump. The injection site must be changed daily and rotated around the body to avoid the formation of [[Nodule (medicine)|nodules]]. Apomorphine is also available in a more acute dose as an [[autoinjector]] pen for emergency doses such as after a fall or first thing in the morning. Nausea and vomiting are common, and may require [[domperidone]] (an antiemetic).\n\nIn a study evaluating the efficacy of dopamine agonists compared to levodopa, the results showed patients who took dopamine agonists were less likely to develop dyskinesia, dystonia, and motor fluctuations, although were more likely to discontinue therapy due to negative side effects such as nausea, edema, constipation, etc.\n\n===MAO-B inhibitors===\n[[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s ([[selegiline]] and [[rasagiline]]) increase the level of dopamine in the basal ganglia by blocking its metabolization. They inhibit monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) which breaks down dopamine secreted by the dopaminergic neurons. Therefore, reducing MAO-B results in higher quantities of L-DOPA in the striatum.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> Similarly to dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors improve motor symptoms and delay the need of taking levodopa when used as monotherapy in the first stages of the disease, but produce more adverse effects and are less effective than levodopa. Evidence on their efficacy in the advanced stage is reduced, although it points towards them being useful to reduce fluctuations between on and off periods.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> Although an initial study indicated selegiline in combination with levodopa increased the risk of death, this has been later disproven.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/>\n\nMetabolites of selegiline include L-amphetamine and L-methamphetamine (not to be confused with the more potent dextrorotary isomers).  This might result in side effects such as insomnia. Another side effect of the combination can be [[stomatitis]]. Unlike other nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tyramine-containing foods do not cause a hypertensive crisis.\n\n===Other drugs===\nSome evidence indicates other drugs such as [[amantadine]] and [[anticholinergic]]s may be useful as treatment of motor symptoms in early and late PD, but since the quality of evidence on efficacy is reduced, they are not first-choice treatments.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> In addition to motor symptoms, PD is accompanied by a range of different symptoms.

The three different mechanisms of surgical response for PD are: [[ablation|ablative surgery]], (the irreversible burning or freezing of brain [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]), stimulation surgery or deep brain stimulation (DBS), and transplantation or restorative surgery.<ref>[http://www.neurologychannel.com/parkinsonsdisease/surgery.shtml Parkinson's disease surgery] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330162601/http://www.neurologychannel.com/parkinsonsdisease/surgery.shtml |date=2010-03-30 }} neurology Channel. Retrieved on 2010-02-02</ref>\n\nTarget areas for DBS or lesions include the [[thalamus]], the [[globus pallidus]] (the lesion technique being called [[pallidotomy]]), or the [[subthalamic nucleus]].<ref name=\"Nice-surgery\"/>\n\n===Neuroablative lesion surgery===\nNeuroablative lesion surgery locates and destroys, by heat, the parts of the brain associated with producing Parkinsonian [[neurology|neurological]] symptoms. The procedures generally involve a thalamotomy and/or pallidotomy.  A thalamotomy is the destruction of a part of the thalamus, in particular the ventralis intermedius, to suppress tremor in 80-90% of patients. If rigidity and akinesia are apparent, the subthalamis nucleus is then the site of ablation.\n\nA pallidotomy involves the destruction of the globus pallidus, in particular the globus pallidus interna, in patients with Parkinson's who suffer from rigidity and akinesia.\n\nBecause it is difficult to accurately measure the amount of tissue to be destroyed, [[tremor]]s not uncommonly  persist through multiple courses of surgery, since tissue is irreversibly damaged and removed and testing smaller areas of tissue is safer to prevent serious complications, such as a [[stroke]] or [[paralysis]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}. This method has been generally replaced by deep brain surgery.\n\n===Deep brain stimulation===\n[[Deep brain stimulation]] (DBS) is presently the most used method of surgical treatment because it does not destroy brain tissue, it is reversible, and it can be tailored to individuals at their particular stage of disease. DBS employs three hardware components: a [[neurostimulator]], also called an implanted pulse generator (IPG), which generates electrical impulses used to modulate neural activity, a lead wire which directs the impulses to a number of metallic [[electrode]]s towards the tip of the lead near the stimulation target, and an extension wire that connects the lead to the IPG. The IPG, which is battery-powered and encased in titanium, is traditionally implanted under the collarbone, and is connected by the subcutaneous extension to the lead, which extends from outside the skull under the scalp down into the brain to the target of stimulation. The IPG, or the entire three-component system, are sometimes referred to as a [[neurostimulator|brain pacemaker]], due to the precedence and renown of [[Artificial pacemaker|cardiac pacemakers]] and similarities in the components of both types of systems.\n\nThe preoperative targeting of proper implantation sites can be accomplished by the indirect and direct methods. The indirect method uses computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ventriculography to locate the anterior and posterior commissures and then employs predetermined coordinates and distances from the intercommissural line to define the target area. Subsequent histologically defined atlas maps can also be used to verify the target area. The direct method provides visualization and targeting of deep nuclei by applying stereotactic preoperative MRI, which unlike the indirect method, takes into account the anatomic variation of the nuclei\u2019s size, position, and functional segregation amongst individuals.<ref>Nolte, 2012</ref>\n\nElectrophysial functional mapping, a tool used in both methods to verify the target nuclei, has come under scrutiny due to its associated risks of hemorrhages, [[dysarthria]] or tetanic contractions. Recently, susceptibility-weighted imaging, a type of MRI, has shown incredible power in its ability to distinguish these deep brain nuclei and is being used in DBS to reduce the overuse of EFM.<ref>Abosch, 2010</ref>\n\nDBS is recommended to PD patients without important neuropsychiatric [[contraindication]]s who suffer motor fluctuations and tremor badly controlled by medication, or to those who are intolerant to medication.<ref name=\"pmid20937936\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Bronstein JM, Tagliati M, Alterman RL, etal |title=Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson Disease: An Expert Consensus and Review of Key Issues |journal=Arch Neurol |volume= 68|issue= 2|pages= 165\u201365|date=October 2010 |pmid=20937936 |doi=10.1001/archneurol.2010.260 |url=|pmc=4523130}}</ref>\n\nDBS is effective in suppressing symptoms of PD, especially tremor.

The start of L-DOPA treatment may be delayed by using other medications such as MAO-B inhibitors and dopamine agonists, in the hope of causing the onset of dyskinesias to be retarded.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> In the second stage, the aim is to reduce symptoms while controlling fluctuations of the response to medication. Sudden withdrawals from medication, and overuse by some patients, also must be controlled.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> When medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgical techniques such as deep brain stimulation can relieve the associated movement disorders.<ref name=\"pmid20937936\"/>\n\n===Levodopa===\n[[File:Stalevo.jpg|thumb|[[Stalevo]], a commercial preparation combining entacapone, levodopa, and carbidopa for treatment of Parkinson's disease]]\n[[File:Basal ganglia in treatment of Parkinson's.png|thumb|Circuits of the basal ganglia in treatment of Parkinson's disease \u2013 model of the effect of medication on motor symptoms: [[levodopa]], [[dopamine agonists]] and [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO-B inhibitors]] stimulate excitatory signals from the [[thalamus]] to the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] by effects on the [[striatum]], compensating for decreased dopaminergic signals from [[substantia nigra]] (seen at bottom right).]]\n\nLevodopa (or [[L-DOPA]]) has been the most widely used treatment for over 30 years.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> L-DOPA is transformed into dopamine in the dopaminergic neurons by [[Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase|dopa-decarboxylase]].<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> Since motor symptoms are produced by a lack of dopamine in the substantia nigra, the administration of L-DOPA temporarily diminishes the motor symptomatology.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/>\n\nOnly 5\u201310% of L-DOPA crosses the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]].

Slow-release levodopa preparations have not shown an increased control of motor symptoms or motor complications when compared to immediate-release preparations.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/>\n\n[[Tolcapone]] inhibits the catechol-O-methyltransferase ([[COMT]]) enzyme, which degrades dopamine and levadopa, thereby prolonging the therapeutic effects of levodopa.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> It, alongside inhibitors of peripheral dopa decarboxylase, have been used to complement levodopa. However, due to its possible side effects such as liver failure, it is limited in its availability.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> A similar drug, [[entacapone]], has not been shown to cause significant alterations of liver function and maintains adequate inhibition of COMT over time.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> Entacapone is available for treatment alone (COMTan) or combined with carbidopa and levodopa ([[Stalevo]]).<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/>\n\nLevodopa results in a reduction in the endogenous formation of L-DOPA, and eventually becomes counterproductive. Levodopa preparations lead in the long term to the development of motor complications characterized by involuntary movements called dyskinesias and fluctuations in the response to medication.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/>  When this occurs, PD patients change rapidly from stages with good response to medication and few symptoms (\"on\" state) to phases with no response to medication and important motor symptoms (\"off\" state).<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> For this reason, levodopa doses are kept as low as possible while maintaining functionality.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> Delaying the initiation of dopatherapy, using instead alternatives for some time, is also common practice.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> A former strategy to reduce motor complications was to withdraw patients from L-DOPA for some time. It is discouraged now since it can bring dangerous side effects such as [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]].<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> Most people eventually need levodopa and later develop motor complications.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/>\n\nThe on-off phenomenon is an almost invariable consequence of sustained levodopa treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease. Phases of immobility and incapacity associated with depression alternate with jubilant thaws. Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors are involved in its pathogenesis, but evidence is presented to indicate the importance of levodopa handling has been underestimated and progressive reduction in the storage capacity of surviving nigrostriatal dopamine terminals is not a critical factor. Redistribution of levodopa dosage which may mean smaller, more frequent doses, or larger less frequent increments, may be helpful in controlling oscillations in some patients. Dietary protein restriction and the use of selegiline hydrochloride and bromocriptine may also temporarily improve motor fluctuations. New approaches to management include the use of subcutaneous [[apomorphine]], controlled-release preparations of levodopa with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor and the continuous intraduodenal administration of levodopa.\n\nIn animal models it was shown that the intake of Adenosine receptor antagonists together with Levodopa can amplify its therapeutic effects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morelli|first=Micaela|last2=Blandini|first2=Fabio|last3=Simola|first3=Nicola|last4=Hauser|first4=Robert A.|date=2012|title=A2AReceptor Antagonism and Dyskinesia in Parkinson's Disease|journal=Parkinson's Disease|volume=2012|pages=489853|doi=10.1155/2012/489853|issn=2090-8083|pmc=3382949|pmid=22754707}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Armentero|first=Marie Therese|last2=Pinna|first2=Annalisa|last3=Ferr\u00e9|first3=Sergi|last4=Lanciego|first4=Jos\u00e9 Luis|last5=M\u00fcller|first5=Christa E.|last6=Franco|first6=Rafael|date=December 2011|title=Past, present and future of A2A adenosine receptor antagonists in the therapy of Parkinson's disease|journal=Pharmacology & Therapeutics|volume=132|issue=3|pages=280\u2013299|doi=10.1016/j.pharmthera.2011.07.004|issn=0163-7258|pmc=3205226|pmid=21810444}}</ref>\n\n===Dopamine agonists===\n[[Dopamine agonist]]s in the brain have a similar effect to levodopa since they bind to dopaminergic postsynaptic receptors.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> Dopamine agonists were initially used for patients experiencing on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias as a complementary therapy to levodopa, but they are now mainly used on their own as an initial therapy for motor symptoms with the aim of delaying motor complications.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Goldenberg MM |title=Medical management of Parkinson's disease |journal=P & T |volume=33 |issue=10 |pages=590\u2013606 |date=October 2008 |pmid=19750042 |pmc=2730785}}</ref> When used in late PD, they are useful at reducing the off periods.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> Dopamine agonists include [[bromocriptine]], [[pergolide]], [[pramipexole]], [[ropinirole]], [[piribedil]], [[cabergoline]], [[apomorphine]], and [[lisuride]].\n\nAgonists produce significant, although mild, side effects including [[somnolence]], [[hallucination]]s, [[insomnia]], [[nausea]], and [[constipation]].<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> Sometimes, side effects appear even at the minimal clinically efficacious dose, leading the physician to search for a different agonist or kind of drug.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> When compared with levodopa, while they delay motor complications, they control worse symptoms.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> Nevertheless, they are usually effective enough to manage symptoms in the initial years.<ref name=\"pmid15172778\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Samii A, Nutt JG, Ransom BR |title=Parkinson's disease |journal=Lancet |volume=363 |issue=9423 |pages=1783\u201393 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15172778 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16305-8 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1259791 }}</ref> They are also more expensive.<ref name=\"pmid15172778\"/> Dyskinesias with dopamine agonists are rare in younger patients, but along other side effects, more common in older patients.<ref name=\"pmid15172778\"/> All this has led to agonists being the preferential initial treatment for the former as opposed to levodopa in the latter.<ref name=\"pmid15172778\"/> Agonists at higher doses have also been related to a wide variety of impulse-control disorders.<ref name=\"pmid20123548\"/>\n\n[[Apomorphine]], which is a dopamine agonist not orally administered, may be used to reduce off periods and dyskinesia in late PD.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> Since secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are not rare, patients under apomorphine treatment should be closely monitored.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> Apomorphine can be administered by subcutaneous injection using a small pump which is carried by the patient.

After an initial \"apomorphine challenge\" in hospital to test its effectiveness and brief patient and [[primary caregiver]] (often a spouse or partner), the latter of whom takes over maintenance of the pump. The injection site must be changed daily and rotated around the body to avoid the formation of [[Nodule (medicine)|nodules]]. Apomorphine is also available in a more acute dose as an [[autoinjector]] pen for emergency doses such as after a fall or first thing in the morning. Nausea and vomiting are common, and may require [[domperidone]] (an antiemetic).\n\nIn a study evaluating the efficacy of dopamine agonists compared to levodopa, the results showed patients who took dopamine agonists were less likely to develop dyskinesia, dystonia, and motor fluctuations, although were more likely to discontinue therapy due to negative side effects such as nausea, edema, constipation, etc.\n\n===MAO-B inhibitors===\n[[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s ([[selegiline]] and [[rasagiline]]) increase the level of dopamine in the basal ganglia by blocking its metabolization. They inhibit monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) which breaks down dopamine secreted by the dopaminergic neurons. Therefore, reducing MAO-B results in higher quantities of L-DOPA in the striatum.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> Similarly to dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors improve motor symptoms and delay the need of taking levodopa when used as monotherapy in the first stages of the disease, but produce more adverse effects and are less effective than levodopa. Evidence on their efficacy in the advanced stage is reduced, although it points towards them being useful to reduce fluctuations between on and off periods.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> Although an initial study indicated selegiline in combination with levodopa increased the risk of death, this has been later disproven.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/>\n\nMetabolites of selegiline include L-amphetamine and L-methamphetamine (not to be confused with the more potent dextrorotary isomers).  This might result in side effects such as insomnia. Another side effect of the combination can be [[stomatitis]]. Unlike other nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tyramine-containing foods do not cause a hypertensive crisis.\n\n===Other drugs===\nSome evidence indicates other drugs such as [[amantadine]] and [[anticholinergic]]s may be useful as treatment of motor symptoms in early and late PD, but since the quality of evidence on efficacy is reduced, they are not first-choice treatments.<ref name=\"Nice-pharma\"/> In addition to motor symptoms, PD is accompanied by a range of different symptoms.

The three different mechanisms of surgical response for PD are: [[ablation|ablative surgery]], (the irreversible burning or freezing of brain [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]), stimulation surgery or deep brain stimulation (DBS), and transplantation or restorative surgery.<ref>[http://www.neurologychannel.com/parkinsonsdisease/surgery.shtml Parkinson's disease surgery] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330162601/http://www.neurologychannel.com/parkinsonsdisease/surgery.shtml |date=2010-03-30 }} neurology Channel. Retrieved on 2010-02-02</ref>\n\nTarget areas for DBS or lesions include the [[thalamus]], the [[globus pallidus]] (the lesion technique being called [[pallidotomy]]), or the [[subthalamic nucleus]].<ref name=\"Nice-surgery\"/>\n\n===Neuroablative lesion surgery===\nNeuroablative lesion surgery locates and destroys, by heat, the parts of the brain associated with producing Parkinsonian [[neurology|neurological]] symptoms. The procedures generally involve a thalamotomy and/or pallidotomy.  A thalamotomy is the destruction of a part of the thalamus, in particular the ventralis intermedius, to suppress tremor in 80-90% of patients. If rigidity and akinesia are apparent, the subthalamis nucleus is then the site of ablation.\n\nA pallidotomy involves the destruction of the globus pallidus, in particular the globus pallidus interna, in patients with Parkinson's who suffer from rigidity and akinesia.\n\nBecause it is difficult to accurately measure the amount of tissue to be destroyed, [[tremor]]s not uncommonly  persist through multiple courses of surgery, since tissue is irreversibly damaged and removed and testing smaller areas of tissue is safer to prevent serious complications, such as a [[stroke]] or [[paralysis]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}. This method has been generally replaced by deep brain surgery.\n\n===Deep brain stimulation===\n[[Deep brain stimulation]] (DBS) is presently the most used method of surgical treatment because it does not destroy brain tissue, it is reversible, and it can be tailored to individuals at their particular stage of disease. DBS employs three hardware components: a [[neurostimulator]], also called an implanted pulse generator (IPG), which generates electrical impulses used to modulate neural activity, a lead wire which directs the impulses to a number of metallic [[electrode]]s towards the tip of the lead near the stimulation target, and an extension wire that connects the lead to the IPG. The IPG, which is battery-powered and encased in titanium, is traditionally implanted under the collarbone, and is connected by the subcutaneous extension to the lead, which extends from outside the skull under the scalp down into the brain to the target of stimulation. The IPG, or the entire three-component system, are sometimes referred to as a [[neurostimulator|brain pacemaker]], due to the precedence and renown of [[Artificial pacemaker|cardiac pacemakers]] and similarities in the components of both types of systems.\n\nThe preoperative targeting of proper implantation sites can be accomplished by the indirect and direct methods. The indirect method uses computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ventriculography to locate the anterior and posterior commissures and then employs predetermined coordinates and distances from the intercommissural line to define the target area. Subsequent histologically defined atlas maps can also be used to verify the target area. The direct method provides visualization and targeting of deep nuclei by applying stereotactic preoperative MRI, which unlike the indirect method, takes into account the anatomic variation of the nuclei\u2019s size, position, and functional segregation amongst individuals.<ref>Nolte, 2012</ref>\n\nElectrophysial functional mapping, a tool used in both methods to verify the target nuclei, has come under scrutiny due to its associated risks of hemorrhages, [[dysarthria]] or tetanic contractions. Recently, susceptibility-weighted imaging, a type of MRI, has shown incredible power in its ability to distinguish these deep brain nuclei and is being used in DBS to reduce the overuse of EFM.<ref>Abosch, 2010</ref>\n\nDBS is recommended to PD patients without important neuropsychiatric [[contraindication]]s who suffer motor fluctuations and tremor badly controlled by medication, or to those who are intolerant to medication.<ref name=\"pmid20937936\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Bronstein JM, Tagliati M, Alterman RL, etal |title=Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson Disease: An Expert Consensus and Review of Key Issues |journal=Arch Neurol |volume= 68|issue= 2|pages= 165\u201365|date=October 2010 |pmid=20937936 |doi=10.1001/archneurol.2010.260 |url=|pmc=4523130}}</ref>\n\nDBS is effective in suppressing symptoms of PD, especially tremor.

Currently, no proven neuroprotective agents or treatments are available for PD. While still theoretical, neuroprotective therapy is based on the idea that certain [[neuron]]s that produce [[dopamine]] and are susceptible to premature [[Neurodegeneration|degeneration]] and cell death can be protected by the introduction of neuroprotective [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]]. This protection can occur before any symptoms manifest based on genetic risk, and also during early- or late-stage PD when other treatments have ceased their impact due to the progression of the disease. Accordingly, neuroprotective therapy seeks to delay the introduction of levodopa.\n\nSeveral molecules have been proposed as potential treatments.<ref name=\"pmid20495568\"/> However, none of them has been conclusively demonstrated to reduce degeneration.<ref name=\"pmid20495568\"/> Agents currently under investigation include [[apoptosis|antiapoptotics]] ([[omigapil]], [[CEP-1347]]), [[glutamate|antiglutamatergics]], [[monoamine oxidase]] inhibitors ([[selegiline]], [[rasagiline]]), [[mitochondrial|promitochondrials]] ([[coenzyme Q10]], [[creatine]]), [[calcium channel blocker]]s ([[isradipine]]) and [[growth factor]]s ([[GDNF]]).<ref name=\"pmid20495568\"/> Preclinical research also targets [[alpha-synuclein]].<ref name=Dimond>{{citation |url=http://www.genengnews.com/analysis-and-insight/no-new-parkinson-disease-drug-expected-anytime-soon/77899336/ |title=No New Parkinson Disease Drug Expected Anytime Soon |author=Dimond PF |date=2010-08-16|work=GEN news highlights |publisher=GEN-Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News|accessdate=2010-10-25 }}</ref>\n\n====Selegiline====\nSelegiline is in a group of medications called monoamine oxidase type B ([[Monoamine oxidase B|MAO-B]]) [[Reaction inhibitor|inhibitors]].<ref>[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a697046.html Selegiline Information] MedLine Plus.
