The race has been run every year since its inception with the exception of 1936, where the race was not run due to [[Great Depression in France#From depression to war|worker strikes]], and 1940 to 1948, due to [[World War II]].  Records for wins are also listed. Lower class wins are not included.\n\nAfter the first 44 events had two drivers per winning entry, the winning entry used three drivers in 1977, which became the winning norm from 1985 onwards. With multiple drivers per winning entry, tempered by some drivers winning more than once, a total of 136 different drivers have won in the [[2019 24 Hours of Le Mans|86 runnings]] of the race.\n\n==Winners==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

The race has been run every year since its inception with the exception of 1936, where the race was not run due to [[Great Depression in France#From depression to war|worker strikes]], and 1940 to 1948, due to [[World War II]].  Records for wins are also listed. Lower class wins are not included.\n\nAfter the first 44 events had two drivers per winning entry, the winning entry used three drivers in 1977, which became the winning norm from 1985 onwards. With multiple drivers per winning entry, tempered by some drivers winning more than once, a total of 136 different drivers have won in the [[2019 24 Hours of Le Mans|86 runnings]] of the race.\n\n==Winners==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

It was built in 1922 by James Sorenson and is an example of [[American Craftsman]] [[Bungalow]] architecture. The interior displays artistic heights of the American [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] style. It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP) on March 9, 1995.<ref name=nrhpdoc/>\n\n==Setting==\nThe City of Bothell is on the border of [[King County, Washington|King]] and [[Snohomish County, Washington|Snohomish]] counties in western [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state. The [[Sammamish River]] crosses the south part of the city as it flows from [[Lake Sammamish]] on the southeast to [[Lake Washington]] to the northeast. Homes built on Bothell between 1905 and 1925 were suburban with post\u2013[[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] and  [[American Craftsman|Craftsman]] styles.<ref name=nrhpdoc2/> The Sorenson House was built in 1922 on a {{convert|4|acre|adj=on}} parcel of land given to James Sorenson by his father in law Alfred Pearson. Pearson was a local logger and contemporary of the town's founder David Bothell.<ref name=nrhpdoc/><ref name=kehoe/> The property the house occupied when listed on the NRHP was the remaining {{convert|0.729|acre}}.<ref name=nrhpdoc/> The house was moved about {{convert|600|ft}} north to a single\u2013family lot in 2015.<ref name=kehoe/>\n\nThe original site was atop a steep north facing slope. The [[facade]] faced west and approach in 1994 was from the east, a route which passed Pearson's own home. It is unclear if the original approach was from this direction and the house was just oriented toward the best views or if there was a westerly approach leading to the facade and entrance.<ref name=nrhpdoc/>\n\n==James Sorenson==\nJames \"Jim\" Sorensen, a [[Denmark|Danish]] immigrant, trained in [[shipbuilding]] as a carpenter before coming to America. In 1910 he married Mary Pearson and began a business partnership with William Schrotke in [[woodworking]], [[Cabinetry|cabinet making]] and [[General contractor|contracting]]. He built many Craftsman style homes popular in [[architectural pattern book]]s and enjoyed a good reputation. None of his other extant buildings display the degree of style and scale as his own home. In describing the home the NRHP nomination reads, \"His talent and success at his trade are <u>most</u> evident in his beautifully executed home.\" and regarding the interior, \"Mr. Sorenson, the builder, seeming used all his artistry in his own home to create a truly elegant setting.\" Sorenson died of tuberculosis in 1938.<ref name=nrhpdoc/>\n\n==Building==\nThe <small>{{frac|1|1|2}}</small> story home has an irregular [[floor plan]]. It is complex but sturdy and orderly. Well ornamented with features like triangular knee braces and decoratively shaped barge boards covering the rafter ends over wide open eaves on the gable ends. With its bold geometric lines and smooth curves there is no suggestion of [[Gingerbread house (architecture)|gingerbread]].

It was built in 1922 by James Sorenson and is an example of [[American Craftsman]] [[Bungalow]] architecture. The interior displays artistic heights of the American [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] style. It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP) on March 9, 1995.<ref name=nrhpdoc/>\n\n==Setting==\nThe City of Bothell is on the border of [[King County, Washington|King]] and [[Snohomish County, Washington|Snohomish]] counties in western [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state. The [[Sammamish River]] crosses the south part of the city as it flows from [[Lake Sammamish]] on the southeast to [[Lake Washington]] to the northeast. Homes built on Bothell between 1905 and 1925 were suburban with post\u2013[[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] and  [[American Craftsman|Craftsman]] styles.<ref name=nrhpdoc2/> The Sorenson House was built in 1922 on a {{convert|4|acre|adj=on}} parcel of land given to James Sorenson by his father in law Alfred Pearson. Pearson was a local logger and contemporary of the town's founder David Bothell.<ref name=nrhpdoc/><ref name=kehoe/> The property the house occupied when listed on the NRHP was the remaining {{convert|0.729|acre}}.<ref name=nrhpdoc/> The house was moved about {{convert|600|ft}} north to a single\u2013family lot in 2015.<ref name=kehoe/>\n\nThe original site was atop a steep north facing slope. The [[facade]] faced west and approach in 1994 was from the east, a route which passed Pearson's own home. It is unclear if the original approach was from this direction and the house was just oriented toward the best views or if there was a westerly approach leading to the facade and entrance.<ref name=nrhpdoc/>\n\n==James Sorenson==\nJames \"Jim\" Sorensen, a [[Denmark|Danish]] immigrant, trained in [[shipbuilding]] as a carpenter before coming to America. In 1910 he married Mary Pearson and began a business partnership with William Schrotke in [[woodworking]], [[Cabinetry|cabinet making]] and [[General contractor|contracting]]. He built many Craftsman style homes popular in [[architectural pattern book]]s and enjoyed a good reputation. None of his other extant buildings display the degree of style and scale as his own home. In describing the home the NRHP nomination reads, \"His talent and success at his trade are <u>most</u> evident in his beautifully executed home.\" and regarding the interior, \"Mr. Sorenson, the builder, seeming used all his artistry in his own home to create a truly elegant setting.\" Sorenson died of tuberculosis in 1938.<ref name=nrhpdoc/>\n\n==Building==\nThe <small>{{frac|1|1|2}}</small> story home has an irregular [[floor plan]]. It is complex but sturdy and orderly. Well ornamented with features like triangular knee braces and decoratively shaped barge boards covering the rafter ends over wide open eaves on the gable ends. With it's bold geometric lines and smooth curves there is no suggestion of [[Gingerbread house (architecture)|gingerbread]]. A multiplanar roof breaks the mass into comfortable orderly elements tied together with scale and balance. The low pitched [[gable]]s on the facade with two symmetrical gabled projecting bays maintain a modest scale while the cross gabled corner porch extending north and wrapping east gives the building substantial mass and presence. The battered brick [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] rising to halfway between porch floor and ceiling from ground level supporting tapered square wood columns add to the weight of the house and pilasters at the height of porch rail of the same board reinforce the Craftsman styling. \n<ref name=nrhpdoc/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[National Register of Historic Places listings in King County, Washington]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2013a|refnum=95000187|name=Sorenson House|dateform=dmy}}</ref>\n<ref name=nrhpdoc>{{citation|last=Grace|first=Barbara J.|date= 9 March 1995 |title= National Register of Historic Places Inventory \u2014 Nomination Form: Sorenson House |url= {{NRHP url|id=95000187}} |publisher= National Park Service}} With {{NRHP url|id=95000187|photos=y|title=20 photos}} from 1994.</ref>\n<ref name=nris2>{{NRISref|version=2013a|refnum=64500695 |name=Bothell MPS |dateform=dmy}}</ref>\n<ref name=nrhpdoc2>{{citation|url={{NRHP url|id=64500695}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Multiple Property Documentation Form: Historic Resources of Bothell, Washington |publisher=National Park Service|last1= Garwood |first1= Robert D. |last2= Knapp |first2= Michael T. |editor-last= Garfield |editor-first= L.|date= 27 Aug 1990 |accessdate= 6 Jan 2020 |postscript=. }}</ref>\n<ref name=kehoe>{{cite news|last=Keho|first=Sarah|date=2015|title=Old historic Bothell building moves down the road|url=http://www.bothell-reporter.com/news/old-historic-bothell-building-moves-down-the-road/?amp |work=Bothell\u2013Kenmore Reporter |publisher= Sound Publishing |accessdate=6 Jan 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Sorenson House (Bothell, Washington)|the Sorenson House}}\n\n{{National Register of Historic Places in Washington}}\n{{Portal bar|Architecture|National Register of Historic Places|United States}}\n\n[[Category:1922 establishments in Washington (state)]]\n[[Category:Bungalow architecture in Washington (state)]]\n[[Category:Houses completed in 1922]]\n[[Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Washington (state)]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in King County, Washington]]\n[[Category:Houses in King County, Washington]]\n", "name_user": "Neils51", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBuilding:spelling - it's->its", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorenson_House"}

Gallery, make a stronger showing than have her previous exhibits. In her case a fine sense of the episodic has not interfered with the capacity to build a firm, substantial picture. On the contrary, the two have grown together. Thus we can point to the 'Old Man' as a splendid glimpse of life on the street and an outstanding example of solid figure construction. The brush runs more fluently in the conversation between 'Neighbors,' which seems as natural as a casual glance but is probably the most carefully pondered composition in the lot. Of the three excellent winter scenes, 'Heavy Snowfall' is most vigorous and best in harmony. While the scenes of war and persecution are clearly done with the full strength of conviction, they are not as successful as the local genre. 'Spanish Mothers' is the outstanding canvas in this group. }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"New York Times Jan 1939\">{{cite news |title=A Reviewer's Notebook: Final Week of the Year Brings Forward Papers by Many Water-Colorists  |author=Howard Devree |work=New York Times |location= |date=1939-01-01 |page=104 |quote=Cleaner and brighter color than heretofore and good stanch design characterize the paintings by Lena Gurr, currently on view at the A.C.A.

Gallery, make a stronger showing than have her previous exhibits. In her case a fine sense of the episodic has not interfered with the capacity to build a firm, substantial picture. On the contrary, the two have grown together. Thus we can point to the 'Old Man' as a splendid glimpse of life on the street and an outstanding example of solid figure construction. The brush runs more fluently in the conversation between 'Neighbors,' which seems as natural as a casual glance but is probably the most carefully pondered composition in the lot. Of the three excellent winter scenes, 'Heavy Snowfall' is most vigorous and best in harmony. While the scenes of war and persecution are clearly done with the full strength of conviction, they are not as successful as the local genre. 'Spanish Mothers' is the outstanding canvas in this group. }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"New York Times Jan 1939\">{{cite news |title=A Reviewer's Notebook: Final Week of the Year Brings Forward Papers by Many Water-Colorists  |author=Howard Devree |work=New York Times |location= |date=1939-01-01 |page=104 |quote=Cleaner and brighter color than heretofore and good stanch design characterize the paintings by Lena Gurr, currently on view at the A.C.A.

She also sees and portrays the tragedy of the slums or the war-stricken humble folk and a ready sympathy lies behind her work. She can suggest by a small group and their nondescript possessions the whole of a Summer beach without crowding it with writhing figures. Miss Gurr's work is sound and well considered, with a folksy quality that is delightful. }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"New York Times Jan 1 1939\">{{cite news |title=Events Here and There  |author= |work=New York Times |location= |date=1939-01-01 |page=104 |quote= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"New York Post May 1939\">{{cite news |title=Art of America Today on Display at World's Fair |author=Jerome Klein |work=New York Post |location= |date=1939-05-05 |page=3 |quote= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"New York Times Mar 1940\">{{cite news |title=In the Field of Prints  |author= |work=New York Times |location= |date=1940-03-24 |page=115 |quote= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"New York Times Oct 1940\">{{cite news |title=A Reviewer's Notebook: Brief Comment on Some Recently Opened Shows\u2014Old Masters and Contemporaries  |author=Howard Devree |work=New York Times |location= |date=1940-10-27 |page=138 |quote= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"New York Times Feb 1941\">{{cite news |title=Here, There, Elsewhere  |author= |work=New York Times |location= |date=1941-02-02 |page=X10 |quote= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"New York Sun Dec 1942\">{{cite news |title=Art Teachers Show Work in Exhibition  |author= |work=New York Sun |location= |date=1942-12-10 |page=37 |quote= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Brooklyn Eagle Jan 1943\">{{cite news |title=Brooklyn Society of Artists at Brooklyn Museum |author= |work=Brooklyn Daily Eagle |location=Brooklyn, N.Y. |date=1943-01-21 |page=9 |quote= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Brooklyn Eagle Apr 1943\">{{cite news |title=Joseph Biel, Noted Artist And World Traveler, Dies |author=Helen Appleton Read |work=Brooklyn Daily Eagle |location=Brooklyn, N.Y. |date=1943-04-25 |page=19 |quote= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Brooklyn Eagle Apr 1944\">{{cite news |title=At The Art Galleries; Brooklyn Society of Artists Shows 28th Annual at Brooklyn Museum |author= |work=Brooklyn Daily Eagle |location=Brooklyn, N.Y. |date=1944-04-09 |page=22 |quote=It takes a thoroughly sympathetic understanding to penetrate the depths of a fraternal tenement spirit between two front stoop neighbors.

The other canvas mentioned is more complicated and fanciful in design with a dash of something very like wishful thinking.

These pictures are decorative and color is sprightly, but they lack in all but the most superficial way the sense of place.
