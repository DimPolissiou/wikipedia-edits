The term is used \"as if it were a country.\"<ref>(angla) Though [[ethnologue:epo|Ethnologue]] refers only to Poland as a country for Esperanto-speakers, Esperanto is to be considered a ''transnational language''.</ref>\n\nAlthough it does not occupy its own area of Earth's surface, it can be said to constitute the 120 countries which have their own national Esperanto association.\n\n== Etymology and terminology ==\nThe word is formed analogously to country names. In Esperanto, the names of countries were traditionally formed from the ethnic name of their inhabitants plus the suffix ''-ujo'',  for example, \"France\" was ''Francujo'', from ''franco'' (a Frenchman).\n\nThe term analogous to ''Francujo'' would be ''Esperantistujo'' (Esperantist-nation). However, that would convey the idea of the physical body of people, whereas using the name of the language as the basis of the word gives it the more abstract connotation of a cultural sphere.\n\nCurrently, names of nation states are often formed with the suffix ''-io'' traditionally reserved for deriving country names from geographic features, so now ''Francio'', and recently the form ''Esperantio'' has been used ''i.a.'' in the [[Pasporta Servo]] and the Esperanto Citizens' Community.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main article|History of Esperanto}}\nIn 1908, Dr. William Molly attempted to create an Esperanto nation in [[Neutral Moresnet]] known as \"Amikejo\" (place of friendship). What became of it is unclear, and Neutral Moresnet was annexed to [[Belgium]] in the [[Treaty of Versailles, 1919]].<ref>http://www.moresnet.nl/english/geschiedenis_en.htm#Dr.%20Wilhelm%20Molly {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812001647/http://www.moresnet.nl/english/geschiedenis_en.htm |date=2012-08-12 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s came a new effort of creating an Esperanto state, which this time was called [[Republic of Rose Island]]. The state island stood in the [[Adriatic Sea]] near [[Italy]].\n\nAfter [[World War II]], during Esperanto events a [[Stelo|common currency]] was used, but the management has stopped at the end of the 20th century.\n\nIn Europe on 2 June 2001 a number of organizations (they prefer to call themselves establishments) founded the ''[[Esperanta Civito]]'', which \"aims to be a subject of international law\" and \"aims to consolidate the relations between the Esperantists who feel themselves belonging to the diaspora language group which does not belong to any country\". ''Esperanto Civito'' always uses the name Esperantujo (introduced by [[Hector Hodler]] in 1908), which itself is defined according to their interpretation of ''[[raumism]]'', and the meaning, therefore, may differ from the traditional Esperanto understanding of the word ''Esperantujo''.\n\nIn April 2007 there was an [[Esperanto Republic]] founded as a joke.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:PS mapo 2015.png|thumb|400x400px|Cities in the world with Pasporta Servo hosts]]\n{{see also|Pasporta Servo|Herzberg am Harz}}\nEsperantujo means any physical place as Esperanto meetings or virtual networks where they meet Esperanto speakers. Sometimes it is said that it is everywhere, where Esperanto speakers are yet connected.\n\nThere is a German city, [[Herzberg am Harz]], which since 12 July 2006 is called \"the Esperanto city\".<ref>[http://esperanto-urbo.de/page.php?pid=77507155 Retejo de Hercbergo]</ref> There are bilingual signs and pointers, in both [[German language|German]] and Esperanto.\n\nJudging by the members of the [[World Esperanto Association]], the countries where there the most Esperanto speakers are (in descending order):<ref>''Jarlibro de UEA'', p. 248-249. Rotterdam, the Netherlands, 2016.  {{ISSN|0075-3491}}.</ref> Brazil, Germany, Japan, France, the United States, China, Italy.\n\nA language learning partner application called [[Amikumu]] has been launched in 2017, allowing Esperanto speakers to find one each other.<ref>[http://www.polyglotnerd.com/blog/2016/10/24/interview-with-richard-delamore-founder-of-the-app-amikumu/ Interview with Richard Delamore, founder of the app Amikumu]</ref>\n\n== Politics ==\n\n=== Associations ===\n[[File:2015-08-01 Estraro-uea 100a-uk.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Leaders of [[Universal Esperanto Association]] during 100th [[World Esperanto Congress]] in [[Lille]], [[France]] in 2015.]]\n{{Main article|List of Esperanto organizations}}\n{{See also|Universal Esperanto Association|World Esperanto Youth Organization|Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda}}\nThere is no governmental system in Esperantujo because it is not a true state. However, there is a social hierarchy of associations:\n\n* [[Universal Esperanto Association]] (UEA) is the principal association created in 1908, its central office is located in [[Rotterdam]]. The aim of the UEA is to promote the use of Esperanto, to strive for the solution of the language problem in international relations, to encourage all types of spiritual and material relations among people and ''to nurture among its members a strong sense of solidarity, and to develop in them understanding and respect for other peoples''.\n* Sometimes exist associations by continent, for example, the [[European Esperanto Union]]. On the same level exist UEA commissions dedicated to promote spreading of Esperanto in Africa, America (North & South), Asia, Middle-East & North Africa, and Oceania.\n* In at least 120 countries in the world exist national associations: [[Brazilian Esperanto League]], the [[German Esperanto Association]], [[Japanese Esperanto Association]], [[Esperanto-USA]] and [[Australian Esperanto Association]] are examples from all continents across the world. The goals are usually to help teach the language and use of Esperanto in the country.\n* Finally, there exist local associations or [[Esperanto club]]s where volunteers or activists offer courses to learn the language or get to know more about the [[Esperanto culture|culture of Esperanto]]. Sometimes they teach Esperanto in universities or schools.\n\nAlso there are thematic associations worldwide, which are concerned with spirituality, hobbies, science or that brings together Esperantists which share common interests.\n\nThere is also a number of global organizations, such as [[Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda]] (SAT), or the [[World Esperanto Youth Organization]] (TEJO), which has 46 national sections.\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n[[Universal Esperanto Association]] is not a governmental system; however, the association represents Esperanto worldwide. In addition to the [[United Nations]] and [[UNESCO]],<ref>[https://archive.today/20160623010401/http://ngo-db.unesco.org/d/or/en/1100039679 Pagxo pri UEA en la retejo de Unesko]</ref> the UEA has consultative relationships with [[UNICEF]] and the [[Council of Europe]]<ref name=\"KER\">[http://www.coe.int/en/web/portfolio/self-assessment-grid Esperanto aperas en la [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages|KER]]-listo ene de la retejo de Konsilio de Euxropo]</ref> and general cooperative relations with the [[Organization of American States]]. UEA officially collaborates with the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) by means of an active connection to the ISO Committee on terminology (ISO/TC 37). The association is active for information on the [[European Union]] and other interstate and international organizations and conferences. UEA is a member of [[European Language Council]], a joint forum of universities and linguistic associations to promote the knowledge of languages and cultures within and outside the European Union. Moreover, on 10 May 2011, the UEA and the [[Infoterm|International Information Center for Terminology]] (Infoterm) signed an Agreement on Cooperation, its objectives are inter exchange information, support each other and help out for projects, meetings, publications in the field of terminology and by which the UEA become Associate Member of Infoterm.\n\n=== Political movement ===\nIn 2003 there was a European political movement called [[Europe\u2013Democracy\u2013Esperanto]] created. Within it is found a European federation that brings together local associations whose statutes depends on the countries. Working language of the movement is Esperanto. The goal is \"to provide the [[European Union]] with the necessary tools to set up member rights democracy\". The [[international auxiliary language|international language]] is a tool to enable cross-border political and social dialogue and actively contribute to peace and understanding between peoples. The original idea in the first ballot was mainly to spread the existence and the use of Esperanto to the general public. However, in France voices have grown steadily: 25067 (2004) 28944 (2009) and 33115 (2014). In this country there are a number of movements which support the issue: [[France \u00c9quit\u00e9]], [[Europe-Libert\u00e9]], and [[Politicat]].\n\n=== Symbols ===\n{{See also|Esperanto symbols}}\n[[File:Flag of Esperanto.svg|thumb|[[Verda Flago]].]]\nThe [[Esperanto-flag]] is called ''Verda Flago'' (Green Flag). It consists of:\n* a rectangular shape, officially with a 2:3 ratio.\n* a green field, where the green color symbolizes hope. There is no indication that any \"official\" color was ever chosen. The color green used varies in different sources, yet the color {{Color|#009900|009900}} is most often used.\n* a white, square [[Canton (flag)|canton]] (upper hoist quarter), measuring exactly half the hoist, where the white color symbolizes peace and neutrality.\n* in the canton, a green five-pointed [[Star (heraldry)|star]] known as ''Verda Stelo'' (Green Star), which symbolizes the five continents.\n\nThe anthem is called ''\"La Espero\"'' since 1891: it is a poem written by [[L. L. Zamenhof]]. The song is usually sung at the triumphal march composed by [[F\u00e9licien Menu de M\u00e9nil]] in 1909.\n\nThe Jubilee symbol represents the language internally, while the flag represents Esperanto movement. It contains the Latin letter E (Esperanto) and the Cyrillic letter \u042d (\u042d\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u043e) symbolizing the unification of West and East.\n\nIn addition, Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof, the initiator of the language, is often used as a symbol. Sometimes he is even called \"Uncle Zam\", referring to the cartoon incarnation of American [[Uncle Sam]].\n\n== Population ==\n\n=== Education ===\n[[File:KER-Ekzameno Atestilo C1.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Certificate of KER-exam]]\n{{See also|International League of Esperanto Teachers|Conference on the Application of Esperanto in Science and Technology}}\nIn addition to textbooks, including the ''[[Fundamento de Esperanto]]'' by Zamenhof, the [[Assimil]]-methods and the video-methods such as [[Muzzy in Gondoland]] of the [[BBC]] and ''[[Pasporto al la tuta mondo]]'', there are many courses for learning online. Moreover, some universities teach Esperanto, and the [[ELTE-ITK|Higher Foreign Language training (University E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd)]] delivers certificates in accordance with the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] (CEFR).<ref name=\"KER\" /> More than 1600 people have such a certificate around the world: in 2014 around 470 at the level of B1, 510 at the level of B2 and 700 for C1.<ref>[http://edukado.net/ekzamenoj/ker/statistiko Statistikoj pri la atestiloj de KER-ekzamenoj en Edukado.net]</ref> The [[International League of Esperanto Teachers]] (ILEI) is also working to publish learning materials for teachers.\n\nThe [http://universitato.info/kursaro.htm University of Esperanto] offers video lectures in Esperanto, for specialties like Confronting War, Informational Technologies and Astronomy. Courses are also held during the [[World Esperanto Congress]] in the framework of the [[Internacia Kongresa Universitato]] (IKU). After that, [[Universal Esperanto Association|UEA]] uploads the related documents on its website.<ref>[http://uea.org/dokumentoj/IKU/ Kursoj de Internacia Kongresa Universitato]</ref>\n\nScience is an appropriate department for works in Esperanto. For example, the [[Conference on the Application of Esperanto in Science and Technology]] (KAEST) occurs in November every year since 1998 in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]]. Personal initiatives are also common: Doctor of mathematics [[Ulrich Matthias]] created a document about the foundations of Linear Algebra<ref>[http://www.u-matthias.de/verko/lin_alg.pdf ''Fundamentoj de lineara algebro''], Ulrich Matthias</ref> and the American group of [[Maine]] (USA) wrote a guidebook to learn the programming language [[Python (programming language)|Python]].<ref>[http://esperanto-me.org/pitono/p01_Enhavoj.htm Instruilo por la programlingvo Pitono]</ref>\n\nIn general, Esperanto is used as a [[lingua franca]] in some websites aiming teaching of other languages, such as [[German language|German]],<ref>[http://deutsch.info/eo Deutsch.info instruas la germanan per Esperanto]</ref> [[Slovak language|Slovak]],<ref>[http://slovake.eu/eo/ Slovake.eu instruas la slovakan per Esperanto]</ref> [[Swahili language|Swahili]],<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye693UXx0WG4 Svahila kurseto] cxe [[YouTube|Jutubo]]</ref> [[Wolof language|Wolof]]<ref>[http://www.esperanto-afriko.org/Wolof%20per%20esperanto.pdf PDF-a enkonduko al la lingvo volofa]</ref> or [[Toki Pona]].<ref>[http://www.tokipona.info/ Tokipona.info instruas Tokiponon per Esperanto]</ref>\n\n=== Media ===\nSince 1889 when ''[[La Esperantisto]]'' appeared, and soon other magazines in Esperanto throughout many countries in the world. Some of them are information media of Esperanto associations (''[[Esperanto (magazine)|Esperanto]]'', ''[[Sennaciulo]]'' and ''[[Kontakto]]''). Online Esperanto magazines like ''[[Libera Folio]]'', launched in 2003, offer independent view of the Esperanto movement, aiming to soberly and critically shed light on current development. Most of the magazines deal with current events; one of such magazines is ''[[Monato]]'', which is read in more than 60 countries. Its articles are written by correspondents from 40 countries, which know the local situation very well.<ref>[http://www.esperanto.be/fel/mon/mon_kolo.php Kolofono de ''Monato'']</ref> Other most popular<ref>[http://esperantorondo.blogspot.fr/2015/07/la-plej-popularaj-esperanto-gazetoj.html Vocxdonado pri la plej popularaj Esperanto-gazetoj]</ref><ref>\u201cLegado de esperantaj gazetoj\u201d, en ''UEA en konscio de Esperantistoj'', p. 39-41</ref> Esperanto newspapers are ''[[La Ondo de Esperanto]]'', ''[[Beletra Almanako]]'', ''[[Literatura Foiro]]'', and ''[[Heroldo de Esperanto]]''. Often national associations magazines are also published in order to inform about the movement in the country, such as ''Le Monde de l'esp\u00e9ranto'' of [[Esp\u00e9ranto-France]]. There are also scientific journals, such as ''[[Scienca Revuo]]'' of [[Internacia Scienca Asocio Esperantista]] (ISAE).\n\n''[[Muzaiko]]'' is a radio that has broadcast an all-day international program of songs, interviews and current events in Esperanto since 2011. The latest two can be downloaded as podcasts.<ref>[http://muzaiko.info/programeroj/listo-de-la-programeroj Listo de la programoj de Muzaiko.info]</ref> Besides Muzaiko, these other stations offer an hour of Esperanto-language broadcasting of various topics: ''[[Radio Libertaire]]'', ''[[Polskie Radio]]'', ''[[Vatican Radio]]'', ''[[Varsovia Vento]], ''[[Radio Verda]] and ''[[Kern.punkto]]''.\n\n=== Internet ===\nSpread of the [[Internet]] has enabled more efficient communication among Esperanto speakers and slightly replaced slower media such as [[mail]]. Many massively used websites such as [[Facebook]] or [[Google]] offer Esperanto interface.<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/translations/ Traduku Fejsbukon]</ref><ref>[http://www.google.com/intl/eo/ Guglo en Esperanto]</ref> On 15 December 2009, on the occasion of the jubilee of 150th birthday of [[L. L. Zamenhof]], Google additionally made visible the Esperanto flag as a part of their [[Google Doodles]].<ref>[http://www.liberafolio.org/2009/google-festas-la-zamenhof-tagon/ \u201cGoogle festas la Zamenhof-tagon\u201d], artikolo el [[Libera Folio]]</ref> Media as [[Twitter]], [[Telegram]], [[Reddit]] or [[Ipernity]] also contain a significant number of people in this community. In addition, content-providers such as [[WordPress]] and [[YouTube]] also enable bloggers write in Esperanto. Esperanto versions of programs such as the office suite [[LibreOffice]] and [[Mozilla Firefox]] browser, or the educational program about programming [[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch]] are also available. Additionally, online games like [[Minecraft]] offer complete Esperanto interface.\n\n[[Monero (cryptocurrency)|Monero]], an anonymous [[cryptocurrency]], was named after the Esperanto word for \"''coin''\" and its official [[Cryptocurrency wallet|wallet]] is available in Esperanto. The same applies to [https://monerujo.io Monerujo] (''\"Monero container\"''), the only [[Open-source software|open-source]] wallet for [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. \n\n=== Sport ===\nAlthough Esperanto is not a country, there is an [[Esperanto football team]], which has existed since 2014 and participates in matches during [[World Esperanto Congress]]es.<ref>{{in lang|eo}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9UkAf7Tm8U Intervjuo de Osmo Buller (Gxenerala Direktoro de UEA) pri la futbalmatcxo dum la 99a UK]</ref> The team is part of the [[N.F.-Board]] and not of [[FIFA]], and have played against the teams of Armenian-originating Argentine Community in 2014 and the team from [[Western Sahara]] in 2015.\n\n=== Esperanto speakers and Esperantists ===\n\n{{Further information|Native Esperanto speakers}}\n{{See also|World Esperanto Congress|International Youth Congress of Esperanto}}\nInitially, Esperanto speakers learned the language as it was described by [[L. L. Zamenhof]].<ref>The book ''Lingvaj respondoj de Ludoviko'' (Eldonejo Ludovikito, 1990, 7-a eld.) contains about 120 pages of answers of Zamenhof to questions of Esperanto learners between 1887 and 1912.</ref> In 1905 the ''[[Fundamento de Esperanto]]'' put together the first Esperanto textbook, an exercise book and a universal dictionary.<ref>The speech of Zamenhof during the 8th [[Universala Kongreso de Esperanto]] in [[Krakow|Krakovo]] (1912)shows that he does not want to take part in the language community as the \u201cMajstro\u201d.</ref>\n\nThe [[Declaration of Boulogne|\"Declaration about the essence of Esperantism\"]] (1905) defines an \"Esperantist\" to be anyone who speaks and uses Esperanto.<ref>''UEA en konscio de Esperantistoj'', Zbigniew Galor and Jukka Pietil\u00e4inen, Kava-Pech, 2015, p. 14</ref> \"Esperantism\" was defined to be a movement to promote the widespread use of Esperanto as a supplement to [[First language|mother tongues]] in international and inter-ethnic contexts. As the word \"esperantist\" is linked with this \"esperantism\" (the [[Esperanto movement]]) and as -ists and -isms are linked with ideologies, today many people who speak Esperanto prefer to be called \"Esperanto speaker\".\n\nThe monthly magazine ''[[La Ondo de Esperanto]]'' every year since 1998 proclaims an 'Esperantist of the year', who remarkably contributed to the spreading of the language during the year.\n\n== Economy ==\n\n=== Businesses ===\nPublishing and selling books, the so-called book services, is the main market and is often the first expenditure of many Esperanto associations. Some companies are already well known: for example [[Vinilkosmo]], which publishes and makes popular Esperanto music since 1990. Then there are initiatives such as the job-seeking website ''[[Eklaboru]]'', created by [[Chuck Smith (Esperantist)|Chuck Smith]], for job offers and candidates within Esperanto associations or Esperanto meetings.\n\n=== Currency ===\n{{Main article|Stelo}}\nIn 1907, [[Ren\u00e9 de Saussure]] proposed the [[spesmilo]] \u27e8\u20b7\u27e9 as an international currency.\nIt had some use before the First World War.\nThe currency [[Stelo]] was created in 1942 and has been used at meetings of the ''[[Universala Ligo]]'' and in Esperanto environments. Over the years it slowly became unusable and at the official closing of the Universala Ligo in the 1990s, the remaining star-coins were handed over to the [[Universal Esperanto Association|UEA]]. You can buy them at the UEA's book service as souvenirs.\n\nThe current ''steloj'' are made of plastic, they are used in a number of meetings, especially among young people. The currency is maintained by Stelaro, which calculates the rates, keeps the stock, and opened branches in various e-meetings. Currently, there are ''stelo''-coins of 1 \u2605, 3 \u2605 and 10 \u2605. Quotes of Stars at 31 December 2014 were [25] 1 EUR = 4.189 \u2605.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://stelaro.alesk.eu/ |title=Kurzoj |access-date=2016-06-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231035935/http://stelaro.alesk.eu/ |archive-date=2014-12-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n{{Main article|Esperanto culture}}\n\n=== Architectural heritage ===\n[[File:A\u016dstrio-Vieno-Zamenhof-monumento-2.jpg|thumb|right|L. L. Zamenhof [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] in the [[Esperantopark]] in [[Vienna]]]]\nThere exist [[Zamenhof-Esperanto object]]s (ZEOs), scattered in numerous countries around the world, which are the things named in honor of [[L. L. Zamenhof]] or Esperanto: monuments, street names, places and so on. There also exists a [[Universal Esperanto Association|UEA]]-committee for ZEOs.<ref>[http://www.uea.org/asocio/komisionoj/zeoj \u201cZamenhof/Esperanto-objektoj (ZEO-j)\u201d en la retejo de UEA]</ref>\n\nIn addition, in several countries there are also sites dedicated to Esperanto: meetup places, workshops, seminars, festivals, Esperanto houses. These places provide attractions for Esperantists. Here are two: the [[Castle of Gr\u00e9silion]] in [[France]] and the [[Department of Planned Languages and Esperanto Museum]] in [[Vienna]] ([[Austria]]).\n\n=== Cultural heritage ===\n[[File:2008-07-19 kd-oj en uk-ls.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Music in Esperanto]]\n{{main article|Esperanto literature}}\nEsperanto literary heritage is the richest and the most diverse of any constructed language. There are over 25,000 Esperanto books (originals and translations) as well as over a hundred regularly distributed [[List of Esperanto magazines|Esperanto magazines]].\n\nThere are also a [[List of Esperanto-language films|number of movies]] which have been published in Esperanto. Moreover, Esperanto itself was used in numerous movies.\n\n=== Celebrations ===\nMany public holidays recognized by Esperanto speakers are celebrated international and already accepted in other countries and organizations such as [[UN]] or [[UNESCO]]. Here are the celebrations internationally proposed by the [[Universal Esperanto Association|UEA]] since 2010:\n{| class=\"wikitable alternance\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Meaning, purpose, anniversary\n|-\n| February 21\n| [[International Mother Language Day]]\n| Saving cultural diversity and multilingualism\n|-\n| last full week of February\n| [[Week of International Friendship]]\n| Strengthening mutual contacts and sense.\n|-\n| April 14\n| Memorial Day of all Pioneers\n| Anniversary of the death of [[L.

Usual trade of Esperanto-books.\n|}\n\n=== Cultural events ===\n[[File:Renkontighoj en Germanio partoprenantoj.png|thumb|250px|Number of participants of Esperanto-meeting in Central Europe]]\nEvery year numerous meetings of Esperanto speakers in different topics around the world take place. They mobilize Esperanto-speakers which share the same will about a specific topic. The main example is the [[Universal Congress of Esperanto]] (UK), which annually organizes the [[Universal Esperanto Association|UEA]] every summer for a week.

The term is used \"as if it were a country.\"<ref>(angla) Though [[ethnologue:epo|Ethnologue]] refers only to Poland as a country for Esperanto-speakers, Esperanto is to be considered a ''transnational language''.</ref>\n\nAlthough it does not occupy its own area of Earth's surface, it can be said to constitute the 120 countries which have their own national Esperanto association.\n\n== Etymology and terminology ==\nThe word is formed analogously to country names. In Esperanto, the names of countries were traditionally formed from the ethnic name of their inhabitants plus the suffix ''-ujo'',  for example, \"France\" was ''Francujo'', from ''franco'' (a Frenchman).\n\nThe term analogous to ''Francujo'' would be ''Esperantistujo'' (Esperantist-nation). However, that would convey the idea of the physical body of people, whereas using the name of the language as the basis of the word gives it the more abstract connotation of a cultural sphere.\n\nCurrently, names of nation states are often formed with the suffix ''-io'' traditionally reserved for deriving country names from geographic features, so now ''Francio'', and recently the form ''Esperantio'' has been used ''i.a.'' in the [[Pasporta Servo]] and the Esperanto Citizens' Community.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main article|History of Esperanto}}\nIn 1908, Dr. William Molly attempted to create an Esperanto nation in [[Neutral Moresnet]] known as \"Amikejo\" (place of friendship). What became of it is unclear, and Neutral Moresnet was annexed to [[Belgium]] in the [[Treaty of Versailles, 1919]].<ref>http://www.moresnet.nl/english/geschiedenis_en.htm#Dr.%20Wilhelm%20Molly {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812001647/http://www.moresnet.nl/english/geschiedenis_en.htm |date=2012-08-12 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s came a new effort of creating an Esperanto state, which this time was called [[Republic of Rose Island]]. The state island stood in the [[Adriatic Sea]] near [[Italy]].\n\nAfter [[World War II]], during Esperanto events a [[Stelo|common currency]] was used, but the management has stopped at the end of the 20th century.\n\nIn Europe on 2 June 2001 a number of organizations (they prefer to call themselves establishments) founded the ''[[Esperanta Civito]]'', which \"aims to be a subject of international law\" and \"aims to consolidate the relations between the Esperantists who feel themselves belonging to the diaspora language group which does not belong to any country\". ''Esperanto Civito'' always uses the name Esperantujo (introduced by [[Hector Hodler]] in 1908), which itself is defined according to their interpretation of ''[[raumism]]'', and the meaning, therefore, may differ from the traditional Esperanto understanding of the word ''Esperantujo''.\n\nIn April 2007 there was an [[Esperanto Republic]] founded as a joke.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:PS mapo 2015.png|thumb|400x400px|Cities in the world with Pasporta Servo hosts]]\n{{see also|Pasporta Servo|Herzberg am Harz}}\nEsperantujo means any physical place as Esperanto meetings or virtual networks where they meet Esperanto speakers. Sometimes it is said that it is everywhere, where Esperanto speakers are yet connected.\n\nThere is a German city, [[Herzberg am Harz]], which since 12 July 2006 is called \"the Esperanto city\".<ref>[http://esperanto-urbo.de/page.php?pid=77507155 Retejo de Hercbergo]</ref> There are bilingual signs and pointers, in both [[German language|German]] and Esperanto.\n\nJudging by the members of the [[World Esperanto Association]], the countries where there the most Esperanto speakers are (in descending order):<ref>''Jarlibro de UEA'', p. 248-249. Rotterdam, the Netherlands, 2016.  {{ISSN|0075-3491}}.</ref> Brazil, Germany, Japan, France, the United States, China, Italy.\n\nA language learning partner application called [[Amikumu]] has been launched in 2017, allowing Esperanto speakers to find one each other.<ref>[http://www.polyglotnerd.com/blog/2016/10/24/interview-with-richard-delamore-founder-of-the-app-amikumu/ Interview with Richard Delamore, founder of the app Amikumu]</ref>\n\n== Politics ==\n\n=== Associations ===\n[[File:2015-08-01 Estraro-uea 100a-uk.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Leaders of [[Universal Esperanto Association]] during 100th [[World Esperanto Congress]] in [[Lille]], [[France]] in 2015.]]\n{{Main article|List of Esperanto organizations}}\n{{See also|Universal Esperanto Association|World Esperanto Youth Organization|Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda}}\nThere is no governmental system in Esperantujo because it is not a true state. However, there is a social hierarchy of associations:\n\n* [[Universal Esperanto Association]] (UEA) is the principal association created in 1908, its central office is located in [[Rotterdam]]. The aim of the UEA is to promote the use of Esperanto, to strive for the solution of the language problem in international relations, to encourage all types of spiritual and material relations among people and ''to nurture among its members a strong sense of solidarity, and to develop in them understanding and respect for other peoples''.\n* Sometimes exist associations by continent, for example, the [[European Esperanto Union]]. On the same level exist UEA commissions dedicated to promote spreading of Esperanto in Africa, America (North & South), Asia, Middle-East & North Africa, and Oceania.\n* In at least 120 countries in the world exist national associations: [[Brazilian Esperanto League]], the [[German Esperanto Association]], [[Japanese Esperanto Association]], [[Esperanto-USA]] and [[Australian Esperanto Association]] are examples from all continents across the world. The goals are usually to help teach the language and use of Esperanto in the country.\n* Finally, there exist local associations or [[Esperanto club]]s where volunteers or activists offer courses to learn the language or get to know more about the [[Esperanto culture|culture of Esperanto]]. Sometimes they teach Esperanto in universities or schools.\n\nAlso there are thematic associations worldwide, which are concerned with spirituality, hobbies, science or that brings together Esperantists which share common interests.\n\nThere is also a number of global organizations, such as [[Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda]] (SAT), or the [[World Esperanto Youth Organization]] (TEJO), which has 46 national sections.\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n[[Universal Esperanto Association]] is not a governmental system; however, the association represents Esperanto worldwide. In addition to the [[United Nations]] and [[UNESCO]],<ref>[https://archive.today/20160623010401/http://ngo-db.unesco.org/d/or/en/1100039679 Pagxo pri UEA en la retejo de Unesko]</ref> the UEA has consultative relationships with [[UNICEF]] and the [[Council of Europe]]<ref name=\"KER\">[http://www.coe.int/en/web/portfolio/self-assessment-grid Esperanto aperas en la [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages|KER]]-listo ene de la retejo de Konsilio de Euxropo]</ref> and general cooperative relations with the [[Organization of American States]]. UEA officially collaborates with the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) by means of an active connection to the ISO Committee on terminology (ISO/TC 37). The association is active for information on the [[European Union]] and other interstate and international organizations and conferences. UEA is a member of [[European Language Council]], a joint forum of universities and linguistic associations to promote the knowledge of languages and cultures within and outside the European Union. Moreover, on 10 May 2011, the UEA and the [[Infoterm|International Information Center for Terminology]] (Infoterm) signed an Agreement on Cooperation, its objectives are inter exchange information, support each other and help out for projects, meetings, publications in the field of terminology and by which the UEA become Associate Member of Infoterm.\n\n=== Political movement ===\nIn 2003 there was a European political movement called [[Europe\u2013Democracy\u2013Esperanto]] created. Within it is found a European federation that brings together local associations whose statutes depends on the countries. Working language of the movement is Esperanto. The goal is \"to provide the [[European Union]] with the necessary tools to set up member rights democracy\". The [[international auxiliary language|international language]] is a tool to enable cross-border political and social dialogue and actively contribute to peace and understanding between peoples. The original idea in the first ballot was mainly to spread the existence and the use of Esperanto to the general public. However, in France voices have grown steadily: 25067 (2004) 28944 (2009) and 33115 (2014). In this country there are a number of movements which support the issue: [[France \u00c9quit\u00e9]], [[Europe-Libert\u00e9]], and [[Politicat]].\n\n=== Symbols ===\n{{See also|Esperanto symbols}}\n[[File:Flag of Esperanto.svg|thumb|[[Verda Flago]].]]\nThe [[Esperanto-flag]] is called ''Verda Flago'' (Green Flag). It consists of:\n* a rectangular shape, officially with a 2:3 ratio.\n* a green field, where the green color symbolizes hope. There is no indication that any \"official\" color was ever chosen. The color green used varies in different sources, yet the color {{Color|#009900|009900}} is most often used.\n* a white, square [[Canton (flag)|canton]] (upper hoist quarter), measuring exactly half the hoist, where the white color symbolizes peace and neutrality.\n* in the canton, a green five-pointed [[Star (heraldry)|star]] known as ''Verda Stelo'' (Green Star), which symbolizes the five continents.\n\nThe anthem is called ''\"La Espero\"'' since 1891: it is a poem written by [[L. L. Zamenhof]]. The song is usually sung at the triumphal march composed by [[F\u00e9licien Menu de M\u00e9nil]] in 1909.\n\nThe Jubilee symbol represents the language internally, while the flag represents Esperanto movement. It contains the Latin letter E (Esperanto) and the Cyrillic letter \u042d (\u042d\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u043e) symbolizing the unification of West and East.\n\nIn addition, Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof, the initiator of the language, is often used as a symbol. Sometimes he is even called \"Uncle Zam\", referring to the cartoon incarnation of American [[Uncle Sam]].\n\n== Population ==\n\n=== Education ===\n[[File:KER-Ekzameno Atestilo C1.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Certificate of KER-exam]]\n{{See also|International League of Esperanto Teachers|Conference on the Application of Esperanto in Science and Technology}}\nIn addition to textbooks, including the ''[[Fundamento de Esperanto]]'' by Zamenhof, the [[Assimil]]-methods and the video-methods such as [[Muzzy in Gondoland]] of the [[BBC]] and ''[[Pasporto al la tuta mondo]]'', there are many courses for learning online. Moreover, some universities teach Esperanto, and the [[ELTE-ITK|Higher Foreign Language training (University E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd)]] delivers certificates in accordance with the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] (CEFR).<ref name=\"KER\" /> More than 1600 people have such a certificate around the world: in 2014 around 470 at the level of B1, 510 at the level of B2 and 700 for C1.<ref>[http://edukado.net/ekzamenoj/ker/statistiko Statistikoj pri la atestiloj de KER-ekzamenoj en Edukado.net]</ref> The [[International League of Esperanto Teachers]] (ILEI) is also working to publish learning materials for teachers.\n\nThe [http://universitato.info/kursaro.htm University of Esperanto] offers video lectures in Esperanto, for specialties like Confronting War, Informational Technologies and Astronomy. Courses are also held during the [[World Esperanto Congress]] in the framework of the [[Internacia Kongresa Universitato]] (IKU). After that, [[Universal Esperanto Association|UEA]] uploads the related documents on its website.<ref>[http://uea.org/dokumentoj/IKU/ Kursoj de Internacia Kongresa Universitato]</ref>\n\nScience is an appropriate department for works in Esperanto. For example, the [[Conference on the Application of Esperanto in Science and Technology]] (KAEST) occurs in November every year since 1998 in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]]. Personal initiatives are also common: Doctor of mathematics [[Ulrich Matthias]] created a document about the foundations of Linear Algebra<ref>[http://www.u-matthias.de/verko/lin_alg.pdf ''Fundamentoj de lineara algebro''], Ulrich Matthias</ref> and the American group of [[Maine]] (USA) wrote a guidebook to learn the programming language [[Python (programming language)|Python]].<ref>[http://esperanto-me.org/pitono/p01_Enhavoj.htm Instruilo por la programlingvo Pitono]</ref>\n\nIn general, Esperanto is used as a [[lingua franca]] in some websites aiming teaching of other languages, such as [[German language|German]],<ref>[http://deutsch.info/eo Deutsch.info instruas la germanan per Esperanto]</ref> [[Slovak language|Slovak]],<ref>[http://slovake.eu/eo/ Slovake.eu instruas la slovakan per Esperanto]</ref> [[Swahili language|Swahili]],<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye693UXx0WG4 Svahila kurseto] cxe [[YouTube|Jutubo]]</ref> [[Wolof language|Wolof]]<ref>[http://www.esperanto-afriko.org/Wolof%20per%20esperanto.pdf PDF-a enkonduko al la lingvo volofa]</ref> or [[Toki Pona]].<ref>[http://www.tokipona.info/ Tokipona.info instruas Tokiponon per Esperanto]</ref>\n\n=== Media ===\nSince 1889 when ''[[La Esperantisto]]'' appeared, and soon other magazines in Esperanto throughout many countries in the world. Some of them are information media of Esperanto associations (''[[Esperanto (magazine)|Esperanto]]'', ''[[Sennaciulo]]'' and ''[[Kontakto]]''). Online Esperanto magazines like ''[[Libera Folio]]'', launched in 2003, offer independent view of the Esperanto movement, aiming to soberly and critically shed light on current development. Most of the magazines deal with current events; one of such magazines is ''[[Monato]]'', which is read in more than 60 countries. Its articles are written by correspondents from 40 countries, which know the local situation very well.<ref>[http://www.esperanto.be/fel/mon/mon_kolo.php Kolofono de ''Monato'']</ref> Other most popular<ref>[http://esperantorondo.blogspot.fr/2015/07/la-plej-popularaj-esperanto-gazetoj.html Vocxdonado pri la plej popularaj Esperanto-gazetoj]</ref><ref>\u201cLegado de esperantaj gazetoj\u201d, en ''UEA en konscio de Esperantistoj'', p. 39-41</ref> Esperanto newspapers are ''[[La Ondo de Esperanto]]'', ''[[Beletra Almanako]]'', ''[[Literatura Foiro]]'', and ''[[Heroldo de Esperanto]]''. Often national associations magazines are also published in order to inform about the movement in the country, such as ''Le Monde de l'esp\u00e9ranto'' of [[Esp\u00e9ranto-France]]. There are also scientific journals, such as ''[[Scienca Revuo]]'' of [[Internacia Scienca Asocio Esperantista]] (ISAE).\n\n''[[Muzaiko]]'' is a radio that has broadcast an all-day international program of songs, interviews and current events in Esperanto since 2011. The latest two can be downloaded as podcasts.<ref>[http://muzaiko.info/programeroj/listo-de-la-programeroj Listo de la programoj de Muzaiko.info]</ref> Besides Muzaiko, these other stations offer an hour of Esperanto-language broadcasting of various topics: ''[[Radio Libertaire]]'', ''[[Polskie Radio]]'', ''[[Vatican Radio]]'', ''[[Varsovia Vento]], ''[[Radio Verda]] and ''[[Kern.punkto]]''.\n\n=== Internet ===\nSpread of the [[Internet]] has enabled more efficient communication among Esperanto speakers and slightly replaced slower media such as [[mail]]. Many massively used websites such as [[Facebook]] or [[Google]] offer Esperanto interface.<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/translations/ Traduku Fejsbukon]</ref><ref>[http://www.google.com/intl/eo/ Guglo en Esperanto]</ref> On 15 December 2009, on the occasion of the jubilee of 150th birthday of [[L.

In addition, content-providers such as [[WordPress]] and [[YouTube]] also enable bloggers write in Esperanto. Esperanto versions of programs such as the office suite [[LibreOffice]] and [[Mozilla Firefox]] browser, or the educational program about programming [[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch]] are also available. Additionally, online games like [[Minecraft]] offer complete Esperanto interface.\n\n[[Monero (cryptocurrency)|Monero]], an anonymous [[cryptocurrency]], was named after the Esperanto word for \"''coin''\" and its official [[Cryptocurrency wallet|wallet]] is available in Esperanto. The same applies to [https://monerujo.io Monerujo] (''\"Monero container\"''), the only [[Open-source software|open-source]] wallet for [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. \n\n=== Sport ===\nAlthough Esperanto is not a country, there is an [[Esperanto football team]], which has existed since 2014 and participates in matches during [[World Esperanto Congress]]es.<ref>{{in lang|eo}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9UkAf7Tm8U Intervjuo de Osmo Buller (Gxenerala Direktoro de UEA) pri la futbalmatcxo dum la 99a UK]</ref> The team is part of the [[N.F.-Board]] and not of [[FIFA]], and have played against the teams of Armenian-originating Argentine Community in 2014 and the team from [[Western Sahara]] in 2015.\n\n=== Esperanto speakers and Esperantists ===\n\n{{Further information|Native Esperanto speakers}}\n{{See also|World Esperanto Congress|International Youth Congress of Esperanto}}\nInitially, Esperanto speakers learned the language as it was described by [[L. L. Zamenhof]].<ref>The book ''Lingvaj respondoj de Ludoviko'' (Eldonejo Ludovikito, 1990, 7-a eld.) contains about 120 pages of answers of Zamenhof to questions of Esperanto learners between 1887 and 1912.</ref> In 1905 the ''[[Fundamento de Esperanto]]'' put together the first Esperanto textbook, an exercise book and a universal dictionary.<ref>The speech of Zamenhof during the 8th [[Universala Kongreso de Esperanto]] in [[Krakow|Krakovo]] (1912)shows that he does not want to take part in the language community as the \u201cMajstro\u201d.</ref>\n\nThe [[Declaration of Boulogne|\"Declaration about the essence of Esperantism\"]] (1905) defines an \"Esperantist\" to be anyone who speaks and uses Esperanto.<ref>''UEA en konscio de Esperantistoj'', Zbigniew Galor and Jukka Pietil\u00e4inen, Kava-Pech, 2015, p. 14</ref> \"Esperantism\" was defined to be a movement to promote the widespread use of Esperanto as a supplement to [[First language|mother tongues]] in international and inter-ethnic contexts. As the word \"esperantist\" is linked with this \"esperantism\" (the [[Esperanto movement]]) and as -ists and -isms are linked with ideologies, today many people who speak Esperanto prefer to be called \"Esperanto speaker\".\n\nThe monthly magazine ''[[La Ondo de Esperanto]]'' every year since 1998 proclaims an 'Esperantist of the year', who remarkably contributed to the spreading of the language during the year.\n\n== Economy ==\n\n=== Businesses ===\nPublishing and selling books, the so-called book services, is the main market and is often the first expenditure of many Esperanto associations. Some companies are already well known: for example [[Vinilkosmo]], which publishes and makes popular Esperanto music since 1990. Then there are initiatives such as the job-seeking website ''[[Eklaboru]]'', created by [[Chuck Smith (Esperantist)|Chuck Smith]], for job offers and candidates within Esperanto associations or Esperanto meetings.\n\n=== Currency ===\n{{Main article|Stelo}}\nIn 1907, [[Ren\u00e9 de Saussure]] proposed the [[spesmilo]] \u27e8\u20b7\u27e9 as an international currency.\nIt had some use before the First World War.\nThe currency [[Stelo]] was created in 1942 and has been used at meetings of the ''[[Universala Ligo]]'' and in Esperanto environments. Over the years it slowly became unusable and at the official closing of the Universala Ligo in the 1990s, the remaining star-coins were handed over to the [[Universal Esperanto Association|UEA]]. You can buy them at the UEA's book service as souvenirs.\n\nThe current ''steloj'' are made of plastic, they are used in a number of meetings, especially among young people. The currency is maintained by Stelaro, which calculates the rates, keeps the stock, and opened branches in various e-meetings. Currently, there are ''stelo''-coins of 1 \u2605, 3 \u2605 and 10 \u2605. Quotes of Stars at 31 December 2014 were [25] 1 EUR = 4.189 \u2605.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://stelaro.alesk.eu/ |title=Kurzoj |access-date=2016-06-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231035935/http://stelaro.alesk.eu/ |archive-date=2014-12-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n{{Main article|Esperanto culture}}\n\n=== Architectural heritage ===\n[[File:A\u016dstrio-Vieno-Zamenhof-monumento-2.jpg|thumb|right|L.

There also exists a [[Universal Esperanto Association|UEA]]-committee for ZEOs.<ref>[http://www.uea.org/asocio/komisionoj/zeoj \u201cZamenhof/Esperanto-objektoj (ZEO-j)\u201d en la retejo de UEA]</ref>\n\nIn addition, in several countries there are also sites dedicated to Esperanto: meetup places, workshops, seminars, festivals, Esperanto houses. These places provide attractions for Esperantists. Here are two: the [[Castle of Gr\u00e9silion]] in [[France]] and the [[Department of Planned Languages and Esperanto Museum]] in [[Vienna]] ([[Austria]]).\n\n=== Cultural heritage ===\n[[File:2008-07-19 kd-oj en uk-ls.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Music in Esperanto]]\n{{main article|Esperanto literature}}\nEsperanto literary heritage is the richest and the most diverse of any constructed language. There are over 25,000 Esperanto books (originals and translations) as well as over a hundred regularly distributed [[List of Esperanto magazines|Esperanto magazines]].\n\nThere are also a [[List of Esperanto-language films|number of movies]] which have been published in Esperanto. Moreover, Esperanto itself was used in numerous movies.\n\n=== Celebrations ===\nMany public holidays recognized by Esperanto speakers are celebrated international and already accepted in other countries and organizations such as [[UN]] or [[UNESCO]]. Here are the celebrations internationally proposed by the [[Universal Esperanto Association|UEA]] since 2010:\n{| class=\"wikitable alternance\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Meaning, purpose, anniversary\n|-\n| February 21\n| [[International Mother Language Day]]\n| Saving cultural diversity and multilingualism\n|-\n| last full week of February\n| [[Week of International Friendship]]\n| Strengthening mutual contacts and sense.\n|-\n| April 14\n| Memorial Day of all Pioneers\n| Anniversary of the death of [[L.

They mobilize Esperanto-speakers which share the same will about a specific topic. The main example is the [[Universal Congress of Esperanto]] (UK), which annually organizes the [[Universal Esperanto Association|UEA]] every summer for a week. Other events:\n* [[SAT-Kongreso]], annually organised by [[Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda]];\n* [[International Youth Congress of Esperanto]] (IJK), official annual congress of [[TEJO]];\n* [[Internacia Infana Kongreseto]] (IIK), arrangement for children between 6 and 16 years that occur simultaneously with and close to the Universal Congress of Esperanto;\n* [[Somera Esperanto-Studado]] (SES), the largest international Esperanto meeting aimed at learning of Esperanto.\n\nNext to these globally comprising meetings there are also local events such as [[Novjara Renkonti\u011do|New Year's Gathering]] (NR) or [[Esperanto Youth Week]] (JES), which occur during the last days of December and first days of January. These meetings seem to have been successful during the last 20 years.\n\nDue to the fact that there are a lot of Esperanto meetings around the globe, there are two websites which aim to list and share them.

The club joined the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as part of the [[1970 NFL season|1970]] [[AFL-NFL merger]]. The Bills have the distinction of being the only team to advance to four consecutive [[Super Bowl]]s between 1990 and 1993, but also the dubious distinction of losing all four of them.\n\nThe second NFL team to represent [[Buffalo, New York]], the Bills were founded by [[Ralph Wilson]], who owned the team from its establishment until his death in 2014. The team was then sold to [[Terrence Pegula]] and his wife [[Kim Pegula|Kim]] later that year.\n\n==Professional football in Buffalo before 1960==\n\nThe Bills were not the first professional football team to play in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], nor was it the first NFL team in the region. Professional football had been played in Buffalo and in upstate New York since the beginning of the 20th century. In 1915, [[Barney Lepper]]'s \"[[Buffalo (1920s NFL teams)|Buffalo All-Stars]]\" were founded; the team would later be replaced by the Niagaras in 1918, then the Prospects in 1919. The Prospects were the basis of what would become the \"Buffalo All-Americans,\" who joined what would become the NFL in 1920. After changing their name to the Bisons in 1924 (and, for one season, the Rangers in 1926), the team suspended operations in 1927, then came back in 1929 and re-folded at the end of that season.\n\nAfter Buffalo hosted two NFL games in 1938 (a practice that would become a semi-regular occurrence in the city until the current team's arrival), the [[American Football League (1940)|third American Football League]] installed the [[Buffalo Indians]] in the city; the Indians played two years before the league suspended and ultimately folded due to World War II. After the war, when the [[All-America Football Conference]] formed, Buffalo was again selected for a team; originally known as the ''Buffalo Bisons,'' the same name as a [[Buffalo Bisons|baseball team]] and (at the time) a [[Buffalo Bisons (AHL)|hockey team]] in the area, the team sought a new identity and named itself the \"[[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|Buffalo Bills]]\" in 1947. When the AAFC merged with the NFL in 1950, the AAFC Bills were merged into the [[Cleveland Browns]]. Though there was no connection between the AAFC team and the current team, the Bills name proved popular enough that it was used as the namesake for the future [[American Football League]] team that would form in 1959.\n\nThe forerunners to the [[Canadian Football League]] would also play at least one game in Buffalo in 1951.\n\n==1960\u20131985==\n===Bringing pro football back to Buffalo===\n[[File:War_Memorial_Stadium_Rockpile.JPG|left|250px|thumb|The remains of [[War Memorial Stadium (Buffalo)|War Memorial Stadium]], used as the home field of the [[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|AAFC Bills]] and the first home for the current team]]\nWhen [[Lamar Hunt]] announced the formation of the American Football League in the summer of 1959, Buffalo was one of the target cities Hunt sought. His first choice of owner, however, turned him down; [[Pat McGroder]] (then a liquor store owner and sports liaison with the city of Buffalo) was still hopeful that the threat of the AFL would prompt the NFL to come back to Buffalo to try to stop the AFL from gaining a foothold there (as the NFL would do with teams in Minnesota, Dallas, St. Louis and later Atlanta). McGroder's hopes never came to fruition, and in 1961, he took a position in the new Bills organization.\n\n[[Harry Wismer]], who was to own the [[New York Jets|Titans of New York]] franchise, reached out to insurance salesman and automobile heir [[Ralph Wilson|Ralph C. Wilson, Jr.]] to see if he was interested in joining the upstart league. (Both Wismer and Wilson were minority owners of NFL franchises at the time: Wilson part-owned the [[Detroit Lions]], while Wismer was a small partner in the [[Washington Redskins]] but had little power due to majority owner [[George Preston Marshall]]'s near-iron fist over the team and the league). Wilson agreed to field a team in the new league, with the words \"Count me in. I'll take a franchise anywhere you suggest.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1134343/index.htm |accessdate=September 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026074333/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1134343/index.htm |archivedate=October 26, 2012 }}</ref> Hunt gave him the choice of six cities: Miami, Buffalo, [[Cincinnati]], [[Saint Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Atlanta]], or [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. Wilson's first choice was Miami, but city officials there were wary of an upstart league after the failure of the [[Miami Seahawks]] over a decade prior and rejected the idea. (Once the AFL established itself, the city reversed its stance and allowed the [[Miami Dolphins]] to reside in the city.) In WWII, Ralph Wilson served aboard a minesweeper, the YMS-29, serving in the Mediterranean.  Wilson was an executive officer to the ship's captain, Buffalo native George E. Schaaf. Wilson remembered the Buffalo team in the old NFL and remembered his old ship's captain was from Buffalo.  Ralph Wilson reached out to the General Construction Contractor, George E. Schaaf who still resided there. Schaaf assured Wilson that pro-football interest was significant in Buffalo and assembled a coalition of key Buffalo figures who were able to interest Wilson in bringing the AFL franchise to Buffalo. Attorney Paul Crotty (father of [[Paul A. Crotty]] and a powerful Buffalo political figure) negotiated a sweetheart deal with [[War Memorial Stadium (Buffalo)|Civic Stadium]] in Buffalo, offering Wilson full control of the venue and a deep discount on rent. Their efforts to lobby Wilson to come to Buffalo were successful, and Wilson sent Hunt a telegram with the now-famous words, \"Count me in with Buffalo.\" <ref> Buffalo News 10/17/59 - Buffalo News 10/24/59 - Buffalo Bills Media Guide, 1960 - NY Journal 8/22/60 - Buffalo Bills Media Guide 1964.</ref>\n\n===The AFL years===\n[[File:Jack_Kemp_1961.jpg|thumb|right|The Bills signed former Chargers quarterback [[Jack Kemp]], who would lead Buffalo to back-to-back AFL Championship titles in the 1960s]]\n\nThe Buffalo Bills were a charter member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL) in [[1960 American Football League season|1960]]. After a public contest, the team adopted the same name as the [[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|AAFC Buffalo Bills]], the former [[All-America Football Conference]] team in Buffalo. The AAFC Bills franchise was named after the [[Buffalo Bills (quartet)|Buffalo Bills]], a popular [[barbershop quartet]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.singers.com/barbershop/buffalobills.html |title=The Buffalo Bills Barbershop Quartet |author= |date= |publisher=Primarily A Cappella |accessdate=6 August 2012}}</ref> whose name was a play on the name of the famed Wild West showman [[Buffalo Bill Cody]]. The franchises are not officially related, other than in name, to each other.\n\nAfter an inaugural season that saw the Bills finish 5\u20138\u20131 (third in the four-team AFL East Division), the Bills gained four of the first five picks in the 1961 AFL draft, including the top slot, which they used to draft offensive tackle [[Ken Rice (American football)|Ken Rice]]. They also drafted guard [[Billy Shaw]] in the same draft. Success did not come overnight. On August 8, [[1961 American Football League season|1961]], the Bills became the first (and only) [[American Football League]] team to play a [[Canadian Football League]] team, the nearby [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]]. Because of that game, they also hold the dubious distinction of being the only current NFL team to have ever lost to a CFL team, as the Tiger-Cats won, 38\u201321. Hamilton was one of the best teams in the CFL (they would go on to win the Big Four title but lose in the [[49th Grey Cup]] that year), and Buffalo, at the time, was the worst team in the AFL.\n\nIn the 1962 offseason, Buffalo began to get good players for the first time in franchise history. [[Jack Kemp]] was acquired off waivers from the [[San Diego Chargers]] after the Chargers thought Kemp, who had led the Chargers to back-to-back AFL title games, had a bum hand. The Bills also drafted [[Syracuse Orange football|Syracuse]] running back phenomenon [[Ernie Davis]] and had a serious chance of getting him to play for Buffalo after the Redskins, a team Davis refused to play for, drafted him; however, Davis instead opted to play for the NFL after the Redskins traded him to [[Cleveland Browns|Cleveland]], and he died of leukemia before playing a single down of professional football. Instead, the Bills then acquired one of the CFL's top running backs, [[Cookie Gilchrist]].\n\nOn December 14, 1963, the Bills and the [[New York Jets]] played the final game at the [[Polo Grounds]].<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/196312140nyj.htm |title=Buffalo Bills at New York Jets- December 14th, 1963 | author= |date= | publisher=Pro Football Reference |accessdate=2 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1963 to 1966, Buffalo experienced its first stretch of success, making the playoffs all four years and winning back-to-back AFL championships in [[1964 Buffalo Bills season|1964]] and [[1965 Buffalo Bills season|1965]] under head coach [[Lou Saban]]. The Bills made it to a third straight AFL championship game in [[1966 American Football League season|1966]], with the winner representing the AFL in the first [[Super Bowl I|AFL-NFL World Championship Game]], later known as ''Super Bowl I''. However, they lost to the [[1966 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]], who went on to play the [[1966 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]]. \n\nOffensive lineman [[Bob Kalsu]] quit the team after his [[1968 American Football League season|1968]] rookie season to serve in the [[Vietnam War]]. He never returned; Kalsu was killed in action in 1970 and is often cited by Bills fans as the first professional football player to die in action in war during his playing career. This is not true, as [[Young Bussey]] and [[Jack Lummus]] were still of playing age when they left the NFL to serve in [[World War II]] and were killed in action a few years later. Kalsu would be the only NFL player to lose his life in Vietnam.\n\nThe [[1968 American Football League season|1968 season]] was a tumultuous one. With starter Jack Kemp injured, Buffalo resorted to converting wide receiver [[Ed Rutkowski]] to quarterback in a rotation with Rutkowski, [[Kay Stephenson]] and [[Dan Darragh]]. The result was disastrous, and the [[1968 Buffalo Bills season|Bills]] once again dropped to last in the league, resulting in the Bills earning the first overall draft pick in what was now the combined [[1969 NFL Draft|AFL-NFL draft]]. The Bills selected [[O. J. Simpson]] with their pick.\n\n===1969\u20131977: The O.J. Simpson-\"Electric Company\" era===\n{{see also|Electric Company (football)}}\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 29 - O.J. Simpson (O.J. Simpson crop).jpg|thumb|right|[[O. J. Simpson]], the face of the Bills franchise for most of the 1970s, pictured breaking the NFL's single-season rushing record in 1973.]] Before the [[1969 American Football League season|1969 season]], the Bills drafted running back [[O. J. Simpson]], who would become the face of the franchise through the 1970s. The NFL-AFL merger placed Buffalo in the AFC East division with the Patriots, Dolphins, Jets, and Colts. Their first season in the NFL saw the team win only three games, lose ten, and tie one. In [[1971 NFL season|1971]], not only did the [[1971 Buffalo Bills season|Bills]] finish in sole possession of the NFL's worst overall record at 1\u201313, but they also scored the fewest points (184) in the league that year while allowing the most (394); no NFL team has since done all three of those things in the same season in a non-strike year. They thus obtained the #1 draft pick for 1972, which was Notre Dame DE [[Walt Patulski]]. Despite good on-field performances, he struggled with injuries before being traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in 1976. [[Lou Saban]], who had coached the Bills' AFL championship teams, was re-hired in [[1972 NFL season|1972]], in which the team finished 4\u20139\u20131.\n\nMeanwhile, [[War Memorial Stadium (Buffalo)|War Memorial Stadium]] was in severe need of replacement, being in poor condition, located in an increasingly worsening neighborhood, and too small to meet the NFL's post-1969 requirement that all stadiums seat at least 50,000. Construction began on a new stadium in the suburbs after Ralph Wilson threatened to move the team to another city; at one point after the 1970 season Wilson was \u201cprepared to move the team\u201d to [[Husky Stadium]] in [[Seattle]] and was also fielding offers from Tampa and Memphis.<ref name=bmmttos>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gDMsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xMsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2588%2C1883967 |newspaper=Spartanburg (SC) Herald |agency=Associated Press |title=Bills may move team to Seattle |date=January 13, 1971 |page=10}}</ref><ref name=mtexp>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=19710115&id=ezMsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xMsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4930,2267693|newspaper=Spartanburg (SC) Herald |title=Memphis, Tampa express interest in Buffalo Bills |agency=Associated Press |date=January 15, 1971 |page=14 }}</ref> Western New York leaders acquiesced to Wilson's demands and built a new open-air facility that featured a capacity of over 80,000 (at Wilson's request) and, unlike other stadiums, was built into the ground. [[New Era Field|Rich Stadium]] (later Ralph Wilson Stadium, now New Era Field) opened in 1973 and continues to house the Bills to this day (both Seattle and Tampa would get NFL teams of their own in 1976, when the [[Seattle Seahawks|Seahawks]] and [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], respectively, were enfranchised).\n\n[[1973 NFL season|1973]] was a season of change: [[Joe Ferguson]] became their new quarterback, they moved into a new stadium, Simpson recorded a 2,000-yard season and was voted NFL MVP, and the team had its first winning record since [[1966 American Football League season|1966]] with eight wins. The \"Electric Company\" of Simpson, [[Jim Braxton]], [[Paul Seymour (football player)|Paul Seymour]], and [[Joe DeLamielleure]] as recounted in the locally recorded hit \"Turn on the Juice\", lead a dramatic turnaround on the field. The \"Electric Company\" was the offensive line (OG [[Reggie McKenzie (guard)|Reggie McKenzie]], OT [[Dave Foley (American football)|Dave Foley]], C [[Mike Montler]], OG [[Joe DeLamielleure]] and OT [[Donnie Green]]) which provided the electricity for the \"Juice\". O.J. became the only player to rush for 2,000 yards prior to the institution of the 16-game season in 1978. The team made the NFL playoffs at 9\u20135 for the first time in history in [[1974 NFL season|1974]], but in their divisional playoff, they lost to the eventual [[Super Bowl IX|Super Bowl]] champions, the [[1974 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]].\n\nAfter an 8\u20136 [[1975 NFL season|1975 season]], the [[1976 Buffalo Bills season|Bills]] had internal troubles in [[1976 NFL season|1976]]; Ferguson was injured and [[Gary Marangi]] proved ineffective in replacement. The team dropped to the bottom of the AFC East at 2\u201312, where they stayed for the rest of the 1970s. On a high note, the 1976 [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day game]] saw Simpson set the league record for rushing yards in a game, despite a 27\u201314 loss to the [[1976 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]]. After the [[1977 NFL season|1977 season]], Simpson was traded to the [[San Francisco 49ers]].\n\n===1978\u20131983: The Chuck Knox-Kay Stephenson era===\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 30 - Joe Cribbs (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Bills' running back Joe Cribbs (''middle'') rushes the ball against the Jets in the 1981 AFC Wild Card game.]]\n[[1980 NFL season|1980]] marked the 3rd year the Bills were good. They beat the archrival [[1980 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] for the first time in 11 years in their season opener, en route to an 11\u20135 season and their first AFC East title. However, they lost to the [[1980 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] 20\u201314 in the divisional playoffs.  In 1981, the Bills made the playoffs as a wild-card team with a 10\u20136 record.  They defeated the [[1981 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] 31\u201327 in the wild card round of the playoffs, but lost in the divisional round to the eventual AFC champion [[1981 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]], 28\u201321. The following year \u2014 the [[1982 NFL strike|strike-shortened]] season of [[1982 NFL season|1982]] \u2014 the [[1982 Buffalo Bills season|Bills]] slipped to a 4\u20135 final record and missed the playoffs. In the famous [[1983 NFL Draft|1983 draft]], the Bills selected quarterback [[Jim Kelly]] as their replacement to an aging [[Joe Ferguson]], but Kelly decided to play in the upstart [[United States Football League]] instead. \n\n===1984\u20131985: To the brink of collapse===\n[[Chuck Knox]] left his coaching position to take a job with the [[Seattle Seahawks]], and running back [[Joe Cribbs]] also defected to the USFL, a loss incoming head coach [[Kay Stephenson]] unsuccessfully attempted to stop in court. In a 1984 article in ''The Buffalo News'' announcing [[Greg Bell (American football)|Greg Bell]]'s signing with the Bills, owner Ralph Wilson stated that the team was not yet in jeopardy, but that attendance would have to remain high, and television revenues would have to continue coming in for the team to survive. In [[1984 NFL season|1984]] and [[1985 NFL season|1985]], the Bills went 2\u201314. By this point, attendance at Rich Stadium had fallen to under 30,000 fans per game for most of the 1985 season, leaving the team's long-term future in doubt. Wilson was fielding offers, including one from [[Leonard Tose]] to trade the Bills for the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/news/2017/12/11/buffalo-eagles-philadelphia-bills-it-might-have.html|first=James|last=Fink|title=Buffalo Eagles?

The Bills were favorites to beat the [[1990 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] (whom they had beaten on the road during the regular season), but the defensive plan laid out by Giants coach [[Bill Parcells]] and defensive coordinator [[Bill Belichick]] kept Buffalo in check (and without the ball) for much of the game. The game featured many lead changes, and with the score 20\u201319 in favor of New York with eight seconds left, Bills kicker [[Scott Norwood]] attempted a 47-yard field goal.

In what became known as [[The Comeback (American football)|The Comeback]], the Bills rallied behind Reich, taking the lead late in the 4th quarter and winning the game in overtime 41\u201338. The 35\u20133 deficit remains, to this day, the largest deficit (32 points) overcome to win a game in NFL history. Buffalo then defeated the [[1992 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] 24\u20133 in the divisional playoff and upset the archrival Dolphins 29\u201310 in the AFC Championship to advance to their third straight Super Bowl. [[Super Bowl XXVII]], played against the [[1992 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], turned out to be a mismatch. Buffalo committed a Super Bowl-record 9 turnovers en route to a 52\u201317 loss, becoming the first team in NFL history to lose three consecutive Super Bowls. One of the sole bright spots for the Bills was Don Beebe's rundown and strip of Leon Lett after Lett had returned a fumble inside the Bills' 5-yard line and was on his way to scoring.  Lett started celebrating too early and held the ball out long enough for Beebe, who had made up a considerable distance to get to Lett, to knock it out of his hand.  The play resulted in a touchback, not a touchdown, thus stopping Dallas from breaking the record for most points scored by a team in a Super Bowl (55), which was set [[Super Bowl XXIV|three years earlier\n]] and is still held today by the San Francisco 49ers.\n\n====1993====\n{{main|1993 Buffalo Bills season}}\n\nThe Bills won the AFC East championship in [[1993 NFL season|1993]] with a 12\u20134 record, and again won playoff games against the [[1993 Los Angeles Raiders season|Los Angeles Raiders]] and [[1993 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]], setting up a rematch with the [[1993 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] in [[Super Bowl XXVIII]] on January 30, 1994. The Bills became the only team ever to play in four straight Super Bowls, and in this game became the first team to face the same team in 2 straight Super Bowls, and looked ready to finally win one when they led at halftime. A Thurman Thomas fumble returned for a touchdown by [[James Washington]] tied the game, with Super Bowl MVP [[Emmitt Smith]] taking over the rest of the game for the Cowboys and the Bills were stunned again, 30\u201313.\n\n===1994\u20131997: Decline===\nThe four consecutive failures to win the title game, despite a 14\u20132 regular-season record against the NFC, inspired many jokes.

He goes, 'Do you know what Bills stands for?' and I've heard it a hundred times. I go, 'No, what?'

The expansion [[Carolina Panthers]] ended up selecting several key Bills contributors (backup quarterback [[Frank Reich]], wide receiver [[Don Beebe]] and tight end [[Pete Metzelaars]]) in the [[1995 NFL Expansion Draft|expansion draft]], where they formed the core of that team's inaugural roster.\n\nThe Bills again made the [[NFL playoffs, 1995-96|playoffs]] with a 10\u20136 record, and defeated [[1995 Miami Dolphins season|Miami]] in the wild card round.

The Bills still made the playoffs as the Wild Card home team; they became the first victim of the cinderella [[1996 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jacksonville Jaguars]], the first (and as of the present only) visiting team ever to win a playoff game at Rich Stadium. Jim Kelly retired after the season after the Bills management told him they were moving in a new direction and wanted him to help develop a younger QB to take over, signaling an end to the most successful era in Bills history. Thurman Thomas gave way to new running back [[Antowain Smith]]. Kelly's loss was felt in [[1997 Buffalo Bills season|1997]], when his replacement [[Todd Collins (quarterback)|Todd Collins]] faltered and the [[1997 Buffalo Bills season|Bills]] stumbled to 6\u201310. Coach [[Marv Levy]] retired after the season.\n\n===1998\u20132000: The Wade Phillips-Doug Flutie era===\n\n====1998====\n{{main|1998 Buffalo Bills season}}\n\n[[File:Dougflutie.JPG|thumb|right|[[Doug Flutie]] quarterbacked the Bills for three years, including the last two playoff appearances before the team's lengthy absence from the postseason, amid controversy.]] The Bills, under new coach [[Wade Phillips]] signed two [[quarterback]]s for the [[1998 NFL season|1998 season]], one that Buffalo traded a high first round pick for, and one that was signed as almost an afterthought. The former was for Jaguars backup [[Rob Johnson (American football)|Rob Johnson]] and the latter was former [[Heisman Trophy]] winner and [[Canadian Football League]] star [[Doug Flutie]]. Despite many Bills fans wanting Flutie to get the starting job after Flutie looked the better of the two QBs in camp and in preseason, Phillips named Johnson to the position. The Bills stumbled to begin the season 0\u20133, and after Johnson suffered a rib injury against the [[1998 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]], Flutie came in and led the Bills to a playoff spot and a 10\u20136 record. They faltered in their first playoff game against the [[1998 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]].\n\n====1999====\n{{main|1999 Buffalo Bills season}}\n\nFlutie's popularity continued into the [[1999 NFL season|1999 season]], with the Bills finishing 11\u20135, two games behind the [[1999 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] in the [[AFC East]] standings. Wade Phillips gave Rob Johnson the starting quarterback job in the first round playoff game against the [[1999 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]] even though Flutie had won 10 games and had gotten the Bills into the playoffs. The Bills scored a field goal with 16 seconds left to give them a 16\u201315 lead. But the Titans won the game on a controversial play that became to be known as the \"[[Music City Miracle]]\": During the ensuing kickoff, [[Frank Wycheck]] lateraled the ball to [[Kevin Dyson]] who then scored the winning [[touchdown]]. Although Wycheck's pass was close to an illegal [[forward lateral]], replays were ruled inconclusive and the call on the field was upheld as a touchdown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/6908433 |accessdate=March 10, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312040731/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/6908433 |archivedate=March 12, 2007 }}</ref> The Titans went on to advance to the [[Super Bowl XXXIV|Super Bowl]]. Until 2018, this was the last appearance by the Bills in the postseason.\n\n====2000====\n{{main|2000 Buffalo Bills season}}\n\nThe final ties to the Bills' Super Bowl years were severed in [[2000 NFL season|2000]], when Thurman Thomas, Andre Reed and Bruce Smith were all cut. [[Antowain Smith]], [[Eric Moulds]], and [[Marcellus Wiley]] respectively had long since eclipsed them on the depth chart. After an 8\u20138 season, and the team still caught up in the Johnson vs. Flutie controversy, general manager [[John Butler (American football general manager)|John Butler]] departed for the [[San Diego Chargers]]\u2014and took Flutie and Wiley with him, among many other Bills contributors. Doug Flutie left the Bills with a .677 winning percentage in 31 starts. Antowain Smith also left as a free agent for the New England Patriots, where he was the starting running back on their first two Super Bowl championship teams. Both Flutie and Smith were dominant in their final game as Bills, in a 42\u201323 victory over the [[2000 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]]. Thomas would be quickly replaced by rookie [[Travis Henry]].\n\n==2001\u20132014: The Playoff Drought and Ralph Wilson's final years==\n\n===2001\u20132004: The Tom Donahoe era===\nIn 2001, following the departure of John Butler, team owner Ralph Wilson announced his retirement as president of the organization and handed the reins of his franchise to [[Tom Donahoe]], a former executive with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. The move turned out to be disastrous. Donahoe (just a year after the team had released three eventual Hall of Famers in a salary cap move) proceeded to gut the franchise of most of its remaining recognizable talent and replaced it with young, inexperienced, unknown lower-end players, much of which joined Butler in San Diego that year, and installed [[Rob Johnson (American football)|Rob Johnson]] as the starting quarterback. The team went from playoff contenders to a 31\u201349 record during Donahoe's five-year tenure.\n\n====2001====\n{{main|2001 Buffalo Bills season}}\nTitans defensive coordinator [[Gregg Williams]] took over as head coach for the [[2001 NFL season|2001 season]], which proved to be the worst in recent memory for the Bills. [[Rob Johnson (American football)|Rob Johnson]] went down in mid-season with an injury and [[Alex Van Pelt]] took over. Buffalo finished 3\u201313. The Bills even lost a much-hyped mid-season match up with \"Bills West\" (the Flutie-led [[2001 San Diego Chargers season|Chargers]]). After the season, they traded for quarterback [[Drew Bledsoe]], deemed expendable by the Patriots after [[Tom Brady]] led them to a [[Super Bowl XXXVI|Super Bowl]] victory.\n\n====2002\u201303====\n{{main|2002 Buffalo Bills season|2003 Buffalo Bills season}}\n\nBledsoe revived the [[2002 Buffalo Bills season|Bills]] for the [[2002 NFL season|2002 season]], leading them to an 8\u20138 record, setting 10 team passing records in the process. However, in a tough division with all other teams finishing 9\u20137, they were still in last place. Another Patriots castoff, safety [[Lawyer Milloy]], who joined the Bills days before the [[2003 NFL season|2003 season]] began, gave the team an immediate boost on defense. After beating eventual champions [[2003 New England Patriots season|New England]] 31\u20130 in the first game, and crushing the [[2003 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jaguars]] in their second game, play-by-play announcer [[Van Miller]] immediately announced his retirement as of the end of the season, expecting the team to have a shot at the title. However, the [[2003 Buffalo Bills season|Bills]] stumbled through the rest of the season, finishing 6\u201310. In fact their season had ended the exact opposite of the beginning as they were trounced by New England 31\u20130. In one game, however, the Bills' fans gained a small measure of satisfaction when the defense sacked Rob Johnson multiple times in his relief effort for the [[2003 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]].\n\n====2004====\n{{main|2004 Buffalo Bills season}}\n\n[[File:Losman.JPG|thumb|right|J. P. Losman was one of several unsuccessful Bills quarterbacks in the 2000s.]] Gregg Williams was fired as head coach after the 2003 season and replaced with [[Mike Mularkey]]. The Bills also drafted another quarterback, [[J. P. Losman]], to be used if Bledsoe continued to struggle in [[2004 NFL season|2004]]. Unfortunately, Losman broke his leg in the pre-season and missed most of the regular season, seeing very limited action.\n\nBledsoe continued to struggle in [[2004 NFL season|2004]]. The Bills started the 2004 season 0\u20134, with Bledsoe and his offense struggling in their run-first offense, averaging only 13 points per game. Additionally, each loss was heartbreakingly close. The team finally managed to turn things around with a victory at home against the also winless [[2004 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]]. This, along with the emergence of [[Willis McGahee]] (a first round-pick and a gamble by the Bills due to the knee injury that McGahee suffered in his last college game) taking over the starting running back role from the injured [[Travis Henry]], and emergence of [[Lee Evans (American football)|Lee Evans]] to give the Bills a second deep threat, sparked the Bills to go 9\u20132 in their next eleven games. This string of victories allowed the Bills to be in the hunt for a final AFC wildcard playoff spot. Though they would lose to the [[2004 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] in the final game of the season, costing them a playoff berth and devastating the fans, the late season surge gave the team a positive direction to approach 2005.\n\nAfter the season, wanting to go in a younger direction and unhappy with [[Drew Bledsoe]]'s overall performance, the Bills decided to hand the starting quarterback reins to [[J. P. Losman]]. This angered Bledsoe, who demanded his release, which the Bills granted. Bledsoe then signed with the [[Dallas Cowboys]], reuniting him with his former [[New England Patriots]] coach [[Bill Parcells]].\n\n===2005\u20132007: Marv Levy returns to the fold===\n\n====2005====\n{{main|2005 Buffalo Bills season}}\n\nLosman's development did not proceed as quickly as the Bills had hoped it would. He began the [[2005 NFL season|2005 season]] 1\u20133 as a starter, prompting [[Kelly Holcomb]] to replace him. Losman would not see action again until Holcomb was injured in Week 10 against the [[2005 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]]. He led the [[2005 Buffalo Bills season|Bills]] to a win in that game, but would again be replaced by Holcomb after losing the next several games. Perhaps the low point of Losman's season was a 24\u201323 loss to the [[2005 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]], a game in which Buffalo led 21\u20130 and 23\u20133, but gave up 21 unanswered points in the 4th quarter. Buffalo's 2005 campaign resulted in a 5\u201311 record and the firing of General Manager [[Tom Donahoe]] in January 2006. Marv Levy was named as his replacement, with hopes that he would improve a franchise that failed to make the playoffs during Donahoe's tenure. That same month, Mike Mularkey resigned as head coach, citing family reasons along with disagreement over the direction of the organization. [[Dick Jauron]] was hired as his replacement.\n\n====2006\u201307: Dick Jauron becomes coach====\n{{main|2006 Buffalo Bills season|2007 Buffalo Bills season}}\n[[File:Anthony Thomas and Shaud Williams.jpg|thumb|right|The Buffalo Bills' uniforms from 2001 to 2010.]] The [[2006 NFL season|2006]] and [[2007 NFL season|2007 seasons]] both brought 7\u20139 records under Jauron's coaching, having been eliminated from playoff contention in December in both years. 2006 saw the additions of [[Donte Whitner]], [[Ko Simpson]], [[Ashton Youboty]], [[Anthony Hargrove]] and [[Kyle Williams (defensive tackle)|Kyle Williams]] to the defensive corps while 2007 brought in [[Trent Edwards]] to quarterback the offense, rookie first-round draft pick [[Marshawn Lynch]], second-round pick [[Paul Posluszny]], offensive linemen [[Derrick Dockery]] and [[Langston Walker]], and backup running back [[Fred Jackson (American football)|Fred Jackson]]. [[J. P. Losman]] played all 16 games in 2006 but was benched in early 2007 in favor of Edwards.\n\nAt the end of the 2007 season, Levy retired once again, citing the fact that he had reached the end of his two-year contract. Meanwhile, offensive coordinator [[Steve Fairchild]], a frequent fan target for the Bills' offensive woes, was hired as head coach of [[Colorado State University]]'s [[Colorado State Rams football|football program]]. Offensive line coach [[Jim McNally]] retired shortly after the end of the season. All of those positions were filled from within, with [[Turk Schonert]] promoted to offensive coordinator.\n\n===2008\u201309: Toronto and Terrell Owens===\n\n====2008====\n{{main|2008 Buffalo Bills season}}\n\nOne of the most notable moves in the league occurred during the 2008 offseason, when league officials approved an [[Bills Toronto Series|October 2007 proposal]] by Bills owner Ralph Wilson to lease his team to Canadian media mogul [[Edward Samuel Rogers|Edward S. \"Ted\" Rogers, Jr.]] to play an annual [[National Football League in Toronto|regular season game and a biennial preseason game]] in Toronto, Ontario, Canada's [[Rogers Centre]] over the next five years, in exchange for a sum of C$78,000,000 cash. The games began during the [[2008 NFL season|2008 season]]. Notable additions to the roster for 2008 include linebacker [[Kawika Mitchell]], acquired as a free agent from the defending Super Bowl champion [[New York Giants]], and defensive tackle [[Marcus Stroud]], in addition to draft picks, cornerback [[Leodis McKelvin]] and wide receiver [[James Hardy (American football)|James Hardy]]. The Bills started extremely well that season, starting out with a 5\u20131 record before their bye week and showing promise in Trent Edwards as finally being a capable quarterback for the Bills. However, Edwards suffered a concussion from a brutal hit in a game against the [[Arizona Cardinals]]. The team then went 2\u20138 in their last games, earning them another 7\u20139 record, which then resulted in the longest active streak of missed playoffs at the time.\n\n====2009====\n[[File:Brian Moorman, October 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Punter [[Brian Moorman]], who was named to the [[National_Football_League_2000s_All-Decade_Team|NFL's 2000s All-Decade team]], was one of the team's few bright spots during this decade]]\n{{main|2009 Buffalo Bills season}}\n\nOn March 7, [[2009 NFL season|2009]] the Buffalo Bills made a major splash in the free agency market when it acquired veteran wide receiver [[Terrell Owens]], who had recently been released by the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. Owens, who was signed to a one-year deal, was infamous for his elaborate touchdown celebrations and controversies with past teammates despite being a superstar player. In addition, former starting quarterback J. P. Losman, by this point relegated to third string behind Trent Edwards and [[Gibran Hamdan]], was allowed to become a free agent. In the first round of the [[2009 NFL Draft]], the Bills selected defensive end/linebacker [[Aaron Maybin]] from [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]] with the 11th overall pick and center [[Eric Wood]] of [[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville]] with the 28th overall pick. Buffalo also selected free safety [[Jarius Byrd]] of Oregon, guard [[Andy Levitre]] of Oregon State, tight end [[Shawn Nelson (American football)|Shawn Nelson]] of Southern Mississippi, and cornerbacks [[Cary Harris]] of USC and [[Ellis Lankster]] of West Virginia.  \n\nAs the season began, Terrell Owens proved to disappoint for most of the season, and the offensive line suffered from severe turnover, leading the team to stumble to a 3\u20136 start, after which the Bills fired head coach [[Dick Jauron]] midseason. Overall, Owens' stats for 2009 were modest: 829 yards and five TDs. The season opener against [[2009 New England Patriots season|New England]] was a loss, although Buffalo's morale was raised by the fact that it was only by a single point. Other notable games included a 16\u201313 OT victory over the [[2009 New York Jets season|Jets]] in Week 6, and the Week 10 game against [[2009 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee]], where Titans owner Bud Adams made an [[the finger|obscene gesture]] at Bills fans and was fined $250,000. The Week 13 game against the Jets was an international series match held across the border in Toronto. In Week 15, the Bills hosted New England, but despite optimistic predictions, fell 17\u201310, marking the fifth season in a row where they lost both matches against the Patriots. This completely eliminated Buffalo from playoff contention and marked their tenth consecutive season without a playoff appearance. On the season ender, they \"routed\" the 14\u20131 [[2009 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] 30\u20137 to end the year at 6\u201310; however, Colts quarterback [[Peyton Manning]] was benched early due to this being a meaningless game for the playoff-bound Colts. \n\nQuarterback Trent Edwards battled injury throughout the whole season with his play regressing throughout the weeks, splitting games with back-up [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]], formerly of the Cincinnati Bengals. The Bills were hit with another hard blow when star running back Marshawn Lynch was given a three-game suspension by NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] for pleading guilty to misdemeanor weapons charges. Though back-up running back Fred Jackson did quite well in Lynch's absence, his performance then hindered on Lynch's return but he still had a 1,000-yard rushing season. However, the performance of free safety Jarius Byrd showed extreme promise as Byrd led the NFL with 9 interceptions and was selected to the [[2010 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]].\n\n===2010\u20132012: The Buddy Nix/Chan Gailey Era===\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 200\n   | footer    = The \"big three\" of Chan Gailey's surprisingly efficient offense consisted of former late-round draft picks or undrafted players.

One of his first personnel moves was to cut ties with Owens (ironically, a man he had recruited during his time in college football).\n\nOn January 20, the team named [[Chan Gailey]] as head coach.  Gailey was previously the offensive coordinator of Kansas City and head coach of Georgia Tech and the Dallas Cowboys, going 8\u20130 in the division in 1998, and leading the team to the postseason in both 1998 and 1999.\n\nWith the expiration of Terrell Owens' contract in March 2010, the Bills chose not to re-sign him.\n\nAs 2010 began, the Bills lost to Miami at home. After going 0\u20134, the Bills released [[Trent Edwards]] and named Ryan Fitzpatrick starting quarterback.  Despite some close games, they ended up at an 0\u20138 record before beating Detroit at home in Week 10. Then came a 49\u201331 win in Cincinnati and an OT loss to Pittsburgh. The team finished 2010 with a 4\u201312 record.\n\n====2011====\n{{main|2011 Buffalo Bills season}}\nThe Bills fired [[Tom Modrak]], one of the last connections to the Donahoe era, shortly after the [[2011 NFL Draft]]. As a result of the Bills' poor play in 2010, the team earned the third overall selection in said draft, using it to select defensive tackle [[Marcell Dareus]] in an effort to improve the team's long-struggling run defense.\n\nBuffalo had an excellent start to 2011, routing [[2011 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City]] 41\u20137. The following week, they hosted Oakland and erased a 21\u20133 deficit, winning 38\u201335. In week 3, the Bills hosted the Patriots; they erased a 21-0 Patriots lead and led 31\u201324 in the fourth; a late [[Tom Brady]] touchdown tied the game, but the Bills whipped into range of a last second field goal.  The 34\u201331 win ended a 15-game franchise losing streak spanning 8 years to the Patriots. Despite starting the 2011 season with a 5\u20132 record, leading the AFC East for several weeks, a wave of injuries to several key starters led to the Bills compiling a 7-game losing streak, pushing the team out of playoff contention for the twelfth straight year. The losing streak was finally broken with a defeat of the [[Tim Tebow]]-led Denver Broncos on Christmas Eve, in a game that had unusually poor attendance.\n\n====2012====\n{{main|2012 Buffalo Bills season}}\nOn March 15, 2012, defensive end and former first-overall pick [[Mario Williams]], formerly of the [[Houston Texans]], signed a six-year contract with the Bills worth up to $100 million ($49.5 million guaranteed), which made it the most lucrative contract for a defensive player in NFL history at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7690355/buffalo-bills-agree-deal-mario-williams |title=Bills, Mario Williams agree to deal |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=March 15, 2012 |accessdate=November 15, 2013}}</ref> Unfortunately, it was not enough to prevent another disappointing season in 2012 in which the Bills finished 6\u201310 again.

After the draft, Nix announced his resignation; [[Doug Whaley]] moved into the general manager position. A knee injury to Manuel and a season-ending concussion to Kolb almost forced the team to start undrafted rookie [[Jeff Tuel]] as their opening day starting quarterback; Manuel nonetheless recovered in time to start week 1 only to injure his other knee a few weeks later, which resulted in the signing of [[Thad Lewis]] (who himself had started a game as an undrafted rookie the previous year with the Cleveland Browns).

The club joined the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as part of the [[1970 NFL season|1970]] [[AFL-NFL merger]]. The Bills have the distinction of being the only team to advance to four consecutive [[Super Bowl]]s between 1990 and 1993, but also the dubious distinction of losing all four of them.\n\nThe second NFL team to represent [[Buffalo, New York]], the Bills were founded by [[Ralph Wilson]], who owned the team from its establishment until his death in 2014. The team was then sold to [[Terrence Pegula]] and his wife [[Kim Pegula|Kim]] later that year.\n\n==Professional football in Buffalo before 1960==\n\nThe Bills were not the first professional football team to play in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], nor was it the first NFL team in the region. Professional football had been played in Buffalo and in upstate New York since the beginning of the 20th century. In 1915, [[Barney Lepper]]'s \"[[Buffalo (1920s NFL teams)|Buffalo All-Stars]]\" were founded; the team would later be replaced by the Niagaras in 1918, then the Prospects in 1919. The Prospects were the basis of what would become the \"Buffalo All-Americans,\" who joined what would become the NFL in 1920. After changing their name to the Bisons in 1924 (and, for one season, the Rangers in 1926), the team suspended operations in 1927, then came back in 1929 and re-folded at the end of that season.\n\nAfter Buffalo hosted two NFL games in 1938 (a practice that would become a semi-regular occurrence in the city until the current team's arrival), the [[American Football League (1940)|third American Football League]] installed the [[Buffalo Indians]] in the city; the Indians played two years before the league suspended and ultimately folded due to World War II. After the war, when the [[All-America Football Conference]] formed, Buffalo was again selected for a team; originally known as the ''Buffalo Bisons,'' the same name as a [[Buffalo Bisons|baseball team]] and (at the time) a [[Buffalo Bisons (AHL)|hockey team]] in the area, the team sought a new identity and named itself the \"[[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|Buffalo Bills]]\" in 1947. When the AAFC merged with the NFL in 1950, the AAFC Bills were merged into the [[Cleveland Browns]]. Though there was no connection between the AAFC team and the current team, the Bills name proved popular enough that it was used as the namesake for the future [[American Football League]] team that would form in 1959.\n\nThe forerunners to the [[Canadian Football League]] would also play at least one game in Buffalo in 1951.\n\n==1960\u20131985==\n===Bringing pro football back to Buffalo===\n[[File:War_Memorial_Stadium_Rockpile.JPG|left|250px|thumb|The remains of [[War Memorial Stadium (Buffalo)|War Memorial Stadium]], used as the home field of the [[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|AAFC Bills]] and the first home for the current team]]\nWhen [[Lamar Hunt]] announced the formation of the American Football League in the summer of 1959, Buffalo was one of the target cities Hunt sought. His first choice of owner, however, turned him down; [[Pat McGroder]] (then a liquor store owner and sports liaison with the city of Buffalo) was still hopeful that the threat of the AFL would prompt the NFL to come back to Buffalo to try to stop the AFL from gaining a foothold there (as the NFL would do with teams in Minnesota, Dallas, St. Louis and later Atlanta). McGroder's hopes never came to fruition, and in 1961, he took a position in the new Bills organization.\n\n[[Harry Wismer]], who was to own the [[New York Jets|Titans of New York]] franchise, reached out to insurance salesman and automobile heir [[Ralph Wilson|Ralph C. Wilson, Jr.]] to see if he was interested in joining the upstart league. (Both Wismer and Wilson were minority owners of NFL franchises at the time: Wilson part-owned the [[Detroit Lions]], while Wismer was a small partner in the [[Washington Redskins]] but had little power due to majority owner [[George Preston Marshall]]'s near-iron fist over the team and the league). Wilson agreed to field a team in the new league, with the words \"Count me in. I'll take a franchise anywhere you suggest.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1134343/index.htm |accessdate=September 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026074333/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1134343/index.htm |archivedate=October 26, 2012 }}</ref> Hunt gave him the choice of six cities: Miami, Buffalo, [[Cincinnati]], [[Saint Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Atlanta]], or [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. Wilson's first choice was Miami, but city officials there were wary of an upstart league after the failure of the [[Miami Seahawks]] over a decade prior and rejected the idea. (Once the AFL established itself, the city reversed its stance and allowed the [[Miami Dolphins]] to reside in the city.) In WWII, Ralph Wilson served aboard a minesweeper, the YMS-29, serving in the Mediterranean.  Wilson was an executive officer to the ship's captain, Buffalo native George E. Schaaf. Wilson remembered the Buffalo team in the old NFL and remembered his old ship's captain was from Buffalo.  Ralph Wilson reached out to the General Construction Contractor, George E. Schaaf who still resided there. Schaaf assured Wilson that pro-football interest was significant in Buffalo and assembled a coalition of key Buffalo figures who were able to interest Wilson in bringing the AFL franchise to Buffalo. Attorney Paul Crotty (father of [[Paul A. Crotty]] and a powerful Buffalo political figure) negotiated a sweetheart deal with [[War Memorial Stadium (Buffalo)|Civic Stadium]] in Buffalo, offering Wilson full control of the venue and a deep discount on rent. Their efforts to lobby Wilson to come to Buffalo were successful, and Wilson sent Hunt a telegram with the now-famous words, \"Count me in with Buffalo.\" <ref> Buffalo News 10/17/59 - Buffalo News 10/24/59 - Buffalo Bills Media Guide, 1960 - NY Journal 8/22/60 - Buffalo Bills Media Guide 1964.</ref>\n\n===The AFL years===\n[[File:Jack_Kemp_1961.jpg|thumb|right|The Bills signed former Chargers quarterback [[Jack Kemp]], who would lead Buffalo to back-to-back AFL Championship titles in the 1960s]]\n\nThe Buffalo Bills were a charter member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL) in [[1960 American Football League season|1960]]. After a public contest, the team adopted the same name as the [[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|AAFC Buffalo Bills]], the former [[All-America Football Conference]] team in Buffalo. The AAFC Bills franchise was named after the [[Buffalo Bills (quartet)|Buffalo Bills]], a popular [[barbershop quartet]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.singers.com/barbershop/buffalobills.html |title=The Buffalo Bills Barbershop Quartet |author= |date= |publisher=Primarily A Cappella |accessdate=6 August 2012}}</ref> whose name was a play on the name of the famed Wild West showman [[Buffalo Bill Cody]]. The franchises are not officially related, other than in name, to each other.\n\nAfter an inaugural season that saw the Bills finish 5\u20138\u20131 (third in the four-team AFL East Division), the Bills gained four of the first five picks in the 1961 AFL draft, including the top slot, which they used to draft offensive tackle [[Ken Rice (American football)|Ken Rice]]. They also drafted guard [[Billy Shaw]] in the same draft. Success did not come overnight. On August 8, [[1961 American Football League season|1961]], the Bills became the first (and only) [[American Football League]] team to play a [[Canadian Football League]] team, the nearby [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]]. Because of that game, they also hold the dubious distinction of being the only current NFL team to have ever lost to a CFL team, as the Tiger-Cats won, 38\u201321. Hamilton was one of the best teams in the CFL (they would go on to win the Big Four title but lose in the [[49th Grey Cup]] that year), and Buffalo, at the time, was the worst team in the AFL.\n\nIn the 1962 offseason, Buffalo began to get good players for the first time in franchise history. [[Jack Kemp]] was acquired off waivers from the [[San Diego Chargers]] after the Chargers thought Kemp, who had led the Chargers to back-to-back AFL title games, had a bum hand. The Bills also drafted [[Syracuse Orange football|Syracuse]] running back phenomenon [[Ernie Davis]] and had a serious chance of getting him to play for Buffalo after the Redskins, a team Davis refused to play for, drafted him; however, Davis instead opted to play for the NFL after the Redskins traded him to [[Cleveland Browns|Cleveland]], and he died of leukemia before playing a single down of professional football. Instead, the Bills then acquired one of the CFL's top running backs, [[Cookie Gilchrist]].\n\nOn December 14, 1963, the Bills and the [[New York Jets]] played the final game at the [[Polo Grounds]].<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/196312140nyj.htm |title=Buffalo Bills at New York Jets- December 14th, 1963 | author= |date= | publisher=Pro Football Reference |accessdate=2 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1963 to 1966, Buffalo experienced its first stretch of success, making the playoffs all four years and winning back-to-back AFL championships in [[1964 Buffalo Bills season|1964]] and [[1965 Buffalo Bills season|1965]] under head coach [[Lou Saban]]. The Bills made it to a third straight AFL championship game in [[1966 American Football League season|1966]], with the winner representing the AFL in the first [[Super Bowl I|AFL-NFL World Championship Game]], later known as ''Super Bowl I''. However, they lost to the [[1966 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]], who went on to play the [[1966 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]]. \n\nOffensive lineman [[Bob Kalsu]] quit the team after his [[1968 American Football League season|1968]] rookie season to serve in the [[Vietnam War]]. He never returned; Kalsu was killed in action in 1970 and is often cited by Bills fans as the first professional football player to die in action in war during his playing career. This is not true, as [[Young Bussey]] and [[Jack Lummus]] were still of playing age when they left the NFL to serve in [[World War II]] and were killed in action a few years later. Kalsu would be the only NFL player to lose his life in Vietnam.\n\nThe [[1968 American Football League season|1968 season]] was a tumultuous one. With starter Jack Kemp injured, Buffalo resorted to converting wide receiver [[Ed Rutkowski]] to quarterback in a rotation with Rutkowski, [[Kay Stephenson]] and [[Dan Darragh]]. The result was disastrous, and the [[1968 Buffalo Bills season|Bills]] once again dropped to last in the league, resulting in the Bills earning the first overall draft pick in what was now the combined [[1969 NFL Draft|AFL-NFL draft]]. The Bills selected [[O. J. Simpson]] with their pick.\n\n===1969\u20131977: The O.J. Simpson-\"Electric Company\" era===\n{{see also|Electric Company (football)}}\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 29 - O.J. Simpson (O.J. Simpson crop).jpg|thumb|right|[[O. J. Simpson]], the face of the Bills franchise for most of the 1970s, pictured breaking the NFL's single-season rushing record in 1973.]] Before the [[1969 American Football League season|1969 season]], the Bills drafted running back [[O. J. Simpson]], who would become the face of the franchise through the 1970s. The NFL-AFL merger placed Buffalo in the AFC East division with the Patriots, Dolphins, Jets, and Colts. Their first season in the NFL saw the team win only three games, lose ten, and tie one. In [[1971 NFL season|1971]], not only did the [[1971 Buffalo Bills season|Bills]] finish in sole possession of the NFL's worst overall record at 1\u201313, but they also scored the fewest points (184) in the league that year while allowing the most (394); no NFL team has since done all three of those things in the same season in a non-strike year. They thus obtained the #1 draft pick for 1972, which was Notre Dame DE [[Walt Patulski]]. Despite good on-field performances, he struggled with injuries before being traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in 1976. [[Lou Saban]], who had coached the Bills' AFL championship teams, was re-hired in [[1972 NFL season|1972]], in which the team finished 4\u20139\u20131.\n\nMeanwhile, [[War Memorial Stadium (Buffalo)|War Memorial Stadium]] was in severe need of replacement, being in poor condition, located in an increasingly worsening neighborhood, and too small to meet the NFL's post-1969 requirement that all stadiums seat at least 50,000. Construction began on a new stadium in the suburbs after Ralph Wilson threatened to move the team to another city; at one point after the 1970 season Wilson was \u201cprepared to move the team\u201d to [[Husky Stadium]] in [[Seattle]] and was also fielding offers from Tampa and Memphis.<ref name=bmmttos>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gDMsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xMsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2588%2C1883967 |newspaper=Spartanburg (SC) Herald |agency=Associated Press |title=Bills may move team to Seattle |date=January 13, 1971 |page=10}}</ref><ref name=mtexp>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=19710115&id=ezMsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xMsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4930,2267693|newspaper=Spartanburg (SC) Herald |title=Memphis, Tampa express interest in Buffalo Bills |agency=Associated Press |date=January 15, 1971 |page=14 }}</ref> Western New York leaders acquiesced to Wilson's demands and built a new open-air facility that featured a capacity of over 80,000 (at Wilson's request) and, unlike other stadiums, was built into the ground. [[New Era Field|Rich Stadium]] (later Ralph Wilson Stadium, now New Era Field) opened in 1973 and continues to house the Bills to this day (both Seattle and Tampa would get NFL teams of their own in 1976, when the [[Seattle Seahawks|Seahawks]] and [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], respectively, were enfranchised).\n\n[[1973 NFL season|1973]] was a season of change: [[Joe Ferguson]] became their new quarterback, they moved into a new stadium, Simpson recorded a 2,000-yard season and was voted NFL MVP, and the team had its first winning record since [[1966 American Football League season|1966]] with eight wins. The \"Electric Company\" of Simpson, [[Jim Braxton]], [[Paul Seymour (football player)|Paul Seymour]], and [[Joe DeLamielleure]] as recounted in the locally recorded hit \"Turn on the Juice\", lead a dramatic turnaround on the field. The \"Electric Company\" was the offensive line (OG [[Reggie McKenzie (guard)|Reggie McKenzie]], OT [[Dave Foley (American football)|Dave Foley]], C [[Mike Montler]], OG [[Joe DeLamielleure]] and OT [[Donnie Green]]) which provided the electricity for the \"Juice\". O.J. became the only player to rush for 2,000 yards prior to the institution of the 16-game season in 1978. The team made the NFL playoffs at 9\u20135 for the first time in history in [[1974 NFL season|1974]], but in their divisional playoff, they lost to the eventual [[Super Bowl IX|Super Bowl]] champions, the [[1974 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]].\n\nAfter an 8\u20136 [[1975 NFL season|1975 season]], the [[1976 Buffalo Bills season|Bills]] had internal troubles in [[1976 NFL season|1976]]; Ferguson was injured and [[Gary Marangi]] proved ineffective in replacement. The team dropped to the bottom of the AFC East at 2\u201312, where they stayed for the rest of the 1970s. On a high note, the 1976 [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day game]] saw Simpson set the league record for rushing yards in a game, despite a 27\u201314 loss to the [[1976 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]]. After the [[1977 NFL season|1977 season]], Simpson was traded to the [[San Francisco 49ers]].\n\n===1978\u20131983: The Chuck Knox-Kay Stephenson era===\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 30 - Joe Cribbs (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Bills' running back Joe Cribbs (''middle'') rushes the ball against the Jets in the 1981 AFC Wild Card game.]]\n[[1980 NFL season|1980]] marked the 3rd year the Bills were good. They beat the archrival [[1980 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] for the first time in 11 years in their season opener, en route to an 11\u20135 season and their first AFC East title. However, they lost to the [[1980 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] 20\u201314 in the divisional playoffs.  In 1981, the Bills made the playoffs as a wild-card team with a 10\u20136 record.  They defeated the [[1981 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] 31\u201327 in the wild card round of the playoffs, but lost in the divisional round to the eventual AFC champion [[1981 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]], 28\u201321. The following year \u2014 the [[1982 NFL strike|strike-shortened]] season of [[1982 NFL season|1982]] \u2014 the [[1982 Buffalo Bills season|Bills]] slipped to a 4\u20135 final record and missed the playoffs. In the famous [[1983 NFL Draft|1983 draft]], the Bills selected quarterback [[Jim Kelly]] as their replacement to an aging [[Joe Ferguson]], but Kelly decided to play in the upstart [[United States Football League]] instead. \n\n===1984\u20131985: To the brink of collapse===\n[[Chuck Knox]] left his coaching position to take a job with the [[Seattle Seahawks]], and running back [[Joe Cribbs]] also defected to the USFL, a loss incoming head coach [[Kay Stephenson]] unsuccessfully attempted to stop in court. In a 1984 article in ''The Buffalo News'' announcing [[Greg Bell (American football)|Greg Bell]]'s signing with the Bills, owner Ralph Wilson stated that the team was not yet in jeopardy, but that attendance would have to remain high, and television revenues would have to continue coming in for the team to survive. In [[1984 NFL season|1984]] and [[1985 NFL season|1985]], the Bills went 2\u201314. By this point, attendance at Rich Stadium had fallen to under 30,000 fans per game for most of the 1985 season, leaving the team's long-term future in doubt. Wilson was fielding offers, including one from [[Leonard Tose]] to trade the Bills for the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/news/2017/12/11/buffalo-eagles-philadelphia-bills-it-might-have.html|first=James|last=Fink|title=Buffalo Eagles?

Midway through the [[1986 NFL season|1986 season]], the Bills fired coach [[Hank Bullough]] and replaced him with Levy, who in addition to the Blitz had also previously coached the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] and [[Montreal Alouettes]]. Levy and Polian put together a receiving game featuring [[Andre Reed]], a defense led by first-overall draft pick [[Bruce Smith (defensive end)|Bruce Smith]], and a top-flight offensive line, led by Hull along with [[Jim Ritcher]], [[Will Wolford]] and [[Howard Ballard|Howard \"House\" Ballard]].\n\nAfter the [[1987 NFL strike|strike year]] of [[1987 NFL season|1987]], in [[1988 NFL season|1988]], the rookie season of running back [[Thurman Thomas]], the [[1988 Buffalo Bills season|Bills]] went 12\u20134 and finished atop the AFC East for the first of four consecutive seasons.

The team finished 13\u20133, and behind their no-huddle attack, beat the [[1990 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] 44-34 and blew out the [[1990 Los Angeles Raiders season|Los Angeles Raiders]] 51\u20133 in the [[NFL playoffs, 1990-91|playoffs]] on their way to [[Super Bowl XXV]]. The Bills were favorites to beat the [[1990 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] (whom they had beaten on the road during the regular season), but the defensive plan laid out by Giants coach [[Bill Parcells]] and defensive coordinator [[Bill Belichick]] kept Buffalo in check (and without the ball) for much of the game. The game featured many lead changes, and with the score 20\u201319 in favor of New York with eight seconds left, Bills kicker [[Scott Norwood]] attempted a 47-yard field goal.

The Bills looked to avenge their heartbreaking Super Bowl loss a year earlier by playing the [[1991 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] in [[Super Bowl XXVI]], but it was not to be. The Redskins opened up a 17\u20130 halftime lead and never looked back, handing the Bills a 37\u201324 loss.

In what became known as [[The Comeback (American football)|The Comeback]], the Bills rallied behind Reich, taking the lead late in the 4th quarter and winning the game in overtime 41\u201338. The 35\u20133 deficit remains, to this day, the largest deficit (32 points) overcome to win a game in NFL history. Buffalo then defeated the [[1992 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] 24\u20133 in the divisional playoff and upset the archrival Dolphins 29\u201310 in the AFC Championship to advance to their third straight Super Bowl. [[Super Bowl XXVII]], played against the [[1992 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], turned out to be a mismatch. Buffalo committed a Super Bowl-record 9 turnovers en route to a 52\u201317 loss, becoming the first team in NFL history to lose three consecutive Super Bowls. One of the sole bright spots for the Bills was Don Beebe's rundown and strip of Leon Lett after Lett had returned a fumble inside the Bills' 5-yard line and was on his way to scoring.  Lett started celebrating too early and held the ball out long enough for Beebe, who had made up a considerable distance to get to Lett, to knock it out of his hand.  The play resulted in a touchback, not a touchdown, thus stopping Dallas from breaking the record for most points scored by a team in a Super Bowl (55), which was set [[Super Bowl XXIV|three years earlier\n]] and is still held today by the San Francisco 49ers.\n\n====1993====\n{{main|1993 Buffalo Bills season}}\n\nThe Bills won the AFC East championship in [[1993 NFL season|1993]] with a 12\u20134 record, and again won playoff games against the [[1993 Los Angeles Raiders season|Los Angeles Raiders]] and [[1993 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]], setting up a rematch with the [[1993 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] in [[Super Bowl XXVIII]] on January 30, 1994. The Bills became the only team ever to play in four straight Super Bowls, and in this game became the first team to face the same team in 2 straight Super Bowls, and looked ready to finally win one when they led at halftime.

The Bills still made the playoffs as the Wild Card home team; they became the first victim of the cinderella [[1996 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jacksonville Jaguars]], the first (and as of the present only) visiting team ever to win a playoff game at Rich Stadium. Jim Kelly retired after the season after the Bills management told him they were moving in a new direction and wanted him to help develop a younger QB to take over, signaling an end to the most successful era in Bills history. Thurman Thomas gave way to new running back [[Antowain Smith]]. Kelly's loss was felt in [[1997 Buffalo Bills season|1997]], when his replacement [[Todd Collins (quarterback)|Todd Collins]] faltered and the [[1997 Buffalo Bills season|Bills]] stumbled to 6\u201310.

Until 2018, this was the last appearance by the Bills in the postseason.\n\n====2000====\n{{main|2000 Buffalo Bills season}}\n\nThe final ties to the Bills' Super Bowl years were severed in [[2000 NFL season|2000]], when Thurman Thomas, Andre Reed and Bruce Smith were all cut. [[Antowain Smith]], [[Eric Moulds]], and [[Marcellus Wiley]] respectively had long since eclipsed them on the depth chart. After an 8\u20138 season, and the team still caught up in the Johnson vs. Flutie controversy, general manager [[John Butler (American football general manager)|John Butler]] departed for the [[San Diego Chargers]]\u2014and took Flutie and Wiley with him, among many other Bills contributors. Doug Flutie left the Bills with a .677 winning percentage in 31 starts. Antowain Smith also left as a free agent for the New England Patriots, where he was the starting running back on their first two Super Bowl championship teams. Both Flutie and Smith were dominant in their final game as Bills, in a 42\u201323 victory over the [[2000 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]]. Thomas would be quickly replaced by rookie [[Travis Henry]].\n\n==2001\u20132014: The Playoff Drought and Ralph Wilson's final years==\n\n===2001\u20132004: The Tom Donahoe era===\nIn 2001, following the departure of John Butler, team owner Ralph Wilson announced his retirement as president of the organization and handed the reins of his franchise to [[Tom Donahoe]], a former executive with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. The move turned out to be disastrous. Donahoe (just a year after the team had released three eventual Hall of Famers in a salary cap move) proceeded to gut the franchise of most of its remaining recognizable talent and replaced it with young, inexperienced, unknown lower-end players, much of which joined Butler in San Diego that year, and installed [[Rob Johnson (American football)|Rob Johnson]] as the starting quarterback. The team went from playoff contenders to a 31\u201349 record during Donahoe's five-year tenure.\n\n====2001====\n{{main|2001 Buffalo Bills season}}\nTitans defensive coordinator [[Gregg Williams]] took over as head coach for the [[2001 NFL season|2001 season]], which proved to be the worst in recent memory for the Bills. [[Rob Johnson (American football)|Rob Johnson]] went down in mid-season with an injury and [[Alex Van Pelt]] took over. Buffalo finished 3\u201313. The Bills even lost a much-hyped mid-season match up with \"Bills West\" (the Flutie-led [[2001 San Diego Chargers season|Chargers]]). After the season, they traded for quarterback [[Drew Bledsoe]], deemed expendable by the Patriots after [[Tom Brady]] led them to a [[Super Bowl XXXVI|Super Bowl]] victory.\n\n====2002\u201303====\n{{main|2002 Buffalo Bills season|2003 Buffalo Bills season}}\n\nBledsoe revived the [[2002 Buffalo Bills season|Bills]] for the [[2002 NFL season|2002 season]], leading them to an 8\u20138 record, setting 10 team passing records in the process. However, in a tough division with all other teams finishing 9\u20137, they were still in last place. Another Patriots castoff, safety [[Lawyer Milloy]], who joined the Bills days before the [[2003 NFL season|2003 season]] began, gave the team an immediate boost on defense. After beating eventual champions [[2003 New England Patriots season|New England]] 31\u20130 in the first game, and crushing the [[2003 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jaguars]] in their second game, play-by-play announcer [[Van Miller]] immediately announced his retirement as of the end of the season, expecting the team to have a shot at the title. However, the [[2003 Buffalo Bills season|Bills]] stumbled through the rest of the season, finishing 6\u201310. In fact their season had ended the exact opposite of the beginning as they were trounced by New England 31\u20130. In one game, however, the Bills' fans gained a small measure of satisfaction when the defense sacked Rob Johnson multiple times in his relief effort for the [[2003 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]].\n\n====2004====\n{{main|2004 Buffalo Bills season}}\n\n[[File:Losman.JPG|thumb|right|J. P. Losman was one of several unsuccessful Bills quarterbacks in the 2000s.]] Gregg Williams was fired as head coach after the 2003 season and replaced with [[Mike Mularkey]]. The Bills also drafted another quarterback, [[J. P. Losman]], to be used if Bledsoe continued to struggle in [[2004 NFL season|2004]]. Unfortunately, Losman broke his leg in the pre-season and missed most of the regular season, seeing very limited action.\n\nBledsoe continued to struggle in [[2004 NFL season|2004]]. The Bills started the 2004 season 0\u20134, with Bledsoe and his offense struggling in their run-first offense, averaging only 13 points per game. Additionally, each loss was heartbreakingly close. The team finally managed to turn things around with a victory at home against the also winless [[2004 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]]. This, along with the emergence of [[Willis McGahee]] (a first round-pick and a gamble by the Bills due to the knee injury that McGahee suffered in his last college game) taking over the starting running back role from the injured [[Travis Henry]], and emergence of [[Lee Evans (American football)|Lee Evans]] to give the Bills a second deep threat, sparked the Bills to go 9\u20132 in their next eleven games. This string of victories allowed the Bills to be in the hunt for a final AFC wildcard playoff spot. Though they would lose to the [[2004 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] in the final game of the season, costing them a playoff berth and devastating the fans, the late season surge gave the team a positive direction to approach 2005.\n\nAfter the season, wanting to go in a younger direction and unhappy with [[Drew Bledsoe]]'s overall performance, the Bills decided to hand the starting quarterback reins to [[J. P. Losman]]. This angered Bledsoe, who demanded his release, which the Bills granted. Bledsoe then signed with the [[Dallas Cowboys]], reuniting him with his former [[New England Patriots]] coach [[Bill Parcells]].\n\n===2005\u20132007: Marv Levy returns to the fold===\n\n====2005====\n{{main|2005 Buffalo Bills season}}\n\nLosman's development did not proceed as quickly as the Bills had hoped it would. He began the [[2005 NFL season|2005 season]] 1\u20133 as a starter, prompting [[Kelly Holcomb]] to replace him. Losman would not see action again until Holcomb was injured in Week 10 against the [[2005 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]]. He led the [[2005 Buffalo Bills season|Bills]] to a win in that game, but would again be replaced by Holcomb after losing the next several games. Perhaps the low point of Losman's season was a 24\u201323 loss to the [[2005 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]], a game in which Buffalo led 21\u20130 and 23\u20133, but gave up 21 unanswered points in the 4th quarter. Buffalo's 2005 campaign resulted in a 5\u201311 record and the firing of General Manager [[Tom Donahoe]] in January 2006. Marv Levy was named as his replacement, with hopes that he would improve a franchise that failed to make the playoffs during Donahoe's tenure. That same month, Mike Mularkey resigned as head coach, citing family reasons along with disagreement over the direction of the organization. [[Dick Jauron]] was hired as his replacement.\n\n====2006\u201307: Dick Jauron becomes coach====\n{{main|2006 Buffalo Bills season|2007 Buffalo Bills season}}\n[[File:Anthony Thomas and Shaud Williams.jpg|thumb|right|The Buffalo Bills' uniforms from 2001 to 2010.]] The [[2006 NFL season|2006]] and [[2007 NFL season|2007 seasons]] both brought 7\u20139 records under Jauron's coaching, having been eliminated from playoff contention in December in both years. 2006 saw the additions of [[Donte Whitner]], [[Ko Simpson]], [[Ashton Youboty]], [[Anthony Hargrove]] and [[Kyle Williams (defensive tackle)|Kyle Williams]] to the defensive corps while 2007 brought in [[Trent Edwards]] to quarterback the offense, rookie first-round draft pick [[Marshawn Lynch]], second-round pick [[Paul Posluszny]], offensive linemen [[Derrick Dockery]] and [[Langston Walker]], and backup running back [[Fred Jackson (American football)|Fred Jackson]]. [[J. P. Losman]] played all 16 games in 2006 but was benched in early 2007 in favor of Edwards.\n\nAt the end of the 2007 season, Levy retired once again, citing the fact that he had reached the end of his two-year contract. Meanwhile, offensive coordinator [[Steve Fairchild]], a frequent fan target for the Bills' offensive woes, was hired as head coach of [[Colorado State University]]'s [[Colorado State Rams football|football program]]. Offensive line coach [[Jim McNally]] retired shortly after the end of the season. All of those positions were filled from within, with [[Turk Schonert]] promoted to offensive coordinator.\n\n===2008\u201309: Toronto and Terrell Owens===\n\n====2008====\n{{main|2008 Buffalo Bills season}}\n\nOne of the most notable moves in the league occurred during the 2008 offseason, when league officials approved an [[Bills Toronto Series|October 2007 proposal]] by Bills owner Ralph Wilson to lease his team to Canadian media mogul [[Edward Samuel Rogers|Edward S. \"Ted\" Rogers, Jr.]] to play an annual [[National Football League in Toronto|regular season game and a biennial preseason game]] in Toronto, Ontario, Canada's [[Rogers Centre]] over the next five years, in exchange for a sum of C$78,000,000 cash. The games began during the [[2008 NFL season|2008 season]]. Notable additions to the roster for 2008 include linebacker [[Kawika Mitchell]], acquired as a free agent from the defending Super Bowl champion [[New York Giants]], and defensive tackle [[Marcus Stroud]], in addition to draft picks, cornerback [[Leodis McKelvin]] and wide receiver [[James Hardy (American football)|James Hardy]]. The Bills started extremely well that season, starting out with a 5\u20131 record before their bye week and showing promise in Trent Edwards as finally being a capable quarterback for the Bills. However, Edwards suffered a concussion from a brutal hit in a game against the [[Arizona Cardinals]]. The team then went 2\u20138 in their last games, earning them another 7\u20139 record, which then resulted in the longest active streak of missed playoffs at the time.\n\n====2009====\n[[File:Brian Moorman, October 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Punter [[Brian Moorman]], who was named to the [[National_Football_League_2000s_All-Decade_Team|NFL's 2000s All-Decade team]], was one of the team's few bright spots during this decade]]\n{{main|2009 Buffalo Bills season}}\n\nOn March 7, [[2009 NFL season|2009]] the Buffalo Bills made a major splash in the free agency market when it acquired veteran wide receiver [[Terrell Owens]], who had recently been released by the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. Owens, who was signed to a one-year deal, was infamous for his elaborate touchdown celebrations and controversies with past teammates despite being a superstar player. In addition, former starting quarterback J. P. Losman, by this point relegated to third string behind Trent Edwards and [[Gibran Hamdan]], was allowed to become a free agent. In the first round of the [[2009 NFL Draft]], the Bills selected defensive end/linebacker [[Aaron Maybin]] from [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]] with the 11th overall pick and center [[Eric Wood]] of [[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville]] with the 28th overall pick. Buffalo also selected free safety [[Jarius Byrd]] of Oregon, guard [[Andy Levitre]] of Oregon State, tight end [[Shawn Nelson (American football)|Shawn Nelson]] of Southern Mississippi, and cornerbacks [[Cary Harris]] of USC and [[Ellis Lankster]] of West Virginia.  \n\nAs the season began, Terrell Owens proved to disappoint for most of the season, and the offensive line suffered from severe turnover, leading the team to stumble to a 3\u20136 start, after which the Bills fired head coach [[Dick Jauron]] midseason. Overall, Owens' stats for 2009 were modest: 829 yards and five TDs. The season opener against [[2009 New England Patriots season|New England]] was a loss, although Buffalo's morale was raised by the fact that it was only by a single point. Other notable games included a 16\u201313 OT victory over the [[2009 New York Jets season|Jets]] in Week 6, and the Week 10 game against [[2009 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee]], where Titans owner Bud Adams made an [[the finger|obscene gesture]] at Bills fans and was fined $250,000. The Week 13 game against the Jets was an international series match held across the border in Toronto. In Week 15, the Bills hosted New England, but despite optimistic predictions, fell 17\u201310, marking the fifth season in a row where they lost both matches against the Patriots. This completely eliminated Buffalo from playoff contention and marked their tenth consecutive season without a playoff appearance. On the season ender, they \"routed\" the 14\u20131 [[2009 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] 30\u20137 to end the year at 6\u201310; however, Colts quarterback [[Peyton Manning]] was benched early due to this being a meaningless game for the playoff-bound Colts. \n\nQuarterback Trent Edwards battled injury throughout the whole season with his play regressing throughout the weeks, splitting games with back-up [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]], formerly of the Cincinnati Bengals. The Bills were hit with another hard blow when star running back Marshawn Lynch was given a three-game suspension by NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] for pleading guilty to misdemeanor weapons charges. Though back-up running back Fred Jackson did quite well in Lynch's absence, his performance then hindered on Lynch's return but he still had a 1,000-yard rushing season. However, the performance of free safety Jarius Byrd showed extreme promise as Byrd led the NFL with 9 interceptions and was selected to the [[2010 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]].\n\n===2010\u20132012: The Buddy Nix/Chan Gailey Era===\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 200\n   | footer    = The \"big three\" of Chan Gailey's surprisingly efficient offense consisted of former late-round draft picks or undrafted players.

One of his first personnel moves was to cut ties with Owens (ironically, a man he had recruited during his time in college football).\n\nOn January 20, the team named [[Chan Gailey]] as head coach.  Gailey was previously the offensive coordinator of Kansas City and head coach of Georgia Tech and the Dallas Cowboys, going 8\u20130 in the division in 1998, and leading the team to the postseason in both 1998 and 1999.\n\nWith the expiration of Terrell Owens' contract in March 2010, the Bills chose not to re-sign him.\n\nAs 2010 began, the Bills lost to Miami at home. After going 0\u20134, the Bills released [[Trent Edwards]] and named Ryan Fitzpatrick starting quarterback.  Despite some close games, they ended up at an 0\u20138 record before beating Detroit at home in Week 10. Then came a 49\u201331 win in Cincinnati and an OT loss to Pittsburgh. The team finished 2010 with a 4\u201312 record.\n\n====2011====\n{{main|2011 Buffalo Bills season}}\nThe Bills fired [[Tom Modrak]], one of the last connections to the Donahoe era, shortly after the [[2011 NFL Draft]]. As a result of the Bills' poor play in 2010, the team earned the third overall selection in said draft, using it to select defensive tackle [[Marcell Dareus]] in an effort to improve the team's long-struggling run defense.\n\nBuffalo had an excellent start to 2011, routing [[2011 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City]] 41\u20137. The following week, they hosted Oakland and erased a 21\u20133 deficit, winning 38\u201335. In week 3, the Bills hosted the Patriots; they erased a 21-0 Patriots lead and led 31\u201324 in the fourth; a late [[Tom Brady]] touchdown tied the game, but the Bills whipped into range of a last second field goal.  The 34\u201331 win ended a 15-game franchise losing streak spanning 8 years to the Patriots. Despite starting the 2011 season with a 5\u20132 record, leading the AFC East for several weeks, a wave of injuries to several key starters led to the Bills compiling a 7-game losing streak, pushing the team out of playoff contention for the twelfth straight year. The losing streak was finally broken with a defeat of the [[Tim Tebow]]-led Denver Broncos on Christmas Eve, in a game that had unusually poor attendance.\n\n====2012====\n{{main|2012 Buffalo Bills season}}\nOn March 15, 2012, defensive end and former first-overall pick [[Mario Williams]], formerly of the [[Houston Texans]], signed a six-year contract with the Bills worth up to $100 million ($49.5 million guaranteed), which made it the most lucrative contract for a defensive player in NFL history at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7690355/buffalo-bills-agree-deal-mario-williams |title=Bills, Mario Williams agree to deal |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=March 15, 2012 |accessdate=November 15, 2013}}</ref> Unfortunately, it was not enough to prevent another disappointing season in 2012 in which the Bills finished 6\u201310 again.

After the draft, Nix announced his resignation; [[Doug Whaley]] moved into the general manager position. A knee injury to Manuel and a season-ending concussion to Kolb almost forced the team to start undrafted rookie [[Jeff Tuel]] as their opening day starting quarterback; Manuel nonetheless recovered in time to start week 1 only to injure his other knee a few weeks later, which resulted in the signing of [[Thad Lewis]] (who himself had started a game as an undrafted rookie the previous year with the Cleveland Browns).
