In combination, these two products made it possible to create roaming cordless mesh networks with a robust handoff.\n\n== Technology ==\n=== Protocol ===\n{{Main|Skype protocol}}\n\nSkype uses a [[proprietary protocol|proprietary]] Internet telephony ([[VoIP]]) network called the [[Skype protocol]]. The protocol has not been made publicly available by Skype, and official applications using the protocol are [[Proprietary software|closed-source]]. Part of the Skype technology relies on the Global Index P2P protocol belonging to the Joltid Ltd. corporation. The main difference between Skype and standard VoIP clients is that Skype operates on a [[peer-to-peer]] model (originally based on the [[Kazaa]] software<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/ip-telephony/?p=988 |title=StreamCast sues Kazaa, Skype: here's my take |publisher=Blogs.zdnet.com |date=27 March 2006 |accessdate=31 March 2009}}</ref>), rather than the more usual [[client\u2013server model]] (note that the very popular [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) model of VoIP is also peer-to-peer, but implementation generally requires registration with a server, as does Skype).\n\nOn 20 June 2014, Microsoft announced the deprecation of the old Skype protocol. Within several months from this date, in order to continue using Skype services, Skype users will have to update to Skype applications released in 2014. The new Skype protocol\u2014[[Microsoft Notification Protocol#MSNP24|Microsoft Notification Protocol 24]] was released. The deprecation became effective in the second week of August 2014. Transferred files are now saved on central servers.\n\nAs far as networking stack support is concerned, Skype only supports the [[IPv4]] protocol. It lacks support for the next-generation Internet protocol, [[IPv6]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SkypeTalks/status/264057558262747136|title=Skype does not support IPv6.|publisher=Skype official Twitter account|date=1 November 2012|accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref> [[Skype for Business]], however, includes support for IPv6 addresses, along with continued support of IPv4.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/plan-your-deployment/network-requirements/ipv6 |title=Plan for IPv6 in Skype for Business |date=February 21, 2018 |accessdate=2018-06-13 |work=[[Microsoft]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Protocol detection and control ===\nMany networking and security companies have claimed to detect and control Skype's protocol for enterprise and carrier applications.

In combination, these two products made it possible to create roaming cordless mesh networks with a robust handoff.\n\n== Technology ==\n=== Protocol ===\n{{Main|Skype protocol}}\n\nSkype uses a [[proprietary protocol|proprietary]] Internet telephony ([[VoIP]]) network called the [[Skype protocol]]. The protocol has not been made publicly available by Skype, and official applications using the protocol are [[Proprietary software|closed-source]]. Part of the Skype technology relies on the Global Index P2P protocol belonging to the Joltid Ltd. corporation. The main difference between Skype and standard VoIP clients is that Skype operates on a [[peer-to-peer]] model (originally based on the [[Kazaa]] software<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/ip-telephony/?p=988 |title=StreamCast sues Kazaa, Skype: here's my take |publisher=Blogs.zdnet.com |date=27 March 2006 |accessdate=31 March 2009}}</ref>), rather than the more usual [[client\u2013server model]] (note that the very popular [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) model of VoIP is also peer-to-peer, but implementation generally requires registration with a server, as does Skype).\n\nOn 20 June 2014, Microsoft announced the deprecation of the old Skype protocol. Within several months from this date, in order to continue using Skype services, Skype users will have to update to Skype applications released in 2014. The new Skype protocol\u2014[[Microsoft Notification Protocol#MSNP24|Microsoft Notification Protocol 24]] was released. The deprecation became effective in the second week of August 2014. Transferred files are now saved on central servers.\n\nAs far as networking stack support is concerned, Skype only supports the [[IPv4]] protocol. It lacks support for the next-generation Internet protocol, [[IPv6]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SkypeTalks/status/264057558262747136|title=Skype does not support IPv6.|publisher=Skype official Twitter account|date=1 November 2012|accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref> [[Skype for Business]], however, includes support for IPv6 addresses, along with continued support of IPv4.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/plan-your-deployment/network-requirements/ipv6 |title=Plan for IPv6 in Skype for Business |date=February 21, 2018 |accessdate=2018-06-13 |work=[[Microsoft]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Protocol detection and control ===\nMany networking and security companies have claimed to detect and control Skype's protocol for enterprise and carrier applications.

The term \"[[coaxial]]\" refers to the inner conductor and the outer shield sharing a geometric axis. \n\nCoaxial cable is a type of [[transmission line]], used to carry high frequency [[electrical signal]]s with low losses.  It is used in such applications as telephone trunklines, broadband internet networking cables, high speed computer [[bus (computer)|data busses]], cable television signals, and connecting radio transmitters and receivers to their antennas. It differs from other [[shielded cable]]s because the dimensions of the cable and connectors are controlled to give a precise, constant conductor spacing, which is needed for it to function efficiently as a transmission line.\n\nCoaxial cable was used in the first (1858) and following transatlantic cable installations, but its theory wasn't described until 1880 by English physicist, engineer, and mathematician [[Oliver Heaviside]], who patented the design in that year (British patent No. 1,407).<ref>{{cite book |last=Nahin |first=Paul J. |title=Oliver Heaviside: The Life, Work, and Times of an Electrical Genius of the Victorian Age |year=2002 |isbn=0-8018-6909-9}}</ref>\n[[Image:Oheaviside.jpg|thumb|270px|In his 1880 British patent, Oliver Heaviside showed how coaxial cable could eliminate signal interference between parallel cables.]]\n\n==Applications==\nCoaxial cable is used as a [[transmission line]] for radio frequency signals. Its applications include [[feedline]]s connecting [[radio transmitter]]s and [[Radio receiver|receivers]] to their antennas, computer network (e.g., [[Ethernet]]) connections, [[digital audio]] ([[S/PDIF]]), and distribution of [[cable television]] signals. One advantage of coaxial over other types of radio [[transmission line]] is that in an ideal coaxial cable the [[electromagnetic field]] carrying the signal exists only in the space between the inner and outer [[electrical conductor|conductor]]s. This allows coaxial cable runs to be installed next to metal objects such as gutters without the power losses that occur in other types of transmission lines. Coaxial cable also provides protection of the signal from external [[electromagnetic interference]].\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Coaxial cable cutaway.svg|thumb|right|300px|Coaxial cable cutaway (not to scale)]]\nCoaxial cable conducts electrical signal using an inner conductor (usually a solid copper, stranded copper or copper plated steel wire) surrounded by an insulating layer and all enclosed by a shield, typically one to four layers of woven metallic braid and metallic tape. The cable is protected by an outer insulating jacket. Normally, the outside of the shield is kept at ground potential and a signal carrying voltage is applied to the center conductor. The advantage of coaxial design is that with differential mode, equal push-pull currents on the inner and outer conductors, the signal's electric and magnetic fields are restricted to the [[dielectric]], with little [[Crosstalk (electronics)|leakage]] outside the shield. Further, electric and magnetic fields outside the cable are largely kept from interfering with signals inside the cable, if unequal currents are filtered out at the receiving end of the line. This property makes coaxial cable a good choice both for carrying weak signals, that cannot tolerate interference from the environment, and for stronger electrical signals, that must not be allowed to radiate or couple into adjacent structures or circuits.<ref name=\"Hdbk87_20\">{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 20: Transmission Lines |title=The ARRL Handbook for Radio Communications |edition=87th |publisher=[[ARRL|The American Radio Relay League]] |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-87259-144-8 |editor1=Silver, H.

In radio frequency systems, where the cable length is comparable to the wavelength of the signals transmitted, a uniform cable characteristic impedance is important  to minimize loss. The [[Impedance matching|source and load impedances]] are chosen to match  the impedance of the cable to ensure [[Maximum power transfer theorem|maximum power transfer]] and minimum [[standing wave ratio]]. Other important properties of coaxial cable include attenuation as a function of frequency, voltage handling capability, and shield quality.<ref name=\"Hdbk87_20\"/>\n\n==Construction==\nCoaxial cable design choices affect physical size, frequency performance, attenuation, power handling capabilities, flexibility, strength, and cost. The inner conductor might be solid or stranded; stranded is more flexible. To get better high-frequency performance, the inner conductor may be silver-plated. Copper-plated steel wire is often used as an inner conductor for cable used in the cable TV industry.<ref name=UHFMAN90>''The ARRL UHF/Microwave Experimenter's Manual'', American Radio Relay League, Newington CT USA,1990 {{ISBN|0-87259-312-6}}, Chapter 5 ''Transmission Media'' pages 5.19 through 5.21</ref>\n\nThe insulator surrounding the inner conductor may be solid plastic, a foam plastic, or air with spacers supporting the inner wire. The properties of the dielectric insulator determine some of the electrical properties of the cable. A common choice is a solid [[polyethylene]] (PE) insulator, used in lower-loss cables. Solid [[Teflon]] (PTFE) is also used as an insulator, and exclusively in [[Plenum_cable|plenum-rated]] cables.{{Citation needed|reason=What other types of insulators are used in plenum cable?|date=April 2019}} Some coaxial lines use air (or some other gas) and have spacers to keep the inner conductor from touching the shield.\n\nMany conventional coaxial cables use braided copper wire forming the shield. This allows the cable to be flexible, but it also means there are gaps in the shield layer, and the inner dimension of the shield varies slightly because the braid cannot be flat. Sometimes the braid is silver-plated. For better shield performance, some cables have a double-layer shield.<ref name=UHFMAN90/> The shield might be just two braids, but it is more common now to have a thin foil shield covered by a wire braid. Some cables may invest in more than two shield layers, such as \"quad-shield\", which uses four alternating layers of foil and braid. Other shield designs sacrifice flexibility for better performance; some shields are a solid metal tube. Those cables cannot be bent sharply, as the shield will kink, causing losses in the cable. When a foil shield is used a small wire conductor incorporated into the foil makes soldering the shield termination easier.\n\nFor high-power radio-frequency transmission up to about 1&nbsp;GHz, coaxial cable with a solid copper outer conductor is available in sizes of 0.25&nbsp;inch upward. The outer conductor is corrugated like a [[bellows]] to permit flexibility and the inner conductor is held in position by a plastic spiral to approximate an air dielectric.<ref name=UHFMAN90/> One brand name for such cable is ''Heliax''.<ref>http://www.commscope.com/catalog/wireless/pdf/part/1329/LDF4-50A.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713073522/http://www.commscope.com/catalog/wireless/pdf/part/1329/LDF4-50A.pdf |date=2017-07-13 }} CommScope product specifications, retrieved May 25, 2017</ref>\n\nCoaxial cables require an internal structure of an insulating (dielectric) material to maintain the spacing between the center conductor and shield. The [[dielectric]] losses increase in this order: Ideal dielectric (no loss), vacuum, air, [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (PTFE), polyethylene foam, and solid polyethylene. A low relative permittivity allows for higher-frequency usage. An inhomogeneous dielectric needs to be compensated by a non-circular conductor to avoid current hot-spots.\n\nWhile many cables have a solid dielectric, many others have a foam dielectric that contains as much air or other gas as possible to reduce the losses by allowing the use of a larger diameter center conductor. Foam coax will have about 15% less attenuation but some types of foam dielectric can absorb moisture&mdash;especially at its many surfaces \u2014 in humid environments, significantly increasing the loss. Supports shaped like stars or spokes are even better but more expensive and very susceptible to moisture infiltration. Still more expensive were the air-spaced coaxials used for some inter-city communications in the mid-20th century. The center conductor was suspended by polyethylene discs every few centimeters. In some low-loss coaxial cables such as the RG-62 type, the inner conductor is supported by a spiral strand of polyethylene, so that an air space exists between most of the conductor and the inside of the jacket. The lower [[Permittivity|dielectric constant]] of air allows for a greater inner diameter at the same impedance and a greater outer diameter at the same cutoff frequency, lowering [[ohms law|ohmic losses]]. Inner conductors are sometimes silver-plated to smooth the surface and reduce losses due to [[skin effect]].<ref name=UHFMAN90/> A rough surface extends the current path and concentrates the current at peaks, thus increasing ohmic loss.\n\nThe insulating jacket can be made from many materials. A common choice is [[PVC]], but some applications may require fire-resistant materials. Outdoor applications may require the jacket to resist [[ultraviolet light]], [[oxidation]], rodent damage, or [[Direct-buried cable|direct burial]].  Flooded coaxial cables use a water blocking gel to protect the cable from water infiltration through minor cuts in the jacket.  For internal chassis connections the insulating jacket may be omitted.\n\n==Signal propagation==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}\n[[Twin-lead]] transmission lines have the property that the [[electromagnetic wave]] propagating down the line extends into the space surrounding the parallel wires. These lines have low loss, but also have undesirable characteristics. They cannot be bent, tightly twisted, or otherwise shaped without changing their [[characteristic impedance]], causing reflection of the signal back toward the source. They also cannot be buried or run along or attached to anything [[conductive]], as the extended fields will induce currents in the nearby conductors causing unwanted [[radiation]] and detuning of the line. Coaxial lines largely solve this problem by confining virtually all of the electromagnetic wave to the area inside the cable. Coaxial lines can therefore be bent and moderately twisted without negative effects, and they can be strapped to conductive supports without inducing unwanted currents in them, so long as provisions are made to ensure differential mode signal push-pull currents in the cable.\n\nIn radio-frequency applications up to a few [[gigahertz]], the wave propagates primarily in the [[Transverse electric and magnetic mode|transverse electric magnetic (TEM) mode]], which means that the electric and magnetic fields are both perpendicular to the direction of propagation. However, above a certain [[cutoff frequency]], transverse electric (TE) or transverse magnetic (TM) modes can also propagate, as they do in a [[waveguide]]. It is usually undesirable to transmit signals above the cutoff frequency, since it may cause multiple modes with different [[phase velocity|phase velocities]] to propagate, [[wave interference|interfering]] with each other. The outer diameter is roughly inversely proportional to the [[cutoff frequency]]. A propagating surface-wave mode that does not involve or require the outer shield but only a [[Single-wire transmission line|single central conductor]] also exists in coax but this mode is effectively suppressed in coax of conventional geometry and common impedance. Electric field lines for this [TM] mode have a longitudinal component and require line lengths of a half-wavelength or longer.\n\nCoaxial cable may be viewed as a type of [[Waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]]. Power is transmitted through the radial electric field and the circumferential magnetic field in the TEM00 [[transverse mode]]. This is the dominant mode from zero frequency (DC) to an upper limit determined by the electrical dimensions of the cable.<ref name=jackson>{{cite book|last= Jackson|first=John David|year=1962|title=Classical Electrodynamics|url= https://archive.org/details/ClassicalElectrodynamics|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/ClassicalElectrodynamics/page/n262 244]}}</ref>\n\n==Connectors==\n{{main article|RF connector}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header   =\n| image1   = F-Stecker und Kabel.jpg\n| caption1 = A male [[F connector|F-type]] connector used with common RG-6 cable\n| width1   = 170\n| image2   = N Connector.jpg\n| caption2 = A male [[N connector|N-type]] connector\n| width2   = 180\n| footer   =\n}}\nThe ends of coaxial cables usually terminate with connectors. Coaxial connectors are designed to maintain a coaxial form across the connection and have the same impedance as the attached cable.<ref name=UHFMAN90/> Connectors are usually plated with high-conductivity metals such as silver or tarnish-resistant gold. Due to the [[skin effect]], the RF signal is only carried by the plating at higher frequencies and does not penetrate to the connector body. Silver however tarnishes quickly and the [[silver sulfide]] that is produced is poorly conductive, degrading connector performance, making silver a poor choice for this application.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n==Important parameters==\nCoaxial cable is a particular kind of [[transmission line]], so the circuit models developed for general transmission lines are appropriate.

The \"per unit length\" dimensions cancel out in the impedance formula.\n: At DC the two reactive terms are zero, so the impedance is real-valued, and is extremely high. It looks like\n::<math>Z_\\mathrm{DC} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R}{G}}</math>.\n: With increasing frequency, the reactive components take effect and the impedance of the line is complex-valued. At very low frequencies (audio range, of interest to telephone systems) {{mvar|G}} is typically much smaller than {{mvar|sC}}, so the impedance at low frequencies is\n::<math>Z_\\mathrm{Low Freq} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R}{sC}}</math>,\n:which has a phase value of -45 degrees.\n: At higher frequencies, the reactive terms usually dominate {{mvar|R}} and {{mvar|G}}, and the cable impedance again becomes real-valued.

This is dependent on the loss in the dielectric material filling the cable, and resistive losses in the center conductor and outer shield. These losses are frequency dependent, the losses becoming higher as the frequency increases. Skin effect losses in the conductors can be reduced by increasing the diameter of the cable. A cable with twice the diameter will have half the skin effect resistance.  Ignoring dielectric and other losses, the larger cable would halve the dB/meter loss. In designing a system, engineers consider not only the loss in the cable but also the loss in the connectors.\n*[[Velocity of propagation]], in meters per second.

In coaxial cable, the dominant mode (the mode with the lowest [[cutoff frequency]]) is the TEM mode, which has a cutoff frequency of zero; it propagates all the way down to d.c. The mode with the next lowest cutoff is the TE<sub>11</sub> mode. This mode has one 'wave' (two reversals of polarity) in going around the circumference of the cable. To a good approximation, the condition for the TE<sub>11</sub> mode to propagate is that the wavelength in the dielectric is no longer than the average circumference of the insulator; that is that the frequency is at least\n::<math>f_c \\approx {1 \\over \\pi ({D + d \\over 2}) \\sqrt{\\mu \\epsilon} }= {c \\over \\pi ({D + d \\over 2}) \\sqrt{\\mu_r \\epsilon_r} }</math>.\n:Hence, the cable is single-mode from to d.c. up to this frequency, and might in practice be used up to 90%<ref>{{cite book|last=Kizer|first=George Maurice|title=Microwave communication|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T2fI766k2R0C&pg=PA312|year=1990|publisher=Iowa State University Press|isbn=978-0-8138-0026-4|page=312}}</ref> of this frequency.\n*Peak Voltage.

The cable has the lowest capacitance per unit-length when compared to other coaxial cables of similar size. \n\nAll of the components of a coaxial system should have the same impedance to avoid internal reflections at connections between components. Such reflections may cause signal attenuation and ghosting TV picture display; multiple reflections may cause the original signal to be followed by more than one echo. In analog video or TV systems, this causes [[Ghosting (television)|ghosting]] in the image. Reflections also introduce standing waves, which cause increased losses and can even result in cable dielectric breakdown with high-power transmission (see [[Impedance matching]]). Briefly, if a coaxial cable is open, the termination has nearly infinite resistance, this causes reflections; if the coaxial cable is short-circuited, the termination resistance is nearly zero, there will be reflections with the opposite polarity. Reflection will be nearly eliminated if the coaxial cable is terminated in a pure resistance equal to its impedance.\n\n== Coaxial Characteristic Impedance Derivation ==\n[[File:Coax dimentions.jpg|thumb|Coaxial Cable Dimensions.

Ingress is the passage of an outside signal into the cable and can result in noise and disruption of the desired signal. Egress is the passage of signal intended to remain within the cable into the outside world and can result in a weaker signal at the end of the cable and [[electromagnetic interference|radio frequency interference]] to nearby devices.  Severe leakage usually results from improperly installed connectors or faults in the cable shield.\n\nFor example, in the United States, signal leakage from [[cable television]] systems is regulated by the FCC, since cable signals use the same frequencies as aeronautical and radionavigation bands. CATV operators may also choose to monitor their networks for leakage to prevent ingress. Outside signals entering the cable can cause unwanted noise and picture ghosting. Excessive [[electronic noise|noise]] can overwhelm the signal, making it useless.\n\nAn ideal shield would be a perfect conductor with no holes, gaps, or bumps connected to a perfect ground. However, a smooth solid highly conductive shield would be heavy, inflexible, and expensive.  Such coax is used for straight line feeds to commercial radio broadcast towers.  More economical cables must make compromises between shield efficacy, flexibility, and cost, such as the corrugated surface of flexible hardline, flexible braid, or foil shields. Since shields cannot be perfect conductors, current flowing on the inside of the shield produces an electromagnetic field on the outer surface of the shield.\n\nConsider the [[skin effect]]. The magnitude of an alternating current in a conductor decays exponentially with distance beneath the surface, with the depth of penetration being proportional to the square root of the resistivity. This means that, in a shield of finite thickness, some small amount of current will still be flowing on the opposite surface of the conductor. With a perfect conductor (i.e., zero resistivity), all of the current would flow at the surface, with no penetration into and through the conductor. Real cables have a shield made of an imperfect, although usually very good, conductor, so there must always be some leakage.\n\nThe gaps or holes, allow some of the electromagnetic field to penetrate to the other side. For example, braided shields have many small gaps. The gaps are smaller when using a foil (solid metal) shield, but there is still a seam running the length of the cable. Foil becomes increasingly rigid with increasing thickness, so a thin foil layer is often surrounded by a layer of braided metal, which offers greater flexibility for a given cross-section.\n\nSignal leakage can be severe if there is poor contact at the interface to connectors at either end of the cable or if there is a break in the shield.\n\nTo greatly reduce signal leakage into or out of the cable, by a factor of 1000, or even 10,000, superscreened cables are often used in critical applications, such as for [[neutron]] flux counters in [[nuclear reactors]].\n\nSuperscreened cables for nuclear use are defined in IEC 96-4-1, 1990, however as there have been long gaps in the construction of nuclear power stations in Europe, many existing installations are using superscreened cables to the UK standard AESS(TRG) 71181<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:16035253|title= AESS(TRG) 71181 Part 2, May 1977 Superscreened co-axial cables for the nuclear power industry |date= May 1977 }}</ref> which is referenced in IEC 61917.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meconinfo.co.in/IECPDF/pdf/iec61917%7Bed1.0%7Den.pdf|title=IEC 61917 Cables, cable assemblies and connectors \u2013 Introduction to electromagnetic (EMC) screening measurements First edition 1998-06}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Ground loops===\nA continuous current, even if small, along the imperfect shield of a coaxial cable can cause visible or audible interference. In CATV systems distributing analog signals the potential difference between the coaxial network and the electrical grounding system of a house can cause a visible \"hum bar\" in the picture. This appears as a wide horizontal distortion bar in the picture that scrolls slowly upward. Such differences in potential can be reduced by proper bonding to a common ground at the house. See [[Ground loop (electricity)|ground loop]].\n\n===Noise===\nExternal fields create a voltage across the [[inductance]] of the outside of the outer conductor between sender and receiver. The effect is less when there are several parallel cables, as this reduces the inductance and, therefore, the voltage. Because the outer conductor carries the reference potential for the signal on the inner conductor, the receiving circuit measures the wrong voltage.\n\n====Transformer effect====\nThe [[transformer]] effect is sometimes used to mitigate the effect of currents induced in the shield. The inner and outer conductors form the primary and secondary winding of the transformer, and the effect is enhanced in some high-quality cables that have an outer layer of [[mu-metal]]. Because of this 1:1 transformer, the aforementioned voltage across the outer conductor is transformed onto the inner conductor so that the two voltages can be cancelled by the receiver. Many sender and receivers have means to reduce the leakage even further. They increase the transformer effect by passing the whole cable through a ferrite core one or more times.\n\n===Common mode current and radiation===\nCommon mode current occurs when stray currents in the shield flow in the same direction as the current in the center conductor, causing the coax to radiate. They are the opposite of the desired \"push-pull\" differential mode currents, where the signal currents on the inner and outer conductor are equal and opposite.\n\nMost of the shield effect in coax results from opposing currents in the center conductor and shield creating opposite magnetic fields that cancel, and thus do not radiate. The same effect helps [[ladder line]]. However, ladder line is extremely sensitive to surrounding metal objects, which can enter the fields before they completely cancel. Coax does not have this problem, since the field is enclosed in the shield. However, it is still possible for a field to form between the shield and other connected objects, such as the antenna the coax feeds. The current formed by the field between the antenna and the coax shield would flow in the same direction as the current in the center conductor, and thus not be canceled. Energy would radiate from the coax itself, affecting the [[radiation pattern]] of the antenna. With sufficient power this could be a hazard to people near the cable. A properly placed and properly sized [[balun]] can prevent common mode radiation in coax. An isolating transformer or blocking [[capacitor]] can be used to couple a coaxial cable to equipment, where it is desirable to pass radio-frequency signals but to block direct current or low-frequency power.\n\n==Standards==\n{{More footnotes|section|date=June 2009}}\nMost coaxial cables have a characteristic impedance of either 50, 52, 75, or 93 \u03a9. The RF industry uses standard type-names for coaxial cables.  Thanks to television, [[RG-6]] is the most commonly used coaxial cable for home use, and the majority of connections outside Europe are by [[F connector]]s.\n\nA series of standard types of coaxial cable were specified for [[Army-Navy Equipment Code Designators|military]] uses, in the form \"RG-#\" or \"RG-#/U\". They date from [[World War II]] and were listed in ''MIL-HDBK-216'' published in 1962. These designations are now obsolete. The RG designation stands for Radio Guide; the U designation stands for Universal. The current military standard is [[Defense Standard|MIL-SPEC]] MIL-C-17. MIL-C-17 numbers, such as \"M17/75-RG214\", are given for military cables and manufacturer's catalog numbers for civilian applications. However, the RG-series designations were so common for generations that they are still used, although critical users should be aware that since the handbook is withdrawn there is no standard to guarantee the electrical and physical characteristics of a cable described as \"RG-# type\". The RG designators are mostly used to identify compatible [[electrical connector|connector]]s that fit the inner conductor, dielectric, and jacket dimensions of the old RG-series cables.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:97%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Type\n! rowspan=2 data-sort-type=\"number\" | [[Characteristic impedance|Impedance]]<br />(ohms)\n! rowspan=2 | Core (mm)\n! colspan=4 data-sort-type=\"number\" | Dielectric\n! colspan=2 data-sort-type=\"number\" | Outside diameter\n! rowspan=2 | Shields\n! rowspan=2 style=\"width:250px;\" | Remarks\n! rowspan=2 data-sort-type=\"number\" | Max. attenuation, 750&nbsp;MHz <br/>(dB/100&nbsp;ft)\n|-\n!

While formerly common for implementing [[computer network]]s, in particular [[Ethernet]] (\"thick\" [[10BASE5]] and \"thin\" [[10BASE2]]), [[twisted pair]] cables have replaced them in most applications except in the growing consumer [[cable modem]] market for [[broadband Internet access]].\n\nLong distance coaxial cable was used in the 20th century to connect [[radio network]]s, [[television network]]s, and [[L-carrier|Long Distance telephone]] networks though this has largely been superseded by later methods ([[fibre optics]], [[T-carrier|T1]]/[[E-carrier|E1]], [[satellite]]).\n\nShorter coaxials still carry [[cable television]] signals to the majority of television receivers, and this purpose consumes the majority of coaxial cable production. In 1980s and early 1990s coaxial cable was also used in [[computer networking]], most prominently in [[Ethernet]] networks, where it was later in late 1990s to early 2000s replaced by [[Unshielded twisted pair|UTP]] cables in North America and [[Shielded twisted pair|STP]] cables in Western Europe, both with 8P8C modular connectors.\n\nMicro coaxial cables are used in a range of consumer devices, military equipment, and also in ultra-sound scanning equipment.\n\nThe most common impedances that are widely used are 50 or 52 ohms, and 75 ohms, although other impedances are available for specific applications. The 50 / 52 ohm cables are widely used for industrial and commercial [[two-way radio]] frequency applications (including radio, and telecommunications), although 75 ohms is commonly used for [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] television and radio.\n\nCoax cable is often used to carry data/signals from an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] to a receiver\u2014from a [[satellite dish]] to a satellite receiver, from a [[television antenna]] to a [[television receiver]], from a [[radio mast]] to a [[radio receiver]], etc.\nIn many cases, the same single coax cable carries power in the opposite direction, to the antenna, to power the [[low-noise amplifier]].\nIn some cases a single coax cable carries (unidirectional) power and bidirectional data/signals, as in [[DiSEqC]].\n\n==Types==\n\n===Hard line===\n[[File:Coaxialcableoneandfifthofan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|{{convert|1+5/8|in|abbr=on}} flexible line]]\n[[File:CDMA_Cell_antenna.jpg|thumb|right|200px|1-5/8\" Heliax coaxial cable]]\nHard line is used in [[broadcasting]] as well as many other forms of [[radio]] [[communication]]. It is a coaxial cable constructed using round copper, silver or gold tubing or a combination of such metals as a shield. Some lower-quality hard line may use aluminum shielding, aluminum however is easily oxidized and unlike silver oxide, aluminum oxide drastically loses effective conductivity. Therefore, all connections must be air and water tight. The center conductor may consist of solid copper, or copper-plated aluminum. Since skin effect is an issue with RF, copper plating provides sufficient surface for an effective conductor.  Most varieties of hardline used for external chassis or when exposed to the elements have a PVC jacket; however, some internal applications may omit the insulation jacket. Hard line can be very thick, typically at least a half inch or 13&nbsp;mm and up to several times that, and has low loss even at high power. These large-scale hard lines are almost always used in the connection between a [[transmitter]] on the ground and the [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] or aerial on a tower. Hard line may also be known by trademarked names such as Heliax ([[CommScope]]),<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.commscope.com/Product-Catalog/Wireless/Brand/Fiber-to-the-Antenna-(FTTA)/HELIAX--FiberFeed-/\n|title=CommScope Heliax\n|access-date=2016-06-28\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160628122045/http://www.commscope.com/Product-Catalog/Wireless/Brand/Fiber-to-the-Antenna-(FTTA)/HELIAX--FiberFeed-/\n|archive-date=2016-06-28\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref> or Cablewave (RFS/Cablewave).<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.rfsworld.com/\n|title=Cablewave Radio Frequency Systems <http://www.rfsworld.com>\n}}</ref> Larger varieties of hardline may have a center conductor that is constructed from either rigid or corrugated copper tubing. The dielectric in hard line may consist of polyethylene foam, air, or a pressurized gas such as [[nitrogen]] or desiccated air (dried air). In gas-charged lines, hard plastics such as nylon are used as spacers to separate the inner and outer conductors. The addition of these gases into the dielectric space reduces moisture contamination, provides a stable dielectric constant, and provides a reduced risk of internal [[Electric arc|arc]]ing. Gas-filled hardlines are usually used on high-power [[Radio frequency|RF]] transmitters such as television or radio broadcasting, military transmitters, and high-power [[amateur radio]] applications but may also be used on some critical lower-power applications such as those in the microwave bands. However, in the microwave region, ''[[waveguide]]'' is more often used than hard line for transmitter-to-antenna, or antenna-to-receiver applications. The various shields used in hardline also differ; some forms use rigid tubing, or pipe, while others may use a corrugated tubing, which makes bending easier, as well as reduces kinking when the cable is bent to conform. Smaller varieties of hard line may be used internally in some high-frequency applications, in particular in equipment within the microwave range, to reduce interference between stages of the device.\n\n===Radiating===\n{{Main article|Leaky feeder}}\n'''Radiating''' or '''leaky cable''' is another form of coaxial cable which is constructed in a similar fashion to hard line, however it is constructed with tuned slots cut into the shield. These slots are tuned to the specific RF wavelength of operation or tuned to a specific radio frequency band. This type of cable is to provide a tuned bi-directional \"desired\" leakage effect between transmitter and receiver. It is often used in elevator shafts, US Navy Ships, underground transportation tunnels and in other areas where an antenna is not feasible.  One example of this type of cable is Radiax ([[CommScope]]).<ref>{{cite web\n|url= http://www.commscope.com/Product-Catalog/Wireless/Brand/RADIAX-/\n|title= CommScope Radiax\n|access-date= 2016-06-28\n|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160530224242/http://www.commscope.com/Product-Catalog/Wireless/Brand/RADIAX-/\n|archive-date= 2016-05-30\n|url-status= dead\n}}</ref>\n\n===RG-6===\n{{Main article|RG-6}}\n'''RG-6''' is available in four different types designed for various applications.  In addition, the core may be copper clad steel (CCS) or bare solid copper (BC).  \"Plain\" or \"house\" RG-6 is designed for indoor or external house wiring. \"Flooded\" cable is infused with waterblocking gel for use in underground conduit or direct burial. \"Messenger\" may contain some waterproofing but is distinguished by the addition of a steel [[messenger wire]] along its length to carry the tension involved in an aerial drop from a utility pole.  \"[[plenum cable|Plenum]]\" cabling is expensive and comes with a special Teflon-based outer jacket designed for use in ventilation ducts to meet fire codes. It was developed since the plastics used as the outer jacket and inner insulation in many \"Plain\" or \"house\" cabling gives off poisonous gas when burned.\n\n===Triaxial cable===\n{{Main article|Triaxial cable}}\n'''Triaxial cable''' or '''triax''' is coaxial cable with a third layer of shielding, insulation and sheathing. The outer shield, which is earthed (grounded), protects the inner shield from electromagnetic interference from outside sources.\n\n===Twin-axial cable===\n{{Main article|Twinaxial cabling}}\n'''Twin-axial cable''' or '''twinax''' is a balanced, twisted pair within a cylindrical shield. It allows a nearly perfect differential mode signal which is ''both'' shielded ''and'' balanced to pass through. Multi-conductor coaxial cable is also sometimes used.\n\n===Semi-rigid===\n[[File:Semi-Rigid Coax.png|thumb|right|Semi-Rigid coax assembly]]\n[[File:Semi-Rigid Coax Installed.jpg|thumb|right|Semi-Rigid coax installed in an Agilent N9344C 20GHz spectrum analyser]]\n'''Semi-rigid''' cable is a coaxial form using a solid copper outer sheath. This type of coax offers superior screening compared to cables with a braided outer conductor, especially at higher frequencies. The major disadvantage is that the cable, as its name implies, is not very flexible, and is not intended to be flexed after initial forming. (See \"hard line\")\n\nConformable cable is a flexible reformable alternative to semi-rigid coaxial cable used where flexibility is required. Conformable cable can be stripped and formed by hand without the need for specialized tools, similar to standard coaxial cable.\n\n===Rigid line===\n'''Rigid line''' is a coaxial line formed by two copper tubes maintained concentric every other meter using PTFE-supports. Rigid lines cannot be bent, so they often need elbows. Interconnection with rigid line is done with an inner bullet/inner support and a flange or connection kit. Typically, rigid lines are connected using standardised [[EIA RF Connectors]] whose bullet and flange sizes match the standard line diameters. For each outer diameter, either 75 or 50&nbsp;ohm inner tubes can be obtained. \nRigid line is commonly used indoors for interconnection between high power transmitters and other RF-components, but more rugged rigid line with weatherproof flanges is used outdoors on antenna masts, etc. In the interests of saving weight and costs, on masts and similar structures the outer line is often aluminium, and special care must be taken to prevent corrosion.\nWith a flange connector, it is also possible to go from rigid line to hard line. Many broadcasting antennas and antenna splitters use the flanged rigid line interface even when connecting to flexible coaxial cables and hard line.\nRigid line is produced in a number of different sizes:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Size\n! colspan=2 | Outer conductor\n! colspan=2 | Inner conductor\n|-\n!

This cable had a 1&nbsp;mm copper core, air-spaced polyethylene dielectric and copper braid on an aluminium foil shield. When installed outdoors without protection, the cable was affected by UV radiation, which cracked the PVC outer sheath and allowed moisture ingress. The combination of copper, aluminium, moisture and air caused rapid corrosion, sometimes resulting in a 'snake swallowed an egg' appearance. Consequently, despite the higher cost, the RG6 cable was dropped in favour of CT100 when BSKYB launched its digital broadcasts.\n\nFrom around 1999 to 2005 (when CT100 manufacturer Raydex went out of business), CT100 remained the 75 ohm cable of choice for satellite TV and especially BskyB. It had an air-spaced polyethylene dielectric, a 1&nbsp;mm solid copper core and copper braid on copper foil shield. CT63 was a thinner cable in 'shotgun' style, meaning that it was two cables moulded together and was used mainly by BskyB for the twin connection required by the ''Sky+'' satellite TV receiver, which incorporated a hard drive recording system and a second, independent tuner.\n\nIn 2005, these cables were replaced by WF100 and WF65, respectively, manufactured by Webro and having a similar construction but a foam dielectric that provided the same electrical performance as air-spaced but was more robust and less likely to be crushed.\n\nAt the same time, with the price of copper steadily rising, the original RG6 was dropped in favour of a construction that used a copper-clad steel core and aluminium braid on aluminium foil. Its lower price made it attractive to aerial installers looking for a replacement for the so-called ''low-loss'' cable traditionally used for UK terrestrial aerial installations. This cable had been manufactured with a decreasing number of strands of braid, as the price of copper increased, such that the shielding performance of cheaper brands had fallen to as low as 40 percent. With the advent of digital terrestrial transmissions in the UK, this low-loss cable was no longer suitable.\n\nThe new RG6 still performed well at high frequencies because of the skin effect in the copper cladding. However, the aluminium shield had a high DC resistance and the steel core an even higher one. The result is that this type of cable could not reliably be used in satellite TV installations, where it was required to carry a significant amount of current, because the voltage drop affected the operation of the low noise block downconverter (LNB) on the dish.\n\nA problem with all the aforementioned cables, when passing current, is that electrolytic corrosion can occur in the connections unless moisture and air are excluded. Consequently, various solutions to exclude moisture have been proposed. The first was to seal the connection by wrapping it with self-amalgamating rubberised tape, which bonds to itself when activated by stretching. The second proposal, by the American Channel Master company (now owned by Andrews corp.) at least as early as 1999, was to apply [[silicone grease]] to the wires making connection. The third proposal was to fit a self-sealing plug to the cable. All of these methods are reasonably successful if implemented correctly.\n\n==Interference and troubleshooting==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}\nCoaxial cable insulation may degrade, requiring replacement of the cable, especially if it has been exposed to the elements on a continuous basis. The shield is normally grounded, and if even a single thread of the braid or filament of foil touches the center conductor, the signal will be shorted causing significant or total signal loss. This most often occurs at improperly installed end connectors and splices. Also, the connector or splice must be properly attached to the shield, as this provides the path to ground for the interfering signal.\n\nDespite being shielded, interference can occur on coaxial cable lines.  Susceptibility to interference has little relationship to broad cable type designations (e.g. RG-59, RG-6) but is strongly related to the composition and configuration of the cable's shielding.  For [[cable television]], with frequencies extending well into the UHF range, a foil shield is normally provided, and will provide total coverage as well as high effectiveness against high-frequency interference.  Foil shielding is ordinarily accompanied by a tinned copper or aluminum braid shield, with anywhere from 60 to 95% coverage.  The braid is important to shield effectiveness because (1) it is more effective than foil at preventing low-frequency interference, (2) it provides higher conductivity to ground than foil, and (3) it makes attaching a connector easier and more reliable.  \"Quad-shield\" cable, using two low-coverage aluminum braid shields and two layers of foil, is often used in situations involving troublesome interference, but is less effective than a single layer of foil and single high-coverage copper braid shield such as is found on broadcast-quality precision video cable.\n\nIn the [[United States]] and some other countries, [[cable television]] distribution systems use extensive networks of outdoor coaxial cable, often with in-line distribution amplifiers.  Leakage of signals into and out of cable TV systems can cause interference to cable subscribers and to over-the-air radio services using the same frequencies as those of the cable system.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:WNBC-AM early coaxial feedline.jpg|thumb|Early coaxial antenna feedline of 50 kW radio station [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]], New York, in 1930s]]\n[[File:AT&T coaxial trunkline 1949.jpg|thumb|upright|AT&T coaxial cable trunkline installed between East Coast and Midwest in 1948.

Many coaxial cables also have an insulating outer sheath or jacket.  The term [[coaxial]] comes from the inner conductor and the outer shield sharing a geometric axis. Coaxial cable was used in the first (1858) and following transatlantic cable installations, but its theory wasn't described until 1880 by English physicist, engineer, and mathematician [[Oliver Heaviside]], who patented the design in that year (British patent No. 1,407).<ref>{{cite book |last=Nahin |first=Paul J. |title=Oliver Heaviside: The Life, Work, and Times of an Electrical Genius of the Victorian Age |year=2002 |isbn=0-8018-6909-9}}</ref>\n\nCoaxial cable is a type of [[transmission line]], used to carry high [[frequency]] [[electrical signal]]s with low losses.  It is used in such applications as telephone trunklines, [[broadband internet]] networking cables,  high speed computer [[bus (computer)|data busses]], carrying [[cable television]] signals, and connecting [[radio transmitter]]s and [[radio receiver|receivers]] to their [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]s. It differs from other [[shielded cable]]s because the dimensions of the cable and connectors are controlled to give a precise, constant conductor spacing, which is needed for it to function efficiently as a transmission line.\n[[Image:Oheaviside.jpg|thumb|270px|In his 1880 British patent, Oliver Heaviside showed how coaxial cable could eliminate signal interference between parallel cables.]]\n\n==Applications==\nCoaxial cable is used as a [[transmission line]] for radio frequency signals. Its applications include [[feedline]]s connecting [[radio transmitter]]s and [[Radio receiver|receivers]] to their antennas, computer network (e.g., [[Ethernet]]) connections, [[digital audio]] ([[S/PDIF]]), and distribution of [[cable television]] signals. One advantage of coaxial over other types of radio [[transmission line]] is that in an ideal coaxial cable the [[electromagnetic field]] carrying the signal exists only in the space between the inner and outer [[electrical conductor|conductor]]s. This allows coaxial cable runs to be installed next to metal objects such as gutters without the power losses that occur in other types of transmission lines. Coaxial cable also provides protection of the signal from external [[electromagnetic interference]].\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Coaxial cable cutaway.svg|thumb|right|300px|Coaxial cable cutaway (not to scale)]]\nCoaxial cable conducts electrical signal using an inner conductor (usually a solid copper, stranded copper or copper plated steel wire) surrounded by an insulating layer and all enclosed by a shield, typically one to four layers of woven metallic braid and metallic tape. The cable is protected by an outer insulating jacket. Normally, the outside of the shield is kept at ground potential and a signal carrying voltage is applied to the center conductor. The advantage of coaxial design is that with differential mode, equal push-pull currents on the inner and outer conductors, the signal's electric and magnetic fields are restricted to the [[dielectric]], with little [[Crosstalk (electronics)|leakage]] outside the shield. Further, electric and magnetic fields outside the cable are largely kept from interfering with signals inside the cable, if unequal currents are filtered out at the receiving end of the line. This property makes coaxial cable a good choice both for carrying weak signals, that cannot tolerate interference from the environment, and for stronger electrical signals, that must not be allowed to radiate or couple into adjacent structures or circuits.<ref name=\"Hdbk87_20\">{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 20: Transmission Lines |title=The ARRL Handbook for Radio Communications |edition=87th |publisher=[[ARRL|The American Radio Relay League]] |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-87259-144-8 |editor1=Silver, H.

In radio frequency systems, where the cable length is comparable to the wavelength of the signals transmitted, a uniform cable characteristic impedance is important  to minimize loss. The [[Impedance matching|source and load impedances]] are chosen to match  the impedance of the cable to ensure [[Maximum power transfer theorem|maximum power transfer]] and minimum [[standing wave ratio]]. Other important properties of coaxial cable include attenuation as a function of frequency, voltage handling capability, and shield quality.<ref name=\"Hdbk87_20\"/>\n\n==Construction==\nCoaxial cable design choices affect physical size, frequency performance, attenuation, power handling capabilities, flexibility, strength, and cost. The inner conductor might be solid or stranded; stranded is more flexible. To get better high-frequency performance, the inner conductor may be silver-plated. Copper-plated steel wire is often used as an inner conductor for cable used in the cable TV industry.<ref name=UHFMAN90>''The ARRL UHF/Microwave Experimenter's Manual'', American Radio Relay League, Newington CT USA,1990 {{ISBN|0-87259-312-6}}, Chapter 5 ''Transmission Media'' pages 5.19 through 5.21</ref>\n\nThe insulator surrounding the inner conductor may be solid plastic, a foam plastic, or air with spacers supporting the inner wire. The properties of the dielectric insulator determine some of the electrical properties of the cable. A common choice is a solid [[polyethylene]] (PE) insulator, used in lower-loss cables. Solid [[Teflon]] (PTFE) is also used as an insulator, and exclusively in [[Plenum_cable|plenum-rated]] cables.{{Citation needed|reason=What other types of insulators are used in plenum cable?|date=April 2019}} Some coaxial lines use air (or some other gas) and have spacers to keep the inner conductor from touching the shield.\n\nMany conventional coaxial cables use braided copper wire forming the shield. This allows the cable to be flexible, but it also means there are gaps in the shield layer, and the inner dimension of the shield varies slightly because the braid cannot be flat. Sometimes the braid is silver-plated. For better shield performance, some cables have a double-layer shield.<ref name=UHFMAN90/> The shield might be just two braids, but it is more common now to have a thin foil shield covered by a wire braid. Some cables may invest in more than two shield layers, such as \"quad-shield\", which uses four alternating layers of foil and braid. Other shield designs sacrifice flexibility for better performance; some shields are a solid metal tube. Those cables cannot be bent sharply, as the shield will kink, causing losses in the cable. When a foil shield is used a small wire conductor incorporated into the foil makes soldering the shield termination easier.\n\nFor high-power radio-frequency transmission up to about 1&nbsp;GHz, coaxial cable with a solid copper outer conductor is available in sizes of 0.25&nbsp;inch upward. The outer conductor is corrugated like a [[bellows]] to permit flexibility and the inner conductor is held in position by a plastic spiral to approximate an air dielectric.<ref name=UHFMAN90/> One brand name for such cable is ''Heliax''.<ref>http://www.commscope.com/catalog/wireless/pdf/part/1329/LDF4-50A.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713073522/http://www.commscope.com/catalog/wireless/pdf/part/1329/LDF4-50A.pdf |date=2017-07-13 }} CommScope product specifications, retrieved May 25, 2017</ref>\n\nCoaxial cables require an internal structure of an insulating (dielectric) material to maintain the spacing between the center conductor and shield. The [[dielectric]] losses increase in this order: Ideal dielectric (no loss), vacuum, air, [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (PTFE), polyethylene foam, and solid polyethylene. A low relative permittivity allows for higher-frequency usage. An inhomogeneous dielectric needs to be compensated by a non-circular conductor to avoid current hot-spots.\n\nWhile many cables have a solid dielectric, many others have a foam dielectric that contains as much air or other gas as possible to reduce the losses by allowing the use of a larger diameter center conductor. Foam coax will have about 15% less attenuation but some types of foam dielectric can absorb moisture&mdash;especially at its many surfaces \u2014 in humid environments, significantly increasing the loss. Supports shaped like stars or spokes are even better but more expensive and very susceptible to moisture infiltration. Still more expensive were the air-spaced coaxials used for some inter-city communications in the mid-20th century. The center conductor was suspended by polyethylene discs every few centimeters. In some low-loss coaxial cables such as the RG-62 type, the inner conductor is supported by a spiral strand of polyethylene, so that an air space exists between most of the conductor and the inside of the jacket. The lower [[Permittivity|dielectric constant]] of air allows for a greater inner diameter at the same impedance and a greater outer diameter at the same cutoff frequency, lowering [[ohms law|ohmic losses]]. Inner conductors are sometimes silver-plated to smooth the surface and reduce losses due to [[skin effect]].<ref name=UHFMAN90/> A rough surface extends the current path and concentrates the current at peaks, thus increasing ohmic loss.\n\nThe insulating jacket can be made from many materials. A common choice is [[PVC]], but some applications may require fire-resistant materials. Outdoor applications may require the jacket to resist [[ultraviolet light]], [[oxidation]], rodent damage, or [[Direct-buried cable|direct burial]].  Flooded coaxial cables use a water blocking gel to protect the cable from water infiltration through minor cuts in the jacket.  For internal chassis connections the insulating jacket may be omitted.\n\n==Signal propagation==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}\n[[Twin-lead]] transmission lines have the property that the [[electromagnetic wave]] propagating down the line extends into the space surrounding the parallel wires. These lines have low loss, but also have undesirable characteristics. They cannot be bent, tightly twisted, or otherwise shaped without changing their [[characteristic impedance]], causing reflection of the signal back toward the source. They also cannot be buried or run along or attached to anything [[conductive]], as the extended fields will induce currents in the nearby conductors causing unwanted [[radiation]] and detuning of the line. Coaxial lines largely solve this problem by confining virtually all of the electromagnetic wave to the area inside the cable. Coaxial lines can therefore be bent and moderately twisted without negative effects, and they can be strapped to conductive supports without inducing unwanted currents in them, so long as provisions are made to ensure differential mode signal push-pull currents in the cable.\n\nIn radio-frequency applications up to a few [[gigahertz]], the wave propagates primarily in the [[Transverse electric and magnetic mode|transverse electric magnetic (TEM) mode]], which means that the electric and magnetic fields are both perpendicular to the direction of propagation. However, above a certain [[cutoff frequency]], transverse electric (TE) or transverse magnetic (TM) modes can also propagate, as they do in a [[waveguide]]. It is usually undesirable to transmit signals above the cutoff frequency, since it may cause multiple modes with different [[phase velocity|phase velocities]] to propagate, [[wave interference|interfering]] with each other. The outer diameter is roughly inversely proportional to the [[cutoff frequency]]. A propagating surface-wave mode that does not involve or require the outer shield but only a [[Single-wire transmission line|single central conductor]] also exists in coax but this mode is effectively suppressed in coax of conventional geometry and common impedance. Electric field lines for this [TM] mode have a longitudinal component and require line lengths of a half-wavelength or longer.\n\nCoaxial cable may be viewed as a type of [[Waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]]. Power is transmitted through the radial electric field and the circumferential magnetic field in the TEM00 [[transverse mode]]. This is the dominant mode from zero frequency (DC) to an upper limit determined by the electrical dimensions of the cable.<ref name=jackson>{{cite book|last= Jackson|first=John David|year=1962|title=Classical Electrodynamics|url= https://archive.org/details/ClassicalElectrodynamics|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/ClassicalElectrodynamics/page/n262 244]}}</ref>\n\n==Connectors==\n{{main article|RF connector}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header   =\n| image1   = F-Stecker und Kabel.jpg\n| caption1 = A male [[F connector|F-type]] connector used with common RG-6 cable\n| width1   = 170\n| image2   = N Connector.jpg\n| caption2 = A male [[N connector|N-type]] connector\n| width2   = 180\n| footer   =\n}}\nThe ends of coaxial cables usually terminate with connectors. Coaxial connectors are designed to maintain a coaxial form across the connection and have the same impedance as the attached cable.<ref name=UHFMAN90/> Connectors are usually plated with high-conductivity metals such as silver or tarnish-resistant gold. Due to the [[skin effect]], the RF signal is only carried by the plating at higher frequencies and does not penetrate to the connector body. Silver however tarnishes quickly and the [[silver sulfide]] that is produced is poorly conductive, degrading connector performance, making silver a poor choice for this application.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n==Important parameters==\nCoaxial cable is a particular kind of [[transmission line]], so the circuit models developed for general transmission lines are appropriate.

In coaxial cable, the dominant mode (the mode with the lowest [[cutoff frequency]]) is the TEM mode, which has a cutoff frequency of zero; it propagates all the way down to d.c. The mode with the next lowest cutoff is the TE<sub>11</sub> mode. This mode has one 'wave' (two reversals of polarity) in going around the circumference of the cable. To a good approximation, the condition for the TE<sub>11</sub> mode to propagate is that the wavelength in the dielectric is no longer than the average circumference of the insulator; that is that the frequency is at least\n::<math>f_c \\approx {1 \\over \\pi ({D + d \\over 2}) \\sqrt{\\mu \\epsilon} }= {c \\over \\pi ({D + d \\over 2}) \\sqrt{\\mu_r \\epsilon_r} }</math>.\n:Hence, the cable is single-mode from to d.c. up to this frequency, and might in practice be used up to 90%<ref>{{cite book|last=Kizer|first=George Maurice|title=Microwave communication|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T2fI766k2R0C&pg=PA312|year=1990|publisher=Iowa State University Press|isbn=978-0-8138-0026-4|page=312}}</ref> of this frequency.\n*Peak Voltage.

These typically involve such low levels of RF power that power-handling and high-voltage breakdown characteristics are unimportant when compared to attenuation.

Later, some manufacturers of LAN equipment, such as Datapoint for [[ARCNET]], adopted RG-62 as their coaxial cable standard. The cable has the lowest capacitance per unit-length when compared to other coaxial cables of similar size. \n\nAll of the components of a coaxial system should have the same impedance to avoid internal reflections at connections between components. Such reflections may cause signal attenuation and ghosting TV picture display; multiple reflections may cause the original signal to be followed by more than one echo. In analog video or TV systems, this causes [[Ghosting (television)|ghosting]] in the image. Reflections also introduce standing waves, which cause increased losses and can even result in cable dielectric breakdown with high-power transmission (see [[Impedance matching]]). Briefly, if a coaxial cable is open, the termination has nearly infinite resistance, this causes reflections; if the coaxial cable is short-circuited, the termination resistance is nearly zero, there will be reflections with the opposite polarity. Reflection will be nearly eliminated if the coaxial cable is terminated in a pure resistance equal to its impedance.\n\n== Coaxial Characteristic Impedance Derivation ==\n[[File:Coax dimentions.jpg|thumb|Coaxial Cable Dimensions.

Ingress is the passage of an outside signal into the cable and can result in noise and disruption of the desired signal. Egress is the passage of signal intended to remain within the cable into the outside world and can result in a weaker signal at the end of the cable and [[electromagnetic interference|radio frequency interference]] to nearby devices.  Severe leakage usually results from improperly installed connectors or faults in the cable shield.\n\nFor example, in the United States, signal leakage from [[cable television]] systems is regulated by the FCC, since cable signals use the same frequencies as aeronautical and radionavigation bands. CATV operators may also choose to monitor their networks for leakage to prevent ingress. Outside signals entering the cable can cause unwanted noise and picture ghosting. Excessive [[electronic noise|noise]] can overwhelm the signal, making it useless.\n\nAn ideal shield would be a perfect conductor with no holes, gaps, or bumps connected to a perfect ground. However, a smooth solid highly conductive shield would be heavy, inflexible, and expensive.  Such coax is used for straight line feeds to commercial radio broadcast towers.  More economical cables must make compromises between shield efficacy, flexibility, and cost, such as the corrugated surface of flexible hardline, flexible braid, or foil shields. Since shields cannot be perfect conductors, current flowing on the inside of the shield produces an electromagnetic field on the outer surface of the shield.\n\nConsider the [[skin effect]]. The magnitude of an alternating current in a conductor decays exponentially with distance beneath the surface, with the depth of penetration being proportional to the square root of the resistivity. This means that, in a shield of finite thickness, some small amount of current will still be flowing on the opposite surface of the conductor. With a perfect conductor (i.e., zero resistivity), all of the current would flow at the surface, with no penetration into and through the conductor. Real cables have a shield made of an imperfect, although usually very good, conductor, so there must always be some leakage.\n\nThe gaps or holes, allow some of the electromagnetic field to penetrate to the other side. For example, braided shields have many small gaps. The gaps are smaller when using a foil (solid metal) shield, but there is still a seam running the length of the cable. Foil becomes increasingly rigid with increasing thickness, so a thin foil layer is often surrounded by a layer of braided metal, which offers greater flexibility for a given cross-section.\n\nSignal leakage can be severe if there is poor contact at the interface to connectors at either end of the cable or if there is a break in the shield.\n\nTo greatly reduce signal leakage into or out of the cable, by a factor of 1000, or even 10,000, superscreened cables are often used in critical applications, such as for [[neutron]] flux counters in [[nuclear reactors]].\n\nSuperscreened cables for nuclear use are defined in IEC 96-4-1, 1990, however as there have been long gaps in the construction of nuclear power stations in Europe, many existing installations are using superscreened cables to the UK standard AESS(TRG) 71181<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:16035253|title= AESS(TRG) 71181 Part 2, May 1977 Superscreened co-axial cables for the nuclear power industry |date= May 1977 }}</ref> which is referenced in IEC 61917.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meconinfo.co.in/IECPDF/pdf/iec61917%7Bed1.0%7Den.pdf|title=IEC 61917 Cables, cable assemblies and connectors \u2013 Introduction to electromagnetic (EMC) screening measurements First edition 1998-06}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Ground loops===\nA continuous current, even if small, along the imperfect shield of a coaxial cable can cause visible or audible interference. In CATV systems distributing analog signals the potential difference between the coaxial network and the electrical grounding system of a house can cause a visible \"hum bar\" in the picture. This appears as a wide horizontal distortion bar in the picture that scrolls slowly upward. Such differences in potential can be reduced by proper bonding to a common ground at the house. See [[Ground loop (electricity)|ground loop]].\n\n===Noise===\nExternal fields create a voltage across the [[inductance]] of the outside of the outer conductor between sender and receiver. The effect is less when there are several parallel cables, as this reduces the inductance and, therefore, the voltage. Because the outer conductor carries the reference potential for the signal on the inner conductor, the receiving circuit measures the wrong voltage.\n\n====Transformer effect====\nThe [[transformer]] effect is sometimes used to mitigate the effect of currents induced in the shield. The inner and outer conductors form the primary and secondary winding of the transformer, and the effect is enhanced in some high-quality cables that have an outer layer of [[mu-metal]]. Because of this 1:1 transformer, the aforementioned voltage across the outer conductor is transformed onto the inner conductor so that the two voltages can be cancelled by the receiver. Many sender and receivers have means to reduce the leakage even further. They increase the transformer effect by passing the whole cable through a ferrite core one or more times.\n\n===Common mode current and radiation===\nCommon mode current occurs when stray currents in the shield flow in the same direction as the current in the center conductor, causing the coax to radiate. They are the opposite of the desired \"push-pull\" differential mode currents, where the signal currents on the inner and outer conductor are equal and opposite.\n\nMost of the shield effect in coax results from opposing currents in the center conductor and shield creating opposite magnetic fields that cancel, and thus do not radiate. The same effect helps [[ladder line]]. However, ladder line is extremely sensitive to surrounding metal objects, which can enter the fields before they completely cancel. Coax does not have this problem, since the field is enclosed in the shield. However, it is still possible for a field to form between the shield and other connected objects, such as the antenna the coax feeds. The current formed by the field between the antenna and the coax shield would flow in the same direction as the current in the center conductor, and thus not be canceled. Energy would radiate from the coax itself, affecting the [[radiation pattern]] of the antenna. With sufficient power this could be a hazard to people near the cable. A properly placed and properly sized [[balun]] can prevent common mode radiation in coax. An isolating transformer or blocking [[capacitor]] can be used to couple a coaxial cable to equipment, where it is desirable to pass radio-frequency signals but to block direct current or low-frequency power.\n\n==Standards==\n{{More footnotes|section|date=June 2009}}\nMost coaxial cables have a characteristic impedance of either 50, 52, 75, or 93 \u03a9. The RF industry uses standard type-names for coaxial cables.  Thanks to television, [[RG-6]] is the most commonly used coaxial cable for home use, and the majority of connections outside Europe are by [[F connector]]s.\n\nA series of standard types of coaxial cable were specified for [[Army-Navy Equipment Code Designators|military]] uses, in the form \"RG-#\" or \"RG-#/U\". They date from [[World War II]] and were listed in ''MIL-HDBK-216'' published in 1962. These designations are now obsolete. The RG designation stands for Radio Guide; the U designation stands for Universal. The current military standard is [[Defense Standard|MIL-SPEC]] MIL-C-17. MIL-C-17 numbers, such as \"M17/75-RG214\", are given for military cables and manufacturer's catalog numbers for civilian applications. However, the RG-series designations were so common for generations that they are still used, although critical users should be aware that since the handbook is withdrawn there is no standard to guarantee the electrical and physical characteristics of a cable described as \"RG-# type\". The RG designators are mostly used to identify compatible [[electrical connector|connector]]s that fit the inner conductor, dielectric, and jacket dimensions of the old RG-series cables.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:97%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Type\n! rowspan=2 data-sort-type=\"number\" | [[Characteristic impedance|Impedance]]<br />(ohms)\n! rowspan=2 | Core (mm)\n! colspan=4 data-sort-type=\"number\" | Dielectric\n! colspan=2 data-sort-type=\"number\" | Outside diameter\n! rowspan=2 | Shields\n! rowspan=2 style=\"width:250px;\" | Remarks\n! rowspan=2 data-sort-type=\"number\" | Max. attenuation, 750&nbsp;MHz <br/>(dB/100&nbsp;ft)\n|-\n!

While formerly common for implementing [[computer network]]s, in particular [[Ethernet]] (\"thick\" [[10BASE5]] and \"thin\" [[10BASE2]]), [[twisted pair]] cables have replaced them in most applications except in the growing consumer [[cable modem]] market for [[broadband Internet access]].\n\nLong distance coaxial cable was used in the 20th century to connect [[radio network]]s, [[television network]]s, and [[L-carrier|Long Distance telephone]] networks though this has largely been superseded by later methods ([[fibre optics]], [[T-carrier|T1]]/[[E-carrier|E1]], [[satellite]]).\n\nShorter coaxials still carry [[cable television]] signals to the majority of television receivers, and this purpose consumes the majority of coaxial cable production. In 1980s and early 1990s coaxial cable was also used in [[computer networking]], most prominently in [[Ethernet]] networks, where it was later in late 1990s to early 2000s replaced by [[Unshielded twisted pair|UTP]] cables in North America and [[Shielded twisted pair|STP]] cables in Western Europe, both with 8P8C modular connectors.\n\nMicro coaxial cables are used in a range of consumer devices, military equipment, and also in ultra-sound scanning equipment.\n\nThe most common impedances that are widely used are 50 or 52 ohms, and 75 ohms, although other impedances are available for specific applications. The 50 / 52 ohm cables are widely used for industrial and commercial [[two-way radio]] frequency applications (including radio, and telecommunications), although 75 ohms is commonly used for [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] television and radio.\n\nCoax cable is often used to carry data/signals from an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] to a receiver\u2014from a [[satellite dish]] to a satellite receiver, from a [[television antenna]] to a [[television receiver]], from a [[radio mast]] to a [[radio receiver]], etc.\nIn many cases, the same single coax cable carries power in the opposite direction, to the antenna, to power the [[low-noise amplifier]].\nIn some cases a single coax cable carries (unidirectional) power and bidirectional data/signals, as in [[DiSEqC]].\n\n==Types==\n\n===Hard line===\n[[File:Coaxialcableoneandfifthofan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|{{convert|1+5/8|in|abbr=on}} flexible line]]\n[[File:CDMA_Cell_antenna.jpg|thumb|right|200px|1-5/8\" Heliax coaxial cable]]\nHard line is used in [[broadcasting]] as well as many other forms of [[radio]] [[communication]]. It is a coaxial cable constructed using round copper, silver or gold tubing or a combination of such metals as a shield. Some lower-quality hard line may use aluminum shielding, aluminum however is easily oxidized and unlike silver oxide, aluminum oxide drastically loses effective conductivity. Therefore, all connections must be air and water tight. The center conductor may consist of solid copper, or copper-plated aluminum. Since skin effect is an issue with RF, copper plating provides sufficient surface for an effective conductor.  Most varieties of hardline used for external chassis or when exposed to the elements have a PVC jacket; however, some internal applications may omit the insulation jacket. Hard line can be very thick, typically at least a half inch or 13&nbsp;mm and up to several times that, and has low loss even at high power. These large-scale hard lines are almost always used in the connection between a [[transmitter]] on the ground and the [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] or aerial on a tower. Hard line may also be known by trademarked names such as Heliax ([[CommScope]]),<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.commscope.com/Product-Catalog/Wireless/Brand/Fiber-to-the-Antenna-(FTTA)/HELIAX--FiberFeed-/\n|title=CommScope Heliax\n|access-date=2016-06-28\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160628122045/http://www.commscope.com/Product-Catalog/Wireless/Brand/Fiber-to-the-Antenna-(FTTA)/HELIAX--FiberFeed-/\n|archive-date=2016-06-28\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref> or Cablewave (RFS/Cablewave).<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.rfsworld.com/\n|title=Cablewave Radio Frequency Systems <http://www.rfsworld.com>\n}}</ref> Larger varieties of hardline may have a center conductor that is constructed from either rigid or corrugated copper tubing. The dielectric in hard line may consist of polyethylene foam, air, or a pressurized gas such as [[nitrogen]] or desiccated air (dried air). In gas-charged lines, hard plastics such as nylon are used as spacers to separate the inner and outer conductors. The addition of these gases into the dielectric space reduces moisture contamination, provides a stable dielectric constant, and provides a reduced risk of internal [[Electric arc|arc]]ing. Gas-filled hardlines are usually used on high-power [[Radio frequency|RF]] transmitters such as television or radio broadcasting, military transmitters, and high-power [[amateur radio]] applications but may also be used on some critical lower-power applications such as those in the microwave bands. However, in the microwave region, ''[[waveguide]]'' is more often used than hard line for transmitter-to-antenna, or antenna-to-receiver applications. The various shields used in hardline also differ; some forms use rigid tubing, or pipe, while others may use a corrugated tubing, which makes bending easier, as well as reduces kinking when the cable is bent to conform. Smaller varieties of hard line may be used internally in some high-frequency applications, in particular in equipment within the microwave range, to reduce interference between stages of the device.\n\n===Radiating===\n{{Main article|Leaky feeder}}\n'''Radiating''' or '''leaky cable''' is another form of coaxial cable which is constructed in a similar fashion to hard line, however it is constructed with tuned slots cut into the shield. These slots are tuned to the specific RF wavelength of operation or tuned to a specific radio frequency band. This type of cable is to provide a tuned bi-directional \"desired\" leakage effect between transmitter and receiver. It is often used in elevator shafts, US Navy Ships, underground transportation tunnels and in other areas where an antenna is not feasible.  One example of this type of cable is Radiax ([[CommScope]]).<ref>{{cite web\n|url= http://www.commscope.com/Product-Catalog/Wireless/Brand/RADIAX-/\n|title= CommScope Radiax\n|access-date= 2016-06-28\n|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160530224242/http://www.commscope.com/Product-Catalog/Wireless/Brand/RADIAX-/\n|archive-date= 2016-05-30\n|url-status= dead\n}}</ref>\n\n===RG-6===\n{{Main article|RG-6}}\n'''RG-6''' is available in four different types designed for various applications.  In addition, the core may be copper clad steel (CCS) or bare solid copper (BC).  \"Plain\" or \"house\" RG-6 is designed for indoor or external house wiring. \"Flooded\" cable is infused with waterblocking gel for use in underground conduit or direct burial. \"Messenger\" may contain some waterproofing but is distinguished by the addition of a steel [[messenger wire]] along its length to carry the tension involved in an aerial drop from a utility pole.  \"[[plenum cable|Plenum]]\" cabling is expensive and comes with a special Teflon-based outer jacket designed for use in ventilation ducts to meet fire codes. It was developed since the plastics used as the outer jacket and inner insulation in many \"Plain\" or \"house\" cabling gives off poisonous gas when burned.\n\n===Triaxial cable===\n{{Main article|Triaxial cable}}\n'''Triaxial cable''' or '''triax''' is coaxial cable with a third layer of shielding, insulation and sheathing. The outer shield, which is earthed (grounded), protects the inner shield from electromagnetic interference from outside sources.\n\n===Twin-axial cable===\n{{Main article|Twinaxial cabling}}\n'''Twin-axial cable''' or '''twinax''' is a balanced, twisted pair within a cylindrical shield. It allows a nearly perfect differential mode signal which is ''both'' shielded ''and'' balanced to pass through. Multi-conductor coaxial cable is also sometimes used.\n\n===Semi-rigid===\n[[File:Semi-Rigid Coax.png|thumb|right|Semi-Rigid coax assembly]]\n[[File:Semi-Rigid Coax Installed.jpg|thumb|right|Semi-Rigid coax installed in an Agilent N9344C 20GHz spectrum analyser]]\n'''Semi-rigid''' cable is a coaxial form using a solid copper outer sheath. This type of coax offers superior screening compared to cables with a braided outer conductor, especially at higher frequencies. The major disadvantage is that the cable, as its name implies, is not very flexible, and is not intended to be flexed after initial forming. (See \"hard line\")\n\nConformable cable is a flexible reformable alternative to semi-rigid coaxial cable used where flexibility is required. Conformable cable can be stripped and formed by hand without the need for specialized tools, similar to standard coaxial cable.\n\n===Rigid line===\n'''Rigid line''' is a coaxial line formed by two copper tubes maintained concentric every other meter using PTFE-supports. Rigid lines cannot be bent, so they often need elbows. Interconnection with rigid line is done with an inner bullet/inner support and a flange or connection kit. Typically, rigid lines are connected using standardised [[EIA RF Connectors]] whose bullet and flange sizes match the standard line diameters. For each outer diameter, either 75 or 50&nbsp;ohm inner tubes can be obtained. \nRigid line is commonly used indoors for interconnection between high power transmitters and other RF-components, but more rugged rigid line with weatherproof flanges is used outdoors on antenna masts, etc. In the interests of saving weight and costs, on masts and similar structures the outer line is often aluminium, and special care must be taken to prevent corrosion.\nWith a flange connector, it is also possible to go from rigid line to hard line. Many broadcasting antennas and antenna splitters use the flanged rigid line interface even when connecting to flexible coaxial cables and hard line.\nRigid line is produced in a number of different sizes:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Size\n! colspan=2 | Outer conductor\n! colspan=2 | Inner conductor\n|-\n!

This cable had a 1&nbsp;mm copper core, air-spaced polyethylene dielectric and copper braid on an aluminium foil shield. When installed outdoors without protection, the cable was affected by UV radiation, which cracked the PVC outer sheath and allowed moisture ingress. The combination of copper, aluminium, moisture and air caused rapid corrosion, sometimes resulting in a 'snake swallowed an egg' appearance. Consequently, despite the higher cost, the RG6 cable was dropped in favour of CT100 when BSKYB launched its digital broadcasts.\n\nFrom around 1999 to 2005 (when CT100 manufacturer Raydex went out of business), CT100 remained the 75 ohm cable of choice for satellite TV and especially BskyB. It had an air-spaced polyethylene dielectric, a 1&nbsp;mm solid copper core and copper braid on copper foil shield. CT63 was a thinner cable in 'shotgun' style, meaning that it was two cables moulded together and was used mainly by BskyB for the twin connection required by the ''Sky+'' satellite TV receiver, which incorporated a hard drive recording system and a second, independent tuner.\n\nIn 2005, these cables were replaced by WF100 and WF65, respectively, manufactured by Webro and having a similar construction but a foam dielectric that provided the same electrical performance as air-spaced but was more robust and less likely to be crushed.\n\nAt the same time, with the price of copper steadily rising, the original RG6 was dropped in favour of a construction that used a copper-clad steel core and aluminium braid on aluminium foil. Its lower price made it attractive to aerial installers looking for a replacement for the so-called ''low-loss'' cable traditionally used for UK terrestrial aerial installations. This cable had been manufactured with a decreasing number of strands of braid, as the price of copper increased, such that the shielding performance of cheaper brands had fallen to as low as 40 percent. With the advent of digital terrestrial transmissions in the UK, this low-loss cable was no longer suitable.\n\nThe new RG6 still performed well at high frequencies because of the skin effect in the copper cladding. However, the aluminium shield had a high DC resistance and the steel core an even higher one. The result is that this type of cable could not reliably be used in satellite TV installations, where it was required to carry a significant amount of current, because the voltage drop affected the operation of the low noise block downconverter (LNB) on the dish.\n\nA problem with all the aforementioned cables, when passing current, is that electrolytic corrosion can occur in the connections unless moisture and air are excluded. Consequently, various solutions to exclude moisture have been proposed. The first was to seal the connection by wrapping it with self-amalgamating rubberised tape, which bonds to itself when activated by stretching. The second proposal, by the American Channel Master company (now owned by Andrews corp.) at least as early as 1999, was to apply [[silicone grease]] to the wires making connection. The third proposal was to fit a self-sealing plug to the cable. All of these methods are reasonably successful if implemented correctly.\n\n==Interference and troubleshooting==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}\nCoaxial cable insulation may degrade, requiring replacement of the cable, especially if it has been exposed to the elements on a continuous basis. The shield is normally grounded, and if even a single thread of the braid or filament of foil touches the center conductor, the signal will be shorted causing significant or total signal loss. This most often occurs at improperly installed end connectors and splices. Also, the connector or splice must be properly attached to the shield, as this provides the path to ground for the interfering signal.\n\nDespite being shielded, interference can occur on coaxial cable lines.  Susceptibility to interference has little relationship to broad cable type designations (e.g. RG-59, RG-6) but is strongly related to the composition and configuration of the cable's shielding.  For [[cable television]], with frequencies extending well into the UHF range, a foil shield is normally provided, and will provide total coverage as well as high effectiveness against high-frequency interference.  Foil shielding is ordinarily accompanied by a tinned copper or aluminum braid shield, with anywhere from 60 to 95% coverage.  The braid is important to shield effectiveness because (1) it is more effective than foil at preventing low-frequency interference, (2) it provides higher conductivity to ground than foil, and (3) it makes attaching a connector easier and more reliable.  \"Quad-shield\" cable, using two low-coverage aluminum braid shields and two layers of foil, is often used in situations involving troublesome interference, but is less effective than a single layer of foil and single high-coverage copper braid shield such as is found on broadcast-quality precision video cable.\n\nIn the [[United States]] and some other countries, [[cable television]] distribution systems use extensive networks of outdoor coaxial cable, often with in-line distribution amplifiers.  Leakage of signals into and out of cable TV systems can cause interference to cable subscribers and to over-the-air radio services using the same frequencies as those of the cable system.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:WNBC-AM early coaxial feedline.jpg|thumb|Early coaxial antenna feedline of 50 kW radio station [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]], New York, in 1930s]]\n[[File:AT&T coaxial trunkline 1949.jpg|thumb|upright|AT&T coaxial cable trunkline installed between East Coast and Midwest in 1948.

At that time, [[Perth]], the capital of [[Western Australia]], was isolated from the remaining [[Australian states|Australian States]] by thousands of miles of desert terrain and the only practicable method of transport was by sea, a time-consuming, inconvenient and often uncomfortable voyage across the [[Great Australian Bight]], a stretch of water known for rough seas. One of the inducements held out to Western Australians to join the new federation was the promise of a federally funded railway line linking Western Australia with the rest of the continent.\n\nIn 1907 legislation was passed, allowing for the route to be surveyed. The survey was completed in 1909 and proposed a route from [[Port Augusta railway station|Port Augusta]] (the existing railhead at the head of [[Spencer Gulf]] in South Australia's wheatfields) via [[Tarcoola railway station|Tarcoola]] to the gold mining centre of [[Kalgoorlie railway station|Kalgoorlie]] in Western Australia, a distance of {{convert|1063|miles|km}}. The line was to be to the [[standard gauge]] of {{RailGauge|4ft8.5in}}, even though the state railway systems at both ends were [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] at the time. Its cost was estimated at \u00a34,045,000.\n\nLegislation authorising the construction was passed in December 1911 by the [[Andrew Fisher]] Government and work commenced in September 1912 in [[Port Augusta]].\n\nWork proceeded eastwards from [[Kalgoorlie]] and westwards from Port Augusta through the years of the First World War.

Crossing loops have self restoring points, so that points are reset to the straight route when a train departs from a crossing loop. The loops are fitted with radio controls so that train crew can set the points as they approach.

In the days of steam locomotion, about half the total load was water for the engine.\n\nAccording to Adelaide-born astronaut [[Andy Thomas]], the line is identifiable from space, because of its unnatural straightness. \"It's a very fine line, it's like someone has drawn a very fine pencil line across the desert,\" he has said.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Debelle|first1=Penelope|title=Adelaide's own spaceman Andy Thomas|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/lifestyle/sa-lifestyle/adelaides-own-spaceman-andy-thomas/story-fnizi7vf-1227086757447|accessdate=19 October 2014|work=The Advertiser|location=Adelaide|date=10 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Names of stopping places==\n{{see also|List of localities and stopping places related to the Trans Australian railway line}}\nMost of the stopping locations in the 129\u00b0 E to 134\u00b0 E part of the railway in South Australia (except for Deakin, which is {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} inside Western Australia's state border) were named after the first seven [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Ministers]].\n\n{|class=wikitable\n!Location\n!Name of Prime Minister\n!Prime Minister number\n!Distance from [[Port Augusta railway station|Port Augusta]] in km (mi)<ref>(1927)  \t''Travel in comfort across Australia on the Trans-Australian Railway.''\nMelbourne : Commonwealth Railways. internal map titled ''Map shewing Connections between Capital Cities via Trans- Australian Railway''</ref>\n|-\n|Barton, South Australia\n|[[Edmund Barton]]\n|First \n|605.11 (376) \n|-\n|[[Watson, South Australia]]\n|[[Chris Watson]]\n|Third \n|716.16 (445)\n|-\n| Fisher, South Australia \n|[[Andrew Fisher]] \n|Fifth \n|770.88 (479) \n|-\n|[[Cook, South Australia]]\n|[[Joseph Cook]]\n|Sixth\n|825.59 (513) \n|-\n|Hughes, South Australia\n|[[Billy Hughes]] \n|Seventh \n|912.5 (567)\n|-\n|[[Deakin, Western Australia]]\n|[[Alfred Deakin]]\n|Second\n|964 (599)\n|-\n|Reid, Western Australia\n|[[George Reid (Australian politician)|George Reid]] \n|Fourth  \n|1,017.11 (632) This station is west of Deakin.\n|}\n\nOther federal ministers from the 1900\u20131917 era occur outside of this sequence amongst stopping places on the rail route.\n\n==Operations==\n[[File:GM29 Rawlinna, 1986.JPG|250px|thumb|[[Commonwealth Railways GM class|GM29 and GM3]] with an [[Adelaide Parklands Terminal|Adelaide]] bound ''[[Trans Australian]]'' at [[Rawlinna]] in 1986]]\nBecause of the inevitable problems of finding suitable water for [[steam locomotive]]s in a desert, the original engineer, [[Henry Deane (engineer)|Henry Deane]] envisaged [[diesel locomotive]]s for the line.

{"title_page": "Semkenfahrt", "text_new": "The '''Semkenfahrt''' is part of a canal system in [[Germany]].  It was used in former times (about 1750 to 1918) by [[barges]] to bring [[peat]] from the [[Teufelsmoor]] area to the town of [[Bremen]]. In the area of Teufelsmoor the peat was dug and dried, and in Bremen it was used for heating purposes.\n\n[[File:Semkenfahrt - Bremen - 2010.jpg|thumb|300px|The Neue Semkenfahrt canal in Blockland in Bremen, Germany (photo Till F. Teenck)]]\n''Semkenfahrt'' denotes three parts of the canal system: the ''Alte Semkenfahrt'' (= Old Semkenfahrt), the ''Semkenfahrtkanal'' (= Semkenfahrt canal), and the ''Neue Semkenfahrt'' (= New Semkenfahrt). The word ''Semkenfahrt'' originated from ''Semken'', the surname of a family who gave the land to build the canal, and ''Fahrt'' which means a navigable channel in the nautical sense.\n\n== History of the Semkenfahrt ==\n\nWith a barge carrying peat from [[Worpswede]] bound for Bremen, a [[skipper (boating)|skipper]] had to use the rivers [[Hamme (river)|Hamme]], [[Lesum]] and [[W\u00fcmme]]. The journey took about three to four days. In the year 1754 a project was started to connect the newly founded village of T\u00fcschendorf with the river Hamme. The canal, called ''Alte Semkenfahrt'', had to make an arc to pass the hill of [[Weyerberg]], then joining the river Hamme.\n\nWhile the [[Torfschiffswerft Schlussdorf#Turf boats|peat barges]] were in the Semkenfahrt they had to be hauled. On reaching the river Hamme, if the wind came from an easterly direction, the skipper could use [[sail]]. But in North Germany the wind comes mostly from the west, so for the most part the skipper could set the sails only on the way back, when the barges were empty. On the way to Bremen they mostly had to [[punt (boat)|punt]] or to [[scull]].\n\nThe peat barge traffic reached its peak at the end of the 19th century. For example, in the year 1880, 25,000 shiploads reached Bremen. About 5,000 to 6,000 of these shiploads used the Semkenfahrt.  The cargo was in total approximately 30,000 to 36,000 cubic meters in volume.\n\n== Alte Semkenfahrt - Old Semkenfahrt ==\n\n(Start: {{coord|53|14|3.1|N|9|1|11.5|E|type:waterbody}}; End: {{coord|53|13|6.36|N|8|52|4.82|E|type:waterbody}})\n\nIn 1754 the Alte Semkenfahrt was dug, beginning at the village of [http://www.grasberg.de/default.cfm?mid=29574 T\u00fcschendorf], and passing the villages of Adolphsdorf, Otterstein, Mooringen, Worpheim, and Waakhausen, and then joining the river Hamme. Today only the part from Waakhausen to the Hamme can be used by canoes. The remaining parts are now too small for canoes. Today the Semkenfahrt between Waakhausen and the river Hamme looks like [https://www.panoramio.com/photo/7241376 this].\n\n== Semkenfahrtkanal - Semkenfahrt canal ==\n\n(Start: {{coord|53|11|36.92|N|8|54|20.54|E|type:waterbody}}; End: {{coord|53|8|51.62|N|8|50|43.32|E|type:waterbody}})\n\nThis part of the Semkenfahrt was established in 1888. It starts at the \"Alte Semkenfahrt\" in [https://www.panoramio.com/photo/51925916 Worpheim] and leads directly to the river W\u00fcmme. It reaches the W\u00fcmme at the inn \"Zur Schleuse\" in the village of Truperdeich. \"Zur Schleuse\" means a [[lock (water transport)|lock]] in the nautical sense, and the inn is thus named because it is located close to the lock by which the barges left the Semkenfahrt and came into the river W\u00fcmme. The lock was necessary because the river W\u00fcmme has a dike to suppress the influence of the tide. This part of the Semkenfahrt very much shortens the route.\n\n== Neue Semkenfahrt - New Semkenfahrt ==\n\n(Start: {{coord|53|8|40.38|N|8|50|47.11|E|type:waterbody}}; End: {{coord|53|7|1|N|8|49|3|E|type:waterbody}})\n\nThis part was established after 1888.

It was used in former times (about 1750 to 1918) by [[barges]] to bring [[peat]] from the [[Teufelsmoor]] area to the town of [[Bremen]]. In the area of Teufelsmoor the peat was dug and dried, and in Bremen it was used for heating purposes.\n\n[[File:Semkenfahrt - Bremen - 2010.jpg|thumb|300px|The Neue Semkenfahrt canal in Blockland in Bremen, Germany (photo Till F. Teenck)]]\n''Semkenfahrt'' denotes three parts of the canal system: the ''Alte Semkenfahrt'' (= Old Semkenfahrt), the ''Semkenfahrtkanal'' (= Semkenfahrt canal), and the ''Neue Semkenfahrt'' (= New Semkenfahrt). The word ''Semkenfahrt'' originated from ''Semken'', the surname of a family who gave the land to build the canal, and ''Fahrt'' which means a navigable channel in the nautical sense.\n\n== History of the Semkenfahrt ==\n\nWith a barge carrying peat from [[Worpswede]] bound for Bremen, a [[skipper (boating)|skipper]] had to use the rivers [[Hamme (river)|Hamme]], [[Lesum]] and [[W\u00fcmme]]. The journey took about three to four days. In the year 1754 a project was started to connect the newly founded village of T\u00fcschendorf with the river Hamme. The canal, called ''Alte Semkenfahrt'', had to make an arc to pass the hill of [[Weyerberg]], then joining the river Hamme.\n\nWhile the peat barges were in the Semkenfahrt they had to be hauled. On reaching the river Hamme, if the wind came from an easterly direction, the skipper could use [[sail]]. But in North Germany the wind comes mostly from the west, so for the most part the skipper could set the sails only on the way back, when the barges were empty. On the way to Bremen they mostly had to [[punt (boat)|punt]] or to [[scull]].\n\nThe peat barge traffic reached its peak at the end of the 19th century. For example, in the year 1880, 25,000 shiploads reached Bremen. About 5,000 to 6,000 of these shiploads used the Semkenfahrt.  The cargo was in total approximately 30,000 to 36,000 cubic meters in volume.\n\n== Alte Semkenfahrt - Old Semkenfahrt ==\n\n(Start: {{coord|53|14|3.1|N|9|1|11.5|E|type:waterbody}}; End: {{coord|53|13|6.36|N|8|52|4.82|E|type:waterbody}})\n\nIn 1754 the Alte Semkenfahrt was dug, beginning at the village of [http://www.grasberg.de/default.cfm?mid=29574 T\u00fcschendorf], and passing the villages of Adolphsdorf, Otterstein, Mooringen, Worpheim, and Waakhausen, and then joining the river Hamme. Today only the part from Waakhausen to the Hamme can be used by canoes. The remaining parts are now too small for canoes. Today the Semkenfahrt between Waakhausen and the river Hamme looks like [https://www.panoramio.com/photo/7241376 this].\n\n== Semkenfahrtkanal - Semkenfahrt canal ==\n\n(Start: {{coord|53|11|36.92|N|8|54|20.54|E|type:waterbody}}; End: {{coord|53|8|51.62|N|8|50|43.32|E|type:waterbody}})\n\nThis part of the Semkenfahrt was established in 1888. It starts at the \"Alte Semkenfahrt\" in [https://www.panoramio.com/photo/51925916 Worpheim] and leads directly to the river W\u00fcmme. It reaches the W\u00fcmme at the inn \"Zur Schleuse\" in the village of Truperdeich. \"Zur Schleuse\" means a [[lock (water transport)|lock]] in the nautical sense, and the inn is thus named because it is located close to the lock by which the barges left the Semkenfahrt and came into the river W\u00fcmme. The lock was necessary because the river W\u00fcmme has a dike to suppress the influence of the tide. This part of the Semkenfahrt very much shortens the route.\n\n== Neue Semkenfahrt - New Semkenfahrt ==\n\n(Start: {{coord|53|8|40.38|N|8|50|47.11|E|type:waterbody}}; End: {{coord|53|7|1|N|8|49|3|E|type:waterbody}})\n\nThis part was established after 1888.  At first it was named ''Neuer Torfkanal''. This part starts on the south bank of the river W\u00fcmme at the ''Gartelmann's Gasthof'' inn.\n\nThe river W\u00fcmme is protected by a [[levee|dike]]. Until 1902 there was no lock available to pass the dike, and the barges had to pass the dike by a slip mechanism, driven by a manually operated winch.\n\nAfter the barges left the Neue Semkenfahrt they came into the ''Torfkanal'' and then it was only a short way to the destination, the Torfhafen (harbour for peat).

They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M.

Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common quotation sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |pages=12-13 |edition=1st ed.}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the vantage point of the reporting speaker (e.g. ''He said: \u201cI am leaving now\u201d'' versus ''He said (that) he was leaving immediately''); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a well-formed declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |pages=12-13 |edition=1st ed.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other interlocutors. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |pages=12-13 |edition=1st ed.}}</ref>\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn spoken language, there are several ways to present a quotation. For example, the speaker may begin with a lead-in that relates a quotation to the topic currently being discussed, which may be followed by supplementary information on the person to be quoted, and finally the quotation itself.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McArthur |first1=Tom |last2=Lam-McArthur |first2=Jacqueline |last3=Fontaine |first3=Lisa |title=The Oxford Companion to the English Language$ The Oxford Companion to the English Language (2 ed.) |date=2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191744389 |edition=2nd}}</ref> The quotation is introduced by a quotative marker.\n\n====Quotative markers====\n===== English =====\nIn English, the verb ''\"be like\"'' or ''\"said\"'' are being used as quotatives in American English. <ref> Frederica Barbieri.

The verb is usually a verb of communication or thought. In spoken Japanese, the use of pronouns and honorific form are commonly seen; yet, honorific form is not an evidence between direct and indirect speech. Thus, Japanese fails to distinguish between direct and indirect speech as shown in the above examples.\n<ref name=\"Coulmas p164\"/>\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\n====Nested quotations====\n====Crosslinguistic variations====\n\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame the quoter's own opinions.<ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69-98 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327?via%3Dihub | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are used to express reported speech, thoughts, or perceptions. <ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are markers equivalent to full verbs with meanings ''say, speak, mention, tell, etc.''\n<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5-25 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u660e\u65e5 !! \u6674\u308c\u308b !! -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u660e\u65e5 !! \u6674\u308c\u308b !! -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 !! \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000!!\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative evidentials=====\nQuotative evidentials provide knowledge of who or where information originated from in speech.

Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2014). On indirect reports and language games: Evidence from Persian. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 8(2), 26-42.</ref><ref>Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2015). The secret life of slurs from the perspective of reported speech. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common quotation sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |pages=12-13 |edition=1st ed.}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations--more specifically known as direct quotations--have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the vantage point of the reporting speaker (e.g. ''He said: \u201cI am leaving now\u201d'' versus ''He said (that) he was leaving immediately''); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a well-formed declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |pages=12-13 |edition=1st ed.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other interlocutors. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |pages=12-13 |edition=1st ed.}}</ref>\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn spoken language, there are several ways to present a quotation. For example, the speaker may begin with a lead-in that relates a quotation to the topic currently being discussed, which may be followed by supplementary information on the person to be quoted, and finally the quotation itself.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McArthur |first1=Tom |last2=Lam-McArthur |first2=Jacqueline |last3=Fontaine |first3=Lisa |title=The Oxford Companion to the English Language$ The Oxford Companion to the English Language (2 ed.) |date=2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191744389 |edition=2nd}}</ref> The quotation is introduced by a quotative marker.\n\n====Quotative markers====\n===== English =====\nIn English, the verb ''\"be like\"'' or ''\"said\"'' are being used as quotatives in American English. <ref> Frederica Barbieri.

The verb is usually a verb of communication or thought. In spoken Japanese, the use of pronouns and honorific form are commonly seen; yet, honorific form is not an evidence between direct and indirect speech. Thus, Japanese fails to distinguish between direct and indirect speech as shown in the above examples.\n<ref name=\"Coulmas p164\"/>\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\n====Nested quotations====\n====Crosslinguistic variations====\n\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame the quoter's own opinions.<ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69-98 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327?via%3Dihub | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are used to express reported speech, thoughts, or perceptions. <ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are markers equivalent to full verbs with meanings ''say, speak, mention, tell, etc.''\n<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5-25 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u660e\u65e5 !! \u6674\u308c\u308b !! -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u660e\u65e5 !! \u6674\u308c\u308b !! -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 !! \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000!!\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative evidentials=====\nQuotative evidentials provide knowledge of who or where information originated from in speech.

The pine\u2013oak forests are found above {{convert|800|m|ft}} in elevation, and are surrounded at lower elevations by the [[Sierra de la Laguna dry forests]]. The pine\u2013oak forests have a unique and diverse flora and fauna, including 694 plant species, of which approximately 85 are [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]].\n\nThe higher elevation gives the ecoregion a subtropical to temperate climate, in contrast to the dry tropical climate of the lowlands. Rainfall is higher than the lower-elevation dry forests and deserts of the peninsula, averaging 760&nbsp;mm annually. Rain falls mostly in the summer, with occasional winter rains.\n\n==Flora==\n{{See also category|Flora of Baja California Sur}}\nThe composition of the [[pine]]\u2013[[oak]] forests varies with elevation; oak [[woodland]]s predominate from {{convert|800|-|1200|m|ft}} in  elevation, with oak-pine woodlands between {{convert|1200|-|1600|m|ft}} in elevation, transitioning to pine\u2013oak forests above {{convert|1600|m|ft}} in elevation. [[Moss]]es and [[lichen]]s are abundant throughout.\n\nThe oak woodlands from {{convert|800|-|1200|m|ft}} in elevation are warmer and drier, with evergreen oaks predominant (principally ''[[Quercus devia]]''; ''[[Quercus arizonica]]'' and ''[[Quercus rugosa]]'' have a limited distribution), along with lower trees and shrubs such as ''[[Dodonaea viscosa]]'', ''[[Sideroxylon peninsulare]]'', and ''[[Buddleia]] crotonoides.''\n\nAbove {{convert|1200|m|ft}} in elevation, the oak woodlands transition to oak-pine forests. The only pine present is an endemic [[subspecies]] of [[Mexican Pinyon]], ''Pinus cembroides'' subsp.

The pine\u2013oak forests are found above {{convert|800|m|ft}} in elevation, and are surrounded at lower elevations by the [[Sierra de la Laguna dry forests]]. The pine\u2013oak forests have a unique and diverse flora and fauna, including 694 plant species, of which approximately 85 are [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]].\n\nThe higher elevation gives the ecoregion a subtropical to temperate climate, in contrast to the dry tropical climate of the lowlands. Rainfall is higher than the lower-elevation dry forests and deserts of the peninsula, averaging 760&nbsp;mm annually. Rain falls mostly in the summer, with occasional winter rains.\n\n==Flora==\n{{See also category|Flora of Baja California Sur}}\nThe composition of the [[pine]]\u2013[[oak]] forests varies with elevation; oak [[woodland]]s predominate from {{convert|800|-|1200|m|ft}} in  elevation, with oak-pine woodlands between {{convert|1200|-|1600|m|ft}} in elevation, transitioning to pine\u2013oak forests above {{convert|1600|m|ft}} in elevation. [[Moss]]es and [[lichen]]s are abundant throughout.\n\nThe oak woodlands from {{convert|800|-|1200|m|ft}} in elevation are warmer and drier, with evergreen oaks predominant (principally ''[[Quercus devia]]''; ''[[Quercus arizonica]]'' and ''[[Quercus rugosa]]'' have a limited distribution), along with lower trees and shrubs such as ''[[Dodonaea viscosa]]'', ''[[Sideroxylon peninsulare]]'', and ''[[Buddleia]] crotonoides.''\n\nAbove {{convert|1200|m|ft}} in elevation, the oak woodlands transition to oak-pine forests. The only pine present is an endemic [[subspecies]] of [[Mexican Pinyon]], ''Pinus cembroides'' subsp. ''lagunae'', mixed with oaks, including ''[[Quercus devia]]'' and ''[[Quercus tuberculata]]'', and other broadleaf trees, including ''[[Arbutus|Arbutus peninsularis]]'' and ''[[Nolina|Nolina beldingi]]''. Lower trees and understory shrubs include ''[[Calliandra|Calliandra peninsularis]]'', ''[[Mimosa|Mimosa xanti]]'', ''[[Heterotoma (plant)|Heterotoma aurita]]'', ''[[Verbesina|Verbesina pustulata]]'' and ''[[Hypericum|Hypericum peninsulare]]''.
