When Cook and his men returned home to Europe from their voyages to [[Polynesia]], they told tales of the 'tattooed savages' they had seen. The word \"tattoo\" itself comes from the [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] ''tatau'', and was introduced into the [[English language]] by Cook's expedition (though the word 'tattoo' or 'tap-too', referring to a drumbeat, had existed in English since at least 1644)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hine|first1=Thomas Chambers|title=Nottingham: its castle: a military fortress, a royal palace, a ducal mansion, a blackened ruin, a museum and gallery of art|date=1876|publisher=Hamilton, Adams|location=London|page=Appendix|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/imgsrv/download/pdf?id=njp.32101075991255;orient=0;size=100;seq=253;attachment=0}}</ref>\n\nIt was in Tahiti aboard the ''[[HMS Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', in July 1769, that Cook first noted his observations about the indigenous body modification and is the first recorded use of the word tattoo to refer to the permanent marking of the skin. In the ship's log book recorded this entry: \"Both sexes paint their Bodys, Tattow, as it is called in their Language. This is done by inlaying the Colour of Black under their skins, in such a manner as to be indelible.\" Cook went on to write, \"This method of Tattowing I shall now describe...As this is a painful operation, especially the Tattowing of their Buttocks, it is performed but once in their Lifetimes.\"\n\nCook's Science Officer and Expedition Botanist, Sir [[Joseph Banks]], returned to England with a tattoo. Banks was a highly regarded member of the English aristocracy and had acquired his position with Cook by putting up what was at the time the princely sum of some ten thousand pounds in the expedition. In turn, Cook brought back with him a tattooed [[Raiatea]]n man, [[Omai]], whom he presented to King George and the English Court. Many of Cook's men, ordinary seamen and sailors, came back with tattoos, a tradition that would soon become associated with men of the sea in the public's mind and the press of the day.<ref>A description of three of the men who took part in the [[Mutiny on the Bounty]] in 1789 refers to their being tattooed on the left breast, arms and 'backside' with designs such as stars, hearts, 'darts' and, in the case of a [[Isle of Man|Manxman]], the [[triskelion]] [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/museum/additional_image_types.asp?extra_image_type_id=2&image_id=39 nationalarchives.gov.uk]</ref> In the process, sailors and seamen re-introduced the practice of tattooing in Europe, and it spread rapidly to seaports around the globe.\n\nBy the 19th century, tattooing had spread to British society but was still largely associated with sailors<ref>\"The reason why sailors tattoo themselves has often been asked.\" The Times (London), 30 January 1873, p. 10: The article describes recovery of bodies after a shipwreck:those of the crew were identifiable by their tattoos.</ref> and the lower or even criminal class.<ref>''The Times'' (London), 3 April 1879, p. 9: \"Crime has a ragged regiment in its pay so far as the outward ... qualities are concerned ... they tattoo themselves indelibly ... asserting the man's identity with the aid of needles and gunpowder.

Taking their lead from the British Court, where [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] followed [[Edward VII|Edward VII's]] lead in getting tattooed; King [[Frederick IX of Denmark|Frederick IX]] of [[Denmark]], the King of [[Romania]], [[Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]], [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander of Yugoslavia]] and even [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] of [[Russia]], all sported tattoos, many of them elaborate and ornate renditions of the Royal Coat of Arms or the Royal Family Crest. [[King Alfonso XIII]] of modern [[Spain]] also had a tattoo.\n\nThe perception that there is a marked class division on the acceptability of the practice has been a popular media theme in Britain, as successive generations of journalists described the practice as newly fashionable and no longer for a marginalised class. Examples of this clich\u00e9 can be found in every decade since the 1870s.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cawley|first1=Lawrence|title=People always say the same thing about tattoos|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25330947|work=BBC News Magazine|publisher=BBC|date=3 February 2014}}</ref> Despite this evidence, a myth persists that the upper and lower classes find tattooing attractive and the broader middle classes rejecting it. In 1969, the [[House of Lords]] debated a bill to ban the tattooing of minors, on grounds it had become \"trendy\" with the young in recent years but was associated with crime. It was noted that 40 per cent of young criminals had tattoos and that marking the skin in this way tended to encourage self-identification with criminal groups. Two peers, [[Baron Teynham|Lord Teynham]] and the [[Dudley Gordon, 3rd Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair]] however rose to object that they had been tattooed as youngsters, with no ill effects.<ref>''The Times'' (London), 29 April 1969, p. 4: \"Saving young from embarrassing tattoos\".</ref> Since the 1970s, tattoos have become more socially acceptable and fashionable among celebrities.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24296713|title=Why do people go back for more and more tattoos?|first=Jon|last=Kelly|date=1 October 2013|via=www.bbc.co.uk|work=BBC News}}</ref> Tattoos are less prominent on figures of authority, and the practice of tattooing by the elderly is still considered remarkable.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24906132|title=Dimbleby gets first tattoo aged 75|date=12 November 2013|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n===India===\n\nIn Southern [[India]], permanent tattoos are called ''pachakuthu''. It was very common in [[South India]], especially [[Tamil Nadu]], before 1980. In northern India, permanent tattoos are called ''godna''.

Generally firemen, manual workers and prostitutes wore tattoos to communicate their status.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} By the early 17th century, criminals were widely being tattooed as a visible mark of punishment. Criminals were marked with symbols typically including crosses, lines, double lines and circles on certain parts of the body, mostly the face and arms. These symbols sometimes designated the places where the crimes were committed. In one area, the character for \"dog\" was tattooed on the criminal's forehead.<ref name=Gilbert2000 />{{rp|77}}<ref>{{cite web|title=A history of Japanese tattooing|url=http://www.vanishingtattoo.com/tattoo_museum/chinese_japanese_tattoos.html|website=vanishingtattoo.com|accessdate=21 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Government of Meiji Japan]], formed in 1868, banned the art of tattooing altogether, viewing it as barbaric and lacking respectability. This subsequently created a subculture of criminals and outcasts. These people had no place in \"decent society\" and were frowned upon. They could not simply integrate into mainstream society because of their obvious visible tattoos, forcing many of them into criminal activities which ultimately formed the roots for the modern Japanese mafia, the Yakuza, with which tattoos have become almost synonymous in Japan.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n===North Africa===\n\n====Egypt and Nubia====\nDespite a lack of direct textual references, tattooed human remains and iconographic evidence indicate that [[ancient Egypt]]ians practiced tattooing from at least 2000 BCE.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-01|title=Natural mummies from Predynastic Egypt reveal the world's earliest figural tattoos|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|language=en|volume=92|pages=116\u2013125|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2018.02.002|issn=0305-4403|last1=Friedman|first1=Ren\u00e9e|last2=Antoine|first2=Daniel|last3=Talamo|first3=Sahra|last4=Reimer|first4=Paula J.|last5=Taylor|first5=John H.|last6=Wills|first6=Barbara|last7=Mannino|first7=Marcello A.|url=https://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/natural-mummies-from-predynastic-egypt-reveal-the-worlds-earliest-figural-tattoos(8a368c3c-d138-4a04-a203-fef01b8ed673).html}}</ref><ref name=Tassie2003>{{cite journal|last=Tassie|first=Geoffrey J.|title=Identifying the practice of tattooing in ancient Egypt and Nubia|journal=Papers from the Institute of Archaeology|date=2003|volume=14|pages=85\u2013101|doi=10.5334/pia.200}}</ref>{{rp|86,89}} It is theorized that tattooing entered Egypt through [[Nubia]],<ref name=Bianchi1988>{{cite book|last=Bianchi|first=Robert S.|editor-last=Rubin|editor-first=Arnold|title= Marks of civilization: Artistic transformations of the human body|date=1988|chapter=Tattoo in ancient Egypt|publisher=Museum of Cultural History, University of California, Los Angeles|location=Los Angeles, CA|isbn=978-0-930741-12-9|pages=21\u201328|chapter-format=Paperback}}</ref>{{rp|23}} but this claim is complicated by the high mobility between Lower Nubia and [[Upper Egypt]] as well as Egypt's [[annexation]] of Lower Nubia during the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]].<ref name=Tassie2003 />{{rp|92}} Archeologist Geoffrey J.

Tools and techniques have changed little. The skill is often passed from father to son, each [[tattoo]] artist, or tufuga, learning the craft over many years of serving as his father's apprentice. A young artist-in-training often spent hours, and sometimes days, tapping designs into sand or tree bark using a special [[tattooing]] comb, or au. Honoring their tradition, Samoan tattoo artists made this tool from sharpened boar's teeth fastened together with a portion of the turtle shell and to a wooden handle. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nTraditional Samoan tattooing of the \"pe'a\", body tattoo, is an ordeal that is not lightly undergone. It takes many weeks to complete. The process is very painful and used to be a necessary prerequisite to receiving a matai title; this however is no longer the case. [[Tattooing]] was also a very costly procedure.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nSamoan society has long been defined by rank and title, with chiefs (ali'i) and their assistants, known as talking chiefs (tulafale). The tattooing ceremonies for young chiefs, typically conducted at the time of puberty, were part of their ascendance to a leadership role. The permanent marks left by the [[tattoo]] artists would forever celebrate their endurance and dedication to cultural traditions. The pain was extreme and the risk of death by infection was a concern; to back down from tattooing was to risk being labeled a \"pala'ai\" or coward. Those who could not endure the pain and abandoned their tattooing were left incomplete, would be forced to wear their mark of shame throughout their life. This would forever bring shame upon their family so it was avoided at all cost. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nThe Samoan tattooing process used a number of tools which remained almost unchanged since their first use. \"Autapulu\" is a wide tattooing comb used to fill in the large dark areas of the tattoo. \"Ausogi'aso tele\" is a comb used for making thick lines. \"Ausogi'aso laititi\" is a comb used for making thin lines. \"Aumogo\" small comb is used for making small marks. \"Sausau\" is the mallet is used for striking the combs. It is almost two feet in length and made from the central rib of a coconut palm leaf. \"Tuluma\" is the pot used for holding the tattooing combs. Ipulama is the cup used for holding the dye. The dye is made from the soot collected from burnt lama nuts. \"Tu'I\"  used to grind up the dye. These tools were primarily made out of animal bones to ensure sharpness.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nThe tattooing process itself would be 5 sessions, in theory. These 5 sessions would be spread out over 10 days in order for the inflammation to subside.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nChristian missionaries from the west attempted to purge tattooing among the Samoans, thinking it barbaric and inhumane. Many young Samoans resisted mission schools since they forbade them to wear tattoos. But over time attitudes relaxed toward this cultural tradition and tattooing began to reemerge in Samoan culture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n[[File:Scythian tatoo.jpg|thumb|upright|A tattoo on the right arm of a [[Scythian]] chieftain whose mummy was discovered at [[Ukok Plateau|Pazyryk]], [[Russia]].

Stevens Wagner]], one of the earliest [[Tattooed Ladies]] that performed in the circus sideshows, 1907]]\n\nIn the period shortly after the [[American Revolution]], to avoid [[impressment]] by British Navy ships, sailors used government issued [[protection papers]] to establish their American citizenship. However, many of the descriptions of the individual described in the seamen's protection certificates were so general, and it was so easy to abuse the system, that many impressment officers of the [[Royal Navy]] simply paid no attention to them. \"In applying for a duplicate Seaman's Protection Certificate in 1817, James Francis stated that he 'had a protection granted him by the Collector of this Port on or about 12 March 1806 which was torn up and destroyed by a British Captain when at sea.'\"<ref>[https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1992/spring/seamans-protection.html \"Genealogical Fallout from the War of 1812.\"] By Ruth Priest Dixon. Prologue Magazine. Spring 1992. Volume 24 (1).</ref>\n\nOne way of making them more specific and more effective was to describe a tattoo, which is highly personal as to subject and location, and thus use that description to precisely identify the seaman. As a result, many of the official certificates also carried information about tattoos and scars, as well as any other specific identifying information. This also perhaps led to an increase and proliferation of tattoos among American seamen who wanted to avoid impressment. During this period, tattoos were not popular with the rest of the country. \"Frequently the \"protection papers\" made reference to tattoos, clear evidence that individual was a seafaring man; rarely did members of the general public adorn themselves with tattoos.\"<ref>Smith, Gene Allan. 2013. The Slave's Gamble. MacMillan. Page 55.</ref> he is for you\n\n\"In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, [[tattoo]]s were as much about self-expression as they were about having a unique way to identify a sailor's body should he be lost at sea or impressed by the British navy. The best source for early American tattoos is the [[protection papers]] issued following a 1796 congressional act to safeguard American seamen from impressment. These proto-[[passport]]s catalogued tattoos alongside [[birthmark]]s, [[scar]]s, race, and height. Using simple techniques and tools, tattoo artists in the early republic typically worked on board ships using anything available as [[pigment]]s, even [[gunpowder]] and [[urine]].

When Cook and his men returned home to Europe from their voyages to [[Polynesia]], they told tales of the 'tattooed savages' they had seen. The word \"tattoo\" itself comes from the [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] ''tatau'', and was introduced into the [[English language]] by Cook's expedition (though the word 'tattoo' or 'tap-too', referring to a drumbeat, had existed in English since at least 1644)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hine|first1=Thomas Chambers|title=Nottingham: its castle: a military fortress, a royal palace, a ducal mansion, a blackened ruin, a museum and gallery of art|date=1876|publisher=Hamilton, Adams|location=London|page=Appendix|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/imgsrv/download/pdf?id=njp.32101075991255;orient=0;size=100;seq=253;attachment=0}}</ref>\n\nIt was in Tahiti aboard the ''[[HMS Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', in July 1769, that Cook first noted his observations about the indigenous body modification and is the first recorded use of the word tattoo to refer to the permanent marking of the skin. In the ship's log book recorded this entry: \"Both sexes paint their Bodys, Tattow, as it is called in their Language. This is done by inlaying the Colour of Black under their skins, in such a manner as to be indelible.\" Cook went on to write, \"This method of Tattowing I shall now describe...As this is a painful operation, especially the Tattowing of their Buttocks, it is performed but once in their Lifetimes.\"\n\nCook's Science Officer and Expedition Botanist, Sir [[Joseph Banks]], returned to England with a tattoo. Banks was a highly regarded member of the English aristocracy and had acquired his position with Cook by putting up what was at the time the princely sum of some ten thousand pounds in the expedition. In turn, Cook brought back with him a tattooed [[Raiatea]]n man, [[Omai]], whom he presented to King George and the English Court. Many of Cook's men, ordinary seamen and sailors, came back with tattoos, a tradition that would soon become associated with men of the sea in the public's mind and the press of the day.<ref>A description of three of the men who took part in the [[Mutiny on the Bounty]] in 1789 refers to their being tattooed on the left breast, arms and 'backside' with designs such as stars, hearts, 'darts' and, in the case of a [[Isle of Man|Manxman]], the [[triskelion]] [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/museum/additional_image_types.asp?extra_image_type_id=2&image_id=39 nationalarchives.gov.uk]</ref> In the process, sailors and seamen re-introduced the practice of tattooing in Europe, and it spread rapidly to seaports around the globe.\n\nBy the 19th century, tattooing had spread to British society but was still largely associated with sailors<ref>\"The reason why sailors tattoo themselves has often been asked.\" The Times (London), 30 January 1873, p. 10: The article describes recovery of bodies after a shipwreck:those of the crew were identifiable by their tattoos.</ref> and the lower or even criminal class.<ref>''The Times'' (London), 3 April 1879, p. 9: \"Crime has a ragged regiment in its pay so far as the outward ... qualities are concerned ... they tattoo themselves indelibly ... asserting the man's identity with the aid of needles and gunpowder.

[[King Alfonso XIII]] of modern [[Spain]] also had a tattoo.\n\nThe perception that there is a marked class division on the acceptability of the practice has been a popular media theme in Britain, as successive generations of journalists described the practice as newly fashionable and no longer for a marginalised class.

Traditional t\u0101 moko was reserved for head area. There is also a related tattoo art, kirituhi, which has a similar aesthetic to t\u0101 moko but is worn by non-Maori.\n\n====Samoa====\nThe traditional male tattoo in Samoa is called the [[pe'a]]. The traditional female tattoo is called the [[malu]]. The word ''tattoo'' is believed to have originated from the Samoan word ''tatau.'' {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nWhen the [[Samoan Islands]] were first seen by Europeans in 1722 three Dutch ships commanded by Jacob Roggeveen visited the eastern island known as Manua. A crew member of one of the ships described the natives in these words, \"They are friendly in their speech and courteous in their behavior, with no apparent trace of wildness or savagery. They do not paint themselves, as do the natives of some other islands, but on the lower part of the body they wear artfully woven silk tights or knee breeches.

Tools and techniques have changed little. The skill is often passed from father to son, each [[tattoo]] artist, or tufuga, learning the craft over many years of serving as his father's apprentice. A young artist-in-training often spent hours, and sometimes days, tapping designs into sand or tree bark using a special [[tattooing]] comb, or au. Honoring their tradition, Samoan tattoo artists made this tool from sharpened boar's teeth fastened together with a portion of the turtle shell and to a wooden handle. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nTraditional Samoan tattooing of the \"pe'a\", body tattoo, is an ordeal that is not lightly undergone. It takes many weeks to complete. The process is very painful and used to be a necessary prerequisite to receiving a matai title; this however is no longer the case. [[Tattooing]] was also a very costly procedure.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nSamoan society has long been defined by rank and title, with chiefs (ali'i) and their assistants, known as talking chiefs (tulafale). The tattooing ceremonies for young chiefs, typically conducted at the time of puberty, were part of their ascendance to a leadership role. The permanent marks left by the [[tattoo]] artists would forever celebrate their endurance and dedication to cultural traditions. The pain was extreme and the risk of death by infection was a concern; to back down from tattooing was to risk being labeled a \"pala'ai\" or coward. Those who could not endure the pain and abandoned their tattooing were left incomplete, would be forced to wear their mark of shame throughout their life. This would forever bring shame upon their family so it was avoided at all cost. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nThe Samoan tattooing process used a number of tools which remained almost unchanged since their first use. \"Autapulu\" is a wide tattooing comb used to fill in the large dark areas of the tattoo. \"Ausogi'aso tele\" is a comb used for making thick lines. \"Ausogi'aso laititi\" is a comb used for making thin lines. \"Aumogo\" small comb is used for making small marks. \"Sausau\" is the mallet is used for striking the combs. It is almost two feet in length and made from the central rib of a coconut palm leaf. \"Tuluma\" is the pot used for holding the tattooing combs. Ipulama is the cup used for holding the dye. The dye is made from the soot collected from burnt lama nuts. \"Tu'I\"  used to grind up the dye. These tools were primarily made out of animal bones to ensure sharpness.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nThe tattooing process itself would be 5 sessions, in theory. These 5 sessions would be spread out over 10 days in order for the inflammation to subside.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nChristian missionaries from the west attempted to purge tattooing among the Samoans, thinking it barbaric and inhumane. Many young Samoans resisted mission schools since they forbade them to wear tattoos. But over time attitudes relaxed toward this cultural tradition and tattooing began to reemerge in Samoan culture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n[[File:Scythian tatoo.jpg|thumb|upright|A tattoo on the right arm of a [[Scythian]] chieftain whose mummy was discovered at [[Ukok Plateau|Pazyryk]], [[Russia]].

However, many of the descriptions of the individual described in the seamen's protection certificates were so general, and it was so easy to abuse the system, that many impressment officers of the [[Royal Navy]] simply paid no attention to them. \"In applying for a duplicate Seaman's Protection Certificate in 1817, James Francis stated that he 'had a protection granted him by the Collector of this Port on or about 12 March 1806 which was torn up and destroyed by a British Captain when at sea.'\"<ref>[https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1992/spring/seamans-protection.html \"Genealogical Fallout from the War of 1812.\"] By Ruth Priest Dixon. Prologue Magazine. Spring 1992. Volume 24 (1).</ref>\n\nOne way of making them more specific and more effective was to describe a tattoo, which is highly personal as to subject and location, and thus use that description to precisely identify the seaman. As a result, many of the official certificates also carried information about tattoos and scars, as well as any other specific identifying information. This also perhaps led to an increase and proliferation of tattoos among American seamen who wanted to avoid impressment. During this period, tattoos were not popular with the rest of the country. \"Frequently the \"protection papers\" made reference to tattoos, clear evidence that individual was a seafaring man; rarely did members of the general public adorn themselves with tattoos.\"<ref>Smith, Gene Allan. 2013. The Slave's Gamble. MacMillan. Page 55.</ref>\n\n\"In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, [[tattoo]]s were as much about self-expression as they were about having a unique way to identify a sailor's body should he be lost at sea or impressed by the British navy. The best source for early American tattoos is the [[protection papers]] issued following a 1796 congressional act to safeguard American seamen from impressment.
