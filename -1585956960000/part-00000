It was released as the [[lead single]] a week before the album's release. The song was later released in 2005 on Eminem's [[greatest hits]] album ''[[Curtain Call: The Hits]]''.\n\n\"The Real Slim Shady\" was Eminem's first song to reach number one in the [[United Kingdom]] and it also peaked at number four on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], giving him his biggest hit up to that point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1210|title=The Real Slim Shady}}</ref> The song was the 14th best selling of 2000 in the United Kingdom. It won multiple awards, including [[MTV Video Music Awards]] for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year|Best Video]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video|Best Male Video]], as well as a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Rap Solo Performance]].  In October 2011, ''[[NME]]'' placed it at number 80 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/list/150-best-tracks-of-the-past-15-years/248648/page/8|title=150 Best Tracks Of The Past 15 Years|work=NME.COM|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref> It was listed at number 396 on ''NME''{{'}}s 500 greatest songs of all time.\n\n==Premise==\n{{original research|section|date=June 2015}}\n\"The Real Slim Shady\" was not originally intended to be part of ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]''. [[Interscope Records]]'s [[Jimmy Iovine]] wanted Eminem to have a song to introduce the album, similar to the way \"[[My Name Is]]\" was the first single on ''[[The Slim Shady LP]].'' Eminem, [[Dr. Dre]], [[Tommy Coster]] and [[Mike Elizondo]] wrote \"The Real Slim Shady\" just hours before the final copy of the album was due. The first single was intended to be \"Who Knew.\"<ref>''[[VH1]]'s Ultimate Albums: The Marshall Mathers LP''</ref>\n\nThe song is a critique of [[manufactured pop]] songs that were popular at the time. It was a hit single, becoming Eminem's first chart topper in some countries, and garnering much attention for insulting various celebrities, including:\n* Actress [[Pamela Anderson]]'s alleged abuse at the hands of her ex-husband, rocker [[Tommy Lee]] (''Jaws all on the floor, like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door, and started whooping her *** worse than before, they first were divorced, throwing her over furniture'')\n* Eminem claims in one line to have murdered [[Dr. Dre]], and that he's locked him in his basement. This was a spin on one of his previous songs, \"[[My Name Is]]\", where Eminem says, \"And Dr. Dre said...\" then Dre comes on and says, \"Slim Shady, you're a basehead.\" (''And Dr. Dre said\u2014nothing, you idiots/Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement.'')\n* Comedian [[Tom Green]]'s [[bestiality|humping]] of a deceased [[moose]] on TV, and his song \"[[Lonely Swedish (The Bum Bum Song)|Lonely Swedish]]\". (''Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't/but it's cool for Tom Green to **** a dead moose.'')\n* Rapper [[Will Smith]]'s brand of commercialized and clean rap music and his [[MTV Video Music Awards|VMA]] acceptance speech where he boasted that he didn't need to curse or **** anybody on his records (''Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records/well, I do. So **** him, and **** you too.'') Eminem first dissed Smith in the music video in [[Dr. Dre]]'s \"[[Forgot About Dre]]\" when a news reporter asked him questions about the fire he and Dre started and he responded, \"Well I was just upstairs listening to my Will Smith CD\" in replacement to the middle of Eminem's verse due to the explicit lyrics.\n* Eminem mentions [[Britney Spears]] (''You think I give a **** about a Grammy?/Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me/\"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?\"/Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?/So you can sit me here, next to Britney Spears?'')\n* [[Christina Aguilera]] was angered by his claim that she performed [[oral sex]] on [[Fred Durst]] of the band [[Limp Bizkit]] and on [[Carson Daly]], an [[MTV]] [[VJ (media personality)|VJ]]. (''***, Christina Aguilera, better switch me chairs/so I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst/and hear 'em argue over who she [[fellatio|gave head]] to first.'')<ref name=\"people\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20278448,00.html |title=Eminem and His Many Feuds |magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]] |date=May 12, 2009 |last=Helling |first=Steve |accessdate=December 31, 2010}}</ref>\n* He also makes fun of the boy band [[NSYNC]] when he appears to dance in the video with the \"group\". (''I'm sick of you, little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me/so I have been sent here to destroy you.''). However, [[Chris Kirkpatrick]] was unhappy with this, so he called Eminem a \"bully\",<ref>https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/bridesmaid-toast-eminem-slim-shady/</ref> and Eminem attacked him with the song \"[[Without Me (Eminem song)|Without Me]]\".<ref>https://idobi.com/news/eminem-explains-his-disses-of-moby-chris-kirkpatrick-in-without-me/</ref>\n* He references the [[Bloodhound Gang]]'s song \"[[The Bad Touch]]\" (''They\u2019ve got the [[Discovery Channel]], don\u2019t they/We ain\u2019t nothing but mammals).\n\nThe chorus is about the sudden fashion changes caused by Eminem's success: \"I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady/All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating/So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up, please stand up, please stand up?\" The chorus imitates the [[catchphrase]] of the quiz show ''[[To Tell the Truth]]:'' \"Will the real ______ please stand up?\" In an interview <ref>{{Citation|last=Sirya ayriS|title=EMINEM speak about Curtain  Call  album 2005 on mtv Italy.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYQjEPVgOf4|access-date=2019-01-25}}</ref> while promoting his greatest hits album, ''Curtain Call,'' Eminem remarked that the sound of the chorus was intended to recreate that of a chainsaw going off. The sudden jump and increase in tempo as well as pitch recreates the motor of a chainsaw coming to life.\n\n==Critical reception==\nPopMatters described this song: \"In a number of songs on the new album, including the current single, 'The Real Slim Shady,' Eminem slams his 'enemies' with comic book intensity. In the video, he wears a superhero costume and an insane asylum straitjacket while rapping, 'I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me / So I have been sent here to destroy you / And there's a million of us just like me / Who cuss like me; who just don't give a **** like me / Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me / And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me!' Of course, the irony is built into the song: Eminem's signature style the bleached blond hair, pale skin, humungous T-shirt has spawned droves of lookalikes and wannabes. Voila, he's a teen idol. Poor Em, can't win for losing.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/e/eminem-marshall.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422004338/http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/e/eminem-marshall.shtml|title=Eminem: The Marshall Mathers LP - PopMatters Music Review|archivedate=22 April 2006|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref> Allmusic highlighted the single.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-marshall-mathers-lp-mw0000062949|title=The Marshall Mathers LP - Eminem - Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards - AllMusic|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|work=AllMusic|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref> Will Hermes was positive: \"In the aftermath of Slim Shady, he married the girlfriend he imagined killing, while his mother, immortalized in his hit single 'My Name Is' (''I just found out my Mom does more dope than I do''), sued him for $10 million for defamation of character.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,276305,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | title=News Review: The Marshall Mathers LP | date=June 2, 2000}}</ref>  The defamation case was settled in 2001 for $25,000, with Debbie Mathers' former attorney being awarded $23,354\u2014netting Ms. Mathers just over $1600 for her efforts.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1444814/judge-decides-against-eminems-mother-in-defamation-suit/ | work=MTV News | title=Judge Decides Against Eminem\u2019s Mother In Defamation Suit | date=2001-06-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1446458/eminems-mom-nets-measly-1600-from-lawsuits-against-her-son/ | work=MTV News | title=Eminem\u2019s Mom Nets Measly $1,600 From Lawsuits Against Her Son | date=2001-08-08}}</ref> LA Times wrote: \"'The Real Slim Shady,' the first single from the album, is a modest step to the mainstream\u2014a fresh and funny, almost PG-rated swipe at everything from the Grammy Awards to shallow teen pop.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/20/entertainment/ca-31967 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Robert | last=Hilburn | title=Eminem's Latest Seems Sure to Delight Fans, Anger Parents | date=May 20, 2000}}</ref>\n\nIGN cited: \"The album's obligatory 'pop' number is exposed on 'The Real Slim Shady,' which chugs and lurches along to a boinging electro funk beat.

It has been one of his most well-known songs.\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]] features Eminem performing the song in a psychiatric ward, a local Detroit neighborhood nearside a park, a fast-food joint, the Grammy Awards, and even in a factory where multiple clones of the rapper are produced. The video also features cameo appearances by [[Dr. Dre]], [[D12]], [[Fred Durst]], [[Kathy Griffin]], a lookalike of [[Kid Rock]], a lookalike of [[Carson Daly]], lookalikes of [[Pamela Anderson]] and [[Tommy Lee]], and even a stuffed [[Bill the Cat]] doll can also be seen being held in possession by one of the mental patients in the hospital scenes.\n\nActress and comedian [[Kathy Griffin]], who is also known for insulting celebrities in her act,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfist.com/archives/2006/07/24/kathy_griffin_dishing_and_swishing.php|title=Kathy Griffin: Dishing and Swishing|work=SFist|accessdate=25 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104192430/http://www.sfist.com/archives/2006/07/24/kathy_griffin_dishing_and_swishing.php|archivedate=4 November 2006}}</ref> appears in the video as an attending nurse in a psychiatric ward. Griffin said during a July 21, 2005, interview on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' that Eminem selected her for the video because fellow rapper [[Snoop Dogg]] told him she was \"really funny.\"<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjDUQ1sY--o|title=YouTube|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe video also features Eminem dressed in the same superhero costume used by [[Tom Green]] in the \"[[Lonely Swedish]]\" video chasing [[*NSYNC]] lookalikes, taking [[Justin Timberlake]] down to the ground and putting 'his bum on the man's lips.'<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/1424805/nsync-aguilera-weigh-in-on-eminem-track/ Nsync Weigh In on Eminem Track]</ref> The costume can be seen later in the \"[[Without Me (Eminem song)|Without Me]]\" music video following the release of ''[[The Eminem Show]]''.\n\nThe video features scenes corresponding to specific lyrics:\n\n*Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee chase each other around a couch and Anderson screaming in front of the camera. (''Like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door, and started whooping her *** worse than before, they first were divorced, throwing her over furniture.'')\n*An obese man in underwear being enslaved by a [[dominatrix]] with a paddle. (''Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose, but no worse than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms.'')\n*Two young boys watch the [[Discovery Channel]] on television with two [[rhinoceros]]es mating, then looking at each other in awe, referring to the 1999 song \"[[The Bad Touch]]\", by [[Bloodhound Gang]]. (''Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is by the time they hit fourth grade/They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?/\"We ain't nothing but mammals..\" Well, some of us cannibals'')\n*A [[gay marriage]] is shown and Eminem breaks up the two men about to kiss each other and showing disgust. (''But if we can **** dead animals and antelopes/then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope'')\n*after saying the verse 1 Eminem performs in a private room with all his clones with platinum blonde hair, rapper jeans and white T-shirt produced from the factory with their arms crossed their heads bobbing to the music standing still in an underground subway on the face of the imitator of him. (the chorus: 'Cause I'm Slim Shady, Yes, I'm The Real Shady/All You Others Slim Shadys Are Just Imitating/So Won't The Real Slim Shady Please Stand Up?/Please Stand Up?/Please Stand Up?)\n**Within this screenshot you can see Eminem rapping in a pink coloured room full of men who look like the artist I believe that this is effective as it creates a clear image of the artist which will leave a lasting impression on the audience and make the artist recognisable to the audience.This is effective as this makes the location of this scene look like they are in an underground subway by the lights and the different pictures which are located around the walls and on the ceiling which creates a messy image for the artist.\n*It could also be a reference to how he got lost in the huge sea of his fans; at that time, he was popular so much, that teenagers dressed like him (white T-shirts and blue jeans) and dyed their hair blonde. The reference could be noticed in the video of this song where his fans with blonde hair and white T-shirts were standing behind him.\n*Eminem at the Grammy Awards dressed as [[Britney Spears]], along with [[Fred Durst]] and [[Carson Daly]] pulling a blow-up doll of Christina Aguilera between their seats towards each other angrily until it flies out of the chair. (''Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs so I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst, ang hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first.'')\n*In a factory you see white men transformed into Eminem clones, with platinum blonde hair, rapper jeans and white T-shirt.( And There's A Million Of Us Just Like Me Who Cuss Like Me, Who Just Don't Give A **** Like Me Who Dress Like Me, Walk, Talk And Act Like Me And Just Might Be The Next Best Thing, But Not Quite Me) \n*In the video for the song, a factory can be seen turning young white men into clones of Eminem, with hair dyed platinum blonde, baggy jeans and a plain white T-shirt.\n*A clip from a cartoon of a frog tap-dancing on a turtle (from the ''[[Flip the Frog]]'' film ''[[Fiddlesticks (film)|Fiddlesticks]]'') can be seen on a TV in the hospital and the viewer laughs at it.\n*Eminem works in a fictional fast-food restaurant with an 'Ask Me' patch giving a woman her order and rejecting it because of the onion rings being forgotten, however he gets the onion rings and he spits in them as a form of revenge for her rude treatment of him, and gives the onion rings to the woman to complete her order, which she begins eating as she walks away. The same scene also shows Eminem driving recklessly around in circles in a parking lot in a blue [[AMC Pacer]]. (''He could be working at Burger King, spitting on your onion rings/or in the parking lot, circling, screaming: \"I don't give a ****!\"/With his windows down and his system up'')\n*after saying the verse 3 Eminem performs in a private room with all his clones with platinum blonde hair, rapper jeans and white T-shirt produced from the factory with their arms crossed their heads bobbing to the music standing still in an underground subway watching the exit. (the chorus: 'Cause I'm Slim Shady, Yes, I'm The Real Shady/All You Others Slim Shadys Are Just Imitating/So Won't The Real Slim Shady Please Stand Up?/Please Stand Up?/Please Stand Up?)\n\nIn the uncensored version of the music video, the fat man in underwear wears a [[gag (BDSM)#Ball|ball gag]]; in the censored version, he does not. The edited version also does not show Eminem raises his middle fingers; instead, he points at the camera.\n\n==Credits==\nInformation from the interior booklet of The Marshall Mathers LP\n\nSinging And Lyrics : [[Eminem]]\nProduction : Dr. Dre And Mel-Man\nMixing : Dr. Dre\nBass, Guitar \u2013 Mike Elizondo\nKeyboards \u2013 [[Tommy Coster Jr.]]\nDirectors : [[Philip G.

It was released as the [[lead single]] a week before the album's release. The song was later released in 2005 on Eminem's [[greatest hits]] album ''[[Curtain Call: The Hits]]''.\n\n\"The Real Slim Shady\" was Eminem's first song to reach number one in the [[United Kingdom]] and it also peaked at number four on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], giving him his biggest hit up to that point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1210|title=The Real Slim Shady}}</ref> The song was the 14th best selling of 2000 in the United Kingdom. It won multiple awards, including [[MTV Video Music Awards]] for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year|Best Video]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video|Best Male Video]], as well as a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Rap Solo Performance]].  In October 2011, ''[[NME]]'' placed it at number 80 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/list/150-best-tracks-of-the-past-15-years/248648/page/8|title=150 Best Tracks Of The Past 15 Years|work=NME.COM|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref> It was listed at number 396 on ''NME''{{'}}s 500 greatest songs of all time.\n\n==Premise==\n{{original research|section|date=June 2015}}\n\"The Real Slim Shady\" was not originally intended to be part of ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]''. [[Interscope Records]]'s [[Jimmy Iovine]] wanted Eminem to have a song to introduce the album, similar to the way \"[[My Name Is]]\" was the first single on ''[[The Slim Shady LP]].'' Eminem, [[Dr. Dre]], [[Tommy Coster]] and [[Mike Elizondo]] wrote \"The Real Slim Shady\" just hours before the final copy of the album was due. The first single was intended to be \"Who Knew.\"<ref>''[[VH1]]'s Ultimate Albums: The Marshall Mathers LP''</ref>\n\nThe song is a critique of [[manufactured pop]] songs that were popular at the time. It was a hit single, becoming Eminem's first chart topper in some countries, and garnering much attention for insulting various celebrities, including:\n* Actress [[Pamela Anderson]]'s alleged abuse at the hands of her ex-husband, rocker [[Tommy Lee]] (''Jaws all on the floor, like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door, and started whooping her *** worse than before, they first were divorced, throwing her over furniture'')\n* Eminem claims in one line to have murdered [[Dr. Dre]], and that he's locked him in his basement. This was a spin on one of his previous songs, \"[[My Name Is]]\", where Eminem says, \"And Dr. Dre said...\" then Dre comes on and says, \"Slim Shady, you're a basehead.\" (''And Dr. Dre said\u2014nothing, you idiots/Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement.'')\n* Comedian [[Tom Green]]'s [[bestiality|humping]] of a deceased [[moose]] on TV, and his song \"[[Lonely Swedish (The Bum Bum Song)|Lonely Swedish]]\". (''Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't/but it's cool for Tom Green to **** a dead moose.'')\n* Rapper [[Will Smith]]'s brand of commercialized and clean rap music and his [[MTV Video Music Awards|VMA]] acceptance speech where he boasted that he didn't need to curse or **** anybody on his records (''Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records/well, I do. So **** him, and **** you too.'') Eminem first dissed Smith in the music video in [[Dr. Dre]]'s \"[[Forgot About Dre]]\" when a news reporter asked him questions about the fire he and Dre started and he responded, \"Well I was just upstairs listening to my Will Smith CD\" in replacement to the middle of Eminem's verse due to the explicit lyrics.\n* Eminem mentions [[Britney Spears]] (''You think I give a **** about a Grammy?/Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me/\"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?\"/Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?/So you can sit me here, next to Britney Spears?'')\n* [[Christina Aguilera]] was angered by his claim that she performed [[oral sex]] on [[Fred Durst]] of the band [[Limp Bizkit]] and on [[Carson Daly]], an [[MTV]] [[VJ (media personality)|VJ]]. (''***, Christina Aguilera, better switch me chairs/so I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst/and hear 'em argue over who she [[fellatio|gave head]] to first.'')<ref name=\"people\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20278448,00.html |title=Eminem and His Many Feuds |magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]] |date=May 12, 2009 |last=Helling |first=Steve |accessdate=December 31, 2010}}</ref>\n* He also makes fun of the boy band [[NSYNC]] when he appears to dance in the video with the \"group\". (''I'm sick of you, little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me/so I have been sent here to destroy you.''). However, [[Chris Kirkpatrick]] was unhappy with this, so he called Eminem a \"bully\",<ref>https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/bridesmaid-toast-eminem-slim-shady/</ref> and Eminem attacked him with the song \"[[Without Me (Eminem song)|Without Me]]\".<ref>https://idobi.com/news/eminem-explains-his-disses-of-moby-chris-kirkpatrick-in-without-me/</ref>\n* He references the [[Bloodhound Gang]]'s song \"[[The Bad Touch]]\" (''They\u2019ve got the [[Discovery Channel]], don\u2019t they/We ain\u2019t nothin but mammals).\n\nThe chorus is about the sudden fashion changes caused by Eminem's success: \"I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady/All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating/So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up, please stand up, please stand up?\" The chorus imitates the [[catchphrase]] of the quiz show ''[[To Tell the Truth]]:'' \"Will the real ______ please stand up?\" In an interview <ref>{{Citation|last=Sirya ayriS|title=EMINEM speak about Curtain  Call  album 2005 on mtv Italy.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYQjEPVgOf4|access-date=2019-01-25}}</ref> while promoting his greatest hits album, ''Curtain Call,'' Eminem remarked that the sound of the chorus was intended to recreate that of a chainsaw going off. The sudden jump and increase in tempo as well as pitch recreates the motor of a chainsaw coming to life.\n\n==Critical reception==\nPopMatters described this song: \"In a number of songs on the new album, including the current single, 'The Real Slim Shady,' Eminem slams his 'enemies' with comic book intensity. In the video, he wears a superhero costume and an insane asylum straitjacket while rapping, 'I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me / So I have been sent here to destroy you / And there's a million of us just like me / Who cuss like me; who just don't give a **** like me / Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me / And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me!' Of course, the irony is built into the song: Eminem's signature style the bleached blond hair, pale skin, humungous T-shirt has spawned droves of lookalikes and wannabes. Voila, he's a teen idol. Poor Em, can't win for losing.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/e/eminem-marshall.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422004338/http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/e/eminem-marshall.shtml|title=Eminem: The Marshall Mathers LP - PopMatters Music Review|archivedate=22 April 2006|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref> Allmusic highlighted the single.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-marshall-mathers-lp-mw0000062949|title=The Marshall Mathers LP - Eminem - Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards - AllMusic|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|work=AllMusic|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref> Will Hermes was positive: \"In the aftermath of Slim Shady, he married the girlfriend he imagined killing, while his mother, immortalized in his hit single 'My Name Is' (''I just found out my Mom does more dope than I do''), sued him for $10 million for defamation of character.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,276305,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | title=News Review: The Marshall Mathers LP | date=June 2, 2000}}</ref>  The defamation case was settled in 2001 for $25,000, with Debbie Mathers' former attorney being awarded $23,354\u2014netting Ms. Mathers just over $1600 for her efforts.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1444814/judge-decides-against-eminems-mother-in-defamation-suit/ | work=MTV News | title=Judge Decides Against Eminem\u2019s Mother In Defamation Suit | date=2001-06-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1446458/eminems-mom-nets-measly-1600-from-lawsuits-against-her-son/ | work=MTV News | title=Eminem\u2019s Mom Nets Measly $1,600 From Lawsuits Against Her Son | date=2001-08-08}}</ref> LA Times wrote: \"'The Real Slim Shady,' the first single from the album, is a modest step to the mainstream\u2014a fresh and funny, almost PG-rated swipe at everything from the Grammy Awards to shallow teen pop.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/20/entertainment/ca-31967 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Robert | last=Hilburn | title=Eminem's Latest Seems Sure to Delight Fans, Anger Parents | date=May 20, 2000}}</ref>\n\nIGN cited: \"The album's obligatory 'pop' number is exposed on 'The Real Slim Shady,' which chugs and lurches along to a boinging electro funk beat.

(''Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is by the time they hit fourth grade/They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?/\"We ain't nothing but mammals..\" Well, some of us cannibals'')\n*Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee chasing each other around a couch and Anderson screaming in front of the camera.

The same scene also shows Eminem driving recklessly around in circles in a parking lot in a blue [[AMC Pacer]]. (''He could be working at Burger King, spitting on your onion rings/or in the parking lot, circling, screaming: \"I don't give a ****!\"/With his windows down and his system up'')\n\nIn the uncensored version of the music video, the fat man in underwear wears a [[gag (BDSM)#Ball|ball gag]]; in the censored version, he does not.

These can be used for filling regions of the screen and portraying [[drop shadow]]s.\n\n==Encodings==\n===Unicode===\n[[Unicode]] includes 128 such characters.<ref name=\"Unicode_BoxDrawing\"/> In many Unicode fonts only the subset that is also available in the [[IBM PC compatible|IBM PC]] character set (see below) will exist, due to it being defined as part of the [[WGL4]] character set.\n\n[[Image:Unicode Box Drawings (2500 - 27FF).svg|270px|thumb|right|'''Unicode box-drawing symbols'''.

Dal\u00ed refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again.

The 14 oil paintings and other works in the exhibition reflected Dal\u00ed's increasing interest in atomic physics. Notable works included ''Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom)'', ''Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather'', and a study for ''[[Leda Atomica]]''. The proportions of the latter work were worked out in collaboration with a mathematician.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 440-42</ref>\n\nIn early 1948 Dal\u00ed's ''50 Secrets of Magic Craftsmanship'' was published.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was charged with assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting.

In 1931 he became involved in the [[Workers and Peasants' Bloc|Wokers' and Peasants' Front]], delivering lectures at meetings and contributing to their party journal.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 287-89</ref> However, as political divisions within the Surrealist movement grew, Dal\u00ed soon developed a more apolitical stance, refusing to publicly denounce fascism. In 1934 Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler, and Dal\u00ed narrowly avoided being expelled from the movement.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 320-25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Dal\u00ed avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939 Dal\u00ed praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist movement.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter Dal\u00ed's return to his native Catalonia in 1948 he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 448, 465-66</ref> Dal\u00ed was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959. He had official meetings with General Franco in June 1956, October 1968 and May 1974.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 486, 543, 553</ref> In 1968 Dal\u00ed stated that on Franco's death there should be no return to democracy and Spain should become an absolute monarchy,<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 525-27</ref> In September 1975 Dal\u00ed publicly supported Franco's decision to execute three alleged Basque terrorists and repeated his support for an absolute monarchy, adding: \"Personally, I'm against freedom; I'm for the Holy Inquisition.\"  In the following days he fled to New York after his home in Port Lligat was stoned and he had received numerous death threats.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 560-62</ref> When King Juan Carlos visited the ailing Dal\u00ed in August 1981, the painter told him: \"I have always been an anarchist and a monarchist.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 587</ref>\n\nDal\u00ed espoused a mystical view of Catholicism and In his later years he claimed to be a Catholic and an agnostic.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Descharnes, Gilles N\u00e9ret|url=https://archive.org/details/salvadordali190400robe/page/166|title=Salvador Dal\u00ed, 1904-1989|publisher=Benedikt Taschen|year=1994|isbn=978-3-8228-0298-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/salvadordali190400robe/page/166 166]|quote=Dal\u00ed, dualist as ever in his approach, was now claiming to be both an agnostic and a Roman Catholic.}}</ref>  He was interested in the writings of the Jesuit priest and philosopher [[Teilhard de Chardin]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=McNeese|first=Tim|title=Salvador Dal\u00ed|publisher=Chelsea House|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7910-8837-1|location=|page=102}}</ref> and his [[Omega Point]] theory, Dal\u00ed's painting ''[[Tuna Fishing (painting)|Tuna Fishing (Homage to Meissonier)]]'' (1967) was inspired by his reading of Chardin.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 525</ref>\n\n=== Sexuality ===\nDal\u00ed's sexuality had a profound influence on his work. He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''The First Days of Spring'' (1929), ''The Great Masturbator'' (1929) and ''The Lugubrious Game'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career. In 1941 the Director of Exhibitions and Publications at MoMA wrote: \"The fame of Salvador Dal\u00ed has been an issue of particular controversy for more than a decade...Dal\u00ed's conduct may have been undignified, but the greater part of his art is a matter of dead earnest.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 413-14</ref> When Dal\u00ed was elected to the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts|French Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1979 one of his fellow academicians stated that he hoped Dal\u00ed would now abandon his \"clowneries\".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 569</ref>\n\nIn 1936, at the premiere screening of [[Joseph Cornell]]'s film ''[[Rose Hobart (film)|Rose Hobart]]'' at Julien Levy's gallery in New York City, Dal\u00ed knocked over the projector in a rage and is said to have shouted:  \"He stole it [the film] from my subconscious!

Don Salvador Dal\u00ed y Cusi strongly disapproved of his son's romance with Gala, and saw his connection to the Surrealists as a bad influence on his morals.

Dal\u00ed refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again. The following summer, Dal\u00ed and Gala rented a small fisherman's cabin in a nearby bay at [[Port Lligat]].

Dal\u00ed continued to paint her as they both aged, producing sympathetic and adoring images of her.

Notable works included ''Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom)'', ''Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather'', and a study for ''[[Leda Atomica]]''.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was charged with assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting.

In 1934 Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler, and Dal\u00ed narrowly avoided being expelled from the movement.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 320-25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Dal\u00ed avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939 Dal\u00ed praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist movement.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter Dal\u00ed's return to his native Catalonia in 1948 he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 448, 465-66</ref> Dal\u00ed was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''The First Days of Spring'' (1929), ''The Great Masturbator'' (1929) and ''The Lugubrious Game'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career.

In 2019, he wrote a short book, initially in Japanese and later translated to English, ''Confessions Of A Climate Scientist: The Global Warming Hypothesis Is An Unproven Hypothesis''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mototaka|first=Nakamura|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=9ZVOzQEACAAJ&dq=mototaka+nakamura&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiQnO7SpLHoAhULXpoKHe47DkwQ6AEISDAE|title=Confessions of a Climate Scientist The Global Warming Hypothesis is an Unproven Hypothesis|date=2019|language=en}}</ref> \n==Personal and professional history==\n\nNakamura became concerned with climate change in high school, because of \"odd weather patterns\" possibly due to \"deep-circulation changes in the oceans.\u201d Before attending college, Nakamura worked for a company in Japan. He left Japan to obtain his BS in meteorology with minor in oceanography from North Carolina State University in 1989.\n\nAt [[MIT]] for his Ph.D work, Nakamura used conceptualized models to show existence of complex stabilizing and destabilizing feedbacks among atmospheric transports of moisture and heat, thermohaline circulation, ice-albedo effects, and river runoff processes, and how they are masked by flux adjustments in coupled Global Climate Models. His work on non-linear behaviors of Rossby waves helped \"explain characteristics of material mixing in the upper troposphere and stratosphere and issues relating to the ozone hole problem.\u201d Nakamura completed his Ph.D in 1994 and stayed another year at MIT.\n\nSubsequently, Nakamura had a series of short-term jobs at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Goddard Space Flight, and MIT, followed by three years at CalTech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \n\nNakamura next worked as a professional jazz musician for almost 2 years, when chronic thumb pain made him return to work in science. After working at Duke University, he went to Frontier Research Center for Global Change, where he researched atmospheric and oceanic topics from improvement of a convective mixing scheme to examination of eddy\u2013mean relationships' role in large-scale ocean circulation.\n\nIn Fall 2005, Nakamura joined IPRC as visiting associate researcher from Frontier Research Center for Global Change. At IPRC he investigated alternating zonal jets and worked on mid-latitude atmosphere and ocean dynamics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610030843/http://iprc.soest.hawaii.edu/newsletters/newsletter_sections/iprc_climate_vol5_2/news_and_new_staff.pdf|title=IPRC News, New IPRC Staff, Mototaka Nakamura|last=|first=|date=2010-06-10|website=web.archive.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030055528/https://iprc.soest.hawaii.edu/people/nakamura.php|title=International Pacific Research Center {{!}} People {{!}} Mototaka Nakamura|date=2014-10-30|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2008, Nakamura chaired a session at the IPRC Annual Symposium on Accomplishments of the APDRC.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191101215833/http://iprc.soest.hawaii.edu/meetings/workshops/08_05_IPRCAnnualSympsiumAgenda.pdf|title=IPRC Annual Symposium Agenda|last=|first=|date=May 2008|website=web.archive.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> In November 2008, Nakamura hosted his former advisor, Professor R.

In 2019, he wrote a short book, initially in Japanese and later translated to English, ''Confessions Of A Climate Scientist: The Global Warming Hypothesis Is An Unproven Hypothesis''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mototaka|first=Nakamura|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=9ZVOzQEACAAJ&dq=mototaka+nakamura&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiQnO7SpLHoAhULXpoKHe47DkwQ6AEISDAE|title=Confessions of a Climate Scientist The Global Warming Hypothesis is an Unproven Hypothesis|date=2019|language=en}}</ref> \n==Personal and professional history==\n\nNakamura became concerned with climate change in high school, because of \"odd weather patterns\" possibly due to \"deep-circulation changes in the oceans.\u201d Before attending college, Nakamura worked for a company in Japan. He left Japan to obtain his BS in meteorology with minor in oceanography from North Carolina State University in 1989.\n\nAt [[MIT]] for his Ph.D work, Nakamura used conceptualized models to show existence of complex stabilizing and destabilizing feedbacks among atmospheric transports of moisture and heat, thermohaline circulation, ice-albedo effects, and river runoff processes, and how they are masked by flux adjustments in coupled Global Climate Models. His work on non-linear behaviors of Rossby waves helped \"explain characteristics of material mixing in the upper troposphere and stratosphere and issues relating to the ozone hole problem.\u201d Nakamura completed his Ph.D in 1994 and stayed another year at MIT.\n\nSubsequently, Nakamura had a series of short-term jobs at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Goddard Space Flight, and MIT, followed by three years at CalTech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \n\nNakamura next worked as a professional jazz musician for almost 2 years, when chronic thumb pain made him return to work in science. After working at Duke University, he went to Frontier Research Center for Global Change, where he researched atmospheric and oceanic topics from improvement of a convective mixing scheme to examination of eddy\u2013mean relationships' role in large-scale ocean circulation.\n\nIn Fall 2005, Nakamura joined IPRC as visiting associate researcher from Frontier Research Center for Global Change. At IPRC he investigated alternating zonal jets and worked on mid-latitude atmosphere and ocean dynamics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610030843/http://iprc.soest.hawaii.edu/newsletters/newsletter_sections/iprc_climate_vol5_2/news_and_new_staff.pdf|title=IPRC News, New IPRC Staff, Mototaka Nakamura|last=|first=|date=2010-06-10|website=web.archive.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030055528/https://iprc.soest.hawaii.edu/people/nakamura.php|title=International Pacific Research Center {{!}} People {{!}} Mototaka Nakamura|date=2014-10-30|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2008, Nakamura chaired a session at the IPRC Annual Symposium on Accomplishments of the APDRC.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191101215833/http://iprc.soest.hawaii.edu/meetings/workshops/08_05_IPRCAnnualSympsiumAgenda.pdf|title=IPRC Annual Symposium Agenda|last=|first=|date=May 2008|website=web.archive.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> In November 2008, Nakamura hosted his former advisor, Professor R.
