After his death, the Vietnamese attached many legends to him{{sfnp|Keown|2003|p=326}} and honoured him as '''King S\u0129''' (Vietnamese: '''S\u0129 V\u01b0\u01a1ng''') in some temples.\n\n==Family background and early life==\nShi Xie was born in Guangxin Commandery (\u5ee3\u4fe1\u90e1), [[Jiao Province]], which is in present-day [[Cangwu County]], [[Guangxi]], but his [[Ancestral home (Chinese)|ancestral home]] was around present-day [[Tai'an]], [[Shandong]]. His ancestors moved to Jiao Province when [[Wang Mang]] usurped the throne and established the [[Xin dynasty]] (9\u201323) with himself as its emperor. Shi Xie's father, Shi Ci (\u58eb\u8cdc), served as the Administrator of Rinan Commandery (\u65e5\u5357\u90e1) during the reign of [[Emperor Huan of Han|Emperor Huan]] ({{reign|146|168}}) of the [[Eastern Han dynasty]]. The Shi family was one of the elite families of [[Han Chinese]] origin who later emigrated to present-day [[Vietnam]] and played a major role in developing Vietnamese civilisation.{{sfnp|Taylor|1983|p=70}}\n\nIn his youth, Shi Xie studied the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' under the tutelage of one Liu Tao (\u5289\u9676) from [[Yingchuan Commandery]] (\u6f41\u5ddd\u90e1). Later, he was nominated as a ''[[xiaolian]]'' (civil service candidate) and served in the Han central government as a Gentleman of Writing (\u5c1a\u66f8\u90ce) but was later dismissed because of \"official reasons\". After his father's death, he was nominated as a ''maocai'' (\u8302\u624d) and was appointed as the Prefect of Wu County (\u5deb\u7e23; present-day [[Wushan County, Chongqing]]). In 187, the Han central government reassigned him to be the Administrator (\u592a\u5b88) of Jiaozhi Commandery (\u4ea4\u8dbe\u90e1) in [[Jiao Province]].{{sfnp|Taylor|1983|p=70}}\n\n==As a warlord in Jiao Province==\n[[File:End of Han Dynasty Warlords.png|thumb|450px|Map showing the major warlords of the Han dynasty in the 190s, including Shi Xie]]\n\nAround the time, Zhu Fu (\u6731\u7b26) had been appointed by the Han government to serve as the Inspector of [[Jiao Province]]. However, the locals in Jiao Province rebelled and killed him after he attempted to extract heavier taxes from them. The Han government then sent Zhang Jin (\u5f35\u6d25) to replace him, but Zhang Jin was later murdered by his subordinate Ou Jing (\u5340\u666f). When [[Liu Biao]], the Governor of [[Jing Province]], heard about this, he appointed Lai Gong (\u8cf4\u606d) as the new Inspector of Jiao Province without authorisation from the Han central government. At the same time, he also sent his subordinate Wu Ju (\u5433\u5de8) to replace the deceased Shi Huang (\u53f2\u749c) as the Administrator of Cangwu Commandery (\u84bc\u68a7\u90e1). To counter Liu Biao's attempts to extend his influence into Jiao Province, the Han central government issued an imperial decree appointing Shi Xie as General of the Household Who Pacifies the South (\u7d8f\u5357\u4e2d\u90ce\u5c07) and putting him in charge of the seven commanderies in Jiao Province.\n\nAfter Shi Xie sent his subordinate Zhang Min (\u5f35\u65fb) to thank the Han central government and pay tribute, the Han central government further promoted him to General Who Stabilises Distant Lands (\u5b89\u9060\u5c07\u8ecd), in addition to enfeoffing him as the Marquis of Longdu Village (\u9f8d\u5ea6\u4ead\u4faf). Around the time, the Han Empire was in a state of chaos, as various warlords fought for power and territories in northern and central China. Jiao Province, being a remote province in southern China, was not caught up in the chaos. Shi Xie was effectively a warlord in control of Jiao Province even though he was still a nominal subject of the Han Empire. Shi Xie's younger brothers also held important positions in Jiao Province: Shi Yi (\u58eb\u58f9), Shi Hui (\u58eb\u4d4b) and Shi Wu (\u58eb\u6b66) were respectively the Administrators of Hepu (\u5408\u6d66), Jiuzhen (\u4e5d\u771f) and Nanhai (\u5357\u6d77) commanderies in Jiao Province.\n\nIn 210, Wu Ju got into conflict with Lai Gong and forced him out of Jiao Province. [[Sun Quan]], the warlord who controlled the territories in the [[Jiangnan|Jiangdong]] region bordering Jiao Province, appointed his subordinate [[Bu Zhi]] as the Inspector of Jiao Province to replace Lai Gong. Shi Xie led his followers to submit to Bu Zhi's governorship, but Wu Ju refused and secretly plotted to assassinate Bu Zhi. However, Bu Zhi sensed Wu Ju's intentions and managed to outwit and kill him. Sun Quan later appointed Shi Xie as General of the Left (\u5de6\u5c07\u8ecd) to honour him. At the same time, the warlord [[Cao Cao]], who controlled the Han central government, wanted to gain Shi Xie's support as an ally against Sun Quan, so he conferred the [[nine bestowments]] and other honours on Shi Xie in the name of [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] (the figurehead Han emperor under Cao Cao's control).\n\n==As a vassal of Eastern Wu==\nIn the years after the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty in 220, [[Sun Quan]] declared himself king and established the kingdom (later empire) of [[Eastern Wu]]. Shi Xie pledged loyalty to Sun Quan and sent one of his sons, Shi Xin (\u58eb\u5ede), as a hostage to Sun Quan to ensure his allegiance towards Wu. He also regularly sent tribute to Sun Quan.{{sfnp|Taylor|1983|p=70}} During the conflict between Wu and its ally-turned-rival state [[Shu Han]], Shi Xie sided with Wu and instigated Yong Kai (\u96cd\u95d3), a local tribal chief in Shu territory, to rebel against Shu rule and defect to Wu. In recognition of Shi Xie's efforts in inducing Yong Kai to defect, Sun Quan appointed Shi Xie as General of the Guards (\u885b\u5c07\u8ecd) and awarded him the title \"Marquis of Longbian\" (\u9f8d\u7de8\u4faf). Shi Xie died of illness in 226 around the age of 89.\n\n==Family==\n<center>\n;Shi Xie's family tree\n{{chart/start}}\n{{chart| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | ShiCi |ShiCi='''Shi Ci'''<br>\u58eb\u8cdc}}\n{{chart| | | | | | | | | |,|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|^|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| |}}\n{{chart| | | | | | | | | ShiXie | | | | | | | | | | | | | | ShiYi | | ShiHui1 | | ShiWu |ShiXie='''Shi Xie'''<br>\u58eb\u71ee<br>{{small|(137\u2013226)}}|ShiYi='''Shi Yi'''<br>\u58eb\u58f9|ShiHui1='''Shi Hui'''<br>\u58eb\u4d4b|ShiWu='''Shi Wu'''<br>\u58eb\u6b66}}\n{{chart| |,|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | | | | | |!| }}\n{{chart| ShiXin | | ShiZhi | | ShiHui2 | | ShiGan | | ShiSong | | | | | | ShiKuang |ShiXin='''Shi Xin'''<br>\u58eb\u5ede|ShiZhi='''Shi Zhi'''<br>\u58eb\u7957|ShiHui2='''Shi Hui'''<br>\u58eb\u5fbd<br>{{small|(165\u2013227)}}|ShiGan='''Shi Gan'''<br>\u58eb\u5e79|ShiSong='''Shi Song'''<br>\u58eb\u980c|ShiKuang='''Shi Kuang'''<br>\u58eb\u5321}}\n{{chart/end}}\n</center>\n\nShi Xie had at least five sons (in decreasing order of seniority): Shi Xin (\u58eb\u5ede), Shi Zhi (\u58eb\u7957), [[Shi Hui (Three Kingdoms)|Shi Hui]] (\u58eb\u5fbd), Shi Gan (\u58eb\u5e79) and Shi Song (\u58eb\u980c).\n\nAfter Shi Xie died in 226, his third son Shi Hui succeeded him as the Administrator of [[Jiaozhi|Jiaozhi Commandery]] (\u4ea4\u8dbe\u90e1) under the [[Eastern Wu]] regime. Around the time, the Wu emperor [[Sun Quan]] wanted to split [[Jiao Province]] and create another province, Guang Province (\u5ee3\u5dde): Jiaozhi, Jiuzhen (\u4e5d\u771f) and Rinan (\u65e5\u5357) commanderies would remain part of Jiao Province; Cangwu (\u84bc\u68a7), Nanhai (\u5357\u6d77), Yulin (\u9b31\u6797) and Hepu (\u5408\u6d66) commanderies would form the new Guang Province. Sun Quan then appointed Dai Liang (\u6234\u826f) and [[L\u00fc Dai]] as the Inspectors of Jiao and Guang provinces respectively. Chen Shi (\u9673\u6642), a close aide of Sun Quan, was to replace Shi Hui as the Administrator of Jiaozhi Commandery.\n\nIn 227, when Shi Hui learnt about the new arrangements, he refused to comply and rebelled against Wu rule by sending his troops to block Dai Liang and Chen Shi from entering Jiao Province. At the time, Huan Lin (\u6853\u9130), one of Shi Hui's subordinates, begged his superior to obey the order and surrender his governorship of Jiaozhi Commandery to Chen Shi. However, Shi Hui refused and had Huan Lin flogged to death. Huan Lin's nephew, Huan Fa (\u6853\u767c), started a mutiny against Shi Hui and engaged him in a battle that lasted a few months. They made peace after that.\n\nIn the meantime, after learning of Shi Hui's rebellion, Sun Quan ordered L\u00fc Dai, the Inspector of Guang Province, to lead troops to recapture Jiaozhi Commandery. L\u00fc Dai, who was close to Shi Hui's cousin Shi Kuang (\u58eb\u5321; a son of Shi Xie's brother Shi Yi \u58eb\u58f9), sent Shi Kuang to persuade Shi Hui to surrender by promising that he would be spared if he did so. Shi Hui and his brothers then opened the gates of Jiaozhi Commandery and surrendered to L\u00fc Dai. The following day, L\u00fc Dai lured the Shi brothers into a trap during a banquet, had them arrested and then read out a list of Shi Hui's crimes. He then executed all of them and sent their heads to Sun Quan, who was in Wuchang (\u6b66\u660c; present-day [[Ezhou]], [[Hubei]]) at the time.\n\nShi Xie's brothers, Shi Yi (\u58eb\u58f9) and Shi Hui (\u58eb\u4d4b), along with their families, were spared from death but reduced to the status of commoners. Some years later, Shi Yi and Shi Hui were executed for committing crimes.\n\nEarlier in the 220s, Shi Xie had sent his eldest son, Shi Xin (\u58eb\u5ede), as a hostage to Sun Quan to ensure the Wu emperor of his allegiance towards him. Shi Xin thus avoided ending up like Shi Hui and his other brothers, who were executed by L\u00fc Dai in 227. Like the rest of the Shi family who survived (e.g. his uncles Shi Yi and Shi Hui \u58eb\u4d4b), he was reduced to the status of a commoner after his brothers' deaths. He died of illness some time later and had no son to succeed him.\n\n==Worship of \"King S\u0129\", S\u0129 Ti\u1ebfp in Vietnam==\nSome Chinese heroes were deified in [[Name of Vietnam|Annam]] after the [[End of the Han dynasty|fall of the Han dynasty]] in 220. Among them was Shi Xie, who was deified in the sixth century. As one of the officials who ruled northern Annam in the 1st century, he was given the [[posthumous name]] ''Thi\u00ean C\u1ea3m Gia \u1ee8ng Linh V\u0169 \u0110\u1ea1i V\u01b0\u01a1ng'' ({{linktext|\u5584|\u611f|\u5609|\u61c9|\u9748|\u6b66|\u5927|\u738b}}) by an emperor of Vietnam's [[Tr\u1ea7n dynasty]], as recorded in the ''[[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t s\u1eed k\u00fd to\u00e0n th\u01b0]]'' ({{linktext|\u5927|\u8d8a|\u53f2|\u8a18|\u5168|\u66f8}}), and ''History of King Si'' ({{lang|vi|K\u1ef3 S\u0129 V\u01b0\u01a1ng}}).\n\nShi Xie is still honoured in some Vietnamese temples today as \"King Si\" ({{lang|vi|S\u0129 V\u01b0\u01a1ng}}).{{sfnp|Schafer|1967|p=99}} The Vietnamese history ''[[Vi\u1ec7t \u0110i\u1ec7n U Linh T\u1eadp]]'' ({{linktext|\u8d8a|\u7538|\u5e7d|\u9748|\u96c6}}; {{circa}} 1400) adds significantly to the traditions of the Chinese records with local Vietnamese traditions.{{sfnp|Dror|2007|p=15}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* [[Chen Shou|Chen, Shou]] (3rd century).

After his death, the Vietnamese attached many legends to him{{sfnp|Keown|2003|p=326}} and honoured him as '''King S\u0129''' (Vietnamese: '''S\u0129 V\u01b0\u01a1ng''') in some temples.\n\n==Family background and early life==\nShi Xie was born in Guangxin Commandery (\u5ee3\u4fe1\u90e1), [[Jiao Province]], which is in present-day [[Cangwu County]], [[Guangxi]], but his [[Ancestral home (Chinese)|ancestral home]] was around present-day [[Tai'an]], [[Shandong]]. His ancestors moved to Jiao Province when [[Wang Mang]] usurped the throne and established the [[Xin dynasty]] (9\u201323) with himself as its emperor. Shi Xie's father, Shi Ci (\u58eb\u8cdc), served as the Administrator of Rinan Commandery (\u65e5\u5357\u90e1) during the reign of [[Emperor Huan of Han|Emperor Huan]] ({{reign|146|168}}) of the [[Eastern Han dynasty]]. The Shi family was one of the elite families of [[Han Chinese]] origin who later emigrated to present-day [[Vietnam]] and played a major role in developing Vietnamese civilisation.{{sfnp|Taylor|1983|p=70}}\n\nIn his youth, Shi Xie studied the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' under the tutelage of one Liu Tao (\u5289\u9676) from [[Yingchuan Commandery]] (\u6f41\u5ddd\u90e1). Later, he was nominated as a ''[[xiaolian]]'' (civil service candidate) and served in the Han central government as a Gentleman of Writing (\u5c1a\u66f8\u90ce) but was later dismissed because of \"official reasons\". After his father's death, he was nominated as a ''maocai'' (\u8302\u624d) and was appointed as the Prefect of Wu County (\u5deb\u7e23; present-day [[Wushan County, Chongqing]]). In 187, the Han central government reassigned him to be the Administrator (\u592a\u5b88) of Jiaozhi Commandery (\u4ea4\u8dbe\u90e1) in [[Jiao Province]].{{sfnp|Taylor|1983|p=70}}\n\n==As a warlord in Jiao Province==\n[[File:End of Han Dynasty Warlords.png|thumb|450px|Map showing the major warlords of the Han dynasty in the 190s, including Shi Xie]]\n\nAround the time, Zhu Fu (\u6731\u7b26) had been appointed by the Han government to serve as the Inspector of [[Jiao Province]]. However, the locals in Jiao Province rebelled and killed him after he attempted to extract heavier taxes from them. The Han government then sent Zhang Jin (\u5f35\u6d25) to replace him, but Zhang Jin was later murdered by his subordinate Ou Jing (\u5340\u666f). When [[Liu Biao]], the Governor of [[Jing Province]], heard about this, he appointed Lai Gong (\u8cf4\u606d) as the new Inspector of Jiao Province without authorisation from the Han central government. At the same time, he also sent his subordinate Wu Ju (\u5433\u5de8) to replace the deceased Shi Huang (\u53f2\u749c) as the Administrator of Cangwu Commandery (\u84bc\u68a7\u90e1). To counter Liu Biao's attempts to extend his influence into Jiao Province, the Han central government issued an imperial decree appointing Shi Xie as General of the Household Who Pacifies the South (\u7d8f\u5357\u4e2d\u90ce\u5c07) and putting him in charge of the seven commanderies in Jiao Province.\n\nAfter Shi Xie sent his subordinate Zhang Min (\u5f35\u65fb) to thank the Han central government and pay tribute, the Han central government further promoted him to General Who Stabilises Distant Lands (\u5b89\u9060\u5c07\u8ecd), in addition to enfeoffing him as the Marquis of Longdu Village (\u9f8d\u5ea6\u4ead\u4faf). Around the time, the Han Empire was in a state of chaos, as various warlords fought for power and territories in northern and central China. Jiao Province, being a remote province in southern China, was not caught up in the chaos. Shi Xie was effectively a warlord in control of Jiao Province even though he was still a nominal subject of the Han Empire. Shi Xie's younger brothers also held important positions in Jiao Province: Shi Yi (\u58eb\u58f9), Shi Hui (\u58eb\u4d4b) and Shi Wu (\u58eb\u6b66) were respectively the Administrators of Hepu (\u5408\u6d66), Jiuzhen (\u4e5d\u771f) and Nanhai (\u5357\u6d77) commanderies in Jiao Province.\n\nIn 210, Wu Ju got into conflict with Lai Gong and forced him out of Jiao Province. [[Sun Quan]], the warlord who controlled the territories in the [[Jiangnan|Jiangdong]] region bordering Jiao Province, appointed his subordinate [[Bu Zhi]] as the Inspector of Jiao Province to replace Lai Gong. Shi Xie led his followers to submit to Bu Zhi's governorship, but Wu Ju refused and secretly plotted to assassinate Bu Zhi. However, Bu Zhi sensed Wu Ju's intentions and managed to outwit and kill him. Sun Quan later appointed Shi Xie as General of the Left (\u5de6\u5c07\u8ecd) to honour him. At the same time, the warlord [[Cao Cao]], who controlled the Han central government, wanted to gain Shi Xie's support as an ally against Sun Quan, so he conferred the [[nine bestowments]] and other honours on Shi Xie in the name of [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] (the figurehead Han emperor under Cao Cao's control).\n\n==As a vassal of Eastern Wu==\nIn the years after the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty in 220, [[Sun Quan]] declared himself king and established the kingdom (later empire) of [[Eastern Wu]]. Shi Xie pledged loyalty to Sun Quan and sent one of his sons, Shi Xin (\u58eb\u5ede), as a hostage to Sun Quan to ensure his allegiance towards Wu. He also regularly sent tribute to Sun Quan.{{sfnp|Taylor|1983|p=70}} During the conflict between Wu and its ally-turned-rival state [[Shu Han]], Shi Xie sided with Wu and instigated Yong Kai (\u96cd\u95d3), a local tribal chief in Shu territory, to rebel against Shu rule and defect to Wu. In recognition of Shi Xie's efforts in inducing Yong Kai to defect, Sun Quan appointed Shi Xie as General of the Guards (\u885b\u5c07\u8ecd) and awarded him the title \"Marquis of Longbian\" (\u9f8d\u7de8\u4faf). Shi Xie died of illness in 226 around the age of 89.\n\n==Family==\n<center>\n;Shi Xie's family tree\n{{chart/start}}\n{{chart| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | ShiCi |ShiCi='''Shi Ci'''<br>\u58eb\u8cdc}}\n{{chart| | | | | | | | | |,|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|^|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| |}}\n{{chart| | | | | | | | | ShiXie | | | | | | | | | | | | | | ShiYi | | ShiHui1 | | ShiWu |ShiXie='''Shi Xie'''<br>\u58eb\u71ee<br>{{small|(137\u2013226)}}|ShiYi='''Shi Yi'''<br>\u58eb\u58f9|ShiHui1='''Shi Hui'''<br>\u58eb\u4d4b|ShiWu='''Shi Wu'''<br>\u58eb\u6b66}}\n{{chart| |,|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | | | | | |!| }}\n{{chart| ShiXin | | ShiZhi | | ShiHui2 | | ShiGan | | ShiSong | | | | | | ShiKuang |ShiXin='''Shi Xin'''<br>\u58eb\u5ede|ShiZhi='''Shi Zhi'''<br>\u58eb\u7957|ShiHui2='''Shi Hui'''<br>\u58eb\u5fbd<br>{{small|(165\u2013227)}}|ShiGan='''Shi Gan'''<br>\u58eb\u5e79|ShiSong='''Shi Song'''<br>\u58eb\u980c|ShiKuang='''Shi Kuang'''<br>\u58eb\u5321}}\n{{chart/end}}\n</center>\n\nShi Xie had at least five sons (in decreasing order of seniority): Shi Xin (\u58eb\u5ede), Shi Zhi (\u58eb\u7957), [[Shi Hui (Three Kingdoms)|Shi Hui]] (\u58eb\u5fbd), Shi Gan (\u58eb\u5e79) and Shi Song (\u58eb\u980c).\n\nAfter Shi Xie died in 226, his third son Shi Hui succeeded him as the Administrator of [[Jiaozhi|Jiaozhi Commandery]] (\u4ea4\u8dbe\u90e1) under the [[Eastern Wu]] regime. Around the time, the Wu emperor [[Sun Quan]] wanted to split [[Jiao Province]] and create another province, Guang Province (\u5ee3\u5dde): Jiaozhi, Jiuzhen (\u4e5d\u771f) and Rinan (\u65e5\u5357) commanderies would remain part of Jiao Province; Cangwu (\u84bc\u68a7), Nanhai (\u5357\u6d77), Yulin (\u9b31\u6797) and Hepu (\u5408\u6d66) commanderies would form the new Guang Province. Sun Quan then appointed Dai Liang (\u6234\u826f) and [[L\u00fc Dai]] as the Inspectors of Jiao and Guang provinces respectively. Chen Shi (\u9673\u6642), a close aide of Sun Quan, was to replace Shi Hui as the Administrator of Jiaozhi Commandery.\n\nIn 227, when Shi Hui learnt about the new arrangements, he refused to comply and rebelled against Wu rule by sending his troops to block Dai Liang and Chen Shi from entering Jiao Province. At the time, Huan Lin (\u6853\u9130), one of Shi Hui's subordinates, begged his superior to obey the order and surrender his governorship of Jiaozhi Commandery to Chen Shi. However, Shi Hui refused and had Huan Lin flogged to death. Huan Lin's nephew, Huan Fa (\u6853\u767c), started a mutiny against Shi Hui and engaged him in a battle that lasted a few months. They made peace after that.\n\nIn the meantime, after learning of Shi Hui's rebellion, Sun Quan ordered L\u00fc Dai, the Inspector of Guang Province, to lead troops to recapture Jiaozhi Commandery. L\u00fc Dai, who was close to Shi Hui's cousin Shi Kuang (\u58eb\u5321; a son of Shi Xie's brother Shi Yi \u58eb\u58f9), sent Shi Kuang to persuade Shi Hui to surrender by promising that he would be spared if he did so. Shi Hui and his brothers then opened the gates of Jiaozhi Commandery and surrendered to L\u00fc Dai. The following day, L\u00fc Dai lured the Shi brothers into a trap during a banquet, had them arrested and then read out a list of Shi Hui's crimes. He then executed all of them and sent their heads to Sun Quan, who was in Wuchang (\u6b66\u660c; present-day [[Ezhou]], [[Hubei]]) at the time.\n\nShi Xie's brothers, Shi Yi (\u58eb\u58f9) and Shi Hui (\u58eb\u4d4b), along with their families, were spared from death but reduced to the status of commoners. Some years later, Shi Yi and Shi Hui were executed for committing crimes.\n\nEarlier in the 220s, Shi Xie had sent his eldest son, Shi Xin (\u58eb\u5ede), as a hostage to Sun Quan to ensure the Wu emperor of his allegiance towards him. Shi Xin thus avoided ending up like Shi Hui and his other brothers, who were executed by L\u00fc Dai in 227. Like the rest of the Shi family who survived (e.g. his uncles Shi Yi and Shi Hui \u58eb\u4d4b), he was reduced to the status of a commoner after his brothers' deaths. He died of illness some time later and had no son to succeed him.\n\n==Worship of \"King S\u0129\", S\u0129 Ti\u1ebfp in Vietnam==\nSome Chinese heroes were deified in [[Name of Vietnam|Annam]] after the [[End of the Han dynasty|fall of the Han dynasty]] in 220. Among them was Shi Xie, who was deified in the sixth century. As one of the officials who ruled northern Annam in the 1st century, he was given the [[posthumous name]] ''Thi\u00ean C\u1ea3m Gia \u1ee8ng Linh V\u0169 \u0110\u1ea1i V\u01b0\u01a1ng'' ({{linktext|\u5584|\u611f|\u5609|\u61c9|\u9748|\u6b66|\u5927|\u738b}}) by an emperor of Vietnam's [[Tr\u1ea7n dynasty]], as recorded in the ''[[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t s\u1eed k\u00fd to\u00e0n th\u01b0]]'' ({{linktext|\u5927|\u8d8a|\u53f2|\u8a18|\u5168|\u66f8}}), and ''History of King Si'' ({{lang|vi|K\u1ef3 S\u0129 V\u01b0\u01a1ng}}).\n\nShi Xie is still honoured in some Vietnamese temples today as \"King Si\" ({{lang|vi|S\u0129 V\u01b0\u01a1ng}}).{{sfnp|Schafer|1967|p=99}} The Vietnamese history ''[[Vi\u1ec7t \u0110i\u1ec7n U Linh T\u1eadp]]'' ({{linktext|\u8d8a|\u7538|\u5e7d|\u9748|\u96c6}}; {{circa}} 1400) adds significantly to the traditions of the Chinese records with local Vietnamese traditions.{{sfnp|Dror|2007|p=15}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* [[Chen Shou|Chen, Shou]] (3rd century).

The hour outside of the cell is for exercise and a phone call if they have earned the privilege. Their diet is restricted to ensure that the food cannot be used to harm themselves or to create unhygienic conditions in their cell. Some cells have showers which reduces the amount of handling that Correctional Officers have to perform.<ref name=\"cbc.ca\"/>\n\nInmates are gradually allowed out for longer periods after at least one year, depending on their conduct.

It is located in [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[Fremont County, Colorado]], near [[Florence, Colorado|Florence]],<!--The prison is **not** in the Florence city limits.

Phones are generally banned and only limited broadcast entertainment is permitted. After three years in maximum confinement, some prisoners may be transferred to a less restrictive prison. The aim is to encourage \"reasonably peaceful behavior\" from the most violent \"career\" prisoners.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4lvpjT-f0I&list=PLYHpXNzTgy9O92R5RCW-i2Fu761HISIu3&index=24</ref>\n\n==Function==\nThe institution is unofficially known as '''ADX Florence''', or the \"[[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary|Alcatraz]] of the Rockies\".<ref name=\"alcatraz\">{{cite news |last = Fernandes | first = Edna | title = Supermax prison, the Alcatraz of the Rockies| work = | pages = | language = | publisher = The Times | date = 2006-05-04| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article713240.ece | accessdate = 2008-05-31 | location=London}}</ref> It is part of the [[Florence Federal Correctional Complex]], which is operated by the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] (BOP), a division of the [[United States Department of Justice]].

These inmates are kept in administrative segregation. They are confined in a single-person cell for 23 hours a day and are removed under restraint (handcuffed, shackled, or both); their one hour out of their cell may occur at any time of the day or night. The hour outside of the cell is for exercise and a phone call if they have earned the privilege. Their diet is restricted to ensure that the food cannot be used to harm themselves or to create unhygienic conditions in their cell. Some cells have showers which reduces the amount of handling that Correctional Officers have to perform.<ref name=\"cbc.ca\"/>\n\nInmates are gradually allowed out for longer periods after at least one year, depending on their conduct. The long-term goal is to keep them at ADX for no more than three years and then transfer them to a less restrictive prison to serve out the remainder of their sentences.
