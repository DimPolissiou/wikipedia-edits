Their primary objective was to force [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Egypt under Muhammad Ali and his successors|Egyptian]] ally, to evacuate the occupied regions and the Peloponnese. The intervention began when a [[Bourbon Restoration|Franco]]-[[Russian Empire|Russo]]-[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] fleet was sent to the region and won the [[Battle of Navarino]] in October 1827. In August 1828, a French expeditionary corps of 15,000 men led by [[Nicolas Joseph Maison|General Nicolas-Joseph Maison]] landed in the southwestern Peloponnese. During October, soldiers took control of the principal strongholds still held by the Turkish troops. Although the bulk of the troops returned to France in early 1829 after an 8 month-deployment, the French kept a military presence in the area until 1833. The French army, however, suffered numerous human losses, mainly due to [[fever]] and [[dysentery]], with around 1,500 dead.\n\nAs had occurred during [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|Egyptian Campaign]], when a [[Commission des Sciences et des Arts]] accompanied the military campaign, a scientific commission (''Exp\u00e9dition scientifique de Mor\u00e9e'') was attached to the French troops and placed under the supervision of three [[Academy|academies]] of the [[Institut de France]]. Directed by the naturalist and geographer [[Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent|Jean-Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent]], nineteen scientists representing different specialties in [[natural history]], [[archaeology]] and [[architecture]]-[[sculpture]] made the voyage to Greece in March 1829; most of them stayed there for 9 months. Their work proved essential to the ongoing development of the [[First Hellenic Republic|new Greek State]] and, more broadly, marked a major milestone in the modern history of archaeology, cartography and natural sciences, as well as in the study of Greece.<ref name=\":9\">Yiannis Sa\u00eftas et al., ''L'\u0153uvre de l'exp\u00e9dition scientifique de Mor\u00e9e 1829-1838'', Edited by Yiannis Sa\u00eftas, Editions Melissa, 2011 (Part I) - 2017 (Part II).</ref><ref name=\":11\">Marie-No\u00eblle Bourguet, Bernard Lepetit, [[:fr:Daniel Nordman|Daniel Nordman]], Maroula Sinarellis, ''L\u2019Invention scientifique de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. \u00c9gypte, Mor\u00e9e, Alg\u00e9rie.'', \u00c9ditions de l\u2019EHESS, 1998.

They won numerous victories early on and declared independence on 1 January 1822. However, the declaration contradicted the principles of the [[Congress of Vienna]] and of the [[Holy Alliance]], which imposed a European equilibrium of the ''status quo'', outlawing any possible change. In contrast to what happened elsewhere in Europe, the Holy Alliance did not intervene to stop the [[Liberalism|liberal]] Greek insurgents.\n\nThe liberal and national uprising displeased [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]], chancellor of the [[Austrian Empire]] and the principal political architect of the Holy Alliance. Russia looked favourably on the insurrection due to its [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] religious solidarity and its geostrategic interest (control of the [[Dardanelles]] and the [[Bosphorus]]). France, another active member of the Holy Alliance, had just intervened in Spain against liberals at [[Battle of Trocadero|Trocadero]] (1823) but held an ambiguous position: Paris saw the liberal Greeks first and foremost as Christians, and their uprising against the Muslim Ottomans had undertones of a new crusade.<ref name=\"Athanassoglou-Kallmyer1989\">{{cite book|author=Nina Athanassoglou-Kallmyer|title=French Images from the Greek War of Independence (1821-1830): Art and Politics Under the Restoration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=unXeZpkaxTMC&pg=PA124|year=1989|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-04532-1|page=124}}</ref> Great Britain, a liberal country, was interested in the situation of the region, primarily because it was on the route to [[British East India Company|India]] and London wished to exert there a form of control.<ref name=\":7\">C.

By the [[Treaty of London (1827)|Treaty of London]] of July 1827,<ref group=\"N\">[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k96067j/f505.table The text on Gallica]</ref> France, Russia and the United Kingdom recognised the autonomy of Greece, which remained a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire. The three powers agreed to a limited intervention in order to convince the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] to accept the terms of the convention. A plan to send a naval expedition as a demonstration of force was proposed and adopted; subsequently a joint Russian, French and British fleet was sent to exert diplomatic pressure against Constantinople.<ref name=\":7\" /> The [[Battle of Navarino]] (20 October 1827), fought after a chance encounter, resulted in the destruction of the Turkish-Egyptian fleet.\n\n[[File:The Battle of Navarino 20 October 1827.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Navarino]], on 20 October 1827, where the Allied naval forces (Britain, France and Russia) decisively defeated the Ottoman and Egyptian fleet]]\nIn 1828, Ibrahim Pasha thus found himself in a difficult situation: he had just suffered a defeat at Navarino; the joint fleet enforced a blockade which prevented him from receiving reinforcements and supplies; and his Albanian troops, whom he could no longer pay, had returned to their country under the protection of [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]]' Greek troops. On 6 August 1828, a convention had been signed at [[Alexandria]] between the viceroy of Egypt, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], and the British admiral [[Edward Codrington]]. By its terms, Ibrahim Pasha was required  to evacuate his Egyptian troops and leave the Peloponnese to the few Turkish troops (estimated at 1,200 men) remaining there, but he refused to honour the agreement and continued to control various Greek regions: [[Messenia]], [[Pylos|Navarino]], and [[Patras]] as well as several other strongholds\u2014and even ordered the systematic destruction of [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitza]].<ref> Brunet de Presle, Alexandre Blanchet, ''La Gr\u00e8ce'', p. 555.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the French government of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] was beginning to have doubts about its Greek policy.<ref>de Presle, p. 556.</ref> Ibrahim Pasha himself noted this ambiguity when he met [[Nicolas Joseph Maison|General Maison]] in September.<ref>Arch de Vaulabelle, ''Histoire des deux Restaurations'', vol. 7, p. 472, \"Why was France, after enslaving men in Spain in 1823, now coming to Greece to make free men?\"</ref>  Eventually a pro-Greek liberal movement, inspired by what was then happening in Greece, began to develop in France. The longer France waited to act, the more delicate her position vis-\u00e0-vis Metternich became. The ultra-royalist government thus decided to accelerate events. A proposal to send a joint land expedition was made to Great Britain, which refused to intervene directly. Meanwhile, Russia had [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u20131829)|declared war against the Ottoman Empire]] and its military victories were unsettling for Great Britain, which did not wish to see the Tsarist empire extend too far south, and compelled it to not oppose an intervention by France alone.<ref>Arch. de Vaulabelle, ''Histoire des deux Restaurations'', vol. 7, p. 649.</ref>\n\n===Intellectual context===\n[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophy had stimulated Western Europeans' interest in Greece, or rather in an idealised [[ancient Greece]], the linchpin of [[classical antiquity]] as it was perceived and taught in academe. [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers, for whom the notions of Nature and Reason were so important, believed that these had been the fundamental values of classical Athens. The ancient Greek democracies, and above all [[Athenian democracy|Athens]], became models to emulate. There they searched for answers to the political and philosophical problems of their time. Works such as Abb\u00e9 [[Jean-Jacques Barth\u00e9lemy|Barth\u00e9lemy]]'s ''[[Anacharsis|Voyage du Jeune Anacharsis]]'' (1788) served to fix definitively the image that Europe had of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].\n\n[[File:Prise de Coron par le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de brigade S\u00e9bastiani.jpg|thumb|Capture of Koroni by General Sebastiani ([[Hippolyte Lecomte]])]]\nThe theories and system of interpreting ancient art devised by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] influenced European tastes for decades. His major work, ''History of Ancient Art'', was published in 1764 and translated into French in 1766 (the English translation did not appear until 1881). In this major work Winckelmann initiated the tradition of dividing ancient art into periods, classifying the works chronologically and stylistically.<ref>Alain Schnapp, ''La Conqu\u00eate du pass\u00e9. Aux origines de l'arch\u00e9ologie.'', Editions Carr\u00e9, Paris, 1993. p. 258.</ref>\n\nThe views of Winckelmann on art encompassed the entirety of civilisation. He drew a parallel between a civilisation's general level of development and the evolution of its art. He interpreted this artistic evolution the same way that his contemporaries saw the life cycle of a civilisation in terms of progress\u2014apogee and then decline.<ref>Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny, ''Taste and the Antique.'', Yale University Press, 1981, p. 104.</ref> For him, the golden age of Greek art had been the pinnacle of artistic achievement,<ref name=\"Nivala2017\">{{cite book|author=Asko Nivala|title=The Romantic Idea of the Golden Age in Friedrich Schlegel's Philosophy of History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PzUlDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA150|date=3 February 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-79728-3|pages=150\u2013151}}</ref> culminating with the career of the sculptor [[Phidias]]. Further, Winckelmann believed that the most beautiful works of Greek art had been produced under ideal geographic, political and religious circumstances. This frame of thought long dominated intellectual life in Europe. He classified Greek art into four periods: Ancient (archaic period), Sublime (Phidias), Beautiful ([[Praxiteles]]) and Decadent (Roman period).\n\n[[File:Burrow Parthenon.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Parthenon]] at the time of [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]]]]\nWinckelmann concluded his theory on the evolution of art with an explication of the Sublime period of Greek art, which had been conceived during a period of political and religious liberty. His theories idealised ancient Greece and increased Europeans's desire to travel to contemporary Greece. It was seductive to believe, as he did, that 'good taste' was born beneath the Greek sky. He persuaded 18th-century Europe that life in ancient Greece was pure, simple and moral, and that classical Hellas was the source from which artists should draw ideas of \"noble simplicity and calm grandeur\".<ref>Cited by Roland and Fran\u00e7oise Etienne, ''La Gr\u00e8ce antique.'', Gallimard, 1990, p. 60-61.</ref> Greece became the \"motherland of the arts\" and \"the teacher of taste\".<ref>Roland and Fran\u00e7oise Etienne, ''La Gr\u00e8ce antique.'', Gallimard, 1990, p. 44-45.</ref>\n\nThe French government had planned the Morea expedition in the same spirit as those of [[James Stuart (1713-1788)|James Stuart]] and [[Nicholas Revett]], whose work it wished to complete. The semi-scientific expeditions commissioned and financed by the [[Society of Dilettanti]] remained a benchmark: these represented the first attempts to rediscover ancient Greece. The first, that of Stuart and Revett to Athens and the islands, took place in 1751\u20131753, and resulted in publication of ''The Antiquities of Athens'', a work mined by architects and designers for models of a refined \"Grecian\" [[neoclassicism]]. The expedition of Revett, [[Richard Chandler]] and William Pars to Asia Minor took place between 1764 and 1766. Finally, the removal by [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] of half of the surviving marble sculptures of the [[Parthenon]], as well as sculptures from other buildings, and their transport to Britain at the beginning of the 19th century, had inspired further philhellenic longing for the cultural glories of ancient Greece: it now seemed possible to build vast collections of ancient art in Western Europe.\n\n==Military expedition==\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Cogniet - Nicolas-Joseph Maison (1771-1840) - MV 1168.jpg|thumb|General [[Nicolas Joseph Maison]], Commander-in-Chief of the expeditionary corps from 1828 to 1829]]\nThe Chamber of Deputies authorised a loan of 80 million gold [[French franc|francs]] to allow the government to meet its obligations for the expedition.<ref>Antoine Calmon, ''Histoire parlementaire des finances de la Restauration.'', Michel L\u00e9vy, 1868\u20131870, vol. 2, p. 313.</ref> An expeditionary corps of 13,000\u201315,000 men<ref>Sources differ on this point.

He had exercised his eye in many expertises, had probably gleaned a little to the right and to the left, especially in the conversation of his master, who made him obtain, at the [[Louvre|Louvre Museum]], a fairly important place. Tall, fat, lively, cheerful, an appearance of [[M. and Mme. Joseph Prudhomme|Joseph Prudhomme]], with whom gold glasses gave him even more resemblance. His repertoire of workshop charges, although varied, was not inexhaustible, however; the jokes and the stories he told in a funny way, repeated themselves a little; some dated from the time of the [[First French Empire|Empire]], but I did not know them, and they amused me. He was married and lived in Paris, with his wife and young daughter, in a modest but comfortable interior; during our excursion, I often heard him regret this family life, without ever having wanted to go deeper into what he regretted the most, because it was especially during our meals that he complained.

His clothing, in the ceremonies or in the visits that we were going to pay to the authorities, was of a grotesque completion. He had combined in a very bizarre mixture the costume of a colonel and that of a member of the Institute. But he was not aware, or pretended not to notice, the amazement he caused everywhere. From the first days, he let his ambition, which he did not stop having during the trip, to pass for the supreme head of the commission, and I quickly noticed the coldness that Mr. Blouet and Mr. Dubois testified to him when he let his pretensions appear too much. As an indifferent spectator of this little antagonism, I could easily foresee how much the results of the expedition would suffer from that. I am probably mistaken; but I find difficult to understand a commission of this nature without a single chief, who directs the whole and who assumes all the responsibility. There were at our head three chiefs: they were already too many, and who were intended, and soon, to each pull their own side... It is true that there are many other circumstances for which I do admit only one master. Therefore, I repeat, I am probably wrong.

Its itinerary followed that of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias the Periegete]]. The sites had to be precisely located by precise triangulation, then, with the help of the architectural section, the archaeology section had to make the plans (general and by building), to draw and cast the buildings and their decorations, and to start excavations to clear buildings and [[antiquities]]. Byzantine monasteries had been added to the itinerary, and the section was tasked with attempting to buy some manuscripts from them.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[File:Blouet Olympie 1831.jpg|thumb|[[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] in 1829 as seen by the Morea expedition]]\nThe archaeology section, however, did not succeed in achieving the ambitious program originally set. Its members suffered from numerous diseases and [[fever]]s and began quarreling. [[Charles Lenormant]], for instance, when he learned that he was under the orders of Dubois, or at least that he was going to go along with him, did not think he should accept this position with a man who was his subordinate at the Louvre (he was just returning from the Egyptian archaeological expedition organised by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion]] in 1828); consequently he made the trip as an amateur and alone.<ref name=\":10\" /> [[Edgar Quinet]], the prominent French historian, intellectual and politician, who did not care to be a subordinate nor for collaborating on a book\u2014he already intended to publish one by himself\u2014told Dubois that he did not have to count on him, and that he would go alone.<ref name=\":10\" /> Quinet visited [[Piraeus]] on 21 April 1829, thence reaching Athens.

But the two most curious types of the commission were, without question, Edgar Quinet and Vietty, sculptor from Lyon. [...] The sculptor, a sort of peasant of the Danube, for the form at least, was said to have a deep education: he knew Greek as much as a man from France; so he treated the inhabitants of the Morea like donkeys, because they did not understand the language of Homer: finally, more Hellenist than sculptor.\" and p. 103: \"Did he intend to teach the language of Homer to modern Greeks? Perhaps, because we were told later that, willing to enter a closed city by force, he had addressed in Greek to the sentry a speech so little understood, especially with French pronunciation, that, to end it, we had driven to the police station. The fact remains that he left us, and that I never saw him again.\" Indeed, Vietty died soon after in France in 1842, in great poverty and without having published a single page of her research in the Morea (according to the testimony of geologist Virlet d'Aoust in a letter to the ministry in 1843, see previous note on St\u00e9phane Gioanni's study). As for [[Edgar Quinet]] when he left the commission (p. 104, Chapter VII): \"Mounted on a donkey that was partly hiding his huge coat, he was wearing a huge woman's straw hat, the edges of which, lifted by the wind, let see a pink silk ribbon tied under the neck and floating on his chest. On both sides of the saddle were attached species of baskets filled with books; behind, the guide and a horse loaded with the rest of the luggage. He passed thus in the middle of the crowd, without noticing the effect it produced, and without suspecting that it was going to be an extended theme for the officers' conversations and lazzi.\" Eug\u00e8ne-Emmanuel Amaury-Duval, ''[[iarchive:souvenirs182918300amau/page/n7/mode/2up|Souvenirs (1829-1830)]]'', Librairie Plon, E.

The presence of the troops from the expeditionary corps was important, alternating with that of the Greek shepherds: \"[...] their generous hospitality and simple and innocent manners reminded us of the beautiful period of pastoral life which fiction calls the [[Golden age]], and which seemed to offer the real characters of the [[Theocritus]]' and [[Virgil]]'s [[eclogue]]s.\" <ref name=\":2\">Blouet, 1831, v.

Thus, at [[Cape Zonchio|Cape Coryphasium]] near Navarino (''Paleokastro, [[Old Navarino castle|Old Navarino]] or Zonchio''), the location of the city of the Homeric [[Nestor (mythology)|King Nestor]], the famous [[Pylos]], was determined for the first time from the adjectives \"inaccessible\" and \"sandy\" (''\u1f20\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2'') used in the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' (the [[palace of Nestor]], located higher up in the land, was not discovered until 1939 by the American archaeologist [[Carl Blegen]]). Blouet added: \"These Hellenic constructions, which no modern traveller had yet mentioned, and which I had noticed in a previous visit, were for us an important discovery and a very-plausible reason to convince us that we saw the Pylos of Messinia.\"<ref>Blouet, 1831, v. I, pp. 5-6</ref> Similarly, a little further, he says about the city of Modon ([[Methoni, Messenia#Antiquity and Byzantine era|Methoni]]), the Homeric city of [[Pedasus (Messenia)|Pedasus]]: \"the ancient remains of the port, whose description agrees perfectly with that of Pausanias, are sufficient to determine with certainty the location of the ancient city.\"<ref>Blouet, 1831, v. I, p. 12.</ref>\n\n==== The first archaeological excavations of the Ancient Messene ====\nHaving explored Navarino, Methoni and Koroni, the members of the section went to the ancient city of [[Messene]] (founded in 369 BC by the Theban general [[Epaminondas]] after his victory over Sparta at [[Battle of Leuctra|Leuctra]]), located on the slopes of Mounts  [[Ithome]] and Eva. They spent a full month there from April 10, 1829, where they were warmly welcomed by the inhabitants of the village of [[Mavrommati, Ithomi|Mavrommati]]. They were the first archaeologists to carry out scientific excavations on this site of [[classical Greece]].<ref>\"During the month that we spent at Messene, I requested some rather considerable excavations, the results of which were not without importance for our work\". in Blouet, 1831, v. I, p. 12</ref>\n\nThey found there the famous fortified and crenelated surrounding walls of Epaminondas in a perfect state of preservation. There were two monumental [[Portal (architecture)|portals]] in the wall, one of which, having a [[lintel]] or [[architrave]] of an extraordinary 6 meters in length, was described by Blouet as \"perhaps the most beautiful in all of Greece\".<ref>Blouet, 1831, v. I, p. 40.</ref> This enclosure initially allowed them to delimit the site and to \"give a general plan of Messene with the most meticulous and precise topographic details.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> Then, they proceeded to the proper excavation of the archaeological site. They unearthed for the first time many fragments of stadium bleachers, drum sections and capitals of columns, porticoes, altars, bas-reliefs, sculptures and inscriptions (noted by Charles Lenormant, still present at that time). These excavations, carried out by means of dug trenches, enabled them to determine the precise plans of the foundations of the monuments and thus to propose restored models of the [[stadium]] of Messene and its [[heroon]], as well as the small theater or [[ekklesiasterion]]. However, they did not find all monuments, including the great theater and the ''Arsino\u00eb'' fountain. Only the ''Clepsydra'' fountain (where according to Pausanias, Zeus as a child was washed by the nymphs Ithome and Neda), located higher in the village of Mavrommati, was described and drawn.[[File:Prosper Baccuet - Mess\u00e8ne - Morea Expedition 1829.jpg|center|thumb|620x620px|The members of the scientific commission of the Morea Expedition studying the ruins of the stadium of [[Messene|ancient Messene]] (detail of a lithograph by [[Prosper Baccuet]])]]\n\n==== The first archaeological excavations of Olympia and the discovery of the temple of Olympian Zeus ====\n[[File:Plain d'Olympie.

The site of Olympia had been rediscovered in 1766 by the English antiquarian [[Richard Chandler]]. Since then, it had been visited by many other travellers such as [[Louis-Fran\u00e7ois-S\u00e9bastien Fauvel|Fauvel]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville|Pouqueville]], [[William Gell|Gell]], [[Charles Robert Cockerell|Cokerell]] and [[William Martin Leake|Leake]]. Its general identification by the archaeologists of the Morea expedition was made possible thanks to the more precise descriptions of [[Edward Dodwell]] (for Dubois) and [[John Spencer Stanhope]] (for Blouet). Most of the buildings were invisible, because as Abel Blouet noted, they must have been covered with a thick layer of sediment due to the frequent overflows of rivers [[Alfeios]] and [[Kladeos]].<ref group=\"N\">\"''Another observation which completely destroys these assumptions, is that the excavations which we had made at the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|temple of Olympian Jupiter]], proved to us that the ancient soil of the plain was 10 and 12 feet below the modern soil. In this modern soil, which is a ground of alluvium brought by the waters of both the [[Alfeios]] and those which came down from the sandy mountains that surround the valley, one should not look for traces of the hippodrome and the stadium, since this land did not exist when there was a stadium and an hippodrome''.\" Abel Blouet, 1831, v. I, p. 58</ref>\n\nOnly a single large fragment of a Doric column was visible. It had already been spotted by the previous travellers because the inhabitants of neighboring villages had dug trenches there to remove the stone, but none of them had attributed it with certainty to the temple of Zeus. Abel Blouet specified:<ref name=\":17\">Blouet, 1831, v. I, p. 61</ref> \"Therefore, there could have been no merit in discovering a monument there. But what could have been a discovery was to find evidence that this monument was the famous [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|temple of Olympian Jupiter]]. And this is what our excavations have enabled us to demonstrate. When we arrived at Olympia, Mr. Dubois, director of the Archaeology section of our expedition, had already been there for a few days with Mr. Tr\u00e9zel and Mr. Amaury Duval, his collaborators. Following the instructions which had been given to him by the commission of the Institute, this antiquarian (Dubois) had begun the excavations of which the result had been the discovery of the first bases of the two columns of the [[Portico|pronaos]] and several fragments of sculpture.\" The archaeological advice of [[Jean-Nicolas Huyot]] was thus followed. Dubois installed his workers on the front side of the temple and Blouet installed his own on the back side in order to give these excavations all possible extension. The painter [[Eug\u00e8ne Emmanuel Amaury Duval|Amaury-Duval]] gave in his ''[[iarchive:souvenirs182918300amau/page/n7/mode/2up|Souvenirs (1829-1830)]]'' a personal, direct and precise, testimony<ref group=\"N\"> \"Before looking for a site to establish our camp, a real natural curiosity made us go on an adventure. Some Greeks who plowed their field, as always with the pistol and the yatagan on their belts, offered to guide us. Mr. [[L\u00e9on-Jean-Joseph Dubois|Dubois]], believing that he already knew enough the place, wanted to do without their help, and chance made it so that I, who was far from having this pretension, arrived first on the site of the temple that my colleagues found, later, to be that of [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Olympian Zeus]]. Here is how. A Greek, whom Mr. Dubois had rejected, attached himself to me, and, probably looking for the tip, wanted to lead me to a place, which his pantomime made me suppose to be very interesting. \"Go ahead, if you like, said Mr. Dubois; but he will lead you to some uninteresting Roman ruin.\" So I followed my guide to a part of the almost inaccessible plain, covered with shrubs, grasses, huge stones, but shapeless and which rose from the ground at an equal distance. This confused heap of materials of all kinds seemed to me, however, to deserve attention. I came back to rejoin Mr. Dubois, whom I found disappointed to have encountered only uninviting ruins, very badly preserved, and nothing which seemed to lead to any discovery.

Their primary objective was to force [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Egypt under Muhammad Ali and his successors|Egyptian]] ally, to evacuate the occupied regions and the Peloponnese. The intervention began when a [[Bourbon Restoration|Franco]]-[[Russian Empire|Russo]]-[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] fleet was sent to the region and won the [[Battle of Navarino]] in October 1827. In August 1828, a French expeditionary corps of 15,000 men led by [[Nicolas Joseph Maison|General Nicolas-Joseph Maison]] landed in the southwestern Peloponnese. During October, soldiers took control of the principal strongholds still held by the Turkish troops. Although the bulk of the troops returned to France in early 1829 after an 8 month-deployment, the French kept a military presence in the area until 1833. The French army, however, suffered numerous human losses, mainly due to [[fever]] and [[dysentery]], with around 1,500 dead.\n\nAs had occurred during [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|Egyptian Campaign]], when a [[Commission des Sciences et des Arts]] accompanied the military campaign, a scientific commission (''Exp\u00e9dition scientifique de Mor\u00e9e'') was attached to the French troops and placed under the supervision of three [[Academy|academies]] of the [[Institut de France]]. Directed by the naturalist and geographer [[Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent|Jean-Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent]], nineteen scientists representing different specialties in [[natural history]], [[archaeology]] and [[architecture]]-[[sculpture]] made the voyage to Greece in March 1829; most of them stayed there for 9 months. Their work proved essential to the ongoing development of the [[First Hellenic Republic|new Greek State]] and, more broadly, marked a major milestone in the modern history of archaeology, cartography and natural sciences, as well as in the study of Greece.<ref name=\":9\">Yiannis Sa\u00eftas et al., ''L'\u0153uvre de l'exp\u00e9dition scientifique de Mor\u00e9e 1829-1838'', Edited by Yiannis Sa\u00eftas, Editions Melissa, 2011 (Part I) - 2017 (Part II).</ref><ref name=\":11\">Marie-No\u00eblle Bourguet, Bernard Lepetit, [[:fr:Daniel Nordman|Daniel Nordman]], Maroula Sinarellis, ''L\u2019Invention scientifique de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. \u00c9gypte, Mor\u00e9e, Alg\u00e9rie.'', \u00c9ditions de l\u2019EHESS, 1998.

They won numerous victories early on and declared independence on 1 January 1822. However, the declaration contradicted the principles of the [[Congress of Vienna]] and of the [[Holy Alliance]], which imposed a European equilibrium of the ''status quo'', outlawing any possible change. In contrast to what happened elsewhere in Europe, the Holy Alliance did not intervene to stop the [[Liberalism|liberal]] Greek insurgents.\n\nThe liberal and national uprising displeased [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]], chancellor of the [[Austrian Empire]] and the principal political architect of the Holy Alliance. Russia looked favourably on the insurrection due to its [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] religious solidarity and its geostrategic interest (control of the [[Dardanelles]] and the [[Bosphorus]]). France, another active member of the Holy Alliance, had just intervened in Spain against liberals at [[Battle of Trocadero|Trocadero]] (1823) but held an ambiguous position: Paris saw the liberal Greeks first and foremost as Christians, and their uprising against the Muslim Ottomans had undertones of a new crusade.<ref name=\"Athanassoglou-Kallmyer1989\">{{cite book|author=Nina Athanassoglou-Kallmyer|title=French Images from the Greek War of Independence (1821-1830): Art and Politics Under the Restoration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=unXeZpkaxTMC&pg=PA124|year=1989|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-04532-1|page=124}}</ref> Great Britain, a liberal country, was interested in the situation of the region, primarily because it was on the route to [[British East India Company|India]] and London wished to exert there a form of control.<ref name=\":7\">C.

The three powers agreed to a limited intervention in order to convince the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] to accept the terms of the convention. A plan to send a naval expedition as a demonstration of force was proposed and adopted; subsequently a joint Russian, French and British fleet was sent to exert diplomatic pressure against Constantinople.<ref name=\":7\" /> The [[Battle of Navarino]] (20 October 1827), fought after a chance encounter, resulted in the destruction of the Turkish-Egyptian fleet.\n\n[[File:The Battle of Navarino 20 October 1827.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Navarino]], on 20 October 1827, where the Allied naval forces (Britain, France and Russia) decisively defeated the Ottoman and Egyptian fleet]]\nIn 1828, Ibrahim Pasha thus found himself in a difficult situation: he had just suffered a defeat at Navarino; the joint fleet enforced a blockade which prevented him from receiving reinforcements and supplies; and his Albanian troops, whom he could no longer pay, had returned to their country under the protection of [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]]' Greek troops. On 6 August 1828, a convention had been signed at [[Alexandria]] between the viceroy of Egypt, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], and the British admiral [[Edward Codrington]]. By its terms, Ibrahim Pasha was required  to evacuate his Egyptian troops and leave the Peloponnese to the few Turkish troops (estimated at 1,200 men) remaining there, but he refused to honour the agreement and continued to control various Greek regions: [[Messenia]], [[Pylos|Navarino]], and [[Patras]] as well as several other strongholds\u2014and even ordered the systematic destruction of [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitza]].<ref> Brunet de Presle, Alexandre Blanchet, ''La Gr\u00e8ce'', p. 555.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the French government of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] was beginning to have doubts about its Greek policy.<ref>de Presle, p. 556.</ref> Ibrahim Pasha himself noted this ambiguity when he met [[Nicolas Joseph Maison|General Maison]] in September.<ref>Arch de Vaulabelle, ''Histoire des deux Restaurations'', vol. 7, p. 472, \"Why was France, after enslaving men in Spain in 1823, now coming to Greece to make free men?\"</ref>  Eventually a pro-Greek liberal movement, inspired by what was then happening in Greece, began to develop in France. The longer France waited to act, the more delicate her position vis-\u00e0-vis Metternich became. The ultra-royalist government thus decided to accelerate events. A proposal to send a joint land expedition was made to Great Britain, which refused to intervene directly. Meanwhile, Russia had [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u20131829)|declared war against the Ottoman Empire]] and its military victories were unsettling for Great Britain, which did not wish to see the Tsarist empire extend too far south, and compelled it to not oppose an intervention by France alone.<ref>Arch. de Vaulabelle, ''Histoire des deux Restaurations'', vol. 7, p. 649.</ref>\n\n===Intellectual context===\n[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophy had stimulated Western Europeans' interest in Greece, or rather in an idealised [[ancient Greece]], the linchpin of [[classical antiquity]] as it was perceived and taught in academe. [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers, for whom the notions of Nature and Reason were so important, believed that these had been the fundamental values of classical Athens. The ancient Greek democracies, and above all [[Athenian democracy|Athens]], became models to emulate. There they searched for answers to the political and philosophical problems of their time. Works such as Abb\u00e9 [[Jean-Jacques Barth\u00e9lemy|Barth\u00e9lemy]]'s ''[[Anacharsis|Voyage du Jeune Anacharsis]]'' (1788) served to fix definitively the image that Europe had of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].\n\n[[File:Prise de Coron par le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de brigade S\u00e9bastiani.jpg|thumb|Capture of Koroni by General Sebastiani ([[Hippolyte Lecomte]])]]\nThe theories and system of interpreting ancient art devised by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] influenced European tastes for decades. His major work, ''History of Ancient Art'', was published in 1764 and translated into French in 1766 (the English translation did not appear until 1881). In this major work Winckelmann initiated the tradition of dividing ancient art into periods, classifying the works chronologically and stylistically.<ref>Alain Schnapp, ''La Conqu\u00eate du pass\u00e9. Aux origines de l'arch\u00e9ologie.'', Editions Carr\u00e9, Paris, 1993. p. 258.</ref>\n\nThe views of Winckelmann on art encompassed the entirety of civilisation. He drew a parallel between a civilisation's general level of development and the evolution of its art. He interpreted this artistic evolution the same way that his contemporaries saw the life cycle of a civilisation in terms of progress\u2014apogee and then decline.<ref>Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny, ''Taste and the Antique.'', Yale University Press, 1981, p. 104.</ref> For him, the golden age of Greek art had been the pinnacle of artistic achievement,<ref name=\"Nivala2017\">{{cite book|author=Asko Nivala|title=The Romantic Idea of the Golden Age in Friedrich Schlegel's Philosophy of History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PzUlDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA150|date=3 February 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-79728-3|pages=150\u2013151}}</ref> culminating with the career of the sculptor [[Phidias]]. Further, Winckelmann believed that the most beautiful works of Greek art had been produced under ideal geographic, political and religious circumstances. This frame of thought long dominated intellectual life in Europe. He classified Greek art into four periods: Ancient (archaic period), Sublime (Phidias), Beautiful ([[Praxiteles]]) and Decadent (Roman period).\n\n[[File:Burrow Parthenon.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Parthenon]] at the time of [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]]]]\nWinckelmann concluded his theory on the evolution of art with an explication of the Sublime period of Greek art, which had been conceived during a period of political and religious liberty. His theories idealised ancient Greece and increased Europeans's desire to travel to contemporary Greece. It was seductive to believe, as he did, that 'good taste' was born beneath the Greek sky.

He had combined in a very bizarre mixture the costume of a colonel and that of a member of the Institute. But he was not aware, or pretended not to notice, the amazement he caused everywhere.

Its itinerary followed that of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias the Periegete]]. The sites had to be precisely located by precise triangulation, then, with the help of the architectural section, the archaeology section had to make the plans (general and by building), to draw and cast the buildings and their decorations, and to start excavations to clear buildings and [[antiquities]].

But the two most curious types of the commission were, without question, Edgar Quinet and Vietty, sculptor from Lyon. [...] The sculptor, a sort of peasant of the Danube, for the form at least, was said to have a deep education: he knew Greek as much as a man from France; so he treated the inhabitants of the Morea like donkeys, because they did not understand the language of Homer: finally, more Hellenist than sculptor.\" and p. 103: \"Did he intend to teach the language of Homer to modern Greeks? Perhaps, because we were told later that, willing to enter a closed city by force, he had addressed in Greek to the sentry a speech so little understood, especially with French pronunciation, that, to end it, we had driven to the police station. The fact remains that he left us, and that I never saw him again.\" Indeed, Vietty died soon after in France in 1842, in great poverty and without having published a single page of her research in the Morea (according to the testimony of geologist Virlet d'Aoust in a letter to the ministry in 1843, see previous note on St\u00e9phane Gioanni's study). As for [[Edgar Quinet]] when he left the commission (p. 104, Chapter VII): \"Mounted on a donkey that was partly hiding his huge coat, he was wearing a huge woman's straw hat, the edges of which, lifted by the wind, let see a pink silk ribbon tied under the neck and floating on his chest. On both sides of the saddle were attached species of baskets filled with books; behind, the guide and a horse loaded with the rest of the luggage.

The presence of the troops from the expeditionary corps was important, alternating with that of the Greek shepherds: \"[...] their generous hospitality and simple and innocent manners reminded us of the beautiful period of pastoral life which fiction calls the [[Golden age]], and which seemed to offer the real characters of the [[Theocritus]]' and [[Virgil]]'s [[eclogue]]s.\" <ref name=\":2\">Blouet, 1831, v.

Thus, at [[Cape Zonchio|Cape Coryphasium]] near Navarino (''Paleokastro, [[Old Navarino castle|Old Navarino]] or Zonchio''), the location of the city of the Homeric [[Nestor (mythology)|King Nestor]], the famous [[Pylos]], was determined for the first time from the adjectives \"inaccessible\" and \"sandy\" (''\u1f20\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2'') used in the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' (the [[palace of Nestor]], located higher up in the land, was not discovered until 1939 by the American archaeologist [[Carl Blegen]]). Blouet added: \"These Hellenic constructions, which no modern traveller had yet mentioned, and which I had noticed in a previous visit, were for us an important discovery and a very-plausible reason to convince us that we saw the Pylos of Messinia.\"<ref>Blouet, 1831, v.

They spent a full month there from April 10, 1829, where they were warmly welcomed by the inhabitants of the village of [[Mavrommati, Ithomi|Mavrommati]]. They were the first archaeologists to carry out scientific excavations on this site of [[classical Greece]].<ref>\"During the month that we spent at Messene, I requested some rather considerable excavations, the results of which were not without importance for our work\". in Blouet, 1831, v. I, p. 12</ref>\n\nThey found there the famous fortified and crenelated surrounding walls of Epaminondas in a perfect state of preservation. There were two monumental [[Portal (architecture)|portals]] in the wall, one of which, having a [[lintel]] or [[architrave]] of an extraordinary 6 meters in length, was described by Blouet as \"perhaps the most beautiful in all of Greece\".<ref>Blouet, 1831, v. I, p. 40.</ref> This enclosure initially allowed them to delimit the site and to \"give a general plan of Messene with the most meticulous and precise topographic details.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> Then, they proceeded to the proper excavation of the archaeological site. They unearthed for the first time many fragments of stadium bleachers, drum sections and capitals of columns, porticoes, altars, bas-reliefs, sculptures and inscriptions (noted by Charles Lenormant, still present at that time). These excavations, carried out by means of dug trenches, enabled them to determine the precise plans of the foundations of the monuments and thus to propose restored models of the [[stadium]] of Messene and its [[heroon]], as well as the small theater or [[ekklesiasterion]]. However, they did not find all monuments, including the great theater and the ''Arsino\u00eb'' fountain.

I, p. 56</ref> [[L\u00e9on-Jean-Joseph Dubois]] (Archaeology section) and [[Guillaume-Abel Blouet|Abel Blouet]] (Architecture and Sculpture section) undertook the first excavations there. They were accompanied by the painters [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Gournay]], [[Pierre Achille Poirot]], [[Pierre F\u00e9lix Trezel|Pierre F\u00e9lix Tr\u00e9zel]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Emmanuel Amaury Duval|Amaury-Duval]], as well as a troop of more than a hundred workers. The site of Olympia had been rediscovered in 1766 by the English antiquarian [[Richard Chandler]]. Since then, it had been visited by many other travellers such as [[Louis-Fran\u00e7ois-S\u00e9bastien Fauvel|Fauvel]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville|Pouqueville]], [[William Gell|Gell]], [[Charles Robert Cockerell|Cokerell]] and [[William Martin Leake|Leake]]. Its general identification by the archaeologists of the Morea expedition was made possible thanks to the more precise descriptions of [[Edward Dodwell]] (for Dubois) and [[John Spencer Stanhope]] (for Blouet). Most of the buildings were invisible, because as Abel Blouet noted, they must have been covered with a thick layer of sediment due to the frequent overflows of rivers [[Alfeios]] and [[Kladeos]].<ref group=\"N\">\"''Another observation which completely destroys these assumptions, is that the excavations which we had made at the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|temple of Olympian Jupiter]], proved to us that the ancient soil of the plain was 10 and 12 feet below the modern soil. In this modern soil, which is a ground of alluvium brought by the waters of both the [[Alfeios]] and those which came down from the sandy mountains that surround the valley, one should not look for traces of the hippodrome and the stadium, since this land did not exist when there was a stadium and an hippodrome''.\" Abel Blouet, 1831, v. I, p. 58</ref>\n\nOnly a single large fragment of a Doric column was visible. It had already been spotted by the previous travellers because the inhabitants of neighboring villages had dug trenches there to remove the stone, but none of them had attributed it with certainty to the temple of Zeus. Abel Blouet specified:<ref name=\":17\">Blouet, 1831, v. I, p. 61</ref> \"Therefore, there could have been no merit in discovering a monument there. But what could have been a discovery was to find evidence that this monument was the famous [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|temple of Olympian Jupiter]]. And this is what our excavations have enabled us to demonstrate. When we arrived at Olympia, Mr. Dubois, director of the Archaeology section of our expedition, had already been there for a few days with Mr. Tr\u00e9zel and Mr. Amaury Duval, his collaborators. Following the instructions which had been given to him by the commission of the Institute, this antiquarian (Dubois) had begun the excavations of which the result had been the discovery of the first bases of the two columns of the [[Portico|pronaos]] and several fragments of sculpture.\" The archaeological advice of [[Jean-Nicolas Huyot]] was thus followed. Dubois installed his workers on the front side of the temple and Blouet installed his own on the back side in order to give these excavations all possible extension. The painter [[Eug\u00e8ne Emmanuel Amaury Duval|Amaury-Duval]] gave in his ''[[iarchive:souvenirs182918300amau/page/n7/mode/2up|Souvenirs (1829-1830)]]'' a personal, direct and precise, testimony<ref group=\"N\"> \"Before looking for a site to establish our camp, a real natural curiosity made us go on an adventure. Some Greeks who plowed their field, as always with the pistol and the yatagan on their belts, offered to guide us. Mr. [[L\u00e9on-Jean-Joseph Dubois|Dubois]], believing that he already knew enough the place, wanted to do without their help, and chance made it so that I, who was far from having this pretension, arrived first on the site of the temple that my colleagues found, later, to be that of [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Olympian Zeus]]. Here is how. A Greek, whom Mr. Dubois had rejected, attached himself to me, and, probably looking for the tip, wanted to lead me to a place, which his pantomime made me suppose to be very interesting. \"Go ahead, if you like, said Mr. Dubois; but he will lead you to some uninteresting Roman ruin.\" So I followed my guide to a part of the almost inaccessible plain, covered with shrubs, grasses, huge stones, but shapeless and which rose from the ground at an equal distance. This confused heap of materials of all kinds seemed to me, however, to deserve attention. I came back to rejoin Mr. Dubois, whom I found disappointed to have encountered only uninviting ruins, very badly preserved, and nothing which seemed to lead to any discovery. My account made him think: he went, with [[Pierre F\u00e9lix Trezel|Tr\u00e9zel]] and me, towards the place I had just seen, and decided immediately that the excavations would be started there\", [[Eug\u00e8ne Emmanuel Amaury Duval]], [[iarchive:souvenirs182918300amau/page/n7/mode/2up|''Souvenirs (1829-1830)'']], Chapter IX, Librairie Plon, E.

The simple treasure hunt was beginning to be abandoned. The fundamental contribution of the Morea scientific expedition was its total indifference towards looting, treasure hunting, and antiquities smuggling. [[Guillaume-Abel Blouet|Blouet]] refused to perform excavations that risked damaging the monuments, and banned the mutilation of statues with the intent of taking a piece separated from the rest without regard, as [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Elgin]] had done on the Parthenon some twenty-five years before.<ref>Olga Polychronopoulou, ''Arch\u00e9ologues sur les pas d\u2019Hom\u00e8re.'', p. 33.</ref> It is perhaps for this reason that the three metopes of the temple of Zeus discovered at Olympia were transferred in their entirety to the [[Louvre|Louvre Museum]] (with the authorization of the Greek Government of Ioannis Kapodistrias).<ref name=\":17\" /><ref name=\"Murray2007\">{{cite book|author=Tim Murray|title=Milestones in Archaeology: A Chronological Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EZ7Gj2ocIEsC&pg=PA182|year=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-186-1|page=182}}</ref> However, many precious works they excavated were re-buried in order to protect them, according to the direct testimony of [[Eug\u00e8ne Emmanuel Amaury Duval|Amaury-Duval]].<ref group=\"N\"> \"We left the valley of the [[Alfeios]], with real sadness and regretting not being able to take away some souvenirs; but the fragments of sculpture, even the smallest, were of an embarrassing volume and weight.There was, among other works, a marble foot, of admirable work, which was still attached to a part of the base: lest it be subjected to yet another more complete mutilation, we went to bury it, [[Pierre F\u00e9lix Trezel|Tr\u00e9zel]] and I, in a deeply dug hole.

Since then it has been treated frequently by artists. It has also acquired idiomatic force and as such has been used as the title of several literary works.\n\n==The fable and its interpretation==\nA lion falls in love with a peasant's daughter and asks the father's permission to marry her. Unwilling to refuse outright, the man sets the condition that the animal should first have its claws clipped and its teeth filed. When the lion complies, the man clubs it to death, or in milder accounts simply drives it away, since it now can no longer defend itself.\n\nThough the story was included in early collections of Aesop's fables, including those of [[Babrius]] and [[Aphthonius of Antioch]], its earliest relation is as part of a war leader's speech in the 1st century BCE ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' of Diodorus Siculus, where it is described without ascription as an \"old story\".<ref>G. J. Van Dijk, ''Ainoi, Logoi, Mythoi'', Brill 1997 [https://books.google.com/books?id=QKQFJduPIdcC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA280#v=snippet&q=lion&f=false p.280-3]</ref> Significantly, the fable is interpreted there as a warning against ever letting down one's guard where an enemy is concerned and Aphthonius too comments that \"If you follow the advice of your enemies, you will run into danger\".\n\nBy the time the fable reappeared in Europe after the [[Renaissance]] it was being reinterpreted as a caution against being led astray by passion. The [[New Latin language|Neo-Latin]] poem ''Leo procus'' of [[Hieronymus Osius]] ends with the reflection \"By love the cleverest , sometimes, / are led astray, the strongest tamed\".<ref>''Phryx Aesopus'', [http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/osius/216.htm fable 216]</ref> A century later, [[Francis Barlow (artist)|Francis Barlow]]'s illustration of what he titles ''Leo Amatorius'' is summed up in the couplet \"Love asailes with powerfull charmes, / and both our Prudence and our strength disarmes\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/barlow/109.htm|title=109. Leo amatorius (1687), illustrated by Francis Barlow|work=mythfolklore.net}}</ref> La Fontaine titled his poem ''Le lion amoureux'' and ended with the sentiment \"O love, O love, mastered by you, / prudence we well may bid adieu\" (IV.1).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.la-fontaine-ch-thierry.net/fourliongarden.htm|title=the Lion in love, the Shepherd and the sea, the Fly and Ant, the Gardener and his Lord|work=la-fontaine-ch-thierry.net}}</ref>\n\nOne of the factors influencing this interpretation was the development of the Renaissance [[emblem]] associated with the Latin sentiment ''Amor vincit omnia'' (Love conquers all). In a medal struck in 1444, [[Pisanello]] pictures a lion fawning on winged Cupid.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O93542/leonello-deste-medal-pisanello|title=Leonello d'Este|work=vam.ac.uk}}</ref> This was reprised in the ''Emblemata amatoria'' (1607/8) of [[Dani\u00ebl Heinsius]] as a [[Cupid]] astride a rampant lion,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emblems.let.uu.nl/he1608001.html#folio_pbB2b|title=EPU - Dani\u00ebl Heinsius, Emblemata amatoria (1607/8) - Omnia vincit amor [1]|work=uu.nl}}</ref> accompanied in one edition by a poem in French in which Love boasts that \"the lion is conquered by my taming arrow\".<ref>[[:de:Emblem (Kunsthistorische Kategorie)#/media/File:Heinsius Emblem Quaeris quid 7.jpg|Wikimedia]]</ref> The interpretation is that even the fiercest nature can be tamed by love, but the reference to a lion inevitably brings to mind the well known instance of his fatal subjection to love in the fable. In illustrations during the following centuries, the lion fawns on his lady love in the same attitude as in Pisanello's medal, as for instance on the plate from the La Fontaine series of Keller & Guerin at the [[Luneville Faience|Luneville potteries]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.delcampe.net/page/item/id,74598615,var,DEUX-ASSIETTES--ANCIENNES-LUNEVILLE-KELLER-ET-GUERIN,language,F.html|title=DEUX ASSIETTES ANCIENNES LUNEVILLE KELLER ET GUERIN|work=delcampe.net}}</ref>\n\n==The fable in the arts==\nIllustrations of the fable were rare before the 19th century. In the 18th, it was the subject of an [[Aubusson tapestry]] to a design of [[Jean-Baptiste Oudry]],<ref>[[:File:Aubusson - Fables de La Fontaine 1.JPG|Wikimedia]]</ref> and in England it was painted during the 1790s by [[James Northcote]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/ngasanova70/album/158514/view/453733|title=\u042f\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441.\u0424\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438|work=\u042f\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441.\u0424\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Roqueplan.lion.in.love.wallace.coll.bbc.jpg|thumb|left|230px|[[Camille Roqueplan]]'s dark interpretation of the fable in the [[Wallace Collection]]]]\nIt was not until the 19th century that artists confronted the questionable morality of the human actors in the fable and treated the woman as more than a passive bystander. The change in attitude is evident in [[Camille Roqueplan]]'s painting of 1836 which makes the lion's love-object the one who clips its claws (see left), a detail absent from the text. Its iconography is reminiscent of the story of [[Delilah]]'s betrayal of [[Samson]] and especially those paintings in which Samson's head rests on her lap while she crops his hair and attackers lurk in the background.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wallacecollection.org/ms/learn/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/05/Wallace_Teachers_Notes_MythsandLegends_Final.pdf|format=PDF|title=Wallace Teaches Notes Myths and Legends|page=4|website=wallacecollection.org}}</ref> Another treatment of the theme is the 1851 statue by [[Guillaume Geefs]] in the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]], although in this case the lady is sitting on the lion's back as she works with her scissors.<ref>[http://worldvisitguide.com/oeuvre/photo_ME0000087576.html World Visit Guide]</ref>\n\nThe subject also lends itself to satirical interpretation and was chosen for this purpose by the Japanese caricaturist [[Kawanabe Ky\u014dsai]] for his ''Isoho Monogotari'' series (1870\u201380).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yajifun.tumblr.com/post/25229563478/yamtai-gurafiku-japanese-ukiyo-e-the-lion|title=yajifun\u8cbc\u4ea4\u5e33 (yamtai: gurafiku: Japanese Ukiyo-e: The lion...)|author=Peter Vidani|work=tumblr.com}}</ref> More recently [[Diane Victor]] has used it in her lithograph \"The lion who loved the lady\" (2011) to comment on the relationship between China and Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edgie.een.nl/2012/11/the-lion-who-loved-the-lady-by-diane-victor|title=edgie.een.nl|work=een.nl}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.art.co.za/dianevictor/2011_46.htm|title=art.co.za - Art in South Africa|work=art.co.za}}</ref> In other depictions too, as in paintings by [[Gustave Moreau]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.photo.rmn.fr/C.aspx?VP3=SearchResult&IID=2C6NU00VZ49C|title=R\u00e9union des Mus\u00e9es Nationaux-Grand Palais -|work=rmn.fr}}</ref> Adolphe Weisz (1838 \u2013 after 1900)<ref>[https://www.mutualart.com/Artwork/Le-Lion-Amoureux/DE530C248F18517A Mutual Art]</ref> and Henri Courcelles-Dumont (1856\u20131918),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.photo-arago.fr/Archive/27MQ2J2WE0U5/10/Le-lion-amoureux--2C6NU0XKTRYQ.html|title=Le lion amoureux|work=photo-arago.fr}}</ref> the woman flaunts her naked body in a show of power over the beast.

As such it was given to two paintings which showed a soldier helping a young woman with her needlework. [[Abraham Solomon]]'s, exhibited at the [[Royal Academy summer exhibition]] of 1858, depicted a grey-haired warrior in uniform trying to thread the needle of a lady seated beside him on a sofa,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/ngasanova70/album/158514/view/453732|title=\u042f\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441.\u0424\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438|work=\u042f\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441.\u0424\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438}}</ref> while the one by Emile Pierre Metzmacher (1815\u20131905), exhibited at the \n[[Exposition Universelle (1889)]], was a period piece in which a younger soldier tries his hand at tapestry.<ref>[http://www.pixel-pinxit.com/photos/2014/MD42/r/Copie%20de%2019.jpg Pixel-pinxit]</ref>\n\nIn literature the title was used for depiction of the emotional relationships of social lions.

Leo amatorius (1687), illustrated by Francis Barlow|work=mythfolklore.net}}</ref> La Fontaine titled his poem ''Le lion amoureux'' and ended with the sentiment \"O love, O love, mastered by you, / prudence we well may bid adieu\" (IV.1).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.la-fontaine-ch-thierry.net/fourliongarden.htm|title=the Lion in love, the Shepherd and the sea, the Fly and Ant, the Gardener and his Lord|work=la-fontaine-ch-thierry.net}}</ref>\n\nOne of the factors influencing this interpretation was the development of the Renaissance [[emblem]] associated with the Latin sentiment ''Amor vincit omnia'' (Love conquers all). In a medal struck in 1444, [[Pisanello]] pictures a lion fawning on winged Cupid.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O93542/leonello-deste-medal-pisanello|title=Leonello d'Este|work=vam.ac.uk}}</ref> This was reprised in the ''Emblemata amatoria'' (1607/8) of [[Dani\u00ebl Heinsius]] as a [[Cupid]] astride a rampant lion,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emblems.let.uu.nl/he1608001.html#folio_pbB2b|title=EPU - Dani\u00ebl Heinsius, Emblemata amatoria (1607/8) - Omnia vincit amor [1]|work=uu.nl}}</ref> accompanied in one edition by a poem in French in which Love boasts that \"the lion is conquered by my taming arrow\".<ref>[[:de:Emblem (Kunsthistorische Kategorie)#/media/File:Heinsius Emblem Quaeris quid 7.jpg|Wikimedia]]</ref> The interpretation is that even the fiercest nature can be tamed by love, but the reference to a lion inevitably brings to mind the well known instance of his fatal subjection to love in the fable. In illustrations during the following centuries, the lion fawns on his lady love in the same attitude as in Pisanello's medal, as for instance on the plate from the La Fontaine series of Keller & Guerin at the [[Luneville Faience|Luneville potteries]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.delcampe.net/page/item/id,74598615,var,DEUX-ASSIETTES--ANCIENNES-LUNEVILLE-KELLER-ET-GUERIN,language,F.html|title=DEUX ASSIETTES ANCIENNES LUNEVILLE KELLER ET GUERIN|work=delcampe.net}}</ref>\n\n==The fable in the arts==\nIllustrations of the fable were rare before the 19th century. In the 18th, it was the subject of an [[Aubusson tapestry]] to a design of [[Jean-Baptiste Oudry]],<ref>[[:File:Aubusson - Fables de La Fontaine 1.JPG|Wikimedia]]</ref> and in England it was painted during the 1790s by [[James Northcote]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/ngasanova70/album/158514/view/453733|title=\u042f\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441.\u0424\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438|work=\u042f\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441.\u0424\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Roqueplan.lion.in.love.wallace.coll.bbc.jpg|thumb|left|230px|[[Camille Roqueplan]]'s dark interpretation of the fable in the [[Wallace Collection]]]]\nIt was not until the 19th century that artists confronted the questionable morality of the human actors in the fable and treated the woman as more than a passive bystander. The change in attitude is evident in [[Camille Roqueplan]]'s painting of 1836 which makes the lion's love-object the one who clips its claws (see left), a detail absent from the text.

As such it was given to two paintings which showed a soldier helping a young woman with her needlework. [[Abraham Solomon]]'s, exhibited at the [[Royal Academy summer exhibition]] of 1858, depicted a grey-haired warrior in uniform trying to thread the needle of a lady seated beside him on a sofa,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/ngasanova70/album/158514/view/453732|title=\u042f\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441.\u0424\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438|work=\u042f\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441.\u0424\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438}}</ref> while the one by Emile Pierre Metzmacher (1815\u20131905), exhibited at the \n[[Exposition Universelle (1889)]], was a period piece in which a younger soldier tries his hand at tapestry.<ref>[http://www.pixel-pinxit.com/photos/2014/MD42/r/Copie%20de%2019.jpg Pixel-pinxit]</ref>\n\nIn literature the title was used for depiction of the emotional relationships of social lions.

A town often becomes a ghost town because the economic activity that supported it (usually industrial or agricultural) has failed, or due to natural or human-caused disasters such as [[floods]], prolonged [[drought]]s, government actions, uncontrolled [[lawlessness]], [[war]], [[pollution]], or [[Nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents|nuclear disasters]]. The term can sometimes refer to cities, towns, and neighbourhoods that are still populated, but significantly less so than in past years; for example, those affected by high levels of unemployment and dereliction.<ref name=Baker/>\n\nSome ghost towns, especially those that preserve period-specific architecture, have become tourist attractions. Some examples are [[Bannack, Montana|Bannack]] in the United States, [[Barkerville, British Columbia|Barkerville]] in Canada, [[Craco]] in Italy, [[Kolmanskop]] in Namibia, [[Pripyat]] in Ukraine, and [[Danushkodi]] in India.\n\nThe town of [[Plymouth, Montserrat|Plymouth]] on the Caribbean island of [[Montserrat]] is a ghost town that is the ''[[de jure]]'' [[Capital city|capital]] of Montserrat. It was rendered uninhabitable by volcanic ash from an eruption of the [[Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano]].\n\n==Definition==\nThe definition of a ghost town varies between individuals, and between cultures. Some writers discount settlements that were abandoned as a result of a natural or human-made disaster or other causes using the term only to describe settlements that were deserted because they were no longer economically viable; T. Lindsey Baker, author of ''Ghost Towns of Texas'', defines a ghost town as \"a town for which the reason for being no longer exists\".<ref name=Baker>{{cite book |last=Baker |first= T.

American author Lambert Florin's defined a ghost town as \"a shadowy semblance of a former self\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Shawn|title=Ghost Towns and Mining Camps of Southern Nevada|year=2010|publisher=Arcadia Pub.|location=Charleston, SC|isbn=0738570125|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DHLCS4HNjuQC&pg=PA7}}</ref>\n\n==Reasons for abandonment==\nFactors leading to the abandonment of towns include depleted natural resources, economic activity shifting elsewhere, railroads and roads bypassing or no longer accessing the town, human intervention, disasters, massacres, wars, and the shifting of politics or fall of empires.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Graves |first1=Philip |last2=Weiler |first2=Stephan |last3=Tynon |first3=Emily |ssrn=1540770 |title=The Economics of Ghost Towns|publisher=Social Science Research Network |date=25 January 2010}}</ref> A town can also be abandoned when it is part of an [[exclusion zone]] due to [[Plymouth, Montserrat|natural]] or [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone|man-made causes]].\n\n===Economic activity shifting elsewhere===\n[[File:Abandoned farmhouse, overgrown.jpg|thumb|right|As farms [[Intensive farming|industrialize]], smaller farms are no longer economically viable, leading to rural decay.]]\n\nGhost towns may result when the single activity or resource that created a [[boomtown]] (e.g., nearby mine, mill or resort) is depleted or the resource economy undergoes a \"bust\" (e.g., catastrophic resource price collapse). Boomtowns can often decrease in size as fast as they initially grew. Sometimes, all or nearly the entire population can desert the town, resulting in a ghost town.\n\nThe dismantling of a boomtown can often occur on a planned basis. Mining companies nowadays will create a temporary community to service a mine site, building all the accommodation, shops and services required, and then remove them once the resource has been extracted. Modular buildings can be used to facilitate the process. A [[gold rush]] would often bring intensive but short-lived economic activity to a remote village, only to leave a ghost town once the resource was depleted.\n\nIn some cases, multiple factors may remove the economic basis for a community; some former [[mining town]]s on [[U.S. Route 66]] suffered both mine closures when the resources were depleted and loss of highway traffic as US 66 was diverted away from places like [[Oatman, Arizona]] onto a more direct path. Mine and pulp mill closures have led to many ghost towns in British Columbia, Canada including several relatively recent ones: [[Ocean Falls]] which closed in 1973 after the pulp mill was decommissioned, [[Kitsault]] B.C. whose molybdenum mine shut down after only 18 months in 1982, and [[Cassiar, British Columbia|Cassiar]] whose asbestos mine operated from 1952 to 1992.\n\nIn other cases, the reason for abandonment can arise from a town's intended economic function shifting to another, nearby place. This happened to [[Collingwood, Queensland]] in [[Outback]] [[Australia]] when nearby [[Winton, Queensland|Winton]] outperformed Collingwood as a regional centre for the livestock-raising industry. The railway reached Winton in 1899, linking it with the rest of [[Queensland]], and Collingwood was a ghost town by the following year.\n\nThe Middle East has many ghost towns that were created when the shifting of politics or the fall of empires caused capital cities to be socially or economically unviable, such as [[Ctesiphon]].\n\nThe rise of condominium investment and a resulting real estate bubble may also lead to a ghost town, as real estate prices rise and affordable housing becomes less available. Such examples include China and Canada, where housing is often used as an investment rather than for habitation.<!---What does that first clause mean?--->\n\n===Human intervention===\n[[File:Famagusta-Varosha 2007.JPG|thumb|Prior to the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974, [[Varosha, Famagusta|Varosha]], now falling into ruin, once was a modern tourist area.]]\n[[File:Akarmaraghosttown.jpg|thumb|[[Akarmara]], a [[mining town]] in [[Abkhazia]]/[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], was abandoned in the early 1990s due to the [[War in Abkhazia (1992\u201393)|War in Abkhazia]].]]\nRailroads and roads bypassing or no longer reaching a town can also create a ghost town. This was the case in many of the ghost towns along Ontario's historic [[Opeongo Line]], and along [[U.S. Route 66]] after motorists bypassed the latter on the faster moving highways [[Interstate 44|I-44]] and [[Interstate 40|I-40]]. Some ghost towns were founded along railways where [[steam train]]s would stop at periodic intervals to take on water. [[Amboy, California]] was part of one such series of villages along the [[Atlantic and Pacific Railroad]] across the [[Mojave Desert]].\n\nRiver re-routing is another factor, one example being the towns along the [[Aral Sea]].\n\nGhost towns may be created when land is [[eminent domain|expropriated]] by a government, and residents are required to relocate. One example is the village of [[Tyneham]] in [[Dorset]], England, acquired during World War II to build an artillery range.\n\nA similar situation occurred in the U.S. when [[NASA]] acquired land to construct the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]] (SSC), a rocket testing facility in [[Hancock County, Mississippi]] (on the Mississippi side of the [[Pearl River (Mississippi\u2013Louisiana)|Pearl River]], which is the [[Mississippi]]\u2013[[Louisiana]] state line). This required NASA to acquire a large (approximately {{convert|34|sqmi|adj=on}}) [[buffer zone]] because of the loud noise and potential dangers associated with testing such rockets. Five thinly populated rural Mississippi communities (Gainesville, Logtown, Napoleon, Santa Rosa, and Westonia), plus the northern portion of a sixth ([[Pearlington, Mississippi|Pearlington]]), along with 700 families in residence, had to be completely relocated away from the facility.\n\nSometimes the town might cease to officially exist, but the physical infrastructure remains. For example, the five Mississippi communities that had to be abandoned to build SSC still have remnants of those communities within the facility itself. These include city streets, now overgrown with forest flora and fauna, and a one-room schoolhouse. Another example of infrastructure remaining is the former town of [[Weston, DuPage County, Illinois|Weston, Illinois]], that voted itself out of existence and turned the land over for construction of the [[Fermilab|Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]]. Many houses and even a few barns remain, used for housing visiting scientists and storing maintenance equipment, while roads that used to cross through the site have been blocked off at the edges of the property, with gatehouses or barricades to prevent unsupervised access.\n\n====Flooding by dams====\nConstruction of dams has produced ghost towns that have been left underwater. Examples include the settlement of [[Loyston, Tennessee]], U.S., inundated by the creation of [[Norris Dam]]. The town was reorganised and reconstructed on nearby higher ground. Other examples are [[The Lost Villages]] of [[Ontario]] flooded by [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] construction in 1958, the hamlets of [[Nether Hambleton]] and [[Middle Hambleton]] in [[Rutland]], England, which were flooded to create [[Rutland Water]], and the villages of [[Ashopton]] and [[Derwent, Derbyshire|Derwent]], England, flooded during the construction of the [[Ladybower Reservoir]]. [[Mologa]] in Russia was flooded by the creation of [[Rybinsk reservoir]], and in France the [[Tignes Dam]] flooded the village of Tignes, displacing 78 families.{{Citation needed|reason=The wiki page for this dam does not mention and therefore does not cite the number of displaced families|date=June 2019}} Many ancient villages had to be abandoned during construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China, leading to the displacement of many rural people. In the Costa Rican province of Guanacaste, the town of [[Lake Arenal|Arenal]] was rebuilt to make room for the man-made [[Lake Arenal]]. The old town now lies submerged below the lake. [[Old Adaminaby]] was flooded by a dam of the [[Snowy River Scheme]]. Construction of the [[Aswan Dam|Aswan High Dam]] on the [[Nile River]] in Egypt submerged archaeological sites and ancient settlements such as [[Buhen]] under [[Lake Nasser]]. Another example of towns left underwater is [[Tehri]]; by the construction of the [[Tehri Dam]] in the Indian state of [[Uttarakhand]].\n\n====Massacres====\nSome towns become deserted when their populations are [[massacre]]d. The original French village at [[Oradour-sur-Glane]] was destroyed on [[Oradour-sur-Glane massacre|10 June 1944]] when 642 of its 663 inhabitants were killed by a German [[Waffen-SS]] company. A new village was built after the war on a nearby site, and the ruins of the original have been maintained as a memorial.\n\n===Disasters, actual and anticipated===\n[[File:Craco0001.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Craco]], Italy, was abandoned due to a landslide in 1963. Now it is a popular film set.]]\nNatural and man-made disasters can create ghost towns.

Two years after the last building in Lemieux was demolished, a landslide swept part of the former town-site into the [[South Nation River]]. Two decades earlier, the Canadian town of [[Saint-Jean-Vianney, Quebec|Saint-Jean-Vianney]], Qu\u00e9bec, also constructed on a Leda clay base, had been abandoned after a landslide on 4 May 1971, which swept away 41 homes, killing 31 people.\n\nFollowing the [[Chernobyl disaster]] of 1986, dangerously high levels of nuclear contamination escaped into the surrounding area, and nearly 200 towns and villages in [[Ukraine]] and neighbouring [[Belarus]] were evacuated, including the cities of [[Pripyat]] and [[Chernobyl]]. The area was so contaminated that many of the evacuees were never permitted to return to their homes.

It was destroyed during the [[1964 Rameswaram cyclone]] and remains uninhabited in the aftermath.\n\nMany abandoned towns and settlements in the former [[Soviet Union]] were established near [[Gulag]] concentration camps to supply necessary services. Since most of these camps were abandoned in the 1950s, the towns were abandoned as well. One such town is located near the former Gulag camp called [[Butugychag]] (also called Lower Butugychag). Other towns were deserted due to deindustrialisation and the economic crises of the early 1990s attributed to [[post-Soviet conflicts]] \u2013 one example being [[Tkvarcheli]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], a coal mining town that suffered a drastic population decline as a result of the [[War in Abkhazia (1992\u20131993)|War in Abkhazia]] in the early 1990s.\n\n===Antarctica===\n[[File:Deception-Base.jpg|thumb|The derelict British base in Whalers Bay, [[Deception Island]], destroyed by a volcanic eruption]]\nThe oldest ghost town in [[Antarctica]] is on [[Deception Island]], where in 1906, a Norwegian-Chilean company set up a whaling station at Whalers Bay, which they used as a base for their factory ship, the ''Gobernador Bories''. Other whaling operations followed suit, and by 1914 there were thirteen factory ships based there. The station ceased to be profitable during the [[Great Depression]], and was abandoned in 1931. In 1969, the station was partially destroyed by a volcanic eruption. There are also many abandoned scientific and military bases in Antarctica, especially in the [[Antarctic Peninsula]].\n\nThe Antarctic island of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] used to have several thriving whaling settlements during the first half of the 20th century, with a combined population exceeding 2,000 in some years. These included [[Grytviken]] (operating 1904\u201364), [[Leith Harbour]] (1909\u201365), [[Ocean Harbour]] (1909\u201320), [[Husvik]] (1910\u201360), [[Stromness (South Georgia)|Stromness]] (1912\u201361) and [[Prince Olav Harbour]] (1917\u201334). The abandoned settlements have become increasingly dilapidated, and remain uninhabited nowadays except for the Museum curator's family at Grytviken. The jetty, the church, dwellings and industrial buildings at Grytviken have recently been renovated by the South Georgian Government, becoming a popular tourist destination. Some historical buildings in the other settlements are being restored as well.\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Oradour-sur-Glane-Streets-1294.jpg|thumb|Main street of [[Oradour-sur-Glane]], France, unchanged since the German massacre.]]\n[[Urbanization]] \u2013 the migration of a country's rural population into the cities \u2013 has left many European towns and villages deserted.

The first village officially declared as \"dead\" was [[:hu:Gy\u0171r\u0171f\u0171|Gy\u0171r\u0171f\u0171]] in the late 1970s, but later it was repopulated as an eco-village. Some other depopulated villages were successfully saved as small rural resorts, such as [[K\u00e1n, Hungary|K\u00e1n]], [[Tornak\u00e1polna]], [[Szanticska]], [[Gorica, Hungary|Gorica]], and [[R\u00e9vfalu]].\n\nIn Spain, large zones of the mountainous [[Iberian System]] and the [[Pyrenees]] have undergone heavy depopulation since the early 20th century, leaving a string of ghost towns in areas such as the [[Solana Valley]]. Traditional agricultural practices such as sheep and goat rearing, on which the mountain village economy was based, were not taken over by the local youth, especially after the lifestyle changes that swept over rural Spain during the second half of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diariodeteruel.net/comarcas/30412-sos-mundo-rural-aragones-alerta-de-la-despoblacion-de-los-pueblos.html |title=Sos Mundo Rural Aragon\u00e9s alerta de la despoblaci\u00f3n de los pueblos |publisher=Diario de Teruel |language=Spanish |date=12 March 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315150215/http://www.diariodeteruel.net/comarcas/30412-sos-mundo-rural-aragones-alerta-de-la-despoblacion-de-los-pueblos.html |archive-date=15 March 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, thousands of villages were abandoned during the Middle Ages, as a result of [[Black Death]], climate change, revolts, and [[enclosure]], the process by which vast amounts of farmland became privately owned. Since there are rarely any visible remains of these settlements, they are not generally considered ghost towns; instead, they are referred to in archaeological circles as [[deserted medieval village]]s.\n\nSometimes, wars and genocide end a town's life. In 1944, occupying German Waffen-SS troops murdered almost the entire population of the French village [[Oradour-sur-Glane]]. A new settlement was built nearby after the war, but the old town was left depopulated on the orders of President [[Charles de Gaulle]], as a permanent memorial. In Germany, numerous smaller towns and villages in the [[former eastern territories of Germany|former eastern territories]] were completely destroyed in the last two years of the war. These territories later became part of [[Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and many of the smaller settlements were never rebuilt or repopulated, for example [[K\u0142omino]] (''Westfalenhof''), [[Pstr\u0105\u017ce]] (''Pstransse''), and [[Janowa G\u00f3ra]] (''Johannesberg''). Some villages in England were also abandoned during the war, but for different reasons. [[Imber]], on [[Salisbury Plain]], and  several villages in the [[Stanford Battle Area]], were commandeered by the [[War Office]] for use as training grounds for British and US troops. Although this was intended to be a temporary measure, the residents were never allowed to return, and the villages have been used for military training ever since. Three miles southeast of Imber is [[Copehill Down]], a deserted village purpose-built for training in [[urban warfare]].\n\nDisasters have played a part in the abandonment of settlements within Europe. After the [[Chernobyl disaster]] of 1986, the cities of [[Pripyat]] and [[Chernobyl]] were evacuated due to dangerous radiation levels within the area. As of today, Pripyat remains completely abandoned, and Chernobyl has around 500 remaining inhabitants.\n\n===North America===\n[[File:RobsartHospital.jpg|thumb|[[Robsart Hospital]], one of many abandoned buildings in [[Robsart, Saskatchewan]]]]\n\n====Canada====\n{{See also|Lists of ghost towns in Canada}}\nThere are ghost towns in parts of [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]], [[Ontario]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], and [[Quebec]]. Some were logging towns or dual mining and logging sites, often [[company town|developed at the behest of the company]]. In Alberta and Saskatchewan, most ghost towns were once farming communities that have since died off due to the removal of the railway through the town or the bypass of a highway. The ghost towns in British Columbia were predominantly mining towns and prospecting camps as well as canneries and, in one or two cases, large smelter and pulp mill towns. British Columbia has more ghost towns than any other jurisdiction on the North American continent, with one estimate at the number of abandoned and semi-abandoned towns and localities upwards of 1500.<ref>Ramsey, Bruce (1963\u20131975). ''Ghost Towns of British Columbia\". Vancouver: Mitchell Press.</ref> Among the most notable are [[Anyox]], [[Kitsault]], and [[Ocean Falls]].\n\nSome ghost towns have revived their economies and populations due to historical and eco-tourism, such as [[Barkerville, British Columbia|Barkerville]]. Barkerville, once the largest town north of [[Kamloops]], is now a year-round provincial museum. In Quebec, [[Val-Jalbert, Quebec|Val-Jalbert]] is a well-known tourist ghost town; founded in 1901 around a mechanical [[pulp mill]] that became obsolete when [[paper mill]]s began to break down [[wood fibre]] by chemical means, it was abandoned when the mill closed in 1927 and re-opened as a park in 1960.\n{{clear left}}\n\n====United States====\n{{See also|List of ghost towns in the United States}}\n[[File:A363, Rhyolite, Nevada, USA, John S Cook and Company building, 2004.jpg|thumb|Cook Bank building in [[Rhyolite, Nevada]], a gold mining town]]\nMany ghost towns or abandoned [[unincorporated area|communities]] exist in the American [[Great Plains]], the rural areas of which have lost a third of their population since 1920. Thousands of communities in the northern plains states of [[Montana]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]], and [[South Dakota]] became railroad ghost towns when a rail line failed to materialize. Hundreds of towns were abandoned when the [[Interstate highway system]] replaced the railroads as the favored mode of travel. Ghost towns are common in mining or [[mill town]]s in all the western states, and many eastern and southern states as well. Residents are compelled to leave in search of more productive areas when the resources that had created an employment boom in these towns were eventually consumed. Some unincorporated towns become ghost towns due to flooding caused by dam projects that created man{{endash}}made lakes, such as [[Oketeyeconne, Georgia|Oketeyeconne]].\n\nSometimes a ghost town consists of many abandoned buildings as in [[Bodie, California]], or standing ruins as in [[Rhyolite, Nevada]], while elsewhere only the foundations of former buildings remain as in [[Graysonia, Arkansas]].

The [[Zwaanendael Colony]] became a ghost town when every one of the colonists was massacred by Indians in 1632.

Many also settled in the growing small towns along the expanding railway system. Since the 1930s, many rural workers have moved to the big cities. Other ghost towns were created in the aftermath of dinosaur fossil rushes.\n\nA number of ghost towns throughout South America were once mining camps or lumber mills, such as the many [[sodium nitrate|saltpeter]] mining camps that prospered in Chile from the end of the [[War of the Pacific|Saltpeter War]] until the invention of synthetic saltpeter during World War I. Some of these towns, such as the [[Humberstone and Santa Laura Saltpeter Works]] in the [[Atacama Desert]], have been declared [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]s. Another former mining town, [[Real de Catorce]] in Mexico, has been used as a backdrop for Hollywood movies such as ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948), ''[[The Mexican]]'' (2001), and ''[[Bandidas]]'' (2006).\n\n===Oceania===\nThe boom and bust of gold rushes and the mining of other ores has led to a number of ghost towns in both Australia and New Zealand. Other towns have become abandoned whether due to natural disasters, the weather, or the drowning of valleys to increase the size of lakes.\n\nIn Australia, the [[Victoria gold rush]] led to numerous ghost towns (such as [[Cassilis, Victoria|Cassilis]] and [[Moliagul]]), as did the hunt for gold in [[Western Australia]] (for example, the towns of [[Ora Banda]] and [[Kanowna, Western Australia|Kanowna]]). The mining of iron and other ores has also led to towns thriving briefly before dwindling. \n\nIn New Zealand, the [[Otago gold rush]] similarly led to several ghost towns (such as [[Macetown]]). New Zealand's ghost towns also include numerous coal mining areas in the South Island's [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast Region]], including [[Denniston, New Zealand|Denniston]] and [[Stockton, New Zealand|Stockton]]. Natural disasters have also led to the loss of some towns, notably [[Te Wairoa (village)|Te Wairoa]], \"The Buried Village\", destroyed in the [[1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera]], and the Otago town of [[Kelso, New Zealand|Kelso]], abandoned after it was flooded repeatedly after heavy rainstorms. Early settlements on the rugged southwest coast of the South Island at [[Martins Bay]] and [[Port Craig]] were also abandoned, mainly due to the inhospitable terrain.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Abandoned mine#Abandoned mines|Abandoned mine]]\n*[[Abandoned village]]\n*[[Exclusion zone]]\n*[[List of ghost towns by country]]\n*[[Modern ruins]]\n*[[Old field (ecology)]]\n*[[Phantom settlement]]\n*[[Unused highway]]\n*[[Urban decay]]\n*[[Urban exploration]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n<!-- This section holds references that are cited by this article -->\n*{{cite book|last=Baker|first=T.

A town often becomes a ghost town because the economic activity that supported it (usually industrial or agricultural) has failed, or due to natural or human-caused disasters such as [[floods]], prolonged [[drought]]s, government actions, uncontrolled [[lawlessness]], [[war]], [[pollution]], or [[Nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents|nuclear disasters]]. The term can sometimes refer to cities, towns, and neighbourhoods that are still populated, but significantly less so than in past years; for example, those affected by high levels of unemployment and dereliction.<ref name=Baker/>\n\nSome ghost towns, especially those that preserve period-specific architecture, have become tourist attractions. Some examples are [[Bannack, Montana|Bannack]] in the United States, [[Barkerville, British Columbia|Barkerville]] in Canada, [[Craco]] in Italy, [[Kolmanskop]] in Namibia, [[Pripyat]] in Ukraine, and [[Danushkodi]] in India.\n\nThe town of [[Plymouth, Montserrat|Plymouth]] on the Caribbean island of [[Montserrat]] is a ghost town that is the ''[[de jure]]'' [[Capital city|capital]] of Montserrat. It was rendered uninhabitable by volcanic ash from an eruption of the [[Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano]].\n\n==Definition==\nThe definition of a ghost town varies between individuals, and between cultures. Some writers discount settlements that were abandoned as a result of a natural or human-made disaster or other causes using the term only to describe settlements that were deserted because they were no longer economically viable; T. Lindsey Baker, author of ''Ghost Towns of Texas'', defines a ghost town as \"a town for which the reason for being no longer exists\".<ref name=Baker>{{cite book |last=Baker |first= T.

American author Lambert Florin's defined a ghost town as \"a shadowy semblance of a former self\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Shawn|title=Ghost Towns and Mining Camps of Southern Nevada|year=2010|publisher=Arcadia Pub.|location=Charleston, SC|isbn=0738570125|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DHLCS4HNjuQC&pg=PA7}}</ref>\n\n==Reasons for abandonment==\nFactors leading to the abandonment of towns include depleted natural resources, economic activity shifting elsewhere, railroads and roads bypassing or no longer accessing the town, human intervention, disasters, massacres, wars, and the shifting of politics or fall of empires.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Graves |first1=Philip |last2=Weiler |first2=Stephan |last3=Tynon |first3=Emily |ssrn=1540770 |title=The Economics of Ghost Towns|publisher=Social Science Research Network |date=25 January 2010}}</ref> A town can also be abandoned when it is part of an [[exclusion zone]] due to [[Plymouth, Montserrat|natural]] or [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone|man-made causes]].\n\n===Economic activity shifting elsewhere===\n[[File:Abandoned farmhouse, overgrown.jpg|thumb|right|As farms [[Intensive farming|industrialize]], smaller farms are no longer economically viable, leading to rural decay.]]\n\nGhost towns may result when the single activity or resource that created a [[boomtown]] (e.g., nearby mine, mill or resort) is depleted or the resource economy undergoes a \"bust\" (e.g., catastrophic resource price collapse). Boomtowns can often decrease in size as fast as they initially grew. Sometimes, all or nearly the entire population can desert the town, resulting in a ghost town.\n\nThe dismantling of a boomtown can often occur on a planned basis. Mining companies nowadays will create a temporary community to service a mine site, building all the accommodation, shops and services required, and then remove them once the resource has been extracted. Modular buildings can be used to facilitate the process. A [[gold rush]] would often bring intensive but short-lived economic activity to a remote village, only to leave a ghost town once the resource was depleted.\n\nIn some cases, multiple factors may remove the economic basis for a community; some former [[mining town]]s on [[U.S. Route 66]] suffered both mine closures when the resources were depleted and loss of highway traffic as US 66 was diverted away from places like [[Oatman, Arizona]] onto a more direct path. Mine and pulp mill closures have led to many ghost towns in British Columbia, Canada including several relatively recent ones: [[Ocean Falls]] which closed in 1973 after the pulp mill was decommissioned, [[Kitsault]] B.C. whose molybdenum mine shut down after only 18 months in 1982, and [[Cassiar, British Columbia|Cassiar]] whose asbestos mine operated from 1952 to 1992.\n\nIn other cases, the reason for abandonment can arise from a town's intended economic function shifting to another, nearby place. This happened to [[Collingwood, Queensland]] in [[Outback]] [[Australia]] when nearby [[Winton, Queensland|Winton]] outperformed Collingwood as a regional centre for the livestock-raising industry. The railway reached Winton in 1899, linking it with the rest of [[Queensland]], and Collingwood was a ghost town by the following year.\n\nThe Middle East has many ghost towns that were created when the shifting of politics or the fall of empires caused capital cities to be socially or economically unviable, such as [[Ctesiphon]].\n\nThe rise of condominium investment and a resulting real estate bubble may also lead to a ghost town, as real estate prices rise and affordable housing becomes less available. Such examples include China and Canada, where housing is often used as an investment rather than for habitation.<!---What does that first clause mean?--->\n\n===Human intervention===\n[[File:Famagusta-Varosha 2007.JPG|thumb|Prior to the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974, [[Varosha, Famagusta|Varosha]], now falling into ruin, once was a modern tourist area.]]\n[[File:Akarmaraghosttown.jpg|thumb|[[Akarmara]], a [[mining town]] in [[Abkhazia]]/[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], was abandoned in the early 1990s due to the [[War in Abkhazia (1992\u201393)|War in Abkhazia]].]]\nRailroads and roads bypassing or no longer reaching a town can also create a ghost town. This was the case in many of the ghost towns along Ontario's historic [[Opeongo Line]], and along [[U.S. Route 66]] after motorists bypassed the latter on the faster moving highways [[Interstate 44|I-44]] and [[Interstate 40|I-40]]. Some ghost towns were founded along railways where [[steam train]]s would stop at periodic intervals to take on water. [[Amboy, California]] was part of one such series of villages along the [[Atlantic and Pacific Railroad]] across the [[Mojave Desert]].\n\nRiver re-routing is another factor, one example being the towns along the [[Aral Sea]].\n\nGhost towns may be created when land is [[eminent domain|expropriated]] by a government, and residents are required to relocate. One example is the village of [[Tyneham]] in [[Dorset]], England, acquired during World War II to build an artillery range.\n\nA similar situation occurred in the U.S. when [[NASA]] acquired land to construct the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]] (SSC), a rocket testing facility in [[Hancock County, Mississippi]] (on the Mississippi side of the [[Pearl River (Mississippi\u2013Louisiana)|Pearl River]], which is the [[Mississippi]]\u2013[[Louisiana]] state line). This required NASA to acquire a large (approximately {{convert|34|sqmi|adj=on}}) [[buffer zone]] because of the loud noise and potential dangers associated with testing such rockets. Five thinly populated rural Mississippi communities (Gainesville, Logtown, Napoleon, Santa Rosa, and Westonia), plus the northern portion of a sixth ([[Pearlington, Mississippi|Pearlington]]), along with 700 families in residence, had to be completely relocated away from the facility.\n\nSometimes the town might cease to officially exist, but the physical infrastructure remains. For example, the five Mississippi communities that had to be abandoned to build SSC still have remnants of those communities within the facility itself. These include city streets, now overgrown with forest flora and fauna, and a one-room schoolhouse. Another example of infrastructure remaining is the former town of [[Weston, DuPage County, Illinois|Weston, Illinois]], that voted itself out of existence and turned the land over for construction of the [[Fermilab|Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]]. Many houses and even a few barns remain, used for housing visiting scientists and storing maintenance equipment, while roads that used to cross through the site have been blocked off at the edges of the property, with gatehouses or barricades to prevent unsupervised access.\n\n====Flooding by dams====\nConstruction of dams has produced ghost towns that have been left underwater. Examples include the settlement of [[Loyston, Tennessee]], U.S., inundated by the creation of [[Norris Dam]]. The town was reorganised and reconstructed on nearby higher ground. Other examples are [[The Lost Villages]] of [[Ontario]] flooded by [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] construction in 1958, the hamlets of [[Nether Hambleton]] and [[Middle Hambleton]] in [[Rutland]], England, which were flooded to create [[Rutland Water]], and the villages of [[Ashopton]] and [[Derwent, Derbyshire|Derwent]], England, flooded during the construction of the [[Ladybower Reservoir]]. [[Mologa]] in Russia was flooded by the creation of [[Rybinsk reservoir]], and in France the [[Tignes Dam]] flooded the village of Tignes, displacing 78 families.{{Citation needed|reason=The wiki page for this dam does not mention and therefore does not cite the number of displaced families|date=June 2019}} Many ancient villages had to be abandoned during construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China, leading to the displacement of many rural people. In the Costa Rican province of Guanacaste, the town of [[Lake Arenal|Arenal]] was rebuilt to make room for the man-made [[Lake Arenal]]. The old town now lies submerged below the lake. [[Old Adaminaby]] was flooded by a dam of the [[Snowy River Scheme]]. Construction of the [[Aswan Dam|Aswan High Dam]] on the [[Nile River]] in Egypt submerged archaeological sites and ancient settlements such as [[Buhen]] under [[Lake Nasser]]. Another example of towns left underwater is [[Tehri]]; by the construction of the [[Tehri Dam]] in the Indian state of [[Uttarakhand]].\n\n====Massacres====\nSome towns become deserted when their populations are [[massacre]]d. The original French village at [[Oradour-sur-Glane]] was destroyed on [[Oradour-sur-Glane massacre|10 June 1944]] when 642 of its 663 inhabitants were killed by a German [[Waffen-SS]] company. A new village was built after the war on a nearby site, and the ruins of the original have been maintained as a memorial.\n\n===Disasters, actual and anticipated===\n[[File:Craco0001.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Craco]], Italy, was abandoned due to a landslide in 1963. Now it is a popular film set.]]\nNatural and man-made disasters can create ghost towns. For example, after being flooded more than 30 times since their town was founded in 1845, residents of [[Pattonsburg, Missouri]], decided to relocate after two floods in 1993. With government help, the whole town was rebuilt {{convert|3|mi}} away.\n\n[[Craco]], a medieval village in the Italian region of [[Basilicata]], was evacuated after a landslide in 1963. Nowadays it is a famous filming location for many movies, including ''[[The Passion of The Christ]]'' by [[Mel Gibson]], ''[[Christ Stopped at Eboli (film)|Christ Stopped at Eboli]]'' by [[Francesco Rosi]], ''[[The Nativity Story]]'' by [[Catherine Hardwicke]] and ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'' by [[Marc Forster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/search/title?locations=Craco,%20Matera,%20Basilicata,%20Italy&ref_=ttloc_loc_14|title=Most Popular Titles With Location Matching \"Craco, Matera, Basilicata, Italy\"|website=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=15 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984, [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]] was abandoned due to an uncontainable [[mine fire]], which began in 1962 and still rages to this day; eventually the fire reached an abandoned mine underneath the nearby town of [[Byrnesville, Pennsylvania]], which caused that mine to catch on fire too and forced the evacuation of that town as well.\n\n[[File:Pripyat-today.jpg|thumb|[[Prypiat|Pripyat]], Ukraine, was abandoned after the [[Chernobyl disaster]].]]\nGhost towns may also occasionally come into being due to an ''anticipated'' natural disaster \u2013 for example, the Canadian town of [[Lemieux, Ontario]] was abandoned in 1991 after soil testing revealed that the community was built on an unstable bed of [[Leda clay]]. Two years after the last building in Lemieux was demolished, a landslide swept part of the former town-site into the [[South Nation River]]. Two decades earlier, the Canadian town of [[Saint-Jean-Vianney, Quebec|Saint-Jean-Vianney]], Qu\u00e9bec, also constructed on a Leda clay base, had been abandoned after a landslide on 4 May 1971, which swept away 41 homes, killing 31 people.\n\nFollowing the [[Chernobyl disaster]] of 1986, dangerously high levels of nuclear contamination escaped into the surrounding area, and nearly 200 towns and villages in [[Ukraine]] and neighbouring [[Belarus]] were evacuated, including the cities of [[Pripyat]] and [[Chernobyl]]. The area was so contaminated that many of the evacuees were never permitted to return to their homes. Pripyat is the most famous of these abandoned towns; it was built for the workers of the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] and had a population of almost 50,000 at the time of the disaster.<ref name=chernobyl>{{cite book|last=Mould|first=R.

Some notable examples are [[Times Beach, Missouri]], whose residents were exposed to a high level of [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]], and [[Wittenoom, Western Australia|Wittenoom]], [[Western Australia]], which was once Australia's largest source of [[blue asbestos]], but was shut down in 1966 due to health concerns. [[Treece, Kansas|Treece]] and [[Picher, Oklahoma|Picher]], twin communities straddling the [[Kansas]]\u2013[[Oklahoma]] border, were once one of the United States' largest sources of [[zinc]] and [[lead]], but over a century of unregulated disposal of [[mine tailings]] led to groundwater contamination and lead poisoning in the town's children, eventually resulting in a mandatory [[Environmental Protection Agency]] buyout and evacuation. Contamination due to [[ammunition]] caused by military use may also lead to the development of ghost towns. [[Tyneham]], in [[Dorset]], was requisitioned for military exercises during the [[Second World War]], and remains unpopulated, being littered with unexploded munitions from regular shelling.\n\n==Revived ghost towns==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 200\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Walhalla 1910 view4.jpg\n| width1    = \n| alt1      = Walhalla township in 1910\n| caption1  = Walhalla township in 1910\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = WalhallaVicCorner.jpg\n| width2    = \n| alt2      = Walhalla township in 2004\n| caption2  = Part of Walhalla in 2004, showing a mix of original and reconstructed buildings\n<!-- Extra parameters -->\n| header            = \n| header_align      = <!-- left/right/center -->\n| header_background = \n| footer            = [[Walhalla, Victoria]] was almost abandoned after being mined for gold, but is now becoming repopulated.\n| footer_align      = left\n| footer_background = \n| background color  = \n}}\n\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2012}}\n\nA few ghost towns get a second life, often due to [[heritage tourism]] generating a new economy able to support residents.

Since most of these camps were abandoned in the 1950s, the towns were abandoned as well. One such town is located near the former Gulag camp called [[Butugychag]] (also called Lower Butugychag). Other towns were deserted due to deindustrialisation and the economic crises of the early 1990s attributed to [[post-Soviet conflicts]] \u2013 one example being [[Tkvarcheli]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], a coal mining town that suffered a drastic population decline as a result of the [[War in Abkhazia (1992\u20131993)|War in Abkhazia]] in the early 1990s.\n\n===Antarctica===\n[[File:Deception-Base.jpg|thumb|The derelict British base in Whalers Bay, [[Deception Island]], destroyed by a volcanic eruption]]\nThe oldest ghost town in [[Antarctica]] is on [[Deception Island]], where in 1906, a Norwegian-Chilean company set up a whaling station at Whalers Bay, which they used as a base for their factory ship, the ''Gobernador Bories''. Other whaling operations followed suit, and by 1914 there were thirteen factory ships based there. The station ceased to be profitable during the [[Great Depression]], and was abandoned in 1931. In 1969, the station was partially destroyed by a volcanic eruption. There are also many abandoned scientific and military bases in Antarctica, especially in the [[Antarctic Peninsula]].\n\nThe Antarctic island of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] used to have several thriving whaling settlements during the first half of the 20th century, with a combined population exceeding 2,000 in some years. These included [[Grytviken]] (operating 1904-64), [[Leith Harbour]] (1909\u201365), [[Ocean Harbour]] (1909\u201320), [[Husvik]] (1910\u201360), [[Stromness (South Georgia)|Stromness]] (1912\u201361) and [[Prince Olav Harbour]] (1917\u201334). The abandoned settlements have become increasingly dilapidated, and remain uninhabited nowadays except for the Museum curator's family at Grytviken. The jetty, the church, dwellings and industrial buildings at Grytviken have recently been renovated by the South Georgian Government, becoming a popular tourist destination. Some historical buildings in the other settlements are being restored as well.\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Oradour-sur-Glane-Streets-1294.jpg|thumb|Main street of [[Oradour-sur-Glane]], France, unchanged since the German massacre.]]\n[[Urbanization]] \u2013 the migration of a country's rural population into the cities \u2013 has left many European towns and villages deserted. An increasing number of settlements in Bulgaria are becoming ghost towns for this reason; at the time of the 2011 census, the country had 181 uninhabited settlements.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sofiaecho.com/2011/07/21/1126999_bulgarias-population-is-73-million-official-2011-census-results |title=Bulgaria's population is 7.3 million - official 2011 census results |newspaper=The Sofia Echo |date=21 July 2011 |accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref> In Hungary, dozens of villages are also threatened with abandonment. The first village officially declared as \"dead\" was [[:hu:Gy\u0171r\u0171f\u0171|Gy\u0171r\u0171f\u0171]] in the late 1970s, but later it was repopulated as an eco-village. Some other depopulated villages were successfully saved as small rural resorts, such as [[K\u00e1n, Hungary|K\u00e1n]], [[Tornak\u00e1polna]], [[Szanticska]], [[Gorica, Hungary|Gorica]], and [[R\u00e9vfalu]].\n\nIn Spain, large zones of the mountainous [[Iberian System]] and the [[Pyrenees]] have undergone heavy depopulation since the early 20th century, leaving a string of ghost towns in areas such as the [[Solana Valley]]. Traditional agricultural practices such as sheep and goat rearing, on which the mountain village economy was based, were not taken over by the local youth, especially after the lifestyle changes that swept over rural Spain during the second half of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diariodeteruel.net/comarcas/30412-sos-mundo-rural-aragones-alerta-de-la-despoblacion-de-los-pueblos.html |title=Sos Mundo Rural Aragon\u00e9s alerta de la despoblaci\u00f3n de los pueblos |publisher=Diario de Teruel |language=Spanish |date=12 March 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315150215/http://www.diariodeteruel.net/comarcas/30412-sos-mundo-rural-aragones-alerta-de-la-despoblacion-de-los-pueblos.html |archive-date=15 March 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, thousands of villages were abandoned during the Middle Ages, as a result of [[Black Death]], climate change, revolts, and [[enclosure]], the process by which vast amounts of farmland became privately owned. Since there are rarely any visible remains of these settlements, they are not generally considered ghost towns; instead, they are referred to in archaeological circles as [[deserted medieval village]]s.\n\nSometimes, wars and genocide end a town's life. In 1944, occupying German Waffen-SS troops murdered almost the entire population of the French village [[Oradour-sur-Glane]]. A new settlement was built nearby after the war, but the old town was left depopulated on the orders of President [[Charles de Gaulle]], as a permanent memorial. In Germany, numerous smaller towns and villages in the [[former eastern territories of Germany|former eastern territories]] were completely destroyed in the last two years of the war. These territories later became part of [[Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and many of the smaller settlements were never rebuilt or repopulated, for example [[K\u0142omino]] (''Westfalenhof''), [[Pstr\u0105\u017ce]] (''Pstransse''), and [[Janowa G\u00f3ra]] (''Johannesberg''). Some villages in England were also abandoned during the war, but for different reasons. [[Imber]], on [[Salisbury Plain]], and  several villages in the [[Stanford Battle Area]], were commandeered by the [[War Office]] for use as training grounds for British and US troops. Although this was intended to be a temporary measure, the residents were never allowed to return, and the villages have been used for military training ever since. Three miles southeast of Imber is [[Copehill Down]], a deserted village purpose-built for training in [[urban warfare]].\n\nDisasters have played a part in the abandonment of settlements within Europe. After the [[Chernobyl disaster]] of 1986, the cities of [[Pripyat]] and [[Chernobyl]] were evacuated due to dangerous radiation levels within the area. As of today, Pripyat remains completely abandoned, and Chernobyl has around 500 remaining inhabitants.\n\n===North America===\n[[File:RobsartHospital.jpg|thumb|[[Robsart Hospital]], one of many abandoned buildings in [[Robsart, Saskatchewan]]]]\n\n====Canada====\n{{See also|Lists of ghost towns in Canada}}\nThere are ghost towns in parts of [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]], [[Ontario]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], and [[Quebec]]. Some were logging towns or dual mining and logging sites, often [[company town|developed at the behest of the company]]. In Alberta and Saskatchewan, most ghost towns were once farming communities that have since died off due to the removal of the railway through the town or the bypass of a highway. The ghost towns in British Columbia were predominantly mining towns and prospecting camps as well as canneries and, in one or two cases, large smelter and pulp mill towns. British Columbia has more ghost towns than any other jurisdiction on the North American continent, with one estimate at the number of abandoned and semi-abandoned towns and localities upwards of 1500.<ref>Ramsey, Bruce (1963-1975). ''Ghost Towns of British Columbia\". Vancouver: Mitchell Press.</ref> Among the most notable are [[Anyox]], [[Kitsault]], and [[Ocean Falls]].\n\nSome ghost towns have revived their economies and populations due to historical and eco-tourism, such as [[Barkerville, British Columbia|Barkerville]]. Barkerville, once the largest town north of [[Kamloops]], is now a year-round provincial museum. In Quebec, [[Val-Jalbert, Quebec|Val-Jalbert]] is a well-known tourist ghost town; founded in 1901 around a mechanical [[pulp mill]] that became obsolete when [[paper mill]]s began to break down [[wood fibre]] by chemical means, it was abandoned when the mill closed in 1927 and re-opened as a park in 1960.\n{{clear left}}\n\n====United States====\n{{See also|List of ghost towns in the United States}}\n[[File:A363, Rhyolite, Nevada, USA, John S Cook and Company building, 2004.jpg|thumb|Cook Bank building in [[Rhyolite, Nevada]], a gold mining town]]\nMany ghost towns or abandoned [[unincorporated area|communities]] exist in the American [[Great Plains]], the rural areas of which have lost a third of their population since 1920. Thousands of communities in the northern plains states of [[Montana]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]], and [[South Dakota]] became railroad ghost towns when a rail line failed to materialize. Hundreds of towns were abandoned when the [[Interstate highway system]] replaced the railroads as the favored mode of travel. Ghost towns are common in mining or [[mill town]]s in all the western states, and many eastern and southern states as well. Residents are compelled to leave in search of more productive areas when the resources that had created an employment boom in these towns were eventually consumed. Some unincorporated towns become ghost towns due to flooding caused by dam projects that created man{{endash}}made lakes, such as [[Oketeyeconne, Georgia|Oketeyeconne]].\n\nSometimes a ghost town consists of many abandoned buildings as in [[Bodie, California]], or standing ruins as in [[Rhyolite, Nevada]], while elsewhere only the foundations of former buildings remain as in [[Graysonia, Arkansas]]. Old mining camps that have lost most of their population at some stage of their history such as [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], [[Oatman, Arizona|Oatman]], [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]] and [[Virginia City, Montana|Virginia City]] are sometimes referred to as ghost towns although they are presently active towns and cities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Many U.S. ghost towns, such as [[South Pass City, Wyoming|South Pass City in Wyoming]]<ref>Weis, Norman D.

In 1590, mapmaker [[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] arrived at the [[Roanoke Colony]], North Carolina to find it deserted, its inhabitants having vanished without a trace. The [[Zwaanendael Colony]] became a ghost town when every one of the colonists was massacred by Indians in 1632. [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], the first permanent English settlement in the Americas, was abandoned when [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] became the new capital of the colony in 1699. <!-- Consider removing this paragraph, off topic -->\n\nStarting in 2002, an attempt to declare an official ghost town in California stalled when the adherents of the town of [[Bodie, California|Bodie]] and those of [[Calico, San Bernardino County, California|Calico]], in [[Southern California]], could not agree on the most deserving settlement for the recognition. A compromise was eventually reached\u2013Bodie became the official state [[gold rush]] ghost town, while Calico was named the official state [[silver rush]] ghost town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netstate.com/states/symb/towns/ca_gold_rush_ghost_town.htm |title=California State Gold Rush Ghost Town |publisher=NetState |accessdate=28 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n===South America===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a wave of European immigrants arrived in Brazil and settled in the cities, which offered jobs, education, and other opportunities that enabled newcomers to enter the middle class. Many also settled in the growing small towns along the expanding railway system. Since the 1930s, many rural workers have moved to the big cities. Other ghost towns were created in the aftermath of dinosaur fossil rushes.\n\nA number of ghost towns throughout South America were once mining camps or lumber mills, such as the many [[sodium nitrate|saltpeter]] mining camps that prospered in Chile from the end of the [[War of the Pacific|Saltpeter War]] until the invention of synthetic saltpeter during World War I. Some of these towns, such as the [[Humberstone and Santa Laura Saltpeter Works]] in the [[Atacama Desert]], have been declared [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]s. Another former mining town, [[Real de Catorce]] in Mexico, has been used as a backdrop for Hollywood movies such as ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948), ''[[The Mexican]]'' (2001), and ''[[Bandidas]]'' (2006).\n\n===Oceania===\nThe boom and bust of gold rushes and the mining of other ores has led to a number of ghost towns in both Australia and New Zealand. Other towns have become abandoned whether due to natural disasters, the weather, or the drowning of valleys to increase the size of lakes.\n\nIn Australia, the [[Victoria gold rush]] led to numerous ghost towns (such as [[Cassilis, Victoria|Cassilis]] and [[Moliagul]]), as did the hunt for gold in [[Western Australia]] (for example, the towns of [[Ora Banda]] and [[Kanowna, Western Australia|Kanowna]]). The mining of iron and other ores has also led to towns thriving briefly before dwindling. \n\nIn New Zealand, the [[Otago gold rush]] similarly led to several ghost towns (such as [[Macetown]]). New Zealand's ghost towns also include numerous coal mining areas in the South Island's [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast Region]], including [[Denniston, New Zealand|Denniston]] and [[Stockton, New Zealand|Stockton]]. Natural disasters have also led to the loss of some towns, notably [[Te Wairoa (village)|Te Wairoa]], \"The Buried Village\", destroyed in the [[1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera]], and the Otago town of [[Kelso, New Zealand|Kelso]], abandoned after it was flooded repeatedly after heavy rainstorms. Early settlements on the rugged southwest coast of the South Island at [[Martins Bay]] and [[Port Craig]] were also abandoned, mainly due to the inhospitable terrain.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Abandoned mine#Abandoned mines|Abandoned mine]]\n*[[Abandoned village]]\n*[[Exclusion zone]]\n*[[List of ghost towns by country]]\n*[[Modern ruins]]\n*[[Old field (ecology)]]\n*[[Phantom settlement]]\n*[[Unused highway]]\n*[[Urban decay]]\n*[[Urban exploration]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n<!-- This section holds references that are cited by this article -->\n*{{cite book|last=Baker|first=T.

This town is located at the edge of the Zambales mountain ranges, West of Mabini, South of Agno, North of Dasol and East of the China Sea. About 65 kilometers away from the capital town of Lingayen.\n\nBurgos was founded as an independent town in 1830 by the early Ilocanos from [[Paoay|Paoay, Ilocos Norte]] headed by Don Matias Guiang. The provincial government of [[Zambales]] has not ignored the ever increasing population and as it saw the necessity of a government to oversee the village. Don Matias Guiang made history, as quoted from the Philippine Archives, when on May 15, 1830 the Spanish Governor of [[Zambales]] issued a decree creating his settlement into a \"pueblo\" and appointed him as the first [[gobernadorcillo]] and was first named San Isidro in honor of its Patron Saint. Since there was another locality named San Isidro along the Lingayen Gulf, the residents later decided to add \"Potot\" derived from the description of the Amburayan River which appeared to be cut or \"potot\". Confusion however continued and persisted as mails for San Isidro de Potot were missent to the town of [[Labrador, Pangasinan|Labrador]] and those of the latter to the former town to finally solved the confusion and was finally renamed Burgos, after the Filipino Martyr priest who was executed during the Spanish regime. The renaming of the town was done in 1913 during the administration of Don Anacleto Ruiz.\n\nThe town of Burgos was ceded to the Province of Pangasinan, by virtue of Republic Act No. 1004 dated November 30, 1903 of the Philippine Commission. There also holds the westernmost point in Luzon.<br />\n[[File:Burgos, Pangasinan Welcome Sign.jpg|thumb|right|Welcome signage]]\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0797 24.JPG|thumb|right|Burgos Town Hall]]\n\n==Etymology==    \n\nBurgos, so-called today, this being the present official name, was known before as\u00a0San Isidro\u00a0during the Spanish time and was then within the geographical jurisdiction of the province of [[Zambales]].\n\nHow this place got its name is not definitely known. Judging from the fact that there were no accounts left circulating in the lips of the old people today as to how is got its name. \n\nThe early immigrants were God-fearing people. The have come to this place, lured by its vast agri-cultural possibilities. They were charmed by the rolling hills and the nice valleys cut-ting the plain. They envisioned that this is an ideal place that would give them ease, peace and comfort in their later life. When the early settlers migrated, to this place, they brought with them their religious beliefs. They worshipped fervently, revered highly [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore the Laborer]]\u00a0and pinned their fates and hopes of bountiful harvest upon the blessings of the Saint.\n\nAfter some years the settlers have increased their tribe and number and then came necessity of organizing their settlement into a public with Don Matias Guiang, who was then the most prosperous land owner of the place and the most influential personage to the settler, as the first\u00a0\"'''[[Gobernadorcillo]]'''\"\u00a0of the town. '''San Isidro''' was its incorporated name in honor of\u00a0St. Isidore the Laborer, whom the settlers have adopted, loved and revered as their Patron Saint. \n\nDuring the Spanish period and the early part of the American era, Burgos, Dasol and Mabini was a part of a settlement as one municipality known as San Isidro de Potot. Burgos may have been the last place to be found in the settlement but even though it still became the settlement's capital due to its fast-growing economy that it was declared an independent town upon its founding. The term \"'''Potot'''\" appended to the name San Isidro in an Ilocano adjective meaning \"'''clipped'''\", \"'''cut-off'''\" or disconnected. Not far from poblacion there is a brook or stream which during dry common ages has not continuous water. This stream, therefore, is discontinued and disconnected during summer months and to those now-comers in the place, this condition of the stream served as identification of the location of the town.\n\nThere were being then two municipalities in Pangasinan with the name of San Isidro Labrador and Potot, But the term \"'''Potot'''\" identified it well more from the other.\n\n===Folktale===\n\nThe Locals unveils the tale of how the town may have got its first name.\n\nLong ago when there were only few people living in the area where now the town of Burgos located, there were hunters who were hunting for wild animals. When these hunters got tired and thirsty, they looked for water to drink. As they were walking, they saw a man with a beard carrying a long cane. The hunters inquired from the man where they may be able to get water. The man drove his cane through the ground and suddenly water came flowing. Much to their surprise, the hunters remained silent for a moment. The man carrying a long cane was believed to be the patron saint, of the town, [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore the Laborer]]. From that time up to the present we can still see the spring with its made wall, which is also the source of water supply of some folks of the town.\n\n===Renaming===\nIn 1913, as mayor, Don Anacleto Ruiz, the name of the town was changed to\u00a0Burgos, in memory of one of the greatest Filipino martyrs, Padre [[Jos\u00e9 Burgos|Jos\u00e9 Apolonio Burgos]], who together with Padre Gomez and Zamora were mercilessly executed in the field of Bagumbayan on February 17, 1872. Padre Burgos, a very influential and able man was an [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]], he being a native of [[Vigan|Vigan, Ilocos Sur]]. He was highly praised in the real of priesthood and was very much loved by his people but more so by the Ilocanos. Before his death, he was a great reformer, his execution was deeply resented and mourned for the people believed in his innocence. To perpetuate his memory, the authorities changed the name of this town from '''San Isidro''' to '''Burgos''' in a grateful remembrance of this overwhelming love and admiration of the people for priesthood, as a profession.\n\n==History==\nIn the first part of the 19th century, '''Mat\u00edas Guiang''', a powerful sailor from [[Paoay|Paoay, Ilocos Norte]] regularly traveled the China Sea between the [[Ilocos Region|Ilocos]] and [[Zambales]] region for commercial purposes. He decided to emigrate with his neighbors, family and friends to Zambales del Norte, now the western part of the province of Pangasinan. They disembarked at the mouth of the [[Agno River]] by tracing it.\n\n===Philippine Revolution===\nIn the late 19th century in San Isidro de Potot, [[Zambales]] (now,'''\u00a0Burgos''', '''Pangasinan'''). The municipal Gobernadorcillo was Don Tomas Braga, and the parish priest of the town before the revolution was a native of\u00a0[[Barcelona|Barcelona, Spain]], and his name was Mariano Torrente.\n\nThe town was a prosperous community of farming and ranching. But the atmosphere was already seething with dissidence; winds of rebellion disturb the people.\n\nTwenty Spanish \"'''Cazadores'''\" had their cuartel or barracks in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. Cazadores literally means \"'''hunters'''\" their aim was to hunt the Filipino outlaws or dissidents.\n\nAcross the plaza from the cuartel was the big convent which stood at the same place where now stands the small convent. This convent was made out of adobe stones, 24 meters long and 12 meters wide; It was two stories high.\n\nAcross the plaza from the convent was the \"'''tribunal'''\" or municipal hall where now stands the present municipal hall building. This tribunal was made out of adobe stones. It was ten meters high.\n\nA tower was being constructed at the town plaza between the convent and the tribunal. This tower or fort was made of stones, 5 meters square inside dimensions, 3 stories high, and its walls are 1/2 meter thick.\n\nInsurgency was becoming widespread; the measures adopted by the Spaniards increased the number of outlaws. In Northern Zambales, which is now Western, Pangasinan, the soprano of the surgent was Ramon Manalang whose headquarters was in a hideout somewhere in Alaminos, Zambales (now '''[[Pangasinan]]''').\n\nIn San Isidro (now '''Burgos'''), the captain of the outlaws was Juanso Viado. The outlaws or dissidents were very numerous, had very few defective guns, and mostly armed with crude sabers, sharp spears and long bolos.\n\nIt was in February 1898. The outlaws attacked the cuartel of the Cazadores in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. The attackers greatly outnumbered the Cazadores. The Cazadores, armed with mauzzers, were poor shooters; while the Filipino outlaws, currently armed, were nomatoli for the well-armed Cazadores.\n\nThe twenty Spanish Cazadores managed to escape to the convent across the plaza. The Filipino attackers laid a siege to them.\n\nOne day, about mealtime, when the Filipino besiegers slackened their vigilance, the Cazadores were able to escape to the tower at the middle of the plaza. Already the cuartel was occupied by the outlaws.\n\nFor two nights and three days, the Cazadores stayed in the tower or fort without food. The people of the town including the municipal gobernadorcillo gone to distant the place.\n\nBut Padre Mariano Torrente reminded, being a peaceful man, and maintaining maturity in the fight, he acted as the lissome between the Spanish Cazadores and the Filipino outlaws.\n\nCaptain Juanso Viado of the outlaws told Padre Mariano Torrente that the cazadores should better surrender, or they would die of hunger. The priest was able to prevail upon the Spaniards to low down their arms.\n\nOn the third afternoon, the Spanish Cazadores threw their guns out of the windows of the tower in token of surrender. The Filipino outlaws took the guns, then the Cazadores went out of the tower, and the Filipino outlaws and Spanish Cazadores shook hands and embraced each other as good friends.\n\nBut such good friendship was short-lived. A fatal coincidence happened which turned the friendship into tragedy.\n\nThe morning following the surrender, news reached San Isidro that a big Spanish troop heavily armed arrived in Alaminos, Zambales (now '''[[Pangasinan]]''') on their way to San Isidro. This news alarmed the outlaws who reacted immediately seizing the Cazadores and taking them as prisoners. For the gladdened Cazadores naturally; the Spanish troop was being sent to save all Spaniards.\n\nThe Spanish Cazadores including Padre Mariano Torrente and also Padre Juan Naves of Dasol, were taken to the forest of Alimpayukan between San Isidro and Balincaguin (now'''\u00a0[[Mabini, Pangasinan]]'''). The Spaniards, upon being assured of their safety, and that no harm would happen, went willingly.\n\nUpon arriving at the forest, Alimpayukan, 20 Spanish Cazadores and 2 Spanish priests were blindfolded and their heads out-off. For the Spanish troop is about to arrive, and the Spaniards might escape to join them.\n\nShortly after the Spaniards were murdered, the big Spanish troop arrived in San Isidro and encircled the town. There were 20 uniformed Filipino outlaws or insurgents who were to form a local government. These were caught, taken to Mt. Polipol just a few kilometers east from the town, and were shot in a single file.\n\nAt that time, there was known as \"'''Juez de Cuchillo'''\", which means that if a priest was murdered in a town, the said town, being listed to\u00a0Juez de Cuchillo,\u00a0shall have its people killed and even their houses destroyed.\n\nIn San Isidro, no people could be seen for they had evacuated, and only the twenty Filipino insurgents were seen and caught and killed. The Spanish troop burned down the big houses that are owned by the richest and the most influential personage of the town.\n\nThe big Spanish troop left San Isidro, and then proceeded to [[Dasol]], in this place they killed the \"[[Principal\u00eda|'''principal\u00edas''']]\" and \"'''captains'''\", that is, the rich and the influential, and also burned their big houses. Because the Spanish priest of Dasol, Padre Juan Naves was beheaded in the forest of Alimpayukan; and many of the insurgents were from Dasol for the body of outlaws, headed by captain Juanso Viado, came from many places.\n\nThe big Spanish troop left [[Dasol]] empty-handed, a lot of people were killed including the rich and influential, so was their big houses were also burned down and left into ashes.\n\nThe Spanish detachments in the northern towns of Zambales was defeated and around 50 Spanish Friars were annihilated. These were the parish priests of [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]], [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], [[Bani, Pangasinan|Bani]], [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Balincaguin]], [[Dasol]] and San Isidro de Potot.\n\nNothing more was heard of the Spanish troop. Perhaps they were secured or perhaps imprisoned by the outlaws.\n\n===American Occupation===\nThe Katipunan Government was functioning smoothly, at least in San Isidro. In November 1900, Gen. Miguel and Don Miguel and Don Mauro Ortis came to recruit volunteers to meet the Americans in\u00a0[[Mangatarem]]. The volunteers went to Mangatarem, but poorly armed, had to retreat before the heavy American arms and cobranded. Nicolas Guiang, who was among those recruited, back across the mountains to Mt. Pita, then went to Infanta, and then back to San Isidro.\n\nThe Americans moved swiftly. They occupied San Isidro by December 1900 and established peace and order. They came with their wives. The costumes of the American women had decided influences in changing the Filipino costumes from oriental to occidental.\n\nThe Americans established a policy of attraction and launched it literally. They gave clothes, freely goods and tolerated the local customs.\n\nIn 1901 a severe storm hit San Isidro. The big convent was wrecked. So was the municipal building. The town church managed to survive and some of the original structures of the church still stands in some years, but It faced several renovations through the years due to avoid collapsing possibilities.\n\nIn 1903, the northern part of Zambales was annexed to the Province of Pangasinan. The municipalities ceded were [[Alaminos, Pangasinan|Alaminos]], [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]], [[Bani, Pangasinan|Bani]],\u00a0[[Agno, Pangasinan|Agno]], [[Infanta, Pangasinan|Infanta]] and San Isidro de Potot (Burgos, [[Dasol]], and [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Mabini]]). Townsfolk cited alleged lack of concern for the town's interest and welfare by the Zambales provincial government therefore they were incorporated to Pangasinan.\n\nShortly after, the towns of Northern Zambales were incorporated in Pangasinan. [[Dasol]] and [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Balincaguin]] seceded from San Isidro de Potot,  Balincaguin was renamed as Mabini (in honor of\u00a0'''[[Apolinario Mabini]]'''). San Isidro de Potot was changed to Burgos (in honor of Padre '''[[Jos\u00e9 Burgos]]'''), and in order not to confuse it to\u00a0[[Labrador, Pangasinan|San Isidro Labrador de Tobuang]] of Pangasinan.\n\n==List of Municipal Heads==\n\nThe name of persons who held a leading official position during the Spanish period and thereafter were the following.\n\n\n[[Gobernadorcillo]]:\n\n*Don Matias Guiang (1830)\n*\n\n*Don Pascual Bonostro (1831)\n*\n\n*Don Diego Bustamante (1832)\n*\n*Don Fernando Bonilla (1833)\n*\n*Don Paulo Padua (1834)\n*\n*Don Matias Guiang (1835)\n*\n*Don Juan Discoloso (1836)\n*\n*Don Juan Bonostro (1837)\n*\n*Don Agustin Cuaresma (1838)\n*\n*Don Pascual de Guzman (1839)\n*\n*Don Paulo Doctor (1840)\n*\n*Don Pedro Guiang (1841)\n*\n*Don Vicente Bondal (1842)\n*\n*Don Miguel Cuaresma (1843)\n*\n*Don Ramon Bustria (1844)\n*\n*Don Exequel Ugto (1845)\n*\n*Don Agapito Tolentino Braga (1846)\n*\n*Don Domingo Valdez (1847)\n*\n*Don Tomas Guiang (1848)\n*\n*Don Jose de Leon (1849)\n*\n*Don Juan Bonilla (1850)\n*\n*Don Henenio Doctor (1851)\n*\n*Don Raymundo Bonostro (1852)\n*\n*Don Romualdo Braga (1853)\n*\n*Don Melchor Ruiz (1854)\n*\n*Don Paulino Bustamante (1855)\n*\n*Don Feliciano de Guzman (1856)\n*\n*Don Eldefonzo Bona (1857)\n*\n*Don Cornelio Valdez (1858)\n*\n*Don Agapito Ugto (1859)\n*\n*Don Martin Gallardo (1860)\n*\n*Don Mariano Mendoza (1861)\n*\n*Don Anborcio Guiang (1862)\n*\n*Don Santiago Ruiz (1863)\n*\n*Don Santiago Ruiz (1864)\n*\n*Don Justo Bonada (1865)\n*\n*Don Victorio Braga (1867)\n*\n*Don Mauricio Gallardo (1869)\n*\n*Don Silvestro Ruiz (1871)\n*\n*Don Cornelio Braga (1873)\n*\n*Don Flaviano Cudal (1875)\n*\n*Don Francisco Guiang (1877)\n*\n*Don Lorenzo Bonando (1879)\n*\n*Don Raymundo Boricano (1881)\n*\n*Don Simon Ruiz (1883)\n*\n*Don Simon Guiang (1885)\n*\n*Don Vinancio Gallardo (1887)\n*\n*Don Pablo Boricano (1889)\n*\n*Don Lauriano Kadarang (1891)\n*\n*Don Luiz Bonilla (1893)\n*\n*Don Tomas Braga (1895)\n\n===President during the Revolution===\n\n*Don Mauricio Gallardo (1898\u20131900)\n*\n*Don Tomas Braga (1900\u20131901)\n*\n*Don Carlos Ruiz (1901\u20131902) \n\n\n===Municipal President during the civil government===\n\n*Don Paulino Mendoza (1904\u20131905)\n*\n*Don Francisco Bustamante (1906\u20131907)\n*\n*Don Jacinto Braga (1908\u20131911)\n*\n*Don Nicolas Guiang (1911\u20131912)\n*\n*Don Anacleto Ruiz (1912\u20131916)\n*\n*Don Juan Eonado (1916\u20131919)\n*\n*Don Matias Ruiz (1919\u20131922)\n*\n*Don Agustin R.

During the Spanish rule this municipality was part of the province of [[Zambales]].\n\n*Saint Isidore The Farmer Parish Church\n*\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0737 01.JPG|thumb|right|]]\nIn 1876, the Dominicans created the Parish church of St. Isidore, the patron saint of farmers, seeing that the town\u2019s chief industry was farming. The inhabitants, who were already steeped in Christian ways and they longed for a church where they can worship God. They realized their wish when the Spanish missionaries came and founded the Parish of St. Isidore the Farmer in the year 1876. The patron\u2019s feast is annually celebrated on May 15. It is also the town fiesta.\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0737 23.JPG|thumb|right|]]\nIt was the founding missionaries who built the present fa\u00e7ade of the church, made mostly of quarried adobe stones contributed by the faithful. The Dominicans left during the American regime and were succeeded by Filipino clergymen who continued the improvement of the house of God and the ministration of the faithful. The church edifice, made mostly of quarried adobe stones and rough-hewn lumber, was painstakingly built through many years. It is tribute to the Spanish missionaries that the present fa\u00e7ade which they had built a century ago has withstood the elements and ravages of time.\n==Tourist destinations==\n\n*'''Cabongaoan

This town is located at the edge of the Zambales mountain ranges, West of Mabini, South of Agno, North of Dasol and East of the China Sea. About 65 kilometers away from the capital town of Lingayen.\n\nBurgos was founded as an independent town in 1830 by the early Ilocanos from [[Paoay|Paoay, Ilocos Norte]] headed by Don Matias Guiang. The provincial government of [[Zambales]] has not ignored the ever increasing population and as it saw the necessity of a government to oversee the village. Don Matias Guiang made history, as quoted from the Philippine Archives, when on May 15, 1830 the Spanish Governor of [[Zambales]] issued a decree creating his settlement into a \"pueblo\" and appointed him as the first [[gobernadorcillo]] and was first named San Isidro in honor of its Patron Saint. Since there was another locality named San Isidro along the Lingayen Gulf, the residents later decided to add \"Potot\" derived from the description of the Amburayan River which appeared to be cut or \"potot\". Confusion however continued and persisted as mails for San Isidro de Potot were missent to the town of [[Labrador, Pangasinan|Labrador]] and those of the latter to the former town to finally solved the confusion and was finally renamed Burgos, after the Filipino Martyr priest who was executed during the Spanish regime. The renaming of the town was done in 1913 during the administration of Don Anacleto Ruiz.\n\nThe town of Burgos was ceded to the Province of Pangasinan, by virtue of Republic Act No. 1004 dated November 30, 1903 of the Philippine Commission. There also holds the westernmost point in Luzon.<br />\n[[File:Burgos, Pangasinan Welcome Sign.jpg|thumb|right|Welcome signage]]\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0797 24.JPG|thumb|right|Burgos Town Hall]]\n\n==Etymology==    \n\nBurgos, so-called today, this being the present official name, was known before as\u00a0San Isidro\u00a0during the Spanish time and was then within the geographical jurisdiction of the province of [[Zambales]].\n\nHow this place got its name is not definitely known. Judging from the fact that there were no accounts left circulating in the lips of the old people today as to how is got its name. \n\nThe early immigrants were God-fearing people. The have come to this place, lured by its vast agri-cultural possibilities. They were charmed by the rolling hills and the nice valleys cut-ting the plain. They envisioned that this is an ideal place that would give them ease, peace and comfort in their later life. When the early settlers migrated, to this place, they brought with them their religious beliefs. They worshipped fervently, revered highly [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore the Laborer]]\u00a0and pinned their fates and hopes of bountiful harvest upon the blessings of the Saint.\n\nAfter some years the settlers have increased their tribe and number and then came necessity of organizing their settlement into a public with Don Matias Guiang, who was then the most phosperous land owner of the place and the most influential personage to the settler, as the first\u00a0\"'''[[Gobernadorcillo]]'''\"\u00a0of the town. San Isidro de Potot was its incorporated name in honor of\u00a0St. Isidore the Laborer, whom the settlers have adopted, loved and revered as their Patron Saint. \n\nDuring the Spanish period and the early part of the American era, Burgos, Dasol and Mabini was a part of a settlement as one municipality known as San Isidro de Potot. Burgos may have been the last place to be found in the settlement but even though it still became the municipality's capital due to its fast-growing economy that it was declared an independent town upon its founding. The term \"'''Potot'''\" appended to the name San Isidro in an Ilocano adjective meaning \"'''clipped'''\", \"'''cut-off'''\" or disconnected. Not far from poblacion there is a brook or stream which during dry common ages has not continuous water. This stream, therefore, is discontinued and disconnected during summer months and to those now-comers in the place, this condition of the stream served as identification of the location of the town.\n\nThere were being then two municipalities in Pangasinan with the name of San Isidro Labrador and Potot, But the term \"'''Potot'''\" identified it well more from the other.\n\n===Folktale===\n\nThe Locals unveils the tale of how the town may have got its first name.\n\nLong ago when there were only few people living in the area where now the town of Burgos located, there were hunters who were hunting for wild animals. When these hunters got tired and thirsty, they looked for water to drink. As they were walking, they saw a man with a beard carrying a long cane. The hunters inquired from the man where they may be able to get water. The man drove his cane through the ground and suddenly water came flowing. Much to their surprise, the hunters remained silent for a moment. The man carrying a long cane was believed to be the patron saint, of the town, [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore the Laborer]]. From that time up to the present we can still see the spring with its made wall, which is also the source of water supply of some folks of the town.\n\n==History==\n\nIn the late 19th century in San Isidro de Potot, [[Zambales]] (now,'''\u00a0Burgos''', '''Pangasinan'''). The municipal Gobernadorcillo was Don Tomas Braga, and the parish priest of the town before the revolution was a native of\u00a0[[Barcelona|Barcelona, Spain]], and his name was Mariano Torrente.\n\nThe town was a prosperous community of farming and ranching. But the atmosphere was already seething with dissidence; winds of rebellion disturb the people.\n\nTwenty Spanish \"'''Cazadores'''\" had their cuartel or barracks in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. Cazadores literally means \"'''hunters'''\" their aim was to hunt the Filipino outlaws or dissidents.\n\nAcross the plaza from the cuartel was the big convent which stood at the same place where now stands the small convent. This convent was made out of adobe stones, 24 meters long and 12 meters wide; It was two stories high.\n\nAcross the plaza from the convent was the \"'''tribunal'''\" or municipal hall where now stands the present municipal hall building. This tribunal was made out of adobe stones. It was ten meters high.\n\nA tower was being constructed at the town plaza between the convent and the tribunal. This tower or fort was made of stones, 5 meters square inside dimensions, 3 stories high, and its walls are 1/2 meter thick.\n\nInsurgency was becoming widespread; the measures adopted by the Spaniards increased the number of outlaws. In Northern Zambales, which is now Western, Pangasinan, the soprano of the surgent was Ramon Manalang whose headquarters was in a hideout somewhere in Alaminos, Zambales (now '''[[Pangasinan]]''').\n\nIn San Isidro (now '''Burgos'''), the captain of the outlaws was Juanso Viado. The outlaws or dissidents were very numerous, had very few defective guns, and mostly armed with crude sabers, sharp spears and long bolos.\n\nIt was in February 1898. The outlaws attacked the cuartel of the Cazadores in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. The attackers greatly outnumbered the Cazadores. The Cazadores, armed with mauzzers, were poor shooters; while the Filipino outlaws, currently armed, were nomatoli for the well-armed Cazadores.\n\nThe twenty Spanish Cazadores managed to escape to the convent across the plaza. The Filipino attackers laid a siege to them.\n\nOne day, about mealtime, when the Filipino besiegers slackened their vigilance, the Cazadores were able to escape to the tower at the middle of the plaza. Already the cuartel was occupied by the outlaws.\n\nFor two nights and three days, the Cazadores stayed in the tower or fort without food. The people of the town including the municipal gobernadorcillo gone to distant the place.\n\nBut Padre Mariano Torrente reminded, being a peaceful man, and maintaining maturity in the fight, he acted as the lissome between the Spanish Cazadores and the Filipino outlaws.\n\nCaptain Juanso Viado of the outlaws told Padre Mariano Torrente that the cazadores should better surrender, or they would die of hunger. The priest was able to prevail upon the Spaniards to low down their arms.\n\nOn the third afternoon, the Spanish Cazadores threw their guns out of the windows of the tower in token of surrender. The Filipino outlaws took the guns, then the Cazadores went out of the tower, and the Filipino outlaws and Spanish Cazadores shook hands and embraced each other as good friends.\n\nBut such good friendship was short-lived. A fatal coincidence happened which turned the friendship into tragedy.\n\nThe morning following the surrender, news reached San Isidro that a big Spanish troop heavily armed arrived in Alaminos, Zambales (now '''[[Pangasinan]]''') on their way to San Isidro. This news alarmed the outlaws who reacted immediately seizing the Cazadores and taking them as prisoners. For the gladdened Cazadores naturally; the Spanish troop was being sent to save all Spaniards.\n\nThe Spanish Cazadores including Padre Mariano Torrente and also Padre Juan Naves of Dasol, were taken to the forest of Alimpayukan between San Isidro and Balincaguin (now'''\u00a0[[Mabini, Pangasinan]]'''). The Spaniards, upon being assured of their safety, and that no harm would happen, went willingly.\n\nUpon arriving at the forest, Alimpayukan, 20 Spanish Cazadores and 2 Spanish priests were blindfolded and their heads out-off. For the Spanish troop is about to arrive, and the Spaniards might escape to join them.\n\nShortly after the Spaniards were murdered, the big Spanish troop arrived in San Isidro and encircled the town. There were 20 uniformed Filipino outlaws or insurgents who were to form a local government. These were caught, taken to Mt. Polipol just a few kilometers east from the town, and were shot in a single file.\n\nAt that time, there was known as \"'''Juez de Cuchillo'''\", which means that if a priest was murdered in a town, the said town, being listed to\u00a0Juez de Cuchillo,\u00a0shall have its people killed and even their houses destroyed.\n\nIn San Isidro, no people could be seen for they had evacuated, and only the twenty Filipino insurgents were seen and caught and killed. The Spanish troop burned down the big houses that are owned by the richest and the most influential personage of the town.\n\nThe big Spanish troop left San Isidro, and then proceeded to [[Dasol]], in this place they killed the \"[[Principal\u00eda|'''principal\u00edas''']]\" and \"'''captains'''\", that is, the rich and the influential, and also burned their big houses. Because the Spanish priest of Dasol, Padre Juan Naves was beheaded in the forest of Alimpayukan; and many of the insurgents were from Dasol for the body of outlaws, headed by captain Juanso Viado, came from many places.\n\nThe big Spanish troop left [[Dasol]] empty-handed, a lot of people were killed including the rich and influential, so was their big houses were also burned down and left into ashes.\n\nThe Spanish detachments in the northern towns of Zambales was defeated and around 50 Spanish Friars were annihilated. These were the parish priests of [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]], [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], [[Bani, Pangasinan|Bani]], [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Balincaguin]], [[Dasol]] and San Isidro de Potot.\n\nNothing more was heard of the Spanish troop. Perhaps they were secured or perhaps imprisoned by the outlaws.\n\nWhen the Spanish troop had left, The town insurgents returned and established a local Katipunan Government. Don Mauricio Gallardo was made the president of the town.\n\nThe Katipunan Government was functioning smoothly, at least in San Isidro. In November 1900, Gen. Miguel and Don Miguel and Don Mauro Ortis came to recruit volunteers to meet the Americans in\u00a0[[Mangatarem]]. The volunteers went to Mangatarem, but poorly armed, had to retreat before the heavy American arms and cobranded. Nicolas Guiang, who was among those recruited, back across the mountains to Mt. Pita, then went to Infanta, and then back to San Isidro.\n\nThe Americans moved swiftly. They occupied San Isidro by December 1900 and established peace and order. They came with their wives. The costumes of the American women had decided influences in changing the Filipino costumes from oriental to occidental.\n\nThe Americans established a policy of attraction and launched it literally. They gave clothes, freely goods and tolerated the local customs.\n\nIn 1901 a severe storm hit San Isidro. The big convent was wrecked. So was the municipal building. The town church managed to survive and some of the original structures of the church still stands in some years, but It faced several renovations through the years due to avoid collapsing possibilities.\n\nIn 1903, the northern part of Zambales was annexed to the Province of Pangasinan. The municipalities ceded were [[Alaminos, Pangasinan|Alaminos]], [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]], [[Bani, Pangasinan|Bani]],\u00a0[[Agno, Pangasinan|Agno]], [[Infanta, Pangasinan|Infanta]] and San Isidro de Potot (Burgos, [[Dasol]], and [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Mabini)]]. Townsfolk cited alleged lack of concern for the town's interest and welfare by the Zambales provincial government therefore they were incorporated to Pangasinan.\n\nShortly after, the towns of Northern Zambales were incorporated in Pangasinan. [[Dasol]] and [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Balincaguin]] seceded from San Isidro de Potot,  Balincaguin was renamed as Mabini (in honor of\u00a0'''[[Apolinario Mabini]]'''). San Isidro de Potot was changed to Burgos (in honor of '''[[Jos\u00e9 Burgos]]'''), and in order not to confuse it to\u00a0[[Labrador, Pangasinan|San Isidro Labrador de Tobuang]] of Pangasinan.\n\n==List of Municipal Heads==\n\nThe name of persons who held a leading official position during the Spanish period and thereafter were the following.\n\n\n[[Gobernadorcillo]]:\n\n*Don Matias Guiang (1830)\n*\n\n*Don Pascual Bonostro (1831)\n*\n\n*Don Diego Bustamante (1832)\n*\n*Don Fernando Bonilla (1833)\n*\n*Don Paulo Padua (1834)\n*\n*Don Matias Guiang (1835)\n*\n*Don Juan Discoloso (1836)\n*\n*Don Juan Bonostro (1837)\n*\n*Don Agustin Cuaresma (1838)\n*\n*Don Pascual de Guzman (1839)\n*\n*Don Paulo Doctor (1840)\n*\n*Don Pedro Guiang (1841)\n*\n*Don Vicente Bondal (1842)\n*\n*Don Miguel Cuaresma (1843)\n*\n*Don Ramon Bustria (1844)\n*\n*Don Exequel Ugto (1845)\n*\n*Don Agapito Tolentino Braga (1846)\n*\n*Don Domingo Valdez (1847)\n*\n*Don Tomas Guiang (1848)\n*\n*Don Jose de Leon (1849)\n*\n*Don Juan Bonilla (1850)\n*\n*Don Henenio Doctor (1851)\n*\n*Don Raymundo Bonostro (1852)\n*\n*Don Romualdo Braga (1853)\n*\n*Don Melchor Ruiz (1854)\n*\n*Don Paulino Bustamante (1855)\n*\n*Don Feliciano de Guzman (1856)\n*\n*Don Eldefonzo Bona (1857)\n*\n*Don Cornelio Valdez (1858)\n*\n*Don Agapito Ugto (1859)\n*\n*Don Martin Gallardo (1860)\n*\n*Don Mariano Mendoza (1861)\n*\n*Don Anborcio Guiang (1862)\n*\n*Don Santiago Ruiz (1863)\n*\n*Don Santiago Ruiz (1864)\n*\n*Don Justo Bonada (1865)\n*\n*Don Victorio Braga (1867)\n*\n*Don Mauricio Gallardo (1869)\n*\n*Don Silvestro Ruiz (1871)\n*\n*Don Cornelio Braga (1873)\n*\n*Don Flaviano Cudal (1875)\n*\n*Don Francisco Guiang (1877)\n*\n*Don Lorenzo Bonando (1879)\n*\n*Don Raymundo Boricano (1881)\n*\n*Don Simon Ruiz (1883)\n*\n*Don Simon Guiang (1885)\n*\n*Don Vinancio Gallardo (1887)\n*\n*Don Pablo Boricano (1889)\n*\n*Don Lauriano Kadarang (1891)\n*\n*Don Luiz Bonilla (1893)\n*\n*Don Tomas Braga (1895)\n\n\n\n===President during the Revolution===\n\n*Don Mauricio Gallardo (1898\u20131900)\n*\n*Don Tomas Braga (1900\u20131901)\n*\n*Don Carlos Ruiz (1901\u20131902) \n\n\n\n===Municipal President during the civil government===\n\n*Don Paulino Mendoza (1904\u20131905)\n*\n*Don Francisco Bustamante (1906\u20131907)\n*\n*Don Jacinto Braga (1908\u20131911)\n*\n*Don Nicolas Guiang (1911\u20131912)\n*\n*Don Anacleto Ruiz (1912\u20131916)\n*\n*Don Juan Eonado (1916\u20131919)\n*\n*Don Matias Ruiz (1919\u20131922)\n*\n*Don Agustin R.

The inhabitants, who were already steeped in Christian ways and they longed for a church where they can worship God. They realized their wish when the Spanish missionaries came and founded the Parish of St. Isidore the Farmer in the year 1876. The patron\u2019s feast is annually celebrated on May 15. It is also the town fiesta.\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0737 23.JPG|thumb|right|]]\nIt was the founding missionaries who built the present fa\u00e7ade of the church, made mostly of quarried adobe stones contributed by the faithful. The Dominicans left during the American regime and were succeeded by Filipino clergymen who continued the improvement of the house of God and the ministration of the faithful. The church edifice, made mostly of quarried adobe stones and rough-hewn lumber, was painstakingly built through many years. It is tribute to the Spanish missionaries that the present fa\u00e7ade which they had built a century ago has withstood the elements and ravages of time.\n==Tourist destinations==\n\n*Cabongaoan White Sand Beach\n[[File:Cabongaoan Beach, Burgos, Pangasinan.jpg|thumb|right|Cabongaoan Beach]]\n*Death Pool/Depth Pool (Lagoon)\n[[File:Death Pool, Cabongaoan Beach, Burgos, Pangasinan.jpg|thumb|right|Death Pool]]\n*Sangbay Falls\n[[File:Sangbay Falls.jpg|thumb|right|Sangbay Falls]]\n*Danao Lake\n*Rolling Hills\n*Pao Beach\n*Paratec Beach\n\n==Barangays==\n\nBurgos is politically subdivided into 14 [[Barangay|barangays]].\n\n* Anapao (Bur Anapac)\n* Cacayasen\n* Concordia\n* Ilio-ilio (Iliw-iliw)\n* Papallasen\n*[[Poblacion]]\n* Pogoruac\n* Don Matias\n* San Miguel\n* San Pascual\n* San Vicente\n* Sapa Grande\n* Sapa Peque\u00f1a\n* Tambacan\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census|align=none\n| title = Population census of Burgos\n| 1903 = 3488\n| 1918 = 5143\n| 1939 = 8075\n| 1948 = 7891\n| 1960 = 10030\n| 1970 = 10586\n| 1975 = 12430\n| 1980 = 12817\n| 1990 = 14774\n| 1995 = 17003\n| 2000 = 18142\n| 2007 = 20187\n| 2010 = 18315\n| 2015 = 21637\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box|width=auto\n|location = Burgos, Pangasinan\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n| Jan high C = 31\n| Feb high C = 31\n| Mar high C = 32\n| Apr high C = 34\n| May high C = 35\n| Jun high C = 34\n| Jul high C = 32\n| Aug high C = 32\n| Sep high C = 32\n| Oct high C = 32\n| Nov high C = 32\n| Dec high C = 31\n| Jan low C = 22\n| Feb low C = 22\n| Mar low C = 22\n| Apr low C = 24\n| May low C = 24\n| Jun low C = 24\n| Jul low C = 24\n| Aug low C = 24\n| Sep low C = 24\n| Oct low C = 23\n| Nov low C = 23\n| Dec low C = 22\n| Jan precipitation mm = 13.6\n| Jan rain days = 3 \n| Feb precipitation mm = 10.4 \n| Feb rain days = 2\n| Mar precipitation mm = 18.2 \n| Mar rain days = 2\n| Apr precipitation mm = 15.7 \n| Apr rain days = 4\n| May precipitation mm = 178.4\n| May rain days = 14    \n| Jun precipitation mm = 227.9 \n| Jun rain days = 16\n| Jul precipitation mm = 368\n| Jul rain days = 23\n| Aug precipitation mm = 306.6 \n| Aug rain days = 21\n| Sep precipitation mm = 310.6 \n| Sep rain days = 21\n| Oct precipitation mm = 215.7 \n| Oct rain days = 15\n| Nov precipitation mm = 70.3 \n| Nov rain days = 10\n| Dec precipitation mm = 31.1 \n| Dec rain days = 6\n|source 1 = World Weather Online<ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = http://www.worldweatheronline.com/Burgos-weather-averages/Pangasinan/PH.aspx\n| title = Burgos, Pangasinan: Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = World Weather Online\n| accessdate = 26 September 2015}}</ref>\n| date=September 2015}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170202040236/http://www.competitive.org.ph/cmcindex/pages/profile/?lgu=Burgos%20(PS)  Municipal Profile at the National Competitiveness Council of the Philippines]\n* [http://pangasinan.gov.ph/the-province/cities-and-municipalities/burgos/ Burgos at the Pangasinan Government Website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20161010201809/http://www.blgs.gov.ph/lgpmsv2/cmshome/index.php?pageID=23 Local Governance Performance Management System]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120413163013/http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/default.asp Philippine Standard Geographic Code]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081120024509/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/census2007/index.html Philippine Census Information]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130715074746/https://pangasinan.org/burgos/  Pangasinan.org : Burgos Family and School Reunion Archives]\n\n{{Geographic location\n| Centre = Burgos\n| North  = [[Agno, Pangasinan|Agno]]\n| East   = [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Mabini]]\n| South  = [[Dasol, Pangasinan|Dasol]]\n| West   = ''[[South China Sea]]'' / \n[[File:Flag of Vietnam.svg|30px]]\n''[[Da Nang]], [[Vietnam]]''\n}}\n{{Pangasinan}}\n{{One Pangasinan Alliance}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Pangasinan]]\n[[Category:1830 establishments in the Spanish East Indies]]\n\n\n{{IlocosR-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "SharpV1", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgos,_Pangasinan"}

She is also considered as one of the rich voiced singers whose pronunciation of the syllables are to be very clear and precise in any of the languages she sang.<ref name=\"aboutps\">{{cite web|url=http://psusheela.org/aboutps.html|title=Melody Queen P. Susheela - About Smt. P. Susheela|publisher=}}</ref> In a career spanning more than six decades, she has recorded nearly 50,000 songs in various [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] including [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Kannada]], [[Malayalam]], [[Hindi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Oriya language|Oriya]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Tulu language|Tulu]] and [[Badaga language|Badaga]]. She has also sung for [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]] films. Her mother tongue is [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. She can also speak [[Tamil language|Tamil]] fluently, with a little [[Hindi language|Hindi]] and [[Kannada]].\n\n==Personal life==\nSusheela was born in [[Andhra Pradesh]], India, as the daughter of Pulapaka Mukunda Rao, a leading advocate in Vizianagaram, Vizianagaram District, Andhra Pradesh State. She is married to Dr. Mohan Rao; they have a son named Jayakrishna and two granddaughters named Jayashree and Shubashree. Her daughter-in-law, Sandhya Jayakrishna, is a singer who debuted with [[A. R. Rahman]] in ''[[Iruvar]].\n\n==Education==\nAfter completion of schooling, Susheela joined in Maharaja's Music College under the tutelage of [[Dwaram Venkataswamy Naidu]] who was the Principal, Vizianagaram, and completed Diploma in Music from Andhra University in First Class at a very early age.\n\nP. Susheela went on to become the most successful playback singers of south India from 1950 to 1990.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Debut : 1950\u20131954===\nBorn into a music-loving family, Susheela had been nurtured with formal classical music training at a very young age. She used to participate in all the musical competitions at her school and Vizianagaram town events. She developed the crucial nuances in singing songs with apt expressions and modulations through her extensive training during those days. She also sang few songs for the [[All India Radio]] (AIR) for their private program telecasts.\n\nIn 1950, music director [[Pendyala Nageswara Rao]] was on the look out for some fresh voices to sing for his new film compositions. He approached the AIR to help him shortlist some of the finest singers who have performed for the Radio. AIR sent forward five singers of whom Susheela was selected after some thorough audition tests. She was immediately signed on for the Tamil film ''Petra Thai'' (1952) for a duet song \"Edhuku Azhaithhai\" with [[A. M. Rajah|A. M. Raja]].<ref name=\"aboutps\"/> This was subsequently made in Telugu as ''[[Kanna Talli]]'' for which she recorded the same duet with [[Ghantasala (singer)|Ghantasala]]. This resulted in her long term employment with [[AVM Studios]] singing for their productions alone with a fixed monthly salary. The studio owner [[A. V. Meiyappan]] hired a Tamil trainer for Susheela to hone her Tamil pronunciation skills. Thus Susheela began her illustrious career gaining abundant knowledge about music and language. She debuted into Kannada language with the film ''Maadidunno Maaraya'' in 1954.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://psusheela.org/articles/kan/aregini_kannada.html|title=Untitled Document|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Breakthrough : 1955 \u2013 1960 ===\nIt was not easy for a newcomer to foray into the musical scene in the 1950s with the domination of eminent female vocalists like [[P. Leela]], [[M. L. Vasanthakumari]], [[Jikki]] among others ruling the playback industry. Yet, Susheela made her own mark with her distinct and clear vocals. The year 1955 saw Susheela raising to popularity with her back to back hit songs both in Tamil and Telugu film industries. ''[[Missamma]]'' released in 1955 had hugely popular songs backed with strong carnatic classical essence. Susheela created a huge impact among the listeners with her effortless renditions of the toughest notations. The same year released Tamil film ''Kanavane Kan Kanda Deivam'' made her a household name in Tamil Nadu.<ref name=\"aboutps\"/>\n\nThus began a huge legacy of Susheela, who sang in almost all the films produced since 1955 through 1960s and 1970s till 1985. The legendary Tamil musicians [[M. S. Viswanathan|Viswanathan]] \u2013 [[T. K. Ramamoorthy|Ramamurthy]] duo wrote some of the most evergreen songs of [[Tamil language|Tamil]] cinema history in the voice of Susheela. Her duets with the acclaimed singers [[Ghantasala (singer)|Ghantasala]] in Telugu, [[T. M. Soundararajan]] in Tamil and [[P. B. Srinivas]] in Kannada marked a new era of duet songs in the South Indian music industry. She, along with T. M. Soundararajan went on to record more than hundreds of songs with Viswanathan \u2013 Ramamurthy.<ref name=\"aboutps\"/> Susheela's blockbuster Kannada song \"Viraha novu nooru taraha\" for the film ''[[Edakallu Guddada Mele]]'' is listed as one of the top 10 evergreen songs in Indian cinema. Her combination with actress [[Jayanthi (actress)|Jayanthi]] is very popular in [[Karnataka]].\n\n=== Successful domination : 1960 \u2013 1985 ===\nThe early 1960s saw Susheela grow as an undisputed lead female singer across all the south Indian language films putting all the older veteran singers to the background.  The year 1960 saw Susheela entering the Malayalam films with the [[V. Dakshinamurthy]] compositions for the film ''Seetha''. From then, she went on to record numerous hit songs with all the Malayalam composers like [[G. Devarajan]], [[M. K. Arjunan]] among others. She recorded many Malayalam duets with the veteran singer [[K. J. Yesudas]]. Her association with M.S. Viswanathan continued even after M.S.V split up with Ramamoorthy in 1965 and under M.S.V her duets with T.M. Sounderrajan and others and her solo songs were too popular with audience and made her first choice singer for every other music composer and film producer from 1960\u20131985. M.S.V.'s composition fetched her the very first [[National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer]] in 1969 for her prolific rendition of \"Naalai Intha Velai Paarthu\" for the Tamil film ''Uyarndha Manidhan''. The same song got her the [[Tamil Nadu State Film Awards|Tamil Nadu State Award]] as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://psusheela.org/awards.html|title=Melody Queen P. Susheela|publisher=}}</ref> Thereby, Susheela became one of the first recipients of the most dignified National awards in India. It was during these years the Nightingale of India, [[Lata Mangeshkar]] developed a strong friendship with Susheela and praised all her works frequently. Her work in Film Chandipriya  is superb with song \"Sri Bhagya Rekha - Janani Janani\" with Jayaprada superb dance. MSiswanathan is regarded by her as her mentor and in his music direction she has maximum popular hit songs from 1955\u20131995.\n\nThe 1970s also saw Susheela in her prime form winning almost all the awards both nationally and in all the four states of Southern India. She also recorded even Hindi songs during this period with music directors like KV Mahdevan, Laximkant Pyarelal, L. Vaidyanathan and Laxmi Kiran, S.L. Manohar, Ajit merchant, G. Devarajan and S.N. Tripathi. It was in this era that she sang few notable songs for another prolific Indian music director [[Illayaraja]]. Though Janaki took a leading position from 1980 with her strong association with M.S.V and Ilayaraja, Susheela continued to be at the top till 1985 and after 1985 was still opted by several music directors for her legendary vocals. After 1986, she became selective about film songs and continued to have hit film songs till 2005.\n\n=== Shift to non-films : 1985\u2013 2000s ===\nWith [[S. Janaki]] and [[Vani Jayaram]] taking over the Southern film songs center stage from 1985 and [[K. S. Chitra]] beginning her career, Susheela slowly shifted her focus from films to devotionals and light music. But she continued to get to sing melodious film songs from 1984\u20131999 though she had after 1985 cut down on offers for singing in films. She even won awards for songs in Telugu films \u2013 ''Viswanatha Nayakudu'' in 1987, ''Godavari Pongindi'' in 1989 and Tamil film ''Varam'' in 1989. She sang duets with Kishore Kumar in 1986 for the film ''Singhasan'' \u2013 \"Chalta Hai Do Dilon Ka Kaise Sansaar\" and \"Tere Liye Maine Janam\" which became popular. She also concentrated more on stage shows across the Globe where many associations worldwide invited her to perform for their organised shows. She recorded more than 1000 devotional songs for various audio companies. In 1988, acclaimed music composer [[Naushad]] insisted her to sing \"Janaki Jaane\" for his Malayalam film ''[[Dhwani]]''. She also recorded few of her career best songs for [[Illayaraja]], [[A. R. Rahman]] and others in the 1990s. \"Kannukku Mai Azhagu\" from the film ''[[Pudhiya Mugam]]'' (1993) composed by Rahman was praised all over for its lyrical content and rendition. She had hit songs in Tamil till 2005 and sang many devotional and folk songs from 1986\u20132005 and did many live shows from 1990 to 2005.\n\n==P. Susheela Trust : 2008\u2013present==\nThe P. Susheela Trust, formed in 2008, has a monthly pension payment scheme and a few musicians in need are being benefited through it.

She is fondly called \"Gana Kokila\" and \"Gana Saraswathi\". She is also considered as one of the rich voiced singers whose pronunciation of the syllables are to be very clear and precise in any of the languages she sang.<ref name=\"aboutps\">{{cite web|url=http://psusheela.org/aboutps.html|title=Melody Queen P. Susheela - About Smt. P. Susheela|publisher=}}</ref> In a career spanning more than six decades, she has recorded nearly 50,000 songs in various [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] including [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Kannada]], [[Malayalam]], [[Hindi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Oriya language|Oriya]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Tulu language|Tulu]] and [[Badaga language|Badaga]]. She has also sung for [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]] films. Her mother tongue is [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. She can also speak [[Tamil language|Tamil]] fluently, with a little [[Hindi language|Hindi]] and [[Kannada]].\n\n==Personal life==\nSusheela was born in [[Andhra Pradesh]], India, as the daughter of Pulapaka Mukunda Rao, a leading advocate in Vizianagaram, Vizianagaram District, Andhra Pradesh State. She is married to Dr. Mohan Rao; they have a son named Jayakrishna and two granddaughters named Jayashree and Shubashree. Her daughter-in-law, Sandhya Jayakrishna, is a singer who debuted with [[A. R. Rahman]] in ''[[Iruvar]].\n\n==Education==\nAfter completion of schooling, Susheela joined in Maharaja's Music College under the tutelage of [[Dwaram Venkataswamy Naidu]] who was the Principal, Vizianagaram, and completed Diploma in Music from Andhra University in First Class at a very early age.\n\nP. Susheela went on to become the most successful playback singers of south India from 1950 to 1990.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Debut : 1950\u20131954===\nBorn into a music-loving family, Susheela had been nurtured with formal classical music training at a very young age. She used to participate in all the musical competitions at her school and Vizianagaram town events. She developed the crucial nuances in singing songs with apt expressions and modulations through her extensive training during those days. She also sang few songs for the [[All India Radio]] (AIR) for their private program telecasts.\n\nIn 1950, music director [[Pendyala Nageswara Rao]] was on the look out for some fresh voices to sing for his new film compositions. He approached the AIR to help him shortlist some of the finest singers who have performed for the Radio. AIR sent forward five singers of whom Susheela was selected after some thorough audition tests. She was immediately signed on for the Tamil film ''Petra Thai'' (1952) for a duet song \"Edhuku Azhaithhai\" with [[A. M. Rajah|A. M. Raja]].<ref name=\"aboutps\"/> This was subsequently made in Telugu as ''[[Kanna Talli]]'' for which she recorded the same duet with [[Ghantasala (singer)|Ghantasala]]. This resulted in her long term employment with [[AVM Studios]] singing for their productions alone with a fixed monthly salary. The studio owner [[A. V. Meiyappan]] hired a Tamil trainer for Susheela to hone her Tamil pronunciation skills. Thus Susheela began her illustrious career gaining abundant knowledge about music and language. She debuted into Kannada language with the film ''Maadidunno Maaraya'' in 1954.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://psusheela.org/articles/kan/aregini_kannada.html|title=Untitled Document|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Breakthrough : 1955 \u2013 1960 ===\nIt was not easy for a newcomer to foray into the musical scene in the 1950s with the domination of eminent female vocalists like [[P. Leela]], [[M. L. Vasanthakumari]], [[Jikki]] among others ruling the playback industry. Yet, Susheela made her own mark with her distinct and clear vocals. The year 1955 saw Susheela raising to popularity with her back to back hit songs both in Tamil and Telugu film industries. ''[[Missamma]]'' released in 1955 had hugely popular songs backed with strong carnatic classical essence. Susheela created a huge impact among the listeners with her effortless renditions of the toughest notations. The same year released Tamil film ''Kanavane Kan Kanda Deivam'' made her a household name in Tamil Nadu.<ref name=\"aboutps\"/>\n\nThus began a huge legacy of Susheela, who sang in almost all the films produced since 1955 through 1960s and 1970s till 1985. The legendary Tamil musicians [[M. S. Viswanathan|Viswanathan]] \u2013 [[T. K. Ramamoorthy|Ramamurthy]] duo wrote some of the most evergreen songs of [[Tamil language|Tamil]] cinema history in the voice of Susheela. Her duets with the acclaimed singers [[Ghantasala (singer)|Ghantasala]] in Telugu, [[T. M. Soundararajan]] in Tamil and [[P. B. Srinivas]] in Kannada marked a new era of duet songs in the South Indian music industry. She, along with T. M. Soundararajan went on to record more than hundreds of songs with Viswanathan \u2013 Ramamurthy.<ref name=\"aboutps\"/> Susheela's blockbuster Kannada song \"Viraha novu nooru taraha\" for the film ''[[Edakallu Guddada Mele]]'' is listed as one of the top 10 evergreen songs in Indian cinema. Her combination with actress [[Jayanthi (actress)|Jayanthi]] is very popular in [[Karnataka]].\n\n=== Successful domination : 1960 \u2013 1985 ===\nThe early 1960s saw Susheela grow as an undisputed lead female singer across all the south Indian language films putting all the older veteran singers to the background.  The year 1960 saw Susheela entering the Malayalam films with the [[V. Dakshinamurthy]] compositions for the film ''Seetha''. From then, she went on to record numerous hit songs with all the Malayalam composers like [[G. Devarajan]], [[M. K. Arjunan]] among others. She recorded many Malayalam duets with the veteran singer [[K. J. Yesudas]]. Her association with M.S. Viswanathan continued even after M.S.V split up with Ramamoorthy in 1965 and under M.S.V her duets with T.M. Sounderrajan and others and her solo songs were too popular with audience and made her first choice singer for every other music composer and film producer from 1960\u20131985. M.S.V.'s composition fetched her the very first [[National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer]] in 1969 for her prolific rendition of \"Naalai Intha Velai Paarthu\" for the Tamil film ''Uyarndha Manidhan''. The same song got her the [[Tamil Nadu State Film Awards|Tamil Nadu State Award]] as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://psusheela.org/awards.html|title=Melody Queen P. Susheela|publisher=}}</ref> Thereby, Susheela became one of the first recipients of the most dignified National awards in India. It was during these years the Nightingale of India, [[Lata Mangeshkar]] developed a strong friendship with Susheela and praised all her works frequently. Her work in Film Chandipriya  is superb with song \"Sri Bhagya Rekha - Janani Janani\" with Jayaprada superb dance. MSiswanathan is regarded by her as her mentor and in his music direction she has maximum popular hit songs from 1955\u20131995.\n\nThe 1970s also saw Susheela in her prime form winning almost all the awards both nationally and in all the four states of Southern India. She also recorded even Hindi songs during this period with music directors like KV Mahdevan, Laximkant Pyarelal, L. Vaidyanathan and Laxmi Kiran, S.L. Manohar, Ajit merchant, G. Devarajan and S.N. Tripathi. It was in this era that she sang few notable songs for another prolific Indian music director [[Illayaraja]]. Though Janaki took a leading position from 1980 with her strong association with M.S.V and Ilayaraja, Susheela continued to be at the top till 1985 and after 1985 was still opted by several music directors for her legendary vocals. After 1986, she became selective about film songs and continued to have hit film songs till 2005.\n\n=== Shift to non-films : 1985\u2013 2000s ===\nWith [[S. Janaki]] and [[Vani Jayaram]] taking over the Southern film songs center stage from 1985 and [[K. S. Chitra]] beginning her career, Susheela slowly shifted her focus from films to devotionals and light music. But she continued to get to sing melodious film songs from 1984\u20131999 though she had after 1985 cut down on offers for singing in films. She even won awards for songs in Telugu films \u2013 ''Viswanatha Nayakudu'' in 1987, ''Godavari Pongindi'' in 1989 and Tamil film ''Varam'' in 1989. She sang duets with Kishore Kumar in 1986 for the film ''Singhasan'' \u2013 \"Chalta Hai Do Dilon Ka Kaise Sansaar\" and \"Tere Liye Maine Janam\" which became popular. She also concentrated more on stage shows across the Globe where many associations worldwide invited her to perform for their organised shows. She recorded more than 1000 devotional songs for various audio companies. In 1988, acclaimed music composer [[Naushad]] insisted her to sing \"Janaki Jaane\" for his Malayalam film ''[[Dhwani]]''. She also recorded few of her career best songs for [[Illayaraja]], [[A. R. Rahman]] and others in the 1990s. \"Kannukku Mai Azhagu\" from the film ''[[Pudhiya Mugam]]'' (1993) composed by Rahman was praised all over for its lyrical content and rendition. She had hit songs in Tamil till 2005 and sang many devotional and folk songs from 1986\u20132005 and did many live shows from 1990 to 2005.\n\n==P. Susheela Trust : 2008\u2013present==\nThe P. Susheela Trust, formed in 2008, has a monthly pension payment scheme and a few musicians in need are being benefited through it. On every 13 November there would be a musical concert during which a senior artist(s) chosen by a panel is conferred with the Lifetime Achievement awards and the P Susheela Trust award.
