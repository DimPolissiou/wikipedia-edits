Corn syrup, also known as [[glucose syrup]] to confectioners, is used in foods to soften texture, add volume, prevent crystallization of sugar, and enhance flavor. Corn syrup is distinct from [[high-fructose corn syrup]] (HFCS), which is manufactured from corn syrup by converting a large proportion of its [[glucose]] into [[fructose]] using the enzyme [[xylose isomerase|D-xylose isomerase]], thus producing a sweeter compound due to higher levels of fructose.\n\nThe more general term [[glucose syrup]] is often used [[synonym]]ously with corn syrup, since glucose syrup in the [[United States]] is most commonly made from [[corn starch]].<ref>Structure of the world starch market, European Commission - Directorate Agricultural and Rural development, Evaluation of the Community Policy for Starch and Starch Products, Final report 2002, Chapter 1, page 3 [http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/eval/reports/amidon/chap1.pdf]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sugar.org/consumers/sweet_by_nature.asp?id=277 |title=Sugar Association Alternative Carbohydrate Sweeteners |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923020810/http://www.sugar.org/consumers/sweet_by_nature.asp?id=277 |archivedate=23 September 2006 }}</ref> Technically, glucose syrup is any liquid starch [[hydrolysis|hydrolysate]] of mono-, di-, and higher-[[saccharide]]s and can be made from any source of [[starch]]; [[wheat]], [[tapioca]] and [[potatoes]] are the most common other sources.<ref>[http://www.starch.dk/isi/starch/tm33www-wheat.htm Wheat starch, Application, International Starch Institute Denmark]</ref><ref>[http://webapp.ciat.cgiar.org/asia_cassava/pdf/proceedings_workshop_00/593.pdf Global casave outlook; Guy Henry, Andrew Westby; 2007; page 600] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405043608/http://webapp.ciat.cgiar.org/asia_cassava/pdf/proceedings_workshop_00/593.pdf |date=5 April 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.starch.dk/isi/starch/glosary.htm |title=International Starch Association Starch and Glucose Glossary}}</ref>\n\n== Commercial preparation ==\nHistorically, corn syrup was produced by combining corn starch with dilute [[hydrochloric acid]], and then heating the mixture under intense pressure. The process was invented by the German chemist [[Gottlieb Kirchhoff]] in 1812. Currently, corn syrup is obtained through a multi-step [[bioprocess]]. First, the [[enzyme]] \u03b1-[[amylase]] is added to a mixture of corn starch and water. \u03b1-amylase is secreted by various species of the [[bacteria|bacterium]] genus ''[[Bacillus]]'' and the enzyme is isolated from the liquid in which the bacteria were grown. The enzyme breaks down the starch into [[oligosaccharide]]s, which are then broken into glucose molecules by adding the enzyme [[glucoamylase]], known also as \"\u03b3-amylase\". Glucoamylase is secreted by various species of the [[fungus]] ''[[Aspergillus]]''; the enzyme is isolated from the liquid in which the fungus is grown. The glucose can then be transformed into fructose by passing the glucose through a column that is loaded with the enzyme [[Xylose isomerase|D-xylose isomerase]], an enzyme that is isolated from the growth medium of any of several bacteria.<ref>Martin Chaplin and Christopher Bucke, ''Enzyme Technology'' (Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1990), pages 146-154.

Carr attended the [[University of Manitoba]] where she obtained her Bachelor of Arts degree (BA) and her Bachelor of Laws degree (LLB). She received her Call to the Bar from the [[Law Society of Manitoba]]. After briefly practising law, Carr decided to pursue her interest in languages. She enrolled at le Coll\u00e8ge Universitaire de Saint-Boniface where she received her Certificat en \u00c9ducation and was the recipient of the Manitoba Government Book Prize for highest standing in her program.<ref>{{cite book |title=The University of Manitoba 104th Annual Convocation |date=1983}}</ref> She subsequently taught French Immersion before moving to [[Kelowna]] with her family in 1999. She is married and is the sister-in-law of [[James Gordon Carr]], Member of Parliament.\n\n==Writing style and influences==\nCarr's early poetry from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s is more representative of traditional meter and rhyme. She subsequently began to experiment with different forms and styles while continuing to compose traditional poetry in set forms such as [[pantoum]] and [[ghazal]]. An admirer of [[Emily Dickinson]], Carr liked the use of [[em dashes]] and often incorporated them into her poems. In the 2000s, Carr's poetry style became more eclectic as she experimented with design. This was particularly evident in her [[Visual poetry|visual]] and [[concrete poetry]] as well as in her experimental math / science poems such as \"The Fickle Nature of the Parabola\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carr |first1=Fern G. Z. |title=The Fickle Nature of the Parabola |journal=Windsor Review |date=Fall 2018 |volume=43 |issue=2 |page=128}}</ref> and \"Holocaust Genealogy\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carr |first1=Fern G. Z. |title=Holocaust Genealogy |journal=mgversion2 |date=July 2016 |volume=85 |page=84}}</ref> To date, her stylistic focus is [[free verse]].\n\nWhile Carr's poetry primarily is written in English, she also composes poems in [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Yiddish]] and the [[Chinese Mandarin]] dialect. Even though she occasionally translates the works of other poets, she tends to focus on bilingual and trilingual side-by-side translations of her own poetry.\n\nMany of Carr's poems were influenced by her early years in Winnipeg's West End where she bore witness to poverty and crime. While this darkness is evident in some of her poetry, she also composes poems which evoke a diverse array of human emotions.\n\n==''Shards of Crystal''==\n''Shards of Crystal'' reflects a dichotomy and as such, is described as a metamorphosis of darkness to light. Dealing with issues such as suicide, trauma, dementia, cruelty to animals, and the death of a child, the book then gradually changes course. It begins its transformative move towards the beauty of life with poems about musicality, spiritual liberation and the philosophy of existence. It culminates in a philosophical examination of mankind's place in the universe with Carr's signature poem, \"I Am\".<ref name=\"parl.ca\">{{cite web|url=https://bdp.parl.ca/About/Parliament/Poet/poem-selected-former-poet-laureate2-e.html?id=1&id4=254|title=The Parliamentary Poet Laureate|website=Bdp.parl.ca|accessdate=6 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe imagery in ''Shards of Crystal'' parallels the darkness-to-light chronology of Carr's poems. This transition is essentially a redemptive move both literally and metaphorically, reconciling the pain of \"Shards\" at the outset of the book with the beauty and enlightenment of \"Crystal\" at the conclusion. Beginning with the darkness of night and becoming progressively lighter, her poems ultimately achieve the illumination of the eternal. This is in keeping with the overarching theme of hope as expressed by the Victor Hugo quote at the start of the book: \"Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hugo |first1=Victor |title=Les Mis\u00e9rables |date=1987 |publisher=Signet Classics |isbn=9780451525260 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/lesmisrablessign00vict }}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\nCarr has been published extensively worldwide in Australia, Austria, Canada, China, Cyprus, Finland, France, Holland, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Malawi, Mauritius, Mayotte Island, Mexico, Morocco, Nepal, New Zealand, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Romania, Seychelles, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom (in England, Scotland and Wales) and USA.\n\nAdditionally, she has written literary non-fiction articles which have been published in the Federation of BC Writers ''WordWorks Magazine'' (2020) and ''Part of the Discourse: An Interdisciplinary Humanities Journal'' (2019).\n\n===Books===\n*''Shards of Crystal'' (Silver Bow Publishing, 2018) {{ISBN|978-1-927616-96-3}}\n\n===Selected anthologies===\n*''Dreamscapes'' - 2019\n*''Lost and Found'' - 2019\n*''Celestial Musings'' - 2018\n*''Climate of Opinion'' - 2017\n*''Nuclear Impact: Broken Atoms in Our Hands'' - 2017\n*''Fire and Sky'' - 2016\n*''Memory and Loss'' - 2016\n*''Childhood Regained'' - 2016\n*''Amsterdam Quarterly 2015 Yearbook'' - 2015\n*''Contemporary Poetry - An Anthology of Present Day Best Poems'' Vol. 2 - 2015\n*''Love Where the Nights are Twice as Long'' - 2015\n*''A Quiet Shelter There'' - 2015\n*''Storm Cycle 2013 - The Best of Kind of a Hurricane Press'' - 2014\n*''The Body Electric'' - 2013\n*''Voices Israel'' - 2012\n*''Sol: English Writing in Mexico'' - 2012\n*''Butterfly Away'' - 2011\n*''Van Gogh's Ear'' 7 - 2010\n\n===Selected journals===\n*''The Laurel Review'' 51.2 - 2018\n*''The London Reader'' - Autumn, 2017\n*''The Caf\u00e9 Review'' 27 - Winter, 2016\n*''Slant'' - Summer, 2015\n*''Pasque Petals'' - Fall 2015\n*''Whole Terrain'' 21 - 2014\n*''Zona de Carga'' No. 6 - August 2014\n*''MaLa - The Chengdu Bookworm Literary Journal'' 3 - June 2013\n*''Legal Studies Forum'' XXXVII, No. 1 - 2013\n*''phati'tude Literary Magazine'' 3, No. 3 - Fall 2011\n*''The Toronto Quarterly'' 8 - Nov. 2011\n*''White Wall Review'' 135 - 2011\n*''new contrast South African Literary Journal'' 38.4, No. 152 - Summer 2010\n*''The Nashwaak Review'' 24-25, No. 1 - Summer/Fall 2010\n*''Prairie Fire'' 31, No. 3 - Fall 2010\n*''Poetry New Zealand'' 41 - September 2010\n*''Windsor Review'' 42, No. - 2009\n\n==Selected awards and honours==\n*Haiku included on the Going to Mars Contest DVD aboard NASA's MAVEN spacecraft to the planet Mars<ref>http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/maven/2013/07/15/public-voting-opens-on-maven-haiku-contest/.

It culminates in a philosophical examination of mankind's place in the universe with Carr's signature poem, \"I Am\".<ref name=\"parl.ca\">{{cite web|url=https://bdp.parl.ca/About/Parliament/Poet/poem-selected-former-poet-laureate2-e.html?id=1&id4=254|title=The Parliamentary Poet Laureate|website=Bdp.parl.ca|accessdate=6 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe imagery in ''Shards of Crystal'' parallels the darkness-to-light chronology of Carr's poems. This transition is essentially a redemptive move both literally and metaphorically, reconciling the pain of \"Shards\" at the outset of the book with the beauty and enlightenment of \"Crystal\" at the conclusion. Beginning with the darkness of night and becoming progressively lighter, her poems ultimately achieve the illumination of the eternal. This is in keeping with the overarching theme of hope as expressed by the Victor Hugo quote at the start of the book: \"Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hugo |first1=Victor |title=Les Mis\u00e9rables |date=1987 |publisher=Signet Classics |isbn=9780451525260 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/lesmisrablessign00vict }}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\nCarr has been published extensively worldwide in Australia, Austria, Canada, China, Cyprus, Finland, France, Holland, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Malawi, Mauritius, Mayotte Island, Mexico, Morocco, Nepal, New Zealand, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Romania, Seychelles, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom (in England, Scotland and Wales) and USA.\n\nAdditionally, she has written literary non-fiction articles which have been published in the Federation of BC Writers ''WordWorks Magazine'' (2020) and ''Part of the Discourse: An Interdisciplinary Humanities Journal'' (2019).\n\n===Books===\n*''Shards of Crystal'' (Silver Bow Publishing, 2018) {{ISBN|978-1-927616-96-3}}\n\n===Selected anthologies===\n*''Dreamscapes'' - 2019\n*''Lost and Found'' - 2019\n*''Celestial Musings'' - 2018\n*''Climate of Opinion'' - 2017\n*''Nuclear Impact: Broken Atoms in Our Hands'' - 2017\n*''Fire and Sky'' - 2016\n*''Memory and Loss'' - 2016\n*''Childhood Regained'' - 2016\n*''Amsterdam Quarterly 2015 Yearbook'' - 2015\n*''Contemporary Poetry - An Anthology of Present Day Best Poems'' Vol. 2 - 2015\n*''Love Where the Nights are Twice as Long'' - 2015\n*''A Quiet Shelter There'' - 2015\n*''Storm Cycle 2013 - The Best of Kind of a Hurricane Press'' - 2014\n*''The Body Electric'' - 2013\n*''Voices Israel'' - 2012\n*''Sol: English Writing in Mexico'' - 2012\n*''Butterfly Away'' - 2011\n*''Van Gogh's Ear'' 7 - 2010\n\n===Selected journals===\n*''The Laurel Review'' 51.2 - 2018\n*''The London Reader'' - Autumn, 2017\n*''The Caf\u00e9 Review'' 27 - Winter, 2016\n*''Slant'' - Summer, 2015\n*''Pasque Petals'' - Fall 2015\n*''Whole Terrain'' 21 - 2014\n*''Zona de Carga'' No. 6 - August 2014\n*''MaLa - The Chengdu Bookworm Literary Journal'' 3 - June 2013\n*''Legal Studies Forum'' XXXVII, No. 1 - 2013\n*''phati'tude Literary Magazine'' 3, No. 3 - Fall 2011\n*''The Toronto Quarterly'' 8 - Nov. 2011\n*''White Wall Review'' 135 - 2011\n*''new contrast South African Literary Journal'' 38.4, No. 152 - Summer 2010\n*''The Nashwaak Review'' 24-25, No. 1 - Summer/Fall 2010\n*''Prairie Fire'' 31, No. 3 - Fall 2010\n*''Poetry New Zealand'' 41 - September 2010\n*''Windsor Review'' 42, No. - 2009\n\n==Selected awards and honours==\n*Haiku included on the Going to Mars Contest DVD aboard NASA's MAVEN spacecraft to the planet Mars<ref>http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/maven/2013/07/15/public-voting-opens-on-maven-haiku-contest/.

The March 1942 issue of the ''British Journal of Nursing'' recorded that:\n<blockquote>\nMiss Mary Hilliard, a gentle, very valiant suffragette, has bestowed as a gift to the College the fine linen handkerchief, signed by and embroidered by all the gallant women who suffered imprisonment for conscience sake, in support of the enfranchisement of women in Holloway prison in March 1912. It displays 67 signatures embroidered in various colours, and all that remains is to offer a warm vote of thanks to Miss Mary Hilliard, R.B.N.A., and to await the time when this historic gift can be suitably framed and placed in the History Section of the British College of Nurses, where its unique value will be appreciated.\u2019<ref>[https://womanandhersphere.com/2016/05/26/suffrage-stories-the-mystery-of-nurse-pines-medal/ Suffrage Stories: The Mystery of Nurse Pine\u2019s Medal - Woman and Her Sphere]</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nOf the 66 women whose full names appear on the handkerchief, 61 are known to have been arrested on the window-smashing campaign of March 1912 and who received prison sentences ranging from two  to six months. Sixteen of the women held positions in local branches of the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] in 1912 while 18 had served earlier sentences prison for their actions on behalf of [[women's suffrage]], while at least four were arrested subsequently. Twenty-four of the women on the handkerchief took part in the [[hunger strike]]s of 1912 and fifteen were [[Force-feeding|forcibly-fed]].<ref name=Sussex/> These women received the [[Hunger Strike Medal]] from the leadership of the WSPU.\n\n==Later ownership and exhibition==\nIt is not known how the Handkerchief came to leave the collection of the British College of Nurses after it closed in 1956 or how it came to be found in the 1960s at a jumble sale at [[West Hoathly]] by Dora Arnold, custodian of the Priest House.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rise up, women! : the remarkable lives of the suffragettes|last=Atkinson|first=Diane|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2018|isbn=9781408844045|location=London|pages=291|oclc=1016848621}}</ref><ref>Diane Atkinson, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8Ng3DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT197&lpg=PT197&dq ''Rise Up Women!: The Remarkable Lives of the Suffragettes''], Bloomsbury Publishing (2018) - Google Books</ref> Its link to the village of West Hoathly is not clear (although an owner of the Priest House in the early 20th-century John Godwin King's daughter Ursula was a member of the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] <ref>{{cite book|title=John Godwin King CBE|publisher=Sussex Past}}</ref>) and research is ongoing.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Suffragette Handkerchief|publisher=Sussex Past}}</ref> The list of the signatories and some notes on their activism is available.<ref name=Sussex>{{Cite web|url=https://sussexpast.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Priest-House-suffragette-handkerchief.pdf|title=Priest House Suffragette Handkerchief|last=|first=|date=|website=Priest House|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Suffragette Handkerchief is displayed on the first floor of the [[The Priest House, West Hoathly]].

{"title_page": "Psychiatric disorders of childbirth", "text_new": "'''Psychiatric disorders of childbirth''' are [[mental disorders]] developed by the mother related to the delivery process itself. They overlap with the organic [[pregnancy|prepartum]] and [[postpartum]] psychoses and other psychiatric conditions associated with having children. Symptoms include rage, or in rare cases, [[neonaticide]].<ref>Brockington I F (2006), Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium.  Bredenbury, Eyry Press, chapter 3.</ref>\n\nThere are many distinct forms of [[psychosis]] which start during [[pregnancy]] (prepartum) or after delivery (postpartum).  In [[Europe]] and [[North America]], only one \u2013 polymorphic psychosis ([[postpartum psychosis]])\u2013 is commonly seen. Postpartum bipolar disorder, referred to in the DSM-5 as bipolar, peripartum onset, is a separate condition with no psychotic features. Historically, about one quarter of psychoses after childbirth were 'organic' and would now be classified as a form of delirium.<ref>Brockington I F (2006) Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium. Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 323-325.</ref>  This means that a severe mental disturbance, usually in the form of [[delirium]], develops as a complication of a [[somatic illness]].<ref>Lishman W A (1997) Organic Psychiatry, 3rd edition. Oxford, Blackwell.</ref>  \n\n==Tocophobia==\n{{main|Tocophobia}}\nThe word comes from the Greek ''tokos'', meaning parturition.  Early authors like Ideler<ref>Ideler K W (1856)  \u00dcber den Wahnsinn der Schwangeren. Charit\u00e9-Annalen 7: 28-47.</ref>  wrote about this fear, and, in 1937, Binder<ref>Binder H (1937) Psychiatrische Untersuchungen \u00fcber die Folgen der operativen Sterilisierung der Frau durch partielle Tubenresektion. Schweizer Archiv f\u00fcr Neurologie und Psychiatrie 40: 1-49.</ref> drew attention to a group of women who sought [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] because of tocophobia. In the last 40 years there have been a series of papers published mainly from [[Scandinavia]]. Tocophobia can be primary (before the first child is born) or secondary (typically after extremely traumatic deliveries). Elective [[Caesarean section]] is one solution, but [[psychotherapy]] can also help these women to give birth [[Vaginal childbirth|vaginally]].<ref>Nerum H, Halvorsen L, S\u00f8rile T, \u00d8ian P (2006) Maternal request for Cesarean section due to fear of birth: can it be changed through crisis-orientated counseling? Birth 33: 221-228.</ref>\n\n==Delirium during labour==\nUnder the name \u2018parturient delirium\u2019, this is defined <ref>Brockington I F (2017) The Psychoses of Menstruation and Childbearing.  Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, pages 94-100. </ref> as an acute (usually sudden) clouding of consciousness, lasting minutes or hours, with full recovery.  Onset is usually towards the end of labour, and recovery after the birth.  Any of the following may be observed \u2013 incoherent speech, misidentification of persons, visual hallucinations, inappropriate behaviour such as singing, or memory loss for the episode.  A phasic course, with alternate delirium and clarity, continuation into the puerperium, and recurrence after another pregnancy have been described in a few cases.\n\nIt was one of the first psychiatric disorders, related to childbearing, to be described <ref> Kirkland T (1774) Treatise on childbed fevers and on the methods of preventing them.  London, Baldwin and Dawson, pages 60-62. </ref>, and its importance in the early 19th century is indicated by an early classification, stating that it was one of two recognized forms of puerperal insanity <ref> Reid J (1848) On the causes, symptoms and treatment of puerperal insanity.  Journal of Psychological Medicine 1: 128-151. </ref>.  More than 50 cases have been described, most of them in the epoch when parturition was endured without effective pain relief.  The disorder has almost disappeared in nations with advanced obstetrics, with only two early 20th century reports <ref> Pollack (1929) Psychosisok a terhess\u00e9g, sz\u00fcl\u00e9s \u00e9s gyermek\u00e1gy alatt.  Orvosi Hetilap 44: 1110-1104. </ref> <ref> Ciulla U (1940) Disturbi psichici e psicosi nello stato puerperale.  Monitore Ostetrico-Ginecologico 12: 577-626. </ref>.  But, within the last ten years, there were 28 nations in which fewer than half the births were attended by skilled birth attendants; they included Nigeria, Pakistan, Ethiopia and Bangladesh, each with more than 3 million births/year <ref> Prata N, Passano P, Rowne T, Bell S, Walsh J, Potts M (2011) Where there are (few) skilled birth attendants.  Journal of Health, Population and Nutrition 29: 81-91. </ref> .  In 2012, it was estimated that 130-180 million infants would be delivered in the quinquennium 2011-2015 without skilled birth attendance <ref> Crowe S, Utley M, Costello A, Pagel C (2012) How many births in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia will not be attended by a skilled birth attendant between 2011 and 2015?  BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth 12: 4. </ref> . There are still many countries where parturition in the 21st century is like that in Europe in the early 19th century, and women are at risk of becoming delirious during labour. \n\n==Unconscious delivery==\nChildbirth can occur during natural [[sleep]] <ref> Brockington I F (2017) The Psychoses of Menstruation and Childbearing.  Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, page 94. </ref>, and under excessively heavy sedation, including [[alcohol intoxication]] <ref> Clay C (1841) On the prevalence of almost unconscious parturition in manufacturing districts.  Lancet, pages 404-407. </ref>.  A diverse list of medical disorders have led to delivery during [[coma]], including [[head injury]], [[antepartum bleeding]], severe [[hypotension]] and [[hypothermia]] <ref> Brockington I F (2017) The Psychoses of Menstruation and Childbearing.  Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, page 104. </ref>. Of these the commonest is [[eclampsia]] <ref> Brockington I F (2017) The Psychoses of Menstruation and Childbearing.  Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, pages 101 & 103. </ref>.  There are ten cases in the literature of unexplained [[stupor]] or coma, including cases with features of [[catatonia]] <ref> Van Rooy (1908) Een geval van bewusteloosheid tijdens de baring. Verslag van het behandelde in de Vergarderomgem vam Januari to Mei 1908, der Nederlandsche Gynaecologische Vereeniging te Amsterdam door Dr. Catharine van Tussenbroek.  Nederlander Tijdschrift voor Verloskunde en Gynaecologie 18: 284-287. </ref>. \n \n==Acts of desperation==\nIn women facing death during [[obstructed labour]], [[panic]] or despair can drive them to take desperate remedies.  There are about twenty cases of [[suicide attempts]] or completed [[suicide]] <ref> Brockington I F (2017) The Psychoses of Menstruation and Childbearing.  Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, page 114.</ref>.  The suicidal motive is not depression or [[shame]], but unbearable pain and despair.  The methods \u2013 throwing themselves out of the window, hanging or drowning \u2013 show the extremity of the mother\u2019s suffering.\n\nThere are more than 20 descriptions of auto-Caesarean section <ref> Szabo A, Brockington I F (2014) Auto-Caesarean section: a review of 22 cases. Archives of Women\u2019s Mental Health 17: 79-81.</ref>.  In a few cases the apparent motive has been the destruction of an unwanted child, or psychiatric illness, but the majority have been desperate remedies when the infant cannot be delivered and the nearest obstetric unit was beyond reach.  Most of these cases have been reported from poor countries, where contributions to literature are scarce, and they may be more common there.  The mother usually survives, but few infants survive.\n\n==Psychosis during labour==\nVarious psychoses can start during labour <ref> Brockington I F (2017) The Psychoses of Menstruation and Childbearing.  Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, pages 115-116.</ref>.  Of the organic psychoses, eclamptic, Donkin, epileptic and infective psychoses have all started during labour, although postpartum onset is usual.  These differ from parturient delirium in their duration, lasting at least a few days, not a few hours.  In addition, there are 19 cases of bipolar episodes with onset during labour; they differ from parturient delirium in their symptomatology (mania rather than delirium) and a duration measured in weeks.  These cases are evidence that, on the balance of probability, the trigger of bipolar/cycloid episodes is already active during parturition.\n\n==Pathological mental states immediately after the birth==\n\nImmediately after the birth, an exhausted mother, fainting or in shock, may not be able to care for the new-born, who often needs resuscitation, and can suffocate in mucus or blood. Exhaustion alone, without syncope or delirium, can prevent a mother from helping a dying infant; in clandestine labours, it can be fatal to the new-born, without [[mens rea]].  \n\nBrief states of delirium have been described with onset after the birth, less common but similar to those that occur during parturition.  There are about 20 in the literature <ref> Brockington I F (2017) The Psychoses of Menstruation and Childbearing.  Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, pages 118-119. </ref>.  Several of them have been accompanied by violence, and, after recovery a few hours later, followed by amnesia.  Occasionally mothers have had recurrent episodes.  \n \nPostpartum [[stupor]] has been described <ref> Kelso J (1840) Nervous exhaustion dependent on and complicating the puerperal state with cases.  Lancet i: 945-948.</ref> <ref> Tott C A (1844) F\u00e4lle von ''melancholia attonita'' bei Neuenbunderen.  Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Geburtskunde 16: 187-190.</ref>, beginning immediately or very shortly after the birth.   The mother remains speechless, immobile and unresponsive to any stimuli for hours or even a day or more <ref> Brockington I F (2017) The Psychoses of Menstruation and Childbearing.  Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, pages 119-122. </ref>.  These stupors differ in duration and clinical features from postpartum bipolar disorder. They have been phasic, with recovery and relapse.  Their cause is unknown. \n\n==Childbirth-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)==\n{{anchor|Postpartum PTSD}}\n{{main|Childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder}}\nPostpartum PTSD was first described in 1978.<ref>Bydlowski M, Raoul-Duval A (1978) Un avatar psychique m\u00e9connu de la puerperalit\u00e9: la n\u00e9vrose traumatique post obst\u00e9tricale.  Perspectives Psychiatriques 4: 321-328.</ref>  Since then over 60 papers have been published.  After excessively painful labours, or those with a disturbing loss of control, fear of [[stillbirth]] or complications requiring emergency Caesarean section, some mothers suffer [[nightmare]]s, and [[Intrusive thoughts|intrusive images and memories]] ('[[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]]s'), similar to those occurring after other harrowing experiences.  They can last for months.<ref>S\u00f6derquist J, Wijma B, Wijma K (2006) The longitudinal course of post-traumatic stress after childbirth.  Journal of Psychosomatic Obstetrics and Gynaecology 27: 113-119.</ref>  Some avoid further pregnancy (secondary tocophobia), and those who become pregnant again may experience a return of symptoms, especially in the last [[Pregnancy#Physiology|trimester]].  Rates up to 5.9% of deliveries have been reported.<ref>Adewuya A O, Ologun Y A, Ibigbami O S (2006)  Post-traumatic stress disorder after childbirth in Nigerian women: prevalence and risk factors.  British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology 113: 284-288.</ref>  There is some evidence that early [[counseling]] reduces these symptoms.  Enduring symptoms require specific psychological treatment.\n\n==Delirium==\n===Infective delirium===\nPostpartum infective delirium was described by [[Hippocrates]]:<ref>Hippocrates (5th century BC) Epidemics, volume 1, and Aphorisms, volume 4, in the edition translated by W H S Jones (1931).  London, Heineman.</ref> 8/17 female cases in the 1st and 3rd books of epidemics suffered from postpartum or post-abortion sepsis, all complicated by delirium.  In Europe and North America the foundation of the metropolitan maternity hospitals, together with instrumental deliveries and the practice of attending [[Necropsy|necropsies]], led to [[epidemic]]s of streptococcal puerperal fever, resulting in maternal mortality rates up to 10%.  The peak was about 1870, after which [[antisepsis]] and [[asepsis]] gradually brought them under control.  These severe infections were often complicated by delirium, but it was not until the [[Nosology|nosological]] advances of [[Chaslin]] <ref>Chaslin P (1895) Confusion Mentale Primitive, Stupidit\u00e9, D\u00e9mence aigu\u00eb, Stupeur Primitive. Paris, Harmattan.</ref> and Bonh\u00f6ffer <ref>Bonh\u00f6ffer K (1910) Die symptomatischen Psychosen im Gefolge von akuten Infektionen und inneren Erkrankungen. Leipzig and Wien, Deutlicke.</ref> that they could be distinguished from other causes of postpartum psychosis.  Infective delirium hardly ever starts during pregnancy, and usually begins in the first postpartum week.  The onset of [[sepsis]] and delirium are closely related, and the course parallels the infection, although about 20% of patients recover from the infection, but develop chronic confusional states.  Recurrences after another pregnancy are rare.\n\n===Ethanol withdrawal===\nAlcohol withdrawal states ([[delirium tremens]]) are recognized in addicts whose intake has been interrupted by trauma or surgery. This can occur after childbirth.\n\n===Wernicke-Korsakoff psychosis===\nA severe mental disorder was described by Wernicke <ref>Wernicke C (1881) Lehrbuch der Gehirnkrankheiten f\u00fcr \u00c4ezte und Studirende, volume 2. Kassel & Berlin, Fischer, pages 229-242.</ref> and Korsakoff.<ref>Korsakow S S (1887) \u00dcber eine besonderer Form psychischer St\u00f6rung. Archiv f\u00fcr Psychiatrie21: 671-704.</ref>  Its most striking feature is [[Amnesia|loss of memory]], which can be permanent.  The cause is vitamin B<sub>1</sub> ([[thiamine]]) deficiency, usually found in severe [[alcoholic]]s.  It can also result from pernicious vomiting of pregnancy ([[hyperemesis gravidarum]]).  Over 125 cases have been reported in the world literature and, although thiamine treatment has been available since 1936,<ref>Brockington I F (2006) Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium. Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 23-49.</ref> these cases still occur in countries with advanced medical services, due to rehydration without vitamin supplements.  A few patients have developed symptoms after the death of the [[foetus]], miscarriage, termination of pregnancy or delivery.\n\n===Water intoxication===\n[[Hyponatraemia]] (which leads to delirium) can complicate [[oxytocin]] treatment, usually when given to induce an abortion.<ref>Brockington I F (2006) Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium. Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 287-288.</ref>\n\n===Hyperammonaemia===\nInborn errors of the [[Krebs-Henseleit urea cycle]] lead to [[hyperammonaemia]].  In carriers and [[heterozygote]]s, [[encephalopathy]] can develop in pregnancy or the puerperium.  Cases have been described in [[carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1]], [[argino-succinate synthetase]] and [[ornithine carbamoyltransferase]] deficiency.<ref>Brockington I F (2006) Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium. Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 289-293.</ref>  This is the form of postpartum psychosis most recently described.<ref>Yamada N, Fukui M, Ishii K, Shibata H, Okabe H, Ohomiya H, Matsunobu A, Nishizima M 1980) A case of adult form hypercitrullinemia with consciousness disturbance and marked hypertransaminasenemia after delivery. Nihon Shokakibyo Gakkae Zasshi 77: 1655-1660.</ref>\n\n===Chorea gravidarum===\nBefore the advent of antibiotics, [[Streptococcus|streptococcal]] infections occasionally led to a condition called ''Chorea gravidarum''. Chorea gravidarum, a severe variant of Sydenham's chorea, can have a number of [[psychiatric]] complications \u2013 character change, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[Tourette's syndrome]],<ref>Sandras C M S, Bourgignon H (1860) Trait\u00e9 Pratique des Maladies Nerveuses. Paris, Germer-Bailli\u00e8re, pages 397-411.</ref> hypnogogic hallucinations,<ref>Marc\u00e9 L V (1860) L'\u00c9tat mental dans la chor\u00e9e.

Th\u00e8se, Paris, no. 124.</ref> But it still occurs as a result of systemic [[lupus]] or anti-phospholipid syndromes. Nevertheless, chorea psychoses are very rare, with only about 50 prepartum cases reported in the literature.  Occasionally, they can break out after delivery, or after a [[Abortion|termination of pregnancy]].<ref>Brockington I F (2006) Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium. Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 1-23.</ref>\n\n===Incidental causes===\nAll the above causes have a specific connection with childbearing.  But diseases that have no such connection can fortuitously lead to postpartum psychosis, for example [[neurosyphilis]], [[encephalitis]], [[meningitis]], [[thyroid disease]] or [[ischaemic heart disease]].<ref>Brockington I F (2006) Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium. Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 301-319.</ref>\n\n==Vascular problems==\n===Cerebral venous thrombosis===\nPuerperal women are liable to [[thrombosis]], especially [[thrombophlebitis]] of the leg and pelvic veins.  Aseptic thrombi can also form in the dural venous [[sinus (anatomy)|sinus]]es and the cerebral veins draining into them.  Most patients present with [[headache]], vomiting, seizures and focal signs such as [[hemiplegia]] or [[dysphasia]], but a minority of cases have a psychiatric presentation.<ref>Kalbag R M, Woolf A L (1967) Cerebral Venous Thrombosis, with Special Reference to Primary Aseptic Thrombosis. Oxford, Oxford University Press.</ref>  The [[Cumulative incidence|incidence]] is about 10/10,000 births in Europe and North America,<ref>Lanska D J, Kryscio R J (2000) Risk factors for peripartum and postpartum stroke and intracranial venous thrombosis. Stroke 31: 1274-1282.</ref> but much higher in [[India]], where large series have been collected.<ref>Srinavasan K (1988) Puerperal cerebral venous and arterial thrombosis. Seminars in Neurology 8:222-225.</ref>\n\n===Hypopituitarism===\n[[Pituatary gland|Pituitary]] necrosis following postpartum haemorrhage ([[Sheehan's syndrome]]) leads to failure and [[atrophy]] of the [[gonads]], [[adrenal]] and [[thyroid]].  Chronic psychoses can supervene many years later, based on [[myxoedema]], [[hypoglycaemia]] or [[Addisonian crisis]].  But these patients can also develop acute and recurrent psychoses, even as early as the puerperium.<ref>Brockington I F (2006) Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium. Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 279-286.</ref>\n\n===Other vascular disorders===\nArterial occlusion may be due to [[Thrombus|thrombi]], amniotic fragments or air [[embolism]].  Postpartum cerebral [[angiopathy]] is a transitory arterial spasm of medium caliber cerebral arteries; it was first described in [[cocaine]] and [[amphetamine]] addicts, but can also complicate [[ergot]] and [[bromocriptine]] prescribed to inhibit [[lactation]].   [[Subarachnoid haemorrhage]] can occur after miscarriage or childbirth.  [[Epidural anaesthesia]] can, if the [[dura mater|dura]] is punctured, lead to leakage of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] and subdural [[haematoma]].<ref>Jack T M (1982) Post-partum intracranial subdural haematoma.  A possible complication of epidural analgesia.

Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 271-275.</ref>\n\n==International perspective on organic psychoses==\nWith the great improvement in obstetric care, severe complications of pregnancy and childbirth have become rare. There is, however, a great contrast between Europe, North America, Australia, Japan and some other countries with advanced medical care, and the rest of the world. The wealthiest nations produce only 10 million children each year, from a total of 135 million. They have a maternal mortality rate (MMR) of 6\u201320/100,000.  Some poorer nations with high birth rates have an MMR more than 100 times as high,<ref>Hill K, AbouZahr C, Wardlaw T (2001) Estimates of maternal mortality for 1995.  Bulletin of the World Health Organization 79: 182-192.</ref> and, presumably, a corresponding prevalence of severe morbidity.  For example, in Sub-Saharan Africa, 21 nations, with a combined birth rate of over 14 million, have an MMR >1,000/100,000.  Only a minority of deliveries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are attended by skilled personnel ([[Physician|doctors]], [[nurse]]s or [[midwive]]s).<ref>AbouZahr C, Wardlaw T (2001) Maternal mortality at the end of the decade. Bulletin or the World Health Organization 79: 561-573.</ref>  In [[Dar es Salaam]], the majority of postpartum psychoses are organic.<ref>Ndosi N K, Mtawali M L, 2002) The nature of puerperal psychosis at Muhimbili National Hospital: its physical co-morbidity, associated main obstetric and social factors.

They overlap with the organic [[pregnancy|prepartum]] and [[postpartum]] psychoses and other psychiatric conditions associated with having children. Symptoms include rage, or in rare cases, [[neonaticide]].<ref>Brockington I F (2006), Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium.  Bredenbury, Eyry Press, chapter 3.</ref>\n\nThere are many distinct forms of [[psychosis]] which start during [[pregnancy]] (prepartum) or after delivery (postpartum).  In [[Europe]] and [[North America]], only one \u2013 polymorphic psychosis ([[postpartum psychosis]])\u2013 is commonly seen. Postpartum bipolar disorder, referred to in the DSM-5 as bipolar, peripartum onset, is a separate condition with no psychotic features. Historically, about one quarter of psychoses after childbirth were 'organic' and would now be classified as a form of delirium.<ref>Brockington I F (2006) Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium. Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 323-325.</ref>  This means that a severe mental disturbance, usually in the form of [[delirium]], develops as a complication of a [[somatic illness]].<ref>Lishman W A (1997) Organic Psychiatry, 3rd edition. Oxford, Blackwell.</ref>  \n\n==Tocophobia==\n{{main|Tocophobia}}\nThe word comes from the Greek ''tokos'', meaning parturition.  Early authors like Ideler<ref>Ideler K W (1856)  \u00dcber den Wahnsinn der Schwangeren. Charit\u00e9-Annalen 7: 28-47.</ref>  wrote about this fear, and, in 1937, Binder<ref>Binder H (1937) Psychiatrische Untersuchungen \u00fcber die Folgen der operativen Sterilisierung der Frau durch partielle Tubenresektion. Schweizer Archiv f\u00fcr Neurologie und Psychiatrie 40: 1-49.</ref> drew attention to a group of women who sought [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] because of tocophobia. In the last 40 years there have been a series of papers published mainly from [[Scandinavia]]. Tocophobia can be primary (before the first child is born) or secondary (typically after extremely traumatic deliveries). Elective [[Caesarean section]] is one solution, but [[psychotherapy]] can also help these women to give birth [[Vaginal childbirth|vaginally]].<ref>Nerum H, Halvorsen L, S\u00f8rile T, \u00d8ian P (2006) Maternal request for Cesarean section due to fear of birth: can it be changed through crisis-orientated counseling? Birth 33: 221-228.</ref>\n\n==Delirium during labour==\nUnder the name \u2018parturient delirium\u2019, this is defined <ref>Brockington I F (2017) The Psychoses of Menstruation and Childbearing.  Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, pages 94-100. </ref> as an acute (usually sudden) clouding of consciousness, lasting minutes or hours, with full recovery.  Onset is usually towards the end of labour, and recovery after the birth.  Any of the following may be observed \u2013 incoherent speech, misidentification of persons, visual hallucinations, inappropriate behaviour such as singing, or memory loss for the episode.  A phasic course, with alternate delirium and clarity, continuation into the puerperium, and recurrence after another pregnancy have been described in a few cases.\n\nIt was one of the first psychiatric disorders, related to childbearing, to be described <ref> Kirkland T (1774) Treatise on childbed fevers and on the methods of preventing them.  London, Baldwin and Dawson, pages 60-62. </ref>, and its importance in the early 19th century is indicated by an early classification, stating that it was one of two recognized forms of puerperal insanity <ref> Reid J (1848) On the causes, symptoms and treatment of puerperal insanity.  Journal of Psychological Medicine 1: 128-151. </ref>.  More than 50 cases have been described, most of them in the epoch when parturition was endured without effective pain relief.  The disorder has almost disappeared in nations with advanced obstetrics, with only two early 20th century reports <ref> Pollack (1929) Psychosisok a terhess\u00e9g, sz\u00fcl\u00e9s \u00e9s gyermek\u00e1gy alatt.  Orvosi Hetilap 44: 1110-1104. </ref> <ref> Ciulla U (1940) Disturbi psichici e psicosi nello stato puerperale.  Monitore Ostetrico-Ginecologico 12: 577-626. </ref>.  But, within the last ten years, there were 28 nations in which fewer than half the births were attended by skilled birth attendants; they included Nigeria, Pakistan, Ethiopia and Bangladesh, each with more than 3 million births/year <ref> Prata N, Passano P, Rowne T, Bell S, Walsh J, Potts M (2011) Where there are (few) skilled birth attendants.  Journal of Health, Population and Nutrition 29: 81-91. </ref> .  In 2012, it was estimated that 130-180 million infants would be delivered in the quinquennium 2011-2015 without skilled birth attendance <ref> Crowe S, Utley M, Costello A, Pagel C (2012) How many births in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia will not be attended by a skilled birth attendant between 2011 and 2015?  BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth 12: 4. </ref> . There are still many countries where parturition in the 21st century is like that in Europe in the early 19th century, and women are at risk of becoming delirious during labour. \n\n==Unconscious delivery==\nChildbirth can occur during natural [[sleep]] <ref> Brockington I F (2017) The Psychoses of Menstruation and Childbearing.  Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, page 94. </ref>, and under excessively heavy sedation, including [[alcohol intoxication]] <ref> Clay C (1841) On the prevalence of almost unconscious parturition in manufacturing districts.  Lancet, pages 404-407. </ref>.  A diverse list of medical disorders have led to delivery during [[coma]], including [[head injury]], [[antepartum bleeding]], severe [[hypotension]] and [[hypothermia]] <ref> Brockington I F (2017) The Psychoses of Menstruation and Childbearing.  Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, page 104. </ref>. Of these the commonest is [[eclampsia]] <ref> Brockington I F (2017) The Psychoses of Menstruation and Childbearing.  Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, pages 101 & 103. </ref>.  There are ten cases in the literature of unexplained [[stupor]] or coma, including cases with features of [[catatonia]] <ref> Van Rooy (1908) Een geval van bewusteloosheid tijdens de baring. Verslag van het behandelde in de Vergarderomgem vam Januari to Mei 1908, der Nederlandsche Gynaecologische Vereeniging te Amsterdam door Dr. Catharine van Tussenbroek.  Nederlander Tijdschrift voor Verloskunde en Gynaecologie 18: 284-287. </ref>. \n \n==Acts of desperation==\nIn women facing death during [[obstructed labour]], [[panic]] or despair can drive them to take desperate remedies.  There are about twenty cases of [[suicide attempts]] or completed [[suicide]] <ref> Brockington I F (2017) The Psychoses of Menstruation and Childbearing.  Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, page 114.</ref>.  The suicidal motive is not depression or [[shame]], but unbearable pain and despair.  The methods \u2013 throwing themselves out of the window, hanging or drowning \u2013 show the extremity of the mother\u2019s suffering.\n\nThere are more than 20 descriptions of auto-Caesarean section <ref> Szabo A, Brockington I F (2014) Auto-Caesarean section: a review of 22 cases. Archives of Women\u2019s Mental Health 17: 79-81.</ref>.  In a few cases the apparent motive has been the destruction of an unwanted child, or psychiatric illness, but the majority have been desperate remedies when the infant cannot be delivered and the nearest obstetric unit was beyond reach.  Most of these cases have been reported from poor countries, where contributions to literature are scarce, and they may be more common there.  The mother usually survives, but few infants survive.\n\n==Psychosis during labour==\nVarious psychoses can start during labour <ref> Brockington I F (2017) The Psychoses of Menstruation and Childbearing.  Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, pages 115-116.</ref>.  Of the organic psychoses, eclamptic, Donkin, epileptic and infective psychoses have all started during labour, although postpartum onset is usual.  These differ from parturient delirium in their duration, lasting at least a few days, not a few hours.  In addition, there are 19 cases of bipolar episodes with onset during labour; they differ from parturient delirium in their symptomatology (mania rather than delirium) and a duration measured in weeks.  These cases are evidence that, on the balance of probability, the trigger of bipolar/cycloid episodes is already active during parturition.\n\n==Pathological mental states immediately after the birth==\n\nImmediately after the birth, an exhausted mother, fainting or in shock, may not be able to care for the new-born, who often needs resuscitation, and can suffocate in mucus or blood. Exhaustion alone, without [[syncope]] or delirium, can prevent a mother from helping a dying infant; in clandestine labours, it can be fatal to the new-born, without [[mens rea]].  \n\nBrief states of delirium have been described with onset after the birth, less common but similar to those that occur during parturition.  There are about 20 in the literature <ref> Brockington I F (2017) The Psychoses of Menstruation and Childbearing.  Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, pages 118-119. </ref>.  Several of them have been accompanied by violence, and, after recovery a few hours later, followed by amnesia.  Occasionally mothers have had recurrent episodes.  \n \nPostpartum [[stupor]] has been described <ref> Kelso J (1840) Nervous exhaustion dependent on and complicating the puerperal state with cases.  Lancet i: 945-948.</ref> <ref> Tott C A (1844) F\u00e4lle von ''melancholia attonita'' bei Neuenbunderen.  Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Geburtskunde 16: 187-190.</ref>, beginning immediately or very shortly after the birth.   The mother remains speechless, immobile and unresponsive to any stimuli for hours or even a day or more <ref> Brockington I F (2017) The Psychoses of Menstruation and Childbearing.  Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, pages 119-122. </ref>.  These stupors differ in duration and clinical features from postpartum bipolar disorder. They have been phasic, with recovery and relapse.  Their cause is unknown. \n\n==Childbirth-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)==\n{{anchor|Postpartum PTSD}}\n{{main|Childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder}}\nPostpartum PTSD was first described in 1978.<ref>Bydlowski M, Raoul-Duval A (1978) Un avatar psychique m\u00e9connu de la puerperalit\u00e9: la n\u00e9vrose traumatique post obst\u00e9tricale.  Perspectives Psychiatriques 4: 321-328.</ref>  Since then over 60 papers have been published.  After excessively painful labours, or those with a disturbing loss of control, fear of [[stillbirth]] or complications requiring emergency Caesarean section, some mothers suffer [[nightmare]]s, and [[Intrusive thoughts|intrusive images and memories]] ('[[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]]s'), similar to those occurring after other harrowing experiences.  They can last for months.<ref>S\u00f6derquist J, Wijma B, Wijma K (2006) The longitudinal course of post-traumatic stress after childbirth.  Journal of Psychosomatic Obstetrics and Gynaecology 27: 113-119.</ref>  Some avoid further pregnancy (secondary tocophobia), and those who become pregnant again may experience a return of symptoms, especially in the last [[Pregnancy#Physiology|trimester]].  Rates up to 5.9% of deliveries have been reported.<ref>Adewuya A O, Ologun Y A, Ibigbami O S (2006)  Post-traumatic stress disorder after childbirth in Nigerian women: prevalence and risk factors.  British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology 113: 284-288.</ref>  There is some evidence that early [[counseling]] reduces these symptoms.  Enduring symptoms require specific psychological treatment.\n\n==Delirium==\n===Infective delirium===\nPostpartum infective delirium was described by [[Hippocrates]]:<ref>Hippocrates (5th century BC) Epidemics, volume 1, and Aphorisms, volume 4, in the edition translated by W H S Jones (1931).  London, Heineman.</ref> 8/17 female cases in the 1st and 3rd books of epidemics suffered from postpartum or post-abortion sepsis, all complicated by delirium.  In Europe and North America the foundation of the metropolitan maternity hospitals, together with instrumental deliveries and the practice of attending [[Necropsy|necropsies]], led to [[epidemic]]s of streptococcal puerperal fever, resulting in maternal mortality rates up to 10%.  The peak was about 1870, after which [[antisepsis]] and [[asepsis]] gradually brought them under control.  These severe infections were often complicated by delirium, but it was not until the [[Nosology|nosological]] advances of [[Chaslin]] <ref>Chaslin P (1895) Confusion Mentale Primitive, Stupidit\u00e9, D\u00e9mence aigu\u00eb, Stupeur Primitive. Paris, Harmattan.</ref> and Bonh\u00f6ffer <ref>Bonh\u00f6ffer K (1910) Die symptomatischen Psychosen im Gefolge von akuten Infektionen und inneren Erkrankungen. Leipzig and Wien, Deutlicke.</ref> that they could be distinguished from other causes of postpartum psychosis.  Infective delirium hardly ever starts during pregnancy, and usually begins in the first postpartum week.  The onset of [[sepsis]] and delirium are closely related, and the course parallels the infection, although about 20% of patients recover from the infection, but develop chronic confusional states.  Recurrences after another pregnancy are rare.\n\n===Ethanol withdrawal===\nAlcohol withdrawal states ([[delirium tremens]]) are recognized in addicts whose intake has been interrupted by trauma or surgery. This can occur after childbirth.\n\n===Wernicke-Korsakoff psychosis===\nA severe mental disorder was described by Wernicke <ref>Wernicke C (1881) Lehrbuch der Gehirnkrankheiten f\u00fcr \u00c4ezte und Studirende, volume 2. Kassel & Berlin, Fischer, pages 229-242.</ref> and Korsakoff.<ref>Korsakow S S (1887) \u00dcber eine besonderer Form psychischer St\u00f6rung. Archiv f\u00fcr Psychiatrie21: 671-704.</ref>  Its most striking feature is [[Amnesia|loss of memory]], which can be permanent.  The cause is vitamin B<sub>1</sub> ([[thiamine]]) deficiency, usually found in severe [[alcoholic]]s.  It can also result from pernicious vomiting of pregnancy ([[hyperemesis gravidarum]]).  Over 125 cases have been reported in the world literature and, although thiamine treatment has been available since 1936,<ref>Brockington I F (2006) Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium. Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 23-49.</ref> these cases still occur in countries with advanced medical services, due to rehydration without vitamin supplements.  A few patients have developed symptoms after the death of the [[foetus]], miscarriage, termination of pregnancy or delivery.\n\n===Water intoxication===\n[[Hyponatraemia]] (which leads to delirium) can complicate [[oxytocin]] treatment, usually when given to induce an abortion.<ref>Brockington I F (2006) Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium. Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 287-288.</ref>\n\n===Hyperammonaemia===\nInborn errors of the [[Krebs-Henseleit urea cycle]] lead to [[hyperammonaemia]].  In carriers and [[heterozygote]]s, [[encephalopathy]] can develop in pregnancy or the puerperium.  Cases have been described in [[carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1]], [[argino-succinate synthetase]] and [[ornithine carbamoyltransferase]] deficiency.<ref>Brockington I F (2006) Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium. Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 289-293.</ref>  This is the form of postpartum psychosis most recently described.<ref>Yamada N, Fukui M, Ishii K, Shibata H, Okabe H, Ohomiya H, Matsunobu A, Nishizima M 1980) A case of adult form hypercitrullinemia with consciousness disturbance and marked hypertransaminasenemia after delivery. Nihon Shokakibyo Gakkae Zasshi 77: 1655-1660.</ref>\n\n===Chorea gravidarum===\nBefore the advent of antibiotics, [[Streptococcus|streptococcal]] infections occasionally led to a condition called ''Chorea gravidarum''. Chorea gravidarum, a severe variant of Sydenham's chorea, can have a number of [[psychiatric]] complications \u2013 character change, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[Tourette's syndrome]],<ref>Sandras C M S, Bourgignon H (1860) Trait\u00e9 Pratique des Maladies Nerveuses.

Th\u00e8se, Paris, no. 124.</ref> But it still occurs as a result of systemic [[lupus]] or anti-phospholipid syndromes. Nevertheless, chorea psychoses are very rare, with only about 50 prepartum cases reported in the literature.  Occasionally, they can break out after delivery, or after a [[Abortion|termination of pregnancy]].<ref>Brockington I F (2006) Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium. Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 1-23.</ref>\n\n===Incidental causes===\nAll the above causes have a specific connection with childbearing.  But diseases that have no such connection can fortuitously lead to postpartum psychosis, for example [[neurosyphilis]], [[encephalitis]], [[meningitis]], [[thyroid disease]] or [[ischaemic heart disease]].<ref>Brockington I F (2006) Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium. Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 301-319.</ref>\n\n==Vascular problems==\n===Cerebral venous thrombosis===\nPuerperal women are liable to [[thrombosis]], especially [[thrombophlebitis]] of the leg and pelvic veins.  Aseptic thrombi can also form in the dural venous [[sinus (anatomy)|sinus]]es and the cerebral veins draining into them.  Most patients present with [[headache]], vomiting, seizures and focal signs such as [[hemiplegia]] or [[dysphasia]], but a minority of cases have a psychiatric presentation.<ref>Kalbag R M, Woolf A L (1967) Cerebral Venous Thrombosis, with Special Reference to Primary Aseptic Thrombosis. Oxford, Oxford University Press.</ref>  The [[Cumulative incidence|incidence]] is about 10/10,000 births in Europe and North America,<ref>Lanska D J, Kryscio R J (2000) Risk factors for peripartum and postpartum stroke and intracranial venous thrombosis. Stroke 31: 1274-1282.</ref> but much higher in [[India]], where large series have been collected.<ref>Srinavasan K (1988) Puerperal cerebral venous and arterial thrombosis. Seminars in Neurology 8:222-225.</ref>\n\n===Hypopituitarism===\n[[Pituatary gland|Pituitary]] necrosis following postpartum haemorrhage ([[Sheehan's syndrome]]) leads to failure and [[atrophy]] of the [[gonads]], [[adrenal]] and [[thyroid]].  Chronic psychoses can supervene many years later, based on [[myxoedema]], [[hypoglycaemia]] or [[Addisonian crisis]].  But these patients can also develop acute and recurrent psychoses, even as early as the puerperium.<ref>Brockington I F (2006) Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium. Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 279-286.</ref>\n\n===Other vascular disorders===\nArterial occlusion may be due to [[Thrombus|thrombi]], amniotic fragments or air [[embolism]].  Postpartum cerebral [[angiopathy]] is a transitory arterial spasm of medium caliber cerebral arteries; it was first described in [[cocaine]] and [[amphetamine]] addicts, but can also complicate [[ergot]] and [[bromocriptine]] prescribed to inhibit [[lactation]].   [[Subarachnoid haemorrhage]] can occur after miscarriage or childbirth.  [[Epidural anaesthesia]] can, if the [[dura mater|dura]] is punctured, lead to leakage of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] and subdural [[haematoma]].<ref>Jack T M (1982) Post-partum intracranial subdural haematoma.  A possible complication of epidural analgesia.  British Medical Journal 285: 972 only.</ref>  All these can occasionally present with psychiatric symptoms.<ref>Brockington I F (2006) Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium. Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 239-267.</ref>\n\n==Epilepsy==\nWomen with a lifelong epileptic history are also liable to psychoses during labour in the [[puerperium]].  Women occasionally develop epilepsy for the first time in relation to their first pregnancy, and psychotic episodes have been described.<ref>Brockington I F (2006) Eileithyia's Mischief: the Organic Psychoses of Pregnancy, Parturition and the Puerperium. Bredenbury, Eyry Press, pages 271-275.</ref>\n\n==International perspective on organic psychoses==\nWith the great improvement in obstetric care, severe complications of pregnancy and childbirth have become rare.

Testing is essential to conducting [[Public health surveillance|community surveillance]] and [[contact tracing]] to measure the spread of the virus and establish local quarantines, preventing further spread. As it typically does, the CDC developed its own test. The CDC test used three genetic sequences or \"probes\", rather than using a German-developed, two-sequence test that the WHO was distributing. However, the CDC test is soon found to be defective, with the third probe giving inconclusive results. The CDC directed state health department labs to send all samples to the CDC lab in Atlanta for evaluation (significantly increasing time to confirm diagnosis), then later to use a workaround, using just two of the three probes and evaluate them locally. By mid-February, the U.S. is still only testing about 100 samples per day, versus thousands per day in other countries. With limited testing capacity, the scope of testing remained extremely narrow. This contributed to the inability to establish effective surveillance and contact tracing programs essential to containing the spread of the virus.

On January 3, the CDC Director Robert Redfield was notified by a counterpart in China that a \"mysterious respiratory illness was spreading in Wuhan [China]\". Redfield notified HHS Secretary [[Alex Azar]] shortly thereafter, who shared his report with the [[National Security Council]] (NSC).

Testing is essential to conducting [[Public health surveillance|community surveillance]] and [[contact tracing]] to measure the spread of the virus and establish local quarantines, preventing further spread. As it typically does, the CDC developed its own test. The CDC test used three genetic sequences or \"probes\", rather than using a German-developed, two-sequence test that the WHO was distributing. However, the CDC test is soon found to be defective, with the third probe giving inconclusive results. The CDC directed state health department labs to initially stop testing, then later to use a workaround, using just two of the three probes. By mid-February, the U.S. is still only testing about 100 samples per day, versus thousands per day in other countries. With limited testing capacity, the scope of testing remained extremely narrow. This contributed to the inability to establish effective surveillance and contact tracing programs essential to containing the spread of the virus. Researchers concluded in late February that \"the virus had probably been [[Transmission (medicine)|spreading]] for weeks\" person-to-person.<ref name=\"NYT_Test1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html|title=The Lost Month:How a Failure to Test Blinded the U.S. to Covid-19|date=March 28, 2020|via=nytimes.com}}</ref>\n\n====January 21-31====\n[[File:Donald Trump Coronavirus briefing.jpg|thumb|President [[Donald Trump]] received a briefing on the coronavirus on January 29, 2020.|alt=]]\n\nThe first reported case in the U.S. was in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] on January 21, 2020, which affected a man who had returned from [[Wuhan]], China.

By the third week of February, the group had \"effectively concluded that the United States had already lost the fight to contain the virus, and that it needed to switch to mitigation\" such as NPI's. This was based on the \"realization that many people in the country were likely infected and capable of spreading the disease, but not showing any symptoms.\"  For instance, by the time of the European travel ban on March 11 (a containment strategy), the group considered such containment steps ineffective.
