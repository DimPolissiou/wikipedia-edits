No work was unworthy or undeserving for him.}}\n\nRubik studied sculpture at the Technical University in Budapest and architecture at the Academy of Applied Arts and Design, also in Budapest. While a professor of design at the academy, he pursued his hobby of building geometric models. One of these was a prototype of his cube, made of 27 wooden blocks; it took Rubik a month to solve the problem of the cube. It proved a useful tool for teaching algebraic group theory, and in late 1977 Konsumex, Hungary's state trading company, began marketing it. By 1980 Rubik's Cube was marketed throughout the world, and over 100 million authorized units, with an estimated 50 million unauthorized imitations, were sold, mostly during its subsequent three years of popularity. Approximately 50 books were published describing how to solve the puzzle of Rubik's Cube. Following his cube's popularity, Rubik opened a studio to develop designs in 1984; among its products was another popular puzzle toy, Rubik's Magic.\n\n===Education===\nFrom 1958 to 1962, Rubik specialised in sculpture at the Secondary School of Fine and Applied Arts. From 1962 to 1967, Rubik attended the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics|Budapest University of Technology]] where he became a member of the Architecture Faculty. From 1967 to 1971, Rubik attended the Hungarian Academy of Applied Arts and was on the Faculty of Interior Architecture and Design.<ref name=\"Rubik Interview\"/>\n\nRubik considers university and the education it afforded him as the decisive event which shaped his life. Rubik has stated that \"Schools offered me the opportunity to acquire knowledge of subjects or rather crafts that need a lot of practice, persistence and diligence with the direction of a mentor.\"<ref name=\"Rubik Interview\"/>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early professorship and birth of Rubik's Cube===\nFrom 1971 to 1979, Rubik was a professor of architecture at the [[Hungarian University of Applied Arts|Budapest College of Applied Arts]] (''Iparm\u0171v\u00e9szeti F\u0151iskola''). It was during his time there that he built designs for a three-dimensional puzzle and completed the first working prototype of the [[Rubik's Cube]] in 1974, applying for a patent on the puzzle in 1975. In an interview with [[CNN]], Rubik stated that he was \"searching to find a good task for my students.\"<ref name=\"CNN\">[http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/10/tech/rubiks-cube-inventor The little cube that changed the world] Retrieved 2013-04-29.</ref>\n\n{{quote|Space always intrigued me, with its incredibly rich possibilities, space alteration by (architectural) objects, objects' transformation in space (sculpture, design), movement in space and in time, their correlation, their repercussion on mankind, the relation between man and space, the object and time.

Rubik originally used wood for the block because of the convenience of a workshop at the university and because he viewed wood as a simple material to work with that did not require sophisticated machinery. Rubik made the original prototypes of his cube by hand, cutting the wood, boring the holes and using elastic bands to hold the contraption together.<ref name=\"CNN\"/>\n\nRubik showed his prototype to his class and his students liked it very much. Rubik realized that, because of the cube's simple structure, it could be manufactured relatively easily and might have appeal to a larger audience. Rubik's father possessed several patents, so Rubik was familiar with the process and applied for a patent for his invention. Rubik then set out to find a manufacturer in Hungary, but had great difficulty due to the rigid planned economy of Hungary at the time. Eventually, Rubik was able to find a small company that worked with plastic and made chess pieces.<ref name=\"Rubik Interview\"/> The cube was originally known in Hungary as the 'Magic Cube'.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rubik's Cube|url=https://www.firstversions.com/2015/08/rubiks-cube.html|publisher=First Versions|date=|access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nRubik licensed the Magic Cube to [[Ideal Toys]], a US company in 1979.

By 1980 Rubik's Cube was marketed throughout the world, and over 100 million authorized units, with an estimated 50 million unauthorized imitations, were sold, mostly during its subsequent three years of popularity. Approximately 50 books were published describing how to solve the puzzle of Rubik's Cube. Following his cube's popularity, Rubik opened a studio to develop designs in 1984; among its products was another popular puzzle toy, Rubik's Magic.\n\n===Education===\nFrom 1958 to 1962, Rubik specialised in sculpture at the Secondary School of Fine and Applied Arts. From 1962 to 1967, Rubik attended the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics|Budapest University of Technology]] where he became a member of the Architecture Faculty. From 1967 to 1971, Rubik attended the Hungarian Academy of Applied Arts and was on the Faculty of Interior Architecture and Design.<ref name=\"Rubik Interview\"/>\n\nRubik considers university and the education it afforded him as the decisive event which shaped his life. Rubik has stated that \"Schools offered me the opportunity to acquire knowledge of subjects or rather crafts that need a lot of practice, persistence and diligence with the direction of a mentor.\"<ref name=\"Rubik Interview\"/>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early professorship and birth of Rubik's Cube===\nFrom 1971 to 1979, Rubik was a professor of architecture at the [[Hungarian University of Applied Arts|Budapest College of Applied Arts]] (''Iparm\u0171v\u00e9szeti F\u0151iskola''). It was during his time there that he built designs for a three-dimensional puzzle and completed the first working prototype of the [[Rubik's Cube]] in 1974, applying for a patent on the puzzle in 1975. In an interview with [[CNN]], Rubik stated that he was \"searching to find a good task for my students.\"<ref name=\"CNN\">[http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/10/tech/rubiks-cube-inventor The little cube that changed the world] Retrieved 2013-04-29.</ref>\n\n{{quote|Space always intrigued me, with its incredibly rich possibilities, space alteration by (architectural) objects, objects' transformation in space (sculpture, design), movement in space and in time, their correlation, their repercussion on mankind, the relation between man and space, the object and time. I think the CUBE arose from this interest, from this search for expression and for this always more increased acuteness of these thoughts...}}\n\n[[File:Rubik's cube v3.svg|thumb|Rubik's Cube]]\n\n===From classroom tool to Magic Cube to Rubik's Cube===\nStarting with blocks of wood and rubber bands, Rubik set out to create a structure which would allow the individual pieces to move without the whole structure falling apart. Rubik originally used wood for the block because of the convenience of a workshop at the university and because he viewed wood as a simple material to work with that did not require sophisticated machinery. Rubik made the original prototypes of his cube by hand, cutting the wood, boring the holes and using elastic bands to hold the contraption together.<ref name=\"CNN\"/>\n\nRubik showed his prototype to his class and his students liked it very much. Rubik realized that, because of the cube's simple structure, it could be manufactured relatively easily and might have appeal to a larger audience. Rubik's father possessed several patents, so Rubik was familiar with the process and applied for a patent for his invention. Rubik then set out to find a manufacturer in Hungary, but had great difficulty due to the rigid planned economy of Hungary at the time. Eventually, Rubik was able to find a small company that worked with plastic and made chess pieces.<ref name=\"Rubik Interview\"/> The cube was originally known in Hungary as the 'Magic Cube'.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rubik's Cube|url=https://www.firstversions.com/2015/08/rubiks-cube.html|publisher=First Versions|date=|access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nRubik licensed the Magic Cube to [[Ideal Toys]], a US company in 1979.
