The Gallardo offers two choices of transmissions, a conventional (H-pattern) six-speed [[manual transmission]], and a more advanced six-speed electro-hydraulically actuated single-clutch [[Semi-automatic transmission|automated manual]] [[Transmission (mechanics)| transmission]], similar to a Formula One style single-clutch sequential gearbox, which Lamborghini abbreviates to \"E-gear\". The \"E-gear\" allows the driver to change gears much faster than they could with a manual transmission. The driver shifts up and down via paddles behind the steering wheel, but can also change to an automatic mode via the gear selector located in place of the gear shift lever.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambocars.com/gal/gall.php |title=Gallardo 5.0 - the STORY on |website=Lambocars.com |date=5 September 2008 |accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref> The vehicle was designed by [[Luc Donckerwolke]] and was based on the 1995 [[Lamborghini Cal\u00e0|Cal\u00e0]] prototype designed by [[Italdesign Giugiaro]].\n\n===2005 Coup\u00e9 update===\nFor the 2006 model year (launched in late 2005) Lamborghini introduced many changes to the car to counter some criticisms garnered from the press and owners. These changes were realised in the form of the limited edition Gallardo SE. The exhaust system was changed to a more sporty one (including a flap to make it quieter during city driving), the suspension was revised, a new steering rack was fitted, the engine power was increased by 20&nbsp;PS to a maximum of {{convert|520|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, and the biggest change was overall low gearing ratios, especially in 1st to 5th gear.

The Concept S was intended to be a modern interpretation of the single-seat roadsters of the past.

The [[rear-view mirror]] is even electronically retractable to allow the driver to see behind, when necessary, or to retract it into the dashboard when not needed. Though considered more of a styling exercise than a working production vehicle, the final working show car only had to be modified slightly from the original computer-aided designs. Lamborghini was rumoured to be building 100 examples for customers, but decided to keep it as a styling exercise. Only 2 cars were produced: the high-window prototype sits in the Lamborghini museum with no engine, while the running low-window prototype featured at Pebble Beach was up for auction on 10 December 2015 at RM Sotheby's Manhattan event \"Driven by Disruption\". It was expected to sell for US$2.4 to 3 million, but failed to sell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carscoops.com/2015/12/lamborghini-concept-s-fails-to-sell-at.html|title=Lamborghini Concept S Fails To Sell At RM's New York Auction|last=Anderson|first=Brad|date=16 December 2015|publisher=Carscoops|accessdate=4 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529111845/http://www.carscoops.com/2015/12/lamborghini-concept-s-fails-to-sell-at.html|archivedate=29 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Gallardo Spyder===\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width =\n|image1= 06 Gallardo spyder.jpg\n|image2= 2006 Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder E-Gear - Flickr - The Car Spy (24) (cropped).jpg\n|image3= 2006 Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder E-Gear - Flickr - The Car Spy (18).jpg\n|footer= Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder\n}}\n\nThe convertible variant of the Gallardo, called the Gallardo Spyder, was unveiled at the [[Los Angeles Auto Show]] in January 2006.

The car used in 2006 was seen at the start of the 2006 [[Gumball 3000|Gumball Rally]].

It is distinguished from the regular Gallardo externally by a black-roofed two-tone color scheme as well as specially designed \"Callisto\" wheels. It also featured a two-tone interior further distinguishing it from the base model. All piping and stitching on the leather are executed in the same colour as the bodywork of the car. The midsections of the seats are finished in colour-coded upholstery and even the black floormats have a colour-coded border. A rear-view camera was standard on the Gallardo SE, as was the multimedia and navigation system, sports suspension and an exclusive cover. The optional E-gear transmission came with a new function: 'thrust' mode. This feature automatically revs the car to 5,000 rpm then drops the clutch engaging all four wheels in a controlled burnout to ensure that the car performs maximum acceleration.\n\n====Gallardo Nera (2007)====\n[[File:Lambo nera 07 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Lamborghini Gallardo Nera]]\nThe Gallardo Nera is a special edition (limited to 185 units) of the Gallardo and was introduced at the [[Mondial de l'Automobile 2006|Paris Motor Show]]. The car was designed to showcase the customization options available to the customer in the Ad Personam program. It features special matte black body panels and was only available in a special shade of black: a combination of Nero Serapis and Nero Noctis. Brake calipers are painted a special silver and the taillights are smoked to match the darker paint scheme. The interior is stitched from high-contrast black and white leather in the Q-Citura (lozenge shaped) fashion.\n\n===Motorsports===\n====FIA GT3 Championship====\nIn 2007, the Gallardo was entered in the [[FIA GT3 European Championship|FIA GT3 Championship]], built by German motorsport specialists [[Reiter Engineering]], who previously manufactured the [[Lamborghini Murci\u00e9lago|Murci\u00e9lago R-GT]] and the [[Lamborghini Diablo|Diablo GTR]] Super Trophy race cars. All the extra aerodynamic components were bolt-on parts, conforming with cost-effective regulations that meant the finished car had to closely resemble its road-going counterpart. [[Brembo]] racing brakes and [[OZ Group|OZ]] Racing wheels were also added. It was converted to rear wheel drive, other than when racing in the one-make Lamborghini Super Trofeo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supercars.net/cars/3475.html |title=SuperCars.net |publisher=SuperCars.net |date=1 March 2004 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}</ref> The engine generated a maximum power output of {{convert|520|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,800 rpm and {{convert|510|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,500 rpm.\n\n====Super GT====\nIn 2007, the Gallardo was entered by Japan Lamborghini Owners Club (JLOC) to the GT300 class of the Japanese Super GT Championship, the car had to conform to rather different regulations. The engine could only have a power output of {{convert|300|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and the car must be rear-wheel-drive. The power was limited by air restrictors placed in the engine bay. The gearbox is a sequential 6-Speed twin-clutch setup. The rules regarding aerodynamics are far looser than those in FIA GT, meaning the Super GT car has more advanced aero, including a much bigger rear wing. It took a while to be competitive, only being consistently at the top during the 2009 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supergt.net/en/ |title=SuperGT.net |publisher=SuperGT.net |accessdate=2 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605102641/http://www.supergt.net/en/ |archivedate=5 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Recall===\nLamborghini recalled about 1,500 Gallardo Coup\u00e9 and Spyder models, from model years 2004 to 2006, because of the possibility of [[power steering fluid]] leaking and the risk of fire.

The Gallardo offers two choices of transmissions, a conventional (H-pattern) six-speed [[manual transmission]], and a more advanced six-speed electro-hydraulically actuated single-clutch [[Semi-automatic transmission|automated manual]] [[Transmission| transmission]], similar to a Formula One style single-clutch sequential gearbox, which Lamborghini abbreviates to \"E-gear\". The \"E-gear\" allows the driver to change gears much faster than they could with a manual transmission. The driver shifts up and down via paddles behind the steering wheel, but can also change to an automatic mode via the gear selector located in place of the gear shift lever.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambocars.com/gal/gall.php |title=Gallardo 5.0 - the STORY on |website=Lambocars.com |date=5 September 2008 |accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref> The vehicle was designed by [[Luc Donckerwolke]] and was based on the 1995 [[Lamborghini Cal\u00e0|Cal\u00e0]] prototype designed by [[Italdesign Giugiaro]].\n\n===2005 Coup\u00e9 update===\nFor the 2006 model year (launched in late 2005) Lamborghini introduced many changes to the car to counter some criticisms garnered from the press and owners. These changes were realised in the form of the limited edition Gallardo SE. The exhaust system was changed to a more sporty one (including a flap to make it quieter during city driving), the suspension was revised, a new steering rack was fitted, the engine power was increased by 20&nbsp;PS to a maximum of {{convert|520|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, and the biggest change was overall low gearing ratios, especially in 1st to 5th gear. These changes gave the car much better performance than the original.\n\n==={{anchor|Concept S}}Lamborghini Concept S===\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width =\n|image1= Lamborghini Gallardo LP-560-4 Spyder (5482252151).jpg|\n|image2= Lamborghini Concept S rear - Flick - Concorso Italiano 2005.jpg\n|footer= Lamborghini Concept S\n}}\n\nThe '''Lamborghini Concept S''' is a [[concept car]] based on the Gallardo, featuring a speedster (Barchetta) body designed by [[Luc Donckerwolke]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.futurecar.co.za/category/20/luc-donckerwolke/ |title=Luc Donckerwolke \u00ab Future Car |publisher=Futurecar.co.za |date=25 June 2011 |accessdate=4 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514063421/http://www.futurecar.co.za/category/20/luc-donckerwolke/ |archivedate=14 May 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/motoring/news_reports/lamborghini-concept-s.htm |title=Lamborghini Concept S : News & Reports : Motoring |publisher=Web Wombat |date= |accessdate=4 July 2012}}</ref> It was built in 2005 and was first shown at that year's [[Geneva Motor Show#2005|Geneva Motor Show]]. The Concept S was intended to be a modern interpretation of the single-seat roadsters of the past. Utilising a 'saute-vent' ([[French language|French]] for 'change wind') instead of a traditional windscreen, and dividing the interior into two distinct compartments by continuing the bodywork between the seats, which also serves as an air inlet feeding the mid-mounted 5.0&nbsp;L V10 engine, giving the car a distinctly futuristic look along with increasing aerodynamic flow. The [[rear-view mirror]] is even electronically retractable to allow the driver to see behind, when necessary, or to retract it into the dashboard when not needed. Though considered more of a styling exercise than a working production vehicle, the final working show car only had to be modified slightly from the original computer-aided designs. Lamborghini was rumoured to be building 100 examples for customers, but decided to keep it as a styling exercise. Only 2 cars were produced: the high-window prototype sits in the Lamborghini museum with no engine, while the running low-window prototype featured at Pebble Beach was up for auction on 10 December 2015 at RM Sotheby's Manhattan event \"Driven by Disruption\". It was expected to sell for US$2.4 to 3 million, but failed to sell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carscoops.com/2015/12/lamborghini-concept-s-fails-to-sell-at.html|title=Lamborghini Concept S Fails To Sell At RM's New York Auction|last=Anderson|first=Brad|date=16 December 2015|publisher=Carscoops|accessdate=4 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529111845/http://www.carscoops.com/2015/12/lamborghini-concept-s-fails-to-sell-at.html|archivedate=29 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Gallardo Spyder===\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width =\n|image1= 06 Gallardo spyder.jpg\n|image2= 2006 Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder E-Gear - Flickr - The Car Spy (24) (cropped).jpg\n|image3= 2006 Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder E-Gear - Flickr - The Car Spy (18).jpg\n|footer= Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder\n}}\n\nThe convertible variant of the Gallardo, called the Gallardo Spyder, was unveiled at the [[Los Angeles Auto Show]] in January 2006.

When the [[Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n|Hurac\u00e1n]], Gallardo's successor, was introduced, Lamborghini S.p.A produced a personalised version for the Italian police force serving as the replacement of the destroyed cars.\n\n====London Metropolitan Police====\nTwo Gallardos have been \"temporary\" police cars for the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] in London, one in 2005 and one in 2006, for specific publicity events. The car used in 2006 was seen at the start of the 2006 [[Gumball 3000|Gumball Rally]]. Both vehicles were lent by Lamborghini London and were fitted with yellow and blue [[battenburg markings]], police logos and a small blue [[lightbar]].\n\n====Gallardo SE (2005)====\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width =\n|image1= Lamborghini Gallardo SE - Flickr - Alexandre Pr\u00e9vot (4) (cropped).jpg\n|image2= Lamborghini Gallardo SE - Flickr - Alexandre Pr\u00e9vot (5) (cropped).jpg\n|footer= Lamborghini Gallardo SE\n}}\n\nThe Gallardo SE is a limited edition of 250 units introduced in 2005. It is distinguished from the regular Gallardo externally by a black-roofed two-tone color scheme as well as specially designed \"Callisto\" wheels. It also featured a two-tone interior further distinguishing it from the base model. All piping and stitching on the leather are executed in the same colour as the bodywork of the car. The midsections of the seats are finished in colour-coded upholstery and even the black floormats have a colour-coded border. A rear-view camera was standard on the Gallardo SE, as was the multimedia and navigation system, sports suspension and an exclusive cover. The optional E-gear transmission came with a new function: 'thrust' mode. This feature automatically revs the car to 5,000 rpm then drops the clutch engaging all four wheels in a controlled burnout to ensure that the car performs maximum acceleration.\n\n====Gallardo Nera (2007)====\n[[File:Lambo nera 07 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Lamborghini Gallardo Nera]]\nThe Gallardo Nera is a special edition (limited to 185 units) of the Gallardo and was introduced at the [[Mondial de l'Automobile 2006|Paris Motor Show]]. The car was designed to showcase the customization options available to the customer in the Ad Personam program. It features special matte black body panels and was only available in a special shade of black: a combination of Nero Serapis and Nero Noctis. Brake calipers are painted a special silver and the taillights are smoked to match the darker paint scheme. The interior is stitched from high-contrast black and white leather in the Q-Citura (lozenge shaped) fashion.\n\n===Motorsports===\n====FIA GT3 Championship====\nIn 2007, the Gallardo was entered in the [[FIA GT3 European Championship|FIA GT3 Championship]], built by German motorsport specialists [[Reiter Engineering]], who previously manufactured the [[Lamborghini Murci\u00e9lago|Murci\u00e9lago R-GT]] and the [[Lamborghini Diablo|Diablo GTR]] Super Trophy race cars. All the extra aerodynamic components were bolt-on parts, conforming with cost-effective regulations that meant the finished car had to closely resemble its road-going counterpart. [[Brembo]] racing brakes and [[OZ Group|OZ]] Racing wheels were also added. It was converted to rear wheel drive, other than when racing in the one-make Lamborghini Super Trofeo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supercars.net/cars/3475.html |title=SuperCars.net |publisher=SuperCars.net |date=1 March 2004 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}</ref> The engine generated a maximum power output of {{convert|520|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,800 rpm and {{convert|510|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,500 rpm.\n\n====Super GT====\nIn 2007, the Gallardo was entered by Japan Lamborghini Owners Club (JLOC) to the GT300 class of the Japanese Super GT Championship, the car had to conform to rather different regulations. The engine could only have a power output of {{convert|300|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and the car must be rear-wheel-drive. The power was limited by air restrictors placed in the engine bay. The gearbox is a sequential 6-Speed twin-clutch setup. The rules regarding aerodynamics are far looser than those in FIA GT, meaning the Super GT car has more advanced aero, including a much bigger rear wing. It took a while to be competitive, only being consistently at the top during the 2009 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supergt.net/en/ |title=SuperGT.net |publisher=SuperGT.net |accessdate=2 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605102641/http://www.supergt.net/en/ |archivedate=5 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Recall===\nLamborghini recalled about 1,500 Gallardo Coup\u00e9 and Spyder models, from model years 2004 to 2006, because of the possibility of [[power steering fluid]] leaking and the risk of fire.

More recently, logic has been studied in [[cognitive science]], which draws on  [[computer science]], [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]], among other disciplines.\n\n==Concepts==\n{{rquote|right|Upon this first, and in one sense this sole, rule of reason, that in order to learn you must desire to learn, and in so desiring not be satisfied with what you already incline to capably think, there follows one corollary which itself deserves to be inscribed upon every wall of the city of philosophy: Do not block the way of inquiry.|[[Charles Sanders Peirce]], \"First Rule of Logic\"}}\n[[File:Argument terminology used in logic (en).svg|thumb|400px|right|[[Argument]] terminology used in logic]]\nThe concepts of [[logical form]] and [[argument]] are central to logic. An argument is constructed by applying one of the forms of the different types of logical reasoning: deductive, inductive, abductive. In deduction, the ''validity'' of an argument is determined solely by its logical form, not its content, while the ''soundness'' requires both validity and that all the given premises are actually true.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/val-snd/ |title=Validity and Soundness |website=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (IEP) |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180527093407/http://www.iep.utm.edu/val-snd/ |archive-date=27 May 2018}}</ref> Completeness, consistency, decidability, and expressivity, are further fundamental concepts in logic. The categorization of the [[Logical system|logical systems]] and of their properties has led to the emergence of a metatheory of logic known as [[metalogic]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Ewald |first=William |title=The Emergence of First-Order Logic |date=2019 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2019/entries/logic-firstorder-emergence/ |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |edition=Spring 2019 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref>  \n\n* '''[[Informal logic]]''' is the study of [[natural language]] [[argument]]s. The study of [[fallacies]] is an important branch of informal logic. Since much informal argument is not strictly speaking deductive, on some conceptions of logic, informal logic is not logic at all.  See {{slink||Rival conceptions}} below.\n* '''[[Formal logical systems|Formal logic]]''' is the study of [[inference]] with purely formal content. An inference possesses a ''purely formal content'' if it can be expressed as a particular application of a wholly abstract rule, that is, a rule that is not about any particular thing or property. Traditional [[Syllogism|syllogistic logic]], also known as term logic, and modern [[Symbolic Logic|symbolic logic]], the study of symbolic abstractions that capture the formal features of logical inference,<ref name=\"Principia\" /><ref name=\"Hamilton\" /> are examples of formal logic. Symbolic logic is often divided into two main branches: [[propositional logic]] and [[predicate logic]]. The works of [[Aristotle]] contain the earliest known formal study of the [[syllogism]]. Modern formal logic follows and expands on Aristotle.<ref name=\"The Basic Works\" /> In many definitions of logic, [[logical consequence|logical inference]] and inference with purely formal content are the same. This does not render the notion of informal logic vacuous, because no formal logic captures all of the nuances of natural language.\n* '''[[Mathematical logic]]''' is an extension of symbolic logic into other areas, in particular to the study of [[model theory]], [[proof theory]], [[set theory]], and [[computability theory]].\n\nHowever, agreement on what logic actually is has remained elusive, although the field of [[universal logic]] has studied the common structure of logics.\n\n===Logical form===\n{{main|Logical form}}\nLogic is generally considered '''formal''' when it analyzes and represents the ''form'' of any [[Validity (logic)|valid argument]] type. The form of an argument is displayed by representing its sentences in the formal grammar and symbolism of a logical language to make its content usable in formal inference. Simply put, to formalize simply means to translate English sentences into the language of logic.\n\nThis is called showing the ''logical form'' of the argument. It is necessary because indicative sentences of ordinary language show a considerable variety of form and complexity that makes their use in inference impractical. It requires, first, ignoring those grammatical features irrelevant to logic (such as gender and declension, if the argument is in Latin), replacing conjunctions irrelevant to logic (such as \"but\") with [[logical conjunction]]s like \"and\" and replacing ambiguous, or alternative logical expressions (\"any\", \"every\", etc.) with expressions of a standard type (such as \"all\", or the [[universal quantifier]] \u2200).\n\nSecond, certain parts of the sentence must be replaced with schematic letters. Thus, for example, the expression \"all Ps are Qs\" shows the logical form common to the sentences \"all men are mortals\", \"all cats are carnivores\", \"all Greeks are philosophers\", and so on.  The schema can further be condensed into the [[formula]] ''A(P,Q)'', where the letter ''A'' indicates the judgement 'all \u2013 are \u2013'.\n\nThe importance of form was recognised from ancient times. Aristotle uses variable letters to represent valid inferences in ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', leading [[Jan \u0141ukasiewicz]] to say that the introduction of variables was \"one of Aristotle's greatest inventions\".<ref name=\"Aristotle\" /> According to the followers of Aristotle (such as [[Ammonius Saccas|Ammonius]]), only the logical principles stated in schematic terms belong to logic, not those given in concrete terms. The concrete terms \"man\", \"mortal\", etc., are analogous to the substitution values of the schematic placeholders ''P'', ''Q'', ''R'', which were called the \"matter\" (Greek ''hyle'') of the inference.\n\nThere is a big difference between the kinds of formulas seen in traditional term logic and the [[predicate calculus]] that is the fundamental advance of modern logic.  The formula ''A(P,Q)'' (all Ps are Qs) of traditional logic corresponds to the more complex formula <math>\\forall x (P(x) \\rightarrow Q(x))</math> in predicate logic, involving the logical connectives for [[universal quantification]] and [[material conditional|implication]] rather than just the predicate letter ''A'' and using variable arguments <math>P(x)</math> where traditional logic uses just the term letter ''P''.  With the complexity comes power, and the advent of the predicate calculus inaugurated revolutionary growth of the subject.\n\n=== Semantics ===\n{{main|Semantics of logic}}\n\nThe validity of an argument depends upon the meaning or ''semantics'' of the sentences that make it up.\n\nAristotle's [[Organon]], especially ''[[De Interpretatione]]'', gives a cursory outline of semantics which the [[scholastic logic]]ians, particularly in the thirteenth and fourteenth century, developed into a complex and sophisticated theory, called [[Supposition theory]].  This showed how the truth of simple sentences, expressed schematically, depend on how the terms 'supposit' or ''stand for'' certain extra-linguistic items.  For example, in part II of his [[Sum of Logic|Summa Logicae]], [[William of Ockham]] presents a comprehensive account of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of simple sentences, in order to show which arguments are valid and which are not.  Thus \"every A is B' is true if and only if there is something for which 'A' stands, and there is nothing for which 'A' stands, for which 'B' does not also stand.\"<ref>''Summa Logicae'' Part II c.4 transl. as ''Ockam's Theory of Propositions'', A. Freddoso and H. Schuurman, St Augustine's Press 1998, p. 96</ref>\n\nEarly modern logic defined semantics purely as a relation between ideas.  [[Antoine Arnauld]] in the ''[[Port Royal-Logic]]'', says that 'after conceiving things by our ideas, we compare these ideas, and, finding that some belong together and some do not, we unite or separate them. This is called ''affirming'' or ''denying'', and in general ''judging''.<ref>Arnauld, ''Logic or the Art of Thinking'' Part 2 Chapter 3.</ref> Thus truth and falsity are no more than the agreement or disagreement of ideas.  This suggests obvious difficulties, leading [[John Locke|Locke]] to distinguish between 'real' truth, when our ideas have 'real existence' and 'imaginary' or 'verbal' truth, where ideas like harpies or centaurs exist only in the mind.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Locke |first=John |title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding |title-link=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding |year=1690 |at=IV, v. 1-8 |author-link=John Locke}}</ref> This view ([[psychologism]]) was taken to the extreme in the nineteenth century, and is generally held by modern logicians to signify a low point in the decline of logic before the twentieth century.\n\nModern semantics is in some ways closer to the medieval view, in rejecting such psychological truth-conditions.  However, the introduction of [[quantifier (logic)|quantification]], needed to solve the [[problem of multiple generality]], rendered impossible the kind of subject-predicate analysis that underlies medieval semantics.  The main modern approach is ''model-theoretic semantics'', based on [[Alfred Tarski]]'s [[semantic theory of truth]].  The approach assumes that the meaning of the various parts of the propositions are given by the possible ways we can give a recursively specified group of [[interpretation function]]s from them to some predefined [[domain of discourse]]: an interpretation of [[first-order predicate logic]] is given by a mapping from terms to a universe of [[individual]]s, and a mapping from propositions to the truth values \"true\" and \"false\".  Model-theoretic semantics is one of the fundamental concepts of [[model theory]].  Modern semantics also admits rival approaches, such as the [[proof-theoretic semantics]] that associates the meaning of propositions with the roles that they can play in inferences, an approach that ultimately derives from the work of [[Gerhard Gentzen]] on [[structural proof theory]] and is heavily influenced by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s later philosophy, especially his aphorism \"meaning is use\".\n\n===Inference===\n''Inference'' is not to be confused with ''implication''.  An implication is a sentence of the form 'If p then q', and can be true or false.  [[Stoic logic|The Stoic logician]] [[Philo the Dialectician|Philo of Megara]] was the first to define the truth conditions of such an implication: false only when the antecedent p is true and the consequent q is false, in all other cases true.  An inference, on the other hand, consists of two separately asserted propositions of the form 'p therefore q'.  An inference is not true or false, but valid or invalid.  However, there is a connection between implication and inference, as follows: if the implication 'if p then q' is ''true'', the inference 'p therefore q' is ''valid''.  This was given an apparently paradoxical formulation by Philo, who said that the implication 'if it is day, it is night' is true only at night, so the inference 'it is day, therefore it is night' is valid in the night, but not in the day.\n\nThe theory of inference (or 'consequences') was systematically developed in medieval times by logicians such as [[William of Ockham]] and [[Walter Burley]].  It is uniquely medieval, though it has its origins in Aristotle's [[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]] and [[Boethius]]' ''De Syllogismis hypotheticis''.  This is why many terms in logic are Latin.  For example, the rule that licenses the move from the implication 'if p then q' plus the assertion of its antecedent p, to the assertion of the consequent q is known as [[modus ponens]] (or 'mode of positing').  Its Latin formulation is 'Posito antecedente ponitur consequens'.  The Latin formulations of many other rules such as 'ex falso quodlibet' (anything follows from a falsehood), 'reductio ad absurdum' (disproof by showing the consequence is absurd) also date from this period.\n\nHowever, the theory of consequences, or of the so-called '[[hypothetical syllogism]]' was never fully integrated into the theory of the 'categorical syllogism'.  This was partly because of the resistance to reducing the categorical judgment 'Every S is P' to the so-called hypothetical judgment 'if anything is S, it is P'.  The first was thought to imply 'some S is P', the second was not, and as late as 1911 in the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] article on Logic, we find the Oxford logician T.H. Case arguing against Sigwart's and Brentano's modern analysis of the universal proposition.\n\n===Logical systems===\n{{main|Formal system}}\nA formal system is an organization of terms used for the analysis of deduction. It consists of an alphabet, a language over the alphabet to construct sentences, and a rule for deriving sentences. Among the important properties that [[logical system]]s can have are:\n* '''[[Consistency]]''', which means that no theorem of the system contradicts another.<ref name=\"Bergmann, Merrie 2009\" />\n* '''[[Validity (logic)|Validity]]''', which means that the system's rules of proof never allow a false inference from true premises.\n* '''[[completeness (logic)|Completeness]]''', which means that if a formula is true, it can be proven, i.e. is a ''theorem'' of the system.\n* '''[[Soundness]]''', meaning that if any formula is a theorem of the system, it is true. This is the converse of completeness. (Note that in a distinct philosophical use of the term, an argument is sound when it is both valid and its premises are true).<ref>''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://www.iep.utm.edu/val-snd/ Validity and Soundness]</ref>\n* '''[[Expressive power (computer science)|Expressivity]]''', meaning what concepts can be expressed in the system.\n\nSome logical systems do not have all four properties. As an example, [[Kurt G\u00f6del]]'s [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]] show that sufficiently complex formal systems of arithmetic cannot be consistent and complete;<ref name=\"Hamilton\" /> however, first-order predicate logics not extended by specific [[axiom]]s to be arithmetic formal systems with equality can be complete and consistent.<ref name=\"Introduction to Mathematical Logic\" />\n\n===Logic and rationality===\n{{main|Logic and rationality}}\n{{confusing|section|date=May 2016}}\nAs the study of argument is of clear importance to the reasons that we hold things to be true, logic is of essential importance to [[rationality]].  Here we have defined logic to be \"the systematic study of the form of arguments\"; the reasoning behind argument is of several sorts, but only some of these arguments fall under the aegis of logic proper.\n\n[[Deductive reasoning]] concerns the [[logical consequence]] of given premises and is the form of reasoning most closely connected to logic. On a narrow conception of logic (see below) logic concerns just deductive reasoning, although such a narrow conception controversially excludes most of what is called informal logic from the discipline.\n\nThere are other forms of reasoning that are rational but that are generally not taken to be part of logic.  These include [[inductive reasoning]], which covers forms of inference that move from collections of particular judgements to universal judgements, and [[abductive reasoning]],<ref name=\"abduction\">On [[abductive reasoning]], see:\n* Magnani, L.

The American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839\u20131914) first introduced the term as \"guessing\".<ref name=\"guess\">See [http://www.commens.org/dictionary/term/abduction Abduction] and [http://www.commens.org/dictionary/term/retroduction Retroduction] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115846/http://www.commens.org/dictionary/term/retroduction |date=26 August 2014 }} at ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms'', and see Peirce's papers:\n* \"On the Logic of drawing History from Ancient Documents especially from Testimonies\" (1901), ''Collected Papers'' v. 7, paragraph 219.\n* \"PAP\" [\"Prolegomena to an Apology for Pragmatism\"], MS 293 c. 1906, ''New Elements of Mathematics'' v. 4, pp. 319\u2013320.\n* A Letter to F.A. Woods (1913), ''Collected Papers'' v. 8, paragraphs 385\u2013388.</ref> Peirce said that to ''abduce'' a hypothetical explanation <math>a</math> from an observed surprising circumstance <math>b</math> is to surmise that <math>a</math> may be true because then <math>b</math> would be a matter of course.<ref name=\"HL\">Peirce, C.S. (1903), Harvard lectures on pragmatism, ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, [http://www.textlog.de/7664-2.html paragraphs 188\u2013189].</ref> Thus, to abduce <math>a</math> from <math>b</math> involves determining that <math>a</math> is [[necessary and sufficient conditions|sufficient (or nearly sufficient), but not necessary]], for <math>b</math>.\n\nWhile inductive and abductive inference are not part of logic proper, the methodology of logic has been applied to them with some degree of success.  For example, the notion of deductive validity (where an inference is deductively valid [[if and only if]] there is no possible situation in which all the premises are true but the conclusion false) exists in an analogy to the notion of inductive validity, or \"strength\", where an inference is inductively strong if and only if its premises give some degree of probability to its conclusion.  Whereas the notion of deductive validity can be rigorously stated for systems of formal logic in terms of the well-understood notions of [[semantics]], inductive validity requires us to define a reliable generalization of some set of observations. The task of providing this definition may be approached in various ways, some less formal than others; some of these definitions may use logical association [[rule induction]], while others may use [[mathematical model]]s of probability such as [[decision tree]]s.\n\n===Rival conceptions===\n{{Main|Conceptions of logic}}\nLogic arose (see below) from a concern with correctness of [[argumentation]]. Modern logicians usually wish to ensure that logic studies just those arguments that arise from appropriately general forms of inference. For example, Thomas Hofweber writes in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' that logic \"does not, however, cover good reasoning as a whole. That is the job of the theory of [[rationality]]. Rather it deals with inferences whose validity can be traced back to the formal features of the representations that are involved in that inference, be they linguistic, mental, or other representations.\"<ref name=\"stanford-logic-onthology\" />\n\nThe idea that logic treats special forms of argument, deductive argument, rather than argument in general, has a history in logic that dates back at least to [[logicism]] in mathematics (19th and 20th centuries) and the advent of the influence of mathematical logic on philosophy.  A consequence of taking logic to treat special kinds of argument is that it leads to identification of special kinds of truth, the logical truths (with logic equivalently being the study of logical truth), and excludes many of the original objects of study of logic that are treated as informal logic.  [[Robert Brandom]] has argued against the idea that logic is the study of a special kind of logical truth, arguing that instead one can talk of the logic of [[material inference]] (in the terminology of [[Wilfred Sellars]]), with logic making explicit the commitments that were originally implicit in informal inference.<ref name=\"brandom-2000\" />{{page needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of logic}}\n[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Aristotle]], 384\u2013322&nbsp;BCE.]]\nLogic comes from the Greek word ''logos'', originally meaning \"the word\" or \"what is spoken\", but coming to mean \"thought\" or \"reason\". In the Western World, logic was first developed by [[Aristotle]], who called the subject 'analytics'.<ref name=\"achievement\" /> [[Aristotelian logic]] became widely accepted in science and mathematics and remained in wide use in the West until the early 19th&nbsp;century.<ref name=\"mtu\" /> Aristotle's system of logic was responsible for the introduction of [[hypothetical syllogism]],<ref name=\"google\" /> [[Temporal logic|temporal]] [[modal logic]],<ref name=\"google1\" /><ref name=\"google2\" /> and [[Inductive reasoning|inductive logic]],<ref name=\"google3\" /> as well as influential vocabulary such as [[terminology|terms]], [[predicable]]s, [[syllogism]]s and [[proposition]]s. There was also the rival [[Stoic logic]].\n\nIn [[Europe]] during the later medieval period, major efforts were made to show that Aristotle's ideas were compatible with [[Christianity|Christian]] faith. During the [[High Middle Ages]], logic became a main focus of philosophers, who would engage in critical logical analyses of philosophical arguments, often using variations of the methodology of [[scholasticism]]. In 1323, [[William of Ockham]]'s influential ''[[Sum of Logic|Summa Logicae]]'' was released. By the 18th century, the structured approach to arguments had degenerated and fallen out of favour, as depicted in [[Ludvig Holberg|Holberg]]'s satirical play ''[[Erasmus Montanus]]''.\nThe [[Logic in China|Chinese logical]] philosopher [[Gongsun Long]] ({{nowrap|c. 325\u2013250 BCE}}) proposed the paradox \"One and one cannot become two, since neither becomes two.\"<ref name=\"propositions\" /> In China, the tradition of scholarly investigation into logic, however, was repressed by the [[Qin dynasty]] following the legalist philosophy of [[Han Feizi]].\n\nIn India, the [[Anviksiki]] school of logic was founded by [[Indian logic|Medhatithi Gautama]] (c. 6th century BCE).<ref>S.C. Vidyabhusana (1971). ''A History of Indian Logic: Ancient, Mediaeval, and Modern Schools'', pp. 17\u201321.</ref> Innovations in the scholastic school, called [[Nyaya]], continued from ancient times into the early 18th&nbsp;century with the [[Navya-Nyaya]] school. By the 16th&nbsp;century, it developed theories resembling modern logic, such as [[Gottlob Frege]]'s \"distinction between sense and reference of proper names\" and his \"definition of number\", as well as the theory of \"restrictive conditions for universals\" anticipating some of the developments in modern [[set theory]].<ref name=\"Chakrabarti\" /> Since 1824, Indian logic attracted the attention of many Western scholars, and has had an influence on important 19th-century logicians such as [[Charles Babbage]], [[Augustus De Morgan]], and [[George Boole]].<ref name=\"Indian logic: a reader\" /> In the 20th&nbsp;century, Western philosophers like Stanislaw Schayer and Klaus Glashoff have explored Indian logic more extensively.\n\nThe [[Syllogism|syllogistic]] logic developed by Aristotle predominated in the West until the mid-19th&nbsp;century, when interest in the [[foundations of mathematics]] stimulated the development of symbolic logic (now called [[mathematical logic]]). In 1854, George Boole published ''[[The Laws of Thought|An Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities]]'', introducing symbolic logic and the principles of what is now known as [[Boolean logic]]. In 1879, Gottlob Frege published ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'', which inaugurated modern logic with the invention of [[Quantification (logic)|quantifier]] notation, reconciling the Aristotelian and Stoic logics in a broader system, and solving such problems for which Aristotelian logic was impotent, such as the [[problem of multiple generality]]. From 1910 to 1913, [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] published ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''<ref name=\"Principia\" /> on the foundations of mathematics, attempting to derive mathematical truths from [[axiom]]s and [[inference rule]]s in symbolic logic. In 1931, [[G\u00f6del]] raised serious problems with the foundationalist program and logic ceased to focus on such issues.\n\nThe development of logic since Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein had a profound influence on the practice of philosophy and the perceived nature of philosophical problems (see [[analytic philosophy]]) and [[philosophy of mathematics]]. Logic, especially sentential logic, is implemented in computer [[Digital electronics|logic circuits]] and is fundamental to [[computer science]]. Logic is commonly taught by university philosophy, sociology, advertising and literature departments, often as a compulsory discipline.\n\n=={{vanchor|Types}}==\n===Syllogistic logic===\n{{main|Aristotelian logic}}\n[[File:Johannesmagistris-square.jpg|thumb|A depiction from the 15th century of the [[square of opposition]], which expresses the fundamental dualities of syllogistic.]]\n\nThe ''[[Organon]]'' was [[Aristotle]]'s body of work on logic, with the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'' constituting the first explicit work in formal logic, introducing the syllogistic.<ref name=\"Aristotle\" /> The parts of syllogistic logic, also known by the name [[term logic]], are the analysis of the judgements into propositions consisting of two terms that are related by one of a fixed number of relations, and the expression of inferences by means of [[syllogism]]s that consist of two propositions sharing a common term as premise, and a conclusion that is a proposition involving the two unrelated terms from the premises.\n\nAristotle's work was regarded in classical times and from medieval times in Europe and the Middle East as the very picture of a fully worked out system. However, it was not alone: the [[Stoics]] proposed a system of [[propositional logic]] that was studied by medieval logicians. Also, the [[problem of multiple generality]] was recognized in medieval times. Nonetheless, problems with syllogistic logic were not seen as being in need of revolutionary solutions.\n\nToday, some academics claim that Aristotle's system is generally seen as having little more than historical value (though there is some current interest in extending term logics), regarded as made obsolete by the advent of propositional logic and the [[predicate calculus]]. Others use Aristotle in [[argumentation theory]] to help develop and critically question argumentation schemes that are used in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[legal]] arguments.\n\n===Propositional logic===\n{{main|Propositional calculus}}\nA propositional calculus or logic (also a sentential calculus) is a formal system in which formulae representing propositions can be formed by combining [[atomic propositions]] using [[logical connectives]], and in which a system of formal proof rules establishes certain formulae as \"theorems\".  An example of a theorem of propositional logic is <math>A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow A</math>, which says that if A holds, then B implies A.\n\n===Predicate logic===\n[[File:BS-12-Begriffsschrift Quantifier1-svg.svg|thumb|[[Gottlob Frege]]'s ''[[Begriffschrift]]'' introduced the notion of quantifier in a graphical notation, which here represents the judgement that <math>\\forall x. F(x)</math> is true.]]\n{{main|Predicate logic}}\nPredicate logic is the generic term for symbolic formal systems such as [[first-order logic]], [[second-order logic]], [[many-sorted logic]], and [[infinitary logic]].  It provides an account of [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]] general enough to express a wide set of arguments occurring in natural language.   For example, [[Bertrand Russell]]'s famous [[barber paradox]], \"there is a man who shaves all and only men who do not shave themselves\" can be formalised by the sentence <math>(\\exists x ) (\\text{man}(x) \\wedge (\\forall y) (\\text{man}(y) \\rightarrow (\\text{shaves}(x, y)  \\leftrightarrow \\neg \\text{shaves}(y, y))))</math>, using the non-logical predicate <math>\\text{man}(x)</math> to indicate that ''x'' is a man, and the non-logical relation <math>\\text{shaves}(x, y)</math> to indicate that ''x'' shaves ''y''; all other symbols of the formulae are logical, expressing the universal and existential [[quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]], [[logical conjunction|conjunction]], [[Material conditional|implication]], [[negation]] and [[biconditional]].\n\nWhilst Aristotelian syllogistic logic specifies a small number of forms that the relevant part of the involved judgements may take, predicate logic allows sentences to be analysed into subject and argument in several additional ways\u2014allowing predicate logic to solve the [[problem of multiple generality]] that had perplexed medieval logicians.\n\nThe development of predicate logic is usually attributed to [[Gottlob Frege]], who is also credited as one of the founders of [[analytic philosophy]], but the formulation of predicate logic most often used today is the first-order logic presented in [[Principles of Mathematical Logic]] by [[David Hilbert]] and [[Wilhelm Ackermann]] in 1928. The analytical generality of predicate logic allowed the formalization of mathematics, drove the investigation of [[set theory]], and allowed the development of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s approach to [[model theory]]. It provides the foundation of modern [[mathematical logic]].\n\nFrege's original system of predicate logic was second-order, rather than first-order. [[Second-order logic]] is most prominently defended (against the criticism of [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] and others) by [[George Boolos]] and [[Stewart Shapiro]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Modal logic===\n{{main|Modal logic}}\nIn languages, [[Linguistic modality|modality]] deals with the phenomenon that sub-parts of a sentence may have their semantics modified by special verbs or modal particles. For example, \"''We go to the games''\" can be modified to give \"''We should go to the games''\", and \"''We can go to the games''\" and perhaps \"''We will go to the games''\". More abstractly, we might say that modality affects the circumstances in which we take an assertion to be satisfied. Confusing modality is known as the [[modal fallacy]].\n\n[[Aristotle]]'s logic is in large parts concerned with the theory of non-modalized logic. Although, there are passages in his work, such as the famous [[problem of future contingents|sea-battle argument]] in ''[[De Interpretatione]]'' \u00a7 9, that are now seen as anticipations of modal logic and its connection with [[potentiality]] and time, the earliest formal system of modal logic was developed by [[Avicenna]], who ultimately developed a theory of \"[[Temporal logic|temporally]] [[Modal logic|modalized]]\" syllogistic.<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 |title=History of logic: Arabic logic |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]}}</ref>\n\nWhile the study of necessity and possibility remained important to philosophers, little logical innovation happened until the landmark investigations of [[C. I. Lewis]] in 1918, who formulated a family of rival axiomatizations of the [[Alethic modality|alethic modalities]]. His work unleashed a torrent of new work on the topic, expanding the kinds of modality treated to include [[deontic logic]] and [[epistemic logic]].  The seminal work of [[Arthur Prior]] applied the same formal language to treat [[temporal logic]] and paved the way for the marriage of the two subjects. [[Saul Kripke]] discovered (contemporaneously with rivals) his theory of [[Kripke semantics|frame semantics]], which revolutionized the formal technology available to modal logicians and gave a new [[graph theory|graph-theoretic]] way of looking at modality that has driven many applications in [[computational linguistics]] and [[computer science]], such as [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]].\n\n===Informal reasoning and dialectic===\n{{main|Informal logic|Logic and dialectic}}\nThe motivation for the study of logic in ancient times was clear: it is so that one may learn to distinguish good arguments from bad arguments, and so become more effective in argument and oratory, and perhaps also to become a better person. Half of the works of Aristotle's [[Organon]] treat inference as it occurs in an informal setting, side by side with the development of the syllogistic, and in the Aristotelian school, these informal works on logic were seen as complementary to Aristotle's treatment of [[rhetoric]].\n\nThis ancient motivation is still alive, although it no longer takes centre stage in the picture of logic; typically [[dialectic]]al logic forms the heart of a course in [[critical thinking]], a compulsory course at many universities.  Dialectic has been linked to logic since ancient times, but it has not been until recent decades that European and American logicians have attempted to provide mathematical foundations for logic and dialectic by formalising dialectical logic. [[Dialectical logic]] is also the name given to the special treatment of dialectic in [[Hegel]]ian and [[Marx]]ist thought.  There have been pre-formal treatises on argument and dialectic, from authors such as [[Stephen Toulmin]] (''The Uses of Argument''), [[Nicholas Rescher]] (''Dialectics''),<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Rescher |first=Nicholas |date=1978 |title=Dialectics: A Controversy-Oriented Approach to the Theory of Knowledge |url=http://ojs.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/article/view/2809 |journal=Informal Logic |volume=1 |issue=#3}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hetherington |first=Stephen |date=2006 |title=Nicholas Rescher: Philosophical Dialectics |url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/25075-philosophical-dialectics-an-essay-on-metaphilosophy/ |journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews |issue=2006.07.16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Rescher |first=Nicholas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T65moyMMioYC |title=Reason, Method, and Value: A Reader on the Philosophy of Nicholas Rescher |date=2009 |publisher=Ontos Verlag |isbn=978-3-11-032905-6 |editor-last=Jacquette, Dale}}</ref> and van Eemeren and Grootendorst ([[Pragma-dialectics]]).  Theories of [[defeasible reasoning]] can provide a foundation for the formalisation of dialectical logic and dialectic itself can be formalised as moves in a game, where an advocate for the truth of a proposition and an opponent argue.  Such games can provide a formal [[game semantics]] for many logics.\n\n[[Argumentation theory]] is the study and research of informal logic, fallacies, and critical questions as they relate to every day and practical situations. Specific types of dialogue can be analyzed and questioned to reveal premises, conclusions, and fallacies. Argumentation theory is now applied in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[law]].\n\n===Mathematical logic===\n{{main|Mathematical logic}}\nMathematical logic comprises two distinct areas of research: the first is the application of the techniques of formal logic to mathematics and mathematical reasoning, and the second, in the other direction, the application of mathematical techniques to the representation and analysis of formal logic.<ref name=\"Introduction to Elementary Mathematical Logic\" />\n\nThe earliest use of mathematics and [[geometry]] in relation to logic and philosophy goes back to the ancient Greeks such as [[Euclid]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]].<ref name=\"The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle\" /> Many other ancient and medieval philosophers applied mathematical ideas and methods to their philosophical claims.<ref name=\"Prior Analytics\" />\n\nOne of the boldest attempts to apply logic to mathematics was the [[logicism]] pioneered by philosopher-logicians such as [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]. Mathematical theories were supposed to be logical [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], and the programme was to show this by means of a reduction of mathematics to logic.<ref name=\"Principia\" /> The various attempts to carry this out met with failure, from the crippling of Frege's project in his ''Grundgesetze'' by [[Russell's paradox]], to the defeat of [[Hilbert's program]] by [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem]]s.\n\nBoth the statement of Hilbert's program and its refutation by G\u00f6del depended upon their work establishing the second area of mathematical logic, the application of mathematics to logic in the form of [[proof theory]].<ref name=\"Introduction to Mathematical Logic5\" /> Despite the negative nature of the incompleteness theorems, [[G\u00f6del's completeness theorem]], a result in [[model theory]] and another application of mathematics to logic, can be understood as showing how close logicism came to being true: every rigorously defined mathematical theory can be exactly captured by a first-order logical theory; Frege's [[proof calculus]] is enough to ''describe'' the whole of mathematics, though not ''equivalent'' to it.\n\nIf proof theory and model theory have been the foundation of mathematical logic, they have been but two of the four pillars of the subject.<ref>Barwise (1982) divides the subject of mathematical logic into model theory, proof theory, set theory and recursion theory.</ref> [[Set theory]] originated in the study of the infinite by [[Georg Cantor]], and it has been the source of many of the most challenging and important issues in mathematical logic, from [[Cantor's theorem]], through the status of the [[Axiom of Choice]] and the question of the independence of the [[continuum hypothesis]], to the modern debate on [[large cardinal]] axioms.\n\n[[Recursion theory]] captures the idea of computation in logical and [[arithmetic]] terms; its most classical achievements are the undecidability of the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] by [[Alan Turing]], and his presentation of the [[Church\u2013Turing thesis]].<ref name=\"Theory of computation: formal languages, automata, and complexity\" /> Today recursion theory is mostly concerned with the more refined problem of [[complexity class]]es\u2014when is a problem efficiently solvable?\u2014and the classification of [[Turing degree|degrees of unsolvability]].<ref name=\"Theory of computation: formal languages, automata, and complexity6\" />\n\n===Philosophical logic===\n{{main|Philosophical logic}}\n[[Philosophical logic]] deals with formal descriptions of ordinary, non-specialist [[Natural language|(\"natural\") language]], that is strictly only about the arguments within philosophy's other branches. Most philosophers assume that the bulk of everyday<!--was: \"normal\" proper--> reasoning can be captured in logic if a method or methods to translate ordinary language into that logic can be found. Philosophical logic is essentially a continuation of the traditional discipline called \"logic\" before the invention of mathematical logic. Philosophical logic has a much greater concern with the connection between natural language and logic. As a result, philosophical logicians have contributed a great deal to the development of non-standard logics (e.g. [[free logic]]s, [[tense logic]]s) as well as various extensions of [[classical logic]] (e.g. [[modal logic]]s) and non-standard semantics for such logics (e.g. [[Saul Kripke|Kripke]]'s [[supervaluationism]] in the semantics of logic).\n\nLogic and the philosophy of language are closely related. Philosophy of language has to do with the study of how our language engages and interacts with our thinking. Logic has an immediate impact on other areas of study. Studying logic and the relationship between logic and ordinary speech can help a person better structure his own arguments and critique the arguments of others. Many popular arguments are filled with errors because so many people are untrained in logic and unaware of how to formulate an argument correctly.<ref>{{Citation |last=Goldman |first=Alvin I. |title=Epistemology and Cognition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9XwhBw2jMqMC&pg=PA293 |page=293 |year=1986 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-25896-9 |quote=untrained subjects are prone to commit various sorts of fallacies and mistakes}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |title=Intelligence, Mind, and Reasoning: Structure and Development |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HkukZOU2pzIC&pg=PA194 |volume=106 |page=194 |year=1994 |editor-last=Demetriou |editor-first=A. |series=Advances in Psychology |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-08-086760-1 |editor2-last=Efklides |editor2-first=A.}}</ref>\n\n===Computational logic===\n{{main|Computational logic|Logic in computer science}}\n[[File:Register transfer level - example toggler.svg|right|thumb|300px\n|A simple toggling circuit is expressed using a logic gate and a synchronous register.]]\nLogic cut to the heart of computer science as it emerged as a discipline: [[Alan Turing]]'s work on the ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' followed from [[Kurt G\u00f6del]]'s work on the [[incompleteness theorems]]. The notion of the general purpose computer that came from this work was of fundamental importance to the designers of the computer machinery in the 1940s.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, researchers predicted that when human knowledge could be expressed using logic with [[mathematical notation]], it would be possible to create a machine that mimics the problem-solving skills of a human being. This was more difficult than expected because of the complexity of human reasoning. In the summer of 1956, [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]], [[Marvin Minsky]], [[Claude Shannon]] and [[Nathaniel Rochester (computer scientist)|Nathan Rochester]] organized a conference on the subject of what they called \"[[artificial intelligence]]\" (a term coined by McCarthy for the occasion). Newell and Simon proudly presented the group with the [[Logic Theorist]] and were somewhat surprised when the program received a lukewarm reception.\n\nIn [[logic programming]], a program consists of a set of axioms and rules. Logic programming systems such as [[Prolog]] compute the consequences of the axioms and rules in order to answer a query.\n\nToday, logic is extensively applied in the field of artificial intelligence, and this field provide a rich source of problems in formal and informal logic. [[Argumentation theory]] is one good example of how logic is being applied to artificial intelligence. The [[ACM Computing Classification System]] in particular regards:\n* Section F.3 on \"Logics and meanings of programs\" and F.4 on \"Mathematical logic and formal languages\" as part of the theory of computer science: this work covers [[formal semantics of programming languages]], as well as work of [[formal methods]] such as [[Hoare logic]];\n* [[Boolean logic]] as fundamental to computer hardware: particularly, the system's section B.2 on \"[[Arithmetic and logic structures]]\", relating to operatives [[logical conjunction|AND]], [[negation|NOT]], and [[logical disjunction|OR]];\n* Many fundamental logical formalisms are essential to section I.2 on artificial intelligence, for example [[modal logic]] and [[default logic]] in [[Knowledge representation formalisms and methods]], [[Horn clause]]s in logic programming, and [[description logic]].\n\nFurthermore, computers can be used as tools for logicians. For example, in symbolic logic and mathematical logic, proofs by humans can be computer-assisted. Using [[automated theorem proving]], the machines can find and check proofs, as well as work with proofs too lengthy to write out by hand.\n\n===Non-classical logic===\n{{Main|Non-classical logic}}\nThe logics discussed above are all \"[[Principle of bivalence|bivalent]]\" or \"two-valued\"; that is, they are most naturally understood as dividing propositions into true and false propositions. [[Non-classical logic]]s are those systems that reject various rules of [[Classical logic]].\n\nHegel developed his own [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectic logic]] that extended [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s transcendental logic but also brought it back to ground by assuring us that \"neither in heaven nor in earth, neither in the world of mind nor of nature, is there anywhere such an abstract 'either\u2013or' as the understanding maintains. Whatever exists is concrete, with difference and opposition in itself\".<ref name=\"philosophical\" />\n\nIn 1910, [[Nicolai A. Vasiliev]] extended the law of excluded middle and the law of contradiction and proposed the law of excluded fourth and logic tolerant to contradiction.<ref name=\"Brenner2008\" /> In the early 20th&nbsp;century [[Jan \u0141ukasiewicz]] investigated the extension of the traditional true/false values to include a third value, \"possible\" (or an indeterminate, a hypothesis) so inventing [[ternary logic]], the first [[multi-valued logic]] in the Western tradition.<ref>{{Citation |last=Zegarelli |first=Mark |title=Logic For Dummies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xm0-0Rs2GVoC&pg=PA30 |page=30 |year=2010 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-1-118-05307-2}}</ref> \nA minor modification of the ternary logic was later introduced in a sibling ternary logic model proposed by [[Stephen Cole Kleene]]. Kleene's system differs from the \u0141ukasiewicz's logic with respect to an outcome of the implication. The former assumes that the operator of [[material conditional|implication]] between two hypotheses produces a hypothesis.\n\nLogics such as [[fuzzy logic]] have since been devised with an infinite number of \"degrees of truth\", represented by a [[real number]] between 0 and 1.<ref name=\"stanford\" />\n\n[[Intuitionistic logic]] was proposed by [[L.E.J. Brouwer]] as the correct logic for reasoning about mathematics, based upon his rejection of the [[law of the excluded middle]] as part of his [[intuitionism]]. Brouwer rejected formalization in mathematics, but his student [[Arend Heyting]] studied intuitionistic logic formally, as did [[Gerhard Gentzen]]. Intuitionistic logic is of great interest to computer scientists, as it is a [[constructive logic]] and sees many applications, such as extracting verified programs from proofs and influencing the design of [[programming language]]s through the [[formulae-as-types correspondence]].\n\n[[Modal logic]] is not truth conditional, and so it has often been proposed as a non-classical logic. However, modal logic is normally formalized with the principle of the excluded middle, and its [[relational semantics]] is bivalent, so this inclusion is disputable.\n\n==Controversies==\n===\"Is Logic Empirical?\"===\n{{details|Is Logic Empirical?}}\nWhat is the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] status of the [[Classical logic|laws of logic]]? What sort of argument is appropriate for criticizing purported principles of logic? In an influential paper entitled \"[[Is Logic Empirical?]]\"<ref name=\"Is Logic Empirical?\" /> [[Hilary Putnam]], building on a suggestion of [[W. V. Quine]], argued that in general the facts of propositional logic have a similar epistemological status as facts about the physical universe, for example as the laws of [[mechanics]] or of [[general relativity]], and in particular that what physicists have learned about quantum mechanics provides a compelling case for abandoning certain familiar principles of classical logic: if we want to be [[philosophical realism|realists]] about the physical phenomena described by quantum theory, then we should abandon the [[principle of distributivity]], substituting for classical logic the [[quantum logic]] proposed by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[John von Neumann]].<ref name=\"The Logic of Quantum Mechanics\" />\n\nAnother paper of the same name by [[Michael Dummett]] argues that Putnam's desire for realism mandates the law of distributivity.<ref name=\"Truth and Other Enigmas\" /> Distributivity of logic is essential for the realist's understanding of how propositions are true of the world in just the same way as he has argued the principle of bivalence is. In this way, the question, \"Is Logic Empirical?\" can be seen to lead naturally into the fundamental controversy in [[metaphysics]] on [[realism versus anti-realism]].\n\n===Implication: Strict or material===\n{{main|Paradoxes of material implication}}\nThe notion of implication formalized in classical logic does not comfortably translate into natural language by means of \"if&nbsp;... then&nbsp;...\", due to a number of problems called the [[paradoxes of material implication]].\n\nThe first class of paradoxes involves counterfactuals, such as ''If the moon is made of green cheese, then 2+2=5'', which are puzzling because natural language does not support the [[principle of explosion]]. Eliminating this class of paradoxes was the reason for [[C. I. Lewis]]'s formulation of [[strict implication]], which eventually led to more radically revisionist logics such as [[relevance logic]].\n\nThe second class of paradoxes involves redundant premises, falsely suggesting that we know the succedent because of the antecedent: thus \"if that man gets elected, granny will die\" is materially true since granny is mortal, regardless of the man's election prospects. Such sentences violate the [[Gricean maxim]] of relevance, and can be modelled by logics that reject the principle of [[monotonicity of entailment]], such as relevance logic.\n\n===Tolerating the impossible===\n{{main|Paraconsistent logic}}\n[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] was deeply critical of any simplified notion of the [[law of non-contradiction]]. It was based on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]'s idea that this law of logic also requires a sufficient ground to specify from what point of view (or time) one says that something cannot contradict itself. A building, for example, both moves and does not move; the ground for the first is our solar system and for the second the earth. In Hegelian dialectic, the law of non-contradiction, of identity, itself relies upon difference and so is not independently assertable.\n\nClosely related to questions arising from the paradoxes of implication comes the suggestion that logic ought to tolerate [[inconsistency]]. [[Relevance logic]] and [[paraconsistent logic]] are the most important approaches here, though the concerns are different: a key consequence of [[classical logic]] and some of its rivals, such as [[intuitionistic logic]], is that they respect the [[principle of explosion]], which means that the logic collapses if it is capable of deriving a contradiction. [[Graham Priest]], the main proponent of [[dialetheism]], has argued for paraconsistency on the grounds that there are in fact, true contradictions.<ref name=\"stanford7\" />{{clarify|this is a provocative statement that deserves an inline example or Wikipedia explanation of some sort|date=October 2016}}\n\n===Rejection of logical truth===\nThe philosophical vein of various kinds of skepticism contains many kinds of doubt and rejection of the various bases on which logic rests, such as the idea of logical form, correct inference, or meaning, typically leading to the conclusion that there are no [[logical truth]]s. This is in contrast with the usual views in [[philosophical skepticism]], where logic directs skeptical enquiry to doubt received wisdoms, as in the work of [[Sextus Empiricus]].\n\n[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] provides a strong example of the rejection of the usual basis of logic: his radical rejection of idealization led him to reject truth as a \"...&nbsp;mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms\u2014in short&nbsp;... metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins.\"<ref name=\"nietzsche\" /> His rejection of truth did not lead him to reject the idea of either inference or logic completely, but rather suggested that \"logic [came] into existence in man's head [out] of illogic, whose realm originally must have been immense. Innumerable beings who made inferences in a way different from ours perished\".<ref name=\"nietzsche8\" /> Thus there is the idea that logical inference has a use as a tool for human survival, but that its existence does not support the existence of truth, nor does it have a reality beyond the instrumental: \"Logic, too, also rests on assumptions that do not correspond to anything in the real world\".<ref name=\"nietzsche9\" />\n\nThis position held by Nietzsche however, has come under extreme scrutiny for several reasons. Some philosophers, such as [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]], claim his position is self-refuting\u2014and accuse Nietzsche of not even having a coherent perspective, let alone a theory of knowledge.<ref name=\"nietzsche10\" /> [[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs|Georg Luk\u00e1cs]], in his book ''The Destruction of Reason'', asserts that, \"Were we to study Nietzsche's statements in this area from a logico-philosophical angle, we would be confronted by a dizzy chaos of the most lurid assertions, arbitrary and violently incompatible.\"<ref name=\"marxists\" /> [[Bertrand Russell]] described Nietzsche's irrational claims with \"He is fond of expressing himself paradoxically and with a view to shocking conventional readers\" in his book ''A History of Western Philosophy''.<ref>{{Citation |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=A History of Western Philosophy And Its Connection with Political and Social Circumstances from the Earliest Times to the Present Day |url=http://www.ntslibrary.com/PDF%20Books/History%20of%20Western%20Philosophy.pdf/ |page=762 |df=dmy-all |year=1945 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528221822/http://www.ntslibrary.com/PDF%20Books/History%20of%20Western%20Philosophy.pdf |publisher=Simon and Schuster |archive-date=28 May 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n{{Wikipedia books}}\n\n{{Columns-list|\n* {{annotated link|Argument}}\n* {{annotated link|Argumentation theory}}\n* {{annotated link|Critical thinking}}\n* {{annotated link|Digital electronics}} (also known as ''[[digital logic]]'' or [[logic gate]]s)\n* {{annotated link|Fallacies}}\n* {{annotated link|List of logicians}}\n* {{annotated link|List of logic journals}}\n* {{annotated link|List of logic symbols}}\n* {{annotated link|Logic puzzle}}\n* {{annotated link|Mathematics}}\n** {{annotated link|List of mathematics articles}}\n** {{annotated link|Outline of mathematics}}\n* {{annotated link|Metalogic}}\n* {{annotated link|Outline of logic}}\n* {{annotated link|Philosophy}}\n** {{annotated link|List of philosophy topics}}\n** {{annotated link|Outline of philosophy}}\n* {{annotated link|Logos}}\n* {{annotated link|Logical reasoning}}\n* {{annotated link|Reason}}\n* {{annotated link|Truth}}\n* {{annotated link|Vector logic}}\n}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"achievement\">E.g., Kline (1972, p. 53) wrote \"A major achievement of Aristotle was the founding of the science of logic\".</ref>\n<!--\n<ref name=\"Advances in Argumentation Theory and Research\">{{Cite book |title=Advances in Argumentation Theory and Research |publisher=[[Southern Illinois University Press]] |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-8093-1050-0 |editor-last=Cox |editor-first=J.

The study of [[fallacies]] is an important branch of informal logic. Since much informal argument is not strictly speaking deductive, on some conceptions of logic, informal logic is not logic at all.  See {{slink||Rival conceptions}} below.\n* '''[[Formal logical systems|Formal logic]]''' is the study of [[inference]] with purely formal content. An inference possesses a ''purely formal content'' if it can be expressed as a particular application of a wholly abstract rule, that is, a rule that is not about any particular thing or property. Traditional [[Syllogism|syllogistic logic]], also known as term logic, and modern [[Symbolic Logic|symbolic logic]], the study of symbolic abstractions that capture the formal features of logical inference,<ref name=\"Principia\" /><ref name=\"Hamilton\" /> are examples of formal logic. Symbolic logic is often divided into two main branches: [[propositional logic]] and [[predicate logic]]. The works of [[Aristotle]] contain the earliest known formal study of the [[syllogism]]. Modern formal logic follows and expands on Aristotle.<ref name=\"The Basic Works\" /> In many definitions of logic, [[logical consequence|logical inference]] and inference with purely formal content are the same. This does not render the notion of informal logic vacuous, because no formal logic captures all of the nuances of natural language.\n* '''[[Mathematical logic]]''' is an extension of symbolic logic into other areas, in particular to the study of [[model theory]], [[proof theory]], [[set theory]], and [[computability theory]].\n\nHowever, agreement on what logic actually is has remained elusive, although the field of [[universal logic]] has studied the common structure of logics.\n\n===Logical form===\n{{main|Logical form}}\nLogic is generally considered '''formal''' when it analyzes and represents the ''form'' of any [[Validity (logic)|valid argument]] type. The form of an argument is displayed by representing its sentences in the formal grammar and symbolism of a logical language to make its content usable in formal inference. Simply put, to formalize simply means to translate English sentences into the language of logic.\n\nThis is called showing the ''logical form'' of the argument. It is necessary because indicative sentences of ordinary language show a considerable variety of form and complexity that makes their use in inference impractical. It requires, first, ignoring those grammatical features irrelevant to logic (such as gender and declension, if the argument is in Latin), replacing conjunctions irrelevant to logic (such as \"but\") with [[logical conjunction]]s like \"and\" and replacing ambiguous, or alternative logical expressions (\"any\", \"every\", etc.) with expressions of a standard type (such as \"all\", or the [[universal quantifier]] \u2200).\n\nSecond, certain parts of the sentence must be replaced with schematic letters. Thus, for example, the expression \"all Ps are Qs\" shows the logical form common to the sentences \"all men are mortals\", \"all cats are carnivores\", \"all Greeks are philosophers\", and so on.  The schema can further be condensed into the [[formula]] ''A(P,Q)'', where the letter ''A'' indicates the judgement 'all \u2013 are \u2013'.\n\nThe importance of form was recognised from ancient times. Aristotle uses variable letters to represent valid inferences in ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', leading [[Jan \u0141ukasiewicz]] to say that the introduction of variables was \"one of Aristotle's greatest inventions\".<ref name=\"Aristotle\" /> According to the followers of Aristotle (such as [[Ammonius Saccas|Ammonius]]), only the logical principles stated in schematic terms belong to logic, not those given in concrete terms. The concrete terms \"man\", \"mortal\", etc., are analogous to the substitution values of the schematic placeholders ''P'', ''Q'', ''R'', which were called the \"matter\" (Greek ''hyle'') of the inference.\n\nThere is a big difference between the kinds of formulas seen in traditional term logic and the [[predicate calculus]] that is the fundamental advance of modern logic.  The formula ''A(P,Q)'' (all Ps are Qs) of traditional logic corresponds to the more complex formula <math>\\forall x (P(x) \\rightarrow Q(x))</math> in predicate logic, involving the logical connectives for [[universal quantification]] and [[material conditional|implication]] rather than just the predicate letter ''A'' and using variable arguments <math>P(x)</math> where traditional logic uses just the term letter ''P''.  With the complexity comes power, and the advent of the predicate calculus inaugurated revolutionary growth of the subject.\n\n=== Semantics ===\n{{main|Semantics of logic}}\n\nThe validity of an argument depends upon the meaning or ''semantics'' of the sentences that make it up.\n\nAristotle's [[Organon]], especially ''[[De Interpretatione]]'', gives a cursory outline of semantics which the [[scholastic logic]]ians, particularly in the thirteenth and fourteenth century, developed into a complex and sophisticated theory, called [[Supposition theory]].  This showed how the truth of simple sentences, expressed schematically, depend on how the terms 'supposit' or ''stand for'' certain extra-linguistic items.  For example, in part II of his [[Sum of Logic|Summa Logicae]], [[William of Ockham]] presents a comprehensive account of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of simple sentences, in order to show which arguments are valid and which are not.  Thus \"every A is B' is true if and only if there is something for which 'A' stands, and there is nothing for which 'A' stands, for which 'B' does not also stand.\"<ref>''Summa Logicae'' Part II c.4 transl. as ''Ockam's Theory of Propositions'', A. Freddoso and H. Schuurman, St Augustine's Press 1998, p. 96</ref>\n\nEarly modern logic defined semantics purely as a relation between ideas.  [[Antoine Arnauld]] in the ''[[Port Royal-Logic]]'', says that 'after conceiving things by our ideas, we compare these ideas, and, finding that some belong together and some do not, we unite or separate them. This is called ''affirming'' or ''denying'', and in general ''judging''.<ref>Arnauld, ''Logic or the Art of Thinking'' Part 2 Chapter 3.</ref> Thus truth and falsity are no more than the agreement or disagreement of ideas.  This suggests obvious difficulties, leading [[John Locke|Locke]] to distinguish between 'real' truth, when our ideas have 'real existence' and 'imaginary' or 'verbal' truth, where ideas like harpies or centaurs exist only in the mind.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Locke |first=John |title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding |title-link=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding |year=1690 |at=IV, v. 1-8 |author-link=John Locke}}</ref> This view ([[psychologism]]) was taken to the extreme in the nineteenth century, and is generally held by modern logicians to signify a low point in the decline of logic before the twentieth century.\n\nModern semantics is in some ways closer to the medieval view, in rejecting such psychological truth-conditions.  However, the introduction of [[quantifier (logic)|quantification]], needed to solve the [[problem of multiple generality]], rendered impossible the kind of subject-predicate analysis that underlies medieval semantics.  The main modern approach is ''model-theoretic semantics'', based on [[Alfred Tarski]]'s [[semantic theory of truth]].  The approach assumes that the meaning of the various parts of the propositions are given by the possible ways we can give a recursively specified group of [[interpretation function]]s from them to some predefined [[domain of discourse]]: an interpretation of [[first-order predicate logic]] is given by a mapping from terms to a universe of [[individual]]s, and a mapping from propositions to the truth values \"true\" and \"false\".  Model-theoretic semantics is one of the fundamental concepts of [[model theory]].  Modern semantics also admits rival approaches, such as the [[proof-theoretic semantics]] that associates the meaning of propositions with the roles that they can play in inferences, an approach that ultimately derives from the work of [[Gerhard Gentzen]] on [[structural proof theory]] and is heavily influenced by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s later philosophy, especially his aphorism \"meaning is use\".\n\n===Inference===\n''Inference'' is not to be confused with ''implication''.  An implication is a sentence of the form 'If p then q', and can be true or false.  [[Stoic logic|The Stoic logician]] [[Philo the Dialectician|Philo of Megara]] was the first to define the truth conditions of such an implication: false only when the antecedent p is true and the consequent q is false, in all other cases true.  An inference, on the other hand, consists of two separately asserted propositions of the form 'p therefore q'.  An inference is not true or false, but valid or invalid.  However, there is a connection between implication and inference, as follows: if the implication 'if p then q' is ''true'', the inference 'p therefore q' is ''valid''.  This was given an apparently paradoxical formulation by Philo, who said that the implication 'if it is day, it is night' is true only at night, so the inference 'it is day, therefore it is night' is valid in the night, but not in the day.\n\nThe theory of inference (or 'consequences') was systematically developed in medieval times by logicians such as [[William of Ockham]] and [[Walter Burley]].  It is uniquely medieval, though it has its origins in Aristotle's [[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]] and [[Boethius]]' ''De Syllogismis hypotheticis''.  This is why many terms in logic are Latin.  For example, the rule that licenses the move from the implication 'if p then q' plus the assertion of its antecedent p, to the assertion of the consequent q is known as [[modus ponens]] (or 'mode of positing').  Its Latin formulation is 'Posito antecedente ponitur consequens'.  The Latin formulations of many other rules such as 'ex falso quodlibet' (anything follows from a falsehood), 'reductio ad absurdum' (disproof by showing the consequence is absurd) also date from this period.\n\nHowever, the theory of consequences, or of the so-called '[[hypothetical syllogism]]' was never fully integrated into the theory of the 'categorical syllogism'.  This was partly because of the resistance to reducing the categorical judgment 'Every S is P' to the so-called hypothetical judgment 'if anything is S, it is P'.  The first was thought to imply 'some S is P', the second was not, and as late as 1911 in the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] article on Logic, we find the Oxford logician T.H. Case arguing against Sigwart's and Brentano's modern analysis of the universal proposition.\n\n===Logical systems===\n{{main|Formal system}}\nA formal system is an organization of terms used for the analysis of deduction. It consists of an alphabet, a language over the alphabet to construct sentences, and a rule for deriving sentences. Among the important properties that [[logical system]]s can have are:\n* '''[[Consistency]]''', which means that no theorem of the system contradicts another.<ref name=\"Bergmann, Merrie 2009\" />\n* '''[[Validity (logic)|Validity]]''', which means that the system's rules of proof never allow a false inference from true premises.\n* '''[[completeness (logic)|Completeness]]''', which means that if a formula is true, it can be proven, i.e. is a ''theorem'' of the system.\n* '''[[Soundness]]''', meaning that if any formula is a theorem of the system, it is true. This is the converse of completeness. (Note that in a distinct philosophical use of the term, an argument is sound when it is both valid and its premises are true).<ref>''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://www.iep.utm.edu/val-snd/ Validity and Soundness]</ref>\n* '''[[Expressive power (computer science)|Expressivity]]''', meaning what concepts can be expressed in the system.\n\nSome logical systems do not have all four properties. As an example, [[Kurt G\u00f6del]]'s [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]] show that sufficiently complex formal systems of arithmetic cannot be consistent and complete;<ref name=\"Hamilton\" /> however, first-order predicate logics not extended by specific [[axiom]]s to be arithmetic formal systems with equality can be complete and consistent.<ref name=\"Introduction to Mathematical Logic\" />\n\n===Logic and rationality===\n{{main|Logic and rationality}}\n{{confusing|section|date=May 2016}}\nAs the study of argument is of clear importance to the reasons that we hold things to be true, logic is of essential importance to [[rationality]].  Here we have defined logic to be \"the systematic study of the form of arguments\"; the reasoning behind argument is of several sorts, but only some of these arguments fall under the aegis of logic proper.\n\n[[Deductive reasoning]] concerns the [[logical consequence]] of given premises and is the form of reasoning most closely connected to logic. On a narrow conception of logic (see below) logic concerns just deductive reasoning, although such a narrow conception controversially excludes most of what is called informal logic from the discipline.\n\nThere are other forms of reasoning that are rational but that are generally not taken to be part of logic.  These include [[inductive reasoning]], which covers forms of inference that move from collections of particular judgements to universal judgements, and [[abductive reasoning]],<ref name=\"abduction\">On [[abductive reasoning]], see:\n* Magnani, L.

The American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839\u20131914) first introduced the term as \"guessing\".<ref name=\"guess\">See [http://www.commens.org/dictionary/term/abduction Abduction] and [http://www.commens.org/dictionary/term/retroduction Retroduction] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115846/http://www.commens.org/dictionary/term/retroduction |date=26 August 2014 }} at ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms'', and see Peirce's papers:\n* \"On the Logic of drawing History from Ancient Documents especially from Testimonies\" (1901), ''Collected Papers'' v. 7, paragraph 219.\n* \"PAP\" [\"Prolegomena to an Apology for Pragmatism\"], MS 293 c. 1906, ''New Elements of Mathematics'' v. 4, pp. 319\u2013320.\n* A Letter to F.A. Woods (1913), ''Collected Papers'' v. 8, paragraphs 385\u2013388.</ref> Peirce said that to ''abduce'' a hypothetical explanation <math>a</math> from an observed surprising circumstance <math>b</math> is to surmise that <math>a</math> may be true because then <math>b</math> would be a matter of course.<ref name=\"HL\">Peirce, C.S. (1903), Harvard lectures on pragmatism, ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, [http://www.textlog.de/7664-2.html paragraphs 188\u2013189].</ref> Thus, to abduce <math>a</math> from <math>b</math> involves determining that <math>a</math> is [[necessary and sufficient conditions|sufficient (or nearly sufficient), but not necessary]], for <math>b</math>.\n\nWhile inductive and abductive inference are not part of logic proper, the methodology of logic has been applied to them with some degree of success.  For example, the notion of deductive validity (where an inference is deductively valid [[if and only if]] there is no possible situation in which all the premises are true but the conclusion false) exists in an analogy to the notion of inductive validity, or \"strength\", where an inference is inductively strong if and only if its premises give some degree of probability to its conclusion.  Whereas the notion of deductive validity can be rigorously stated for systems of formal logic in terms of the well-understood notions of [[semantics]], inductive validity requires us to define a reliable generalization of some set of observations. The task of providing this definition may be approached in various ways, some less formal than others; some of these definitions may use logical association [[rule induction]], while others may use [[mathematical model]]s of probability such as [[decision tree]]s.\n\n===Rival conceptions===\n{{Main|Conceptions of logic}}\nLogic arose (see below) from a concern with correctness of [[argumentation]]. Modern logicians usually wish to ensure that logic studies just those arguments that arise from appropriately general forms of inference. For example, Thomas Hofweber writes in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' that logic \"does not, however, cover good reasoning as a whole. That is the job of the theory of [[rationality]]. Rather it deals with inferences whose validity can be traced back to the formal features of the representations that are involved in that inference, be they linguistic, mental, or other representations.\"<ref name=\"stanford-logic-onthology\" />\n\nThe idea that logic treats special forms of argument, deductive argument, rather than argument in general, has a history in logic that dates back at least to [[logicism]] in mathematics (19th and 20th centuries) and the advent of the influence of mathematical logic on philosophy.  A consequence of taking logic to treat special kinds of argument is that it leads to identification of special kinds of truth, the logical truths (with logic equivalently being the study of logical truth), and excludes many of the original objects of study of logic that are treated as informal logic.  [[Robert Brandom]] has argued against the idea that logic is the study of a special kind of logical truth, arguing that instead one can talk of the logic of [[material inference]] (in the terminology of [[Wilfred Sellars]]), with logic making explicit the commitments that were originally implicit in informal inference.<ref name=\"brandom-2000\" />{{page needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of logic}}\n[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Aristotle]], 384\u2013322&nbsp;BCE.]]\nLogic comes from the Greek word ''logos'', originally meaning \"the word\" or \"what is spoken\", but coming to mean \"thought\" or \"reason\". In the Western World, logic was first developed by [[Aristotle]], who called the subject 'analytics'.<ref name=\"achievement\" /> [[Aristotelian logic]] became widely accepted in science and mathematics and remained in wide use in the West until the early 19th&nbsp;century.<ref name=\"mtu\" /> Aristotle's system of logic was responsible for the introduction of [[hypothetical syllogism]],<ref name=\"google\" /> [[Temporal logic|temporal]] [[modal logic]],<ref name=\"google1\" /><ref name=\"google2\" /> and [[Inductive reasoning|inductive logic]],<ref name=\"google3\" /> as well as influential vocabulary such as [[terminology|terms]], [[predicable]]s, [[syllogism]]s and [[proposition]]s. There was also the rival [[Stoic logic]].\n\nIn [[Europe]] during the later medieval period, major efforts were made to show that Aristotle's ideas were compatible with [[Christianity|Christian]] faith. During the [[High Middle Ages]], logic became a main focus of philosophers, who would engage in critical logical analyses of philosophical arguments, often using variations of the methodology of [[scholasticism]]. In 1323, [[William of Ockham]]'s influential ''[[Sum of Logic|Summa Logicae]]'' was released. By the 18th century, the structured approach to arguments had degenerated and fallen out of favour, as depicted in [[Ludvig Holberg|Holberg]]'s satirical play ''[[Erasmus Montanus]]''.\nThe [[Logic in China|Chinese logical]] philosopher [[Gongsun Long]] ({{nowrap|c. 325\u2013250 BCE}}) proposed the paradox \"One and one cannot become two, since neither becomes two.\"<ref name=\"propositions\" /> In China, the tradition of scholarly investigation into logic, however, was repressed by the [[Qin dynasty]] following the legalist philosophy of [[Han Feizi]].\n\nIn India, the [[Anviksiki]] school of logic was founded by [[Indian logic|Medhatithi Gautama]] (c. 6th century BCE).<ref>S.C. Vidyabhusana (1971). ''A History of Indian Logic: Ancient, Mediaeval, and Modern Schools'', pp. 17\u201321.</ref> Innovations in the scholastic school, called [[Nyaya]], continued from ancient times into the early 18th&nbsp;century with the [[Navya-Nyaya]] school. By the 16th&nbsp;century, it developed theories resembling modern logic, such as [[Gottlob Frege]]'s \"distinction between sense and reference of proper names\" and his \"definition of number\", as well as the theory of \"restrictive conditions for universals\" anticipating some of the developments in modern [[set theory]].<ref name=\"Chakrabarti\" /> Since 1824, Indian logic attracted the attention of many Western scholars, and has had an influence on important 19th-century logicians such as [[Charles Babbage]], [[Augustus De Morgan]], and [[George Boole]].<ref name=\"Indian logic: a reader\" /> In the 20th&nbsp;century, Western philosophers like Stanislaw Schayer and Klaus Glashoff have explored Indian logic more extensively.\n\nThe [[Syllogism|syllogistic]] logic developed by Aristotle predominated in the West until the mid-19th&nbsp;century, when interest in the [[foundations of mathematics]] stimulated the development of symbolic logic (now called [[mathematical logic]]). In 1854, George Boole published ''[[The Laws of Thought|An Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities]]'', introducing symbolic logic and the principles of what is now known as [[Boolean logic]]. In 1879, Gottlob Frege published ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'', which inaugurated modern logic with the invention of [[Quantification (logic)|quantifier]] notation, reconciling the Aristotelian and Stoic logics in a broader system, and solving such problems for which Aristotelian logic was impotent, such as the [[problem of multiple generality]]. From 1910 to 1913, [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] published ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''<ref name=\"Principia\" /> on the foundations of mathematics, attempting to derive mathematical truths from [[axiom]]s and [[inference rule]]s in symbolic logic. In 1931, [[G\u00f6del]] raised serious problems with the foundationalist program and logic ceased to focus on such issues.\n\nThe development of logic since Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein had a profound influence on the practice of philosophy and the perceived nature of philosophical problems (see [[analytic philosophy]]) and [[philosophy of mathematics]]. Logic, especially sentential logic, is implemented in computer [[Digital electronics|logic circuits]] and is fundamental to [[computer science]]. Logic is commonly taught by university philosophy, sociology, advertising and literature departments, often as a compulsory discipline.\n\n=={{vanchor|Types}}==\n===Syllogistic logic===\n{{main|Aristotelian logic}}\n[[File:Johannesmagistris-square.jpg|thumb|A depiction from the 15th century of the [[square of opposition]], which expresses the fundamental dualities of syllogistic.]]\n\nThe ''[[Organon]]'' was [[Aristotle]]'s body of work on logic, with the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'' constituting the first explicit work in formal logic, introducing the syllogistic.<ref name=\"Aristotle\" /> The parts of syllogistic logic, also known by the name [[term logic]], are the analysis of the judgements into propositions consisting of two terms that are related by one of a fixed number of relations, and the expression of inferences by means of [[syllogism]]s that consist of two propositions sharing a common term as premise, and a conclusion that is a proposition involving the two unrelated terms from the premises.\n\nAristotle's work was regarded in classical times and from medieval times in Europe and the Middle East as the very picture of a fully worked out system. However, it was not alone: the [[Stoics]] proposed a system of [[propositional logic]] that was studied by medieval logicians. Also, the [[problem of multiple generality]] was recognized in medieval times. Nonetheless, problems with syllogistic logic were not seen as being in need of revolutionary solutions.\n\nToday, some academics claim that Aristotle's system is generally seen as having little more than historical value (though there is some current interest in extending term logics), regarded as made obsolete by the advent of propositional logic and the [[predicate calculus]]. Others use Aristotle in [[argumentation theory]] to help develop and critically question argumentation schemes that are used in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[legal]] arguments.\n\n===Propositional logic===\n{{main|Propositional calculus}}\nA propositional calculus or logic (also a sentential calculus) is a formal system in which formulae representing propositions can be formed by combining [[atomic propositions]] using [[logical connectives]], and in which a system of formal proof rules establishes certain formulae as \"theorems\".  An example of a theorem of propositional logic is <math>A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow A</math>, which says that if A holds, then B implies A.\n\n===Predicate logic===\n[[File:BS-12-Begriffsschrift Quantifier1-svg.svg|thumb|[[Gottlob Frege]]'s ''[[Begriffschrift]]'' introduced the notion of quantifier in a graphical notation, which here represents the judgement that <math>\\forall x. F(x)</math> is true.]]\n{{main|Predicate logic}}\nPredicate logic is the generic term for symbolic formal systems such as [[first-order logic]], [[second-order logic]], [[many-sorted logic]], and [[infinitary logic]].  It provides an account of [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]] general enough to express a wide set of arguments occurring in natural language.   For example, [[Bertrand Russell]]'s famous [[barber paradox]], \"there is a man who shaves all and only men who do not shave themselves\" can be formalised by the sentence <math>(\\exists x ) (\\text{man}(x) \\wedge (\\forall y) (\\text{man}(y) \\rightarrow (\\text{shaves}(x, y)  \\leftrightarrow \\neg \\text{shaves}(y, y))))</math>, using the non-logical predicate <math>\\text{man}(x)</math> to indicate that ''x'' is a man, and the non-logical relation <math>\\text{shaves}(x, y)</math> to indicate that ''x'' shaves ''y''; all other symbols of the formulae are logical, expressing the universal and existential [[quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]], [[logical conjunction|conjunction]], [[Material conditional|implication]], [[negation]] and [[biconditional]].\n\nWhilst Aristotelian syllogistic logic specifies a small number of forms that the relevant part of the involved judgements may take, predicate logic allows sentences to be analysed into subject and argument in several additional ways\u2014allowing predicate logic to solve the [[problem of multiple generality]] that had perplexed medieval logicians.\n\nThe development of predicate logic is usually attributed to [[Gottlob Frege]], who is also credited as one of the founders of [[analytic philosophy]], but the formulation of predicate logic most often used today is the first-order logic presented in [[Principles of Mathematical Logic]] by [[David Hilbert]] and [[Wilhelm Ackermann]] in 1928. The analytical generality of predicate logic allowed the formalization of mathematics, drove the investigation of [[set theory]], and allowed the development of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s approach to [[model theory]]. It provides the foundation of modern [[mathematical logic]].\n\nFrege's original system of predicate logic was second-order, rather than first-order. [[Second-order logic]] is most prominently defended (against the criticism of [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] and others) by [[George Boolos]] and [[Stewart Shapiro]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Modal logic===\n{{main|Modal logic}}\nIn languages, [[Linguistic modality|modality]] deals with the phenomenon that sub-parts of a sentence may have their semantics modified by special verbs or modal particles. For example, \"''We go to the games''\" can be modified to give \"''We should go to the games''\", and \"''We can go to the games''\" and perhaps \"''We will go to the games''\". More abstractly, we might say that modality affects the circumstances in which we take an assertion to be satisfied. Confusing modality is known as the [[modal fallacy]].\n\n[[Aristotle]]'s logic is in large parts concerned with the theory of non-modalized logic. Although, there are passages in his work, such as the famous [[problem of future contingents|sea-battle argument]] in ''[[De Interpretatione]]'' \u00a7 9, that are now seen as anticipations of modal logic and its connection with [[potentiality]] and time, the earliest formal system of modal logic was developed by [[Avicenna]], who ultimately developed a theory of \"[[Temporal logic|temporally]] [[Modal logic|modalized]]\" syllogistic.<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 |title=History of logic: Arabic logic |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]}}</ref>\n\nWhile the study of necessity and possibility remained important to philosophers, little logical innovation happened until the landmark investigations of [[C. I. Lewis]] in 1918, who formulated a family of rival axiomatizations of the [[Alethic modality|alethic modalities]]. His work unleashed a torrent of new work on the topic, expanding the kinds of modality treated to include [[deontic logic]] and [[epistemic logic]].  The seminal work of [[Arthur Prior]] applied the same formal language to treat [[temporal logic]] and paved the way for the marriage of the two subjects. [[Saul Kripke]] discovered (contemporaneously with rivals) his theory of [[Kripke semantics|frame semantics]], which revolutionized the formal technology available to modal logicians and gave a new [[graph theory|graph-theoretic]] way of looking at modality that has driven many applications in [[computational linguistics]] and [[computer science]], such as [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]].\n\n===Informal reasoning and dialectic===\n{{main|Informal logic|Logic and dialectic}}\nThe motivation for the study of logic in ancient times was clear: it is so that one may learn to distinguish good arguments from bad arguments, and so become more effective in argument and oratory, and perhaps also to become a better person. Half of the works of Aristotle's [[Organon]] treat inference as it occurs in an informal setting, side by side with the development of the syllogistic, and in the Aristotelian school, these informal works on logic were seen as complementary to Aristotle's treatment of [[rhetoric]].\n\nThis ancient motivation is still alive, although it no longer takes centre stage in the picture of logic; typically [[dialectic]]al logic forms the heart of a course in [[critical thinking]], a compulsory course at many universities.  Dialectic has been linked to logic since ancient times, but it has not been until recent decades that European and American logicians have attempted to provide mathematical foundations for logic and dialectic by formalising dialectical logic. [[Dialectical logic]] is also the name given to the special treatment of dialectic in [[Hegel]]ian and [[Marx]]ist thought.  There have been pre-formal treatises on argument and dialectic, from authors such as [[Stephen Toulmin]] (''The Uses of Argument''), [[Nicholas Rescher]] (''Dialectics''),<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Rescher |first=Nicholas |date=1978 |title=Dialectics: A Controversy-Oriented Approach to the Theory of Knowledge |url=http://ojs.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/article/view/2809 |journal=Informal Logic |volume=1 |issue=#3}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hetherington |first=Stephen |date=2006 |title=Nicholas Rescher: Philosophical Dialectics |url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/25075-philosophical-dialectics-an-essay-on-metaphilosophy/ |journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews |issue=2006.07.16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Rescher |first=Nicholas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T65moyMMioYC |title=Reason, Method, and Value: A Reader on the Philosophy of Nicholas Rescher |date=2009 |publisher=Ontos Verlag |isbn=978-3-11-032905-6 |editor-last=Jacquette, Dale}}</ref> and van Eemeren and Grootendorst ([[Pragma-dialectics]]).  Theories of [[defeasible reasoning]] can provide a foundation for the formalisation of dialectical logic and dialectic itself can be formalised as moves in a game, where an advocate for the truth of a proposition and an opponent argue.  Such games can provide a formal [[game semantics]] for many logics.\n\n[[Argumentation theory]] is the study and research of informal logic, fallacies, and critical questions as they relate to every day and practical situations. Specific types of dialogue can be analyzed and questioned to reveal premises, conclusions, and fallacies. Argumentation theory is now applied in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[law]].\n\n===Mathematical logic===\n{{main|Mathematical logic}}\nMathematical logic comprises two distinct areas of research: the first is the application of the techniques of formal logic to mathematics and mathematical reasoning, and the second, in the other direction, the application of mathematical techniques to the representation and analysis of formal logic.<ref name=\"Introduction to Elementary Mathematical Logic\" />\n\nThe earliest use of mathematics and [[geometry]] in relation to logic and philosophy goes back to the ancient Greeks such as [[Euclid]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]].<ref name=\"The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle\" /> Many other ancient and medieval philosophers applied mathematical ideas and methods to their philosophical claims.<ref name=\"Prior Analytics\" />\n\nOne of the boldest attempts to apply logic to mathematics was the [[logicism]] pioneered by philosopher-logicians such as [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]. Mathematical theories were supposed to be logical [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], and the programme was to show this by means of a reduction of mathematics to logic.<ref name=\"Principia\" /> The various attempts to carry this out met with failure, from the crippling of Frege's project in his ''Grundgesetze'' by [[Russell's paradox]], to the defeat of [[Hilbert's program]] by [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem]]s.\n\nBoth the statement of Hilbert's program and its refutation by G\u00f6del depended upon their work establishing the second area of mathematical logic, the application of mathematics to logic in the form of [[proof theory]].<ref name=\"Introduction to Mathematical Logic5\" /> Despite the negative nature of the incompleteness theorems, [[G\u00f6del's completeness theorem]], a result in [[model theory]] and another application of mathematics to logic, can be understood as showing how close logicism came to being true: every rigorously defined mathematical theory can be exactly captured by a first-order logical theory; Frege's [[proof calculus]] is enough to ''describe'' the whole of mathematics, though not ''equivalent'' to it.\n\nIf proof theory and model theory have been the foundation of mathematical logic, they have been but two of the four pillars of the subject.<ref>Barwise (1982) divides the subject of mathematical logic into model theory, proof theory, set theory and recursion theory.</ref> [[Set theory]] originated in the study of the infinite by [[Georg Cantor]], and it has been the source of many of the most challenging and important issues in mathematical logic, from [[Cantor's theorem]], through the status of the [[Axiom of Choice]] and the question of the independence of the [[continuum hypothesis]], to the modern debate on [[large cardinal]] axioms.\n\n[[Recursion theory]] captures the idea of computation in logical and [[arithmetic]] terms; its most classical achievements are the undecidability of the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] by [[Alan Turing]], and his presentation of the [[Church\u2013Turing thesis]].<ref name=\"Theory of computation: formal languages, automata, and complexity\" /> Today recursion theory is mostly concerned with the more refined problem of [[complexity class]]es\u2014when is a problem efficiently solvable?\u2014and the classification of [[Turing degree|degrees of unsolvability]].<ref name=\"Theory of computation: formal languages, automata, and complexity6\" />\n\n===Philosophical logic===\n{{main|Philosophical logic}}\n[[Philosophical logic]] deals with formal descriptions of ordinary, non-specialist [[Natural language|(\"natural\") language]], that is strictly only about the arguments within philosophy's other branches. Most philosophers assume that the bulk of everyday<!--was: \"normal\" proper--> reasoning can be captured in logic if a method or methods to translate ordinary language into that logic can be found. Philosophical logic is essentially a continuation of the traditional discipline called \"logic\" before the invention of mathematical logic. Philosophical logic has a much greater concern with the connection between natural language and logic. As a result, philosophical logicians have contributed a great deal to the development of non-standard logics (e.g. [[free logic]]s, [[tense logic]]s) as well as various extensions of [[classical logic]] (e.g. [[modal logic]]s) and non-standard semantics for such logics (e.g. [[Saul Kripke|Kripke]]'s [[supervaluationism]] in the semantics of logic).\n\nLogic and the philosophy of language are closely related. Philosophy of language has to do with the study of how our language engages and interacts with our thinking. Logic has an immediate impact on other areas of study. Studying logic and the relationship between logic and ordinary speech can help a person better structure his own arguments and critique the arguments of others. Many popular arguments are filled with errors because so many people are untrained in logic and unaware of how to formulate an argument correctly.<ref>{{Citation |last=Goldman |first=Alvin I. |title=Epistemology and Cognition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9XwhBw2jMqMC&pg=PA293 |page=293 |year=1986 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-25896-9 |quote=untrained subjects are prone to commit various sorts of fallacies and mistakes}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |title=Intelligence, Mind, and Reasoning: Structure and Development |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HkukZOU2pzIC&pg=PA194 |volume=106 |page=194 |year=1994 |editor-last=Demetriou |editor-first=A. |series=Advances in Psychology |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-08-086760-1 |editor2-last=Efklides |editor2-first=A.}}</ref>\n\n===Computational logic===\n{{main|Computational logic|Logic in computer science}}\n[[File:Register transfer level - example toggler.svg|right|thumb|300px\n|A simple toggling circuit is expressed using a logic gate and a synchronous register.]]\nLogic cut to the heart of computer science as it emerged as a discipline: [[Alan Turing]]'s work on the ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' followed from [[Kurt G\u00f6del]]'s work on the [[incompleteness theorems]]. The notion of the general purpose computer that came from this work was of fundamental importance to the designers of the computer machinery in the 1940s.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, researchers predicted that when human knowledge could be expressed using logic with [[mathematical notation]], it would be possible to create a machine that mimics the problem-solving skills of a human being. This was more difficult than expected because of the complexity of human reasoning. In the summer of 1956, [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]], [[Marvin Minsky]], [[Claude Shannon]] and [[Nathaniel Rochester (computer scientist)|Nathan Rochester]] organized a conference on the subject of what they called \"[[artificial intelligence]]\" (a term coined by McCarthy for the occasion). Newell and Simon proudly presented the group with the [[Logic Theorist]] and were somewhat surprised when the program received a lukewarm reception.\n\nIn [[logic programming]], a program consists of a set of axioms and rules. Logic programming systems such as [[Prolog]] compute the consequences of the axioms and rules in order to answer a query.\n\nToday, logic is extensively applied in the field of artificial intelligence, and this field provide a rich source of problems in formal and informal logic. [[Argumentation theory]] is one good example of how logic is being applied to artificial intelligence. The [[ACM Computing Classification System]] in particular regards:\n* Section F.3 on \"Logics and meanings of programs\" and F.4 on \"Mathematical logic and formal languages\" as part of the theory of computer science: this work covers [[formal semantics of programming languages]], as well as work of [[formal methods]] such as [[Hoare logic]];\n* [[Boolean logic]] as fundamental to computer hardware: particularly, the system's section B.2 on \"[[Arithmetic and logic structures]]\", relating to operatives [[logical conjunction|AND]], [[negation|NOT]], and [[logical disjunction|OR]];\n* Many fundamental logical formalisms are essential to section I.2 on artificial intelligence, for example [[modal logic]] and [[default logic]] in [[Knowledge representation formalisms and methods]], [[Horn clause]]s in logic programming, and [[description logic]].\n\nFurthermore, computers can be used as tools for logicians. For example, in symbolic logic and mathematical logic, proofs by humans can be computer-assisted. Using [[automated theorem proving]], the machines can find and check proofs, as well as work with proofs too lengthy to write out by hand.\n\n===Non-classical logic===\n{{Main|Non-classical logic}}\nThe logics discussed above are all \"[[Principle of bivalence|bivalent]]\" or \"two-valued\"; that is, they are most naturally understood as dividing propositions into true and false propositions. [[Non-classical logic]]s are those systems that reject various rules of [[Classical logic]].\n\nHegel developed his own [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectic logic]] that extended [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s transcendental logic but also brought it back to ground by assuring us that \"neither in heaven nor in earth, neither in the world of mind nor of nature, is there anywhere such an abstract 'either\u2013or' as the understanding maintains. Whatever exists is concrete, with difference and opposition in itself\".<ref name=\"philosophical\" />\n\nIn 1910, [[Nicolai A. Vasiliev]] extended the law of excluded middle and the law of contradiction and proposed the law of excluded fourth and logic tolerant to contradiction.<ref name=\"Brenner2008\" /> In the early 20th&nbsp;century [[Jan \u0141ukasiewicz]] investigated the extension of the traditional true/false values to include a third value, \"possible\" (or an indeterminate, a hypothesis) so inventing [[ternary logic]], the first [[multi-valued logic]] in the Western tradition.<ref>{{Citation |last=Zegarelli |first=Mark |title=Logic For Dummies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xm0-0Rs2GVoC&pg=PA30 |page=30 |year=2010 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-1-118-05307-2}}</ref> \nA minor modification of the ternary logic was later introduced in a sibling ternary logic model proposed by [[Stephen Cole Kleene]]. Kleene's system differs from the \u0141ukasiewicz's logic with respect to an outcome of the implication. The former assumes that the operator of [[material conditional|implication]] between two hypotheses produces a hypothesis.\n\nLogics such as [[fuzzy logic]] have since been devised with an infinite number of \"degrees of truth\", represented by a [[real number]] between 0 and 1.<ref name=\"stanford\" />\n\n[[Intuitionistic logic]] was proposed by [[L.E.J. Brouwer]] as the correct logic for reasoning about mathematics, based upon his rejection of the [[law of the excluded middle]] as part of his [[intuitionism]]. Brouwer rejected formalization in mathematics, but his student [[Arend Heyting]] studied intuitionistic logic formally, as did [[Gerhard Gentzen]]. Intuitionistic logic is of great interest to computer scientists, as it is a [[constructive logic]] and sees many applications, such as extracting verified programs from proofs and influencing the design of [[programming language]]s through the [[formulae-as-types correspondence]].\n\n[[Modal logic]] is not truth conditional, and so it has often been proposed as a non-classical logic. However, modal logic is normally formalized with the principle of the excluded middle, and its [[relational semantics]] is bivalent, so this inclusion is disputable.\n\n==Controversies==\n===\"Is Logic Empirical?\"===\n{{details|Is Logic Empirical?}}\nWhat is the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] status of the [[Classical logic|laws of logic]]? What sort of argument is appropriate for criticizing purported principles of logic? In an influential paper entitled \"[[Is Logic Empirical?]]\"<ref name=\"Is Logic Empirical?\" /> [[Hilary Putnam]], building on a suggestion of [[W. V. Quine]], argued that in general the facts of propositional logic have a similar epistemological status as facts about the physical universe, for example as the laws of [[mechanics]] or of [[general relativity]], and in particular that what physicists have learned about quantum mechanics provides a compelling case for abandoning certain familiar principles of classical logic: if we want to be [[philosophical realism|realists]] about the physical phenomena described by quantum theory, then we should abandon the [[principle of distributivity]], substituting for classical logic the [[quantum logic]] proposed by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[John von Neumann]].<ref name=\"The Logic of Quantum Mechanics\" />\n\nAnother paper of the same name by [[Michael Dummett]] argues that Putnam's desire for realism mandates the law of distributivity.<ref name=\"Truth and Other Enigmas\" /> Distributivity of logic is essential for the realist's understanding of how propositions are true of the world in just the same way as he has argued the principle of bivalence is. In this way, the question, \"Is Logic Empirical?\" can be seen to lead naturally into the fundamental controversy in [[metaphysics]] on [[realism versus anti-realism]].\n\n===Implication: Strict or material===\n{{main|Paradoxes of material implication}}\nThe notion of implication formalized in classical logic does not comfortably translate into natural language by means of \"if&nbsp;... then&nbsp;...\", due to a number of problems called the [[paradoxes of material implication]].\n\nThe first class of paradoxes involves counterfactuals, such as ''If the moon is made of green cheese, then 2+2=5'', which are puzzling because natural language does not support the [[principle of explosion]]. Eliminating this class of paradoxes was the reason for [[C. I. Lewis]]'s formulation of [[strict implication]], which eventually led to more radically revisionist logics such as [[relevance logic]].\n\nThe second class of paradoxes involves redundant premises, falsely suggesting that we know the succedent because of the antecedent: thus \"if that man gets elected, granny will die\" is materially true since granny is mortal, regardless of the man's election prospects. Such sentences violate the [[Gricean maxim]] of relevance, and can be modelled by logics that reject the principle of [[monotonicity of entailment]], such as relevance logic.\n\n===Tolerating the impossible===\n{{main|Paraconsistent logic}}\n[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] was deeply critical of any simplified notion of the [[law of non-contradiction]]. It was based on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]'s idea that this law of logic also requires a sufficient ground to specify from what point of view (or time) one says that something cannot contradict itself. A building, for example, both moves and does not move; the ground for the first is our solar system and for the second the earth. In Hegelian dialectic, the law of non-contradiction, of identity, itself relies upon difference and so is not independently assertable.\n\nClosely related to questions arising from the paradoxes of implication comes the suggestion that logic ought to tolerate [[inconsistency]]. [[Relevance logic]] and [[paraconsistent logic]] are the most important approaches here, though the concerns are different: a key consequence of [[classical logic]] and some of its rivals, such as [[intuitionistic logic]], is that they respect the [[principle of explosion]], which means that the logic collapses if it is capable of deriving a contradiction. [[Graham Priest]], the main proponent of [[dialetheism]], has argued for paraconsistency on the grounds that there are in fact, true contradictions.<ref name=\"stanford7\" />{{clarify|this is a provocative statement that deserves an inline example or Wikipedia explanation of some sort|date=October 2016}}\n\n===Rejection of logical truth===\nThe philosophical vein of various kinds of skepticism contains many kinds of doubt and rejection of the various bases on which logic rests, such as the idea of logical form, correct inference, or meaning, typically leading to the conclusion that there are no [[logical truth]]s. This is in contrast with the usual views in [[philosophical skepticism]], where logic directs skeptical enquiry to doubt received wisdoms, as in the work of [[Sextus Empiricus]].\n\n[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] provides a strong example of the rejection of the usual basis of logic: his radical rejection of idealization led him to reject truth as a \"...&nbsp;mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms\u2014in short&nbsp;... metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins.\"<ref name=\"nietzsche\" /> His rejection of truth did not lead him to reject the idea of either inference or logic completely, but rather suggested that \"logic [came] into existence in man's head [out] of illogic, whose realm originally must have been immense. Innumerable beings who made inferences in a way different from ours perished\".<ref name=\"nietzsche8\" /> Thus there is the idea that logical inference has a use as a tool for human survival, but that its existence does not support the existence of truth, nor does it have a reality beyond the instrumental: \"Logic, too, also rests on assumptions that do not correspond to anything in the real world\".<ref name=\"nietzsche9\" />\n\nThis position held by Nietzsche however, has come under extreme scrutiny for several reasons. Some philosophers, such as [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]], claim his position is self-refuting\u2014and accuse Nietzsche of not even having a coherent perspective, let alone a theory of knowledge.<ref name=\"nietzsche10\" /> [[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs|Georg Luk\u00e1cs]], in his book ''The Destruction of Reason'', asserts that, \"Were we to study Nietzsche's statements in this area from a logico-philosophical angle, we would be confronted by a dizzy chaos of the most lurid assertions, arbitrary and violently incompatible.\"<ref name=\"marxists\" /> [[Bertrand Russell]] described Nietzsche's irrational claims with \"He is fond of expressing himself paradoxically and with a view to shocking conventional readers\" in his book ''A History of Western Philosophy''.<ref>{{Citation |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=A History of Western Philosophy And Its Connection with Political and Social Circumstances from the Earliest Times to the Present Day |url=http://www.ntslibrary.com/PDF%20Books/History%20of%20Western%20Philosophy.pdf/ |page=762 |df=dmy-all |year=1945 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528221822/http://www.ntslibrary.com/PDF%20Books/History%20of%20Western%20Philosophy.pdf |publisher=Simon and Schuster |archive-date=28 May 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n{{Wikipedia books}}\n\n{{Columns-list|\n* {{annotated link|Argument}}\n* {{annotated link|Argumentation theory}}\n* {{annotated link|Critical thinking}}\n* {{annotated link|Digital electronics}} (also known as ''[[digital logic]]'' or [[logic gate]]s)\n* {{annotated link|Fallacies}}\n* {{annotated link|List of logicians}}\n* {{annotated link|List of logic journals}}\n* {{annotated link|List of logic symbols}}\n* {{annotated link|Logic puzzle}}\n* {{annotated link|Mathematics}}\n** {{annotated link|List of mathematics articles}}\n** {{annotated link|Outline of mathematics}}\n* {{annotated link|Metalogic}}\n* {{annotated link|Outline of logic}}\n* {{annotated link|Philosophy}}\n** {{annotated link|List of philosophy topics}}\n** {{annotated link|Outline of philosophy}}\n* {{annotated link|Logos}}\n* {{annotated link|Logical reasoning}}\n* {{annotated link|Reason}}\n* {{annotated link|Truth}}\n* {{annotated link|Vector logic}}\n}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"achievement\">E.g., Kline (1972, p. 53) wrote \"A major achievement of Aristotle was the founding of the science of logic\".</ref>\n<!--\n<ref name=\"Advances in Argumentation Theory and Research\">{{Cite book |title=Advances in Argumentation Theory and Research |publisher=[[Southern Illinois University Press]] |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-8093-1050-0 |editor-last=Cox |editor-first=J.

In the second part we have compared Frege's definition of number to the Navya-Nyaya definition of number. In the third part we have shown how the study of the so-called 'restrictive conditions for universals' in Navya-Nyaya logic anticipated some of the developments of modern set theory.}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"google\">Jonathan Lear (1986). \"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=lXI7AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA34&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Aristotle and Logical Theory]''\".

In 2004, he co-founded BlueLithium, which went on to become the fifth largest ad-network in USA, before being sold to Yahoo in a $300 million deal. Chahal has since founded other internet-based companies including [[RadiumOne]] and Gravity4. He is currently the CEO of RedLotus. \n\nIn 2010, [[Bloomberg Businessweek]] named him among the 15 best young entrepreneurs of the year. In 2012,  Chahal was enlisted among the 25 richest entrepreneurs under the age of 30 by [[Complex (magazine)|Complex magazine]]. In 2013, he was named as one of the [[Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award|entrepreneurs of the year]] by [[Ernst and Young]].\n\nIn 2013, Chahal was convicted for [[domestic violence]] and [[battery (crime)|battery]], and was sentenced to [[probation]]. He claimed innocence, but was terminated from his role as CEO of RadiumOne by the Board of Directors. In 2016, after new charges of domestic violence against a second woman with whom he was in a relationship, his probation was revoked.

The very first, possibly from the whole area, might have been Jan \"John\" Duban (1820-1897) and his family who moved to [[Madison County, Illinois|Illinois side]] of the [[St. Louis]] area around 1851. Afterwards, immigration increased with the foundation of [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] in 1857 through which a majority of the area's immigrants traveled by ship from [[Bremen]] to [[Baltimore]].\n\nJan was followed by the Tichacek family to St. Louis around 1858 and Jan \"John Adam\" Stupka (1825-1914) who settled in [[Monmouth, Iowa]] around 1859. Immigration slowed because of the [[American Civil War]] in which Duban served in the [[Union Army|Union army]]. This lasted until the later half of the 1860s.

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life. He died of a stroke visiting his brother in P\u00edsek in 1911.\n\n[[:cs:Ladislav Stehl\u00edk|Ladislav Stehl\u00edk (1908 - 1987)]] - poet, writer\n\nHe was born on 26 June 1908 in house number 36 in [[B\u011bl\u010dice]], lying between [[Blatn\u00e1]] and B\u0159eznice. It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi.

This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession. He taught gradually at three Sm\u00edchov schools until 1966, when he retired and continued to pursue literary work.\n\nIn 1968, on the anniversary of his 60th birthday, he was awarded the title of Merited Artist. He died on September 11, 1987 in Prague and at his request was buried in his native B\u011bl\u010dice. The grave of Ladislav Stehl\u00edk is decorated with a bust by sculptor B\u0159etislav Benda.\n\nBlanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 (1933) - historian\n\nArt historian, journalist PhDr. Blanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 Csc.

The very first, possibly from the whole area, might have been Jan \"John\" Duban (1820-1897) and his family who moved to [[Madison County, Illinois|Illinois side]] of the [[St. Louis]] area around 1851. Afterwards, immigration increased with the foundation of [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] in 1857 through which a majority of the area's immigrants traveled by ship from [[Bremen]] to [[Baltimore]].\n\nJan was followed by the Tichacek family to St. Louis around 1858 and Jan \"John Adam\" Stupka (1825-1914) who settled in [[Monmouth, Iowa]] around 1859. Immigration slowed because of the [[American Civil War]] in which Duban served in the [[Union Army|Union army]]. This lasted until the later half of the 1860s.

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life. He died of a stroke visiting his brother in P\u00edsek in 1911.\n\n[[:cs:Ladislav Stehl\u00edk|Ladislav Stehl\u00edk (1908 - 1987)]] - poet, writer\n\nHe was born on 26 June 1908 in house number 36 in [[B\u011bl\u010dice]], lying between [[Blatn\u00e1]] and B\u0159eznice. It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi. From May 1930 until the liberation in 1945, ie for fifteen years, he worked as a teacher in the village of \u0160umava at the elementary school in Mysl\u00edv, Klatovy.\n\nLadislav Stehl\u00edk's Mysl\u00edv stay inspired him to write six poetry collections. This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession. He taught gradually at three Sm\u00edchov schools until 1966, when he retired and continued to pursue literary work.\n\nIn 1968, on the anniversary of his 60th birthday, he was awarded the title of Merited Artist. He died on September 11, 1987 in Prague and at his request was buried in his native B\u011bl\u010dice. The grave of Ladislav Stehl\u00edk is decorated with a bust by sculptor B\u0159etislav Benda.\n\nBlanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 (1933) - historian\n\nArt historian, journalist PhDr. Blanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 Csc.

{"title_page": "Royal New Zealand Naval Volunteer Reserve", "text_new": "The '''Royal New Zealand Naval Volunteer Reserve''' (RNZNVR) is the volunteer reserve force of the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]] (RNZN).\n\n==History==\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2012}}\n\n===Early history===\n\nThe first Naval Volunteer units were formed in [[Auckland]] and Nelson in 1858. Over the rest of the 19th century Naval Volunteer units were formed in various ports such as Bluff, Wanganui, and Wairoa. These were reorganised into Naval Artillery Volunteers in 1883. \n\nThe Volunteers, or \"Navals\", peaked after the [[Coastal fortifications of New Zealand#The \"Russian-scare\" forts of 1885|Russian-scare]] in the 1880s with a total of 20 units. Volunteers were trained in boats, taught gunnery, and manned some of the [[Coastal fortifications of New Zealand#The forts|coastal batteries]] at the four main ports. Later they were also trained in mining submarines and maintaining minefields that were laid in Auckland and Wellington harbours.\n\nThe Naval Volunteers supplemented a small number of regular soldiers known as the Permanent Militia. The Permanent Militia included the New Zealand Torpedo Corps who were responsible for manning the four [[Defender class torpedo boat|''Defender''-class torpedo boats]] and the Submarine Mining Corps. \n\nIn 1902 the Volunteers were further reorganised into the Garrison Artillery Volunteers. In a special report in 1919, [[Admiral of the Fleet]] [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Lord Jellicoe]] recommended that New Zealand acquire 18 minesweepers.\n\n===Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve===\n\nThe next major reorganisation occurred in 1926 when the [[New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy|New Zealand Division]] of the [[Royal Navy]] was formed. A unit of the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] was established in Auckland and further units were opened in Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin two years later. \n \nThe Government finally responded to Jellicoe's report by purchasing one second-hand minesweeping trawler, [[HMNZS Wakakura (T00)|HMS ''Wakakura'']]. This was the sole training ship for the Naval Reserve until the beginning of World War II. ''Wakakura'' moved from port to port so each unit could have its share of sea training and live gunnery practice. \n\nBy 1939 the need to protect merchant ships from mines which might be laid round the coast was becoming increasingly apparent. There were, at that point, 78 officers and 610 ratings active in the New Zealand Division of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.\n\n===War years===\n\nThe declaration of War in 1939 saw the normal activity of the Naval Reserve suspended. Its personnel were called up for war service. Early in the war some Reserve personnel were drafted to duties as gunners on merchant ships or to serve on Royal Navy ships, or they embarked for further training in the United Kingdom. \n\nOn 1 October 1941 New Zealand Naval forces ceased to exist. King George VI consented to the formation of the Royal New Zealand Navy and the New Zealand navy was no longer a mere division of the Royal Navy. All ships and training bases were recommissioned into the new navy, and the prefix \"HMS\" to their names were replaced with \"HMNZS\".\n\nOf the 1700 Naval Reservists who trained prior to the outbreak of war, 139 lost their lives, 80 in the sinking of [[Cruisers of the Royal New Zealand Navy#Loss of HMS Neptune|HMS ''Neptune'']].\n\n===Becomes the RNZNVR===\n\nAt the end of war plans to reconstitute the Naval Reserve were put into operation. Officers were selected from those who had been demobilised and recruiting began in September 1948 with the intention of reaching a strength of 70 officers and 600 ratings. It would now be called the Royal New Zealand Naval Volunteer Reserve.\n\nIn 1947 the Government transferred a [[Coastal Forces of the Royal New Zealand Navy#RNZN Harbour Defence Launches|Harbour Defence Motor Launch]] to each unit. Naval Reservists also trained in Royal New Zealand Navy [[Cruisers of the Royal New Zealand Navy|cruisers]], [[Frigates of the Royal New Zealand Navy|frigates]] and [[Minesweepers of the Royal New Zealand Navy|minesweepers]] but the motor launches were now the mainstay of seamanship training. Training in general was focused, as in the regular force, on training Seamen, Gunners, Communicators, Radar Plotters, Electricians, Marine Engineers, Medical Assistants and Clerks.\n\nFrom 1978, as the ships of the regular force became more and more complex, Naval Reserve training focused on patrol craft seamanship and engineering, and on the protection of merchant shipping. Around 1984 the motor launches were upgraded to [[Patrol boats of the Royal New Zealand Navy#Moa class inshore patrol boats|''Moa'' class inshore patrol boats]] (IPVs).\n\nThe shift in focus stemmed from the understanding that military control of vital seaborne trade was imperative for New Zealand's survival. The basic principle of effectively managing and protecting seaborne trade remains a basic Naval Reserve task today.\n\n==Current status==\nThe current RNZNVR Mission is: \"To contribute to the Navy mission by providing competent Reserve personnel fit for service\". The Naval Volunteer Reserve are part-time people, the seagoing equivalent of Army [[New Zealand Army#Territorial Force|Territorials]]. Reservists are typically people with regular jobs, although many are also tertiary students or full-time parents, who get paid for the spare time they spend as a member of the Naval Reserve. They formerly crewed the [[Patrol boats of the Royal New Zealand Navy#Moa class inshore patrol boats|inshore patrol vessels]] and have opportunities to work with regular force either at sea, ashore or overseas on peacekeeping missions.<ref>[http://www.navy.mil.nz/naval-reserve/ Official navy website] Naval Reserve</ref> As of 1 July 2007 there were 237 people in the Naval Reserve.<ref>[http://www.nzdf.mil.nz/downloads/pdf/public-docs/2007/nzdf-annual-report-2007.pdf NZDF Annual Report 2006-2007], Page 40.

Over the rest of the 19th century Naval Volunteer units were formed in various ports such as Bluff, Wanganui, and Wairoa. These were reorganised into Naval Artillery Volunteers in 1883. \n\nThe Volunteers, or \"Navals\", peaked after the [[Coastal fortifications of New Zealand#The \"Russian-scare\" forts of 1885|Russian-scare]] in the 1880s with a total of 20 units. Volunteers were trained in boats, taught gunnery, and manned some of the [[Coastal fortifications of New Zealand#The forts|coastal batteries]] at the four main ports. Later they were also trained in mining submarines and maintaining minefields that were laid in Auckland and Wellington harbours.\n\nThe Naval Volunteers supplemented a small number of regular soldiers known as the Permanent Militia. The Permanent Militia included the New Zealand Torpedo Corps who were responsible for manning the four [[Defender class torpedo boat|''Defender''-class torpedo boats]] and the Submarine Mining Corps. \n\nIn 1902 the Volunteers were further reorganised into the Garrison Artillery Volunteers. In a special report in 1919, [[Admiral of the Fleet]] [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Lord Jellicoe]] recommended that New Zealand acquire 18 minesweepers.\n\n===Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve===\n\nThe next major reorganisation occurred in 1926 when the [[New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy|New Zealand Division]] of the [[Royal Navy]] was formed. A unit of the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] was established in Auckland and further units were opened in Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin two years later. \n \nThe Government finally responded to Jellicoe's report by purchasing one second-hand minesweeping trawler, [[HMNZS Wakakura (T00)|HMS ''Wakakura'']]. This was the sole training ship for the Naval Reserve until the beginning of World War II. ''Wakakura'' moved from port to port so each unit could have its share of sea training and live gunnery practice. \n\nBy 1939 the need to protect merchant ships from mines which might be laid round the coast was becoming increasingly apparent. There were, at that point, 78 officers and 610 ratings active in the New Zealand Division of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.\n\n===War years===\n\nThe declaration of War in 1939 saw the normal activity of the Naval Reserve suspended. Its personnel were called up for war service. Early in the war some Reserve personnel were drafted to duties as gunners on merchant ships or to serve on Royal Navy ships, or they embarked for further training in the United Kingdom. \n\nOn 1 October 1941 New Zealand Naval forces ceased to exist. King George VI consented to the formation of the Royal New Zealand Navy and the New Zealand navy was no longer a mere division of the Royal Navy. All ships and training bases were recommissioned into the new navy, and the prefix \"HMS\" to their names were replaced with \"HMNZS\".\n\nOf the 1700 Naval Reservists who trained prior to the outbreak of war, 139 lost their lives, 80 in the sinking of [[Cruisers of the Royal New Zealand Navy#Loss of HMS Neptune|HMS ''Neptune'']].\n\n===Becomes the RNZNVR===\n\nAt the end of war plans to reconstitute the Naval Reserve were put into operation. Officers were selected from those who had been demobilised and recruiting began in September 1948 with the intention of reaching a strength of 70 officers and 600 ratings. It would now be called the Royal New Zealand Naval Volunteer Reserve.\n\nIn 1947 the Government transferred a [[Coastal Forces of the Royal New Zealand Navy#RNZN Harbour Defence Launches|Harbour Defence Motor Launch]] to each unit. Naval Reservists also trained in Royal New Zealand Navy [[Cruisers of the Royal New Zealand Navy|cruisers]], [[Frigates of the Royal New Zealand Navy|frigates]] and [[Minesweepers of the Royal New Zealand Navy|minesweepers]] but the motor launches were now the mainstay of seamanship training. Training in general was focused, as in the regular force, on training Seamen, Gunners, Communicators, Radar Plotters, Electricians, Marine Engineers, Medical Assistants and Clerks.\n\nFrom 1978, as the ships of the regular force became more and more complex, Naval Reserve training focused on patrol craft seamanship and engineering, and on the protection of merchant shipping. Around 1984 the motor launches were upgraded to [[Patrol boats of the Royal New Zealand Navy#Moa class inshore patrol boats|''Moa'' class inshore patrol boats]] (IPVs).\n\nThe shift in focus stemmed from the understanding that military control of vital seaborne trade was imperative for New Zealand's survival. The basic principle of effectively managing and protecting seaborne trade remains a basic Naval Reserve task today.\n\n==Current status==\nThe current RNZNVR Mission is: \"To contribute to the Navy mission by providing competent Reserve personnel fit for service\". The Naval Volunteer Reserve are part-time people, the seagoing equivalent of Army [[New Zealand Army#Territorial Force|Territorials]]. Reservists are typically people with regular jobs, although many are also tertiary students or full-time parents, who get paid for the spare time they spend as a member of the Naval Reserve. They formerly crewed the [[Patrol boats of the Royal New Zealand Navy#Moa class inshore patrol boats|inshore patrol vessels]] and have opportunities to work with regular force either at sea, ashore or overseas on peacekeeping missions.<ref>[http://www.navy.mil.nz/naval-reserve/ Official navy website] Naval Reserve</ref> As of 1 July 2007 there were 237 people in the Naval Reserve.<ref>[http://www.nzdf.mil.nz/downloads/pdf/public-docs/2007/nzdf-annual-report-2007.pdf NZDF Annual Report 2006-2007], Page 40.

The girls go dancing at clubs and date young men they meet, but the down-to-earth Baba is more socially adept than shy, romantic Kate. On a ride to the countryside with one of Baba's boyfriends, the girls meet Eugene Gaillard, a sophisticated middle-aged author. Kate is attracted to him, and when she happens to see him again in a Dublin bookshop, uncharacteristically approaches him and strikes up a conversation.

Kate finally leaves Eugene and returns to Baba, who is packing to move to London and invites Kate to come along. Kate hopes that Eugene will come after her and ask her to return to him, but instead he sends word through Baba that their breakup is probably for the best.

After defeating Castella, players are presented with various scenes of the game along with the credits, and finally a group picture of the main characters.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n|title     = Contemporary reception\n|GR        = (Neo Geo) 55%<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamerankings.com/neo/582031-burning-fight/index.html|title=Burning Fight for NeoGeo|work=[[GameRankings]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=2019|accessdate=2019-07-21}}</ref>\n|Allgame   = (Neo Geo) {{Rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"AGNGbf\">{{cite web|last=Knight|first=Kyle|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=16994&tab=review|title=Burning Fight (Neo Geo Advanced Entertainment System) - Review|work=[[AllGame]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|date=1998|access-date=2019-07-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115224240/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=16994&tab=review|archive-date=2014-11-15|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|CVG       = (Neo Geo) 92 / 100<ref name=\"CVGNGbf\">{{cite magazine|last1=Rand|first1=Paul|last2=Boone|first2=Tim|url=https://archive.org/stream/computer-video-games-magazine-122/CVG122_Jan_1992#page/n33/mode/2up|title=Reviews - Neo Geo -- Burning Fight|magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]|issue=122|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|date=January 1992|pages=34\u201335}}</ref>\n|GamePro   = (Neo Geo) 24 / 25<ref name=\"GProNGbf\">{{cite magazine|last=Quan|first=Slasher|url=https://archive.org/details/GamePro_Issue_030_January_1992/page/n103|title=Neo Geo For Real! - Burning Fight|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=30|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1992|pages=101\u2013102}}</ref>\n|rev1      = ''[[:fr:Consoles +|Consoles +]]''\n|rev1Score = (Neo Geo) 92%<ref name=\"C+NGbf\">{{cite magazine|author1=Loulou|author2=El Nio Nio|url=https://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=51&num=8895&album=oui|title=Neo Geo Review - Burning Fight|magazine=[[:fr:Consoles +|Consoles +]]|issue=5|publisher=[[:fr:M.E.R.7|M.E.R.7]]|date=January 1992|pages=34\u201335|lang=fr}}</ref>\n|rev2      = ''[[Hobby Consolas|Hobby Hi-Tech]]''\n|rev2Score = (Neo Geo CD) 4 / 10<ref name=\"HHiTechNGCDbf\">{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/stream/HiTechMagazine/HiTech%2001#page/n28/mode/1up|title=Reportaje - Cl\u00e1sicos en CD -- Titulos disponibles para el nuevo formato de SNK: Burning Fight|magazine=[[Hobby Consolas|Hobby Hi-Tech]]|issue=1|publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]]|date=March 1995|page=29|lang=es}}</ref>\n|rev3      = ''[[:fr:Joypad (magazine)|Joypad]]''\n|rev3Score = (Neo Geo) 92%<ref name=\"JpadNGbf\">{{cite magazine|author1=Steph|last2=Demoly|first2=Jean-Marc|url=https://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=84&num=1771&album=oui|title=Test - Neo Geo - Burning Fight|magazine=[[:fr:Joypad (magazine)|Joypad]]|issue=2|publisher=[[:fr:Yellow Media|Yellow Media]]|date=November 1991|pages=122\u2013124|lang=fr}}</ref>\n|rev4      = ''[[:fr:Joystick (magazine)|Joystick]]''\n|rev4Score = (Neo Geo) 92%<ref name=\"JNGbf\">{{cite magazine|last=Demoly|first=Jean-Marc|url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Joystick/joystick_numero020/Joystick%20020%20-%20Page%20131%20(1991-10).jpg|title=Tests - Neo Geo - Burning Fight|magazine=[[:fr:Joystick (magazine)|Joystick]]|issue=20|publisher=[[:fr:Anuman Interactive|Anuman Interactive]]|date=October 1991|page=131|lang=fr|access-date=2019-07-21}}</ref>\n|rev5      = ''[[:de:Mega Fun|Mega Fun]]''\n|rev5Score = (Neo Geo) 77%<ref name=\"MFNGbf\">{{cite magazine|last1=Noak|first1=Philipp|last2=Hellert|first2=Stefan|url=http://www.kultboy.com/index.php?site=t&id=8807&s=3|title=Special - Neo Geo - Burning Fight|magazine=[[:de:Mega Fun|Mega Fun]]|issue=11|publisher=[[:de:Computec Media Group|CT Computec Verlag GmbH & Co.

The professional relationship between the two men soon grew into a great friendship, fuelled in particular by a shared love of cars, aeronautics and mechanics. Then they decided to go into partnership together in order to enhance and launch their plans for a new watch brand with the support of Lucien Tissot, a lawyer specialised in the watchmaking industry.\n\nIn early 1999, Richard Mille and Dominique Guenat drew up their plans and the basis for the Richard Mille brand, in partnership with Guenat S.A.

Over the next two years, they defined their brand concept, combining the worlds of cars, aeronautics and sailing with the high-tech aspects of innovation, resistant materials and accuracy. After this, they began designing the future Richard Mille watches and subjected them to reliability and precision testing.

It specialises in transfers and the decoration of watch movement components ([[Electrotyping|galvanoplasty]], [[electroplating]], etc.).<ref name=VMDH/> VMDH produces all the dials and flanges used by the Richard Mille brand as well as some of the hands, and is tasked with applying \u00abSuper-LumiNova\u00bb [[phosphorescent]] pigments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Richard Mille: The art of manufacture-made calibers|url=https://www.gmtmag.com/en/nouveaute-en-n-en/focus-2/richard-mille-the-art-of-manufacture-made-calibers.html|work=Great Magazine of Timepieces|publisher=Brice Lechevalier|date=31 August 2017}}</ref> VMDH is chaired by Yves Mathys.\n\n== The Richard Mille brand ==\n=== Visual identity ===\n[[Image:RM 030 Automatic.jpg|thumb|RM 030 with the characteristic Richard Mille case shape]]\nThe characteristic Richard Mille case shape is now the principal element of the brand's visual identity, ensuring that the watches are clearly recognisable, as are the ''spline screws'' visible on both the case and the inside of the movement.<ref name=Revolution>{{cite web|title=The RM 006: Richard Mille\u2019s First Race Machine on the Wrist|url=https://www.revolution.watch/rm-006-richard-milles-first-race-machine-wrist/|work=Revolution |publisher=Andrew Hildreth|date=27 June 2018}}</ref> The [[Movement (clockwork)|movement]] is always visible in a Richard Mille watch.\n\n===Products===\nThe brand's most famous models are the Tourbillon RM 008 ([[chronograph]] [[tourbillon]]) and the sapphire split seconds (chronograph tourbillon) RM 056. The RM 008 combines a tourbillon movement with manual winding, a chronograph split-seconds, a torque indicator, and a power reserve indicator. Claimed to be one of the most advanced watches in the world, it is priced from \u20ac500,000.\n\nThe RM 056 split seconds (chronograph tourbillon) is distinguished by its three-part all-sapphire skeletal case. The RM 056 is completely see-through and is the first watch case to be completely built from sapphire, with a limited edition five pieces of the Richard Mille RM 056 [[Felipe Massa]] Sapphire priced at US$1.7 million. The RM 056 was declared best watch of 2012 at the Salon Internacional de Alta Relojer\u00eda watchmakers' exhibition in [[Mexico City]] in October 2012.\n\n==Technologies==\nA large portion of Richard Mille's inspiration comes from racing cars and the study of shock-resistance, the concrete applications of which have made it possible to improve the rigidity of the baseplate, reduce friction, and give the watches very high shock-resistance. The concepts and materials inspired by Formula 1, which provided the basis for the first Richard Mille watch (RM 001), are one of the cornerstones of the brand's philosophy.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nRichard Mille decided to craft extremely lightweight and accurate watches from the best high-tech materials used in aeronautics, Formula 1<ref name=Revolution/> and precision surgery, such as grade 5 titanium, LITAL, Carbon TPT and graphene.

commercial strategy at Mauboussin, where he was a shareholder, Richard Mille left his position as General Manager of the watchmaking division of the [[Place Vend\u00f4me]] jeweller and decided to launch his own range of watches. In late 1998, he presented his plans to his friend Dominique Guenat, owner of \u00abMontres Valgine\u00bb (Guenat SA - Montres Valgine),<ref>{{cite web|title=Richard Mille\u2019s production quartet|url=https://journal.hautehorlogerie.org/en/richard-milles-production-quartet/|work=Autoplus |publisher=FHH Journal|date=19 June 2018}}</ref> whom he met in 1988 while working in [[Besan\u00e7on]] for Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Horlog\u00e8re (CGH) and with whom he worked on watches for Mauboussin. The professional relationship between the two men soon grew into a great friendship, fuelled in particular by a shared love of cars, aeronautics and mechanics. Then they decided to go into partnership together in order to enhance and launch their plans for a new watch brand with the support of Lucien Tissot, a lawyer specialised in the watchmaking industry.\n\nIn early 1999, Richard Mille and Dominique Guenat drew up their plans and the basis for the Richard Mille brand, in partnership with Guenat S.A.

Over the next two years, they defined their brand concept, combining the worlds of cars, aeronautics and sailing with the high-tech aspects of innovation, resistant materials and accuracy. After this, they began designing the future Richard Mille watches and subjected them to reliability and precision testing. Dominique Guenat and Richard Mille then founded Horom\u00e9trie SA \u2013 their operating company for the new Richard Mille brand \u2013 as equal partners, registered on {{date|23 October 2001}} in the Swiss registry of commerce (wholesale of watch and jewellery items).<ref>{{cite web|title=Horom\u00e9trie SA|url=https://www.easymonitoring.ch/fr/registre-du-commerce/horometrie-sa-655493|work=easyMonitoring}}</ref> They then founded the Richard Mille watchmaking brand in collaboration with Swiss watchmaking Manufacture [[Audemars Piguet]], which became a Richard Mille shareholder in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=Entr\u00e9e dans le capital de Richard Mille|url=http://fr.worldtempus.com/article/audemars-piguet-entree-dans-le-capital-de-richard-mille-2515.html|work=WorldTempus|publisher=Michel Jeannot|date=29 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter three years of research and prototypes, the Richard Mille brand presented its first watch, the RM 001 [[Tourbillon]] at [[Baselworld]] in 2001, the world watch and jewellery show held in [[Basel]], Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview : Richard Mille|url=http://forumamontres.forumactif.com/t19630-interview-de-richard-mille|work=Forum \u00e0 montres|accessdate=10 March 2014}}</ref> This manually wound mechanism was fitted with a ribbed tonneau-shaped case that revealed the mechanism6, the main features of the brand's visual identity, and included a tourbillon calibre, a power-reserve indicator and a torque indicator.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Watch that Changed the World: Richard Mille RM 001 Tourbillon |url=https://www.revolution.watch/watch-changed-world-richard-mille-rm-001-tourbillon/|work=Revolution|publisher=Wei Koh|date=28 February 2018}}</ref> The strap was made from leather and the crystal from mineral glass, and it had a water-resistance of up to 50 metres.\n\nThen, in 2002, Richard Mille presented the RM 002, a technological development on the first model and the first watch in the history of watchmaking to feature a titanium baseplate. This was followed later that year by the RM 003, a dual time zone tourbillon, and by the RM 004 flyback chronograph in 2003.\n\nIn 2005, the watch brand launched the RM 007, the first ladies' watch in the Richard Mille collection.\n\nRichard Mille soon made a name for itself in the luxury and ultra-luxury watch sectors thanks to its innovative materials and technology, joining the Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=Richard Mille : History|url=https://www.hautehorlogerie.org/en/brands/history/h/richard-mille/|work=FHH}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2013, Richard Mille and Dominique Guenat acquired a 90% stake in''Prototypes Artisanals SA'' (with former director Alain Varrin retaining a 10% share).<ref name=ProArt>{{cite web|title=Un sous-traitant exclusif|url=https://www.msm.ch/un-sous-traitant-exclusif-a-463760/|work=MSM|publisher=Jean-Ren\u00e9 Gonthier|date=21 October 2014}}</ref> Founded by Marco Poluzzi, the company became \u00abProArt\u00bb and moved to a 3,000 m\u00b2 building in Les Breuleux built for the production of watch cases and prototypes.

The RM 056 is completely see-through and is the first watch case to be completely built from sapphire, with a limited edition five pieces of the Richard Mille RM 056 [[Felipe Massa]] Sapphire priced at US$1.7 million. The RM 056 was declared best watch of 2012 at the Salon Internacional de Alta Relojer\u00eda watchmakers' exhibition in [[Mexico City]] in October 2012.\n\n==Technologies==\nA large portion of Richard Mille's inspiration comes from racing cars and the study of shock-resistance, the concrete applications of which have made it possible to improve the rigidity of the baseplate, reduce friction, and give the watches very high shock-resistance. The concepts and materials inspired by Formula 1, which provided the basis for the first Richard Mille watch (RM 001), are one of the cornerstones of the brand's philosophy.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nRichard Mille decided to craft extremely lightweight and accurate watches from the best high-tech materials used in aeronautics, Formula 1<ref name=Revolution/> and precision surgery, such as grade 5 titanium, LITAL, Carbon TPT and graphene.

Generally a [[sensory receptor]] receives an environmental stimulus, in this case from objects reaching nerves in the back of the throat, and sends a message via an [[afferent nerve]] to the [[central nervous system]] (CNS). The CNS receives this message and sends an appropriate response via an [[efferent nerve]] (also known as a [[motor neuron]]) to effector cells located in the same initial area that can then carry out the appropriate response.<ref name=\"Sword Swallowing\">{{Cite web |last=Wilson |first=Tracy V. |title=How Sword Swallowing Works |date=29 June 2007 |work=[[HowStuffWorks]] |url=http://www.howstuffworks.com/arts/circus-arts/sword-swallowing.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn the case of the pharyngeal reflex: \n*the sensory limb is mediated predominantly by CN IX (glossopharyngeal nerve)\n*the motor limb by CN X (vagus nerve).\n\nThe gag reflex involves a brisk and brief elevation of the soft palate and bilateral contraction of pharyngeal muscles evoked by touching the posterior pharyngeal wall. Touching the soft palate can lead to a similar reflex response. However, in that case, the sensory limb of the reflex is the CN V (trigeminal nerve). In very sensitive individuals, much more of the brain stem may be involved; a simple gag may enlarge to retching and vomiting in some.\n\n==Suppression and activation==\nSwallowing unusually large objects or placing objects in the back of the mouth may cause the pharyngeal reflex. Some people, for instance [[Sword swallowing|sword swallower]]s, have learned how to suppress it.<ref name=\"Sword Swallowing\" /> In contrast, triggering the reflex is sometimes done intentionally to induce vomiting, by those who suffer from [[bulimia nervosa]].\n\nAccording to one study, one in three people lacks a gag reflex.<ref name=\"Pharyngeal sensation\" /> However, on the other end of the spectrum are people with a hypersensitive gag reflex. This hypersensitivity can lead to issues in various situations, from swallowing a pill or large bites of food to visiting the dentist. Hypersensitivity is generally a conditioned response, usually occurring following a previous experience. There are a variety of ways to desensitize one's hypersensitivity, from relaxation to numbing the mouth and throat to training one's soft palate to get used to being touched.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n[[Acupuncture]] at the acupoint P6 is thought to reduce a person's gag reflex.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eachempati|first=Prashanti|last2=Kumbargere Nagraj|first2=Sumanth|last3=Kiran Kumar Krishanappa|first3=Salian|last4=George|first4=Renjith P|last5=Soe|first5=Htoo Htoo Kyaw|last6=Karanth|first6=Laxminarayan|date=2019-11-13|editor-last=Cochrane Oral Health Group|title=Management of gag reflex for patients undergoing dental treatment|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/14651858.CD011116.pub3|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011116.pub3|pmc=PMC6953338|pmid=31721146}}</ref>\n\n==Absence==\nIn certain cases, absence of the gag reflex and pharyngeal sensation can be a symptom of a number of severe medical conditions, such as damage to the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]], the [[vagus nerve]], or [[brain death]].\n\nIn unilateral (one-sided) glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX- sensory component) damage, there will be no gag response when touching the pharyngeal wall on the same side of the damaged nerve.\nWith one-sided vagal nerve (CN X- motor component) damage, the soft palate will elevate and pull toward the intact side regardless of the side of the pharynx that is touched. This is because the sensory component is intact on both sides, but only the motor nerves supplying one side of the soft palatine and pharyngeal muscles is working, therefore the contraction of the muscles in the reflex is asymmetrical. \nIf both CN IX and X are damaged on one side (not uncommon), stimulation of the normal side elicits only a unilateral response, with deviation of the soft palate to that side; no consensual response is seen. Touching the damaged side produces no response at all.\n\nAt one point, it was thought that a lack of the gag reflex in stroke patients was a good predictor for dysphagia (difficulty with swallowing) or laryngeal aspiration (food or drink entering the [[larynx]]), and was therefore commonly checked for. However, in one study, 37% of healthy people did not have a gag reflex, yet all subjects except for one still retained an intact pharyngeal sensation. These results suggest that the muscles that control the gag reflex remain independent of those that control normal swallowing. Since this reflex is commonly not found in healthy people, its predictive value in determining the risk for swallowing disorders is severely limited. Pharyngeal sensation, on the other hand, as seen by this study, is rarely absent, and could prove better at predicting future problems with swallowing.<ref name=\"Pharyngeal sensation\">{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Davies | first1 = A.

This reflex in particular functions as a protective system for the upper respiratory tract as it not only forces the glottis to close, thereby preventing any substances getting into the airways, but also clears the pharynx of any residual substances by a swallow.\n\nThis particular reflex is simply one of several aero digestive reflexes, including also the pharyngoglottal closure reflex (in which no swallowing occurs yet the [[glottis]] still closes) and the pharyngo-upper esophageal sphincter contractile reflex, which occurs mainly during gastroesophageal reflux episodes. All either forcibly close the glottis or allow the pharynx to remove particles into the digestive tract that may have been forced back up by both this tract and the upper respiratory tract. These reflexes can also protect the airways from any food or liquids that may spill over from the hypopharynx. The hypopharynx is the bottom part of pharynx, and can be considered the first area where the digestive tract splits from the airways. However, if the maximum capacity of fluids that the hypopharynx can safely hold is exceeded, then this excess fluid spills into the [[larynx]] and from there into the lungs. Therefore, these reflexes prevent levels reaching this maximum volume.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dua|first=Kulwinder|author2=Sri Naveen Surapaneni |author3=Shiko Kuribayashi |author4=Muhammed Hafeezullah |author5=Reza Shaker |title=Pharyngeal airway protective reflexes are triggered before the maximum volume of fluid that the hypopharynx can safely hold is exceeded|journal=Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol|date=May 2011|volume=301|issue=2|pages=G197-202|doi=10.1152/ajpgi.00046.2011|pmid=21566013|pmc=3154610}}</ref>\n\nSince both the digestive system and the respiratory system are connected by the pharynx, there are many problems and diseases that occur when the body is unable to regulate passage of food and air into the appropriate tracts. Perhaps the most preventable cause of damage to these reflexes originates from smoking. One study has shown that, when compared to non-smokers, the threshold volumes (in other words the lowest volume at which one of these reflexes is triggered) for both the pharyngo-upper esophageal sphincter contractile reflex and reflexive pharyngeal swallowing is increased.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dua|first=K|author2=E Bardan |author3=J Ren |author4=Z Sui |author5=R Shaker |title=Effect of chronic and acute cigarette smoking on the pharyngo-upper oesophageal sphincter contractile reflex and reflexive pharyngeal swallow|journal=Gut|year=1998|volume=43|pages=537\u2013541|pmc=1727281|pmid=9824582|issue=4|doi=10.1136/gut.43.4.537}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Retching]], also known as dry heaving\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Reflex}}\n\n[[Category:Human throat]]\n[[Category:Reflexes]]\n[[Category:Vomiting]]\n", "text_old": "The '''pharyngeal reflex''', '''gag reflex''', or '''laryngeal spasm''', is a [[reflex]] contraction of the back of the throat,<ref name=\"urlMedical Neurosciences\">{{cite web |url=http://www.neuroanatomy.wisc.edu/virtualbrain/BrainStem/09NA.html |title=Medical Neurosciences |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306024508/http://www.neuroanatomy.wisc.edu/virtualbrain/BrainStem/09NA.html |archivedate=2012-03-06 }}</ref> evoked by touching the roof of the [[mouth]], the back of the [[tongue]], the area around the [[tonsils]], the [[palatine uvula|uvula]], and the back of the [[throat]].

However, if the maximum capacity of fluids that the hypopharynx can safely hold is exceeded, then this excess fluid spills into the [[larynx]] and from there into the lungs. Therefore, these reflexes prevent levels reaching this maximum volume.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dua|first=Kulwinder|author2=Sri Naveen Surapaneni |author3=Shiko Kuribayashi |author4=Muhammed Hafeezullah |author5=Reza Shaker |title=Pharyngeal airway protective reflexes are triggered before the maximum volume of fluid that the hypopharynx can safely hold is exceeded|journal=Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol|date=May 2011|volume=301|issue=2|pages=G197-202|doi=10.1152/ajpgi.00046.2011|pmid=21566013|pmc=3154610}}</ref>\n\nSince both the digestive system and the respiratory system are connected by the pharynx, there are many problems and diseases that occur when the body is unable to regulate passage of food and air into the appropriate tracts. Perhaps the most preventable cause of damage to these reflexes originates from smoking. One study has shown that, when compared to non-smokers, the threshold volumes (in other words the lowest volume at which one of these reflexes is triggered) for both the pharyngo-upper esophageal sphincter contractile reflex and reflexive pharyngeal swallowing is increased.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dua|first=K|author2=E Bardan |author3=J Ren |author4=Z Sui |author5=R Shaker |title=Effect of chronic and acute cigarette smoking on the pharyngo-upper oesophageal sphincter contractile reflex and reflexive pharyngeal swallow|journal=Gut|year=1998|volume=43|pages=537\u2013541|pmc=1727281|pmid=9824582|issue=4|doi=10.1136/gut.43.4.537}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Retching]], also known as dry heaving\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Reflex}}\n\n[[Category:Human throat]]\n[[Category:Reflexes]]\n[[Category:Vomiting]]\n", "name_user": "Greyjoy", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSuppression and activation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharyngeal_reflex"}

Since the closure of [[Leuchars Station|RAF Leuchars]] in 2015, Lossiemouth is the only operational RAF station in Scotland and is one of two main operating bases for the [[Eurofighter Typhoon|Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4]] in the United Kingdom. It is home to four front-line units which operate the Typhoon ([[No. 1 Squadron RAF|No. 1 Squadron]], [[No. 2 Squadron RAF|No. 2 (AC) Squadron]], [[No. 6 Squadron RAF|No. 6 Squadron]] and [[No. 9 Squadron RAF|No. 9 Squadron]]) each of which contribute to the [[Quick Reaction Alert|Quick Reaction Alert (Interceptor) North]] capability which provides continuous protection of UK airspace.\n\nThe airfield opened in 1939 and was operated by the RAF, predominantly as part of [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]], until 1946 when it transferred to the [[Fleet Air Arm]] (FAA) and became known as '''RNAS Lossiemouth''' or '''HMS ''Fulmar'''''. Lossiemouth was used as a training station by the FAA until it was handed back to the RAF in September 1972, after which it has largely operated as a fast-jet base.\n\nInvestment in infrastructure is planned at Lossiemouth in order to accommodate the RAF's new fleet of [[Boeing P-8 Poseidon|Boeing Poseidon MRA1]] aircraft, which are expected to enter service in 2020. No. 120 Squadron reformed in early 2018 and will be the first to equip with the aircraft.\n\n==History==\n=== Construction (1938\u20131939) ===\nConstruction started during the summer of 1938, when {{convert|220|ha|acre|abbr=off}} of agricultural land was acquired in order to accommodate the airfield. The land was cleared of vegetation and buildings and by the spring of 1939 several wooden huts were present. [[Group captain|Group Captain]] P.E Maitland was the first station commander and took up post in March 1939, with the station formally opening on 1 May 1939.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|pp=4\u20136}}  The first unit to take up residence at Lossiemouth was [[No. 15 Flying Training School RAF]] (15 FTS), initially equipped with thirteen [[Airspeed Oxford]]s and five [[Hawker Hart]]s.{{sfn|Smith|1983|p=142}} Aircraft were stored in the open until the first hangars were completed in August 1939. That same month tragedy struck when three crew members were killed during a mid-air collision between two Oxfords.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=6}}\n\n===Second World War (1939\u20131945)===\nAt the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], a detachment of [[Seaforth Highlanders]] was sent to Lossiemouth to guard the station, and anti-aircraft defences were installed. Flying activity increased, with 15 FTS receiving more Oxfords and Harts and the introduction of the [[North American Harvard]]; eleven [[Fairey Battle]]s were also delivered for storage. The first front-line aircraft to operate from Lossiemouth were a detachment of twelve [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers belonging to [[No. 99 Squadron RAF|No. 99 Squadron]], arriving in November 1939 to take part in attack missions targeting the German [[cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Deutschland||2}}, which was operating between Iceland and the [[Shetland|Shetland Isles]].{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=6}} January 1940 saw detachments of [[Handley Page Hampden]]s from [[No. 44 Squadron RAF|No. 44 Squadron]] and [[No. 50 Squadron RAF|No. 50 Squadron]] arrive to take part in offensive patrols over the North Sea. However, the operation was short-lived as a result of bad weather, with the aircraft returning to their home base in mid-February.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=6}}\n\n[[File:Vickers-wellington-bomber-01.png|left|thumb|Vickers Wellington bombers of No. 9 Squadron.]]\nA detachment of [[No. 9 Squadron RAF|No. 9 Squadron]] spent a short period of time operating Wellingtons during April 1940, before being replaced by [[No. 107 Squadron RAF|No. 107 Squadron]] and [[No. 110 Squadron RAF|No. 110 Squadron]], which were equipped with [[Bristol Blenheim]]s. During this period the first loss to enemy action of an aircraft operating from Lossiemouth occurred when three Blenheims were shot down over Norway.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|pp=6\u20137}}\n\nIt soon became apparent that the frequent detachments of bomber aircraft were disrupting the training programme at Lossiemouth, and therefore, due to the strategic importance of the station as a base for bomber aircraft, it was decided to relocate 15 FTS to [[RAF Middle Wallop]] in Hampshire. On 27 April 1940, after the unit's departure, Lossiemouth transferred to [[No. 6 Group RAF|No. 6 Group]] of [[RAF Bomber Command]] and [[No. 20 Operational Training Unit]] (20 OTU) was established, initially operating Wellingtons and [[Avro Anson]]s.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=7}}\n\nNo. 46 Maintenance Unit (46 MU) was also formed in April 1940. 46 MU's role was to modify and fit out new aircraft before they were forwarded to front-line squadrons. A variety of aircraft were serviced, including [[Hawker Hurricane]]s, [[de Havilland Tiger Moth]]s, [[Hawker Audax]]es, and a [[de Havilland Hornet Moth]]. The unit primarily used six [[Robin hangar|Robin]] and eight [[Super Robin hangar]]s; however, due to a shortage of space, many aircraft were stored in fields outside the station.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=7}} Lossiemouth's first satellite airfield, located at Bogs of Mayne {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the south and known as [[RAF Elgin]], opened in June 1940.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p = 7}}\n\nOne officer and two aircrew were killed on 26 October 1940 when RAF Lossiemouth was attacked by the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' for the first time. The attack by three [[Heinkel He 111]]s resulted in the destruction of two Blenheims and damage to two [[Miles Magister]]s, two Tiger Moths and a Hurricane.

Operational sorties were predominately undertaken by Blenheims of [[No. 21 Squadron RAF|No. 21 Squadron]], [[No. 82 Squadron RAF|No. 82 Squadron]], No. 110 Squadron and [[No. 114 Squadron RAF|No. 114 Squadron]]. By the winter of 1941 the airfield had become so muddy that the Wellingtons of 20 OTU were temporarily relocated to [[RAF Lakenheath]] in Suffolk.{{sfn|Hughes|1999|p=111}} The increased activity by 46 MU resulted in two [[List of Royal Air Force Satellite Landing Grounds|satellite landing grounds (SLG)]] being established to store aircraft off-site. These were at [[RAF Black Isle]] (42 SLG) where [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s were kept and [[RAF Leanach]] (43 SLG) near [[Culloden, Highland|Culloden]], where Hurricanes and [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s were stored.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=9}}\n\nLossiemouth was used during 1942 as a base to launch [[List of Allied attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz|several unsuccessful missions]] to sink the German [[battleship]] {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}}, which at the time was operating in Norwegian [[fjord]]s. The first missions were undertaken in January 1942 by a detachment of thirteen [[Short Stirling]]s of [[No. 15 Squadron RAF|No. 15 Squadron]] and [[No. 149 Squadron RAF|No. 149 Squadron]] and thirteen [[Handley Page Halifax]]es of [[No. 10 Squadron RAF|No. 10 Squadron]] and [[No. 76 Squadron RAF|No. 76 Squadron]]. Further attempts were made during March by [[Avro Lancaster]]s of No. 44 Squadron and Halifaxes of No. 10 Squadron. Lancasters of No. 9 Squadron later joined the operation.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=10}} 1942 also saw numerous accidents involving 20 OTU aircraft, many of which resulted in death and serious injuries. These accidents were attributed to a combination of fatigued aircraft, inexperienced crews and poor weather.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=10}} Wellingtons of 20 OTU were also involved in [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing raids]] on German cities throughout 1942, the training aircraft being required to help reach the target number of 1000 bombers per raid.{{sfn|Hughes|1999|p=112}} The airfield's first surfaced runways, (06/24 {{convert|1828|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}; 09/27 {{convert|1371|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}; 01/19 {{convert|1280|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}), were constructed by an [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|engineering battalion]] of the [[United States Army Air Forces|US Army Air Force]] in late 1942 and helped to reduce interruptions to flying as a result of the grass strips being affected by poor weather. A new control tower was also constructed.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=10}}\n\nIn September 1943, Wellingtons of 'C' Flight 20 OTU, moved to the second of the Lossiemouth satellite airfields, [[RAF Milltown]], located {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the south-east. By now 46 MU were concentrating their work on Bristol Beaufighters and Lancasters and the SLG at RAF Leanach had been replaced with a new site at [[Dornoch]] golf course, which became known as [[RAF Dornoch]] (40 SLG).{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=11}} 20 OTU received its official crest in 1943, with two examples cast in concrete being constructed at Lossiemouth and RAF Elgin.

Since the closure of [[Leuchars Station|RAF Leuchars]] in 2015, Lossiemouth is the only operational RAF station in Scotland and is one of two main operating bases for the [[Eurofighter Typhoon|Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4]] in the United Kingdom. It is home to four front-line units which operate the Typhoon ([[No. 1 Squadron RAF|No. 1 Squadron]], [[No. 2 Squadron RAF|No. 2 (AC) Squadron]], [[No. 6 Squadron RAF|No. 6 Squadron]] and [[No. 9 Squadron RAF|No. 9 Squadron]]) each of which contribute to the [[Quick Reaction Alert|Quick Reaction Alert (Interceptor) North]] capability which provides continuous protection of UK airspace.\n\nThe airfield opened in 1939 and was operated by the RAF, predominantly as part of [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]], until 1946 when it transferred to the [[Fleet Air Arm]] (FAA) and became known as '''RNAS Lossiemouth''' or '''HMS ''Fulmar'''''. Lossiemouth was used as a training station by the FAA until it was handed back to the RAF in September 1972, after which it has largely operated as a fast-jet base.\n\nInvestment in infrastructure is planned at Lossiemouth in order to accommodate the RAF's new fleet of [[Boeing P-8 Poseidon|Boeing Poseidon MRA1]] aircraft, which are expected to enter service in 2020. No. 120 Squadron reformed in early 2018 and will be the first to equip with the aircraft.\n\n==History==\n=== Construction (1938\u20131939) ===\nConstruction started during the summer of 1938, when {{convert|220|ha|acre|abbr=off}} of agricultural land was acquired in order to accommodate the airfield. The land was cleared of vegetation and buildings and by the spring of 1939 several wooden huts were present. [[Group captain|Group Captain]] P.E Maitland was the first station commander and took up post in March 1939, with the station formally opening on 1 May 1939.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|pp=4\u20136}}  The first unit to take up residence at Lossiemouth was [[No. 15 Flying Training School RAF]] (15 FTS), initially equipped with thirteen [[Airspeed Oxford]]s and five [[Hawker Hart]]s.{{sfn|Smith|1983|p=142}} Aircraft were stored in the open until the first hangars were completed in August 1939. That same month tragedy struck when three crew members were killed during a mid-air collision between two Oxfords.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=6}}\n\n===Second World War (1939\u20131945)===\nAt the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], a detachment of [[Seaforth Highlanders]] was sent to Lossiemouth to guard the station, and anti-aircraft defences were installed. Flying activity increased, with 15 FTS receiving more Oxfords and Harts and the introduction of the [[North American Harvard]]; eleven [[Fairey Battle]]s were also delivered for storage. The first front-line aircraft to operate from Lossiemouth were a detachment of twelve [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers belonging to [[No. 99 Squadron RAF|No. 99 Squadron]], arriving in November 1939 to take part in attack missions targeting the German [[cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Deutschland||2}}, which was operating between Iceland and the [[Shetland|Shetland Isles]].{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=6}} January 1940 saw detachments of [[Handley Page Hampden]]s from [[No. 44 Squadron RAF|No. 44 Squadron]] and [[No. 50 Squadron RAF|No. 50 Squadron]] arrive to take part in offensive patrols over the North Sea. However, the operation was short-lived as a result of bad weather, with the aircraft returning to their home base in mid-February.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=6}}\n\n[[File:Vickers-wellington-bomber-01.png|left|thumb|Vickers Wellington bombers of No. 9 Squadron.]]\nA detachment of [[No. 9 Squadron RAF|No. 9 Squadron]] spent a short period of time operating Wellingtons during April 1940, before being replaced by [[No. 107 Squadron RAF|No. 107 Squadron]] and [[No. 110 Squadron RAF|No. 110 Squadron]], which were equipped with [[Bristol Blenheim]]s. During this period the first loss to enemy action of an aircraft operating from Lossiemouth occurred when three Blenheims were shot down over Norway.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|pp=6\u20137}}\n\nIt soon became apparent that the frequent detachments of bomber aircraft were disrupting the training programme at Lossiemouth, and therefore, due to the strategic importance of the station as a base for bomber aircraft, it was decided to relocate 15 FTS to [[RAF Middle Wallop]] in Hampshire. On 27 April 1940, after the unit's departure, Lossiemouth transferred to [[No. 6 Group RAF|No. 6 Group]] of [[RAF Bomber Command]] and [[No. 20 Operational Training Unit]] (20 OTU) was established, initially operating Wellingtons and [[Avro Anson]]s.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=7}}\n\nNo. 46 Maintenance Unit (46 MU) was also formed in April 1940. 46 MU's role was to modify and fit out new aircraft before they were forwarded to front-line squadrons. A variety of aircraft were serviced, including [[Hawker Hurricane]]s, [[de Havilland Tiger Moth]]s, [[Hawker Audax]]es, and a [[de Havilland Hornet Moth]]. The unit primarily used six [[Robin hangar|Robin]] and eight [[Super Robin hangar]]s; however, due to a shortage of space, many aircraft were stored in fields outside the station.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p=7}} Lossiemouth's first satellite airfield, located at Bogs of Mayne {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the south and known as [[RAF Elgin]], opened in June 1940.{{sfn|Hughes|1993|p = 7}}\n\nOne officer and two aircrew were killed on 26 October 1940 when RAF Lossiemouth was attacked by the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' for the first time.

The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.<ref name=\"nippon1\" />\n\nSecond, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease. Government officials revised the previous policy after acknowledging that such specialized institutions would be overwhelmed during a large cluster.\n\nThird, the policy asks those with any cold symptoms to take time off from work and avoid leaving their homes. Government officials urged companies to let employees work from home and commute at off-peak hours. The Japanese government also made an official request to local governments and businesses to cancel large-scale events.\n\nOn 27 February, PM Abe requested the closures of all schools from 2 March to the end of spring vacations, which usually conclude in early April. The next day, the Japanese government announced plans to create a fund to help companies subsidize workers who need to take days off to look after their children while schools are closed.<ref>[https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/japan-to-create-fund-to-subsidize-parents-during-school-closure-nikkei \"Japan to create fund to subsidize parents during school closure-Nikkei\"].

Consequently, the participants asked the government to remain vigilant in quickly identifying and containing smaller clusters. With more COVID-19 outbreaks around the world, the panel also proposed that new infections from abroad could initiate a \"second wave\" of the disease in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/10900000/000608425.pdf|title=Views on the Novel Coronavirus Disease Control (Summary Version)|last=The Government of Japan, Expert Meeting on the Novel Coronavirus Disease Control|date=9 March 2020|publisher=Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (in English)|access-date=15 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/10900000/000606000.pdf|title=\u65b0\u578b\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u611f\u67d3\u75c7\u5bfe\u7b56\u306e\u898b\u89e3|last=\u65b0\u578b\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u611f\u67d3\u75c7\u5bfe\u7b56\u5c02\u9580\u5bb6\u4f1a\u8b70|language=ja|date=9 March 2020|publisher=Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=15 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 March, the Health Ministry published a disease forecast of each prefecture and instructed their local governments to prepare their hospitals to accommodate its patient estimates.

Nippon.com, 2 March 2020</ref>\n\nOn 25 February, the Abe Administration adopted the \"Basic Policies for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control\" based on the advice that it received from the Expert Meeting.\n\nFirst, the new policies advised local medical institutions that it is better for people with lighter, cold-like symptoms to rely on bed rest at home, rather than seeking medical help from clinics or hospitals. The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.<ref name=\"nippon1\" />\n\nSecond, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease. Government officials revised the previous policy after acknowledging that such specialized institutions would be overwhelmed during a large cluster.\n\nThird, the policy asks those with any cold symptoms to take time off from work and avoid leaving their homes. Government officials urged companies to let employees work from home and commute at off-peak hours. The Japanese government also made an official request to local governments and businesses to cancel large-scale events.\n\nOn 27 February, PM Abe requested the closures of all schools from 2 March to the end of spring vacations, which usually conclude in early April. The next day, the Japanese government announced plans to create a fund to help companies subsidize workers who need to take days off to look after their children while schools are closed.<ref>[https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/japan-to-create-fund-to-subsidize-parents-during-school-closure-nikkei \"Japan to create fund to subsidize parents during school closure-Nikkei\"].

Consequently, the participants asked the government to remain vigilant in quickly identifying and containing smaller clusters.

Although the city of Jerusalem was relatively secure under Christians control, the rest of [[Outremer]] was not. [[Banditry|Bandits]] and marauding [[highwaymen]] preyed upon these Christian pilgrims, who were routinely slaughtered, sometimes by the hundreds, as they attempted to make the journey from the coastline at [[Jaffa]] through to the interior of the Holy Land.{{sfn|Burman|1990|pp=13, 19}}\n[[File:Bandeira Templ\u00e1ria.svg|thumb|Flag used by the Templars in battle.]]\n\nIn 1119, the French [[knight]] [[Hugues de Payens]] approached King [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem]] and [[Warmund, Patriarch of Jerusalem]], and proposed creating a [[monasticism|monastic]] order for the protection of these pilgrims. King Baldwin and Patriarch Warmund agreed to the request, probably at the [[Council of Nablus]] in January 1120, and the king granted the Templars a headquarters in a wing of the royal palace on the [[Temple Mount]] in the captured [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Selwood|first=Dominic|title=Birth of the Order|url=http://www.dominicselwood.com/birth-of-the-order/|accessdate=20 April 2013|date=2013-04-20}}</ref>  The Temple Mount had a mystique because it was above what was believed to be the ruins of the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple of Solomon]].<ref name=HC>[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]], ''Decoding the Past: The Templar Code'', 7 November 2005, video documentary written by Marcy Marzuni.</ref>{{sfn|Barber|1994|p=7}} The Crusaders therefore referred to the Al-Aqsa Mosque as Solomon's Temple, and from this location the new order took the name of ''Poor Knights of Christ and the Temple of Solomon'', or \"Templar\" knights. The order, with about nine knights including [[Godfrey de Saint-Omer]] and [[Andr\u00e9 de Montbard]], had few financial resources and relied on donations to survive. Their emblem was of two knights riding on a single horse, emphasising the order's poverty.{{sfn|Read|2001|p=91}}\n\n[[File:Temple mount.JPG|thumb|left|The first headquarters of the Knights Templar, on the [[Temple Mount]] in Jerusalem. The Crusaders called it \"the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple of Solomon]]\" and from this location derived their name of Templar.]]\n\nThe impoverished status of the Templars did not last long. They had a powerful advocate in Saint [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], a leading Church figure, the French [[abbot]] primarily responsible for the founding of the [[Cistercian Order]] of monks and a nephew of [[Andr\u00e9 de Montbard]], one of the founding knights. Bernard put his weight behind them and wrote persuasively on their behalf in the letter 'In Praise of the New Knighthood',<ref>{{cite web|last=Selwood|first=Dominic|title=The Knights Templar 4: St Bernard of Clairvaux|url=http://www.dominicselwood.com/the-knights-templar-4-st-bernard-of-clairvaux/|accessdate=29 May 2013|date=2013-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630150549/http://www.dominicselwood.com/the-knights-templar-4-st-bernard-of-clairvaux/|archive-date=30 June 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Selwood|first=Dominic|title='Quidam autem dubitaverunt: the Saint, the Sinner and a Possible Chronology', in Autour de la Premi\u00e8re Croisade|year=1996|publisher=Publications de la Sorbonne|location=Paris|isbn=978-2859443085|pages=221\u201330}}</ref> and in 1129, at the [[Council of Troyes 1129|Council of Troyes]], he led a group of leading churchmen to officially approve and endorse the order on behalf of the church. With this formal blessing, the Templars became a favoured charity throughout [[Christendom]], receiving money, land, businesses, and noble-born sons from families who were eager to help with the fight in the [[Holy Land]]. Another major benefit came in 1139, when [[Pope Innocent II]]'s [[papal bull]] ''[[Omne Datum Optimum]]'' exempted the order from obedience to local laws. This ruling meant that the Templars could pass freely through all borders, were not required to pay any taxes, and were exempt from all authority except that of the pope.{{sfn|Burman|1990|p=40}}\n\nWith its clear mission and ample resources, the order grew rapidly. Templars were often the advance [[shock troops]] in key battles of the Crusades, as the heavily armoured knights on their [[horses in warfare|warhorses]] would set out to [[Cavalry tactics#Tactics of heavy cavalry using lances|charge]] at the enemy, ahead of the main army bodies, in an attempt to break opposition lines. One of their most famous victories was in 1177 during the [[Battle of Montgisard]], where some 500 Templar knights helped several thousand infantry to defeat [[Saladin]]'s army of more than 26,000 soldiers.<ref name=Worlds>The History Channel, ''Lost Worlds: Knights Templar'', 10 July 2006, video documentary written and directed by Stuart Elliott.</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n|quote = \"A Templar Knight is truly a fearless knight, and secure on every side, for his soul is protected by the armour of faith, just as his body is protected by the armour of steel.

The others acted in support positions to assist the knights and to manage the financial infrastructure. The Templar Order, though its members were sworn to individual poverty, was given control of wealth beyond direct donations. A nobleman who was interested in participating in the Crusades might place all his assets under Templar management while he was away. Accumulating wealth in this manner throughout Christendom and the Outremer, the order in 1150 began generating [[letter of credit|letters of credit]] for pilgrims journeying to the Holy Land: pilgrims deposited their valuables with a local Templar preceptory before embarking, received a document indicating the value of their deposit, then used that document upon arrival in the Holy Land to retrieve their funds in an amount of treasure of equal value. This innovative arrangement was an early form of [[banking]] and may have been the first formal system to support the use of [[cheque]]s; it improved the safety of pilgrims by making them less attractive targets for thieves, and also contributed to the Templar coffers.<ref name=HC/>{{sfn|Martin|2005|p=}}\n\nBased on this mix of donations and business dealing, the Templars established financial networks across the whole of Christendom. They acquired large tracts of land, both in Europe and the Middle East; they bought and managed farms and vineyards; they built massive stone cathedrals and castles; they were involved in manufacturing, import and export; they had their own fleet of ships; and at one point they even owned the entire island of [[Cyprus]]. The Order of the Knights Templar arguably qualifies as the world's first [[multinational corporation]].<ref name=Worlds/><ref name=KTPedia>{{cite book|author=Ralls, Karen|title=Knights Templar Encyclopedia|page=28|publisher=Career Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-56414-926-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Inside Secret Societies|author=Benson, Michael|page=90|publisher=Kensington Publishing Corp.|year=2005}}</ref>\n\n=== Decline ===\n[[File:Battle of Cresson.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Hattin]] in 1187, the turning point in the Third Crusade]]\nIn the mid-12th century, the tide began to turn in the Crusades. The [[Muslim]] world had become more united under effective leaders such as [[Saladin]]. Dissension arose among Christian factions in and concerning the Holy Land. The Knights Templar were occasionally at odds with the two other Christian [[Military order (society)|military order]]s, the [[Knights Hospitaller]] and the [[Teutonic Order|Teutonic Knights]], and decades of internecine feuds weakened Christian positions, both politically and militarily. After the Templars were involved in several unsuccessful campaigns, including the pivotal [[Battle of Hattin]], Jerusalem was [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|recaptured]] by Muslim forces under Saladin in 1187. The Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] reclaimed the city for Christians in the [[Sixth Crusade]] of 1229, without Templar aid, but only held it briefly for a little more than a decade. In 1244, the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] together with [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarezmi]] mercenaries recaptured Jerusalem, and the city did not return to Western control until 1917 when, during [[World War I]], the [[British people|British]] captured it from the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Martin|2005|p=99}}\n\nThe Templars were forced to relocate their headquarters to other cities in the north, such as the seaport of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], which they held for the next century. It was lost in 1291, followed by their last mainland strongholds, Tortosa ([[Tartus]] in what is now [[Syria]]) and [[Atlit]] in present-day [[Israel]]. Their headquarters then moved to [[Limassol]] on the island of Cyprus,{{sfn|Martin|2005|p=113}} and they also attempted to maintain a garrison on tiny [[Arwad Island]], just off the coast from Tortosa.

Neither was amenable to the idea, but Pope Clement persisted, and in 1306 he invited both Grand Masters to France to discuss the matter. De Molay arrived first in early 1307, but de Villaret was delayed for several months. While waiting, De Molay and Clement discussed criminal charges that had been made two years earlier by an ousted Templar and were being discussed by King [[Philip IV of France]] and his ministers. It was generally agreed that the charges were false, but Clement sent the king a written request for assistance in the investigation. According to some historians, King Philip, who was already deeply in debt to the Templars from his [[Philip IV of France#War against England|war with the English]], decided to seize upon the rumours for his own purposes. He began pressuring the church to take action against the order, as a way of freeing himself from his debts.{{sfn|Barber|2006|p=}} <!-- The French king's motivations went beyond merely financial though. By charging the Templars with heresy, the monarchy was also claiming for itself a charism proper to the papacy.

Although the city of Jerusalem was relatively secure under Christians control, the rest of [[Outremer]] was not. [[Banditry|Bandits]] and marauding [[highwaymen]] preyed upon these Christian pilgrims, who were routinely slaughtered, sometimes by the hundreds, as they attempted to make the journey from the coastline at [[Jaffa]] through to the interior of the Holy Land.{{sfn|Burman|1990|pp=13, 19}}\n[[File:Bandeira Templ\u00e1ria.svg|thumb|Flag used by the Templars in battle.]]\n\nIn 1119, the French [[knight]] [[Hugues de Payens]] approached King [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem]] and [[Warmund, Patriarch of Jerusalem]], and proposed creating a [[monasticism|monastic]] order for the protection of these pilgrims. King Baldwin and Patriarch Warmund agreed to the request, probably at the [[Council of Nablus]] in January 1120, and the king granted the Templars a headquarters in a wing of the royal palace on the [[Temple Mount]] in the captured [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Selwood|first=Dominic|title=Birth of the Order|url=http://www.dominicselwood.com/birth-of-the-order/|accessdate=20 April 2013|date=2013-04-20}}</ref>  The Temple Mount had a mystique because it was above what was believed to be the ruins of the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple of Solomon]].<ref name=HC>[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]], ''Decoding the Past: The Templar Code'', 7 November 2005, video documentary written by Marcy Marzuni.</ref>{{sfn|Barber|1994|p=7}} The Crusaders therefore referred to the Al-Aqsa Mosque as Solomon's Temple, and from this location the new order took the name of ''Poor Knights of Christ and the Temple of Solomon'', or \"Templar\" knights. The order, with about nine knights including [[Godfrey de Saint-Omer]] and [[Andr\u00e9 de Montbard]], had few financial resources and relied on donations to survive. Their emblem was of two knights riding on a single horse, emphasising the order's poverty.{{sfn|Read|2001|p=91}}\n\n[[File:Temple mount.JPG|thumb|left|The first headquarters of the Knights Templar, on the [[Temple Mount]] in Jerusalem. The Crusaders called it \"the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple of Solomon]]\" and from this location derived their name of Templar.]]\n\nThe impoverished status of the Templars did not last long. They had a powerful advocate in Saint [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], a leading Church figure, the French [[abbot]] primarily responsible for the founding of the [[Cistercian Order]] of monks and a nephew of [[Andr\u00e9 de Montbard]], one of the founding knights.

With this formal blessing, the Templars became a favoured charity throughout [[Christendom]], receiving money, land, businesses, and noble-born sons from families who were eager to help with the fight in the [[Holy Land]]. Another major benefit came in 1139, when [[Pope Innocent II]]'s [[papal bull]] ''[[Omne Datum Optimum]]'' exempted the order from obedience to local laws. This ruling meant that the Templars could pass freely through all borders, were not required to pay any taxes, and were exempt from all authority except that of the pope.{{sfn|Burman|1990|p=40}}\n\nWith its clear mission and ample resources, the order grew rapidly. Templars were often the advance [[shock troops]] in key battles of the Crusades, as the heavily armoured knights on their [[horses in warfare|warhorses]] would set out to [[Cavalry tactics#Tactics of heavy cavalry using lances|charge]] at the enemy, ahead of the main army bodies, in an attempt to break opposition lines. One of their most famous victories was in 1177 during the [[Battle of Montgisard]], where some 500 Templar knights helped several thousand infantry to defeat [[Saladin]]'s army of more than 26,000 soldiers.<ref name=Worlds>The History Channel, ''Lost Worlds: Knights Templar'', 10 July 2006, video documentary written and directed by Stuart Elliott.</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n|quote = \"A Templar Knight is truly a fearless knight, and secure on every side, for his soul is protected by the armour of faith, just as his body is protected by the armour of steel.

The others acted in support positions to assist the knights and to manage the financial infrastructure. The Templar Order, though its members were sworn to individual poverty, was given control of wealth beyond direct donations. A nobleman who was interested in participating in the Crusades might place all his assets under Templar management while he was away. Accumulating wealth in this manner throughout Christendom and the Outremer, the order in 1150 began generating [[letter of credit|letters of credit]] for pilgrims journeying to the Holy Land: pilgrims deposited their valuables with a local Templar preceptory before embarking, received a document indicating the value of their deposit, then used that document upon arrival in the Holy Land to retrieve their funds in an amount of treasure of equal value. This innovative arrangement was an early form of [[banking]] and may have been the first formal system to support the use of [[cheque]]s; it improved the safety of pilgrims by making them less attractive targets for thieves, and also contributed to the Templar coffers.<ref name=HC/>{{sfn|Martin|2005|p=}}\n\nBased on this mix of donations and business dealing, the Templars established financial networks across the whole of Christendom. They acquired large tracts of land, both in Europe and the Middle East; they bought and managed farms and vineyards; they built massive stone cathedrals and castles; they were involved in manufacturing, import and export; they had their own fleet of ships; and at one point they even owned the entire island of [[Cyprus]]. The Order of the Knights Templar arguably qualifies as the world's first [[multinational corporation]].<ref name=Worlds/><ref name=KTPedia>{{cite book|author=Ralls, Karen|title=Knights Templar Encyclopedia|page=28|publisher=Career Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-56414-926-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Inside Secret Societies|author=Benson, Michael|page=90|publisher=Kensington Publishing Corp.|year=2005}}</ref>\n\n=== Decline ===\n[[File:Battle of Cresson.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Hattin]] in 1187, the turning point in the Third Crusade]]\nIn the mid-12th century, the tide began to turn in the Crusades. The [[Muslim]] world had become more united under effective leaders such as [[Saladin]]. Dissension arose among Christian factions in and concerning the Holy Land. The Knights Templar were occasionally at odds with the two other Christian [[Military order (society)|military order]]s, the [[Knights Hospitaller]] and the [[Teutonic Order|Teutonic Knights]], and decades of internecine feuds weakened Christian positions, both politically and militarily. After the Templars were involved in several unsuccessful campaigns, including the pivotal [[Battle of Hattin]], Jerusalem was [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|recaptured]] by Muslim forces under Saladin in 1187. The Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] reclaimed the city for Christians in the [[Sixth Crusade]] of 1229, without Templar aid, but only held it briefly for a little more than a decade. In 1244, the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] together with [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarezmi]] mercenaries recaptured Jerusalem, and the city did not return to Western control until 1917 when, during [[World War I]], the [[British people|British]] captured it from the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Martin|2005|p=99}}\n\nThe Templars were forced to relocate their headquarters to other cities in the north, such as the seaport of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], which they held for the next century. It was lost in 1291, followed by their last mainland strongholds, Tortosa ([[Tartus]] in what is now [[Syria]]) and [[Atlit]] in present-day [[Israel]]. Their headquarters then moved to [[Limassol]] on the island of Cyprus,{{sfn|Martin|2005|p=113}} and they also attempted to maintain a garrison on tiny [[Arwad Island]], just off the coast from Tortosa. In 1300, there was some attempt to engage in [[Franco-Mongol alliance|coordinated military efforts with the Mongols]]<ref>Demurger, p. 139 \"During four years, [[Jacques de Molay]] and his order were totally committed, with other Christian forces of Cyprus and Armenia, to an enterprise of reconquest of the Holy Land, in liaison with the offensives of Ghazan, the Mongol Khan of Persia.</ref> via a new invasion force at [[Arwad]]. In 1302 or 1303, however, the Templars lost the island to the Egyptian [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] in the [[Siege of Ruad|Siege of Arwad]]. With the island gone, the Crusaders lost their last foothold in the Holy Land.<ref name=Worlds/><ref>{{harvnb|Nicholson|2001|p=201}} {{quote|The Templars retained a base on Arwad island (also known as Ruad island, formerly Arados) off Tortosa (Tartus) until October 1302 or 1303, when the island was recaptured by the Mamluks.}}</ref>\n\nWith the order's military mission now less important, support for the organization began to dwindle. The situation was complex, however, since during the two hundred years of their existence, the Templars had become a part of daily life throughout Christendom.{{sfn|Nicholson|2001|p=5}} The organisation's Templar Houses, hundreds of which were dotted throughout Europe and the [[Near East]], gave them a widespread presence at the local level.<ref name=\"quantity\"/> The Templars still managed many businesses, and many Europeans had daily contact with the Templar network, such as by working at a Templar farm or [[vineyard]], or using the order as a bank in which to store personal valuables. The order was still not subject to local government, making it everywhere a \"state within a state\" \u2013 its [[standing army]], though it no longer had a well-defined mission, could pass freely through all borders. This situation heightened tensions with some European nobility, especially as the Templars were indicating an interest in founding their own monastic state, just as the [[Teutonic Order|Teutonic Knights]] had done in [[State of the Teutonic Order|Prussia]]{{sfn|Martin|2005|p=}} and the [[Knights Hospitaller]] were doing in [[Rhodes, Greece|Rhodes]].{{sfn|Nicholson|2001|p=237}}\n\n=== Arrests, charges and dissolution ===\nIn 1305, the new [[Pope Clement V]], based in [[Avignon]], France, sent letters to both the Templar Grand Master [[Jacques de Molay]] and the Hospitaller Grand Master [[Foulques de Villaret|Fulk de Villaret]] to discuss the possibility of merging the two orders. Neither was amenable to the idea, but Pope Clement persisted, and in 1306 he invited both Grand Masters to France to discuss the matter. De Molay arrived first in early 1307, but de Villaret was delayed for several months. While waiting, De Molay and Clement discussed criminal charges that had been made two years earlier by an ousted Templar and were being discussed by King [[Philip IV of France]] and his ministers. It was generally agreed that the charges were false, but Clement sent the king a written request for assistance in the investigation. According to some historians, King Philip, who was already deeply in debt to the Templars from his [[Philip IV of France#War against England|war with the English]], decided to seize upon the rumours for his own purposes. He began pressuring the church to take action against the order, as a way of freeing himself from his debts.{{sfn|Barber|2006|p=}} <!-- The French king's motivations went beyond merely financial though. By charging the Templars with heresy, the monarchy was also claiming for itself a charism proper to the papacy.
