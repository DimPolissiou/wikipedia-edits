Their 1981 album, ''[[High 'n' Dry]]'', was produced by [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]], who helped them begin to define their style, and the album's main track \"[[Bringin' On the Heartbreak]]\" became one of the first rock videos played on [[MTV]] in 1982.

In the U.S., ''Pyromania'' was certified diamond (10\u00d7 platinum), making Def Leppard among the most popular music groups at the time.

The [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] name was reactivated when they are awarded a franchise, to play in the east division. The [[Detroit Whalers]] became the [[Plymouth Whalers]]. Eighteen teams each played 66 games. The [[Guelph Storm]] won the [[J. Ross Robertson Cup]], defeating the [[Ottawa 67's]].\n\n==Expansion==\n===Toronto St. Michael's Majors===\nOn August 15, 1996, the [[Ontario Hockey League]] announced that the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] would join the league as an expansion team, beginning in the 1997-98 season. The Majors would play their home games at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], in which they shared the arena with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]]. The Majors would join the East Division.\n\nPreviously, the Toronto St. Michael's Majors were a junior hockey franchise from 1906-1962, as they ceased operations at the conclusion of the 1961-62 season. The Majors won the [[Memorial Cup]] in [[1934 Memorial Cup|1934]], [[1945 Memorial Cup|1945]], [[1947 Memorial Cup|1947]] and [[1961 Memorial Cup|1961]].\n\nThe Majors were the first OHL franchise based out of [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto]] in eight years, as their previous franchise, the [[Toronto Marlboros]], relocated to [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] following the [[1988-89 OHL season|1988-89]] season.\n\n==Rebranding==\n===Detroit Whalers to Plymouth Whalers===\nThe [[Detroit Whalers]] rebranded their team as the [[Plymouth Whalers]] during the summer of 1997. The Whalers franchise moved to the [[Compuware Sports Arena]] in [[1996-97 OHL season|1996-97]], which is located in [[Plymouth, Michigan|Plymouth]]. The team would retain their current team name and uniforms.\n\n==Realignment==\nThe newest [[Ontario Hockey League]] club, the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]], joined the East Division. Due to the Majors joining the East, the OHL moved the [[North Bay Centennials]] from the East Division to the Central Division, while the [[Erie Otters]] moved from the Central Division to the West Division.

The [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] name was reactivated when they are awarded a franchise, to play in the east division. The [[Detroit Whalers]] became the [[Plymouth Whalers]]. Eighteen teams each played 66 games. The [[Guelph Storm]] won the [[J. Ross Robertson Cup]], defeating the [[Ottawa 67's]].\n\n==Expansion==\n===Toronto St. Michael's Majors===\nOn August 15, 1996, the [[Ontario Hockey League]] announced that the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] would join the league as an expansion team, beginning in the 1997-98 season. The Majors would play their home games at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], in which they shared the arena with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]]. The Majors would join the East Division.\n\nPreviously, the Toronto St. Michael's Majors were a junior hockey franchise from 1906-1962, as they ceased operations at the conclusion of the 1961-62 season. The Majors won the [[Memorial Cup]] in [[1934 Memorial Cup|1934]], [[1945 Memorial Cup|1945]], [[1947 Memorial Cup|1947]] and [[1961 Memorial Cup|1961]].\n\nThe Majors were the first OHL franchise based out of [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto]] in eight years, as their previous franchise, the [[Toronto Marlboros]], relocated to [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] following the [[1988-89 OHL season|1988-89]] season.\n\n==Rebranding==\n===Detroit Whalers to Plymouth Whalers===\nThe [[Detroit Whalers]] rebranded their team as the [[Plymouth Whalers]] during the summer of 1997. The Whalers franchise moved to the [[Compuware Sports Arena]] in [[1996-97 OHL season|1996-97]], which is located in [[Plymouth, Michigan|Plymouth]]. The team would retain their current team name and uniforms.\n\n==Realignment==\nThe newest [[Ontario Hockey League]] club, the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]], joined the East Division. Due to the Majors joining the East, the OHL moved the [[North Bay Centennials]] from the East Division to the Central Division, while the [[Erie Otters]] moved from the Central Division to the West Division. This created three six-team divisions in the 18 team league.\n\n==Regular Season==\n===Final standings===\n''Note: DIV = Division; GP = Games played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; OTL = Overtime Losses; GF = Goals For; GA = Goals Against; PTS = Points; x = clinched playoff berth; y = clinched division title; z = earned first round bye''\n\n=== East Division ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! width=\"7.5%\"| Rank\n! width=\"25.5%\"| Team\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GP\n! width=\"7.5%\"| W\n! width=\"7.5%\"| L\n! width=\"7.5%\"| T\n! width=\"7.5%\"| PTS\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GF\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GA\n|-\n| 1 || align=left| z-[[Ottawa 67's]] || 66 || 40 || 17 || 9 || '''89''' || 286 || 172\n|-\n| 2 || align=left| x-[[Belleville Bulls]] || 66 || 41 || 22 || 3 || '''85''' || 315 || 239\n|-\n| 3 || align=left| x-[[Kingston Frontenacs]] || 66 || 35 || 27 || 4 || '''74''' || 330 || 275\n|-\n| 4 || align=left| x-[[Oshawa Generals]] || 66 || 26 || 32 || 8 || '''60''' || 214 || 247\n|-\n| 5 || align=left| x-[[Peterborough Petes]] || 66 || 20 || 36 || 10 || '''50''' || 212 || 273\n|- style=\"background-color:#cccccc;\"\n| || || || || || || || ||\n|-\n| 6 || align=left| [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] || 66 || 15 || 42 || 9 || '''39''' || 154 || 265\n|}\n\n=== Central Division ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! width=\"7.5%\"| Rank\n! width=\"25.5%\"| Team\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GP\n! width=\"7.5%\"| W\n! width=\"7.5%\"| L\n! width=\"7.5%\"| T\n! width=\"7.5%\"| PTS\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GF\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GA\n|-\n| 1 || align=left| z-[[Guelph Storm]] || 66 || 42 || 18 || 6 || '''90''' || 263 || 189\n|-\n| 2 || align=left| x-[[Barrie Colts]] || 66 || 38 || 23 || 5 || '''81''' || 236 || 215\n|-\n| 3 || align=left| x-[[Kitchener Rangers]] || 66 || 27 || 29 || 10 || '''64''' || 224 || 239\n|-\n| 4 || align=left| x-[[Owen Sound Platers]] || 66 || 27 || 34 || 5 || '''59''' || 270 || 312\n|-\n| 5 || align=left| x-[[Sudbury Wolves]] || 66 || 25 || 34 || 7 || '''57''' || 257 || 268\n|- style=\"background-color:#cccccc;\"\n| || || || || || || || ||\n|-\n| 6 || align=left| [[North Bay Centennials]] || 66 || 15 || 45 || 6 || '''36''' || 213 || 291\n|}\n\n=== West Division ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! width=\"7.5%\"| Rank\n! width=\"25.5%\"| Team\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GP\n! width=\"7.5%\"| W\n! width=\"7.5%\"| L\n! width=\"7.5%\"| T\n! width=\"7.5%\"| PTS\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GF\n! width=\"7.5%\"| GA\n|-\n| 1 || align=left| y-[[London Knights]] || 66 || 40 || 21 || 5 || '''85''' || 301 || 238\n|-\n| 2 || align=left| x-[[Plymouth Whalers]] || 66 || 37 || 22 || 7 || '''81''' || 279 || 223\n|-\n| 3 || align=left| x-[[Sarnia Sting]] || 66 || 32 || 21 || 13 || '''77''' || 253 || 227\n|-\n| 4 || align=left| x-[[Erie Otters]] || 66 || 33 || 28 || 5 || '''71''' || 261 || 252\n|- style=\"background-color:#cccccc;\"\n| || || || || || || || ||\n|-\n| 5 || align=left| [[Sault Ste.
