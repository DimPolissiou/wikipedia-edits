Tim is contacted by the police of Ryme City, a city where humans and Pok\u00e9mon live together in harmony; catching and battling Pok\u00e9mon is outlawed. He is informed of his father's death in a car accident.\n\nTim goes to Harry's apartment to sort things out and meets a [[deerstalker]]-clad [[Pikachu]] that can talk and be understood by him, though all others simply hear him say \"Pika.\" Tim accidentally releases a mysterious purple gas, \"R,\" from a vial he finds in Harry's office; they are then attacked by a party of [[Aipom]]{{efn|name=plural|As written in [[Pok\u00e9mon#Name|the \"Name\" section of the main ''Pok\u00e9mon'' article]], \"' Pok\u00e9mon' is [[English plurals#Nouns with identical singular and plural|identical in the singular and plural]], as is each individual species name; it is grammatically correct to say 'one Pok\u00e9mon' and 'many Pok\u00e9mon', as well as 'one Pikachu' and 'many Pikachu'.\"<ref name=\"KaufeldSmith2006\">{{cite book|author1=John Kaufeld|author2=Jeremy Smith|title=Trading Card Games For Dummies|url=https://archive.org/details/tradingcardgames00kauf|url-access=registration|accessdate=April 25, 2013|page=[https://archive.org/details/tradingcardgames00kauf/page/81 81]|date=June 13, 2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-04407-0}}</ref>}} who become rabid under the gas's influence.\n\nThe pair escape and Pikachu explains he has [[amnesia]] and his only clue to his identity is Harry's name and address on his cap, leading him to believe he was Harry's partner and that Harry survived the crash. They meet an informant of Harry's, a [[Mr. Mime]] who directs them to an underground illegal Pok\u00e9mon battle arena. The arena's owner Sebastian recognizes Pikachu, who had injured his [[Charizard]] in a previous battle, and demands a rematch. He doses Charizard with the purple gas, stirring it into a violent rage, and Pikachu is unable to summon his electrical powers to fight back. While attempting to save Pikachu, Tim knocks Sebastian over and breaks several gas vials in his jacket, sending the arena's Pok\u00e9mon into a frenzy. The arena is raided by police and Tim is taken by Lieutenant Yoshida, who worked with his father.\n\nTim and Pikachu are contacted by Howard Clifford, the wheelchair-bound founder of Ryme City and founder of Clifford Industries. Howard reveals Harry survived and was taken by an advanced form of [[Mewtwo]], who erased Pikachu's memory. He warns Tim that his son Roger is behind the gas, \"R\", and if he finds Mewtwo, he can find his father. Tim and Pikachu recruit aspiring journalist Lucy Stevens and travel to the lab facility Harry was investigating. The lab had been experimenting on Mewtwo and synthesized R from its genes. They are attacked by genetically enhanced [[Greninja]] and Pikachu is gravely injured. Tim begs a [[Bulbasaur]] for a healer Pok\u00e9mon and it leads him to Mewtwo, who heals Pikachu. Mewtwo is then captured by Roger. Pikachu remembers that he helped Mewtwo escape from the lab and believes he had betrayed Harry. Not trusting himself, he leaves Tim.\n\nPikachu comes across the scene of the car crash and finds evidence that it was the Greninja, not Mewtwo, who was responsible. In Ryme City, Howard reveals the captured Mewtwo to Tim, exposing himself as the true mastermind: he takes control of Mewtwo's body using a [[Brain\u2013computer interface|neural-link]] helmet that places his mind inside Mewtwo's while his body remains in the wheelchair. He explains that Mewtwo can fuse humans and Pok\u00e9mon, allowing humans to evolve as Pok\u00e9mon can and become one with them, but this can only be done if the Pok\u00e9mon is in a confused state, thus the need for the R gas. This also means that disabilities like Howard's won't exist. Believing this is the future of humankind, Howard releases the gas across the city and begins fusing humans with their Pok\u00e9mon. Pikachu summons his electrical powers to battle Mewtwo while Tim fights Howard's genetically-modified [[Ditto (Pokemon)|Ditto]], who had been impersonating Roger: the real Roger had been tied up and gagged with duct tape by his father. Tim manages to remove Howard's helmet from his body, freeing Mewtwo from his control.\n\nMewtwo restores the city inhabitants to normal, Howard is arrested, and Roger hires Lucy as a full-time reporter, promising the city that he will fix his father's mistakes. Mewtwo explains that Harry tried to save him from Howard and helped Mewtwo escape, but was attacked by the Greninja. Pikachu had volunteered to have his consciousness fused with Harry\u2019s while Mewtwo heal his body by keep it with him, the experience erasing both their memories. Mewtwo separates their consciousnesses and Harry reunites with Tim in his human body.\n\nTim decides to stay in Ryme City to become a detective and spend more time with his father and Pikachu.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Harry Goodman, Tim's missing father and a veteran Ryme City police detective.\n* [[Justice Smith]] as Tim Goodman, a former [[Pok\u00e9mon trainer]] looking for his missing father.

He is informed of his father's death in a car accident.\n\nTim goes to Harry's apartment to sort things out and meets a [[deerstalker]]-clad [[Pikachu]] that can talk and be understood by him, though all others simply hear him say \"Pika.\" Tim accidentally releases a mysterious purple gas, \"R,\" from a vial he finds in Harry's office; they are then attacked by a party of [[Aipom]]{{efn|name=plural|As written in [[Pok\u00e9mon#Name|the \"Name\" section of the main ''Pok\u00e9mon'' article]], \"' Pok\u00e9mon' is [[English plurals#Nouns with identical singular and plural|identical in the singular and plural]], as is each individual species name; it is grammatically correct to say 'one Pok\u00e9mon' and 'many Pok\u00e9mon', as well as 'one Pikachu' and 'many Pikachu'.\"<ref name=\"KaufeldSmith2006\">{{cite book|author1=John Kaufeld|author2=Jeremy Smith|title=Trading Card Games For Dummies|url=https://archive.org/details/tradingcardgames00kauf|url-access=registration|accessdate=April 25, 2013|page=[https://archive.org/details/tradingcardgames00kauf/page/81 81]|date=June 13, 2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-04407-0}}</ref>}} who become rabid under the gas's influence.\n\nThe pair escape and Pikachu explains he has [[amnesia]] and his only clue to his identity is Harry's name and address on his cap, leading him to believe he was Harry's partner and that Harry survived the crash. They meet an informant of Harry's, a [[Mr. Mime]] who directs them to an underground illegal Pok\u00e9mon battle arena. The arena's owner Sebastian recognizes Pikachu, who had injured his [[Charizard]] in a previous battle, and demands a rematch. He doses Charizard with the purple gas, stirring it into a violent rage, and Pikachu is unable to summon his electrical powers to fight back. While attempting to save Pikachu, Tim knocks Sebastian over and breaks several gas vials in his jacket, sending the arena's Pok\u00e9mon into a frenzy. The arena is raided by police and Tim is taken by Lieutenant Yoshida, who worked with his father.\n\nTim and Pikachu are contacted by Howard Clifford, the wheelchair-bound founder of Ryme City and founder of Clifford Industries. Howard reveals Harry survived and was taken by an advanced form of [[Mewtwo]], who erased Pikachu's memory. He warns Tim that his son Roger is behind the gas, \"R\", and if he finds Mewtwo, he can find his father. Tim and Pikachu recruit aspiring journalist Lucy Stevens and travel to the lab facility Harry was investigating. The lab had been experimenting on Mewtwo and synthesized R from its genes. They are attacked by genetically enhanced [[Greninja]] and Pikachu is gravely injured. Tim begs a [[Bulbasaur]] for a healer Pok\u00e9mon and it leads him to Mewtwo, who heals Pikachu. Mewtwo is then captured by Roger. Pikachu remembers that he helped Mewtwo escape from the lab and believes he had betrayed Harry. Not trusting himself, he leaves Tim.\n\nPikachu comes across the scene of the car crash and finds evidence that it was the Greninja, not Mewtwo, who was responsible. In Ryme City, Howard reveals the captured Mewtwo to Tim, exposing himself as the true mastermind: he takes control of Mewtwo's body using a [[Brain\u2013computer interface|neural-link]] helmet that places his mind inside Mewtwo's while his body remains in the wheelchair. He explains that Mewtwo can fuse humans and Pok\u00e9mon, allowing humans to evolve as Pok\u00e9mon can and become one with them, but this can only be done if the Pok\u00e9mon is in a confused state, thus the need for the R gas. This also means that disabilities like Howard's won't exist. Believing this is the future of humankind, Howard releases the gas across the city and begins fusing humans with their Pok\u00e9mon. Pikachu summons his electrical powers to battle Mewtwo while Tim fights Howard's genetically-modified [[Ditto (Pokemon)|Ditto]], who had been impersonating Roger: the real Roger had been tied up and gagged with duct tape by his father. Tim manages to remove Howard's helmet from his body, freeing Mewtwo from his control.\n\nMewtwo restores the city inhabitants to normal, Howard is arrested, and Roger hires Lucy as a full-time reporter, promising the city that he will fix his father's mistakes. Mewtwo explains that Harry tried to save him from Howard and helped Mewtwo escape, but was attacked by the Greninja. Pikachu had volunteered to have his consciousness fused with Harry\u2019s while Mewtwo heal his body by keep it with him, the experience erasing both their memories. Mewtwo separates their consciousnesses and Harry reunites with Tim in his human body.\n\nTim decides to stay in Ryme City to become a detective and spend more time with his father and Pikachu.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Harry Goodman, Tim's missing father and a veteran Ryme City police detective.\n* [[Justice Smith]] as Tim Goodman, a former [[Pok\u00e9mon trainer]] looking for his missing father.

Among them were more than one culture who built earthwork mounds, monuments which generally expressed their cosmology, often with links to astronomical events.\n\nBetween 100 BC and AD 500, the [[Hopewell culture]] built the multi-earthwork complex on the terrace east of the Muskingum River near its mouth with the Ohio. It is now known as the Marietta Earthworks. Developed over many years, it had a large enclosed square, within which were four platform mounds, used for ceremonial purposes and elite residential; another square, and a larger conical mound used for burials. A walled, graded path led to the river's edge.<ref name=\"OHC\" /> By the time of the historic tribes, such as the [[Shawnee]], the purposes and makers of the monuments were no longer known.\n\n===Settlement===\nFrench explorers entered this area in the 18th century, and in 1749 buried numerous leaden plates to mark their claim to the Ohio Country (which they called the Illinois Territory, as they had more settlements near the [[Mississippi River]].) They later ceded their territory east of the Mississippi to Great Britain after the [[French and Indian War]]. Two of their plates were discovered in the Marietta area in 1798, and one was replicated for what is known as the French monument, erected in the 20th century. (See photo at right.)\n\nIn 1770, the future [[U.S. president]] [[George Washington]], then a [[Surveyor (surveying)|surveyor]], began exploring large tracts of land west of his native [[Virginia]]. During the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], Washington told his friend General [[Rufus Putnam]] of the beauty he had seen in his travels through the [[Ohio Valley]] and of his ideas for settling the territory.\n\nAfter the American Revolutionary War, the United States sold or granted large tracts of land to stimulate development in this area. Marietta was founded by settlers from [[New England]] who were investors in the [[Ohio Company of Associates]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1913&dat=19700502&id=cn8gAAAAIBAJ&sjid=hGgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=823,280187]</ref> It was the first of numerous [[New England]] settlements in what was then the [[Northwest Territory]].<ref name=\"New England page 175\">Lois Kimball Mathews, ''The Expansion of New England: The Spread of New England Settlement and Institutions to the Mississippi River, 1620\u20131865'', page 175</ref> These New Englanders, or \"[[Yankee]]s\" as they were called, were descended from the [[Puritan]] English colonists who had settled [[New England]] in the 1600s and were primarily [[Congregationalist church|Congregationalists]].

In 1798 the Muskingum Academy was built on the site of the 19th century Marietta Congregationalist Church. The academy building served for both educational and religious purposes.<ref>Dickinson, Rev.

Eager to develop additional lands, the new government decided to pay veterans of the Revolution with [[Warrant (finance)|warrants]] for land in the [[Northwest Territory]], which was organized under federal authority in 1787 by the [[Northwest Ordinance]]. Competing states had agreed to end their claims to the lands; Pennsylvania and Virginia received some lands in a settlement. [[Arthur St. Clair]] was appointed by the president as governor of the new territory.\n\nThe [[Ohio Company of Associates]] had supported provisions in the ordinance to allow veterans to use their warrants to purchase the land. They bought 1.5 million [[acres]] (6,100&nbsp;km\u00b2) of land from [[Congress of the United States|Congress]]. On April 7, 1788, [[American Pioneers to the Northwest Territory|48 men]] of the Ohio Company of Associates, led by General Putnam, arrived at the confluence of the [[Muskingum River|Muskingum]] and [[Ohio]] rivers. The site was on the east side of the Muskingum River, across from [[Fort Harmar]], a military outpost built three years prior.\n\nBringing with them the first government sanctioned by the US for this area,<ref name=\"Hildreth\">Hildreth, S.

The Americans named Marietta in honor of [[Marie Antoinette]], the Queen of [[France]], who had aided the colonies in their battle for independence from Great Britain.\n\nThe Indians were unhappy to see white settlers moving into their territory. The latter immediately started construction of two forts: [[Campus Martius (Ohio)|Campus Martius]], whose former site is now occupied by the [[Campus Martius Museum|museum of the same name]], and [[Picketed Point Stockade]], at the [[confluence]] of the Muskingum and Ohio rivers. At the same time, the settlers started developing their community, platted according to plans they had made in Boston.\n[[File:CampusMartius.jpg|thumb|right|Campus Martius fort at Marietta, with conical Great Mound visible in background to right of tree]][[File:PicketedPointMariettaOH.jpg|thumb|right|Picketed Point stockade at Marietta]]\n\nIn 1788, George Washington said: {{cquote|No colony in America was ever settled under such favorable auspices as that which has just commenced at the Muskingum. ...

By the end of 1788, 137 people populated the area.\n\nIn 1789, the United States signed the [[Treaty of Fort Harmar]] with several Indian tribes that occupied areas of the [[Northwest Territory]], to settle issues related to trade, as well as the boundary between their lands and United States settlement. The US did not address the Indians' major grievance about American settlers moving into their lands, particularly in the [[Western Reserve]], where there were disputes over land. Although Congress authorized Governor [[Arthur St. Clair]] to give land back to the Indians, he did not do so. Conflict increased as the Indians tried to push the settlers out. After years of warfare in the region, they were defeated. The US signed the [[Treaty of Greenville]] (1795) with the Indians, which secured the safety of settlers to leave the forts and develop their farms.\n\nThe settlers held services regularly and chartered the first church in 1799.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Murray|first=Charles Augustus|title=Praire-bird|publisher=|year=1845|isbn=|location=|pages=3}}</ref> It was a [[Congregational church|Congregational]] institution; its charter was unusually inclusive due to the varied religious backgrounds of its members.

During that first winter, they began a basic school for the children at Campus Martius. In 1797, settlers founded Muskingum Academy. The town had numerous [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]], and Ephraim Cutler was instrumental as a state delegate in 1802 at the state convention in swaying the vote for the state to be free of slavery.<ref name=\"Yeager\">[http://travel.nytimes.com/2009/11/06/travel/escapes/06amer.html?8dpc Robert C.

It was used as a station on the [[Underground Railroad]] to help [[slaves]] escape from the South.<ref name=\"Yeager\" /> [[Ohio University]] was founded earlier in [[Athens, Ohio|Athens]], on land reserved for public education under the Northwest Ordinance.\n\nThe settlers preserved the Great Mound, or ''Conus,'' by planning their own [[Mound Cemetery (Marietta, Ohio)|cemetery]] around it. They also preserved the two largest platform mounds, which they called ''Capitolinus'' and ''Quadrophenus.'' The former was developed as the site for the city library.<ref name=\"OHC\" /> As of 1900, the [[Mound Cemetery (Marietta, Ohio)|Mound Cemetery]] had the highest number of burials of Revolutionary War officers in the nation, indicating the nature of the generation that settled Marietta.<ref>[[Daughters of the American Revolution]] (DAR): ''American Monthly'', Vol. 16, Jan\u2013Jun 1900, New York: R.

Artisans built oceangoing vessels and sailed them downriver to the [[Mississippi river|Mississippi]] and south to New Orleans and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. In less than two decades after settlement, the [[steamboat]] had been developed, and was also constructed here. Brick factories and [[sawmill]]s supplied materials for homes and public buildings. An iron mill, along with several foundries, provided rails for the growing [[railroad]] industry; the Marietta Chair Factory made [[furniture]].\n\n[[File:Marietta Works Squier and Davis Plate XXVI.jpg|thumb|right|upright|1837 Survey of Marietta Earthworks]]\nInterest in the prehistoric culture that built the Marietta Earthworks continued. The complex was surveyed and drawn by [[E. G. Squier|Ephraim George Squier]] and [[Edwin Hamilton Davis]], whose large project on numerous prehistoric mounds throughout the Ohio and Mississippi valleys was published by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1848 as ''[[Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley]].'' It was the first book published by the Smithsonian. Their drawing to the right shows the plan of the original complex, which \"included a large square enclosure surrounding four flat-topped pyramidal mounds, another smaller square, and a circular enclosure with a large burial mound at its center.\"<ref name=\"OHC\">[http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2219 \"Marietta Earthworks\"], Ohio History Central, accessed August 20, 2012</ref> The walled, graded path, called by the settlers the ''[[Sacra Via]]'', led from the largest enclosure to the lower river's edge. This pathway was destroyed in 1843 during mid-nineteenth century development.<ref name=\"OHC\" />\n\n===Railroads and oil===\nLocal development began with the [[Belpre and Cincinnati Railroad]] (B&C); it was founded in 1845. It was intended to connect from [[Belpre, Ohio]], the next town downriver, to a planned [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&O) spur to [[Parkersburg, West Virginia|Parkersburg]]. But, for years, the Virginia government did not allow the B&O to construct track south of [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]]. In 1851 developers changed the Ohio state terminus to Marietta and changed the name of the railroad to the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad that year. The right-of-way for an alternate connection to the B&O extended upriver from Marietta to [[Bellaire, Ohio]]. The M&C was bankrupt by 1857, but construction of track continued west to reach [[Cincinnati]]. The first through-train from Cincinnati ran on April 9, 1857. The M&C got out of bankruptcy in 1860.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nIn 1871, the Ohio Valley Railroad was formed and for the next two years built tracks going north for 103 miles. Their home office was in Marietta, with treasurer offices in Pittsburgh. The Ohio Valley railroad was reorganized as the Marietta and Cleveland. The Pennsylvania Railroad in its expansion later purchased the railroad and its right-of-way between Marietta and Bellaire.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nPassengers traveling between Marietta and Parkersburg, Virginia (now West Virginia) had to take a steamboat for the 14 miles between the two towns and transfer. With help from the B&O and the Baltimore City Council, the Union Railroad finally connected Marietta to [[Belpre, Ohio]] in 1860. Later absorbed by the B&O, this section of track is still in operation (2008), with unit coal trains providing most of the traffic.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe planned [[Parkersburg Bridge (CSX)|bridge]] from Parkersburg across the Ohio River to Belpre was finally built 1868\u20131870 by the B&O, as part of its main line from Baltimore to [[St. Louis, Missouri]].<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hh:@field(DOCID+@lit(WV0105)) ''Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, Parkersburg Bridge, Ohio River, Parkersburg, Wood County, WV''], Historic American Engineering Record, accessed August 22, 2012</ref> This cut Marietta off from traffic and trade, although it retained local and Ohio service. In the early 20th century, 24 passenger trains served Marietta each day, most of which ran on the PRR tracks.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n[[William P. Cutler]] was a major figure in the M&C. He also backed the [[Union Railroad (Ohio)|Union Railroad]] and the Marietta, Columbus and Cleveland Railroad, among other local railroads. Cutler served as General Manager and as President of the M&C for many years.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nIn 1860, oil was first drilled in the Marietta region. Oil booms in 1875 and 1910 made investors rich, who constructed numerous lavish houses in town, of which many still stand.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2009/11/06/travel/escapes/06amer.html?hpw |work=The New York Times |title=A Historic River Town Where the West Began |first=Robert C. |last=Yeager |date=November 6, 2009 |accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> The Dawes brothers of Marietta founded the [[Pure Oil Company]].{{when|date=March 2017}} All four brothers became nationally prominent businessmen and/or politicians: [[Charles Gates Dawes]], [[Rufus C.

In 1925, he shared the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], based on his work on the [[Dawes Plan]] and relieving an international crisis in 1923 related to German reparations after [[World War I]].\n\nIn 1880, the first [[Putnam Street Bridge]] was opened to connect Marietta to Fort Harmar. It provided the first free crossing of the [[Muskingum River]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===20th century===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nAs transportation advanced along railroads and highways, Marietta was initially passed by. From 1868\u20131870, the [[B & O Railroad]] built a bridge to connect [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]] and Belpre; and the [[National Road]] went further north through [[Zanesville, Ohio|Zanesville]].\n\nBut, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] expanded in the late 19th century and had a station in Marietta, running 26 daily trains between Marietta and [[Pittsburgh]]. After WWII passenger service decreased as the railroads restructured and the federal government invested in highway construction. The last rail passenger service ended in 1953. Marietta was relatively isolated from new travel routes until 1967, when [[I-77]] was opened with close access to the city.\n\nBefore the United States entered the Great War, a group of 23 young men went from Marietta College to serve in France in 1917 as an ambulance unit; four died in battle. In 1937\u20131938, during the US celebration of the Northwest Territory, France gave a plaque to the city of Marietta, which was installed on the French monument, to commemorate these young men and their service. (See photo at right.)\n\nIn 1939, the [[Sons and Daughters of Pioneer Rivermen]] was established in Marietta during the [[Great Depression]] to celebrate the city's substantial river history and its people.

Marietta is located in southeastern Ohio at the mouth of the [[Muskingum River]] at its confluence with the [[Ohio River]] 11 miles northeast of [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]]. The population was 14,085 at the [[United States Census 2010|2010 census]].\n\nIt is the second-largest city in the [[Parkersburg-Marietta-Vienna metropolitan area|Parkersburg-Marietta-Vienna, WV-OH Combined Statistical Area]]. The private, nonsectarian [[liberal arts]] [[Marietta College]] is located here. It was a station on the [[Underground Railroad]] before the Civil War.

Among them were more than one culture who built earthwork mounds, monuments which generally expressed their cosmology, often with links to astronomical events.\n\nBetween 100 BC and AD 500, the [[Hopewell culture]] built the multi-earthwork complex on the terrace east of the Muskingum River near its mouth with the Ohio. It is now known as the Marietta Earthworks. Developed over many years, it had a large enclosed square, within which were four platform mounds, used for ceremonial purposes and elite residential; another square, and a larger conical mound used for burials. A walled, graded path led to the river's edge.<ref name=\"OHC\" /> By the time of the historic tribes, such as the [[Shawnee]], the purposes and makers of the monuments were no longer known.\n\n===Settlement===\nFrench explorers entered this area in the 18th century, and in 1749 buried numerous leaden plates to mark their claim to the Ohio Country (which they called the Illinois Territory, as they had more settlements near the [[Mississippi River]].) They later ceded their territory east of the Mississippi to Great Britain after the [[French and Indian War]]. Two of their plates were discovered in the Marietta area in 1798, and one was replicated for what is known as the French monument, erected in the 20th century. (See photo at right.)\n\nIn 1770, the future [[U.S. president]] [[George Washington]], then a [[Surveyor (surveying)|surveyor]], began exploring large tracts of land west of his native [[Virginia]]. During the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], Washington told his friend General [[Rufus Putnam]] of the beauty he had seen in his travels through the [[Ohio Valley]] and of his ideas for settling the territory.\n\nAfter the American Revolutionary War, the United States sold or granted large tracts of land to stimulate development in this area. Marietta was founded by settlers from [[New England]] who were investors in the [[Ohio Company of Associates]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1913&dat=19700502&id=cn8gAAAAIBAJ&sjid=hGgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=823,280187]</ref> It was the first of numerous [[New England]] settlements in what was then the [[Northwest Territory]].<ref name=\"New England page 175\">Lois Kimball Mathews, ''The Expansion of New England: The Spread of New England Settlement and Institutions to the Mississippi River, 1620\u20131865'', page 175</ref> These New Englanders, or \"[[Yankee]]s\" as they were called, were descended from the [[Puritan]] English colonists who had settled [[New England]] in the 1600s and were primarily [[Congregationalist church|Congregationalists]]. The first church constructed in Marietta was a Congregationalist church, founded around 1786.<ref name=\"New England page 175\" /> Before the mid-1790s services were held at the fort or in Munsell's Hall at nearby Point Harmar. In 1798 the Muskingum Academy was built on the site of the 19th century Marietta Congregationalist Church. The academy building served for both educational and religious purposes.<ref>Dickinson, Rev.

Eager to develop additional lands, the new government decided to pay veterans of the Revolution with [[Warrant (finance)|warrants]] for land in the [[Northwest Territory]], which was organized under federal authority in 1787 by the [[Northwest Ordinance]]. Competing states had agreed to end their claims to the lands; Pennsylvania and Virginia received some lands in a settlement. [[Arthur St. Clair]] was appointed by the president as governor of the new territory.\n\nThe [[Ohio Company of Associates]] had supported provisions in the ordinance to allow veterans to use their warrants to purchase the land. They bought 1.5 million [[acres]] (6,100&nbsp;km\u00b2) of land from [[Congress of the United States|Congress]]. On April 7, 1788, [[American Pioneers to the Northwest Territory|48 men]] of the Ohio Company of Associates, led by General Putnam, arrived at the confluence of the [[Muskingum River|Muskingum]] and [[Ohio]] rivers. The site was on the east side of the Muskingum River, across from [[Fort Harmar]], a military outpost built three years prior.\n\nBringing with them the first government sanctioned by the US for this area,<ref name=\"Hildreth\">Hildreth, S.

Marie, Michigan]], 1668; [[Cahokia, Illinois]], 1696, [[Detroit]], 1701; [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]], 1703, [[Ouiatenon, Indiana]], 1717, [[Prairie du Rocher, Illinois]], 1720; [[Vincennes, Indiana]], 1732, [[Clarksville, Indiana]], 1783, [[Martin's Ferry, Ohio]], 1785, Fort Finney/[[Jeffersonville, Indiana]], 1786, most settled by ethnic French colonists from Canada.) The Americans named Marietta in honor of [[Marie Antoinette]], the Queen of [[France]], who had aided the colonies in their battle for independence from Great Britain.\n\nThe Indians were unhappy to see white settlers moving into their territory. The latter immediately started construction of two forts: [[Campus Martius (Ohio)|Campus Martius]], whose former site is now occupied by the [[Campus Martius Museum|museum of the same name]], and [[Picketed Point Stockade]], at the [[confluence]] of the Muskingum and Ohio rivers. At the same time, the settlers started developing their community, platted according to plans they had made in Boston.\n[[File:CampusMartius.jpg|thumb|right|Campus Martius fort at Marietta, with conical Great Mound visible in background to right of tree]][[File:PicketedPointMariettaOH.jpg|thumb|right|Picketed Point stockade at Marietta]]\n\nIn 1788, George Washington said: {{cquote|No colony in America was ever settled under such favorable auspices as that which has just commenced at the Muskingum. ...

By the end of 1788, 137 people populated the area.\n\nIn 1789, the United States signed the [[Treaty of Fort Harmar]] with several Indian tribes that occupied areas of the [[Northwest Territory]], to settle issues related to trade, as well as the boundary between their lands and United States settlement. The US did not address the Indians' major grievance about American settlers moving into their lands, particularly in the [[Western Reserve]], where there were disputes over land. Although Congress authorized Governor [[Arthur St. Clair]] to give land back to the Indians, he did not do so. Conflict increased as the Indians tried to push the settlers out. After years of warfare in the region, they were defeated. The US signed the [[Treaty of Greenville]] (1795) with the Indians, which secured the safety of settlers to leave the forts and develop their farms.\n\nThe settlers held services regularly and chartered the first church in 1799.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Murray|first=Charles Augustus|title=Praire-bird|publisher=|year=1845|isbn=|location=|pages=3}}</ref> It was a [[Congregational church|Congregational]] institution; its charter was unusually inclusive due to the varied religious backgrounds of its members.

During that first winter, they began a basic school for the children at Campus Martius. In 1797, settlers founded Muskingum Academy. The town had numerous [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]], and Ephraim Cutler was instrumental as a state delegate in 1802 at the state convention in swaying the vote for the state to be free of slavery.<ref name=\"Yeager\">[http://travel.nytimes.com/2009/11/06/travel/escapes/06amer.html?8dpc Robert C.

It was used as a station on the [[Underground Railroad]] to help [[slaves]] escape from the South.<ref name=\"Yeager\" /> [[Ohio University]] was founded earlier in [[Athens, Ohio|Athens]], on land reserved for public education under the Northwest Ordinance.\n\nThe settlers preserved the Great Mound, or ''Conus,'' by planning their own [[Mound Cemetery (Marietta, Ohio)|cemetery]] around it. They also preserved the two largest platform mounds, which they called ''Capitolinus'' and ''Quadrophenus.'' The former was developed as the site for the city library.<ref name=\"OHC\" /> As of 1900, the [[Mound Cemetery (Marietta, Ohio)|Mound Cemetery]] had the highest number of burials of Revolutionary War officers in the nation, indicating the nature of the generation that settled Marietta.<ref>[[Daughters of the American Revolution]] (DAR): ''American Monthly'', Vol. 16, Jan\u2013Jun 1900, New York: R.

Artisans built oceangoing vessels and sailed them downriver to the [[Mississippi river|Mississippi]] and south to New Orleans and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. In less than two decades after settlement, the [[steamboat]] had been developed, and was also constructed here. Brick factories and [[sawmill]]s supplied materials for homes and public buildings. An iron mill, along with several foundries, provided rails for the growing [[railroad]] industry; the Marietta Chair Factory made [[furniture]].\n\n[[File:Marietta Works Squier and Davis Plate XXVI.jpg|thumb|right|upright|1837 Survey of Marietta Earthworks]]\nInterest in the prehistoric culture that built the Marietta Earthworks continued. The complex was surveyed and drawn by [[E. G. Squier|Ephraim George Squier]] and [[Edwin Hamilton Davis]], whose large project on numerous prehistoric mounds throughout the Ohio and Mississippi valleys was published by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1848 as ''[[Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley]].'' It was the first book published by the Smithsonian. Their drawing to the right shows the plan of the original complex, which \"included a large square enclosure surrounding four flat-topped pyramidal mounds, another smaller square, and a circular enclosure with a large burial mound at its center.\"<ref name=\"OHC\">[http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2219 \"Marietta Earthworks\"], Ohio History Central, accessed August 20, 2012</ref> The walled, graded path, called by the settlers the ''[[Sacra Via]]'', led from the largest enclosure to the lower river's edge. This pathway was destroyed in 1843 during mid-nineteenth century development.<ref name=\"OHC\" />\n\n===Railroads and oil===\nLocal development began with the [[Belpre and Cincinnati Railroad]] (B&C); it was founded in 1845. It was intended to connect from [[Belpre, Ohio]], the next town downriver, to a planned [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&O) spur to [[Parkersburg, West Virginia|Parkersburg]]. But, for years, the Virginia government did not allow the B&O to construct track south of [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]]. In 1851 developers changed the Ohio state terminus to Marietta and changed the name of the railroad to the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad that year. The right-of-way for an alternate connection to the B&O extended upriver from Marietta to [[Bellaire, Ohio]]. The M&C was bankrupt by 1857, but construction of track continued west to reach [[Cincinnati]]. The first through-train from Cincinnati ran on April 9, 1857. The M&C got out of bankruptcy in 1860.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nIn 1871, the Ohio Valley Railroad was formed and for the next two years built tracks going north for 103 miles. Their home office was in Marietta, with treasurer offices in Pittsburgh. The Ohio Valley railroad was reorganized as the Marietta and Cleveland. The Pennsylvania Railroad in its expansion later purchased the railroad and its right-of-way between Marietta and Bellaire.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nPassengers traveling between Marietta and Parkersburg, Virginia (now West Virginia) had to take a steamboat for the 14 miles between the two towns and transfer. With help from the B&O and the Baltimore City Council, the Union Railroad finally connected Marietta to [[Belpre, Ohio]] in 1860. Later absorbed by the B&O, this section of track is still in operation (2008), with unit coal trains providing most of the traffic.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe planned [[Parkersburg Bridge (CSX)|bridge]] from Parkersburg across the Ohio River to Belpre was finally built 1868\u20131870 by the B&O, as part of its main line from Baltimore to [[St. Louis, Missouri]].<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hh:@field(DOCID+@lit(WV0105)) ''Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, Parkersburg Bridge, Ohio River, Parkersburg, Wood County, WV''], Historic American Engineering Record, accessed August 22, 2012</ref> This cut Marietta off from traffic and trade, although it retained local and Ohio service. In the early 20th century, 24 passenger trains served Marietta each day, most of which ran on the PRR tracks.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n[[William P. Cutler]] was a major figure in the M&C. He also backed the [[Union Railroad (Ohio)|Union Railroad]] and the Marietta, Columbus and Cleveland Railroad, among other local railroads. Cutler served as General Manager and as President of the M&C for many years.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nIn 1860, oil was first drilled in the Marietta region. Oil booms in 1875 and 1910 made investors rich, who constructed numerous lavish houses in town, of which many still stand.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2009/11/06/travel/escapes/06amer.html?hpw |work=The New York Times |title=A Historic River Town Where the West Began |first=Robert C. |last=Yeager |date=November 6, 2009 |accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> The Dawes brothers of Marietta founded the [[Pure Oil Company]].{{when|date=March 2017}} All four brothers became nationally prominent businessmen and/or politicians: [[Charles Gates Dawes]], [[Rufus C.

Charles Dawes was elected in 1924 with President [[Calvin Coolidge]] to serve as the 30th [[Vice President of the United States]] (1925\u20131929). In 1925, he shared the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], based on his work on the [[Dawes Plan]] and relieving an international crisis in 1923 related to German reparations after [[World War I]].\n\nIn 1880, the first [[Putnam Street Bridge]] was opened to connect Marietta to Fort Harmar. It provided the first free crossing of the [[Muskingum River]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===20th century===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nAs transportation advanced along railroads and highways, Marietta was initially passed by. From 1868\u20131870, the [[B & O Railroad]] built a bridge to connect [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]] and Belpre; and the [[National Road]] went further north through [[Zanesville, Ohio|Zanesville]].\n\nBut, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] expanded in the late 19th century and had a station in Marietta, running 26 daily trains between Marietta and [[Pittsburgh]]. After WWII passenger service decreased as the railroads restructured and the federal government invested in highway construction. The last rail passenger service ended in 1953. Marietta was relatively isolated from new travel routes until 1967, when [[I-77]] was opened with close access to the city.\n\nBefore the United States entered the Great War, a group of 23 young men went from Marietta College to serve in France in 1917 as an ambulance unit; four died in battle. In 1937\u20131938, during the US celebration of the Northwest Territory, France gave a plaque to the city of Marietta, which was installed on the French monument, to commemorate these young men and their service. (See photo at right.)\n\nIn 1939, the [[Sons and Daughters of Pioneer Rivermen]] was established in Marietta during the [[Great Depression]] to celebrate the city's substantial river history and its people. Two years later the [[Ohio River Museum]] was opened. In 1972, the museum campus was totally redesigned.\n\n==Economy==\n{{expand section|date=March 2017}}\nMarietta is home of the longest-running [[ferromanganese]] refinery in North America, [[Eramet]] Marietta Industries Inc., the only ferromanganese refinery in the United States until recently, and leader in [[Manganese]] emissions.<ref name=residents>Haynes EN, Heckel P, Ryan P, Roda S, et al.

The Festival includes performances from musical artists, Sternwheel races, and a large fireworks display; it attracts thousands of visitors from across the country.\n* The [[Riverfront Roar]] powerboat races are held annually in July. The event includes Formula 2 and Formula 3 powerboat racing along the Ohio River.\n* Marietta Civil War Reenactment is also held at the end of September. It includes Union and Confederate reenactors battling across the scenic Muskingum River.\n* Goodfest is held at Goodfellows Park; this local music festival for teenagers features local musicians in a drug & alcohol-free environment.\n* A number of rowing regattas are held throughout the spring. Chief among them Marietta High School's Ralph Lindamood Memorial Regatta and the Marietta Invitational Regatta hosted by Marietta College, which brings some of the nation's fastest college rowing programs to the Muskingum River. In the fall season, the \"Head of the Muskingum\" head race is held, again drawing rowing teams from across the country. The race is run over a 3\u20133.5 mile course starting in [[Devola, Ohio]] and ending at Marietta College's Lindamood-Van Voorhis Boathouse.\n* The 2016 Ohio State of the State address was held at People's Bank Theater on April 6.

This elite unit brings to bear all their talents, intellect, and technical expertise on major cases in order to keep New York and the country safe. Born into a multi-generational law enforcement family, Special Agent Maggie Bell commits deeply to the people she works with as well as those she protects. Her partner is Special Agent Omar Adom \"O.{{nbsp}}A.\" Zidan, a West Point graduate from Bushwick who spent two years undercover for the DEA before being cherry-picked by the FBI. Overseeing them is Special Agent in Charge Dana Mosier, who operates under intense pressure and has undeniable command authority. The team also includes Assistant Special Agent in Charge Jubal Valentine, the nerve center of the office whose ability to easily relate to and engage with both superiors and subordinates makes him a master motivator. Kristen Chazal is the team's most valued resource, a brilliant analyst recruited straight out of college who can piece together the big picture faster than anyone.

This elite unit brings to bear all their talents, intellect, and technical expertise on major cases in order to keep New York and the country safe. Born into a multi-generational law enforcement family, Special Agent Maggie Bell commits deeply to the people she works with as well as those she protects. Her partner is Special Agent Omar Adom \"O.{{nbsp}}A.\" Zidan, a West Point graduate from Bushwick who spent two years undercover for the DEA before being cherry-picked by the FBI. Overseeing them is Special Agent in Charge Dana Mosier, who operates under intense pressure and has undeniable command authority. The team also includes Assistant Special Agent in Charge Jubal Valentine, the nerve center of the office whose ability to easily relate to and engage with both superiors and subordinates makes him a master motivator. Kristen Chazal is the team's most valued resource, a brilliant analyst recruited straight out of college who can piece together the big picture faster than anyone.

series titled ''[[FBI: Most Wanted]]'', with the episode to air in the latter part of the first season. The series will focus on the division of the FBI tasked with tracking and capturing the most notorious criminals on the FBI's Most Wanted list.\nAccording to [[Dick Wolf]], the spin-off is set to launch a series of interconnected shows similar to Wolf's ''[[Chicago (franchise)|Chicago]]'' and ''[[Law & Order (franchise)|Law & Order]]'' franchises on [[NBC]].<ref>{{cite web

The arm must be medially rotated for the deltoid to have maximum effect.<ref>Radiography of the Upper Extremities: 24 ARRT Category A. CE4RT, 2014. 201. Print.</ref> This makes the deltoid an antagonist muscle of the ''pectoralis major ''and ''[[latissimus dorsi]]'' during arm adduction.\n\nThe anterior fibers assist the ''pectoralis major'' to flex the shoulder. The anterior deltoid also works in tandem with the [[subscapularis]], pecs and lats to internally (medially) rotate the humerus.<ref>{{Exrx|Muscles/DeltoidAnterior}}</ref>\n\nThe lateral fibers perform basic shoulder abduction when the shoulder is internally rotated, and perform shoulder transverse abduction when the shoulder is externally rotated. They are not utilized significantly during strict transverse extension (shoulder internally rotated) such as in rowing movements, which use the posterior fibers.<ref>{{Exrx|Muscles/DeltoidLateral}}</ref>\n\nThe posterior fibers assist the ''[[latissimus dorsi]]'' to extend the shoulder.

{"title_page": "Manga iconography", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=November 2008}}\n[[File:Manga Example.png|thumb|right|A page from the ''[[Marmalade Boy]]'' manga, volume 1 (Japanese version)]]\n{{Anime and manga}}\n\nJapanese [[manga]] has developed its own visual language or [[iconography]] for expressing emotion and other internal character states. This drawing style has also migrated into [[anime]], as many manga stories are adapted into television shows and films. While this article addresses styles from both types of output, the emphasis here is on the manga origins for these styles.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mangakakalots.com/|title=Mangakaklots-Read Manga Online |publisher=Manga Kakalots|accessdate=2015-06-19}}</ref>\n\nThe popular and recognizable style of manga is very distinctive. Emphasis is often placed on line over form, and the storytelling and panel placement differ from those in American comics. Impressionistic backgrounds are very common, as are sequences in which the panel shows details of the setting rather than the characters. Panels and pages are typically read from right to left, consistent with traditional [[Japanese language#Writing system|Japanese writing]].\n\nBecause manga is a diverse art form, however, not all manga artists adhere to the conventions most popularized in the West through series such as ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'', ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', ''[[Dragon Ball (manga)|Dragon Ball]]'', and ''[[Ranma \u00bd]]''.\n\n==Panel characteristics==\n\nThere are several expressive techniques typical (and some of them unique) to the manga art form:\n\n*'''[[Screentone]]:''' Transparent adhesive sheets manufactured with a distinctive pattern (typically, some form of dots or hatching, but also including a variety of flashy effects like stars or explosions, or commonplace scenes such as cityscapes, schoolyards, and natural landscapes), these are cut out and overlapped on the panel to introduce shading and detail that would be time-consuming or unfeasible to draw by hand. Increasingly, physical tone sheets are being replaced by computer-generated equivalents.\n*'''Expressive dialogue bubbles:''' The borders of the [[Speech balloon|speech/thought bubbles]] change in pattern/style to reflect the tone and mood of the dialogue. For example, an explosion-shaped bubble for an angry exclamation. Also, manga does not usually follow the normal Western comic conventions for speech (solid arc extending from the character's head) and thought bubble (several small circles used in place of the arc). The latter bubble style is often used for whispered dialogue in manga, which can confuse Western readers.\n*'''[[Speed line]]s:''' Often in action sequences, the background will possess an overlay of neatly ruled lines to portray direction of movements. Speed lines can also be applied to characters as a way to emphasise the motion of their bodies (limbs in particular). This style, especially background blurs, extends into most action based anime as well.\n*'''Mini flashbacks:''' Many artists employ copies of segments from earlier chapters (sometimes only a single panel) and edit them into the story panels to act as a flashback (also applying an overlay of darker tone to differentiate it from current events). This can be considered a convenient method to evoke prior event(s) along with visual imagery. In situations where a character's life events flash across his/her mind, a splash page may be used with the entire background consisting of segments from earlier chapters.\n*'''Abstract background effects:''' These involve elaborate hatching patterns in the background and serve to indicate or strengthen the mood of the plot. It can also illustrate a character's state of mind.\n\n==Facial features==\nWhile the art can be incredibly realistic or cartoonish, characters often have large eyes (female characters usually have larger eyes than male characters), small noses, tiny mouths, and flat faces. Psychological and social research on [[Neoteny|facial attractiveness]] has pointed out that the presence of childlike facial features increases [[Physical attractiveness|attractiveness]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-regensburg.de/Fakultaeten/phil_Fak_II/Psychologie/Psy_II/beautycheck/english/kindchenschema/kindchenschema.htm|title=Babyfaceness|date=2002-07-15|publisher=www.beautycheck.de and Universit\u00e4t Regensburg|accessdate=2008-10-15}}</ref> Manga artists often play on this to increase the appeal of protagonists. Large eyes have become a permanent fixture in manga and anime since the 1960s when [[Osamu Tezuka]] was inspired by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] cartoons from the [[United States]] and started drawing them in this way.\n\nFurthermore, inside the big eyes, the transparent feeling of pupils and the glares, or [[Purkinje images|small reflections]] in the corners of the eyes are often exaggerated, regardless of surrounding lighting, although they are only present in living characters: the eyes of characters who have died are the colour of the iris, but darker. Sometimes this death effect is also used to indicate characters who are emotionless due to trauma or loss of conscious control because of [[spirit possession|possession]] ([[ghost]], [[demon]], [[zombie]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], etc.). In characters with hair partially covering the face, the eyes that would otherwise be covered are often outlined to make them visible, even when the hair is particularly dense and dark.\n\nCertain visual symbols have been developed over the years to become common methods of denoting emotions, physical conditions and mood:\n\n===Eyes===\nEye shape and size can be exaggerated or changed altogether. Love-hearts and doe-eyes indicate an [[infatuation]], while stars indicate that the character is star-struck. Spirals indicate confusion or dizziness, while [[flame]]s or wide empty semicircles indicate that the character is angry or vengeful. When dead, unconscious or stunned, \"X\"s are sometimes used as an indication of the state. Eyes may be replaced with two \"<\"s facing in opposite directions to represent a variety of emotions, such as nervousness or excitement. Eyes without pupils and with reflective glints indicate a state of [[delirium]].\n\nEnlargement of the eyes, where they become huge and perfectly round with tiny pupils and no iris and going beyond the reach of the face (often shown with the mouth becoming like a stretched semicircle, the point of which extends past the chin) symbolises extreme excitement. Similarly, turning eyes into two thick half-circles, conveys a cute, delighted look (see [[#Character design|Character design]] section below).\n\nThe character's eye shapes and sizes are sometimes symbolically used to represent the character. For instance, bigger eyes will usually symbolize beauty, innocence, or purity, while smaller, more narrow eyes typically represent coldness and/or evil. Completely blackened eyes ([[shadow]]ed) indicates a vengeful personality or underlying deep [[anger]]. It could also indicate that someone's being a wise-guy type, particularly when accompanied by grinning. A character's eyes are shadowed regardless of the lighting in the room when they become angry, upset, something is wrong with them, or they are emotionally hurt. Bubbles forming in the corner of a child's or female character's eyes often indicate that the character is about to cry.\n\n===Mouth===\n\nMouths are often depicted as small, usually rendered with one line on the face. A fang peeking from the corner of the mouth indicates mischief or feistiness (unless, of course, the character has fangs normally). A cat mouth (like a number \"3\" rotated 90\u00b0 clockwise) replacing the character's normal mouth, and usually accompanied by larger eyes may also represent mischief or feistiness (a notable exception being [[Konata Izumi]] from ''[[Lucky Star (manga)|Lucky Star]]'', whose usual mouth shape is this).\n\n===Nose===\n\nAgain, noses are often depicted as small, with only a brief L-shaped mark to locate them. With female characters, the nose can sometimes be removed completely when the character is facing forward. In profile, female noses are often button shaped, consisting little more than a small triangle. A [[nosebleed]] indicates sexual excitation following exposure to stimulating imagery or situation. It is based on a Japanese [[old wives' tale]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.skynet.be/mangaguide/au1907.html|title=Tanioka Yasuji|last=Van Huffel|first=Peter|accessdate=2008-09-17}}</ref> A balloon dangling from one nostril (a \"snot bubble\") indicates sleep.\n\n===Head and face===\n\n[[File:Anirage-alternate.svg|right|thumb|Cruciform popping veins above eye on the left and large sweat drop above eye on the right]]\nSweat drops are a common visual convention. Characters are drawn with one or more prominent beads of sweat on their brow or forehead (or floating above the hair on characters whose back is turned). This represents a broad spectrum of emotions, including embarrassment, exasperation, confusion, dismay and shock, not all of which are necessarily considered to be sweat-inducing under normal conditions. Actual physical perspiration in manga is signified by even distribution of sweat drops over the body, occasionally on top of clothing or hair.\n\nThrobbing \"cross popping\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossPoppingVeins |title=Cross-Popping Veins |publisher=TV Tropes |accessdate=2015-06-19}}</ref> veins, usually depicted as a cruciform or [[triskelion]] in the upper head region, indicate [[anger]] or [[irritation]].

This can sometimes be confused with a scribble on the cheek, indicating injury. Sometimes when the character is expressing strong emotions, such as sadness, a long blush through the nose would appear.\n\nFacial shape changes depending on the character's mood, and can look from round apple-shaped to a more subtle carrot shape.\n\nParallel vertical lines with dark shading over the head or under the eye may represent mortification, [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], or horror. If the lines are wavy, they may represent [[disgust]]. A far cuter way to represent frustration/mortification is (mainly for female/young female characters) that they tend to puff out their cheeks while their line is delivered in a gruff voice, an elongated \"3\" showing puffed lips, to emphasize that puffed look.\n\nHair colors of anime characters are not just selected randomly. In some cases they express significant elements of that person's character (based on color symbolism in Japan).\n\n* '''[[Black]]''': Power, [[evil]], [[emptiness]], [[sadness]], mystery, [[sophistication]], completeness, [[death]]\n* '''[[White]]''': Purity, simplicity, [[peace]], [[humility]], [[cold]], [[heaven]] (can also mean [[death]])\n* '''[[Blue]]''': [[Peace]], calm, stability, [[dependability]], [[male]], [[cold]], [[loyalty]].

The most common features include youthfulness as a physical trait (younger age or pigtails) or as an emotional trait such as a naive or innocent outlook, a childlike personality, or some obvious sympathetic weakness the character works hard to correct (extreme clumsiness or a life-threatening disease) but never really succeeds to get rid of.\n\n{{see also|Moe (slang)}}\n\nOther artistic conventions used in mainstream manga include:\n\n*A round swelling, sometimes drawn to the size of baseballs, is a visual exaggeration of swelling from injury.\n*A white cross-shaped bandage symbol denotes pain.

This drawing style has also migrated into [[anime]], as many manga stories are adapted into television shows and films. While this article addresses styles from both types of output, the emphasis here is on the manga origins for these styles.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mangakakalots.com/|title=Mangakaklots-Read Manga Online |publisher=Manga Kakalots|accessdate=2015-06-19}}</ref>\n\nThe popular and recognizable style of manga is very distinctive. Emphasis is often placed on line over form, and the storytelling and panel placement differ from those in American comics. Impressionistic backgrounds are very common, as are sequences in which the panel shows details of the setting rather than the characters. Panels and pages are typically read from right to left, consistent with traditional [[Japanese language#Writing system|Japanese writing]].\n\nBecause manga is a diverse art form, however, not all manga artists adhere to the conventions most popularized in the West through series such as ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'', ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', ''[[Dragon Ball (manga)|Dragon Ball]]'', and ''[[Ranma \u00bd]]''.\n\n==Panel characteristics==\n\nThere are several expressive techniques typical (and some of them unique) to the manga art form:\n\n*'''[[Screentone]]:''' Transparent adhesive sheets manufactured with a distinctive pattern (typically, some form of dots or hatching, but also including a variety of flashy effects like stars or explosions, or commonplace scenes such as cityscapes, schoolyards, and natural landscapes), these are cut out and overlapped on the panel to introduce shading and detail that would be time-consuming or unfeasible to draw by hand. Increasingly, physical tone sheets are being replaced by computer-generated equivalents.\n*'''Expressive dialogue bubbles:''' The borders of the [[Speech balloon|speech/thought bubbles]] change in pattern/style to reflect the tone and mood of the dialogue. For example, an explosion-shaped bubble for an angry exclamation. Also, manga does not usually follow the normal Western comic conventions for speech (solid arc extending from the character's head) and thought bubble (several small circles used in place of the arc). The latter bubble style is often used for whispered dialogue in manga, which can confuse Western readers.\n*'''[[Speed line]]s:''' Often in action sequences, the background will possess an overlay of neatly ruled lines to portray direction of movements. Speed lines can also be applied to characters as a way to emphasise the motion of their bodies (limbs in particular). This style, especially background blurs, extends into most action based anime as well.\n*'''Mini flashbacks:''' Many artists employ copies of segments from earlier chapters (sometimes only a single panel) and edit them into the story panels to act as a flashback (also applying an overlay of darker tone to differentiate it from current events). This can be considered a convenient method to evoke prior event(s) along with visual imagery. In situations where a character's life events flash across his/her mind, a splash page may be used with the entire background consisting of segments from earlier chapters.\n*'''Abstract background effects:''' These involve elaborate hatching patterns in the background and serve to indicate or strengthen the mood of the plot. It can also illustrate a character's state of mind.\n\n==Facial features==\nWhile the art can be incredibly realistic or cartoonish, characters often have large eyes (female characters usually have larger eyes than male characters), small noses, tiny mouths, and flat faces.
