It was inspired by [[Alexa Ray Joel]], his daughter by [[Christie Brinkley]]. The song is in the key of [[G major]].\n\nThe song was originally written as a prelude to the song \"[[The River of Dreams]]\" in the style of a [[Monaural|monophonic]] [[Gregorian chant]]. Joel had written English words in the chant describing a man who had lost his faith, and had then had the words translated into Latin.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PMS9cI_iKs youtube.com]</ref> He changed his mind upon hearing the recording, and incorporated it into the song \"River of Dreams\". He later removed the interlude from the final studio version of \"River of Dreams\", and instead wrote lyrics to the melody that reflected his sentiment toward Alexa Ray, who was a young child at the time of writing. The version of \"River of Dreams\" incorporating \"Lullaby\" appeared as an alternate version on the box set ''[[My Lives]]'', and on ''[[Greatest Hits (Billy Joel albums)|An Evening of Questions and Answers...And A Little Music]].\n\nIn 2004, it was announced that Joel had agreed to write two children's books for Scholastic, the U.S. publisher. The first book was titled ''Goodnight, My Angel (A Lullaby)'' and is a picture book based on the song and illustrated by [[Yvonne Gilbert]]. \"Reassuring children that they are not alone or could be abandoned is very important for their well-being,\" Joel said in a statement in 2004. The second book was titled ''New York State of Mind'' and illustrated by Izak.\n\n== Personnel ==\n*[[Billy Joel]]: lead vocals, [[piano]]\n*Lewis Del Gatto: orchestra manager\n*[[Ira Newborn]]: orchestration\n\n==Cover versions==\n*The German vocal group [[Singer Pur]] interpretes a version of this song in their 2005 CD ''Herzt\u00f6ne - Lovesongs''<ref>http://www.singerpur.de/index.php?lingua=en/</ref>\n*The German [[a cappella]] group [[Wise Guys (band)|Wise Guys]] included a version of this song in their 1997 album ''Alles im gr\u00fcnen Bereich''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiseguys.de/diskographie/details/alles_im_gruenen_bereich/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702085259/http://wiseguys.de/diskographie/details/alles_im_gruenen_bereich/ |archivedate=2017-07-02 }}</ref>\n*The ''[[Gas House Gang (quartet)]]'' included an arrangement of this song by Kirk Young on their 2003 CD \"The Gas House Gang's Fifth\"<ref>[http://www.gashousegang.com/index.php/recordings/the-fifth gashousegang.com]</ref>\n*[[John Stamos]] performed it on the 2006 charity album ''[[Unexpected Dreams|Unexpected Dreams\u2013Songs From the Stars]]''.\n*[[Cantabile - the London Quartet]] arranged this for their album ''Lullabyes and Goodbyes'' - [[Cantabile (group)|Cantabile]]\n*In 2009, the song was also performed by [[Celtic Woman]]<ref>[http://www.wvpt.net/celticwoman2.html Dec 5, 2009 wvpt.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213051716/http://www.wvpt.net/celticwoman2.html |date=2009-12-13 }}</ref>\n*[[Philip Lawson (singer)|Philip Lawson]] arranged this song for [[The King's Singers]].\n*In 2010, it was covered by [[Libera (choir)|Libera]] on their ''[[Peace DeLuxe]]'' album, with Joshua Madine as the soloist.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYNSP8aVj6E ''Lullabye (Goodnight My Angel)''] by Libera (album ''Peace''; video; [[Dorset House School]]).

The song is in the key of [[G major]].\n\nThe song was originally written as a prelude to the song \"[[The River of Dreams]]\" in the style of a [[Monaural|monophonic]] [[Gregorian chant]]. Joel had written English words in the chant describing a man who had lost his faith, and had then had the words translated into Latin.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PMS9cI_iKs youtube.com]</ref> He changed his mind upon hearing the recording, and incorporated it into the song \"River of Dreams\". He later removed the interlude from the final studio version of \"River of Dreams\", and instead wrote lyrics to the melody that reflected his sentiment toward Alexa Ray, who was a young child at the time of writing. The version of \"River of Dreams\" incorporating \"Lullaby\" appeared as an alternate version on the box set ''[[My Lives]]'', and on ''[[Greatest Hits (Billy Joel albums)|An Evening of Questions and Answers...And A Little Music]].\n\nIn 2004, it was announced that Joel had agreed to write two children's books for Scholastic, the U.S. publisher. The first book was titled ''Goodnight, My Angel (A Lullaby)'' and is a picture book based on the song and illustrated by [[Yvonne Gilbert]]. \"Reassuring children that they are not alone or could be abandoned is very important for their well-being,\" Joel said in a statement in 2004.

This machine was the first realized example of a true [[massively parallel]] computer, in which many processors worked together to solve different parts of a single larger problem. In contrast with the vector systems, which were designed to run a single stream of data as quickly as possible, in this concept, the computer instead feeds separate parts of the data to entirely different processors and then recombines the results. The ILLIAC's design was finalized in 1966 with 256 processors and offer speed up to 1 GFLOPS, compared to the 1970s Cray-1's peak of 250 MFLOPS. However, development problems led to only 64 processors being built, and the system could never operate faster than about 200 MFLOPS while being much larger and more complex than the Cray. Another problem was that writing software for the system was difficult, and getting peak performance from it was a matter of serious effort.\n\nBut the partial success of the ILLIAC IV was widely seen as pointing the way to the future of supercomputing. Cray argued against this, famously quipping that \"If you were plowing a field, which would you rather use? Two strong oxen or 1024 chickens?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/seymour_cray_103779|title=Seymour Cray Quotes|website=BrainyQuote}}</ref> But by the early 1980s, several teams were working on parallel designs with thousands of processors, notably the [[Connection Machine]] (CM) that developed from research at [[MIT]].

Similar designs using custom hardware were made by many companies, including the [[Evans & Sutherland ES-1]], [[MasPar]], [[nCUBE]], [[Intel iPSC]] and the [[Goodyear MPP]]. But by the mid-1990s, general-purpose CPU performance had improved so much in that a supercomputer could be built using them as the individual processing units, instead of using custom chips. By the turn of the 21st century, designs featuring tens of thousands of commodity CPUs were the norm, with later machines adding [[GPGPU|graphic units]] to the mix.<ref name=\"Hoffman\"/><ref name=\"Jouppi\"/>\n\n[[File:Processor families in TOP500 supercomputers.svg|thumb|right|The CPU share of [[TOP500]]]]\n[[File:2x2x2torus.svg|thumb|Diagram of a three-dimensional [[torus interconnect]] used by systems such as Blue Gene, Cray XT3, etc.]]\nSystems with a massive number of processors generally take one of two paths.

Software tools for distributed processing include standard [[Application programming interface|APIs]] such as [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]] and [[Parallel Virtual Machine|PVM]], [[Virtual tape library|VTL]], and [[Open-source software|open source]]-based software solutions such as [[Beowulf (computing)|Beowulf]].\n\nIn the most common scenario, environments such as [[Parallel Virtual Machine|PVM]] and [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]] for loosely connected clusters and [[OpenMP]] for tightly coordinated shared memory machines are used.

This machine was the first realized example of a true [[massively parallel]] computer, in which many processors worked together to solve different parts of a single larger problem. In contrast with the vector systems, which were designed to run a single stream of data as quickly as possible, in this concept, the computer instead feeds separate parts of the data to entirely different processors and then recombines the results. The ILLIAC's design was finalized in 1966 with 256 processors and offer speed up to 1 GFLOPS, compared to the 1970s Cray-1's peak of 250 MFLOPS. However, development problems led to only 64 processors being built, and the system could never operate faster than about 200 MFLOPS while being much larger and more complex than the Cray. Another problem was that writing software for the system was difficult, and getting peak performance from it was a matter of serious effort.\n\nBut the partial success of the ILLIAC IV was widely seen as pointing the way to the future of supercomputing. Cray argued against this, famously quipping that \"If you were plowing a field, which would you rather use? Two strong oxen or 1024 chickens?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/seymour_cray_103779|title=Seymour Cray Quotes|website=BrainyQuote}}</ref> But by the early 1980s, several teams were working on parallel designs with thousands of processors, notably the [[Connection Machine]] (CM) that developed from research at [[MIT]].

After serving briefly as commandant of students at the [[Danville Military Academy]] in [[Danville, Virginia]], Marshall received his commission as a second lieutenant of Infantry in February, 1902. In the years after the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], he served in the United States and overseas in positions of increasing rank and responsibility, including platoon leader and company commander in the Philippines during the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. He was the Honor Graduate of his Infantry-Cavalry School Course in 1907, and graduated first in his 1908 [[United States Army Command and General Staff College|Army Staff College]] class.  In 1916 Marshall was assigned as [[aide-de-camp]] to [[J. Franklin Bell]], the commander of the [[Department of the West|Western Department]]. After the United States entered [[World War I]], Marshall served with Bell while Bell commanded the [[Department of the East]]. He was assigned to the staff of the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Division]], and assisted with the organization's mobilization and training in the United States, as well as planning of its combat operations in France. Subsequently, assigned to the staff of the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] headquarters, he was a key planner of American operations including the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]].\n\nAfter the war, Marshall became an [[aide-de-camp]] to [[John J. Pershing]], who was then the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army's Chief of Staff]]. Marshall later served on the Army staff, commanded the [[15th Infantry Regiment (United States)|15th Infantry Regiment]] in China, and was an instructor at the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]]. In 1927, he became assistant commandant of the Army's [[United States Army Infantry School|Infantry School]], where he modernized command and staff processes, which proved to be of major benefit during [[World War II]]. In 1932 and 1933 he commanded the [[8th Infantry Regiment (United States)|8th Infantry Regiment]] and [[Tybee Island, Georgia|Fort Screven]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  Marshall commanded 5th Brigade, [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] and [[Vancouver Barracks]] from 1936 to 1938, and received promotion to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]]. During this command, Marshall was also responsible for 35 [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) camps in Oregon and southern Washington. In July 1938, Marshall was assigned to the War Plans Division on the War Department staff, and later became the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff. When Chief of Staff [[Malin Craig]] retired in 1939, Marshall became acting Chief of Staff, and then Chief of Staff, a position he held until the war's end in 1945.\n\nAs Chief of Staff, Marshall organized the largest military expansion in U.S. history, and received promotion to [[five-star rank]] as [[General of the Army (United States)#World War II era|General of the Army]]. Marshall coordinated Allied operations in Europe and the Pacific until the end of the war. In addition to accolades from Churchill and other Allied leaders, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Marshall its [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Man of the Year]] for 1943.

In addition to obtaining a long-sought and significant troop command, traditionally viewed as an indispensable step to the pinnacle of the US Army, Marshall was also responsible for 35 [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) camps in Oregon and southern Washington. As post commander Marshall made a concerted effort to cultivate relations with the city of Portland and to enhance the image of the US Army in the region. With the CCC, he initiated a series of measures to improve the morale of the participants and to make the experience beneficial in their later life. He started a newspaper for the CCC region that proved a vehicle to promote CCC successes, and he initiated a variety of programs that developed their skills and improved their health. Marshall's inspections of the CCC camps gave him and his wife Katherine the chance to enjoy the beauty of the American northwest and made that assignment what he called \"the most instructive service I ever had, and the most interesting.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgecmarshall.org|title=Home|website=www.georgecmarshall.org|access-date=2016-07-04}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1938, Marshall was assigned to the War Plans Division in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] and subsequently reassigned as Deputy Chief of Staff. In that capacity, then-Brigadier General Marshall attended a conference at the White House at which [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] proposed a plan to provide aircraft to England in support of the war effort, lacking forethought with regard to logistical support or training. With all other attendees voicing support of the plan, Marshall was the only person to voice his disagreement.

He was instrumental in advancing the careers of the highly capable generals such as Eisenhower, Bradley, Patton, Krueger and Clark.  A notable exception was his recommendation of the swaggering Fredendall to Eisenhower for a major command in the American invasion of North Africa during Operation Torch. Marshall was especially fond of Fredendall, describing him as \"one of the best\" and remarking in a staff meeting when his name was mentioned, \"I like that man; you can see determination all over his face.\"  Eisenhower duly picked him to command the 39,000-man Central Task Force (the largest of three) in Operation Torch.

Marshall wrote the document that would become the central strategy for all Allied operations in Europe. He initially scheduled [[Operation Overlord]] for April 1, 1943, but met with strong opposition from Winston Churchill, who convinced Roosevelt to commit troops to [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] for the invasion of Italy. Some authors think that World War II could have ended earlier if Marshall had had his way; others think that such an invasion would have meant utter failure.\n\nIt was assumed that Marshall would become the Supreme Commander of Operation Overlord, but Roosevelt selected Eisenhower as Supreme Commander. While Marshall enjoyed considerable success in working with Congress and Roosevelt, he refused to lobby for the position. President Roosevelt didn't want to lose his presence in the States.

He was characterized as the organizer of Allied victory by Winston Churchill. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Marshall [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Man of the Year]] for 1943.

It amassed 25,000 pages of documents, 40 volumes, and included nine reports and investigations, eight of which had been previously completed. These reports included criticism of Marshall for delay in sending General [[Walter Short]], the Army commander in Hawaii, important information obtained from intercepted Japanese diplomatic messages. The report also criticized Marshall's lack of knowledge of the readiness of the Hawaiian Command during November and December 1941. Ten days after the attack, Lt. General Short and Admiral [[Husband E. Kimmel]], commander of the Navy at Pearl Harbor, were both relieved of their duties. The final report of the Joint Committee did not single out or fault Marshall.

Marshall.jpg|thumb|Secretary of Defense George C. Marshall sits for a portrait in 1950.]]\nWhen the early months of the [[Korean War]] showed how poorly prepared the Defense Department was, President Truman fired Secretary [[Louis A. Johnson]] and named Marshall as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] in September 1950.  The appointment required a congressional waiver because the [[National Security Act of 1947]] prohibited a uniformed military officer from serving in the post.  This prohibition included Marshall since individuals promoted to General of the Army are not technically retired, but remain officially on active duty even after their active service has concluded. Marshall was the first person to be granted such a waiver; in 2017, [[Jim Mattis]] became the second. Marshall's main role as Secretary of Defense was to restore confidence and morale to the Defense Department while rebuilding the armed forces following their post-World War II demobilization.\n\n===Korean War===\n[[File:Thomas Edgar Stephens - George C. Marshall - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|George Marshall portrait by [[Thomas E. Stephens]] (c. 1949)]]\nMarshall worked to provide more manpower to meet the demands of both the Korean War and the [[Cold War]] in Europe. To implement his priorities Marshall brought in a new leadership team, including [[Robert A. Lovett]] as his deputy and [[Anna M. Rosenberg]], former head of the [[War Manpower Commission]], as assistant secretary of defense for manpower. He also worked to rebuild the relationship between the Defense and State Departments, as well as the relationship between the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nMarshall participated in the post-[[Battle of Inchon|Inchon landing]] discussion that led to authorizing [[Douglas MacArthur]] to conduct operations in North Korea.  A secret \"eyes only\" signal from Marshall to MacArthur on September 29, 1950 declared the Truman administration's commitment: \"We want you to feel unhampered strategically and tactically to proceed north of the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The American Culture of War: The History of US Military Force from World War II to Operation Enduring Freedon|last=Lewis|first=Adrian|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0415890199|location=|page=104}}</ref> At the same time, Marshall advised against public pronouncements which might lead to [[United Nations]] votes undermining or countermanding the initial mandate to restore the border between North and South Korea. Marshall and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were generally supportive of MacArthur because they were of the view that field commanders should be able to exercise their best judgment in accomplishing the intent of their superiors.\n\nFollowing Chinese military intervention in Korea during late November, Marshall and the Joint Chiefs of Staff sought ways to aid MacArthur while avoiding all-out war with China. In the debate over what to do about China's increased involvement, Marshall opposed a cease\u2013fire on the grounds that it would make the U.S. look weak in China's eyes, leading to demands for future concessions. In addition, Marshall argued that the U.S. had a moral obligation to honor its commitment to South Korea. When British Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] suggested diplomatic overtures to China, Marshall opposed, arguing that it was impossible to negotiate with the Communist government. In addition, Marshall expressed concern that concessions to China would undermine confidence in the U.S. among its Asian allies, including Japan and the Philippines.  When some in Congress favored expanding the war in Korea and confronting China, Marshall argued against a wider war in Korea, continuing instead to stress the importance of containing the Soviet Union during the Cold War battle for primacy in Europe.\n\n====Relief of General MacArthur====\n{{main|Relief of Douglas MacArthur}}\nIncreasingly concerned about public statements from MacArthur, commander of United Nations forces fighting in the Korean War, which contradicted President Truman's on prosecution of the war, on the morning of 6 April 1951, Truman held a meeting with Marshall, [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] Omar Bradley, Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] and advisor [[W. Averell Harriman]] to discuss whether MacArthur should be removed from command.\n\nHarriman was emphatically in favor of MacArthur's relief, but Bradley opposed it. Marshall asked for more time to consider the matter. Acheson was in favor but did not disclose this, instead warning Truman that if he did it, MacArthur's relief would cause \"the biggest fight of your administration.\" At another meeting the following day, Marshall and Bradley continued to oppose MacArthur's relief. On 8 April, the Joint Chiefs of Staff met with Marshall, and each expressed the view that MacArthur's relief was desirable from a \"military point of view,\" suggesting that \"if MacArthur were not relieved, a large segment of our people would charge that civil authorities no longer controlled the military.\"\n\nMarshall, Bradley, Acheson and Harriman met with Truman again on 9 April. Bradley informed the President of the views of the Joint Chiefs, and Marshall added that he agreed with them. Truman wrote in his diary that \"it is of unanimous opinion of all that MacArthur be relieved. All four so advise.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.trumanlibrary.org/exhibit_documents/index.php?pagenumber=2&titleid=188&tldate=1951-04-06&collectionid=firem&PageID=1&groupid=3416 | accessdate = 5 June 2011 | title = Diary entries, 6\u20137, April 1951, Truman Papers. | publisher = Harry S. Truman Library and Museum}}</ref> (The Joint Chiefs would later insist that they had only \"concurred\" with the relief, not \"recommended\" it.)\n\nOn April 11, 1951, President Truman directed transmittal of an order to MacArthur, issued over Bradley's signature, relieving MacArthur of his assignment in Korea and directing him to turn over command to [[Matthew Ridgway]]. In line with Marshall's view, and those of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, MacArthur's relief was looked upon by proponents as being necessary to reassert the tenet of [[civilian control of the military]].\n\n==Later life==\nMarshall retired in September 1951 to his home, [[George C. Marshall's Dodona Manor|Dodona Manor]], in [[Leesburg, Virginia]] to tend to his gardens and continue his passion for horseback riding. He was head of the American delegation at [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|the coronation]] of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953.  He also served as Chairman of the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]] from 1949 to 1959.\n\n==Death and burial==\n[[File:George Marshall Gravesite.jpg|thumb|Grave site of George Marshall at Arlington National Cemetery]]\nMarshall died at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center|Walter Reed Hospital]] in Washington, D.C. on October 16, 1959 at the age of 78. Although he was entitled to an Official Funeral, Marshall preferred simplicity, so received a Special Military Funeral after lying in state at the [[Washington National Cathedral]] for 21 hours, guarded by representatives from all the U.S. armed services, as well as a VMI cadet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history.army.mil/books/Last_Salute/Ch19.htm|title=Chapter 19 - The Last Salute|website=history.army.mil}}</ref> President Eisenhower ordered flags flown at half-mast, and was among the invited guests at the funeral service at the [[Fort Myer]] Old Post Chapel; other dignitaries included former President Truman,  Secretary of State [[Christian Herter|Christian A. Herter]], former Secretary of State Dean G. Acheson, W. Averell Harriman and Generals Omar N. Bradley, [[Alfred M. Gruenther]] and General [[Matthew B. Ridgway]]. His parish priest, Rev. Franklin Moss Jr. from St. James Episcopal Church  in Leesburg, Virginia conducted the chapel and graveside services, assisted by former chief chaplain and National Cathedral Canon Rev. Luther Miller. Following a 19-gun salute, Marshall was buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], in a place he had picked, in Section 7, Grave 8198, beside his first wife, Elizabeth Carter Coles (1875\u20131927) and her mother, Elizabeth Pendleton Coles (1849\u20131929); his second wife, Katherine Tupper Brown Marshall (1882\u20131978) would later join them.\n\n==Reputation and legacy==\nMarshall's reputation for excellence as a military organizer and planner was recognized early in his career, and became known throughout the Army.  In a performance appraisal prepared while Marshall was a lieutenant in the Philippines, his superior, Captain E. J. Williams responded to the routine question of whether he would want the evaluated officer to serve under his command again by writing of Marshall \"Should the exigencies of active service place him in exalted command I would be glad to serve ''under him''.\" (Emphasis added.)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marshallfoundation.org/library/digital-archive/editorial-note-on-becoming-general-liggettos-aide/ |title=1-070, Editorial Note on Becoming General Liggett's Aide, February 1915 |website=marshallfoundation.org |publisher=George C. Marshall Foundation |access-date=July 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, Lieutenant Colonel [[Johnson Hagood (general)|Johnson Hagood]] completed a written evaluation of Marshall's performance in which he called Marshall a military genius. Responding to the question of whether he would want his subordinate Marshall to serve under him again, Hagood wrote \"Yes, but I would prefer to serve ''under his command''.\" (Emphasis added.)<ref>{{cite book |last=Puryear |first=Edgar F.

In recent years, the cooperation required between former European adversaries as part of the Marshall Plan has been recognized as one of the earliest factors that led to formation of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], and eventually the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marshallfoundation.org/marshall/the-marshall-plan/history-marshall-plan/ |title=History of the Marshall Plan |website=marshallfoundation.org |publisher=George C.

Truman]] was asked which American he thought had made the greatest contribution of the preceding thirty years.

After serving briefly as commandant of students at the [[Danville Military Academy]] in [[Danville, Virginia]], Marshall received his commission as a second lieutenant of Infantry in February, 1902. In the years after the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], he served in the United States and overseas in positions of increasing rank and responsibility, including platoon leader and company commander in the Philippines during the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. He was the Honor Graduate of his Infantry-Cavalry School Course in 1907, and graduated first in his 1908 [[United States Army Command and General Staff College|Army Staff College]] class.  In 1916 Marshall was assigned as [[aide-de-camp]] to [[J. Franklin Bell]], the commander of the [[Department of the West|Western Department]]. After the United States entered [[World War I]], Marshall served with Bell while Bell commanded the [[Department of the East]]. He was assigned to the staff of the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Division]], and assisted with the organization's mobilization and training in the United States, as well as planning of its combat operations in France. Subsequently, assigned to the staff of the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] headquarters, he was a key planner of American operations including the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]].\n\nAfter the war, Marshall became an [[aide-de-camp]] to [[John J. Pershing]], who was then the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army's Chief of Staff]]. Marshall later served on the Army staff, commanded the [[15th Infantry Regiment (United States)|15th Infantry Regiment]] in China, and was an instructor at the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]]. In 1927, he became assistant commandant of the Army's [[United States Army Infantry School|Infantry School]], where he modernized command and staff processes, which proved to be of major benefit during [[World War II]]. In 1932 and 1933 he commanded the [[8th Infantry Regiment (United States)|8th Infantry Regiment]] and [[Tybee Island, Georgia|Fort Screven]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  Marshall commanded 5th Brigade, [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] and [[Vancouver Barracks]] from 1936 to 1938, and received promotion to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]]. During this command, Marshall was also responsible for 35 [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) camps in Oregon and southern Washington. In July 1938, Marshall was assigned to the War Plans Division on the War Department staff, and later became the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff. When Chief of Staff [[Malin Craig]] retired in 1939, Marshall became acting Chief of Staff, and then Chief of Staff, a position he held until the war's end in 1945.\n\nAs Chief of Staff, Marshall organized the largest military expansion in U.S. history, and received promotion to [[five-star rank]] as [[General of the Army (United States)#World War II era|General of the Army]]. Marshall coordinated Allied operations in Europe and the Pacific until the end of the war. In addition to accolades from Churchill and other Allied leaders, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Marshall its [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Man of the Year]] for 1943.

Marshall's inspections of the CCC camps gave him and his wife Katherine the chance to enjoy the beauty of the American northwest and made that assignment what he called \"the most instructive service I ever had, and the most interesting.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgecmarshall.org|title=Home|website=www.georgecmarshall.org|access-date=2016-07-04}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1938, Marshall was assigned to the War Plans Division in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] and subsequently reassigned as Deputy Chief of Staff. In that capacity, then-Brigadier General Marshall attended a conference at the White House at which [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] proposed a plan to provide aircraft to England in support of the war effort, lacking forethought with regard to logistical support or training. With all other attendees voicing support of the plan, Marshall was the only person to voice his disagreement. Marshall also spoke in favor of a large ground army although Roosevelt had said a large air force would be a greater deterrent to enemies than a large army.{{sfn|Roberts|2009|p=26}} Despite others' belief then that he had ended his career, this action resulted in his being nominated by Roosevelt to be the Army Chief of Staff as his personal choice. Marshall was then only 34th in seniority and outranked by 21 major-generals and 11 brigadier-generals; but he was the fifth-ranking officer under an unwritten rule that the chief of staff should be able to serve a four-year term before reaching 64.{{sfn|Roberts|2009|p=27}} \n\nUpon the retirement of General [[Malin Craig]] on July 1, 1939, Marshall became acting chief of staff. Marshall was promoted to [[General (United States)|general]] and sworn in as chief of staff on September 1, 1939, the same day the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] launched its [[invasion of Poland]].<ref>[http://www.georgecmarshall.org/Meet-General-Marshall/Early-Career George C.

Marshall saw Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]] and they went to see Roosevelt together; Marshall emphasized the supreme importance of getting the full amount and told Roosevelt \"you have got to do something and you\u2019ve got to do it today\".

Though he had never actually led troops in combat, Marshall was a skilled organizer with a talent for inspiring other officers.<ref>Bland, Larry I., ''George C.

He was instrumental in advancing the careers of the highly capable generals such as Eisenhower, Bradley, Patton, Krueger and Clark.  A notable exception was his recommendation of the swaggering Fredendall to Eisenhower for a major command in the American invasion of North Africa during Operation Torch. Marshall was especially fond of Fredendall, describing him as \"one of the best\" and remarking in a staff meeting when his name was mentioned, \"I like that man; you can see determination all over his face.\"  Eisenhower duly picked him to command the 39,000-man Central Task Force (the largest of three) in Operation Torch. Both men would come to regret that decision, as Fredendall was the leader of U.S. Army forces at the disastrous Battle of the Kasserine Pass.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Planned invasion of Europe===\n[[File:Infantry in battle cover.gif|thumb|Cover to the book ''Infantry in Battle'', the World War II officer's guide to infantry combat operations. Marshall directed production of the book, which is still used as a reference today.]]\nDuring World War II, Marshall was instrumental in preparing the U.S. Army and [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] for the invasion of the European continent. Marshall wrote the document that would become the central strategy for all Allied operations in Europe. He initially scheduled [[Operation Overlord]] for April 1, 1943, but met with strong opposition from Winston Churchill, who convinced Roosevelt to commit troops to [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] for the invasion of Italy. Some authors think that World War II could have ended earlier if Marshall had had his way; others think that such an invasion would have meant utter failure.\n\nIt was assumed that Marshall would become the Supreme Commander of Operation Overlord, but Roosevelt selected Eisenhower as Supreme Commander. While Marshall enjoyed considerable success in working with Congress and Roosevelt, he refused to lobby for the position. President Roosevelt didn't want to lose his presence in the States. He told Marshall, \"I didn't feel I could sleep at ease if you were out of Washington.\"<ref name=d>{{cite book|last=Buell|first=Thomas B.|author2=John H.

He was the second American to be promoted to a five-star rank, as [[William Daniel Leahy|William Leahy]] was promoted to [[Fleet Admiral (United States)|fleet admiral]] the previous day.\n\nThroughout the remainder of World War II, Marshall coordinated Allied operations in Europe and the Pacific. He was characterized as the organizer of Allied victory by Winston Churchill. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Marshall [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Man of the Year]] for 1943. Marshall resigned his post of chief of staff on November 10, 1945, but did not retire, as regulations stipulate that Generals of the Army remain on active duty for life.  He was succeeded as Army chief of staff by General of the Army [[Dwight Eisenhower]].<ref name=\"wedemeyer\"/>\n\n==Analysis of Pearl Harbor intelligence failure==\nAfter World War II ended, the Congressional Joint Committee on the Investigation of the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor Attack]] received testimony on the intelligence failure. It amassed 25,000 pages of documents, 40 volumes, and included nine reports and investigations, eight of which had been previously completed. These reports included criticism of Marshall for delay in sending General [[Walter Short]], the Army commander in Hawaii, important information obtained from intercepted Japanese diplomatic messages. The report also criticized Marshall's lack of knowledge of the readiness of the Hawaiian Command during November and December 1941. Ten days after the attack, Lt. General Short and Admiral [[Husband E. Kimmel]], commander of the Navy at Pearl Harbor, were both relieved of their duties. The final report of the Joint Committee did not single out or fault Marshall. While the report was critical of the overall situation, the committee noted that subordinates had failed to pass on important information to their superiors, including Marshall.<ref>Hearings before the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack, Congress of the United States, Seventy-Ninth Congress (Washington, D.C.), Part 39, pp. 144\u201345.</ref><ref>Conclusions and Recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack, Congress of the United States, Seventy-Ninth Congress (Washington, D.C.) pp. 252, 265</ref>\n\nA secret report into the Army's role, the [[Clausen Report]] was authorized by Secretary [[Henry L.

Mao promised Marshall the Communists would give up armed revolution, embrace the old enemies, and build a democracy in China. Marshall hoped for a coalition government, and toasted their common future.

Marshall felt that if the state of Israel was declared that a war would break out in the Middle East (which it did in 1948 one day after Israel declared independence). Marshall saw recognizing the Jewish state as a political move to gain Jewish support in the upcoming election, in which Truman was expected to lose to Dewey.

Marshall.jpg|thumb|Secretary of Defense George C. Marshall sits for a portrait in 1950.]]\nWhen the early months of the [[Korean War]] showed how poorly prepared the Defense Department was, President Truman fired Secretary [[Louis A. Johnson]] and named Marshall as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] in September 1950.  The appointment required a congressional waiver because the [[National Security Act of 1947]] prohibited a uniformed military officer from serving in the post.  This prohibition included Marshall since individuals promoted to General of the Army are not technically retired, but remain officially on active duty even after their active service has concluded. Marshall was the first person to be granted such a waiver; in 2017, [[Jim Mattis]] became the second. Marshall's main role as Secretary of Defense was to restore confidence and morale to the Defense Department while rebuilding the armed forces following their post-World War II demobilization.\n\n===Korean War===\n[[File:Thomas Edgar Stephens - George C. Marshall - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|George Marshall portrait by [[Thomas E. Stephens]] (c. 1949)]]\nMarshall worked to provide more manpower to meet the demands of both the Korean War and the [[Cold War]] in Europe. To implement his priorities Marshall brought in a new leadership team, including [[Robert A. Lovett]] as his deputy and [[Anna M. Rosenberg]], former head of the [[War Manpower Commission]], as assistant secretary of defense for manpower. He also worked to rebuild the relationship between the Defense and State Departments, as well as the relationship between the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nMarshall participated in the post-[[Battle of Inchon|Inchon landing]] discussion that led to authorizing [[Douglas MacArthur]] to conduct operations in North Korea.  A secret \"eyes only\" signal from Marshall to MacArthur on September 29, 1950 declared the Truman administration's commitment: \"We want you to feel unhampered strategically and tactically to proceed north of the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The American Culture of War: The History of US Military Force from World War II to Operation Enduring Freedon|last=Lewis|first=Adrian|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0415890199|location=|page=104}}</ref> At the same time, Marshall advised against public pronouncements which might lead to [[United Nations]] votes undermining or countermanding the initial mandate to restore the border between North and South Korea. Marshall and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were generally supportive of MacArthur because they were of the view that field commanders should be able to exercise their best judgment in accomplishing the intent of their superiors.\n\nFollowing Chinese military intervention in Korea during late November, Marshall and the Joint Chiefs of Staff sought ways to aid MacArthur while avoiding all-out war with China. In the debate over what to do about China's increased involvement, Marshall opposed a cease\u2013fire on the grounds that it would make the U.S. look weak in China's eyes, leading to demands for future concessions. In addition, Marshall argued that the U.S. had a moral obligation to honor its commitment to South Korea. When British Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] suggested diplomatic overtures to China, Marshall opposed, arguing that it was impossible to negotiate with the Communist government. In addition, Marshall expressed concern that concessions to China would undermine confidence in the U.S. among its Asian allies, including Japan and the Philippines.  When some in Congress favored expanding the war in Korea and confronting China, Marshall argued against a wider war in Korea, continuing instead to stress the importance of containing the Soviet Union during the Cold War battle for primacy in Europe.\n\n====Relief of General MacArthur====\n{{main|Relief of Douglas MacArthur}}\nIncreasingly concerned about public statements from MacArthur, commander of United Nations forces fighting in the Korean War, which contradicted President Truman's on prosecution of the war, on the morning of 6 April 1951, Truman held a meeting with Marshall, [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] Omar Bradley, Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] and advisor [[W. Averell Harriman]] to discuss whether MacArthur should be removed from command.\n\nHarriman was emphatically in favor of MacArthur's relief, but Bradley opposed it. Marshall asked for more time to consider the matter. Acheson was in favor but did not disclose this, instead warning Truman that if he did it, MacArthur's relief would cause \"the biggest fight of your administration.\" At another meeting the following day, Marshall and Bradley continued to oppose MacArthur's relief. On 8 April, the Joint Chiefs of Staff met with Marshall, and each expressed the view that MacArthur's relief was desirable from a \"military point of view,\" suggesting that \"if MacArthur were not relieved, a large segment of our people would charge that civil authorities no longer controlled the military.\"\n\nMarshall, Bradley, Acheson and Harriman met with Truman again on 9 April. Bradley informed the President of the views of the Joint Chiefs, and Marshall added that he agreed with them. Truman wrote in his diary that \"it is of unanimous opinion of all that MacArthur be relieved. All four so advise.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.trumanlibrary.org/exhibit_documents/index.php?pagenumber=2&titleid=188&tldate=1951-04-06&collectionid=firem&PageID=1&groupid=3416 | accessdate = 5 June 2011 | title = Diary entries, 6\u20137, April 1951, Truman Papers. | publisher = Harry S.

In line with Marshall's view, and those of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, MacArthur's relief was looked upon by proponents as being necessary to reassert the tenet of [[civilian control of the military]].\n\n==Later life==\nMarshall retired in September 1951 to his home, [[George C. Marshall's Dodona Manor|Dodona Manor]], in [[Leesburg, Virginia]] to tend to his gardens and continue his passion for horseback riding. He was head of the American delegation at [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|the coronation]] of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953.  He also served as Chairman of the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]] from 1949 to 1959.\n\n==Death and burial==\n[[File:George Marshall Gravesite.jpg|thumb|Grave site of George Marshall at Arlington National Cemetery]]\nMarshall died at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center|Walter Reed Hospital]] in Washington, D.C. on October 16, 1959 at the age of 78. Although he was entitled to an Official Funeral, Marshall preferred simplicity, so received a Special Military Funeral after lying in state at the [[Washington National Cathedral]] for 21 hours, guarded by representatives from all the U.S. armed services, as well as a VMI cadet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history.army.mil/books/Last_Salute/Ch19.htm|title=Chapter 19 - The Last Salute|website=history.army.mil}}</ref> President Eisenhower ordered flags flown at half-mast, and was among the invited guests at the funeral service at the [[Fort Myer]] Old Post Chapel; other dignitaries included former President Truman,  Secretary of State [[Christian Herter|Christian A.

Franklin Moss Jr. from St. James Episcopal Church  in Leesburg, Virginia conducted the chapel and graveside services, assisted by former chief chaplain and National Cathedral Canon Rev. Luther Miller. Following a 19-gun salute, Marshall was buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], in a place he had picked, in Section 7, Grave 8198, beside his first wife, Elizabeth Carter Coles (1875\u20131927) and her mother, Elizabeth Pendleton Coles (1849\u20131929); his second wife, Katherine Tupper Brown Marshall (1882\u20131978) would later join them.\n\n==Reputation and legacy==\nMarshall's reputation for excellence as a military organizer and planner was recognized early in his career, and became known throughout the Army.  In a performance appraisal prepared while Marshall was a lieutenant in the Philippines, his superior, Captain E. J. Williams responded to the routine question of whether he would want the evaluated officer to serve under his command again by writing of Marshall \"Should the exigencies of active service place him in exalted command I would be glad to serve ''under him''.\" (Emphasis added.)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marshallfoundation.org/library/digital-archive/editorial-note-on-becoming-general-liggettos-aide/ |title=1-070, Editorial Note on Becoming General Liggett's Aide, February 1915 |website=marshallfoundation.org |publisher=George C.

Responding to the question of whether he would want his subordinate Marshall to serve under him again, Hagood wrote \"Yes, but I would prefer to serve ''under his command''.\" (Emphasis added.)<ref>{{cite book |last=Puryear |first=Edgar F.
