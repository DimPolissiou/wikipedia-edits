The latest payTV supplier is K+ which is a joint venture between Vietnam Cable Television (VTVCab) and [[Canal+]], first broadcast in later 2009 via [[Direct To Home]] (DTH), and An Vi\u00ean Television Service, owned by Audio Visual Global JSC, first broadcast in 2011 via both [[DVB-T2]] [[digital terrestrial television]] (DTT) and [[Direct To Home]] (DTH)\n\n==Radio==\n[[File:Vovlogo.png|270x270px|right]]\nThe first [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese-language]] radio transmission was made on September 2, 1945, when [[Ho Chi Minh]] read out the [[Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam]].\n\nPrior to 1945, Vietnamese people were banned from owning radio receivers, and broadcasting was under control of the [[French Indochina|French colonial government]], which established the first radio station in Vietnam, Radio Saigon, in the late 1920s.\n\nVietnam's national radio station, now called the [[Voice of Vietnam]], started broadcasting from Hanoi just a week after the declaration of the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], [[Radio Hanoi]] operated as a propaganda tool of the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Viet Nam]].\n\n[[South Vietnam]] set up its own network in Saigon in 1955.\n\nFollowing [[History of Vietnam#Aftermath of the Vietnam War and Reunification|Reunification]], all of the radio stations were combined into the Voice of Vietnam, which became the national radio station in 1978.\n\nToday, VOV strives to offer diverse, high-quality programming and in every aspect of mass media. It broadcasts on many channels, repeated on [[AM broadcasting|Medium wave (MW) AM]], [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and [[shortwave|shortwave (SW) AM]] bands throughout Vietnam and the rest of the world:\n* VOV1 (MW and SW) - news, current affairs and music\n* VOV2 (MW and SW) - cultural and artistic programs\n* VOV3 (FM) - music & entertainment\n* VOV4 (MW) - [[List of ethnic groups in Vietnam|ethnic minority language]] programming\n* VOV5 (MW) - world service broadcasts in 11 foreign languages\n* VOV Transportation (FM) - updating information during rush hours to help people travel smoothly through traffic jams.\n* VOV English 24/7 (FM) - English-language programs\n* VOV 89 (FM) - health and safety consumering\n* VOV News - a website containing news and other aspects\n* VOVTV( Television Channel)- nationally broadcast which aims at delivering update news every 30 minutes per program\n* VOV newspaper 'the Voice of Vietnam'- a printed version with more in-depth contents of VOVnews website\nAs of 2004, it was estimated that VOV's programs reached more than 90% of all households in Vietnam.\n\nIn addition, most cities and provinces has their own radio stations.\n* *[https://web.archive.org/web/20140201193140/http://www.delicest.com/2013/09/radio-stations-viet-nam-nghe-truc-tuyen.html Vietnam Radio Stations Online Full List Updated 2013 ] Listen all Vietnam AM / FM Radio Stations Online\n\n==Newspapers==\nAs Vietnam moves toward a free-market economy with its [[doi moi]] measures, the government has relied on the print media to keep the public informed about its policies. The measure has had the effect of almost doubling the numbers of newspapers and magazines since 1996.\n\nThe first [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese-language]] newspaper was the French-sponsored ''Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh Bao'', established in Saigon in 1869. In the years that followed, both the nationalistic and the colonial sides relied on newspapers as a propaganda tool. During the final period of French colonialism many reporters were arrested and imprisoned and several newspaper offices closed by the authorities.\n\nFor Ho Chi Minh's revolutionary side, Vietnamese journalists covered the [[First Indochina War]]. After the war, presses were set up in Hanoi and the basis for the country's newspaper industry as it exists today was formed, with the main [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]] organ, ''[[Nhan Dan]]'' (''The People''), established in 1951.\n\nCurrent large Vietnamese-language newspapers include ''[[Tuoi Tre]]'' (''Youth'', published in [[Ho Chi Minh City]], described as a \"reformist\" newspaper), ''[[Thanh Nien]]'' (''Youth''), ''[[Ng\u01b0\u1eddi Lao \u0110\u1ed9ng]]'' (''Labour'' or ''The Worker''), ''[[Tien Phong (newspaper)|Tien Phong]]'' (''Vanguard''), ''[[Sai Gon Giai Phong]]'' (''Liberated Saigon''), and ''[[H\u00e0n\u1ed9im\u1edbi]]'' (''New Hanoi''). Prominent French language newspapers included ''Saigon Eco'', the only that currently is published is ''[[Le Courrier du Vietnam]]''. There are other, smaller provincial newspapers such as the ''[[Ba Ria Vung Tau Daily Newspaper]]''.\n\nThe largest online newspapers are [[Zing.vn]], [[VnExpress]], [[VietNamNet]], [[Tu\u1ed5i Tr\u1ebb]], [[Thanh Ni\u00ean]], [[D\u00e2n Tr\u00ed]], [[Vietnam Multimedia Corporation|VTC News]], and [[Vietnam News Agency|VietnamPlus]].

An [[all-rounder]] who bats right-handed and bowls right-arm [[off break]], Ashwin plays for [[Tamil Nadu cricket team|Tamil Nadu]] in domestic cricket and [[Delhi Capitals]] in the [[Indian Premier League]].

He made his first-class debut for Tamil Nadu in December 2006 and captained the team the following season. But it was not until the [[2010 Indian Premier League]] in which he played for the [[Chennai Super Kings]], that he came into the limelight with his economical bowling and earned his maiden international call-up in the limited-overs formats in June 2010. He was the leading wicket-taker and player of the tournament of the [[2010 Champions League Twenty20]] in South Africa. He was also part of the Indian squad that won the [[2011 Cricket World Cup]]. Later that year, he made his Test debut against West Indies and became the seventh Indian to [[List of India cricketers who have taken five-wicket hauls on Test debut|take a five-wicket haul]] on Test debut. He took two five-wicket hauls and scored a century in that series and won the player of the series award.\n\nAshwin continued to succeed in the subcontinent but proved to be less effective in other places like Australia and England. In a home Test series against Australia in 2013, he took 29 wickets, the most by any Indian bowler in a four-match Test series. The same year, he took his 100th Test wicket in his 18th match, becoming the fastest Indian bowler to the milestone and the fastest in the world in over 80 years.

An [[all-rounder]] who bats right-handed and bowls right-arm [[off break]], Ashwin plays for [[Tamil Nadu cricket team|Tamil Nadu]] in domestic cricket and [[Delhi Capitals]] in the [[Indian Premier League]]. He is the fastest Indian bowler (also in some records the joint fastest in the world) to reach the 50-, 100-, 150-, 200-, 250-, 300- and 350-wicket mark in [[Test cricket]] in terms of number of innings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Records / Test matches / Bowling records / Fastest to 50. wickets|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/india/content/records/283528.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=2 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"200 wickets\">{{cite web|title=R Ashwin second-fastest to 200 Test wickets|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/india-v-new-zealand-2016-17/content/story/1059023.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|date=25 September 2016|access-date=25 September 2016}}</ref> In 2016, he became the third Indian to win the [[ICC Awards#2016 awards|ICC Cricketer of the Year]] award.\n\nHaving achieved little success as an [[opening batsman]] at junior-level cricket, Ashwin dropped down the order and turned into an off-break bowler. He made his first-class debut for Tamil Nadu in December 2006 and captained the team the following season. But it was not until the [[2010 Indian Premier League]] in which he played for the [[Chennai Super Kings]], that he came into the limelight with his economical bowling and earned his maiden international call-up in the limited-overs formats in June 2010. He was the leading wicket-taker and player of the tournament of the [[2010 Champions League Twenty20]] in South Africa. He was also part of the Indian squad that won the [[2011 Cricket World Cup]]. Later that year, he made his Test debut against West Indies and became the seventh Indian to [[List of India cricketers who have taken five-wicket hauls on Test debut|take a five-wicket haul]] on Test debut. He took two five-wicket hauls and scored a century in that series and won the player of the series award.\n\nAshwin continued to succeed in the subcontinent but proved to be less effective in other places like Australia and England. In a home Test series against Australia in 2013, he took 29 wickets, the most by any Indian bowler in a four-match Test series. The same year, he took his 100th Test wicket in his 18th match, becoming the fastest Indian bowler to the milestone and the fastest in the world in over 80 years. In 2017, playing his 45th Test, Ashwin became the fastest bowler to pick up 250 Test wickets, bettering [[Dennis Lillee]], who had achieved the landmark in 48 Tests.<ref>{{cite web|title=India v Bangladesh: R Ashwin becomes fastest to 250 Test wickets|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/bangladesh-in-india/india-v-bangladesh-r-ashwin-becomes-fastest-to-250-test-wickets/articleshow/57107038.cms|website=The Times of India|accessdate=12 February 2017}}</ref> In October 2019, in his 66th Test match, Ashwin became the joint-fastest bowler, along with [[Muttiah Muralitharan]], to take his 350th Test wicket.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/india-vs-south-africa-r-ashwin-muttiah-muralitharan-world-record-fastest-350-wickets-1606530-2019-10-06 |title=India vs South Africa: R Aswhin equals Muttiah Muralitharan's record for fastest to 350 Test wickets |work=India Today |accessdate=6 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nAshwin is the only bowler in recent times, apart from Sri Lanka's [[Ajantha Mendis]] to bowl the [[carrom ball]].
