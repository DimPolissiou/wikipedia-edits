{"title_page": "Mask (computing)", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=October 2019}}\n{{Redirect|Signal masking||Masking (disambiguation)}}\n\nIn [[computer science]], a '''mask''' or '''bitmask''' is data that is used for [[bitwise operation]]s, particularly in a [[bit field]]. Using a mask, multiple bits in a [[byte]], [[nibble]], [[Word (computer architecture)|word]] etc. can be set either on, off or inverted from on to off (or vice versa) in a single bitwise operation.\n\n==Common bitmask functions==\n\n===Masking bits to <code>1</code>===\nTo turn certain bits on, the [[Logical disjunction|bitwise <code>OR</code>]] operation can be used, following [[Logical disjunction#Bitwise operation|the principle]] that <code>Y OR 1 = 1</code> and <code>Y OR 0 = Y</code>. Therefore, to make sure a bit is on, <code>OR</code> can be used with a <code>1</code>. To leave a bit unchanged, <code>OR</code> is used with a <code>0</code>.\n\nExample: Masking ''on'' the higher [[nibble]] (bits 4, 5, 6, 7) the lower nibble (bits 0, 1, 2, 3) unchanged. \n     '''1001'''0101   '''1010'''0101\n  OR '''1111'''0000   '''1111'''0000\n   = '''1111'''0101   '''1111'''0101\n\n===Masking bits to <code>0</code>===\nMore often in practice bits are \"masked ''off''\" (or masked to <code>0</code>) than \"masked ''on''\" (or masked to <code>1</code>). When a bit is <code>AND</code>ed with a 0, the result is always 0, i.e. <code>Y AND 0 = 0</code>. To leave the other bits as they were originally, they can be <code>AND</code>ed with <code>1</code>, since <code>Y AND 1 = Y</code>.\n\nExample: Masking ''off'' the higher [[nibble]] (bits 4, 5, 6, 7) the lower nibble (bits 0, 1, 2, 3) unchanged. \n     '''1010'''0101   '''1010'''0101\n AND '''0000'''1111   '''0000'''1111\n   = '''0000'''0101   '''0000'''0101\n\n===Querying the status of a bit===\nIt is possible to use bitmasks to easily check the state of individual bits regardless of the other bits. To do this, turning off all the other bits using the bitwise <code>AND</code> is done as discussed [[#Masking bits to 0|above]] and the value is compared with <code>1</code>. If it is equal to <code>0</code>, then the bit was off, but if the value is any other value, then the bit was on. What makes this convenient is that it is not necessary to figure out what the value actually is, just that it is not <code>0</code>.\n\nExample: Querying the status of the 4th bit\n     1001'''1'''101   1001'''0'''101\n AND 0000'''1'''000   0000'''1'''000\n   = 0000'''1'''000   0000'''0'''000\n\n===Toggling bit values===\nSo far the article has covered how to turn bits on and turn bits off, but not both at once. Sometimes it does not really matter what the value is, but it must be made the opposite of what it currently is. This can be achieved using the [[Exclusive or|<code>XOR</code> (exclusive or)]] operation. <code>XOR</code> returns <code>1</code> [[if and only if]] an [[odd number]] of bits are <code>1</code>. Therefore, if two corresponding bits are <code>1</code>, the result will be a <code>0</code>, but if only one of them is <code>1</code>, the result will be <code>1</code>. Therefore inversion of the values of bits is done by <code>XOR</code>ing them with a <code>1</code>. If the original bit was <code>1</code>, it returns <code>1 XOR 1 = 0</code>. If the original bit was <code>0</code> it returns <code>0 XOR 1 = 1</code>. Also note that <code>XOR</code> masking is bit-safe, meaning that it will not affect unmasked bits because <code>Y XOR 0 = Y</code>, just like an <code>OR</code>.\n\nExample: Toggling bit values\n     10011101   10010101\n XOR '''00001111   11111111'''\n   = 10010010   01101010\n\nTo write arbitrary 1s and 0s to a subset of bits, first write 0s to that subset, then set the high bits:\n\n   register = (register & ~bitmask) | value;\n\n==Uses of bitmasks==\n\n=== Arguments to functions ===\nIn programming languages such as [[C (language)|C]], bit fields are a useful way to pass a set of named boolean arguments to a function. For example, in the graphics API [[OpenGL]], there is a command, <code>glClear()</code> which clears the screen or other buffers. It can clear up to four buffers (the color, depth, accumulation, and [[stencil buffer]]s), so the API authors could have had it take four arguments. But then a call to it would look like\n<source lang=\"c\"> glClear(1,1,0,0); // This is not how glClear actually works and would make for unstable code.</source>\nwhich is not very descriptive. Instead there are four defined field bits, <code>GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT</code>, <code>GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT</code>, <code>GL_ACCUM_BUFFER_BIT</code>, and <code>GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT</code> and <code>glClear()</code> is declared as\n<source lang=\"c\"> void glClear(GLbitfield bits);</source>\nThen a call to the function looks like this\n<source lang=\"c\"> glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);</source>\nInternally, a function taking a bitfield like this can use binary <code>and</code> to extract the individual bits. For example, an implementation of <code>glClear()</code> might look like:\n<source lang=\"c\">\nvoid glClear(GLbitfield bits) {\n  if ((bits & GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT) != 0) {\n    // Clear color buffer.\n  }\n  if ((bits & GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT) != 0) {\n    // Clear depth buffer.\n  }\n  if ((bits & GL_ACCUM_BUFFER_BIT) != 0) {\n    // Clear accumulation buffer.\n  }\n  if ((bits & GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT) != 0) {\n    // Clear stencil buffer.\n  }\n}</source>\nThe advantage to this approach is that function argument overhead is decreased. Since the minimum datum size is one byte, separating the options into separate arguments would be wasting seven bits per argument and would occupy more stack space. Instead, functions typically accept one or more 32-bit integers, with up to 32 option bits in each. While elegant, in the simplest implementation this solution is not [[type safety|type-safe]]. A <code>GLbitfield</code> is simply defined to be an <code>unsigned int</code>, so the compiler would allow a meaningless call to <code>glClear(42)</code> or even <code>glClear(GL_POINTS)</code>. In [[C++]] an alternative would be to create a class to encapsulate the set of arguments that glClear could accept and could be cleanly encapsulated in a library (see the external links for an example).\n\n===Inverse masks===\nMasks are used with IP addresses in IP ACLs (Access Control Lists) to specify what should be permitted and denied. To configure IP addresses on interfaces, masks start with 255 and have the large values on the left side: for example, IP address 209.165.202.129 with a 255.255.255.224 mask. Masks for IP ACLs are the reverse: for example, mask 0.0.0.255. This is sometimes called an inverse mask or a [[wildcard mask]]. When the value of the mask is broken down into binary (0s and 1s), the results determine which address bits are to be considered in processing the traffic. A 0 indicates that the address bits must be considered (exact match); a 1 in the mask is a \"don't care\". This table further explains the concept.\n\nMask example:\n\nnetwork address (traffic that is to be processed) \t\n10.1.1.0\n\nmask\t\n0.0.0.255\n\nnetwork address (binary)\t\n00001010.00000001.00000001.00000000\n\nmask (binary)\t\n00000000.00000000.00000000.11111111\n\nBased on the binary mask, it can be seen that the first three sets ([[Octet (computing)|octets]]) must match the given binary network address exactly (00001010.00000001.00000001). The last set of numbers is made of \"don't cares\" (.11111111). Therefore, all traffic that begins with 10.1.1. matches since the last octet is \"don't care\". Therefore, with this mask, network addresses 10.1.1.1 through 10.1.1.255 (10.1.1.x) are processed.\n\nSubtract the normal mask from 255.255.255.255 in order to determine the ACL inverse mask. In this example, the inverse mask is determined for network address 172.16.1.0 with a normal mask of 255.255.255.0.\n\n255.255.255.255 - 255.255.255.0 (normal mask) = 0.0.0.255 (inverse mask)\n\nACL equivalents\n\nThe source/source-wildcard of 0.0.0.0/255.255.255.255 means \"any\".\n\nThe source/wildcard of 10.1.1.2/0.0.0.0 is the same as \"host 10.1.1.2\"\n\n===Image masks===\n{{see also|Bit blit|Clipping path}}\n[[Image:Blit dot.gif|thumb|[[Raster graphics|Raster graphic]] [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s (left) and masks (right)]]\nIn [[computer graphics]], when a given image is intended to be placed over a background, the transparent areas can be specified through a binary mask. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/11/19/mask-r-cnn-with-opencv/|title=Mask R-CNN with OpenCV|date=2018-11-19|website=PyImageSearch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>This way, for each intended image there are actually two [[bitmap]]s: the actual image, in which the  unused areas are given a [[pixel]] value with all [[bit]]s set to 0s, and an additional ''mask'', in which the correspondent image areas are given a pixel value of all bits set to 0s and the surrounding areas a value of all bits set to 1s. In the sample at right, black pixels have the all-zero bits and white pixels have the all-one bits.\n\nAt [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]], to put the image on the screen over the background, the program first masks the screen pixel's bits with the image mask at the desired coordinates using the [[bitwise AND]] operation. This preserves the background pixels of the transparent areas while resets with zeros the bits of the pixels which will be obscured by the overlapped image.\n\nThen, the program renders the image pixel's bits by combining them with the background pixel's bits using the [[Logical disjunction|bitwise OR]] operation. This way, the image pixels are appropriately placed while keeping the background surrounding pixels preserved. The result is a perfect compound of the image over the background.\n\n[[Image:Sprite rendering by binary image mask.png|center]]\n\nThis technique is used for painting pointing device cursors, in typical 2-D videogames for characters, bullets and so on (the [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s), for [[GUI]] [[Icon (computing)|icon]]s, and for video titling and other image mixing applications.\n\nAlthough related (due to being used for the same purposes), [[Palette (computing)#Transparent color in palettes|transparent color]]s and [[alpha channel]]s are techniques which do not involve the image pixel mixage by binary masking.\n\n===Hash tables===\nTo create a hashing function for a [[hash table]], often a function is used that has a large domain. To create an index from the output of the function, a modulo can be taken to reduce the size of the domain to match the size of the array; however, it is often faster on many processors to restrict the size of the hash table to powers of two sizes and use a bitmask instead.\n\nAn example of both modulo and masking in C:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\n#include <stdint.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main(void) {\n    const uint32_t NUM_BUCKETS = 0xFFFFFFFF;  // 2^32\n    const uint32_t MAX_RECORDS = 1<<10;  // 2^10\n    const uint32_t HASH_BITMASK = 0x3FF;  // (2^10)-1\n\n    char **token_array = NULL;\n    // Handle memory allocation for token_array\u2026\n\n    char token[] = \"some hashable value\";\n    uint32_t hashed_token = hash_function(token, strlen(token), NUM_BUCKETS);\n\n    // Using modulo\n    size_t index = hashed_token % MAX_RECORDS;\n\n    // OR\n\n    // Using bitmask\n    size_t index = hashed_token & HASH_BITMASK;\n\n    *(token_array+index) = token;\n\n    // Free the memory from token_array \u2026\n    return 0;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Affinity mask]]\n*[[Bit field]]\n*[[Bit manipulation]]\n*[[Bitwise operation]]\n*[[Subnetwork]]\n*[[Tagged pointer]]\n*[[umask]]\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://bitbucket.org/fudepan/mili/wiki/BitwiseEnums bit_enum: a type-safe C++ library for bitwise operations]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[Category:Binary arithmetic]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mask (Computing)}}\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=October 2019}}\n{{Redirect|Signal masking||Masking (disambiguation)}}\n\nIn [[computer science]], a '''mask''' or '''bitmask''' is data that is used for [[bitwise operation]]s, particularly in a [[bit field]].

This table further explains the concept.\n\nMask example:\n\nnetwork address (traffic that is to be processed) \t\n10.1.1.0\n\nmask\t\n0.0.0.255\n\nnetwork address (binary)\t\n00001010.00000001.00000001.00000000\n\nmask (binary)\t\n00000000.00000000.00000000.11111111\n\nBased on the binary mask, it can be seen that the first three sets ([[Octet (computing)|octets]]) must match the given binary network address exactly (00001010.00000001.00000001). The last set of numbers is made of \"don't cares\" (.11111111). Therefore, all traffic that begins with 10.1.1. matches since the last octet is \"don't care\". Therefore, with this mask, network addresses 10.1.1.1 through 10.1.1.255 (10.1.1.x) are processed.\n\nSubtract the normal mask from 255.255.255.255 in order to determine the ACL inverse mask. In this example, the inverse mask is determined for network address 172.16.1.0 with a normal mask of 255.255.255.0.\n\n255.255.255.255 - 255.255.255.0 (normal mask) = 0.0.0.255 (inverse mask)\n\nACL equivalents\n\nThe source/source-wildcard of 0.0.0.0/255.255.255.255 means \"any\".\n\nThe source/wildcard of 10.1.1.2/0.0.0.0 is the same as \"host 10.1.1.2\"\n\n===Image masks===\n{{see also|Bit blit|Clipping path}}\n[[Image:Blit dot.gif|thumb|[[Raster graphics|Raster graphic]] [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s (left) and masks (right)]]\nIn [[computer graphics]], when a given image is intended to be placed over a background, the transparent areas can be specified through a binary mask. This way, for each intended image there are actually two [[bitmap]]s: the actual image, in which the  unused areas are given a [[pixel]] value with all [[bit]]s set to 0s, and an additional ''mask'', in which the correspondent image areas are given a pixel value of all bits set to 0s and the surrounding areas a value of all bits set to 1s. In the sample at right, black pixels have the all-zero bits and white pixels have the all-one bits.\n\nAt [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]], to put the image on the screen over the background, the program first masks the screen pixel's bits with the image mask at the desired coordinates using the [[bitwise AND]] operation. This preserves the background pixels of the transparent areas while resets with zeros the bits of the pixels which will be obscured by the overlapped image.\n\nThen, the program renders the image pixel's bits by combining them with the background pixel's bits using the [[Logical disjunction|bitwise OR]] operation. This way, the image pixels are appropriately placed while keeping the background surrounding pixels preserved. The result is a perfect compound of the image over the background.\n\n[[Image:Sprite rendering by binary image mask.png|center]]\n\nThis technique is used for painting pointing device cursors, in typical 2-D videogames for characters, bullets and so on (the [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s), for [[GUI]] [[Icon (computing)|icon]]s, and for video titling and other image mixing applications.\n\nAlthough related (due to being used for the same purposes), [[Palette (computing)#Transparent color in palettes|transparent color]]s and [[alpha channel]]s are techniques which do not involve the image pixel mixage by binary masking.\n\n===Hash tables===\nTo create a hashing function for a [[hash table]], often a function is used that has a large domain. To create an index from the output of the function, a modulo can be taken to reduce the size of the domain to match the size of the array; however, it is often faster on many processors to restrict the size of the hash table to powers of two sizes and use a bitmask instead.\n\nAn example of both modulo and masking in C:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\n#include <stdint.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main(void) {\n    const uint32_t NUM_BUCKETS = 0xFFFFFFFF;  // 2^32\n    const uint32_t MAX_RECORDS = 1<<10;  // 2^10\n    const uint32_t HASH_BITMASK = 0x3FF;  // (2^10)-1\n\n    char **token_array = NULL;\n    // Handle memory allocation for token_array\u2026\n\n    char token[] = \"some hashable value\";\n    uint32_t hashed_token = hash_function(token, strlen(token), NUM_BUCKETS);\n\n    // Using modulo\n    size_t index = hashed_token % MAX_RECORDS;\n\n    // OR\n\n    // Using bitmask\n    size_t index = hashed_token & HASH_BITMASK;\n\n    *(token_array+index) = token;\n\n    // Free the memory from token_array \u2026\n    return 0;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Affinity mask]]\n*[[Bit field]]\n*[[Bit manipulation]]\n*[[Bitwise operation]]\n*[[Subnetwork]]\n*[[Tagged pointer]]\n*[[umask]]\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://bitbucket.org/fudepan/mili/wiki/BitwiseEnums bit_enum: a type-safe C++ library for bitwise operations]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[Category:Binary arithmetic]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mask (Computing)}}\n", "name_user": "Dashingdang", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added a source/referece", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask_(computing)"}

After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]].

He was a student of [[Schelling]] and a teacher of [[Bergson]]. His philosophy fits in the tradition of [[Spiritualism_(philosophy)|French Spiritualism]]. He was influenced by [[Maine de Biran]] re-actualized the Aristotelian Metaphysics and critique of eclectism of [[Victor Cousin]] in ''La philosophie en France au XIXe si\u00e8cle''. He did not occupy a university chair, but he was the conservator of the department of antiquities at the [[Louvre]], president of the jury of the [[:fr:Agr%C3%A9gation de philosophie en France|Aggregation of philosophy in France]] and [[:fr:Inspection g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale des biblioth%C3%A8ques|Inspector General of Libraries]].<ref>[[:fr:F%C3%A9lix Ravaisson]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Biography==\nRavaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870).
