Maternal mortality has additional challenges, especially as they pertain to [[Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society|stillbirths]], abortions, and multiple births. In some countries, during the 1920s, a stillbirth was defined as \"a birth of at least twenty weeks' gestation in which the child shows no evidence of life after complete birth\". In most countries, however, a stillbirth was defined as \"the birth of a fetus, after 28 weeks of pregnancy, in which pulmonary respiration does not occur\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Death in Childbirth: An International Study of Maternal Care and Maternal Mortality 1800\u20131950 \u2013 Oxford Scholarship|language=en|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198229971.001.0001|isbn=9780191678950|publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1992|last1=Loudon|first1=Irvine}}</ref>\n\n===Census data and vital statistics===\nIdeally, all mortality estimation would be done using vital statistics and census data. Census data will give detailed information about the population at risk of death. The vital statistics provide information about live births and deaths in the population.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Tim\u00e6us|first=Ian M.|date=1991|title=Measurement of Adult Mortality in Less Developed Countries: A Comparative Review|jstor=3644262|journal=Population Index|volume=57|issue=4|pages=552\u2013568|doi=10.2307/3644262}}</ref> Often, either census data and vital statistics data is not available. This is especially true in developing countries, countries that are in conflict, areas where natural disasters have caused mass displacement, and other areas where there is a humanitarian crisis <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Household surveys===\nHousehold surveys or interviews are another way in which mortality rates are often assessed. There are several methods to estimate mortality in different segments of the population. One such example is the sisterhood method, which involves researchers estimating maternal mortality by contacting women in populations of interest and asking whether or not they have a sister, if the sister is of child-bearing age (usually 15) and conducting an interview or written questions about possible deaths among sisters. The sisterhood method, however, does not work in cases where sisters may have died before the sister being interviewed was born.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=W.|last2=Brass|first2=W.|last3=Snow|first3=R.

It has often been criticized as an adult mortality rate that is very biased for several reasons. The adoption effect is one such instance in which orphans often do not realize that they are adopted. Additionally, interviewers may not realize that an adoptive or foster parent is not the child's biological parent. There is also the issue of parents being reported on by multiple children while some adults have no children, thus are not counted in mortality estimates.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWidowhood surveys estimate adult mortality by responding to questions about the deceased husband or wife. One limitation of the widowhood survey surrounds the issues of divorce, where people may be more likely to report that they are widowed in places where there is the great social stigma around being a divorcee. Another limitation is that multiple marriages introduce biased estimates, so individuals are often asked about first marriage. Biases will be significant if the association of death between spouses, such as those in countries with large AIDS epidemics.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Sampling===\nSampling refers to the selection of a subset of the population of interest to efficiently gain information about the entire population. Samples should be representative of the population of interest. [[Cluster sampling]] is an approach to non-probability sampling; this is an approach in which each member of the population is assigned to a group (cluster), and then clusters are randomly selected, and all members of selected clusters are included in the sample. Often combined with stratification techniques (in which case it is called [[multistage sampling]]), cluster sampling is the approach most often used by epidemiologists. In areas of forced migration, there is more significant [[sampling error]]. Thus cluster sampling is not the ideal choice.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK220916/|title=Estimating Mortality Rates|last=Migration|first=National Research Council (US) Roundtable on the Demography of Forced|date=2002|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Mortality statistics==\n{{For|worldwide statistics|List of sovereign states and dependent territories by mortality rate}}\nCauses of death vary greatly between developed and less [[developed countries]];{{cn|date=January 2020}} see also [[list of causes of death by rate]] for worldwide statistics.\n<div>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; text-align:left\"\n|+ World historical and predicted crude death rates (1950\u20132050) <br /><small>UN, medium variant, 2012 rev.</small><ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=PopDiv&f=variableID:65|title=UNdata - record view - Crude death rate (deaths per 1,000 population)|author=|date=|website=data.un.org}}</ref>\n|-\n!Years!!CDR!!Years!!CDR\n|-\n|1950\u20131955|| align=\"center\" |19.1||2000\u20132005|| align=\"center\" |8.4\n|-\n||1955\u20131960|| align=\"center\" |17.3||2005\u20132010|| align=\"center\" |8.1\n|-\n||1960\u20131965|| align=\"center\" |16.2||2010\u20132015|| align=\"center\" |8.1\n|-\n||1965\u20131970|| align=\"center\" |12.9||2015\u20132020|| align=\"center\" |8.1\n|-\n||1970\u20131975|| align=\"center\" |11.6||2020\u20132025|| align=\"center\" |8.1\n|-\n||1975\u20131980|| align=\"center\" |10.6||2025\u20132030|| align=\"center\" |8.3\n|-\n||1980\u20131985|| align=\"center\" |10.0||2030\u20132035|| align=\"center\" |8.6\n|-\n||1985\u20131990|| align=\"center\" |9.4||2035\u20132040|| align=\"center\" |9.0\n|-\n||1990\u20131995|| align=\"center\" |9.1||2040\u20132045|| align=\"center\" |9.4\n|-\n||1995\u20132000|| align=\"center\" |8.8||2045\u20132050|| align=\"center\" |9.7\n|}\n</div>\n\nThe ten countries with the highest crude death rate, according to the 2016 [[CIA World Factbook]] estimates, are:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2066rank.html|title=The World Factbook \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency \u2013 Country Comparison: Death Rate|author=|first=|date=|website=www.cia.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ececec; vertical-align:top;\"\n!Rank!!Country!!Death rate<br />(annual deaths/1,000 persons)\n|-\n|1||{{flag|Lesotho}}||14.9\n|-\n|2||{{flag|Bulgaria}}||14.5\n|-\n|3||{{flag|Lithuania}}||14.5\n|-\n|4||{{flag|Ukraine}}||14.4\n|-\n|5||{{flag|Latvia}}||14.4\n|-\n|6||{{flag|Guinea-Bissau}}||14.1\n|-\n|7||{{flag|Chad}}||14.0\n|-\n|8||{{flag|Afghanistan}}||13.7\n|-\n|9||{{flag|Serbia}}||13.6\n|-\n|10||{{flag|Russia}}||13.6\n|}\n\n[[File:Income death in logs graph.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Scatter plot of the [[natural logarithm]] (ln) of the crude death rate against the natural log of per capita real GDP.

People who have a lower standard of living are also more likely to face issues such as a lack of hygiene and sanitation, the increase of exposure to and the spread of disease, and a lack of access to proper medical care and facilities.

Mortality rates are usually difficult to predict due to language barriers, health infrastructure related issues, conflict, and other reasons. Maternal mortality has additional challenges, especially as they pertain to [[Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society|stillbirths]], abortions, and multiple births. In some countries, during the 1920s, a stillbirth was defined as \"a birth of at least twenty weeks' gestation in which the child shows no evidence of life after complete birth\". In most countries, however, a stillbirth was defined as \"the birth of a fetus, after 28 weeks of pregnancy, in which pulmonary respiration does not occur\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Death in Childbirth: An International Study of Maternal Care and Maternal Mortality 1800\u20131950 \u2013 Oxford Scholarship|language=en|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198229971.001.0001|isbn=9780191678950|publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1992|last1=Loudon|first1=Irvine}}</ref>\n\n===Census data and vital statistics===\nIdeally, all mortality estimation would be done using vital statistics and census data. Census data will give detailed information about the population at risk of death. The vital statistics provide information about live births and deaths in the population.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Tim\u00e6us|first=Ian M.|date=1991|title=Measurement of Adult Mortality in Less Developed Countries: A Comparative Review|jstor=3644262|journal=Population Index|volume=57|issue=4|pages=552\u2013568|doi=10.2307/3644262}}</ref> Often, either census data and vital statistics data is not available. This is especially true in developing countries, countries that are in conflict, areas where natural disasters have caused mass displacement, and other areas where there is a humanitarian crisis <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Household surveys===\nHousehold surveys or interviews are another way in which mortality rates are often assessed. There are several methods to estimate mortality in different segments of the population. One such example is the sisterhood method, which involves researchers estimating maternal mortality by contacting women in populations of interest and asking whether or not they have a sister, if the sister is of child-bearing age (usually 15) and conducting an interview or written questions about possible deaths among sisters. The sisterhood method, however, does not work in cases where sisters may have died before the sister being interviewed was born.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=W.|last2=Brass|first2=W.|last3=Snow|first3=R.

It has often been criticized as an adult mortality rate that is very biased for several reasons. The adoption effect is one such instance in which orphans often do not realize that they are adopted. Additionally, interviewers may not realize that an adoptive or foster parent is not the child's biological parent. There is also the issue of parents being reported on by multiple children while some adults have no children, thus are not counted in mortality estimates.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWidowhood surveys estimate adult mortality by responding to questions about the deceased husband or wife. One limitation of the widowhood survey surrounds the issues of divorce, where people may be more likely to report that they are widowed in places where there is the great social stigma around being a divorcee. Another limitation is that multiple marriages introduce biased estimates, so individuals are often asked about first marriage. Biases will be significant if the association of death between spouses, such as those in countries with large AIDS epidemics.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Sampling===\nSampling refers to the selection of a subset of the population of interest to efficiently gain information about the entire population. Samples should be representative of the population of interest. [[Cluster sampling]] is an approach to non-probability sampling; this is an approach in which each member of the population is assigned to a group (cluster), and then clusters are randomly selected, and all members of selected clusters are included in the sample. Often combined with stratification techniques (in which case it is called [[multistage sampling]]), cluster sampling is the approach most often used by epidemiologists. In areas of forced migration, there is more significant [[sampling error]]. Thus cluster sampling is not the ideal choice.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK220916/|title=Estimating Mortality Rates|last=Migration|first=National Research Council (US) Roundtable on the Demography of Forced|date=2002|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Mortality statistics==\n{{For|worldwide statistics|List of sovereign states and dependent territories by mortality rate}}\nCauses of death vary greatly between developed and less [[developed countries]];{{cn|date=January 2020}} see also [[list of causes of death by rate]] for worldwide statistics.\n<div>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; text-align:left\"\n|+ World historical and predicted crude death rates (1950\u20132050) <br /><small>UN, medium variant, 2012 rev.</small><ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=PopDiv&f=variableID:65|title=UNdata - record view - Crude death rate (deaths per 1,000 population)|author=|date=|website=data.un.org}}</ref>\n|-\n!Years!!CDR!!Years!!CDR\n|-\n|1950\u20131955|| align=\"center\" |19.1||2000\u20132005|| align=\"center\" |8.4\n|-\n||1955\u20131960|| align=\"center\" |17.3||2005\u20132010|| align=\"center\" |8.1\n|-\n||1960\u20131965|| align=\"center\" |16.2||2010\u20132015|| align=\"center\" |8.1\n|-\n||1965\u20131970|| align=\"center\" |12.9||2015\u20132020|| align=\"center\" |8.1\n|-\n||1970\u20131975|| align=\"center\" |11.6||2020\u20132025|| align=\"center\" |8.1\n|-\n||1975\u20131980|| align=\"center\" |10.6||2025\u20132030|| align=\"center\" |8.3\n|-\n||1980\u20131985|| align=\"center\" |10.0||2030\u20132035|| align=\"center\" |8.6\n|-\n||1985\u20131990|| align=\"center\" |9.4||2035\u20132040|| align=\"center\" |9.0\n|-\n||1990\u20131995|| align=\"center\" |9.1||2040\u20132045|| align=\"center\" |9.4\n|-\n||1995\u20132000|| align=\"center\" |8.8||2045\u20132050|| align=\"center\" |9.7\n|}\n</div>\n\nThe ten countries with the highest crude death rate, according to the 2016 [[CIA World Factbook]] estimates, are:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2066rank.html|title=The World Factbook \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency \u2013 Country Comparison: Death Rate|author=|first=|date=|website=www.cia.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ececec; vertical-align:top;\"\n!Rank!!Country!!Death rate<br />(annual deaths/1,000 persons)\n|-\n|1||{{flag|Lesotho}}||14.9\n|-\n|2||{{flag|Bulgaria}}||14.5\n|-\n|3||{{flag|Lithuania}}||14.5\n|-\n|4||{{flag|Ukraine}}||14.4\n|-\n|5||{{flag|Latvia}}||14.4\n|-\n|6||{{flag|Guinea-Bissau}}||14.1\n|-\n|7||{{flag|Chad}}||14.0\n|-\n|8||{{flag|Afghanistan}}||13.7\n|-\n|9||{{flag|Serbia}}||13.6\n|-\n|10||{{flag|Russia}}||13.6\n|}\n\n[[File:Income death in logs graph.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Scatter plot of the [[natural logarithm]] (ln) of the crude death rate against the natural log of per capita real GDP.

A low standard of living is more likely to create situations where malnutrition is more common, which can in turn cause the impacted people to become more susceptible to disease and an increased likelihood of dying from these diseases. People who have a lower standard of living are also more likely to face issues such as a lack of hygiene and sanitation, the increase of exposure to and the spread of disease, and a lack of access to proper medical care and facilities. Poor health can in turn contribute to low and reduced incomes, which can create a loop known as the health-poverty trap.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Health, Income, &amp; Poverty: Where We Are &amp; What Could Help|date=October 4, 2018|language=en|doi=10.1377/hpb20180817.901935}}</ref> Indian economist and philosopher [[Amartya Sen]] has stated that mortality rates can serve as an indicator of economic success and failure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sen|first=Amartya|date=1998|title=Mortality as an Indicator of Economic Success and Failure|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=108|issue=446|pages=1\u201325|issn=0013-0133|jstor=2565734|doi=10.1111/1468-0297.00270}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|title=Life under pressure: mortality and living standards in Europe and Asia, 1700\u20131900|last=Bengtsson|first=Tommy|last2=Campbell|first2=Cameron|last3=Lee|first3=James Z.|date=2004|publisher=MIT|isbn=978-0262268097|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=|oclc=57141654}}</ref>{{rp|27, 32}}\n\nHistorically, mortality rates have been adversely affected by short term price increases.

These children have a much greater chance of dying of diseases that have become very preventable in higher-income parts of the world. The instances of these children dying of things like malaria, respiratory infections, diarrhea, perinatal conditions, or measles are much more pronounced in developing nations. Data shows that after the age of 5 these preventable causes level out between high and low-income countries.

The type gained considerable fame as one was flown by [[Amelia Earhart]] on her ill-fated around-the-world expedition in 1937.\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:Kelly-Johnson Electra.jpg|thumb|left|[[Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson]] is testing an Electra model with single vertical tail and forward-sloping windshield in the [[University of Michigan]]'s wind tunnel.]]\n\nSome of Lockheed's wooden designs, such as the [[Lockheed Model 9 Orion|Orion]], had been built by [[Detroit Aircraft Corporation]] with metal fuselages. However, the Electra was Lockheed's first all-metal and twin-engined design by [[Lloyd Stearman]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Lloyd Stearman|url=http://www.nationalaviation.org/stearman-lloyd/|publisher=National Aviation Hall of Fame|accessdate=22 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=Edward H|title=Stearman Aircraft: A Detailed History|year=2006|publisher=Specialty PressPub & Wholesalers|page=26}}</ref> and [[Hall Hibbard]]. The name [[Electra (star)|Electra]] came from a star in the [[Pleiades]]. The prototype made its first flight on February 23, 1934, with [[Marshall Headle]] at the controls.<ref>Gunston 1998, p. 8.</ref>\n\nWind-tunnel work on the Electra was undertaken at the [[University of Michigan]]. Much of the work was performed by a student assistant, [[Clarence Johnson]]. He suggested two changes be made to the design: changing the single tail to double tails (later a Lockheed trademark), and deleting oversized wing fillets. Both of these suggestions were incorporated into production aircraft. Upon receiving his master's degree, Johnson joined Lockheed as a regular employee, ultimately leading the [[Skunk Works]] in developing advanced aircraft such as the [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird]].\n\nThe Lockheed Electra was one of the first commercial passenger aircraft with retractable landing gear to come equipped with mudguards as standard equipment, although aircraft with fixed landing gear commonly had mudguards much earlier than this.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=wt8DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA523 \"Mud Guards on Plane Wheels Protect Landing Gear.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1935, p. 523, (bottom-right).</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Lockheed 10B VH-ASM Marshall Aws Bankstown 4.10.70 edited-2.jpg|thumb|left|Lockheed 10B of Marshall Airways (Australia) in 1970, had been initially delivered to [[Ansett Airways]] in 1937]]\n\nAfter October 1934 when the US government banned single-engined aircraft for use in carrying passengers or in night flying, Lockheed was perfectly placed in the market with its new Model 10 Electra. In addition to deliveries to US-based airlines, several European operators added Electras to their prewar fleets. In Latin America, the first airline to use Electras was [[Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n]], starting in 1935, for its domestic routes.\n\n[[File:Lockheed 10A Electra flight deck.jpg|thumb|Flight deck of a Model 10A, which has been updated with a more modern instrument panel]]\n\nBesides airline orders, a number of non-commercial civil operators also purchased the new Model 10.<ref name= \"Winchester p. 188\">Winchester 2004, p. 188.</ref> In May 1937, [[Dick Merrill|H.T. \"Dick\" Merrill]] and J.S. Lambie accomplished a round-trip crossing of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The feat was declared the first round-trip commercial crossing of that ocean by any aircraft. It won them the [[Harmon Trophy]]. On the eastbound trip, they carried newsreels of the crash of the ''[[Hindenburg disaster|Hindenburg]]'', and on the return trip from the [[United Kingdom]], they brought photographs of the [[coronation of King George VI]]. [[Bata Shoes]] operated the Model 10 to ferry its executives between their European factories.\n\nProbably the most famous use of the Electra was the highly modified Model 10E flown by [[aviatrix]] [[Amelia Earhart]]. In July 1937, she disappeared in her Electra during an attempted round-the-world flight.<ref name= \"Winchester p. 188\"/>\n\nMany Electras and their design descendants (the [[Lockheed Model 12 Electra Junior|Model 12 Electra Junior]] and [[Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra|Model 14 Super Electra]]) were pressed into military service during [[World War II]], for instance the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]]'s '''C-36'''. By the end of the war, the Electra design was obsolete, although many smaller airlines and charter services continued to operate Electras into the 1970s.<ref name= \"Winchester p. 188\"/>\n\nElectras were popular as private planes for royalty in Asia and Europe. In [[India]], the [[Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]] and the [[Maharaja of Jodhpur]] both purchased them for their personal use in 1937.<ref>Straits Times, 30 December 1937, Page 10.</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Lockheed Y1C-36.jpg|thumb|right|Lockheed Y1C-36]]\n[[File:Lockheed Y1C-37.jpg|thumb|right|Lockheed Y1C-37]]\n[[File:Lockheed XC-35 parked.jpg|thumb|right|Lockheed XC-35]]\nThe Electra was produced in several variants, for both civilian and military customers.

The type gained considerable fame as one was flown by [[Amelia Earhart]] on her ill-fated around-the-world expedition in 1937.\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:Kelly-Johnson Electra.jpg|thumb|left|[[Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson]] is testing an Electra model with single vertical tail and forward-sloping windshield in the [[University of Michigan]]'s wind tunnel.]]\n\nSome of Lockheed's wooden designs, such as the [[Lockheed Model 9 Orion|Orion]], had been built by [[Detroit Aircraft Corporation]] with metal fuselages. However, the Electra was Lockheed's first all-metal and twin-engined design by [[Lloyd Stearman]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Lloyd Stearman|url=http://www.nationalaviation.org/stearman-lloyd/|publisher=National Aviation Hall of Fame|accessdate=22 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=Edward H|title=Stearman Aircraft: A Detailed History|year=2006|publisher=Specialty PressPub & Wholesalers|page=26}}</ref> and [[Hall Hibbard]]. The name [[Electra (star)|Electra]] came from a star in the [[Pleiades]]. The prototype made its first flight on February 23, 1934, with [[Marshall Headle]] at the controls.<ref>Gunston 1998, p. 8.</ref>\n\nWind-tunnel work on the Electra was undertaken at the [[University of Michigan]]. Much of the work was performed by a student assistant, [[Clarence Johnson]]. He suggested two changes be made to the design: changing the single tail to double tails (later a Lockheed trademark), and deleting oversized wing fillets. Both of these suggestions were incorporated into production aircraft. Upon receiving his master's degree, Johnson joined Lockheed as a regular employee, ultimately leading the [[Skunk Works]] in developing advanced aircraft such as the [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird]].\n\nThe Lockheed Electra was one of the first commercial passenger aircraft with retractable landing gear to come equipped with mudguards as standard equipment, although aircraft with fixed landing gear commonly had mudguards much earlier than this.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=wt8DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA523 \"Mud Guards on Plane Wheels Protect Landing Gear.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1935, p. 523, (bottom-right).</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Lockheed 10B VH-ASM Marshall Aws Bankstown 4.10.70 edited-2.jpg|thumb|left|Lockheed 10B of Marshall Airways (Australia) in 1970, had been initially delivered to [[Ansett Airways]] in 1937]]\n\nAfter October 1934 when the US government banned single-engined aircraft for use in carrying passengers or in night flying, Lockheed was perfectly placed in the market with its new Model 10 Electra. In addition to deliveries to US-based airlines, several European operators added Electras to their prewar fleets. In Latin America, the first airline to use Electras was [[Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n]], starting in 1935, for its domestic routes.\n\n[[File:Lockheed 10A Electra flight deck.jpg|thumb|Flight deck of a Model 10A, which has been updated with a more modern instrument panel]]\n\nBesides airline orders, a number of non-commercial civil operators also purchased the new Model 10.<ref name= \"Winchester p. 188\">Winchester 2004, p. 188.</ref> In May 1937, [[Dick Merrill|H.T. \"Dick\" Merrill]] and J.S. Lambie accomplished a round-trip crossing of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The feat was declared the first round-trip commercial crossing of that ocean by any aircraft. It won them the [[Harmon Trophy]]. On the eastbound trip, they carried newsreels of the crash of the ''[[Hindenburg disaster|Hindenburg]]'', and on the return trip from the [[United Kingdom]], they brought photographs of the [[coronation of King George VI]]. [[Bata Shoes]] operated the Model 10 to ferry its executives between their European factories.\n\nProbably the most famous use of the Electra was the highly modified Model 10E flown by [[aviatrix]] [[Amelia Earhart]]. In July 1937, she disappeared in her Electra during an attempted round-the-world flight.<ref name= \"Winchester p. 188\"/>\n\nMany Electras and their design descendants (the [[Lockheed Model 12 Electra Junior|Model 12 Electra Junior]] and [[Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra|Model 14 Super Electra]]) were pressed into military service during [[World War II]], for instance the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]]'s '''C-36'''. By the end of the war, the Electra design was obsolete, although many smaller airlines and charter services continued to operate Electras into the 1970s.<ref name= \"Winchester p. 188\"/>\n\nElectras were popular as private planes for royalty in Asia and Europe. In [[India]], the [[Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]] and the [[Maharaja of Jodhpur]] both purchased them for their personal use in 1937.<ref>Straits Times, 30 December 1937, Page 10.</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Lockheed Y1C-36.jpg|thumb|right|Lockheed Y1C-36]]\n[[File:Lockheed Y1C-37.jpg|thumb|right|Lockheed Y1C-37]]\n[[File:Lockheed XC-35 parked.jpg|thumb|right|Lockheed XC-35]]\nThe Electra was produced in several variants, for both civilian and military customers.

Throughout his career he played primarily as a right defensive midfielder and as a right central defender. He most notably played for Ajax and PSV in the [[Eredivisie]] and Genoa in the [[Serie A]]. Injury prone since the very beginning of his career, he was forced to quit prematurely at the age of 28.\n\n==Club career==\n===Early years===\nBorn a few months after the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] into a football crazy family in Suriname, Vink thanks his middle names to the feats of the Brazil national football team that year, as he was named after its captain [[Carlos Alberto Torres]]. The Vink family moved to the Netherlands, and it was there that young Marciano learned his trade at TOS Actief and ADE in [[Amsterdam]]. A prolific young player, Vink's talents were soon noticed by the Ajax scouts and it wasn't before long he was admitted to play for one of the greatest sides in European football history.\n\n===Career with Ajax===\nHe swiftly rose through ranks of Ajax's youth Academy with a number of extremely talented players such as: [[Dennis Bergkamp]], [[Frank de Boer]], [[Ronald de Boer]], [[Clarence Seedorf]], [[Ronald Koeman]] and [[Marco van Basten]]. Vink was deemed to be a huge prospect and was heralded to become the next [[Frank Rijkaard]]. His rise through the youth ranks and his debut at the age of 18 in 1988 were, however, no indication of how his career would ultimately unfold. He would play 108 matches in his 5-year stint with Ajax until coach [[Louis van Gaal]] decided to dismantle the team that won the UEFA Cup in 1992 to make way for a younger generation of players such as [[Patrick Kluivert]], Clarence Seedorf, [[Michael Reiziger]] and [[Edgar Davids]]. In 1993 Vink therefore opted for Italian side Genoa.\n\n===Career continued===\nVink's spell with Genoa turned out to be a disappointment. He played only 13 matches (2 goals), in a season which saw Genoa narrowly avoid relegation to [[Serie B]]. He quickly decided to move back to the Netherlands with top side PSV Eindhoven. Although PSV Eindhoven was progressively starting to challenge Ajax for the domination of the Eredivisie, Vink did not play the part his coaches might have had in mind for him as he was often sidelined through injury. In 1997 his injury plagued stay with PSV came to a grinding halt as [[Lu\u00eds Figo]] made an uncompromising tackle in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] match [[FC Barcelona]] - PSV. He spent the next two seasons rehabilitating, but to no avail. In 1999 his contract expired and he was not extended. He played only 48 matches in 5 seasons and was left with a damaged reputation. He decided to join 1st division outfit ADO Den Haag on amateur basis in order to revitalize his career, but only played 5 competition matches. After this, one could not help but think that the career of Marciano Vink was over. However, Vink showed his resilience by returning to professional football briefly, in order to show the critics that he had just been unlucky in his career and that he was indeed a quality player. He played for one more season with the Ajax satellite club Ajax Cape Town. The 1992 UEFA Cup winner turned out to be a more than welcome addition to the squad. In 2002, he permanently retired from professional football and became a player agent.\n\n==International career==\nMarciano Vink has capped twice for the Netherlands in 1991, at the height of his career. At the age of 20 he was called up by national team coach [[Rinus Michels]] for the European Championship qualifier matches for [[1992 UEFA European Football Championship|Sweden 1992]] against Malta and Finland. He earned two caps in one month, but was never called up again, mostly due to injury.\n\n==Trophies==\n {| class=\"wikitable\"\n ! Season\n ! Club\n !
