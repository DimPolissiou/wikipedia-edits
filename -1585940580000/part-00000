They are a subrange of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], and form part of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge Physiographic Province]].  The range is sometimes called the '''Smoky Mountains''' and the name is commonly shortened to the '''Smokies'''.  The Great Smokies are best known as the home of the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]], which protects most of the range.  The park was established in 1934, and, with over 11 million visits per year, it is the most visited national park in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Great Smokies Parkway Top List of Visitors|url=http://www.smliv.com/blog/great-smokies-parkway-top-list-of-visitors/|website=SMLiv.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Great Smokies are part of an [[International Biosphere Reserve]].  The range is home to an estimated {{convert|187000|acre|ha}} of [[old growth]] forest, constituting the largest such stand east of the [[Mississippi River]].<ref>Rose Houk, ''Great Smoky Mountains National Park: A Natural History Guide'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1993),  198.</ref><ref name = \"OldGrowthEastNC\" />  The [[cove (Appalachian Mountains)|cove]] hardwood forests in the range's lower elevations are among the most diverse ecosystems in North America, and the [[Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest]] that coats the range's upper elevations is the largest of its kind.<ref>Houk, 50.</ref> The Great Smokies are also home to the densest [[American black bear|black bear]] population in the Eastern United States and the most diverse [[salamander]] population outside of the tropics.<ref>Houk, 112, 119.</ref>\n\nAlong with the Biosphere reserve, the Great Smokies have been designated a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].  The U.S. [[National Park Service]] preserves and maintains [[List of historical structures maintained by the Great Smoky Mountains National Park|78 structures within the national park]] that were once part of the numerous small [[Appalachia]]n communities scattered throughout the range's river valleys and coves.  The park contains five historic districts and nine individual listings on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nThe name \"Smoky\" comes from the natural fog that often hangs over the range and presents as large smoke plumes from a distance.  This fog is caused by the vegetation exhaling [[volatile organic compounds]], chemicals that have a high vapor pressure and easily form vapors at normal temperature and pressure.<ref>Laura Naranjo, \"[http://earthdata.nasa.gov/featured-stories/featured-research/volatile-trees Volatile Trees],\" NASA.gov, 20 November 2011.

The northwestern half of the range gives way to a series of elongate ridges known as the \"Foothills,\" the outermost of which include [[Chilhowee Mountain]] and [[English Mountain]].  The range is roughly bounded on the south by the [[Tuckasegee River]] and to the southeast by Soco Creek and Jonathan Creek.  The Great Smokies comprise parts of [[Blount County, Tennessee|Blount County]], [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]], and [[Cocke County, Tennessee|Cocke County]] in Tennessee and [[Swain County, North Carolina|Swain County]] and [[Haywood County, North Carolina|Haywood County]] in North Carolina.\n\nThe sources of several rivers are located in the Smokies, including the [[Little Pigeon River (Tennessee)|Little Pigeon River]], the [[Oconaluftee River]], and [[Little River (Tennessee)|Little River]].  Streams in the Smokies are part of the [[Tennessee River]] watershed and are thus entirely west of the [[Eastern Continental Divide]].  The largest stream wholly within the park is [[Abrams Creek (Tennessee)|Abrams Creek]], which rises in Cades Cove and empties into the Chilhowee Lake impoundment of the Little Tennessee River near [[Chilhowee Dam]].  \n\nOther major streams include Hazel Creek and Eagle Creek in the southwest, Raven Fork near [[Oconaluftee (Great Smoky Mountains)|Oconaluftee]], Cosby Creek near [[Cosby, Tennessee|Cosby]], and [[Roaring Fork (Great Smoky Mountains)|Roaring Fork]] near [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee|Gatlinburg]].  The Little Tennessee River passes through five impoundments along the range's southwestern boundary, namely [[Tellico Lake]], [[Chilhowee Dam|Chilhowee Lake]], [[Calderwood Dam|Calderwood Lake]], [[Cheoah Dam|Cheoah Lake]], and [[Fontana Lake]].\n\n===Notable peaks===\nThe highest point in the Smokies is [[Clingmans Dome]], which rises to an elevation of {{convert|6643|ft|m}}.  The mountain is the highest in Tennessee and the third highest in the Appalachian range.  Clingmans Dome also has the range's highest [[topographical prominence]] at {{convert|4503|ft|m}}.  [[Mount Le Conte (Tennessee)|Mount Le Conte]] is the ''tallest'' (i.e., from immediate base to summit) mountain in the range, rising {{convert|5301|ft|m}} from its base in Gatlinburg to its {{convert|6593|ft|m|sing=on}} summit.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n!

The Ocoee Supergroup consists primarily of slightly metamorphosed sandstones, phyllites, schists, and slate.  Early Precambrian rocks, which include the oldest rocks in the Smokies, comprise the dominant rock type in the Raven Fork Valley (near [[Oconaluftee (Great Smoky Mountains)|Oconaluftee]]) and lower Tuckasegee River between [[Cherokee, North Carolina|Cherokee]] and [[Bryson City, North Carolina|Bryson City]].  They consist primarily of metamorphic [[gneiss]], [[granite]], and [[schist]].  Cambrian sedimentary rocks are found among the outer reaches of the Foothills to the northwest and in limestone coves such as [[Cades Cove]].<ref>Harry Moore, ''A Roadside Guide to the Geology of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 32.</ref>\n\nThe Precambrian gneiss and schists\u2014the oldest rocks in the Smokies\u2014formed over a billion years ago from the accumulation of marine sediments and igneous rock in a primordial ocean.  In the Late Precambrian period, this ocean expanded, and the more recent Ocoee Supergroup rocks formed from accumulations of the eroding land mass onto the ocean's continental shelf.<ref name=\"houk_10-17\">Houk, 10\u201317.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the [[Paleozoic]] era, the ancient ocean had deposited a thick layer of marine sediments which left behind sedimentary rocks such as limestone.  During the Ordovician period, the North American and African plates collided, destroying the ancient ocean and initiating the [[Alleghenian orogeny]]\u2014the mountain-building epoch that created the Appalachian range.  The Mesozoic era saw the rapid erosion of the softer sedimentary rocks from the new mountains, re-exposing the older Ocoee Supergroup formations.<ref name=\"houk_10-17\" />\n\nAround 20,000 years ago, subarctic glaciers advanced southward across North America, and although they never reached the Smokies, the advancing glaciers led to colder mean annual temperatures and an increase in precipitation throughout the range.  Trees were unable to survive at the higher elevations, and were replaced by [[tundra]] vegetation.  Spruce-fir forests occupied the valleys and slopes below approximately {{convert|4950|ft|m}}.  The persistent freezing and thawing during this period created the large blockfields that are often found at the base of large mountain slopes.<ref name=\"moore_40-44\">Moore, 40-44.</ref> \n\nBetween 16,500 and 12,500 years ago, the glaciers to the north retreated and mean annual temperatures rose.  The tundra vegetation disappeared, and the spruce-fir forests retreated to the highest elevations.  Hardwood trees moved into the region from the coastal plains, replacing the spruce-fir forests in the lower elevations.  The temperatures continued warming until around 6,000 years ago, when they began to gradually grow cooler.<ref name=\"moore_40-44\" />\n\n==Flora==\n{{see also|Appalachian temperate rainforest}}\n\nHeavy logging in the late 19th century and early 20th century devastated much of the forests of the Smokies, but the National Park Service estimates {{convert|187000|acre|km2}} of old growth forest remains,<ref name=\"OldGrowthEastNC\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.primalnature.org/ogeast/nc.pdf \n |title=Old Growth in the East: A Survey.

Beech gaps consist of high mountain gaps that have been monopolized by beech trees.  The beech trees are often twisted and contorted by the high winds that occur in these gaps.  Why other tree types such as the red spruce fail to encroach into the beech gaps is unknown.<ref>Houk, 30.</ref>\n\n===Spruce-fir forest===\n[[File:Clingmans Dome-27527-1.jpg|thumb|[[Spruce fir]] stand near the summit of Clingmans Dome]]\n\nThe spruce-fir forest\u2014also called the \"boreal\" or \"Canadian\" forest\u2014is a relict of the [[ice ages]], when mean annual temperatures in the Smokies were too cold to support a hardwood forest.

The Fraser Firs, which are native to Southern Appalachia, once dominated elevations above {{convert|6200|ft|m}} in the Great Smokies.  Most of these firs were killed, however, by an infestation of the [[balsam wooly adelgid]], which arrived in the Smokies in the early 1960s.  Thus, red spruce is now the dominant species in the range's spruce-fir forest.  Large stands of dead Fraser Firs remain atop Clingmans Dome and on the northwestern slopes of Old Black.  While much of the red spruce stands in the Smokies were logged during [[World War I]], the tree is still common throughout the range above {{convert|5500|ft|m}}.  Some of the red spruce trees in the Smokies are believed to be 300 years old, and the tallest rise to over {{convert|100|ft|m}}.<ref>Houk, 50-53.</ref>\n\nThe main difference between the spruce-fir forests of Southern Appalachia and the spruce-fir forests in northern latitudes is the dense broad-leaved understory of the former.  The spruce-fir understories of the Smokies are home to [[Rhododendron catawbiense|catawba rhododendron]], [[Sorbus americana|mountain ash]], [[Prunus pensylvanica|pin cherry]], thornless blackberry, and [[Viburnum lantanoides|hobblebush]].  The herbaceous and litter layers of the spruce-fir forests are poorly lit year-round, and are thus dominated by shade-tolerant plants such as ferns, namely [[Dryopteris campyloptera|mountain wood fern]] and [[Athyrium filix-femina|northern lady fern]], and over 280 species of mosses.<ref>Houk, 50, 54-55.</ref>\n\n===Wildflowers===\n{{Main|Wildflowers of the Great Smoky Mountains}}\n\n[[File:Ben-parton-mtn-laurel-tn1.jpg|thumb|[[Rhododendron]] atop the Ben Parton Lookout]]\n\nMany [[wildflower]]s grow in mountains and valleys of the Great Smokies, including [[bee balm]], [[Polygonatum|Solomon's seal]], [[Dutchman's breeches]], various [[trillium]]s, the Dragon's Advocate and even hardy [[orchid]]s.  There are two native species of rhododendron in the area.  The [[Catawba rhododendron]] has purple flowers in May and June, while the [[rhododendron|rosebay rhododendron]] has longer leaves and blooms white or a light pink in June and July.  \n\nThe orange- to sometimes red-flowered and deciduous [[Rhododendron calendulaceum|flame azalea]] closely follows along with the Catawbas.  The closely related [[Kalmia latifolia|mountain laurel]] blooms in between the two, and all of the blooms progress from lower to higher elevations.  The reverse is true in [[autumn]], when nearly bare mountaintops covered in [[Rime (frost)|rime ice]] (frozen fog) can be separated from green [[valley]]s by very bright and varied leaf colors.  The rhododendrons are [[Broadleaf tree|broadleaf]]s, whose leaves droop in order to shed wet and heavy [[snow]]s that come through the region during winter.\n\n==Fauna==\n[[File:Bear-great-smoky-mtns-nps1.jpg|thumb|A black bear in the Great Smokies]]\n\nThe Great Smoky Mountains are home to 66 species of mammals, over 240 species of birds, 43 species of amphibians, 60 species of fish, and 40 species of reptiles.

The Smokies, along with the Unicois, provided the main bulwark dividing the [[Overhill Cherokee]] villages in modern Tennessee from the Cherokee Middle towns in modern North Carolina.  The Overhill town of [[Chilhowee (Cherokee town)|Chilhowee]] was situated at the confluence of Abrams Creek and the Little Tennessee, and the Overhill town of [[Tallassee (Cherokee town)|Tallassee]] was located just a few miles upstream near modern [[Calderwood, Tennessee|Calderwood]] (both village sites are now under Chilhowee Lake).  A string of Overhill villages, including [[Chota (Cherokee town)|Chota]] and [[Tanasi]], dotted the Little Tennessee valley north of Chilhowee.<ref>Gerald Schroedl, \"[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=1026 Overhill Cherokees].\"  ''The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture'', 2002.

The green areas denote the modern national park.]]\n\nEuropean explorers and settlers began arriving in Western North Carolina and East Tennessee in the mid-18th century.  The influx of settlers at the end of the [[French and Indian War]] brought conflict with the Cherokee, who still held legal title to much of the land.  When the Cherokee aligned themselves with the British at the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]] in 1776, American forces launched an invasion of Cherokee territory.<ref name=\"vicki_rozema\">Vicki Rozema, ''Footsteps of the Cherokees'' (Winston-Salem: John F. Blair Publisher, 1995), 58\u201360.</ref>\n\nThe Middle towns, including Kittuwa, were burned by General [[Griffith Rutherford]], and several of the Overhill towns were burned by [[John Sevier]].  By 1805, the Cherokee had ceded control of the Great Smokies to the U.S. government.  Although much of the tribe was forced west along the [[Trail of Tears]] in 1838, a few\u2014largely through the efforts of [[William Holland Thomas]]\u2014managed to retain their land on the [[Qualla Boundary]] and today comprise the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]].<ref name=\"vicki_rozema\" />\n\nIn the 1780s, several frontier outposts had been established along the outskirts of the Smokies, namely Whitson's Fort in what is now [[Cosby, Tennessee|Cosby]] and Wear's Fort in what is now [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee|Pigeon Forge]].  Permanent settlers began arriving in these areas in the 1790s.  In 1801, the Whaley brothers, [[William Whaley|William]] and John, moved from North Carolina to become the first settlers in what is now the [[Greenbrier (Great Smoky Mountains)|Greenbrier]] section of the park.<ref>Carson Brewer, ''Great Smoky Mountains National Park'' (Portland, Ore.: Graphic Arts Center Publishing, 1993), 18.</ref>  \n\nIn 1802, [[Edgefield, South Carolina]] resident William Ogle (1751\u20131803) arrived in [[White Oak Flats]] where he cut and prepared logs for cabin construction.  Although Ogle died shortly after returning to Edgefield, his wife, [[Martha Jane Huskey]], eventually returned with her family and several other families to White Oak Flats, becoming the first permanent settlers in what would eventually become [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee|Gatlinburg]].  Their children and grandchildren spread out southward into the [[Sugarlands]] and [[Roaring Fork (Great Smoky Mountains)|Roaring Fork]] areas.<ref>Brewer, 18.</ref>  \n\nCades Cove was settled largely by families who had purchased lots from land speculator William \"Fighting Billy\" Tipton.

The average farm consisted of roughly {{convert|50|acre|km2}}, part of which was cultivated and part of which was woodland. Early settlers lived in {{convert|16|ft|m}} x {{convert|20|ft|m}} log cabins, although these were replaced by more elaborate log houses and eventually, as lumber became available, by modern frame houses. Most farms included at least one barn, a [[springhouse]] (used for refrigeration), a [[smokehouse]] (used for curing meat), a [[chicken coop]] (protected chickens from predators), and a [[corn crib]] (kept corn dry and protected it from rodents). Some of the more industrious farmers operated [[gristmill]]s, [[general store]]<nowiki/>s, and [[sorghum]] presses.<ref>Jerry Wear, ''Sugarlands: A Lost Community of Sevier County'' (Sevierville, Tennessee: Sevierville Heritage Committee, 1986), 5\u20136.</ref> Religion was a central theme in the lives of the early residents of the Smokies, and community life was typically centered on churches. Christian [[Protestantism]]\u2014especially [[Primitive Baptists]], [[Missionary Baptists]], [[Methodists]], and [[Presbyterians]]; dominated the religious culture of the region.\n\n===American Civil War===\nWhile both Tennessee and North Carolina joined the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] at the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] sentiment in the Great Smoky Mountains was much stronger relative to other regions in these two states.  Generally, the communities on the Tennessee side of the Smokies supported the Union, while communities on the North Carolina side supported the Confederates.  On the Tennessee side, 74% of Cocke Countians, 80% of Blount Countians, and 96% of Sevier Countians voted against secession.<ref>Eric Lacy, ''Vanquished Volunteers: East Tennessee Sectionalism from Statehood to Secession'' (Johnson City, Tenn.: East Tennessee State University Press, 1965), pp. 217-233.</ref>  In the North Carolina Smokies\u2014[[Cherokee County, North Carolina|Cherokee]], [[Haywood County, North Carolina|Haywood]], [[Jackson County, North Carolina|Jackson]], and [[Macon County, North Carolina|Macon]] counties\u2014about 46% of the population favored secession.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/grsm/learn/historyculture/civil-war-1.htm Civil War Journal: Divided Loyalties], Great Smoky Mountains National Park website. Retrieved: 23 June 2015.</ref>\n\nWhile no major engagements took place in the Smokies, minor skirmishes were fairly common. Cherokee chief [[William Holland Thomas]] formed a Confederate legion made up mostly of Cherokee soldiers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Thomas' Legion crossed the Smokies in 1862 and occupied Gatlinburg for several months to protect [[salt peter]] mines atop Mount Le Conte. Residents of predominantly Union Cades Cove and predominantly Confederate Hazel Creek routinely crossed the mountains to steal one another's livestock.<ref>Oliver, 44-45.</ref> Residents of Cosby and Cataloochee did likewise.  One notable Civil War incident in the Smokies was the murder of long-time Cades Cove resident [[Russell Gregory]] (for whom [[Gregory Bald]] is named), which was carried out by [[bushwhacker]]s in 1864 shortly after Gregory had led an ambush that routed a band of Confederates seeking to wreak havoc in the cove.<ref>Dunn, 135-136.</ref> Another incident was George Kirk's raid on Cataloochee, in which Kirk killed or wounded 15 Union soldiers recovering at a makeshift hospital.<ref>Davis, ''Cataloochee Valley'', 72.</ref>\n\n===Logging===\n[[File:Champion-fibre-plant-canton-nc1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|The Champion Fibre Company plant in [[Canton, North Carolina]], 1910]]\n\nWhile selective logging occurred in the Great Smoky Mountains throughout the 19th century, the general inaccessibility of the range's forests prevented major logging operations, and lumber firms relied on the lowland forests in the northeastern United States and the [[Mississippi Delta]] in the southeast.  As timber resources in these regions became exhausted, and as the demand for lumber skyrocketed after the Civil War, entrepreneurs began looking for ways to reach the virgin forests of Southern Appalachia.  The first logging operations in the Smokies, which began in the 1880s, used [[splash dam]]s or [[log boom|boom]]s to float logs down rivers to lumber mills in nearby cities.  Notable splash dam and boom operations included the [[English Lumber Company]] on Little River, the Taylor and Crate operations along Hazel Creek, and the ambitious operations of [[Alexander Arthur]] on the Pigeon River.  All three of these operations failed within their first few years, however, after their dams and boom systems were destroyed by floods.<ref>Wilma Dykeman, The French Broad (New York: Rinehart, 1955), 167-174.</ref><ref>Vic Weals, ''The Last Train to Elkmont'' (Knoxville: Olden Press, 1993), 1-3.</ref><ref>Oliver, 55-56.</ref>\n\nInnovations in logging railroads and band saw technology in the late 19th century made large-scale logging possible in the mountainous areas of Southern Appalachia.  The largest logging operation in the Smokies was the [[Little River Lumber Company]], which logged the Little River watershed between 1901 and 1939.  The company also established company towns at Townsend (named for the company's chief owner and manager, [[Wilson Townsend|Wilson B. Townsend]]), [[Elkmont, Tennessee|Elkmont]], and [[Tremont, Tennessee|Tremont]].<ref>Weals, 24-28.</ref>  \n\nThe second-largest operation was the Ritter Lumber Company, which logged the Hazel Creek watershed between 1907 and 1928.  Ruins of Ritter's lumbering operations are still visible along the Hazel Creek Trail.<ref>Oliver, 58-64.</ref> Other lumbering operations included [[Three M Lumber]] and [[Champion Fibre]], both of which logged the Oconaluftee watershed.<ref>Michal Strutin, ''History Hikes of the Smokies'' (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 2003), 125, 325.</ref>  By the time all operations ceased in the 1930s, logging firms had removed two-thirds of the virgin forests of the Smokies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===The National Park===\n{{main|Great Smoky Mountains National Park}}\n\nWilson B. Townsend, the head of Little River Lumber, began advertising [[Elkmont, Tennessee|Elkmont]] as a tourist destination in 1909.  Within a few years, the [[Wonderland Hotel]] and the [[Appalachian Club]] had been established to cater to elite Knoxvillians seeking summer mountain getaways.<ref>Weals, 27.</ref> In the early 1920s, several Appalachian Club members, among them Knoxville businessman Colonel [[David C. Chapman|David Chapman]], began seriously considering a movement to establish a national park in the Great Smokies.  As head of the Great Smoky Mountains Park Commission, Chapman was largely responsible for raising funds for land purchases and coordinating park efforts between local, state, and federal entities.<ref>Campbell, 13-18, 32.</ref>\n\nThe creation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park proved much more complex than the creation of its predecessors, such as [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] and [[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite]], which were already federally owned.  Along with convincing logging firms to sell lucrative lumber rights, the Park Commission had to negotiate the purchase of thousands of small farms and remove entire communities.  The commission also had to deal with the Tennessee and North Carolina legislatures, which at times were opposed to spending taxpayer money on park efforts.<ref>Daniel Pierce, ''The Great Smokies: From Natural Habitat to National Park'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2000), 111-120.</ref>  In spite of these difficulties, the Park Commission had completed most major land purchases by 1932.  The national park officially opened in 1934, with President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] presiding over the opening ceremony at [[Newfound Gap]].\n\n==Culture and tourism==\n[[File:SmokyMountainFallLeaves.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The Great Smoky Mountains National Park in autumn]]\n\nThe [[culture]] of the area is that of [[Appalachia|Southern Appalachia]], and previously the [[Cherokee]] people.

They are a subrange of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], and form part of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge Physiographic Province]].  The range is sometimes called the '''Smoky Mountains''' and the name is commonly shortened to the '''Smokies'''.  The Great Smokies are best known as the home of the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]], which protects most of the range.  The park was established in 1934, and, with over 11 million visits per year, it is the most visited national park in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Great Smokies Parkway Top List of Visitors|url=http://www.smliv.com/blog/great-smokies-parkway-top-list-of-visitors/|website=SMLiv.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Great Smokies are part of an [[International Biosphere Reserve]].

The U.S. [[National Park Service]] preserves and maintains [[List of historical structures maintained by the Great Smoky Mountains National Park|78 structures within the national park]] that were once part of the numerous small [[Appalachia]]n communities scattered throughout the range's river valleys and coves.  The park contains five historic districts and nine individual listings on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nThe name \"Smoky\" comes from the natural fog that often hangs over the range and presents as large smoke plumes from a distance.  This fog is caused by the vegetation exhaling [[volatile organic compounds]], chemicals that have a high vapor pressure and easily form vapors at normal temperature and pressure.<ref>Laura Naranjo, \"[http://earthdata.nasa.gov/featured-stories/featured-research/volatile-trees Volatile Trees],\" NASA.gov, 20 November 2011.

The northwestern half of the range gives way to a series of elongate ridges known as the \"Foothills,\" the outermost of which include [[Chilhowee Mountain]] and [[English Mountain]].  The range is roughly bounded on the south by the [[Tuckasegee River]] and to the southeast by Soco Creek and Jonathan Creek.  The Great Smokies comprise parts of [[Blount County, Tennessee|Blount County]], [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]], and [[Cocke County, Tennessee|Cocke County]] in Tennessee and [[Swain County, North Carolina|Swain County]] and [[Haywood County, North Carolina|Haywood County]] in North Carolina.\n\nThe sources of several rivers are located in the Smokies, including the [[Little Pigeon River (Tennessee)|Little Pigeon River]], the [[Oconaluftee River]], and [[Little River (Tennessee)|Little River]].  Streams in the Smokies are part of the [[Tennessee River]] watershed and are thus entirely west of the [[Eastern Continental Divide]].  The largest stream wholly within the park is [[Abrams Creek (Tennessee)|Abrams Creek]], which rises in Cades Cove and empties into the Chilhowee Lake impoundment of the Little Tennessee River near [[Chilhowee Dam]].  \n\nOther major streams include Hazel Creek and Eagle Creek in the southwest, Raven Fork near [[Oconaluftee (Great Smoky Mountains)|Oconaluftee]], Cosby Creek near [[Cosby, Tennessee|Cosby]], and [[Roaring Fork (Great Smoky Mountains)|Roaring Fork]] near [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee|Gatlinburg]].  The Little Tennessee River passes through five impoundments along the range's southwestern boundary, namely [[Tellico Lake]], [[Chilhowee Dam|Chilhowee Lake]], [[Calderwood Dam|Calderwood Lake]], [[Cheoah Dam|Cheoah Lake]], and [[Fontana Lake]].\n\n===Notable peaks===\nThe highest point in the Smokies is [[Clingmans Dome]], which rises to an elevation of {{convert|6643|ft|m}}.  The mountain is the highest in Tennessee and the third highest in the Appalachian range.  Clingmans Dome also has the range's highest [[topographical prominence]] at {{convert|4503|ft|m}}.  [[Mount Le Conte (Tennessee)|Mount Le Conte]] is the ''tallest'' (i.e., from immediate base to summit) mountain in the range, rising {{convert|5301|ft|m}} from its base in Gatlinburg to its {{convert|6593|ft|m|sing=on}} summit.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n!

The Ocoee Supergroup consists primarily of slightly metamorphosed sandstones, phyllites, schists, and slate.  Early Precambrian rocks, which include the oldest rocks in the Smokies, comprise the dominant rock type in the Raven Fork Valley (near [[Oconaluftee (Great Smoky Mountains)|Oconaluftee]]) and lower Tuckasegee River between [[Cherokee, North Carolina|Cherokee]] and [[Bryson City, North Carolina|Bryson City]].  They consist primarily of metamorphic [[gneiss]], [[granite]], and [[schist]].  Cambrian sedimentary rocks are found among the outer reaches of the Foothills to the northwest and in limestone coves such as [[Cades Cove]].<ref>Harry Moore, ''A Roadside Guide to the Geology of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 32.</ref>\n\nThe Precambrian gneiss and schists\u2014the oldest rocks in the Smokies\u2014formed over a billion years ago from the accumulation of marine sediments and igneous rock in a primordial ocean.  In the Late Precambrian period, this ocean expanded, and the more recent Ocoee Supergroup rocks formed from accumulations of the eroding land mass onto the ocean's continental shelf.<ref name=\"houk_10-17\">Houk, 10\u201317.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the [[Paleozoic]] era, the ancient ocean had deposited a thick layer of marine sediments which left behind sedimentary rocks such as limestone.  During the Ordovician period, the North American and African plates collided, destroying the ancient ocean and initiating the [[Alleghenian orogeny]]\u2014the mountain-building epoch that created the Appalachian range.  The Mesozoic era saw the rapid erosion of the softer sedimentary rocks from the new mountains, re-exposing the older Ocoee Supergroup formations.<ref name=\"houk_10-17\" />\n\nAround 20,000 years ago, subarctic glaciers advanced southward across North America, and although they never reached the Smokies, the advancing glaciers led to colder mean annual temperatures and an increase in precipitation throughout the range.  Trees were unable to survive at the higher elevations, and were replaced by [[tundra]] vegetation.  Spruce-fir forests occupied the valleys and slopes below approximately {{convert|4950|ft|m}}.  The persistent freezing and thawing during this period created the large blockfields that are often found at the base of large mountain slopes.<ref name=\"moore_40-44\">Moore, 40-44.</ref> \n\nBetween 16,500 and 12,500 years ago, the glaciers to the north retreated and mean annual temperatures rose.  The tundra vegetation disappeared, and the spruce-fir forests retreated to the highest elevations.  Hardwood trees moved into the region from the coastal plains, replacing the spruce-fir forests in the lower elevations.

About {{convert|10600|acre|km2}} of the spruce-fir forest are old-growth.<ref name = \"OldGrowthEastNC\"/>\n\nThe spruce-fir forest consists primarily of two [[conifer]] species\u2014[[Picea rubens|red spruce]] (''Picea rubens'') and [[Abies fraseri|Fraser fir]] (''Abies fraseri'').   The Fraser Firs, which are native to Southern Appalachia, once dominated elevations above {{convert|6200|ft|m}} in the Great Smokies.  Most of these firs were killed, however, by an infestation of the [[balsam wooly adelgid]], which arrived in the Smokies in the early 1960s.  Thus, red spruce is now the dominant species in the range's spruce-fir forest.  Large stands of dead Fraser Firs remain atop Clingmans Dome and on the northwestern slopes of Old Black.  While much of the red spruce stands in the Smokies were logged during [[World War I]], the tree is still common throughout the range above {{convert|5500|ft|m}}.  Some of the red spruce trees in the Smokies are believed to be 300 years old, and the tallest rise to over {{convert|100|ft|m}}.<ref>Houk, 50-53.</ref>\n\nThe main difference between the spruce-fir forests of Southern Appalachia and the spruce-fir forests in northern latitudes is the dense broad-leaved understory of the former.  The spruce-fir understories of the Smokies are home to [[Rhododendron catawbiense|catawba rhododendron]], [[Sorbus americana|mountain ash]], [[Prunus pensylvanica|pin cherry]], thornless blackberry, and [[Viburnum lantanoides|hobblebush]].  The herbaceous and litter layers of the spruce-fir forests are poorly lit year-round, and are thus dominated by shade-tolerant plants such as ferns, namely [[Dryopteris campyloptera|mountain wood fern]] and [[Athyrium filix-femina|northern lady fern]], and over 280 species of mosses.<ref>Houk, 50, 54-55.</ref>\n\n===Wildflowers===\n{{Main|Wildflowers of the Great Smoky Mountains}}\n\n[[File:Ben-parton-mtn-laurel-tn1.jpg|thumb|[[Rhododendron]] atop the Ben Parton Lookout]]\n\nMany [[wildflower]]s grow in mountains and valleys of the Great Smokies, including [[bee balm]], [[Polygonatum|Solomon's seal]], [[Dutchman's breeches]], various [[trillium]]s, the Dragon's Advocate and even hardy [[orchid]]s.  There are two native species of rhododendron in the area.  The [[Catawba rhododendron]] has purple flowers in May and June, while the [[rhododendron|rosebay rhododendron]] has longer leaves and blooms white or a light pink in June and July.  \n\nThe orange- to sometimes red-flowered and deciduous [[Rhododendron calendulaceum|flame azalea]] closely follows along with the Catawbas.  The closely related [[Kalmia latifolia|mountain laurel]] blooms in between the two, and all of the blooms progress from lower to higher elevations.  The reverse is true in [[autumn]], when nearly bare mountaintops covered in [[Rime (frost)|rime ice]] (frozen fog) can be separated from green [[valley]]s by very bright and varied leaf colors.  The rhododendrons are [[Broadleaf tree|broadleaf]]s, whose leaves droop in order to shed wet and heavy [[snow]]s that come through the region during winter.\n\n==Fauna==\n[[File:Bear-great-smoky-mtns-nps1.jpg|thumb|A black bear in the Great Smokies]]\n\nThe Great Smoky Mountains are home to 66 species of mammals, over 240 species of birds, 43 species of amphibians, 60 species of fish, and 40 species of reptiles.  The range has the densest [[American black bear|black bear]] population east of the Mississippi River.  The black bear has come to symbolize wildlife in the Smokies, and the animal frequently appears on the covers of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park's literature.

The Smokies, along with the Unicois, provided the main bulwark dividing the [[Overhill Cherokee]] villages in modern Tennessee from the Cherokee Middle towns in modern North Carolina.  The Overhill town of [[Chilhowee (Cherokee town)|Chilhowee]] was situated at the confluence of Abrams Creek and the Little Tennessee, and the Overhill town of [[Tallassee (Cherokee town)|Tallassee]] was located just a few miles upstream near modern [[Calderwood, Tennessee|Calderwood]] (both village sites are now under Chilhowee Lake).

The influx of settlers at the end of the [[French and Indian War]] brought conflict with the Cherokee, who still held legal title to much of the land.  When the Cherokee aligned themselves with the British at the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]] in 1776, American forces launched an invasion of Cherokee territory.<ref name=\"vicki_rozema\">Vicki Rozema, ''Footsteps of the Cherokees'' (Winston-Salem: John F.

By 1805, the Cherokee had ceded control of the Great Smokies to the U.S. government.  Although much of the tribe was forced west along the [[Trail of Tears]] in 1838, a few\u2014largely through the efforts of [[William Holland Thomas]]\u2014managed to retain their land on the [[Qualla Boundary]] and today comprise the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]].<ref name=\"vicki_rozema\" />\n\nIn the 1780s, several frontier outposts had been established along the outskirts of the Smokies, namely Whitson's Fort in what is now [[Cosby, Tennessee|Cosby]] and Wear's Fort in what is now [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee|Pigeon Forge]].  Permanent settlers began arriving in these areas in the 1790s.  In 1801, the Whaley brothers, [[William Whaley|William]] and John, moved from North Carolina to become the first settlers in what is now the [[Greenbrier (Great Smoky Mountains)|Greenbrier]] section of the park.<ref>Carson Brewer, ''Great Smoky Mountains National Park'' (Portland, Ore.: Graphic Arts Center Publishing, 1993), 18.</ref>  \n\nIn 1802, [[Edgefield, South Carolina]] resident William Ogle (1751\u20131803) arrived in [[White Oak Flats]] where he cut and prepared logs for cabin construction.

The average farm consisted of roughly {{convert|50|acre|km2}}, part of which was cultivated and part of which was woodland. Early settlers lived in {{convert|16|ft|m}} x {{convert|20|ft|m}} log cabins, although these were replaced by more elaborate log houses and eventually, as lumber became available, by modern frame houses. Most farms included at least one barn, a [[springhouse]] (used for refrigeration), a [[smokehouse]] (used for curing meat), a [[chicken coop]] (protected chickens from predators), and a [[corn crib]] (kept corn dry and protected it from rodents). Some of the more industrious farmers operated [[gristmill]]s, [[general store]]<nowiki/>s, and [[sorghum]] presses.<ref>Jerry Wear, ''Sugarlands: A Lost Community of Sevier County'' (Sevierville, Tennessee: Sevierville Heritage Committee, 1986), 5\u20136.</ref> Religion was a central theme in the lives of the early residents of the Smokies, and community life was typically centered on churches. Christian [[Protestantism]]\u2014especially [[Primitive Baptists]], [[Missionary Baptists]], [[Methodists]], and [[Presbyterians]]; dominated the religious culture of the region.\n\n===American Civil War===\nWhile both Tennessee and North Carolina joined the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] at the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] sentiment in the Great Smoky Mountains was much stronger relative to other regions in these two states.  Generally, the communities on the Tennessee side of the Smokies supported the Union, while communities on the North Carolina side supported the Confederates.  On the Tennessee side, 74% of Cocke Countians, 80% of Blount Countians, and 96% of Sevier Countians voted against secession.<ref>Eric Lacy, ''Vanquished Volunteers: East Tennessee Sectionalism from Statehood to Secession'' (Johnson City, Tenn.: East Tennessee State University Press, 1965), pp. 217-233.</ref>  In the North Carolina Smokies\u2014[[Cherokee County, North Carolina|Cherokee]], [[Haywood County, North Carolina|Haywood]], [[Jackson County, North Carolina|Jackson]], and [[Macon County, North Carolina|Macon]] counties\u2014about 46% of the population favored secession.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/grsm/learn/historyculture/civil-war-1.htm Civil War Journal: Divided Loyalties], Great Smoky Mountains National Park website. Retrieved: 23 June 2015.</ref>\n\nWhile no major engagements took place in the Smokies, minor skirmishes were fairly common. Cherokee chief [[William Holland Thomas]] formed a Confederate legion made up mostly of Cherokee soldiers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Thomas' Legion crossed the Smokies in 1862 and occupied Gatlinburg for several months to protect [[salt peter]] mines atop Mount Le Conte. Residents of predominantly Union Cades Cove and predominantly Confederate Hazel Creek routinely crossed the mountains to steal one another's livestock.<ref>Oliver, 44-45.</ref> Residents of Cosby and Cataloochee did likewise.  One notable Civil War incident in the Smokies was the murder of long-time Cades Cove resident [[Russell Gregory]] (for whom [[Gregory Bald]] is named), which was carried out by [[bushwhacker]]s in 1864 shortly after Gregory had led an ambush that routed a band of Confederates seeking to wreak havoc in the cove.<ref>Dunn, 135-136.</ref> Another incident was George Kirk's raid on Cataloochee, in which Kirk killed or wounded 15 Union soldiers recovering at a makeshift hospital.<ref>Davis, ''Cataloochee Valley'', 72.</ref>\n\n===Logging===\n[[File:Champion-fibre-plant-canton-nc1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|The Champion Fibre Company plant in [[Canton, North Carolina]], 1910]]\n\nWhile selective logging occurred in the Great Smoky Mountains throughout the 19th century, the general inaccessibility of the range's forests prevented major logging operations, and lumber firms relied on the lowland forests in the northeastern United States and the [[Mississippi Delta]] in the southeast.  As timber resources in these regions became exhausted, and as the demand for lumber skyrocketed after the Civil War, entrepreneurs began looking for ways to reach the virgin forests of Southern Appalachia.  The first logging operations in the Smokies, which began in the 1880s, used [[splash dam]]s or [[log boom|boom]]s to float logs down rivers to lumber mills in nearby cities.  Notable splash dam and boom operations included the [[English Lumber Company]] on Little River, the Taylor and Crate operations along Hazel Creek, and the ambitious operations of [[Alexander Arthur]] on the Pigeon River.  All three of these operations failed within their first few years, however, after their dams and boom systems were destroyed by floods.<ref>Wilma Dykeman, The French Broad (New York: Rinehart, 1955), 167-174.</ref><ref>Vic Weals, ''The Last Train to Elkmont'' (Knoxville: Olden Press, 1993), 1-3.</ref><ref>Oliver, 55-56.</ref>\n\nInnovations in logging railroads and band saw technology in the late 19th century made large-scale logging possible in the mountainous areas of Southern Appalachia.  The largest logging operation in the Smokies was the [[Little River Lumber Company]], which logged the Little River watershed between 1901 and 1939.

Townsend, the head of Little River Lumber, began advertising [[Elkmont, Tennessee|Elkmont]] as a tourist destination in 1909.  Within a few years, the [[Wonderland Hotel]] and the [[Appalachian Club]] had been established to cater to elite Knoxvillians seeking summer mountain getaways.<ref>Weals, 27.</ref> In the early 1920s, several Appalachian Club members, among them Knoxville businessman Colonel [[David C. Chapman|David Chapman]], began seriously considering a movement to establish a national park in the Great Smokies.  As head of the Great Smoky Mountains Park Commission, Chapman was largely responsible for raising funds for land purchases and coordinating park efforts between local, state, and federal entities.<ref>Campbell, 13-18, 32.</ref>\n\nThe creation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park proved much more complex than the creation of its predecessors, such as [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] and [[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite]], which were already federally owned.  Along with convincing logging firms to sell lucrative lumber rights, the Park Commission had to negotiate the purchase of thousands of small farms and remove entire communities.  The commission also had to deal with the Tennessee and North Carolina legislatures, which at times were opposed to spending taxpayer money on park efforts.<ref>Daniel Pierce, ''The Great Smokies: From Natural Habitat to National Park'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2000), 111-120.</ref>  In spite of these difficulties, the Park Commission had completed most major land purchases by 1932.  The national park officially opened in 1934, with President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] presiding over the opening ceremony at [[Newfound Gap]].\n\n==Culture and tourism==\n[[File:SmokyMountainFallLeaves.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The Great Smoky Mountains National Park in autumn]]\n\nThe [[culture]] of the area is that of [[Appalachia|Southern Appalachia]], and previously the [[Cherokee]] people.

The first floppy disk advergames were developed to serve dual purposes\u2014as promotional incentives that drive response and as media that deliver awareness. American Home Foods [[Chef Boyardee]] issued one of the earliest floppy-disk advergames.<ref name=\"gamedaily2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/features/dunkin-for-advergames/68443/?biz=1|title=Dunkin' for Advergames|author=Justin Davis|date=2006-01-16|publisher=Gamedaily.com|accessdate=2010-06-23}}</ref> Some brands, like [[Kool-Aid]] and [[Pepsi]], created early advergames on gaming platforms.

Political and military examples of [[Below the line (advertising)|below-the-line]] (BTL) advergames include [[recruitment tool]]s like ''[[America's Army]]'', intended to boost recruitment for the [[United States Army]], and ''[[Special Force (Hezbollah)|Special Force]]'', intended to promote [[Muslim]] resistance to the state of [[Israel]]. Educational advergaming is closely related to the [[Serious game]]s initiative and falls under either [[Serious game#Classifications and subsets of serious games|Edumarket gaming]] or [[edutainment]].

The technique used to tempt the player into visiting the intended URL varies from game to game.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.business2community.com/marketing/everything-need-know-atl-btl-ttl-advertising-01902793|title=Everything You Need to Know About ATL, BTL and TTL Advertising|work=Business 2 Community|access-date=2018-07-04}}</ref> In games like ''[[Pikmin 2]]'', the player is given a cryptic message with an accompanying URL designed to pique the curiosity of the player. In games such as ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'', ''[[Year Zero (game)|Year Zero]]'', ''[[I Love Bees]]'', and ''[[Lost Experience]]'', URLs make up a part of the background of the game such that certain plot details can only be learned by following the link given in the game. The knowledge of such plot details are typically not required to complete the game, but make for a fuller story for fans. Websites of this nature often lead players on to other links which again lead to further links, thus earning these games the label \"link-chases.\" The tradeoff for TTL advertisers is that though use of the internet to find out extra things about a game might be enjoyable, gamers will not enjoy being given too much of a run-around with too obtrusive advertising to obtain important details about the game.

Political and military examples of [[Below the line (advertising)|below-the-line]] (BTL) advergames include [[recruitment tool]]s like ''[[America's Army]]'', intended to boost recruitment for the [[United States Army]], and ''[[Special Force (Hezbollah)|Special Force]]'', intended to promote [[Muslim]] resistance to the state of [[Israel]]. Educational advergaming is closely related to the [[Serious game]]s initiative and falls under either [[Serious game#Classifications and subsets of serious games|Edumarket gaming]] or [[edutainment]].

In games such as ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'', ''[[Year Zero (game)|Year Zero]]'', ''[[I Love Bees]]'', and ''[[Lost Experience]]'', URLs make up a part of the background of the game such that certain plot details can only be learned by following the link given in the game. The knowledge of such plot details are typically not required to complete the game, but make for a fuller story for fans. Websites of this nature often lead players on to other links which again lead to further links, thus earning these games the label \"link-chases.\" The tradeoff for TTL advertisers is that though use of the internet to find out extra things about a game might be enjoyable, gamers will not enjoy being given too much of a run-around with too obtrusive advertising to obtain important details about the game. In another form, the URL might be  part of a stage where a player can see it but it does not affect the plot. For example, in Super Monkey Ball 2, there is a stage where you can see clearly written on an obstacle a URL and the stage's name is even the word URL.\n\n== Industry impact ==\n\n=== Prevalence and efficacy ===\nIn 2019, a survey conducted by [[deltaDNA]] found that 94% of free-to-play video game developers incorporate some form of in-game advertising.<ref name=\":23\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pocketgamer.biz/data-and-research/72228/deltadna-in-game-advertising-study-2019/|title=94% of mobile devs use ads in their free-to-play games: deltaDNA's in-game advertising study 2019|last=|first=|date=|website=Pocket Gamer|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> Among those, the most common type of advertisement were rewarded videos, which are videos that players can watch to earn in-game prizes.<ref name=\":23\" /> Rewarded videos are shown to be more effective than forced advertising; players are 23% more likely to buy products and 18% more likely to make in-app purchases when shown rewarded videos instead of forced advertising.<ref name=\":24\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/audiencenetwork/news-and-insights/how-do-gamers-feel-about-advertising|title=Game On: How do gamers feel about advertising?|last=Zins|first=Amelia|date=2017-08-22|website=facebook|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> \n\nThe reaction to in-game advertising has been overall positive, with 73% of players being happy with ad-funded games.<ref name=\":24\" />\n\nThe effectiveness of advertising in video games is debated by scholars.<ref name=\":26\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=The Effectiveness of \"in-Game\" Advertising: Comparing College Students' Explicit and Implicit Memory for Brand Names|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2753/JOA0091-3367350410?journalCode=ujoa20|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":27\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Player performance and in game advertising retention|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220982765_Player_performance_and_in_game_advertising_retention|journal=Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Advances in Computer Entertainment Technology|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":28\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Exploring Player Responses towards In-Game Advertising: The Impact of Interactivity|url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8511151/file/8551807.pdf|journal=Ghent University Academic Bibliography|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Brand name recognition in sports game has been shown to be low among college students, although players did retain fragments of the brand names.<ref name=\":26\" /> Another study found that 35% of players could recall advertised brands in car racing games.<ref name=\":27\" /> Interactive in-game advertisements, such as brand products that are used in game, are shown to produce greater brand awareness and more positive brand attitudes than passively added advertisements, such as posters or billboards.<ref name=\":28\" />\n\n=== Mobile ===\nMobile in-game advertisements are [[Advertising|advertisements]] within [[Mobile game|mobile games]] that lead the user to the website or installation page of the advertised product or software upon being clicked.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mobile-advertising.asp|title=What Is Mobile Advertising?|last=Kenton|first=Will|website=Investopedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Mobile gaming advertisements can take different forms, including [[banner ads]], [[Pop-up ad|pop-up ads]], [[Video advertising|video ads]], and interactive ads.

A rare factory option (actually fitted by Works Service prior to customer delivery) was a steel removable hard top.\n\nFrom October 1965 to October 1966, Aston Martin used the last 37 of the Aston Martin DB5 chassis' to make another convertible model. These 37 cars were known as \"[[Aston Martin Short Chassis Volante|Short Chassis]]\" Volantes and were the first Aston Martins to hold the \"Volante\" name. Although calling it a \"Short Chassis\" is a bit of a misnomer as the \"short\" comes from comparing it to the subsequent DB6, which has a longer chassis. When compared to the DB5, it is not \"short\" but rather the same size, however these cars differ to the DB5 convertible models as they feature [[Aston Martin DB6|DB6]] split front and rear bumpers and rear [[Triumph TR4|TR4]] lights, as also used on the DB6.\n\n===DB5 shooting-brake===\n[[File:Aston Martin DB5 Shooting Brake.jpg|thumb|DB5 shooting-brake]]\nA prototype DB5 [[shooting-brake]] was custom produced by the factory for [[David Brown (entrepreneur)|David Brown]], an avid hunter and dog owner, and a further 11-12 coup\u00e9s were custom modified for Aston Martin by independent [[coachbuilder]], [[Harold Radford]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Enthusiasts' Guide to Buying a Classic British Sports Car |first=Peter |last=Hingston |isbn=0-906555-25-6 |year=2008 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SmhWHBhKKswC&pg=PA30}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Aston Martin: Power, Beauty and Soul |first=David |last=Dowsey |page=101 |isbn=0-9578759-5-9 |year=2007 |publisher=Images Publishing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u8uJavsDR38C&pg=PA101}}</ref> The taillights used were Triumph units, and were also adopted for the succeeding DB6.

As such, it has reappeared in subsequent films over the years. Within the universe of James Bond, the same car (registration BMT 216A) was used again in the following film, ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', a year later.\n\nA different Aston Martin DB5 (registration BMT 214A) was used in the 1995 Bond film ''[[GoldenEye]]'', in which the car is Bond's personal vehicle and has no gadgets. Although it did come equipped with a champagne cooler in the arm rest and a fax machine. Three different DB5s were used for filming. This same car briefly reappeared in the next film, ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' (1997), and was set to make a cameo appearance in the [[Scotland]]-set scenes in ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' (1999), but these were cut in the final edit. Yet another DB5 (registration 56526) appeared in ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (2006), this time owned by the villain, Alex Dimitrios. This car has [[The Bahamas|Bahamian]] number plates and left-hand drive (where the previous British versions had been right-hand drive). In the film Bond wins the car from Dimitrios after beating him in a card game.\n\nThe ''Goldeneye'' DB5 currently resides at the [[London Film Museum]] in Covent Garden. Of the three cars used in the production, one car was filmed for the static ocean side shot, one's participation is unknown, and DB5/1885/R was driven in the chase scene against the Ferrari in Monte Carlo. DB5/1885/R was bought at a Christies auction in 2001 and entered the Guinness Book of Records that year for the highest paid for a Bond memorabilia. It was first exhibited at the Bond exhibition at Beaulieu before moving to its new home in The London Film Museum.\n\nAnother silver-birch DB5 with the original registration BMT 216A was used in the 23rd James Bond film, ''[[Skyfall]]'', during the 50th anniversary of the release of the first James Bond film ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962).<ref name=\"yimg\">{{cite web |url=http://l.yimg.com/os/286/2012/02/01/skyfall-jpg_105908.jpg |title=Image: DB5 in Skyfall |website=Yimg.com |accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref> It is unclear if this car is meant to be the same one Bond won in ''Casino Royale'', refitted with British number plates, right-hand drive, and gadgets. The car is destroyed in the film's climactic finale. It is seen again in ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' (2015), firstly in Q's underground workshop in various stages of rebuild, and at the film's ending, fully rebuilt, with Bond driving away with it.\n\nOn 1 June 2010, [[RM Auctions]] announced the upcoming auction of a DB5 used in both ''Goldfinger'' and ''Thunderball''.

The car in question was the original Chassis DP/216/1 DB5, with the registration BMT 216A, used in ''Goldfinger''. The episode was filmed before ''Goldfinger'', when the car was still painted in its original dark red coat. The Chassis DP/216/1 DB5 also appeared in the film ''[[The Cannonball Run (film)|The Cannonball Run]]'' (1981), in which it was again driven by Moore (although he did not drive the car during his Bond tenure). In the film, Moore plays Seymour Goldfarb, Jr, a man who believes himself to be Roger Moore, who participates in a madcap, cross-country road race. Since its appearance in ''Goldfinger'', the car had been stripped of its gadgets and re-registered as a regular road car. The car appears with its new registration number, 6633PP, and replica gadgets that were fitted to the car for the film.\n\nThe 1983 reunion telefilm ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.|The Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.: The Fifteen Years Later Affair]]'' includes a brief cameo by [[George Lazenby]] as \"JB\", a white-tuxedoed British man shown driving a DB5, who assists [[Napoleon Solo]] during a car chase. \"It's just like ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'',\" enthuses a female character at the conclusion of the cameo. This special came out in 1983, the same year as ''[[Octopussy]]'' and ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' were released.\n\nIt appears in several video games such as ''[[007 Racing]]'', ''[[Driver San Francisco]]'' (Deluxe Edition), ''[[James Bond 007: Agent Under Fire]]'', ''[[From Russia with Love (video game)|From Russia with Love]]'', and ''[[James Bond 007: Blood Stone]]''. The film, ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' was released in 1963, one year before ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (in which the DB5 was first used), but the video game used the car.\n\nIt appeared in animated form in ''[[James Bond Jr.]]'' in the very first episode \"The Beginning\". In the episode it was able to transform into a plane and could be driven by remote control. The car was destroyed in a plane crash and was recycled into a red sports car, which the PAL VHS cover identifies as the \"Aston Martin Super\".\n\nA version of the car appeared in'' [[Grand Theft Auto: London 1969]]'', being called a \"James Bomb\".\n\n[[Leonardo DiCaprio]] was seen driving the car in ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' (2002) imitating Bond (even down to the suit) in ''Goldfinger'', during a scene which takes place the year the film was released. It also appeared in the action comedy film ''[[Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle]]'' (2003), driven by [[Bernie Mac|Bernie Mac's]] character, Jimmy Bosley. It is only seen once in which Bosley is driving a witness, Max Petroni (portrayed by [[Shia LaBeouf]]) to his mother's house, to be safe from the O'Grady Crime Syndicate.\n\nThe French spy comedy film, ''Double Z\u00e9ro'' (2004) directed by [[G\u00e9rard Pir\u00e8s]] also featured a DB5. It can be seen once in the film, when the two main characters go to meet the parody of [[Q (James Bond)|Q]].\n \nAn Aston Martin DB5 appeared in heavily stylized form as \"Finn McMissile\", a British secret agent voiced by [[Michael Caine]] in the [[Pixar]] film ''[[Cars 2]]'' (2011). The car character was a homage to the Bond DB5, although it also bore a resemblance to the [[Volvo P1800]], as used by the fictional British secret agent [[Simon Templar]] in ''The Saint'' television series.\n\nThe car appeared in ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Flies Again]]'', a sequel to Fleming's novel by [[Frank Cottrell-Boyce]], which was published in 2011. In the book, it is heavily implied that the car had belonged to James Bond.\n\nIn 2013, ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' featured a car called the \"JB 700\" that is based on the DB5; In the game's story mode, the player must steal one equipped with numerous gadgets \u2013 including caltrops and functional machine guns mounted to the car's front wings \u2013 from a film set.\n\n''[[Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2012 video game)|Need for Speed: Most Wanted]]'' released a DLC named'' \"Movie Legends\"'' that featured the car.\n\nThe music video for the [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher song]] \"[[Burn (Usher song)|Burn]]\" features a DB5. The same car with the same registration number appears a number of times in the short lived TV series [[Fastlane (TV series)|Fastlane]].\n\nIn the 2015 TV series ''[[Thunderbirds Are Go (TV series)|Thunderbirds Are Go]]'' a DB5 can be seen as Lady Penelope gets into Fab 1 in the first episode \"Ring Of Fire\".\n\nThe DB5 appears in yet another racing game entitled ''[[Forza Horizon 4]]'' as part of the James Bond DLC pack. The gadgets used in ''Goldfinger'' can be seen in its showcase mode.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of James Bond vehicles]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*{{Cite book |last1=Pfeiffer |first1=Lee |last2=Worrall |first2=Dave |title=The Essential Bond |year=1998 |publisher=Boxtree Ltd |location=London |isbn=978-0-75222-477-0 |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Bouzereau |first=Laurent |title=The Art of Bond |year=2006 |publisher=Boxtree Ltd |location=London |isbn=978-0-75221-551-8 |ref=harv}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Aston Martin DB5}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928022627/http://www.objectbook.com/aston-martin.html |title=Aston Martin DB5 |website=Objectbook}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.imcdb.org/vehicles.php?make=Aston+Martin+&model=db5 |title=Aston Martin DB5 |website=[[Internet Movie Cars Database]]}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904140838/http://www.aston.co.uk/brochures/files/DB5c.pdf |title=An original sales brochure for the DB5 |website=Aston.co.uk}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904140533/http://www.aston.co.uk/brochures/files/DB5b.pdf |title=Period DB5 sales literature and specification brochure |website=Aston.co.uk}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904140410/http://www.aston.co.uk/brochures/files/DB5a.pdf |title=Period original 1964 DB5 sales brochure |website=Aston.co.uk}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904140118/http://www.aston.co.uk/brochures/files/DB5%2BSpecs.pdf |title=1964 Aston Martin DB5 saloon/convertible full specification |website=Aston.co.uk}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904140201/http://www.aston.co.uk/brochures/files/DB5%2Bprices%2Band%2Bterms.pdf |title=Full 1964 DB5 price list |website=Aston.co.uk}}\n<div style=\"overflow:auto;\">\n{{Aston Martin}}\n</div>\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aston Martin Db5}}\n[[Category:Aston Martin vehicles|DB5]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1963]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Convertibles]]\n[[Category:Station wagons]]\n[[Category:Grand tourers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date=June 2011}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Aston Martin DB5\n| image = Aston Martin DB5 (Skyfall).jpg\n| manufacturer = [[Aston Martin]]\n| production = 1963\u20131965 (1,059 units)\n| designer = [[Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera]]\n| class = [[Grand tourer]]\n| body_style = 2-door 2+2 [[coup\u00e9]]<br />2-door [[Convertible (car)|convertible]] (123)<br />2-door [[shooting brake]] (13)<ref name=\"AMsb\">{{cite web |url=http://www.astonmartins.com/db4_5_6_s/db5_radford_shooting_brake.htm |title=Aston Martin DB5 Shooting Brake by Harold Radford (1965\u20131967) |last=Cottingham |first=Tim |date=9 July 2008 |website=Aston Martins.com |access-date=7 October 2019}}</ref>\n| layout = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive]]\n| engine = [[DOHC]] [[Straight-6]], {{convert|3995|cc|L|1|order=flip|abbr=on}}\n| powerout = {{convert|282-325|bhp|0|abbr=on}} @ 5500 rpm<br/>{{convert|280-288|lbft|0|abbr=on}} @ 4500 rpm\n| transmission = 5-speed [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] box or optional [[BorgWarner]] 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| length = {{convert|4.57|m|in|1}}\n| width = {{convert|1.68|m|in|1}}\n| predecessor = [[Aston Martin DB4]]\n| successor = [[Aston Martin DB6]]\n| doors = 2\n| weight = {{convert|3311|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n| sp = uk\n}}\nThe '''Aston Martin DB5''' is a British luxury [[grand tourer]] (GT) that was made by [[Aston Martin]] and designed by the Italian coachbuilder [[Carrozzeria Touring|Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera]].<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.evo.co.uk/aston-martin/9656/birth-of-an-icon-1963-aston-martin-db5 |title=Birth of an icon: 1963: Aston Martin DB5 |first=Ian |last=Eveleigh |date=16 December 2008 |magazine=[[Evo (magazine)|Evo]] |access-date=24 April 2018 |language=en}}</ref> Released in 1963, it was an evolution of the final series of [[Aston Martin DB4|DB4]]. \n\nAlthough not the first in the ''DB'' series, the DB5 is the best-known cinematic [[List of James Bond vehicles|''James Bond'' car]], first appearing in the ''[[James Bond in film|James Bond]]'' film ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (1964).<ref name=\"mi6\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/q-branch/astonmartindb5.php3 |title=Aston Martin DB5 |website=MI6: The Home of James Bond 007 |accessdate=27 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108082013/http://www.mi6.co.uk///sections/q-branch/astonmartindb5.php3 |archive-date=8 January 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\nThe principal differences between the DB4 Series V and the DB5 are the all-aluminium engine, enlarged from 3.7&nbsp;L to 4.0&nbsp;L;

A rare factory option (actually fitted by Works Service prior to customer delivery) was a steel removable hard top.\n\nFrom October 1965 to October 1966, Aston Martin used the last 37 of the Aston Martin DB5 chassis' to make another convertible model. These 37 cars were known as \"[[Aston Martin Short Chassis Volante|Short Chassis]]\" Volantes and were the first Aston Martins to hold the \"Volante\" name. Although calling it a \"Short Chassis\" is a bit of a misnomer as the \"short\" comes from comparing it to the subsequent DB6, which has a longer chassis. When compared to the DB5, it is not \"short\" but rather the same size, however these cars differ to the DB5 convertible models as they feature [[Aston Martin DB6|DB6]] split front and rear bumpers and rear [[Triumph TR4|TR4]] lights, as also used on the DB6.\n\n===DB5 shooting-brake===\n[[File:Aston Martin DB5 Shooting Brake.jpg|thumb|DB5 shooting-brake]]\nA prototype DB5 [[shooting-brake]] was custom produced by the factory for [[David Brown (entrepreneur)|David Brown]], an avid hunter and dog owner, and a further 11-12 coup\u00e9s were custom modified for Aston Martin by independent [[coachbuilder]], [[Harold Radford]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Enthusiasts' Guide to Buying a Classic British Sports Car |first=Peter |last=Hingston |isbn=0-906555-25-6 |year=2008 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SmhWHBhKKswC&pg=PA30}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Aston Martin: Power, Beauty and Soul |first=David |last=Dowsey |page=101 |isbn=0-9578759-5-9 |year=2007 |publisher=Images Publishing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u8uJavsDR38C&pg=PA101}}</ref> The taillights used were Triumph units, and were also adopted for the succeeding DB6.

As such, it has reappeared in subsequent films over the years. Within the universe of James Bond, the same car (registration BMT 216A) was used again in the following film, ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', a year later.\n\nA different Aston Martin DB5 (registration BMT 214A) was used in the 1995 Bond film ''[[GoldenEye]]'', in which the car is Bond's personal vehicle and has no gadgets. Although it did come equipped with a champagne cooler in the arm rest and a fax machine. Three different DB5s were used for filming. This same car briefly reappeared in the next film, ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' (1997), and was set to make a cameo appearance in the [[Scotland]]-set scenes in ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' (1999), but these were cut in the final edit. Yet another DB5 (registration 56526) appeared in ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (2006), this time owned by the villain, Alex Dimitrios. This car has [[The Bahamas|Bahamian]] number plates and left-hand drive (where the previous British versions had been right-hand drive). In the film Bond wins the car from Dimitrios after beating him in a card game.\n\nThe ''Goldeneye'' DB5 currently resides at the [[London Film Museum]] in Covent Garden. Of the three cars used in the production, one car was filmed for the static ocean side shot, one's participation is unknown, and DB5/1885/R was driven in the chase scene against the Ferrari in Monte Carlo. DB5/1885/R was bought at a Christies auction in 2001 and entered the Guinness Book of Records that year for the highest paid for a Bond memorabilia. It was first exhibited at the Bond exhibition at Beaulieu before moving to its new home in The London Film Museum.\n\nAnother silver-birch DB5 with the original registration BMT 216A was used in the 23rd James Bond film, ''[[Skyfall]]'', during the 50th anniversary of the release of the first James Bond film ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962).<ref name=\"yimg\">{{cite web |url=http://l.yimg.com/os/286/2012/02/01/skyfall-jpg_105908.jpg |title=Image: DB5 in Skyfall |website=Yimg.com |accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref> It is unclear if this car is meant to be the same one Bond won in ''Casino Royale'', refitted with British number plates, right-hand drive, and gadgets. The car is destroyed in the film's climactic finale. It is seen again in ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' (2015), firstly in Q's underground workshop in various stages of rebuild, and at the film's ending, fully rebuilt, with Bond driving away with it.\n\nOn 1 June 2010, [[RM Auctions]] announced the upcoming auction of a DB5 used in both ''Goldfinger'' and ''Thunderball''.

The car in question was the original Chassis DP/216/1 DB5, with the registration BMT 216A, used in ''Goldfinger''. The episode was filmed before ''Goldfinger'', when the car was still painted in its original dark red coat. The Chassis DP/216/1 DB5 also appeared in the film ''[[The Cannonball Run (film)|The Cannonball Run]]'' (1981), in which it was again driven by Moore (although he did not drive the car during his Bond tenure). In the film, Moore plays Seymour Goldfarb, Jr, a man who believes himself to be Roger Moore, who participates in a madcap, cross-country road race. Since its appearance in ''Goldfinger'', the car had been stripped of its gadgets and re-registered as a regular road car. The car appears with its new registration number, 6633PP, and replica gadgets that were fitted to the car for the film.\n\nThe 1983 reunion telefilm ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.|The Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.: The Fifteen Years Later Affair]]'' includes a brief cameo by [[George Lazenby]] as \"JB\", a white-tuxedoed British man shown driving a DB5, who assists [[Napoleon Solo]] during a car chase. \"It's just like ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'',\" enthuses a female character at the conclusion of the cameo. This special came out in 1983, the same year as ''[[Octopussy]]'' and ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' were released.\n\nIt appears in several video games such as ''[[007 Racing]]'', ''[[Driver San Francisco]]'' (Deluxe Edition), ''[[James Bond 007: Agent Under Fire]]'', ''[[From Russia with Love (video game)|From Russia with Love]]'', and ''[[James Bond 007: Blood Stone]]''. The film, ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' was released in 1963, one year before ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (in which the DB5 was first used), but the video game used the car.\n\nIt appeared in animated form in ''[[James Bond Jr.]]'' in the very first episode \"The Beginning\". In the episode it was able to transform into a plane and could be driven by remote control. The car was destroyed in a plane crash and was recycled into a red sports car, which the PAL VHS cover identifies as the \"Aston Martin Super\".\n\nA version of the car appeared in'' [[Grand Theft Auto: London 1969]]'', being called a \"James Bomb\".\n\n[[Leonardo DiCaprio]] was seen driving the car in ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' (2002) imitating Bond (even down to the suit) in ''Goldfinger'', during a scene which takes place the year the film was released. It also appeared in the action comedy film ''[[Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle]]'' (2003), driven by [[Bernie Mac|Bernie Mac's]] character, Jimmy Bosley. It is only seen once in which Bosley is driving a witness, Max Petroni (portrayed by [[Shia LaBeouf]]) to his mother's house, to be safe from the O'Grady Crime Syndicate.\n\nThe French spy comedy film, ''Double Z\u00e9ro'' (2004) directed by [[G\u00e9rard Pir\u00e8s]] also featured a DB5. It can be seen once in the film, when the two main characters go to meet the parody of [[Q (James Bond)|Q]].\n \nAn Aston Martin DB5 appeared in heavily stylized form as \"Finn McMissile\", a British secret agent voiced by [[Michael Caine]] in the [[Pixar]] film ''[[Cars 2]]'' (2011). The car character was a homage to the Bond DB5, although it also bore a resemblance to the [[Volvo P1800]], as used by the fictional British secret agent [[Simon Templar]] in ''The Saint'' television series.\n\nThe car appeared in ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Flies Again]]'', a sequel to Fleming's novel by [[Frank Cottrell-Boyce]], which was published in 2011. In the book, it is heavily implied that the car had belonged to James Bond.\n\nIn 2013, ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' featured a car called the \"JB 700\" that is based on the DB5; In the game's story mode, the player must steal one equipped with numerous gadgets \u2013 including caltrops and functional machine guns mounted to the car's front wings \u2013 from a film set.\n\n''[[Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2012 video game)|Need for Speed: Most Wanted]]'' released a DLC named'' \"Movie Legends\"'' that featured the car.\n\nThe music video for the [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher song]] \"[[Burn (Usher song)|Burn]]\" features a DB5. The same car with the same registration number appears a number of times in the short lived TV series [[Fastlane (TV series)|Fastlane]].\n\nIn the 2015 TV series ''[[Thunderbirds Are Go (TV series)|Thunderbirds Are Go]]'' a DB5 can be seen as Lady Penelope gets into Fab 1 in the first episode \"Ring Of Fire\".\n\nThe DB5 appears in yet another racing game entitled ''[[Forza Horizon 4]]'' as part of the James Bond DLC pack. The gadgets used in ''Goldfinger'' can be seen in its showcase mode.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of James Bond vehicles]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*{{Cite book |last1=Pfeiffer |first1=Lee |last2=Worrall |first2=Dave |title=The Essential Bond |year=1998 |publisher=Boxtree Ltd |location=London |isbn=978-0-75222-477-0 |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Bouzereau |first=Laurent |title=The Art of Bond |year=2006 |publisher=Boxtree Ltd |location=London |isbn=978-0-75221-551-8 |ref=harv}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Aston Martin DB5}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928022627/http://www.objectbook.com/aston-martin.html |title=Aston Martin DB5 |website=Objectbook}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.imcdb.org/vehicles.php?make=Aston+Martin+&model=db5 |title=Aston Martin DB5 |website=[[Internet Movie Cars Database]]}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904140838/http://www.aston.co.uk/brochures/files/DB5c.pdf |title=An original sales brochure for the DB5 |website=Aston.co.uk}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904140533/http://www.aston.co.uk/brochures/files/DB5b.pdf |title=Period DB5 sales literature and specification brochure |website=Aston.co.uk}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904140410/http://www.aston.co.uk/brochures/files/DB5a.pdf |title=Period original 1964 DB5 sales brochure |website=Aston.co.uk}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904140118/http://www.aston.co.uk/brochures/files/DB5%2BSpecs.pdf |title=1964 Aston Martin DB5 saloon/convertible full specification |website=Aston.co.uk}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904140201/http://www.aston.co.uk/brochures/files/DB5%2Bprices%2Band%2Bterms.pdf |title=Full 1964 DB5 price list |website=Aston.co.uk}}\n<div style=\"overflow:auto;\">\n{{Aston Martin}}\n</div>\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aston Martin Db5}}\n[[Category:Aston Martin vehicles|DB5]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1963]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Convertibles]]\n[[Category:Station wagons]]\n[[Category:Grand tourers]]\n", "name_user": "2a02:c7f:4c6f:c200:d41b:e0e2:4d95:a071", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Martin_DB5"}

Rhythm guitarist Luke Hemmings said he felt like the [[Youngblood (5 Seconds of Summer album)|last album]] was \"pretty heavy and dark [...] Whereas this one has that side of it with the lighter side of life and moving forward rather than being stuck in one place\".<ref name=\"Herald & Review\">{{Cite web|url=https://herald-review.com/people/seconds-of-summer-inspired-by-industrial-music-on-new-album/article_1d9b84ed-b3e0-523e-b7c0-6a03c68ae855.html|title=5 Seconds of Summer inspired by industrial music on new album CALM|work=[[Herald & Review]]|date=23 March 2020|accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref> The band's bassist Calum Hood said most of the credit is owed to vocalist Luke Hemmings, whose lyrics, Hood said, \"tell the tale of a man who has matured over the years and who has really honed in on his craft\".

The song contains light bass vibration from bassist Calum Hood. The song's theme is about \"contentment and falling in love\", which Parreira noted sets the album's tone. Track 2, \"No Shame\" features a \"retro [[1980s in music|'80s pop]] vibe\", layered with \"explosive instrumentals over meaningful lyrics and raw stories\". Hemmings delivers high notes on the song. \"Old Me\", lyrically reflects on past mistakes, and is a high-energy \"dance anthem\". [[Easier (5 Seconds of Summer song)|\"Easier\"]], released as the album's lead single, has a conversational tone, with \"mellow\" electro instrumentation. Second single [[Teeth (5 Seconds of Summer song)|\"Teeth\"]], is a [[grunge|grungy]], rock-tinged song, with an energetic, catchy chorus. Wildflower\", similarly to \"No Shame\", is reminiscent of '80s pop, consisting of a \"[[The Beach Boys|Beach Boys]]-like vocal chant before a rise in bass and [[synth-pop|synth]] undertones set a romantic tone on the verses\". \"Best Years\" move at a slower pace, albeit containing a \"danceable vibe\". The piano-led \"Lover of Mine\" features intertwining guitar strumming patterns and \"powerful vocal styles\". \"Thin White Lies\" is an \"angst-ridden\" dance-esque track, with \"strong electric beats\". The album concludes with the slow-burner \"Lonely Heart\" and the self-reflcetive \"High\", both ballads, with slightly energetic production, marking a \"calm end\" to the album.\n\nSources:<ref name=\"Riff Mag\">{{Cite web|url=https://riffmagazine.com/album-reviews/5-seconds-of-summer-5sos-calm/|title=Album review: 5 Seconds of Summer bring high energy to 'CALM'|work=Riff magazine|last=Parreria|first=Amelia|date=27 March 2020|accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Gigwise\" />\n\n==Singles==\nThe album's lead single, \"[[Easier (5 Seconds of Summer song)|Easier]]\", was released via [[Interscope Records|Interscope]] on 23 May 2019.

Drummer Ashton Irwin explained: \"As far as [[acoustics|sonic]] inspirations go, we always try to incorporate some of what everyone is actually listening to so it's a more genuine and influenced record that we can speak on.\" The album contains a \"lighter\" sound in comparison to the band's previous work. Rhythm guitarist Luke Hemmings said he felt like the [[Youngblood (5 Seconds of Summer album)|last album]] was \"pretty heavy and dark [...] Whereas this one has that side of it with the lighter side of life and moving forward rather than being stuck in one place\".<ref name=\"Herald & Review\">{{Cite web|url=https://herald-review.com/people/seconds-of-summer-inspired-by-industrial-music-on-new-album/article_1d9b84ed-b3e0-523e-b7c0-6a03c68ae855.html|title=5 Seconds of Summer inspired by industrial music on new album CALM|work=[[Herald & Review]]|date=23 March 2020|accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref> The band's bassist Calum Hood said most of the credit is owed to vocalist Luke Hemmings, whose lyrics, Hood said, \"tell the tale of a man who has matured over the years and who has really honed in on his craft\".

The song contains light bass vibration from bassist Calum Hood. The song's theme is about \"contentment and falling in love\", which Parreira noted sets the album's tone. Track 2, \"No Shame\" features a \"retro [[1980s in music|'80s pop]] vibe\", layered with \"explosive instrumentals over meaningful lyrics and raw stories\". Hemmings delivers high notes on the song. \"Old Me\", lyrically reflects on past mistakes, and is a high-energy \"dance anthem\". [[Easier (5 Seconds of Summer song)|\"Easier\"]], released as the album's lead single, has a conversational tone, with \"mellow\" electro instrumentation. Second single [[Teeth (5 Seconds of Summer song)|\"Teeth\"]], is a [[grunge|grungy]], rock-tinged song, with an energetic, catchy chorus. Wildflower\", similarly to \"No Shame\", is reminiscent of '80s pop, consisting of a \"[[The Beach Boys|Beach Boys]]-like vocal chant before a rise in bass and [[synth-pop|synth]] undertones set a romantic tone on the verses\". \"Best Years\" move at a slower pace, albeit containing a \"danceable vibe\". The piano-led \"Lover of Mine\" features intertwining guitar strumming patterns and \"powerful vocal styles\". \"Thin White Lies\" is an \"angst-ridden\" dance-esque track, with \"strong electric beats\". The album concludes with the slow-burner \"Lonely Heart\" and the self-reflcetive \"High\", both ballads, with slightly energetic production, marking a \"calm end\" to the album.\n\nSources:<ref name=\"Riff Mag\">{{Cite web|url=https://riffmagazine.com/album-reviews/5-seconds-of-summer-5sos-calm/|title=Album review: 5 Seconds of Summer bring high energy to 'CALM'|work=Riff magazine|last=Parreria|first=Amelia|date=27 March 2020|accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Gigwise\" />\n\n==Singles==\nThe album's lead single, \"[[Easier (5 Seconds of Summer song)|Easier]]\", was released via [[Interscope Records|Interscope]] on 23 May 2019.
