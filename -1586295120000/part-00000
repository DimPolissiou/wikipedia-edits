He left in 1952 to work for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic National Committee]] on Adlai Stevenson's presidential campaign. He returned to journalism at the ''[[Washington Daily News]]'', an afternoon tabloid. He wrote a series of articles on the case of [[Abraham Chasanow]], a civilian employee of the U.S. Navy, who had been dismissed from his job on the basis of allegations by anonymous informers that he associated with anti-American subversives. The series won Lewis a [[Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting]] in 1955.<ref>{{cite web|title=1955 Winners|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1955|publisher=Pulitzer Prizes|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nLewis returned to ''The New York Times'' that year as its Washington bureau chief. He was assigned to cover the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. In 1956\u201357 he was a [[Nieman Fellowship|Nieman Fellow]] at [[Harvard Law School]].<ref name=nytobit/> He won a second Pulitzer Prize in 1963, again in the category National Reporting, for his coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court.<ref>{{cite web|title=1963 Winners|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1963|publisher=Pulitzer Prizes|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref> The citation singled out his coverage of the court's reasoning in ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'', a Supreme Court decision that held the federal courts could exercise authority over legislative redistricting on the part of the states, and the decision's impact on specific states.<ref name=nytobit/>\n\nIn his 1969 history of ''The New York Times'', [[Gay Talese]] described Lewis in his Washington years as \"cool, lean, well-scrubbed looking, intense and brilliant\".<ref name=nytobit/> Lewis became a member of Senator [[Robert Kennedy]]'s social circle, too conspicuously so in the opinion of [[Max Frankel]], another of the paper's editors.<ref name=nytobit/>\n\nDuring a four-month newspaper strike (November 1962 to February 1963), Lewis wrote ''[[Gideon's Trumpet]]'', the story of [[Clarence Earl Gideon]], the plaintiff in ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'', the 1963 case in which the Supreme Court held that states were required to provide counsel for indigent defendants charged with serious crimes. At Lewis' death it had not been out of print since it was first published.<ref name=nytobit/> It won the 1965 [[Edgar Award]] for Best Fact Crime and in 1980 was adapted as a movie for television and presented by [[Hallmark Hall of Fame]]. Lewis played a small role in the film.<ref>{{IMDb title|0080789|Gideon's Trumpet}}</ref>\n\nLewis published a second book in 1964, ''Portrait of a Decade: The Second American Revolution'', about the civil rights movement. In 1991, Mr. Lewis published ''Make No Law'', an account of ''[[The New York Times v. Sullivan]]'', the 1964 Supreme Court decision that revolutionized American libel law. In ''Sullivan'', the court held that public officials suing critics of their official conduct needed to prove that the contested statements were made with \"actual malice\", that is, with knowledge of their falsity or with serious subjective doubts about their truth.<ref name=nytobit/>\n\nThe ''Times'' moved Lewis to London in 1964, where he was bureau chief with responsibility for broad coverage of politics, culture and, in the words of one editor, \"ballet, music, Glyndebourne, la-di-da London society, diplomacy, the British character, you name it\".<ref name=nytobit/> He moved to New York in 1969 and began writing a twice-weekly opinion column for the ''Times''. He continued to write these pieces, which appeared under the heading \"At Home Abroad\" or \"Abroad at Home\" depending on his byline, until retiring in 2001. Though wide-ranging in his interests, he often focused on legal questions, advocacy of compromise between Israel and the Palestinians, and criticism of the war in Vietnam and the apartheid regime in South Africa. On December 15, 2001, his final column warned that civil liberties were at risk in the U.S. reaction to the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref name=nytobit/><ref name=lavoie/>\n\nReflecting on his years as a columnist, he said he had learned two lessons:<ref name=lavoie/>\n{{quote|One is that certainty is the enemy of decency and humanity in people who are sure they are right, like Osama bin Laden and (then-Attorney General) John Ashcroft. And secondly that for this country at least, given the kind of obstreperous, populous, diverse country we are, law is the absolute essential. And when governments short-cut the law, it's extremely dangerous.}}\n\nWhen told [[Henry Kissinger]] had once described him as \"always wrong\", Lewis replied: \"Probably because I wrote in a very uncomplimentary way about him.

He lectured at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] from 1974 to 1989 and was a visiting lecturer at several other colleges and universities, including the universities of [[University of Arizona|Arizona]], [[University of California|California]], [[University of Illinois|Illinois]], and [[University of Oregon|Oregon]].<ref name=lavoie/>\n\nIn 1983, Lewis received the [[Elijah P. Lovejoy|Elijah Parish Lovejoy]] Award as well as an honorary [[Doctor of Laws]] degree from [[Colby College]]. On January 8, 2001, he received the [[Presidential Citizens Medal]] from President [[Bill Clinton]]. On October 21, 2008, the [[National Coalition Against Censorship]] honored him for his work in the area of First Amendment rights and free expression.\n\nHe served for decades as a member of the ''Harvard Crimson'''s graduate board and as one of its trustees. He was a key player in the fundraising and reconstruction of the paper's Plympton Street building.<ref name=crimsonobit/>\n\nHe served on the board of directors of the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] (CPJ) and its policy committee. CPJ awarded him its Burton Benjamin Award for lifetime achievement in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|last=Massing|first=Michael|title=Tony Lewis gave CPJ authority, devotion over decades|url=http://www.cpj.org/blog/2013/03/tony-lewis-gave-cpj-authority-devotion-over-decade.php |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists|accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nHe was chosen Class Day speaker at Harvard in 1997.<ref name=crimsonobit/>\n\nHe was a member of the [[Whitney R. Harris World Law Institute]]'s International Council.\n\n==Views on the press==\nLewis read the First Amendment as a restriction on the ability of the federal government to regulate speech, but opposed attempts to broaden its meaning to create special protection for journalists. He approved when a federal court in 2005 jailed [[Judith Miller]], a ''The New York Times'' reporter, for refusing to name her confidential sources as a special prosecutor demanded she do. [[Max Frankel]], another ''Times'' editor said: \"In his later years he turned a little bit against the press, which he loved. But he disagreed with those of us who felt that we couldn't just trust the courts to defend our freedom\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Malone|first=Scott|title=NY Times legal trailblazer Anthony Lewis dead at 85|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/25/usa-people-anthonylewis-idUSL2N0CH1J820130325?|accessdate=March 28, 2013|newspaper=Reuters|date=March 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nLewis opposed as well journalists' advocacy of a federal \"shield law\" to allow journalists to refuse to reveal their sources. He cited the case of [[Wen Ho Lee]], whose privacy was, in Lewis' view, violated by newspapers who published leaked information and then refused to identify the sources of those leaks, preferring to agree to a financial settlement. He noted that the newspapers said they were acting to \"protect our journalists from further sanctions\", thus privileging their own needs over the damage caused the victim of the false information they printed.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Anthony|title=Are Journalists Privileged?|journal=Cardozo Law Review|date=March 2008|pages=1356\u20137|url=http://www.cardozolawreview.com/Joomla1.5/content/29-4/29.4_lewis_frankel_kovner.pdf|access-date=2013-03-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030156/http://www.cardozolawreview.com/Joomla1.5/content/29-4/29.4_lewis_frankel_kovner.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn July 8, 1951, Lewis married Linda J.

He was twice winner of the [[Pulitzer Prize]], and was a columnist for ''[[The New York Times]]''. He is credited with creating the field of legal journalism in the United States.\n\nEarly in Lewis' career as a legal journalist, Supreme Court Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]] told an editor of ''The New York Times'': \"I can't believe what this young man achieved.

He left in 1952 to work for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic National Committee]] on Adlai Stevenson's presidential campaign. He returned to journalism at the ''[[Washington Daily News]]'', an afternoon tabloid. He wrote a series of articles on the case of [[Abraham Chasanow]], a civilian employee of the U.S. Navy, who had been dismissed from his job on the basis of allegations by anonymous informers that he associated with anti-American subversives. The series won Lewis a [[Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting]] in 1955.<ref>{{cite web|title=1955 Winners|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1955|publisher=Pulitzer Prizes|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nLewis returned to ''The New York Times'' that year as its Washington bureau chief. He was assigned to cover the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. In 1956\u201357 he was a [[Nieman Fellowship|Nieman Fellow]] at [[Harvard Law School]].<ref name=nytobit/> He won a second Pulitzer Prize in 1963, again in the category National Reporting, for his coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court.<ref>{{cite web|title=1963 Winners|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1963|publisher=Pulitzer Prizes|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref> The citation singled out his coverage of the court's reasoning in ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'', a Supreme Court decision that held the federal courts could exercise authority over legislative redistricting on the part of the states, and the decision's impact on specific states.<ref name=nytobit/>\n\nIn his 1969 history of ''The New York Times'', [[Gay Talese]] described Lewis in his Washington years as \"cool, lean, well-scrubbed looking, intense and brilliant\".<ref name=nytobit/> Lewis became a member of Senator [[Robert Kennedy]]'s social circle, too conspicuously so in the opinion of [[Max Frankel]], another of the paper's editors.<ref name=nytobit/>\n\nDuring a four-month newspaper strike (November 1962 to February 1963), Lewis wrote ''[[Gideon's Trumpet]]'', the story of [[Clarence Earl Gideon]], the plaintiff in ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'', the 1963 case in which the Supreme Court held that states were required to provide counsel for indigent defendants charged with serious crimes. At Lewis' death it had not been out of print since it was first published.<ref name=nytobit/> It won the 1965 [[Edgar Award]] for Best Fact Crime and in 1980 was adapted as a movie for television and presented by [[Hallmark Hall of Fame]]. Lewis played a small role in the film.<ref>{{IMDb title|0080789|Gideon's Trumpet}}</ref>\n\nLewis published a second book in 1964, ''Portrait of a Decade: The Second American Revolution'', about the civil rights movement. In 1991, Mr. Lewis published ''Make No Law'', an account of ''[[The New York Times v. Sullivan]]'', the 1964 Supreme Court decision that revolutionized American libel law. In ''Sullivan'', the court held that public officials suing critics of their official conduct needed to prove that the contested statements were made with \"actual malice\", that is, with knowledge of their falsity or with serious subjective doubts about their truth.<ref name=nytobit/>\n\nThe ''Times'' moved Lewis to London in 1964, where he was bureau chief with responsibility for broad coverage of politics, culture and, in the words of one editor, \"ballet, music, Glyndebourne, la-di-da London society, diplomacy, the British character, you name it\".<ref name=nytobit/> He moved to New York in 1969 and began writing a twice-weekly opinion column for the ''Times''. He continued to write these pieces, which appeared under the heading \"At Home Abroad\" or \"Abroad at Home\" depending on his byline, until retiring in 2001. Though wide-ranging in his interests, he often focused on legal questions, advocacy of compromise between Israel and the Palestinians, and criticism of the war in Vietnam and the apartheid regime in South Africa. On December 15, 2001, his final column warned that civil liberties were at risk in the U.S. reaction to the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref name=nytobit/><ref name=lavoie/>\n\nReflecting on his years as a columnist, he said he had learned two lessons:<ref name=lavoie/>\n{{quote|One is that certainty is the enemy of decency and humanity in people who are sure they are right, like Osama bin Laden and (then-Attorney General) John Ashcroft. And secondly that for this country at least, given the kind of obstreperous, populous, diverse country we are, law is the absolute essential. And when governments short-cut the law, it's extremely dangerous.}}\n\nWhen told [[Henry Kissinger]] had once described him as \"always wrong\", Lewis replied: \"Probably because I wrote in a very uncomplimentary way about him. I didn\u2019t like him. He did things that were very damaging to human beings.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Solomon|first=Deborah|title=Speech Rules|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/magazine/23wwlnQ4-t.html|accessdate=March 27, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 23, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Other activities==\nBeginning in the mid-1970s, Lewis taught a course in First Amendment and the Supreme Court at [[Columbia University]]'s Graduate School of Journalism for 23 years.<ref name=crimsonobit/> He held the school's James Madison chair in First Amendment Issues from 1982. He lectured at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] from 1974 to 1989 and was a visiting lecturer at several other colleges and universities, including the universities of [[University of Arizona|Arizona]], [[University of California|California]], [[University of Illinois|Illinois]], and [[University of Oregon|Oregon]].<ref name=lavoie/>\n\nIn 1983, Lewis received the [[Elijah P. Lovejoy|Elijah Parish Lovejoy]] Award as well as an honorary [[Doctor of Laws]] degree from [[Colby College]]. On January 8, 2001, he received the [[Presidential Citizens Medal]] from President [[Bill Clinton]]. On October 21, 2008, the [[National Coalition Against Censorship]] honored him for his work in the area of First Amendment rights and free expression.\n\nHe served for decades as a member of the ''Harvard Crimson'''s graduate board and as one of its trustees. He was a key player in the fundraising and reconstruction of the paper's Plympton Street building.<ref name=crimsonobit/>\n\nHe served on the board of directors of the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] (CPJ) and its policy committee. CPJ awarded him its Burton Benjamin Award for lifetime achievement in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|last=Massing|first=Michael|title=Tony Lewis gave CPJ authority, devotion over decades|url=http://www.cpj.org/blog/2013/03/tony-lewis-gave-cpj-authority-devotion-over-decade.php |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists|accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nHe was chosen Class Day speaker at Harvard in 1997.<ref name=crimsonobit/>\n\n==Views on the press==\nLewis read the First Amendment as a restriction on the ability of the federal government to regulate speech, but opposed attempts to broaden its meaning to create special protection for journalists. He approved when a federal court in 2005 jailed [[Judith Miller]], a ''The New York Times'' reporter, for refusing to name her confidential sources as a special prosecutor demanded she do. [[Max Frankel]], another ''Times'' editor said: \"In his later years he turned a little bit against the press, which he loved. But he disagreed with those of us who felt that we couldn't just trust the courts to defend our freedom\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Malone|first=Scott|title=NY Times legal trailblazer Anthony Lewis dead at 85|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/25/usa-people-anthonylewis-idUSL2N0CH1J820130325?|accessdate=March 28, 2013|newspaper=Reuters|date=March 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nLewis opposed as well journalists' advocacy of a federal \"shield law\" to allow journalists to refuse to reveal their sources. He cited the case of [[Wen Ho Lee]], whose privacy was, in Lewis' view, violated by newspapers who published leaked information and then refused to identify the sources of those leaks, preferring to agree to a financial settlement. He noted that the newspapers said they were acting to \"protect our journalists from further sanctions\", thus privileging their own needs over the damage caused the victim of the false information they printed.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Anthony|title=Are Journalists Privileged?|journal=Cardozo Law Review|date=March 2008|pages=1356\u20137|url=http://www.cardozolawreview.com/Joomla1.5/content/29-4/29.4_lewis_frankel_kovner.pdf|access-date=2013-03-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030156/http://www.cardozolawreview.com/Joomla1.5/content/29-4/29.4_lewis_frankel_kovner.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn July 8, 1951, Lewis married Linda J.

Psychiatric case studies have shown that exaggerated exercise could lead to negligence of work and family life. With an addiction, individuals become \"hooked\" to the feeling of euphoria and pleasure that exercise provides. This pleasure keeps the individual from stopping and leads to excessive exercise.

Psychiatric case studies have shown that exaggerated exercise could lead to negligence of work and family life. With an addiction, individuals become \"hooked\" to the feeling of euphoria and pleasure that exercise provides. This pleasure keeps the individual from stopping and leads to excessive exercise. With a compulsion people often do not necessarily enjoy repeating certain tasks, as they may feel like performing it will fulfill a duty that is required of them.<ref name=Johnston/> There are many opinions on whether concrete diagnostic criteria should be created for this type of addiction.
