Kahn wanted to see what kind of mixture would best work as well as look the best.  Each mixture had a different color. In the basement of the complex, there are different colored concrete walls because Kahn was experimenting with the mixtures. Kahn also added teak wood to the complex. Kahn wanted the teak and the concrete to complement each other. The buildings themselves have been designed to promote collaboration, and thus there are no walls separating laboratories on any floor. There is one floor in the basement, and two above it on both sides. The lighting fixtures have been designed to easily slide along rails on the roof, in tune with the collaborative and open philosophy of the Salk Institute's science. Inside the laboratories, the ducts and vents are reinforced by concrete [[Vierendeel truss]]es supported by post-tensioned columns.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Key buildings of the twentieth century: plans, sections, and elevations|last=Weston|first=Richard|publisher=W.W. Norton|year=2004|isbn=978-0-393-73145-3|location=New York|page=138|via=}}</ref> The authorities at the time were very cautious due to the fact that they felt these trusses would not be able to hold in case of an earthquake, but in a ''tour de force'' of structural design, the engineer was able to achieve twice the ductility that a steel frame could offer.<ref name=\":0\" />  At first Kahn wanted to put a garden in the middle of the two buildings but, as construction continued, he did not know what shape it should take. When he saw an exhibit of [[Luis Barragan]]'s work at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, Kahn invited Baragan to collaborate on the court that separated the two buildings.  Barragan told Kahn that he should not add one leaf, nor plant, not one flower, nor dirt, instead, make it a plaza with a single water feature. The resulting space is considered the most impressive element of the entire design.\n\nAccording to A. Perez, the concrete was made with volcanic ash relying on the basis of ancient Roman concrete making techniques, and as a result gives off a warm, pinkish glow. This \"[[pozzolan]]ic\" concrete was then only vibrated as needed structurally, leaving a lightly textured wall face. The basement also houses the transgenic core. Each laboratory block has five study towers, with each tower containing four offices, except for those near the entrance to the court, which only contain two. A diagonal wall allows each of the thirty-six scientists using the studies to have a view of the Pacific, and every study is fitted with a combination of operable sliding and fixed glass panels in teak wood frames. Originally the design also included living quarters and a conference building, but they were never actually built.\n\n[[File:Salk Institute Side Perspective.jpg|thumb|left|Side perspective]]\n\nMost of the laboratories and studies are named after the benefactors, such as the Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neurobiology<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sloan-swartz.salk.edu/ |title=Sloan-Swartz |website=Sloan-swartz.salk.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-10-18}}</ref> and the Razavi Newman Center for Bioinformatics.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://bioinformatics.salk.edu/ | title=Salk Bioinformatics| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322131254/http://bioinformatics.salk.edu/| archive-date=2007-03-22}}</ref> A library that houses current periodicals, some books and computers is located on the 3rd level of the west end of the North building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.salk.edu/about/about_campus_directions.php?sid=about&subsid=campus |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223083439/http://www.salk.edu/about/about_campus_directions.php?sid=about&subsid=campus |archivedate=2007-12-23 |df= }}</ref> The Conrad T. Prebys auditorium and the Trustees' Room are located in the basement of the east buildings of the institute.\n\nIn the courtyard is a citrus grove containing several orderly rows of semi-dwarf [[Valencia orange]] trees.  This grove replaces the original grove which contained orange and kumquat trees which were then replaced with lime trees in the 1995 grove refurbishment.  This latest replacement was due primarily to a need to remove current trees for structural repairs and waterproofing of central plant ceilings. The trees were mulched and used for ground cover in compliance with project commitments to sustainability. The decision not to replant additional lime trees stems from dissatisfaction with the manner in which the current trees defoliate and turn yellow in the shade. The Valencia compensates for shade by producing additional chlorophyll in shaded sections, becoming greener.\n\n[[Image:Salk Institute2.jpg|thumb|right|Courtyard rill fountain]]\n\nThe Salk Institute's open environment replete with empty space is symbolic of an open environment for creation, the symmetry stands for scientific precision, and submerging crevasses allow warm, natural light to enter the buildings like the intellectual light that leads to discovery.  The contrast between balance and dynamic space manifests a pluralistic invitation for scientific study in structures developed to accommodate their respective functions as parts of a research facility. Although modern in appearance, it is essentially an isolated compound for individual and collaborative study, not unlike monasteries as sanctuaries for religious discovery, and they are thought to have directly influenced Kahn in his design. Ultimately, the Salk Institute's meaning can be interpreted as transcending function and physical place as a reflection of Western civilization's pursuit of truth through science.\n\nIn 2014, the [[Getty Conservation Institute]] partnered with the Salk Institute to preserve the concrete and teak building which is, due to its coastal location, subject to the punishing rigors of a marine environment.<ref name=\"latimes.com\"/>\n\n[[File:Salk Institute Panorama.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|center|360\u00b0 panorama in the courtyard of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California.]]\n\n==Training program==\nAlthough the Salk Institute is not a degree-granting institution, it runs a graduate program together with the neighboring [[UCSD]], and all Salk Institute professors receive adjunct appointments in the Division of Biological Sciences at UCSD.

Kahn wanted to see what kind of mixture would best work as well as look the best.  Each mixture had a different color. In the basement of the complex, there are different colored concrete walls because Kahn was experimenting with the mixtures. Kahn also added teak wood to the complex. Kahn wanted the teak and the concrete to complement each other. The buildings themselves have been designed to promote collaboration, and thus there are no walls separating laboratories on any floor. There is one floor in the basement, and two above it on both sides. The lighting fixtures have been designed to easily slide along rails on the roof, in tune with the collaborative and open philosophy of the Salk Institute's science. Inside the laboratories, the ducts and vents are reinforced by concrete [[Vierendeel truss]]es supported by post-tensioned columns.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Key buildings of the twentieth century: plans, sections, and elevations|last=Weston|first=Richard|publisher=W.W. Norton|year=2004|isbn=978-0-393-73145-3|location=New York|page=138|via=}}</ref> The authorities at the time were very cautious due to the fact that they felt these trusses would not be able to hold in case of an earthquake, but in a ''tour de force'' of structural design, the engineer was able to achieve twice the ductility that a steel frame could offer.<ref name=\":0\" />  At first Kahn wanted to put a garden in the middle of the two buildings but, as construction continued, he did not know what shape it should take. When he saw an exhibit of [[Luis Barragan]]'s work at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, Kahn invited Baragan to collaborate on the court that separated the two buildings.  Barragan told Kahn that he should not add one leaf, nor plant, not one flower, nor dirt, instead, make it a plaza with a single water feature. The resulting space is considered the most impressive element of the entire design.\n\nAccording to A. Perez, the concrete was made with volcanic ash relying on the basis of ancient Roman concrete making techniques, and as a result gives off a warm, pinkish glow. This \"[[pozzolan]]ic\" concrete was then only vibrated as needed structurally, leaving a lightly textured wall face. The basement also houses the transgenic core. Each laboratory block has five study towers, with each tower containing four offices, except for those near the entrance to the court, which only contain two. A diagonal wall allows each of the thirty-six scientists using the studies to have a view of the Pacific, and every study is fitted with a combination of operable sliding and fixed glass panels in teak wood frames. Originally the design also included living quarters and a conference building, but they were never actually built.\n\n[[File:Salk Institute Side Perspective.jpg|thumb|left|Side perspective]]\n\nMost of the laboratories and studies are named after the benefactors, such as the Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neurobiology<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sloan-swartz.salk.edu/ |title=Sloan-Swartz |website=Sloan-swartz.salk.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-10-18}}</ref> and the Razavi Newman Center for Bioinformatics.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://bioinformatics.salk.edu/ | title=Salk Bioinformatics| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322131254/http://bioinformatics.salk.edu/| archive-date=2007-03-22}}</ref> A library that houses current periodicals, some books and computers is located on the 3rd level of the west end of the North building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.salk.edu/about/about_campus_directions.php?sid=about&subsid=campus |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223083439/http://www.salk.edu/about/about_campus_directions.php?sid=about&subsid=campus |archivedate=2007-12-23 |df= }}</ref> The Conrad T. Prebys auditorium and the Trustees' Room are located in the basement of the east buildings of the institute.\n\nIn the courtyard is a citrus grove containing several orderly rows of semi-dwarf [[Valencia orange]] trees.  This grove replaces the original grove which contained orange and kumquat trees which were then replaced with lime trees in the 1995 grove refurbishment.  This latest replacement was due primarily to a need to remove current trees for structural repairs and waterproofing of central plant ceilings. The trees were mulched and used for ground cover in compliance with project commitments to sustainability. The decision not to replant additional lime trees stems from dissatisfaction with the manner in which the current trees defoliate and turn yellow in the shade. The Valencia compensates for shade by producing additional chlorophyll in shaded sections, becoming greener.\n\n[[Image:Salk Institute2.jpg|thumb|right|Courtyard rill fountain]]\n\nThe Salk Institute's open environment replete with empty space is symbolic of an open environment for creation, the symmetry stands for scientific precision, and submerging crevasses allow warm, natural light to enter the buildings like the intellectual light that leads to discovery.  The contrast between balance and dynamic space manifests a pluralistic invitation for scientific study in structures developed to accommodate their respective functions as parts of a research facility. Although modern in appearance, it is essentially an isolated compound for individual and collaborative study, not unlike monasteries as sanctuaries for religious discovery, and they are thought to have directly influenced Kahn in his design. Ultimately, the Salk Institute's meaning can be interpreted as transcending function and physical place as a reflection of Western civilization's pursuit of truth through science.\n\nIn 2014, the [[Getty Conservation Institute]] partnered with the Salk Institute to preserve the concrete and teak building which is, due to its coastal location, subject to the punishing rigors of a marine environment.<ref name=\"latimes.com\"/>\n\n[[File:Salk Institute Panorama.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|center|360\u00b0 panorama in the courtyard of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California.]]\n\n==Training program==\nAlthough the Salk Institute is not a degree-granting institution, it runs a graduate program together with the neighboring [[UCSD]], and all Salk Institute professors receive adjunct appointments in the Division of Biological Sciences at UCSD.
