Duke]], established [[The Duke Endowment]] with a $40 million trust fund. Income from the fund was to be distributed to hospitals, orphanages, the [[Methodist Church]], and four colleges (including Trinity College). [[William Preston Few]], the president of Trinity at the time, insisted that the institution be renamed Duke University to honor the family's generosity and to distinguish it from the myriad other colleges and universities carrying the \"Trinity\" name. At first, James B.

With the relocation of the college in 1892, the Board of Trustees voted to again allow women to be formally admitted to classes as day students. At the time of Washington Duke's donation in 1896, which carried the requirement that women be placed \"on an equal footing with men\" at the college, four women were enrolled; three of the four were faculty members' children. In 1903 Washington Duke wrote to the Board of Trustees withdrawing the provision, noting that it had been the only limitation he had ever put on a donation to the college. A woman's residential dormitory was built in 1897 and named the Mary Duke Building, after Washington Duke's daughter. By 1904, fifty-four women were enrolled in the college.

Income from the fund was to be distributed to hospitals, orphanages, the [[Methodist Church]], and four colleges (including Trinity College). [[William Preston Few]], the president of Trinity at the time, insisted that the institution be renamed Duke University to honor the family's generosity and to distinguish it from the myriad other colleges and universities carrying the \"Trinity\" name. At first, James B. Duke thought the name change would come off as self-serving, but eventually, he accepted Few's proposal as a memorial to his father.<ref name=\"king\" /> Money from the endowment allowed the University to grow quickly.

With the relocation of the college in 1892, the Board of Trustees voted to again allow women to be formally admitted to classes as day students. At the time of Washington Duke's donation in 1896, which carried the requirement that women be placed \"on an equal footing with men\" at the college, four women were enrolled; three of the four were faculty members' children. In 1903 Washington Duke wrote to the Board of Trustees withdrawing the provision, noting that it had been the only limitation he had ever put on a donation to the college. A woman's residential dormitory was built in 1897 and named the Mary Duke Building, after Washington Duke's daughter. By 1904, fifty-four women were enrolled in the college. In 1930, the Woman's College was established as a coordinate to the men's undergraduate college, which had been established and named Trinity College in 1924.<ref name=\"WashingtonDukeWomen\">{{cite web |last = King |first = William, E. |title = Washington Duke and the Education of Women|website = University Archives |publisher = David M.

The term ''thymesia'' is derived from the Greek word ''thymesis'', meaning \"memory\" and the Greek meaning of \"hyper\" means \"over\".<ref name=parker>Parker, E. S.; Cahill, L.; McGaugh, J. L. (2006). ''Psychology Press''. \"[http://zfhindbrain.com/files/75583289.pdf A Case of Unusual Autobiographical Remembering]\", 12, 35\u201349.</ref>\n\nThe capabilities of the affected individuals are not limited to recalling specific events from their personal experience. Hyperthymesia has both enhanced autobiographical and [[episodic memory]]<ref name=parker/> There is an important characteristic of hyperthymesia: People with the syndrome have an unusual form of eidetic memory to remember as well as recall any specific personal events or trivial details, including a date, the weather, what people wore on that day, from their past, almost in an organized manner.\n\nUnlike other people with advanced memory abilities, such as [[savant syndrome]] (who tend to use [[calendrical calculation]]), individuals with hyperthymestic syndrome rely heavily on their personal \"mental calendar\",<ref name=parker/> which is an automatic and obsessive process. Moreover, individuals with hyperthymesia do not focus on practiced [[mnemonic]] strategies.<ref name=parker/> For example, \"AJ\", who has the first documented case of hyperthymesia, has difficulty consciously applying her memory strategies to help her memorize new knowledge, making her rote memorization abilities below average.\n\n=== Neuroscience ===\nBecause it is a recently discovered memory capability, neuroscientific explanations of hyperthymesia are scarce. McGaugh, who coined the term, provides mostly speculation in \"A Case of Unusual Autobiographical Remembering\". He suggests that \"AJ\"'s superior autobiographical memory is largely the result of specific impairments rather than enhancements. Her sensitivity to cues that trigger her memories suggest that \"AJ\" has trouble inhibiting episodic-retrieval mode, which is the neurocognitive state required for present stimuli to be interpreted as memory cues. Because she is unable to \"turn off\" her retrieval mode, the smallest associations may bring on detailed recollections of \"AJ\"'s past.<ref name=parker/>\n\n[[Memory inhibition|Inhibition]] in itself is a type of executive functioning, thought to be associated with the right inferior [[frontal cortex]].<ref name=parker/> Although \"AJ\" is not autistic, McGaugh and colleagues note that she shares some of the executive-functioning deficits that occur with autism. These deficits, along with anomalous lateralization and \"AJ\"'s obsessive\u2013compulsive tendencies, point to a neurodevelopmental frontostriatal disorder common in autism, OCD, ADHD, Tourette's syndrome, and schizophrenia. The frontostriatal system is made up of the dorsolateral [[prefrontal cortex]], lateral [[orbitofrontal cortex]], [[cingulate]], supplementary motor area, and associated [[basal ganglia]] structures.<ref name=parker/>\n\n=== Cases ===\n{{As of|April 2016}}, there are an estimated 60 confirmed cases of hyperthymesia worldwide. Cases of hyperthymesia differ from related cases of savant memory in that savants have an extraordinary memory for specific hobbies, and events of a narrow basis, whereas cases of confirmed hyperthymesia show surprisingly detailed memory for specific and general events.\n\nOne subject, who, given any date in history, can recall what the weather was like on said date, personal details of their life at the time, and other news events that occurred at that time. Details of what the subject recalls may be significant to them in some way, but they may not be. Personal meaning does not seem to affect the subject's memory&nbsp;\u2013 they simply recall everything.<ref name=abc>(2006).

Man's rare ability may unlock secret of memory. CNN, Retrieved 19 March 2009, from http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/conditions/05/07/miraculous.memory/index.html</ref>\n\n=== Drawbacks ===\n\nAJ describes her memory as a \"running movie that never stops\".<ref name=parker/>  She views the world in \"split screen\", with the past constantly playing at the same time as the present.  She explains that although \"most have called it a gift\", she calls it a \"burden\".  AJ's superior memory does not seem to be due to a desire to apply memorizing techniques; her [[memorization]] of autobiographical information is [[unconscious mind|non-conscious]].  It is possible that AJ's memory could stem from the traumatic experience of having her family move when she was 8, at which point she began to \"organize her memories\" and think about the life she had left behind a great deal.\n\n== Eidetic memory ==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=December 2019}}\n[[Eidetic memory]]\u2014total recall memory\u2014refers to the ability of an individual who can accurately recall a large number of images, sounds and objects in a seemingly unlimited volume. Eidetic has a meaning of \"related extraordinarily detailed and vivid recall of visual images\" in Greek.<ref name=abc/> The term eidetic memory can become more clinical when the memory experts use the picture elicitation method to detect the ability.<ref name=martin/> In the picture elicitation method, children are asked to study an image for approximately twenty to thirty minutes, and then the researchers remove the picture, it has been found that children with such ability are able to recall the image with perfect accuracy after the picture has been removed. It has been suggested that children with eidetic memory can maintain the image in their memory as vividly as if it were still there.<ref name=abc/>\n\nThere are reports of different forms of eidetic memory as well as new case studies that suggest a difference between photographic and eidetic memory, although not enough scientific data exist currently from the medical community.{{example needed|date=December 2019}} Public documents from the APA, Yale, and Harvard suggest otherwise and that more studies are being done in order to properly stimulate the differences; all current noted forms of memory are open to the public but not meant to discriminate against the hypothesis of new types. Older studies have claimed to have observed a variety of drawbacks among those who have an apparent eidetic memory. Eidetic imagery can be so vivid as to mimic actual perception of stimuli, which can be much like a [[hallucination]].<ref name=gray>{{cite journal|last1 = Gray|first1 = C.

The experiment was intended to investigate chess grandmasters' ability to memorize positions of chess pieces on a chessboard.<ref name=groot>{{cite book|last1 = De Groot|first1 = A.|authorlink1 = Adriaan de Groot|last2 = Gobet|first2 = F.|authorlink2 = Fernand Gobet|last3 = Jongman|first3 = R.

Held since 1991, this is an annual competition in different memory disciplines and is nearly totally based on visual tasks&nbsp;\u2013 nine out of ten events are displayed visually, the tenth event is presented by audio. Since the champions can win interesting prizes, it should attract people who can beat those tests easily by reproducing visual images of the presented material during the recall. But indeed not a single memory champion has ever been reported to have an eidetic memory. Instead without a single exception all winners consider themselves mnemonists (see below) and rely on using [[mnemonic]] strategies, mostly the [[method of loci]].\n\n=== Cases ===\n[[File:JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John von Neumann]] possessed near-total recall]]\n[[List of people claimed to possess an eidetic memory|Cases of eidetic memory]] have been reported for generations,{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} with a 1970 study on a woman being called the most convincing documentation yet. Her memory was extraordinary in that she could see an image once and retain it in memory for years to come. The classic study of the subject's memory documents her writing out poetry in a foreign language, of which she had no prior knowledge, years after seeing the original text. This suggests that her memory retained the image of the foreign words vividly enough to recall years later. Reports also suggest that her memory was so vivid that she could obscure other parts of the present visual field with these past memories.<ref name=dewey>Dewey, R (2007). \"Eidetic memory and photographic memory\".

It is unclear what this illness was exactly but, symptoms included high fever, weight loss, delirium, and possibly even seizures. For this, Magnani was placed into a sanatorium. Here he had vivid dreams of his hometown, not of his family or friends or even of events, but of the town itself. According to Magnani, the dreams were in a detail beyond anything he could consciously imagine.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=An Anthropologist On Mars|last=Sacks|first=Oliver|publisher=Public Random House, LLC|year=1995|isbn=978-0-679-75697-2|location=New York|pages=153\u2013187}}</ref>\n\nAfter getting released from the hospital, Franco Magnani considered, but ultimately rejected medical possibilities that were suggested. These possibilities included some sort of freudian splitting of the ego which could have resulted in hypermnesia hysteria. While Magnani rejected these notions, he never allowed them to be properly explored.<ref name=\":2\" /> Once relocating to San Francisco, Magnani picked up painting, which he had no formal training in. His first painting was of his childhood home in Pontito. Magnani painted the house in remarkable accuracy, so much so that he himself was amazed. This was especially surprising considering the fact that at this point, Magnani had not been to Pontito in over 25 years. Over time, he grew an obsession to painting the town in which he grew up in, famed psychologist Oliver Sacks noted in 1987, Magnini seemed \"possessed.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThat same year, photographer Susan Schwartzenberg went to Pontito to photograph the scenes of many of Magnani's paintings.<ref name=\":1\" /> This was done as part of a study to document the astonishing accuracy of the artists work. This study would be revealed in an art exhibit on memory in 1988. This garnered lots of attention by researchers such as Bob Miller who suggested that this work could reveal the accuracy, distortions, and inventions of Magnani's memory. These photographs showed something interesting about Magnani's work that was not previously evident. The Exploratorium, which hosted the exhibit for which Schwartzenberg took photos for, explains this observation while examining a drawing of a church. \"This drawing, looking down from a point high above the path approaching the church, shows a view that Magnani could never have seen.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Work done by Baddley and Hitch in 1974<ref>{{Citation|title=Baddeley's model of working memory|date=2019-12-14|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Baddeley%27s_model_of_working_memory&oldid=930708873|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-12-16}}</ref> showed the importance of the visuospatial sketchpad in their model of working memory.

His visual sensory information was stored long term which he was able to recall more than a quarter of a century later in intricate detail. This prompted praise from Sacks, stating that this rare phenomenon made him an eidetic artist.<ref name=\":2\" /> Sacks went on to say, \"he could seemingly reproduce with almost photographic accuracy every building, every street, every stone of Pontito, far away, close up, from any possible angle.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Mnemonists==\nA [[mnemonic device]] is a memory aid that is used to help an individual remember and recall information. Mnemonic devices are usually verbal, such as a special phrase, word or a short poem that individuals are familiar with.\n\nEach individual has two types of memory, termed \"natural memory\" and \"artificial memory\".<ref name=parker/> Mnemonic strategy is said to help develop artificial memory through learning and practicing [[Art of memory|memory techniques]].<ref name=parker/>\n\nCommon mnemonics for memorizing lists of words is through the use of acronym, which is the abbreviation that consists of the initial letter in a phrase or word. For example, HOMES is often used to help remember the names of the [[Great Lakes]] of North America. Most techniques for memorizing numbers involve turning the numbers into visual images that are then placed along points of an imaginary [[Method of loci|memory journey]]. The mind has difficulty remembering abstract concepts like numbers, but can easily remember visual images. The imaginary memory journey orders the images in the correct sequence. Two common techniques for converting numbers and playing cards into visual images are the [[Mnemonic major system]] and the [[Mnemonic dominic system]].\n\n=== Neuroscience ===\nNo structural differences have been found in the brains of accomplished memorists, who have achieved superior memory with the practiced use of mnemonic devices. One study that sought to locate the neural differences between these and people with typical memory abilities using [[fMRI]], was unable to find any differences. For memorists, the right [[cingulate cortex]], [[ventral fusiform cortex]], and left posterior [[inferior frontal sulcus]] were more active for [[Piphilology|digit span memorization]] (a feat memorists are often very good at).<ref name=maguire>Maguire, E.

[[Alexander Luria]] reported that \"S\" had the unique ability to recall almost everything he heard or saw though did not provide detailed evidence or clearly distinguish between \"natural\" abilities and his use of the [[method of loci]]. There are several anecdotal reports of \"S\" recalling a speech word for word without taking notes along with his peers.\n\nAnother interesting case of recall is of the subject S.F., who began testing with an average intelligence and average memory capabilities. With the use of mnemonic strategies (practice sessions in the laboratory) he was able to increase his digit span from 7 to 79.<ref name=ericson>Ericsson, A, Chase, W, & Faloon, S Acquisition of a memory skill.

Cases such as these suggest that superior memory can be achieved with the proper mnemonic techniques.\n\nAlso all competitors of the annual [[World Memory Championships]] name mnemonic strategies the source for their performances (including performances like memorizing a list of more than 2000 digits in an hour, 280 words in 15 minutes or the order of a deck of cards in under 25 seconds).\n\n=== Drawbacks ===\n[[Solomon Shereshevskii]], or 'S', was viewed by peers as disorganized and unintelligent.

Wawro is known for his paintings of landscapes and seascapes, all done in elaborate detail.<ref name=treffert/> What is interesting about Wawro's art is that he paints from seeing a scene only once and does not use a model. His memory for the scene is so elaborate that he can also report where he drew the picture and when. Similarities across cases indicate that savant memory may be similar to eidetic memory.<ref name=treffert/>\n\n=== Drawbacks ===\nIndividuals with [[autism]] are more likely to have savant skills so, for them, the most obvious drawback could be the drawbacks they link to autism itself.  Most cases of [[calendrical calculation]] involve individuals with IQs that are below average.  Autism spectrum disorders contain criteria for diagnosis based on difficulties with social behaviour and communicating with others, amongst other debilitating criteria.<ref name=gaigg/> Researchers have proposed two hypotheses to explain how autistic individuals may develop advanced skills;<ref name=oconnor>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0160-2896(99)00028-8 | last = O'Connor | first = N |author2=Cowan R |author3=Samella K | year = 2000 | title = Calendrical Calculation and Intelligence | journal = Intelligence | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 31\u201348 }}</ref> the first is the obsession with constricted areas of interest (a common symptom of autism) and [[central coherence]].  Central coherence is a style of [[cognitive processing]] indicative of an autistic individual, which involves a focus on local features during processing.  Researchers feel that this style of processing may aid in the increase of savant skills, but this style also sacrifices global processing in the process.\n\n== Emotional memory ==\n{{Main|Flashbulb memory}}\nAn '''emotional''' or '''flashbulb''' memory refers to the memory of a personal significant event with distinctly vivid and long-lasting detailed information. These events are usually shocking and with photographic quality. Brown and Kulik, who coined the term, found that many highly emotional memories can be recalled with very accurate details, even when there is a delay after the event.<ref name=brown>{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = R. | last2 = Kulik | first2 = J. | year = 1977 | title = Flashbulb memories | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 73\u201399 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(77)90018-X }}</ref>\n\nA Flashbulb memory is said to be less accurate and less permanent than [[photographic memory|photographic memories]], but its [[forgetting curve]] is less affected by time in comparing to other types of memories.<ref name=markham>Markham, A. N. (Ed.). (8 November 2001). Flashbulb Memory. In Welcome to UIC. Retrieved 2 April 2009, from http://www.uic.edu/classes/comm/comm200am/teamprojects/MemoryTechnologies/Flashbulb_Memory.htm</ref> One important aspect of flashbulb memory is that it involves emotional arousal when the event is being remembered. Therefore, this kind of memory does not have to be accurate, and the accuracy usually decreases during the first 3 months and goes up again at about 12 months.<ref name=markham/>\n\nA study conducted by Sharot et al. (2006) showed that the rating of vividness of terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, by the participants is related to the physical location of the person when the event happened.<ref name=kensinger>Kensinger, E. A. (2009). [http://emr.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/1/2/99 \"Remembering the Details: Effects of Emotion\"]. ''The International Society for Research on Emotion''. 99\u2013113. Retrieved April 2, 2009</ref>\n\n=== Neuroscience ===\nThe focus of the research on [[emotional memory]] is on the role of the [[amygdala]].  In one study participants watched either an emotionally arousing film or a neutral film. Results of a [[PET scan]] showed correlation between right [[Archistriatum|Amygdaloid Complex]] (AC) activity and recall for emotional elements of the film when participants were asked to remember the film a few weeks later.<ref name=cahill/> Although this study demonstrates the involvement of the AC, it offers no insight as to the specific role of the amygdala. [[James McGaugh|McGaugh]] and colleagues posit that although electrical and pharmaceutical stimulation directly to the amygdala can enhance or decrease memory, the amygdala is not the main site for any [[long-term memory]] storage. Rather, the amygdala acts as a modulator for storage processes occurring in other areas of the brain. Long-term memories are not created automatically, they must be consolidated over time. Research indicates that it is this consolidation process in which the AC plays an assisting role (there is no evidence that it aids in retrieval). Specifically, McGaugh suggests that emotional arousal activates the amygdala, which regulates the strength of a memory, lending to enhanced memory for emotionally charged events.<ref name=roozendaal>McGaugh, J. L., Cahill, L., & Roozendaal, B. (1996). Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. Involvement of the amygdala in memory storage: interaction with other brain systems, 93(24), 13508-13514.</ref>\n\nThe amygdala itself is a collection of [[nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nuclei]] with distinct functions, the basolateral AC the most involved with memory.<ref name=cahill/> The BL projects into the hippocampus and [[entorhinal cortex]] and stimulation of the AC functioning activates both of these areas.<ref name=cahill/> Further indication that the amygdala works to modulate other areas of the brain is supported by the fact that AC stimulation is mediated by the [[stria terminalis]] (ST), a major AC pathway. Lesions of the ST block AC stimulation effects.<ref name=cahill/>\n\nAC and ST lesions also appear to block [[hormonal]] and [[adrenaline]] enhancements. [[Stress hormones]] produced by emotional situations influence memory storage. Memory can also be selectively enhanced by post-training administration of drugs and hormones. It is also well known that emotional situations produce an \"[[Fight-or-flight response|adrenaline rush]]\". This adrenaline, as well as [[cortisol]] (adrenocortical hormone) serve to influence an organism's response to stress, but also may aid future responding by enhancing declarative memory of them.<ref name=cahill/>\n\nNegative emotional experiences may be remembered better than positive experiences. [[Ben Goddard|Goddard]] found that retention was disrupted with electrical stimulation of AC after aversive learning, but not with appetitively motivated learning.\n\n=== Drawbacks ===\n\nAn experience must be very arousing to an individual for it to be consolidated as an [[emotional memory]], and this arousal can be negative, thus causing a negative memory to be strongly retained.<ref name=cahill>Cahill, L. & McGaugh, J.L.

The term ''thymesia'' is derived from the Greek word ''thymesis'', meaning \"memory\" and the Greek meaning of \"hyper\" means \"over\". <ref name=parker>Parker, E. S.; Cahill, L.; McGaugh, J. L. (2006). ''Psychology Press''. \"[http://zfhindbrain.com/files/75583289.pdf A Case of Unusual Autobiographical Remembering]\", 12, 35\u201349.</ref>\n\nThe capabilities of the affected individuals are not limited to recalling specific events from their personal experience. Hyperthymesia has both enhanced autobiographical and [[episodic memory]]<ref name=parker/> There is an important characteristic of hyperthymesia: People with the syndrome have an unusual form of eidetic memory to remember as well as recall any specific personal events or trivial details, including a date, the weather, what people wore on that day, from their past, almost in an organized manner.\n\nUnlike other people with advanced memory abilities, such as [[savant syndrome]] (who tend to use [[calendrical calculation]]), individuals with hyperthymestic syndrome rely heavily on their personal \"mental calendar\",<ref name=parker/> which is an automatic and obsessive process. Moreover, individuals with hyperthymesia do not focus on practiced [[mnemonic]] strategies.<ref name=parker/> For example, \"AJ\", who has the first documented case of hyperthymesia, has difficulty consciously applying her memory strategies to help her memorize new knowledge, making her rote memorization abilities below average.\n\n=== Neuroscience ===\nBecause it is a recently discovered memory capability, neuroscientific explanations of hyperthymesia are scarce. McGaugh, who coined the term, provides mostly speculation in \"A Case of Unusual Autobiographical Remembering\". He suggests that \"AJ\"'s superior autobiographical memory is largely the result of specific impairments rather than enhancements. Her sensitivity to cues that trigger her memories suggest that \"AJ\" has trouble inhibiting episodic-retrieval mode, which is the neurocognitive state required for present stimuli to be interpreted as memory cues. Because she is unable to \"turn off\" her retrieval mode, the smallest associations may bring on detailed recollections of \"AJ\"'s past.<ref name=parker/>\n\n[[Memory inhibition|Inhibition]] in itself is a type of executive functioning, thought to be associated with the right inferior [[frontal cortex]].<ref name=parker/> Although \"AJ\" is not autistic, McGaugh and colleagues note that she shares some of the executive-functioning deficits that occur with autism. These deficits, along with anomalous lateralization and \"AJ\"'s obsessive\u2013compulsive tendencies, point to a neurodevelopmental frontostriatal disorder common in autism, OCD, ADHD, Tourette's syndrome, and schizophrenia. The frontostriatal system is made up of the dorsolateral [[prefrontal cortex]], lateral [[orbitofrontal cortex]], [[cingulate]], supplementary motor area, and associated [[basal ganglia]] structures.<ref name=parker/>\n\n=== Cases ===\n{{As of|April 2016}}, there are an estimated 60 confirmed cases of hyperthymesia worldwide. Cases of hyperthymesia differ from related cases of savant memory in that savants have an extraordinary memory for specific hobbies, and events of a narrow basis, whereas cases of confirmed hyperthymesia show surprisingly detailed memory for specific and general events.\n\nOne subject, who, given any date in history, can recall what the weather was like on said date, personal details of their life at the time, and other news events that occurred at that time. Details of what the subject recalls may be significant to them in some way, but they may not be. Personal meaning does not seem to affect the subject's memory&nbsp;\u2013 they simply recall everything.<ref name=abc>(2006).

CNN, Retrieved 19 March 2009, from http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/conditions/05/07/miraculous.memory/index.html</ref>\n\n=== Drawbacks ===\n\nAJ describes her memory as a \"running movie that never stops\".<ref name=parker/>  She views the world in \"split screen\", with the past constantly playing at the same time as the present.  She explains that although \"most have called it a gift\", she calls it a \"burden\".  AJ's superior memory does not seem to be due to a desire to apply memorizing techniques; her [[memorization]] of autobiographical information is [[unconscious mind|non-conscious]].  It is possible that AJ's memory could stem from the traumatic experience of having her family move when she was 8, at which point she began to \"organize her memories\" and think about the life she had left behind a great deal.\n\n== Eidetic memory ==\n{{Refimprove|section|date=December 2019}}\n[[Eidetic memory]]\u2014total recall memory\u2014refers to the ability of an individual who can accurately recall a large number of images, sounds and objects in a seemingly unlimited volume. Eidetic has a meaning of \"related extraordinarily detailed and vivid recall of visual images\" in Greek.<ref name=abc/> The term eidetic memory can become more clinical when the memory experts use the picture elicitation method to detect the ability.<ref name=martin/> In the picture elicitation method, children are asked to study an image for approximately twenty to thirty minutes, and then the researchers remove the picture, it has been found that children with such ability are able to recall the image with perfect accuracy after the picture has been removed. It has been suggested that children with eidetic memory can maintain the image in their memory as vividly as if it were still there.<ref name=abc/>\n\nThere are reports of different forms of eidetic memory as well as new case studies that suggest a difference between photographic and eidetic memory, although not enough scientific data exist currently from the medical community.{{example needed|date=December 2019}} Public documents from the APA, Yale, and Harvard suggest otherwise and that more studies are being done in order to properly stimulate the differences; all current noted forms of memory are open to the public but not meant to discriminate against the hypothesis of new types. Older studies have claimed to have observed a variety of drawbacks among those who have an apparent eidetic memory.

Held since 1991, this is an annual competition in different memory disciplines and is nearly totally based on visual tasks&nbsp;\u2013 nine out of ten events are displayed visually, the tenth event is presented by audio. Since the champions can win interesting prizes, it should attract people who can beat those tests easily by reproducing visual images of the presented material during the recall. But indeed not a single memory champion has ever been reported to have an eidetic memory. Instead without a single exception all winners consider themselves mnemonists (see below) and rely on using [[mnemonic]] strategies, mostly the [[method of loci]].\n\n=== Cases ===\n[[File:JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John von Neumann]] possessed near-total recall]]\n[[List of people claimed to possess an eidetic memory|Cases of eidetic memory]] have been reported for generations,{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} with a 1970 study on a woman being called the most convincing documentation yet. Her memory was extraordinary in that she could see an image once and retain it in memory for years to come. The classic study of the subject's memory documents her writing out poetry in a foreign language, of which she had no prior knowledge, years after seeing the original text. This suggests that her memory retained the image of the foreign words vividly enough to recall years later. Reports also suggest that her memory was so vivid that she could obscure other parts of the present visual field with these past memories.<ref name=dewey>Dewey, R (2007). \"Eidetic memory and photographic memory\".

According to Magnani, the dreams were in a detail beyond anything he could consciously imagine.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=An Anthropologist On Mars|last=Sacks|first=Oliver|publisher=Public Random House, LLC|year=1995|isbn=978-0-679-75697-2|location=New York|pages=153\u2013187}}</ref>  \n\nAfter getting released from the hospital, Franco Magnani considered, but ultimately rejected medical possibilities that were suggested. These possibilities included some sort of freudian splitting of the ego which could have resulted in hypermnesia hysteria. While Magnani rejected these notions, he never allowed them to be properly explored.<ref name=\":2\" /> Once relocating to San Francisco, Magnani picked up painting, which he had no formal training in. His first painting was of his childhood home in Pontito. Magnani painted the house in remarkable accuracy, so much so that he himself was amazed. This was especially surprising considering the fact that at this point, Magnani had not been to Pontito in over 25 years. Over time, he grew an obsession to painting the town in which he grew up in, famed psychologist Oliver Sacks noted in 1987, Magnini seemed \"possessed.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\nThat same year, photographer Susan Schwartzenberg went to Pontito to photograph the scenes of many of Magnani's paintings.<ref name=\":1\" /> This was done as part of a study to document the astonishing accuracy of the artists work. This study would be revealed in an art exhibit on memory in 1988. This garnered lots of attention by researchers such as Bob Miller who suggested that this work could reveal the accuracy, distortions, and inventions of Magnani's memory. These photographs showed something interesting about Magnani's work that was not previously evident.

Mnemonic devices are usually verbal, such as a special phrase, word or a short poem that individuals are familiar with.\n\nEach individual has two types of memory, termed \"natural memory\" and \"artificial memory\".<ref name=parker/> Mnemonic strategy is said to help develop artificial memory through learning and practicing [[Art of memory|memory techniques]].<ref name=parker/>\n\nCommon mnemonics for memorizing lists of words is through the use of acronym, which is the abbreviation that consists of the initial letter in a phrase or word. For example, HOMES is often used to help remember the names of the [[Great Lakes]] of North America. Most techniques for memorizing numbers involve turning the numbers into visual images that are then placed along points of an imaginary [[Method of loci|memory journey]]. The mind has difficulty remembering abstract concepts like numbers, but can easily remember visual images. The imaginary memory journey orders the images in the correct sequence. Two common techniques for converting numbers and playing cards into visual images are the [[Mnemonic major system]] and the [[Mnemonic dominic system]].\n\n=== Neuroscience ===\nNo structural differences have been found in the brains of accomplished memorists, who have achieved superior memory with the practiced use of mnemonic devices. One study that sought to locate the neural differences between these and people with typical memory abilities using [[fMRI]], was unable to find any differences. For memorists, the right [[cingulate cortex]], [[ventral fusiform cortex]], and left posterior [[inferior frontal sulcus]] were more active for [[Piphilology|digit span memorization]] (a feat memorists are often very good at).<ref name=maguire>Maguire, E.

[[Alexander Luria]] reported that \"S\" had the unique ability to recall almost everything he heard or saw though did not provide detailed evidence or clearly distinguish between \"natural\" abilities and his use of the [[method of loci]]. There are several anecdotal reports of \"S\" recalling a speech word for word without taking notes along with his peers.\n\nAnother interesting case of recall is of the subject S.F., who began testing with an average intelligence and average memory capabilities. With the use of mnemonic strategies (practice sessions in the laboratory) he was able to increase his digit span from 7 to 79.<ref name=ericson>Ericsson, A, Chase, W, & Faloon, S Acquisition of a memory skill.

Cases such as these suggest that superior memory can be achieved with the proper mnemonic techniques.\n\nAlso all competitors of the annual [[World Memory Championships]] name mnemonic strategies the source for their performances (including performances like memorizing a list of more than 2000 digits in an hour, 280 words in 15 minutes or the order of a deck of cards in under 25 seconds).\n\n=== Drawbacks ===\n[[Solomon Shereshevskii]], or 'S', was viewed by peers as disorganized and unintelligent.  His extreme case of synesthesia, causing highly detailed and recallable memory traces, made understanding abstract concepts not based on sensory and perceptual qualities very difficult for him.<ref name=luria>Luria, A.R. (1987). [https://archive.org/details/mindofmnemonistl0000luri The mind of a mnemonist]. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref>  His personal life is described as being lived in a \"haze,\" and eventually he was confined to a [[mental institution]] because of the burden of his exceptional abilities. But S is a rare exception and drawbacks are not normally associated with the acquisition of an exceptional memory by using mnemonics.<ref>Foer, Joshua (2011).

They are also associated with typical and atypical functioning in memory.<ref name=gaigg>{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.11.011|pmid = 18164320|year = 2008|last1 = Gaigg|first1 = S.|last2 = Gardiner|first2 = J.|last3 = Bowler|first3 = D.|title = Free recall in autism spectrum disorder: the role of relational and item-specific encoding|volume = 46|issue = 4|pages = 983\u2013992|pmc = 2265793|journal = Neuropsychologia}}</ref>  Structural abnormalities have been found to affect the [[hippocampus]], with the [[perirhinal]], [[entorhinal]], and [[parahippocampus]] less affected (these are areas in the [[medial temporal lobe]] outside of the hippocampus). The hippocampus is thought to be involved in domain-general relational processes, with surrounding areas mediating more domain and item-specific and contextual processing. This is consistent with observed memory effects of ASD which shows superior low-level and item-specific processing, at a cost of having impairments in higher level relational processes.<ref name=gaigg/>\n\nOne example found in the literature is J.S., with high functioning autism. J.S. has no [[episodic memory]] (which is highly associative or relational in nature) and must rely on memorizing facts. He will memorize entire conversations, so as to remember even general content later. He also remembers events by memorizing A-B-C predicates\u2014item-specific memory with a memorized (specific) association connecting them.<ref name=boucher>{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1177/1362361307076863|pmid = 17478578|year = 2007|last1 = Boucher | first1 = J.|title = Memory and generativity in very high functioning autism: a firsthand account, and an interpretation|volume = 11|issue = 3|pages = 255\u2013264|journal = Autism}}</ref>\n\n=== Cases ===\n[[File:Kim Peek, diagnosed with Savant syndrome.jpg|thumb|[[Kim Peek]], diagnosed with Savant syndrome]]\n[[Savant syndrome]] is elaborate abilities (including memory) in specialized areas such as a hobby or event, or a certain type of information.

Wawro is known for his paintings of landscapes and seascapes, all done in elaborate detail.<ref name=treffert/> What is interesting about Wawro's art is that he paints from seeing a scene only once and does not use a model. His memory for the scene is so elaborate that he can also report where he drew the picture and when. Similarities across cases indicate that savant memory may be similar to eidetic memory.<ref name=treffert/>\n\n=== Drawbacks ===\nIndividuals with [[autism]] are more likely to have savant skills so, for them, the most obvious drawback could be the drawbacks they link to autism itself.  Most cases of [[calendrical calculation]] involve individuals with IQs that are below average.  Autism spectrum disorders contain criteria for diagnosis based on difficulties with social behaviour and communicating with others, amongst other debilitating criteria.<ref name=gaigg/> Researchers have proposed two hypotheses to explain how autistic individuals may develop advanced skills;<ref name=oconnor>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0160-2896(99)00028-8 | last = O'Connor | first = N |author2=Cowan R |author3=Samella K | year = 2000 | title = Calendrical Calculation and Intelligence | journal = Intelligence | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 31\u201348 }}</ref> the first is the obsession with constricted areas of interest (a common symptom of autism) and [[central coherence]].  Central coherence is a style of [[cognitive processing]] indicative of an autistic individual, which involves a focus on local features during processing.  Researchers feel that this style of processing may aid in the increase of savant skills, but this style also sacrifices global processing in the process.\n\n== Emotional memory ==\n{{Main|Flashbulb memory}}\nAn '''emotional''' or '''flashbulb''' memory refers to the memory of a personal significant event with distinctly vivid and long-lasting detailed information. These events are usually shocking and with photographic quality. Brown and Kulik, who coined the term, found that many highly emotional memories can be recalled with very accurate details, even when there is a delay after the event.<ref name=brown>Brown, R., & Kulik, J. (1977). \"Flashbulb memories\". ''Cognition'' 5: 73\u201399. {{doi|10.1016/0010-0277(77)90018-X}}.</ref>\n\nA Flashbulb memory is said to be less accurate and less permanent than [[photographic memory|photographic memories]], but its [[forgetting curve]] is less affected by time in comparing to other types of memories.<ref name=markham>Markham, A. N. (Ed.). (8 November 2001). Flashbulb Memory. In Welcome to UIC. Retrieved 2 April 2009, from http://www.uic.edu/classes/comm/comm200am/teamprojects/MemoryTechnologies/Flashbulb_Memory.htm</ref> One important aspect of flashbulb memory is that it involves emotional arousal when the event is being remembered. Therefore, this kind of memory does not have to be accurate, and the accuracy usually decreases during the first 3 months and goes up again at about 12 months.<ref name=markham/>\n\nA study conducted by Sharot et al. (2006) showed that the rating of vividness of terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, by the participants is related to the physical location of the person when the event happened.<ref name=kensinger>Kensinger, E. A. (2009). [http://emr.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/1/2/99 \"Remembering the Details: Effects of Emotion\"]. ''The International Society for Research on Emotion''. 99\u2013113. Retrieved April 2, 2009</ref>\n\n=== Neuroscience ===\nThe focus of the research on [[emotional memory]] is on the role of the [[amygdala]].  In one study participants watched either an emotionally arousing film or a neutral film. Results of a [[PET scan]] showed correlation between right [[Archistriatum|Amygdaloid Complex]] (AC) activity and recall for emotional elements of the film when participants were asked to remember the film a few weeks later.<ref name=cahill/> Although this study demonstrates the involvement of the AC, it offers no insight as to the specific role of the amygdala. [[James McGaugh|McGaugh]] and colleagues posit that although electrical and pharmaceutical stimulation directly to the amygdala can enhance or decrease memory, the amygdala is not the main site for any [[long-term memory]] storage. Rather, the amygdala acts as a modulator for storage processes occurring in other areas of the brain. Long-term memories are not created automatically, they must be consolidated over time. Research indicates that it is this consolidation process in which the AC plays an assisting role (there is no evidence that it aids in retrieval). Specifically, McGaugh suggests that emotional arousal activates the amygdala, which regulates the strength of a memory, lending to enhanced memory for emotionally charged events.<ref name=roozendaal>McGaugh, J. L., Cahill, L., & Roozendaal, B. (1996). Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. Involvement of the amygdala in memory storage: interaction with other brain systems, 93(24), 13508-13514.</ref>\n\nThe amygdala itself is a collection of [[nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nuclei]] with distinct functions, the basolateral AC the most involved with memory.<ref name=cahill/> The BL projects into the hippocampus and [[entorhinal cortex]] and stimulation of the AC functioning activates both of these areas.<ref name=cahill/> Further indication that the amygdala works to modulate other areas of the brain is supported by the fact that AC stimulation is mediated by the [[stria terminalis]] (ST), a major AC pathway. Lesions of the ST block AC stimulation effects.<ref name=cahill/>\n\nAC and ST lesions also appear to block [[hormonal]] and [[adrenaline]] enhancements. [[Stress hormones]] produced by emotional situations influence memory storage. Memory can also be selectively enhanced by post-training administration of drugs and hormones. It is also well known that emotional situations produce an \"[[Fight-or-flight response|adrenaline rush]]\". This adrenaline, as well as [[cortisol]] (adrenocortical hormone) serve to influence an organism's response to stress, but also may aid future responding by enhancing declarative memory of them.<ref name=cahill/>\n\nNegative emotional experiences may be remembered better than positive experiences. [[Ben Goddard|Goddard]] found that retention was disrupted with electrical stimulation of AC after aversive learning, but not with appetitively motivated learning.\n\n=== Drawbacks ===\n\nAn experience must be very arousing to an individual for it to be consolidated as an [[emotional memory]], and this arousal can be negative, thus causing a negative memory to be strongly retained.<ref name=cahill>Cahill, L. & McGaugh, J.L.
