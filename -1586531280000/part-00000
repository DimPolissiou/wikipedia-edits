On 27 May 1967, ''[[The Times]]'' published a letter from J. W. Paulley, a physician, who wrote: {{quote|\"Is it now time to examine the possibility of creating at least one university in this country on the pattern of [the] great private foundations in the USA\".<ref name=\"text\">The Times, 27 May 1967, p. 20.</ref>}} Three London conferences followed which explored this idea.<ref name=\"test\">Buckingham at 25, ed.

Peacock|Sir Alan Peacock]], the economist, founder of the Economics department at the [[University of York]], and Fellow of the [[British Academy]]; and [[Richard Luce, Baron Luce|Sir Richard Luce]], now Lord Luce, the former Minister for the Arts.\n\nFrom 2004, students at Buckingham have been eligible for student loans, which led to an increase in UK students at the university.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.qaa.ac.uk/docs/qaa/reports/university-of-buckingham-ireni-12.pdf?sfvrsn=d351f581_4 | title=Institutional Review \u2013 University of Buckingham | publisher=Quality Assurance Agency|accessdate=15 June 2019| page=4}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:The 'Flosh' and Lords Bridge, Buckingham - geograph.org.uk - 1316741.jpg|thumb|A weir and mill that fall within Buckingham University's Hunter Street campus.]]\n[[File:Town Mill, Buckingham - geograph.org.uk - 1316769.jpg|thumb|Tanlaw Mill, formerly the old Town Mill (OTM)]]\nNear the centre of the town of Buckingham is the riverside campus, which is partly contained within a south-turning bend of the River Great Ouse. Here, on or just off Hunter Street, are some of the university's central buildings: [[Yeomanry House, Buckingham|Yeomanry House]] (which contains the reception and central administration); the Anthony de Rothchild building (which contains Business and Economics); the Humanities Library; and also some of the student accommodation, looking northwards across the river. Prebend House, a recently restored Georgian house, contains parts of the department of Politics and also Economics. On the other side of Hunter Street, on the so-called 'island', is the Tanlaw Mill, one of the university's social centres \u2013 with the main refectory, the Fitness Centre, and the Students' Union Office.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buckingham.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Hunter-Street-Campus-Map2017.pdf|title=Hunter Street Campus|publisher=University of Buckingham|accessdate=2 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nOverlooking this site, on the hill above, is the extensive Chandos Building. This complex contains the main teaching areas for English Literature, English Language, Journalism, Modern Foreign Languages, and the Foundation programmes, and also some of the teaching rooms and one of the lecture theatres for Medicine. It also houses the Ian-Fairburn Lecture Theatre, the largest lecture theatre on the river-side site. Adjacent to the Chandos Building, is the Department of Education. This has both a research arm, and also a teacher training (PGCE) faculty.\n\nFurther on, up the hill, on the London Road, is another element of the campus, in particular the School of Law, which is housed in the Franciscan Building, surrounded by other student accommodation blocks. This is opposite the swimming pool and leisure centre. The university has been expanding in recent years. It has acquired a new site on the west side of the river, which will increase the capacity of the river-side campus as a whole. Teaching on some master's degrees takes place in London, in [[Grosvenor Place]], at the home of one its partner institutions: the [[European School of Economics]], and some Life Science programmes are also run in Central London, in conjunction with Medipathways College (see [[#External degrees and validation|below]]).\n\n==Organisation and governance==\n===Chancellor===\n\nOn 24 February 2020, [[Mary Archer]] was installed as [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the university,<ref>{{cite web |title=Dame Mary Archer appointed new Chancellor of the University of Buckingham |url=https://www.buckinghamtoday.co.uk/news/people/dame-mary-archer-appointed-new-chancellor-university-buckingham-1373931 |website=Buckingham & Winslow Advertiser |accessdate=7 April 2020 |date=23 January 2020}}</ref> replacing [[Tessa Keswick]] who held the position from 2014 to 2020. \n\nFormer Chancellors include [[Lord Tanlaw]] (2010-2013),<ref name=Graduation>{{cite web|url=http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/latest-news/graduation-2013/|title=Graduation 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107175629/http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/latest-news/graduation-2013/|archivedate=7 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Martin Jacomb]] (1999-2010), [[Margaret Thatcher]] (1992-1999), and [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone]].\n\n===Vice-Chancellor===\nSir Anthony Seldon was appointed as [[Chancellor (education)#Vice-chancellor|Vice-Chancellor]] from 1 September 2015 from Wellington College where he was 13th Master.

Each of these is presided over by a dean.\n\nThe quality of the university's provision is maintained, as at other UK universities, by an external examiner system (i.e., professors from other universities oversee and report on exams and marking), by an academic advisory council (comprising a range of subject-specialist academics from other universities), and by membership of the [[Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education]] (QAA).\n\nThe Department of Education has two aspects, research and vocational: it conducts research into education and school provision, and also maintains various PGCE courses for teacher training. The Department of Education has been home to some of the most prominent educationalists in Britain, including the late [[Chris Woodhead]] (former head of [[Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills|Ofsted]]) and [[Anthony O'Hear]] (director of the [[Royal Institute of Philosophy]]). Its [[postgraduate certificate in education]] \u2013 which deals with both the state and the [[independent school (UK)|independent sector]] \u2013 is accredited with [[Qualified Teacher Status]] which means that it also qualifies graduates to teach in the state sector.\n\nThe university was created as a [[liberal arts college]], and still describes itself as such, although in an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2003, then Vice-Chancellor Terence Kealey remarked that it had \"become a vocational school for law and business for non-British students, because that's where the market has taken us\".<ref name=\"woodward20030106\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jan/06/highereducation.education2 |title=Lessons on paying for higher education |last=Woodward |first=Will |date=2003-01-06 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2019-12-05 |last2=editor |first2=education |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Consequently, major humanities subjects such as history and politics are no longer offered as stand-alone degrees, instead being combined with economics as a degree in international studies. Economics, however, is available as a stand-alone degree as is [[English literature]], as a single honours subject, and in combinations with English Language, or Journalism, and related areas. The Professor of Economics, and Dean of Humanities, [[Martin Ricketts]], is the chair of the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]] Academic Advisory Council.\n\nSome degree programmes at Buckingham, Law for example, place greater emphasis on exams as an assessment method rather than coursework, but in general its degree programmes balance assessment between exams and coursework.<ref name=TimesOnline>{{cite news|work=The Times|date=14 February 2008|title=A student's guide to...

For non-EU students, fees are equivalent to \u00a313,500 p.a.\n\nBecause Buckingham's degrees take two years to complete, students view its degrees as cost-effective compared to other UK university courses, once the income from an extra year's employment is taken into account.{{r|woodward20030106}} In some subject areas, notably Humanities, the university is now offering its degrees over different time-scales, i.e., the 2-year 'intensive' model, working the extra summer term per year, and the traditional 3-year model with the usual summer break each year.\n\n===External degrees and validation===\nThe university awards undergraduate and graduate (Masters/MBA) degrees to students who have studied at the [[Sarajevo School of Science and Technology]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe university validates courses in medicine at Medipathways College, a small private college based in London.

This complex contains the main teaching areas for English Literature, English Language, Journalism, Modern Foreign Languages, and the Foundation programmes, and also some of the teaching rooms and one of the lecture theatres for Medicine. It also houses the Ian-Fairburn Lecture Theatre, the largest lecture theatre on the river-side site. Adjacent to the Chandos Building, is the Department of Education. This has both a research arm, and also a teacher training (PGCE) faculty.\n\nFurther on, up the hill, on the London Road, is another element of the campus, in particular the School of Law, which is housed in the Franciscan Building, surrounded by other student accommodation blocks. This is opposite the swimming pool and leisure centre. The university has been expanding in recent years. It has acquired a new site on the west side of the river, which will increase the capacity of the river-side campus as a whole. Teaching on some master's degrees takes place in London, in [[Grosvenor Place]], at the home of one its partner institutions: the [[European School of Economics]], and some Life Science programmes are also run in Central London, in conjunction with Medipathways College (see [[#External degrees and validation|below]]).\n\n==Organisation and governance==\n===Chancellor===\n\nOn 24 February 2020, [[Mary Archer]] was installed as [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the university,<ref>{{cite web |title=Dame Mary Archer appointed new Chancellor of the University of Buckingham |url=https://www.buckinghamtoday.co.uk/news/people/dame-mary-archer-appointed-new-chancellor-university-buckingham-1373931 |website=Buckingham & Winslow Advertiser |accessdate=7 April 2020 |date=23 January 2020}}</ref> replacing [[Tessa Keswick]] who held the position from 2014 to 2020. \n\nFormer Chancellors include [[Lord Tanlaw]] (2010-2013),<ref name=Graduation>{{cite web|url=http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/latest-news/graduation-2013/|title=Graduation 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107175629/http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/latest-news/graduation-2013/|archivedate=7 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Martin Jacomb]] (1999-2010), [[Margaret Thatcher]] (1992-1999), and [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone]].\n\n===Vice-Chancellor===\nSir Anthony Seldon was appointed as [[Chancellor (education)#Vice-chancellor|Vice-Chancellor]] from 1 September 2015 from Wellington College where he was 13th Master.

Each of these is presided over by a dean.\n\nThe quality of the university's provision is maintained, as at other UK universities, by an external examiner system (i.e., professors from other universities oversee and report on exams and marking), by an academic advisory council (comprising a range of subject-specialist academics from other universities), and by membership of the [[Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education]] (QAA).\n\nThe Department of Education has two aspects, research and vocational: it conducts research into education and school provision, and also maintains various PGCE courses for teacher training. The Department of Education has been home to some of the most prominent educationalists in Britain, including the late [[Chris Woodhead]] (former head of [[Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills|Ofsted]]) and [[Anthony O'Hear]] (director of the [[Royal Institute of Philosophy]]). Its [[postgraduate certificate in education]] \u2013 which deals with both the state and the [[independent school (UK)|independent sector]] \u2013 is accredited with [[Qualified Teacher Status]] which means that it also qualifies graduates to teach in the state sector.\n\nThe university was created as a [[liberal arts college]], and still describes itself as such, although in an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2003, then Vice-Chancellor Terence Kealey remarked that it had \"become a vocational school for law and business for non-British students, because that's where the market has taken us\".<ref name=\"woodward20030106\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jan/06/highereducation.education2 |title=Lessons on paying for higher education |last=Woodward |first=Will |date=2003-01-06 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2019-12-05 |last2=editor |first2=education |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Consequently, major humanities subjects such as history and politics are no longer offered as stand-alone degrees, instead being combined with economics as a degree in international studies.

The Professor of Economics, and Dean of Humanities, [[Martin Ricketts]], is the chair of the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]] Academic Advisory Council.\n\nSome degree programmes at Buckingham, Law for example, place greater emphasis on exams as an assessment method rather than coursework, but in general its degree programmes balance assessment between exams and coursework.<ref name=TimesOnline>{{cite news|work=The Times|date=14 February 2008|title=A student's guide to...

{"title_page": "Performance poetry", "text_new": "Ajit kasotiya is born on 8th october,2005 in sahapur,haryana.\nHe was 15(2019) year old.\n\n==History==\nThe term ''performance poetry'' originates from an early press release describing the 1980s performance poet [[Hedwig Gorski]], whose audio recordings achieved success on [[spoken word]] radio programs around the world.<ref>Wheeler, Lesley. ''Voicing American Poetry: Sound and Performance from the 1920s to the Present''. Cornell U P, 2008.</ref> Her band, East of Eden Band, was described{{By whom|date=January 2016}} as the most successful at music and poetry collaborations, allowing cassettes of her live radio broadcast recordings to stay in rotation with popular underground music recordings on some radio stations. Gorski, an art school graduate, tried to come up with a term that would distinguish her text-based vocal performances from [[performance art]], especially the work of performance artists, such as [[Laurie Anderson]], who worked with music at that time. Performance poets relied more on the rhetorical and philosophical expression in their poetics than performance artists, who arose from the visual art genres of painting and sculpture. ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' newspaper, printing Gorski's bi-weekly \"Litera\" column, first published the term \"performance poetry\" to describe the work of Gorski with composer [[D'Jalma Garnier]] III as early as 1982. She began using the term, however, to describe a 1978 \"neo-verse drama\" and \"conceptual spoken poetry for five voices\" titled ''Booby, Mama!'' that employs the cut-up method made popular by [[William Burroughs]] and [[conceptual art]] methods.<ref>''Intoxication: Heathcliff on Powell Street''. College Station, TX: Slough Press, 2007, 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-4276-0475-0}}</ref>\n\nThe [[National Endowment for the Arts]] categorized performance art within the visual arts judging panels; it originally placed performance poetry within the category of theater before correcting it to literature in the 21st century. Since many performance poets did not have publications, the former classification made performance poets categorically ineligible for the NEA fellowship funding or recognition. Their audio cassettes were not acceptable sample material for literature grant consideration. A stated objection to this presentation method protested their performance poems translated into text on paper could not compete with poetry written for print publication. The National Endowment for the Arts is now accepting varied presentations for publication verification for poetry fellowship applicants, including audio recordings that have no printed versions of the poems. Performance poetry with music peaked during the 1980s just as performance art peaked in the 1970s.\n\nDuring that time, San Francisco and New York were the centers for this type of activity; however, [[Austin, Texas]] (The [[Third Coast]]) also had a thriving scene during the 1980s with a coterie of unique characters. Some of the best{{According to whom|date=January 2016}} original Austin performance poets and performing poets who went on to national and international notoriety include Raul Salinas, [[Konstantyn K. Kuzminsky]], Joy Cole, [[Hedwig Gorski]], [[Roxy Gordon]], Ricardo Sanchez, [[Harryette Mullen]], who was nominated for the National Book Award. The Austin Poets Audio Anthology Project, a public arts project, recorded them for radio broadcasts. There were many others, though, and Hedwig Gorski once wrote in \"Litera\" that some were \"eerie\", a word used by one newspaper reviewer to describe Gorski's vocals on the East of Eden Band track \"There's Always Something That Can Make You Happy\".  Other performing writers in the robust literary scene of the Austin area during that time when performance poetry turned into a school of poetry included Pat Littledog, Eleanor Crockett, Jim Ryan, Chuck Taylor, Greg Gauntner, [[Albert Huffstickler]], W. Joe Hoppe, Andy Clausen, poet and playwright [[Isabella Russell-Ides]] (''Getting Dangerously Close To Myself'', Slough Press)  and [[David Jewell (poet)]]; most recorded on [[Hedwig Gorski]]'s audio anthology project.\n\nJewell deserves special mention as a transitional figure, younger than the aforementioned, and one not especially rooted in the Beats like Gorski who has strong connections to [[Ginsberg]], [[Gregory Corso|Corso]], [[Gary Snyder]], and others. By the 1990s the general poetry public was less interested in the Beat Poets of the 1950s and 1960s. They were looking for something fresher, newer, hipper, more in touch with the times in which they were living. Performance poets established clubs, cafes, and media as venues that later became stages for the emerging slam poetry scene. Unlike Gorski, who with East of Eden Band, began broadcasting live performance poetry on [[radio]] <ref>Wheeler, Lesley. ''Voicing American Poetry: Sound and Performance from the 1920s to the Present. Cornell U P, 2008.''</ref> and distributing the recordings of these broadcasts in place of publishing in print, Jewell and [[Poetry slam|slam]] poets were more interested in small live audiences. Venues like [[Nuyorican Poets Cafe]] in [[New York City]] and mass media formats, like Gorski's and [[John Giorno]]'s, form the two lines of influence leading to [[Def Poetry]] on [[HBO]].\n[[File:Galway Kinnell Grindstone Cafe Lyndonville VT March 2013.jpg|173px|thumbnail|right|[[Galway Kinnell]] performing a poetic piece in [[Vermont]]]]\nPerforming poets-writers and especially performance poets excelled in the ability to put the event of oral literature into the primary social/communicative function for literature. The plurality of the literary performance is under the control of the poet/writer, and the performer never minimizes the participation of the [[audience]] members. It is important to remember that performance was the primary distribution method for poetics since tribal times and ancient [[Greece]]. As Gorski often states, broadcast and technology surpass books in reaching mass audiences for poetry, and just as writing poetry for print made poetry a completely different artform since the invention of the [[book]], audio \"mediums influence the way poets write just as they do painters and sculptors\".<ref>http://hedwiggorski.com</ref>\n\nToday, performance poetry is also being used as a means to promote literacy in public school systems.

It began with the performance of oral poems in pre-literate societies. By definition, these poems were transmitted orally from performer to performer and were constructed using devices such as repetition, [[alliteration]], [[rhyme]] and [[kenning]]s to facilitate memorization and recall. The performer \"composed\" the poem from memory, using the version they had learned as a kind of mental template. This process allowed the performer to add their own flavor to the poem in question, although fidelity to the traditional versions of the poems was generally favored.\n\n==Advent of printing==\nAlthough popular works, including popular poems or collections of poems, were already being distributed for private reading and study in manuscript form, there can be little doubt that the introduction of cheap printing technologies accelerated this trend considerably. The result was a change in the poet's role in society. From having been an entertainer, the poet became primarily a provider of written texts for private readings. The public performance of poetry became generally restricted, at least in a European context, to the staging of [[Theatre|plays]] in [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] and occasionally, for example in the cases of the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] [[madrigal (music)|madrigalists]] or [[Robert Burns]], as texts for singing. Apart from this, the performance of poetry was restricted to reading aloud from printed books within families or groups of friends.\n\n==20th century==\nThe early years of the 20th century saw a general questioning of artistic forms and conventions. Poets like [[Basil Bunting]] and [[Louis Zukofsky]] called for a renewed emphasis on poetry as sound. Bunting in particular argued that the poem on the page was like a musical score; not fully intelligible until manifested through sound. This attitude to poetry helped to encourage an environment in which poetry readings were fostered. This was reinforced by [[Charles Olson]]'s call for a poetic line based on human breath. [[Clive Sansom]] devoted much of his life to gathering and contributing poetry and drama particularly suited to performance by children.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the American poet [[Cid Corman]] began to experiment with what he called oral poetry. This involved spontaneously composing poems into a tape recorder. [[Allen Ginsberg]] was to take up this practice in the 1960s. [[David Antin]], who heard some of Corman's tapes, took the process one step further. He composed his ''talk-poems'' by improvising in front of an audience. These performances were recorded and the tapes were later transcribed to be published in book form. Around the same time, [[Jerome Rothenberg]] was drawing on his ethnopoetic researches to create poems for ritual performances as [[happening]]s. \n\nThe writers of the [[Beat generation]] held performance events that married poetry and [[jazz]]. In the late 1960s, other poets outside San Francisco and New York City were experimenting with performance pieces. Notable among these was David Franks, at the time a faculty member at the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]]. Franks' work was not poetry recited to a musical counterpoint but literary pieces in which the performance was a necessary and integral part of the work itself.\n\nIn [[British literature|Britain]], sound poets like [[Bob Cobbing]] and [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]] were exploring the possibilities of live performance. Cobbing's groups Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle involved collaborative performance with other poets and musicians and were partly responsible for drawing a number of the poets of the [[British Poetry Revival]] into the performance arena.\n\nMeanwhile, many more mainstream poets in both Britain and the [[Poetry of the United States|United States]] were giving poetry readings, largely to small academic gatherings on university campuses. Poetry readings were given national prominence when [[Robert Frost]] recited \"The Gift Outright\" from memory at the inauguration of [[John F. Kennedy]][http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/robert-frost-reads-at-jfks-inauguration].After that event, spoken word recordings of Frost and other major figures enjoyed increased popularity.\n\n==The 1970s and after==\n{{Original research|section|date=January 2016}}By the 1970s, three main forms of poetry performance had emerged. First was the poetry reading, at which poems that had been written for the page were read to an audience, usually by the author. Poetry readings have become widespread and poetry festivals and reading series are now part of the cultural landscape of most Western societies. However, most people would not consider the poetry readings of this type as part of the performance poetry phenomena.\n\nThis leaves three types of poetry performance: poems written specifically for performance on the [[Jerome Rothenberg]] model and poems like those of [[David Antin]] that are composed during performance. Both these types would generally be considered to constitute performance poetry. Another type based on the Beat method of reading their print poems is poetry with music. The bands with performance poets make spoken vocals an exercise in not singing, but the texts are not categorized as songs. While Ginsberg sang his Blake songs with a harmonium, the original practitioner of this third and most popular type of performance poetry is [[Hedwig Gorski]], who coined the term performance poetry to describe her work with music.<ref>[http://www.hedwiggorski.com]</ref> She is sometimes called a neo-beat, but considers herself an American \"[[futurist]]\". Unlike the [[Beat generation|Beats]], Ginsberg and Kerouac, her poems were written for performance with music that was specifically composed for the poems. Her spoken vocals have come as close to singing as possible without really singing. That is the key to Gorski's performance poetry: the marriage of poetry to music written specifically to fit poems written for vocal performance.<ref>http://eastofedenband.com</ref> The other type of performance poetry Gorski practiced is without music and tied to [[conceptual art]], but that was at appearances in smaller venues that could not accommodate her band.<ref>Documented in JAST during an interview with Robert Creeley on TV, ''Austin Chronicle'', and http://hedwiggorski.com</ref>  Unlike Antin and Cormin, Gorski never improvised text but wrote poetry only for performance while eschewing printed poetry.\n\nIn the U. S., the rise to prominence of the [[Language poets|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E]] poets with their distrust of speech as a basis for poetry has, broadly speaking, meant that performance poetry went out of fashion with the ''[[avant-garde]]''. However, the increasing popularity of open mics, which allow \"unknown\" poets to take the stage and share their own work in 3- to 5-minute increments and of [[poetry slam]]s has meant that performance poetry is now one of the most widespread forms of popular poetry. Chief among the proponents of these new forms of popular poetry were [[Bob Holman]] in New York, [[Marc Smith (American poet)|Marc Smith]] in [[Chicago]] and [[Alan Kaufman (writer)|Alan Kaufman]] in [[San Francisco]].  In the 1990s, the Favorite Poem project of then U.S. Poet Laureate [[Robert Pinsky]] gave new visibility to ordinary Americans reading and performing their favorite poems. Contemporary performance poets are now experimenting with poetry performances adapted to CD, to video, and to Web audiences.\n[[File:A poet and a few enraptured fans.jpg|173px|thumbnail|right|A poet with a few enraptured fans]]\nThe Beat Poets were the first to popularize crossing over into recorded media to distribute their performed poetry. The best-known Beat poet, [[Allen Ginsberg]], followed the lead of fellow Beat, [[Jack Kerouac]], in reciting his work for audio recording. Ginsberg always used music with his readings and often accompanied himself on the [[Pump organ|harmonium]]. Ginsberg put [[William Blake]]'s poems to music and performed them with the harmonium. Even though the Beats did not use the term \"Performance Poetry\" to categorize their work with music and audio recordings, the Beats provided an immediate model for the work of [[Hedwig Gorski]]. She is a Nova Scotia College of Art and Design art school graduate in 1976. The art school was infamous for starting the careers of numerous 1970s performance artists, such as [[Vito Acconci]], known for photographing his bites. It is worth noting that Gorski, who coined the term \"Performance Poetry\" to describe her poems written only for performance,<ref>[http://hedwiggorski.com]</ref> recordings, and broadcast usually with her musical band East of Eden Band,<ref>[http://eastofedenband.com]</ref> is the only woman, besides Patti Smith, in this group of late twentieth-century innovators reviving [[oral poetry]]. Similar to the ancient bards, touring became a widespread means for performance poets and slammers to distribute their work since the 1990s. The [[Poetry Slam]] is a competitive live performance format founded by poet [[Marc Smith (American poet)|Marc Smith]] in Chicago, which has become a hotbed for performance poetry.\n\nPerformance poetry has also been boosted considerably by the appearance of [[Def Jam]]\u2014the [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] recording company helmed by [[Russell Simmons]]\u2014on the scene.  def jam has created a [[Def Poetry|television show]] that showcases performance poets that runs on [[HBO]], as well as a show of performance poets that ran on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] for almost a year and won a [[Tony Award]].\n\n[[Hispanic]] performing artists, such as [[Pedro Pietri]], [[Miguel Algar\u00edn]], [[Giannina Braschi]], and [[Guillermo G\u00f3mez-Pe\u00f1a]], are known for their humorous and politically charged attacks against American imperialism.  Later contemporary [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] poets such as [[Willie Perdomo]], [[Edwin Torres (poet)]] and [[Caridad de la Luz]] would follow in this tradition.\n\nClosely tied to [[Chicano]] poets is the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] poet [[John Trudell]] who recorded and crossed over with his poetry and music [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]]. Trudell arose from the persecution on his reservation by [[FBI]] agents, who allegedly killed his wife and children. Protest is significant with the [[minority group|minority]] practitioners of performance poetry, such as def poets and slammers. This adds to the vitality of American performance poetry and connects to the social protest of [[Beat poets]] like [[Allen Ginsberg]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ake.hacettepe.edu.tr/Install/JASTFiles/jast27.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328094817/http://www.ake.hacettepe.edu.tr/Install/JASTFiles/jast27.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-28 }} TV interview 1982 [[Hedwig Gorski]] and [[Robert Creeley]] discuss Beats in the context of performance poetry.</ref>\n\nIn [[France]], [[:fr:Lucien Suel]], [[:fr:Akenaton (performer)|Akenaton]], and many other represents the way of performance poetry ...\n\n==The United Kingdom==\nIn the United Kingdom, where the influence of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E was more limited, many ''avant-garde'' poets are deeply committed to continuing the performance of Cobbing and his peers. Well-known names include [[cris cheek]] and [[Aaron Williamson]]. The work of UK poet [[Michael Horovitz]] in spreading this tradition in Britain during the early 1960s should also be acknowledged. His ''Live New Departures'' - a touring version of his poetry and arts journal ''New Departures'' (launched 1959) - gave space and opportunities to poets like [[Pete Brown]] and [[Adrian Mitchell]] as these three principals combined performed verse with the backing of jazz musicians like pianist [[Stan Tracey]] and saxophonist [[Bobby Wellins]]. However, the emergence of performed poetry as a popular art form can probably be linked to Allen Ginsberg's stunning performance at the Albert Hall in 1965 at the [[International Poetry Incarnation]]. Horovitz, Brown and Mitchell would join Ginsberg and Beat colleagues Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Gregory Corso and other European poets at that landmark London occasion. These developments were also connected to the emergence of the [[Liverpool Poets]], which referred mainly to the poets [[Roger McGough]], [[Adrian Henri]] and [[Brian Patten]] who fired up audiences across the UK in the 70s and then the likes of [[John Hegley]] emerged in the 80s, influenced as much by [[stand-up comedy]] as a love for wordplay, creating the template for what became recognised as contemporary British performance poetry - a format still exemplified by the work of acts such as [[Murray Lachlan Young]], [[Francesca Beard]] and Gerard McKeown. [[Apples and Snakes]], a collective promoting performance poetry in pubs and at festivals, was started by Mandy Williams, PR Murry and Jane Addison in London in 1982 inspired by the work of New Variety/CAST. They worked with 'ranting poets' such as [[Attila the Stockbroker]] and Seething Wells and other poets and musicians with a political message such as [[Billy Bragg]] and [[Linton Kwesi Johnson]]. Apples and Snakes continues today, 31 years later, as a national organisation. In the 90s, however, in big cities like Manchester and London, a different style emerged that was influenced more by hip hop with much less emphasis on comedy in the manner of Def Poets in the United States. Well-known writers from this evolution include [[Lemn Sissay]] and the late [[Dike Omeje]] from the [[Manchester Performance Poetry Circuit|Manchester scene]] and [[Roger Robinson (poet)|Roger Robinson]] and [[El Crisis]]  from the [[London Performance Poetry Circuit|London circuit]].\n\nOn the experimental front, a number of new initiatives have grown around collaborative stage work using poetry and movement. ''ShadoWork'', for instance, aims to 'disrupt and enrich the conventional regimes of [[author]], [[Book|text]] and [[audience]]' by combining (simple) [[Theatre|theatrical]] movement with the full range of [[Human voice|voice]] and [[Theatre|stage]] in ways designed to draw deeper attention to the text.  Developments such as ''ShadoWork'' represent a 'counter-cultural' mode of performance poetry which shuns bald entertainment value, and others such as the ''Tell Tales'' initiative and Jonzi D's ''Lyrikal Fearta'' (which he calls choreo-poetry<ref>\"A specialist in a form of theatre that he dubs choreo-poetry, Jonzi D has no qualms about shaping what was a street-based art form for the stage.\"[http://www.timeout.com/london/dance/features/4646/-Breakin_Convention--preview.html]</ref>) go even further, extending spoken word to short prose productions and fusing performance poetry with dance.\n\nBritish performance poetry continues to thrive at a grassroots level, with performances in [[Public house|pubs]] and [[theatre]]s, as well as at [[arts festival]]s such as [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] and The [[Edinburgh]] Fringe. Slams as well as open mics for more traditional writers remain popular.

In 2003 the first UK conference of performance poetry, organised by Lucy English, was held at [[Bath Spa University]].

''Intoxication: Heathcliff on Powell Street.'' Slough Press, 2007. {{ISBN|1-4276-0475-4}}</ref> came into popular usage to describe poetry written or composed for performance rather than print distribution, mostly open to improvisation.\n\n==History==\nThe term ''performance poetry'' originates from an early press release describing the 1980s performance poet [[Hedwig Gorski]], whose audio recordings achieved success on [[spoken word]] radio programs around the world.<ref>Wheeler, Lesley. ''Voicing American Poetry: Sound and Performance from the 1920s to the Present''. Cornell U P, 2008.</ref> Her band, East of Eden Band, was described{{By whom|date=January 2016}} as the most successful at music and poetry collaborations, allowing cassettes of her live radio broadcast recordings to stay in rotation with popular underground music recordings on some radio stations. Gorski, an art school graduate, tried to come up with a term that would distinguish her text-based vocal performances from [[performance art]], especially the work of performance artists, such as [[Laurie Anderson]], who worked with music at that time. Performance poets relied more on the rhetorical and philosophical expression in their poetics than performance artists, who arose from the visual art genres of painting and sculpture. ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' newspaper, printing Gorski's bi-weekly \"Litera\" column, first published the term \"performance poetry\" to describe the work of Gorski with composer [[D'Jalma Garnier]] III as early as 1982. She began using the term, however, to describe a 1978 \"neo-verse drama\" and \"conceptual spoken poetry for five voices\" titled ''Booby, Mama!'' that employs the cut-up method made popular by [[William Burroughs]] and [[conceptual art]] methods.<ref>''Intoxication: Heathcliff on Powell Street''. College Station, TX: Slough Press, 2007, 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-4276-0475-0}}</ref>\n\nThe [[National Endowment for the Arts]] categorized performance art within the visual arts judging panels; it originally placed performance poetry within the category of theater before correcting it to literature in the 21st century. Since many performance poets did not have publications, the former classification made performance poets categorically ineligible for the NEA fellowship funding or recognition. Their audio cassettes were not acceptable sample material for literature grant consideration. A stated objection to this presentation method protested their performance poems translated into text on paper could not compete with poetry written for print publication. The National Endowment for the Arts is now accepting varied presentations for publication verification for poetry fellowship applicants, including audio recordings that have no printed versions of the poems. Performance poetry with music peaked during the 1980s just as performance art peaked in the 1970s.\n\nDuring that time, San Francisco and New York were the centers for this type of activity; however, [[Austin, Texas]] (The [[Third Coast]]) also had a thriving scene during the 1980s with a coterie of unique characters. Some of the best{{According to whom|date=January 2016}} original Austin performance poets and performing poets who went on to national and international notoriety include Raul Salinas, [[Konstantyn K. Kuzminsky]], Joy Cole, [[Hedwig Gorski]], [[Roxy Gordon]], Ricardo Sanchez, [[Harryette Mullen]], who was nominated for the National Book Award. The Austin Poets Audio Anthology Project, a public arts project, recorded them for radio broadcasts. There were many others, though, and Hedwig Gorski once wrote in \"Litera\" that some were \"eerie\", a word used by one newspaper reviewer to describe Gorski's vocals on the East of Eden Band track \"There's Always Something That Can Make You Happy\".  Other performing writers in the robust literary scene of the Austin area during that time when performance poetry turned into a school of poetry included Pat Littledog, Eleanor Crockett, Jim Ryan, Chuck Taylor, Greg Gauntner, [[Albert Huffstickler]], W. Joe Hoppe, Andy Clausen, poet and playwright [[Isabella Russell-Ides]] (''Getting Dangerously Close To Myself'', Slough Press)  and [[David Jewell (poet)]]; most recorded on [[Hedwig Gorski]]'s audio anthology project.\n\nJewell deserves special mention as a transitional figure, younger than the aforementioned, and one not especially rooted in the Beats like Gorski who has strong connections to [[Ginsberg]], [[Gregory Corso|Corso]], [[Gary Snyder]], and others. By the 1990s the general poetry public was less interested in the Beat Poets of the 1950s and 1960s. They were looking for something fresher, newer, hipper, more in touch with the times in which they were living. Performance poets established clubs, cafes, and media as venues that later became stages for the emerging slam poetry scene. Unlike Gorski, who with East of Eden Band, began broadcasting live performance poetry on [[radio]] <ref>Wheeler, Lesley. ''Voicing American Poetry: Sound and Performance from the 1920s to the Present. Cornell U P, 2008.''</ref> and distributing the recordings of these broadcasts in place of publishing in print, Jewell and [[Poetry slam|slam]] poets were more interested in small live audiences. Venues like [[Nuyorican Poets Cafe]] in [[New York City]] and mass media formats, like Gorski's and [[John Giorno]]'s, form the two lines of influence leading to [[Def Poetry]] on [[HBO]].\n[[File:Galway Kinnell Grindstone Cafe Lyndonville VT March 2013.jpg|173px|thumbnail|right|[[Galway Kinnell]] performing a poetic piece in [[Vermont]]]]\nPerforming poets-writers and especially performance poets excelled in the ability to put the event of oral literature into the primary social/communicative function for literature. The plurality of the literary performance is under the control of the poet/writer, and the performer never minimizes the participation of the [[audience]] members. It is important to remember that performance was the primary distribution method for poetics since tribal times and ancient [[Greece]].

The [[Poetry Slam]] is a competitive live performance format founded by poet [[Marc Smith (American poet)|Marc Smith]] in Chicago, which has become a hotbed for performance poetry.\n\nPerformance poetry has also been boosted considerably by the appearance of [[Def Jam]]\u2014the [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] recording company helmed by [[Russell Simmons]]\u2014on the scene.  def jam has created a [[Def Poetry|television show]] that showcases performance poets that runs on [[HBO]], as well as a show of performance poets that ran on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] for almost a year and won a [[Tony Award]].\n\n[[Hispanic]] performing artists, such as [[Pedro Pietri]], [[Miguel Algar\u00edn]], [[Giannina Braschi]], and [[Guillermo G\u00f3mez-Pe\u00f1a]], are known for their humorous and politically charged attacks against American imperialism.  Later contemporary [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] poets such as [[Willie Perdomo]], [[Edwin Torres (poet)]] and [[Caridad de la Luz]] would follow in this tradition.\n\nClosely tied to [[Chicano]] poets is the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] poet [[John Trudell]] who recorded and crossed over with his poetry and music [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]]. Trudell arose from the persecution on his reservation by [[FBI]] agents, who allegedly killed his wife and children. Protest is significant with the [[minority group|minority]] practitioners of performance poetry, such as def poets and slammers. This adds to the vitality of American performance poetry and connects to the social protest of [[Beat poets]] like [[Allen Ginsberg]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ake.hacettepe.edu.tr/Install/JASTFiles/jast27.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328094817/http://www.ake.hacettepe.edu.tr/Install/JASTFiles/jast27.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-28 }} TV interview 1982 [[Hedwig Gorski]] and [[Robert Creeley]] discuss Beats in the context of performance poetry.</ref>\n\nIn [[France]], [[:fr:Lucien Suel]], [[:fr:Akenaton (performer)|Akenaton]], and many other represents the way of performance poetry ...\n\n==The United Kingdom==\nIn the United Kingdom, where the influence of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E was more limited, many ''avant-garde'' poets are deeply committed to continuing the performance of Cobbing and his peers. Well-known names include [[cris cheek]] and [[Aaron Williamson]]. The work of UK poet [[Michael Horovitz]] in spreading this tradition in Britain during the early 1960s should also be acknowledged. His ''Live New Departures'' - a touring version of his poetry and arts journal ''New Departures'' (launched 1959) - gave space and opportunities to poets like [[Pete Brown]] and [[Adrian Mitchell]] as these three principals combined performed verse with the backing of jazz musicians like pianist [[Stan Tracey]] and saxophonist [[Bobby Wellins]]. However, the emergence of performed poetry as a popular art form can probably be linked to Allen Ginsberg's stunning performance at the Albert Hall in 1965 at the [[International Poetry Incarnation]]. Horovitz, Brown and Mitchell would join Ginsberg and Beat colleagues Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Gregory Corso and other European poets at that landmark London occasion. These developments were also connected to the emergence of the [[Liverpool Poets]], which referred mainly to the poets [[Roger McGough]], [[Adrian Henri]] and [[Brian Patten]] who fired up audiences across the UK in the 70s and then the likes of [[John Hegley]] emerged in the 80s, influenced as much by [[stand-up comedy]] as a love for wordplay, creating the template for what became recognised as contemporary British performance poetry - a format still exemplified by the work of acts such as [[Murray Lachlan Young]], [[Francesca Beard]] and Gerard McKeown. [[Apples and Snakes]], a collective promoting performance poetry in pubs and at festivals, was started by Mandy Williams, PR Murry and Jane Addison in London in 1982 inspired by the work of New Variety/CAST. They worked with 'ranting poets' such as [[Attila the Stockbroker]] and Seething Wells and other poets and musicians with a political message such as [[Billy Bragg]] and [[Linton Kwesi Johnson]]. Apples and Snakes continues today, 31 years later, as a national organisation. In the 90s, however, in big cities like Manchester and London, a different style emerged that was influenced more by hip hop with much less emphasis on comedy in the manner of Def Poets in the United States. Well-known writers from this evolution include [[Lemn Sissay]] and the late [[Dike Omeje]] from the [[Manchester Performance Poetry Circuit|Manchester scene]] and [[Roger Robinson (poet)|Roger Robinson]] and [[El Crisis]]  from the [[London Performance Poetry Circuit|London circuit]].\n\nOn the experimental front, a number of new initiatives have grown around collaborative stage work using poetry and movement. ''ShadoWork'', for instance, aims to 'disrupt and enrich the conventional regimes of [[author]], [[Book|text]] and [[audience]]' by combining (simple) [[Theatre|theatrical]] movement with the full range of [[Human voice|voice]] and [[Theatre|stage]] in ways designed to draw deeper attention to the text.  Developments such as ''ShadoWork'' represent a 'counter-cultural' mode of performance poetry which shuns bald entertainment value, and others such as the ''Tell Tales'' initiative and Jonzi D's ''Lyrikal Fearta'' (which he calls choreo-poetry<ref>\"A specialist in a form of theatre that he dubs choreo-poetry, Jonzi D has no qualms about shaping what was a street-based art form for the stage.\"[http://www.timeout.com/london/dance/features/4646/-Breakin_Convention--preview.html]</ref>) go even further, extending spoken word to short prose productions and fusing performance poetry with dance.\n\nBritish performance poetry continues to thrive at a grassroots level, with performances in [[Public house|pubs]] and [[theatre]]s, as well as at [[arts festival]]s such as [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] and The [[Edinburgh]] Fringe. Slams as well as open mics for more traditional writers remain popular. Media works influenced by radio performance poet [[Hedwig Gorski]] have gained ground;<ref>Lesley Wheeler, Voicing American Poetry: Sound and Performance from the 1920s to the Present.

It is regarded as the first major chamber work by Poulenc.\n\n== Background and first performance ==\nBy 1924 the 25-year-old Poulenc had become fairly well known in France, and to some extent elsewhere. First as a member of [[Les Six]] around the start of the decade, and then with his music for the ballet ''[[Les biches]]'' in 1924, he had established himself as a rising young composer.<ref>Hell (1959), pp. 17\u201321 and 28</ref> He had composed several chamber works, including the [[Sonata for clarinet and bassoon]] and the [[Sonata for horn, trumpet and trombone]] (both 1922),<ref>Nichols, p. 348</ref> and he began work on a trio for oboe, bassoon and piano in May 1924.<ref name=n62/>{{refn|Early ideas for the trio had begun to form in his mind as early as 1921.<ref name=ns>Simeone, Nigel (2020). Notes to Resonus CD RES10256</ref>|group=n}} He was a slow and painstaking composer, and the piece took him two years to complete.<ref name =n62>Nichols, p. 62</ref> Finally he retreated to a hotel in [[Cannes]] to isolate himself from family and friends while he finished the work. While there he met [[Igor Stravinsky]] who gave him some good advice (\"quelques bons conseils\") that helped him with the final version of the first movement of the new piece.<ref>Car\u00e9, pp. 11\u201312</ref>\n\nPoulenc dedicated the Trio to [[Manuel de Falla]], who was delighted with the work and promised to organise and take part in a performance in Spain as soon as possible.<ref>Car\u00e9, p. 12</ref> The first performance of the Trio was given at the Salle des Agriculteurs in Paris on 2 May 1926 in a concert at which two other Poulenc works, ''Napoli'' and ''[[Chansons gaillardes]]'', were also premiered.<ref name=n71>Nichols, p. 71</ref>{{refn|''Napoli'' was played by [[Marcelle Meyer]] and the chansons were sung by [[Pierre Bernac]].<ref name=n71/>|group=n}} The work was given again the following day.<ref name=men>\"Concerts de la Revue Musicale\", ''[[Le M\u00e9nestrel]]'', 14 May 1926, p. 223</ref>  The players were Roger Lamorlette (oboe), Gustave Dh\u00e9rin (bassoon) and the composer.<ref>Schmidt, p. 149</ref>\n\n== Music ==\nThe Trio is in three movements \u2013 [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|Presto]], [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|Andante]] and [[Rondo]].

He preferred what he called an \"episodic\" style, in which a theme is presented with no development and is followed by a contrasting theme, similarly treated.<ref>Nichols, p. 64</ref> Nevertheless, many years after the work was written, Poulenc told [[Claude Rostand]]:\n{{blockindent|For those who think I don't care about form, I've no objection to unveiling my secrets here: the first movement follows the plan of a [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] Allegro, and the final Rondo the shape of the scherzo in [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Saint-Sa\u00ebns)|Second Piano Concerto]].

It is regarded as the first major chamber work by Poulenc.\n\n== Background and first performance ==\nBy 1924 the 25-year-old Poulenc had become fairly well known in France, and to some extent elsewhere. First as a member of [[Les Six]] around the start of the decade, and then with his music for the ballet ''[[Les biches]]'' in 1924, he had established himself as a rising young composer.<ref>Hell (1959), pp. 17\u201321 and 28</ref> He had composed several chamber works, including the [[Sonata for clarinet and bassoon]] and the [[Sonata for horn, trumpet and trombone]] (both 1922),<ref>Nichols, p. 348</ref> and he began work on a trio for oboe, bassoon and piano in May 1924.<ref name=n62/>{{refn|Early ideas for the trio had begun to form in his mind as early as 1921.<ref name=ns>Simeone, Nigel (2020). Notes to Resonus CD RES10256</ref>|group=n}} He was a slow and painstaking composer, and the piece took him two years to complete.<ref name =n62>Nichols, p. 62</ref> Finally he retreated to a hotel in [[Cannes]] to isolate himself from family and friends while he finished the work. While there he met [[Igor Stravinsky]] who gave him some good advice (\"quelques bons conseils\") that helped him with the final version of the first movement of the new piece.<ref>Car\u00e9, pp. 11\u201312</ref>\n\nPoulenc dedicated the Trio to [[Manuel de Falla]], who was delighted with the work and promised to organise and take part in a performance in Spain as soon as possible.<ref>Car\u00e9, p. 12</ref> The first performance of the Trio was given at the Salle des Agriculteurs in Paris on 2 May 1926 in a concert at which two other Poulenc works, ''Napoli'' and ''[[Chansons gaillardes]]'', were also premiered.<ref name=n71>Nichols, p. 71</ref>{{refn|''Napoli'' was played by [[Marcelle Meyer]] and the chansons were sung by [[Pierre Bernac]].<ref name=n71/>|group=n}} The work was given again the following day.<ref name=men>\"Concerts de la Revue Musicale\", ''[[Le M\u00e9nestrel]]'', 14 May 1926, p. 223</ref>  The players were Roger Lamorlette (oboe), Gustave Dh\u00e9rin (bassoon) and the composer.<ref>Schmidt, p. 149</ref>\n\n== Music ==\nThe Trio is in three movements \u2013 [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|Presto]], [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|Andante]] and [[Rondo]].

He preferred what he called an \"episodic\" style, in which a theme is presented with no development and is followed by a contrasting theme, similarly treated.<ref>Nichols, p. 64</ref> Nevertheless, many years after the work was written, Poulenc told [[Claude Rostand]]:\n{{blockindent|For those who think I don't care about form, I've no objection to unveiling my secrets here: the first movement follows the plan of a [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] Allegro, and the final Rondo the shape of the scherzo in [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Saint-Sa\u00ebns)|Second Piano Concerto]].

Within all of these perspectives, adolescence is viewed as a transitional period between childhood and adulthood, whose cultural purpose is the preparation of children for adult roles.<ref>Larson, R., & Wilson, S. (2004). Adolescence across place and time: Globalization and the changing pathways to adulthood. In R. Lerner and L. Steinberg Handbook of adolescent psychology. New York: Wiley</ref> It is a period of multiple transitions involving education, training, employment, and unemployment, as well as transitions from one living circumstance to another.<ref>Coleman, John; Roker, Debi. Psychologist11. 12 (Dec 1998): 593. \"Adolescence\".</ref>\n\nThe end of adolescence and the beginning of adulthood varies by country. Furthermore, even within a single nation, state or culture, there can be different ages at which an individual is considered mature enough for society to entrust them with certain privileges and responsibilities. Such privileges and responsibilities include driving a vehicle, having legal sexual relations, serving in the armed forces or on a jury, purchasing and drinking alcohol, purchase of tobacco products, voting, entering into contracts, finishing certain levels of education, marriage, and accountability for upholding the law. Adolescence is usually accompanied by an increased independence allowed by the parents or legal guardians, including less supervision as compared to preadolescence.\n\nIn studying adolescent development,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Arnett J.

Major pubertal and biological changes include changes to the [[sex organ]]s, height, weight, and [[Muscle|muscle mass]], as well as major changes in brain structure and organization. [[Cognition|Cognitive]] advances encompass both increment in knowledge and in the ability to think abstractly and to reason more effectively. The study of adolescent development often involves interdisciplinary collaborations. For example, researchers in [[neuroscience]] or [[behavioral medicine|bio-behavioral health]] might focus on pubertal changes in brain structure and its effects on cognition or social relations. Sociologists interested in adolescence might focus on the acquisition of social roles (e.g., worker or romantic partner) and how this varies across cultures or social conditions.<ref>C\u00f4t\u00e9, J.

Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.</ref>\n\nPuberty occurs through a long process and begins with a surge in hormone production, which in turn causes a number of physical changes. It is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of [[secondary sex characteristic]]s (for example, a deeper voice and larger [[Adam's apple]] in boys, and development of [[breast]]s and more curved and prominent [[hips]] in girls) and a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state. This is triggered by the [[pituitary gland]], which secretes a surge of [[Hormone|hormonal]] agents into the blood stream, initiating a chain reaction. The male and female [[gonads]] are thereby activated, which puts them into a state of rapid growth and development; the triggered gonads now commence mass production of hormones. The testes primarily release [[testosterone]], and the ovaries predominantly dispense [[estrogen]]. The production of these hormones increases gradually until sexual maturation is met. Some boys may develop [[gynecomastia]] due to an imbalance of [[sex hormone]]s, tissue responsiveness or [[obesity]].<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Nydick M, Bustos J, Dale JH, Rawson RW |title=Gynecomastia in adolescent boys |journal=JAMA |volume=178 |issue= 5|pages=449\u201354 |date=November 1961 |pmid=14480779|doi=10.1001/jama.1961.03040440001001 }}</ref>\n\n[[Facial hair]] in males normally appears in a specific order during puberty: The first facial hair to appear tends to grow at the corners of the upper lip, typically between 14 and 17 years of age.<ref name=\"pamf.org\">{{Cite news|title=Puberty \u2013 Changes for Males|publisher=pamf.org|accessdate=February 20, 2009 |url=http://www.pamf.org/teen/health/puberty/physicalchanges.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090303201905/http://www.pamf.org/teen/health/puberty/physicalchanges.html| archivedate= March 3, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=\"www.ppwr\">{{cite web|title=Getting The Facts: Puberty|publisher=ppwr|accessdate=February 20, 2009|url=http://www.ppwr.on.ca/03_07.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226191204/http://www.ppwr.on.ca/03_07.html|archivedate=February 26, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> It then spreads to form a [[moustache]] over the entire upper lip.

(2008). ''Adolescence''. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref> Males experience their growth spurt about two years later, on average, than females. During their peak height velocity (the time of most rapid growth), adolescents grow at a growth rate nearly identical to that of a toddler\u2014about 10.3&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;inches) per year for males and 9&nbsp;cm (3.5&nbsp;inches) per year for females.<ref name=\"Susman, E. 2004\">Susman, E., & Rogol, A.

The weight gained during adolescence constitutes nearly half of one's adult body weight.<ref name=\"Susman, E. 2004\"/> Teenage and early adult males may continue to gain natural muscle growth even after puberty.<ref name=Garn/>\n\nThe accelerated growth in different body parts happens at different times, but for all adolescents, it has a fairly regular sequence. The first places to grow are the extremities\u2014the head, hands and feet\u2014followed by the arms and legs, then the torso and shoulders.<ref name=\"Tanner, J. 1972\">Tanner, J. (1972). Sequence, tempo, and individual variation in growth and development of boys and girls aged twelve to sixteen. In J. Kagan & R. Coles (Eds.), ''Twelve to sixteen: Early adolescence'', New York: Norton.</ref> This non-uniform growth is one reason why an adolescent body may seem out of proportion.\n\nDuring puberty, bones become harder and more brittle. At the conclusion of puberty, the ends of the long bones close during the process called [[epiphysis]]. There can be ethnic differences in these skeletal changes. For example, in the United States of America, bone density increases significantly more among black than white adolescents, which might account for decreased likelihood of black women developing [[osteoporosis]] and having fewer bone fractures there.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Gilsanz V. |author2=Roe T. |author3=Mora S. |author4=Costin G. |author5=Goodman W. | year = 1991 | title = Changes in vertebral bone density in Black girls and White girls during childhood and puberty | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 325 | issue = 23| pages = 1597\u20131600 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199112053252302 | pmid = 1944449 }}</ref>\n\nAnother set of significant physical changes during puberty happen in bodily distribution of fat and muscle. This process is different for females and males. Before puberty, there are nearly no sex differences in fat and muscle distribution; during puberty, boys grow muscle much faster than girls, although both sexes experience rapid muscle development. In contrast, though both sexes experience an increase in body fat, the increase is much more significant for girls. Frequently, the increase in fat for girls happens in their years just before puberty. The ratio between muscle and fat among post-pubertal boys is around three to one, while for girls it is about five to four. This may help explain sex differences in athletic performance.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Smoll F. |author2=Schutz R. | year = 1990 | title = Quantifying gender differences in physical performance: A developmental perspective | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 360\u2013369 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.26.3.360 }}</ref>\n\nPubertal development also affects [[circulatory system|circulatory]] and [[respiratory system|respiratory]] systems as an adolescents' heart and lungs increase in both size and capacity. These changes lead to increased strength and tolerance for exercise. Sex differences are apparent as males tend to develop \"larger hearts and lungs, higher systolic blood pressure, a lower resting heart rate, a greater capacity for carrying oxygen to the blood, a greater power for neutralizing the chemical products of muscular exercise, higher blood hemoglobin and more red blood cells\".<ref>Peterson, A., & Taylor, B.

In males, the first stages of puberty involve growth of the testes and scrotum, followed by growth of the penis.<ref>Goldstein, B. (1976). ''Introduction to human sexuality''. Belmont, CA: Star.</ref> At the time that the penis develops, the [[seminal vesicle]]s, the [[prostate]], and the [[bulbourethral gland]] also enlarge and develop. The first ejaculation of seminal fluid generally occurs about one year after the beginning of accelerated penis growth, although this is often determined culturally rather than biologically, since for many boys first ejaculation occurs as a result of masturbation.<ref name=\"Tanner, J. 1972\"/> Boys are generally fertile before they have an adult appearance.<ref name=\"Steinberg, L. 2008\"/>\n\nIn females, changes in the primary sex characteristics involve growth of the uterus, vagina, and other aspects of the reproductive system. [[Menarche]], the beginning of menstruation, is a relatively late development which follows a long series of hormonal changes.<ref>{{cite journal |author1 = Dorn L.D. | author2 = Nottelmann E.D. | author3 = Sussman E.J. | author4 = Inoff-Germain G. | author5 = Chrousos G.P. | last6 = Cutler | year = 1999 | title = Variability in hormone concentrations and self-reported menstrual histories in young adolescents: Menarche as an integral part of a developmental process | journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 283\u2013304 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021680726753 }}</ref> Generally, a girl is not fully fertile until several years after menarche, as regular ovulation follows menarche by about two years.<ref>Hafetz, E.

Ann Arbor, MI: Ann Arbor Science Publishers.</ref> Unlike males, therefore, females usually appear physically mature before they are capable of becoming pregnant.\n\nChanges in [[secondary sex characteristic]]s include every change that is not directly related to sexual reproduction. In males, these changes involve appearance of pubic, facial, and body hair, deepening of the voice, roughening of the skin around the upper arms and thighs, and increased development of the sweat glands. In females, secondary sex changes involve elevation of the breasts, widening of the hips, development of pubic and underarm hair, widening of the areolae, and elevation of the nipples.<ref>Steinberg, L. (2008). ''Adolescence'', 8th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref> The changes in secondary sex characteristics that take place during puberty are often referred to in terms of five [[Tanner scale|Tanner stages]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://healthvermont.gov/family/toolkit/tools%5CJ-1%20CARD%20Tanner%20Stages.pdf |title=Tanner stages |accessdate=September 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205151003/http://healthvermont.gov/family/toolkit/tools/J-1%20CARD%20Tanner%20Stages.pdf |archivedate=December 5, 2010 }}</ref> named after the British pediatrician who devised the categorization system.\n\n===Changes in the brain===\nThe human brain is not fully developed by the time a person reaches puberty. Between the ages of 10 and 25, the brain undergoes changes that have important implications for behavior (see [[#Cognitive development|Cognitive development]] below). The brain reaches 90% of its adult size by the time a person is six years of age.<ref name=\"Casey, B. J. 2008\">{{cite journal |author1=Casey B.

However, the [[Gyrification|folding]] in the brain continues to become more complex until the late teens. The biggest changes in the folds during this time occur in the parts of the cortex that process cognitive and emotional information.<ref name=\"Casey, B. J. 2008\"/>\n\nOver the course of adolescence, the amount of [[white matter]] in the brain increases linearly, while the amount of [[grey matter]] in the brain follows an inverted-U pattern.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Giedd|first1=Jay, N|title=Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Adolescent Brain|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|year=2004|volume=1021|issue=1|pages=77\u201385|doi=10.1196/annals.1308.009|pmid=15251877}}</ref> Through a process called [[synaptic pruning]], unnecessary neuronal connections in the brain are eliminated and the amount of grey matter is pared down.

The areas of the brain involved in more complex processes lose matter later in development. These include the lateral and [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] cortices, among other regions.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Gogtay N. |author2=Giedd J. N. |author3=Lusk L. |author4=Hayashi K.

Specifically, developments in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex are important for controlling impulses and planning ahead, while development in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is important for decision making. Changes in the orbitofrontal cortex are important for evaluating rewards and risks.\n\nThree [[neurotransmitter]]s that play important roles in adolescent brain development are [[Glutamic acid|glutamate]], [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]]. Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter. During the synaptic pruning that occurs during adolescence, most of the neural connections that are pruned contain receptors for glutamate or other excitatory neurotransmitters.<ref>Weinberger, D.R., Elvev\u00e5g, B., Giedd, J.N. (2005). The Adolescent Brain: A Work in Progress. ''The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy''.</ref> Because of this, by early adulthood the synaptic balance in the brain is more inhibitory than excitatory.\n\n[[Dopamine]] is associated with pleasure and attuning to the environment during decision-making. During adolescence, dopamine levels in the [[limbic system]] increase and input of dopamine to the prefrontal cortex increases.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Spear L. P. | year = 2000 | title = The adolescent brain and age-related behavioral manifestations | url = http://faculty.weber.edu/eamsel/Classes/Child%203000/Adolescent%20Risk%20taking/Lectures/3-4%20Biological/Spear%20LV%20%20(2000).pdf| journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 417\u2013463 | doi = 10.1016/S0149-7634(00)00014-2 | pmid = 10817843 }}</ref> The balance of excitatory to inhibitory neurotransmitters and increased dopamine activity in adolescence may have implications for adolescent risk-taking and vulnerability to boredom (see [[#Cognitive development|Cognitive development]] below).\n\n[[Serotonin]] is a neuromodulator involved in regulation of mood and behavior. Development in the limbic system plays an important role in determining rewards and punishments and processing emotional experience and social information. Changes in the levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine and [[serotonin]] in the limbic system make adolescents more emotional and more responsive to rewards and stress. The corresponding increase in emotional variability also can increase adolescents' vulnerability. The effect of serotonin is not limited to the limbic system: Several serotonin receptors have their gene expression change dramatically during adolescence, particularly in the human frontal and prefrontal cortex\n.<ref name=\"pmid24721318\">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2014.02.009 |author=Shoval, G. |author2=Bar-Shira O. |author3=Zalsman G. |author4=John J.

The age at which particular changes take place varies between individuals, but the changes discussed below begin at puberty or shortly after that and some skills continue to develop as the adolescent ages. The [[dual systems model]] proposes a maturational imbalance between development of the socioemotional system and cognitive control systems in the brain that contribute to impulsivity and other behaviors characteristic of adolescence.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Laurence|date=April 1, 2010|title=A dual systems model of adolescent risk-taking|journal=Developmental Psychobiology|volume=52|issue=3|pages=216\u2013224|doi=10.1002/dev.20445|pmid=20213754|issn=1098-2302}}</ref>\n\n===Theoretical perspectives===\nThere are at least two major approaches to understanding cognitive change during adolescence. One is the [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist view]] of cognitive development. Based on the work of [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], it takes a quantitative, state-theory approach, hypothesizing that adolescents' cognitive improvement is relatively sudden and drastic. The second is the [[information processing|information-processing perspective]], which derives from the study of artificial intelligence and attempts to explain cognitive development in terms of the growth of specific components of the thinking process.\n\n===Improvements in cognitive ability===\nBy the time individuals have reached age 15 or so, their basic thinking abilities are comparable to those of adults. These improvements occur in five areas during adolescence:\n# Attention: Improvements are seen in [[Attention#Selective attention|selective attention]], the process by which one focuses on one stimulus while tuning out another. [[Attention|Divided attention]], the ability to pay attention to two or more stimuli at the same time, also improves.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Higgins A. |author2=Turnure J. | year = 1984 | title = Distractibility and concentration of attention in children's development | journal = Child Development | volume = 55 | issue = 5| pages = 1799\u20131810 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1984.tb00422.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Schiff A. |author2=Knopf I. | year = 1985 | title = The effects of task demands on attention allocation in children of different ages | journal = Child Development | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 621\u2013630 | doi = 10.2307/1129752 |jstor=1129752 }}</ref>\n# Memory: Improvements are seen in both [[working memory]] and [[long-term memory]].<ref>Keating, D.

(1975). The development of memory: Knowing, knowing about knowing, and knowing how to know. In H. Reese (Ed.), ''Advances in child development and behavior'' (Vol. 10). New York: Academic Press.</ref>\n# [[Metacognition]]: Improved knowledge of their own thinking patterns increase self-control and social insight.\n\nStudies since 2005 indicate that the brain is not fully formed until the early twenties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog-extra/the-adolescent-brain-beyond-raging-hormones|title=The adolescent brain: Beyond raging hormones \u2013 Harvard Health|first=Harvard Health|last=Publishing}}</ref>\n\n===Hypothetical and abstract thinking===\nAdolescents' thinking is less bound to concrete events than that of children: they can contemplate possibilities outside the realm of what currently exists. One manifestation of the adolescent's increased facility with thinking about possibilities is the improvement of skill in [[deductive reasoning]], which leads to the development of hypothetical thinking. This provides the ability to plan ahead, see the future consequences of an action and to provide alternative explanations of events. It also makes adolescents more skilled debaters, as they can reason against a friend's or parent's assumptions. Adolescents also develop a more sophisticated understanding of probability.\n\nThe appearance of more systematic, abstract thinking is another notable aspect of cognitive development during adolescence. For example, adolescents find it easier than children to comprehend the sorts of higher-order abstract logic inherent in puns, proverbs, metaphors, and analogies. Their increased facility permits them to appreciate the ways in which language can be used to convey multiple messages, such as satire, metaphor, and [[sarcasm]]. (Children younger than age nine often cannot comprehend sarcasm at all.)<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Demorest A. |author2=Meyer C. |author3=Phelps E. |author4=Gardner H. |author5=Winner E. | year = 1984 | title = Words speak louder than actions: Understanding deliberately false remarks | journal = Child Development | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 1527\u20131534 | doi=10.2307/1130022 |jstor=1130022 }}</ref> This also permits the application of advanced reasoning and logical processes to social and ideological matters such as interpersonal relationships, politics, philosophy, religion, morality, friendship, faith, fairness, and honesty.\n\n===Metacognition===\nA third gain in cognitive ability involves thinking about thinking itself, a process referred to as [[metacognition]]. It often involves monitoring one's own cognitive activity during the thinking process. Adolescents' improvements in knowledge of their own thinking patterns lead to better self-control and more effective studying. It is also relevant in social cognition, resulting in increased [[introspection]], [[self-consciousness]], and intellectualization (in the sense of thought about one's own thoughts, rather than the Freudian definition as a defense mechanism). Adolescents are much better able than children to understand that people do not have complete control over their mental activity. Being able to introspect may lead to two forms of adolescent egocentrism, which results in two distinct problems in thinking: the [[imaginary audience]] and the [[personal fable]]. These likely peak at age fifteen, along with self-consciousness in general.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Rankin J.L. |author2=Lane D.J. |author3=Gibbons F.X. |author4=Gerrard M. | year = 2004 | title = Adolescent self-consciousness: longitudinal age changes and gender differences in two cohorts | journal = Journal of Research on Adolescence | volume = 14 | pages = 1\u201321 | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-7795.2004.01401001.x }}</ref>\n\nRelated to metacognition and [[abstraction|abstract thought]], perspective-taking involves a more sophisticated [[theory of mind]].<ref>Smetana, J., & Villalobos, M.

(1980) ''The growth of interpersonal understanding: Developmental and clinical analyses''. New York: Academic Press.</ref>\n\n===Relativistic thinking===\nCompared to children, adolescents are more likely to question others' assertions, and less likely to accept facts as absolute truths.

In addressing this question, it is important to distinguish whether adolescents are more likely to engage in risky behaviors (prevalence), whether they make risk-related decisions similarly or differently than adults (cognitive processing perspective), or whether they use the same processes but value different things and thus arrive at different conclusions.\n\nThe behavioral decision-making theory proposes that adolescents and adults both weigh the potential rewards and consequences of an action. However, research has shown that adolescents seem to give more weight to rewards, particularly social rewards, than do adults.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Albert D. |author2=Steinberg L. |year = 2011|title = Judgment and Decision Making in Adolescence| url =https://repository.brynmawr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1053&context=psych_pubs|journal = Journal of Research on Adolescence| volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 211\u2013224 | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00724.x }}</ref>\n\nResearch seems to favor the hypothesis that adolescents and adults think about risk in similar ways, but hold different values and thus come to different conclusions. Some have argued that there may be evolutionary benefits to an increased propensity for risk-taking in adolescence. For example, without a willingness to take risks, teenagers would not have the motivation or confidence necessary to leave their family of origin. In addition, from a population perspective, there is an advantage to having a group of individuals willing to take more risks and try new methods, counterbalancing the more conservative elements more typical of the received knowledge held by older adults.\n\nRisk-taking may also have reproductive advantages: adolescents have a newfound priority in sexual attraction and dating, and risk-taking is required to impress potential mates. Research also indicates that baseline [[sensation seeking]] may affect risk-taking behavior throughout the lifespan.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Johnson C.A. |author2=Xiao L. |author3=Palmer P. |author4=Sun P. |author5=Want Q. |author6=Wei Y. | year = 2008 | title = Affective decision-making deficits, linked to a dysfunctional ventromedial prefrontal cortex, revealed in 10th grade Chinese adolescent binge drinkers | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 46 | issue = 2| pages = 714\u2013726 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.09.012|display-authors=etal | pmid=17996909 | pmc=3498846}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Miller D. |author2=Byrnes J. | year = 1997 | title = The role of contextual and personal factors in children's risk taking | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 33 | issue = 5| pages = 814\u2013823 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.33.5.814 | pmid = 9300214 }}</ref> Given the potential consequences, engaging in sexual behavior is somewhat risky, particularly for adolescents.

Stanley Hall.jpg|thumb|G. Stanley Hall]]\nThe formal study of adolescent psychology began with the publication of [[G. Stanley Hall]]'s \"Adolescence in 1904\". Hall, who was the first president of the [[American Psychological Association]], viewed adolescence primarily as a time of internal turmoil and upheaval ({{Lang|de|sturm und drang|size=90%}}). This understanding of [[youth]] was based on two then-new ways of understanding [[human behavior]]: [[Darwinism|Darwin's evolutionary theory]] and Freud's [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic theory]]. He believed that adolescence was a representation of our human ancestors' phylogenetic shift from being primitive to being civilized. Hall's assertions stood relatively uncontested until the 1950s when psychologists such as [[Erik Erikson]] and [[Anna Freud]] started to formulate their theories about adolescence. Freud believed that the psychological disturbances associated with youth were biologically based and culturally universal while Erikson focused on the dichotomy between [[identity formation]] and role fulfillment.<ref name=\"Lerner, R.M, & Steinberg, L.D. 2004\">{{cite book|title=Handbook of Adolescent Psychology|year=2004|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|location=Hoboken, NJ|author=Lerner, R.M |author2=Steinberg, L.D. |last-author-amp=yes|edition=2}}</ref> Even with their different theories, these three psychologists agreed that adolescence was inherently a time of disturbance and psychological confusion. The less turbulent aspects of adolescence, such as peer relations and cultural influence, were left largely ignored until the 1980s.

The Oakland Growth Study, initiated by Harold Jones and Herbert Stolz in 1931, aimed to study the physical, intellectual, and social development of children in the Oakland area. Data collection began in 1932 and continued until 1981, allowing the researchers to gather longitudinal data on the individuals that extended past adolescence into adulthood.

Elder formulated several descriptive principles of adolescent development. The principle of historical time and place states that an individual's development is shaped by the period and location in which they grow up. The principle of the importance of timing in one's life refers to the different impact that life events have on development based on when in one's life they occur. The idea of linked lives states that one's development is shaped by the interconnected network of relationships of which one is a part and the principle of [[human agency]] asserts that one's life course is constructed via the choices and actions of an individual within the context of their historical period and social network.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Elder|first=Glen|title=The life course as developmental theory|journal=Child Development|date=February 1998|volume=69|issue=1|pages=1\u201312|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1998.tb06128.x|pmid=9499552}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984, the Society for Research on Adolescence (SRA) became the first official organization dedicated to the study of adolescent psychology.

It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This, therefore, has caused various factors to become important during this development.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Furstenberg|first=Frank F.|title=The Sociology of Adolescence and Youth in the 1990s: A Critical Commentary|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|date=November 2000|volume=62|issue=4|pages=896\u2013910|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2000.00896.x}}</ref> So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices,<ref>How do Young Adolescents Cope With Social Problems? An Examination of Social Goals, Coping With Friends, and Social Adjustment. ''Journal of Early Adolescence''.</ref> to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general. An adolescent from an inner city or a crime-driven neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that can be detrimental to their development.  Adolescence is a sensitive period in the development process, and exposure to the wrong things at that time can have a major effect on future decisions.  While children that grow up in nice suburban communities are not exposed to bad environments they are more likely to participate in activities that can benefit their identity and contribute to a more successful identity development.<ref name=\"APA on adolescent environment\"/>\n\n====Sexual orientation and identity====\n[[Sexual orientation]] has been defined as \"an erotic inclination toward people of one or more genders, most often described as sexual or erotic attractions\".<ref name=\"Saewyc\">{{cite journal|last=Saewyc|first=E.M.|title=Research on Adolescent Sexual Orientation: Development, Health Disparities, Stigma, and Resilience|journal=Journal of Research on Adolescence|year=2011|volume=21|issue=1|pages=256\u2013272|doi=10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00727.x|pmid=27099454|pmc=4835230}}</ref> In recent years, psychologists have sought to understand how sexual orientation develops during adolescence.

When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority.<ref>\"Psychology: The Science of Behaviour\" 3rd Canadian Edition</ref><!--citation is inadequately specific e.g. author etc--> As such, they are more likely to derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation), is the major contributor to low self-esteem in adolescent boys. Due to the fact that both men and women happen to have a low self-esteem after ending a romantic relationship, they are prone to other symptoms that is caused by this state. Depression and hopelessness are only two of the various symptoms and it is said that women are twice as likely to experience depression and men are three to four times more likely to commit suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun & Sartorius, 1995).<ref>Osvelia Deeds, Jeannette Delgado, Miguel Diego, Tiffany Field, and Martha Pelaez (2009). \"Adolescence\".</ref>\n\n===Relationships===\n\n====In general====\nThe relationships adolescents have with their peers, family, and members of their social sphere play a vital role in the social development of an adolescent.

Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept of personalities, how they form and why a person has that specific type of personality. \"The use of psychological comparisons could serve both as an index of the growth of an implicit personality theory and as a component process accounting for its creation. In other words, by comparing one person's personality characteristics to another's, we would be setting up the framework for creating a general theory of personality (and,&nbsp;... such a theory would serve as a useful framework for coming to understand specific persons).\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Barenboim|first=Carl|title=The Development of Person Perception in Childhood and Adolescence: From Behavioral Comparisons to Psychological Constructs to Psychological Comparisons|journal=Child Development|volume=52|issue=1|pages=129\u2013144|date=March 1, 1981|doi=10.2307/1129222|jstor=1129222}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> This can be likened to the use of social comparison in developing one's identity and self-concept, which includes ones personality, and underscores the importance of communication, and thus relationships, in one's development.

They also believe students should be able to be tested for STIs. Furthermore, teachers want to address such topics with their students. But, although 9 in 10 [[sex education]] instructors across the country believe that students should be taught about contraceptives in school, over one quarter report receiving explicit instructions from school boards and administrators not to do so.

For example, [[menarche]] (the first menstrual period of a female), or [[semenarche]] (the first ejaculation of a male) are frequent sexual defining points for many cultures. In addition to biological factors, an adolescent's sexual socialization is highly dependent upon whether their culture takes a restrictive or permissive attitude toward teen or premarital sexual activity. In the United States specifically, adolescents are said to have \"raging hormones\" that drive their sexual desires. These sexual desires are then dramatized regarding [[Adolescent sexuality|teen sex]] and seen as \"a site of danger and risk; that such danger and risk is a source of profound worry among adults\".<ref>[Fields, J. (2012). Sexuality Education in the United States: Shared Cultural Ideas across a Political Divide. Retrieved April 28, 2016.]</ref> There is little to no normalization regarding teenagers having sex in the U.S., which causes conflict in how adolescents are taught about [[sex education]]. There is a constant debate about whether [[abstinence-only sex education]] or [[comprehensive sex education]] should be taught in schools and this stems back to whether or not the country it is being taught in is permissive or restrictive. Restrictive cultures overtly discourage sexual activity in unmarried adolescents or until an adolescent undergoes a formal rite of passage. These cultures may attempt to restrict sexual activity by separating males and females throughout their development, or through [[Public humiliation|public shaming]] and physical punishment when sexual activity does occur.<ref name=\"Connolly J 2004\"/><ref name=\"Ford, C. 1951\">Ford, C. & Beach, F.

Less restrictive cultures may tolerate some aspects of adolescent sexuality, while objecting to other aspects.

Other cultures do not object to teenage sexual activity or [[teenage pregnancy]], as long as they occur after marriage.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Steinberg, L. (2011). \"Adolescence\", 9th ed.

While cultural variation exists for legal rights and their corresponding ages, considerable consistency is found across cultures. Furthermore, since the advent of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 (children here defined as under 18), almost every country in the world (except the U.S. and South Sudan) has legally committed to advancing an anti-discriminatory stance towards young people of all ages. This includes protecting children against unchecked [[child labor]], enrollment in the military, prostitution, and pornography.\nIn many societies, those who reach a certain age (often 18, though this varies) are considered to have reached the [[age of majority]] and are legally regarded as [[adults]] who are responsible for their actions. People below this age are considered [[Minor (law)|minors]] or children. A person below the age of majority may gain adult rights through [[Emancipation of minors|legal emancipation]].\n\nThe [[legal working age]] in Western countries is usually 14 to 16, depending on the number of hours and type of employment under consideration. Many countries also specify a minimum [[school leaving age]], at which a person is legally allowed to leave [[compulsory education]]. This age varies greatly cross-culturally, spanning from 10 to 18, which further reflects the diverse ways formal education is viewed in cultures around the world.\n\nIn most democratic countries, a citizen is [[Voting age|eligible to vote]] at age 18. In a minority of countries, the voting age is as low as 16 (for example, Brazil), and at one time was as high as 25 in [[Uzbekistan]].\n\nThe [[age of consent]] to sexual activity varies widely between jurisdictions, ranging from 12 to 20 years, as does the [[marriageable age|age at which people are allowed to marry]].<ref name=\"ageofconsent\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ageofconsent.com/ageofconsent.htm |title=Ageofconsent.com |publisher=Ageofconsent.com |accessdate=September 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023184559/http://www.ageofconsent.com/ageofconsent.htm |archivedate=October 23, 2012 }}</ref> Specific legal ages for adolescents that also vary by culture are enlisting in the military, gambling, and the purchase of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], cigarettes or items with parental advisory labels.\nThe legal coming of age often does not correspond with the sudden realization of autonomy; many adolescents who have legally reached adult age are still dependent on their guardians or peers for emotional and financial support. Nonetheless, new legal privileges converge with shifting social expectations to usher in a phase of heightened independence or social responsibility for most legal adolescents.\n\n====Alcohol and illicit drug use====\n\n=====Prevalence=====\nFollowing a steady decline beginning in the late 1990s up through the mid-2000s and a moderate increase in the early 2010s, illicit drug use among adolescents has roughly plateaued in the U.S.  Aside from alcohol, [[marijuana]] is the most commonly indulged drug habit during adolescent years. Data collected by the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] shows that between the years of 2015 and 2018, past year marijuana usage among 8th graders declined from 11.8% to 10.5%; among 10th grade students, usage rose from 25.4% to 27.50%; and among 12th graders, usage rose slightly from 34.9% to 35.9%.<ref name=\"Abuse\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/trends-statistics/monitoring-future/monitoring-future-study-trends-in-prevalence-various-drugs|title=Monitoring the Future Study: Trends in Prevalence of Various Drugs|last=Abuse|first=National Institute on Drug|website=drugabuse.gov|access-date=July 21, 2019}}</ref> Additionally, while the early 2010s saw a surge in the popularity of [[MDMA]], usage has stabilized with 2.2% of 12th graders using MDMA in the past year in the U.S.<ref name=\"Abuse\"/> The heightened usage of ecstasy most likely ties in at least to some degree with the rising popularity of [[Rave|rave culture]].\n\nOne significant contribution to the increase in teenage [[substance abuse]] is an increase in the availability of [[Prescription drug|prescription medication]]. With an increase in the diagnosis of behavioral and attentional disorders for students, taking pharmaceutical drugs such as Vicodin and Adderall for pleasure has become a prevalent activity among adolescents: 9.9% of high school seniors report having abused prescription drugs within the past year.<ref name=\"Abuse\"/>\n\nIn the U.S., teenage alcohol use rose in the late 2000s and is currently stable at a moderate level.  Out of a polled body of U.S. students age 12\u201318, 8.2% of 8th graders reported having been on at least one occasion having consumed alcohol within the previous month; for 10th graders, the number was 18.6%, and for 12th graders, 30.2%.<ref name=\"NIDA\">[http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/high-school-youth-trends], National Institute of Drug Abuse. (July 2012). \"Drugfacts: High school and youth.\"</ref>  More drastically, cigarette smoking has become a far less prevalent activity among American middle- and high-school students; in fact, a greater number of teens now smoke marijuana than smoke cigarettes, with one recent study showing a respective 23.8% versus 43.6% of surveyed high school seniors.<ref name=\"NIDA\" />  Recent studies have shown that male late adolescents are far more likely to smoke cigarettes rather than females. The study indicated that there was a discernible gender difference in the prevalence of smoking among the students. The finding of the study shows that more males than females began smoking when they were in primary and high schools whereas most females started smoking after high school.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mashamba|first1=Tshilidzi|last2=Mudhovozi|first2=Pilot|last3=Sodi|first3=Tholene|title=Gender differences in cigarette smoking among college students|journal=African Journal for Physical, Health Education, Recreation and Dance|date=September 2012|pages=117\u2013130}}</ref> This may be attributed to recent changing social and political views towards marijuana; issues such as medicinal use and legalization have tended towards painting the drug in a more positive light than historically, while cigarettes continue to be vilified due to associated health risks.\n\nDifferent drug habits often relate to one another in a highly significant manner. It has been demonstrated that adolescents who drink at least to some degree may be as much as sixteen times more likely than non-drinkers to experiment with illicit drugs.<ref name=\"Greenblatt\">{{cite report |author=Greenblatt, Janet C. |year=2000 |title= Patterns of Alcohol Use Among Adolescents and Associations with Emotional and Behavioral Problems|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.365.6700&rep=rep1&type=pdf |publisher=Office of Applied Studies, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration |docket= |access-date=June 29, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n=====Social influence=====\n[[File:Night Life in Cork, Ireland.jpg|thumb|Irish teenagers over 18 hanging around outside a bar.

In fact, studies suggest that more significantly than actual drug norms, an individual's perception of the illicit drug use by friends and peers is highly associated with his or her own habits in substance use during both middle and high school, a relationship that increases in strength over time.<ref name=\"Duan et al\">{{cite journal|last=Duan|first=L.|author2=Chou, C.|author3=Andreeva, V.|author4=Pentz, M.|title=Trajectories of Peer Social Influences as Long-term Predictors of Drug Use from Early Through Late Adolescence|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|date=July 2009|volume=38|issue=3|pages=454\u2013465|doi=10.1007/s10964-008-9310-y|pmid=19636757}}</ref> Whereas social influences on alcohol use and marijuana use tend to work directly in the short term, peer and friend norms on smoking cigarettes in middle school have a profound effect on one's own likelihood to smoke cigarettes well into high school.<ref name=\"Duan et al\" /> Perhaps the strong correlation between peer influence in middle school and cigarette smoking in high school may be explained by the addictive nature of cigarettes, which could lead many students to continue their smoking habits from middle school into late adolescence.\n\n=====Demographic factors=====\nUntil mid-to-late adolescence, boys and girls show relatively little difference in drinking motives.<ref name=\"Kuntsche et al\">{{cite journal|last=Kuntsche|first=E.|author2=Knibbe, R.|author3=Gmel, G.|author4=Engels, R.|title=Who drinks and why?

Greater enhancement motives for alcohol consumption tend to reflect high levels of extraversion and sensation-seeking in individuals; such enjoyment motivation often also indicates low conscientiousness, manifesting in lowered inhibition and a greater tendency towards aggression.  On the other hand, drinking to cope with negative emotional states correlates strongly with high neuroticism and low agreeableness.<ref name=\"Kuntsche et al\" /> Alcohol use as a negative emotion control mechanism often links with many other behavioral and emotional impairments, such as anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem.<ref name=\"Kuntsche et al\" />\n\nResearch has generally shown striking uniformity across different cultures in the motives behind teen alcohol use. Social engagement and personal enjoyment appear to play a fairly universal role in adolescents' decision to drink throughout separate cultural contexts.  Surveys conducted in Argentina, Hong Kong, and Canada have each indicated the most common reason for drinking among adolescents to relate to pleasure and recreation; 80% of Argentinian teens reported drinking for enjoyment, while only 7% drank to improve a bad mood.<ref name=\"Kuntsche et al\" /> The most prevalent answers among Canadian adolescents were to \"get in a party mood,\" 18%; \"because I enjoy it,\" 16%; and \"to get drunk,\" 10%.<ref name=\"Kuntsche et al\" /> In Hong Kong, female participants most frequently reported drinking for social enjoyment, while males most frequently reported drinking to feel the effects of alcohol.<ref name=\"Kuntsche et al\" />\n\n===Media===\n\n====Body image====\n[[File:Ignoring Each Other (33390897436) (cropped).jpg|100px|thumb|A girl looking at her smart phone]]\nMuch research has been conducted on the psychological ramifications of [[body image]] on adolescents.

A young Marine private waits on the beach during the Marine landing. - NARA - 532432 (restored).jpg|thumbnail|160px|A young U.S. Marine in the [[Vietnam War]], 1965]]\nA broad way of defining adolescence is the transition from child-to-adulthood. According to Hogan & Astone (1986), this transition can include markers such as leaving school, starting a full-time job, leaving the home of origin, getting married, and becoming a parent for the first time.<ref>Shanahan, N. (2000). \"Pathways To Adulthood in Changing Societies: Variabilities and Mechanisms in Life Course Perspective\"Annu. Rev. Sociol. 2000.</ref> However, the time frame of this transition varies drastically by culture. In some countries, such as the United States, adolescence can last nearly a decade, but in others, the transition\u2014often in the form of a ceremony\u2014can last for only a few days.<ref>Steinberg, L. (2011). \"Adolescence\", 9th ed. 101. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref>\n\nSome examples of social and religious transition ceremonies that can be found in the U.S., as well as in other cultures around the world, are [[Confirmation]], [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]]s, [[Quincea\u00f1era]]s, [[Sweet sixteen (birthday)|sweet sixteens]], [[cotillion]]s, and [[d\u00e9butante]] balls. In other countries, initiation ceremonies play an important role, marking the transition into adulthood or the entrance into adolescence. This transition may be accompanied by obvious physical changes, which can vary from a change in clothing to tattoos and scarification.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Furthermore, transitions into adulthood may also vary by gender, and specific rituals may be more common for males or for females. This illuminates the extent to which adolescence is, at least in part, a social construction; it takes shape differently depending on the cultural context, and may be enforced more by cultural practices or transitions than by universal chemical or biological physical changes.\n\n==Promoting positive changes in adolescents==\nAt the decision-making point of their lives, youth is susceptible to drug addiction, sexual abuse, peer pressure, violent crimes and other illegal activities. Developmental Intervention Science (DIS) is a fusion of the literature of both developmental and intervention sciences.

Within all of these perspectives, adolescence is viewed as a transitional period between childhood and adulthood, whose cultural purpose is the preparation of children for adult roles.<ref>Larson, R., & Wilson, S. (2004). Adolescence across place and time: Globalization and the changing pathways to adulthood. In R. Lerner and L. Steinberg Handbook of adolescent psychology.

Psychologist11. 12 (Dec 1998): 593. \"Adolescence\".</ref>\n\nThe end of adolescence and the beginning of adulthood varies by country. Furthermore, even within a single nation, state or culture, there can be different ages at which an individual is considered mature enough for society to entrust them with certain privileges and responsibilities. Such privileges and responsibilities include driving a vehicle, having legal sexual relations, serving in the armed forces or on a jury, purchasing and drinking alcohol, purchase of tobacco products, voting, entering into contracts, finishing certain levels of education, marriage, and accountability for upholding the law. Adolescence is usually accompanied by an increased independence allowed by the parents or legal guardians, including less supervision as compared to preadolescence.\n\nIn studying adolescent development,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Arnett J.

Major pubertal and biological changes include changes to the [[sex organ]]s, height, weight, and [[Muscle|muscle mass]], as well as major changes in brain structure and organization. [[Cognition|Cognitive]] advances encompass both increment in knowledge and in the ability to think abstractly and to reason more effectively. The study of adolescent development often involves interdisciplinary collaborations. For example, researchers in [[neuroscience]] or [[behavioral medicine|bio-behavioral health]] might focus on pubertal changes in brain structure and its effects on cognition or social relations. Sociologists interested in adolescence might focus on the acquisition of social roles (e.g., worker or romantic partner) and how this varies across cultures or social conditions.<ref>C\u00f4t\u00e9, J.

It is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of [[secondary sex characteristic]]s (for example, a deeper voice and larger [[Adam's apple]] in boys, and development of [[breast]]s and more curved and prominent [[hips]] in girls) and a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state. This is triggered by the [[pituitary gland]], which secretes a surge of [[Hormone|hormonal]] agents into the blood stream, initiating a chain reaction. The male and female [[gonads]] are thereby activated, which puts them into a state of rapid growth and development; the triggered gonads now commence mass production of hormones. The testes primarily release [[testosterone]], and the ovaries predominantly dispense [[estrogen]]. The production of these hormones increases gradually until sexual maturation is met.

(2008). ''Adolescence''. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref> Males experience their growth spurt about two years later, on average, than females. During their peak height velocity (the time of most rapid growth), adolescents grow at a growth rate nearly identical to that of a toddler\u2014about 10.3&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;inches) per year for males and 9&nbsp;cm (3.5&nbsp;inches) per year for females.<ref name=\"Susman, E. 2004\">Susman, E., & Rogol, A.

The weight gained during adolescence constitutes nearly half of one's adult body weight.<ref name=\"Susman, E. 2004\"/> Teenage and early adult males may continue to gain natural muscle growth even after puberty.<ref name=Garn/>\n\nThe accelerated growth in different body parts happens at different times, but for all adolescents, it has a fairly regular sequence. The first places to grow are the extremities\u2014the head, hands and feet\u2014followed by the arms and legs, then the torso and shoulders.<ref name=\"Tanner, J. 1972\">Tanner, J. (1972). Sequence, tempo, and individual variation in growth and development of boys and girls aged twelve to sixteen. In J. Kagan & R. Coles (Eds.), ''Twelve to sixteen: Early adolescence'', New York: Norton.</ref> This non-uniform growth is one reason why an adolescent body may seem out of proportion.\n\nDuring puberty, bones become harder and more brittle. At the conclusion of puberty, the ends of the long bones close during the process called [[epiphysis]]. There can be ethnic differences in these skeletal changes. For example, in the United States of America, bone density increases significantly more among black than white adolescents, which might account for decreased likelihood of black women developing [[osteoporosis]] and having fewer bone fractures there.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Gilsanz V. |author2=Roe T. |author3=Mora S. |author4=Costin G. |author5=Goodman W. | year = 1991 | title = Changes in vertebral bone density in Black girls and White girls during childhood and puberty | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 325 | issue = 23| pages = 1597\u20131600 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199112053252302 | pmid = 1944449 }}</ref>\n\nAnother set of significant physical changes during puberty happen in bodily distribution of fat and muscle. This process is different for females and males. Before puberty, there are nearly no sex differences in fat and muscle distribution; during puberty, boys grow muscle much faster than girls, although both sexes experience rapid muscle development. In contrast, though both sexes experience an increase in body fat, the increase is much more significant for girls. Frequently, the increase in fat for girls happens in their years just before puberty. The ratio between muscle and fat among post-pubertal boys is around three to one, while for girls it is about five to four. This may help explain sex differences in athletic performance.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Smoll F. |author2=Schutz R. | year = 1990 | title = Quantifying gender differences in physical performance: A developmental perspective | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 360\u2013369 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.26.3.360 }}</ref>\n\nPubertal development also affects [[circulatory system|circulatory]] and [[respiratory system|respiratory]] systems as an adolescents' heart and lungs increase in both size and capacity. These changes lead to increased strength and tolerance for exercise. Sex differences are apparent as males tend to develop \"larger hearts and lungs, higher systolic blood pressure, a lower resting heart rate, a greater capacity for carrying oxygen to the blood, a greater power for neutralizing the chemical products of muscular exercise, higher blood hemoglobin and more red blood cells\".<ref>Peterson, A., & Taylor, B.

In males, the first stages of puberty involve growth of the testes and scrotum, followed by growth of the penis.<ref>Goldstein, B. (1976). ''Introduction to human sexuality''. Belmont, CA: Star.</ref> At the time that the penis develops, the [[seminal vesicle]]s, the [[prostate]], and the [[bulbourethral gland]] also enlarge and develop. The first ejaculation of seminal fluid generally occurs about one year after the beginning of accelerated penis growth, although this is often determined culturally rather than biologically, since for many boys first ejaculation occurs as a result of masturbation.<ref name=\"Tanner, J. 1972\"/> Boys are generally fertile before they have an adult appearance.<ref name=\"Steinberg, L. 2008\"/>\n\nIn females, changes in the primary sex characteristics involve growth of the uterus, vagina, and other aspects of the reproductive system. [[Menarche]], the beginning of menstruation, is a relatively late development which follows a long series of hormonal changes.<ref>{{cite journal |author1 = Dorn L.D. | author2 = Nottelmann E.D. | author3 = Sussman E.J. | author4 = Inoff-Germain G. | author5 = Chrousos G.P. | last6 = Cutler | year = 1999 | title = Variability in hormone concentrations and self-reported menstrual histories in young adolescents: Menarche as an integral part of a developmental process | journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 283\u2013304 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021680726753 }}</ref> Generally, a girl is not fully fertile until several years after menarche, as regular ovulation follows menarche by about two years.<ref>Hafetz, E.

Ann Arbor, MI: Ann Arbor Science Publishers.</ref> Unlike males, therefore, females usually appear physically mature before they are capable of becoming pregnant.\n\nChanges in [[secondary sex characteristic]]s include every change that is not directly related to sexual reproduction. In males, these changes involve appearance of pubic, facial, and body hair, deepening of the voice, roughening of the skin around the upper arms and thighs, and increased development of the sweat glands. In females, secondary sex changes involve elevation of the breasts, widening of the hips, development of pubic and underarm hair, widening of the areolae, and elevation of the nipples.<ref>Steinberg, L. (2008). ''Adolescence'', 8th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref> The changes in secondary sex characteristics that take place during puberty are often referred to in terms of five [[Tanner scale|Tanner stages]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://healthvermont.gov/family/toolkit/tools%5CJ-1%20CARD%20Tanner%20Stages.pdf |title=Tanner stages |accessdate=September 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205151003/http://healthvermont.gov/family/toolkit/tools/J-1%20CARD%20Tanner%20Stages.pdf |archivedate=December 5, 2010 }}</ref> named after the British pediatrician who devised the categorization system.\n\n===Changes in the brain===\nThe human brain is not fully developed by the time a person reaches puberty. Between the ages of 10 and 25, the brain undergoes changes that have important implications for behavior (see [[#Cognitive development|Cognitive development]] below). The brain reaches 90% of its adult size by the time a person is six years of age.<ref name=\"Casey, B. J. 2008\">{{cite journal |author1=Casey B.

However, the [[Gyrification|folding]] in the brain continues to become more complex until the late teens. The biggest changes in the folds during this time occur in the parts of the cortex that process cognitive and emotional information.<ref name=\"Casey, B. J. 2008\"/>\n\nOver the course of adolescence, the amount of [[white matter]] in the brain increases linearly, while the amount of [[grey matter]] in the brain follows an inverted-U pattern.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Giedd|first1=Jay, N|title=Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Adolescent Brain|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|year=2004|volume=1021|issue=1|pages=77\u201385|doi=10.1196/annals.1308.009|pmid=15251877}}</ref> Through a process called [[synaptic pruning]], unnecessary neuronal connections in the brain are eliminated and the amount of grey matter is pared down.

The areas of the brain involved in more complex processes lose matter later in development. These include the lateral and [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] cortices, among other regions.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Gogtay N. |author2=Giedd J. N. |author3=Lusk L. |author4=Hayashi K.

Specifically, developments in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex are important for controlling impulses and planning ahead, while development in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is important for decision making. Changes in the orbitofrontal cortex are important for evaluating rewards and risks.\n\nThree [[neurotransmitter]]s that play important roles in adolescent brain development are [[Glutamic acid|glutamate]], [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]]. Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter. During the synaptic pruning that occurs during adolescence, most of the neural connections that are pruned contain receptors for glutamate or other excitatory neurotransmitters.<ref>Weinberger, D.R., Elvev\u00e5g, B., Giedd, J.N. (2005). The Adolescent Brain: A Work in Progress. ''The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy''.</ref> Because of this, by early adulthood the synaptic balance in the brain is more inhibitory than excitatory.\n\n[[Dopamine]] is associated with pleasure and attuning to the environment during decision-making. During adolescence, dopamine levels in the [[limbic system]] increase and input of dopamine to the prefrontal cortex increases.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Spear L. P. | year = 2000 | title = The adolescent brain and age-related behavioral manifestations | url = http://faculty.weber.edu/eamsel/Classes/Child%203000/Adolescent%20Risk%20taking/Lectures/3-4%20Biological/Spear%20LV%20%20(2000).pdf| journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 417\u2013463 | doi = 10.1016/S0149-7634(00)00014-2 | pmid = 10817843 }}</ref> The balance of excitatory to inhibitory neurotransmitters and increased dopamine activity in adolescence may have implications for adolescent risk-taking and vulnerability to boredom (see [[#Cognitive development|Cognitive development]] below).\n\n[[Serotonin]] is a neuromodulator involved in regulation of mood and behavior. Development in the limbic system plays an important role in determining rewards and punishments and processing emotional experience and social information. Changes in the levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine and [[serotonin]] in the limbic system make adolescents more emotional and more responsive to rewards and stress. The corresponding increase in emotional variability also can increase adolescents' vulnerability. The effect of serotonin is not limited to the limbic system: Several serotonin receptors have their gene expression change dramatically during adolescence, particularly in the human frontal and prefrontal cortex\n.<ref name=\"pmid24721318\">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2014.02.009 |author=Shoval, G. |author2=Bar-Shira O. |author3=Zalsman G. |author4=John J.

The age at which particular changes take place varies between individuals, but the changes discussed below begin at puberty or shortly after that and some skills continue to develop as the adolescent ages. The [[dual systems model]] proposes a maturational imbalance between development of the socioemotional system and cognitive control systems in the brain that contribute to impulsivity and other behaviors characteristic of adolescence.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Laurence|date=April 1, 2010|title=A dual systems model of adolescent risk-taking|journal=Developmental Psychobiology|volume=52|issue=3|pages=216\u2013224|doi=10.1002/dev.20445|pmid=20213754|issn=1098-2302}}</ref>\n\n===Theoretical perspectives===\nThere are at least two major approaches to understanding cognitive change during adolescence. One is the [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist view]] of cognitive development. Based on the work of [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], it takes a quantitative, state-theory approach, hypothesizing that adolescents' cognitive improvement is relatively sudden and drastic. The second is the [[information processing|information-processing perspective]], which derives from the study of artificial intelligence and attempts to explain cognitive development in terms of the growth of specific components of the thinking process.\n\n===Improvements in cognitive ability===\nBy the time individuals have reached age 15 or so, their basic thinking abilities are comparable to those of adults. These improvements occur in five areas during adolescence:\n# Attention: Improvements are seen in [[Attention#Selective attention|selective attention]], the process by which one focuses on one stimulus while tuning out another. [[Attention|Divided attention]], the ability to pay attention to two or more stimuli at the same time, also improves.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Higgins A. |author2=Turnure J. | year = 1984 | title = Distractibility and concentration of attention in children's development | journal = Child Development | volume = 55 | issue = 5| pages = 1799\u20131810 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1984.tb00422.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Schiff A. |author2=Knopf I. | year = 1985 | title = The effects of task demands on attention allocation in children of different ages | journal = Child Development | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 621\u2013630 | doi = 10.2307/1129752 |jstor=1129752 }}</ref>\n# Memory: Improvements are seen in both [[working memory]] and [[long-term memory]].<ref>Keating, D.

(1975). The development of memory: Knowing, knowing about knowing, and knowing how to know. In H. Reese (Ed.), ''Advances in child development and behavior'' (Vol. 10). New York: Academic Press.</ref>\n# [[Metacognition]]: Improved knowledge of their own thinking patterns increase self-control and social insight.\n\nStudies since 2005 indicate that the brain is not fully formed until the early twenties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog-extra/the-adolescent-brain-beyond-raging-hormones|title=The adolescent brain: Beyond raging hormones \u2013 Harvard Health|first=Harvard Health|last=Publishing}}</ref>\n\n===Hypothetical and abstract thinking===\nAdolescents' thinking is less bound to concrete events than that of children: they can contemplate possibilities outside the realm of what currently exists. One manifestation of the adolescent's increased facility with thinking about possibilities is the improvement of skill in [[deductive reasoning]], which leads to the development of hypothetical thinking. This provides the ability to plan ahead, see the future consequences of an action and to provide alternative explanations of events. It also makes adolescents more skilled debaters, as they can reason against a friend's or parent's assumptions. Adolescents also develop a more sophisticated understanding of probability.\n\nThe appearance of more systematic, abstract thinking is another notable aspect of cognitive development during adolescence. For example, adolescents find it easier than children to comprehend the sorts of higher-order abstract logic inherent in puns, proverbs, metaphors, and analogies. Their increased facility permits them to appreciate the ways in which language can be used to convey multiple messages, such as satire, metaphor, and [[sarcasm]]. (Children younger than age nine often cannot comprehend sarcasm at all.)<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Demorest A. |author2=Meyer C. |author3=Phelps E. |author4=Gardner H. |author5=Winner E. | year = 1984 | title = Words speak louder than actions: Understanding deliberately false remarks | journal = Child Development | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 1527\u20131534 | doi=10.2307/1130022 |jstor=1130022 }}</ref> This also permits the application of advanced reasoning and logical processes to social and ideological matters such as interpersonal relationships, politics, philosophy, religion, morality, friendship, faith, fairness, and honesty.\n\n===Metacognition===\nA third gain in cognitive ability involves thinking about thinking itself, a process referred to as [[metacognition]]. It often involves monitoring one's own cognitive activity during the thinking process. Adolescents' improvements in knowledge of their own thinking patterns lead to better self-control and more effective studying. It is also relevant in social cognition, resulting in increased [[introspection]], [[self-consciousness]], and intellectualization (in the sense of thought about one's own thoughts, rather than the Freudian definition as a defense mechanism). Adolescents are much better able than children to understand that people do not have complete control over their mental activity. Being able to introspect may lead to two forms of adolescent egocentrism, which results in two distinct problems in thinking: the [[imaginary audience]] and the [[personal fable]]. These likely peak at age fifteen, along with self-consciousness in general.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Rankin J.L. |author2=Lane D.J. |author3=Gibbons F.X. |author4=Gerrard M. | year = 2004 | title = Adolescent self-consciousness: longitudinal age changes and gender differences in two cohorts | journal = Journal of Research on Adolescence | volume = 14 | pages = 1\u201321 | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-7795.2004.01401001.x }}</ref>\n\nRelated to metacognition and [[abstraction|abstract thought]], perspective-taking involves a more sophisticated [[theory of mind]].<ref>Smetana, J., & Villalobos, M.

(1980) ''The growth of interpersonal understanding: Developmental and clinical analyses''. New York: Academic Press.</ref>\n\n===Relativistic thinking===\nCompared to children, adolescents are more likely to question others' assertions, and less likely to accept facts as absolute truths.

In addressing this question, it is important to distinguish whether adolescents are more likely to engage in risky behaviors (prevalence), whether they make risk-related decisions similarly or differently than adults (cognitive processing perspective), or whether they use the same processes but value different things and thus arrive at different conclusions.\n\nThe behavioral decision-making theory proposes that adolescents and adults both weigh the potential rewards and consequences of an action. However, research has shown that adolescents seem to give more weight to rewards, particularly social rewards, than do adults.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Albert D. |author2=Steinberg L. |year = 2011|title = Judgment and Decision Making in Adolescence| url =https://repository.brynmawr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1053&context=psych_pubs|journal = Journal of Research on Adolescence| volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 211\u2013224 | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00724.x }}</ref>\n\nResearch seems to favor the hypothesis that adolescents and adults think about risk in similar ways, but hold different values and thus come to different conclusions. Some have argued that there may be evolutionary benefits to an increased propensity for risk-taking in adolescence. For example, without a willingness to take risks, teenagers would not have the motivation or confidence necessary to leave their family of origin. In addition, from a population perspective, there is an advantage to having a group of individuals willing to take more risks and try new methods, counterbalancing the more conservative elements more typical of the received knowledge held by older adults.\n\nRisk-taking may also have reproductive advantages: adolescents have a newfound priority in sexual attraction and dating, and risk-taking is required to impress potential mates. Research also indicates that baseline [[sensation seeking]] may affect risk-taking behavior throughout the lifespan.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Johnson C.A. |author2=Xiao L. |author3=Palmer P. |author4=Sun P. |author5=Want Q. |author6=Wei Y. | year = 2008 | title = Affective decision-making deficits, linked to a dysfunctional ventromedial prefrontal cortex, revealed in 10th grade Chinese adolescent binge drinkers | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 46 | issue = 2| pages = 714\u2013726 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.09.012|display-authors=etal | pmid=17996909 | pmc=3498846}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Miller D. |author2=Byrnes J. | year = 1997 | title = The role of contextual and personal factors in children's risk taking | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 33 | issue = 5| pages = 814\u2013823 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.33.5.814 | pmid = 9300214 }}</ref> Given the potential consequences, engaging in sexual behavior is somewhat risky, particularly for adolescents.

Stanley Hall.jpg|thumb|G. Stanley Hall]]\nThe formal study of adolescent psychology began with the publication of [[G. Stanley Hall]]'s \"Adolescence in 1904\". Hall, who was the first president of the [[American Psychological Association]], viewed adolescence primarily as a time of internal turmoil and upheaval ({{Lang|de|sturm und drang|size=90%}}). This understanding of [[youth]] was based on two then-new ways of understanding [[human behavior]]: [[Darwinism|Darwin's evolutionary theory]] and Freud's [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic theory]]. He believed that adolescence was a representation of our human ancestors' phylogenetic shift from being primitive to being civilized. Hall's assertions stood relatively uncontested until the 1950s when psychologists such as [[Erik Erikson]] and [[Anna Freud]] started to formulate their theories about adolescence. Freud believed that the psychological disturbances associated with youth were biologically based and culturally universal while Erikson focused on the dichotomy between [[identity formation]] and role fulfillment.<ref name=\"Lerner, R.M, & Steinberg, L.D. 2004\">{{cite book|title=Handbook of Adolescent Psychology|year=2004|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|location=Hoboken, NJ|author=Lerner, R.M |author2=Steinberg, L.D. |last-author-amp=yes|edition=2}}</ref> Even with their different theories, these three psychologists agreed that adolescence was inherently a time of disturbance and psychological confusion. The less turbulent aspects of adolescence, such as peer relations and cultural influence, were left largely ignored until the 1980s.

The Oakland Growth Study, initiated by Harold Jones and Herbert Stolz in 1931, aimed to study the physical, intellectual, and social development of children in the Oakland area. Data collection began in 1932 and continued until 1981, allowing the researchers to gather longitudinal data on the individuals that extended past adolescence into adulthood.

Elder formulated several descriptive principles of adolescent development. The principle of historical time and place states that an individual's development is shaped by the period and location in which they grow up. The principle of the importance of timing in one's life refers to the different impact that life events have on development based on when in one's life they occur. The idea of linked lives states that one's development is shaped by the interconnected network of relationships of which one is a part and the principle of [[human agency]] asserts that one's life course is constructed via the choices and actions of an individual within the context of their historical period and social network.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Elder|first=Glen|title=The life course as developmental theory|journal=Child Development|date=February 1998|volume=69|issue=1|pages=1\u201312|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1998.tb06128.x|pmid=9499552}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984, the Society for Research on Adolescence (SRA) became the first official organization dedicated to the study of adolescent psychology.

It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This, therefore, has caused various factors to become important during this development.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Furstenberg|first=Frank F.|title=The Sociology of Adolescence and Youth in the 1990s: A Critical Commentary|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|date=November 2000|volume=62|issue=4|pages=896\u2013910|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2000.00896.x}}</ref> So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices,<ref>How do Young Adolescents Cope With Social Problems? An Examination of Social Goals, Coping With Friends, and Social Adjustment. ''Journal of Early Adolescence''.</ref> to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general. An adolescent from an inner city or a crime-driven neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that can be detrimental to their development.  Adolescence is a sensitive period in the development process, and exposure to the wrong things at that time can have a major effect on future decisions.  While children that grow up in nice suburban communities are not exposed to bad environments they are more likely to participate in activities that can benefit their identity and contribute to a more successful identity development.<ref name=\"APA on adolescent environment\"/>\n\n====Sexual orientation and identity====\n[[Sexual orientation]] has been defined as \"an erotic inclination toward people of one or more genders, most often described as sexual or erotic attractions\".<ref name=\"Saewyc\">{{cite journal|last=Saewyc|first=E.M.|title=Research on Adolescent Sexual Orientation: Development, Health Disparities, Stigma, and Resilience|journal=Journal of Research on Adolescence|year=2011|volume=21|issue=1|pages=256\u2013272|doi=10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00727.x|pmid=27099454|pmc=4835230}}</ref> In recent years, psychologists have sought to understand how sexual orientation develops during adolescence.

When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority.<ref>\"Psychology: The Science of Behaviour\" 3rd Canadian Edition</ref><!--citation is inadequately specific e.g. author etc--> As such, they are more likely to derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation), is the major contributor to low self-esteem in adolescent boys. Due to the fact that both men and women happen to have a low self-esteem after ending a romantic relationship, they are prone to other symptoms that is caused by this state. Depression and hopelessness are only two of the various symptoms and it is said that women are twice as likely to experience depression and men are three to four times more likely to commit suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun & Sartorius, 1995).<ref>Osvelia Deeds, Jeannette Delgado, Miguel Diego, Tiffany Field, and Martha Pelaez (2009). \"Adolescence\".</ref>\n\n===Relationships===\n\n====In general====\nThe relationships adolescents have with their peers, family, and members of their social sphere play a vital role in the social development of an adolescent.

Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept of personalities, how they form and why a person has that specific type of personality. \"The use of psychological comparisons could serve both as an index of the growth of an implicit personality theory and as a component process accounting for its creation. In other words, by comparing one person's personality characteristics to another's, we would be setting up the framework for creating a general theory of personality (and,&nbsp;... such a theory would serve as a useful framework for coming to understand specific persons).\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Barenboim|first=Carl|title=The Development of Person Perception in Childhood and Adolescence: From Behavioral Comparisons to Psychological Constructs to Psychological Comparisons|journal=Child Development|volume=52|issue=1|pages=129\u2013144|date=March 1, 1981|doi=10.2307/1129222|jstor=1129222}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> This can be likened to the use of social comparison in developing one's identity and self-concept, which includes ones personality, and underscores the importance of communication, and thus relationships, in one's development.

They also believe students should be able to be tested for STIs. Furthermore, teachers want to address such topics with their students. But, although 9 in 10 [[sex education]] instructors across the country believe that students should be taught about contraceptives in school, over one quarter report receiving explicit instructions from school boards and administrators not to do so.

For example, [[menarche]] (the first menstrual period of a female), or [[semenarche]] (the first ejaculation of a male) are frequent sexual defining points for many cultures. In addition to biological factors, an adolescent's sexual socialization is highly dependent upon whether their culture takes a restrictive or permissive attitude toward teen or premarital sexual activity. In the United States specifically, adolescents are said to have \"raging hormones\" that drive their sexual desires. These sexual desires are then dramatized regarding [[Adolescent sexuality|teen sex]] and seen as \"a site of danger and risk; that such danger and risk is a source of profound worry among adults\".<ref>[Fields, J. (2012). Sexuality Education in the United States: Shared Cultural Ideas across a Political Divide. Retrieved April 28, 2016.]</ref> There is little to no normalization regarding teenagers having sex in the U.S., which causes conflict in how adolescents are taught about [[sex education]]. There is a constant debate about whether [[abstinence-only sex education]] or [[comprehensive sex education]] should be taught in schools and this stems back to whether or not the country it is being taught in is permissive or restrictive. Restrictive cultures overtly discourage sexual activity in unmarried adolescents or until an adolescent undergoes a formal rite of passage. These cultures may attempt to restrict sexual activity by separating males and females throughout their development, or through [[Public humiliation|public shaming]] and physical punishment when sexual activity does occur.<ref name=\"Connolly J 2004\"/><ref name=\"Ford, C. 1951\">Ford, C. & Beach, F.

Less restrictive cultures may tolerate some aspects of adolescent sexuality, while objecting to other aspects.

Other cultures do not object to teenage sexual activity or [[teenage pregnancy]], as long as they occur after marriage.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Steinberg, L. (2011). \"Adolescence\", 9th ed.

While cultural variation exists for legal rights and their corresponding ages, considerable consistency is found across cultures. Furthermore, since the advent of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 (children here defined as under 18), almost every country in the world (except the U.S. and South Sudan) has legally committed to advancing an anti-discriminatory stance towards young people of all ages. This includes protecting children against unchecked [[child labor]], enrollment in the military, prostitution, and pornography.\nIn many societies, those who reach a certain age (often 18, though this varies) are considered to have reached the [[age of majority]] and are legally regarded as [[adults]] who are responsible for their actions. People below this age are considered [[Minor (law)|minors]] or children. A person below the age of majority may gain adult rights through [[Emancipation of minors|legal emancipation]].\n\nThe [[legal working age]] in Western countries is usually 14 to 16, depending on the number of hours and type of employment under consideration. Many countries also specify a minimum [[school leaving age]], at which a person is legally allowed to leave [[compulsory education]]. This age varies greatly cross-culturally, spanning from 10 to 18, which further reflects the diverse ways formal education is viewed in cultures around the world.\n\nIn most democratic countries, a citizen is [[Voting age|eligible to vote]] at age 18. In a minority of countries, the voting age is as low as 16 (for example, Brazil), and at one time was as high as 25 in [[Uzbekistan]].\n\nThe [[age of consent]] to sexual activity varies widely between jurisdictions, ranging from 12 to 20 years, as does the [[marriageable age|age at which people are allowed to marry]].<ref name=\"ageofconsent\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ageofconsent.com/ageofconsent.htm |title=Ageofconsent.com |publisher=Ageofconsent.com |accessdate=September 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023184559/http://www.ageofconsent.com/ageofconsent.htm |archivedate=October 23, 2012 }}</ref> Specific legal ages for adolescents that also vary by culture are enlisting in the military, gambling, and the purchase of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], cigarettes or items with parental advisory labels.\nThe legal coming of age often does not correspond with the sudden realization of autonomy; many adolescents who have legally reached adult age are still dependent on their guardians or peers for emotional and financial support. Nonetheless, new legal privileges converge with shifting social expectations to usher in a phase of heightened independence or social responsibility for most legal adolescents.\n\n====Alcohol and illicit drug use====\n\n=====Prevalence=====\nFollowing a steady decline beginning in the late 1990s up through the mid-2000s and a moderate increase in the early 2010s, illicit drug use among adolescents has roughly plateaued in the U.S.  Aside from alcohol, [[marijuana]] is the most commonly indulged drug habit during adolescent years. Data collected by the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] shows that between the years of 2015 and 2018, past year marijuana usage among 8th graders declined from 11.8% to 10.5%; among 10th grade students, usage rose from 25.4% to 27.50%; and among 12th graders, usage rose slightly from 34.9% to 35.9%.<ref name=\"Abuse\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/trends-statistics/monitoring-future/monitoring-future-study-trends-in-prevalence-various-drugs|title=Monitoring the Future Study: Trends in Prevalence of Various Drugs|last=Abuse|first=National Institute on Drug|website=drugabuse.gov|access-date=July 21, 2019}}</ref> Additionally, while the early 2010s saw a surge in the popularity of [[MDMA]], usage has stabilized with 2.2% of 12th graders using MDMA in the past year in the U.S.<ref name=\"Abuse\"/> The heightened usage of ecstasy most likely ties in at least to some degree with the rising popularity of [[Rave|rave culture]].\n\nOne significant contribution to the increase in teenage [[substance abuse]] is an increase in the availability of [[Prescription drug|prescription medication]]. With an increase in the diagnosis of behavioral and attentional disorders for students, taking pharmaceutical drugs such as Vicodin and Adderall for pleasure has become a prevalent activity among adolescents: 9.9% of high school seniors report having abused prescription drugs within the past year.<ref name=\"Abuse\"/>\n\nIn the U.S., teenage alcohol use rose in the late 2000s and is currently stable at a moderate level.  Out of a polled body of U.S. students age 12\u201318, 8.2% of 8th graders reported having been on at least one occasion having consumed alcohol within the previous month; for 10th graders, the number was 18.6%, and for 12th graders, 30.2%.<ref name=\"NIDA\">[http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/high-school-youth-trends], National Institute of Drug Abuse. (July 2012). \"Drugfacts: High school and youth.\"</ref>  More drastically, cigarette smoking has become a far less prevalent activity among American middle- and high-school students; in fact, a greater number of teens now smoke marijuana than smoke cigarettes, with one recent study showing a respective 23.8% versus 43.6% of surveyed high school seniors.<ref name=\"NIDA\" />  Recent studies have shown that male late adolescents are far more likely to smoke cigarettes rather than females. The study indicated that there was a discernible gender difference in the prevalence of smoking among the students. The finding of the study shows that more males than females began smoking when they were in primary and high schools whereas most females started smoking after high school.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mashamba|first1=Tshilidzi|last2=Mudhovozi|first2=Pilot|last3=Sodi|first3=Tholene|title=Gender differences in cigarette smoking among college students|journal=African Journal for Physical, Health Education, Recreation and Dance|date=September 2012|pages=117\u2013130}}</ref> This may be attributed to recent changing social and political views towards marijuana; issues such as medicinal use and legalization have tended towards painting the drug in a more positive light than historically, while cigarettes continue to be vilified due to associated health risks.\n\nDifferent drug habits often relate to one another in a highly significant manner. It has been demonstrated that adolescents who drink at least to some degree may be as much as sixteen times more likely than non-drinkers to experiment with illicit drugs.<ref name=\"Greenblatt\">{{cite report |author=Greenblatt, Janet C. |year=2000 |title= Patterns of Alcohol Use Among Adolescents and Associations with Emotional and Behavioral Problems|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.365.6700&rep=rep1&type=pdf |publisher=Office of Applied Studies, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration |docket= |access-date=June 29, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n=====Social influence=====\n[[File:Night Life in Cork, Ireland.jpg|thumb|Irish teenagers over 18 hanging around outside a bar.

In fact, studies suggest that more significantly than actual drug norms, an individual's perception of the illicit drug use by friends and peers is highly associated with his or her own habits in substance use during both middle and high school, a relationship that increases in strength over time.<ref name=\"Duan et al\">{{cite journal|last=Duan|first=L.|author2=Chou, C.|author3=Andreeva, V.|author4=Pentz, M.|title=Trajectories of Peer Social Influences as Long-term Predictors of Drug Use from Early Through Late Adolescence|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|date=July 2009|volume=38|issue=3|pages=454\u2013465|doi=10.1007/s10964-008-9310-y|pmid=19636757}}</ref> Whereas social influences on alcohol use and marijuana use tend to work directly in the short term, peer and friend norms on smoking cigarettes in middle school have a profound effect on one's own likelihood to smoke cigarettes well into high school.<ref name=\"Duan et al\" /> Perhaps the strong correlation between peer influence in middle school and cigarette smoking in high school may be explained by the addictive nature of cigarettes, which could lead many students to continue their smoking habits from middle school into late adolescence.\n\n=====Demographic factors=====\nUntil mid-to-late adolescence, boys and girls show relatively little difference in drinking motives.<ref name=\"Kuntsche et al\">{{cite journal|last=Kuntsche|first=E.|author2=Knibbe, R.|author3=Gmel, G.|author4=Engels, R.|title=Who drinks and why?

Greater enhancement motives for alcohol consumption tend to reflect high levels of extraversion and sensation-seeking in individuals; such enjoyment motivation often also indicates low conscientiousness, manifesting in lowered inhibition and a greater tendency towards aggression.  On the other hand, drinking to cope with negative emotional states correlates strongly with high neuroticism and low agreeableness.<ref name=\"Kuntsche et al\" /> Alcohol use as a negative emotion control mechanism often links with many other behavioral and emotional impairments, such as anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem.<ref name=\"Kuntsche et al\" />\n\nResearch has generally shown striking uniformity across different cultures in the motives behind teen alcohol use. Social engagement and personal enjoyment appear to play a fairly universal role in adolescents' decision to drink throughout separate cultural contexts.  Surveys conducted in Argentina, Hong Kong, and Canada have each indicated the most common reason for drinking among adolescents to relate to pleasure and recreation; 80% of Argentinian teens reported drinking for enjoyment, while only 7% drank to improve a bad mood.<ref name=\"Kuntsche et al\" /> The most prevalent answers among Canadian adolescents were to \"get in a party mood,\" 18%; \"because I enjoy it,\" 16%; and \"to get drunk,\" 10%.<ref name=\"Kuntsche et al\" /> In Hong Kong, female participants most frequently reported drinking for social enjoyment, while males most frequently reported drinking to feel the effects of alcohol.<ref name=\"Kuntsche et al\" />\n\n===Media===\n\n====Body image====\n[[File:Ignoring Each Other (33390897436) (cropped).jpg|100px|thumb|A girl looking at her smart phone]]\nMuch research has been conducted on the psychological ramifications of [[body image]] on adolescents.

A young Marine private waits on the beach during the Marine landing. - NARA - 532432 (restored).jpg|thumbnail|160px|A young U.S. Marine in the [[Vietnam War]], 1965]]\nA broad way of defining adolescence is the transition from child-to-adulthood. According to Hogan & Astone (1986), this transition can include markers such as leaving school, starting a full-time job, leaving the home of origin, getting married, and becoming a parent for the first time.<ref>Shanahan, N. (2000). \"Pathways To Adulthood in Changing Societies: Variabilities and Mechanisms in Life Course Perspective\"Annu. Rev. Sociol. 2000.</ref> However, the time frame of this transition varies drastically by culture. In some countries, such as the United States, adolescence can last nearly a decade, but in others, the transition\u2014often in the form of a ceremony\u2014can last for only a few days.<ref>Steinberg, L. (2011). \"Adolescence\", 9th ed. 101. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref>\n\nSome examples of social and religious transition ceremonies that can be found in the U.S., as well as in other cultures around the world, are [[Confirmation]], [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]]s, [[Quincea\u00f1era]]s, [[Sweet sixteen (birthday)|sweet sixteens]], [[cotillion]]s, and [[d\u00e9butante]] balls. In other countries, initiation ceremonies play an important role, marking the transition into adulthood or the entrance into adolescence. This transition may be accompanied by obvious physical changes, which can vary from a change in clothing to tattoos and scarification.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Furthermore, transitions into adulthood may also vary by gender, and specific rituals may be more common for males or for females. This illuminates the extent to which adolescence is, at least in part, a social construction; it takes shape differently depending on the cultural context, and may be enforced more by cultural practices or transitions than by universal chemical or biological physical changes.\n\n==Promoting positive changes in adolescents==\nAt the decision-making point of their lives, youth is susceptible to drug addiction, sexual abuse, peer pressure, violent crimes and other illegal activities. Developmental Intervention Science (DIS) is a fusion of the literature of both developmental and intervention sciences.

These people tend to support the notion that a more interconnected brain makes more precise distinctions (citing [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov]]'s comparisons of [[conditioned reflex]]es in different species) and that there is a [[critical phenomena|non-arbitrary threshold]] at which distinctions become sufficiently precise to correct assumptions afterward as opposed to being ultimately dependent on exterior assumptions for communication. They argue that this threshold is the one at which an individual is objectively capable of speaking for himself or herself, as opposed to culturally arbitrary measures of \"maturity\" which often treat this ability as a sign of \"immaturity\" merely because it leads to questioning of authorities. These people also stress the low probability of the threshold being reached at a birthday, and instead advocate non-chronological emancipation at the threshold of afterward correction of assumptions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Paul|first=Richard W.|year=1988|title=Ethics without Indoctrination.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ373375|journal=Educational Leadership|volume=45|issue=8|pages=10\u201319}}</ref> They sometimes cite similarities between \"adolescent\" behavior and [[KZ syndrome]] (inmate behavior in adults in prison camps) such as aggression being explainable by oppression and \"immature\" financial or other risk behavior being explainable by a way out of captivity being more worth to captive people than any incremental improvement in captivity, and argue that this theory successfully predicted remaining \"immature\" behavior after reaching the [[age of majority]] by means of longer-term traumatization. In this context, they refer to the [[fallibility]] of official assumptions about what is good or bad for an individual, concluding that [[paternalism|paternalistic]] \"rights\" may harm the individual.

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|5.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''). It initially ran from Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to OMSI via the Pearl District. It was re-branded to its current name upon the opening of Tilikum Crossing bridge in 2015.<ref name=\"PS-Loop\">{{cite web|title=Portland Streetcar Loop Service |url=http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |publisher=[[Portland Streetcar]] |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806004043/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |archivedate=August 6, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|5.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''). It initially ran from Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to OMSI via the Pearl District. It was re-branded to its current name upon the opening of Tilikum Crossing bridge in 2015.<ref name=\"PS-Loop\">{{cite web|title=Portland Streetcar Loop Service |url=http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |publisher=[[Portland Streetcar]] |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806004043/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |archivedate=August 6, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].
