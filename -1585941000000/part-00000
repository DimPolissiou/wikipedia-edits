It was produced in commemoration of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog|''Sonic'' series]]' 15th anniversary, and intended as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] for the [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|seventh generation video game consoles]]. Players control [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Shadow the Hedgehog|Shadow]], and new character [[Silver the Hedgehog|Silver]], who battle Solaris, an ancient evil pursued by [[Doctor Eggman]]. Each playable character has his own campaign and abilities, and must complete [[Level (video gaming)|level]]s, explore [[Hub level system|hub worlds]] and fight [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]] to advance the story. In [[multiplayer]] modes, players can work cooperatively to collect [[Chaos Emeralds]] or race to the end of a level.\n\nDevelopment began in 2004, led by ''Sonic'' co-creator [[Yuji Naka]]. Sonic Team sought to create an appealing game in the vein of [[superhero film]]s like ''[[Batman Begins]]'', hoping it would advance the series with a realistic tone and multiple gameplay styles. Problems developed after Naka resigned to form his own company, [[Prope]]. The team split to work on the [[Wii]] game ''[[Sonic and the Secret Rings]]'' (2007), resulting in ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' being rushed for the [[holiday season]]. It was released for [[Xbox 360]] in November 2006 and for [[PlayStation 3]] the following month. Versions for Wii and [[Windows]] were canceled. [[Downloadable content]] featuring new [[single-player]] modes was released in 2007.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' received praise in prerelease showings, as journalists believed it could return to the series' roots after years of mixed reviews. However, it was [[List of video games notable for negative reception|a critical failure]]. Reviewers criticized its loading times, camera system, story, stability, and controls. It has been frequently described as the worst game in the series. In 2010, Sega delisted ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' from retailers, following its decision to remove all ''Sonic'' games with below-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand. Its failure led to a rethinking of the series' direction; future games ignored its tone and most characters.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe gameplay is garbage.\n\n<br />\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please do not expand the plot beyond this. Thank you. -->\n[[Doctor Eggman]] kidnaps Princess Elise of Soleanna in the hopes of harnessing the Flames of Disaster, a destructive power sealed within her. Aided by his friends Tails and Knuckles, Sonic works to protect Elise from Eggman. Meanwhile, Shadow and his fellow agent Rouge accidentally release an evil spirit, Mephiles. The spirit transports them to a [[post-apocalyptic]] future ravaged by a demonic monster, Iblis. When Mephiles meets survivors Silver and Blaze, he fools them into thinking Sonic is the cause of this destruction and sends them to the present to kill him.\n\nThroughout the story, Sonic and friends travel between the past, present, and future in their efforts to stop Mephiles and Iblis and protect Elise from Doctor Eggman. Though at first Silver stalks Sonic and impedes his attempts to save Elise, Shadow reveals to him that Sonic is not the cause of his world's suffering but rather Mephiles, who is trying to change the past for his own evil purposes. They learn that Mephiles seeks to bond with Iblis, who was sealed within Elise as a child, as they are the two halves of Soleanna's omnipotent god, Solaris. Mephiles eventually succeeds after killing Sonic to make Elise cry over his death, releasing her seal on Iblis and merging with him to become Solaris, who then attempts to consume time itself. The heroes use the power of the Chaos Emeralds to revive Sonic, and he, Shadow, and Silver transform into their [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Super transformation|super forms]] to defeat Solaris. Sonic and Elise are brought to the past and extinguish Solaris's flame, removing the god from existence and preventing the previous events from ever occurring.<ref>{{cite video game|quote='''Elise:''' This is where everything began.

It was produced in commemoration of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog|''Sonic'' series]]' 15th anniversary, and intended as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] for the [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|seventh generation video game consoles]]. Players control [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Shadow the Hedgehog|Shadow]], and new character [[Silver the Hedgehog|Silver]], who battle Solaris, an ancient evil pursued by [[Doctor Eggman]]. Each playable character has his own campaign and abilities, and must complete [[Level (video gaming)|level]]s, explore [[Hub level system|hub worlds]] and fight [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]] to advance the story. In [[multiplayer]] modes, players can work cooperatively to collect [[Chaos Emeralds]] or race to the end of a level.\n\nDevelopment began in 2004, led by ''Sonic'' co-creator [[Yuji Naka]]. Sonic Team sought to create an appealing game in the vein of [[superhero film]]s like ''[[Batman Begins]]'', hoping it would advance the series with a realistic tone and multiple gameplay styles. Problems developed after Naka resigned to form his own company, [[Prope]]. The team split to work on the [[Wii]] game ''[[Sonic and the Secret Rings]]'' (2007), resulting in ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' being rushed for the [[holiday season]]. It was released for [[Xbox 360]] in November 2006 and for [[PlayStation 3]] the following month. Versions for Wii and [[Windows]] were canceled. [[Downloadable content]] featuring new [[single-player]] modes was released in 2007.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' received praise in prerelease showings, as journalists believed it could return to the series' roots after years of mixed reviews. However, it was [[List of video games notable for negative reception|a critical failure]]. Reviewers criticized its loading times, camera system, story, stability, and controls. It has been frequently described as the worst game in the series. In 2010, Sega delisted ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' from retailers, following its decision to remove all ''Sonic'' games with below-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand. Its failure led to a rethinking of the series' direction; future games ignored its tone and most characters.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sonic 06 gameplay.jpg|left|thumbnail|alt=Screenshot of Wave Ocean, the first level of Sonic's campaign in Sonic the Hedgehog; this particular screen shows Sonic running at full speed while dodging obstacles.

Aided by his friends Tails and Knuckles, Sonic works to protect Elise from Eggman. Meanwhile, Shadow and his fellow agent Rouge accidentally release an evil spirit, Mephiles. The spirit transports them to a [[post-apocalyptic]] future ravaged by a demonic monster, Iblis. When Mephiles meets survivors Silver and Blaze, he fools them into thinking Sonic is the cause of this destruction and sends them to the present to kill him.\n\nThroughout the story, Sonic and friends travel between the past, present, and future in their efforts to stop Mephiles and Iblis and protect Elise from Doctor Eggman. Though at first Silver stalks Sonic and impedes his attempts to save Elise, Shadow reveals to him that Sonic is not the cause of his world's suffering but rather Mephiles, who is trying to change the past for his own evil purposes. They learn that Mephiles seeks to bond with Iblis, who was sealed within Elise as a child, as they are the two halves of Soleanna's omnipotent god, Solaris. Mephiles eventually succeeds after killing Sonic to make Elise cry over his death, releasing her seal on Iblis and merging with him to become Solaris, who then attempts to consume time itself. The heroes use the power of the Chaos Emeralds to revive Sonic, and he, Shadow, and Silver transform into their [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Super transformation|super forms]] to defeat Solaris.

The series' creators, [[Phil Baker and Drew Vaupen]], wanted to create a program that would appeal to entire families, not just children. It focuses on the Duncan family of [[Denver]] as they adjust to the births of their fourth and fifth children, Charlotte \"Charlie\" ([[#Mia Talerico|Mia Talerico]]) and Toby (Logan Moreau). In each episode, Teddy Duncan ([[Bridgit Mendler]]) adds to a video diary that contains advice for Charlie about their family and life as a teenager. Teddy tries to show Charlie what she might go through when she is older for future reference. Each video diary ends with Teddy (or another family member, even Charlie) saying the eponymous phrase, \"''Good luck, Charlie''\".\n\nAmong other decisions, executives included adult-centric scenes and changed the series title from ''Oops'' to ''Love, Teddy'' and finally to ''Good Luck Charlie'' in order to ensure the series would appeal to all family members.

Feeling that she will not be around as much when Charlie is grown, she produces and directs video diaries for her, hoping they will give her advice that will help her be successful as a teenager. She produces these video diaries at the end of every episode, and at the end of every video diary she says \"Good luck Charlie\". Her best friend is Ivy Wentz. It was mentioned in \"Sun Show: Part 1\", that her parents were expecting a boy, hence the generally masculine name \"Teddy\". She dated Spencer Walsh in season one, but they broke up after she caught him two-timing both her and a pretty, dim-witted brunette named Skyler, breaking her heart. She and Skyler later become friends. She and Spencer get back together in season two. Throughout the show Teddy has had numerous boyfriends. Teddy shows much care towards her brothers, such as saving PJ from falling out of the treehouse window, or offering to help Gabe deal with Jo, who has given him a black eye. Teddy's best friend Ivy often calls her G.G. for \"goody-goody.\" She and Spencer get back together in \"Can You Keep A Secret?\". In \"All Fall Down\" Teddy and Spencer break up because they don't want to be in a long-distance relationship while Spencer attends the Boston Institute for Performing Arts (BIPA). But when Bob's newest employee Beau admits that he likes Teddy, they begin dating. The two break up when he decides to move home. In \"Accepted\", Teddy finds out that she is on the waiting list for Yale after Victor; later she is accepted. Later in the last episode, Spencer and Teddy get back together and kiss, and she shoots the final entry in her video diary before leaving for Yale.

She worked as a hospital nurse and is often portrayed as dutiful, protective and comedic. She loves her family and does everything to care for and protect them. She appears out-of-her-element when she isn't nurturing them, especially Charlie, but as the series progresses, she begins to feel assured that her youngest children are in good hands and trusts that her husband and 3 eldest children can look after Charlie and Toby. She is notoriously conceited and enjoys bragging about her accomplishments, be they admirable, real, or otherwise. Amy used to be on the local news team and was also a poet in her high-school days. A running gag on the show is that she was involved in virtually every extracurricular activity at Southwest Denver Community College but still earned a nursing degree. She lets special opportunities, such as being on TV or singing in front of a group, go to her head. She has a habit of taking any chance of any publicity that may shine on her family to focus onto her, but this never works out well; usually she ends up being cut from the project or tossed out of certain groups. Amy seldom accepts her children's misbehavior. It is revealed in the [[Good Luck Charlie, It's Christmas!|movie]], that she is pregnant again with her fifth child. In the middle of the third season, Amy quit her nursing job to be a stay-at-home mother to Charlie and Toby. In the final episode, Amy is chosen to be the new anchor on \"Good Morning, Denver\", thanks to Charlie calling in during her on-air audition.\n; {{visible anchor|Gabe Duncan}} :Gabriel<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Charlie Did It!|episodelink=List of Good Luck Charlie episodes#ep6|series=Good Luck Charlie|network=[[Disney Channel]]|airdate=May 9, 2010|season=1|number=6|minutes=06:38}}</ref> \"Gabe\" Duncan ([[Bradley Steven Perry]]) is the middle Duncan sibling, being both the younger brother of Teddy and PJ and the older brother of Charlie and Toby. From the beginning Gabe doesn't approve of Charlie's arrival and is the last one of the family to get used to her, but finally he reaches the point of reluctantly assisting in her care and demonstrating some fondness of her. He is a prankster and troublemaker, (a [[teenage rebellion|rebellious teenager]]) often sarcastic and lazy, but can also be dutiful and determined at times. He is front-man when it comes to the Duncans' running rivalry with their neighbor Mrs. Dabney, who is often the target of Gabe's pranks and stunts\u2014which is the only time the family doesn't mind them. Although he doesn't like Mrs. Dabney, he ends up dating a relative of Mrs. Dabney, Lauren. He and Toby are the only brown-haired Duncans; all of the others are blondes. A running gag in the show is that he insults Bob's weight and baldness, Amy's cooking, PJ being a goofball, Teddy being a \"goody-goody,\" and occasionally Charlie. He also likes to harass and tease Mrs. Dabney, whom he finds annoying. He also won the right to name his baby brother Toby; in one episode, he tried to impress a girl by making video diaries for Toby, ending them with \"Good Fortune, Toby!\". It has been revealed that Gabe was a calm and docile baby.\n; {{visible anchor|Charlie Duncan}} :Charlotte \"Charlie\" Duncan ([[#Mia Talerico|Mia Talerico]]) is the title character and the second-youngest Duncan sibling. She is generally portrayed as being happy. It sometimes takes a few tries to get her to do the right thing. Charlie can also be mischievous at times. Many of the Duncan family's adventures revolve around Charlie. Both her older brothers, PJ and Gabe, are often seen using Charlie for their own benefit, although PJ shows that he cares about her deeply. Gabe seems to dislike Charlie the most although, in some episodes, he is seen being quite fond of her. Amy thinks of Charlie as the perfect baby. It was revealed in \"Charlie is 1\", that it was Teddy's idea to nickname her Charlie. Charlie speaks more often in later episodes of seasons two and three. Toby was born on her birthday; she responded to this by \"I like this present.\" In season three, her personality begins to develop, as she is seen as sneaky and mischievous, such as pretending to like a doll Amy bought for her to like Toby, then throwing it away when she was not looking; and also telling Amy's \"friends\" what she really thinks of them, causing her to lose them all. Also, she can be seen as not liking Toby as in the episode \"Doppel Date\" when she asks Bob if Toby is going to stay at the hotel and he says no and Charlie asks if they can talk about it.\n; {{visible anchor|Bob Duncan}} :Bob William Duncan<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Amy Needs a Shower|episodelink=List of Good Luck Charlie episodes#ep59|series=Good Luck Charlie|network=[[Disney Channel]]|airdate=May 13, 2012|season=3|number=3|minutes=15:30}}</ref> ([[Eric Allan Kramer]]) is the father of Teddy, PJ, Gabe, Charlie, and Toby, and husband of Amy. He owns a [[pest control]] company, \"Bob's Bugs Be Gone\". He sometimes refers to his business as the \"Triple B-G\". He loves bugs and attends the Bug Convention every year. Bob is the coach of Gabe's basketball team, but he was temporarily replaced by his wife. It is also mentioned in \"Snow Show: Part 1\" that Bob and Amy are not legally married because they were scammed by a [[Confidence trick|con man]] who impersonated a judge; they have a legal ceremony with all 4 children present. His childhood dream was to be a professional wrestler named \"Bobzilla\", which he showed in his company's commercial. Bob gets made fun of a lot throughout the series because of his weight and baldness, usually by Gabe. He is barely more intelligent than the bugs he kills, and breeds much resentment among his kids by being very \"cheap\" and \"tight\" with his money. He wants his family to know him as a \"fix-it\" man, though his projects never seem to work out. He is slightly afraid of Amy, but he calls it a \"strong respect\". He has two positions of authority when it comes to the children: driving lessons and barbecuing. He can be lazy but is determined to spend quality time with his wife and children. He has issues with his mother-in-law, Petunia. It is revealed he has apologized to Amy at least 162 times, while Amy just soaks it up. In \"Baby Steps,\" it is revealed that he dropped all of his kids including Toby. In multiple episodes Bob brags about having his own band in high school, \"The Bob Duncan Experience\", which made a grand total of one record (an LP, no copies). He can still play bass guitar and occasionally sits in with PJ & The Vibe. Late in the third season, Bob began exercising and dropped a massive amount of fat, replacing most of it with muscle. After Amy and the kids staged an intervention to stop his more-revealing wardrobe choices, he admits the catalyst for his getting back in shape was someone in the park mistaking him for Toby's grandfather. It is revealed in \"Amy Needs a Shower\" that his middle name is William. In the final episode, PJ's culinary talents motivates Bob to pry open his wallet and invest in his son's business.\n; {{visible anchor|PJ Duncan}} :<!-- DO NOT put \"Patrick John\" here - That is NOT his real name.

He and Teddy often fight, although they care about each other, and he usually gets along well with his younger brother Gabe. He often appears awkward, somewhat careless, and childish, but on numerous occasions has been known to be resourceful, creative, and intelligent. He has also been shown to be a good cook, and Bob once tricked Amy (who isn't a very good cook) into working later so that PJ would cook. He and his best friend Emmett have their own band entitled \"PJ and the Vibe\". PJ occasionally uses his younger sister Charlie for his personal gain, like when he uses her to make big tips while working for Kwikki Chikki by saying that his mother was in the hospital when she actually worked there (customers just assumed she was ill). He dated Teddy's friend Skyler, who has his type of scatterbrain, but they broke up in \"PJ in the City\", when Skyler had to move to [[New York City]] because of her father's new job. He was originally intended to be named after his great-grandfather, Patrick John, but Bob was nervous as he was writing on his birth certificate, resulting in the legal name of \"Potty John\" instead of the intended \"Patty John\". Despite Bob trying to correct this in the season two episode \"[[List of Good Luck Charlie episodes#ep53|Can You Keep a Secret?]]\", he accidentally changed the intended name to \"PP Duncan\".<ref name=PJ /> It is revealed in the \"Special Delivery\" episode that his middle name is Darth. In season three, PJ moves into an apartment shared with Emmett, but is still in the Duncan house a lot.

For example, in one scene in the pilot episode Amy confesses to Bob that she is overwhelmed with becoming a working new mother again. \"She's not sure she can pull this off\", says Bonnet. \"And just playing that scene the way we did, a very real scene between husband and wife, kind of makes this show different\".<ref name=\"latimes\" /> The writers also try to include jokes for adult viewers while remaining chaste enough for their young target audience.<ref name=\"latimes\" /> Unlike most previous Disney Channel series such as ''[[Sonny with a Chance]]'', ''[[Hannah Montana]]'', or ''[[Cory in the House]]'', both parents are seen in the Duncan family. \"It felt like the right time to have a show with two parents, to debunk the myth that Disney never has the mom in the picture\", says Adam Bonnett, Senior Vice President of original programming for Disney Channel. \"Because it is a myth\".<ref name=\"fellinlove\" />\n\nBecause a series about the rich and famous might alienate viewers in a [[Great Recession|troubled economy]], the Duncans were made [[American middle class|middle class]]. According to [[Gary Marsh]], Entertainment President of Disney Channel Worldwide, \"What we want to do is acknowledge the reality of the times in which we live, where two parents work, where kids are expected to help out around the house in meaningful ways.

The series' creators, [[Phil Baker and Drew Vaupen]], wanted to create a program that would appeal to entire families, not just children. It focuses on the Duncan family of [[Denver]] as they adjust to the births of their fourth and fifth children, Charlotte \"Charlie\" ([[#Mia Talerico|Mia Talerico]]) and Toby (Logan Moreau). In each episode, Teddy Duncan ([[Bridgit Mendler]]) adds to a video diary that contains advice for Charlie about their family and life as a teenager. Teddy tries to show Charlie what she might go through when she is older for future reference. Each video diary ends with Teddy (or another family member, even Charlie) saying the eponymous phrase, \"''Good luck, Charlie''\".\n\nAmong other decisions, executives included adult-centric scenes and changed the series title from ''Oops'' to ''Love, Teddy'' and finally to ''Good Luck Charlie'' in order to ensure the series would appeal to all family members.

Feeling that she will not be around as much when Charlie is grown, she produces and directs video diaries for her, hoping they will give her advice that will help her be successful as a teenager. She produces these video diaries at the end of every episode, and at the end of every video diary she says \"Good luck Charlie\". Her best friend is Ivy Wentz. It was mentioned in \"Sun Show: Part 1\", that her parents were expecting a boy, hence the generally masculine name \"Teddy\". She dated Spencer Walsh in season one, but they broke up after she caught him two-timing both her and a pretty, dim-witted brunette named Skyler, breaking her heart. She and Skyler later become friends. She and Spencer get back together in season two. Throughout the show Teddy has had numerous boyfriends. Teddy shows much care towards her brothers, such as saving PJ from falling out of the treehouse window, or offering to help Gabe deal with Jo, who has given him a black eye. Teddy's best friend Ivy often calls her G.G. for \"goody-goody.\" She and Spencer get back together in \"Can You Keep A Secret?\". In \"All Fall Down\" Teddy and Spencer break up because they don't want to be in a long-distance relationship while Spencer attends the Boston Institute for Performing Arts (BIPA). But when Bob's newest employee Beau admits that he likes Teddy, they begin dating. The two break up when he decides to move home. In \"Accepted\", Teddy finds out that she is on the waiting list for Yale after Victor; later she is accepted. Later in the last episode, Spencer and Teddy get back together and kiss, and she shoots the final entry in her video diary before leaving for Yale.

She worked as a hospital nurse and is often portrayed as dutiful, protective and comedic. She loves her family and does everything to care for and protect them. She appears out-of-her-element when she isn't nurturing them, especially Charlie, but as the series progresses, she begins to feel assured that her youngest children are in good hands and trusts that her husband and 3 eldest children can look after Charlie and Toby. She is notoriously conceited and enjoys bragging about her accomplishments, be they admirable, real, or otherwise. Amy used to be on the local news team and was also a poet in her high-school days. A running gag on the show is that she was involved in virtually every extracurricular activity at Southwest Denver Community College but still earned a nursing degree. She lets special opportunities, such as being on TV or singing in front of a group, go to her head. She has a habit of taking any chance of any publicity that may shine on her family to focus onto her, but this never works out well; usually she ends up being cut from the project or tossed out of certain groups. Amy seldom accepts her children's misbehavior. It is revealed in the [[Good Luck Charlie, It's Christmas!|movie]], that she is pregnant again with her fifth child. In the middle of the third season, Amy quit her nursing job to be a stay-at-home mother to Charlie and Toby. In the final episode, Amy is chosen to be the new anchor on \"Good Morning, Denver\", thanks to Charlie calling in during her on-air audition.\n; {{visible anchor|Gabe Duncan}} :Gabriel<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Charlie Did It!|episodelink=List of Good Luck Charlie episodes#ep6|series=Good Luck Charlie|network=[[Disney Channel]]|airdate=May 9, 2010|season=1|number=6|minutes=06:38}}</ref> \"Gabe\" Duncan ([[Bradley Steven Perry]]) is the middle Duncan sibling, being both the younger brother of Teddy and PJ and the older brother of Charlie and Toby. From the beginning Gabe doesn't approve of Charlie's arrival and is the last one of the family to get used to her, but finally he reaches the point of reluctantly assisting in her care and demonstrating some fondness of her. He is a prankster and troublemaker, (a [[teenage rebellion|rebellious teenager]]) often sarcastic and lazy, but can also be dutiful and determined at times. He is front-man when it comes to the Duncans' running rivalry with their neighbor Mrs. Dabney, who is often the target of Gabe's pranks and stunts\u2014which is the only time the family doesn't mind them. Although he doesn't like Mrs. Dabney, he ends up dating a relative of Mrs. Dabney, Lauren. He and Toby are the only brown-haired Duncans; all of the others are blondes. A running gag in the show is that he insults Bob's weight and baldness, Amy's cooking, PJ being a goofball, Teddy being a \"goody-goody,\" and occasionally Charlie. He also likes to harass and tease Mrs. Dabney, whom he finds annoying. He also won the right to name his baby brother Toby; in one episode, he tried to impress a girl by making video diaries for Toby, ending them with \"Good Fortune, Toby!\". It has been revealed that Gabe was a calm and docile baby.\n; {{visible anchor|Charlie Duncan}} :Charlotte \"Charlie\" Duncan ([[#Mia Talerico|Mia Talerico]]) is the title character and the second-youngest Duncan sibling. She is generally portrayed as being happy. It sometimes takes a few tries to get her to do the right thing. Charlie can also be mischievous at times. Many of the Duncan family's adventures revolve around Charlie. Both her older brothers, PJ and Gabe, are often seen using Charlie for their own benefit, although PJ shows that he cares about her deeply. Gabe seems to dislike Charlie the most although, in some episodes, he is seen being quite fond of her. Amy thinks of Charlie as the perfect baby. It was revealed in \"Charlie is 1\", that it was Teddy's idea to nickname her Charlie. Charlie speaks more often in later episodes of seasons two and three. Toby was born on her birthday; she responded to this by \"I like this present.\" In season three, her personality begins to develop, as she is seen as sneaky and mischievous, such as pretending to like a doll Amy bought for her to like Toby, then throwing it away when she was not looking; and also telling Amy's \"friends\" what she really thinks of them, causing her to lose them all. Also, she can be seen as not liking Toby as in the episode \"Doppel Date\" when she asks Bob if Toby is going to stay at the hotel and he says no and Charlie asks if they can talk about it.\n; {{visible anchor|Bob Duncan}} :Bob William Duncan<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Amy Needs a Shower|episodelink=List of Good Luck Charlie episodes#ep59|series=Good Luck Charlie|network=[[Disney Channel]]|airdate=May 13, 2012|season=3|number=3|minutes=15:30}}</ref> ([[Eric Allan Kramer]]) is the father of Teddy, PJ, Gabe, Charlie, and Toby, and husband of Amy. He owns a [[pest control]] company, \"Bob's Bugs Be Gone\". He sometimes refers to his business as the \"Triple B-G\". He loves bugs and attends the Bug Convention every year. Bob is the coach of Gabe's basketball team, but he was temporarily replaced by his wife. It is also mentioned in \"Snow Show: Part 1\" that Bob and Amy are not legally married because they were scammed by a [[Confidence trick|con man]] who impersonated a judge; they have a legal ceremony with all 4 children present. His childhood dream was to be a professional wrestler named \"Bobzilla\", which he showed in his company's commercial. Bob gets made fun of a lot throughout the series because of his weight and baldness, usually by Gabe. He is barely more intelligent than the bugs he kills, and breeds much resentment among his kids by being very \"cheap\" and \"tight\" with his money. He wants his family to know him as a \"fix-it\" man, though his projects never seem to work out. He is slightly afraid of Amy, but he calls it a \"strong respect\". He has two positions of authority when it comes to the children: driving lessons and barbecuing. He can be lazy but is determined to spend quality time with his wife and children. He has issues with his mother-in-law, Petunia. It is revealed he has apologized to Amy at least 162 times, while Amy just soaks it up. In \"Baby Steps,\" it is revealed that he dropped all of his kids including Toby. In multiple episodes Bob brags about having his own band in high school, \"The Bob Duncan Experience\", which made a grand total of one record (an LP, no copies). He can still play bass guitar and occasionally sits in with PJ & The Vibe. Late in the third season, Bob began exercising and dropped a massive amount of fat, replacing most of it with muscle. After Amy and the kids staged an intervention to stop his more-revealing wardrobe choices, he admits the catalyst for his getting back in shape was someone in the park mistaking him for Toby's grandfather. It is revealed in \"Amy Needs a Shower\" that his middle name is William. In the final episode, PJ's culinary talents motivates Bob to pry open his wallet and invest in his son's business.\n; {{visible anchor|PJ Duncan}} :<!-- DO NOT put \"Patrick John\" here - That is NOT his real name.

He and Teddy often fight, although they care about each other, and he usually gets along well with his younger brother Gabe. He often appears awkward, somewhat careless, and childish, but on numerous occasions has been known to be resourceful, creative, and intelligent. He has also been shown to be a good cook, and Bob once tricked Amy (who isn't a very good cook) into working later so that PJ would cook. He and his best friend Emmett have their own band entitled \"PJ and the Vibe\". PJ occasionally uses his younger sister Charlie for his personal gain, like when he uses her to make big tips while working for Kwikki Chikki by saying that his mother was in the hospital when she actually worked there (customers just assumed she was ill). He dated Teddy's friend Skyler, who has his type of scatterbrain, but they broke up in \"PJ in the City\", when Skyler had to move to [[New York City]] because of her father's new job. He was originally intended to be named after his great-grandfather, Patrick John, but Bob was nervous as he was writing on his birth certificate, resulting in the legal name of \"Potty John\" instead of the intended \"Patty John\". Despite Bob trying to correct this in the season two episode \"[[List of Good Luck Charlie episodes#ep53|Can You Keep a Secret?]]\", he accidentally changed the intended name to \"PP Duncan\".<ref name=PJ /> It is revealed in the \"Special Delivery\" episode that his middle name is Darth.

Inspired by the success of reruns of shows such as ''[[Full House]]'' and ''[[George Lopez (TV series)|George Lopez]]'' with young audiences, Vaupen and Baker turned to [[sitcom|family sitcoms]]. \"We wanted to do a show about a family, to bring back a family sitcom and make it about a real family, not wizards, nobody's a pop star, nobody has a TV show\", said Vaupen,<ref name=\"pitts\" /> referring to ''[[Wizards of Waverly Place]]'', ''[[Hannah Montana]]'', and ''[[Sonny with a Chance]]''.\n\nVeteran writer-producer [[Dan Staley]] (''[[Cheers]]'') later joined the show as executive producer.

While the series is still told primarily through the view point of the Duncan children, the children's parents, Amy and Bob, are less on the periphery and writers attempt to add scenes that adult viewers can relate to. For example, in one scene in the pilot episode Amy confesses to Bob that she is overwhelmed with becoming a working new mother again. \"She's not sure she can pull this off\", says Bonnet. \"And just playing that scene the way we did, a very real scene between husband and wife, kind of makes this show different\".<ref name=\"latimes\" /> The writers also try to include jokes for adult viewers while remaining chaste enough for their young target audience.<ref name=\"latimes\" /> Unlike most previous Disney Channel series such as ''[[Sonny with a Chance]]'', ''[[Hannah Montana]]'', or ''[[Cory in the House]]'', both parents are seen in the Duncan family. \"It felt like the right time to have a show with two parents, to debunk the myth that Disney never has the mom in the picture\", says Adam Bonnett, Senior Vice President of original programming for Disney Channel. \"Because it is a myth\".<ref name=\"fellinlove\" />\n\nBecause a series about the rich and famous might alienate viewers in a [[Great Recession|troubled economy]], the Duncans were made [[American middle class|middle class]].

The chapel was designed in 1914, with the building completed in 1916 and was fully furnished by 1917. The church's architecture and interior fittings are representative of the [[Celtic revival]] movement which sought to echo the [[Insular art|aesthetic style]] that flourished in Ireland and Britain between the 7th and 12th centuries.{{sfn|Sheehy|1980|pp=163, 164}}\n\nIt's construction was initiated and closely supervised by [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]], a proponent of the Celtic revival and [[Arts and Crafts]] movements. He was funded by Isabella Honan (1861-1913), the last member of a wealthy Cork family, who provided large donations towards the build of the chapel. O'Connell oversaw both the architecture design and the commissioning of its exterior carvings and statuettes, its floor, furniture and liturgical collection. He closely instructed the work of the architect James F. McMullen, the builders [[Sisk Group|John Sisk and Sons]], and hired the craftsmen and artists involved in the construction, many of whom incorporated elements of the [[Art Nouveau]] style into the design of the chapel.\n\nThe Honan is internationally known{{sfn|Teehan|2016|p=80}} for its interior which is designed and fitted in a traditionally Irish style, but with an appreciation of current trends in international art.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=3}} Its furnishings include the mosaic flooring, altar plates, metal work and enamels, liturgical textiles and sanctuary furnishings, and especially its nineteen [[stained glass]] windows. Eleven were designed and installed by [[Harry Clarke]], a major Irish artist who completed the works aged twenty seven. His windows were described by the art historian Nicola Gordon Bowe as \"arguably his greatest work in stained glass\".{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} A further eight were designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine O'Brien]] and [[Ethel Rhind]] of \"[[An T\u00far Gloine]]\" (''The Glass Tower'') cooperative studio, founded by [[Sarah Purser]] in 1903.\n\n==Commission==\nPopulation growth and migration in the early 20th century led to the development of a number of suburbs around [[Cork (city)|Cork city]]. This necessitated the building of churches to serve the people living in the new urban areas, and the Honan was the first church built in Cork in the new century. The reasons for its development were very different to those for other contemporary churches, resulting from a longstanding educational disagreement between the [[Protestant]] and Catholic hierarchies. Queens College Cork (today known as [[University College Cork]] (UCC)), was incorporated in 1845 as part of a series of new universities known as the Queen's Colleges,{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} under a charter that excluded Catholic students.{{sfn|Baker|1999|p=165}}\n\n[[File:Honan Hostel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|The Honan Hostel]]\nThis ended in 1911 when the Queen's Colleges folded as legal entities, and as a result students of both denominations were allowed to attend. The Irish Universities Act of 1908 stipulated that government funding could not be allocated towards \"any church, chapel, or other place of religious worship or observance\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1908/act/38/enacted/en/print.html | title = Irish Universities Act, 1908 | publisher = Government of Ireland | website = irishstatutebook.ie | accessdate = 1 September 2019}}</ref> The 1908 legislation meant that any centre for Catholic students in an Irish university could only be attained through private funding.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} Such terms were seen by some as restrictive on Catholic students, including Sir [[Bertram Windle]],{{sfn|Leland|2004}} the university's president, and [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]] (1868-1943), who described the act as \"absurd and scandalous\".{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}}<ref name=\"wg\" />\n\n===Isabella Honan===\nIsabella Honan (n\u00e9e Cunningham, 1861-1913) was the sister-in-law of Robert Honan, the last male heir of a wealthy Catholic family who had made their money in the 19th century as butter merchants.{{sfn|O'Connell|1916|p=11}}{{sfn|Ryan|2016|p=3}} Robert and his brother Matthew were dead by 1909{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}, with Robert having left his fortune to Isabella, who  died in August 1913.

He sought not just to contravene to the 1908 act, but to construct a chapel that was \"something more than merely sufficient...a church designed and fashioned on the same lines and on the same plan as those which their forefathers had built for their priests and missioners all over Ireland nearly a thousand years ago.\"{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}} O'Connell, who became a priest in 1929 after the death of his wife, disliked the contemporary, international, approach to church building, which he described as \"machine made\", preferring a localised and uniquely Irish approach to style and form, which he sought from the most skilled available local craftsmen.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}} He aspired that work on the chapel was \"carried out in Cork, by Cork labour and with materials obtained from the City or County of Cork\".{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}}\n\nO'Connell was assisted by Windle, who was then University president.

The capitals were sculpted by Henry Emery, assisted by students at the nearby [[Cork School of Art]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=40}}\n\nThe [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] was designed by the sculptor [[Oliver Sheppard]], and is dominated by the figure of St. Finbarr, dressed in bishop's [[vestment]]s.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=292}}\n\nThe timber doorway once contained an iron grille which has since been removed. The doors hang on wrought iron strap-work hinges fashioned, according to writer Paul Larmour, in a \"Celticized art nouveau\" style{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=40}} and were designed by the architect [[William Alphonsus Scott|William Scott]]. The doorway leads into a small oblong nave (72 x 28 feet), within a timber barrel vaulted ceiling, that ends at a square ended area around the [[chancel]] (26 x 18 feet). The [[sacristy]] is located on the left (north) side looking towards the altar, and is positioned under the bell tower.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=291}}\n\n==Chancel==\n===Altar===\n[[File:Honan Chapel Altar.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Wooden carvings, altar, Imogen Stuart, c. 1986]]\nThe chapel has had two altars; the first having been replaced in the mid 1980s. The original altar consists of a plain slab of Irish [[limestone]], which O'Connell selected to contrast with the ornately carved Italian [[marble]] then in fashion, and which he disliked.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}} The altar rested on a five legged table, each of which was lined with an [[Celtic cross|Irish crucifix]]{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-295}} formed from simple geometric designs. They included zig-zag patterns in [[lozenge]] and saltire, continuous dots and [[Chevron (geology)|chevron]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=55, 56}}\n\nThe chapel's design contravened the requirements of the 1962 [[Second Vatican Council]] (Vatican II) in two aspects. Firstly, as it was based on medieval churches and the old rites, it was built with a large spacial divide between the nave and chancel, in addition the altar was positioned at the very back of the chancel, with the priest facing away from the congregation.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=196}} In 1986, the German-Irish sculptor [[Imogen Stuart]] was hired by the firm of Richard Hurley & Associates Architects, tasked with the overall redevelopment of the chapel, to redesign the altar, [[pulpit]], priest's chair and baptismal font.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}} Stuart's design brought clergy and attendants closer together by the use of a movable altar.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=196}} Although first intended for the center of the chancel, on the focal point of the mosaic, but this proved to be too far back and impracticable during ceremonies.<ref name=\"rha\">\"[http://www.rha.ie/honan.html Portfolio: Honan Chapel, University College Cork]\".

Made from carved stone, its design is reminiscent of the arched roofs and entrances to medieval Irish churches.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}} Its two panels illustrate Christian themes,{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=85}} The upper, triangular, panel is set in the [[gable]] of the \"entrance\", and shows the Trinity of God the father, a dove and Jesus crucified. Around them, two angles carry the sun, moon, and other symbols of creation. The lower rectangular panel, representing the doorway, shows the Adoration of the Lamb, with the lamb standing on brightly coloured altar decorated with three ringed crosses. Two angels acting as servers kneel before him. The adoration panel is set against a background of branches and leaves attached in [[silver-gilt]].{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=86}}\n\nThe lower panel also shows the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove, surrounded by what Teehan describes as \"the deep blue void of Heaven\".{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=86}} Here he is accompanied by flights of angels, bearing instruments of the passion.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}} The enamel embellishments were added by the Irish craftsman and stained glass specialist Oswald Reeves,{{sfn|Larmour|1992|p=186}} and have been described as the best of his work.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=86}}\n\n===Pipe organ===\nThe pipe organ is located on the west wall in a timber frame.{{sfn|NIAH|2000}} It was built by [[Wicklow]] native Kenneth Jones and installed in 1996.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}{{sfn|McClatchie|2006|p=14}}\n\n==Stained glass windows==\n{{multiple image\n | align        = left\n | direction    = horizontal\n | header_align = \n | footer_align = \n | image1       = Harry Clarke (photo).jpg\n | width1       = 160\n | caption1     = Harry Clarke\n | image2       = Sarah Purser by John Butler Yeats.png\n | width2       = 138\n | caption2     = Sarah Purser\n}}\n\nThe chapel holds 19 stained glass windows. The nave is lined with six at either side, mostly by Clarke, three in the west gable, and four in the chancel.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} O'Connell deliberately placed Harry Clarke and [[Sarah Purser]]'s [[An T\u00far Gloine]] studio in competition for the window's commission.{{sfn|Kennedy|2015|p=99}} After he was sent Clarke's initial designs for the St. Gobnait window, O'Connell immediately a total of eleven windows, out of a planned nineteen.{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1979|p=99}} Clarke's windows were praised by several commentators when first shown in Dublin, with collector Thomas Bodkin writing that \"nothing like Mr Clark's windows had been seen before in Ireland\" and noting the \"sustained magnificence of colour...intricate drawing...[and] lavish and mysterious [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]].\"{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=163}}\n\nThe Clarke and T\u00far Gloine's windows contain similar subject matter and imagery, but vastly differ in style.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} Clarke's are highly detailed, while An T\u00far Gloine's are deliberately simple. Both studios were asked to depict Gaelic saints from the \"golden age\" of [[Christianity in Ireland]].{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=28}} Each displayed their [[Modello|cartoons]] in Dublin before they were physically realised in Cork. Both shows were highly praised, and lead to some debate among art critics as to which sets were superior. In 1955, the Irish [[Michael J. O'Kelly]] summarised that each of the Honan windows are high quality and worthy of individual consideration. While his notes especially single out the windows designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], O'Kelly believes that preferences come down to matters of personal taste.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-295}}\n\nThe windows in the chancel are: Our Lord (or \"Christ [[Christ in Majesty|in Majesty]]\") (Child), Our Lady [[Our Lady of Sorrows|of Sorrows]] (Clarke), St. John (O'Brien) and St. Joseph (Clarke).{{sfn|HayesRogers|2012|pp=128, 130}} To the right of the chancel looking down are: St. Finnbarr (Clarke), St. Albert (Clarke), St. Declan (Clarke), St. Ailbe (Child), St. Fauchtna (Child) and St. Munchin (O'Brien). To the left are: St. Ita (Clarke), St. Coleman (Child), St. Brendan (Clarke), St. Gobnait (Clarke), St. Flannan (O'Brien) and St. Carthage (Rhind).{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=167}}\n\n===Harry Clarke===\n[[File:Clarke St. Declan (1916).jpg|thumb|upright=1.23|Detail, St. Declan window]]\nIt is unlikely Clarke would have won the Honan commission if not for O'Connell's assistance.{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}} Especially his merging of Catholic and early medieval imagery in such a modern and individualised style was at odds with prevailing trends in Irish church art.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=29}}{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=612}} According to scholar Luke Gibbons, freedom \"from [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] interference...enabled Clarke to exploit [[vernacular]] traditions of local saints...that belonged more to legend and [[folklore]]...and whose popular appeal lay outside the highly centralised power of post-[[Great Famine (Ireland)|famine]] [[Ultramontanism|Ultramontane]] Catholicism.\"{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}} Clarke was in his early 20s at the time, and the windows were his first to be installed in a public space, and established his reputation as a significant international artist.{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1979|p=99}}\n\n[[File:Harry Clarke Honan Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Detail, St. Albert window]]\nClark's windows are all single light, with each containing three registers and nine panels. The designs are deeply and richly coloured, employing a deep, thick and rich [[royal blue]] throughout. They contain simplified, often whimsical forms which are nevertheless highly stylised and evoke, in the words of the writer M. J. O'Kelly, \"the spirit of the [[Ancient Celtic religion|ancient Celt]]\".{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}} The panels blends Catholic [[iconography]] with motifs and events from Celtic mythology{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=19}} in a style that draws heavily from [[Art Nouveau]], in particular the darker, ''[[fin de si\u00e8cle]]'' works of [[Aubrey Beardsley]], [[Gustav Klimt]] and [[Egon Schiele]].{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}} The panels contain a multitude of Celtic designs and motifs, and are filled with figures and incidents from the life of each saint. The most obvious Celtic embellishments are [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary's]] red hair and green [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and Brendan's [[pampooties]].{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}} The light of St. [[Albert of Cashel]], who wears a purple [[chasuble]], crimson [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] and a bishop's [[mitre]], contains several Celtic motifs, including the bronze spirals placed around his hair and beard.{{sfn|Costigan|Cullen|2019|p=57}} His depictions often detail magical feats associated with the saint, which Gibbon describes as \"daring\" inclusions, given such deeds owe more to the subject's \"trickster\" [[Paganism|pagan]] powers\" than \"respectable traits of virtue and holiness.\"{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}}\n\nSome of the windows came close to being destroyed during the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] in Dublin.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=19}} Before the windows were installed in Cork, the cartoons were displayed at his Dublin studio, where they were praised by contemporary art critics.{{efn-ua|Clarke's career in stained glass peaked early; from the mid 1920 he was preoccupied with legacy commissions left over from his father's workshop.

Sarah Purser and Edward Martyn formed and financed the T\u00far Gloine workshop in 1903,{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} which was commercially successful and often competing against Clarke for commissions.{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=311}} She recruited A. E. Child, a teacher at the [[National College of Art and Design|Metropolitan School of Art]] in Dublin, who managed the workshop often employing pupils of his.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=99, 167}} The eight windows are attributed to Child (St. Ailbe, St. Fachtna and St. Coleman), and his former pupils [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine (Kitty) O'Brien]]  (St. John, St. Flannan and St. Munchin) and [[Ethel Rhind]] (St. Carthagh).{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}}\n\nAlthough their designs are similar to Clark's in subject matter, they are very different in style. The windows are minimalist in line and colour, consisting of a dominating but simplicity rendered and naturalistic central figure rendered in pale hues,{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} surrounded by uncomplicated, largely empty opaque sub-panels. The most prominently placed window is Child's \"Our Lord\", positioned above the altar, on the east gable.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} Child depicts the risen Christ in simple forms and subdued colours appropriate to his strong but dignified facial expression.

Sometimes mistakenly attributed to Child, it is very different to Child's \"Our Lord\" window, which is reminiscent of a more traditional style of stained glass design. Although O'Brien has not received the same level of study as other members of the An T\u00far Gloine studio, both Virginia Teehan and Nicola Gordon Bowe have commented on her \"beguiling narrative details\" and \"successful harmonisation of colour with The Clarke windows in the chapel\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=131}}\n\nThe window is divided into three [[Register (art)|registers]], with three pairs of medallions below each panel. The imagery is mostly based on scenes from the life of Christ, based on the [[Gospel of John]], and draws more from close readings of scripture than traditions of iconography. The upper register is based on [[Revelation 1|Revelations 1:1]], and shows a vision of the glorified Christ in Majesty, with the Alpha and Omega symbols and the seven candles. John, who throughout the panels is depicted as beardless young man, is shown at the side with his head bowed. The two medallions below this are based on the Gospel of John, and show, on the left, [[St. Peter]] and John running towards Jesus' tomb (with John outpacing Peter), and on the right, Jesus walking with Peter, with St John following behind.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=130}}\n\nThe crucifixion scene in the central register is more richly coloured that the other panels, and per tradition shows Mary and St. John at the foot of the cross. Less usual, and more usual of Protestant than Catholic iconography,{{efn-ua|O'Brien, who joined An T\u00far Gloine in 1904, came from an [[Anglo-Irish]], and devout [[Church of Ireland]] family. She is credited with three windows in the Honan. See Hayes & Rogers (2012), pp. 130, 131}} is the presence of a serpent with its mouth open, coiled around the cross below Jesus' feet. The serpent probably refers to [[Seed of the woman|Genesis 3:15]], which reads: \"And I will put enmity between thee (the serpent) and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The medallions below the crucifixion reflect two accounts of John's brother [[James the Great|James]], \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The lowest register is again in bright colours and shows the calling of James and John. The images stays with scriptural tradition; they are accompanied by their father, and are the second pair to be called, after St. Peter and [[St. Andrew]], who are already at Jesus' side. [[Eagle of Saint John|The eagle]] at the base of the window is John's usual symbol.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}}\n\n==Artwork, furnishings and liturgical collection==\nO'Connell commissioned the Cork firm of Egan & Sons for the altar plate and vestments. He had a strong view on how the chapel should be presented and was keen that its artwork would draw from Ireland's ancient culture. In this, he was heavily influenced by 19th century [[antiquarian]]'s research into early Christian and early medieval traditions and art, in particular the early medieval metal and stone works, and [[illuminated manuscript]]s at the time being newly discovered. He sought that the Honan would further reflect and promote the earlier period's emergent influence on Irish literature and visual culture.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}}\n\n===Furnishings===\nThe furnishings, including the pews, were designed to blend into the chapel's Celtic Revival style, and, according to Teehan create \"a way that represented the spirit and skill of earlier times , [that] could be nonetheless be fully appreciated by contemporary society. The overall effect is one of simplicity and restfulness.\" Such pieces include the circular iron ventilation ceiling panels and the chair and [[kneeler]] reserved for the president. Most of these wfittings were designed by McMullen, most of the others, including the [[pew]]s, by Sisk & Son. Changes in [[liturgy]] following [[Vatican II]] meant that a number of furnishing be replaced, most of which were physically moved to storerooms of the University.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=232}}\n\n===Metalwork===\nThe chapel has an extensive collection of metalwork and enamel pieces. They were built by Edmond Johnson's, Dublin, and the Cork firm William Egan & sons. All are in the Celtic Revival style. A highlight is the large [[processional cross]], a replication of the 12th century [[Cross of Cong]], which contains a number of inscriptions, including a remembrance for the chapel's benefactors: Mathew, Robert and Isabella Honan, and for John and Mary O'Connell.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}{{sfn|Beecher|1971|p=53}} Other items include a processional crosses, [[chalice]]s, candlesticks, dishes, bells, hinges, and the iron gates at the entrance.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=202-209}}\n\n===Textiles===\nMost of the textile collection was designed by the [[Dun Emer Press|Durn Emer]] guild, Dublin, and includes vestments, [[chasuble]]s, burses, veils, [[stole]]s, [[Maniple (vestment)|maniple]]s, altar cloths, wall hangings and altar fronts. Materials vary from silk embroidery, gold braid, gold thread, linen, [[poplin]] and cotton. The names of seamstresses from the Egan workshop are embroidered in the lining of some of the textile commissions.<ref name=\"ff\" /> In general the textiles are coloured in line with changes in the seasonal of the liturgical year. Most of the designs are centred around the Life of Mary; or the Passion or Crucifixion, with black and white being the predominant colours.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=2010-225}} Outstanding pieces include a Y-shaped, silver threaded [[chasuble]] in black poplin cloth, used as a vestment for funerals, and a violet altar cloth with a frontlet, decorated with Celtic interlacing in shades of purple silk, orange and yellow highlights, and a border of lemon and violet cotton satin, used on to decorate the altar and candlesticks.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=201}}\n\nThe \"Black set\" of Honan textiles includes an altar frontal with a Celtic cross based on a grave stone from [[Tullylease]] Cork, a black [[cope]] and hood containing a crown of thorns design,{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=212}} and a black chasuble designed for funeral masses containing Celtic interlace patterns.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=213}}\n\n==Mosaic floor==\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115659.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|River of Life with fish]]\n[[File:Honan floor Tyger.jpg|thumb|upright==1.0|Pelican and tiger]]\nThe mosaic flooring was designed and installed by a German firm lead by the English resident Ludwig Oppenheimer.

The pattern at the entrance contains a verse from [[Psalm 148]] (\"Praise to the Lord from Creation\").{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=114}}\n\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115632.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Floor mosaic with sea creature]]\nThe floor mosaic comprises of four sections. It begins at the main entrance on the west side with a [[sunburst]] and stars, surrounded by signs of the zodiac. The center of the aisle shows a beast's head, acting as the river mouth{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=107}} from which flows a river with fish swimming towards the chancel. The east side of the nave contains a large coiled sea creature, which appears to be part serpent, part dragon, part whale, {{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} and a number of animals, including stags, deer and sheep, drinking from the river. Around them a series of exotic birds flying within forest trees.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} The section inside the chancel itself show a globe and symbols of creation, including animals, plants and [[solar system|planets]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=111, 112}} Interlaced Celtic and [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphs]] designs around the borders unify the four sections.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|pp=293, 294}}\n\nThe image of the sun and surrounding night stars inside the chapel's entrance signifies both the new day and resurrection, as Jesus rose from the dead at dawn. Reflecting 12th century Christian art, the presence of signs of the zodiac indicate God's dominion over time.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} The beast's head in the aisle contains a series of tripartite motifs representing the [[Trinity]]: spirals, [[trefoil]] knots and interlace containing three [[Saltire|saltire crosses]]. The sea creature on the east end of the nave is mentioned in the verse contained on the floor by the entrance \"dracones et omnes abyssi\" (''Dragons and all the depths'').{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=116}} Alongside it are the words \"cete et omnia quae moventur in aquis\" (''whales and all that move in the water''), words that in medieval [[exegesis]] conjured images of death, and direct reference to [[Jonah]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} \n\nThe colouring of the floor by and inside the chancel is more subdued, and the imagery more restrained. The images show a paradise, that can be interpreted both as the [[garden of Eden]], or the eternal paradise promised at the end of time. The imagery is of the seasons, [[Classical element|elements]], and symbols of the [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=120-121}} \n\nA similar depiction on a 5th century sarcophagus in the [[Lateran Museum]] shows Jonah swimming towards the open jaws of a whale with horned ears, and a long, coiled tail.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}}<ref>Lawrence, Marion. \"Ships, Monsters and Jonah\". ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Volume 66, No. 3, 1962. {{JSTOR|501457}}</ref>The reference serves to emphasize how Jesus overcame death.

The chapel was designed in 1914, with the building completed in 1916 and was fully furnished by 1917. The church's architecture and interior fittings are representative of the [[Celtic revival]] movement which sought to echo the [[Insular art|aesthetic style]] that flourished in Ireland and Britain between the 7th and 12th centuries.{{sfn|Sheehy|1980|pp=163, 164}}\n\nIt's construction was initiated and closely supervised by [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]], a proponent of the Celtic revival and [[Arts and Crafts]] movements. He was funded by Isabella Honan (1861-1913), the last member of a wealthy Cork family, who provided large donations towards the build of the chapel. O'Connell oversaw both the architecture design and the commissioning of its exterior carvings and statuettes, its floor, furniture and liturgical collection. He closely instructed the work of the architect James F. McMullen, the builders [[Sisk Group|John Sisk and Sons]], and hired the craftsmen and artists involved in the construction, many of whom incorporated elements of the [[Art Nouveau]] style into the design of the chapel.\n\nThe Honan is internationally known{{sfn|Teehan|2016|p=80}} for its interior which is designed and fitted in a traditionally Irish style, but with an appreciation of current trends in international art.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=3}} Its furnishings include the mosaic flooring, altar plates, metal work and enamels, liturgical textiles and sanctuary furnishings, and especially its nineteen [[stained glass]] windows. Eleven were designed and installed by [[Harry Clarke]], a major Irish artist who completed the works aged twenty seven. His windows were described by the art historian Nicola Gordon Bowe as \"arguably his greatest work in stained glass\".{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} A further eight were designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine O'Brien]] and [[Ethel Rhind]] of \"[[An T\u00far Gloine]]\" (''The Glass Tower'') cooperative studio, founded by [[Sarah Purser]] in 1903.\n\n==Commission==\nPopulation growth and migration in the early 20th century led to the development of a number of suburbs around [[Cork (city)|Cork city]]. This necessitated the building of churches to serve the people living in the new urban areas, and the Honan was the first church built in Cork in the new century. The reasons for its development were very different to those for other contemporary churches, resulting from a longstanding educational disagreement between the [[Protestant]] and Catholic hierarchies. Queens College Cork (today known as [[University College Cork]] (UCC)), was incorporated in 1845 as part of a series of new universities known as the Queen's Colleges,{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} under a charter that excluded Catholic students.{{sfn|Baker|1999|p=165}}\n\n[[File:Honan Hostel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|The Honan Hostel]]\nThis ended in 1911 when the Queen's Colleges folded as legal entities, and as a result students of both denominations were allowed to attend. The Irish Universities Act of 1908 stipulated that government funding could not be allocated towards \"any church, chapel, or other place of religious worship or observance\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1908/act/38/enacted/en/print.html | title = Irish Universities Act, 1908 | publisher = Government of Ireland | website = irishstatutebook.ie | accessdate = 1 September 2019}}</ref> The 1908 legislation meant that any centre for Catholic students in an Irish university could only be attained through private funding.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} Such terms were seen by some as restrictive on Catholic students, including Sir [[Bertram Windle]],{{sfn|Leland|2004}} the university's president, and [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]] (1868-1943), who described the act as \"absurd and scandalous\".{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}}<ref name=\"wg\" />\n\n===Isabella Honan===\nIsabella Honan (n\u00e9e Cunningham, 1861-1913) was the sister-in-law of Robert Honan, the last male heir of a wealthy Catholic family who had made their money in the 19th century as butter merchants.{{sfn|O'Connell|1916|p=11}}{{sfn|Ryan|2016|p=3}} Robert and his brother Matthew were dead by 1909{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}, with Robert having left his fortune to Isabella, who  died in August 1913.

O'Connell rejected international and industrial production methods, seeking a return a smaller scale, more personalised, craft.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=20}}{{sfn|Leland|2004}} While his main inspiration for the building was early medieval architecture, a number of recently built churches in [[County Cork]] informed his choices, in particular [[Timoleague]]'s parish church and the chapel in [[Gougane Barra]].{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=612}}\n\n[[File:Honan interior 1.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|The nave, looking west towards the main entrance]]\nThe chapel's architectural style is Celtic-Romanesque.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=164}} Its interior has a very simple outlay,{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=291}}  consisting of four areas; the main entrance, nave, chancel and nunnery.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=167}} Unusually the chapel does not contain [[aisle]]s or [[transept]]s, and the six-bay {{sfn|NIAH|2000}} rectangular [[nave]] is rather plain.{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}} Compared to the decorative and sculpted elements of the chapel, the architecture is austere and modest.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} Functionally, the chapel lacks shrines where people could light candles or place flowers near devotional images, making it similar to a Protestant rather than a Catholic church.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=25}} Its round bell-tower (''[[campanile]]'') and circular-plan are inspired by the [[Irish round tower|round towers]] found in Irish [[monastic settlement]]s from the 9th century.{{sfn|NIAH|2000}} \n\nThe main entrance is on the western side, and approached via double-hinged [[wrought iron]] gates.{{sfn|NIAH|2000}} The doorway is capped by three limestone [[Rib vault|ribbed]] [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]],{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=292}} supported by [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] containing [[relief]]s of the heads of six [[Munster]] saints: Finnbarr of Cork, [[Colman mac Duagh|Coleman of Cloyne]]; [[St. Gobnait]] of [[Ballyvourney]]; [[Brendan]] of [[County Kerry|Kerry]], [[Decl\u00e1n of Ardmore]] and [[\u00cdte of Killeedy]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=40}} Each figure was later represented in the stained glass windows.

The doors hang on wrought iron strap-work hinges fashioned, according to writer Paul Larmour, in a \"Celticized art nouveau\" style{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=40}} and were designed by the architect [[William Alphonsus Scott|William Scott]]. The doorway leads into a small oblong nave (72 x 28 feet), within a timber barrel vaulted ceiling, that ends at a square ended area around the [[chancel]] (26 x 18 feet).

The original altar consists of a plain slab of Irish [[limestone]], which O'Connell selected to contrast with the ornately carved Italian [[marble]] then in fashion, and which he disliked.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}} The altar rested on a five legged table, each of which was lined with an [[Celtic cross|Irish crucifix]]{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-295}} formed from simple geometric designs. They included zig-zag patterns in [[lozenge]] and saltire, continuous dots and [[Chevron (geology)|chevron]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=55, 56}}\n\nThe chapel's design contravened the requirements of the 1962 [[Second Vatican Council]] (Vatican II) in two aspects. Firstly, as it was based on medieval churches and the old rites, it was built with a large spacial divide between the nave and chancel, in addition the altar was positioned at the very back of the chancel, with the priest facing away from the congregation.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=196}} In 1986, the German-Irish sculptor [[Imogen Stuart]] was hired by the firm of Richard Hurley & Associates Architects, tasked with the overall redevelopment of the chapel, to redesign the altar, [[pulpit]], priest's chair and baptismal font.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}} Stuart's design brought clergy and attendants closer together by the use of a movable altar.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=196}} Although first intended for the center of the chancel, on the focal point of the mosaic, but this proved to be too far back and impracticable during ceremonies.<ref name=\"rha\">\"[http://www.rha.ie/honan.html Portfolio: Honan Chapel, University College Cork]\".

Around them, two angles carry the sun, moon, and other symbols of creation. The lower rectangular panel, representing the doorway, shows the Adoration of the Lamb, with the lamb standing on brightly coloured altar decorated with three ringed crosses.

The nave is lined with six at either side, mostly by Clarke, three in the west gable, and four in the chancel.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} O'Connell deliberately placed Harry Clarke and [[Sarah Purser]]'s [[An T\u00far Gloine]] studio in competition for the window's commission.{{sfn|Kennedy|2015|p=99}} After he was sent Clarke's initial designs for the St. Gobnait window, O'Connell immediately a total of eleven windows, out of a planned nineteen.{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1979|p=99}} Clarke's windows were praised by several commentators when first shown in Dublin, with collector Thomas Bodkin writing that \"nothing like Mr Clark's windows had been seen before in Ireland\" and noting the \"sustained magnificence of colour...intricate drawing...[and] lavish and mysterious [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]].\"{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=163}}\n\nThe Clarke and T\u00far Gloine's windows contain similar subject matter and imagery, but vastly differ in style.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} Clarke's are highly detailed, while An T\u00far Gloine's are deliberately simple. Both studios were asked to depict Gaelic saints from the \"golden age\" of [[Christianity in Ireland]].{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=28}} Each displayed their [[Modello|cartoons]] in Dublin before they were physically realised in Cork. Both shows were highly praised, and lead to some debate among art critics as to which sets were superior. In 1955, the Irish [[Michael J. O'Kelly]] summarised that each of the Honan windows are high quality and worthy of individual consideration. While his notes especially single out the windows designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], O'Kelly believes that preferences come down to matters of personal taste.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-295}}\n\nThe windows in the chancel are: Our Lord (or \"Christ [[Christ in Majesty|in Majesty]]\") (Child), Our Lady [[Our Lady of Sorrows|of Sorrows]] (Clarke), St. John (O'Brien) and St. Joseph (Clarke).{{sfn|HayesRogers|2012|pp=128, 130}} To the right of the chancel looking down are: St. Finnbarr (Clarke), St. Albert (Clarke), St. Declan (Clarke), St. Ailbe (Child), St. Fauchtna (Child) and St. Munchin (O'Brien). To the left are: St. Ita (Clarke), St. Coleman (Child), St. Brendan (Clarke), St. Gobnait (Clarke), St. Flannan (O'Brien) and St. Carthage (Rhind).{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=167}}\n\n===Harry Clarke===\n[[File:Clarke St. Declan (1916).jpg|thumb|upright=1.23|Detail, St. Declan window]]\nIt is unlikely Clarke would have won the Honan commission if not for O'Connell's assistance.{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}} Especially his merging of Catholic and early medieval imagery in such a modern and individualised style was at odds with prevailing trends in Irish church art.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=29}}{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=612}} According to scholar Luke Gibbons, freedom \"from [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] interference...enabled Clarke to exploit [[vernacular]] traditions of local saints...that belonged more to legend and [[folklore]]...and whose popular appeal lay outside the highly centralised power of post-[[Great Famine (Ireland)|famine]] [[Ultramontanism|Ultramontane]] Catholicism.\"{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}} Clarke was in his early 20s at the time, and the windows were his first to be installed in a public space, and established his reputation as a significant international artist.{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1979|p=99}}\n\n[[File:Harry Clarke Honan Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Detail, St. Albert window]]\nClark's windows are all single light, with each containing three registers and nine panels. The designs are deeply and richly coloured, employing a deep, thick and rich [[royal blue]] throughout. They contain simplified, often whimsical forms which are nevertheless highly stylised and evoke, in the words of the writer M. J. O'Kelly, \"the spirit of the [[Ancient Celtic religion|ancient Celt]]\".{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}} The panels blends Catholic [[iconography]] with motifs and events from Celtic mythology{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=19}} in a style that draws heavily from [[Art Nouveau]], in particular the darker, ''[[fin de si\u00e8cle]]'' works of [[Aubrey Beardsley]], [[Gustav Klimt]] and [[Egon Schiele]].{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}} The panels contain a multitude of Celtic designs and motifs, and are filled with figures and incidents from the life of each saint. The most obvious Celtic embellishments are [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary's]] red hair and green [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and Brendan's [[pampooties]].{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}} The light of St. [[Albert of Cashel]], who wears a purple [[chasuble]], crimson [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] and a bishop's [[mitre]], contains several Celtic motifs, including the bronze spirals placed around his hair and beard.{{sfn|Costigan|Cullen|2019|p=57}} His depictions often detail magical feats associated with the saint, which Gibbon describes as \"daring\" inclusions, given such deeds owe more to the subject's \"trickster\" [[Paganism|pagan]] powers\" than \"respectable traits of virtue and holiness.\"{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}}\n\nSome of the windows came close to being destroyed during the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] in Dublin.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=19}} Before the windows were installed in Cork, the cartoons were displayed at his Dublin studio, where they were praised by contemporary art critics.{{efn-ua|Clarke's career in stained glass peaked early; from the mid 1920 he was preoccupied with legacy commissions left over from his father's workshop.

Sarah Purser and Edward Martyn formed and financed the T\u00far Gloine workshop in 1903,{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} which was commercially successful and often competing against Clarke for commissions.{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=311}} She recruited A. E. Child, a teacher at the [[National College of Art and Design|Metropolitan School of Art]] in Dublin, who managed the workshop often employing pupils of his.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=99, 167}} The eight windows are attributed to Child (St. Ailbe, St. Fachtna and St. Coleman), and his former pupils [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine (Kitty) O'Brien]]  (St. John, St. Flannan and St. Munchin) and [[Ethel Rhind]] (St. Carthagh).{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}}\n\nAlthough their designs are similar to Clark's in subject matter, they are very different in style. The windows are minimalist in line and colour, consisting of a dominating but simplicity rendered and naturalistic central figure rendered in pale hues,{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} surrounded by uncomplicated, largely empty opaque sub-panels. The most prominently placed window is Child's \"Our Lord\", positioned above the altar, on the east gable.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} Child depicts the risen Christ in simple forms and subdued colours appropriate to his strong but dignified facial expression.

Sometimes mistakenly attributed to Child, it is very different to Child's \"Our Lord\" window, which is reminiscent of a more traditional style of stained glass design. Although O'Brien has not received the same level of study as other members of the An T\u00far Gloine studio, both Virginia Teehan and Nicola Gordon Bowe have commented on her \"beguiling narrative details\" and \"successful harmonisation of colour with The Clarke windows in the chapel\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=131}}\n\nThe window is divided into three [[Register (art)|registers]], with three pairs of medallions below each panel. The imagery is mostly based on scenes from the life of Christ, based on the [[Gospel of John]], and draws more from close readings of scripture than traditions of iconography. The upper register is based on [[Revelation 1|Revelations 1:1]], and shows a vision of the glorified Christ in Majesty, with the Alpha and Omega symbols and the seven candles. John, who throughout the panels is depicted as beardless young man, is shown at the side with his head bowed. The two medallions below this are based on the Gospel of John, and show, on the left, [[St. Peter]] and John running towards Jesus' tomb (with John outpacing Peter), and on the right, Jesus walking with Peter, with St John following behind.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=130}}\n\nThe crucifixion scene in the central register is more richly coloured that the other panels, and per tradition shows Mary and St. John at the foot of the cross. Less usual, and more usual of Protestant than Catholic iconography,{{efn-ua|O'Brien, who joined An T\u00far Gloine in 1904, came from an [[Anglo-Irish]], and devout [[Church of Ireland]] family. She is credited with three windows in the Honan. See Hayes & Rogers (2012), pp. 130, 131}} is the presence of a serpent with its mouth open, coiled around the cross below Jesus' feet. The serpent probably refers to [[Seed of the woman|Genesis 3:15]], which reads: \"And I will put enmity between thee (the serpent) and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The medallions below the crucifixion reflect two accounts of John's brother [[James the Great|James]], \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The lowest register is again in bright colours and shows the calling of James and John. The images stays with scriptural tradition; they are accompanied by their father, and are the second pair to be called, after St. Peter and [[St. Andrew]], who are already at Jesus' side. [[Eagle of Saint John|The eagle]] at the base of the window is John's usual symbol.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}}\n\n==Artwork, furnishings and liturgical collection==\nO'Connell commissioned the Cork firm of Egan & Sons for the altar plate and vestments. He had a strong view on how the chapel should be presented and was keen that its artwork would draw from Ireland's ancient culture. In this, he was heavily influenced by 19th century [[antiquarian]]'s research into early Christian and early medieval traditions and art, in particular the early medieval metal and stone works, and [[illuminated manuscript]]s at the time being newly discovered. He sought that the Honan would further reflect and promote the earlier period's emergent influence on Irish literature and visual culture.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}}\n\n===Furnishings===\nThe furnishings, including the pews, were designed to blend into the chapel's Celtic Revival style, and, according to Teehan create \"a way that represented the spirit and skill of earlier times , [that] could be nonetheless be fully appreciated by contemporary society. The overall effect is one of simplicity and restfulness.\" Such pieces include the circular iron ventilation ceiling panels and the chair and [[kneeler]] reserved for the president. Most of these wfittings were designed by McMullen, most of the others, including the [[pew]]s, by Sisk & Son. Changes in [[liturgy]] following [[Vatican II]] meant that a number of furnishing be replaced, most of which were physically moved to storerooms of the University.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=232}}\n\n===Metalwork===\nThe chapel has an extensive collection of metalwork and enamel pieces. They were built by Edmond Johnson's, Dublin, and the Cork firm William Egan & sons. All are in the Celtic Revival style. A highlight is the large [[processional cross]], a replication of the 12th century [[Cross of Cong]], which contains a number of inscriptions, including a remembrance for the chapel's benefactors: Mathew, Robert and Isabella Honan, and for John and Mary O'Connell.{{sfn|Beecher|1971|p=53}}{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}} Other items include a processional crosses, [[chalice]]s, candlesticks, dishes, bells, hinges, and the iron gates at the entrance.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=202-209}}\n\n===Textiles===\nMost of the textile collection was designed by the [[Dun Emer Press|Durn Emer]] guild, Dublin, and includes vestments, [[chasuble]]s, burses, veils, [[stole]]s, [[Maniple (vestment)|maniple]]s, altar cloths, wall hangings and altar fronts. Materials vary from silk embroidery, gold braid, gold thread, linen, [[poplin]] and cotton. The names of seamstresses from the Egan workshop are embroidered in the lining of some of the textile commissions.<ref name=\"ff\" /> In general the textiles are coloured in line with changes in the seasonal of the liturgical year. Most of the designs are centred around the Life of Mary; or the Passion or Crucifixion, with black and white being the predominant colours.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=2010-225}} Outstanding pieces include a Y-shaped, silver threaded [[chasuble]] in black poplin cloth, used as a vestment for funerals, and a violet altar cloth with a frontlet, decorated with Celtic interlacing in shades of purple silk, orange and yellow highlights, and a border of lemon and violet cotton satin, used on to decorate the altar and candlesticks.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=201}}\n\nThe \"Black set\" of Honan textiles includes an altar frontal with a Celtic cross based on a grave stone from [[Tullylease]] Cork, a black [[cope]] and hood containing a crown of thorns design,{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=212}} and a black chasuble designed for funeral masses containing Celtic interlace patterns.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=213}}\n\n==Mosaic floor==\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115659.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|River of Life with fish]]\n[[File:Honan floor Tyger.jpg|thumb|upright==1.0|Pelican and tiger]]\nThe mosaic flooring was designed and installed by a German firm lead by the English resident Ludwig Oppenheimer. It is decorated with symbols the [[zodiac]],{{sfn|McClatchie|2006|p=14}} and images based on the Christian theme of the \"River of Life\",{{sfn|NIAH|2000}}{{sfn|Field|2006}} as well as depictions of flora, fauna and river scenes.<ref name=\"lel\" /> The designs celebrate the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] of the earth, and illustrate passages from the [[Old Testament]], including the \"[[Benedicite]]\" (also known as \"A Song of Creation\") from the [[Book of Daniel]], which was [[Laudate psalms|sung]] during the [[Lauds|office of lauds]] on Sundays and [[Calendar of saints|feast days]]. The pattern at the entrance contains a verse from [[Psalm 148]] (\"Praise to the Lord from Creation\").{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=114}}\n\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115632.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Floor mosaic with sea creature]]\nThe floor mosaic comprises of four sections. It begins at the main entrance on the west side with a [[sunburst]] and stars, surrounded by signs of the zodiac. The center of the aisle shows a beast's head, acting as the river mouth{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=107}} from which flows a river with fish swimming towards the chancel. The east side of the nave contains a large coiled sea creature, which appears to be part serpent, part dragon, part whale, {{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} and a number of animals, including stags, deer and sheep, drinking from the river. Around them a series of exotic birds flying within forest trees.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} The section inside the chancel itself show a globe and symbols of creation, including animals, plants and [[solar system|planets]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=111, 112}} Interlaced Celtic and [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphs]] designs around the borders unify the four sections.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|pp=293, 294}}\n\nThe image of the sun and surrounding night stars inside the chapel's entrance signifies both the new day and resurrection, as Jesus rose from the dead at dawn. Reflecting 12th century Christian art, the presence of signs of the zodiac indicate God's dominion over time.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} The beast's head in the aisle contains a series of tripartite motifs representing the [[Trinity]]: spirals, [[trefoil]] knots and interlace containing three [[Saltire|saltire crosses]]. The sea creature on the east end of the nave is mentioned in the verse contained on the floor by the entrance \"dracones et omnes abyssi\" (''Dragons and all the depths'').{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=116}} Alongside it are the words \"cete et omnia quae moventur in aquis\" (''whales and all that move in the water''), words that in medieval [[exegesis]] conjured images of death, and direct reference to [[Jonah]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} \n\nThe colouring of the floor by and inside the chancel is more subdued, and the imagery more restrained. The images show a paradise, that can be interpreted both as the [[garden of Eden]], or the eternal paradise promised at the end of time. The imagery is of the seasons, [[Classical element|elements]], and symbols of the [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=120-121}} \n\nA similar depiction on a 5th century sarcophagus in the [[Lateran Museum]] shows Jonah swimming towards the open jaws of a whale with horned ears, and a long, coiled tail.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}}<ref>Lawrence, Marion. \"Ships, Monsters and Jonah\". ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Volume 66, No. 3, 1962. {{JSTOR|501457}}</ref>The reference serves to emphasize how Jesus overcame death. This connection is further made by the inclusion of the trees ([[tree of life]]) which in mythology grow in paradise and represent Christ, and the surrounding animals at rest, presented as symbols of his Christian followers.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=118}}\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{notelist-ua|30em}}\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Baker|first= R.

He received primary education in the [[Jelgava|Mitau]] Classic [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]], and in 1910 enrolled Riga Polytechnic Institute. During the First World War, he, among many, went in evacuation to the inner regions of Russian Empire; after returning from it in 1921, he completed his education in the new-founded University of Latvia and worked at the Faculty of Chemistry, raising to the position of the chair of the Department of organic chemistry. He received his [[habilitation]] in 1932.\n\nAfter Riga Polytechnic Institute was reestablished in 1958, G. Vanags moved to it, serving in the same position as the department chair until 1965. Simultaneously he also worked in the State Institute of Organic Synthesis, where he carried out his research in the chemistry of cyclic \u03b2-[[diketones]]. He was founder of Riga scholl of organic chemists specializing on \u03b2-diketones, which continues up to day (2020). Gustavs Vanags, along with his students, designed and synthesized several compounds of notable application in medicine, agriculture and chemical analysis (omefin, bindon,<ref>{{cite web|publisher=PubChem|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Bindone|access-date=3 April 2020|title=Bindone}}</ref> nitroindandione,<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Acta Crystallographica]] B|year=1977|volume=B33|pages=3045-3049|title=The crystal and molecular structure of 2-nitro-1,3-indandione dihydrate.

He received primary education in the [[Jelgava|Mitau]] Classic [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]], and in 1910 enrolled Riga Polytechnic Institute. During the First World War, he, among many, went in evacuation to the inner regions of Russian Empire; after returning from it in 1921, he completed his education in the new-founded University of Latvia and worked at the Faculty of Chemistry, raising to the position of the chair of the Department of organic chemistry. He received his [[habilitation]] in 1932.\n\nAfter Riga Polytechnic Institute was reestablished in 1958, G. Vanags moved to it, serving in the same position as the department chair until 1965. Simultaneously he also worked in the State Institute of Organic Synthesis, where he carried out his research in the chemistry of cyclic \u03b2-[[diketones]]. He was founder of Riga scholl of organic chemists specializing on \u03b2-diketones, which continues up to day (2020). Gustavs Vanags, along with his students, designed and synthesized several compounds of notable application in medicine, agriculture and chemical analysis (omefin, bindon,<ref>{{cite web|publisher=PubChem|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Bindone|access-date=3 April 2020|title=Bindone}}</ref> nitroindandione,<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Acta Crystallographica]] B|year=1977|volume=B33|pages=3045-3049|title=The crystal and molecular structure of 2-nitro-1,3-indandione dihydrate.

Spinosaur remains have generally been attributed to the Early to Mid [[Cretaceous]], with the exception of the ''[[Ostafrikasaurus]]'' from the [[Late Jurassic]].\n\nSpinosaurids were large [[Bipedalism|bipedal]] [[carnivore]]s with elongated, crocodile-like skulls lined with conical teeth bearing little to no [[serration]]s, and small [[Sagittal crest|crests]] on top of their heads. The teeth in the front end of their lower jaws fanned out into a spoon-shaped structure similar to a [[Rosette (design)|rosette]], which gave the animal a characteristic look. Their shoulders were robust, prominent and bore stocky forelimbs with giant \"hooked\" claws on the first finger of their hands. Many genera had unusually tall [[neural spines]] on their [[vertebra]]e, which supported [[Neural spine sail|sails]] or humps of skin or fat tissue.\n\nDirect fossil evidence and anatomical adaptations indicate that spinosaurids were at least partly [[piscivorous]],<ref name=\":3\" /> with additional fossil finds indicating they also hunted [[pterosaur]]s and small to medium-sized dinosaurs.

Examinations in 2017 by Marcos Sales and Cesar Schultz indicate that the South American spinosaurids ''Angaturama'' and ''Irritator'' were intermediate between Baronychinae and Spinosaurinae based on their craniodental features and cladistic analysis.

Rayfield and colleagues, in 2007, conducted biomechanical studies on the skull of ''Baryonyx'', which had a long, laterally compressed skull, comparing it to [[gharial]] (long, narrow, tubular) and [[alligator]] (flat and wide) skulls. They found that the structure of baryonychine jaws converged on that of gharials, in that the two taxa showed similar response patterns to stress from simulated feeding loads, and did so with and without the presence of a (simulated) secondary palate. The gharial, exemplar of a long, narrow, and tubular snout, is a fish specialist. However, this snout anatomy does not preclude other options for the spinosaurids. The gharial is the most extreme example and a fish specialist; [[Australian Freshwater Crocodile|Australian freshwater crocodiles]] (''Crocodylus johnstoni''), which have similarly shaped skulls to gharials, also specialize more on fish than sympatric, broad snouted crocodiles and are opportunistic feeders which eat all manner of small aquatic prey, including insects and [[crustacean]]s. Thus, spinosaurids' snouts correlate with piscivory; this is consistent with hypotheses of this diet for spinosaurids, in particular baryonychines, but it does not indicate that they were solely piscivorous.<ref name=\"rayfieldetal2007\">Rayfield, Emily J., Angela C.

''Baryonyx'' had, in models where the size difference of the skulls was corrected for, greater resistance to torsion and dorsoventral bending than both ''Spinosaurus'' and the gharial, while both spinosaurids were inferior to the gharial, alligator, and [[slender-snouted crocodile]] in resisting torsion and medio-lateral bending. When the results from the modeling were not scaled according to size, then both spinosaurids performed better than all the crocodilians in resistance to bending and torsion, due to their larger size. Thus, Cuff and Rayfield suggest that the skulls are not efficiently built to deal well with relatively large, struggling prey, but that spinosaurids may overcome prey simply by their size advantage, and not skull build.<ref name=\"CuffandRayfield2013\">Cuff, Andrew R., and Emily J.

Isotope ratios from teeth from ''Baryonyx'', ''Irritator'', ''Siamosaurus'', and ''Spinosaurus'' were compared with isotopic compositions from contemporaneous theropods, turtles, and crocodilians. The study found that, among theropods, spinosaurid isotope ratios were closer to those of turtles and crocodilians. ''Siamosaurus'' specimens tended to have the largest difference from the ratios of other theropods, and ''Spinosaurus'' tended to have the least difference. The authors concluded that spinosaurids, like modern crocodilians and hippopotamuses, spent much of their daily lives in water. The authors also suggested that semiaquatic habits and piscivory in spinosaurids can explain how spinosaurids coexisted with other large theropods: by feeding on different prey items and living in different habitats, the different types of  theropods would have been out of direct competition.<ref name=\"RMetal10\" />\n\nIn 2018, an analysis was conducted on the partial [[tibia]] of an indeterminate spinosaurine from the early [[Albian]], the bone was from a sub-adult between 7\u201313 m (22\u201342&nbsp;ft) in length still growing moderately fast before its death.

Spinosaur remains have generally been attributed to the Early to Mid [[Cretaceous]], with the exception of the ''[[Ostafrikasaurus]]'' from the [[Late Jurassic]].\n\nSpinosaurids were large [[Bipedalism|bipedal]] [[carnivore]]s with elongated, crocodile-like skulls lined with conical teeth bearing little to no [[serration]]s, and small [[Sagittal crest|crests]] on top of their heads. The teeth in the front end of their lower jaws fanned out into a spoon-shaped structure similar to a [[Rosette (design)|rosette]], which gave the animal a characteristic look. Their shoulders were robust, prominent and bore stocky forelimbs with giant \"hooked\" claws on the first finger of their hands. Many genera had unusually tall [[neural spines]] on their [[vertebra]]e, which supported [[Neural spine sail|sails]] or humps of skin or fat tissue.\n\nDirect fossil evidence and anatomical adaptations indicate that spinosaurids were at least partly [[piscivorous]],<ref name=\":3\" /> with additional fossil finds indicating they also hunted [[pterosaur]]s and small to medium-sized dinosaurs. [[Osteological]] analyses have suggested a [[List of semiaquatic tetrapods|semiaquatic]] lifestyle for some members of this clade.\n\n==Description==\n\n=== Body size ===\n[[File:Spinosauridae_Size_Diagram_by_PaleoGeek_-_Version_2.svg|thumb|left|Size comparison of various spinosaurids with a human]]\n\nAlthough reliable size and weight estimates for most taxa are hindered by the lack of good material, all known spinosaurids were large animals.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=HONE|first=David William Elliott|last2=HOLTZ|first2=Thomas Richard|date=2017|title=A Century of Spinosaurs - A Review and Revision of the Spinosauridae with Comments on Their Ecology|journal=Acta Geologica Sinica - English Edition|language=en|volume=91|issue=3|pages=1120\u20131132|doi=10.1111/1755-6724.13328|issn=1000-9515|url=http://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/49404}}</ref> The smallest, ''[[Irritator]]'', was between 6 and 8 meters in length and 1 tonne (1.1 short tons) in weight.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/ultimateguidetod0000dixo|url-access=registration|title=The Ultimate Guide to Dinosaurs|last=Dixon|first=Dougal|date=2009|publisher=Ticktock Books|isbn=9781846969881|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"Holtz20082\">Holtz, Thomas R.

Their subfamily was defined by Holtz and colleagues in 2004, as the complementary clade of all taxa closer to ''Baryonyx walkeri'' than to ''Spinosaurus aegyptiacus''. Examinations in 2017 by Marcos Sales and Cesar Schultz indicate that the South American spinosaurids ''Angaturama'' and ''Irritator'' were intermediate between Baronychinae and Spinosaurinae based on their craniodental features and cladistic analysis.

Rayfield and colleagues, in 2007, conducted biomechanical studies on the skull of ''Baryonyx'', which had a long, laterally compressed skull, comparing it to [[gharial]] (long, narrow, tubular) and [[alligator]] (flat and wide) skulls. They found that the structure of baryonychine jaws converged on that of gharials, in that the two taxa showed similar response patterns to stress from simulated feeding loads, and did so with and without the presence of a (simulated) secondary palate. The gharial, exemplar of a long, narrow, and tubular snout, is a fish specialist. However, this snout anatomy does not preclude other options for the spinosaurids. The gharial is the most extreme example and a fish specialist; [[Australian Freshwater Crocodile|Australian freshwater crocodiles]] (''Crocodylus johnstoni''), which have similarly shaped skulls to gharials, also specialize more on fish than sympatric, broad snouted crocodiles and are opportunistic feeders which eat all manner of small aquatic prey, including insects and [[crustacean]]s. Thus, spinosaurids' snouts correlate with piscivory; this is consistent with hypotheses of this diet for spinosaurids, in particular baryonychines, but it does not indicate that they were solely piscivorous.<ref name=\"rayfieldetal2007\">Rayfield, Emily J., Angela C.

''Baryonyx'' had, in models where the size difference of the skulls was corrected for, greater resistance to torsion and dorsoventral bending than both ''Spinosaurus'' and the gharial, while both spinosaurids were inferior to the gharial, alligator, and [[slender-snouted crocodile]] in resisting torsion and medio-lateral bending. When the results from the modeling were not scaled according to size, then both spinosaurids performed better than all the crocodilians in resistance to bending and torsion, due to their larger size.

He held the world [[heavyweight]] title from 1926 to 1928, and the American [[light heavyweight]] title twice between 1922 and 1923. A highly technical boxer, Tunney had a five-fight light heavyweight rivalry with [[Harry Greb]] in which he won three, drew once, and lost once. He also knocked out [[Georges Carpentier]] and defeated [[Jack Dempsey]] twice; first in 1926 and again in 1927. Tunney's successful title defense against Dempsey remains one of the most famous bouts in boxing history and is known as [[The Long Count Fight]]. He retired undefeated as a heavyweight after his victory over [[Tom Heeney]] in 1928, after which Tunney was named [[Ring magazine Fighter of the Year|Fighter of the Year]] by [[The Ring (magazine)|''The Ring'' magazine]].\n\n==Early life==\nMary Lydon from Culleen House, Gorthgarve, [[Kiltimagh]], [[County Mayo]], Ireland, emigrated to the United States after the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]]. She settled in [[New York City]], where she met John Tunney, also from Cill Aodain, Kiltimagh. They married after a short courtship. The Tunneys had seven children; one son was murdered around 1920, another was a New York Police Department detective from 1924 to 1951, dying in 1971, while Gene would become famous as a World Heavyweight Boxing Champion.\nAt an early age, Tunney was inspired by President Theodore Roosevelt to become physically fit.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Edmund |title=The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt |date=2001 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=9781400069651 |page=xvii}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Gene Tunney in Marine uniform.jpg|left|thumb|Tunney in Marine uniform]]\nTunney fought some 68 official professional fights, losing only one, to [[Harry Greb]], while fighting as a [[light heavyweight]].  Tunney fought many other fights whose scoring was unofficial, judged by newspaper reporters. He also lost none of these \"[[newspaper decision]]s.\"  He reported that he lost a second fight during World War I, a 10-round decision, to [[Tommy Loughran]], as a Marine before he began his professional boxing career. Tunney was regarded as an extremely skillful boxer who excelled in defense. In addition to beating Dempsey, the most famous fighter of his era, Tunney defeated [[Tommy Gibbons]], [[Georges Carpentier]] and many other fine boxers.\n\nAlready the U.S. Expeditionary Forces champion, Tunney spent the winter of 1921 as a [[lumberjack]] in northern [[Ontario]] for the J. R. Booth Company of [[Ottawa]], without revealing he was a champion boxer. He explained this as \"wanting the solitude and the strenuous labors of the woods to help condition himself for the career that appeared before him.\"<ref>{{Cite news |work=The Globe |date=September 28, 1926 |title=Tunney was Lumberjack for Ottawa Company |page=9}}</ref>\n\nTunney also had a brief [[acting]] career, starring in the movie ''[[The Fighting Marine]]'' in 1926. Unfortunately, no prints of this film are known to exist.\n\nHe was elected as [[Ring Magazine]]'s first-ever [[Ring Magazine fighters of the year|Fighter of the Year]] in 1928 and later elected to the [[World Boxing Hall of Fame]] in 1980, the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] in 1990 and the United States Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame in 2001.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1928, Tunney married a wealthy [[socialite]], the former [[Polly Lauder Tunney|Mary \"Polly\" Lauder]] (April 24, 1907 \u2013 April 19, 2008). Mrs. Tunney was born into the [[Lauder Greenway Family]]; her grandfather was billionaire [[George Lauder (Scottish industrialist)|George Lauder]], a first [[cousin]] and business partner of [[industrialist]] and [[philanthropist]] [[Andrew Carnegie]]. According to a 2007 [[biography]], Tunney promised Polly that he would quit boxing and defended his title only one more time after the second Dempsey fight, against [[Tom Heeney]] of New Zealand.\n\nAfter Mr. Tunney's retirement, the couple lived in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] and raised four children.<ref>https://www.leagle.com/decision/1981154242mhtcm150011197</ref> They had three boys including [[John V.

Tunney's style was influenced by other noted boxing thinkers such as [[James J. Corbett]] and [[Benny Leonard]]. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to think of Tunney as a stick-and-move fighter in the Ali style. While Tunney's heavyweight fights against Gibbons, Carpentier, and Dempsey featured his fleet-footed movement and rapid-fire jabbing, his earlier bouts, especially the five against Harry Greb, demonstrated his vicious body punching and willingness to fight toe-to-toe. It was Benny Leonard who advised Tunney that the only way to beat Harry \"The Human Windmill\" Greb was to aim his punches at Greb's body rather than his head.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nAlways moving and boxing behind an excellent left jab, Tunney would study his opponents from the first bell. He generally preferred to stay outside and nullify any attacks, while using quick counters to keep the opponent off balance. In his fights against Jack Dempsey, today's viewer can see Tunney's style: hands held low for greater power, fast footwork that adjusts to every move his opponent makes and quick and accurate one-two style counter-punches with the left and right.\n\nTunney was never knocked out, while only ever being knocked down once, that in his second fight with Dempsey in the infamous [[The Long Count Fight|Long Count]]. This makes him one of only five Heavyweight champions, alongside [[Rocky Marciano]], [[Riddick Bowe]], [[Sultan Ibragimov]] and [[Nicolai Valuev]] to retire without ever suffering a stoppage defeat. Tunney, along with Marciano, Lewis and [[Vitali Klitschko]] is one of four heavyweight champions to have retired as champion and to have ended their career with a win in a world title fight. Having avenged his only defeat to [[Harry Greb]], with whom he also drew), Tunney joins [[Ingemar Johansson]], [[Rocky Marciano]], [[Lennox Lewis]] and [[Riddick Bowe]] as the only five heavyweight champions to have retired while holding a victory over every opponent he faced as a professional (barring no-contests).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Publications==\nIn 1932, Tunney published a book called ''A Man Must Fight'', in which he gave comments on his career and boxing techniques.\n\n==The Tunney Cup==\nIn 1928, the U.S. Marine Corps presented \u2013 as a sign of friendship \u2013 a challenge cup to the Corps of Royal Marines, in the hope it might be competed for by [[Royal Marines Football Association#Tunney Cup|Royal Marines association football]] teams.<ref name=RMhistory>{{cite web |title=A Brief History of the Royal Marines Football Association |first=Shaun |last=Foster |publisher=Royal Marines Football Association |url=http://www.royalmarinesfootball.co.uk/rm-football-history.html |accessdate=2017-03-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223171718/http://www.royalmarinesfootball.co.uk/rm-football-history.html |archive-date=2016-02-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=TunneyCup>{{cite web |title=The USMC Challenge Trophy (The Tunney Cup) |publisher=Royal Marines Football Association |url=http://www.royalmarinesfootball.co.uk/tunney-cup.html |accessdate=2017-03-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223173143/http://www.royalmarinesfootball.co.uk/tunney-cup.html |archive-date=2016-02-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Royal Marines named the trophy the \"Tunney Cup,\" in honor of then\u2013USMC Captain Tunney, who, with Sergeant Major [[Charles Robert Francis|Charles R.

7, 1978) was an Irish American [[professional boxer]] who competed from 1915 to 1928. He held the world [[heavyweight]] title from 1926 to 1928, and the American [[light heavyweight]] title twice between 1922 and 1923. A highly technical boxer, Tunney had a five-fight light heavyweight rivalry with [[Harry Greb]] in which he won three, drew once, and lost once. He also knocked out [[Georges Carpentier]] and defeated [[Jack Dempsey]] twice; first in 1926 and again in 1927. Tunney's successful title defense against Dempsey remains one of the most famous bouts in boxing history and is known as [[The Long Count Fight]]. He retired undefeated as a heavyweight after his victory over [[Tom Heeney]] in 1928, after which Tunney was named [[Ring magazine Fighter of the Year|Fighter of the Year]] by [[The Ring (magazine)|''The Ring'' magazine]].\n\n==Early life==\nMary Lydon from Culleen House, Gorthgarve, [[Kiltimagh]], [[County Mayo]], Ireland, emigrated to the United States after the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]]. She settled in [[New York City]], where she met John Tunney, also from Cill Aodain, Kiltimagh. They married after a short courtship. The Tunneys had seven children; one son was murdered around 1920, another was a New York Police Department detective from 1924 to 1951, dying in 1971, while Gene would become famous as a World Heavyweight Boxing Champion.\nAt an early age, Tunney was inspired by President Theodore Roosevelt to become physically fit.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Edmund |title=The Rise of Theodore Roosevely |date=2001 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=9781400069651 |page=xvii}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Gene Tunney in Marine uniform.jpg|left|thumb|Tunney in Marine uniform]]\nTunney fought some 68 official professional fights, losing only one, to [[Harry Greb]], while fighting as a [[light heavyweight]].  Tunney fought many other fights whose scoring was unofficial, judged by newspaper reporters. He also lost none of these \"[[newspaper decision]]s.\"  He reported that he lost a second fight during World War I, a 10-round decision, to [[Tommy Loughran]], as a Marine before he began his professional boxing career. Tunney was regarded as an extremely skillful boxer who excelled in defense. In addition to beating Dempsey, the most famous fighter of his era, Tunney defeated [[Tommy Gibbons]], [[Georges Carpentier]] and many other fine boxers.\n\nAlready the U.S. Expeditionary Forces champion, Tunney spent the winter of 1921 as a [[lumberjack]] in northern [[Ontario]] for the J. R. Booth Company of [[Ottawa]], without revealing he was a champion boxer. He explained this as \"wanting the solitude and the strenuous labors of the woods to help condition himself for the career that appeared before him.\"<ref>{{Cite news |work=The Globe |date=September 28, 1926 |title=Tunney was Lumberjack for Ottawa Company |page=9}}</ref>\n\nTunney also had a brief [[acting]] career, starring in the movie ''[[The Fighting Marine]]'' in 1926. Unfortunately, no prints of this film are known to exist.\n\nHe was elected as [[Ring Magazine]]'s first-ever [[Ring Magazine fighters of the year|Fighter of the Year]] in 1928 and later elected to the [[World Boxing Hall of Fame]] in 1980, the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] in 1990 and the United States Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame in 2001.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1928, Tunney married a wealthy [[socialite]], the former [[Polly Lauder Tunney|Mary \"Polly\" Lauder]] (April 24, 1907 \u2013 April 19, 2008). Mrs. Tunney was born into the [[Lauder Greenway Family]]; her grandfather was billionaire [[George Lauder (Scottish industrialist)|George Lauder]], a first [[cousin]] and business partner of [[industrialist]] and [[philanthropist]] [[Andrew Carnegie]]. According to a 2007 [[biography]], Tunney promised Polly that he would quit boxing and defended his title only one more time after the second Dempsey fight, against [[Tom Heeney]] of New Zealand.\n\nAfter Mr. Tunney's retirement, the couple lived in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] and raised four children.<ref>https://www.leagle.com/decision/1981154242mhtcm150011197</ref> They had three boys including [[John V. Tunney|John Varick Tunney]] (1934\u20132018), who was a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] and [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[California]] from 1965 until 1977; Jonathan \"Jay\" Rowland Tunney of [[Stamford, Connecticut]]; and Gene Lauder Tunney (1931-2009)<ref>https://articles.latimes.com/1990-02-14/sports/sp-850_1_gene-tunney</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zhe2DKamMtEC&pg=RA1-PP7&lpg=RA1-PP7&dq=Tunney+Rosa | title=California.

Tunney's style was influenced by other noted boxing thinkers such as [[James J. Corbett]] and [[Benny Leonard]]. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to think of Tunney as a stick-and-move fighter in the Ali style. While Tunney's heavyweight fights against Gibbons, Carpentier, and Dempsey featured his fleet-footed movement and rapid-fire jabbing, his earlier bouts, especially the five against Harry Greb, demonstrated his vicious body punching and willingness to fight toe-to-toe. It was Benny Leonard who advised Tunney that the only way to beat Harry \"The Human Windmill\" Greb was to aim his punches at Greb's body rather than his head.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nAlways moving and boxing behind an excellent left jab, Tunney would study his opponents from the first bell. He generally preferred to stay outside and nullify any attacks, while using quick counters to keep the opponent off balance. In his fights against Jack Dempsey, today's viewer can see Tunney's style: hands held low for greater power, fast footwork that adjusts to every move his opponent makes and quick and accurate one-two style counter-punches with the left and right.\n\nTunney was never knocked out, while only ever being knocked down once, that in his second fight with Dempsey in the infamous [[The Long Count Fight|Long Count]]. This makes him one of only five Heavyweight champions, alongside [[Rocky Marciano]], [[Riddick Bowe]], [[Sultan Ibragimov]] and [[Nicolai Valuev]] to retire without ever suffering a stoppage defeat. Tunney, along with Marciano, Lewis and [[Vitali Klitschko]] is one of four heavyweight champions to have retired as champion and to have ended their career with a win in a world title fight. Having avenged his only defeat to [[Harry Greb]], with whom he also drew), Tunney joins [[Ingemar Johansson]], [[Rocky Marciano]], [[Lennox Lewis]] and [[Riddick Bowe]] as the only five heavyweight champions to have retired while holding a victory over every opponent he faced as a professional (barring no-contests).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Publications==\nIn 1932, Tunney published a book called ''A Man Must Fight'', in which he gave comments on his career and boxing techniques.\n\n==The Tunney Cup==\nIn 1928, the U.S. Marine Corps presented \u2013 as a sign of friendship \u2013 a challenge cup to the Corps of Royal Marines, in the hope it might be competed for by [[Royal Marines Football Association#Tunney Cup|Royal Marines association football]] teams.<ref name=RMhistory>{{cite web |title=A Brief History of the Royal Marines Football Association |first=Shaun |last=Foster |publisher=Royal Marines Football Association |url=http://www.royalmarinesfootball.co.uk/rm-football-history.html |accessdate=2017-03-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223171718/http://www.royalmarinesfootball.co.uk/rm-football-history.html |archive-date=2016-02-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=TunneyCup>{{cite web |title=The USMC Challenge Trophy (The Tunney Cup) |publisher=Royal Marines Football Association |url=http://www.royalmarinesfootball.co.uk/tunney-cup.html |accessdate=2017-03-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223173143/http://www.royalmarinesfootball.co.uk/tunney-cup.html |archive-date=2016-02-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Royal Marines named the trophy the \"Tunney Cup,\" in honor of then\u2013USMC Captain Tunney, who, with Sergeant Major [[Charles Robert Francis|Charles R.
