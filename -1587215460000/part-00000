The French finally established a state tontine in 1689<ref name=\"eb1911\" /> (though it was not described by that name because Tonti had died in disgrace, about five years earlier). The English government organised a tontine in 1693.<ref name=\"Milevsky\">Milevsky 2015.</ref> Nine further government tontines were organised in France down to 1759; four more in Britain down to 1789; and others in the Netherlands and some of the German states. Those in Britain were not fully subscribed, and in general the British schemes tended to be less popular and successful than their continental counterparts.<ref>Weir 1989, pp. 95\u2013124</ref>\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, the tontine had fallen out of favour as a revenue-raising instrument with governments, but smaller-scale and less formal tontines continued to be arranged between individuals or to raise funds for specific projects throughout the 19th century, and, in modified form, to the present day.<ref name=nytimes/>\n\n==Concept==\nEach investor pays a sum into the tontine. Each investor then receives annual [[interest]] on the [[Financial capital|capital]] invested. As each investor dies, his or her share is reallocated among the surviving investors. This process continues until the death of the final investor, when the scheme is wound up. Each subscriber receives only interest; the capital is never paid back.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\">Weir 1989, pp. 103\u2013104</ref>\n\nStrictly speaking, the transaction involves four different roles:<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\n# the government or corporate body which organizes the scheme, receives the loans and manages the capital\n# the subscribers who provide the capital\n# the shareholders who receive the annual interest\n# the nominees on whose lives the contracts are contingent\n\nIn most 18th- and 19th-century schemes, parties 2 to 4 were the same individuals; but in a significant minority of schemes each initial subscriber-shareholder was permitted to invest in the name of another party (generally one of his or her own children), who would inherit that share on the subscriber's death.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\nBecause younger nominees clearly had a longer life expectancy, the 17th- and 18th-century tontines were normally divided into several \"classes\" by age (typically in bands of 5, 7 or 10 years): each class effectively formed a separate tontine, with the shares of deceased members devolving to fellow-nominees within the same class.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\nIn a later variation, the capital devolves upon the last survivor, thus dissolving the trust and potentially making the survivor very wealthy.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}} This version has often provided the plot device for mysteries and detective stories.\n\n==Patent==\n[[File:Dousset 1792.png|thumb|right|First page of Dousset 1792 French patent for a tontine]][[Business method patent|Financial inventions were patentable]] under French law from January 1791 until September 1792.

The initial subscribers each put in 300 [[French livre|livres]] and, unlike most later schemes, this one was run honestly; the last survivor, a widow named Charlotte Barbier, who died in 1726 at the age of 96, received 73,000 livres in her last payment.<ref>Coudy 1957</ref><ref>Jennings and Trout 1982.</ref><ref name=\"Weir89\">Weir 1989.</ref> The English government first issued tontines in 1693 to fund a war against France, part of the [[Nine Years' War]].<ref name=\"Milevsky\"/><ref name=\"Weir89\"/>\n\nTontines soon caused financial problems for their issuing governments, as the organisers tended to underestimate the [[longevity]] of the population. At first, tontine holders included men and women of all ages. However, by the mid-18th century, investors were beginning to understand how to [[Gaming the system|game the system]], and it became increasingly common to buy tontine shares for young children, especially for girls around the age of 5 (since girls lived longer than boys, and by which age they were less at risk of infant mortality). This created the possibility of significant returns for the shareholders, with significant losses for the organizers. As a result, tontine schemes were eventually abandoned, and by the mid-1850s tontines had been replaced by other investment vehicles, such as \"[[penny policy|penny policies]]\", a predecessor of the 20th-century [[pension]] scheme.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}<!-- the previous paragraph mentions dishonestly-run tontines; there should be a discussion of those, too, and that phenomenon's role in the move to prohibit the tontine.-->\n\nA property development tontine, The Victoria Park Company, was at the heart of the notable case of ''[[Foss v Harbottle]]'' in mid-19th-century [[England]].{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}\n\n==Projects funded by tontines==\n[[File:Tontine coffee house.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Tontine Coffee House]] (at left) on [[Wall Street]], [[New York City]]]]\nTontines were often used to raise funds for private or [[public works]] projects.<ref>Green 2019.</ref> These sometimes contained the word \"tontine\" in their name.\n\nSome notable tontine-funded projects included:\n*[[Richmond Bridge, London|Richmond Bridge]], across the [[River Thames]] west of London, was financed using a tontine in 1774.\n*The Tontine Hotel in [[Ironbridge]], Shropshire, stands prominently at one end of the [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge]] from which the town takes its name: it was built in 1780\u201384 by the proprietors of the bridge to accommodate tourists who came to view this wonder of the industrial age.\n*The [[Glasgow Cross|Tontine Hotel and Assembly Rooms]], [[Glasgow]], were funded through two tontine of 1781 and 1796.\n*The [[Tontine Coffee House]] on [[Wall Street]] in [[New York City]], built in 1792, was the first home of the [[New York Stock Exchange]].\n*The first [[Freemasons' Hall, London]].

The French finally established a state tontine in 1689<ref name=\"eb1911\" /> (though it was not described by that name because Tonti had died in disgrace, about five years earlier). The English government organised a tontine in 1693.<ref name=\"Milevsky\">Milevsky 2015.</ref> Nine further government tontines were organised in France down to 1759; four more in Britain down to 1789; and others in the Netherlands and some of the German states. Those in Britain were not fully subscribed, and in general the British schemes tended to be less popular and successful than their continental counterparts.<ref>Weir 1989, pp. 95\u2013124</ref>\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, the tontine had fallen out of favour as a revenue-raising instrument with governments, but smaller-scale and less formal tontines continued to be arranged between individuals or to raise funds for specific projects throughout the 19th century, and, in modified form, to the present day.<ref name=nytimes/>\n\n==Concept==\nEach investor pays a sum into the tontine. Each investor then receives annual [[interest]] on the [[Financial capital|capital]] invested. As each investor dies, his or her share is reallocated among the surviving investors. This process continues until the death of the final investor, when the scheme is wound up. Each subscriber receives only interest; the capital is never paid back.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\">Weir 1989, pp. 103\u2013104</ref>\n\nStrictly speaking, the transaction involves four different roles:<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\n# the government or corporate body which organizes the scheme, receives the loans and manages the capital\n# the subscribers who provide the capital\n# the shareholders who receive the annual interest\n# the nominees on whose lives the contracts are contingent\n\nIn most 18th- and 19th-century schemes, parties 2 to 4 were the same individuals; but in a significant minority of schemes each initial subscriber-shareholder was permitted to invest in the name of another party (generally one of his or her own children), who would inherit that share on the subscriber's death.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\nBecause younger nominees clearly had a longer life expectancy, the 17th- and 18th-century tontines were normally divided into several \"classes\" by age (typically in bands of 5, 7 or 10 years): each class effectively formed a separate tontine, with the shares of deceased members devolving to fellow-nominees within the same class.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\nIn a later variation, the capital devolves upon the last survivor, thus dissolving the trust and potentially making the survivor very wealthy.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}} This version has often provided the plot device for mysteries and detective stories.\n\n==Patent==\n[[File:Dousset 1792.png|thumb|right|First page of Dousset 1792 French patent for a tontine]][[Business method patent|Financial inventions were patentable]] under French law from January 1791 until September 1792.

The initial subscribers each put in 300 [[French livre|livres]] and, unlike most later schemes, this one was run honestly; the last survivor, a widow named Charlotte Barbier, who died in 1726 at the age of 96, received 73,000 livres in her last payment.<ref>Coudy 1957</ref><ref>Jennings and Trout 1982.</ref><ref name=\"Weir89\">Weir 1989.</ref> The English government first issued tontines in 1693 to fund a war against France, part of the [[Nine Years' War]].<ref name=\"Milevsky\"/><ref name=\"Weir89\"/>\n\nTontines soon caused financial problems for their issuing governments, as the organisers tended to underestimate the [[longevity]] of the population. At first, tontine holders included men and women of all ages. However, by the mid-18th century, investors were beginning to understand how to [[Gaming the system|game the system]], and it became increasingly common to buy tontine shares for young children, especially for girls around the age of 5 (since girls lived longer than boys, and by which age they were less at risk of infant mortality). This created the possibility of significant returns for the shareholders, with significant losses for the organizers. As a result, tontine schemes were eventually abandoned, and by the mid-1850s tontines had been replaced by other investment vehicles, such as \"[[penny policy|penny policies]]\", a predecessor of the 20th-century [[pension]] scheme.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}<!-- the previous paragraph mentions dishonestly-run tontines; there should be a discussion of those, too, and that phenomenon's role in the move to prohibit the tontine.-->\n\nA property development tontine, The Victoria Park Company, was at the heart of the notable case of ''[[Foss v Harbottle]]'' in mid-19th-century [[England]].{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}\n\n==Projects funded by tontines==\n[[File:Tontine coffee house.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Tontine Coffee House]] (at left) on [[Wall Street]], [[New York City]]]]\nTontines were often used to raise funds for private or [[public works]] projects.<ref>Green 2019.</ref> These sometimes contained the word \"tontine\" in their name.\n\nSome notable tontine-funded projects included:\n*[[Richmond Bridge, London|Richmond Bridge]], across the [[River Thames]] west of London, was financed using a tontine in 1774.\n*The Tontine Hotel in [[Ironbridge]], Shropshire, stands prominently at one end of the [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge]] from which the town takes its name: it was built in 1780\u201384 by the proprietors of the bridge to accommodate tourists who came to view this wonder of the industrial age.\n*The [[Glasgow Cross|Tontine Hotel and Assembly Rooms]], [[Glasgow]], were funded through two tontine of 1781 and 1796.\n*The [[Tontine Coffee House]] on [[Wall Street]] in [[New York City]], built in 1792, was the first home of the [[New York Stock Exchange]].\n*The first [[Freemasons' Hall, London]].

Over the next four decades, the Equitable and its imitators sold approximately 9 million policies \u2013 two-thirds of the nation's outstanding insurance contracts.

A physician, hoping to raise the funds to give his daughter a dowry, buys a tontine on the life of an elderly peasant, who he then strives to keep alive.\n*''The Great Tontine'' (1881), is a novel by [[Henry Hawley Smart|Hawley Smart]].\n*''[[The Wrong Box (novel)|The Wrong Box]]'' (1889), is a comic novel by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and [[Lloyd Osbourne]]. The plot revolves around a tontine originally taken out for some wealthy English children, and the resulting shenanigans as younger family members of the two final survivors vie to secure the final payout. The book was adapted as a [[The Wrong Box|film]], produced and directed by [[Bryan Forbes]], (1966).\n*''The Secret Tontine'' (1912), is an atmospheric faux-gothic novel by [[Robert Murray Gilchrist]], set in the [[Derbyshire]] [[Peak District]] during a snowy winter in the late 19th century. The plot involves the potential beneficiaries of a covert tontine, and their scheme to murder their ignorant rivals. \n*[[Lillian de la Torre]]'s short story \"The Tontine Curse\" (1948) features mysterious deaths related to a tontine in 1779, being investigated by [[Samuel Johnson]].\n*''The Tontine'' (1955), a novel by [[Thomas B. Costain]], illustrated by [[Herbert Ryman]], is set in nineteenth-century England and tells a story centered around the fictional \"Waterloo Tontine\", established to benefit veterans of the Napoleonic wars. Among other plot twists, shareholders hire an actor to impersonate a dead nominee, and conspire to murder another member.\n*In ''[[4.50 from Paddington]]'' (1957), a [[Miss Marple]] murder mystery by [[Agatha Christie]], the plot revolves around the will of a wealthy industrialist, which establishes a [[Settlement (trust)|settlement]] under which his estate is divided in trust among his grandchildren, the final survivor to inherit the whole. The settlement is described, inaccurately, as a tontine. \n*''[[Something Fishy]]'' (1957), a novel by [[P. G. Wodehouse]], features a so-called tontine under which the investors' sons stand to gain from marrying late.\n* In the U.S. television series ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'', Episode 16 of Season Two (1966\u201367) \u2013 \"The Night of the Tottering Tontine\" \u2013 finds James West and Artemus Gordon protecting a man who is a member of a tontine whose members are being murdered one by another.\n*\"Old Soldiers,\" an eighth-season episode of the television series ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', focuses on a tontine set up among Colonel Potter and several of his Army buddies from [[World War I]]. While taking shelter in a ch\u00e2teau during an artillery barrage, they had found a cache of brandy and drank all but one bottle, which they set aside for the last survivor.

Grampa eventually kicks Burns out of the tontine for trying to kill him, but before he and Bart can do anything with the art, a descendant of the original owner shows up to claim it.\n*In [[S. L. Viehl]]'s science fiction multi-volume novel ''Stardoc'' (2000), the title character is accused of spreading a plague to several colony worlds, on one of which the colonists had established a tontine. The sole survivor, a little girl, consequently becomes so wealthy that in the second book of the series \u2013 ''Beyond Varallan'' (2000) \u2013 she buys the bank behind the colonies to free the Stardoc from the debt she now owes.\n*The 2001 comedy film ''[[Tomcats (2001 film)|Tomcats]]'' features a variation on a tontine where the last investor to get married gets the full amount of the invested funds.\n* In the ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'' episode \"The Double Deuce\" (2011), Archer's [[valet]] Woodhouse is revealed as one of three final survivors of a group of World War I [[Royal Flying Corps]] squadron mates who each put [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]50 into an interest-bearing account, now worth nearly a million [[United States dollar|dollars]]. The office workers at ISIS HQ, realizing that a new tontine could capitalize on the high mortality rate of field agents, begin persuading people to join.\n* The ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'' episode \"Being of Sound Mind\" (Season 8 Episode 16) features a tontine as a motive for murder.\n*The ''[[The Brokenwood Mysteries|Brokenwood Mysteries]]'' episode \"Tontine\" (Season 5 Episode 3) centres on a tontine.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book|last=Buley|first=R.

They were [[commemorative stamp]]s since they celebrated the islands' new status as a [[self-governing colony]] following a new constitution in 1921, but also a [[Definitive stamp|definitive issue]] intended for regular use over an extended period of time.\n\nDesigned by two leading Maltese artists, [[Edward Caruana Dingli (artist)|Edward Caruana Dingli]] and [[Gianni Vella]], the issue consisted of stamps in various denominations from \u00bc[[pence|d]] to [[\u00a3sd|\u00a3]]1; Caruana Dingli's designs were used on the pence and pound values and Vella's design on the shilling values. The designs were poorly received when they were issued, and Caruana Dingli himself criticized the execution of the design. In subsequent years, however, Caruana Dingli's design came to be regarded as one of the most iconic Malta stamps, and his design for the figure of Melita formed the basis of the [[Maltese lira]] banknotes of 1989\u20132008 and gold [[bullion coin]]s minted since 2018.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Malta 1899 Melita 2s6d olive-grey.jpg|thumb|left|The 1899 Melita stamp]]\n\nThe oldest known depiction of a personification of Malta dates back to 1481.

The former included a [[Bicameralism|bicameral legislature]] with a [[Senate of Malta|Senate]] and [[Parliament of Malta|Legislative Assembly]], while the Imperial Government was led by the [[List of Governors of Malta|Governor of Malta]], a British colonial official who retained direct responsibility of certain reserved matters such as defence and maintaining public order.<ref name=\"bephila\">{{cite web|title=Melita Issue of Malta Stamps: 1922\u201326|url=http://www.bephila.com/articles/melita-issue-of-malta-stamps-1922-26|website=British Empire Philately|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316113650/http://www.bephila.com/articles/melita-issue-of-malta-stamps-1922-26|archivedate=16 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cassar |first1=Carmel |title=A Concise History of Malta |date=2000 |publisher=Mireva Publications |location=[[Msida]] |isbn=1870579526 |page=204}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 June 1921, a [[design competition|competition]] was announced calling for the design of a set of stamps to commemorate Malta's partial independence.

The typographed stamps were printed on chalk-surfaced paper. Each stamp was printed in two operations, with a [[Key type stamp|key plate and a duty plate]]. In most cases each plate was printed in a different colour, but for some of the low values both plates were printed in the same colour.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nThe [[watermark]] used on the stamps is known as ''Multiple Script CA'', since it consists of the letters \"CA\" (referring to the [[Crown Agents]]) in a script typeface, beneath a representation of the [[Tudor Crown (heraldry)|Tudor crown]], arranged multiple times next to each other. The watermark was sideways for the pence values and upright for the shilling values. The \u00a31 was initially printed with an upright watermark but in 1925 it was also issued with a sideways watermark.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nThe pence values were printed in sheets of 160 stamps (consisting of two panes, each containing 8 rows of 10 stamps, separated by a [[Gutter (philately)|gutter]]), the shilling values were printed in sheets of 80 (one pane of 8 rows of 10 stamps) and the \u00a31 value was printed in sheets of 40 (one pane of 4 rows of 10 stamps).<ref name=\"bephila\"/> The stamps were perforated with [[Perforation gauge|gauge]] 14.2 by 14 comb perforations.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nA number of [[Die proof (philately)|die proofs]] and plate proofs of stamps from the Melita issue exist.

Plate proofs, which are test printings made from the stamps' printings plates, exist of the \u00bcd, \u00bdd, 1d, 3d and \u00a31 values in unissued colours.

Despite this, some stamps with errors still ended up in circulation, including the 3d value with the overprint inverted, and various denominations with the overprints misplaced to varying degrees, the most notable being a variety of the 4d in which the overprint reads \"AGE POST\".<ref name=\"invert\"/>\n\n===3d with inverted overprint===\n[[File:Malta 1926 Melita Postage 3d black on yellow overprint inverted.jpg|thumb|The 3d with the \"POSTAGE\" overprint inverted]]\n\nThe 3d black on yellow is known with the [[Invert error|overprint inverted]], and it is one of Malta's best-known error stamps. It is believed that only two sheets of the error were printed, and they were allegedly acquired on the first day of issue by Alfredo Caruana Gatto, a [[Maltese Political Union]] politician who was a member of the Senate and who had been Minister for Justice in 1921\u201322. The exact circumstances of their issue remain unclear, and it is not known whether they were acquired over the Post Office counter or not. Caruana Gatto is said to have immediately sold the two sheets to Carol Saliba and Pio Grech, and the sheets were eventually broken down and sold to stamp dealers and collectors. A small amount of the error stamps were used on mail by philatelists, but the vast majority were retained in [[Mint stamp|mint condition]].<ref name=\"invert\"/>\n\nIn 1930, uncertainty about the stamp's issue formed the basis of a political campaign by the [[Constitutional Party (Malta)|Constitutional Party]] against the [[Nationalist Party (Malta)|Nationalist Party]] which became known as the \"Postage Stamps Scandal\". The matter was brought up in the Legislative Assembly on 31 March 1930 when Constitutional Party member Alfred Gera De Petri asked Robert Hamilton, the Minister for Posts, about the circumstances of the stamp's issue. A committee was later appointed to investigate the matter, and it included [[Gerald Strickland, 1st Baron Strickland|Gerald Strickland]], Hamilton, Walter Salomone, [[Paul Boffa]] and [[Ugo Pasquale Mifsud]].<ref name=\"invert\"/>\n\nThe committee members belonging to the Constitutional Party produced a report in which they stated that there was no evidence that the error was ever sold at a Post Office or that Caruana Gatto (who had died in 1926) had sold the stamps. They concluded that the inverted overprint was applied at the Government Printing Office without authorisation to sheets of genuine stamps which were not part of the Post Office stock, meaning that the overprints were forged. Boffa mentioned that the overprinting might have even been done outside the Government Printing Office, while Mifsud only agreed with the conclusion that there was no evidence of Caruana Gatto's involvement in the matter. There were gaps in the evidence collected by the committee, and it did not produce any arguments which countered various opinions that the overprints were the result of a genuine mistake, making its findings inconclusive.

They were [[commemorative stamp]]s since they celebrated the islands' new status as a [[self-governing colony]] following a new constitution in 1921, but also a [[Definitive stamp|definitive issue]] intended for regular use over an extended period of time.\n\nDesigned by two leading Maltese artists, [[Edward Caruana Dingli (artist)|Edward Caruana Dingli]] and [[Gianni Vella]], the issue consisted of stamps in various denominations from \u00bc[[pence|d]] to [[\u00a3sd|\u00a3]]1; Caruana Dingli's designs were used on the pence and pound values and Vella's design on the shilling values. The designs were poorly received when they were issued, and Caruana Dingli himself criticized the execution of the design. In subsequent years, however, Caruana Dingli's design came to be regarded as one of the most iconic Malta stamps, and his design for the figure of Melita formed the basis of the [[Maltese lira]] banknotes of 1989\u20132008 and gold [[bullion coin]]s minted since 2018.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Malta 1899 Melita 2s6d olive-grey.jpg|thumb|left|The 1899 Melita stamp]]\n\nThe oldest known depiction of a personification of Malta dates back to 1481.

This divided control of Malta between two governments: the Maltese Government and the Maltese Imperial Government. The former included a [[Bicameralism|bicameral legislature]] with a [[Senate of Malta|Senate]] and [[Parliament of Malta|Legislative Assembly]], while the Imperial Government was led by the [[List of Governors of Malta|Governor of Malta]], a British colonial official who retained direct responsibility of certain reserved matters such as defence and maintaining public order.<ref name=\"bephila\">{{cite web|title=Melita Issue of Malta Stamps: 1922\u201326|url=http://www.bephila.com/articles/melita-issue-of-malta-stamps-1922-26|website=British Empire Philately|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316113650/http://www.bephila.com/articles/melita-issue-of-malta-stamps-1922-26|archivedate=16 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cassar |first1=Carmel |title=A Concise History of Malta |date=2000 |publisher=Mireva Publications |location=[[Msida]] |isbn=1870579526 |page=204}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 June 1921, a [[design competition|competition]] was announced calling for the design of a set of stamps to commemorate Malta's partial independence. The stamps were therefore to be [[commemorative stamp|commemoratives]], but they were also intended as [[Definitive stamp|definitives]] for regular use over an extended period of time.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nThe Maltese wanted to issue the new stamps by the time the new parliament was inaugurated on 1 November 1921. There was not enough time for the stamps to be produced and delivered within that timeframe, however, since the printers [[De La Rue]] had to deal with a large workload, causing delays. The Malta Post Office therefore decided to overprint the then-current definitives (which depicted King [[George V]] and some pictorial scenes, including the 1919 reprint of the 1899 Melita design) with the words \"SELF-GOVERNMENT\" diagonally to commemorate the new constitution.<ref name=\"bephila\"/> The overprinting was carried out by the Government Printing Office in the capital [[Valletta]], and the stamps were released between 12 January and 29 April 1922.<ref name=\"sg\"/>\n\n==Design==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 320\n | image_style = border:none;\n | image1 = Malta -mix- 2019 by-RaBoe 260.jpg\n | alt1 = A lighthouse\n | image2 = Gozo boat cropped.jpg\n | alt2 = Painting of a boat\n | footer = The St Elmo lighthouse and a [[Gozo boat]] (painting pictured) are depicted in the background of Caruana Dingli's design\n}}\n\nTwo designs were chosen from the competition, one by [[Edward Caruana Dingli (artist)|Edward Caruana Dingli]] and one by [[Gianni Vella]]. Caruana Dingli's design was used for ten denominations: the [[Penny|pence]] values ranging from \u00bcd to 6d, and also the highest value of the set, the [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]1. Vella's design was used for the five [[shilling]] values ranging from 1/- to 10/-.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nCaruana Dingli's design depicts [[Melita (personification)|Melita]] as a robed and helmeted figure holding a [[rudder]], representing Malta as being in control of her own destiny.<ref name=\"cbm-bullion\"/> The background contains a seascape, with the lighthouse near [[Fort Saint Elmo]] and a [[Gozo boat]] visible.

The typographed stamps were printed on chalk-surfaced paper. Each stamp was printed in two operations, with a [[Key type stamp|key plate and a duty plate]]. In most cases each plate was printed in a different colour, but for some of the low values both plates were printed in the same colour.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nThe [[watermark]] used on the stamps is known as ''Multiple Script CA'', since it consists of the letters \"CA\" (referring to the [[Crown Agents]]) in a script typeface, beneath a representation of the [[Tudor Crown (heraldry)|Tudor crown]], arranged multiple times next to each other. The watermark was sideways for the pence values and upright for the shilling values. The \u00a31 was initially printed with an upright watermark but in 1925 it was also issued with a sideways watermark.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nThe pence values were printed in sheets of 160 stamps (consisting of two panes, each containing 8 rows of 10 stamps, separated by a [[Gutter (philately)|gutter]]), the shilling values were printed in sheets of 80 (one pane of 8 rows of 10 stamps) and the \u00a31 value was printed in sheets of 40 (one pane of 4 rows of 10 stamps).<ref name=\"bephila\"/> The stamps were perforated with [[Perforation gauge|gauge]] 14.2 by 14 comb perforations.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nA number of [[Die proof (philately)|die proofs]] and plate proofs of stamps from the Melita issue exist. Die proofs are individual prints from the stamps' original [[Die (philately)|die]]s made at various stages of production, and are impressions of either the key die or the duty die of each value, or composite die proofs of both dies together. Plate proofs, which are test printings made from the stamps' printings plates, exist of the \u00bcd, \u00bdd, 1d, 3d and \u00a31 values in unissued colours. A wide range of versions of these exist, either perforated or imperforate, on unwatermarked or watermarked paper, and with or without a [[Specimen stamp|specimen overprint]].

A small amount of the error stamps were used on mail by philatelists, but the vast majority were retained in [[Mint stamp|mint condition]].<ref name=\"invert\"/>\n\nIn 1930, uncertainty about the stamp's issue formed the basis of a political campaign by the [[Constitutional Party (Malta)|Constitutional Party]] against the [[Nationalist Party (Malta)|Nationalist Party]] which became known as the \"Postage Stamps Scandal\". The matter was brought up in the Legislative Assembly on 31 March 1930 when Constitutional Party member Alfred Gera De Petri asked Robert Hamilton, the Minister for Posts, about the circumstances of the stamp's issue. A committee was later appointed to investigate the matter, and it included [[Gerald Strickland, 1st Baron Strickland|Gerald Strickland]], Hamilton, Walter Salomone, [[Paul Boffa]] and [[Ugo Pasquale Mifsud]].<ref name=\"invert\"/>\n\nThe committee members belonging to the Constitutional Party produced a report in which they stated that there was no evidence that the error was ever sold at a Post Office or that Caruana Gatto (who had died in 1926) had sold the stamps. They concluded that the inverted overprint was applied at the Government Printing Office without authorisation to sheets of genuine stamps which were not part of the Post Office stock, meaning that the overprints were forged. Boffa mentioned that the overprinting might have even been done outside the Government Printing Office, while Mifsud only agreed with the conclusion that there was no evidence of Caruana Gatto's involvement in the matter. There were gaps in the evidence collected by the committee, and it did not produce any arguments which countered various opinions that the overprints were the result of a genuine mistake, making its findings inconclusive. The committee's report was criticized in the press.<ref name=\"invert\"/>\n\nPhilatelists regard the inverted overprint as a genuine error,<ref name=\"sg\"/> even though its exact origins remain unknown.<ref name=\"invert\">{{cite journal |last1=Ganado |first1=Albert |title=The Melita 3d.

It is located on the banks of the [[Beas River]] in the [[#Kullu Valley|Kullu Valley]] about {{convert|10|km}} north of the airport at [[Bhuntar]].\n\n[[Kullu Valley]] is a broad open [[valley]] formed by the [[Beas River]] between [[Manali, Himachal Pradesh|Manali]] and Largi. This valley is known for its temples and its hills covered with [[pine]] and [[Cedrus deodara|deodar]] forest and sprawling apple orchards. The course of the Beas river presents a succession of magnificent, clad with forests of deodar, towering above trees of pine on the lower rocky ridges. Kullu valley is sandwiched between the [[Pir Panjal Range|Pir Panjal]], Lower Himalayan and [[Great_Himalayas|Great Himalayan Ranges]].\n\n==History==\n\nHistorical references about the Kullu valley dates back to ancient Hindu literary works of [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharata]] and the [[Puranas]].<ref>http://himachal.gov.in/index1.php?lang=1&dpt_id=200&level=1&lid=8449&sublinkid=8216</ref> During Vedic period several small republics known as \"[[Janapada]]\" existed which were later conquered by the [[Nanda Empire]], [[Mauryan Empire]], [[Gupta Empire]], [[Pala Dynasty]] and [[Karko\u1e6da Empire]].

As per legends, during the Great Flood, Manu visited this valley but was unable to cross the Rohtang pass. He named the last settlement he found as Kulant Peeth and chose to settle and meditate in what has now become the town of Manali (Manu's Place). The name further devolved into \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=sjSiPRXZwscC&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=kulut+kullu&source=bl&ots=FVbqtDY5GE&sig=wxlmqlBaE6qsoF8jPf7PAz9dEmA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi13_na26zNAhUDsJQKHW_6AkYQ6AEIEzAC#v=onepage&q=kulut%20kullu&f=false Kulut]\", as the kingdom was known for a long time; before finally being known by the current name of Kullu or Kulu.\n\nThe [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] pilgrim monk [[Xuanzang]] visited the Kullu Valley in 634 or 635 CE. He described it as a fertile region completely surrounded by mountains, about 3,000 ''li'' in circuit, with a capital 14 or 15 ''li'' in circumference.

It is located on the banks of the [[Beas River]] in the [[#Kullu Valley|Kullu Valley]] about {{convert|10|km}} north of the airport at [[Bhuntar]].\n\n[[Kullu Valley]] is a broad open [[valley]] formed by the [[Beas River]] between [[Manali, Himachal Pradesh|Manali]] and Largi. This valley is known for its temples and its hills covered with [[pine]] and [[Cedrus deodara|deodar]] forest and sprawling apple orchards. The course of the Beas river presents a succession of magnificent, clad with forests of deodar, towering above trees of pine on the lower rocky ridges. Kullu valley is sandwiched between the [[Pir Panjal Range|Pir Panjal]], Lower Himalayan and [[Great_Himalayas|Great Himalayan Ranges]].\n\n==History==\n\nHistorical references about the Kullu valley dates back to ancient Hindu literary works of [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharata]] and the [[Puranas]].<ref>http://himachal.gov.in/index1.php?lang=1&dpt_id=200&level=1&lid=8449&sublinkid=8216</ref> During Vedic period several small republics known as \"[[Janapada]]\" existed which were later conquered by the [[Nanda Empire]], [[Mauryan Empire]], [[Gupta Empire]], [[Pala Dynasty]] and [[Karko\u1e6da Empire]]. After a brief period of supremacy by King [[Harshavardhana]], the region was once again divided into several local powers headed by chieftains, including some [[Rajput]] principalities, these principalities were later conquered by [[Maratha Empire]] and [[Sikh Empire]].{{sfn|Verma|1995|pp = 28\u201335, ''Historical Perspective''}}\n\nThe name Kullu derives from the word \"Kulant Peeth\", meaning \"end of the habitable world\". As per legends, during the Great Flood, Manu visited this valley but was unable to cross the Rohtang pass. He named the last settlement he found as Kulant Peeth and chose to settle and meditate in what has now become the town of Manali (Manu's Place). The name further devolved into \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=sjSiPRXZwscC&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=kulut+kullu&source=bl&ots=FVbqtDY5GE&sig=wxlmqlBaE6qsoF8jPf7PAz9dEmA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi13_na26zNAhUDsJQKHW_6AkYQ6AEIEzAC#v=onepage&q=kulut%20kullu&f=false Kulut]\", as the kingdom was known for a long time; before finally being known by the current name of Kullu or Kulu.\n\nThe [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] pilgrim monk [[Xuanzang]] visited the Kullu Valley in 634 or 635 CE. He described it as a fertile region completely surrounded by mountains, about 3,000 ''li'' in circuit, with a capital 14 or 15 ''li'' in circumference. It contained a [[Stupa]] built by [[Mauryan Empire|Mauryan Emperor]] [[Ashoka]], which is said to mark the place where the Buddha preached to the local people and made conversions, [[Stupa]] was taken away by a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] ruler and put in Feroz shah Kotla maidan in [[Delhi]]. There were some twenty Buddhist monasteries, with about 1,000 monks, most of whom were [[Mahayanist]]. There were also some fifteen Hindu temples, and people of both faiths lived mixed together. There were meditation caves near the mountain passes inhabited by both Buddhist and Hindu practitioners. The country is said to have produced gold, silver, red copper, crystal lenses and bell-metal.<ref>Watters (1904-1905), pp. 298, 335.</ref>\n\nKullu got its first motorable access only after [[Partition of India|Indian Independence]].

The term is also occasionally used in a pejorative sense during elections where a small number of independent political candidate(s) who hold a sizeable sway in the \"vote bank\" can most likely decide the course of an outcome.\n\nAs well as referring to an individual, the term can also be applied to institutions or think tanks whose opinions are held in great regard by the interested organization. The influence of the religious orders like the Roman Catholic Church in running the affairs of the state during medieval times (through the king) is a well-known example. Kingdoms and empires in the Indian sub-continent often relied on their religious heads. Besides religious orders, even countries can fit into this terminology when they can dictate the affairs of the other country (either directly or indirectly). In current political scenarios across the world the term can expand its scope to include powerful [[lobbying]] groups, whose role is often seen as a defining factor on major issues.\n\nCitizens of [[West Africa]]n sub-national monarchies often use the word ''kingmaker'' to refer to the members of the electoral colleges that choose their sovereigns because they also usually officiate during the coronation rituals and rites of purification, the word in this particular case taking on a literal meaning i.e. a ''maker'' of the king.\n\nThe term \"kingmaker\" is also used to describe situations in multi-player games where a player is either unable to win or has claimed an unassailable lead, but, in either case, plays a strong role in determining the outcome for other players.\n\n==In fiction==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\n* The character [[Leon Fortunato]] from the ''[[Left Behind (series)|Left Behind]]'' series of novels is often described as a kingmaker.\n* Marcus Jefferson Wall, the antagonist of much of the [[Matador series]] by Steve Perry is called the Kingmaker, and controls the President of the Galactic Federation\n* The character [[Mayvar|Mayvar Kingmaker]] from the ''[[Saga of the Exiles]]'' series of novels tests the ability of aspirants before they can be proclaimed king of the [[Saga of Pliocene Exile#Tanu and Firvulag|Tanu]].\n* Ser Criston Cole, a character from [[George R.&nbsp;R.

The term is also occasionally used in a pejorative sense during elections where a small number of independent political candidate(s) who hold a sizeable sway in the \"vote bank\" can most likely decide the course of an outcome.\n\nAs well as referring to an individual, the term can also be applied to institutions or think tanks whose opinions are held in great regard by the interested organization. The influence of the religious orders like the Roman Catholic Church in running the affairs of the state during medieval times (through the king) is a well-known example. Kingdoms and empires in the Indian sub-continent often relied on their religious heads. Besides religious orders, even countries can fit into this terminology when they can dictate the affairs of the other country (either directly or indirectly). In current political scenarios across the world the term can expand its scope to include powerful [[lobbying]] groups, whose role is often seen as a defining factor on major issues.\n\nCitizens of [[West Africa]]n sub-national monarchies often use the word ''kingmaker'' to refer to the members of the electoral colleges that choose their sovereigns because they also usually officiate during the coronation rituals and rites of purification, the word in this particular case taking on a literal meaning i.e. a ''maker'' of the king.\n\nThe term \"kingmaker\" is also used to describe situations in multi-player games where a player is either unable to win or has claimed an unassailable lead, but, in either case, plays a strong role in determining the outcome for other players.\n\n==In fiction==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\n* The character [[Leon Fortunato]] from the ''[[Left Behind (series)|Left Behind]]'' series of novels is often described as a kingmaker.\n* Marcus Jefferson Wall, the antagonist of much of the [[Matador series]] by Steve Perry is called the Kingmaker, and controls the President of the Galactic Federation\n* The character [[Mayvar|Mayvar Kingmaker]] from the ''[[Saga of the Exiles]]'' series of novels tests the ability of aspirants before they can be proclaimed king of the [[Saga of Pliocene Exile#Tanu and Firvulag|Tanu]].\n* Ser Criston Cole, a character from [[George R.&nbsp;R. Martin]]\u2019s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series, is commonly referred to as \"the kingmaker\".\n* Minato Yoko, a character from [[Kamen Rider Gaim]], considers herself a kingmaker, wanting to see who has what it takes to take the Forbidden Fruit, a fruit of great power that can essentially make a person a king. Likewise, another character, Mitsuzane Kureshima, also has traits of a kingmaker, hanging around with and manipulating events so as to put the ruler in his favor.\n* Harry Leong, the ultra-rich, secretive billionaire from ''[[Crazy Rich Asians]]'', is revealed to be one of the kingmakers in the government of Singapore.\n* One of the villains in the NBC TV series ''[[The Blacklist (TV series)|The Blacklist]]'' went under the alias ''The Kingmaker''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Political terminology]]\n", "name_user": "Toweli", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingmaker"}

North of [[Devore, California|Devore]], the highway follows the approximate alignment of historic [[U.S. Highway 66]] along with [[U.S. Highway 91]] and [[U.S. Highway 395]]. U.S. 395 breaks away at Hesperia and the route continues on a direct path to [[Barstow, California|Barstow]] {{convert|35|mi|km|0}} to the north. Meanwhile, the old alignments of U.S. 91 and U.S. 66 follow the [[Mojave River]] from [[Victorville, California|Victorville]] to Barstow along the [[National Old Trails Road|National Trails Highway]]. At that point, I-15 follows the old route of U.S. 91 exclusively as U.S. 66 turned east toward [[Needles, California|Needles]]. For many parts of the highway, high-voltage [[electric power transmission|power line]]s, such as [[Path 46]] and [[Path 27]], almost all originating from the [[Hoover Dam]], follow the freeway. Many of these link distant power stations to the [[Los Angeles]] metropolitan area.\n\nThe southern starting point of Interstate 15 was in 1957 planned to be in [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], at the interchange with the San Bernardino Freeway (then US 70/99, now [[Interstate 10|I-10]]). This was logical as I-15 was following the old alignment of the historic Route 66 which passed through San Bernardino. The segment was completed accordingly.\n\nIn 1964, legislation was later passed to extend the interstate to [[San Diego]]. Instead of extending the existing freeway from the I-10 interchange south, however, the [[California Department of Transportation]] drew a new segment in Devore that \"branched\" off of the original alignment and bypassed San Bernardino altogether. This segment's alignment is generally northeast to southwest for about {{convert|13|mi|km|0}}. Then, in [[Rancho Cucamonga, California|Rancho Cucamonga]], its directional alignment shifts to north\u2013south where it eventually meets with Interstate 10 (about {{convert|15|mi|km}} west of the original interchange in San Bernardino). The segment that had been built from Devore to San Bernardino was retained as an interstate, but was re-numbered as [[Interstate 215 (California)|Interstate 215]]. Note that during the construction of I-15's present alignment, and for some time afterwards, I-215 was numbered as I-15E, and its actual mileage would begin at Interstate 10. I-15 runs for a total of {{convert|287|mi|km|0}} in California.\n\n===Nevada===\n[[File:Interstate_15,_Las_Vegas,_South_of_Flight_Path_on_Departure_(14203692275).jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of I-15 looking south from Sunset Road in the [[Las Vegas Valley]] ]]\n{{main|Interstate 15 in Nevada}}\nInterstate 15 begins in [[Primm, Nevada|Primm]] and continues through [[Las Vegas]] along the [[Las Vegas Strip]] corridor.

It is the main north\u2013south connection for the state. The highway approximately follows the old alignment of [[U.S. Highway 91]] from [[St. George, Utah|St. George]] to [[Brigham City, Utah|Brigham City]]. The highway passes through the fast-growing [[Utah's Dixie]] region in the southwestern part of the state, which includes [[St. George, Utah|St. George]], [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]], and eventually most of the major cities and suburbs along the [[Wasatch Front]], including [[Provo, Utah|Provo]], [[Orem, Utah|Orem]], [[Sandy, Utah|Sandy]], [[Salt Lake City]], [[Layton, Utah|Layton]], and [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]]. Near [[Cove Fort, Utah|Cove Fort]], [[Interstate 70]] begins its journey eastward across the country. The interstate [[Concurrency (road)|merges]] with [[Interstate 80|I-80]] for about {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} from [[South Salt Lake, Utah|South Salt Lake]] to just west of [[Downtown Salt Lake City]] and also merges with [[Interstate 84 in Utah|Interstate 84]] from [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]] to [[Tremonton, Utah|Tremonton]]. Along nearly its entire length through the state, I-15 winds its way along the western edge of a nearly continuous range of mountains (the [[Wasatch Range]] in the northern half of the state). The only exceptions are north of [[Cove Fort, Utah|Cove Fort]] and when it passes between [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]] and St. George, known as the Black Ridge, a transition zone of drastic change in elevation and climate, an area where the eastern [[Great Basin]], [[Colorado Plateau]] and [[Mojave Desert]] converge.\n\n===Idaho===\n{{main|Interstate 15 in Idaho}}\n[[File:I 15 US 20 Junction Sign.jpg|left|thumb|I-15/US-20 Jct. in [[Idaho Falls|Idaho Falls, ID]]]]\nI-15 passes through [[Idaho]] for {{convert|196|mi|km|0}}.

Once Interstate 15 was relatively intact, U.S. 91 was decommissioned, except for one part in Northern Utah/Southern Idaho where Interstate 15 instead followed the route of former [[U.S. Route 191]].\n\nInterstate 15 originally had two suffixed routes. In California, Interstate 15 had an eastern branch bypassing [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], which was designated Interstate 15E. I-15E was renumbered and is now [[Interstate 215 (California)|Interstate 215]]. Present day routing of Interstate 15 in California was originally given \"I-15W\" as its title while it was under construction (the original asphalt portions from Temescal Canyon to Ontario Avenue were dubbed I-15W on maps until 1974), but was never officially signed as such.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-215_ca.html |title = entry for Interstate 215 California |publisher = Interstate-guide.com |date = |accessdate = November 27, 2011 }}</ref> In Idaho, I-15 had a western branch near [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]] that connected I-15 and I-84 (then I-80N).

North of [[Devore, California|Devore]], the highway follows the approximate alignment of historic [[U.S. Highway 66]] along with [[U.S. Highway 91]] and [[U.S. Highway 395]]. U.S. 395 breaks away at Hesperia and the route continues on a direct path to [[Barstow, California|Barstow]] {{convert|35|mi|km|0}} to the north. Meanwhile, the old alignments of U.S. 91 and U.S. 66 follow the [[Mojave River]] from [[Victorville, California|Victorville]] to Barstow along the [[National Old Trails Road|National Trails Highway]]. At that point, I-15 follows the old route of U.S. 91 exclusively as U.S. 66 turned east toward [[Needles, California|Needles]]. For many parts of the highway, high-voltage [[electric power transmission|power line]]s, such as [[Path 46]] and [[Path 27]], almost all originating from the [[Hoover Dam]], follow the freeway. Many of these link distant power stations to the [[Los Angeles]] metropolitan area.\n\nThe southern starting point of Interstate 15 was in 1957 planned to be in [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], at the interchange with the San Bernardino Freeway (then US 70/99, now [[Interstate 10|I-10]]). This was logical as I-15 was following the old alignment of the historic Route 66 which passed through San Bernardino. The segment was completed accordingly.\n\nIn 1964, legislation was later passed to extend the interstate to [[San Diego]]. Instead of extending the existing freeway from the I-10 interchange south, however, the [[California Department of Transportation]] drew a new segment in Devore that \"branched\" off of the original alignment and bypassed San Bernardino altogether. This segment's alignment is generally northeast to southwest for about {{convert|13|mi|km|0}}. Then, in [[Rancho Cucamonga, California|Rancho Cucamonga]], its directional alignment shifts to north\u2013south where it eventually meets with Interstate 10 (about {{convert|15|mi|km}} west of the original interchange in San Bernardino). The segment that had been built from Devore to San Bernardino was retained as an interstate, but was re-numbered as [[Interstate 215 (California)|Interstate 215]]. Note that during the construction of I-15's present alignment, and for some time afterwards, I-215 was numbered as I-15E, and its actual mileage would begin at Interstate 10.

It is the main north\u2013south connection for the state. The highway approximately follows the old alignment of [[U.S. Highway 91]] from [[St. George, Utah|St. George]] to [[Brigham City, Utah|Brigham City]]. The highway passes through the fast-growing [[Utah's Dixie]] region in the southwestern part of the state, which includes [[St. George, Utah|St. George]], [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]], and eventually most of the major cities and suburbs along the [[Wasatch Front]], including [[Provo, Utah|Provo]], [[Orem, Utah|Orem]], [[Sandy, Utah|Sandy]], [[Salt Lake City]], [[Layton, Utah|Layton]], and [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]].

Along nearly its entire length through the state, I-15 winds its way along the western edge of a nearly continuous range of mountains (the [[Wasatch Range]] in the northern half of the state). The only exceptions are north of [[Cove Fort, Utah|Cove Fort]] and when it passes between [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]] and St. George, known as the Black Ridge, a transition zone of drastic change in elevation and climate, an area where the eastern [[Great Basin]], [[Colorado Plateau]] and [[Mojave Desert]] converge.\n\n===Idaho===\n{{main|Interstate 15 in Idaho}}\n[[File:I 15 US 20 Junction Sign.jpg|left|thumb|I-15/US-20 Jct. in [[Idaho Falls|Idaho Falls, ID]]]]\nI-15 passes through [[Idaho]] for {{convert|196|mi|km|0}}.

Once Interstate 15 was relatively intact, U.S. 91 was decommissioned, except for one part in Northern Utah/Southern Idaho where Interstate 15 instead followed the route of former [[U.S. Route 191]].\n\nInterstate 15 originally had two suffixed routes. In California, Interstate 15 had an eastern branch bypassing [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], which was designated Interstate 15E. I-15E was renumbered and is now [[Interstate 215 (California)|Interstate 215]]. Present day routing of Interstate 15 in California was originally given \"I-15W\" as its title while it was under construction (the original asphalt portions from Temescal Canyon to Ontario Avenue were dubbed I-15W on maps until 1974), but was never officially signed as such.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-215_ca.html |title = entry for Interstate 215 California |publisher = Interstate-guide.com |date = |accessdate = November 27, 2011 }}</ref> In Idaho, I-15 had a western branch near [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]] that connected I-15 and I-84 (then I-80N).

It is now the [[Interstate 86 (west)|western I-86]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-086_west.html |title = entry for I-86 Western |publisher = Interstate-guide.com |date =  |accessdate = November 27, 2011 |archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6DzWDecj8?url=http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-086_west.html |archive-date = January 27, 2013 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n===Growth along I-15===\nSince the construction of Interstate 15, California, Nevada, and Utah have consistently ranked in the fastest-growing areas of the United States. As a result, the route of I-15 has substantially increased in population and commuter traffic has increased the traffic burden on the freeway.

In Utah, I-15 has been near-constantly upgraded in the [[Wasatch Front]], and future plans released by the [[UDOT|Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT)]] indicate that this will continue in the north ''and'' the far south of the state as well, due to the extremely rapid growth of [[Washington County, Utah|Washington County]] and surrounding areas. In like manner, [[Las Vegas]] in Nevada has seen growth along I-15, and in all of the states that it currently serves, it has recently been or is currently in the process of being upgraded to increase capacity and efficiency.<ref name=udot>{{cite web |url = http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/f?p=100:pg:0:::1:T,V:69, |title = Utah Department of Transportation, Projects Under Construction |accessdate = January 2, 2008 |publisher = Utah Department of Transportation }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nevadadot.com/Projects_and_Programs/Road_Projects/District_1_Construction_Report.aspx |title = District 1 Construction Report |accessdate = January 2, 2008 |publisher = Nevada Department of Transportation |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110527065208/http://www.nevadadot.com/Projects_and_Programs/Road_Projects/District_1_Construction_Report.aspx |archive-date = May 27, 2011 |url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist8/projects/15/I-15%20Brstw%20-STLN.revsd%206-2004%20copy.pdf |title = Interstate 15 Major Improvements |publisher = California Department of Transportation |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070615184246/http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist8/projects/15/I-15%20Brstw%20-STLN.revsd%206-2004%20copy.pdf |archivedate = June 15, 2007 }}</ref> The portions in Arizona, Idaho and Montana have retained their rural, long-haul character.

The [[Las Vegas Monorail]], ''[[FrontRunner]]'' [[Commuter rail in North America|commuter rail]] system and [[TRAX (light rail)|TRAX]] [[light rail]] in [[Salt Lake City]] are mass transit lines loosely parallel to I-15 that are now in operation.

The Governor is appointed by the monarch on the advice of the [[British government]]. The role of the Governor is to act as the ''de facto'' [[head of state]], and he or she is responsible for appointing the [[Premier of Bermuda|Premier]] and the 11 members of the [[Senate of Bermuda|Senate]] (the upper house of [[Parliament of Bermuda|Bermuda's Parliament]]).\n\nThe Governor is also Commander-in-Chief of Bermuda, in control of the [[Royal Bermuda Regiment]] (all that remains of the [[Bermuda Garrison]]). Until 1867, the Governor also held the appointment of Vice-Admiral of Bermuda.\n\nThe current Governor is [[John Rankin (diplomat)|John Rankin]]; he was sworn in on 5 December 2016.\n\nThe Governor has his own flag in Bermuda, a [[Union Flag]] with the [[Coat of Arms of Bermuda|territory's coat of arms]] superimposed.\n\n==History==\nBermuda's settlement began in 1609, with the wrecking of the flagship of the [[London Company|Virginia Company]], the ''[[Sea Venture]]''. Although most of the passengers and crew ultimately completed their voyage to [[Virginia]], the archipelago was permanently settled from that point, and left in the hands of the Virginia Company. The first intentional settlers arrived in 1612, under Richard Moore, whose appointment was officially as the Deputy Governor of Bermuda. Sir Thomas Smith remained in England as the first Governor and Treasurer of Bermuda. A carpenter by trade, Moore ensured the long-term survival of the colony by concentrating on building fortifications, including the [[Castle Islands Fortifications, Bermuda|first stone forts in the English New World]], and developing [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's Town]]. Moore brought with him to Bermuda two consecutively numbered boxes. The first, only to be opened in the case of his death, incapacitation or absence from the colony, contained the name of the settler who was to replace him. In the case of that settler also having died, or otherwise being incapable of taking the office, a second was named in the other box. More was also instructed to appoint a ''Counsell of Six'' to assist in the governance of the colony. The six appointed Counsellors were Captain Miles Kendall, Captain John Mansfield, Thomas Knight, Charles Caldycot, Edward Waters, and Christopher Carter (Carter was among three men who had first arrived in Bermuda with the 1609 wreck of the [[Sea Venture]]. He had remained behind with Robert Waters when the ''Deliverance'' and ''Patience'' had departed for Jamestown in 1610 with the remainder of the Sea Venture's passengers and crew, and remained again with Robert Waters and Edward Chard, after the Patience had returned from Jamestown and departed once more in the same year for England).\n\nBermuda was the second permanent English colony established (as an extension of the first, [[Jamestown, Virginia]]). Bermuda was administered under [[Royal charter]]s by the Virginia Company, and its successor, the [[Somers Isles Company]], which appointed the colony's governors until the Crown revoked the charter and took over administration in 1684. With the transfer to the Somers Isles Company in 1615, Sir Thomas Smith remained in England as Governor and Treasurer of Bermuda, and Captain [[Daniel Tucker (colonial administrator)|Daniel Tucker]] was sent to Bermuda in 1616 aboard the ''George'', in consort with the ''Edwin'', to succeed Moore as Deputy Governor. Twenty-four Assistants were also appointed. By the 1630s, the Somers Isles Company had ceased sending Governors to Bermuda and had begun appointing prominent Bermudians, such as [[William Sayle]], to the position.\n\nThe Crown maintained the system of government established under the company; an elected parliament (originally a single [[House of Assembly]], which held is first session in 1620) which held its and a privy council under a governor. The Privy Council, made up of the Chief Justice, certain senior civil servants, and appointees, was also known as the Governor's Council and the Legislative Council (most of its responsibilities are now filled by the Cabinet and the [[Senate of Bermuda]], with the Council now only an advisory body for the Governor). The last company-appointed Governor was reappointed by the Crown. In 1707 the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British State]] was created by the union of the [[Kingdom of England]] with the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], and Bermuda thereby became a British colony. Since the 1783 independence of Virginia, it has been Britain's oldest colony. Following US independence, Bermuda became an important [[Royal Navy]] base, with a large [[Bermuda Garrison|military garrison]] to guard it.<ref>\"The Andrew and the Onions: The Story of the Royal Navy in Bermuda, 1795\u20131975\", Lt. Commander Ian Strannack, The Bermuda Maritime Museum Press, The Bermuda Maritime Museum</ref> As such, the policy of the government until the closure of the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval dockyard]] in 1953 had been to appoint retiring Generals or Admirals as Bermuda's Governor and Commander-in-Chief. On the rare occasions when a civilian was appointed to the role, it was only as Governor \u2013 the role of Commander-in-Chief being filled by a serving General or Admiral in Bermuda or Newfoundland. Since the 1950s, those appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief have tended to be prominent career-politicians at the ends of their political lives.\n\nPrior to the creation of the lower (and, originally, ''only'') [[House (legislature)|house]] of the [[Parliament of Bermuda]], the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]], in 1620, the Governors ruled supreme, and were often draconian. Governor [[Daniel Tucker (Governor)|Daniel Tucker]], formerly of Virginia, who arrived in 1616, was notorious for his harshness, having many islanders hanged, maimed, or whipped on the slightest provocation. One Bermudian, John Wood, was hanged for airing his views on the Governor in church. Governor Tucker's personal boat was reportedly stolen by five islanders, one named Saunders, who left a note saying they were ''on their way to England, or [[Davy Jones' Locker]], either place being preferable'' to Bermuda under Tucker's rule. On reaching England, they complained about the harshness of Tucker's rule, though their complaints fell on deaf ears. Governor Tucker also, reportedly, used his oversight of the surveying of Bermuda to enrich himself and future generations of Bermudian Tuckers with prime real estate when he appropriated the ''overplus'' (surplus) land left after [[Richard Norwood]]'s 1616 survey of the colony. Much of this land, forming an estate known as ''The Grove'', would still be in the hands of his relatives during the [[American War of Independence]].\n\nFor the remainder of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the real political power in Bermuda lay in the elected parliament and the appointed Council, both dominated by members of Bermuda's wealthy commercial class. By the mid-Seventeenth Century, the Somers Isles Company had ceased sending Governors from overseas, and instead appointed Bermudians such as [[William Sayle]] from this same local elite; a policy which ended after the [[English Civil War|Civil Wars]], during which Bermuda tended to the Royalist side. After the regicide, Bermuda was the first colony to recognize [[King Charles II of England|Charles II]]. With control of \"the Army\" (the local militia), the royalists ousted the [[Somers Isles Company]]'s Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, and elected John Trimingham as their leader. \n\nGovernors who were too high-handed or injudicious in the exercise of their office occasionally fell foul of the local political institutions. Governor Isaac Richier, who arrived in 1691, quickly made himself unpopular with his carousing and criminal behaviour. Bermudian complaints saw him placed in jail, and replaced by Governor Goddard. When Goddard proved worse than Richier, attorney general Samuel Trott had him jailed alongside Richier. The two governors were to be tried before a pair of prominent Bermudians, John Trimmingham and William Butterfield. After Trott called the amateur judges ''bush lawyers'', however, he found himself in St. George's jail alongside the governors. After they confided in him their plan for escape, Trott informed the judges. Richier and Goddard were sent back to England for trial.<ref>\"Bermuda in Three Colours\", Carveth Wells. Robert M. McBride & Company, New York. 1935.</ref>\n\n[[File:Government House, Mount Langton.jpg|thumb|left|Government House, Mount Langton. This became Government House when the colonial capital was moved from [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]] to the [[Hamilton, Bermuda|City of Hamilton]] in 1815, and was replaced with the current building on the same grounds.]]\nAt the written request of [[George Washington]], during the course of the [[American War of Independence]], 100 barrels of gunpowder were stolen from a magazine in St. George's and provided to the American rebels. No one was ever prosecuted in relation to this act of treason. The theft had been the result of a conspiracy involving powerful Bermudians, who were motivated as much by Bermuda's desperate plight, denied her primary trading partner and source of food, as by any favourable sentiments they may have had in regard to either the American colonists or their cause. The chief conspirator was [[Henry Tucker (of The Grove)|Henry Tucker of The Grove]] (the ''overplus'' estate appropriated in 1616 by Governor Daniel Tucker), a Member of the House of Assembly, former Member of the Council, and Militia officer (soon to be promoted to Colonel), who had plotted with [[Benjamin Franklin]] while attending the rebel [[Continental Congress]] as a delegate for Bermuda. Two of his sons served in the rebel Army and were to achieve high office in the post-War US Government. A third son, also named ''Henry Tucker'', was at the time the President of the Council (and later acting Governor on multiple occasions), and married to the daughter of Governor [[George James Bruere]]. Following this, Bermudians and their political institutions were looked at suspiciously by the British Government.\n\n[[File:Governor of Bermuda at Prospect Camp 1902.jpg|thumb|Governor Lt. Gen. Sir Henry LeGuay Geary, KCB (right), at [[Prospect Camp, Bermuda]], on Tuesday, the 11 March, 1902 to decorate three officers with the DSO]]\nWith the buildup of the naval and military bases on the island following American independence, the position of the Governor was enhanced. Despite this, the Governors \u2013 appointed by the Crown \u2013 remained largely dependent on the Bermudian parliament to pass laws and to provide funds. This fact often found Governors pleading in vain for the required acts of parliament or money to carry out policies determined at Government House, or in London. This was particularly noticeable in the Bermudian Parliament's neglect to maintain militia, which (other than during the course of the [[War of 1812|American War of 1812]]), it allowed to become moribund after the build-up of the naval and military base began in 1795.\n\nAttempts to raise militias directly under the control of the Governor, without acts of the local parliament, ultimately failed because the parliament did not provide funds. In the 1860s, it became the policy of the British Government to reduce the costly professional military garrison in Bermuda. As it was not wished to leave the colony, seen more as a naval base, unguarded, this could only be done if the professional soldiers were replaced with part-time [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer]] units. Successive governors were set the task of convincing the Bermudian parliament to raise the required units, but, concerned of being saddled with the cost of maintaining the entire garrison, as well as with the possibility for social disruption that could be caused by raising either racially segregated or integrated units, the Bermudian Parliamentarians simply refused. This state of affairs continued until the [[Secretary of State for War]] found a lever (the [[The Fairmont Hamilton Princess|Princess Hotel]]) to blackmail the Bermuda Parliament with in 1885, which resulted it finally passing acts in 1892 for the creation of militia and volunteer forces (although the units would be entirely funded by the British Government).<ref>\"Defence, Not Defiance: A History of the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps\", Jennifer M. Ingham (now Jennifer M. Hind), {{ISBN|0-9696517-1-6}}. Printed by The Island Press Ltd., Pembroke, Bermuda. Itself using as a source the unique, typescript \"History of The Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps, 1891\u20131933\", held at the Bermuda Library, in Hamilton.</ref> Struggles between the Governor and the Parliament would continue to recur. In 1939, the Governor, General Sir [[Reginald Hildyard]], resigned his post, reportedly because the Bermudian Parliament refused to allow him a motor car (motor vehicles having been banned in Bermuda before the [[First World War]], following a petition signed by numerous Bermudians, and by visitors including [[Woodrow Wilson]]).\n\nOn 10 March 1973, the 121st Governor, [[Richard Sharples]], and his aide-de-camp Captain [[Hugh Sayers]], were assassinated in an attack by a Bermudian black activist named Buck Burrows and an accomplice, Larry Tacklin, who were members of the Black Beret Cadres. Under Bermudian law at the time, premeditated murder was a capital offence, and death sentences were often handed out, though routinely commuted. No death sentence had been carried out since the 1940s. After much debate due to the controversial moral issues raised, the sentence stood despite a 6,000-strong petition from Bermudians to the Queen. Both men were hanged in 1977 for the killings and other murders, sparking riots throughout Bermuda. Buck Burrows explained in his confession that he had killed the Governor to prove that he was not untouchable and that white-dominated politics was fallible. He was also found guilty of murdering the police commissioner, George Duckett, six months earlier on 9 September 1972, and of killing the co-owner and book-keeper of a supermarket called the Shopping Centre, Victor Rego and Mark Doe in April 1973.\n\n==List of Governors of Bermuda==\n[[File:George James Bruere.png|thumb|[[George James Bruere]], in office from 1764 to 1780, the longest-serving of all Bermuda's Governors]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n# 1612\u20131616 Richard Moore (Deputy Governor in Bermuda.

The Governor is appointed by the monarch on the advice of the [[British government]]. The role of the Governor is to act as the ''de facto'' [[head of state]], and he or she is responsible for appointing the [[Premier of Bermuda|Premier]] and the 11 members of the [[Senate of Bermuda|Senate]] (the upper house of [[Parliament of Bermuda|Bermuda's Parliament]]).\n\nThe Governor is also Commander-in-Chief of Bermuda, in control of the [[Royal Bermuda Regiment]] (all that remains of the [[Bermuda Garrison]]). Until 1867, the Governor also held the appointment of Vice-Admiral of Bermuda.\n\nThe current Governor is [[John Rankin (diplomat)|John Rankin]]; he was sworn in on 5 December 2016.\n\nThe Governor has his own flag in Bermuda, a [[Union Flag]] with the [[Coat of Arms of Bermuda|territory's coat of arms]] superimposed.\n\n==History==\nBermuda's settlement began in 1609, with the wrecking of the flagship of the [[London Company|Virginia Company]], the ''[[Sea Venture]]''. Although most of the passengers and crew ultimately completed their voyage to [[Virginia]], the archipelago was permanently settled from that point, and left in the hands of the Virginia Company. The first intentional settlers arrived in 1612, under Richard Moore, whose appointment was officially as the Deputy Governor of Bermuda. Sir Thomas Smith remained in England as the first Governor and Treasurer of Bermuda. A carpenter by trade, Moore ensured the long-term survival of the colony by concentrating on building fortifications, including the [[Castle Islands Fortifications, Bermuda|first stone forts in the English New World]], and developing [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's Town]]. Moore brought with him to Bermuda two consecutively numbered boxes. The first, only to be opened in the case of his death, incapacitation or absence from the colony, contained the name of the settler who was to replace him. In the case of that settler also having died, or otherwise being incapable of taking the office, a second was named in the other box. More was also instructed to appoint a ''Counsell of Six'' to assist in the governance of the colony. The six appointed Counsellors were Captain Miles Kendall, Captain John Mansfield, Thomas Knight, Charles Caldycot, Edward Waters, and Christopher Carter (Carter was among three men who had first arrived in Bermuda with the 1609 wreck of the [[Sea Venture]]. He had remained behind with Robert Waters when the ''Deliverance'' and ''Patience'' had departed for Jamestown in 1610 with the remainder of the Sea Venture's passengers and crew, and remained again with Robert Waters and Edward Chard, after the Patience had returned from Jamestown and departed once more in the same year for England).\n\nBermuda was the second permanent English colony established (as an extension of the first, [[Jamestown, Virginia]]). Bermuda was administered under [[Royal charter]]s by the Virginia Company, and its successor, the [[Somers Isles Company]], which appointed the colony's governors until the Crown revoked the charter and took over administration in 1684. With the transfer to the Somers Isles Company in 1615, Sir Thomas Smith remained in England as Governor and Treasurer of Bermuda, and Captain [[Daniel Tucker (colonial administrator)|Daniel Tucker]] was sent to Bermuda in 1616 aboard the ''George'', in consort with the ''Edwin'', to succeed Moore as Deputy Governor. Twenty-four Assistants were also appointed. By the 1630s, the Somers Isles Company had ceased sending Governors to Bermuda and had begun appointing prominent Bermudians, such as [[William Sayle]], to the position.\n\nThe Crown maintained the system of government established under the company; an elected parliament (originally a single [[House of Assembly]], which held is first session in 1620) which held its and a privy council under a governor. The Privy Council, made up of the Chief Justice, certain senior civil servants, and appointees, was also known as the Governor's Council and the Legislative Council (most of its responsibilities are now filled by the Cabinet and the [[Senate of Bermuda]], with the Council now only an advisory body for the Governor). The last company-appointed Governor was reappointed by the Crown. In 1707 the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British State]] was created by the union of the [[Kingdom of England]] with the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], and Bermuda thereby became a British colony. Since the 1783 independence of Virginia, it has been Britain's oldest colony. Following US independence, Bermuda became an important [[Royal Navy]] base, with a large [[Bermuda Garrison|military garrison]] to guard it.<ref>\"The Andrew and the Onions: The Story of the Royal Navy in Bermuda, 1795\u20131975\", Lt. Commander Ian Strannack, The Bermuda Maritime Museum Press, The Bermuda Maritime Museum</ref> As such, the policy of the government until the closure of the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval dockyard]] in 1953 had been to appoint retiring Generals or Admirals as Bermuda's Governor and Commander-in-Chief. On the rare occasions when a civilian was appointed to the role, it was only as Governor \u2013 the role of Commander-in-Chief being filled by a serving General or Admiral in Bermuda or Newfoundland. Since the 1950s, those appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief have tended to be prominent career-politicians at the ends of their political lives.\n\nPrior to the creation of the lower (and, originally, ''only'') [[House (legislature)|house]] of the [[Parliament of Bermuda]], the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]], in 1620, the Governors ruled supreme, and were often draconian. Governor [[Daniel Tucker (Governor)|Daniel Tucker]], formerly of Virginia, who arrived in 1616, was notorious for his harshness, having many islanders hanged, maimed, or whipped on the slightest provocation. One Bermudian, John Wood, was hanged for airing his views on the Governor in church. Governor Tucker's personal boat was reportedly stolen by five islanders, one named Saunders, who left a note saying they were ''on their way to England, or [[Davy Jones' Locker]], either place being preferable'' to Bermuda under Tucker's rule. On reaching England, they complained about the harshness of Tucker's rule, though their complaints fell on deaf ears. Governor Tucker also, reportedly, used his oversight of the surveying of Bermuda to enrich himself and future generations of Bermudian Tuckers with prime real estate when he appropriated the ''overplus'' (surplus) land left after [[Richard Norwood]]'s 1616 survey of the colony. Much of this land, forming an estate known as ''The Grove'', would still be in the hands of his relatives during the [[American War of Independence]].\n\nFor the remainder of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the real political power in Bermuda lay in the elected parliament and the appointed Council, both dominated by members of Bermuda's wealthy commercial class. By the mid-Seventeenth Century, the Somers Isles Company had ceased sending Governors from overseas, and instead appointed Bermudians such as [[William Sayle]] from this same local elite; a policy which ended after the [[English Civil War|Civil Wars]], during which Bermuda tended to the Royalist side. After the regicide, Bermuda was the first colony to recognize [[King Charles II of England|Charles II]]. With control of \"the Army\" (the local militia), the royalists ousted the [[Somers Isles Company]]'s Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, and elected John Trimingham as their leader. \n\nGovernors who were too high-handed or injudicious in the exercise of their office occasionally fell foul of the local political institutions. Governor Isaac Richier, who arrived in 1691, quickly made himself unpopular with his carousing and criminal behaviour. Bermudian complaints saw him placed in jail, and replaced by Governor Goddard. When Goddard proved worse than Richier, attorney general Samuel Trott had him jailed alongside Richier. The two governors were to be tried before a pair of prominent Bermudians, John Trimmingham and William Butterfield. After Trott called the amateur judges ''bush lawyers'', however, he found himself in St. George's jail alongside the governors. After they confided in him their plan for escape, Trott informed the judges. Richier and Goddard were sent back to England for trial.<ref>\"Bermuda in Three Colours\", Carveth Wells. Robert M. McBride & Company, New York. 1935.</ref>\n\n[[File:Government House, Mount Langton.jpg|thumb|left|Government House, Mount Langton. This became Government House when the colonial capital was moved from [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]] to the [[Hamilton, Bermuda|City of Hamilton]] in 1815, and was replaced with the current building on the same grounds.]]\nAt the written request of [[George Washington]], during the course of the [[American War of Independence]], 100 barrels of gunpowder were stolen from a magazine in St. George's and provided to the American rebels. No one was ever prosecuted in relation to this act of treason. The theft had been the result of a conspiracy involving powerful Bermudians, who were motivated as much by Bermuda's desperate plight, denied her primary trading partner and source of food, as by any favourable sentiments they may have had in regard to either the American colonists or their cause. The chief conspirator was [[Henry Tucker (of The Grove)|Henry Tucker of The Grove]] (the ''overplus'' estate appropriated in 1616 by Governor Daniel Tucker), a Member of the House of Assembly, former Member of the Council, and Militia officer (soon to be promoted to Colonel), who had plotted with [[Benjamin Franklin]] while attending the rebel [[Continental Congress]] as a delegate for Bermuda. Two of his sons served in the rebel Army and were to achieve high office in the post-War US Government. A third son, also named ''Henry Tucker'', was at the time the President of the Council (and later acting Governor on multiple occasions), and married to the daughter of Governor [[George James Bruere]]. Following this, Bermudians and their political institutions were looked at suspiciously by the British Government.\n\n[[File:Governor of Bermuda at Prospect Camp 1902.jpg|thumb|Governor Lt. Gen. Sir Henry LeGuay Geary, KCB (right), at [[Prospect Camp, Bermuda]], on Tuesday, the 11 March, 1902 to decorate three officers with the DSO]]\nWith the buildup of the naval and military bases on the island following American independence, the position of the Governor was enhanced. Despite this, the Governors \u2013 appointed by the Crown \u2013 remained largely dependent on the Bermudian parliament to pass laws and to provide funds. This fact often found Governors pleading in vain for the required acts of parliament or money to carry out policies determined at Government House, or in London. This was particularly noticeable in the Bermudian Parliament's neglect to maintain militia, which (other than during the course of the [[War of 1812|American War of 1812]]), it allowed to become moribund after the build-up of the naval and military base began in 1795.\n\nAttempts to raise militias directly under the control of the Governor, without acts of the local parliament, ultimately failed because the parliament did not provide funds. In the 1860s, it became the policy of the British Government to reduce the costly professional military garrison in Bermuda. As it was not wished to leave the colony, seen more as a naval base, unguarded, this could only be done if the professional soldiers were replaced with part-time [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer]] units. Successive governors were set the task of convincing the Bermudian parliament to raise the required units, but, concerned of being saddled with the cost of maintaining the entire garrison, as well as with the possibility for social disruption that could be caused by raising either racially segregated or integrated units, the Bermudian Parliamentarians simply refused. This state of affairs continued until the [[Secretary of State for War]] found a lever (the [[The Fairmont Hamilton Princess|Princess Hotel]]) to blackmail the Bermuda Parliament with in 1885, which resulted it finally passing acts in 1892 for the creation of militia and volunteer forces (although the units would be entirely funded by the British Government).<ref>\"Defence, Not Defiance: A History of the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps\", Jennifer M. Ingham (now Jennifer M. Hind), {{ISBN|0-9696517-1-6}}. Printed by The Island Press Ltd., Pembroke, Bermuda. Itself using as a source the unique, typescript \"History of The Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps, 1891\u20131933\", held at the Bermuda Library, in Hamilton.</ref> Struggles between the Governor and the Parliament would continue to recur. In 1939, the Governor, General Sir [[Reginald Hildyard]], resigned his post, reportedly because the Bermudian Parliament refused to allow him a motor car (motor vehicles having been banned in Bermuda before the [[First World War]], following a petition signed by numerous Bermudians, and by visitors including [[Woodrow Wilson]]).\n\nOn 10 March 1973, the 121st Governor, [[Richard Sharples]], and his aide-de-camp Captain [[Hugh Sayers]], were assassinated in an attack by a Bermudian black activist named Buck Burrows and an accomplice, Larry Tacklin, who were members of the Black Beret Cadres. Under Bermudian law at the time, premeditated murder was a capital offence, and death sentences were often handed out, though routinely commuted. No death sentence had been carried out since the 1940s. After much debate due to the controversial moral issues raised, the sentence stood despite a 6,000-strong petition from Bermudians to the Queen. Both men were hanged in 1977 for the killings and other murders, sparking riots throughout Bermuda. Buck Burrows explained in his confession that he had killed the Governor to prove that he was not untouchable and that white-dominated politics was fallible. He was also found guilty of murdering the police commissioner, George Duckett, six months earlier on 9 September 1972, and of killing the co-owner and book-keeper of a supermarket called the Shopping Centre, Victor Rego and Mark Doe in April 1973.\n\n==List of Governors of Bermuda==\n[[File:George James Bruere.png|thumb|[[George James Bruere]], in office from 1764 to 1780, the longest-serving of all Bermuda's Governors]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n# 1612\u20131616 Richard Moore (Deputy Governor in Bermuda.
