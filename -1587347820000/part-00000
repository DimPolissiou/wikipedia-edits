In the films, Thanos seeks to collect all six [[Infinity Stones]] in an effort to \"balance\" the universe by stabilizing its overpopulation. The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]] join forces to combat him.\n\nThe overall main [[antagonist]] of the \"Infinity Saga\" of the MCU, Thanos appeared in five films, from his introduction in a post-credit scene in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', up to ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''. The character received praise from critics and fans alike, and in 2018 was described as \"hands down\" the best villain of the MCU.<ref name=\"VillainRank\" />\n\n==Creation and development==\n[[Jim Starlin]] conceived Thanos during a college [[psychology]] course, and he introduced the character in a 1973 edition of ''[[The Invincible Iron Man]]''. Starlin originally designed the character as skinny and lanky, but editor [[Roy Thomas]] suggested he \"beef him up.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview with Jim Starlin |url=http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/starlin.htm |website=Adelaide Comics and Books |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122032717/http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/starlin.htm |archivedate=January 22, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Thanos is a mutant member of the race of superhumans known as the Titanian Eternals. The character possesses abilities common to the Eternals, and is able to demonstrate enormous superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and invulnerability among other qualities.\n\nThe MCU began building towards Thanos in the first ''Avengers'' film, in which [[Damion Poitier]] portrayed the character in an uncredited cameo appearance.{{cn|date=April 2020}} In May 2014, [[Josh Brolin]] signed a multi-film contract to portray the antagonist, debuting in ''Guardians of the Galaxy''. Thanos was originally going to have a larger role in ''Guardians'', but [[Joss Whedon]] felt that the character needed to be threaded more gently.<ref name=\"HitFix\"/> Screenwriters [[Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely]] noted that Thanos' lingering presence in the franchise helped legitimize him as a threat prior to ''Infinity War''. However, little screen time had been devoted to his history and motivations. Markus stated, \"We don't get an element of surprise [with his introduction in ''Infinity War'']... You can count on a lot of scenes where we illuminate a lot about him very early\",<ref name=\"thanoswriters\">{{cite web |last1=Sampson |first1=Mike |title=Avengers: Infinity War Writers Tease Thanos' Big Introduction |url=https://screencrush.com/avengers-infinity-war-thanos-writers/ |website=ScreenCrush |language=en |date=April 12, 2016}}</ref> with McFeely adding, \"It is incumbent upon us to give him a real story, real stakes, real personality, and a real point of view.\"<ref name=\"thanoswriters\"/>\n\n''Avengers: Infinity War'' went through numerous story iterations, and over the course of development Thanos' presence in the film grew. VFX Supervisor Dan Deleeuw noted \"Thanos went from supporting villain to one of the main characters driving the plot.\"<ref name=hollywoodreporter>{{cite web |last1=Giardina |first1=Carolyn |title=How 'Avengers: Infinity War' VFX Teams Brought Josh Brolin's Thanos to Life |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/how-vfx-teams-brought-josh-brolins-thanos-life-infinity-war-1178231 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en |date=January 25, 2019}}</ref> In one draft, the film was told directly from Thanos' perspective with him serving as narrator.<ref>{{cite web |title=Thanos Originally Narrated Avengers: Infinity War |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2462511/thanos-originally-narrated-avengers-infinity-war |website=CinemaBlend |date=November 30, 2018}}</ref> Despite leading the cast in screen time in ''Infinity War''<ref name=\"ScreenTimeIW\" /> and being considered the main character of the film by many, Thanos had a secondary role in ''Endgame''. McFeely explained \"we had to give ourselves permission to backseat the villain [...] You're rolling around in the loss and the time heist, and you think it's sort of Avengers against nature.\"<ref name=\"26Spoilers\" /> Joe Russo stated that after Thanos was successful in ''Avengers: Infinity War'', he is now \"done.

This plot was omitted from the films, as the filmmakers chose to pair the character with Gamora and focus on their father-daughter relationship. McFeely explained this choice  by noting \"[Thanos and Gamora] had a lot of history we wanted to explore\" that would add layers to Thanos and would avoid him becoming \"the big mustache-twisting bad guy who wants ultimate power just to take over the world and sit on a throne\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Buchanan |first1=Kyle |title=Avengers: Infinity War: How They Decided to Split Up the Characters |url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/avengers-infinity-war-how-they-decided-to-group-the-heroes.html |website=Vulture |language=en-us |date=April 30, 2018}}</ref> Avoiding the Death storyline moved away from the tease Whedon used in ''The Avengers'' with the character, where Thanos felt that by challenging the Avengers, he was courting death. Though the tease was purposely ambiguous, Whedon felt when he featured Thanos he did not know what to do with him and \"kind of hung [Thanos] out to dry\". Whedon added that \"I love Thanos. I love his apocalyptic vision, his love affair with death. I love his power. But, I don't really understand it.\" Whedon enjoyed the approach the writers and Russos took in ''Infinity War'', giving Thanos \"an actual perspective and [making] him feel righteous to himself\", since the Death storyline was \"not a concept that will necessarily translate\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Evangelista |first1=Chris |title=Joss Whedon Admits He Didn't Know What to Do With Thanos |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/joss-whedon-thanos/ |website=Slash Film |date=July 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Design and special effects===\nDigital Domain worked on creating Thanos for ''Infinity War'' and ''Endgame'', producing over 400 visual effects shots.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> The company created a new facial capture [[Application software|application]] called Masquerade, based on the concept of [[machine learning]] through computer algorithms, specifically for the film, beginning work on the system 3\u20134 months before filming began to develop and test it. They presented their results to Brolin, the Russos, and executives from Marvel ahead of filming to demonstrate the subtleties Brolin would be able to bring to the character, which helped inform Brolin how to portray the character.<ref name=\"FXGuide\">{{cite web |last1=Seymour |first1=Mike |title=Making Thanos Face the Avengers |url=https://www.fxguide.com/fxfeatured/making-thanos-face-the-avengers/ |website=fxguide |date=May 7, 2018}}</ref> Before the start of filming, Brolin's facial expressions were captured with ILM's Medusa system, which along with his motion capture data from set, were fed to Masquerade to \"create a higher-resolution version of what Brolin did on set\" so animators could apply that to the CGI character. Kelly Port, Digital Domain's VFX Supervisor, noted the design of Thanos took into account the versions that appeared in previous films, but were adjusted more toward's Brolin's features, which also helped with matching his performance to the digital character.<ref name=hollywoodreporter/>\n\n==Marvel Cinematic Universe==\n===Appearances===\n{{further|The Avengers (2012 film)|Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Avengers: Age of Ultron|Avengers: Infinity War|Avengers: Endgame}}\n* Thanos had minor roles in his first few appearances in the MCU, including two post-credit scene cameo appearances in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''<ref name=\"TheAvengers\" /> and ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''<ref name=\"AAoU\" />.\n* In ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''<ref name=\"GotG\" />, Thanos appears in a supporting role. In the film, he tasks [[Kree]] radical [[Ronan the Accuser]] with tracking down the Power Stone on his behalf. Once obtained, Thanos plans to repay Ronan by destroying Xandar. However, Ronan betrays Thanos and keeps the stone for himself, ultimately resulting in his death at the hands of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]].\n* Thanos serves as the primary antagonist of both ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', in which he sets out to collect all six infinity stones.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\n===Early life===\nBorn and raised on the planet Titan, Thanos had an unwavering love for his home and its people. As Titan grew overpopulated and began running low on natural resources, Thanos worried about his planet's lifespan. In an effort to save the planet, Thanos suggested killing half the population at random so that the other half could prosper. The people of Titan rejected this idea and banished Thanos, labeling him a madman. However, Thanos' worries proved valid as Titan crumbled over time and Thanos' race went extinct, leaving him as its sole survivor. Fearing what happened to Titan would occur elsewhere, Thanos dedicated his life to \"balancing\" the universe by destroying half of all life for the benefit of the other half.\n\nThe Mad Titan amassed an army and began conquering planets, causing his reputation to quickly spread throughout the galaxy. To further build his strength, Thanos adopted children that were orphaned during the conquering of their home planet. He ultimately adopted six children; [[Corvus Glaive]], [[Cull Obsidian]], [[Ebony Maw]], [[Proxima Midnight]], [[Nebula]], and [[Gamora]]. During his children's training, Thanos always pit Nebula and Gamora against each other, and Gamora's consistent victories caused her to become Thanos' favorite child. Conversely, he grew disappointed in Nebula, and every time she'd lose he would replace a part of her body with machinery in an effort to improve her fighting.\n\n===Growing interest in the Infinity Stones===\nAs time passed Thanos discovered the most efficient way to bring balance to the universe would be with the use of the Infinity Stones, six all-powerful gems that grant their wielder god-like abilities. Thanos made it his mission to acquire these stones, first by proxy and eventually on his own volition.\nAt the behest of Thanos, The Other, leader of the Chitauri, tasked [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] with collecting the Space Stone, located within the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]]. In exchange for the stone, Thanos and The Other agree to give Loki an army of Chitauri. However, the Avengers apprehend Loki, and [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] takes the Tesseract to [[Asgard]] for safe keeping. Thanos then turns his attention to the Power Stone, which is inside an Orb on the planet Morag. Thanos strikes a bargain with [[Kree]] radical [[Ronan the Accuser]] similar to his deal with Loki; in exchange for the Orb, Thanos will grant Ronan an army with which he can destroy the planet [[Xandar]]. Before Ronan can get the Orb it is captured by [[Peter Quill]], leading Thanos to task Gamora with re-claiming it. Unbeknownst to them, Gamora had been planning to betray them by turning the stone over to [[The Collector]]. When Ronan relays the news of Gamora's betrayal, Thanos scolds him for his disrespect and blames him for \"alienating [his] favorite daughter.\" He then assigns Nebula to take Gamora's place at Ronan's side.\n\nMeanwhile, Gamora and Quill join forces alongside [[Rocket Raccoon]], [[Groot]], and [[Drax the Destroyer]] to form the Guardians of the Galaxy. The group decides to take the Power Stone to the [[Nova Corps]] on Xandar for safe keeping, but before they can Ronan and his forces take it from them. When Thanos contacts Ronan for an update, he discovers that Ronan, having experienced the true capability of the Power Stone, intends to keep it for himself, and Nebula sides with him over her adopted father. Unphased, Thanos cuts contact with them without a word. Ronan is eventually killed by the Guardians of the Galaxy, who then give the Power Stone to the Nova Corps, leaving another stone lost to Thanos.\n\n===Assembling the stones===\nAfter both Loki and Ronan failed, Thanos decides to assemble the Infinity Stones himself. He begins by traveling to Nidavellir, a planet of blacksmith Dwarves, and forcing them to build him a gauntlet capable of channeling all six Infinity Stones. Once they had done so, Thanos proceeded to exterminate the entire population save [[Eitri]], who's hands Thanos smelted in metal. With the [[Infinity Gauntlet]] now in hand, Thanos seeks out the Stones.\n\nHe begins on Xandar, using his army to decimate the planet, claim the Power Stone from the Nova Corps, and kill half of all Xandarians. Next, he uses his ship, the Sanctuary II, to track down the starship carrying the Asgardian survivors of the [[Thor: Ragnarok|Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Thanos and his remaining children, collectively known as the [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]], board the ship and kill half the remaining Asgardians. In the aftermath of the slaughter, Thanos personally defeats the [[Hulk]] in hand-to-combat and kills Heimdall. He takes the Space Stone from Loki and kills him, the leaves Thor to die.\n\nThanos orders his children to retrieve the Time and Mind Stones from Earth while he heads to Knowhere to get the Reality Stone from the Collector. Quill, Gamora, Drax and [[Mantis (comics)|Mantis]] attempt to stop him, but Thanos foils them via his newly acquired Reality Stone. Aware that Gamora knows the location of Soul Stone, he captures her and takes her aboard the Sanctuary II. There, Thanos reveals he has captured Nebula; she had snuck aboard his ship to assassinate him but failed. Thanos tortures Nebula until Gamora reveals the location of the Soul Stone, Vormir. He and Gamora travel to Vormir, and while they are gone Nebula escapes the ship. On Vormir, Thanos and Gamora encounter [[Red Skull]], keeper of the Soul Stone. Red Skull tells Thanos that the only way to acquire the Soul Stone is to sacrifice someone you love. Upon hearing this Gamora mocked Thanos, claiming he loves nothing. However, Thanos truly loved Gamora as his daughter, and unwilling to give up his quest for balance, he makes the sacrifice; he hurls Gamora off a cliff, killing her and granting him the Soul Stone.\n\nThanos returns to Titan to rendezvous with Ebony Maw, only to discover that Maw is dead and [[Doctor Strange]] awaits him. After detailing the extinction of his home planet, Thanos explains to Strange that with all six stones he will simply snap his fingers and half of all life in the universe would cease to exist. Thanos considers this mercy, and once the task is completed he will rest and watch the sunrise on a \"grateful\" universe. To prevent this, Strange engages Thanos along with [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]], [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]], Quill, Drax and Mantis, with Nebula later joining the fight. The heroes are able to overpower Thanos and Mantis puts him to sleep, allowing them access to the Gauntlet. But upon learning of Gamora's death, Quill is unable to control his emotions and attacks Thanos, causing Mantis to lose her grip on the Mad Titan. Freed from the trance, Thanos brutally attacks the group, defeating them one by one until only Stark remained. Despite his insistence that the Time Stone took precedent over any of the Avengers' lives, Doctor Strange agrees to give Thanos the Time Stone if he spares Stark's life. With five of the six Stones claimed, Thanos heads to Wakanda to collect the Mind Stone.\n\nIn Wakanda, [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] has been leading a defense against the Black Order and Thanos' army to prevent them from getting the Mind Stone located in [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]'s head. Thanos arrives in Wakanda, and his nearly completed Gauntlet allows him to effortlessly defeats Rogers and his allies. To prevent him from retrieving the final stone, [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] is forced to destroy Vision to eliminate the stone. Thanos takes pity on Wanda, but nevertheless uses the Time Stone to undo Vision's destruction and rip the Mind Stone out of his head, completing the Infinity Gauntlet.\n\n===The Snap===\nAs the power of the Infinity Stones surges through Thanos' body, [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] makes one last charge at him, stabbing him in the chest with [[Stormbreaker]]. Although Thanos appears to be mortally wounded, he survives the attack and jeers Thor, stating he \"should've gone for the head.\" Thanos then snaps his fingers and the Infinity Stones grant him his desire; half of all life in the universe disintegrates without warning.\nAmidst the ensuing chaos, Thanos uses the Space Stone to transport to an uninhabited farming planet called the Garden. There he watches the sunrise, satisfied in having completed his objective.\n\n===Aftermath and undoing===\nThree weeks after the snap, a faction of the surviving Avengers pinpoint Thanos' location. The Avengers arrive at the Garden and attack him. They find the gauntlet fused to his hand, and he reveals that he used the stones to destroy the stones themselves, preventing anyone from reversing his actions. Enraged, Thor decapitates Thanos.\n\nFive years later, [[Scott Lang]] escapes the Quantum Realm. Theorizing that the Quantum Realm could be used for [[time travel]], Lang, Rodgers and [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] ask Stark to help them go back in time, retrieve the stones, and reverse the damage Thanos has done. After initially refusing, Stark relents and helps the surviving Avengers, including Nebula. She and [[War Machine]] travel to Morag in 2014 to capture the Power Stone. Although the pair successfully get the stone, Nebula's cybernetics begin to overlap with her 2014 counterpart. This Nebula's malfunctions are witnessed by the Thanos of 2014, and he exploits it deduce the Avengers' plan to undo his future success.\n\nThanos captures future-Nebula and sends 2014 Nebula to the future so that she can transport him and his army there. She does so, and Thanos arrives just as Banner uses the gathered stones to restore those who were decimated. After his warship fires on the Avengers compound, Thanos tells Stark, Rodgers, and Thor that he now realizes destroying half of all life isn't good enough. Now Thanos plans to use the stones to destroy the entire universe and remake it in his image. The three attack Thanos, but he overpowers them. Before Thanos can finish them off, the recently revived [[Stephen Strange]] arrives with other sorcerers, the restored Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, the Ravagers, and the armies of Wakanda and Asgard to fight Thanos and his army.\n\nThe Avengers fight to prevent Thanos from getting the gauntlet, and [[Carol Danvers]] is able to destroy his warship. However, Thanos overpowers her and seizes the gauntlet. Thanos once again snaps his fingers, but he is shocked to discover that Stark stole the stones from him. Stark snaps his fingers, disintegrating the army and wiping out Thanos once and for all.\n\n==Reception==\nThe MCU's rendition of Thanos has received critical acclaim.

[[character (arts)|character]] portrayed by [[Josh Brolin]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[film franchise]], based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character of the [[Thanos|same name]]. In the films, Thanos seeks to collect all six [[Infinity Stones]] in an effort to \"balance\" the universe by stabilizing its overpopulation. The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]] join forces to combat him. \n\nThe overall main [[antagonist]] of the \"Infinity Saga\" of the MCU, Thanos appeared in five films, from his introduction in a post-credit scene in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', up to ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''. The character received praise from critics and fans alike, and in 2018 was described as \"hands down\" the best villain of the MCU.<ref name=\"VillainRank\" />\n\n==Creation and development==\n[[Jim Starlin]] conceived Thanos during a college [[psychology]] course, and he introduced the character in a 1973 edition of ''[[The Invincible Iron Man]]''. Starlin originally designed the character as skinny and lanky, but editor [[Roy Thomas]] suggested he \"beef him up.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview with Jim Starlin |url=http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/starlin.htm |website=Adelaide Comics and Books |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122032717/http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/starlin.htm |archivedate=January 22, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Thanos is a mutant member of the race of superhumans known as the Titanian Eternals. The character possesses abilities common to the Eternals, and is able to demonstrate enormous superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and invulnerability among other qualities.\n\nThe MCU began building towards Thanos in the first ''Avengers'' film, in which [[Damion Poitier]] portrayed the character in an uncredited cameo appearance.{{cn|date=April 2020}} In May 2014, [[Josh Brolin]] signed a multi-film contract to portray the antagonist, debuting in ''Guardians of the Galaxy''. Thanos was originally going to have a larger role in ''Guardians'', but [[Joss Whedon]] felt that the character needed to be threaded more gently.<ref name=\"HitFix\"/> Screenwriters [[Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely]] noted that Thanos' lingering presence in the franchise helped legitimize him as a threat prior to ''Infinity War''. However, little screen time had been devoted to his history and motivations. Markus stated, \"We don't get an element of surprise [with his introduction in ''Infinity War'']... You can count on a lot of scenes where we illuminate a lot about him very early\",<ref name=\"thanoswriters\">{{cite web |last1=Sampson |first1=Mike |title=Avengers: Infinity War Writers Tease Thanos' Big Introduction |url=https://screencrush.com/avengers-infinity-war-thanos-writers/ |website=ScreenCrush |language=en |date=April 12, 2016}}</ref> with McFeely adding, \"It is incumbent upon us to give him a real story, real stakes, real personality, and a real point of view.\"<ref name=\"thanoswriters\"/>\n\n''Avengers: Infinity War'' went through numerous story iterations, and over the course of development Thanos' presence in the film grew. VFX Supervisor Dan Deleeuw noted \"Thanos went from supporting villain to one of the main characters driving the plot.\"<ref name=hollywoodreporter>{{cite web |last1=Giardina |first1=Carolyn |title=How 'Avengers: Infinity War' VFX Teams Brought Josh Brolin's Thanos to Life |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/how-vfx-teams-brought-josh-brolins-thanos-life-infinity-war-1178231 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en |date=January 25, 2019}}</ref> In one draft, the film was told directly from Thanos' perspective with him serving as narrator.<ref>{{cite web |title=Thanos Originally Narrated Avengers: Infinity War |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2462511/thanos-originally-narrated-avengers-infinity-war |website=CinemaBlend |date=November 30, 2018}}</ref> Despite leading the cast in screen time in ''Infinity War''<ref name=\"ScreenTimeIW\" /> and being considered the main character of the film by many, Thanos had a secondary role in ''Endgame''. McFeely explained \"we had to give ourselves permission to backseat the villain [...] You're rolling around in the loss and the time heist, and you think it's sort of Avengers against nature.\"<ref name=\"26Spoilers\" /> Joe Russo stated that after Thanos was successful in ''Avengers: Infinity War'', he is now \"done. He did it. He's retired.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Swann |first1=Erik |title=Thanos is retired in Avengers: Endgame |url=https://bamsmackpow.com/2018/12/22/thanos-retired-avengers-endgame/ |website=Bam Smack Pow |date=December 22, 2018}}</ref> Markus and McFeely had difficulty in factoring the older, post-''Infinity War'', Thanos into the film due to the character already possessing the Infinity Stones, until executive producer Trinh Tran suggested that they kill Thanos in the film's first act.<ref name=\"NYMarkusMcFeely\" /> Markus explained that the character's early death \"reinforced Thanos's agenda. He was done . . . it was like, 'If I've got to die, I can die now.'\"<ref name=\"NYMarkusMcFeely\">{{cite web |last1=Itzkoff |first1=Dave |title='Avengers: Endgame': The Screenwriters Answer Every Question You Might Have |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/movies/avengers-endgame-questions-and-answers.html |website=The New York Times |date=April 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA major aspect of Thanos' comic book storyline is his attempts to woo the female manifestation of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]]. This plot was omitted from the films, as the filmmakers chose to pair the character with Gamora and focus on their father-daughter relationship. McFeely explained this choice  by noting \"[Thanos and Gamora] had a lot of history we wanted to explore\" that would add layers to Thanos and would avoid him becoming \"the big mustache-twisting bad guy who wants ultimate power just to take over the world and sit on a throne\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Buchanan |first1=Kyle |title=Avengers: Infinity War: How They Decided to Split Up the Characters |url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/avengers-infinity-war-how-they-decided-to-group-the-heroes.html |website=Vulture |language=en-us |date=April 30, 2018}}</ref> Avoiding the Death storyline moved away from the tease Whedon used in ''The Avengers'' with the character, where Thanos felt that by challenging the Avengers, he was courting death. Though the tease was purposely ambiguous, Whedon felt when he featured Thanos he did not know what to do with him and \"kind of hung [Thanos] out to dry\". Whedon added that \"I love Thanos. I love his apocalyptic vision, his love affair with death. I love his power. But, I don't really understand it.\" Whedon enjoyed the approach the writers and Russos took in ''Infinity War'', giving Thanos \"an actual perspective and [making] him feel righteous to himself\", since the Death storyline was \"not a concept that will necessarily translate\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Evangelista |first1=Chris |title=Joss Whedon Admits He Didn't Know What to Do With Thanos |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/joss-whedon-thanos/ |website=Slash Film |date=July 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Design and special effects===\nDigital Domain worked on creating Thanos for ''Infinity War'' and ''Endgame'', producing over 400 visual effects shots.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> The company created a new facial capture [[Application software|application]] called Masquerade, based on the concept of [[machine learning]] through computer algorithms, specifically for the film, beginning work on the system 3\u20134 months before filming began to develop and test it. They presented their results to Brolin, the Russos, and executives from Marvel ahead of filming to demonstrate the subtleties Brolin would be able to bring to the character, which helped inform Brolin how to portray the character.<ref name=\"FXGuide\">{{cite web |last1=Seymour |first1=Mike |title=Making Thanos Face the Avengers |url=https://www.fxguide.com/fxfeatured/making-thanos-face-the-avengers/ |website=fxguide |date=May 7, 2018}}</ref> Before the start of filming, Brolin's facial expressions were captured with ILM's Medusa system, which along with his motion capture data from set, were fed to Masquerade to \"create a higher-resolution version of what Brolin did on set\" so animators could apply that to the CGI character. Kelly Port, Digital Domain's VFX Supervisor, noted the design of Thanos took into account the versions that appeared in previous films, but were adjusted more toward's Brolin's features, which also helped with matching his performance to the digital character.<ref name=hollywoodreporter/>\n\n==Marvel Cinematic Universe==\n===Appearances===\n{{further|The Avengers (2012 film)|Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Avengers: Age of Ultron|Avengers: Infinity War|Avengers: Endgame}}\n\n*Thanos had minor roles in his first few appearances in the MCU, including two post-credit scene cameo appearances in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''<ref name=\"TheAvengers\" /> and ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''<ref name=\"AAoU\" />. \n*In ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''<ref name=\"GotG\" />, Thanos appears in a supporting role. In the film, he tasks [[Kree]] radical [[Ronan the Accuser]] with tracking down the Power Stone on his behalf. Once obtained, Thanos plans to repay Ronan by destroying Xandar. However, Ronan betrays Thanos and keeps the stone for himself, ultimately resulting in his death at the hands of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]].\n*Thanos serves as the primary antagonist of both ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', in which he sets out to collect all six infinity stones.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\n===Early life===\nBorn and raised on the planet Titan, Thanos had an unwavering love for his home and its people. As Titan grew overpopulated and began running low on natural resources, Thanos worried about his planet's lifespan. In an effort to save the planet, Thanos suggested killing half the population at random so that the other half could prosper. The people of Titan rejected this idea and banished Thanos, labeling him a madman. However, Thanos' worries proved valid as Titan crumbled over time and Thanos' race went extinct, leaving him as its sole survivor. Fearing what happened to Titan would occur elsewhere, Thanos dedicated his life to \"balancing\" the universe by destroying half of all life for the benefit of the other half. \n\nThe Mad Titan amassed an army and began conquering planets, causing his reputation to quickly spread throughout the galaxy. To further build his strength, Thanos adopted children that were orphaned during the conquering of their home planet. He ultimately adopted six children; [[Corvus Glaive]], [[Cull Obsidian]], [[Ebony Maw]], [[Proxima Midnight]], [[Nebula]], and [[Gamora]]. During his children's training, Thanos always pit Nebula and Gamora against each other, and Gamora's consistent victories caused her to become Thanos' favorite child. Conversely, he grew disappointed in Nebula, and every time she'd lose he would replace a part of her body with machinery in an effort to improve her fighting.\n\n===Growing interest in the Infinity Stones===\nAs time passed Thanos discovered the most efficient way to bring balance to the universe would be with the use of the Infinity Stones, six all-powerful gems that grant their wielder god-like abilities. Thanos made it his mission to acquire these stones, first by proxy and eventually on his own volition. \nAt the behest of Thanos, The Other, leader of the Chitauri, tasked [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] with collecting the Space Stone, located within the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]]. In exchange for the stone, Thanos and The Other agree to give Loki an army of Chitauri. However, the Avengers apprehend Loki, and [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] takes the Tesseract to [[Asgard]] for safe keeping. Thanos then turns his attention to the Power Stone, which is inside an Orb on the planet Morag. Thanos strikes a bargain with [[Kree]] radical [[Ronan the Accuser]] similar to his deal with Loki; in exchange for the Orb, Thanos will grant Ronan an army with which he can destroy the planet [[Xandar]]. Before Ronan can get the Orb it is captured by [[Peter Quill]], leading Thanos to task Gamora with re-claiming it. Unbeknownst to them, Gamora had been planning to betray them by turning the stone over to [[The Collector]]. When Ronan relays the news of Gamora's betrayal, Thanos scolds him for his disrespect and blames him for \"alienating [his] favorite daughter.\" He then assigns Nebula to take Gamora's place at Ronan's side.\n\nMeanwhile, Gamora and Quill join forces alongside [[Rocket Raccoon]], [[Groot]], and [[Drax the Destroyer]] to form the Guardians of the Galaxy. The group decides to take the Power Stone to the [[Nova Corps]] on Xandar for safe keeping, but before they can Ronan and his forces take it from them. When Thanos contacts Ronan for an update, he discovers that Ronan, having experienced the true capability of the Power Stone, intends to keep it for himself, and Nebula sides with him over her adopted father. Unphased, Thanos cuts contact with them without a word. Ronan is eventually killed by the Guardians of the Galaxy, who then give the Power Stone to the Nova Corps, leaving another stone lost to Thanos.\n\n===Assembling the stones===\nAfter both Loki and Ronan failed, Thanos decides to assemble the Infinity Stones himself. He begins by traveling to Nidavellir, a planet of blacksmith Dwarves, and forcing them to build him a gauntlet capable of channeling all six Infinity Stones. Once they had done so, Thanos proceeded to exterminate the entire population save [[Eitri]], who's hands Thanos smelted in metal. With the [[Infinity Gauntlet]] now in hand, Thanos seeks out the Stones.\n\nHe begins on Xandar, using his army to decimate the planet, claim the Power Stone from the Nova Corps, and kill half of all Xandarians. Next, he uses his ship, the Sanctuary II, to track down the starship carrying the Asgardian survivors of the [[Thor: Ragnarok|Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Thanos and his remaining children, collectively known as the [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]], board the ship and kill half the remaining Asgardians. In the aftermath of the slaughter, Thanos personally defeats the [[Hulk]] in hand-to-combat and kills Heimdall. He takes the Space Stone from Loki and kills him, the leaves Thor to die. \n\nThanos orders his children to retrieve the Time and Mind Stones from Earth while he heads to Knowhere to get the Reality Stone from the Collector. Quill, Gamora, Drax and [[Mantis (comics)|Mantis]] attempt to stop him, but Thanos foils them via his newly acquired Reality Stone. Aware that Gamora knows the location of Soul Stone, he captures her and takes her aboard the Sanctuary II. There, Thanos reveals he has captured Nebula; she had snuck aboard his ship to assassinate him but failed. Thanos tortures Nebula until Gamora reveals the location of the Soul Stone, Vormir. He and Gamora travel to Vormir, and while they are gone Nebula escapes the ship. On Vormir, Thanos and Gamora encounter [[Red Skull]], keeper of the Soul Stone. Red Skull tells Thanos that the only way to acquire the Soul Stone is to sacrifice someone you love. Upon hearing this Gamora mocked Thanos, claiming he loves nothing. However, Thanos truly loved Gamora as his daughter, and unwilling to give up his quest for balance, he makes the sacrifice; he hurls Gamora off a cliff, killing her and granting him the Soul Stone.\n\nThanos returns to Titan to rendezvous with Ebony Maw, only to discover that Maw is dead and [[Doctor Strange]] awaits him. After detailing the extinction of his home planet, Thanos explains to Strange that with all six stones he will simply snap his fingers and half of all life in the universe would cease to exist. Thanos considers this mercy, and once the task is completed he will rest and watch the sunrise on a \"grateful\" universe. To prevent this, Strange engages Thanos along with [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]], [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]], Quill, Drax and Mantis, with Nebula later joining the fight. The heroes are able to overpower Thanos and Mantis puts him to sleep, allowing them access to the Gauntlet. But upon learning of Gamora's death, Quill is unable to control his emotions and attacks Thanos, causing Mantis to lose her grip on the Mad Titan. Freed from the trance, Thanos brutally attacks the group, defeating them one by one until only Stark remained. Despite his insistence that the Time Stone took precedent over any of the Avengers' lives, Doctor Strange agrees to give Thanos the Time Stone if he spares Stark's life. With five of the six Stones claimed, Thanos heads to Wakanda to collect the Mind Stone.\n\nIn Wakanda, [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] has been leading a defense against the Black Order and Thanos' army to prevent them from getting the Mind Stone located in [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]'s head. Thanos arrives in Wakanda, and his nearly completed Gauntlet allows him to effortlessly defeats Rogers and his allies. To prevent him from retrieving the final stone, [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] is forced to destroy Vision to eliminate the stone. Thanos takes pity on Wanda, but nevertheless uses the Time Stone to undo Vision's destruction and rip the Mind Stone out of his head, completing the Infinity Gauntlet.\n\n===The Snap===\nAs the power of the Infinity Stones surges through Thanos' body, [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] makes one last charge at him, stabbing him in the chest with [[Stormbreaker]]. Although Thanos appears to be mortally wounded, he survives the attack and jeers Thor, stating he \"should've gone for the head.\" Thanos then snaps his fingers and the Infinity Stones grant him his desire; half of all life in the universe disintegrates without warning.\nAmidst the ensuing chaos, Thanos uses the Space Stone to transport to an uninhabited farming planet called the Garden. There he watches the sunrise, satisfied in having completed his objective. \n\n===Aftermath and undoing===\nThree weeks after the snap, a faction of the surviving Avengers pinpoint Thanos' location. The Avengers arrive at the Garden and attack him. They find the gauntlet fused to his hand, and he reveals that he used the stones to destroy the stones themselves, preventing anyone from reversing his actions. Enraged, Thor decapitates Thanos.\n\nFive years later, [[Scott Lang]] escapes the Quantum Realm. Theorizing that the Quantum Realm could be used for [[time travel]], Lang, Rodgers and [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] ask Stark to help them go back in time, retrieve the stones, and reverse the damage Thanos has done. After initially refusing, Stark relents and helps the surviving Avengers, including Nebula. She and [[War Machine]] travel to Morag in 2014 to capture the Power Stone. Although the pair successfully get the stone, Nebula's cybernetics begin to overlap with her 2014 counterpart. This Nebula's malfunctions are witnessed by the Thanos of 2014, and he exploits it deduce the Avengers' plan to undo his future success. \n\nThanos captures future-Nebula and sends 2014 Nebula to the future so that she can transport him and his army there. She does so, and Thanos arrives just as Banner uses the gathered stones to restore those who were decimated. After his warship fires on the Avengers compound, Thanos tells Stark, Rodgers, and Thor that he now realizes destroying half of all life isn't good enough. Now Thanos plans to use the stones to destroy the entire universe and remake it in his image. The three attack Thanos, but he overpowers them. Before Thanos can finish them off, the recently revived [[Stephen Strange]] arrives with other sorcerers, the restored Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, the Ravagers, and the armies of Wakanda and Asgard to fight Thanos and his army. \n\nThe Avengers fight to prevent Thanos from getting the gauntlet, and [[Carol Danvers]] is able to destroy his warship. However, Thanos overpowers her and seizes the gauntlet. Thanos once again snaps his fingers, but he is shocked to discover that Stark stole the stones from him. Stark snaps his fingers, disintegrating the army and wiping out Thanos once and for all.\n\n==Reception==\nThe MCU's rendition of Thanos has received critical acclaim. [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called Brolin's performance \"supremely effective\" and said, \"Brolin infuses Thanos with his slit-eyed manipulative glower, so that the evil in this movie never feels less than personal\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gleiberman |first1=Owen |title=Film Review: 'Avengers: Infinity War' |url=https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/avengers-infinity-war-review-robert-downey-jr-chadwick-boseman-1202782256/ |website=Variety |language=en |date=April 24, 2018}}</ref> [[Todd McCarthy]] echoed this sentiment, saying \"Brolin's calm, considered reading of the character bestows this conquering beast with an unexpectedly resonant emotional dimension, making him much more than a thick stick figure of a supervillain\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=McCarthy |first1=Todd |title='Avengers: Infinity War': Film Review |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/avengers-infinity-war-review-1105484 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en |date=April 24, 2018}}</ref> Writing for ''[[IGN]]'', Scott Collua pointed out that audiences \"understand his perspective and believe his pain\", making the antagonist surprisingly sympathetic.<ref name=\"ignreview\">{{cite web |last1=Collura |first1=Scott |title=Avengers: Infinity War Review - IGN |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/18/avengers-infinity-war-review |website=IGN |date=May 18, 2018}}</ref> [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' praised both the character and Brolin: \"[Thanos is] thunderously voiced by a dynamite Josh Brolin in a motion-capture performance that radiates ferocity and unexpected feeling.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Travers |first1=Peter |title=Travers on 'Avengers: Infinity War': Marvel Team-Up Is Superhero Pile-Up |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-reviews/avengers-infinity-war-review-all-star-marvel-team-up-is-superhero-pile-up-628954/ |website=Rolling Stone |date=April 24, 2018}}</ref> ''[[The Atlantic]]'' called Thanos an \"unexpectedly resonant monster, filled with sadness and even a perverse sense of honor.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Orr |first1=Christopher |title='Avengers: Infinity War' Is an Extraordinary Juggling Act |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/04/avengers-infinity-war-marvel-review/558983/ |website=The Atlantic |date=April 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\nCritics noted that Thanos was a significant improvement over previous antagonists in the franchise.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Guerrasio |first1=Jason |title=Thanks to Thanos, 'Avengers: Infinity War' is Marvel's 'The Empire Strikes Back' |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/avengers-infinity-war-is-marvel-empire-strikes-back-because-of-thanos-2018-4 |website=Business Insider |date=April 30, 2018}}</ref> According to ''[[Screen Rant]]'', the MCU struggled to create captivating antagonists throughout its first two phases. However, this changed in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|phase three]] with well-received villains such as [[Black Panther (film)|Killmonger]] and [[Spider-Man: Homecoming|Vulture]], culminating in Thanos, who's \"repudiation of the MCU's narrative worship of its heroes creates a deep uncertainty in our expectation that follows through each encounter toward the inevitable, horrifying conclusion.\"<ref name=\"VillainRank\" /> George Marston attributed Thanos' success to \"the weight behind his character. Like the best villains in media, Thanos sees himself as a hero. It\u2019s the power of Brolin\u2019s performance that begins to draw viewers into that maniacal goal over and over, almost making Thanos seem likable or perhaps even reasonable, before the utter horror of him actually accomplishing his goal kicks in.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Ranking All The Marvel Studios Villains From Worst-To-Best |url=https://www.newsarama.com/38948-ranking-all-23-marvel-studios-villains-from-worst-to-best.html#s29 |website=Newsarama |language=en |date=January 13, 2020}}</ref> Similarly, ''[[the Washington Post]]'' declared Thanos Marvel's most compelling villain due to his \"deep, reflective intelligence\" as well as his \"profound adherence to his belief system\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cavna |first1=Michael |title=Here's why 'Infinity War's' Thanos is the most compelling Marvel film villain yet |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2018/05/04/heres-why-infinity-wars-thanos-is-the-most-compelling-marvel-film-villain-yet/ |website=Washington Post |language=en |date=May 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Cultural impact===\nThanos and his snap spawned much audience enthusiasm. The website, ''DidThanosKill.Me'' was created for fans to see if they would have been spared by Thanos or not.<ref>{{cite web |title=Did Thanos Kill You? |url=http://www.didthanoskill.me/ |website=didthanoskill.me}}</ref> The ending also spawned the creation of the [[Reddit]] subreddit, /r/thanosdidnothingwrong. A user within the subreddit suggested that half of the approximately 20,000 subscribers at the time be banned from the subreddit, in order to mimic the events of the film. After the community agreed to the measure, the moderators approached Reddit's administrators to see if the mass ban would even be possible.

He was the youngest living artist to have work purchased by the Tate, a record that still stands.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|loc={{Page missing|date=July 2018}}}} In 1962, Whiteley married [[Wendy Whiteley|Wendy Julius]]. Their only child, daughter [[Arkie Whiteley]], was born in London in 1964. While in London, Whiteley painted works in several different series: bathing, the zoo and the [[John Christie (murderer)|Christies]]. His paintings during these years were influenced by the modernist British art of the sixties \u2013 particularly the works of [[William Scott (artist)|William Scott]] and [[Roger Hilton]] \u2013 and were of brownish abstract forms. It was these abstract works which led to him being recognised as an artist, at a time when many other Australian artists were exhibiting in London, but from 1963 he moved away from abstraction towards figuration. His farewell to abstraction, ''Summer at Sigean'', was a record of his honeymoon in France.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|loc={{Page missing|date=July 2018}}}} He painted ''Woman in bath'' (1963)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/191.2000/|title=Woman in bath|last=Whiteley|first=Brett|year=1963|website=AGNSW collection record|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|access-date=12 April 2016}}</ref> as part of a series of works he was doing of bathroom pictures. It has primarily black on one side and has an image of his wife Wendy in a bathtub, seen from behind. Another in the series was a more abstracted ''Woman in the bath II'', which owed a debt to his yellow and red abstract paintings of the early sixties.\n\nIn 1964, while in London, Whiteley became fascinated by the murderer [[John Christie (murderer)|John Christie]], who had committed murders in the area near where Whiteley was staying in Ladbroke Grove. He painted a series of paintings based on these events, including ''Head of Christie''. Whiteley's intention was to portray the violence of the events, but not to go too far in showing something which people would not want to see. During this time, Whiteley also painted works based on the animals at the London Zoo, such as ''Two Indonesian giraffes'', which he found sometimes difficult. As he said: \"To draw animals, one has to work at white heat because they move so much, and partly because it is sometimes painful to feel what one guesses the animal 'feels' from inside.\" (Whiteley 1979: 1) Whiteley also made images of the beach, such as his yellowish painting and collage work ''The beach II'', which he painted on a brief visit to Australia before his return to London and his winning of a fellowship to America.\nWhiteley appears as a character in the book ''Falling Towards England'' by [[Clive James]] under the name Dibbs Buckley. His wife Wendy appears as \"Delish\".{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\n==New York==\nIn 1967 Whiteley won a [[Harkness Fellowship]] Scholarship to study and work in New York. He met other artists and musicians while he lived at the [[Hotel Chelsea]], where he befriended musicians [[Janis Joplin]] and [[Bob Dylan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/artists/whiteley-brett/|title=Brett Whiteley|website=AGNSW collection record|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|access-date=12 April 2016}}</ref> His first impression of New York was shown in the painting ''First sensation of New York City'', which showed streets with fast moving vehicles, street signs, hot dog vendors, and tall buildings. The Hotel Chelsea displayed several of Whiteley's paintings from the time he lived there, including ''Portrait of New York'' which was hung behind the reception desk.<ref>White, J. [http://www.artcollector.net.au/files/files/Artist%20profiles/Issue%205/Issue5_Jul1998_whiteley.pdf Collectors Dossier] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929095402/http://www.artcollector.net.au/files/files/Artist%20profiles/Issue%205/Issue5_Jul1998_whiteley.pdf |date=29 September 2009 }}, ''Australian Art Collector'', July 1998</ref>\n\nOne way that America influenced him is in the scale of his works. He was very much influenced by the [[peace movement]] at the time and came to believe that if he painted one huge painting which would advocate peace, then the Americans would withdraw their troops from [[Vietnam]]. Whiteley became active in the great peace movements of the 1960s, with the protests against America's involvement in the war in Vietnam. The resulting work was called ''The American dream'', an enormous work that used painting and collage and anything else he could find on the 18 wooden panels. It took a great deal of his time and effort, taking about a year of full-time work. It started with a peaceful, dreamlike, serene ocean scene on one side, that worked its way to destruction and chaos in a mass of lighting, red colours and explosions on the other side. It was his comment on the direction the world might be headed and his response to a seemingly pointless war which could end in a [[nuclear holocaust]]. Many of the ideas from the work may have come from his experiences with alcohol, [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and other drugs. He believed that many of his ideas came from these experiences, and he often used drugs as a way of bringing the ideas from his subconscious. He sometimes took more than his body could handle, and had to be admitted to hospital for alcohol poisoning twice. Around him at the Hotel Chelsea, other artists and musicians took heroin, which Whiteley did not take at that time. The painting which was finally produced was made of a fantastic array of elements, including collage, photography and even flashing lights, with a total length of nearly 22 metres. However [[Marlborough-Gerson]], his gallery, refused to show the work, and he was so distraught that he decided to leave New York, and he 'fled' to [[Fiji]].\n\n==Appropriations==\nOne image which uses [[Vincent van Gogh|van Gogh]]'s style in a unique way is ''The night caf\u00e9'' (1971\u201372).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/357.1998/|title=The night caf\u00e9|last=Whiteley|first=Brett|date=1971\u201372|website=AGNSW collection record|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|access-date=12 April 2016}}</ref> He took the van Gogh painting and stretched the lines of the room to a single vanishing point, creating an image which appears fast moving and extremely vibrant and dynamic.\n\n==''Alchemy''==\nPart of his work ''Alchemy'' (1972\u201373)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/348.1998.a-r/|title=Alchemy|last=Whiteley|first=Brett|date=1972\u201373|website=AGNSW collection record|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|access-date=12 April 2016}}</ref> was featured on the cover of the [[Dire Straits]] live album ''[[Alchemy: Dire Straits Live|Alchemy]]'' although it had the addition of a guitar with lips held by a hand. Alchemy is the mythical ancient process of turning ordinary compounds into gold. The original painting, done between 1972 and 1973 was composed of many different elements and on 18 wood panels 203&nbsp;cm \u00d7 1615&nbsp;cm \u00d7 9&nbsp;cm. Reading from left to right, it begins with an exploding sun from a portrait of [[Yukio Mishima]] that Whiteley had started but never completed. The famed author Mishima had committed [[seppuku]] in 1970 and the literary mythology that arose of his apparent final vision of enlightenment in the form of the exploding sun, as he pressed the knife into his body, inspired and became the basis for this work. In terms of media, it used everything from feathers and part of a bird's nest to a glass eye, as well as shell pieces, plugs and brain in a work that becomes a transmutation of sexual organic landscapes and mindscapes. It has been regarded as a self-portrait, a giant outpouring of energy and ideas brought forth over a long period of time. According to art writer Bruce James, the self-conscious inclusion of the austere pronoun 'IT' that also makes up part of the work compacts life, passion, death and faith in a single empowering word and unites the notional wings of an altarpiece to nascent addiction.\n\n==Sydney Harbour and landscapes==\n[[File:Sydney domain whitley art work.jpg|thumb|''Almost Once'' (1991), [[The Domain, Sydney]]]]\n\nWhiteley loved painting [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] views in the 1970s such as in his paintings ''The balcony 2'' (1975)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/116.1981/|title=The balcony 2|last=Whiteley|first=Brett|year=1975|website=AGNSW collection record|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|access-date=12 April 2016}}</ref> and ''Interior with time past'' (1976),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://artsearch.nga.gov.au/Detail.cfm?IRN=115742&PICTAUS=TRUE|title=Interior with time past'|last=Whiteley|first=Brett|year=1976|website=National Gallery of Australia|publisher=National Gallery of Australia, Canberra, 2008|access-date=5 June 2017}}</ref> which show an interior and exterior view starting with a room that leads through open windows to the harbour full of boats outside. In the latter painting, the table in the front of the room close to the viewer has minutely decorated vases and small objects, while a drawing on the left and a sculpture to the extreme right show how Whiteley often used erotic images in his works. He painted a view of his friend [[Patrick White]] as a rock or a headland in ''Headland''; White had told Whiteley that in the next life he would like to come back as a rock. Whiteley painted other images of the Australian landscape, including a view of the south coast of New South Wales after it had been raining called ''The South Coast after rain''. He did paintings of the areas around [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], [[Oberon, New South Wales|Oberon]] and [[Marulan]], all in New South Wales. He soon settled in [[Lavender Bay, New South Wales|Lavender Bay]]. He painted abstracted images of bush scenes such as ''The bush'' (1966)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/350.1998.a-c/|title=The bush|last=Whiteley|first=Brett|year=1966|website=AGNSW collection record|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|access-date=12 April 2016}}</ref> and also images which resulted from experimentation with various drugs, such as alcohol in the humorous ''Self portrait after three bottles of wine'' (1971).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/354.1998/|title=Self portrait after three bottles of wine|last=Whiteley|first=Brett|year=1971|website=AGNSW collection record|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|access-date=12 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Archibald and other prizes==\nIn the late 1970s, Brett Whiteley won the [[Archibald Prize|Archibald]], [[Wynne Prize|Wynne]] and [[Sir John Sulman Prize|Sulman]] prizes several times. These are amongst the most prestigious art prizes in Australia. The competitions are run annually, with the award ceremonies being held at the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]].\n\nWhiteley's awards were:\n*1976\n**Archibald Prize: ''Self portrait in the studio''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/1.1977/|title=Self portrait in the studio|last=Whiteley|first=Brett|year=1976|website=AGNSW collection record|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|access-date=12 April 2016}}</ref>\n**Sulman Prize: ''Interior with time past''\n*1977\n**Wynne Prize: ''The Jacaranda tree (On Sydney Harbour)''\n*1978\n**Archibald Prize: ''[[Art, Life and the other thing]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/355.1998.a-c/|title=Art, life and the other thing|last=Whiteley|first=Brett|year=1978|website=AGNSW collection record|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|access-date=12 April 2016}}</ref>\n**Sulman Prize: ''Yellow nude''\n**Wynne Prize: ''[[Summer at Carcoar]]''\n\n1978 was the only year in which all three prizes have been won simultaneously by the same person.\n\nHis first Archibald award, ''Self portrait in the studio'', in deep bluish tones, shows an image of his studio at Lavender Bay overlooking Sydney Harbour, with his own reflection in a mirror shown at the bottom of the picture; a view of Sydney Harbour on the left establishes the location of the picture. Typically, the viewer is led deeper into the picture by means of minute detail. As with other works, there is evidence of Whiteley's love for [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], ultramarine blue, the Sydney Harbour location and for collected objects.\n\nHis second Archibald prize, ''Art, Life and the other thing'', shows his willingness to experiment with different media such as photography and collage. His reference to art history, including an image of the famous 1943 [[William Dobell]] portrait of [[Joshua Smith (artist)|Joshua Smith]], won a court case against accusations that it was a [[caricature]], not a portrait. The work experimented with warping and manipulating a straight self-portrait, incorporating his pictorial sense of addiction.\n\nHe won the Wynne Prize again, in 1984, with ''The South Coast after rain''.\n\n==TV documentary ==\nHe was the subject of an [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] television documentary called ''Difficult Pleasure'' directed by [[Don Featherstone (filmmaker)|Don Featherstone]] in 1989, which showed him talking about many of his main works, and his recent works such as ones done during a month-long trip to Paris; one of his last overseas trips. He also showed his large T-shirt collection, and talks about his sculpture, which he said is an aspect of his work that many people do not take seriously. ''Difficult pleasure'' is how he described painting, or creating art stating, \"Painting is an argument between what it looks like and what it means.\"\n\n==Final years==\n[[File:(1)Wendy Whiteleys Garden 045.jpg|thumb|Wendy Whiteley's garden in Sydney, where Brett Whiteley's ashes were scattered]]\nWhiteley became increasingly dependent on alcohol and also became addicted to heroin. His work was not always being praised by critics, although its market value continued to climb. He made several attempts to dry out and get off drugs completely, all ultimately unsuccessful. In 1989, he and [[Wendy Whiteley|Wendy]], whom he had always credited as his 'muse', divorced. He began a relationship with Janice Spencer, with whom he travelled to Japan, among other countries.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|loc={{Page missing|date=July 2018}}}} He also spent time with friends including [[Mark Knopfler]] and [[John Illsley]] from the band [[Dire Straits]].{{sfn|Wilson|2016|loc={{Page missing|date=July 2018}}}}\n\nIn June 1991, Whiteley was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of Australia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=869832&search_type=advanced&showInd=true |title=Whiteley, Brett (Advanced Search) |work=It's an Honour |publisher=[[Commonwealth of Australia]] |date=10 June 1991 }}</ref>\n\nOn 15 June 1992, aged 53, he was found dead from [[opiate]] overdose in a motel room in [[Thirroul, New South Wales|Thirroul]], north of [[Wollongong]].

He started drawing at a very early age. While he was a teenager, he painted on weekends in the Central West of New South Wales and [[Canberra]] with such works as ''The soup kitchen'' (1958).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/205.2012/|title=Portrait study for 'The soup kitchen'|last=Whiteley|first=Brett|year=1958|website=AGNSW collection record|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales (NSW)|access-date=12 April 2016}}</ref> Throughout 1956 to 1959 at the National Art School in East Sydney, Whiteley attended drawing classes. In 1959 he won an art scholarship sponsored by the Italian government and judged by [[Russell Drysdale]]. He left Australia for Europe on 23 January 1960.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|loc={{Page missing|date=July 2018}}}}\n\n==London==\nAfter meeting Bryan Robertson, the director of the [[Whitechapel Gallery]], Whiteley was included in the 1961 group show 'Recent Australian Painting,' where his ''Untitled red painting'' was bought by the [[Tate]] Gallery. He was the youngest living artist to have work purchased by the Tate, a record that still stands.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|loc={{Page missing|date=July 2018}}}} In 1962, Whiteley married [[Wendy Whiteley|Wendy Julius]]. Their only child, daughter [[Arkie Whiteley]], was born in London in 1964. While in London, Whiteley painted works in several different series: bathing, the zoo and the [[John Christie (murderer)|Christies]]. His paintings during these years were influenced by the modernist British art of the sixties \u2013 particularly the works of [[William Scott (artist)|William Scott]] and [[Roger Hilton]] \u2013 and were of brownish abstract forms. It was these abstract works which led to him being recognised as an artist, at a time when many other Australian artists were exhibiting in London, but from 1963 he moved away from abstraction towards figuration. His farewell to abstraction, ''Summer at Sigean'', was a record of his honeymoon in France.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|loc={{Page missing|date=July 2018}}}} He painted ''Woman in bath'' (1963)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/191.2000/|title=Woman in bath|last=Whiteley|first=Brett|year=1963|website=AGNSW collection record|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|access-date=12 April 2016}}</ref> as part of a series of works he was doing of bathroom pictures. It has primarily black on one side and has an image of his wife Wendy in a bathtub, seen from behind. Another in the series was a more abstracted ''Woman in the bath II'', which owed a debt to his yellow and red abstract paintings of the early sixties.\n\nIn 1964, while in London, Whiteley became fascinated by the murderer [[John Christie (murderer)|John Christie]], who had committed murders in the area near where Whiteley was staying in Ladbroke Grove. He painted a series of paintings based on these events, including ''Head of Christie''. Whiteley's intention was to portray the violence of the events, but not to go too far in showing something which people would not want to see. During this time, Whiteley also painted works based on the animals at the London Zoo, such as ''Two Indonesian giraffes'', which he found sometimes difficult. As he said: \"To draw animals, one has to work at white heat because they move so much, and partly because it is sometimes painful to feel what one guesses the animal 'feels' from inside.\" (Whiteley 1979: 1) Whiteley also made images of the beach, such as his yellowish painting and collage work ''The beach II'', which he painted on a brief visit to Australia before his return to London and his winning of a fellowship to America.\nWhiteley appears as a character in the book ''Falling Towards England'' by [[Clive James]] under the name Dibbs Buckley. His wife Wendy appears as \"Delish\".{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\n==New York==\nIn 1967 Whiteley won a [[Harkness Fellowship]] Scholarship to study and work in New York. He met other artists and musicians while he lived at the [[Hotel Chelsea]], where he befriended musicians [[Janis Joplin]] and [[Bob Dylan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/artists/whiteley-brett/|title=Brett Whiteley|website=AGNSW collection record|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|access-date=12 April 2016}}</ref> His first impression of New York was shown in the painting ''First sensation of New York City'', which showed streets with fast moving vehicles, street signs, hot dog vendors, and tall buildings. The Hotel Chelsea displayed several of Whiteley's paintings from the time he lived there, including ''Portrait of New York'' which was hung behind the reception desk.<ref>White, J. [http://www.artcollector.net.au/files/files/Artist%20profiles/Issue%205/Issue5_Jul1998_whiteley.pdf Collectors Dossier] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929095402/http://www.artcollector.net.au/files/files/Artist%20profiles/Issue%205/Issue5_Jul1998_whiteley.pdf |date=29 September 2009 }}, ''Australian Art Collector'', July 1998</ref>\n\nOne way that America influenced him is in the scale of his works. He was very much influenced by the [[peace movement]] at the time and came to believe that if he painted one huge painting which would advocate peace, then the Americans would withdraw their troops from [[Vietnam]]. Whiteley became active in the great peace movements of the 1960s, with the protests against America's involvement in the war in Vietnam. The resulting work was called ''The American dream'', an enormous work that used painting and collage and anything else he could find on the 18 wooden panels. It took a great deal of his time and effort, taking about a year of full-time work. It started with a peaceful, dreamlike, serene ocean scene on one side, that worked its way to destruction and chaos in a mass of lighting, red colours and explosions on the other side. It was his comment on the direction the world might be headed and his response to a seemingly pointless war which could end in a [[nuclear holocaust]]. Many of the ideas from the work may have come from his experiences with alcohol, [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and other drugs. He believed that many of his ideas came from these experiences, and he often used drugs as a way of bringing the ideas from his subconscious. He sometimes took more than his body could handle, and had to be admitted to hospital for alcohol poisoning twice. Around him at the Hotel Chelsea, other artists and musicians took heroin, which Whiteley did not take at that time. The painting which was finally produced was made of a fantastic array of elements, including collage, photography and even flashing lights, with a total length of nearly 22 metres. However [[Marlborough-Gerson]], his gallery, refused to show the work, and he was so distraught that he decided to leave New York, and he 'fled' to [[Fiji]].\n\n==Appropriations==\nOne image which uses [[Vincent van Gogh|van Gogh]]'s style in a unique way is ''The night caf\u00e9'' (1971\u201372).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/357.1998/|title=The night caf\u00e9|last=Whiteley|first=Brett|date=1971\u201372|website=AGNSW collection record|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|access-date=12 April 2016}}</ref> He took the van Gogh painting and stretched the lines of the room to a single vanishing point, creating an image which appears fast moving and extremely vibrant and dynamic.\n\n==''Alchemy''==\nPart of his work ''Alchemy'' (1972\u201373)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/348.1998.a-r/|title=Alchemy|last=Whiteley|first=Brett|date=1972\u201373|website=AGNSW collection record|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|access-date=12 April 2016}}</ref> was featured on the cover of the [[Dire Straits]] live album ''[[Alchemy: Dire Straits Live|Alchemy]]'' although it had the addition of a guitar with lips held by a hand. Alchemy is the mythical ancient process of turning ordinary compounds into gold. The original painting, done between 1972 and 1973 was composed of many different elements and on 18 wood panels 203&nbsp;cm \u00d7 1615&nbsp;cm \u00d7 9&nbsp;cm. Reading from left to right, it begins with an exploding sun from a portrait of [[Yukio Mishima]] that Whiteley had started but never completed. The famed author Mishima had committed [[seppuku]] in 1970 and the literary mythology that arose of his apparent final vision of enlightenment in the form of the exploding sun, as he pressed the knife into his body, inspired and became the basis for this work. In terms of media, it used everything from feathers and part of a bird's nest to a glass eye, as well as shell pieces, plugs and brain in a work that becomes a transmutation of sexual organic landscapes and mindscapes. It has been regarded as a self-portrait, a giant outpouring of energy and ideas brought forth over a long period of time. According to art writer Bruce James, the self-conscious inclusion of the austere pronoun 'IT' that also makes up part of the work compacts life, passion, death and faith in a single empowering word and unites the notional wings of an altarpiece to nascent addiction.\n\n==Sydney Harbour and landscapes==\n[[File:Sydney domain whitley art work.jpg|thumb|''Almost Once'' (1991), [[The Domain, Sydney]]]]\n\nWhiteley loved painting [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] views in the 1970s such as in his paintings ''The balcony 2'' (1975)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/116.1981/|title=The balcony 2|last=Whiteley|first=Brett|year=1975|website=AGNSW collection record|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|access-date=12 April 2016}}</ref> and ''Interior with time past'' (1976),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://artsearch.nga.gov.au/Detail.cfm?IRN=115742&PICTAUS=TRUE|title=Interior with time past'|last=Whiteley|first=Brett|year=1976|website=National Gallery of Australia|publisher=National Gallery of Australia, Canberra, 2008|access-date=5 June 2017}}</ref> which show an interior and exterior view starting with a room that leads through open windows to the harbour full of boats outside. In the latter painting, the table in the front of the room close to the viewer has minutely decorated vases and small objects, while a drawing on the left and a sculpture to the extreme right show how Whiteley often used erotic images in his works. He painted a view of his friend [[Patrick White]] as a rock or a headland in ''Headland''; White had told Whiteley that in the next life he would like to come back as a rock. Whiteley painted other images of the Australian landscape, including a view of the south coast of New South Wales after it had been raining called ''The South Coast after rain''. He did paintings of the areas around [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], [[Oberon, New South Wales|Oberon]] and [[Marulan]], all in New South Wales. He soon settled in [[Lavender Bay, New South Wales|Lavender Bay]]. He painted abstracted images of bush scenes such as ''The bush'' (1966)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/350.1998.a-c/|title=The bush|last=Whiteley|first=Brett|year=1966|website=AGNSW collection record|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|access-date=12 April 2016}}</ref> and also images which resulted from experimentation with various drugs, such as alcohol in the humorous ''Self portrait after three bottles of wine'' (1971).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/354.1998/|title=Self portrait after three bottles of wine|last=Whiteley|first=Brett|year=1971|website=AGNSW collection record|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|access-date=12 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Archibald and other prizes==\nIn the late 1970s, Brett Whiteley won the [[Archibald Prize|Archibald]], [[Wynne Prize|Wynne]] and [[Sir John Sulman Prize|Sulman]] prizes several times. These are amongst the most prestigious art prizes in Australia. The competitions are run annually, with the award ceremonies being held at the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]].\n\nWhiteley's awards were:\n*1976\n**Archibald Prize: ''Self portrait in the studio''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/1.1977/|title=Self portrait in the studio|last=Whiteley|first=Brett|year=1976|website=AGNSW collection record|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|access-date=12 April 2016}}</ref>\n**Sulman Prize: ''Interior with time past''\n*1977\n**Wynne Prize: ''The Jacaranda tree (On Sydney Harbour)''\n*1978\n**Archibald Prize: ''[[Art, Life and the other thing]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/355.1998.a-c/|title=Art, life and the other thing|last=Whiteley|first=Brett|year=1978|website=AGNSW collection record|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|access-date=12 April 2016}}</ref>\n**Sulman Prize: ''Yellow nude''\n**Wynne Prize: ''[[Summer at Carcoar]]''\n\n1978 was the only year in which all three prizes have been won simultaneously by the same person.\n\nHis first Archibald award, ''Self portrait in the studio'', in deep bluish tones, shows an image of his studio at Lavender Bay overlooking Sydney Harbour, with his own reflection in a mirror shown at the bottom of the picture; a view of Sydney Harbour on the left establishes the location of the picture. Typically, the viewer is led deeper into the picture by means of minute detail. As with other works, there is evidence of Whiteley's love for [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], ultramarine blue, the Sydney Harbour location and for collected objects.\n\nHis second Archibald prize, ''Art, Life and the other thing'', shows his willingness to experiment with different media such as photography and collage. His reference to art history, including an image of the famous 1943 [[William Dobell]] portrait of [[Joshua Smith (artist)|Joshua Smith]], won a court case against accusations that it was a [[caricature]], not a portrait. The work experimented with warping and manipulating a straight self-portrait, incorporating his pictorial sense of addiction.\n\nHe won the Wynne Prize again, in 1984, with ''The South Coast after rain''.\n\n==TV documentary ==\nHe was the subject of an [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] television documentary called ''Difficult Pleasure'' directed by [[Don Featherstone (filmmaker)|Don Featherstone]] in 1989, which showed him talking about many of his main works, and his recent works such as ones done during a month-long trip to Paris; one of his last overseas trips. He also showed his large T-shirt collection, and talks about his sculpture, which he said is an aspect of his work that many people do not take seriously. ''Difficult pleasure'' is how he described painting, or creating art stating, \"Painting is an argument between what it looks like and what it means.\"\n\n==Final years==\n[[File:(1)Wendy Whiteleys Garden 045.jpg|thumb|Wendy Whiteley's garden in Sydney, where Brett Whiteley's ashes were scattered]]\nWhiteley became increasingly dependent on alcohol and also became addicted to heroin. His work was not always being praised by critics, although its market value continued to climb. He made several attempts to dry out and get off drugs completely, all ultimately unsuccessful. In 1989, he and [[Wendy Whiteley|Wendy]], whom he had always credited as his 'muse', divorced. He began a relationship with Janice Spencer, with whom he travelled to Japan, among other countries.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|loc={{Page missing|date=July 2018}}}} He also spent time with friends including [[Mark Knopfler]] and [[John Illsley]] from the band [[Dire Straits]].{{sfn|Wilson|2016|loc={{Page missing|date=July 2018}}}}\n\nIn June 1991, Whiteley was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of Australia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=869832&search_type=advanced&showInd=true |title=Whiteley, Brett (Advanced Search) |work=It's an Honour |publisher=[[Commonwealth of Australia]] |date=10 June 1991 }}</ref>\n\nOn 15 June 1992, aged 53, he was found dead from [[opiate]] overdose in a motel room in [[Thirroul, New South Wales|Thirroul]], north of [[Wollongong]].

A Gujarati origin for scripts of Sumatra, Sulawesi and the Philippines. Proceedings of Berkeley Linguistics Society 36:376-91</ref> Its immediate ancestor was very likely a South Sulawesi script, probably Old Makassar or a close ancestor. This is because of the lack of coda consonant markers in Baybayin. Philippine and Gujarati languages have coda consonants, so it is unlikely that their indication would have been dropped had Baybayin been based directly on a Gujarati model. South Sulawesi languages, however, lack coda consonants and there is no way of representing them in the Bugis and Makassar scripts. The most likely explanation for the absence of coda consonant markers in Baybayin is therefore that its direct ancestor was a South Sulawesi script. Sulawesi lies directly to the south of the Philippines and these is evidence of trade routes between the two. Baybayin must therefore have been developed in the Philippines in the fifteenth century CE as the Bugis-Makassar script was developed in South Sulawesi no earlier than 1400 CE.<ref>Caldwell, Ian. 1988. Ten Bugis Texts; South Sulawesi 1300-1600. PhD thesis, Australian National University, p.17</ref> However, Geoff Wade has argued that the ancestor of the Baybayin script was a Cham script.\n \n===Early Sources===\nBaybayin was noted by the Spanish priest [[Pedro Chirino]] in 1604 and [[Antonio de Morga]] in 1609 to be known by most Filipinos, and was generally used for personal writings, poetry, etc. However, according to [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]], there were some [[datus]] from the 1590s who could not sign affidavits or oaths, and witnesses who could not sign land deeds in the 1620s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scott|1984|p=210}}</ref><ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\">[https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/the-life-death-and-resurgence-of-baybayin-a1962-20170811-lfrm The Life, Death, and Resurgence of Baybayin]</ref>\n\n====Abecedaries====\nThe best known evidence of where this Indic script we call today as Baybayin came about is from the \"abecedaries\" evidence. It is an example of letters of the script arranged more or less in the order the Spaniards knew, reproduced by the Spanish and other observers in the different regions of Luzon and Visayas. Another source of evidence are the archival documents preserved and recovered.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nFrom these two sources, it is clear that the Baybayin scripts was used in Luzon, Palawan, Mindoro, as far as Pangasinan in the north, and in Ilocos, Panay, Leyte, and Iloilo, but there are no proof supporting that Baybayin reached Mindanao. From what is available, it seems clear that the Luzon and Palawan varieties have started to develop in different ways in the 1500s, way before the Spaniards conquered what we know today as the Philippines. This puts Luzon and Palawan as the oldest regions where Baybayin was and is used. It is also notable that the script used in Pampanga had already developed special shapes for four letters by the early 1600s, different from the ones used elsewhere. It is equally important to note that this ancient Kapampangan script is very different from the experiment called \"modern Kulitan\" which was taught in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>So we can say that there were three somewhat distinct varieties of a single script in the late 1500s and 1600s, though they could not be described as three different scripts any more than the different styles of Latin script across medieval or modern Europe with their slightly different sets of letters and spelling systems.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\">[https://www.quora.com/Is-Baybayin-really-a-writing-system-in-the-entire-pre-hispanic-Philippines-Whats-the-basis-for-making-it-a-national-writing-system-if-pre-hispanic-kingdoms-weren-t-homogenous/answer/Christopher-Ray-Miller?share=71e5e264&srid=hyV8\"]</ref>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe only modern scripts that descended directly from the original Baybayin script through natural development are the Palaw'an script inherited from the Tagbanwa in Palawan, the Buhid and Hanun\u00f3o scripts in Mindoro, the ancient Kapampangan script used in the 1600s but has been supplanted by a constructed script called \"modern Kulitan\", and of course the Tagalog script. There is no evidence for any other regional scripts; like the modern Kulitan experiment in Pampanga. Any other scripts are recent inventions based on one or another of the abecedaries from old Spanish descriptions.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\n====Influence of Greater India====\n{{See also | List_of_loanwords_in_Tagalog#Sanskrit | label 1 = Indian Sanskrit loanwords in Tagalog }}\n\nHistorically [[Southeast Asia]] was under the influence of [[Greater India|Ancient India]], where numerous [[Indianized kingdom|Indianized principalities]] and empires flourished for several centuries in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam.

It was written in the Kawi script in a variety of [[Old Malay]] containing numerous loanwords from Sanskrit and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin is ambiguous between [[Old Javanese]] and [[Old Tagalog]].  One hypothesis therefore reasons that, since Kawi is the earliest attestation of writing on the Philippines, then Baybayin may have descended from Kawi or vice versa. It is the kawi inspired ancient alphabet of the people of Baybay in the Lakanate of Lawan used to write letters to relatives in far places where they migrate. Scott mentioned the Bingi of Lawan siday (local epic) originally written in Baybay, a place in ancient Lawan. It is believed that there were at least 16 different types of writing systems present around the Philippines prior to our colonization. Baybayin is just one of them, which was said to be of widespread use among coastal groups such as the Tagalog, Bisaya, Iloko, Pangasinan, Bikol, and Pampanga around the 16th century. One theory is that \"Baybayin\" got its name from a place or a word \"baybay,\" or seashore in ancient Tagalog and present Waray dialect (Casal,CNN).\n\nA second example of Kawi script can be seen on the [[Kawi script|Butuan Ivory Seal]], though it has not been dated.\n\nAn earthenware burial jar, called the \"Calatagan Pot,\" found in [[Calatagan, Batangas|Batangas]] is inscribed with characters strikingly similar to Baybayin, and is claimed to have been inscribed ca. 1300 AD.  However, its authenticity has not yet been proven.\n\nMany of the writing systems of Southeast Asia descended from ancient scripts used in India over 2000 years ago. Although Baybayin shares some important features with these scripts, such as all the consonants being pronounced with the vowel a and the use of special marks to change this sound, there is no evidence that it is so old.\n\nThe shapes of the baybayin characters bear a slight resemblance to the ancient Kavi script of Java, Indonesia, which fell into disuse in the 15th century. However, as mentioned earlier in the Spanish accounts, the advent of the Baybayin in the Philippines was considered a fairly recent event in the 16th century and the Filipinos at that time believed that their Baybayin came from [[Borneo]].\n\nThis theory is supported by the fact that the Baybayin script could not show syllable final consonants, which are very common in most Philippine languages. (See Final Consonants) This indicates that the script was recently acquired and had not yet been modified to suit the needs of its new users. Also, this same shortcoming in the Baybayin was a normal trait of the script and language of the Bugis people of [[Sulawesi]], which is directly south of the Philippines and directly east of Borneo. Thus most scholars believe that the Baybayin may have descended from the Buginese script or, more likely, a related lost script from the island of Sulawesi.\n\nAlthough one of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s shipmates, [[Antonio Pigafetta]], wrote that the people of the Visayas were not literate in 1521, the Baybayin had already arrived there by 1567 when [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] reported that, \"They [the Visayans] have their letters and characters like those of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], from whom they learned them.\" Then, a century later [[Francisco Alcina]] wrote about:\n\nThe characters of these natives, or, better said, those that have been in use for a few years in these parts, an art which was communicated to them from the Tagalogs, and the latter learned it from the Borneans who came from the great island of Borneo to [[Manila]], with whom they have considerable traffic...\nFrom these Borneans the Tagalogs learned their characters, and from them the Visayans, so they call them Moro characters or letters because the Moros taught them... [the Visayans] learned [the Moros'] letters, which many use today, and the women much more than the men, which they write and read more readily than the latter.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\nBut other sources say that the Visayans derived their writing system from those of [[Toba Batak people|Toba]], Borneo, Celebes, Ancient Java, and from the Edicts of the ancient Indian emperor [[Ashoka]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lasislasvisayase00reye Isabelo de los Reyes y Florentino, ''Las Islas Visayas en la \u00c9poca de la Conquista'' (Segunda edici\u00f3n), Manila: 1889, Tipo-Litograf\u00eda de Chofk\u00e9  y C.a, p. 82.]</ref>\n\n[[File:Baybayin sample.svg|thumb|Baybayin calligraphy of the Tagalog people]]\n\n==== Old Sumatran \"Malay\" scripts ====\nAnother hypothesis states that a script or script used to write one of the Malay languages was adopted and became Baybayin. In particular, the [[Pallava]] script from Sumatra is attested to the 7th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bahasa-malaysia-simple-fun.com/bahasa-melayu-kuno.html |title=Bahasa Melayu Kuno |website=Bahasa Malaysia Online Learning Resource |accessdate=11 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226183127/http://www.bahasa-malaysia-simple-fun.com/bahasa-melayu-kuno.html |archivedate=26 December 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==== Old Assamese ====\nThe [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]] was a precursor to ''[[devan\u0101gar\u012b]]''. This hypothesis states that a version of this script was introduced to the Philippines via [[Bengal]], before ultimately evolving into ''baybayin''.\n\n==== Cham ====\nFinally, an early Cham script from [[Champa]] \u2014 in what is now southern [[Vietnam]] and southeastern [[Cambodia]] \u2014 could have been introduced or borrowed and adapted into Baybayin.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Filipino sword filipino dha baybayin script.JPG|thumb|right|A Filipino [[Dha (sword)|dha]] sword inscribed with Baybayin characters.]]\nThe writing system is an [[abugida]] system using consonant-vowel combinations. Each character, written in its basic form, is a consonant ending with the vowel \"A\". To produce consonants ending with the other vowel sounds, a mark is placed either above the consonant (to produce an \"E\" or \"I\" sound) or below the consonant (to produce an \"O\" or \"U\" sound). The mark is called a ''kudlit''. The kudlit does not apply to stand-alone vowels. Vowels themselves have their own glyphs.\n\nThere is only one symbol or character for '''Da''' or '''Ra''' as they were allophones in many [[languages of the Philippines]], where '''Ra''' occurred in intervocalic positions and '''Da''' occurred elsewhere. The grammatical rule has survived in modern Filipino, so that when a '''d''' is between two vowels, it becomes an '''r''', as in the words ''dang\u00e1l'' (honour) and ''marang\u00e1l'' (honourable), or ''dunong'' (knowledge) and ''marunong'' (knowledgeable), and even ''raw'' for ''daw'' (he said, she said, they said, it was said, allegedly, reportedly, supposedly) and ''rin'' for ''din'' (also, too) after vowels.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/> This variant of the script is not used for Ilokano, Pangasinan, Bikolano, and other Philippine languages to name a few, as these languages have separate symbols for '''Da''' and '''Ra'''.\n\nAs well the same letter is used to represent the '''Pa''' and '''Fa''' (or '''Pha'''), '''Ba''' and '''Va''', '''Sa''' and '''Za''' which were also allophonic.\n\nBeside these phonetic considerations, the script is monocameral and does not use letter case for distinguishing proper names or initials of words starting sentences.\n\n===Writing materials===\nTraditionally, baybayin was written upon [[palm leaves]] with styli or upon [[bamboo]] with knives.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFQOAQAAMAAJ&q=baybayin+palm+leaves&dq=baybayin+palm+leaves&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y|title=Filipinas|last=|first=|date=1995-01-01|publisher=Filipinas Pub.|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=60|language=en|quote=|via=|issue=36-44}}</ref> The curved shape of the letterforms of baybayin is a direct result of this heritage; straight lines would have torn the leaves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|title=Cochin Palm Leaf Fiscals|date=2001-04-01|website=Princely States Report > Archived Features|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113205231/http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|archive-date=2017-01-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the era of Spanish colonization, most baybayin began being written with ink on [[paper]], but in some parts of the country the traditional art form has been retained.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bakitwhy.com/articles/fundamentals-baybayin|title=The Fundamentals of Baybayin|last=Lazaro|first=David|date=2009-10-23|work=|newspaper=BakitWhy|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|via=The Bathala Project}}</ref>\n\n===Significant examples===\n[[File:Monreal stone.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Monreal Stones|Monreal stone]], which is the centerpiece at the Baybayin section of the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Manila)|National Museum of Anthropology]].]]\nThe Ticao stone inscription, also known as the Monreal stone or Rizal stone, is a limestone tablet that contains Baybayin characters.

Because of this, Francisco L\u00f3pez introduced his own kudlit in 1620, called a ''sabat'' or ''krus'', that cancelled the implicit ''a'' vowel sound. The kudlit was in the form of a \"+\" sign,<ref name=\"bibingka\">[http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm Tagalog script] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823214513/http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm |date=August 23, 2008 }}. Accessed September 2, 2008.</ref> in reference to [[Christianity]]. This cross-shaped kudlit functions exactly the same as the ''[[virama]]'' in the [[Devanagari]] script of [[India]]. In fact, Unicode calls this kudlit the ''Tagalog Sign Virama''. See sample above in Characteristics Section.\n\nThe confusion over the use of marks may have contributed to the demise of Baybayin over time. The desire of Francisco Lopez (1620) for Baybayin to conform to the Spanish ''alfabetos'' paved the way for the invention of a cross sign. Such introduction was uniquely a standalone event that was blindly copied by succeeding writers up to the present. Sevilla and Alvero (1939) said, \"The marks required in the formation of syllables are: the tuldok or point (.) and the bawas or minus sign (-).\" The bawas or minus sign (-) that is placed before the script to remove the paired vowel appears more logical than the cross or plus sign (+) of Lopez.<ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\"/>\n\n==== \"Nga\" character ====\nA single character represented \"'''nga'''\". The current version of the Filipino alphabet still retains \"'''ng'''\" as a [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]].\n\n==== Punctuation ====\nWords written in baybayin were written in a continuous flow, and the only form of punctuation was a single vertical or slanted line ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1735}}'''), or more often, a pair of vertical or slanted lines ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1736}}'''). These lines (similar to [[danda]] signs in other Indic abugidas) fulfill the function of a comma, period, or unpredictably separate sets of words.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\n==Usage==\n\n====Pre-colonial and colonial usage====\nBaybayin historically was used in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and to a lesser extent [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] speaking areas. Its use spread to [[Ilokano language|Ilokanos]] when the Spanish promoted its use with the printing of Bibles. Related scripts, such as [[Hanunoo script|Hanun\u00f3o]], [[Buhid script|Buhid]], and [[Tagbanwa alphabet|Tagbanwa]] are still used today, along with the [[Kulitan alphabet]].\nAmong the earliest literature on the orthography of [[Visayan languages]] were those of Jesuit priest Ezguerra with his {{lang|es|Arte de la lengua bisaya}} in 1747<ref>{{cite book\n| title      = Arte de la lengua bisaya de la provincia de Leyte\n| author     = P.

However, when the Spaniards succeeded in colonizing the islands, they abolished the practice and burned all documents they captured from the natives while forcefully establishing a Roman Catholic-based rule. Records on Philippine seals were forgotten until in the 1970s when actual ancient seals made of ivory were found in an archaeological site in [[Butuan]]. The seal, now known as the [[Butuan Ivory Seal]], has been declared as a National Cultural Treasure. The seal is inscribed with the word \"Butwan\" through a native ''baybayin'' script. The discovery of the seal proved the theory that pre-colonial Filipinos, or at least in coastal areas, used seals on paper. Before the discovery of the seal, it was only thought that ancient Filipinos used bamboo, metal, bark, and leaves for writing. The presence of paper documents in the classical era of the Philippines is also backed by a research of Otley Beyer stating that Spanish friars 'boasted' about burning ancient Philippine documents with ''baybayin'' inscriptions, one of the reasons why ancient documents from the Philippines are almost non-existent in present time. The ivory seal is now housed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]]. Nowadays, younger generations are trying to revive the usage of seals, notably in signing pieces of art such as drawings, paintings, and literary works.<ref name=\"NMPHseal\">[http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Seal.html Nation Museum Collections Seals]</ref>\n\n===Modern Usage===\n[[File:Gawad Lakandula.png|thumb|150px|The insignia of the [[Order of Lakandula]] contains an inscription with Baybayin characters represents the name ''[[Lakandula]]'', read counterclockwise from the top.]]\nIt is used in the most current [[Banknotes of the Philippine peso#New Generation Currency series (current)|New Generation Currency series of the Philippine peso]] issued in the last quarter of 2010.

These signs (which may be presented vertically like Indic dandas, or slanted like forward slashes) are unified across Philippines scripts and were encoded by Unicode in the [[Hanunoo alphabet|Hanun\u00f3o script]] block.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/ch17.pdf#G26723|title=Chapter 17: Indonesia and Oceania, Philippine Scripts|publisher=Unicode Consortium|date=March 2020}}</ref> Space separation of words was historically not used on traditional supports, but is common today.\n\n=== Example sentences ===\n* {{Script|Tglg|\u170c\u170b\u1705\u1714 \u1707\u1712 \u1708\u1704\u1714\u1703\u1703\u1702\u1708\u170f\u1700\u1708\u1714\u1735 \u1700\u170c\u1714 \u170b\u1704\u1714 \u1709\u1703\u1711\u1712\u1708\u1711\u1713\u1708\u1714\u1736}}\n*: ''Yamang \u2018di nagkakaunawaan, ay mag-pakahinahon.''\n*: Remain calm in disagreements.\n* {{Script|Tglg|\u170b\u1704\u1714\u1706\u1708\u1712\u170b\u1714 \u1700\u170c\u1714 \u1707\u1712 \u170a\u1712\u1707\u1713\u1736}}\n*: ''Magtanim ay 'di bir\u00f2.''\n*: Planting is not a joke.\n* {{Script|Tglg|\u170b\u170b\u1711\u170e\u1712\u1708\u1714 \u1703\u1712\u1706 \u1711\u1705\u1714\u1704\u1705\u1714 \u1710 \u1709\u1713\u170b\u1713\u1706\u1712 \u1700\u1705\u1714 \u170a\u1713\u1711\u1713\u1703\u1714 \u1703\u1713\u1736}}\n*: ''M\u00e1mahalin kit\u00e1 hangg\u00e1ng sa pumut\u00ed ang buh\u00f3k ko.''\n*: I will love you until my hair turns white.\n\n=== Collation ===\n* In the ''[[Doctrina Christiana]]'', the letters of Baybayin were collated (without any connection with other similar script, except sorting vowels before consonants) as:\n*: '''A, U/O, I/E;

Baybayin is well known because it was carefully documented by scribes during the colonial era. Baybayin was extensively documented by the Spanish.{{Sfn |Scott|1984|pp= 57\u201358}} \n\nIt is one of a number of individual writing systems used in [[Southeast Asia]], nearly all of which are [[abugida]]s where any consonant is pronounced with the inherent vowel ''a'' following it\u2014[[diacritic]]s being used to express other vowels.

A Gujarati origin for scripts of Sumatra, Sulawesi and the Philippines. Proceedings of Berkeley Linguistics Society 36:376-91</ref> Its immediate ancestor was very likely a South Sulawesi script, probably Old Makassar or a close ancestor. This is because of the lack of coda consonant markers in Baybayin. Philippine and Gujarati languages have coda consonants, so it is unlikely that their indication would have been dropped had Baybayin been based directly on a Gujarati model. South Sulawesi languages, however, lack coda consonants and there is no way of representing them in the Bugis and Makassar scripts. The most likely explanation for the absence of coda consonant markers in Baybayin is therefore that its direct ancestor was a South Sulawesi script. Sulawesi lies directly to the south of the Philippines and these is evidence of trade routes between the two. Baybayin must therefore have been developed in the Philippines in the fifteenth century CE as the Bugis-Makassar script was developed in South Sulawesi no earlier than 1400 CE.<ref>Caldwell, Ian. 1988. Ten Bugis Texts; South Sulawesi 1300-1600. PhD thesis, Australian National University, p.17</ref> However, Geoff Wade has argued that the ancestor of the Baybayin script was a Cham script.\n \n===Early Sources===\nBaybayin was noted by the Spanish priest [[Pedro Chirino]] in 1604 and [[Antonio de Morga]] in 1609 to be known by most Filipinos, and was generally used for personal writings, poetry, etc. However, according to [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]], there were some [[datus]] from the 1590s who could not sign affidavits or oaths, and witnesses who could not sign land deeds in the 1620s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scott|1984|p=210}}</ref><ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\">[https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/the-life-death-and-resurgence-of-baybayin-a1962-20170811-lfrm The Life, Death, and Resurgence of Baybayin]</ref>\n\n====Abecedaries====\nThe best known evidence of where this Indic script we call today as Baybayin came about is from the \"abecedaries\" evidence. It is an example of letters of the script arranged more or less in the order the Spaniards knew, reproduced by the Spanish and other observers in the different regions of Luzon and Visayas. Another source of evidence are the archival documents preserved and recovered.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nFrom these two sources, it is clear that the Baybayin scripts was used in Luzon, Palawan, Mindoro, as far as Pangasinan in the north, and in Ilocos, Panay, Leyte, and Iloilo, but there are no proof supporting that Baybayin reached Mindanao. From what is available, it seems clear that the Luzon and Palawan varieties have started to develop in different ways in the 1500s, way before the Spaniards conquered what we know today as the Philippines. This puts Luzon and Palawan as the oldest regions where Baybayin was and is used. It is also notable that the script used in Pampanga had already developed special shapes for four letters by the early 1600s, different from the ones used elsewhere. It is equally important to note that this ancient Kapampangan script is very different from the experiment called \"modern Kulitan\" which was taught in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>So we can say that there were three somewhat distinct varieties of a single script in the late 1500s and 1600s, though they could not be described as three different scripts any more than the different styles of Latin script across medieval or modern Europe with their slightly different sets of letters and spelling systems.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\">[https://www.quora.com/Is-Baybayin-really-a-writing-system-in-the-entire-pre-hispanic-Philippines-Whats-the-basis-for-making-it-a-national-writing-system-if-pre-hispanic-kingdoms-weren-t-homogenous/answer/Christopher-Ray-Miller?share=71e5e264&srid=hyV8\"]</ref>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe only modern scripts that descended directly from the original Baybayin script through natural development are the Palaw'an script inherited from the Tagbanwa in Palawan, the Buhid and Hanun\u00f3o scripts in Mindoro, the ancient Kapampangan script used in the 1600s but has been supplanted by a constructed script called \"modern Kulitan\", and of course the Tagalog script. There is no evidence for any other regional scripts; like the modern Kulitan experiment in Pampanga. Any other scripts are recent inventions based on one or another of the abecedaries from old Spanish descriptions.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\n====Influence of Greater India====\n{{See also | List_of_loanwords_in_Tagalog#Sanskrit | label 1 = Indian Sanskrit loanwords in Tagalog }}\n\nHistorically [[Southeast Asia]] was under the influence of [[Greater India|Ancient India]], where numerous [[Indianized kingdom|Indianized principalities]] and empires flourished for several centuries in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam.

It was written in the Kawi script in a variety of [[Old Malay]] containing numerous loanwords from Sanskrit and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin is ambiguous between [[Old Javanese]] and [[Old Tagalog]].  One hypothesis therefore reasons that, since Kawi is the earliest attestation of writing on the Philippines, then Baybayin may have descended from Kawi or vice versa. It is the kawi inspired ancient alphabet of the people of Baybay in the Lakanate of Lawan used to write letters to relatives in far places where they migrate. Scott mentioned the Bingi of Lawan siday (local epic) originally written in Baybay, a place in ancient Lawan. It is believed that there were at least 16 different types of writing systems present around the Philippines prior to our colonization. Baybayin is just one of them, which was said to be of widespread use among coastal groups such as the Tagalog, Bisaya, Iloko, Pangasinan, Bikol, and Pampanga around the 16th century. One theory is that \"Baybayin\" got its name from a place or a word \"baybay,\" or seashore in ancient Tagalog and present Waray dialect (Casal,CNN).\n\nA second example of Kawi script can be seen on the [[Kawi script|Butuan Ivory Seal]], though it has not been dated.\n\nAn earthenware burial jar, called the \"Calatagan Pot,\" found in [[Calatagan, Batangas|Batangas]] is inscribed with characters strikingly similar to Baybayin, and is claimed to have been inscribed ca. 1300 AD.  However, its authenticity has not yet been proven.\n\nMany of the writing systems of Southeast Asia descended from ancient scripts used in India over 2000 years ago. Although Baybayin shares some important features with these scripts, such as all the consonants being pronounced with the vowel a and the use of special marks to change this sound, there is no evidence that it is so old.\n\nThe shapes of the baybayin characters bear a slight resemblance to the ancient Kavi script of Java, Indonesia, which fell into disuse in the 15th century. However, as mentioned earlier in the Spanish accounts, the advent of the Baybayin in the Philippines was considered a fairly recent event in the 16th century and the Filipinos at that time believed that their Baybayin came from [[Borneo]].\n\nThis theory is supported by the fact that the Baybayin script could not show syllable final consonants, which are very common in most Philippine languages. (See Final Consonants) This indicates that the script was recently acquired and had not yet been modified to suit the needs of its new users. Also, this same shortcoming in the Baybayin was a normal trait of the script and language of the Bugis people of [[Sulawesi]], which is directly south of the Philippines and directly east of Borneo. Thus most scholars believe that the Baybayin may have descended from the Buginese script or, more likely, a related lost script from the island of Sulawesi.\n\nAlthough one of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s shipmates, [[Antonio Pigafetta]], wrote that the people of the Visayas were not literate in 1521, the Baybayin had already arrived there by 1567 when [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] reported that, \"They [the Visayans] have their letters and characters like those of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], from whom they learned them.\" Then, a century later [[Francisco Alcina]] wrote about:\n\nThe characters of these natives, or, better said, those that have been in use for a few years in these parts, an art which was communicated to them from the Tagalogs, and the latter learned it from the Borneans who came from the great island of Borneo to [[Manila]], with whom they have considerable traffic...\nFrom these Borneans the Tagalogs learned their characters, and from them the Visayans, so they call them Moro characters or letters because the Moros taught them... [the Visayans] learned [the Moros'] letters, which many use today, and the women much more than the men, which they write and read more readily than the latter.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\nBut other sources say that the Visayans derived their writing system from those of [[Toba Batak people|Toba]], Borneo, Celebes, Ancient Java, and from the Edicts of the ancient Indian emperor [[Ashoka]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lasislasvisayase00reye Isabelo de los Reyes y Florentino, ''Las Islas Visayas en la \u00c9poca de la Conquista'' (Segunda edici\u00f3n), Manila: 1889, Tipo-Litograf\u00eda de Chofk\u00e9  y C.a, p. 82.]</ref>\n\n[[File:Baybayin sample.svg|thumb|Baybayin calligraphy of the Tagalog people]]\n\n==== Old Sumatran \"Malay\" scripts ====\nAnother hypothesis states that a script or script used to write one of the Malay languages was adopted and became Baybayin. In particular, the [[Pallava]] script from Sumatra is attested to the 7th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bahasa-malaysia-simple-fun.com/bahasa-melayu-kuno.html |title=Bahasa Melayu Kuno |website=Bahasa Malaysia Online Learning Resource |accessdate=11 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226183127/http://www.bahasa-malaysia-simple-fun.com/bahasa-melayu-kuno.html |archivedate=26 December 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==== Old Assamese ====\nThe [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]] was a precursor to ''[[devan\u0101gar\u012b]]''. This hypothesis states that a version of this script was introduced to the Philippines via [[Bengal]], before ultimately evolving into ''baybayin''.\n\n==== Cham ====\nFinally, an early Cham script from [[Champa]] \u2014 in what is now southern [[Vietnam]] and southeastern [[Cambodia]] \u2014 could have been introduced or borrowed and adapted into Baybayin.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Filipino sword filipino dha baybayin script.JPG|thumb|right|A Filipino [[Dha (sword)|dha]] sword inscribed with Baybayin characters.]]\nThe writing system is an [[abugida]] system using consonant-vowel combinations. Each character, written in its basic form, is a consonant ending with the vowel \"A\". To produce consonants ending with the other vowel sounds, a mark is placed either above the consonant (to produce an \"E\" or \"I\" sound) or below the consonant (to produce an \"O\" or \"U\" sound). The mark is called a ''kudlit''. The kudlit does not apply to stand-alone vowels. Vowels themselves have their own glyphs.\n\nThere is only one symbol or character for '''Da''' or '''Ra''' as they were allophones in many [[languages of the Philippines]], where '''Ra''' occurred in intervocalic positions and '''Da''' occurred elsewhere. The grammatical rule has survived in modern Filipino, so that when a '''d''' is between two vowels, it becomes an '''r''', as in the words ''dang\u00e1l'' (honour) and ''marang\u00e1l'' (honourable), or ''dunong'' (knowledge) and ''marunong'' (knowledgeable), and even ''raw'' for ''daw'' (he said, she said, they said, it was said, allegedly, reportedly, supposedly) and ''rin'' for ''din'' (also, too) after vowels.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/> This variant of the script is not used for Ilokano, Pangasinan, Bikolano, and other Philippine languages to name a few, as these languages have separate symbols for '''Da''' and '''Ra'''.\n\nAs well the same letter is used to represent the '''Pa''' and '''Fa''' (or '''Pha'''), '''Ba''' and '''Va''', '''Sa''' and '''Za''' which were also allophonic.\n\nBeside these phonetic considerations, the script is monocameral and does not use letter case for distinguishing proper names or initials of words starting sentences.\n\n===Writing materials===\nTraditionally, baybayin was written upon [[palm leaves]] with styli or upon [[bamboo]] with knives.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFQOAQAAMAAJ&q=baybayin+palm+leaves&dq=baybayin+palm+leaves&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y|title=Filipinas|last=|first=|date=1995-01-01|publisher=Filipinas Pub.|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=60|language=en|quote=|via=|issue=36-44}}</ref> The curved shape of the letterforms of baybayin is a direct result of this heritage; straight lines would have torn the leaves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|title=Cochin Palm Leaf Fiscals|date=2001-04-01|website=Princely States Report > Archived Features|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113205231/http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|archive-date=2017-01-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the era of Spanish colonization, most baybayin began being written with ink on [[paper]], but in some parts of the country the traditional art form has been retained.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bakitwhy.com/articles/fundamentals-baybayin|title=The Fundamentals of Baybayin|last=Lazaro|first=David|date=2009-10-23|work=|newspaper=BakitWhy|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|via=The Bathala Project}}</ref>\n\n===Significant examples===\n[[File:Monreal stone.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Monreal Stones|Monreal stone]], which is the centerpiece at the Baybayin section of the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Manila)|National Museum of Anthropology]].]]\nThe Ticao stone inscription, also known as the Monreal stone or Rizal stone, is a limestone tablet that contains Baybayin characters. Found by pupils of [[Rizal Elementary School]] on [[Ticao Island]] in Monreal town, [[Masbate]], which had scraped the mud off their shoes and slippers on two irregular shaped [[limestone]] tablets before entering their classroom, they are now housed at a section of the [[National Museum of the Philippines]], which weighs 30 kilos, is 11 centimeters thick, 54&nbsp;cm long and 44&nbsp;cm wide while the other is 6&nbsp;cm thick, 20&nbsp;cm long and 18&nbsp;cm wide.<ref name=\"INQPHmuddied\">[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/616407/muddied-stones-reveal-ancient-scripts Muddied stones reveal ancient scripts]</ref><ref name=\"ELIZAGAticao\">[http://heritage.elizaga.net/explorations/borrinaga/ticao-stones.pdf Romancing the Ticao Stones: Preliminary Transcription, Decipherment, Translation, and Some Notes]</ref>\n\n=== Two styles of writing ===\n\n[[File:DoctrinaChristianaEspanolaYTagala8-9.jpg|thumb|Pages of the ''Doctrina Christiana'', [[First book of the Spanish Philippines|an early Christian book]] in Spanish and Tagalog (1593)]]\n\n==== Virama Kudlit \"style\" ====\n\nThe original writing method was particularly difficult for the Spanish priests who were translating books into the vernaculars. Because of this, Francisco L\u00f3pez introduced his own kudlit in 1620, called a ''sabat'' or ''krus'', that cancelled the implicit ''a'' vowel sound. The kudlit was in the form of a \"+\" sign,<ref name=\"bibingka\">[http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm Tagalog script] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823214513/http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm |date=August 23, 2008 }}. Accessed September 2, 2008.</ref> in reference to [[Christianity]]. This cross-shaped kudlit functions exactly the same as the ''[[virama]]'' in the [[Devanagari]] script of [[India]]. In fact, Unicode calls this kudlit the ''Tagalog Sign Virama''. See sample above in Characteristics Section.\n\nThe confusion over the use of marks may have contributed to the demise of Baybayin over time. The desire of Francisco Lopez (1620) for Baybayin to conform to the Spanish ''alfabetos'' paved the way for the invention of a cross sign. Such introduction was uniquely a standalone event that was blindly copied by succeeding writers up to the present. Sevilla and Alvero (1939) said, \"The marks required in the formation of syllables are: the tuldok or point (.) and the bawas or minus sign (-).\" The bawas or minus sign (-) that is placed before the script to remove the paired vowel appears more logical than the cross or plus sign (+) of Lopez.<ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\"/>\n\n==== \"Nga\" character ====\nA single character represented \"'''nga'''\". The current version of the Filipino alphabet still retains \"'''ng'''\" as a [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]].\n\n==== Punctuation ====\nWords written in baybayin were written in a continuous flow, and the only form of punctuation was a single vertical or slanted line ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1735}}'''), or more often, a pair of vertical or slanted lines ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1736}}'''). These lines (similar to [[danda]] signs in other Indic abugidas) fulfill the function of a comma, period, or unpredictably separate sets of words.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\n==Usage==\n\n====Pre-colonial and colonial usage====\nBaybayin historically was used in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and to a lesser extent [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] speaking areas. Its use spread to [[Ilokano language|Ilokanos]] when the Spanish promoted its use with the printing of Bibles. Related scripts, such as [[Hanunoo script|Hanun\u00f3o]], [[Buhid script|Buhid]], and [[Tagbanwa alphabet|Tagbanwa]] are still used today, along with the [[Kulitan alphabet]].\nAmong the earliest literature on the orthography of [[Visayan languages]] were those of Jesuit priest Ezguerra with his {{lang|es|Arte de la lengua bisaya}} in 1747<ref>{{cite book\n| title      = Arte de la lengua bisaya de la provincia de Leyte\n| author     = P.

However, when the Spaniards succeeded in colonizing the islands, they abolished the practice and burned all documents they captured from the natives while forcefully establishing a Roman Catholic-based rule. Records on Philippine seals were forgotten until in the 1970s when actual ancient seals made of ivory were found in an archaeological site in [[Butuan]]. The seal, now known as the [[Butuan Ivory Seal]], has been declared as a National Cultural Treasure. The seal is inscribed with the word \"Butwan\" through a native ''baybayin'' script. The discovery of the seal proved the theory that pre-colonial Filipinos, or at least in coastal areas, used seals on paper. Before the discovery of the seal, it was only thought that ancient Filipinos used bamboo, metal, bark, and leaves for writing. The presence of paper documents in the classical era of the Philippines is also backed by a research of Otley Beyer stating that Spanish friars 'boasted' about burning ancient Philippine documents with ''baybayin'' inscriptions, one of the reasons why ancient documents from the Philippines are almost non-existent in present time. The ivory seal is now housed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]]. Nowadays, younger generations are trying to revive the usage of seals, notably in signing pieces of art such as drawings, paintings, and literary works.<ref name=\"NMPHseal\">[http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Seal.html Nation Museum Collections Seals]</ref>\n\n===Modern Usage===\n[[File:Gawad Lakandula.png|thumb|150px|The insignia of the [[Order of Lakandula]] contains an inscription with Baybayin characters represents the name ''[[Lakandula]]'', read counterclockwise from the top.]]\nIt is used in the most current [[Banknotes of the Philippine peso#New Generation Currency series (current)|New Generation Currency series of the Philippine peso]] issued in the last quarter of 2010.
