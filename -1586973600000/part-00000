Fellows''' (July 29, 1832 \u2013 December 7, 1896) was an American lawyer and politician from [[Arkansas]] and [[New York (state)|New York]].  He served as [[New York County District Attorney]] (1888-1890, 1894-1896), and a member of Congress from New York (1891-1893).\n\n==Life==\nHe was the son of Tisdale Eddy Fellows (1800\u20131874), farmer, and later Superintendent of the [[Halfmoon, New York|Halfmoon]] Cemetery, and Eliza (Harris) Fellows (1809\u20131867). The family moved to a farm in [[Stillwater (town), New York|Stillwater]]<ref>Sources give \"in\" or \"near\" [[Mechanicville, New York]], but this village was incorporated in 1859 from an area belonging to the Town of Stillwater at the time Fellows lived there. Stillwater was his father's birthplace, other family members are registered as having died at Mechanicville after the 1860s.</ref> (a part which is now in the city of [[Mechanicville, New York|Mechanicville]]. New York) in [[Saratoga County, New York]], where he attended the country schools. Among his playmates was [[Elmer E. Ellsworth]].\n\nIn 1850, Fellows went to [[Camden, Arkansas|Camden]], [[Ouachita County, Arkansas]], to live with his uncle. There he studied law and was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] in 1855. At one time he practiced law in partnership with [[Walter L. Bragg]].\n\nHe ran for [[presidential elector]] on the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union]] ticket of [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|Bell]] and [[Edward Everett|Everett]] in [[1860 United States presidential election|1860]], but [[Arkansas]] was carried by [[John C. Breckinridge]]. He was a delegate to the State [[Ordinance of Secession|secession convention]] in 1861.\n\nHe enlisted in the [[1st Arkansas Infantry]] of the [[Confederate States Army]]. After the [[Battle of Shiloh]], he was made a [[colonel]] and assigned to staff duties as assistant adjutant to Gen. [[William Beall]]. Later he was [[Inspector general#United States|inspector general]] at [[Port Hudson, Louisiana]], and was captured there on July 9, 1863. He was kept a prisoner of war until the end of the [[American Civil War]], and released on June 10, 1865. Afterwards he resumed the practice of law in Camden. He was a member of the [[Arkansas Senate]] from 1866 to 1867. On July 4, 1867, he married Lizzie Reynolds, and they had six children.\n\nHe was a delegate to the [[1868 Democratic National Convention]], held at the new [[Tammany Hall]] building in [[New York City]], and was noticed by Tammany boss [[William M. Tweed]] as an eloquent campaign speaker. Urged by Tweed, Fellows removed to New York City to continue the practice of law there and to campaign for the Tammany organization.\n\nTweed secured Fellows's appointment in 1868 by Corporation Counsel Richard O'Gorman (1821\u20131895) as Assistant C.C., and in 1869, D.A. [[Samuel B. Garvin]] appointed Fellows an Assistant [[New York County District Attorney]]. He remained in this office until the end of 1872 when Garvin's term expired and a Republican D.A. succeeded. After the fall of Tweed, Fellows left Tammany and joined the Anti-Tammany Democrats in New York City, at times known as the \"Young Democracy\", the \"County Democracy\" and \"Irving Hall\".\n\nFellows was re-appointed Assistant D.A. in 1882 by D.A. [[John McKeon]], and remained on this post under [[John Vincent (lawyer)|John Vincent]], [[Wheeler H. Peckham]], [[Peter B. Olney]] and [[Randolph B. Martine]]. Fellows was elected on the Tammany and County Democracy tickets D.A. in November 1887, defeating his fellow Assistant D.A. [[De Lancey Nicoll]] who was a Democrat but ran on the Republican ticket. During the fiercely fought election campaign, two letters Fellows had written to Boss Tweed on February 1, 1873, asking for a loan of $523, were published in the ''[[New York Times]]'', with the comment that this was the payment for Fellows's service in having the jury disagree on a verdict against Tweed on the previous day, and that the \"loan\" was never paid back. Fellows was D.A. from 1888 to 1890, but did not run for re-election in November 1890, preferring to rejoin Tammany Hall and to run for Congress instead. Nicoll was then elected on the Tammany ticket to succeed as D.A.\n\nFellows was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the [[52nd United States Congress|52nd]] and [[53rd United States Congress]]es, serving from March 4, 1891, until his resignation, effective December 31, 1893.\n\nHe was again elected on the Tammany ticket New York County D.A., and took office on January 1, 1894. He had been a delegate to all Democratic National Conventions from 1868 on. He also was a delegate to the [[1896 Democratic National Convention]] but repudiated [[William Jennings Bryan]], the Democratic candidate nominated on a [[Free Silver]] platform and joined the \"Gold Democrats\". In September 1896, he was a delegate to the [[National Democratic Party (United States)|National Democratic]] Convention in [[Indianapolis]] which nominated the [[John M. Palmer (politician)|Palmer]] - [[Simon Bolivar Buckner|Buckner]] ticket for the [[1896 United States presidential election]].\n\nFellows died on December 7, 1896, at his home at 610, West 152nd Street in [[New York City]] from [[stomach cancer]]; and was buried at the [[Trinity Church Cemetery]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{CongBio|F000067}}\n*[http://www.couchgenweb.com/civilwar/1infcoc.html Civil War info]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080509134551/http://www.civilwar.nps.gov/cwss/soldiers.cfm Civil War Soldiers and Sailors System] at the [[National Park Service]]\n*[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1887/11/05/106185860.pdf ''FAC SIMILES OF JOHN R.

He was a graduate of [[Case Western Reserve University|Case School of Applied Science]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].  He was a prolific inventor of chemical processes, compounds, and products, and was a successful businessman.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n===Early years===\nHerbert Henry Dow was born in 1866 in [[Belleville, Ontario]], the eldest child of Americans Joseph Henry Dow, an inventor and mechanical engineer, and his wife, Sarah Bunnell, who were from [[Derby, Connecticut]]. When the infant boy was six weeks old, the family returned to their hometown.<ref name=\"ohiohistory\">{{cite web| title =Herbert H Dow| publisher =Ohio History Center| url =http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=109| accessdate =April 5, 2007| url-status =live| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070830202741/http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=109| archivedate =August 30, 2007| df =mdy-all}}</ref>  They moved again in 1878, this time to [[Cleveland]] to follow Joseph's job with the Derby Shovel Manufacturing Company.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1884, Dow enrolled in the [[Case Western Reserve University|Case School of Applied Science]] (now known as [[Case Western Reserve University]]).  While at Case, he became a member of the [[Phi Kappa Psi]] fraternity.  He began specialized research into the chemical composition of [[brine]]s in [[Ohio]] and nearby areas.  He discovered that brine samples from [[Canton, Ohio]] and [[Midland, Michigan]] were very rich in [[bromine]], which at the time was a primary ingredient in medicines and was widely used in the fledgeling photographic industry.<ref name=\"Profile\">{{cite web|title=Herbert Henry Dow|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/herbert-henry-dow|website=Science History Institute |accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref> Following his graduation from Case in 1888, Dow worked for a year as a chemistry professor at Huron Street Hospital College in Cleveland, while continuing his research into the extraction of chemicals from brine.\n\n===Business career===\nIn 1889 Dow received his first patent after inventing a more cost-effective and streamlined process for bromine extraction.  He quickly formed his own company but was bankrupt within the year.  His associates were impressed with his work and in 1890 helped him to found the Midland Chemical Company in Midland, Michigan.<ref name=\"ohiohistory\"/>  Dow continued his work extracting bromine, and by early 1891 he had invented the [[Dow process]], a method of bromine extraction using [[electrolysis]] to oxidize bromide to bromine.<ref name=\"Profile\"/>\n\n==== Foundation of Dow Chemical ====\nDow wanted to expand his research of electrolysis to yield other chemicals.  His financial backers did not approve of his continued research and fired him from the Midland Chemical Company.<ref name=\"Growth Company\">{{cite book|last= Brandt|first= E.

Pardee, Albert W. Smith, J. H. Osborn, and [[Cady Staley]].  In 1895, Dow moved his young family to Ohio and founded the Dow Process Company to develop the production mechanism for his process.<ref name=\"The Dow Story\">{{cite book |last= Whitehead|first= Don|title= The Dow Story: The History of the Dow Chemical Company |url= https://archive.org/details/dowstoryhistoryo00whit|url-access= registration|edition= 1st|year= 1968|publisher= McGraw-Hill Book Co.|id=|pages= [https://archive.org/details/dowstoryhistoryo00whit/page/24 24], 37\u201338 |isbn= 978-0-07-069948-9 |lccn= 68023570 }}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}|</ref>  The following year he returned to Midland, where he formed the [[Dow Chemical Company]] as successor to the Dow Process Company.

Dow Papers, Post Street Archives, Midland, Michigan</ref>  Within three years, his new company purchased the Midland Chemical Company.<ref name=\"Profile\"/>\n\n==== Breaking a monopoly ====\nWith his new company and new technology, Dow produced bromine very cheaply, and began selling it in the United States for 36 cents per pound. At the time, the German government supported a bromine [[cartel]], Bromkonvention, which had a near-[[monopoly]] on the supply of bromine, which they sold in the US for 49 cents per pound. The Germans had made it clear that they would [[dumping (pricing policy)|dump the market]] with cheap bromine if Dow attempted to sell his product abroad. In 1904 Dow defied the cartel by beginning to export his bromine at its cheaper price to England. A few months later, an angry Bromkonvention representative visited Dow in his office and reminded him to cease exporting his bromine.<ref name=\"monopoly\">{{cite web  | last = Folsom  | first = Burton W.  | title = Herbert Dow, the Monopoly Breaker  | publisher = Mackinac Center for Public Policy  | date = May 1, 1997  | url = http://www.mackinac.org/article.aspx?ID=31  | accessdate = April 5, 2007  | url-status = live  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070304002347/http://www.mackinac.org/article.aspx?ID=31  | archivedate = March 4, 2007  | df = mdy-all  }}</ref>\n\nUnafraid, Dow continued exporting to England and Japan. The German cartel retaliated by dumping the US market with bromine at 15 cents a pound in an effort to put him out of business. Unable to compete with this [[predatory pricing]] in the U.S., Dow instructed his agents to buy up hundreds of thousands of pounds of the German bromine locally at the low price. The Dow company repackaged the bromine and exported it to Europe, selling it even to German companies at 27 cents a pound. The cartel, having expected Dow to go out of business, was unable to comprehend what was driving the enormous demand for bromine in the U.S., and where all the cheap imported bromine dumping their market was coming from. They suspected their own members of violating their price-fixing agreement and selling in Germany below the cartel's fixed cost. The cartel continued to slash prices on their bromine in the U.S., first to  12 cents a pound, and then to 10.5 cents per pound. The cartel finally caught on to Dow's tactic and realized that they could not keep selling below cost, they then increased their prices worldwide.<ref name=\"monopoly\"/>\n\n==== World War I ====\nDow Chemical Company focused on research, and soon was able to extract many more chemicals from brine. [[World War I]] provided demand that enabled its growth, because Britain blockaded the ports of Germany, which at the time included most of the world's largest chemical suppliers.  Dow Chemical quickly moved to fill the gap for wartime goods, producing [[magnesium]] for incendiary flares, [[Chlorobenzene|monochlorobenzene]] and [[phenol]] for explosives, and bromine for medicines and tear gas.  By 1918, 90% of the Dow Chemical Company production was in support of the war effort.<ref name=\"Profile\"/>  During this time period, Dow also created the diamond logo, which is still used by the Dow Chemical Company.<ref name=\"walkoffame\">{{cite web|title=Herbert Henry Dow |publisher=Michigan Walk of Fame |url=http://www.michiganwalkoffame.com/dow.asp |accessdate=April 5, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061103134319/http://www.michiganwalkoffame.com/dow.asp |archivedate=November 3, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n====Auto industry====\nFollowing the conclusion of the war, Dow began to research the benefits of magnesium, which the company had in large supply.  He discovered that it could be used to make automobile pistons.  The new pistons proved to give more speed and better fuel efficiency.  The Dowmetal pistons were used heavily in racing vehicles, and the 1921 winner of the [[Indianapolis 500]] used the Dowmetal pistons in his vehicle.<ref name=\"Profile\"/>\n\n===Death===\nBy the time of his death on October 15, 1930 from [[cirrhosis]] of the liver,<ref name=\"Profile\"/>  Dow had personally received over 90 patents.<ref name=\"inventnow\">{{cite web|title=Herbert Henry Dow |publisher=Invent Now |url=http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/45.html |accessdate=April 5, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421011844/http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/45.html |archivedate=April 21, 2007 }}</ref>  Dow was survived by his wife, [[Grace A.

He was a prolific inventor of chemical processes, compounds, and products, and was a successful businessman.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n===Early years===\nHerbert Henry Dow was born in 1866 in [[Belleville, Ontario]], the eldest child of Americans Joseph Henry Dow, an inventor and mechanical engineer, and his wife, Sarah Bunnell, who were from [[Derby, Connecticut]]. When the infant boy was six weeks old, the family returned to their hometown.<ref name=\"ohiohistory\">{{cite web| title =Herbert H Dow| publisher =Ohio History Center| url =http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=109| accessdate =April 5, 2007| url-status =live| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070830202741/http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=109| archivedate =August 30, 2007| df =mdy-all}}</ref>  They moved again in 1878, this time to [[Cleveland]] to follow Joseph's job with the Derby Shovel Manufacturing Company.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1884, Dow enrolled in the [[Case Western Reserve University|Case School of Applied Science]] (now known as [[Case Western Reserve University]]).  While at Case, he became a member of the [[Phi Kappa Psi]] fraternity.  He began specialized research into the chemical composition of [[brine]]s in [[Ohio]] and nearby areas.  He discovered that brine samples from [[Canton, Ohio]] and [[Midland, Michigan]] were very rich in [[bromine]], which at the time was a primary ingredient in medicines and was widely used in the fledgeling photographic industry.<ref name=\"Profile\">{{cite web|title=Herbert Henry Dow|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/herbert-henry-dow|website=Science History Institute |accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref> Following his graduation from Case in 1888, Dow worked for a year as a chemistry professor at Huron Street Hospital College in Cleveland, while continuing his research into the extraction of chemicals from brine.\n\n===Business career===\nIn 1889 Dow received his first patent after inventing a more cost-effective and streamlined process for bromine extraction.  He quickly formed his own company but was bankrupt within the year.  His associates were impressed with his work and in 1890 helped him to found the Midland Chemical Company in Midland, Michigan.<ref name=\"ohiohistory\"/>  Dow continued his work extracting bromine, and by early 1891 he had invented the [[Dow process]], a method of bromine extraction using [[electrolysis]] to oxidize bromide to bromine.<ref name=\"Profile\"/>\n\n==== Foundation of Dow Chemical ====\nDow wanted to expand his research of electrolysis to yield other chemicals.  His financial backers did not approve of his continued research and fired him from the Midland Chemical Company.<ref name=\"Growth Company\">{{cite book|last= Brandt|first= E.

Pardee, Albert W. Smith, J. H. Osborn, and [[Cady Staley]].  In 1895, Dow moved his young family to Ohio and founded the Dow Process Company to develop the production mechanism for his process.<ref name=\"The Dow Story\">{{cite book |last= Whitehead|first= Don|title= The Dow Story: The History of the Dow Chemical Company |url= https://archive.org/details/dowstoryhistoryo00whit|url-access= registration|edition= 1st|year= 1968|publisher= McGraw-Hill Book Co.|id=|pages= [https://archive.org/details/dowstoryhistoryo00whit/page/24 24], 37\u201338 |isbn= 978-0-07-069948-9 |lccn= 68023570 }}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}|</ref>  The following year he returned to Midland, where he formed the [[Dow Chemical Company]] as successor to the Dow Process Company. The Dow Process Company was incorporated with 57 original stockholders.<ref name=stock>\"Original Stockholder Agreement of Dow Chemical Company,\" 1897, File # 970041, Herbert H. Dow Papers, Post Street Archives, Midland, Michigan</ref>  Within three years, his new company purchased the Midland Chemical Company.<ref name=\"Profile\"/>\n\n==== Breaking a monopoly ====\nWith his new company and new technology, Dow produced bromine very cheaply, and began selling it in the United States for 36 cents per pound. At the time, the German government supported a bromine [[cartel]], Bromkonvention, which had a near-[[monopoly]] on the supply of bromine, which they sold in the US for 49 cents per pound. The Germans had made it clear that they would [[dumping (pricing policy)|dump the market]] with cheap bromine if Dow attempted to sell his product abroad. In 1904 Dow defied the cartel by beginning to export his bromine at its cheaper price to England. A few months later, an angry Bromkonvention representative visited Dow in his office and reminded him to cease exporting his bromine.<ref name=\"monopoly\">{{cite web  | last = Folsom  | first = Burton W.  | title = Herbert Dow, the Monopoly Breaker  | publisher = Mackinac Center for Public Policy  | date = May 1, 1997  | url = http://www.mackinac.org/article.aspx?ID=31  | accessdate = April 5, 2007  | url-status = live  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070304002347/http://www.mackinac.org/article.aspx?ID=31  | archivedate = March 4, 2007  | df = mdy-all  }}</ref>\n\nUnafraid, Dow continued exporting to England and Japan. The German cartel retaliated by dumping the US market with bromine at 15 cents a pound in an effort to put him out of business. Unable to compete with this [[predatory pricing]] in the U.S., Dow instructed his agents to buy up hundreds of thousands of pounds of the German bromine locally at the low price. The Dow company repackaged the bromine and exported it to Europe, selling it even to German companies at 27 cents a pound. The cartel, having expected Dow to go out of business, was unable to comprehend what was driving the enormous demand for bromine in the U.S., and where all the cheap imported bromine dumping their market was coming from. They suspected their own members of violating their price-fixing agreement and selling in Germany below the cartel's fixed cost. The cartel continued to slash prices on their bromine in the U.S., first to  12 cents a pound, and then to 10.5 cents per pound. The cartel finally caught on to Dow's tactic and realized that they could not keep selling below cost, they then increased their prices worldwide.<ref name=\"monopoly\"/>\n\n==== World War I ====\nDow Chemical Company focused on research, and soon was able to extract many more chemicals from brine. [[World War I]] provided demand that enabled its growth, because Britain blockaded the ports of Germany, which at the time included most of the world's largest chemical suppliers.  Dow Chemical quickly moved to fill the gap for wartime goods, producing [[magnesium]] for incendiary flares, [[Chlorobenzene|monochlorobenzene]] and [[phenol]] for explosives, and bromine for medicines and tear gas.  By 1918, 90% of the Dow Chemical Company production was in support of the war effort.<ref name=\"Profile\"/>  During this time period, Dow also created the diamond logo, which is still used by the Dow Chemical Company.<ref name=\"walkoffame\">{{cite web|title=Herbert Henry Dow |publisher=Michigan Walk of Fame |url=http://www.michiganwalkoffame.com/dow.asp |accessdate=April 5, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061103134319/http://www.michiganwalkoffame.com/dow.asp |archivedate=November 3, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n====Auto industry====\nFollowing the conclusion of the war, Dow began to research the benefits of magnesium, which the company had in large supply.  He discovered that it could be used to make automobile pistons.  The new pistons proved to give more speed and better fuel efficiency.  The Dowmetal pistons were used heavily in racing vehicles, and the 1921 winner of the [[Indianapolis 500]] used the Dowmetal pistons in his vehicle.<ref name=\"Profile\"/>\n\n===Death===\nBy the time of his death on October 15, 1930 from [[cirrhosis]] of the liver,<ref name=\"Profile\"/>  Dow had personally received over 90 patents.<ref name=\"inventnow\">{{cite web|title=Herbert Henry Dow |publisher=Invent Now |url=http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/45.html |accessdate=April 5, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421011844/http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/45.html |archivedate=April 21, 2007 }}</ref>  Dow was survived by his wife, [[Grace A.

ISSN 0016-7606.</ref> which makes it the deepest lake in the United States, the second-deepest in North America and the [[list of lakes by depth|ninth-deepest]] in the world.<ref name=\"deepest\"/> Crater Lake is often referred to as the seventh-deepest lake in the world, but this former listing excludes the approximately {{convert|3000|ft|m|adj=on}} depth of subglacial [[Lake Vostok]] in Antarctica, which resides under nearly {{convert|13000|ft|m}} of ice, and the recent report of a {{convert|2740|ft|m|adj=on}} maximum depth for [[Lake O'Higgins]]/San Martin, located on the border of Chile and Argentina.  However, when comparing its average depth of {{convert|1148|ft|m}} to the average depth of other deep lakes, Crater Lake becomes the deepest in the Western Hemisphere and the third-deepest in the world.  The impressive average depth of this volcanic lake is due to the nearly symmetrical {{convert|4000|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} caldera formed 7,700 years ago during the violent climactic eruptions and subsequent collapse of Mount Mazama and the relatively moist climate that is typical of the crest of the [[Cascade Range]].\n\nThe caldera rim ranges in elevation from {{convert|7000|to|8000|ft}}.  The [[United States Geological Survey]] benchmarked elevation of the lake surface is {{convert|6178|ft}}. The national park encompasses {{convert|183224|acre|sqmi km2|1|sigfig=5}}.<ref name=\"area\"/>  Crater Lake has no streams flowing into or out of it. All water that enters the lake is eventually lost from evaporation or subsurface seepage. The lake's water commonly has a striking blue hue, and the lake is refilled entirely from direct precipitation in the form of snow and rain.\n\n==Geology==\n{{Details|Mount Mazama}}\n[[File:Crater Lake ISS (rotated and cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Satellite view of Crater Lake]]\nVolcanic activity in this area is fed by [[subduction]] off the coast of Oregon as the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]] slips below the [[North American Plate]] (see [[plate tectonics]]). Heat and compression generated by this movement has created a [[mountain chain]] topped by a series of volcanoes, which together are called the [[Cascade Range]].  The large volcanoes in the range are called the High Cascades. However, there are many other volcanoes in the range as well, most of which are much smaller.\n\nAbout 400,000 years ago, [[Mount Mazama]] began its existence in much the same way as the other mountains of the High Cascades, as overlapping [[shield volcano]]es. Over time, alternating layers of [[lava]] flows and [[pyroclastic flow]]s built Mazama's overlapping cones until it reached about {{convert|11000|ft}} in height.\n\n[[File:Relief map of Crater Lake area.jpg|thumb|Relief map of Crater Lake area]]\nAs the young [[stratovolcano]] grew, many smaller volcanoes and volcanic vents were built in the area of the park and just outside what are now the park's borders. Chief among these were [[volcanic cone#Cinder cone|cinder cones]]. Although the early examples are gone\u2014cinder cones [[Erosion|erode]] easily\u2014there are at least 13 much younger cinder cones in the park, and at least another 11 or so outside its borders, that still retain their distinctive cinder cone appearance. There continues to be debate as to whether these minor volcanoes and vents were parasitic to Mazama's [[magma chamber]] and system or if they were related to background Oregon Cascade volcanism.\n\nAfter a period of dormancy, Mazama became active again. Then, around 5700 BC, Mazama collapsed into itself during a tremendous [[volcanic eruption]], losing {{convert|2500|to|3500|ft}} in height. The eruption formed a large [[caldera]] that, depending on the prevailing climate, was filled in about 740 years, forming a beautiful lake with a deep blue hue, known today as [[Crater Lake]].<ref>\n  {{cite journal\n  | author = Manuel Nathenson\n  |author2=Charles R.

It produced more than 150 times as much ash as the May 18, [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens]].\n\nThis ash has since developed a [[soil]] type called [[andisol]]. Soils in Crater Lake National Park are brown, dark brown or dark grayish-brown sandy loams or loamy sands which have plentiful cobbles, gravel and stones. They are slightly to moderately acidic and their drainage is somewhat excessive.\n\n\n[[File:Crater Lake winter pano.jpg|thumb|320px|November panoroma from [[Rim Village Historic District|Rim Village]]. During the winter, the road up to Rim Village is normally plowed but [[Rim Drive]] is closed.]]\n\n==Climate==\n\nAccording to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system, Crater Lake National Park has a Continental Subarctic - Cold Dry Summer (\u2018\u2019Dsc\u2019\u2019). The [[plant hardiness zone]] at the lake is 6b with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of -3.7&nbsp;\u00b0F (-19.8&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref name=\"USDA\">{{cite web|url=https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/InteractiveMap.aspx|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|accessdate=2019-07-03|title=USDA Interactive Plant Hardiness Map}}</ref>\n\nSnow is relatively rare at low elevations in western Oregon, but it is common at higher elevations, especially at Crater Lake. Measurements at park headquarters, {{convert|6475|ft|m}} above sea level, show that snow falls more often here than at any other long-term weather station in Oregon. Winter, which typically begins at the park in September and runs through June, includes an average of 98 days with measurable snowfall. Up to {{convert|37|in|cm}} of snow have fallen on the park in a single day (in 1937, 1951, and 1971), {{convert|313|in|cm}} in a month (January 1950), and {{convert|903|in|cm}} in a year (1950).<ref name=\"Taylor 39-41\">Taylor and Hannan, pp. 39\u201341</ref>\n\nSnow typically accumulates in the park to depths of {{convert|10|to|15|ft|m}} by early spring. Most of the park's roads remain closed through late spring, and snow lingers into the summer. In July and August, snowfall is uncommon, and \"one magnificent day typically follows another\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Plan Your Visit|url=http://www.nps.gov/crla/planyourvisit/index.htm|publisher=National Park Service|year=2011|accessdate=November 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\nJanuary is the coldest month, when highs average about {{convert|35|F|C}} and lows average about {{convert|18|F|C}}.<ref name=\"Taylor 24\">Taylor and Hannan, p. 24</ref> August is the warmest month, with an average high of roughly {{convert|69|F|C}} and an average low of about {{convert|40|F|C}}.<ref name=\"Taylor 24\"/> Between 1962 and 1990, the highest recorded temperature was {{convert|90|F|C}}, and the lowest was {{convert|-21|F|C}}.<ref>Taylor and Hannan, p. 118</ref> Annual precipitation averages about {{convert|66|in|mm}} a year.<ref name=\"Taylor 11\">Taylor and Hannan, p. 11</ref> December is the wettest, averaging about {{convert|11|in|mm}}.<ref name=\"Taylor 11\"/>\n\nAlthough snow covers Crater Lake National Park for eight months of the year (average annual snowfall is {{convert|533|in|cm}}), the lake rarely freezes over due in part to a relatively mild onshore flow from the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The last recorded year in which the lake froze over was in 1949, a very long, cold winter. A 95% surface freeze occurred in 1985. The immense depth of Crater Lake acts as a heat reservoir that absorbs and traps sunlight, maintaining the lake temperature at an average of {{convert|55|F}} on the surface and {{convert|38|F}} at the bottom throughout the year. The surface temperature fluctuates a bit, but the bottom temperature remains quite constant.\n\n{{Weather box |width=auto\n|location = Crater Lake (1981\u20132010 normals)\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan high F = 34.6\n|Feb high F = 35.1\n|Mar high F = 37.5\n|Apr high F = 41.7\n|May high F = 49.4\n|Jun high F = 57.9\n|Jul high F = 68.8\n|Aug high F = 69.7 \n|Sep high F = 63.2\n|Oct high F = 52.1\n|Nov high F = 38.2\n|Dec high F = 34.0\n|Jan low F = 19.0\n|Feb low F = 18.5 \n|Mar low F = 19.8\n|Apr low F = 23.0\n|May low F = 28.3\n|Jun low F = 33.3\n|Jul low F = 40.5\n|Aug low F = 40.6 \n|Sep low F = 36.2\n|Oct low F = 30.1\n|Nov low F = 22.6\n|Dec low F = 18.8\n|Jan precipitation inch = 9.32\n|Feb precipitation inch = 7.75\n|Mar precipitation inch = 7.48\n|Apr precipitation inch = 5.37\n|May precipitation inch = 3.55\n|Jun precipitation inch = 2.22 \n|Jul precipitation inch = 1.02 \n|Aug precipitation inch = 1.00\n|Sep precipitation inch = 1.85\n|Oct precipitation inch = 4.44\n|Nov precipitation inch = 10.29\n|Dec precipitation inch = 11.41\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan snow inch = 85.5\n|Feb snow inch = 73.8\n|Mar snow inch = 73.4\n|Apr snow inch = 48.8\n|May snow inch = 17.4\n|Jun snow inch = 4.1\n|Jul snow inch = 0.2\n|Aug snow inch = 0\n|Sep snow inch = 3.1\n|Oct snow inch = 17.3\n|Nov snow inch = 71.1\n|Dec snow inch = 92.7\n|unit precipitation days = 0.01 in\n|unit snow days = 0.1 in\n|Jan precipitation days = 17.9\n|Feb precipitation days = 15.9\n|Mar precipitation days = 18.1\n|Apr precipitation days = 15.5\n|May precipitation days = 11.2\n|Jun precipitation days = 8.1\n|Jul precipitation days = 3.9\n|Aug precipitation days = 4.0\n|Sep precipitation days = 5.8\n|Oct precipitation days = 9.8\n|Nov precipitation days = 17.5\n|Dec precipitation days = 18.0\n|Jan snow days = 15.9\n|Feb snow days = 14.3\n|Mar snow days = 16.1\n|Apr snow days = 12.6\n|May snow days = 6.0\n|Jun snow days = 2.0  \n|Jul snow days = 0.2\n|Aug snow days = 0.1\n|Sep snow days = 1.0\n|Oct snow days = 4.7\n|Nov snow days = 13.2\n|Dec snow days = 16.4\n|source 1 = NOAA <ref name = NOAA >\n{{cite web\n  |url = http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=mfr\n  |title = NowData&nbsp;\u2013 NOAA Online Weather Data\n  |publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n  |accessdate = 2012-05-26}}</ref>\n|date=March 2012\n}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Fauna==\nMammals that are residents of this national park are [[Canada lynx|Canadian lynxes]], [[bobcat]]s, [[North American beaver|beavers]], [[chipmunk]]s, [[pronghorn]]s, [[fox]]es, [[squirrel]]s, [[North American porcupine|porcupines]], [[American black bear|black bears]], [[coyote]]s, [[American pika|pika]], [[American badger|badger]]s, [[deer]], [[Rocky Mountain elk|elk]], [[muskrat]]s, and [[American marten|martens]].

Even after thousands of years, this area is largely devoid of plants due to excessive porosity (meaning water drains through quickly) and poor soil composed primarily of [[regolith]].\n* The Pinnacles: When the very hot ash and pumice came to rest near the volcano, it formed {{convert|200|to|300|ft|-1|adj=mid|-thick}} gas-charged deposits. For perhaps years afterward, hot gas moved to the surface and slowly cemented ash and pumice together in channels and escaped through [[fumarole]]s. [[Erosion]] later removed most of the surrounding loose ash and pumice, leaving tall pinnacles and spires.\n\n;Other park features:\n* [[Mount Scott (Klamath County, Oregon)|Mount Scott]] is a steep [[andesite|andesitic]] cone whose [[lava]] came from [[magma]] from Mazama's [[magma chamber]]; geologists call such volcano a [[parasitic cone|parasitic]] or satellite cone. Volcanic eruptions apparently ceased on Scott sometime before the end of the [[Pleistocene]]; one remaining large [[cirque (landform)|cirque]] on Scott's northwest side was left unmodified by post-[[ice age|ice-age]] volcanism.\n* In the southwest corner of the park stands [[Union Peak]], an extinct volcano whose primary remains consist of a large volcanic plug, which is lava that solidified in the volcano's neck.\n* Crater Peak is a [[shield volcano]] primarily made of andesite and [[basalt]] lava flows topped by andesitic and [[dacite]] tephra.\n* Timber Crater is a shield volcano located in the northeast corner of the park. Like Crater Peak, it is made of basaltic and andesitic lava flows but, unlike Crater, it is topped by two cinder cones.\n* [[Rim Drive]] is the most popular road in the park; it follows a scenic route around the caldera rim.\n* Llao Rock on the north side rises {{convert|1800|ft}} above the lake, with a {{convert|1.3|mi|km|adj=mid}} trail from Rim Drive leading to the summit.<ref>{{cite news|last=Richard|first=Terry|title=Llao Rock offers unsurpassed first-time viewing opportunity of Crater Lake|url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/terryrichard/2011/09/llao_rock_offers_unsurpassed_f.html|accessdate=January 8, 2012|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=September 14, 2011}}</ref>\n* The [[Pacific Crest Trail]], a {{convert|2650|mi|adj=mid}} long-distance hiking and equestrian trail that stretches from the Mexican to Canadian borders, passes through the park.\n* [[Old-growth forest]]s covering {{convert|50000|acre|sqmi km2|1}}.<ref name = \"1993OldGrowthEstimates\">{{Cite journal\n  | last1 = Bolsinger | first1 = Charles L.\n  | last2 = Waddell | first2 = Karen L.\n  | year = 1993\n  | title = Area of old-growth forests in California, Oregon, and Washington\n  | url = http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/pnw_rb197.pdf\n  | publisher = [[United States Forest Service]], Pacific Northwest Research Station\n  | id = Resource Bulletin PNW-RB-197\n  | accessdate = {{date|2012-03-14|mdy}}\n}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n{{Wide image|Craterlake-panorama.jpg|1778px|180-degree panoramic photograph of Crater Lake from the top of nearby [[Mount Scott (Klamath County, Oregon)|Mount Scott]], looking west.

One ancient legend of the [[Klamath people]] closely parallels the geologic story which emerges from today's scientific research. The legend tells of two Chiefs, [[Llao]] of the Below World and [[Skell]] of the Above World, pitted in a battle which ended up in the destruction of Llao's home, Mt. Mazama.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/crla/New%20Folder/crlacr.htm | title = Park History | publisher = National Park Service | accessdate={{date|2010-10-18|mdy}}}}</ref> The battle was witnessed in the eruption of Mt. Mazama and the creation of Crater Lake.\n\nA trio of [[gold]] prospectors: [[John Wesley Hillman]], Henry Klippel, and Isaac Skeeters were the first white people to visit the lake. On June 12, 1853, they stumbled upon the long, sloping mountain while hunting for provisions. Stunned by vibrant blue color of the lake, they named the [[indigo]] body of water \"Deep Blue Lake\" and the place on the southwest side of the rim where he first saw the lake later became known as Discovery Point.<ref name=\"nps\"/>  But gold was more on the minds of settlers at the time and the discovery was soon forgotten. The suggested name later fell out of favor by locals, who preferred the name ''Crater Lake''.\n\n[[William Gladstone Steel]] devoted his life and fortune to the establishment and management of a national park at Crater Lake. His preoccupation with the lake began in 1870. In his efforts to bring recognition to the park, he participated in lake surveys that provided scientific support. He named many of the lake's landmarks, including [[Wizard Island]], Llao Rock, and Skell Head.\n\nWith the help of geologist Clarence Dutton, Steel organized a USGS expedition to study the lake in 1886. The party carried the ''Cleetwood'', a half-ton survey boat, up the steep slopes of the mountain then lowered it to the lake. From the stern of the ''Cleetwood'', a piece of pipe on the end of a spool of [[piano wire]] sounded the depth of the lake at 168 different points.  Their deepest sounding, {{convert|1996|ft}}, was very close to the modern official depth of {{convert|1949|ft}} made in 2000 by [[sonar]].<ref name=\"deepest\"/>  At the same time, a [[topography|topographer]] surveyed the area and created the first professional [[map]] of the Crater Lake area.\n[[File:Crater Lake Lodge Rim Village Historic District.jpg|thumb|[[Crater Lake Lodge]]]]\nPartly based on data from the expedition and lobbying from Steel and others, Crater Lake National Park was established May 22, 1902 by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. And because of Steel's involvement, [[Crater Lake Lodge]] was opened in 1915 and the Rim Drive was completed in 1918.<ref name=\"nps\" />\n\n[[Highway]]s were later built to the park to help facilitate tourism. The 1929 edition of ''[[O Ranger!]]'' described access and facilities available by then:\n<blockquote>Crater Lake National Park is reached by train on the Southern Pacific Railroad lines into Medford and Klamath Falls, at which stops motor stages make the short trip to the park. A hotel on the rim of the lake offers accommodations. For the motorist, the visit to the park is a short side trip from the [[Pacific Highway (United States)|Pacific]] and [[The Dalles-California Highway|Dalles-California]] highways. He will find, in addition to the hotel, campsites, stores, filling stations. The park is open to travel from late June or July 1 for as long as snow does not block the roads, generally until October.<ref>{{cite book | first1 = Horace M. | last1 = Albright | first2 = Frank J. | last2 = Taylor | title = Oh, Ranger! | others = illustrated by Ruth Taylor White | publisher = The Chatham Press, Inc. | location = Riverside, Connecticut | edition = Centennial | url = http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/albright3/ | chapterurl = http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/albright3/chap13a.htm | accessdate = {{date|2006-08-18|mdy}} | date = {{date|2004-09-06|mdy}} | chapter = Glimpses of the National Parks and Monuments | origyear = 1928 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe lake is described in the poetry of [[Joaquin Miller]].<ref name=ea>{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Crater Lake National Park}}</ref>\n\n==Activities==\n[[Image:Daily trips CLNP.jpg|thumb|upright|Daily Trips (1931)]]\nThere are many [[hiking]] trails and several campgrounds inside the park.

Getting there requires a fairly steep {{convert|2.5|mi|adj=mid}} hike from the Rim Drive trailhead. On a clear day, visibility from the summit exceeds {{convert|100|mi}}, and one can, in a single view, take in the entire caldera. Also visible from this point are the white-peaked [[Cascade Range]] [[volcano]]es to the north, the [[Columbia River Plateau]] to the east, and the Western Cascades and the more-distant [[Klamath Mountains]] to the west.\n\nThe scenery of Crater Lake is fully accessible during the summer months. Heavy snowfalls in this park during the fall, winter, and spring months force many road and trail closures, including the popular \"Rim Drive\", which is generally completely open from July to October and partially open in some other months, such as May, June, and November.\n\n== Trails ==\n[[File:Crater Lake Watchman Trail.jpg|thumb|upright|View up to Watchman Trail and peak]]\n[[File:Crater Lake Garfield Peak Trail View East.jpg|thumb|Garfield Peak trail, view east towards Crater Lake]]\n\n===  Cleetwood Cove ===\nThe Cleetwood Cove trail originates on the north side of the lake about {{convert|4.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of North Junction along East Rim Drive. The trail is the only one that accesses the shoreline of the lake, descending {{convert|656|ft}} from the Cleetwood Cove parking lot. First opened during the summer of 1960, the trail is {{convert|1.1|mi|km|abbr=on}} long with an 11% grade that rates it as a strenuous route on the return trip. Due to its steep grade, the trail is not accessible for mobility-impaired visitors. A dock with concessionaire boats facilitates tours around the lake with a stop at Wizard Island for dropping off and picking up passengers. Swimming and fishing are permitted.

The trail ends next to a historic fire lookout tower built in 1932.<ref name=CLInst2/>\n\n=== Lightning Spring ===\nThe Lightning Spring trail starts from the Lightning Spring picnic area. It is a {{convert|3/4|mi|adj=mid}} hike with an elevation gain of {{convert|250|ft}}. The trail circles around several meadows up to the Lightning Spring creek. The trail is known for the frequent sights of grazing deer.\n\n=== Castle Crest Wildflower Garden ===\nThis is considered to be the easiest trail, looping around the Castle Crest Wildflower Garden. It starts from the East Rim Road, near the park's headquarters. It received its name because of a large stretch of meadows around which the trail circles and which is bursting with [[wildflower]]s in the springtime. The trail is about {{convert|1/2|mi|m}} before it reaches the wildflower meadow garden, from which other improvised routes depart.\n\n=== Plaikni Falls ===\nThe Plaikni Falls trail is the newest trail on the Crater Lake park. It stretches {{convert|1.1|mi}} from the trailhead located {{convert|1.2|mi}} south from the Phantom Ship Overlook on Pinnacles Road, which spins off Rim Drive. The trail leads to [[Plaikni Falls]]. Most of the trail is wheelchair-accessible.

However, when comparing its average depth of {{convert|1148|ft|m}} to the average depth of other deep lakes, Crater Lake becomes the deepest in the Western Hemisphere and the third-deepest in the world.  The impressive average depth of this volcanic lake is due to the nearly symmetrical {{convert|4000|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} caldera formed 7,700 years ago during the violent climactic eruptions and subsequent collapse of Mount Mazama and the relatively moist climate that is typical of the crest of the [[Cascade Range]].\n\nThe caldera rim ranges in elevation from {{convert|7000|to|8000|ft}}.

The lake's water commonly has a striking blue hue, and the lake is refilled entirely from direct precipitation in the form of snow and rain.\n\n==Geology==\n{{Details|Mount Mazama}}\n[[File:Crater Lake ISS (rotated and cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Satellite view of Crater Lake]]\nVolcanic activity in this area is fed by [[subduction]] off the coast of Oregon as the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]] slips below the [[North American Plate]] (see [[plate tectonics]]). Heat and compression generated by this movement has created a [[mountain chain]] topped by a series of volcanoes, which together are called the [[Cascade Range]].  The large volcanoes in the range are called the High Cascades. However, there are many other volcanoes in the range as well, most of which are much smaller.\n\nAbout 400,000 years ago, [[Mount Mazama]] began its existence in much the same way as the other mountains of the High Cascades, as overlapping [[shield volcano]]es. Over time, alternating layers of [[lava]] flows and [[pyroclastic flow]]s built Mazama's overlapping cones until it reached about {{convert|11000|ft}} in height.\n\n[[File:Relief map of Crater Lake area.jpg|thumb|Relief map of Crater Lake area]]\nAs the young [[stratovolcano]] grew, many smaller volcanoes and volcanic vents were built in the area of the park and just outside what are now the park's borders. Chief among these were [[volcanic cone#Cinder cone|cinder cones]]. Although the early examples are gone\u2014cinder cones [[Erosion|erode]] easily\u2014there are at least 13 much younger cinder cones in the park, and at least another 11 or so outside its borders, that still retain their distinctive cinder cone appearance. There continues to be debate as to whether these minor volcanoes and vents were parasitic to Mazama's [[magma chamber]] and system or if they were related to background Oregon Cascade volcanism.\n\nAfter a period of dormancy, Mazama became active again. Then, around 5700 BC, Mazama collapsed into itself during a tremendous [[volcanic eruption]], losing {{convert|2500|to|3500|ft}} in height. The eruption formed a large [[caldera]] that, depending on the prevailing climate, was filled in about 740 years, forming a beautiful lake with a deep blue hue, known today as [[Crater Lake]].<ref>\n  {{cite journal\n  | author = Manuel Nathenson\n  |author2=Charles R.

It produced more than 150 times as much ash as the May 18, [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens]].\n\nThis ash has since developed a [[soil]] type called [[andisol]]. Soils in Crater Lake National Park are brown, dark brown or dark grayish-brown sandy loams or loamy sands which have plentiful cobbles, gravel and stones. They are slightly to moderately acidic and their drainage is somewhat excessive.\n\n\n[[File:Crater Lake winter pano.jpg|thumb|320px|November panoroma from [[Rim Village Historic District|Rim Village]].

Measurements at park headquarters, {{convert|6475|ft|m}} above sea level, show that snow falls more often here than at any other long-term weather station in Oregon. Winter, which typically begins at the park in September and runs through June, includes an average of 98 days with measurable snowfall. Up to {{convert|37|in|cm}} of snow have fallen on the park in a single day (in 1937, 1951, and 1971), {{convert|313|in|cm}} in a month (January 1950), and {{convert|903|in|cm}} in a year (1950).<ref name=\"Taylor 39-41\">Taylor and Hannan, pp. 39\u201341</ref>\n\nSnow typically accumulates in the park to depths of {{convert|10|to|15|ft|m}} by early spring.

The last recorded year in which the lake froze over was in 1949, a very long, cold winter. A 95% surface freeze occurred in 1985. The immense depth of Crater Lake acts as a heat reservoir that absorbs and traps sunlight, maintaining the lake temperature at an average of {{convert|55|F}} on the surface and {{convert|38|F}} at the bottom throughout the year. The surface temperature fluctuates a bit, but the bottom temperature remains quite constant.\n\n{{Weather box |width=auto\n|location = Crater Lake (1981\u20132010 normals)\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan high F = 34.6\n|Feb high F = 35.1\n|Mar high F = 37.5\n|Apr high F = 41.7\n|May high F = 49.4\n|Jun high F = 57.9\n|Jul high F = 68.8\n|Aug high F = 69.7 \n|Sep high F = 63.2\n|Oct high F = 52.1\n|Nov high F = 38.2\n|Dec high F = 34.0\n|Jan low F = 19.0\n|Feb low F = 18.5 \n|Mar low F = 19.8\n|Apr low F = 23.0\n|May low F = 28.3\n|Jun low F = 33.3\n|Jul low F = 40.5\n|Aug low F = 40.6 \n|Sep low F = 36.2\n|Oct low F = 30.1\n|Nov low F = 22.6\n|Dec low F = 18.8\n|Jan precipitation inch = 9.32\n|Feb precipitation inch = 7.75\n|Mar precipitation inch = 7.48\n|Apr precipitation inch = 5.37\n|May precipitation inch = 3.55\n|Jun precipitation inch = 2.22 \n|Jul precipitation inch = 1.02 \n|Aug precipitation inch = 1.00\n|Sep precipitation inch = 1.85\n|Oct precipitation inch = 4.44\n|Nov precipitation inch = 10.29\n|Dec precipitation inch = 11.41\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan snow inch = 85.5\n|Feb snow inch = 73.8\n|Mar snow inch = 73.4\n|Apr snow inch = 48.8\n|May snow inch = 17.4\n|Jun snow inch = 4.1\n|Jul snow inch = 0.2\n|Aug snow inch = 0\n|Sep snow inch = 3.1\n|Oct snow inch = 17.3\n|Nov snow inch = 71.1\n|Dec snow inch = 92.7\n|unit precipitation days = 0.01 in\n|unit snow days = 0.1 in\n|Jan precipitation days = 17.9\n|Feb precipitation days = 15.9\n|Mar precipitation days = 18.1\n|Apr precipitation days = 15.5\n|May precipitation days = 11.2\n|Jun precipitation days = 8.1\n|Jul precipitation days = 3.9\n|Aug precipitation days = 4.0\n|Sep precipitation days = 5.8\n|Oct precipitation days = 9.8\n|Nov precipitation days = 17.5\n|Dec precipitation days = 18.0\n|Jan snow days = 15.9\n|Feb snow days = 14.3\n|Mar snow days = 16.1\n|Apr snow days = 12.6\n|May snow days = 6.0\n|Jun snow days = 2.0  \n|Jul snow days = 0.2\n|Aug snow days = 0.1\n|Sep snow days = 1.0\n|Oct snow days = 4.7\n|Nov snow days = 13.2\n|Dec snow days = 16.4\n|source 1 = NOAA <ref name = NOAA >\n{{cite web\n  |url = http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=mfr\n  |title = NowData&nbsp;\u2013 NOAA Online Weather Data\n  |publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n  |accessdate = 2012-05-26}}</ref>\n|date=March 2012\n}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Fauna==\nMammals that are residents of this national park are [[Canada lynx|Canadian lynxes]], [[bobcat]]s, [[North American beaver|beavers]], [[chipmunk]]s, [[pronghorn]]s, [[fox]]es, [[squirrel]]s, [[North American porcupine|porcupines]], [[American black bear|black bears]], [[coyote]]s, [[American pika|pika]], [[American badger|badger]]s, [[deer]], [[Rocky Mountain elk|elk]], [[muskrat]]s, and [[American marten|martens]].

Even after thousands of years, this area is largely devoid of plants due to excessive porosity (meaning water drains through quickly) and poor soil composed primarily of [[regolith]].\n* The Pinnacles: When the very hot ash and pumice came to rest near the volcano, it formed {{convert|200|to|300|ft|-1|adj=mid|-thick}} gas-charged deposits. For perhaps years afterward, hot gas moved to the surface and slowly cemented ash and pumice together in channels and escaped through [[fumarole]]s. [[Erosion]] later removed most of the surrounding loose ash and pumice, leaving tall pinnacles and spires.\n\n;Other park features:\n* [[Mount Scott (Klamath County, Oregon)|Mount Scott]] is a steep [[andesite|andesitic]] cone whose [[lava]] came from [[magma]] from Mazama's [[magma chamber]]; geologists call such volcano a [[parasitic cone|parasitic]] or satellite cone. Volcanic eruptions apparently ceased on Scott sometime before the end of the [[Pleistocene]]; one remaining large [[cirque (landform)|cirque]] on Scott's northwest side was left unmodified by post-[[ice age|ice-age]] volcanism.\n* In the southwest corner of the park stands [[Union Peak]], an extinct volcano whose primary remains consist of a large volcanic plug, which is lava that solidified in the volcano's neck.\n* Crater Peak is a [[shield volcano]] primarily made of andesite and [[basalt]] lava flows topped by andesitic and [[dacite]] tephra.\n* Timber Crater is a shield volcano located in the northeast corner of the park.

The legend tells of two Chiefs, [[Llao]] of the Below World and [[Skell]] of the Above World, pitted in a battle which ended up in the destruction of Llao's home, Mt. Mazama.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/crla/New%20Folder/crlacr.htm | title = Park History | publisher = National Park Service | accessdate={{date|2010-10-18|mdy}}}}</ref> The battle was witnessed in the eruption of Mt. Mazama and the creation of Crater Lake.\n\nA trio of [[gold]] prospectors: [[John Wesley Hillman]], Henry Klippel, and Isaac Skeeters were the first white people to visit the lake. On June 12, 1853, they stumbled upon the long, sloping mountain while hunting for provisions. Stunned by vibrant blue color of the lake, they named the [[indigo]] body of water \"Deep Blue Lake\" and the place on the southwest side of the rim where he first saw the lake later became known as Discovery Point.<ref name=\"nps\"/>  But gold was more on the minds of settlers at the time and the discovery was soon forgotten. The suggested name later fell out of favor by locals, who preferred the name ''Crater Lake''.\n\n[[William Gladstone Steel]] devoted his life and fortune to the establishment and management of a national park at Crater Lake. His preoccupation with the lake began in 1870. In his efforts to bring recognition to the park, he participated in lake surveys that provided scientific support. He named many of the lake's landmarks, including [[Wizard Island]], Llao Rock, and Skell Head.\n\nWith the help of geologist Clarence Dutton, Steel organized a USGS expedition to study the lake in 1886. The party carried the ''Cleetwood'', a half-ton survey boat, up the steep slopes of the mountain then lowered it to the lake. From the stern of the ''Cleetwood'', a piece of pipe on the end of a spool of [[piano wire]] sounded the depth of the lake at 168 different points.  Their deepest sounding, {{convert|1996|ft}}, was very close to the modern official depth of {{convert|1949|ft}} made in 2000 by [[sonar]].<ref name=\"deepest\"/>  At the same time, a [[topography|topographer]] surveyed the area and created the first professional [[map]] of the Crater Lake area.\n[[File:Crater Lake Lodge Rim Village Historic District.jpg|thumb|[[Crater Lake Lodge]]]]\nPartly based on data from the expedition and lobbying from Steel and others, Crater Lake National Park was established May 22, 1902 by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. And because of Steel's involvement, [[Crater Lake Lodge]] was opened in 1915 and the Rim Drive was completed in 1918.<ref name=\"nps\" />\n\n[[Highway]]s were later built to the park to help facilitate tourism. The 1929 edition of ''[[O Ranger!]]'' described access and facilities available by then:\n<blockquote>Crater Lake National Park is reached by train on the Southern Pacific Railroad lines into Medford and Klamath Falls, at which stops motor stages make the short trip to the park. A hotel on the rim of the lake offers accommodations. For the motorist, the visit to the park is a short side trip from the [[Pacific Highway (United States)|Pacific]] and [[The Dalles-California Highway|Dalles-California]] highways. He will find, in addition to the hotel, campsites, stores, filling stations. The park is open to travel from late June or July 1 for as long as snow does not block the roads, generally until October.<ref>{{cite book | first1 = Horace M. | last1 = Albright | first2 = Frank J. | last2 = Taylor | title = Oh, Ranger! | others = illustrated by Ruth Taylor White | publisher = The Chatham Press, Inc. | location = Riverside, Connecticut | edition = Centennial | url = http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/albright3/ | chapterurl = http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/albright3/chap13a.htm | accessdate = {{date|2006-08-18|mdy}} | date = {{date|2004-09-06|mdy}} | chapter = Glimpses of the National Parks and Monuments | origyear = 1928 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe lake is described in the poetry of [[Joaquin Miller]].<ref name=ea>{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Crater Lake National Park}}</ref>\n\n==Activities==\n[[Image:Daily trips CLNP.jpg|thumb|upright|Daily Trips (1931)]]\nThere are many [[hiking]] trails and several campgrounds inside the park.

The group consists of founder [[Billy Gibbons]] (guitar, lead vocals), [[Dusty Hill]] (bass, vocals) and [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] (drums, percussion). Initially rooted in [[blues]], ZZ Top's style has evolved throughout their career, with a signature sound based on Gibbons' blues guitar style and Hill and Beard's rhythm section. Their lyrics, often embellished with [[sexual innuendo]], focus on their Texas roots and humor. Popular for their live performances, the group has staged several elaborate tours.\n \nZZ Top formed after the demise of Gibbons' previous band, [[Moving Sidewalks]]. Within a year, they signed with [[London Records]] and released ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971). Subsequent releases, such as their first top-ten album ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' (1973) and the singles \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" and \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\", gained extensive radio airplay. By the mid-1970s, they had become renowned in North America for their live act, highlighted by their performances during the [[Worldwide Texas Tour]] from 1976 to 1977, which made them national stars and was a critical and commercial success.\n \nFollowing a two-year break after facing creative stagnation and exhaustion, ZZ Top reinvented themselves in the late 1970s with a new musical direction and public image. Beginning with their albums [[Deg\u00fcello]] (1979) and [[El Loco]] (1981), they experimented with instruments including [[clavinet]]s, [[saxophone]]s, and [[synthesizer]]s, while Gibbons and Hill grew long beards as part of their image. ZZ Top gained international favor with the records ''[[Eliminator (album)|Eliminator]]'' (1983) and ''[[Afterburner (ZZ Top album)|Afterburner]]'' (1985), which integrated influences from [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Punk rock|punk]], and [[dance-rock]], and established a more mainstream sound. The popularity of their [[Music video|music videos]], including those for \"[[Gimme All Your Lovin']]\", \"[[Sharp Dressed Man]]\", and \"[[Legs (song)|Legs]]\", helped propel them onto the television channel [[MTV]] and made them one of the more prominent artists in [[1980s#Popular_culture|1980s pop culture]]. Their [[Afterburner Tour]] set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour of 1986. After additional acclaim with the release of their tenth album ''[[Recycler (album)|Recycler]]'' (1990) and the [[Recycler Tour]], their experimentation continued with the albums ''[[Antenna (ZZ Top album)|Antenna]]'' (1994), ''[[Rhythmeen]]'' (1996), ''[[XXX (ZZ Top album)|XXX]]'' (1999), and ''[[Mescalero (album)|Mescalero]]'' (2003), with mixed successes. The group most recently released ''[[La Futura]]'' (2012) and ''Goin\u2032 50'' (2019), the latter of which is a compilation album commemorating the band's 50th anniversary.\n\nZZ Top has released 15 studio albums and sold an estimated 50 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|first= Gabriel |last= Falcon |title= ZZ Top: After 50 years they've still got legs |publisher= [[CBS News]] |date= July 21, 2019 |accessdate= March 4, 2020 |url= https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zz-top-goin-50-dusty-hill-frank-beard-billy-gibbons/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Peter |last= Blackstock |title= ZZ Top at 50: Billy Gibbons takes us back to the beginning |newspaper= [[Austin American-Statesman]] |date= May 15, 2019 |accessdate= May 15, 2019 |url= https://www.austin360.com/entertainmentlife/20190515/zz-top-at-50-billy-gibbons-takes-us-back-to-beginning}}</ref> They have won three [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and in 2004, they were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

The band had a little apartment covered with concert posters and he noticed that many performers' names used initials. Gibbons particularly noticed [[B.B. King]] and [[Z. Z. Hill|Z.Z. Hill]] and thought of combining the two into \"ZZ King\", but considered it too similar to the original name. He then figured that \"king is going at the top\" which brought him to \"ZZ Top.\"<ref>{{cite web|title= Uncle Joe Benson \u2013 The Story: ZZ Top 9-11-15 The Stor |publisher= [[SoundCloud]] |url= https://soundcloud.com/uncle-joe-benson/the-story-zz-top-9-11-15 |accessdate= September 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nZZ Top was managed by [[Bill Ham]], a [[Waxahachie, Texas]], native who had befriended Gibbons a year earlier. They released their first single, \"Salt Lick,\"  in 1969, and the B-side contained the song \"Miller's Farm.\" Both songs credited Gibbons as the composer. Immediately after the recording of \"Salt Lick,\" Greig was replaced by bassist Billy Ethridge, a bandmate of [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and Mitchell was replaced by [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] of [[American Blues]]. Due to lack of interest from the major American record companies, ZZ Top accepted a record deal from [[London Records]], the American affiliate of the British [[Decca Records]] label. Unwilling to sign a recording contract, Ethridge quit the band and [[Dusty Hill]], Frank Beard's American Blues bandmate, became his replacement. After Hill moved from Dallas to Houston, ZZ Top signed with London in 1970. They performed their first concert together at the Knights of Columbus Hall in [[Beaumont, Texas]], on February 10, 1970.\n\nIn addition to assuming the role as the band's leader, Gibbons became the main lyricist and musical arranger. With the assistance of Ham and engineer Robin Hood Brians, ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971) was released and exhibited the band's humor, with \"barrelhouse\" rhythms, distorted guitars, double entendres, and innuendo. The music and songs reflected ZZ Top's blues influences. Following their debut album, the band released ''[[Rio Grande Mud]]'' (1972), which produced their first charting single, \"[[Francine (song)|Francine]]\".<ref>{{cite web|first= Matthew |last= Wilkening |title= Revisiting ZZ Top's Second Album, 'Rio Grande Mud' |website= [[Ultimate Classic Rock]] |date= April 4, 2015 |accessdate= June 5, 2019 |url= https://ultimateclassicrock.com/zz-top-rio-grande-mud-turns-40/}}</ref>\n\n===First decade and signature sound (1973\u20131982)===\n[[File:ZZ Top (1976).png|230px|thumb|right|ZZ Top performing live in 1976]]\nZZ Top released ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' in 1973. The album's sound was the result of the propulsive support provided by Hill and Beard, and Gibbons' \"growling\" guitar tone. Dan Erlewine wrote that the album \"brought ZZ Top their first Top Ten record, making them stars in the process.\" The album included the boogie-driven \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" (written about the [[Chicken Ranch (Texas)|Chicken Ranch]], a notorious brothel in [[La Grange, Texas]], that also inspired the musical ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]''). On the subsequent tour, the band performed sold-out concerts in the US. ZZ Top recorded the live tracks for their 1975 album, ''[[Fandango!]]'', during this tour. ''Fandango!'', a mixture of live recordings and new studio songs, was a top-ten album; its single \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\" peaked at number 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. ''[[Tejas (album)|Tejas]]'', released in 1976, would be the band's final album under their contract with London Records.

The group consists of founder [[Billy Gibbons]] (guitar, lead vocals), [[Dusty Hill]] (bass, vocals) and [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] (drums, percussion). Initially rooted in [[blues]], ZZ Top's style has evolved throughout their career, with a signature sound based on Gibbons' blues guitar style and Hill and Beard's rhythm section. Their lyrics, often embellished with [[sexual innuendo]], focus on their Texas roots and humor. Popular for their live performances, the group has staged several elaborate tours.\n \nZZ Top formed after the demise of Gibbons' previous band, [[Moving Sidewalks]]. Within a year, they signed with [[London Records]] and released ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971). Subsequent releases, such as their first top-ten album ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' (1973) and the singles \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" and \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\", gained extensive radio airplay. By the mid-1970s, they had become renowned in North America for their live act, highlighted by their performances during the [[Worldwide Texas Tour]] from 1976 to 1977, which made them national stars and was a critical and commercial success.\n \nFollowing a two-year break after facing creative stagnation and exhaustion, ZZ Top reinvented themselves in the late 1970s with a new musical direction and public image. Beginning with their albums [[Deg\u00fcello]] (1979) and [[El Loco]] (1981), they experimented with instruments including [[clavinet]]s, [[saxophone]]s, and [[synthesizer]]s, while Gibbons and Hill grew long beards as part of their image. ZZ Top gained international favor with the records ''[[Eliminator (album)|Eliminator]]'' (1983) and ''[[Afterburner (ZZ Top album)|Afterburner]]'' (1985), which integrated influences from [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Punk rock|punk]], and [[dance-rock]], and established a more mainstream sound. The popularity of their [[Music video|music videos]], including those for \"[[Gimme All Your Lovin']]\", \"[[Sharp Dressed Man]]\", and \"[[Legs (song)|Legs]]\", helped propel them onto the television channel [[MTV]] and made them one of the more prominent artists in [[1980s#Popular_culture|1980s pop culture]]. Their [[Afterburner Tour]] set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour of 1986. After additional acclaim with the release of their tenth album ''[[Recycler (album)|Recycler]]'' (1990) and the [[Recycler Tour]], their experimentation continued with the albums ''[[Antenna (ZZ Top album)|Antenna]]'' (1994), ''[[Rhythmeen]]'' (1996), ''[[XXX (ZZ Top album)|XXX]]'' (1999), and ''[[Mescalero (album)|Mescalero]]'' (2003), with mixed successes. The group most recently released ''[[La Futura]]'' (2012) and ''Goin\u2032 50'' (2019), the latter of which is a compilation album commemorating the band's 50th anniversary.\n\nZZ Top has released 15 studio albums and sold an estimated 50 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|first= Gabriel |last= Falcon |title= ZZ Top: After 50 years they've still got legs |publisher= [[CBS News]] |date= July 21, 2019 |accessdate= March 4, 2020 |url= https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zz-top-goin-50-dusty-hill-frank-beard-billy-gibbons/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Peter |last= Blackstock |title= ZZ Top at 50: Billy Gibbons takes us back to the beginning |newspaper= [[Austin American-Statesman]] |date= May 15, 2019 |accessdate= May 15, 2019 |url= https://www.austin360.com/entertainmentlife/20190515/zz-top-at-50-billy-gibbons-takes-us-back-to-beginning}}</ref> They have won three [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and in 2004, they were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

The band had a little apartment covered with concert posters and he noticed that many performers' names used initials. Gibbons particularly noticed [[B.B. King]] and [[Z. Z. Hill|Z.Z. Hill]] and thought of combining the two into \"ZZ King\", but considered it too similar to the original name. He then figured that \"king is going at the top\" which brought him to \"ZZ Top.\"<ref>{{cite web|title= Uncle Joe Benson \u2013 The Story: ZZ Top 9-11-15 The Stor |publisher= [[SoundCloud]] |url= https://soundcloud.com/uncle-joe-benson/the-story-zz-top-9-11-15 |accessdate= September 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nZZ Top was managed by [[Bill Ham]], a [[Waxahachie, Texas]], native who had befriended Gibbons a year earlier. They released their first single, \"Salt Lick,\"  in 1969, and the B-side contained the song \"Miller's Farm.\" Both songs credited Gibbons as the composer. Immediately after the recording of \"Salt Lick,\" Greig was replaced by bassist Billy Ethridge, a bandmate of [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and Mitchell was replaced by [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] of [[American Blues]]. Due to lack of interest from the major American record companies, ZZ Top accepted a record deal from [[London Records]], the American affiliate of the British [[Decca Records]] label. Unwilling to sign a recording contract, Ethridge quit the band and [[Dusty Hill]], Frank Beard's American Blues bandmate, became his replacement. After Hill moved from Dallas to Houston, ZZ Top signed with London in 1970. They performed their first concert together at the Knights of Columbus Hall in [[Beaumont, Texas]], on February 10, 1970.\n\nIn addition to assuming the role as the band's leader, Gibbons became the main lyricist and musical arranger. With the assistance of Ham and engineer Robin Hood Brians, ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971) was released and exhibited the band's humor, with \"barrelhouse\" rhythms, distorted guitars, double entendres, and innuendo. The music and songs reflected ZZ Top's blues influences. Following their debut album, the band released ''[[Rio Grande Mud]]'' (1972), which produced their first charting single, \"[[Francine (song)|Francine]]\".<ref>{{cite web|first= Matthew |last= Wilkening |title= Revisiting ZZ Top's Second Album, 'Rio Grande Mud' |website= [[Ultimate Classic Rock]] |date= April 4, 2015 |accessdate= June 5, 2019 |url= https://ultimateclassicrock.com/zz-top-rio-grande-mud-turns-40/}}</ref>\n\n===First decade and signature sound (1973\u20131982)===\n[[File:ZZ Top (1976).png|230px|thumb|right|ZZ Top performing live in 1976]]\nZZ Top released ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' in 1973. The album's sound was the result of the propulsive support provided by Hill and Beard, and Gibbons' \"growling\" guitar tone. Dan Erlewine wrote that the album \"brought ZZ Top their first Top Ten record, making them stars in the process.\" The album included the boogie-driven \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" (written about the [[Chicken Ranch (Texas)|Chicken Ranch]], a notorious brothel in [[La Grange, Texas]], that also inspired the musical ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]''). On the subsequent tour, the band performed sold-out concerts in the US. ZZ Top recorded the live tracks for their 1975 album, ''[[Fandango!]]'', during this tour. ''Fandango!'' was a top-ten album; its single \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\" peaked at number 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. ''[[Tejas (album)|Tejas]]'', released in 1976, would be the band's final album under their contract with London Records.
