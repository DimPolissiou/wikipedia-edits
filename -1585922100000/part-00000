Of these, 34% (541,711) are registered Republicans, and 33.3% (529,651) are registered Democrats. An additional 28.5% (453,343) declined to state a political party.<ref name=\"voterstats\">{{cite web|url=https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ror/ror-odd-year-2019/politicalsub.pdf|title=Report of Registration Odd-Number Year Report by political subdivision|date=February 10, 2019|publisher=California Secretary of State|accessdate=June 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOrange County has produced such notable Republicans as President [[Richard Nixon]] (born in [[Yorba Linda, California|Yorba Linda]] and lived in [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]] and [[San Clemente, California|San Clemente]]), U.S. Senator [[John F. Seymour]] (previously [[mayor of Anaheim, California|mayor of Anaheim]]), and U.S. Senator [[Thomas Kuchel]] (of Anaheim). Former Congressman [[Christopher Cox]] (of Newport Beach), a White House counsel for President Reagan, is also a former chairman of the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]. Orange County was also home to former Republican Congressman [[John G. Schmitz]], a presidential candidate in 1972 from the ultra-conservative [[American Independent Party]] and the father of [[Mary Kay Letourneau]]. In 1996, [[Curt Pringle]] (later mayor of Anaheim) became the first Republican Speaker of the [[California State Assembly]] in decades.\n\nWhile the growth of the county's [[Hispanic]] and [[Asian people|Asian]] populations in recent decades has significantly influenced Orange County's culture, its conservative reputation has remained largely intact. Partisan voter registration patterns of Hispanics, Asians and other ethnic minorities in the county have tended to reflect the surrounding demographics, with resultant Republican majorities in all but the central portion of the county. When [[Loretta Sanchez]], a [[Blue Dog Coalition|Blue Dog Democrat]], defeated veteran Republican [[Bob Dornan]] in 1996, she was continuing a trend of Democratic representation of that district that had been interrupted by Dornan's 1984 upset of former Congressman [[Jerry M. Patterson|Jerry Patterson]]. Until 1992, Sanchez herself was a moderate Republican, and she is viewed as somewhat more moderate than other Democrats from Southern California.\n\nIn 2004, [[George W. Bush]] captured 60% of the county's vote, up from 56% in 2000 despite a higher Democratic popular vote statewide. Although [[Barbara Boxer]] won statewide, and fared better in Orange County than she did in 1998, Republican [[Bill Jones (California politician)|Bill Jones]] defeated her in the county, 51% to 43%. While the 39% that [[John Kerry]] received is higher than the percentage [[Bill Clinton]] won in 1992 or 1996, the percentage of the vote George W. Bush received in 2004 (60%) is the highest any presidential candidate has received since 1988, showing a still-dominant GOP presence in the county. In 2006, Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] won 45% of the vote in the county, the best showing of a Democrat in a Senate race in over four decades, but Orange was nevertheless the only [[Coastal California]] county to vote for her Republican opponent, [[Dick Mountjoy]].\n\nThe county is featured prominently in Lisa McGirr's book ''Suburban Warriors: The Origins of the New American Right''. She argues that its conservative political orientation in the 20th century owed much to its settlement by farmers from the [[Great Plains]], who reacted strongly to communist sympathies, the [[civil rights movement]], and the turmoil of the 1960s in nearby Los Angeles \u2014 across the \"[[Orange Curtain]]\".\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Orange County was one of California's leading Republican voting blocs and a subculture of residents with \"Middle American\" values that emphasized capitalist religious morality{{clarify|date=November 2012}} in contrast to [[San Francisco values|West coast liberalism]].\n\nOrange County has many Republican voters from culturally conservative [[Asian Americans|Asian-American]], [[Middle Eastern Americans|Middle Eastern]] and Latino immigrant groups. The large [[Vietnamese Americans|Vietnamese-American]] communities in [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]] and [[Westminster, California|Westminster]] are predominantly Republican; Vietnamese Americans registered Republicans outnumber those registered as Democrats, 55% to 22% as of 2007, while as of 2017 that figure is 42% to 36%. Republican Assemblyman [[Van Tran]] was the first Vietnamese-American elected to a state legislature and joined with Texan [[Hubert Vo]] as the highest-ranking elected Vietnamese-American in the United States until the 2008 election of [[Joseph Cao]] in [[Louisiana's 2nd congressional district]]. In the 2007 special election for the vacant county supervisor seat following Democrat [[Lou Correa]]'s election to the state senate, two Vietnamese-American Republican candidates topped the list of 10 candidates, separated from each other by only seven votes, making the [[Orange County Board of Supervisors]] entirely Republican; Correa is first of only two Democrats to have served on the Board since 1987 and only the fifth since 1963.\n\nEven with the Democratic sweep of Orange County's congressional seats in 2018, as well as a steady trend of Democratic gains in voter registration, the county remains very Republican downballot. In much of the county, the district's congressperson is the only elected Democrat above the county level, and in some cases the only elected Democrat above the municipal level. Generally, larger cities\u2013those with a population over 100,000, such as Anaheim, Santa Ana, and Irvine - feature a registration advantage for Democrats, while the other municipalities still have a Republican voter registration advantage. This is especially true in Newport Beach, Yorba Linda, and Villa Park, the three cities where the Republican advantage is largest. As of February 10, 2019, the only exceptions to the former are Huntington Beach and Orange, while exceptions to the latter include Buena Park, Laguna Beach and Stanton.<ref name=\"voterstats\" />\n\n===Voter registration===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | Population and registered voters\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Total population<ref name=\"US-CB-B02001\" />\n| colspan=\"2\" | 3,172,532\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | &nbsp;&nbsp;Registered voters<ref name=\"CA-SS\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ror/ror-pages/ror-odd-year-2013/political-sub.pdf |title=February 10, 2013 - Report of Registration |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=California Secretary of State |access-date=October 31, 2013 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103114419/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ror/ror-pages/ror-odd-year-2013/political-sub.pdf |archive-date=November 3, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"PCT-RV\" group=note>Percentage of registered voters with respect to total population.

Of these, 34% (541,711) are registered Republicans, and 33.3% (529,651) are registered Democrats. An additional 28.5% (453,343) declined to state a political party.<ref name=\"voterstats\">{{cite web|url=https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ror/ror-odd-year-2019/politicalsub.pdf|title=Report of Registration Odd-Number Year Report by political subdivision|date=2019-02-10|publisher=California Secretary of State|accessdate=2019-06-10}}</ref>\n\nOrange County has produced such notable Republicans as President [[Richard Nixon]] (born in [[Yorba Linda, California|Yorba Linda]] and lived in [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]] and [[San Clemente, California|San Clemente]]), U.S. Senator [[John F. Seymour]] (previously [[mayor of Anaheim, California|mayor of Anaheim]]), and U.S. Senator [[Thomas Kuchel]] (of Anaheim). Former Congressman [[Christopher Cox]] (of Newport Beach), a White House counsel for President Reagan, is also a former chairman of the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]. Orange County was also home to former Republican Congressman [[John G. Schmitz]], a presidential candidate in 1972 from the ultra-conservative [[American Independent Party]] and the father of [[Mary Kay Letourneau]]. In 1996, [[Curt Pringle]] (later mayor of Anaheim) became the first Republican Speaker of the [[California State Assembly]] in decades.\n\nWhile the growth of the county's [[Hispanic]] and [[Asian people|Asian]] populations in recent decades has significantly influenced Orange County's culture, its conservative reputation has remained largely intact. Partisan voter registration patterns of Hispanics, Asians and other ethnic minorities in the county have tended to reflect the surrounding demographics, with resultant Republican majorities in all but the central portion of the county. When [[Loretta Sanchez]], a [[Blue Dog Coalition|Blue Dog Democrat]], defeated veteran Republican [[Bob Dornan]] in 1996, she was continuing a trend of Democratic representation of that district that had been interrupted by Dornan's 1984 upset of former Congressman [[Jerry M. Patterson|Jerry Patterson]]. Until 1992, Sanchez herself was a moderate Republican, and she is viewed as somewhat more moderate than other Democrats from Southern California.\n\nIn 2004, [[George W. Bush]] captured 60% of the county's vote, up from 56% in 2000 despite a higher Democratic popular vote statewide. Although [[Barbara Boxer]] won statewide, and fared better in Orange County than she did in 1998, Republican [[Bill Jones (California politician)|Bill Jones]] defeated her in the county, 51% to 43%. While the 39% that [[John Kerry]] received is higher than the percentage [[Bill Clinton]] won in 1992 or 1996, the percentage of the vote George W. Bush received in 2004 (60%) is the highest any presidential candidate has received since 1988, showing a still-dominant GOP presence in the county. In 2006, Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] won 45% of the vote in the county, the best showing of a Democrat in a Senate race in over four decades, but Orange was nevertheless the only [[Coastal California]] county to vote for her Republican opponent, [[Dick Mountjoy]].\n\nThe county is featured prominently in Lisa McGirr's book ''Suburban Warriors: The Origins of the New American Right''. She argues that its conservative political orientation in the 20th century owed much to its settlement by farmers from the [[Great Plains]], who reacted strongly to communist sympathies, the [[civil rights movement]], and the turmoil of the 1960s in nearby Los Angeles \u2014 across the \"[[Orange Curtain]]\".\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Orange County was one of California's leading Republican voting blocs and a subculture of residents with \"Middle American\" values that emphasized capitalist religious morality{{clarify|date=November 2012}} in contrast to [[San Francisco values|West coast liberalism]].\n\nOrange County has many Republican voters from culturally conservative [[Asian Americans|Asian-American]], [[Middle Eastern Americans|Middle Eastern]] and Latino immigrant groups. The large [[Vietnamese Americans|Vietnamese-American]] communities in [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]] and [[Westminster, California|Westminster]] are predominantly Republican; Vietnamese Americans registered Republicans outnumber those registered as Democrats, 55% to 22% as of 2007, while as of 2017 that figure is 42% to 36%. Republican Assemblyman [[Van Tran]] was the first Vietnamese-American elected to a state legislature and joined with Texan [[Hubert Vo]] as the highest-ranking elected Vietnamese-American in the United States until the 2008 election of [[Joseph Cao]] in [[Louisiana's 2nd congressional district]]. In the 2007 special election for the vacant county supervisor seat following Democrat [[Lou Correa]]'s election to the state senate, two Vietnamese-American Republican candidates topped the list of 10 candidates, separated from each other by only seven votes, making the [[Orange County Board of Supervisors]] entirely Republican; Correa is first of only two Democrats to have served on the Board since 1987 and only the fifth since 1963.\n\nEven with the Democratic sweep of Orange County's congressional seats in 2018, as well as a steady trend of Democratic gains in voter registration, the county remains very Republican downballot. In much of the county, the district's congressperson is the only elected Democrat above the county level, and in some cases the only elected Democrat above the municipal level. Generally, larger cities\u2013those with a population over 100,000, such as Anaheim, Santa Ana, and Irvine - feature a registration advantage for Democrats, while the other municipalities still have a Republican voter registration advantage. This is especially true in Newport Beach, Yorba Linda, and Villa Park, the three cities where the Republican advantage is largest. As of February 10, 2019, the only exceptions to the former are Huntington Beach and Orange, while exceptions to the latter include Buena Park, Laguna Beach and Stanton.<ref name=\"voterstats\" />\n\n===Voter registration===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | Population and registered voters\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Total population<ref name=\"US-CB-B02001\" />\n| colspan=\"2\" | 3,172,532\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | &nbsp;&nbsp;Registered voters<ref name=\"CA-SS\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ror/ror-pages/ror-odd-year-2013/political-sub.pdf |title=February 10, 2013 - Report of Registration |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=California Secretary of State |access-date=October 31, 2013 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103114419/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ror/ror-pages/ror-odd-year-2013/political-sub.pdf |archive-date=November 3, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"PCT-RV\" group=note>Percentage of registered voters with respect to total population.

Chuvalo became Canadian amateur heavyweight champion in May 1955, defeating [[Winnipeg]]'s Peter Piper with a first-round KO in a tournament final in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]]. Chuvalo finished his amateur career with a 16\u20130\u20130 record, all by KO within four rounds.  Nicknamed \"Boom Boom\", Chuvalo turned professional in 1956, knocking out four opponents in one night to win a heavyweight tournament held by former world's champion [[Jack Dempsey]] at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in Toronto on April 26, 1956.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zawadzki|first=Edward|title=The Ultimate Canadian Sports Trivia Book, Volume 1|year=2001|publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd|location=Canada|isbn=9780888822376|page=216}}</ref>\n\n==Against Ali==\n\nChuvalo is best known for his two fights against [[Muhammad Ali]].

{"title_page": "Pediatric Leadership Alliance", "text_new": "The '''Pediatric Leadership Alliance''' ('''PLA''') is a proprietary physician leadership program of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]]  (AAP). The program is highly interactive and incorporates case studies, team-based exercises and tools to help participants in their leadership journey, and uses evidence-based leadership principles as its core curriculum. The PLA is built upon Kouse\u2019s and Posner\u2019s [[The_Leadership_Challenge#.22The_Five_Practices_of_Exemplary_Leadership.22|five practices of exemplary leadership]],<ref>[http://www.leadershipchallenge.com Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership]</ref> and includes an individual leadership assessment and a learning agreement to participants to measure their development. It is offered in the format of a series of didactic lectures followed by other modalities shown to enhance participant interactions.<ref>D Davis, [http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=389532 \"A Systematic Review of the Effect of Continuing Medical Education Strategies\"], ''The Journal of the American Medical Association'', 1995</ref> The PLA focuses on developing the core competencies for public health leadership as identified by the U.S National Public Health Leadership Network. These competencies include visionary leadership, sense of mission, effective change, political processes, negotiation, ethics and power, marketing and education, understanding of organizational dynamics, inter-organizational collaborating mechanisms, social forecasting, developing team-oriented systems, facilitation and mediation and serving as an effective team member.<ref>K Wright, [http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.90.8.1202 \"Competency Development in Public Health Leadership\"], ''American Journal of Public Health'', 2000</ref>\n\n==Target==\nUnlike the majority of leadership training programs, the PLA is tailored for young physicians at the beginning of their professional careers. By instilling the principles of leadership in this generation, they ensuring a sound foundation for their career development and are also giving these skills to the ones who are the most likely to make significant change in their communities and institutions.\n\n==Objectives==\n*\tBe inspired to work with, and advance treatment for, children with ADHD and their families\n*\tBe inspired to believe they can make a difference\n*\tUnderstand the dynamics and process of making large-scale health care system change and the incremental steps to doing so\n*\tUnderstand the functional, day-to-day behaviors of leadership\n*\tDevelop strategies for managing and resolving conflict\n*\tUnderstand the dynamics and importance of effective teams\n\n==Rationale==\nMost physicians are in positions of potential leadership. Reinertsen, in his article Physicians as Leaders in the Improvement of Health Care Systems,<ref>JL Reinertsen, [http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=711416 \"Physicians as Leaders in the Improvement of Health Care Systems\"], ''Annals of Internal Medicine'', 1998</ref> used a business-based definition of leadership, describing it as the ability to coordinate processes that begin an organization or facilitate an organization\u2019s adaptation to changing circumstances. Whether serving in an academic medical center, working as a physician executive in a health plan or public health program, functioning as a partner in a group practice, collaborating on a community project, or advocating for effective health legislation, physicians have multiple opportunities to function as leaders in changing health care in the 21st century.\n\nDespite these prospects, many physicians either have not taken on leadership roles or function ineffectively in those roles. Some have argued that the majority of administrative, organizational, team- building, and self-assessment skills of quality leaders are not taught in medical training programs. In fact, much of traditional medical curricula have emphasized autonomy in decision making, the individual physician-patient relationship, and hierarchical cultural processes that are counterproductive to effective leadership.<ref>R Schwartz, [http://academy.clevelandclinic.org/Portals/40/Physician%20leadership_Essential%20skills.pdf \"Physician Leadership: Essential Skills in a Changing Environment\"], ''The American Journal of Surgery'', 2000</ref> In addition, although leadership development programs have been implemented in many sectors of the economy and have been accompanied by a rapid proliferation of both a scholarly evaluation and the popular inspirational literature, medicine has tended to act as though leadership were an innate characteristic and not a skill to be learned. Until recently, physicians who were interested in acquiring leadership skills training have had to search for programs in industries outside medicine.\n\n==Principles==\nKouze's and Posner's Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership<ref>[http://www.leadershipchallenge.com Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership]</ref> model proves its effectiveness as a clear, evidence-based path to achieving the extraordinary\u2014for individuals, teams, organizations, and communities. It turns the abstract concept of leadership into easy-to-grasp practices and behaviors that can be taught and learned by anyone willing to step up and accept the challenge to lead.\n\n===Model the Way===\nLeaders establish principles concerning the way people (constituents, peers, colleagues, and customers alike) should be treated and the way goals should be pursued. They create standards of excellence and then set an example for others to follow. Because the prospect of complex change can overwhelm people and stifle action, they set interim goals so that people can achieve small wins as they work toward larger objectives. They unravel bureaucracy when it impedes action; they put up signposts when people are unsure of where to go or how to get there; and they create opportunities for victory.\n\n===Inspire a Shared Vision===\nLeaders passionately believe that they can make a difference. They envision the future, creating an ideal and unique image of what the organization can become. Through their magnetism and quiet persuasion, leaders enlist others in their dreams. They breathe life into their visions and get people to see exciting possibilities for the future.\n\n===Challenge the Process===\nLeaders search for opportunities to change the status quo. They look for innovative ways to improve the organization. In doing so, they experiment and take risks. And because leaders know that risk taking involves mistakes and failures, they accept the inevitable disappointments as learning opportunities.\n\n===Enable Others to Act===\nLeaders foster collaboration and build spirited teams. They actively involve others. Leaders understand that mutual respect is what sustains extraordinary efforts; they strive to create an atmosphere of trust and human dignity. They strengthen others, making each person feel capable and powerful.\n\n===Encourage the Heart===\nAccomplishing extraordinary things in organizations is hard work.

The PLA is built upon Kouse\u2019s and Posner\u2019s [[The_Leadership_Challenge#.22The_Five_Practices_of_Exemplary_Leadership.22|five practices of exemplary leadership]],<ref>[http://www.leadershipchallenge.com Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership]</ref> and includes an individual leadership assessment and a learning agreement to participants to measure their development.

These competencies include visionary leadership, sense of mission, effective change, political processes, negotiation, ethics and power, marketing and education, understanding of organizational dynamics, inter-organizational collaborating mechanisms, social forecasting, developing team-oriented systems, facilitation and mediation and serving as an effective team member.<ref>K Wright, [http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.90.8.1202 \"Competency Development in Public Health Leadership\"], ''American Journal of Public Health'', 2000</ref>\n\n==Target==\nUnlike the majority of leadership training programs, the PLA is tailored for young physicians at the beginning of their professional careers. By instilling the principles of leadership in this generation, they ensuring a sound foundation for their career development and are also giving these skills to the ones who are the most likely to make significant change in their communities and institutions.\n\n==Objectives==\n*\tBe inspired to work with, and advance treatment for, children with ADHD and their families\n*\tBe inspired to believe they can make a difference\n*\tUnderstand the dynamics and process of making large-scale health care system change and the incremental steps to doing so\n*\tUnderstand the functional, day-to-day behaviors of leadership\n*\tDevelop strategies for managing and resolving conflict\n*\tUnderstand the dynamics and importance of effective teams\n\n==Rationale==\nMost physicians are in positions of potential leadership. Reinertsen, in his article Physicians as Leaders in the Improvement of Health Care Systems,<ref>JL Reinertsen, [http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=711416 \"Physicians as Leaders in the Improvement of Health Care Systems\"], ''Annals of Internal Medicine'', 1998</ref> used a business-based definition of leadership, describing it as the ability to coordinate processes that begin an organization or facilitate an organization\u2019s adaptation to changing circumstances. Whether serving in an academic medical center, working as a physician executive in a health plan or public health program, functioning as a partner in a group practice, collaborating on a community project, or advocating for effective health legislation, physicians have multiple opportunities to function as leaders in changing health care in the 21st century.\n\nDespite these prospects, many physicians either have not taken on leadership roles or function ineffectively in those roles. Some have argued that the majority of administrative, organizational, team- building, and self-assessment skills of quality leaders are not taught in medical training programs. In fact, much of traditional medical curricula have emphasized autonomy in decision making, the individual physician-patient relationship, and hierarchical cultural processes that are counterproductive to effective leadership.<ref>R Schwartz, [http://academy.clevelandclinic.org/Portals/40/Physician%20leadership_Essential%20skills.pdf \"Physician Leadership: Essential Skills in a Changing Environment\"], ''The American Journal of Surgery'', 2000</ref> In addition, although leadership development programs have been implemented in many sectors of the economy and have been accompanied by a rapid proliferation of both a scholarly evaluation and the popular inspirational literature, medicine has tended to act as though leadership were an innate characteristic and not a skill to be learned. Until recently, physicians who were interested in acquiring leadership skills training have had to search for programs in industries outside medicine.\n\n==Principles==\nKouze's and Posner's Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership<ref>[http://www.leadershipchallenge.com Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership]</ref> model proves its effectiveness as a clear, evidence-based path to achieving the extraordinary\u2014for individuals, teams, organizations, and communities. It turns the abstract concept of leadership into easy-to-grasp practices and behaviors that can be taught and learned by anyone willing to step up and accept the challenge to lead.\n\n===Model the Way===\nLeaders establish principles concerning the way people (constituents, peers, colleagues, and customers alike) should be treated and the way goals should be pursued. They create standards of excellence and then set an example for others to follow. Because the prospect of complex change can overwhelm people and stifle action, they set interim goals so that people can achieve small wins as they work toward larger objectives. They unravel bureaucracy when it impedes action; they put up signposts when people are unsure of where to go or how to get there; and they create opportunities for victory.\n\n===Inspire a Shared Vision===\nLeaders passionately believe that they can make a difference. They envision the future, creating an ideal and unique image of what the organization can become. Through their magnetism and quiet persuasion, leaders enlist others in their dreams. They breathe life into their visions and get people to see exciting possibilities for the future.\n\n===Challenge the Process===\nLeaders search for opportunities to change the status quo. They look for innovative ways to improve the organization. In doing so, they experiment and take risks. And because leaders know that risk taking involves mistakes and failures, they accept the inevitable disappointments as learning opportunities.\n\n===Enable Others to Act===\nLeaders foster collaboration and build spirited teams. They actively involve others. Leaders understand that mutual respect is what sustains extraordinary efforts; they strive to create an atmosphere of trust and human dignity. They strengthen others, making each person feel capable and powerful.\n\n===Encourage the Heart===\nAccomplishing extraordinary things in organizations is hard work. To keep hope and determination alive, leaders recognize contributions that individuals make. In every winning team, the members need to share in the rewards of their efforts, so leaders celebrate accomplishments. They make people feel like heroes.\n\n==Impact==\nSince the PLA\u2019s inception in 1999, over 3000 pediatric professionals in the United States have been trained, as well as 150 pediatricians and family physicians trained in [[Saudi arabia|Saudi Arabia]] in a joint initiative \u2013  the Saudi PLA [http://pla.sa Saudi Pediatric Leadership Alliance] \u2013 between the AAP and the Saudi [[ADHD]] Society [http://adhd.org.sa Saudi ADHD Society].\n\n==References==\n <references/>\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://pla.sa Saudi Pediatric Leadership Alliance]\n* [http://adhd.org.sa Saudi ADHD Society]\n\n[[Category:Pediatrics in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Wbm1058", "label": "safe", "comment": "Spelling correction; redirect bypass fromSaudi arabiatoSaudi Arabiausingpopups", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatric_Leadership_Alliance"}

Although [[glucose]] is the preferred carbon source for most bacteria, the ''lac'' operon allows for the effective digestion of lactose when glucose is not available through the activity of [[beta-galactosidase]].<ref name=\"Freeman, W.H. & Company\">{{cite book|last1=Griffiths|first1=Anthony J.F.|last2=Wessler|first2=Susan R.|last3=Carroll|first3=Sean B.|last4=Doebley|first4=John|title=An Introduction to Genetic Analysis|date=2015|publisher=Freeman, W.H. & Company|isbn=9781464109485|pages=400\u2013412|edition=11}}</ref> [[Gene regulation]] of the ''lac'' operon was the first genetic regulatory mechanism to be understood clearly, so it has become a foremost example of [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] [[gene regulation]]. It is often discussed in introductory [[Molecular biology|molecular]] and [[cellular biology]] classes for this reason. This lactose metabolism system was used by [[Fran\u00e7ois Jacob]] and [[Jacques Monod]] to determine how a [[biological cell]] knows which enzyme to synthesize. Their work on the lac operon won them the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology]] in 1965.<ref name=\"Freeman, W.H. & Company\"/>\n\nBacterial operons are [[polycistronic]] [[Primary transcript|transcripts]] that are able to produce multiple proteins from one [[mRNA]] transcript. In this case, when lactose is required as a [[sugar]] source for the bacterium, the three genes of the lac operon can be expressed and their subsequent proteins translated: ''lacZ'', ''lacY'', and ''lacA''. The gene product of ''lacZ'' is [[Beta-galactosidase|\u03b2-galactosidase]] which cleaves lactose, a [[disaccharide]], into [[glucose]] and [[galactose]]. ''lacY'' encodes [[Beta-galactoside permease]], a [[membrane protein]] which becomes embedded in the [[cytoplasmic membrane]] to enable the [[cellular transport]] of lactose into the cell. Finally, ''lacA'' encodes [[Galactoside acetyltransferase]].\n\n[[Image:lac operon1.png|Layout of the ''lac'' operon.]]\n[[File:Lac Operon.svg|thumb|275px|Lac Operon|The ''lac'' operon.

The ''lac'' operon uses a two-part control mechanism to ensure that the cell expends energy producing the enzymes encoded by the ''lac'' operon only when necessary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~mcclean/plsc431/prokaryo/prokaryo1.htm|title=Prokaryotic Gene Expression|last=McClean|first=Phillip|date=1997|website=www.ndsu.edu|access-date=19 May 2017}}</ref> In the absence of lactose, the [[Lac repressor|''lac'' repressor]], ''lacI,'' halts production of the enzymes encoded by the ''lac'' operon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~mcclean/plsc431/prokaryo/prokaryo2.htm|title=Prokaryotic Gene Expression|website=www.ndsu.edu|access-date=19 May 2017}}</ref> The lac repressor is always expressed, unless a co-inducer binds to it. In other words, it is transcribed only in the presence of small molecule co-inducer. In the presence of glucose, the [[catabolite activator protein]] (CAP), required for production of the enzymes, remains inactive, and [[PEP group translocation|EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>]] shuts down lactose permease to prevent transport of lactose into the cell.  This dual control mechanism causes the sequential utilization of glucose and lactose in two distinct growth phases, known as [[diauxie]].\n\n== Structure ==\n[[Image:Lactose etc.png|thumb|300px|Structure of lactose and the products of its cleavage.]]\n\n*The ''lac'' operon consists of 3 [[structural gene]]s, and a [[promoter (biology)|promoter]], a [[terminator (genetics)|terminator]], [[Regulator gene|regulator]], and an [[operator (biology)|operator]]. The three structural genes are: ''lacZ'', ''lacY'', and ''lacA''.\n**''lacZ'' encodes [[Beta-galactosidase|\u03b2-galactosidase]] (LacZ), an intracellular [[enzyme]]  that cleaves the [[disaccharide]] [[lactose]] into [[glucose]] and [[galactose]].\n** ''lacY'' encodes [[Beta-galactoside permease]] (LacY),  a transmembrane [[symporter]] that pumps [[galactoside|\u03b2-galactosides]] including lactose into the cell using a proton gradient in the same direction. Permease increases the permeability of the cell to [[galactoside|\u03b2-galactosides]].\n** ''lacA'' encodes [[Beta-galactoside transacetylase|\u03b2-galactoside transacetylase]] (LacA), an enzyme that transfers an [[acetyl group]] from acetyl-CoA to \u03b2-galactosides.\n\nOnly ''lacZ'' and ''lacY'' appear to be necessary for lactose [[catabolism]].\n\n===Genetic nomenclature===\n\nThree-letter abbreviations are used to describe phenotypes in bacteria including ''E. coli''.\n\nExamples include:\n* Lac (the ability to use lactose),\n* His (the ability to synthesize the amino acid histidine)\n* Mot (swimming motility)\n* Sm<sup>R</sup> (resistance to the antibiotic [[streptomycin]])\n\nIn the case of Lac, wild type cells are Lac<sup>+</sup> and are able to use lactose as a carbon and energy source, while Lac<sup>\u2212</sup> mutant derivatives cannot use lactose.  The same three letters are typically used (lower-case, italicized) to label the genes involved in a particular phenotype, where each different gene is additionally distinguished by an extra letter.  The ''lac'' genes encoding enzymes are ''lacZ'', ''lacY'', and ''lacA''.  The fourth ''lac'' gene is ''lacI'', encoding the lactose repressor\u2014\"I\" stands for ''inducibility''.\n\nOne may distinguish between ''structural'' genes encoding enzymes, and regulatory genes encoding proteins that affect gene expression. Current usage expands the phenotypic nomenclature to apply to proteins:  thus, LacZ is the protein product of the ''lacZ'' gene, \u03b2-galactosidase.  Various short sequences that are not genes also affect gene expression, including the ''lac'' promoter, ''lac p'', and the ''lac'' operator, ''lac o''.  Although it is not strictly standard usage, mutations affecting ''lac o'' are referred to as ''lac o''<sup>c</sup>, for historical reasons.\n\n==Regulation==\nSpecific control of the ''lac'' genes depends on the availability of the [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] lactose to the bacterium. The proteins are not produced by the bacterium when lactose is unavailable as a carbon source.\nThe ''lac'' genes are organized into an [[operon]]; that is, they are oriented in the same direction immediately adjacent on the chromosome and are co-transcribed into a single [[polycistronic]] mRNA molecule.  Transcription of all genes starts with the binding of the enzyme [[RNA polymerase]] (RNAP), a [[DNA-binding protein]], which binds to a specific DNA binding site, the [[promoter (genetics)|promoter]], immediately [[upstream and downstream (DNA)|upstream]] of the genes. Binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter is aided by the [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]]-bound [[catabolite activator protein]] (CAP, also known as the cAMP receptor protein).<ref name=Busby2001>{{cite journal |author=Busby S., [[Richard H. Ebright|Ebright]] RH. |title=Transcription activation by catabolite activator protein (CAP) |journal=J. Mol. Biol. |volume=293 |issue=2 |pages=199\u2013213 |year=2001 |pmid=10550204 |doi=10.1006/jmbi.1999.3161}}</ref>  However, the ''lacI'' gene (regulatory gene for ''lac'' operon) produces a protein that blocks RNAP from binding to the promoter of the operon. This protein can only be removed when [[allolactose]] binds to it, and inactivates it. The protein that is formed by the ''lacI'' gene is known as the lac repressor. The type of regulation that the ''lac'' operon undergoes is referred to as negative inducible, meaning that the gene is turned off by the regulatory factor (''lac'' repressor) unless some molecule (lactose) is added. Because of the presence of the ''lac'' repressor protein, genetic engineers who replace the ''lacZ'' gene with another gene will have to grow the experimental bacteria on agar with lactose available on it. If they do not, the gene they are trying to express will not be expressed as the repressor protein is still blocking RNAP from binding to the promoter and transcribing the gene. Once the repressor is removed, RNAP then proceeds to transcribe all three genes (''lacZYA'') into mRNA. Each of the three genes on the mRNA strand has its own [[Shine-Dalgarno sequence]], so the genes are independently translated.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kennell |first1=David |last2=Riezman |first2=Howard |title=Transcription and translation initiation frequencies of the Escherichia coli lac operon |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |date = July 1977|volume=114 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201321 |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(77)90279-0 |pmid=409848 }}</ref> The DNA sequence of the ''[[E. coli]]'' lac [[operon]], the ''lacZYA'' [[mRNA]], and the ''lacI '' genes are available from [[GenBank]] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?db=nucleotide&val=146575 (view)].\n\nThe first control mechanism is the regulatory response to lactose, which uses an intracellular ''regulatory protein'' called the ''lactose repressor'' to hinder production of [[Beta-galactosidase|\u03b2-galactosidase]] in the absence of lactose.  The ''lacI'' gene coding for the repressor lies nearby the ''lac'' operon and is always expressed (''constitutive'').  If lactose is missing from the growth medium, the repressor binds very tightly to a short DNA sequence just downstream of the promoter near the beginning of ''lacZ'' called the ''lac operator''.  The repressor binding to the operator interferes with binding of RNAP to the promoter, and therefore mRNA encoding LacZ and LacY is only made at very low levels.  When cells are grown in the presence of lactose, however, a lactose metabolite called allolactose, made from lactose by the product of the ''lacZ'' gene, binds to the repressor, causing an allosteric shift.  Thus altered, the repressor is unable to bind to the operator, allowing RNAP to transcribe the ''lac'' genes and thereby leading to higher levels of the encoded proteins.\n\nThe second control mechanism is a response to glucose, which uses the [[catabolite activator protein]] (CAP) homodimer to greatly increase production of \u03b2-galactosidase in the absence of glucose. [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] (cAMP) is a signal molecule whose prevalence is inversely proportional to that of glucose. It binds to the CAP, which in turn allows the CAP to bind to the CAP binding site (a 16 bp DNA sequence upstream of the promoter on the left in the diagram below, about 60 bp upstream of the transcription start site),<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Malan |first1=T.

In the absence of glucose, the cAMP concentration is high and binding of CAP-cAMP to the DNA significantly increases the production of \u03b2-galactosidase, enabling the cell to [[hydrolysis|hydrolyse]] lactose and release galactose and glucose.\n\nMore recently inducer exclusion was shown to block expression of the ''lac'' operon when glucose is present.  Glucose is transported into the cell by the [[PEP group translocation|PEP-dependent phosphotransferase system]].  The phosphate group of [[Phosphoenolpyruvic acid|phosphoenolpyruvate]] is transferred via a phosphorylation cascade consisting of the general PTS (phosphotransferase system) proteins HPr and EIA and the glucose-specific PTS proteins EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> and EIIB<sup>Glc</sup>, the cytoplasmic domain of the EII glucose transporter.  Transport of glucose is accompanied by its phosphorylation by EIIB<sup>Glc</sup>, draining the phosphate group from the other PTS proteins, including EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>.  The unphosphorylated form of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> binds to the ''lac'' permease and prevents it from bringing lactose into the cell.  Therefore, if both glucose and lactose are present, the transport of glucose blocks the transport of the inducer of the ''lac'' operon.<ref name=Gorke2008>{{cite journal |vauthors=G\u00f6rke B, St\u00fclke J |title=Carbon catabolite repression in bacteria: many ways to make the most out of nutrients |journal=Nature Reviews.

These two functional subunits are coupled at the tetramerization region (labeled); thus, tetrameric ''LacI'' binds two operator sequences.  This allows tetrameric ''LacI'' to induce DNA looping.]]\n\nThe [[lac repressor]] is a four-part protein, a tetramer, with identical subunits.  Each subunit contains a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif capable of binding to DNA.  The operator site where repressor binds is a DNA sequence with inverted repeat symmetry.  The two DNA half-sites of the operator together bind to two of the subunits of the repressor.  Although the other two subunits of repressor are not doing anything in this model, this property was not understood for many years.\n\nEventually it was discovered that two additional operators are involved in ''lac'' regulation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Oehler | first1=S. | last2=Eismann | first2=E.

These two sites were not found in the early work because they have redundant functions and individual mutations do not affect repression very much.  Single mutations to either O<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>3</sub> have only 2 to 3-fold effects. However, their importance is demonstrated by the fact that a double mutant defective in both O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> is dramatically de-repressed (by about 70-fold).\n\nIn the current model, ''lac'' repressor is bound simultaneously to both the main operator O<sub>1</sub> and to either O<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>3</sub>.  The intervening DNA loops out from the complex.  The redundant nature of the two minor operators suggests that it is not a specific looped complex that is important. One idea is that the system works through tethering; if bound repressor releases from O<sub>1</sub> momentarily, binding to a minor operator keeps it in the vicinity, so that it may rebind quickly. This would increase the affinity of repressor for O<sub>1</sub>.\n\n====Mechanism of induction====\n[[File:Lac Operon.svg|thumb|250px|Lac Operon|'''''1'': RNA Polymerase, ''2'': Repressor, ''3'': Promoter, ''4'': Operator, ''5'': Lactose, ''6'': lacZ, ''7'': lacY, ''8'': lacA.\n''' '''Top''': The gene is essentially turned off.

Allolactose inhibits the repressor, allowing the RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter and express the genes, resulting in production of LacZYA.

The repressor will then bind to the operator, stopping the transcription of the LacZYA genes.]]\n\nThe repressor is an [[allosteric protein]], i.e. it can assume either one of two slightly different shapes, which are in equilibrium with each other.  In one form the repressor will bind to the operator DNA with high specificity, and in the other form it has lost its specificity.  According to the classical model of induction, binding of the inducer, either allolactose or IPTG, to the repressor affects the distribution of repressor between the two shapes.  Thus, repressor with inducer bound is stabilized in the non-DNA-binding conformation.  However, this simple model cannot be the whole story, because repressor is bound quite stably to DNA, yet it is released rapidly by addition of inducer.  Therefore, it seems clear that an inducer can also bind to the repressor when the repressor is already bound to DNA. It is still not entirely known what the exact mechanism of binding is.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Griffiths|first=Anthony JF|last2=Gelbart|first2=William M.|last3=Miller|first3=Jeffrey H.|last4=Lewontin|first4=Richard C.|date=1999|chapter=Regulation of the Lactose System|title=Modern Genetic Analysis|chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21402/|place=New York|publisher=W.

The specific binding site for the Lac-repressor protein is the operator. The non-specific interaction is mediated mainly by charge-charge interactions while binding to the operator is reinforced by hydrophobic interactions. Additionally, there is an abundance of non-specific DNA sequences to which the repressor can bind. Essentially, any sequence that is not the operator, is considered non-specific. Studies have shown, that without the presence of non-specific binding, induction (or unrepression) of the Lac-operon could not occur even with saturated levels of inducer. It had been demonstrated that, without non-specific binding, the basal level of induction is ten thousand times smaller than observed normally. This is because the non-specific DNA acts as sort of a \"sink\" for the repressor proteins, distracting them from the operator. The non-specific sequences decrease the amount of available repressor in the cell. This in turn reduces the amount of inducer required to unrepress the system.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=von Hippel |first1=P.H. |last2=Revzin |first2=A. |last3=Gross |first3=C.A. |last4=Wang |first4=A.C. |title=Non-specific DNA binding of genome regulating proteins as a biological control mechanism: I.

One advantage of IPTG for ''[[in vivo]]'' studies is that since it cannot be metabolized by ''E. coli'' its concentration remains constant and the rate of expression of ''lac p/o''-controlled genes, is not a variable in the experiment.

Since wild type cells produce very little \u03b2-galactosidase, they cannot grow on phenyl-Gal as a carbon and energy source.  Mutants lacking repressor are able to grow on phenyl-Gal.  Thus, minimal medium containing only phenyl-Gal as a source of carbon and energy is selective for repressor mutants and operator mutants.  If 10<sup>8</sup> cells of a wild type strain are plated on agar plates containing phenyl-Gal, the rare colonies which grow are mainly spontaneous mutants affecting the repressor.

Since the ''lacI gene'' encoding repressor is about 50 times larger than the operator, repressor mutants predominate in the selection.\n* [[Thiomethyl galactosidase]] [TMG] is another lactose analog. These inhibit the lacI repressor. At low inducer concentrations, both TMG and IPTG can enter the cell through the lactose permease.

Lactose is converted to allolactose by \u03b2-galactosidase in an alternative reaction to the hydrolytic one.  A physiological experiment which demonstrates the role of LacZ in production of the \"true\" inducer in ''E. coli'' cells is the observation that a null mutant of ''lacZ'' can still produce LacY permease when grown with IPTG, a non-hydrolyzable analog of allolactose, but not when grown with lactose.

The following section discusses how ''E. coli'' controls certain genes in response to metabolic needs.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Monod was testing the effects of combinations of sugars as nutrient sources for ''E. coli'' and [[Bacillus subtilis|''B. subtilis'']].  Monod was following up on similar studies that had been conducted by other scientists with bacteria and yeast.  He found that bacteria grown with two different sugars often displayed two phases of growth. For example, if glucose and lactose were both provided, glucose was metabolized first (growth phase I, see Figure 2) and then lactose (growth phase II).  Lactose was not metabolized during the first part of the diauxic growth curve because \u03b2-galactosidase was not made when both glucose and lactose were present in the medium.

A former soldier, Jacob used the analogy of a bomber that would release its lethal cargo upon receipt of a special radio transmission or signal.  A working system requires both a ground transmitter and a receiver in the airplane.  Now, suppose that the usual transmitter is broken.  This system can be made to work by introduction of a second, functional transmitter.  In contrast, he said, consider a bomber with a defective receiver.  The behavior of ''this'' bomber cannot be changed by introduction of a second, functional aeroplane.\n\nTo analyze regulatory mutants of the ''lac'' operon, Jacob developed a system by which a second copy of the ''lac'' genes (''lacI'' with its promoter, and ''lacZYA'' with promoter and operator) could be introduced into a single cell.  A culture of such bacteria, which are diploid for the ''lac'' genes but otherwise normal, is then tested for the regulatory phenotype.  In particular, it is determined whether LacZ and LacY are made even in the absence of IPTG (due to the ''lactose repressor'' produced by the mutant gene being non-functional).  This experiment, in which genes or gene clusters are tested pairwise, is called a [[Complementation (genetics)|''complementation test'']].\n[[Image:Lac complementation.png|center|500px]]\n\nThis test is illustrated in the figure (''lacA'' is omitted for simplicity).  First, certain haploid states are shown (i.e. the cell carries only a single copy of the ''lac'' genes).  Panel (a) shows repression, (b) shows induction by IPTG, and (c) and (d) show the effect of a mutation to the ''lacI'' gene or to the operator, respectively.  In panel (e) the complementation test for repressor is shown.  If one copy of the ''lac'' genes carries a mutation in ''lacI'', but the second copy is wild type for ''lacI'', the resulting phenotype is normal\u2014but lacZ is expressed when exposed to inducer IPTG.  Mutations affecting repressor are said to be ''recessive'' to wild type (and that wild type is ''dominant''), and this is explained by the fact that repressor is a small protein which can diffuse in the cell.  The copy of the ''lac'' operon adjacent to the defective ''lacI'' gene is effectively shut off by protein produced from the second copy of ''lacI''.\n\nIf the same experiment is carried out using an operator mutation, a different result is obtained (panel (f)).  The phenotype of a cell carrying one mutant and one wild type operator site is that LacZ and LacY are produced even in the absence of the inducer IPTG; because the damaged operator site, does not permit binding of the repressor to inhibit transcription of the structural genes.  The operator mutation is dominant.  When the operator site where repressor must bind is damaged by mutation, the presence of a second functional site in the same cell makes no difference to expression of genes controlled by the mutant site.\n\nA more sophisticated version of this experiment uses ''marked'' operons to distinguish between the two copies of the ''lac'' genes and show that the unregulated structural gene(s) is(are) the one(s) next to the mutant operator (panel (g).  For example, suppose that one copy is marked by a mutation inactivating ''lacZ'' so that it can only produce the LacY protein, while the second copy carries a mutation affecting ''lacY'' and can only produce LacZ.  In this version, only the copy of the ''lac'' operon that is adjacent to the mutant operator is expressed without IPTG.  We say that the operator mutation is ''cis-dominant'', it is dominant to wild type but affects only the copy of the operon which is immediately adjacent to it.\n\nThis explanation is misleading in an important sense, because it proceeds from a description of the experiment and then explains the results in terms of a model.  But in fact, it is often true that the model comes first, and an experiment is fashioned specifically to test the model.  Jacob and Monod first imagined that there must be a ''site'' in DNA with the properties of the operator, and then designed their complementation tests to show this.\n\nThe dominance of operator mutants also suggests a procedure to select them specifically.  If regulatory mutants are selected from a culture of wild type using phenyl-Gal, as described above, operator mutations are rare compared to repressor mutants because the target-size is so small.  But if instead we start with a strain which carries two copies of the whole ''lac'' region (that is diploid for ''lac''), the repressor mutations (which still occur) are not recovered because complementation by the second, wild type ''lacI'' gene confers a wild type phenotype.  In contrast, mutation of one copy of the operator confers a mutant phenotype because it is dominant to the second, wild type copy.\n\n===Regulation by cyclic AMP<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Montminy|first=M.|date=1997|title=Transcriptional regulation by cyclic AMP|journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry|volume=66|pages=807\u2013822|doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.66.1.807|issn=0066-4154|pmid=9242925}}</ref>===\n\nExplanation of diauxie depended on the characterization of additional mutations affecting the ''lac'' genes other than those explained by the classical model.  Two other genes, ''cya'' and ''crp'', subsequently were identified that mapped far from ''lac'', and that, when mutated, result in a decreased level of expression in the ''presence'' of IPTG and even in strains of the bacterium lacking the repressor or operator.  The discovery of [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] in ''E. coli'' led to the demonstration that mutants defective the ''cya'' gene but not the ''crp'' gene could be restored to full activity by the addition of cAMP to the medium.\n\nThe ''cya'' gene encodes adenylate cyclase, which produces cAMP.  In a ''cya'' mutant, the absence of cAMP makes the expression of the ''lacZYA'' genes more than ten times lower than normal.  Addition of cAMP corrects the low Lac expression characteristic of ''cya'' mutants.  The second gene, ''crp'', encodes a protein called [[catabolite activator protein]] (CAP) or [[cAMP receptor protein]] (CRP).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Botsford|first=J L|last2=Harman|first2=J G|date=March 1992|title=Cyclic AMP in prokaryotes.|journal=Microbiological Reviews|volume=56|issue=1|pages=100\u2013122|doi=10.1128/MMBR.56.1.100-122.1992|issn=0146-0749|pmid=1315922|pmc=372856}}</ref>\n\nHowever the lactose metabolism enzymes are made in small quantities in the presence of both glucose and lactose (sometimes called leaky expression) due to the fact that the LacI repressor rapidly associates/dissociates from the DNA rather than tightly binding to it, which can allow time for RNAP to bind and transcribe mRNAs of ''lacZYA''. Leaky expression is necessary in order to allow for metabolism of some lactose after the glucose source is expended, but before ''lac'' expression is fully activated.\n\nIn summary:\n\n* When lactose is absent then there is very little Lac enzyme production (the operator has Lac repressor bound to it).\n* When lactose is present but a preferred carbon source (like glucose) is also present then a small amount of enzyme is produced (Lac repressor is not bound to the operator).\n* When glucose is absent, CAP-cAMP binds to a specific DNA site upstream of the promoter and makes a direct protein-protein interaction with RNAP that facilitates the binding of RNAP to the promoter.\n\nThe delay between growth phases reflects the time needed to produce sufficient quantities of lactose-metabolizing enzymes.  First, the CAP regulatory protein has to assemble on the ''lac'' promoter, resulting in an increase in the production of ''lac'' [[mRNA]]. More available copies of the ''lac'' mRNA results in the production (see [[Translation (genetics)|translation]]) of significantly more copies of LacZ (\u03b2-galactosidase, for lactose metabolism) and LacY (lactose permease to transport lactose into the cell).  After a delay needed to increase the level of the lactose metabolizing enzymes, the bacteria enter into a new rapid phase of [[cell growth]].\n\n[[Image:Lac operon-2010-21-01.png|thumb|center|550px|''lac'' operon in detail]]\n\nTwo puzzles of [[catabolite repression]] relate to how cAMP levels are coupled to the presence of glucose, and secondly, why the cells should even bother.  After lactose is cleaved it actually forms glucose and galactose (easily converted to glucose).  In metabolic terms, lactose is just as ''good'' a carbon and energy source as glucose.  The cAMP level is related not to intracellular glucose concentration but to the rate of glucose transport, which influences the activity of adenylate cyclase.  (In addition, glucose transport also leads to direct inhibition of the lactose permease.)  As to why ''E. coli'' works this way, one can only speculate.  All enteric bacteria ferment glucose, which suggests they encounter it frequently.  It is possible that a small difference in efficiency of transport or metabolism of glucose v. lactose makes it advantageous for cells to regulate the ''lac'' operon in this way.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Vazquez A, Beg QK, Demenezes MA, etal |title=Impact of the solvent capacity constraint on E. coli metabolism |journal=BMC Syst Biol |volume=2 |pages=7 |year=2008 |pmid=18215292 |pmc=2270259 |doi=10.1186/1752-0509-2-7 }}</ref>\n\n==Use in molecular biology==\n\nThe ''lac'' gene and its derivatives are amenable to use as a [[reporter gene]] in a number of bacterial-based selection techniques such as [[two hybrid]] analysis, in which the successful binding of a [[transcriptional activator]] to a specific promoter sequence must be determined.<ref name=\"joung\"/> In [[Luria-Bertani broth|LB]] plates containing [[X-gal]], the colour change from white colonies to a shade of blue corresponds to about 20\u2013100 \u03b2-galactosidase units, while [[tetrazolium]] lactose and [[MacConkey agar|MacConkey lactose media]] have a range of 100\u20131000 units, being most sensitive in the high and low parts of this range respectively.<ref name=\"joung\"/> Since MacConkey lactose and tetrazolium lactose media both rely on the products of lactose breakdown, they require the presence of both ''lacZ'' and ''lacY'' genes.

This lactose metabolism system was used by [[Fran\u00e7ois Jacob]] and [[Jacques Monod]] to determine how a [[biological cell]] knows which enzyme to synthesize. Their work on the lac operon won them the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology]] in 1965.<ref name=\"Freeman, W.H. & Company\"/>\n\nBacterial operons are [[polycistronic]] [[Primary transcript|transcripts]] that are able to produce multiple proteins from one [[mRNA]] transcript. In this case, when lactose is required as a [[sugar]] source for the bacterium, the three genes of the lac operon can be expressed and their subsequent proteins translated: ''lacZ'', ''lacY'', and ''lacA''. The gene product of ''lacZ'' is [[Beta-galactosidase|\u03b2-galactosidase]] which cleaves lactose, a [[disaccharide]], into [[glucose]] and [[galactose]]. ''lacY'' encodes [[Beta-galactoside permease]], a [[membrane protein]] which becomes embedded in the [[cytoplasmic membrane]] to enable the [[cellular transport]] of lactose into the cell. Finally, ''lacA'' encodes [[Galactoside acetyltransferase]].\n\n[[Image:lac operon1.png|Layout of the ''lac'' operon.]]\n[[File:Lac Operon.svg|thumb|275px|Lac Operon|The ''lac'' operon.

In the presence of glucose, the [[catabolite activator protein]] (CAP), required for production of the enzymes, remains inactive, and [[PEP group translocation|EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>]] shuts down lactose permease to prevent transport of lactose into the cell.  This dual control mechanism causes the sequential utilization of glucose and lactose in two distinct growth phases, known as [[diauxie]].\n\n== Structure ==\n[[Image:Lactose etc.png|thumb|300px|Structure of lactose and the products of its cleavage.]]\n\n*The ''lac'' operon consists of 3 [[structural gene]]s, and a [[promoter (biology)|promoter]], a [[terminator (genetics)|terminator]], [[Regulator gene|regulator]], and an [[operator (biology)|operator]]. The three structural genes are: ''lacZ'', ''lacY'', and ''lacA''.\n**''lacZ'' encodes [[Beta-galactosidase|\u03b2-galactosidase]] (LacZ), an intracellular [[enzyme]]  that cleaves the [[disaccharide]] [[lactose]] into [[glucose]] and [[galactose]].\n** ''lacY'' encodes [[Beta-galactoside permease]] (LacY),  a transmembrane [[symporter]] that pumps [[galactoside|\u03b2-galactosides]] including lactose into the cell using a proton gradient in the same direction. Permease increases the permeability of the cell to [[galactoside|\u03b2-galactosides]].\n** ''lacA'' encodes [[Beta-galactoside transacetylase|\u03b2-galactoside transacetylase]] (LacA), an enzyme that transfers an [[acetyl group]] from acetyl-CoA to \u03b2-galactosides.\n\nOnly ''lacZ'' and ''lacY'' appear to be necessary for lactose [[catabolism]].\n\n===Genetic nomenclature===\n\nThree-letter abbreviations are used to describe phenotypes in bacteria including ''E. coli''.\n\nExamples include:\n* Lac (the ability to use lactose),\n* His (the ability to synthesize the amino acid histidine)\n* Mot (swimming motility)\n* Sm<sup>R</sup> (resistance to the antibiotic [[streptomycin]])\n\nIn the case of Lac, wild type cells are Lac<sup>+</sup> and are able to use lactose as a carbon and energy source, while Lac<sup>\u2212</sup> mutant derivatives cannot use lactose.  The same three letters are typically used (lower-case, italicized) to label the genes involved in a particular phenotype, where each different gene is additionally distinguished by an extra letter.  The ''lac'' genes encoding enzymes are ''lacZ'', ''lacY'', and ''lacA''.  The fourth ''lac'' gene is ''lacI'', encoding the lactose repressor\u2014\"I\" stands for ''inducibility''.\n\nOne may distinguish between ''structural'' genes encoding enzymes, and regulatory genes encoding proteins that affect gene expression. Current usage expands the phenotypic nomenclature to apply to proteins:  thus, LacZ is the protein product of the ''lacZ'' gene, \u03b2-galactosidase.  Various short sequences that are not genes also affect gene expression, including the ''lac'' promoter, ''lac p'', and the ''lac'' operator, ''lac o''.  Although it is not strictly standard usage, mutations affecting ''lac o'' are referred to as ''lac o''<sup>c</sup>, for historical reasons.\n\n==Regulation==\nSpecific control of the ''lac'' genes depends on the availability of the [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] lactose to the bacterium. The proteins are not produced by the bacterium when lactose is unavailable as a carbon source.\nThe ''lac'' genes are organized into an [[operon]]; that is, they are oriented in the same direction immediately adjacent on the chromosome and are co-transcribed into a single [[polycistronic]] mRNA molecule.  Transcription of all genes starts with the binding of the enzyme [[RNA polymerase]] (RNAP), a [[DNA-binding protein]], which binds to a specific DNA binding site, the [[promoter (genetics)|promoter]], immediately [[upstream and downstream (DNA)|upstream]] of the genes. Binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter is aided by the [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]]-bound [[catabolite activator protein]] (CAP, also known as the cAMP receptor protein).<ref name=Busby2001>{{cite journal |author=Busby S., [[Richard H.

This protein can only be removed when [[allolactose]] binds to it, and inactivates it. The protein that is formed by the ''lacI'' gene is known as the lac repressor. The type of regulation that the ''lac'' operon undergoes is referred to as negative inducible, meaning that the gene is turned off by the regulatory factor (''lac'' repressor) unless some molecule (lactose) is added. Because of the presence of the ''lac'' repressor protein, genetic engineers who replace the ''lacZ'' gene with another gene will have to grow the experimental bacteria on agar with lactose available on it. If they do not, the gene they are trying to express will not be expressed as the repressor protein is still blocking RNAP from binding to the promoter and transcribing the gene. Once the repressor is removed, RNAP then proceeds to transcribe all three genes (''lacZYA'') into mRNA. Each of the three genes on the mRNA strand has its own [[Shine-Dalgarno sequence]], so the genes are independently translated.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kennell |first1=David |last2=Riezman |first2=Howard |title=Transcription and translation initiation frequencies of the Escherichia coli lac operon |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |date = July 1977|volume=114 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201321 |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(77)90279-0 |pmid=409848 }}</ref> The DNA sequence of the ''[[E. coli]]'' lac [[operon]], the ''lacZYA'' [[mRNA]], and the ''lacI '' genes are available from [[GenBank]] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?db=nucleotide&val=146575 (view)].\n\nThe first control mechanism is the regulatory response to lactose, which uses an intracellular ''regulatory protein'' called the ''lactose repressor'' to hinder production of [[Beta-galactosidase|\u03b2-galactosidase]] in the absence of lactose.  The ''lacI'' gene coding for the repressor lies nearby the ''lac'' operon and is always expressed (''constitutive'').  If lactose is missing from the growth medium, the repressor binds very tightly to a short DNA sequence just downstream of the promoter near the beginning of ''lacZ'' called the ''lac operator''.  The repressor binding to the operator interferes with binding of RNAP to the promoter, and therefore mRNA encoding LacZ and LacY is only made at very low levels.  When cells are grown in the presence of lactose, however, a lactose metabolite called allolactose, made from lactose by the product of the ''lacZ'' gene, binds to the repressor, causing an allosteric shift.  Thus altered, the repressor is unable to bind to the operator, allowing RNAP to transcribe the ''lac'' genes and thereby leading to higher levels of the encoded proteins.\n\nThe second control mechanism is a response to glucose, which uses the [[catabolite activator protein]] (CAP) homodimer to greatly increase production of \u03b2-galactosidase in the absence of glucose. [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] (cAMP) is a signal molecule whose prevalence is inversely proportional to that of glucose. It binds to the CAP, which in turn allows the CAP to bind to the CAP binding site (a 16 bp DNA sequence upstream of the promoter on the left in the diagram below, about 60 bp upstream of the transcription start site),<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Malan |first1=T.

In the absence of glucose, the cAMP concentration is high and binding of CAP-cAMP to the DNA significantly increases the production of \u03b2-galactosidase, enabling the cell to [[hydrolysis|hydrolyse]] lactose and release galactose and glucose.\n\nMore recently inducer exclusion was shown to block expression of the ''lac'' operon when glucose is present.  Glucose is transported into the cell by the [[PEP group translocation|PEP-dependent phosphotransferase system]].  The phosphate group of [[Phosphoenolpyruvic acid|phosphoenolpyruvate]] is transferred via a phosphorylation cascade consisting of the general PTS (phosphotransferase system) proteins HPr and EIA and the glucose-specific PTS proteins EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> and EIIB<sup>Glc</sup>, the cytoplasmic domain of the EII glucose transporter.  Transport of glucose is accompanied by its phosphorylation by EIIB<sup>Glc</sup>, draining the phosphate group from the other PTS proteins, including EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>.  The unphosphorylated form of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> binds to the ''lac'' permease and prevents it from bringing lactose into the cell.  Therefore, if both glucose and lactose are present, the transport of glucose blocks the transport of the inducer of the ''lac'' operon.<ref name=Gorke2008>{{cite journal |vauthors=G\u00f6rke B, St\u00fclke J |title=Carbon catabolite repression in bacteria: many ways to make the most out of nutrients |journal=Nature Reviews.

Two dimeric ''LacI'' functional subunits (red+blue and green+orange) each bind a DNA operator sequence (labeled).  These two functional subunits are coupled at the tetramerization region (labeled); thus, tetrameric ''LacI'' binds two operator sequences.  This allows tetrameric ''LacI'' to induce DNA looping.]]\n\nThe [[lac repressor]] is a four-part protein, a tetramer, with identical subunits.  Each subunit contains a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif capable of binding to DNA.  The operator site where repressor binds is a DNA sequence with inverted repeat symmetry.  The two DNA half-sites of the operator together bind to two of the subunits of the repressor.  Although the other two subunits of repressor are not doing anything in this model, this property was not understood for many years.\n\nEventually it was discovered that two additional operators are involved in ''lac'' regulation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Oehler | first1=S. | last2=Eismann | first2=E.

These two sites were not found in the early work because they have redundant functions and individual mutations do not affect repression very much.  Single mutations to either O<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>3</sub> have only 2 to 3-fold effects. However, their importance is demonstrated by the fact that a double mutant defective in both O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> is dramatically de-repressed (by about 70-fold).\n\nIn the current model, ''lac'' repressor is bound simultaneously to both the main operator O<sub>1</sub> and to either O<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>3</sub>.  The intervening DNA loops out from the complex.  The redundant nature of the two minor operators suggests that it is not a specific looped complex that is important. One idea is that the system works through tethering; if bound repressor releases from O<sub>1</sub> momentarily, binding to a minor operator keeps it in the vicinity, so that it may rebind quickly. This would increase the affinity of repressor for O<sub>1</sub>.\n\n====Mechanism of induction====\n[[File:Lac Operon.svg|thumb|250px|Lac Operon|'''''1'': RNA Polymerase, ''2'': Repressor, ''3'': Promoter, ''4'': Operator, ''5'': Lactose, ''6'': lacZ, ''7'': lacY, ''8'': lacA.\n''' '''Top''': The gene is essentially turned off. There is no allolactose to inhibit the ''lac'' repressor, so the repressor binds tightly to the operator, which obstructs the RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter, resulting in no ''laczya'' mRNA transcripts.\n'''Bottom''': The gene is turned on. Allolactose inhibits the repressor, allowing the RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter and express the genes, resulting in production of LacZYA. Eventually, the enzymes will digest all of the lactose, until there is no allolactose that can bind to the repressor. The repressor will then bind to the operator, stopping the transcription of the LacZYA genes.]]\n\nThe repressor is an [[allosteric protein]], i.e. it can assume either one of two slightly different shapes, which are in equilibrium with each other.  In one form the repressor will bind to the operator DNA with high specificity, and in the other form it has lost its specificity.  According to the classical model of induction, binding of the inducer, either allolactose or IPTG, to the repressor affects the distribution of repressor between the two shapes.  Thus, repressor with inducer bound is stabilized in the non-DNA-binding conformation.  However, this simple model cannot be the whole story, because repressor is bound quite stably to DNA, yet it is released rapidly by addition of inducer.  Therefore, it seems clear that an inducer can also bind to the repressor when the repressor is already bound to DNA. It is still not entirely known what the exact mechanism of binding is.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Griffiths|first=Anthony JF|last2=Gelbart|first2=William M.|last3=Miller|first3=Jeffrey H.|last4=Lewontin|first4=Richard C.|date=1999|chapter=Regulation of the Lactose System|title=Modern Genetic Analysis|chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21402/|place=New York|publisher=W.

The specific binding site for the Lac-repressor protein is the operator. The non-specific interaction is mediated mainly by charge-charge interactions while binding to the operator is reinforced by hydrophobic interactions. Additionally, there is an abundance of non-specific DNA sequences to which the repressor can bind. Essentially, any sequence that is not the operator, is considered non-specific. Studies have shown, that without the presence of non-specific binding, induction (or unrepression) of the Lac-operon could not occur even with saturated levels of inducer. It had been demonstrated that, without non-specific binding, the basal level of induction is ten thousand times smaller than observed normally. This is because the non-specific DNA acts as sort of a \"sink\" for the repressor proteins, distracting them from the operator. The non-specific sequences decrease the amount of available repressor in the cell. This in turn reduces the amount of inducer required to unrepress the system.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=von Hippel |first1=P.H. |last2=Revzin |first2=A. |last3=Gross |first3=C.A. |last4=Wang |first4=A.C. |title=Non-specific DNA binding of genome regulating proteins as a biological control mechanism: I.

One advantage of IPTG for ''[[in vivo]]'' studies is that since it cannot be metabolized by ''E. coli'' its concentration remains constant and the rate of expression of ''lac p/o''-controlled genes, is not a variable in the experiment.

Since wild type cells produce very little \u03b2-galactosidase, they cannot grow on phenyl-Gal as a carbon and energy source.  Mutants lacking repressor are able to grow on phenyl-Gal.  Thus, minimal medium containing only phenyl-Gal as a source of carbon and energy is selective for repressor mutants and operator mutants.  If 10<sup>8</sup> cells of a wild type strain are plated on agar plates containing phenyl-Gal, the rare colonies which grow are mainly spontaneous mutants affecting the repressor.  The relative distribution of repressor and operator mutants is affected by the target size. Since the ''lacI gene'' encoding repressor is about 50 times larger than the operator, repressor mutants predominate in the selection.\n* [[Thiomethyl galactosidase]] [TMG] is another lactose analog. These inhibit the lacI repressor. At low inducer concentrations, both TMG and IPTG can enter the cell through the lactose permease.

Lactose is converted to allolactose by \u03b2-galactosidase in an alternative reaction to the hydrolytic one.  A physiological experiment which demonstrates the role of LacZ in production of the \"true\" inducer in ''E. coli'' cells is the observation that a null mutant of ''lacZ'' can still produce LacY permease when grown with IPTG, a non-hydrolyzable analog of allolactose, but not when grown with lactose.

Monod was following up on similar studies that had been conducted by other scientists with bacteria and yeast.  He found that bacteria grown with two different sugars often displayed two phases of growth. For example, if glucose and lactose were both provided, glucose was metabolized first (growth phase I, see Figure 2) and then lactose (growth phase II).  Lactose was not metabolized during the first part of the diauxic growth curve because \u03b2-galactosidase was not made when both glucose and lactose were present in the medium.

A former soldier, Jacob used the analogy of a bomber that would release its lethal cargo upon receipt of a special radio transmission or signal.  A working system requires both a ground transmitter and a receiver in the airplane.  Now, suppose that the usual transmitter is broken.  This system can be made to work by introduction of a second, functional transmitter.  In contrast, he said, consider a bomber with a defective receiver.  The behavior of ''this'' bomber cannot be changed by introduction of a second, functional aeroplane.\n\nTo analyze regulatory mutants of the ''lac'' operon, Jacob developed a system by which a second copy of the ''lac'' genes (''lacI'' with its promoter, and ''lacZYA'' with promoter and operator) could be introduced into a single cell.  A culture of such bacteria, which are diploid for the ''lac'' genes but otherwise normal, is then tested for the regulatory phenotype.  In particular, it is determined whether LacZ and LacY are made even in the absence of IPTG (due to the ''lactose repressor'' produced by the mutant gene being non-functional).  This experiment, in which genes or gene clusters are tested pairwise, is called a [[Complementation (genetics)|''complementation test'']].\n[[Image:Lac complementation.png|center|500px]]\n\nThis test is illustrated in the figure (''lacA'' is omitted for simplicity).  First, certain haploid states are shown (i.e. the cell carries only a single copy of the ''lac'' genes).  Panel (a) shows repression, (b) shows induction by IPTG, and (c) and (d) show the effect of a mutation to the ''lacI'' gene or to the operator, respectively.  In panel (e) the complementation test for repressor is shown.  If one copy of the ''lac'' genes carries a mutation in ''lacI'', but the second copy is wild type for ''lacI'', the resulting phenotype is normal\u2014but lacZ is expressed when exposed to inducer IPTG.  Mutations affecting repressor are said to be ''recessive'' to wild type (and that wild type is ''dominant''), and this is explained by the fact that repressor is a small protein which can diffuse in the cell.  The copy of the ''lac'' operon adjacent to the defective ''lacI'' gene is effectively shut off by protein produced from the second copy of ''lacI''.\n\nIf the same experiment is carried out using an operator mutation, a different result is obtained (panel (f)).  The phenotype of a cell carrying one mutant and one wild type operator site is that LacZ and LacY are produced even in the absence of the inducer IPTG; because the damaged operator site, does not permit binding of the repressor to inhibit transcription of the structural genes.  The operator mutation is dominant.  When the operator site where repressor must bind is damaged by mutation, the presence of a second functional site in the same cell makes no difference to expression of genes controlled by the mutant site.\n\nA more sophisticated version of this experiment uses ''marked'' operons to distinguish between the two copies of the ''lac'' genes and show that the unregulated structural gene(s) is(are) the one(s) next to the mutant operator (panel (g).  For example, suppose that one copy is marked by a mutation inactivating ''lacZ'' so that it can only produce the LacY protein, while the second copy carries a mutation affecting ''lacY'' and can only produce LacZ.  In this version, only the copy of the ''lac'' operon that is adjacent to the mutant operator is expressed without IPTG.  We say that the operator mutation is ''cis-dominant'', it is dominant to wild type but affects only the copy of the operon which is immediately adjacent to it.\n\nThis explanation is misleading in an important sense, because it proceeds from a description of the experiment and then explains the results in terms of a model.  But in fact, it is often true that the model comes first, and an experiment is fashioned specifically to test the model.  Jacob and Monod first imagined that there must be a ''site'' in DNA with the properties of the operator, and then designed their complementation tests to show this.\n\nThe dominance of operator mutants also suggests a procedure to select them specifically.  If regulatory mutants are selected from a culture of wild type using phenyl-Gal, as described above, operator mutations are rare compared to repressor mutants because the target-size is so small.  But if instead we start with a strain which carries two copies of the whole ''lac'' region (that is diploid for ''lac''), the repressor mutations (which still occur) are not recovered because complementation by the second, wild type ''lacI'' gene confers a wild type phenotype.  In contrast, mutation of one copy of the operator confers a mutant phenotype because it is dominant to the second, wild type copy.\n\n===Regulation by cyclic AMP<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Montminy|first=M.|date=1997|title=Transcriptional regulation by cyclic AMP|journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry|volume=66|pages=807\u2013822|doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.66.1.807|issn=0066-4154|pmid=9242925}}</ref>===\n\nExplanation of diauxie depended on the characterization of additional mutations affecting the ''lac'' genes other than those explained by the classical model.  Two other genes, ''cya'' and ''crp'', subsequently were identified that mapped far from ''lac'', and that, when mutated, result in a decreased level of expression in the ''presence'' of IPTG and even in strains of the bacterium lacking the repressor or operator.  The discovery of [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] in ''E. coli'' led to the demonstration that mutants defective the ''cya'' gene but not the ''crp'' gene could be restored to full activity by the addition of cAMP to the medium.\n\nThe ''cya'' gene encodes adenylate cyclase, which produces cAMP.  In a ''cya'' mutant, the absence of cAMP makes the expression of the ''lacZYA'' genes more than ten times lower than normal.  Addition of cAMP corrects the low Lac expression characteristic of ''cya'' mutants.  The second gene, ''crp'', encodes a protein called [[catabolite activator protein]] (CAP) or [[cAMP receptor protein]] (CRP).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Botsford|first=J L|last2=Harman|first2=J G|date=March 1992|title=Cyclic AMP in prokaryotes.|journal=Microbiological Reviews|volume=56|issue=1|pages=100\u2013122|doi=10.1128/MMBR.56.1.100-122.1992|issn=0146-0749|pmid=1315922|pmc=372856}}</ref>\n\nHowever the lactose metabolism enzymes are made in small quantities in the presence of both glucose and lactose (sometimes called leaky expression) due to the fact that the LacI repressor rapidly associates/dissociates from the DNA rather than tightly binding to it, which can allow time for RNAP to bind and transcribe mRNAs of ''lacZYA''. Leaky expression is necessary in order to allow for metabolism of some lactose after the glucose source is expended, but before ''lac'' expression is fully activated.\n\nIn summary:\n\n* When lactose is absent then there is very little Lac enzyme production (the operator has Lac repressor bound to it).\n* When lactose is present but a preferred carbon source (like glucose) is also present then a small amount of enzyme is produced (Lac repressor is not bound to the operator).\n* When glucose is absent, CAP-cAMP binds to a specific DNA site upstream of the promoter and makes a direct protein-protein interaction with RNAP that facilitates the binding of RNAP to the promoter.\n\nThe delay between growth phases reflects the time needed to produce sufficient quantities of lactose-metabolizing enzymes.  First, the CAP regulatory protein has to assemble on the ''lac'' promoter, resulting in an increase in the production of ''lac'' [[mRNA]]. More available copies of the ''lac'' mRNA results in the production (see [[Translation (genetics)|translation]]) of significantly more copies of LacZ (\u03b2-galactosidase, for lactose metabolism) and LacY (lactose permease to transport lactose into the cell).  After a delay needed to increase the level of the lactose metabolizing enzymes, the bacteria enter into a new rapid phase of [[cell growth]].\n\n[[Image:Lac operon-2010-21-01.png|thumb|center|550px|''lac'' operon in detail]]\n\nTwo puzzles of [[catabolite repression]] relate to how cAMP levels are coupled to the presence of glucose, and secondly, why the cells should even bother.  After lactose is cleaved it actually forms glucose and galactose (easily converted to glucose).  In metabolic terms, lactose is just as ''good'' a carbon and energy source as glucose.  The cAMP level is related not to intracellular glucose concentration but to the rate of glucose transport, which influences the activity of adenylate cyclase.  (In addition, glucose transport also leads to direct inhibition of the lactose permease.)  As to why ''E. coli'' works this way, one can only speculate.  All enteric bacteria ferment glucose, which suggests they encounter it frequently.

He served several terms as a [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Councillor]] and was the second chairman of the [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] (DP), a pro-democracy political party in Hong Kong. He is a lecturer in at the [[University of Hong Kong]].\n\n==Biography==\nYeung Sum obtained his undergraduate degree at the [[University of Hong Kong]]. He was a residential member in ''St. John's College'' and became the president of its student association from 1972\u20131973. He gained his master's degree at the [[University of York]] in Britain before returning to earn his doctorate from the University of Hong Kong. Yeung Sum has taught at the University of Hong Kong since 1979 and has been a lecturer in the Department of Social Work and Social Administration since 1985.\n\nWhen the issue of Hong Kong sovereignty after 1997 came up in 1983, Yeung and some graduates from the University of Hong Kong founded [[Meeting Point]], the first political organisation supporting Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty. During the drafting of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], he pushed for a democratic model for Hong Kong after 1997. He was the second chairman of the group from 1988 to 1989. He also formed the [[Joint Committee on the Promotion of Democratic Government]] with liberal-minded drafters [[Martin Lee]] and [[Szeto Wah]] and became the spokesman of the committee. he was a committee member of the [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China]] during the [[Tiananmen protests of 1989]] and remained critical of the Chinese government after the bloody crackdown.\n\nIn 1990, he became the founding vice-chairman of the [[United Democrats of Hong Kong]], the first pro-democracy party and filled candidates in the [[1991 Hong Kong local elections|District Board elections]] and [[1991 Hong Kong municipal elections|Urban and Regional Councils elections]]. In the [[1991 Hong Kong legislative election|first Legislative Council direct election]], he was directly elected through the [[Hong Kong Island (constituency)#1991 Constituencies|Island West]] constituency. He became the vice-chairman of the [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] when the United Democrats and Meeting Point merged in 1994.\n\nYeung remained legislator until the legislature was dissolved in 1997 when Hong Kong was handed over to China. He was re-elected to the Legislative Council in the [[1998 Hong Kong legislative election|1998 LegCo election]] and remained in the LegCo until he stepped down as the second place on the party's candidate list in 2008 behind [[Kam Nai-wai]].\n\nYeung represented the Mainstreamers, a relatively moderate faction, within the democratic camp, and discontent with him within the Democrats led to splits within the party. When Yeung took the chairmanship from Martin Lee in 2002, legislator [[Albert Chan]] quit the party, and the following year a number of \"Young Turks\" left the party to join [[The Frontier (Hong Kong)|The Frontier]]. In 2004, taking responsibility for recent [[2004 Hong Kong legislative election|election failures]], he announced that he would seek another term as party chairman. He has remained on the party's central committee and executive committees occasionally.\n\nOn 28 February 2020, Yeung was arrested over his involvement in a march on 31 August 2019 which was part of\n[[2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests|protests sparked by the extradition bill]], and had been classified by police\nas illegal assembly.

The platelet Gs protein-coupled receptor ([[prostacyclin receptor]]) is activated when it binds to PGI<sub>2</sub>. This activation, in turn, signals adenylyl cyclase to produce [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]]. cAMP goes on to inhibit any undue platelet activation (in order to promote circulation) and also counteracts any increase in cytosolic calcium levels that would result from [[thromboxane A2]] (TXA<sub>2</sub>) binding (leading to platelet activation and subsequent [[coagulation]]). PGI<sub>2</sub> also binds to endothelial [[prostacyclin receptor]]s, and in the same manner, raises cAMP levels in the cytosol. This cAMP then goes on to activate [[protein kinase A]] (PKA). PKA then continues the cascade by promoting the phosphorylation of the [[myosin light chain kinase]], which inhibits it and leads to [[smooth muscle]] relaxation and [[vasodilation]]. It can be noted that PGI<sub>2</sub> and TXA<sub>2</sub> work as physiological antagonists.\n\n==Members<ref>^ REM_RefGuideWC_AUG07v.1</ref>==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

These convert [[arachidonic acid]] to [[prostaglandin H2]] (PGH<sub>2</sub>), the immediate precursor of prostacyclin.  Since thromboxane (an [[eicosanoid]] stimulator of platelet aggregation) is also downstream of COX enzymes, one might think that the effect of NSAIDs would act to balance.  However, prostacyclin concentrations recover much faster than thromboxane levels, so aspirin administration initially has little to no effect but eventually prevents platelet aggregation (the effect of prostaglandins predominates as they are regenerated). This is explained by understanding the cells that produce each molecule, TXA<sub>2</sub> and PGI<sub>2</sub>. Since PGI<sub>2</sub> is primarily produced in a nucleated endothelial cell, the COX inhibition by NSAID can be overcome with time by increased COX gene activation and subsequent production of more COX enzymes to [[catalyze]] the formation of PGI<sub>2</sub>. In contrast, TXA<sub>2</sub> is released primarily by anucleated platelets, which are unable to respond to NSAID COX inhibition with additional [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of the COX gene because they lack [[DNA]] material necessary to perform such a task. This allows NSAIDs to result in PGI<sub>2</sub> dominance that promotes circulation and retards [[thrombosis]].\n\nIn patients with [[pulmonary hypertension]], inhaled epoprostenol reduces pulmonary pressure, and improves right ventricular [[stroke volume]] in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

Working with a team from the [[Royal College of Surgeons]], Vane discovered that aspirin and other oral anti-inflammatory drugs work by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins. This critical finding opened the door to a broader understanding of the role of prostaglandins in the body.\n\nA team at The Wellcome Foundation led by Salvador Moncada had identified a lipid mediator they called \"PG-X,\" which inhibits platelet aggregation. PG-X, later known as prostacyclin, is 30 times more potent than any other then-known anti-aggregatory agent.\n\nIn 1976, Vane and fellow researchers [[Salvador Moncada]], [[Ryszard Gryglewski]], and [[Stuart Bunting]] published the first paper on prostacyclin in  ''Nature''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Moncada |first=S. |author2=Gryglewski, R. |author3=Bunting, S. |author4= Vane, J.

Working with a team from the [[Royal College of Surgeons]], Vane discovered that aspirin and other oral anti-inflammatory drugs work by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins. This critical finding opened the door to a broader understanding of the role of prostaglandins in the body.\n\nA team at The Wellcome Foundation led by Salvador Moncada had identified a lipid mediator they called \"PG-X,\" which inhibits platelet aggregation. PG-X, later known as prostacyclin, is 30 times more potent than any other then-known anti-aggregatory agent.\n\nIn 1976, Vane and fellow researchers [[Salvador Moncada]], [[Ryszard Gryglewski]], and [[Stuart Bunting]] published the first paper on prostacyclin in  ''Nature''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Moncada |first=S. |author2=Gryglewski, R. |author3=Bunting, S. |author4= Vane, J.

But, as with native prostacyclin, the epoprostenol molecule is unstable in solution and prone to rapid degradation.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}  This presented a challenge for both in vitro experiments and clinical applications.\n  \nTo overcome this challenge, the research team that discovered prostacyclin continued the research. The research team synthesized nearly 1,000 analogues.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Essential fatty acid]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Antithrombotics}}\n{{PAH rx}}\n{{Prostaglandins}}\n{{Prostanoidergics}}\n\n[[Category:Prostaglandins]]\n[[Category:Gilead Sciences]]\n[[Category:Johnson & Johnson brands]]\n[[Category:Secondary alcohols]]\n[[Category:Carboxylic acids]]\n", "name_user": "Fswitzer4", "label": "safe", "comment": "added FDA UNII to drug box", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostacyclin"}
