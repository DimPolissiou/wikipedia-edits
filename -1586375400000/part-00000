As with the title, the album heralds the end of the 'Nightmare' concept. This overarching theme the group has been promoting in their past title songs since their debut single 'Chase Me' has finally ended and culminated in their new single - 'PIRI', a song showcasing Dreamcatcher's signature rock acoustics and incorporation of music from its [[Piri|namesake musical instrument]]. On the same day, Dreamcatcher's agency, HappyFace Entertainment, also announced that they will henceforth be renamed as DreamCatcher Company.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=108&aid=0002761004|title=\ub4dc\ub9bc\uce90\uccd0 \uc9c0\uc720 \"\uc18c\uc18d\uc0ac \uc774\ub984, \ud574\ud53c\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\u2192\ub4dc\ub9bc\uce90\uccd0 \ucef4\ud37c\ub2c8\ub85c \ubcc0\uacbd\"|website=entertain.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2019-02-13}}</ref>\n\nAfter promotions of the new song 'PIRI', Dreamcatcher went on their Asia Tour 'Invitation from Nightmare City', which was announced to be held in several cities - Jakarta, Manila, Singapore, Seoul itself, as well as Japanese cities Tokyo and Kobe - from March to May 2019. However, due to undisclosed reasons, the concert stop in Jakarta was later canceled - instead, Dreamcatcher only stopped by in the city for a short fan-meeting.\n\nSubsequently, in July, 3 more stops were announced as part of the 'Invitation From Nightmare City' tour - Australian cities Melbourne and Sydney, together with Kuala Lumpur city in Malaysia. Concerts at these 3 locations took place from late August to early September. Unfortunately, due to a fire occurring at 170 Russell theater on August 31, Dreamcatcher was forced to cancel their Melbourne stop one day before the concert was to be held.\n\nOn August 31, Dreamcatcher announced the official 1st generation membership for their fanclub 'INSOMNIA', which will confer fans various benefits and limited edition goods. Both Korean and Japanese fanclub applications started on September 2, and lasted for a month.\n\nOn September 2, a series of pictures titled 'Mystery Code #01' were posted onto Instagram, possibly teasing a new release. The next day, a new 'Mystery Code #02' was posted onto their Instagram, containing 2 photos and a video. Following that, a comeback scheduler was unveiled - confirming the release of a new special mini album, ''Raid of Dream.''\n\nOn September 11, the group released their first Japanese full album titled ''The Beginning of The End'', which includes Japanese versions of most of their title songs and 2 new Japanese singles.

{"title_page": "Sexual bullying", "text_new": "'''Sexual bullying''' is a type of [[bullying]] and [[Sexual harassment|harassment]] that occurs in connection with a person's [[sex]], body,  [[sexual orientation]] or with [[sexual activity]]. It can be [[physical abuse|physical]], [[verbal abuse|verbal]], and/or [[emotional abuse|emotional]].\n\n==Definition==\nThe [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] has defined sexual bullying as \"any bullying behaviour, whether physical or non-physical, that is based on a person's sexuality or gender. It is when sexuality or gender is used as a weapon by boys or girls towards other boys or girls \u2013 although it is more commonly directed at girls. It can be carried out to a person's face, behind their back or through the use of technology.\"<ref name=NSPCC02 >{{cite web |url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/resourcesforteachers/classroomresources/sexual_bullying_definition_wdf68769.pdf |title=The NSPCC working definition of Sexual Bullying |publisher=[[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] |date= |accessdate=22 April 2010 }}</ref> The erstwhile [[Beatbullying]] organisation (now defunct) had a similar definition.<ref name=BB01 >{{cite web |url=http://www.bbclic.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=42&Itemid=56 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707214802/http://www.bbclic.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=42&Itemid=56 |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 July 2011 |title=What is sexual bullying?  |publisher=[[Beatbullying]] |accessdate=24 Apr 2010 }}</ref> It can be the use of sexual words to put someone down, like calling someone a [[slut]], a slag, or gay, or spreading rumours about someone's alleged [[sex life]]. In its most extreme form, it can be inappropriate touching, [[sexual assault]] or even [[rape]].<ref name=BB01 /> This term is primarily used in the United Kingdom and is not yet used in other areas.\nDefinitions and descriptions of bullying and of sexual bullying can be problematic, however. Offensive terms are often deployed in a friendly way, so the context of such exchanges is very important, and adults sometimes misinterpret them. Conversely, while much sexual bullying is overt, a great deal is not, and appears to be ordinary bullying. An example of this is the teasing by tough boys of a 'geeky' boy for his academic ability. What is actually happening is that the boy is being mocked for his lack of machismo, or his lack of engagement in heterosexist banter with girls or boys. Superficially, the bullying has no sexual content, but is underpinned by the aggressors staking a claim to dominance for their 'type of boy' (See Mac An Ghaill, 1994 and Duncan, 1999).\n\n==Prevalence==\nAs part of its research into sexual bullying in schools, the [[BBC]] [[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]] programme commissioned a\nquestionnaire aimed at young people aged 11\u201319 years in schools and youth clubs across five regions of [[England]].<ref name=BBC01 >{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_7811000/7811468.stm |title=Rising problem of sexual bullying in schools |publisher=[[BBC]] [[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]  |date= |accessdate=22 April 2010 }}</ref> The survey revealed that of the 273 young people who responded to the questionnaire, 28 had been forced to do something sexual and 31 had seen it happen to someone else.

The park was established in 1970 and was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] a year later.\n\nSettlers in the mid-19th century near the [[Verde River]] grew corn and other crops with the prospect of getting good prices from nearby [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], which was the territorial capital, and from nearby miners.  The rapid increase in population for the mining economy disrupted the hunting and gathering environments of the local [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes, the [[Dilzhe'e Apache]] and [[Yavapai-Apache Nation|Yavapai]]. In turn, they raided the farmers' crops for food.\n\nThe farmers requested military protection from the [[United States Army]] and, in 1865, although Arizona was still only a territory, the [[infantry]] arrived.  They set up several posts over the next few years:\n* 1865, a small camp five miles (8&nbsp;km) south of what is today Camp Verde.\n* 1866-1871, Camp Lincoln, a mile north of today's Fort Verde.\n* 1871-1873, Camp Verde, built gradually from 1871 to 1873.\n* 1879, Camp Verde, renamed Fort Verde\n* 1891, Fort Verde abandoned\n* 1899, sold at public auction\n\nAfter approximately 1,500 local natives were placed on a [[Indian reservation|reservation]] by 1872, the army's role changed from protecting the settlers to ensuring that the Indians stayed on the reservation. The last major military engagement with uprising natives took place in 1882 at the [[Battle of Big Dry Wash]].\n\nThe fort was never enclosed by walls or stockades, and it never saw fighting on site. At its height, it consisted of twenty-two buildings, only four of which survived until 1956, when local citizens created a small museum in the administration building. They later donated the buildings and ten acres (40,000 m\u00b2) as a State Park.\n\nSome of the buildings were built with [[pice]], which is large [[adobe]] slabs cast within wooden frames, rather than assembled from the more familiar individual adobe bricks.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Historic structures in Fort Verde State Historic Park==\nThe following structures and markers are pictured:\n*The '''\"0\" Mile General Crook Trail Marker''' which is located in the place where in 1871 General George Crook established a military supply trail which connected Forts Whipple, Verde and Apache. The marker is located close to the Fort Verde '''Administration Building'''.\n*The main '''Administration Building'''.

The park was established in 1970 and was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] a year later.\n\nSettlers in the mid-19th century near the [[Verde River]] grew corn and other crops with the prospect of getting good prices from nearby [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], which was the territorial capital, and from nearby miners.  The rapid increase in population for the mining economy disrupted the hunting and gathering environments of the local [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes, the [[Dilzhe'e Apache]] and [[Yavapai-Apache Nation|Yavapai]]. In turn, they raided the farmers' crops for food.\n\nThe farmers requested military protection from the [[United States Army]] and, in 1865, although Arizona was still only a territory, the [[infantry]] arrived.  They set up several posts over the next few years:\n* 1865, a small camp five miles (8&nbsp;km) south of what is today Camp Verde.\n* 1866-1871, Camp Lincoln, a mile north of today's Fort Verde.\n* 1871-1873, Camp Verde, built gradually from 1871 to 1873.\n* 1879, Camp Verde, renamed Fort Verde\n* 1891, Fort Verde abandoned\n* 1899, sold at public auction\n\nAfter approximately 1,500 local natives were placed on a [[Indian reservation|reservation]] by 1872, the army's role changed from protecting the settlers to ensuring that the Indians stayed on the reservation. The last major military engagement with uprising natives took place in 1882 at the [[Battle of Big Dry Wash]].\n\nThe fort was never enclosed by walls or stockades, and it never saw fighting on site. At its height, it consisted of twenty-two buildings, only four of which survived until 1956, when local citizens created a small museum in the administration building. They later donated the buildings and ten acres (40,000 m\u00b2) as a State Park.\n\nSome of the buildings were built with [[pice]], which is large [[adobe]] slabs cast within wooden frames, rather than assembled from the more familiar individual adobe bricks.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Historic structures in Fort Verde State Historic Park==\nThe following structures and markers are pictured:\n*The '''\"0\" Mile General Crook Trail Marker''' which is located in the place where in 1871 General George Crook established a military supply trail which connected Forts Whipple, Verde and Apache.
