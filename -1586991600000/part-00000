As early as 1930 the city's Planning Board recommended a raised express highway running north\u2013south through the [[Downtown Boston|downtown]] district in order to draw traffic off the city streets.<ref>Daily Boston Globe, December 21, 1930 'Streets In The Air Only Solution To Boston's Traffic Problems So Says the Planning Board That Asks for Two-Level Road Across City, Costing $28,000,000, as First Item in a Big Scheme'</ref> Commissioner of Public Works [[William F.

Governor [[John Volpe]] interceded in the 1950s to change the design of the last section of the Central Artery putting it underground through the [[Dewey Square Tunnel]]. While traffic moved somewhat better, the other problems remained. There was chronic congestion on the Central Artery (I-93), an elevated six-lane highway through the center of downtown Boston, which was, in the words of Pete Sigmund, \"like a funnel full of slowly-moving, or stopped, cars (and swearing motorists).\"<ref name=autogenerated3>{{Cite news |first=Pete |last=Sigmund |url=http://cegltd.com/story.asp?story=8751&headline=Triumph,%20Tragedy%20Mark%20Boston%E2%80%99s%20Big%20Dig%20Project |title=Triumph, Tragedy Mark Boston's Big Dig Project |publisher=Construction Equipment Guide |date=June 6, 2007 |accessdate=December 10, 2007 |df= }}</ref>\nIn 1959, the 1.5-mile-long (2.4&nbsp;km) road section carried approximately 75,000 vehicles a day, but by the 1990s, this had grown to 190,000 vehicles a day.

Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge|Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge]] over the Charles River under construction, looking north. The old elevated Central Artery crossing is to the right.]]\nAnother important motivation for the final form of the Big Dig was the abandonment of the Massachusetts Department of Public Works' intended expressway system through and around Boston. The Central Artery, as part of Mass. DPW's Master Plan of 1948, was originally planned to be the downtown Boston stretch of [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]], and was signed as such; a bypass road called the Inner Belt, was subsequently renamed [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 695]]. (The law establishing the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956|Interstate highway system]] was enacted in 1956.) The [[Inner Belt District]] was to pass to the west of the downtown core, through the neighborhood of [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] and the cities of [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], and [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]]. Earlier controversies over impact of the Boston extension of the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], particularly on the heavily populated neighborhood of [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]], and the additional large amount of housing that would have had to be destroyed led to [[freeway and expressway revolts|massive community opposition]] to both the Inner Belt and the Boston section of I-95.<ref>{{cite web |title=Boston's Cancelled Highways |url=http://www.bostonstreetcars.com/bostons-cancelled-highways.html |website=Boston Streetcars |accessdate=January 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBuilding demolition and land clearances for I-95 through the neighborhoods of Roxbury, [[Jamaica Plain]], and [[Roslindale]] led to secession threats by [[Hyde Park, Boston|Hyde Park]], Boston's youngest and southernmost neighborhood. By 1972, with only a minimum of work done on the I-95 right of way and none on the potentially massively disruptive Inner Belt, Governor [[Francis Sargent]] put a moratorium on highway construction within the [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route&nbsp;128]] corridor, except for the final short stretch of Interstate 93. In 1974, the remainder of the Master Plan was canceled, leaving Boston with a severely overstressed expressway system for the existing traffic.\n\nWith ever-increasing traffic volumes funneled onto I-93 alone, the Central Artery became chronically gridlocked. The Sargent moratorium led to the rerouting of I-95 away from Boston around the Route&nbsp;128 beltway and the conversion of the cleared land in the southern part of the city into the [[Southwest Corridor Park|Southwest Corridor linear park]], as well as a new right-of-way for the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] subway and [[Amtrak]].<ref>{{cite web |title=\"Decisions Touching the Lives of All of Us\": The Plan That Changed Boston Forever |url=http://transitcenter.org/2016/06/22/massachusetts-governor-decides-transit-good-highways-bad/ |website=TransitCenter |accessdate=January 28, 2019|date=June 23, 2016 }}</ref> Parts of the planned I-695 right-of-way remain unused and under consideration for future mass-transit projects.\n\nThe original 1948 Master Plan included a Third Harbor Tunnel plan that was hugely controversial in its own right, because it would have disrupted the [[Maverick Square]] area of [[East Boston]]. It was never built.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Federal Highway Administration |author2=Massachusetts Department of Public Works |title=Third harbor tunnel, interstate 90/central artery, interstate 93: full environmental impact statement and final section 4(f) evaluation |date=August 1985 |url=https://archive.org/stream/thirdharbortunne01mass/thirdharbortunne01mass_djvu.txt}}</ref>\n\n===Mixing of traffic===\nA major reason for the all-day congestion was that the Central Artery carried not only north\u2013south traffic, but it also carried east\u2013west traffic. Boston's Logan Airport lies across [[Boston Harbor]] in East Boston; and before the Big Dig, the only access to the airport from downtown was through the paired [[Callahan Tunnel|Callahan]] and [[Sumner Tunnel|Sumner]] tunnels. Traffic on the major highways from west of Boston\u2014the Massachusetts Turnpike and [[Storrow Drive]]\u2014mostly traveled on portions of the Central Artery to reach these tunnels. Getting between the Central Artery and the tunnels involved short diversions onto city streets, increasing local congestion.\n\n===Mass transit===\nA number of [[public transportation]] projects were included as part of an [[environmental mitigation]] for the Big Dig. The most expensive was the building of the Phase II [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] tunnel under [[Fort Point Channel]], done in coordination with Big Dig construction. Silver Line buses now use this tunnel and the Ted Williams Tunnel to link [[South Station]] and Logan Airport.\n\n{{As of|2020}}, promised projects to extend the Green Line beyond [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere]], to connect the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red]] and [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue]] subway lines, and to restore the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]] streetcar service to the [[Forest Hills (MBTA station)|Arborway]] in [[Jamaica Plain]] have not been completed.

Negotiations with the federal government had led to an agreement to widen some of the lanes in the new harbor tunnel, and accommodating these would require the tunnel to be deeper and mechanically-vented; this left no room for the rail lines, and having diesel trains (then in use) passing through the tunnel would have substantially increased the cost of the ventilation system.<ref name=\"Haglund2003\">{{cite book|last1=Haglund|first1=Charles|title=Inventing the Charles River|date=2003|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0262083078|page=[https://archive.org/details/inventingcharles00hagl/page/316 316]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/inventingcharles00hagl/page/316}}</ref>\n\n==Early planning==\nThe project was conceived in the 1970s by the [[Boston Transportation Planning Review]] to replace the rusting elevated six-lane Central Artery. The expressway separated downtown from the waterfront, and was increasingly choked with bumper-to-bumper traffic. Business leaders were more concerned about access to [[Logan Airport]], and pushed instead for a third harbor tunnel. In their second terms, [[Michael Dukakis]] (governor) and [[Fred Salvucci]] (secretary of transportation) came up with the strategy of tying the two projects together\u2014thereby combining the project that the business community supported with the project that they and the City of Boston supported.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nPlanning for the Big Dig as a project officially began in 1982, with environmental impact studies starting in 1983. After years of extensive lobbying for federal dollars, a 1987 public works bill appropriating funding for the Big Dig was passed by the [[Congress of the United States|US Congress]], but it was vetoed by President [[Ronald Reagan]] for being too expensive. When Congress [[Veto override|overrode]] the veto, the project had its green light and ground was first broken in 1991.<ref>Dan McNichol and Andy Ryan, ''The Big Dig''.

Eventually, MTA combined some of its employees with joint venture employees in an integrated project organization. This was intended to make management more efficient, but it hindered MTA's ability to independently oversee project activities because MTA and the joint venture had effectively become partners in the project.<ref>OIG Testimony CC-2005-027, \"Impact of Water Leaks on the Central Artery/Tunnel Project and Remaining Risks\"</ref>\n\n==Obstacles==\nIn addition to political and financial difficulties, the project faced several environmental and engineering obstacles.\nThe downtown area through which the tunnels were to be dug was largely [[Land reclamation|land fill]], and included existing [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] and [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue Line]] [[rapid transit|subway]] tunnels as well as innumerable pipes and utility lines that would have to be replaced or moved. Tunnel workers encountered many unexpected geological and archaeological barriers, ranging from glacial debris to foundations of buried houses and a number of sunken ships lying within the reclaimed land.\n\nThe project received approval from state environmental agencies in 1991, after satisfying concerns including release of toxins by the excavation and the possibility of disrupting the homes of millions of [[rat]]s, causing them to roam the streets of Boston in search of new housing.

Because the old elevated highway (which remained in operation throughout the construction process) rested on pylons located throughout the designated dig area, engineers first utilized [[slurry wall]] techniques to create {{convert|120|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} concrete walls upon which the highway could rest. These concrete walls also stabilized the sides of the site, preventing cave-ins during the continued excavation process.\n\nThe multi-lane Interstate highway also had to pass under [[South Station (MBTA)|South Station]]'s seven railway tracks, which carried over 40,000 commuters and 400 trains per day. To avoid multiple relocations of train lines while the tunneling advanced, as had been initially planned, a specially designed [[jack (device)|jack]] was constructed to support the ground and tracks to allow the excavation to take place below. Construction crews also used [[ground freezing]] (an artificial induction of [[permafrost]]) to help stabilize surrounding ground as they excavated the tunnel. This was the largest tunneling project undertaken beneath railway lines anywhere in the world. The ground freezing enabled safer, more efficient [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavation]], and also assisted in environmental issues, as less contaminated fill needed to be exported than if a traditional [[Cut-and-cover tunnel|cut-and-cover method]] had been applied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tunnels.mottmac.com/projects/?mode=region&amp;id=3418 |title=Boston Central Artery Jacked Tunnels - Mott MacDonald Project Page |publisher=Tunnels.mottmac.com |accessdate=April 8, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408221143/https://tunnels.mottmac.com/projects/?mode=region&amp;id=3418 |archivedate=April 8, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nOther challenges included existing subway tunnels crossing the path of the underground highway. To build slurry walls past these tunnels, it was necessary to dig beneath the tunnels and to build an underground concrete bridge to support the tunnels' weight, without interrupting rail service.\n\n==Construction phase==\n[[Image:Boston-big-dig-area.png|thumb|Construction sites of the \"Big Dig\"]]\n\nThe project was managed by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, with the Big Dig and the Turnpike's Boston Extension from the 1960s being financially and legally joined by the legislature as the [[Metropolitan Highway System]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/81a-3.htm |title=MGL Chapter 81A, Section 3 |publisher=Mass.gov |accessdate=April 8, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726222848/http://www.mass.gov//legis/laws/mgl/81a-3.htm |archivedate=July 26, 2010 }}</ref> Design and construction was supervised by a joint venture of [[Bechtel Corporation]] and [[Parsons Brinckerhoff]]. Because of the enormous size of the project\u2014too large for any company to undertake alone\u2014the design and construction of the Big Dig was broken up into dozens of smaller subprojects with well-defined interfaces between contractors. Major heavy-construction contractors on the project included [[Jay Cashman]], [[Modern Continental]], [[Obayashi Corporation]], [[Perini Building Company|Perini Corporation]], [[Peter Kiewit Sons' Incorporated]], [[J.

Many environmental advocates preferred a river crossing entirely in tunnels, but this, along with 27 other plans, was rejected as too costly. Finally, with a deadline looming to begin construction on a separate project that would connect the [[Tobin Bridge]] to the Charles River crossing, Salvucci overrode the objections and chose a variant of the plan known as \"Scheme Z\".

Zakim Bridge]]\nSwiss engineer [[Christian Menn]] took over the design of the bridge. He suggested a cradle [[cable-stayed bridge]] that would carry ten lanes of traffic. The plan was accepted and construction began on the [[Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge]]. The bridge employed an asymmetrical design and a hybrid of steel and concrete was used to construct it. The distinctive bridge is supported by two forked towers connected to the span by cables and girders. It was the first bridge in the country to employ this method and it was, at the time, the widest cable-stayed bridge in the world,<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite news | first=Pete | last=Sigmund | url=http://www.cegltd.com/story.asp?story=8751&headline=Triumph,%20Tragedy%20Mark%20Boston%E2%80%99s%20Big%20Dig%20Project | title=Triumph, Tragedy Mark Boston's Big Dig Project | publisher=Construction Equipment Guide | date=June 6, 2007 | accessdate=December 10, 2007 | df= }}</ref> having since been surpassed by the [[Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge]], although that structure is actually a self-anchored suspension bridge, not a cable-stayed bridge.\n\nMeanwhile, construction continued on the Tobin Bridge approach. By the time all parties agreed on the I-93 design, construction of the Tobin connector (today known as the \"City Square Tunnel\" for a [[Charlestown, Boston, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] area it bypasses) was far along, significantly adding to the cost of constructing the [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|US Route 1]] interchange and retrofitting the tunnel. <!--Shift to active voice shortened this sentence a little, but it's still unclear whether the Rt1 work and tunnel retrofit were built, or were abandoned because of the increased cost.-->\n\nBoston blue [[clay]] and other soils extracted from the path of the tunnel were used to cap many local [[landfill]]s, fill in the [[Quincy Quarries Reservation|Granite Rail Quarry]] in [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]], and restore the surface of [[Spectacle Island (Massachusetts)|Spectacle Island]] in the [[Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area]].\n\nThe [[Storrow Drive Connector]], a companion bridge to the Zakim, began carrying traffic from I-93 to [[Storrow Drive]] in 1999. The project had been under consideration for years, but was opposed by the wealthy residents of the [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]] neighborhood. However, it finally was accepted because it would funnel traffic bound for Storrow Drive and downtown Boston away from the mainline roadway.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bostonroads.com/crossings/zakim/ | title=Leonard P.

Eventual [[cost overruns]] were so high that the chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, [[James Kerasiotes]], was fired in 2000. His replacement had to commit to an $8.55 billion cap on federal contributions. The total expenses eventually passed $15 billion. Interest brought this cost to $21.93 billion.\n\n===Engineering methods and details===\n[[Image:BigDigSupportsCentralArtery.agr.jpg|thumb|left|Temporary supports hold up elevated Central Artery during construction.]]\nSeveral unusual engineering challenges arose during the project, requiring unusual solutions and methods to address them.\n\nAt the beginning of the project, engineers had to figure out the safest way to build the tunnel without endangering the existing elevated highway above. Eventually, they created horizontal braces as wide as the tunnel, then cut away the elevated highway's struts, and lowered it onto the new braces.<ref name=\"AP 122507\">{{Cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071225/ap_on_re_us/big_dig_the_end |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228035119/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071225/ap_on_re_us/big_dig_the_end |archivedate=December 28, 2007 |title=Boston's $14.8B Big Dig finally complete |first=Steve |last=LeBlanc |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=December 25, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Final phases==\n[[Image:Tunnel-large.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Interstate 93 Tunnel]]\n\nOn January 18, 2003, the opening ceremony was held for the I-90 Connector Tunnel, extending the Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90) east into the [[Ted Williams Tunnel]], and onwards to Boston [[Logan International Airport]]. The Ted Williams tunnel had been completed and was in limited use for commercial traffic and [[high-occupancy vehicle]]s since late 1995. The westbound lanes opened on the afternoon of January 18 and the eastbound lanes on January 19.\n\nThe next phase, moving the elevated Interstate 93 underground, was completed in two stages: northbound lanes opened in March 2003 and southbound lanes (in a temporary configuration) on December 20, 2003. A tunnel underneath [[Leverett Circle]] connecting eastbound Storrow Drive to I-93 North and the Tobin Bridge opened December 19, 2004, easing congestion at the circle. All southbound lanes of I-93 opened to traffic on March 5, 2005, including the left lane of the Zakim Bridge, and all of the refurbished [[Dewey Square Tunnel]].\n\nBy the end of December 2004, 95% of the Big Dig was completed. Major construction remained on the surface, including construction of final ramp configurations in the [[North End, Boston, Massachusetts|North End]] and in the [[South Bay, Boston, Massachusetts|South Bay]] interchange, and reconstruction of the surface streets.\n\nThe final ramp downtown\u2014exit 20B from [[Interstate 93|I-93]] south to [[Albany Street (Boston)|Albany Street]]\u2014opened January 13, 2006.<ref>{{cite news | first=Casey | last=Ross | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/969503741.html?dids=969503741:969503741&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jan+14%2C+2006&author=CASEY+ROSS&pub=Boston+Herald&edition=&startpage=009&desc=Hallelujah+Hub+drivers!+Last+Big+Dig+ramp+done | title=Hallelujah Hub drivers!

The intent of the program was to integrate public art into highway infrastructure (retaining walls, fences, and lighting) and the essential elements of the pedestrian environment (walkways, park landscape elements, and bridges). As overall project costs increased, the Artery Arts Program was seen as a potential liability, even though there was support and interest from the public and professional arts organizations in the area.\n\nAt the beginning of the highway design process, a temporary arts program was initiated, and over 50 proposals were selected. However, development began on only a few projects before funding for the program was cut. Permanent public art that was funded includes: super graphic text and facades of former [[West End, Boston|West End]] houses cast into the concrete elevated highway abutment support walls near [[North Station]] by artist [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]]; Harbor Fog, a sensor-activated mist, light and sound sculptural environment by artist [[Ross Miller (artist)|Ross Miller]] in parcel 17; a historical sculpture celebrating the 18th and 19th century shipbuilding industry and a bust of shipbuilder [[Donald McKay]] in [[East Boston]]; blue interior lighting of the Zakim Bridge; and the [[Millers River (Middlesex)|Miller's River]] Littoral Way walkway and lighting under the loop ramps north of the [[Charles River]].\n\nExtensive landscape planting, as well as a maintenance program to support the plantings, was requested by many community members during public meetings. <!-- need more details on landscape program here -->\n\n==Impact on traffic==\n[[Image:ONeilltoZakimBridge.agr.jpg|thumb|Traffic exiting the Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel onto the Zakim Bridge.]]\nThe Big Dig untangled the co-mingled traffic from the Massachusetts Turnpike and the Sumner and Callahan tunnels. While only one net lane in each direction was added to the north\u2013south I-93, several new east\u2013west lanes became available. East\u2013west traffic on the Massachusetts Turnpike/I-90 now proceeds directly through the Ted Williams Tunnel to Logan Airport and Route 1A beyond. Traffic between Storrow Drive and the Callahan and Sumner Tunnels still uses a short portion of I-93, but additional lanes and direct connections are provided for this traffic.\n\nThe result was a 62% reduction in vehicle hours of travel on I-93, the airport tunnels, and the connection from Storrow Drive, from an average 38,200 hours per day before construction (1994\u20131995) to 14,800 hours per day in 2004\u20132005, after the project was largely complete.<ref name=impactreport>{{cite web |url= http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |title= Archived copy |accessdate=November 4, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110108043647/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |archivedate= January 8, 2011 }} Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, Table 3-6: {{cite web |url= http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |title= Archived copy |accessdate=November 4, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110108043647/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |archivedate= January 8, 2011 }}</ref> The savings for travelers was estimated at $166 million annually in the same 2004\u20132005 time frame.<ref>[http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, p. 24] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108043647/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |date=January 8, 2011 }}</ref> Travel times on the Central Artery northbound during the afternoon peak hour were reduced 85.6%.<ref>[http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, Table 3-1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108043647/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |date=January 8, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nA 2008 ''Boston Globe'' report asserted that waiting time for the majority of trips actually increased as a result of [[induced demand|demand induced]] by the increased road capacity.

This also forced the Turnpike Authority to release information regarding its non-disclosure of prior leaks. A follow-up reported on \"extensive\" leaks that were more severe than state authorities had previously acknowledged. The report went on to state that the $14.6 billion tunnel system was riddled with more than 400 leaks. A ''[[Boston Globe]]'' report, however, countered that by stating there were nearly 700 leaks in a single {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} section of tunnel beneath [[South Station]]. Turnpike officials also stated that the number of leaks being investigated was down from 1,000 to 500.<ref name=\"evenmorebigleaks\" />\n\nThe problem of leaks is further aggravated by the fact that many of them involve corrosive [[Seawater|salt water]]. This is caused by the proximity of [[Boston Harbor]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]], causing a mix of salt and fresh water leaks in the tunnel. The situation is made worse by [[road salt]] spread in the tunnel to melt ice during freezing weather, or brought in by vehicles passing through.<ref name=\"54m-fix\"/> Salt water and [[salt spray]] are well-known issues that must be dealt with in any [[marine environment]].

While traffic moved somewhat better, the other problems remained. There was chronic congestion on the Central Artery (I-93), an elevated six-lane highway through the center of downtown Boston, which was, in the words of Pete Sigmund, \"like a funnel full of slowly-moving, or stopped, cars (and swearing motorists).\"<ref name=autogenerated3>{{Cite news |first=Pete |last=Sigmund |url=http://cegltd.com/story.asp?story=8751&headline=Triumph,%20Tragedy%20Mark%20Boston%E2%80%99s%20Big%20Dig%20Project |title=Triumph, Tragedy Mark Boston's Big Dig Project |publisher=Construction Equipment Guide |date=2007-06-06 |accessdate=2007-12-10 |df= }}</ref>\nIn 1959, the 1.5-mile-long (2.4&nbsp;km) road section carried approximately 75,000 vehicles a day, but by the 1990s, this had grown to 190,000 vehicles a day.

Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge|Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge]] over the Charles River under construction, looking north. The old elevated Central Artery crossing is to the right.]]\nAnother important motivation for the final form of the Big Dig was the abandonment of the Massachusetts Department of Public Works' intended expressway system through and around Boston. The Central Artery, as part of Mass. DPW's Master Plan of 1948, was originally planned to be the downtown Boston stretch of [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]], and was signed as such; a bypass road called the Inner Belt, was subsequently renamed [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 695]]. (The law establishing the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956|Interstate highway system]] was enacted in 1956.) The [[Inner Belt District]] was to pass to the west of the downtown core, through the neighborhood of [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] and the cities of [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], and [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]]. Earlier controversies over impact of the Boston extension of the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], particularly on the heavily populated neighborhood of [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]], and the additional large amount of housing that would have had to be destroyed led to [[freeway and expressway revolts|massive community opposition]] to both the Inner Belt and the Boston section of I-95.<ref>{{cite web |title=Boston's Cancelled Highways |url=http://www.bostonstreetcars.com/bostons-cancelled-highways.html |website=Boston Streetcars |accessdate=January 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBuilding demolition and land clearances for I-95 through the neighborhoods of Roxbury, [[Jamaica Plain]], and [[Roslindale]] led to secession threats by [[Hyde Park, Boston|Hyde Park]], Boston's youngest and southernmost neighborhood. By 1972, with only a minimum of work done on the I-95 right of way and none on the potentially massively disruptive Inner Belt, Governor [[Francis Sargent]] put a moratorium on highway construction within the [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route&nbsp;128]] corridor, except for the final short stretch of Interstate 93. In 1974, the remainder of the Master Plan was canceled, leaving Boston with a severely overstressed expressway system for the existing traffic.\n\nWith ever-increasing traffic volumes funneled onto I-93 alone, the Central Artery became chronically gridlocked. The Sargent moratorium led to the rerouting of I-95 away from Boston around the Route&nbsp;128 beltway and the conversion of the cleared land in the southern part of the city into the [[Southwest Corridor Park|Southwest Corridor linear park]], as well as a new right-of-way for the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] subway and [[Amtrak]].<ref>{{cite web |title=\"Decisions Touching the Lives of All of Us\": The Plan That Changed Boston Forever |url=http://transitcenter.org/2016/06/22/massachusetts-governor-decides-transit-good-highways-bad/ |website=TransitCenter |accessdate=January 28, 2019|date=2016-06-23 }}</ref> Parts of the planned I-695 right-of-way remain unused and under consideration for future mass-transit projects.\n\nThe original 1948 Master Plan included a Third Harbor Tunnel plan that was hugely controversial in its own right, because it would have disrupted the [[Maverick Square]] area of [[East Boston]].

Boston's Logan Airport lies across [[Boston Harbor]] in East Boston; and before the Big Dig, the only access to the airport from downtown was through the paired [[Callahan Tunnel|Callahan]] and [[Sumner Tunnel|Sumner]] tunnels. Traffic on the major highways from west of Boston\u2014the Massachusetts Turnpike and [[Storrow Drive]]\u2014mostly traveled on portions of the Central Artery to reach these tunnels. Getting between the Central Artery and the tunnels involved short diversions onto city streets, increasing local congestion.\n\n===Mass transit===\nA number of [[public transportation]] projects were included as part of an [[environmental mitigation]] for the Big Dig. The most expensive was the building of the Phase II [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] tunnel under [[Fort Point Channel]], done in coordination with Big Dig construction. Silver Line buses now use this tunnel and the Ted Williams Tunnel to link [[South Station]] and Logan Airport.\n\n{{As of|2020}}, promised projects to extend the Green Line beyond [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere]], to connect the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red]] and [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue]] subway lines, and to restore the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]] streetcar service to the [[Forest Hills (MBTA station)|Arborway]] in [[Jamaica Plain]] have not been completed.

Negotiations with the federal government had led to an agreement to widen some of the lanes in the new harbor tunnel, and accommodating these would require the tunnel to be deeper and mechanically-vented; this left no room for the rail lines, and having diesel trains (then in use) passing through the tunnel would have substantially increased the cost of the ventilation system.<ref name=\"Haglund2003\">{{cite book|last1=Haglund|first1=Charles|title=Inventing the Charles River|date=2003|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0262083078|page=[https://archive.org/details/inventingcharles00hagl/page/316 316]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/inventingcharles00hagl/page/316}}</ref>\n\n==Early planning==\nThe project was conceived in the 1970s by the [[Boston Transportation Planning Review]] to replace the rusting elevated six-lane Central Artery. The expressway separated downtown from the waterfront, and was increasingly choked with bumper-to-bumper traffic. Business leaders were more concerned about access to [[Logan Airport]], and pushed instead for a third harbor tunnel. In their second terms, [[Michael Dukakis]] (governor) and [[Fred Salvucci]] (secretary of transportation) came up with the strategy of tying the two projects together\u2014thereby combining the project that the business community supported with the project that they and the City of Boston supported.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nPlanning for the Big Dig as a project officially began in 1982, with environmental impact studies starting in 1983. After years of extensive lobbying for federal dollars, a 1987 public works bill appropriating funding for the Big Dig was passed by the [[Congress of the United States|US Congress]], but it was vetoed by President [[Ronald Reagan]] for being too expensive. When Congress [[Veto override|overrode]] the veto, the project had its green light and ground was first broken in 1991.<ref>Dan McNichol and Andy Ryan, ''The Big Dig''.

Eventually, MTA combined some of its employees with joint venture employees in an integrated project organization. This was intended to make management more efficient, but it hindered MTA's ability to independently oversee project activities because MTA and the joint venture had effectively become partners in the project.<ref>OIG Testimony CC-2005-027, \"Impact of Water Leaks on the Central Artery/Tunnel Project and Remaining Risks\"</ref>\n\n==Obstacles==\nIn addition to political and financial difficulties, the project faced several environmental and engineering obstacles.\nThe downtown area through which the tunnels were to be dug was largely [[Land reclamation|land fill]], and included existing [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] and [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue Line]] [[rapid transit|subway]] tunnels as well as innumerable pipes and utility lines that would have to be replaced or moved. Tunnel workers encountered many unexpected geological and archaeological barriers, ranging from glacial debris to foundations of buried houses and a number of sunken ships lying within the reclaimed land.\n\nThe project received approval from state environmental agencies in 1991, after satisfying concerns including release of toxins by the excavation and the possibility of disrupting the homes of millions of [[rat]]s, causing them to roam the streets of Boston in search of new housing.

Because the old elevated highway (which remained in operation throughout the construction process) rested on pylons located throughout the designated dig area, engineers first utilized [[slurry wall]] techniques to create {{convert|120|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} concrete walls upon which the highway could rest. These concrete walls also stabilized the sides of the site, preventing cave-ins during the continued excavation process.\n\nThe multi-lane Interstate highway also had to pass under [[South Station (MBTA)|South Station]]'s seven railway tracks, which carried over 40,000 commuters and 400 trains per day. To avoid multiple relocations of train lines while the tunneling advanced, as had been initially planned, a specially designed [[jack (device)|jack]] was constructed to support the ground and tracks to allow the excavation to take place below. Construction crews also used [[ground freezing]] (an artificial induction of [[permafrost]]) to help stabilize surrounding ground as they excavated the tunnel. This was the largest tunneling project undertaken beneath railway lines anywhere in the world. The ground freezing enabled safer, more efficient [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavation]], and also assisted in environmental issues, as less contaminated fill needed to be exported than if a traditional [[Cut-and-cover tunnel|cut-and-cover method]] had been applied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tunnels.mottmac.com/projects/?mode=region&amp;id=3418 |title=Boston Central Artery Jacked Tunnels - Mott MacDonald Project Page |publisher=Tunnels.mottmac.com |accessdate=2014-04-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408221143/https://tunnels.mottmac.com/projects/?mode=region&amp;id=3418 |archivedate=2014-04-08 }}</ref>\n\nOther challenges included existing subway tunnels crossing the path of the underground highway. To build slurry walls past these tunnels, it was necessary to dig beneath the tunnels and to build an underground concrete bridge to support the tunnels' weight, without interrupting rail service.\n\n==Construction phase==\n[[Image:Boston-big-dig-area.png|thumb|Construction sites of the \"Big Dig\"]]\n\nThe project was managed by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, with the Big Dig and the Turnpike's Boston Extension from the 1960s being financially and legally joined by the legislature as the [[Metropolitan Highway System]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/81a-3.htm |title=MGL Chapter 81A, Section 3 |publisher=Mass.gov |accessdate=2014-04-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726222848/http://www.mass.gov//legis/laws/mgl/81a-3.htm |archivedate=2010-07-26 }}</ref> Design and construction was supervised by a joint venture of [[Bechtel Corporation]] and [[Parsons Brinckerhoff]]. Because of the enormous size of the project\u2014too large for any company to undertake alone\u2014the design and construction of the Big Dig was broken up into dozens of smaller subprojects with well-defined interfaces between contractors. Major heavy-construction contractors on the project included [[Jay Cashman]], [[Modern Continental]], [[Obayashi Corporation]], [[Perini Building Company|Perini Corporation]], [[Peter Kiewit Sons' Incorporated]], [[J.

Many environmental advocates preferred a river crossing entirely in tunnels, but this, along with 27 other plans, was rejected as too costly. Finally, with a deadline looming to begin construction on a separate project that would connect the [[Tobin Bridge]] to the Charles River crossing, Salvucci overrode the objections and chose a variant of the plan known as \"Scheme Z\". This plan was considered to be reasonably cost-effective, but had the drawback of requiring highway ramps stacked up as high as {{convert|100|ft|m}} immediately adjacent to the Charles River.<ref name=\"bg-scheme z\">{{Cite news|title=Caution: High bridge ahead; Artery plan includes an awful scheme for a great wall across the Charles |last=Campbell |first=Robert |date=June 24, 1990 |work= Boston Globe |id= Accessed 2009-08-04 |quote= The grotesque monstrosity that will be the new Central Artery requires a certain power of imagination to be grasped.

The plan was accepted and construction began on the [[Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge]]. The bridge employed an asymmetrical design and a hybrid of steel and concrete was used to construct it. The distinctive bridge is supported by two forked towers connected to the span by cables and girders.

By the time all parties agreed on the I-93 design, construction of the Tobin connector (today known as the \"City Square Tunnel\" for a [[Charlestown, Boston, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] area it bypasses) was far along, significantly adding to the cost of constructing the [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|US Route 1]] interchange and retrofitting the tunnel. <!--Shift to active voice shortened this sentence a little, but it's still unclear whether the Rt1 work and tunnel retrofit were built, or were abandoned because of the increased cost.-->\n\nBoston blue [[clay]] and other soils extracted from the path of the tunnel were used to cap many local [[landfill]]s, fill in the [[Quincy Quarries Reservation|Granite Rail Quarry]] in [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]], and restore the surface of [[Spectacle Island (Massachusetts)|Spectacle Island]] in the [[Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area]].\n\nThe [[Storrow Drive Connector]], a companion bridge to the Zakim, began carrying traffic from I-93 to [[Storrow Drive]] in 1999.

The intent of the program was to integrate public art into highway infrastructure (retaining walls, fences, and lighting) and the essential elements of the pedestrian environment (walkways, park landscape elements, and bridges). As overall project costs increased, the Artery Arts Program was seen as a potential liability, even though there was support and interest from the public and professional arts organizations in the area.\n\nAt the beginning of the highway design process, a temporary arts program was initiated, and over 50 proposals were selected. However, development began on only a few projects before funding for the program was cut. Permanent public art that was funded includes: super graphic text and facades of former [[West End, Boston|West End]] houses cast into the concrete elevated highway abutment support walls near [[North Station]] by artist [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]]; Harbor Fog, a sensor-activated mist, light and sound sculptural environment by artist [[Ross Miller (artist)|Ross Miller]] in parcel 17; a historical sculpture celebrating the 18th and 19th century shipbuilding industry and a bust of shipbuilder [[Donald McKay]] in [[East Boston]]; blue interior lighting of the Zakim Bridge; and the [[Millers River (Middlesex)|Miller's River]] Littoral Way walkway and lighting under the loop ramps north of the [[Charles River]].\n\nExtensive landscape planting, as well as a maintenance program to support the plantings, was requested by many community members during public meetings. <!-- need more details on landscape program here -->\n\n==Impact on traffic==\n[[Image:ONeilltoZakimBridge.agr.jpg|thumb|Traffic exiting the Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel onto the Zakim Bridge.]]\nThe Big Dig untangled the co-mingled traffic from the Massachusetts Turnpike and the Sumner and Callahan tunnels. While only one net lane in each direction was added to the north\u2013south I-93, several new east\u2013west lanes became available. East\u2013west traffic on the Massachusetts Turnpike/I-90 now proceeds directly through the Ted Williams Tunnel to Logan Airport and Route 1A beyond. Traffic between Storrow Drive and the Callahan and Sumner Tunnels still uses a short portion of I-93, but additional lanes and direct connections are provided for this traffic.\n\nThe result was a 62% reduction in vehicle hours of travel on I-93, the airport tunnels, and the connection from Storrow Drive, from an average 38,200 hours per day before construction (1994\u20131995) to 14,800 hours per day in 2004\u20132005, after the project was largely complete.<ref name=impactreport>{{cite web |url= http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |title= Archived copy |accessdate=November 4, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110108043647/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |archivedate= January 8, 2011 }} Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, Table 3-6: {{cite web |url= http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |title= Archived copy |accessdate=November 4, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110108043647/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |archivedate= January 8, 2011 }}</ref> The savings for travelers was estimated at $166 million annually in the same 2004\u20132005 time frame.<ref>[http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, p. 24] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108043647/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |date=January 8, 2011 }}</ref> Travel times on the Central Artery northbound during the afternoon peak hour were reduced 85.6%.<ref>[http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, Table 3-1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108043647/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |date=January 8, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nA 2008 ''Boston Globe'' report asserted that waiting time for the majority of trips actually increased as a result of [[induced demand|demand induced]] by the increased road capacity.

The report states, \"Ultimately, many motorists going to and from the suburbs at peak rush hours are spending more time stuck in traffic, not less.\" The ''Globe'' also asserted that their analysis provides a fuller picture of the traffic situation than a state-commissioned study done two years earlier, in which the Big Dig was credited with helping to save at least $167 million a year by increasing economic productivity and decreasing motor vehicle operating costs.

This also forced the Turnpike Authority to release information regarding its non-disclosure of prior leaks. A follow-up reported on \"extensive\" leaks that were more severe than state authorities had previously acknowledged. The report went on to state that the $14.6 billion tunnel system was riddled with more than 400 leaks. A ''[[Boston Globe]]'' report, however, countered that by stating there were nearly 700 leaks in a single {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} section of tunnel beneath [[South Station]]. Turnpike officials also stated that the number of leaks being investigated was down from 1,000 to 500.<ref name=\"evenmorebigleaks\" />\n\nThe problem of leaks is further aggravated by the fact that many of them involve corrosive [[Seawater|salt water]]. This is caused by the proximity of [[Boston Harbor]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]], causing a mix of salt and fresh water leaks in the tunnel. The situation is made worse by [[road salt]] spread in the tunnel to melt ice during freezing weather, or brought in by vehicles passing through.<ref name=\"54m-fix\"/> Salt water and [[salt spray]] are well-known issues that must be dealt with in any [[marine environment]]. It has been reported that \"hundreds of thousands of gallons of salt water are pumped out monthly\" in the Big Dig, and a map has been prepared showing \"hot spots\" where water leakage is especially serious.<ref name=\"CorrosionGraphic\"/> Salt-accelerated corrosion has caused ceiling light fixtures to fail (see below), but can also cause rapid deterioration of embedded [[rebar]] and other [[structural steel]] reinforcements holding the tunnel walls and ceiling in place.<ref name=\"54m-fix\"/>\n\nThe much larger than expected volume of water that must be continuously pumped consumes a correspondingly larger amount of electrical power, and will cause the pumps to wear out much sooner than originally estimated.\n\n===Substandard materials===\n{{update|section|date=December 2012|what happened after the arrests and charges}}\n[[Massachusetts State Police]] searched the offices of [[Aggregate Industries]], the largest concrete supplier for the underground portions of the project, in June 2005.

The principal characters, consisting of Shrek, Princess Fiona, Donkey, Lord Farquaad, the Dragon, Pinocchio, and Gingy, are all portrayed by [[Ben Mingay]], [[Lucy Durack]], Nat Jobe, [[Todd McKenney]], Caleb Vines, [[Marcia Hines]], and Manon Gunderson-Briggs respectively at the start of this tour.<ref>https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/broadway-hit-shrek-the-musical-to-play-at-sydneys-lyric-theatre/news-story/8878c2d1314b697c54d5c9acef4cb99d</ref>\n\n==Synopsis of the Broadway production==\n===Act I===\nTwo ogre parents send their seven-year-old son [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] out of their house and into the world to make his living. They warn him that because of his looks, he will be shunned by the world, and an angry mob will be the last thing he will see before he dies. Some years later, an embittered, grown up Shrek is living contentedly alone in a swamp (\"Big, Bright, Beautiful World\"). However, his solitude is disrupted when a refugee caravan of fairytale creatures show up on his property. They explain of their banishment from the Kingdom of Duloc, by order of the evil [[Lord Farquaad]], who sentenced them into [[penal transportation]] for being freaks, under penalty of death if they ever return (\"Story of my Life\"). Although hesitant, Shrek decides to travel to see Farquaad and try to regain his swamp, along with getting the Fairytale Creatures their homes back, with much encouragement from Pinocchio and the gang (\"The Goodbye Song\").\n\nAlong the way, Shrek rescues a talkative Donkey from some of Farquaad's guards. In return for rescuing him, and offering his friendship, Donkey insists on tagging along to show him the way to Duloc, which Shrek reluctantly agrees to, due to him being lost (\"Don't Let Me Go\").\n \nMeanwhile, in the Kingdom of Duloc, Farquaad is torturing The Gingerbread Man into revealing the whereabouts of other Fairytale Creatures that are still hiding in his Kingdom so he can have them arrested as well. Just as Gingy was going to reveal what he knows, the Captain of the guards arrives and announces that they have found the Magic Mirror. Farquaad asked the mirror if Duloc was the most perfect kingdom of them all. The mirror told him that he's not truly a king yet, but he can become one if he marries a princess. For this episode of \"This Is Your Wife\" (a parody of The Dating Game), the mirror introduces three different princesses for Lord Farquaad to choose from: Cinderella, Snow White, and Princess Fiona; at the suggestion from his henchman, Thelonious, Farquaad chooses Princess Fiona, who is currently trapped in a castle surrounded by lava and guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Accepting this as a task, Farquaad decides to marry her to become king, and rushes out to plan a raffle to see which knight would be worthy enough to embark on a quest to retrieve Fiona before the Mirror can tell him what happens to her at night. The Mirror then shows the audience the story of Fiona's childhood.\n\nA seven-year-old Fiona dreams of the brave knight who, as her storybooks tell her, will one day rescue her from her tower and end her mysterious curse with \"True Love's First Kiss\". As she grows into a teenager, and then a headstrong woman, she becomes a little bit stir-crazy, but she never loses her faith in her fairytales (\"I Know It's Today\").\n\nShrek and Donkey arrive in Duloc where Farquaad expresses his love for his kingdom, accompanied by his cheerful cookie-cut army of Duloc Dancers (\"What's Up Duloc?\"). They approach Farquaad, with him being impressed by Shrek's size and appearance. Farquaad demands that Shrek must rescue Fiona, and in return, he will give Shrek the deed to his swamp.\n \nThe two unlikely friends set off to find Fiona, with Shrek becoming increasingly annoyed with Donkey as time progresses (\"Travel Song\"). After crossing the rickety old bridge and arriving at the castle, Shrek sets off alone to rescue Fiona while Donkey encounters Dragon who initially wants to eat him, but then decides to spare him by keeping him for herself after Donkey manages to charm her (\"Donkey Pot Pie\"). When Shrek finds Fiona, his lack of interest in playing out her desired, romantic rescue scene annoys her, and he drags her off by force (\"This is How a Dream Comes True\"). The two of them reunite with Donkey, and all three attempt to escape while being chased by the angry Dragon and her [[skeleton]] minions. Shrek traps Dragon and they get to a safe point.\n\nFiona then insists that Shrek reveal his identity and is shocked that her rescuer is an ogre and not the Prince Charming her stories indicated. Shrek explains that he is merely her champion; instead, she is to marry Farquaad. The trio begin their journey back to Duloc, but Fiona becomes apprehensive as the sun begins to set. She insists that they rest for the night and that she spend the night alone in a nearby cave. Donkey and Shrek remain awake, with Donkey asking Shrek who he would be, if he did not have to be an ogre anymore. As Shrek opens up to Donkey on who he would wish to be, Fiona transforms into an ogress as part of her curse that happens during sunset, stands apart, alone, and listens (\"Who I'd Be\").\n\n===Act II===\nThe next day, Princess Fiona rises early and sings with a bluebird and dances with a deer (before making the bird explode and throwing the deer off a cliff). She assists the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]] in his rat-charming duties (\"Morning Person\"). Shrek brings down her mood by attempting to give subtle hints about her groom-to-be (\"Men of Farquaad's stature are in ''short'' supply\", \"He's very good at ''small'' talk\", etc.) and mocking her tragic childhood circumstances. The two begin a contest of trying to one-up each other to outdo the others' backstory, but end up revealing their respective pasts (\"I Think I Got You Beat\"). Both admit to being thrown out by their parents; this connection, as well as bonding over a love of disgusting bodily noises, kindles friendship. \n\nBack in Duloc, Lord Farquaad was in his bathtub planning his wedding, and he reveals his own sordid heritage after The Magic Mirror insists that Farquaad should invite his father, but Farquaad refuses, explaining how he abandoned him in the woods as a child (\"The Ballad of Farquaad\").\n\nAs Shrek and Fiona's newfound camaraderie grows into love, Donkey insists, with the help of the [[Three Blind Mice]] from his imagination, that Shrek should gather his courage and romantically engage Fiona (\"Make a Move\"). Shrek, finally beginning to come out of his caustic, protective shell, tries to find the words to explain his feelings to Fiona (\"When Words Fail\").\n \nWhile Shrek is out finding a flower for Fiona, Donkey discovers that Fiona turns into an ogress at night, and she confesses that she was cursed as a child, which is why she was locked away in the tower. Only a kiss from her true love will return her to her proper form, and she asks Donkey to promise never to tell. Shrek arrives near the end of the conversation and misunderstands Fiona's description of herself as an ugly beast, and thinks she is talking about him. Hurt by her presumed opinion, Shrek storms off. \n\nThe next day, transformed back to her human form, Fiona decides to tell Shrek about her curse (\"Morning Person (Reprise)\"). When she tries to explain, Shrek rebuffs her with his \"ugly beast\" overhearing, causing Fiona in turn to misunderstand. Then Farquaad arrives to claim Fiona and tells Shrek he has cleared the swamp of the Fairytale Creatures, and now belongs to Shrek again. While not very impressed with Farquaad, Fiona agrees to marry him and insists that they have the wedding before sunset. As Farquaad and Fiona ride back to Duloc, Donkey tries to explain the misunderstanding to Shrek (who is too angry and upset to listen), and Shrek rejects him as well, declaring that he will return to his swamp alone and build a wall to shield himself from the world (\"Build a Wall\").\n \nMeanwhile, the Fairytale Creatures are on their way to a landfill which is to be their new home, since they were forced to relocate from the swamp. After dealing with the fact that Shrek broke his promise to them, however, Gingy rants that Farquaad's treatment of them is intolerable; just because they are freaks does not mean they deserve to be hated, so he rallies most of the other fairytale creatures into staging a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against Farquaad's rule. Unfortunately, a bitter Pinocchio (remembering they are not allowed back to Duloc), doesn't want his friends to get killed, suggesting they should just keep going, and wait until everything gets better, all the while, wishing to be a real boy. Exasperated by Pinocchio's turndown, Gingy convinces him to join the protest, inspiring him to accept who he is, as all of them have accepted who they are; they gather new confidence and strength in themselves, as they declare that they'll raise their \"Freak Flag\" high against their tormentors (\"Freak Flag\"). Now realizing that they have become something more than friends, and have become a family, Pinocchio now leads his gang back to Duloc to overthrow Farquaad once and for all.\n\nShrek has returned to his once again private swamp, but he misses Fiona. Donkey shows up attempting to seal off his half of the swamp with stone boulders, which Shrek rebuffs. In turn, Donkey angrily berates Shrek for his reclusive and stubborn habits, even to the point of driving off Fiona. An angered Shrek reveals he heard her talking about a hideous creature the night before, and Donkey retorts that they were not talking about him, but of \"someone else\". When a confused Shrek inquires who it was, Donkey, wanting to keep his promise, and still cross with Shrek, refuses to talk. When Shrek apologizes and extends his friendship, Donkey forgives him. The two then go back to Duloc, where Shrek objects to this marriage before Farquaad can kiss Fiona, and Fiona convinces him to let Shrek speak with her. Shrek finally finds the words to express his feelings for Fiona, and he declares his love for her (\"Big Bright Beautiful World (Reprise)\"). However, his declaration of love is mocked by Farquaad. Caught between love and her desire to break the curse, Fiona tries to escape the event. Just then, the Fairytale Creatures storm into the wedding and protest their banishment. They are also accompanied by [[Seven Dwarfs|Grumpy]], one of the [[Seven Dwarfs]], who reveals that he is Farquaad's father, and he kicked Farquaad out at the age of 28 when he wouldn't move out of the basement, revealing Farquaad is a freak as well. During the scuffle, the sun sets, causing Fiona to turn into an ogress in front of everyone. Farquaad, furious and disgusted over the change, orders for Shrek to be [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|drawn and quartered]] along with the Fairytale Creatures and Fiona banished back to her tower. As Farquaad proclaims himself the new King, Shrek whistles for the Dragon, who has now escaped the castle (and is the reason Shrek and Donkey got to the wedding just in time). Dragon then crashes through the window with Donkey and incinerates Farquaad with her fiery breath.\n\nWith Farquaad dead, Shrek and Fiona admit their love for each other and share true love's first kiss. Fiona's curse is broken, and she takes her true form: an ogress. At first, she is ashamed of her looks, but Shrek declares that she is still beautiful. The two ogres begin a new life together (along with Donkey, Dragon, and the Fairytale Creatures) as everyone celebrates their liberation against Farquaad's rule (\"This Is Our Story\"). In the end, Shrek and Fiona (in association with Donkey and Dragon) host their post-wedding party (\"I'm A Believer\").\n\n==Musical numbers==\n\n===Broadway===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n; Act I\n* \"Overture\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"Big Bright Beautiful World\" \u2013 Mama Ogre, Papa Ogre, Shrek\n* \"Story Of My Life\" \u2013 Pinocchio, Elf, Peter Pan, Ugly Duckling, Fairy Godmother, Sugar Plum Fairy, Three Pigs, Wicked Witch, Mama Bear, Mad Hatter, Big Bad Wolf, Humpty Dumpty, White Rabbit, Three Bears, Fairytale Creatures\n* \"Story Of My Life (Tag)\" \u2013 Elf, Fairy Godmother, Pinocchio, Big Bad Wolf, Fairytale Creatures\u2260\n* \"The Goodbye Song\" \u2013 Elf, Fairytale Creatures\u2260\n* \"Don't Let Me Go\" \u2013 Donkey*\n* \"Regiment\" \u2013 Guards\u2260\n* \"I Know It's Today\" \u2013 Young Fiona, Teen Fiona, Fiona\n* \"What's Up, Duloc?\" \u2013 Lord Farquaad, Duloc Performers\n* \"What\u2019s Up, Duloc?

The guitar players double on ukulele, mandolins, electric guitars, and acoustic guitars. The trumpeter doubles on a flugelhorn and a piccolo trumpet. The trombonist doubles on tenor and bass trombones. The bass player doubles on the upright bass, the electric bass, and the 5-string bass guitar. The first reed doubles on alto sax, clarinet, flute, and piccolo. The second reed doubles on soprano sax, baritone sax, tenor sax, flute, bass clarinet, and clarinet. The percussion player plays many ethnic drums such as djembe, congas, bongos, and dumbeck, as well as more common percussion such as timpani, bells, suspended cymbal, xylophone and tambourine.\n\nThe original Broadway orchestration included an additional trumpet, an additional trombone, two more violinists, one more cellist, and two more reed players. In this orchestration, the first reed doubles on piccolo, flute, and recorder. The second reed doubles on oboe, English horn, clarinet, and alto sax. The third reed doubles on flute, clarinet, bass clarinet, soprano sax, and tenor sax. The fourth reed doubles on clarinet, bassoon, and baritone sax.\n\n==Production references==\n* [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] makes a silent [[cameo appearance]] during the \"Travel Song\". He tips his hat to Shrek and Donkey and walks away. Later, a bunny screams after Shrek calls him delicious. [[Hey Diddle Diddle|A cow jumps over the moon, and a dish runs away with a spoon]], while being pursued by the police. Shrek and Donkey later see a giraffe and gazelles which look like the gazelle wheel in ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]'' (an excerpt from \"[[Circle of Life]]\" plays during this part of the song).\n* As with the 2001 film, Shrek ends the song \"Travel Song\" with \"That'll do, Donkey, that'll do\"; this is a reference to the similar phrase in the film ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]'', in which Hoggett reassures \"That'll do, Pig. That'll do.\"\n* King Harold and Queen Lillian originally sang a part during \"Big Bright Beautiful World,\" explaining to Young Fiona that all ogres are monsters unloved by everyone. Now they walk past Young Shrek, taking Young Fiona with them. She waves at Shrek, but they lead her away (the guards preceding them give the impression that they are taking Fiona to her tower). This was later cut out of the Broadway production. A similar part was re-introduced for the national tour and London productions.\n* In \"I Know It's Today\" and \"This is How A Dream Comes True,\" Fiona sings \"Are you there, God, it's me, Fiona?\" which is similar to the book entitled \"[[Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret]]\" by [[Judy Blume]].\n*In \"Morning Person,\" much of the part where Fiona dances with the mice is reminiscent of the nightclub scene in Bob Fosse's \"Sweet Charity.\"\n* Most of the spoken lines are taken from the first film, including the [[Muffin Man]] scene between Farquaad and Gingy, and Fiona explaining the curse to Donkey.\n* \"Welcome to Duloc\" is the only original song from the film sung in the musical. It is now \"What\u2019s Up, Duloc\" and is sung by the Duloc Dancers, who resemble the puppets that sing it in the film.\n* Originally the orchestra played \"I'm a Believer\" after the curtain call, but as of October 2, 2009, it is sung by the entire company at the end of the performance.\n* At the end of \"What's up, Duloc?\" (Reprise), Lord Farquaad references [[Defying Gravity (song)|Defying Gravity]] from the Broadway musical ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'', when he sings \"...and no ones gonna bring me down!\" followed by the famous ending note. Also, the oft-repeated line 'Hey-nonny-nonny-nonny-no' is taken from the song \"Shy\" from ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]''.\n* At the end of \"Forever\", the Dragon's final line is a reference to the ''[[Dreamgirls]]'' song \"[[And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going]]\". In some adaptations of this song in later productions, the Dragon performer appears alongside the puppet (in previous performances, the performer sang off-stage.)\n* [[Julie Andrews]], who played Queen Lillian in ''[[Shrek 2]]'', ''[[Shrek the Third]]'', and ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'', provides the voice for the audio instructions before each performance that reminds the audience to turn off their cell phones, the use of recording devices is forbidden, etc. and \"if you refuse, a terrifying ogre will leap from the stage, lift you from your seat, and drag you far, far away.\"\n* During \"Story of My Life\", one of the show's musical numbers, Mama Bear sings \"Mama's in the mud, Mama's in distress,\" which is a nod to the song \"[[Rose's Turn]]\"  from the musical ''[[Gypsy: A Musical Fable|Gypsy]]''.\n* During \"Freak Flag\" a flag is waved around with a face on it, which resembles the famous logo of young [[Cosette]] from ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'' which is accompanied by a dance similar to \"''[[Do You Hear the People Sing?|Do you hear the people sing]]?\"''.\n* During a part of \"Don't Let Me Go\" on the national tour, Donkey sings to the music of \"[[Take Me or Leave Me]]\" and \"I'll Cover You\" from ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]''. He also makes a reference to \"La Vie Boheme\" from the same musical while chanting things and marching across the stage in the bridge of the song.\n* During \"What's Up, Duloc?,\" the ensemble reference the musical ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''.\n* During a part of \"Don't Let Me Go\" original Broadway recording, Donkey makes reference to \"Part Of Your World\" from ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|Little Mermaid]]''.\n* Donkey sings to Shrek \"Don't speak, don't speak, don't speak,\" referencing Dianne Wiest and John Cusack in \"Bullets Over Broadway.\"\n*The opening of \"Who I'd Be\" is reminiscent of \"[[Bring Him Home (Les Mis\u00e9rables)|Bring Him Home]]\" from '[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]''.\n\n==Recordings==\nThe original Broadway [[cast recording]] was recorded on January 12, 2009, and was released on March 24, 2009, by Decca Broadway Records.<ref>Gans, Andrew.

It was recorded during a live performance of the national tour in Chicago, and features Carrie Compere (Dragon) and Alan Mingo, Jr. (Donkey).\n\nThe original London cast recorded a single of \"I'm a Believer\" for promotional purposes. \n\nAn original Spanish-language cast recording featuring the Madrid cast was recorded between August and September 2011, and released in September. The Spanish album includes later added songs \"Forever\" and \"I'm a Believer\", as well as different orchestrations to the Broadway recording and the arrangements made for the national tour.\n\n==Reception==\nThe musical has received mixed to positive reviews from critics. [[Ben Brantley]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'': \"'Shrek,' for the record, is not bad....  As the title character, a misanthropic green ogre who learns to love, the talented Mr. James is... encumbered with padding and prosthetics....  As the evil, psychologically maimed Lord Farquaad, the very droll Christopher Sieber is required to walk on his knees, with tiny fake legs dangling before him \u2014 an initially funny sight gag that soon drags\". He praises Sutton Foster as \"an inspired, take-charge musical comedian....  Ms. Foster manages both to make fun of and exult in classical musical-comedy moves while creating a real, full character at the same time.\"<ref>Brantley, Ben. [http://theater2.nytimes.com/2008/12/15/theater/reviews/15shrek.html?ref=theater \"The Belching Green Ogre Has a Song in His Heart\"], ''The New York Times'', December 15, 2008.</ref>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted that the production had a reported budget of $24 million.  Any \"theme-park cutesiness is offset by the mischievous humor in David Lindsay-Abaire's book and lyrics. The production's real achievement, however, is that the busy visuals and gargantuan set-pieces never overwhelm the personalities of the actors or their characters. The ensemble is talented and the four leads, in particular, couldn't be better.\"<ref>Rooney, David. [http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117939208.html?categoryid=33&cs=1 \"Shrek the Musical\"], ''Variety'', December 14, 2008.</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Associated Press]]'' said that \"the folks at [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] have done their darndest to make sure we are entertained at ''Shrek the Musical,'' the company's lavish stage adaptation of its hit animated movie. For much of the time, they succeed, thanks to the talent and ingratiating appeal of the show's four principal performers. The show's massive sets and colorful costumes (both courtesy of Tim Hatley) are so visually eye-catching that they often distract from what's going on with the story and score. Composer Jeanine Tesori has written attractive, eclectic, pop-flavored melodies that range from a jaunty 'Travel Song' to a gutsy duet called 'I Got You Beat' for Shrek and Fiona that revels in rude noises.\"  The review also noted that Lindsay-Abaire's lyrics are often fun and quite witty.<ref>Kuchwara, Michael, [https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jkW5fj0fBN1gwr6qABvUtrjnPdRQD952PU5G3 \"A mean green ogre named Shrek moves to Broadway\"], ''Associated Press'', December 14, 2008.</ref>\n\n''[[USA Today]]'' gave the show three and a half stars out of four, writing: \"Shrek, which draws from William Steig's book about a lovable ogre and the DreamWorks animated movie that it inspired, is nonetheless a triumph of comic imagination with a heart as big and warm as Santa's. It is the most ingeniously wacky, transcendently tasteless Broadway musical since ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'', and more family-friendly than that gag-fest.\"  The review also noted, however, that \"Like other musical adaptations of hit films, Shrek... leans heavily on winking satire.  There are the usual nods to more fully realized shows, from ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]'' to ''[[A Chorus Line]]'', and Jeanine Tesori's blandly ingratiating score doesn't feature any songs you're likely to be humming 20 years from now.\"<ref>Gardner, Elysa.

They warn him that because of his looks, he will be shunned by the world, and an angry mob will be the last thing he will see before he dies. Some years later, an embittered, grown up Shrek is living contentedly alone in a swamp (\"Big, Bright, Beautiful World\"). However, his solitude is disrupted when a refugee caravan of fairytale creatures show up on his property. They explain of their banishment from the Kingdom of Duloc, by order of the evil [[Lord Farquaad]], who sentenced them into [[penal transportation]] for being freaks, under penalty of death if they ever return (\"Story of my Life\"). Although hesitant, Shrek decides to travel to see Farquaad and try to regain his swamp, along with getting the Fairytale Creatures their homes back, with much encouragement from Pinocchio and the gang (\"The Goodbye Song\").\n\nAlong the way, Shrek rescues a talkative Donkey from some of Farquaad's guards. In return for rescuing him, and offering his friendship, Donkey insists on tagging along to show him the way to Duloc, which Shrek reluctantly agrees to, due to him being lost (\"Don't Let Me Go\").\n \nMeanwhile, in the Kingdom of Duloc, Farquaad is torturing The Gingerbread Man into revealing the whereabouts of other Fairytale Creatures that are still hiding in his Kingdom so he can have them arrested as well. Just as Gingy was going to reveal what he knows, the Captain of the guards arrives and announces that they have found the Magic Mirror. Farquaad asked the mirror if Duloc was the most perfect kingdom of them all. The mirror told him that he's not truly a king yet, but he can become one if he marries a princess. For this episode of \"This Is Your Wife\" (a parody of The Dating Game), the mirror introduces three different princesses for Lord Farquaad to choose from: Cinderella, Snow White, and Princess Fiona; at the suggestion from his henchman, Thelonious, Farquaad chooses Princess Fiona, who is currently trapped in a castle surrounded by lava and guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Accepting this as a task, Farquaad decides to marry her to become king, and rushes out to plan a raffle to see which knight would be worthy enough to embark on a quest to retrieve Fiona before the Mirror can tell him what happens to her at night. The Mirror then shows the audience the story of Fiona's childhood.\n\nA seven-year-old Fiona dreams of the brave knight who, as her storybooks tell her, will one day rescue her from her tower and end her mysterious curse with \"True Love's First Kiss\". As she grows into a teenager, and then a headstrong woman, she becomes a little bit stir-crazy, but she never loses her faith in her fairytales (\"I Know It's Today\").\n\nShrek and Donkey arrive in Duloc where Farquaad expresses his love for his kingdom, accompanied by his cheerful cookie-cut army of Duloc Dancers (\"What's Up Duloc?\"). They approach Farquaad, with him being impressed by Shrek's size and appearance. Farquaad demands that Shrek must rescue Fiona, and in return, he will give Shrek the deed to his swamp.\n \nThe two unlikely friends set off to find Fiona, with Shrek becoming increasingly annoyed with Donkey as time progresses (\"Travel Song\"). After crossing the rickety old bridge and arriving at the castle, Shrek sets off alone to rescue Fiona while Donkey encounters Dragon who initially wants to eat him, but then decides to spare him by keeping him for herself after Donkey manages to charm her (\"Donkey Pot Pie\"). When Shrek finds Fiona, his lack of interest in playing out her desired, romantic rescue scene annoys her, and he drags her off by force (\"This is How a Dream Comes True\"). The two of them reunite with Donkey, and all three attempt to escape while being chased by the angry Dragon and her [[skeleton]] minions. Shrek traps Dragon and they get to a safe point.\n\nFiona then insists that Shrek reveal his identity and is shocked that her rescuer is an ogre and not the Prince Charming her stories indicated. Shrek explains that he is merely her champion; instead, she is to marry Farquaad. The trio begin their journey back to Duloc, but Fiona becomes apprehensive as the sun begins to set. She insists that they rest for the night and that she spend the night alone in a nearby cave. Donkey and Shrek remain awake, with Donkey asking Shrek who he would be, if he did not have to be an ogre anymore. As Shrek opens up to Donkey on who he would wish to be, Fiona transforms into an ogress as part of her curse that happens during sunset, stands apart, alone, and listens (\"Who I'd Be\").\n\n===Act II===\nThe next day, Princess Fiona rises early and sings with a bluebird and dances with a deer (before making the bird explode and throwing the deer off a cliff). She assists the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]] in his rat-charming duties (\"Morning Person\"). Shrek brings down her mood by attempting to give subtle hints about her groom-to-be (\"Men of Farquaad's stature are in ''short'' supply\", \"He's very good at ''small'' talk\", etc.) and mocking her tragic childhood circumstances. The two begin a contest of trying to one-up each other to outdo the others' backstory, but end up revealing their respective pasts (\"I Think I Got You Beat\"). Both admit to being thrown out by their parents; this connection, as well as bonding over a love of disgusting bodily noises, kindles friendship. \n\nBack in Duloc, Lord Farquaad was in his bathtub planning his wedding, and he reveals his own sordid heritage after The Magic Mirror insists that Farquaad should invite his father, but Farquaad refuses, explaining how he abandoned him in the woods as a child (\"The Ballad of Farquaad\").\n\nAs Shrek and Fiona's newfound camaraderie grows into love, Donkey insists, with the help of the [[Three Blind Mice]] from his imagination, that Shrek should gather his courage and romantically engage Fiona (\"Make a Move\"). Shrek, finally beginning to come out of his caustic, protective shell, tries to find the words to explain his feelings to Fiona (\"When Words Fail\").\n \nWhile Shrek is out finding a flower for Fiona, Donkey discovers that Fiona turns into an ogress at night, and she confesses that she was cursed as a child, which is why she was locked away in the tower. Only a kiss from her true love will return her to her proper form, and she asks Donkey to promise never to tell. Shrek arrives near the end of the conversation and misunderstands Fiona's description of herself as an ugly beast, and thinks she is talking about him. Hurt by her presumed opinion, Shrek storms off. \n\nThe next day, transformed back to her human form, Fiona decides to tell Shrek about her curse (\"Morning Person (Reprise)\"). When she tries to explain, Shrek rebuffs her with his \"ugly beast\" overhearing, causing Fiona in turn to misunderstand. Then Farquaad arrives to claim Fiona and tells Shrek he has cleared the swamp of the Fairytale Creatures, and now belongs to Shrek again. While not very impressed with Farquaad, Fiona agrees to marry him and insists that they have the wedding before sunset. As Farquaad and Fiona ride back to Duloc, Donkey tries to explain the misunderstanding to Shrek (who is too angry and upset to listen), and Shrek rejects him as well, declaring that he will return to his swamp alone and build a wall to shield himself from the world (\"Build a Wall\").\n \nMeanwhile, the Fairytale Creatures are on their way to a landfill which is to be their new home, since they were forced to relocate from the swamp. After dealing with the fact that Shrek broke his promise to them, however, Gingy rants that Farquaad's treatment of them is intolerable; just because they are freaks does not mean they deserve to be hated, so he rallies most of the other fairytale creatures into staging a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against Farquaad's rule. Unfortunately, a bitter Pinocchio (remembering they are not allowed back to Duloc), doesn't want his friends to get killed, suggesting they should just keep going, and wait until everything gets better, all the while, wishing to be a real boy. Exasperated by Pinocchio's turndown, Gingy convinces him to join the protest, inspiring him to accept who he is, as all of them have accepted who they are; they gather new confidence and strength in themselves, as they declare that they'll raise their \"Freak Flag\" high against their tormentors (\"Freak Flag\"). Now realizing that they have become something more than friends, and have become a family, Pinocchio now leads his gang back to Duloc to overthrow Farquaad once and for all.\n\nShrek has returned to his once again private swamp, but he misses Fiona. Donkey shows up attempting to seal off his half of the swamp with stone boulders, which Shrek rebuffs. In turn, Donkey angrily berates Shrek for his reclusive and stubborn habits, even to the point of driving off Fiona. An angered Shrek reveals he heard her talking about a hideous creature the night before, and Donkey retorts that they were not talking about him, but of \"someone else\". When a confused Shrek inquires who it was, Donkey, wanting to keep his promise, and still cross with Shrek, refuses to talk. When Shrek apologizes and extends his friendship, Donkey forgives him. The two then go back to Duloc, where Shrek objects to this marriage before Farquaad can kiss Fiona, and Fiona convinces him to let Shrek speak with her. Shrek finally finds the words to express his feelings for Fiona, and he declares his love for her (\"Big Bright Beautiful World (Reprise)\"). However, his declaration of love is mocked by Farquaad. Caught between love and her desire to break the curse, Fiona tries to escape the event. Just then, the Fairytale Creatures storm into the wedding and protest their banishment. They are also accompanied by [[Seven Dwarfs|Grumpy]], one of the [[Seven Dwarfs]], who reveals that he is Farquaad's father, and he kicked Farquaad out at the age of 28 when he wouldn't move out of the basement, revealing Farquaad is a freak as well. During the scuffle, the sun sets, causing Fiona to turn into an ogress in front of everyone. Farquaad, furious and disgusted over the change, orders for Shrek to be [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|drawn and quartered]] along with the Fairytale Creatures and Fiona banished back to her tower. As Farquaad proclaims himself the new King, Shrek whistles for the Dragon, who has now escaped the castle (and is the reason Shrek and Donkey got to the wedding just in time). Dragon then crashes through the window with Donkey and incinerates Farquaad with her fiery breath.\n\nWith Farquaad dead, Shrek and Fiona admit their love for each other and share true love's first kiss. Fiona's curse is broken, and she takes her true form: an ogress. At first, she is ashamed of her looks, but Shrek declares that she is still beautiful.

The guitar players double on ukulele, mandolins, electric guitars, and acoustic guitars. The trumpeter doubles on a flugelhorn and a piccolo trumpet. The trombonist doubles on tenor and bass trombones. The bass player doubles on the upright bass, the electric bass, and the 5-string bass guitar. The first reed doubles on alto sax, clarinet, flute, and piccolo. The second reed doubles on soprano sax, baritone sax, tenor sax, flute, bass clarinet, and clarinet. The percussion player plays many ethnic drums such as djembe, congas, bongos, and dumbeck, as well as more common percussion such as timpani, bells, suspended cymbal, xylophone and tambourine.\n\nThe original Broadway orchestration included an additional trumpet, an additional trombone, two more violinists, one more cellist, and two more reed players. In this orchestration, the first reed doubles on piccolo, flute, and recorder. The second reed doubles on oboe, English horn, clarinet, and alto sax. The third reed doubles on flute, clarinet, bass clarinet, soprano sax, and tenor sax. The fourth reed doubles on clarinet, bassoon, and baritone sax.\n\n==Production references==\n* [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] makes a silent [[cameo appearance]] during the \"Travel Song\". He tips his hat to Shrek and Donkey and walks away. Later, a bunny screams after Shrek calls him delicious. [[Hey Diddle Diddle|A cow jumps over the moon, and a dish runs away with a spoon]], while being pursued by the police. Shrek and Donkey later see a giraffe and gazelles which look like the gazelle wheel in ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]'' (an excerpt from \"[[Circle of Life]]\" plays during this part of the song).\n* As with the 2001 film, Shrek ends the song \"Travel Song\" with \"That'll do, Donkey, that'll do\"; this is a reference to the similar phrase in the film ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]'', in which Hoggett reassures \"That'll do, Pig. That'll do.\"\n* King Harold and Queen Lillian originally sang a part during \"Big Bright Beautiful World,\" explaining to Young Fiona that all ogres are monsters unloved by everyone. Now they walk past Young Shrek, taking Young Fiona with them. She waves at Shrek, but they lead her away (the guards preceding them give the impression that they are taking Fiona to her tower). This was later cut out of the Broadway production. A similar part was re-introduced for the national tour and London productions.\n* In \"I Know It's Today\" and \"This is How A Dream Comes True,\" Fiona sings \"Are you there, God, it's me, Fiona?\" which is similar to the book entitled \"[[Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret]]\" by [[Judy Blume]].\n*In \"Morning Person,\" much of the part where Fiona dances with the mice is reminiscent of the nightclub scene in Bob Fosse's \"Sweet Charity.\"\n* Most of the spoken lines are taken from the first film, including the [[Muffin Man]] scene between Farquaad and Gingy, and Fiona explaining the curse to Donkey.\n* \"Welcome to Duloc\" is the only original song from the film sung in the musical. It is now \"What\u2019s Up, Duloc\" and is sung by the Duloc Dancers, who resemble the puppets that sing it in the film.\n* Originally the orchestra played \"I'm a Believer\" after the curtain call, but as of October 2, 2009, it is sung by the entire company at the end of the performance.\n* At the end of \"What's up, Duloc?\" (Reprise), Lord Farquaad references [[Defying Gravity (song)|Defying Gravity]] from the Broadway musical ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'', when he sings \"...and no ones gonna bring me down!\" followed by the famous ending note. Also, the oft-repeated line 'Hey-nonny-nonny-nonny-no' is taken from the song \"Shy\" from ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]''.\n* At the end of \"Forever\", the Dragon's final line is a reference to the ''[[Dreamgirls]]'' song \"[[And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going]]\". In some adaptations of this song in later productions, the Dragon performer appears alongside the puppet (in previous performances, the performer sang off-stage.)\n* [[Julie Andrews]], who played Queen Lillian in ''[[Shrek 2]]'', ''[[Shrek the Third]]'', and ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'', provides the voice for the audio instructions before each performance that reminds the audience to turn off their cell phones, the use of recording devices is forbidden, etc. and \"if you refuse, a terrifying ogre will leap from the stage, lift you from your seat, and drag you far, far away.\"\n* During \"Story of My Life\", one of the show's musical numbers, Mama Bear sings \"Mama's in the mud, Mama's in distress,\" which is a nod to the song \"[[Rose's Turn]]\"  from the musical ''[[Gypsy: A Musical Fable|Gypsy]]''.\n* During \"Freak Flag\" a flag is waved around with a face on it, which resembles the famous logo of young [[Cosette]] from ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'' which is accompanied by a dance similar to \"''[[Do You Hear the People Sing?|Do you hear the people sing]]?\"''.\n* During a part of \"Don't Let Me Go\" on the national tour, Donkey sings to the music of \"[[Take Me or Leave Me]]\" and \"I'll Cover You\" from ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]''. He also makes a reference to \"La Vie Boheme\" from the same musical while chanting things and marching across the stage in the bridge of the song.\n* During \"What's Up, Duloc?,\" the ensemble reference the musical ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''.\n* During a part of \"Don't Let Me Go\" original Broadway recording, Donkey makes reference to \"Part Of Your World\" from ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|Little Mermaid]]''.\n* Donkey sings to Shrek \"Don't speak, don't speak, don't speak,\" referencing Dianne Wiest and John Cusack in \"Bullets Over Broadway.\"\n*The opening of \"Who I'd Be\" is reminiscent of \"[[Bring Him Home (Les Mis\u00e9rables)|Bring Him Home]]\" from '[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]''.\n\n==Recordings==\nThe original Broadway [[cast recording]] was recorded on January 12, 2009, and was released on March 24, 2009, by Decca Broadway Records.<ref>Gans, Andrew.

It was recorded during a live performance of the national tour in Chicago, and features Carrie Compere (Dragon) and Alan Mingo, Jr. (Donkey).\n\nThe original London cast recorded a single of \"I'm a Believer\" for promotional purposes. \n\nAn original Spanish-language cast recording featuring the Madrid cast was recorded between August and September 2011, and released in September. The Spanish album includes later added songs \"Forever\" and \"I'm a Believer\", as well as different orchestrations to the Broadway recording and the arrangements made for the national tour.\n\n==Reception==\nThe musical has received mixed to positive reviews from critics. [[Ben Brantley]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'': \"'Shrek,' for the record, is not bad....  As the title character, a misanthropic green ogre who learns to love, the talented Mr. James is... encumbered with padding and prosthetics....  As the evil, psychologically maimed Lord Farquaad, the very droll Christopher Sieber is required to walk on his knees, with tiny fake legs dangling before him \u2014 an initially funny sight gag that soon drags\". He praises Sutton Foster as \"an inspired, take-charge musical comedian....  Ms. Foster manages both to make fun of and exult in classical musical-comedy moves while creating a real, full character at the same time.\"<ref>Brantley, Ben. [http://theater2.nytimes.com/2008/12/15/theater/reviews/15shrek.html?ref=theater \"The Belching Green Ogre Has a Song in His Heart\"], ''The New York Times'', December 15, 2008.</ref>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted that the production had a reported budget of $24 million.  Any \"theme-park cutesiness is offset by the mischievous humor in David Lindsay-Abaire's book and lyrics. The production's real achievement, however, is that the busy visuals and gargantuan set-pieces never overwhelm the personalities of the actors or their characters. The ensemble is talented and the four leads, in particular, couldn't be better.\"<ref>Rooney, David. [http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117939208.html?categoryid=33&cs=1 \"Shrek the Musical\"], ''Variety'', December 14, 2008.</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Associated Press]]'' said that \"the folks at [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] have done their darndest to make sure we are entertained at ''Shrek the Musical,'' the company's lavish stage adaptation of its hit animated movie. For much of the time, they succeed, thanks to the talent and ingratiating appeal of the show's four principal performers. The show's massive sets and colorful costumes (both courtesy of Tim Hatley) are so visually eye-catching that they often distract from what's going on with the story and score. Composer Jeanine Tesori has written attractive, eclectic, pop-flavored melodies that range from a jaunty 'Travel Song' to a gutsy duet called 'I Got You Beat' for Shrek and Fiona that revels in rude noises.\"  The review also noted that Lindsay-Abaire's lyrics are often fun and quite witty.<ref>Kuchwara, Michael, [https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jkW5fj0fBN1gwr6qABvUtrjnPdRQD952PU5G3 \"A mean green ogre named Shrek moves to Broadway\"], ''Associated Press'', December 14, 2008.</ref>\n\n''[[USA Today]]'' gave the show three and a half stars out of four, writing: \"Shrek, which draws from William Steig's book about a lovable ogre and the DreamWorks animated movie that it inspired, is nonetheless a triumph of comic imagination with a heart as big and warm as Santa's. It is the most ingeniously wacky, transcendently tasteless Broadway musical since ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'', and more family-friendly than that gag-fest.\"  The review also noted, however, that \"Like other musical adaptations of hit films, Shrek... leans heavily on winking satire.  There are the usual nods to more fully realized shows, from ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]'' to ''[[A Chorus Line]]'', and Jeanine Tesori's blandly ingratiating score doesn't feature any songs you're likely to be humming 20 years from now.\"<ref>Gardner, Elysa.

Monomeric \u03b1-synuclein is natively unfolded in solution but can also bind to membranes in an \u03b1-helical form. It seems likely that these two species exist in equilibrium within the cell, although this is unproven. From in vitro work, it is clear that unfolded monomer can aggregate first into small oligomeric species that can be stabilized by \u03b2-sheet-like interactions and then into higher molecular weight insoluble fibrils. In a cellular context, there is some evidence that the presence of lipids can promote oligomer formation: \u03b1-synuclein can also form annular, pore-like structures that interact with membranes. The deposition of \u03b1-synuclein into pathological structures such as Lewy bodies is probably a late event that occurs in some neurons. On the left hand side are some of the known modifiers of this process. Electrical activity in neurons changes the association of \u03b1-synuclein with vesicles and may also stimulate polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2), which has been shown to phosphorylate \u03b1-synuclein at Ser129. Other kinases have also been proposed to be involved. As well as phosphorylation, truncation through proteases such as calpains, and nitration, probably through nitric oxide (NO) or other reactive nitrogen species that are present during inflammation, all modify synuclein such that it has a higher tendency to aggregate. The addition of ubiquitin (shown as a black spot) to Lewy bodies is probably a secondary process to deposition. On the right are some of the proposed cellular targets for \u03b1-synuclein mediated toxicity, which include (from top to bottom) ER-golgi transport, synaptic vesicles, mitochondria and lysosomes and other proteolytic machinery. In each of these cases, it is proposed that \u03b1-synuclein has detrimental effects, listed below each arrow, although at this time it is not clear if any of these are either necessary or sufficient for toxicity in neurons.\n\n== Protein-protein interactions ==\n\nAlpha-synuclein has been shown to [[Protein-protein interaction|interact]] with\n* [[Dopamine transporter]],<ref name=\"pmid12672538\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wersinger C, Sidhu A | title = Attenuation of dopamine transporter activity by alpha-synuclein | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 340 | issue = 3 | pages = 189\u201392 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12672538 | doi = 10.1016/S0304-3940(03)00097-1 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid11292651\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee FJ, Liu F, Pristupa ZB, Niznik HB | title = Direct binding and functional coupling of alpha-synuclein to the dopamine transporters accelerate dopamine-induced apoptosis | journal = FASEB Journal | volume = 15 | issue = 6 | pages = 916\u201326 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11292651 | doi = 10.1096/fj.00-0334com }}</ref>\n* [[Parkin (ligase)]],<ref name=\"pmid11588587\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Choi P, Golts N, Snyder H, Chong M, Petrucelli L, Hardy J, Sparkman D, Cochran E, Lee JM, Wolozin B | display-authors = 6 | title = Co-association of parkin and alpha-synuclein | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 12 | issue = 13 | pages = 2839\u201343 | date = September 2001 | pmid = 11588587 | doi = 10.1097/00001756-200109170-00017 | author10-link = Benjamin Wolozin }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid18195004\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kawahara K, Hashimoto M, Bar-On P, Ho GJ, Crews L, Mizuno H, Rockenstein E, Imam SZ, Masliah E | display-authors = 6 | title = alpha-Synuclein aggregates interfere with Parkin solubility and distribution: role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 283 | issue = 11 | pages = 6979\u201387 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18195004 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M710418200 }}</ref>\n* [[Phospholipase D1]],<ref name=\"pmid11821392\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ahn BH, Rhim H, Kim SY, Sung YM, Lee MY, Choi JY, Wolozin B, Chang JS, Lee YH, Kwon TK, Chung KC, Yoon SH, Hahn SJ, Kim MS, Jo YH, Min DS | display-authors = 6 | title = alpha-Synuclein interacts with phospholipase D isozymes and inhibits pervanadate-induced phospholipase D activation in human embryonic kidney-293 cells | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 277 | issue = 14 | pages = 12334\u201342 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11821392 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M110414200 | url = http://kumel.medlib.dsmc.or.kr/bitstream/2015.oak/33740/1/oak-aaa-2339.pdf }}</ref>\n* [[SNCAIP]],<ref name=\"pmid12044636\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Neystat M, Rzhetskaya M, Kholodilov N, Burke RE | title = Analysis of synphilin-1 and synuclein interactions by yeast two-hybrid beta-galactosidase liquid assay | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 325 | issue = 2 | pages = 119\u201323 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12044636 | doi = 10.1016/S0304-3940(02)00253-7 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid1742726\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Reed JC, Meister L, Tanaka S, Cuddy M, Yum S, Geyer C, Pleasure D | title = Differential expression of bcl2 protooncogene in neuroblastoma and other human tumor cell lines of neural origin | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 51 | issue = 24 | pages = 6529\u201338 | date = December 1991 | pmid = 1742726 | doi =  }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid11331421\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kawamata H, McLean PJ, Sharma N, Hyman BT | title = Interaction of alpha-synuclein and synphilin-1: effect of Parkinson's disease-associated mutations | journal = Journal of Neurochemistry | volume = 77 | issue = 3 | pages = 929\u201334 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11331421 | doi = 10.1046/j.1471-4159.2001.00301.x }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid10319874\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Engelender S, Kaminsky Z, Guo X, Sharp AH, Amaravi RK, Kleiderlein JJ, Margolis RL, Troncoso JC, Lanahan AA, Worley PF, Dawson VL, Dawson TM, Ross CA | display-authors = 6 | title = Synphilin-1 associates with alpha-synuclein and promotes the formation of cytosolic inclusions | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 110\u20134 | date = May 1999 | pmid = 10319874 | doi = 10.1038/8820 | author12-link = Ted M.

Monomeric \u03b1-synuclein is natively unfolded in solution but can also bind to membranes in an \u03b1-helical form. It seems likely that these two species exist in equilibrium within the cell, although this is unproven. From in vitro work, it is clear that unfolded monomer can aggregate first into small oligomeric species that can be stabilized by \u03b2-sheet-like interactions and then into higher molecular weight insoluble fibrils. In a cellular context, there is some evidence that the presence of lipids can promote oligomer formation: \u03b1-synuclein can also form annular, pore-like structures that interact with membranes. The deposition of \u03b1-synuclein into pathological structures such as Lewy bodies is probably a late event that occurs in some neurons. On the left hand side are some of the known modifiers of this process. Electrical activity in neurons changes the association of \u03b1-synuclein with vesicles and may also stimulate polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2), which has been shown to phosphorylate \u03b1-synuclein at Ser129. Other kinases have also been proposed to be involved. As well as phosphorylation, truncation through proteases such as calpains, and nitration, probably through nitric oxide (NO) or other reactive nitrogen species that are present during inflammation, all modify synuclein such that it has a higher tendency to aggregate. The addition of ubiquitin (shown as a black spot) to Lewy bodies is probably a secondary process to deposition. On the right are some of the proposed cellular targets for \u03b1-synuclein mediated toxicity, which include (from top to bottom) ER-golgi transport, synaptic vesicles, mitochondria and lysosomes and other proteolytic machinery.

{"title_page": "Alpha-glucosidase inhibitor", "text_new": "'''Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors''' ('''AGIs''') are oral [[anti-diabetic drug]]s used for [[diabetes mellitus type 2]] that work by preventing the digestion of carbohydrates (such as [[starch]] and [[sucrose|table sugar]]). Carbohydrates are normally converted into simple sugars ([[monosaccharide]]s) by alpha-glucosidase enzymes present on cells lining the intestine, enabling monosaccharides to be absorbed through the intestine.  Hence, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors reduce the impact of dietary carbohydrates on [[blood sugar]].\n\n==Examples and differences==\nExamples of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors include:\n* [[Acarbose]]- Precose or Glucobay\n* [[Miglitol]] \u2013 Glyset\n* [[Voglibose]]\n\nEven though the drugs have a similar mechanism of action, there are subtle differences between acarbose and miglitol.  Acarbose is an [[oligosaccharide]], whereas miglitol resembles a [[monosaccharide]].  Miglitol is fairly well absorbed by the body, as opposed to acarbose.  Moreover, acarbose inhibits pancreatic alpha-amylase in addition to alpha-glucosidase.\n\n==Natural alpha glucosidase inhibitors==\nThere are a large number of natural products with alpha-glucosidase inhibitor action.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2174/157339910791658826 |title=Antidiabetic Medicinal Plants as a Source of Alpha Glucosidase Inhibitors |year=2010 |last1=Benalla |first1=Wafaa |last2=Bellahcen |first2=Said |last3=Bnouham |first3=Mohamed |journal=Current Diabetes Reviews |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=247\u201354 |pmid=20522017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4268/cjcmm20101229 |script-title=zh:\u836f\u7528\u690d\u7269\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u03b1-\u8461\u8404\u7cd6\u82f7\u9176\u6291\u5236\u5242\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55 |trans-title=Development of \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor from medicinal herbs |language=Chinese |year=2010 |first1=Fang |last1=Ji |first2=Guochun |last2=Xiao |first3=Li |last3=Dong |first4=Zijiao |last4=Ma |first5=Jingman |last5=Ni |journal=China Journal of Chinese Materia Medica |volume=35 |issue=12 |pmid=20815224 |pages=1633\u201340}}</ref>\n\nFor example, research has shown the culinary mushroom [[Maitake]] (''Grifola frondosa'') has a [[blood sugar|hypoglycemic]] effect.<ref name=\"pmid11903406\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1464-5491.2001.00532-5.x |title=A possible hypoglycaemic effect of maitake mushroom on Type 2 diabetic patients |year=2001 |last1=Konno |first1=S. |last2=Tortorelis |first2=D.

First Published October 13, 2014 https://doi.org/10.1177/0897190014549837</ref>\n\n==Mechanism of action==\nAlpha-glucosidase inhibitors are [[saccharide]]s that act as [[competitive inhibitor]]s of enzymes needed to digest [[carbohydrate]]s: specifically [[alpha-glucosidase]] enzymes in the brush border of the small intestines. The membrane-bound intestinal [[alpha-glucosidase]]s hydrolyze [[oligosaccharide]]s, [[trisaccharide]]s, and [[disaccharide]]s to [[glucose]] and other monosaccharides in the small intestine.\n\nAcarbose also blocks pancreatic alpha-amylase in addition to inhibiting membrane-bound alpha-glucosidases.  [[Pancreatic]] [[alpha-amylase]] hydrolyzes complex starches to [[oligosaccharides]] in the lumen of the small intestine.\n\nInhibition of these enzyme systems reduces the rate of digestion of carbohydrates. Less glucose is absorbed because the carbohydrates are not broken down into glucose molecules. In [[diabetic]] patients, the short-term effect of these drugs therapies is to decrease current blood glucose levels: the long-term effect is a small reduction in [[glycosylated hemoglobin|hemoglobin <sub>A1c</sub>]] level.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Samantha J. |last1=Venable |first2=Diane S. |last2=Aschenbrenner |title=Drug Therapy In Nursing |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-4839-9 |oclc= |doi= |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/drugtherapyinnur00asch }}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Dosing==\nSince alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are competitive inhibitors of digestive enzymes, they must be taken at the start of main meals to have maximal effect.  Their effects on blood sugar levels following meals will depend on the amount of complex carbohydrates in the meal.\n\n==Side effects and precautions==\nSince alpha-glucosidase inhibitors prevent the degradation of complex carbohydrates into glucose, the carbohydrates will remain in the intestine.

Carbohydrates are normally converted into simple sugars ([[monosaccharide]]s) by alpha-glucosidase enzymes present on cells lining the intestine, enabling monosaccharides to be absorbed through the intestine.  Hence, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors reduce the impact of dietary carbohydrates on [[blood sugar]].\n\n==Examples and differences==\nExamples of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors include:\n* [[Acarbose]]- Precose or Glucobay\n* [[Miglitol]] \u2013 Glyset\n* [[Voglibose]]\n\nEven though the drugs have a similar mechanism of action, there are subtle differences between acarbose and miglitol.  Acarbose is an [[oligosaccharide]], whereas miglitol resembles a [[monosaccharide]].  Miglitol is fairly well absorbed by the body, as opposed to acarbose.  Moreover, acarbose inhibits pancreatic alpha-amylase in addition to alpha-glucosidase.\n\n==Natural alpha glucosidase inhibitors==\nThere are a large number of natural products with alpha-glucosidase inhibitor action.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2174/157339910791658826 |title=Antidiabetic Medicinal Plants as a Source of Alpha Glucosidase Inhibitors |year=2010 |last1=Benalla |first1=Wafaa |last2=Bellahcen |first2=Said |last3=Bnouham |first3=Mohamed |journal=Current Diabetes Reviews |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=247\u201354 |pmid=20522017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4268/cjcmm20101229 |script-title=zh:\u836f\u7528\u690d\u7269\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u03b1-\u8461\u8404\u7cd6\u82f7\u9176\u6291\u5236\u5242\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55 |trans-title=Development of \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor from medicinal herbs |language=Chinese |year=2010 |first1=Fang |last1=Ji |first2=Guochun |last2=Xiao |first3=Li |last3=Dong |first4=Zijiao |last4=Ma |first5=Jingman |last5=Ni |journal=China Journal of Chinese Materia Medica |volume=35 |issue=12 |pmid=20815224 |pages=1633\u201340}}</ref>\n\nFor example, research has shown the culinary mushroom [[Maitake]] (''Grifola frondosa'') has a [[blood sugar|hypoglycemic]] effect.<ref name=\"pmid11903406\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1464-5491.2001.00532-5.x |title=A possible hypoglycaemic effect of maitake mushroom on Type 2 diabetic patients |year=2001 |last1=Konno |first1=S. |last2=Tortorelis |first2=D.

The membrane-bound intestinal [[alpha-glucosidase]]s hydrolyze [[oligosaccharide]]s, [[trisaccharide]]s, and [[disaccharide]]s to [[glucose]] and other monosaccharides in the small intestine.\n\nAcarbose also blocks pancreatic alpha-amylase in addition to inhibiting membrane-bound alpha-glucosidases.  [[Pancreatic]] [[alpha-amylase]] hydrolyzes complex starches to [[oligosaccharides]] in the lumen of the small intestine.\n\nInhibition of these enzyme systems reduces the rate of digestion of carbohydrates. Less glucose is absorbed because the carbohydrates are not broken down into glucose molecules. In [[diabetic]] patients, the short-term effect of these drugs therapies is to decrease current blood glucose levels: the long-term effect is a small reduction in [[glycosylated hemoglobin|hemoglobin <sub>A1c</sub>]] level.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Samantha J. |last1=Venable |first2=Diane S. |last2=Aschenbrenner |title=Drug Therapy In Nursing |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-4839-9 |oclc= |doi= |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/drugtherapyinnur00asch }}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Dosing==\nSince alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are competitive inhibitors of digestive enzymes, they must be taken at the start of main meals to have maximal effect.  Their effects on blood sugar levels following meals will depend on the amount of complex carbohydrates in the meal.\n\n==Side effects and precautions==\nSince alpha-glucosidase inhibitors prevent the degradation of complex carbohydrates into glucose, the carbohydrates will remain in the intestine.  In the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], bacteria will digest the complex carbohydrates, thereby causing gastrointestinal side effects such as [[flatulence]] and [[diarrhea]].
