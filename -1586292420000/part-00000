Carney Jr.]] (son)\n|laterwork= Chairman of the Board, Bath Iron Works\n}}\n'''Robert Bostwick Carney''' (March 26, 1895&nbsp;\u2013 June 25, 1990) was an [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]] in the [[United States Navy]] who served as commander-in-chief of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]] forces in Southern Europe (1951\u20131953) and then as [[Chief of Naval Operations]] (1953\u20131954) during the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower administration]].\n\n==Early years==\nBorn in [[Vallejo, California]], Carney graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 1916. He served in [[World War I]], seeing combat against German [[U-boat]]s.\n\n==Between wars==\nCarney served as Flag Secretary to Admiral [[Louis R. de Steiguer]] during the mid-1920s during de Steiguer's time in command of various battleship forces. Their relationship was not happy, mainly due to de Steiguer's imperious manner described by Carney as \"constant pressure, irascibility, criticism, and unpleasantness\".\n\nFamously, Carney eventually marched into de Steiguer's cabin, snapped, \"Admiral, I just want to tell you I think you are a goddamn rotten son of a bitch,\" and stormed out. After failing to retrieve Carney with a [[US Marines|Marine]] orderly, de Steiguer visited Carney's cabin in person, said, \"Sonny, you've been working too hard. You and I are going ashore\" after which he took Carney on an epic drinking binge. Carney ultimately concluded that his three years with de Steiguer had been a valuable experience, but not one he would have chosen to repeat.<ref>Taussig, Betty Carney (1995), A Warrior for Freedom, Manhattan, Kansas: Sunflower University Press, at 42\u201343</ref>\n\n==World War II==\nIn February 1941, then Commander Carney was recalled from duty in the Pacific to assist in organizing, equipping, and training a special Surface-Air Force, having as its mission the protection of shipping against [[submarine]] and air attack. This force became fully involved in convoy escort prior to the involvement of the United States into the war. From September 13, 1941,<ref name=\"proceedings\">Carney, Robert B., ADM USN \"Comment and Discussion\" ''United States Naval Institute Proceedings'' January 1976 p.74</ref> until April 1942, this force, under command of Vice Admiral [[Arthur L. Bristol, Jr.]], escorted over 2,600 ships on the ocean lanes while suffering the loss of only six ships.\n\nFrom October 15, 1942, until July 1943 Carney commanded the [[cruiser]] {{USS|Denver|CL-58|6}} in the Pacific Theater. He was twice decorated for engagements in the [[Solomon Islands]] campaign, earning the [[Bronze Star Medal]] with Combat \"V\" for meritorious service as Commanding Officer of ''Denver'' while attached to a task group of Admiral [[William Halsey]]'s [[United States Third Fleet|Third Fleet]] during operations against the Japanese-held Islands of [[Kolombangara]], [[Shortland Islands|Shortland]]. Off [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] the night of July 26, 1943 he took advantage of poor weather to lay a large quantity of mines along [[sea lane]]s around the island, and then delivered a naval bombardment against the Japanese shore installations.\n\nOn July 29, 1943, Carney was appointed [[Chief of Staff]] to Halsey, and was promoted to [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]]. At the time Halsey was Commander, [[South Pacific Force]], a responsibility which included all ground, sea, and air forces in the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] area. Carney later wrote that \"Admiral Halsey unfailingly gave credit to his subordinates for successes achieved, and took all blame for failures on his own shoulders.\" While in this assignment, Carney was awarded his second [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]] for his contributions to the overall strategy and in organizing the logistic support of the Allied Forces in the South Pacific, the citation stating, in part:\n{{quote|Displaying sound judgement and distinctive tactical ability, he conceived and correlated the many offensive operations carried out in the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Bismarck Archipelago]] areas. Through his comprehensive knowledge of [[logistics]] and his expert planning, he enabled our Forces to exert their greatest strength against the enemy and administer a series of crushing defeats on the Japanese.}}\n\nWhen Halsey assumed command of the Third Fleet in the Central Pacific in June 1944, Carney accompanied him as Chief of Staff. Carney participated in the amphibious invasions of [[Palau]] and [[Invasion of Lingayen Gulf|Lingayen]], and the naval [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]]. It was during this engagement that Carney famously confronted an enraged Halsey. During Halsey's run to the north in tracking down the Japanese carriers, he received numerous calls from Admiral [[Thomas C. Kinkaid]]'s Seventh Fleet, whose escort carriers were under attack from a Japanese battle group of battleships, cruisers and destroyers. Then, shortly after 10:00 hours, an anxious message was received from Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]]: \"Where is repeat where is Task Force 34? The world wonders\".<ref name=\"Willmott\">{{cite book |last=Willmott |first=H. P. |title=The Battle of Leyte Gulf: The Last Fleet Action |publisher=Indiana University Press |pages=192\u2013197 |chapter=Six, The Great Day of Wrath |isbn=9780253345288}}</ref> The tail end of this message, [[The world wonders]], was intended as padding designed to confuse enemy decoders, but was mistakenly left in the message when it was handed to Halsey. The inquiry appeared to be a rebuke. The fiery Halsey threw his hat on the deck of the bridge and began cursing. Finally Carney confronted him, telling Halsey \"Stop it! What the hell's the matter with you? Pull yourself together.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,793941,00.html#ixzz1aL8AA1Tz |title=Books: The General and the Admiral |work=Time |date=November 10, 1947}}</ref> Halsey regained his composure, and later turned the fleet south to support Seventh Fleet.\n\nLater, Carney continued to assist Halsey as Chief of Staff during his operations in the [[Okinawa]] campaign and the carrier air raids against Japanese air fields in Vietnam and [[Taiwan|Formosa]] in the [[South China Sea]]. In 1945, Third Fleet was striking targets in the Japanese homeland itself, launching attacks on Tokyo, the [[Bombing of Kure (July 1945)|naval base at Kure]] and the northern Japanese island of [[Hokkaid\u014d]], as well as the [[Allied naval bombardments of Japan during World War II|bombardments of a number of Japanese coastal cities]] in preparation for an invasion of Japan which never happened.\n\nCarney arranged with Japanese emissaries for the entry of the Third Fleet into [[Tokyo Bay]], accepted the surrender of [[United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka Naval Base]] and surrounding area from Vice Admiral [[Michitaro Totsuka]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], and attended the ceremony for the [[surrender of Japan]] held on board Halsey's flagship, the battleship {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}}.\n\n==Post war==\n[[File:ADM Carney, Robert B CNO OFF-P.jpg|thumb|right|Official portrait of Admiral Robert Carney as Chief of Naval Operations]]\nIn 1946, Carney was promoted to vice admiral and, until February 1950, served as [[Deputy Chief of Naval Operations]]. He then assumed command of the [[United States Second Fleet|Second Fleet]] operating on the East Coast of the United States. On October 2, 1950, Carney was advanced in rank to admiral.\n\nFrom 1951 to 1953, Carney served as Commander-in-Chief of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]]'s [[Allied Forces Southern Europe]], where he was responsible for the fleets of five countries and the armed forces of Italy, Greece and Turkey.\n\nOn May 13, 1953, President [[Dwight D.

Eisenhower|Eisenhower administration]].\n\n==Early years==\nBorn in [[Vallejo, California]], Carney graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 1916. He served in [[World War I]], seeing combat against German [[U-boat]]s.\n\n==Between wars==\nCarney served as Flag Secretary to Admiral [[Louis R. de Steiguer]] during the mid-1920s during de Steiguer's time in command of various battleship forces. Their relationship was not happy, mainly due to de Steiguer's imperious manner described by Carney as \"constant pressure, irascibility, criticism, and unpleasantness\".\n\nFamously, Carney eventually marched into de Steiguer's cabin, snapped, \"Admiral, I just want to tell you I think you are a goddamn rotten son of a bitch,\" and stormed out. After failing to retrieve Carney with a [[US Marines|Marine]] orderly, de Steiguer visited Carney's cabin in person, said, \"Sonny, you've been working too hard. You and I are going ashore\" after which he took Carney on an epic drinking binge. Carney ultimately concluded that his three years with de Steiguer had been a valuable experience, but not one he would have chosen to repeat.<ref>Taussig, Betty Carney (1995), A Warrior for Freedom, Manhattan, Kansas: Sunflower University Press, at 42\u201343</ref>\n\n==World War II==\nIn February 1941, then Commander Carney was recalled from duty in the Pacific to assist in organizing, equipping, and training a special Surface-Air Force, having as its mission the protection of shipping against [[submarine]] and air attack. This force became fully involved in convoy escort prior to the involvement of the United States into the war. From September 13, 1941,<ref name=\"proceedings\">Carney, Robert B., ADM USN \"Comment and Discussion\" ''United States Naval Institute Proceedings'' January 1976 p.74</ref> until April 1942, this force, under command of Vice Admiral [[Arthur L. Bristol, Jr.]], escorted over 2,600 ships on the ocean lanes while suffering the loss of only six ships.\n\nFrom October 15, 1942, until July 1943 Carney commanded the [[cruiser]] {{USS|Denver|CL-58|6}} in the Pacific Theater. He was twice decorated for engagements in the [[Solomon Islands]] campaign, earning the [[Bronze Star Medal]] with Combat \"V\" for meritorious service as Commanding Officer of ''Denver'' while attached to a task group of Admiral [[William Halsey]]'s [[United States Third Fleet|Third Fleet]] during operations against the Japanese-held Islands of [[Kolombangara]], [[Shortland Islands|Shortland]]. Off [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] the night of July 26, 1943 he took advantage of poor weather to lay a large quantity of mines along [[sea lane]]s around the island, and then delivered a naval bombardment against the Japanese shore installations.\n\nOn July 29, 1943, Carney was appointed [[Chief of Staff]] to Halsey, and was promoted to [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]]. At the time Halsey was Commander, [[South Pacific Force]], a responsibility which included all ground, sea, and air forces in the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] area. Carney later wrote that \"Admiral Halsey unfailingly gave credit to his subordinates for successes achieved, and took all blame for failures on his own shoulders.\" While in this assignment, Carney was awarded his second [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]] for his contributions to the overall strategy and in organizing the logistic support of the Allied Forces in the South Pacific, the citation stating, in part:\n{{quote|Displaying sound judgement and distinctive tactical ability, he conceived and correlated the many offensive operations carried out in the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Bismarck Archipelago]] areas. Through his comprehensive knowledge of [[logistics]] and his expert planning, he enabled our Forces to exert their greatest strength against the enemy and administer a series of crushing defeats on the Japanese.}}\n\nWhen Halsey assumed command of the Third Fleet in the Central Pacific in June 1944, Carney accompanied him as Chief of Staff. Carney participated in the amphibious invasions of [[Palau]] and [[Invasion of Lingayen Gulf|Lingayen]], and the naval [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]]. It was during this engagement that Carney famously confronted an enraged Halsey. During Halsey's run to the north in tracking down the Japanese carriers, he received numerous calls from Admiral [[Thomas C. Kinkaid]]'s Seventh Fleet, whose escort carriers were under attack from a Japanese battle group of battleships, cruisers and destroyers. Then, shortly after 10:00 hours, an anxious message was received from Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]]: \"Where is repeat where is Task Force 34? The world wonders\".<ref name=\"Willmott\">{{cite book |last=Willmott |first=H. P. |title=The Battle of Leyte Gulf: The Last Fleet Action |publisher=Indiana University Press |pages=192\u2013197 |chapter=Six, The Great Day of Wrath |isbn=9780253345288}}</ref> The tail end of this message, [[The world wonders]], was intended as padding designed to confuse enemy decoders, but was mistakenly left in the message when it was handed to Halsey. The inquiry appeared to be a rebuke. The fiery Halsey threw his hat on the deck of the bridge and began cursing. Finally Carney confronted him, telling Halsey \"Stop it! What the hell's the matter with you? Pull yourself together.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,793941,00.html#ixzz1aL8AA1Tz |title=Books: The General and the Admiral |work=Time |date=November 10, 1947}}</ref> Halsey regained his composure, and later turned the fleet south to support Seventh Fleet.\n\nLater, Carney continued to assist Halsey as Chief of Staff during his operations in the [[Okinawa]] campaign and the carrier air raids against Japanese air fields in Vietnam and [[Taiwan|Formosa]] in the [[South China Sea]]. In 1945, Third Fleet was striking targets in the Japanese homeland itself, launching attacks on Tokyo, the [[Bombing of Kure (July 1945)|naval base at Kure]] and the northern Japanese island of [[Hokkaid\u014d]], as well as the [[Allied naval bombardments of Japan during World War II|bombardments of a number of Japanese coastal cities]] in preparation for an invasion of Japan which never happened.\n\nCarney arranged with Japanese emissaries for the entry of the Third Fleet into [[Tokyo Bay]], accepted the surrender of [[United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka Naval Base]] and surrounding area from Vice Admiral [[Michitaro Totsuka]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], and attended the ceremony for the [[surrender of Japan]] held on board Halsey's flagship, the battleship {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}}.\n\n==Post war==\n[[File:ADM Carney, Robert B CNO OFF-P.jpg|thumb|right|Official portrait of Admiral Robert Carney as Chief of Naval Operations]]\nIn 1946, Carney was promoted to vice admiral and, until February 1950, served as [[Deputy Chief of Naval Operations]]. He then assumed command of the [[United States Second Fleet|Second Fleet]] operating on the East Coast of the United States. On October 2, 1950, Carney was advanced in rank to admiral.\n\nFrom 1951 to 1953, Carney served as Commander-in-Chief of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]]'s [[Allied Forces Southern Europe]], where he was responsible for the fleets of five countries and the armed forces of Italy, Greece and Turkey.\n\nOn May 13, 1953, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] selected Carney as the next [[Chief of Naval Operations]]. On completion of this assignment, Carney retired from active service in the Navy.\n\nOver the next several years, Carney's various assignments, coupled with his personal interest in industrial participation in the defense effort, resulted in close contact with industry including the position of Chairman of the Board, [[Bath Iron Works]], Corporation.\n\nCarney died of [[cardiac arrest]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on June 25, 1990, at the age of 95.

Founded in the 17th century as a plantation town, it now holds both local industry and commuter housing.\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\nVirginia was founded in the early 17th century,<ref>{{cite web|title=Virginia.ie - History of Virginia|url=http://www.virginia.ie/index.php?page=history-of-virginia}}</ref> at Aghanure ({{Irish place name|Achadh an I\u00fair|field of the yew}}),<ref name=logainm/> during the [[Plantation of Ulster]] and was named Virginia after [[Queen Elizabeth I of England]], the \"Virgin Queen.\"\n\nThe settlement was started where an English adventurer named John Ridgeway was granted [[the Crown]] patent in August 1612 to build a new town, situated upon the Great Road, approximately midway between the towns of [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]] and Cavan.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/plantationpaper00whiggoog/plantationpaper00whiggoog_djvu.txt Hill, George (Rev.), \"Plantation papers: containing a summary sketch of the great Ulster plantation in the year 1610\"]</ref> The chosen site was, according to tradition, where a ruined ''[[O'Reilly|\u00d3 Raghallaigh]]'' (O'Reilly) castle stood, and was then described as Aghaler, a location once set within the ancient [[Lurgan]] parish townland of Ballaghanea. The patented conditions of settlement were to introduce [[English people|English]] settlers to the area and build the town to incorporated [[borough]] status. Ridgeway had difficulty in attracting sufficient English tradespeople and settler families into what was then regarded as a hostile territory outside of the protection of [[the Pale]], so he only managed to build a few wooden cabins and a corn mill near to the castle. His new town was situated close to the shores of [[Lough Ramor]].\n\nRidgeway passed the patent on to another Englishman, [[Captain (British Army)|Captain]] Hugh Culme, who already possessed lands beside [[Lough Oughter]] in County Cavan and had access to building timber. Culme persuaded the Plantation Commission to move the location of Virginia to its present location close to the Blackwater tributary river, whereupon he built a number of cabins for the settlers but still failed to meet the Commissions time frame for developing the town further before giving up on the task, probably for the same reasons as his predecessor.\n\n===The Plunketts===\nDuring November 1622, the Virginia estate came into the possession of [[Luke Plunkett, 1st Earl of Fingall|the 10th Baron Killeen]] (who was created the 1st [[Earl of Fingall]] in 1628), who also held extensive lands around County Meath. Lord Killeen, who was a Catholic [[Anglo-Irish]] [[Peer of the realm|peer]] of [[Normans|Norman]] descent, whose family had come to Ireland in the twelfth century, undertook to complete the patented project.\nComplaints from the Virginia inhabitants about the lack of development progress reached the Commission by 1638 whereupon [[Christopher Plunkett, 2nd Earl of Fingall|The 2nd Earl of Fingall]] (who had succeeded his father in the [[earldom]] in 1637) was ordered to submit a substantial bond with the Commission's court, and to build the church in Virginia or face forfeiture of his County Cavan lands. The Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]], [[William Bedell]], undertook to lay out the town in accordance with the Commission requirement. However, events which led to the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] and [[Irish Confederate Wars]] enveloped Virginia causing widespread destruction and de-population. The summer of 1642 saw the outright destruction by government forces of the castle along with the burning of stocks of hay, corn and turf in a bid to punish the outlawed [[Christopher Plunkett, 2nd Earl of Fingall|Lord Fingall]] for his role in the [[Siege of Drogheda (1641)]].\n\nWhat remained of Virginia after the wars can be assessed through [[hearth tax]] records from the 1660s, indicating a small resident community. During the following century estate surveys were undertaken for the absentee landlord (exiled since the Williamite wars of 1688-91) which tell of a wayside Inn that existed since the earliest times (exact location unknown), operated then in 1727 by a Cornelius Donnellan and was frequented around that time by [[Jonathan Swift]] during his several excursions to Co. Cavan.\n\n===The Taylours===\nThe Virginia estate was eventually sold around the year 1750, on behalf of the Plunketts, to pay off mounting debts, with a new landlord family, the Taylors (later spelled as Taylour), taking over.  Virginia and its surrounding estate was particularly developed by [[Thomas Taylour, 1st Earl of Bective|Thomas Taylor]] (1724-1795), who built up the town and succeeded where others had failed. Taylor (who changed the spelling of the family surname to Taylour) succeeded his father in the [[baronetcy]] in 1757. The then Sir Thomas Taylour, 3rd [[Baronet|Bt.]], was created 1st [[Baron Headfort]] in 1760, and 1st [[Viscount Headfort]] in 1762. Lord Headfort was further advanced in the [[Peerage of Ireland|peerage]] to become The 1st [[Earl of Bective]] in 1766. It is recorded that [[Thomas Taylour, 1st Earl of Bective|Lord Bective]]'s great-grandfather, also a Thomas Taylor, was a [[cartographer]] who assisted [[Sir William Petty]] with the [[Down Survey]] during the previous century.\n\nThe Taylor (later Taylour) family had built a substantial mansion, [[Headfort House]] (now a school), beside [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]] in the north of [[County Meath]]. The family (who were granted the title [[Marquess of Headfort|Marquis of Headfort]] in 1800) now turned their attention to making the unproductive lands around Virginia into profitable farms through land drainage and afforestation of low-lying areas, resulting also in increases in rent paid by the farm tenants. While this in itself was not unique among Irish landlords, an acre of land at twenty old pennies (20>240) became fifteen shillings (180>240) per acre before the end of the century with a premium paid by flax growers. The results of which brought employment and management to the Headfort estates and quickly led to the setting up of markets and fairs in Virginia where local produce including flax yarn and linen was traded on the streets. Virginia's population doubled  between the census years of 1821 to 1841, and there was rapid construction in the town, leading to the Main Street as it is seen today. Successive [[Marquess of Headfort|Marquesses of Headfort]] created their own private demesne and a hunting lodge (now Park Hotel) overlooking Lough Ramor.\n\n===Famine and emigration===\nThe [[Great Hunger]], caused by successive failures in the potato crop, brought with it extreme hardship for the poorer classes, with death due to diseases like [[typhus]] and [[cholera]], prevalent due to poor sanitation, contaminated drinking water and other poor living conditions. Starvation, which impacted many parts of the country, was averted in Virginia due to the efforts of the local Famine Relief Committee, who made extra rations of Indian meal available in return for hard labour, this included women and children breaking stones for making roads and the building of the local Catholic church which took place during 1845 on lands donated by the landlord.\n\nIn subsequent years Virginia prospered with the introduction of a butter market in 1856, followed by the opening of the [[Great Northern Railway (Ireland)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR) line between Kells and [[Oldcastle, County Meath|Oldcastle]] in March 1863. Cattle and livestock could then be moved for export, however this also meant that produce such as coal and beer could be transported from the larger towns into rural areas which led to the closure of the local malt brewery and several bakeries in the town.\n\nPerhaps the most famous (and controversial) Virginia emigrant was [[General (United States)|General]] [[Philip H. Sheridan]] (1831-1888), whose parents came from nearby [[Killinkere]], left Ireland around 1830 and settled in America. Sheridan achieved success, and notoriety, through a military career, particularly during the [[American Civil War]]. President Lincoln stated, \"this Sheridan is a little Irishman, but a big fighter\", eventually became commanding General of the US Army and had many honours bestowed upon him.\n\nThe closure of the Virginia Roads railway station, and GNR line, in 1958, came about as Ireland's population fell to its lowest levels - the 1951 census lists Virginia with a population of just 297 persons.\n\n===Modern development===\n\nIn 1975, US President [[Gerald Ford]] visited Virginia upon hearing that the local petrol station did nice 99s. Upon arriving, he declared it to be a bit of a kip, and promptly decided to take on [[Bob Dole]] as his running mate for the 1976 election out of pure trauma.\n\n\nIn 2007 the local Development Association submitted a proposal to have a new Regional Hospital built near Virginia, on a site owned by [[Cavan County Council]]. Although widely supported by the community and the region's political representatives, the bid was abandoned with a government announcement that there was not a 'red penny' available for such a project. Road transport links to Virginia have seen some improvement since the opening during 2010 of the M3 motorway linking Virginia to Dublin. This has led to a continued rise in local developments, with many new houses and commercial business being built.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Virginia Cavan.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|Virginia by Lough Ramor]]\nThe town is situated close to [[Lough Ramor]], one of the larger lakes in County Cavan, stretching approximately 7&nbsp;km in length by 1&nbsp;km at the narrowest point, and feeding into the Blackwater and Boyne river systems.<ref>{{cite web|title=The size and length of Lough Ramor and what rivers it feeds in to|url=http://virginia.ie/index.php?page=about-virginia}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\nVirginia is on the [[N3 road (Ireland)|N3 route]] approximately 85&nbsp;km northwest of [[Dublin]], and was once a staging and rest point for the coaches plying between [[Enniskillen]] and Dublin.

Founded in the 17th century as a plantation town, it now holds both local industry and commuter housing.\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\nVirginia was founded in the early 17th century,<ref>{{cite web|title=Virginia.ie - History of Virginia|url=http://www.virginia.ie/index.php?page=history-of-virginia}}</ref> at Aghanure ({{Irish place name|Achadh an I\u00fair|field of the yew}}),<ref name=logainm/> during the [[Plantation of Ulster]] and was named Virginia after [[Queen Elizabeth I of England]], the \"Virgin Queen.\"\n\nThe settlement was started where an English adventurer named John Ridgeway was granted [[the Crown]] patent in August 1612 to build a new town, situated upon the Great Road, approximately midway between the towns of [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]] and Cavan.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/plantationpaper00whiggoog/plantationpaper00whiggoog_djvu.txt Hill, George (Rev.), \"Plantation papers: containing a summary sketch of the great Ulster plantation in the year 1610\"]</ref> The chosen site was, according to tradition, where a ruined ''[[O'Reilly|\u00d3 Raghallaigh]]'' (O'Reilly) castle stood, and was then described as Aghaler, a location once set within the ancient [[Lurgan]] parish townland of Ballaghanea. The patented conditions of settlement were to introduce [[English people|English]] settlers to the area and build the town to incorporated [[borough]] status. Ridgeway had difficulty in attracting sufficient English tradespeople and settler families into what was then regarded as a hostile territory outside of the protection of [[the Pale]], so he only managed to build a few wooden cabins and a corn mill near to the castle. His new town was situated close to the shores of [[Lough Ramor]].\n\nRidgeway passed the patent on to another Englishman, [[Captain (British Army)|Captain]] Hugh Culme, who already possessed lands beside [[Lough Oughter]] in County Cavan and had access to building timber. Culme persuaded the Plantation Commission to move the location of Virginia to its present location close to the Blackwater tributary river, whereupon he built a number of cabins for the settlers but still failed to meet the Commissions time frame for developing the town further before giving up on the task, probably for the same reasons as his predecessor.\n\n===The Plunketts===\nDuring November 1622, the Virginia estate came into the possession of [[Luke Plunkett, 1st Earl of Fingall|The 10th Baron Killeen]] (who was created The 1st [[Earl of Fingall]] in 1628), who also held extensive lands around County Meath. Lord Killeen, who was a Catholic [[Anglo-Irish]] [[Peer of the realm|peer]] of [[Normans|Norman]] descent, whose family had come to Ireland in the twelfth century, undertook to complete the patented project.\nComplaints from the Virginia inhabitants about the lack of development progress reached the Commission by 1638 whereupon [[Christopher Plunkett, 2nd Earl of Fingall|The 2nd Earl of Fingall]] (who had succeeded his father in the [[earldom]] in 1637) was ordered to submit a substantial bond with the Commission's court, and to build the church in Virginia or face forfeiture of his County Cavan lands. The Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]], [[William Bedell]], undertook to lay out the town in accordance with the Commission requirement. However, events which led to the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] and [[Irish Confederate Wars]] enveloped Virginia causing widespread destruction and de-population. The summer of 1642 saw the outright destruction by government forces of the castle along with the burning of stocks of hay, corn and turf in a bid to punish the outlawed [[Christopher Plunkett, 2nd Earl of Fingall|Lord Fingall]] for his role in the [[Siege of Drogheda (1641)]].\n\nWhat remained of Virginia after the wars can be assessed through [[hearth tax]] records from the 1660s, indicating a small resident community. During the following century estate surveys were undertaken for the absentee landlord (exiled since the Williamite wars of 1688-91) which tell of a wayside Inn that existed since the earliest times (exact location unknown), operated then in 1727 by a Cornelius Donnellan and was frequented around that time by [[Jonathan Swift]] during his several excursions to Co. Cavan.\n\n===The Taylours===\nThe Virginia estate was eventually sold around the year 1750, on behalf of the Plunketts, to pay off mounting debts, with a new landlord family, the Taylors (later spelled as Taylour), taking over.  Virginia and its surrounding estate was particularly developed by [[Thomas Taylour, 1st Earl of Bective|Thomas Taylor]] (1724-1795), who built up the town and succeeded where others had failed. Taylor (who changed the spelling of the family surname to Taylour) succeeded his father in the [[baronetcy]] in 1757. The then Sir Thomas Taylour, 3rd [[Baronet|Bt.]], was created 1st [[Baron Headfort]] in 1760, and 1st [[Viscount Headfort]] in 1762. Lord Headfort was further advanced in the [[Peerage of Ireland|peerage]] to become The 1st [[Earl of Bective]] in 1766. It is recorded that [[Thomas Taylour, 1st Earl of Bective|Lord Bective]]'s great-grandfather, also a Thomas Taylor, was a [[cartographer]] who assisted [[Sir William Petty]] with the [[Down Survey]] during the previous century.\n\nThe Taylor (later Taylour) family had built a substantial mansion, [[Headfort House]] (now a school), beside [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]] in the north of [[County Meath]]. The family (who were granted the title [[Marquess of Headfort|Marquis of Headfort]] in 1800) now turned their attention to making the unproductive lands around Virginia into profitable farms through land drainage and afforestation of low-lying areas, resulting also in increases in rent paid by the farm tenants. While this in itself was not unique among Irish landlords, an acre of land at twenty old pennies (20>240) became fifteen shillings (180>240) per acre before the end of the century with a premium paid by flax growers.

Today they are used chiefly for purposes of local administration and electoral constituency.\n\nThe [[Conn\u00e9table (Jersey and Guernsey)|Conn\u00e9table]] is the head of each parish, elected at a public election for a four-year term to run the parish and to represent the municipality in the [[States of Jersey|States Assembly]]. The [[Procureur du Bien Public]] (two in each parish) is the legal and financial representative of the parish (elected at a public election since 2003 in accordance with the ''Public Elections (Amendment) (Jersey) Law 2003''; formerly an Assembly of Electors of each parish elected the Procureurs in accordance with the ''Loi (1804) au sujet des assembl\u00e9es paroissiales''). A Procureur du Bien Public is elected for three years as a public trustee for the funds and property of the parish and may contract when authorised by a Parish Assembly. The [[Parish Assembly (Jersey)|Parish Assembly]] is the decision-making body of local government in each parish; it consists of all entitled voters of the parish.\n\nEach parish elects its own force of [[Honorary Police]] consisting of ''[[Centenier]]s'', ''[[Vingtenier]]s'' and [[Constable's Officer]]s. Centeniers are elected at a public election within each parish for a term of three years to undertake policing within the parish. The Centenier is the only officer authorised to charge and bail offenders. Formerly, the senior Centenier of each parish (entitled the ''Chef de Police'') deputised for the Conn\u00e9table in the States of Jersey when the Conn\u00e9table was unable to attend a sitting of the States.

Jersey maintains the ''Bureau des Iles Anglo-Normandes'' in [[Caen]], France, a permanent non-diplomatic representation.

It did, however, have a relationship with the EU governed by article 335(5)(c) TFEU giving effect to Protocol 3 to the UK's Treaty of Accession in 1972.<ref>[[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], Article 355(5)(c) TFEU states \"the Treaties shall apply to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man only to the extent necessary to ensure the implementation of the arrangements for those islands set out in the Treaty concerning the accession of new Member States to the European Economic Community and to the European Atomic Energy Community signed on 22 January 1972\".</ref> However, Jersey did not appear on the list of European States and Territories outside the Union and the Communities prepared by the European Council and the Commission. This is a result of the manner of implementation of the Treaty arrangements under the Act of Accession in 1972. Jersey would have been fully within the European Communities like [[Gibraltar]], being a European territory for whose external relations the United Kingdom was responsible, but that was limited to the Protocol 3 arrangements under article 355 TFEU to reflect the then existing relationship with the United Kingdom.\n\nUnder Protocol 3, Jersey was part of the [[European Union Customs Union]] of the [[European Community]]. The common customs tariff, levies and other agricultural import measures apply to trade between the island and non-Member States. There is [[Internal Market (European Union)#Free movement of goods|free movement of goods]] and trade between the island and [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]]. EU rules on [[freedom of movement for workers]] do not apply in Jersey.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61996J0171:EN:HTML |title='&#39;Rui Alberto Pereira Roque v His Excellency the Lieutenant Governor of Jersey'&#39;, Case C-171/96 (European Court of Justice) |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |access-date=12 September 2013}}</ref> However, Article 4 of the Protocol required the island's authorities to give the same treatment to all natural and legal persons of the Communities. In Pereira, the ECJ held that the scope of this article included any matter governed by the Treaties in a territory where the Treaties are fully applicable. The island was therefore within the scope of the Treaties to a limited extent, as a European Territory. To infer, as the French Ambassador and finance minister had attempted to argue, namely that the island is outside the European Union and Communities without qualification is therefore simplistic, in law false. The German blacklisting of the island had to be hastily revoked when this was pointed out. As a result, Jersey was not part of the single market in [[Markets in Financial Instruments Directive|financial services]]. It was not required to implement EU Directives on such matters as the movement of capital, company law or money laundering. However, the island's close proximity (135&nbsp;km south) and its close association with the financial sector of the U.K. has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with several mainline publications (e.g., ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'') labelling the island a [[tax haven]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sesit |first=M |title=Offshore Hazard: Isle of Jersey Proves Less Than a Haven to Currency Investors |date=17 September 1996 |agency=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>\n\nBritish citizens who have only a connection to Jersey, and not with the United Kingdom or another member state of the European Union, were not considered by the Jersey States to be [[Citizenship of the European Union|European Union citizens]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/AssemblyReports/2008/45051-30164-1222008.pdf |title=Status of Channel Islands in the European Union |last=States of Jersey |date=4 February 2008 |access-date=20 December 2011}}</ref> They have 'Islander status' and their Jersey-issued [[Jersey passport|British passports]] are endorsed with the words ''the holder is not entitled to benefit from EU provisions relating to employment or establishment''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gov.je/Travel/Passports/OtherInfo/Pages/IslanderStatus.aspx |title=Islander status |last=States of Jersey |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107062741/http://www.gov.je/Travel/Passports/OtherInfo/Pages/IslanderStatus.aspx |archive-date=7 November 2011 |access-date=23 August 2011}}</ref> This will continue until the end of the Brexit transition period.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gov.je:80/Travel/Passports/GetAPassport/Pages/ApplyForYourFirstAdultPassport.aspx |title=Government of Jersey |last=Jersey |first=States of |website=gov.je |language=en |access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\nHowever, it is not yet clear whether the citizenship rights in articles 18 and 21 TFEU are partly available to them as British Citizens, given the limited restriction of their rights under article 2 of the Protocol. That restriction on the exercise of certain freedoms did not apply to all Community or Union rights. The freedom of movement under the prior EC r\u00e9gime was and remains a separate set of rights from the Citizen rights under article 20 and 21 TFEU which include the right to move and reside. Those rights are primary citizenship rights, not a mere freedom. It might not need a Treaty change to perfect this, merely a preliminary ruling from the CJEU, and supplementary implementation measures from the Council, given the effective right of entrance and residence granted to EU nationals via Article 4 of the Protocol. Jersey residents did not have a right to vote in elections for the [[European Parliament]]. Jersey and Guernsey jointly opened an office in [[Brussels]] in 2010 to promote their common interests with European Union institutions.<ref>{{Citation |title=Channel Islands appoint representative in Brussels |date=25 January 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-12276525 |work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nThe effect of the UK leaving the European Union is uncertain.

The highest temperature recorded was 36.0&nbsp;\u00b0C (96.8&nbsp;\u00b0F) on 9 August 2003 and again on 23 July 2019<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ogimet.com/cgi-bin/gsynres?lang=en&ind=03895&ano=2019&mes=7&day=24&hora=5&min=0&ndays=30 |title=Synop report summary |website=www.ogimet.com |access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref>, and the lowest temperature recorded was \u221210.3&nbsp;\u00b0C (13.5&nbsp;\u00b0F) on 5 January 1894. By comparison, higher temperatures are found in mainland United Kingdom, which achieved 38.5&nbsp;\u00b0C (101.3&nbsp;\u00b0F) in [[Faversham]], [[Kent]] on 10 August 2003. The impact of the Atlantic Ocean and coastal winds ensure that Jersey is slightly cooler than the southern and central parts of [[England]] during the summer months.\nSnow falls rarely in Jersey; some years will pass with no snow fall at all.\n\nThe terrain consists of a [[plateau]] sloping from long sandy bays in the south to rugged cliffs in the north.

The island is recognised as one of the [[Offshore Financial Centre#List of main offshore financial centres|leading offshore financial centres]].

The levying of ''imp\u00f4ts'' (duties) different from those of the United Kingdom was granted by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and remained in the hands of the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats until 1921 when that body's tax raising powers were transferred to the Assembly of the States, leaving the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats to serve simply as licensing bench for the sale of alcohol (this fiscal reform also stripped the Lieutenant-Governor of most of his effective remaining administrative functions). The Income Tax Law of 1928 introducing [[income tax]] was the first law drafted entirely in English. Income tax has been levied at a [[Flat tax|flat rate]] of 20% set by the occupying Germans during the Second World War.\n\nBecause [[value added tax]] (VAT) has not been levied in the island, luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, providing an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led to the growth of the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the Government of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. [[Low-value consignment relief]] provided the mechanism for [[VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands]] to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was binned.\n\nAlthough Jersey does not have VAT, the Government of Jersey introduced a [[Value added tax|goods and services tax]] (GST) on 6 May 2008, at a standard rate of 3%. The rate was amended to 5% on 1 June 2011. Although GST is at 5%, shopping in Jersey is still far more expensive than in the UK. Food is not exempt, unlike with VAT.\n\nJersey is not subject to European Union fiscal legislation, and its \"Zero/Ten\" corporate tax legislation will be compliant with the Code of Conduct in business taxation as from the removal of the deemed distribution and attribution anti-avoidance legislation {{as of|2011|December|31|lc=y}}, which was apparently criticised by certain unnamed members of the Code of Conduct Group, a subsidiary body of [[ECOFIN]]. The Code of Conduct Group,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/company_tax/harmful_tax_practices/index_en.htm |title=Harmful tax competition \u2013 Taxation and Customs Union \u2013 European Commission |website=Taxation and Customs Union}}</ref> at least in theory, keeps most of its documentation and discussion confidential. The [[European Commission]] has confirmed that the Code is not a legal instrument, and therefore is not legally binding, only becoming of limited \"political\" authority once a unanimous report has been adopted by the Group at the end of the Presidency concerned.\n\nJersey is considered to be a [[tax haven]] by some organisations - for example the [[Financial Secrecy Index]] ranks Jersey as 18th {{as of|2018|lc=y}}.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/introduction/fsi-2018-results |title=View 2018 Results |website=www.financialsecrecyindex.com |access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref> Jersey does not feature, however, in the March 2019 revised EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?qid=1553511630251&uri=CELEX:52019XG0326(01) |title=EUR-Lex - 52019XG0326(01) - EN - EUR-Lex |website=eur-lex.europa.eu |access-date=2019-05-02}}</ref>\n\n===Currency===\n[[File:Dual currency cash machines in Jersey.jpg|thumb|Twin [[Automatic teller machine|cash machines]] at a bank that dispensed a choice of [[Bank of England]] or Jersey banknotes.

Following [[Napol\u00e9on III|Louis Napol\u00e9on]]'s coup of 1851, more French ''[[exile|proscrit]]s'' arrived. By the end of the 19th century, well-to-do British families, attracted by the lack of income tax, were settling in Jersey in increasing numbers, establishing St Helier as a predominantly English-speaking town.\n\nSeasonal work in agriculture had depended mostly on [[Breton people|Bretons]] and mainland Normans from the 19th century. The growth of tourism attracted staff from the United Kingdom. Following [[End of World War II in Europe|liberation]] in 1945, agricultural workers were mostly recruited from the United Kingdom \u2013 the demands of reconstruction in mainland [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]] employed domestic labour.\n\nUntil the 1960s, the population had been relatively stable for decades at around 60,000 (excluding the Occupation years). Economic growth spurred immigration and a rise in population, which is, by 2013, about 100,000. From the 1960s [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] workers arrived, mostly working initially in seasonal industries in agriculture and tourism.\n\nImmigration has helped give aspects of Jersey a distinct urban character, particularly in and around the parish of St Helier, which contributes much to ongoing debates between development and sustainability throughout the island.<ref>Johnson, Henry (2016) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306058256_Encountering_Urbanization_on_Jersey_Development_Sustainability_and_Spatiality_in_a_Small_Island_Setting Encountering Urbanization on Jersey: Development, Sustainability, and Spatiality in a Small Island Setting].

In 2015, Jersey's first ever national survey of religion found that two fifths of Jersey people have [[irreligion|no religion]], with only small handfuls of Jersey people belonging to the non-Christian religions. In total, 54% said they had some form of religion, and 7% were not sure. Of those that specified a denomination of Christianity, equal proportions were 'Catholic' or 'Roman Catholic' (43%) as were 'Anglican' or 'Church of England' (44%).

In the countryside, [[Methodism]] found its traditional stronghold. A substantial minority of [[Catholic Church in Jersey|Roman Catholics]] can also be found in Jersey. There are two Catholic private combined primary and secondary schools: [[De La Salle College, Jersey|De La Salle College]] in [[Saint Saviour, Jersey|Saint Saviour]] is an all-boys school, and Beaulieu Convent School in Saint Saviour is an all-girls school; and [[Faithful Companions of Jesus|FCJ]] primary school in St. Saviour.

There have been efforts to revive J\u00e8rriais in schools, and the highest number of declared J\u00e8rriais speakers is in the capital.\n\n[[File:Lillie langtry.JPG|thumb|upright|Actress [[Lillie Langtry]], nicknamed the ''Jersey Lily''.]]\nThe [[dialect]]s of J\u00e8rriais differ in [[phonology]] and, to a lesser extent, [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] between parishes, with the most marked differences to be heard between those of the west and east. Many place names are in J\u00e8rriais, and French and English place names are also to be found. [[Anglicisation]] of the [[place names]] increased apace with the migration of English people to the island.\n\nSome [[Neolithic]] carvings are the earliest works of artistic character to be found in Jersey.

''(See [[Channel Island milk]])'' However, there is no indigenous tradition of cheese making, contrary to the custom of mainland Normandy, but some cheese is produced commercially. Jersey [[fudge]], mostly imported and made with milk from overseas Jersey cattle herds, is a popular food product with tourists.\n\n[[Jersey Royal potatoes]] are the local variety of [[new potato]], and the island is famous for its early crop of Chats (small potatoes) from the south-facing c\u00f4tils (steeply sloping fields). They were originally grown using [[Seaweed fertiliser|vraic]] as a natural fertiliser giving them their own individual taste, only a small portion of those grown in the island still use this method. They are eaten in a variety of ways, often simply boiled and served with butter or when not as fresh fried in butter.\n\nApples historically were an important crop. ''Bourd\u00e9lots'' are apple dumplings, but the most typical speciality is black butter (''[[Ni\u00e8r beurre|l\u00e9 ni\u00e8r beurre]]''), a dark spicy spread prepared from apples, cider and spices. [[Cider]] used to be an important export. After decline and near-disappearance in the late 20th century, apple production is being increased and promoted. Besides cider, [[apple brandy]] is produced.

It did, however, have a relationship with the EU governed by article 335(5)(c) TFEU giving effect to Protocol 3 to the UK's Treaty of Accession in 1972.<ref>[[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], Article 355(5)(c) TFEU states \"the Treaties shall apply to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man only to the extent necessary to ensure the implementation of the arrangements for those islands set out in the Treaty concerning the accession of new Member States to the European Economic Community and to the European Atomic Energy Community signed on 22 January 1972\".</ref> However, Jersey did not appear on the list of European States and Territories outside the Union and the Communities prepared by the European Council and the Commission. This is a result of the manner of implementation of the Treaty arrangements under the Act of Accession in 1972. Jersey would have been fully within the European Communities like [[Gibraltar]], being a European territory for whose external relations the United Kingdom was responsible, but that was limited to the Protocol 3 arrangements under article 355 TFEU to reflect the then existing relationship with the United Kingdom.\n\nUnder Protocol 3, Jersey was part of the [[European Union Customs Union]] of the [[European Community]]. The common customs tariff, levies and other agricultural import measures apply to trade between the island and non-Member States. There is [[Internal Market (European Union)#Free movement of goods|free movement of goods]] and trade between the island and [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]]. EU rules on [[freedom of movement for workers]] do not apply in Jersey.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61996J0171:EN:HTML |title='&#39;Rui Alberto Pereira Roque v His Excellency the Lieutenant Governor of Jersey'&#39;, Case C-171/96 (European Court of Justice) |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |access-date=12 September 2013}}</ref> However, Article 4 of the Protocol required the island's authorities to give the same treatment to all natural and legal persons of the Communities. In Pereira, the ECJ held that the scope of this article included any matter governed by the Treaties in a territory where the Treaties are fully applicable. The island was therefore within the scope of the Treaties to a limited extent, as a European Territory. To infer, as the French Ambassador and finance minister had attempted to argue, namely that the island is outside the European Union and Communities without qualification is therefore simplistic, in law false. The German blacklisting of the island had to be hastily revoked when this was pointed out. As a result, Jersey was not part of the single market in [[Markets in Financial Instruments Directive|financial services]]. It was not required to implement EU Directives on such matters as the movement of capital, company law or money laundering. However, the island's close proximity (135&nbsp;km south) and its close association with the financial sector of the U.K. has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with several mainline publications (e.g., ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'') labelling the island a [[tax haven]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sesit |first=M |title=Offshore Hazard: Isle of Jersey Proves Less Than a Haven to Currency Investors |date=17 September 1996 |agency=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>\n\nBritish citizens who have only a connection to Jersey, and not with the United Kingdom or another member state of the European Union, were not considered by the Jersey States to be [[Citizenship of the European Union|European Union citizens]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/AssemblyReports/2008/45051-30164-1222008.pdf |title=Status of Channel Islands in the European Union |last=States of Jersey |date=4 February 2008 |access-date=20 December 2011}}</ref> They have 'Islander status' and their Jersey-issued [[Jersey passport|British passports]] are endorsed with the words ''the holder is not entitled to benefit from EU provisions relating to employment or establishment''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gov.je/Travel/Passports/OtherInfo/Pages/IslanderStatus.aspx |title=Islander status |last=States of Jersey |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107062741/http://www.gov.je/Travel/Passports/OtherInfo/Pages/IslanderStatus.aspx |archive-date=7 November 2011 |access-date=23 August 2011}}</ref> This will continue until the end of the Brexit transition period.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gov.je:80/Travel/Passports/GetAPassport/Pages/ApplyForYourFirstAdultPassport.aspx |title=Government of Jersey |last=Jersey |first=States of |website=gov.je |language=en |access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\nHowever, it is not yet clear whether the citizenship rights in articles 18 and 21 TFEU are partly available to them as British Citizens, given the limited restriction of their rights under article 2 of the Protocol. That restriction on the exercise of certain freedoms did not apply to all Community or Union rights. The freedom of movement under the prior EC r\u00e9gime was and remains a separate set of rights from the Citizen rights under article 20 and 21 TFEU which include the right to move and reside. Those rights are primary citizenship rights, not a mere freedom. It might not need a Treaty change to perfect this, merely a preliminary ruling from the CJEU, and supplementary implementation measures from the Council, given the effective right of entrance and residence granted to EU nationals via Article 4 of the Protocol. Jersey residents did not have a right to vote in elections for the [[European Parliament]].

The levying of ''imp\u00f4ts'' (duties) different from those of the United Kingdom was granted by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and remained in the hands of the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats until 1921 when that body's tax raising powers were transferred to the Assembly of the States, leaving the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats to serve simply as licensing bench for the sale of alcohol (this fiscal reform also stripped the Lieutenant-Governor of most of his effective remaining administrative functions). The Income Tax Law of 1928 introducing [[income tax]] was the first law drafted entirely in English. Income tax has been levied at a [[Flat tax|flat rate]] of 20% set by the occupying Germans during the Second World War.\n\nBecause [[value added tax]] (VAT) has not been levied in the island, luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, providing an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led to the growth of the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the Government of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. [[Low-value consignment relief]] provided the mechanism for [[VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands]] to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was binned.\n\nAlthough Jersey does not have VAT, the Government of Jersey introduced a [[Value added tax|goods and services tax]] (GST) on 6 May 2008, at a standard rate of 3%. The rate was amended to 5% on 1 June 2011. Although GST is at 5%, shopping in Jersey is still far more expensive than in the UK.

By the end of the 19th century, well-to-do British families, attracted by the lack of income tax, were settling in Jersey in increasing numbers, establishing St Helier as a predominantly English-speaking town.\n\nSeasonal work in agriculture had depended mostly on [[Breton people|Bretons]] and mainland Normans from the 19th century. The growth of tourism attracted staff from the United Kingdom. Following [[End of World War II in Europe|liberation]] in 1945, agricultural workers were mostly recruited from the United Kingdom \u2013 the demands of reconstruction in mainland [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]] employed domestic labour.\n\nUntil the 1960s, the population had been relatively stable for decades at around 60,000 (excluding the Occupation years). Economic growth spurred immigration and a rise in population, which is, by 2013, about 100,000. From the 1960s [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] workers arrived, mostly working initially in seasonal industries in agriculture and tourism.\n\nImmigration has helped give aspects of Jersey a distinct urban character, particularly in and around the parish of St Helier, which contributes much to ongoing debates between development and sustainability throughout the island.<ref>Johnson, Henry (2016) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306058256_Encountering_Urbanization_on_Jersey_Development_Sustainability_and_Spatiality_in_a_Small_Island_Setting Encountering Urbanization on Jersey: Development, Sustainability, and Spatiality in a Small Island Setting].

''(See [[Channel Island milk]])'' However, there is no indigenous tradition of cheese making, contrary to the custom of mainland Normandy, but some cheese is produced commercially. Jersey [[fudge]], mostly imported and made with milk from overseas Jersey cattle herds, is a popular food product with tourists.\n\n[[Jersey Royal potatoes]] are the local variety of [[new potato]], and the island is famous for its early crop of Chats (small potatoes) from the south-facing c\u00f4tils (steeply sloping fields). They were originally grown using [[Seaweed fertiliser|vraic]] as a natural fertiliser giving them their own individual taste, only a small portion of those grown in the island still use this method. They are eaten in a variety of ways, often simply boiled and served with butter or when not as fresh fried in butter.\n\nApples historically were an important crop.

The first J\u00e8rriais book to be published was ''Rimes et Po\u00e9sies Jersiaises de divers auteurs r\u00e9unies et mises en ordre'', edited by Abraham Mourant in 1865. Writers born in Jersey include [[Elinor Glyn]], [[John Lempri\u00e8re]], [[Philippe Le Sueur Mourant]], [[Robert Pipon Marett]] and [[Augustus Asplet Le Gros]].

As well as offering part-time and evening courses, Highlands is also a [[sixth form]] provider, working alongside [[Hautlieu School]] which offers the only non-fee-paying sixth form, and works collaboratively with a range of organisations including the [[Open University]], [[University of Plymouth]] and [[London South Bank University]]. In particular students can study at Highlands for the two-year foundation degree in financial services and for a BSc in social sciences, both validated by the [[University of Plymouth]].\n\nThe Institute of Law is Jersey's [[law school]], providing a course for students seeking to qualify as Jersey advocates and solicitors.

It was a weekly program presented by [[Television Broadcasts Limited]] (TVB) and broadcast on [[TVB Jade]] in three series from February 2005 to August 2007. The show is intended to be [[satire|satirical]] and funny, since most of the contestants are inexperienced and are trying to get famous.\n\nThe show was hosted by [[Hacken Lee]] and [[Joey Leung]] in the first two seasons, who both acted as two of its judges. They were replaced by [[Miriam Yeung]] and [[Sammy Leung]] for the third season. All three seasons featured one or more guest judges in each episode, which varies between episodes.\n\n==Background==\nInspired by the ''[[Idols (TV series)|Idols]]'' franchise, the show gives ordinary [[Hongkongers]] the opportunity to appear as contestants on stage to sing and perform. Its slogan is \"\u5168\u57ce\u76e1\u8208\uff0c\u6b98\u9177\u4e00\u53ee\uff01\" (The whole city (Hong Kong) gets excited for the minutes to fame). The show has received top ratings, and the finals of the first series, on 4 June 2005, reached 33 points on the charts. It has led to the creation of several spinoffs by other Chinese television stations, including [[Asia TV]] and [[Guangdong Television]], and to collaboration with other [[mainland Chinese]] television stations to provide contestants for their own shows, such as [[CCTV]]'s [[China Dream]] Show.\n\nThe program was among TVB's first to recruit competitors from [[Overseas Chinese|overseas]]. Starting from May 2005, primaries are not only held in Hong Kong, but also in [[Guangzhou]], [[Macau]], [[Toronto]], [[Taipei]], [[Shanghai]], [[Singapore]], [[Sydney]] etc. Similarly, the European branch of TVB, TVB-S Europe, held a Minutes to Fame contest in [[Paris]] and [[Rotterdam]] on August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2005 respectively. The winner of both contests would proceed in a Minutes to Fame special later that year, where contestants from all over the world would compete.\n\n==Format==\nEach episode features a number of contestants whose objective is to remain on stage for as long as possible. Their act must involve singing one of eight randomly selected songs for each episode, which includes [[Cantopop]], [[Mandopop]], and even English-language [[popular music]].

It was a weekly program presented by [[Television Broadcasts Limited]] (TVB) and broadcast on [[TVB Jade]] in three series from February 2005 to August 2007. The show is intended to be [[satire|satirical]] and funny, since most of the contestants are inexperienced and are trying to get famous.\n\nThe show was hosted by [[Hacken Lee]] and [[Joey Leung]] in the first two seasons, who both acted as two of its judges. They were replaced by [[Miriam Yeung]] and [[Sammy Leung]] for the third season. All three seasons featured one or more guest judges in each episode, which varies between episodes.\n\n==Background==\nInspired by the ''[[Idols (TV series)|Idols]]'' franchise, the show gives ordinary [[Hongkongers]] the opportunity to appear as contestants on stage to sing and perform. Its slogan is \"\u5168\u57ce\u76e1\u8208\uff0c\u6b98\u9177\u4e00\u53ee\uff01\" (The whole city (Hong Kong) gets excited for the minutes to fame). The show has received top ratings, and the finals of the first series, on 4 June 2005, reached 33 points on the charts. It has led to the creation of several spinoffs by other Chinese television stations, including [[Asia TV]] and [[Guangdong Television]], and to collaboration with other [[mainland Chinese]] television stations to provide contestants for their own shows, such as [[CCTV]]'s [[China Dream]] Show.\n\nThe program was among TVB's first to recruit competitors from [[Overseas Chinese|overseas]]. Starting from May 2005, primaries are not only held in Hong Kong, but also in [[Guangzhou]], [[Macau]], [[Toronto]], [[Taipei]], [[Shanghai]], [[Singapore]], [[Sydney]] etc. Similarly, the European branch of TVB, TVB-S Europe, held a Minutes to Fame contest in [[Paris]] and [[Rotterdam]] on August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2005 respectively. The winner of both contests would proceed in a Minutes to Fame special later that year, where contestants from all over the world would compete.\n\n==Format==\nEach episode features a number of contestants whose objective is to remain on stage for as long as possible. Their act must involve singing one of eight randomly selected songs for each episode, which includes [[Cantopop]], [[Mandopop]], and even English-language [[popular music]]. Besides singing, contestants may also choose to enhance their act by playing an [[musical instrument|instrument]], [[acrobatics]], [[stage magic|magic]], etc.\n\nAt any point during their performance, any of the judges may strike a [[gong]] on the table in front of them, at which point the contestant must stop singing. Their score is determined by the duration of their performance, in seconds, excluding the [[introduction (music)|introduction]], and each second is worth [[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]]100 in [[prize money]]. At the conclusion of each episode, the contestant with the longest act by duration is the night's winner and qualifies for subsequent rounds, and eventually the final round, \"Battle for the King\" ({{lang|zh-hk|\u53ee\u7687\u722d\u9738\u6230}}).\n\nWhile the show is meant to be competitive, judges have been harsh to contestants that they \"ding\" out, and often make fun of them directly. A [[laugh track]] is heavily used instantly whenever one-liners or off-key singing was present, supplementing the [[studio audience]]'s reactions.

The captains program was implemented by the NFL Player Advisory Council established by NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] in conjunction with the [[NFL Players Association]]. Starting in {{NFL Year|2007}}, the league began permitting teams to name up to six players as captains.<ref>* {{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000058893/article/nfl-captains-c-patch-comes-with-varied-roles-responsibilities?module=HP11_content_stream|title=NFL captains: 'C' patch comes with varied roles, responsibilities|publisher=National Football League|last=Darlington|first=Jeff|date=September 6, 2012|accessdate=2012-09-06}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\n'''NFL rule 18''' details the guidelines for team captains. Within Rule 18, there are four articles that pertain to:\n\n# Number of Team Captains\n# Coin Toss Procedures\n# Choice on Penalty Option\n# Change of [Team] Captains\n\n'''Coin Toss Procedures''' \u2013 Each team can send as many as six team captains to the center of the field. On each team, one captain is designated the \"speaking captain\" of the delegation. The visiting team or the team designated \"visitor\" by the referee (if no team is declared 'visitor') shall choose \"heads or tails\" or in the case of a special ceremony coin, the options on the face and rear of that coin.\n\nThe winner of the coin toss have three options, 1. Defer the choice to the second half, 2. Receive/kick the ball, 3. Choose an end zone to defend. There is strategy in employing your election. It could depend on such conditions as weather, or making an aggressive statement at the beginning of the game, or something simple as coming out of the locker room in the second half receiving the ball.\n\nAfter the winning captain makes their choice, the opposing team captain chooses from the remaining two options.\n\n'''Choice on Penalty Option(s)''' \u2013 The offended team captain has a choice of accepting a penalty enforcement or declining, except where said penalty is automatically \"enforced by rule.\" In some circumstances, a team captain may elect to \"decline\" the penalty. This typically happens in a situation in which declining the penalty may mean that the next down should occur (3rd or 4th). A good example would be on an \"offensive holding\" enforcement, the defensive team might elect a \"4th down and 5 yards to gain\" v. a \"3rd down and 15 yards to gain.\"\n\n==The \"C\" Patch==\nPlayers who have been named a team captain typically wear a \"C\" patch on their jerseys. There is a standard design used by all teams participating in the captaincy program. The patches are in team colors and are worn on the front left or right breast (depending on other patches, etc. worn by the specific team). The number of gold stars on the patch represents the number of years that player has been named captain by a team. If he has been named captain for longer than four years, the \"C\" on the patch is gold. On some teams' [[NFL Color Rush|color rush]] jerseys, plus the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]' white uniforms, the stars (and \"C\", for captains with over 4 years of service) use team colors.<ref>https://www.gettyimages.ca/detail/news-photo/quarterback-andy-dalton-of-the-cincinnati-bengals-looks-on-news-photo/1173447541?adppopup=true</ref>\n\nDuring special recognitions, the patch may be a different color; e.g., pink for breast cancer awareness;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d822a6217/article/nfl-supports-breast-cancer-awareness-month |title=NFL supports Breast Cancer Awareness Month |publisher=[[National Football League]] |date=September 28, 2011 |accessdate=2012-12-27}}</ref> or camouflage for military service recognition. In 2018, NFL introduced a new multi-color captain patch for Crucial Catch which the NFL and the American Cancer Society come together to end cancer.<ref>http://www.nfl.com/crucialcatch</ref>\n\nSome teams (e.g. Pittsburgh and New England) do not use the patch on their jerseys but still designate captains. The decision to wear or not wear patches can come from the coach or a team vote.<ref>https://www.titansonline.com/news/why-titans-captains-aren-t-wearing-the-c-patch-17738547</ref> Pittsburgh and New England have never used the patch during the respective lengthy tenures of their head coaches [[Mike Tomlin]] and [[Bill Belichick]], although they have named permanent captains. To date, these two teams and the Ravens have never worn the patch.\n\nOther teams who do not use the patch designate captains weekly. [[John Harbaugh]] has followed this practice since becoming head coach of the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. In the case of the [[Green Bay Packers]], the team named weekly captains during the regular season, but would switch to assigning captains (who wore patches) whenever they qualified for the playoffs. The [[Kansas City Chiefs]] followed the same practice in the 2019 regular season and postseason, naming six captains in advance of their divisional round game versus Houston. With the hiring of head coach [[Matt LaFleur]] in 2019, the Packers began assigning 3 weekly captains alongside 3 permanent captains.\n\nBy and large, teams do not adorn the jerseys of weekly captains with patches. However, in 2019 the [[Carolina Panthers]] voted [[Gerald McCoy]] as a captain for their week 2 matchup with the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]\u2014McCoy's former team\u2014and affixed a patch to his jersey.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tampabay.com/sports/bucs/2019/09/12/gerald-mccoy-voted-a-panthers-captain-tonight/|title=Gerald McCoy: \u2018I\u2019ve been watching y\u2019all dominate this group for years\u2019}}</ref> He continued wearing the patch as the season continued in light of an injury to [[Kawann Short]]. Similarly, [[Efe Obada]] was voted a team captain for the Panthers' NFL London game in week 6, as London is Obada's hometown.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/efe-obada-emotional-london-return-with-carolina-panthers-it-will-stay-with-me-for-rest-of-my-life-a4260456.html|title=Efe Obada on emotional London return with Carolina Panthers: 'It will stay with me for the rest of my life'}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, the NFL changed captains' patches slightly, removing the white outline at the patch's edge. Also, instead of stars \"filled-in\" with gold coloring to indicate years as a captain alongside \"unfilled-in\" white stars (i.e. a player who was in his second year as a captain would have 2 gold stars and 2 white stars on his patch), the patch now simply has gold stars indicating years served.\n\n==Designation==\nWhile NFL rules state that teams may name up to six captains, this rule is not strictly enforced. In 2019, four teams named seven captains at the beginning of the regular season: the [[Detroit Lions]], [[Minnesota Vikings]], [[New England Patriots]], and [[New York Giants]]. That same year, the Carolina Panthers dressed seven players wearing captain patches for their week 2 matchup against Tampa Bay: [[Cam Newton]], [[Greg Olsen (American football)|Greg Olsen]], [[Trai Turner]], [[Luke Kuechly]], [[Gerald McCoy]], [[Kawann Short]], and [[Colin Jones (American football)|Colin Jones]].\n\nCaptains are sometimes decided by team-wide vote, and other times are chosen by the team's head coach.<ref>https://www.latimes.com/sports/nfl/la-sp-nfl-ask-farmer-20180915-story.html</ref> Captains are generally named after the preseason ends, and just prior to the start of the regular season. In the event of an injury to a team captain requiring them to miss one or more games during the season, a replacement may be named. The decision to name (whether weekly or permanently) or not name captains rests with the head coach, who can suspend captainships should they so choose.\n\nOne notable example of suspension occurred when the New York Jets ended the use of designated team captains after an incident involving [[Santonio Holmes]] in a 2011 game. In the fourth quarter of the final game of the 2011 season against the Miami Dolphins, Holmes appeared to get into an argument with Jets offensive tackle [[Wayne Hunter]] while the team was huddling. As a result of the argument, Holmes was benched for the remainder of the game, and the Jets ended up losing the game, which resulted in the Jets missing the postseason for the first time in three years. His leadership qualities and credibilities as captain have since been questioned. Rex Ryan, coach of the Jets at the time, suspended captains for the organization ever since. In 2015, under new head coach [[Todd Bowles]], the Jets resumed appointing captains weekly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/new-york/nfl/story/_/id/7411183/source-captain-santonio-holmes-quit-new-york-jets-loss|title=Source: Captain Holmes 'quit' on Jets in loss|author=|date=January 2012|website=go.com|accessdate=September 9, 2018}}</ref>\nIn Week 2 of 2018, Bowles resumed permanent captains, introduced when the Jets played the Dolphins.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://nypost.com/2018/09/28/why-todd-bowles-finally-selected-five-jets-captains/ |title = Why Todd Bowles finally selected five Jets captains|date = September 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the nature of the game, most teams include their starting quarterbacks as an offensive captain. The starting quarterback has no other responsibility or authority on field. However, he may, depending on the league or individual team, have various informal duties, such as participation in pre-game ceremonies, the coin toss, the trophy presentation, or other events outside the game. Often compared to [[Captain (sports)|captains]] of other team sports, the starting quarterback is usually the ''de facto'' team leader and a well-respected player on and off the field, even before the NFL implemented the team captain's patch in 2007.\n\n==Gold stars==\nEach gold star on a captain's patch indicates the number of seasons the player has served as a team captain. These are often consecutive, but not always: Tampa Bay quarterback [[Jameis Winston]] wore 3 stars on his 2019 patch despite not being named a captain in 2018. He wore 2 stars on his patch in 2017.\n\nTypically, captains have been with their teams several seasons, but it is not uncommon for veterans in their first year with a team to be appointed as a captain. This has sometimes resulted in players receiving credit for multiple years as a team captain with their new teams on their patches, despite being in the first year of their tenures. For example:\n\n*Though he was not a Redskin in the year prior, Redskins quarterback [[Case Keenum]] (who served as a captain during his lone year as a Denver Bronco in 2018) was named a captain and wore a patch with 2 stars for his first game with Washington.\n*Raiders linebacker [[Vontaze Burfict]], in his first year with Oakland, wore 2 stars on his patch in the 2019 season. He served last as a captain during the 2014 season with the [[Cincinnati Bengals]].\n*Giants safety [[Michael Thomas (defensive back)|Michael Thomas]] wore 4 stars on his patch in 2019, though only in his second season with the team. Thomas was a captain for two years with his previous team, the [[Miami Dolphins]].\n*Linebacker [[Thomas Davis (American football)|Thomas Davis]] served as a captain for the Carolina Panthers from 2011\u201318 and wore the all-gold patch indicating 4+ years of captainship, but retained the all-gold patch during his first year as a Los Angeles Charger, perhaps in recognition of years of leadership in Carolina.\n*[[Gerald McCoy]] of the [[Carolina Panthers]] received an all-gold patch upon being named a captain in 2019, his first year as a Panther, but was not named a captain the previous season while with the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. In fact, McCoy had not been a captain since the 2017 season, when he wore the all-gold patch for Tampa Bay.\n*[[Demaryius Thomas]] was named a captain midway through the 2019 season for the [[New York Jets]], who traded for him that September. His patch showed 3 stars, but he had not served as a captain since the 2017 season while with the [[Denver Broncos]], when he also wore 3 stars.\n\nTeams have often used captains patches erroneously and without regard to the stars, with discrepancies occurring even mid-season. The Panthers gave [[Trai Turner]] a gold patch in week 8 of their 2019 season after he missed 3 games due to an ankle injury, though he wore a patch with only 1 star during his previous game in week 3. Case Keenum wore a patch with two stars in week 1 of the 2019 season, but from week 2 on Keenum wore a captain's patch with 4 stars, despite only serving as a captain two seasons of his career.\n\nIn 2017, [[Buffalo Bills]] defensive tackle [[Kyle Williams (defensive tackle)|Kyle Williams]] wore a patch with 5 stars and a gold 'C', but the Bills admitted this was a mistake.<ref>https://uni-watch.com/2017/10/26/c-stands-for-confusing/</ref>\n\n==List of current NFL captains==\nPlayers listed in '''bold''' currently wear the 4+ star all-gold captain patches. These players have been team captains for over 4 seasons, but not necessarily consecutively. Some players below have served as captains for over 4 years, such as [[Tom Brady]] and [[Ben Roethlisberger]], but their teams do not currently wear patches.\n\n\u2020Indicates teams not using captain patches during the 2019 season.<br>\n{{asterisk}}Indicates the number of years a player has served as a captain, represented on the patch by stars.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width: 18%;\" | Team\n! style=\"width: 32%;\" | Offensive captain(s)\n! style=\"width: 34%;\" | Defensive captain(s)\n! style=\"width: 32%;\" | Special teams captain(s)\n|-\n| [[Arizona Cardinals]]<ref>Darren Urban, [https://raisingzona.com/2017/09/04/arizona-cardinals-team-captains-announced/ \"Cardinals Name Their Captains For The 2019 Season], azcardinals.com, September 6, 2019</ref>\n| '''[[Larry Fitzgerald]]''', [[A.Q.

The visiting team or the team designated \"visitor\" by the referee (if no team is declared 'visitor') shall choose \"heads or tails\" or in the case of a special ceremony coin, the options on the face and rear of that coin.\n\nThe winner of the coin toss have three options, 1. Defer the choice to the second half, 2. Receive/kick the ball, 3. Choose an end zone to defend. There is strategy in employing your election. It could depend on such conditions as weather, or making an aggressive statement at the beginning of the game, or something simple as coming out of the locker room in the second half receiving the ball.\n\nAfter the winning captain makes their choice, the opposing team captain chooses from the remaining two options.\n\n'''Choice on Penalty Option(s)''' \u2013 The offended team captain has a choice of accepting a penalty enforcement or declining, except where said penalty is automatically \"enforced by rule.\" In some circumstances, a team captain may elect to \"decline\" the penalty. This typically happens in a situation in which declining the penalty may mean that the next down should occur (3rd or 4th). A good example would be on an \"offensive holding\" enforcement, the defensive team might elect a \"4th down and 5 yards to gain\" v. a \"3rd down and 15 yards to gain.\"\n\n==The \"C\" Patch==\nPlayers who have been named a team captain typically wear a \"C\" patch on their jerseys. There is a standard design used by all teams participating in the captaincy program. The patches are in team colors and are worn on the front left or right breast (depending on other patches, etc. worn by the specific team). The number of gold stars on the patch represents the number of years that player has been named captain by a team. If he has been named captain for longer than four years, the \"C\" on the patch is gold. On some teams' [[NFL Color Rush|color rush]] jerseys, plus the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]' white uniforms, the stars (and \"C\", for captains with over 4 years of service) use team colors.<ref>https://www.gettyimages.ca/detail/news-photo/quarterback-andy-dalton-of-the-cincinnati-bengals-looks-on-news-photo/1173447541?adppopup=true</ref>\n\nDuring special recognitions, the patch may be a different color; e.g., pink for breast cancer awareness;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d822a6217/article/nfl-supports-breast-cancer-awareness-month |title=NFL supports Breast Cancer Awareness Month |publisher=[[National Football League]] |date=September 28, 2011 |accessdate=2012-12-27}}</ref> or camouflage for military service recognition. In 2018, NFL introduced a new multi-color captain patch for Crucial Catch which the NFL and the American Cancer Society come together to end cancer.<ref>http://www.nfl.com/crucialcatch</ref>\n\nSome teams (e.g. Pittsburgh and New England) do not use the patch on their jerseys but still designate captains. The decision to wear or not wear patches can come from the coach or a team vote.<ref>https://www.titansonline.com/news/why-titans-captains-aren-t-wearing-the-c-patch-17738547</ref> Pittsburgh and New England have never used the patch during the respective lengthy tenures of their head coaches [[Mike Tomlin]] and [[Bill Belichick]], although they have named permanent captains. To date, these two teams and the Ravens have never worn the patch.\n\nOther teams who do not use the patch designate captains weekly. [[John Harbaugh]] has followed this practice since becoming head coach of the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. In the case of the [[Green Bay Packers]], the team named weekly captains during the regular season, but would switch to assigning captains (who wore patches) whenever they qualified for the playoffs. The [[Kansas City Chiefs]] followed the same practice in the 2019 regular season and postseason, naming six captains in advance of their divisional round game versus Houston. With the hiring of head coach [[Matt LaFleur]] in 2019, the Packers began assigning 3 weekly captains alongside 3 permanent captains.\n\nBy and large, teams do not adorn the jerseys of weekly captains with patches. However, in 2019 the [[Carolina Panthers]] voted [[Gerald McCoy]] as a captain for their week 2 matchup with the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]\u2014McCoy's former team\u2014and affixed a patch to his jersey.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tampabay.com/sports/bucs/2019/09/12/gerald-mccoy-voted-a-panthers-captain-tonight/|title=Gerald McCoy: \u2018I\u2019ve been watching y\u2019all dominate this group for years\u2019}}</ref> He continued wearing the patch as the season continued in light of an injury to [[Kawann Short]]. Similarly, [[Efe Obada]] was voted a team captain for the Panthers' NFL London game in week 6, as London is Obada's hometown.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/efe-obada-emotional-london-return-with-carolina-panthers-it-will-stay-with-me-for-rest-of-my-life-a4260456.html|title=Efe Obada on emotional London return with Carolina Panthers: 'It will stay with me for the rest of my life'}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, the NFL changed captains' patches slightly, removing the white outline at the patch's edge. Also, instead of stars \"filled-in\" with gold coloring to indicate years as a captain alongside \"unfilled-in\" white stars (i.e. a player who was in his second year as a captain would have 2 gold stars and 2 white stars on his patch), the patch now simply has gold stars indicating years served.\n\n==Designation==\nWhile NFL rules state that teams may name up to six captains, this rule is not strictly enforced. In 2019, four teams named seven captains at the beginning of the regular season: the [[Detroit Lions]], [[Minnesota Vikings]], [[New England Patriots]], and [[New York Giants]]. That same year, the Carolina Panthers dressed seven players wearing captain patches for their week 2 matchup against Tampa Bay: [[Cam Newton]], [[Greg Olsen (American football)|Greg Olsen]], [[Trai Turner]], [[Luke Kuechly]], [[Gerald McCoy]], [[Kawann Short]], and [[Colin Jones (American football)|Colin Jones]].\n\nCaptains are sometimes decided by team-wide vote, and other times are chosen by the team's head coach.<ref>https://www.latimes.com/sports/nfl/la-sp-nfl-ask-farmer-20180915-story.html</ref> Captains are generally named after the preseason ends, and just prior to the start of the regular season. In the event of an injury to a team captain requiring them to miss one or more games during the season, a replacement may be named. The decision to name (whether weekly or permanently) or not name captains rests with the head coach, who can suspend captainships should they so choose.\n\nOne notable example of suspension occurred when the New York Jets ended the use of designated team captains after an incident involving [[Santonio Holmes]] in a 2011 game. In the fourth quarter of the final game of the 2011 season against the Miami Dolphins, Holmes appeared to get into an argument with Jets offensive tackle [[Wayne Hunter]] while the team was huddling. As a result of the argument, Holmes was benched for the remainder of the game, and the Jets ended up losing the game, which resulted in the Jets missing the postseason for the first time in three years. His leadership qualities and credibilities as captain have since been questioned. Rex Ryan, coach of the Jets at the time, suspended captains for the organization ever since. In 2015, under new head coach [[Todd Bowles]], the Jets resumed appointing captains weekly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/new-york/nfl/story/_/id/7411183/source-captain-santonio-holmes-quit-new-york-jets-loss|title=Source: Captain Holmes 'quit' on Jets in loss|author=|date=January 2012|website=go.com|accessdate=September 9, 2018}}</ref>\nIn Week 2 of 2018, Bowles resumed permanent captains, introduced when the Jets played the Dolphins.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://nypost.com/2018/09/28/why-todd-bowles-finally-selected-five-jets-captains/ |title = Why Todd Bowles finally selected five Jets captains|date = September 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the nature of the game, most teams include their starting quarterbacks as an offensive captain. The starting quarterback has no other responsibility or authority on field. However, he may, depending on the league or individual team, have various informal duties, such as participation in pre-game ceremonies, the coin toss, the trophy presentation, or other events outside the game. Often compared to [[Captain (sports)|captains]] of other team sports, the starting quarterback is usually the ''de facto'' team leader and a well-respected player on and off the field, even before the NFL implemented the team captain's patch in 2007.\n\n==Gold stars==\nEach gold star on a captain's patch indicates the number of seasons the player has served as a team captain. These are often consecutive, but not always: Tampa Bay quarterback [[Jameis Winston]] wore 3 stars on his 2019 patch despite not being named a captain in 2018. He wore 2 stars on his patch in 2017.\n\nTypically, captains have been with their teams several seasons, but it is not uncommon for veterans in their first year with a team to be appointed as a captain. This has sometimes resulted in players receiving credit for multiple years as a team captain with their new teams on their patches, despite being in the first year of their tenures. For example:\n\n*Though he was not a Redskin in the year prior, Redskins quarterback [[Case Keenum]] (who served as a captain during his lone year as a Denver Bronco in 2018) was named a captain and wore a patch with 2 stars for his first game with Washington.\n*Raiders linebacker [[Vontaze Burfict]], in his first year with Oakland, wore 2 stars on his patch in the 2019 season. He served last as a captain during the 2014 season with the [[Cincinnati Bengals]].\n*Giants safety [[Michael Thomas (defensive back)|Michael Thomas]] wore 4 stars on his patch in 2019, though only in his second season with the team. Thomas was a captain for two years with his previous team, the [[Miami Dolphins]].\n*Linebacker [[Thomas Davis (American football)|Thomas Davis]] served as a captain for the Carolina Panthers from 2011\u201318 and wore the all-gold patch indicating 4+ years of captainship, but retained the all-gold patch during his first year as a Los Angeles Charger, perhaps in recognition of years of leadership in Carolina.\n*[[Gerald McCoy]] of the [[Carolina Panthers]] received an all-gold patch upon being named a captain in 2019, his first year as a Panther, but was not named a captain the previous season while with the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. In fact, McCoy had not been a captain since the 2017 season, when he wore the all-gold patch for Tampa Bay.\n*[[Demaryius Thomas]] was named a captain midway through the 2019 season for the [[New York Jets]], who traded for him that September. His patch showed 3 stars, but he had not served as a captain since the 2017 season while with the [[Denver Broncos]], when he also wore 3 stars.\n\nTeams have often used captains patches erroneously and without regard to the stars, with discrepancies occurring even mid-season. The Panthers gave [[Trai Turner]] a gold patch in week 8 of their 2019 season after he missed 3 games due to an ankle injury, though he wore a patch with only 1 star during his previous game in week 3. Case Keenum wore a patch with two stars in week 1 of the 2019 season, but from week 2 on Keenum wore a captain's patch with 4 stars, despite only serving as a captain two seasons of his career.\n\nIn 2017, [[Buffalo Bills]] defensive tackle [[Kyle Williams (defensive tackle)|Kyle Williams]] wore a patch with 5 stars and a gold 'C', but the Bills admitted this was a mistake.<ref>https://uni-watch.com/2017/10/26/c-stands-for-confusing/</ref>\n\n==List of current NFL captains==\nPlayers listed in '''bold''' currently wear the 4+ star all-gold captain patches. These players have been team captains for over 4 seasons, but not necessarily consecutively. Some players below have served as captains for over 4 years, such as [[Tom Brady]] and [[Ben Roethlisberger]], but their teams do not currently wear patches.\n\n\u2020Indicates teams not using captain patches during the 2019 season.<br>\n{{asterisk}}Indicates the number of years a player has served as a captain, represented on the patch by stars.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width: 18%;\" | Team\n! style=\"width: 32%;\" | Offensive captain(s)\n! style=\"width: 34%;\" | Defensive captain(s)\n! style=\"width: 32%;\" | Special teams captain(s)\n|-\n| [[Arizona Cardinals]]<ref>Darren Urban, [https://raisingzona.com/2017/09/04/arizona-cardinals-team-captains-announced/ \"Cardinals Name Their Captains For The 2019 Season], azcardinals.com, September 6, 2019</ref>\n| '''[[Larry Fitzgerald]]''', [[A.Q.

After completing [[Danish Folkeskole Education]] in 1963, she attended the Commercial School in Copenhagen (1963\u20131965). From 1963 to 1967, she worked as a home care assistant for the elderly in [[Gentofte]]. From 1978 to 1984, she was employed as an office assistant in connection with insurance and advertising activities.<ref name=\"Folketinget\">{{ft.dk link}}. Accessed on 29 June 2019.</ref> In 1967, Kj\u00e6rsgaard married Henrik Thorup, an insurance underwriter. Thorup went on to become a chairperson and regional council member in the DPP, and currently works as a government accountant.\nShe has two children, a daughter named Nan and a son named Troels.\n\n==Political career==\n\n===Parliament===\nKj\u00e6rsgaard began her political career as the [[Progress Party (Denmark)|Progress Party's]] candidate in the Ryvang nomination district (1979\u20131981), followed by the [[Ballerup]] and [[Gladsaxe]] nomination district (1981\u20131983), the [[Hvidovre]] nomination district (1983\u20131984), and finally, the [[Middelfart]] nomination district (1984\u20131995).<ref name=\"Folketinget\"/>\n\nIn 1984, while still with the Progress Party, she secured her first seat in the [[Folketing]] (Danish parliament), representing the [[Copenhagen County]] constituency (10 January 1984&nbsp;\u2013 8 September 1987). She next represented the [[Funen County]] constituency (8 September 1987&nbsp;\u2013 6 October 1995).<ref name=\"Folketinget\"/>\n\nIn 1995, as things were growing increasingly chaotic and anarchic in the Progress Party, Kj\u00e6rsgaard broke away to co-found the [[Danish People's Party]] (DPP). She stood as the DPP candidate in the [[Glostrup]] nomination district in 1997, followed by the [[Hellerup]] and Gentofte nomination district (1997\u20132005). As a DPP candidate, she won a seat in the Folketing, representing the Funen County constituency (6 October 1995&nbsp;\u2013 11 March 1998).<ref name=\"Folketinget\"/>\n\nAs support for the Progress Party subsequently dwindled away, the DPP grew. By 2001, it had become the third largest party in the Folketing, securing 12% of the vote. In the [[2005 Danish parliamentary election|2005 election]], the DPP's share grew to 13.2%, with Kj\u00e6rsgaard receiving 38,347 \"personal votes\", second to only the [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]], [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]].\n\n===Speaker of the Folketing===\nOn 3 July 2015, following the success of Kj\u00e6rsgaard's party in the [[2015 Danish general election|June 2015 parliamentary election]], she was elected the [[List of Speakers of the Parliament of Denmark|first female speaker]] of the [[Folketing]] (but not the first female speaker in ''parliament'' since, in 1950 when Denmark still had a bicameral system, [[Ingeborg Hansen]] became the first Danish female parliamentary speaker when she was elected speaker of the [[Landstinget|Landsting]]). Kj\u00e6rsgaard was proposed both by the four parties supporting [[Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen]]'s new government, and from the opposition by the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] and the Greenlandic [[Siumut]].\n\n===The Danish People's Party===\nThe Danish People's Party advocates a primarily [[nationalism|nationalist]] and [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] platform,<ref name=\"dppwebsite\">{{cite web| title =Danish Peoples Party Program of Principles| publisher =Dansk Folkparti| url =http://www.danskfolkeparti.dk/Principprogram.asp| accessdate =13 November 2008| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130530234015/http://www.danskfolkeparti.dk/Principprogram.asp| archivedate =30 May 2013}}</ref> and is, in that regard, aligned ideologically with other European [[far right]] parties.<ref name=CNN-far-right>{{cite news |last=Lister |first=Tim |title=Europe's resurgent far right focuses on immigration, multiculturalism |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-07-24/world/europe.far.right_1_political-parties-multiculturalism-danish-people-s-party/2?_s=PM:WORLD |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130120003344/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-07-24/world/europe.far.right_1_political-parties-multiculturalism-danish-people-s-party/2?_s=PM:WORLD |url-status=dead |archive-date=20 January 2013 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=2 October 2012 }}</ref> The DPP's platform also includes toughening the criminal code and supporting social welfare policies<ref name=\"dppwebsite\" /> that have traditionally been championed by the center-left [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]].\n\nThe DPP achieved considerable success in the [[2001 Danish parliamentary election|2001 elections]], becoming the third largest party in the [[Folketing]].

She next represented the [[Funen County]] constituency (8 September 1987&nbsp;\u2013 6 October 1995).<ref name=\"Folketinget\"/>\n\nIn 1995, as things were growing increasingly chaotic and anarchic in the Progress Party, Kj\u00e6rsgaard broke away to co-found the [[Danish People's Party]] (DPP). She stood as the DPP candidate in the [[Glostrup]] nomination district in 1997, followed by the [[Hellerup]] and Gentofte nomination district (1997\u20132005).

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nHaving lost several aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated defensive threat of the 20mm cannons in the nose and tail along with the twin .50 Cal machine guns in the dorsal turret. They also liked the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the nine P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they retained three [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-5F and one P2V-3 Neptunes]]. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same armament configuration as the P4Ms, and their dash speed capability came from [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A-3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron.\n\nOn 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Dean Boys' History of EC-121|url =http://www.dean-boys.com/ec-121.htm|website = www.dean-boys.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D.

All fifteen Navy and four Army aircrew were killed.\n\nIn October 1962, the WV-2Q was redesignated the EC-121M Super Constellation.<ref name=\":0\" /> and in the same month the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E. Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in [[Naples, Italy]]. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived.

This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. As the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D.

The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n=== 1980s ===\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 2000s ===\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nHaving lost several aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated defensive threat of the 20mm cannons in the nose and tail along with the twin .50 Cal machine guns in the dorsal turret. They also liked the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the nine P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they retained three [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-5F and one P2V-3 Neptunes]]. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same armament configuration as the P4Ms, and their dash speed capability came from [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A-3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron.\n\nOn 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Dean Boys' History of EC-121|url =http://www.dean-boys.com/ec-121.htm|website = www.dean-boys.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D. Clay Kaserne|Wiesbaden Air Base]], took off from [[F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck Air Base]] on a training flight. Inflight, the rear cargo door opened causing the tail to separate from the remainder of the fuselage at the main cargo door. The main fuselage and tail section crashed southwest of [[Markt Schwaben]].<ref name=\"StaHypo\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

All fifteen Navy and four Army aircrew were killed.\n\nIn October 1962, the WV-2Q was redesignated the EC-121M Super Constellation.<ref name=\":0\" /> and in the same month the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E. Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in [[Naples, Italy]]. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived. Two squadron junior officers on their way in to the command were the first people to the crash site.<ref name=\"AvSafety\">{{Cite web|title =Accident Douglas EA-3B Skywarrior 142670, 04 Jun 1968|url =https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/158670|website = aviation-safety.net|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>\n\nThe loss of the USS Liberty during the Six Day War in 1967, reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. As the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)|USS ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']] in the Mediterranean. The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier<ref name=\"East\" />.

The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n=== 1980s ===\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 2000s ===\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.
