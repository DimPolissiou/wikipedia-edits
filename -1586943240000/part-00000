Thus, therefore, the name of this large, delicious and famous sweetmeat is '''Shahi Jilapi'''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amidst a delicious chaos|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/wide-angle/amidst-delicious-chaos-1417687|publisher=[[The Daily Star\u00a0(Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n\n==Ingredients==\n*[[Vigna mungo|Mashkolai dal]]\n*[[Baking powder]]\n*[[Sugar syrup]]\n*Pea-flour\n*[[Ghee]]\n*[[Dalda]]\n*[[Flour]] \n*[[Cooking oil|Oil]]\n*[[Rose water]]\n*[[Cinnamon]]\n*[[Cardamom]]\netc.\n\n==Preparations==\nAt first ingredients like [[flour]], [[baking powder]], [[powdered milk]] and [[salt]] are mixed together.  A paste is made by mixing [[Milk|hot milk]] and [[flour]] together . After rubbing the paste by hands like the dough of a [[ruti]], it is then divided into several pieces and each of the piece is given a long shape. Then the pieces are turned into coil shape by twisting and get deep fried into [[Cooking oil|oil]]. Syrup is made from [[sugar]], [[water]], [[cinnamon]] and  [[cardamom]] in another pot keeping in mind that the syrup shouldn't be too thick or heavy. After that, the fried jilapies are then poured into the syrup as early as possible and get heated again for 4-5 minutes. As a result, the jilapies swells a little bigger. Then, for a couple of hours, the jilapies are kept inside the syrup so that all of the juice enters into the jilapi which makes them almost two times bigger. This is how the delicious shahi jilapi is made.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shahi jilapi|url=https://m.risingbd.com/recipes/news/227943/%E0%A6%B6%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B9%E0%A7%80-%E0%A6%9C%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%BF|publisher=[[Risingbd.com]]|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n[[File:Jilapi3.JPG|thumb]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Bangladeshi dishes}}\n\n[[Category:Bangladeshi desserts]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toHot(link removed) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahi_jilapi"}

It is a common substance found in [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] as the [[mineral]]s [[calcite]] and [[aragonite]] (most notably as [[limestone]], which is a type of sedimentary rock consisting mainly of calcite) and is the main component of [[pearl]]s and the [[Seashell|shells of marine organisms]], [[snail]]s, and eggs. Calcium carbonate is the active ingredient in [[agricultural lime]] and is created when calcium ions in [[hard water]] react with [[carbonate ion]]s to create [[limescale]]. It is medicinally used as a [[calcium]] supplement or as an [[antacid]], but excessive consumption can be hazardous and cause poor digestion.\n\n==Chemistry==\nCalcium carbonate shares the typical properties of other carbonates. Notably it\n* reacts with [[acid]]s, releasing [[carbon dioxide]] (technically speaking, [[carbonic acid]], but that disintegrates quickly to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O):\n::CaCO<sub>3</sub>({{abbr|s|solid}}) + 2&nbsp;H<sup>+</sup>({{abbr|aq|aqueous solution}}) \u2192 Ca<sup>2+</sup>({{abbr|aq|aqueous solution}}) + CO<sub>2</sub>({{abbr|g|gas}}) + H<sub>2</sub>O({{abbr|l|liquid}})\n* releases carbon dioxide upon heating, called a [[thermal decomposition]] reaction, or [[calcination]] (to above 840&nbsp;\u00b0C in the case of CaCO<sub>3</sub>), to form [[calcium oxide]], commonly called [[quicklime]], with reaction [[enthalpy]] 178&nbsp;kJ/mol:\n::CaCO<sub>3</sub>({{abbr|s|solid}}) \u2192 CaO({{abbr|s|solid}}) + CO<sub>2</sub>({{abbr|g|gas}})\n\nCalcium carbonate will react with water that is saturated with carbon dioxide to form the soluble [[calcium bicarbonate]].\n:CaCO<sub>3</sub>({{abbr|s|solid}}) + CO<sub>2</sub>({{abbr|g|gas}}) + H<sub>2</sub>O({{abbr|l|liquid}}) \u2192 Ca(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>({{abbr|aq|aqueous solution}})\n\nThis reaction is important in the [[erosion]] of [[carbonate rock]], forming [[cavern]]s, and leads to [[hard water]] in many regions.\n\nAn unusual form of calcium carbonate is the hexahydrate, [[ikaite]], CaCO<sub>3</sub>\u00b76H<sub>2</sub>O. Ikaite is stable only below 8&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\n==Preparation==\nThe vast majority of calcium carbonate used in industry is extracted by mining or quarrying. Pure calcium carbonate (such as for food or pharmaceutical use), can be produced from a pure quarried source (usually [[marble]]).\n\nAlternatively, calcium carbonate is prepared from [[calcium oxide]]. Water is added to give [[calcium hydroxide]] then [[carbon dioxide]] is passed through this solution to precipitate the desired calcium carbonate, referred to in the industry as precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC):<ref name=\"PCC\">{{cite web|title = Precipitated Calcium Carbonate|accessdate = 11 January 2014|url = http://www.lime.org/uses_of_lime/other_uses/precip_cc.asp|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140111165543/http://www.lime.org/uses_of_lime/other_uses/precip_cc.asp|archive-date = 11 January 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n:CaO + H<sub>2</sub>O \u2192 Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>\n:Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> \u2192 CaCO<sub>3</sub>\u2193 + H<sub>2</sub>O\n\n==Structure==\nThe thermodynamically stable form of CaCO<sub>3</sub> under normal conditions is [[Hexagonal crystal family|hexagonal]] \u03b2-CaCO<sub>3</sub> (the mineral [[calcite]]).<ref name =\"Ropp\">{{cite book|first=R.

Calcium carbonate occurs as [[aragonite]], [[calcite]] and [[dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]] as significant constituents of the [[calcium cycle]]. The [[carbonate mineral]]s form the rock types: [[limestone]], [[chalk]], [[marble]], [[travertine]], [[tufa]], and others.\n\nIn warm, clear tropical waters [[coral]]s are more abundant than towards the poles where the waters are cold. Calcium carbonate contributors, including [[plankton]] (such as [[coccolith]]s and planktic [[foraminifera]]), [[coralline algae]], [[sea sponge|sponges]], [[brachiopod]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, [[bryozoa]] and [[Mollusc shell|mollusks]], are typically found in shallow water environments where sunlight and filterable food are more abundant. Cold-water carbonates do exist at higher latitudes but have a very slow growth rate. The [[calcification]] processes are changed by [[ocean acidification]].\n\nWhere the [[oceanic crust]] is [[Subduction|subducted]] under a [[continental plate]] sediments will be carried down to warmer zones in the [[asthenosphere]] and [[lithosphere]]. Under these conditions calcium carbonate decomposes to produce [[carbon dioxide]] which, along with other gases, give rise to explosive [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]].\n\n===Carbonate compensation depth===\nThe [[carbonate compensation depth]] (CCD) is the point in the ocean where the rate of precipitation of calcium carbonate is balanced by the rate of dissolution due to the conditions present. Deep in the ocean, the temperature drops and pressure increases. Calcium carbonate is unusual in that its solubility increases with decreasing temperature.<ref name=\"weyl1959\">{{cite journal |last1=Weyl |first1=P.K. |title=The change in solubility of calcium carbonate with temperature and carbon dioxide content |journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta |date=1959 |volume=17 |issue=3\u20134 |pages=214\u2013225 |doi=10.1016/0016-7037(59)90096-1}}</ref> Increasing pressure also increases the solubility of calcium carbonate.

The temperature at which limestone yields calcium oxide is usually given as 825&nbsp;\u00b0C, but stating an absolute threshold is misleading. Calcium carbonate exists in equilibrium with calcium oxide and [[carbon dioxide]] at any temperature. At each temperature there is a [[partial pressure]] of carbon dioxide that is in equilibrium with calcium carbonate.

Note that for ''P''<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> = 10<sup>\u221212</sup>&nbsp;atm, the {{nowrap|[Ca<sup>2+</sup>][OH<sup>\u2212</sup>]<sup>2</sup>}} product is still below the solubility product of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> ({{val|8e-6}}). For still lower CO<sub>2</sub> pressure, Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> precipitation will occur before CaCO<sub>3</sub> precipitation.\n* As ambient CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure increases to levels above atmospheric, pH drops, and much of the carbonate ion is converted to bicarbonate ion, which results in higher solubility of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.\n\nThe effect of the latter is especially evident in day-to-day life of people who have hard water. Water in aquifers underground can be exposed to levels of CO<sub>2</sub> much higher than atmospheric. As such water percolates through calcium carbonate rock, the CaCO<sub>3</sub> dissolves according to the second trend. When that same water then emerges from the tap, in time it comes into equilibrium with CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the air by outgassing its excess CO<sub>2</sub>. The calcium carbonate becomes less soluble as a result, and the excess precipitates as lime scale. This same process is responsible for the formation of [[stalactites]] and [[stalagmite]]s in limestone caves.\n\nTwo hydrated phases of calcium carbonate, [[monohydrocalcite]] CaCO<sub>3</sub>\u00b7H<sub>2</sub>O and [[ikaite]] CaCO<sub>3</sub>\u00b76H<sub>2</sub>O, may [[precipitate]] from water at ambient conditions and persist as metastable phases.\n\n=== With varying pH, temperature and salinity: CaCO<sub>3</sub> scaling in swimming pools ===\n[[File:CaCO3-pH.gif|thumb|alt=Effects of salinity and pH on the maximum calcium ion level before scaling is anticipated at 25 C and 1 mM bicarbonate (e.g. in swimming pools)]]\n[[File:CaCO3-Temp.gif|thumb|alt=Effects of temperature and bicarbonate concentration on the maximum calcium ion level before scaling is anticipated at pH&nbsp;7 and 5,000&nbsp;ppm salinity (such as in swimming pools)]]\nIn contrast to the open equilibrium scenario above, many swimming pools are managed by addition of [[sodium bicarbonate]] (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) to about 2 mM as a buffer, then control of pH through use of HCl, NaHSO<sub>4</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, NaOH or chlorine formulations that are acidic or basic.

It is a common substance found in [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] as the [[mineral]]s [[calcite]] and [[aragonite]] (most notably as [[limestone]], which is a type of sedimentary rock consisting mainly of calcite) and is the main component of [[pearl]]s and the [[Seashell|shells of marine organisms]], [[snail]]s, and eggs. Calcium carbonate is the active ingredient in [[agricultural lime]] and is created when calcium ions in [[hard water]] react with [[carbonate ion]]s to create [[limescale]]. It is medicinally used as a [[calcium]] supplement or as an [[antacid]], but excessive consumption can be hazardous and cause poor digestion.\n\n==Chemistry==\nCalcium carbonate shares the typical properties of other carbonates. Notably it\n* reacts with [[acid]]s, releasing [[carbon dioxide]] (technically speaking, [[carbonic acid]], but that disintegrates quickly to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O):\n::CaCO<sub>3</sub>({{abbr|s|solid}}) + 2&nbsp;H<sup>+</sup>({{abbr|aq|aqueous solution}}) \u2192 Ca<sup>2+</sup>({{abbr|aq|aqueous solution}}) + CO<sub>2</sub>({{abbr|g|gas}}) + H<sub>2</sub>O({{abbr|l|liquid}})\n* releases carbon dioxide upon heating, called a [[thermal decomposition]] reaction, or [[calcination]] (to above 840&nbsp;\u00b0C in the case of CaCO<sub>3</sub>), to form [[calcium oxide]], commonly called [[quicklime]], with reaction [[enthalpy]] 178&nbsp;kJ/mol:\n::CaCO<sub>3</sub>({{abbr|s|solid}}) \u2192 CaO({{abbr|s|solid}}) + CO<sub>2</sub>({{abbr|g|gas}})\n\nCalcium carbonate will react with water that is saturated with carbon dioxide to form the soluble [[calcium bicarbonate]].\n:CaCO<sub>3</sub>({{abbr|s|solid}}) + CO<sub>2</sub>({{abbr|g|gas}}) + H<sub>2</sub>O({{abbr|l|liquid}}) \u2192 Ca(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>({{abbr|aq|aqueous solution}})\n\nThis reaction is important in the [[erosion]] of [[carbonate rock]], forming [[cavern]]s, and leads to [[hard water]] in many regions.\n\nAn unusual form of calcium carbonate is the hexahydrate, [[ikaite]], CaCO<sub>3</sub>\u00b76H<sub>2</sub>O.

Calcium carbonate occurs as [[aragonite]], [[calcite]] and [[dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]] as significant constituents of the [[calcium cycle]]. The [[carbonate mineral]]s form the rock types: [[limestone]], [[chalk]], [[marble]], [[travertine]], [[tufa]], and others.\n\nIn warm, clear tropical waters [[coral]]s are more abundant than towards the poles where the waters are cold. Calcium carbonate contributors, including [[plankton]] (such as [[coccolith]]s and planktic [[foraminifera]]), [[coralline algae]], [[sea sponge|sponges]], [[brachiopod]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, [[bryozoa]] and [[Mollusc shell|mollusks]], are typically found in shallow water environments where sunlight and filterable food are more abundant. Cold-water carbonates do exist at higher latitudes but have a very slow growth rate. The [[calcification]] processes are changed by [[ocean acidification]].\n\nWhere the [[oceanic crust]] is [[Subduction|subducted]] under a [[continental plate]] sediments will be carried down to warmer zones in the [[asthenosphere]] and [[lithosphere]]. Under these conditions calcium carbonate decomposes to produce [[carbon dioxide]] which, along with other gases, give rise to explosive [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]].\n\n===Carbonate compensation depth===\nThe [[carbonate compensation depth]] (CCD) is the point in the ocean where the rate of precipitation of calcium carbonate is balanced by the rate of dissolution due to the conditions present. Deep in the ocean, the temperature drops and pressure increases. Calcium carbonate is unusual in that its solubility increases with decreasing temperature.<ref name=\"weyl1959\">{{cite journal |last1=Weyl |first1=P.K. |title=The change in solubility of calcium carbonate with temperature and carbon dioxide content |journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta |date=1959 |volume=17 |issue=3\u20134 |pages=214\u2013225 |doi=10.1016/0016-7037(59)90096-1}}</ref> Increasing pressure also increases the solubility of calcium carbonate.

The temperature at which limestone yields calcium oxide is usually given as 825&nbsp;\u00b0C, but stating an absolute threshold is misleading. Calcium carbonate exists in equilibrium with calcium oxide and [[carbon dioxide]] at any temperature. At each temperature there is a [[partial pressure]] of carbon dioxide that is in equilibrium with calcium carbonate. At room temperature the equilibrium overwhelmingly favors calcium carbonate, because the equilibrium CO<sub>2</sub> pressure is only a tiny fraction of the partial CO<sub>2</sub> pressure in air, which is about 0.035&nbsp;kPa.\n\nAt temperatures above 550&nbsp;\u00b0C the equilibrium CO<sub>2</sub> pressure begins to exceed the CO<sub>2</sub> pressure in air. So above 550&nbsp;\u00b0C, calcium carbonate begins to outgas CO<sub>2</sub> into air. However, in a charcoal fired kiln, the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> will be much higher than it is in air. Indeed, if all the [[oxygen]] in the kiln is consumed in the fire, then the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> in the kiln can be as high as 20&nbsp;kPa.<ref name=\"solvaypcc2007\">{{cite web|title = Solvay Precipitated Calcium Carbonate: Production|publisher = Solvay |date=9 March 2007|accessdate = 30 December 2007|url = http://www.solvaypcc.com/safety_environment/0,0,1000044-_EN,00.html}}</ref>\n\nThe table shows that this partial pressure is not achieved until the temperature is nearly 800&nbsp;\u00b0C.

At extremely low ''P''<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, dissolved CO<sub>2</sub>, bicarbonate ion, and carbonate ion largely evaporate from the solution, leaving a highly alkaline solution of [[calcium hydroxide]], which is more soluble than CaCO<sub>3</sub>. Note that for ''P''<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> = 10<sup>\u221212</sup>&nbsp;atm, the {{nowrap|[Ca<sup>2+</sup>][OH<sup>\u2212</sup>]<sup>2</sup>}} product is still below the solubility product of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> ({{val|8e-6}}). For still lower CO<sub>2</sub> pressure, Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> precipitation will occur before CaCO<sub>3</sub> precipitation.\n* As ambient CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure increases to levels above atmospheric, pH drops, and much of the carbonate ion is converted to bicarbonate ion, which results in higher solubility of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.\n\nThe effect of the latter is especially evident in day-to-day life of people who have hard water. Water in aquifers underground can be exposed to levels of CO<sub>2</sub> much higher than atmospheric. As such water percolates through calcium carbonate rock, the CaCO<sub>3</sub> dissolves according to the second trend. When that same water then emerges from the tap, in time it comes into equilibrium with CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the air by outgassing its excess CO<sub>2</sub>. The calcium carbonate becomes less soluble as a result and the excess precipitates as lime scale. This same process is responsible for the formation of [[stalactites]] and [[stalagmite]]s in limestone caves.\n\nTwo hydrated phases of calcium carbonate, [[monohydrocalcite]], CaCO<sub>3</sub>\u00b7H<sub>2</sub>O and [[ikaite]], CaCO<sub>3</sub>\u00b76H<sub>2</sub>O, may [[precipitate]] from water at ambient conditions and persist as metastable phases.\n\n=== With varying pH, temperature and salinity: CaCO<sub>3</sub> scaling in swimming pools ===\n[[File:CaCO3-pH.gif|thumb|alt=Effects of salinity and pH on the maximum calcium ion level before scaling is anticipated at 25 C and 1 mM bicarbonate (e.g. in swimming pools)]]\n[[File:CaCO3-Temp.gif|thumb|alt=Effects of temperature and bicarbonate concentration on the maximum calcium ion level before scaling is anticipated at pH&nbsp;7 and 5,000&nbsp;ppm salinity (such as in swimming pools)]]\nIn contrast to the open equilibrium scenario above, many swimming pools are managed by addition of [[sodium bicarbonate]] (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) to about 2 mM as a buffer, then control of pH through use of HCl, NaHSO<sub>4</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, NaOH or chlorine formulations that are acidic or basic.

For vanishing acid concentrations, one can recover the final pH and the solubility of CaCO<sub>3</sub> in pure water.\n* In the case of a weak monoacid (here we take acetic acid with [[pKa|p''K''<sub>a</sub>]] = 4.76) with decreasing total acid concentration {{nowrap|1=[A] = [A<sup>\u2212</sup>] + [AH]}}, we obtain:\n\n::{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=\"160\" |[A] (mol/L)\n| 1\n| 10<sup>\u22121</sup>\n| 10<sup>\u22122</sup>\n| 10<sup>\u22123</sup>\n| 10<sup>\u22124</sup>\n| 10<sup>\u22125</sup>\n| 10<sup>\u22126</sup>\n| 10<sup>\u22127</sup>\n| 10<sup>\u221210</sup>\n|-\n! width=\"160\" |Initial pH\n| 2.38||2.88||3.39||3.91||4.47||5.15||6.02||6.79||7.00\n|-\n! width=\"160\" |Final pH\n| 6.75||7.25||7.75||8.14||8.25||8.26||8.26||8.26||8.27\n|-\n! width=\"160\" |Dissolved CaCO<sub>3</sub><br />([[g/L]] of acid)\n| 49.5||4.99||0.513||0.0848||0.0504||0.0474||0.0471||0.0470||0.0470\n|}\n:For the same total acid concentration, the initial pH of the weak acid is less acid than the one of the strong acid; however, the maximum amount of CaCO<sub>3</sub> which can be dissolved is approximately the same. This is because in the final state, the pH is larger than the p''K''<sub>a</sub>, so that the weak acid is almost completely dissociated, yielding in the end as many H<sup>+</sup> ions as the strong acid to \"dissolve\" the calcium carbonate.\n* The calculation in the case of [[phosphoric acid]] (which is the most widely used for domestic applications) is more complicated since the concentrations of the four dissociation states corresponding to this acid must be calculated together with [{{chem|HCO|3|\u2212}}], [{{chem|CO|3|2\u2212}}], [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], [H<sup>+</sup>] and [OH<sup>\u2212</sup>]. The system may be reduced to a seventh degree equation for [H<sup>+</sup>] the numerical solution of which gives\n\n::{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=\"160\" |[A] (mol/L)\n| 1\n| 10<sup>\u22121</sup>\n| 10<sup>\u22122</sup>\n| 10<sup>\u22123</sup>\n| 10<sup>\u22124</sup>\n| 10<sup>\u22125</sup>\n| 10<sup>\u22126</sup>\n| 10<sup>\u22127</sup>\n| 10<sup>\u221210</sup>\n|-\n! width=\"160\" |Initial pH\n| 1.08||1.62||2.25||3.05||4.01||5.00||5.97||6.74||7.00\n|-\n! width=\"160\" |Final pH\n| 6.71||7.17||7.63||8.06||8.24||8.26||8.26||8.26||8.27\n|-\n! width=\"160\" |Dissolved CaCO<sub>3</sub><br />([[g/L]] of acid)\n| 62.0||7.39||0.874||0.123||0.0536||0.0477||0.0471||0.0471||0.0470\n|}\n\n:where [A] = [H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>] + [{{chem|H|2|PO|4|\u2212}}] + [{{chem|HPO|4|2\u2212}}] + [{{chem|PO|4|3\u2212}}] is the total acid concentration. Thus phosphoric acid is more efficient than a monoacid since at the final almost neutral pH, the second dissociated state concentration [{{chem|HPO|4|2\u2212}}] is not negligible (see [[phosphoric acid#pH and composition of a phosphoric acid aqueous solution|phosphoric acid]]).\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Cuttlebone]]\n* [[Cuttlefish]]\n* [[Gesso]]\n* [[Limescale]]\n* [[Marble]]\n* [[Ocean acidification]]\n* [[ Whiting event]]\n* [[List of climate engineering topics]]\n* [[Lysocline]]{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{ICSC|1193|11}}\n* {{PubChemLink|516889}}\n* [[ATC codes]]: {{ATC|A02|AC01}} and {{ATC|A12|AA04}}\n* [http://calcium-carbonate.org.uk/calcium-carbonate.asp The British Calcium Carbonate Association \u2013 What is calcium carbonate]\n* [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0090.html CDC \u2013 NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards \u2013 Calcium Carbonate]\n\n{{Calcium compounds}}\n{{Antacids}}\n{{Drugs for treatment of hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Calcium Carbonate}}\n[[Category:Calcium compounds]]\n[[Category:Carbonates]]\n[[Category:Limestone]]\n[[Category:Phosphate binders]]\n[[Category:Excipients]]\n[[Category:Antacids]]\n[[Category:Food stabilizers]]\n[[Category:E-number additives]]\n", "name_user": "Mikhail Ryazanov", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eWith varying CO2 pressure:punct.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_carbonate"}
