{"title_page": "Musical note", "text_new": "<noinclude>{{User:RMCD bot/subject notice|1=Note (music)|2=Talk:Musical note#Requested move 11 April 2020 }}\n</noinclude>{{short description|Sign used in musical notation, a pitched sound}}\nIn [[music]], a '''note''' is a symbol denoting a musical sound. In English usage a note is also the sound itself.\n\nNotes can represent the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] and [[Duration (music)|duration]] of a sound in [[musical notation]]. A note can also represent a [[pitch class]].\n\nNotes are the building blocks of much written music: [[musical analysis#Discretization|discretizations]] of musical phenomena that facilitate performance, comprehension, and [[musical analysis|analysis]].<ref>Nattiez 1990, p. 81, note 9</ref>\n\nThe term ''note'' can be used in both generic and specific senses: one might say either \"the piece '[[Happy Birthday to You]]' begins with two notes having the same pitch\", or \"the piece begins with two repetitions of the same note\". In the former case, one uses ''note'' to refer to a specific musical event; in the latter, one uses the term to refer to a class of events sharing the same pitch. (See also: [[Key signature names and translations]].)\n\n[[File:Treble a.svg|right|250px|thumb|The note ''A'' or ''La'']]\n[[File:Cifrado americano.JPG|right|thumb|Names of some notes]]\n\nTwo notes with [[fundamental frequency|fundamental frequencies]] in a ratio equal to any integer power of two (e.g., half, twice, or four times) are perceived as very similar. Because of that, all notes with these kinds of relations can be grouped under the same [[pitch class]].\n\nIn traditional music theory, most countries in the world use the [[solf\u00e8ge]] naming convention Do\u2013Re\u2013Mi\u2013Fa\u2013Sol\u2013La\u2013Si, including for instance Italy, Portugal, Spain, France, Romania, most Latin American countries, Greece, Albania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Russia, and all the Arabic-speaking or Persian-speaking countries. However, in English- and Dutch-speaking regions, pitch classes are typically represented by the first seven letters of the Latin alphabet (A, B, C, D, E, F and G). A few European countries, including Germany, adopt an almost identical notation, in which H substitutes for B (see below for details). {{citation needed-span|date=April 2020|text=In Indian music the [[Sanskrit]] names Sa\u2013Re\u2013Ga\u2013Ma\u2013Pa\u2013Dha\u2013Ni (\u0938\u093e-\u0930\u0947-\u0917\u093e-\u092e\u093e-\u092a\u093e-\u0927\u093e-\u0928\u093f) are used, as in Telugu Sa\u2013Ri\u2013Ga\u2013Ma\u2013Pa\u2013Da\u2013Ni (\u0c38\u2013\u0c30\u0c3f\u2013\u0c17\u2013\u0c2e\u2013\u0c2a\u2013\u0c26\u2013\u0c28\u0c3f), in Tamil (\u0b9a\u2013\u0bb0\u0bbf\u2013\u0b95\u2013\u0bae\u2013\u0baa\u2013\u0ba4\u2013\u0ba8\u0bbf) and in Malayalam (\u0d38-\u0d30\u0d3f-\u0d17-\u0d2e-\u0d2a-\u0d27-\u0d28\u0d3f).}} Byzantium used the names Pa\u2013Vu\u2013Ga\u2013Di\u2013Ke\u2013Zo\u2013Ni (\u03a0\u03b1\u2014\u0392\u03bf\u03c5\u2014\u0393\u03b1\u2014\u0394\u03b9\u2014\u039a\u03b5\u2014\u0396\u03c9\u2014\u039d\u03b7).<ref>{{cite book| title=Byzantine Music in Theory and in Practice | author= Savas I. Savas | year=1965 | publisher=Hercules Press | translator=Nicholas Dufault}}</ref>\n\nThe eighth note, or [[octave]], is given the same name as the first, but has double its frequency. The name octave is also used to indicate the span between a note and another with double frequency. To differentiate two notes that have the same pitch class but fall into different octaves, the system of [[scientific pitch notation]] combines a letter name with an Arabic numeral designating a specific octave. For example, the now-standard tuning pitch for most Western music, 440&nbsp;Hz, is named a\u2032 or A4.\n\nThere are two formal systems to define each note and octave, the [[Helmholtz pitch notation]] and the [[scientific pitch notation]].\n\n== Accidentals ==\n\nLetter names are modified by the [[accidental (music)|accidentals]]. The [[sharp (music)|sharp sign]] {{music|sharp}} raises a note by a [[semitone]] or half-step, and a [[flat (music)|flat]] {{music|flat}} lowers it by the same amount. In [[Equal temperament|modern tuning]] a [[half step]] has a frequency ratio of [[Twelfth root of two|{{radic|2|12}}]], approximately 1.0595. The accidentals are written after the note name: so, for example, F{{music|sharp}} represents F-sharp, B{{music|flat}} is B-flat, and C{{music|natural}} is C natural (or C).\n[[File:frequency vs name.svg|frame|right|Frequency vs position on [[treble clef]]. Each note shown has a frequency of the previous note multiplied by {{radic|2|12}}]]\n\nAdditional accidentals are the double-sharp {{music|##}}, raising the frequency by two semitones, and double-flat {{music|bb}}, lowering it by that amount.\n\nIn musical notation, accidentals are placed before the note symbols. Systematic alterations to the seven lettered pitches in the scale can be indicated by placing the symbols in the [[key signature]], which then apply implicitly to all occurrences of corresponding notes. Explicitly noted accidentals can be used to override this effect for the remainder of a bar. A special accidental, the [[natural (music)|natural]] symbol {{music|natural}}, is used to indicate a pitch unmodified by the alterations in the key signature. Effects of key signature and local accidentals do not accumulate. If the key signature indicates G{{music|sharp}}, a local flat before a G makes it G{{music|flat}} (not G{{music|natural}}), though often this type of rare accidental is expressed as a natural, followed by a flat ({{music|natural}}{{music|b}}) to make this clear. Likewise (and more commonly), a double sharp {{music|##}} sign on a key signature with a single sharp {{music|#}} indicates only a double sharp, not a triple sharp.\n\nAssuming [[enharmonic]]ity, many accidentals will create equivalences between pitches that are written differently. For instance, raising the note B to B{{music|sharp}} is equal to the note C. Assuming all such equivalences, the complete [[chromatic scale]] adds five additional pitch classes to the original seven lettered notes for a total of 12 (the 13th note completing the [[octave]]), each separated by a half-step.\n\nNotes that belong to the [[diatonic scale]] relevant in the context are sometimes called ''[[diatonic]] notes''; notes that do not meet that criterion are then sometimes called ''[[chromatic]] notes''.\n\nAnother style of notation, rarely used in English, uses the suffix \"is\" to indicate a sharp and \"es\" (only \"s\" after A and E) for a flat, e.g., Fis for F{{music|sharp}}, Ges for G{{music|flat}}, Es for E{{music|flat}}. This system first arose in Germany and is used in almost all European countries whose main language is not English, Greek, or a [[Romance language]] (French, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Romanian)\n\nIn most countries using these suffixes, the letter H is used to represent what is B natural in English, the letter B is used instead of B{{music|flat}}, and Heses (i.e., H{{music|bb}}) is used instead of B{{music|bb}} (although Bes and Heses both denote the English B{{music|bb}}). Dutch-speakers in Belgium and the Netherlands use the same suffixes, but applied throughout to the notes A to G, so that B, B{{music|flat}} and B{{music|bb}} have the same meaning as in English, although they are called B, Bes, and Beses instead of B, B flat and B double flat. Denmark also uses H, but uses Bes instead of Heses for B{{music|bb}}.\n\n==12-tone chromatic scale==\n\nThe following chart lists the names used in different countries for the 12 notes of a [[chromatic scale]] built on C.

The traditional ([[Helmholtz pitch notation|Helmholtz]]) system centers on the great octave (with capital letters) and small octave (with lower case letters). Lower octaves are named \"contra\" (with primes before), higher ones \"lined\" (with primes after). Another system ([[Scientific pitch notation|scientific]]) suffixes a number (starting with 0, or sometimes \u22121). In this system A<sub>4</sub> is nowadays standardised at 440&nbsp;Hz, lying in the octave containing notes from C<sub>4</sub> (middle C) to B<sub>4</sub>. The lowest note on most pianos is A<sub>0</sub>, the highest C<sub>8</sub>. The [[MIDI]] system for electronic musical instruments and computers uses a straight count starting with note 0 for C<sub>\u22121</sub> at 8.1758&nbsp;Hz up to note 127 for G<sub>9</sub> at 12,544&nbsp;Hz.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+Names of octaves\n! colspan=\"4\" | Octave naming systems || rowspan=\"2\" |frequency<br />of [[A (musical note)|A]] (Hz)\n|-\n! traditional || [[Helmholtz pitch notation|Helmholtz]] || [[Scientific pitch notation|scientific]] || [[MIDI]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | subsubcontra\n| C\u0375\u0375\u0375 \u2013 B\u0375\u0375\u0375 || C<sub>\u22121</sub> \u2013 B<sub>\u22121</sub> || {{0}}0 \u2013 11 || style=\"text-align: right\" |13.75\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | sub-contra\n| C\u0375\u0375 \u2013 B\u0375\u0375 || C<sub>0</sub> \u2013 B<sub>0</sub> || 12 \u2013 23 || style=\"text-align: right\" |27.5{{0}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | contra\n| C\u0375 \u2013 B\u0375 || C<sub>1</sub> \u2013 B<sub>1</sub> || 24 \u2013 35 || style=\"text-align: right\" | 55{{0|.00}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | great\n| C \u2013 B || C<sub>2</sub> \u2013 B<sub>2</sub> || 36 \u2013 47 || style=\"text-align: right\" | 110{{0|.00}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | small\n| c \u2013 b || C<sub>3</sub> \u2013 B<sub>3</sub> || 48 \u2013 59 || style=\"text-align: right\" | 220{{0|.00}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | one-lined\n| c\u2032 \u2013 b\u2032 || C<sub>4</sub> \u2013 B<sub>4</sub> || 60 \u2013 71 || style=\"text-align: right\" | 440{{0|.00}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | two-lined\n| c\u2032\u2032 \u2013 b\u2032\u2032 || C<sub>5</sub> \u2013 B<sub>5</sub> || 72 \u2013 83 || style=\"text-align: right\" | 880{{0|.00}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | three-lined\n| c\u2032\u2032\u2032 \u2013 b\u2032\u2032\u2032 || C<sub>6</sub> \u2013 B<sub>6</sub> || 84 \u2013 95 || style=\"text-align: right\" | 1760{{0|.00}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | four-lined\n| c\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 \u2013 b\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 || C<sub>7</sub> \u2013 B<sub>7</sub> || {{0}}96 \u2013 107 || style=\"text-align: right\" | 3520{{0|.00}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | five-lined\n| c\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 \u2013 b\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 || C<sub>8</sub> \u2013 B<sub>8</sub> || 108 \u2013 119 || style=\"text-align: right\" | 7040{{0|.00}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | six-lined\n| c\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 \u2013 b\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 || C<sub>9</sub> \u2013 B<sub>9</sub> || 120 \u2013 127<br><small>C to G</small> || style=\"text-align: right\" |14080{{0|.00}}\n|}\n\n== Written notes ==\nA written note can also have a [[note value]], a code that determines the note's relative [[Duration (music)|duration]].

Since the physical causes of music are vibrations of mechanical systems, they are often measured in [[hertz]] (Hz), with 1&nbsp;Hz meaning one vibration per second. For historical and other reasons, especially in Western music, only twelve notes of fixed frequencies are used. These fixed frequencies are mathematically related to each other, and are defined around the central note, A<sub>4</sub>. The current \"standard pitch\" or modern \"[[concert pitch]]\" for this note is 440&nbsp;Hz, although this varies in actual practice (see [[Concert pitch#History of pitch standards in Western music|History of pitch standards]]).\n\nThe note-naming convention specifies a letter, any [[accidental (music)|accidentals]], and an octave number. Each note is an [[integer]] number of half-steps away from concert A (A<sub>4</sub>). Let this distance be denoted ''n''. If the note is above A<sub>4</sub>, then ''n'' is [[positive number|positive]]; if it is below A<sub>4</sub>, then ''n'' is [[negative number|negative]]. The frequency of the note (''f'') (assuming [[equal temperament]]) is then:\n:<math>f = 2^\\frac{n}{12} \\times 440 \\text{ Hz}\\,</math>\n\nFor example, one can find the frequency of C<sub>5</sub>, the first C above A<sub>4</sub>. There are 3 half-steps between A<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>5</sub> (A<sub>4</sub> \u2192 A{{music|sharp}}<sub>4</sub> \u2192 B<sub>4</sub> \u2192 C<sub>5</sub>), and the note is above A<sub>4</sub>, so ''n'' = 3. The note's frequency is:\n\n:<math>f = 2^\\frac{3}{12} \\times 440 \\text{ Hz} \\approx 523.2 \\text{ Hz}</math>\n\nTo find the frequency of a note below A4, the value of ''n'' is negative. For example, the F below A<sub>4</sub> is F<sub>4</sub>. There are 4 half-steps (A<sub>4</sub> \u2192 A{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub> \u2192 G<sub>4</sub> \u2192 G{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub> \u2192 F<sub>4</sub>), and the note is below A<sub>4</sub>, so ''n'' = \u22124. The note's frequency is:\n\n:<math>f = 2^{-\\frac{4}{12}} \\times 440 \\text{ Hz} \\approx 349.2 \\text{ Hz}</math>\n\nFinally, it can be seen from this formula that octaves automatically yield [[exponentiation|powers]] of two times the original frequency, since ''n'' is a multiple of 12 (12''k'', where ''k'' is the number of octaves up or down), and so the formula reduces to:\n\n:<math>f = 2^\\frac{12k}{12} \\times 440 \\text{ Hz} = 2^k \\times 440 \\text{ Hz}</math>\n\nyielding a [[factorization|factor]] of 2. In fact, this is the means by which this formula is derived, combined with the notion of equally-spaced [[interval (music)|intervals]].\n\nThe distance of an equally [[Musical temperament|tempered]] semitone is divided into 100 [[cent (music)|cents]]. So 1200 cents are equal to one octave \u2013 a frequency ratio of 2:1. This means that a cent is precisely equal to {{radic|2|1200}}, which is approximately {{val|1.000578}}.\n\nFor use with the [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) standard, a frequency mapping is defined by:\n\n:<math>p = 69 + 12 \\times \\log_2\\frac{f}{440 \\text{ Hz}}</math>\n\nwhere ''p'' is the MIDI note number (and 69 is the number of semitones between C<sub>\u22121</sub> (note 0) and A<sub>4</sub>). And in the opposite direction, to obtain the frequency from a MIDI note ''p'', the formula is defined as:\n\n:<math>f=2^\\frac{p-69}{12} \\times 440 \\text{ Hz}</math>\n\nFor notes in an A440 equal temperament, this formula delivers the standard MIDI note number (''p''). Any other frequencies fill the space between the whole numbers evenly. This lets MIDI instruments be tuned accurately in any microtuning scale, including non-western traditional tunings.\n\n== History of note names ==\nMusic notation systems have used letters of the [[alphabet]] for centuries. The 6th-century philosopher [[Boethius]] is known to have used the first fourteen letters of the classical [[Latin alphabet]] (the letter J did not exist until the 16th century),\n:A B C D E F G H I K L M N O,\nto signify the notes of the two-octave range that was in use at the time<ref>[[Boethius]], {{ill|Gottfried Friedlein|de}} (editor). {{IMSLP|work=De institutione musica (Bo\u00ebthius, Anicius Manlius Severinus)|cname=''De institutione musica''|descr=text}}. Book IV, chapter 14, p. 341.</ref> and in modern [[scientific pitch notation]] are represented as\n:A<sub>2</sub> B<sub>2</sub> C<sub>3</sub> D<sub>3</sub> E<sub>3</sub> F<sub>3</sub> G<sub>3</sub> A<sub>3</sub> B<sub>3</sub> C<sub>4</sub> D<sub>4</sub> E<sub>4</sub> F<sub>4</sub> G<sub>4</sub>.\n\nThough it is not known whether this was his devising or common usage at the time, this is nonetheless called ''Boethian notation''. Although Boethius is the first author known to use this nomenclature in the literature, [[Ptolemy]] wrote of the two-octave range five centuries before, calling it the ''perfect system'' or ''complete system'' \u2013 as opposed to other, smaller-range note systems that did not contain all possible species of octave (i.e., the seven octaves starting from A, B, C, D, E, F, and G).\n\nFollowing this, the range (or compass) of used notes was extended to three octaves, and the system of repeating letters A\u2013G in each octave was introduced, these being written as [[lower-case]] for the second octave (a\u2013g) and double lower-case letters for the third (aa\u2013gg). When the range was extended down by one note, to a G, that note was denoted using the Greek letter [[gamma]] (\u0393). (It is from this that the French word for scale, ''gamme'' derives, and the English word [[hexachord|gamut]], from \"Gamma-Ut\", the lowest note in Medieval music notation.)\n\nThe remaining five notes of the chromatic scale (the black keys on a piano keyboard) were added gradually; the first being B{{music|flat}}, since B was flattened in certain [[mode (music)|modes]] to avoid the dissonant [[tritone]] interval. This change was not always shown in notation, but when written, B{{music|flat}} (B-flat) was written as a Latin, round \"b\", and B{{music|natural}} (B-natural) a Gothic script (known as [[Blackletter]]) or \"hard-edged\" b. These evolved into the modern flat ({{music|flat}}) and natural ({{music|natural}}) symbols respectively. The sharp symbol arose from a barred b, called the \"cancelled b\".\n\nIn parts of Europe, including [[Germany]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Finland]] and [[Iceland]] (and [[Sweden]] before about 1990s), the Gothic b transformed into the letter H (possibly for ''hart'', German for ''hard'', or just because the Gothic b resembled an H). Therefore, in German music notation, H is used instead of B{{music|natural}} (B-natural), and B instead of B{{music|flat}} (B-flat). Occasionally, music written in German for international use will use H for B-natural and B<sup>b</sup> for B-flat (with a modern-script lower-case b instead of a flat sign). Since a Bes or B{{music|flat}} in Northern Europe (i.e., a B{{music|bb}} elsewhere) is both rare and unorthodox (more likely to be expressed as Heses), it is generally clear what this notation means.\n\nIn [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Flemish]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic]], [[Hebrew]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Vietnam]] notation the notes of scales are given in terms of Do\u2013Re\u2013Mi\u2013Fa\u2013Sol\u2013La\u2013Si rather than C\u2013D\u2013E\u2013F\u2013G\u2013A\u2013B. These names follow the original names reputedly given by [[Guido d'Arezzo]], who had taken them from the first syllables of the first six musical phrases of a [[Gregorian chant]] melody \"[[Ut queant laxis]]\", which began on the appropriate scale degrees. These became the basis of the [[solf\u00e8ge]] system. \"Do\" later replaced the original \"Ut\" for ease of singing (most likely from the beginning of ''Dominus'', Lord), though \"Ut\" is still used in some places. \"Si\" or \"Ti\" was added as the seventh degree (from ''Sancte Johannes'', St. John, to whom the hymn is dedicated). The use of \"Si\" versus \"Ti\" varies regionally.\n\nThe two notation systems most commonly used today are the [[Helmholtz pitch notation]] system and the [[scientific pitch notation]] system. As shown in the table above, they both include several octaves, each starting from C rather than A. The reason is that the most commonly used scale in Western music is the [[major scale]], and the sequence C\u2013D\u2013E\u2013F\u2013G\u2013A\u2013B\u2013C (the [[C major]] scale) is the simplest example of a major scale. Indeed, it is the only major scale that can be obtained using [[natural note]]s (the white keys on the piano keyboard) and is typically the first musical scale taught in music schools.\n\nIn a newly developed system, primarily in use in the United States, notes of scales become independent of music notation. In this system the natural symbols C\u2013D\u2013E\u2013F\u2013G\u2013A\u2013B refer to the absolute notes, while the names Do\u2013Re\u2013Mi\u2013Fa\u2013So\u2013La\u2013Ti are relativized and show only the relationship between pitches, where Do is the name of the base pitch of the scale, Re is the name of the second pitch, etc. The idea of so-called movable Do, originally suggested by [[John Curwen]] in the 19th century, was fully developed and involved into a whole educational system by [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]] in the middle of the 20th century, which system is known as the [[Kod\u00e1ly method]] or Kod\u00e1ly concept.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Ghost note]]\n*[[Grace note]]\n*[[Musical tone]]\n*[[Pensato]]\n*[[Shape note]]\n*[[Universal key]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*[[Nattiez, Jean-Jacques]] (1990).

In English usage a note is also the sound itself.\n\nNotes can represent the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] and [[Duration (music)|duration]] of a sound in [[musical notation]]. A note can also represent a [[pitch class]].\n\nNotes are the building blocks of much written music: [[musical analysis#Discretization|discretizations]] of musical phenomena that facilitate performance, comprehension, and [[musical analysis|analysis]].<ref>Nattiez 1990, p. 81, note 9</ref>\n\nThe term ''note'' can be used in both generic and specific senses: one might say either \"the piece '[[Happy Birthday to You]]' begins with two notes having the same pitch\", or \"the piece begins with two repetitions of the same note\". In the former case, one uses ''note'' to refer to a specific musical event; in the latter, one uses the term to refer to a class of events sharing the same pitch. (See also: [[Key signature names and translations]].)\n\n[[File:Treble a.svg|right|250px|thumb|The note ''A'' or ''La'']]\n[[File:Cifrado americano.JPG|right|thumb|Names of some notes]]\n\nTwo notes with [[fundamental frequency|fundamental frequencies]] in a ratio equal to any integer power of two (e.g., half, twice, or four times) are perceived as very similar. Because of that, all notes with these kinds of relations can be grouped under the same [[pitch class]].\n\nIn traditional music theory, most countries in the world use the [[solf\u00e8ge]] naming convention Do\u2013Re\u2013Mi\u2013Fa\u2013Sol\u2013La\u2013Si, including for instance Italy, Portugal, Spain, France, Romania, most Latin American countries, Greece, Albania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Russia, and all the Arabic-speaking or Persian-speaking countries. However, in English- and Dutch-speaking regions, pitch classes are typically represented by the first seven letters of the Latin alphabet (A, B, C, D, E, F and G). A few European countries, including Germany, adopt an almost identical notation, in which H substitutes for B (see below for details). {{citation needed-span|date=April 2020|text=In Indian music the [[Sanskrit]] names Sa\u2013Re\u2013Ga\u2013Ma\u2013Pa\u2013Dha\u2013Ni (\u0938\u093e-\u0930\u0947-\u0917\u093e-\u092e\u093e-\u092a\u093e-\u0927\u093e-\u0928\u093f) are used, as in Telugu Sa\u2013Ri\u2013Ga\u2013Ma\u2013Pa\u2013Da\u2013Ni (\u0c38\u2013\u0c30\u0c3f\u2013\u0c17\u2013\u0c2e\u2013\u0c2a\u2013\u0c26\u2013\u0c28\u0c3f), in Tamil (\u0b9a\u2013\u0bb0\u0bbf\u2013\u0b95\u2013\u0bae\u2013\u0baa\u2013\u0ba4\u2013\u0ba8\u0bbf) and in Malayalam (\u0d38-\u0d30\u0d3f-\u0d17-\u0d2e-\u0d2a-\u0d27-\u0d28\u0d3f).}} Byzantium used the names Pa\u2013Vu\u2013Ga\u2013Di\u2013Ke\u2013Zo\u2013Ni (\u03a0\u03b1\u2014\u0392\u03bf\u03c5\u2014\u0393\u03b1\u2014\u0394\u03b9\u2014\u039a\u03b5\u2014\u0396\u03c9\u2014\u039d\u03b7).<ref>{{cite book| title=Byzantine Music in Theory and in Practice | author= Savas I. Savas | year=1965 | publisher=Hercules Press | translator=Nicholas Dufault}}</ref>\n\nThe eighth note, or [[octave]], is given the same name as the first, but has double its frequency. The name octave is also used to indicate the span between a note and another with double frequency. To differentiate two notes that have the same pitch class but fall into different octaves, the system of [[scientific pitch notation]] combines a letter name with an Arabic numeral designating a specific octave. For example, the now-standard tuning pitch for most Western music, 440&nbsp;Hz, is named a\u2032 or A4.\n\nThere are two formal systems to define each note and octave, the [[Helmholtz pitch notation]] and the [[scientific pitch notation]].\n\n== Accidentals ==\n\nLetter names are modified by the [[accidental (music)|accidentals]]. The [[sharp (music)|sharp sign]] {{music|sharp}} raises a note by a [[semitone]] or half-step, and a [[flat (music)|flat]] {{music|flat}} lowers it by the same amount. In [[Equal temperament|modern tuning]] a [[half step]] has a frequency ratio of [[Twelfth root of two|{{radic|2|12}}]], approximately 1.0595. The accidentals are written after the note name: so, for example, F{{music|sharp}} represents F-sharp, B{{music|flat}} is B-flat, and C{{music|natural}} is C natural (or C).\n[[File:frequency vs name.svg|frame|right|Frequency vs position on [[treble clef]]. Each note shown has a frequency of the previous note multiplied by {{radic|2|12}}]]\n\nAdditional accidentals are the double-sharp {{music|##}}, raising the frequency by two semitones, and double-flat {{music|bb}}, lowering it by that amount.\n\nIn musical notation, accidentals are placed before the note symbols. Systematic alterations to the seven lettered pitches in the scale can be indicated by placing the symbols in the [[key signature]], which then apply implicitly to all occurrences of corresponding notes. Explicitly noted accidentals can be used to override this effect for the remainder of a bar. A special accidental, the [[natural (music)|natural]] symbol {{music|natural}}, is used to indicate a pitch unmodified by the alterations in the key signature. Effects of key signature and local accidentals do not accumulate. If the key signature indicates G{{music|sharp}}, a local flat before a G makes it G{{music|flat}} (not G{{music|natural}}), though often this type of rare accidental is expressed as a natural, followed by a flat ({{music|natural}}{{music|b}}) to make this clear. Likewise (and more commonly), a double sharp {{music|##}} sign on a key signature with a single sharp {{music|#}} indicates only a double sharp, not a triple sharp.\n\nAssuming [[enharmonic]]ity, many accidentals will create equivalences between pitches that are written differently. For instance, raising the note B to B{{music|sharp}} is equal to the note C. Assuming all such equivalences, the complete [[chromatic scale]] adds five additional pitch classes to the original seven lettered notes for a total of 12 (the 13th note completing the [[octave]]), each separated by a half-step.\n\nNotes that belong to the [[diatonic scale]] relevant in the context are sometimes called ''[[diatonic]] notes''; notes that do not meet that criterion are then sometimes called ''[[chromatic]] notes''.\n\nAnother style of notation, rarely used in English, uses the suffix \"is\" to indicate a sharp and \"es\" (only \"s\" after A and E) for a flat, e.g., Fis for F{{music|sharp}}, Ges for G{{music|flat}}, Es for E{{music|flat}}. This system first arose in Germany and is used in almost all European countries whose main language is not English, Greek, or a [[Romance language]] (French, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Romanian)\n\nIn most countries using these suffixes, the letter H is used to represent what is B natural in English, the letter B is used instead of B{{music|flat}}, and Heses (i.e., H{{music|bb}}) is used instead of B{{music|bb}} (although Bes and Heses both denote the English B{{music|bb}}). Dutch-speakers in Belgium and the Netherlands use the same suffixes, but applied throughout to the notes A to G, so that B, B{{music|flat}} and B{{music|bb}} have the same meaning as in English, although they are called B, Bes, and Beses instead of B, B flat and B double flat. Denmark also uses H, but uses Bes instead of Heses for B{{music|bb}}.\n\n==12-tone chromatic scale==\n\nThe following chart lists the names used in different countries for the 12 notes of a [[chromatic scale]] built on C. The corresponding symbols are shown within parenthesis. Differences between German and English notation are highlighted in '''bold''' typeface. Although the English and Dutch names are different, the corresponding symbols are identical.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+Names of notes in various languages and countries\n!

Lower octaves are named \"contra\" (with primes before), higher ones \"lined\" (with primes after). Another system ([[Scientific pitch notation|scientific]]) suffixes a number (starting with 0, or sometimes \u22121).

Since the physical causes of music are vibrations of mechanical systems, they are often measured in [[hertz]] (Hz), with 1&nbsp;Hz meaning one vibration per second. For historical and other reasons, especially in Western music, only twelve notes of fixed frequencies are used. These fixed frequencies are mathematically related to each other, and are defined around the central note, A<sub>4</sub>. The current \"standard pitch\" or modern \"[[concert pitch]]\" for this note is 440&nbsp;Hz, although this varies in actual practice (see [[Concert pitch#History of pitch standards in Western music|History of pitch standards]]).\n\nThe note-naming convention specifies a letter, any [[accidental (music)|accidentals]], and an octave number. Each note is an [[integer]] number of half-steps away from concert A (A<sub>4</sub>). Let this distance be denoted ''n''. If the note is above A<sub>4</sub>, then ''n'' is [[positive number|positive]]; if it is below A<sub>4</sub>, then ''n'' is [[negative number|negative]]. The frequency of the note (''f'') (assuming [[equal temperament]]) is then:\n:<math>f = 2^\\frac{n}{12} \\times 440 \\text{ Hz}\\,</math>\n\nFor example, one can find the frequency of C<sub>5</sub>, the first C above A<sub>4</sub>. There are 3 half-steps between A<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>5</sub> (A<sub>4</sub> \u2192 A{{music|sharp}}<sub>4</sub> \u2192 B<sub>4</sub> \u2192 C<sub>5</sub>), and the note is above A<sub>4</sub>, so ''n'' = 3. The note's frequency is:\n\n:<math>f = 2^\\frac{3}{12} \\times 440 \\text{ Hz} \\approx 523.2 \\text{ Hz}</math>\n\nTo find the frequency of a note below A4, the value of ''n'' is negative. For example, the F below A<sub>4</sub> is F<sub>4</sub>. There are 4 half-steps (A<sub>4</sub> \u2192 A{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub> \u2192 G<sub>4</sub> \u2192 G{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub> \u2192 F<sub>4</sub>), and the note is below A<sub>4</sub>, so ''n'' = \u22124. The note's frequency is:\n\n:<math>f = 2^{-\\frac{4}{12}} \\times 440 \\text{ Hz} \\approx 349.2 \\text{ Hz}</math>\n\nFinally, it can be seen from this formula that octaves automatically yield [[exponentiation|powers]] of two times the original frequency, since ''n'' is a multiple of 12 (12''k'', where ''k'' is the number of octaves up or down), and so the formula reduces to:\n\n:<math>f = 2^\\frac{12k}{12} \\times 440 \\text{ Hz} = 2^k \\times 440 \\text{ Hz}</math>\n\nyielding a [[factorization|factor]] of 2. In fact, this is the means by which this formula is derived, combined with the notion of equally-spaced [[interval (music)|intervals]].\n\nThe distance of an equally [[Musical temperament|tempered]] semitone is divided into 100 [[cent (music)|cents]]. So 1200 cents are equal to one octave \u2013 a frequency ratio of 2:1. This means that a cent is precisely equal to {{radic|2|1200}}, which is approximately {{val|1.000578}}.\n\nFor use with the [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) standard, a frequency mapping is defined by:\n\n:<math>p = 69 + 12 \\times \\log_2\\frac{f}{440 \\text{ Hz}}</math>\n\nwhere ''p'' is the MIDI note number (and 69 is the number of semitones between C<sub>\u22121</sub> (note 0) and A<sub>4</sub>). And in the opposite direction, to obtain the frequency from a MIDI note ''p'', the formula is defined as:\n\n:<math>f=2^\\frac{p-69}{12} \\times 440 \\text{ Hz}</math>\n\nFor notes in an A440 equal temperament, this formula delivers the standard MIDI note number (''p''). Any other frequencies fill the space between the whole numbers evenly. This lets MIDI instruments be tuned accurately in any microtuning scale, including non-western traditional tunings.\n\n== History of note names ==\nMusic notation systems have used letters of the [[alphabet]] for centuries. The 6th-century philosopher [[Boethius]] is known to have used the first fourteen letters of the classical [[Latin alphabet]] (the letter J did not exist until the 16th century),\n:A B C D E F G H I K L M N O,\nto signify the notes of the two-octave range that was in use at the time<ref>[[Boethius]], {{ill|Gottfried Friedlein|de}} (editor). {{IMSLP|work=De institutione musica (Bo\u00ebthius, Anicius Manlius Severinus)|cname=''De institutione musica''|descr=text}}. Book IV, chapter 14, p. 341.</ref> and in modern [[scientific pitch notation]] are represented as\n:A<sub>2</sub> B<sub>2</sub> C<sub>3</sub> D<sub>3</sub> E<sub>3</sub> F<sub>3</sub> G<sub>3</sub> A<sub>3</sub> B<sub>3</sub> C<sub>4</sub> D<sub>4</sub> E<sub>4</sub> F<sub>4</sub> G<sub>4</sub>.\n\nThough it is not known whether this was his devising or common usage at the time, this is nonetheless called ''Boethian notation''. Although Boethius is the first author known to use this nomenclature in the literature, [[Ptolemy]] wrote of the two-octave range five centuries before, calling it the ''perfect system'' or ''complete system'' \u2013 as opposed to other, smaller-range note systems that did not contain all possible species of octave (i.e., the seven octaves starting from A, B, C, D, E, F, and G).\n\nFollowing this, the range (or compass) of used notes was extended to three octaves, and the system of repeating letters A\u2013G in each octave was introduced, these being written as [[lower-case]] for the second octave (a\u2013g) and double lower-case letters for the third (aa\u2013gg). When the range was extended down by one note, to a G, that note was denoted using the Greek letter [[gamma]] (\u0393). (It is from this that the French word for scale, ''gamme'' derives, and the English word [[hexachord|gamut]], from \"Gamma-Ut\", the lowest note in Medieval music notation.)\n\nThe remaining five notes of the chromatic scale (the black keys on a piano keyboard) were added gradually; the first being B{{music|flat}}, since B was flattened in certain [[mode (music)|modes]] to avoid the dissonant [[tritone]] interval. This change was not always shown in notation, but when written, B{{music|flat}} (B-flat) was written as a Latin, round \"b\", and B{{music|natural}} (B-natural) a Gothic script (known as [[Blackletter]]) or \"hard-edged\" b. These evolved into the modern flat ({{music|flat}}) and natural ({{music|natural}}) symbols respectively. The sharp symbol arose from a barred b, called the \"cancelled b\".\n\nIn parts of Europe, including [[Germany]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Finland]] and [[Iceland]] (and [[Sweden]] before about 1990s), the Gothic b transformed into the letter H (possibly for ''hart'', German for ''hard'', or just because the Gothic b resembled an H). Therefore, in German music notation, H is used instead of B{{music|natural}} (B-natural), and B instead of B{{music|flat}} (B-flat). Occasionally, music written in German for international use will use H for B-natural and B<sup>b</sup> for B-flat (with a modern-script lower-case b instead of a flat sign). Since a Bes or B{{music|flat}} in Northern Europe (i.e., a B{{music|bb}} elsewhere) is both rare and unorthodox (more likely to be expressed as Heses), it is generally clear what this notation means.\n\nIn [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Flemish]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic]], [[Hebrew]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Vietnam]] notation the notes of scales are given in terms of Do\u2013Re\u2013Mi\u2013Fa\u2013Sol\u2013La\u2013Si rather than C\u2013D\u2013E\u2013F\u2013G\u2013A\u2013B. These names follow the original names reputedly given by [[Guido d'Arezzo]], who had taken them from the first syllables of the first six musical phrases of a [[Gregorian chant]] melody \"[[Ut queant laxis]]\", which began on the appropriate scale degrees. These became the basis of the [[solf\u00e8ge]] system. \"Do\" later replaced the original \"Ut\" for ease of singing (most likely from the beginning of ''Dominus'', Lord), though \"Ut\" is still used in some places. \"Si\" or \"Ti\" was added as the seventh degree (from ''Sancte Johannes'', St. John, to whom the hymn is dedicated). The use of \"Si\" versus \"Ti\" varies regionally.\n\nThe two notation systems most commonly used today are the [[Helmholtz pitch notation]] system and the [[scientific pitch notation]] system. As shown in the table above, they both include several octaves, each starting from C rather than A. The reason is that the most commonly used scale in Western music is the [[major scale]], and the sequence C\u2013D\u2013E\u2013F\u2013G\u2013A\u2013B\u2013C (the [[C major]] scale) is the simplest example of a major scale. Indeed, it is the only major scale that can be obtained using [[natural note]]s (the white keys on the piano keyboard) and is typically the first musical scale taught in music schools.\n\nIn a newly developed system, primarily in use in the United States, notes of scales become independent of music notation. In this system the natural symbols C\u2013D\u2013E\u2013F\u2013G\u2013A\u2013B refer to the absolute notes, while the names Do\u2013Re\u2013Mi\u2013Fa\u2013So\u2013La\u2013Ti are relativized and show only the relationship between pitches, where Do is the name of the base pitch of the scale, Re is the name of the second pitch, etc. The idea of so-called movable Do, originally suggested by [[John Curwen]] in the 19th century, was fully developed and involved into a whole educational system by [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]] in the middle of the 20th century, which system is known as the [[Kod\u00e1ly method]] or Kod\u00e1ly concept.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Ghost note]]\n*[[Grace note]]\n*[[Musical tone]]\n*[[Pensato]]\n*[[Shape note]]\n*[[Universal key]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*[[Nattiez, Jean-Jacques]] (1990).

An assortment of special items can be located in each level that increase the player's character's health, unlock doors, gain more points, and give magical potions that can destroy all of the enemies on screen.<ref name=\"moby\">{{MobyGames|id=/gauntlet|name=''Gauntlet''}}</ref>\n\nEach player controls one of four playable fantasy-based characters: Thor, a [[Barbarian|warrior]]; Merlin, a [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]]; Thyra, a [[valkyrie]]; or Questor, an [[Elf]]. The characters are named on the cabinet artwork, but in-game they are referred only by the title of their classes. Each character has his or her own unique strengths and weaknesses. For example, the warrior is strongest in hand-to-hand combat, the wizard has the most powerful magic, the valkyrie has the best armor, and the Elf is the fastest in movement.<ref name=ahistory/> The characters are assigned by control panel in the four-player version, whereas in the two-player version each player selects his or her own character at the start of the game or while joining during the middle of play.\n\nThe enemies are an assortment of fantasy-based monsters, including ghosts, grunts, demons, lobbers, sorcerers, and [[Thief (character class)|thieves]]. Each enters the level through specific generators, which can be destroyed. While there are no [[boss (video games)|bosses]] in the game, the most dangerous enemy is [[Death (personification)|Death]], who can only be destroyed by using a magic potion\u2014otherwise Death will vanish automatically after it has drained a certain amount of health from the player.<ref name=\"moby\"/>\n\nAs the game progresses, higher levels of skill are needed to reach the exit, with success often depending on the willingness of the players to cooperate by sharing food and luring monsters into places where they can be engaged and slaughtered more conveniently.<ref name=\"moby\"/> While contact with enemies reduces the player's health, health also slowly drains on its own, thus creating a time limit. When a character's health reaches zero, that character dies. The character can be revived in place with full health by spending a game credit\u2014inserting a coin in the arcade\u2014within a certain short time window after it died. This allows even the least proficient players to keep playing indefinitely, if they are willing to keep inserting coins. However, each player's final score will be divided by the amount of credits they used to play, resulting in an average.\n\nAside from the ability to have up to four players at once, the game is also noted for the narrator's voice, which is produced by a [[Texas Instruments LPC Speech Chips|Texas Instruments TMS5220C speech chip]].<ref name=gdc2012_slides/><ref name=\"moby\"/> The TMS5220C speech was encoded by Earl Vickers.<ref name=gdc2012_slides/> The narrator (voiced by [[Ernie Fosselius]])<ref name=gdc2012_slides/> frequently makes statements repeating the game's rules, including: \"Shots do not hurt other players, yet\", \"Remember, don't shoot food\", \"Elf shot the food\", and \"Warrior needs food, badly\". The narrator occasionally comments on the battle by saying, \"I've not seen such bravery\" or \"Let's see you get out of here\". When a player's life force points fall below 200, the narrator states, \"Your life force is running out\", \"Elf needs food\", or \"Valkyrie is about to die\".\n\nThe control panel for the four-player cabinet is wider than other standard uprights in order to accommodate four people at the same time. Each player has an eight-way [[joystick]] and two buttons: one for \"fire\" (ranged attack) and one for \"magic\". The \"magic\" button also starts the game. After ''Gauntlet''{{'}}s release, other games started using this design, so it was a popular conversion target for newer games after it had its run.\n\n==Development==\nOriginally called ''Dungeons'',<ref name=gdc2012_slides/> the game was conceived by Atari game designer Ed Logg.  He claimed inspiration from his son's interest in the paper-based game ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' and from his own interest in the 1984 four-player dungeon crawl for the [[Atari 8-bit family]],  ''[[Dandy (video game)|Dandy]]''.\n\nThe game's development spanned from 1983 to 1985, with a team being led by designers Ed Logg and Roger Zeigler.  The working title became legally unavailable in April 1985,<ref name=gdc2012_slides/> so it was renamed ''Gauntlet'' in May.  Based upon some of the most elaborate hardware design in Atari's history to date, it is the company's first coin-operated game that features a voice synthesizer chip.<ref name=\"Making of Gauntlet, G4TV\">{{cite web | title=The Making Of Gauntlet -- A Classic Arcade Game That Atari Never Saw Coming | date=March 8, 2012 | first=Dennis | last=Scimeca | publisher=G4TV | url=http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/721573/the-making-of-gauntlet-a-classic-arcade-game-that-atari-never-saw-coming/ | accessdate=November 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===''Dandy'' dispute===\n[[Ed Logg]], the co-creator of ''[[Asteroids (arcade game)|Asteroids]]'' and ''[[Centipede (arcade game)|Centipede]]'', is credited with the original game design of ''Gauntlet'' in the arcade version, as well as the 1987 NES release.

An assortment of special items can be located in each level that increase the player's character's health, unlock doors, gain more points, and give magical potions that can destroy all of the enemies on screen.<ref name=\"moby\">{{MobyGames|id=/gauntlet|name=''Gauntlet''}}</ref>\n\nEach player controls one of four playable fantasy-based characters: Thor, a [[Barbarian|warrior]]; Merlin, a [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]]; Thyra, a [[valkyrie]]; or Questor, an [[Elf]]. The characters are named on the cabinet artwork, but in-game they are referred only by the title of their classes. Each character has his or her own unique strengths and weaknesses. For example, the warrior is strongest in hand-to-hand combat, the wizard has the most powerful magic, the valkyrie has the best armor, and the Elf is the fastest in movement.<ref name=ahistory/> The characters are assigned by control panel in the four-player version, whereas in the two-player version each player selects his or her own character at the start of the game or while joining during the middle of play.\n\nThe enemies are an assortment of fantasy-based monsters, including ghosts, grunts, demons, lobbers, sorcerers, and [[Thief (character class)|thieves]]. Each enters the level through specific generators, which can be destroyed. While there are no [[boss (video games)|bosses]] in the game, the most dangerous enemy is [[Death (personification)|Death]], who can only be destroyed by using a magic potion\u2014otherwise Death will vanish automatically after it has drained a certain amount of health from the player.<ref name=\"moby\"/>\n\nAs the game progresses, higher levels of skill are needed to reach the exit, with success often depending on the willingness of the players to cooperate by sharing food and luring monsters into places where they can be engaged and slaughtered more conveniently.<ref name=\"moby\"/> While contact with enemies reduces the player's health, health also slowly drains on its own, thus creating a time limit. When a character's health reaches zero, that character dies. The character can be revived in place with full health by spending a game credit\u2014inserting a coin in the arcade\u2014within a certain short time window after it died. This allows even the least proficient players to keep playing indefinitely, if they are willing to keep inserting coins. However, each player's final score will be divided by the amount of credits they used to play, resulting in an average.\n\nAside from the ability to have up to four players at once, the game is also noted for the narrator's voice, which is produced by a [[Texas Instruments LPC Speech Chips|Texas Instruments TMS5220C speech chip]].<ref name=gdc2012_slides/><ref name=\"moby\"/> The TMS5220C speech was encoded by Earl Vickers.<ref name=gdc2012_slides/> The narrator (voiced by [[Ernie Fosselius]])<ref name=gdc2012_slides/> frequently makes statements repeating the game's rules, including: \"Shots do not hurt other players, yet\", \"Remember, don't shoot food\", \"Elf shot the food\", and \"Warrior needs food, badly\". The narrator occasionally comments on the battle by saying, \"I've not seen such bravery\" or \"Let's see you get out of here\". When a player's life force points fall below 200, the narrator states, \"Your life force is running out\", \"Elf needs food\", or \"Valkyrie is about to die\".\n\nThe control panel for the four-player cabinet is wider than other standard uprights in order to accommodate four people at the same time. Each player has an eight-way [[joystick]] and two buttons: one for \"fire\" (ranged attack) and one for \"magic\". The \"magic\" button also starts the game. After ''Gauntlet''{{'}}s release, other games started using this design, so it was a popular conversion target for newer games after it had its run.\n\n==Development==\nOriginally called ''Dungeons'',<ref name=gdc2012_slides/> the game was conceived by Atari game designer Ed Logg.  He claimed inspiration from his son's interest in the paper-based game ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' and from his own interest in the 1984 four-player dungeon crawl for the [[Atari 8-bit family]],  ''[[Dandy (video game)|Dandy]]''.\n\nThe game's development spanned from 1983 to 1985, with a team being led by designers Ed Logg and Roger Zeigler.  The working title became legally unavailable in April 1985,<ref name=gdc2012_slides/> so it was renamed ''Gauntlet'' in May.
