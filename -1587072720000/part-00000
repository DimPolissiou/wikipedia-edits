After an altercation in which he killed [[Sheriff]] W.T.(Brack) Morris, Cortez went on the run from the Texas Rangers for thirteen days. He became the target of the largest manhunt in U.S. history from June 14, 1901 to June 22, 1901. He was accused of murdering two sheriffs and finally convicted of horse theft.<ref>{{harvnb|Alvear|2006|page= 1}}</ref>\n\nCelebrated by fellow Mexican-Americans for his ability to evade the authorities, as well as his impassioned words in court, Cortez's life was converted into a [[legend]] by people on the [[Rio Grande]] border.<ref name=\"rodriguez\">{{harvnb|Rodr\u00edguez}}</ref> This legend, which took shape in a popular song, the \"Corrido de Gregorio Cortez,\" dramatized Cortez's fight against the authorities and transformed him into an inspiration for the [[Mexican-American border]] communities. This [[corrido]] (or [[border ballad]]), sung at local cantinas, resonated with its listeners, and ignited pride in one's way of life on the border. The conversion of Cortez into myth was analyzed by [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in his book ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', which examines the many versions of this corrido as well as the story's historical basis in order to understand how an average man such as Gregorio Cortez was canonized into a folkloric hero inspiring the border resident. Cortez's story was also depicted in the movie ''[[The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez]]'', starring [[Edward James Olmos]].\n\n==Background==\n\nTexas was part of newly independent Mexico from 1821 until 1836 when it declared its independence. The annexation by the United States was approved by the congresses of Texas and the United States in 1845, and the transfer of authority from the republic to the state of Texas took place in 1846. However, Mexico's rejection of this annexation and a disagreement over the location of the new border, namely, a dispute over the area comprised between [[the Rio Grande]] and the [[Nueces River]], led to the [[Mexican-American War]]. In the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], signed on February 2, 1848, Mexico gave up its claim to [[Texas]] and the new border between Mexico and The United States was settled along the [[Rio Grande]].<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2003|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. annexation brought land loss and limitations to political access for Tejanos. The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] promised American citizenship to residents who wanted to stay in Texas, but Tejanos in the lower Rio Grande Valley were relegated to second-class status. Also, while it provided that the property rights of Mexican subjects would be maintained inviolable, these rights were later challenged by the United States authorities. <ref name= Valerio-Jimenez2012> Valerio-Jim\u00e9nez, Omar S., and e-Duke Books Scholarly Collection 2012.

Indeed, cultural, ethnic, and religious differences between Anglos and Hispanics persisted in the decades after the Mexican War.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 36}}</ref> Although the episodes of ethnic violence were episodic,<ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 133}}</ref> the historian Alonzo argues that \"Anglo superiority also served to rationalize the very common idea in Texas that it is no wrong to kill a Mexican and, worse still, that killing an ethnic Mexican was an act to be proud of.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 134}}</ref>\n\nIn his book about Gregorio Cortez's life, Am\u00e9rico Paredes highlights the role of the Texas Rangers division in exacerbating the cultural conflicts on the border due to their alleged violent methods.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|pages= 23-32}}</ref>. An antagonistic relationship between [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican-Americans]] has developed in Texas due to a cycle of revenge involving Bandit Gang, Texas Rangers and innocent [[Mexican-Americans]] collaterals victims.<ref>{{harvnb|Levario|2012|page= 18}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 132}}</ref> However, the role of the Texas Rangers in discrimination is a subject of historical controversy. On the one hand, the Texas Rangers were portrayed as heroic figures protecting settlers from Indian raids and Mexican banditry. On the other hand, they have been described as the main tool of [[Anglo]] expansion on lands formerly occupied by Mexicans and Native Americans.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 41}}</ref> To move beyond this dichotomy, historian Robert M. Utley exposes the complex nature of the relationship between the [[Mexican Americans]] and the Texas Rangers. While some rangers may have been \"ruthless, brutal and more lawless than the criminals they were prosecuting,\" he argues that there is no systematic evidence of persecution of Mexican-Americans by this police force <ref>Utley, page xii</ref>.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nGregorio Cortez Lira was born in the state of [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>, near the U.S.-Mexico border, the son of Roman Cortez Garza, a rancher, and Rosalia Lira Cortinas. Cortez and his first wife divorced in 1903, and in 1905 he married Estefana Garza<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>. They had no children and later separated.<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>\n\nIn 1887, his family moved to [[Manor, Texas]] near [[Austin]]. Two years later, Cortez joined his older brother, Romaldo Cortez, in finding seasonal employment on the farms and ranches of South Texas. Eventually, Cortez married Leonor D\u00edaz; they had four children. After eleven years as ''vaqueros'', or cowboys, and farmhands, Cortez and his brother settled on a farm in [[Karnes County]], renting land from a local rancher. It is known that he spoke [[English language|English]] and owned horses.<ref name=\"orozco\" />\n\nAt the time that Cortez and his family had immigrated to South Texas, [[Anglo]]s had also begun to penetrate the region in increasing numbers, particularly with the arrival of the railroad. As political and economic power shifted to the newcomers, most Mexican Americans, like Cortez, lived as hired agricultural workers or as tenant farmers. Class and ethnicity relegated them to the bottom of a discriminatory Anglo-dominated Texas society.<ref name= \"jastrzembski\">{{harvnb|Jastrzembski|2000}}</ref>\n\n== Adventure of Cortez ==\n\n=== Incident ===\nThe visit to Cortez followed their interrogation of Villareal in connection with a reported [[horse theft]]. Villareal had already acknowledged his recent trade of a horse for a [[mare]] belonging to Gregorio Cortez. And it was exactly this distinction made in Spanish, between a male horse (''caballo'') and a female horse or mare (''yegua''), that Choate misunderstood when questioning Gregorio. The latter answered negatively when asked on behalf of the Sheriff whether he had recently traded for a horse. For, in truth, he had traded a mare.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nCourt records show that the killings of Romaldo (also known as Rom\u00e1n) Cortez, Gregorio's brother, and [[Sheriff]] W.T. (Brack) Morris were related to the subject of a horse trade.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref> Morris arrived accompanied by one of his [[deputies]], Boone Choate, who could speak Spanish and would thus serve as an interpreter.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref>\n\nInterpreting the response as a lie, the Sheriff made clear his intention to arrest the Cortez brothers. More words were exchanged and a gun battle followed. The sheriff was the first to draw a pistol despite the suspicion on his part that both Cortezes were probably unarmed. Gregorio killed Sheriff Morris in [[self-defense]] after the Sheriff had fired repeatedly on his brother Romaldo who, thinking that Gregorio was unarmed, ran at the Sheriff trying to protect Gregorio.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe Sheriff shot Romaldo and he fell away from the door. And then Gregorio Cortez stood at the door with his pistol in his hand. The Major Sheriff fell dead at the feet of Gregorio Cortez, and it was in this way that Gregorio Cortez killed the first sheriff of many that he was to kill.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 40}}</ref>\nThe killing occurred on June 14, 1901.<ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\n=== Escape to the Robledo ranch ===\n\nAfter the run-in with [[Sheriff]] Morris and [[Sheriffs in the United States|Deputy]] Boone, Cortez wanted to take his injured brother to the closest town, [[Kenedy, Texas]], for medical assistance about 10 miles away. Both on [[horseback]], Cortez and his brother, Romaldo, struggled on their journey as Romaldo was severely hurt and kept falling off his horse. However, Gregorio eventually reached [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy,]] left Romaldo in town to be taken care of, and began his flight from the authorities.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 66}}</ref> \n\nAs officers thought Cortez would be heading south to the border to escape, he decided to head north instead to confuse his pursuers. <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> He traveled 55 miles from [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy]] to [[Belmont, Texas|Belmont]] in hopes of hiding at the house of his friend, Mart\u00edn Robledo. After spending a couple of days at the Robledo ranch, authorities discovered Cortez's whereabouts and thus begun the Battle of Belmont.\n\n=== Battle of Belmont ===\nAfter escaping, Cortez went to the ranch of Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo near [[Belmont, Texas]]. There were seven persons at the Robledo house. Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo, their three sons, Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (a boy living with the Robledos) and a visitor, Mart\u00edn Sandoval. Gonzales County Sheriff Robert M. Glover, a friend of Sheriff Morris, knew where Cortez was hiding, probably from information obtained under duress. This information would have been either provided by Cortez's mother, wife or sister-in-law as they were the only people who knew where Cortez was going.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals report of facts, on June 15, 1904, at the time Sheriff Morris was killed, Sheriff Glover was in [[Cuero]], [[DeWitt County, Texas]]. Glover proceeded with a [[deputy sheriff]] of De Witt County to Kennedy, in [[Karnes County]], and there for the first time learned that Cortez was the man who had killed Sheriff Morris. Glover, knowing the rendezvous of Cortez, boarded a train in about twenty minutes after receiving the information that Cortez had done the killing and proceeded as expeditiously as he could to the town of Ottine, in Gonzales County; there secured horses, and accompanied by two deputy sheriffs of [[Gonzales County]], including Deputy Swift, and other parties, went a few miles in the country to the Schnable ranch; and there learned that Cortez was at the home of Martin Roblero. He and his posse went to Roblero's. The posse divided as they approached the house from the north side; Glover and one or more companions going on the east side of the house around to the south side; and the other parties going on the west side around to the south side of the house. According to the Court, Some of the testimony tends to show that the sheriff's posse shot first; but the preponderance of the evidence shows that Cortez and Bonafacio fired the first shot. Just before the time that the sheriff's posse arrived at the house, Cortez informed Bonafacio that the Sheriff's troop would be on his tail and asked him what he should do, whether to fight or surrender. Bonafacio would have said, \"We will fight\". Immediately upon Glover getting around to a point opposite the gallery on the south side of the house, Cortez and Bonafacio Roblero (the Roblero's eldest son), who were in the gallery, allegedly fired upon Glover and killed him. There was a general fusillade of shots on the part of the posse and Cortez and Bonafacio. On the other hand, in his testimony, Cortez asserts that the officers came up and immediately fired upon him; that he returned this fire. <ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\nThe San-Antonio Express called the Battle of Belmont, as it came to be known, \u201ca tale of bravery unsurpassed on the part of the officers and of desperation on the part of the Mexicans.\u201d. According to this version of the story, Cortez was waiting in ambush, and as Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel approached, he opened fire. Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel were killed <ref>San Antonio Express, June 16, 1901</ref>\n\nThe actual story, according to the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]], was less heroic. Just hours after Cortez arrived at the ranch, Glover and his posse had surrounded the house and began to attack. Cortez fired at Glover who fell dead before running into the brush behind the house to hide. Robledo, his eldest son, and Sandoval were involved in the shooting, while Robledo's wife, his two younger sons and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez stayed unarmed inside the house. Shots were exchanged and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez was wounded, as well as Robledo\u2019s wife. Another member of the posse shot and killed accidentally his companion, Henry Schnabel. In the end, the posse captured five of the Mexicans, including the two wounded. Cortez, however, escaped.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\n=== Flight ===\n\nAfter narrowly escaping the [[Mexican standoff|standoff]] on the Robledo [[ranch]], Cortez \"walked directly south to the [[Bank (geography)|banks]] of the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]] [...] to another friend, Ceferino Flores.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 72}}</ref> Flores gave Cortez a horse and saddle to continue his journey. Cortez would frequently ride in circles and create paths in different directions to throw off the authorities. After days of travel, the [[mare]] grew weary and dropped dead. Soon saddling another small horse, Cortez continued south, just outside of [[Floresville, Texas|Floresville,]] close to [[Cotulla]]. Though Cortez succeeded in creating disorientating routes for officers to follow, he traveled close to the Corpus Christi-to-Laredo [[railroad]] and made it evident that he was moving toward [[Laredo\u2013Nuevo Laredo|Laredo]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> As the law was close behind him, Cortez took risks; having his newfound horse jump over sharp wire fences or pretending he was a [[cattle]] [[herder]]. But on June 20, as the mare could not continue, Cortez left the horse and snuck into [[Cotulla]] and received food and new clothes from locals. Cortez did not have a horse and was essentially surrounded by authorities. However, he went unnoticed, authorities believed he had acquired yet another horse, and that their only chance of catching Cortez would be by accident. Over his 10 day journey, Cortez had ridden three horses, traveled over 500 hundred miles, and had seemingly blended in with the townspeople of [[Cotulla]] <ref name= SanAntonio2016> [https://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/commentary/article/Gregorio-Cortez-the-myth-and-the-man-7420445.php L\u00f3pez, Jos\u00e9 A. \"Gregorio Cortez, the myth and the man.\" ''San Antonio Express-News,'' 7 May 2016.] </ref>.\n\nDuring those 10 days, Cortez was pursued by a posse that at times included up to 300 men. He traveled nearly 400 miles on horseback and more than 100 miles on foot. His story was symbolic of the struggles between the [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican Americans]] in [[South Texas]].<ref>Afterword by Bill Crider. Elmer Kelton. ''Manhunters''. Texas Christian University Press, 1994</ref>\n\n=== Capture ===\n\nGregorio managed to elude hundreds of men in parties of up to three hundred by riding four hundred miles on mares and walking at least 120 miles along the [[Mexico-Texas border]] before ultimately being captured on June 22.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nSuspecting Gregorio\u2019s presence nearby, Glover and eight other Rangers approached the Martin Robledo home at dawn after drinking a bottle of whiskey together. He divided his posse to the east and west sides to surround the house. With the confusion from the alcohol and darkness of night, the shooting began as Glover reached the southeast corner of the home. Glover and Gregorio fired at each other until Glover fell dead from his horse. With two lawmen dead, an extensive manhunt began for Gregorio. The [[Texas Ranger Division]] became involved when the sheriff of [[Atascosa County]] and Ranger Robert M. Glover were shot on the Thulemeyer ranch. \n\nFrom June 15 to June 25, 1901, the story was front-page news of the [[Daily Express]]. Through the newspaper, Cortez, a lone Mexican vaquero, was transformed into a dynamic leader of well-organized thieves. While the [[Euro-American]] public viewed Cortez as a guilty Mexican, Mexican-Americans transformed Cortez into a heroic figure that could outrun the renowned Texas Rangers, and stand up to his oppressors.<ref>Alvear, 28</ref>\n\n== Trials ==\n=== Court proceedings ===\n\n==== Supporters ====\n\nAfter the capture of Cortez, before court proceedings would begin, [[Mexican-Americans]] across the country started a defense fund for Cortez, saying that without the support it would be impossible for him to get a fair trial <ref name= GarberCourts />. The amount of money raised is unknown, however, the fund was largely advertised by a newspaper publisher, Pablo Cruz, and the Sociedad Trabajador Miguel Hidalgo in [[San Antonio]] and saw donations flood in from rich landowners and even local \"rancheros\".<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though Cortez's support was mainly from those of Mexican descent, some [[Anglo-Americans]] admired his \"intellect, wisdom and ingenuity <ref name= SanAntonio2016 />. Some prominent Anglo-Texans aiding Cortez were then [[Texas Secretary of State]], F.C. Weinert, and [[defense lawyer]], R.B Abernathy, who Cortez remembered as one of his most vital attorneys, defending him for over four years <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />.\n\n==== Gonzales trial ====\nThe first of Cortez's trials began on July 24, 1901, in [[Gonzales, Texas]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though many [[Mexicans]] were vocal about and attended the [[trial]] in Gonzales, the [[jury]] consisted of eleven [[Anglo-Americans]] and one [[African-American]]. At Gonzales, \"a gallery full of lawmen filled the courtroom\" <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> and wanted to see Cortez sentenced. The [[prosecution]] tried Cortez for the murder of [[Constable]] Schnabel, one of the men killed at the Battle of Belmont (see above) <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. The prosecution had originally claimed the murder to have been done by Mrs. Robledo during the fight, but they shifted the blame to Cortez and told Robledo to testify that she had seen Cortez shoot and kill both Schnabel and Glover<ref name= Algren1997>Algren, Nelson. ''The Last Carousel''. New York, Seven Stories Press, 1997. </ref>. Another [[witness]], Manuel Tom, strengthened the claim, saying that Cortez had confessed to him about killing the two men near a [[barn]] where Robledo described. However, when asked what was the Spanish word for barn (granero) the best Tom could do was say ''casa'', the word for house <ref name= CortezAppeals1902> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2731/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04-Appeals-Challenge-Convictions.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Appeals Challenge Convictions.]</ref>. The trial swayed all jurors, besides an A.L Sanders who believed Cortez to be innocent. However, as a family member of Sanders's soon developed a serious illness and the juror needed to return home. Sanders succumbed to the jury's pressure and agreed with the others that Cortez was guilty; ultimately sentencing Cortez to 50 years in prison for [[second-degree murder]] <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) /> <ref>Paredes 91</ref>. Though Sanders later told the defense he voted \"guilty\" to be there for his sick family member and the attorneys motioned for a new trial, however, their plea was struck down and Sanders was fined $100 for [[contempt of court]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 91}}</ref>\n\nMany local officers were enraged about the [[verdict]] as they wanted to see Cortez face the [[death penalty]]. A few months later, as Cortez was in a Gonzales jail, over 300 men arranged a [[lynching]] of the recently sentenced prisoner <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2)> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2733/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Convictions Upheld In Glover Shooting] </ref>. The hate-filled attempts were unsuccessful, but tensions grew further as soon thereafter, on January 15, 1902, the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed Cortez's sentence <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. The appeal was upheld as the court doubted that Cortez could have murdered both officers within quick succession, as he would have been in two places at the same time, and denied Manuel Tom's crude translation of the word ''barn'' <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. The Gonzales Trial was ultimately a win for Cortez and his defense team, as he would not be tried for the murder of Schnabel again. However, the prosecution backed by the rage of local police forces continued working to see Cortez serve life behind bars or be sentenced to death.\n\n==== Further legal battles ====\nThough Cortez's sentence for the killing of Schnabel was reversed in early 1902 <ref name=GarberCourts> Garber, Margorie B.; Matlock, Jann; Walkowitz, Rebecca (1993). Media Spectacles. New York: Routledge. pp. 91\u2013116.</ref>, Cortez had faced a previous trial from Oct 7-11, 1901 in [[Karnes City, Texas]] and was sentenced to death for the murder of Sherrif Morris <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. At this trial, \"the families of both Morris and Glover were sat in the front row, where the prosecution could point them out to the jury.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 92}}</ref> However, eight months after the Karnes verdict, the [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed the sentence on the grounds of [[prejudice]] <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. Legal proceedings transferred to [[Pleasanton, Texas]] where a ruling emprisoned Cortez for two years for [[horse theft]]. The court ruling was soon reversed.<ref>Brown 146</ref>\n\nCortez's hearings continued to [[Goliad, Texas]] where the jury could not agree on a sentence for Cortez with \"seven for first-degree murder, four for second-degree murder, and one for acquittal.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 93}}</ref> The trials soon went to [[Wharton County]], where it was dismissed almost immediately, and then to Corpus Christi where Cortez was tried April 25-30, 1904. The jury, consisting of twelve white farmers, found Cortez not guilty for the killing of Morris; saying he acted in [[self-defense]].<ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />\n\nHowever, there was no celebration of the [[acquittal]], as soon thereafter, a court in [[Columbus, Texas]] found Cortez guilty for the murder of Sheriff Glover and sentenced him to life in prison <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though the defense was optimistic about their [[appeal]] being upheld, Cortez's lawyers had built a case saying that Cortez had not fired shots anywhere near Glover in the Battle of Belmont which many witnesses denied.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 94}}</ref>. The [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] soon upheld the [[conviction]], and on Jan 1, 1905, Gregorio Cortez began his [[life sentence]] in the [[Huntsville Penitentiary]] for the murder of Sheriff Glover.<ref name= TexasAppeals>[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4148411/cortez-v-state/ Cortez v.

Glover, who was killed during the pursuit. Efforts to have Cortez pardoned began with his incarceration and finally succeeded in 1913 when Governor [[Oscar Branch Colquitt|Oscar Colquitt]] issued him a conditional [[pardon]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> He was freed on July 14 of that year.\n\n== Post-prison life and death ==\n\nAfter his pardon in 1913, Cortez thanked those who helped secure his freedom, spent his later years in [[Nuevo Laredo, Mexico]], and joined the losing [[Victoriano Huerta|Huertist]] forces of the [[Mexican Revolution]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> After being wounded in the war, Cortez began living with one of his sons in [[Manor, Texas]] then later resided in [[Anson, Texas]].<ref>Brown, 150</ref><ref name= Deutsch2012>[https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/19510/cfch_Deutsch_GregorioCortez.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y Deutsch, James I. 2012. \"Gregorio Cortez.\" in Great Lives from History: Latinos.]</ref>.

The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.P64</ref> <ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> The magazine ''Cin\u00e9aste'' described the film as \"the true history of the West\".<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> and the movie has been considered the most authentic Westerns in the history of American cinema by the United States Historical Society <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p64</ref>. This sense of authenticity is due in part to the documentary-style used by the director to tell the life of Gregorio Cortez, but also to the choice made by Villasenor to develop the point of view of the people involved in the story, regardless of their ethnicity, thus presenting real historical characters and not the stereotypes of a myth. This process makes it possible to represent the hostility between communities in South Texas and the violation of the land rights of Mexican Americans by Texas Rangers or lynch mobs <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018. p65</ref>. On the other hand, through this process, the scriptwriters were able to highlight the origins of the myth as well as the stages of its construction. The myth is presented as an episode in the history of the conflict between the Anglo-Americans and The Mexican-Americans.<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref>\n\nIn an interview, the film's director, [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], suggested that he wanted to represent the different interpretations surrounding life and legend. He declared \"I thought the important thing was, first, to tell a story that wasn't linear- I don't believe in those kinds of stories, things are always more complicated - and then to deal with the differing interpretations.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref> Young wanted to represent the fantasies created by the two ethnic groups, namely the exaggeration of Cortez's exploits for the Mexicans and the belief that Cortez was at the head of an entire gang for the Anglos. He declared to the Cin\u00e9aste that he \" tried to take the audience into the story so they would make the same mistakes as the Anglos and, later, when they find out what happened, they wouldn't feel superior to the Anglo characters but realize that they'd made the same error\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>.\n\nIf racism is portrayed throughout the film, the director downplays it. It was a deliberate choice to keep the humanity of the characters and to denounce it more vigorously. According to Young, \"The people who perpetuate the racism are people, too, they're human. If you go too heavy on the racism, it makes it difficult to see them as people.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Juan Cortina]]\n* [[Joaquin Murietta]]\n* [[Tiburcio Vasquez]]\n* [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]]\n* [[Manifest Destiny]]\n* [[Texas Ranger Division]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}} \n\n== Sources ==\n* {{citation|last= Alonzo |first= A.

After an altercation in which he killed [[Sheriff]] W.T.(Brack) Morris, Cortez went on the run from the Texas Rangers for thirteen days. He became the target of the largest manhunt in U.S. history from June 14, 1901 to June 22, 1901. He was accused of murdering two sheriffs and finally convicted of horse theft.<ref>{{harvnb|Alvear|2006|page= 1}}</ref>\n\nCelebrated by fellow Mexican-Americans for his ability to evade the authorities, as well as his impassioned words in court, Cortez's life was converted into a [[legend]] by people on the [[Rio Grande]] border.<ref name=\"rodriguez\">{{harvnb|Rodr\u00edguez}}</ref> This legend, which took shape in a popular song, the \"Corrido de Gregorio Cortez,\" dramatized Cortez's fight against the authorities and transformed him into an inspiration for the [[Mexican-American border]] communities. This [[corrido]] (or [[border ballad]]), sung at local cantinas, resonated with its listeners, and ignited pride in one's way of life on the border. The conversion of Cortez into myth was analyzed by [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in his book ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', which examines the many versions of this corrido as well as the story's historical basis in order to understand how an average man such as Gregorio Cortez was canonized into a folkloric hero inspiring the border resident. Cortez's story was also depicted in the movie ''[[The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez]]'', starring [[Edward James Olmos]].\n\n==Background==\n\nTexas was part of newly independent Mexico from 1821 until 1836 when it declared its independence. The annexation by the United States was approved by the congresses of Texas and the United States in 1845, and the transfer of authority from the republic to the state of Texas took place in 1846. However, Mexico's rejection of this annexation and a disagreement over the location of the new border, namely, a dispute over the area comprised between [[the Rio Grande]] and the [[Nueces River]], led to the [[Mexican-American War]]. In the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], signed on February 2, 1848, Mexico gave up its claim to [[Texas]] and the new border between Mexico and The United States was settled along the [[Rio Grande]].<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2003|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. annexation brought land loss and limitations to political access for Tejanos. The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] promised American citizenship to residents who wanted to stay in Texas, but Tejanos in the lower Rio Grande Valley were relegated to second-class status. Also, while it provided that the property rights of Mexican subjects would be maintained inviolable, these rights were later challenged by the United States authorities. <ref name= Valerio-Jimenez2012> Valerio-Jim\u00e9nez, Omar S., and e-Duke Books Scholarly Collection 2012. River of Hope: Forging Identity and Nation in the Rio Grande Borderlands. Duke University Press, Durham, NC, 2013;2012;.</ref> The vast majority of [[Mexican-Americans]] also suffered racial discrimination. Indeed, cultural, ethnic, and religious differences between Anglos and Hispanics persisted in the decades after the Mexican War.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 36}}</ref> Although the episodes of ethnic violence were episodic,<ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 133}}</ref> the historian Alonzo argues that \"Anglo superiority also served to rationalize the very common idea in Texas that it is no wrong to kill a Mexican and, worse still, that killing an ethnic Mexican was an act to be proud of.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 134}}</ref>\n\nIn his book about Gregorio Cortez's life, Am\u00e9rico Paredes highlights the role of the Texas Rangers division in exacerbating the cultural conflicts on the border due to their alleged violent methods.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|pages= 23-32}}</ref>. An antagonistic relationship between [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican-Americans]] has developed in Texas due to a cycle of revenge involving Bandit Gang, Texas Rangers and innocent [[Mexican-Americans]] collaterals victims.<ref>{{harvnb|Levario|2012|page= 18}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 132}}</ref> However, the role of the Texas Rangers in discrimination is a subject of historical controversy. On the one hand, the Texas Rangers were portrayed as heroic figures protecting settlers from Indian raids and Mexican banditry. On the other hand, they have been described as the main tool of [[Anglo]] expansion on lands formerly occupied by Mexicans and Native Americans.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 41}}</ref> To move beyond this dichotomy, historian Robert M. Utley exposes the complex nature of the relationship between the [[Mexican Americans]] and the Texas Rangers. While some rangers may have been \"ruthless, brutal and more lawless than the criminals they were prosecuting,\" he argues that there is no systematic evidence of persecution of Mexican-Americans by this police force <ref>Utley, page xii</ref>.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nGregorio Cortez Lira was born in the state of [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>, near the U.S.-Mexico border, the son of Roman Cortez Garza, a rancher, and Rosalia Lira Cortinas. Cortez and his first wife divorced in 1903, and in 1905 he married Estefana Garza<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>. They had no children and later separated.<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>\n\nIn 1887, his family moved to [[Manor, Texas]] near [[Austin]]. Two years later, Cortez joined his older brother, Romaldo Cortez, in finding seasonal employment on the farms and ranches of South Texas. Eventually, Cortez married Leonor D\u00edaz; they had four children. After eleven years as ''vaqueros'', or cowboys, and farmhands, Cortez and his brother settled on a farm in [[Karnes County]], renting land from a local rancher. It is known that he spoke [[English language|English]] and owned horses.<ref name=\"orozco\" />\n\nAt the time that Cortez and his family had immigrated to South Texas, [[Anglo]]s had also begun to penetrate the region in increasing numbers, particularly with the arrival of the railroad. As political and economic power shifted to the newcomers, most Mexican Americans, like Cortez, lived as hired agricultural workers or as tenant farmers. Class and ethnicity relegated them to the bottom of a discriminatory Anglo-dominated Texas society.<ref name= \"jastrzembski\">{{harvnb|Jastrzembski|2000}}</ref>\n\n== Adventure of Cortez ==\n\n=== Incident ===\nThe visit to Cortez followed their interrogation of Villareal in connection with a reported [[horse theft]]. Villareal had already acknowledged his recent trade of a horse for a [[mare]] belonging to Gregorio Cortez. And it was exactly this distinction made in Spanish, between a male horse (''caballo'') and a female horse or mare (''yegua''), that Choate misunderstood when questioning Gregorio. The latter answered negatively when asked on behalf of the Sheriff whether he had recently traded for a horse. For, in truth, he had traded a mare.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nCourt records show that the killings of Romaldo (also known as Rom\u00e1n) Cortez, Gregorio's brother, and [[Sheriff]] W.T. (Brack) Morris were related to the subject of a horse trade.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref> Morris arrived accompanied by one of his [[deputies]], Boone Choate, who could speak Spanish and would thus serve as an interpreter.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref>\n\nInterpreting the response as a lie, the Sheriff made clear his intention to arrest the Cortez brothers. More words were exchanged and a gun battle followed. The sheriff was the first to draw a pistol despite the suspicion on his part that both Cortezes were probably unarmed. Gregorio killed Sheriff Morris in [[self-defense]] after the Sheriff had fired repeatedly on his brother Romaldo who, thinking that Gregorio was unarmed, ran at the Sheriff trying to protect Gregorio.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe Sheriff shot Romaldo and he fell away from the door. And then Gregorio Cortez stood at the door with his pistol in his hand. The Major Sheriff fell dead at the feet of Gregorio Cortez, and it was in this way that Gregorio Cortez killed the first sheriff of many that he was to kill.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 40}}</ref>\nThe killing occurred on June 14, 1901.<ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\n=== Escape to the Robledo ranch ===\n\nAfter the run-in with [[Sheriff]] Morris and [[Sheriffs in the United States|Deputy]] Boone, Cortez wanted to take his injured brother to the closest town, [[Kenedy, Texas]], for medical assistance about 10 miles away. Both on [[horseback]], Cortez and his brother, Romaldo, struggled on their journey as Romaldo was severely hurt and kept falling off his horse. However, Gregorio eventually reached [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy,]] left Romaldo in town to be taken care of, and began his flight from the authorities.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 66}}</ref> \n\nAs officers thought Cortez would be heading south to the border to escape, he decided to head north instead to confuse his pursuers. <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> He traveled 55 miles from [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy]] to [[Belmont, Texas|Belmont]] in hopes of hiding at the house of his friend, Mart\u00edn Robledo. After spending a couple of days at the Robledo ranch, authorities discovered Cortez's whereabouts and thus begun the Battle of Belmont.\n\n=== Battle of Belmont ===\nAfter escaping, Cortez went to the ranch of Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo near [[Belmont, Texas]]. There were seven persons at the Robledo house. Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo, their three sons, Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (a boy living with the Robledos) and a visitor, Mart\u00edn Sandoval. Gonzales County Sheriff Robert M. Glover, a friend of Sheriff Morris, knew where Cortez was hiding, probably from information obtained under duress. This information would have been either provided by Cortez's mother, wife or sister-in-law as they were the only people who knew where Cortez was going.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals report of facts, on June 15, 1904, at the time Sheriff Morris was killed, Sheriff Glover was in [[Cuero]], [[DeWitt County, Texas]]. Glover proceeded with a [[deputy sheriff]] of De Witt County to Kennedy, in [[Karnes County]], and there for the first time learned that Cortez was the man who had killed Sheriff Morris. Glover, knowing the rendezvous of Cortez, boarded a train in about twenty minutes after receiving the information that Cortez had done the killing and proceeded as expeditiously as he could to the town of Ottine, in Gonzales County; there secured horses, and accompanied by two deputy sheriffs of [[Gonzales County]], including Deputy Swift, and other parties, went a few miles in the country to the Schnable ranch; and there learned that Cortez was at the home of Martin Roblero. He and his posse went to Roblero's. The posse divided as they approached the house from the north side; Glover and one or more companions going on the east side of the house around to the south side; and the other parties going on the west side around to the south side of the house. According to the Court, Some of the testimony tends to show that the sheriff's posse shot first; but the preponderance of the evidence shows that Cortez and Bonafacio fired the first shot. Just before the time that the sheriff's posse arrived at the house, Cortez informed Bonafacio that the Sheriff's troop would be on his tail and asked him what he should do, whether to fight or surrender. Bonafacio would have said, \"We will fight\". Immediately upon Glover getting around to a point opposite the gallery on the south side of the house, Cortez and Bonafacio Roblero (the Roblero's eldest son), who were in the gallery, allegedly fired upon Glover and killed him. There was a general fusillade of shots on the part of the posse and Cortez and Bonafacio. On the other hand, in his testimony, Cortez asserts that the officers came up and immediately fired upon him; that he returned this fire. <ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\nThe San-Antonio Express called the Battle of Belmont, as it came to be known, \u201ca tale of bravery unsurpassed on the part of the officers and of desperation on the part of the Mexicans.\u201d. According to this version of the story, Cortez was waiting in ambush, and as Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel approached, he opened fire. Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel were killed <ref>San Antonio Express, June 16, 1901</ref>\n\nThe actual story, according to the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]], was less heroic. Just hours after Cortez arrived at the ranch, Glover and his posse had surrounded the house and began to attack. Cortez fired at Glover who fell dead before running into the brush behind the house to hide. Robledo, his eldest son, and Sandoval were involved in the shooting, while Robledo's wife, his two younger sons and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez stayed unarmed inside the house. Shots were exchanged and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez was wounded, as well as Robledo\u2019s wife. Another member of the posse shot and killed accidentally his companion, Henry Schnabel. In the end, the posse captured five of the Mexicans, including the two wounded. Cortez, however, escaped.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\n=== Flight ===\n\nAfter narrowly escaping the [[Mexican standoff|standoff]] on the Robledo [[ranch]], Cortez \"walked directly south to the [[Bank (geography)|banks]] of the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]] [...] to another friend, Ceferino Flores.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 72}}</ref> Flores gave Cortez a horse and saddle to continue his journey. Cortez would frequently ride in circles and create paths in different directions to throw off the authorities. After days of travel, the [[mare]] grew weary and dropped dead. Soon saddling another small horse, Cortez continued south, just outside of [[Floresville, Texas|Floresville,]] close to [[Cotulla]]. Though Cortez succeeded in creating disorientating routes for officers to follow, he traveled close to the Corpus Christi-to-Laredo [[railroad]] and made it evident that he was moving toward [[Laredo\u2013Nuevo Laredo|Laredo]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> As the law was close behind him, Cortez took risks; having his newfound horse jump over sharp wire fences or pretending he was a [[cattle]] [[herder]]. But on June 20, as the mare could not continue, Cortez left the horse and snuck into [[Cotulla]] and received food and new clothes from locals. Cortez did not have a horse and was essentially surrounded by authorities. However, he went unnoticed, authorities believed he had acquired yet another horse, and that their only chance of catching Cortez would be by accident. Over his 10 day journey, Cortez had ridden three horses, traveled over 500 hundred miles, and had seemingly blended in with the townspeople of [[Cotulla]] <ref name= SanAntonio2016> [https://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/commentary/article/Gregorio-Cortez-the-myth-and-the-man-7420445.php L\u00f3pez, Jos\u00e9 A. \"Gregorio Cortez, the myth and the man.\" ''San Antonio Express-News,'' 7 May 2016.] </ref>.\n\nDuring those 10 days, Cortez was pursued by a posse that at times included up to 300 men. He traveled nearly 400 miles on horseback and more than 100 miles on foot. His story was symbolic of the struggles between the [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican Americans]] in [[South Texas]].<ref>Afterword by Bill Crider. Elmer Kelton. ''Manhunters''. Texas Christian University Press, 1994</ref>\n\n=== Capture ===\n\nGregorio managed to elude hundreds of men in parties of up to three hundred by riding four hundred miles on mares and walking at least 120 miles along the [[Mexico-Texas border]] before ultimately being captured on June 22.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nSuspecting Gregorio\u2019s presence nearby, Glover and eight other Rangers approached the Martin Robledo home at dawn after drinking a bottle of whiskey together. He divided his posse to the east and west sides to surround the house. With the confusion from the alcohol and darkness of night, the shooting began as Glover reached the southeast corner of the home. Glover and Gregorio fired at each other until Glover fell dead from his horse. With two lawmen dead, an extensive manhunt began for Gregorio. The [[Texas Ranger Division]] became involved when the sheriff of [[Atascosa County]] and Ranger Robert M. Glover were shot on the Thulemeyer ranch. \n\nFrom June 15 to June 25, 1901, the story was front-page news of the [[Daily Express]]. Through the newspaper, Cortez, a lone Mexican vaquero, was transformed into a dynamic leader of well-organized thieves. While the [[Euro-American]] public viewed Cortez as a guilty Mexican, Mexican-Americans transformed Cortez into a heroic figure that could outrun the renowned Texas Rangers, and stand up to his oppressors.<ref>Alvear, 28</ref>\n\n== Trials ==\n=== Court proceedings ===\n\n==== Supporters ====\n\nAfter the capture of Cortez, before court proceedings would begin, [[Mexican-Americans]] across the country started a defense fund for Cortez, saying that without the support it would be impossible for him to get a fair trial <ref name= GarberCourts />. The amount of money raised is unknown, however, the fund was largely advertised by a newspaper publisher, Pablo Cruz, and the Sociedad Trabajador Miguel Hidalgo in [[San Antonio]] and saw donations flood in from rich landowners and even local \"rancheros\".<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though Cortez's support was mainly from those of Mexican descent, some [[Anglo-Americans]] admired his \"intellect, wisdom and ingenuity <ref name= SanAntonio2016 />. Some prominent Anglo-Texans aiding Cortez were then [[Texas Secretary of State]], F.C. Weinert, and [[defense lawyer]], R.B Abernathy, who Cortez remembered as one of his most vital attorneys, defending him for over four years <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />.\n\n==== Gonzales trial ====\nThe first of Cortez's trials began on July 24, 1901, in [[Gonzales, Texas]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though many [[Mexicans]] were vocal about and attended the [[trial]] in Gonzales, the [[jury]] consisted of eleven [[Anglo-Americans]] and one [[African-American]]. At Gonzales, \"a gallery full of lawmen filled the courtroom\" <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> and wanted to see Cortez sentenced. The [[prosecution]] tried Cortez for the murder of [[Constable]] Schnabel, one of the men killed at the Battle of Belmont (see above) <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. The prosecution had originally claimed the murder to have been done by Mrs. Robledo during the fight, but they shifted the blame to Cortez and told Robledo to testify that she had seen Cortez shoot and kill both Schnabel and Glover<ref name= Algren1997>Algren, Nelson.

Another [[witness]], Manuel Tom, strengthened the claim, saying that Cortez had confessed to him about killing the two men near a [[barn]] where Robledo described.

The trial swayed all jurors, besides an A.L Sanders who believed Cortez to be innocent. However, as a family member of Sanders's soon developed a serious illness and the juror needed to return home. Sanders succumbed to the jury's pressure and agreed with the others that Cortez was guilty; ultimately sentencing Cortez to 50 years in prison for [[second-degree murder]] <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though Sanders later told the defense he voted \"guilty\" to be there for his sick family member and the attorneys motioned for a new trial, however, their plea was struck down and Sanders was fined $100 for [[contempt of court]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 91}}</ref>\n\nMany local officers were enraged about the [[verdict]] as they wanted to see Cortez face the [[death penalty]]. A few months later, as Cortez was in a Gonzales jail, over 300 men arranged a [[lynching]] of the recently sentenced prisoner <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2)> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2733/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Convictions Upheld In Glover Shooting] </ref>. The hate-filled attempts were unsuccessful, but tensions grew further as soon thereafter, on January 15, 1902, the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed Cortez's sentence <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. The appeal was upheld as the court doubted that Cortez could have murdered both officers within quick succession, as he would have been in two places at the same time, and denied Manuel Tom's crude translation of the word ''barn'' <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. The Gonzales Trial was ultimately a win for Cortez and his defense team, as he would not be tried for the murder of Schnabel again. However, the prosecution backed by the rage of local police forces continued working to see Cortez serve life behind bars or be sentenced to death.\n\n==== Further legal battles ====\nThough Cortez's sentence for the killing of Schnabel was reversed in early 1902 <ref name=GarberCourts> Garber, Margorie B.; Matlock, Jann; Walkowitz, Rebecca (1993). Media Spectacles.

At this trial, \"the families of both Morris and Glover were sat in the front row, where the prosecution could point them out to the jury.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 92}}</ref> However, eight months after the Karnes verdict, the [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed the sentence on the grounds of [[prejudice]] <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. Legal proceedings transferred to [[Pleasanton, Texas]] where a ruling emprisoned Cortez for two years for [[horse theft]]. The court ruling was soon reversed.<ref>Brown 146</ref>\n\nCortez's hearings continued to [[Goliad, Texas]] where the jury could not agree on a sentence for Cortez with \"seven for first-degree murder, four for second-degree murder, and one for acquittal.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 93}}</ref> The trials soon went to [[Wharton County]], where it was dismissed almost immediately, and then to Corpus Christi where Cortez was tried April 25-30, 1904. The jury, consisting of twelve white farmers, found Cortez not guilty for the killing of Morris; saying he acted in [[self-defense]].<ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />\n\nHowever, there was no celebration of the [[acquittal]], as soon thereafter, a court in [[Columbus, Texas]] found Cortez guilty for the murder of Sheriff Glover and sentenced him to life in prison <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though the defense was optimistic about their [[appeal]] being upheld, Cortez's lawyers had built a case saying that Cortez had not fired shots anywhere near Glover in the Battle of Belmont which many witnesses denied.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 94}}</ref>.

In [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]]'s book, ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', he recites eleven versions of ''El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez'' each sung by numerous ''guitarreros'' (guitarists) near the [[Mexican-American border]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 175}}</ref> Though each [[corrido]] had their own style, flair, or message wanting to be relayed, they all exaggerated the life of Cortez to transform him into a Mexican [[folk hero]].\n\n=== With His Pistol in His Hand ===\n\nThe life and legend of Gregorio Cortez were studied by the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in a doctoral thesis on corridos that was later published in a revised version by the University of Texas Press in 1958 under the title ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016}}</ref> Paredes's work is about the life of Cortez, his legend, the formal aspects and variants of the corrido, and the cultural significance reflected in these products. \n\nThe book is one of the most influential books in  [[Chicano]] cultural studies and has received wide recognition and outstanding success in the academic world.<ref>Lopez Mor\u00edn, Jos\u00e9 R., and Project Muse University Press Archival eBooks.

It was directed by [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], and based on Paredes's  ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p 64</ref>. The film deals with the creation of the myth as well as the reconstruction of the historical reality of the life and adventure of Gregorio Cortez.<ref>{{harvnb|Elitzik|1984|page= 38}}</ref>\n\nThe film is classified as a Western, but it is different from other films of the genre due to its historical realism. While classic elements of a western are present in the film such as horse racing, a lynch mob, a heroic sheriff and the vast desert space of Texas, the film's authenticity is a profound departure from this genre <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.P64</ref> <ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> The magazine ''Cin\u00e9aste'' described the film as \"the true history of the West\".<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> and the movie has been considered the most authentic Westerns in the history of American cinema by the United States Historical Society <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p64</ref>. This sense of authenticity is due in part to the documentary-style used by the director to tell the life of Gregorio Cortez, but also to the choice made by Villasenor to develop the point of view of the people involved in the story, regardless of their ethnicity, thus presenting real historical characters and not the stereotypes of a myth. This process makes it possible to represent the hostility between communities in South Texas and the violation of the land rights of Mexican Americans by Texas Rangers or lynch mobs <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018. p65</ref>. On the other hand, through this process, the scriptwriters were able to highlight the origins of the myth as well as the stages of its construction. The myth is presented as an episode in the history of the conflict between the Anglo-Americans and The Mexican-Americans.<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref>\n\nIn an interview, the film's director, [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], suggested that he wanted to represent the different interpretations surrounding life and legend. He declared \"I thought the important thing was, first, to tell a story that wasn't linear- I don't believe in those kinds of stories, things are always more complicated - and then to deal with the differing interpretations.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref> Young wanted to represent the fantasies created by the two ethnic groups, namely the exaggeration of Cortez's exploits for the Mexicans and the belief that Cortez was at the head of an entire gang for the Anglos. He declared to the Cin\u00e9aste that he \" tried to take the audience into the story so they would make the same mistakes as the Anglos and, later, when they find out what happened, they wouldn't feel superior to the Anglo characters but realize that they'd made the same error\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>.\n\nIf racism is portrayed throughout the film, the director downplays it. It was a deliberate choice to keep the humanity of the characters and to denounce it more vigorously. According to Young, \"The people who perpetuate the racism are people, too, they're human. If you go too heavy on the racism, it makes it difficult to see them as people.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Juan Cortina]]\n* [[Joaquin Murietta]]\n* [[Tiburcio Vasquez]]\n* [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]]\n* [[Manifest Destiny]]\n* [[Texas Ranger Division]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}} \n\n== Sources ==\n* {{citation|last= Alonzo |first= A.

{"title_page": "Referendum", "text_new": "{{Elections}}\nA '''referendum''' (plural: '''referendums''' or less commonly '''referenda''') is a [[Direct democracy|direct]] and [[Universal suffrage|universal]] [[vote]] in which an entire [[Constituency|electorate]] is invited to vote on a particular proposal and can have nationwide or [[Electoral district|local]] forms. This may result in the adoption of a new [[policy]] or specific [[law]].

As a gerundive is an [[adjective]],<ref>A gerundive is a verbal adjective (Kennedy's Shorter Latin Primer, 1962 edition, p. 91.)</ref> not a [[noun]],<ref>A [[gerund]]  is a verbal noun (Kennedy's Shorter Latin Primer, 1962 edition, p. 91.) but has no nominative case, for which an infinitive (''referre'') serves the purpose</ref> it cannot be used alone in Latin, and must be contained within a  context attached to a noun such as ''Propositum quod referendum est populo'', \"A proposal which must be carried back to the people\". The addition of the verb ''sum'' (3rd person singular, ''est'') to a gerundive, denotes the idea of necessity or compulsion, that which \"must\" be done, rather than that which is \"fit for\" doing. Its use as a noun in English is not considered a strictly grammatical usage of a foreign word, but is rather a freshly coined English noun, which follows English grammatical usage, not Latin grammatical usage. This determines the form of the plural in English, which according to English grammar should be \"referendums\". The use of \"referenda\" as a plural form in English (treating it as a Latin word and attempting to apply to it the rules of Latin grammar) is unsupportable according to the rules of both Latin and English grammar. The use of \"referenda\" as a plural form is  posited hypothetically as either a gerund or a gerundive by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', which rules out such usage in both cases as follows:<ref>Oxford English Dictionary Referendum</ref>\n\n<blockquote>''Referendums'' is logically preferable as a plural form meaning 'ballots on one issue' (as a Latin gerund,<ref>a [[gerund]] is a verbal noun (Kennedy's Shorter Latin Primer, 1962 edition, p. 91.) but has no nominative case, for which an infinitive (''referre'') serves the purpose. It has only accusative, genitive, dative and ablative cases (Kennedy's Shorter Latin Primer, 1962 edition, pp. 91-2.)</ref> referendum has no plural). The Latin plural gerundive 'referenda', meaning 'things to be referred', necessarily connotes a plurality of issues.<ref>i.e. ''Proposita quae referenda sunt popolo'', \"Proposals which must be carried back to the people\"</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt is closely related to [[political agenda|agenda]], \"those matters which must be driven forward\", from ''ago'', to drive (cattle); and [[memorandum]], \"that matter which must be remembered\", from ''memoro'', to call to mind, [[corrigenda]], from ''rego'', to rule, make straight, those things which must be made straight (corrected), etc.\n\n==Earliest use ==\nThe name and use of the 'referendum' is thought to have originated in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] canton of [[Graub\u00fcnden]] as early as the 16th century.<ref>Barber, Benjamin R.. ''The Death of Communal Liberty: A History of Freedom in a Swiss Mountain Canton''. Princeton University Press, 1974, p. 179.</ref><ref>Vincent, J.M.. ''State and Federal Government in Switzerland'', Johns Hopkins University Press, 2009, p.&nbsp;122</ref>\n\nThe term 'plebiscite' has a generally similar meaning in modern usage, and comes from the Latin ''plebiscita'', which originally meant a decree of the ''[[Plebeian Council|Concilium Plebis]]'' (Plebeian Council), the popular assembly of the [[Roman Republic]]. Today, a referendum can also often be referred to as a plebiscite, but in some countries the two terms are used differently to refer to votes with differing types of legal consequences. For example,  Australia defines 'referendum' as a vote to change the constitution, and 'plebiscite' as a vote that does not affect the constitution.<ref name=Green/> In contrast, Ireland has only ever held one plebiscite, which was the vote to adopt its constitution, and every other vote has been called a referendum. Plebiscite has also been used to denote a non-binding vote count such as the one held by Nazi Germany to 'approve' in retrospect the so-called Anschluss with Austria, the question being not 'Do you permit?' but rather 'Do you approve?' of that which has most definitely already occurred.\n\n==Typology==\nThe term referendum covers a variety of different meanings. A referendum can be binding or advisory.<ref>{{cite book |pages=2\u20133 |title=The Dynamics of Referendum Campaigns: An International Perspective|chapter=Context, Elites, Media and Public Opinion in Reerendums: When Campaigns Really Matter|last= de Vreese |first=Claes H. |isbn=9780230591189 |chapter-url=https://books.google.de/books?id=wHuGDAAAQBAJ |date= 2007 |publisher= Palgrave Macmillan}}\n</ref> In some countries, different names are used for these two types of referendum.\n\nReferendums can be further classified by who initiates them: mandatory referendums prescribed by law, voluntary referendums initiated by the legislature or government, and referendums initiated by citizens.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Serd\u00fclt|first1=Uwe|last2=Welp|first2=Yanina|title=Direct Democracy Upside Down|journal=Taiwan Journal of Democracy| date=2012 |volume=8 |issue=1 |url=http://www.tfd.org.tw/export/sites/tfd/files/publication/journal/dj0801/004.pdf|doi=10.5167/uzh-98412|pages=69\u201392}}</ref>\n\nA [[deliberative referendum]] is a referendum specifically designed to improve the deliberative qualities of the campaign preceding the referendum vote, and/or of the act of voting itself.\n\n==Rationale==\nFrom a political-philosophical perspective, referendums are an expression of [[direct democracy]], but today, most referendums need to be understood within the context of representative democracy.

Some referendums give voters the choice among multiple choices and some use transferable voting.\n\nIn [[Switzerland]], for example, multiple choice referendums are common. Two multiple choice referendums were held in [[Sweden]], in 1957 and in 1980, in which voters were offered three options. In 1977, a referendum held in [[Australia]] to determine a new [[Advance Australia Fair|national anthem]] was held in which voters had four choices. In 1992, New Zealand held a five-option referendum on their electoral system. In 1982, Guam had referendum that used six options, with an additional blank option for those wishing to (campaign and) vote for their own seventh option.\n\nA multiple choice referendum poses the question of how the result is to be determined. They may be set up so that if no single option receives the support of an absolute [[majority]] (more than half) of the votes, resort can be made to the two-round system or [[instant-runoff voting]], which is also called IRV and PV.\n\nIn 2018 the Irish [[Citizens' Assembly (Ireland)|Citizens' Assembly]] considered the conduct of future [[referendums in Ireland]], with 76 of the members in favour of allowing more than two options, and 52% favouring preferential voting in such cases.<ref name=\"citizensassembly_referenda\">{{cite web|url=https://www.citizensassembly.ie/en/Manner-in-which-referenda-are-held/Manner-in-which-referenda-are-held.html|title=Manner in which referenda are held|publisher=Citizens' Assembly|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref> Other people regard a non-majoritarian methodology like the [[Modified Borda Count]] (MBC) as more inclusive and more accurate.\n\nSwiss referendums offer a separate vote on each of the multiple options as well as an additional decision about which of the multiple options should be preferred. In the Swedish case, in both referendums the 'winning' option was chosen by the [[First Past the Post electoral system|Single Member Plurality]] (\"first past the post\") system. In other words, the winning option was deemed to be that supported by a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]], rather than an absolute majority, of voters.

Polls in Newfoundland (1949) and Guam (1982), for example, were counted under a form of the [[two-round system]], and an unusual form of TRS was used in the 1992 New Zealand poll.\n\nAlthough [[California]] has not held multiple-choice referendums in the Swiss or Swedish sense (in which only one of several counter-propositions can be victorious, and the losing proposals are wholly null and void), it does have so many yes-or-no referendums at each Election Day that conflicts arise. The State's Constitution provides a method for resolving conflicts when two or more inconsistent propositions are passed on the same day. This is a de facto form of [[approval voting]]\u2014i.e. the proposition with the most \"yes\" votes prevails over the others to the extent of any conflict.\n\nAnother voting system that could be used in multiple-choice referendum is the [[Condorcet method|Condorcet rule]].\n\n==Criticisms==\n\n===Criticism of populist aspect===\n[[File:Odessa Russian Sring 20140330 07.JPG|thumb|Pro-Russian protesters in [[Odessa]], [[Ukraine]], demanding a referendum, March 30, 2014]]\n[[File:20150703 Greek Referendum Demonstration for NO syntagma square Athens Greece.jpg|thumb| [[2015 Greek bailout referendum]] Demonstration for \"NO\" vote [[Syntagma square]] [[Athens]], [[Greece]] ]]\n\nCritics{{who|date=February 2016}} of the referendum argue that voters in a referendum are more likely to be driven by transient whims than by careful deliberation, or that they are not sufficiently informed to make decisions on complicated or technical issues.

As a gerundive is an [[adjective]],<ref>A gerundive is a verbal adjective (Kennedy's Shorter Latin Primer, 1962 edition, p. 91.)</ref> not a [[noun]],<ref>A [[gerund]]  is a verbal noun (Kennedy's Shorter Latin Primer, 1962 edition, p. 91.) but has no nominative case, for which an infinitive (''referre'') serves the purpose</ref> it cannot be used alone in Latin, and must be contained within a  context attached to a noun such as ''Propositum quod referendum est populo'', \"A proposal which must be carried back to the people\". The addition of the verb ''sum'' (3rd person singular, ''est'') to a gerundive, denotes the idea of necessity or compulsion, that which \"must\" be done, rather than that which is \"fit for\" doing. Its use as a noun in English is not considered a strictly grammatical usage of a foreign word, but is rather a freshly coined English noun, which follows English grammatical usage, not Latin grammatical usage. This determines the form of the plural in English, which according to English grammar should be \"referendums\". The use of \"referenda\" as a plural form in English (treating it as a Latin word and attempting to apply to it the rules of Latin grammar) is unsupportable according to the rules of both Latin and English grammar. The use of \"referenda\" as a plural form is  posited hypothetically as either a gerund or a gerundive by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', which rules out such usage in both cases as follows:<ref>Oxford English Dictionary Referendum</ref>\n\n<blockquote>''Referendums'' is logically preferable as a plural form meaning 'ballots on one issue' (as a Latin gerund,<ref>a [[gerund]] is a verbal noun (Kennedy's Shorter Latin Primer, 1962 edition, p. 91.) but has no nominative case, for which an infinitive (''referre'') serves the purpose. It has only accusative, genitive, dative and ablative cases (Kennedy's Shorter Latin Primer, 1962 edition, pp. 91-2.)</ref> referendum has no plural). The Latin plural gerundive 'referenda', meaning 'things to be referred', necessarily connotes a plurality of issues.<ref>i.e. ''Proposita quae referenda sunt popolo'', \"Proposals which must be carried back to the people\"</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt is closely related to [[political agenda|agenda]], \"those matters which must be driven forward\", from ''ago'', to drive (cattle); and [[memorandum]], \"that matter which must be remembered\", from ''memoro'', to call to mind, [[corrigenda]], from ''rego'', to rule, make straight, those things which must be made straight (corrected), etc.\n\n==Earliest use ==\nThe name and use of the 'referendum' is thought to have originated in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] canton of [[Graub\u00fcnden]] as early as the 16th century.<ref>Barber, Benjamin R.. ''The Death of Communal Liberty: A History of Freedom in a Swiss Mountain Canton''. Princeton University Press, 1974, p. 179.</ref><ref>Vincent, J.M.. ''State and Federal Government in Switzerland'', Johns Hopkins University Press, 2009, p.&nbsp;122</ref>\n\nThe term 'plebiscite' has a generally similar meaning in modern usage, and comes from the Latin ''plebiscita'', which originally meant a decree of the ''[[Plebeian Council|Concilium Plebis]]'' (Plebeian Council), the popular assembly of the [[Roman Republic]]. Today, a referendum can also often be referred to as a plebiscite, but in some countries the two terms are used differently to refer to votes with differing types of legal consequences. For example,  Australia defines 'referendum' as a vote to change the constitution, and 'plebiscite' as a vote that does not affect the constitution.<ref name=Green/> In contrast, Ireland has only ever held one plebiscite, which was the vote to adopt its constitution, and every other vote has been called a referendum. Plebiscite has also been used to denote a non-binding vote count such as the one held by Nazi Germany to 'approve' in retrospect the so-called Anschluss with Austria, the question being not 'Do you permit?' but rather 'Do you approve?' of that which has most definitely already occurred.\n\n==Typology==\nThe term referendum covers a variety of different meanings.

A 2009 article in ''[[The Economist]]'' argued that this had restricted the ability of the [[California]] state government to tax the people and pass the budget, and called for an entirely new Californian constitution.<ref>{{Cite news\n | title=California: The ungovernable state\n | magazine=[[The Economist]]\n | location=[[London]]\n | date=16\u201322 May 2009\n | pages=33\u201336\n | url=http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displayStory.cfm?STORY_ID=13649050\n }}</ref>\n\nA similar problem also arises when elected governments accumulate excessive debts. That can severely reduce the effective margin for later governments.\n\nBoth these problems can be moderated by a combination of other measures as \n* strict rules for correct accounting on budget plans and effective public expenditure;\n* mandatory assessment by an independent public institution of all budgetary implications of all legislative proposals, before they can be approved;\n* mandatory prior assessment of the constitutional coherence of any proposal;\n* interdiction of extra-budget expenditure (tax payers anyway have to fund them, sooner or later).\n\n==Sources==\n* The Federal Authorities of the Swiss Confederation, statistics (German). https://web.archive.org/web/20081210071708/http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/17/03/blank/key/stimmbeteiligung.html\n* {{cite journal|last1=Turcoane|first1= Ovidiu|title=A proposed contextual evaluation of referendum quorum using fuzzy logics|journal= Journal of Applied Quantitative Methods |volume=10|issue= 2|date=2015|pages= 83\u201393|url=http://www.jaqm.ro/issues/volume-10,issue-2/pdfs/8_OV_.pdf}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Referendums by country]]\n* [[Popular referendum]]\n* [[Initiative]]\n* [[Direct democracy]]\n* [[Mandatory referendum]]\n* [[Optional referendum]]\n* [[Right to petition]]\n* [[Independence referendum]]\n* [[War referendum]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category|Referendums}}\n* Morel, L.

Association members have access to the Lake through the guard gates at both North and East beach.  Other portions of the shoreline have been developed as private residential projects and commercial village (Market on the Lake).  Smaller private beach facilities around the Lake are for the exclusive use of waterfront homeowners.  Costs and operations of any private facilities for lakefront developments will be paid for and are the responsibility of that lakefront owner.\nOther amenities include, Fishing, recreation (boating and swimming) as well as Concerts, Movie Nights and Summer Camps during the summer months.  Lake Mission Viejo is a private recreational facility/ HOA that is for the use and enjoyment of members that  own or live in Lake Member Properties within the city of Mission Viejo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lakemissionviejo.org/|title=Lake Mission Viejo Association|website=lakemissionviejo.org|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>\n\nAbout {{convert|5|mi|km}} south of [[Santiago Peak]], a peak in the [[Santa Ana Mountains]], the lake is surrounded by private residential (single-family and condominium) communities, and is a private membership for Mission Viejo residents. The primary [[marina]] is located in the northwestern arm of the lake. Upstream of Lake Mission Viejo is Upper Oso Reservoir,<ref>{{gnis|1765707|Upper Oso Reservoir}}</ref> which spills downstream and into Mission Viejo in wet years.\n\n==Beaches==\nThere are two main beaches, Playa del Norte and Playa del Este, with a few smaller, private beaches. The larger beaches are both protected by the Lake Mission Viejo Lifeguards. Both beaches contain playgrounds, [[barbecue]]s and picnic areas, snack bar (North Beach Only) and [[fishing]] areas.\n\n===Playa del Norte (or North Beach)===\nMore commonly referred to as North Beach, is the largest beach at Lake Mission Viejo. It contains the largest sandy beach area, [[volleyball]] courts, a full [[basketball]] court (in the winter months), and a clubhouse available to rent. All of the administration buildings are located at the North Beach. All boat rentals and boat launching is located at the North Beach. North Beach is open all year round. Snack Bar services are provided by Tony's at Lake Mission Viejo  during the summer season as well as special menu for concert days and the Annual Jazz Fest/Taste of the Lake.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lakemissionviejo.org/|title=Lake Mission Viejo Association|website=lakemissionviejo.org|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>\n\n===Playa del Este (or East Beach)===\nMore commonly referred to as East Beach, Playa del Este is the second largest beach at Lake Mission Viejo. East beach also has picnic tables, barbeques, playground area, basketball courts and an upper picnic area overlooking the Lake which may be reserved for larger groups. East Beach is open daily during summer and on weekends from Memorial Day through Labor Day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lakemissionviejo.org/|title=Lake Mission Viejo Association|website=lakemissionviejo.org|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>\n\n==Swimmer's Itch==\nDuring spring and parts of the summer, [[swimmer's itch]], also called cercarial dermatitis can appear. It is a microscopic pest that lives on hosts like birds and snails by biting into their skin.  Once it bites a human, it dies but leaves an irritated area or bump like a mosquito bite. The itching will be gone as well as the bump in a few days. Swimmer's itch can be prevented by showering thoroughly after swimming.  There have been no reports of swimmers itch at the Lake Mission Viejo since 2015.\n\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lakemissionviejo.org/|title=Lake Mission Viejo Association|website=lakemissionviejo.org|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>\n\n== Boating <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lakemissionviejo.org/|title=Lake Mission Viejo Association|website=lakemissionviejo.org|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref> ==\nLake Association members find excellent sailing conditions on Lake Mission Viejo.  There is a rental fleet which includes rowboats, available with electric motors, 14\u2019 Capri Sailboats, pedal boats, kayaks, and party (pontoon) boats.  All rental boats are available to Association members and their guests for a reasonable fee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lakemissionviejo.org/|title=Lake Mission Viejo Association|website=lakemissionviejo.org|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>\n\n==Fishing==\nThe Lake is stocked with different kinds of fish including trout, catfish, tilapia, bass and sunfish.  Specially designed fish habitats have been built on the bottom of the lake to promote good fishing and spawning. In November of 2014 an outbreak of Golden Algae decimated the LMVA fish populations, resulting in an unprecedented loss in fish stocks. Lake biologists were seen applying a chemical algae killer directly to the water in an effort to eradicate the Golden Algae, which seemed to not be effective. Since the die-off, unpopular tilapia were introduced and as of 2019, the Golden Algae issue hasn't been resolved. Subsequent stockings of trout have seen large volume die-offs over the years and no solution has been found. Lake Association members may fish at the designated shoreline area adjacent to the marina, or from a boat out on the lake.  Association members receive identification badges for eligible family members.  These badges entitle the member to free fishing privileges (guests must pay a fishing fee).  \nIn order to protect the natural ecological balance of the Lake, only specified types of baits are permitted. Bait and other fishing equipment may be purchased at the Boat Rental Office.  Fishing club information is also available at the Boat Rental office.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lakemissionviejo.org/|title=Lake Mission Viejo Association|website=lakemissionviejo.org|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>\n\n===Records===\n\nOn April 1, 2006 George Coniglio caught a 19&nbsp;lbs 12 oz [[largemouth bass]].

The reservoir is formed by an earthfill dam across the canyon of [[Oso Creek]],<ref>{{gnis| 246995|Oso Creek}}</ref> which is part of the [[Trabuco Creek]] and [[San Juan Creek]] drainage basin.<ref>{{gnis|1765671}}</ref> The lake is not fed by urban runoff; it is maintained so as to be safe for contact.<ref>Stevens, Matt (October 30, 2014) [http://www.latimes.com/local/orangecounty/la-me-lake-mission-viejo-20141030-story.html \"Lake Mission Viejo isn't feeling California drought \u2014 yet\"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''</ref> The Lake Association owns and operates the Lake facilities which include approximately 124 surface acres of water and 50 acres of land, including Playa del Norte (North Beach) and Marina, Playa del Este (East Beach), parking facilities, Market on the Lake Dock and dam.\nRecreational facilities available for Lake Association members include the Lake, two large beaches and picnic areas, clubhouse rental, boat launching facility and shoreline fishing area.\n\nThe Lake Mission Viejo Association, is a California Non-Profit corporation consisting of those residential property owners within the ultimate boundaries of the Mission Viejo planned community.  Association members have access to the Lake through the guard gates at both North and East beach.  Other portions of the shoreline have been developed as private residential projects and commercial village (Market on the Lake).  Smaller private beach facilities around the Lake are for the exclusive use of waterfront homeowners.  Costs and operations of any private facilities for lakefront developments will be paid for and are the responsibility of that lakefront owner.\nOther amenities include, Fishing, recreation (boating and swimming) as well as Concerts, Movie Nights and Summer Camps during the summer months.  Lake Mission Viejo is a private recreational facility/ HOA that is for the use and enjoyment of members that  own or live in Lake Member Properties within the city of Mission Viejo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lakemissionviejo.org/|title=Lake Mission Viejo Association|website=lakemissionviejo.org|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>\n\nAbout {{convert|5|mi|km}} south of [[Santiago Peak]], a peak in the [[Santa Ana Mountains]], the lake is surrounded by private residential (single-family and condominium) communities, and is a private membership for Mission Viejo residents. The primary [[marina]] is located in the northwestern arm of the lake. Upstream of Lake Mission Viejo is Upper Oso Reservoir,<ref>{{gnis|1765707|Upper Oso Reservoir}}</ref> which spills downstream and into Mission Viejo in wet years.\n\n==Beaches==\nThere are two main beaches, Playa del Norte and Playa del Este, with a few smaller, private beaches. The larger beaches are both protected by the Lake Mission Viejo Lifeguards. Both beaches contain playgrounds, [[barbecue]]s and picnic areas, snack bar (North Beach Only) and [[fishing]] areas.\n\n===Playa del Norte (or North Beach)===\nMore commonly referred to as North Beach, is the largest beach at Lake Mission Viejo. It contains the largest sandy beach area, [[volleyball]] courts, a full [[basketball]] court (in the winter months), and a clubhouse available to rent. All of the administration buildings are located at the North Beach. All boat rentals and boat launching is located at the North Beach. North Beach is open all year round. Snack Bar services are provided by Tony's at Lake Mission Viejo  during the summer season as well as special menu for concert days and the Annual Jazz Fest/Taste of the Lake.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lakemissionviejo.org/|title=Lake Mission Viejo Association|website=lakemissionviejo.org|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>\n\n===Playa del Este (or East Beach)===\nMore commonly referred to as East Beach, Playa del Este is the second largest beach at Lake Mission Viejo. East beach also has picnic tables, barbeques, playground area, basketball courts and an upper picnic area overlooking the Lake which may be reserved for larger groups. East Beach is open daily during summer and on weekends from Memorial Day through Labor Day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lakemissionviejo.org/|title=Lake Mission Viejo Association|website=lakemissionviejo.org|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>\n\n==Swimmer's Itch==\nDuring spring and parts of the summer, [[swimmer's itch]], also called cercarial dermatitis can appear. It is a microscopic pest that lives on hosts like birds and snails by biting into their skin.  Once it bites a human, it dies but leaves an irritated area or bump like a mosquito bite. The itching will be gone as well as the bump in a few days. Swimmer's itch can be prevented by showering thoroughly after swimming.  There have been no reports of swimmers itch at the Lake Mission Viejo since 2015.\n\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lakemissionviejo.org/|title=Lake Mission Viejo Association|website=lakemissionviejo.org|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>\n\n== Boating <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lakemissionviejo.org/|title=Lake Mission Viejo Association|website=lakemissionviejo.org|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref> ==\nLake Association members find excellent sailing conditions on Lake Mission Viejo.  There is a rental fleet which includes rowboats, available with electric motors, 14\u2019 Capri Sailboats, pedal boats, kayaks, and party (pontoon) boats.  All rental boats are available to Association members and their guests for a reasonable fee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lakemissionviejo.org/|title=Lake Mission Viejo Association|website=lakemissionviejo.org|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>\n\n==Fishing==\nThe Lake is stocked with different kinds of fish including trout, catfish, tilapia, bass and sunfish.  Specially designed fish habitats have been built on the bottom of the lake to promote good fishing and spawning. In November of 2014 an outbreak of Golden Algae decimated the LMVA fish populations, resulting in an unprecedented loss in fish stocks. Lake biologists were seen applying a chemical algae killer directly to the water in an effort to eradicate the Golden Algae, which seemed to not be effective. Since the die-off, unpopular tilapia were introduced and as of 2019, the Golden Algae issue hasn't been resolved. Subsequent stockings of trout have seen large volume die-offs over the years and no solution has been found. Lake Association members may fish at the designated shoreline area adjacent to the marina, or from a boat out on the lake.  Association members receive identification badges for eligible family members.  These badges entitle the member to free fishing privileges (guests must pay a fishing fee).  \nIn order to protect the natural ecological balance of the Lake, only specified types of baits are permitted. Bait and other fishing equipment may be purchased at the Boat Rental Office.  Fishing club information is also available at the Boat Rental office.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lakemissionviejo.org/|title=Lake Mission Viejo Association|website=lakemissionviejo.org|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref>\n\n===Records===\n\nOn April 1, 2006 George Coniglio caught a 19&nbsp;lbs 12 oz [[largemouth bass]].

The Avatar is first known as the '''''Stranger from another world''''', who defeats Mondain, Minax, and their spawn, Exodus. The Stranger becomes the Avatar once his goal changes to following the path of the Virtues, and retrieving the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom from the Great Stygian Abyss. This is noted as one of the first uses of \"Avatar\" in the virtual context.<ref>My Avatar, My Self: Identity in Video Role-Playing Games By Zach Waggoner, Chapter notes, page 185</ref> In the fifth episode, the Avatar defeats a repressive regime over Britannia, and in the sixth he brings peace between men and gargoyles. In the first part of the seventh episode, the Avatar infiltrates the Fellowship in order to stop the Guardian from entering Britannia; in the second part, the Avatar prevents imbalance from destroying the universe and receives the title of the Hierophant of Balance. In the eighth episode, the Avatar escapes the world of Pagan by defeating the four Titans, becoming the Titan of Ether. In the ninth and final episode, the Avatar defeats the Guardian by destroying both himself and the Guardian with the Armageddon spell. The Avatar is also the main character in both ''[[Ultima Underworld]]'' games.\n\nThe Avatar can be customized as a male or female in many of the games. Later games allow the customization of skin and hair color as well. The default Avatar is depicted as a blond-haired, blue-eyed male. The character is noted as the first to have a selection between genders and races, and the female version is noted to be \"feminine, but not hypersexual.\"<ref>Gender Inclusive Game Design: Expanding the Market, by Sheri Graner Ray, page 27</ref> The Avatar's trademark clothing often includes a suit of [[chain mail]], with a white, red or orange [[tunic]] over it, and a red cape. An [[ankh]] is usually part of the Avatar's clothing. Typically, the character is also shown wielding a sword. In ''[[Ultima VIII: Pagan|Ultima VIII]]'', the Avatar's face is obscured by a large helmet. The Avatar is voiced by J.C. Shakespeare in ''[[Ultima IX: Ascension|Ultima IX]]''.\n\nThe Avatar was initially designed to be a blank slate through which players could reflect their own personality<ref>{{cite web|author= Jesse Schedeen |url=http://uk.stars.ign.com/articles/907/907102p8.html |title=Players Wanted: Ultimate Fighting Game - Stars Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.stars.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref> ''Ultima'' was one of the first computer games to allow players to choose their gender and race.<ref>Gender Inclusive Game Design: Expanding the Market , by Sheri Graner Ray, page 27</ref> However, the Avatar eventually evolved to take on a more specific appearance and character.<ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/features/tenspot_heroes/hero2.html Ten Best Heroes in Gaming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710004638/http://www.gamespot.com/features/tenspot_heroes/hero2.html |date=2007-07-10 }}</ref>\n\n===The Eight Companions {{anchor|The Companions of the Avatar}}===\nThe Eight Companions are the ones who join the Stranger in his quest to attain the Avatarhood in ''[[Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar|Ultima IV]]'' (in fact, only seven of them join the Stranger in the game; the one who has the same profession as the Stranger will not join the party, as that profession's role is fulfilled by the Stranger). They are special in the way that each of them originally practices a particular profession which connects with one of the eight virtues and the town of that virtue. They are the Avatar's first ever followers, and many of them join the Avatar again in subsequent adventures. Starting from ''Ultima IV'', the Eight Companions appear in all the primary games of the series that are set in Britannia, i.e., ''Ultima IV'', ''V'', ''VI'', ''VII (Part I)'' and ''IX'', and many of them can be asked to join the Avatar's party in these games. Some of them take up other professions in later games.\n* '''Iolo''' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|j|o\u028a|l|o\u028a}} is one of the most famed [[bard]]s in Britannia, and a [[bowyer]] famous for his [[crossbow]]s. He lives in Britain in ''Ultima IV''. While he and Gwenno have always been in the game series and seen together since ''Ultima II'', they are finally revealed to be husband and wife in the manual of ''Ultima V'' where his full name is revealed to be '''Iolo FitzOwen'''. He is the creator of the music for the famous song, \"Stones\", for which Gwenno wrote the lyrics. He owns the talking horse, Smith, who constantly makes sarcastic comments about the Avatar. By ''Ultima VII'' he has owned two bow shops. He is based on the real life bowyer and composer [[David R. Watson]].\n* '''Shamino Sall\u00e9 Dacil''' is a ranger living in Skara Brae. Originally, he was a ruler of one of the eight kingdoms of ancient Sosaria. He and the King of the White Dragon shared the rulership of the Lands of Danger and Despair. Some time after meeting the Stranger and assisting him in his quest in ''Ultima I'', he set out to meet his old friend, Lord British. He got trapped in Britannia when Mondain's defeat led to the separation of the four Sosarian continents, leaving his lover, Beatrix, behind. He has become a ranger by ''Ultima IV''. Shamino accompanies the Avatar to the Serpent Isle in ''Ultima VII Part II'', which turns out to be the old Lands of Danger and Despair. Beatrix's ghost appears to him, initially hostile, but eventually forgives him for leaving, and departs to the afterlife after giving him a book of love sonnets. He later is trapped by the Guardian in the void, but is freed by the Avatar at the end. Shamino is based on Richard Garriott, as it is his persona name in the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]]. He took the name from his bicycle, a [[Shimano]]. A sequence in ''[[Ultima VI: The False Prophet|Ultima VI]]'' has a conversation between the NPC Finn who also looks like Garriot that references that both he, Shamino and Lord British are the same person.\n* '''Dupre''' is a [[paladin]] and the mayor of the town of Trinsic. He joins the Stranger on his quest to become the Avatar. He becomes a regular companion for the following games. He is knighted sometime between ''Ultima VI'' and ''Ultima VII''. In ''Ultima V'', he is found hiding on the island of Bordermarch. Being quite fond of wine and women, he often stays in taverns while not traveling, and he even does a study for a series of travel guides. In ''Ultima VII'', he runs up a substantial bar tab, and the Avatar has the option of paying it off. He eventually sacrifices himself to save Serpent Isle, and he is later resurrected to help fight the Guardian in ''Ultima IX''. He is based on Richard Garriott's real-life friend Greg Dykes.\n* '''Jaana''' is a [[druid]] and a friend of Lord British. Once Blackthorn takes over, she is declared as an outlaw, and actively works with the resistance against him. She later moves to Cove and becomes the local healer, and later helps fight against the Guardian. Richard Garriott named her after a friend of his from [[Finland]] with the same name.\n* '''Julia''' is a [[tinker]] with a [[Scottish English|Scottish accent]] first found in Minoc. In ''Ultima VII'', she helps uncover the flaws in Owen's shipbuilding. In ''Ultima IX'', the one game in the ''Ultima'' series in which the Avatar cannot be female, she confesses she was in love with him. She is based on someone Garriott once dated.\n* '''Katrina''' is a [[shepherd]], and the only survivor of the [[Demon|daemon]] attack that destroyed the island port city of Magincia. She still lives in the ruins of the destroyed city. Later, Magincia is resettled as New Magincia, a simple agricultural community that, unlike its predecessor, embraces the virtue of Humility. Katrina becomes one of its first citizens. She later ends up as the only citizen after it is abandoned, and the Avatar helps restore Humility to the area. She is based on a friend of Richard Garriott's that goes by the nickname Trina.\n* '''Geoffrey''' is a [[warrior|fighter]] first met in Jhelom. He becomes captain of the guard, and helps defend against gargoyles. He eventually retires to Lord British's castle. Geoffrey is based on Jeff Hillhouse, Origin's first and last employee.\n* '''Mariah''' is a [[Magician (fantasy)|mage]] and a resident of Moonglow. She seeks adventure, and after being attacked by Shadowlords, she hides in Lycaeum and meets the Avatar. In ''Ultima VI'', she can translate the two pieces of the Gargoyles' tablet. After insanity affects many of the mages in the area, she is very depressed, though the Avatar manages to fix the problems. Mariah is based on Richard Garriott's real-life personal assistant, Michelle Caddel.\n\n===Other companions===\nApart from the Eight Companions, the Avatar may ask other characters to join his party starting from ''Ultima V''. Some of these characters may have been appearing in the game series a number of times already, and some may join the Avatar in multiple games, while others may appear only once in the series. In some cases, minor NPCs join the party only for a very short period of time. Yet some of them may play a major role and be part of the party throughout the entire game.\n* '''Gwenno'''{{efn|name=\"gwenno\"}} is an entertainer, scholar and an explorer, who appears frequently with her husband Iolo in the series. She joins the Avatar's party to accompany her husband from time to time. In the ''Ultima V'' game manual, she is listed as having written the lyrics to the song \"''Stones''\",<ref>Dungeons and desktops: the history of computer role-playing games, by Matt Barton, page 117</ref> and her full name is '''Gwenllian Gwalch'gaeaf'''. She was based on Kathleen Jones, the real-life wife of David R. Watson (Iolo).\n* '''Sentri''' is a fighter and occasional companion of the Avatar. He first appears as Sentri the Swashbuckler in the prison in New San Antonio in ''[[Ultima II: The Revenge of the Enchantress|Ultima II]]''. He later becomes the Baron and keeper of Serpent Hold, essentially the ruler of all the southern islands. In ''[[Ultima VII]]'', he lives in Britain and is willing to train the Avatar and other companions for free after joining the party. While Sentri does not appear in ''[[Ultima IX: Ascension|Ultima IX]]'', a magical pair of leggings belonging to him can be found in Trinsic.\n* '''Gorn''' is a prisoner in Lord Blackthorn's castle in ''[[Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny|Ultima V]]'' that joins the party and helps them escape. He is found in ''[[Ultima VI: The False Prophet|Ultima VI]]'' in the dungeon under Terfin, at which point he again joins the party. In ''[[Ultima VII]]'', he is found worshiping an entity named Brohm behind the Fellowship Meditation Retreat that the Guardian is impersonating, and tells the Avatar to go away. A barbarian with a distinctive accent, he was based on Arnold Schwarzenegger's portrayal of [[Conan the Barbarian]].\n* '''Johne''''s ship Ararat was swallowed by a great whirlpool and dragged into the Underworld, some time before the beginning of ''Ultima V''. He was driven insane when he discovered the three Shards of the Gem of Immortality, and he killed his three companions. From their blood the three Shadowlords were created. The Avatar finds him stranded in the wreckage. He eagerly asks to join the Avatar's party to avenge his wrongdoing. By Ultima VI, now known as '''Captain John''', he is living in Hythloth, studying the gargoyles and teaching Beh Lem the human language. He sent the silver tablet to Mariah to let the humans understand the gargoyles, but never knew what actually happened to it. Captain John asks the Avatar to help the gargoyles and teaches the hero the Gargish language.\n* '''Maxwell''' is a low-level fighter in Serpent's Hold in ''Ultima V''.\n* '''Toshi''' is a low-level bard in Empath Abbey in ''Ultima V''.\n* '''Saduj''' is a member of Blackthorn's organization \"Oppression\" in ''Ultima V''. If he is allowed to join, he will betray and attack the Avatar's party whenever combat is engaged.\n* '''Seggallion''' is a pirate lord who gives the Avatar the [[monocular|spyglass]] in ''Ultima V''. The Avatar meets him again in ''[[Ultima VI: The False Prophet|Ultima VI]]''. He tells the Avatar that he is a fighter from the realm of Ashtalarea (a world from ''[[Knights of Legend]]''). He says that he was fighting an evil minion in his homeworld and their struggle brought him through a moongate to Britannia. There is no way to send him back to Ashtalarea.\n* '''Beh Lem''' is a young gargoyle who joins the Avatar's party to escort them safely into Vesper and the realm of the gargoyles in ''Ultima VI''.\n* '''Blaine''' is a wandering [[Romani people|gypsy]] juggler who may join the Avatar's party in ''Ultima VI''.\n* '''Leodon''' and '''Leonna''' are two fair-haired ship captains staying in Buccaneer's Den in ''Ultima VI''. They offer to join the Avatar's party and possess good fighting skills and equipment.\n* '''Sherry''' is a talking mouse recruited by the Avatar to scout out small places in ''Ultima VI''. She is later seen as a helper in Lord British's Nursery in ''[[Ultima VII: The Black Gate]]'', commonly found telling children [[nursery rhymes]]. She was based on Sherry Hunter, a former girlfriend of Richard Garriott's who also was the basis for the actress portraying Sherry in a play in ''Ultima VII'' that his alter-ego Shamino's dates.\n* '''Spark''' is a young adolescent in ''Ultima VII'' that asks to join the Avatar's party to help bring his father's murderers to justice. He was based on the son of programmer [[Raymond Benson]].\n* '''Tseramed''' is a ranger in ''Ultima VII'' is adept at killing giant bees and using their venom to make sleep-inducing arrows, earning the anger of a couple living within their hive. If he joins the party, he tells of his grudge against Fellowship leaders Elizabeth & Abraham for causing the death of his lover Lady M. by forbidding her to seek help for severe illness based on Fellowship mistrust of healers. He is based on Ken Demarest III, the lead programmer for ''Ultima VII'', who frequently used ''Tseramed'' as his online pseudonym.\n* '''Selina''' is an adept from Moonshade in ''[[Ultima VII Part Two: Serpent Isle]]''. She may have her own reason to join the Avatar's party.\n* '''Boydon''' is a Frankenstein-like being in ''Ultima VII Part Two'' who used to be Erstam's assistant but ended up as his experiment subject and was hacked to pieces yet kept still alive. He can join the Avatar after his body is put back together.\n* '''Stefano''' is a magic thief that helps the Avatar escape the Mountains of Freedom in ''Ultima VII Part Two''.\n* '''Wilfred''' is a Bear Knight of Monitor in ''Ultima VII Part Two''. He may be asked to join the party later in the game, but may not be what he appears to be.\n* '''Petra''' is an automaton in Moonshade in ''Ultima VII Part Two''. She helps Rocco run the Blue Boar. She is needed later in the game to help the Avatar with the quest.\n* '''Sethys''' has been kept alive for centuries in the Temple of Tolerance in ''Ultima VII Part Two''. He helps the Avatar in summoning the shade of the Hierophant of Chaos.\n* A regular iron '''automaton''' can be animated with the ''Create Automaton'' spell and added as a member of the party in ''Ultima VII Part Two''.\n* '''Raven''' is Samhayne's secret daughter. Initially the Avatar is double-crossed and gets arrested by Blackthorn for a task given by Samhayne. However, Raven and Samhayne choose to support the Avatar afterwards. Raven even lets the Avatar navigate her ship, The Silver Hart, to various places. Later in the game she gets intimate with the Avatar. They eventually say goodbye when the Avatar goes to the final battle against the Guardian.\n\n===''Worlds of Ultima'' companions===\n*'''Dr. Johann Spector''' is a friend of the Avatar's from Earth. He becomes corrupted by the power of the Valley of Eodon in ''[[Worlds of Ultima: The Savage Empire|Ultima: Savage Empire]]'' and declares himself leader of the most powerful tribal village, where he goes by the name Zipactriotl. He plans to unite an army of the insect like creatures, the Myrmidex, to launch an assault on Earth and conquer it. When the Avatar breaks the spell on him, Zipactriotl becomes Dr. Spector again and joins the Avatar's party. He later goes with the Avatar to Mars in ''[[Ultima: Worlds of Adventure 2: Martian Dreams|Ultima: Martian Dreams]]''. He was based on [[Warren Spector]] who for a time worked for Origin.\n\n==Arch-enemies==\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n\n* Yes : The character is in that game.\n* No : The character is not in that game.\n* M/R : The character is only mentioned or referenced in that game.\n* Mnl : The character is only referenced in the game manual.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

He is born as the second son of Wolfgang, the king of the city-state of Akalabeth. Taught by his father, he masters basic magic, learning to control minor creatures, but as he doesn't show compassion, his father bans him from using magic. Mondain quickly retaliates by killing his father and stealing his gem, which he uses to create the \"Gem of Immortality.\" As his power grows, he gains more control over the minions of darkness. He creates many strange, hybrid creatures in his dark laboratories, including [[minotaur]]s, [[List of reptilian humanoids|lizardmen]], [[orcs]], and [[goblins]]. Mondain's castle is on an island called Terfin.\n\nAfter being defeated by Lord British, he summons as many creatures as he can in order to conquer Sosaria. Due to the Gem of Immortality, Mondain cannot be killed in the present time, and he cannot be killed without destroying the gem. The Stranger from Another World uses a time machine to travel back in time 1000 years to when Mondain was first creating the gem. The Stranger manages to destroy Mondain's gem and slay him. Mondain's castle is destroyed in the process.\n\nShattering the Gem of Immortality forms the basis of two later games, ''[[Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny]]'' and ''[[Ultima Online]]''. Three shards of the gem are found at the location of the sunken remnants of Terfin in ''[[Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar]]'', along with Mondain's skull. The shards later form the Shadowlords in ''Ultima V'' and are necessary to defeat them; the skull in ''Ultima IV'' kills all creatures within an area, also hurting the Avatar's karma. In ''Ultima Online'', many different shards exist, all of which are [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]] containing Britannia.\n\nIn ''Ultima Online'' and ''[[Ultima IX: Ascension]]'', Mondain is depicted as bald with a goatee, bearing a resemblance to [[Ming the Merciless]]. In ''[[Ultima VI: The False Prophet|Ultima VI]]'', however, he is depicted as having a full head of hair and no facial hair.\n\n===Minax===\n'''Minax''', the beautiful but evil sorceress, is the main enemy of ''[[Ultima II: The Revenge of the Enchantress]]'' as well as in ''[[Ultima Online]]''.\n\nUnderestimated because of her youth, Minax was furious at the death of her tutor and revenge set itself within her dark heart. As her talent for magic and capacity of malevolence far exceeded Mondain's, Minax decided to take control of the evils of the world without the gem. Showing huge magical potential in her youth, Minax was recruited as an apprentice by Mondain. The young sorceress later fell in love with the wizard. She survived her paramour's death at the hands of the Stranger (the event of ''[[Ultima I: The First Age of Darkness|Ultima I]]'') and went into hiding. Ten years later, Minax is now older and very powerful, more than Mondain once was. Minax wants to avenge the death of Mondain; thus, after much research, she learns of the Stranger's homeworld. To destroy her \"bane's homeworld\", she uses dimensional and time gates to set up the Time of Legends, a place located at the Origin of Times. Thus she will be able to attack everybody living \"after\" this period in that reality without risking being killed like Mondain, since it is impossible to travel in time to before the Origin of Times. To ensure the Stranger would not interfere with her plans for vengeance, Minax invaded his homeworld of Earth. Once there, she used her dark powers to disturb the fabric of time and destroyed the planet. After the Stranger's death, she would be able to conquer Sosaria easily. Twenty years after the death of Mondain, Minax invaded Sosaria with her legions of Darkness.\n\nIn ''Ultima II'', Lord British called for a hero to crush Minax's evil plans. The Stranger, having narrowly escaped the destruction of Earth, answered British's call. Minax's castle, named Shadowguard, could only be reached through timegates (similar to moongates in the later games); even then an enchanted ring was required to pass through the force fields inside. The war against Minax's vile legions was long and hard, but eventually the hero hunted down the sorceress, pursued her as she teleported throughout the castle, and destroyed her with the quicksword Enilno. With the dark energies released with the death of Minax, the lands of Sosaria changed once again, reforming into two continents: Sosaria proper and Ambrosia. But unbeknownst to all, Mondain and Minax had produced a [[Offspring|progeny]], [[Exodus (Ultima)|Exodus]] - an entity that was neither man nor machine.\n\n===Exodus===\n'''Exodus''' is the eponymous villain of ''[[Ultima III: Exodus]]'', the creation of both Mondain and Minax. The first sign of the character's appearance is a missing ship, which returns with the crew completely gone and the word \"EXODUS\" written in blood on the deck of the ship. Exodus then summons creatures to terrorize Sosaria from its castle on the Isle of Fire. Twenty years after Minax's death, the Stranger returns to Sosaria to destroy Exodus.\n\nThe passage through the Isle of Fire is blocked by the trapped Great Earth Serpent. The Stranger yells the correct magic word to set the serpent free; the Great Earth Serpent reappears to assist the Avatar in ''[[Ultima VII Part Two: Serpent Isle]]'', grateful for being freed. Castle Exodus is protected by various magical barriers, requiring the Stranger's party to obtain marks in order to safely pass through. In addition to various creatures that attack the party, the floor itself comes to life and also attacks.\n\nExodus is depicted as having a [[demon]]ic appearance, however the Stranger realizes in the game that Exodus is not a normal living creature. Instead, Exodus is a magical computer that can only be destroyed by inserting the four cards of Love, Sol, Moons, and Death into its four slots. After destroying Exodus, the Isle of Fire sinks into the ocean until ''[[Ultima VII: The Black Gate]]''.\n\nIn the [[Forge of Virtue]] expansion of ''Ultima VII'', the Dark Core of Exodus remains on the island. In order to complete the quests for the add-on, the Avatar must banish the Dark Core into the Ethereal Void.\n\n===Lord Blackthorn===\n'''Lord Blackthorn''' becomes regent of Britannia when Lord British disappears while exploring the Underworld in ''[[Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny|Ultima V]]''. Originally, he is a wise and just ruler, but he is twisted by the Shadowlords and becomes an oppressive [[tyrant]]. By the game's conclusion, Lord British is restored to his throne and Blackthorn sent to [[exile]] through a red moongate to an unknown world. ''[[Ultima VII Part Two: Serpent Isle]]'' explains that his destination is the Serpent Isle. While on Serpent Isle, Blackthorn takes refuge among the Xenkan Monks and finds redemption, eventually joining their order. But ''Ultima IX'' diverges from this restoration of Lord Blackthorn having him leave the island before the Avatar arrives on the Serpent Island. Blackthorn returns again as a villain in ''[[Ultima IX: Ascension]]'', this time as a servant of the Guardian, which again contradicts the restorative end on ''Ultima VII: Part Two: Serpent Isle''. In the end Blackthorn perishes at the hand of [[Lord British]] after an extensive magical duel at the center of the Great Stygian Abyss, completely contradicting everything written prior to Ascension and after ''Ultima VII''.\n\nIn ''[[Ultima Online]]'', the timeline of which diverges from the main series after ''[[Ultima I: The First Age of Darkness|Ultima I]]'', Blackthorn is the closest friend of Lord British, but at the same time he is also his fiercest enemy. He has been defending the peoples' individuality and freedom of belief by creating his own virtue, chaos. In this case, chaos does not represent the destructive force with which it is usually associated. He eventually forged an alliance with various dark magics and emerged as an evil force. After \"surviving\" through a few years, he was seemingly killed in an assault on the city of Yew. The evil form was later retconned into being an facsimile, and the original Lord Blackthorn became the king of Britannia. Lord Blackthorn was the virtual persona of Ultima Online project director [[Starr Long]].\n\n===The Shadowlords===\n\n===The Guardian===\n'''The Guardian''' is an alien being of immense power from another dimension. A large red humanoid, he is described as a conqueror of worlds. He first appears in ''[[Ultima VII: The Black Gate]]'' although for the majority of the game he is only a disembodied voice. Having conquered other worlds, he first attempts to conquer Britannia through his agent Batlin, the founder and leader of the Fellowship. The ultimate plan was to create a black moongate to allow the Guardian to physically enter Britannia and conquer it. The Avatar discovers the Guardian's plan and destroys the black moongate as the Guardian is attempting to enter.\n\nOne year later, in ''[[Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds]]'', the Guardian attempted to conquer Britannia again by creating a blackrock dome around Castle Britannia and trapping the Avatar and his companions inside. The Guardian planned to send troops through a portal within the castle to conquer Britannia by killing its leaders first. The Avatar defeated the Guardian by destroying the portal and the dome. During the course of the game, the Avatar visited several worlds already conquered or destroyed by the Guardian.\n\nIt was revealed in ''[[Ultima VII Part Two: Serpent Isle]]'' that the Guardian had a backup plan and had sent Batlin to the Serpent Isle to further his plans to conquer Britannia. Batlin attempts to betray the Guardian and is killed for his disloyalty but not before releasing the apocalyptic forces of the Banes of Chaos. The Avatar ends the threat by reuniting the Chaos, Order, and Balance Serpents. At the end of the game, the Avatar is captured by the Guardian.\n\nIn ''[[Ultima VIII: Pagan]]'', the Guardian trapped the Avatar on Pagan, a world completely under the control of the Guardian. The Avatar eventually masters the different elemental magic of this world and returns to Britannia.\n\nIn ''[[Ultima IX: Ascension]]'', it is learned that while the Avatar was trapped on Pagan, the Guardian has managed to erect eight huge columns throughout Britannia, in order to pull the two moons out of orbit, crashing into the planet and destroying it. The Avatar destroys the eight columns and defeats the Guardian. In the final battle, the Guardian reveals that he is the Avatar's other half, created from the evil part of the Avatar abandoned at the conclusion of ''[[Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar|Ultima IV]]''. The Avatar defeats the Guardian by using the Armageddon spell to fuse the two of them into one new being.\n\nFans and chroniclers of the ''Ultima'' series have speculated that the Guardian was a satirical metaphor for Origin's parent company, [[Electronic Arts]], which had been rumored to be stifling [[Richard Garriott]]'s creative control over the last installments of the series. Supporting this theory is the fact that the three artifacts of the Guardian, first seen in ''[[Ultima VII: The Black Gate]]'', are the sphere, the cube, and the tetrahedron, which together are an unmistakable representation of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120306204357/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/eb/Electronic_Arts_historical_logo.svg/300px-Electronic_Arts_historical_logo.svg.png EA logo] during the early 1990s when EA's acquisition of Origin was complete and the games were developed. Furthermore, two members of the Fellowship in The Black Gate, Elizabeth and Abraham (E&A) provide dubious guidance for the Avatar throughout the game and are ultimately unmasked as evildoers.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Conquest of Origin |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_14/87-The-Conquest-of-Origin |title=The Escapist : |publisher=Escapistmagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-17}}</ref> The Guardian is described as the \"Destroyer of Worlds\", a possible reference to Origin's tagline which read \"We create worlds\".\n\n===Batlin===\n\n==Other significant or recurring characters==\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n\n* Yes : The character is in that game.\n* No : The character is not in that game.\n* AE : An alter-ego of the character is in that game.\n* M/R : The character is only mentioned or referenced in that game.\n* Mnl : The character is only referenced in the game manual.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

He is still known as Lord British even after his departure from ''Ultima'' maker [[Origin Systems]]: Garriott retained the trademark rights to the name Lord British with its associated symbols, and the character appeared in his latest (and now defunct) online game, ''[[Tabula Rasa (video game)|Tabula Rasa]]'' as General British.\n\nLord British is a man who comes from [[Earth]] to [[Sosaria]] through a moongate. He adopts the name Cantabrigian British, taken from his birthplace, [[Cambridge]] in the [[United Kingdom]], in favor of his old name. He quickly meets the evil wizard, Mondain, and does battle with him. After defeating him, British becomes known as \"Champion of the White Light\" and \"Lord British, Protector of Akalabeth.\" Numerous plotlines and side-quests in the ''Ultima'' games revolve around one of Lord British's adventures or public works projects. He had a key role in founding the Museum, Conservatory, and innumerable institutions of the Britannian society. He also continuously provides [[healing]], [[resurrection]] and other miscellaneous help for the Avatar.\n\nOne of the most famous characteristics of Lord British is that he is (supposedly) indestructible. In the past, he has been killed as a result of various glitches and exploits.<ref name=computerandvideogames>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=181917 |title=PC Feature: The Many Deaths of Lord British |publisher=ComputerAndVideoGames.com |date=2008-02-10 |accessdate=2012-02-14}}</ref>  This fact has led to the naming of the \"Lord British Postulate\", a postulate that in any game if a creature is alive, someone somewhere will try to kill it. Most of the games in the series require the use of glitches to kill the character, and Garriott was less than pleased after learning that the character can be lured to be killed by cannon fire in ''[[Ultima III: Exodus]]''.<ref>The Official Book of Ultima page 30 and 31</ref> During ''[[Ultima VII]]'', an easter egg allows British to be killed by a falling gold plaque, which is a reference to an incident at the Origin building; a metal bar, where the magnet on the door attached to it, fell on Garriott's head, warranting a visit to the hospital. One of the characters says, \"Yancey-Hausman will pay!\" which is a reference to the owner and landlord of the building.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dino's Ultima Page - Ultima 7 Guide - Fun - The Bar that killed the King |url=http://gigi.nullneuron.net/ultima/u7bg/u7fun.killlb.php |author=Joe Garrity |date=2003-07-27 |quote= |accessdate=2008-08-25}}</ref> During ''[[Ultima Online]]'''s [[development stage|beta test]], Garriott's character was killed by various bugs and an oversight on Garriott's part.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aschulze.net/ultima/stories9/beta.htm|title=Ultima Online Travelogues: Ultima Online Beta|accessdate=2006-08-17|author=Hawkeye Pike |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060618223856/http://www.aschulze.net/ultima/stories9/beta.htm |archivedate = June 18, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bannister|first=Paul|title=Ultima Online: Interview with Rainz, The Man Who Killed Lord British|url=http://noctalis.com/dis/uo/blast02a.shtml|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> This is considered to be a major event within online gaming, as it gave \"players an unprecedented ability to change and influence the game.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Brad King |url=https://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/news/2002/06/52894 |title=Make Love, Not War Games |publisher=Wired.com |date= 2002-06-08|accessdate=2012-02-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/technology/7561553.stm | work=BBC News | title=Writing the history of virtual worlds | date=2008-08-15 | accessdate=2010-05-11}}</ref> General British of Tabula Rasa was also killed during beta testing.<ref name=computerandvideogames/>\nIn ''Ultima IX: Ascension'', Lord British may be killed by making a poisoned loaf of bread with the rat poison and the bread maker on Earth, and then by replacing his loaf of bread with it.\n\n===Chuckles===\n'''Chuckles''' is Lord British's court jester. He is often found in Castle Britannia. At times, he helps the Avatar, yet he is known to have led the Avatar to a wild goose chase. He is based on Chuck Bueche, one of the founders of Origin Systems.\n\n===The Time Lord===\n'''The Time Lord''' is a powerful being who ensures the smooth and orderly flow of time through space.

He has become Seer of Souls in ''Ultima IV'' and resides in Castle Britannia. He guides the Stranger in the path to Avatarhood. He appears again in ''Ultima IX'', and more to his background is told.\n\n===Smith===\nA talking horse.\n\n===Wisps===\n\n===Nystul===\n\n===Lord Draxinusom===\n\n===Arcadion===\n\n===Other characters in the series===\n\n* '''The King of the White Dragon''' shares the rulership of the Lands of Danger and Despair (later known as Serpent Isle) with Shamino in ''[[Ultima I]]''. By ''[[Ultima VII Part Two: Serpent Isle]]'', it is revealed that Shamino was in love with the King of the White Dragon's daughter Beatrix back in ''Ultima I''. When Mondain was defeated, the lands of old Sosaria thundered apart. Shamino at the time was at the Lands of Lord British and could not return to his own land ever since. As a result, Beatrix later died of a broken heart. The King of the White Dragon went mad with grief, and tortured and murdered everyone in his castle's grand banquet for the Solstice Festival amid the goblin invasion. At the end, he flung himself from the tower of his castle. When the Avatar tries to enter his castle in ''Ultima VII Part Two'', his mad ghost appears and tries to kill the hero. His ghost is finally put to rest after a hard battle.\n* '''Sir Simon'''\n* '''Lady Tessa'''\n* '''Gwenneth''' is Iolo's apprentice and works in his shop, Iolo's Bows, in Britain. She manages the shop with Gwenno in ''Ultima V'' when Iolo has been made an outlaw by Blackthorn. By ''Ultima VI'', she has taken over the shop since Iolo's retirement.\n* '''Dr. Cat'''\n* '''Sutek'''\n* '''Sin'Vraal'''\n* '''Nicodemus'''\n* '''Rudyom'''\n* '''Penumbra'''\n* '''Horance'''\n* '''Nell'''\n* '''Patterson'''\n* '''Nastassia'''\n* '''Erstam'''\n* '''Beatrix''''s story is told in ''Ultima VII Part Two''. She was the daughter of the King of the White Dragon and the betrothed of Shamino back in the time of ''Ultima I''. Shamino unfortunately got stranded in the Lands of Lord British due to ancient Sosaria sundering apart from the defeat of Mondain at the hand of the Stranger. Beatrix eventually died of a broken heart in Shamino's castle, which causes her father, the King, to go mad and slay everyone in his castle amid the goblin invasion. Beatrix's spirit remained in Shamino's abandoned castle. In ''Ultima VII Part Two'', Shamino accompanied the Avatar to Serpent Isle.

The Avatar is first known as the '''''Stranger from another world''''', who defeats Mondain, Minax, and their spawn, Exodus. The Stranger becomes the Avatar once his goal changes to following the path of the Virtues, and retrieving the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom from the Great Stygian Abyss. This is noted as one of the first uses of \"Avatar\" in the virtual context.<ref>My Avatar, My Self: Identity in Video Role-Playing Games By Zach Waggoner, Chapter notes, page 185</ref> In the fifth episode, the Avatar defeats a repressive regime over Britannia, and in the sixth he brings peace between men and gargoyles. In the first part of the seventh episode, the Avatar infiltrates the Fellowship in order to stop the Guardian from entering Britannia; in the second part, the Avatar prevents imbalance from destroying the universe and receives the title of the Hierophant of Balance. In the eighth episode, the Avatar escapes the world of Pagan by defeating the four Titans, becoming the Titan of Ether. In the ninth and final episode, the Avatar defeats the Guardian by destroying both himself and the Guardian with the Armageddon spell. The Avatar is also the main character in both ''[[Ultima Underworld]]'' games.\n\nThe Avatar can be customized as a male or female in many of the games. Later games allow the customization of skin and hair color as well. The default Avatar is depicted as a blond-haired, blue-eyed male. The character is noted as the first to have a selection between genders and races, and the female version is noted to be \"feminine, but not hypersexual.\"<ref>Gender Inclusive Game Design: Expanding the Market, by Sheri Graner Ray, page 27</ref> The Avatar's trademark clothing often includes a suit of [[chain mail]], with a white, red or orange [[tunic]] over it, and a red cape. An [[ankh]] is usually part of the Avatar's clothing. Typically, the character is also shown wielding a sword. In ''[[Ultima VIII: Pagan|Ultima VIII]]'', the Avatar's face is obscured by a large helmet. The Avatar is voiced by J.C. Shakespeare in ''[[Ultima IX: Ascension|Ultima IX]]''.\n\nThe Avatar was initially designed to be a blank slate through which players could reflect their own personality<ref>{{cite web|author= Jesse Schedeen |url=http://uk.stars.ign.com/articles/907/907102p8.html |title=Players Wanted: Ultimate Fighting Game - Stars Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.stars.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref> ''Ultima'' was one of the first computer games to allow players to choose their gender and race.<ref>Gender Inclusive Game Design: Expanding the Market , by Sheri Graner Ray, page 27</ref> However, the Avatar eventually evolved to take on a more specific appearance and character.<ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/features/tenspot_heroes/hero2.html Ten Best Heroes in Gaming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710004638/http://www.gamespot.com/features/tenspot_heroes/hero2.html |date=2007-07-10 }}</ref>\n\n===The Eight Companions {{anchor|The Companions of the Avatar}}===\nThe Eight Companions are the ones who join the Stranger in his quest to attain the Avatarhood in ''[[Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar|Ultima IV]]'' (in fact, only seven of them join the Stranger in the game; the one who has the same profession as the Stranger will not join the party, as that profession's role is fulfilled by the Stranger). They are special in the way that each of them originally practices a particular profession which connects with one of the eight virtues and the town of that virtue. They are the Avatar's first ever followers, and many of them join the Avatar again in subsequent adventures. Starting from ''Ultima IV'', the Eight Companions appear in all the primary games of the series that are set in Britannia, i.e., ''Ultima IV'', ''V'', ''VI'', ''VII (Part I)'' and ''IX'', and many of them can be asked to join the Avatar's party in these games. Some of them take up other professions in later games.\n* '''Iolo''' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|j|o\u028a|l|o\u028a}} is one of the most famed [[bard]]s in Britannia, and a [[bowyer]] famous for his [[crossbow]]s. He lives in Britain in ''Ultima IV''. While he and Gwenno have always been in the game series and seen together since ''Ultima II'', they are finally revealed to be husband and wife in the manual of ''Ultima V'' where his full name is revealed to be '''Iolo FitzOwen'''. He is the creator of the music for the famous song, \"Stones\", for which Gwenno wrote the lyrics. He owns the talking horse, Smith, who constantly makes sarcastic comments about the Avatar. By ''Ultima VII'' he has owned two bow shops. He is based on the real life bowyer and composer [[David R. Watson]].\n* '''Shamino Sall\u00e9 Dacil''' is a ranger living in Skara Brae. Originally, he was a ruler of one of the eight kingdoms of ancient Sosaria. He and the King of the White Dragon shared the rulership of the Lands of Danger and Despair. Some time after meeting the Stranger and assisting him in his quest in ''Ultima I'', he set out to meet his old friend, Lord British. He got trapped in Britannia when Mondain's defeat led to the separation of the four Sosarian continents, leaving his lover, Beatrix, behind. He has become a ranger by ''Ultima IV''. Shamino accompanies the Avatar to the Serpent Isle in ''Ultima VII Part II'', which turns out to be the old Lands of Danger and Despair. Beatrix's ghost appears to him, initially hostile, but eventually forgives him for leaving, and departs to the afterlife after giving him a book of love sonnets. He later is trapped by the Guardian in the void, but is freed by the Avatar at the end. Shamino is based on Richard Garriott, as it is his persona name in the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]]. He took the name from his bicycle, a [[Shimano]]. A sequence in ''[[Ultima VI: The False Prophet|Ultima VI]]'' has a conversation between the NPC Finn who also looks like Garriot that references that both he, Shamino and Lord British are the same person.\n* '''Dupre''' is a [[paladin]] and the mayor of the town of Trinsic. He joins the Stranger on his quest to become the Avatar. He becomes a regular companion for the following games. He is knighted sometime between ''Ultima VI'' and ''Ultima VII''. In ''Ultima V'', he is found hiding on the island of Bordermarch. Being quite fond of wine and women, he often stays in taverns while not traveling, and he even does a study for a series of travel guides. In ''Ultima VII'', he runs up a substantial bar tab, and the Avatar has the option of paying it off. He eventually sacrifices himself to save Serpent Isle, and he is later resurrected to help fight the Guardian in ''Ultima IX''. He is based on Richard Garriott's real-life friend Greg Dykes.\n* '''Jaana''' is a [[druid]] and a friend of Lord British. Once Blackthorn takes over, she is declared as an outlaw, and actively works with the resistance against him. She later moves to Cove and becomes the local healer, and later helps fight against the Guardian. Richard Garriott named her after a friend of his from [[Finland]] with the same name.\n* '''Julia''' is a [[tinker]] with a [[Scottish English|Scottish accent]] first found in Minoc. In ''Ultima VII'', she helps uncover the flaws in Owen's shipbuilding. In ''Ultima IX'', the one game in the ''Ultima'' series in which the Avatar cannot be female, she confesses she was in love with him. She is based on someone Garriott once dated.\n* '''Katrina''' is a [[shepherd]], and the only survivor of the [[Demon|daemon]] attack that destroyed the island port city of Magincia. She still lives in the ruins of the destroyed city. Later, Magincia is resettled as New Magincia, a simple agricultural community that, unlike its predecessor, embraces the virtue of Humility. Katrina becomes one of its first citizens. She later ends up as the only citizen after it is abandoned, and the Avatar helps restore Humility to the area. She is based on a friend of Richard Garriott's that goes by the nickname Trina.\n* '''Geoffrey''' is a [[warrior|fighter]] first met in Jhelom. He becomes captain of the guard, and helps defend against gargoyles. He eventually retires to Lord British's castle. Geoffrey is based on Jeff Hillhouse, Origin's first and last employee.\n* '''Mariah''' is a [[Magician (fantasy)|mage]] and a resident of Moonglow. She seeks adventure, and after being attacked by Shadowlords, she hides in Lycaeum and meets the Avatar. In ''Ultima VI'', she can translate the two pieces of the Gargoyles' tablet. After insanity affects many of the mages in the area, she is very depressed, though the Avatar manages to fix the problems. Mariah is based on Richard Garriott's real-life personal assistant, Michelle Caddel.\n\n===Other companions===\nApart from the Eight Companions, the Avatar may ask other characters to join his party starting from ''Ultima V''. Some of these characters may have been appearing in the game series a number of times already, and some may join the Avatar in multiple games, while others may appear only once in the series. In some cases, minor NPCs join the party only for a very short period of time. Yet some of them may play a major role and be part of the party throughout the entire game.\n* '''Gwenno'''{{efn|name=\"gwenno\"}} is an entertainer, scholar and an explorer, who appears frequently with her husband Iolo in the series. She joins the Avatar's party to accompany her husband from time to time. In the ''Ultima V'' game manual, she is listed as having written the lyrics to the song \"''Stones''\",<ref>Dungeons and desktops: the history of computer role-playing games, by Matt Barton, page 117</ref> and her full name is '''Gwenllian Gwalch'gaeaf'''. She was based on Kathleen Jones, the real-life wife of David R. Watson (Iolo).\n* '''Sentri''' is a fighter and occasional companion of the Avatar. He first appears as Sentri the Swashbuckler in the prison in New San Antonio in ''[[Ultima II: The Revenge of the Enchantress|Ultima II]]''. He later becomes the Baron and keeper of Serpent Hold, essentially the ruler of all the southern islands. In ''[[Ultima VII]]'', he lives in Britain and is willing to train the Avatar and other companions for free after joining the party. While Sentri does not appear in ''[[Ultima IX: Ascension|Ultima IX]]'', a magical pair of leggings belonging to him can be found in Trinsic.\n* '''Gorn''' is a prisoner in Lord Blackthorn's castle in ''[[Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny|Ultima V]]'' that joins the party and helps them escape. He is found in ''[[Ultima VI: The False Prophet|Ultima VI]]'' in the dungeon under Terfin, at which point he again joins the party. In ''[[Ultima VII]]'', he is found worshiping an entity named Brohm behind the Fellowship Meditation Retreat that the Guardian is impersonating, and tells the Avatar to go away. A barbarian with a distinctive accent, he was based on Arnold Schwarzenegger's portrayal of [[Conan the Barbarian]].\n* '''Johne''''s ship Ararat was swallowed by a great whirlpool and dragged into the Underworld, some time before the beginning of ''Ultima V''. He was driven insane when he discovered the three Shards of the Gem of Immortality, and he killed his three companions. From their blood the three Shadowlords were created. The Avatar finds him stranded in the wreckage. He eagerly asks to join the Avatar's party to avenge his wrongdoing. By Ultima VI, now known as '''Captain John''', he is living in Hythloth, studying the gargoyles and teaching Beh Lem the human language. He sent the silver tablet to Mariah to let the humans understand the gargoyles, but never knew what actually happened to it. Captain John asks the Avatar to help the gargoyles and teaches the hero the Gargish language.\n* '''Maxwell''' is a low-level fighter in Serpent's Hold in ''Ultima V''.\n* '''Toshi''' is a low-level bard in Empath Abbey in ''Ultima V''.\n* '''Saduj''' is a member of Blackthorn's organization \"Oppression\" in ''Ultima V''. If he is allowed to join, he will betray and attack the Avatar's party whenever combat is engaged.\n* '''Seggallion''' is a pirate lord who gives the Avatar the [[monocular|spyglass]] in ''Ultima V''. The Avatar meets him again in ''[[Ultima VI: The False Prophet|Ultima VI]]''. He tells the Avatar that he is a fighter from the realm of Ashtalarea (a world from ''[[Knights of Legend]]''). He says that he was fighting an evil minion in his homeworld and their struggle brought him through a moongate to Britannia. There is no way to send him back to Ashtalarea.\n* '''Beh Lem''' is a young gargoyle who joins the Avatar's party to escort them safely into Vesper and the realm of the gargoyles in ''Ultima VI''.\n* '''Blaine''' is a wandering [[Romani people|gypsy]] juggler who may join the Avatar's party in ''Ultima VI''.\n* '''Leodon''' and '''Leonna''' are two fair-haired ship captains staying in Buccaneer's Den in ''Ultima VI''. They offer to join the Avatar's party and possess good fighting skills and equipment.\n* '''Sherry''' is a talking mouse recruited by the Avatar to scout out small places in ''Ultima VI''. She is later seen as a helper in Lord British's Nursery in ''[[Ultima VII: The Black Gate]]'', commonly found telling children [[nursery rhymes]]. She was based on Sherry Hunter, a former girlfriend of Richard Garriott's who also was the basis for the actress portraying Sherry in a play in ''Ultima VII'' that his alter-ego Shamino's dates.\n* '''Spark''' is a young adolescent in ''Ultima VII'' that asks to join the Avatar's party to help bring his father's murderers to justice. He was based on the son of programmer [[Raymond Benson]].\n* '''Tseramed''' is a ranger in ''Ultima VII'' is adept at killing giant bees and using their venom to make sleep-inducing arrows, earning the anger of a couple living within their hive. If he joins the party, he tells of his grudge against Fellowship leaders Elizabeth & Abraham for causing the death of his lover Lady M. by forbidding her to seek help for severe illness based on Fellowship mistrust of healers. He is based on Ken Demarest III, the lead programmer for ''Ultima VII'', who frequently used ''Tseramed'' as his online pseudonym.\n* '''Selina''' is an adept from Moonshade in ''[[Ultima VII Part Two: Serpent Isle]]''. She may have her own reason to join the Avatar's party.\n* '''Boydon''' is a Frankenstein-like being in ''Ultima VII Part Two'' who used to be Erstam's assistant but ended up as his experiment subject and was hacked to pieces yet kept still alive. He can join the Avatar after his body is put back together.\n* '''Stefano''' is a magic thief that helps the Avatar escape the Mountains of Freedom in ''Ultima VII Part Two''.\n* '''Wilfred''' is a Bear Knight of Monitor in ''Ultima VII Part Two''. He may be asked to join the party later in the game, but may not be what he appears to be.\n* '''Petra''' is an automaton in Moonshade in ''Ultima VII Part Two''. She helps Rocco run the Blue Boar. She is needed later in the game to help the Avatar with the quest.\n* '''Sethys''' has been kept alive for centuries in the Temple of Tolerance in ''Ultima VII Part Two''. He helps the Avatar in summoning the shade of the Hierophant of Chaos.\n* A regular iron '''automaton''' can be animated with the ''Create Automaton'' spell and added as a member of the party in ''Ultima VII Part Two''.\n* '''Raven''' is Samhayne's secret daughter. Initially the Avatar is double-crossed and gets arrested by Blackthorn for a task given by Samhayne. However, Raven and Samhayne choose to support the Avatar afterwards. Raven even lets the Avatar navigate her ship, The Silver Hart, to various places. Later in the game she gets intimate with the Avatar. They eventually say goodbye when the Avatar goes to the final battle against the Guardian.\n\n===''Worlds of Ultima'' companions===\n*'''Dr. Johann Spector''' is a friend of the Avatar's from Earth. He becomes corrupted by the power of the Valley of Eodon in ''[[Worlds of Ultima: The Savage Empire|Ultima: Savage Empire]]'' and declares himself leader of the most powerful tribal village, where he goes by the name Zipactriotl. He plans to unite an army of the insect like creatures, the Myrmidex, to launch an assault on Earth and conquer it. When the Avatar breaks the spell on him, Zipactriotl becomes Dr. Spector again and joins the Avatar's party. He later goes with the Avatar to Mars in ''[[Ultima: Worlds of Adventure 2: Martian Dreams|Ultima: Martian Dreams]]''. He was based on [[Warren Spector]] who for a time worked for Origin.\n\n==Arch-enemies==\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n\n* Yes : The character is in that game.\n* No : The character is not in that game.\n* M/R : The character is only mentioned or referenced in that game.\n* Mnl : The character is only referenced in the game manual.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

He is born as the second son of Wolfgang, the king of the city-state of Akalabeth. Taught by his father, he masters basic magic, learning to control minor creatures, but as he doesn't show compassion, his father bans him from using magic. Mondain quickly retaliates by killing his father and stealing his gem, which he uses to create the \"Gem of Immortality.\" As his power grows, he gains more control over the minions of darkness. He creates many strange, hybrid creatures in his dark laboratories, including [[minotaur]]s, [[List of reptilian humanoids|lizardmen]], [[orcs]], and [[goblins]]. Mondain's castle is on an island called Terfin.\n\nAfter being defeated by Lord British, he summons as many creatures as he can in order to conquer Sosaria. Due to the Gem of Immortality, Mondain cannot be killed in the present time, and he cannot be killed without destroying the gem. The Stranger from Another World uses a time machine to travel back in time 1000 years to when Mondain was first creating the gem. The Stranger manages to destroy Mondain's gem and slay him. Mondain's castle is destroyed in the process.\n\nShattering the Gem of Immortality forms the basis of two later games, ''[[Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny]]'' and ''[[Ultima Online]]''. Three shards of the gem are found at the location of the sunken remnants of Terfin in ''[[Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar]]'', along with Mondain's skull. The shards later form the Shadowlords in ''Ultima V'' and are necessary to defeat them; the skull in ''Ultima IV'' kills all creatures within an area, also hurting the Avatar's karma. In ''Ultima Online'', many different shards exist, all of which are [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]] containing Britannia.\n\nIn ''Ultima Online'' and ''[[Ultima IX: Ascension]]'', Mondain is depicted as bald with a goatee, bearing a resemblance to [[Ming the Merciless]]. In ''[[Ultima VI: The False Prophet|Ultima VI]]'', however, he is depicted as having a full head of hair and no facial hair.\n\n===Minax===\n'''Minax''', the beautiful but evil sorceress, is the main enemy of ''[[Ultima II: The Revenge of the Enchantress]]'' as well as in ''[[Ultima Online]]''.\n\nUnderestimated because of her youth, Minax was furious at the death of her tutor and revenge set itself within her dark heart. As her talent for magic and capacity of malevolence far exceeded Mondain's, Minax decided to take control of the evils of the world without the gem. Showing huge magical potential in her youth, Minax was recruited as an apprentice by Mondain. The young sorceress later fell in love with the wizard. She survived her paramour's death at the hands of the Stranger (the event of ''[[Ultima I: The First Age of Darkness|Ultima I]]'') and went into hiding. Ten years later, Minax is now older and very powerful, more than Mondain once was. Minax wants to avenge the death of Mondain; thus, after much research, she learns of the Stranger's homeworld. To destroy her \"bane's homeworld\", she uses dimensional and time gates to set up the Time of Legends, a place located at the Origin of Times. Thus she will be able to attack everybody living \"after\" this period in that reality without risking being killed like Mondain, since it is impossible to travel in time to before the Origin of Times. To ensure the Stranger would not interfere with her plans for vengeance, Minax invaded his homeworld of Earth. Once there, she used her dark powers to disturb the fabric of time and destroyed the planet. After the Stranger's death, she would be able to conquer Sosaria easily. Twenty years after the death of Mondain, Minax invaded Sosaria with her legions of Darkness.\n\nIn ''Ultima II'', Lord British called for a hero to crush Minax's evil plans. The Stranger, having narrowly escaped the destruction of Earth, answered British's call. Minax's castle, named Shadowguard, could only be reached through timegates (similar to moongates in the later games); even then an enchanted ring was required to pass through the force fields inside. The war against Minax's vile legions was long and hard, but eventually the hero hunted down the sorceress, pursued her as she teleported throughout the castle, and destroyed her with the quicksword Enilno. With the dark energies released with the death of Minax, the lands of Sosaria changed once again, reforming into two continents: Sosaria proper and Ambrosia. But unbeknownst to all, Mondain and Minax had produced a [[Offspring|progeny]], [[Exodus (Ultima)|Exodus]] - an entity that was neither man nor machine.\n\n===Exodus===\n'''Exodus''' is the eponymous villain of ''[[Ultima III: Exodus]]'', the creation of both Mondain and Minax. The first sign of the character's appearance is a missing ship, which returns with the crew completely gone and the word \"EXODUS\" written in blood on the deck of the ship. Exodus then summons creatures to terrorize Sosaria from its castle on the Isle of Fire. Twenty years after Minax's death, the Stranger returns to Sosaria to destroy Exodus.\n\nThe passage through the Isle of Fire is blocked by the trapped Great Earth Serpent. The Stranger yells the correct magic word to set the serpent free; the Great Earth Serpent reappears to assist the Avatar in ''[[Ultima VII Part Two: Serpent Isle]]'', grateful for being freed. Castle Exodus is protected by various magical barriers, requiring the Stranger's party to obtain marks in order to safely pass through. In addition to various creatures that attack the party, the floor itself comes to life and also attacks.\n\nExodus is depicted as having a [[demon]]ic appearance, however the Stranger realizes in the game that Exodus is not a normal living creature. Instead, Exodus is a magical computer that can only be destroyed by inserting the four cards of Love, Sol, Moons, and Death into its four slots. After destroying Exodus, the Isle of Fire sinks into the ocean until ''[[Ultima VII: The Black Gate]]''.\n\nIn the [[Forge of Virtue]] expansion of ''Ultima VII'', the Dark Core of Exodus remains on the island. In order to complete the quests for the add-on, the Avatar must banish the Dark Core into the Ethereal Void.\n\n===Lord Blackthorn===\n'''Lord Blackthorn''' becomes regent of Britannia when Lord British disappears while exploring the Underworld in ''[[Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny|Ultima V]]''. Originally, he is a wise and just ruler, but he is twisted by the Shadowlords and becomes an oppressive [[tyrant]]. By the game's conclusion, Lord British is restored to his throne and Blackthorn sent to [[exile]] through a red moongate to an unknown world. ''[[Ultima VII Part Two: Serpent Isle]]'' explains that his destination is the Serpent Isle. While on Serpent Isle, Blackthorn takes refuge among the Xenkan Monks and finds redemption, eventually joining their order. But ''Ultima IX'' diverges from this restoration of Lord Blackthorn having him leave the island before the Avatar arrives on the Serpent Island. Blackthorn returns again as a villain in ''[[Ultima IX: Ascension]]'', this time as a servant of the Guardian, which again contradicts the restorative end on ''Ultima VII: Part Two: Serpent Isle''. In the end Blackthorn perishes at the hand of [[Lord British]] after an extensive magical duel at the center of the Great Stygian Abyss, completely contradicting everything written prior to Ascension and after ''Ultima VII''.\n\nIn ''[[Ultima Online]]'', the timeline of which diverges from the main series after ''[[Ultima I: The First Age of Darkness|Ultima I]]'', Blackthorn is the closest friend of Lord British, but at the same time he is also his fiercest enemy. He has been defending the peoples' individuality and freedom of belief by creating his own virtue, chaos. In this case, chaos does not represent the destructive force with which it is usually associated. He eventually forged an alliance with various dark magics and emerged as an evil force. After \"surviving\" through a few years, he was seemingly killed in an assault on the city of Yew. The evil form was later retconned into being an facsimile, and the original Lord Blackthorn became the king of Britannia. Lord Blackthorn was the virtual persona of Ultima Online project director [[Starr Long]].\n\n===The Shadowlords===\n\n===The Guardian===\n'''The Guardian''' is an alien being of immense power from another dimension. A large red humanoid, he is described as a conqueror of worlds. He first appears in ''[[Ultima VII: The Black Gate]]'' although for the majority of the game he is only a disembodied voice. Having conquered other worlds, he first attempts to conquer Britannia through his agent Batlin, the founder and leader of the Fellowship. The ultimate plan was to create a black moongate to allow the Guardian to physically enter Britannia and conquer it. The Avatar discovers the Guardian\u2019s plan and destroys the black moongate as the Guardian is attempting to enter.\n\nOne year later, in ''[[Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds]]'', the Guardian attempted to conquer Britannia again by creating a blackrock dome around Castle Britannia and trapping the Avatar and his companions inside. The Guardian planned to send troops through a portal within the castle to conquer Britannia by killing its leaders first. The Avatar defeated the Guardian by destroying the portal and the dome. During the course of the game, the Avatar visited several worlds already conquered or destroyed by the Guardian.\n\nIt was revealed in ''[[Ultima VII Part Two: Serpent Isle]]'' that the Guardian had a backup plan and had sent Batlin to the Serpent Isle to further his plans to conquer Britannia. Batlin attempts to betray the Guardian and is killed for his disloyalty but not before releasing the apocalyptic forces of the Banes of Chaos. The Avatar ends the threat by reuniting the Chaos, Order, and Balance Serpents. At the end of the game, the Avatar is captured by the Guardian.\n\nIn ''[[Ultima VIII: Pagan]]'', the Guardian trapped the Avatar on Pagan, a world completely under the control of the Guardian. The Avatar eventually masters the different elemental magic of this world and returns to Britannia.\n\nIn ''[[Ultima IX: Ascension]]'', it is learned that while the Avatar was trapped on Pagan, the Guardian has managed to erect eight huge columns throughout Britannia, in order to pull the two moons out of orbit, crashing into the planet and destroying it. The Avatar destroys the eight columns and defeats the Guardian. In the final battle, the Guardian reveals that he is the Avatar\u2019s other half, created from the evil part of the Avatar abandoned at the conclusion of ''[[Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar|Ultima IV]]''. The Avatar defeats the Guardian by using the Armageddon spell to fuse the two of them into one new being.\n\nFans and chroniclers of the ''Ultima'' series have speculated that the Guardian was a satirical metaphor for Origin's parent company, [[Electronic Arts]], which had been rumored to be stifling [[Richard Garriott]]'s creative control over the last installments of the series. Supporting this theory is the fact that the three artifacts of the Guardian, first seen in ''[[Ultima VII: The Black Gate]]'', are the sphere, the cube, and the tetrahedron, which together are an unmistakable representation of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120306204357/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/eb/Electronic_Arts_historical_logo.svg/300px-Electronic_Arts_historical_logo.svg.png EA logo] during the early 1990s when EA's acquisition of Origin was complete and the games were developed. Furthermore, two members of the Fellowship in The Black Gate, Elizabeth and Abraham (E&A) provide dubious guidance for the Avatar throughout the game and are ultimately unmasked as evildoers.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Conquest of Origin |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_14/87-The-Conquest-of-Origin |title=The Escapist : |publisher=Escapistmagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-17}}</ref> The Guardian is described as the \"Destroyer of Worlds\", a possible reference to Origin's tagline which read \"We create worlds\".\n\n===Batlin===\n\n==Other significant or recurring characters==\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n\n* Yes : The character is in that game.\n* No : The character is not in that game.\n* AE : An alter-ego of the character is in that game.\n* M/R : The character is only mentioned or referenced in that game.\n* Mnl : The character is only referenced in the game manual.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

He is still known as Lord British even after his departure from ''Ultima'' maker [[Origin Systems]]: Garriott retained the trademark rights to the name Lord British with its associated symbols, and the character appeared in his latest (and now defunct) online game, ''[[Tabula Rasa (video game)|Tabula Rasa]]'' as General British.\n\nLord British is a man who comes from [[Earth]] to [[Sosaria]] through a moongate. He adopts the name Cantabrigian British, taken from his birthplace, [[Cambridge]] in the [[United Kingdom]], in favor of his old name. He quickly meets the evil wizard, Mondain, and does battle with him. After defeating him, British becomes known as \"Champion of the White Light\" and \"Lord British, Protector of Akalabeth.\" Numerous plotlines and side-quests in the ''Ultima'' games revolve around one of Lord British's adventures or public works projects. He had a key role in founding the Museum, Conservatory, and innumerable institutions of the Britannian society. He also continuously provides [[healing]], [[resurrection]] and other miscellaneous help for the Avatar.\n\nOne of the most famous characteristics of Lord British is that he is (supposedly) indestructible. In the past, he has been killed as a result of various glitches and exploits.<ref name=computerandvideogames>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=181917 |title=PC Feature: The Many Deaths of Lord British |publisher=ComputerAndVideoGames.com |date=2008-02-10 |accessdate=2012-02-14}}</ref>  This fact has led to the naming of the \"Lord British Postulate\", a postulate that in any game if a creature is alive, someone somewhere will try to kill it. Most of the games in the series require the use of glitches to kill the character, and Garriott was less than pleased after learning that the character can be lured to be killed by cannon fire in ''[[Ultima III: Exodus]]''.<ref>The Official Book of Ultima page 30 and 31</ref> During ''[[Ultima VII]]'', an easter egg allows British to be killed by a falling gold plaque, which is a reference to an incident at the Origin building; a metal bar, where the magnet on the door attached to it, fell on Garriott's head, warranting a visit to the hospital. One of the characters says, \"Yancey-Hausman will pay!\" which is a reference to the owner and landlord of the building.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dino's Ultima Page - Ultima 7 Guide - Fun - The Bar that killed the King |url=http://gigi.nullneuron.net/ultima/u7bg/u7fun.killlb.php |author=Joe Garrity |date=2003-07-27 |quote= |accessdate=2008-08-25}}</ref> During ''[[Ultima Online]]'''s [[development stage|beta test]], Garriott's character was killed by various bugs and an oversight on Garriott's part.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aschulze.net/ultima/stories9/beta.htm|title=Ultima Online Travelogues: Ultima Online Beta|accessdate=2006-08-17|author=Hawkeye Pike |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060618223856/http://www.aschulze.net/ultima/stories9/beta.htm |archivedate = June 18, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bannister|first=Paul|title=Ultima Online: Interview with Rainz, The Man Who Killed Lord British|url=http://noctalis.com/dis/uo/blast02a.shtml|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> This is considered to be a major event within online gaming, as it gave \"players an unprecedented ability to change and influence the game.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Brad King |url=https://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/news/2002/06/52894 |title=Make Love, Not War Games |publisher=Wired.com |date= 2002-06-08|accessdate=2012-02-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/technology/7561553.stm | work=BBC News | title=Writing the history of virtual worlds | date=2008-08-15 | accessdate=2010-05-11}}</ref> General British of Tabula Rasa was also killed during beta testing.<ref name=computerandvideogames/>\nIn ''Ultima IX: Ascension'', Lord British may be killed by making a poisoned loaf of bread with the rat poison and the bread maker on Earth, and then by replacing his loaf of bread with it.\n\n===Chuckles===\n'''Chuckles''' is Lord British's court jester. He is often found in Castle Britannia. At times, he helps the Avatar, yet he is known to have led the Avatar to a wild goose chase. He is based on Chuck Bueche, one of the founders of Origin Systems.\n\n===The Time Lord===\n'''The Time Lord''' is a powerful being who ensures the smooth and orderly flow of time through space. In ''Ultima III'', he reveals the correct placement of the Four Cards that would destroy Exodus. In ''Ultima VII'', the Avatar must seek him out to learn more about the Fellowship. He helps the Avatar again in ''Ultima IX''.\n\n===The Great Earth Serpent===\n'''The Great Earth Serpent''' is snatched by Exodus and forced to guard the Isle of Fire in ''Ultima III''. The Great Earth Serpent helps the Avatar to restore balance to Serpent Isle in ''Ultima VII Part II''.\n\n===The Gypsy===\nThe Avatar visits '''the Gypsy''' to determine his or her strength in the virtues before taking on each quest of ''Ultima IV'', ''V'', ''VI'' and ''IX''.\n\n===Hawkwind===\nHawkwind is a renowned cartographer in ''Ultima III'' (as mentioned in the game manual). He has become Seer of Souls in ''Ultima IV'' and resides in Castle Britannia. He guides the Stranger in the path to Avatarhood. He appears again in ''Ultima IX'', and more to his background is told.\n\n===Smith===\nA talking horse.\n\n===Wisps===\n\n===Nystul===\n\n===Lord Draxinusom===\n\n===Arcadion===\n\n===Other characters in the series===\n\n* '''The King of the White Dragon''' shares the rulership of the Lands of Danger and Despair (later known as Serpent Isle) with Shamino in ''[[Ultima I]]''. By ''[[Ultima VII Part Two: Serpent Isle]]'', it is revealed that Shamino was in love with the King of the White Dragon's daughter Beatrix back in ''Ultima I''. When Mondain was defeated, the lands of old Sosaria thundered apart. Shamino at the time was at the Lands of Lord British and could not return to his own land ever since. As a result, Beatrix later died of a broken heart. The King of the White Dragon went mad with grief, and tortured and murdered everyone in his castle's grand banquet for the Solstice Festival amid the goblin invasion. At the end, he flung himself from the tower of his castle. When the Avatar tries to enter his castle in ''Ultima VII Part Two'', his mad ghost appears and tries to kill the hero. His ghost is finally put to rest after a hard battle.\n* '''Sir Simon'''\n* '''Lady Tessa'''\n* '''Gwenneth''' is Iolo's apprentice and works in his shop, Iolo's Bows, in Britain. She manages the shop with Gwenno in ''Ultima V'' when Iolo has been made an outlaw by Blackthorn. By ''Ultima VI'', she has taken over the shop since Iolo's retirement.\n* '''Dr. Cat'''\n* '''Sutek'''\n* '''Sin'Vraal'''\n* '''Nicodemus'''\n* '''Rudyom'''\n* '''Penumbra'''\n* '''Horance'''\n* '''Nell'''\n* '''Patterson'''\n* '''Nastassia'''\n* '''Erstam'''\n* '''Beatrix''''s story is told in ''Ultima VII Part Two''. She was the daughter of the King of the White Dragon and the betrothed of Shamino back in the time of ''Ultima I''. Shamino unfortunately got stranded in the Lands of Lord British due to ancient Sosaria sundering apart from the defeat of Mondain at the hand of the Stranger. Beatrix eventually died of a broken heart in Shamino's castle, which causes her father, the King, to go mad and slay everyone in his castle amid the goblin invasion. Beatrix's spirit remained in Shamino's abandoned castle. In ''Ultima VII Part Two'', Shamino accompanied the Avatar to Serpent Isle. He eventually came upon the ruins of his former castle where Beatrix's ghost, full of rage, confronted him over his seeming betrayal and attacked him.\n* '''Samhayne'''\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{notelist|2}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://wiki.ultimacodex.com/wiki/Category:NPCs The Ultima Wiki - containing information of every ''Ultima'' character]\n\n{{Ultima}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Ultima Characters}}\n[[Category:Lists of video game characters|Ultima series characters]]\n[[Category:Ultima characters| ]]\n", "name_user": "Nealbo", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe Guardian:clean up,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ultima_characters"}
