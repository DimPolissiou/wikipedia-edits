He was conceived by the series' creators [[Matt Groening]] and [[David X. Cohen]], and is voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]. He fulfills a comic, [[antihero]]-type role in ''Futurama'' and is described by fellow character [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] as an \"[[Alcoholism|alcoholic]], [[Prostitution|whore]]-mongering, [[Chain smoking|chain-smoking]] gambler\".<ref name=\"COTH\">{{cite episode |title=Crimes of the Hot|episodelink=Crimes of the Hot|series=Futurama |credits=[[Aaron Ehasz|Ehasz, Aaron]]|network=Fox |airdate=November 10, 2002 |season=4 |number=8}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the character's [[backstory]], Bender was purpose built in Tijuana, Mexico (the other characters refer to his \"swarthy [[Latin Americans|Latin]] charm\") a reference to [[Bending (metalworking)]] in Mexican [[maquiladora]]s. Viewers are informed, through his own testimony, of Bender's prejudice against non-[[robot]]s.  For example, one of his signature expressions is \"kill all humans\". Exceptions who are not subject to Bender's prejudicial attitude are those individuals on his \"Do Not Kill\" list, which seems to comprise only his best friend [[Philip J. Fry]] and his colleague [[Hermes Conrad]] (added after the episode \"[[Lethal Inspection]]\").<ref name=LethInsp /> However, Bender is also occasionally portrayed as possessing a sympathetic side, suggesting that he is not as belligerent as he claims, a view often echoed by his friends.<ref name=BSNBATV>{{cite episode |title=Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV|episodelink=Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV|series=Futurama |credits=[[Lewis Morton|Morton, L.]]|network=Fox |airdate=August 3, 2003 |season=04 |number=06}}</ref><ref name=BWBB>{{cite video | people=[[Peter Avanzino|Avanzino, Peter]] (Director) | date=June 24, 2008 | title=[[Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs|The Beast with a Billion Backs]] | medium=DVD | publisher=[[The Curiosity Company]] et al|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n==Character biography==\nBender, a high-tech industrial [[metalworking]] robot, was built in 2996 at F\u00e1brica Rob\u00f3tica De La Madre (Spanish: \"Mom's Robot Factory\"), a manufacturing facility of [[Mom (Futurama)|Mom's]] Friendly Robot Company in [[Tijuana]], Mexico.<ref name=LethInsp>{{cite episode |title=Lethal Inspection|episodelink=Lethal Inspection|series=Futurama |credits=[[Eric Horsted|Horsted, Eric]]|network=Fox |airdate=July 22, 2010 |season=6 |number=6}}</ref> However, the story of his construction remains a mystery. Although different creation processes have been shown, Cohen has stated that the viewer has only been shown Bender emerging from the machine that created him, while what happened inside the machine has not yet been revealed. According to one version, suggested by Hermes' flashback,<ref name=LethInsp /> and also by a reverse aging process shown in the episode \"[[Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles]]\", a newborn Bender possessed a baby-like body. In \"[[Bendless Love]]\", however, Bender is portrayed with a normal, adult-sized body in a flashback sequence conveying his memory of coming into existence. As Bender's memory contains an adult form, the episode's content suggests that the character might actually be recalling a transfer to an adult body, rather than the moment of creation.<ref name=\"Cohen03\">{{cite video| people=Cohen, David X |date=2003|title=Futurama'' Season 4 DVD commentary for episode \"[[Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles]]\"''| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>\n\nUnlike most other robots, Bender is mortal and, according to [[Professor Farnsworth]]'s calculations, may have less than one billion years to live. Because of a manufacturing error that left Bender without a [[backup]] unit, Bender's memory cannot be transferred or uploaded to another robot body. After reporting that defect to his manufacturer, Bender barely escapes death from a guided missile and a robot [[death squad]] dispatched by [[Mom (Futurama)|Mom]] in order to eliminate him and effectively take the defective product off the market.<ref name=LethInsp />\n\nAt the factory, Bender was programmed for cold-bending [[structural steel]]. Bender later attended Bending State University, where he [[college major|majored]] in bending and [[Minor (academic)|minored]] in Robo-American Studies. At the university, he was a member of Epsilon Rho Rho (ERR), a robot [[college fraternity|fraternity]], where he became something of a fraternity hero for his many shenanigans: one night he chugged an entire keg of [[beer]], [[streaking|streaked]] across campus, and [[Phonebooth stuffing|stuffed]] 58 people into a [[telephone booth]] (although he concedes they were mostly children).\n\nBefore meeting [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] and [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] and joining Planet Express (where he currently works as the [[Management|assistant manager]] of sales),<ref name=BBS>{{cite video | people=[[Dwayne Carey-Hill|Carey-Hill, Dwayne]] (Director) | date=November 27, 2007 |location=United States | title=[[Futurama: Bender's Big Score|Bender's Big Score]] | medium=DVD | publisher=[[The Curiosity Company]] et al|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Bender had a job at the metalworking factory, bending steel [[girder]]s for the construction of [[suicide booth]]s.\n\nBender has an apartment in the \"Robot Arms Apts.\" building, where he eventually invites his best friend and coworker, Fry, to live with him. Although the pair enjoy living together, Bender is sometimes portrayed as manipulating his guileless friend. In the series' early episodes, Bender is shown preferring to occupy smaller areas of their apartment, like the closet, referring to them as \"cozy\", although in later episodes he is shown to have his own individual bedroom, like Fry.\n\nThroughout the series, he enters many romantic relationships of varying duration, and is commonly referred to as a [[Promiscuity#Male promiscuity|womanizer]] by his friends. He does not seem to discriminate between human women and their robot or \"fem-bot\" counterparts, and is shown actively pursuing both. Likewise, his taste in fem-bot partners does not seem to be affected by the fem-bot's height or weight, and he is shown numerous times chasing fem-bots of all builds. In \"[[Proposition Infinity]]\", Bender's secret affair with coworker [[Amy Wong]] leads to a [[referendum]] that, once approved, legalizes [[Robot fetishism|robosexuality]]. In \"[[The Bots and the Bees]]\", he has a sexual encounter with a fem-bot soda vending machine that leads to the almost-instantaneous birth of a son, whom he names Ben, after the first part of his own name.\n\n[[Professor Farnsworth]] describes Bender to be constructed of an alloy of iron and [[osmium]]. Bender hates magnets, as magnets interfere with his inhibition unit, causing him to uncontrollably start singing [[folk music|folk songs]] when near his head; and also causing him to reveal his secret ambition to be a folk singer. He is once able to attach a magnetic small faux-beard underneath his mouth without breaking into song. Bender also has a near-pathological fear of electric can openers.\n\n==Character==\n\n===Creation===\nBender's visual design went through multiple changes before reaching its final state. One of the decisions which Groening found to be particularly difficult was whether Bender's head should be square or round. Initially he worked under the idea that all robots would have square heads in the year 3000; however, it was later decided that Bender's head should be round, a visual play on the idea that Bender is a \"round peg in a square hole\".<ref>{{cite news|first=James |last= Sterngold|title=Bringing an Alien And a Robot to Life; The Gestation of the Simpsons' Heirs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/22/arts/bringing-an-alien-and-a-robot-to-life-the-gestation-of-the-simpsons-heirs.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher= The New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=July 22, 1999 |accessdate=July 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Voice===\n[[File:John DiMaggio 2008.jpg|thumb|250px|right|John DiMaggio at the 2008 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]].]]\nWhen casting for ''Futurama'', Bender's voice was the most difficult to cast, in part because the show's creators had not yet decided what robots should sound like.<ref name=\"Cohen01\">{{cite video| people=Cohen, David X |date=2003|title=Futurama season 1 DVD commentary for the episode \"Space Pilot 3000\"| medium=DVD|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|location=Los Angeles, California}}</ref> Because of this, every voice actor who auditioned, no matter for what role, was also asked to read for Bender.

(168&nbsp;cm); 6&nbsp;ft. (183&nbsp;cm) including his [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]. In \"[[The Farnsworth Parabox]]\", Bender states that he flipped a coin to decide his color, ending up with foghat gray rather than gold. In \"[[The Cyber House Rules]]\", Bender shows the kids a black-and-white [[mug shot]] of himself taken after his arrest for theft. In \"[[Time Keeps on Slippin']]\", Bender is shown trying to join a basketball team and makes himself taller by simply extending his legs. His body has a \"shiny metal ass\", two legs, two \"Extens-o-matic\" arms with three fingers each, a head with two replaceable eyes shaped like [[light-emitting diode]]s, and a mouth used for fuel intake and voice communication. In \"[[Bender Gets Made]]\", Bender claims he also has a nose, but he chooses not to wear it. Bender's human-like characteristics are reinforced by his display of behaviors often regarded as exclusive to humans, such as whistling, snoring, having [[bloodshot eyes]], [[crying]], feeling [[physical attraction]], being [[tickling|tickled]], [[dream]]ing, and [[belching]].\n\nOther bending units of the same model as Bender, such as [[Flexo (Futurama)|Flexo]], share the same hardware design, but differ in terms of their personality and behavior. For example, Flexo shows personality traits similar to those of Bender but is not quite as \"evil\" as Bender. In the episode \"[[Mother's Day (Futurama)|Mother's Day]]\", Leela looks through a simulation of a bending unit's sight, which targets potential [[wikt:rube|rubes]] and then denotes a plan to rob them and leave them in a ditch, implying that all bending robots are somewhat prone to theft and amoral by design. However, another unit, Billy West (named after the series voice actor of the same name), is helpful and kind, though he lives as a farmer on the Moon and insists on not being a bending unit.<ref name=\"TSC\">{{cite episode |title=The Silence of the Clamps| episodelink=The Silence of the Clamps| series= Futurama |credits=Rogers, Eric|network=Fox |airdate=July 14, 2011|season=6 |number=14}}</ref>\n\nBender's [[serial number]], 2716057, can be expressed as the sum of two cubes, which is humorous to Bender and Flexo after Flexo reveals that his serial number has the same characteristic (also, Bender\u2019s designation 1729 is a [[taxicab number]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bbrp.atwebpages.com/mathematics.html|title=Maths in ''Futurama''|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614030601/http://bbrp.atwebpages.com/mathematics.html |archive-date=June 14, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Functions===\nBender was designed specifically for the relatively simple task of bending straight metal girders into various angles. Despite this apparent simplicity, he possesses numerous features superfluous to his original purpose, which become more apparent after an electric jolt to his antenna from an overhead light socket in the pilot episode. The scope of Bender's functionality is impressive; he often acts as if he were a multifunctional [[gadget]] rather than a special bending machine. Similar to a contemporary computer, he hosts a number of input/output devices: his head has a data socket and remotely operated volume control.<ref name=\"APTR\">{{cite episode |title=A Pharaoh to Remember|episodelink=A Pharaoh to Remember|series=Futurama |credits=[[Ron Weiner|Weiner, Ron]]|network=Fox |airdate=March 10, 2002 |season=4 |number=17}}</ref> His body has a socket for a microphone jack, a dual-socket [[Electric receptacle|power receptacle]],<ref name=BSNBATV /> a [[reset button]],<ref>Bender pushes a button on his body to erase everything he knows about cooking before his first cooking lesson in \"[[The 30% Iron Chef]]\".</ref> a [[kill switch]],<ref name=BWBB /> and a self-destruct button. Having the hardware-based self-destruct control on his body, rather than in his software, prevents Bender from committing suicide in \"[[A Head in the Polls]]\" when he pawns everything but his head, grows desperate without it and desires to kill himself.\n\nBender is capable of disassembling and reassembling his body at will and operating each detached body part individually and remotely, presumably by using his transmitter and antenna to send wireless signals. His head can be used for a wide range of functions, whether attached to his body or not. In one episode, Leela reassembles Bender into a functioning [[go-kart]] (albeit in an event shown in the \"What-If\" machine).\n\nBender uses his chest cavity as a [[Locker (cabinet)|locker]], which seems to [[magic satchel|store much more than is physically possible]]; it is often used to store heads in jars, small children, [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[money]], loot, the world's last [[darkroom]], and, on a few occasions, Fry. In \"[[The Route of All Evil]]\", the cavity was also used as a boil kettle, [[Brewing#Hopback|hopback]] and [[fermentation (food)|fermentation tank]] to produce home-made beer. Upon inspection of his body, it appears to be empty, though devices like the F-Ray reveal that, despite appearing hollow, Bender's body contains gears and other robotic components.\n\nBeing an electronic machine, he can perform quick mathematical calculations, but admits to being a poor calculator.\n\n===Build===\nAs a bending unit, Bender possesses extraordinary strength, which he often demonstrates by lifting heavy objects, smashing through walls, and even bending an enormous steel girder marked \"UNBENDABLE\" (in \"[[Bendless Love]]\"). His mechanical nature also makes him far more durable than the rest of the cast, capable of surviving gunfire, explosions, extreme heat, deep water, or [[vacuum|hard vacuum]].\n\nEven when his body is seemingly destroyed or completely detached from his head, it has no effect on Bender's ability to think and communicate, indicating that his main processing facilities are located in his head.<ref>Indirect evidence suggesting that the Bender's [[computer]] is in fact located in his head is provided in several episodes. In \"[[Fry and the Slurm Factory]]\" the F-ray exam shows that Bender's head contains a device clearly marked \"6502\" (a designation for [[MOS Technology 6502]], an eight-bit microprocessor used in the [[Apple I|original Apple Computer]]). In \"[[Roswell that Ends Well]]\", Fry's grandfather reaches deep inside Bender's head and retrieves a handful of [[circuit board]]s and [[Integrated circuit|microchip]]s, to which Bender protests by exclaiming, \"Hey, that's my brain!\".</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Truth About Bender's Brain|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/processors/the-truth-about-benders-brain|work=IEEE Spectrum|publisher=IEEE|accessdate=29 July 2012|first= David X. | last= Cohen|date=May 2009}}</ref> Bender's hardware is controlled by a factory-loaded [[operating system]], which reboots upon incidental shutdown and automatically adjusts its settings to the environment detected at the time of rebooting. For example, in \"[[The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz]]\", when Bender reboots, his visual sensors detect a colony of penguins, prompting his  [[booting|boot loader]] to re-initialize him with penguin-like behavior and language.\n\nHe is equipped with a vast capacity of [[computer data storage]], in excess of 100,001 [[terabyte]]s- 1 TB for general storage and 100,000 TB for the storage of pornography, though in \"[[Overclockwise]]\" Cubert Farnsworth deletes 12 TB of outdated catchphrases from Bender. Presumably either Bender has a separate \"catchphrase drive\" or the majority of the catchphrases are also pornographic.<ref>In Season 7, Episode 17 \"Forty Percent Leadbelly\", it is shown that Bender has a 1 [[terabyte]] \"Main Drive\", and a 100,000 [[terabyte]] \"Porn Drive\".</ref>\n\n===Source of energy===\nBender is powered by [[alcohol]]-based fuels, which he can convert into an electrical power source sufficient to operate not only himself, but also small household appliances plugged into his [[power receptacle]].<ref>In the episode \"[[Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV]]\", Bender serves as a power supply for a small television set, which is plugged into a receptacle located on the underside of Bender's body.</ref> Low alcohol intake levels decrease his production of electricity: when he stops drinking and begins to \"sober\", his behavior grows increasingly ebrious and dysfunctional, and he grows a red beard of [[rust]].<ref name=\"IR\">{{cite episode |title=I, Roommate|episodelink=I, Roommate| series= Futurama |credits=[[Eric Horsted|Horsted, E]]|network=Fox |airdate=1999-04-06 |season=1 |number=3}}</ref> He is also, apparently, able to sustain himself by consuming mineral oil, though he considers this to be only 'functional'.\n\nDue to [[Professor Farnsworth]]'s flawed design, the energy conversion process inside Bender's body produces an inordinate amount of waste gases and heat. He can expel these products from his rear end<ref name=\"COTH\" /> or, more often, as a flaming [[belch]].\n\nHe also has a [[nuclear pile]] inside his body, as seen in \"[[Godfellas]]\". However, its location and purpose are not clear.\n\n==Personality==\nBender often exhibits [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]] behavior; he is a [[pathological liar]] and rarely shows any [[empathy]] (his most frequent catchphrase to any bothersome person is \"Bite my shiny metal ass!\"). He has a mostly voluntary morality and [[Kleptomania|constantly steals]], ranging from the petty theft of wallets to  crimes such as [[kidnapping]] [[Jay Leno]]'s head and stealing Fry's blood and kidney. He also once stole Amy's earrings while giving her a hug. It was shown in \"[[Roswell That Ends Well]]\" that even in a disassembled state, his individual limbs carry on attempting to steal anything in proximity; the hand on his dismembered arm steals a wallet out of a scientist's pocket before becoming inactive again.\n\nHe is shown throughout the series as having a secret desire to be a [[folk musician]] that only manifests itself when a magnet is placed on or near his head. This desire is finally fulfilled in the episode \"[[Bendin' in the Wind]]\": an accident involving a giant [[can opener]] leaves him with a mutilated chest and paralyzed from the neck down. An encounter with [[Beck]] during his hospitalization leads to his becoming lead washboard player and the two teaming up for a musical tour that turns Bender into a [[folk hero]] for other broken robots, only for his career to end when he finally recovers.\n\nHe is also fascinated with cooking, being the chef of the ''Planet Express Ship'', though he is shown to have no sense of actual [[taste]]. In fact, his early dinners were so horrible that even the omnivorous Zoidberg could not eat it. In his first attempt, he creates a dinner for the crew that is so over-salted they all gag (which is aggravated further when their drinks turn out to be [[saline water|\"salt with water in them\"]]); he then remarks that the food was fine since the salt content was 10% below a lethal dose. In \"[[The Problem with Popplers]]\", he creates dinner consisting of nothing but [[caper]]s and [[Sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]], and mistakenly expresses his belief that humans eat rocks. He seems to improve his cooking skills over the series, cooking a lavish cake for [[Nibbler (Futurama)|Nibbler]]'s birthday party and beating [[Elzar]] for the title of [[Iron Chef|Iron Cook]] (though he uses a potion called \"The Essence of Pure Flavor\", which consists of water and a generous portion of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] to make the judges hallucinate that his food tastes good). In ''[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]'', he mistakenly bakes prison guards a cake with [[nutmeg]] thinking it was a natural human [[sleep drug]], before being corrected by Amy that nutmeg is in fact a baking ingredient.\n\nAs a robot, he possesses an incredible amount of patience. In \"Roswell That Ends Well\", he is shown to wait over a thousand years in sand after his head is lost during a trip back in time to 1947, as well as many thousands of years in caverns under New New York City (although on this occasion he was also in the presence of multiple alternate versions of himself that had previously made the same 'trip'). Despite the long wait, it is implied that Bender does not power down, apparently enjoying his own company so much that he does not consider it necessary. However, in one episode, he shows next to no patience as a one-time joke.\n\nAlthough the consumption of alcohol is necessitated by Bender's design and should not be generally viewed as a vice for alcohol-fueled robots, he apparently drinks far more than he needs for energy. His excessive drinking contributes to his characterization as an alcoholic (\"Hell Is Other Robots\" reveals that robots can function equally well on mineral oil instead of alcohol, also contributing to the perception of Bender's alcohol use as a vice). If he is deprived of alcohol, for instance during periods of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], he ceases to function properly and shows signs similar to human [[drunkenness]], including developing a rusty [[five o'clock shadow]]. As noted above, his disembodied head has survived for millennia with, presumably, no source of alcohol, so it may be that, when a mere head, Bender neither requires alcohol nor suffers from its absence.\n\nWhen he is sufficiently frightened or sickened, [[brick]]s fall from his backside (a reference to the slang \"shitting bricks\").<ref name=BWBB /> When sufficiently fascinated by something, he may pull out a camera and snap a picture, adding the [[catchphrase]] \"Neat!\". He has also been shown to be able to use his eyes as cameras. In addition to drinking, he also has an affinity for cigars, which he ignites with a [[lighter]] built into his finger, although in \"[[Decision 3012]]\" he uses a [[Zippo]]. Unlike drinking alcohol for fuel, Bender tells Fry that he smokes cigars simply because they \"make [him] look cool\".\n\nDespite being a robot, he has been seen to show emotion on many occasions, going so far as to shed a tear in \"[[Crimes of the Hot]]\", to Fry's astonishment. One of the series' [[running joke]]s revolves around Bender having emotions, when technically he should be an unfeeling machine. Bender is seemingly unaware of his emotions, stating in the episode \"Anthology of Interest II\" \"I mean, being a robot's great but we don't have emotions and sometimes that makes me very sad\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Futurama Episode 403 \"Anthology of Interest II\"|url=http://www.imsdb.com/transcripts/Futurama-Anthology-Of-Interest-II.html|work=The Internet Movie Script Database| publisher= IMSDb|accessdate=29 July 2012|author=Lewis Morton |author2=David X. Cohen |author3=Jason Gorbett |author4=Scott Kirby}}</ref> In his very first appearance, he tries to commit suicide via a suicide booth out of guilt for having unknowingly contributed to their creation. He has also been known to be nonchalant to the point of appearing both uncaring and incredibly brave, even in life-threatening situations.\n\nBender is a classic [[narcissist]]. He considers himself flawless, a \"towering inferno of physical perfection\",<ref name=LethInsp /> and refers to himself in both the first and third person. In \"[[The Farnsworth Parabox]]\" Bender seemingly falls in love with an alternate [[gold plating|gold-plated]] version of himself, stating that he has finally found someone \"as great as me\". Even his personal email address, <nowiki>bender@ilovebender.com</nowiki>,<ref name=BBS /> reflects his self-absorbed nature.\n\nDespite these human characteristics, he has no verifiable [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], as seen in \"[[Obsoletely Fabulous]]\" when he passes through a \"soul detector\" without setting off the alarm. However, in \"[[Ghost in the Machines]]\", Bender becomes a ghost who can't interact with people directly but can possess machinery: he uses this ability to \"scare Fry to death\". He eventually  makes a deal with the Robot Devil to get a new body.\n\nHis relationships with the rest of the crew of Planet Express vary over time, although he treats nearly all biological organisms with disdain. The only one of his friends who he has openly shown affection for is Fry, his best friend and roommate. \"Of all the friends I've had, [he is] the first.\" Although he is verbally and physically abusive towards Fry and considers him to be vastly inferior to him, he has been shown to care for him a great deal. In \"[[Jurassic Bark]]\" he states that he loves Fry \"the way a human loves a dog\", and in \"[[I Second That Emotion (Futurama episode)|I Second That Emotion]]\" when Bender gets jealous of Nibbler and flushes him down the toilet, a distraught Leela asks how he would feel if she did the same to Fry, describing Fry as Bender's pet (Bender responds with an apathetic \"Only one way to find out.\"). He routinely takes advantage of his friends, including framing them for crimes, robbing them, stealing Fry's [[blood]] on more than one occasion, stealing Fry's [[power of attorney]], using Fry's body to smash open a window, taking Fry's kidney and trying to sell it (it eventually gets eaten by Leela), and stealing jewelry from Amy. He is prone to using Zoidberg in various get-rich-quick schemes, although it is probable he does not consider Dr. Zoidberg a friend, since in \"[[Obsoletely Fabulous]]\" Bender begged the 1X Robot to \"save (his) friends, and Zoidberg\" (Though it is seen that he helps Zoidberg from time to time, as seen in \"[[That's Lobstertainment!]]\"). He even betrays Leela to [[Zapp Brannigan]] in ''Into the Wild Green Yonder'' when she becomes a wanted criminal, out of jealousy of her steadily growing [[rap sheet]], only to break her out of prison again to ensure his own sheet remains lengthier. Although he regularly frustrates the crew, they have demonstrated a certain affection for him in return. During \"[[How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back]]\", the entire crew traveled to the Central Bureaucracy to recover his brain after Morgan Proctor burned it onto a floppy disk and sent it away. [[Hermes Conrad]] subsequently risks his bureaucratic license to locate the disc with Bender's brain on it by sorting the entire pile in just under four minutes. In the same episode, when Amy asked why they had to fix him, after being met with a brief period of uncertain silence, Leela responded with \"Those arguments aside, we're still going.\" Amy and Bender date for a time in \"[[Proposition Infinity]]\"; the relationship becomes so serious that Bender proposes to Amy and participates in a campaign to legalize human/robot marriage, although the relationship ends after he realizes that such marriage rights would necessitate monogamy.\n\nDespite his often immoral attitude, he does not lack a soft side; he can feel guilt and remorse over his actions if he goes too far (even by his own standards), indicating that he is not as selfish or unkind as he appears to be. In \"Bendless Love\", Bender intends to murder Flexo in order to gain the love of fem-bot Angelyne, but when Flexo gets stuck under a gigantic steel girder, Angelyne shows sorrow for him. Bender decides that her happiness is more important than his own, and ends up saving Flexo. Also, in \"Jurassic Bark\", when Bender becomes jealous of Fry's petrified dog, Seymour, he decides to throw him in magma. But when he realizes how Fry becomes deeply hurt, Bender apologizes for his behavior and rescues the dog. In \"Godfellas\", he becomes the god of a microscopic alien race and abuses this position by commanding them to produce beer for him. When his abuse of power causes the entire species' demise, however, he cries in mourning and remorse.\n\n==Reception and cultural influence==\nIn 2008, Bender took second place behind [[Terminator (character)|the Terminator]] in a poll for the \"Baddest Movie Robot\" on [[Techradar.com]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/baddest-movie-robot-the-votes-are-in--389842| title=Baddest movie robot: the votes are in!| author= TechRadar staff| publisher= [[Techradar.com]]| date=June 10, 2008| accessdate=June 10, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe song \"Bend It Like Bender!\" from the [[Devin Townsend|Devin Townsend Project]] album ''[[Addicted (The Devin Townsend Project album)|Addicted]]'', is a direct reference to Bender and contains the quote \"Game's over, losers!  I have all the money!\"\n\n===Appearances in other media===\nBeing the show's [[breakout character]], Bender has made several cameos in different episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', another series by [[Matt Groening]]. Within ''The Simpsons'', Bender has appeared in episodes \"[[Future-Drama]]\", \"[[Bart vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade]]\", \"[[Missionary: Impossible]]\" and \"[[Replaceable You]]\". Bender also makes a cameo appearance in Matt Groening's latest series ''[[Disenchantment (TV series)|Disenchantment]]'', in the episode \"[[Disenchantment (TV series)|Dreamland Falls]]\".\n\nIn the ''Simpsons''-''Futurama'' crossover episode \"[[Simpsorama]]\", Bender travels back in time in the 21st century to Springfield to kill [[Homer Simpson]], whose DNA is tied to the creatures rampaging in the 31st century. Bender ends up befriending Homer before learning that the creatures are in fact [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]'s genetic offspring. Once the crisis is averted, Bender goes into shutdown mode in the Simpsons' basement. Bender was still resting inert in the Simpsons' basement as of 2015 episode \"[[Cue Detective]]\" in which his empty body cavity was used to store the family's cash nest-egg. Bender also makes a background cameo appearance in the ''Simpsons'' episode \"[[My Fare Lady]]\", holding a shovel and bucket at the end of Homer's dream about ''[[The Jetsons]]''.\n\nBender, along with [[Professor Farnsworth]] and [[Fry (Futurama)|Fry]], appear in the season finale of ''Disenchantment'' as a hologram from a crystal ball, within the one-way time machine from the ''Futurama'' episode \"[[The Late Philip J. Fry]]\".\n\nHe also appears as one of the enemies, along with [[Doctor Zoidberg]], in ''[[The Simpsons Game]]''.\n\nBender makes cameo appearances in several ''[[Family Guy]]'' episodes. In \"[[Blue Harvest]]\" he can be seen at the [[Mos Eisley]] cantina, and in \"[[The Splendid Source]]\", he is one of the repeaters of a dirty joke whose original author [[Peter Griffin]], [[Joe Swanson]], and [[Glenn Quagmire]] are seeking. In the episode \"[[Boopa-dee Bappa-dee]]\", Peter attempts to use the guide on the television remote, turning [[Stewie Griffin]] into a host of past and present Animation Domination characters, including Bender. In \"Throw it Away\", [[Lois Griffin]] drags Stewies Time Machine down the stairs which takes them to, in order, the 1950s, the 18th century, the future, with [[Chris Griffin]] replaced by Bender.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Futurama}}\n{{The Simpsons}}\n\n[[Category:Futurama characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Fictional couriers]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Tijuana]]\n[[Category:Fictional professional thieves]]\n[[Category:Fictional gamblers]]\n[[Category:Fictional Mexican people]]\n[[Category:Fictional con artists]]\n[[Category:Fictional alcohol abusers]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who have made pacts with devils]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1999]]\n[[Category:Fictional smokers]]\n[[Category:Fictional war veterans]]\n[[Category:Fictional attempted suicides]]\n[[Category:Fictional humanoid robots]]\n[[Category:Male characters in animation]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Futurama character}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Bender (''Futurama'')}}\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Bender\n| series             = [[Futurama]] / [[The Simpsons]]\n| image              = Bender Rodriguez.png\n| gender             = Male\n| species            = [[Bending (metalworking)|Bending]] [[Industrial Robot]]\n| alias              = B.B.

He was conceived by the series' creators [[Matt Groening]] and [[David X. Cohen]], and is voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]. He fulfills a comic, [[antihero]]-type role in ''Futurama'' and is described by fellow character [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] as an \"[[Alcoholism|alcoholic]], [[Prostitution|whore]]-mongering, [[Chain smoking|chain-smoking]] gambler\".<ref name=\"COTH\">{{cite episode |title=Crimes of the Hot|episodelink=Crimes of the Hot|series=Futurama |credits=[[Aaron Ehasz|Ehasz, Aaron]]|network=Fox |airdate=November 10, 2002 |season=4 |number=8}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the character's [[backstory]], Bender was purpose built in Tijuana, Mexico (the other characters refer to his \"swarthy [[Latin Americans|Latin]] charm\") a reference to [[Bending (metalworking)]] in Mexican [[maquiladora]]s. Viewers are informed, through his own testimony, of Bender's prejudice against non-[[robot]]s.  For example, one of his signature expressions is \"kill all humans\". Exceptions who are not subject to Bender's prejudicial attitude are those individuals on his \"Do Not Kill\" list, which seems to comprise only his best friend [[Philip J. Fry]] and his colleague [[Hermes Conrad]] (added after the episode \"[[Lethal Inspection]]\").<ref name=LethInsp /> However, Bender is also occasionally portrayed as possessing a sympathetic side, suggesting that he is not as belligerent as he claims, a view often echoed by his friends.<ref name=BSNBATV>{{cite episode |title=Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV|episodelink=Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV|series=Futurama |credits=[[Lewis Morton|Morton, L.]]|network=Fox |airdate=August 3, 2003 |season=04 |number=06}}</ref><ref name=BWBB>{{cite video | people=[[Peter Avanzino|Avanzino, Peter]] (Director) | date=June 24, 2008 | title=[[Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs|The Beast with a Billion Backs]] | medium=DVD | publisher=[[The Curiosity Company]] et al|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n==Character biography==\nBender, a high-tech industrial [[metalworking]] robot, was built in 2996 at F\u00e1brica Rob\u00f3tica De La Madre (Spanish: \"Mom's Robot Factory\"), a manufacturing facility of [[Mom (Futurama)|Mom's]] Friendly Robot Company in [[Tijuana]], Mexico.<ref name=LethInsp>{{cite episode |title=Lethal Inspection|episodelink=Lethal Inspection|series=Futurama |credits=[[Eric Horsted|Horsted, Eric]]|network=Fox |airdate=July 22, 2010 |season=6 |number=6}}</ref> However, the story of his construction remains a mystery. Although different creation processes have been shown, Cohen has stated that the viewer has only been shown Bender emerging from the machine that created him, while what happened inside the machine has not yet been revealed. According to one version, suggested by Hermes' flashback,<ref name=LethInsp /> and also by a reverse aging process shown in the episode \"[[Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles]]\", a newborn Bender possessed a baby-like body. In \"[[Bendless Love]]\", however, Bender is portrayed with a normal, adult-sized body in a flashback sequence conveying his memory of coming into existence. As Bender's memory contains an adult form, the episode's content suggests that the character might actually be recalling a transfer to an adult body, rather than the moment of creation.<ref name=\"Cohen03\">{{cite video| people=Cohen, David X |date=2003|title=Futurama'' Season 4 DVD commentary for episode \"[[Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles]]\"''| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>\n\nUnlike most other robots, Bender is mortal and, according to [[Professor Farnsworth]]'s calculations, may have less than one billion years to live. Because of a manufacturing error that left Bender without a [[backup]] unit, Bender's memory cannot be transferred or uploaded to another robot body. After reporting that defect to his manufacturer, Bender barely escapes death from a guided missile and a robot [[death squad]] dispatched by [[Mom (Futurama)|Mom]] in order to eliminate him and effectively take the defective product off the market.<ref name=LethInsp />\n\nAt the factory, Bender was programmed for cold-bending [[structural steel]]. Bender later attended Bending State University, where he [[college major|majored]] in bending and [[Minor (academic)|minored]] in Robo-American Studies. At the university, he was a member of Epsilon Rho Rho (ERR), a robot [[college fraternity|fraternity]], where he became something of a fraternity hero for his many shenanigans: one night he chugged an entire keg of [[beer]], [[streaking|streaked]] across campus, and [[Phonebooth stuffing|stuffed]] 58 people into a [[telephone booth]] (although he concedes they were mostly children).\n\nBefore meeting [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] and [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] and joining Planet Express (where he currently works as the [[Management|assistant manager]] of sales),<ref name=BBS>{{cite video | people=[[Dwayne Carey-Hill|Carey-Hill, Dwayne]] (Director) | date=November 27, 2007 |location=United States | title=[[Futurama: Bender's Big Score|Bender's Big Score]] | medium=DVD | publisher=[[The Curiosity Company]] et al|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Bender had a job at the metalworking factory, bending steel [[girder]]s for the construction of [[suicide booth]]s.\n\nBender has an apartment in the \"Robot Arms Apts.\" building, where he eventually invites his best friend and coworker, Fry, to live with him. Although the pair enjoy living together, Bender is sometimes portrayed as manipulating his guileless friend. In the series' early episodes, Bender is shown preferring to occupy smaller areas of their apartment, like the closet, referring to them as \"cozy\", although in later episodes he is shown to have his own individual bedroom, like Fry.\n\nThroughout the series, he enters many romantic relationships of varying duration, and is commonly referred to as a [[Promiscuity#Male promiscuity|womanizer]] by his friends. He does not seem to discriminate between human women and their robot or \"fem-bot\" counterparts, and is shown actively pursuing both. Likewise, his taste in fem-bot partners does not seem to be affected by the fem-bot's height or weight, and he is shown numerous times chasing fem-bots of all builds. In \"[[Proposition Infinity]]\", Bender's secret affair with coworker [[Amy Wong]] leads to a [[referendum]] that, once approved, legalizes [[Robot fetishism|robosexuality]]. In \"[[The Bots and the Bees]]\", he has a sexual encounter with a fem-bot soda vending machine that leads to the almost-instantaneous birth of a son, whom he names Ben, after the first part of his own name.\n\n[[Professor Farnsworth]] describes Bender to be constructed of an alloy of iron and [[osmium]]. Bender hates magnets, as magnets interfere with his inhibition unit, causing him to uncontrollably start singing [[folk music|folk songs]] when near his head; and also causing him to reveal his secret ambition to be a folk singer. He is once able to attach a magnetic small faux-beard underneath his mouth without breaking into song. Bender also has a near-pathological fear of electric can openers.\n\n==Character==\n\n===Creation===\nBender's visual design went through multiple changes before reaching its final state. One of the decisions which Groening found to be particularly difficult was whether Bender's head should be square or round. Initially he worked under the idea that all robots would have square heads in the year 3000; however, it was later decided that Bender's head should be round, a visual play on the idea that Bender is a \"round peg in a square hole\".<ref>{{cite news|first=James |last= Sterngold|title=Bringing an Alien And a Robot to Life; The Gestation of the Simpsons' Heirs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/22/arts/bringing-an-alien-and-a-robot-to-life-the-gestation-of-the-simpsons-heirs.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher= The New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=July 22, 1999 |accessdate=July 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Voice===\n[[File:John DiMaggio 2008.jpg|thumb|250px|right|John DiMaggio at the 2008 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]].]]\nWhen casting for ''Futurama'', Bender's voice was the most difficult to cast, in part because the show's creators had not yet decided what robots should sound like.<ref name=\"Cohen01\">{{cite video| people=Cohen, David X |date=2003|title=Futurama season 1 DVD commentary for the episode \"Space Pilot 3000\"| medium=DVD|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|location=Los Angeles, California}}</ref> Because of this, every voice actor who auditioned, no matter for what role, was also asked to read for Bender.

(168&nbsp;cm); 6&nbsp;ft. (183&nbsp;cm) including his [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]. In \"[[The Farnsworth Parabox]]\", Bender states that he flipped a coin to decide his color, ending up with foghat gray rather than gold. In \"[[The Cyber House Rules]]\", Bender shows the kids a black-and-white [[mug shot]] of himself taken after his arrest for theft. In \"[[Time Keeps on Slippin']]\", Bender is shown trying to join a basketball team and makes himself taller by simply extending his legs. His body has a \"shiny metal ass\", two legs, two \"Extens-o-matic\" arms with three fingers each, a head with two replaceable eyes shaped like [[light-emitting diode]]s, and a mouth used for fuel intake and voice communication. In \"[[Bender Gets Made]]\", Bender claims he also has a nose, but he chooses not to wear it. Bender's human-like characteristics are reinforced by his display of behaviors often regarded as exclusive to humans, such as whistling, snoring, having [[bloodshot eyes]], [[crying]], feeling [[physical attraction]], being [[tickling|tickled]], [[dream]]ing, and [[belching]].\n\nOther bending units of the same model as Bender, such as [[Flexo (Futurama)|Flexo]], share the same hardware design, but differ in terms of their personality and behavior. For example, Flexo shows personality traits similar to those of Bender but is not quite as \"evil\" as Bender. In the episode \"[[Mother's Day (Futurama)|Mother's Day]]\", Leela looks through a simulation of a bending unit's sight, which targets potential [[wikt:rube|rubes]] and then denotes a plan to rob them and leave them in a ditch, implying that all bending robots are somewhat prone to theft and amoral by design. However, another unit, Billy West (named after the series voice actor of the same name), is helpful and kind, though he lives as a farmer on the Moon and insists on not being a bending unit.<ref name=\"TSC\">{{cite episode |title=The Silence of the Clamps| episodelink=The Silence of the Clamps| series= Futurama |credits=Rogers, Eric|network=Fox |airdate=July 14, 2011|season=6 |number=14}}</ref>\n\nBender's [[serial number]], 2716057, can be expressed as the sum of two cubes, which is humorous to Bender and Flexo after Flexo reveals that his serial number has the same characteristic (also, Bender\u2019s designation 1729 is a [[taxicab number]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bbrp.atwebpages.com/mathematics.html|title=Maths in ''Futurama''|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614030601/http://bbrp.atwebpages.com/mathematics.html |archive-date=June 14, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Functions===\nBender was designed specifically for the relatively simple task of bending straight metal girders into various angles. Despite this apparent simplicity, he possesses numerous features superfluous to his original purpose, which become more apparent after an electric jolt to his antenna from an overhead light socket in the pilot episode. The scope of Bender's functionality is impressive; he often acts as if he were a multifunctional [[gadget]] rather than a special bending machine. Similar to a contemporary computer, he hosts a number of input/output devices: his head has a data socket and remotely operated volume control.<ref name=\"APTR\">{{cite episode |title=A Pharaoh to Remember|episodelink=A Pharaoh to Remember|series=Futurama |credits=[[Ron Weiner|Weiner, Ron]]|network=Fox |airdate=March 10, 2002 |season=4 |number=17}}</ref> His body has a socket for a microphone jack, a dual-socket [[Electric receptacle|power receptacle]],<ref name=BSNBATV /> a [[reset button]],<ref>Bender pushes a button on his body to erase everything he knows about cooking before his first cooking lesson in \"[[The 30% Iron Chef]]\".</ref> a [[kill switch]],<ref name=BWBB /> and a self-destruct button. Having the hardware-based self-destruct control on his body, rather than in his software, prevents Bender from committing suicide in \"[[A Head in the Polls]]\" when he pawns everything but his head, grows desperate without it and desires to kill himself.\n\nBender is capable of disassembling and reassembling his body at will and operating each detached body part individually and remotely, presumably by using his transmitter and antenna to send wireless signals. His head can be used for a wide range of functions, whether attached to his body or not. In one episode, Leela reassembles Bender into a functioning [[go-kart]] (albeit in an event shown in the \"What-If\" machine).\n\nBender uses his chest cavity as a [[Locker (cabinet)|locker]], which seems to [[magic satchel|store much more than is physically possible]]; it is often used to store heads in jars, small children, [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[money]], loot, the world's last [[darkroom]], and, on a few occasions, Fry. In \"[[The Route of All Evil]]\", the cavity was also used as a boil kettle, [[Brewing#Hopback|hopback]] and [[fermentation (food)|fermentation tank]] to produce home-made beer. Upon inspection of his body, it appears to be empty, though devices like the F-Ray reveal that, despite appearing hollow, Bender's body contains gears and other robotic components.\n\nBeing an electronic machine, he can perform quick mathematical calculations, but admits to being a poor calculator.\n\n===Build===\nAs a bending unit, Bender possesses extraordinary strength, which he often demonstrates by lifting heavy objects, smashing through walls, and even bending an enormous steel girder marked \"UNBENDABLE\" (in \"[[Bendless Love]]\"). His mechanical nature also makes him far more durable than the rest of the cast, capable of surviving gunfire, explosions, extreme heat, deep water, or [[vacuum|hard vacuum]].\n\nEven when his body is seemingly destroyed or completely detached from his head, it has no effect on Bender's ability to think and communicate, indicating that his main processing facilities are located in his head.<ref>Indirect evidence suggesting that the Bender's [[computer]] is in fact located in his head is provided in several episodes. In \"[[Fry and the Slurm Factory]]\" the F-ray exam shows that Bender's head contains a device clearly marked \"6502\" (a designation for [[MOS Technology 6502]], an eight-bit microprocessor used in the [[Apple I|original Apple Computer]]). In \"[[Roswell that Ends Well]]\", Fry's grandfather reaches deep inside Bender's head and retrieves a handful of [[circuit board]]s and [[Integrated circuit|microchip]]s, to which Bender protests by exclaiming, \"Hey, that's my brain!\".</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Truth About Bender's Brain|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/processors/the-truth-about-benders-brain|work=IEEE Spectrum|publisher=IEEE|accessdate=29 July 2012|first= David X. | last= Cohen|date=May 2009}}</ref> Bender's hardware is controlled by a factory-loaded [[operating system]], which reboots upon incidental shutdown and automatically adjusts its settings to the environment detected at the time of rebooting. For example, in \"[[The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz]]\", when Bender reboots, his visual sensors detect a colony of penguins, prompting his  [[booting|boot loader]] to re-initialize him with penguin-like behavior and language.\n\nHe is equipped with a vast capacity of [[computer data storage]], in excess of 100,001 [[terabyte]]s- 1 TB for general storage and 100,000 TB for the storage of pornography, though in \"[[Overclockwise]]\" Cubert Farnsworth deletes 12 TB of outdated catchphrases from Bender. Presumably either Bender has a separate \"catchphrase drive\" or the majority of the catchphrases are also pornographic.<ref>In Season 7, Episode 17 \"Forty Percent Leadbelly\", it is shown that Bender has a 1 [[terabyte]] \"Main Drive\", and a 100,000 [[terabyte]] \"Porn Drive\".</ref>\n\n===Source of energy===\nBender is powered by [[alcohol]]-based fuels, which he can convert into an electrical power source sufficient to operate not only himself, but also small household appliances plugged into his [[power receptacle]].<ref>In the episode \"[[Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV]]\", Bender serves as a power supply for a small television set, which is plugged into a receptacle located on the underside of Bender's body.</ref> Low alcohol intake levels decrease his production of electricity: when he stops drinking and begins to \"sober\", his behavior grows increasingly ebrious and dysfunctional, and he grows a red beard of [[rust]].<ref name=\"IR\">{{cite episode |title=I, Roommate|episodelink=I, Roommate| series= Futurama |credits=[[Eric Horsted|Horsted, E]]|network=Fox |airdate=1999-04-06 |season=1 |number=3}}</ref> He is also, apparently, able to sustain himself by consuming mineral oil, though he considers this to be only 'functional'.\n\nDue to [[Professor Farnsworth]]'s flawed design, the energy conversion process inside Bender's body produces an inordinate amount of waste gases and heat. He can expel these products from his rear end<ref name=\"COTH\" /> or, more often, as a flaming [[belch]].\n\nHe also has a [[nuclear pile]] inside his body, as seen in \"[[Godfellas]]\". However, its location and purpose are not clear.\n\n==Personality==\nBender often exhibits [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]] behavior; he is a [[pathological liar]] and rarely shows any [[empathy]] (his most frequent catchphrase to any bothersome person is \"Bite my shiny metal ass!\"). He has a mostly voluntary morality and [[Kleptomania|constantly steals]], ranging from the petty theft of wallets to  crimes such as [[kidnapping]] [[Jay Leno]]'s head and stealing Fry's blood and kidney. He also once stole Amy's earrings while giving her a hug. It was shown in \"[[Roswell That Ends Well]]\" that even in a disassembled state, his individual limbs carry on attempting to steal anything in proximity; the hand on his dismembered arm steals a wallet out of a scientist's pocket before becoming inactive again.\n\nHe is shown throughout the series as having a secret desire to be a [[folk musician]] that only manifests itself when a magnet is placed on or near his head. This desire is finally fulfilled in the episode \"[[Bendin' in the Wind]]\": an accident involving a giant [[can opener]] leaves him with a mutilated chest and paralyzed from the neck down. An encounter with [[Beck]] during his hospitalization leads to his becoming lead washboard player and the two teaming up for a musical tour that turns Bender into a [[folk hero]] for other broken robots, only for his career to end when he finally recovers.\n\nHe is also fascinated with cooking, being the chef of the ''Planet Express Ship'', though he is shown to have no sense of actual [[taste]]. In fact, his early dinners were so horrible that even the omnivorous Zoidberg could not eat it. In his first attempt, he creates a dinner for the crew that is so over-salted they all gag (which is aggravated further when their drinks turn out to be [[saline water|\"salt with water in them\"]]); he then remarks that the food was fine since the salt content was 10% below a lethal dose. In \"[[The Problem with Popplers]]\", he creates dinner consisting of nothing but [[caper]]s and [[Sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]], and mistakenly expresses his belief that humans eat rocks. He seems to improve his cooking skills over the series, cooking a lavish cake for [[Nibbler (Futurama)|Nibbler]]'s birthday party and beating [[Elzar]] for the title of [[Iron Chef|Iron Cook]] (though he uses a potion called \"The Essence of Pure Flavor\", which consists of water and a generous portion of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] to make the judges hallucinate that his food tastes good). In ''[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]'', he mistakenly bakes prison guards a cake with [[nutmeg]] thinking it was a natural human [[sleep drug]], before being corrected by Amy that nutmeg is in fact a baking ingredient.\n\nAs a robot, he possesses an incredible amount of patience. In \"Roswell That Ends Well\", he is shown to wait over a thousand years in sand after his head is lost during a trip back in time to 1947, as well as many thousands of years in caverns under New New York City (although on this occasion he was also in the presence of multiple alternate versions of himself that had previously made the same 'trip'). Despite the long wait, it is implied that Bender does not power down, apparently enjoying his own company so much that he does not consider it necessary. However, in one episode, he shows next to no patience as a one-time joke.\n\nAlthough the consumption of alcohol is necessitated by Bender's design and should not be generally viewed as a vice for alcohol-fueled robots, he apparently drinks far more than he needs for energy. His excessive drinking contributes to his characterization as an alcoholic (\"Hell Is Other Robots\" reveals that robots can function equally well on mineral oil instead of alcohol, also contributing to the perception of Bender's alcohol use as a vice). If he is deprived of alcohol, for instance during periods of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], he ceases to function properly and shows signs similar to human [[drunkenness]], including developing a rusty [[five o'clock shadow]]. As noted above, his disembodied head has survived for millennia with, presumably, no source of alcohol, so it may be that, when a mere head, Bender neither requires alcohol nor suffers from its absence.\n\nWhen he is sufficiently frightened or sickened, [[brick]]s fall from his backside (a reference to the slang \"shitting bricks\").<ref name=BWBB /> When sufficiently fascinated by something, he may pull out a camera and snap a picture, adding the [[catchphrase]] \"Neat!\". He has also been shown to be able to use his eyes as cameras. In addition to drinking, he also has an affinity for cigars, which he ignites with a [[lighter]] built into his finger, although in \"[[Decision 3012]]\" he uses a [[Zippo]]. Unlike drinking alcohol for fuel, Bender tells Fry that he smokes cigars simply because they \"make [him] look cool\".\n\nDespite being a robot, he has been seen to show emotion on many occasions, going so far as to shed a tear in \"[[Crimes of the Hot]]\", to Fry's astonishment. One of the series' [[running joke]]s revolves around Bender having emotions, when technically he should be an unfeeling machine. Bender is seemingly unaware of his emotions, stating in the episode \"Anthology of Interest II\" \"I mean, being a robot's great but we don't have emotions and sometimes that makes me very sad\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Futurama Episode 403 \"Anthology of Interest II\"|url=http://www.imsdb.com/transcripts/Futurama-Anthology-Of-Interest-II.html|work=The Internet Movie Script Database| publisher= IMSDb|accessdate=29 July 2012|author=Lewis Morton |author2=David X. Cohen |author3=Jason Gorbett |author4=Scott Kirby}}</ref> In his very first appearance, he tries to commit suicide via a suicide booth out of guilt for having unknowingly contributed to their creation. He has also been known to be nonchalant to the point of appearing both uncaring and incredibly brave, even in life-threatening situations.\n\nBender is a classic [[narcissist]]. He considers himself flawless, a \"towering inferno of physical perfection\",<ref name=LethInsp /> and refers to himself in both the first and third person. In \"[[The Farnsworth Parabox]]\" Bender seemingly falls in love with an alternate [[gold plating|gold-plated]] version of himself, stating that he has finally found someone \"as great as me\". Even his personal email address, <nowiki>bender@ilovebender.com</nowiki>,<ref name=BBS /> reflects his self-absorbed nature.\n\nDespite these human characteristics, he has no verifiable [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], as seen in \"[[Obsoletely Fabulous]]\" when he passes through a \"soul detector\" without setting off the alarm. However, in \"[[Ghost in the Machines]]\", Bender becomes a ghost who can't interact with people directly but can possess machinery: he uses this ability to \"scare Fry to death\". He eventually  makes a deal with the Robot Devil to get a new body.\n\nHis relationships with the rest of the crew of Planet Express vary over time, although he treats nearly all biological organisms with disdain. The only one of his friends who he has openly shown affection for is Fry, his best friend and roommate. \"Of all the friends I've had, [he is] the first.\" Although he is verbally and physically abusive towards Fry and considers him to be vastly inferior to him, he has been shown to care for him a great deal. In \"[[Jurassic Bark]]\" he states that he loves Fry \"the way a human loves a dog\", and in \"[[I Second That Emotion (Futurama episode)|I Second That Emotion]]\" when Bender gets jealous of Nibbler and flushes him down the toilet, a distraught Leela asks how he would feel if she did the same to Fry, describing Fry as Bender's pet (Bender responds with an apathetic \"Only one way to find out.\"). He routinely takes advantage of his friends, including framing them for crimes, robbing them, stealing Fry's [[blood]] on more than one occasion, stealing Fry's [[power of attorney]], using Fry's body to smash open a window, taking Fry's kidney and trying to sell it (it eventually gets eaten by Leela), and stealing jewelry from Amy. He is prone to using Zoidberg in various get-rich-quick schemes, although it is probable he does not consider Dr. Zoidberg a friend, since in \"[[Obsoletely Fabulous]]\" Bender begged the 1X Robot to \"save (his) friends, and Zoidberg\" (Though it is seen that he helps Zoidberg from time to time, as seen in \"[[That's Lobstertainment!]]\"). He even betrays Leela to [[Zapp Brannigan]] in ''Into the Wild Green Yonder'' when she becomes a wanted criminal, out of jealousy of her steadily growing [[rap sheet]], only to break her out of prison again to ensure his own sheet remains lengthier. Although he regularly frustrates the crew, they have demonstrated a certain affection for him in return. During \"[[How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back]]\", the entire crew traveled to the Central Bureaucracy to recover his brain after Morgan Proctor burned it onto a floppy disk and sent it away. [[Hermes Conrad]] subsequently risks his bureaucratic license to locate the disc with Bender's brain on it by sorting the entire pile in just under four minutes. In the same episode, when Amy asked why they had to fix him, after being met with a brief period of uncertain silence, Leela responded with \"Those arguments aside, we're still going.\" Amy and Bender date for a time in \"[[Proposition Infinity]]\"; the relationship becomes so serious that Bender proposes to Amy and participates in a campaign to legalize human/robot marriage, although the relationship ends after he realizes that such marriage rights would necessitate monogamy.\n\nDespite his often immoral attitude, he does not lack a soft side; he can feel guilt and remorse over his actions if he goes too far (even by his own standards), indicating that he is not as selfish or unkind as he appears to be. In \"Bendless Love\", Bender intends to murder Flexo in order to gain the love of fem-bot Angelyne, but when Flexo gets stuck under a gigantic steel girder, Angelyne shows sorrow for him. Bender decides that her happiness is more important than his own, and ends up saving Flexo. Also, in \"Jurassic Bark\", when Bender becomes jealous of Fry's petrified dog, Seymour, he decides to throw him in magma. But when he realizes how Fry becomes deeply hurt, Bender apologizes for his behavior and rescues the dog. In \"Godfellas\", he becomes the god of a microscopic alien race and abuses this position by commanding them to produce beer for him. When his abuse of power causes the entire species' demise, however, he cries in mourning and remorse.\n\n==Reception and cultural influence==\nIn 2008, Bender took second place behind [[Terminator (character)|the Terminator]] in a poll for the \"Baddest Movie Robot\" on [[Techradar.com]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/baddest-movie-robot-the-votes-are-in--389842| title=Baddest movie robot: the votes are in!| author= TechRadar staff| publisher= [[Techradar.com]]| date=June 10, 2008| accessdate=June 10, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe song \"Bend It Like Bender!\" from the [[Devin Townsend|Devin Townsend Project]] album ''[[Addicted (The Devin Townsend Project album)|Addicted]]'', is a direct reference to Bender and contains the quote \"Game's over, losers!  I have all the money!\"\n\n===Appearances in other media===\nBeing the show's [[breakout character]], Bender has made several cameos in different episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', another series by [[Matt Groening]]. Within ''The Simpsons'', Bender has appeared in episodes \"[[Future-Drama]]\", \"[[Bart vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade]]\", \"[[Missionary: Impossible]]\" and \"[[Replaceable You]]\". Bender also makes a cameo appearance in Matt Groening's latest series ''[[Disenchantment (TV series)|Disenchantment]]'', in the episode \"[[Disenchantment (TV series)|Dreamland Falls]]\".\n\nIn the ''Simpsons''-''Futurama'' crossover episode \"[[Simpsorama]]\", Bender travels back in time in the 21st century to Springfield to kill [[Homer Simpson]], whose DNA is tied to the creatures rampaging in the 31st century. Bender ends up befriending Homer before learning that the creatures are in fact [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]'s genetic offspring. Once the crisis is averted, Bender goes into shutdown mode in the Simpsons' basement. Bender was still resting inert in the Simpsons' basement as of 2015 episode \"[[Cue Detective]]\" in which his empty body cavity was used to store the family's cash nest-egg. Bender also makes a background cameo appearance in the ''Simpsons'' episode \"[[My Fare Lady]]\", holding a shovel and bucket at the end of Homer's dream about ''[[The Jetsons]]''.\n\nBender, along with [[Professor Farnsworth]] and [[Fry (Futurama)|Fry]], appear in the season finale of ''Disenchantment'' as a hologram from a crystal ball, within the one-way time machine from the ''Futurama'' episode \"[[The Late Philip J. Fry]]\".\n\nHe also appears as one of the enemies, along with [[Doctor Zoidberg]], in ''[[The Simpsons Game]]''.\n\nBender makes cameo appearances in several ''[[Family Guy]]'' episodes. In \"[[Blue Harvest]]\" he can be seen at the [[Mos Eisley]] cantina, and in \"[[The Splendid Source]]\", he is one of the repeaters of a dirty joke whose original author [[Peter Griffin]], [[Joe Swanson]], and [[Glenn Quagmire]] are seeking. In the episode \"[[Boopa-dee Bappa-dee]]\", Peter attempts to use the guide on the television remote, turning [[Stewie Griffin]] into a host of past and present Animation Domination characters, including Bender. In \"Throw it Away\", [[Lois Griffin]] drags Stewies Time Machine down the stairs which takes them to, in order, the 1950s, the 18th century, the future, with [[Chris Griffin]] replaced by Bender.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Futurama}}\n{{The Simpsons}}\n\n[[Category:Futurama characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Fictional couriers]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Tijuana]]\n[[Category:Fictional professional thieves]]\n[[Category:Fictional gamblers]]\n[[Category:Fictional Mexican people]]\n[[Category:Fictional con artists]]\n[[Category:Fictional alcohol abusers]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who have made pacts with devils]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1999]]\n[[Category:Fictional smokers]]\n[[Category:Fictional war veterans]]\n[[Category:Fictional attempted suicides]]\n[[Category:Fictional humanoid robots]]\n[[Category:Male characters in animation]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "ThalesCRG", "label": "safe", "comment": "standardize fiance and fiancee to fiancee", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bender_(Futurama)"}

{"title_page": "New Order (Indonesia)", "text_new": "{{About|the Indonesian government of the 1960s through 1990s|other uses of the term|New Order (disambiguation)}}\n{{EngvarB|date=September 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2015}}\n{{History of Indonesia}}\n\nThe '''New Order''' ({{lang-id|Orde Baru}} or ''Orba'') is the term coined by the second Indonesian President [[Suharto]] to characterise his regime as he came to power in [[Transition to the New Order|1966]]. Suharto used this term to contrast his rule with that of his predecessor, [[Sukarno]] (dubbed the \"Old Order,\" or ''Orde Lama''). The term \"New Order\" in more recent times has become synonymous with the Suharto years (1966\u20131998).\n\nImmediately following the [[30 September Movement|attempted coup]] in 1965, the political situation was uncertain, but the Suharto's New Order found much popular support from groups wanting a separation from Indonesia's problems since its independence. The 'generation of 66' (''[[Angkatan 66]]'') epitomised talk of a new group of young leaders and new intellectual thought. Following Indonesia's communal and political conflicts, and its economic collapse and social breakdown of the late 1950s through to the mid-1960s,  the \"New Order\" was committed to achieving and maintaining political order, economic development, and the removal of mass participation in the political process. The features of the \"New Order\" established from the late 1960s were thus a strong political role for the military, the bureaucratisation and corporatisation of political and societal organisations, and selective but effective repression of opponents. Strident [[anti-communism]] remained a hallmark of the regime for its subsequent 32 years.\n\nWithin a few years, however, many of its original allies had become indifferent or averse to the New Order, which comprised a military faction supported by a narrow civilian group. Among much of the pro-democracy movement which forced Suharto to resign in the [[1998 Indonesian Revolution]] and then gained power, the term \"New Order\" has come to be used pejoratively. It is frequently employed to describe figures who were either tied to the Suharto period, or who upheld the practises of his authoritarian regime, such as corruption, [[collusion]] and [[nepotism]] (widely known by the acronym KKN: ''korupsi'', ''kolusi'', ''nepotisme'').<ref>[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2001/08/24/stop-talk-kkn.html Stop talk of KKN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026103742/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2001/08/24/stop-talk-kkn.html |date=26 October 2014 }}. The Jakarta Post (24 August 2001).</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Liberal democracy period in Indonesia|Guided Democracy in Indonesia}}\n[[Sukarno]] was Indonesia's founding president, a position he had held since the Republic's formation in 1945. In 1955, the first general parliamentary elections delivered an unstable parliament and from the late 1950s, Sukarno's rule became increasingly [[Autocracy|autocratic]] under his \"[[Guided Democracy]]\". Described as the great \u2018\u2019Dalang\u2019\u2019, or puppet master, Sukarno\u2019s position depended on his concept of [[NASAKOM]] (Nationalism, Religion, Communism) whereby he sought to balance the competing Indonesian Military, Islamic groups, and the increasingly powerful [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI). To the resentment of the Military and Muslim groups, this arrangement became increasingly reliant on the PKI which had become the country\u2019s strongest political party.\n\nSukarno\u2019s [[Antiimperialism|anti-imperial]] ideology saw Indonesia increasingly dependent on the [[Soviet Union]] and [[People's Republic of China|China]] which was met with indignation from [[Western world|Western]] countries. The cash-strapped government had to scrap public sector subsidies, annual [[inflation]] rose to as high as 1,000%, export revenues were shrinking, infrastructure crumbling, and factories were operating at minimal capacity with negligible investment. Sukarno\u2019s administration became increasingly ineffective in providing a viable economic system to lift its citizens out of poverty and hunger. Meanwhile, Sukarno led Indonesia into ''[[Konfrontasi]]'', a military confrontation with Malaysia, removed Indonesia from the [[United Nations]], and stepped up revolutionary and anti-Western rhetoric.<ref>Schwarz (1994), pages 52\u201357, {{cite news\n | last = Sheriden\n | first = Greg\n | title = Farewell to Jakarta's Man of Steel\n | publisher = The Australian\n | date = 28 January 2008\n | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23118079-5013460,00.html\n | accessdate = 30 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nBy 1965 at the height of the [[Cold War]], the PKI penetrated all levels of government.

He instituted a Pancasila indoctrination program that must be attended by all Indonesians, from primary school students to office workers.<ref name=\"epress.anu.edu.au\"/> Pancasila, a rather vague and generalist set of principles originally formulated by Sukarno in 1945, was vigorously promoted as a sacrosanct national ideology which represents the ancient wisdom of Indonesian people even before the entry of foreign-based religions such as [[Hinduism]] or [[Islam]]. In a July 1982 speech which reflected his deep infatuation with [[Javanese beliefs]], Suharto glorified Pancasila as a key to reach the perfect life (''ilmu kasampurnaning hurip'') of harmony with God and fellow mankind.<ref name=\"epress.anu.edu.au\"/> In practice, however, the vagueness of Pancasila was exploited by Suharto's government to justify their actions and to condemn their opponents as \"anti-Pancasila\".<ref name=\"epress.anu.edu.au\"/>\n\nThe ''[[Dwifungsi]]'' (\"Dual Function\") policy allowed the military to have an active role in all levels of Indonesian government, economy, and society.\n\n===Neutralisation of internal dissent===\nHaving been appointed president, Suharto still needed to share power with various elements including Indonesian generals who considered Suharto as mere ''[[primus inter pares]]'' as well as Islamic and student groups who participated in the anti-communist purge. Suharto, aided by his \"Office of Personal Assistants\" (''[[Aspri]]'') clique of military officers from his days as commander of Diponegoro Division, particularly [[Ali Murtopo]], began to systematically cement his hold on power by subtly sidelining potential rivals while rewarding loyalists with political position and monetary incentives.\n\nHaving successfully stood-down MPRS chairman General [[Abdul Haris Nasution|Nasution]]'s 1968 attempt to introduce a bill which would have severely curtailed presidential authority, Suharto had him removed from his position as MPRS chairman in 1969 and forced his early retirement from the military in 1972. In 1967, generals HR Dharsono, [[Kemal Idris]], and [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]] (dubbed \"New Order Radicals\") opposed Suharto's decision to allow the participation of existing political parties in elections in favour of a non-ideological [[two-party system]] somewhat similar to those found in many [[Western world|Western]] countries. Suharto then proceeded to send Dharsono overseas as ambassador, while [[Kemal Idris]] and [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]] were sent to distant [[North Sumatra]] and [[South Sulawesi]] as regional commanders.<ref>Wanandi, 2012, p. 56-59</ref>\n\nWhile many original leaders of the 1966 student movement (''[[Angkatan 66]]'') were successfully co-opted into the regime, it faced large student demonstrations challenging the legitimacy of the 1971 elections, the ''Golput'' Movement, the costly construction of [[Taman Mini Indonesia Indah]] theme park (1972), the domination of foreign capitalists ([[Malari Incident]] of 1974), and the lack of [[term limit]]s of Suharto's presidency (1978). The New Order responded by imprisoning student activists and sending army units to occupy the campus of the [[Bandung Institute of Technology]] in 1978. In April 1978, Suharto ended the campus unrest by issuing a decree on the \"Normalization of Campus Life\" (NKK) which prohibited political activities on-campus not related to academic pursuits.<ref>Wanandi, 2012, p. 60-68</ref><ref>Aspinal (1999), p.ii</ref>\n\nIn 1980, fifty prominent figures political figures signed the [[Petition of Fifty]] which criticised Suharto's use of [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] to silence his critics. Suharto refused to address the petitioners' concerns, and some of them were imprisoned with others having restrictions imposed on their movements.<ref>Wanandi, 2012, p. 86-88</ref>\n\n===Domestic politics and security===\n\n====Depoliticization====\nTo placate demands from civilian politicians for the holding of elections, as manifested in MPRS resolutions of 1966 and 1967, Suharto government formulated a series of laws regarding elections as well as the structure and duties of parliament which were passed by MPRS in November 1969 after protracted negotiations. The law provided for a [[People's Consultative Assembly|parliament (''Madjelis Permusjawaratan Rakjat''/MPR)]] with the power to elect presidents consisting of a lower house ([[People's Representative Council|''Dewan Perwakilan Rakjat''/DPR]]) and regional representatives. 100 of the 460 members of DPR were directly appointed by the government, while the remaining seats were allocated to political parties based on results of a general election. This mechanism ensures significant government control over legislative affairs, particularly the appointment of presidents.<ref>Ricklefs (1982), p.76-77</ref><ref>Elson (2001), p.184-186</ref>\n\nTo participate in the elections, Suharto realised the need to align himself with a political party. After initially considering alignment with Sukarno's old party, the [[Indonesian National Party|PNI]], in 1969 Suharto took control of an obscure military-run federation of [[Non-governmental organisation|NGOs]] called [[Golkar]] (\"Functional Group\") and transform it into his electoral vehicle under the co-ordination of his right-hand man [[Ali Murtopo]]. The [[1971 Indonesian legislative election|first general election]] was held on 3 July 1971 with ten participants: [[Golkar]], four Islamic parties, as well as five nationalist and Christian parties. Campaigning on a non-ideological platform of \"development\", and aided by official government support and subtle intimidation tactics. Golkar secured 62.8% of the popular vote. The March 1973 general session of the MPR promptly appointed Suharto to a second term in office with Sultan [[Hamengkubuwono IX]] as vice-president.<ref>Schwarz (1992), p. 32</ref>\n\nOn 5 January 1973, to allow better control, the government forced the four Islamic parties to merge into the [[United Development Party|PPP]] (''Partai Persatuan Pembangunan''/United Development Party) while the five non-Islamic parties were fused into [[Indonesian Democratic Party|PDI]] (''Partai Demokrasi Indonesia''/Indonesian Democratic Party). The government ensured that these parties never developed effective opposition by controlling their leadership, while establishing the \"re-call\" system to remove any outspoken legislators from their positions. Using this system dubbed the \"[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] Democracy\", Golkar won the MPR general elections of [[1977 Indonesian legislative election|1977]], [[1982 Indonesian legislative election|1982]], [[1987 Indonesian legislative election|1987]], [[1992 Indonesian legislative election|1992]], and [[1997 Indonesian legislative election|1997]] with massive landslides. The elected MPR then proceeded to unanimously re-elect Suharto as president in 1978, 1983, 1988, 1993, and 1998.<ref>Schwarz (1992), p.32</ref>\n\n====Establishment of corporative groups====\n\nSuharto proceeded with social engineering projects designed to transform Indonesian society into a de-politicized \"floating mass\" supportive of the national mission of \"development\", a concept similar to [[corporatism]]. The government formed civil society groups to unite the populace in support of government programs. For instance, the government created and required all civil servants to join KORPRI ({{lang-id|Korps Pegawai Republik Indonesia}}, Employees' Corps of the Republic of Indonesia) in November 1971 to ensure their loyalty;<ref group=note>KORPRI still exists today and all civil servants are still required to join the corps.</ref>  organised the FBSI (''Federasi Buruh Seluruh Indonesia'') as the only legal labour union in February 1973 (later renamed as [[Confederation of All Indonesian Workers' Union|SPSI/''Serikat Pekerja Seluruh Indonesia'']] in 1985), established under the pretext of [[tripartism]], officially defined as Pancasilaist Industrial Relations ({{lang-id|Hubungan Industrial Pancasila}}) (while in fact it cements only business interests with the state); and established the [[Indonesian Ulema Council|MUI]] (''Majelis Ulama Indonesia'') in 1975 to control Islamic clerics. In 1966 to 1967, to promote assimiiation of the influential [[Chinese Indonesians]], the Suharto government passed [[Legislation on Chinese Indonesians|several laws]] as part of the so-called \"Basic Policy for the Solution of Chinese Problem\", whereby only one Chinese-language publication (controlled by the army) was allowed to continue, all Chinese cultural and religious expressions (including display of Chinese characters) were prohibited from public space, Chinese schools were phased out, and the ethnic Chinese were encouraged to take [[Indonesian-sounding names adopted by Chinese Indonesians|Indonesian-sounding names]]. In 1968, Suharto commenced the very successful [[family planning]] program (''Keluarga Berentjana''/KB) to stem the huge population growth rate and hence increase per-capita income. A lasting legacy from this period is the [[Enhanced Indonesian Spelling System|spelling reform]] of Indonesian language decreed by Suharto on 17 August 1972.<ref>Schwartz (1994), page 106</ref>\n\n====\"State Ibuism\"====\nInspired by [[Kejaw\u00e8n|Javanese culture]] of [[priyayi]], the New Order, during its consolidation era, is [[antifeminist]] and [[patriarchy|patriarchic]], which principle is officially called \"familyism\" ({{lang-id|kekeluargaan}}). In 1974, President Suharto established civil servant wives' corps ''Dharma Wanita'', organized under the doctrine of \"Five Women's ''[[Dharma]]''\" ({{lang-id|Pancadharma Wanita}}, an [[antifeminist]], [[patriarchy|patriarchic]] doctrine similar to Nazi Germany's [[Kinder, K\u00fcche, Kirche]]); a \"Family Training and Welfare\" programme ({{lang-id|[[w:id:Pembinaan Kesejahteraan Keluarga|Pembinaan dan Kesejahteraan Keluarga]]}}, '''PKK'''), which was rooted on a 1957 conference on [[home economics]] in [[Bogor]], was made compulsory in 1972, especially on rural regions.\n\nIt wasn't until 1980 that feminism would gain an uprising with the establishment of several foundations, for example the Annisa Shanti foundation (Yasanti).\n\n====Political stability====\n\nSuharto relied on the military to ruthlessly maintain domestic security, organised by the [[Kopkamtib]] (Operation Command for the Restoration of Security and Order) and BAKIN (State Intelligence Coordination Agency). To maintain strict control over the country, Suharto expanded the army's territorial system down to the village level, while military officers were appointed as regional heads under the rubric of the ''[[Dwifungsi]]'' (\"Dual Function\") of the military. By 1969, 70% of Indonesia's provincial governors and more than half of its district chiefs were active military officers. Suharto authorised ''Operasi Trisula'' which destroyed PKI remnants trying to organise a guerrilla base in the [[Blitar]] area in 1968 and ordered several military operations which ended the communist PGRS-Paraku insurgency in [[West Kalimantan]] (1967\u20131972). Attacks on oil workers by the first incarnation of [[Free Aceh Movement]] separatists under [[Hasan di Tiro]] in 1977 led to dispatch of small special forces detachments who quickly either killed or forced the movement's members to flee abroad.<ref>Conboy (2003), p. 262-265</ref> Notably, in March 1981, Suharto authorised a successful special forces mission to end [[Garuda Indonesia Flight 206|hijacking of a Garuda Indonesia flight]] by Islamic extremists at [[Don Muang Airport]] in [[Bangkok]].<ref>Elson (2001), p. 177-178</ref>\n\nTo comply with the [[New York Agreement]] of 1962 which required a plebiscite on integration of [[West Irian]] into Indonesia before end of 1969, the Suharto government began organising for a so-called \"[[Act of Free Choice]]\" scheduled on July\u2013August 1969. The government sent RPKAD special forces under [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]] which secured the surrender of several bands of the former Dutch-organized militia ([[Papuan Volunteer Corps|''Papoea Vrijwilligers Korps''/ PVK]]) at large in the jungles since the Indonesian takeover in 1963, while sending Catholic volunteers under [[Jusuf Wanandi]] to distribute consumer goods to promote pro-Indonesian sentiments. In March 1969, it was agreed that the plebiscite will be channelled via 1,025 tribal chiefs, citing the logistical challenge and political ignorance of the population. Using the above strategy, the plebiscite produced a unanimous decision for integration with Indonesia, which was duly noted by [[United Nations General Assembly]] in November 1969.<ref>Elson (2001), p. 178-279</ref>\n\n===Economy===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F032437-0030, Berchtesgaden, Staatsbesuch Pr\u00e4sident Suharto.jpg|thumb|Suharto on a visit to [[West Germany]] in 1970.]]\n\nThe new president enlisted a group of mostly American-educated Indonesian [[Economics|economists]], dubbed the \"[[Berkeley Mafia]]\", to formulate government economic policy. By cutting subsidies and government debt, and reforming the exchange rate mechanism, inflation dropped from 660% in 1966 to 19% in 1969. The threat of [[famine]] was alleviated by influx of [[USAID]] rice aid shipments in 1967 to 1968.<ref>J. Panglaykim and K.D. Thomas, \"The New Order and the Economy,\" Indonesia, April 1967, p. 73.</ref>\n\nRealizing the dearth of domestic capital capable of re-juvenating growth, Suharto reversed Sukarno's economic [[autarky]] policies by opening selected economic sectors of the country to foreign investment under the new Foreign Investment Law of January 1967 (containing generous tax holidays and free movement of money). Suharto himself travelled to Western Europe and [[Japan]] in a series of trips to promote investment into Indonesia, starting in the natural resources sector. Among the first foreign investors to re-enter Indonesia were mining companies [[Freeport-McMoran|Freeport Sulphur Company]] and [[Vale Limited|International Nickel Company]], later followed by significant investment from Japanese, South Korean, and Taiwanese companies. From 1967, the government managed to secure low-interest foreign aid from ten countries grouped under the '''Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia''' (IGGI) to cover its budget deficit.<ref>Elson (2001), p. 170-172</ref>\n\nSuharto's government issued the Domestic Investment Law of June 1968 to allow development of a domestic [[Capitalism|capitalist]] class capable of motoring economic growth to supplement existing state-owned enterprises. The late 1960s and early 1970s saw emergence of domestic entrepreneurs (mostly [[Indonesian Chinese|Chinese-Indonesians]]) in the import-substitution light-manufacturing sector such as [[Astra Group]] and [[Salim Group]].<ref name=\"Robinson 2012, p. 178-203\">Robinson (2012), p. 178-203</ref>\n\nFlush with IGGI foreign aid and later the jump in oil exports during the [[1973 oil crisis]], the government began a series of large-scale intensive investment in infrastructure under a series of five-year plans (''Rencana Pembangunan Lima Tahun / REPELITA''):\n \n* REPELITA I (1969\u20131974) focusing on agricultural improvements ([[Green Revolution]]) to ensure food security\n* REPELITA II (1974\u20131979) focusing on infrastructure on islands outside Java and growth in primary industries\n* REPELITA III (1979\u20131984) focusing on achieving food self-sufficiency and growth in export-oriented labour-intensive industry\n* REPELITA IV (1984\u20131989) focusing on growth in capital-good manufacturing\n* REPELITA V (1989\u20131994) focusing on growth in telecommunications, education, and transportation infrastructure\n* REPELITA VI (1994\u20131998, unfinished) focusing on infrastructure to support foreign investment and free trade<ref name=\"Robinson 2012, p. 178-203\"/><ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\">\n{{cite news\n| last = McDonald\n| first = Hamish\n| author-link = Hamish McDonald\n| title = No End to Ambition\n| newspaper = Sydney Morning Herald\n| date = 28 January 2008\n| url = https://www.smh.com.au/news/world/no-end-to-ambition/2008/01/27/1201368944638.html\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Sheridan-theaustralian\">\n{{cite news\n| last = Sheridan\n| first = Greg\n| title = Farewell to Jakarta's Man of Steel\n|work=The Australian\n| date = 28 January 2008\n| url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/farewell-to-jakartas-man-of-steel/story-e6frg6v6-1111115412423\n| accessdate =14 April 2010\n}}</ref>\n\nWhile establishing a formal economy based on rational and sound macroeconomic policies, Suharto continued his past ''[[modus operandi]]'' of creating a vast network of charitable organisations (\"''yayasan''\") run by the military and his family members, which extracted \"donations\" from domestic and foreign enterprises in exchange for necessary government support and permits. While some proceeds of these organisations were used for genuinely charitable purposes (such as building a heart-disease hospital by ''Yayasan Harapan Kita'' run by the first lady), most of the money was recycled as [[slush fund]]s to reward political allies to maintain support for Suharto's regime.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" />\n<ref name=\"KKN\">\n{{cite news\n| last = Koerner\n| first = Brendan\n| url = http://www.slate.com/id/2097858\n| title = How Did Suharto Steal $35 Billion?

The company's director, General [[Ibnu Sutowo]] (a close ally of Suharto), invested the windfall income from rising oil prices into a myriad of other business activities such as shipping, steel, construction, real estate, and hospitals. These businesses were mismanaged and riddled with corruption. The government was forced to bail out the company, in the process nearly doubling the [[national debt]], while Ibnu Sutowo was removed from his position.<ref>Schwatrz (1994)</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy===\n\n[[File:SuhartoNAMLusaka1970.jpg|thumb|upright|Suharto attends 1970 meeting of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in [[Lusaka]].]]\n\nUpon assuming power, Suharto government adopted a policy of [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] in the [[Cold War]] with quiet alignment with the [[Western Bloc|Western bloc]] (including [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]]) with the objective of securing support for Indonesia's economic recovery. Western countries, impressed by Suharto's strong anti-communist credentials, were quick to offer their support. [[China-Indonesia relations|Diplomatic relations]] with [[China]] was suspended in October 1967 due to suspicion of Chinese involvement in [[30 September Movement]] (diplomatic relations was only restored in 1990). Due to Suharto's destruction of PKI the [[Soviet Union]] embargoed military sales to Indonesia. However, from 1967 to 1970 foreign minister [[Adam Malik]] managed to secure several agreements to restructure massive debts incurred by Sukarno from the Soviet Union and other Eastern European communist states. Regionally, having ended [[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation|confrontation with Malaysia]] in August 1966, Indonesia became a founding member of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) in August 1967. This organisation is designed to establish a peaceful relationship between Southeast Asian countries free from conflicts such as the ongoing [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" />\n\nIn 1974, the neighbouring colony of [[Portuguese Timor]] descended into [[civil war]] after the withdrawal of Portuguese authority following the [[Carnation Revolution]], whereby the leftist-leaning [[Fretilin]] (''Frente Revolucion\u00e1ria de Timor-Leste Independente'') emerged triumphant. After persuasion from Western countries (including from US president [[Gerald Ford|Gerald R. Ford]] and [[Australia]]n [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister]] [[Gough Whitlam]] during their visits to Indonesia), Suharto decided to intervene to prevent establishment of a communist state. After an unsuccessful attempt of covert support to Timorese anti-communist groups [[Timorese Democratic Union|UDT]] and [[APODETI]], Suharto authorised a full-scale [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invasion]] of the colony on 7 December 1975 followed with its official annexation as Indonesia's 27th province of [[East Timor]] in July 1976. The \"encirclement and annihilation\" campaigns of 1977\u20131979 broke the back of Fretilin control over the hinterlands, although continuing [[guerilla warfare|guerilla]] resistance forced the government to maintain strong military presence in the half-island until 1999. An estimated minimum of 90,800 and maximum of 213,600 conflict-related deaths occurred in East Timor during [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|Indonesian rule (1974\u20131999)]]; namely, 17,600\u201319,600 killings and 73,200 to 194,000 'excess' deaths from hunger and illness.

In 1966, the manufacturing sector made up less than 10% of GDP (mostly industries related to oil and agriculture). By 1997, manufacturing had risen to 25% of GDP whereby 53% of exports consisted of manufactured products. The government invested into massive infrastructure development (notably the launching of series of [[Palapa]] telecommunication satellites), consequently Indonesian infrastructure in the mid-1990s was considered at par with China. Suharto was keen to capitalise on such achievements to justify his regime, and an [[People's Consultative Assembly|MPR]] resolution in 1983 granted him the title of \"Father of Development\".<ref>Rock (2003), p.3</ref>\n\nSuharto government's health-care programs (such as the ''Puskesmas'' program) increased life expectancy from 47 years (1966) to 67 years (1997) while cutting the [[infant mortality]] rate by more than 60%. The government's ''Inpres'' program launched in 1973 resulted in primary school enrolment ratio reaching 90% by 1983 while almost eliminating education gap between boys and girls. Sustained support for agriculture resulted in Indonesia reaching rice self-sufficiency by 1984, an unprecedented achievement which earned Suharto a gold medal from [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] in November 1985.<ref>Rock (2003), p.4</ref>\n\nIn the early 1980s, Suharto government responded to the fall in oil exports due to the [[1980s oil glut]] by successfully shifting the main pillar of the economy into [[export]]-oriented labour-intensive manufacturing, made globally competitive by Indonesia's low wages and a series of currency [[devaluations]]. [[Industrialization]] was mostly undertaken by ethnic-Chinese companies which evolved into immense [[conglomerate (business)|conglomerates]] dominating the nation's economy. The largest conglomeracies are the [[Salim Group]] led by [[Liem Sioe Liong|Liem Sioe Liong (Sudono Salim)]], [[Sinar Mas Group]] led by [[Eka Tjipta Widjaja|Oei Ek Tjong (Eka Tjipta Widjaja)]], [[Astra Group]] led by [[William Soeryadjaya|Tjia Han Poen (William Soeryadjaya)]], [[Lippo Group]] led by [[Mochtar Riady|Lie Mo Tie (Mochtar Riady)]], Barito Pacific Group led by [[Prajogo Pangestu|Pang Djun Phen (Prajogo Pangestu)]], and Nusamba Group led by [[Bob Hasan]]. Suharto decided to support the growth of small number of [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese-Indonesian]] conglomerates since they cannot pose political challenge due to their ethnic-minority status, but from his past experience he deemed them to possess the skills and capital needed to create real growth for the country. In exchange for Suharto's patronage, the conglomerates provided vital financing for his \"regime maintenance\" activities.<ref>http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/40018/3/wp632.pdf</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s, the Suharto government decided to de-regulate the [[banking]] sector to encourage savings and providing domestic source of financing required for growth. Suharto decreed the \"October Package of 1988\" (''PAKTO 88'') which eased requirements for establishing banks and extending credit; resulting in a 50% increase in number of banks from 1989 to 1991. To promote savings, the government introduced the ''TABANAS'' ({{lang-id|Tabungan Pembangunan Nasional}}, National Development Savings) program to the populace. [[Jakarta Stock Exchange]], re-opened in 1977, recorded bull-run due to spree of domestic [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]]s and influx of foreign funds after deregulation in 1990. The sudden availability of credit fuelled strong economic growth in the early 1990s, but the weak regulatory environment of the financial sector sowed the seeds of the catastrophic crisis in 1997 which eventually destroyed Suharto's regime.<ref>http://www.bi.go.id/NR/rdonlyres/A6011CBA-1B4E-49B1-9DDC-CB01AB6C60D0/19386/SejarahPerbankanPeriode19831997.pdf</ref>\n\nThe growth of the economy was coincided by rapid expansion in corruption, collusion, and nepotism (''Korupsi, Kolusi, dan Nepotisme / KKN''). In the early 1980s, Suharto's children, particularly [[Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana]] (\"Tutut\"), [[Tommy Suharto|Hutomo Mandala Putra (\"Tommy\")]], and Bambang Trihatmodjo, has grown into greedy adults. Their companies were given lucrative government contracts and protected from market competition by monopolies. Examples include the [[List of toll roads in Indonesia|toll-expressway]] market which was [[monopoly|monopolised]] by Tutut, the national car project monopolised by Bambang and Tommy, the clove industry monopolized by a Tommy-linked governmental body called the Clove Buffering and Marketing Administration ({{lang-id|Badan Penyangga dan Pemasaran Cengkeh}}, BPPC) and even the cinema market monopolised by [[21 Cineplex]] owned by Suharto's cousin Sudwikatmono. The family is said to control about 36,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 of real estate in Indonesia, including 100,000&nbsp;m\u00b2 of prime office space in Jakarta and nearly 40% of the land in East Timor. Additionally, Suharto's family members received free shares in 1,251 of Indonesia's most lucrative domestic companies (mostly run by Suharto's ethnic-Chinese cronies), while foreign-owned companies were encouraged to establish \"strategic partnerships\" with Suharto family's companies. Meanwhile, the myriad of ''yayasan''s run by Suharto family grew even larger, levying millions of dollars in \"donations\" from the public and private sectors each year.<ref name=\"BBC_20040325\">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3567745.stm | title=Suharto tops corruption rankings |publisher=BBC News | date= 25 March 2004 | accessdate=4 February 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"Global Corruption Report\">{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/content/download/4459/26786/file/Introduction_to_political_corruption.pdf |title=Global Corruption Report|publisher=Transparency International |accessdate=6 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Grip on power===\n\n[[File:William cohen with suharto.jpg|thumb|Suharto with [[United States Secretary of Defense|US Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen]], 14 January 1998.]]\n\nBy the 1980s, Suharto's grip on power was very strong, maintained by emasculation of civil society, engineered elections, liberal use of military's coercive powers, and a strong economy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Modern Indonesia Since C. 1200|last=Ricklefs|first=Merle Calvin|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2001|isbn=9780804744805|location=Stanford, CA|pages=342\u2013387}}</ref> Upon his retirement from the military in June 1976, Suharto undertook re-organization of the armed forces that concentrates power away from commanders to the president. In March 1983, he appointed General [[Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani]] as head of the armed forces. A tough and capable soldier, Moerdani is also a Roman Catholic, which precluded him from posing a political threat to Suharto.<ref>Elson (2001), p.457-460</ref>\n\nSuharto ruthlessly suppressed elements who disturbed the tranquility of the New Order society. From 1983 to 1985, army death squads murdered up to 10,000 suspected criminals in response to a spike in crime rate (dubbed \"[[Petrus Killings]]\"). Suharto's imposition of [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] as sole ideology caused protests from conservative Islamic groups who considers the Islamic law (''[[sharia]]'') to be above any human conceptions. In September 1984, a violent demonstration in the [[Tanjung Priok]] area of Jakarta by conservative Muslims led to soldiers [[Tanjung Priok massacre|opening fire]], massacring up to 100 protesters. A retaliatory series of small bombings (notably the bombing of [[Borobudur]] Temple in January 1985) led to arrests of hundreds of conservative Islamic activists, ranging from future parliamentary leader AM Fatwa to radical cleric [[Abu Bakar Bashir]] (future initiator of terrorist group [[Jemaah Islamiyah]]). Attacks on police by resurgent [[Libya]]n-aided [[Free Aceh Movement]] in 1989 led to a brutal military operation (\"''[[1990\u201398 Indonesian military operations in Aceh|Operasi Jaring Merah]]''\") which ended the insurgency by 1992 by killing of 2,000 people. More subtly, the Suharto government sought to better control the press by issuing a 1984 law requiring all media to possess a press operating licence (''SIUPP'') which can be revoked at any time by the Ministry of Information.       \n<ref>Aspinal (1999), pp. ii\u2013iii</ref>\n\nIn the international arena, Western concern over Communism waned with the end of the [[Cold War]], and Suharto's human rights record came under greater international scrutiny. The November 1991 [[Santa Cruz Massacre]] in [[Dili]], East Timor, resulted in the [[Congress of the United States]] passing limitations on [[IMET]] assistance to the Indonesian Military. Suharto retaliated by cancelling purchase orders for American [[F-16]] fighter jets in 1997.<ref name=\"HR_IMET\">{{cite web | title=H.AMDT.647 (A003): An amendment to prohibit any funds appropriated in the bill to be used for military education and training assistance to Indonesia | url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d102:HZ00647: | publisher=THOMAS (Library of Congress) | accessdate=4 February 2006 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113050730/http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d102:HZ00647: | archivedate=13 January 2016 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"UNHCHR\">{{cite web | title= United Nations High Commission on Human Rights resolution 1993/97: Situation in East Timor | url=http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/81427c9bacaf9847c1256c6800603ff2?Opendocument | publisher=United Nations | accessdate=4 February 2006}}</ref> When [[Netherlands]] condemned the Santa Cruz Massacre, Suharto retaliated by expelling the Dutch from IGGI in March 1992 and renaming this aid organisation into '''Consultative Group on Indonesia''' (CGI) which continued increasing aid to Indonesia.<ref>Elson (2001), p.501-503</ref> Realizing this trend, Suharto sought wider alliances under the rubric of economic development, away from over-reliance to [[United States]] support. Suharto was elected as head of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in 1992, while Indonesia is a founding member of [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] in 1989 and host to the [[Bogor]] APEC Summit in 1994.<ref>Elson (2001), p.510-511</ref>\n\nDomestically, the growing rapaciousness of Suharto's family created discontent amongst the military who lost access to power and lucrative rent-seeking opportunities. In the March 1988 [[People's Consultative Assembly|MPR]] session, military legislators attempted to pressure Suharto by unsuccessfully seeking to block nomination of [[Sudharmono]], a Suharto-loyalist, as vice-president. After General [[Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani|Moerdani]] voiced his objections on Suharto family's corruption, the president dismissed him from the position of military chief. Suharto proceeded to slowly \"de-militarize\" his regime; he dissolved the powerful [[Kopkamtib]] in September 1988 and ensured key military positions were held by loyalists.<ref>Pour (2007), p.242-264</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to diversify his power base away from the military, Suharto began courting support from Islamic elements. He undertook a much-publicized [[hajj]] pilgrimage in 1991, took up name of '''Haji Mohammad Suharto''', started promoting Islamic values into society, and promoted the careers of Islamic-oriented generals (dubbed the \"green generals\"). To win support from the nascent Muslim business community who resented dominance of Chinese-Indonesian conglomerates, Suharto formed the ICMI (Indonesian Islamic Intellectuals' Association) in November 1990, which was led by his protege [[BJ Habibie]], the Minister for Research and Technology since 1978. During this period of Suharto's cozying with Islamists, race riots against ethnic-Chinese began to occur quite regularly, beginning with the April 1994 riot in [[Medan]].<ref name=\"Elson 2001, p.211-214\">Elson (2001), p.211-214</ref>\n\nBy the 1990s, Suharto's government came to be dominated by sycophantic civilian politicians such as [[B. J. Habibie|Habibie]], [[Harmoko]], [[Ginandjar Kartasasmita]], and [[Akbar Tanjung]], who owed their position solely to Suharto. As a sign of Habibie's growing clout, when several prominent Indonesian magazines criticised Habibie's purchase of almost the entire fleet of the disbanded [[East German Navy]] in 1993 (most of the vessels were of scrap-value), Suharto ordered the offending publications to be closed down on 21 June 1994.<ref name=\"Elson 2001, p.211-214\"/>\n\nBy the 1990s, elements the growing Indonesian [[middle class]] created by Suharto's economic development, was becoming restless with his autocracy and corruption of his children, fuelling demands for \"[[Reformasi (Indonesia)|Reformasi]]\" (reform) of the 30-year-old New Order system. By 1996, [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]], the daughter of [[Sukarno]] and chairwoman of the normally compliant [[Indonesian Democratic Party|PDI]], was becoming a rallying point for this growing discontent. In response, Suharto backed a co-opted faction of PDI led by Suryadi, which removed Megawati from the chair. On 27 July 1996, an attack by soldiers and hired thugs led by Lieutenant-General [[Sutiyoso]] on demonstrating Megawati supporters in Jakarta resulted in fatal riots and looting. This incident was followed by waves of arrests on 200 democracy activists, 23 of whom were kidnapped (some were murdered) by army squads called ''Tim Mawar'' (\"Rose Team\") led by Suharto's son-in-law, Major-General [[Prabowo Subianto]].<ref>Elson (2001), p. 284-287</ref> Regardless of these incidents, as late as mid-1997, Suharto's grip on power seemed as secure as ever with the military led by his loyalists, all opposition groups suppressed, and the economy in good shape.\n\n==Downfall==\n\n{{Main|Fall of Suharto}}\n\n[[File:Suharto resigns.jpg|thumb|Suharto reads his address of resignation at Merdeka Palace on 21 May 1998.

In the private sector, many Indonesian corporations had been borrowing heavily in lower-interest US dollar denomination while their revenues were mostly in rupiah; their debt rapidly increased as the US dollar appreciated, leaving many companies virtually bankrupt. These companies desperately sold rupiah and bought US dollars, causing the rupiah's value to drop from Rp 2,600 per dollar in August 1997 to over Rp 14,800 per dollar by January 1998. Efforts by the [[Bank Indonesia|central bank]] to defend its managed float regime by selling dollar had little impact and instead drained Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves, forcing the government to free-float the currency and seek liquidity aid from [[IMF]] (International Monetary Fund).<ref>http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2001/wp0152.pdf</ref>\n\nIn exchange for US$43 billion in liquidity aid, Suharto was forced to sign three letters of intent from October 1997 to April 1998 with the IMF. The LoI promised reforms which includes closing banks owned by Suharto's family and cronies starting in November 1997. Plan to close unhealthy banks resulted in a [[bank run]] that drained liquidity; depositors knew of the poor regulations and risky related-party credit extensions of Indonesian banks. In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantee for bank deposits, and set-up [[Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency]] to take-over management of troubled banks to prevent collapse of the financial system. Based on IMF recommendation, the government increased interest rates to 70% pa in February 1998 to control spiralling inflation caused by higher price of imports, but this action killed availability of credit to the corporate sector. Suharto's foot-dragging in undertaking reforms demanded by IMF in relation to his children's business further weakened public confidence.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" /><ref name=\"Vickers 2005, pp. 203\u2013207\">Vickers (2005), pp. 203\u2013207.</ref> According to American economist [[Steve Hanke]], invited by Suharto in February 1998 to plan [[currency board]] system, President [[Bill Clinton]] and IMF managing director [[Michel Camdessus]] deliberately worsened the Indonesian crisis to force Suharto to resign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/fall-rupiah-suharto |title=On the Fall of the Rupiah and Suharto &#124; Cato Institute |publisher=Cato.org |date=27 January 2007 |accessdate=6 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nEconomic meltdown was accompanied by increasing political tension. Anti-Chinese riots occurred in [[Situbondo]] (1996), [[Tasikmalaya]] (1996), [[Banjarmasin]] (1997), and [[Makassar]] (1997); while bloody ethnic clashes broke out between the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] and [[Madurese people|Madurese]] settlers in [[Central Kalimantan]] in 1997. After violent campaign season, [[Golkar]] won the heavily rigged [[1997 Indonesian elections|May 1997 MPR elections]]. The new MPR voted unanimously to re-elect Suharto to another five-year term in office in March 1998, upon which he proceeded to appoint his protege [[BJ Habibie]] as vice-president while stacking the cabinet with his own family and business associates (his daughter [[Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana|Tutut]] became Minister of Social Affairs). Government's increase of fuel prices by 70% of 4 May triggered anti-Chinese rioting in [[Medan]]. With Suharto increasingly seen as the source of the country's mounting economic and political crises, prominent political figures spoke out against his presidency (notably Muslim politician [[Amien Rais]]), and in January 1998 university students began organising nationwide demonstrations.<ref>Elson (2001), p.267</ref>\n\nIn [[West Kalimantan]] there was communal violence between [[Dayak people|Dayaks]] and [[Madurese people|Madurese]] in 1996, in the [[Sambas conflict]] in 1999 and the [[Sampit conflict]] 2001, resulting in large-scale massacres of Madurese.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ploughshares.ca/libraries/ACRText/ACR-IndonesiaKalimantan.html|title=404 Error - Page Not Found|author=|date=|website=ploughshares.ca}}</ref><ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/dayak.htm Dayak]</ref><ref>[http://www.akademidayak.com/2008/06/relationship-between-dayak-and-madura.html THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DAYAK AND MADURA IN RETOK by Yohanes Supriyadi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324143522/http://www.akademidayak.com/2008/06/relationship-between-dayak-and-madura.html |date=24 March 2012 }}</ref> In the Sambas conflict, both [[Malay Indonesian|Malays]] and Dayaks massacred Madurese.\n\nThe crisis climaxed when Suharto was on a state visit to [[Egypt]] in May 1998.

Various theories exist on the origins of the racial pogrom against the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic-Chinese]]. One theory suggested rivalry between military chief General [[Wiranto]] and [[Prabowo Subianto]], while another theory suggested deliberate provocation by Suharto to divert blame for the crisis to the ethnic-Chinese and discredit the student movement.<ref>Purdey (2006), p.148-150</ref>\n\nOn 16 May, tens of thousands of university students occupied the [[DPR/MPR Building|parliament building]], demanding Suharto's resignation. Upon Suharto's return to Jakarta, he tried to defend his presidency by offering to resign in 2003 and to reshuffle his cabinet. These efforts failed when his political allies deserted him by refusing to join the proposed new cabinet. According to military chief [[Wiranto]], on 18 May, Suharto issued a decree which provided authority to him to take any measures to restore security (similar to the 1966 [[Supersemar]]), however Wiranto decided not to enforce the decree to prevent conflict with the population.<ref>Wiranto (2003), p.67-69</ref> On 21 May 1998, Suharto announced his resignation, upon which vice-president [[B.

Suharto used this term to contrast his rule with that of his predecessor, [[Sukarno]] (dubbed the \"Old Order,\" or ''Orde Lama''). The term \"New Order\" in more recent times has become synonymous with the Suharto years (1966\u20131998).\n\nImmediately following the [[30 September Movement|attempted coup]] in 1965, the political situation was uncertain, but the Suharto's New Order found much popular support from groups wanting a separation from Indonesia's problems since its independence. The 'generation of 66' (''[[Angkatan 66]]'') epitomised talk of a new group of young leaders and new intellectual thought. Following Indonesia's communal and political conflicts, and its economic collapse and social breakdown of the late 1950s through to the mid-1960s,  the \"New Order\" was committed to achieving and maintaining political order, economic development, and the removal of mass participation in the political process. The features of the \"New Order\" established from the late 1960s were thus a strong political role for the military, the bureaucratisation and corporatisation of political and societal organisations, and selective but effective repression of opponents. Strident [[anti-communism]] remained a hallmark of the regime for its subsequent 32 years.\n\nWithin a few years, however, many of its original allies had become indifferent or averse to the New Order, which comprised a military faction supported by a narrow civilian group. Among much of the pro-democracy movement which forced Suharto to resign in the [[1998 Indonesian Revolution]] and then gained power, the term \"New Order\" has come to be used pejoratively. It is frequently employed to describe figures who were either tied to the Suharto period, or who upheld the practises of his authoritarian regime, such as corruption, [[collusion]] and [[nepotism]] (widely known by the acronym KKN: ''korupsi'', ''kolusi'', ''nepotisme'').<ref>[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2001/08/24/stop-talk-kkn.html Stop talk of KKN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026103742/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2001/08/24/stop-talk-kkn.html |date=26 October 2014 }}. The Jakarta Post (24 August 2001).</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Liberal democracy period in Indonesia|Guided Democracy in Indonesia}}\n[[Sukarno]] was Indonesia's founding president, a position he had held since the Republic's formation in 1945. In 1955, the first general parliamentary elections delivered an unstable parliament and from the late 1950s, Sukarno's rule became increasingly [[Autocracy|autocratic]] under his \"[[Guided Democracy]]\". Described as the great \u2018\u2019Dalang\u2019\u2019, or puppet master, Sukarno\u2019s position depended on his concept of [[NASAKOM]] (Nationalism, Religion, Communism) whereby he sought to balance the competing Indonesian Military, Islamic groups, and the increasingly powerful [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI). To the resentment of the Military and Muslim groups, this arrangement became increasingly reliant on the PKI which had become the country\u2019s strongest political party.\n\nSukarno\u2019s [[Antiimperialism|anti-imperial]] ideology saw Indonesia increasingly dependent on the [[Soviet Union]] and [[People's Republic of China|China]] which was met with indignation from [[Western world|Western]] countries.

He instituted a Pancasila indoctrination program that must be attended by all Indonesians, from primary school students to office workers.<ref name=\"epress.anu.edu.au\"/> Pancasila, a rather vague and generalist set of principles originally formulated by Sukarno in 1945, was vigorously promoted as a sacrosanct national ideology which represents the ancient wisdom of Indonesian people even before the entry of foreign-based religions such as [[Hinduism]] or [[Islam]]. In a July 1982 speech which reflected his deep infatuation with [[Javanese beliefs]], Suharto glorified Pancasila as a key to reach the perfect life (''ilmu kasampurnaning hurip'') of harmony with God and fellow mankind.<ref name=\"epress.anu.edu.au\"/> In practice, however, the vagueness of Pancasila was exploited by Suharto's government to justify their actions and to condemn their opponents as \"anti-Pancasila\".<ref name=\"epress.anu.edu.au\"/>\n\nThe ''[[Dwifungsi]]'' (\"Dual Function\") policy allowed the military to have an active role in all levels of Indonesian government, economy, and society.\n\n===Neutralisation of internal dissent===\nHaving been appointed president, Suharto still needed to share power with various elements including Indonesian generals who considered Suharto as mere ''[[primus inter pares]]'' as well as Islamic and student groups who participated in the anti-communist purge. Suharto, aided by his \"Office of Personal Assistants\" (''[[Aspri]]'') clique of military officers from his days as commander of Diponegoro Division, particularly [[Ali Murtopo]], began to systematically cement his hold on power by subtly sidelining potential rivals while rewarding loyalists with political position and monetary incentives.\n\nHaving successfully stood-down MPRS chairman General [[Abdul Haris Nasution|Nasution]]'s 1968 attempt to introduce a bill which would have severely curtailed presidential authority, Suharto had him removed from his position as MPRS chairman in 1969 and forced his early retirement from the military in 1972. In 1967, generals HR Dharsono, [[Kemal Idris]], and [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]] (dubbed \"New Order Radicals\") opposed Suharto's decision to allow the participation of existing political parties in elections in favour of a non-ideological [[two-party system]] somewhat similar to those found in many [[Western world|Western]] countries. Suharto then proceeded to send Dharsono overseas as ambassador, while [[Kemal Idris]] and [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]] were sent to distant [[North Sumatra]] and [[South Sulawesi]] as regional commanders.<ref>Wanandi, 2012, p. 56-59</ref>\n\nWhile many original leaders of the 1966 student movement (''[[Angkatan 66]]'') were successfully co-opted into the regime, it faced large student demonstrations challenging the legitimacy of the 1971 elections, the ''Golput'' Movement, the costly construction of [[Taman Mini Indonesia Indah]] theme park (1972), the domination of foreign capitalists ([[Malari Incident]] of 1974), and the lack of [[term limit]]s of Suharto's presidency (1978). The New Order responded by imprisoning student activists and sending army units to occupy the campus of the [[Bandung Institute of Technology]] in 1978. In April 1978, Suharto ended the campus unrest by issuing a decree on the \"Normalization of Campus Life\" (NKK) which prohibited political activities on-campus not related to academic pursuits.<ref>Wanandi, 2012, p. 60-68</ref><ref>Aspinal (1999), p.ii</ref>\n\nIn 1980, fifty prominent figures political figures signed the [[Petition of Fifty]] which criticised Suharto's use of [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] to silence his critics. Suharto refused to address the petitioners' concerns, and some of them were imprisoned with others having restrictions imposed on their movements.<ref>Wanandi, 2012, p. 86-88</ref>\n\n===Domestic politics and security===\n\n====Depoliticization====\nTo placate demands from civilian politicians for the holding of elections, as manifested in MPRS resolutions of 1966 and 1967, Suharto government formulated a series of laws regarding elections as well as the structure and duties of parliament which were passed by MPRS in November 1969 after protracted negotiations. The law provided for a [[People's Consultative Assembly|parliament (''Madjelis Permusjawaratan Rakjat''/MPR)]] with the power to elect presidents consisting of a lower house ([[People's Representative Council|''Dewan Perwakilan Rakjat''/DPR]]) and regional representatives. 100 of the 460 members of DPR were directly appointed by the government, while the remaining seats were allocated to political parties based on results of a general election. This mechanism ensures significant government control over legislative affairs, particularly the appointment of presidents.<ref>Ricklefs (1982), p.76-77</ref><ref>Elson (2001), p.184-186</ref>\n\nTo participate in the elections, Suharto realised the need to align himself with a political party. After initially considering alignment with Sukarno's old party, the [[Indonesian National Party|PNI]], in 1969 Suharto took control of an obscure military-run federation of [[Non-governmental organisation|NGOs]] called [[Golkar]] (\"Functional Group\") and transform it into his electoral vehicle under the co-ordination of his right-hand man [[Ali Murtopo]]. The [[1971 Indonesian legislative election|first general election]] was held on 3 July 1971 with ten participants: [[Golkar]], four Islamic parties, as well as five nationalist and Christian parties. Campaigning on a non-ideological platform of \"development\", and aided by official government support and subtle intimidation tactics. Golkar secured 62.8% of the popular vote. The March 1973 general session of the MPR promptly appointed Suharto to a second term in office with Sultan [[Hamengkubuwono IX]] as vice-president.<ref>Schwarz (1992), p. 32</ref>\n\nOn 5 January 1973, to allow better control, the government forced the four Islamic parties to merge into the [[United Development Party|PPP]] (''Partai Persatuan Pembangunan''/United Development Party) while the five non-Islamic parties were fused into [[Indonesian Democratic Party|PDI]] (''Partai Demokrasi Indonesia''/Indonesian Democratic Party). The government ensured that these parties never developed effective opposition by controlling their leadership, while establishing the \"re-call\" system to remove any outspoken legislators from their positions. Using this system dubbed the \"[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] Democracy\", Golkar won the MPR general elections of [[1977 Indonesian legislative election|1977]], [[1982 Indonesian legislative election|1982]], [[1987 Indonesian legislative election|1987]], [[1992 Indonesian legislative election|1992]], and [[1997 Indonesian legislative election|1997]] with massive landslides. The elected MPR then proceeded to unanimously re-elect Suharto as president in 1978, 1983, 1988, 1993, and 1998.<ref>Schwarz (1992), p.32</ref>\n\n====Establishment of corporative groups====\n\nSuharto proceeded with social engineering projects designed to transform Indonesian society into a de-politicized \"floating mass\" supportive of the national mission of \"development\", a concept similar to [[corporatism]]. The government formed civil society groups to unite the populace in support of government programs. For instance, the government created and required all civil servants to join KORPRI ({{lang-id|Korps Pegawai Republik Indonesia}}, Employees' Corps of the Republic of Indonesia) in November 1971 to ensure their loyalty;<ref group=note>KORPRI still exists today and all civil servants are still required to join the corps.</ref>  organised the FBSI (''Federasi Buruh Seluruh Indonesia'') as the only legal labour union in February 1973 (later renamed as [[Confederation of All Indonesian Workers' Union|SPSI/''Serikat Pekerja Seluruh Indonesia'']] in 1985), established under the pretext of [[tripartism]], officially defined as Pancasilaist Industrial Relations ({{lang-id|Hubungan Industrial Pancasila}}) (while in fact it cements only business interests with the state); and established the [[Indonesian Ulema Council|MUI]] (''Majelis Ulama Indonesia'') in 1975 to control Islamic clerics. In 1966 to 1967, to promote assimiiation of the influential [[Chinese Indonesians]], the Suharto government passed [[Legislation on Chinese Indonesians|several laws]] as part of the so-called \"Basic Policy for the Solution of Chinese Problem\", whereby only one Chinese-language publication (controlled by the army) was allowed to continue, all Chinese cultural and religious expressions (including display of Chinese characters) were prohibited from public space, Chinese schools were phased out, and the ethnic Chinese were encouraged to take [[Indonesian-sounding names adopted by Chinese Indonesians|Indonesian-sounding names]]. In 1968, Suharto commenced the very successful [[family planning]] program (''Keluarga Berentjana''/KB) to stem the huge population growth rate and hence increase per-capita income. A lasting legacy from this period is the [[Enhanced Indonesian Spelling System|spelling reform]] of Indonesian language decreed by Suharto on 17 August 1972.<ref>Schwartz (1994), page 106</ref>\n\n====\"State Ibuism\"====\nInspired by [[Kejaw\u00e8n|Javanese culture]] of [[priyayi]], the New Order, during its consolidation era, is [[antifeminist]] and [[patriarchy|patriarchic]], which principle is officially called \"familyism\" ({{lang-id|kekeluargaan}}). In 1974, President Suharto established civil servant wives' corps ''Dharma Wanita'', organized under the doctrine of \"Five Women's ''[[Dharma]]''\" ({{lang-id|Pancadharma Wanita}}, an [[antifeminist]], [[patriarchy|patriarchic]] doctrine similar to Nazi Germany's [[Kinder, K\u00fcche, Kirche]]); a \"Family Training and Welfare\" programme ({{lang-id|[[w:id:Pembinaan Kesejahteraan Keluarga|Pembinaan dan Kesejahteraan Keluarga]]}}, '''PKK'''), which was rooted on a 1957 conference on [[home economics]] in [[Bogor]], was made compulsory in 1972, especially on rural regions.\n\nIt wasn't until 1980 that feminism would gain an uprising with the establishment of several foundations, for example the Annisa Shanti foundation (Yasanti).\n\n====Political stability====\n\nSuharto relied on the military to ruthlessly maintain domestic security, organised by the [[Kopkamtib]] (Operation Command for the Restoration of Security and Order) and BAKIN (State Intelligence Coordination Agency). To maintain strict control over the country, Suharto expanded the army's territorial system down to the village level, while military officers were appointed as regional heads under the rubric of the ''[[Dwifungsi]]'' (\"Dual Function\") of the military. By 1969, 70% of Indonesia's provincial governors and more than half of its district chiefs were active military officers. Suharto authorised ''Operasi Trisula'' which destroyed PKI remnants trying to organise a guerrilla base in the [[Blitar]] area in 1968 and ordered several military operations which ended the communist PGRS-Paraku insurgency in [[West Kalimantan]] (1967\u20131972). Attacks on oil workers by the first incarnation of [[Free Aceh Movement]] separatists under [[Hasan di Tiro]] in 1977 led to dispatch of small special forces detachments who quickly either killed or forced the movement's members to flee abroad.<ref>Conboy (2003), p. 262-265</ref> Notably, in March 1981, Suharto authorised a successful special forces mission to end [[Garuda Indonesia Flight 206|hijacking of a Garuda Indonesia flight]] by Islamic extremists at [[Don Muang Airport]] in [[Bangkok]].<ref>Elson (2001), p. 177-178</ref>\n\nTo comply with the [[New York Agreement]] of 1962 which required a plebiscite on integration of [[West Irian]] into Indonesia before end of 1969, the Suharto government began organising for a so-called \"[[Act of Free Choice]]\" scheduled on July\u2013August 1969. The government sent RPKAD special forces under [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]] which secured the surrender of several bands of the former Dutch-organized militia ([[Papuan Volunteer Corps|''Papoea Vrijwilligers Korps''/ PVK]]) at large in the jungles since the Indonesian takeover in 1963, while sending Catholic volunteers under [[Jusuf Wanandi]] to distribute consumer goods to promote pro-Indonesian sentiments. In March 1969, it was agreed that the plebiscite will be channelled via 1,025 tribal chiefs, citing the logistical challenge and political ignorance of the population. Using the above strategy, the plebiscite produced a unanimous decision for integration with Indonesia, which was duly noted by [[United Nations General Assembly]] in November 1969.<ref>Elson (2001), p. 178-279</ref>\n\n===Political Islam===\n\nUnder Suharto [[Islamism|political Islam]]ists were suppressed, and religious Muslims carefully watched by the Indonesian government. Several [[Christianity|Christian]] Generals who served under Suharto like [[Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani]] actively persecuted religious Muslims in the Indonesian military, which was described as being \"anti-Islamic\", denying religious Muslims promotions, and preventing them from praying in the barracks and banning them from even using the Islamic greeting \"Salaam Aleikum\", and these anti-Islamic policies were entirely supported by Suharto, despite Suharto being a Muslim himself, since he considered political Islam a threat to his power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trincoll.edu/depts/csrpl/rinvol3no1/east_timor.htm|title=East Timor|author=|date=|website=www.trincoll.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://salam-online.com/2012/12/mengenal-sosok-intelijen-anti-islam-3.html|title=Mengenal Sosok Intelijen Anti-Islam (3) - Salam Online|author=|date=13 December 2012|website=salam-online.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.salam-online.com/2012/12/mengenal-sosok-intelijen-anti-islam-2.html|title=Mengenal Sosok Intelijen Anti-Islam (2) - Salam Online|author=|date=8 December 2012|website=salam-online.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://salam-online.com/2012/12/mengenal-sosok-intelijen-anti-islam-1.html|title=Mengenal Sosok Intelijen Anti-Islam (1) - Salam Online|author=|date=8 December 2012|website=salam-online.com}}</ref> The Christian General Theo Syafei, who also served under Suharto, spoke out against political Islam coming to power in Indonesia, and insulted the Qur'an and Islam in remarks which were described as Islamophobic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voa-islam.com/news/indonesiana/2011/04/30/14434/jelang-ajal-sang-islam-phobi-theo-syafei-diserang-kanker-otak-langka/|title=Jelang Ajal, Sang 'Islam Phobi' Theo Syafei Diserang Kanker Otak Langka - VOA-ISLAM.COM|author=|date=|website=voa-islam.com}}</ref><ref>http://www.bekamsteriljakarta.com/2011/04/jelang-ajal-sang-phobi-theo-syafei.html</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://thejakartapost.com/news/1999/10/07/political-disillusionment-shadows-presidential-election.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505015415/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/1999/10/07/political-disillusionment-shadows-presidential-election.html |archivedate=5 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.people.my.id/go/view/24481/tokoh-senior-pdip-theo-syafei-meninggal.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505023724/http://news.people.my.id/go/view/24481/tokoh-senior-pdip-theo-syafei-meninggal.html |archivedate=5 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://us.politik.news.viva.co.id/news/read/217360-politisi-senior-pdip-theo-syafei-meninggal |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505002903/http://us.politik.news.viva.co.id/news/read/217360-politisi-senior-pdip-theo-syafei-meninggal |archivedate=5 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ahmadsumargono.net/konten.php?nama=Buku&op=detail_buku&id_buku=1&id=16 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505015242/http://www.ahmadsumargono.net/konten.php?nama=Buku&op=detail_buku&id_buku=1&id=16 |archivedate=5 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Economy===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F032437-0030, Berchtesgaden, Staatsbesuch Pr\u00e4sident Suharto.jpg|thumb|Suharto on a visit to [[West Germany]] in 1970.]]\n\nThe new president enlisted a group of mostly American-educated Indonesian [[Economics|economists]], dubbed the \"[[Berkeley Mafia]]\", to formulate government economic policy. By cutting subsidies and government debt, and reforming the exchange rate mechanism, inflation dropped from 660% in 1966 to 19% in 1969.

Suharto himself travelled to Western Europe and [[Japan]] in a series of trips to promote investment into Indonesia, starting in the natural resources sector. Among the first foreign investors to re-enter Indonesia were mining companies [[Freeport-McMoran|Freeport Sulphur Company]] and [[Vale Limited|International Nickel Company]], later followed by significant investment from Japanese, South Korean, and Taiwanese companies. From 1967, the government managed to secure low-interest foreign aid from ten countries grouped under the '''Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia''' (IGGI) to cover its budget deficit.<ref>Elson (2001), p. 170-172</ref>\n\nSuharto's government issued the Domestic Investment Law of June 1968 to allow development of a domestic [[Capitalism|capitalist]] class capable of motoring economic growth to supplement existing state-owned enterprises.

While some proceeds of these organisations were used for genuinely charitable purposes (such as building a heart-disease hospital by ''Yayasan Harapan Kita'' run by the first lady), most of the money was recycled as [[slush fund]]s to reward political allies to maintain support for Suharto's regime.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" />\n<ref name=\"KKN\">\n{{cite news\n| last = Koerner\n| first = Brendan\n| url = http://www.slate.com/id/2097858\n| title = How Did Suharto Steal $35 Billion?

However, from 1967 to 1970 foreign minister [[Adam Malik]] managed to secure several agreements to restructure massive debts incurred by Sukarno from the Soviet Union and other Eastern European communist states. Regionally, having ended [[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation|confrontation with Malaysia]] in August 1966, Indonesia became a founding member of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) in August 1967. This organisation is designed to establish a peaceful relationship between Southeast Asian countries free from conflicts such as the ongoing [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" />\n\nIn 1974, the neighbouring colony of [[Portuguese Timor]] descended into [[civil war]] after the withdrawal of Portuguese authority following the [[Carnation Revolution]], whereby the leftist-leaning [[Fretilin]] (''Frente Revolucion\u00e1ria de Timor-Leste Independente'') emerged triumphant. After persuasion from Western countries (including from US president [[Gerald Ford|Gerald R. Ford]] and [[Australia]]n [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister]] [[Gough Whitlam]] during their visits to Indonesia), Suharto decided to intervene to prevent establishment of a communist state. After an unsuccessful attempt of covert support to Timorese anti-communist groups [[Timorese Democratic Union|UDT]] and [[APODETI]], Suharto authorised a full-scale [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invasion]] of the colony on 7 December 1975 followed with its official annexation as Indonesia's 27th province of [[East Timor]] in July 1976. The \"encirclement and annihilation\" campaigns of 1977\u20131979 broke the back of Fretilin control over the hinterlands, although continuing [[guerilla warfare|guerilla]] resistance forced the government to maintain strong military presence in the half-island until 1999. An estimated minimum of 90,800 and maximum of 213,600 conflict-related deaths occurred in East Timor during [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|Indonesian rule (1974\u20131999)]]; namely, 17,600\u201319,600 killings and 73,200 to 194,000 'excess' deaths from hunger and illness.

In 1966, the manufacturing sector made up less than 10% of GDP (mostly industries related to oil and agriculture). By 1997, manufacturing had risen to 25% of GDP whereby 53% of exports consisted of manufactured products. The government invested into massive infrastructure development (notably the launching of series of [[Palapa]] telecommunication satellites), consequently Indonesian infrastructure in the mid-1990s was considered at par with China. Suharto was keen to capitalise on such achievements to justify his regime, and an [[People's Consultative Assembly|MPR]] resolution in 1983 granted him the title of \"Father of Development\".<ref>Rock (2003), p.3</ref>\n\nSuharto government's health-care programs (such as the ''Puskesmas'' program) increased life expectancy from 47 years (1966) to 67 years (1997) while cutting the [[infant mortality]] rate by more than 60%. The government's ''Inpres'' program launched in 1973 resulted in primary school enrolment ratio reaching 90% by 1983 while almost eliminating education gap between boys and girls. Sustained support for agriculture resulted in Indonesia reaching rice self-sufficiency by 1984, an unprecedented achievement which earned Suharto a gold medal from [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] in November 1985.<ref>Rock (2003), p.4</ref>\n\nIn the early 1980s, Suharto government responded to the fall in oil exports due to the [[1980s oil glut]] by successfully shifting the main pillar of the economy into [[export]]-oriented labour-intensive manufacturing, made globally competitive by Indonesia's low wages and a series of currency [[devaluations]]. [[Industrialization]] was mostly undertaken by ethnic-Chinese companies which evolved into immense [[conglomerate (business)|conglomerates]] dominating the nation's economy. The largest conglomeracies are the [[Salim Group]] led by [[Liem Sioe Liong|Liem Sioe Liong (Sudono Salim)]], [[Sinar Mas Group]] led by [[Eka Tjipta Widjaja|Oei Ek Tjong (Eka Tjipta Widjaja)]], [[Astra Group]] led by [[William Soeryadjaya|Tjia Han Poen (William Soeryadjaya)]], [[Lippo Group]] led by [[Mochtar Riady|Lie Mo Tie (Mochtar Riady)]], Barito Pacific Group led by [[Prajogo Pangestu|Pang Djun Phen (Prajogo Pangestu)]], and Nusamba Group led by [[Bob Hasan]]. Suharto decided to support the growth of small number of [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese-Indonesian]] conglomerates since they cannot pose political challenge due to their ethnic-minority status, but from his past experience he deemed them to possess the skills and capital needed to create real growth for the country. In exchange for Suharto's patronage, the conglomerates provided vital financing for his \"regime maintenance\" activities.<ref>http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/40018/3/wp632.pdf</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s, the Suharto government decided to de-regulate the [[banking]] sector to encourage savings and providing domestic source of financing required for growth. Suharto decreed the \"October Package of 1988\" (''PAKTO 88'') which eased requirements for establishing banks and extending credit; resulting in a 50% increase in number of banks from 1989 to 1991. To promote savings, the government introduced the ''TABANAS'' ({{lang-id|Tabungan Pembangunan Nasional}}, National Development Savings) program to the populace. [[Jakarta Stock Exchange]], re-opened in 1977, recorded bull-run due to spree of domestic [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]]s and influx of foreign funds after deregulation in 1990. The sudden availability of credit fuelled strong economic growth in the early 1990s, but the weak regulatory environment of the financial sector sowed the seeds of the catastrophic crisis in 1997 which eventually destroyed Suharto's regime.<ref>http://www.bi.go.id/NR/rdonlyres/A6011CBA-1B4E-49B1-9DDC-CB01AB6C60D0/19386/SejarahPerbankanPeriode19831997.pdf</ref>\n\nThe growth of the economy was coincided by rapid expansion in corruption, collusion, and nepotism (''Korupsi, Kolusi, dan Nepotisme / KKN''). In the early 1980s, Suharto's children, particularly [[Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana]] (\"Tutut\"), [[Tommy Suharto|Hutomo Mandala Putra (\"Tommy\")]], and Bambang Trihatmodjo, has grown into greedy adults. Their companies were given lucrative government contracts and protected from market competition by monopolies. Examples include the [[List of toll roads in Indonesia|toll-expressway]] market which was [[monopoly|monopolised]] by Tutut, the national car project monopolised by Bambang and Tommy, the clove industry monopolized by a Tommy-linked governmental body called the Clove Buffering and Marketing Administration ({{lang-id|Badan Penyangga dan Pemasaran Cengkeh}}, BPPC) and even the cinema market monopolised by [[21 Cineplex]] owned by Suharto's cousin Sudwikatmono. The family is said to control about 36,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 of real estate in Indonesia, including 100,000&nbsp;m\u00b2 of prime office space in Jakarta and nearly 40% of the land in East Timor. Additionally, Suharto's family members received free shares in 1,251 of Indonesia's most lucrative domestic companies (mostly run by Suharto's ethnic-Chinese cronies), while foreign-owned companies were encouraged to establish \"strategic partnerships\" with Suharto family's companies. Meanwhile, the myriad of ''yayasan''s run by Suharto family grew even larger, levying millions of dollars in \"donations\" from the public and private sectors each year.<ref name=\"BBC_20040325\">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3567745.stm | title=Suharto tops corruption rankings |publisher=BBC News | date= 25 March 2004 | accessdate=4 February 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"Global Corruption Report\">{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/content/download/4459/26786/file/Introduction_to_political_corruption.pdf |title=Global Corruption Report|publisher=Transparency International |accessdate=6 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Grip on power===\n\n[[File:William cohen with suharto.jpg|thumb|Suharto with [[United States Secretary of Defense|US Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen]], 14 January 1998.]]\n\nBy the 1980s, Suharto's grip on power was very strong, maintained by emasculation of civil society, engineered elections, liberal use of military's coercive powers, and a strong economy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Modern Indonesia Since C. 1200|last=Ricklefs|first=Merle Calvin|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2001|isbn=9780804744805|location=Stanford, CA|pages=342\u2013387}}</ref> Upon his retirement from the military in June 1976, Suharto undertook re-organization of the armed forces that concentrates power away from commanders to the president. In March 1983, he appointed General [[Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani]] as head of the armed forces. A tough and capable soldier, Moerdani is also a Roman Catholic, which precluded him from posing a political threat to Suharto.<ref>Elson (2001), p.457-460</ref>\n\nSuharto ruthlessly suppressed elements who disturbed the tranquility of the New Order society. From 1983 to 1985, army death squads murdered up to 10,000 suspected criminals in response to a spike in crime rate (dubbed \"[[Petrus Killings]]\"). Suharto's imposition of [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] as sole ideology caused protests from conservative Islamic groups who considers the Islamic law (''[[sharia]]'') to be above any human conceptions. In September 1984, a violent demonstration in the [[Tanjung Priok]] area of Jakarta by conservative Muslims led to soldiers [[Tanjung Priok massacre|opening fire]], massacring up to 100 protesters. A retaliatory series of small bombings (notably the bombing of [[Borobudur]] Temple in January 1985) led to arrests of hundreds of conservative Islamic activists, ranging from future parliamentary leader AM Fatwa to radical cleric [[Abu Bakar Bashir]] (future initiator of terrorist group [[Jemaah Islamiyah]]). Attacks on police by resurgent [[Libya]]n-aided [[Free Aceh Movement]] in 1989 led to a brutal military operation (\"''[[1990\u201398 Indonesian military operations in Aceh|Operasi Jaring Merah]]''\") which ended the insurgency by 1992 by killing of 2,000 people. More subtly, the Suharto government sought to better control the press by issuing a 1984 law requiring all media to possess a press operating licence (''SIUPP'') which can be revoked at any time by the Ministry of Information.       \n<ref>Aspinal (1999), pp. ii\u2013iii</ref>\n\nIn the international arena, Western concern over Communism waned with the end of the [[Cold War]], and Suharto's human rights record came under greater international scrutiny. The November 1991 [[Santa Cruz Massacre]] in [[Dili]], East Timor, resulted in the [[Congress of the United States]] passing limitations on [[IMET]] assistance to the Indonesian Military. Suharto retaliated by cancelling purchase orders for American [[F-16]] fighter jets in 1997.<ref name=\"HR_IMET\">{{cite web | title=H.AMDT.647 (A003): An amendment to prohibit any funds appropriated in the bill to be used for military education and training assistance to Indonesia | url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d102:HZ00647: | publisher=THOMAS (Library of Congress) | accessdate=4 February 2006 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113050730/http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d102:HZ00647: | archivedate=13 January 2016 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"UNHCHR\">{{cite web | title= United Nations High Commission on Human Rights resolution 1993/97: Situation in East Timor | url=http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/81427c9bacaf9847c1256c6800603ff2?Opendocument | publisher=United Nations | accessdate=4 February 2006}}</ref> When [[Netherlands]] condemned the Santa Cruz Massacre, Suharto retaliated by expelling the Dutch from IGGI in March 1992 and renaming this aid organisation into '''Consultative Group on Indonesia''' (CGI) which continued increasing aid to Indonesia.<ref>Elson (2001), p.501-503</ref> Realizing this trend, Suharto sought wider alliances under the rubric of economic development, away from over-reliance to [[United States]] support. Suharto was elected as head of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in 1992, while Indonesia is a founding member of [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] in 1989 and host to the [[Bogor]] APEC Summit in 1994.<ref>Elson (2001), p.510-511</ref>\n\nDomestically, the growing rapaciousness of Suharto's family created discontent amongst the military who lost access to power and lucrative rent-seeking opportunities. In the March 1988 [[People's Consultative Assembly|MPR]] session, military legislators attempted to pressure Suharto by unsuccessfully seeking to block nomination of [[Sudharmono]], a Suharto-loyalist, as vice-president. After General [[Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani|Moerdani]] voiced his objections on Suharto family's corruption, the president dismissed him from the position of military chief. Suharto proceeded to slowly \"de-militarize\" his regime; he dissolved the powerful [[Kopkamtib]] in September 1988 and ensured key military positions were held by loyalists.<ref>Pour (2007), p.242-264</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to diversify his power base away from the military, Suharto began courting support from Islamic elements. He undertook a much-publicized [[hajj]] pilgrimage in 1991, took up name of '''Haji Mohammad Suharto''', started promoting Islamic values into society, and promoted the careers of Islamic-oriented generals (dubbed the \"green generals\"). To win support from the nascent Muslim business community who resented dominance of Chinese-Indonesian conglomerates, Suharto formed the ICMI (Indonesian Islamic Intellectuals' Association) in November 1990, which was led by his protege [[BJ Habibie]], the Minister for Research and Technology since 1978. During this period of Suharto's cozying with Islamists, race riots against ethnic-Chinese began to occur quite regularly, beginning with the April 1994 riot in [[Medan]].<ref name=\"Elson 2001, p.211-214\">Elson (2001), p.211-214</ref>\n\nBy the 1990s, Suharto's government came to be dominated by sycophantic civilian politicians such as [[B. J. Habibie|Habibie]], [[Harmoko]], [[Ginandjar Kartasasmita]], and [[Akbar Tanjung]], who owed their position solely to Suharto. As a sign of Habibie's growing clout, when several prominent Indonesian magazines criticised Habibie's purchase of almost the entire fleet of the disbanded [[East German Navy]] in 1993 (most of the vessels were of scrap-value), Suharto ordered the offending publications to be closed down on 21 June 1994.<ref name=\"Elson 2001, p.211-214\"/>\n\nBy the 1990s, elements the growing Indonesian [[middle class]] created by Suharto's economic development, was becoming restless with his autocracy and corruption of his children, fuelling demands for \"[[Reformasi (Indonesia)|Reformasi]]\" (reform) of the 30-year-old New Order system. By 1996, [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]], the daughter of [[Sukarno]] and chairwoman of the normally compliant [[Indonesian Democratic Party|PDI]], was becoming a rallying point for this growing discontent. In response, Suharto backed a co-opted faction of PDI led by Suryadi, which removed Megawati from the chair. On 27 July 1996, an attack by soldiers and hired thugs led by Lieutenant-General [[Sutiyoso]] on demonstrating Megawati supporters in Jakarta resulted in fatal riots and looting. This incident was followed by waves of arrests on 200 democracy activists, 23 of whom were kidnapped (some were murdered) by army squads called ''Tim Mawar'' (\"Rose Team\") led by Suharto's son-in-law, Major-General [[Prabowo Subianto]].<ref>Elson (2001), p. 284-287</ref> Regardless of these incidents, as late as mid-1997, Suharto's grip on power seemed as secure as ever with the military led by his loyalists, all opposition groups suppressed, and the economy in good shape.\n\n==Downfall==\n\n{{Main|Fall of Suharto}}\n\n[[File:Suharto resigns.jpg|thumb|Suharto reads his address of resignation at Merdeka Palace on 21 May 1998.

In the private sector, many Indonesian corporations had been borrowing heavily in lower-interest US dollar denomination while their revenues were mostly in rupiah; their debt rapidly increased as the US dollar appreciated, leaving many companies virtually bankrupt. These companies desperately sold rupiah and bought US dollars, causing the rupiah's value to drop from Rp 2,600 per dollar in August 1997 to over Rp 14,800 per dollar by January 1998. Efforts by the [[Bank Indonesia|central bank]] to defend its managed float regime by selling dollar had little impact and instead drained Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves, forcing the government to free-float the currency and seek liquidity aid from [[IMF]] (International Monetary Fund).<ref>http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2001/wp0152.pdf</ref>\n\nIn exchange for US$43 billion in liquidity aid, Suharto was forced to sign three letters of intent from October 1997 to April 1998 with the IMF. The LoI promised reforms which includes closing banks owned by Suharto's family and cronies starting in November 1997. Plan to close unhealthy banks resulted in a [[bank run]] that drained liquidity; depositors knew of the poor regulations and risky related-party credit extensions of Indonesian banks. In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantee for bank deposits, and set-up [[Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency]] to take-over management of troubled banks to prevent collapse of the financial system. Based on IMF recommendation, the government increased interest rates to 70% pa in February 1998 to control spiralling inflation caused by higher price of imports, but this action killed availability of credit to the corporate sector. Suharto's foot-dragging in undertaking reforms demanded by IMF in relation to his children's business further weakened public confidence.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" /><ref name=\"Vickers 2005, pp. 203\u2013207\">Vickers (2005), pp. 203\u2013207.</ref> According to American economist [[Steve Hanke]], invited by Suharto in February 1998 to plan [[currency board]] system, President [[Bill Clinton]] and IMF managing director [[Michel Camdessus]] deliberately worsened the Indonesian crisis to force Suharto to resign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/fall-rupiah-suharto |title=On the Fall of the Rupiah and Suharto &#124; Cato Institute |publisher=Cato.org |date=27 January 2007 |accessdate=6 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nEconomic meltdown was accompanied by increasing political tension. Anti-Chinese riots occurred in [[Situbondo]] (1996), [[Tasikmalaya]] (1996), [[Banjarmasin]] (1997), and [[Makassar]] (1997); while bloody ethnic clashes broke out between the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] and [[Madurese people|Madurese]] settlers in [[Central Kalimantan]] in 1997. After violent campaign season, [[Golkar]] won the heavily rigged [[1997 Indonesian elections|May 1997 MPR elections]]. The new MPR voted unanimously to re-elect Suharto to another five-year term in office in March 1998, upon which he proceeded to appoint his protege [[BJ Habibie]] as vice-president while stacking the cabinet with his own family and business associates (his daughter [[Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana|Tutut]] became Minister of Social Affairs). Government's increase of fuel prices by 70% of 4 May triggered anti-Chinese rioting in [[Medan]]. With Suharto increasingly seen as the source of the country's mounting economic and political crises, prominent political figures spoke out against his presidency (notably Muslim politician [[Amien Rais]]), and in January 1998 university students began organising nationwide demonstrations.<ref>Elson (2001), p.267</ref>\n\nIn [[West Kalimantan]] there was communal violence between [[Dayak people|Dayaks]] and [[Madurese people|Madurese]] in 1996, in the [[Sambas conflict]] in 1999 and the [[Sampit conflict]] 2001, resulting in large-scale massacres of Madurese.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ploughshares.ca/libraries/ACRText/ACR-IndonesiaKalimantan.html|title=404 Error - Page Not Found|author=|date=|website=ploughshares.ca}}</ref><ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/dayak.htm Dayak]</ref><ref>[http://www.akademidayak.com/2008/06/relationship-between-dayak-and-madura.html THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DAYAK AND MADURA IN RETOK by Yohanes Supriyadi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324143522/http://www.akademidayak.com/2008/06/relationship-between-dayak-and-madura.html |date=24 March 2012 }}</ref> In the Sambas conflict, both [[Malay Indonesian|Malays]] and Dayaks massacred Madurese.\n\nThe crisis climaxed when Suharto was on a state visit to [[Egypt]] in May 1998. Security forces [[Trisakti shootings|killed four student demonstrators]] from Jakarta's [[Trisakti University]] on 12 May 1998, which was followed by [[Indonesian riots of May 1998|anti-Chinese rioting and looting across Jakarta and some other cities]] on 13\u201315 May that destroyed thousands of buildings and killed over 1,000 people. Various theories exist on the origins of the racial pogrom against the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic-Chinese]]. One theory suggested rivalry between military chief General [[Wiranto]] and [[Prabowo Subianto]], while another theory suggested deliberate provocation by Suharto to divert blame for the crisis to the ethnic-Chinese and discredit the student movement.<ref>Purdey (2006), p.148-150</ref>\n\nOn 16 May, tens of thousands of university students occupied the [[DPR/MPR Building|parliament building]], demanding Suharto's resignation. Upon Suharto's return to Jakarta, he tried to defend his presidency by offering to resign in 2003 and to reshuffle his cabinet. These efforts failed when his political allies deserted him by refusing to join the proposed new cabinet. According to military chief [[Wiranto]], on 18 May, Suharto issued a decree which provided authority to him to take any measures to restore security (similar to the 1966 [[Supersemar]]), however Wiranto decided not to enforce the decree to prevent conflict with the population.<ref>Wiranto (2003), p.67-69</ref> On 21 May 1998, Suharto announced his resignation, upon which vice-president [[B.

This involve formulating their diet to provide ideal nutrition and housing the cows in a confinement system such as free stall or tie stall. These cows are housed indoors throughout their lactation and may be put to pasture during their 60-day [[Dry cow|dry period]] before ideally calving again. Free stall style barns involve cattle loosely housed where they can have free access to feed, water, and stalls but are moved to another part of the barn to be milked multiple times a day. In a tie stall system, the milking units are brought to the cows during each milking. These cattle are tethered within their stalls with free access to water and feed are provided. In extensive systems, cattle are mainly outside on pasture for most of their lives. These cattle are generally lower in milk production and are herded multiple times daily to be milked. The systems used greatly depends on the climate and available land of the region of which the farm is situated.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nTo maintain [[lactation]], a dairy cow must be bred and produce calves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ciwf.com/farm-animals/cows/dairy-cows/|title=About dairy cows|website=www.ciwf.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref> Depending on market conditions, the cow may be bred with a \"dairy bull\" or a \"beef bull.\"  Female calves ([[:wikt:heifer|heifer]]s) with dairy breeding may be kept as replacement cows for the dairy herd.

Market calves are generally sold at two weeks of age and bull calves may fetch a premium over heifers due to their size, either current or potential.  Calves may be sold for [[veal]], or for one of several types of [[beef production]], depending on available local crops and markets. Such bull calves may be [[castration|castrated]] if turnout onto pastures is envisaged, to make them less aggressive. Purebred bulls from elite cows may be put into progeny testing schemes to find out whether they might become superior sires for breeding. Such animals can become extremely valuable.\n\nMost dairy farms separate calves from their mothers within a day of birth to reduce transmission of disease and simplify management of milking cows. Studies have been done allowing calves to remain with their mothers for 1, 4, 7 or 14 days after birth. Cows whose calves were removed longer than one day after birth showed increased searching, sniffing and vocalizations. However, calves allowed to remain with their mothers for longer periods showed weight gains at three times the rate of early removals as well as more searching behavior and better social relationships with other calves.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Effects of early separation on the dairy cow and calf: 2.

Milk replacer is an economical alternative to feeding whole milk because it is cheaper, can be bought at varying fat and protein percentages, and is typically less contaminated than whole milk when handled properly. Some farms pasteurize and feed calves milk from the cows in the herd instead of using replacer. A day-old calf consumes around 5 liters of milk per day.\n\nCattle are social animals; their ancestors tended to live in matriarchal groups of mothers and offspring. The formation of \"friendships\" between two cows is common and long lasting. Traditionally individual housing systems were used in calf rearing, to reduce the risk of disease spread and provide specific care. However, due to their social behaviour the grouping of offspring may be better for the calves' overall welfare. Social interaction between the calves can have a positive effect on their growth. It has been seen that calves housed in grouped penning were found to eat more feed than those in single pens,<ref>Overvest, Morgan, & Devries, Trevor. (2015). Effect of Feeding Strategy and Social Housing on Behaviour at Weaning in Dairy Calves.</ref> suggesting social facilitation of feeding behaviour in the calves. Play behaviour in pre-weaned dairy calves has also been suggested to help build social skills for later in life. It has been seen that those reared in grouped housing are more likely to become the dominant cattle in a new combination of animals.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Duve | first1 = Weary | last2 = Halekoh | first2 =  | last3 = Jensen | first3 =  | year = 2012 | title = The effects of social contact and milk allowance on responses to handling, play, and social behavior in young dairy calves | url = | journal = Journal of Dairy Science | volume = 95 | issue = 11| pages = 6571\u20136581 | doi = 10.3168/jds.2011-5170 }}</ref> These dominant animals have a priority choice of feed or lying areas and are generally stronger animals. Due to these reasons, it has become common practice to group or pair calves in their housing. It has become common within Canada to see paired or grouped housing in outdoor hutches or within an indoor pack penning.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n== Bull ==\nA bull calf with high genetic potential may be reared for breeding purposes.  It may be kept by a dairy farm as a herd bull, to provide natural breeding for the herd of cows.  A bull may service up to 50 or 60 cows during a breeding season.  Any more and the [[sperm count]] declines, leading to cows \"returning to service\" (to be bred again).  A herd bull may only stay for one season, as when most bulls reach over two years old their temperament becomes too unpredictable.\n\nBull calves intended for breeding commonly are bred on specialized dairy breeding farms, not production farms. These farms are the major source of stocks for [[artificial insemination]].\n\n{{see also|Sexing}}\n\n== Milk production levels ==\n[[File:Boskapssk\u00f6tsel i ladug\u00e5rden.

In theory a longevity of 10 lactations is possible.

Psychologists at the [[University of Leicester]], UK, analyzed the musical preference of milk cows and found out that music actually influences the dairy cow's lactation.

Artificial insemination uses estrus synchronization to indicate when the cow is going through ovulation and is susceptible to fertilization. Advantages of using AI include its low cost and ease compared to maintaining a bull, ability to select from a large number of bulls, elimination of diseases in the dairy industry, improved genetics and improved animal welfare <ref name=\"web.b.ebscohost.com\">{{cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=d13c04f9-4d35-42eb-aea4-2097bb7e6b4e@sessionmgr107&vid=1&hid=125|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate=29 January 2018}}</ref> Rather than a large bull jumping on a smaller heifer or weaker cow, AI allows the farmer to complete the breeding procedure within 5 minutes with minimum stress placed on the individual female's body.<ref name=\"web.b.ebscohost.com\"/>\n\nDairy cattle are polyestrous, meaning they cycle continuously throughout the year. They tend to be on a 21 day estrus cycle. However for management purposes, some operations use synthetic hormones to synchronize their cows or heifers to have them breed and calve at the ideal times. These hormones are short term and only used when necessary. For example, one common protocol for synchronization involves an injection of GnRH (gonadotrophin releasing hormone). which increases the levels of follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone in the body. Then, seven days later prostaglandin F2-alpha is injected, followed by another GnRH injection 48 hours later. This protocol causes the animal to ovulate 24 hours later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://extension.msstate.edu/sites/default/files/publications/publications/p2807.pdf|title=Estrus Synchronization of Dairy Cattle|access-date=28 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nEstrus is often called standing heat in cattle and refers to the time in their cycle where the female is receptive towards the male. Estrus behaviour can be detected by an experienced stockman. These behaviours can include standing to be mounted, mounting other cows, restlessness, decreased milk production, and decreased feed intake.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://extension.psu.edu/heat-detection-and-timing-of-insemination-for-cattle|title=Heat Detection and Timing of Insemination for Cattle}}</ref>\n\nMore recently, [[embryo transfer]] has been used to enable the multiplication of progeny from elite cows.  Such cows are given hormone treatments to produce multiple embryos. These are then 'flushed' from the cow's uterus. 7\u201312 [[embryo]]s are consequently removed from these donor cows and transferred into other cows who serve as [[surrogate mother]]s. This results in between three and six calves instead of the normal single or (rarely) twins.\n\n'''Bold text'''== Hormone use ==\nFarmers in some countries sometimes administer hormone treatments to dairy cows to increase milk production and reproduction.\n\nAbout 17% of dairy cows in the United States are injected with [[Bovine somatotropin]], also called recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST), recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH), or artificial growth hormone.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/ceah/ncahs/nahms/dairy/dairy07/Dairy2007_PartII.pdf |title=Dairy 2007 Part II: Changes in the U.S. Dairy Cattle Industry, 1991\u20132007 |date=March 2007 |publisher=Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service |accessdate=27 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113172353/http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/ceah/ncahs/nahms/dairy/dairy07/Dairy2007_PartII.pdf |archivedate=13 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The use of this hormone increases milk production by 11%\u201325%. The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has ruled that rBST is harmless to people. The use of rBST is banned in [[Canada]], parts of the [[European Union]], as well as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].\n\nIn Canada, Canadian Dairy farmers have high screening procedures they have to go through every time the milk is retrieved from the farm; if the regulations are not met the milk does not get loaded onto the truck for further processing. There is to be no medication<ref name=\"milkfacts.info\"/> or hormones {{citation needed|date=January 2019}} in the milk for safety reasons.\n\n== Nutrition ==\n[[File:DairyBarnOttawa.jpg|thumb|Dairy cattle at feeding time]]\nNutrition plays an important role in keeping cattle [[healthy]] and strong. Implementing an adequate nutrition program can also improve milk production and reproductive performance. [[Nutrient]] requirements may not be the same depending on the animal's age and stage of production. Diets are formulated to meet the dairy cow's energy and amino acid requirements for lactation, growth, and/or reproduction.<ref>{{https://extension.umn.edu/dairy-nutrition/formulating-dairy-cow-rations}} </ref>\n\nForages, which refer especially to anything grown in the field such as hay, straw, corn silage, or grass silage, are the most common type of feed used. The base of most lactating dairy cattle diets is high quality forage. [[Cereal grain]]s, as the main contributors of starch to diets, are important in helping to meet the [[energy]] needs of dairy cattle. [[Barley]]  is an excellent source of balanced amounts of [[protein]], [[energy]], and [[fiber]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/pubs/ansci/dairy/eb72w.htm| title=Feeding Barley to Dairy Cattle|date=|accessdate= 2 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nEnsuring adequate [[body fat]] reserves is essential for cattle to produce milk and also to keep reproductive efficiency. However, if cattle get excessively fat or too thin, they run the risk of developing metabolic problems and may have problems with calving.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://extension.missouri.edu/publications/DisplayPub.aspx?P=G3170| title=Feeding Dairy Cattle for Proper Body Condition Score|date=|accessdate= 2 June 2010}}</ref> [[Scientists]] have found that a variety of fat supplements can benefit conception rates of lactating dairy cows.

However, lack of knowledge of their nutritional and economic value limits their use. Although the reduction of costs may be significant, they have to be used carefully because animal may have negative reactions to radical changes in feeds, (e.g. [[fog fever]]). Such a change must then be made slowly and with the proper follow up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/pubs/ansci/dairy/as1180w.htm| title=By-Products and Regionally Available Alternative Feedstuffs for Dairy Cattle|date=|accessdate= 2 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Breeds ==\n{{See also|List of dairy cattle breeds}}\n\nAccording to the Purebred Dairy Cattle Association, PDCA, there are 7 major dairy breeds in the United States.

When they were first bred in this area, they were not known as Jerseys, but rather as the related Alderneys. The period between 1860 and around 1914 was a popular time for Jerseys. In this time span, many countries other than the United States started importing this breed, including Canada, South Africa, and New Zealand, among others.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Breeds \u2013 Jersey|url = http://www.thecattlesite.com/breeds/dairy/23/jersey/overview/|website = The Cattle Site|access-date = 9 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nAmong the smallest of the dairy breeds, the average Jersey cow matures at approximately {{convert|900|lb|-1|order=flip}}, with a typical weight range between {{convert|800|and(-)|1200|lb|-1|order=flip}}.

According to the American Jersey Cattle Association, Jerseys are found on 20 percent of all US dairy farms and are the primary breed in about 4 percent of dairies.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAmongst the ''Bos indicus'', the most popular dairy breed in the world is Sahiwal of the Indian subcontinent. It does not give as much milk as the Taurine breeds, but it is by far the most suitable breed for warmer climates. Australian Friesian Sahiwal and Australian Milking Zebu have been developed in Australia using Sahiwal genetics. Gir, another of the ''Bos indicus'' breeds, has been improved in Brazil for its milk production and is widely used there for dairy.\n\n== Animal welfare ==\n{{Animal rights sidebar}}\n[[Animal welfare]] refers to both the physical and mental state of an animal, and how it is coping with its situation. An animal is considered in a good state of welfare if it is able to express its innate behaviour, comfortable, healthy, safe, well nourished, and is not suffering from negative states such as distress, fear and pain. Good animal welfare requires disease prevention and veterinary treatment, appropriate shelter, management, nutrition, and humane handling. If the animal is slaughtered then it is no longer \"good animal welfare\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Cow Talk |url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/nid/20/pid/7274.htm |author1=Moran, John |author2=Doyle, Rebecca |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |year=2015 |isbn=9781486301614}}</ref> It is the human responsibility of the animals' wellbeing in all husbandry and management practices including humane euthanasia.\n\nProper animal handling, or stockmanship, is crucial to dairy animals' welfare as well as the safety of their handlers. Improper handling techniques can stress cattle leading to impaired production and health, such as increased slipping injuries. Additionally, the majority of nonfatal worker injuries on a dairy farm are from interactions with cattle. Dairy animals are handled on a daily basis for a wide variety of purposes including health-related management practices and movement from freestalls to the milking parlor. Due to the prevalence of human-animal interactions on dairy farms, researchers, veterinarians, and farmers alike have focused on furthering our understanding of stockmanship and educating agriculture workers. Stockmanship is a complex concept that involves the timing, positioning, speed, direction of movement, and sounds and touch of the handler.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nA recent survey of Minnesota dairy farms revealed that 42.6% of workers learned stockmanship techniques from family members, and 29.9% had participated in stockmanship training. However, as the growing U.S. dairy industry increasingly relies on an immigrant workforce, stockmanship training and education resources become more pertinent. Clearly communicating and managing a large culturally diverse workforce brings new challenges such as language barriers and time limitations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sorge|first1=US|author2=Cherry, C|author3=Bender JB|title=Perception of the Importance of Human-Animal Interactions on Cattle Flow and Worker Safety in Minnesota Dairy Farms|journal=Journal of Dairy Science|date=16 May 2014|volume=97|issue=7|pages=4632\u20134638|doi=10.3168/jds.2014-7971|pmid=24835968|url=http://umash.umn.edu/publications/product/perception-importance-human-animal-interactions-cattle-flow-worker-safety-mn-dairy/?|accessdate=5 August 2016}}</ref> \nOrganizations like the Upper Midwest Agriculture Safety and Health Center [http://www.umash.umn.edu (UMASH)] offer resources such as bilingual training videos, fact sheets, and informational posters for dairy worker training. Additionally the Beef Quality Assurance Program offer seminars, live demonstrations, and online resources for stockmanship training.\n\nFor cows to reach high performance in milk yields and reproduction, they must be in great condition and comfortable in the system. Once an individual\u2019s welfare is reduced, so does her efficiency and production. This creates more cost and time on the operation, therefore most farmers strive to create a healthy, hygienic, atmosphere for their cattle. As well as provide quality nutrition that keep the cows yield high.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fregonesi|display-authors=et al|date=2001|title=Behaviour, performance and health indicators of welfare for dairy cows housed in strawyard or cubicle systems|url=|journal=Livestock Science|volume=68:2|pages=205\u2013216|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe practice of dairy production has been criticized by [[animal rights]] activists. Some of the [[Ethics of eating meat|ethical reasons regarding dairy production]] cited include how often the dairy cattle are impregnated, the separation of calves from their mothers, and the fact that the cows are considered \"spent\" and culled at a relatively young age, as well as environmental concerns regarding dairy production.\n\nThe production of milk requires that the cow be in [[lactation]], which is a result of the cow having given birth to a calf. The cycle of insemination, pregnancy, parturition, and lactation is followed by a \"dry\" period of about two months before calving, which allows udder tissue to regenerate. A dry period that falls outside this time frames can result in decreased milk production in subsequent lactation.<ref>Invited Review: Bovine Studies on Optimal Lengths of Dry Periods.

This involve formulating their diet to provide ideal nutrition and housing the cows in a confinement system such as free stall or tie stall. These cows are housed indoors throughout their lactation and may be put to pasture during their 60-day [[Dry cow|dry period]] before ideally calving again. Free stall style barns involve cattle loosely housed where they can have free access to feed, water, and stalls but are moved to another part of the barn to be milked multiple times a day. In a tie stall system, the milking units are brought to the cows during each milking. These cattle are tethered within their stalls with free access to water and feed are provided. In extensive systems, cattle are mainly outside on pasture for most of their lives. These cattle are generally lower in milk production and are herded multiple times daily to be milked.

Market calves are generally sold at two weeks of age and bull calves may fetch a premium over heifers due to their size, either current or potential.  Calves may be sold for [[veal]], or for one of several types of [[beef production]], depending on available local crops and markets. Such bull calves may be [[castration|castrated]] if turnout onto pastures is envisaged, to make them less aggressive. Purebred bulls from elite cows may be put into progeny testing schemes to find out whether they might become superior sires for breeding. Such animals can become extremely valuable.\n\nMost dairy farms separate calves from their mothers within a day of birth to reduce transmission of disease and simplify management of milking cows. Studies have been done allowing calves to remain with their mothers for 1, 4, 7 or 14 days after birth. Cows whose calves were removed longer than one day after birth showed increased searching, sniffing and vocalizations. However, calves allowed to remain with their mothers for longer periods showed weight gains at three times the rate of early removals as well as more searching behavior and better social relationships with other calves.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Effects of early separation on the dairy cow and calf: 2.

Milk replacer is an economical alternative to feeding whole milk because it is cheaper, can be bought at varying fat and protein percentages, and is typically less contaminated than whole milk when handled properly. Some farms pasteurize and feed calves milk from the cows in the herd instead of using replacer. A day-old calf consumes around 5 liters of milk per day.\n\nCattle are social animals; their ancestors tended to live in matriarchal groups of mothers and offspring. The formation of \"friendships\" between two cows is common and long lasting. Traditionally individual housing systems were used in calf rearing, to reduce the risk of disease spread and provide specific care. However, due to their social behaviour the grouping of offspring may be better for the calves' overall welfare. Social interaction between the calves can have a positive effect on their growth. It has been seen that calves housed in grouped penning were found to eat more feed than those in single pens,<ref>Overvest, Morgan, & Devries, Trevor. (2015). Effect of Feeding Strategy and Social Housing on Behaviour at Weaning in Dairy Calves.</ref> suggesting social facilitation of feeding behaviour in the calves. Play behaviour in pre-weaned dairy calves has also been suggested to help build social skills for later in life. It has been seen that those reared in grouped housing are more likely to become the dominant cattle in a new combination of animals.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Duve | first1 = Weary | last2 = Halekoh | first2 =  | last3 = Jensen | first3 =  | year = 2012 | title = The effects of social contact and milk allowance on responses to handling, play, and social behavior in young dairy calves | url = | journal = Journal of Dairy Science | volume = 95 | issue = 11| pages = 6571\u20136581 | doi = 10.3168/jds.2011-5170 }}</ref> These dominant animals have a priority choice of feed or lying areas and are generally stronger animals.

It may be kept by a dairy farm as a herd bull, to provide natural breeding for the herd of cows.  A bull may service up to 50 or 60 cows during a breeding season.  Any more and the [[sperm count]] declines, leading to cows \"returning to service\" (to be bred again).  A herd bull may only stay for one season, as when most bulls reach over two years old their temperament becomes too unpredictable.\n\nBull calves intended for breeding commonly are bred on specialized dairy breeding farms, not production farms. These farms are the major source of stocks for [[artificial insemination]].\n\n{{see also|Sexing}}\n\n== Milk production levels ==\n[[File:Boskapssk\u00f6tsel i ladug\u00e5rden.

In theory a longevity of 10 lactations is possible. The chances of problems arising which may lead to a cow being culled are high, however; the average herd life of US Holstein is today fewer than 3 lactations. This requires more herd replacements to be reared or purchased. Over 90% of all cows are slaughtered for 4 main reasons:\n\n*'''Infertility''' \u2013 failure to conceive and reduced milk production.\n:Cows are at their most fertile between 60 and 80 days after calving. Cows remaining \"open\" (not with calf) after this period become increasingly difficult to breed, which may be due to poor health. Failure to expel the [[afterbirth]] from a previous pregnancy, luteal [[Ovarian cyst|cysts]], or [[metritis]], an infection of the uterus, are common causes of infertility.\n\n*'''[[Mastitis in dairy cattle|Mastitis]]''' \u2013 a persistent and potentially fatal mammary gland infection, leading to high [[somatic cell count]]s and loss of production.\n:Mastitis is recognized by a reddening and swelling of the infected quarter of the [[udder]] and the presence of whitish clots or pus in the milk.

This leads to [[laminitis]] and subsequent lameness, leaving the cow vulnerable to other foot infections and problems which may be exacerbated by standing in faeces or water soaked areas.\n\n*'''Production''' \u2013 some animals fail to produce economic levels of milk to justify their feed costs.\n:Production below 12 to 15{{nbsp}}L of milk per day is not economically viable.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nCow longevity is strongly correlated with production levels.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Knaus | year = 2009 | title = Dairy cows trapped between performance demands and adaptability | url = | journal = Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture | volume = 89 | issue = 7| pages = 1107\u20131114 | doi = 10.1002/jsfa.3575 }}</ref> Lower production cows live longer than high production cows, but may be less profitable.

Psychologists at the [[University of Leicester]], UK, analyzed the musical preference of milk cows and found out that music actually influences the dairy cow's lactation.

They tend to be on a 21 day estrus cycle. However for management purposes, some operations use synthetic hormones to synchronize their cows or heifers to have them breed and calve at the ideal times. These hormones are short term and only used when necessary. For example, one common protocol for synchronization involves an injection of GnRH (gonadotrophin releasing hormone). which increases the levels of follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone in the body. Then, seven days later prostaglandin F2-alpha is injected, followed by another GnRH injection 48 hours later. This protocol causes the animal to ovulate 24 hours later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://extension.msstate.edu/sites/default/files/publications/publications/p2807.pdf|title=Estrus Synchronization of Dairy Cattle|access-date=28 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nEstrus is often called standing heat in cattle and refers to the time in their cycle where the female is receptive towards the male. Estrus behaviour can be detected by an experienced stockman. These behaviours can include standing to be mounted, mounting other cows, restlessness, decreased milk production, and decreased feed intake.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://extension.psu.edu/heat-detection-and-timing-of-insemination-for-cattle|title=Heat Detection and Timing of Insemination for Cattle}}</ref>\n\nMore recently, [[embryo transfer]] has been used to enable the multiplication of progeny from elite cows.  Such cows are given hormone treatments to produce multiple embryos. These are then 'flushed' from the cow's uterus. 7\u201312 [[embryo]]s are consequently removed from these donor cows and transferred into other cows who serve as [[surrogate mother]]s. This results in between three and six calves instead of the normal single or (rarely) twins.\n\n== Hormone use ==\nFarmers in some countries sometimes administer hormone treatments to dairy cows to increase milk production and reproduction.\n\nAbout 17% of dairy cows in the United States are injected with [[Bovine somatotropin]], also called recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST), recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH), or artificial growth hormone.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/ceah/ncahs/nahms/dairy/dairy07/Dairy2007_PartII.pdf |title=Dairy 2007 Part II: Changes in the U.S. Dairy Cattle Industry, 1991\u20132007 |date=March 2007 |publisher=Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service |accessdate=27 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113172353/http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/ceah/ncahs/nahms/dairy/dairy07/Dairy2007_PartII.pdf |archivedate=13 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The use of this hormone increases milk production by 11%\u201325%. The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has ruled that rBST is harmless to people. The use of rBST is banned in [[Canada]], parts of the [[European Union]], as well as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].\n\nIn Canada, Canadian Dairy farmers have high screening procedures they have to go through every time the milk is retrieved from the farm; if the regulations are not met the milk does not get loaded onto the truck for further processing. There is to be no medication<ref name=\"milkfacts.info\"/> or hormones {{citation needed|date=January 2019}} in the milk for safety reasons.\n\n== Nutrition ==\n[[File:DairyBarnOttawa.jpg|thumb|Dairy cattle at feeding time]]\nNutrition plays an important role in keeping cattle [[healthy]] and strong. Implementing an adequate nutrition program can also improve milk production and reproductive performance. [[Nutrient]] requirements may not be the same depending on the animal's age and stage of production. Diets are formulated to meet the dairy cow's energy and amino acid requirements for lactation, growth, and/or reproduction.<ref>{{https://extension.umn.edu/dairy-nutrition/formulating-dairy-cow-rations}} </ref>\n\nForages, which refer especially to anything grown in the field such as hay, straw, corn silage, or grass silage, are the most common type of feed used. The base of most lactating dairy cattle diets is high quality forage. [[Cereal grain]]s, as the main contributors of starch to diets, are important in helping to meet the [[energy]] needs of dairy cattle. [[Barley]]  is an excellent source of balanced amounts of [[protein]], [[energy]], and [[fiber]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/pubs/ansci/dairy/eb72w.htm| title=Feeding Barley to Dairy Cattle|date=|accessdate= 2 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nEnsuring adequate [[body fat]] reserves is essential for cattle to produce milk and also to keep reproductive efficiency. However, if cattle get excessively fat or too thin, they run the risk of developing metabolic problems and may have problems with calving.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://extension.missouri.edu/publications/DisplayPub.aspx?P=G3170| title=Feeding Dairy Cattle for Proper Body Condition Score|date=|accessdate= 2 June 2010}}</ref> [[Scientists]] have found that a variety of fat supplements can benefit conception rates of lactating dairy cows. Some of these different fats include [[oleic acids]], found in [[canola oil]], animal tallow, and yellow grease; palmitic acid found in granular fats and dry fats; and linolenic acids which are found in [[cottonseed]], [[safflower]], [[sunflower]], and [[soybean]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extension.org/pages/Lipids_and_Longevity| title=Fats Defined|date=|accessdate= 2 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nUsing [[by-products]] is one way of reducing the normally high feed costs. However, lack of knowledge of their nutritional and economic value limits their use. Although the reduction of costs may be significant, they have to be used carefully because animal may have negative reactions to radical changes in feeds, (e.g. [[fog fever]]). Such a change must then be made slowly and with the proper follow up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/pubs/ansci/dairy/as1180w.htm| title=By-Products and Regionally Available Alternative Feedstuffs for Dairy Cattle|date=|accessdate= 2 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Breeds ==\n{{See also|List of dairy cattle breeds}}\n\nAccording to the Purebred Dairy Cattle Association, PDCA, there are 7 major dairy breeds in the United States.  These are: [[Holstein Friesian cattle|Holstein]], [[Brown Swiss]], [[Guernsey cattle|Guernsey]], [[Ayrshire cattle|Ayrshire]], [[Jersey cattle|Jersey]], [[Friesian Red and White|Red and White]], and [[Milking Shorthorn]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.purebreddairycattle.com/|title = Purebred Dairy Cattle Association|date = |accessdate = 17 September 2014|website = Purebred Dairy Cattle Association|publisher = Purebred Dairy Cattle Association|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nHolstein cows either have distinct white and black markings, or distinct red and white markings. Holstein cows are the biggest of all U.S. dairy breeds. A full mature Holstein cow usually weighs around {{convert|1500|lb|-2|order=flip}} and is {{convert|58|in|cm|0|order=flip}} tall at the shoulder. They are known for their outstanding milk production among the main breeds of dairy cattle. An average Holstein cow produces around {{convert|23000|lb|-3|order=flip}} of milk each lactation. Of the 9 million dairy cows in the U.S., approximately 90% of them are of the Holstein descent.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.holsteinusa.com/pdf/fact_sheet_cattle.pdf|title = Facts about Holstein Cattle|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = Holstein Association USA Inc.|last = |first = }}</ref> The top breed of dairy cow within Canada's national herd category is Holstein, taking up 93% of the dairy cow population, have a production rate of {{convert|10257|kg|0}} of milk per cow that contains 3.9% butter fat and 3.2% protein<ref name=\"dairyinfo.gc.ca\"/>\n\nBrown Swiss cows are widely accepted as the oldest dairy cattle breed, originally coming from a part of northeastern Switzerland. Some experts think that the modern Brown Swiss skeleton is similar to one found that looks to be from around the year 4000 BC Also, there is evidence that monks started breeding these cows about 1000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Breeds \u2013 Brown Swiss|url = http://www.thecattlesite.com/breeds/dairy/31/brown-swiss/overview/|website = The Cattle Site|access-date = 9 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Ayrshire breed first originated in the County of Ayr in Scotland. It became regarded as a well established breed in 1812. The different breeds that were crossed to form the Ayrshire are not exactly known. However, there is evidence that several breeds were crossed with the native cattle to create the breed.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Breeds \u2013 Ayrshire|url = http://www.thecattlesite.com/breeds/dairy/19/ayrshire/overview/|website = The Cattle Site|access-date = 9 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nGuernsey cows originated just off the coast of France on the small Isle of Guernsey. The breed was first known as a separate breed around 1700. Guernseys are known for their ability to produce very high quality milk from grass. Also, the term \"Golden Guernsey\" is very common as Guernsey cattle produce rich, yellow milk rather than the standard white milk other cow breeds produce.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Breeds \u2013 Guernsey|url = http://www.thecattlesite.com/breeds/dairy/21/guernsey/overview/|website = The Cattle Site|access-date = 9 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Jersey breed of dairy cow originated on a small island located off the coast of France called Jersey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/cattle/jersey|title=Breeds of Livestock \u2013 Jersey Cattle \u2014 Breeds of Livestock, Department of Animal Science|website=www.ansi.okstate.edu|accessdate=29 January 2018}}</ref> Despite being one of the oldest breeds of dairy cattle they now only occupy 4% of the Canadian National Herd.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://dairyinfo.gc.ca/index_e.php?s1=dff-fcil&s2=mrr-pcle&s3=mpb-plr|title=Average Milk Production by Breed (Milk Recording) \u2013 Canadian Dairy Information Centre (CDIC)|first=Government of Canada;Canadian Dairy Information|last=Centre|website=dairyinfo.gc.ca|accessdate=29 January 2018}}</ref> Purebred Jersey cows, according to available data, have been in the UK area since about the year 1741. When they were first bred in this area, they were not known as Jerseys, but rather as the related Alderneys. The period between 1860 and around 1914 was a popular time for Jerseys. In this time span, many countries other than the United States started importing this breed, including Canada, South Africa, and New Zealand, among others.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Breeds \u2013 Jersey|url = http://www.thecattlesite.com/breeds/dairy/23/jersey/overview/|website = The Cattle Site|access-date = 9 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nAmong the smallest of the dairy breeds, the average Jersey cow matures at approximately {{convert|900|lb|-1|order=flip}}, with a typical weight range between {{convert|800|and(-)|1200|lb|-1|order=flip}}. According to North Dakota State University, the fat content of the Jersey cow's milk is 4.9 percent. It is also the highest in protein, at 3.8 percent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://animals.mom.me/cows-highest-milk-fat-content-8041.html|title=Cows With the Highest Milk Fat Content|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> This high fat content means the milk is often used for making ice cream and cheeses. According to the American Jersey Cattle Association, Jerseys are found on 20 percent of all US dairy farms and are the primary breed in about 4 percent of dairies.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAmongst the ''Bos indicus'', the most popular dairy breed in the world is Sahiwal of the Indian subcontinent. It does not give as much milk as the Taurine breeds, but it is by far the most suitable breed for warmer climates. Australian Friesian Sahiwal and Australian Milking Zebu have been developed in Australia using Sahiwal genetics. Gir, another of the ''Bos indicus'' breeds, has been improved in Brazil for its milk production and is widely used there for dairy.\n\n== Animal welfare ==\n{{Animal rights sidebar}}\n[[Animal welfare]] refers to both the physical and mental state of an animal, and how it is coping with its situation. An animal is considered in a good state of welfare if it is able to express its innate behaviour, comfortable, healthy, safe, well nourished, and is not suffering from negative states such as distress, fear and pain. Good animal welfare requires disease prevention and veterinary treatment, appropriate shelter, management, nutrition, and humane handling. If the animal is slaughtered then it is no longer \"good animal welfare\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Cow Talk |url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/nid/20/pid/7274.htm |author1=Moran, John |author2=Doyle, Rebecca |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |year=2015 |isbn=9781486301614}}</ref> It is the human responsibility of the animals' wellbeing in all husbandry and management practices including humane euthanasia.\n\nProper animal handling, or stockmanship, is crucial to dairy animals' welfare as well as the safety of their handlers. Improper handling techniques can stress cattle leading to impaired production and health, such as increased slipping injuries. Additionally, the majority of nonfatal worker injuries on a dairy farm are from interactions with cattle. Dairy animals are handled on a daily basis for a wide variety of purposes including health-related management practices and movement from freestalls to the milking parlor. Due to the prevalence of human-animal interactions on dairy farms, researchers, veterinarians, and farmers alike have focused on furthering our understanding of stockmanship and educating agriculture workers. Stockmanship is a complex concept that involves the timing, positioning, speed, direction of movement, and sounds and touch of the handler.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nA recent survey of Minnesota dairy farms revealed that 42.6% of workers learned stockmanship techniques from family members, and 29.9% had participated in stockmanship training. However, as the growing U.S. dairy industry increasingly relies on an immigrant workforce, stockmanship training and education resources become more pertinent. Clearly communicating and managing a large culturally diverse workforce brings new challenges such as language barriers and time limitations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sorge|first1=US|author2=Cherry, C|author3=Bender JB|title=Perception of the Importance of Human-Animal Interactions on Cattle Flow and Worker Safety in Minnesota Dairy Farms|journal=Journal of Dairy Science|date=16 May 2014|volume=97|issue=7|pages=4632\u20134638|doi=10.3168/jds.2014-7971|pmid=24835968|url=http://umash.umn.edu/publications/product/perception-importance-human-animal-interactions-cattle-flow-worker-safety-mn-dairy/?|accessdate=5 August 2016}}</ref> \nOrganizations like the Upper Midwest Agriculture Safety and Health Center [http://www.umash.umn.edu (UMASH)] offer resources such as bilingual training videos, fact sheets, and informational posters for dairy worker training. Additionally the Beef Quality Assurance Program offer seminars, live demonstrations, and online resources for stockmanship training.\n\nFor cows to reach high performance in milk yields and reproduction, they must be in great condition and comfortable in the system. Once an individual\u2019s welfare is reduced, so does her efficiency and production. This creates more cost and time on the operation, therefore most farmers strive to create a healthy, hygienic, atmosphere for their cattle. As well as provide quality nutrition that keep the cows yield high.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fregonesi|display-authors=et al|date=2001|title=Behaviour, performance and health indicators of welfare for dairy cows housed in strawyard or cubicle systems|url=|journal=Livestock Science|volume=68:2|pages=205\u2013216|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe practice of dairy production has been criticized by [[animal rights]] activists. Some of the [[Ethics of eating meat|ethical reasons regarding dairy production]] cited include how often the dairy cattle are impregnated, the separation of calves from their mothers, and the fact that the cows are considered \"spent\" and culled at a relatively young age, as well as environmental concerns regarding dairy production.\n\nThe production of milk requires that the cow be in [[lactation]], which is a result of the cow having given birth to a calf. The cycle of insemination, pregnancy, parturition, and lactation is followed by a \"dry\" period of about two months before calving, which allows udder tissue to regenerate. A dry period that falls outside this time frames can result in decreased milk production in subsequent lactation.<ref>Invited Review: Bovine Studies on Optimal Lengths of Dry Periods. Bachman & Schairer. 2002. j Dairy Sci. 86:3027\u20133037.https://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(03)73902-2</ref>  Dairy operations therefore include both the production of milk and the production of calves. Bull calves are either castrated and raised as [[Cattle#Terminology|steers]] for beef production or used for veal.\n\nAnimal rights groups such as [[Mercy for Animals]] also raise welfare concerns by citing undercover footage showing abusive practices taking place in farms.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dairy's Dark Side: The Hidden Truth Behind Milk|url=http://www.mercyforanimals.org/dairy/|publisher=Mercy for Animals|accessdate=20 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Food}}\n* [[List of dairy cattle breeds|List of Dairy cattle breeds]]\n* [[Estrous synchronization]]\n* [[Fog fever]]\n* [[Dairy cattle showmanship]]\n* [[Meat industry]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2018}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dairy Cattle}}\n[[Category:Dairy farming]]\n[[Category:Cows]]\n", "name_user": "37.111.129.148", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eHormone use)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle"}
