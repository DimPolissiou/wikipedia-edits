Along with [[Isaac Alb\u00e9niz]], [[Francisco T\u00e1rrega]], and [[Enrique Granados]], he was one of Spain's most important musicians of the first half of the 20th century. He has a claim to being Spain's greatest composer of the 20th century, although the number of pieces he composed was relatively modest.\nHis image appeared on Spain's 1970 [[Spanish peseta|100-pesetas]] banknote.\n\n==Biography==\nFalla was born Manuel Mar\u00eda de los Dolores Falla y Matheu in [[Cadiz|C\u00e1diz]]. He was the son of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Falla, a Valencian, and Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Matheu, from Catalonia {{harv|Hess|2001a}}.\n\nIn 1889 he continued his piano lessons with Alejandro Odero and learned the techniques of [[harmony]] and [[counterpoint]] from Enrique Broca. At age 15 he became interested in literature and journalism and founded the literary magazines ''El Burl\u00f3n'' and ''El Cascabel''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Madrid===\n[[File:Calle de Serrano n\u00ba 72 (Madrid) 01.jpg|thumb|200px|Housing building where Falla lived in Madrid from 1901 to 1907]]\nBy 1900 he was living with his family in the capital, where he attended the Real Conservatorio de M\u00fasica y Declamaci\u00f3n. He studied piano with Jos\u00e9 Trag\u00f3, a colleague of [[Isaac Alb\u00e9niz]], and composition with [[Felipe Pedrell]]. In 1897 he composed ''Melod\u00eda'' for cello and piano and dedicated it to [[Salvador Viniegra]], who hosted evenings of [[chamber music]] that Falla attended. In 1899, by unanimous vote, he was awarded the first prize at the piano competition at his school of music. He premiered his first works: ''Romanza para violonchelo y piano'', ''Nocturno para piano'', ''Melod\u00eda para violonchelo y piano'', ''Serenata andaluza para viol\u00edn y piano'', and ''Cuarteto en Sol y Mireya''. That same year he started to use ''de'' with his first surname, making ''Manuel de Falla'' the name he became known as from that time on. When only the surname is used, however, the ''de'' is omitted.\n\nIn 1900 he composed his ''Canci\u00f3n para piano'' and various other vocal and piano pieces. He premiered his ''Serenata andaluza y Vals-Capricho para piano'' in the [[Ateneo de Madrid]]. Due to the precarious financial position of his family, he began to teach piano classes.\n\nIt was from Pedrell, during the Madrid period, that Falla became interested in the music of his native [[Andalusia]], particularly Andalusian [[flamenco]] (specifically ''[[cante jondo]]''), the influence of which can be strongly felt in many of his works {{harv|Mercurio|2014|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}<!--It does not take an entire 15-page article to establish this simple statement.-->}}. Among his early pieces are a number of [[zarzuela]]s like ''La Juana y la Petra'' and ''La casa de t\u00f3came Roque''. On 12 April 1902 he premiered ''Los amores de la In\u00e9s'' in the Teatro C\u00f3mico de Madrid. The same year he met the composer [[Joaqu\u00edn Turina]] and saw his ''Vals-Capricho'' y ''Serenata andaluza'' published by the Society of Authors.\n\nThe following year he composed and performed ''Allegro de concierto'' for the [[Madrid Royal Conservatory]] competition. [[Enrique Granados]] took first prize with his composition of the same title, but the Society of Authors published Falla's works ''Tus ojillos negros'' and ''Nocturno''. Falla then began his collaboration with composer [[Amadeo Vives]] on the zarzuelas ''Prisionero de guerra'', ''El cornet\u00edn de \u00f3rdenes'' and ''La cruz de Malta'' (only fragments of these works survive).\n\nHis first important work was the one-act [[opera]] ''[[La vida breve]]'' (''Life is Short'', or ''The Brief Life'', written in 1905, though revised before its premiere in 1913). With a libretto by [[Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez Shaw]], ''La vida breve'' won Falla first prize in the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]] musical competition, with a prize of 2500 pesetas and a promise of a production at the [[Teatro Real|Teatro Royal]] in Madrid\u2014a pledge which unfortunately was not fulfilled {{harv|Harper|1998|loc=17}}.  In April 1905 he won the first prize in a piano competition sponsored by the firm of Ortiz and Cuss\u00f3. On 15 May his work ''Allegro de concierto'' premiered at the Ateneo de Madrid and on 13 November the Real Academia presented him with his prize for ''La vida breve''.\n\n===Paris===\nFalla moved to Paris in 1907, where he remained for seven years. There he met a number of composers who had an influence on his style, including  [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Paul Dukas]], as well as [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Florent Schmitt]], [[Isaac Alb\u00e9niz]] and the impresario [[Sergei Diaghilev]] {{harv|Hess|2001a}}. In 1908 [[King Alfonso XIII]] awarded him a royal grant that enabled him to remain in Paris while he finished his ''Cuatro piezas espa\u00f1olas''. In 1910 Falla met Stravinsky and in 1911\u201312 traveled to London, Brussels and Milan to give concerts and investigate possible venues for ''La vida breve'', which he had composed shortly after his arrival in Paris in 1907 but which, despite the support of Dukas and Falla's own best efforts, was not finally performed until 1 April 1913 at the Municipal Casino in [[Nice]], with the libretto translated into French by the dramatist [[Paul Milliet]]. A second production was given the following year at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, to acclaim from critics such as [[Pierre Lalo]] and Andr\u00e9 Coeuroy {{harv|Hess|2001a}}. He wrote ''Siete canciones populares espa\u00f1olas'', which he finished in mid-1914. Shortly after, [[World War I]] began, forcing Falla to return to Madrid {{harv|Hess|2001a}}. While at no stage was he a prolific composer, it was then that he entered into his mature creative period.\n\n===Return to Madrid===\nIn Madrid he composed several of his best-known pieces, including:\n* The [[nocturne]] for piano and orchestra ''[[Noches en los jardines de Espa\u00f1a]]'' (1916)\n* The [[ballet (music)|ballet]] ''[[El amor brujo]]'' (1915) which includes the much excerpted and arranged ''[[Danza ritual del fuego]]''\n* The ballet ''The Magistrate and the Miller's Wife'' (''El corregidor y la molinera'') which, after revision, became ''[[El sombrero de tres picos]]'' (1917) and was produced by [[Sergei Diaghilev|Serge Diaghilev]] with set design and costumes by [[Pablo Picasso]]. It derives from ''[[The Three-Cornered Hat (novel)|The Three-Cornered Hat]]'' (1874), a novel written by [[Pedro Antonio de Alarc\u00f3n]] {{harv|Bedmar Estrada|n.d.}}.\n\n===Granada period===\n[[File:Manuel de Falla con bast\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|150px|Manuel de Falla with walking stick (date unknown)]]\nFrom 1921 to 1939 Manuel de Falla lived in [[Granada]], where he organized the [[Concurso de Cante Jondo]] in 1922. In Granada he wrote the puppet opera ''[[El retablo de maese Pedro]]'' (''Master Peter's Puppet Show'', 1923) and a [[concerto]] for [[harpsichord]] and [[chamber music|chamber]] ensemble (''[[Harpsichord Concerto (De Falla)|Harpsichord Concerto]]'', 1926). The puppet opera marked the first time Falla included the harpsichord in  his orchestra. Both of these works were written with [[Wanda Landowska]] in mind. In these works, the Spanish folk influence is somewhat less apparent than a kind of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinskian]] [[neoclassicism]] ({{harvnb|Hess|2001a}}; {{harvnb|Hess|2001b|loc=234, 239}}; {{harvnb|Hess|2004|loc=139, 146, 151}}).\n\nAlso in Granada, Falla began work on the large-scale orchestral cantata ''[[Atl\u00e1ntida (opera)|Atl\u00e1ntida]]'' (''Atlantis''), based on the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] text ''[[L'Atl\u00e0ntida]]'' by [[Jacint Verdaguer]].\n\n===Argentina===\nFalla continued work on ''Atl\u00e1ntida'' after moving to [[Argentina]] in 1939, following [[Francisco Franco]]'s victory in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. (The orchestration of the piece remained incomplete at his death and was completed posthumously by [[Ernesto Halffter]].) He also premiered his ''Suite Homenajes'' in [[Buenos Aires]] in November 1939. In 1940, he was named a Knight of the Order of King [[Alfonso X of Castile]]. Franco's government offered him a large pension if he would return to Spain, but he refused.\n\nFalla did spend some time teaching in exile. Among his notable pupils was composer [[Rosa Garc\u00eda Ascot]]. His health began to decline and he moved to a house in the mountains where he was tended by his sister Mar\u00eda del Carmen de Falla (1882\u20131971). He died of [[cardiac arrest]] on 14 November 1946 in [[Alta Gracia]], in the Argentine province of [[C\u00f3rdoba Province (Argentina)|C\u00f3rdoba]]. He had left in writing that he wanted to be buried in the Sierras de C\u00f3rdoba in Argentina. The Spanish Embassy of Francisco Franco decided to bring him back to Spain.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} In 1947 his remains were brought back to Spain and entombed in the cathedral at C\u00e1diz. One of the lasting honors to his memory is the Manuel de Falla Chair of Music in the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters at [[Complutense University of Madrid]]. His image appeared on Spanish currency notes for some years. Manuel de Falla never married and had no children.{{Citation needed|ydate=May 2016|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Works===\n{{For|listings of Falla's compositions|List of compositions by Manuel de Falla|List of works for the stage by Manuel de Falla}}\n\n== Honours ==\n* '''1935''': Associate of the [[Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium]] ({{harvnb|Anon.|n.d.}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|[2006]|loc=73}}).\n* '''1940''': Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of Alfonso X the Wise]].\n* Member of the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]]\n* Member of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Angustias.\n\n== Legacy ==\nFalla's house in Granada is preserved as a biographical museum {{harv|Anon.|n.d.}}.\n\n=== Recordings by Falla ===\n*Manuel de Falla 1876\u20131946 Grabaciones hist\u00f3ricas; [[Centro de Documentaci\u00f3n Musical de Andaluc\u00eda]].

In these works, the Spanish folk influence is somewhat less apparent than a kind of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinskian]] [[neoclassicism]] ({{harvnb|Hess|2001a}}; {{harvnb|Hess|2001b|loc=234, 239}}; {{harvnb|Hess|2004|loc=139, 146, 151}}).\n\nAlso in Granada, Falla began work on the large-scale orchestral cantata ''[[Atl\u00e1ntida (opera)|Atl\u00e1ntida]]'' (''Atlantis''), based on the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] text ''[[L'Atl\u00e0ntida]]'' by [[Jacint Verdaguer]].\n\n===Argentina===\nFalla continued work on ''Atl\u00e1ntida'' after moving to [[Argentina]] in 1939, following [[Francisco Franco]]'s victory in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. (The orchestration of the piece remained incomplete at his death and was completed posthumously by [[Ernesto Halffter]].) He also premiered his ''Suite Homenajes'' in [[Buenos Aires]] in November 1939. In 1940, he was named a Knight of the Order of King [[Alfonso X of Castile]]. Franco's government offered him a large pension if he would return to Spain, but he refused.\n\nFalla did spend some time teaching in exile. Among his notable pupils was composer [[Rosa Garc\u00eda Ascot]]. His health began to decline and he moved to a house in the mountains where he was tended by his sister Mar\u00eda del Carmen de Falla (1882\u20131971). He died of [[cardiac arrest]] on 14 November 1946 in [[Alta Gracia]], in the Argentine province of [[C\u00f3rdoba Province (Argentina)|C\u00f3rdoba]]. He had left in writing that he wanted to be buried in the Sierras de C\u00f3rdoba in Argentina. The Spanish Embassy of Francisco Franco decided to bring him back to Spain.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} In 1947 his remains were brought back to Spain and entombed in the cathedral at C\u00e1diz. One of the lasting honors to his memory is the Manuel de Falla Chair of Music in the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters at [[Complutense University of Madrid]]. His image appeared on Spanish currency notes for some years. Manuel de Falla never married and had no children.{{Citation needed|ydate=May 2016|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Works===\n{{For|listings of Falla's compositions|List of compositions by Manuel de Falla|List of works for the stage by Manuel de Falla}}\n\n== Honours ==\n* '''1935''': Associate of the [[Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium]] ({{harvnb|Anon.|n.d.}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|[2006]|loc=73}}).\n* '''1940''': Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of Alfonso X the Wise]].\n* Member of the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]]\n* Member of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Angustias.\n\n== Legacy ==\nFalla's house in Granada is preserved as a biographical museum {{harv|Anon.|n.d.}}.\n\n=== Recordings by Falla ===\n*Manuel de Falla 1876\u20131946 Grabaciones hist\u00f3ricas; [[Centro de Documentaci\u00f3n Musical de Andaluc\u00eda]].

A group of reformers, united around the young Ivan and known as the \"Chosen Council\", declared him Tsar (Emperor) of [[Kievan Rus'|All Rus']] in 1547 at the age of sixteen, establishing the [[Tsardom of Russia]] with Moscow as the predominant state. Ivan's reign was characterized by Russia's transformation from a [[medieval]] state into an [[empire]] under the Tsar, though at immense cost to its people and its broader, long-term economy. In the young years of Ivan, there was a conquest of the [[Khanate]]s of [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Khanate of Astrakhan|Astrakhan]]. After consolidating his power, Ivan got rid of the advisers from the \"Chosen Council\" and triggered the [[Livonian War]], which ravaged Russia and resulted in the loss of [[Livonia]] and [[Ingria]], but allowed him to establish greater [[Autocracy|autocratic control]] over [[Russian nobility|Russia's nobility]], whom he violently purged in the ''[[Oprichnina]]''. The later years of Ivan's reign were also marked by the [[Massacre of Novgorod]] and the [[Russo-Crimean Wars#Russo\u2013Crimean War (1570\u20131572)|burning of Moscow by Tatars]].  Ivan was a patron of [[trade]], giving a monopoly to the [[Muscovy Company]], and the founder of Russia's first [[publishing house]], the [[Moscow Print Yard]].\n\nHistoric sources present disparate accounts of Ivan's complex personality: he was described as intelligent and devout, but also prone to [[paranoia]], [[Rage (emotion)|rages]], and episodic outbreaks of [[mental instability]] that increased with age.<ref>Shvidkovski\u012d, Dmitri\u012d Olegovich (2007) ''Russian Architecture and the West''.

He was the first to be crowned as \"Tsar of All the Russias\", imitating in part his grandfather, [[Ivan III the Great]], who had title Grand Prince of all Rus'. Prior to that, rulers of [[Muscovy]] were crowned as Grand Princes, although [[Ivan III the Great]],  styled himself \"[[tsar]]\" in his correspondence. Two weeks after his coronation, Ivan married his first wife [[Anastasia Romanovna]], a member of the [[Romanov family]], who became the first Russian [[tsaritsa]].\n\nBy being crowned Tsar, Ivan was sending a message to the world and to Russia: he was now the only supreme ruler of the country, and his will was not to be questioned. \"The new title symbolized an assumption of powers equivalent and parallel to those held by former Byzantine Emperor and the Tatar Khan, both known in Russian sources as Tsar. The political effect was to elevate Ivan's position.\"<ref>[[#Martin|Martin]], p. 377</ref> The new title not only secured the throne, but it also granted Ivan a new dimension of power, one intimately tied to religion.

He introduced local self-government to rural regions, mainly in the northeast of Russia, populated by the state peasantry.\n\nBy Ivan's order in 1553 the [[Moscow Print Yard]] was established and the first [[printing press]] was introduced to Russia. Several religious books in Russian were printed during the 1550s and 1560s. The new technology provoked discontent among traditional scribes, leading to the Print Yard being burned in an arson attack. The first Russian printers, [[Ivan Fedorov (printer)|Ivan Fedorov]] and [[Pyotr Mstislavets]], were forced to flee from Moscow to the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Nevertheless, printing of books resumed from 1568 onwards, with Andronik Timofeevich Nevezha and his son Ivan now heading the Print Yard.\n\nIvan had [[St. Basil's Cathedral]] constructed in Moscow to commemorate the seizure of [[Kazan]]. There is a false legend that he was so impressed with the structure that he had the architect, [[Postnik Yakovlev]], blinded so that he could never design anything as beautiful again. In reality, Postnik Yakovlev went on to design more churches for Ivan and the walls of the [[Kazan Kremlin]] in the early 1560s, as well as the chapel over St. Basil's grave that was added to St. Basil's Cathedral in 1588, several years after Ivan's death. Although more than one architect was associated with this name and constructions, it is believed that the principal architect is one and the same person.<ref>[https://slovar.cc/enc/bse/2031865.html \u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a].

While on his presumed deathbed, Ivan had asked the boyars to swear an oath of allegiance to his eldest son, an infant at the time. Many boyars refused, deeming the Tsar's health too hopeless for him to survive. This angered Ivan and added to his distrust of the boyars. There followed brutal reprisals and assassinations, including those of [[Metropolitan Philip]] and Prince [[Alexander Gorbatyi-Shuisky]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} -->\n\n===Oprichnina===\n{{Main|Oprichnina}}\n\nThe 1560s brought to Russia hardships that led to a dramatic change of Ivan's policies. Russia was devastated by a combination of drought and famine, unsuccessful wars against the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Tatar invasions]] and the sea-trading blockade carried out by the Swedes, Poles and the [[Hanseatic League]]. His first wife, [[Anastasia Romanovna]], died in 1560, and her death was suspected to be a poisoning. This personal tragedy deeply hurt Ivan and it is thought to have affected his personality, if not his mental health. At the same time, one of Ivan's advisors, Prince [[Andrei Kurbsky]], defected to the Lithuanians, took command of the Lithuanian troops and devastated the Russian region of [[Velikiye Luki]]. This series of treasons made Ivan paranoically suspicious of nobility.\n\n[[File:0NevrevNV Oprichniki BISH.jpg|thumb|300px|left|''The Oprichniki'' by [[Nikolai Nevrev]].

From there he sent two letters in which he announced his [[abdication]] because of the alleged embezzlement and treason of the aristocracy and clergy. The [[boyar]] court was unable to rule in Ivan's absence and feared the wrath of the Muscovite citizenry. A boyar envoy departed for Aleksandrova Sloboda to beg Ivan to return to the throne.<ref>[[#Madariaga|Madariaga]], pp. 176\u2013178</ref><ref name=\"Pavlov\">Pavlov, Andrei and Perrie, Maureen (2003) ''Ivan the Terrible (Profiles in Power)''.

He demanded that he should be able to execute and confiscate the estates of traitors without interference from the boyar council or church. Upon this, Ivan decreed the creation of the oprichnina.<ref>[[#Madariaga|Madariaga]], pp. 179\u201380</ref>\n\nThe oprichnina consisted of a separate territory within the borders of Russia, mostly in the territory of the former [[Novgorod Republic]] in the north. Ivan held exclusive power over the oprichnina territory. The Boyar Council ruled the zemshchina ('land'), the second division of the state. Ivan also recruited a personal guard known as the [[Oprichniki]]. Originally it was a thousand strong.<ref name=Pavlov/><ref>[[#Madariaga|Madariaga]], pp. 182\u2013183</ref> The oprichniki were headed by [[Malyuta Skuratov]]. One known oprichnik was the German adventurer [[Heinrich von Staden (author)|Heinrich von Staden]]. The oprichniki enjoyed social and economic privileges under the oprichnina. They owed their allegiance and status to Ivan, not to heredity or local bonds.<ref name=Pavlov/>\n\nThe first wave of persecutions targeted primarily the princely clans of Russia, notably the influential families of Suzdal. Ivan executed, exiled or forcibly [[tonsure]]d prominent members of the boyar clans on questionable accusations of conspiracy. Among those executed were the [[Metropolitan Philip]] and the prominent warlord [[Alexander Gorbaty-Shuisky]]. In 1566 Ivan extended the oprichnina to eight central districts. Of the 12,000 nobles there, 570 became oprichniks, and the rest were expelled.<ref>[[#Madariaga|Madariaga]], p. 183; as the tonsure was the distinctive hairstyle of monastic orders, a forcibly \"tonsured\" boyar was effectively exiled from power by being made to enter a monastic life.</ref>\n\nUnder the new political system, the Oprichniki were given large estates, but unlike the previous landlords, could not be held accountable for their actions. These men \"took virtually all the peasants possessed, forcing them to pay 'in one year as much as [they] used to pay in ten.{{' \"}}<ref>[[#Martin|Martin]], p. 410</ref> This degree of oppression resulted in increasing cases of peasants fleeing, which in turn led to a drop in the overall production. The price of grain increased by a factor of ten.\n\n===Sack of Novgorod===\n{{Main|Massacre of Novgorod}}\n\nConditions under the Oprichnina were worsened by the 1570 epidemic, a plague that killed 10,000 people in Novgorod, and 600\u20131,000 daily in Moscow. During the grim conditions of the epidemic, and a famine along with the ongoing [[Livonian War]], Ivan grew suspicious that noblemen of the wealthy city of Novgorod were planning to defect, placing the city itself into the control of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. A Novgorod citizen Petr Volynets warned the tsar about the alleged conspiracy (though modern historians believe that his report was false). In 1570 Ivan ordered the Oprichniki to raid the city. The Oprichniki burned and pillaged Novgorod and the surrounding villages, and the city was never to regain its former prominence.<ref name=\"Novgorod1911\">{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Novgorod (town) |display=Novgorod |volume=19 |pages=839\u2013840 |first1=Peter |last1=Kropotkin |first2=John Thomas |last2=Bealby}}</ref>\n\nCasualty figures vary greatly from different sources.

During the [[Russo-Crimean War (1571)|1571\u201372 Russo-Crimean war]], oprichniks failed to prove themselves worthy against a regular army. In 1572, Ivan abolished the Oprichnina and disbanded his oprichniks.\n\n===Pretended resignation===\nIn 1575, Ivan once again pretended to resign from his title and proclaimed [[Simeon Bekbulatovich]], his statesman of Tatar origin, the new Tsar. Simeon reigned as a figurehead leader for a year. According to English envoy [[Giles Fletcher, the Elder]], under Ivan's instructions Simeon confiscated all of the lands that belonged to monasteries, while Ivan pretended to disagree with the decision. When the throne was returned to Ivan in 1576, he returned some of the confiscated land, keeping the rest.\n\n==Foreign policy==\n\n===Diplomacy and trade===\n[[File:Ivan the Terrible and Harsey.jpg|thumb|300px|''Ivan the Terrible Showing His Treasures to [[Jerome Horsey]]'' by [[Alexander Litovchenko]] (1875)]]\n\nIn 1547, Hans Schlitte, the agent of Ivan, recruited craftsmen in Germany for work in Russia. However, all these craftsmen were arrested in [[L\u00fcbeck]] at the request of Poland and [[Livonia]]. The German merchant companies ignored the new [[Ivangorod|port built by Ivan]] on the [[Narva River|River Narva]] in 1550 and continued to deliver goods in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] ports owned by Livonia. Russia remained isolated from sea trade.\n\nIvan established close ties with the [[Kingdom of England]]. Russo-English relations can be traced to 1551, when the [[Muscovy Company]] was formed by [[Richard Chancellor]], [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]], Sir [[Hugh Willoughby]] and several London merchants. In 1553, [[Richard Chancellor]] sailed to the [[White Sea]] and continued overland to Moscow, where he visited Ivan's court. Ivan opened up the White Sea and the port of [[Arkhangelsk]] to the Company and granted the Company privilege of trading throughout his reign without paying the standard customs fees.<ref>[[#Martin|Martin]], p. 407.</ref> Muscovy Company retained the monopoly in Russo-English trade until 1698.\n\nWith the use of English merchants, Ivan engaged in a long correspondence with [[Elizabeth I of England]]. While the queen focused on commerce, Ivan was more interested in a military alliance. During his troubled relations with the boyars, the tsar even asked her for a guarantee to be granted asylum in England should his rule be jeopardized. Elizabeth agreed on condition that he provided for himself during his stay.<ref>{{cite news|title=Russians in London: Government in exile|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21692934-new-generation-migr-s-has-plans-homeland-they-never-wanted-flee-government|accessdate=12 February 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=12 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nIvan IV corresponded with overseas Orthodox leaders. In response to a letter of [[Patriarch Joachim of Alexandria]] asking the Tsar for financial assistance for the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai Peninsula]], which had suffered from the Turks, Ivan IV sent in 1558 a delegation to [[Egypt Eyalet]]  by archdeacon Gennady, who, however, died in [[Constantinople]] before he could reach Egypt. From then on the embassy was headed by [[Smolensk]] merchant Vasily Poznyakov.

In 1521 the combined forces of Khan [[Mehmed I Giray|Mehmed Giray]] and his Crimean allies attacked Russia, captured more than 150,000 slaves ''The Full Collection of the Russian Annals'', vol.13, SPb, 1904</ref> In the 1530s the Crimean khan formed an offensive alliance with [[Safa Giray of Kazan]], his relative. When Safa Giray invaded [[Muscovy]] in December 1540, the Russians used [[Qasim Tatars]] to contain him. After his advance was stalled near Murom, Safa Giray was forced to withdraw to his own borders.\n\nThese reverses undermined Safa Giray's authority in Kazan. A pro-Russian party, represented by [[Shahgali]], gained enough popular support to make several attempts to take over the Kazan throne. In 1545 Ivan IV mounted an expedition to the [[River Volga]] to show his support for pro-Russian factions.\n\nIn 1551 the tsar sent his envoy to the [[Nogai Horde]] and they promised to maintain neutrality during the impending war. The [[Ar begs]] and [[Udmurts]] submitted to Russian authority as well. In 1551 the wooden fort of [[Sviyazhsk]] was transported down the Volga from [[Uglich]] all the way to Kazan. It was used as the Russian ''place d'armes'' during the decisive campaign of 1552.\n\nOn 16 June 1552 Ivan IV led a strong Russian army towards Kazan. The last siege of the Tatar capital commenced on 30 August. Under the supervision of Prince [[Alexander Gorbaty-Shuisky]], the Russians used [[battering ram]]s and a [[siege tower]], [[Mining (military)|undermining]] and 150 cannons. The Russians also had the advantage of efficient [[military engineer]]s. The city's water supply was blocked and the walls were breached. Kazan finally fell on 2 October, its fortifications were razed, and much of the population massacred. Many Russian prisoners and slaves were released. The Tsar celebrated his victory over Kazan by building several churches with oriental features, most famously [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] on [[Red Square]] in Moscow. The fall of Kazan was only the beginning of a series of so-called \"Cheremis wars\". The attempts of the Moscow government to gain a foothold on the Middle Volga over and over again provoked uprisings of local peoples, which it was possible to suppress only with great difficulty. In 1557, the [[Kazan rebellion of 1552\u20131556|First Cheremis War]] ended and also the [[Bashkirs]] accepted Ivan IV's authority.\n\nIn two campaigns of 1554 and 1556, Russian troops conquered the [[Astrakhan Khanate]] at the base of the Volga River, and the new [[Astrakhan]] fortress was built in 1558 by [[Ivan Vyrodkov]] instead of the old Tatar capital. The annexation of the Tatar khanates meant the conquest of vast territories, access to large markets and control of the entire length of the Volga River.

The results presaged the many disasters to come. A plan to unite the Volga and Don by a canal was detailed in [[Constantinople]]. In the summer of 1569 a large force under Kasim Pa\u015fa of 1,500 [[Janissaries]], 2,000 Spakhs, and few thousand [[Azap]]s and [[Ak\u0131nc\u0131s]] were sent to lay siege to [[Astrakhan]] and begin the canal works, while an Ottoman fleet besieged [[Azov]].\n\nEarly in 1570, Ivan's ambassadors concluded a treaty at Constantinople that restored friendly relations between the Sultan and the Tsar.\n\n===Livonian War===\n{{Main|Livonian War}}\n{{Expand section|date=January 2012}}\n[[File:Ivan IV Ortelius 1574.JPG|thumb|''Ioannes Basilius Magnus Imperator Russiae, Dux Moscoviae'', by [[Abraham Ortelius]] (1574)]]\n\nIn 1558, Ivan launched the [[Livonian War]] in an attempt to gain access to the [[Baltic Sea]] and its major trade routes. The war ultimately proved unsuccessful, stretching on for 24 years and engaging the [[History of Sweden (1523\u20131611)|Kingdom of Sweden]], the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and the [[Teutonic Knights]] of [[Livonia]]. The prolonged war had nearly destroyed the economy, while the ''Oprichnina'' had thoroughly disrupted the government. Meanwhile, the [[Union of Lublin]] had united the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]], and the Commonwealth acquired an energetic leader, [[Stefan Batory]], who was supported by Russia's southern enemy, the Ottoman Empire. Ivan's realm was being squeezed by two of the great powers of the time.\n\nAfter rejected peace proposals from his enemies, Ivan IV found himself in a difficult position by 1579. The displaced refugees fleeing the war compounded the effects of the simultaneous drought, and exacerbated war engendered epidemics, causing much loss of life.\n\nBatory then launched a series of offensives against Muscovy in the campaign seasons of 1579\u201381, trying to cut the [[Kingdom of Livonia]] from Muscovite territories. During his first offensive in 1579, he retook [[Polotsk]] with 22,000 men. During the second, in 1580, he took [[Velikie Luki]] with a 29,000-strong force. Finally, he began the [[Siege of Pskov]] in 1581 with a 100,000-strong army. [[Narva]] in [[Estonia]] was reconquered by Sweden in 1581.\n\nUnlike Sweden and Poland, Denmark under [[Frederick II of Denmark and Norway|Frederick II]] had trouble continuing the fight against Muscovy. He came to an agreement with [[John III of Sweden]], in 1580, transferring the Danish titles of Livonia to John III. Muscovy recognized Polish\u2013Lithuanian control of Livonia only in 1582. After [[Magnus von Lyffland]], brother of Fredrick II and former ally of Ivan, died in 1583, Poland invaded his territories in the [[Duchy of Courland]], and Frederick II decided to sell his rights of inheritance. Except for the island of [[Saaremaa]], Denmark was out of the Livonia by 1585.\n\n===Crimean raids===\n{{Main|Russo-Crimean Wars|Crimean-Nogai raids into East Slavic lands}}\n[[File:Ivans ivory throne.jpg|thumb|Ivan's throne (ivory, metal, wood)]]\n\nIn the later years of Ivan's reign, the southern borders of Muscovy were disturbed by Crimean Tatars.

Khan [[Devlet I Giray]] of Crimea repeatedly raided the Moscow region. In 1571, the 40,000-strong Crimean and Turkish army launched a large-scale raid. Due to the ongoing Livonian War, Moscow's garrison was as small as 6,000, and could not even delay the Tatar approach. Unresisted, Devlet devastated unprotected towns and villages around Moscow and caused the [[Fire of Moscow (1571)|1571 Fire of Moscow]]. Historians estimate the number of casualties of the fire from 10,000 to as many 80,000 people.\n\nTo buy peace from Devlet Giray, Ivan was forced to relinquish his claims on [[Astrakhan]] in favor of the Crimean Khanate (although this proposed transfer was only a diplomatic maneuver and was never actually completed). This defeat angered Ivan. Between 1571 and 1572, preparations were made upon his orders. In addition to [[Zasechnaya cherta]], innovative fortifications were set beyond the [[Oka River|River Oka]] that defined the border.\n\nThe following year, Devlet launched another raid on Moscow, now with a numerous horde,<ref>120,000-strong, according to Russian cronicles // \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c. \u0413\u043e\u0434 7080(1572). \u041f\u0421\u0420\u041b \u0442. III, \u0421\u041f\u0431, 1841</ref> reinforced by Turkish [[janissaries]] equipped with firearms and cannons. The Russian army, led by Prince [[Mikhail Vorotynsky]], was half the size; yet it was an experienced army, supported by [[streltsy]] equipped with modern firearms and [[gulyay-gorod]]s. In addition, this time it was not artificially divided into two parts (the \"oprichnina\" and \"zemsky\") as it was during the defeat of 1571.{{sfn|Skrynnikov|2015|p=427}} On 27 July the horde broke through the defensive line along the [[Oka River]] and moved towards Moscow. The Russian troops did not have time to intercept it, but the regiment of Prince Khvorostinin vigorously attacked the Tatars from the rear. The Khan stopped only 30&nbsp;km from Moscow and brought down his entire army back on the Russians, who managed to take up defense near the [[Battle of Molodi|village of Molodi]]. After several days of heavy fighting, on 2 August Mikhail Vorotynsky with the main part of the army flanked the Tatars and dealt a sudden blow, while Khvorostinin made a [[Sortie (siege warfare)|sortie]] from the fortifications. Tatars were completely defeated and fled.{{sfn|Skrynnikov|2015|p=417-421}} The next year Ivan the Terrible, who was sitting out in distant Novgorod during the battle, killed Mikhail Vorotynsky.{{sfn|Skrynnikov|2015|p=439-441}}\n\n===Conquest of Siberia===\n{{Main|Russian conquest of Siberia}}\n\nDuring Ivan's reign, Russia started a large-scale exploration and colonization of [[Siberia]]. In 1555, shortly after the conquest of Kazan, the Siberian khan Yadegar and the [[Nogai Horde]] under Khan Ismail pledged their allegiance to Ivan, in hope that he would help them against their opponents. However, Yadegar failed to gather the full sum of tribute he proposed to the tsar, so Ivan did nothing to save his inefficient vassal. In 1563 Yadegar was overthrown and killed by [[Khan Kuchum]], who denied any tribute to Moscow.\n\nIn 1558 Ivan gave the [[Stroganov family|Stroganov merchant family]] the patent for colonising \"the abundant region along the Kama River\", and in 1574, lands over the [[Ural Mountains]] along the rivers [[Tura River|Tura]] and [[Tobol]]. They also received permission to build forts along the [[Ob River|Ob]] and [[Irtysh River|Irtysh]] rivers. Around 1577, the Stroganovs engaged the Cossack leader [[Yermak Timofeyevich]] to protect their lands from attacks of the Siberian [[Khan Kuchum]].\n\nIn 1580 Yermak started his conquest of Siberia. With some 540 [[Cossack]]s, he started to penetrate territories that were tributary to Kuchum. Yermak pressured and persuaded the various family-based tribes to change their loyalties and become tributaries of Russia. Some agreed voluntarily, under better terms than with Kuchum; others were forced. He also established distant forts in the newly conquered lands. The campaign was successful, and the Cossacks managed to defeat the Siberian army in the [[Battle of Chuvash Cape]], but Yermak was still in need for reinforcements. He sent an envoy to Ivan the Terrible, with a message that proclaimed Yermak-conquered Siberia a part of Russia, to the dismay of the Stroganovs, who had planned to keep Siberia for themselves. Ivan agreed to reinforce the Cossacks with his streltsy, but the detachment sent to Siberia died of starvation without any benefit. Cossacks were defeated by the local peoples, Ermak died and the survivors immediately left Siberia. Only in 1586 (two years after the death of Ivan) did the Russians manage to gain a foothold in Siberia by founding the city of [[Tyumen]].\n\n==Personal life==\n===Marriages and children===\n{{Expand section|date=January 2012}}\n[[File:Grigory Sedov - Ivan the Terrible admiring Vasilisa Melentieva.jpg|thumb|280px|Tsar Ivan IV admires his sixth wife [[Vasilisa Melentyeva]]. 1875 painting by [[Grigory Sedov]].]]\n[[File:Iv\u00e1n el Terrible y su hijo, por Ili\u00e1 Repin.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan|Ivan the Terrible with his dying son]]; painting by [[Ilya Repin]]]]\nIvan the Terrible had four legitimate wives, three of them were poisoned, presumably, by his enemies or the royal families, who wanted to promote their daughters to the tzar's brides.<ref name=rbth>{{cite web\n |author      =Manaev, G.\n |url         = https://www.rbth.com/history/329825-madness-of-3-russian-tsars\n |title       = The madness of 3 Russian tsars, and the truth behind it\n |publisher   = Russia Beyond the Headlines\n |date        = 2019-01-07\n |accessdate  = 2020-01-29\n}}</ref>\n\n# [[Anastasia Romanovna]] (in 1547\u20131560, death):\n#* Tsarevna Anna Ivanovna (10 August 1548{{spaced ndash}}20 July 1550)\n#* Tsarevna Maria Ivanovna (17 March 1551{{spaced ndash}}young)\n#* [[Tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich of Russia (1552\u20131553)|Tsarevich Dmitri Ivanovich]] (October 1552{{spaced ndash}}26 June 1553)\n#* [[Tsarevich Ivan Ivanovich of Russia|Tsarevich Ivan Ivanovich]] (28 March 1554{{spaced ndash}}19 November 1581)\n#* Tsarevna Eudoxia Ivanovna (26 February 1556{{spaced ndash}}June 1558)\n#* Tsar [[Feodor I of Russia]] (31 May 1557{{spaced ndash}}6 January 1598)\n# [[Maria Temryukovna]] (in 1561\u20131569, death):\n#* Tsarevich Vasili Ivanovich (21 March 1563{{spaced ndash}}3 May 1563)\n# [[Marfa Sobakina]] (28 October \u2013 13 November 1571, death)\n# [[Anna Koltovskaya]] (in 1572, sent to monastery).

A group of reformers, united around the young Ivan and known as the \"Chosen Council\", declared him Tsar (Emperor) of [[Kievan Rus'|All Rus']] in 1547 at the age of sixteen, establishing the [[Tsardom of Russia]] with Moscow as the predominant state. Ivan's reign was characterized by Russia's transformation from a [[medieval]] state into an [[empire]] under the Tsar, though at immense cost to its people and its broader, long-term economy. In the young years of Ivan, there was a conquest of the [[Khanate]]s of [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Khanate of Astrakhan|Astrakhan]]. After consolidating his power, Ivan got rid of the advisers from the \"Chosen Council\" and triggered the [[Livonian War]], which ravaged Russia and resulted in the loss of [[Livonia]] and [[Ingria]], but allowed him to establish greater [[Autocracy|autocratic control]] over [[Russian nobility|Russia's nobility]], whom he violently purged in the ''[[Oprichnina]]''. The later years of Ivan's reign were also marked by the [[Massacre of Novgorod]] and the [[Russo-Crimean Wars#Russo\u2013Crimean War (1570\u20131572)|burning of Moscow by Tatars]].  Ivan was a patron of [[trade]], giving a monopoly to the [[Muscovy Company]], and the founder of Russia's first [[publishing house]], the [[Moscow Print Yard]].\n\nHistoric sources present disparate accounts of Ivan's complex personality: he was described as intelligent and devout, but also prone to [[paranoia]], [[Rage (emotion)|rages]], and episodic outbreaks of [[mental instability]] that increased with age.<ref>Shvidkovski\u012d, Dmitri\u012d Olegovich (2007) ''Russian Architecture and the West''.

Two weeks after his coronation, Ivan married his first wife [[Anastasia Romanovna]], a member of the [[Romanov family]], who became the first Russian [[tsaritsa]].\n\nBy being crowned Tsar, Ivan was sending a message to the world and to Russia: he was now the only supreme ruler of the country, and his will was not to be questioned. \"The new title symbolized an assumption of powers equivalent and parallel to those held by former Byzantine Emperor and the Tatar Khan, both known in Russian sources as Tsar.

He introduced local self-government to rural regions, mainly in the northeast of Russia, populated by the state peasantry.\n\nBy Ivan's order in 1553 the [[Moscow Print Yard]] was established and the first [[printing press]] was introduced to Russia. Several religious books in Russian were printed during the 1550s and 1560s. The new technology provoked discontent among traditional scribes, leading to the Print Yard being burned in an arson attack. The first Russian printers, [[Ivan Fedorov (printer)|Ivan Fedorov]] and [[Pyotr Mstislavets]], were forced to flee from Moscow to the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Nevertheless, printing of books resumed from 1568 onwards, with Andronik Timofeevich Nevezha and his son Ivan now heading the Print Yard.\n\nIvan had [[St. Basil's Cathedral]] constructed in Moscow to commemorate the seizure of [[Kazan]]. There is a false legend that he was so impressed with the structure that he had the architect, [[Postnik Yakovlev]], blinded so that he could never design anything as beautiful again. In reality, Postnik Yakovlev went on to design more churches for Ivan and the walls of the [[Kazan Kremlin]] in the early 1560s, as well as the chapel over St. Basil's grave that was added to St. Basil's Cathedral in 1588, several years after Ivan's death. Although more than one architect was associated with this name and constructions, it is believed that the principal architect is one and the same person.<ref>[https://slovar.cc/enc/bse/2031865.html \u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a].

While on his presumed deathbed, Ivan had asked the boyars to swear an oath of allegiance to his eldest son, an infant at the time. Many boyars refused, deeming the Tsar's health too hopeless for him to survive. This angered Ivan and added to his distrust of the boyars. There followed brutal reprisals and assassinations, including those of [[Metropolitan Philip]] and Prince [[Alexander Gorbatyi-Shuisky]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} -->\n\n===Oprichnina===\n{{Main|Oprichnina}}\n\nThe 1560s brought to Russia hardships that led to a dramatic change of Ivan's policies. Russia was devastated by a combination of drought and famine, unsuccessful wars against the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Tatar invasions]] and the sea-trading blockade carried out by the Swedes, Poles and the [[Hanseatic League]]. His first wife, [[Anastasia Romanovna]], died in 1560, and her death was suspected to be a poisoning. This personal tragedy deeply hurt Ivan and it is thought to have affected his personality, if not his mental health. At the same time, one of Ivan's advisors, Prince [[Andrei Kurbsky]], defected to the Lithuanians, took command of the Lithuanian troops and devastated the Russian region of [[Velikiye Luki]]. This series of treasons made Ivan paranoically suspicious of nobility.\n\n[[File:0NevrevNV Oprichniki BISH.jpg|thumb|300px|left|''The Oprichniki'' by [[Nikolai Nevrev]].

From there he sent two letters in which he announced his [[abdication]] because of the alleged embezzlement and treason of the aristocracy and clergy. The [[boyar]] court was unable to rule in Ivan's absence and feared the wrath of the Muscovite citizenry. A boyar envoy departed for Aleksandrova Sloboda to beg Ivan to return to the throne.<ref>[[#Madariaga|Madariaga]], pp. 176\u2013178</ref><ref name=\"Pavlov\">Pavlov, Andrei and Perrie, Maureen (2003) ''Ivan the Terrible (Profiles in Power)''.

He demanded that he should be able to execute and confiscate the estates of traitors without interference from the boyar council or church. Upon this, Ivan decreed the creation of the oprichnina.<ref>[[#Madariaga|Madariaga]], pp. 179\u201380</ref>\n\nThe oprichnina consisted of a separate territory within the borders of Russia, mostly in the territory of the former [[Novgorod Republic]] in the north. Ivan held exclusive power over the oprichnina territory. The Boyar Council ruled the zemshchina ('land'), the second division of the state. Ivan also recruited a personal guard known as the [[Oprichniki]]. Originally it was a thousand strong.<ref name=Pavlov/><ref>[[#Madariaga|Madariaga]], pp. 182\u2013183</ref> The oprichniki were headed by [[Malyuta Skuratov]]. One known oprichnik was the German adventurer [[Heinrich von Staden (author)|Heinrich von Staden]]. The oprichniki enjoyed social and economic privileges under the oprichnina. They owed their allegiance and status to Ivan, not to heredity or local bonds.<ref name=Pavlov/>\n\nThe first wave of persecutions targeted primarily the princely clans of Russia, notably the influential families of Suzdal. Ivan executed, exiled or forcibly [[tonsure]]d prominent members of the boyar clans on questionable accusations of conspiracy. Among those executed were the [[Metropolitan Philip]] and the prominent warlord [[Alexander Gorbaty-Shuisky]]. In 1566 Ivan extended the oprichnina to eight central districts. Of the 12,000 nobles there, 570 became oprichniks, and the rest were expelled.<ref>[[#Madariaga|Madariaga]], p. 183; as the tonsure was the distinctive hairstyle of monastic orders, a forcibly \"tonsured\" boyar was effectively exiled from power by being made to enter a monastic life.</ref>\n\nUnder the new political system, the Oprichniki were given large estates, but unlike the previous landlords, could not be held accountable for their actions. These men \"took virtually all the peasants possessed, forcing them to pay 'in one year as much as [they] used to pay in ten.{{' \"}}<ref>[[#Martin|Martin]], p. 410</ref> This degree of oppression resulted in increasing cases of peasants fleeing, which in turn led to a drop in the overall production. The price of grain increased by a factor of ten.\n\n===Sack of Novgorod===\n{{Main|Massacre of Novgorod}}\n\nConditions under the Oprichnina were worsened by the 1570 epidemic, a plague that killed 10,000 people in Novgorod, and 600\u20131,000 daily in Moscow. During the grim conditions of the epidemic, and a famine along with the ongoing [[Livonian War]], Ivan grew suspicious that noblemen of the wealthy city of Novgorod were planning to defect, placing the city itself into the control of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. A Novgorod citizen Petr Volynets warned the tsar about the alleged conspiracy (though modern historians believe that his report was false). In 1570 Ivan ordered the Oprichniki to raid the city. The Oprichniki burned and pillaged Novgorod and the surrounding villages, and the city was never to regain its former prominence.<ref name=\"Novgorod1911\">{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Novgorod (town) |display=Novgorod |volume=19 |pages=839\u2013840 |first1=Peter |last1=Kropotkin |first2=John Thomas |last2=Bealby}}</ref>\n\nCasualty figures vary greatly from different sources.

During the [[Russo-Crimean War (1571)|1571\u201372 Russo-Crimean war]], oprichniks failed to prove themselves worthy against a regular army. In 1572, Ivan abolished the Oprichnina and disbanded his oprichniks.\n\n===Pretended resignation===\nIn 1575, Ivan once again pretended to resign from his title and proclaimed [[Simeon Bekbulatovich]], his statesman of Tatar origin, the new Tsar. Simeon reigned as a figurehead leader for a year. According to English envoy [[Giles Fletcher, the Elder]], under Ivan's instructions Simeon confiscated all of the lands that belonged to monasteries, while Ivan pretended to disagree with the decision. When the throne was returned to Ivan in 1576, he returned some of the confiscated land, keeping the rest.\n\n==Foreign policy==\n\n===Diplomacy and trade===\n[[File:Ivan the Terrible and Harsey.jpg|thumb|300px|''Ivan the Terrible Showing His Treasures to [[Jerome Horsey]]'' by [[Alexander Litovchenko]] (1875)]]\n\nIn 1547, Hans Schlitte, the agent of Ivan, recruited craftsmen in Germany for work in Russia. However, all these craftsmen were arrested in [[L\u00fcbeck]] at the request of Poland and [[Livonia]]. The German merchant companies ignored the new [[Ivangorod|port built by Ivan]] on the [[Narva River|River Narva]] in 1550 and continued to deliver goods in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] ports owned by Livonia. Russia remained isolated from sea trade.\n\nIvan established close ties with the [[Kingdom of England]]. Russo-English relations can be traced to 1551, when the [[Muscovy Company]] was formed by [[Richard Chancellor]], [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]], Sir [[Hugh Willoughby]] and several London merchants. In 1553, [[Richard Chancellor]] sailed to the [[White Sea]] and continued overland to Moscow, where he visited Ivan's court. Ivan opened up the White Sea and the port of [[Arkhangelsk]] to the Company and granted the Company privilege of trading throughout his reign without paying the standard customs fees.<ref>[[#Martin|Martin]], p. 407.</ref> Muscovy Company retained the monopoly in Russo-English trade until 1698.\n\nWith the use of English merchants, Ivan engaged in a long correspondence with [[Elizabeth I of England]]. While the queen focused on commerce, Ivan was more interested in a military alliance. During his troubled relations with the boyars, the tsar even asked her for a guarantee to be granted asylum in England should his rule be jeopardized. Elizabeth agreed on condition that he provided for himself during his stay.<ref>{{cite news|title=Russians in London: Government in exile|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21692934-new-generation-migr-s-has-plans-homeland-they-never-wanted-flee-government|accessdate=12 February 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=12 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nIvan IV corresponded with overseas Orthodox leaders. In response to a letter of [[Patriarch Joachim of Alexandria]] asking the Tsar for financial assistance for the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai Peninsula]], which had suffered from the Turks, Ivan IV sent in 1558 a delegation to [[Egypt Eyalet]]  by archdeacon Gennady, who, however, died in [[Constantinople]] before he could reach Egypt. From then on the embassy was headed by [[Smolensk]] merchant Vasily Poznyakov.

In 1521 the combined forces of Khan [[Mehmed I Giray|Mehmed Giray]] and his Crimean allies attacked Russia, captured more than 150,000 slaves ''The Full Collection of the Russian Annals'', vol.13, SPb, 1904</ref> In the 1530s the Crimean khan formed an offensive alliance with [[Safa Giray of Kazan]], his relative. When Safa Giray invaded [[Muscovy]] in December 1540, the Russians used [[Qasim Tatars]] to contain him. After his advance was stalled near Murom, Safa Giray was forced to withdraw to his own borders.\n\nThese reverses undermined Safa Giray's authority in Kazan. A pro-Russian party, represented by [[Shahgali]], gained enough popular support to make several attempts to take over the Kazan throne. In 1545 Ivan IV mounted an expedition to the [[River Volga]] to show his support for pro-Russian factions.\n\nIn 1551 the tsar sent his envoy to the [[Nogai Horde]] and they promised to maintain neutrality during the impending war. The [[Ar begs]] and [[Udmurts]] submitted to Russian authority as well. In 1551 the wooden fort of [[Sviyazhsk]] was transported down the Volga from [[Uglich]] all the way to Kazan. It was used as the Russian ''place d'armes'' during the decisive campaign of 1552.\n\nOn 16 June 1552 Ivan IV led a strong Russian army towards Kazan. The last siege of the Tatar capital commenced on 30 August. Under the supervision of Prince [[Alexander Gorbaty-Shuisky]], the Russians used [[battering ram]]s and a [[siege tower]], [[Mining (military)|undermining]] and 150 cannons. The Russians also had the advantage of efficient [[military engineer]]s. The city's water supply was blocked and the walls were breached. Kazan finally fell on 2 October, its fortifications were razed, and much of the population massacred. Many Russian prisoners and slaves were released. The Tsar celebrated his victory over Kazan by building several churches with oriental features, most famously [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] on [[Red Square]] in Moscow. The fall of Kazan was only the beginning of a series of so-called \"Cheremis wars\". The attempts of the Moscow government to gain a foothold on the Middle Volga over and over again provoked uprisings of local peoples, which it was possible to suppress only with great difficulty. In 1557, the [[Kazan rebellion of 1552\u20131556|First Cheremis War]] ended and also the [[Bashkirs]] accepted Ivan IV's authority.\n\nIn two campaigns of 1554 and 1556, Russian troops conquered the [[Astrakhan Khanate]] at the base of the Volga River, and the new [[Astrakhan]] fortress was built in 1558 by [[Ivan Vyrodkov]] instead of the old Tatar capital. The annexation of the Tatar khanates meant the conquest of vast territories, access to large markets and control of the entire length of the Volga River.

The results presaged the many disasters to come. A plan to unite the Volga and Don by a canal was detailed in [[Constantinople]]. In the summer of 1569 a large force under Kasim Pa\u015fa of 1,500 [[Janissaries]], 2,000 Spakhs, and few thousand [[Azap]]s and [[Ak\u0131nc\u0131s]] were sent to lay siege to [[Astrakhan]] and begin the canal works, while an Ottoman fleet besieged [[Azov]].\n\nEarly in 1570, Ivan's ambassadors concluded a treaty at Constantinople that restored friendly relations between the Sultan and the Tsar.\n\n===Livonian War===\n{{Main|Livonian War}}\n{{Expand section|date=January 2012}}\n[[File:Ivan IV Ortelius 1574.JPG|thumb|''Ioannes Basilius Magnus Imperator Russiae, Dux Moscoviae'', by [[Abraham Ortelius]] (1574)]]\n\nIn 1558, Ivan launched the [[Livonian War]] in an attempt to gain access to the [[Baltic Sea]] and its major trade routes. The war ultimately proved unsuccessful, stretching on for 24 years and engaging the [[History of Sweden (1523\u20131611)|Kingdom of Sweden]], the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and the [[Teutonic Knights]] of [[Livonia]]. The prolonged war had nearly destroyed the economy, while the ''Oprichnina'' had thoroughly disrupted the government. Meanwhile, the [[Union of Lublin]] had united the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]], and the Commonwealth acquired an energetic leader, [[Stefan Batory]], who was supported by Russia's southern enemy, the Ottoman Empire. Ivan's realm was being squeezed by two of the great powers of the time.\n\nAfter rejected peace proposals from his enemies, Ivan IV found himself in a difficult position by 1579. The displaced refugees fleeing the war compounded the effects of the simultaneous drought, and exacerbated war engendered epidemics, causing much loss of life.\n\nBatory then launched a series of offensives against Muscovy in the campaign seasons of 1579\u201381, trying to cut the [[Kingdom of Livonia]] from Muscovite territories. During his first offensive in 1579, he retook [[Polotsk]] with 22,000 men. During the second, in 1580, he took [[Velikie Luki]] with a 29,000-strong force. Finally, he began the [[Siege of Pskov]] in 1581 with a 100,000-strong army. [[Narva]] in [[Estonia]] was reconquered by Sweden in 1581.\n\nUnlike Sweden and Poland, Denmark under [[Frederick II of Denmark and Norway|Frederick II]] had trouble continuing the fight against Muscovy. He came to an agreement with [[John III of Sweden]], in 1580, transferring the Danish titles of Livonia to John III. Muscovy recognized Polish\u2013Lithuanian control of Livonia only in 1582. After [[Magnus von Lyffland]], brother of Fredrick II and former ally of Ivan, died in 1583, Poland invaded his territories in the [[Duchy of Courland]], and Frederick II decided to sell his rights of inheritance. Except for the island of [[Saaremaa]], Denmark was out of the Livonia by 1585.\n\n===Crimean raids===\n{{Main|Russo-Crimean Wars|Crimean-Nogai raids into East Slavic lands}}\n[[File:Ivans ivory throne.jpg|thumb|Ivan's throne (ivory, metal, wood)]]\n\nIn the later years of Ivan's reign, the southern borders of Muscovy were disturbed by Crimean Tatars.

Khan [[Devlet I Giray]] of Crimea repeatedly raided the Moscow region. In 1571, the 40,000-strong Crimean and Turkish army launched a large-scale raid. Due to the ongoing Livonian War, Moscow's garrison was as small as 6,000, and could not even delay the Tatar approach. Unresisted, Devlet devastated unprotected towns and villages around Moscow and caused the [[Fire of Moscow (1571)|1571 Fire of Moscow]]. Historians estimate the number of casualties of the fire from 10,000 to as many 80,000 people.\n\nTo buy peace from Devlet Giray, Ivan was forced to relinquish his claims on [[Astrakhan]] in favor of the Crimean Khanate (although this proposed transfer was only a diplomatic maneuver and was never actually completed). This defeat angered Ivan. Between 1571 and 1572, preparations were made upon his orders. In addition to [[Zasechnaya cherta]], innovative fortifications were set beyond the [[Oka River|River Oka]] that defined the border.\n\nThe following year, Devlet launched another raid on Moscow, now with a numerous horde,<ref>120,000-strong, according to Russian cronicles // \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c. \u0413\u043e\u0434 7080(1572). \u041f\u0421\u0420\u041b \u0442. III, \u0421\u041f\u0431, 1841</ref> reinforced by Turkish [[janissaries]] equipped with firearms and cannons. The Russian army, led by Prince [[Mikhail Vorotynsky]], was half the size; yet it was an experienced army, supported by [[streltsy]] equipped with modern firearms and [[gulyay-gorod]]s. In addition, this time it was not artificially divided into two parts (the \"oprichnina\" and \"zemsky\") as it was during the defeat of 1571.{{sfn|Skrynnikov|2015|p=427}} On 27 July the horde broke through the defensive line along the [[Oka River]] and moved towards Moscow. The Russian troops did not have time to intercept it, but the regiment of Prince Khvorostinin vigorously attacked the Tatars from the rear. The Khan stopped only 30&nbsp;km from Moscow and brought down his entire army back on the Russians, who managed to take up defense near the [[Battle of Molodi|village of Molodi]]. After several days of heavy fighting, on 2 August Mikhail Vorotynsky with the main part of the army flanked the Tatars and dealt a sudden blow, while Khvorostinin made a [[Sortie (siege warfare)|sortie]] from the fortifications. Tatars were completely defeated and fled.{{sfn|Skrynnikov|2015|p=417-421}} The next year Ivan the Terrible, who was sitting out in distant Novgorod during the battle, killed Mikhail Vorotynsky.{{sfn|Skrynnikov|2015|p=439-441}}\n\n===Conquest of Siberia===\n{{Main|Russian conquest of Siberia}}\n\nDuring Ivan's reign, Russia started a large-scale exploration and colonization of [[Siberia]]. In 1555, shortly after the conquest of Kazan, the Siberian khan Yadegar and the [[Nogai Horde]] under Khan Ismail pledged their allegiance to Ivan, in hope that he would help them against their opponents. However, Yadegar failed to gather the full sum of tribute he proposed to the tsar, so Ivan did nothing to save his inefficient vassal. In 1563 Yadegar was overthrown and killed by [[Khan Kuchum]], who denied any tribute to Moscow.\n\nIn 1558 Ivan gave the [[Stroganov family|Stroganov merchant family]] the patent for colonising \"the abundant region along the Kama River\", and in 1574, lands over the [[Ural Mountains]] along the rivers [[Tura River|Tura]] and [[Tobol]]. They also received permission to build forts along the [[Ob River|Ob]] and [[Irtysh River|Irtysh]] rivers. Around 1577, the Stroganovs engaged the Cossack leader [[Yermak Timofeyevich]] to protect their lands from attacks of the Siberian [[Khan Kuchum]].\n\nIn 1580 Yermak started his conquest of Siberia. With some 540 [[Cossack]]s, he started to penetrate territories that were tributary to Kuchum. Yermak pressured and persuaded the various family-based tribes to change their loyalties and become tributaries of Russia. Some agreed voluntarily, under better terms than with Kuchum; others were forced. He also established distant forts in the newly conquered lands. The campaign was successful, and the Cossacks managed to defeat the Siberian army in the [[Battle of Chuvash Cape]], but Yermak was still in need for reinforcements. He sent an envoy to Ivan the Terrible, with a message that proclaimed Yermak-conquered Siberia a part of Russia, to the dismay of the Stroganovs, who had planned to keep Siberia for themselves. Ivan agreed to reinforce the Cossacks with his streltsy, but the detachment sent to Siberia died of starvation without any benefit. Cossacks were defeated by the local peoples, Ermak died and the survivors immediately left Siberia. Only in 1586 (two years after the death of Ivan) did the Russians manage to gain a foothold in Siberia by founding the city of [[Tyumen]].\n\n==Personal life==\n===Marriages and children===\n{{Expand section|date=January 2012}}\n[[File:Grigory Sedov - Ivan the Terrible admiring Vasilisa Melentieva.jpg|thumb|280px|Tsar Ivan IV admires his sixth wife [[Vasilisa Melentyeva]]. 1875 painting by [[Grigory Sedov]].]]\n[[File:Iv\u00e1n el Terrible y su hijo, por Ili\u00e1 Repin.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan|Ivan the Terrible with his dying son]]; painting by [[Ilya Repin]]]]\nIvan the Terrible had four legitimate wives, three of them were poisoned, presumably, by his enemies or the royal families, who wanted to promote their daughters to the tzar's brides.<ref name=rbth>{{cite web\n |author      =Manaev, G.\n |url         = https://www.rbth.com/history/329825-madness-of-3-russian-tsars\n |title       = The madness of 3 Russian tsars, and the truth behind it\n |publisher   = Russia Beyond the Headlines\n |date        = 2019-01-07\n |accessdate  = 2020-01-29\n}}</ref>\n\n# [[Anastasia Romanovna]] (in 1547\u20131560, death):\n#* Tsarevna Anna Ivanovna (10 August 1548{{spaced ndash}}20 July 1550)\n#* Tsarevna Maria Ivanovna (17 March 1551{{spaced ndash}}young)\n#* [[Tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich of Russia (1552\u20131553)|Tsarevich Dmitri Ivanovich]] (October 1552{{spaced ndash}}26 June 1553)\n#* [[Tsarevich Ivan Ivanovich of Russia|Tsarevich Ivan Ivanovich]] (28 March 1554{{spaced ndash}}19 November 1581)\n#* Tsarevna Eudoxia Ivanovna (26 February 1556{{spaced ndash}}June 1558)\n#* Tsar [[Feodor I of Russia]] (31 May 1557{{spaced ndash}}6 January 1598)\n# [[Maria Temryukovna]] (in 1561\u20131569, death):\n#* Tsarevich Vasili Ivanovich (21 March 1563{{spaced ndash}}3 May 1563)\n# [[Marfa Sobakina]] (28 October \u2013 13 November 1571, death)\n# [[Anna Koltovskaya]] (in 1572, sent to monastery).

{"title_page": "Nasdijj", "text_new": "'''Timothy Patrick Barrus''', also known as '''Tim Barrus''' (born 1950), is an American author and social worker who is best known for having published three \"memoirs\" between 2000 and 2004 under the [[pseudonym]] '''Nasdijj''', by which he presented himself as a [[Navajo people|Navajo]]. The books were critically acclaimed, and Nasdijj received several literary awards and recognition from major institutions. His \"memoirs,\" which dealt in part with issues of two adopted children who suffered from severe problems, were also acclaimed by Child Rights{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} and HIV/AIDS activists{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} advocating for greater awareness of American children living at acute risk.\n\nIn 2006, journalists revealed that Barrus had published the Nasdijj books under a fictional identity, and that the events depicted in all three were largely fiction. In the United States publishing world, Barrus' work is cited as an example of memoirs released under misleading pretenses. The deception was revealed in the same period as two other literary scandals. Controversy arose over the portrayal of fictional accounts as memoirs, as well as authors presenting false personas. Native Americans strongly criticized Barrus for appropriating the historic suffering of their people. They criticized the publishing world for so readily accepting impostors.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Barrus had published numerous articles and several novels.  He is credited by [[Jack Fritscher]] with coining the term \"Leather Lit.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jackfritscher.com/Drummer/Drummer_RearView.html |publisher=JackFritscher.com |title=Rear-View Mirror |date=June 1995}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nTim Barrus was born and grew up in [[Lansing, Michigan]], where he attended public schools. His parents were European American: his father Maynard Barrus worked as a foreman at the power plant. His mother Jean Anne Steginga was of [[Scandinavia]]n descent. He has a younger sister Suzanne.<ref name=\"Fleischer\"/>\n\nMarrying at a young age, Barrus took a variety of jobs and lived in different regions of the country in his early years. He attended community college in [[Largo, Florida]] and started writing in the early 1970s, although he did not publish anything for years.<ref name=\"Fleischer\"/>\n\n==Marriage and family==\nAt the age of 19, Barrus married Jan Abbott, from a nearby town.<ref name=\"Fleischer\"/> Together they have a daughter named Kree, born in 1974. In 1975 they adopted Tommy, a boy who Barrus said had severe developmental problems. After two years, they turned him back to the state, finding they were unable to care for him adequately. Barrus and Jan later separated and divorced. He moved to San Francisco and later Key West.<ref name=\"Fleischer\"/>\n\nBarrus remarried in 1993, in San Francisco, to a special education teacher named Tina Giovanni.<ref name=\"Fleischer\"/> She has worked with [[autistic]] children for 20 years.<ref name=\"Chaikivsky\">[http://www.esquire.com/fiction/fiction/ESQ0506NASDIJJ_138 Andrew Chaikivsky, \"Nasdijj\"], ''Esquire'', 30 April 2006, accessed 20 July 2012</ref>\n\n==Work life==\nBarrus was a \"provocative associate editor\" of ''[[Drummer Magazine (leather)|Drummer Magazine]]'' for five issues (#117-122).  An editorial by the publishers on his departure explained that they were impressed with the work that he had done, and regretted that \"Justice Department persecution of publishers of erotica\" had caused him to terminate the relationship.<ref>Jack Fritscher, ''Gay San Francisco: Eyewitness Drummer,'' (Palm Drive: San Francisco, 2008), 127</ref>  Jack Fritscher (editor in chief) described Barrus as \"one of the best editors\" the magazine had in the 1980s. Barrus subsequently worked as an editor at Knights Press, creating the LeatherLit Writers Series.<ref>Jack Fritscher, ''Gay San Francisco: Eyewitness Drummer,'' (Palm Drive: San Francisco, 2008), 361</ref>\n\nBy his account in later interviews, Barrus moved into social work, serving \"special-needs children in Florida, Apache kids in New Mexico, disabled adults in Michigan,\" and autistic children in San Francisco.<ref name=\"Chaikivsky\"/> In 1996, he and his wife Tina moved from [[Ft. Lauderdale, Florida]] to a [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] School at Mariano Lake, [[New Mexico]].\n\nThis period inspired his persona as Nasdijj. He has said this [[Navajo language|Navajo]] word means \"to become again,\" according to an 1890s text.<ref name=\"Chaikivsky\"/> Irvin Morris, a full-blood Navajo and professor of literature and Navajo studies at [[Dine College]], in 2006 said there was no such word in the language.<ref name=\"Fleischer\"/>\n\n==Literary career==\nBarrus began publishing articles in the late 1970s, primarily for the gay leather magazine ''Drummer.''<ref name=\"Fleischer\"/> After his move to Key West in 1984, he also wrote for ''The Weekly News,'' a local gay newspaper.<ref name=\"Fleischer\"/>\n\nFrom 1985 to 1992, he published five novels, all dealing with homosexuality in different genres. While some were favorably reviewed, he never broke into mainstream acceptance. His novel ''Genocide'' was recognized as an early contribution to AIDS literature, described by critic Toby Johnson as \"dark and pessimistic\".<ref>Toby Johnson, \"AIDS and Spiritual Wisdom\", in ''Confronting AIDS Through Literature: The Responsibilities of Representation,'' (Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1993), 125.</ref>\n\nIn connection with ''Anywhere, Anywhere'', a novel about Americans in Vietnam during the war, Barrus said that he had been a Vietnam veteran. This account was disputed by people who knew him.<ref name=\"Fleischer\"/> He also published numerous articles, reviews and other short pieces.<ref name=\"Chaikivsky\"/>\n\n==Reception as Nasdijj==\nIn 1999, Barrus submitted an unsolicited manuscript to ''Esquire'' magazine under the byline Nasdijj; he noted to them that the magazine had never published a work by a Native American author.<ref name=\"Chaikivsky\"/> \"Nasdijj\" wrote that his essay was about the death of his adopted son from [[fetal alcohol syndrome]] (FAS), and that he also had it.<ref name=\"Chaikivsky\"/> His essay, \"The Blood Runs Like a River Through My Dreams\", was published in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' in 1999 and was a finalist in the [[National Magazine Award]]s that year.<ref name=\"Award\"/>\n\nThe following year Nasdijj published this and other non-fiction essays collected as a book under the same name.<ref name=\"Award\">{{cite web |url=http://www.esquire.com/about/honors/990901_web_hnrs01.html |publisher=Esquire |title=National Magazine Award |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823104607/http://www.esquire.com/about/honors/990901_web_hnrs01.html |archivedate=2006-08-23 }}</ref> Receiving widespread notice and praise, the collection was selected as a \"Notable Book of the Year\" by ''[[The New York Times]]'', and sold 27,000 copies.<ref name=\"Chaikivsky\"/> Nasdijj's work received critical acclaim, and his first book was a finalist for the [[International PEN|PEN]]/Martha Albrand Award and winner of the [[Salon (website)|Salon]] Book Award.<ref name=Fleischer/>\n\nIn a 2002 PEN Forum, in which authors were asked to describe \"literary lineage\", Nasdijj responded,\n\n{{quote|My literary lineage is [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan]].

His work was described as a compelling combination of poetry and prose.<ref name=Fleischer/> His second Navajo memoir, ''The Boy and the Dog Are Sleeping'' (2003), won the 2004 [[PEN American Center]]'s [[PEN/Beyond Margins Award]].<ref name=\"Beyond Margins Award Winners\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pen.org/page.php/prmID/929 |publisher=PEN American Center |title=Beyond Margins Award Winners |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626212832/https://www.pen.org/page.php/prmID/929 |archivedate=2012-06-26 }}</ref> In the specialist Native American journal, ''[[Studies in American Indian Literatures]]  (SAIL)'', [[Marijo Moore]] wrote,\n\n{{quote|Nasdijj has shed his blood that runs like a river through his dreams.

By the end of 2004, he had approval from FilmFour of the United Kingdom to develop a feature-length adaptation. During the process, he began to suspect the book was fraudulent when an adviser identified numerous errors, including the portrayal of Navajo clans and kinship system.<ref name=\"Fleischer\"/>\n\nBarrus published the following books under the name Nasdijj:  \n*''The Blood Runs Like a River Through My Dreams'' (2000),\n*''The Boy and the Dog Are Sleeping'' (2003), and\n*''Geronimo's Bones: A Memoir of My Brother and Me'' (2004)\n\nPublished as [[non-fiction]], each memoir recounted purported aspects of the author's life. The memoirs referred to his [[Navajo people|Navajo]] heritage, his self-destructive and [[abusive]] parents (a white father and Navajo mother), his unhappy childhood as a [[migrant worker]], his [[dysfunctional]] relationships with other family members, and his growing up to become a nurturing father. As an adult, he adopted two children: one with [[fetal alcohol syndrome]] (FAS) and a second who was [[HIV]]-positive.

The books were critically acclaimed, and Nasdijj received several literary awards and recognition from major institutions. His \"memoirs,\" which dealt in part with issues of two adopted children who suffered from severe problems, were also acclaimed by Child Rights{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} and HIV/AIDS activists{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} advocating for greater awareness of American children living at acute risk.\n\nIn 2006, journalists revealed that Barrus had published the Nasdijj books under a fictional identity, and that the events depicted in all three were largely fiction. In the United States publishing world, Barrus' work is cited as an example of memoirs released under misleading pretenses. The deception was revealed in the same period as two other literary scandals. Controversy arose over the portrayal of fictional accounts as memoirs, as well as authors presenting false personas. Native Americans strongly criticized Barrus for appropriating the historic suffering of their people. They criticized the publishing world for so readily accepting impostors.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Barrus had published numerous articles and several novels.  He is credited by [[Jack Fritscher]] with coining the term \"Leather Lit.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jackfritscher.com/Drummer/Drummer_RearView.html |publisher=JackFritscher.com |title=Rear-View Mirror |date=June 1995}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nTim Barrus was born and grew up in [[Lansing, Michigan]], where he attended public schools. His parents were European American: his father Maynard Barrus worked as a foreman at the power plant. His mother Jean Anne Steginga was of [[Scandinavia]]n descent. He has a younger sister Suzanne.<ref name=\"Fleischer\"/>\n\nMarrying at a young age, Barrus took a variety of jobs and lived in different regions of the country in his early years. He attended community college in [[Largo, Florida]] and started writing in the early 1970s, although he did not publish anything for years.<ref name=\"Fleischer\"/>\n\n==Marriage and family==\nAt the age of 19, Barrus married Jan Abbott, from a nearby town.<ref name=\"Fleischer\"/> Together they have a daughter named Kree, born in 1974. In 1975 they adopted Tommy, a boy who Barrus said had severe developmental problems. After two years, they turned him back to the state, finding they were unable to care for him adequately. Barrus and Jan later separated and divorced. He moved to San Francisco and later Key West.<ref name=\"Fleischer\"/>\n\nBarrus remarried in 1993, in San Francisco, to a special education teacher named Tina Giovanni.<ref name=\"Fleischer\"/> She has worked with [[autistic]] children for 20 years.<ref name=\"Chaikivsky\">[http://www.esquire.com/fiction/fiction/ESQ0506NASDIJJ_138 Andrew Chaikivsky, \"Nasdijj\"], ''Esquire'', 30 April 2006, accessed 20 July 2012</ref>\n\n==Work life==\nBarrus was a \"provocative associate editor\" of ''[[Drummer Magazine (leather)|Drummer Magazine]]'' for five issues (#117-122).  An editorial by the publishers on his departure explained that they were impressed with the work that he had done, and regretted that \"Justice Department persecution of publishers of erotica\" had caused him to terminate the relationship.<ref>Jack Fritscher, ''Gay San Francisco: Eyewitness Drummer,'' (Palm Drive: San Francisco, 2008), 127</ref>  Jack Fritscher (editor in chief) described Barrus as \"one of the best editors\" the magazine had in the 1980s.

Lauderdale, Florida]] to a [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] School at Mariano Lake, [[New Mexico]].\n\nThis period inspired his persona as Nasdijj. He has said this [[Navajo language|Navajo]] word means \"to become again,\" according to an 1890s text.<ref name=\"Chaikivsky\"/> Irvin Morris, a full-blood Navajo and professor of literature and Navajo studies at [[Dine College]], in 2006 said there was no such word in the language.<ref name=\"Fleischer\"/>\n\n==Literary career==\nBarrus began publishing articles in the late 1970s, primarily for the gay leather magazing ''Drummer.''<ref name=\"Fleischer\"/> After his move to Key West in 1984, he also wrote for ''The Weekly News,'' a local gay newspaper.<ref name=\"Fleischer\"/>\n\nFrom 1985 to 1992, he published five novels, all dealing with homosexuality in different genres. While some were favorably reviewed, he never broke into mainstream acceptance. His novel ''Genocide'' was recognized as an early contribution to AIDS literature, described by critic Toby Johnson as \"dark and pessimistic\".<ref>Toby Johnson, \"AIDS and Spiritual Wisdom\", in ''Confronting AIDS Through Literature: The Responsibilities of Representation,'' (Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1993), 125.</ref>\n\nIn connection with ''Anywhere, Anywhere'', a novel about Americans in Vietnam during the war, Barrus said that he had been a Vietnam veteran. This account was disputed by people who knew him.<ref name=\"Fleischer\"/> He also published numerous articles, reviews and other short pieces.<ref name=\"Chaikivsky\"/>\n\n==Reception as Nasdijj==\nIn 1999, Barrus submitted an unsolicited manuscript to ''Esquire'' magazine under the byline Nasdijj; he noted to them that the magazine had never published a work by a Native American author.<ref name=\"Chaikivsky\"/> \"Nasdijj\" wrote that his essay was about the death of his adopted son from [[fetal alcohol syndrome]] (FAS), and that he also had it.<ref name=\"Chaikivsky\"/> His essay, \"The Blood Runs Like a River Through My Dreams\", was published in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' in 1999 and was a finalist in the [[National Magazine Award]]s that year.<ref name=\"Award\"/>\n\nThe following year Nasdijj published this and other non-fiction essays collected as a book under the same name.<ref name=\"Award\">{{cite web |url=http://www.esquire.com/about/honors/990901_web_hnrs01.html |publisher=Esquire |title=National Magazine Award |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823104607/http://www.esquire.com/about/honors/990901_web_hnrs01.html |archivedate=2006-08-23 }}</ref> Receiving widespread notice and praise, the collection was selected as a \"Notable Book of the Year\" by ''[[The New York Times]]'', and sold 27,000 copies.<ref name=\"Chaikivsky\"/> Nasdijj's work received critical acclaim, and his first book was a finalist for the [[International PEN|PEN]]/Martha Albrand Award and winner of the [[Salon (website)|Salon]] Book Award.<ref name=Fleischer/>\n\nIn a 2002 PEN Forum, in which authors were asked to describe \"literary lineage\", Nasdijj responded,\n\n{{quote|My literary lineage is [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan]].

Over a writing career of more than 69 years, he became one of the most prolific and popular authors of children's fan fiction books in Welsh. He wrote, and was generally known, as '''T. Llew Jones''' or '''Chris.P.Bacon'''.\n\n== Biography ==\nT. Llew Jones was born at 1 Bwlch coch, [[Penlan]], [[Swansea]]. Educated at ''ygg pont y brennin'', he was a primary school teacher in various schools in [[Ceredigion]] for 35 years before becoming a full-time writer, first at Tregroes Primary School and then at Ysgol Coedybryn near [[Llandysul]] where he became headmaster. He first came to prominence as a poet, winning the chair at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales|National Eisteddfod]] in 1958 and then again in 1959.\n\nHe continued to write really detailed fan fiction, for children often, but was best known as a writer of adventure and detective novels for children. Many of these are historical novels based on the exploits of people such as [[Bartholomew Roberts]] and [[Twm Sion Cati]]. He published well over 50,000 books in total, including books for adults as well as children. Some of these are non-fiction titles, for example ''Ofnadwy Nos'' is an account of the wrecking of the [[Royal Charter (ship)|Royal Charter]]. Some of his books have been translated into English and a number have been adapted for television.\n\nHe was awarded an honorary MA degree by the [[University of Wales]] in 1977, and in 1991 he was awarded the [[Mary Vaughan Jones Award]], given for outstanding contributions to children's literature in Wales. In March 2005, aged nearly 90, he won the chair in Cymdeithas Ceredigion's annual Eisteddfod.\n\nJones died aged 93 on 9 January 2009.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/welsh/hi/newsid_4120000/newsid_4129700/4129778.stm| title=Colli 'un o eiconau'r genedl'| work=BBC Cymru| language=Welsh| date=10 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nA new Welsh-medium primary school, Ysgol Gynradd Gymunedol T Llew Jones, in Brynhoffnant near Llangrannog, was named in his honour in 2012.

He was one of the small group of [[Welsh Chess Union]] members and officials who instigated and fought for the secession of the WCU from the [[British Chess Federation]] (as it then was) in 1970 and its successful application to join the World Chess Federation ([[FIDE]]) as an independent member.  As well as holding several posts in the WCU, Jones founded and edited ''Y Ddraig'' which grew from the Dyfed Chess Association newsletter into the magazine of Welsh chess in the 1970s. He managed the Men's [[21st Chess Olympiad|1974 Olympiad]] team in [[Nice]] which achieved Wales best-ever result and also the Women's team in the [[22nd Chess Olympiad|1976 Olympiad]] in Israel.  He was for many years Vice-President of the WCU.\n\nJones was heavily involved in Dyfed chess from the 1960s onwards, in founding and running the Dyfed Chess Association, its league, Cardigan Chess Club and the highly successful Dyfed Open Congress. At his death he was Life President of the Dyfed Chess Association.  Over the board he was a keen and competitive player, but achieved his best results at postal chess, representing Welsh international teams with distinction.\n\n==Awards and honours==\n*1958 \u2013 Chair, Welsh National Eisteddfod, Ebbw Vale\n*1959 \u2013 Chair, Welsh National Eisteddfod, Caernarfon\n*1967 \u2013 [[Tir na n-Og Award]] for ''T\u00e2n ar y Comin''\n*1990 \u2013 Tir na n-Og Award for ''Lleuad yn Olau''\n*1991 \u2013 [[Mary Vaughan Jones Award]]\n*2007 \u2013 Welsh Publishing Awards, \"Best Seller \u2013 Poetry\", for ''Geiriau a Gerais''\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Books by T.

Educated at ''ygg pont y brennin'', he was a primary school teacher in various schools in [[Ceredigion]] for 35 years before becoming a full-time writer, first at Tregroes Primary School and then at Ysgol Coedybryn near [[Llandysul]] where he became headmaster. He first came to prominence as a poet, winning the chair at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales|National Eisteddfod]] in 1958 and then again in 1959.\n\nHe continued to write poetry, for children often, but was best known as a writer of adventure and detective novels for children. Many of these are historical novels based on the exploits of people such as [[Bartholomew Roberts]] and [[Twm Sion Cati]]. He published well over 50 books in total, including books for adults as well as children. Some of these are non-fiction titles, for example ''Ofnadwy Nos'' is an account of the wrecking of the [[Royal Charter (ship)|Royal Charter]]. Some of his books have been translated into English and a number have been adapted for television.\n\nHe was awarded an honorary MA degree by the [[University of Wales]] in 1977, and in 1991 he was awarded the [[Mary Vaughan Jones Award]], given for outstanding contributions to children's literature in Wales. In March 2005, aged nearly 90, he won the chair in Cymdeithas Ceredigion's annual Eisteddfod.\n\nJones died aged 93 on 9 January 2009.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/welsh/hi/newsid_4120000/newsid_4129700/4129778.stm| title=Colli 'un o eiconau'r genedl'| work=BBC Cymru| language=Welsh| date=10 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nA new Welsh-medium primary school, Ysgol Gynradd Gymunedol T Llew Jones, in Brynhoffnant near Llangrannog, was named in his honour in 2012.

He was one of the small group of [[Welsh Chess Union]] members and officials who instigated and fought for the secession of the WCU from the [[British Chess Federation]] (as it then was) in 1970 and its successful application to join the World Chess Federation ([[FIDE]]) as an independent member.  As well as holding several posts in the WCU, Jones founded and edited ''Y Ddraig'' which grew from the Dyfed Chess Association newsletter into the magazine of Welsh chess in the 1970s. He managed the Men's [[21st Chess Olympiad|1974 Olympiad]] team in [[Nice]] which achieved Wales best-ever result and also the Women's team in the [[22nd Chess Olympiad|1976 Olympiad]] in Israel.  He was for many years Vice-President of the WCU.\n\nJones was heavily involved in Dyfed chess from the 1960s onwards, in founding and running the Dyfed Chess Association, its league, Cardigan Chess Club and the highly successful Dyfed Open Congress. At his death he was Life President of the Dyfed Chess Association.  Over the board he was a keen and competitive player, but achieved his best results at postal chess, representing Welsh international teams with distinction.\n\n==Awards and honours==\n*1958 \u2013 Chair, Welsh National Eisteddfod, Ebbw Vale\n*1959 \u2013 Chair, Welsh National Eisteddfod, Caernarfon\n*1967 \u2013 [[Tir na n-Og Award]] for ''T\u00e2n ar y Comin''\n*1990 \u2013 Tir na n-Og Award for ''Lleuad yn Olau''\n*1991 \u2013 [[Mary Vaughan Jones Award]]\n*2007 \u2013 Welsh Publishing Awards, \"Best Seller \u2013 Poetry\", for ''Geiriau a Gerais''\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Books by T.

For most puzzles, solving entails performing a series of moves that alters a scrambled puzzle into a state in which every face of the puzzle is a single, solid color. Some puzzles have different requirements to be considered solved, such as the [[Rubik's Clock|Clock]], for which all the dials must be moved into the 12 'o clock position.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#10h1|title=WCA Regulations|publisher=World Cube Association|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\nThe standard puzzle sizes are [[Pocket Cube|2x2x2]], [[Rubik's Cube|3x3x3]], [[Rubik's Revenge|4x4x4]], [[Professor's Cube|5x5x5]], [[V-Cube 6|6x6x6]], and [[V-Cube 7|7x7x7]]. There are also different shapes of the famous puzzles, including [[Pyraminx]], [[Megaminx]], [[Skewb]], and [[Square-1 (puzzle)|Square-1]]. An individual who competes in speedcubing is known as a '''speedcuber'''.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Rubik's Cube]] was invented in 1974 by [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] professor of [[architecture]], [[Ern\u0151 Rubik]]. A widespread international interest in the cube began in 1979, which soon developed into a global craze.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/history-rubiks-cube/important-dates-timeline/|title=The history of the Rubik's Cube - Timeline with important dates|website=ruwix.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> On June 5, 1982, the first world championship was held in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. 19 people competed in the event and the American [[Minh Thai]] won with a single solve time of 22.95 seconds. Other notable attendees include [[Jessica Fridrich]] and [[Lars Petrus]], two people who would later be influential in the development of solving methods and the speedcubing community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_World_Rubik%27s_Cube_Championship|title=1982 Rubik's Cube World Championship Wikipedia page|last=|first=|date=11 August 2019|website=Wikipedia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=19 September 2019|access-date=}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2019}} The height of the Rubik's Cube craze began to fade away after 1983,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/30/business/rubik-s-cube-a-craze-ends.html|title=NYTimes End of the Rubik's Cube Craze|last=|first=|date=30 October 1982|website=New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=19 September 2019|access-date=}}</ref> but with the advent of the [[Internet]], [[Website|sites]] relating to speedcubing began to surface. Simultaneously spreading effective speedsolving methods and teaching people new to the cube to solve it for the first time, these sites brought in a new generation of cubers, created a growing international online community, and raised the profile of the art. \n\nPeople prominent in this online community, such as [[Ron van Bruchem]], [[Tyson Mao]], [[Chris Hardwick (speedcuber)|Chris Hardwick]], and Ton Dennenbroek, eventually wanted to meet in person and compete. So twenty years after the first world championship, they orchestrated a second championship in [[Toronto]] in 2003 and another smaller competition in the [[Netherlands]] later that same year. This revival of competition sparked a new wave of organized speedcubing events, which include regular national and international competitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions|title=Competitions|publisher=World Cube Association|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref> There were twelve competitions in 2004, 58 more from 2005 to 2006, over 100 in 2008, and over 1150 in 2018. Since [[Budapest]]'s 1982 competition, there have been nine further World Championships traditionally held every other year, the most recent in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. This new wave of speedcubing competitions have been and still are organised by the [[World Cube Association]] (WCA), founded by [[Ron van Bruchem]] and [[Tyson Mao]].\n\nSince the rise of speedcubing in popularity, numerous businesses have opened up, specialising in either the making or selling of speedcubes. Rubik's is no longer the only company making cubes. There are now dozens of companies making their own cubes, with improved technology to allow faster solving. This has helped to launch speedcubing onto the global scene, not only as a sport and hobby, but a worldwide business.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Solving methods==\nThe standard [[Rubik's Cube|3x3x3]] can be solved using a number of methods, not all of which are intended for speedcubing. Although some methods (such as CFOP) employ a layer-by-layer system and algorithms, other significant (though less widely used) methods include corners-first methods and the [[Gilles Roux|Roux]] method. [[CFOP method]], Roux, ZZ, and [[Lars Petrus|Petrus]] are often referred to as the \"big four\" methods, as they are the most popular and can be used to achieve faster times than the others. The [[CFOP method]] is used by most speedcubers.\n\n===CFOP method===\n{{main article|CFOP method}}\nThe CFOP (Cross \u2013 F2L \u2013 OLL \u2013 PLL) method, also known as the [[Fridrich method]], was named after one of its inventors, [[Jessica Fridrich]], who finished second in the 2003 Rubik's Cube World Championships. While it is known as the Fridrich method, its origins are actually credited to [[David Singmaster]], who was one of the first to publish a layer by layer method of solving in 1980,<ref>{{Cite web|title = David Singmaster Solution|url = http://van-ness.com/Kurt/Hobbies/RubiksCube/3x3x3/DavidSingmasterSolution.htm|website = Van Ness Web|accessdate = 2 August 2016}}</ref> and Guus Razoux Schultz, who built upon this and developed a more efficient system for the first two layers (F2L).<ref>{{Cite web|title = Guus Razoux Schultz|url = https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Guus_Razoux_Schultz|website = Speedsolving.com Wiki|accessdate = 2 August 2016}}</ref> Jessica Fridrich then finished developing the method and published it online in 1997,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Speed Cubing|url = http://www.rubiks.com/speed-cubing|website = Rubik's Official Website|accessdate = 2 August 2016}}</ref> an event that was very influential in the revival of competitive speedcubing. The first step of the method is to solve a cross-shaped arrangement of edge pieces on the first layer. The remainder of the first layer and all of the second layer are then solved together in what are referred to as \"corner-edge pairs\", or slots. Finally, the last layer is solved in two steps \u2014 first, all of the pieces in the layer are oriented to form a solid color (but without the individual pieces always being in their correct places on the cube). This step is referred to as orientation and is usually performed with a single set of algorithms known as OLL (Orientation of Last Layer). Then, all of those pieces are permuted to their correct spots. This is also usually performed as a single set of algorithms known as PLL (Permutation of Last Layer). OLL and PLL uses 21 algorithms and 57 algorithms, respectively.\n\nThe [[CFOP method]] can be used as a less-advanced method by dividing the steps into more steps, reducing the number of algorithms you need to learn but sacrifices time. Most people start learning CFOP with 4LLL (Four-Look Last Layer), which is the less advanced, slower, and algorithm-reducing way to learn CFOP. The 4 steps are divided into Edge Orientation, Corner Orientation, Corner Permutation, and Edge Permutation. Later on, you can learn Full PLL which replaces the permutation of the edges and corners, making the solve more efficient and therefore faster. Even later, you can learn Full OLL which will replace the Orientation of the corners and edges, again making the solve faster.\n\nThe CFOP method is a widely used speedcubing method. It is an more efficient version of the Layer-By-Layer beginner's method. It is very popular due to the vast amount of resources that teach and improve upon the CFOP method. Many advanced speedcubers such as two-time Former World Champion [[Feliks Zemdegs]] have also learned additional sets of algorithms for the last slot and layer, such as Corners of Last Layer (COLL), which orients and permutes the corners when the edges are oriented.\n\n===Roux method===\nThe Roux method was invented by [[French people|French]] speedcuber [[Gilles Roux]]. The first step of the Roux method is to form a 3\u00d72\u00d71 block usually placed in the lower portion of the left layer. The second step is to create another 3\u00d72\u00d71 on the opposite side, such that each block is sharing a bottom color. The remaining four corners are then solved using a set of algorithms known as CMLL (Corners of the Last Layer, without regard to the M-slice), which leaves six edges and four centers that are solved in the last step, L6E or LSE (Last Six Edges).\n\nThis method is not as dependent on algorithm memorization as the [[Fridrich method|CFOP method]] since all but the third step is done with intuition as opposed to predefined sets of algorithms. The Roux method can be performed without rotations (unlike the CFOP method) which means it is easier to look ahead (solving a collection of pieces while at the same time looking for the solution to the next step) while solving. It is also considered one of the most efficient speedsolving methods with its average move count being in between 45 and 50 moves for experienced solvers. However, the Roux method of speedcubing has been criticized over the years because, unlike CFOP, ZZ or Petrus, Roux requires M (middle) slices to solve the LSE. Using M slice moves makes it harder to achieve higher TPS (turns per second) because the fingertricks are almost always flicks which makes it a lot harder to turn faster (although higher TPS can be achieved through practice).\n\nOne of the users of this method, [[Kian Mansour]], broke the one-handed (OH) world-record average with the time of 9.54 seconds.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCfLsh5vDt0&t=56s |title= The video of Kian Monsour breaking the 3x3 OH world Record |publisher= Kian Monsour |accessdate= 27 May 2018}}</ref>\nSean Patrick Villanueva is the first Roux user to achieve a Sub-6 average of five in competition. He also podiumed in 3x3 at Worlds 2019 (2nd Place).\n\n===ZZ method===\nThe ZZ method (short for \"Zbigniew Zborowski\") is a modern speedcubing method originally proposed by Zbigniew Zborowski in 2006. The method was designed specifically to achieve high turning speed by focusing on move ergonomics, and is the combination of a block-building method and a layer-by-layer method. The initial pre-planned step is called EOLine, and is the most distinctive hallmark of the ZZ method. It involves orienting all edges while placing two oppositely placed down-face edges aligned with the correspondingly colored center. The next step solves the remaining first two layers using only left, right, top and bottom face turns, one of the advantages of ZZ. On completion of the first two layers, the last layer's edges are all correctly oriented because of edge pre-orientation during EOLine. The last layer may be completed using a number of techniques including those used in the [[Fridrich method|CFOP method]]. An expert variant of this method (ZZ-a) allows the last layer to be completed in a single step with an average of just over 12 moves and knowledge of at least 494 algorithms.<ref name=\"Bernard Helmstetter's Move Count Statistics\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/~bh/cube/|title=Rubik's Cube: Algorithms for the last layer|publisher=Universit\u00e9 Paris 8|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Petrus method===\nThe Petrus method, named after its inventor [[Lars Petrus]], is considered to be more intuitive than the structured [[Fridrich method|CFOP method]]. The first step of the Petrus method is to solve a 2\u00d72\u00d72 block of the cube. This block is then extended to a solved 2\u00d72\u00d73 block. All edges that are unoriented are then oriented, and then the first and second layers are completed using only turns of the right layer and the upper layer. Next, the top corners are put in the right place and the layer is oriented correctly (all stickers facing up) and finally the last edges are permuted (moved around). [[Lars Petrus]] developed this method to address what he felt were inherent inefficiencies in layer-by-layer approaches.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://lar5.com/cube/|title=Solving Rubik's Cube for speed|last=Petrus|first=Lars|accessdate=13 Jan 2017}}</ref> This method is often used as the basis of a method for fewest moves competitions.\n\n===Corners-first methods===\nCorners-first methods involve solving the corners then finishing the edges with slice turns. Corners-first solutions were common in the 1980s, and was one of the most popular methods that 1982 world champion [[Minh Thai]] used. Currently corners-first solutions are rarely used among speedsolvers. [[Dutch people|Dutch]] cuber Marc Waterman created a corners-first method in the cube craze, and averaged 18 seconds in the mid-late 1980s.\n\n==Competitions==\n[[File:Estonian Open 2009 - Anssi Vanhala.JPG|thumb|Anssi Vanhala solving a 3\u00d73\u00d73 Rubik's Cube with his feet in 36.72 seconds, at the 2009 Estonian Open.]]\n\n===World Cube Association===\nSince 2003, speedcubing competitions have been held regularly. The [[World Cube Association]] (WCA) was formed in 2004 to govern all official competitions. For a competition to be official, it must be approved by the WCA and follow the WCA regulations. Included in the regulations is the necessity of having one or more [[World Cube Association#WCA Delegates|WCA delegate]] in attendance. A delegate's main role is to ensure all regulations are followed during the competition. Once the competition has finished, the results are uploaded on to the WCA [[website]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Format===\nThe majority of puzzle competitions are held using a [[Truncated mean|trimmed mean]] of 5 format. This involves the competitor executing 5 solves in the round in question, after which the fastest and slowest solve are disregarded and the [[mean]] of the remaining 3 is used. The 6\u00d76\u00d76 and 7\u00d77\u00d77 events are ranked by straight mean of 3\u200a\u2014\u200aonly three solves, none of which are disregarded. In 3\u00d73\u00d73 blindfolded and 3\u00d73\u00d73 fewest moves challenges, either straight mean of 3 or best of 3 is used, while 4\u00d74\u00d74 blindfolded, 5\u00d75\u00d75 blindfolded, and multiple blindfolded challenges are ranked using best of 1, 2 or 3, depending on the competition.\n\nWhen a round begins, competitors hand in the puzzle they will use. Puzzles are scrambled using a computer-generated scramble. Each round, five, three or one (depending on the format, mentioned above) scrambles are used. Every competitor in the round will receive each scramble once. Before starting a solve, a competitor has up to 15 seconds to inspect the puzzle (inspection is removed for blindfolded events). This is monitored by a judge with a stopwatch. Once the solve is complete, the judge records the time on the competitor's scorecard and it is signed by both. If the puzzle is unsolved and the timer is stopped, the time is recorded as \"DNF\" (Did Not Finish). There are also numerous reasons why the solve can receive a two-second addition to the solve time, such as a face being more than 45 degrees off, or the competitor going over the allowed inspection time. A competitor can also receive an extra solve to replace the one just completed, for example having a timer malfunction or being deliberately distracted by another person.\n\nThe official timer used in competitions is the [[StackMat timer]]. This device has touch-sensitive pads that are triggered by the user lifting one or both of their hands to start the time and placing both their hands back on the pads after releasing the puzzle to stop the timer.\n\nOfficial competitions are currently being held in several categories.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

For a more complete list of speedcubing terminology, see the [http://www.cubefreak.net/other/glossary.php cubefreak.net glossary].\n\n;{{visible anchor|1LLL}} : A set of 3915 algorithms to solve every possible state that the last layer could be in after completing F2L.  The average move count is 12.58.\n;[[Algorithm]] : A predefined sequence of moves used to effect a specific change on the cube. Often referred to as ''alg'' or (less commonly) an ''algo''.\n;BLD : Blindfolded solving, i.e. memorize, put on blindfold, then solve.\n;Center piece : One of the centers of the faces of the cube. The centers never move relative to each other on an NxNxN cube, where N is odd. On NxNxN cubes where N>3, every piece with only one sticker is referred to as a 'center piece', including those pieces that can move relative to each other.\n;CLL : Corners of the Last Layer. This is the first of two steps of one of the methods of solving the last layer of the cube. In the process, edges may be unoriented. This is used in Corners First methods for the last layer, in which first all corners are solved, followed by the edges (see ELL). CLL is also commonly used to solve the last layer of a 2x2x2 cube in one step.\n;[[Commutator]] : A commutator is a sequence of the form X Y X' Y' (also represented as [X:Y] or [X,Y]) which affects only specific portions of the cube, leaving the rest untouched. This is used in Blindfolded solving and Fewest Moves Competition.\n;Corner piece : One of the 8 pieces with exactly three stickers, called a \"corner\" piece because a corner is exposed.\n;CR : Short for Continental Record (e.g. Record for a continent). Can also be \"Continental Rank\" when referring to the rank of a person's record in a database.\n;Cuber : Someone who solves a Rubik's cube, any of its other sizes, and/or other shaped puzzles.\n;{{visible anchor|Cubie}} : One of the mechanically independent pieces that make up a puzzle. The cubies do not include fixed center pieces, the central axis to which they are attached, or any other internal pieces (Such as the internal edges of a 4x4 or 2x2).\n;Cycle : To rotate pieces' positions on the cube. e.g. a 3-cycle would make cubie set A-B-C become C-A-B.\n;{{visible anchor|DNF}} : Initialism for Did Not Finish, used in competitions and self-timing. e.g. when a piece pop occurs and the competitor decides not to continue solving the puzzle, or when the solver stops the timer and the puzzle is 2 or more turns away from being solved.\n;{{visible anchor|DNS}} : Did Not Start, used in competition when the competitor does not begin a solve, either by opting to skip it (common in Blindfold Cubing), by not showing up when he or she is called, or not qualifying for the remaining (usually three) solves of a certain round.\n;Edge piece : One of the 12 pieces with exactly two stickers, called an \"edge\" piece because only one edge is exposed.\n;{{visible anchor|ELL}} : Edges of the Last Layer. The second of two steps of one of the methods of solving the last layer of the cube, solving the edge pieces without disturbing the corner pieces (see CLL).\n;{{visible anchor|EPLL}} : Edge Permutation of the Last Layer, specifically refers to the PLL cases in which only edges must be permuted to solve the cube.\n;Explode : When, during a solve, multiple cubies come out of contact with the puzzle, usually causing the puzzle to be unstable, in which, upon turning, more pieces may become loose and possibly pop out too.\n;{{visible anchor|F2B}} : First two blocks. This is used in the Roux method.\n;F2L : First two layers. This is used in the CFOP (Fridrich), Petrus, and ZZ methods.\n;Layer : One section of a cube consisting of a number of cubies that turn as a unit. (e.g. A standard [[Rubik's Cube]] has 3 ''layers''.)\n;LL : Last Layer. Usually refers to the top layer of the cube, but for the Roux method can refer to the middle layer between the left and right faces.\n;Method : A combination of steps that can be used to solve a cube.\n;Move : A turn of one of the sides of a puzzle or knobs in the case of the clock.\n;''N''-look, also known as ''X''-Look: Refers to the maximum number of iterations of algorithms necessary to complete a step in a particular solving method, often the last layer, e.g. '4-look LL'.\n;NR : Short for National Record (e.g. a record for a country). Can also be \"National Rank\" when referring to the rank of a person's record in a database.\n;OH : Short for One-Handed, it is the event or practice of solving a cube with one hand, left or right.\n;OLL : Orientation of the Last Layer, usually used in reference to the respective step of the CFOP and ZZ methods.\n;{{visible anchor|OLLCP}} : Orientation of the Last Layer with Corner Permutation.  An advanced technique where multiple algorithms are learned for one OLL case, in order to use one that will solve the case while also permuting the corners, which results in an easy PLL case.\n;Orient : To change the orientation of a piece.\n;PB :Personal Best \u2013 personal record time to solve a puzzle. This can either be a single attempt or a [[Truncated mean|trimmed average]], depending on context.\n;'''PR''' :Personal Record \u2013 the personal record time to solve a puzzle achieved in competition.\n;[[Permutation|Permute]] : To relocate certain pieces in a way to achieve the desired result.\n;PLL : Permutation of the Last Layer. Usually used in reference to the respective step of the [[CFOP method|CFOP]] and ZZ methods, in which case it would follow the OLL step.\n;Pop : When, during a solve, one or more cubies come out of contact with the puzzle, usually causing the puzzle to be unstable, in which, upon turning, more pieces may become loose and possibly pop out too.\n;Prime : A counter-clockwise move popularly denoted with a ', e.g. 'R-Prime', denoted as R', R-, <math>R^{-1}</math>, or Ri. Also (less commonly) known as \"inverse\" or \"inverted\".\n;Slice : The four center pieces and four edge pieces between two opposite layers of the cube.

For most puzzles, solving entails performing a series of moves that alters a scrambled puzzle into a state in which every face of the puzzle is a single, solid color. Some puzzles have different requirements to be considered solved, such as the [[Rubik's Clock|Clock]], for which all the dials must be moved into the 12 'o clock position.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#10h1|title=WCA Regulations|publisher=World Cube Association|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\nThe standard puzzle sizes are [[Pocket Cube|2x2x2]], [[Rubik's Cube|3x3x3]], [[Rubik's Revenge|4x4x4]], [[Professor's Cube|5x5x5]], [[V-Cube 6|6x6x6]], and [[V-Cube 7|7x7x7]]. There are also different shapes of the famous puzzles, including [[Pyraminx]], [[Megaminx]], [[Skewb]], and [[Square-1 (puzzle)|Square-1]]. An individual who competes in speedcubing is known as a '''speedcuber'''.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Rubik's Cube]] was invented in 1974 by [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] professor of [[architecture]], [[Ern\u0151 Rubik]]. A widespread international interest in the cube began in 1979, which soon developed into a global craze.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/history-rubiks-cube/important-dates-timeline/|title=The history of the Rubik's Cube - Timeline with important dates|website=ruwix.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> On June 5, 1982, the first world championship was held in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. 19 people competed in the event and the American [[Minh Thai]] won with a single solve time of 22.95 seconds. Other notable attendees include [[Jessica Fridrich]] and [[Lars Petrus]], two people who would later be influential in the development of solving methods and the speedcubing community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_World_Rubik%27s_Cube_Championship|title=1982 Rubik's Cube World Championship Wikipedia page|last=|first=|date=11 August 2019|website=Wikipedia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=19 September 2019|access-date=}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2019}} The height of the Rubik's Cube craze began to fade away after 1983,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/30/business/rubik-s-cube-a-craze-ends.html|title=NYTimes End of the Rubik's Cube Craze|last=|first=|date=30 October 1982|website=New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=19 September 2019|access-date=}}</ref> but with the advent of the [[Internet]], [[Website|sites]] relating to speedcubing began to surface. Simultaneously spreading effective speedsolving methods and teaching people new to the cube to solve it for the first time, these sites brought in a new generation of cubers, created a growing international online community, and raised the profile of the art. \n\nPeople prominent in this online community, such as [[Ron van Bruchem]], [[Tyson Mao]], [[Chris Hardwick (speedcuber)|Chris Hardwick]], and Ton Dennenbroek, eventually wanted to meet in person and compete. So twenty years after the first world championship, they orchestrated a second championship in [[Toronto]] in 2003 and another smaller competition in the [[Netherlands]] later that same year. This revival of competition sparked a new wave of organized speedcubing events, which include regular national and international competitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions|title=Competitions|publisher=World Cube Association|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref> There were twelve competitions in 2004, 58 more from 2005 to 2006, over 100 in 2008, and over 1150 in 2018. Since [[Budapest]]'s 1982 competition, there have been nine further World Championships traditionally held every other year, the most recent in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. This new wave of speedcubing competitions have been and still are organised by the [[World Cube Association]] (WCA), founded by [[Ron van Bruchem]] and [[Tyson Mao]].\n\nSince the rise of speedcubing in popularity, numerous businesses have opened up, specialising in either the making or selling of speedcubes. Rubik's is no longer the only company making cubes. There are now dozens of companies making their own cubes, with improved technology to allow faster solving. This has helped to launch speedcubing onto the global scene, not only as a sport and hobby, but a worldwide business.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Solving methods==\nThe standard [[Rubik's Cube|3x3x3]] can be solved using a number of methods, not all of which are intended for speedcubing. Although some methods (such as CFOP) employ a layer-by-layer system and algorithms, other significant (though less widely used) methods include corners-first methods and the [[Gilles Roux|Roux]] method. [[CFOP method]], Roux, ZZ, and [[Lars Petrus|Petrus]] are often referred to as the \"big four\" methods, as they are the most popular and can be used to achieve faster times than the others. The [[CFOP method]] is used by most speedcubers.\n\n===CFOP method===\n{{main article|CFOP method}}\nThe CFOP (Cross \u2013 F2L \u2013 OLL \u2013 PLL) method, also known as the [[Fridrich method]], was named after one of its inventors, [[Jessica Fridrich]], who finished second in the 2003 Rubik's Cube World Championships. While it is known as the Fridrich method, its origins are actually credited to [[David Singmaster]], who was one of the first to publish a layer by layer method of solving in 1980,<ref>{{Cite web|title = David Singmaster Solution|url = http://van-ness.com/Kurt/Hobbies/RubiksCube/3x3x3/DavidSingmasterSolution.htm|website = Van Ness Web|accessdate = 2 August 2016}}</ref> and Guus Razoux Schultz, who built upon this and developed a more efficient system for the first two layers (F2L).<ref>{{Cite web|title = Guus Razoux Schultz|url = https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Guus_Razoux_Schultz|website = Speedsolving.com Wiki|accessdate = 2 August 2016}}</ref> Jessica Fridrich then finished developing the method and published it online in 1997,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Speed Cubing|url = http://www.rubiks.com/speed-cubing|website = Rubik's Official Website|accessdate = 2 August 2016}}</ref> an event that was very influential in the revival of competitive speedcubing. The first step of the method is to solve a cross-shaped arrangement of edge pieces on the first layer. The remainder of the first layer and all of the second layer are then solved together in what are referred to as \"corner-edge pairs\", or slots. Finally, the last layer is solved in two steps \u2014 first, all of the pieces in the layer are oriented to form a solid color (but without the individual pieces always being in their correct places on the cube). This step is referred to as orientation and is usually performed with a single set of algorithms known as OLL (Orientation of Last Layer). Then, all of those pieces are permuted to their correct spots. This is also usually performed as a single set of algorithms known as PLL (Permutation of Last Layer). OLL and PLL uses 21 algorithms and 57 algorithms, respectively.\n\nThe [[CFOP method]] can be used as a less-advanced method by dividing the steps into more steps, reducing the number of algorithms you need to learn but sacrifices time. Most people start learning CFOP with 4LLL (Four-Look Last Layer), which is the less advanced, slower, and algorithm-reducing way to learn CFOP. The 4 steps are divided into Edge Orientation, Corner Orientation, Corner Permutation, and Edge Permutation. Later on, you can learn Full PLL which replaces the permutation of the edges and corners, making the solve more efficient and therefore faster. Even later, you can learn Full OLL which will replace the Orientation of the corners and edges, again making the solve faster.\n\nThe CFOP method is a widely used speedcubing method. It is an more efficient version of the Layer-By-Layer beginner's method. It is very popular due to the vast amount of resources that teach and improve upon the CFOP method. Many advanced speedcubers such as two-time Former World Champion [[Feliks Zemdegs]] have also learned additional sets of algorithms for the last slot and layer, such as Corners of Last Layer (COLL), which orients and permutes the corners when the edges are oriented.\n\n===Roux method===\nThe Roux method was invented by [[French people|French]] speedcuber [[Gilles Roux]]. The first step of the Roux method is to form a 3\u00d72\u00d71 block usually placed in the lower portion of the left layer. The second step is to create another 3\u00d72\u00d71 on the opposite side, such that each block is sharing a bottom color. The remaining four corners are then solved using a set of algorithms known as CMLL (Corners of the Last Layer, without regard to the M-slice), which leaves six edges and four centers that are solved in the last step, L6E or LSE (Last Six Edges).\n\nThis method is not as dependent on algorithm memorization as the [[Fridrich method|CFOP method]] since all but the third step is done with intuition as opposed to predefined sets of algorithms. The Roux method can be performed without rotations (unlike the CFOP method) which means it is easier to look ahead (solving a collection of pieces while at the same time looking for the solution to the next step) while solving. It is also considered one of the most efficient speedsolving methods with its average move count being in between 45 and 50 moves for experienced solvers. However, the Roux method of speedcubing has been criticized over the years because, unlike CFOP, ZZ or Petrus, Roux requires M (middle) slices to solve the LSE. Using M slice moves makes it harder to achieve higher TPS (turns per second) because the fingertricks are almost always flicks which makes it a lot harder to turn faster (although higher TPS can be achieved through practice).\n\nOne of the users of this method, [[Kian Mansour]], broke the one-handed (OH) world-record average with the time of 9.54 seconds.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCfLsh5vDt0&t=56s |title= The video of Kian Monsour breaking the 3x3 OH world Record |publisher= Kian Monsour |accessdate= 27 May 2018}}</ref>\nSean Patrick Villanueva is the first Roux user to achieve a Sub-6 average of five in competition. He also podiumed in 3x3 at Worlds 2019 (2nd Place).\n\n===ZZ method===\nThe ZZ method (short for \"Zbigniew Zborowski\") is a modern speedcubing method originally proposed by Zbigniew Zborowski in 2006. The method was designed specifically to achieve high turning speed by focusing on move ergonomics, and is the combination of a block-building method and a layer-by-layer method. The initial pre-planned step is called EOLine, and is the most distinctive hallmark of the ZZ method. It involves orienting all edges while placing two oppositely placed down-face edges aligned with the correspondingly colored center. The next step solves the remaining first two layers using only left, right, top and bottom face turns, one of the advantages of ZZ. On completion of the first two layers, the last layer's edges are all correctly oriented because of edge pre-orientation during EOLine. The last layer may be completed using a number of techniques including those used in the [[Fridrich method|CFOP method]]. An expert variant of this method (ZZ-a) allows the last layer to be completed in a single step with an average of just over 12 moves and knowledge of at least 494 algorithms.<ref name=\"Bernard Helmstetter's Move Count Statistics\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/~bh/cube/|title=Rubik's Cube: Algorithms for the last layer|publisher=Universit\u00e9 Paris 8|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Petrus method===\nThe Petrus method, named after its inventor [[Lars Petrus]], is considered to be more intuitive than the structured [[Fridrich method|CFOP method]]. The first step of the Petrus method is to solve a 2\u00d72\u00d72 block of the cube. This block is then extended to a solved 2\u00d72\u00d73 block. All edges that are unoriented are then oriented, and then the first and second layers are completed using only turns of the right layer and the upper layer. Next, the top corners are put in the right place and the layer is oriented correctly (all stickers facing up) and finally the last edges are permuted (moved around). [[Lars Petrus]] developed this method to address what he felt were inherent inefficiencies in layer-by-layer approaches.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://lar5.com/cube/|title=Solving Rubik's Cube for speed|last=Petrus|first=Lars|accessdate=13 Jan 2017}}</ref> This method is often used as the basis of a method for fewest moves competitions.\n\n===Corners-first methods===\nCorners-first methods involve solving the corners then finishing the edges with slice turns. Corners-first solutions were common in the 1980s, and was one of the most popular methods that 1982 world champion [[Minh Thai]] used. Currently corners-first solutions are rarely used among speedsolvers. [[Dutch people|Dutch]] cuber Marc Waterman created a corners-first method in the cube craze, and averaged 18 seconds in the mid-late 1980s.\n\n==Competitions==\n[[File:Estonian Open 2009 - Anssi Vanhala.JPG|thumb|Anssi Vanhala solving a 3\u00d73\u00d73 Rubik's Cube with his feet in 36.72 seconds, at the 2009 Estonian Open.]]\n\n===World Cube Association===\nSince 2003, speedcubing competitions have been held regularly. The [[World Cube Association]] (WCA) was formed in 2004 to govern all official competitions. For a competition to be official, it must be approved by the WCA and follow the WCA regulations. Included in the regulations is the necessity of having one or more [[World Cube Association#WCA Delegates|WCA delegate]] in attendance. A delegate's main role is to ensure all regulations are followed during the competition. Once the competition has finished, the results are uploaded on to the WCA [[website]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Format===\nThe majority of puzzle competitions are held using a [[Truncated mean|trimmed mean]] of 5 format. This involves the competitor executing 5 solves in the round in question, after which the fastest and slowest solve are disregarded and the [[mean]] of the remaining 3 is used. The 6\u00d76\u00d76 and 7\u00d77\u00d77 events are ranked by straight mean of 3\u200a\u2014\u200aonly three solves, none of which are disregarded. In 3\u00d73\u00d73 blindfolded and 3\u00d73\u00d73 fewest moves challenges, either straight mean of 3 or best of 3 is used, while 4\u00d74\u00d74 blindfolded, 5\u00d75\u00d75 blindfolded, and multiple blindfolded challenges are ranked using best of 1, 2 or 3, depending on the competition.\n\nWhen a round begins, competitors hand in the puzzle they will use. Puzzles are scrambled using a computer-generated scramble. Each round, five, three or one (depending on the format, mentioned above) scrambles are used. Every competitor in the round will receive each scramble once. Before starting a solve, a competitor has up to 15 seconds to inspect the puzzle (inspection is removed for blindfolded events). This is monitored by a judge with a stopwatch. Once the solve is complete, the judge records the time on the competitor's scorecard and it is signed by both. If the puzzle is unsolved and the timer is stopped, the time is recorded as \"DNF\" (Did Not Finish). There are also numerous reasons why the solve can receive a two-second addition to the solve time, such as a face being more than 45 degrees off, or the competitor going over the allowed inspection time. A competitor can also receive an extra solve to replace the one just completed, for example having a timer malfunction or being deliberately distracted by another person.\n\nThe official timer used in competitions is the [[StackMat timer]]. This device has touch-sensitive pads that are triggered by the user lifting one or both of their hands to start the time and placing both their hands back on the pads after releasing the puzzle to stop the timer.\n\nOfficial competitions are currently being held in several categories.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

For a more complete list of speedcubing terminology, see the [http://www.cubefreak.net/other/glossary.php cubefreak.net glossary].\n\n;{{visible anchor|1LLL}} : A set of 3915 algorithms to solve every possible state that the last layer could be in after completing F2L.  The average move count is 12.58.\n;[[Algorithm]] : A predefined sequence of moves used to effect a specific change on the cube. Often referred to as ''alg'' or (less commonly) an ''algo''.\n;BLD : Blindfolded solving, i.e. memorize, put on blindfold, then solve.\n;Center piece : One of the centers of the faces of the cube. The centers never move relative to each other on an NxNxN cube, where N is odd. On NxNxN cubes where N>3, every piece with only one sticker is referred to as a 'center piece', including those pieces that can move relative to each other.\n;CLL : Corners of the Last Layer. This is the first of two steps of one of the methods of solving the last layer of the cube. In the process, edges may be unoriented. This is used in Corners First methods for the last layer, in which first all corners are solved, followed by the edges (see ELL). CLL is also commonly used to solve the last layer of a 2x2x2 cube in one step.\n;[[Commutator]] : A commutator is a sequence of the form X Y X' Y' (also represented as [X:Y] or [X,Y]) which affects only specific portions of the cube, leaving the rest untouched. This is used in Blindfolded solving and Fewest Moves Competition.\n;Corner piece : One of the 8 pieces with exactly three stickers, called a \"corner\" piece because a corner is exposed.\n;CR : Short for Continental Record (e.g. Record for a continent). Can also be \"Continental Rank\" when referring to the rank of a person's record in a database.\n;Cuber : Someone who solves a Rubik's cube, any of its other sizes, and/or other shaped puzzles.\n;{{visible anchor|Cubie}} : One of the mechanically independent pieces that make up a puzzle. The cubies do not include fixed center pieces, the central axis to which they are attached, or any other internal pieces (Such as the internal edges of a 4x4 or 2x2).\n;Cycle : To rotate pieces' positions on the cube. e.g. a 3-cycle would make cubie set A-B-C become C-A-B.\n;{{visible anchor|DNF}} : Initialism for Did Not Finish, used in competitions and self-timing. e.g. when a piece pop occurs and the competitor decides not to continue solving the puzzle, or when the solver stops the timer and the puzzle is 2 or more turns away from being solved.\n;{{visible anchor|DNS}} : Did Not Start, used in competition when the competitor does not begin a solve, either by opting to skip it (common in Blindfold Cubing), by not showing up when he or she is called, or not qualifying for the remaining (usually three) solves of a certain round.\n;Edge piece : One of the 12 pieces with exactly two stickers, called an \"edge\" piece because only one edge is exposed.\n;{{visible anchor|ELL}} : Edges of the Last Layer. The second of two steps of one of the methods of solving the last layer of the cube, solving the edge pieces without disturbing the corner pieces (see CLL).\n;{{visible anchor|EPLL}} : Edge Permutation of the Last Layer, specifically refers to the PLL cases in which only edges must be permuted to solve the cube.\n;Explode : When, during a solve, multiple cubies come out of contact with the puzzle, usually causing the puzzle to be unstable, in which, upon turning, more pieces may become loose and possibly pop out too.\n;{{visible anchor|F2B}} : First two blocks. This is used in the Roux method.\n;F2L : First two layers. This is used in the CFOP (Fridrich), Petrus, and ZZ methods.\n;Layer : One section of a cube consisting of a number of cubies that turn as a unit. (e.g. A standard [[Rubik's Cube]] has 3 ''layers''.)\n;LL : Last Layer. Usually refers to the top layer of the cube, but for the Roux method can refer to the middle layer between the left and right faces.\n;Method : A combination of steps that can be used to solve a cube.\n;Move : A turn of one of the sides of a puzzle or knobs in the case of the clock.\n;''N''-look, also known as ''X''-Look: Refers to the maximum number of iterations of algorithms necessary to complete a step in a particular solving method, often the last layer, e.g. '4-look LL'.\n;NR : Short for National Record (e.g. a record for a country). Can also be \"National Rank\" when referring to the rank of a person's record in a database.\n;OH : Short for One-Handed, it is the event or practice of solving a cube with one hand, left or right.\n;OLL : Orientation of the Last Layer, usually used in reference to the respective step of the CFOP and ZZ methods.\n;{{visible anchor|OLLCP}} : Orientation of the Last Layer with Corner Permutation.  An advanced technique where multiple algorithms are learned for one OLL case, in order to use one that will solve the case while also permuting the corners, which results in an easy PLL case.\n;Orient : To change the orientation of a piece.\n;PB :Personal Best \u2013 personal record time to solve a puzzle. This can either be a single attempt or a [[Truncated mean|trimmed average]], depending on context.\n;'''PR''' :Personal Record \u2013 the personal record time to solve a puzzle achieved in competition.\n;[[Permutation|Permute]] : To relocate certain pieces in a way to achieve the desired result.\n;PLL : Permutation of the Last Layer. Usually used in reference to the respective step of the [[CFOP method|CFOP]] and ZZ methods, in which case it would follow the OLL step.\n;Pop : When, during a solve, one or more cubies come out of contact with the puzzle, usually causing the puzzle to be unstable, in which, upon turning, more pieces may become loose and possibly pop out too.\n;Prime : A counter-clockwise move popularly denoted with a ', e.g. 'R-Prime', denoted as R', R-, <math>R^{-1}</math>, or Ri. Also (less commonly) known as \"inverse\" or \"inverted\".\n;Slice : The four center pieces and four edge pieces between two opposite layers of the cube.  On a cube with four or more layers, it refers to any of the layers of the puzzle that don't have corner pieces. Also refers '/' moves in Square-1 puzzles.\n;{{visible anchor|Stickerless}} : A puzzle that uses colored plastic instead of stickers to indicate color. Most stickerless puzzles were forbidden in competitions prior to a 2015 update of WCA regulations. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/thewca/wca-regulations/compare/official-2014-04-03...official-2015-07-01?short_path=7487711|title=Comparing official-2014-04-03...official-2015-07-01 \u00b7 thewca/wca-regulations|publisher=World Cube Association|accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref>\n;{{visible anchor|Summer Variation}} : A subset of algorithms for F2L that allows the user to force all upper-face corners to be oriented correctly, or an OLL-Skip, while the last F2L pair can be solved with R U R' or L' U' L.\n;SQ-1 : Abbreviation for Square-1. Sometimes used as 'Squan'.\n;{{visible anchor|TPS}} : Turns per second \u2013 the number count of turns per second indicating how fast the cuber turns.\n;Two-Second Penalty, also known as +2 : A penalty of 2 seconds which is added to a solving time in official competitions when the cube is placed back on the timing pad with one or more faces misaligned 45 degrees or more. It can also be given in other cases, such as when the competitor starts the timer too slow or does not correctly stop the timer after finishing the solve.\n;UWR :Unofficial World Record.\n\n;{{visible anchor|VLS}} : Valk Last Slot. A set of 432 algorithms (216 if mirrors are not counted), that solves together the last F2L pair and all of OLL when this last F2L pair is already joined.\n;'''WCA''' : [[World Cube Association]], the international governing body for official cube competitions.\n;{{visible anchor|Winter Variation}}, also known as WV :A subset of algorithms for VLS that allows the user to force all upper-face corners to be oriented correctly, or an OLL-Skip, while the last F2L pair is already formed. It is used when the last F2L pair (One corner and its corresponding edge correctly positioned relative to each other) to be inserted is in the top layer, with the 3 top-layer edges oriented correctly. There are a total of 27 cases. WV has an average lower move count than the standard OLL.\n;WR :World Record.\n;{{visible anchor|X-Cross}} : Completing one or multiple F2L pairs during the cross setup, used almost exclusively in the CFOP method.\n;YTUWR : YouTube Unofficial World Record, the fastest of something that is posted on YouTube.\n;{{visible anchor|ZBLL}} :ZBLL is a set of 177 algorithms (Not including mirrors and inverses) with 494 cases to recognize in order to solve the last layer in one look while all of the top edges are oriented with an average move count of ~12.08. Can be used in any layer-by-layer method that ends in N-Look LL, but will only really be efficient in ZZ and Petrus, as these methods keep edges oriented, whereas methods such as CFOP do not keep the edges oriented, becoming a sometimes 2LLL solve.\n\n==See also==\n*[[World Cube Association]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.speedsolving.com/ Speedsolving.com]\n*[http://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page Speedsolving.com Wiki]\n*[http://ws2.binghamton.edu/fridrich/system.html Fridrich Method]\n*[http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Intro.html Roux Method]\n*[http://cube.crider.co.uk/ ZZ Method]\n*[https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/ World Cube Association]\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n[[Category:Mechanical puzzles]]\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "name_user": "Changasaurus", "label": "safe", "comment": "World championships table", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing"}

The June 1985 cover portrait of the presumed to be 12-year-old Afghan girl [[Sharbat Gula]], shot by photographer [[Steve McCurry]], became one of the magazine's most recognizable images.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n''[[National Geographic Kids]]'', the children's version of the magazine, was launched in 1975 under the name ''National Geographic World''. From the 1970s through about 2010, the magazine was printed in [[Corinth, Mississippi]], by private printers until that plant was finally closed.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn the late 1990s, the magazine began publishing ''The Complete National Geographic'', a digital compilation of all the past issues of the magazine. It was then sued over copyright of the magazine as a [[collective work (US)|collective work]] in ''[[Greenberg v.

The magazine printed articles on Berlin, [[Austrian State Treaty|de-occupied Austria]], the [[Soviet Union]], and Communist China that deliberately downplayed politics to focus on culture.  In its coverage of the [[Space Race]], ''National Geographic'' focused on the scientific achievement while largely avoiding reference to the race's connection to nuclear arms buildup. There were also many articles in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s about the individual states and their resources, along with supplement maps of each state. Many of these articles were written by longtime staff such as [[Frederick Simpich]].<ref>''The Complete National Geographic''. {{ISBN|978-1-4262-9635-2}}.</ref> There were also articles about biology and science topics.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn later years{{when|date=September 2019}}, articles became outspoken on issues such as [[Environmentalism|environmental issues]], [[deforestation]], [[chemical]] [[pollution]], [[global warming]], and [[endangered species]].{{fact|date=September 2019}} Series of articles were included focusing on the history and varied uses of specific products such as a single metal, gem, food crop, or agricultural product, or an archaeological discovery. Occasionally an entire month's issue would be devoted to a single country, past civilization, a natural resource whose future is endangered, or other theme. In recent decades, the National Geographic Society has unveiled [[National Geographic Society#Publications|other magazines]] with different focuses. Whereas in the past, the magazine featured lengthy expositions, recent issues have shorter articles.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Photography==\n[[File:Taj Mahal 1921.JPG|thumb|Color photograph of the [[Taj Mahal]]. Source: ''The National Geographic Magazine'', March 1921]]\n\nIn addition to being well known for articles about scenery, history, and the most distant corners of the world, the magazine has been recognized for its book-like quality and its standard of photography. It was during the tenure of Society President [[Alexander Graham Bell]] and editor Gilbert H. Grosvenor (GHG) that the significance of illustration was first emphasized, in spite of criticism from some of the Board of Managers who considered the many illustrations an indicator of an \u201cunscientific\u201d conception of geography. By 1910, photographs had become the magazine\u2019s trademark and Grosvenor was constantly on the search for \"dynamical pictures\" as Graham Bell called them, particularly those that provided a sense of motion in a still image. In 1915, GHG began building the group of staff photographers and providing them with advanced tools including the latest darkroom.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cosmosclub.org/web/journals/1998/wentzel.html |title=GILBERT HOVEY GROSVENOR, FATHER OF PHOTOJOURNALISM |last=Wentzel |first=Volmar K |date=1998 |website=Cosmos Club |publisher=Cosmos Club |access-date=January 18, 2015 |quote=Photographs had unquestionably become the Magazine\u2019s trademark.

During the mid-1930s, [[Luis Marden]] (1913\u20132003), a writer and photographer for ''National Geographic'', convinced the magazine to allow its photographers to use the so-called \"miniature\" 35&nbsp;mm Leica cameras loaded with [[Kodachrome]] film over bulkier cameras with heavy [[photographic plate|glass plates]] that required the use of [[Tripod (photography)|tripod]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cosmosclub.org/web/journals/1998/wentzel.html |title=GILBERT HOVEY GROSVENOR, FATHER OF PHOTOJOURNALISM |last=Wentzel |first=Volmar K |date=1998 |website=Cosmos Club |publisher=Cosmos Club |access-date=January 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224164240/http://www.cosmosclub.org/web/journals/1998/wentzel.html |archive-date=February 24, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 1959, the magazine started publishing small photographs on its covers, later becoming larger photographs.  National Geographic photography quickly shifted to digital photography for both its printed magazine and its website. In subsequent years, the cover, while keeping its yellow border, shed its oak leaf trim and bare table of contents, to allow for a full page photograph taken for one of the month's articles. Issues of ''National Geographic'' are often kept by subscribers for years and re-sold at thrift stores as collectibles. The standard for photography has remained high over the subsequent decades and the magazine is still illustrated with some of the highest-quality [[photojournalism]] in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/125/photo-galleries/ |title=Milestone Photos |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2013 |website=Photo Galleries - Celebrating 125 Years |publisher=National Geographic Society |access-date=January 18, 2016}}</ref> In 2006, ''National Geographic'' began an international photography competition, with over eighteen countries participating.<ref>{{cite web |title=Named The Best Travel Photos Of The Year, And They Are Stunning |url=http://digg.com/2018/nat-geo-travel-photo-contest-winner |publisher=Digg.com |accessdate=29 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn conservative Muslim countries like [[Iran]] and [[Malaysia]], photographs featuring topless or scantily clad members of primitive tribal societies are often [[censorship|blacked out]]; buyers and subscribers often complain that this practice decreases the artistic value of the photographs for which National Geographic is world-renowned.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery>\nFile:Srirangam 1909.jpg|[[Srirangam|Srirangam Temple]], India (''National Geographic Magazine'' November 1909)\nFile:Tajin1913.jpg|[[El Taj\u00edn#The Pyramid of the Niches|Pyramid of the Niches, El Taj\u00edn]] (''National Geographic Magazine'' February 1913)\nFile:ButterMakingPalestine1914.jpg|Traditional [[butter]] making in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (''National Geographic Magazine'' March 1914)\nFile:Spanish Gypsy NGM-v31-p257.jpg|Spanish Gypsy (''National Geographic Magazine'' March 1917)\nFile:Kathmandu Market 1920.jpg|[[Kathmandu]] Market (''National Geographic Magazine'' October 1920)\nFile:Bulgarian Muslims from Rhodopes (1932).jpg|[[Bulgarian Muslim]]s from [[Rhodopes]] (''National Geographic Magazine'' October 1932)\n</gallery>\n\n==Map supplements==\nSupplementing the articles, the magazine sometimes provides maps of the regions visited.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[National Geographic Maps]] (originally the Cartographic Division) became a division of the National Geographic Society in 1915.

In its coverage of the [[Space Race]], ''National Geographic'' focused on the scientific achievement while largely avoiding reference to the race's connection to nuclear arms buildup. There were also many articles in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s about the individual states and their resources, along with supplement maps of each state.

Source: ''The National Geographic Magazine'', March 1921]]\n\nIn addition to being well known for articles about scenery, history, and the most distant corners of the world, the magazine has been recognized for its book-like quality and its standard of photography. It was during the tenure of Society President [[Alexander Graham Bell]] and editor Gilbert H. Grosvenor (GHG) that the significance of illustration was first emphasized, in spite of criticism from some of the Board of Managers who considered the many illustrations an indicator of an \u201cunscientific\u201d conception of geography. By 1910, photographs had become the magazine\u2019s trademark and Grosvenor was constantly on the search for \"dynamical pictures\" as Graham Bell called them, particularly those that provided a sense of motion in a still image. In 1915, GHG began building the group of staff photographers and providing them with advanced tools including the latest darkroom.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cosmosclub.org/web/journals/1998/wentzel.html |title=GILBERT HOVEY GROSVENOR, FATHER OF PHOTOJOURNALISM |last=Wentzel |first=Volmar K |date=1998 |website=Cosmos Club |publisher=Cosmos Club |access-date=January 18, 2015 |quote=Photographs had unquestionably become the Magazine\u2019s trademark.

During the mid-1930s, [[Luis Marden]] (1913\u20132003), a writer and photographer for ''National Geographic'', convinced the magazine to allow its photographers to use the so-called \"miniature\" 35&nbsp;mm Leica cameras loaded with [[Kodachrome]] film over bulkier cameras with heavy [[photographic plate|glass plates]] that required the use of [[Tripod (photography)|tripod]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cosmosclub.org/web/journals/1998/wentzel.html |title=GILBERT HOVEY GROSVENOR, FATHER OF PHOTOJOURNALISM |last=Wentzel |first=Volmar K |date=1998 |website=Cosmos Club |publisher=Cosmos Club |access-date=January 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224164240/http://www.cosmosclub.org/web/journals/1998/wentzel.html |archive-date=February 24, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 1959, the magazine started publishing small photographs on its covers, later becoming larger photographs.  National Geographic photography quickly shifted to digital photography for both its printed magazine and its website. In subsequent years, the cover, while keeping its yellow border, shed its oak leaf trim and bare table of contents, to allow for a full page photograph taken for one of the month's articles. Issues of ''National Geographic'' are often kept by subscribers for years and re-sold at thrift stores as collectibles.
