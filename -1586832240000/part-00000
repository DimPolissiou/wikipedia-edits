It was released on November 19, 2002 by [[Arista Records]] as the album's third single. The song was Lavigne's first ballad released as a single. It was the second Lavigne song to be nominated for a Grammy in the categories [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] at the [[2004 Grammy Awards]].\n\nThe song reached number four on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], as well as reaching the top ten in nine other countries, thus making it Lavigne's third single to reach the top ten. \"I'm with You\" received radio and television airplay in Australia, but it was not officially released there.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nThe song received critical acclaim from music critics. The arrangement of singles from ''Let Go'', with \"I'm with You\" as the third, was regarded as \"controversial choices\", given that \"I'm with You\" was \"thought by some to be the biggest potential smash on the album\", and could have established Lavigne as a more mature artist if it was released first. According to Reid, \"Some people just really didn't get that. And with the first video, there was some concern that maybe because it's so young and so playful, it might alienate more serious music lovers.\"{{r|WillmanBoy}} [[KidsWorld]] called it \"the perfect song to drown your sorrows to when that guy from your class breaks your heart.\"{{r|kidsworld}}\n\n===Chart performance===\n\"I'm with You\" became Lavigne's third top 10 song when it peaked at number four on [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 2003 during its ninth week on the chart.{{r|bb100}} The song spent ten consecutive weeks on the top 10 and twenty-seven weeks on the Hot 100 making it Lavigne's second-longest staying song on this chart, surpassed by her debut single \"[[Complicated (Avril Lavigne song)|Complicated]]\" which stayed on the chart for 31 weeks.{{r|bblistings|bbhistory}} \"I'm with You\" ranked at number 18 on the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 2003|''Billboard'' Year-End Hot 100 singles of 2003]] and number 13 on the [[Canadian Singles Chart]].{{r|vnuemedia}} The song was certified gold by [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in 2006 for sales of over 500,000 copies in the United States.{{r|RIAA}} As of July 2013, ''I'm with You'' had sold 556,000 digital copies in the US.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/1569263/ask-billboard-why-do-some-songs-fade-out-and-others-end-cold?page=0%2C3 |title=Sales updates on Avril Lavigne |publisher=Billboard |date=5 July 2013 |accessdate=9 July 2013}}</ref> As a double A-side [[DVD single]], the \"I'm with You\"/\"[[Sk8er Boi]]\" video single was certified gold and platinum in 2003.{{r|RIAA}}\n\nIn United Kingdom, \"I'm with You\" was released on March 31, 2003.

Showing her originally at a party, the video also sees Lavigne pushing a guy when he tries to get with her straight after making out with another woman. Most of the video is shown in slow motion but Lavigne's mouth movements are in sync with the song's vocals. This was achieved by recording the footage while the song was played twice as fast. The video also sees Lavigne walking on the streets and wearing a black jacket. Through the video, she is seen standing behind a snowy bank. At the end of the video, Lavigne walks out of the club with her coat on, kicks out the door and walks away. [[Much Music]] named the video one of the \"Top 100 Best Videos of All Time\".{{r|mmusic}} The music video was originally meant to end with Lavigne walking out of the club to her bandmates, who then greet her and walk off together into the distance, but this ending was removed during post-production, ending the video with her leaving alone.<ref>{{cite web|title=Avril Lavigne - Making of I'm With You (B Roll) 8/11/2002|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp5IgPvdFcs}}</ref> An alternative version of the video leaked online to the internet, comprising alternate shots, slightly longer sequences and featuring the originally filmed ending.\n\nIt was at least partly filmed in [[Los Angeles]].

The song was also used in the 2003 Brazilian soap opera ''[[Mulheres Apaixonadas]]''. Furthermore, it was featured in the video game ''[[Karaoke Revolution Volume 2]]'' and in ''[[Singstar]]'' Rock Ballads. The song is also used as the background music for the [[Panasonic Lumix DMC-G85/G80]] commercial, with [[Jennifer Garner]] and [[Cate Blanchett]]. It also appears in the 2003 film [[Bruce Almighty]].\n\n[[Rihanna]] sampled the song on her track \"[[Cheers (Drink to That)]]\", which was released as a single. Lavigne made an appearance in the music video.{{r|digitalspy|artistdirect}} Polish-Czech singer [[Ewa Farna]] covered the song and it was featured as a track on her album ''[[M\u011bls m\u011b v\u016fbec r\u00e1d]]''.\n\n[[Sophie Evans (performer)|Sophie Evans]] covered the song in Week 3 of ''[[Over the Rainbow (2010 TV series)|Over the Rainbow]]''.

It was released on November 19, 2002 by [[Arista Records]] as the album's third single. The song was Lavigne's first ballad released as a single. It was the second Lavigne song to be nominated for a Grammy in the categories [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] at the [[2004 Grammy Awards]].\n\nThe song reached number four on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], as well as reaching the top ten in nine other countries, thus making it Lavigne's third single to reach the top ten. \"I'm with You\" received radio and television airplay in Australia, but it was not officially released there.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nThe song received critical acclaim from music critics. The arrangement of singles from ''Let Go'', with \"I'm with You\" as the third, was regarded as \"controversial choices\", given that \"I'm with You\" was \"thought by some to be the biggest potential smash on the album\", and could have established Lavigne as a more mature artist if it was released first. According to Reid, \"Some people just really didn't get that. And with the first video, there was some concern that maybe because it's so young and so playful, it might alienate more serious music lovers.\"{{r|WillmanBoy}} [[KidsWorld]] called it \"the perfect song to drown your sorrows to when that guy from your class breaks your heart.\"{{r|kidsworld}}\n\n===Chart performance===\n\"I'm with You\" became Lavigne's third top 10 song when it peaked at number four on [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 2003 during its ninth week on the chart.{{r|bb100}} The song spent ten consecutive weeks on the top 10 and twenty-seven weeks on the Hot 100 making it Lavigne's second-longest staying song on this chart, surpassed by her debut single \"[[Complicated (Avril Lavigne song)|Complicated]]\" which stayed on the chart for 31 weeks.{{r|bblistings|bbhistory}} \"I'm with You\" ranked at number 18 on the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 2003|''Billboard'' Year-End Hot 100 singles of 2003]] and number 13 on the [[Canadian Singles Chart]].{{r|vnuemedia}} The song was certified gold by [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in 2006 for sales of over 500,000 copies in the United States.{{r|RIAA}} As of July 2013, ''I'm with You'' had sold 556,000 digital copies in the US.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/1569263/ask-billboard-why-do-some-songs-fade-out-and-others-end-cold?page=0%2C3 |title=Sales updates on Avril Lavigne |publisher=Billboard |date=5 July 2013 |accessdate=9 July 2013}}</ref> As a double A-side [[DVD single]], the \"I'm with You\"/\"[[Sk8er Boi]]\" video single was certified gold and platinum in 2003.{{r|RIAA}}\n\nIn United Kingdom, \"I'm with You\" was released on March 31, 2003.

Showing her originally at a party, the video also sees Lavigne pushing a guy when he tries to get with her straight after making out with another woman. Most of the video is shown in slow motion but Lavigne's mouth movements are in sync with the song's vocals. This was achieved by recording the footage while the song was played twice as fast. The video also sees Lavigne walking on the streets and wearing a black jacket. Through the video, she is seen standing behind a snowy bank. At the end of the video, Lavigne walks out of the club with her coat on, kicks out the door and walks away. [[Much Music]] named the video one of the \"Top 100 Best Videos of All Time\".{{r|mmusic}} The music video was originally meant to end with Lavigne walking out of the club to her bandmates, who then greet her and walk off together into the distance, but this ending was removed during post-production, ending the video with her leaving alone.<ref>{{cite web|title=Avril Lavigne - Making of I'm With You (B Roll) 8/11/2002|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp5IgPvdFcs}}</ref> An alternative version of the video leaked online to the internet, comprising alternate shots, slightly longer sequences and featuring the originally filmed ending.\n\nIt was at least partly filmed in [[Los Angeles]].

The song was also used in the 2003 Brazilian soap opera ''[[Mulheres Apaixonadas]]''. Furthermore, it was featured in the video game ''[[Karaoke Revolution Volume 2]]'' and in ''[[Singstar]]'' Rock Ballads. The song is also used as the background music for the [[Panasonic Lumix DMC-G85/G80]] commercial, with [[Jennifer Garner]] and [[Cate Blanchett]]. It also appears in the 2003 film [[Bruce Almighty]].\n\n[[Rihanna]] sampled the song on her track \"[[Cheers (Drink to That)]]\", which was released as a single. Lavigne made an appearance in the music video.{{r|digitalspy|artistdirect}} Polish-Czech singer [[Ewa Farna]] covered the song and it was featured as a track on her album ''[[M\u011bls m\u011b v\u016fbec r\u00e1d]]''.\n\n[[Sophie Evans (performer)|Sophie Evans]] covered the song in Week 3 of ''[[Over the Rainbow (2010 TV series)|Over the Rainbow]]''.

The origins of the term are found in [[Ancient Greece]]. In the [[Athenian democracy]], the [[public opinion]] of voters was influenced by the [[political satire]] performed by the [[comic poets]] at the [[Ancient Greek theatre|theaters]].<ref>Henderson, J. (1993) ''Comic Hero versus Political Elite'' pp. 307\u201319 in {{cite book |editor1=Sommerstein, A.H. |editor2=S. Halliwell |editor3=J. Henderson |editor4=B. Zimmerman |title=Tragedy, Comedy and the Polis |year=1993 |publisher=Levante Editori |location=Bari}}</ref> The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing [[agon]] or conflict. [[Northrop Frye]] depicted these two opposing sides as a \"Society of Youth\" and a \"Society of the Old.\"<ref>([[Anatomy of Criticism]], 1957)</ref> A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic [[irony]] which provokes [[laughter]].<ref>Marteinson, 2006</ref>\n\n[[Satire]] and [[political satire]] use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor. [[Parody]] subverts popular genres and forms, critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them.\n\nOther forms of comedy include [[screwball comedy]], which derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising (and improbable) situations or characters, and [[black comedy]], which is characterized by a form of humor that includes darker aspects of human behavior or human nature.  Similarly [[Toilet humor|scatological humor]], sexual humor, and [[ethnic joke|race humor]] create comedy by violating [[Convention (norm)|social conventions]] or [[taboo]]s in comic ways. A [[comedy of manners]] typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper-class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. [[Romantic comedy]] is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File: Tragic comic masks - roman mosaic.jpg|thumb|Tragic Comic Masks of [[Theatre of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek Theatre]]\nrepresented in the  [[Hadrian's Villa]] mosaic]]\nThe word \"comedy\" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] \u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 ''k\u014dm\u014did\u00eda'', which is a compound of [[komos|\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2]] ''k\u00f4mos'' (revel) and \u1fa0\u03b4\u03ae ''\u014did\u1e17'' (singing).<ref>[https://www.etymonline.com/word/comedy ] \"The old derivation from ''kome'' \"village\" is not now regarded.\"</ref> The adjective \"comic\" (Greek \u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ''k\u014dmik\u00f3s),'' which strictly means that which relates to comedy is, in modern usage, generally confined to the sense of \"laughter-provoking\".<ref name = \"Cornford1934pn\">Cornford (1934){{Page needed|date=June 2011}}</ref> Of this, the word came into modern usage through the Latin ''comoedia'' and Italian ''commedia'' and has, over time, passed through various shades of meaning.<ref name = OED>Oxford English Dictionary</ref>\n\nThe [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] confined their use of the [[word]] \"comedy\" to descriptions of stage-plays with happy endings. [[Aristotle]] defined comedy as an imitation of men worse than the average (where [[tragedy]] was an imitation of men better than the average). However, the characters portrayed in comedies were not worse than average in every way, only insofar as they are Ridiculous, which is a species of the Ugly. The Ridiculous may be defined as a mistake or deformity not productive of pain or harm to others; the mask, for instance, that excites laughter is something ugly and distorted without causing pain.<ref>[[Richard McKeon|McKeon, Richard]]. ''The Basic Works Of Aristotle'', the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 2001, p. 1459.</ref> In the [[Middle Ages]], the term expanded to include narrative poems with happy endings.  It is in this sense that [[Dante]] used the term in the title of his poem, ''[[The Divine Comedy|La Commedia]]''.\n\nAs time progressed, the word came more and more to be associated with any sort of performance intended to cause laughter.<ref name = OED/> During the Middle Ages, the term \"comedy\" became synonymous with [[satire]], and later with [[humour]] in general.\n\nAristotle's [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']] was translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], where it was elaborated upon by [[Arabic literature|Arabic writers]] and [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]], such as Abu Bischr, and his pupils [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]]. They disassociated comedy from [[Greek drama]]tic representation and instead identified it with [[Arabic poetry|Arabic poetic]] themes and forms, such as ''[[hija]]'' (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the \"art of reprehension\", and made no reference to light and cheerful events, or to the troubling beginnings and happy endings associated with classical Greek comedy.\n\nAfter the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]], the term \"comedy\" gained a more general meaning in [[medieval literature]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/470561|title=Comedy as Satire in Hispano-Arabic Spain|first=Edwin J.|jstor=470561|last=Webber|journal=Hispanic Review|volume=26|issue=1|date=January 1958|pages=1\u201311}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, many scholars preferred to use the term ''[[laughter]]'' to refer to the whole [[gamut]] of the comic, in order to avoid the use of ambiguous and problematically defined genres such as the [[grotesque]], [[irony]], and [[satire]].<ref>Herman Braet, Guido Latr\u00e9, Werner Verbeke (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6mqDEpy0YUsC&pg=PA1 ''Risus mediaevalis: laughter in medieval literature and art''] p.1 quotation: {{quotation|The deliberate use by Menard of the term 'le rire' rather than 'l'humour' reflects accurately the current evidency to incorporate all instances of the comic in the analysis, while the classification in genres and fields such as grotesque, humour and even irony or satire always poses problems.

For Aristotle, a comedy did not need to involve sexual humor.  A comedy is about the fortunate rise of a sympathetic character. Aristotle divides comedy into three categories or subgenres:  [[farce]], [[romantic comedy]], and [[satire]].  On the contrary, [[Plato]] taught that comedy is a destruction to the self. He believed that it produces an emotion that overrides rational self-control and learning. In ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', he says that the guardians of the state should avoid laughter, \"for ordinarily when one abandons himself to violent laughter, his condition provokes a violent reaction.\" Plato says comedy should be tightly controlled if one wants to achieve the ideal state.\n\nAlso in ''Poetics'', Aristotle defined comedy as one of the original four genres of [[literature]]. The other three genres are [[tragedy]], [[epic poetry]], and [[lyric poetry]]. Literature, in general, is defined by Aristotle as a [[mimesis]], or imitation of life. Comedy is the third form of literature, being the most divorced from a true mimesis. Tragedy is the truest mimesis, followed by epic poetry, comedy, and lyric poetry. The genre of comedy is defined by a certain pattern according to Aristotle's definition. Comedies begin with low or base characters seeking insignificant aims and end with some accomplishment of the aims which either lightens the initial baseness or reveals the insignificance of the aims.\n\n====Early Renaissance forms of comedy====\n{{main|Divine Comedy|Dante}}\nThe ''Divine Comedy'' ({{lang-it|Divina Commedia}} {{IPA-it|di\u02c8vi\u02d0na kom\u02c8m\u025b\u02d0dja|}}) is a long [[Narrative poetry|narrative poem]] by [[Dante Alighieri]], begun c. 1308 and completed in 1320, a year before his death in 1321.

Constructions of surreal humour tend to involve bizarre juxtapositions, incongruity, [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequiturs]], irrational or absurd situations and expressions of [[nonsense]].<ref name=stockwell>{{cite book|last1=Stockwell|first1=Peter|title=The Language of Surrealism|page=177|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KZhNDQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA177&dq=Surreal%20humour&pg=PA177#v=onepage&q=Surreal%20humour&f=false|isbn=978-1-137-39219-0|date=2016-11-01}}</ref> The humour arises from a subversion of audience's expectations, so that amusement is founded on [[predictability|unpredictability]], separate from a logical analysis of the situation. The humour derived gets its appeal from the ridiculousness and unlikeliness of the situation. The genre has roots in [[Surrealism]] in the arts.<ref name=stockwell/>\n\n[[File:Edward Lear and His Cat Foss 1885.jpg|thumb|''Edward Lear, Aged 73 and a Half and His Cat Foss, Aged 16'', an 1885 lithograph by [[Edward Lear]]]]\nSurreal humour is the effect of [[logic|illogic]] and [[absurdity]] being used for humorous effect. Under such premises, people can identify precursors and early examples of surreal humour at least since the 19th century, such as [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'', which both use illogic and absurdity ([[hookah]]-smoking [[caterpillars]], [[croquet]] matches using live [[flamingos]] as mallets, etc.) for humorous effect. Many of [[Edward Lear]]'s children stories and poems contain [[literary nonsense|nonsense]] and are basically surreal in approach. For example, ''The Story of the Four Little Children Who Went Round the World'' (1871) is filled with contradictory statements and odd images intended to provoke amusement, such as the following:\n{{quote|After a time they saw some land at a distance; and when they came to it, they found it was an island made of water quite surrounded by earth.

[[Charlie Chaplin]], through silent film, became one of the best-known faces on Earth. The silent tradition lived on well into the 20th century through mime artists like [[Marcel Marceau]], and the physical comedy of artists like [[Rowan Atkinson]] as [[Mr. Bean]]. The tradition of the circus clown also continued, with such as [[Bozo the Clown]] in the United States and [[Oleg Popov]] in Russia. Radio provided new possibilities \u2014 with Britain producing the influential [[surreal humour]] of the [[Goon Show]] after the Second World War. The Goons' influence spread to the American radio and [[audio recording|recording]] troupe [[the Firesign Theatre]]. [[American cinema]] has produced a great number of globally renowned comedy artists, from [[Laurel and Hardy]], the [[Three Stooges]], [[Abbott and Costello]], [[Martin and Lewis|Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis]], as well as [[Bob Hope]] during the mid-20th century, to performers like [[George Carlin]], [[Robin Williams]], and [[Eddie Murphy]] at the end of the century. [[Hollywood]] attracted many international talents like the British comics [[Peter Sellers]], [[Dudley Moore]] and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]], Canadian comics [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Jim Carrey]], and [[Mike Myers]], and the [[Australian comedy|Australian comedian]]  [[Paul Hogan]], famous for ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]''. Other centres of creative comic activity have been the [[cinema of Hong Kong]], [[Bollywood]], and French [[farce]].\n\nAmerican television has also been an influential force in world comedy: with American series like ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' achieving large followings around the world. British television comedy also remains influential, with quintessential works including ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', [[Monty Python]], ''[[Dad's Army]]'', ''[[Blackadder]]'', and ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''. Australian satirist [[Barry Humphries]], whose comic creations include the housewife and \"gigastar\" Dame [[Edna Everage]], for his delivery of Dadaist and [[Absurdism|absurdist]] humour to millions, was described by biographer Anne Pender in 2010 as not only \"the most significant theatrical figure of our time ...

Each ''rasa'' was associated with a specific ''bhavas'' portrayed on stage. In the case of humour, it was associated with mirth (''hasya'').\n\n== Studies on comic theory ==\nThe phenomena connected with [[laughter]] and that which provokes it have been carefully investigated by psychologists. They agree the predominant characteristics are incongruity or contrast in the object and shock or emotional seizure on the part of the subject. It has also been held that the feeling of superiority is an essential factor: thus [[Thomas Hobbes]] speaks of laughter as a \"sudden glory\". Modern investigators have paid much attention to the origin both of laughter and of smiling, as well as the development of the \"play instinct\" and its emotional expression.\n\n[[George Meredith]] said that \"One excellent test of the civilization of a country ...

The different forms of comedy often overlap, and most comedy can fit into multiple genres. Some of the subgenres of comedy are [[farce]], [[comedy of manners]], [[burlesque]], and [[satire]].\n\nSome comedy apes certain cultural forms: for instance, parody and [[satire]] often imitate the conventions of the genre they are parodying or satirizing. For example, in the United States, parodies of newspapers and television news include ''[[The Onion]]'', and ''[[The Colbert Report]]''; in Australia, shows such as ''[[Kath & Kim]],'' [[Utopia (Australian TV series)|''Utopia'']], and ''[[Shaun Micallef's Mad as Hell|Shaun Micallef's Mad As Hell]]'' perform the same role.\n\n[[Self-deprecation]] is a technique of comedy used by many

Zimmerman |title=Tragedy, Comedy and the Polis |year=1993 |publisher=Levante Editori |location=Bari}}</ref> The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing [[agon]] or conflict. [[Northrop Frye]] depicted these two opposing sides as a \"Society of Youth\" and a \"Society of the Old.\"<ref>([[Anatomy of Criticism]], 1957)</ref> A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic [[irony]] which provokes [[laughter]].<ref>Marteinson, 2006</ref>\n\n[[Satire]] and [[political satire]] use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor. [[Parody]] subverts popular genres and forms, critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them.\n\nOther forms of comedy include [[screwball comedy]], which derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising (and improbable) situations or characters, and [[black comedy]], which is characterized by a form of humor that includes darker aspects of human behavior or human nature.  Similarly [[Toilet humor|scatological humor]], sexual humor, and [[ethnic joke|race humor]] create comedy by violating [[Convention (norm)|social conventions]] or [[taboo]]s in comic ways. A [[comedy of manners]] typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper-class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. [[Romantic comedy]] is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File: Tragic comic masks - roman mosaic.jpg|thumb|Tragic Comic Masks of [[Theatre of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek Theatre]]\nrepresented in the  [[Hadrian's Villa]] mosaic]]\nThe word \"comedy\" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] \u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 ''k\u014dm\u014did\u00eda'', which is a compound of [[komos|\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2]] ''k\u00f4mos'' (revel) and \u1fa0\u03b4\u03ae ''\u014did\u1e17'' (singing).<ref>[https://www.etymonline.com/word/comedy ] \"The old derivation from ''kome'' \"village\" is not now regarded.\"</ref> The adjective \"comic\" (Greek \u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ''k\u014dmik\u00f3s),'' which strictly means that which relates to comedy is, in modern usage, generally confined to the sense of \"laughter-provoking\".<ref name = \"Cornford1934pn\">Cornford (1934){{Page needed|date=June 2011}}</ref> Of this, the word came into modern usage through the Latin ''comoedia'' and Italian ''commedia'' and has, over time, passed through various shades of meaning.<ref name = OED>Oxford English Dictionary</ref>\n\nThe [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] confined their use of the [[word]] \"comedy\" to descriptions of stage-plays with happy endings. [[Aristotle]] defined comedy as an imitation of men worse than the average (where [[tragedy]] was an imitation of men better than the average). However, the characters portrayed in comedies were not worse than average in every way, only insofar as they are Ridiculous, which is a species of the Ugly. The Ridiculous may be defined as a mistake or deformity not productive of pain or harm to others; the mask, for instance, that excites laughter is something ugly and distorted without causing pain.<ref>[[Richard McKeon|McKeon, Richard]]. ''The Basic Works Of Aristotle'', the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 2001, p. 1459.</ref> In the [[Middle Ages]], the term expanded to include narrative poems with happy endings.  It is in this sense that [[Dante]] used the term in the title of his poem, ''[[The Divine Comedy|La Commedia]]''.\n\nAs time progressed, the word came more and more to be associated with any sort of performance intended to cause laughter.<ref name = OED/> During the Middle Ages, the term \"comedy\" became synonymous with [[satire]], and later with [[humour]] in general.\n\nAristotle's [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']] was translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], where it was elaborated upon by [[Arabic literature|Arabic writers]] and [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]], such as Abu Bischr, and his pupils [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]]. They disassociated comedy from [[Greek drama]]tic representation and instead identified it with [[Arabic poetry|Arabic poetic]] themes and forms, such as ''[[hija]]'' (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the \"art of reprehension\", and made no reference to light and cheerful events, or to the troubling beginnings and happy endings associated with classical Greek comedy.\n\nAfter the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]], the term \"comedy\" gained a more general meaning in [[medieval literature]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/470561|title=Comedy as Satire in Hispano-Arabic Spain|first=Edwin J.|jstor=470561|last=Webber|journal=Hispanic Review|volume=26|issue=1|date=January 1958|pages=1\u201311}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, many scholars preferred to use the term ''[[laughter]]'' to refer to the whole [[gamut]] of the comic, in order to avoid the use of ambiguous and problematically defined genres such as the [[grotesque]], [[irony]], and [[satire]].<ref>Herman Braet, Guido Latr\u00e9, Werner Verbeke (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6mqDEpy0YUsC&pg=PA1 ''Risus mediaevalis: laughter in medieval literature and art''] p.1 quotation: {{quotation|The deliberate use by Menard of the term 'le rire' rather than 'l'humour' reflects accurately the current evidency to incorporate all instances of the comic in the analysis, while the classification in genres and fields such as grotesque, humour and even irony or satire always poses problems.

For Aristotle, a comedy did not need to involve sexual humor.  A comedy is about the fortunate rise of a sympathetic character. Aristotle divides comedy into three categories or subgenres:  [[farce]], [[romantic comedy]], and [[satire]].  On the contrary, [[Plato]] taught that comedy is a destruction to the self. He believed that it produces an emotion that overrides rational self-control and learning. In ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', he says that the guardians of the state should avoid laughter, \"for ordinarily when one abandons himself to violent laughter, his condition provokes a violent reaction.\" Plato says comedy should be tightly controlled if one wants to achieve the ideal state.\n\nAlso in ''Poetics'', Aristotle defined comedy as one of the original four genres of [[literature]]. The other three genres are [[tragedy]], [[epic poetry]], and [[lyric poetry]]. Literature, in general, is defined by Aristotle as a [[mimesis]], or imitation of life. Comedy is the third form of literature, being the most divorced from a true mimesis. Tragedy is the truest mimesis, followed by epic poetry, comedy, and lyric poetry. The genre of comedy is defined by a certain pattern according to Aristotle's definition. Comedies begin with low or base characters seeking insignificant aims and end with some accomplishment of the aims which either lightens the initial baseness or reveals the insignificance of the aims.\n\n====Early Renaissance forms of comedy====\n{{main|Divine Comedy|Dante}}\nThe ''Divine Comedy'' ({{lang-it|Divina Commedia}} {{IPA-it|di\u02c8vi\u02d0na kom\u02c8m\u025b\u02d0dja|}}) is a long [[Narrative poetry|narrative poem]] by [[Dante Alighieri]], begun c. 1308 and completed in 1320, a year before his death in 1321.

[[Charlie Chaplin]], through silent film, became one of the best-known faces on Earth. The silent tradition lived on well into the 20th century through mime artists like [[Marcel Marceau]], and the physical comedy of artists like [[Rowan Atkinson]] as [[Mr. Bean]]. The tradition of the circus clown also continued, with such as [[Bozo the Clown]] in the United States and [[Oleg Popov]] in Russia. Radio provided new possibilities \u2014 with Britain producing the influential [[surreal humour]] of the [[Goon Show]] after the Second World War.

[[Hollywood]] attracted many international talents like the British comics [[Peter Sellers]], [[Dudley Moore]] and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]], Canadian comics [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Jim Carrey]], and [[Mike Myers]], and the [[Australian comedy|Australian comedian]]  [[Paul Hogan]], famous for ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]''. Other centres of creative comic activity have been the [[cinema of Hong Kong]], [[Bollywood]], and French [[farce]].\n\nAmerican television has also been an influential force in world comedy: with American series like ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' achieving large followings around the world. British television comedy also remains influential, with quintessential works including ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', [[Monty Python]], ''[[Dad's Army]]'', ''[[Blackadder]]'', and ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''.

The different forms of comedy often overlap, and most comedy can fit into multiple genres. Some of the subgenres of comedy are [[farce]], [[comedy of manners]], [[burlesque]], and [[satire]].\n\nSome comedy apes certain cultural forms: for instance, parody and [[satire]] often imitate the conventions of the genre they are parodying or satirizing. For example, in the United States, parodies of newspapers and television news include ''[[The Onion]]'', and ''[[The Colbert Report]]''; in Australia, shows such as ''[[Kath & Kim]],'' [[Utopia (Australian TV series)|''Utopia'']], and ''[[Shaun Micallef's Mad as Hell|Shaun Micallef's Mad As Hell]]'' perform the same role.\n\n[[Self-deprecation]] is a technique of comedy used by many comedians who focus on their misfortunes and foibles in order to entertain.\n\n== Performing arts ==\n{{Performing arts}}\n{{Main|Comedy (drama)}}\n\n=== Historical forms ===\n* [[Ancient Greek
