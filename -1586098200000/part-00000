It was therefore, the federal funding would be provided through the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|Office of Indian Affairs]] (OIA). Further capital was raised and provided by the [[Arizona|State of Arizona]] and [[Imperial County, California]]; each providing $25,000. OIA engineers in [[Washington D.C.]] were tasked with designing the new bridge. The new bridge design was to be a steel, Pennsylvania through truss design complemented by a Warren deck truss second span, both resting upon concrete piers and abutments above the river. The location of the bridge was to be upstream from an existing ferry crossing at Prison Hill Road.<ref name=\"ADOT01\" />\n\nThe [[Omaha Structural Steel Works]] was awarded the construction contract by the OIA in June 1914, at a cost of $73,800.

[[Falsework]] erected to aid in the bridge's construction were twice washed downstream by floods.<ref name=\"ADOT01\" /><ref name=\"YumaSun\" /> Omaha Steel decided to approach construction of the twin span bridge by a different method; constructing the spans on barges and floating each span down river into position. The {{convert|336|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} span was floated down river and swung into place carefully and methodically on March 3, 1915, followed by local praise and celebration. Following completion, the Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge was ceremoniously opened to the public on May 22, 1915. The bridge became a crucial link in the nationwide transcontinental Ocean-to-Ocean Highway and was also the first highway bridge across the lower Colorado River.<ref name=\"ADOT01\" />\n\nOn November 11, 1926, the bridge became part of [[U.S. Route 80 in Arizona|U.S. Route 80]].<ref name=\"Jensen\" /><ref name=\"FHWA\">{{cite web | url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us80.cfm | title=U.S. Route 80 The Dixie Overland Highway | publisher=Federal Highway Administration | work=Webpage | date=18 November 2015 | accessdate=1 September 2016 | author=Weingroff, Richard}}</ref> The successor to the earlier Ocean-to-Ocean Highway, US 80 became the primary east to west transcontinental highway in Arizona and between the 1920s and 1930s, carried the majority of the state's auto traffic.<ref name=\"ADOT01\" /> During the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s, the Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge was used by California state police officers to deny entry refugees of the dust bowl hailing from Oklahoma intending to find work in California. Often called \"Okies\", these people found work instead around Yuma, County between Yuma and [[Wellton, Arizona|Wellton]]. The refugees soon provided critically needed assistance to local farmers.<ref name=\"YumaSun\" /> In 1956, US 80 was re-routed off the Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge and onto a newer bridge built downstream at the foot of Fourth Avenue.<ref name=\"Jensen\" /> Following construction of the Fourth Avenue Bridge and the construction of Interstate 8 in the early 1970s, vehicular traffic and importance of the Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge steadily declined.<ref name=\"YumaSun\" /> Similarly, the historic transcontinental highway which the bridge had once carried, US 80, declined and was removed from [[San Diego]] to [[Benson, Arizona|Benson]] between 1964 and 1977, no longer running through Yuma.<ref name=\"FHWA\" /> In 1978, the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Despite the newly gained honor, vehicular traffic was no longer allowed to use the bridge after 1988. In 2001, a $3 million restoration and rehabilitation project was begun, temporarily closing the bridge to pedestrians as well. Following the extensive restoration and a re-dedication ceremony, the bridge was re-opened to traffic in 2002 and now carries Penitentiary Avenue.<ref name=\"YumaSun\" /> The Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge was

The well cylinder was the basic form used to deepen the wells. It is also inferred that the Stepwells in Gujarat have survived so long in view of the builder's knowledge of the soil conditions and the earthquake proneness of the region.<ref>Livingston p.51-52</ref>\n\nThe well size recommended, based on considerations of stability, was of four to thirteen ''[[Hasta (unit)|hasta]]'' ('hasta' a [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] word, which means  \"forearm\" of size varying from {{convert|12|-|24|in|mm}}), A size of eight ''hasta'' was considered ideal and a 13 ''hasta'' well was considered dangerous.

It was built in 1498. The history of the Adalaj step-well is established by an inscription in Sanskrit found on a marble slab positioned in a recess on the first floor, from the eastern entry to the well. Its construction was started by Rana Veer Singh of the Vaghela dynasty of Dandai Desh. But he was killed in a war, whereafter the Muslim king [[Mahmud Begada]] of a neighbouring state built it in Indo-Islamic architectural style, in 1499.<ref name=\"culture\"/><ref name=rich>{{Cite web|url=http://www.architecturecaribbean.com/adalaj_step_well.php|title=Stepping into A Rich History|accessdate=18 November 2009|publisher=Architecture Caribbean}}</ref><ref name=mona>{{Cite web|url=http://monadarling.com/lifestyle/step-wells-of-gujarat-and-rajasthan.html|title= Step-wells of Gujarat and Rajasthan|accessdate=17 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe Sanskrit inscription in the stepwell describes,<ref name=\"Burgess1874\">{{cite book|last1=Burgess|last2=Murray|title=Photographs of Architecture and Scenery in Gujarat and Rajputana|url=https://archive.org/stream/photographsofarc00murr#page/n17/mode/2up|accessdate=23 July 2016|year=1874|publisher=Bourne and Shepherd|page=17|chapter=The Rudra Mala at Siddhpur}}</ref>\n{{quote|\"Samvat 1555 (1498 AD), month of Magha, Mahmud Padshah being king.<br />\n\"Salutation to Vinayaka ([[Ganesha]]) to whose race belonged King Mokala, chief of the country of Dandahi.

His kingdom was a small one. It was subject to water shortage and was highly dependent on the rains. To alleviate the misery of his people, the Rana began the construction of a large and deep stepwell.\n\nBefore this project could be completed, his kingdom was attacked by Mohammed Begda, the Muslim ruler of a neighboring kingdom. The Rana king was killed in battle and his territory was occupied by the invader. Rana Veer Singh's widow, a beautiful lady known as Rani Roopba (or Roodabai), wanted to perform [[Sati (practice)|Sati]] and join her husband in the afterlife. However, Begada prevented her from giving up her own life and proposed marriage with the dowager.\n\nShe agreed to a marriage proposal on the condition that he would first complete the building of the stepwell. The Muslim king who was deeply enamoured of the queen's beauty agreed to the proposal and built the well in record time. Once the well was completed, Begda reminded the queen of her promise to marry him. Instead, the queen who had achieved her objective of completing the stepwell started by her husband, decided to end her life. She circumambulated the stepwell with prayers and jumped into the well, ending the saga of building the well in tragedy.<ref name=culture/><ref name=mona/><ref name=culture/>\n\nOne version which is narrated in the 200 years old scriptures of Swaminarayan sect suggests that before she died, Rani Roopba requested religious saints to take bath in this stepwell so that the water in the stepwell gets purified by these saints thereby delivering her from her sins.\n\nAnother is linked to the tombs found near the well. The tombs of six masons who built the well are seen near the ''Vav''. Begda asked the Masons if they could build another similar well and when they agreed Begda sentenced them to death instead. Begda was so impressed by the architectural excellence of the stepwell that he did not want a replica to be built.<ref name=culture/>\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:Adalaj Stepwell first floor.jpg|thumb|Adalaj Stepwell first floor]]\n[[File:Adalaj Stepwell - Upper Level - 2.jpg|thumb|Upper storey.]]\n[[File:2T1A1747.jpg|thumb|The step well is five stories deep.]]\n[[File:Schacht Adalaj Stepwell.jpg|right|thumb|Looking up the well.]]\nBuilt in sandstone in the Solanki architectural style, the Adalaj stepwell is five stories deep. It is octagonal in plan at the top, built on intricately carved large number of pillars. Each floor is spacious enough to provide for people to congregate.<ref name=culture/> It was dug deep to access groundwater at that level, accounting for seasonal fluctuations in water level due to rainfall over the years. The air and light vents in the roofs at various floors and at the landing level are in the form of large openings. From the first story level, three staircases lead to the bottom water level of the well, which is considered a unique feature. Built along a north\u2013south axis, entrance is from the south, the three staircases are from the south, west and east directions leading to the landing, which is on the northern side of the well. Four small rooms with [[Oriel window|oriel]] windows decorated with minutely carved brackets are provided at the landing level, at the four corners. The structural system is typically Indian style with traditional [[Trabeated|trabeat]] with horizontal beams and lintels. At the bottom of the well is a square stepped floor in the shape of a funnel extending to the lowest plane. This is chiseled into a circular well. Above the square floor, columns, beams, wall and arched openings spiral around; a feature that continues to the top. The top part of the well, however, is a vertical space open to the sky. The four corners of the square are strengthened with stone beams, set at 45 degrees angle.<ref name=news/>\n\nThe motifs of flowers and graphics of Islamic architecture blend very well with the symbols of Hindu and [[Jain]] gods carved at various levels of the well. The dominant carvings on the upper floors are of elephants ({{convert|3|in|mm}} in size, each of different design). The Islamic architectural style could be attributed to the Muslim king Begda who built it. The walls are carved with women performing daily chores such as churning of buttermilk, adorning themselves, scenes of performance of dancers and musicians, and the King overlooking all these activities.<ref name=adalaj/><ref name=culture/><ref name=ahmed/><ref name=rich/><ref name=mona/>\n[[File:Details of stone carving at Adalaj Stepwell IV, Adalaj, Gujarat.jpg|thumb|right|Intricate carving in the well structure]]\n\nAn interesting depiction carved from a single block of stone is of the ''Ami Khumbor'' (symbolic pot of the water of life) and the ''Kalp Vriksha'' (a tree of life). Also seen is a fresco of [[navagraha]] or nine planets. These depictions are said to attract villagers for worship during marriage and other ritualistic ceremonies.<ref name=adalaj/><ref name=culture/>\n\nThe temperature inside the well is said to be about five degrees lower than the outside hot summer temperatures. This encouraged the women who came to fetch water to spend more time in the cool climes here.

In the past, these stepwells were frequented by travellers and caravans as stopovers along trade routes.<ref name=news/><ref name=detail/><ref name=culture/><ref name=ahmed>{{Cite web|url=http://www.orientalarchitecture.com/ahmedabad/adalajindex.htm|title=Adlaj Vav Step Well (built 1499)|accessdate=17 November 2009|publisher=Asian Historical Architecture}}</ref>\n\nThe first rock-cut step wells in India are dated from 200-400 AD.

The well cylinder was the basic form used to deepen the wells. It is also inferred that the Stepwells in Gujarat have survived so long in view of the builder's knowledge of the soil conditions and the earthquake proneness of the region.<ref>Livingston p.51-52</ref>\n\nThe well size recommended, based on considerations of stability, was of four to thirteen ''[[Hasta (unit)|hasta]]'' ('hasta' a [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] word, which means  \"forearm\" of size varying from {{convert|12|-|24|in|mm}}), A size of eight ''hasta'' was considered ideal and a 13 ''hasta'' well was considered dangerous. However, the well thickness from top to bottom remained generally uniform.<ref>Livingston p.52-53</ref> By the 11th century, the step well planning and design acquired architectural excellence and the Hindu Stepwells were standardized.<ref>Livingston p.54-55</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Adalaj step well or 'Vav', as it is called in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], is intricately carved and is five stories deep. It was built in 1498. The history of the Adalaj step-well is established by an inscription in Sanskrit found on a marble slab positioned in a recess on the first floor, from the eastern entry to the well. Its construction was started by Rana Veer Singh of the Vaghela dynasty of Dandai Desh. But he was killed in a war, whereafter the Muslim king [[Mahmud Begada]] of a neighbouring state built it in Indo-Islamic architectural style, in 1499.<ref name=\"culture\"/><ref name=rich>{{Cite web|url=http://www.architecturecaribbean.com/adalaj_step_well.php|title=Stepping into A Rich History|accessdate=18 November 2009|publisher=Architecture Caribbean}}</ref><ref name=mona>{{Cite web|url=http://monadarling.com/lifestyle/step-wells-of-gujarat-and-rajasthan.html|title= Step-wells of Gujarat and Rajasthan|accessdate=17 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe Sanskrit inscription in the stepwell describes,<ref name=\"Burgess1874\">{{cite book|last1=Burgess|last2=Murray|title=Photographs of Architecture and Scenery in Gujarat and Rajputana|url=https://archive.org/stream/photographsofarc00murr#page/n17/mode/2up|accessdate=23 July 2016|year=1874|publisher=Bourne and Shepherd|page=17|chapter=The Rudra Mala at Siddhpur}}</ref>\n{{quote|\"Samvat 1555 (1498 AD), month of Magha, Mahmud Padshah being king.<br />\n\"Salutation to Vinayaka ([[Ganesha]]) to whose race belonged King Mokala, chief of the country of Dandahi.

His kingdom was a small one. It was subject to water shortage and was highly dependent on the rains. To alleviate the misery of his people, the Rana began the construction of a large and deep stepwell.\n\nBefore this project could be completed, his kingdom was attacked by Mohammed Begda, the Muslim ruler of a neighboring kingdom. The Rana king was killed in battle and his territory was occupied by the invader. Rana Veer Singh's widow, a beautiful lady known as Rani Roopba (or Roodabai), wanted to perform [[Sati (practice)|Sati]] and join her husband in the afterlife. However, Begada prevented her from giving up her own life and proposed marriage with the dowager.\n\nShe agreed to a marriage proposal on the condition that he would first complete the building of the stepwell. The Muslim king who was deeply enamoured of the queen's beauty agreed to the proposal and built the well in record time. Once the well was completed, Begda reminded the queen of her promise to marry him. Instead, the queen who had achieved her objective of completing the stepwell started by her husband, decided to end her life. She circumambulated the stepwell with prayers and jumped into the well, ending the saga of building the well in tragedy.<ref name=culture/><ref name=mona/><ref name=culture/>\n\nOne version which is narrated in the 200 years old scriptures of Swaminarayan sect suggests that before she died, Rani Roopba requested religious saints to take bath in this stepwell so that the water in the stepwell gets purified by these saints thereby delivering her from her sins.\n\nAnother is linked to the tombs found near the well. The tombs of six masons who built the well are seen near the ''Vav''. Begda asked the Masons if they could build another similar well and when they agreed Begda sentenced them to death instead. Begda was so impressed by the architectural excellence of the stepwell that he did not want a replica to be built.<ref name=culture/>\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:Adalaj Stepwell first floor.jpg|thumb|Adalaj Stepwell first floor]]\n[[File:Adalaj Stepwell - Upper Level - 2.jpg|thumb|Upper storey.]]\n[[File:2T1A1747.jpg|thumb|The step well is five stories deep.]]\n[[File:Schacht Adalaj Stepwell.jpg|right|thumb|Looking up the well.]]\nBuilt in sandstone in the Solanki architectural style, the Adalaj stepwell is five stories deep. It is octagonal in plan at the top, built on intricately carved large number of pillars. Each floor is spacious enough to provide for people to congregate.<ref name=culture/> It was dug deep to access groundwater at that level, accounting for seasonal fluctuations in water level due to rainfall over the years. The air and light vents in the roofs at various floors and at the landing level are in the form of large openings. From the first story level, three staircases lead to the bottom water level of the well, which is considered a unique feature. Built along a north\u2013south axis, entrance is from the south, the three staircases are from the south, west and east directions leading to the landing, which is on the northern side of the well. Four small rooms with [[Oriel window|oriel]] windows decorated with minutely carved brackets are provided at the landing level, at the four corners. The structural system is typically Indian style with traditional [[Trabeated|trabeat]] with horizontal beams and lintels. At the bottom of the well is a square stepped floor in the shape of a funnel extending to the lowest plane. This is chiseled into a circular well. Above the square floor, columns, beams, wall and arched openings spiral around; a feature that continues to the top. The top part of the well, however, is a vertical space open to the sky. The four corners of the square are strengthened with stone beams, set at 45 degrees angle.<ref name=news/>\n\nThe motifs of flowers and graphics of Islamic architecture blend very well with the symbols of Hindu and [[Jain]] gods carved at various levels of the well. The dominant carvings on the upper floors are of elephants ({{convert|3|in|mm}} in size, each of different design). The Islamic architectural style could be attributed to the Muslim king Begda who built it. The walls are carved with women performing daily chores such as churning of buttermilk, adorning themselves, scenes of performance of dancers and musicians, and the King overlooking all these activities.<ref name=adalaj/><ref name=culture/><ref name=ahmed/><ref name=rich/><ref name=mona/>\n[[File:Details of stone carving at Adalaj Stepwell IV, Adalaj, Gujarat.jpg|thumb|right|Intricate carving in the well structure]]\n\nAn interesting depiction carved from a single block of stone is of the ''Ami Khumbor'' (symbolic pot of the water of life) and the ''Kalp Vriksha'' (a tree of life). Also seen is a fresco of [[navagraha]] or nine planets. These depictions are said to attract villagers for worship during marriage and other ritualistic ceremonies.<ref name=adalaj/><ref name=culture/>\n\nThe temperature inside the well is said to be about five degrees lower than the outside hot summer temperatures. This encouraged the women who came to fetch water to spend more time in the cool climes here. They stayed to worship the gods and goddesses and gossip.<ref name=adalaj/><ref name=culture/>\n\nA tribute paid to the rich underground structures, which are intricately decorated with sculptures, is that they are said to resemble palaces.<ref name=define/>\n\n==Tourist information==\nThe Adalaj step-well is a popular tourist attraction of the [[Gandhinagar]] city and is situated {{convert|18|km|mi}} north of Ahmedabad city.<ref name=ahmed/> It is {{convert|5|km|mi}} from [[Gandhinagar]], the capital city of Gujarat.<ref name=culture/>\n\nAhmedabad is well connected by road, rail and air links with the rest of the country.

Boukouvalas published in 1905 in Cairo a brief brochure under the title \"The language of the Bulgarophones in Macedonia\" (1905). This essay, which assumed the Slav character of the foreign-language idioms of Greek Macedonia by naming them \"Bulgarian\", included a long list of Slavic words with Greek roots which are used in the dialects. ... Konstantinos Tsioulkas published in 1907 in Athens a book over 350 pages in length to prove the ancient Greek character of the idioms in Greek Macecionia!... : \"Contributions to the bilinguism of the Macedonians by comparison of the Slav'-like Macedonian language to Greek\" ... Tsioulkas \"proved\" through a series of \"etymological\" lists that the inhabitants of Greece's Macedonia spoke a pure Ancient-Greek dialect. ... In 1948 by a third teacher, Giorgos Georgiades, (wrote) under the promising title \"The mixed idiom in Macedonia and the ethnological situation of the Macedonians who speak it\". Here it is stated that many words from the dialects maintain their \"Ancient Greek character\". Still, the language itself was presented as a mixture of Greek, Turkish and words borrowed from other languages. As a result, the author found himself incapable of defining it as either Greek or Slav. In examining such publications, one will easily recognise ideological and methodological similarities. One common factor for all the authors is that they ignored not only the dialects they wrote about, but also the Slavic languages entirely. This fact did not hinder them in creating or republishing etymological lists tracing every Slavic word back to Ancient Greek with fictional correlations.}}</ref> Among them, Boukouvalas promoted an enormous influence of the [[Greek language]] on a Bulgarian idiom and a discussion about their probable Greek descent.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> Tsioulkas followed him by publishing a large book, where he \"proved\" through an \"etymological\" approach, that these idioms are a pure [[Ancient Greek]] dialect.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> A publication of the third teacher followed, Giorgos Georgiades, who presented the language as a mixture of Greek, Turkish and other loanwords, but was incapable of deifining the dialects as either Greek or Slav.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/>\n\nSerbian dialectology does not usually extend the Serbian dialects to Greek Macedonia, but an unconventional classification has been maken by [[Aleksandar Beli\u0107]], a convinced Serbian nationalist, who regarded the dialects as [[Serbian dialects|Serbian]].<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> In [[:File:Balkan dialects belic 1914.jpg|his classification]] he distinguished three categories of dialects in Greek Macedonia: a Serbo-Macedonian dialect, a Bulgaro-Macedonian teritorry where Serbian is spoken and a Non-Slavic territory.\n\n=== Ban for use ===\nAfter the conclusion of the [[First World War]] a widespread policy of Hellenisation was implemented in the Greek region of Macedonia.{{sfn|HRW|1994|p=?}}<ref name=\"Nettle 2000 175\">{{cite book\n | last = Nettle\n | first = Daniel\n | authorlink = \n | author2 = Suzanne Romaine\n | title = Vanishing Voices: The Extinction of the World's Languages\n | publisher = Oxford University Press US\n | year = 2000\n | location = \n | page = [https://archive.org/details/vanishingvoicese00nett_0/page/175 175]\n | isbn = 0-19-513624-1\n | url = https://archive.org/details/vanishingvoicese00nett_0/page/175\n }}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n | last = Pentzopoulos\n | first = Dimitri\n | title = The Balkan exchange of minorities and its impact on Greece\n | publisher = C.

Since the 1990s several publications in Pomak dialect have been issued, using the Greek script or using the Latin. Some criticisms to these publications were related to their funding sources. For example by the cases using the [[Greek script]], two volumes of a textbooks were printed in 2004. Their author was Nikos Kokkas and  publisher ''Pakethra''. The funding here was provided by a Greek businessman and directly through his company. The preface of a Pomak primer presents it as one of the \u201clesser-spoken languages\u201d of Europe.<ref>Vemund Aarbakke, \u201cPomak Language Usage and the Spell of Nationalism\u2014The Case of the Pomaks in Greece,\u201d Slavia Islamica: language, religion and identity, edited by Robert D.

It is even not used in the local Pomak newspaper \"Zagalisa\", that is published in Greek. Recently, the use of Pomak is preferred in a new  local newspaper \"Natpresh\". Pomak is not being actively promoted neither by Pomak communities, nor by the Greek authorities. The result is a strong language shift in Greece towards Turkish.<ref>Evangelia Adamou, Davide Fanciullo. Why Pomak will not be the next Slavic literary language. D. Stern; M. Nomachi; B. Beli\u0107.

Boukouvalas published in 1905 in Cairo a brief brochure under the title \"The language of the Bulgarophones in Macedonia\" (1905). This essay, which assumed the Slav character of the foreign-language idioms of Greek Macedonia by naming them \"Bulgarian\", included a long list of Slavic words with Greek roots which are used in the dialects. ... Konstantinos Tsioulkas published in 1907 in Athens a book over 350 pages in length to prove the ancient Greek character of the idioms in Greek Macecionia!... : \"Contributions to the bilinguism of the Macedonians by comparison of the Slav'-like Macedonian language to Greek\" ... Tsioulkas \"proved\" through a series of \"etymological\" lists that the inhabitants of Greece's Macedonia spoke a pure Ancient-Greek dialect. ... In 1948 by a third teacher, Giorgos Georgiades, (wrote) under the promising title \"The mixed idiom in Macedonia and the ethnological situation of the Macedonians who speak it\". Here it is stated that many words from the dialects maintain their \"Ancient Greek character\". Still, the language itself was presented as a mixture of Greek, Turkish and words borrowed from other languages. As a result, the author found himself incapable of defining it as either Greek or Slav. In examining such publications, one will easily recognise ideological and methodological similarities. One common factor for all the authors is that they ignored not only the dialects they wrote about, but also the Slavic languages entirely. This fact did not hinder them in creating or republishing etymological lists tracing every Slavic word back to Ancient Greek with fictional correlations.}}</ref> Among them, Boukouvalas promoted an enormous influence of the [[Greek language]] on a Bulgarian idiom and a discussion about their probable Greek descent.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> Tsioulkas followed him by publishing a large book, where he \"proved\" through an \"etymological\" approach, that these idioms are a pure [[Ancient Greek]] dialect.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> A publication of the third teacher followed, Giorgos Georgiades, who presented the language as a mixture of Greek, Turkish and other loanwords, but was incapable of deifining the dialects as either Greek or Slav.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/>\n\nSerbian dialectology does not usually extend the Serbian dialects to Greek Macedonia, but an unconventional classification has been maken by [[Aleksandar Beli\u0107]], a convinced Serbian nationalist, who regarded the dialects as [[Serbian dialects|Serbian]].<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> In [[:File:Balkan dialects belic 1914.jpg|his classification]] he distinguished three categories of dialects in Greek Macedonia: a Serbo-Macedonian dialect, a Bulgaro-Macedonian teritorry where Serbian is spoken and a Non-Slavic territory.\n\n=== Ban for use ===\nAfter the conclusion of the [[First World War]] a widespread policy of Hellenisation was implemented in the Greek region of Macedonia.{{sfn|HRW|1994|p=?}}<ref name=\"Nettle 2000 175\">{{cite book\n | last = Nettle\n | first = Daniel\n | authorlink = \n | author2 = Suzanne Romaine\n | title = Vanishing Voices: The Extinction of the World's Languages\n | publisher = Oxford University Press US\n | year = 2000\n | location = \n | page = [https://archive.org/details/vanishingvoicese00nett_0/page/175 175]\n | isbn = 0-19-513624-1\n | url = https://archive.org/details/vanishingvoicese00nett_0/page/175\n }}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n | last = Pentzopoulos\n | first = Dimitri\n | title = The Balkan exchange of minorities and its impact on Greece\n | publisher = C.

It is even not used in the local Pomak newspaper \"Zagalisa\", that is published in Greek. Recently, the use of Pomak is preferred in a new  local newspaper \"Natpresh\". Pomak is not being actively promoted neither by Pomak communities, nor by the Greek authorities.
