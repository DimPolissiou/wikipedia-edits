McNuggets are available in 4, 6, 10 (originally 9), or 20 pieces. Occasionally, they are made available in 40- or 50-piece packs on a promotional basis. While made from a combination of white and dark meat until 2003, they are now made only with white meat. In 2011, five new dipping sauces were introduced and added to the line-up: sweet chili, honey mustard, spicy buffalo, and creamy ranch. With the addition of these new dipping sauces, McDonald's began phasing out the Hot Mustard sauce, and by February 2014, it had been discontinued in most U.S. markets, while in Quebec, Canada, at least, the original four dipping sauces (barbecue, sweet 'n sour, hot mustard and honey) persist as of 2018.\n\n=== Premium Chicken Sandwiches ===\n[[McDonald's Premium line|Premium chicken sandwiches]], the Premium chicken line was added in July 2005.

The Club is similar to the Classic, with added bacon and a piece of Swiss cheese. In Latin America, the Classic and the Club are sold, but a honey mustard chicken sandwich is sold in place of the BLT. All were served on a whole-grain roll, with either a grilled or crispy chicken breast. On March 20, 2014, the Premium Crispy Chicken Bacon Clubhouse and Premium Grilled Chicken Bacon Clubhouse were added to the line-up (alongside the beef variant of the sandwich) on a new artisan roll.

The standard crispy offering was renamed the Premium Crispy Chicken Deluxe (later the Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Sandwich in August 2015) and it was upgraded to sit on the artisan roll introduced with the Bacon Clubhouse.

The only other change is that it is now sold on an artisan roll instead of the potato bun that characterized the original Crispy Chicken Deluxe.

Both are served with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and garlic mayonnaise in addition to two small patties of grilled chicken or kofta, all wrapped in an Arabian-style pita bread. McDonald's has employed a rather large advertising campaign for the McArabia since its introduction in 2003, largely focusing on the Arabian-themed nature of the sandwich, and it appears to have worked well. The McArabia has been very well received throughout Southwestern Eurasia. The same product is also introduced in Malaysia with \"Chicken Foldover\" as an alternative name.\n\n=== Buttermilk Crispy Tenders ===\n[[Buttermilk Crispy Tenders]] are strips formulated with the buttermilk recipe used for the August 2015 revamp of the fried chicken sandwich, and were introduced in U.S. restaurants in September 2017. While they bear a resemblance to Chicken Selects, they are created and prepared differently. They feature a buttermilk chicken base and are cooked from thawed instead of frozen. This creates a juicier product than the Selects, as well as reduces cook time,<ref>https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/product/buttermilk-crispy-chicken-tenders-4-piece.html</ref> though immediate supply issues caused them to effectively be removed from the menu until the end of December 2017.

It is part of the Taste-Crafted Chicken sandwiches menu introduced in 2016.\n* Maharaja Mac \u2013 In [[India]], McDonald's does not serve beef in its burgers.

It is released annually in the U.S. as a limited time promotion in some locations. Since 2005, the McRib has reappeared in late October staying on the menu for 10 weeks. The McRib was released in Canada as a promotional sandwich from March 18 through April 8, 2008, and again in summer 2011.

All of its salads are part of McDonald's move towards creating a healthier image.\n\n=== Sides ===\n\n* McDonald's sells french fries as its primary side order.

Happy meals include a tiny order fries (around half of a small order of fries) and fruit, optional sauce for fries, and a choice of nuggets, a single patty burger, or wraps. An additional product, Pasta Zoo was discontinued in 2008. The Mighty Kids Meal contains more food than the Happy Meal, less than the adult meal, and still contains a toy. The toy is usually a [[product tie-in]] with a movie or popular television show.\n\nIn mid-February 2012, McDonald's introduced the Happy Meals/Mighty Kids Meals so that they now come with either a Hamburger, Cheeseburger, 4-piece Chicken McNuggets, McDouble or the 6-piece Chicken McNuggets with a smaller version of the small fry for the Happy Meal or a small fry for a Mighty Kids Meal.

Later it was scaled down to a personal-sized pizza. However, variations have found their way into some international markets such as India (the pie-like \"Pizza McPuff\").

Sold only in Alaska, named after [[Denali]] (formerly Mount McKinley).\n\n==Chicken==\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2018}}\n\n=== McChicken ===\nA [[McChicken]] is a mildly spicy chicken sandwich which is also offered in a spicier variant (the Hot n' Spicy) in some markets. The sandwich is made from 100% ground white meat chicken, mayonnaise, and shredded lettuce, on a toasted bun.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mcdonalds.com/content/us/en-us/product/mcchicken.html|title=McChicken\u00ae: Chicken Sandwich {{!}} McDonald's|website=www.mcdonalds.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-05}}</ref> A full-size version was introduced in 1980, later removed, and reintroduced in 1988. In some markets, it is not spicy, and in others, a [[Cajun cuisine|cajun spiced]] version is also offered. It remains one of the biggest sellers, just behind the Big Mac.{{Original research inline|date=October 2017}} The larger sandwich was replaced with the Crispy Chicken Deluxe in 1996, and brought back in 1998 in the current smaller size, and marketed as the Cajun (Style) McChicken. In Australia, the average serving size for a McChicken is {{cvt|185|g|oz}}. In Canada, it remains a full-size sandwich, while the US' smaller version is sold there as the Junior Chicken.\n\n=== McNuggets ===\n[[Chicken McNuggets]] introduced in 1983 as a replacement for the McChicken, these are small chicken chunks served with dipping sauces of [[Barbecue sauce|barbecue]], [[Sweet and sour sauce|sweet n' sour]], honey, and [[Mustard (condiment)|hot mustard]]. McNuggets are available in 4, 6, 10 (originally 9), or 20 pieces. Occasionally, they are made available in 40- or 50-piece packs on a promotional basis. While made from a combination of white and dark meat until 2003, they are now made only with white meat. In 2011, five new dipping sauces were introduced and added to the line-up: sweet chili, honey mustard, spicy buffalo, and creamy ranch. With the addition of these new dipping sauces, McDonald's began phasing out the Hot Mustard sauce, and by February 2014, it had been discontinued in most U.S. markets, while in Quebec, Canada, at least, the original four dipping sauces (barbecue, sweet 'n sour, hot mustard and honey) persist as of 2018.\n\n=== Premium Chicken Sandwiches ===\n[[McDonald's Premium line|Premium chicken sandwiches]], the Premium chicken line was added in July 2005. The Classic was a [[rebranding]] of the Crispy Chicken and Chicken McGrill sandwiches, themselves 1998 rebrandings of the Deluxe chicken line. It contains mayonnaise, leaf lettuce, and a tomato slice. The Ranch [[BLT sandwich|BLT]] contains ranch sauce instead of mayonnaise and includes bacon. The Club is similar to the Classic, with added bacon and a piece of Swiss cheese. In Latin America, the Classic and the Club are sold, but a honey mustard chicken sandwich is sold in place of the BLT. All were served on a whole-grain roll, with either a grilled or crispy chicken breast. On March 20, 2014, the Premium Crispy Chicken Bacon Clubhouse and Premium Grilled Chicken Bacon Clubhouse were added to the line-up (alongside the beef variant of the sandwich) on a new artisan roll. In February 2015 the Ranch BLT and Club were removed from the menu. The standard crispy offering was renamed the Premium Crispy Chicken Deluxe (later the Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Sandwich in August 2015) and it was upgraded to sit on the artisan roll introduced with the Bacon Clubhouse. In the first week of April 2015, McDonald's replaced the Premium Grilled Chicken sandwich with the Artisan Grilled Chicken.<ref name=\"mcdonalds1\">{{cite web |url=http://news.mcdonalds.com/US/news-stories/Artisan-Grilled-Chicken |title=Artisan Grilled Chicken |publisher=McDonald's |date=April 6, 2015 |accessdate=July 13, 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808030410/http://news.mcdonalds.com/US/news-stories/Artisan-Grilled-Chicken |archivedate=August 8, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nMcDonald's line of larger chicken sandwiches (The Classic, Club, Ranch BLT, and Southwest), which are part of the McDonald's Premium line were introduced in July 2005 as part of McDonald's menu revamp\n\n* The Classic includes lettuce, tomato, and mayo.\n* The Club also has lettuce, tomato and mayo but also comes with [[Swiss cheese (North America)|Swiss cheese]] and bacon.\n* The Ranch BLT comes with a creamy ranch sauce, bacon, lettuce and tomato.\n* The Grand Chicken Burger: Large chicken patty with two layers of cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and sauce.\n* The Southwest comes with a southwest style nacho chili sauce, lettuce, tomato, and spicy pepper jack cheese.\n\nAll four can be chosen with either crispy or grilled chicken and all are served on a wheat ciabatta bun.\n\n==== Premium Chicken Deluxe ====\nPremium Chicken Deluxe \u2013 a sandwich made with a crispy chicken breast, tomato slices, and lettuce. It was first sold in 1996 and had its name changed to the Crispy Chicken Sandwich in 1998. It was replaced with a Premium chicken sandwich in July 2005 and was then brought back in 2015 under the original name with the added prefix Premium. The only other change is that it is now sold on an artisan roll instead of the potato bun that characterized the original Crispy Chicken Deluxe. By August 2015 it was renamed the Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Sandwich. This is part of the Taste-Crafted Chicken sandwiches introduced in 2016.\n\n===== Grilled Chicken Deluxe =====\nGrilled Chicken Deluxe \u2013 this sandwich has the same ingredients as the Premium Crispy Chicken Deluxe but has a marinated, grilled chicken breast at its center. It has been sold under various names since 1996, when it was introduced as the Grilled Chicken Deluxe, and had its name changed to the Chicken McGrill in 1998. It was replaced with a Premium chicken sandwich in July 2005, which was in turn replaced with the Artisan Grilled Chicken in 2015. It is also available in India and has at times been available in Canada.\n\n==== Tasted Crafted ====\nTaste-Crafted Chicken sandwiches, like the Taste-Crafted Burgers, were introduced in 2016 in West Coast markets, and in all other U.S. markets in January 2017. Signature Sriracha was the latest to be added in June 2016, reinstated in July through September 2017, and reinstated again permanently in January 2018; it was replaced by Sweet Barbecue Bacon in May 2017, which by July 2018 was changed to Bacon Smokehouse.\n==== Deli Choices ====\nDeli Choices is a line of [[Delicatessen|deli]]-style sandwiches that are sold internationally. It is targeted at health-conscious customers and is available in Austria, Canada, Germany, and Britain, and is testing in the United States. It is similar to the McHero sandwich, sold in parts of the United States.\n\n=== Snack Wrap ===\n[[Snack Wrap]] \u2013 a [[wrap (food)|wrap]] made with [[white meat]] [[chicken (food)|chicken breast]] (crispy or grilled), lettuce, shredded [[Cheddar cheese]] and [[Monterey Jack cheese]], and a sauce (Spicy Buffalo, [[Ranch dressing|Ranch]], [[Honey mustard]], [[Chipotle]] barbecue, or Salsa Roja, the breakfast sauce on the McSkillet), wrapped in a soft flour [[tortilla]].

Both are served with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and garlic mayonnaise in addition to two small patties of grilled chicken or kofta, all wrapped in an Arabian-style pita bread. McDonald's has employed a rather large advertising campaign for the McArabia since its introduction in 2003, largely focusing on the Arabian-themed nature of the sandwich, and it appears to have worked well. The McArabia has been very well received throughout Southwestern Eurasia. The same product is also introduced in Malaysia with \"Chicken Foldover\" as an alternative name.\n\n=== Buttermilk Crispy Tenders ===\n[[Buttermilk Crispy Tenders]] are strips formulated with the buttermilk recipe used for the August 2015 revamp of the fried chicken sandwich, and were introduced in U.S. restaurants in September 2017. While they bear a resemblance to Chicken Selects, they are created and prepared differently. They feature a buttermilk chicken base and are cooked from thawed instead of frozen. This creates a juicier product than the Selects, as well as reduces cook time,<ref>https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/product/buttermilk-crispy-chicken-tenders-4-piece.html</ref> though immediate supply issues caused them to effectively be removed from the menu until the end of December 2017.

Available in only a few markets.\n* Artisan Grilled Chicken \u2013 in the first week of April 2015, McDonald's introduced a redesigned grilled chicken patty, replacing the Premium Grilled Chicken sandwich, which contains \"fewer ingredients\", and those that remain can be found in consumer's \"own kitchens\".<ref name=\"mcdonalds1\" /> The sandwich sits atop the artisan roll first seen with the Bacon Clubhouse and is the last of the full-size chicken sandwiches to switch to this bun. It is part of the Taste-Crafted Chicken sandwiches menu introduced in 2016.\n* Maharaja Mac \u2013 In [[India]], McDonald's does not serve beef in its burgers. Instead, it has created a large Big Mac style chicken burger called the \"Chicken Maharaja Mac\", with a chicken patty and vegetable garnishings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chicken Maharaja Mac|url=http://www.mcdonaldsindia.net/burgers/chicken-maharaja-mac.aspx|publisher=McDonald's India|accessdate=13 March 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327143332/http://www.mcdonaldsindia.net/burgers/chicken-maharaja-mac.aspx|archivedate=March 27, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* Tasty Basket \u2013 Available only in [[Italy]], the Tasty Basket consists of 30 pieces of chicken, which includes the Chicken McNugget, Chicken McBites, and [[chicken wings as food|chicken wings]].<ref name=\"Tasty Basket 30 pezzi\" />\n*[[Buttermilk Crispy Tenders|Chicken Selects]] - Still available in the U.K., these are strips of chicken cooked from frozen and served in a 3- or 5-piece serving.

Nearly identical to a [[Chick-fil-A]] chicken sandwich. Discontinued at many franchises in early 2015.\n\n==Fish==\n* [[Filet-O-Fish]] \u2013 a fish fillet with [[tartar sauce]] and a half slice of cheese on a steamed bun.

It is released annually in the U.S. as a limited time promotion in some locations. Since 2005, the McRib has reappeared in late October staying on the menu for 10 weeks. The McRib was released in Canada as a promotional sandwich from March 18 through April 8, 2008, and again in summer 2011.

In the U.S., the newest salad offerings are part of the [[McDonald's Premium line]]. First introduced in 2003, the Premium Salads are a mixture of [[iceberg lettuce]] and a special lettuce assortment ([[Romaine lettuce|romaine]], etc.), with [[cherry tomato]]es and different toppings to differentiate them; additionally, all salads can be topped with warm grilled or crispy chicken. All of its salads are part of McDonald's move towards creating a healthier image.\n\n=== Sides ===\n\n* McDonald's sells french fries as its primary side order. Until 1967, French Fries were never frozen, but were cut on-site from potatoes and immediately fried. In some international locations, they sell potato wedges, a type of potato chip that is thick cut and wedge-shaped and fried onion pieces that are similar to onion rings.\n\n* Many McDonald's locations in discount stores offer freshly popped popcorn and soft pretzels in addition to the normal menu. In PA stores, only soft pretzels are offered as a side option.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n* Garlic fries were tested in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2016, using locally grown garlic from Gilroy, California\n\n* Bacon Cheese Fries was added to the menu in January 2019.

The meal includes an [[entr\u00e9e]], a side dish, a beverage and a toy. Happy meals include a tiny order fries (around half of a small order of fries) and fruit, optional sauce for fries, and a choice of nuggets, a single patty burger, or wraps.

McDonald's began selling these in 1990 as an optional item and stopped selling them in 2003. They are still sold in China, Spain, Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Island of [[St Croix]] as of March 6, 2010. Also sold as McWings in Pakistan, they were discontinued for a while but relaunched. On September 9, 2013, McDonald's brought the Mighty Wings back to its menus in all of its American restaurants as a limited time offer available until November 2013. The Mighty Wings did not sell well its second time around in the U.S. The main problems cited with the Mighty Wings was the price point versus the amount purchased. Compared with competitors, the pricing was determined to be too high, but McDonald's stated that due to overruns in purchasing, the company could not sell them at lower prices without losing money. On February 24, 2014, McDonald's decided to put them back on the menu for a limited engagement to liquidate the remaining inventory at a lower price in all U.S. locations.\n* Morning Mac - A breakfast sandwich featuring the same ingredients as the Sausage McMuffin with Egg, but with two slices of cheese and two sausage patties.

Was on the Dollar Menu & More menu from December 2015 to March 2016.\n* '''Super Size''' was [[McDonald's]] restaurants' largest size on their french fries and soft drinks. The documentary film ''[[Super Size Me]]'' had a negative effect on the image and popularity of the Super Size fries and drinks offering. In the United States, McDonald's began to phase out the supersized option from their regular menu in March 2004. The company stated the need to simplify their menu and to offer healthier food choices.\n* Onion Nuggets \u2013 introduced at the same time as the Beefsteak Sandwich as the side item for the Dinner Menu. Onion Nuggets were chopped onions shaped into small solid pieces, dipped in batter and deep-fried.\n* [[Philly Cheesesteak]] \u2013 Slices of steak and Swiss cheese with onions. Served until August 2007 at Australian and American McDonald's. This sandwich is still available in Canada, made with cheese spread and green bell pepper.\n* [[Pizza]] / McPizza \u2013 McDonald's has also attempted [[pizza]] at various times,<ref name=csm/><ref name=\"howstuffworks2\"/> with an apple-pie\u2013like McPizza and more conventional McDonald's Pizza. A line of personal-sized pizzas was first seen in the late 1970s in test-market stores near interstate highways around Milwaukee and Madison. In Canada (c. 1992\u201399), the pizza originally began as a family-sized pizza that was brought out to the table by an employee and placed on a raised rack in the centre of the table. Later it was scaled down to a personal-sized pizza. However, variations have found their way into some international markets such as India (the pie-like \"Pizza McPuff\"). McDonald's also test marketed a 14-inch, round, traditional-style pizza in [[Evansville, Indiana]], and nearby [[Owensboro, Kentucky]], in 1989.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://business.highbeam.com/409700/article-1G1-7834069/mcpizza-mcdonald-widens-pizza-test-pizza-operators|title=McPizza?

The site was chosen in the mid-1950s by Cantona's paternal grandmother, whose husband was a stonemason. By the time Cantona was born in 1966, the hillside cave had become little more than a room in the family's house, which was now up to a habitable standard. Cantona has two brothers: Jean-Marie, who is four years older, and [[Jo\u00ebl Cantona|Jo\u00ebl]], who is 17 months younger.\n\n== Club career==\n===Early career===\nCantona began his football career with SO Caillolais, his local team and one that had produced such talent as [[Roger Jouve]] and had players such as [[Jean Tigana]] and [[Christophe Galtier]] within its ranks. Originally, Cantona began to follow in his father's footsteps and often played as a [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], but his creative instincts began to take over and he would play up front more and more often. In his time with SO Caillolais, Cantona played in more than 200 matches.\n\n===France===\nCantona's first professional club was [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]], where he spent two years in the youth team before making his debut on 5 November 1983, in a 4\u20130 league victory over Nancy.<ref name=\"timeline\"/>\n\nIn 1984 his footballing career was put on hold as he carried out his [[national service]]. After his discharge he was loaned out to [[FC Martigues|Martigues]]<ref name=\"timeline\"/> in the French Second Division before rejoining Auxerre and signing a professional contract in 1986. His performances in the First Division were good enough to earn him his first full international [[cap (football)|cap]] when barely in his twenties. However, his disciplinary problems began in 1987 when he was fined for punching teammate [[Bruno Martini]] in the face.<ref name=\"timeline\">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/the-life-and-times-of-eric-cantona-1570034.html |title=The life and times of Eric Cantona |work=The Independent |date=27 January 1995 |accessdate=25 January 2018 }}</ref>\n\nThe following year, Cantona was again in trouble because of a dangerous kung-fu tackle on Nantes player [[Michel Der Zakarian]], resulting in a three-month suspension,<ref name=\"timeline\"/> this was later reduced to a two-month suspension as his club Auxerre threatened to make the player unavailable for selection in the national team.

At Montpellier, he was involved in a fight with teammate [[Jean-Claude Lemoult]] and threw his boots in Lemoult's face. The incident led to six players demanding that Cantona be sacked, but with the support of teammates such as [[Laurent Blanc]] and [[Carlos Valderrama (footballer)|Carlos Valderrama]], the club retained his services, although they banned him from the ground for ten days.<ref>Cantona subsequently played a role in Blanc's arrival at Manchester United in 2001 having boasted about the talent Blanc possessed. \"Cantona returns\", 2001.</ref> Cantona was instrumental as the team went on to win the French Cup and his form persuaded Marseille to take him back.\n\nBack at Marseille, Cantona initially played well under coach [[Gerard Gili]] and his successor [[Franz Beckenbauer]]. However, the Marseille chairman [[Bernard Tapie]] was not satisfied with the results, and replaced Beckenbauer with [[Raymond Goethals]]; Cantona was continually at odds with Goethals and Tapie and, despite helping the team win the [[Ligue 1|French Division 1]] title, he was transferred to [[N\u00eemes Olympique|N\u00eemes]] the following season.\n\nIn December 1991, during a match for N\u00eemes, he threw the ball at the referee, having been angered by one of his decisions. He was summoned to a disciplinary hearing by the [[French Football Federation]] and was banned for one month. Cantona responded by walking up to each member of the hearing committee in turn and calling him an \"idiot\". His ban was increased to two months, and Cantona subsequently announced his retirement from football on 16 December 1991.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zJVUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=R5ADAAAAIBAJ&pg=6927,1151918&dq=eric-cantona&hl=en |title=Cantona packs it in |work=New Straits Times |via=Google News |date=18 December 1991 |accessdate=25 January 2018 }}</ref>\n\nThe France national team coach, [[Michel Platini]], was a fan of Cantona, and persuaded him to make a comeback.

Souness thanked Platini, but declined the offer, citing dressing room harmony as his reason.\n\nAfter being turned down by Liverpool, Cantona was given a trial at [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] when Wednesday manager [[Trevor Francis]] was approached by Platini and Francis' former agent, Dennis Roach. In a 2012 interview Francis explained that he had agreed to take Cantona on as a favour to Roach and Platini, who he knew from his time playing in Italy, and that it was intended as an opportunity for Cantona to put himself in the \"shop window\": Wednesday had only recently been promoted back to the top flight, with most of the squad still being on Second Division-level wages, and the club could not afford to sign him.

Two days later, Wilkinson announced that Leeds intended to complete Cantona's transfer from N\u00eemes for \u00a3900,000.

Dubbed the 'Mission Impossible', Cantona and [[Gordon Strachan]] combined to set up [[Gary Speed]], who scored with a left-footed volley. [[Andreas Buck]] equalised for Stuttgart in the 34th minute, the [[Away goals rule|away goal]] meaning that Leeds needed another four to progress. McAllister scored a penalty just before half-time to make it 2\u20131 to Leeds before Cantona's looping shot in the 66th minute was deflected into his own net by [[G\u00fcnther Sch\u00e4fer]]. Chapman's header at the near post made it 4\u20131 in the 78th minute but Stuttgart remained firm and denied Leeds the decisive fifth goal. However, Leeds received a stroke of luck when it emerged after the match that Stuttgart's coach, [[Christoph Daum]], had fielded four 'foreign' players, one more than allowed. Leeds were awarded a 3\u20130 victory by UEFA, and a play-off match was ordered at the neutral [[Camp Nou]] in Barcelona on 9 October.<ref>Auclair (2009), pp. 225\u20136.</ref>\n\nAn exhausted Leeds then stumbled to a 4\u20132 defeat at [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], with Cantona's form dipping through fatigue and injury.

Leeds also lost the return leg 2\u20131, Rangers scoring through [[Mark Hateley]] and [[Ally McCoist]], before Cantona scored a late consolation goal. In between the two games, Cantona was an unused substitute when Leeds travelled to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] as Wilkinson, favouring a more direct approach, found no room for him.

Cantona was then guilty of \"two dreadful misses\" as [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] knocked them out of the League Cup on 10 November. Despite suffering along with his team, Wilkinson, rather than Cantona, was held responsible, after having to reinvigorate a side with a number of ageing stars. Despite Cantona scoring (with his shoulder) for France against Finland four days later, Wilkinson kept him out of the team, citing an unconvincing excuse of a \"groin strain\", as Leeds pulled off an improbable but resounding 3\u20130 win over Arsenal, ending the Gunners' six-game winning run.<ref>Auclair (2009), p. 234.</ref> Furious at being dropped, Cantona refused to report for training and faxed a transfer request to the club on 24 November, stating a preference to join Manchester United, Liverpool or Arsenal.<ref>Auclair (2009), pp. 234\u20135</ref>\n\n====Manchester United====\n=====Transfer from Leeds United=====\nThe news of Cantona's impending transfer from Leeds to fierce rivals Manchester United was met with hostility from Leeds fans.

Platini stated that whilst he was coach, Cantona would be selected for France as long as he was playing competitive top-class football; it was Platini who had initiated Cantona's move to England to restart his career. France qualified for [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 1992]] held in Sweden, but failed to win a single game despite the striking partnership of Cantona and [[Jean-Pierre Papin]]. Platini resigned after the finals to be replaced by [[G\u00e9rard Houllier]].\n\nUnder Houllier, France failed to qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] in the U.S. after losing the final game 2\u20131 at home to [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] when a draw would have sufficed. Houllier resigned and [[Aim\u00e9 Jacquet]] took over. Jacquet began to rebuild the national team in preparation for [[1996 European Football Championship|Euro 96]] and appointed Cantona as captain. Cantona remained captain until the Selhurst Park incident in January 1995. The suspension which resulted from this incident also prevented him from playing in international matches.\n\nBy the time Cantona's suspension had been completed, he had lost his role as the team's playmaker to [[Zinedine Zidane]], as Jacquet had revamped the squad with some new players. Cantona, Papin and [[David Ginola]] lost their places in the squad and were never selected for the French team again, thus missing Euro 96. Though there was media criticism about Cantona's omission, as he was playing his best football in the [[Premier League]], Jacquet stated that the team had done well without Cantona, and that he wanted to keep faith with the players who had taken them so far.<ref>Wightman 2002, p. 198.</ref> In a 2015 interview with French radio network [[France Info]], Cantona stated that had he still been involved with the national side, he would have extended his career to feature in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], held in Cantona's home nation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/barclays-premier-league/story/2626908/cantona-would-have-delayed-retirement-for-1998-world-cup|first=Mark|last=Rodden|title=Man United star Eric Cantona would've delayed retirement for France 1998 WC|work=ESPN FC|date=24 September 2015|accessdate=25 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nCantona still harbours resentment for the people at the head of his national team but also admiration for his adopted football country; at [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]] and the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], he supported England and not France.<ref name=\"blast\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2004/3848181.stm |title=Cantona blasts France |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 June 2004 |accessdate=25 January 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Post-playing career==\n\n===Acting career===\n[[File:Looking for Eric Cannes 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Cantona (far right) at the premiere of [[Ken Loach]]\u2018s film ''[[Looking for Eric]]'' (2009) at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. ]]\nHe focused his later career mostly as an actor in French cinema, having had his first role as a rugby player in ''[[Le bonheur est dans le pr\u00e9]]'', shot during his 1995 suspension from football.

The site was chosen in the mid-1950s by Cantona's paternal grandmother, whose husband was a stonemason. By the time Cantona was born in 1966, the hillside cave had become little more than a room in the family's house, which was now up to a habitable standard. Cantona has two brothers: Jean-Marie, who is four years older, and [[Jo\u00ebl Cantona|Jo\u00ebl]], who is 17 months younger.\n\n== Club career==\n===Early career===\nCantona began his football career with SO Caillolais, his local team and one that had produced such talent as [[Roger Jouve]] and had players such as [[Jean Tigana]] and [[Christophe Galtier]] within its ranks. Originally, Cantona began to follow in his father's footsteps and often played as a [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], but his creative instincts began to take over and he would play up front more and more often. In his time with SO Caillolais, Cantona played in more than 200 matches.\n\n===France===\nCantona's first professional club was [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]], where he spent two years in the youth team before making his debut on 5 November 1983, in a 4\u20130 league victory over Nancy.<ref name=\"timeline\"/>\n\nIn 1984 his footballing career was put on hold as he carried out his [[national service]]. After his discharge he was loaned out to [[FC Martigues|Martigues]]<ref name=\"timeline\"/> in the French Second Division before rejoining Auxerre and signing a professional contract in 1986. His performances in the First Division were good enough to earn him his first full international [[cap (football)|cap]] when barely in his twenties. However, his disciplinary problems began in 1987 when he was fined for punching teammate [[Bruno Martini]] in the face.<ref name=\"timeline\">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/the-life-and-times-of-eric-cantona-1570034.html |title=The life and times of Eric Cantona |work=The Independent |date=27 January 1995 |accessdate=25 January 2018 }}</ref>\n\nThe following year, Cantona was again in trouble because of a dangerous kung-fu tackle on Nantes player [[Michel Der Zakarian]], resulting in a three-month suspension,<ref name=\"timeline\"/> this was later reduced to a two-month suspension as his club Auxerre threatened to make the player unavailable for selection in the national team. He was part of the [[France national under-21 football team|France under-21 side]] that won the [[1988 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|1988 U21 European Championship]], scoring a [[hat-trick]] in a quarter-final against the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21 side]] in the process,<ref>{{cite news|title=French in Front|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HZJUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_Y8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6122%2C3804160|date=15 April 1988|work=New Straits Times|accessdate=12 October 2013}}</ref> and shortly after he transferred to [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] for a French record fee (FF22m). Cantona had grown up as a Marseille fan.\n\nIn January 1989 during a friendly game against [[FC Torpedo Moscow|Torpedo Moscow]] he kicked the ball at the crowd, then ripped off and threw away his shirt after being substituted. His club responded by banning him for a month. Just a few months earlier, he had been banned from international matches for one year after insulting the national coach [[Henri Michel]] on TV.<ref name=\"returns\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/manutd/3006409/Cantona-returns-to-Old-Trafford.html |title=Cantona returns to Old Trafford |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=30 May 2001 |accessdate=1 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nHaving struggled to settle at Marseille, Cantona moved to [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] on a six-month loan and then to [[Montpellier H\u00e9rault SC|Montpellier]] on a year-long loan. At Montpellier, he was involved in a fight with teammate [[Jean-Claude Lemoult]] and threw his boots in Lemoult's face. The incident led to six players demanding that Cantona be sacked, but with the support of teammates such as [[Laurent Blanc]] and [[Carlos Valderrama (footballer)|Carlos Valderrama]], the club retained his services, although they banned him from the ground for ten days.<ref>Cantona subsequently played a role in Blanc's arrival at Manchester United in 2001 having boasted about the talent Blanc possessed. \"Cantona returns\", 2001.</ref> Cantona was instrumental as the team went on to win the French Cup and his form persuaded Marseille to take him back.\n\nBack at Marseille, Cantona initially played well under coach [[Gerard Gili]] and his successor [[Franz Beckenbauer]]. However, the Marseille chairman [[Bernard Tapie]] was not satisfied with the results, and replaced Beckenbauer with [[Raymond Goethals]]; Cantona was continually at odds with Goethals and Tapie and, despite helping the team win the [[Ligue 1|French Division 1]] title, he was transferred to [[N\u00eemes Olympique|N\u00eemes]] the following season.\n\nIn December 1991, during a match for N\u00eemes, he threw the ball at the referee, having been angered by one of his decisions. He was summoned to a disciplinary hearing by the [[French Football Federation]] and was banned for one month. Cantona responded by walking up to each member of the hearing committee in turn and calling him an \"idiot\". His ban was increased to two months, and Cantona subsequently announced his retirement from football on 16 December 1991.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zJVUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=R5ADAAAAIBAJ&pg=6927,1151918&dq=eric-cantona&hl=en |title=Cantona packs it in |work=New Straits Times |via=Google News |date=18 December 1991 |accessdate=25 January 2018 }}</ref>\n\nThe France national team coach, [[Michel Platini]], was a fan of Cantona, and persuaded him to make a comeback.

Souness thanked Platini, but declined the offer, citing dressing room harmony as his reason.\n\nAfter being turned down by Liverpool, Cantona was given a trial at [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] when Wednesday manager [[Trevor Francis]] was approached by Platini and Francis' former agent, Dennis Roach. In a 2012 interview Francis explained that he had agreed to take Cantona on as a favour to Roach and Platini, who he knew from his time playing in Italy, and that it was intended as an opportunity for Cantona to put himself in the \"shop window\": Wednesday had only recently been promoted back to the top flight, with most of the squad still being on Second Division-level wages, and the club could not afford to sign him.

Two days later, Wilkinson announced that Leeds intended to complete Cantona's transfer from N\u00eemes for \u00a3900,000.

[[Andreas Buck]] equalised for Stuttgart in the 34th minute, the [[Away goals rule|away goal]] meaning that Leeds needed another four to progress. McAllister scored a penalty just before half-time to make it 2\u20131 to Leeds before Cantona's looping shot in the 66th minute was deflected into his own net by [[G\u00fcnther Sch\u00e4fer]]. Chapman's header at the near post made it 4\u20131 in the 78th minute but Stuttgart remained firm and denied Leeds the decisive fifth goal. However, Leeds received a stroke of luck when it emerged after the match that Stuttgart's coach, [[Christoph Daum]], had fielded four 'foreign' players, one more than allowed. Leeds were awarded a 3\u20130 victory by UEFA, and a play-off match was ordered at the neutral [[Camp Nou]] in Barcelona on 9 October.<ref>Auclair (2009), pp. 225\u20136.</ref>\n\nAn exhausted Leeds then stumbled to a 4\u20132 defeat at [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], with Cantona's form dipping through fatigue and injury.

Cantona was then guilty of \"two dreadful misses\" as [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] knocked them out of the League Cup on 10 November. Despite suffering along with his team, Wilkinson, rather than Cantona, was held responsible, after having to reinvigorate a side with a number of ageing stars. Despite Cantona scoring (with his shoulder) for France against Finland four days later, Wilkinson kept him out of the team, citing an unconvincing excuse of a \"groin strain\", as Leeds pulled off an improbable but resounding 3\u20130 win over Arsenal, ending the Gunners' six-game winning run.<ref>Auclair (2009), p. 234.</ref> Furious at being dropped, Cantona refused to report for training and faxed a transfer request to the club on 24 November, stating a preference to join Manchester United, Liverpool or Arsenal.<ref>Auclair (2009), pp. 234\u20135</ref>\n\n====Manchester United====\n=====Transfer from Leeds United=====\nThe news of Cantona's impending transfer from Leeds to fierce rivals Manchester United was met with hostility from Leeds fans.

Ferguson had identified that his team was in need of a striker, having recently made unsuccessful bids for [[David Hirst (footballer)|David Hirst]], [[Matt Le Tissier]] and [[Brian Deane]], and instructed his chairman to ask whether Cantona was for sale.

The request was turned down and two days later, following a meeting in Paris with Alex Ferguson, he declared that he would remain at the club.

In the absence of regular captain [[Steve Bruce]] due to injury, Cantona wore the armband for the final and took on the captain's responsibility by volleying in the only goal of the game in the 86th minute after Liverpool had failed to clear a corner.

Later in 1998, Cantona organised a match of Manchester United players against other players from around the world in what was originally designed to be a memorial for the victims of the [[Munich Air Disaster]] in 1958 and their families, but which was merged with a [[Testimonial match|testimonial]] for Cantona himself.<ref>http://www.red11.org/mufc/matftest.htm</ref>\n\nIn his 1999 autobiography ''Managing My Life'', Alex Ferguson claimed that Cantona had informed him of his decision to retire from playing within 24 hours of Manchester United's [[1996\u201397 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] semi-final defeat to [[Borussia Dortmund]], though the decision was not made public for almost a month afterwards. During that time, there had been speculation about his future at Manchester United, including talk of a move to [[Real Zaragoza]] of Spain.\n\nReturning to Britain in 2003 to pick up the Overseas Player of the Decade Award at the [[Premier League 10 Seasons Awards]], Cantona said of his premature retirement, \"When you quit football it is not easy, your life becomes difficult.

Platini stated that whilst he was coach, Cantona would be selected for France as long as he was playing competitive top-class football; it was Platini who had initiated Cantona's move to England to restart his career. France qualified for [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 1992]] held in Sweden, but failed to win a single game despite the striking partnership of Cantona and [[Jean-Pierre Papin]]. Platini resigned after the finals to be replaced by [[G\u00e9rard Houllier]].\n\nUnder Houllier, France failed to qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] in the U.S. after losing the final game 2\u20131 at home to [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] when a draw would have sufficed. Houllier resigned and [[Aim\u00e9 Jacquet]] took over. Jacquet began to rebuild the national team in preparation for [[1996 European Football Championship|Euro 96]] and appointed Cantona as captain. Cantona remained captain until the Selhurst Park incident in January 1995. The suspension which resulted from this incident also prevented him from playing in international matches.\n\nBy the time Cantona's suspension had been completed, he had lost his role as the team's playmaker to [[Zinedine Zidane]], as Jacquet had revamped the squad with some new players. Cantona, Papin and [[David Ginola]] lost their places in the squad and were never selected for the French team again, thus missing Euro 96. Though there was media criticism about Cantona's omission, as he was playing his best football in the [[Premier League]], Jacquet stated that the team had done well without Cantona, and that he wanted to keep faith with the players who had taken them so far.<ref>Wightman 2002, p. 198.</ref> In a 2015 interview with French radio network [[France Info]], Cantona stated that had he still been involved with the national side, he would have extended his career to feature in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], held in Cantona's home nation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/barclays-premier-league/story/2626908/cantona-would-have-delayed-retirement-for-1998-world-cup|first=Mark|last=Rodden|title=Man United star Eric Cantona would've delayed retirement for France 1998 WC|work=ESPN FC|date=24 September 2015|accessdate=25 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nCantona still harbours resentment for the people at the head of his national team but also admiration for his adopted football country; at [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]] and the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], he supported England and not France.<ref name=\"blast\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2004/3848181.stm |title=Cantona blasts France |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 June 2004 |accessdate=25 January 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Post-playing career==\n\n===Acting career===\n[[File:Looking for Eric Cannes 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Cantona (far right) at the premiere of [[Ken Loach]]\u2018s film ''[[Looking for Eric]]'' (2009) at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. ]]\nHe focused his later career mostly as an actor in French cinema, having had his first role as a rugby player in ''[[Le bonheur est dans le pr\u00e9]]'', shot during his 1995 suspension from football.

The orientation of the 3.4 V8 engine block is unique in ''Mondial t'' models. Mirroring the two-seater Ferrari V8 vehicles, all 3.0 and 3.2 l engines sit across the car with their crankshaft and [[Cylinder bank|cylinder planes]] [[Transverse engine|transverse]] to the main vehicle axis. The 3.4 l engine in the ''Mondial t'' (and 348 GTB cousin) is rotated ninety degrees to a [[Longitudinal engine|longitudinal]] orientation with respect to the car.<ref name=\"Ferrari-T\"/>\n\nIn the Mondial 8 the V8 employs two valves-per-cylinder, and this increases to [[Multi-valve|four valves-per-cylinder]] for the ''Quattrovalvole'' QV and all later models.<ref name=\"Ferrari-QV\"/> All models feature a cast-alloy intake housing nestled centrally above the engine \"vee\" with [[Inlet manifold|manifold tubing]] running directly to each cylinder.

Instead of the conventional \"H\" [[Gear stick#Shift pattern|shift pattern]], this arrangement (also known as a \"reverse h-gate\") has 1st gear situated to the far left and back, behind reverse. This pattern has been popular with racing gearboxes, as it allows quicker, more direct shifts between 2nd and 3rd, and 4th and 5th, gears. Output from the final drive to the rear wheels is via a pair of short, solid [[drive shaft]]s fitted with [[constant-velocity joint]]s at each end to allow for suspension articulation.\n\nFor these models, clutch actuation is hydraulic, unlike their two-seater cousins' cable systems, and transmission selection is via a rod which extends through the centre chassis tunnel and passes through the engine sump into the transmission housing.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|76}}\n\nFor the Mondial t, the engine and transmission were substantially reconfigured and their orientations rotated by ninety degrees to place the axes of both the engine crankshaft and the transmission input shafts parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal axis. The transmission and final-drive units form a combined [[transaxle]] arrangement fitted to the rear of the engine block, using a design originally derived from [[Ferrari 312T|Ferrari's 312T]] [[Formula 1]] car. Drive from the single-plate clutch enters the gearbox and is turned ninety degrees by [[bevel gear]]s to the main transmission shafts which are aligned transverse to the vehicle. A parallel [[Differential (mechanical device)|crownwheel]] with integral [[Limited-slip differential|limited-slip]] action directs output torque to driveshafts with CV joints at each end. The clutch is hydraulically-actuated, and gear selection is via cable operation.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|76}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-T\"/>\n\nAn \"auto-clutch\" option was available on the Mondial t, developed by French supplier [[Valeo]]. Essentially turning the transmission from a conventional manual to an automated manual, this system retained the conventional manual transmission mechanicals but replaced the normal clutch mechanism with an electrohydraulic one without a foot-operated clutch pedal. Clutch engagement and disengagement on the Valeo unit is triggered by movement of the gear-lever, although the electronic control unit combines data from sources including engine, road-speed and gear selection to warn against, or over-ride, attempted selections outside the specified operating limits.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|76}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-T\"/>\n\n===Suspension and running gear===\n\n[[File:Ferrari Mondial Wheels.png|thumb|Mondial '''8''' and '''QV''' wheel (left)<br/>Mondial '''3.2''' and '''t''' wheel (right)]]\nAlthough based on the two-seater vehicle designs, Mondials are slightly larger overall including having appreciably wider front and rear [[Axle track|track]] dimensions.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|38, 60}} Suspension systems are [[Independent suspension|fully independent]] all-round, comprising unequal-length [[Double wishbone suspension|upper and lower wishbones]], coil-over [[Shock absorber|damper]] units and [[anti-roll bar]]s at each end of the vehicle.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|77\u201378}} Mondial t vehicles include a driver-adjustable selector to set the electronically controlled damper units, providing three choices of [[Ride quality|ride-stiffness]] adjustment.<ref name=\"Ferrari-T\"/>\n\nSteering is a [[rack-and-pinion]] mechanism sitting ahead of the front wheels, unpowered on all 8, QV and 3.2 models. Hydraulic power-assistance was standard on the subsequent Mondial t model. Braking is via four-wheel [[Disc brake|ventilated disks]] with split-circuit vacuum assistance on all vehicles. [[Anti-lock braking]] (ABS) was available as an option in 1987, and it was fitted as standard from 1988.<ref name=\"Ferrari-T\"/>\n\nWheels on all vehicles are of a five-spoke alloy design in a clear-lacquered finish. Two distinct patterns were used: the Mondial 8 and QV models have wheels with a flat centre and pronounced edges to the five spokes, whereas the 3.2 and t models' wheels have a [[Convex curve|convex]] centre and smoother, angled spokes. All wheels feature a yellow circular centre cap bearing Ferrari's black ''[[Cavallino Rampante]]'' rearing-horse logo.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|78\u201389}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-3.2\"/>\n\nMondials until the late 1980s, including all 8 and QV models and many 3.2s, were originally fitted with [[Michelin TRX]] tyres of size 220/55 VR 390 front and 240/55 VR390 rear. TRX tyres require wheels with the proprietary TRX [[Rim (wheel)|rim profile]], meaning all vehicles fitted with such wheels could only utilise TRX-style tyres. Later 3.2 vehicles and the Mondial t reverted to industry-standard wheel designs of size 7x16 front and 8x16 rear, enabling a far wider range of tyre choices to suit the 205/55 VR16 front and 225/55 VR16 rear tyre specifications.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|78\u201379}}\n\n===Interior===\n\n[[File:Ferrari-Mondial-3.2-interior-rear.jpg|thumb|Ferrari 3.2 Coupe interior]]\nThe seats and interior of all Mondial variants are fully trimmed in [[Connolly Leather|Connolly hide]] with the exception of the use of black vinyl for the [[dashboard]] top and upper door linings. Paint, upholstery and carpet colours generally match those available on Ferrari's concurrent two-seater models, with the commonest choices being Rosso Corsa or Rosso Dino (reds), Azzurro (blue) and Nero (black), in combination with beige, tan or black leather. All seats including those in the rear are strongly [[Bucket seat|bucket-shaped]], and fitted with [[Seat belt|inertia-reel seatbelts]].<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|66\u201371}}\n\nA central tunnel for the chassis structure is prominent in both front and rear footwells, and is straddled by a large front [[Center console (automobile)|centre console]] with a polished open-gated gear selector and electronic warning-light panel. Electric windows (the front panes only are opening) and air-conditioning are standard fitments, with their controls on the central console. The [[parking brake|handbrake]] is located outside the driver's seat beside the inner sill, and is a \"drop-down\" design to assist ingress and egress. A three-spoked leather steering wheel is mounted to a [[steering column]] adjustable for reach and rake, behind which is a \"pod-style\" instrument binnacle holding six gauges: speedometer, tachometer, fuel level, water temperature, oil pressure and oil temperature. The Mondial instrumentation is completed with a comprehensive set of warning lights and electronic check panels.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|66\u201373}}\n\n==History==\n\nThe Mondial was, at the time, one of Ferrari's most commercially successful models, with over 6,000 examples produced over its thirteen-year run. The Mondial underwent many updates throughout its production with four distinct variants produced: the Mondial 8, Mondial QV, Mondial 3.2, and Mondial t. All but the Mondial 8 were released in both coup\u00e9 and cabriolet (convertible) body form.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|58\u201360}}\n\nStarting with the Mondial 8 [[coup\u00e9]] launched in 1980, the vehicle which served as sole V8-engined [[Grand Touring]] or \"GT\" vehicle within the Ferrari range proved to be a disappointment to some Ferrari enthusiasts. With a body that was larger, heavier and less [[Automotive aerodynamics|aerodynamically efficient]] than the equivalent two-seater models, combined with the introduction of tougher [[emission standards]] which significantly dropped power outputs, overall vehicle performance inevitably decreased. In addition, Ferrari responded to new safety requirements, especially in the U.S., with large, black, over-dominant bumpers which were considered to have negatively affected the external design. The fact that the Mondial 8 was a significantly more expensive vehicle than its better-performing two-seater [[Ferrari 308 GTB#GTBi|308 GTBi]] sister somewhat compounded the situation.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|58\u201360}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-8\"/>\n\nFerrari acted quickly just two years later in 1982 to address the straight-line performance issues, by upgrading the engine with a new [[Multi-valve|four-valve head]]. This model, the Mondial Quattrovalvole or QV, shared its engine with the contemporary two-seaters [[Ferrari 308 GTB#GTBi and quattrovalvole|308 GTB/GTS QV]]. A new [[cabriolet]] version was also introduced at this time, a body style which would be carried forward through all subsequent Mondial models.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|58\u201360}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-QV\"/>\n\nThe next evolution was the Mondial 3.2 produced from 1985, which saw the engine grow in [[Displacement (engine)|displacement]] and power, and both the internal and external styling significantly refreshed. This car has enjoyed strong popularity within the Mondial range due to it being a good all-round performer and one of the last Ferraris to have the relatively straightforward maintenance provided by the [[Ferrari 328]] engine and transmission configuration.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|58\u201360}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-3.2\"/>\n\nThe final Mondial variant was the Mondial t, released in 1989. This contained some of the biggest changes in the Mondial history, with an even-larger {{convert|3.4|l|cuin|abbr=on}} engine, a substantial update to the exterior styling and interior [[ergonomics]], and with an entirely new, albeit more complex to service,  [[powertrain]]. Overall the Mondial t is considered the best vehicle in the range regarding overall performance and refinement, although it is often noted that this comes at the cost of greater maintenance.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|58\u201360}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-T\"/>\n\nProduction of the Mondial ceased in 1993, with a total of 6,149 vehicles from all variants having been manufactured.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|79}}\n\n==Mondial 8==<!-- This section is linked from [[Ferrari]] -->\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Mondial 8\n| image = Ferrari Mondial 8 in Vlaams-Brabant.JPG\n| production = 1980&ndash;1982\n| body_style = 2+2 [[coupe]]\n| layout = [[Transverse engine|Transverse]], [[mid-engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]]\n| wheelbase = {{Convert|2,650|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{Convert|4,580|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{Convert|1,790|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{Convert|1,250|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{Convert|1,569|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine = 3.0&nbsp;L ''[[Ferrari Dino engine#V8|Tipo F106B]]'' [[fuel injection|FI]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n}}\nThe first Mondial iteration introduced as the '''Mondial 8''' at the [[Geneva Auto Salon#1980|1980 Geneva Auto Salon]].<ref name=\"affordable\">{{cite book|last=Bluemel|first=Keith|title=Mondial The Affordable Ferrari?|type= Magazine scan|publisher     =Unique Motor Books | isbn= 978-1-84155-584-3| page= 54}}</ref> It was the first Ferrari to depart from the company's simple 3-digit naming scheme, and some reviews found it relatively mild, compared to other Ferraris, regarding performance, drawing criticism from some in the motoring press.<ref name=\"affordable\" /> It used a [[MR layout|mid/rear-mounted]] [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Jetronic|K-Jetronic]] fuel injection [[V8 engine|V8]], shared with the [[Ferrari 308 GTB#GTBi and quattrovalvole|308 GTBi/GTSi]], mounted [[transverse engine|transversely]].

The suspension was the classic layout of unequal-length [[double wishbone]]s and Koni dampers all around.\n\nToday, the Mondial 8 is considered one of the marque's most \"practical\" vehicles, due to its 214&nbsp;hp (160&nbsp;kW), proven drivetrain, four seats, and relatively low cost of maintenance (major services  performed without removing the entire engine/transmission subframe). 703 examples made.  At the time of release, the base price was $64,000 (1981) (or $167,530 in 2015 dollars.)\n\nThe Mondial 8 is often the target of negative perceptions due to what many considered unworthy performance for the marque.\nTwo of the three major US automotive publications (''Road & Track'', ''Car and Driver'') yielded negative performance results that found the Mondial much slower than the [[Ferrari 308 GTB#GTBi and quattrovalvole|308 GTBi/GTSi]]\n\n''[[Road & Track]]'' November 1981<ref name=\"roadandtrack.com\"/>*(Reported faulty shifter)\n0\u201360: 9.4s\n1/4 Mile: 17.1s\n\n''[[Car and Driver]]'' November 1981<ref name=\"caranddriver.com\"/>*(Pre-production model)\n0\u201360: 9.3s\n1/4 Mile: 16.9s\n\nIn contradistinction, ''[[Motor Trend]]'' yielded better performance numbers nearing the [[Ferrari 308 GTB#GTBi and quattrovalvole|308 GTBi/GTSi]]: ''Motor Trend'' November 1981<ref name=\"MotorTrend\">{{cite web|url=http://alexachua.com/1981_mt.pdf |title=Ferrari Mondial 8 Review |publisher=motortrend.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-15}}</ref>\n0\u201360: 8.2\n1/4 Mile: 16.3\n\nMondial 8\nProduction started: 1980.\nProduction ended: 1982.\nTotal production: 703 (145 Right Hand Drive) \u2013 147 Imported to US/CA\nFirst serial number: 31075.\nLast serial number: 41727.\n[[File:Ferrari Mondial 8 RB.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of Mondial 8]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Mondial Quattrovalvole==<!-- This section is linked from [[Ferrari]] -->\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Mondial QV (''Quattrovalvole'')\n| image = Lancia Motor Club Goodwood Track Day 2010 IMG 9907 - Flickr - tonylanciabeta.jpg\n| production = 1982&ndash;1985\n| body_style = 2+2 [[coupe]]<br/> 2+2 [[Cabriolet (automobile)|cabriolet]]\n| layout = [[Transverse engine|Transverse]], [[mid-engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]]\n| engine = 3.0&nbsp;L ''[[Ferrari Dino engine#V8|Tipo F105A]]'' [[Multi-valve|32V]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n| wheelbase = {{Convert|2,650|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{Convert|4,580|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{Convert|1,790|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{Convert|1,260|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{Convert|1,555|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}<br/> {{Convert|1,607|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} (Cabriolet)\n}}\nThe first Mondial engine, although a [[DOHC]] design, used just two valves per cylinder.

The introduction of the Cabriolet saw the popularity of the Mondial rise, particularly in the American market, where a convertible option was highly desirable. The Cabriolet has the added distinction of being the only four-seat, [[RMR layout|mid-rear engine]], convertible automobile ever manufactured in [[Production car|regular production]]. 629 units were produced between 1983 and 1985, making this the rarest version of the Mondial.\n\nMondial QV Cabriolet\nProduction started: 1983.\nProduction ended: 1985.\nTotal production: 629 (27 Right Hand Drive) \u2013 282 Imported to US/CA\nFirst serial number: 47247.\nLast serial number: 59163.\n[[File:1983 or 84 Ferrari Mondial qv rear.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of Mondial Quattrovalvole]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Mondial 3.2==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Ferrari]] -->\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Mondial 3.2\n| image = Ferrari-Mondial-3.2-side.jpg\n| production = 1985&ndash;1988\n| body_style = 2+2 [[coupe]]<br/> 2+2 [[Cabriolet (automobile)|cabriolet]]\n| layout = [[Transverse engine|Transverse]], [[mid-engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]]\n| wheelbase = {{Convert|2,650|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{Convert|4,535|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{Convert|1,795|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{Convert|1,235|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<br/>{{Convert|1,265|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (Cabriolet)\n| weight = {{Convert|1,540|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}<br/> {{Convert|1,607|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} (Cabriolet)\n| engine = 3.2&nbsp;L ''[[Ferrari Dino engine#V8|Tipo F105C]]'' [[multivalve|4v]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n}}\nLike the new [[Ferrari 328]], the Mondial's engine grew in both bore and stroke to 3.2&nbsp;L (3,185&nbsp;cc) in 1985.

The 3.2 also boasted a major interior update, with a more ergonomic layout and a more rounded instrument binnacle. Later cars, from 1987 onwards, also sported [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS brakes]]. Fuel injection remained the primarily mechanical Bosch K-Jetronic (CIS) with an O<sub>2</sub> sensor in the exhaust providing feedback to a simple computer for mixture trimming via a pulse modulated frequency valve that regulated control fuel pressure. The ignition system was Marelli Microplex, with electronic advance control and one distributor per bank of the [[V8 engine|V8]]. The 1988 Mondial 3.2 would be the final model year that retained the relatively low maintenance costs of the 308/328 drivetrain, allowing major service items like timing belt and clutch replacement performed with the engine/transmission package still in the car.\n\n3.2 Mondial Coupe\nProduction started: 1985.\nProduction ended: 1988.\nTotal production: 987 (91 Right Hand Drive) - 87 Imported to US/CA\nFirst serial number: 59165.\nLast serial number: 79671.\n\n3.2 Mondial Cabriolet\nProduction started: 1985.\nProduction ended: 1988.\nTotal production: 810, (57 Right Hand Drive) - 449 Imported to US/CA\nFirst serial number: 59393.\nLast serial number: 78895.\n\n[[File:Ferrari Mondial 3.2 Cabriolet in NJ.jpg|thumb|left|Ferrari Mondial 3.2 Cabriolet]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Mondial t==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Mondial t\n| image = Mondial_t_1.jpg\n| production = 1988&ndash;1993 (MY 1989-1993) Coupe: 858 (45 RHD)<br>43 Imported to USA/Canada <BR>Cabriolet: 1,017 (51 RHD)<br>379 Imported to USA\n| body_style = 2+2 [[coupe]]<br/> 2+2 [[Cabriolet (automobile)|cabriolet]]\n| layout = [[Longitudinal engine|Longitudinal]], [[mid-engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]]\n| engine = 3.4&nbsp;L ''[[Ferrari Dino engine#V8|Tipo F119D/G]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]<br />Valeo&nbsp;[[Semi-automatic transmission|auto-manual]]\n| wheelbase = {{Convert|2,650|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{Convert|4,535|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{Convert|1,810|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{Convert|1,235|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{Convert|1,560|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}<br/> {{Convert|1,570|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} (Cabriolet)\n}}\n[[File:Ferrari Mondial t 002.JPG|thumb|right|Mondial t coupe]]\n\nThe final Mondial evolution was 1989's '''Mondial t''' (Coupe and Cabriolet). It was a substantially changed model, \"spearhead of a new generation of V8 Ferraris\", according to ''[[Road & Track]]'' magazine. It was visually different from preceding Mondial models, the most recognizable being the redesign of the air intakes to a smaller rectangular shape. Additionally, the door-handles were of a visually different design, as were the front and rear bumpers which became body colored. New front and rear wings cover wider tracks and are re-profiled to a fuller shape compared to previous models, which feature a rolled lip.\n\nThe 't' called attention to the car's new engine/transmission layout: the previously transverse engine mounted [[longitudinal engine|longitudinal]]ly while the gearbox remained transverse, thus forming a 't'. The 't' suffix was also homage to the first use of a transverse transmission by Ferrari in the highly successful [[Ferrari 312T]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topspeed.com/cars/ferrari/1989-1993-ferrari-mondial-t-ar79488.html|title=1989 - 1993 Ferrari Mondial T Review @ Top Speed|website=Top Speed|language=en|access-date=2017-08-21}}</ref> driven by [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|F1 World Champion]] [[Niki Lauda]]. By adopting this layout, a longer engine could be mounted lower in the chassis, improving handling dramatically. The 't' configuration was used by Ferrari's [[Formula One]] cars of the 1980s, and would be the standard for the marque's future mid-engined V8 cars, beginning with the [[Ferrari 348|348]], introduced later in the year. The transverse manual gearbox fitted with a [[Limited Slip Differential]] with a twin-plate clutch design with bevel gears driving the wheels. Later in production, an [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission| electromechanical manual transmission]] termed \"Valeo\" was available as an option; while shifting was using a traditional gearshift, the clutch was automatically actuated without a clutch pedal.\n\nThe new layout saw the engine and transmission mounted on a removable subframe; the assembly removed from the underside of the vehicle for maintenance. This process is necessary for timing belt replacement, making this a costly procedure for the owner who does not have a lift. On the other hand, the clutch was now located at the very rear of the drive train. This arrangement makes clutch replacement and service a simple, inexpensive, and readily owner-doable proposition.\n\nThe engine was up to 3.4&nbsp;L (3405&nbsp;cc) and 300&nbsp;hp (224&nbsp;kW). The engine controlled by [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Motronic|Motronic DME 2.5]] (later DME 2.7) electronic engine management that integrated [[Fuel injection|EFI]] and ignition control into a single computer unit. Two of these used in the car: one for each bank of the engine. Engine lubrication upgraded to a dry-sump system.\n\nThe \"t\" was home to other Ferrari firsts: It used power assisted steering for the first time and had a 3-position electronically controlled suspension for a variable tradeoff between ride quality and road holding. It also had standard [[antilock braking system]].\n\nThe Mondial t represented the most substantial upgrade to the Mondial model line in performance and handling since its introduction in 1980. The \"t\" offered greater performance while retaining a mid-engined layout and a practical packaging layout, and was once again, favorably received.\n\nThe Mondial's chassis would underpin a new generation of 2-seat Ferraris, right up to the [[Ferrari 360]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mondialt.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/autocar0509_large.jpg|title=Steve Cropley}}</ref>, but the 2+2 Mondial would end production just four and a half years later in 1993. However, the \"t\" layout of the engine and transaxle, adapted from Ferrari's Formula One cars, continues to be used in mid-engined V8 model Ferraris to date, albeit with a more sophisticated chassis.\n\nThe company has not produced a mid-engined 2+2 car since then, leaving the 2+2 configuration to the more classic front-engined design starting with the [[Ferrari 456|456]] in 1992.  As of 2018, the V12 [[Ferrari GTC4Lusso|GTC4Lusso]] and both the twin-turbocharged V8 [[Ferrari GTC4Lusso T |GTC4Lusso T]] and [[Ferrari Portofino|Portofino]] are the company's only 4-seat vehicle offerings, but both of these are front engined, leaving the Mondial t as the most modern 4-seat, mid-engined, Ferrari yet produced in 25 years.\n\nMondial t Coupe:\n*Production started: 1988.\n*Production ended: 1993.\n*Total production: 858  (45 Right Hand Drive) - 43 Imported to US/CA\n*First serial number: 79596.\n*Last serial number: 97698.\n\nMondial t Cabriolet:\n*Production started: 1989.\n*Production ended: 1993.\n*Total production: 1,017 (51 Right Hand Drive) - 379 Imported to US/CA\n*First serial number: 80399.\n*Last serial number: 97733.\n\n===PPG Indy Pace Car===\nA Mondial-t was manufactured exclusively by Ferrari for [[PPG Industries]] to use as a [[safety car|pace car]] for the [[Champ Car|PPG Indy Car World Series]].

Historical negative commentary fall under four categories: performance, reliability, price and aesthetics.\n\nIn regards to performance, there was a question of the straight line speed for only the first model, the United States variant (which had additional performance-inhibiting emissions control equipment) of the Mondial 8 (80-82).  The United States variant of the Mondial 8 represents only 147 (or 2%) of the over 6,000 examples produced during the vehicle's lifetime.  There were three formal road tests for the United States variant of the Mondial 8 in 1980.  Two trials (Car and Driver/Road & Track) lamented straight line speed, one (Motor Trend) test applauded it.<ref name=\"MotorTrend\" />  Handling is universally praised by the press at the time for all models (including the Mondial 8) and straight-line performance on par with other exotics for all subsequent iterations.  \n\nReliability is another common critique.  The Mondial 8, QV, and 3.2 lines shares the exact powertrain and many parts as the 308/328, both regarded as the more reliable Ferrari.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/news/c12-0606-buyers-guide-1975-1989-ferrari-308-302-gtb-gts/|title=308/328 Buyer's Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe Mondial is often described as the 'entry-level' Ferrari.  The reality is the Mondial was substantially more expensive than the 308/328 when new.\n\nThe view of the Mondial's aesthetics has always been a matter of debate.  Given the subjective nature of visual design, it is the one criticism that has merit based only on personal judgment.\n\n''I think it's Ferrari's most elegant car...the Mondial's shape is perfect...In short, the Mondial is the one Ferrari that causes heads to turn in appreciation rather than shock.''\n\n-John Phillips III of Automobile 1987<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alexachua.com/1987_auto.pdf|title=Automobile Mondial 3.2 Review|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n''The styling of the Ferrari Mondial Coupe indeed of most Ferraris is best described as timeless; the Pininfarina penned lines still look fresh after eleven years and have influenced the design of sports cars from Detroit to Tokyo''.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nJohn Davis\n\n-MotorWeek\n\n''\"At its launch in 1980, the Mondial 8 was criticized for its styling, weight and lacklustre performance, but time has been kind to the eight-cylinder Fezza.

Instead of the conventional \"H\" [[Gear stick#Shift pattern|shift pattern]], this arrangement (also known as a \"reverse h-gate\") has 1st gear situated to the far left and back, behind reverse. This pattern has been popular with racing gearboxes, as it allows quicker, more direct shifts between 2nd and 3rd, and 4th and 5th, gears. Output from the final drive to the rear wheels is via a pair of short, solid [[drive shaft]]s fitted with [[constant-velocity joint]]s at each end to allow for suspension articulation.\n\nFor these models, clutch actuation is hydraulic, unlike their two-seater cousins' cable systems, and transmission selection is via a rod which extends through the centre chassis tunnel and passes through the engine sump into the transmission housing.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|76}}\n\nFor the Mondial t, the engine and transmission were substantially reconfigured and their orientations rotated by ninety degrees to place the axes of both the engine crankshaft and the transmission input shafts parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal axis. The transmission and final-drive units form a combined [[transaxle]] arrangement fitted to the rear of the engine block, using a design originally derived from [[Ferrari 312T|Ferrari's 312T]] [[Formula 1]] car. Drive from the single-plate clutch enters the gearbox and is turned ninety degrees by [[bevel gear]]s to the main transmission shafts which are aligned transverse to the vehicle. A parallel [[Differential (mechanical device)|crownwheel]] with integral [[Limited-slip differential|limited-slip]] action directs output torque to driveshafts with CV joints at each end. The clutch is hydraulically-actuated, and gear selection is via cable operation.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|76}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-T\"/>\n\nAn \"auto-clutch\" option was available on the Mondial t, developed by French supplier [[Valeo]]. Essentially turning the transmission from a conventional manual to an automated manual, this system retained the conventional manual transmission mechanicals but replaced the normal clutch mechanism with an electrohydraulic one without a foot-operated clutch pedal. Clutch engagement and disengagement on the Valeo unit is triggered by movement of the gear-lever, although the electronic control unit combines data from sources including engine, road-speed and gear selection to warn against, or over-ride, attempted selections outside the specified operating limits.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|76}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-T\"/>\n\n===Suspension and running gear===\n\n[[File:Ferrari Mondial Wheels.png|thumb|Mondial '''8''' and '''QV''' wheel (left)<br/>Mondial '''3.2''' and '''t''' wheel (right)]]\nAlthough based on the two-seater vehicle designs, Mondials are slightly larger overall including having appreciably wider front and rear [[Axle track|track]] dimensions.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|38, 60}} Suspension systems are [[Independent suspension|fully independent]] all-round, comprising unequal-length [[Double wishbone suspension|upper and lower wishbones]], coil-over [[Shock absorber|damper]] units and [[anti-roll bar]]s at each end of the vehicle.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|77\u201378}} Mondial t vehicles include a driver-adjustable selector to set the electronically controlled damper units, providing three choices of [[Ride quality|ride-stiffness]] adjustment.<ref name=\"Ferrari-T\"/>\n\nSteering is a [[rack-and-pinion]] mechanism sitting ahead of the front wheels, unpowered on all 8, QV and 3.2 models. Hydraulic power-assistance was standard on the subsequent Mondial t model. Braking is via four-wheel [[Disc brake|ventilated disks]] with split-circuit vacuum assistance on all vehicles. [[Anti-lock braking]] (ABS) was available as an option in 1987, and it was fitted as standard from 1988.<ref name=\"Ferrari-T\"/>\n\nWheels on all vehicles are of a five-spoke alloy design in a clear-lacquered finish. Two distinct patterns were used: the Mondial 8 and QV models have wheels with a flat centre and pronounced edges to the five spokes, whereas the 3.2 and t models' wheels have a [[Convex curve|convex]] centre and smoother, angled spokes. All wheels feature a yellow circular centre cap bearing Ferrari's black ''[[Cavallino Rampante]]'' rearing-horse logo.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|78\u201389}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-3.2\"/>\n\nMondials until the late 1980s, including all 8 and QV models and many 3.2s, were originally fitted with [[Michelin TRX]] tyres of size 220/55 VR 390 front and 240/55 VR390 rear. TRX tyres require wheels with the proprietary TRX [[Rim (wheel)|rim profile]], meaning all vehicles fitted with such wheels could only utilise TRX-style tyres. Later 3.2 vehicles and the Mondial t reverted to industry-standard wheel designs of size 7x16 front and 8x16 rear, enabling a far wider range of tyre choices to suit the 205/55 VR16 front and 225/55 VR16 rear tyre specifications.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|78\u201379}}\n\n===Interior===\n\n[[File:Ferrari-Mondial-3.2-interior-rear.jpg|thumb|Ferrari 3.2 Coupe interior]]\nThe seats and interior of all Mondial variants are fully trimmed in [[Connolly Leather|Connolly hide]] with the exception of the use of black vinyl for the [[dashboard]] top and upper door linings. Paint, upholstery and carpet colours generally match those available on Ferrari's concurrent two-seater models, with the commonest choices being Rosso Corsa or Rosso Dino (reds), Azzurro (blue) and Nero (black), in combination with beige, tan or black leather. All seats including those in the rear are strongly [[Bucket seat|bucket-shaped]], and fitted with [[Seat belt|inertia-reel seatbelts]].<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|66\u201371}}\n\nA central tunnel for the chassis structure is prominent in both front and rear footwells, and is straddled by a large front [[Center console (automobile)|centre console]] with a polished open-gated gear selector and electronic warning-light panel. Electric windows (the front panes only are opening) and air-conditioning are standard fitments, with their controls on the central console. The [[parking brake|handbrake]] is located outside the driver's seat beside the inner sill, and is a \"drop-down\" design to assist ingress and egress. A three-spoked leather steering wheel is mounted to a [[steering column]] adjustable for reach and rake, behind which is a \"pod-style\" instrument binnacle holding six gauges: speedometer, tachometer, fuel level, water temperature, oil pressure and oil temperature. The Mondial instrumentation is completed with a comprehensive set of warning lights and electronic check panels.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|66\u201373}}\n\n==History==\n\nThe Mondial was, at the time, one of Ferrari's most commercially successful models, with over 6,000 examples produced over its thirteen-year run. The Mondial underwent many updates throughout its production with four distinct variants produced: the Mondial 8, Mondial QV, Mondial 3.2, and Mondial t. All but the Mondial 8 were released in both coup\u00e9 and cabriolet (convertible) body form.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|58\u201360}}\n\nStarting with the Mondial 8 [[coup\u00e9]] launched in 1980, the vehicle which served as sole V8-engined [[Grand Touring]] or \"GT\" vehicle within the Ferrari range proved to be a disappointment to some Ferrari enthusiasts. With a body that was larger, heavier and less [[Automotive aerodynamics|aerodynamically efficient]] than the equivalent two-seater models, combined with the introduction of tougher [[emission standards]] which significantly dropped power outputs, overall vehicle performance inevitably decreased. In addition, Ferrari responded to new safety requirements, especially in the U.S., with large, black, over-dominant bumpers which were considered to have negatively affected the external design. The fact that the Mondial 8 was a significantly more expensive vehicle than its better-performing two-seater [[Ferrari 308 GTB#GTBi|308 GTBi]] sister somewhat compounded the situation.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|58\u201360}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-8\"/>\n\nFerrari acted quickly just two years later in 1982 to address the straight-line performance issues, by upgrading the engine with a new [[Multi-valve|four-valve head]]. This model, the Mondial Quattrovalvole or QV, shared its engine with the contemporary two-seaters [[Ferrari 308 GTB#GTBi and quattrovalvole|308 GTB/GTS QV]]. A new [[cabriolet]] version was also introduced at this time, a body style which would be carried forward through all subsequent Mondial models.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|58\u201360}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-QV\"/>\n\nThe next evolution was the Mondial 3.2 produced from 1985, which saw the engine grow in [[Displacement (engine)|displacement]] and power, and both the internal and external styling significantly refreshed. This car has enjoyed strong popularity within the Mondial range due to it being a good all-round performer and one of the last Ferraris to have the relatively straightforward maintenance provided by the [[Ferrari 328]] engine and transmission configuration.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|58\u201360}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-3.2\"/>\n\nThe final Mondial variant was the Mondial t, released in 1989. This contained some of the biggest changes in the Mondial history, with an even-larger {{convert|3.4|l|cuin|abbr=on}} engine, a substantial update to the exterior styling and interior [[ergonomics]], and with an entirely new, albeit more complex to service,  [[powertrain]]. Overall the Mondial t is considered the best vehicle in the range regarding overall performance and refinement, although it is often noted that this comes at the cost of greater maintenance.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|58\u201360}}<ref name=\"Ferrari-T\"/>\n\nProduction of the Mondial ceased in 1993, with a total of 6,149 vehicles from all variants having been manufactured.<ref name=\"Bluemel1\"/>{{rp|79}}\n\n==Mondial 8==<!-- This section is linked from [[Ferrari]] -->\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Mondial 8\n| image = Ferrari Mondial 8 in Vlaams-Brabant.JPG\n| production = 1980&ndash;1982\n| body_style = 2+2 [[coupe]]\n| layout = [[Transverse engine|Transverse]], [[mid-engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]]\n| wheelbase = {{Convert|2,650|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{Convert|4,580|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{Convert|1,790|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{Convert|1,250|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{Convert|1,569|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine = 3.0&nbsp;L ''[[Ferrari Dino engine#V8|Tipo F106B]]'' [[fuel injection|FI]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n}}\nThe first Mondial iteration introduced as the '''Mondial 8''' at the [[Geneva Auto Salon#1980|1980 Geneva Auto Salon]].<ref name=\"affordable\">{{cite book|last=Bluemel|first=Keith|title=Mondial The Affordable Ferrari?|type= Magazine scan|publisher     =Unique Motor Books | isbn= 978-1-84155-584-3| page= 54}}</ref> It was the first Ferrari to depart from the company's simple 3-digit naming scheme, and some reviews found it relatively mild, compared to other Ferraris, regarding performance, drawing criticism from some in the motoring press.<ref name=\"affordable\" /> It used a [[MR layout|mid/rear-mounted]] [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Jetronic|K-Jetronic]] fuel injection [[V8 engine|V8]], shared with the [[Ferrari 308 GTB#GTBi and quattrovalvole|308 GTBi/GTSi]], mounted [[transverse engine|transversely]]. The engine used in the 1973 [[Ferrari Dino#Dino 308 GT4|''Dino'' 308 GT4]]. The K-Jetronic system is mechanical, with a high-pressure pump which streams fuel continuously to the injectors; it does not have a computer, just a few relays to handle the cold start sequence etc.\nThe chassis was also based on the [[Ferrari GT4|308 GT4]], but with a {{convert|100|mm|in|adj=mid|-longer|1|abbr=on}} wheelbase at {{convert|2650|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The suspension was the classic layout of unequal-length [[double wishbone]]s and Koni dampers all around.\n\nToday, the Mondial 8 is considered one of the marque's most \"practical\" vehicles, due to its 214&nbsp;hp (160&nbsp;kW), proven drivetrain, four seats, and relatively low cost of maintenance (major services  performed without removing the entire engine/transmission subframe). 703 examples made.  At the time of release, the base price was $64,000 (1981) (or $167,530 in 2015 dollars.)\n\nThe Mondial 8 is often the target of negative perceptions due to what many considered unworthy performance for the marque.\nTwo of the three major US automotive publications (''Road & Track'', ''Car and Driver'') yielded negative performance results that found the Mondial much slower than the [[Ferrari 308 GTB#GTBi and quattrovalvole|308 GTBi/GTSi]]\n\n''[[Road & Track]]'' November 1981<ref name=\"roadandtrack.com\"/>*(Reported faulty shifter)\n0\u201360: 9.4s\n1/4 Mile: 17.1s\n\n''[[Car and Driver]]'' November 1981<ref name=\"caranddriver.com\"/>*(Pre-production model)\n0\u201360: 9.3s\n1/4 Mile: 16.9s\n\nIn contradistinction, ''[[Motor Trend]]'' yielded better performance numbers nearing the [[Ferrari 308 GTB#GTBi and quattrovalvole|308 GTBi/GTSi]]: ''Motor Trend'' November 1981<ref name=\"MotorTrend\">{{cite web|url=http://alexachua.com/1981_mt.pdf |title=Ferrari Mondial 8 Review |publisher=motortrend.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-15}}</ref>\n0\u201360: 8.2\n1/4 Mile: 16.3\n\nMondial 8\nProduction started: 1980.\nProduction ended: 1982.\nTotal production: 703 (145 Right Hand Drive) \u2013 147 Imported to US/CA\nFirst serial number: 31075.\nLast serial number: 41727.\n[[File:Ferrari Mondial 8 RB.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of Mondial 8]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Mondial Quattrovalvole==<!-- This section is linked from [[Ferrari]] -->\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Mondial QV (''Quattrovalvole'')\n| image = Lancia Motor Club Goodwood Track Day 2010 IMG 9907 - Flickr - tonylanciabeta.jpg\n| production = 1982&ndash;1985\n| body_style = 2+2 [[coupe]]<br/> 2+2 [[Cabriolet (automobile)|cabriolet]]\n| layout = [[Transverse engine|Transverse]], [[mid-engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]]\n| engine = 3.0&nbsp;L ''[[Ferrari Dino engine#V8|Tipo F105A]]'' [[Multi-valve|32V]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n| wheelbase = {{Convert|2,650|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{Convert|4,580|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{Convert|1,790|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{Convert|1,260|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{Convert|1,555|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}<br/> {{Convert|1,607|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} (Cabriolet)\n}}\nThe first Mondial engine, although a [[DOHC]] design, used just two valves per cylinder.

Fuel injection remained the primarily mechanical Bosch K-Jetronic (CIS) with an O<sub>2</sub> sensor in the exhaust providing feedback to a simple computer for mixture trimming via a pulse modulated frequency valve that regulated control fuel pressure.

The 1988 Mondial 3.2 would be the final model year that retained the relatively low maintenance costs of the 308/328 drivetrain, allowing major service items like timing belt and clutch replacement performed with the engine/transmission package still in the car.\n\n3.2 Mondial Coupe\nProduction started: 1985.\nProduction ended: 1988.\nTotal production: 987 (91 Right Hand Drive) - 87 Imported to US/CA\nFirst serial number: 59165.\nLast serial number: 79671.\n\n3.2 Mondial Cabriolet\nProduction started: 1985.\nProduction ended: 1988.\nTotal production: 810, (57 Right Hand Drive) - 449 Imported to US/CA\nFirst serial number: 59393.\nLast serial number: 78895.\n\n[[File:Ferrari Mondial 3.2 Cabriolet in NJ.jpg|thumb|left|Ferrari Mondial 3.2 Cabriolet]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Mondial t==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Mondial t\n| image = Mondial_t_1.jpg\n| production = 1988&ndash;1993 (MY 1989-1993) Coupe: 858 (45 RHD)<br>43 Imported to USA/Canada <BR>Cabriolet: 1,017 (51 RHD)<br>379 Imported to USA\n| body_style = 2+2 [[coupe]]<br/> 2+2 [[Cabriolet (automobile)|cabriolet]]\n| layout = [[Longitudinal engine|Longitudinal]], [[mid-engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]]\n| engine = 3.4&nbsp;L ''[[Ferrari Dino engine#V8|Tipo F119D/G]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]<br />Valeo&nbsp;[[Semi-automatic transmission|auto-manual]]\n| wheelbase = {{Convert|2,650|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{Convert|4,535|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{Convert|1,810|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{Convert|1,235|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{Convert|1,560|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}<br/> {{Convert|1,570|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} (Cabriolet)\n}}\n[[File:Ferrari Mondial t 002.JPG|thumb|right|Mondial t coupe]]\n\nThe final Mondial evolution was 1989's '''Mondial t''' (Coupe and Cabriolet). It was a substantially changed model, \"spearhead of a new generation of V8 Ferraris\", according to ''[[Road & Track]]'' magazine. It was visually different from preceding Mondial models, the most recognizable being the redesign of the air intakes to a smaller rectangular shape. Additionally, the door-handles were of a visually different design, as were the front and rear bumpers which became body colored. New front and rear wings cover wider tracks and are re-profiled to a fuller shape compared to previous models, which feature a rolled lip.\n\nThe 't' called attention to the car's new engine/transmission layout: the previously transverse engine mounted [[longitudinal engine|longitudinal]]ly while the gearbox remained transverse, thus forming a 't'. The 't' suffix was also homage to the first use of a transverse transmission by Ferrari in the highly successful [[Ferrari 312T]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topspeed.com/cars/ferrari/1989-1993-ferrari-mondial-t-ar79488.html|title=1989 - 1993 Ferrari Mondial T Review @ Top Speed|website=Top Speed|language=en|access-date=2017-08-21}}</ref> driven by [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|F1 World Champion]] [[Niki Lauda]]. By adopting this layout, a longer engine could be mounted lower in the chassis, improving handling dramatically. The 't' configuration was used by Ferrari's [[Formula One]] cars of the 1980s, and would be the standard for the marque's future mid-engined V8 cars, beginning with the [[Ferrari 348|348]], introduced later in the year. The transverse manual gearbox fitted with a [[Limited Slip Differential]] with a twin-plate clutch design with bevel gears driving the wheels. Later in production, an [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission| electromechanical manual transmission]] termed \"Valeo\" was available as an option; while shifting was using a traditional gearshift, the clutch was automatically actuated without a clutch pedal.\n\nThe new layout saw the engine and transmission mounted on a removable subframe; the assembly removed from the underside of the vehicle for maintenance. This process is necessary for timing belt replacement, making this a costly procedure for the owner who does not have a lift. On the other hand, the clutch was now located at the very rear of the drive train. This arrangement makes clutch replacement and service a simple, inexpensive, and readily owner-doable proposition.\n\nThe engine was up to 3.4&nbsp;L (3405&nbsp;cc) and 300&nbsp;hp (224&nbsp;kW). The engine controlled by [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Motronic|Motronic DME 2.5]] (later DME 2.7) electronic engine management that integrated [[Fuel injection|EFI]] and ignition control into a single computer unit. Two of these used in the car: one for each bank of the engine. Engine lubrication upgraded to a dry-sump system.\n\nThe \"t\" was home to other Ferrari firsts: It used power assisted steering for the first time and had a 3-position electronically controlled suspension for a variable tradeoff between ride quality and road holding. It also had standard [[antilock braking system]].\n\nThe Mondial t represented the most substantial upgrade to the Mondial model line in performance and handling since its introduction in 1980. The \"t\" offered greater performance while retaining a mid-engined layout and a practical packaging layout, and was once again, favorably received.\n\nThe Mondial's chassis would underpin a new generation of 2-seat Ferraris, right up to the [[Ferrari 360]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mondialt.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/autocar0509_large.jpg|title=Steve Cropley}}</ref>, but the 2+2 Mondial would end production just four and a half years later in 1993. However, the \"t\" layout of the engine and transaxle, adapted from Ferrari's Formula One cars, continues to be used in mid-engined V8 model Ferraris to date, albeit with a more sophisticated chassis.\n\nThe company has not produced a mid-engined 2+2 car since then, leaving the 2+2 configuration to the more classic front-engined design starting with the [[Ferrari 456|456]] in 1992.  As of 2018, the V12 [[Ferrari GTC4Lusso|GTC4Lusso]] and both the twin-turbocharged V8 [[Ferrari GTC4Lusso T |GTC4Lusso T]] and [[Ferrari Portofino|Portofino]] are the company's only 4-seat vehicle offerings, but both of these are front engined, leaving the Mondial t as the most modern 4-seat, mid-engined, Ferrari yet produced in 25 years.\n\nMondial t Coupe:\n*Production started: 1988.\n*Production ended: 1993.\n*Total production: 858  (45 Right Hand Drive) - 43 Imported to US/CA\n*First serial number: 79596.\n*Last serial number: 97698.\n\nMondial t Cabriolet:\n*Production started: 1989.\n*Production ended: 1993.\n*Total production: 1,017 (51 Right Hand Drive) - 379 Imported to US/CA\n*First serial number: 80399.\n*Last serial number: 97733.\n\n===PPG Indy Pace Car===\nA Mondial-t was manufactured exclusively by Ferrari for [[PPG Industries]] to use as a [[safety car|pace car]] for the [[Champ Car|PPG Indy Car World Series]].

Historical negative commentary fall under four categories: performance, reliability, price and aesthetics.\n\nIn regards to performance, there was a question of the straight line speed for only the first model, the United States variant (which had additional performance-inhibiting emissions control equipment) of the Mondial 8 (80-82).  The United States variant of the Mondial 8 represents only 147 (or 2%) of the over 6,000 examples produced during the vehicle's lifetime.  There were three formal road tests for the United States variant of the Mondial 8 in 1980.  Two trials (Car and Driver/Road & Track) lamented straight line speed, one (Motor Trend) test applauded it.<ref name=\"MotorTrend\" />  Handling is universally praised by the press at the time for all models (including the Mondial 8) and straight-line performance on par with other exotics for all subsequent iterations.  \n\nReliability is another common critique.  The Mondial 8, QV, and 3.2 lines shares the exact powertrain and many parts as the 308/328, both regarded as the more reliable Ferrari.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/news/c12-0606-buyers-guide-1975-1989-ferrari-308-302-gtb-gts/|title=308/328 Buyer's Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe Mondial is often described as the 'entry-level' Ferrari.  The reality is the Mondial was substantially more expensive than the 308/328 when new.\n\nThe view of the Mondial's aesthetics has always been a matter of debate.  Given the subjective nature of visual design, it is the one criticism that has merit based only on personal judgment.\n\n''I think it's Ferrari's most elegant car...the Mondial's shape is perfect...In short, the Mondial is the one Ferrari that causes heads to turn in appreciation rather than shock.''\n\n-John Phillips III of Automobile 1987<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alexachua.com/1987_auto.pdf|title=Automobile Mondial 3.2 Review|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n''The styling of the Ferrari Mondial Coupe indeed of most Ferraris is best described as timeless; the Pininfarina penned lines still look fresh after eleven years and have influenced the design of sports cars from Detroit to Tokyo''.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nJohn Davis\n\n-MotorWeek\n\n''\"At its launch in 1980, the Mondial 8 was criticized for its styling, weight and lacklustre performance, but time has been kind to the eight-cylinder Fezza.

They were great cities of prosperity, power and dominance over the world, but due to their impious nature, Maya's cities were destroyed by god [[Tripurantaka]], an aspect of [[Shiva]]. The three cities were made of iron, silver and gold and were located on earth, in the sky and in heaven, respectively.\n\n==History of Tripura==\n===Penances of the sons of Taraka===\nFollowing the death of [[Tarakasura]], who was killed by [[Kartikeya]], his sons [[Tripurasura|Tarakaksha, Vidyunmali and Kamalaksha]] undertook severe penances by which they pleased Lord [[Brahma]]. They requested that they may become immortal. Resisting it, Brahma said to them that nothing can be immortal. Then Tarakaksha, Vidyunmali and Kamalaksha asked to be blessed with impregnable fortresses, which would be everlasting. However, as Brahma told them that nothing could be everlasting, they requested that the destruction of the cities could be brought about by a single arrow only, on the hope that it was impossible for anyone to shoot such an arrow, save Lord [[Shiva]], of whom they were great devotees. Brahma then blessed them that such fortresses would be constructed.\n\n===The construction of the three cities===\nThe three cities which comprised Tripura were distributed thus:\n*The lowest, with walls of Iron, located on earth,\n*The second, with walls of silver, located in the sky, and\n*The third, with walls of gold, located in heaven.\n\nThe three cities were mobile and moved in such a way that they would never be in a single line, except for a few moments in around a thousand years, when the [[Nakshatra]] [[Pushya]] would be in conjunction with the moon. Tarakasura's sons were thus reassured that they were safe, as it would be an extremely difficult task to destroy such impregnable cities, which aligned only momentarily, by a single arrow.\n\nAsuras from everywhere began to flock to Tripura to live there.\n\n===Forebodings of the fall of Tripura===\n[[File:Devas praying Shankara to Destroy Tripura or The three cities.jpg|thumb|Devas praying Shankara to Destroy Tripura or The three cities]]\nAfter several years of joy, the inherent evil tendencies of the [[Asura]]s surfaced once again and they began to oppress the good and torment the noble. In the meantime, Mayasura was engaged in the worship of [[Shiva]]. The rest of the demons attacked sages and the [[deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] and shattered the peace of the worlds. Finally, when [[Indra]] and the rest of the Devas despondently approached Lord [[Brahma]] for respite, Lord [[Brahma]] redirected them to [[Shiva]] and also informed them of the vulnerability of Tripura to a single arrow. Lord [[Shiva]] promised to help them and the Devas returned to combat the Asuras in a mighty war. They were also assisted by [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]], the leader of Lord [[Shiva]]'s [[Gana]]s. Even though Vidyunmali was slain by Nandi, and several other [[Asura]]s were killed in the war, they were revived by water in the pool of Tripura, which had magical powers.\n\n===The destruction of Tripura===\nAs the war raged on, Devas continued to struggle to match the Asuras, who used their magical powers to great effect in the war. One day the three cities aligned. Shiva ordered that a chariot be made from which he would battle the three demons. \n\nThe war-chariot designed for Shiva was different. The Earth or [[Prithvi]] became the chariot with the Sun and Moon its wheels. Brahma was holding the reins. [[Mount Meru]] became the bow and the serpent [[Vasuki]] was the bow string. [[Vishnu]] was the arrow, and [[Agni]] was the tip of the arrow. [[Vayu]] was inside the feathers on rear of the arrow. All other Devas had their own places and forms in the chariot. Just as the cities aligned, when the Pushya Nakshatra positioned appropriately, Lord [[Shiva]] was about to strung the mighty bow, the [[Pinaka (Hinduism)|Pinaka]] with the arrow, the Devas were overjoyed that Tripura was going to be destroyed because of them (because they were part of the war-chariot, without which Shiva cannot destroy).\n\nLord Shiva, knowing what the Devas were thinking, did not fire the arrow and just smiled. All the three [[puram]]s were burned immediately. Shocked at this act, Brahma pleaded that Devas thought wrong and that Shiva should forgive and release the arrow, or else the Devas would have a permanent bad name and the reason behind making this chariot would become meaningless. Shiva then fired the arrow on the already burning Cities.\n\nWhen Lord shiva seated on the chariot before heading to war, chariot was unable to move forward, Lord Vishnu took form as bull and dragged the chariot and then became the bull flag on top of chariot. After destroying three cities Lord Shiva started tandava nritya on debris which is also called as \"Tripura Nasha Nartana\".\n\nThe Devas then understood:\n\n1. Shiva can take the power of anyone/anything because it is his power that is already existing in first place.\n<br />\n2. Even though the boon granted was \"one-arrow-one-shot and cities should be destroyed\", Shiva has the ultimate power to rule them over.\n<br />\n3. Lord Shiva does not require a huge Chariot with Meru as bow, Vishnu as arrow etc. He could simply destroy/create anything even without moving his eyes. \n\nThe \"smile and burn\" act of Shiva in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] is beautifully called as \"sirinthuppurameritha peruman\" (\"\u0b9a\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bbf\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc1\u0bb0\u0bae\u0bc6\u0bb0\u0bbf\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4 \u0baa\u0bc6\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0bcd\")(God who laughed and burned the three purams)\n\n===Mayasura Protected===\nLord Shiva immediately regretted his act, since he had forgotten to protect Maya, a great devotee of his. Realising this, [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] raced ahead of the arrow and informed Maya of the impending doom. Instantly, Maya fled Tripura, leaving behind the great city he had constructed, which was immediately reduced to ashes, along with its inhabitants, the [[Asura]]s, by the great arrow of Shiva. This destruction of Tripura, led to the [[Appellation (disambiguation)|appellation]] [[Tripurantaka]] (\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092a\u0941\u0930\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0915), for Shiva.\n\n==References==\n*[[Matsya Purana]]\n*[[Shiva Purana]]\n\n{{HinduMythology}}\n\n[[Category:Locations in Hindu mythology]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|Tripura Sundari}}\n{{unreferenced|date=October 2018}}\n[[File:Shiva Tripurantaka.jpg|thumb|350px|Here, the five headed Tripurantaka is seen pointing an arrow towards the Tripura (rightmost top corner) with the bow made of mount Meru, the serpent Vasuki is seen as its string.

Tarakasura's sons were thus reassured that they were safe, as it would be an extremely difficult task to destroy such impregnable cities, which aligned only momentarily, by a single arrow.\n\nAsuras from everywhere began to flock to Tripura to live there.\n\n===Forebodings of the fall of Tripura===\n[[File:Devas praying Shankara to Destroy Tripura or The three cities.jpg|thumb|Devas praying Shankara to Destroy Tripura or The three cities]]\nAfter several years of joy, the inherent evil tendencies of the [[Asura]]s surfaced once again and they began to oppress the good and torment the noble. In the meantime, Mayasura was engaged in the worship of [[Shiva]]. The rest of the demons attacked sages and the [[deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] and shattered the peace of the worlds. Finally, when [[Indra]] and the rest of the Devas despondently approached Lord [[Brahma]] for respite, Lord [[Brahma]] redirected them to [[Shiva]] and also informed them of the vulnerability of Tripura to a single arrow. Lord [[Shiva]] promised to help them and the Devas returned to combat the Asuras in a mighty war. They were also assisted by [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]], the leader of Lord [[Shiva]]'s [[Gana]]s. Even though Vidyunmali was slain by Nandi, and several other [[Asura]]s were killed in the war, they were revived by water in the pool of Tripura, which had magical powers.\n\n===The destruction of Tripura===\nAs the war raged on, Devas continued to struggle to match the Asuras, who used their magical powers to great effect in the war. One day the three cities aligned. Shiva ordered that a chariot be made from which he would battle the three demons. \n\nThe war-chariot designed for Shiva was different. The Earth or [[Prithvi]] became the chariot with the Sun and Moon its wheels. Brahma was holding the reins. [[Mount Meru]] became the bow and the serpent [[Vasuki]] was the bow string. [[Vishnu]] was the arrow, and [[Agni]] was the tip of the arrow. [[Vayu]] was inside the feathers on rear of the arrow. All other Devas had their own places and forms in the chariot. Just as the cities aligned, when the Pushya Nakshatra positioned appropriately, Lord [[Shiva]] was about to strung the mighty bow, the [[Pinaka (Hinduism)|Pinaka]] with the arrow, the Devas were overjoyed that Tripura was going to be destroyed because of them (because they were part of the war-chariot, without which Shiva cannot destroy).\n\nLord Shiva, knowing what the Devas were thinking, did not fire the arrow and just smiled. All the three [[puram]]s were burned immediately. Shocked at this act, Brahma pleaded that Devas thought wrong and that Shiva should forgive and release the arrow, or else the Devas would have a permanent bad name and the reason behind making this chariot would become meaningless. Shiva then fired the arrow on the already burning Cities.\n\nWhen Lord shiva seated on the chariot before heading to war, chariot was unable to move forward, Lord Vishnu took form as bull and dragged the chariot and then became the bull flag on top of chariot. After destroying three cities Lord Shiva started tandava nritya on debris which is also called as \"Tripura Nasha Nartana\".\n\nThe Devas then understood:\n\n1. Shiva can take the power of anyone/anything because it is his power that is already existing in first place.\n<br />\n2. Even though the boon granted was \"one-arrow-one-shot and cities should be destroyed\", Shiva has the ultimate power to rule them over.\n<br />\n3. Lord Shiva does not require a huge Chariot with Meru as bow, Vishnu as arrow etc. He could simply destroy/create anything even without moving his eyes. \n\nThe \"smile and burn\" act of Shiva in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] is beautifully called as \"sirinthuppurameritha peruman\" (\"\u0b9a\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bbf\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc1\u0bb0\u0bae\u0bc6\u0bb0\u0bbf\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4 \u0baa\u0bc6\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0bcd\")(God who laughed and burned the three purams)\n\n===Mayasura Protected===\nLord Shiva immediately regretted his act, since he had forgotten to protect Maya, a great devotee of his. Realising this, [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] raced ahead of the arrow and informed Maya of the impending doom. Instantly, Maya fled Tripura, leaving behind the great city he had constructed, which was immediately reduced to ashes, along with its inhabitants, the [[Asura]]s, by the great arrow of Shiva. This destruction of Tripura, led to the [[Appellation (disambiguation)|appellation]] [[Tripurantaka]] (\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092a\u0941\u0930\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0915), for Shiva.\n\n==References==\n*[[Matsya Purana]]\n*[[Shiva Purana]]\n\n{{HinduMythology}}\n\n[[Category:Locations in Hindu mythology]]\n", "name_user": "Thaatguy07", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe construction of the three cities", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripura_(mythology)"}
