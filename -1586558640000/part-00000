Three major railways, the [[Shanghai\u2013Kunming Railway]], the [[Jiaozuo\u2013Liuzhou Railway]], and the [[Chongqing\u2013Huaihua Railway]], intersect in the city. Through these railways Huaihua has connections to almost all major Chinese cities. Passenger trains are served by the [[Huaihua Railway Station]].\n\nHuaihua is on the route of [[G65 Baotou-Maoming Expressway]], which connects it with Chongqing to the northwest. It is also on the route of [[G60 Shanghai\u2013Kunming Expressway]], which connects it with [[Guiyang]] to the west, and [[Changsha]] to the east. Other roads that run through the city include [[China National Highway 209]] and [[China National Highway 320]].\n\nBy air, Huaihua is served by [[Zhijiang Airport]], located some 31 kilometers from

Currently, all new pharmaceuticals undergo rigorous animal testing before being licensed for human use. Tests on pharmaceutical products involve:\n*''metabolic tests'', investigating [[pharmacokinetics]]\u2014how drugs are absorbed, [[Drug metabolism|metabolized]] and [[Excretion|excreted]] by the body when introduced [[Wiktionary:oral|orally]], [[intravenous]]ly, intraperitoneally, [[intramuscular]]ly, or [[Transdermal patch|transdermally]].\n*''toxicology tests'', which gauge [[acute toxicity|acute]], sub-acute, and [[chronic toxicity]]. Acute toxicity is studied by using a rising dose until signs of toxicity become apparent. Current European legislation demands that \"acute toxicity tests must be carried out in two or more mammalian species\" covering \"at least two different routes of administration\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0083:EN:HTML |title=EU Directive 2001/83/EC, p. 44 |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu}}</ref> Sub-acute toxicity is where the drug is given to the animals for four to six weeks in doses below the level at which it causes rapid poisoning, in order to discover if any toxic [[drug metabolism|drug metabolites]] build up over time.

Dreijer was one half of the [[electronic music]] duo [[the Knife]], formed with their brother [[Olof Dreijer]]. They were previously the vocalist and guitarist of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Honey Is Cool]]. Dreijer released their [[Fever Ray (album)|debut solo album]] under the alias '''Fever Ray''' in January 2009. Their second studio album, ''[[Plunge (album)|Plunge]]'', under the same alias, was released in October 2017.\n\nDreijer's vocal style is notable for both shrill and deep tones, and also the use of multitracked vocals, with different uses of pitch-shifting technology on each track, creating an intricate and mysterious effect. Visually, they employ the use of masks, face and body paint, intricate costumes, and other theatrical elements in photo shoots, videos and live performances, during which they often perform behind a gauze screen that partially obscures the audience's view.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hogan |first=Marc |url=https://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/7631-fever-ray/ |title=Interviews: Fever Ray |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=30 March 2009 |accessdate=6 April 2009}}</ref> \n\n==Early life==\nDreijer was born on 7 April 1975 in [[Gothenburg, Sweden]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.tidskriftenful.se/mag.php?m=ful&issid=1238376339&text=1238432522 |title=P\u00e5 h\u00f6ga klackar \u00f6ver mossan \u2013 Fever Ray |language=Swedish |journal=Ful |issue=1 |year=2009 |accessdate=11 January 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"guardian2017\"/> They started playing guitar at the age of ten, which led to the founding of the band [[Honey Is Cool]].

Dreijer was one half of the [[electronic music]] duo [[the Knife]], formed with their brother [[Olof Dreijer]]. They were previously the vocalist and guitarist of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Honey Is Cool]]. Dreijer released their [[Fever Ray (album)|debut solo album]] under the alias '''Fever Ray''' in January 2009. Their second studio album, ''[[Plunge (album)|Plunge]]'', under the same alias, was released in October 2017.\n\nDreijer's vocal style is notable for both shrill and deep tones, and also the use of multitracked vocals, with different uses of pitch-shifting technology on each track, creating an intricate and mysterious effect. Visually, they employ the use of masks, face and body paint, intricate costumes, and other theatrical elements in photo shoots, videos and live performances, during which they often perform behind a gauze screen that partially obscures the audience's view.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hogan |first=Marc |url=https://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/7631-fever-ray/ |title=Interviews: Fever Ray |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=30 March 2009 |accessdate=6 April 2009}}</ref> \n\n==Early life==\nDreijer was born on 7 April 1975 in [[Gothenburg, Sweden]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.tidskriftenful.se/mag.php?m=ful&issid=1238376339&text=1238432522 |title=P\u00e5 h\u00f6ga klackar \u00f6ver mossan \u2013 Fever Ray |language=Swedish |journal=Ful |issue=1 |year=2009 |accessdate=11 January 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"guardian2017\"/> They started playing guitar at the age of ten, which led to the founding of the band [[Honey Is Cool]].

The forum is a political platform that has a centrist ideology which aims to support the minority rights of the Germans from Romania.\n\nSince 1989, the DFDR/FDGR has competed both in [[Elections in Romania|local and legislative elections]], cooperating in the process with two historical parties of the [[Politics of Romania|Romanian politics]], namely the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL) and the [[Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party]] (PN\u021aCD), most notably at local administrative level, in cities such as Sibiu ({{lang-de|Hermannstadt}}), Timi\u0219oara ({{lang-de|Temeschburg}}), or [[Baia Mare]] ({{lang-de|Frauenbach}}). The DFDR/FDGR also adheres to a pro-monarchic stance regarding the matter of monarchy restoration in Romania.\n\nUntil 1 January 2007 (i.e. the date of accession of Romania to the [[European Union]]), the DFDR/FDGR was also an observing member of the [[European Parliament]], briefly affiliated with the [[European People's Party group|European People's Party]] ({{lang-de|Europ\u00e4ische Volkspartei}}), between January and November of the same year.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Liceul Samuel von Brukenthal.jpg|thumb|Samuel von Brukenthal National College in Sibiu ({{lang-de|Hermannstadt}})]]\n\nIn [[Bucharest]] there are two German-language schools, namely [[Deutsche Schule Bukarest]] and [[Deutsches Goethe-Kolleg Bukarest]].

All those parties are not politically active anymore.\n\nInstead, the entire German-speaking community in post-1989 Romania is represented at official level by the [[Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania]] ({{lang-de|Demokratisches Forum der Deutschen in Rum\u00e4nien}}, {{lang-ro|Forumul Democrat al Germanilor din Rom\u00e2nia}}). The forum is a political platform that has a centrist ideology which aims to support the minority rights of the Germans from Romania.\n\nSince 1989, the DFDR/FDGR has competed both in [[Elections in Romania|local and legislative elections]], cooperating in the process with two historical parties of the [[Politics of Romania|Romanian politics]], namely the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL) and the [[Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party]] (PN\u021aCD), most notably at local administrative level, in cities such as Sibiu ({{lang-de|Hermannstadt}}), Timi\u0219oara ({{lang-de|Temeschburg}}), or [[Baia Mare]] ({{lang-de|Frauenbach}}). The DFDR/FDGR also adheres to a pro-monarchic stance regarding the matter of monarchy restoration in Romania.\n\nUntil 1 January 2007 (i.e. the date of accession of Romania to the [[European Union]]), the DFDR/FDGR was also an observing member of the [[European Parliament]], briefly affiliated with the [[European People's Party group|European People's Party]] ({{lang-de|Europ\u00e4ische Volkspartei}}), between January and November of the same year.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Liceul Samuel von Brukenthal.jpg|thumb|Samuel von Brukenthal National College in Sibiu ({{lang-de|Hermannstadt}})]]\n\nIn [[Bucharest]] there are two German-language schools, namely [[Deutsche Schule Bukarest]] and [[Deutsches Goethe-Kolleg Bukarest]].

He succeeded his brother [[Batu Khan]] of the Blue Horde (West) and was responsible for the first official establishment of Islam in a khanate of the [[Mongol Empire]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Devin |last=De Weese |title=Islamization and Native Religion in the Golden Horde |location= |publisher=Penn State Press |year=1994 |isbn=0-271-01073-8 |page=3 }}</ref> He allied with the Egyptian [[Mamluk]]s against another Mongol khanate based in [[Persia]], the [[Ilkhanate]]. Berke supported [[Ariq B\u00f6ke]] in the [[Toluid Civil War]], but did not intervene militarily in the war because he was occupied in his own war.\n\n==Name==\nBerke is a name used by both [[Turkic peoples]] and [[Mongols]]. In the [[Mongolian language]] \"Berkh\" literally means \"strong\". \"Berk\" also has many meanings like \"solid\", \"powerful\", and \"in power\" in the [[Old Turkic language]].\n\n==Birth==\nBerke was born to [[Jochi]], the eldest son of [[Genghis Khan]]. There is no clear consensus regarding the year of Berke's birth. [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] ambassadors visiting him in 663 [[Hijri|AH]] (1264/5) described him as fifty-six years old. This gives him a birth date somewhere between 1207 and 1209. However, contemporary Persian chronicler [[Minhaj-i-Siraj|Juzjani]] claims that Berke was born during the [[Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia]], which took place between 1219 and 1221.<ref>{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Jackson |title=The Mongols and the Islamic World: From Conquest to Conversion |year=2017 |location= |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-12533-7 |page=348 }}</ref>\n\nThe latter claim was used to support the argument of historian [[Jean Richard (historian)|Jean Richard]] that Berke's mother was Khan-Sultan (or Sultan Khatun), the captured daughter of [[Muhammad II of Khwarazm]]. The marriage between Jochi and Khan-Sultan took place in 1220, allowing Berke's birth to be no earlier than 1221.<ref>{{cite book |first=Anne F. |last=Broadbridge |title=Women and the Making of the Mongol Empire |year=2018 |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-108-42489-9 |pages=231\u2013232 }}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nBerke was present, with several of his brothers, at the inauguration of his uncle [[\u00d6gedei]] as [[Great Khan]] in 1229.\n\nIn 1236, Berke joined his brothers [[Orda Khan|Orda]], Sinkur, and [[Shiban]] and an assortment of cousins under the leadership of [[Batu Khan]] in a vast army, comprising some 150,000 soldiers, which marched from [[Siberia]] and into the territory of the Muslim [[Volga Bulgaria|Volga Bulgars]] and [[Kipchaks]], whom they subdued. Batu and [[Subutai]] sent Berke to the country north of the [[Caucasus]] to conquer the Kipchaks there. Next they devastated the principalities of [[Ryazan]] and [[Suzdal]] in 1237, and marched further into Russia. During the winter of 1238-39, Berke defeated the Kipchaks and imprisoned the chief of the [[Merkit]]s. He afterwards subdued the steppe watered by the [[Kuma River (Russia)|Kuma]] and the [[Terek River|Terek]] west of the Caspian Sea.\n\nBerke further served under his brother during the invasion of Europe, fighting at the [[Battle of the Mohi]], where the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] army was decimated.  When [[\u00d6gedei Khan]] died, and all the princes of the blood were summoned to return to [[Mongolia]] to select a Great Khan, Berke and his brothers joined Batu in the kurultai to elect a new Great Khan.\n\n== Conversion to Islam ==\nBerke Khan converted to  Islam in the city of Bukhara in 1252. When he was at [[Saray-J\u00fck]], Berke met a [[caravan (travellers)|caravan]] from [[Bukhara]] and questioned them about their faith. Berke was convinced to convert by the caravan travellers and became a Muslim. Berke then persuaded his brother Tukh-timur to convert to [[Islam]] as well.\n\nIn 1248 Batu sent Berke, along with his brother Tukh-timur, to Mongolia in order to install [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] on the throne of Great Khan. When he arrived, he invited the [[Chagatai khans|Chagatai]] and Ogedeyd families several times. That is why Berke conducted the [[kurultai]] in 1251 and had M\u00f6ngke enthroned. Berke organized everything under strict conditions.\n\n==Assuming the Golden Horde==\n[[File:Golden Horde 1389.svg|right|400px|thumb|The domains of the Golden Horde in 1389. The gold star shows the location of New [[Sarai (city)|Sarai]], capital of the [[Golden Horde]].]]\n\nWhen Batu died in 1255, he was briefly succeeded by his sons [[Sartaq Khan]] and [[Ulaghchi]], before Berke assumed leadership in 1257. He was an able ruler and succeeded in maintaining and stabilizing the Golden Horde, the western khanate of the Mongol Empire. During his government, the Mongols finally defeated the rebellion of [[Danylo of Halych]] and made a [[Second Mongol invasion of Poland|second attack against Poland]] and [[Lithuania]], led by general [[Burundai]] (Lublin, Zawichost, Sandomierz, Krak\u00f3w and Bytom were plundered) in 1259. Also in 1265 there was a raid against [[Bulgaria]] and Byzantine [[Thrace]]. Michael of the [[Byzantine Empire]] also sent much valuable fabric to the Golden Horde as a tribute thereafter.\n\n==Berke-Hulagu War==\n{{Main|Berke\u2013Hulagu war}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BerkeGoldenHorde.jpg|thumb|]] -->\nBerke soon became a devout Muslim. His conversion resulted in the Blue Horde becoming primarily Muslim, although there were still animists and Buddhists among them. Berke was angered by Hulagu's destruction of Baghdad and was determined to deal with [[Hulagu Khan]], who had murdered the Caliph [[Al-Musta'sim]], and whose territorial ambitions in Syria and Egypt threatened Berke's fellow Muslims.\n\nIn the meantime, the Ilkhanates led by [[Kitbuqa]] had fallen out with the crusaders holding the coast of Palestine, and the [[Mamluks]] had secured a pact of neutrality with them, passing through their territory, and destroying the Ilkhanate army at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]]. Kitbuqa was killed. [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Syria]] were regained, the border remaining the [[Tigris]] for the duration of Hulagu's dynasty.  Berke's vow of vengeance against Hulagu had to wait until the latter's return to his lands after the death of [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]].\n \nHulagu returned to his lands by 1262, but instead of being able to avenge his defeats, was drawn into civil war with Berke and the Blue Horde. Berke Khan had promised such a defeat in his rage after Hulagu's sack of Baghdad.\n\nMuslim historian [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] quoted Berke Khan as telling his Mongols and Muslim subjects, in protest at the attack on Baghdad:\n\n:'''\"He (Hulagu) has sacked all the cities of the [[Muslim]]s, and has brought about the death of the [[Caliph]]. With the help of [[Allah|God]] I will call him to account for so much innocent blood.\"''' (see ''The Mongol Warlords'', quoting Rashid al-Din's record of Berke Khan's pronouncement; this quote is also found in ''The Mamluk-Ilkhanid War'')\n\nBefore his succession, he also complained to Batu \"We helped M\u00f6ngke to enthrone. But he forgot who the enemy is or friend is. Now, he is starving the lands of our friend Caliph. It is abject\". It is notable that Berke Khan kept his promise, allying himself with the Mamluks, (Berke sought an alliance with the [[Mamluk]] sultan [[Baibars]] against Hulagu) and when Hulagu returned to his lands in 1262, after the succession was finally settled with Kublai as the last Great Khan, and massed his armies to avenge Ain Jalut and attack the Mamluks, Berke Khan initiated a series of raids in force which drew Hulagu north to meet him. This was the first open conflict between Mongols, and signalled the end of the unified empire.\n\nBut the reasons for the conflict between Berke and Hulagu were both religious and territorial. M\u00f6ngke Khan gave lands in current day [[Azerbaijan]], which had been given to Jochi by [[Genghis Khan]], to his brother Hulagu. Although Berke did not like the situation, he was patient till M\u00f6ngke's death.\n\nBerke at first desisted from fighting Hulagu out of Mongol brotherhood, he said ''Mongols are killed by Mongol swords. If we were united, then we would have conquered all of the world.'' but the economic situation of the Golden Horde due to the actions of the Ilkhanate led him to declare jihad because of the Ilkhanids domination of the wealth of North Iran, and the Ilkhanate's demands for the Golden Horde to not sell slaves to the Mamluks.<ref name=\"Elverskog2011\">{{cite book|author=Johan Elverskog|title=Buddhism and Islam on the Silk Road|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7_4Gr9Q438C&pg=PA186&lpg=PA186#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=6 June 2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-0531-6|pages=186\u2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1262 the conflict turned into open war. Hulagu Khan suffered a severe defeat in an attempted invasion north of the Caucasus in 1263. Hulagu's forces were crushed at the [[Terek River|Terek]] river by Berke's nephew Nogai, forcing Hulagu into retreat; he died in 1265. Also Chagatai Khan [[Alghu]] invaded Khwarizm and annexed Golden Horde lands. Jochid army unsuccessfully tried to halt his advance.\n\nBerke also supported Great Khan claimant [[Ariq B\u00f6ke]] in the [[Toluid Civil War]], and he minted coins in the name of Ariq B\u00f6ke. However Kublai defeated Ariq B\u00f6ke by 1264. Kublai called both Hulagu and Berke to discuss Ariq B\u00f6ke. However, both of them noted that they could not come to the Kurultai at the moment, and the new Kurultai was never held.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAs Berke sought to cross the Kura river to attack Hulagu's son, [[Abaqa Khan]], he fell ill and died sometime between 1266 and 1267.<ref>E.J. Brill's first encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913-1936, Volume 7 By Martijn Theodoor Houtsma, p. 708.</ref> He was succeeded by his grandnephew, [[Mengu-Timur]].

Kruchki</ref> are in agreement that the intervention by Berke against Hulagu saved the remainder of the Holy Land, including Mecca and Jerusalem, from the same fate as Baghdad.{{full citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n== Ancestry ==\n{{see also|Family tree of Genghis Khan}}\n\n{{ahnentafel\n|align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= '''Berke Khan'''\n|2= [[Jochi Khan]]\n|3= Sultan Khatun\n|4= [[Genghis Khan]]\n|5= [[B\u00f6rte|B\u00f6rte Ujin]]\n|6= \n|7= \n|8= [[Yesugei|Yesugei Baghatur]]\n|9= [[Hoelun]]\n|10= Dei Seichen\n|11= Tacchotan\n|12= \n|13= \n|14= \n|15= \n|16= \n|17= \n|18= \n|19= \n|20= \n|21= \n|22= \n|23= \n|24= \n|25= \n|26= \n|27= \n|28= \n|29= \n|30= \n|31= \n}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Khans of the Golden Horde]]\n*[[Berke\u2013Hulagu war]]\n*[[William of Rubruck]]\n*[[Negudar]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Amitai-Preiss, Reuven.

There is no clear consensus regarding the year of Berke's birth. [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] ambassadors visiting him in 663 [[Hijri|AH]] (1264/5) described him as fifty-six years old. This gives him a birth date somewhere between 1207 and 1209. However, contemporary Persian chronicler [[Minhaj-i-Siraj|Juzjani]] claims that Berke was born during the [[Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia]], which took place between 1219 and 1221.<ref>{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Jackson |title=The Mongols and the Islamic World: From Conquest to Conversion |year=2017 |location= |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-12533-7 |page=348 }}</ref>\n\nThe latter claim was used to support the argument of historian [[Jean Richard (historian)|Jean Richard]] that Berke's mother was Khan-Sultan (or Sultan Khatun), the captured daughter of [[Muhammad II of Khwarazm]]. The marriage between Jochi and Khan-Sultan took place in 1220, allowing Berke's birth to be no earlier than 1221.<ref>{{cite book |first=Anne F. |last=Broadbridge |title=Women and the Making of the Mongol Empire |year=2018 |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-108-42489-9 |pages=231\u2013232 }}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nBerke was present, with several of his brothers, at the inauguration of his uncle [[\u00d6gedei]] as [[Great Khan]] in 1229.\n\nIn 1236, Berke joined his brothers [[Orda Khan|Orda]], Sinkur, and [[Shiban]] and an assortment of cousins under the leadership of [[Batu Khan]] in a vast army, comprising some 150,000 soldiers, which marched from [[Siberia]] and into the territory of the Muslim [[Volga Bulgaria|Volga Bulgars]] and [[Kipchaks]], whom they subdued. Batu and [[Subutai]] sent Berke to the country north of the [[Caucasus]] to conquer the Kipchaks there. Next they devastated the principalities of [[Ryazan]] and [[Suzdal]] in 1237, and marched further into Russia. During the winter of 1238-39, Berke defeated the Kipchaks and imprisoned the chief of the [[Merkit]]s. He afterwards subdued the steppe watered by the [[Kuma River (Russia)|Kuma]] and the [[Terek River|Terek]] west of the Caspian Sea.\n\nBerke further served under his brother during the invasion of Europe, fighting at the [[Battle of the Mohi]], where the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] army was decimated.  When [[\u00d6gedei Khan]] died, and all the princes of the blood were summoned to return to [[Mongolia]] to select a Great Khan, Berke and his brothers joined Batu in the kurultai to elect a new Great Khan.\n\n== Conversion to Islam ==\nBerke Khan converted to  Islam in the city of Bukhara in 1252. When he was at [[Saray-J\u00fck]], Berke met a [[caravan (travellers)|caravan]] from [[Bukhara]] and questioned them about their faith. Berke was convinced to convert by the caravan travellers and became a Muslim. Berke then persuaded his brother Tukh-timur to convert to [[Islam]] as well.\n\nIn 1248 Batu sent Berke, along with his brother Tukh-timur, to Mongolia in order to install [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] on the throne of Great Khan. When he arrived, he invited the [[Chagatai khans|Chagatai]] and Ogedeyd families several times. That is why Berke conducted the [[kurultai]] in 1251 and had M\u00f6ngke enthroned. Berke organized everything under strict conditions.\n\n==Assuming the Golden Horde==\n[[File:Golden Horde 1389.svg|right|400px|thumb|The domains of the Golden Horde in 1389. The gold star shows the location of New [[Sarai (city)|Sarai]], capital of the [[Golden Horde]].]]\n\nWhen Batu died in 1255, he was briefly succeeded by his sons [[Sartaq Khan]] and [[Ulaghchi]], before Berke assumed leadership in 1257. He was an able ruler and succeeded in maintaining and stabilizing the Golden Horde, the western khanate of the Mongol Empire. During his government, the Mongols finally defeated the rebellion of [[Danylo of Halych]] and made a [[Second Mongol invasion of Poland|second attack against Poland]] and [[Lithuania]], led by general [[Burundai]] (Lublin, Zawichost, Sandomierz, Krak\u00f3w and Bytom were plundered) in 1259. Also in 1265 there was a raid against [[Bulgaria]] and Byzantine [[Thrace]]. Michael of the [[Byzantine Empire]] also sent much valuable fabric to the Golden Horde as a tribute thereafter.\n\n==Berke-Hulagu War==\n{{Main|Berke\u2013Hulagu war}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BerkeGoldenHorde.jpg|thumb|]] -->\nBerke soon became a devout Muslim. His conversion resulted in the Blue Horde becoming primarily Muslim, although there were still animists and Buddhists among them. Berke was angered by Hulagu's destruction of Baghdad and was determined to deal with [[Hulagu Khan]], who had murdered the Caliph [[Al-Musta'sim]], and whose territorial ambitions in Syria and Egypt threatened Berke's fellow Muslims.\n\nIn the meantime, the Ilkhanates led by [[Kitbuqa]] had fallen out with the crusaders holding the coast of Palestine, and the [[Mamluks]] had secured a pact of neutrality with them, passing through their territory, and destroying the Ilkhanate army at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]]. Kitbuqa was killed. [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Syria]] were regained, the border remaining the [[Tigris]] for the duration of Hulagu's dynasty.  Berke's vow of vengeance against Hulagu had to wait until the latter's return to his lands after the death of [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]].\n \nHulagu returned to his lands by 1262, but instead of being able to avenge his defeats, was drawn into civil war with Berke and the Blue Horde. Berke Khan had promised such a defeat in his rage after Hulagu's sack of Baghdad.\n\nMuslim historian [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] quoted Berke Khan as telling his Mongols and Muslim subjects, in protest at the attack on Baghdad:\n\n:'''\"He (Hulagu) has sacked all the cities of the [[Muslim]]s, and has brought about the death of the [[Caliph]]. With the help of [[Allah|God]] I will call him to account for so much innocent blood.\"''' (see ''The Mongol Warlords'', quoting Rashid al-Din's record of Berke Khan's pronouncement; this quote is also found in ''The Mamluk-Ilkhanid War'')\n\nBefore his succession, he also complained to Batu \"We helped M\u00f6ngke to enthrone. But he forgot who the enemy is or friend is. Now, he is starving the lands of our friend Caliph. It is abject\". It is notable that Berke Khan kept his promise, allying himself with the Mamluks, (Berke sought an alliance with the [[Mamluk]] sultan [[Baibars]] against Hulagu) and when Hulagu returned to his lands in 1262, after the succession was finally settled with Kublai as the last Great Khan, and massed his armies to avenge Ain Jalut and attack the Mamluks, Berke Khan initiated a series of raids in force which drew Hulagu north to meet him. This was the first open conflict between Mongols, and signalled the end of the unified empire.\n\nBut the reasons for the conflict between Berke and Hulagu was not only just religion, but territory as well. M\u00f6ngke Khan gave lands in current day [[Azerbaijan]], which had been given to Jochi by [[Genghis Khan]], to his brother Hulagu. Although Berke did not like the situation, he was patient till M\u00f6ngke's death.\n\nBerke at first desisted from fighting Hulagu out of Mongol brotherhood, he said ''Mongols are killed by Mongol swords. If we were united, then we would have conquered all of the world.'' but the economic situation of the Golden Horde due to the actions of the Ilkhanate led him to declare jihad because of the Ilkhanids domination of the wealth of North Iran, and the Ilkhanate's demands for the Golden Horde to not sell slaves to the Mamluks.<ref name=\"Elverskog2011\">{{cite book|author=Johan Elverskog|title=Buddhism and Islam on the Silk Road|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7_4Gr9Q438C&pg=PA186&lpg=PA186#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=6 June 2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-0531-6|pages=186\u2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1262 the conflict turned into open war. Hulagu Khan suffered a severe defeat in an attempted invasion north of the Caucasus in 1263. Hulagu's forces were crushed at the [[Terek River|Terek]] river by Berke's nephew Nogai, forcing Hulagu into retreat; he died in 1265. Also Chagatai Khan [[Alghu]] invaded Khwarizm and annexed Golden Horde lands. Jochid army unsuccessfully tried to halt his advance.\n\nBerke also supported Great Khan claimant [[Ariq B\u00f6ke]] in the [[Toluid Civil War]], and he minted coins in the name of Ariq B\u00f6ke. However Kublai defeated Ariq B\u00f6ke by 1264. Kublai called both Hulagu and Berke to discuss Ariq B\u00f6ke. However, both of them noted that they could not come to the Kurultai at the moment, and the new Kurultai was never held.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAs Berke sought to cross the Kura river to attack Hulagu's son, [[Abaqa Khan]], he fell ill and died sometime between 1266 and 1267.<ref>E.J. Brill's first encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913-1936, Volume 7 By Martijn Theodoor Houtsma, p. 708.</ref> He was succeeded by his grandnephew, [[Mengu-Timur]]. The policy of alliance with the Mamluks, and containment of the Ilkhanate, was continued by Mengu-Timur. Many historians<ref>Michael Pravdin, Lev Nicholaevich Gumilev, Reuven Amitai-Preiss, N. Kruchki</ref> are in agreement that the intervention by Berke against Hulagu saved the remainder of the Holy Land, including Mecca and Jerusalem, from the same fate as Baghdad.{{full citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n== Ancestry ==\n{{see also|Family tree of Genghis Khan}}\n\n{{ahnentafel\n|align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= '''Berke Khan'''\n|2= [[Jochi Khan]]\n|3= Sultan Khatun\n|4= [[Genghis Khan]]\n|5= [[B\u00f6rte|B\u00f6rte Ujin]]\n|6= \n|7= \n|8= [[Yesugei|Yesugei Baghatur]]\n|9= [[Hoelun]]\n|10= Dei Seichen\n|11= Tacchotan\n|12= \n|13= \n|14= \n|15= \n|16= \n|17= \n|18= \n|19= \n|20= \n|21= \n|22= \n|23= \n|24= \n|25= \n|26= \n|27= \n|28= \n|29= \n|30= \n|31= \n}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Khans of the Golden Horde]]\n*[[Berke\u2013Hulagu war]]\n*[[William of Rubruck]]\n*[[Negudar]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Amitai-Preiss, Reuven.
