A special hosted by [[Joel McHale]] was released on April 12, 2020, with McHale interviewing several of the stars about Exotic and the series itself.\n\nThe series received acclaim from critics, and according to [[Nielsen ratings]], was watched by 34.3 million people over its first ten days of release, ranking as one of Netflix's most successful releases to date.\n\n==Summary==\n{{more sources|date=April 2020|section}}\n[[File:Tiger_at_Big_Cat_Rescue.jpg|right|thumb|[[Big cat|Big cats]], like this [[tiger]] seen at Florida\u2019s [[Big Cat Rescue]] in 2012 run by activist and conservationist [[Carole Baskin]], cannot be ethically released to the wild and instead spend the rest of their lives in cages.]]\nThe series explores the little-known, deeply interconnected society of [[big cat]] conservationists and collectors in America, and the private [[zoo]]s and sanctuaries they have set up for these unusual and deadly animals. The primary subject is [[Joe Exotic]], the eccentric owner of the [[Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park|G.W. Zoo]] in [[Wynnewood, Oklahoma]], and his bitter years-long feud with [[Carole Baskin]], CEO of [[Big Cat Rescue]] in [[Tampa, Florida]]. Baskin presents herself as an [[animal rights]] activist whose mission is to provide a [[Animal sanctuary|sanctuary]] for big cats raised in captivity, but Joe Exotic maintains that she is simply a rival zookeeper whose aim is to eliminate her competition. The two exchange threatening videos, legal allegations, protests, and targeted harassment campaigns, in which [[PETA]] and the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] become involved. Joe Exotic goes so far as to allege that Baskin  [[Disappearance of Don Lewis|murdered her second husband Don Lewis]], who has been [[Missing person|missing]] since 1997.\n\nJoe Exotic's personal life becomes a subject of interest, particularly his unofficial [[Polygamy|three-way]] [[same-sex marriage]] to Travis Maldonado and John Finlay and his subsequent relationships with them and future husband Dillon Passage. His 2016 run for [[President of the United States]] and [[2018 Oklahoma gubernatorial election#Libertarian_primary|2018 run for Governor of Oklahoma]] are documented with the assistance of his campaign manager, Joshua Dial. Producer [[TV_Junkie#Rick_Kirkham|Rick Kirkham]] recounts the rise and fall of \"Joe Exotic TV\", a sort of [[podcast]] that Kirkham was hoping to develop into a TV series until his footage is mysteriously destroyed. The series then records the events leading up to Joe Exotic's conviction under federal [[Contract killing|murder-for-hire]] statutes when it comes to light that he paid a hitman to murder Baskin; his conviction also includes violations of the [[Lacey Act]] and [[Endangered Species Act]], and results in a 22-year federal prison sentence.\n\nOther characters from the exotic animal community are introduced, including [[Bhagavan Antle]], an animal breeder accused of leading a personality cult; Mario Tabraue, a former drug lord who is involved in animal trafficking; Jeff Lowe, a [[Las Vegas]] playboy to whom Joe Exotic turns over his zoo for legal reasons; and James Garretson, who became a confidential [[informant]] for the federal government and a key figure in making the case against Joe Exotic. Former G.W. Zoo employees such as manager John Reinke and animal wrangler Saff Saffery conclude the series by commenting that the animals themselves were forgotten amongst all the interpersonal fighting, and that no party has truly come out victorious.<ref name=\"NYPN\">{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Michael |title=Everything you need to know about Netflix's new Joe Exotic doc, 'Tiger King' |url=https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=[[New York Post]] |issue=March 19, 2020 |publisher=NYP Holdings, Inc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320183106/https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |archive-date=March 20, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |total_width=70 |background=#B60006 |overall= |title= |director= |airdate= |country=U.S. |released=y |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |Title = Not Your Average Joe\n |DirectedBy = [[Eric Goode]] & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = Cult of Personality\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |Title = The Secret\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |Title = Playing with Fire\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |Title = Make America Exotic Again\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |Title = The Noble Thing to Do\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |Title = Dethroned\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 8\n |Title = The Tiger King and I\n |DirectedBy = {{TableTBA|N/A}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|12}}\n |ShortSummary = Special after-show hosted by [[Joel McHale]].\n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the series holds an approval rating of 89% based on 75 reviews, with an average rating of 7.88/10.

collectors such as Exotic, whom Baskin accuses of abusing and exploiting wild animals. A special hosted by [[Joel McHale]] was released on April 12, 2020, with McHale interviewing several of the stars about Exotic and the series itself.\n\nThe series received acclaim from critics, and according to [[Nielsen ratings]], was watched by 34.3 million people over its first ten days of release, ranking as one of Netflix's most successful releases to date.\n\n==Summary==\n{{more sources|date=April 2020|section}}\n[[File:Tiger_at_Big_Cat_Rescue.jpg|right|thumb|[[Big cat|Big cats]], like this [[tiger]] seen at Florida\u2019s [[Big Cat Rescue]] in 2012 run by activist and conservationist [[Carole Baskin]], cannot be ethically released to the wild and instead spend the rest of their lives in cages.]]\nThe series explores the little-known, deeply interconnected society of [[big cat]] conservationists and collectors in America, and the private [[zoo]]s and sanctuaries they have set up for these unusual and deadly animals. The primary subject is [[Joe Exotic]], the eccentric owner of the [[Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park|G.W. Zoo]] in [[Wynnewood, Oklahoma]], and his bitter years-long feud with [[Carole Baskin]], CEO of [[Big Cat Rescue]] in [[Tampa, Florida]]. Baskin presents herself as an [[animal rights]] activist whose mission is to provide a [[Animal sanctuary|sanctuary]] for big cats raised in captivity, but Joe Exotic maintains that she is simply a rival zookeeper whose aim is to eliminate her competition. The two exchange threatening videos, legal allegations, protests, and targeted harassment campaigns, in which [[PETA]] and the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] become involved. Joe Exotic goes so far as to allege that Baskin  [[Disappearance of Don Lewis|murdered her second husband Don Lewis]], who has been [[Missing person|missing]] since 1997.\n\nJoe Exotic's personal life becomes a subject of interest, particularly his unofficial [[Polygamy|three-way]] [[same-sex marriage]] to Travis Maldonado and John Finlay and his subsequent relationships with them and future husband Dillon Passage. His 2016 run for [[President of the United States]] and [[2018 Oklahoma gubernatorial election#Libertarian_primary|2018 run for Governor of Oklahoma]] are documented with the assistance of his campaign manager, Joshua Dial. Producer [[TV_Junkie#Rick_Kirkham|Rick Kirkham]] recounts the rise and fall of \"Joe Exotic TV\", a sort of [[podcast]] that Kirkham was hoping to develop into a TV series until his footage is mysteriously destroyed. The series then records the events leading up to Joe Exotic's conviction under federal [[Contract killing|murder-for-hire]] statutes when it comes to light that he paid a hitman to murder Baskin; his conviction also includes violations of the [[Lacey Act]] and [[Endangered Species Act]], and results in a 22-year federal prison sentence.\n\nOther characters from the exotic animal community are introduced, including [[Bhagavan Antle]], an animal breeder accused of leading a personality cult; Mario Tabraue, a former drug lord who is involved in animal trafficking; Jeff Lowe, a [[Las Vegas]] playboy to whom Joe Exotic turns over his zoo for legal reasons; and James Garretson, who became a confidential [[informant]] for the federal government and a key figure in making the case against Joe Exotic. Former G.W. Zoo employees such as manager John Reinke and animal wrangler Saff Saffery conclude the series by commenting that the animals themselves were forgotten amongst all the interpersonal fighting, and that no party has truly come out victorious.<ref name=\"NYPN\">{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Michael |title=Everything you need to know about Netflix's new Joe Exotic doc, 'Tiger King' |url=https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=[[New York Post]] |issue=March 19, 2020 |publisher=NYP Holdings, Inc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320183106/https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |archive-date=March 20, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |total_width=70 |background=#B60006 |overall= |title= |director= |airdate= |country=U.S. |released=y |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |Title = Not Your Average Joe\n |DirectedBy = [[Eric Goode]] & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = Cult of Personality\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |Title = The Secret\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |Title = Playing with Fire\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |Title = Make America Exotic Again\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |Title = The Noble Thing to Do\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |Title = Dethroned\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 8\n |Title = The Tiger King and I\n |DirectedBy = {{TableTBA|N/A}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|12}}\n |ShortSummary = Special after-show hosted by [[Joel McHale]].\n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the series holds an approval rating of 89% based on 75 reviews, with an average rating of 7.88/10.

Initially making only small batches of meth with his former student [[Jesse Pinkman]] in a [[rolling meth lab]], Walter and Jesse eventually expand to make larger batches of a special blue meth that is incredibly pure and creates high demand. Walter takes on the name \"[[Heisenberg]]\" to mask his identity. Because of his drug-related activities, Walter eventually finds himself at odds with his family, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) through his brother-in-law [[Hank Schrader]], the local gangs, the Mexican drug cartels and their regional distributors, putting his life at risk.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Conception ===\n''Breaking Bad'' was created by [[Vince Gilligan]], who spent several years writing the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] series ''[[The X-Files]]''. Gilligan wanted to create a series in which the [[protagonist]] became the [[antagonist]]. \"Television is historically good at keeping its characters in a self-imposed stasis so that shows can go on for years or even decades,\" he said. \"When I realized this, the logical next step was to think, how can I do a show in which the fundamental drive is toward change?\"<ref name=\"grantland\" /> He added that his goal with Walter White was to turn him from [[Goodbye, Mr. Chips|Mr. Chips]] into [[Tony Montana|Scarface]].<ref name=\"THR\" /><ref name=\"Bowles0713\" /><ref name=\"Ginsberg0716\" /> Gilligan believed the concept of showing the full drastic transformation of a character across the run of a television show was a risky concept and would be difficult to pitch without other powerful factors to support it, such as strong cinematography and acting.<ref name=\"esquire history\"/>\n\nThe show title is a [[Southern United States|Southern]] colloquialism meaning, among other things, \"raising hell\", and was chosen by Gilligan to describe Walter's transformation.<ref name=\"AutoHY-2\" /> According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' entertainment editor Lily Rothman, the term has a broader meaning and is an old phrase which \"connotes more violence than 'raising hell' does&nbsp;... [T]he words possess a wide variety of nuances: to 'break bad' can mean to 'go wild', to 'defy authority', and break the law, to be verbally 'combative, belligerent, or threatening' or, followed by the preposition 'on', 'to dominate or humiliate'.\"<ref name=\"Rothman\" />\n\nThe concept emerged as Gilligan talked with his fellow ''X-Files'' writer [[Thomas Schnauz]] regarding their current unemployment and joked that the solution was for them to put a \"[[Rolling meth lab|meth lab in the back of an RV]] and [drive] around the country cooking meth and making money\".<ref name=\"tease\" />\n\nAfter writing the concept for the show and pilot, Gilligan pitched it to [[Sony Pictures Television]], who became very interested in supporting it. Sony arranged for meetings with the various cable networks. [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] passed on this, as they had already started broadcasting ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]'', a show with similarities to the premise of ''Breaking Bad''.<ref name=\"thr history\"/> While his producers convinced him that the show was different enough to still be successful, Gilligan later stated that he would not have gone forward with the idea had he known about ''Weeds'' earlier.<ref name=\"huffington-weeds\" /> Other networks like [[HBO]] and [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]] also passed on the idea, but eventually [[FX (TV Channel)|FX]] took interest and began initial discussions on producing the pilot.<ref name=\"thr history\">{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/breaking-bad-vince-gilligan-bryan-cranston-347082 |title=Bleak, Brutal, Brilliant 'Breaking Bad': Inside the Smash Hit That Almost Never Got Made |first1=Lacey |last1=Rose |first2=Stacey Wilson |last2=Hunt |date=July 11, 2012 |accessdate=July 1, 2019 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref> At the same time, FX had also started development of ''[[Dirt (TV series)|Dirt]]'', a female-centric crime-based drama series, and with three existing male-centric shows already on the network, FX passed up ''Breaking Bad'' for ''Dirt''.<ref name=\"thr history\"/>\n\nOne of Gilligan's agents spoke to Jeremy Elice, the director of original programming for [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] who was looking for more original shows to add alongside their upcoming ''[[Mad Men]]''. Elice was intrigued, and soon a meeting was set up between Gilligan, Elice, and two programming executives. Gilligan was not optimistic about this meeting, fearing they would just put him off, but instead all three showed great interest, and the meeting ended up establishing how AMC would acquire the rights from FX and set the pilot into production. It took about a year following this meeting before Sony had set up the rights with AMC and production could start.<ref name=\"thr history\"/>\n\n=== Development history ===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| total_width = 400\n| perrow    = 2\n| footer = ''Breaking Bad'' was filmed at various locations across Albuquerque.

Once Gilligan recognized that this would mean \"we'd always have to be avoiding the [[Sandia Mountains]]\" in shots directed toward the east, the story setting was changed to the actual production location.<ref name=\"AutoHY-3\" /><ref name=\"AutoHY-4\" /> It was shot primarily on [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]],<ref name=\"AutoHY-5\" /> with [[Digital cinematography|digital cameras]] employed as needed for additional angles, [[point of view shot]]s and [[time-lapse photography]].<ref name=\"AutoHY-6\" />  ''Breaking Bad'' cost $3 million per episode to produce, higher than the average cost for a basic cable program.<ref name=\"AutoHY-7\" />\n\nAround 2010, AMC had expressed to Sony Pictures Television and Gilligan that they felt that the third season would be the last for ''Breaking Bad''. Sony started to shop the show around, having gained quick interest from the FX network for two more seasons, upon which AMC changed its mind and allowed the show to continue.<ref name=\"thr 20190918\"/> At the same time, [[Netflix]] was starting to aggressively shop for content to add to its service, and arranged a deal with Sony for ''Breaking Bad'' to be available after the airing of the fourth season. However, knowing that AMC had placed ''Breaking Bad'' on a potential cancellation route, Sony pushed to have the show added to the service in time for the fourth season. Because of this, ''Breaking Bad''{{'}}s viewership grew greatly as viewers binged the series on Netflix, helping to assure that a fifth season could be made. The fifth-season premiere had more than double the viewership compared to the fourth season premiere, attributed to the Netflix availability.<ref name=\"thr 20190918\"/> Gilligan thanked Netflix at the Emmy Awards in September 2013 after the series' conclusion for the popularity of the series, saying that Netflix \"kept us on the air\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-10\" />\n\nAs the series progressed, Gilligan and the writing staff of ''Breaking Bad'' made Walter increasingly unsympathetic.<ref name=\"THR\" /> Gilligan said during the run of the series, \"He's going from being a protagonist to an antagonist. We want to make people question who they're pulling for, and why.\"<ref name=\"Bowles0713\" /> Cranston said by the [[Breaking Bad (season 4)|fourth season]], \"I think Walt's figured out it's better to be a pursuer than the pursued. He's well on his way to badass.\"<ref name=\"Ginsberg0716\" />\n\nIn July 2011, Vince Gilligan indicated that he intended to conclude ''Breaking Bad'' at the end of its fifth season.<ref name=\"AutoHY-8\" /> In early August 2011, negotiations began over a deal regarding the fifth and possible final season between the network [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] and [[Sony Pictures Television]], the production company of the series. AMC proposed a shortened fifth season (six to eight episodes, instead of 13) to cut costs, but the producers declined. Sony then approached other cable networks about possibly picking up the show if a deal could not be made.<ref name=\"AutoHY-9\" /> On August 14, 2011, AMC renewed the series for a fifth and final season consisting of 16 episodes.<ref name=\"final season\" />\n\nBefore the series finale, Gilligan said that it was difficult to write for Walter White because the character was so dark and morally questionable: \"I'm going to miss the show when it's over, but on some level, it'll be a relief to not have Walt in my head anymore.\"<ref name=\"Segal0706\" /> Gilligan later said the idea for Walter's character intrigued him so much that he \"didn't really give much thought on how well it would sell\", stating that he would have given up on the premise since it was \"such an odd, dark story\" that could have difficulties being pitched to studios.<ref name=tease /> Ultimately, Gilligan chose to end ''Breaking Bad'' with Walter's death, occurring in-story two years after he had been first been diagnosed with cancer and given two years to live. Gilligan said by the end of the series, \"it feels as if we should adhere to our promise that we explicitly made to our audience\" from the first episode.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/video-vince-gilligan-breaking-bads-639466 |title=Vince Gilligan on 'Breaking Bad's' 'The Searchers' Parallels: 'We Stole From the Best' |first=Sophie |last=Schillaci |date=September 30, 2013 |accessdate=March 7, 2020 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\n{{Quote box |width=30em|align=right|quote=\"You're going to see that underlying humanity, even when he's making the most devious, terrible decisions, and you need someone who has that humanity&nbsp;\u2013 deep down, bedrock humanity&nbsp;\u2013 so you say, watching this show, 'All right, I'll go for this ride.

Cranston played an anti-Semite with a terminal illness who took series co-protagonist [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) hostage. Gilligan said the character had to be simultaneously loathsome and sympathetic, and that \"Bryan alone was the only actor who could do that, who could pull off that trick. And it is a trick. I have no idea how he does it.\"<ref name=\"Segal0706\" /><ref name=\"Sepinwall0306\" /> AMC officials, who were initially reluctant with the casting choice, having known Cranston only as the over-the-top character [[Hal (Malcolm in the Middle)|Hal]] on the comedy series ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'', approached actors [[John Cusack]] and [[Matthew Broderick]] about the role.<ref name=\"AutoHY-11\" /> When both actors declined, the executives were persuaded to cast Cranston after seeing his ''X-Files'' episode.<ref name=\"Rosenblum0313\" />\n\nCranston contributed significantly to the formation and development of the Walter White persona. When Gilligan left much of Walter's past unexplained during the development of the series, the actor wrote his own [[backstory]] for the character.<ref name=\"Segal0706\" /> At the start of the show, Cranston gained 10 pounds to reflect the character's personal decline, and had the natural red highlights of his hair dyed brown. He collaborated with costume designer Kathleen Detoro on a wardrobe of mostly neutral green and brown colors to make the character bland and unremarkable, and worked with makeup artist Frieda Valenzuela to create a mustache he described as \"impotent\" and like a \"dead caterpillar\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-12\" /> Cranston repeatedly identified elements in certain scripts where he disagreed with how the character was handled,<ref name=\"AutoHY-13\" /> and went so far as to call Gilligan directly when he could not work out disagreements with the episode's screenwriters. Cranston has said he was inspired partially by his elderly father for how Walter carries himself physically, which he described as \"a little hunched over, never erect, [as if] the weight of the world is on this man's shoulders.\" In contrast to his character, Cranston has been described as extremely playful on set, with Aaron Paul describing him as \"a kid trapped in a man's body\".<ref name=\"Segal0706\" />\n\n[[Aaron Paul]]'s casting was also initially questioned by production, as Paul looked too old and too much like a \"pretty boy\" to be associated with meth cooking. However, Gilligan reconsidered Paul's skills after seeing his audition and recalling he had also had guest starred on ''The X-Files'' episode \"[[Lord of the Flies (The X-Files)|Lord of the Flies]]\".<ref name=\"thr history\"/> Gilligan originally intended for Pinkman to be killed at the end of ''Breaking Bad''{{'}}s [[Breaking Bad (season 1)|first season]] in a botched drug deal as a plot device to plague Walter White with guilt. However, Gilligan said by the second episode of the season, he was so impressed with Paul's performance that \"it became pretty clear early on that would be a huge, colossal mistake, to kill off Jesse\".<ref name=\"Paley Centre\" /> Similarly, [[Dean Norris]] had shown his ability to be a law enforcement official in ''The X-Files'' episode \"[[F. Emasculata]]\", and was brought on to be Hank Schrader, Walter's brother-in-law and DEA agent.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/how-x-files-gave-birth-784003 |title=How 'X-Files' Gave Birth to 'Breaking Bad' |first=Aaron |last=Couch |date=March 24, 2015 |accessdate=July 17, 2019 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Scientific accuracy ===\n[[Donna Nelson]], a professor of [[organic chemistry]] at the [[University of Oklahoma]], checked scripts and provided dialogue. She also drew [[chemical structure]]s and wrote [[chemical equation]]s which were used as props. According to creator Vince Gilligan,\n\n<blockquote>Dr. Donna Nelson from the University of Oklahoma approached us several seasons back and said, \"I really like this show, and if you ever need help with the chemistry, I'd love to lend a hand.\" She's been a wonderful advisor. We get help wherever we need it, whether it's chemistry, [[electrical engineering]], or [[physics]]. We try to get everything correct. There's no full-time [advisor] on set, but we run certain scenes by these experts first.<ref name=\"AutoHY-14\" /></blockquote>\n\n\"Because Walter White was talking to his students, I was able to dumb down certain moments of description and dialogue in the early episodes which held me until we had some help from some honest-to-God chemists,\" says Gilligan. According to Gilligan, Nelson \"vets our scripts to make sure our chemistry dialogue is accurate and up to date.

On the show, the phenyl-2-propanone (otherwise known as [[phenylacetone]] or P2P) is produced from [[phenylacetic acid]] and [[acetic acid]] using a [[tube furnace]] and [[thorium dioxide]] (ThO<sub>2</sub>) as a [[Catalysis|catalyst]], as mentioned in episodes \"A No Rough-Stuff-Type Deal\" and \"M\u00e1s\".

Critics appreciated the bold visual style adopted by the TV series.

As his shady business progresses, Walter gains a notorious reputation under the name of \"Heisenberg\". Cranston stated that, though he enjoyed doing comedy, he decided he <blockquote>... should really focus on doing something else. But I think any good drama worth its weight always has a sprinkling of comedy in it, because you can ease the tension to an audience when it's necessary, and then build it back up again. Walt White has no clue he's occasionally funny, but as an actor, I recognize when there are comedic moments and opportunities.<ref name=\"AutoHY-18\" /></blockquote>\n* [[Anna Gunn]] as [[Skyler White]]&nbsp;\u2013 Walter's wife who was pregnant with their second child before his diagnosis and who becomes increasingly suspicious of her husband after he begins behaving in unfamiliar ways.

Paul sees Jesse as a funny kid. \"He's just this lost soul&nbsp;\u2013 I don't think he's a bad kid, he just got mixed in the wrong crowd.\" Paul elaborated on the character's background, saying, \"He doesn't come from an abusive, alcoholic background. But maybe he just didn't relate to his father, maybe his father was too strict and too proper for Jesse.\" Paul compared the character's relationship with Walt to ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]''.<ref name=\"AutoHY-20\" />\n* [[Dean Norris]] as [[Hank Schrader]]&nbsp;\u2013 Marie's husband, Walter and Skyler's brother-in-law and a [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent. At the beginning of the series, Hank was intended to be the \"comic relief\". Norris, who has played several policemen before in film and television, stated: <blockquote>Having played so many cops, I've talked with a lot of technical advisers, so I've been able to pick up a lot. Coincidentally, one of my best friends growing up is a cop in Chicago, and one of my other best friends out in LA is a sheriff.

Brandt described Marie as \"an unpleasant bitch\", but also stated there was more to her than that. \"I think we're seeing more of it now that she would be there for her family.

Like Walter Jr., Mitte has cerebral palsy, although his is a milder form.<ref name=\"http://www.amctv.com/shows/breaking-bad/cast/walter-white-jr/rj-mitte\" /> Mitte stated he had to regress from his therapy to portray the character, staying up late into the night to slur his speech and learning to walk on crutches so his walking would not look fake.<ref name=\"AutoHY-23\" />\n* [[Bob Odenkirk]] as [[Saul Goodman]] (recurring season 2, main cast season 3\u20135)&nbsp;\u2013 a crooked [[strip mall]] lawyer who represents Walt and Jesse. Odenkirk drew inspiration for Goodman from film producer [[Robert Evans]]. <blockquote>I thought about Robert Evans because I've listened to ''[[The Kid Stays in the Picture]]'' on CD. He's constantly switching up his cadence and his delivery. He emphasizes interesting words. He has loads of attitude in almost every line that he says. So when I rehearse the scenes alone I do my impersonation of Robert Evans to find those moments and turns. Then I go out and I do Saul.<ref name=\"AutoHY-24\" /></blockquote>\n* [[Giancarlo Esposito]] as [[Gus Fring|Gustavo \"Gus\" Fring]] (recurring season 2, main cast season 3\u20134)&nbsp;\u2013 a Chilean high-level drug distributor who has a cover as an owner of the [[fast-food]] chain Los Pollos Hermanos. Esposito stated that for the third season, he incorporated his [[yoga]] training in his performance. <blockquote>Gus is the coolest cucumber that ever walked the Earth. I think about [[Edward James Olmos|Eddie Olmos]] way back in ''[[Miami Vice]]''. He was like dead&nbsp;\u2013 he was hardly breathing. I thought, how is this guy just standing in this fire and doing nothing? Gus has totally allowed me that level of flexibility and relaxation&nbsp;\u2013 not because he has ultimate power and he knows he can take someone's life. He's just confident.<ref name=\"AutoHY-25\" /></blockquote>\n* [[Jonathan Banks]] as [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] (guest star season 2, main cast season 3\u20135: part 1)&nbsp;\u2013 works for Gus as an all-purpose [[Cleaner (crime)|cleaner]] and [[hitman]], and also works for Saul as a private investigator. The character of Mike has been compared to [[Harvey Keitel]]'s Winston Wolf character in ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', which Banks says he is not trying to emulate: \"I immediately tried to put it out of my mind, quite honestly. His cleaner ain't my cleaner. But throughout this world, you would suspect there had been a great many cleaners, whether government-run or individual contractors.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-26\" />\n* [[Laura Fraser]] as [[Lydia Rodarte-Quayle]] (recurring season 5: part 1, main cast season 5: part 2)&nbsp;\u2013 a high-ranking employee of Madrigal Electromotive and a former associate of Gus Fring.

Jesse secures a [[recreational vehicle]] to cook in, while Walter devises a production route using unregulated chemicals, creating a highly pure product tinted blue. After a run-in with the Mexican drug cartel, Walter adopts the name \"Heisenberg\", with his \"blue sky\" meth his signature product. Hank and the DEA become aware of this new figure in the drug trade and begin their investigation.\n\n=== Season 2 (2009) ===\n{{Main|Breaking Bad (season 2)}}\nJesse's dealers become unsafe, and Walter hires a corrupt lawyer Saul to connect them to a high profile drug dealer Gus as a buyer for their latest batch. Jesse dates his apartment manager Jane, and she relapses on heroin; Jesse becomes unreliable. Walter refuses to pay him his half of the sale to Gus, but Jane blackmails Walter. Walter returns to Jesse to apologize, but allows an unconscious Jane to choke on her own vomit. With Jesse in rehab, Walter seems content until he witnesses a midair collision of two planes, a result of Jane's father, an air-traffic controller, becoming distraught over her death while on the job.\n\n=== Season 3 (2010) ===\n{{Main|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nOn April 2, 2009, AMC announced that ''Breaking Bad'' was renewed for a third, 13-episode season.<ref name=\"AutoHY-43\" /> It premiered on March 21, 2010, and concluded on June 13, 2010.

Walter demands Jesse to be his assistant rather than Gus' choice of Gale. Skyler learns of Walter's meth cooking and demands a divorce. Hank's investigation leads him to Jesse, but he finds no evidence and assaults Jesse, forcing him into a short leave. Hank is forewarned about an attack from two assassins, and kills them but he becomes paralyzed in the aftermath. Jesse's behavior becomes erratic, and Gus replaces him with Gale.

When their accomplice Todd kills a child witness during their theft of methylamine, Jesse and Mike sell their share to Declan. Walter produces meth for Declan, and Gus' former associate Lydia starts distribution in Europe, which is so successful that Walter earns {{USD|80 million}}, which he buries on the [[Tohajiilee Indian Reservation]]. Hank attempts to prove Walter is Heisenberg. Walter kills Mike when he demands his share of the money and hires Jack's gang to kill Mike's associates and Jesse. The gang turns on Walter, kills Hank, captures Jesse, and takes most of Walter's money. Walter uses the remainder to escape to New Hampshire.\n\nWalter intends to surrender, but changes course after Elliott and Gretchen minimize his involvement in starting Gray Matter. He leaves his money in a trust which Elliott and Gretchen would administer for his children. He confesses to Skyler that he dealt drugs because he liked it. At Jack's compound, Walter kills Jack and the rest of his gang with a remote controlled machine gun and frees the imprisoned Jesse, who kills Todd. Wounded in the aftermath, he asks Jesse to kill him, but Jesse refuses and departs. Walter reminisces in Jack's meth lab and eventually dies.\n\n== Themes and symbols ==\n\n=== Moral consequences ===\nIn an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', creator [[Vince Gilligan]] said the larger lesson of the series is that \"actions have consequences\".<ref name=\"Segal0706\" /> He elaborated on the show's philosophy:\n\n{{quote|text=If religion is a reaction of man, and nothing more, it seems to me that it represents a human desire for wrongdoers to be punished. I hate the idea of [[Idi Amin]] living in Saudi Arabia for the last 25 years of his life. That galls me to no end. I feel some sort of need for Biblical atonement, or justice, or something. I like to believe there is some comeuppance, that [[karma]] kicks in at some point, even if it takes years or decades to happen. My girlfriend says this great thing that's become my philosophy as well. 'I want to believe there's a heaven. But I can't not believe there's a hell.'}}\n\nIn a piece comparing the show to ''[[The Sopranos]]'', ''[[Mad Men]]'' and ''[[The Wire]]'', [[Chuck Klosterman]] said that ''Breaking Bad'' is \"built on the uncomfortable premise that there's an irrefutable difference between what's right and what's wrong, and it's the only one where the characters have real control over how they choose to live\". Klosterman added that the central question of ''Breaking Bad'' is: \"What makes a man 'bad'&nbsp;\u2013 his actions, his motives, or his conscious decision to be a bad person?\" Klosterman concluded that, in the world of ''Breaking Bad'', \"goodness and badness are simply complicated choices, no different than anything else\".<ref name=\"grantland\" />\n\n[[Ross Douthat]] of ''The New York Times'', in a response to Klosterman's piece, compared ''Breaking Bad'' and ''The Sopranos'', stating that both series are \"[[morality play]]s\" that are \"both interested in [[moral agency]]\". Douthat went on to say that [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] and [[Tony Soprano]] \"represent mirror-image takes on the problem of evil, damnation, and free will\". Walter is a man who \"deliberately abandons the light for the darkness\" while Tony is \"someone born and raised in darkness\" who turns down \"opportunity after opportunity to claw his way upward to the light\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-27\" />\n\n=== Devotion to family ===\nThe show explores most of the main characters' connections to their families in great detail. Walt justifies his decision to cook crystal meth and become a criminal because of his desire to provide for his family.<ref name=\"atlantic\" /> In the [[Breaking Bad (season 3)|third season]] he tries to exit the business because it has driven Skyler to leave him. Gus convinces him to stay, telling him it is a man's job to provide for his family, even if he is unloved.<ref name=\"AutoHY-28\" /> In the [[Felina (Breaking Bad)|final episode of the series]], however, Walt finally admits to Skyler that the main motivation for his endeavors in the meth business was his own interest, in spite of secretly securing the $9.72 million he had managed to salvage for her and the children. Jesse's loneliness in the early seasons of the show can be partly explained by his parents' decision to kick him out of their home due to his drug-related activities. This parental disconnect brings him closer to Jane, whose father berates her for her drug use. When Walt crosses paths with Jane's father, Walt refers to Jesse as his nephew and laments the fact that he cannot get through to him. Jane's father responds by telling him to keep trying, saying, \"Family. You can't give up on them, ever. What else is there?\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-29\" /> Jane's subsequent death, which Walt purposefully did not prevent, is a major factor in her father causing the airliner crash at the end of the second season.\n\nEven the show's more hardened characters maintain ties to family. In the [[Breaking Bad (season 2)|second season]], Tuco Salamanca spends time caring for his physically disabled uncle, Hector. When Tuco is killed by Hank, his cousins vow revenge. Their actions are further explained in a flashback, where Hector explains to the brothers that \"''La familia es todo''\" (\"Family is everything\"). Gustavo Fring's franchise ''Los Pollos Hermanos'' translates to \"The Chicken Brothers\". This refers to the fact that the company was co-founded by Gus and a man named Max, with whom he shared a close personal connection. When Max is killed by Hector Salamanca, Gus vows to destroy the Salamanca family.<ref name=\"atlantic\" /> In the first part of the [[Breaking Bad (season 5)|fifth season]], it is explained that Mike Ehrmantraut's intentions for being in this business were to provide for his granddaughter's future, and by his final episode he is conflicted when having to leave her in a park by herself once he has been warned that the police are onto him. During the second part of the fifth season, white supremacist Jack Welker says \"don't skimp on family\", and he lets Walt live after capturing him in the desert because of love for his nephew Todd Alquist, who has great respect for Walt. [[Lydia Rodarte-Quayle]] repeatedly demands that if Mike insists on killing her, that he leave her in her apartment so her daughter can find her, fearful she will think Lydia abandoned her. Much like Walt and Mike, Lydia seems to engage in the meth business in order to provide for her daughter, with actress Laura Fraser stating in an interview that Lydia's daughter is important to how \"Lydia justified what she did to herself\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/sep/30/breaking-bad-television |title=Breaking Bad's Lydia: 'Drinking camomile tea with milk is disgusting' |work=The Guardian |first=Stuart |last=Heritage |date=September 30, 2015 |accessdate=November 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Pink teddy bear ===\n[[File:Pink Teddy Bear from 'Breaking Bad'.jpg|thumb|The pink teddy bear as seen during the second season]]\nA [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] within the [[Breaking Bad (season 2)|second season]] is the image of a damaged teddy bear and its missing eye. The teddy bear first appears at the end of the [[music video]] \"Fallacies\" for Jesse's band \"Twa\u00fcghtHamm\u00ebr\", which was released as a [[webisode]] in February 2009 leading to the second season.<ref name=\"AutoHY-30\" /> The teddy bear can also be spotted on the mural on Jane's bedroom wall during the final episode of the second season, further connecting the crash to Jane. It is seen in flashforwards during four episodes, the titles of which, when put together in order, form the sentence \"[[Boeing 737|Seven Thirty-Seven]] down over [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|ABQ]]\".<ref name=\"nj\" /><ref name=\"lat\" /><ref name=\"time\" /> The flashforwards are shot in black and white, with the sole exception of the pink teddy bear, which is an homage to the film ''[[Schindler's List]]'', in which the color red is used to distinguish a little girl in a coat.<ref name=\"Gilligan Answers Fan Questions\" /> At the end of the season, Walter indirectly helps cause the midair collision of two airplanes;<ref name=\"AutoHY-31\" /><ref name=\"AutoHY-32\" /> the pink teddy bear is then revealed to have fallen out of one of the planes and into the Whites' swimming pool. Vince Gilligan called the plane accident an attempt to visualize \"all the terrible grief that Walt has wrought upon his loved ones\" and \"the judgment of God\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-33\" />\n\nIn the [[No M\u00e1s (Breaking Bad)|first episode of the third season]], Walt finds the teddy bear's missing eye in the pool skimmer. Television critic Myles McNutt has called it \"a symbol of the damage [Walter] feels responsible for\",<ref name=\"AutoHY-34\" /> and ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' commented that \"the pink teddy bear continues to accuse\".<ref name=\"avc\" /> Fans and critics have compared the appearance of the teddy bear's face to an image of [[Gus Fring]]'s face in the fourth-season finale.<ref name=\"AutoHY-35\" />\n\nThe teddy bear prop was auctioned off, among other memorabilia, on September 29, 2013, the air date of [[Felina (Breaking Bad)|the show finale]].<ref name=\"rollingstone\" /><ref name=\"people\" />\n\n=== Walt Whitman ===\nWalter White's name is reminiscent of the poet [[Walt Whitman]].<ref name=\"lat\"/> During the series, [[Gale Boetticher]] gives Walt a copy of Whitman's ''[[Leaves of Grass]]''.<ref name=\"AutoHY-37\" /> Prior to giving this gift, Boetticher recites \"When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-38\" /> In the episode \"[[Bullet Points (Breaking Bad)|Bullet Points]]\", Hank finds the initials W.W. written in Boetticher's notes, and jokes with Walt that they are his initials, although Walt indicates that they must refer to Whitman.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Hazard Pay]]\", Walt finds the copy of ''Leaves of Grass'' as he is packing up his bedroom, briefly smiles and leaves it out to read. This occurs at an especially high point in his life, where he feels that things are coming together and he is succeeding in all his ventures. A poem in the book, \"Song of Myself\", is based on many of these same feelings, furthering the connection between Walt's life and Whitman's poetry.<ref name=\"AutoHY-39\" /> The mid-season finale of season five, \"[[Gliding Over All]]\", is titled after poem 271 of ''Leaves of Grass''.<ref name=\"AutoHY-36\" /> In the episode, Hank finds ''Leaves of Grass'' in Walt's bathroom and opens it to the cover page, where he reads the hand-written inscription: \"To my <u>other</u> favorite W.W. It's an honour<!-- NOTICE TO EDITORS: THE NOTE SPELLS \"FAVORITE\" AND \"HONOUR\", SO WE SHOULD KEEP THAT SPELLING IN SPITE OF ITS INCONSISTENCY --> working with you. Fondly G.B.\" Upon reading this, Hank becomes visibly shocked, realizing the truth about Walter for the first time, which provides the opening premise for the second half of the final season.\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\n\n=== Critical reception ===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ {{color|green|Metacritic}}<ref name=MetacriticS1>{{cite web |title=Breaking Bad: Season 1 |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=April 3, 2019 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/breaking-bad/season-1}}</ref><ref name=MetacriticS2>{{cite web |title=Breaking Bad: Season 2 |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=April 3, 2019 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/breaking-bad/season-2}}</ref><ref name=MetacriticS3>{{cite web |title=Breaking Bad: Season 3 |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=April 3, 2019 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/breaking-bad/season-3}}</ref><ref name=MetacriticS4>{{cite web |title=Breaking Bad: Season 4 |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=April 3, 2019 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/breaking-bad/season-4}}</ref><ref name=MetacriticS5>{{cite web |title=Breaking Bad: Season 5 |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=April 3, 2019 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/breaking-bad/season-5}}</ref> and {{color|orange|Rotten Tomatoes}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/breaking_bad/s01 |title=Breaking Bad: Season 1 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/breaking_bad/s02 |title=Breaking Bad: Season 2 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/breaking_bad/s03 |title=Breaking Bad: Season 3 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/breaking_bad/s04 |title=Breaking Bad: Season 4 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/breaking_bad/s05 |title=Breaking Bad: Season 5 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref> scores per season\n|-\n|{{Graph:Chart |width=400 |height=200 |xAxisTitle=Season |yAxisTitle=Score |xType=string|type=line |showSymbols=true |colors=green,orange |x=1,2,3,4,5 |y1=73,84,89,96,99 |y2=83,100,100,100,100 |y1Title=Metacritic |y2Title=Rotten Tomatoes}}\n|}\n\n''Breaking Bad'' received widespread critical acclaim and has been praised by many critics as one of the greatest television shows of all time.<ref name=\"greatest\" /> On the [[review aggregator]] website [[Metacritic]], the first season scored 73 out of 100,<ref name=MetacriticS1/> the second 84 out of 100,<ref name=MetacriticS2/> the third 89 out of 100,<ref name=MetacriticS3/> the fourth 96 out of 100,<ref name=MetacriticS4/> and the fifth 99 out of 100.<ref name=MetacriticS5/> The [[American Film Institute]] listed ''Breaking Bad'' as one of the top ten television series of 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013.<ref name=\"AutoHY-49\" /><ref name=\"AutoHY-50\" /><ref name=\"AutoHY-51\" /><ref name=\"AutoHY-52\" /><ref name=\"AutoHY-53\" /> In 2013, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked it as the ninth greatest TV series of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/tv-guide-magazine-60-best-series-1074962/ |title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Best Series of All Time |work=TV Guide |first1=Bruce |last1=Fretts |first2=Matt |last2=Roush |date=December 23, 2013 |accessdate=October 17, 2015}}</ref> By its end, the series was among the most-watched [[cable television|cable shows]] on American television, with audience numbers doubling from the [[Breaking Bad (season 4)|fourth season]] to the [[Breaking Bad (season 5)|fifth]].<ref name=\"AutoHY-54\" />  A 2015 ''[[Hollywood Reporter]]'' survey of 2,800 actors, producers, directors, and other industry people named ''Breaking Bad'' as their #2 favorite show.<ref name=\"thr20150916\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/best-tv-shows-ever-top-819499/item/friends-hollywoods-100-favorite-tv-821361 |title=Hollywood's 100 Favorite TV Shows |date=2015-09-16 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=2019-07-17 |language=en}}</ref> In 2016, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked it third on its list of 100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/lists/100-greatest-tv-shows-of-all-time-w439520/breaking-bad-w439638 |title=100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time |work=Rolling Stone |first=Rob |last=Sheffield |date=September 21, 2016 |accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\nFor the first season, the series saw a generally positive reception. ''[[New York Post]]'' critic Linda Stasi praised the series, particularly the acting of Cranston and Paul, stating \"Cranston and Paul are so good, it's astounding. I'd say the two have created great chemistry, but I'm ashamed to say such a cheap thing.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-55\" /> Robert Bianco of ''[[USA Today]]'' also praised Cranston and Paul, exclaiming \"There is humor in the show, mostly in Walt's efforts to impose scholarly logic on the business and on his idiot apprentice, a role Paul plays very well. But even their scenes lean toward the suspenseful, as the duo learns that killing someone, even in self-defense, is ugly, messy work.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-56\" />\n\nThe second season saw critical acclaim. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' critic [[Ken Tucker]] stated \"''Bad'' is a superlatively fresh metaphor for a middle-age crisis: It took cancer and lawbreaking to jolt Walt out of his suburban stupor, to experience life again\u2014to take chances, risk danger, do things he didn't think himself capable of doing. None of this would work, of course, without Emmy winner Cranston's ferocious, funny selflessness as an actor. For all its bleakness and darkness, there's a glowing exhilaration about this series: It's a feel-good show about feeling really bad.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-57\" /> ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'''s Tim Goodman claimed \"The first three episodes of Season 2 that AMC sent out continue that level of achievement with no evident missteps. In fact, it looks as if Gilligan's bold vision for ''Breaking Bad'', now duly rewarded against all odds, has invigorated everyone involved in the project. You can sense its maturity and rising ambition in each episode.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-58\" /> Horror novelist [[Stephen King]] lauded the series, comparing it to the likes of ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' and ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]''.<ref name=\"AutoHY-59\" />\n[[File:Aaron Paul, Vince Gilligan and Bryan Cranston.jpg|right|thumb|From left to right: [[Josh Sapan]] (AMC president and CEO), [[Aaron Paul]] ([[Jesse Pinkman]]), [[Vince Gilligan]] (creator), [[Bryan Cranston]] ([[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]]) and Charlie Collier (President, general manager)]]\n\nThe third season also saw critical acclaim. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' proclaimed, \"It's a drama that has chosen the slow burn over the flashy explosion, and it's all the hotter for that choice.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-60\" /> ''[[Newsday]]'' stated ''Breaking Bad'' was still TV's best series and it stayed true to itself.<ref name=\"AutoHY-61\" /> Tim Goodman praised the writing, acting, and cinematography, pointing out the \"visual adventurousness\" of the series. Goodman went on to call the show's visuals \"a combination of staggering beauty&nbsp;\u2013 the directors make use of numerous wide-angle landscape portraits&nbsp;\u2013 and transfixing weirdness.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-62\" /> After the finale aired, ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' said that season three was \"one of television's finest dramatic accomplishments. And what makes it so exciting&nbsp;\u2013 what makes the recognition of the current golden age so pressing&nbsp;\u2013 is that the season has not been, as [another reviewer] put it in another context, 'television good.' The heart-in-the-throat quality of this season comes as much from the writers' exhilarating disregard for television conventions as from the events portrayed.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-63\" />\n\nSeason four won near-universal critical acclaim. ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' referred to the show as a \"taut exercise in withheld disaster\" and declared the show \"riveting\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-64\" /> The ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' labeled the series \"smart and thought provoking that elevates the artistic achievements of the medium\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-65\" /> Season four was listed by many critics as one of the best seasons of television in 2011.<ref name=\"AutoHY-66\" /> ''Time'' listed Walter White's \"I am the one who knocks\" line as one of the best television lines of 2011.<ref name=\"AutoHY-67\" /> ''The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' listed it as the best series of 2011 while noting that \"''Breaking Bad'' is that rare TV series that has never made a seriously damaging storytelling misstep.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-68\" /> ''The A.V. Club''{{'s}} review of the finale summed it up as a \"fantastically fitting end for a season that ran in slow motion, starting and continuing with so many crises begging for resolution week after week. Now the decks are cleared, but that doesn't mean anybody is home free. Nothing's ever easy on ''Breaking Bad''.\" The reviewer continued to exalt the season, and proclaimed, \"What a season of television&nbsp;\u2013 truly something none of us could ever have expected, or claimed we deserved.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-69\" />\n\nBoth halves of the fifth season received overwhelming critical acclaim. Following the end of the series, critic Nick Harley summarized his commendation of the show: \"Expertly written, virtuosic with its direction, and flawlessly performed, ''Breaking Bad'' is everything you could want in a drama. Critics will spend the next decade dissecting and arguing about what made it great, but the reasons are endless and already well documented.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-70\" /> During the final season, the show also received praise from [[George R. R. Martin]], author of the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, particularly the episode \"[[Ozymandias (Breaking Bad)|Ozymandias]]\"; Martin commented that \"Walter White is a bigger monster than anyone in [[Westeros]].\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-71\" /> In his review of the second half of season 5, Seth Amitin of [[IGN]] stated, \"This final batch of ''Breaking Bad'' is one of the best run of episodes TV has ever offered,\" and praised \"[[Ozymandias (Breaking Bad)|Ozymandias]]\" in particular, referring to it as \"maybe the best episode of TV [he's] ever seen\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-72\" /> Jonah Goldberg of ''[[National Review]]'' called it \"the best show currently on television, and perhaps even the best ever\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-73\" /> The veteran actor [[Order of the British Empire|Sir]] [[Anthony Hopkins]] wrote a letter of praise to Bryan Cranston, telling him that his \"performance as Walter White was the best acting I have seen&nbsp;\u2013 ever\".

Along with creator Vince Gilligan, fellow writers and producers [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]], [[Thomas Schnauz]], [[Gennifer Hutchison]], [[Moira Walley-Beckett]], [[Sam Catlin]] and [[George Mastras]] joined to discuss memories from the show's humble beginnings, character transformations that concluded in the final season as well as surprising developments along the way. For instance, the character of [[Jesse Pinkman]] was originally supposed to die halfway through season one in a tragic drug deal gone horribly wrong. The reasoning behind this decision was that Jesse served his purpose \"in a meat-and-potatoes, logistical sense. The character would give Walt his entr\u00e9e into the business\" before meeting his demise. However, this was eventually done away with as the story progressed beyond Gilligan's early scripts.<ref name=\"10th-anniversary\"/>\n\nThe writers also opened up on their collaborative process and how their form of [[storytelling]] evolved with the show. According to writer George Mastras,\n\n<blockquote>\"Screen time was precious, and infusing every moment with the emotion [was the point], not just forming the pieces of the puzzle to tell the story, which is hard enough. If you're going to take five seconds of screen time, you'd better damn well be sure that there's an emotion there. It may be very, very subtle, but trust the audiences to pick up on that, because audiences do.\"<ref name=\"10th-anniversary\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe development of certain characters posed challenges. [[Skyler White]] became unsympathetic to most viewers in earlier seasons as she was often presented as an obstacle to Walt's ultimate agenda. The writers struggled to change the dynamic and realized that \"the only way people were going to like Skyler was if she started going along with what Walt was doing.\" It was a tricky shift to alter on screen because they didn't want to betray her character so they justified the change by using her past job as a [[bookkeeper]] to segue into her helping Walt [[money launder]] his cash under the guise of a car wash. Breaking the individual episodes was another form of problem solving for the writers. They stressed the importance of not letting the \"master plan\" stop them from staying true to the world they created. There came a point where tracking the characters on a moment-by-moment basis proved to be more useful rather than general direction of the story. Peter Gould said they would always start with the last thought in a character's head. \"Where's Jesse's head at? That was always the prelude to the breakthrough moment, because when you said that, it's usually because we had gotten attached to some big plan or some big set-piece that we thought had to be there, but the characters didn't want to do what we wanted them to do.\"<ref name=\"10th-anniversary\"/>\n\n=== Rian Johnson's experience on the show ===\n\nDirector [[Rian Johnson]] worked on three episodes (\"[[Fly (Breaking Bad)|Fly]]\", \"[[Fifty-One]]\" and \"[[Ozymandias (Breaking Bad)|Ozymandias]]\") and in an interview with [[IGN]] shared his memories from behind the camera. He shed some light on the process including the fact that he sat through \"tone meetings\" with Vince Gilligan. The two of them talked about every dramatic beat in a script, the distinct visual look of the show and how the tonal shift of each scene had to feel natural while serving the main storyline of the particular episode. Johnson also revealed that he learned so much about working with actors because of his directing of [[Bryan Cranston]] and [[Aaron Paul]], describing the experience as a \"free masterclass.\"<ref name=\"ign-anniversary\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/20/breaking-bad-10th-anniversary-director-rian-johnson-looks-back-at-the-shows-legacy |title=Breaking Bad 10th Anniversary: Director Rian Johnson Looks Back at the Show's Legacy |publisher=IGN |first=Laura |last=Prudom |date=January 20, 2018 |accessdate=March 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhen asked about the show's lasting legacy, Johnson offered up his thoughts,\n<blockquote>\"I think the seriousness and depth with which it took its characters is the thing that really makes it stand apart for me. And that's where the power of it comes from. Obviously, starting with [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]], there's just very few stories that are told on that scale, that have a character who is that deeply considered at the center of it. And I've heard people describe it as [[Shakespearean]], and I know that word gets tossed around a lot, but I think in this case it really does apply. And that speaks, not so much to the fact that he goes to a dark place, but the fact that his entire journey is so deeply resonant, because it's so deeply considered.\"<ref name=\"ign-anniversary\"/></blockquote>\n\n== Spin-offs and adaptations ==\n=== ''Met\u00e1stasis'' ===\nOn March 13, 2013, after several days of speculation fueled by [[Univision]],<ref name=\"remake\" /> [[Sony]] confirmed that it would be making a Spanish-language remake of ''Breaking Bad'' titled ''[[Met\u00e1stasis]]'' starring [[Diego Trujillo]] as Walter Blanco (Walter White) and Roberto Urbina as Jos\u00e9 Miguel Rosas (Jesse Pinkman), alongside Sandra Reyes and [[Juli\u00e1n Arango]] in unnamed roles.<ref name=\"remakeconfirm\" /> On October 2, 2013, the cast list was revealed to include Reyes as Cielo Blanco (Skyler White) and Arango as Henry Navarro (Hank Schrader), and that the show would be set in Colombia.<ref name=\"metacast\" /> The equivalent of [[Saul Goodman]] is named Sa\u00fal Bueno.<ref name=\"ns\" />\n\n=== ''Better Call Saul'' ===\n{{main|Better Call Saul}}\nIn April 2013, it was revealed that AMC and Sony were interested in a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series that would focus on Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), with Gilligan and series writer [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] developing the project.<ref name=\"AutoHY-79\" /> In September 2013, AMC and Sony Pictures Television officially ordered ''Better Call Saul'', set as a prequel to ''Breaking Bad''.<ref name=\"AutoHY-80\" /> The series focuses on Saul's life 6 years before he became Walter's lawyer,<ref name=\"AutoHY-81\" /> and premiered on February 8, 2015.<ref name=\"AutoHY-82\" /> ''Better Call Saul'' recently finished airing its fifth season, with a sixth and final season to premiere in 2021.\n\n=== ''Talking Bad'' ===\nFrom August 11, 2013, to September 29, 2013, eight episodes of the live talk show, ''[[Talking Bad]]'', aired on AMC, following ''Breaking Bad''.

Initially making only small batches of meth with his former student [[Jesse Pinkman]] in a [[rolling meth lab]], Walter and Jesse eventually expand to make larger batches of a special blue meth that is incredibly pure and creates high demand. Walter takes on the name \"[[Heisenberg]]\" to mask his identity. Because of his drug-related activities, Walter eventually finds himself at odds with his family, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) through his brother-in-law [[Hank Schrader]], the local gangs, the Mexican drug cartels and their regional distributors, putting his life at risk.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Conception ===\n''Breaking Bad'' was created by [[Vince Gilligan]], who spent several years writing the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] series ''[[The X-Files]]''. Gilligan wanted to create a series in which the [[protagonist]] became the [[antagonist]]. \"Television is historically good at keeping its characters in a self-imposed stasis so that shows can go on for years or even decades,\" he said. \"When I realized this, the logical next step was to think, how can I do a show in which the fundamental drive is toward change?\"<ref name=\"grantland\" /> He added that his goal with Walter White was to turn him from [[Goodbye, Mr. Chips|Mr. Chips]] into [[Tony Montana|Scarface]].<ref name=\"THR\" /><ref name=\"Bowles0713\" /><ref name=\"Ginsberg0716\" /> Gilligan believed the concept of showing the full drastic transformation of a character across the run of a television show was a risky concept and would be difficult to pitch without other powerful factors to support it, such as strong cinematography and acting.<ref name=\"esquire history\"/>\n\nThe show title is a [[Southern United States|Southern]] colloquialism meaning, among other things, \"raising hell\", and was chosen by Gilligan to describe Walter's transformation.<ref name=\"AutoHY-2\" /> According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' entertainment editor Lily Rothman, the term has a broader meaning and is an old phrase which \"connotes more violence than 'raising hell' does&nbsp;... [T]he words possess a wide variety of nuances: to 'break bad' can mean to 'go wild', to 'defy authority', and break the law, to be verbally 'combative, belligerent, or threatening' or, followed by the preposition 'on', 'to dominate or humiliate'.\"<ref name=\"Rothman\" />\n\nThe concept emerged as Gilligan talked with his fellow ''X-Files'' writer [[Thomas Schnauz]] regarding their current unemployment and joked that the solution was for them to put a \"[[Rolling meth lab|meth lab in the back of an RV]] and [drive] around the country cooking meth and making money\".<ref name=\"tease\" />\n\nAfter writing the concept for the show and pilot, Gilligan pitched it to [[Sony Pictures Television]], who became very interested in supporting it. Sony arranged for meetings with the various cable networks. [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] passed on this, as they had already started broadcasting ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]'', a show with similarities to the premise of ''Breaking Bad''.<ref name=\"thr history\"/> While his producers convinced him that the show was different enough to still be successful, Gilligan later stated that he would not have gone forward with the idea had he known about ''Weeds'' earlier.<ref name=\"huffington-weeds\" /> Other networks like [[HBO]] and [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]] also passed on the idea, but eventually [[FX (TV Channel)|FX]] took interest and began initial discussions on producing the pilot.<ref name=\"thr history\">{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/breaking-bad-vince-gilligan-bryan-cranston-347082 |title=Bleak, Brutal, Brilliant 'Breaking Bad': Inside the Smash Hit That Almost Never Got Made |first1=Lacey |last1=Rose |first2=Stacey Wilson |last2=Hunt |date=July 11, 2012 |accessdate=July 1, 2019 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref> At the same time, FX had also started development of ''[[Dirt (TV series)|Dirt]]'', a female-centric crime-based drama series, and with three existing male-centric shows already on the network, FX passed up ''Breaking Bad'' for ''Dirt''.<ref name=\"thr history\"/>\n\nOne of Gilligan's agents spoke to Jeremy Elice, the director of original programming for [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] who was looking for more original shows to add alongside their upcoming ''[[Mad Men]]''. Elice was intrigued, and soon a meeting was set up between Gilligan, Elice, and two programming executives. Gilligan was not optimistic about this meeting, fearing they would just put him off, but instead all three showed great interest, and the meeting ended up establishing how AMC would acquire the rights from FX and set the pilot into production. It took about a year following this meeting before Sony had set up the rights with AMC and production could start.<ref name=\"thr history\"/>\n\n=== Development history ===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| total_width = 400\n| perrow    = 2\n| footer = ''Breaking Bad'' was filmed at various locations across Albuquerque.

Sony started to shop the show around, having gained quick interest from the FX network for two more seasons, upon which AMC changed its mind and allowed the show to continue.<ref name=\"thr 20190918\"/> At the same time, [[Netflix]] was starting to aggressively shop for content to add to its service, and arranged a deal with Sony for ''Breaking Bad'' to be available after the airing of the fourth season. However, knowing that AMC had placed ''Breaking Bad'' on a potential cancellation route, Sony pushed to have the show added to the service in time for the fourth season. Because of this, ''Breaking Bad''{{'}}s viewership grew greatly as viewers binged the series on Netflix, helping to assure that a fifth season could be made. The fifth-season premiere had more than double the viewership compared to the fourth season premiere, attributed to the Netflix availability.<ref name=\"thr 20190918\"/> Gilligan thanked Netflix at the Emmy Awards in September 2013 after the series' conclusion for the popularity of the series, saying that Netflix \"kept us on the air\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-10\" />\n\nAs the series progressed, Gilligan and the writing staff of ''Breaking Bad'' made Walter increasingly unsympathetic.<ref name=\"THR\" /> Gilligan said during the run of the series, \"He's going from being a protagonist to an antagonist. We want to make people question who they're pulling for, and why.\"<ref name=\"Bowles0713\" /> Cranston said by the [[Breaking Bad (season 4)|fourth season]], \"I think Walt's figured out it's better to be a pursuer than the pursued. He's well on his way to badass.\"<ref name=\"Ginsberg0716\" />\n\nIn July 2011, Vince Gilligan indicated that he intended to conclude ''Breaking Bad'' at the end of its fifth season.<ref name=\"AutoHY-8\" /> In early August 2011, negotiations began over a deal regarding the fifth and possible final season between the network [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] and [[Sony Pictures Television]], the production company of the series. AMC proposed a shortened fifth season (six to eight episodes, instead of 13) to cut costs, but the producers declined. Sony then approached other cable networks about possibly picking up the show if a deal could not be made.<ref name=\"AutoHY-9\" /> On August 14, 2011, AMC renewed the series for a fifth and final season consisting of 16 episodes.<ref name=\"final season\" />\n\nBefore the series finale, Gilligan said that it was difficult to write for Walter White because the character was so dark and morally questionable: \"I'm going to miss the show when it's over, but on some level, it'll be a relief to not have Walt in my head anymore.\"<ref name=\"Segal0706\" /> Gilligan later said the idea for Walter's character intrigued him so much that he \"didn't really give much thought on how well it would sell\", stating that he would have given up on the premise since it was \"such an odd, dark story\" that could have difficulties being pitched to studios.<ref name=tease /> Ultimately, Gilligan chose to end ''Breaking Bad'' with Walter's death, occurring in-story two years after he had been first been diagnosed with cancer and given two years to live. Gilligan said by the end of the series, \"it feels as if we should adhere to our promise that we explicitly made to our audience\" from the first episode.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/video-vince-gilligan-breaking-bads-639466 |title=Vince Gilligan on 'Breaking Bad's' 'The Searchers' Parallels: 'We Stole From the Best' |first=Sophie |last=Schillaci |date=September 30, 2013 |accessdate=March 7, 2020 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\n{{Quote box |width=30em|align=right|quote=\"You're going to see that underlying humanity, even when he's making the most devious, terrible decisions, and you need someone who has that humanity&nbsp;\u2013 deep down, bedrock humanity&nbsp;\u2013 so you say, watching this show, 'All right, I'll go for this ride.

Cranston played an anti-Semite with a terminal illness who took series co-protagonist [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) hostage. Gilligan said the character had to be simultaneously loathsome and sympathetic, and that \"Bryan alone was the only actor who could do that, who could pull off that trick. And it is a trick. I have no idea how he does it.\"<ref name=\"Segal0706\" /><ref name=\"Sepinwall0306\" /> AMC officials, who were initially reluctant with the casting choice, having known Cranston only as the over-the-top character [[Hal (Malcolm in the Middle)|Hal]] on the comedy series ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'', approached actors [[John Cusack]] and [[Matthew Broderick]] about the role.<ref name=\"AutoHY-11\" /> When both actors declined, the executives were persuaded to cast Cranston after seeing his ''X-Files'' episode.<ref name=\"Rosenblum0313\" />\n\nCranston contributed significantly to the formation and development of the Walter White persona. When Gilligan left much of Walter's past unexplained during the development of the series, the actor wrote his own [[backstory]] for the character.<ref name=\"Segal0706\" /> At the start of the show, Cranston gained 10 pounds to reflect the character's personal decline, and had the natural red highlights of his hair dyed brown. He collaborated with costume designer Kathleen Detoro on a wardrobe of mostly neutral green and brown colors to make the character bland and unremarkable, and worked with makeup artist Frieda Valenzuela to create a mustache he described as \"impotent\" and like a \"dead caterpillar\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-12\" /> Cranston repeatedly identified elements in certain scripts where he disagreed with how the character was handled,<ref name=\"AutoHY-13\" /> and went so far as to call Gilligan directly when he could not work out disagreements with the episode's screenwriters. Cranston has said he was inspired partially by his elderly father for how Walter carries himself physically, which he described as \"a little hunched over, never erect, [as if] the weight of the world is on this man's shoulders.\" In contrast to his character, Cranston has been described as extremely playful on set, with Aaron Paul describing him as \"a kid trapped in a man's body\".<ref name=\"Segal0706\" />\n\n[[Aaron Paul]]'s casting was also initially questioned by production, as Paul looked too old and too much like a \"pretty boy\" to be associated with meth cooking. However, Gilligan reconsidered Paul's skills after seeing his audition and recalling he had also had guest starred on ''The X-Files'' episode \"[[Lord of the Flies (The X-Files)|Lord of the Flies]]\".<ref name=\"thr history\"/> Gilligan originally intended for Pinkman to be killed at the end of ''Breaking Bad''{{'}}s [[Breaking Bad (season 1)|first season]] in a botched drug deal as a plot device to plague Walter White with guilt. However, Gilligan said by the second episode of the season, he was so impressed with Paul's performance that \"it became pretty clear early on that would be a huge, colossal mistake, to kill off Jesse\".<ref name=\"Paley Centre\" /> Similarly, [[Dean Norris]] had shown his ability to be a law enforcement official in ''The X-Files'' episode \"[[F. Emasculata]]\", and was brought on to be Hank Schrader, Walter's brother-in-law and DEA agent.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/how-x-files-gave-birth-784003 |title=How 'X-Files' Gave Birth to 'Breaking Bad' |first=Aaron |last=Couch |date=March 24, 2015 |accessdate=July 17, 2019 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Scientific accuracy ===\n[[Donna Nelson]], a professor of [[organic chemistry]] at the [[University of Oklahoma]], checked scripts and provided dialogue. She also drew [[chemical structure]]s and wrote [[chemical equation]]s which were used as props. According to creator Vince Gilligan,\n\n<blockquote>Dr. Donna Nelson from the University of Oklahoma approached us several seasons back and said, \"I really like this show, and if you ever need help with the chemistry, I'd love to lend a hand.\" She's been a wonderful advisor. We get help wherever we need it, whether it's chemistry, [[electrical engineering]], or [[physics]]. We try to get everything correct. There's no full-time [advisor] on set, but we run certain scenes by these experts first.<ref name=\"AutoHY-14\" /></blockquote>\n\n\"Because Walter White was talking to his students, I was able to dumb down certain moments of description and dialogue in the early episodes which held me until we had some help from some honest-to-God chemists,\" says Gilligan. According to Gilligan, Nelson \"vets our scripts to make sure our chemistry dialogue is accurate and up to date. We also have a chemist with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] based out of Dallas who has just been hugely helpful to us.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-15\" /> Nelson spoke of Gilligan's interest in having the science right, saying that Gilligan \"said it made a difference to him.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-16\" />\n\nSeveral episodes of ''[[Mythbusters]]'' featured attempts to validate or disprove scenes from ''Breaking Bad'', often with Gilligan guest-starring in the episode to participate. In 2013, two scenes from the first season of ''Breaking Bad'' were put under scrutiny in a [[MythBusters (2013 season)#Episode 206&nbsp;\u2013 \"Breaking Bad Special\"|''Mythbusters Breaking Bad'' special]].

The new method Walt chooses is a [[reductive amination]] reaction, relying on phenyl-2-propanone and [[methylamine]]. On the show, the phenyl-2-propanone (otherwise known as [[phenylacetone]] or P2P) is produced from [[phenylacetic acid]] and [[acetic acid]] using a [[tube furnace]] and [[thorium dioxide]] (ThO<sub>2</sub>) as a [[Catalysis|catalyst]], as mentioned in episodes \"A No Rough-Stuff-Type Deal\" and \"M\u00e1s\". P2P and methylamine form an [[imine]] intermediate; [[Redox|reduction]] of this P2P-methylamine imine intermediate is performed using [[Aluminium amalgam|mercury aluminum amalgam]], as shown in several episodes including \"Hazard Pay\".<ref name=\"vice\" />\n\nOne of the important plot points in the series is that the crystal meth Walter \"cooks\" has very long crystals, is very pure, and (despite its purity) has a strong cyan blue color. Truly ultra-pure crystal meth would tend to be clear or white.<ref name=\"chemistry\"/>\n\nIn their article \"Die Chemie bei Breaking Bad\" on ''Chemie in unserer Zeit'' (translated into English on ''ChemistryViews'' as \"The Chemistry of ''Breaking Bad''\"), Tunga Salthammer and Falk Harnish discuss the plausibility of the chemistry portrayed in certain scenes. According to the two, chemistry is clearly depicted as a manufacturing science without much explanation of analytical methods being provided. On the other hand, serious scientific subjects are mixed into the dialogue in order to show a world where chemistry plays a key role.<ref name=\"chemistry\" />\n\n=== Technical aspects ===\n[[Michael Slovis]] was the cinematographer of ''Breaking Bad'' beginning with the second season and he received critical acclaim for his work throughout the series. Critics appreciated the bold visual style adopted by the TV series.

As his shady business progresses, Walter gains a notorious reputation under the name of \"Heisenberg\". Cranston stated that, though he enjoyed doing comedy, he decided he <blockquote>... should really focus on doing something else. But I think any good drama worth its weight always has a sprinkling of comedy in it, because you can ease the tension to an audience when it's necessary, and then build it back up again. Walt White has no clue he's occasionally funny, but as an actor, I recognize when there are comedic moments and opportunities.<ref name=\"AutoHY-18\" /></blockquote>\n* [[Anna Gunn]] as [[Skyler White]]&nbsp;\u2013 Walter's wife who was pregnant with their second child before his diagnosis and who becomes increasingly suspicious of her husband after he begins behaving in unfamiliar ways.

Norris, who has played several policemen before in film and television, stated: <blockquote>Having played so many cops, I've talked with a lot of technical advisers, so I've been able to pick up a lot.

He's constantly switching up his cadence and his delivery. He emphasizes interesting words. He has loads of attitude in almost every line that he says.

Jesse secures a [[recreational vehicle]] to cook in, while Walter devises a production route using unregulated chemicals, creating a highly pure product tinted blue. After a run-in with the Mexican drug cartel, Walter adopts the name \"Heisenberg\", with his \"blue sky\" meth his signature product. Hank and the DEA become aware of this new figure in the drug trade and begin their investigation.\n\n=== Season 2 (2009) ===\n{{Main|Breaking Bad (season 2)}}\nJesse's dealers become unsafe, and Walter hires a corrupt lawyer Saul to connect them to a high profile drug dealer Gus as a buyer for their latest batch. Jesse dates his apartment manager Jane, and she relapses on heroin; Jesse becomes unreliable. Walter refuses to pay him his half of the sale to Gus, but Jane blackmails Walter. Walter returns to Jesse to apologize, but allows an unconscious Jane to choke on her own vomit. With Jesse in rehab, Walter seems content until he witnesses a midair collision of two planes, a result of Jane's father, an air-traffic controller, becoming distraught over her death while on the job.\n\n=== Season 3 (2010) ===\n{{Main|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nOn April 2, 2009, AMC announced that ''Breaking Bad'' was renewed for a third, 13-episode season.<ref name=\"AutoHY-43\" /> It premiered on March 21, 2010, and concluded on June 13, 2010. The complete third season was released on Region 1 DVD and Region A Blu-ray on June 7, 2011.<ref name=\"s3 release\" />\n\nGus offers Walter a job cooking meth at a hidden lab. Walter demands Jesse to be his assistant rather than Gus' choice of Gale. Skyler learns of Walter's meth cooking and demands a divorce. Hank's investigation leads him to Jesse, but he finds no evidence and assaults Jesse, forcing him into a short leave. Hank is forewarned about an attack from two assassins, and kills them but he becomes paralyzed in the aftermath. Jesse's behavior becomes erratic, and Gus replaces him with Gale. Later, Walter fears Gus will kill him and Jesse once Gale learns enough about their methods, and instructs Jesse to kill Gale.\n\n=== Season 4 (2011) ===\n{{Main|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nOn June 14, 2010, AMC announced ''Breaking Bad'' was renewed for a fourth, 13-episode season.<ref name=\"season 4\" /> Production began in January 2011,<ref name=\"AutoHY-44\" /> the season premiered on July 17, 2011, and concluded on October 9, 2011.<ref name=\"AutoHY-45\" /> Originally, mini episodes of four minutes in length were to be produced before the premiere of the fourth season,<ref name=\"AutoHY-46\" /> but these did not come to fruition.<ref name=\"AutoHY-47\" />\n\nGus tightens security at the lab after Gale's death. Gus and Mike work to drive a wedge between Walter and Jesse, seeking to coerce Jesse to be their solitary cook by capturing Walter while at the same time eliminating the Mexican cartel. Skyler accepts Walter's meth cooking, and works with Saul to launder his earnings. Hank, while recovering, tracks Gale's death to Gus and the drug trade. Gus releases Walter and plans to kill Hank. Walter tricks Jesse into turning against Gus, and convinces Hector to detonate a pipe bomb in the same room as Gus, killing them both.\n\n=== Season 5 (2012\u201313) ===\n{{Main|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\n\nOn August 14, 2011, AMC announced that ''Breaking Bad'' was renewed for a fifth and final season consisting of 16 episodes.<ref name=\"final season\" /> Season five is split into two parts, each consisting of 8 episodes.

When their accomplice Todd kills a child witness during their theft of methylamine, Jesse and Mike sell their share to Declan. Walter produces meth for Declan, and Gus' former associate Lydia starts distribution in Europe, which is so successful that Walter earns {{USD|80 million}}, which he buries on the [[Tohajiilee Indian Reservation]]. Hank attempts to prove Walter is Heisenberg. Walter kills Mike when he demands his share of the money and hires Jack's gang to kill Mike's associates and Jesse. The gang turns on Walter, kills Hank, captures Jesse, and takes most of Walter's money. Walter uses the remainder to escape to New Hampshire.\n\nWalter intends to surrender, but changes course after Elliott and Gretchen minimize his involvement in starting Gray Matter. He leaves his money in a trust which Elliott and Gretchen would administer for his children. He confesses to Skyler that he dealt drugs because he liked it. At Jack's compound, Walter kills Jack and the rest of his gang with a remote controlled machine gun and frees the imprisoned Jesse, who kills Todd. Wounded in the aftermath, he asks Jesse to kill him, but Jesse refuses and departs. Walter reminisces in Jack's meth lab and eventually dies.\n\n== Themes and symbols ==\n\n=== Moral consequences ===\nIn an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', creator [[Vince Gilligan]] said the larger lesson of the series is that \"actions have consequences\".<ref name=\"Segal0706\" /> He elaborated on the show's philosophy:\n\n{{quote|text=If religion is a reaction of man, and nothing more, it seems to me that it represents a human desire for wrongdoers to be punished. I hate the idea of [[Idi Amin]] living in Saudi Arabia for the last 25 years of his life. That galls me to no end. I feel some sort of need for Biblical atonement, or justice, or something. I like to believe there is some comeuppance, that [[karma]] kicks in at some point, even if it takes years or decades to happen. My girlfriend says this great thing that's become my philosophy as well. 'I want to believe there's a heaven. But I can't not believe there's a hell.'}}\n\nIn a piece comparing the show to ''[[The Sopranos]]'', ''[[Mad Men]]'' and ''[[The Wire]]'', [[Chuck Klosterman]] said that ''Breaking Bad'' is \"built on the uncomfortable premise that there's an irrefutable difference between what's right and what's wrong, and it's the only one where the characters have real control over how they choose to live\". Klosterman added that the central question of ''Breaking Bad'' is: \"What makes a man 'bad'&nbsp;\u2013 his actions, his motives, or his conscious decision to be a bad person?\" Klosterman concluded that, in the world of ''Breaking Bad'', \"goodness and badness are simply complicated choices, no different than anything else\".<ref name=\"grantland\" />\n\n[[Ross Douthat]] of ''The New York Times'', in a response to Klosterman's piece, compared ''Breaking Bad'' and ''The Sopranos'', stating that both series are \"[[morality play]]s\" that are \"both interested in [[moral agency]]\". Douthat went on to say that [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] and [[Tony Soprano]] \"represent mirror-image takes on the problem of evil, damnation, and free will\". Walter is a man who \"deliberately abandons the light for the darkness\" while Tony is \"someone born and raised in darkness\" who turns down \"opportunity after opportunity to claw his way upward to the light\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-27\" />\n\n=== Devotion to family ===\nThe show explores most of the main characters' connections to their families in great detail. Walt justifies his decision to cook crystal meth and become a criminal because of his desire to provide for his family.<ref name=\"atlantic\" /> In the [[Breaking Bad (season 3)|third season]] he tries to exit the business because it has driven Skyler to leave him. Gus convinces him to stay, telling him it is a man's job to provide for his family, even if he is unloved.<ref name=\"AutoHY-28\" /> In the [[Felina (Breaking Bad)|final episode of the series]], however, Walt finally admits to Skyler that the main motivation for his endeavors in the meth business was his own interest, in spite of secretly securing the $9.72 million he had managed to salvage for her and the children. Jesse's loneliness in the early seasons of the show can be partly explained by his parents' decision to kick him out of their home due to his drug-related activities. This parental disconnect brings him closer to Jane, whose father berates her for her drug use. When Walt crosses paths with Jane's father, Walt refers to Jesse as his nephew and laments the fact that he cannot get through to him. Jane's father responds by telling him to keep trying, saying, \"Family. You can't give up on them, ever. What else is there?\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-29\" /> Jane's subsequent death, which Walt purposefully did not prevent, is a major factor in her father causing the airliner crash at the end of the second season.\n\nEven the show's more hardened characters maintain ties to family. In the [[Breaking Bad (season 2)|second season]], Tuco Salamanca spends time caring for his physically disabled uncle, Hector. When Tuco is killed by Hank, his cousins vow revenge. Their actions are further explained in a flashback, where Hector explains to the brothers that \"''La familia es todo''\" (\"Family is everything\"). Gustavo Fring's franchise ''Los Pollos Hermanos'' translates to \"The Chicken Brothers\". This refers to the fact that the company was co-founded by Gus and a man named Max, with whom he shared a close personal connection. When Max is killed by Hector Salamanca, Gus vows to destroy the Salamanca family.<ref name=\"atlantic\" /> In the first part of the [[Breaking Bad (season 5)|fifth season]], it is explained that Mike Ehrmantraut's intentions for being in this business were to provide for his granddaughter's future, and by his final episode he is conflicted when having to leave her in a park by herself once he has been warned that the police are onto him. During the second part of the fifth season, white supremacist Jack Welker says \"don't skimp on family\", and he lets Walt live after capturing him in the desert because of love for his nephew Todd Alquist, who has great respect for Walt. [[Lydia Rodarte-Quayle]] repeatedly demands that if Mike insists on killing her, that he leave her in her apartment so her daughter can find her, fearful she will think Lydia abandoned her. Much like Walt and Mike, Lydia seems to engage in the meth business in order to provide for her daughter, with actress Laura Fraser stating in an interview that Lydia's daughter is important to how \"Lydia justified what she did to herself\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/sep/30/breaking-bad-television |title=Breaking Bad's Lydia: 'Drinking camomile tea with milk is disgusting' |work=The Guardian |first=Stuart |last=Heritage |date=September 30, 2015 |accessdate=November 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Pink teddy bear ===\n[[File:Pink Teddy Bear from 'Breaking Bad'.jpg|thumb|The pink teddy bear as seen during the second season]]\nA [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] within the [[Breaking Bad (season 2)|second season]] is the image of a damaged teddy bear and its missing eye. The teddy bear first appears at the end of the [[music video]] \"Fallacies\" for Jesse's band \"Twa\u00fcghtHamm\u00ebr\", which was released as a [[webisode]] in February 2009 leading to the second season.<ref name=\"AutoHY-30\" /> The teddy bear can also be spotted on the mural on Jane's bedroom wall during the final episode of the second season, further connecting the crash to Jane. It is seen in flashforwards during four episodes, the titles of which, when put together in order, form the sentence \"[[Boeing 737|Seven Thirty-Seven]] down over [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|ABQ]]\".<ref name=\"nj\" /><ref name=\"lat\" /><ref name=\"time\" /> The flashforwards are shot in black and white, with the sole exception of the pink teddy bear, which is an homage to the film ''[[Schindler's List]]'', in which the color red is used to distinguish a little girl in a coat.<ref name=\"Gilligan Answers Fan Questions\" /> At the end of the season, Walter indirectly helps cause the midair collision of two airplanes;<ref name=\"AutoHY-31\" /><ref name=\"AutoHY-32\" /> the pink teddy bear is then revealed to have fallen out of one of the planes and into the Whites' swimming pool. Vince Gilligan called the plane accident an attempt to visualize \"all the terrible grief that Walt has wrought upon his loved ones\" and \"the judgment of God\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-33\" />\n\nIn the [[No M\u00e1s (Breaking Bad)|first episode of the third season]], Walt finds the teddy bear's missing eye in the pool skimmer. Television critic Myles McNutt has called it \"a symbol of the damage [Walter] feels responsible for\",<ref name=\"AutoHY-34\" /> and ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' commented that \"the pink teddy bear continues to accuse\".<ref name=\"avc\" /> Fans and critics have compared the appearance of the teddy bear's face to an image of [[Gus Fring]]'s face in the fourth-season finale.<ref name=\"AutoHY-35\" />\n\nThe teddy bear prop was auctioned off, among other memorabilia, on September 29, 2013, the air date of [[Felina (Breaking Bad)|the show finale]].<ref name=\"rollingstone\" /><ref name=\"people\" />\n\n=== Walt Whitman ===\nWalter White's name is reminiscent of the poet [[Walt Whitman]].<ref name=\"lat\"/> During the series, [[Gale Boetticher]] gives Walt a copy of Whitman's ''[[Leaves of Grass]]''.<ref name=\"AutoHY-37\" /> Prior to giving this gift, Boetticher recites \"When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-38\" /> In the episode \"[[Bullet Points (Breaking Bad)|Bullet Points]]\", Hank finds the initials W.W. written in Boetticher's notes, and jokes with Walt that they are his initials, although Walt indicates that they must refer to Whitman.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Hazard Pay]]\", Walt finds the copy of ''Leaves of Grass'' as he is packing up his bedroom, briefly smiles and leaves it out to read. This occurs at an especially high point in his life, where he feels that things are coming together and he is succeeding in all his ventures. A poem in the book, \"Song of Myself\", is based on many of these same feelings, furthering the connection between Walt's life and Whitman's poetry.<ref name=\"AutoHY-39\" /> The mid-season finale of season five, \"[[Gliding Over All]]\", is titled after poem 271 of ''Leaves of Grass''.<ref name=\"AutoHY-36\" /> In the episode, Hank finds ''Leaves of Grass'' in Walt's bathroom and opens it to the cover page, where he reads the hand-written inscription: \"To my <u>other</u> favorite W.W. It's an honour<!-- NOTICE TO EDITORS: THE NOTE SPELLS \"FAVORITE\" AND \"HONOUR\", SO WE SHOULD KEEP THAT SPELLING IN SPITE OF ITS INCONSISTENCY --> working with you. Fondly G.B.\" Upon reading this, Hank becomes visibly shocked, realizing the truth about Walter for the first time, which provides the opening premise for the second half of the final season.\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\n\n=== Critical reception ===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ {{color|green|Metacritic}}<ref name=MetacriticS1>{{cite web |title=Breaking Bad: Season 1 |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=April 3, 2019 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/breaking-bad/season-1}}</ref><ref name=MetacriticS2>{{cite web |title=Breaking Bad: Season 2 |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=April 3, 2019 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/breaking-bad/season-2}}</ref><ref name=MetacriticS3>{{cite web |title=Breaking Bad: Season 3 |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=April 3, 2019 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/breaking-bad/season-3}}</ref><ref name=MetacriticS4>{{cite web |title=Breaking Bad: Season 4 |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=April 3, 2019 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/breaking-bad/season-4}}</ref><ref name=MetacriticS5>{{cite web |title=Breaking Bad: Season 5 |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=April 3, 2019 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/breaking-bad/season-5}}</ref> and {{color|orange|Rotten Tomatoes}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/breaking_bad/s01 |title=Breaking Bad: Season 1 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/breaking_bad/s02 |title=Breaking Bad: Season 2 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/breaking_bad/s03 |title=Breaking Bad: Season 3 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/breaking_bad/s04 |title=Breaking Bad: Season 4 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/breaking_bad/s05 |title=Breaking Bad: Season 5 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref> scores per season\n|-\n|{{Graph:Chart |width=400 |height=200 |xAxisTitle=Season |yAxisTitle=Score |xType=string|type=line |showSymbols=true |colors=green,orange |x=1,2,3,4,5 |y1=73,84,89,96,99 |y2=83,100,100,100,100 |y1Title=Metacritic |y2Title=Rotten Tomatoes}}\n|}\n\n''Breaking Bad'' received widespread critical acclaim and has been praised by many critics as one of the greatest television shows of all time.<ref name=\"greatest\" /> On the [[review aggregator]] website [[Metacritic]], the first season scored 73 out of 100,<ref name=MetacriticS1/> the second 84 out of 100,<ref name=MetacriticS2/> the third 89 out of 100,<ref name=MetacriticS3/> the fourth 96 out of 100,<ref name=MetacriticS4/> and the fifth 99 out of 100.<ref name=MetacriticS5/> The [[American Film Institute]] listed ''Breaking Bad'' as one of the top ten television series of 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013.<ref name=\"AutoHY-49\" /><ref name=\"AutoHY-50\" /><ref name=\"AutoHY-51\" /><ref name=\"AutoHY-52\" /><ref name=\"AutoHY-53\" /> In 2013, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked it as the ninth greatest TV series of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/tv-guide-magazine-60-best-series-1074962/ |title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Best Series of All Time |work=TV Guide |first1=Bruce |last1=Fretts |first2=Matt |last2=Roush |date=December 23, 2013 |accessdate=October 17, 2015}}</ref> By its end, the series was among the most-watched [[cable television|cable shows]] on American television, with audience numbers doubling from the [[Breaking Bad (season 4)|fourth season]] to the [[Breaking Bad (season 5)|fifth]].<ref name=\"AutoHY-54\" />  A 2015 ''[[Hollywood Reporter]]'' survey of 2,800 actors, producers, directors, and other industry people named ''Breaking Bad'' as their #2 favorite show.<ref name=\"thr20150916\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/best-tv-shows-ever-top-819499/item/friends-hollywoods-100-favorite-tv-821361 |title=Hollywood's 100 Favorite TV Shows |date=2015-09-16 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=2019-07-17 |language=en}}</ref> In 2016, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked it third on its list of 100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/lists/100-greatest-tv-shows-of-all-time-w439520/breaking-bad-w439638 |title=100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time |work=Rolling Stone |first=Rob |last=Sheffield |date=September 21, 2016 |accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\nFor the first season, the series saw a generally positive reception. ''[[New York Post]]'' critic Linda Stasi praised the series, particularly the acting of Cranston and Paul, stating \"Cranston and Paul are so good, it's astounding. I'd say the two have created great chemistry, but I'm ashamed to say such a cheap thing.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-55\" /> Robert Bianco of ''[[USA Today]]'' also praised Cranston and Paul, exclaiming \"There is humor in the show, mostly in Walt's efforts to impose scholarly logic on the business and on his idiot apprentice, a role Paul plays very well. But even their scenes lean toward the suspenseful, as the duo learns that killing someone, even in self-defense, is ugly, messy work.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-56\" />\n\nThe second season saw critical acclaim. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' critic [[Ken Tucker]] stated \"''Bad'' is a superlatively fresh metaphor for a middle-age crisis: It took cancer and lawbreaking to jolt Walt out of his suburban stupor, to experience life again\u2014to take chances, risk danger, do things he didn't think himself capable of doing. None of this would work, of course, without Emmy winner Cranston's ferocious, funny selflessness as an actor. For all its bleakness and darkness, there's a glowing exhilaration about this series: It's a feel-good show about feeling really bad.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-57\" /> ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'''s Tim Goodman claimed \"The first three episodes of Season 2 that AMC sent out continue that level of achievement with no evident missteps. In fact, it looks as if Gilligan's bold vision for ''Breaking Bad'', now duly rewarded against all odds, has invigorated everyone involved in the project. You can sense its maturity and rising ambition in each episode.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-58\" /> Horror novelist [[Stephen King]] lauded the series, comparing it to the likes of ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' and ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]''.<ref name=\"AutoHY-59\" />\n[[File:Aaron Paul, Vince Gilligan and Bryan Cranston.jpg|right|thumb|From left to right: [[Josh Sapan]] (AMC president and CEO), [[Aaron Paul]] ([[Jesse Pinkman]]), [[Vince Gilligan]] (creator), [[Bryan Cranston]] ([[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]]) and Charlie Collier (President, general manager)]]\n\nThe third season also saw critical acclaim. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' proclaimed, \"It's a drama that has chosen the slow burn over the flashy explosion, and it's all the hotter for that choice.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-60\" /> ''[[Newsday]]'' stated ''Breaking Bad'' was still TV's best series and it stayed true to itself.<ref name=\"AutoHY-61\" /> Tim Goodman praised the writing, acting, and cinematography, pointing out the \"visual adventurousness\" of the series. Goodman went on to call the show's visuals \"a combination of staggering beauty&nbsp;\u2013 the directors make use of numerous wide-angle landscape portraits&nbsp;\u2013 and transfixing weirdness.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-62\" /> After the finale aired, ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' said that season three was \"one of television's finest dramatic accomplishments. And what makes it so exciting&nbsp;\u2013 what makes the recognition of the current golden age so pressing&nbsp;\u2013 is that the season has not been, as [another reviewer] put it in another context, 'television good.' The heart-in-the-throat quality of this season comes as much from the writers' exhilarating disregard for television conventions as from the events portrayed.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-63\" />\n\nSeason four won near-universal critical acclaim. ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' referred to the show as a \"taut exercise in withheld disaster\" and declared the show \"riveting\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-64\" /> The ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' labeled the series \"smart and thought provoking that elevates the artistic achievements of the medium\".<ref name=\"AutoHY-65\" /> Season four was listed by many critics as one of the best seasons of television in 2011.<ref name=\"AutoHY-66\" /> ''Time'' listed Walter White's \"I am the one who knocks\" line as one of the best television lines of 2011.<ref name=\"AutoHY-67\" /> ''The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' listed it as the best series of 2011 while noting that \"''Breaking Bad'' is that rare TV series that has never made a seriously damaging storytelling misstep.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-68\" /> ''The A.V. Club''{{'s}} review of the finale summed it up as a \"fantastically fitting end for a season that ran in slow motion, starting and continuing with so many crises begging for resolution week after week. Now the decks are cleared, but that doesn't mean anybody is home free. Nothing's ever easy on ''Breaking Bad''.\" The reviewer continued to exalt the season, and proclaimed, \"What a season of television&nbsp;\u2013 truly something none of us could ever have expected, or claimed we deserved.\"<ref name=\"AutoHY-69\" />\n\nBoth halves of the fifth season received overwhelming critical acclaim. Following the end of the series, critic Nick Harley summarized his commendation of the show: \"Expertly written, virtuosic with its direction, and flawlessly performed, ''Breaking Bad'' is everything you could want in a drama.

Along with creator Vince Gilligan, fellow writers and producers [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]], [[Thomas Schnauz]], [[Gennifer Hutchison]], [[Moira Walley-Beckett]], [[Sam Catlin]] and [[George Mastras]] joined to discuss memories from the show's humble beginnings, character transformations that concluded in the final season as well as surprising developments along the way. For instance, the character of [[Jesse Pinkman]] was originally supposed to die halfway through season one in a tragic drug deal gone horribly wrong. The reasoning behind this decision was that Jesse served his purpose \"in a meat-and-potatoes, logistical sense. The character would give Walt his entr\u00e9e into the business\" before meeting his demise. However, this was eventually done away with as the story progressed beyond Gilligan's early scripts.<ref name=\"10th-anniversary\"/>\n\nThe writers also opened up on their collaborative process and how their form of [[storytelling]] evolved with the show. According to writer George Mastras,\n\n<blockquote>\"Screen time was precious, and infusing every moment with the emotion [was the point], not just forming the pieces of the puzzle to tell the story, which is hard enough. If you're going to take five seconds of screen time, you'd better damn well be sure that there's an emotion there. It may be very, very subtle, but trust the audiences to pick up on that, because audiences do.\"<ref name=\"10th-anniversary\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe development of certain characters posed challenges. [[Skyler White]] became unsympathetic to most viewers in earlier seasons as she was often presented as an obstacle to Walt's ultimate agenda. The writers struggled to change the dynamic and realized that \"the only way people were going to like Skyler was if she started going along with what Walt was doing.\" It was a tricky shift to alter on screen because they didn't want to betray her character so they justified the change by using her past job as a [[bookkeeper]] to segue into her helping Walt [[money launder]] his cash under the guise of a car wash. Breaking the individual episodes was another form of problem solving for the writers. They stressed the importance of not letting the \"master plan\" stop them from staying true to the world they created. There came a point where tracking the characters on a moment-by-moment basis proved to be more useful rather than general direction of the story. Peter Gould said they would always start with the last thought in a character's head. \"Where's Jesse's head at? That was always the prelude to the breakthrough moment, because when you said that, it's usually because we had gotten attached to some big plan or some big set-piece that we thought had to be there, but the characters didn't want to do what we wanted them to do.\"<ref name=\"10th-anniversary\"/>\n\n=== Rian Johnson's experience on the show ===\n\nDirector [[Rian Johnson]] worked on three episodes (\"[[Fly (Breaking Bad)|Fly]]\", \"[[Fifty-One]]\" and \"[[Ozymandias (Breaking Bad)|Ozymandias]]\") and in an interview with [[IGN]] shared his memories from behind the camera. He shed some light on the process including the fact that he sat through \"tone meetings\" with Vince Gilligan. The two of them talked about every dramatic beat in a script, the distinct visual look of the show and how the tonal shift of each scene had to feel natural while serving the main storyline of the particular episode. Johnson also revealed that he learned so much about working with actors because of his directing of [[Bryan Cranston]] and [[Aaron Paul]], describing the experience as a \"free masterclass.\"<ref name=\"ign-anniversary\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/20/breaking-bad-10th-anniversary-director-rian-johnson-looks-back-at-the-shows-legacy |title=Breaking Bad 10th Anniversary: Director Rian Johnson Looks Back at the Show's Legacy |publisher=IGN |first=Laura |last=Prudom |date=January 20, 2018 |accessdate=March 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhen asked about the show's lasting legacy, Johnson offered up his thoughts,\n<blockquote>\"I think the seriousness and depth with which it took its characters is the thing that really makes it stand apart for me. And that's where the power of it comes from. Obviously, starting with [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]], there's just very few stories that are told on that scale, that have a character who is that deeply considered at the center of it. And I've heard people describe it as [[Shakespearean]], and I know that word gets tossed around a lot, but I think in this case it really does apply. And that speaks, not so much to the fact that he goes to a dark place, but the fact that his entire journey is so deeply resonant, because it's so deeply considered.\"<ref name=\"ign-anniversary\"/></blockquote>\n\n== Spin-offs and adaptations ==\n=== ''Met\u00e1stasis'' ===\nOn March 13, 2013, after several days of speculation fueled by [[Univision]],<ref name=\"remake\" /> [[Sony]] confirmed that it would be making a Spanish-language remake of ''Breaking Bad'' titled ''[[Met\u00e1stasis]]'' starring [[Diego Trujillo]] as Walter Blanco (Walter White) and Roberto Urbina as Jos\u00e9 Miguel Rosas (Jesse Pinkman), alongside Sandra Reyes and [[Juli\u00e1n Arango]] in unnamed roles.<ref name=\"remakeconfirm\" /> On October 2, 2013, the cast list was revealed to include Reyes as Cielo Blanco (Skyler White) and Arango as Henry Navarro (Hank Schrader), and that the show would be set in Colombia.<ref name=\"metacast\" /> The equivalent of [[Saul Goodman]] is named Sa\u00fal Bueno.<ref name=\"ns\" />\n\n=== ''Better Call Saul'' ===\n{{main|Better Call Saul}}\nIn April 2013, it was revealed that AMC and Sony were interested in a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series that would focus on Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), with Gilligan and series writer [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] developing the project.<ref name=\"AutoHY-79\" /> In September 2013, AMC and Sony Pictures Television officially ordered ''Better Call Saul'', set as a prequel to ''Breaking Bad''.<ref name=\"AutoHY-80\" /> The series focuses on Saul's life 6 years before he became Walter's lawyer,<ref name=\"AutoHY-81\" /> and premiered on February 8, 2015.<ref name=\"AutoHY-82\" /> ''Better Call Saul'' recently finished airing its fifth season, with a sixth and final season to premiere in 2021.\n\n=== ''Talking Bad'' ===\nFrom August 11, 2013, to September 29, 2013, eight episodes of the live talk show, ''[[Talking Bad]]'', aired on AMC, following ''Breaking Bad''.

The [[exponential distribution]], [[Erlang distribution]], and [[chi-squared distribution]] are special cases of the gamma distribution.  There are three different [[Statistical parameter|parametrization]]s in common use:\n#With a [[shape parameter]] ''k'' and a [[scale parameter]] ''\u03b8''.\n#With a shape parameter {{nowrap|1=''\u03b1'' = ''k''}} and an inverse scale parameter {{nowrap|1=''\u03b2'' = 1/''\u03b8''}}, called a [[rate parameter]].\n#With a shape parameter ''k'' and a mean parameter {{nowrap|1=''\u03bc'' = ''k\u03b8'' = ''\u03b1''/''\u03b2''}}.\nIn each of these three forms, both parameters are positive real numbers.\n\nThe gamma distribution is the [[maximum entropy probability distribution]] (both with respect to a uniform base measure and with respect to a 1/''x'' base measure) for a random variable ''X'' for which '''E'''[''X''] = ''k\u03b8'' = ''\u03b1''/''\u03b2'' is fixed and greater than zero, and '''E'''[ln(''X'')] = ''\u03c8''(''k'') + ln(''\u03b8'') = ''\u03c8''(''\u03b1'') \u2212 ln(''\u03b2'') is fixed (''\u03c8'' is the [[digamma function]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Park |first1=Sung Y. |last2=Bera |first2=Anil K. |year=2009 |title=Maximum entropy autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model |journal=Journal of Econometrics |volume=150 |issue=2 |pages=219\u2013230 |url=http://www.wise.xmu.edu.cn/Master/Download/..%5C..%5CUploadFiles%5Cpaper-masterdownload%5C2009519932327055475115776.pdf |accessdate=2011-06-02 |doi=10.1016/j.jeconom.2008.12.014 |citeseerx=10.1.1.511.9750 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307144515/http://wise.xmu.edu.cn/uploadfiles/paper-masterdownload/2009519932327055475115776.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Definitions==\nThe parameterization with ''k'' and ''\u03b8'' appears to be more common in [[econometrics]] and certain other applied fields, where for example the gamma distribution is frequently used to model waiting times. For instance, in [[Accelerated life testing|life testing]], the waiting time until death is a [[random variable]] that is frequently modeled with a gamma distribution. See Hogg and Craig<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Robert V. Hogg |first=R. V. |last=Hogg |first2=A.

Hofman, [[David Blei]], arXiv.org 2014</ref> \u2013 or for that matter, the ''\u03b2'' of the gamma distribution itself. The closely related [[inverse-gamma distribution]] is used as a conjugate prior for scale parameters, such as the [[variance]] of a [[normal distribution]].\n\nIf ''k'' is a positive [[integer]], then the distribution represents an [[Erlang distribution]]; i.e., the sum of ''k'' independent [[exponential distribution|exponentially distributed]] [[random variable]]s, each of which has a mean of ''\u03b8''.\n\n===Characterization using shape ''\u03b1'' and rate ''\u03b2''===\nThe gamma distribution can be parameterized in terms of a [[shape parameter]] ''\u03b1''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''k'' and an inverse scale parameter ''\u03b2''&nbsp;= 1/''\u03b8'', called a [[rate parameter]].

Using the fact that a Gamma(1,&nbsp;1) distribution is the same as an Exp(1) distribution, and noting the method of [[exponential distribution#Generating exponential variates|generating exponential variables]], we conclude that if ''U'' is [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly distributed]] on (0, 1], then \u2212ln(''U'') is distributed Gamma(1,&nbsp;1) (i.e. [[inverse transform sampling]]). Now, using the \"''\u03b1''-addition\" property of gamma distribution, we expand this result:\n\n: <math>-\\sum_{k=1}^n \\ln U_k \\sim \\Gamma(n, 1)</math>\n\nwhere ''U''<sub>''k''</sub> are all uniformly distributed on (0, 1] and [[statistical independence|independent]]. All that is left now is to generate a variable distributed as Gamma(''\u03b4'', 1) for 0 < ''\u03b4'' < 1 and apply the \"''\u03b1''-addition\" property once more.

It is the conjugate prior for the precision (i.e. inverse of the variance) of a [[normal distribution]]. It is also the conjugate prior for the [[exponential distribution]].\n\n==Generating gamma-distributed random variables==\nGiven the scaling property above, it is enough to generate gamma variables with ''\u03b8'' = 1 as we can later convert to any value of ''\u03b2'' with simple division.\n\nSuppose we wish to generate random variables from Gamma(''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''\u03b4'',&nbsp;1), where n is a non-negative integer and 0 < ''\u03b4'' < 1. Using the fact that a Gamma(1,&nbsp;1) distribution is the same as an Exp(1) distribution, and noting the method of [[exponential distribution#Generating exponential variates|generating exponential variables]], we conclude that if ''U'' is [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly distributed]] on (0, 1], then \u2212ln(''U'') is distributed Gamma(1,&nbsp;1) (i.e. [[inverse transform sampling]]). Now, using the \"''\u03b1''-addition\" property of gamma distribution, we expand this result:\n\n: <math>-\\sum_{k=1}^n \\ln U_k \\sim \\Gamma(n, 1)</math>\n\nwhere ''U''<sub>''k''</sub> are all uniformly distributed on (0, 1] and [[statistical independence|independent]]. All that is left now is to generate a variable distributed as Gamma(''\u03b4'', 1) for 0 < ''\u03b4'' < 1 and apply the \"''\u03b1''-addition\" property once more. This is the most difficult part.\n\nRandom generation of gamma variates is discussed in detail by Devroye,<ref name=devroye>{{cite book |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=New York|year=1986 |last=Devroye |first=Luc |url=http://luc.devroye.org/rnbookindex.html |title=Non-Uniform Random Variate Generation |ref=harv |isbn=978-0-387-96305-1}} See Chapter 9, Section 3.</ref>{{Rp|401\u2013428}} noting that none are uniformly fast for all shape parameters.

Instead he recommends using either rejection-based or table-based methods, depending on context.<ref name=devroye/>{{Rp|401\u2013428}}\n\nFor example, Marsaglia's simple transformation-rejection method relying on one normal variate ''X'' and one uniform variate ''U'':<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Marsaglia|first1=G. |last2=Tsang |first2=W.

The acceptance rate does depend on ''k'', with an acceptance rate of 0.95, 0.98, and 0.99 for k=1, 2, and 4.  For ''k''&nbsp;<&nbsp;1, one can use <math> \\gamma_\\alpha = \\gamma_{1+\\alpha} U^{1/\\alpha}</math> to boost ''k'' to be usable with this method.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{wikibooks|Statistics|Distributions/Gamma|Gamma distribution}}\n* {{springer|title=Gamma-distribution|id=p/g043300}}\n*  {{MathWorld|urlname=GammaDistribution|title=Gamma distribution}}\n* ModelAssist (2017) [http://www.epixanalytics.com/modelassist/AtRisk/Model_Assist.htm#Distributions/Continuous_distributions/Gamma.htm Uses of the gamma distribution in risk modeling, including applied examples in Excel].\n* [http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda366b.htm Engineering Statistics Handbook]\n\n{{ProbDistributions|continuous-semi-infinite}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gamma Distribution}}\n[[Category:Continuous distributions]]\n[[Category:Factorial and binomial topics]]\n[[Category:Conjugate prior distributions]]\n[[Category:Exponential family distributions]]\n[[Category:Infinitely divisible probability distributions]]\n[[Category:Survival analysis]]\n", "name_user": "Jpowers154", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMaximum likelihood estimation:Minor correction to log-likelihood.
