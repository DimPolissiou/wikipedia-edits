This marginal constituency has been represented by both the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] parties since the [[Second World War]]. It was held by the Conservatives until 1997, when [[Gordon Marsden]], gained it for Labour. He represented the seat for the next 22 years but was defeated in [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019]] by the Conservative [[Scott Benton (politician)|Scott Benton]].\n\n==Constituency profile==\n\nThe seat encompasses the central and southern parts of Blackpool, including the famous [[Blackpool Tower]], the three piers and the [[Blackpool Pleasure Beach|Pleasure Beach]]. Also included is the Bloomfield area, home to [[Blackpool F.C]]. In the southern end of the seat, near to the [[Borough of Fylde|Fylde]] border, Squires Gate is the site of [[Blackpool Airport]].\n\nTourism is a major industry in the area, and while Blackpool has been less affected by the decline in domestic holidaymaking than some resorts, there are nonetheless some run-down areas which were once rather more glamorous. Traditionally seaside seats were very safe for the Conservative Party, but for some time it seemed unlikely that the party would win it back. However, they were able to do so in [[2019 UK general election|2019]] when they finally achieved a sizeable majority with many gains in the north of England.\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''1945\u20131950''': The County Borough of Blackpool wards of Marton, Stanley, Victoria, and Waterloo, and the Municipal Borough of Lytham St Annes.\n\n'''1950\u20131983''': The County Borough of Blackpool wards of

This marginal constituency has been represented by both the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] parties since the [[Second World War]]. It was held by the Conservatives until 1997, when [[Gordon Marsden]], gained it for Labour. He represented the seat for the next 22 years but was defeated in [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019]] by the Conservative [[Scott Benton (politician)|Scott Benton]].\n\n==Constituency profile==\n\nThe seat encompasses the central and southern parts of Blackpool, including the famous [[Blackpool Tower]], the three piers and the [[Blackpool Pleasure Beach|Pleasure Beach]]. Also included is the suburb of Layton to the east and the Bloomfield area, home to [[Blackpool F.C]]. In the southern end of the seat, near to the [[Borough of Fylde|Fylde]] border, Squires Gate is the site of [[Blackpool Airport]].\n\nTourism is a major industry in the area, and while Blackpool has been less affected by the decline in domestic holidaymaking than some resorts, there are nonetheless some run-down areas which were once rather more glamorous. Traditionally seaside seats were very safe for the Conservative Party, but for some time it seemed unlikely that the party would win it back. However, they were able to do so in [[2019 UK general election|2019]] when they finally achieved a sizeable majority with many gains in the north of England.\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''1945\u20131950''': The County Borough of Blackpool wards of Marton, Stanley, Victoria, and Waterloo, and the Municipal Borough of Lytham St Annes.\n\n'''1950\u20131983''': The County Borough of Blackpool wards of

He overthrew his father and ruled during the mythological [[Golden Age]], until he was overthrown by his own son [[Zeus]] and imprisoned in [[Tartarus]]. According to [[Plato]], however, the deities [[Phorcys]], Cronus, and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] were the eldest children of [[Oceanus]] and [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]].<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Tim.+40e&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0180 Plato. ''Timaeus 40e.''] Translated by W.R.M. Lamb. Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1925.</ref>\n\nCronus was usually depicted with a [[harpe]], [[scythe]] or a [[sickle]], which was the instrument he used to [[castrate]] and depose Uranus, his father. In [[Athens]], on the twelfth day of the Attic month of [[Attic calendar|Hekatombaion]], a festival called [[Kronia]] was held in honour of Cronus to celebrate the harvest, suggesting that, as a result of his association with the virtuous Golden Age, Cronus continued to preside as a [[List of agricultural gods|patron of the harvest]]. Cronus was also identified in [[classical antiquity]] with the [[Roman mythology|Roman deity]] [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]].\n\n== Mythology ==\nIn an ancient myth recorded by [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', Cronus envied the power of his father, the ruler of the universe, Uranus. Uranus drew the enmity of Cronus's mother, [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], when he hid the gigantic youngest children of Gaia, the hundred-handed [[Hecatoncheires]] and one-eyed [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]], in [[Tartarus]], so that they would not see the light. Gaia created [[harpe|a great stone sickle]] and gathered together Cronus and his brothers to persuade them to castrate Uranus.<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:139-172 154\u2013166].</ref>\n\n[[File:The Mutiliation of Uranus by Saturn.jpg|left|thumb|[[Giorgio Vasari]]: The Mutilation of Uranus by Saturn (Cronus)|233x233px]]\n\nOnly Cronus was willing to do the deed, so Gaia gave him the sickle and placed him in ambush.<ref> [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:139-172 167\u2013206.] .</ref> When Uranus met with Gaia, Cronus attacked him with the sickle, [[castration|castrating]] him and casting his [[testicles]] into the sea. From the [[blood]] that spilled out from Uranus and fell upon the earth, the [[Gigantes]], [[Erinyes]], and [[Meliae]] were produced. The testicles produced a white foam from which the goddess [[Aphrodite]] emerged. For this, Uranus threatened vengeance and called his sons ''Titenes''<ref group=lower-alpha>\u03a4\u03b9\u03c4\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2; according to Hesiod meaning \"straining ones,\" the source of the word \"titan\", but this etymology is disputed.</ref> for overstepping their boundaries and daring to commit such an act.<ref group=lower-alpha>in an alternate version of this myth, a more benevolent Cronus overthrew the wicked serpentine Titan [[Ophion]] and in doing so he released the world from bondage and for a time ruled it justly.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter dispatching Uranus, Cronus re-imprisoned the Hecatoncheires, and the Cyclopes and set the dragon [[Campe]] to guard them. He and his older sister [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] took the throne of the world as king and queen. The period in which Cronus ruled was called the [[golden age|Golden Age]], as the people of the time had no need for laws or rules; everyone did the right thing, and immorality was absent.\n\n[[File:Rubens saturn.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Painting by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] of Cronus devouring one of his children]]\n\nCronus learned from Gaia and Uranus that he was destined to be overcome by his own sons, just as he had overthrown his father. As a result, although he sired the gods [[Demeter]], [[Hestia]], [[Hera]], [[Hades]] and [[Poseidon]] by Rhea, he devoured them all as soon as they were born to prevent the prophecy. When the sixth child, [[Zeus]], was born Rhea sought Gaia to devise a plan to save them and to eventually get retribution on Cronus for his acts against his father and children. See more about the rebellion of Kronos against Oaranus here:https://notionpress.com/read/terrific-terror-and-the-weakening-mist\n\nRhea secretly gave birth to Zeus in [[Crete]], and handed Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes, also known as the [[Omphalos]] Stone, which he promptly swallowed, thinking that it was his son.\n\nRhea kept Zeus hidden in a cave on [[Mount Ida, Crete]]. According to some versions of the story, he was then raised by a goat named [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]], while a company of [[Korybantes|Kouretes]], armored male dancers, shouted and clapped their hands to make enough noise to mask the baby's cries from Cronus. Other versions of the myth have Zeus raised by the [[nymph]] [[Adamanthea]], who hid Zeus by dangling him by a rope from a tree so that he was suspended between the earth, the sea, and the sky, all of which were ruled by his father, Cronus. Still other versions of the tale say that Zeus was raised by his grandmother, Gaia.\n\nOnce he had grown up, Zeus used an [[emetic]] given to him by Gaia to force Cronus to disgorge the contents of his stomach in reverse order: first the stone, which was set down at Pytho under the glens of [[Mount Parnassus]] to be a sign to mortal men, and then his two brothers and three sisters. In other versions of the tale, [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]] gave Cronus an emetic to force him to disgorge the children.<ref>[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1.2.1 1.2.1].</ref>\n\nAfter freeing his siblings, Zeus released the Hecatoncheires, and the Cyclopes who forged for him his thunderbolts, Poseidon's trident and Hades' helmet of darkness. In a vast war called the [[Titanomachy]], Zeus and his older brothers and older sisters, with the help of the Hecatoncheires and Cyclopes, overthrew Cronus and the other Titans. Afterwards, many of the Titans were confined in [[Tartarus]]. However, Oceanus, Helios, Atlas, Prometheus, Epimetheus and Menoetius were not imprisoned following the Titanomachy.  Gaia bore the monster [[Typhon]] to claim revenge for the imprisoned Titans.\n\nAccounts of the fate of Cronus after the Titanomachy differ. In [[Homer]]ic and other texts he is imprisoned with the other Titans in Tartarus. In Orphic poems, he is imprisoned for eternity in the cave of Nyx. Pindar describes his release from Tartarus, where he is made King of [[Elysium]] by Zeus. In another version,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} the Titans released the Cyclopes from Tartarus, and Cronus was awarded the kingship among them, beginning a Golden Age. In [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'',<ref>{{cite book |author-link=Vergil |author=Vergil |title=[[Aeneid]] |chapter=Book&nbsp;VIII, pp&nbsp;323&nbsp;ff |chapter-url=http://classics.mit.edu/Virgil/aeneid.8.viii.html}}</ref> it is [[Latium]] to which Saturn (Cronus) escapes and ascends as king and lawgiver, following his defeat by his son Jupiter (Zeus).\n\nOne other account referred by [[Robert Graves]],<ref>Graves, Robert, ''Hebrew Myths'' 21.4</ref> who claims to be following the account of the Byzantine mythographer [[Tzetzes]], it is said that Cronus was castrated by his son Zeus just like he had done with his father Uranus before. However the subject of a son castrating his own father, or simply castration in general, was so repudiated by the Greek mythographers of that time that they suppressed it from their accounts until the Christian era (when Tzetzes wrote).\n\n[[File:Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem - The Fall of the Titans - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[The Fall of the Titans]]'', [[Cornelis Cornelisz van Haarlem]], 1596-1598]]\n\n=== Libyan account by Diodorus Siculus ===\n\nIn a Libyan account related by [[Diodorus Siculus]] (Book 3), Uranus and Titaea were the parents of Cronus and Rhea and the other Titans. Ammon, a king of [[Libya]], married Rhea (3.18.1).  However, Rhea abandoned Ammon and married her younger brother Cronus.  With Rhea's incitement, Cronus and the other Titans made war upon Ammon, who fled to Crete (3.71.1-2). Cronus ruled harshly and Cronus in turn was defeated by Ammon's son Dionysus (3.71.3-3.73) who appointed Cronus' and Rhea's son, Zeus, as king of Egypt (3.73.4). Dionysus and Zeus then joined their forces to defeat the remaining Titans in Crete, and on the death of Dionysus, Zeus inherited all the kingdoms, becoming lord of the world (3.73.7-8).\n\n=== Sibylline Oracles ===\nCronus is mentioned in the ''[[Sibylline Oracles]]'', particularly in book three, which makes Cronus, 'Titan' and [[Iapetus (mythology)|Iapetus]], the three sons of Uranus and Gaia, each to receive a third division of the Earth, and Cronus is made king over all. After the death of Uranus, Titan's sons attempt to destroy Cronus's and Rhea's male offspring as soon as they are born, but at [[Dodona]], Rhea secretly bears her sons Zeus, Poseidon and Hades and sends them to [[Phrygia]] to be raised in the care of three Cretans. Upon learning this, sixty of Titan's men then imprison Cronus and Rhea, causing the sons of Cronus to declare and fight the first of all wars against them. This account mentions nothing about Cronus either killing his father or attempting to kill any of his children.\n\n=== Other accounts ===\nCronus was said to be the father of the wise centaur Chiron by the [[Oceanid]] [[Philyra (Oceanid)|Philyra]] who was later on, transformed into a linden tree.<ref>[[Tzetzes]] on [[Lycophron]], 1200</ref><ref>[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Natural History'' 7. 197</ref><ref name=\":0\">[[Scholia]] on [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'' 2.1235 citing [[Pherecydes of Athens|Pherecydes]]</ref> The Titan chased the nymph and consorted with her in the shape of a stallion, hence the half-human, half-equine shape of their offspring;<ref>[[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'' 2. 1231 ff</ref><ref>[[Scholia]] on [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'' 1. 554</ref> this was said to have taken place on Mount [[Pelion]].<ref>Callimachus, Hymn 4 to [[Delos]] 104 ff</ref>\n\nTwo other sons of Cronus and Philyra may have been [[Dolops]]<ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'', Preface</ref> and Aphrus, the ancestor and [[eponym]] of the Aphroi, i.e. the native [[Demographics of Africa|Africans]].<ref>[[Suda]] s.v.

English ''[[:wikt:shear|shear]]''), motivated by Cronus's characteristic act of \"cutting the sky\" (or the genitals of anthropomorphic Uranus).\nThe Indo-Iranian reflex of the root is ''kar'', generally meaning \"to make, create\" (whence ''[[karma]]''), but Janda argues that the original meaning \"to cut\" in a cosmogonic sense is still preserved in some verses of the [[Rigveda]] pertaining to [[Indra]]'s heroic \"cutting\", like that of Cronus resulting in creation:\n\n{{quote|quote=[[Mandala 10|RV 10]].104.10 ''{{IAST|\u0101rdayad v\u1e5btram ak\u1e5b\u1e47od uloka\u1e43}}''<br/>he hit [[Vrtra]] fatally, cutting [> creating] a free path.<br/>\n[[Mandala 6|RV 6]].47.4 ''{{IAST|var\u1e63m\u0101\u1e47a\u1e43 divo ak\u1e5b\u1e47od}}''<br/>he cut [> created] the loftiness of the sky.}}\n\nThis may point to an older [[Proto-Indo-European mythology|Indo-European mytheme]] reconstructed as ''{{PIE|*(s)kert wersmn diwos}}'' \"by means of a cut he created the loftiness of the sky\".<ref>Michael Janda, ''Die Musik nach dem Chaos'', Innsbruck, 2010, 54-56.</ref>\nThe myth of Cronus castrating Uranus parallels the ''[[Song of Kumarbi]]'', where  [[Anu (god)|Anu]] (the heavens) is castrated by Kumarbi.

The association was recorded c. AD 100 by [[Philo of Byblos]]' Phoenician history, as reported in [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]]' ''Pr\u00e6paratio Evangelica'' I.10.16.<ref>Walcot, \"Five or Seven Recesses?\" ''The Classical Quarterly'', New Series, '''15'''.1 (May 1965), p. 79. The quote stands as Philo Fr. 2.</ref> Philo's account, ascribed by Eusebius to the semi-legendary pre-[[Trojan War]] [[Phoenicia]]n historian [[Sanchuniathon]], indicates that Cronus was originally a [[Canaan]]ite ruler who founded [[Byblos]] and was subsequently deified.  This version gives his alternate name as ''Elus'' or ''Ilus'', and states that in the 32nd year of his reign, he emasculated, slew and deified his father Epigeius or Autochthon \"whom they afterwards called Uranus\". It further states that after ships were invented, Cronus, visiting the 'inhabitable world', bequeathed [[Attica]] to his own daughter [[Athena]], and [[Egypt]] to [[Taautus]] the son of [[Misor]] and inventor of writing.<ref>Eusebius of Caesarea: ''Praeparatio Evangelica'' Book 1, Chapter 10.</ref>\n\n=== Roman mythology and later culture ===\n{{Main|Saturn (mythology)}}\n\n[[File:ForumRomanum.jpg|thumb|right|4th-century Temple of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] in the [[Roman Forum]].]]\nWhile the Greeks considered Cronus a cruel and tempestuous force of chaos and disorder, believing the Olympian gods had brought an era of peace and order by seizing power from the crude and malicious Titans,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} the Romans took a more positive and innocuous view of the deity, by conflating their indigenous deity [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] with Cronus. Consequently, while the Greeks considered Cronus merely an intermediary stage between Uranus and Zeus, he was a larger aspect of [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]]. The [[Saturnalia]] was a festival dedicated in his honour, and at least one [[Temple of Saturn|temple to Saturn]] already existed in the archaic [[Roman Kingdom]].\n\nHis association with the \"Saturnian\" Golden Age eventually caused him to become the god of \"time\", i.e., calendars, seasons, and harvests\u2014not now confused with [[Chronos]], the unrelated embodiment of time in general. Nevertheless, among [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] scholars in Alexandria and during the [[Renaissance]], Cronus was conflated with the name of ''[[Chronos]]'', the personification of \"[[Father Time]]\",<ref name=\"perseus.tufts\" /> wielding the harvesting scythe.\n\nAs a result of Cronus's importance to the Romans, his Roman variant, Saturn, has had a large influence on [[Western culture]]. The seventh day of the Judaeo-Christian week is called in [[Latin]] ''Dies Saturni'' (\"Day of Saturn\"), which in turn was adapted and became the source of the [[English language|English]] word ''Saturday''. In [[astronomy]], the [[Saturn (planet)|planet Saturn]] is named after the Roman deity.

In [[Athens]], on the twelfth day of the Attic month of [[Attic calendar|Hekatombaion]], a festival called [[Kronia]] was held in honour of Cronus to celebrate the harvest, suggesting that, as a result of his association with the virtuous Golden Age, Cronus continued to preside as a [[List of agricultural gods|patron of the harvest]]. Cronus was also identified in [[classical antiquity]] with the [[Roman mythology|Roman deity]] [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]].\n\n== Mythology ==\nIn an ancient myth recorded by [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', Cronus envied the power of his father, the ruler of the universe, Uranus. Uranus drew the enmity of Cronus's mother, [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], when he hid the gigantic youngest children of Gaia, the hundred-handed [[Hecatoncheires]] and one-eyed [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]], in [[Tartarus]], so that they would not see the light. Gaia created [[harpe|a great stone sickle]] and gathered together Cronus and his brothers to persuade them to castrate Uranus.<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:139-172 154\u2013166].</ref>\n\n[[File:The Mutiliation of Uranus by Saturn.jpg|left|thumb|[[Giorgio Vasari]]: The Mutilation of Uranus by Saturn (Cronus)|233x233px]]\n\nOnly Cronus was willing to do the deed, so Gaia gave him the sickle and placed him in ambush.<ref> [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:139-172 167\u2013206.] .</ref> When Uranus met with Gaia, Cronus attacked him with the sickle, [[castration|castrating]] him and casting his [[testicles]] into the sea. From the [[blood]] that spilled out from Uranus and fell upon the earth, the [[Gigantes]], [[Erinyes]], and [[Meliae]] were produced. The testicles produced a white foam from which the goddess [[Aphrodite]] emerged. For this, Uranus threatened vengeance and called his sons ''Titenes''<ref group=lower-alpha>\u03a4\u03b9\u03c4\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2; according to Hesiod meaning \"straining ones,\" the source of the word \"titan\", but this etymology is disputed.</ref> for overstepping their boundaries and daring to commit such an act.<ref group=lower-alpha>in an alternate version of this myth, a more benevolent Cronus overthrew the wicked serpentine Titan [[Ophion]] and in doing so he released the world from bondage and for a time ruled it justly.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter dispatching Uranus, Cronus re-imprisoned the Hecatoncheires, and the Cyclopes and set the dragon [[Campe]] to guard them. He and his older sister [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] took the throne of the world as king and queen. The period in which Cronus ruled was called the [[golden age|Golden Age]], as the people of the time had no need for laws or rules; everyone did the right thing, and immorality was absent.\n\n[[File:Rubens saturn.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Painting by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] of Cronus devouring one of his children]]\n\nCronus learned from Gaia and Uranus that he was destined to be overcome by his own sons, just as he had overthrown his father. As a result, although he sired the gods [[Demeter]], [[Hestia]], [[Hera]], [[Hades]] and [[Poseidon]] by Rhea, he devoured them all as soon as they were born to prevent the prophecy. When the sixth child, [[Zeus]], was born Rhea sought Gaia to devise a plan to save them and to eventually get retribution on Cronus for his acts against his father and children.\n\nRhea secretly gave birth to Zeus in [[Crete]], and handed Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes, also known as the [[Omphalos]] Stone, which he promptly swallowed, thinking that it was his son.\n\nRhea kept Zeus hidden in a cave on [[Mount Ida, Crete]]. According to some versions of the story, he was then raised by a goat named [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]], while a company of [[Korybantes|Kouretes]], armored male dancers, shouted and clapped their hands to make enough noise to mask the baby's cries from Cronus. Other versions of the myth have Zeus raised by the [[nymph]] [[Adamanthea]], who hid Zeus by dangling him by a rope from a tree so that he was suspended between the earth, the sea, and the sky, all of which were ruled by his father, Cronus. Still other versions of the tale say that Zeus was raised by his grandmother, Gaia.\n\nOnce he had grown up, Zeus used an [[emetic]] given to him by Gaia to force Cronus to disgorge the contents of his stomach in reverse order: first the stone, which was set down at Pytho under the glens of [[Mount Parnassus]] to be a sign to mortal men, and then his two brothers and three sisters. In other versions of the tale, [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]] gave Cronus an emetic to force him to disgorge the children.<ref>[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1.2.1 1.2.1].</ref>\n\nAfter freeing his siblings, Zeus released the Hecatoncheires, and the Cyclopes who forged for him his thunderbolts, Poseidon's trident and Hades' helmet of darkness. In a vast war called the [[Titanomachy]], Zeus and his older brothers and older sisters, with the help of the Hecatoncheires and Cyclopes, overthrew Cronus and the other Titans. Afterwards, many of the Titans were confined in [[Tartarus]]. However, Oceanus, Helios, Atlas, Prometheus, Epimetheus and Menoetius were not imprisoned following the Titanomachy.  Gaia bore the monster [[Typhon]] to claim revenge for the imprisoned Titans.\n\nAccounts of the fate of Cronus after the Titanomachy differ. In [[Homer]]ic and other texts he is imprisoned with the other Titans in Tartarus. In Orphic poems, he is imprisoned for eternity in the cave of Nyx. Pindar describes his release from Tartarus, where he is made King of [[Elysium]] by Zeus. In another version,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} the Titans released the Cyclopes from Tartarus, and Cronus was awarded the kingship among them, beginning a Golden Age. In [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'',<ref>{{cite book |author-link=Vergil |author=Vergil |title=[[Aeneid]] |chapter=Book&nbsp;VIII, pp&nbsp;323&nbsp;ff |chapter-url=http://classics.mit.edu/Virgil/aeneid.8.viii.html}}</ref> it is [[Latium]] to which Saturn (Cronus) escapes and ascends as king and lawgiver, following his defeat by his son Jupiter (Zeus).\n\nOne other account referred by [[Robert Graves]],<ref>Graves, Robert, ''Hebrew Myths'' 21.4</ref> who claims to be following the account of the Byzantine mythographer [[Tzetzes]], it is said that Cronus was castrated by his son Zeus just like he had done with his father Uranus before. However the subject of a son castrating his own father, or simply castration in general, was so repudiated by the Greek mythographers of that time that they suppressed it from their accounts until the Christian era (when Tzetzes wrote).\n\n[[File:Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem - The Fall of the Titans - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[The Fall of the Titans]]'', [[Cornelis Cornelisz van Haarlem]], 1596-1598]]\n\n=== Libyan account by Diodorus Siculus ===\n\nIn a Libyan account related by [[Diodorus Siculus]] (Book 3), Uranus and Titaea were the parents of Cronus and Rhea and the other Titans. Ammon, a king of [[Libya]], married Rhea (3.18.1).  However, Rhea abandoned Ammon and married her younger brother Cronus.  With Rhea's incitement, Cronus and the other Titans made war upon Ammon, who fled to Crete (3.71.1-2). Cronus ruled harshly and Cronus in turn was defeated by Ammon's son Dionysus (3.71.3-3.73) who appointed Cronus' and Rhea's son, Zeus, as king of Egypt (3.73.4). Dionysus and Zeus then joined their forces to defeat the remaining Titans in Crete, and on the death of Dionysus, Zeus inherited all the kingdoms, becoming lord of the world (3.73.7-8).\n\n=== Sibylline Oracles ===\nCronus is mentioned in the ''[[Sibylline Oracles]]'', particularly in book three, which makes Cronus, 'Titan' and [[Iapetus (mythology)|Iapetus]], the three sons of Uranus and Gaia, each to receive a third division of the Earth, and Cronus is made king over all. After the death of Uranus, Titan's sons attempt to destroy Cronus's and Rhea's male offspring as soon as they are born, but at [[Dodona]], Rhea secretly bears her sons Zeus, Poseidon and Hades and sends them to [[Phrygia]] to be raised in the care of three Cretans. Upon learning this, sixty of Titan's men then imprison Cronus and Rhea, causing the sons of Cronus to declare and fight the first of all wars against them. This account mentions nothing about Cronus either killing his father or attempting to kill any of his children.\n\n=== Other accounts ===\nCronus was said to be the father of the wise centaur Chiron by the [[Oceanid]] [[Philyra (Oceanid)|Philyra]] who was later on, transformed into a linden tree.<ref>[[Tzetzes]] on [[Lycophron]], 1200</ref><ref>[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Natural History'' 7. 197</ref><ref name=\":0\">[[Scholia]] on [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'' 2.1235 citing [[Pherecydes of Athens|Pherecydes]]</ref> The Titan chased the nymph and consorted with her in the shape of a stallion, hence the half-human, half-equine shape of their offspring;<ref>[[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'' 2. 1231 ff</ref><ref>[[Scholia]] on [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'' 1. 554</ref> this was said to have taken place on Mount [[Pelion]].<ref>Callimachus, Hymn 4 to [[Delos]] 104 ff</ref>\n\nTwo other sons of Cronus and Philyra may have been [[Dolops]]<ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'', Preface</ref> and Aphrus, the ancestor and [[eponym]] of the Aphroi, i.e. the native [[Demographics of Africa|Africans]].<ref>[[Suda]] s.v.

BRILL, 2001; pg. 316</ref>\n\n=== From the Renaissance to the present ===\nDuring the [[Renaissance]], the identification of Cronus and Chronos gave rise to \"[[Father Time]]\" wielding the harvesting scythe.\n[[H.&nbsp;J. Rose]] in 1928<ref>Rose, ''A Handbook of Greek Mythology'' 1928:43.</ref> observed that attempts to give \"\u039a\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2\" a Greek etymology had failed.\nRecently, Janda (2010) offers a genuinely Indo-European etymology of \"the cutter\", from the root ''*(s)ker-'' \"to cut\" (Greek [[:wikt:\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03c9|\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03c9]] (''keir\u014d''), cf. English ''[[:wikt:shear|shear]]''), motivated by Cronus's characteristic act of \"cutting the sky\" (or the genitals of anthropomorphic Uranus).\nThe Indo-Iranian reflex of the root is ''kar'', generally meaning \"to make, create\" (whence ''[[karma]]''), but Janda argues that the original meaning \"to cut\" in a cosmogonic sense is still preserved in some verses of the [[Rigveda]] pertaining to [[Indra]]'s heroic \"cutting\", like that of Cronus resulting in creation:\n\n{{quote|quote=[[Mandala 10|RV 10]].104.10 ''{{IAST|\u0101rdayad v\u1e5btram ak\u1e5b\u1e47od uloka\u1e43}}''<br/>he hit [[Vrtra]] fatally, cutting [> creating] a free path.<br/>\n[[Mandala 6|RV 6]].47.4 ''{{IAST|var\u1e63m\u0101\u1e47a\u1e43 divo ak\u1e5b\u1e47od}}''<br/>he cut [> created] the loftiness of the sky.}}\n\nThis may point to an older [[Proto-Indo-European mythology|Indo-European mytheme]] reconstructed as ''{{PIE|*(s)kert wersmn diwos}}'' \"by means of a cut he created the loftiness of the sky\".<ref>Michael Janda, ''Die Musik nach dem Chaos'', Innsbruck, 2010, 54-56.</ref>\nThe myth of Cronus castrating Uranus parallels the ''[[Song of Kumarbi]]'', where  [[Anu (god)|Anu]] (the heavens) is castrated by Kumarbi.

It further states that after ships were invented, Cronus, visiting the 'inhabitable world', bequeathed [[Attica]] to his own daughter [[Athena]], and [[Egypt]] to [[Taautus]] the son of [[Misor]] and inventor of writing.<ref>Eusebius of Caesarea: ''Praeparatio Evangelica'' Book 1, Chapter 10.</ref>\n\n=== Roman mythology and later culture ===\n{{Main|Saturn (mythology)}}\n\n[[File:ForumRomanum.jpg|thumb|right|4th-century Temple of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] in the [[Roman Forum]].]]\nWhile the Greeks considered Cronus a cruel and tempestuous force of chaos and disorder, believing the Olympian gods had brought an era of peace and order by seizing power from the crude and malicious Titans,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} the Romans took a more positive and innocuous view of the deity, by conflating their indigenous deity [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] with Cronus. Consequently, while the Greeks considered Cronus merely an intermediary stage between Uranus and Zeus, he was a larger aspect of [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]]. The [[Saturnalia]] was a festival dedicated in his honour, and at least one [[Temple of Saturn|temple to Saturn]] already existed in the archaic [[Roman Kingdom]].\n\nHis association with the \"Saturnian\" Golden Age eventually caused him to become the god of \"time\", i.e., calendars, seasons, and harvests\u2014not now confused with [[Chronos]], the unrelated embodiment of time in general. Nevertheless, among [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] scholars in Alexandria and during the [[Renaissance]], Cronus was conflated with the name of ''[[Chronos]]'', the personification of \"[[Father Time]]\",<ref name=\"perseus.tufts\" /> wielding the harvesting scythe.\n\nAs a result of Cronus's importance to the Romans, his Roman variant, Saturn, has had a large influence on [[Western culture]]. The seventh day of the Judaeo-Christian week is called in [[Latin]] ''Dies Saturni'' (\"Day of Saturn\"), which in turn was adapted and became the source of the [[English language|English]] word ''Saturday''. In [[astronomy]], the [[Saturn (planet)|planet Saturn]] is named after the Roman deity.

The barge that carried it had a huge mast of fir wood which four men's arms could not encircle. One hundred and twenty bushels of lentils were needed for ballast. Having fulfilled its purpose, the gigantic vessel was no longer wanted. Therefore, filled with stones and cement, it was sunk to form the foundations of the foremost quay of the new harbour at [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]].<ref>[[James Lees-Milne]], ''Saint Peter's'' (1967).</ref>}}\n\nPope [[Sixtus V]] was determined to erect the obelisk in front of St Peter's, of which the nave was yet to be built. He had a full-sized wooden mock-up erected within months of his election. [[Domenico Fontana]], the assistant of [[Giacomo Della Porta]] in the Basilica's construction, presented the Pope with a little model crane of wood and a heavy little obelisk of lead, which Sixtus himself was able to raise by turning a little winch with his finger. Fontana was given the project. Half-buried in the debris of the ages, it was first excavated as it stood; then it took from 30 April to 17 May 1586 to move it on rollers to the Piazza: it required nearly 1000 men, 140 carthorses, and 47 cranes. The re-erection, scheduled for 14 September, the Feast of the [[Exaltation of the Cross]], was watched by a large crowd.

The obelisk was erected by either [[Ashurnasirpal I]] (1050\u20131031 BC) or [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883\u2013859 BC). The obelisk bears an inscription that refers to the king's seizure of goods, people and herds, which he carried back to the city of Ashur. The reliefs of the Obelisk depict military campaigns, hunting, victory banquets and scenes of tribute bearing.\n\nThe Rassam Obelisk, named after its discoverer [[Hormuzd Rassam]], was found on the citadel of [[Nimrud]] (ancient Kalhu). It was erected by Ashurnasirpal II, though only survives in fragments.

The obelisk was erected by [[Shalmaneser III]] and the reliefs depict scenes of tribute bearing as well as the depiction of two subdued rulers, [[Jehu]] the Israelite and Sua the Gilzanean, giving gestures of submission to the king. The reliefs on the obelisk have accompanying epigraphs, but besides these the obelisk also possesses a longer inscription that records one of the latest versions of Shalmaneser III's annals, covering the period from his accessional year to his 33rd regnal year.\n\nThe Broken Obelisk, that was also discovered by Rassam at Nineveh.

Together with ({{convert|21|m|ft|disp=or|adj=mid|-high}}) [[King Ezana's Stele]], the last erected one and the only unbroken, the most famous example of axumite obelisk is the so-called ({{convert|24|m|ft|disp=or|adj=mid|-high}}h) [[Obelisk of Axum]]. It was carved around the 4th century AD and, in the course of time, it collapsed and broke into three parts. In these conditions it was found by Italian soldiers in 1935, after the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]], looted and taken to Rome in 1937, where it stood in the Piazza di [[Porta Capena]]. Italy agreed in a 1947 UN agreement to return the obelisk but did not affirm its agreement until 1997, after years of pressure and various controversial settlements. In 2003 the Italian government made the first steps toward its return, and in 2008 it was finally re-erected.\n\nThe largest known obelisk, the [[Great Stele]] at [[Axum]], now fallen, at {{convert|33|m}} high and {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} at the base ({{convert|520|MT|ST|disp=or}})<ref>\"The Seventy Wonders of the Ancient World\" edited by Chris scarre 1999</ref> is one of the largest single pieces of stone ever worked in human history (the largest is either at [[Baalbek]] or the [[Ramesseum]]) and probably fell during erection or soon after, destroying a large part of the massive burial chamber underneath it. The obelisks, properly termed [[stela]]e or the native ''[[hawilt]]'' or ''hawilti'' as they do not end in a pyramid, were used to mark graves and underground burial chambers. The largest of the grave markers were for royal burial chambers and were decorated with multi-storey false windows and false doors, while nobility would have smaller less decorated ones. While there are only a few large ones standing, there are hundreds of smaller ones in \"stelae fields\".\n\n===Ancient Roman===\nThe Romans commissioned obelisks in an ancient Egyptian style.

This was the third attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk; the first two, in 1994 and 1999, ended in failure. There were also two successful attempts to raise a two-ton obelisk and a nine-ton obelisk. Finally in August\u2013September 1999, after learning from their experiences, they were able to erect one successfully.\n\nFirst Hopkins and Rais Abdel Aleem organized an experiment to tow a block of stone weighing about 25 tons. They prepared a path by embedding wooden rails into the ground and placing a sledge on them bearing a megalith weighing about 25 tons. Initially they used more than 100 people to try to tow it but were unable to budge it. Finally, with well over 130 people pulling at once and an additional dozen using levers to prod the sledge forward, they moved it. Over the course of a day, the workers towed it 10 to 20 feet. Despite problems with broken ropes, they proved the monument could be moved this way.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990314.html \"Dispatches\"], NOVA</ref> Additional experiments were done in Egypt and other locations to tow megalithic stone with ancient technologies, some of which are [[List of megalithic sites#List of efforts to move and install stones|listed here]].\n\nOne experiment was to transport a small obelisk on a barge in the Nile River. The barge was built based on ancient Egyptian designs. It had to be very wide to handle the obelisk, with a 2 to 1 ratio length to width, and it was at least twice as long as the obelisk. The obelisk was about {{convert|10|ft|m|order=flip}} long and no more than {{convert|5|MT|ST}}. A barge big enough to transport the largest Egyptian obelisks with this ratio would have had to be close to {{convert|200|ft|m|order=flip|adj=mid|-long}} and {{convert|100|ft|m|order=flip|adj=mid|-wide}}. The workers used ropes that were wrapped around a guide that enabled them to pull away from the river while they were towing it onto the barge. The barge was successfully launched into the Nile.\n\nThe final and successful erection event was organized by Rick Brown, Hopkins, Lehner and Gregg Mullen in a Massachusetts quarry. The preparation work was done with modern technology, but experiments have proven that with enough time and people, it could have been done with ancient technology. To begin, the obelisk was lying on a gravel and stone ramp. A pit in the middle was filled with dry sand. Previous experiments showed that wet sand would not flow as well. The ramp was secured by stone walls. Men raised the obelisk by slowly removing the sand while three crews of men pulled on ropes to control its descent into the pit. The back wall was designed to guide the obelisk into its proper place. The obelisk had to catch a turning groove which would prevent it from sliding. They used brake ropes to prevent it from going too far. Such turning grooves had been found on the ancient pedestals. Gravity did most of the work until the final 15\u00b0 had to be completed by pulling the obelisk forward. They used brake ropes again to make sure it did not fall forward. On 12 September they completed the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990827.html |title=Mysteries of the Nile &#124; August 27, 1999: The Third Attempt |publisher=Pbs.org |date=27 August 1999 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nThis experiment has been used to explain how the obelisks may have been erected in Luxor and other locations.

He had a full-sized wooden mock-up erected within months of his election. [[Domenico Fontana]], the assistant of [[Giacomo Della Porta]] in the Basilica's construction, presented the Pope with a little model crane of wood and a heavy little obelisk of lead, which Sixtus himself was able to raise by turning a little winch with his finger. Fontana was given the project. Half-buried in the debris of the ages, it was first excavated as it stood; then it took from 30 April to 17 May 1586 to move it on rollers to the Piazza: it required nearly 1000 men, 140 carthorses, and 47 cranes. The re-erection, scheduled for 14 September, the Feast of the [[Exaltation of the Cross]], was watched by a large crowd. It was a famous feat of engineering, which made the reputation of Fontana, who detailed it in a book illustrated with copperplate etchings, ''Della Trasportatione dell'Obelisco Vaticano et delle Fabriche di Nostro Signore Papa Sisto V'' (1590),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://purl.pt/6256/1/index.html|title=Della trasportatione dell\u00aaobelisco Vaticano et delle fabriche di Nostro Signore Papa Sisto ...|website=purl.pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchresult.cfm?parent_id=350916&word=|title=Della trasportatione dell'obelisco vaticano et delle fabriche di nostro signore papa Sisto V fatte dal cavallier Domenico Fontana, architetto di Sva Santita, libro primo. \u2013 NYPL Digital Collections|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015}}</ref> which itself set a new standard in communicating technical information and influenced subsequent architectural publications by its meticulous precision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.martayanlan.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi/Books/5/28/25/606|title=Martayan Lan Rare Books|accessdate=21 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521220913/http://www.martayanlan.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi/Books/5/28/25/606|archive-date=21 May 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Before being re-erected the obelisk was exorcised.

Italy agreed in a 1947 UN agreement to return the obelisk but did not affirm its agreement until 1997, after years of pressure and various controversial settlements. In 2003 the Italian government made the first steps toward its return, and in 2008 it was finally re-erected.\n\nThe largest known obelisk, the [[Great Stele]] at [[Axum]], now fallen, at {{convert|33|m}} high and {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} at the base ({{convert|520|MT|ST|disp=or}})<ref>\"The Seventy Wonders of the Ancient World\" edited by Chris scarre 1999</ref> is one of the largest single pieces of stone ever worked in human history (the largest is either at [[Baalbek]] or the [[Ramesseum]]) and probably fell during erection or soon after, destroying a large part of the massive burial chamber underneath it. The obelisks, properly termed [[stela]]e or the native ''[[hawilt]]'' or ''hawilti'' as they do not end in a pyramid, were used to mark graves and underground burial chambers. The largest of the grave markers were for royal burial chambers and were decorated with multi-storey false windows and false doors, while nobility would have smaller less decorated ones.

This was the third attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk; the first two, in 1994 and 1999, ended in failure. There were also two successful attempts to raise a two-ton obelisk and a nine-ton obelisk. Finally in August\u2013September 1999, after learning from their experiences, they were able to erect one successfully.\n\nFirst Hopkins and Rais Abdel Aleem organized an experiment to tow a block of stone weighing about 25 tons. They prepared a path by embedding wooden rails into the ground and placing a sledge on them bearing a megalith weighing about 25 tons. Initially they used more than 100 people to try to tow it but were unable to budge it. Finally, with well over 130 people pulling at once and an additional dozen using levers to prod the sledge forward, they moved it. Over the course of a day, the workers towed it 10 to 20 feet. Despite problems with broken ropes, they proved the monument could be moved this way.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990314.html \"Dispatches\"], NOVA</ref> Additional experiments were done in Egypt and other locations to tow megalithic stone with ancient technologies, some of which are [[List of megalithic sites#List of efforts to move and install stones|listed here]].\n\nOne experiment was to transport a small obelisk on a barge in the Nile River. The barge was built based on ancient Egyptian designs. It had to be very wide to handle the obelisk, with a 2 to 1 ratio length to width, and it was at least twice as long as the obelisk. The obelisk was about {{convert|10|ft|m|order=flip}} long and no more than {{convert|5|MT|ST}}. A barge big enough to transport the largest Egyptian obelisks with this ratio would have had to be close to {{convert|200|ft|m|order=flip|adj=mid|-long}} and {{convert|100|ft|m|order=flip|adj=mid|-wide}}. The workers used ropes that were wrapped around a guide that enabled them to pull away from the river while they were towing it onto the barge. The barge was successfully launched into the Nile.\n\nThe final and successful erection event was organized by Rick Brown, Hopkins, Lehner and Gregg Mullen in a Massachusetts quarry. The preparation work was done with modern technology, but experiments have proven that with enough time and people, it could have been done with ancient technology. To begin, the obelisk was lying on a gravel and stone ramp. A pit in the middle was filled with dry sand. Previous experiments showed that wet sand would not flow as well. The ramp was secured by stone walls. Men raised the obelisk by slowly removing the sand while three crews of men pulled on ropes to control its descent into the pit. The back wall was designed to guide the obelisk into its proper place. The obelisk had to catch a turning groove which would prevent it from sliding. They used brake ropes to prevent it from going too far. Such turning grooves had been found on the ancient pedestals. Gravity did most of the work until the final 15\u00b0 had to be completed by pulling the obelisk forward. They used brake ropes again to make sure it did not fall forward. On 12 September they completed the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990827.html |title=Mysteries of the Nile &#124; August 27, 1999: The Third Attempt |publisher=Pbs.org |date=27 August 1999 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nThis experiment has been used to explain how the obelisks may have been erected in Luxor and other locations.

While ordinary kimono would usually be created by women at home, luxurious silk kimono were designed and created by specialist artists who were usually men.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=24}}\n\nThe Khalili Collection includes some white satin examples patterned with flowers, geometric patterns or emblems such as clouds or waves. These would have been worn as formal dress by samurai women.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=29\u201330}} The military connection is more explicit on a bright red kimono illustrated with {{lang|ja-Latn|gunbai}} [[Japanese war fan|war fans]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=29\u201330}}  Another kind of kimono specific to the military elite is the {{lang|ja-Latn|goshodoki}} or \"palace court style\", which would be worn in the residence of a military leader (a {{lang|ja-Latn|[[Sh\u014dgun|Shogun]]}} or {{lang|ja-Latn|[[daimy\u014d]]}}). These would have landscape scenes, among which there are other motifs usually referencing classic literature. The collection has several examples of this type, often with symbolism referring to stories made popular by [[Noh|Noh plays]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=35\u201344}} Samurai men would dress with a more understated design, exemplified by items in the collection with geometrical designs concentrated around the waist.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=76\u201378}} The {{lang|ja-Latn|yogi}}, or sleeping kimono, is a thickly wadded form of wearable bedding. The Khalili Collection has some examples from samurai families: whereas {{lang|ja-Latn|yogi}} would normally have simple designs, these are especially elaborate and are made of silk rather than the usual [[cotton]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=93\u201395}}\n\nOther items have rich decoration from the waist down only, and family emblems on the neck and shoulders: a style called {{lang|ja-Latn|tsuma moy\u014d}}. These would be worn by women of the merchant class.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=46\u201351}} The kimono of merchant-class women were more subdued than those of the samurai, but still with bold colours and designs representing nature.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=54}} Red was a popular colour for wealthy women, partly because of its cultural association with youth and passion, and partly because the dye{{snd}}derived from [[safflower]]<ref name=\":3\" />{{snd}}was very expensive, so a bright red garment was an ostentatious display of wealth.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=63}} Indian fabrics, brought to Japan by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] importers, were received with enthusiasm and found many uses. The collection includes a flamboyant under-kimono for a man made by combining these finely patterned fabrics with plain-weave silk and cotton.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=80}} Other items show that Japanese designers started printing designs that were influenced by the Indian patterns.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=80\u201384}} Another example in the collection uses fabric imported from Britain or France: ownership of this exotic textile signified wealth and taste, but it was worn as an undergarment where the design would not be seen.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=87}}\n\nWorn by less wealthy merchants, lower down the social scale, are kimono made of cotton or [[ramie]] and dyed with [[indigo dye|indigo]], with less dense designs but still a variety of dyes, patterns and techniques.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=96\u2013102}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX142.jpg|Kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|kosode}}) with a design inspired by the ''[[Eight Views of \u014cmi]]'', 1780\u20131820|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX230.jpg|Underkimono for a man ({{lang|ja-Latn|juban}}) using Indian fabrics, 1800\u20131850|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX154.jpg|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}); landscape scene with bridge, pavilions and thatched huts, 1840\u20131870|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX149.jpg|Summer kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|katabira}}) depicting a landscape with fishing nets, 1820\u20131850|alt=refer to caption\n</gallery>\n\n== Meiji era (1868\u20131912) ==\nThe Meiji era was a period of modernisation and industrialisation, during which Japan opened itself to the world.{{sfn|Guth|2015|pp=106\u2013107}} It saw a rapid introduction of Western culture to Japan, and also of Japanese culture into Europe and America, where kimono became an object of fascination.{{sfn|Iwao|2015|p=9}} The production of kimono started to use Western technologies such as [[Dye|synthetic dye]], and decoration was sometimes influenced by Western motifs.{{sfn|Iwao|2015|p=11}} The textile industry modernised rapidly and silk from Tokyo's factories became Japan's principal export.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=117}} Cheap synthetic dyes meant that bold purples and reds, previously restricted to the wealthy elite, could be owned by anyone.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=118}} Faster and cheaper manufacture allowed more people to afford silk kimono, and enabled designers to create new patterns.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=118}} [[Emperor Meiji|The Emperor]] issued a proclamation promoting Western dress over the allegedly effeminate Japanese dress.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=112}} [[Fukuzawa Yukichi]] journeyed to Europe and the United States and the books he wrote about Western clothing and customs were influential.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=113}} So Western dress became popular in the public sphere: many men adopted Western dress in the workplace, although kimono were still the norm for men at home and for women.{{sfn|Guth|2015|p=110}} In the 1890s the kimono reasserted itself, with people wearing bolder and brighter styles. A new type called the {{lang|ja-Latn|[[h\u014dmongi]]}} bridged the gap between formal dress and everyday dress.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=117}}\n\nThe Khalili Collection has items that illustrate the trends of the Meiji era. Several have a plain, bold colour with elaborate design around the hem.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=126\u2013134}} The technology of the time allowed for subtle [[Color gradient|colour gradients]] rather than abrupt changes of colour. Another trend was for outer and inner garments of the same design.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=126\u2013134}} One trend in the Meiji era was for women's under-kimono made by combining pieces of different fabric, sometimes of radically different colours and designs. The collection has examples of these.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=137}} For men, the trend was for highly decorative under-kimono that would be covered by outer kimono that were plain or very simply designed. Among the Khalili examples, an undergarment depicts performers and dancers among [[haiku]] poems. Another combines postcard-like scenes of Japan's progress with a textual diary of the Meiji era.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=138\u2013141}}\n\nEven the clothing of infants and young children used bold colours, intricate designs, and materials common to adult fashions. The collection has many examples, including a boy's kimono and under-kimono set, decorated with cranes and pine trees, and a girl's set that combines a deep blue outer garment with a bright red undergarment.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=142\u2013144}}\n<gallery>\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX161.jpg|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}) depicting hawks in pine trees, 1870-1900|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX158.jpg|Kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|kosode}}) showing flowers on rafts, 1870-1900|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX195.jpg|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}) depicting hawks, 1880-1900|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono K100.jpg|Outer kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}) with hanging scroll motifs, 1880\u20131890|alt=refer to caption\n</gallery>\n\n== Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods (1912\u20131950) ==\n\nThe early twentieth century brought a new mix on cultural influences, including greater [[Japanese nationalism|nationalism]] and greater Western influence; especially [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|pp=163\u2013164}} The imagery on kimono{{snd}}particularly boys' kimono{{snd}}reflected this, with depictions of skyscrapers, cars or planes to celebrate the modern world.<ref name=\":3\" /> Kimono of these periods are distinguished by vibrant colours and an enormous variety of designs.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=160}} Mass-produced garments used [[Textile printing|printing]] to cheaply imitate traditional dyeing processes.<ref name=\"Atkins\" /> A type of inexpensive, durable, printed silk kimono known as {{lang|ja-Latn|meisen}} became very popular.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=161}} Urban culture of the Taish\u014d period was marked by {{lang|ja-Latn|modanizumu}} (modernism) which celebrated Western art movements and fashion.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=161}} In many aspects of Japanese culture, there was a tension between traditional, orthodox, Japanese influences and modern, Western, subversive influences. The bold new kimono designs were a middle ground that combined aspects from both.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=162}} With the rise of [[Japanese militarism]] in the 1930s, male kimono designs adopted explicitly militaristic imagery, including soldiers, [[bomber]]s and tanks.<ref name=\"Atkins\">{{cite journal|last1=Atkins|first1=Jacqueline M.|title=Omoshirogara Textile Design and Children's Clothing in Japan 1910\u20131930|journal=Textile Society of America Symposium Proceedings.

These inhabit a spectrum from geometric block patterns to floral patterns, with some having floral motifs repeating within a striped or other pattern. These repeating patterns were achieved with stencil printing or by selective dyeing.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|pp=180\u2013201}} As well as stripes and checks, the geometrical patterns used include [[arabesque]]s and [[swastika]]s. One fashion trend of the 1930s, represented in the collection, was for black kimono with abstract patterns in red, yellow, cream and white.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|pp=251\u2013252}}\n\nThe semi-formal, colourfully-decorated {{lang|ja-Latn|h\u014dmongi}} style is represented in the collection,{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|pp=170\u2013171}} as is a formal, black style with decoration limited to below the waist.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=173}} The collection also has examples of modernist kimono whose decoration celebrates modern forms of transport including [[ocean liners]].

The collection has several examples of this type, often with symbolism referring to stories made popular by [[Noh|Noh plays]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=35\u201344}} Samurai men would dress with a more understated design, exemplified by items in the collection with geometrical designs concentrated around the waist.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=76\u201378}} The {{lang|ja-Latn|yogi}}, or sleeping kimono, is a thickly wadded form of wearable bedding. The Khalili Collection has some examples from samurai families: whereas {{lang|ja-Latn|yogi}} would normally have simple designs, these are especially elaborate and are made of silk rather than the usual [[cotton]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=93\u201395}}\n\nOther items have rich decoration from the waist down only, and family emblems on the neck and shoulders: a style called {{lang|ja-Latn|tsuma moy\u014d}}. These would be worn by women of the merchant class.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=46\u201351}} The kimono of merchant-class women were more subdued than those of the samurai, but still with bold colours and designs representing nature.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=54}} Red was a popular colour for wealthy women, partly because of its cultural association with youth and passion, and partly because the dye{{snd}}derived from [[safflower]]<ref name=\":3\" />{{snd}}was very expensive, so a bright red garment was an ostentatious display of wealth.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=63}} Indian fabrics, brought to Japan by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] importers, were received with enthusiasm and found many uses. The collection includes a flamboyant under-kimono for a man made by combining these finely patterned fabrics with plain-weave silk and cotton.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=80}} Other items show that Japanese designers started printing designs that were influenced by the Indian patterns.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=80\u201384}} Another example in the collection uses fabric imported from Britain or France: ownership of this exotic textile signified wealth and taste, but it was worn as an undergarment where the design would not be seen.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=87}}\n\nWorn by less wealthy merchants, lower down the social scale, are kimono made of cotton or [[ramie]] and dyed with [[indigo dye|indigo]], with less dense designs but still a variety of dyes, patterns and techniques.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=96\u2013102}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX142.jpg|Kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|kosode}}) with a design inspired by the ''[[Eight Views of \u014cmi]]'', 1780\u20131820|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX230.jpg|Underkimono for a man ({{lang|ja-Latn|juban}}) using Indian fabrics, 1800\u20131850|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX154.jpg|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}); landscape scene with bridge, pavilions and thatched huts, 1840\u20131870|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX149.jpg|Summer kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|katabira}}) depicting a landscape with fishing nets, 1820\u20131850|alt=refer to caption\n</gallery>\n\n== Meiji era (1868\u20131912) ==\nThe Meiji era was a period of modernisation and industrialisation, during which Japan opened itself to the world.{{sfn|Guth|2015|pp=106\u2013107}} It saw a rapid introduction of Western culture to Japan, and also of Japanese culture into Europe and America, where kimono became an object of fascination.{{sfn|Iwao|2015|p=9}} The production of kimono started to use Western technologies such as [[Dye|synthetic dye]], and decoration was sometimes influenced by Western motifs.{{sfn|Iwao|2015|p=11}} The textile industry modernised rapidly and silk from Tokyo's factories became Japan's principal export.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=117}} Cheap synthetic dyes meant that bold purples and reds, previously restricted to the wealthy elite, could be owned by anyone.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=118}} Faster and cheaper manufacture allowed more people to afford silk kimono, and enabled designers to create new patterns.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=118}} [[Emperor Meiji|The Emperor]] issued a proclamation promoting Western dress over the allegedly effeminate Japanese dress.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=112}} [[Fukuzawa Yukichi]] journeyed to Europe and the United States and the books he wrote about Western clothing and customs were influential.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=113}} So Western dress became popular in the public sphere: many men adopted Western dress in the workplace, although kimono were still the norm for men at home and for women.{{sfn|Guth|2015|p=110}} In the 1890s the kimono reasserted itself, with people wearing bolder and brighter styles. A new type called the {{lang|ja-Latn|[[h\u014dmongi]]}} bridged the gap between formal dress and everyday dress.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=117}}\n\nThe Khalili Collection has items that illustrate the trends of the Meiji era. Several have a plain, bold colour with elaborate design around the hem.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=126\u2013134}} The technology of the time allowed for subtle [[Color gradient|colour gradients]] rather than abrupt changes of colour. Another trend was for outer and inner garments of the same design.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=126\u2013134}} One trend in the Meiji era was for women's under-kimono made by combining pieces of different fabric, sometimes of radically different colours and designs. The collection has examples of these.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=137}} For men, the trend was for highly decorative under-kimono that would be covered by outer kimono that were plain or very simply designed. Among the Khalili examples, an undergarment depicts performers and dancers among [[haiku]] poems. Another combines postcard-like scenes of Japan's progress with a textual diary of the Meiji era.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=138\u2013141}}\n\nEven the clothing of infants and young children used bold colours, intricate designs, and materials common to adult fashions. The collection has many examples, including a boy's kimono and under-kimono set, decorated with cranes and pine trees, and a girl's set that combines a deep blue outer garment with a bright red undergarment.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=142\u2013144}}\n<gallery>\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX161.jpg|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}) depicting hawks in pine trees, 1870-1900|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX158.jpg|Kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|kosode}}) showing flowers on rafts, 1870-1900|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX195.jpg|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}) depicting hawks, 1880-1900|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono K100.jpg|Outer kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}) with hanging scroll motifs, 1880\u20131890|alt=refer to caption\n</gallery>\n\n== Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods (1912\u20131950) ==\n\nThe early twentieth century brought a new mix on cultural influences, including greater [[Japanese nationalism|nationalism]] and greater Western influence; especially [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|pp=163\u2013164}} The imagery on kimono{{snd}}particularly boys' kimono{{snd}}reflected this, with depictions of skyscrapers, cars or planes to celebrate the modern world.<ref name=\":3\" /> Kimono of these periods are distinguished by vibrant colours and an enormous variety of designs.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=160}} Mass-produced garments used [[Textile printing|printing]] to cheaply imitate traditional dyeing processes.<ref name=\"Atkins\" /> A type of inexpensive, durable, printed silk kimono known as {{lang|ja-Latn|meisen}} became very popular.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=161}} Urban culture of the Taish\u014d period was marked by {{lang|ja-Latn|modanizumu}} (modernism) which celebrated Western art movements and fashion.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=161}} In many aspects of Japanese culture, there was a tension between traditional, orthodox, Japanese influences and modern, Western, subversive influences.

Written by Affleck and Damon, the film follows 20-year-old [[South Boston]] janitor Will Hunting, an unrecognized genius who, as part of a [[deferred prosecution]] agreement after assaulting a police officer, becomes a client of a therapist and studies advanced mathematics with a renowned professor. Through his therapy sessions, Will re-evaluates his relationships with his best friend, his girlfriend, and himself, facing the significant task of confronting his past and thinking about his future.\n\nThe film grossed over $225 million during its theatrical run, from a $10 million budget. For the [[70th Academy Awards|1998 Oscars]] it was nominated for nine [[Academy Awards]], including the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], and won two: [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Williams and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] for Affleck and Damon.\n\nIn 2014, it was ranked at number 53 in ''The Hollywood Reporter''{{'}}s \"100 Favorite Films\" list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/person/good-will-hunting|title=Best Hollywood Movies of All Time - Hollywood Reporter|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nTwenty-year-old Will Hunting ([[Matt Damon]]) of [[South Boston]] is a self-taught genius, though he works as a janitor at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and spends his free time drinking with his friends, Chuckie, Billy, and Morgan. When Professor Gerald Lambeau posts a difficult mathematics problem on a blackboard as a challenge for his graduate students, Will solves the problem anonymously, stunning both the students and Lambeau. As a challenge to the unknown genius, Lambeau posts an even more difficult problem. Will flees when Lambeau catches him writing the solution on the blackboard late at night. At a bar, Will meets Skylar ([[Minnie Driver]]), a British woman about to graduate from [[Harvard College]], who plans on attending medical school at [[Stanford University School of Medicine|Stanford]].\n\nThe next day, Will and his friends fight a gang who used to bully Will as a child. Will is arrested after he attacks a responding police officer. Lambeau sits in on his court appearance and watches Will defend himself. He arranges for him to forgo jail time if he agrees to study mathematics under Lambeau's supervision and participate in therapy sessions. Will tentatively agrees, but treats his therapists with mockery. In desperation, Lambeau calls on Dr. Sean Maguire, his college roommate, who now teaches psychology at [[Bunker Hill Community College]]. Unlike other therapists, Sean actually challenges Will's [[defense mechanism]]s, and after the first session where Sean threatens Will after he insults his deceased wife and a few unproductive sessions, Will begins to open up.\n\nWill is particularly struck by Sean's story of how he met his wife by giving up his ticket to the historic game six of the [[1975 World Series]], after falling in love at first sight. Sean does not regret his decision, even though his wife died of cancer. This encourages Will to build a relationship with Skylar, though he lies to her about his past and is reluctant to introduce her to his friends or show her his rundown neighborhood. Will also challenges Sean to take an objective look at his own life, since Sean cannot move on from his wife's death.\n\nLambeau sets up a number of job interviews for Will, but Will scorns them by sending Chuckie as his \"chief negotiator\", and by turning down a position at the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] with a scathing critique of the agency's moral position. Skylar asks Will to move to California with her, but he refuses and tells her he is an orphan, and that his foster father physically abused him. Will breaks up with Skylar and later storms out on Lambeau, dismissing the mathematical research he has been doing. Sean points out that Will is so adept at anticipating future failure in his interpersonal relationships that he deliberately sabotages them in order to avoid emotional pain. Chuckie likewise challenges Will over his resistance to taking any of the positions he interviews for, telling Will he owes it to his friends to make the most of opportunities they will never have, even if it means leaving one day without looking back. He then tells Will that the best part of his day is a brief moment when he waits on his doorstep thinking Will has moved on to something greater.\n\nWill walks in on a heated argument between Sean and Lambeau over his potential. Sean and Will share and find out that they were both victims of child abuse. Sean helps Will to see that he is a victim of his own inner demons and to accept that it is not his fault, causing him to break down in tears. Will accepts one of the job offers arranged by Lambeau. Having helped Will overcome his problems, Sean reconciles with Lambeau and decides to take a sabbatical. Will's friends present him with a rebuilt [[Chevrolet Nova]] for his 21st birthday. Later, Chuckie goes to Will's house to pick him up, only to find that he is not there, much to his happiness.

Written by Affleck and Damon, the film follows 20-year-old [[South Boston]] janitor Will Hunting, an unrecognized genius who, as part of a [[deferred prosecution]] agreement after assaulting a police officer, becomes a client of a therapist and studies advanced mathematics with a renowned professor. Through his therapy sessions, Will re-evaluates his relationships with his best friend, his girlfriend, and himself, facing the significant task of confronting his past and thinking about his future.\n\nThe film grossed over $225 million during its theatrical run, from a $10 million budget. For the [[70th Academy Awards|1998 Oscars]] it was nominated for nine [[Academy Awards]], including the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], and won two: [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Williams and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] for Affleck and Damon.\n\nIn 2014, it was ranked at number 53 in ''The Hollywood Reporter''{{'}}s \"100 Favorite Films\" list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/person/good-will-hunting|title=Best Hollywood Movies of All Time - Hollywood Reporter|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nTwenty-year-old Will Hunting ([[Matt Damon]]) of [[South Boston]] is a self-taught genius, though he works as a janitor at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and spends his free time drinking with his friends, Chuckie, Billy, and Morgan. When Professor Gerald Lambeau posts a difficult mathematics problem on a blackboard as a challenge for his graduate students, Will solves the problem anonymously, stunning both the students and Lambeau. As a challenge to the unknown genius, Lambeau posts an even more difficult problem. Will flees when Lambeau catches him writing the solution on the blackboard late at night. At a bar, Will meets Skylar ([[Minnie Driver]]), a British woman about to graduate from [[Harvard College]], who plans on attending medical school at [[Stanford University School of Medicine|Stanford]].\n\nThe next day, Will and his friends fight a gang who used to bully Will as a child. Will is arrested after he attacks a responding police officer. Lambeau sits in on his court appearance and watches Will defend himself. He arranges for him to forgo jail time if he agrees to study mathematics under Lambeau's supervision and participate in therapy sessions. Will tentatively agrees, but treats his therapists with mockery. In desperation, Lambeau calls on Dr. Sean Maguire, his college roommate, who now teaches psychology at [[Bunker Hill Community College]]. Unlike other therapists, Sean actually challenges Will's [[defense mechanism]]s, and after the first session where Sean threatens Will after he insults his deceased wife and a few unproductive sessions, Will begins to open up.\n\nWill is particularly struck by Sean's story of how he met his wife by giving up his ticket to the historic game six of the [[1975 World Series]], after falling in love at first sight. Sean does not regret his decision, even though his wife died of cancer. This encourages Will to build a relationship with Skylar, though he lies to her about his past and is reluctant to introduce her to his friends or show her his rundown neighborhood. Will also challenges Sean to take an objective look at his own life, since Sean cannot move on from his wife's death.\n\nLambeau sets up a number of job interviews for Will, but Will scorns them by sending Chuckie as his \"chief negotiator\", and by turning down a position at the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] with a scathing critique of the agency's moral position. Skylar asks Will to move to California with her, but he refuses and tells her he is an orphan, and that his foster father physically abused him. Will breaks up with Skylar and later storms out on Lambeau, dismissing the mathematical research he has been doing. Sean points out that Will is so adept at anticipating future failure in his interpersonal relationships that he deliberately sabotages them in order to avoid emotional pain. Chuckie likewise challenges Will over his resistance to taking any of the positions he interviews for, telling Will he owes it to his friends to make the most of opportunities they will never have, even if it means leaving one day without looking back. He then tells Will that the best part of his day is a brief moment when he waits on his doorstep thinking Will has moved on to something greater.\n\nWill walks in on a heated argument between Sean and Lambeau over his potential. Sean and Will share and find out that they were both victims of child abuse. Sean helps Will to see that he is a victim of his own inner demons and to accept that it is not his fault, causing him to break down in tears. Will accepts one of the job offers arranged by Lambeau. Having helped Will overcome his problems, Sean reconciles with Lambeau and decides to take a sabbatical. Will's friends present him with a rebuilt [[Chevrolet Nova]] for his 21st birthday. Later, Chuckie goes to Will's house to pick him up, only to find that he is not there, much to his happiness. Will sends Sean a letter telling him to tell Lambeau that he had to go \"see about a girl\", revealing he passed on the job offer and instead is heading to California to reunite with Skylar.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Will Hunting\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Dr. Sean Maguire\n* [[Ben Affleck]] as Chuckie Sullivan\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Professor Gerald Lambeau\n* [[Minnie Driver]] as Skylar\n* [[Casey Affleck]] as Morgan O'Mally\n* [[Cole Hauser]] as Billy McBride\n* [[John Mighton]] as Tom\n* [[Scott William Winters]] as Clark\n* [[Jimmy Flynn]] as Judge George H.

As a last resort, Affleck passed the script to his ''Chasing Amy'' director Kevin Smith, who read it and promised to walk the script directly into [[Harvey Weinstein]]'s office at Miramax. Weinstein read the script, loved it, and paid Castle Rock their due, while also agreeing to let Damon and Affleck star in the film. In his recollection of the meeting, Weinstein asked about an out-of-place, mid-script [[oral sex]] scene, which Damon and Affleck explained was a test to see which studio executives had actually read the script.<ref>{{Cite AV media|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=623Es9ZYmt8&t=25s|title = Harvey Weinstein - The Graham Norton Show|date = Mar 15, 2015 |accessdate = |website = |publisher = BBC America|via= [[YouTube]] |last = |first = }}</ref><ref name=\"boston\" />\n[[File:Dunkin' Donuts, Cambridge, MA.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Baskin-Robbins]]/[[Dunkin' Donuts]], in front of which Will mocked Harvard student Clark (as seen in 2013; as of 2019, it is a ramen restaurant).]]\nAfter buying the rights from Castle Rock, Miramax put the film into production. Several well-known filmmakers were originally considered to direct, including [[Mel Gibson]], [[Michael Mann]], and [[Steven Soderbergh]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Originally, Affleck asked Kevin Smith whether he was interested in directing. He declined, saying they needed a \"good director\" and that he only directs things he writes and is not much of a visual director, but still served as one of the film's executive producers. Damon and Affleck later chose [[Gus Van Sant]] for the job, whose work on previous films like ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]]'' (1989) had left a favorable impression on the fledgling screenwriters.

Although the story is set in Boston, and many of the scenes were done on location in the Greater Boston area, much of the interior shots were filmed at locations in Toronto, with the [[University of Toronto]] standing in for [[MIT]] and [[Harvard University]]. The classroom scenes were filmed at McLennan Physical Laboratories (of the University of Toronto) and [[Central Technical School]].

Glashow referred Damon to her brother-in-law, [[Daniel Kleitman]], a mathematics professor at MIT. In the spring of 1997, Damon and Affleck asked Kleitman to \"speak math to us\" for writing realistic dialogue, so Kleitman invited postdoc [[Tom Bohman]] to join him giving them a \"quick lecture\". When asked for a problem that Will could solve, Kleitman and Bohman suggested the unsolved computer science [[P versus NP problem]], but the movie used other problems. [[Columbia University]]'s physics and math professor [[Brian Greene]] at the [[Tribeca Film Festival|Tribeca]] [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation|Sloan]] retrospective explained that for physics, \"Having some deep insight about the universe [\u2060\u200a\u2060.\u2060\u200a\u2060.\u2060\u200a\u2060.\u2060\u200a\u2060] typically [\u2060\u200a\u2060is\u200a\u2060] a group project in the modern era,\" while \"doing some mathematical theorem is a singular undertaking very often.\"<ref name=\"bi\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/good-will-hunting-matt-damon-harvard-professor-helped-change-movie-2015-4|title=One of Matt Damon's Harvard professors gave him a small note that completely changed 'Good Will Hunting'|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-05-10}}</ref><ref name=\"mit\">{{Cite news|url=https://alum.mit.edu/slice/how-mit-professor-helped-good-will-hunting-get-math-right-and-landed-tiny-role-film|title=How an MIT Professor Helped Good Will Hunting Get the Math Right\u2014and Landed a Tiny Role in the Film|access-date=2018-05-10|last=London|first=Jay|work=MIT Alumni - Slice of MIT }}</ref>\n\nPatrick O'Donnell, professor of physics at [[University of Toronto]], served as mathematical consultant for the film production.<ref>O'Donnell relied on ''Graph Theory and Theoretical Physics'' by [[Frank Harary]] where at page 63 P.W. Kasteleyn wrote on \"Graph theory and crystal physics\".</ref>\n\nThe main hallway blackboard is used twice to reveal Will Hunting's talent, first to the audience, second to Professor Lambeau. Matt Damon based it on his artist brother Kyle visiting MIT's [[Infinite Corridor]] and writing \"an incredibly elaborate, totally fake, version of an equation\" on a blackboard which lasted for months. Kyle returned to Matt saying MIT needed these blackboards \"because these kids are so smart they just need to, you know, drop everything and solve problems!\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.mit.edu/2016/matt-damon-commencement-address-0603|title=Matt Damon's Commencement address|work=MIT News|access-date=2018-05-11}}</ref>\n\nThe first turning point in the plot occurs when Will sets aside his mop in a hallway and studies a difficult blackboard [[graph theory]] problem posed by Professor Lambeau.<ref>[[Burkard Polster]] & Marty Ross (2012) ''Math goes to the Movies'', [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], page 9, {{ISBN|1-4214-0483-4}}</ref> The question is to find the number of 3-step [[walk (graph theory)|walks]] in a given graph.
