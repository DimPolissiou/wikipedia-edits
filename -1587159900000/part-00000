Planning started during the 1980s to remove this section that was regularly snowed down, and at the same time reduce the length and increase the speed of the railway. Construction started in 1990, and it was opened by [[Harald V of Norway|King Harald V]] on 16 May 1993. Following the construction of the tunnel, {{convert|32|km|mi}} of railway around this area was also rebuilt to achieve higher train speeds, a shorter overall distance, and to maximize the natural protection from the weather.  This was built in five stages, opening between 1995 and 1998.\n\n==History==\n{{main|Bergen Line}}\nWhen the Bergen Line opened in 1909, it was the first railway to connect Eastern and Western Norway. The railway had faced many engineering challenges during construction, and after it opened, winter proved to be a fierce enemy to holding the railway open. Especially the parts around [[Finse]] proved extremely difficult to manage. Despite the use of single-locomotive [[rotary snowplow]]s running continually through the day, the track was snowed out frequently, and on a few occasions days passed before the track could be cleared.\n\n===Launch of an idea===\n[[File:Bergensbanen finse.jpg|thumb|Part of the now abandoned part of the Bergen Line that was replaced by the Finse Tunnel]]\nTo solve this challenge, the [[Norwegian State Railways]] (NSB) had built snow sheds along the track, especially on the section between [[Finse Station]] and [[Hallingskeid Station]].  Of the {{convert|20.7|km|mi|adj=on}} line between the two stations, {{convert|10.5|km|mi}} was under snow sheds and {{convert|2.5|km|mi}} was in tunnel. Along this part of the line was the highest point of the railways, {{convert|1301.7|m|ft}} at a point named [[Taugevatn]].<ref name=rodland>{{cite book |first=Kjartan |last=R\u00f8dland |authorlink=Kjartan R\u00f8dland |title=Bergensbanen |publisher=Alma Mater |year=1999 |location=Bergen |language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1980s, the repeated operational breaks and high costs related to the Bergen Line past Finse was a constant problem for NSB and in 1983 the director, [[Robert Nord\u00e9n]] launched the idea of a tunnel through the mountain. He was backed by the engineering staff in NSB, who felt that a tunnel would be a simple way of solving many of the challenges relating to the railway operations. Estimates calculated the cost of the investment at {{NOK|170 million}}, including the upgrade of part of the line east of Finse Station. In addition to the argument for better regularity on the Bergen Line, NSB pointed out that the cost structure of railway operations had changed, making it relatively more expensive to operate snow sheds, that required rebuilding about every twenty years, than to build a tunnel, that would be excavated using heavy and automated machinery. NSB launched the idea to start construction after [[Oslo Central Station]] was scheduled for completion in 1989.<ref name=rodland />\n\nIt was decided to build the new line on the east side of Finse that would both permit higher speeds\u2014allowing through speeds of {{convert|170|km/h|mph}}\u2014and at the same time move the line to a more protected right-of-way, to take advantage of natural protection against the weather. In total the two proposals would mean that {{convert|32|km|mi}} of railway would be rebuilt. The higher speed limit was seen as part of a long-term plan to shorten down travel time on the Bergen Line\u2014a plan that would include shortening the line with [[Ringerike Line]] from [[H\u00f8nefoss Station|H\u00f8nefoss]] to [[Sandvika Station|Sandvika]], as well as gradual upgrades of the line.<ref name=rodland />\n\nThe plans were taken up to political level in 1987, when they were launched by the [[Standing Committee on Transport and Communications]] of the [[Parliament of Norway|Norwegian Parliament]]. Due to the possibility of covering the investment costs through savings on operations, the committee asked the [[Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications]] to prioritize the tunnel on their budget proposals. At the political level, the Finse Tunnel had to compete with upgrades in [[Eastern Norway]], where NSB was planning to launch the [[NSB InterCity Express|InterCity Express]] service.<ref name=rodland /> The government chose to try to delay the decision to build the Finse Tunnel until after 1990 so it could be considered along with other railway projects in a central plan. Calculations showed a [[benefit-cost ratio]] of 1.93, making it a highly profitable venture for the government. The Minister of Transport and Communications, [[Kjell Borgen]], wanted to give priority to the new line from [[Ski Station|Ski]] to [[Moss Station|Moss]].
