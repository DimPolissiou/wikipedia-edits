Thani]], [[Surat Thani Province]], southern [[Thailand]]. It lies 651 km south of Bangkok. It is the capital of [[Surat Thani Province]]. The city has a population of 132,040 (2019), and an area of 68.97 square kilometers. The city's population density is 1,914 inhabitants per km\u00b2. \n\nSurat Thani is near the mouth of the [[Tapi River, Thailand|Tapi River]] on the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. The city offers no major tourist attractions in itself, and is mainly known to tourists as the jumping-off point to [[Ko Samui]], [[Ko Tao]], and [[Ko Pha Ngan]]. It is the regional commercial center, with a seaport dealing in the main products of the province, rubber and coconuts.\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe city received its name, which means \"city of good people\", by King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI) in 1915. The name was given to the city due to the intense devotion of the locals to [[Buddhism]]. Previously the city was known as '''Bandon''' ({{lang-th|\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e14\u0e2d\u0e19}}), meaning \"village on higher ground\". The name of the city is taken from the [[India]]n city [[Surat]] in [[Gujarat]] on the Indian River Tapi. King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI) gave this name to his city as he was impressed with the Indian city.\n\n==History==\nOn 21 December 1930 Surat Thani became a sanitary district (''[[sukhaphiban]]''),<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=47|issue=\u0e01|pages=271\u2013273|script-title=th:\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e23\u0e21\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e42\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23 \u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e01\u0e32\u0e28 \u0e43\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e1a\u0e31\u0e0d\u0e0d\u0e31\u0e15\u0e34\u0e08\u0e31\u0e14\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e02\u0e32\u0e20\u0e34\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25 \u0e08\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35 \u0e21\u0e13\u0e11\u0e25\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23\u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2473/A/271.PDF|format=PDF|date=December 21, 1930|language=Thai}}</ref> which was upgraded to a town (''[[thesaban mueang]]'') on 7 December 1935, with a municipal area of 2.67&nbsp;km\u00b2.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=51|issue=\u0e01|pages=1758\u20131762|script-title=th:\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e01\u0e24\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e35\u0e01\u0e32\u0e08\u0e31\u0e14\u0e15\u0e31\u0e49\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35 \u0e08\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35 \u0e1e\u0e38\u0e17\u0e18\u0e28\u0e31\u0e01\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a \u0e52\u0e54\u0e57\u0e58|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2478/A/1758.PDF|format=PDF|date=December 10, 1935|language=Thai}}</ref> The area of the municipality was enlarged to 6.95&nbsp;km\u00b2 on 14 October 1958,<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=75|issue=79 \u0e01|pages=555\u2013558|script-title=th:\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e01\u0e24\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e35\u0e01\u0e32\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e35\u0e48\u0e22\u0e19\u0e41\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e07\u0e40\u0e02\u0e15\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35 \u0e08\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35 \u0e1e.\u0e28. \u0e52\u0e55\u0e50\u0e51|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2501/A/079/555.PDF|format=PDF|date=October 14, 1958|language=Thai}}</ref> and on 22 December 1994 it was further enlarged to 68.97&nbsp;km\u00b2.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=111|issue=59 \u0e01|pages=29\u201332|script-title=th:\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e01\u0e24\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e35\u0e01\u0e32\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e35\u0e48\u0e22\u0e19\u0e41\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e07\u0e40\u0e02\u0e15\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35 \u0e08\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35 (\u0e09\u0e1a\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48 \u0e52) \u0e1e.\u0e28. \u0e52\u0e55\u0e53\u0e57|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2537/A/059/29.PDF\n|format=PDF|date=December 21, 1994|language=Thai}}</ref> On 4 May 2007, the town was upgraded to city status (''[[thesaban nakhon]]'').<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=124|issue=Special<!--\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e40\u0e28\u0e29--> 67 \u0e07|pages=15|script-title=th:\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e01\u0e32\u0e28\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e23\u0e27\u0e07\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e14\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 \u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07 \u0e40\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e35\u0e48\u0e22\u0e19\u0e41\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e07\u0e10\u0e32\u0e19\u0e30\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35 \u0e2d\u0e33\u0e40\u0e20\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35 \u0e08\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35 \u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2550/E/067/15.PDF|format=PDF|date=June 4, 2007|language=Thai}}</ref>\n\nSince 1969 Surat Thani is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Diocese of Surat Thani]], responsible for about 6,000 Catholics in southern Thailand.\n\n==Transportation==\n===Rail===\nSurat Thani is connected with [[Bangkok]] by the [[State Railway of Thailand#Southern Line|Southern Line]] of the [[State Railway of Thailand]].

It lies 651 km south of Bangkok. It is the capital of [[Surat Thani Province]]. The city has a population of 132,040 (2019), and an area of 68.97 square kilometers. The city's population density is 1,914 inhabitants per km\u00b2. \n\nSurat Thani is near the mouth of the [[Tapi River, Thailand|Tapi River]] on the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. The city offers no major tourist attractions in itself, and is mainly known to tourists as the jumping-off point to [[Ko Samui]], [[Ko Tao]], and [[Ko Pha Ngan]]. It is the regional commercial center, with a seaport dealing in the main products of the province, rubber and coconuts.\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe city received its name, which means \"city of good people\", by King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI) in 1915. The name was given to the city due to the intense devotion of the locals to [[Buddhism]].

It also debated establishing a provincial party. ''De facto'' party leader [[R\u00e9al Caouette]] opposed the creation of a provincial party, and convinced delegates to accept the creation of a ten-member committee to study the proposal instead. Caouette argued that the creditistes had no organization and no money to create a provincial party. Furthermore, the social credit proposal for reform of the monetary system could only be implemented at the federal level<ref>Dufresne, op.cit. 2 September 1963</ref> (as the [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit]] government of [[William Aberhart]] in [[Alberta]] had learned when it tried to issue \u201c[[prosperity certificates]]\u201d).

All four candidates, who appeared on the ballot as \"unaffiliated\" candidates (\"sans d\u00e9signation\"), were defeated, finishing in second place behind the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] candidates.

[[Gaston Tremblay]], a [[Parti nationaliste chr\u00e9tien|Christian Nationalist]] Member of the [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] (MNA) (elected as a Union Nationale member in 1966) became the first Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste MNA late in 1969.<ref>{{QuebecMNAbio|tremblay-gaston-5595|text=National Assembly biography of Gaston Tremblay}}</ref> The party was officially founded on January 25, 1970.  [[Camil Samson]], the new party's president, was elected as leader of the party on March 22, 1970.\n\n==1970 election==\n\nIn the [[1970 Quebec general election|April 29, 1970 elections]], the cr\u00e9ditistes benefited from the decline of the conservative Union Nationale party and made a modest breakthrough, winning 12 seats in the National Assembly and 11.2% of the vote.  The party was never able to build on this initial success because it was wracked continually by internal divisions.\n\nOn February 13, 1972, faced by challenges from within his party, Camil Samson resigned as leader, and a leadership convention was planned for March 18\u201319, 1972: [[Armand Bois]] (MNA for Saint-Sauveur) was chosen interim leader on February 21.\n\nOn March 16, Camil Samson was expelled from the party by nine of the cr\u00e9ditiste MNAs (organized by Armand Bois) for criticizing some of the caucus members, and for not attending party meetings.  On March 19, Samson declared himself to be the leader of a new cr\u00e9ditiste group, and demanded to be seated in the National Assembly as a member of the \"Registered Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste du Qu\u00e9bec\"', along with two other cr\u00e9ditiste MNAs, [[Aur\u00e8le Audet]] ([[Abitibi-Ouest (provincial electoral district)|Abitibi-Ouest]]) and [[Bernard Dumont]] ([[M\u00e9gantic (provincial electoral district)|M\u00e9gantic]]).  However, the speaker of the National Assembly recognized Armand Bois as parliamentary leader of the party.  On August 11, Samson, Dumont and Audet rejoined the \"Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste du Qu\u00e9bec\".\n\nOn February 4, 1973, [[Yvon Dupuis]] was elected leader of the Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste du Qu\u00e9bec over Samson. The party was renamed the '''Parti cr\u00e9ditiste'''. Samson was named leader in the National Assembly.  On February 21, Armand Bois, the former interim leader, was expelled from the party for saying at the February 4 leadership convention that Yvon Dupuis's entourage included members of the [[Montreal]] underworld.  Bois sat as an independent cr\u00e9ditiste until October 3, when he apologized for his statements and asked to be readmitted to the party.\n\nDupuis failed to win a by-election to enter the National Assembly, and was pressured to quit the leadership of the party. On May 5, 1974, Dupuis resigned as leader of the Parti cr\u00e9ditiste, and formed the '''[[Parti pr\u00e9sidentiel]]'''. Dupuis resigned as leader of that party on October 21, 1974, and ended his political career. The Parti pr\u00e9sidentiel was merged into the Union Nationale a year later.\n\n==1973 election==\n\nIn the [[1973 Quebec general election|October 29, 1973 election]], after campaigning under the name '''Parti cr\u00e9ditiste''', only two party members won election to the National Assembly, [[Fabien Roy]] and [[Camil Samson]], although the party won 9.9% of the popular vote.\n\nOn December 1, 1974, Armand Bois announced the foundation of a new cr\u00e9ditiste party, the '''Parti r\u00e9formateur'''.  That party merged with the Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste on November 18, 1975.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bernard |first=Andr\u00e9 |title=Qu\u00e9bec : \u00e9lections 1976 |year=1976 |publisher=Hurtubise HMH |location=Montreal |language=French |isbn=0-7758-0099-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/quebecelections10000bern_t9p5/page/124 124] |url=https://archive.org/details/quebecelections10000bern_t9p5/page/124 }}</ref>\n\nBefore the 1976 election, there was a further split as the only two sitting Parti cr\u00e9ditiste MNAs went their separate ways.  [[Camil Samson]] became leader of the party, again called the Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste du Qu\u00e9bec, on May 11, 1975.  [[Fabien Roy]] was expelled from the party. It is not clear whether Roy was expelled on January 15, 1974 or November 3, 1975.\n\nOn December 14, 1975, Roy teamed up with former Liberal [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Choquette]] to form the '''[[Parti national populaire]]''' under Choquette's leadership. The PNP and the Union Nationale, led by [[Rodrigue Biron]], announced the merger of their two parties, but the idea was abandoned by the Union Nationale one month later.\n\n==1976 election==\n\nIn the November 15, [[1976 Quebec general election|1976 general election]], Camil Samson was the only cr\u00e9ditiste elected, although the party won 4.63% of the popular vote across the province. (The PNP's Roy also won his seat, while Choquette was defeated.)\n\nSamson's strong oratorical ability and sense of humour pleased the crowds who attended his rallies, and the party spent $150,000 on 15-minute television advertisements that aired almost every day\",<ref name=\"Montreal Gazette 1976, p. 13\">Montreal Gazette, 13 November 1976, p. 13, \u201cSamson\u2019s star on the wane\u201d.</ref> but his inability to get along with his colleagues had decimated Creditiste ranks over the years, and left the party largely composed of his own supporters who had followed him \u201cthrough thick and thin\u201d.<ref name=\"Montreal Gazette 1976, p. 13\"/>  Samson promised interest-free loans and a [[guaranteed annual income]],<ref name=\"Montreal Gazette 1976, p. 13\"/> and emphasised traditional social credit themes including the rejection of socialism and the plight of the common man.\u201d<ref>Montreal Gazette, 8 November 1976, p. 10, \u201cSamson\u2019s strength is in his delivery\u201d.</ref>\n\nSome traditional Creditistes such as Carl O\u2019Malley had followed Fabien Roy into the Parti Nationale Populaire (O\u2019Malley was the PNP candidate in [[Notre-Dame-de-Grace (provincial electoral district)|Notre-Dame-de-Grace]] riding)<ref>Montreal Gazette, 11 November 1976, p. 10.</ref> even through the PNP did not embrace social credit.\n\nSamson was re-elected with 9011 votes (40%) in his riding of [[Rouyn-Noranda (provincial electoral district)|Rouyn-Noranda]].\n\n==Dissolution==\n\nThe Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste du Qu\u00e9bec was dissolved as Camil Samson founded a new party, '''[[Les D\u00e9mocrates]]''', on November 12, 1978.<ref name=\"quebecpolitique.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.quebecpolitique.com/partis/cs.html |title= Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste |accessdate=2006-11-13 | work = Qu\u00e9becPolitique.com |language = French}}</ref> Samson\u2019s partner in establishing the new party was [[Pierre S\u00e9vigny]], a federal cabinet minister in the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] government of [[John Diefenbaker]].

On August 11, Samson, Dumont and Audet rejoined the \"Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste du Qu\u00e9bec\".\n\nOn February 4, 1973, [[Yvon Dupuis]] was elected leader of the Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste du Qu\u00e9bec over Samson. The party was renamed the '''Parti cr\u00e9ditiste'''. Samson was named leader in the National Assembly.  On February 21, Armand Bois, the former interim leader, was expelled from the party for saying at the February 4 leadership convention that Yvon Dupuis's entourage included members of the [[Montreal]] underworld.  Bois sat as an independent cr\u00e9ditiste until October 3, when he apologized for his statements and asked to be readmitted to the party.\n\nDupuis failed to win a by-election to enter the National Assembly, and was pressured to quit the leadership of the party. On May 5, 1974, Dupuis resigned as leader of the Parti cr\u00e9ditiste, and formed the '''[[Parti pr\u00e9sidentiel]]'''. Dupuis resigned as leader of that party on October 21, 1974, and ended his political career. The Parti pr\u00e9sidentiel was merged into the Union Nationale a year later.\n\n==1973 election==\n\nIn the [[1973 Quebec general election|October 29, 1973 election]], after campaigning under the name '''Parti cr\u00e9ditiste''', only two party members won election to the National Assembly, [[Fabien Roy]] and [[Camil Samson]], although the party won 9.9% of the popular vote.\n\nOn December 1, 1974, Armand Bois announced the foundation of a new cr\u00e9ditiste party, the '''Parti r\u00e9formateur'''.  That party merged with the Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste on November 18, 1975.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bernard |first=Andr\u00e9 |title=Qu\u00e9bec : \u00e9lections 1976 |year=1976 |publisher=Hurtubise HMH |location=Montreal |language=French |isbn=0-7758-0099-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/quebecelections10000bern_t9p5/page/124 124] |url=https://archive.org/details/quebecelections10000bern_t9p5/page/124 }}</ref>\n\nBefore the 1976 election, there was a further split as the only two sitting Parti cr\u00e9ditiste MNAs went their separate ways.  [[Camil Samson]] became leader of the party, again called the Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste du Qu\u00e9bec, on May 11, 1975.  [[Fabien Roy]] was expelled from the party. It is not clear whether Roy was expelled on January 15, 1974 or November 3, 1975.\n\nOn December 14, 1975, Roy teamed up with former Liberal [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Choquette]] to form the '''[[Parti national populaire]]''' under Choquette's leadership. The PNP and the Union Nationale, led by [[Rodrigue Biron]], announced the merger of their two parties, but the idea was abandoned by the Union Nationale one month later.\n\n==1976 election==\n\nIn the November 15, [[1976 Quebec general election|1976 general election]], Camil Samson was the only cr\u00e9ditiste elected, although the party won 4.63% of the popular vote across the province. (The PNP's Roy also won his seat, while Choquette was defeated.)\n\nSamson's strong oratorical ability and sense of humour pleased the crowds who attended his rallies, and the party spent $150,000 on 15-minute television advertisements that aired almost every day\",<ref name=\"Montreal Gazette 1976, p. 13\">Montreal Gazette, 13 November 1976, p. 13, \u201cSamson\u2019s star on the wane\u201d.</ref> but his inability to get along with his colleagues had decimated Creditiste ranks over the years, and left the party largely composed of his own supporters who had followed him \u201cthough thick and thin\u201d.<ref name=\"Montreal Gazette 1976, p. 13\"/>  Samson promised interest-free loans and a [[guaranteed annual income]],<ref name=\"Montreal Gazette 1976, p. 13\"/> and emphasised traditional social credit themes including the rejection of socialism and the plight of the common man.\u201d<ref>Montreal Gazette, 8 November 1976, p. 10, \u201cSamson\u2019s strength is in his delivery\u201d.</ref>\n\nSome traditional Creditistes such as Carl O\u2019Malley had followed Fabien Roy into the Parti Nationale Populaire (O\u2019Malley was the PNP candidate in [[Notre-Dame-de-Grace (provincial electoral district)|Notre-Dame-de-Grace]] riding)<ref>Montreal Gazette, 11 November 1976, p. 10.</ref> even through the PNP did not embrace social credit.\n\nSamson was re-elected with 9011 votes (40%) in his riding of [[Rouyn-Noranda (provincial electoral district)|Rouyn-Noranda]].\n\n==Dissolution==\n\nThe Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste du Qu\u00e9bec was dissolved as Camil Samson founded a new party, '''[[Les D\u00e9mocrates]]''', on November 12, 1978.<ref name=\"quebecpolitique.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.quebecpolitique.com/partis/cs.html |title= Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste |accessdate=2006-11-13 | work = Qu\u00e9becPolitique.com |language = French}}</ref> Samson\u2019s partner in establishing the new party was [[Pierre S\u00e9vigny]], a federal cabinet minister in the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] government of [[John Diefenbaker]].

It is the commercial and cultural heart of the barony of Erris, which has a population of almost 10,000.\n\nBelmullet has two bays, [[Blacksod Bay]] and [[Broadhaven Bay]], linked by Carter's Canal running through the town.\n\nIt is also home to forester Martin Doherty. It is said his gay lover lives in Donegal.\n\n==History==\nThe origin of the name ''Belmullet'' is not clear. It may have come from Irish ''B\u00e9al Muileat'' or ''B\u00e9al an Mhuileat'', which has been translated as \"mouth of the [[isthmus]]\".<ref name=\"logainm\"/> Bernard O'Hara in ''Mayo: Aspects of its Heritage'' suggests that \"A change from 'L' to 'R', which is quite common in Irish, may have given ''B\u00e9al an Mhuireat'' which in turn became ''B\u00e9al an Mhuirhead''\". It has also been suggested that the latter half of the name may refer to [[Mullet (fish)|the fish]] or the [[Star (heraldry)|star shape used in heraldry]].<ref>O'Hara, Bernard. ''Mayo: Aspects of its Heritage''. 1982. p. 79<!-- ISSN/ISBN, publisher needed --></ref>\n\n===18th century===\nAccording to [[Richard Pococke]], in about 1715, Sir Arthur Shaen \"began building a little town\" where Belmullet now stands.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} During the reign of [[Queen Elizabeth I]], an admiral chased pirates into Broadhaven Bay, hauled his boats across the [[isthmus]], and caught up with them near the [[Erris|Iniskea Islands]]. To drain the area and form a passageway from Blacksod Bay into Broadhaven Bay, Shaen had a canal excavated, known thereafter as Shaen's Cut, large enough for small boats to pass through from one bay to the other.  However, little development of the town occurred, and by 1752 the canal was choked up and impassable. Belmullet was the scene of [[Monster meetings]] of the [[Land League]] at the end of the 19th century. In the early 19th century Belmullet consisted of little more than a few thatched buildings.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1820, the first [[post office]] in Erris opened in the new town of Belmullet. In 1822, a coastguard station was built. William Henry Carter had inherited huge tracts of Shaen's land in Erris when he married Shaen's daughter and began to put plans in place to develop the town. A new road was built which connected Belmullet with [[Castlebar]], which was completed in 1824.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of Ireland, containing the latest information from the most authentic sources.|last=Lawson|first=John Parker|publisher=Edinburgh Print. & Pub. Co.|year=1842|isbn=|location=Edinburgh|pages=418|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1825, Carter built a pier large enough to accommodate vessels of 100 tons. Carter's stated objective was to \"create a home market for produce that did not previously exist nearer than thirty miles by land,\" and his aim was to thrust the older village of [[Binghamstown|An Geata M\u00f3r (Binghamstown)]], a village founded by the powerful Bingham family on the [[Mullet Peninsula|Mullet peninsula]] into a secondary position.<ref>[[Samuel Lewis (publisher)|Samuel Lewis]], ''Topographical Dictionary of Ireland''</ref> By 1826, the Erris Hotel was opened.<ref>Noone, Fr. Sean. Where the Sun Sets (1991)<!-- ISSN/ISBN, publisher, page(s) needed --></ref>\n\nIn 1829, Alexander Nimmo, an [[engineer]] on the Erris roads, wrote the following: \"at Belmullet, the advance is quite surprising; the place only commenced four years ago; it now consists of about seventy respectable houses etc... five ships were loaded with grain and kept; iron hoops and coal were imported; [[Distilled beverage|spirits]], beer and wine. British manufacturers and tea and [[sugar]] were sold; the produce of the fisheries were admitted to a market.\"<ref>Nimmo, Commissioners of Public Works Report 1 & 2 (1835)</ref>\n\nBy 1831, the population of Belmullet was 585. A Roman Catholic chapel was built in 1832 at the cost of \u00a3300. There was a daily [[postal service]] between [[Ballina, County Mayo|Ballina]] and Belmullet. In 1833, a [[courthouse]] was built also costing \u00a3300 which held weekly court sessions, demonstrating that the town was rapidly growing. In the 1830s, a visitor described it as \"the youngest town in Ireland and like all young things it is comparatively fresh and fair. The town itself contains a few thatched [[Cottage|cabins]] but consists of small streets of moderately sized slated houses branching from a little square, or [[market place]]; the shops looked to be well furnished with not only necessaries but articles conducive to comfort and convenience. Buildings are going on and speculation is progressing'. He also commented that the approach to the town was 'spoiled by deformed, wretched bog huts.\"<ref>Otway, Caesar. Sketches in [[Erris]] & Tyrawley  (1841) Dublin</ref> Two new roads were built - one to the east went to [[Ballycastle, County Mayo|Ballycastle]] and one to the south to [[Newport, County Mayo|Newport]]. The export of meal from the area to England started. The local [[Protestant Church]] was built in 1843. In 1845, work began to re-open the canal which had been constructed by Arthur Shaen. Because of the [[Irish Famine]], the canal was not completed until 1851. During the Relief work for the Distress (in the middle of the Great Famine) in 1846 and 1847, the footpaths were formed and flagged.<ref>CSORPD5577 (1846)</ref>\n\nIn the latter half of the 19th century rural unrest was a common occurrence across Mayo. In November 1881, over 100 police officers needed in order to protect two process servers who were serving writs in the town.  The police were confronted by an angry crowd throwing rocks and sticks. The police were obliged to charge the crowd and fire buckshot resulting in a large number of injuries.  The police made 20 arrests.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=The state of Ireland|last=|first=|date=4 November 1881|work=Western Gazette|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA workhouse was erected on the site of the current hospital. The Head of the Treasury, [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet|Charles Trevelyan]], notoriously decreed that relief was only to be given to workhouse people.  Starving people crowded to the workhouse. At one stage at the height of the Famine, 3,000 people were recorded as being in Belmullet workhouse.\nThe area around Belmullet was severely impacted by the Great Irish Famine in the 19th century and in the next 100 years many people emigrated from the area to the United States and to England. Throughout the second half of the 19th century, many proposals were made regarding the development of a [[railway line]] in to Belmullet and Erris region. Three routes were surveyed and discussed:\n\n*Route One:    [[Ballina, County Mayo|Ballina]] - [[Ballycastle, County Mayo|Ballycastle]] - Belmullet\n*Route Two:    [[Newport, County Mayo|Newport]] - [[Mulrany]] - Belmullet\n*Route Three:  Ballina - [[Crossmolina]] - Belmullet\n\nPeople along these routes lobbied for the railway lines to pass through their district. However the merchants of Belmullet were more skeptical and feared that the introduction of a railway line would adversely affect their trading position, putting Ballina within easy reach of the population. Plans for a railway to Blacksod, which would have served trans-Atlantic shipping, were therefore postponed. Many still pressed the authorities for a rail line, and this movement gained momentum during the latter days of the [[First World War]], when it was proposed that a line would improve lines of communication between both [[London]] and [[Canada]], and between London and the [[United States]]. However, when the war ended in 1918, the hopes for a railway service to Blacksod ended with it.  In the early 1920, the Sligo Steam Navigation Company ran weekly sailings between Belmullet, Sligo and Liverpool.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Sligo Steam Navigation Company (advert)|last=|first=|date=November 20, 1920|work=Sligo Champion|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBelmullet established a monthly cattle fair, and the town began to take trade from An Geatta M\u00f3r. The Bingham family fought back, but their village was more or less deserted by the cattle traders by the late 19th century.\n\n===Early 20th century===\n[[File:Belmullet.JPG|thumb|Coming into Belmullet town]]\n[[John Millington Synge]], author of \"[[The Playboy of the Western World]]\" and ''[[s:The Aran Islands|The Aran Islands]]'', visited Belmullet in 1904, and reported: ''Belmullet in the evening is noisy and squalid, lonely and crowded at the same time and without appeal to the imagination. So at least one stays for a moment. When one has passed six times up and down hearing a gramophone in one house, a fiddle in the next, then an accordion and a fragment of a traditional lullaby, with many crying babies, pigs and donkeys and noisy girls and young men jostling in the darkness, the effect is not indistinct. All the light comes from doors or windows of shops. Last night was St. John\u2019s Eve and bonfires were lighted all over the country, the largest of all being placed at the Town Square at Belmullet. Today, again, there was a large market in the square, where a number of country people, with their horses and donkeys, stood about bargaining for young pigs, heather brooms, homespun flannels, second hand clothing, blackening brushes, tinker\u2019s goods and many other articles''.<ref>http://towns.mayo-ireland.ie</ref>\n\n=== Irish War of Independence ===\nOne of the two R.I.C.

The policemen intervened to arrest a man for causing a disturbance during a fair.  The crowd attending the fair resented the intervention and turned on the police  officers. The police retreated and took refuge in a house,  One of the officers - Constable Doogue - was later discovered on the street with a wound to the head.

Two Republican Policemen were quelling a row that broke out in the evening after the town's regular fair.  The Republican policemen were attacked by six R.I.C. officers.  The fighting escalated as more RIC and IRA men joined the affray.

From his army pay-book, Cullen identified 21-year-old Donald Domican of the 5th Battalion, the [[Welsh Regiment]]. On the evening of 6 August, Domican\u2019s body was brought to Belmullet hospital.

It was set up in 1996 by [[Mayo County Council]] Arts Office to promote understanding and integration between the people of Erris and communities throughout the world. The festival encompasses all forms of [[folk art]] from dancing to [[visual arts]] to music. All the pubs in Belmullet participate.\n*'''L\u00e1 an Logha''' - 15 August (also known as Ladies Day) each year sees the busiest time of the year in the town.

It is the commercial and cultural heart of the barony of Erris, which has a population of almost 10,000.\n\nBelmullet has two bays, [[Blacksod Bay]] and [[Broadhaven Bay]], linked by Carter's Canal running through the town.\n\n==History==\nThe origin of the name ''Belmullet'' is not clear. It may have come from Irish ''B\u00e9al Muileat'' or ''B\u00e9al an Mhuileat'', which has been translated as \"mouth of the [[isthmus]]\".<ref name=\"logainm\"/> Bernard O'Hara in ''Mayo: Aspects of its Heritage'' suggests that \"A change from 'L' to 'R', which is quite common in Irish, may have given ''B\u00e9al an Mhuireat'' which in turn became ''B\u00e9al an Mhuirhead''\". It has also been suggested that the latter half of the name may refer to [[Mullet (fish)|the fish]] or the [[Star (heraldry)|star shape used in heraldry]].<ref>O'Hara, Bernard. ''Mayo: Aspects of its Heritage''. 1982. p. 79<!-- ISSN/ISBN, publisher needed --></ref>\n\n===18th century===\nAccording to [[Richard Pococke]], in about 1715, Sir Arthur Shaen \"began building a little town\" where Belmullet now stands.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} During the reign of [[Queen Elizabeth I]], an admiral chased pirates into Broadhaven Bay, hauled his boats across the [[isthmus]], and caught up with them near the [[Erris|Iniskea Islands]]. To drain the area and form a passageway from Blacksod Bay into Broadhaven Bay, Shaen had a canal excavated, known thereafter as Shaen's Cut, large enough for small boats to pass through from one bay to the other.  However, little development of the town occurred, and by 1752 the canal was choked up and impassable. Belmullet was the scene of [[Monster meetings]] of the [[Land League]] at the end of the 19th century. In the early 19th century Belmullet consisted of little more than a few thatched buildings.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1820, the first [[post office]] in Erris opened in the new town of Belmullet. In 1822, a coastguard station was built. William Henry Carter had inherited huge tracts of Shaen's land in Erris when he married Shaen's daughter and began to put plans in place to develop the town. A new road was built which connected Belmullet with [[Castlebar]], which was completed in 1824.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of Ireland, containing the latest information from the most authentic sources.|last=Lawson|first=John Parker|publisher=Edinburgh Print. & Pub. Co.|year=1842|isbn=|location=Edinburgh|pages=418|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1825, Carter built a pier large enough to accommodate vessels of 100 tons. Carter's stated objective was to \"create a home market for produce that did not previously exist nearer than thirty miles by land,\" and his aim was to thrust the older village of [[Binghamstown|An Geata M\u00f3r (Binghamstown)]], a village founded by the powerful Bingham family on the [[Mullet Peninsula|Mullet peninsula]] into a secondary position.<ref>[[Samuel Lewis (publisher)|Samuel Lewis]], ''Topographical Dictionary of Ireland''</ref> By 1826, the Erris Hotel was opened.<ref>Noone, Fr. Sean. Where the Sun Sets (1991)<!-- ISSN/ISBN, publisher, page(s) needed --></ref>\n\nIn 1829, Alexander Nimmo, an [[engineer]] on the Erris roads, wrote the following: \"at Belmullet, the advance is quite surprising; the place only commenced four years ago; it now consists of about seventy respectable houses etc... five ships were loaded with grain and kept; iron hoops and coal were imported; [[Distilled beverage|spirits]], beer and wine. British manufacturers and tea and [[sugar]] were sold; the produce of the fisheries were admitted to a market.\"<ref>Nimmo, Commissioners of Public Works Report 1 & 2 (1835)</ref>\n\nBy 1831, the population of Belmullet was 585. A Roman Catholic chapel was built in 1832 at the cost of \u00a3300. There was a daily [[postal service]] between [[Ballina, County Mayo|Ballina]] and Belmullet. In 1833, a [[courthouse]] was built also costing \u00a3300 which held weekly court sessions, demonstrating that the town was rapidly growing. In the 1830s, a visitor described it as \"the youngest town in Ireland and like all young things it is comparatively fresh and fair. The town itself contains a few thatched [[Cottage|cabins]] but consists of small streets of moderately sized slated houses branching from a little square, or [[market place]]; the shops looked to be well furnished with not only necessaries but articles conducive to comfort and convenience. Buildings are going on and speculation is progressing'. He also commented that the approach to the town was 'spoiled by deformed, wretched bog huts.\"<ref>Otway, Caesar. Sketches in [[Erris]] & Tyrawley  (1841) Dublin</ref> Two new roads were built - one to the east went to [[Ballycastle, County Mayo|Ballycastle]] and one to the south to [[Newport, County Mayo|Newport]]. The export of meal from the area to England started. The local [[Protestant Church]] was built in 1843. In 1845, work began to re-open the canal which had been constructed by Arthur Shaen. Because of the [[Irish Famine]], the canal was not completed until 1851. During the Relief work for the Distress (in the middle of the Great Famine) in 1846 and 1847, the footpaths were formed and flagged.<ref>CSORPD5577 (1846)</ref>\n\nIn the latter half of the 19th century rural unrest was a common occurrence across Mayo. In November 1881, over 100 police officers needed in order to protect two process servers who were serving writs in the town.  The police were confronted by an angry crowd throwing rocks and sticks. The police were obliged to charge the crowd and fire buckshot resulting in a large number of injuries.  The police made 20 arrests.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=The state of Ireland|last=|first=|date=4 November 1881|work=Western Gazette|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA workhouse was erected on the site of the current hospital. The Head of the Treasury, [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet|Charles Trevelyan]], notoriously decreed that relief was only to be given to workhouse people.  Starving people crowded to the workhouse. At one stage at the height of the Famine, 3,000 people were recorded as being in Belmullet workhouse.\nThe area around Belmullet was severely impacted by the Great Irish Famine in the 19th century and in the next 100 years many people emigrated from the area to the United States and to England. Throughout the second half of the 19th century, many proposals were made regarding the development of a [[railway line]] in to Belmullet and Erris region. Three routes were surveyed and discussed:\n\n*Route One:    [[Ballina, County Mayo|Ballina]] - [[Ballycastle, County Mayo|Ballycastle]] - Belmullet\n*Route Two:    [[Newport, County Mayo|Newport]] - [[Mulrany]] - Belmullet\n*Route Three:  Ballina - [[Crossmolina]] - Belmullet\n\nPeople along these routes lobbied for the railway lines to pass through their district. However the merchants of Belmullet were more skeptical and feared that the introduction of a railway line would adversely affect their trading position, putting Ballina within easy reach of the population. Plans for a railway to Blacksod, which would have served trans-Atlantic shipping, were therefore postponed. Many still pressed the authorities for a rail line, and this movement gained momentum during the latter days of the [[First World War]], when it was proposed that a line would improve lines of communication between both [[London]] and [[Canada]], and between London and the [[United States]]. However, when the war ended in 1918, the hopes for a railway service to Blacksod ended with it.  In the early 1920, the Sligo Steam Navigation Company ran weekly sailings between Belmullet, Sligo and Liverpool.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Sligo Steam Navigation Company (advert)|last=|first=|date=November 20, 1920|work=Sligo Champion|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBelmullet established a monthly cattle fair, and the town began to take trade from An Geatta M\u00f3r. The Bingham family fought back, but their village was more or less deserted by the cattle traders by the late 19th century.\n\n===Early 20th century===\n[[File:Belmullet.JPG|thumb|Coming into Belmullet town]]\n[[John Millington Synge]], author of \"[[The Playboy of the Western World]]\" and ''[[s:The Aran Islands|The Aran Islands]]'', visited Belmullet in 1904, and reported: ''Belmullet in the evening is noisy and squalid, lonely and crowded at the same time and without appeal to the imagination. So at least one stays for a moment. When one has passed six times up and down hearing a gramophone in one house, a fiddle in the next, then an accordion and a fragment of a traditional lullaby, with many crying babies, pigs and donkeys and noisy girls and young men jostling in the darkness, the effect is not indistinct. All the light comes from doors or windows of shops. Last night was St. John\u2019s Eve and bonfires were lighted all over the country, the largest of all being placed at the Town Square at Belmullet. Today, again, there was a large market in the square, where a number of country people, with their horses and donkeys, stood about bargaining for young pigs, heather brooms, homespun flannels, second hand clothing, blackening brushes, tinker\u2019s goods and many other articles''.<ref>http://towns.mayo-ireland.ie</ref>\n\n=== Irish War of Independence ===\nOne of the two R.I.C. Policemen killed in the January 1919 [[Soloheadbeg ambush|Soloheadbeg]] ambush - Constable McDonnell - was born in Belmullet.  The event triggered the War of Independence.  Constable McDonnell was 50 at the time of his death.  He left a widow and five children.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Men Drive Away in Cart Laden with Gelignite|last=|first=|date=January 22, 1919|work=Freemans Journal|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nOn October 26, 1919 a young boy was shot and wounded by a sentry guarding the local wireless station.  The boy was driving cows near his home early in the morning, when he was shot in the shoulder. The incident caused great indignation among the local population.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Youth shot by sentry near Belmullet|last=|first=|date=October 27, 1919|work=Evening Herald|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1920, an R.I.C. policeman was killed and three were injured during a riot on the main street of the town.  The policemen intervened to arrest a man for causing a disturbance during a fair.  The crowd attending the fair resented the intervention and turned on the police  officers. The police retreated and took refuge in a house,  One of the officers - Constable Doogue - was later discovered on the street with a wound to the head.  When the doctor arrived, he was found to be dead.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Policeman killed in Belmullet Disturbance|last=|first=|date=June 17, 1920|work=Belfast Newsletter|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn late August 1920, the local Coastguard station was attacked.  The raiders were interrupted by a police patrol, and shots were exchanged.  The raiders escaped but not before the station was destroyed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Raiders surprised|last=|first=|date=September 4, 1920|work=Skibbereen Eagle|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the latter stages of the conflict, a Republican Court was established in the town. In January 1921 Two Ballina Solicitors - PJ Ruttledge and Henry Bourke - were arrested and charged by the British military authorities for participating in the court.   Mr. Ruttledge declined to recognize the British court and was subsequently jailed in Castlebar.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Ballina Solicitors charged|last=|first=|date=January 15, 1921|work=Connaught Telegraph|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA breach of the Anglo Irish Truce occurred in the Town in October 1921.  Two Republican Policemen were quelling a row that broke out in the evening after the town's regular fair.  The Republican policemen were attacked by six R.I.C. officers.  The fighting escalated as more RIC and IRA men joined the affray.  Later, shots were exchanged by the two sides.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Republicans stated to have been beaten in Belmullet|last=|first=|date=October 22, 1921|work=Freemans Journal|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Second World War ===\nOn 6 August 1940, during the [[Second World War]], Garda William Cullen of Belmullet station received a phone call from coast-watchers at the nearby Annagh Head lookout post. He learned that the Atlantic currents had washed ashore the body of a British soldier.

The film is a sequel to the 2016 film ''[[Trolls (film)|Trolls]]'', directed by [[Walt Dohrn]] with co-direction by David P. Smith, produced by [[Gina Shay]], and written by [[Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger|Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Berger]], Elizabeth Tippet, [[Maya Forbes]] and [[Wallace Wolodarsky]], from a story by Aibel and Berger. The film stars [[Anna Kendrick]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[James Corden]], [[Kunal Nayyar]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], and [[Rachel Bloom]].\n\n''Trolls World Tour'' was theatrically released in the United States on April 10, 2020. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]], the film was also released for [[video on demand|digital rental]] on the same day.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens on a celebration of the Techno Trolls, which is crashed by the Hard Rock Trolls, led by Queen Barb. After Barb destroys his DJ station with her guitar's power, King Trollex is forced to surrender the string that powers Techno music. \n\nPoppy, still becoming adjusted to her new leadership as queen, recieves a message from Barb that invites all Trolls to a party to unite their music. Her father reveals that there are different kinds of Trolls scattered through their land, having split into their different forms of music following discord and disagreement over which was the best. Poppy wants to help Barb unite the different forms of music, but both her father and Branch warn her not to trust Barb's intentions and to accept that the other Trolls are different. Poppy does not listen, and sends a cheerful reply to Barb via Debbie, Barb's pet bat.\n\nMeanwhile, Barb gloats over her victory of snatching the Techno string, revealing her plan to string an enchanted guitar with all six strings, and play a power cord strong enough to destroy all other music, replacing it with rock.\n\nWanting to prove herself as a good queen, Poppy travels via air balloon to recruit the other groups of Trolls, Branch joining her in an attempt to express his feelings towards her. Biggie accidentally stows aboard the balloon, and joins them. Meanwhile, Cooper, who feels like the black sheep among the Pop trolls, goes on a journey himself to find Trolls who look like him.\n\nThe balloon ends up in the land of Classical Trolls, which, to Poppy's horror, has been decimated by Barb's armada, who captured all the citizens. A single small flute named Pennywhistle tells Poppy the truth about what happened, and Poppy decides to now unite the other Trolls to stop Barb. Branch and Biggie both urge her to return home to protect the Pop string, but Poppy reveals it hidden in her hair. They then travel to the Country Trolls' land, but after introducing themselves with a loud medley of pop songs, are jailed by an offended Delta Dawn. A Country Troll named Hickory, who claims he is moved by Poppy's motives, breaks them out, leading to a chase to a ravine, where the group falls into a river. Branch does not trust Hickory, even when the Troll builds a raft to take the group downstream.  The conversation is interrupted by Chaz, a Smooth Jazz Troll who was hired as a bounty hunter to catch Poppy for Barb, who was incredibly offended by Poppy's reply letter. Hickory incapacitates Chaz, but Biggie, disillusioned by Poppy's poor leadership, decides to return home. Shortly after, the group is abducted by a space ship wielding magical soap bubbles.\n\nInside the spaceship, the group meets the Funk Trolls, and meets up with Cooper, who is revealed to have been a long lost identical twin prince of Funk all along. Cooper tells Poppy he finds comfort in identifying with both Pop and Funk, and his parents, King Quincy and Queen Essence, reveal to Poppy that the Trolls divided their music long ago because the Pop Trolls had attempted to steal the strings, like Barb is doing now.  Quincy explains to Poppy that differences aren't bad, and trying to make all Trolls the same doesn't help the problem.\n\nAfter the Rock Trolls hi-jack the Funk Trolls' ship, Cooper ejects the group in bubbles, accidentally separating Hickory from the two. Branch and Poppy fight when Poppy refuses to return home to their friends, and Branch admonishes her insisting she can't be a good queen if she's a poor listener, and the two go their separate ways, heartbroken. Branch is soon captured by both K-Pop and Reggae-tron bounty hunters. However, he eventually convinces them to so stop capturing and fighting and save Poppy and all music.\n\nPoppy reunites with Hickory, showing him the Pop string. Hickory tries to urge her to return home, but suddenly is revealed to have been a Yodel Troll all along. He and another Yodel Troll, Dickory, had been hired to capture her for Barb, but Hickory had a change of heart. Before she can escape, Poppy is then captured personally by Barb, who takes possession of the sixth and final string. \n\nBiggie returns home and seeing it in shambles, feels remorse over abandoning Poppy. He gathers together their remaining friends to go rescue her and Branch, entering the land of the Rock Trolls.\n\nBarb has Poppy imprisoned over a large concert stage where all the captured Trolls are the audience, and admits she empathizes with Poppy's attempts to be a good queen, as she is trying to make rock supreme to prove her own leadership. Barb uses her enchanted guitar during the concert to turn Branch, and the leaders of the other lands into rock zombies. Poppy seemingly is transformed into a rock zombie when she falls onto the stage, but upon grabbing Barb's guitar, it is revealed to have been wearing gumdrop earplugs. She admonishes Barb for being a poor queen by not taking time to listen to her people, and smashes the guitar. While it snaps the possessed trolls out of their rock zombie state, it destroys the strings, ending music, and causing all the trolls to lose their colors, much to Barb\u2019s anguish.\n\nCooper hears his heartbeat over a microphone, and creates a rhythmic beat with it, other trolls joining in with clapping, stomping, and other forms of soundmaking, reviving the power of their music, and Poppy encourages everyone to sing together as their colors are restored. Realizing how important other forms of music are, and encouraged by her father, Barb joins in, regaining her colors, and eagerly accepts Poppy's offer of friendship. \n\nBranch is finally able to profess his love to Poppy who reciprocates his feelings, and everyone performs together, all Trolls finally reunited while celebrating their differences.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Bridget and King Gristle arrive to the Pop Troll village, unaware of the events of the film, and worried they have missed the party.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Queen Poppy, the sweetest, optimistic Queen of the pop Trolls and Branch's love interest.\n* [[Justin Timberlake]] as Branch, an over-cautious, good-hearted survivalist pop Troll and Poppy's love interest.\n* [[James Corden]] as Biggie, a chubby, friendly pop Troll.\n* [[Rachel Bloom]] as Queen Barb, the Queen of the Hard Rock Trolls and Thrash's daughter.\n* [[Ozzy Osbourne]] as King Thrash, former King of the Hard Rock Trolls and Barb's father.\n* [[Anderson Paak]] as Prince D, a Funk Troll and Quincy and Essence's son and Cooper\u2019s twin brother.\n* [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] as King Quincy, the King of the Funk Trolls.\n* [[Mary J.

The film is a sequel to the 2016 film ''[[Trolls (film)|Trolls]]'', directed by [[Walt Dohrn]] with co-direction by David P. Smith, produced by [[Gina Shay]], and written by [[Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger|Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Berger]], Elizabeth Tippet, [[Maya Forbes]] and [[Wallace Wolodarsky]], from a story by Aibel and Berger. The film stars [[Anna Kendrick]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[James Corden]], [[Kunal Nayyar]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], and [[Rachel Bloom]].\n\n''Trolls World Tour'' was theatrically released in the United States on April 10, 2020. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]], the film was also released for [[video on demand|digital rental]] on the same day.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens on a celebration of the Techno Trolls, which is crashed by the Hard Rock Trolls, led by Queen Barb. After Barb destroys his DJ station with her guitar's power, King Trollex is forced to surrender the string that powers Techno music. \n\nPoppy, still becoming adjusted to her new leadership as queen, recieves a message from Barb that invites all Trolls to a party to unite their music. Her father reveals that there are different kinds of Trolls scattered through their land, having split into their different forms of music following discord and disagreement over which was the best. Poppy wants to help Barb unite the different forms of music, but both her father and Branch warn her not to trust Barb's intentions and to accept that the other Trolls are different. Poppy does not listen, and sends a cheerful reply to Barb via Debbie, Barb's pet bat.\n\nMeanwhile, Barb gloats over her victory of snatching the Techno string, revealing her plan to string an enchanted guitar with all six strings, and play a power cord strong enough to destroy all other music, replacing it with rock.\n\nWanting to prove herself as a good queen, Poppy travels via air balloon to recruit the other groups of Trolls, Branch joining her in an attempt to express his feelings towards her. Biggie accidentally stows aboard the balloon, and joins them. Meanwhile, Cooper, who feels like the black sheep among the Pop trolls, goes on a journey himself to find Trolls who look like him.\n\nThe balloon ends up in the land of Classical Trolls, which, to Poppy's horror, has been decimated by Barb's armada, who captured all the citizens. A single small flute named Pennywhistle tells Poppy the truth about what happened, and Poppy decides to now unite the other Trolls to stop Barb. Branch and Biggie both urge her to return home to protect the Pop string, but Poppy reveals it hidden in her hair. They then travel to the Country Trolls' land, but after introducing themselves with a loud medley of pop songs, are jailed by an offended Delta Dawn. A Country Troll named Hickory, who claims he is moved by Poppy's motives, breaks them out, leading to a chase to a ravine, where the group falls into a river. Branch does not trust Hickory, even when the Troll builds a raft to take the group downstream.  The conversation is interrupted by Chaz, a Smooth Jazz Troll who was hired as a bounty hunter to catch Poppy for Barb, who was incredibly offended by Poppy's reply letter. Hickory incapacitates Chaz, but Biggie, disillusioned by Poppy's poor leadership, decides to return home. Shortly after, the group is abducted by a space ship wielding magical soap bubbles.\n\nInside the spaceship, the group meets the Funk Trolls, and meets up with Cooper, who is revealed to have been a long lost identical twin prince of Funk all along. Cooper tells Poppy he finds comfort in identifying with both Pop and Funk, and his parents, King Quincy and Queen Essence, reveal to Poppy that the Trolls divided their music long ago because the Pop Trolls had attempted to steal the strings, like Barb is doing now.  Quincy explains to Poppy that differences aren't bad, and trying to make all Trolls the same doesn't help the problem.\n\nAfter the Rock Trolls hi-jack the Funk Trolls' ship, Cooper ejects the group in bubbles, accidentally separating Hickory from the two. Branch and Poppy fight when Poppy refuses to return home to their friends, and Branch admonishes her insisting she can't be a good queen if she's a poor listener, and the two go their separate ways, heartbroken. Branch is soon captured by both K-Pop and Reggae-tron bounty hunters. However, he eventually convinces them to so stop capturing and fighting and save Poppy and all music.\n\nPoppy reunites with Hickory, showing him the Pop string. Hickory tries to urge her to return home, but suddenly is revealed to have been a Yodel Troll all along. He and another Yodel Troll, Dickory, had been hired to capture her for Barb, but Hickory had a change of heart. Before she can escape, Poppy is then captured personally by Barb, who takes possession of the sixth and final string. \n\nBiggie returns home and seeing it in shambles, feels remorse over abandoning Poppy. He gathers together their remaining friends to go rescue her and Branch, entering the land of the Rock Trolls.\n\nBarb has Poppy imprisoned over a large concert stage where all the captured Trolls are the audience, and admits she empathizes with Poppy's attempts to be a good queen, as she is trying to make rock supreme to prove her own leadership. Barb uses her enchanted guitar during the concert to turn Branch, and the leaders of the other lands into rock zombies. Poppy seemingly is transformed into a rock zombie when she falls onto the stage, but upon grabbing Barb's guitar, it is revealed to have been wearing gumdrop earplugs. She admonishes Barb for being a poor queen by not taking time to listen to her people, and smashes the guitar. While it snaps the possessed trolls out of their rock zombie state, it destroys the strings, ending music, and causing all the trolls to lose their colors, much to Barb\u2019s anguish.\n\nCooper hears his heartbeat over a microphone, and creates a rhythmic beat with it, other trolls joining in with clapping, stomping, and other forms of soundmaking, reviving the power of their music, and Poppy encourages everyone to sing together as their colors are restored. Realizing how important other forms of music are, and encouraged by her father, Barb joins in, regaining her colors, and eagerly accepts Poppy's offer of friendship. \n\nBranch is finally able to profess his love to Poppy who reciprocates his feelings, and everyone performs together, all Trolls finally reunited while celebrating their differences.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Bridget and King Gristle arrive to the Pop Troll village, unaware of the events of the film, and worried they have missed the party.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Queen Poppy, the sweetest, optimistic Queen of the pop Trolls and Branch's love interest.\n* [[Justin Timberlake]] as Branch, an over-cautious, good-hearted survivalist pop Troll and Poppy's love interest.\n* [[James Corden]] as Biggie, a chubby, friendly pop Troll.\n* [[Rachel Bloom]] as Queen Barb, the Queen of the Hard Rock Trolls and Thrash's daughter.\n* [[Ozzy Osbourne]] as King Thrash, former King of the Hard Rock Trolls and Barb's father.\n* [[Anderson Paak]] as Prince D, a Funk Troll and Quincy and Essence's son and Cooper\u2019s twin brother.\n* [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] as King Quincy, the King of the Funk Trolls.\n* [[Mary J.
