The mechanical ventilator is designed for use by trained medical professionals in [[intensive care unit|intensive care units]] and easy to operate. It has a compact design and is relatively inexpensive to manufacture and distribute. The cost is only about 4% of a normal ventilator. In addition, this device does not require pressurized oxygen or air supply, as is normally the case. A first series is manufactured by [[Boston Scientific]].

The parish church was consecrated by Wulfstan, the visiting [[Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester|Bishop of Worcester]], in 1086.

It was also a stopping point on the way from Oxford to London, with many travellers staying in the town's taverns and inns.<ref name=\"buckscc1\"/>\n\nThe paper industry was notable in 17th and 18th century High Wycombe. The Wye's waters were rich in [[chalk]], and therefore ideal for bleaching pulp. The paper industry was soon overtaken by the cloth industry.\n\nWycombe's most famous industry, furniture (particularly [[Windsor chair]]s) took hold in the 19th century, with furniture factories setting up all over the town. Many terraced workers' houses were built to the east and west of town to accommodate those working in the furniture factories. In 1875, it was estimated that there were 4,700 chairs made per day in High Wycombe. When [[Queen Victoria]] visited the town in 1877, the council organised an arch of chairs to be erected over the High Street, with the words \"Long live the Queen\" printed boldly across the arch for the Queen to pass under. [[Wycombe Museum]] includes many examples of locally made chairs and information on the local furniture and lace industries.\n\nThe town's population grew from 13,000 residents in 1881 to 29,000 in 1928. Wycombe was completely dominated socially and economically by the furniture industry and, consequently, there was considerable unemployment and social problems when the industry declined in the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:River Wye Wooburn.jpg|thumb|right|River Wye near [[Wooburn]] Industrial Estate]]\nBy the 1920s, many of the housing areas of Wycombe had decayed into slums.

When the result is known, the [[town crier]] announces \"And no more!\" if the mayor has not gained weight or \"And some more!\" if they have.

The small octagonal-shaped Cornmarket opposite, known locally as the Pepper Pot, was rebuilt to designs by [[Robert Adam]] in 1761. The large parish church of All Saints<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allsaintshighwycombe.org |title=All Saints Church, High Wycombe - home |website=Allsaintshighwycombe.org |date= |accessdate=9 August 2016}}</ref> was founded in 1086, enlarged in the 18th century and extensively restored in 1889. There is a large, well equipped theatre, the [[Wycombe Swan]], which hosts many acts and shows before or after their appearance in the [[West End theatre|West End]].\n\nIn March 2008, a new development of the town centre was completed. This included the demolition and movement of the bus station and the brand new ''[[Eden, High Wycombe|Eden Shopping Centre]]'', with 107 shops, new restaurants, a large bowling alley and cinema and new housing. The old Octagon shopping centre was connected to the new development. The complex, one of the largest in the country, is seen as a major milestone in the regeneration of the town.\n\nThere are out-of-town retail outlets in the suburbs of Cressex (including [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]], [[Asda]] and [[TGI Fridays]]), and Wycombe Marsh, where there is small retail park of shops and restaurants including Hobbycraft, PC World, Pets at Home, Argos, Homebase and M&S Simply Food. Desborough Road provides a secondary shopping area with more independent traders and a number of [[Take-out|takeaways]].\n\nTo the east of the town centre is the extensive Rye park (and [[River Wye, Buckinghamshire|river]]) and dyke. The park had an outdoor [[swimming pool]], which closed in 2009.

Built in the [[Regency era|Regency period]], the architecturally appealing house was also home to [[Benjamin Disraeli]] for three decades in the mid-19th century. The three-floor mansion is situated in its own extensive grounds with beautifully landscaped gardens which back into the attractive Chiltern countryside. It is open to the public all year round as an historical attraction.\n\nThe local council maintains a landmark statue of a red lion above the former [[Woolworths Group|Woolworth's]] store on the High Street. Its significance dates back to when the building was the ''Red Lion Hotel''. Since its installation, the lion has been replaced several times and has had to undergo extensive repair due to damage from both the elements and human interference. Another notable landmark is the ruins of the [[Hospital of St John the Baptist, High Wycombe|Hospital of St John the Baptist]],<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Wycombe |volume=28 |page=871}}</ref> which is located on Easton Street, just east of the town centre opposite the Rye parkland, and dates to the 12th century. The stone structure is one of the very oldest in Wycombe, and is said to contain stone used from the Roman villa on the Rye.\n\nThe site of the ancient [[Desborough Castle]] is situated between the Desborough and Castlefield suburbs of the town, and provides their names.\n\n==Industry==\nWycombe was once renowned for [[chairmaking]] (the town's football team is nicknamed the 'Chairboys') and furniture design remains an important element of the town's university curriculum, [[Buckinghamshire New University]]. Among the best known furniture companies were [[Ercol]] and [[E Gomme]]. The [[River Wye, Buckinghamshire|River Wye]] runs through the valley, where [[beech]] trees were cut down by the chair industry to forming the town centre (circa 1700), with housing along the slopes (some areas are still surrounded by woods). The town was also home to the worldwide [[postage stamp]] and [[banknote]] printer [[Harrison and Sons]]. More recent industries in the town include the production of paper, precision instruments, clothing and plastics. Many of these are situated in an industrial area of the Cressex district, southwest of the town centre. The two largest sites belong to the companies [[House of Swan|Swan]] (tobacco papers, filters and matches) and Verco (office furniture), who until 2004 sponsored the local football team, Wycombe Wanderers.\n\nWycombe's industrial past is reflected on the town's motto ''Industria ditat'', \"Industry enriches\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pine|first1=L.G.|title=A dictionary of mottoes|date=1983|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=0-7100-9339-X|page=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofmott00tion/page/113 113]|edition=1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofmott00tion/page/113}}</ref>  The motto can be found on town crest and Mayor's badge of office.<ref name=\"High Wycombe Mayor's Office\">{{cite web|url=http://mayorofwycombe.co.uk/history-and-traditions/history-of-wycombes-swan/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=28 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724134535/http://mayorofwycombe.co.uk/history-and-traditions/history-of-wycombes-swan/ |archivedate=24 July 2011  }}</ref>\n\n==Local attractions==\n{{div col}}\n* [[St Lawrence's Church, West Wycombe|St. Lawrence's Church]]\n* [[File:Museum icon.svg]] [[West Wycombe Park|Dashwood Mausoleum]]\n* The Rye and Holywell Mead{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n* [https://www.oddsfarm.co.uk/ Odds Farm Park]\n* [[File:Museum icon.svg]] [[Disraeli Monument]]\n* [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers F.

Many of the replica aircraft used in the film industry, for example in films such as ''[[Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines]]'', ''[[Aces High (film)|Aces High]]'' and ''[[The Blue Max]]'' were built and flown there. There is a restaurant (The Pad) with outdoor picnic tables that is open to visitors beneath the [[control tower]]. Wycombe Air Park is one of the busiest [[general aviation]] airfields in the UK. The [[Air Park]] is also home to Buckinghamshire Squash and Racketball Club.\n\nThere is also a large [[leisure centre]] to the south of town at the top of Marlow Hill. Many sporting activities take place here and there is an [[Olympic-size swimming pool]], which can be split into two 25-metre pools by raising and lowering a wall. The leisure centre was designed by renowned architect John Attenborough.

There are many different housing areas within the town, some of which such as the Castlefield district have gained a bad reputation for crime and drug-related problems.\n\nThe town is a diverse mixture of large council estates built in the 1930s, 1950s and 1960s that sprawl up the valley sides, compact [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] terraces in the bottom of the valley to the east and west of town, and desirable areas for wealthy commuters. The Amersham Hill area is noted for its large period properties and leafy streets. Recent developments are showing a tendency towards blocks of flats, and developers are mainly making use of brownfield sites.\n\n==Sport==\nThe town's [[Association football|football]] team, [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], play at [[Adams Park]], named after Frank Adams who donated the old Loakes Park ground to the club. They relocated to their current stadium in 1990. They are currently members of [[Football League One]] and have been members of the [[Football League]] since 1993 when they were promoted as champions of the [[Football Conference]]. Since then they have enjoyed two notable cup runs (to the semi-finals of the [[FA Cup]] in 2001 and the [[Football League Cup]] in 2007) and three recent promotions from the fourth tier of the English league to League One (via the playoffs in 1994 and automatically in 2009, 2011 and 2018).

Wycombe is a combination of industrial and [[market town]], with a traditional emphasis on furniture production. There has been a market held in the High Street since at least the [[Middle Ages]]. The market is currently held on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday.<ref>https://www.visitbuckinghamshire.org/article/high-wycombe</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n[[File:High Wycombe map1945.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A map of High Wycombe from 1945]]\nThe name Wycombe appears to come from the river Wye and the old English word for a wooded valley, [[combe]], but according to the ''Oxford English Dictionary of Place-Names'' the name, which was first recorded in 799-802 as 'Wichama', is more likely to be Old English 'wic' and the plural of Old English 'ham', and probably means 'dwellings'; the name of the river was a late back-formation.<ref>Eilert Ekwall, 1960. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary of Place-Names. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0198691033}}.</ref> Wycombe appears in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' of 1086 and was noted for having six mills.

The parish church was consecrated by Wulfstan, the visiting [[Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester|Bishop of Worcester]], in 1086. The town received market borough status in 1222, and built its first [[moot hall]] in 1226, with a market hall being built later in 1476.<ref name=\"buckscc1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/media/130564/high_wycombe_report.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222134003/http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/media/130564/high_wycombe_report.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 February 2014 |format=PDF |title=High Wycombe : Historic Town Assessment Report Draft |website=Buckscc.gov.uk |accessdate=9 August 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe 1841 census reports the population that year was 3,184.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge'' Vol.III, London, 1847, Charles Knight, p.899</ref>\n\n===Trade and industrial development===\nHigh Wycombe remained a mill town through Medieval and [[Tudor period|Tudor]] times, manufacturing [[lace]] and [[linen]] cloth. It was also a stopping point on the way from Oxford to London, with many travellers staying in the town's taverns and inns.<ref name=\"buckscc1\"/>\n\nThe paper industry was notable in 17th and 18th century High Wycombe. The Wye's waters were rich in [[chalk]], and therefore ideal for bleaching pulp. The paper industry was soon overtaken by the cloth industry.\n\nWycombe's most famous industry, furniture (particularly [[Windsor chair]]s) took hold in the 19th century, with furniture factories setting up all over the town. Many terraced workers' houses were built to the east and west of town to accommodate those working in the furniture factories. In 1875, it was estimated that there were 4,700 chairs made per day in High Wycombe. When [[Queen Victoria]] visited the town in 1877, the council organised an arch of chairs to be erected over the High Street, with the words \"Long live the Queen\" printed boldly across the arch for the Queen to pass under. [[Wycombe Museum]] includes many examples of locally made chairs and information on the local furniture and lace industries.\n\nThe town's population grew from 13,000 residents in 1881 to 29,000 in 1928. Wycombe was completely dominated socially and economically by the furniture industry and, consequently, there was considerable unemployment and social problems when the industry declined in the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:River Wye Wooburn.jpg|thumb|right|River Wye near [[Wooburn]] Industrial Estate]]\nBy the 1920s, many of the housing areas of Wycombe had decayed into slums. A [[slum clearance]] scheme was initiated by the council in 1932, whereby many areas were completely demolished and the residents rehoused in new estates that sprawled above the town on the valley slopes.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Other Elizabeth Taylor|first=Nicola|last=Beauman|publisher=Persephone|year=2009|p=175|isbn=978-190-646210-9}}</ref> Some of the districts demolished were truly decrepit, such as Newland, where most of the houses were condemned as unfit for human habitation, with sewage pouring down the street and people sharing one room in cramped quarters of subdivided flats.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} However, some areas such as St. Mary's Street contained beautiful old buildings with fine examples of 18th and 19th century architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitoruk.com/HighWycombe/20th-century-T2208.html |title=Timeline History of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire |website=Visitoruk.com |date= |accessdate=9 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1940 to 1968 High Wycombe was the seat of the [[RAF Bomber Command]]. Moreover, during the [[Second World War]], from May 1942 to July 1945, the [[U.S. Army Air Force]]'s [[8th Air Force]] Bomber Command, codenamed \"Pinetree\", was based at a former girls' school at High Wycombe.

The small octagonal-shaped Cornmarket opposite, known locally as the Pepper Pot, was rebuilt to designs by [[Robert Adam]] in 1761. The large parish church of All Saints<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allsaintshighwycombe.org |title=All Saints Church, High Wycombe - home |website=Allsaintshighwycombe.org |date= |accessdate=9 August 2016}}</ref> was founded in 1086, enlarged in the 18th century and extensively restored in 1889. There is a large, well equipped theatre, the [[Wycombe Swan]], which hosts many acts and shows before or after their appearance in the [[West End theatre|West End]].\n\nIn March 2008, a new development of the town centre was completed. This included the demolition and movement of the bus station and the brand new ''[[Eden, High Wycombe|Eden Shopping Centre]]'', with 107 shops, new restaurants, a large bowling alley and cinema and new housing. The old Octagon shopping centre was connected to the new development. The complex, one of the largest in the country, is seen as a major milestone in the regeneration of the town.\n\nThere are out-of-town retail outlets in the suburbs of Cressex (including [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]], [[Asda]] and [[TGI Fridays]]), and Wycombe Marsh, where there is small retail park of shops and restaurants including Hobbycraft, PC World, Pets at Home, Argos, Homebase and M&S Simply Food. Desborough Road provides a secondary shopping area with more independent traders and a number of [[Take-out|takeaways]].\n\nTo the east of the town centre is the extensive Rye park (and [[River Wye, Buckinghamshire|river]]) and dyke. The park had an outdoor [[swimming pool]], which closed in 2009. The pool has now reopened together with a new gym and has been renamed as the Rye Lido.<ref name=\"bucksfreepress.co.uk\">{{cite web|author=Simon Farr |url=http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/9791984.Council_boss_hails_Rye_Lido_ahead_of_centre_s_opening/ |title=Council boss hails Wycombe Rye Lido ahead of centre's opening (From Bucks Free Press) |website=Bucksfreepress.co.uk |date= |accessdate=9 August 2016}}</ref> The River Wye winds through the green space, which is particularly attractive during the summer. Wycombe's yearly \"Asian Mela\" takes place on the Rye. There is a museum on Priory Avenue in the town centre situated on its own grounds and including a [[Normans|Norman]] [[castle]] [[Motte-and-bailey castle|mound]]. The theme of the museum is the history of Wycombe, with the main focus being the chair industry.\n\nWycombe town centre is home to many public houses and bars, especially in the Frogmoor area.

Built in the [[Regency era|Regency period]], the architecturally appealing house was also home to [[Benjamin Disraeli]] for three decades in the mid-19th century. The three-floor mansion is situated in its own extensive grounds with beautifully landscaped gardens which back into the attractive Chiltern countryside. It is open to the public all year round as an historical attraction.\n\nThe local council maintains a landmark statue of a red lion above the former [[Woolworths Group|Woolworth's]] store on the High Street. Its significance dates back to when the building was the ''Red Lion Hotel''. Since its installation, the lion has been replaced several times and has had to undergo extensive repair due to damage from both the elements and human interference. Another notable landmark is the ruins of the [[Hospital of St John the Baptist, High Wycombe|Hospital of St John the Baptist]],<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Wycombe |volume=28 |page=871}}</ref> which is located on Easton Street, just east of the town centre opposite the Rye parkland, and dates to the 12th century. The stone structure is one of the very oldest in Wycombe, and is said to contain stone used from the Roman villa on the Rye.\n\nThe site of the ancient [[Desborough Castle]] is situated between the Desborough and Castlefield suburbs of the town, and provides their names.\n\n==Industry==\nWycombe was once renowned for [[chairmaking]] (the town's football team is nicknamed the 'Chairboys') and furniture design remains an important element of the town's university curriculum, [[Buckinghamshire New University]]. Among the best known furniture companies were [[Ercol]] and [[E Gomme]]. The [[River Wye, Buckinghamshire|River Wye]] runs through the valley, where [[beech]] trees were cut down by the chair industry to forming the town centre (circa 1700), with housing along the slopes (some areas are still surrounded by woods). The town was also home to the worldwide [[postage stamp]] and [[banknote]] printer [[Harrison and Sons]]. More recent industries in the town include the production of paper, precision instruments, clothing and plastics. Many of these are situated in an industrial area of the Cressex district, southwest of the town centre. The two largest sites belong to the companies [[House of Swan|Swan]] (tobacco papers, filters and matches) and Verco (office furniture), who until 2004 sponsored the local football team, Wycombe Wanderers.\n\nWycombe's industrial past is reflected on the town's motto ''Industria ditat'', \"Industry enriches\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pine|first1=L.G.|title=A dictionary of mottoes|date=1983|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=0-7100-9339-X|page=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofmott00tion/page/113 113]|edition=1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofmott00tion/page/113}}</ref>  The motto can be found on town crest and Mayor's badge of office.<ref name=\"High Wycombe Mayor's Office\">{{cite web|url=http://mayorofwycombe.co.uk/history-and-traditions/history-of-wycombes-swan/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=28 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724134535/http://mayorofwycombe.co.uk/history-and-traditions/history-of-wycombes-swan/ |archivedate=24 July 2011  }}</ref>\n\n==Local attractions==\n{{div col}}\n* [[St Lawrence's Church, West Wycombe|St. Lawrence's Church]]\n* [[File:Museum icon.svg]] [[West Wycombe Park|Dashwood Mausoleum]]\n* The Rye and Holywell Mead{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n* [https://www.oddsfarm.co.uk/ Odds Farm Park]\n* [[File:Museum icon.svg]] [[Disraeli Monument]]\n* [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers F.

Many of the replica aircraft used in the film industry, for example in films such as ''[[Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines]]'', ''[[Aces High (film)|Aces High]]'' and ''[[The Blue Max]]'' were built and flown there. There is a restaurant (The Pad) with outdoor picnic tables that is open to visitors beneath the [[control tower]]. Wycombe Air Park is one of the busiest [[general aviation]] airfields in the UK. The [[Air Park]] is also home to Buckinghamshire Squash and Racketball Club.\n\nThere is also a large [[leisure centre]] to the south of town at the top of Marlow Hill. Many sporting activities take place here and there is an [[Olympic-size swimming pool]], which can be split into two 25-metre pools by raising and lowering a wall. The leisure centre was designed by renowned architect John Attenborough. It will be demolished to make way for other developments once a new sports centre is completed on the site in 2015/16.<ref>{{cite news|title=Construction begins on new Wycombe Sports Centre|url=http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/11227629.Construction_begins_on_new_Wycombe_Sports_Centre/|first=Simon |last=Farr|date=21 May 2014|publisher=Bucks Free Press|accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter a \u00a32 million investment into the former Holywell Mead open swimming pool site in the town's Rye Park, a new sports & leisure facility was reopened in the summer of 2012.<ref name=\"bucksfreepress.co.uk\"/>\n\n==Housing==\nA new experimental scheme to knock down old council flats in [[Micklefield, High Wycombe|Micklefield]] and replace them with [[housing association]] properties was approved by [[John Prescott]] in 2003 after overwhelming approval by council residents. There are many different housing areas within the town, some of which such as the Castlefield district have gained a bad reputation for crime and drug-related problems.\n\nThe town is a diverse mixture of large council estates built in the 1930s, 1950s and 1960s that sprawl up the valley sides, compact [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] terraces in the bottom of the valley to the east and west of town, and desirable areas for wealthy commuters. The Amersham Hill area is noted for its large period properties and leafy streets. Recent developments are showing a tendency towards blocks of flats, and developers are mainly making use of brownfield sites.\n\n==Sport==\nThe town's [[Association football|football]] team, [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], play at [[Adams Park]], named after Frank Adams who donated the old Loakes Park ground to the club. They relocated to their current stadium in 1990. They are currently members of [[Football League One]] and have been members of the [[Football League]] since 1993 when they were promoted as champions of the [[Football Conference]]. Since then they have enjoyed two notable cup runs (to the semi-finals of the [[FA Cup]] in 2001 and the [[Football League Cup]] in 2007) and three recent promotions from the fourth tier of the English league to League One (via the playoffs in 1994 and automatically in 2009, 2011 and 2018). They have been managed by a number of high-profile football figures, including [[Martin O'Neill]], [[Lawrie Sanchez]] and [[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]]. Their current manager is former [[Queens Park Rangers]] player/manager [[Gareth Ainsworth]].\n\nThe [[Wasps RFC|Wasps]] [[rugby union]] team has also played at Adams Park for home games between the 2002\u201303 season and December 2014, the club's most successful spell.

As tensions rise between the herbivores and carnivores across the campus of Cherryton, the school's Drama Club attempts to continue practicing for their play in honor of their late member.
