In the 5th century, they followed the [[Visigoths]] in creating one of the two great [[Goths|Gothic]] kingdoms within the [[Roman Empire]], based upon the large Gothic populations who had settled in the [[Balkans]] in the 4th century, having crossed the [[Lower Danube]]. While the Visigoths had formed under the leadership of [[Alaric I]], the new Ostrogothic political entity which came to rule Italy, was formed in the Balkans under the influence of the [[Amal Dynasty]].\n\nAs with other Gothic groups, the history of the peoples who made them up before they reached the Roman Balkans is difficult to reconstruct in detail. However, the Ostrogoths are associated with the earlier [[Greuthungi]]. The Ostrogoths themselves were more commonly referred to simply as Goths even in the 5th century, but before then they were referred to once, in a poem by [[Claudian]] which associates them with a group of Greuthungi. Furthermore, the 6th century historian of the Goths Jordanes also equated the Ostrogoths of his time to the Goths ruled by King [[Ermanaric]] in the 4th century, who the Roman writer [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] had called Greuthungi, and described as living between the [[Dniester]] and [[Don river|Don]] rivers. He also mentioned that Ermanaric committed suicide when the [[Huns]] and [[Alans]] attacked his people from the east. After this, the Gothic peoples moved massively into the Roman empire, or became subservient to the Huns.\n\nAfter the death of [[Attila]] and collapse of the [[Hunnic empire]] after the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 453, the [[Amal Dynasty]], the family of   [[Theodoric the Great]] became preeminent, and began to form their kingdom within the Roman Balkans. Eventually, the Emperor [[Zeno]] backed Theoderic to invade Italy and replace [[Odoacer]] there as its king, under imperial authority. In 493 he established the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] of [[Italy]], when Theodoric defeated Odoacer's forces and killed his rival Germanic chieftain at a banquet. \n\nA period of instability then ensued, eventually tempting the [[Byzantine|Eastern Roman]] Emperor [[Justinian]] to declare war on the Ostrogoths in 535 in an effort to restore the former western provinces of the [[Roman Empire]]. Initially, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] were successful, but under the leadership of [[Totila]], the [[Goths]] reconquered most of the lost territory until Totila's death at the [[Battle of Taginae]]. [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|The war]] lasted for almost 21 years and caused enormous damage across Italy, reducing the population of the peninsula. Any remaining Ostrogoths in Italy were absorbed into the [[Lombards]], who established a [[Lombard Kingdom|kingdom]] in Italy in 568.\n\n==The Greuthungi and Ostrogothi==\n[[File:Scandza.PNG|thumb|left|Possible map of [[Scandza]] based on [[Jordanes]]' work]]\n\nAccording to historian Wolfram the first record of a distinctive Gothic group, specifically the [[Tervingi]], was dated from 291.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24, fn52}}{{efn|''[[Panegyrici Latini]]'' XI 17.1 (dated 291)}} The [[Greuthungi]], [[Vesi]], and Ostrogothi are all attested no earlier than 388.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}} The Ostrogoths were first mentioned only one hundred years later in 399, in a poem by [[Claudian]] which describes the Ostrogoths and Greuthungi inhabiting the land of [[Phrygia]] together, ready to be aroused by some small offense and return to their natural ways.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=216\u2013217}}{{efn|Wolfram uses Claudian's, ''Against Eutropius'', as his source here: [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/claudian_claudianus-eutropius/1922/pb_LCL135.197.xml]{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24, 387fn52}}}} Note Wolfram wrongly dates the poem to 392, though it was written after the death of [[Eutropius the consul|Eutropius (consul)]] (died 399).{{clarify|date=April 2020|reason=While this may be correct, this type of refutation of an established scholar requires academic substantiation.

He was an associate of [[Gainas]].}}\n\nBased upon the 6th century writer [[Jordanes]], whose ''[[Getica]]'' is a history of the Ostrogothic [[Amal dynasty]], there is a tradition of equating the [[Greuthungi]] with the Ostrogothi.{{sfn|Heather|1996|pp=52\u201357, 300\u2013301}} Jordanes does not mention the Greuthungi, but he identified the Ostrogothic kings, the [[Amal dynasty]], including [[Theodoric the Great]], as the heirs and descendants of king [[Ermanaric]]. Ermanaric was described by the better and more contemporary writer [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] as a king of the Greuthungi, however the family succession described by the two classical authors is completely in conflict, and Ammianus is considered to be the more reliable source.{{sfn|Christensen|2002}}\n\nAccording to the Jordanes (XVI), around 250 (the time of Emperor [[Philip the Arab]] who reigned 244-249) the Ostrogoths were ruled by a king called [[Ostrogotha]] and they either derived their name from this \"father of the Ostrogoths\", or else the Ostrogoths and Visigoths got these names because they meant eastern and western Goths. Modern historians disagree with Jordanes on the details but there are still historians such as Herwig Wolfram who assert that he was right to believe there was a continuity between the Greuthungi and the later Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}}\n\nWolfram claims the primary sources either use the terminology of Tervingi/Greuthungi or Vesi/Ostrogothi and never mix the pairs.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}} When all four names were used together, the pairing was always preserved, as in the example of Claudian, or the [[Augustan History]] for the Emperor [[Claudius Gothicus]] which has \"''Gruthungi, Ostrogothi, Tervingi, Vesi''\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=202-203}} Wolfram argues that the terms Tervingi and Greuthungi were geographical identifiers used by each tribe to describe the other.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} Historian Thomas Burns agrees with this conclusion.{{sfn|Burns|1984|p=44}} This terminology therefore dropped out of use after the Goths moved into the Roman empire, after about 400.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24\u201325}} In support of this, Wolfram cites [[Zosimus]] as referring to a group of \"Scythians\" north of the [[Danube]] after 376 who were called \"Greuthungi\" by the barbarians.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn57}} In contrast, according to him, the terms \"Vesi\" and \"Ostrogothi\" were used by the peoples themselves to boastfully describe themselves.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} On this understanding, the Greuthungi and Ostrogothi were more or less the same people.{{sfn|Burns|1984|p=44}}\n\nIn general, the terminology of a divided Gothic people disappeared gradually after they entered the Roman Empire. The term \"Visigoth\", however, was an invention of the sixth century. [[Cassiodorus]], a Roman in the service of Theodoric the Great, invented the term ''Visigothi'' to match ''Ostrogothi'', which terms he thought of as \"western Goths\" and \"eastern Goths\" respectively.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} The western-eastern division was a simplification and a literary device of sixth-century historians where political realities were more complex.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} Furthermore, Cassiodorus used the term \"Goths\" to refer only to the Ostrogoths, whom he served, and reserved the geographical term \"Visigoths\" for the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Gallo-Hispanic Goths]]. This usage, however, was adopted by the Visigoths themselves in their communications with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and was in use in the seventh century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}}\n\nOther names for the Goths abounded. A \"Germanic\" Byzantine or Italian author referred to one of the two peoples as the ''Valagothi'', meaning \"Roman [''[[walha]]''] Goths\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} In 484 the Ostrogoths had been called the ''Valameriaci'' (men of Valamir) because they followed Theodoric, a descendant of Valamir.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} This terminology survived in the Byzantine East as late as the reign of [[Athalaric]], who was called ''\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039f\u03c5\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5'' (tou Oualemeriakou) by [[John Malalas]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=389, fn67}}\n\n===Etymology===\n{{see|Greuthungi#Etymology|Goths#Name}}\n[[File:GNM - Gotische Fibeln.jpg|thumb|right|Ostrogothic bow-fibulae (c. 500) from [[Emilia-Romagna]], [[Italy]]]]\n\nThe first part of the word \"Ostrogoth\" comes from a root \"*auster-\" meaning eastern. According to the proposal of Wolfram, this was originally a boastful tribal name meaning \"Goths of the rising sun\", or \"Goths glorified by the rising sun\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=25, 387 fn49, 388 fn58}}{{Efn|Wolfram cites Moritz Sch\u00f6nfeld's (1911) work, ''W\u00f6rterbuch der altgermanischen personen- und V\u00f6lkernamen'' as his principle naming source.

Singularly the most important work amid the surviving Gothic texts is the translation of the Bible by the Visigothic bishop [[Ulfilas]], comprising the earliest remnants of the Germanic languages known.{{sfn|Dalby|1999|p=229}} Smatterings of the Gothic language can be found in Italian but its presence is minimal. A language related to [[Gothic language|Gothic]] was still spoken sporadically in [[Crimea]] as late as the 16th and 17th centuries ([[Crimean Gothic language]]).{{sfn|Dalby|1999|p=229}} Much of the disappearance of the Gothic language is attributable to the Goths' cultural and linguistic absorption by other European peoples during the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=572}}\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\n{{Main article|Chernyakhov culture|Oium|Gothic runic inscriptions}}\n\n[[File:Chernyakhov.PNG|thumb|{{legend|#0f0|Traditional [[G\u00f6taland]]}}\n{{legend|#f08|Island of [[Gotland]]}}\n{{legend|#f00|[[Wielbark Culture]], early 3rd century}}\n{{legend|#f80|[[Chernyakhov culture]], early 4th century}}\n{{legend|#80f|[[Roman Empire]]}}]]\n\nMentioned in several sources up to the third century AD when they apparently split into at least two groups, the [[Greuthungs|Greuthungi]] in the east and [[Thervings|Tervingi]] in the west, the two [[Goths|Gothic]] tribes shared many aspects, especially recognizing a patron deity the Romans named [[Mars (god)|Mars]]. This so-called \"split\" or, more appropriately, resettlement of western tribes into the Roman province of [[Dacia]] was a natural result of population saturation of the area north of the Black Sea. The Goths in Dacia established a vast and powerful kingdom during the third and fourth centuries between the [[Danube]] and the [[Dniepr]] in what is now [[Romania]], [[Moldova]] and western [[Ukraine]]. This was a multi-tribal state ruled by a Gothic elite but inhabited by many other interrelated but multi-tongue tribes including the Iranian-speaking [[Sarmatians]], the Germanic-speaking [[Gepids]], the Thracian-speaking [[Dacians]], other minor [[Celt]]ic and [[Thracians|Thracian]] tribes and possibly early [[Slavs]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/434454/Ostrogoth ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''\u2014Ostrogoths]</ref> Unfortunately the exact geographical dividing line between the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths is not known but in general terms, the Visigoths occupied Dacia, Moldavia and Walachia, whereas the Ostrogoths lived in the steppe regions beyond the [[Dniester River]], ruling over a large confederation of Germanic and [[Scythian]] tribes, covering a vast territory in what is now Ukraine and areas of southern Russia. [[Jordanes]] calls the realm Oium, or Aujum.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=25}}\n\n===Hunnic invasions===\nThe rise of the [[Huns]] around 370 overwhelmed the Gothic kingdoms.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=575}} Many of the Goths migrated into Roman territory in the [[Balkans]], while others remained north of the [[Danube]] under Hunnic rule. Frequently the Ostrogoths fought alongside both Alans and Huns.{{sfn|Todd|1999|p=177}} It was the Ostrogoths who were first subdued by the Huns.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=55}} Like other tribal peoples, they became one of the many Hunnic vassals fighting in Europe, as in the [[Battle of Chalons]] in 451. Several uprisings against the Huns were suppressed. The collapse of Hunnic power in the 450s led to further violent upheaval in the lands north of the Danube, during which the Ostrogoths expanded slowly southwards into the Balkans, and then westwards towards [[Illyria]] and the borders of Italy. Their rule was marked by turmoil with hostile neighbors all around and the land they acquired between Vindobona (Vienna) and Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica) was not well managed, a fact which rendered the Ostrogoths dependent upon Constantinople for subsidies.{{sfn|Todd|1999|p=178}}\n\n===Post-Hunnic movements===\nTheir recorded history begins with their independence from the remains of the Hunnic Empire following the death of [[Attila the Hun]] in 453. Now allied with the Huns' former vassals, the Gepids, the Ostrogoths under [[Theodemir (Ostrogothic king)|Theodemir]] broke the Hunnic power of Attila's sons in the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 454, although the Ostrogoth contribution to the battle's success was minimal.{{sfn|Burns|1984|p=52}}\n\nThe Ostrogoths now entered into relations with the Empire, and were settled on lands in [[Pannonia]], becoming ''foederati'' (federates) to the Byzantines.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=575}} During the greater part of the latter half of the 5th century, the East Goths played in south-eastern Europe nearly the same part that the Western Goths (Visigoths) played in the century before. They were seen going to and from, in every conceivable relation of friendship and enmity with the Eastern Roman power, until, just as the West Goths had done before them, they passed from the East to the West. Unchallenged by the now-dissipated power of the Huns, the Ostrogoths under [[Valamir]] were themselves powerful and absorbed elements from other, smaller tribes, such as the [[Scirii]]. A dispute with the Eastern Roman emperor at Constantinople caused Valamir to lead his Ostrogoths against him. With the barbarians at the gates, Emperor Leo I agreed to pay an annual subsidy of gold.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}}\n\n===Kingdom in Italy===\n{{History of Italy}}\n{{Main article|Ostrogothic Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:Ostrogothic Kingdom.png|right|300px|thumb|Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy]]\n\nThe greatest of all Ostrogothic rulers, the future [[Theodoric the Great]] (whose Gothic name meant \"leader of the people\") of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] (''Regnum Italiae'', \"Kingdom of Italy\"){{efn|See: http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cassiodorus/varia2.shtml Flavius Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus Senator, ''Variae'', Lib. II., XLI. Luduin regi Francorum Theodericus rex}} was born to Theodemir in or about 454, soon after the Battle of Nedao. His childhood was spent at [[Constantinople]] as a diplomatic [[hostage]], where he was carefully educated.{{sfn|Backman|2008|p=68}}  The early part of his life was taken up with various disputes, intrigues and wars within the [[Byzantine empire]], in which he had as his rival [[Theodoric Strabo]] of the [[Thracian Goths]], a distant relative of Theodoric the Great and son of [[Triarius]]. This older but lesser Theodoric seems to have been the chief, not the king, of that branch of the Ostrogoths that had settled within the Empire earlier.  Theodoric the Great, as he is sometimes distinguished, was sometimes the friend, sometimes the enemy, of the Empire.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=575}} In the former case he was clothed with various Roman titles and offices, as [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] and [[consul]]; but in all cases alike he remained the national Ostrogothic king.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}} Theodoric is also known for his attainment of support from the [[Catholic Church]] and on one occasion, he even helped resolve a disputed papal election.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=338}} During his reign, Theodoric, who was an [[Arianism|Arian]], allowed freedom of religion, which had not been done before. However, he did try to appease the [[Pope]] and tried to keep his alliance with the church strong. He saw the Pope as an authority not only in the church but also over Rome itself. His ability to work well with Italy's nobles, members of the Roman Senate, and the Catholic Church all helped facilitate his acceptance as the ruler of Italy.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|pp=338\u2013339}}\n\nTheodoric sought to revive Roman culture and government and in doing so, profited the Italian people.{{sfn|Cantor|1994|p=109}} It was in both characters together that he set out in 488, by commission from the [[Byzantine]] emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], to recover [[Italy]] from [[Odoacer]].  In 489, the [[Rugii]], a Germanic tribe who dwelt in the [[Hungarian Plain]], joined the Ostrogoths in their invasion of Italy under their leader [[Frideric]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=665}} By 493 [[Ravenna]] was taken, where Theodoric would set up his capital. It was also at this time that Odoacer was killed by Theodoric's own hand.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=575\u2013576}} Ostrogothic power was fully established over Italy, [[Sicily]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and the lands to the north of Italy. Around 500, Theodoric celebrated his thirtieth anniversary as King of the Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=178}} In order to improve their chances against the Roman Empire the Ostrogoths and [[Visigoths]] began again to unite in what became a loose confederation of Germanic peoples.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}} The two branches of the nation were soon brought closer together; after he was forced to become regent of the Visigothic kingdom of [[Toulouse]], the power of Theodoric was practically extended over a large part of [[Gaul]] and over nearly the whole of the [[Iberian peninsula]]. Theodoric forged alliances with the Visigoths, Alamanni, Franks and Burgundians, some of which were accomplished through diplomatic marriages.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}}\n\nThe Ostrogothic dominion was once again as far-reaching and splendid as it was in the time of [[Ermanaric|Hermanaric]]; however it was now of a wholly different character. The dominion of Theodoric was not a [[barbarian]] but a [[civilization|civilized]] power. His twofold position ran through everything. He was at once king of the Goths and successor, though without any imperial titles, of the Western [[Roman emperor]]s.  The two nations, differing in manners, language and religion, lived side by side on the soil of Italy; each was ruled according to its own law, by the prince who was, in his two separate characters, the common sovereign of both.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}} Due to his ability to foster and leverage relations among the various Germanic kingdoms, the Byzantines began to fear Theodoric's power, which led to an alliance between the Byzantine emperor and the Frankish king, [[Clovis I]], a pact designed to counteract and ultimately overthrow the Ostrogoths. In some ways Theodoric may have been overly accommodating to both the Romans and other Gothic people as he placated Catholics and Arian Christians alike. Historian Herwig Wolfram suggests that Theodoric's efforts in trying to appease Latin and barbarian cultures in kind brought about the collapse of Ostrogothic predominance and also resulted in the \"end of Italy as the heartland of late antiquity.\"{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=332}} All the years of creating a protective perimeter around Italy were broken down by the Franco-Byzantine coalition. Theodoric was able to temporarily salvage some of his realm with the assistance of the Thuringians.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=218\u2013221}} Realizing that the Franks were the most significant threat to the Visigothic empire as well, Alaric II, (who was the son-in-law of Theodoric) enlisted the aid of the Burgundians and fought against the Franks at the urging of the magnates of his tribe, but this choice proved an error and he allegedly met his end at the hand of the Frankish king, Clovis.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=155}}\n\nA time of confusion followed the death of [[Alaric II]] who was slain during the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]. The Ostrogothic king Theodoric stepped in as the guardian of his grandson [[Amalaric]],{{sfn|Larned|1895|p=134}} and preserved for him all his Iberian and a fragment of his Gallic dominion. Toulouse passed to the [[Franks]] but the Goths kept [[Narbonne]] and its district and [[Septimania]], which was the last part of Gaul held by the Goths, keeping the name of Gothia for many years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} While Theodoric lived, the Visigothic kingdom was practically united to his own dominion. He seems also to have claimed a kind of protectorate over the [[Germany|Germanic]] powers generally, and indeed to have practically exercised it, except in the case of the [[Franks]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} From 508\u2013511 under Theodoric's command, the Ostrogoths marched on Gaul as the Vandal king of Carthage and Clovis made concerted efforts to weaken his hold on the Visigoths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=220}} On the death of Theodoric in 526, the eastern and western Goths were once again divided.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=225}} By the late 6th century, the Ostrogoths lost their political identity and assimilated into other Germanic tribes.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}}\n\n[[File:Theodoric's Palace - Sant'Apollinare Nuovo - Ravenna 2016 (crop).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Mosaic depicting the palace of Theodoric the Great in his palace chapel of [[San Apollinare Nuovo]]]]\n\nThe picture of Theodoric's rule is drawn for us in the state papers drawn up, in his name and in the names of his successors, by his Roman minister [[Cassiodorus]].

The few instances where they acted together after this time are as scattered and incidental as they were before. Amalaric succeeded to the Visigothic kingdom in Iberia and Septimania. Theodoric's grandson [[Athalaric]] took on the mantle as king of the Ostrogoths for the next five years.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=334}} [[Provence]] was added to the dominion of the new Ostrogothic king Athalaric and through his daughter [[Amalasuntha]] who was named regent.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}} Both were unable to settle disputes among Gothic elites.

Atop this infighting, the Ostrogoths faced the doctrinal challenges incurred from their Arian Christianity, which both the aristocracy of Byzantium and the Papacy strongly opposed\u2014so much that it brought them together.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}}\n\nThe weakness of the Ostrogothic position in Italy now showed itself, particularly when Eastern Roman Emperor [[Justinian I]] enacted a law excluding pagans\u2014among them Arian Christians and Jews\u2014from public employment.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}} The Ostrogothic King Theodoric reacted by persecuting Catholics.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}} Nonetheless, Justinian always strove to restore as much of the Western Roman Empire as he could and certainly would not pass up the opportunity. Launched on both land and sea, Justinian began his war of reconquest.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=339}} In 535, he commissioned [[Belisarius]] to attack the Ostrogoths following the success he had in North Africa against the Vandals.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=500\u2013501}} It was Justinian's intention to recover Italy and Rome from the Goths.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=501}}  Belisarius quickly captured Sicily and then crossed into Italy, where he captured Naples and Rome in December of 536. Sometime during the spring of 537, the Goths marched on Rome with upwards of 100,000 men under the leadership of [[Witiges]] and laid siege to the city, albeit unsuccessfully. Despite outnumbering the Romans by a five-to-one margin, the Goths could not loose Belisarius from the former western capital of the Empire.{{sfn|Oman|1902|pp=89\u201390}} After recuperating from siege warfare, Belisarius marched north, taking Mediolanum ([[Milan]]) and the Ostrogoth capital of Ravenna in 540.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=502\u2013503}}\n\nWith the attack on Ravenna, Witiges and his men were trapped in the Ostrogothic capital. Belisarius proved more capable at [[siege warfare]] than his rival Witiges had been at Rome and the Ostrogoth ruler, who was also dealing with Frankish enemies, was forced to surrender, but not without terms. Belisarius refused to grant any concessions save unconditional surrender in view of the fact that Justinian wanted to make Witiges a vassal king in Trans-Padane Italy.{{sfn|Oman|1902|p=91}} This condition made for something of an impasse.\n\n[[File:Totila fa dstruggere la citt\u00e0 di Firenze.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Totila razes the walls of [[Florence]]: illumination from the Chigi manuscript of [[Giovanni Villani|Villani's ''Cronica'']]]]\n\nA faction of the Gothic nobility pointed out that their own king [[Witiges]], who had just lost, was something of a weakling and they would need a new one. [[Eraric]], the leader of the group, endorsed Belisarius and the rest of the kingdom agreed, so they offered him their crown.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=503}}  Belisarius was a soldier, not a statesman, and still loyal to Justinian. He made as if to accept the offer, rode to Ravenna to be crowned, and promptly arrested the leaders of the Goths and reclaimed their entire kingdom\u2014no halfway settlements\u2014for the Empire. Fearful that Belisarius might set himself up a permanent kingship should he consolidate his conquests, Justinian recalled him to Constantinople with Witiges in tow.{{sfn|Bauer|2010|p=208}}\n\nAs soon as Belisarius was gone, the remaining Ostrogoths elected a new king named [[Totila]]. Under the brilliant command of Totila, the Goths were able to reassert themselves to a degree. For a period of nearly ten years, control for Italy became a seesaw battle between Byzantine and Ostrogothic forces.{{sfn|Bauer|2010|p=210}} Totila eventually recaptured all of northern Italy and even drove the Byzantines out of Rome, thereby affording him the opportunity to take political control of the city, partly by executing the Roman senatorial order. Many of them fled eastwards for Constantinople.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=504}}\n\nBy 550 Justinian was able to put together an enormous force, an assembly designed to recover his losses and subdue any Gothic resistance. In 551, the Roman navy destroyed Totila's fleet and in 552 an overwhelming Byzantine force under [[Narses]] entered Italy from the north. Attempting to surprise the invading Byzantines, Totila gambled with his forces at [[Battle of Taginae|Taginaei]], where he was slain.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=504}} Broken but not yet defeated, the Ostrogoths made one final stand at Campania under a chief named Teia, but when he was also killed in battle at [[Nuceria]] they finally capitulated. On surrendering, they informed Narses that evidently \"the hand of God was against them\" and so they left Italy for the northern lands of their fathers.{{sfn|Oman|1902|pp=95\u201396}} After that final defeat, the Ostrogothic name wholly died. The nation had practically evaporated with Theodoric's death. The leadership of western Europe therefore passed by default to the Franks.  Consequently, Ostrogothic failure and Frankish success  were crucial for the development of [[early medieval Europe]], for Theodoric had made it \"his intention to restore the vigor of Roman government and Roman culture\".{{sfn|Cantor|1994|p=105\u2013107}} The chance of forming a national state in Italy by the union of Roman and Germanic elements, such as those that arose in Gaul, in Iberia, and in parts of Italy under Lombard rule, was thus lost. The failures of the barbarian kingdoms to maintain control of the regions they conquered were partly the result of leadership vacuums like those which resulted from the death of Theodoric (also the lack of male succession) and Totila but additionally as a consequence of political fragmentation amid the Germanic tribes as their loyalties wavered between their kin and their erstwhile enemies. Frankish entry onto the geopolitical map of Europe also bears into play:  had the Ostrogoths attained more military success against the Byzantines on the battlefield by combining the strength of other Germanic tribes, this could have changed the direction of Frankish loyalty.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=505\u2013512}} Military success or defeat and political legitimacy were interrelated in barbarian society.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=512}}\n\nNevertheless, according to Roman historian [[Procopius of Caesarea]], the Ostrogothic population was allowed to live peacefully in Italy with their Rugian allies under Roman sovereignty. They later joined the Lombards during their conquest of Italy.{{efn|De Bello Gothico IV 32, pp.&nbsp;241\u2013245.}}\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Orecchini ostrogoti.jpg|thumb|250px|Ostrogoth ear jewels, Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\n\nSurviving Gothic writings in the [[Gothic language]] include the Bible of [[Ulfilas]] and other religious writings and fragments. In terms of Gothic legislation in [[Latin]], we have the [[edict of Theodoric]] from around the year 500, and the ''Variae'' of Cassiodorus, which may also pass as a collection of the state papers of Theodoric and his immediate successors. Among the Visigoths, written laws had already been put forth by [[Euric]]. Alaric II put forth a Breviarium of [[Roman law]] for his Roman subjects; but the great collection of Visigothic laws dates from the later days of the monarchy, being put forth by King [[Reccaswinth]] about 654. This code gave occasion to some well-known comments by Montesquieu and [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]], and has been discussed by Savigny (''Geschichte des r\u00f6mischen Rechts'', ii. 65) and various other writers. They are printed in the ''Monumenta Germaniae, leges'', tome i. (1902).{{sfn|Chisholm|1910|p=275}}\n \nAmid Gothic histories that remain, besides that of the frequently quoted Jordanes, there is the Gothic history of [[Isidore]], archbishop of [[Seville]], a special source of the history of the Visigothic kings down to [[Suinthila]] (621-631). But all the Latin and [[Greek language|Greek]] writers contemporary with the days of Gothic predominance also made their contributions. Not for special facts, but for a general estimate, no writer is more instructive than [[Salvian of Marseilles]] in the 5th century, whose work, ''De Gubernatione Dei'', is full of passages contrasting the vices of the Romans with the virtues of the \"barbarians\", especially of the Goths. In all such pictures one must allow a good deal for exaggeration both ways, but there must be a groundwork of truth. The chief virtues that the [[Roman Catholic]] [[presbyter]] praises in the Arian Goths are their chastity, their piety according to their own creed, their tolerance towards the Catholics under their rule, and their general good treatment of their Roman subjects. He even ventures to hope that such good people may be saved, notwithstanding their [[Christian heresy|heresy]]. This image must have had some basis in truth, but it is not very surprising that the later Visigoths of Iberia had fallen away from Salvian's somewhat idealistic picture.{{sfn|Chisholm|1910|p=275}}\n\n==Ostrogothic rulers==\n===Amal dynasty===\n* [[Valamir]]  r. 447 &ndash; c. 465 \n* [[Theodemir (Ostrogothic king)|Theodemir]] r. c. 465 &ndash; 475\n* [[Theodoric the Great]]  r. 475\u2013526 \n* [[Athalaric]] r. 526\u2013534\n* [[Amalasuntha]], r. 534-535\n* [[Theodahad]] r. 535\u2013536\n\n===Later kings===\n* [[Witiges]] r. 536\u2013540\n* [[Ildibad]] r. 540\u2013541\n* [[Eraric]] r. 541\n* [[Totila]] (also ''Baduila'') r. 541\u2013552  \n* [[Teia|Theia]] (also ''Teia(s)'', ''Teja'')  r. 552\u2013553\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n* [[List of Germanic tribes]]\n* [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]]\n* [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)]]\n* [[Chernyakhov culture]]\n* [[Oium]]\n* [[Wielbark culture]]\n\n== References ==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* [[Patrick Amory|Amory, Patrick]].

In the 5th century, they followed the [[Visigoths]] in creating one of the two great [[Goths|Gothic]] kingdoms within the [[Roman Empire]], based upon the large Gothic populations who had settled in the [[Balkans]] in the 4th century, having crossed the [[Lower Danube]]. While the Visigoths had formed under the leadership of [[Alaric I]], the new Ostrogothic political entity which came to rule Italy, was formed in the Balkans under the influence of the [[Amal Dynasty]].\n\nAs with other Gothic groups, the history of the peoples who made them up before they reached the Roman Balkans is difficult to reconstruct in detail. However, the Ostrogoths are associated with the earlier [[Greuthungi]]. The Ostrogoths themselves were more commonly referred to simply as Goths even in the 5th century, but before then they were referred to once, in a poem by [[Claudian]] which associates them with a group of Greuthungi. Furthermore, the 6th century historian of the Goths Jordanes also equated the Ostrogoths of his time to the Goths ruled by King [[Ermanaric]] in the 4th century, who the Roman writer [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] had called Greuthungi, and described as living between the [[Dniester]] and [[Don river|Don]] rivers. He also mentioned that Ermanaric committed suicide when the [[Huns]] and [[Alans]] attacked his people from the east. After this, the Gothic peoples moved massively into the Roman empire, or became subservient to the Huns.\n\nAfter the death of [[Attila]] and collapse of the [[Hunnic empire]] after the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 453, the [[Amal Dynasty]], the family of   [[Theodoric the Great]] became preeminent, and began to form their kingdom within the Roman Balkans. Eventually, the Emperor [[Zeno]] backed Theoderic to invade Italy and replace [[Odoacer]] there as its king, under imperial authority. In 493 he established the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] of [[Italy]], when Theodoric defeated Odoacer's forces and killed his rival Germanic chieftain at a banquet. \n\nA period of instability then ensued, eventually tempting the [[Byzantine|Eastern Roman]] Emperor [[Justinian]] to declare war on the Ostrogoths in 535 in an effort to restore the former western provinces of the [[Roman Empire]]. Initially, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] were successful, but under the leadership of [[Totila]], the [[Goths]] reconquered most of the lost territory until Totila's death at the [[Battle of Taginae]]. [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|The war]] lasted for almost 21 years and caused enormous damage across Italy, reducing the population of the peninsula. Any remaining Ostrogoths in Italy were absorbed into the [[Lombards]], who established a [[Lombard Kingdom|kingdom]] in Italy in 568.\n\n==The Greuthungi and Ostrogothi==\n[[File:Scandza.PNG|thumb|left|Possible map of [[Scandza]] based on [[Jordanes]]' work]]\n\nAccording to historian Wolfram the first record of a distinctive Gothic group, specifically the [[Tervingi]], was dated from 291.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24, fn52}}{{efn|''[[Panegyrici Latini]]'' XI 17.1 (dated 291)}} The [[Greuthungi]], [[Vesi]], and Ostrogothi are all attested no earlier than 388.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}} The Ostrogoths were first mentioned only one hundred years later in 399, in a poem by [[Claudian]] which describes the Ostrogoths and Greuthungi inhabiting the land of [[Phrygia]] together, ready to be aroused by some small offense and return to their natural ways.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=216\u2013217}}{{efn|Wolfram uses Claudian's, ''Against Eutropius'', as his source here: [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/claudian_claudianus-eutropius/1922/pb_LCL135.197.xml]{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24, 387fn52}}}} Note Wolfram wrongly dates the poem to 392, though it was written after the death of [[Eutropius the consul|Eutropius (consul)]] (died 399).{{clarify|date=April 2020|reason=While this may be correct, this type of refutation of an established scholar requires academic substantiation. What other scholar claims this was written later and based on what exactly?}}{{efn|The poem associates this rebellious \"[[Getic]] squadron (''alae'')\" of Greuthungi in Phrygia with a leader it calls [[Tribigild|Tarbigilus]], who is also mentioned by [[Zosimus]] (as Tribigildus), also there mentioning his barbarian forces based in Phrygia and his rebellion against the eunuch consul Eutropius. He was an associate of [[Gainas]].}}\n\nBased upon the 6th century writer [[Jordanes]], whose ''[[Getica]]'' is a history of the Ostrogothic [[Amal dynasty]], there is a tradition of equating the [[Greuthungi]] with the Ostrogothi.{{sfn|Heather|1996|pp=52\u201357, 300\u2013301}} Jordanes does not mention the Greuthungi, but he identified the Ostrogothic kings, the [[Amal dynasty]], including [[Theodoric the Great]], as the heirs and descendants of king [[Ermanaric]]. Ermanaric was described by the better and more contemporary writer [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] as a king of the Greuthungi, however the family succession described by the two classical authors is completely in conflict, and Ammianus is considered to be the more reliable source.{{sfn|Christensen|2002}}\n\nAccording to the Jordanes (XVI), around 250 (the time of Emperor [[Philip the Arab]] who reigned 244-249) the Ostrogoths were ruled by a king called [[Ostrogotha]] and they either derived their name from this \"father of the Ostrogoths\", or else the Ostrogoths and Visigoths got these names because they meant eastern and western Goths. Modern historians disagree with Jordanes on the details but there are still historians such as Herwig Wolfram who assert that he was right to believe there was a continuity between the Greuthungi and the later Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}}\n\nWolfram claims the primary sources either use the terminology of Tervingi/Greuthungi or Vesi/Ostrogothi and never mix the pairs.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}} When all four names were used together, the pairing was always preserved, as in the example of Claudian, or the [[Augustan History]] for the Emperor [[Claudius Gothicus]] which has \"''Gruthungi, Ostrogothi, Tervingi, Vesi''\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=202-203}} Wolfram argues that the terms Tervingi and Greuthungi were geographical identifiers used by each tribe to describe the other.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} Historian Thomas Burns agrees with this conclusion.{{sfn|Burns|1984|p=44}} This terminology therefore dropped out of use after the Goths moved into the Roman empire, after about 400.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24\u201325}} In support of this, Wolfram cites [[Zosimus]] as referring to a group of \"Scythians\" north of the [[Danube]] after 376 who were called \"Greuthungi\" by the barbarians.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn57}} In contrast, according to him, the terms \"Vesi\" and \"Ostrogothi\" were used by the peoples themselves to boastfully describe themselves.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} On this understanding, the Greuthungi and Ostrogothi were more or less the same people.{{sfn|Burns|1984|p=44}}\n\nIn general, the terminology of a divided Gothic people disappeared gradually after they entered the Roman Empire. The term \"Visigoth\", however, was an invention of the sixth century. [[Cassiodorus]], a Roman in the service of Theodoric the Great, invented the term ''Visigothi'' to match ''Ostrogothi'', which terms he thought of as \"western Goths\" and \"eastern Goths\" respectively.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} The western-eastern division was a simplification and a literary device of sixth-century historians where political realities were more complex.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} Furthermore, Cassiodorus used the term \"Goths\" to refer only to the Ostrogoths, whom he served, and reserved the geographical term \"Visigoths\" for the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Gallo-Hispanic Goths]]. This usage, however, was adopted by the Visigoths themselves in their communications with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and was in use in the seventh century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}}\n\nOther names for the Goths abounded. A \"Germanic\" Byzantine or Italian author referred to one of the two peoples as the ''Valagothi'', meaning \"Roman [''[[walha]]''] Goths\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} In 484 the Ostrogoths had been called the ''Valameriaci'' (men of Valamir) because they followed Theodoric, a descendant of Valamir.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} This terminology survived in the Byzantine East as late as the reign of [[Athalaric]], who was called ''\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039f\u03c5\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5'' (tou Oualemeriakou) by [[John Malalas]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=389, fn67}}\n\n===Etymology===\n{{see|Greuthungi#Etymology|Goths#Name}}\n[[File:GNM - Gotische Fibeln.jpg|thumb|right|Ostrogothic bow-fibulae (c. 500) from [[Emilia-Romagna]], [[Italy]]]]\n\nThe first part of the word \"Ostrogoth\" comes from a root \"*auster-\" meaning eastern. According to the proposal of Wolfram, this was originally a boastful tribal name meaning \"Goths of the rising sun\", or \"Goths glorified by the rising sun\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=25, 387 fn49, 388 fn58}}{{Efn|Wolfram cites Moritz Sch\u00f6nfeld's (1911) work, ''W\u00f6rterbuch der altgermanischen personen- und V\u00f6lkernamen'' as his principle naming source.

Singularly the most important work amid the surviving Gothic texts is the translation of the Bible by the Visigothic bishop [[Ulfilas]], comprising the earliest remnants of the Germanic languages known.{{sfn|Dalby|1999|p=229}} Smatterings of the Gothic language can be found in Italian but its presence is minimal. A language related to [[Gothic language|Gothic]] was still spoken sporadically in [[Crimea]] as late as the 16th and 17th centuries ([[Crimean Gothic language]]).{{sfn|Dalby|1999|p=229}} Much of the disappearance of the Gothic language is attributable to the Goths' cultural and linguistic absorption by other European peoples during the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=572}}\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\n{{Main article|Chernyakhov culture|Oium|Gothic runic inscriptions}}\n\n[[File:Chernyakhov.PNG|thumb|{{legend|#0f0|Traditional [[G\u00f6taland]]}}\n{{legend|#f08|Island of [[Gotland]]}}\n{{legend|#f00|[[Wielbark Culture]], early 3rd century}}\n{{legend|#f80|[[Chernyakhov culture]], early 4th century}}\n{{legend|#80f|[[Roman Empire]]}}]]\n\nMentioned in several sources up to the third century AD when they apparently split into at least two groups, the [[Greuthungs|Greuthungi]] in the east and [[Thervings|Tervingi]] in the west, the two [[Goths|Gothic]] tribes shared many aspects, especially recognizing a patron deity the Romans named [[Mars (god)|Mars]]. This so-called \"split\" or, more appropriately, resettlement of western tribes into the Roman province of [[Dacia]] was a natural result of population saturation of the area north of the Black Sea. The Goths in Dacia established a vast and powerful kingdom during the third and fourth centuries between the [[Danube]] and the [[Dniepr]] in what is now [[Romania]], [[Moldova]] and western [[Ukraine]]. This was a multi-tribal state ruled by a Gothic elite but inhabited by many other interrelated but multi-tongue tribes including the Iranian-speaking [[Sarmatians]], the Germanic-speaking [[Gepids]], the Thracian-speaking [[Dacians]], other minor [[Celt]]ic and [[Thracians|Thracian]] tribes and possibly early [[Slavs]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/434454/Ostrogoth ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''\u2014Ostrogoths]</ref> Unfortunately the exact geographical dividing line between the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths is not known but in general terms, the Visigoths occupied Dacia, Moldavia and Walachia, whereas the Ostrogoths lived in the steppe regions beyond the [[Dniester River]], ruling over a large confederation of Germanic and [[Scythian]] tribes, covering a vast territory in what is now Ukraine and areas of southern Russia. [[Jordanes]] calls the realm Oium, or Aujum.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=25}}\n\n===Hunnic invasions===\nThe rise of the [[Huns]] around 370 overwhelmed the Gothic kingdoms.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=575}} Many of the Goths migrated into Roman territory in the [[Balkans]], while others remained north of the [[Danube]] under Hunnic rule. Frequently the Ostrogoths fought alongside both Alans and Huns.{{sfn|Todd|1999|p=177}} It was the Ostrogoths who were first subdued by the Huns.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=55}} Like other tribal peoples, they became one of the many Hunnic vassals fighting in Europe, as in the [[Battle of Chalons]] in 451. Several uprisings against the Huns were suppressed. The collapse of Hunnic power in the 450s led to further violent upheaval in the lands north of the Danube, during which the Ostrogoths expanded slowly southwards into the Balkans, and then westwards towards [[Illyria]] and the borders of Italy. Their rule was marked by turmoil with hostile neighbors all around and the land they acquired between Vindobona (Vienna) and Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica) was not well managed, a fact which rendered the Ostrogoths dependent upon Constantinople for subsidies.{{sfn|Todd|1999|p=178}}\n\n===Post-Hunnic movements===\nTheir recorded history begins with their independence from the remains of the Hunnic Empire following the death of [[Attila the Hun]] in 453. Now allied with the Huns' former vassals, the Gepids, the Ostrogoths under [[Theodemir (Ostrogothic king)|Theodemir]] broke the Hunnic power of Attila's sons in the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 454, although the Ostrogoth contribution to the battle's success was minimal.{{sfn|Burns|1984|p=52}}\n\nThe Ostrogoths now entered into relations with the Empire, and were settled on lands in [[Pannonia]], becoming ''foederati'' (federates) to the Byzantines.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=575}} During the greater part of the latter half of the 5th century, the East Goths played in south-eastern Europe nearly the same part that the Western Goths (Visigoths) played in the century before. They were seen going to and from, in every conceivable relation of friendship and enmity with the Eastern Roman power, until, just as the West Goths had done before them, they passed from the East to the West. Unchallenged by the now-dissipated power of the Huns, the Ostrogoths under [[Valamir]] were themselves powerful and absorbed elements from other, smaller tribes, such as the [[Scirii]]. A dispute with the Eastern Roman emperor at Constantinople caused Valamir to lead his Ostrogoths against him. With the barbarians at the gates, Emperor Leo I agreed to pay an annual subsidy of gold.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}}\n\n===Kingdom in Italy===\n{{History of Italy}}\n{{Main article|Ostrogothic Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:Ostrogothic Kingdom.png|right|300px|thumb|Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy]]\n\nThe greatest of all Ostrogothic rulers, the future [[Theodoric the Great]] (whose Gothic name meant \"leader of the people\") of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] (''Regnum Italiae'', \"Kingdom of Italy\"){{efn|See: http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cassiodorus/varia2.shtml Flavius Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus Senator, ''Variae'', Lib. II., XLI. Luduin regi Francorum Theodericus rex}} was born to Theodemir in or about 454, soon after the Battle of Nedao. His childhood was spent at [[Constantinople]] as a diplomatic [[hostage]], where he was carefully educated.{{sfn|Backman|2008|p=68}}  The early part of his life was taken up with various disputes, intrigues and wars within the [[Byzantine empire]], in which he had as his rival [[Theodoric Strabo]] of the [[Thracian Goths]], a distant relative of Theodoric the Great and son of [[Triarius]]. This older but lesser Theodoric seems to have been the chief, not the king, of that branch of the Ostrogoths that had settled within the Empire earlier.  Theodoric the Great, as he is sometimes distinguished, was sometimes the friend, sometimes the enemy, of the Empire.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=575}} In the former case he was clothed with various Roman titles and offices, as [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] and [[consul]]; but in all cases alike he remained the national Ostrogothic king.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}} Theodoric is also known for his attainment of support from the [[Catholic Church]] and on one occasion, he even helped resolve a disputed papal election.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=338}} During his reign, Theodoric, who was an [[Arianism|Arian]], allowed freedom of religion, which had not been done before. However, he did try to appease the [[Pope]] and tried to keep his alliance with the church strong. He saw the Pope as an authority not only in the church but also over Rome itself. His ability to work well with Italy's nobles, members of the Roman Senate, and the Catholic Church all helped facilitate his acceptance as the ruler of Italy.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|pp=338\u2013339}}\n\nTheodoric sought to revive Roman culture and government and in doing so, profited the Italian people.{{sfn|Cantor|1994|p=109}} It was in both characters together that he set out in 488, by commission from the [[Byzantine]] emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], to recover [[Italy]] from [[Odoacer]].  In 489, the [[Rugii]], a Germanic tribe who dwelt in the [[Hungarian Plain]], joined the Ostrogoths in their invasion of Italy under their leader [[Frideric]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=665}} By 493 [[Ravenna]] was taken, where Theodoric would set up his capital. It was also at this time that Odoacer was killed by Theodoric's own hand.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=575\u2013576}} Ostrogothic power was fully established over Italy, [[Sicily]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and the lands to the north of Italy. Around 500, Theodoric celebrated his thirtieth anniversary as King of the Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=178}} In order to improve their chances against the Roman Empire the Ostrogoths and [[Visigoths]] began again to unite in what became a loose confederation of Germanic peoples.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}} The two branches of the nation were soon brought closer together; after he was forced to become regent of the Visigothic kingdom of [[Toulouse]], the power of Theodoric was practically extended over a large part of [[Gaul]] and over nearly the whole of the [[Iberian peninsula]]. Theodoric forged alliances with the Visigoths, Alamanni, Franks and Burgundians, some of which were accomplished through diplomatic marriages.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}}\n\nThe Ostrogothic dominion was once again as far-reaching and splendid as it was in the time of [[Ermanaric|Hermanaric]]; however it was now of a wholly different character. The dominion of Theodoric was not a [[barbarian]] but a [[civilization|civilized]] power. His twofold position ran through everything. He was at once king of the Goths and successor, though without any imperial titles, of the Western [[Roman emperor]]s.  The two nations, differing in manners, language and religion, lived side by side on the soil of Italy; each was ruled according to its own law, by the prince who was, in his two separate characters, the common sovereign of both.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}} Due to his ability to foster and leverage relations among the various Germanic kingdoms, the Byzantines began to fear Theodoric's power, which led to an alliance between the Byzantine emperor and the Frankish king, [[Clovis I]], a pact designed to counteract and ultimately overthrow the Ostrogoths. In some ways Theodoric may have been overly accommodating to both the Romans and other Gothic people as he placated Catholics and Arian Christians alike. Historian Herwig Wolfram suggests that Theodoric's efforts in trying to appease Latin and barbarian cultures in kind brought about the collapse of Ostrogothic predominance and also resulted in the \"end of Italy as the heartland of late antiquity.\"{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=332}} All the years of creating a protective perimeter around Italy were broken down by the Franco-Byzantine coalition. Theodoric was able to temporarily salvage some of his realm with the assistance of the Thuringians.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=218\u2013221}} Realizing that the Franks were the most significant threat to the Visigothic empire as well, Alaric II, (who was the son-in-law of Theodoric) enlisted the aid of the Burgundians and fought against the Franks at the urging of the magnates of his tribe, but this choice proved an error and he allegedly met his end at the hand of the Frankish king, Clovis.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=155}}\n\nA time of confusion followed the death of [[Alaric II]] who was slain during the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]. The Ostrogothic king Theodoric stepped in as the guardian of his grandson [[Amalaric]],{{sfn|Larned|1895|p=134}} and preserved for him all his Iberian and a fragment of his Gallic dominion. Toulouse passed to the [[Franks]] but the Goths kept [[Narbonne]] and its district and [[Septimania]], which was the last part of Gaul held by the Goths, keeping the name of Gothia for many years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} While Theodoric lived, the Visigothic kingdom was practically united to his own dominion. He seems also to have claimed a kind of protectorate over the [[Germany|Germanic]] powers generally, and indeed to have practically exercised it, except in the case of the [[Franks]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} From 508\u2013511 under Theodoric's command, the Ostrogoths marched on Gaul as the Vandal king of Carthage and Clovis made concerted efforts to weaken his hold on the Visigoths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=220}} On the death of Theodoric in 526, the eastern and western Goths were once again divided.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=225}} By the late 6th century, the Ostrogoths lost their political identity and assimilated into other Germanic tribes.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}}\n\n[[File:Theodoric's Palace - Sant'Apollinare Nuovo - Ravenna 2016 (crop).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Mosaic depicting the palace of Theodoric the Great in his palace chapel of [[San Apollinare Nuovo]]]]\n\nThe picture of Theodoric's rule is drawn for us in the state papers drawn up, in his name and in the names of his successors, by his Roman minister [[Cassiodorus]]. The Goths seem to have been thick on the ground in northern Italy; in the south they formed little more than garrisons.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2,865}} Meanwhile, the Frankish king Clovis fought protracted wars against various enemies while consolidating his rule, forming the embryonic stages of what would eventually become Medieval Europe.{{sfn|Collins|1999|pp=116\u2013137}}\n\n===War with Byzantium (535\u2013554)===\n{{Main article|Gothic War (535\u2013554)}}\n\n[[File:Theodahad 534 536 Ostrogoth minted in Rome.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Theodahad]] (534-536), minted in [[Rome]] \u2013 he wears the barbaric [[moustache]].]]\n\nAbsent the unifying presence of Theodoric, the Ostrogoths and Visigoths were unable to consolidate their realms despite their common Germanic kinship. The few instances where they acted together after this time are as scattered and incidental as they were before. Amalaric succeeded to the Visigothic kingdom in Iberia and Septimania. Theodoric's grandson [[Athalaric]] took on the mantle as king of the Ostrogoths for the next five years.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=334}} [[Provence]] was added to the dominion of the new Ostrogothic king Athalaric and through his daughter [[Amalasuntha]] who was named regent.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}} Both were unable to settle disputes among Gothic elites. [[Theodahad]], cousin of Amalasuntha and nephew of Theodoric through his sister, took over and slew them;{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=332\u2013333, 337\u2013340}} however the usurping ushered in more bloodshed. Atop this infighting, the Ostrogoths faced the doctrinal challenges incurred from their Arian Christianity, which both the aristocracy of Byzantium and the Papacy strongly opposed\u2014so much that it brought them together.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}}\n\nThe weakness of the Ostrogothic position in Italy now showed itself, particularly when Eastern Roman Emperor [[Justinian I]] enacted a law excluding pagans\u2014among them Arian Christians and Jews\u2014from public employment.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}} The Ostrogothic King Theodoric reacted by persecuting Catholics.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}} Nonetheless, Justinian always strove to restore as much of the Western Roman Empire as he could and certainly would not pass up the opportunity. Launched on both land and sea, Justinian began his war of reconquest.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=339}} In 535, he commissioned [[Belisarius]] to attack the Ostrogoths following the success he had in North Africa against the Vandals.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=500\u2013501}} It was Justinian's intention to recover Italy and Rome from the Goths.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=501}}  Belisarius quickly captured Sicily and then crossed into Italy, where he captured Naples and Rome in December of 536. Sometime during the spring of 537, the Goths marched on Rome with upwards of 100,000 men under the leadership of [[Witiges]] and laid siege to the city, albeit unsuccessfully. Despite outnumbering the Romans by a five-to-one margin, the Goths could not loose Belisarius from the former western capital of the Empire.{{sfn|Oman|1902|pp=89\u201390}} After recuperating from siege warfare, Belisarius marched north, taking Mediolanum ([[Milan]]) and the Ostrogoth capital of Ravenna in 540.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=502\u2013503}}\n\nWith the attack on Ravenna, Witiges and his men were trapped in the Ostrogothic capital. Belisarius proved more capable at [[siege warfare]] than his rival Witiges had been at Rome and the Ostrogoth ruler, who was also dealing with Frankish enemies, was forced to surrender, but not without terms. Belisarius refused to grant any concessions save unconditional surrender in view of the fact that Justinian wanted to make Witiges a vassal king in Trans-Padane Italy.{{sfn|Oman|1902|p=91}} This condition made for something of an impasse.\n\n[[File:Totila fa dstruggere la citt\u00e0 di Firenze.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Totila razes the walls of [[Florence]]: illumination from the Chigi manuscript of [[Giovanni Villani|Villani's ''Cronica'']]]]\n\nA faction of the Gothic nobility pointed out that their own king [[Witiges]], who had just lost, was something of a weakling and they would need a new one. [[Eraric]], the leader of the group, endorsed Belisarius and the rest of the kingdom agreed, so they offered him their crown.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=503}}  Belisarius was a soldier, not a statesman, and still loyal to Justinian. He made as if to accept the offer, rode to Ravenna to be crowned, and promptly arrested the leaders of the Goths and reclaimed their entire kingdom\u2014no halfway settlements\u2014for the Empire. Fearful that Belisarius might set himself up a permanent kingship should he consolidate his conquests, Justinian recalled him to Constantinople with Witiges in tow.{{sfn|Bauer|2010|p=208}}\n\nAs soon as Belisarius was gone, the remaining Ostrogoths elected a new king named [[Totila]]. Under the brilliant command of Totila, the Goths were able to reassert themselves to a degree. For a period of nearly ten years, control for Italy became a seesaw battle between Byzantine and Ostrogothic forces.{{sfn|Bauer|2010|p=210}} Totila eventually recaptured all of northern Italy and even drove the Byzantines out of Rome, thereby affording him the opportunity to take political control of the city, partly by executing the Roman senatorial order. Many of them fled eastwards for Constantinople.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=504}}\n\nBy 550 Justinian was able to put together an enormous force, an assembly designed to recover his losses and subdue any Gothic resistance. In 551, the Roman navy destroyed Totila's fleet and in 552 an overwhelming Byzantine force under [[Narses]] entered Italy from the north. Attempting to surprise the invading Byzantines, Totila gambled with his forces at [[Battle of Taginae|Taginaei]], where he was slain.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=504}} Broken but not yet defeated, the Ostrogoths made one final stand at Campania under a chief named Teia, but when he was also killed in battle at [[Nuceria]] they finally capitulated. On surrendering, they informed Narses that evidently \"the hand of God was against them\" and so they left Italy for the northern lands of their fathers.{{sfn|Oman|1902|pp=95\u201396}} After that final defeat, the Ostrogothic name wholly died. The nation had practically evaporated with Theodoric's death. \"The leadership of western Europe therefore passed by default to the Franks.  Consequently, Ostrogothic failure and Frankish success  were crucial for the development of [[early medieval Europe]], for Theodoric had made it \"his intention to restore the vigor of Roman government and Roman culture\".{{sfn|Cantor|1994|p=105\u2013107}} The chance of forming a national state in Italy by the union of Roman and Germanic elements, such as those that arose in Gaul, in Iberia, and in parts of Italy under Lombard rule, was thus lost. The failures of the barbarian kingdoms to maintain control of the regions they conquered were partly the result of leadership vacuums like those which resulted from the death of Theodoric (also the lack of male succession) and Totila but additionally as a consequence of political fragmentation amid the Germanic tribes as their loyalties wavered between their kin and their erstwhile enemies. Frankish entry onto the geopolitical map of Europe also bears into play:  had the Ostrogoths attained more military success against the Byzantines on the battlefield by combining the strength of other Germanic tribes, this could have changed the direction of Frankish loyalty.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=505\u2013512}} Military success or defeat and political legitimacy were interrelated in barbarian society.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=512}}\n\nNevertheless, according to Roman historian [[Procopius of Caesarea]], the Ostrogothic population was allowed to live peacefully in Italy with their Rugian allies under Roman sovereignty. They later joined the Lombards during their conquest of Italy.{{efn|De Bello Gothico IV 32, pp.&nbsp;241\u2013245.}}\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Orecchini ostrogoti.jpg|thumb|250px|Ostrogoth ear jewels, Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\n\nSurviving Gothic writings in the [[Gothic language]] include the Bible of [[Ulfilas]] and other religious writings and fragments. In terms of Gothic legislation in [[Latin]], we have the [[edict of Theodoric]] from around the year 500, and the ''Variae'' of Cassiodorus, which may also pass as a collection of the state papers of Theodoric and his immediate successors. Among the Visigoths, written laws had already been put forth by [[Euric]]. Alaric II put forth a Breviarium of [[Roman law]] for his Roman subjects; but the great collection of Visigothic laws dates from the later days of the monarchy, being put forth by King [[Reccaswinth]] about 654. This code gave occasion to some well-known comments by Montesquieu and [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]], and has been discussed by Savigny (''Geschichte des r\u00f6mischen Rechts'', ii. 65) and various other writers. They are printed in the ''Monumenta Germaniae, leges'', tome i. (1902).{{sfn|Chisholm|1910|p=275}}\n \nAmid Gothic histories that remain, besides that of the frequently quoted Jordanes, there is the Gothic history of [[Isidore]], archbishop of [[Seville]], a special source of the history of the Visigothic kings down to [[Suinthila]] (621-631). But all the Latin and [[Greek language|Greek]] writers contemporary with the days of Gothic predominance also made their contributions. Not for special facts, but for a general estimate, no writer is more instructive than [[Salvian of Marseilles]] in the 5th century, whose work, ''De Gubernatione Dei'', is full of passages contrasting the vices of the Romans with the virtues of the \"barbarians\", especially of the Goths. In all such pictures one must allow a good deal for exaggeration both ways, but there must be a groundwork of truth. The chief virtues that the [[Roman Catholic]] [[presbyter]] praises in the Arian Goths are their chastity, their piety according to their own creed, their tolerance towards the Catholics under their rule, and their general good treatment of their Roman subjects. He even ventures to hope that such good people may be saved, notwithstanding their [[Christian heresy|heresy]]. This image must have had some basis in truth, but it is not very surprising that the later Visigoths of Iberia had fallen away from Salvian's somewhat idealistic picture.{{sfn|Chisholm|1910|p=275}}\n\n==Ostrogothic rulers==\n===Amal dynasty===\n* [[Valamir]]  r. 447 &ndash; c. 465 \n* [[Theodemir (Ostrogothic king)|Theodemir]] r. c. 465 &ndash; 475\n* [[Theodoric the Great]]  r. 475\u2013526 \n* [[Athalaric]] r. 526\u2013534\n* [[Amalasuntha]], r. 534-535\n* [[Theodahad]] r. 535\u2013536\n\n===Later kings===\n* [[Witiges]] r. 536\u2013540\n* [[Ildibad]] r. 540\u2013541\n* [[Eraric]] r. 541\n* [[Totila]] (also ''Baduila'') r. 541\u2013552  \n* [[Teia|Theia]] (also ''Teia(s)'', ''Teja'')  r. 552\u2013553\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n* [[List of Germanic tribes]]\n* [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]]\n* [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)]]\n* [[Chernyakhov culture]]\n* [[Oium]]\n* [[Wielbark culture]]\n\n== References ==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* [[Patrick Amory|Amory, Patrick]].

Unlike other races, the 2019 Macau Grand Prix was held as a non-championship round of the [[FIA Formula 3 Championship]], and was open to drivers from all Formula Three championships. The race itself was made up of two races: a ten-lap qualifying race that decided the starting [[Glossary of motorsport terms#G|grid]] for the fifteen-lap main event. The 2019 race was the 66th running of the [[Macau Grand Prix]], the 37th for Formula Three cars and the fourth edition of the FIA F3 World Cup.\n\nThe Grand Prix was won by [[MP Motorsport]] driver [[Richard Verschoor]] from fourth position. [[J\u00fcri Vips]] of the [[Hitech Racing|Hitech Grand Prix]] team won the qualification race the day before and led the first seven laps of the main race before Verschoor passed him for first place on the eighth lap. Verschoor blocked Vips' multiple attempts to overtake him to become the first rookie to win the Macau Grand Prix since [[Keisuke Kunimoto]] in the [[2008 Macau Grand Prix|2008 edition]]. He was the first Dutch driver in history to win the event and the second after [[Roberto Moreno]] in 1982 to win the [[New Zealand Grand Prix]] and in Macau. Vips finished second and [[Logan Sargeant]] of the [[Carlin Motorsport|Carlin Buzz Racing]] team was third.\n\n==Background and entry list==\nThe [[Macau Grand Prix]] is a [[Formula Three]] race considered by drivers as a stepping stone to higher [[Motorsport|motor racing]] categories such as [[Formula One]], and is the territory's most prestigious international sporting event.<ref>{{cite

Unlike other races, the 2019 Macau Grand Prix was held as a non-championship round of the [[FIA Formula 3 Championship]], and was open to drivers from all Formula Three championships. The race itself was made up of two races: a ten-lap qualifying race that decided the starting [[Glossary of motorsport terms#G|grid]] for the fifteen-lap main event. The 2019 race was the 66th running of the [[Macau Grand Prix]], the 37th for Formula Three cars and the fourth edition of the FIA F3 World Cup.\n\nThe Grand Prix was won by [[MP Motorsport]] driver [[Richard Verschoor]] from fourth position. [[J\u00fcri Vips]] of the [[Hitech Racing|Hitech Grand Prix]] team won the qualification race the day before and led the first seven laps of the main race before Verschoor passed him for first place on the eighth lap. Verschoor blocked Vips' multiple attempts to overtake him to become the first rookie to win the Macau Grand Prix since [[Keisuke Kunimoto]] in the [[2008 Macau Grand Prix|2008 edition]]. He was the first Dutch driver in history to win the event and the second after [[Roberto Moreno]] in 1982 to win the [[New Zealand Grand Prix]] and in Macau. Vips finished second and [[Logan Sargeant]] of the [[Carlin Motorsport|Carlin Buzz Racing]] team was third.\n\n==Background and entry list==\nThe [[Macau Grand Prix]] is a [[Formula Three]] race considered by drivers as a stepping stone to higher [[Motorsport|motor racing]] categories such as [[Formula One]], and is the territory's most prestigious international sporting event.<ref>{{cite

It first opened in 1966 as 1/4&nbsp;mile (0.4&nbsp;km) and 5/8&nbsp;mile (1.6&nbsp;km) dirt oval (Trico Speedway), which operated until 1967 and 1973, respectively. The facility was reopened and paved in 1983. With a slogan of \"the fastest 3/8-mile race track in America,\" the oval features 19&nbsp;degree banking through the turns and 16&nbsp;degrees on the straightaways creating three distinct grooves making for very fast turns. The aluminum grandstands stretch from Turn 4 all the way down the front straightaway to Turn 1. The speedway closed in 2003, but reopened on March 11, 2006.\n\nSome of the most famous names in [[stock car racing]] have raced at the Orange County Speedway, including [[Dale Earnhardt]], [[Jeff Gordon]], [[Mark Martin]], [[Davey Allison|Davey]] and [[Donnie Allison]], [[Dale Jarrett]], [[Jeff Burton|Jeff]] and [[Ward Burton]], [[Elliott Sadler|Elliott]] and [[Hermie Sadler]], [[Scott Riggs]], [[Michael Waltrip]],  [[Todd Bodine]], [[Kyle Petty]] and [[Bobby Labonte]]. Some more recent notable drivers include [[Timothy Peters]], [[Darrell Wallace, Jr.|Darrell \"Bubba\" Wallace, Jr.]], [[Ryan Blaney]], [[Jeb Burton]], [[Timmy Hill]], [[Ryan Reed]], [[Jesse Little]] and [[Gray Gaulding]]. [[David Pearson (NASCAR driver)|David Pearson]] and [[Glen Wood]] raced at the speedway when it was a dirt track. The track currently runs a regular weekly show on the second and fourth Saturday night of each month, April thru October. The facility also hosts the [[Pro All Star Series|PASS Super Late Model]] series, [[CARS Tour|CARS Super Late Model Tour]] and [[CARS Tour|CARS Late Model Stock Tour]].\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\nOrange County Speedway was built as a horse racing track; it stayed as a horse track from 1857 until 1919, when the first auto race took place. Automobile races were going to be a regular event at the track before being stopped because of [[World War II]]. Three years after the war was over stock car racing started again. The first stock car driver to win on the \u00bd-mile track was Frankie Schneider.\n\nIn 1966, the speedway underwent significant improvement, which is considered the actual launch date of the track. Tt open as a 1/4-mile dirt oval, but soon was increased to 5/8 mile and remained until 1973.\n\nIn 1973, the track hosted one [[NASCAR Grand National East Series]] event.\n\nIn 1983, the speedway underwent more improvements. 19-degree banking was added in the turns and 16-degree banking in straightaways to assured more safety for drivers and exciting on-car movements for fans. At that time the Orange County Speedway became known as \u201cthe fastest 3/8-mile race track in America\".\n\nIn 1983, the [[NASCAR]] Busch Grand National Series (now [[Xfinity Series]]) began running events at the speedway. Orange County Speedway was one of the first tracks in the area to have live televised Busch races; the first was the 1990 Roses Stores 200 on June 9, 1990.\n\nBetween 1986 and 1988, the facility hosted 5 [[NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour]] races. Also, the track hostd 3 [[NASCAR Southeast Series]] events between 1993 and 1999.\n\n[[American Speed Association|ASA National Tour]] ran 2 events at the speedway, between 1998 and 1999. And [[CARS Tour|CARS X-1R Pro Cup Series]] ran 5 races at Orange County Speedway between 1997 and 2014.\n\nAt the start of 21st century, the track was in bad shape and attendance had been falling. Eventually the track was shut down in 2003. Then in March 2006, under a new management team, the track reopened. Volunteers put in time to rehabilitation of the speedway for the opening day. The event was a big success, with a large crowd for the first time in years.\n\n==Major results==\n\n===NASCAR Busch Grand National Series===\nThe [[NASCAR]] Busch Grand National Series (now [[Xfinity Series]]) had 27 races at the speedway from 1983 until 1994.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!

Some more recent notable drivers include [[Timothy Peters]], [[Darrell Wallace, Jr.|Darrell \"Bubba\" Wallace, Jr.]], [[Ryan Blaney]], [[Jeb Burton]], [[Timmy Hill]], [[Ryan Reed]], [[Jesse Little]] and [[Gray Gaulding]]. [[David Pearson (NASCAR driver)|David Pearson]] and [[Glen Wood]] raced at the speedway when it was a dirt track. The track currently runs a regular weekly show on the second and fourth Saturday night of each month, April thru October. The facility also hosts the [[Pro All Star Series|PASS Super Late Model]] series, [[CARS Tour|CARS Super Late Model Tour]] and [[CARS Tour|CARS Late Model Stock Tour]].\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\nOrange County Speedway was built as a horse racing track; it stayed as a horse track from 1857 until 1919, when the first auto race took place. Automobile races were going to be a regular event at the track before being stopped because of [[World War II]]. Three years after the war was over stock car racing started again. The first stock car driver to win on the \u00bd-mile track was Frankie Schneider.\n\nIn 1966, the speedway underwent significant improvement, which is considered the actual launch date of the track. Tt open as a 1/4-mile dirt oval, but soon was increased to 5/8 mile and remained until 1973.\n\nIn 1973, the track hosted one [[NASCAR Grand National East Series]] event.\n\nIn 1983, the speedway underwent more improvements. 19-degree banking was added in the turns and 16-degree banking in straightaways to assured more safety for drivers and exciting on-car movements for fans. At that time the Orange County Speedway became known as \u201cthe fastest 3/8-mile race track in America\".\n\nIn 1983, the [[NASCAR]] Busch Grand National Series (now [[Xfinity Series]]) began running events at the speedway. Orange County Speedway was one of the first tracks in the area to have live televised Busch races; the first was the 1990 Roses Stores 200 on June 9, 1990.\n\nBetween 1986 and 1988, the facility hosted 5 [[NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour]] races. Also, the track hostd 3 [[NASCAR Southeast Series]] events between 1993 and 1999.\n\n[[American Speed Association|ASA National Tour]] ran 2 events at the speedway, between 1998 and 1999. And [[CARS Tour|CARS X-1R Pro Cup Series]] ran 5 races at Orange County Speedway between 1997 and 2014.\n\nAt the start of 21st century, the track was in bad shape and attendance had been falling. Eventually the track was shut down in 2003. Then in March 2006, under a new management team, the track reopened. Volunteers put in time to rehabilitation of the speedway for the opening day. The event was a big success, with a large crowd for the first time in years.\n\n==Major results==\n\n===NASCAR Busch Grand National Series===\nThe [[NASCAR]] Busch Grand National Series (now [[Xfinity Series]]) had 27 races at the speedway from 1983 until 1994.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!

Ingram never raced again in the Busch series.\n\n*1994 Pantry Stores 300 - The last Busch series race at Orange County Speedway. Some confusion arose at the end of the race on who had won. With two laps to go George Crenshaw blew his engine and poured oil on the track. Two of the leaders, [[Hermie Sadler]] and 3rd place [[Ricky Craven]], got into the oil and spun out. Sadler recovered, but was passed for the lead by [[Dennis Setzer]], who had moved into 2nd place, and took the white flag as the caution was displayed. NASCAR determined that Sadler had already taken the caution flag, declaring Sadler as the winner.\n\n==Track champions==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Year\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Late Model champion\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Limited Sportsman champion\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Pure Stock champion \n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Street Stocks champion\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Super Mini-Trucks champion \n|-\n| 1983\n| Roy Hendrick\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 1984\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| Phillip Walker\n| x\n|-\n| 1985\n| David Blankenship\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 1986\n| Wayne Patterson\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 1987\n| Wayne Patterson\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 1988\n| Jay Fogleman\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 1989\n| Gilbert Hill\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| x\n|-\t\n| 1990\n| Maurice Hill\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 1991\n| [[Barry Beggarly]]\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 1992\n| Wayne Patterson\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 1993\n| [[Barry Beggarly]]\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 1994\n| [[Barry Beggarly]]\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 1995\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 1996\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 1997\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 1998\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 1999\n| x\n| Donald Brace\n| x\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 2000\n| [[Barry Beggarly]]\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 2001\n| Frank Deiny, Jr.\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 2002\n| [[Timothy Peters]]\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 2003\n| [[Timothy Peters]]\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 2004-2005\n| Track Closed\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 2006\n| Ronald Hill\n| Matt Lofton\n| Chuck Watkins\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 2007\n| Terry Dease\n| x\n| Thomas Penny\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 2008\n| Stacy Puryear\n| Donald Brace\n| x\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 2009\n| David Triplett Jr.\n| Michael McGuire\n| Keith Langston\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 2010\n| Terry Dease\n| Justin Newlin\n| Jarrett Milam\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 2013\n| Craig Moore\n| Jerry Hinesley\n| Jarret Milam\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 2014\n| Chris Denny\n| x\n| x\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 2015\n| x\n| x\n| Danny Winstead\n| x\n| x\n|-\n| 2016\n| Terry Dease\n| Boo Boo Dalton\n| Danny Winstead\n| Jared Gillis\n| John Comstock\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of NASCAR race tracks]]\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|title=The History of America's Speedways: Past & Present|edition=Third|last=Brown|first=Alan E.|year=2003|publisher=Brown|location=Comstock Park, MI|isbn=0-931105-61-7|page=528}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.visitnc.com/tools_search_detail.asp?Propertyid=36930|title=Orange County Speedway|accessdate=2008-07-13|publisher=VisitNC.com|date=2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.ocstrack.com/ocs1_002.htm |title=Track Facts |accessdate=2008-07-13 |publisher=Orange County Speedway |date=2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625095836/http://www.ocstrack.com/ocs1_002.htm |archivedate=2008-06-25 |url-status=dead }}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website}}\n*[http://www.racing-reference.info/tracks/Orange_County_Speedway Orange County Speedway race results] at Racing-Reference\n\n{{NASCAR Nationwide Series racetracks}}\n{{CARS Tour racetracks}}\n{{PASS Super Late Model Series racetracks}}\n{{NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour racetracks}}\n{{NASCAR Elite Division Southeast racetracks}}\n{{ASA National Tour racetracks}}\n{{CARS Pro Cup racetracks}}\n{{CARS Tour racetracks}}\n{{Triangle sports venues}}\n\n[[Category:Sports venues in Orange County, North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Motorsport venues in North Carolina]]\n[[Category:NASCAR tracks]]\n[[Category:1966 establishments in North Carolina]]\n", "name_user": "Luks25", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County_Speedway"}

She is most commonly referred to as Nellie, although Amelia, Margery, Maggie, Sarah, Shirley, Wilhemina and Claudetta are other names she has been given.<ref>Robert L.Mack (2007). ''The Wonderful and Surprising History of Sweeney Todd: The Life and Times of an Urban Legend''. p. 307. Bloomsbury Academic.</ref> A baker from London, Mrs. Lovett is an accomplice and business partner of [[Sweeney Todd]], a barber/serial killer from [[Fleet Street]]. She makes [[meat pies]] from Todd\u2019s victims. \n\nFirst appearing in the Victorian [[penny dreadful]] serial ''[[The String of Pearls]]'', it is debated if she was based on an actual person or not.<ref>{{cite web| work=Crimelibrary.com| title=Sweeney Todd: Fresh Meat Pies| url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/todd/pies_7.html| accessdate=20 February 2008| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410065452/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/todd/pies_7.html| archivedate=10 April 2008}}</ref> The character also appears in modern media related to ''Sweeney Todd'' including the [[Stephen Sondheim]] [[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street|musical]] and its 2007 [[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|film adaptation]].\n\n== Character overview ==\nIn every version of the story in which she appears, Mrs. Lovett is the business partner and accomplice of barber/[[serial killer]] [[Sweeney Todd]]; in some versions, she is also his lover. She makes and sells [[meat pie]]s made from Todd's victims.\n\nWhile in most versions of the Sweeney Todd story Mrs. Lovett's past history is not stated, usually she is depicted as a childless widow, although in some depictions (but very rarely) Mr. Albert Lovett is shown. In Christopher Bond's play and Stephen Sondheim's musical, before she goes into business with Todd she is on the verge of [[poverty]], with her premises being filthy and infested with [[vermin]], and laments her pies are the worst ones in [[London]]. While she feels no remorse about having people killed and serving them as pies, she is sometimes shown to have a softer side to those in need; for example, in the Bond play and Sondheim musical, she informally adopts the young orphan [[Tobias Ragg]] as her own and considers taking in Todd's daughter [[Johanna Barker|Johanna]] as well. In the original \"penny dreadful\" serial and George Dibdin Pitt's stage play, this softer side does not extend to her bakehouse assistants, who are imprisoned in the bakehouse and often slaved to death.\n\n== Various interpretations ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2019}}\n\nAlthough Mrs. Lovett's character and role in the story are similar in each version, certain details vary according to the story's interpretation. In some versions, for example, Mrs. Lovett commits [[suicide]] when their crimes are discovered, while in others, Todd kills her himself or she is arrested and escapes execution by [[turn state's evidence|turning King's Evidence]] against Todd. Her physical appearance varies from a slim and alluring beauty, to a plump, homely [[lunatic]]. Her age is also differing in many adaptations; though it is never specifically stated in any versions, there are some (most noticeably in Sondheim's musical) where she is older than Todd, often by a difference of over fifteen years and others where she is around his age. Whether their relationship is [[platonic love|platonic]], [[romantic love|romantic]] or merely [[human sexual activity|sexual]] also varies according to interpretation.<ref>{{cite web| work=Crimelibrary.com| title=Sweeney Todd: Margery Cheats the Hangman| url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/todd/margery_9.html| accessdate=19 May 2008| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410052955/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/todd/margery_9.html| archivedate=10 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| work=Crimelibrary.com| title=Sweeney Todd: The Trial of Sweeney Todd \u2014 The Defense| url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/todd/defense_9.html| accessdate=19 May 2008| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410052945/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/todd/defense_9.html| archivedate=10 April 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Role in the musical ==\nIn [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s 1979 stage musical ''[[Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'' and [[Tim Burton]]'s [[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|2007 film adaptation]], Todd pays a visit to Mrs. Lovett's pie shop below his old home after 15 years in [[exile]], seeking information about his lost family. Mrs. Lovett recognizes him as her former [[leasehold estate|tenant]], Benjamin Barker, with whom she was (and is) secretly in love. She informs him that his wife, [[Lucy Barker|Lucy]], was [[rape]]d by [[Judge Turpin]], who had exiled Todd on a false charge, and informs Todd that Lucy was so distraught that she poisoned herself with [[arsenic]]. Seeking vengeance, Todd reopens his shaving parlour above the shop, and slits the throats of his customers. Mrs. Lovett initiates a plan for Todd to send the corpses of his victims down a chute that leads to her bakehouse. She then uses the flesh to bake meat pies, which make her business very successful.\n\nShe and Todd take in an orphan, [[Tobias Ragg]], to whom she becomes like a mother. She also dreams of marrying Todd, who is completely uninterested in her.\n\nIn the story's [[climax (narrative)|climactic]] \"Final Sequence\", Todd murders Beadle Bamford, Turpin and a beggar woman, and discovers that the latter is actually Lucy. Todd confronts Mrs. Lovett, who confesses that Lucy survived drinking the poison but was driven [[insane]], reduced to begging. Todd then demands why Mrs. Lovett lied to him, to which Mrs. Lovett then confesses her love for him, and promises she would be a better wife than Lucy ever was. Todd pretends to forgive her, but later throws her into the furnace, burning her alive as retribution for her lies. However, killing Lovett proves to be Todd's fatal mistake; Tobias, who loved her like a mother, emerges from hiding and kills Todd by slitting his throat with his own razor.\n\nSondheim based his characterization of Mrs. Lovett in large part upon the Utilitarian ideas criticized by [[Charles Dickens]] in his novel ''[[Hard Times (novel)|Hard Times]]'', specifically in relation to the character of Mr. Thomas Gradgrind in the Dickens novel, who embodies the Utilitarian ideas and who takes pride in frequently referring to himself as \"eminently practical,\" which Dickens emphasizes to be the character's primary character trait on numerous occasions. This is evidenced by the following: first, on two occasions in Sondheim's musical, Sweeney refers to Mrs. Lovett as \"eminently practical\" when praising her cold-blooded resourcefulness in relation to her meat pie recipes (which are logically Utilitarian in nature); and second, Mrs. Lovett concludes her opening number by stating twice that \"Times is hard,\" a thinly veiled reference to the title of the Dickens novel.\n\n== Portrayals ==\nIn film and stage adaptations of the Sweeney Todd story, Lovett is considered the female lead.\n\n*[[Christine Baranski]] received positive reviews opposite [[Brian Stokes Mitchell]] in the [[John F.

She is most commonly referred to as Nellie, although Amelia, Margery, Maggie, Sarah, Shirley, Wilhemina and Claudetta are other names she has been given.<ref>Robert L.Mack (2007). ''The Wonderful and Surprising History of Sweeney Todd: The Life and Times of an Urban Legend''. p. 307. Bloomsbury Academic.</ref> A baker from London, Mrs. Lovett is an accomplice and business partner of [[Sweeney Todd]], a barber/serial killer from [[Fleet Street]]. She makes [[meat pies]] from Todd\u2019s victims. \n\nFirst appearing in the Victorian [[penny dreadful]] serial ''[[The String of Pearls]]'', it is debated if she was based on an actual person or not.<ref>{{cite web| work=Crimelibrary.com| title=Sweeney Todd: Fresh Meat Pies| url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/todd/pies_7.html| accessdate=20 February 2008| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410065452/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/todd/pies_7.html| archivedate=10 April 2008}}</ref> The character also appears in modern media related to ''Sweeney Todd'' including the [[Stephen Sondheim]] [[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street|musical]] and its 2007 [[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|film adaptation]].\n\n== Character overview ==\nIn every version of the story in which she appears, Mrs. Lovett is the business partner and accomplice of barber/[[serial killer]] [[Sweeney Todd]]; in some versions, she is also his lover. She makes and sells [[meat pie]]s made from Todd's victims.\n\nWhile in most versions of the Sweeney Todd story Mrs. Lovett's past history is not stated, usually she is depicted as a childless widow, although in some depictions (but very rarely) Mr. Albert Lovett is shown. In Christopher Bond's play and Stephen Sondheim's musical, before she goes into business with Todd she is on the verge of [[poverty]], with her premises being filthy and infested with [[vermin]], and laments her pies are the worst ones in [[London]]. While she feels no remorse about having people killed and serving them as pies, she is sometimes shown to have a softer side to those in need; for example, in the Bond play and Sondheim musical, she informally adopts the young orphan [[Tobias Ragg]] as her own and considers taking in Todd's daughter [[Johanna Barker|Johanna]] as well. In the original \"penny dreadful\" serial and George Dibdin Pitt's stage play, this softer side does not extend to her bakehouse assistants, who are imprisoned in the bakehouse and often slaved to death.\n\n== Various interpretations ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2019}}\n\nAlthough Mrs. Lovett's character and role in the story are similar in each version, certain details vary according to the story's interpretation. In some versions, for example, Mrs. Lovett commits [[suicide]] when their crimes are discovered, while in others, Todd kills her himself or she is arrested and escapes execution by [[turn state's evidence|turning King's Evidence]] against Todd. Her physical appearance varies from a slim and alluring beauty, to a plump, homely [[lunatic]]. Her age is also differing in many adaptations; though it is never specifically stated in any versions, there are some (most noticeably in Sondheim's musical) where she is older than Todd, often by a difference of over fifteen years and others where she is around his age. Whether their relationship is [[platonic love|platonic]], [[romantic love|romantic]] or merely [[human sexual activity|sexual]] also varies according to interpretation.<ref>{{cite web| work=Crimelibrary.com| title=Sweeney Todd: Margery Cheats the Hangman| url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/todd/margery_9.html| accessdate=19 May 2008| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410052955/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/todd/margery_9.html| archivedate=10 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| work=Crimelibrary.com| title=Sweeney Todd: The Trial of Sweeney Todd \u2014 The Defense| url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/todd/defense_9.html| accessdate=19 May 2008| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410052945/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/todd/defense_9.html| archivedate=10 April 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Role in the musical ==\nIn [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s 1979 stage musical ''[[Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'' and [[Tim Burton]]'s [[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|2007 film adaptation]], Todd pays a visit to Mrs. Lovett's pie shop below his old home after 15 years in [[exile]], seeking information about his lost family. Mrs. Lovett recognizes him as her former [[leasehold estate|tenant]], Benjamin Barker, with whom she was (and is) secretly in love. She informs him that his wife, [[Lucy Barker|Lucy]], was [[rape]]d by [[Judge Turpin]], who had exiled Todd on a false charge, and informs Todd that Lucy was so distraught that she poisoned herself with [[arsenic]]. Seeking vengeance, Todd reopens his shaving parlour above the shop, and slits the throats of his customers. Mrs. Lovett initiates a plan for Todd to send the corpses of his victims down a chute that leads to her bakehouse. She then uses the flesh to bake meat pies, which make her business very successful.\n\nShe and Todd take in an orphan, [[Tobias Ragg]], to whom she becomes like a mother. She also dreams of marrying Todd, who is completely uninterested in her.\n\nIn the story's [[climax (narrative)|climactic]] \"Final Sequence\", Todd murders Beadle Bamford, Turpin and a beggar woman, and discovers that the latter is actually Lucy. Todd confronts Mrs. Lovett, who confesses that Lucy survived drinking the poison but was driven [[insane]], reduced to begging. Todd then demands why Mrs. Lovett lied to him, to which Mrs. Lovett then confesses her love for him, and promises she would be a better wife than Lucy ever was. Todd pretends to forgive her, but later throws her into the furnace, burning her alive as retribution for her lies. However, killing Lovett proves to be Todd's fatal mistake; Tobias, who loved her like a mother, emerges from hiding and kills Todd by slitting his throat with his own razor.\n\nSondheim based his characterization of Mrs. Lovett in large part upon the Utilitarian ideas criticized by [[Charles Dickens]] in his novel ''[[Hard Times (novel)|Hard Times]]'', specifically in relation to the character of Mr. Thomas Gradgrind in the Dickens novel, who embodies the Utilitarian ideas and who takes pride in frequently referring to himself as \"eminently practical,\" which Dickens emphasizes to be the character's primary character trait on numerous occasions. This is evidenced by the following: first, on two occasions in Sondheim's musical, Sweeney refers to Mrs. Lovett as \"eminently practical\" when praising her cold-blooded resourcefulness in relation to her meat pie recipes (which are logically Utilitarian in nature); and second, Mrs. Lovett concludes her opening number by stating twice that \"Times is hard,\" a thinly veiled reference to the title of the Dickens novel.\n\n== Portrayals ==\nIn film and stage adaptations of the Sweeney Todd story, Lovett is considered the female lead.\n\n*[[Christine Baranski]] received positive reviews opposite [[Brian Stokes Mitchell]] in the [[John F.

After a partial course at [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Hobart College]] he entered the [[University of Minnesota]] in the sophomore class in 1893, graduating with the degree of A.B. in 1896. He then went to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], where he studied during the winter of 1896-1897. The next three years were spent in the offices of [[Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge]], [[Edmund M. Wheelwright|Wheelwright & Haven]], and others. He was married in 1900 and went at once to Paris, where he entered the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts]] in May, 1901 where he became a member of the Atelier Pascal. In October, 1904, he returned to the United States, but he had completed his work at the Ecole. Arriving in Minneapolis, he was almost immediately offered a commission and at once started in on private practice, not having an opportunity to return to Paris for over eight years. As time went on he realized the importance in architectural work of the allied science of engineering in all its branches, and in September, 1910, he formed a partnership with Edwin Brown under the name of Hewitt & Brown, architects and engineers. Hewitt was instrumental in the work which culminated in the completion of the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]]. He was president of the Minnesota State Art Society. He became a member of the American Institute of Architects in 1913, and was president of the Minnesota Chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects]].<ref name=\"Urban1915\">{{cite book|author=Urban America (Organization)|title=Architectural forum: the magazine of building|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=godHAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA179|accessdate=16 August 2011|edition=Now in the public domain.|year=1915|publisher=Time Inc.|pages=179\u2013}}</ref>  The practice of Hewitt and Brown continued until Brown's death in 1930.

After a partial course at [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Hobart College]] he entered the [[University of Minnesota]] in the sophomore class in 1893, graduating with the degree of A.B. in 1896. He then went to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], where he studied during the winter of 1896-1897. The next three years were spent in the offices of [[Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge]], [[Edmund M. Wheelwright|Wheelwright & Haven]], and others. He was married in 1900 and went at once to Paris, where he entered the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts]] in May, 1901 where he became a member of the Atelier Pascal. In October, 1904, he returned to the United States, but he had completed his work at the Ecole. Arriving in Minneapolis, he was almost immediately offered a commission and at once started in on private practice, not having an opportunity to return to Paris for over eight years. As time went on he realized the importance in architectural work of the allied science of engineering in all its branches, and in September, 1910, he formed a partnership with Edwin Brown under the name of Hewitt & Brown, architects and engineers. Hewitt was instrumental in the work which culminated in the completion of the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]]. He was president of the Minnesota State Art Society. He became a member of the American Institute of Architects in 1913, and was president of the Minnesota Chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects]].<ref name=\"Urban1915\">{{cite book|author=Urban America (Organization)|title=Architectural forum: the magazine of building|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=godHAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA179|accessdate=16 August 2011|edition=Now in the public domain.|year=1915|publisher=Time Inc.|pages=179\u2013}}</ref>  The practice of Hewitt and Brown continued until Brown's death in 1930.  Hewitt resumed private practice, but as business declined during the [[Great Depression]], he closed his office and became the chief architectural supervisor for the [[Federal Housing Administration]] for the Minneapolis area.

The novel was released worldwide on 7 September 2017.\n\n== Plot ==\nLisbeth Salander is serving a two month jail sentence for the crimes she committed while protecting August Balder. After threats arise against her, she is transferred to maximum security Flodberga Prison, which she finds rife with corruption. She also discovers that Bangladeshi prisoner Faria Kasi is tormented nightly by ruthless prisoner Beatrice \"Benito\" Andersson.\n\nOne day, Salander is visited by former guardian Holger Palmgren. During their conversation, Palmgren tells her about a visit he received from a former secretary from St Stefan's, where she was committed as a child, who gave him Salander's medical files which has led him to believe she was involved in something called the Registry. Suspicious, Salander forces the Warden to let her use his computer, where she learns the Registry is a secret project that places exceptional children in specific environments to test the effects on their growth.\n\nUnable to do anything from prison, Salander asks journalist Mikael Blomkvist to investigate in her stead, pointing him to wealthy businessman Leo Mannheimer, whose name was in the Registry file she found. During his investigation, Blomkvist learns that Mannheimer had been acting strangely lately and comes to suspect that not only does he have a twin, Dan Brody, but Brody has been going around pretending to be Mannheimer.\n\nMeanwhile Palmgren, while going through Salander's file, recognizes the name Martin Steinberg and calls him. Steinberg panics and contacts his associate Rakel Greitz who, despite dying from stomach cancer, enters Palmgren's house pretending to be a nurse, poisons him and takes the file. Blomkvist arrives too late to save him, but Palmgren tells him to find Hilda von Kanterborg, a former Registry agent whose initials were in the file, before he dies.\n\nBlomkvist tracks Hilda down and, though she doesn't believe Dan stole Leo's identity, she confirms that they are twins. She also tells him that Greitz tried to take Salander away from her family as a child as part of the experiment, only for her to react violently and escape. What they don't know is she then hid in a church and saw a statue of a dragon being slain, which inspired her to fight against the unjust and later don her dragon tattoo.\n\nBlomkvist then confronts Mannheimer who, after saving him from Greitz' henchman Benjamin, reveals that he is Dan. Having grown up on a farm with an abusive adopted father, Dan found a passion for music and eventually fled to America, where he lived as a jazz musician. After being mistaken for Leo by a co-worker, he saw that they looked alike and came to Sweden to find him. After spending time together, they angrily confronted Greitz together for answers. Unfortunately, she and Benjamin caught them off guard and poisoned Leo, blackmailing Dan into burying him and taking his identity. However, Dan secretly managed to save his brother's life and help him escape. They ended taking each other's identity, with Leo living in America, while plotting revenge.\n\nWhile this is happening, the Warden of Flodberga makes plans to transfer Benito to another prison. Upon learning this, Benito prepares to kill Faria, which she reveals she was hired to do by Faria's brothers. However, Salander stops and severely injures her, sending her to the hospital.\n\nAfter she is released, Salander, with the help of Blomkvist's sister Annika, looks into Faria's history: she had been treated as a slave and object by her highly religious older brothers Bashir and Ahmed, who planned on selling her into marriage with a rich man. That fell apart when she fell in love with Jamal Chowdhury, a Bangladeshi national who was branded a heretic by Islamist extremists. Salander soon discovers that, on the two older brothers' orders, younger brother Khalil murdered Jamal, leading to Faria pushing Ahmed to his death in anger, resulting in her arrest and Bashir hiring Benito.\n\nSalander tricks Bashir into confessing on video, and convinces Khalil to do the same to the police after Bashir flees. She then plans to go after Greitz when Blomkvist tells her what he's found, only to be kidnapped by Bashir and an escaped Benito. She gets an alert out to her hacker allies, who manage to track the truck they're in and alert the police. With Faria's help, the police find them just as Salander escapes and arrest Benito, Bashir, and their colleagues. After recovering from a wound sustained in her escape, Salander confronts and subdues Greitz and Benjamin, deciding to spare the former so she can suffer the shame of her reputation being ruined as she's arrested.\n\nFaria's charges are lowered and she's presumably released. The people, Steinberg included, involved are sent to prison and, though preempted by a stock market crash, Millennium publishes Leo and Dan's story. Everyone who knew Palmgren gather for his funeral, where Salander makes a passionate, if backhanded, speech about her guardian.\n\n== Reception ==\nA review by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' says ''The Girl Who Takes an Eye for an Eye'' \"intensifies the mythic elements of Larsson's vision\" and is entertaining.<ref name=\"Washington Post\">{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/lisbeth-salander-is-back-in-the-girl-who-takes-an-eye-for-an-eye/2017/09/09/f6a1c808-93f1-11e7-89fa-bb822a46da5b_story.html | title = Lisbeth Salander is back in \u2018The Girl Who Takes an Eye for an Eye\u2019 | last = Corrigan | first = Maureen | date = 11 September 2017 | work = [[The Washington Post]] | access-date = 15 September 2017 | url-status = live }}</ref> However, ''[[The Guardian]]'' says that \"There is a sluggishness to the plotting and much of the tension relies on orchestrated interruptions and delays, which irritate\".<ref name=\"The Guardian\"/>  The review in ''[[USA Today]]'' calls Salander a fascinating character, and warns potential readers the reviewer thought she was not present for too much of the novel.<ref name=UsaToday2017-09-07/>  [[Paste (magazine)|''Paste'' magazine]]'s review also noted the relative absence of Salander, asserting that Lagercrantz seemed to prefer focusing on new characters that he invented.<ref name=Paste/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=UsaToday2017-09-07>\n{{cite news \n| url         = https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2017/09/07/fascinating-lisbeth-salander-back-eye-although-too-often-m-i-a/635260001/\n| title       = Fascinating Lisbeth Salander is back in 'Eye,' although too often M.I.A.\n| work        = [[USA Today]]\n| author      = Patrick Ryan\n| date        = 2017-09-07\n| accessdate  = 2017-10-22\n| url-status     = live \n| quote       = That Salander feels like an afterthought is the most frustrating thing about the exhaustingly titled Eye (Knopf, 368 pp., *** out of four stars, on sale Sept. 12), which otherwise delivers an engrossing, if low-stakes, mystery.\n}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Paste>\n{{cite news \n| url         = https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/09/the-girl-who-takes-an-eye-for-an-eye-david-lagercr.html\n| title       = Lisbeth Salander's Saga Continues in The Girl Who Takes an Eye for an Eye\n| work        = [[Paste magazine]]\n| author      = Eric Swedlund\n| date        = 2017-09-12\n| accessdate  = 2017-10-22\n| url-status     = live \n| quote       = Like The Girl in the Spider\u2019s Web, this book is a worthy successor to Larsson\u2019s trilogy.
