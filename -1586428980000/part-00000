He was born in Claines, near [[Worcester]], the son of James Dyson Perrins, the owner of the [[Lea & Perrins]] [[Worcestershire sauce]] factory and the grandson of [[William Henry Perrins|William Perrins]], co-originator of the Lea & Perrins secret recipe.\n\nHe was educated at [[Charterhouse School]] and [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], and then served in the [[Highland Light Infantry]]. After the death of his father, he took over management of Lea & Perrins. His father had also been a director of [[Royal Worcester|Royal Worcester Porcelain Factory]], and Charles followed him, becoming a director in 1891. He became chairman in 1901, and supported the factory financially. He bought the company outright in 1934 and ensured its continuity from his own fortune, until it could be taken public in 1954.\n\nIn 1927, he purchased the Royal Worcester Porcelain Factory's historic ceramics collection for a price above market value, to assist the firm's cashflow. In 1946, he established the Perrins Trust to unite the factory museum collection and his own private holdings of Royal Worcester and ensure their survival. After his death, his widow established the \"Dyson Perrins Museum\" at the factory site to house the collection. It is now called \"[[The Museum of Royal Worcester]]\" (previously \"Worcester Porcelain Museum\").\n\nPerrins lived in [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]] for most of his life and amongst his many charitable deeds in [[Worcestershire]] was the endowment of [[Dyson Perrins Church of England Academy]] in Malvern. He served as [[Mayor of Worcester]] for 1897\u201398 and as [[High Sheriff of Worcestershire]] for 1899\u20131900.\n\nHe was a major benefactor of the [[Royal Grammar School, Worcester]], and endowed new buildings including Perrins Hall (1914) named after his father, an [[Old Boys|old boy]]. The school organ is in this building and is played regularly at assemblies.<ref>{{Citation|title=School's Halls|newspaper= The RGS Times, Celebration Edition| date=October 2018|url=https://www.rgsw.org.uk/worcester/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/10/Newspaper.pdf|access-date = 30 March 2020}}</ref> He became a [[Six Master]] and chairman of the governors of that school until the 1950s. His portrait by A. Hacker c. 1907 hangs in the hall.\n\nIn Oxford, he funded the building of the [[Dyson Perrins Laboratory]], which was the main centre for research into organic chemistry at [[Oxford University]] from its foundation in 1916 until its retirement as a laboratory in 2003. He received an honorary [[Doctor of Civil Law|DCL]] from Oxford University.\n\nDuring his life, he amassed one of the most important book collections in the world, particularly strong in medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]] and printed ballads. To help finance and re-establish the Royal Worcester factory after [[World War II]], he decided to sell his important collection of early printed books, and they were mostly dispersed in a series of sales at [[Sotheby's]] in London in 1946 and 1947. His illuminated manuscripts and other remaining printed books were sold after his death in three major auction sales in 1958 to 1960. A record total for a single collection of \u00a31,100,000 was raised by these sales. Items once owned by C. W. Dyson Perrins now form the basis of many other prominent collections, such as the [[Lessing J. Rosenwald]] Collection now in the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nMany other items from his collection were given or bequeathed by him to public institutions such as the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Winchester Cathedral]] library, and the [[British Museum]]. For example, his Mughal manuscript the [[Khamsa of Nizami (British Library, Or. 12208)|Emperor Akbar's ''Khamsa of Nizami'']] is now in the [[British Library]] and ''Palestrina'' by [[J. M. W. Turner]] is in the [[National Gallery]].\n\n==Family==\n\nPerrins married:\n# Catherine Christina Gregory at [[St Giles' Cathedral]] cathedral, Edinburgh on October 1889. They had five children.

He was born in Claines, near [[Worcester]], the son of James Dyson Perrins, the owner of the [[Lea & Perrins]] [[Worcestershire sauce]] factory and the grandson of [[William Henry Perrins|William Perrins]], co-originator of the Lea & Perrins secret recipe.\n\nHe was educated at [[Charterhouse School]] and [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], and then served in the [[Highland Light Infantry]]. After the death of his father, he took over management of Lea & Perrins. His father had also been a director of [[Royal Worcester|Royal Worcester Porcelain Factory]], and Charles followed him, becoming a director in 1891. He became chairman in 1901, and supported the factory financially. He bought the company outright in 1934 and ensured its continuity from his own fortune, until it could be taken public in 1954.\n\nIn 1927, he purchased the Royal Worcester Porcelain Factory's historic ceramics collection for a price above market value, to assist the firm's cashflow. In 1946, he established the Perrins Trust to unite the factory museum collection and his own private holdings of Royal Worcester and ensure their survival. After his death, his widow established the \"Dyson Perrins Museum\" at the factory site to house the collection. It is now called \"The [[Museum of Royal Worcester]]\" (previously \"Worcester Porcelain Museum\").\n\nPerrins lived in [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]] for most of his life and amongst his many charitable deeds in [[Worcestershire]] was the endowment of [[Dyson Perrins Church of England Academy]] in Malvern. He served as [[Mayor of Worcester]] for 1897\u201398 and as [[High Sheriff of Worcestershire]] for 1899\u20131900.\n\nHe was a major benefactor of the [[Royal Grammar School, Worcester]], and endowed new buildings including Perrins Hall (1914) named after his father, an [[Old Boys|old boy]]. The school organ is in this building and is played regularly at assemblies.<ref>{{Citation|title=School's Halls|newspaper= The RGS Times, Celebration Edition| date=October 2018|url=https://www.rgsw.org.uk/worcester/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/10/Newspaper.pdf|access-date = 30 March 2020}}</ref> He became a [[Six Master]] and chairman of the governors of that school until the 1950s. His portrait by A. Hacker c. 1907 hangs in the hall.\n\nIn Oxford, he funded the building of the [[Dyson Perrins Laboratory]], which was the main centre for research into organic chemistry at [[Oxford University]] from its foundation in 1916 until its retirement as a laboratory in 2003. He received an honorary [[Doctor of Civil Law|DCL]] from Oxford University.\n\nDuring his life, he amassed one of the most important book collections in the world, particularly strong in medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]] and printed ballads. To help finance and re-establish the Royal Worcester factory after [[World War II]], he decided to sell his important collection of early printed books, and they were mostly dispersed in a series of sales at [[Sotheby's]] in London in 1946 and 1947. His illuminated manuscripts and other remaining printed books were sold after his death in three major auction sales in 1958 to 1960. A record total for a single collection of \u00a31,100,000 was raised by these sales. Items once owned by C. W. Dyson Perrins now form the basis of many other prominent collections, such as the [[Lessing J. Rosenwald]] Collection now in the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nMany other items from his collection were given or bequeathed by him to public institutions such as the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Winchester Cathedral]] library, and the [[British Museum]]. For example, his Mughal manuscript the [[Khamsa of Nizami (British Library, Or. 12208)|Emperor Akbar's ''Khamsa of Nizami'']] is now in the [[British Library]] and ''Palestrina'' by [[J. M. W. Turner]] is in the [[National Gallery]].\n\n==Family==\n\nPerrins married:\n# Catherine Christina Gregory at [[St Giles' Cathedral]] cathedral, Edinburgh on October 1889. They had five children.

Most scholars generally identify him with [[Xerxes I]] of Persia, as did 19th-century Bible commentaries.<ref>\"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1454354 The Religious Policy of Xerxes and the 'Book of Esther']\", Littman, Robert J., ''The Jewish Quarterly Review'', 65.3, January 1975, p.145\u2013148.</ref> Three factors, among others, contribute to this identification:\n\n# It is agreed the Hebrew 'Ahasuerus' descended from the Persian names for Xerxes I. Additionally, the form of the king's name written in Esther 10:1, ''\u2019a\u1e25a\u0161\u0113r\u014d\u0161'' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|\u05d0\u05b2\u05d7\u05b7\u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05e8\u05b9\u05e9\u05c1}}) bears much more resemblance to the original old Persian ''X\u0161ay\u0101r\u0161a'' than the standard Hebrew form which does not omit the word\u2019s [[waw (letter)|vavim]].\n# Historian [[Herodotus]] records Xerxes I having penchants for women and wine, as well as mentioning the king ruled from India to Ethiopia in a magnificent palace in Shusan ([[Susa]]), all of which the Book of Esther corroborates. Herodotus also mentions that Xerxes I sought comfort in his [[harem]] following his [[Battle of Salamis|defeat at Salamis]] in the tenth month of his seventh year as king,{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} which is strikingly similar to the date of Ahasuerus choosing beautiful women from his harem in the tenth month of his seventh year as king (Esther 2:16).\n# Annals from the reign of Xerxes I mention an otherwise unattested official by the name of \"Marduka\", which some have proposed refers to Mordecai, as both are mentioned serving in the king's court.\n\nHowever, the Septuagint, the Vulgate, the [[Midrash]] of ''Esther Rabbah, I, 3'' and the [[Josippon]] identify the king as [[Artaxerxes I]], and the historian [[Josephus]] relates that this was the name by which he was known to the Greeks.<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=967&letter=A Ahasuerus] at the JewishEncyclopedia.com</ref> The [[Ethiopia|Ethiopic]] text calls him ''Ar\u0165eksis'', usually the Ethiopic equivalent of ''Artaxerxes''.\n\n{{Original research section|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[John of Ephesus]] and [[Bar-Hebraeus]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://syri.ac/bhchronicles|title=Chronicles of Bar Hebraeus {{!}} syri.ac|website=syri.ac|language=en|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref> identified him as [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]], a view strongly supported by the 20th century scholar [[Jacob Hoschander]].<ref name=\"Hosch\">Jacob Hoschander, ''The Book of Esther in the Light of History'', Oxford University Press, 1923</ref>{{page number|date=December 2019}}{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} [[Masudi]] recorded the Persian view of events which affirms the identification and [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]] similarly placed the events during the time of Artaxerxes II despite being confused by the Hebrew name for the king. ''Esther Rabba'' and the Vulgate present \"Ahasuerus\" as a different name for the king to \"Artaxerxes\" rather than an equivalent in different languages, and the Septuagint distinguished between the two names using a Greek transliteration of Ahasuerus for occurrences outside the Book of Esther. Indeed, an inscription from the time of Artaxerxes II records that he was also known as ''Arshu'' understood to be a shortening of the Babylonian form ''Achshiyarshu'' derived from the Persian ''Khshayarsha'' (Xerxes). The Greek historians [[Ctesias]] and [[Deinon]] noted that Artaxerxes II was also called ''Arsicas'' or ''Oarses'' respectively similarly understood to be derived from ''Khshayarsha'', the former as the shortened form together with the Persian suffix ''-ke'' applied to such shortened names;<ref name=\"Hosch\" />{{page number|date=December 2019}}{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} whereas in reality the Greek ''Artaxerxes'' is for the [[Old Persian]] ''Artax\u0161a\u00e7a'' (with /''\u00e7''/ for non-Persian /''\u03b8r''/, that is, ''Artax\u0161a\u03b8ra'', [[New Persian]] ''Ardashir'' \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631) < ''arta-'' 'justice' and ''x\u0161a\u00e7a-'' 'kingdom,' 'Having a kingdom of justice.' As is evident, the two names have different etymologies.\nIn his ''Historia Scholastica'' [[Petrus Comestor]] similarly identified Ahasuerus of Esther as the predecessor of a king called Artaxerxes (usually translated into English as Ahasuerus) who was also called Ochus i.e. [[Artaxerxes III]] thus also identifying the former Ahasuerus as Artaxerxes II. Comestor notes that Ochus had reconquered Egypt after the Ahasuerus of the book of Esther had lost it to pharaoh [[Amyrtaeus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Historia_Scholastica/Esther#De_Ocho_seu_Artaxerxe.|title=Historia Scholastica/Esther - Wikisource|author=|date=|website=la.wikisource.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Book of Ezra===\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn - Ahasuerus, Haman and Esther - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Ahasuerus and [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] at [[Ahasuerus and Haman at the Feast of Esther|Esther's Feast]]'', by [[Rembrandt]]]]\nAhasuerus is also given as the name of a [[King of Persia]] in the [[Book of Ezra]].<ref>{{bibleref|Ezra|4:5-7}}</ref> Modern commentators associate him with [[Xerxes I]] who reigned from 486 BC until 465 BC.

Titles of uncle and father-in-law to [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] are used by medieval Jewish commentators matches that of Cyaxares II, who is said to be the son of Astyages by [[Xenophon]]. Thus ''this'' Ahasuerus is commonly identified with [[Astyages]], king of the Medes. He is alternatively identified, together with the Ahasuerus of the Book of Tobit, as Cyaxares I, said to be the father of Astyages. Views differ on how to reconcile the sources in this case. One view is that the description of Ahasuerus as the \"father\" of Darius the Mede should be understood in the broader sense of \"forebear\" or \"ancestor.\" Another view notes that on the [[Behistun Inscription]], \"Cyaxares\" is a family name, and thus considers the description as literal, viewing Astyages as an intermediate ruler wrongly placed in the family line in the Greek sources.\n\n===Book of Tobit===\nIn some versions of the [[deuterocanon]]ical Book of Tobit, Ahasuerus is given as the name of an associate of [[Nebuchadrezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]], who together with him, destroyed [[Nineveh]] just before Tobit's death.<ref>Book of Tobit, 14:15.</ref>  A traditional [[Catholic]] view is that he is identical to the Ahasuerus of Daniel 9:1<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02005c.htm Maas, Anthony (1907).

This name (or title) is applied in the Hebrew Scriptures to three rulers. The same name is also applied uncertainly to a [[Babylon]]ian official (or Median king) noted in the [[Book of Tobit]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe original name was [[Old Persian]] ''[[Xerxes I|X\u0161aya.\u0101r\u0161an]]'' (< ''x\u0161aya'' 'king' + ''ar\u0161an'' 'male' > 'king of all male; Hero among Kings').

Most scholars generally identify him with [[Xerxes I]] of Persia, as did 19th-century Bible commentaries.<ref>\"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1454354 The Religious Policy of Xerxes and the 'Book of Esther']\", Littman, Robert J., ''The Jewish Quarterly Review'', 65.3, January 1975, p.145\u2013148.</ref> Three factors, among others, contribute to this identification:\n\n# It is agreed the Hebrew 'Ahasuerus' descended from the Persian names for Xerxes I. Additionally, the form of the king's name written in Esther 10:1, ''\u2019a\u1e25a\u0161\u0113r\u014d\u0161'' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|\u05d0\u05b2\u05d7\u05b7\u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05e8\u05b9\u05e9\u05c1}}) bears much more resemblance to the original old Persian ''X\u0161ay\u0101r\u0161a'' than the standard Hebrew form which does not omit the word\u2019s [[waw (letter)|vavim]].\n# Historian [[Herodotus]] records Xerxes I having penchants for women and wine, as well as mentioning the king ruled from India to Ethiopia in a magnificent palace in Shusan ([[Susa]]), all of which the Book of Esther corroborates. Herodotus also mentions that Xerxes I sought comfort in his [[harem]] following his [[Battle of Salamis|defeat at Salamis]] in the tenth month of his seventh year as king,{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} which is strikingly similar to the date of Ahasuerus choosing beautiful women from his harem in the tenth month of his seventh year as king (Esther 2:16).\n# Annals from the reign of Xerxes I mention an otherwise unattested official by the name of \"Marduka\", which some have proposed refers to Mordecai, as both are mentioned serving in the king's court.\n\nHowever, the Septuagint, the Vulgate, the [[Midrash]] of ''Esther Rabbah, I, 3'' and the [[Josippon]] identify the king as [[Artaxerxes I]], and the historian [[Josephus]] relates that this was the name by which he was known to the Greeks.<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=967&letter=A Ahasuerus] at the JewishEncyclopedia.com</ref> The [[Ethiopia|Ethiopic]] text calls him ''Ar\u0165eksis'', usually the Ethiopic equivalent of ''Artaxerxes''.\n\n{{Original research section|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[John of Ephesus]] and [[Bar-Hebraeus]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://syri.ac/bhchronicles|title=Chronicles of Bar Hebraeus {{!}} syri.ac|website=syri.ac|language=en|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref> identified him as [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]], a view strongly supported by the 20th century scholar [[Jacob Hoschander]].<ref name=\"Hosch\">Jacob Hoschander, ''The Book of Esther in the Light of History'', Oxford University Press, 1923</ref>{{page number|date=December 2019}}{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} [[Masudi]] recorded the Persian view of events which affirms the identification and [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]] similarly placed the events during the time of Artaxerxes II despite being confused by the Hebrew name for the king. ''Esther Rabba'' and the Vulgate present \"Ahasuerus\" as a different name for the king to \"Artaxerxes\" rather than an equivalent in different languages, and the Septuagint distinguished between the two names using a Greek transliteration of Ahasuerus for occurrences outside the Book of Esther. Indeed, an inscription from the time of Artaxerxes II records that he was also known as ''Arshu'' understood to be a shortening of the Babylonian form ''Achshiyarshu'' derived from the Persian ''Khshayarsha'' (Xerxes). The Greek historians [[Ctesias]] and [[Deinon]] noted that Artaxerxes II was also called ''Arsicas'' or ''Oarses'' respectively similarly understood to be derived from ''Khshayarsha'', the former as the shortened form together with the Persian suffix ''-ke'' applied to such shortened names;<ref name=\"Hosch\" />{{page number|date=December 2019}}{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} whereas in reality the Greek ''Artaxerxes'' is for the [[Old Persian]] ''Artax\u0161a\u00e7a'' (with /''\u00e7''/ for non-Persian /''\u03b8r''/, that is, ''Artax\u0161a\u03b8ra'', [[New Persian]] ''Ardashir'' \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631) < ''arta-'' 'justice' and ''x\u0161a\u00e7a-'' 'kingdom,' 'Having a kingdom of justice.' As is evident, the two names have different etymologies.\nIn his ''Historia Scholastica'' [[Petrus Comestor]] similarly identified Ahasuerus of Esther as the predecessor of a king called Artaxerxes (usually translated into English as Ahasuerus) who was also called Ochus i.e. [[Artaxerxes III]] thus also identifying the former Ahasuerus as Artaxerxes II. Comestor notes that Ochus had reconquered Egypt after the Ahasuerus of the book of Esther had lost it to pharaoh [[Amyrtaeus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Historia_Scholastica/Esther#De_Ocho_seu_Artaxerxe.|title=Historia Scholastica/Esther - Wikisource|author=|date=|website=la.wikisource.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Book of Ezra===\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn - Ahasuerus, Haman and Esther - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Ahasuerus and [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] at [[Ahasuerus and Haman at the Feast of Esther|Esther's Feast]]'', by [[Rembrandt]]]]\nAhasuerus is also given as the name of a [[King of Persia]] in the [[Book of Ezra]].<ref>{{bibleref|Ezra|4:5-7}}</ref> Modern commentators associate him with [[Xerxes I]] who reigned from 486 BC until 465 BC.

Thus this Ahasuerus is commonly identified with Astyages. He is alternatively identified, together with the Ahasuerus of the Book of Tobit, as Cyaxares I, said to be the father of Astyages. Views differ on how to reconcile the sources in this case. One view is that the description of Ahasuerus as the \"father\" of Darius the Mede should be understood in the broader sense of \"forebear\" or \"ancestor.\" Another view notes that on the [[Behistun Inscription]], \"Cyaxares\" is a family name, and thus considers the description as literal, viewing Astyages as an intermediate ruler wrongly placed in the family line in the Greek sources.\n\n===Book of Tobit===\nIn some versions of the [[deuterocanon]]ical Book of Tobit, Ahasuerus is given as the name of an associate of [[Nebuchadrezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]], who together with him, destroyed [[Nineveh]] just before Tobit's death.<ref>Book of Tobit, 14:15.</ref>  A traditional [[Catholic]] view is that he is identical to the Ahasuerus of Daniel 9:1<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02005c.htm Maas, Anthony (1907).

One Sports supplies and airs major sporting events in the [[Philippines]] and the world for free-to-air TV channels [[5 (TV channel)|5]], [[One Sports (TV channel)|One Sports channel]] and [[Cignal]]-exclusive channels [[One Sports (TV channel)|One Sports+]] and [[PBA Rush]].\n\nIts flagship program is [[Philippine Basketball Association]], the world's second oldest professional [[basketball]] league, since it acquired the television rights from 2004 to 2008 and again from 2011 until now.\n\n==History==\n\n===ABC Sports===\nThe network's sports division, then known as ABC Sports, was established in 2004 as a result of ABC-5's acquisition of broadcast rights to the [[Philippine Basketball Association]]. The telecasts were known as the ''PBA on ABC'', after the disbandment of the [[PBA on NBN/IBC|broadcasting consortium]] between [[People's Television Network|NBN-4]] and [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC-13]]. Aside from PBA, ABC Sports also broadcast volleyball games and local boxing bouts, as well as [[NBA]] basketball and [[WWE|WWE wrestling matches]] (in partnership with [[Solar Entertainment]]). But after ABC rebranded to TV5 in August 2008, the network still managed to cover the [[2008 PBA Fiesta Conference Finals]], though it is under the auspices of ABC's blocktimer [[Media Prima Berhad|MPB Primedia, Inc.]] After which, broadcast rights for PBA, NBA, and WWE were then moved to [[Solar Sports]] and [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN-9]] starting in the 2008\u201309 season.\n\n===TV5 Sports===\nIn 2009, ABC Sports, still under management of MPB Primedia, was renamed as TV5 Sports in the interim (does not identify as such), in which the network acquired broadcasting rights to the [[ASEAN Basketball League]] (the Philippine team in the league, [[AirAsia Philippine Patriots]], was by-then managed by ABC/TV5 owner Antonio \"Tonyboy\" Cojuangco, Jr.), U.S. boxing matches, and others.\nIn 2010, ABL's broadcasting contract with TV5 expired, after TV5 was acquired by [[MediaQuest Holdings]], and was moved to IBC-13 and later, [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action]].\n\n===Sports5===\nIn 2011, [[5 (TV channel)|TV5]] and [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC]], inked a blocktime deal which subsequently became [[AKTV]]. It was launched on May 5, 2011 through a marathon held at the Mall Of Asia Grounds in Pasay City.\n\nFrom then on, Sports5 obtained rights to air major sporting leagues and events like the [[Philippine Basketball Association]], [[United Football League (Philippines)|United Football League]] and the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines)|NCAA]] (returned to [[ABS-CBN Sports]] in 2015).\n\nUntil its flagship primetime sports block's closure in 2013 due to high blocktime costs and poor ratings, most of its programs are aired on IBC through its programming block AKTV. From June 2013 onwards, most of its sports coverages are shown on [[5 (TV channel)|TV5]], [[AksyonTV]] and [[Hyper (TV channel)|Hyper]]. It is headquartered at [[TV5 Media Center]], Reliance cor. Sheridan st., [[Mandaluyong City]].\n\nSports5 is the official TV partner of the Olympic Games in the Philippines from 2014 to 2016. In 2016, Sports5 acquired the Philippine broadcast rights (from [[ABS-CBN Sports]]) to air [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC) on free TV and satellite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.ph/combat-sports/news/ufc-on-sports5-cignal-abs-cbn-balls-skycable-destiny-cable|title=TV5 gets rights to air UFC fights as Balls Channel announces it is going off the air|publisher=Spin.ph|date=21 December 2015|accessdate=21 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===ESPN5===\nOn October 12, 2017, TV5 announced that it had reached a partnership with [[ESPN International]] to re-brand Sports 5 as '''ESPN5'''; the re-branding took effect the next day, coinciding with game 1 of the [[2017 PBA Governors' Cup|PBA Governors' Cup]] final. As part of the relationship, the channel acquired domestic rights to some of [[ESPN]]'s U.S. and international programming, including [[Boxing on ESPN|boxing]], [[IndyCar Series]], the [[NFL]], U.S. college sports, and the [[X Games]]. Although ESPN is a U.S. NBA broadcaster, the league has a separate rights deal with ABS-CBN. The operation includes a local version of ESPN's flagship studio program ''[[SportsCenter]]'', ''SportsCenter Philippines'' (which premiered on December 17, 2017), and collaboration between ESPN and TV5 on digital content\u2014having launched a localized version of [[ESPN.com]] and the streaming ESPN Player service on January 31, 2018.

One Sports supplies and airs major sporting events in the [[Philippines]] and the world for free-to-air TV channels [[5 (TV channel)|5]], [[One Sports (TV channel)|One Sports channel]] and [[Cignal]]-exclusive channels [[One Sports (TV channel)|One Sports+]] and [[PBA Rush]].\n\nIts flagship program is [[Philippine Basketball Association]], the world's second oldest professional [[basketball]] league, since it acquired the television rights from 2004 to 2008 and again from 2011 until now.\n\n==History==\n\n===ABC Sports===\nThe network's sports division, then known as ABC Sports, was established in 2004 as a result of ABC-5's acquisition of broadcast rights to the [[Philippine Basketball Association]]. The telecasts were known as the ''PBA on ABC'', after the disbandment of the [[PBA on NBN/IBC|broadcasting consortium]] between [[People's Television Network|NBN-4]] and [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC-13]]. Aside from PBA, ABC Sports also broadcast volleyball games and local boxing bouts, as well as [[NBA]] basketball and [[WWE|WWE wrestling matches]] (in partnership with [[Solar Entertainment]]). But after ABC rebranded to TV5 in August 2008, the network still managed to cover the [[2008 PBA Fiesta Conference Finals]], though it is under the auspices of ABC's blocktimer [[Media Prima Berhad|MPB Primedia, Inc.]] After which, broadcast rights for PBA, NBA, and WWE were then moved to [[Solar Sports]] and [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN-9]] starting in the 2008\u201309 season.\n\n===TV5 Sports===\nIn 2009, ABC Sports, still under management of MPB Primedia, was renamed as TV5 Sports in the interim (does not identify as such), in which the network acquired broadcasting rights to the [[ASEAN Basketball League]] (the Philippine team in the league, [[AirAsia Philippine Patriots]], was by-then managed by ABC/TV5 owner Antonio \"Tonyboy\" Cojuangco, Jr.), U.S. boxing matches, and others.\nIn 2010, ABL's broadcasting contract with TV5 expired, after TV5 was acquired by [[MediaQuest Holdings]], and was moved to IBC-13 and later, [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action]].\n\n===Sports5===\nIn 2011, [[5 (TV channel)|TV5]] and [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC]], inked a blocktime deal which subsequently became [[AKTV]]. It was launched on May 5, 2011 through a marathon held at the Mall Of Asia Grounds in Pasay City.\n\nFrom then on, Sports5 obtained rights to air major sporting leagues and events like the [[Philippine Basketball Association]], [[United Football League (Philippines)|United Football League]] and the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines)|NCAA]] (returned to [[ABS-CBN Sports]] in 2015).\n\nUntil its flagship primetime sports block's closure in 2013 due to high blocktime costs and poor ratings, most of its programs are aired on IBC through its programming block AKTV. From June 2013 onwards, most of its sports coverages are shown on [[5 (TV channel)|TV5]], [[AksyonTV]] and [[Hyper (TV channel)|Hyper]]. It is headquartered at [[TV5 Media Center]], Reliance cor. Sheridan st., [[Mandaluyong City]].\n\nSports5 is the official TV partner of the Olympic Games in the Philippines from 2014 to 2016. In 2016, Sports5 acquired the Philippine broadcast rights (from [[ABS-CBN Sports]]) to air [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC) on free TV and satellite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.ph/combat-sports/news/ufc-on-sports5-cignal-abs-cbn-balls-skycable-destiny-cable|title=TV5 gets rights to air UFC fights as Balls Channel announces it is going off the air|publisher=Spin.ph|date=21 December 2015|accessdate=21 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===ESPN5===\nOn October 12, 2017, TV5 announced that it had reached a partnership with [[ESPN International]] to re-brand Sports 5 as '''ESPN5'''; the re-branding took effect the next day, coinciding with game 1 of the [[2017 PBA Governors' Cup|PBA Governors' Cup]] final. As part of the relationship, the channel acquired domestic rights to some of [[ESPN]]'s U.S. and international programming, including [[Boxing on ESPN|boxing]], [[IndyCar Series]], the [[NFL]], U.S. college sports, and the [[X Games]]. Although ESPN is a U.S. NBA broadcaster, the league has a separate rights deal with ABS-CBN. The operation includes a local version of ESPN's flagship studio program ''[[SportsCenter]]'', ''SportsCenter Philippines'' (which premiered on December 17, 2017), and collaboration between ESPN and TV5 on digital content\u2014having launched a localized version of [[ESPN.com]] and the streaming ESPN Player service on January 31, 2018. The partnership marked the return of the ESPN brand to the country since the replacement of [[ESPN Philippines]] with [[Fox Sports Asia]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/espn-5-is-here-tv5-announces-partnership-with-worldwide-leader-in-sports/|title=ESPN-5 IS HERE - TV5 announces partnership with \u2018Worldwide Leader in Sports\u2019|publisher=Interaksyon|last=Bolante|first=Mikkel|date=October 12, 2017|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"ESPN 5\">{{cite press release|url=http://espnmediazone.com/us/press-releases/2017/10/tv-5-espn-collaborate-launch-espn-5-philippines/|title=TV 5 AND ESPN COLLABORATE TO LAUNCH ESPN 5 IN THE PHILIPPINES|publisher=ESPN|last=Melvin|first=Paul|date=October 11, 2017|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/other-sports/185056-espn-returns-philippine-tv|title=ESPN returns to Philippine TV with TV5 partnership|publisher=[[Rappler]]|last=Isaga|first=JP|date=October 12, 2017|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://technology.mb.com.ph/2018/01/31/370073/|title=ESPN launches New Digital Gateway with the Philippines Edition of ESPN.com and ESPN Player|publisher=[[Manila Bulletin]]|date=January 31, 2018|accessdate=January 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===One Sports===\nOn March 8, 2020, ESPN5 ceased to exist on television and was rebranded as One Sports (named after the then pay television channel of the same name), as both [[5 (TV channel)|5]] and the new One Sports channel decided to not carry any ESPN5-branded programming on its schedule.
