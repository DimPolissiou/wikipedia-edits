The Convention requires courts of contracting [[Sovereign state|states]] to give effect to private agreements to [[arbitration|arbitrate]] and to recognize and enforce [[arbitration award]]s made in other contracting states. Widely considered the foundational instrument for [[international arbitration]], it applies to arbitrations that are not considered as domestic awards in the state where recognition and enforcement is sought.\n\nThe New York Convention is very successful.  Nowadays many countries have adopted Arbitration laws based on the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law|UNCITRAL]] Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration. This works with the New York Convention so that the provisions on making an enforceable award, or asking a court to set it aside or not enforce it, are the same under the Model Law and the New York Convention.  The Model Law does not replace the NYC, it works with it. An award made in a country which is not a signatory to the NYC cannot take advantage of the Convention to enforce that award in the 163 Contracting States unless there is some bilateral recognition, whether or not the Arbitration was held under the provisions of the UNCITRAL Model Law.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1953, the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] (ICC) produced the first draft Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of International Arbitral Awards to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]].  With slight modifications, the Council submitted the convention to the International Conference in the Spring of 1958. The Conference was chaired by [[Willem Schurmann]], the Dutch Permanent Representative to the United Nations and [[Oscar Schachter]], a leading figure in international law who later taught at [[Columbia Law School]] and the Columbia School of International and Public Affairs, and served as the President of the American Society of International Law.\n\n[[International arbitration]] is an increasingly popular means of [[alternative dispute resolution]] for cross-border commercial transactions. The primary advantage of arbitration over court litigation is enforceability:  an arbitration award is enforceable in most countries in the world. Other advantages of arbitration include the ability to select a neutral forum to resolve disputes, that arbitration awards are final and not ordinarily subject to appeal, the ability to choose flexible procedures for the arbitration, and confidentiality.\n\nOnce a dispute between parties is settled, the winning party needs to collect the award or judgment. If the loser voluntarily pays, no court action is necessary.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Argen|first=Robert|date=2015-01-01|title=Ending Blind Spot Justice: Broadening the Transparency Trend in International Arbitration|ssrn=2393188|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network}}</ref> Otherwise, unless the assets of the losing party are located in the country where the court judgment was rendered, the winning party needs to obtain a court judgment in the jurisdiction where the other party resides or where its assets are located. Unless there is a treaty on recognition of court judgments between the country where the judgment is rendered and the country where the winning party seeks to collect, the winning party will be unable to use the court judgment to collect.\n\n=== Cases and statistics ===\nPublic information on overall and specific arbitration cases is quite limited as there is no need to involve the courts at all unless there is a dispute, and in most cases the loser pays voluntarily.<ref name=\":0\" /> In China, a review of disputed cases in China found that from 2000 to 2011, in 17 cases the Supreme People's Court upheld the refusal to enforce the arbitration agreement due to a provision in Article V; China has an automatic appeal system to the highest court, so this includes all such refusals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/ab/vol1/iss1/10/|title=\"Implementation of the New York Convention in China\" by Xiaohong Xia|website=digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref>\n\n==Summary of provisions==\nUnder the Convention, an [[arbitration award]] issued in any other state can generally be freely enforced in any other contracting state, only subject to certain, limited defenses. These defenses are:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/bjil/vol3/iss2/2/|title=\"Enforcement of Arbitral Awards under the New York Convention - Practic\" by Joseph T. McLaughlin and Laurie Genevro|website=scholarship.law.berkeley.edu|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref>\n\n#a party to the arbitration agreement was, under the law applicable to him, under some [[Capacity (law)|incapacity]], or the arbitration agreement was not valid under its [[Contract (conflict)#Proper law|governing law]];\n#a party was not given proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings, or was otherwise unable to present its case;\n#the award deals with an issue not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or contains matters beyond the scope of the arbitration (subject to the proviso that an award which contains decisions on such matters may be enforced to the extent that it contains decisions on matters submitted to arbitration which can be separated from those matters not so submitted);\n#the composition of the [[arbitral tribunal]] was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties or, failing such agreement, with the law of the place where the hearing took place (the \"[[lex loci arbitri]]\");\n#the award has not yet become binding upon the parties, or has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority, either in the country where the arbitration took place, or pursuant to the law of the arbitration agreement;\n#the subject matter of the award was not capable of resolution by arbitration; or\n#enforcement would be contrary to \"[[public policy]]\".\n{{wikisource|Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards}}\n\nAdditionally, there are three types of reservations that countries may apply:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://interarb.com/nyc/reservations |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620215224/http://interarb.com/nyc/reservations |archivedate=20 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }} New York Convention, 1958 - Reservations</ref>\n\n#Conventional Reservation - some countries only enforce arbitration awards issued in a Convention member state\n#Commercial Reservation \u2013 some countries only enforce arbitration awards that are related to commercial transactions\n#Reciprocity reservation \u2013 some countries may choose not to limit the Convention to only awards from other contracting states, but may however limit application to awards from non-contracting states such that they will only apply it to the extent to which such a non-contracting state grants reciprocal treatment.\n\nStates may make any or all of the above reservations. Because there are two similar issues conflated under the term \"reciprocity\", it is important to determine which such reservation (or both) an enforcing state has made.\n\n==Parties to the Convention==\nAs of September 2019, the Convention has 163 state parties, which includes 158 of the 193 United Nations member states plus the [[Cook Islands]], the [[Holy See]], and the [[State of Palestine]]. Thirty-four UN member states have not yet adopted the Convention. In addition, [[Taiwan]] has not been permitted to adopt the Convention (but generally enforces foreign arbitration judgments) and a number of [[British Overseas Territories]] have not had the Convention extended to them by Order in Council. British Overseas Territories to which the New York Convention has not yet been extended by Order in Council are: [[Anguilla]], [[Falkland Islands]], [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], [[Montserrat]], [[Saint Helena]] (including Ascension and Tristan da Cunha).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In ''[[Foster v. Neilson]]'', the Supreme Court held \"Our constitution declares a treaty to be the law of the land.  It is, consequently, to be regarded in courts of justice as equivalent to an act of the Legislature, whenever it operates of itself without the aid of any legislative provision.\"<ref>Foster v. Neilson, 27 U.S. 253, 314 (1829). See also Valentine v. U.S. ex rel. Neidecker, 57 S.Ct. 100, 103 (1936); Medellin v. Dretke, 125 S.Ct. 2088, 2103 (2005); Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 126 S.Ct. 2669, 2695 (2006).</ref> Thus, over a course of 181 years, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a self-executing treaty is an act of the Legislature (i.e., act of Congress).\n\nWith specific regard to the New York Convention, at least one court discussed, but ultimately avoided, the issue of whether the treaty is self-executing.  The court nonetheless held that the Convention was, at the least, an implemented non-self-executing treaty that still had legal force as a treaty (as distinguished from an Act of Congress).<ref>''Safety National Casualty Corp. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London'', 587 F.3d 714 (5th Cir. 2009) (en banc), ''cert. den'd'', 562 U.S. 827 (2010).</ref> Based on that determination, the court held that the Convention preempted state law that sought to void arbitration clauses in international reinsurance treaties.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Hague Choice of Court Convention]]\n*[[Hague Judgments Convention]]\n\n==External links==\n* [https://archive.is/20050720011050/http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration/NYConvention.html/ Uncitral]\n* [http://www.newyorkconvention1958.org/ 1958 New York Convention Guide] (This website was developed by Shearman & Sterling and Columbia Law School, in cooperation with UNCITRAL)\n* [http://www.newyorkconvention.org/ New York Convention], gives access to information regarding the New York Convention in general, its history, its interpretation and application by the courts\n* [http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration/NYConvention_status.html Status.

of Foreign Arbitral Awards''', commonly known as the '''New York Convention''', was adopted by a [[United Nations]] diplomatic conference on 10 June 1958 and entered into force on 7 June 1959. The Convention requires courts of contracting [[Sovereign state|states]] to give effect to private agreements to [[arbitration|arbitrate]] and to recognize and enforce [[arbitration award]]s made in other contracting states. Widely considered the foundational instrument for [[international arbitration]], it applies to arbitrations that are not considered as domestic awards in the state where recognition and enforcement is sought.\n\nThe New York Convention is very successful.  Nowadays many countries have adopted Arbitration laws based on the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law|UNCITRAL]] Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration. This works with the New York Convention so that the provisions on making an enforceable award, or asking a court to set it aside or not enforce it, are the same under the Model Law and the New York Convention.  The Model Law does not replace the NYC, it works with it. An award made in a country which is not a signatory to the NYC cannot take advantage of the Convention to enforce that award in the 163 Contracting States unless there is some bilateral recognition, whether or not the Arbitration was held under the provisions of the UNCITRAL Model Law.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1953, the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] (ICC) produced the first draft Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of International Arbitral Awards to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]].  With slight modifications, the Council submitted the convention to the International Conference in the Spring of 1958. The Conference was chaired by [[Willem Schurmann]], the Dutch Permanent Representative to the United Nations and [[Oscar Schachter]], a leading figure in international law who later taught at [[Columbia Law School]] and the Columbia School of International and Public Affairs, and served as the President of the American Society of International Law.\n\n[[International arbitration]] is an increasingly popular means of [[alternative dispute resolution]] for cross-border commercial transactions. The primary advantage of arbitration over court litigation is enforceability:  an arbitration award is enforceable in most countries in the world. Other advantages of arbitration include the ability to select a neutral forum to resolve disputes, that arbitration awards are final and not ordinarily subject to appeal, the ability to choose flexible procedures for the arbitration, and confidentiality.\n\nOnce a dispute between parties is settled, the winning party needs to collect the award or judgment. If the loser voluntarily pays, no court action is necessary.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Argen|first=Robert|date=2015-01-01|title=Ending Blind Spot Justice: Broadening the Transparency Trend in International Arbitration|ssrn=2393188|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network}}</ref> Otherwise, unless the assets of the losing party are located in the country where the court judgment was rendered, the winning party needs to obtain a court judgment in the jurisdiction where the other party resides or where its assets are located. Unless there is a treaty on recognition of court judgments between the country where the judgment is rendered and the country where the winning party seeks to collect, the winning party will be unable to use the court judgment to collect.\n\n=== Cases and statistics ===\nPublic information on overall and specific arbitration cases is quite limited as there is no need to involve the courts at all unless there is a dispute, and in most cases the loser pays voluntarily.<ref name=\":0\" /> In China, a review of disputed cases in China found that from 2000 to 2011, in 17 cases the Supreme People's Court upheld the refusal to enforce the arbitration agreement due to a provision in Article V; China has an automatic appeal system to the highest court, so this includes all such refusals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/ab/vol1/iss1/10/|title=\"Implementation of the New York Convention in China\" by Xiaohong Xia|website=digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref>\n\n==Summary of provisions==\nUnder the Convention, an [[arbitration award]] issued in any other state can generally be freely enforced in any other contracting state, only subject to certain, limited defenses. These defenses are:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/bjil/vol3/iss2/2/|title=\"Enforcement of Arbitral Awards under the New York Convention - Practic\" by Joseph T. McLaughlin and Laurie Genevro|website=scholarship.law.berkeley.edu|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref>\n\n#a party to the arbitration agreement was, under the law applicable to him, under some [[Capacity (law)|incapacity]], or the arbitration agreement was not valid under its [[Contract (conflict)#Proper law|governing law]];\n#a party was not given proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings, or was otherwise unable to present its case;\n#the award deals with an issue not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or contains matters beyond the scope of the arbitration (subject to the proviso that an award which contains decisions on such matters may be enforced to the extent that it contains decisions on matters submitted to arbitration which can be separated from those matters not so submitted);\n#the composition of the [[arbitral tribunal]] was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties or, failing such agreement, with the law of the place where the hearing took place (the \"[[lex loci arbitri]]\");\n#the award has not yet become binding upon the parties, or has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority, either in the country where the arbitration took place, or pursuant to the law of the arbitration agreement;\n#the subject matter of the award was not capable of resolution by arbitration; or\n#enforcement would be contrary to \"[[public policy]]\".\n{{wikisource|Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards}}\n\nAdditionally, there are three types of reservations that countries may apply:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://interarb.com/nyc/reservations |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620215224/http://interarb.com/nyc/reservations |archivedate=20 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }} New York Convention, 1958 - Reservations</ref>\n\n#Conventional Reservation - some countries only enforce arbitration awards issued in a Convention member state\n#Commercial Reservation \u2013 some countries only enforce arbitration awards that are related to commercial transactions\n#Reciprocity reservation \u2013 some countries may choose not to limit the Convention to only awards from other contracting states, but may however limit application to awards from non-contracting states such that they will only apply it to the extent to which such a non-contracting state grants reciprocal treatment.\n\nStates may make any or all of the above reservations. Because there are two similar issues conflated under the term \"reciprocity\", it is important to determine which such reservation (or both) an enforcing state has made.\n\n==Parties to the Convention==\nAs of September 2019, the Convention has 163 state parties, which includes 158 of the 193 United Nations member states plus the [[Cook Islands]], the [[Holy See]], and the [[State of Palestine]]. Thirty-threeUN member states have not adopted the Convention. In addition, [[Taiwan]] has not been permitted to adopt the Convention (but generally enforces foreign arbitration judgments) and a number of [[British Overseas Territories]] have not had the Convention extended to them by Order in Council. British Overseas Territories to which the New York Convention has not yet been extended by Order in Council are: [[Anguilla]], [[Falkland Islands]], [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], [[Montserrat]], [[Saint Helena]] (including Ascension and Tristan da Cunha).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In ''[[Foster v. Neilson]]'', the Supreme Court held \"Our constitution declares a treaty to be the law of the land.  It is, consequently, to be regarded in courts of justice as equivalent to an act of the Legislature, whenever it operates of itself without the aid of any legislative provision.\"<ref>Foster v. Neilson, 27 U.S. 253, 314 (1829). See also Valentine v. U.S. ex rel. Neidecker, 57 S.Ct. 100, 103 (1936); Medellin v. Dretke, 125 S.Ct. 2088, 2103 (2005); Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 126 S.Ct. 2669, 2695 (2006).</ref> Thus, over a course of 181 years, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a self-executing treaty is an act of the Legislature (i.e., act of Congress).\n\nWith specific regard to the New York Convention, at least one court discussed, but ultimately avoided, the issue of whether the treaty is self-executing.  The court nonetheless held that the Convention was, at the least, an implemented non-self-executing treaty that still had legal force as a treaty (as distinguished from an Act of Congress).<ref>''Safety National Casualty Corp. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London'', 587 F.3d 714 (5th Cir. 2009) (en banc), ''cert. den'd'', 562 U.S. 827 (2010).</ref> Based on that determination, the court held that the Convention preempted state law that sought to void arbitration clauses in international reinsurance treaties.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Hague Choice of Court Convention]]\n*[[Hague Judgments Convention]]\n\n==External links==\n* [https://archive.is/20050720011050/http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration/NYConvention.html/ Uncitral]\n* [http://www.newyorkconvention1958.org/ 1958 New York Convention Guide] (This website was developed by Shearman & Sterling and Columbia Law School, in cooperation with UNCITRAL)\n* [http://www.newyorkconvention.org/ New York Convention], gives access to information regarding the New York Convention in general, its history, its interpretation and application by the courts\n* [http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration/NYConvention_status.html Status.

The military and judiciary have regularly intervened in politics to block or ban popular parties representing conservative Muslim Turks who were attempting to relax the restrictions on traditional religious practices, such as women's wearing of [[Headscarf controversy in Turkey|headscarves]]. The military has toppled four elected governments: by coups in [[1960 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat|1960]] and [[1980 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat|1980]], and by military decisions in [[1971 Turkish military memorandum|1971]] and [[1997 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat|1997]]. In addition, the military has banned [[List of historical parties in Turkey|several major political parties]]. In 1998, Erdo\u011fan, who was the mayor of Istanbul at the time, was banned for life from politics, and jailed, because he had read a certain poem several years before, at a public meeting.

Successful coups require that the mass media be controlled by the rebels.<ref name=\"Beauchamp\" /> This allows even small rebel contingents to portray themselves as fully in control, and their victory as inevitable. Consequently, they convince the public, along with neutral and even loyalist soldiers, to defect to them, or at least not to resist. The rebels failed to properly broadcast their messages effectively across the media that they controlled.<ref name=\"Beauchamp\"/> They failed to capture [[Turksat (Company)|Turksat]], Turkey's main cable and satellite communications company, and failed to gain control of the country's television and mobile phone networks. This allowed Erdo\u011fan to make his Facetime call, and to speak on television.<ref name=\"Al-Monitor Anonymous\" />\n\nOther scholars of civil-military relations, like Drew H. Kinney, have said reports like Luttwak and Singh's miss the point of their own analysis: civil resistance thwarted the coup.<ref name=\"auto8\" /> Luttwak's argument is that wayward elements of the Turkish armed forces were not able to silence Erdo\u011fan. Singh says that the rebels could not project success because they couldn't control the message. Kinney states that neither of these reasons on their own matter, but rather it's their effect\u2014civil disobedience\u2014that is important. We might find that \"[G\u00fclen's movement] ... [might] have had nothing to do with the attempted takeover in July, but civilians [nevertheless] definitely played a role in thwarting the coup,\" writes Kinney. \"...[A]n unhappy civilian populace mobilized to face down the military.\"<ref name=\"auto8\" />\n\nErdo\u011fan wasn't censored (Luttwak's point) and was therefore able to use FaceTime to mobilize resistance, which in turn hindered the conspirators' ability to project success (Singh's point). The end result is civilian resistance to soldiers, i.e., people power. The reason Singh, Luttwak, and other scholars of civil-military relations miss this is, according to Kinney, because they \"usually do not study extra-military reasons for coup failures/successes,\" but rather put a premium on \"the inner-workings of the [military] operation.\" In short, they blame the military for its failure rather than acknowledge the power of the masses and their successes.<ref name=\"auto8\">{{Cite journal|last=Kinney|first=Drew Holland|year=2016|title=Civilian Actors in the Turkish Military Drama of July 2016|url=http://www.emgr.unic.ac.cy/wp-content/uploads/EMPN_10.pdf|journal=Eastern Mediterranean Policy Note|volume=10|page=4|via=}}</ref>\n\nPro-government forces sent text messages to every Turkish citizen calling for them to protest against the coup attempt.<ref name=\"Nissenbaum\" /> Throughout the night [[salawat|''sela'']] prayers were repeatedly called from mosque [[minaret]]s across the country to encourage people to resist the coup plotters.<ref name=\"auto7\"/><ref name=\"Nissenbaum\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news1130.com/2016/07/17/turkey-pray-for-dead-coup/|title=Turkey's 85,000 mosques pray for dead in coup|date=17 July 2016|accessdate=25 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/latest-turkey-cracks-alleged-coup-plotters-40644190 |title=The Latest: More Police Arrive in Istanbul After Coup Bid |first=ABC |last=News}}</ref> While the ''sela'' is usually called from minarets to inform the public of a funeral, they are also traditionally performed to notify of a significant event, in this case \"to rally people\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haberturk.com/yazarlar/murat-bardakci/1269057-sela|title=Sel\u00e2|accessdate=25 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe coup plotters initiated their operation hours ahead of the planned time when they understood that their plans had been compromised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Turkish-Army-Knew-About-Coup-5-Hours-Earlier-from-Intel-Agency-20160719-0035.html|title=Turkish Army Knew About Coup 5 Hours Earlier from Intel Agency|first=teleSUR /|last=mh-DB-egb|accessdate=25 August 2016}}</ref>{{deprecated inline|certain=y|November 2019}} Had the coup been launched at its original time in the middle of the night, much of the population would have been asleep and the streets would have been mostly empty.<ref name=\"Al-Monitor-Metin\">{{cite web |last1=Metin |first1=Gurcan |title=What went wrong with Turkey's WhatsApp Coup |url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/07/turkey-coup-attempt-basic-cause-was-premature-birth.html |website=Al-Monitor |accessdate=25 July 2016 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160724192352/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/07/turkey-coup-attempt-basic-cause-was-premature-birth.html |archivedate=24 July 2016 |df=dmy-all |date=2016-07-19 }}</ref>\n\nReports have emerged, neither confirmed or denied by Russia or Turkey, that the Russian [[Main Intelligence Directorate]] intercepted signals on an imminent coup which were passed on to loyal Turkish operatives.

The military and judiciary have regularly intervened in politics to block or ban popular parties representing conservative Muslim Turks who were attempting to relax the restrictions on traditional religious practices, such as women's wearing of [[Headscarf controversy in Turkey|headscarves]]. The military has toppled four elected governments: by coups in [[1960 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat|1960]] and [[1980 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat|1980]], and by military decisions in [[1971 Turkish military memorandum|1971]] and [[1997 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat|1997]]. In addition, the military has banned [[List of historical parties in Turkey|several major political parties]]. In 1998, Erdo\u011fan, who was the mayor of Istanbul at the time, was banned for life from politics, and jailed, because he had read a certain poem several years before, at a public meeting.

Successful coups require that the mass media be controlled by the rebels.<ref name=\"Beauchamp\" /> This allows even small rebel contingents to portray themselves as fully in control, and their victory as inevitable. Consequently, they convince the public, along with neutral and even loyalist soldiers, to defect to them, or at least not to resist. The rebels failed to properly broadcast their messages effectively across the media that they controlled.<ref name=\"Beauchamp\"/> They failed to capture [[Turksat (Company)|Turksat]], Turkey's main cable and satellite communications company, and failed to gain control of the country's television and mobile phone networks. This allowed Erdo\u011fan to make his Facetime call, and to speak on television.<ref name=\"Al-Monitor Anonymous\" />\n\nOther scholars of civil-military relations, like Drew H. Kinney, have said reports like Luttwak and Singh's miss the point of their own analysis: civil resistance thwarted the coup.<ref name=\"auto8\" /> Luttwak's argument is that wayward elements of the Turkish armed forces were not able to silence Erdo\u011fan. Singh says that the rebels could not project success because they couldn't control the message. Kinney states that neither of these reasons on their own matter, but rather it's their effect\u2014civil disobedience\u2014that is important. We might find that \"[G\u00fclen's movement] ... [might] have had nothing to do with the attempted takeover in July, but civilians [nevertheless] definitely played a role in thwarting the coup,\" writes Kinney. \"...[A]n unhappy civilian populace mobilized to face down the military.\"<ref name=\"auto8\" />\n\nErdo\u011fan wasn't censored (Luttwak's point) and was therefore able to use FaceTime to mobilize resistance, which in turn hindered the conspirators' ability to project success (Singh's point). The end result is civilian resistance to soldiers, i.e., people power. The reason Singh, Luttwak, and other scholars of civil-military relations miss this is, according to Kinney, because they \"usually do not study extra-military reasons for coup failures/successes,\" but rather put a premium on \"the inner-workings of the [military] operation.\" In short, they blame the military for its failure rather than acknowledge the power of the masses and their successes.<ref name=\"auto8\">{{Cite journal|last=Kinney|first=Drew Holland|year=2016|title=Civilian Actors in the Turkish Military Drama of July 2016|url=http://www.emgr.unic.ac.cy/wp-content/uploads/EMPN_10.pdf|journal=Eastern Mediterranean Policy Note|volume=10|page=4|via=}}</ref>\n\nPro-government forces sent text messages to every Turkish citizen calling for them to protest against the coup attempt.<ref name=\"Nissenbaum\" /> Throughout the night [[salawat|''sela'']] prayers were repeatedly called from mosque [[minaret]]s across the country to encourage people to resist the coup plotters.<ref name=\"auto7\"/><ref name=\"Nissenbaum\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news1130.com/2016/07/17/turkey-pray-for-dead-coup/|title=Turkey's 85,000 mosques pray for dead in coup|date=17 July 2016|accessdate=25 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/latest-turkey-cracks-alleged-coup-plotters-40644190 |title=The Latest: More Police Arrive in Istanbul After Coup Bid |first=ABC |last=News}}</ref> While the ''sela'' is usually called from minarets to inform the public of a funeral, they are also traditionally performed to notify of a significant event, in this case \"to rally people\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haberturk.com/yazarlar/murat-bardakci/1269057-sela|title=Sel\u00e2|accessdate=25 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe coup plotters initiated their operation hours ahead of the planned time when they understood that their plans had been compromised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Turkish-Army-Knew-About-Coup-5-Hours-Earlier-from-Intel-Agency-20160719-0035.html|title=Turkish Army Knew About Coup 5 Hours Earlier from Intel Agency|first=teleSUR /|last=mh-DB-egb|accessdate=25 August 2016}}</ref>{{deprecated inline|certain=y|November 2019}} Had the coup been launched at its original time in the middle of the night, much of the population would have been asleep and the streets would have been mostly empty.<ref name=\"Al-Monitor-Metin\">{{cite web |last1=Metin |first1=Gurcan |title=What went wrong with Turkey's WhatsApp Coup |url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/07/turkey-coup-attempt-basic-cause-was-premature-birth.html |website=Al-Monitor |accessdate=25 July 2016 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160724192352/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/07/turkey-coup-attempt-basic-cause-was-premature-birth.html |archivedate=24 July 2016 |df=dmy-all |date=2016-07-19 }}</ref>\n\nReports have emerged, neither confirmed or denied by Russia or Turkey, that the Russian [[Main Intelligence Directorate]] intercepted signals on an imminent coup which were passed on to loyal Turkish operatives.
