The initial manuscript was sent to Lyle Stuart in 1970.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nPowell stated ''The Anarchist Cookbook'' was initially designed as a book meant to provide education towards \"the silent majority\" of the American population. He described that the book was not intended for extant political fringe organizations, rather it was designed to galvanize a great societal change by inciting the general population. The ultimate goal of the text was to provide the general population with the skills and capabilities to organize against fascist, capitalist, and communist threats that he perceived.

Powell envisioned the United State people rebelling against what he deemed to be oppressive capitalistic ideals, and to a lesser extent, against fascist and communist movements.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Content ===\nPowell begins the content of his book discussing anarchy and anarchist theory. Anarchy, by his definition, is a wide scale mass uprising by the people, similar to that of civil disobedience through violence.<ref name=\":3\" /> He believed that anarchy was the innate state of all individuals, and therefore human nature would drive people to participate in such practices. Powell believed that current expressions of politics, arts, music, and education all contained innate principles of anarchist ideals, thereby equating anarchism to individualism. This principle drives Powell's argumentation as he believed that the current political climate and Vietnam war had undermined human values, therefore revolution based upon his perception of human dignity and freedom was what drove him to write the piece. He ends his introduction by warning of the seriousness that these recipes may have deadly consequences if used improperly.<ref name=\":3\" /> The chapters of ''The Anarchist Cookbook'' include descriptions and detailed instructions in hand-to-hand combat, explosives, booby traps, drugs, tear gas, sabotage and demolition, surveillance, improvised weapons and other topics related to anarchism.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Legal reviews ===\nAt the time of its publication, one [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] memo described ''The Anarchist Cookbook'' as \"one of the crudest, low-brow, paranoiac writing efforts ever attempted\".<ref>[[Jesse Walker|Walker, Jesse]] (2011-02-16) [http://reason.com/blog/2011/02/16/the-fbi-on-the-anarchist-cookb The FBI on ''The Anarchist Cookbook''], ''[[Reason magazine|Reason]]''</ref> The book was reviewed by the Department of Justice, the White House, the FBI, and by both [[John Dean]] and [[Mark Felt]], [[Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon's]] lawyer and [[J.

The initial manuscript was sent to Lyle Stuart in 1970.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nPowell stated ''The Anarchist Cookbook'' was initially designed as a book meant to provide education towards \"the silent majority\" of the American population. He described that the book was not intended for extant political fringe organizations, rather it was designed to galvanize a great societal change by inciting the general population. The ultimate goal of the text was to provide the general population with the skills and capabilities to organize against fascist, capitalist, and communist threats that he perceived.

Powell states that fringe political organizations, such [[Minutemen (anti-Communist organization)|The Minutemen]] and [[Weather Underground|The Weathermen]], are not the intended audience, rather it is written for \"the silent majority\". Powell envisioned the United State people rebelling against what he deemed to be oppressive capitalistic ideals, and to a lesser extent, against fascist and communist movements.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Content ===\nPowell begins the content of his book discussing anarchy and anarchist theory. Anarchy, by his definition, is a wide scale mass uprising by the people, similar to that of civil disobedience through violence.<ref name=\":3\" /> He believed that anarchy was the innate state of all individuals, and therefore human nature would drive people to participate in such practices. Powell believed that current expressions of politics, arts, music, and education all contained innate principles of anarchist ideals, thereby equating anarchism to individualism. This principle drives Powell's argumentation as he believed that the current political climate and Vietnam war had undermined human values, therefore revolution based upon his perception of human dignity and freedom was what drove him to write the piece. He ends his introduction by warning of the seriousness that these recipes may have deadly consequences if used improperly.<ref name=\":3\" /> The chapters of ''The Anarchist Cookbook'' include descriptions and detailed instructions in hand-to-hand combat, explosives, booby traps, drugs, tear gas, sabotage and demolition, surveillance, improvised weapons and other topics related to anarchism.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Legal reviews ===\nAt the time of its publication, one [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] memo described ''The Anarchist Cookbook'' as \"one of the crudest, low-brow, paranoiac writing efforts ever attempted\".<ref>[[Jesse Walker|Walker, Jesse]] (2011-02-16) [http://reason.com/blog/2011/02/16/the-fbi-on-the-anarchist-cookb The FBI on ''The Anarchist Cookbook''], ''[[Reason magazine|Reason]]''</ref> The book was reviewed by the Department of Justice, the White House, the FBI, and by both [[John Dean]] and [[Mark Felt]], [[Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon's]] lawyer and [[J.

A [[Planned community|new town]], situated on the border with [[Hertfordshire]] and London, Harlow occupies a large area of land on the south bank of the upper [[River Stort|Stort Valley]], which has been made navigable through other towns and features a canal section near its [[watermill]]. [[Old Harlow]] is a village-size suburb founded by the early medieval age and most of its [[high street]] buildings are early Victorian and residential, mostly protected by one of the Conservation Areas in the district. In Old Harlow is a field named '''Harlowbury''', a de-settled monastic area which has the remains of a chapel, a [[scheduled ancient monument]].\n\nThe [[M11 motorway]] passes through the east of the district, entirely to the east of the town. Harlow has its own commercial and leisure economy. It is also an outer part of the [[London commuter belt]] and employment centre of the M11 corridor which includes [[Cambridge]] and [[London Stansted Airport]] to the north. At the time of the 2011 Census, Harlow's population was recorded at 81,944 and its district had the third-highest proportion of [[social housing]] in England, 26.9%,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} a legacy of the 1947 commitment to re-house [[The Blitz|blitzed]] London families after World War II and provide a percentage of homes for other needy families who cannot afford [[renting|market rent]]s.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThere is some dispute as to where the [[placename]] Harlow derives from. One theory is that it derives from the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] words 'here' and 'hlaw', meaning \"army hill\", probably to be identified with Mulberry Hill, which was used as the [[wikt:moot|moot]] or meeting place for the district.\n\nThe other theory is that it derives from the words 'here' and 'hearg', meaning \"temple hill/mound\", probably to be identified with an [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] burial mound, later a [[Roman Britain|Roman temple]] site on River Way.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n\nThe earliest deposits are of a Mesolithic (circa 10,000 BC) hunting camp excavated by Davey in Northbrooks in the 1970s (Unpublished) closely followed by the large and unexcavated deposits of Neolithic flint beside Gilden Way. These deposits are mostly known because of the large numbers of surface-bound, worked flint. Substantial amounts of worked flint suggest an organised working of flint in the area. Large amounts of debitage litter the area and tools found include axeheads, hammers, blades, dowels and other boring tools and multipurpose flints such as scrapers. An organised field walk in the late 1990s by Bartlett (Unpublished) indicates that most of the area, some 80 hectares, produced worked flint from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age with a smattering of Mesolithic. This indicates organised industry existed from 5000 BC to 2000 BC. The deposits are so large and dispersed that any major archaeological work in the area will have to take this into consideration before any ground work is started. Harlow was in Roman times the site of a small town (around [[Harlow Mill railway station]]) with a substantial stone built temple.<ref>Barry C. Burnham, J. S. Wacher: ''The Small Towns of Roman Britain'', Berkeley, Los Angeles 1990, pp. 186-187</ref>\n\n===Later history===\n[[File:St Mary's Church, Churchgate Street - geograph.org.uk - 1576708.jpg|thumb|[[St Mary & St Hugh, Old Harlow|St Mary's Church]], Churchgate Street]]\n\nThe entry in the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Domesday Book]] reads: ''Herlaua: St Edmunds Abbey before and after 1066; Geoffrey from Count Eustace; Thorgils from Eudo the Steward; Richard from Ranulf, brother of Ilger. Mill, 7 beehives, 8 cobs, 43 cattle, 3 foals.''

This includes for instance the Grade II listed [[St Mary & St Hugh, Old Harlow|St Mary's Church]] in Churchgate Street.  Its former Chapel is in a ruinous state in a field which was once the '''Harlowbury Abbey''' part of Old Harlow, is Grade I listed and is a [[scheduled ancient monument]].<ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1111694|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nKingsmoor House on Paringdon Road is a Grade II* listed building and dates from the 18th century. It was built as a gentleman's residence and owned by local families including the [[Harlow Woods|Risden]], [[John Archer-Houblon|Houblon]] and [[Edward Joseph Todhunter|Todhunter]] families. It was later used as a private school and council offices before falling derelict.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kingsmoor House - Harlow - May 2011 |url=https://www.derelictplaces.co.uk/main/residential-sites/18970-kingsmoor-house-harlow-2011-a.html |website=Derelict Places}}</ref> It has since been restored and converted into residential apartments.\n\n===The New Town===\n\nThe original Harlow [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] was built after [[World War II]] to ease overcrowding in London and the surrounding areas due to the devastation caused by the bombing during the Blitz. Harlow was, along with places such as [[Basildon]], [[Stevenage]] and [[Hemel Hempstead]] a result of the New Towns Act of 1946, with the master plan for Harlow drawn up in 1947 by Sir [[Frederick Gibberd]].<ref>[http://www.gardenvisit.com/b/gibberd.htm Gardens Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041020033303/http://www.gardenvisit.com/b/gibberd.htm |date=20 October 2004 }} \u2013 Frederick Gibberd</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8603701.stm New town, a name change and all the jazz] BBC News web site</ref> The town was planned from the outset and was designed to respect the existing landscape. A number of landscape wedges - which later became known as Green Wedges - were designed to cut through the town and separate the neighbourhoods of the town. The development incorporated the [[market town]] of Harlow, now a neighbourhood known as [[Old Harlow]], and the villages of Great Parndon, Latton, Tye Green, Potter Street, Churchgate Street, Little Parndon, and Netteswell. Each of the town's neighbourhoods is self-supporting with its own shopping precincts, community facilities and [[public house|pubs]]. Gibberd invited many of the country's leading post-war architects to design buildings in the town, including [[Philip Powell (architect)|Philip Powell]] and [[Hidalgo Moya]], [[Leonard Manasseh]], Michael Neylan, E C P Monson, Gerard Goalen, [[Maxwell Fry]], [[Jane Drew]], Graham Dawbarn, [[H. T. Cadbury-Brown]] and [[William Crabtree]].  Harlow has one of the most extensive cycle track networks in the country, connecting all areas of the town to the town centre and industrial areas.

Subsequently, many of the original town buildings, including most of its health centres, the Staple Tye shopping centre and many industrial units have been rebuilt. Gibberd's original town hall, a landmark in the town, has been demolished and replaced by a new civic centre and The Water Gardens shopping area.\n\n===Redevelopment===\n[[File:The Chase - geograph.org.uk - 400869.jpg|thumb|The Newhall housing development built circa 2007 between Old Harlow and Church Langley]]\n\nSince becoming a new town, Harlow has undergone several stages of expansion, the first of which was the \"mini expansion\" that was created by the building of the Sumners and Katherines estates in the mid-to-late seventies to the west of the existing town. Since then Harlow has further expanded with the Church Langley estate completed in 2005, and its newest neighbourhood [[Newhall, Essex|Newhall]] has completed the first stage of its development, with the second stage underway in 2013. The [[Harlow Gateway Scheme]] is currently underway, with the relocation of the Harlow Football Stadium to Barrow's Farm in early 2006, and the building of a new hotel, apartments, and a restaurant adjacent to the railway station being complete. The next stage of this scheme involves the completion of the 530 eco-homes being built on the former sports centre site, and the centre's relocation to the nearby former college playing field site.\n\nOther major developments under consideration include both a northern and southern bypass of the town, and significant expansion to the north, following the completed expansion to the east. The Harlow North<ref>[http://www.harlownorth.com Ropemaker Properties Limited] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305002149/http://www.harlownorth.com/ |date=5 March 2007 }} \u2013 Harlow North</ref> plans, currently awaiting permission, involve an extension of the town across the floodplains on the town's northern border, into neighbouring [[Hertfordshire]]. The plan was supported by former MP [[Bill Rammell]], all three political groups on Harlow Council, and the [[East of England Regional Assembly]]. It is opposed by Hertfordshire County Council, East Herts Council, [[Mark Prisk]], MP for Hertford and Stortford in whose constituency the development would be, and all the parishes concerned. The opposition is coordinated by a local group based in neighbouring East Hertfordshire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stopharlownorth.com|title=Page Redirection|website=www.stopharlownorth.com|accessdate=29 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105135104/http://www.stopharlownorth.com/|archivedate=5 January 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> An attempt to have Harlow North designated an \"Eco Town\" was rejected by the Minister for Housing, [[Caroline Flint]] MP, in April 2008.\n\nThe south of the town centre also underwent major regeneration, with the new Civic Centre being built and the town's famous Water Gardens being redeveloped, a landscape listed by [[English Heritage]].\n\nIn 2004 Harlow businessman [[Mohammad Ghadami|Mo Ghadami]] won his High Court case to block a multimillion-pound extension of the town's Harvey Centre. The Iranian-born entrepreneur, who presented his case in person, persuaded Mr Justice Richards to quash Harlow DC's grant of planning permission for the development. In his judgment he backed Mr Ghadami's claim of 'apparent bias or predetermination' in the decision, as a result of the continued participation of Michael Garnett, the chairman of the planning committee, in the planning process after he had attempted in telephone calls to persuade Mr Ghadami to consent to the scheme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lgcplus.com/harlow-planning-committee-chairmans-calls-to-objector-under-scrutiny/1231710.article|title=HARLOW PLANNING COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN'S CALLS TO OBJECTOR UNDER SCRUTINY|website=lgcplus.com|accessdate=29 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327014905/http://www.lgcplus.com/harlow-planning-committee-chairmans-calls-to-objector-under-scrutiny/1231710.article|archivedate=27 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011 the government announced the creation of an [[enterprise zone]] in the town.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-14552193 |title=New 'enterprise zones' announced around England |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |date=17 August 2011 |accessdate=10 March 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922152626/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-14552193 |archivedate=22 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Harlow Enterprise Zone consists of two separate sites under development, at Templefields and London Road, with the London Road site divided into north and south business parks.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.harlowstar.co.uk/Essex-County-Council-hand-experience-Harlow/story-25881332-detail/story.html |title=Essex County Council get first hand experience of Harlow Enterprise Zone |publisher=Harlow Star |date=17 January 2015 |accessdate=10 March 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402091437/http://www.harlowstar.co.uk/Essex-County-Council-hand-experience-Harlow/story-25881332-detail/story.html |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Permitted development (office to residential) flats===\nA flagship government policy to allow developers to convert office space to residential has led to a proliferation of new 'rabbit hutch' sized flats,<ref name=\"Jones2017\">{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Rupert |title=Welcome to rabbit-hutch Britain, land of the ever-shrinking home |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/feb/11/welcome-rabbit-hutch-britain-land-ever-shrinking-home |access-date=16 March 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=11 February 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Jones08\">{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Rupert |title=As small as 13 sq metres: are these the worst new flats in Britain? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/aug/25/flats-block-converting-offices-living-space |access-date=16 March 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=25 August 2018}}</ref> which are then let to London borough waiting list families.

Owned and run as a co-op, it provided employment to the town for over 50 years, before closing in 2002. It has since been demolished and the site now has small industrial units. At its peak, the factory employed over 500 people. At the time of its closure, the owner was Burton's Foods Ltd.

Having planned for one of the two big industrial estates to be built to the west of the town for easy motorway access, Sir Fredrick Gibberd was appalled when the motorway was eventually built to the east of the town instead, describing it as \"just about the most monstrous thing to ever happen to me as a planner\" during a 1982 interview.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gibberd|first1=Fredrick|title=Sir Fredrick Gibberd's - Harlow New Town 1982|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB3T5Gnfcu0&t=140s|website=Youtube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429145044/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB3T5Gnfcu0&t=140s|archivedate=29 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Running through the town is the [[A414 road|A414]], a major road from [[Hertford]] to [[Chelmsford]] and linking the town with the [[A10 road (England)|A10]] to the west. Another major road running from Harlow is the A1184, which also leads to the nearby town of [[Bishop's Stortford]].\n\n===Air===\n[[Bishop's Stortford]] is the closest large town to [[London Stansted Airport]], though Harlow is only 10 miles from this major transport hub, and therefore provides several hundred airport employees. The airport operator withdrew a planning application for a second runway after the General Election of 2010, when all major political parties opposed it.\n\n===Bus===\n[[File:Harlow bus station (geograph 3445799).jpg|thumb|right|Harlow Bus Station]]\nHarlow has an extensive bus network and serves as a regional hub for the local area, with operators such as Arriva (Herts and Essex) and Trustybus. There are links to many other local towns and villages such as Chelmsford City, Epping and Bishops Stortford.\n\n====Harlow First Avenue Multi-Modal Corridor====\n{{Infobox Future Infrastructure Project\n|property_name = Harlow First Avenue Multi-Modal Corridor\n|image_name = Harlow_developments.png\n|image_size = 200px\n|caption = Developments in and around Harlow.\n|location = Essex\n|proposer = Essex County Council\n|estimated cost = \u00a34.4&nbsp;million (2008)\n|planned start = \n|planned finish = February 2010\n|stakeholders = \n|geometry = [http://umapper.s3.amazonaws.com/maps/kml/45876.kml KML]\n}}\nEssex County Council was involved in development to Harlow's First Avenue, which was intended to reduce congestion and create better transport connections between the Newhall housing developments.

Consequently, almost all of Harlow's sculpture collection is in the open air, in shopping centres, housing estates and parks around the town.<ref>Whiteley, Gillian: ''Sculpture in Harlow'', Harlow Art Trust, 2005</ref>\n\nIn 2009 Harlow Council voted to celebrate Harlow's collection of sculpture by branding Harlow as 'Harlow Sculpture Town \u2013 The World's First Sculpture Town'.

A [[Planned community|new town]], situated on the border with [[Hertfordshire]] and London, Harlow occupies a large area of land on the south bank of the upper [[River Stort|Stort Valley]], which has been made navigable through other towns and features a canal section near its [[watermill]]. [[Old Harlow]] is a village-size suburb founded by the early medieval age and most of its [[high street]] buildings are early Victorian and residential, mostly protected by one of the Conservation Areas in the district. In Old Harlow is a field named '''Harlowbury''', a de-settled monastic area which has the remains of a chapel, a [[scheduled ancient monument]].\n\nThe [[M11 motorway]] passes through the east of the district, entirely to the east of the town. Harlow has its own commercial and leisure economy. It is also an outer part of the [[London commuter belt]] and employment centre of the M11 corridor which includes [[Cambridge]] and [[London Stansted Airport]] to the north. At the time of the 2011 Census, Harlow's population was recorded at 81,944 and its district had the third-highest proportion of [[social housing]] in England, 26.9%,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} a legacy of the 1947 commitment to re-house [[The Blitz|blitzed]] London families after World War II and provide a percentage of homes for other needy families who cannot afford [[renting|market rent]]s.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThere is some dispute as to where the [[placename]] Harlow derives from. One theory is that it derives from the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] words 'here' and 'hlaw', meaning \"army hill\", probably to be identified with Mulberry Hill, which was used as the [[wikt:moot|moot]] or meeting place for the district.\n\nThe other theory is that it derives from the words 'here' and 'hearg', meaning \"temple hill/mound\", probably to be identified with an [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] burial mound, later a [[Roman Britain|Roman temple]] site on River Way.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n\nThe earliest deposits are of a Mesolithic (circa 10,000 BC) hunting camp excavated by Davey in Northbrooks in the 1970s (Unpublished) closely followed by the large and unexcavated deposits of Neolithic flint beside Gilden Way. These deposits are mostly known because of the large numbers of surface-bound, worked flint. Substantial amounts of worked flint suggest an organised working of flint in the area. Large amounts of debitage litter the area and tools found include axeheads, hammers, blades, dowels and other boring tools and multipurpose flints such as scrapers. An organised field walk in the late 1990s by Bartlett (Unpublished) indicates that most of the area, some 80 hectares, produced worked flint from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age with a smattering of Mesolithic. This indicates organised industry existed from 5000 BC to 2000 BC. The deposits are so large and dispersed that any major archaeological work in the area will have to take this into consideration before any ground work is started. Harlow was in Roman times the site of a small town (around [[Harlow Mill railway station]]) with a substantial stone built temple.<ref>Barry C. Burnham, J. S. Wacher: ''The Small Towns of Roman Britain'', Berkeley, Los Angeles 1990, pp. 186-187</ref>\n\n===Later history===\n[[File:St Mary's Church, Churchgate Street - geograph.org.uk - 1576708.jpg|thumb|[[St Mary & St Hugh, Old Harlow|St Mary's Church]], Churchgate Street]]\n\nThe entry in the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Domesday Book]] reads: ''Herlaua: St Edmunds Abbey before and after 1066; Geoffrey from Count Eustace; Thorgils from Eudo the Steward; Richard from Ranulf, brother of Ilger. Mill, 7 beehives, 8 cobs, 43 cattle, 3 foals.''

This includes for instance the Grade II listed [[St Mary & St Hugh, Old Harlow|St Mary's Church]] in Churchgate Street.  Its former Chapel is in a ruinous state in a field which was once the '''Harlowbury Abbey''' part of Old Harlow, is Grade I listed and is a [[scheduled ancient monument]].<ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1111694|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nKingsmoor House on Paringdon Road is a Grade II* listed building and dates from the 18th century. It was built as a gentleman's residence and owned by local families including the [[Harlow Woods|Risden]], [[John Archer-Houblon|Houblon]] and [[Edward Joseph Todhunter|Todhunter]] families. It was later used as a private school and council offices before falling derelict.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kingsmoor House - Harlow - May 2011 |url=https://www.derelictplaces.co.uk/main/residential-sites/18970-kingsmoor-house-harlow-2011-a.html |website=Derelict Places}}</ref> It has since been restored and converted into residential apartments.\n\n===The New Town===\n\nThe original Harlow [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] was built after [[World War II]] to ease overcrowding in London and the surrounding areas due to the devastation caused by the bombing during the Blitz. Harlow was, along with places such as [[Basildon]], [[Stevenage]] and [[Hemel Hempstead]] a result of the New Towns Act of 1946, with the master plan for Harlow drawn up in 1947 by Sir [[Frederick Gibberd]].<ref>[http://www.gardenvisit.com/b/gibberd.htm Gardens Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041020033303/http://www.gardenvisit.com/b/gibberd.htm |date=20 October 2004 }} \u2013 Frederick Gibberd</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8603701.stm New town, a name change and all the jazz] BBC News web site</ref> The town was planned from the outset and was designed to respect the existing landscape. A number of landscape wedges - which later became known as Green Wedges - were designed to cut through the town and separate the neighbourhoods of the town. The development incorporated the [[market town]] of Harlow, now a neighbourhood known as [[Old Harlow]], and the villages of Great Parndon, Latton, Tye Green, Potter Street, Churchgate Street, Little Parndon, and Netteswell. Each of the town's neighbourhoods is self-supporting with its own shopping precincts, community facilities and [[public house|pubs]]. Gibberd invited many of the country's leading post-war architects to design buildings in the town, including [[Philip Powell (architect)|Philip Powell]] and [[Hidalgo Moya]], [[Leonard Manasseh]], Michael Neylan, E C P Monson, Gerard Goalen, [[Maxwell Fry]], [[Jane Drew]], Graham Dawbarn, [[H. T. Cadbury-Brown]] and [[William Crabtree]].  Harlow has one of the most extensive cycle track networks in the country, connecting all areas of the town to the town centre and industrial areas.

Subsequently, many of the original town buildings, including most of its health centres, the Staple Tye shopping centre and many industrial units have been rebuilt. Gibberd's original town hall, a landmark in the town, has been demolished and replaced by a new civic centre and The Water Gardens shopping area.\n\n===Redevelopment===\n[[File:The Chase - geograph.org.uk - 400869.jpg|thumb|The Newhall housing development built circa 2007 between Old Harlow and Church Langley]]\n\nSince becoming a new town, Harlow has undergone several stages of expansion, the first of which was the \"mini expansion\" that was created by the building of the Sumners and Katherines estates in the mid-to-late seventies to the west of the existing town. Since then Harlow has further expanded with the Church Langley estate completed in 2005, and its newest neighbourhood [[Newhall, Essex|Newhall]] has completed the first stage of its development, with the second stage underway in 2013. The [[Harlow Gateway Scheme]] is currently underway, with the relocation of the Harlow Football Stadium to Barrow's Farm in early 2006, and the building of a new hotel, apartments, and a restaurant adjacent to the railway station being complete. The next stage of this scheme involves the completion of the 530 eco-homes being built on the former sports centre site, and the centre's relocation to the nearby former college playing field site.\n\nOther major developments under consideration include both a northern and southern bypass of the town, and significant expansion to the north, following the completed expansion to the east. The Harlow North<ref>[http://www.harlownorth.com Ropemaker Properties Limited] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305002149/http://www.harlownorth.com/ |date=5 March 2007 }} \u2013 Harlow North</ref> plans, currently awaiting permission, involve an extension of the town across the floodplains on the town's northern border, into neighbouring [[Hertfordshire]]. The plan was supported by former MP [[Bill Rammell]], all three political groups on Harlow Council, and the [[East of England Regional Assembly]]. It is opposed by Hertfordshire County Council, East Herts Council, [[Mark Prisk]], MP for Hertford and Stortford in whose constituency the development would be, and all the parishes concerned. The opposition is coordinated by a local group based in neighbouring East Hertfordshire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stopharlownorth.com|title=Page Redirection|website=www.stopharlownorth.com|accessdate=29 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105135104/http://www.stopharlownorth.com/|archivedate=5 January 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> An attempt to have Harlow North designated an \"Eco Town\" was rejected by the Minister for Housing, [[Caroline Flint]] MP, in April 2008.\n\nThe south of the town centre also underwent major regeneration, with the new Civic Centre being built and the town's famous Water Gardens being redeveloped, a landscape listed by [[English Heritage]].\n\nIn 2004 Harlow businessman [[Mohammad Ghadami|Mo Ghadami]] won his High Court case to block a multimillion-pound extension of the town's Harvey Centre. The Iranian-born entrepreneur, who presented his case in person, persuaded Mr Justice Richards to quash Harlow DC's grant of planning permission for the development. In his judgment he backed Mr Ghadami's claim of 'apparent bias or predetermination' in the decision, as a result of the continued participation of Michael Garnett, the chairman of the planning committee, in the planning process after he had attempted in telephone calls to persuade Mr Ghadami to consent to the scheme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lgcplus.com/harlow-planning-committee-chairmans-calls-to-objector-under-scrutiny/1231710.article|title=HARLOW PLANNING COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN'S CALLS TO OBJECTOR UNDER SCRUTINY|website=lgcplus.com|accessdate=29 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327014905/http://www.lgcplus.com/harlow-planning-committee-chairmans-calls-to-objector-under-scrutiny/1231710.article|archivedate=27 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011 the government announced the creation of an [[enterprise zone]] in the town.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-14552193 |title=New 'enterprise zones' announced around England |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |date=17 August 2011 |accessdate=10 March 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922152626/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-14552193 |archivedate=22 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Harlow Enterprise Zone consists of two separate sites under development, at Templefields and London Road, with the London Road site divided into north and south business parks.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.harlowstar.co.uk/Essex-County-Council-hand-experience-Harlow/story-25881332-detail/story.html |title=Essex County Council get first hand experience of Harlow Enterprise Zone |publisher=Harlow Star |date=17 January 2015 |accessdate=10 March 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402091437/http://www.harlowstar.co.uk/Essex-County-Council-hand-experience-Harlow/story-25881332-detail/story.html |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Permitted development (office to residential) flats===\nA flagship government policy to allow developers to convert office space to residential has led to a proliferation of new 'rabbit hutch' sized flats,<ref name=\"Jones2017\">{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Rupert |title=Welcome to rabbit-hutch Britain, land of the ever-shrinking home |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/feb/11/welcome-rabbit-hutch-britain-land-ever-shrinking-home |access-date=16 March 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=11 February 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Jones08\">{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Rupert |title=As small as 13 sq metres: are these the worst new flats in Britain? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/aug/25/flats-block-converting-offices-living-space |access-date=16 March 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=25 August 2018}}</ref> which are then let to London borough waiting list families.

Owned and run as a co-op, it provided employment to the town for over 50 years, before closing in 2002. It has since been demolished and the site now has small industrial units. At its peak, the factory employed over 500 people. At the time of its closure, the owner was Burton's Foods Ltd.

Having planned for one of the two big industrial estates to be built to the west of the town for easy motorway access, Sir Fredrick Gibberd was appalled when the motorway was eventually built to the east of the town instead, describing it as \"just about the most monstrous thing to ever happen to me as a planner\" during a 1982 interview.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gibberd|first1=Fredrick|title=Sir Fredrick Gibberd's - Harlow New Town 1982|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB3T5Gnfcu0&t=140s|website=Youtube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429145044/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB3T5Gnfcu0&t=140s|archivedate=29 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Running through the town is the [[A414 road|A414]], a major road from [[Hertford]] to [[Chelmsford]] and linking the town with the [[A10 road (England)|A10]] to the west. Another major road running from Harlow is the A1184, which also leads to the nearby town of [[Bishop's Stortford]].\n\n===Air===\n[[Bishop's Stortford]] is the closest large town to [[London Stansted Airport]], though Harlow is only 10 miles from this major transport hub, and therefore provides several hundred airport employees. The airport operator withdrew a planning application for a second runway after the General Election of 2010, when all major political parties opposed it.\n\n===Bus===\n[[File:Harlow bus station (geograph 3445799).jpg|thumb|right|Harlow Bus Station]]\nHarlow has an extensive bus network and serves as a regional hub for the local area, with operators such as Arriva (Herts and Essex) and Trustybus. There are links to many other local towns and villages such as Chelmsford City, Epping and Bishops Stortford.\n\n====Harlow First Avenue Multi-Modal Corridor====\n{{Infobox Future Infrastructure Project\n|property_name = Harlow First Avenue Multi-Modal Corridor\n|image_name = Harlow_developments.png\n|image_size = 200px\n|caption = Developments in and around Harlow.\n|location = Essex\n|proposer = Essex County Council\n|estimated cost = \u00a34.4&nbsp;million (2008)\n|planned start = \n|planned finish = February 2010\n|stakeholders = \n|geometry = [http://umapper.s3.amazonaws.com/maps/kml/45876.kml KML]\n}}\nEssex County Council was involved in development to Harlow's First Avenue, which was intended to reduce congestion and create better transport connections between the Newhall housing developments.
