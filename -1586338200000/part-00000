The Britsh [[Middle East Command]] with troops from the [[United Kingdom]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[British Raj|British India]], [[British Kenya|Kenya]], [[British Somaliland|Somaliland]], [[British West Africa|West Africa]], [[Northern Rhodesia|Northern]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]], [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Nyasaland]] participated in the campaign. These were joined by the Allied {{lang|fr|[[Force Publique]]}} of [[Belgian Congo]], [[Ethiopian Empire|Imperial Ethiopian]] [[Arbegnoch]] (resistance forces) and a small unit of [[Free French Forces|Free French]].\n\nItalian East Africa was defended by the {{lang|it|Comando Forze Armate dell'Africa Orientale Italiana}} (Italian East African Armed Forces Command), with units from the {{lang|it|[[Royal Italian Army|Regio Esercito]]}} (Royal Army), {{lang|it|[[Regia Aeronautica]]}} (Royal Air Force) and {{lang|it|[[Regia Marina]]}} (Royal Navy). The Italian forces included about 250,000 soldiers of the {{lang|it|[[Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali]]}} (Royal Corps of Colonial Troops), led by Italian officers and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]].  With Britain in control of the Suez canal, the Italian forces were cut off from supplies and reinforcement once hostilities began.\n\nOn 13 June 1940 an Italian air raid took place on the base of [[No. 237 Squadron RAF|237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF]] at [[Wajir]] in [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]] and continued until Italian forces had been pushed back from Kenya and Sudan, through Somaliland, Eritrea and Ethiopia in 1940 and early 1941. The remnants of the Italian forces in the region surrendered after the [[Battle of Gondar]] in November 1941, except for small groups that fought a [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia|guerrilla war in Ethiopia]] against the British until the [[Armistice of Cassibile]] in September 1943, which ended the war between Italy and the Allies. The East African campaign was the first Allied strategic victory in the war; few Italian forces escaped the region to be used in other campaigns and the Italian defeat greatly eased the flow of supplies through the Red Sea to Egypt. Most of the Commonwealth forces were transferred to North Africa to participate in the [[Western Desert Campaign]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===Italian East Africa===\n\n{{main article|Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Order of Battle, East African Campaign (World War II)}}\n\nOn 9 May 1936, the Italian dictator, [[Benito Mussolini]], proclaimed the formation of [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana'', AOI), from Ethiopia after the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] and the colonies of [[Italian Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland]].{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=2}} On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war on Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], which made Italian military forces in Libya a threat to Egypt and those in the AOI a danger to the British and French colonies in East Africa. Italian belligerence also closed the Mediterranean to Allied merchant ships and endangered British sea lanes along the coast of East Africa, the [[Gulf of Aden]], the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Suez Canal]]. (The [[Kingdom of Egypt]] remained [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] during the Second World War but the terms of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]] allowed the British to occupy Egypt and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].){{sfn|Playfair|1954|pp=6\u20137, 69}} Egypt, the Suez Canal, [[French Somaliland]] and [[British Somaliland]] were also vulnerable to invasion but ''Comando Supremo'' (Italian General Staff) had planned for a war after 1942; in the summer of 1940 Italy was far from ready for a long war or for the occupation of large areas of [[Africa]].{{sfn|Playfair|1954|pp=38\u201340}}\n\n===Italian forces in East Africa===\n====''Regio Esercito''====\n\n[[File:Italian East Africa.png|thumb|{{centre|The AOI in 1936.

On 1 June 1940, as the commander in chief of ''Comando Forze Armate dell'Africa Orientale Italiana'' (Italian East African Armed Forces Command) and ''Generale d'Armata Aerea'' (General of the Air Force), Aosta had about {{nowrap|290,476 local}} and metropolitan troops (including naval and air force personnel). By 1 August, mobilisation had increased the number to {{nowrap|371,053 troops.}}{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=93}} On 10 June, the Italian army was organised in four commands:\n* Northern Sector, vicinity of [[Asmara]]\n** Eritrea, Lieutenant-General [[Luigi Frusci]]\n* Southern Sector, around [[Jimma]]\n** Ethiopia, General [[Pietro Gazzera]]\n* Eastern Sector, General [[Guglielmo Nasi]] (borders of French and British Somaliland)\n* Giuba Sector, Lieutenant-General [[Carlo De Simone]], southern [[Somalia]] near [[Kismayo]], Italian Somaliland\n\n[[File:Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941).svg|thumb|{{centre|[[Italian East Africa]], May 1940, before the conquest of [[British Somaliland]]}}]]\nAosta had two metropolitan divisions, the [[40 Infantry Division Cacciatori d'Africa|40th Infantry Division ''Cacciatori d'Africa'']] and the [[65 Infantry Division Granatieri di Savoia|65th Infantry Division ''Granatieri di Savoia'']], a battalion of ''[[Alpini]]'' (elite mountain troops), a ''[[Bersaglieri]]'' battalion of motorised infantry, several \"[[Blackshirt]]\" ''[[Milizia Coloniale]]'' battalions and smaller units. About 70 percent of Italian troops were locally recruited [[Askari]]. The regular Eritrean battalions and the {{lang|it|Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali}} (RCTC [[Royal Corps of Somali Colonial Troops]]) were among the best Italian units in the AOI and included Eritrean cavalry {{lang|it|Penne di Falco}} (Falcon Feathers).{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=166}} (On one occasion a squadron of horse charged British and Commonwealth troops, throwing small hand grenades from the saddle.) Most colonial troops were recruited, trained and equipped for colonial repression, although the Somali [[Dubats]] from the borderlands were useful light infantry and skirmishers. Irregular ''[[Bands (Italian Army irregulars)|bandes]]'' were hardy and mobile, knew the country and were effective scouts and saboteurs, although sometimes confused with ''Shifta'', undisciplined marauders who plundered and murdered at will.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=55\u201356}} Once Italy entered the war, a 100-strong company formed out of German residents of East Africa and German sailors unable to leave East African ports.{{sfn|Schreiber|Stegemann|Vogel|1995|p=263}}\n\nItalian forces in East Africa were equipped with about {{nowrap|3,313 heavy}} machine-guns, {{nowrap|5,313 machine-guns,}} 24 [[M11/39]] medium tanks, 39 [[L3/35]] tankettes, {{nowrap|126 armoured cars}} and {{nowrap|824 guns,}} twenty-four {{nowrap|20 mm}} anti-aircraft guns, seventy-one {{nowrap|81 mm mortars}} and {{nowrap|672,800 rifles.}}{{sfn|Marino|2009|p=31}} Due to the isolation of the AOI from the Mediterranean, the Italians had very little opportunity for reinforcements or supply, leading to severe shortages, especially of ammunition.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=14}} On occasion, foreign merchant vessels captured by German [[merchant raider]]s in the [[Indian Ocean]] were brought to Somali ports but their cargoes were not always of much use to the Italian war effort. (For example, the Yugoslav steamer ''Durmitor'', captured by the German auxiliary cruiser ''[[German auxiliary cruiser Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', came to [[Warsheikh]] on 22 November 1940, with a cargo of salt and several hundred prisoners.){{sfn|Mohr|Sellwood|2009|p=126}}\n\n====''Regia Aeronautica''====\n[[File:Savoia-Marchetti S.M.79 flight in formation.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Savoia-Marchetti S.M.79 formation}}]]\nThe ''Comando Aeronautica Africa Orientale Italiana'' (CAAOI) of the ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' (General Pietro Pinna) based in Addis Ababa, had three sector commands corresponding to the land fronts,\n* ''Comando Settore Aeronautico Nord'' (Air Sector Headquarters North)\n* ''Comando Settore Aeronautico Est'' (Air Sector Headquarters West)\n* ''Comando Settore Aeronautico Sud'' (Air Sector Headquarters South)\nIn June 1940, there were {{nowrap|323 aircraft}} in the AOI, in {{nowrap|23 bomber}} squadrons with {{nowrap|138 aircraft,}} comprising {{nowrap|14 squadrons}} with six aircraft each, six [[Caproni Ca.133]] light bomber squadrons, seven [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.81]] squadrons and two squadrons of [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]]s.

Aircraft and engine maintenance was conducted at the main air bases and at the Caproni and Piaggio workshops, which could repair about fifteen seriously-damaged aircraft and engines each month, along with some moderately and lightly damaged aircraft and could also recycle scarce materials.{{sfn|Santoro|1957|p=146}} The Italians had reserves for 75% of their front-line strength but lacked spare parts and many aircraft were cannibalised to keep others operational.{{sfn|Shores|1996|pp=7\u20138}} The quality of the units varied.

The flotilla had seven fleet [[destroyers]], [[Leone-class destroyer]]s ''Pantera'', ''Leone'' and ''Tigre'' in the 5th Destroyer Division and the [[Sauro-class destroyer]]s ''Cesare Battisti'', ''Francesco Nullo'', ''Nazario Sauro'' and ''Daniele Manin'' in the 3rd Destroyer Division. The flotilla also had two local defence destroyers, the ''Orsini'' and ''Acerbi'', a squadron of five ''[[MAS (ships)|Motoscafo Armato Silurante]]'' (MAS, [[motor torpedo boats]])  and eight [[submarines]] (''Archimede'', ''Ferraris'', ''Galilei'', ''Torricelli'', ''Galvani'', ''Guglielmotto'', ''Macalle'' and ''Perla'').{{sfn|Roskill|1957|p=597}} When the Mediterranean route was closed to Allied merchant ships in April 1940, Allied convoys had to sail via the Cape and up the east coast of Africa, past the Italian naval bases to Suez. As Italian fuel supplies in Massawa dwindled, opportunities for the Red Sea Flotilla to attack Allied shipping declined.{{sfn|Roskill|1957|p=271}}\n\n===Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre===\n{{see also|Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|l1=Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre}}\n[[File:Africa1940.png|thumb|{{centre|Africa in 1940}}]]\nThe British had based [[History of modern Egypt|forces in Egypt]] since 1882 but these were greatly reduced by the terms of the [[Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936]]. A small British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] force garrisoned the Suez Canal and the Red Sea route, which was vital to British communications with its Indian Ocean and Far Eastern territories. In mid-1939, General [[Archibald Percival Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]] was appointed [[General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) of the new [[Middle East Command]], over the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean and Middle East]] theatres. Wavell was responsible for the defence of Egypt through the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, British Troops Egypt, to train the Egyptian army and co-ordinate military operations with the Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean, Admiral [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Andrew Cunningham]], the [[Commander-in-Chief, East Indies]], Vice-Admiral [[Ralph Leatham]], the [[Commander-in-Chief India]], General [[Robert Cassels]], the Inspector General, African Colonial Forces, Major-General [[Douglas Dickinson]] and the [[Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] [[RAF Middle East Command|Middle East]], Air Chief Marshal [[William Mitchell (RAF officer)|William Mitchell]].{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=39\u201340}}{{efn|Wavell also had to liaise with the ambassadors to Egypt and Iraq, the Governor-General of Sudan, the High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan, the governors of Cyprus, Aden and British Somaliland and the [[Political Resident]] in the Persian Gulf.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|p=39}}}} (French divisions in Tunisia faced the Italian [[Fifth Army (Italy)|5th Army]] on the western Libyan border, until the Franco-Axis [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]].)

In July 1939, Wavell devised a strategy to defend and then dominate the Mediterranean as a base to attack Germany, through eastern and south-east Europe. The conquest of Italian East Africa came second only to the defence of Egypt and the Suez Canal and in August Wavell ordered plans to be made quickly to gain control of the Red Sea. Wavell specified a concept of offensive operations from Djibouti to Harar and then Addis Ababa or Kassala to Asmara then Massawa, preferably on both lines simultaneously. Wavell reconnoitred East Africa in January 1940 and the theatre was formally added to his responsibilities; he expected that the Somalilands could be defended with minor reinforcement. If Italy joined the war Ethiopia would be invaded as soon as there were sufficient troops; Wavell also co-ordinated plans with South Africa in March. On 1 May 1940, Wavell ordered British Troops Egypt to discreetly mobilise for military operations in western Egypt but after the June ''d\u00e9b\u00e2cle'' in France, Wavell had no option but to follow a defensive strategy.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=169\u2013170, 67}}\n\nAfter Italian operations in Sudan at Kassala and Gallabat in June, Churchill blamed Wavell for a \"static policy\". [[Anthony Eden]], the [[Secretary of State for War]] communicated to Wavell that an Italian advance towards Khartoum should be destroyed. Wavell replied that the Italian attacks were not serious but went to Sudan and Kenya to see for himself and met the Ethiopian Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] at Khartoum.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=67, 72\u201373}} Eden convened a conference in Khartoum at the end of October 1940, with Selassie, the South African General [[Jan Smuts]] (advisor to [[Winston Churchill]]), Wavell. Lieutenant-General [[William Platt]] and Lieutenant-General [[Alan Cunningham]]. A plan to attack Ethiopia, including Ethiopian irregular forces, was agreed.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=245}} In November 1940, the British gained an intelligence advantage when the [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC & CS) at [[Bletchley Park]] broke the high grade cypher of the Italian army in East Africa. Later that month, the replacement cypher for the ''Regia Aeronautica'' was broken by the Combined Bureau, Middle East (CBME).{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=247}}\n\nIn September 1940, Wavell ordered the commanders in Sudan and Kenya to make limited attacks once the rainy season ended. On the northern front, Platt was to attack Gallabat and vicinity and on the southern front, Cunningham was to advance northwards from Kenya, through Italian Somaliland into Ethiopia. At the start of November 1940, Cunningham had taken over the East African Force from Major-General D. P. Dickinson, who was in poor health. While Platt advanced from the north and Cunningham from the south, Wavell planned for a third force to be landed in British Somaliland by amphibious assault to re-take the colony, prior to advancing into Ethiopia; the three forces were to rendezvous at Addis Ababa. The conquest of the AOI would remove the land threat to supplies and reinforcements coming from Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa and British East Africa via the Suez Canal for the [[Western Desert campaign]] and re-open the land route from [[Cape Town]] to Cairo.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=168\u2013173}}\n\n====East Africa Force====\n[[File:Africa (Eastern region).png|thumb|{{centre|General definition of East Africa (2005)}}]]\nIn 1940, [[East Africa Force]] (Major-General D.

In September, Colonel [[Daniel Sandford (soldier)|D. A.

In June 1940, Selassie arrived in Egypt and in July, went to Sudan to meet Platt and discuss plans to re-capture Ethiopia, despite Platt's reservations.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=155}} In July, the British recognised Selassie as emperor and in August, Mission 101 entered Gojjam province to reconnoitre. Sandford requested that supply routes be established before the rains ended, to the area north of Lake Tana and that Selassie should return in October, as a catalyst for the uprising. Gaining control of Gojjam required the Italian garrisons to be isolated along the main road from Bahrdar Giorgis south of Lake Tana, to Dangila, Debra Markos and Addis Ababa to prevent them concentrating against the ''[[Patriots (Ethiopia)|Arbegnoch]]'' ([[Amharic]] for Patriots).{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=403}}\n\nItalian reinforcements arrived in October and patrolled more frequently, just as dissensions among local potentates were reconciled by Sandford's diplomacy.{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=403}} The Frontier Battalion of the Sudan Defence Force, set up in May 1940, was joined at Khartoum by the 2nd Ethiopian and 4th Eritrean battalions, raised from \u00e9migr\u00e9 volunteers in Kenya. Operational Centres consisting of an officer, five NCOs and several picked Ethiopians were formed and trained in guerrilla warfare to provide leadership cadres and \u00a31 million was set aside to finance operations.

The suggestion was accepted by the British government but because of the concessions granted to the Vichy regime in Syria, proposals were made to invade the colony instead.

For six months, Nouailhetas remained willing to grant concessions over the port and railway but would not tolerate Free French interference. In October the blockade was reviewed but the beginning of the war with Japan in December, led to all but two blockade ships being withdrawn.

In December 1940, Clarke constructed a model operation for Italian military intelligence to discover and set up administration offices at Aden. Clarke arranged for the Italian defences around Berbera to be softened up by air and sea raids from Aden and distributed maps and pamphlets on the climate, geography and population of British Somaliland; \"Sibs\" (''sibilare'', hisses or whistles), were circulated among civilians in Egypt. Bogus information was planted on the Japanese consul at Port Said and indiscreet wireless messages were transmitted. The operation began on 19 December 1940 and was to mature early in January 1941; the deception was a success.

While {{HMS|Eagle|1918|6}} was waiting to pass from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean, [[813 Naval Air Squadron]] and [[824 Naval Air Squadron]], with 17 Swordfish torpedo bombers had been disembarked and flown to port Sudan.{{sfn|Shores|1996|pp=138\u2013139}}\n\nOn 2 April two Swordfish bombed a freighter at Makra and at dawn on 3 April, a search by six of the Swordfish began at {{nowrap|4:30 a.m.}} At {{nowrap|5:11 a.m.}} another Swordfish spotted four Italian destroyers {{convert|20|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} east of Port Sudan.

One Swordfish remained to shadow the ships as the Swordfish returned to rearm and at {{nowrap|8:13 a.m.}} seven Swordfish attacked, one aircraft from the rear and one from each side. ''Nazario Sauro'' was hit by all six bombs from one Swordfish and quickly sank; casualties were caused to the other three ships by near-misses.{{sfn|Shores|1996|pp=138\u2013139}} Five Blenheims of 14 Squadron RAF arrived in time to see ''Nazario Sauro'' hit and attacked a stationary destroyer and reported that its crew abandoned ship; it was set on fire, exploded and sank; ''Cesare Battisti'' was later found beached on the Arabian coast. At {{nowrap|10:10 a.m.}} another four Swordfish found the Italian destroyers {{cvt|100|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} distant. ''Daniele Manin'' was hit amidships by two bombs and the crew abandoned ship; three Swordfish obtained near-misses.

''Pantera'' and ''Tigre'' were found {{cvt|12|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} south of [[Jeddah]], where they were being abandoned and were attacked by Blenheims of 14 Squadron and Wellesleys of 223 Squadron from Port Sudan which claimed hits on both ships, one catching fire.

At {{nowrap|5:19 a.m.}} the troops disembarked on the pier unopposed; two Italian generals were taken prisoner in their beds and the success signal was fired at {{nowrap|6:00 a.m.}} The flotilla entered the harbour behind a minesweeper and landed the rest of the Punjabis, who sent parties to search the islands nearby and found them to be unoccupied. At {{nowrap|7:00 a.m.}} the Civil Governor was taken to ''Dido'' and surrendered Assab to the Senior Officer [[Red Sea Station|Red Sea Force]] (Rear-Admiral [[R. H. C.

Bolla disclosed the positions of three minefields in the approaches to the harbour and said that the channel to the east, north of Ras Fatma, was clear. The 3/15th Punjabis took {{nowrap|547 prisoners}} along with the two generals and {{nowrap|35 Germans.}} On 13 June, the Indian trawler ''Parvati'' struck a magnetic mine near Assab and became the last naval casualty of the campaign.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=64\u201365, 58\u201359}}\n\n===Kulkaber (Culqualber)===\n{{main article|Battle of Culqualber|Siege of Sa\u00efo}}\n\n[[File:Force Publique leaving for Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|{{centre|''[[Force Publique]]'' soldiers leaving the Congo to participate in the East African campaign}}]]\nA force under General [[Pietro Gazzera]], the Governor of Galla-Sidama and the new acting Viceroy and Governor-General of the AOI was faced with a growing irregular force of ''Arbegnoch'' and many local units melted away. On 21 June 1941, Gazzera abandoned Jimma and about {{nowrap|15,000 men}} surrendered. On 3 July, the Italians were cut off by the [[Free Belgian forces]] (Major-General [[Auguste Gilliaert]]) who had defeated the Italians at [[Asosa]] and [[Dembidolo|Sa\u00efo]].{{sfn|Weller|2010|p=117}} On 6 July, Gazzera and {{nowrap|2,944 Italian,}} {{nowrap|1,535 African}} and {{nowrap|2,000 ''bande''}} formally surrendered; the 79th Colonial Battalion changed sides and was renamed the 79th Foot as did a company of banda as the Wollo Banda.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=309\u2013314}}{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=217\u2013219}}\n\nWolchefit Pass was a position whose control was needed to launch the final attack on Gondar, was defended by a garrison of about {{nowrap|4,000 men}} (Colonel Mario Gonella) in localities distributed in depth for about {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The stronghold had been besieged by irregular Ethiopian forces, led by Major B. J. Ringrose, since May and on 5 May the Italians retreated from Amba Giorgis. The besieging force was later augmented by the arrival of the 3/14th Punjab Battalion from the Indian Army and part of the 12th African Division. Several attacks, counter-attacks and sorties were launched between May and August 1941. On 28 September 1941, after losing {{nowrap|950 casualties}} and running out of provisions, Gonella surrendered with {{nowrap|1,629 Italian}} and {{nowrap|1,450 Ethiopian}} soldiers to the 25th East African Brigade (Brigadier W.

After Gazzera surrendered, Nasi, the acting Governor of Amhara, became the new acting Viceroy and Governor-General of the AOI. At Gondar, Nasi faced the British and a growing number of Ethiopian Patriots but held out for almost seven months. While the ''Regia Aeronautica'' in East Africa had been worn down quickly by attrition, the Italian pilots fought on to the end.{{sfn|Mollo|McGregor|Turner|1981|p=91}} After the death of his commander Tenente Malavolti on 31 October, Sergente Giuseppe Mottet became the last Italian fighter pilot in the AOI and on 20 November, flew the last ''Regia Aeronautica'' sortie, a ground-attack operation in the last CR.42 (MM4033) against British artillery positions at Culqualber. Mottet fired one burst and killed Lieutenant-Colonel Ormsby, the CRA.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=319}} On landing, Mottet destroyed the CR.42, joined the Italian troops and fought on until the surrender.{{sfn|Gustavsson|2014|nopp=y}} On 27 November, Nasi surrendered with {{nowrap|10,000 Italian}} and {{nowrap|12,000 African}} troops, British losses being {{nowrap|32 men}} killed, {{nowrap|182 wounded,}} six men missing and {{nowrap|15 aircraft}} shot down since 7 April.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=321}} In 1949, Maravigna recorded Italian casualties of {{nowrap|4,000 killed}} and {{nowrap|8,400 sick}} and wounded.{{sfn|Maravigna|1949|p=191}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\n\nIn 2016, A. Stewart wrote that due to the British defeats in Greece and Crete the East African campaign has been overshadowed, although it was the first victory for the Allies in the Second World War.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=ix}} In 2004, the American historian [[Douglas Porch]] wrote that the \"pearl of the fascist regime\" had lasted only five years, the performance of the Italian army exceeded that in North Africa but there had still been a high ratio of prisoners to casualties. Mass defections by local forces suggested that Fascist imperialism had made little impression on the East African public. The Italian navy at Massawa had shown a \"stunning\" lack of energy and failed to challenge British access to Mombasa and Port Sudan or the landing at Berbera. The army had failed to exploit British supply difficulties and had left stores behind for the British to use. The British had withdrawn the 4th Indian Division and RAF squadrons for North Africa in February 1941, despite the Italian forces remaining at Amba Alagi, which from 20 April to 15 May, were steadily pressed back until they surrendered on 19 May.{{sfn|Porch|2005|pp=137\u2013138}}\n\nEthiopia, the Somalilands and Eritrea had been conquered by the British and the end of organised Italian resistance, led to the East Africa Force and Air Headquarters East Africa being reduced by the transfer of the South African and the two Indian divisions to Egypt, along with three fighter, three bomber and a reconnaissance squadron, followed by two more in late May. The 11th and 12th (African) divisions remained, supported by six RAF and SAAF squadrons.{{sfn|Playfair|1954|pp=449\u2013450}} The Italians at Galla-Sidom and Gondar were mopped up and the final surrender was taken by the Belgian contingent from Congo. Mussolini blamed the disaster on the \"deficiency of the Italian race\" but the Fascist regime survived and the British victory had little influence on Japanese strategy in the Far East.{{sfn|Porch|2005|pp=137\u2013138}} With the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden cleared of [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] forces, Roosevelt declared that the areas were no longer combat zones on 11 April 1941. Ships of the United States were able to proceed to the Suez Canal, which helped to relieve the strain on British shipping resources.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=247}}\n\n===Signals intelligence===\nThe Italians had replaced their ciphers in the AOI in November 1940 but by the end of the month, the GC&CS in England and the Cipher Bureau Middle East (CBME) in Cairo had broken the new ''Regio Esercito'' and ''Regia Aeronautica'' ciphers. By 1941, sufficient low-grade ciphers had been broken to reveal the Italian order of battle and the supply situation, by the time that the British offensive began on 19 January 1941. Italian dependence on wireless communication, using frequencies on which it was easy for the British to eavesdrop, led to a flood of information, from the daily report from the Viceroy, to the operational plans of the ''Regia Aeronautica'' and ''Regia Esercito'' on the retreat from Keren.{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|pp=64\u201365}} On occasion, British commanders had messages before the recipients and it was reported later by the Deputy Director Military Intelligence in Cairo, that\n\n{{quote|...he could not believe that any army commander in the field had [ever] been better served by his intelligence....|DDMI (ME){{sfn|Hinsley|1994|pp=64\u201365}}}}\n\n===Casualties===\nOn 16 April 1941, the authorities in the AOI signalled to Rome that {{nowrap|426 officers}} had been killed, {{nowrap|703 wounded}} and {{nowrap|315 captured,}} during military operations before the surrender.

[[Amedeo Guillet]] was one of the Italian officers who fought with the Italian guerrillas in Ethiopia. Another notable guerrilla leader was [[Hamid Idris Awate]], a father of the [[Eritrean Liberation Front]]. Other Italian officers were Captain [[Francesco De Martini]] in Eritrea, Colonel Calderari in western Ethiopia/Somalia, Colonel Di Marco in Ogaden/British Somaliland \"blackshirt centurion\" De Varda in Somalia/Ethiopia and Major Lucchetti in Ethiopia. Civilians participated and in August 1942, forces led by Dr. [[Rosa Dainelli]] sabotaged the main British ammunition dump in Addis Ababa.{{sfn|Roselli|2007|p=58}} Hostilities in East Africa officially ceased on 9 September 1943, when the Italian government signed the [[Armistice with Italy]].

[[Makonnen Endelkachew]] was named as Prime Minister and on 19 December 1944, the final Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement was signed. Eritrea was placed under British military administration for the duration and in 1950, it became part of Ethiopia. After 1945, Britain controlled both Somalilands, as [[protectorate]]s.

The Britsh [[Middle East Command]] with troops from the [[United Kingdom]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[British Raj|British India]], [[British Kenya|Kenya]], [[British Somaliland|Somaliland]], [[British West Africa|West Africa]], [[Northern Rhodesia|Northern]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]], [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Nyasaland]] participated in the campaign. These were joined by the Allied {{lang|fr|[[Force Publique]]}} of [[Belgian Congo]], [[Ethiopian Empire|Imperial Ethiopian]] [[Arbegnoch]] (resistance forces) and a small unit of [[Free French Forces|Free French]].\n\nItalian East Africa was defended by the {{lang|it|Comando Forze Armate dell'Africa Orientale Italiana}} (Italian East African Armed Forces Command), with units from the {{lang|it|[[Royal Italian Army|Regio Esercito]]}} (Royal Army), {{lang|it|[[Regia Aeronautica]]}} (Royal Air Force) and {{lang|it|[[Regia Marina]]}} (Royal Navy). The Italian forces included about 250,000 soldiers of the {{lang|it|[[Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali]]}} (Royal Corps of Colonial Troops), led by Italian officers and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]].  With Britain in control of the Suez canal, the Italian forces were cut off from supplies and reinforcement once hostilities began.\n\nOn 13 June 1940 an Italian air raid took place on the base of [[No. 237 Squadron RAF|237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF]] at [[Wajir]] in [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]] and continued until Italian forces had been pushed back from Kenya and Sudan, through Somaliland, Eritrea and Ethiopia in 1940 and early 1941. The remnants of the Italian forces in the region surrendered after the [[Battle of Gondar]] in November 1941, except for small groups that fought a [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia|guerrilla war in Ethiopia]] against the British until the [[Armistice of Cassibile]] in September 1943, which ended the war between Italy and the Allies. The East African campaign was the first Allied strategic victory in the war; few Italian forces escaped the region to be used in other campaigns and the Italian defeat greatly eased the flow of supplies through the Red Sea to Egypt. Most of the Commonwealth forces were transferred to North Africa to participate in the [[Western Desert Campaign]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===Italian East Africa===\n\n{{main article|Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Order of Battle, East African Campaign (World War II)}}\n\nOn 9 May 1936, the Italian dictator, [[Benito Mussolini]], proclaimed the formation of [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana'', AOI), from Ethiopia after the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] and the colonies of [[Italian Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland]].{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=2}} On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war on Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], which made Italian military forces in Libya a threat to Egypt and those in the AOI a danger to the British and French colonies in East Africa. Italian belligerence also closed the Mediterranean to Allied merchant ships and endangered British sea lanes along the coast of East Africa, the [[Gulf of Aden]], the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Suez Canal]]. (The [[Kingdom of Egypt]] remained [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] during the Second World War but the terms of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]] allowed the British to occupy Egypt and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].){{sfn|Playfair|1954|pp=6\u20137, 69}} Egypt, the Suez Canal, [[French Somaliland]] and [[British Somaliland]] were also vulnerable to invasion but ''Comando Supremo'' (Italian General Staff) had planned for a war after 1942; in the summer of 1940 Italy was far from ready for a long war or for the occupation of large areas of [[Africa]].{{sfn|Playfair|1954|pp=38\u201340}}\n\n===Italian forces in East Africa===\n====''Regio Esercito''====\n\n[[File:Italian East Africa.png|thumb|{{centre|The AOI in 1936.

About 70 percent of Italian troops were locally recruited [[Askari]]. The regular Eritrean battalions and the {{lang|it|Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali}} (RCTC [[Royal Corps of Somali Colonial Troops]]) were among the best Italian units in the AOI and included Eritrean cavalry {{lang|it|Penne di Falco}} (Falcon Feathers).{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=166}} (On one occasion a squadron of horse charged British and Commonwealth troops, throwing small hand grenades from the saddle.) Most colonial troops were recruited, trained and equipped for colonial repression, although the Somali [[Dubats]] from the borderlands were useful light infantry and skirmishers. Irregular ''[[Bands (Italian Army irregulars)|bandes]]'' were hardy and mobile, knew the country and were effective scouts and saboteurs, although sometimes confused with ''Shifta'', undisciplined marauders who plundered and murdered at will.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=55\u201356}} Once Italy entered the war, a 100-strong company formed out of German residents of East Africa and German sailors unable to leave East African ports.{{sfn|Schreiber|Stegemann|Vogel|1995|p=263}}\n\nItalian forces in East Africa were equipped with about {{nowrap|3,313 heavy}} machine-guns, {{nowrap|5,313 machine-guns,}} 24 [[M11/39]] medium tanks, 39 [[L3/35]] tankettes, {{nowrap|126 armoured cars}} and {{nowrap|824 guns,}} twenty-four {{nowrap|20 mm}} anti-aircraft guns, seventy-one {{nowrap|81 mm mortars}} and {{nowrap|672,800 rifles.}}{{sfn|Marino|2009|p=31}} Due to the isolation of the AOI from the Mediterranean, the Italians had very little opportunity for reinforcements or supply, leading to severe shortages, especially of ammunition.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=14}} On occasion, foreign merchant vessels captured by German [[merchant raider]]s in the [[Indian Ocean]] were brought to Somali ports but their cargoes were not always of much use to the Italian war effort. (For example, the Yugoslav steamer ''Durmitor'', captured by the German auxiliary cruiser ''[[German auxiliary cruiser Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', came to [[Warsheikh]] on 22 November 1940, with a cargo of salt and several hundred prisoners.){{sfn|Mohr|Sellwood|2009|p=126}}\n\n====''Regia Aeronautica''====\n[[File:Savoia-Marchetti S.M.79 flight in formation.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Savoia-Marchetti S.M.79 formation}}]]\nThe ''Comando Aeronautica Africa Orientale Italiana'' (CAAOI) of the ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' (General Pietro Pinna) based in Addis Ababa, had three sector commands corresponding to the land fronts,\n* ''Comando Settore Aeronautico Nord'' (Air Sector Headquarters North)\n* ''Comando Settore Aeronautico Est'' (Air Sector Headquarters West)\n* ''Comando Settore Aeronautico Sud'' (Air Sector Headquarters South)\nIn June 1940, there were {{nowrap|323 aircraft}} in the AOI, in {{nowrap|23 bomber}} squadrons with {{nowrap|138 aircraft,}} comprising {{nowrap|14 squadrons}} with six aircraft each, six [[Caproni Ca.133]] light bomber squadrons, seven [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.81]] squadrons and two squadrons of [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]]s.

The flotilla had seven fleet [[destroyers]], [[Leone-class destroyer]]s ''Pantera'', ''Leone'' and ''Tigre'' in the 5th Destroyer Division and the [[Sauro-class destroyer]]s ''Cesare Battisti'', ''Francesco Nullo'', ''Nazario Sauro'' and ''Daniele Manin'' in the 3rd Destroyer Division.

As Italian fuel supplies in Massawa dwindled, opportunities for the Red Sea Flotilla to attack Allied shipping declined.{{sfn|Roskill|1957|p=271}}\n\n===Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre===\n{{see also|Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|l1=Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre}}\n[[File:Africa1940.png|thumb|{{centre|Africa in 1940}}]]\nThe British had based [[History of modern Egypt|forces in Egypt]] since 1882 but these were greatly reduced by the terms of the [[Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936]]. A small British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] force garrisoned the Suez Canal and the Red Sea route, which was vital to British communications with its Indian Ocean and Far Eastern territories. In mid-1939, General [[Archibald Percival Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]] was appointed [[General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) of the new [[Middle East Command]], over the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean and Middle East]] theatres.

In July 1939, Wavell devised a strategy to defend and then dominate the Mediterranean as a base to attack Germany, through eastern and south-east Europe. The conquest of Italian East Africa came second only to the defence of Egypt and the Suez Canal and in August Wavell ordered plans to be made quickly to gain control of the Red Sea. Wavell specified a concept of offensive operations from Djibouti to Harar and then Addis Ababa or Kassala to Asmara then Massawa, preferably on both lines simultaneously. Wavell reconnoitred East Africa in January 1940 and the theatre was formally added to his responsibilities; he expected that the Somalilands could be defended with minor reinforcement. If Italy joined the war Ethiopia would be invaded as soon as there were sufficient troops; Wavell also co-ordinated plans with South Africa in March. On 1 May 1940, Wavell ordered British Troops Egypt to discreetly mobilise for military operations in western Egypt but after the June ''d\u00e9b\u00e2cle'' in France, Wavell had no option but to follow a defensive strategy.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=169\u2013170, 67}}\n\nAfter Italian operations in Sudan at Kassala and Gallabat in June, Churchill blamed Wavell for a \"static policy\". [[Anthony Eden]], the [[Secretary of State for War]] communicated to Wavell that an Italian advance towards Khartoum should be destroyed. Wavell replied that the Italian attacks were not serious but went to Sudan and Kenya to see for himself and met the Ethiopian Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] at Khartoum.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=67, 72\u201373}} Eden convened a conference in Khartoum at the end of October 1940, with Selassie, the South African General [[Jan Smuts]] (advisor to [[Winston Churchill]]), Wavell. Lieutenant-General [[William Platt]] and Lieutenant-General [[Alan Cunningham]]. A plan to attack Ethiopia, including Ethiopian irregular forces, was agreed.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=245}} In November 1940, the British gained an intelligence advantage when the [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC & CS) at [[Bletchley Park]] broke the high grade cypher of the Italian army in East Africa. Later that month, the replacement cypher for the ''Regia Aeronautica'' was broken by the Combined Bureau, Middle East (CBME).{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=247}}\n\nIn September 1940, Wavell ordered the commanders in Sudan and Kenya to make limited attacks once the rainy season ended. On the northern front, Platt was to attack Gallabat and vicinity and on the southern front, Cunningham was to advance northwards from Kenya, through Italian Somaliland into Ethiopia. At the start of November 1940, Cunningham had taken over the East African Force from Major-General D. P. Dickinson, who was in poor health. While Platt advanced from the north and Cunningham from the south, Wavell planned for a third force to be landed in British Somaliland by amphibious assault to re-take the colony, prior to advancing into Ethiopia; the three forces were to rendezvous at Addis Ababa. The conquest of the AOI would remove the land threat to supplies and reinforcements coming from Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa and British East Africa via the Suez Canal for the [[Western Desert campaign]] and re-open the land route from [[Cape Town]] to Cairo.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=168\u2013173}}\n\n====East Africa Force====\n[[File:Africa (Eastern region).png|thumb|{{centre|General definition of East Africa (2005)}}]]\nIn 1940, [[East Africa Force]] (Major-General D.

Sandford requested that supply routes be established before the rains ended, to the area north of Lake Tana and that Selassie should return in October, as a catalyst for the uprising. Gaining control of Gojjam required the Italian garrisons to be isolated along the main road from Bahrdar Giorgis south of Lake Tana, to Dangila, Debra Markos and Addis Ababa to prevent them concentrating against the ''[[Patriots (Ethiopia)|Arbegnoch]]'' ([[Amharic]] for Patriots).{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=403}}\n\nItalian reinforcements arrived in October and patrolled more frequently, just as dissensions among local potentates were reconciled by Sandford's diplomacy.{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=403}} The Frontier Battalion of the Sudan Defence Force, set up in May 1940, was joined at Khartoum by the 2nd Ethiopian and 4th Eritrean battalions, raised from \u00e9migr\u00e9 volunteers in Kenya. Operational Centres consisting of an officer, five NCOs and several picked Ethiopians were formed and trained in guerrilla warfare to provide leadership cadres and \u00a31 million was set aside to finance operations.

The suggestion was accepted by the British government but because of the concessions granted to the Vichy regime in Syria, proposals were made to invade the colony instead.

For six months, Nouailhetas remained willing to grant concessions over the port and railway but would not tolerate Free French interference. In October the blockade was reviewed but the beginning of the war with Japan in December, led to all but two blockade ships being withdrawn.

In December 1940, Clarke constructed a model operation for Italian military intelligence to discover and set up administration offices at Aden. Clarke arranged for the Italian defences around Berbera to be softened up by air and sea raids from Aden and distributed maps and pamphlets on the climate, geography and population of British Somaliland; \"Sibs\" (''sibilare'', hisses or whistles), were circulated among civilians in Egypt. Bogus information was planted on the Japanese consul at Port Said and indiscreet wireless messages were transmitted. The operation began on 19 December 1940 and was to mature early in January 1941; the deception was a success.

While {{HMS|Eagle|1918|6}} was waiting to pass from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean, [[813 Naval Air Squadron]] and [[824 Naval Air Squadron]], with 17 Swordfish torpedo bombers had been disembarked and flown to port Sudan.{{sfn|Shores|1996|pp=138\u2013139}}\n\nOn 2 April two Swordfish bombed a freighter at Makra and at dawn on 3 April, a search by six of the Swordfish began at {{nowrap|4:30 a.m.}} At {{nowrap|5:11 a.m.}} another Swordfish spotted four Italian destroyers {{convert|20|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} east of Port Sudan.

One Swordfish remained to shadow the ships as the Swordfish returned to rearm and at {{nowrap|8:13 a.m.}} seven Swordfish attacked, one aircraft from the rear and one from each side. ''Nazario Sauro'' was hit by all six bombs from one Swordfish and quickly sank; casualties were caused to the other three ships by near-misses.{{sfn|Shores|1996|pp=138\u2013139}} Five Blenheims of 14 Squadron RAF arrived in time to see ''Nazario Sauro'' hit and attacked a stationary destroyer and reported that its crew abandoned ship; it was set on fire, exploded and sank; ''Cesare Battisti'' was later found beached on the Arabian coast. At {{nowrap|10:10 a.m.}} another four Swordfish found the Italian destroyers {{cvt|100|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} distant. ''Daniele Manin'' was hit amidships by two bombs and the crew abandoned ship; three Swordfish obtained near-misses.

''Pantera'' and ''Tigre'' were found {{cvt|12|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} south of [[Jeddah]], where they were being abandoned and were attacked by Blenheims of 14 Squadron and Wellesleys of 223 Squadron from Port Sudan which claimed hits on both ships, one catching fire.

At {{nowrap|5:19 a.m.}} the troops disembarked on the pier unopposed; two Italian generals were taken prisoner in their beds and the success signal was fired at {{nowrap|6:00 a.m.}} The flotilla entered the harbour behind a minesweeper and landed the rest of the Punjabis, who sent parties to search the islands nearby and found them to be unoccupied. At {{nowrap|7:00 a.m.}} the Civil Governor was taken to ''Dido'' and surrendered Assab to the Senior Officer [[Red Sea Station|Red Sea Force]] (Rear-Admiral [[R. H. C.

Bolla disclosed the positions of three minefields in the approaches to the harbour and said that the channel to the east, north of Ras Fatma, was clear. The 3/15th Punjabis took {{nowrap|547 prisoners}} along with the two generals and {{nowrap|35 Germans.}} On 13 June, the Indian trawler ''Parvati'' struck a magnetic mine near Assab and became the last naval casualty of the campaign.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=64\u201365, 58\u201359}}\n\n===Kulkaber (Culqualber)===\n{{main article|Battle of Culqualber|Siege of Sa\u00efo}}\n\n[[File:Force Publique leaving for Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|{{centre|''[[Force Publique]]'' soldiers leaving the Congo to participate in the East African campaign}}]]\nA force under General [[Pietro Gazzera]], the Governor of Galla-Sidama and the new acting Viceroy and Governor-General of the AOI was faced with a growing irregular force of ''Arbegnoch'' and many local units melted away. On 21 June 1941, Gazzera abandoned Jimma and about {{nowrap|15,000 men}} surrendered. On 3 July, the Italians were cut off by the [[Free Belgian forces]] (Major-General [[Auguste Gilliaert]]) who had defeated the Italians at [[Asosa]] and [[Dembidolo|Sa\u00efo]].{{sfn|Weller|2010|p=117}} On 6 July, Gazzera and {{nowrap|2,944 Italian,}} {{nowrap|1,535 African}} and {{nowrap|2,000 ''bande''}} formally surrendered; the 79th Colonial Battalion changed sides and was renamed the 79th Foot as did a company of banda as the Wollo Banda.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=309\u2013314}}{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=217\u2013219}}\n\nWolchefit Pass was a position whose control was needed to launch the final attack on Gondar, was defended by a garrison of about {{nowrap|4,000 men}} (Colonel Mario Gonella) in localities distributed in depth for about {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The stronghold had been besieged by irregular Ethiopian forces, led by Major B. J. Ringrose, since May and on 5 May the Italians retreated from Amba Giorgis. The besieging force was later augmented by the arrival of the 3/14th Punjab Battalion from the Indian Army and part of the 12th African Division. Several attacks, counter-attacks and sorties were launched between May and August 1941. On 28 September 1941, after losing {{nowrap|950 casualties}} and running out of provisions, Gonella surrendered with {{nowrap|1,629 Italian}} and {{nowrap|1,450 Ethiopian}} soldiers to the 25th East African Brigade (Brigadier W.

After Gazzera surrendered, Nasi, the acting Governor of Amhara, became the new acting Viceroy and Governor-General of the AOI. At Gondar, Nasi faced the British and a growing number of Ethiopian Patriots but held out for almost seven months. While the ''Regia Aeronautica'' in East Africa had been worn down quickly by attrition, the Italian pilots fought on to the end.{{sfn|Mollo|McGregor|Turner|1981|p=91}} After the death of his commander Tenente Malavolti on 31 October, Sergente Giuseppe Mottet became the last Italian fighter pilot in the AOI and on 20 November, flew the last ''Regia Aeronautica'' sortie, a ground-attack operation in the last CR.42 (MM4033) against British artillery positions at Culqualber. Mottet fired one burst and killed Lieutenant-Colonel Ormsby, the CRA.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=319}} On landing, Mottet destroyed the CR.42, joined the Italian troops and fought on until the surrender.{{sfn|Gustavsson|2014|nopp=y}} On 27 November, Nasi surrendered with {{nowrap|10,000 Italian}} and {{nowrap|12,000 African}} troops, British losses being {{nowrap|32 men}} killed, {{nowrap|182 wounded,}} six men missing and {{nowrap|15 aircraft}} shot down since 7 April.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=321}} In 1949, Maravigna recorded Italian casualties of {{nowrap|4,000 killed}} and {{nowrap|8,400 sick}} and wounded.{{sfn|Maravigna|1949|p=191}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\n\nIn 2016, A. Stewart wrote that due to the British defeats in Greece and Crete the East African campaign has been overshadowed, although it was the first victory for the Allies in the Second World War.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=ix}} In 2004, the American historian [[Douglas Porch]] wrote that the \"pearl of the fascist regime\" had lasted only five years, the performance of the Italian army exceeded that in North Africa but there had still been a high ratio of prisoners to casualties. Mass defections by local forces suggested that Fascist imperialism had made little impression on the East African public. The Italian navy at Massawa had shown a \"stunning\" lack of energy and failed to challenge British access to Mombasa and Port Sudan or the landing at Berbera. The army had failed to exploit British supply difficulties and had left stores behind for the British to use. The British had withdrawn the 4th Indian Division and RAF squadrons for North Africa in February 1941, despite the Italian forces remaining at Amba Alagi, which from 20 April to 15 May, were steadily pressed back until they surrendered on 19 May.{{sfn|Porch|2005|pp=137\u2013138}}\n\nEthiopia, the Somalilands and Eritrea had been conquered by the British and the end of organised Italian resistance, led to the East Africa Force and Air Headquarters East Africa being reduced by the transfer of the South African and the two Indian divisions to Egypt, along with three fighter, three bomber and a reconnaissance squadron, followed by two more in late May. The 11th and 12th (African) divisions remained, supported by six RAF and SAAF squadrons.{{sfn|Playfair|1954|pp=449\u2013450}} The Italians at Galla-Sidom and Gondar were mopped up and the final surrender was taken by the Belgian contingent from Congo. Mussolini blamed the disaster on the \"deficiency of the Italian race\" but the Fascist regime survived and the British victory had little influence on Japanese strategy in the Far East.{{sfn|Porch|2005|pp=137\u2013138}} With the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden cleared of [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] forces, Roosevelt declared that the areas were no longer combat zones on 11 April 1941. Ships of the United States were able to proceed to the Suez Canal, which helped to relieve the strain on British shipping resources.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=247}}\n\n===Signals intelligence===\nThe Italians had replaced their ciphers in the AOI in November 1940 but by the end of the month, the GC&CS in England and the Cipher Bureau Middle East (CBME) in Cairo had broken the new ''Regio Esercito'' and ''Regia Aeronautica'' ciphers. By 1941, sufficient low-grade ciphers had been broken to reveal the Italian order of battle and the supply situation, by the time that the British offensive began on 19 January 1941. Italian dependence on wireless communication, using frequencies on which it was easy for the British to eavesdrop, led to a flood of information, from the daily report from the Viceroy, to the operational plans of the ''Regia Aeronautica'' and ''Regia Esercito'' on the retreat from Keren.{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|pp=64\u201365}} On occasion, British commanders had messages before the recipients and it was reported later by the Deputy Director Military Intelligence in Cairo, that\n\n{{quote|...he could not believe that any army commander in the field had [ever] been better served by his intelligence....|DDMI (ME){{sfn|Hinsley|1994|pp=64\u201365}}}}\n\n===Casualties===\nOn 16 April 1941, the authorities in the AOI signalled to Rome that {{nowrap|426 officers}} had been killed, {{nowrap|703 wounded}} and {{nowrap|315 captured,}} during military operations before the surrender.

[[Amedeo Guillet]] was one of the Italian officers who fought with the Italian guerrillas in Ethiopia. Another notable guerrilla leader was [[Hamid Idris Awate]], a father of the [[Eritrean Liberation Front]]. Other Italian officers were Captain [[Francesco De Martini]] in Eritrea, Colonel Calderari in western Ethiopia/Somalia, Colonel Di Marco in Ogaden/British Somaliland \"blackshirt centurion\" De Varda in Somalia/Ethiopia and Major Lucchetti in Ethiopia. Civilians participated and in August 1942, forces led by Dr. [[Rosa Dainelli]] sabotaged the main British ammunition dump in Addis Ababa.{{sfn|Roselli|2007|p=58}} Hostilities in East Africa officially ceased on 9 September 1943, when the Italian government signed the [[Armistice with Italy]].

[[Makonnen Endelkachew]] was named as Prime Minister and on 19 December 1944, the final Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement was signed. Eritrea was placed under British military administration for the duration and in 1950, it became part of Ethiopia. After 1945, Britain controlled both Somalilands, as [[protectorate]]s.

He began his career by wrestling under his real name, as part of a [[tag team]] called [[The Fabulous Rougeaus]] with his brother [[Raymond Rougeau]]. In 1991, he began a singles career as '''The Mountie''', winning the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship]] once. In 1993, he formed [[The Quebecers]] with [[Carl Ouellet|Pierre Ouellet]], and won the [[WWF Tag Team Championship]] three times.\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\nThe [[Rougeau wrestling family|Rougeau family]] as a whole has been very involved in professional wrestling; Jacques is the younger brother of [[Raymond Rougeau]], the son of [[Jacques Rougeau, Sr.]], and the nephew of [[Jean Rougeau|Jean \"Johnny\" Rougeau]], all of whom have worked as professional wrestlers and promoters of wrestling matches. Jacques' sister Johanne also promoted wrestling matches in Montreal, and brother [[Armand Rougeau|Armand]] wrestled for smaller federations.\n\n=== Early career (1977\u20131985) ===\nJacques Rougeau began his career in 1977, working in [[Stu Hart]]'s [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]] based [[Stampede Wrestling]] [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]]. In the 1980s he began wrestling in the United States, achieving success in [[Alabama]] and [[Tennessee]], and in 1985 he and Ray were signed by the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]].<ref name=oww/>\n\n===World Wrestling Federation===\n\n====The Rougeau Brothers (1986\u20131990)====\n{{Main|The Fabulous Rougeaus}}\nJacques along with Raymond Rougeau made his WWF debut in February 1986 during a tour of Australia. They teamed together as ''The Fabulous Rougeaus''. During their first year with the company they faced and defeated such duos as [[The Hart Foundation]] ([[Bret Hart]] and [[Jim Neidhart]]), [[The Moondogs (professional wrestling)|The Moondogs]], Jimmy Jack and [[Dory Funk, Jr.]], and [[The Dream Team (professional wrestling)|The Dream Team]] ([[Greg Valentine]] and [[Brutus Beefcake]]).\n\nAlthough they lost their match at WrestleMania III in 1987 to Valentine and Beefcake, they briefly upset The Hart Foundation for the WWF Tag Team Championship at the [[Montreal Forum]] on August 10 that year. The decision was reversed to a disqualification and the championship returned, since the challengers initially won after using Jimmy Hart's megaphone as a weapon.<ref name=oww/>\n\nAfter two years in the Federation, The Fabulous Rougeaus turned [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] when they participated in an [[List of professional wrestling terms#A|angle]] in which the Canadian brothers were announced as \"From Canada, but soon to relocate to the United States\", and had an intentionally annoying entrance theme in which they sang (partly in French) about being \"All-American Boys\" as well as now having [[Jimmy Hart]] as their [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] (They were also briefly billed from [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], Jimmy Hart's home city). They waved tiny American flags, infuriating fans, who questioned their sincerity. They would humorously attempt to start \"USA!\" chants, which led to further negative fan \"heat\". According to Jacques, the widespread antipathy of American fans inspired [[Vince McMahon]] to turn them into heels. They feuded with [[The Killer Bees (professional wrestling)|The Killer Bees]], [[The Hart Foundation]] (who had turned face in between), [[The Bushwhackers]], and [[The Rockers]] during their heel run.\n\n====The Mountie (1991\u20131992)====\nRay Rougeau retired in early 1990, and Jacques departed the Federation for a year before returning as The Mountie in 1991, once again a client of manager Jimmy Hart. The Mountie was a corrupt, [[cattle prod]]-wielding member of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] who often boasted that he \"always gets his man\". The cattle prod came into play as part of The Mountie's post-match gimmick, where he would handcuff, berate and then \"shock\" his defeated and helpless opponents in the stomach. The storyline behind the image change was that Jacques Rougeau had actually gone through the training to become a Mountie to wield authority.  The character was eventually the subject of litigation in Canada, leading to Rougeau being enjoined from performing as The Mountie in his home country. Thus, while wrestling in Canada, he was billed using only his real name and did not wear his Mountie-inspired hat and jacket to the ring, although he did retain other parts of his costume such as red shirt, black pants, and boots.<ref name=oww/>\n\nThe Mountie made his in-ring debut in January 1991.

He began his career by wrestling under his real name, as part of a [[tag team]] called [[The Fabulous Rougeaus]] with his brother [[Raymond Rougeau]]. In 1991, he began a singles career as '''The Mountie''', winning the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship]] once. In 1993, he formed [[The Quebecers]] with [[Carl Ouellet|Pierre Ouellet]], and won the [[WWF Tag Team Championship]] three times.\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\nThe [[Rougeau wrestling family|Rougeau family]] as a whole has been very involved in professional wrestling; Jacques is the younger brother of [[Raymond Rougeau]], the son of [[Jacques Rougeau, Sr.]], and the nephew of [[Jean Rougeau|Jean \"Johnny\" Rougeau]], all of whom have worked as professional wrestlers and promoters of wrestling matches. Jacques' sister Johanne also promoted wrestling matches in Montreal, and brother [[Armand Rougeau|Armand]] wrestled for smaller federations.\n\n=== Early career (1977\u20131985) ===\nJacques Rougeau began his career in 1977, working in [[Stu Hart]]'s [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]] based [[Stampede Wrestling]] [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]]. In the 1980s he began wrestling in the United States, achieving success in [[Alabama]] and [[Tennessee]], and in 1985 he and Ray were signed by the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]].<ref name=oww/>\n\n===World Wrestling Federation===\n\n====The Rougeau Brothers (1986\u20131990)====\n{{Main|The Fabulous Rougeaus}}\nJacques along with Raymond Rougeau made his WWF debut in February 1986 during a tour of Australia. They teamed together as ''The Fabulous Rougeaus''. During their first year with the company they faced and defeated such duos as [[The Hart Foundation]] ([[Bret Hart]] and [[Jim Neidhart]]), [[The Moondogs (professional wrestling)|The Moondogs]], Jimmy Jack and [[Dory Funk, Jr.]], and [[The Dream Team (professional wrestling)|The Dream Team]] ([[Greg Valentine]] and [[Brutus Beefcake]]).\n\nAlthough they lost their match at WrestleMania III in 1987 to Valentine and Beefcake, they briefly upset The Hart Foundation for the WWF Tag Team Championship at the [[Montreal Forum]] on August 10 that year. The decision was reversed to a disqualification and the championship returned, since the challengers initially won after using Jimmy Hart's megaphone as a weapon.<ref name=oww/>\n\nAfter two years in the Federation, The Fabulous Rougeaus turned [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] when they participated in an [[List of professional wrestling terms#A|angle]] in which the Canadian brothers were announced as \"From Canada, but soon to relocate to the United States\", and had an intentionally annoying entrance theme in which they sang (partly in French) about being \"All-American Boys\" as well as now having [[Jimmy Hart]] as their [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] (They were also briefly billed from [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], Jimmy Hart's home city). They waved tiny American flags, infuriating fans, who questioned their sincerity. They would humorously attempt to start \"USA!\" chants, which led to further negative fan \"heat\". According to Jacques, the widespread antipathy of American fans inspired [[Vince McMahon]] to turn them into heels. They feuded with [[The Killer Bees (professional wrestling)|The Killer Bees]], [[The Hart Foundation]] (who had turned face in between), [[The Bushwhackers]], and [[The Rockers]] during their heel run.\n\n====The Mountie (1991\u20131992)====\nRay Rougeau retired in early 1990, and Jacques departed the Federation for a year before returning as The Mountie in 1991, once again a client of manager Jimmy Hart. The Mountie was a corrupt, [[cattle prod]]-wielding member of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] who often boasted that he \"always gets his man\". The cattle prod came into play as part of The Mountie's post-match gimmick, where he would handcuff, berate and then \"shock\" his defeated and helpless opponents in the stomach. The storyline behind the image change was that Jacques Rougeau had actually gone through the training to become a Mountie to wield authority.  The character was eventually the subject of litigation in Canada, leading to Rougeau being enjoined from performing as The Mountie in his home country. Thus, while wrestling in Canada, he was billed using only his real name and did not wear his Mountie-inspired hat and jacket to the ring, although he did retain other parts of his costume such as red shirt, black pants, and boots.<ref name=oww/>\n\nThe Mountie made his in-ring debut in January 1991.

In 1991, he was sentenced to 3 and a half years in jail due to involvement in a gang shooting, although this was reduced a year. In 1995, police intelligence reports indicated he had been fraternizing with gang members from [[Brent, London|Brent]] and [[Notting Hill]]. He also had a feud with Jerome Maddix, who had experienced a drive-by shooting at his home. He was murdered a year later in Jamaica.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn 1996, police believed Mark and an associate, Clifford Angol, may have been involved in the non-fatal shooting of Kenneth Wowe in West London. The following year, three gunmen entered a Caribbean restaurant in West London called The Place To Be and asked to see Mark. While it is suspected Mark Lambie was there at the time, he kept quiet if he was. Instead two innocent Marks were shot after identifying themselves.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Police suspected this may have been an attempted retaliation shooting following the shooting of Kenneth Wowe. Six months later, Kenneth Wowe was shot dead. Mark and Clifford were promptly arrested, but let go due to lack of evidence.

The victim named Mark Lambie as the shooter, who was then arrested, but once again was let go after the victim withdrew his evidence. In the same year, police believed he and an associate, Michael Thomas (aka Mallet), had shot at an EQ nightclub in Hackney Marsh. Police suspected this was a form of blackmail. There was a third incident at a Hackney club where Stephen Grant was shot dead. Police suspected this was a part of the TMD and Hackney Boys dispute. Lambie was suspected of being at the club.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== 2000\u20132002: Fall of Mark Lambie ===\nBy 2000, Mark Lambie was considered untouchable by the local black community.

Instead police used similar tactics American police used when going after [[Al Capone]], by going after his associates. Police also found that Mark was living in South London, rather than North as was expected, and that he was using false names, such as 'Paul Gordan'. Eventually they managed to find him and his brother, Wesley Lambie, in a car that was suspected to be stolen (although the owner refused to testify it was). They also found heroin in the car, but were unable to link it to the Lambie brothers. Although they were unable to bring charges, knowing where he was made surveillance now a possibility.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn 2002, Mark Lambie, along with Anthony \"Blue\" Bourne (member of the North London gang \"The Firm\"), were jailed after the kidnapping, blackmailing, and torture of two men, Mr. Smith and Mr. Morris, from Tottenham on April 21, 2001. The police had been following Lambie around Tottenham on the day, and saw him enter and leave Broadwater Estate. It was considered too risky to enter the Estate, so they waited outside until Mark left, and followed him to a party. Nothing eventful happened, so they returned to the police station.<ref name=\":3\" /> What they didn't know, is that an associate of Mark, Anthony Bourne, had lured two men into Broadwater Estate, where they were kidnapped at gunpoint by at least 14 people. The two men had driven a blue sports car into the estate, which the police had spotted earlier as they were following Mark. The group took the two men into a house, which they burst into and ordered the current occupants (two women and two children) to move downstairs, and then began to torture the two men, demanding money from them both. The house they had entered was the same house the police had seen Mark enter earlier in the day, which the police had interpreted to be a party.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"beeb1\" /><ref name=\"gruniad\" /><ref name=\":10\" />\n\nThey were hit with hammers, burned with an electric iron, and had boiling water poured onto their genitals. One of the victims, Mr. Smith, was able to escape after suggesting there was money at a nearby salon. He was bundled into a car, and driven to the salon, which was promptly robbed while the Mr. Smith was secured in the boot of the car. While the suspects were inside the salon, Mr. Smith was able to escape from the car and ran to the nearby police station. After his escape, the gang began to flee.

In 1991, he was sentenced to 3 and a half years in jail due to involvement in a gang shooting, although this was reduced a year. In 1995, police intelligence reports indicated he had been fraternizing with gang members from [[Brent, London|Brent]] and [[Notting Hill]]. He also had a feud with Jerome Maddix, who had experienced a drive-by shooting at his home. He was murdered a year later in Jamaica.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn 1996, police believed Mark and an associate, Clifford Angol, may have been involved in the non-fatal shooting of Kenneth Wowe in West London. The following year, three gunmen entered a Caribbean restaurant in West London called The Place To Be and asked to see Mark. While it is suspected Mark Lambie was there at the time, he kept quiet if he was. Instead two innocent Marks were shot after identifying themselves.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Police suspected this may have been an attempted retaliation shooting following the shooting of Kenneth Wowe. Six months later, Kenneth Wowe was shot dead. Mark and Clifford were promptly arrested, but let go due to lack of evidence.

The victim named Mark Lambie as the shooter, who was then arrested, but once again was let go after the victim withdrew his evidence. In the same year, police believed he and an associate, Michael Thomas (aka Mallet), had shot at an EQ nightclub in Hackney Marsh. Police suspected this was a form of blackmail. There was a third incident at a Hackney club where Stephen Grant was shot dead. Police suspected this was a part of the TMD and Hackney Boys dispute. Lambie was suspected of being at the club.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== 2000\u20132002: Fall of Mark Lambie ===\nBy 2000, Mark Lambie was considered untouchable by the local black community.

Instead police used similar tactics American police used when going after [[Al Capone]], by going after his associates. Police also found that Mark was living in South London, rather than North as was expected, and that he was using false names, such as 'Paul Gordan'. Eventually they managed to find him and his brother, Wesley Lambie, in a car that was suspected to be stolen (although the owner refused to testify it was). They also found heroin in the car, but were unable to link it to the Lambie brothers. Although they were unable to bring charges, knowing where he was made surveillance now a possibility.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn 2002, Mark Lambie, along with Anthony \"Blue\" Bourne (member of the North London gang \"The Firm\"), were jailed after the kidnapping, blackmailing, and torture of two men, Mr. Smith and Mr. Morris, from Tottenham on April 21, 2001. The police had been following Lambie around Tottenham on the day, and saw him enter and leave Broadwater Estate. It was considered too risky to enter the Estate, so they waited outside until Mark left, and followed him to a party. Nothing eventful happened, so they returned to the police station.<ref name=\":3\" /> What they didn't know, is that an associate of Mark, Anthony Bourne, had lured two men into Broadwater Estate, where they were kidnapped at gunpoint by at least 14 people. The two men had driven a blue sports car into the estate, which the police had spotted earlier as they were following Mark. The group took the two men into a house, which they burst into and ordered the current occupants (two women and two children) to move downstairs, and then began to torture the two men, demanding money from them both. The house they had entered was the same house the police had seen Mark enter earlier in the day, which the police had interpreted to be a party.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"beeb1\" /><ref name=\"gruniad\" /><ref name=\":10\" />\n\nThey were hit with hammers, burned with an electric iron, and had boiling water poured onto their genitals. One of the victims, Mr. Smith, was able to escape after suggesting there was money at a nearby salon. He was bundled into a car, and driven to the salon, which was promptly robbed while the Mr. Smith was secured in the boot of the car. While the suspects were inside the salon, Mr. Smith was able to escape from the car and ran to the nearby police station. After his escape, the gang began to flee. They took Mr. Morris outside but were seen by a passing police car. The gang fled, and Mr. Morris ran towards a police car he had spotted passing by and lunged onto the bonnet asking for help.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/1978157.stm|title='Malign and corrosive' gangsters|date=2002-05-17|access-date=2019-08-07|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807132737/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/1978157.stm|archive-date=7 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"beeb1\" /><ref name=\"gruniad\" /><ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MikCDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT390&lpg=PT390&dq=%22mark-lambie%22+%22man-dem%22&source=bl&ots=BVEUhdd_0N&sig=ACfU3U2vt1D__Lbpx4HQEVJll27-eczRwQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjM2v6wjfDjAhUTonEKHc_aD_cQ6AEwHHoECDcQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22mark-lambie%22%20%22man-dem%22&f=false|title=Blood on the Page: WINNER of the 2018 Gold Dagger Award for Non-Fiction|last=Harding|first=Thomas|date=2018-01-25|publisher=Random House|isbn=9781473537958|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nTwo other members of the gang that were involved in the incident, Warren Leader and Francis Osei, were also convicted of kidnapping and blackmail.<ref name=\"beeb1\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Warren Leader was released in 2009, but in 2013 he was jailed for 16 years for running a heroin factory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/yardie-gangster-who-ran-heroin-factory-jailed-for-16-years-8746168.html|title=Yardie gangster who ran heroin factory jailed for 16 years|date=2013-08-05|website=Evening Standard|language=en|access-date=2019-08-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807132755/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/yardie-gangster-who-ran-heroin-factory-jailed-for-16-years-8746168.html|archive-date=7 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2003, Gavin Smith was killed in [[Lordship Recreation Ground]].

However, his private medical practice, with limited staff and resources, can only treat ten patients at a time. From a group of fifty patients he has selected ten he believes he can cure and who, he believes, are most worthy of being saved. However, when he is approached by a young woman, Jennifer Dubedat, with a deadly ill husband, Louis Dubedat, he admits he can, at a stretch, save one more patient, but that the individual in question must be shown to be most worthy of being saved. However, the situation is complicated when an old friend and colleague reveals, he too, needs treatment. Sir Colenso must choose which patient he will save: a kindly, altruistic poor medical colleague, or an extremely gifted but also very unpleasant, womaniser, bigamist and amoral young artist. Sir Colenso falls instantly in love with the young and vivacious Mrs Dubedat and this makes it even harder for the doctor to separate his motives for the decision of who shall live.\n\n==Preface==\nThe preface to the play \u2013\u00a0typically, as long as the drama itself \u2013 is an extensive tirade against the professions, and in particular the medical profession.  As a founding member of the [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] movement in 1884, Shaw \u2013 a school drop-out who had used the British Library to achieve a massive self-education programme in his 20s and was active in local politics in the deprived London area of St Pancras \u2013 was a passionate critic of the huge disparities between the wealthy and the poor, and his unique combination of prodigious intellect and panoramic knowledge meant that he was seldom intimidated in his mission for fairness and truth.  At the time of this play he was a highly successful dramatist, with plays such as ''[[Man and Superman]]'' and ''[[Major Barbara]]'' enjoying international acclaim. ''The Doctor's Dilemma'' would come to be seen as the greatest satire on the medical profession since [[Moli\u00e8re]]'s ''[[Malade Imaginaire]]''<ref>Iain McClure, British Medical Journal, 4 August 2007, \"The Doctor's Dilemma\".</ref>.\n\nShaw credits [[Almroth Wright]] as the source of his information on medical science: \"It will be evident to all experts that my play could not have been written but for the work done by Sir Alm[r]oth Wright on the theory and practice of securing immunization from bacterial diseases by the inoculation of vaccines made of their own bacteria.\"<ref>Violet M. Broad & C. Lewis Broad, ''Dictionary to the Plays and Novels of Bernard Shaw'', A. & C. Black, London, 1929, p.41.</ref>  This remark is characteristically ironical.  Wright was knighted shortly before this play was written, and Shaw was suspicious of Wright's high reputation (the latter was also known by the nickname Sir Almost Right). The two men met in 1905, and engaged in a long series of robust discussions, involving at one point a challenge from the medical audience that they had \"too many patients on our hands already\". Shaw's response was to ask what would be done if there was more demand from patients than could be satisfied, and Wright answered: \"We should have to consider which life was worth saving.\" This became the \"dilemma\" of the play<ref>Michael Holroyd, ''The Guardian'' 13 July 2012, \"Bernard Shaw and his lethally absurd doctor's dilemma\".</ref>.\n\nThe preface mentions that there is another dilemma: poor doctors are easily tempted to perform costly but useless (and in the best case harmless) operations or treatments on their patients for personal gain. \"Could I not make a better use of a pocketful of guineas than this man is making of his leg?\" This was reportedly inspired by the behaviour of a prominent Ear Nose and Throat specialist in London who had developed a simple and almost harmless operation to remove the [[uvula]], which did no benefit to his patients but made the surgeon a great deal of money.\n\n==Significance==\nThe play also mentions (then) new developments in the [[germ theory of disease]], namely [[opsonin]]s, and included [[socialist]] and anti-[[vivisection]]ist viewpoints. \n\nThe theme of the play remains current: in any time, there will be treatments that are so scarce or costly that some people can have them while others cannot. Who is to decide, and on which grounds is the decision to be taken?\n\nIt is sometimes claimed that an unexpected side-effect of the play's success was to greatly increase the popularity of the first name \"[[Jennifer (given name)|Jennifer]]\" (the name of the main female protagonist) in the English-speaking world.  However, UK government statistics (covering England and Wales) only show the name 'Jennifer' first entering the top 100 most commonly used names for baby girls in 1934\u2014a full 28 years after the play was first staged.  Similarly, the name didn't enter the top ''1,000'' names for newborn US girls until 1938.\n\n==Production information==\n''The Doctor's Dilemma'' was first produced on 20 November 1906 at the [[Royal Court Theatre]].<ref>[http://www.irishplayography.com/search/play.asp?play_id=2227 Irish Playography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502064748/http://www.irishplayography.com/search/play.asp?play_ID=2227 |date=2007-05-02 }}</ref>\n\nActress [[Katharine Cornell]] produced the play in 1941, starring herself and [[Raymond Massey]].<ref>Tad Mosel, \"Leading Lady:  The World and Theatre of Katharine Cornell,\" Little, Brown & Co., Boston (1978)</ref>\n\nA [[The Doctor's Dilemma (film)|film adaptation]] of the play, with the same title, was made in 1958, directed by [[Anthony Asquith]], starring [[Leslie Caron]] and [[Dirk Bogarde]].<ref>[http://www.britmovie.co.uk/films/The-Doctors-Dilemma/listType/alpha ''The Doctors's Dilemma'' - 1958 film] - at ''Britmovie.co.uk''</ref>\n\nThe play\u2019s most recent high-profile revival was on the Lyttelton stage at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] in London.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/the-doctors-dilemma |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103232330/http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/the-doctors-dilemma |archivedate=2013-11-03 }}</ref> The production was directed by Nadia Fall, with [[Aden Gillett]] playing the eponymous doctor, [[Genevieve O'Reilly]] as Jennifer Dubedat, and [[Tom Burke (actor)|Tom Burke]] as Louis Dubedat.
