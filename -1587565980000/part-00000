When he was a few years old, his family moved to the western mountain city of [[Gharyan]], where they resided for sometime before returning to Souq Al-Jumuah in Tripoli.\n\n== Education ==\nHe began his education in Gharyan. When he was in second grade, he moved to Souq Al-Jumuah schools where he continued his studies until he completed high school.  He then studied at the [[University of Tripoli]] where he earned a B.Sc. in electrical engineering. In 1975, Abushagur moved to [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[California]] to continue his education at the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech). During his time at Caltech, he earned a M.Sc. in electrical engineering in 1977 and earned his Ph.D. in 1984.\n\n== Career ==\nAbushagur began his academic career as a visiting professor at the [[University of Rochester]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1984. Then he joined the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] (UAH) in 1985 as an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering (ECE) and became full Professor in 1995. While working in the ECE department, he proposed a plan to start an optical engineering undergraduate program. He went on to develop the curriculum and was the Chairman of the Optical Engineering Committee for the remainder of his time at the university. This program became the first to receive the ABET accreditation in optical engineering in the USA. During his time at UAH, Abushagur received multiple research awards and grants from several federal agencies, such as [[NASA]], [[National Science Foundation|NSF]], [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] and the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]. While on sabbatical leave from UAH, Abushagur was involved in two start-up companies. The first start-up was Photronix (M) Sdn.

While at Caltech, Abushagur was actively working with other regime opposition members in the United States. Abushagur had met many Gaddafi dissidents while at the [[University of Tripoli]], such as [[Abdurrahim El-Keib]] in 1971.<ref>{{cite news|title=Professor Elected as Prime Minister|url=http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/oct/31/professor-elected-as-prime-minister-of-libya/|newspaper=The Washington Times|accessdate=7 November 2011}}</ref> El-Keib later went on to become the second interim Prime Minister of [[Libya]] during the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]]. His contact with El-Keib, as well as many other dissidents, continued after his move to California, where many of them attended universities. This common goal of overthrowing the Gaddafi regime solidified their resolve as they all actively worked to end Gaddafi's rule of Libya for the next three decades. In 1980, Abushagur made his final visit to Libya to say farewell to his family before his Gaddafi opposition group started to openly oppose the regime. Abushagur became involved in the creation and leadership of several opposition groups, including the [[National Front for the Salvation of Libya]] (he later left the National Front in 1992). As a result of these political activities, he was placed on Gaddafi's wanted list in early 1981. Abushagur and his fellow dissidents lived in exile outside of Libya for the next thirty-two years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.alaan.tv/show-video/studio-alaan/Abu-shakor-Cape-ancient-families-Tripoli-contributed-opposition-Gaddafi/|title=\u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646; \u0633\u062a\u062f\u064a\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646 ; \u062f. \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0634\u0627\u0642\u0648\u0631: \u0627\u0644\u0643\u064a\u0628 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0637\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0644\u0633 \u0648\u0633\u0627\u0647\u0645 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0631\u0636\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0630\u0627\u0641\u064a|publisher=Alaan TV|date=2 November 2011|accessdate=8 October 2012}}</ref> In May 1984, the National Front for the Salvation of Libya attempted to overthrow the Libyan regime.

During the televised interrogations, Abushagur's name was mentioned several times. These confessions caused Abushagur's family in Libya to face significant hardships for many years to follow.\n\nAt the beginning of the 17 February Revolution, the [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) began appointing representatives from the districts and cities of western Libya in an effort to create a unified front for the entire country against Gaddafi. Due to the military crackdown in the west by Gaddafi, many of the representatives that were chosen by the NTC lived abroad in order to safeguard the identities of anti-Gaddafi figures living in [[Tripolitania|western Libya]]. Abushagur joined the delegation representing the west, central and south of Libya to Benghazi to show their support for the NTC. For the formal announcement of the NTC representatives in May 2011, Abushagur flew to Benghazi and set foot on Libyan soil for the first time in nearly thirty-two years. For the remainder of the revolution, Abushagur continued to work behind the scenes as advisor with the NTC and was a regular guest on Al-Aan TV and Al-Arabiyah TV as a Libyan affairs analyst.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://akhbar.alaan.tv/video/alaan-reports/mustafa-abu-shaqoor-6LdM/|title=\u0627\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646  \u062a\u0642\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646; \u0645\u0635\u0637\u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0634\u0627\u0642\u0648\u0631 - \u0646\u0627\u0634\u0637 \u0633\u064a\u0627\u0633\u064a \u0644\u064a\u0628\u064a|publisher=Alaan TV|date=20 October 2011|accessdate=8 October 2012|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709050618/http://akhbar.alaan.tv/video/alaan-reports/mustafa-abu-shaqoor-6LdM/|archive-date=9 July 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://akhbar.alaan.tv/video/alaan-reports/mustafa-abu-shaqoor-VHOa/|title=\u0627\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646 ; \u062a\u0642\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646 ; \u0645\u0635\u0637\u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0634\u0627\u0642\u0648\u0631  \u0646\u0627\u0634\u0637 \u0633\u064a\u0627\u0633\u064a \u0644\u064a\u0628\u064a|publisher=Alaan TV|date=20 October 2011|accessdate=8 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425120014/http://akhbar.alaan.tv/video/alaan-reports/mustafa-abu-shaqoor-VHOa/|archive-date=25 April 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://akhbar.alaan.tv/video/alaan-reports/mustafa-abu-shaqoor-m8g6/|title=\u0627\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646 ; \u062a\u0642\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646 ; \u0645\u0635\u0637\u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0634\u0627\u0642\u0648\u0631 \u0646\u0627\u0634\u0637 \u0633\u064a\u0627\u0633\u064a \u0644\u064a\u0628\u064a|publisher=Alaan TV|date=20 October 2011|accessdate=8 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425120019/http://akhbar.alaan.tv/video/alaan-reports/mustafa-abu-shaqoor-m8g6/|archive-date=25 April 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn 22 November 2011, Abushagur was named the Deputy Prime Minister of Libya.

He was widely expected to be elected President of the House when it first met on 4 August 2014.<ref name=\"Kidnapped\">{{cite news |last=Abdul-Wahab |first=Ashraf  |date=29 July 2014 |title=Abushagur reported kidnapped |url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2014/07/29/abushagur-reported-kidnapped/#axzz395RDIHsn |newspaper=Libya Herald |location=Tripoli |publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n===Kidnapping===\nOn the early afternoon of 29 July 2014, Abushagur was kidnapped from his home in Hay al-Andalus by an armed group, who were travelling in several vehicles, including an unmarked ambulance. The group reportedly forced him at gunpoint into the unmarked ambulance, in front of his wife, daughters and another relative. As Abushagur was being driven away with a gun pointed at his head, a relative who was present at his home attempted to follow them in his personal vehicle; however, two other vehicles that were involved in his abduction moved in and blocked the road, preventing him from pursuing.<ref name=\"Kidnapped\"/>\n\nAbushagur was released at approximately 3:00{{nbsp}}am on 30 July. Abushagur was released unharmed, with no ransom being paid.<ref name=\"Released\">{{cite news |last=Fornaji |first=Hadi |date=30 July 2014 |title=Abushagur freed |url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2014/07/30/abushagur-freed/#axzz395RDIHsn |newspaper=Libya Herald |location=Tripoli |publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nThe following day, Abushagur held a press conference at the [[Rixos Hotels|Rixos Conference Hotel]] where he accused the Zintani militia group as Barq Al-Nasr (Victory Lightening) as being behind his 9-hour kidnapping. Abushagur claimed that the ambulance he had been forced into took him to a barracks in the Swani area of Tripoli. He stated that his captors repeatedly asked him to reveal unspecified information. He claimed that he was also accused of being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood; an accusation which he denied. After being asked by his captors whether he supported General Haftar's Operation Dignity, Abushagur replied that he did not support any operations outside the state. He also claimed that his captors accused him of being wealthy and demanded 20 million Libyan dinars. After several hours of interrogation by his captors, he was escorted to a jail cell and remained there for several hours. Some time later, he was removed from the jail cell and a few hours later he was released.<ref name=\"Statement\">{{cite news |last=Zaptia |first=Sami |date=1 August 2014 |title=Zintani militias kidnapped me \u2013 Abushagur |url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2014/08/02/zintani-militias-kidnapped-me-abushagur/#axzz395RDIHsn |newspaper=Libya Herald |location=Tripoli |publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nAt the conference Abushagur stressed that his kidnappers did not physically harm him, and also stressed that he believed the militia was not acting on behalf of the city of Zintan, but were instead acting on their own initiative. Abushagur claimed that he was freed after another Zintani suddenly released him, and stated that he was still unsure of the reasons for his abduction. At the end of his statement Abushagur refused to take any questions.<ref name=\"Statement\"/>\n\nIn late August 2017, Abushagur resigned from the Libyan House of Representatives (HoR), accusing it of blocking the implementation of the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.libyaherald.com/2017/08/28/abushagur-resigns-from-house-of-representatives/|title=Abushagur resigns from House of Representatives|publisher=Libya Herald|date=28 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://blog.al.com/breaking/2011/11/former_longtime_uah_professor.html Former Longtime UAH Professor named Deputy Prime Minister of Libya]\n* [https://www.rit.edu/showcase/index.php?id=225 Mustafa Abushagur: Influencing a Changing World]\n* [https://www.rit.edu/news/mustafa-abushagur-talks-about-his-countrys-future Mustafa Abushagur Talks About His Country's Future]\n\n{{National Transitional Council}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Abushagur, Mustafa}}\n[[Category:1951 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:California Institute of Technology alumni]]\n[[Category:Government ministers of Libya]]\n[[Category:National Front for the Salvation of Libya politicians]]\n[[Category:Members of the Interim Government of Libya]]\n[[Category:Members of the National Transitional Council]]\n[[Category:People of the Libyan Civil War (2011)]]\n[[Category:Politicians from Huntsville, Alabama]]\n[[Category:University of Tripoli alumni]]\n[[Category:Libyan emigrants to the United States]]\n[[Category:Fellows of SPIE]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2013}}\n{{Infobox officeholder\n|name           = Mustafa A.G.

When he was a few years old, his family moved to the western mountain city of [[Gharyan]], where they resided for sometime before returning to Souq Al-Jumuah in Tripoli.\n\n== Education ==\nHe began his education in Gharyan. When he was in second grade, he moved to Souq Al-Jumuah schools where he continued his studies until he completed high school.  He then studied at the [[University of Tripoli]] where he earned a B.Sc. in electrical engineering. In 1975, Abushagur moved to [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[California]] to continue his education at the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech). During his time at Caltech, he earned a M.Sc. in electrical engineering in 1977 and earned his Ph.D. in 1984.\n\n== Career ==\nAbushagur began his academic career as a visiting professor at the [[University of Rochester]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1984. Then he joined the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] (UAH) in 1985 as an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering (ECE) and became full Professor in 1995. While working in the ECE department, he proposed a plan to start an optical engineering undergraduate program. He went on to develop the curriculum and was the Chairman of the Optical Engineering Committee for the remainder of his time at the university. This program became the first to receive the ABET accreditation in optical engineering in the USA. During his time at UAH, Abushagur received multiple research awards and grants from several federal agencies, such as [[NASA]], [[National Science Foundation|NSF]], [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] and the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]. While on sabbatical leave from UAH, Abushagur was involved in two start-up companies. The first start-up was Photronix (M) Sdn.

While at Caltech, Abushagur was actively working with other regime opposition members in the United States. Abushagur had met many Gaddafi dissidents while at the [[University of Tripoli]], such as [[Abdurrahim El-Keib]] in 1971.<ref>{{cite news|title=Professor Elected as Prime Minister|url=http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/oct/31/professor-elected-as-prime-minister-of-libya/|newspaper=The Washington Times|accessdate=7 November 2011}}</ref> El-Keib later went on to become the second interim Prime Minister of [[Libya]] during the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]]. His contact with El-Keib, as well as many other dissidents, continued after his move to California, where many of them attended universities. This common goal of overthrowing the Gaddafi regime solidified their resolve as they all actively worked to end Gaddafi's rule of Libya for the next three decades. In 1980, Abushagur made his final visit to Libya to say farewell to his family before his Gaddafi opposition group started to openly oppose the regime. Abushagur became involved in the creation and leadership of several opposition groups, including the [[National Front for the Salvation of Libya]] (he later left the National Front in 1992). As a result of these political activities, he was placed on Gaddafi's wanted list in early 1981. Abushagur and his fellow dissidents lived in exile outside of Libya for the next thirty-two years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.alaan.tv/show-video/studio-alaan/Abu-shakor-Cape-ancient-families-Tripoli-contributed-opposition-Gaddafi/|title=\u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646; \u0633\u062a\u062f\u064a\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646 ; \u062f. \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0634\u0627\u0642\u0648\u0631: \u0627\u0644\u0643\u064a\u0628 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0637\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0644\u0633 \u0648\u0633\u0627\u0647\u0645 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0631\u0636\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0630\u0627\u0641\u064a|publisher=Alaan TV|date=2 November 2011|accessdate=8 October 2012}}</ref> In May 1984, the National Front for the Salvation of Libya attempted to overthrow the Libyan regime.

During the televised interrogations, Abushagur's name was mentioned several times. These confessions caused Abushagur's family in Libya to face significant hardships for many years to follow.\n\nAt the beginning of the 17 February Revolution, the [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) began appointing representatives from the districts and cities of western Libya in an effort to create a unified front for the entire country against Gaddafi. Due to the military crackdown in the west by Gaddafi, many of the representatives that were chosen by the NTC lived abroad in order to safeguard the identities of anti-Gaddafi figures living in [[Tripolitania|western Libya]]. Abushagur joined the delegation representing the west, central and south of Libya to Benghazi to show their support for the NTC. For the formal announcement of the NTC representatives in May 2011, Abushagur flew to Benghazi and set foot on Libyan soil for the first time in nearly thirty-two years. For the remainder of the revolution, Abushagur continued to work behind the scenes as advisor with the NTC and was a regular guest on Al-Aan TV and Al-Arabiyah TV as a Libyan affairs analyst.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://akhbar.alaan.tv/video/alaan-reports/mustafa-abu-shaqoor-6LdM/|title=\u0627\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646  \u062a\u0642\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646; \u0645\u0635\u0637\u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0634\u0627\u0642\u0648\u0631 - \u0646\u0627\u0634\u0637 \u0633\u064a\u0627\u0633\u064a \u0644\u064a\u0628\u064a|publisher=Alaan TV|date=20 October 2011|accessdate=8 October 2012|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709050618/http://akhbar.alaan.tv/video/alaan-reports/mustafa-abu-shaqoor-6LdM/|archive-date=9 July 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://akhbar.alaan.tv/video/alaan-reports/mustafa-abu-shaqoor-VHOa/|title=\u0627\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646 ; \u062a\u0642\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646 ; \u0645\u0635\u0637\u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0634\u0627\u0642\u0648\u0631  \u0646\u0627\u0634\u0637 \u0633\u064a\u0627\u0633\u064a \u0644\u064a\u0628\u064a|publisher=Alaan TV|date=20 October 2011|accessdate=8 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425120014/http://akhbar.alaan.tv/video/alaan-reports/mustafa-abu-shaqoor-VHOa/|archive-date=25 April 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://akhbar.alaan.tv/video/alaan-reports/mustafa-abu-shaqoor-m8g6/|title=\u0627\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646 ; \u062a\u0642\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646 ; \u0645\u0635\u0637\u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0634\u0627\u0642\u0648\u0631 \u0646\u0627\u0634\u0637 \u0633\u064a\u0627\u0633\u064a \u0644\u064a\u0628\u064a|publisher=Alaan TV|date=20 October 2011|accessdate=8 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425120019/http://akhbar.alaan.tv/video/alaan-reports/mustafa-abu-shaqoor-m8g6/|archive-date=25 April 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn 22 November 2011, Abushagur was named the Deputy Prime Minister of Libya. Two days after being named Deputy Prime Minister, he took his oath of allegiance, which stated: \"I swear by Almighty God to perform my duties honestly and faithfully, to stay faithful to the objectives of the Seventeenth of February Revolution, to respect the constitutional declaration and bylaws of the Council, to carefully honor the interests of the Libyan people and to safeguard the independence of Libya, its security and its territorial integrity.\" <ref>{{cite web|title=Interim Prime Minister and his Cabinet are Sworn into Office|url=http://eolibya.org/news/item/274-transitional-government.html|publisher=eolibya|accessdate=24 November 2011|archive-url=https://archive.today/20111229231341/http://eolibya.org/news/item/274-transitional-government.html|archive-date=29 December 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn 12 September 2012, Abushagur became the first elected [[Prime Minister]]-designate<ref name=\"AbdulWahab-Cousins\"/> in the modern history of [[Libya]]. He was elected by a vote of the [[General National Congress]] of Libya from eight nominees. He received 96 votes in the final round of voting, against rival [[Mahmoud Jibril]]'s 94 votes.<ref name=\"AbdulWahab-Cousins\"/>\n\nWhile Abushagur was widely referred to as Libya's prime minister, he was never actually sworn in as he was not able to win approval from the GNC for his cabinet proposals. On the submission of his second cabinet proposal, he made an impassioned speech calling on Congress members to reject alleged partisanship and unite in support of his government. Despite this, Congress voted by a large majority to dismiss him, and he was removed from office on 7 October 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/10/2012107115527139773.html|title=Libyan parliament votes to dismiss PM|agency=Al Jazeera}}</ref>\n\nAfter losing the job of Prime Minister-designate, Abushagur continued to serve as Deputy Prime Minister until [[Ali Zeidan]] was elected by the GNC to form a government. Zeidan's cabinet won approval from Congress and he was sworn in on 14 November, relieving Abushagur of his role.\n\n===2014 Election===\nAbushagur was elected to the Libyan House of Representatives in the [[2014 Libyan House of Representatives election|July 2014 election]]. He was elected for the Suq al-Juma district of Tripoli, as one of its 5 representatives. Abushagur won 14,305 votes, which was the largest number of votes won by any candidate on the general list in the entire country. He was widely expected to be elected President of the House when it first met on 4 August 2014.<ref name=\"Kidnapped\">{{cite news |last=Abdul-Wahab |first=Ashraf  |date=29 July 2014 |title=Abushagur reported kidnapped |url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2014/07/29/abushagur-reported-kidnapped/#axzz395RDIHsn |newspaper=Libya Herald |location=Tripoli |publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n===Kidnapping===\nOn the early afternoon of 29 July 2014, Abushagur was kidnapped from his home in Hay al-Andalus by an armed group, who were travelling in several vehicles, including an unmarked ambulance. The group reportedly forced him at gunpoint into the unmarked ambulance, in front of his wife, daughters and another relative. As Abushagur was being driven away with a gun pointed at his head, a relative who was present at his home attempted to follow them in his personal vehicle; however, two other vehicles that were involved in his abduction moved in and blocked the road, preventing him from pursuing.<ref name=\"Kidnapped\"/>\n\nAbushagur was released at approximately 3:00{{nbsp}}am on 30 July. Abushagur was released unharmed, with no ransom being paid.<ref name=\"Released\">{{cite news |last=Fornaji |first=Hadi |date=30 July 2014 |title=Abushagur freed |url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2014/07/30/abushagur-freed/#axzz395RDIHsn |newspaper=Libya Herald |location=Tripoli |publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nThe following day, Abushagur held a press conference at the [[Rixos Hotels|Rixos Conference Hotel]] where he accused the Zintani militia group as Barq Al-Nasr (Victory Lightening) as being behind his 9-hour kidnapping. Abushagur claimed that the ambulance he had been forced into took him to a barracks in the Swani area of Tripoli. He stated that his captors repeatedly asked him to reveal unspecified information. He claimed that he was also accused of being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood; an accusation which he denied. After being asked by his captors whether he supported General Haftar's Operation Dignity, Abushagur replied that he did not support any operations outside the state. He also claimed that his captors accused him of being wealthy and demanded 20 million Libyan dinars. After several hours of interrogation by his captors, he was escorted to a jail cell and remained there for several hours. Some time later, he was removed from the jail cell and a few hours later he was released.<ref name=\"Statement\">{{cite news |last=Zaptia |first=Sami |date=1 August 2014 |title=Zintani militias kidnapped me \u2013 Abushagur |url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2014/08/02/zintani-militias-kidnapped-me-abushagur/#axzz395RDIHsn |newspaper=Libya Herald |location=Tripoli |publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nAt the conference Abushagur stressed that his kidnappers did not physically harm him, and also stressed that he believed the militia was not acting on behalf of the city of Zintan, but were instead acting on their own initiative. Abushagur claimed that he was freed after another Zintani suddenly released him, and stated that he was still unsure of the reasons for his abduction. At the end of his statement Abushagur refused to take any questions.<ref name=\"Statement\"/>\n\nIn late August 2017, Abushagur resigned from the Libyan House of Representatives (HoR), accusing it of blocking the implementation of the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.libyaherald.com/2017/08/28/abushagur-resigns-from-house-of-representatives/|title=Abushagur resigns from House of Representatives|publisher=Libya Herald|date=28 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://blog.al.com/breaking/2011/11/former_longtime_uah_professor.html Former Longtime UAH Professor named Deputy Prime Minister of Libya]\n\n{{National Transitional Council}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Abushagur, Mustafa}}\n[[Category:1951 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:California Institute of Technology alumni]]\n[[Category:Government ministers of Libya]]\n[[Category:National Front for the Salvation of Libya politicians]]\n[[Category:Members of the Interim Government of Libya]]\n[[Category:Members of the National Transitional Council]]\n[[Category:People of the Libyan Civil War (2011)]]\n[[Category:Politicians from Huntsville, Alabama]]\n[[Category:University of Tripoli alumni]]\n[[Category:Libyan emigrants to the United States]]\n[[Category:Fellows of SPIE]]\n", "name_user": "Soumiea", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add two new pages that are first-person interviews", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_A.G._Abushagur"}
