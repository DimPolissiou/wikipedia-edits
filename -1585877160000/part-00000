While dwarves is an alternative spelling for dwarfs, for consistency please use dwarfs in this article.--> dwarfs with age above 100 years old that appear in the fairy tale ''[[Snow White]]'' and others.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)#Plot}}\nThe Seven Dwarfs are a group of seven [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarfs]] that live in a tiny cottage and work in the nearby mines. Snow White happens upon their house after being told by the [[Huntsman (Snow White)|Huntsman]] to flee from the [[Queen (Snow White)|Queen]]'s kingdom.\n\nThe Seven Dwarfs return home and immediately notice someone has sneaked in, because the house has been cleaned. During their loud discussion, they discover the sleeping Snow White. She wakes up and explains to them what happened. The Dwarfs take pity on her, saying: \"If you will keep house for us, and cook, make beds, wash, sew, and knit, and keep everything clean and orderly, then you can stay with us, and you shall have everything that you want.\" They warn her to be careful when alone at home, and to not let anyone in while they are [[wikt:delve#English|delving]] in the mountains.\n\nWhen the Queen disguised as an old [[peddler]] ties a colorful, silky [[bodice]] onto Snow White which causes her to faint, the Seven Dwarfs return just in time and Snow White revives when the Dwarfs loosen the lace. When the Queen dresses as a [[comb]] seller and gives Snow White a poisoned comb, the Seven Dwarfs save her again. The Queen then appears disguised as a [[farmer]]'s wife and gives Snow White a poisoned apple, of which she takes a bite. This time, the Seven Dwarfs are unable to revive the girl, because they can't find the source of Snow White's poor health and, assuming that she is dead, they place her in a glass [[coffin]]. After some time has passed, a Prince traveling through the land sees Snow White where he strides to her coffin, and instantly falls in love with her upon being enchanted by her beauty. The Prince kisses her which revives her.\n\n==Names==\nThe following is a list of names of the Seven Dwarfs from multiple versions of the [[Snow White]] story.

He is accident-prone and mute, with Happy explaining that he has simply \"never tried\" to speak. He is unvoiced like [[The Fox and the Cat#In Disney media|Gideon the Cat]] in ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', the title character as the circus elephant [[Dumbo]], and [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)#Disney's Peter Pan films|Tootles]] in ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]''.\n* '''Bashful''' (voiced by [[Scotty Mattraw]] in the film, [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 Bashful is very [[Shyness|shy]] and kind-hearted. He is also described as cute. He also has a rosy blushy face and a small shy smile.\n* '''Grumpy''' (voiced by [[Pinto Colvig]] in the film, [[Corey Burton]]) \u2013 Grumpy initially opposes [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]]'s presence in the dwarfs' home, but later warns her of the threat posed by the Queen and eagerly rushes to her aid upon realizing that she is in danger, leading the charge himself. He has the biggest nose of the dwarfs, and is frequently seen with one eye shut.\n* '''Sneezy''' (voiced by [[Billy Gilbert]] in the film, [[Bob Joles]]) \u2013 Sneezy's name is earned by his extraordinarily powerful sneezes (caused by [[hay fever]]), which are seen blowing even the heaviest of objects across a room.\n* '''Sleepy''' (voiced by [[Pinto Colvig]] in the film, [[Bill Farmer]]) \u2013 Sleepy is always tired and appears [[Lethargy|lethargic]] in most situations.\n* '''Happy''' (voiced by [[Otis Harlan]] in the film, [[Stephen Stanton]]) \u2013 Happy is the jovial dwarf and is usually portrayed laughing.\n\nThe Seven Dwarfs also appeared in ''[[Disney's House of Mouse|House of Mouse]]''.\n[[File:B-29 Doc McConnell Air Force Base July 17, 2016.jpg|thumb|Built during World War II, ''[[Doc (aircraft)|Doc]]'', a [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]], was named after one of the Seven Disney Dwarfs.]]\nIn the early 2000s, [[DisneyToon Studios]] (DTS) joined [[Disney Consumer Products]] (DCP) as their internal Disney conglomerate video partner in developing the new Disney franchises. While DCP eyed other potential franchises, DisneyToon looked to the [[Seven Dwarfs#The Walt Disney Company|Seven Dwarfs]] for a male-centric franchise to counterbalance the female-centric Fairies. By 2005, ''The Seven Dwarfs'' computer-animated sequel to ''Snow White'' was officially underway. [[Paul and Ga\u00ebtan Brizzi]] was one team that was given an attempt at a movie pitch, which was to follow the Dwarfs in which they trap the villain in the magic mirror and setting it up for ''Snow White'' movie. Given the possible demand, [[Disney Interactive Studios|Buena Vista Games]] brought in [[Obsidian Entertainment]], a game developer, who pitched a video game focusing on the Dwarfs' similar ancestors. DTS executives were not feeling that the two franchise launching projects were coming together well enough that they turned to [[Mike Disa]], who worked on the Tinker Bell movie story. Disa and [[Evan Spiliotopoulos]] pitched a ''[[Lord of the Rings]]''-style epic for the dwarfs while \"connecting seamlessly\" with the original movie, which was given permission to move forward. With interfering managers wanting a tragic back story for Dopey, Disa decided that he could not go forward. [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] chief creative officer [[John Lasseter]] about two month later ended production on the film.<ref name=av0>{{cite web|last1=Armstrong|first1=Josh|title=Mike Disa and The Seven Dwarfs: How the Snow White prequel became a Dopey movie|url=http://animatedviews.com/2013/mike-disa-and-the-seven-dwarfs-how-the-snow-white-prequel-became-a-dopey-movie/|website=Animated Views.com|publisher=Animated Views|accessdate=June 12, 2014|date=August 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n''[[The 7D]]'' is an American [[animated]] [[Television program|television series]] produced by [[Disney Television Animation]] franchise based on ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''. This series is the first [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Walt Disney Animation Studios]] classic series. The TV series details the 7D working for Queen Delightful where they protect Jollywood from the Glooms and other threats.<ref name=av0/>\n\nThe Seven Dwarfs were given a new theme park attraction called the [[Seven Dwarfs Mine Train]] coaster.<ref name=av0/>\n\nIn ''[[Descendants (2015 film)|Descendants]]'' and ''[[Descendants 2]]'', Dopey is shown to have a son named Doug (portrayed by Zachary Gibson) who can talk and becomes smitten by Evil Queen's daughter Evie. In the Descendants novel ''The Isle of the Lost'', Doc is shown to be sympathetic towards the Goblins that operate on the Isle of the Lost's Goblin Wharf where they want amnesty for their involvement with Maleficent.\n\n===[[Sesame Street]]===\nIn ''[[Sesame Street]]'', there were different versions of the Seven Dwarfs where each of them was made from Anything Muppets.\n* The Six Dwarfs seen in Episode 279 consisted of Sparky (performed by [[Jerry Nelson]]), Snooky (performed by [[Jerry Nelson]]), Pokey (performed by [[Jim Henson]]), Flakey (performed by [[Jim Henson]]), Drippy (performed by [[Jerry Nelson]]), and Sneaky (performed by [[Jim Henson]]). Snow White visited their house instead of the Seven Dwarfs by mistake and was able to see the difference.\n* In a [[Sesame Street News Flash]] that was seen in Episode 2787, the Seven Emotional Dwarfs appear where they were interviewed by [[Kermit the Frog]]. Their names are Cheerful (performed by [[Richard Hunt (puppeteer)|Richard Hunt]]), Sad (performed by [[Kevin Clash]]), Angry (performed by [[Jerry Nelson]]), Proud (performed by [[Martin P. Robinson]]), Fearful (performed by [[David Rudman]]), Lovey (performed by James Kroupa), and Surprised (performed by [[Jim Martin (puppeteer)|Jim Martin]]).\n* In Episode 4114, the Seven Dwarfs appear opposite Snow White (played by [[Amy Sedaris]]). The Seven Dwarfs consist of Clumsy (performed by [[Joey Mazzarino]]), Vertigo (performed by [[Fran Brill]]), Gassy (performed by [[Matt Vogel (puppeteer)|Matt Vogel]]), Itchy (performed by [[Carmen Osbahr]]), Smelly (performed by [[Martin P. Robinson]]), Sensitive-Nose (performed by Ryan Dillon), and Hammy (performed by [[Eric Jacobson]]).\n\n===Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics===\nIn the \"Snow White\" episode of ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics]]'', the Seven Dwarfs are named Sunday (voiced by Clifton Wells in the English dub), Monday (voiced by [[Kerrigan Mahan]] in the English dub), Tuesday, Wednesday (voiced by [[Tom Wyner]] in the English dub), Thursday, Friday (voiced by [[Michael Sorich]] in the English dub), and Saturday (voiced by [[Edward Mannix]] in the English dub) and are shown to be allied with a pack of wolves.\n\n===Happily Ever After===\nIn ''[[Happily Ever After (1993 film)|Happily Ever After]]'', it was mentioned that the Seven Dwarfs have opened up a mine in the next kingdom. In their place is the Seven Dwarfelles who have received a power based on nature to help out their boss [[Mother Nature]].\n\nThe Dwarfelles consisted of:\n* '''Muddy''' (voiced by [[Carol Channing]]) \u2013 A Dwarfelle who has power over the earth, and as such performs such tricks as causing minor tremors and such. She feels most comfortable playing in the mud.\n* '''Sunburn''' (voiced by [[Sally Kellerman]]) \u2013 A Dwarfelle who has power over sunlight, and is able to focus sun rays in any area and to whatever extremity she so wishes. She uses her power in the film to clear away clouds and summon down a beam of light to illuminate a dark cave. She has a New Yorker accent and attitude and her catchphrase is \"This really BURNS me up!\".\n* '''Blossom''' (voiced by [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]]) \u2013 A Dwarfelle who has power over plants and flowers, and is seen throughout the animation zapping the ground and having flowers spring up. It becomes apparent that her flora powers are less effective if the area is less natural or adaptable, as in the Realm of Doom. Blossom is very reminiscent of her voice actress with Gabor's mannerisms, penchant for the beautiful and fashionable, and even her signature accent.\n* '''Marina''' (voiced by [[Linda Gary]]) \u2013 A Dwarfelle who has power over all lakes and rivers, but the only example of her powers in the film is being able to breathe underwater. Marina carries herself as a gentlewoman and has a British accent.\n* '''Critterina''' (voiced by [[Linda Gary]]) \u2013 A Dwarfelle who has power of all animals who are created by Mother Nature. She is able to communicate with all animals, regardless of their creators, but does not have control over animals who are not Mother Nature's work like Lord Maliss' one-horned wolves. Although the other Dwarfelles are human in appearance, Critterina looks anthropomorphic. She aptly has a cowgirl mentality and a Texan accent.\n* '''Moonbeam''' (voiced by [[Tracey Ullman]]) \u2013 A Dwarfelle is never seen using her powers, but has the distinct characteristic of being in a deep slumber and sleepwalking in the day, and only awaking at night.\n* '''Thunderella''' (voiced by [[Tracey Ullman]]) \u2013 The seventh and youngest Dwarfelle, and is considered the 'black sheep' of the seven because of her inability to control her powers. She has power over weather, and always seems to mess her attempts at creating storms. She ends up saving the day by hitting Lord Maliss with a bolt of lightning she creates from her fingertip.\n\nThe Dwarfelles helped Snow White on her quest to rescue the Prince from the Queen's sorcerer brother Lord Maliss.\n\n===Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child===\nIn ''[[Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child]]'', the show's adaption of \"Snow White\" that takes place in the American southwest depicts the Seven Dwarves as seven mystical little men who came from the north to mine turquoise. They consist of:\n\n* '''Bright Silver''' (voiced by [[Pato Hoffmann]]) \u2013 The leader of the seven little men.\n* '''Fool's Gold''' (voiced by [[Burr DeBenning]]) \u2013 The clumsiest little man.\n* '''Smelly Sulfur''' (voiced by [[Burr DeBenning]]) \u2013 The smelliest little man.\n* '''Hard Jade''' (voiced by Tim Sampson) \u2013 The strongest little man.\n* '''Rough Copper''' (voiced by Jim Great Elk Waters) \u2013 Named for his temper. \n* '''Sharp Flint''' (voiced by [[Michael Horse]]) \u2013 Named for his sharp tongue. \n* '''Heavy Metal''' (voiced by Sonny Skyhawk/Sonny Roubideaux) \u2013 The hungriest little man.\n\n===Shrek===\nThe Seven Dwarfs appear in the ''[[Shrek (franchise)|Shrek]]'' series.\n\nIn ''[[Shrek]]'', the Seven Dwarfs appear in the first film carrying Snow White's coffin. When they place the coffin on the table, Shrek says \"Oh no no no no! Dead broad off the table!\" One of the Dwarfs says \"Where else are we supposed to put it? The bed's already been taken.\" Shrek promptly finds the [[Big Bad Wolf]] in his bed.\n\nThey are seen again at the start of ''[[Shrek 2]]'', giving Shrek a ring engraved with \"I love you\" in flaming letters for Fiona (in an allusion to the [[One Ring]] from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'').\n\nIn ''[[Shrek the Third]]'', one of them is given to Fiona as a wedding present (as a [[babysitter]]) from Snow White who says she has six more at home.\n\nThe Seven Dwarfs are seen at the end of ''Scared Shrekless'' when Shrek and Fiona celebrate by egging them.\n \nIn ''[[Shrek The Musical]]'', one of the dwarfs [[Grumpy (dwarf)|Grumpy]] knew that he abandoned [[Farquaad]] in the woods as a child after his wife the princess [[The Princess and the Pea]] falls out of 25 mattresses. However, when the fairytale characters brought Grumpy to Farquaad's wedding, he reveals that he kicked Farquaad out because he was twenty-eight years old and living in his basement.\n\n===Mirror Mirror===\nIn ''[[Mirror Mirror (film)|Mirror Mirror]]'', the Seven Dwarfs work as [[highwayman|Highwaymen]] and rob from anyone that comes down their way by wearing boots with retractable stilts that make them look taller. The Seven Dwarfs consist of:\n* '''Will Grimm''' (played by [[Danny Woodburn]]) \u2013 The leader of the Seven Dwarfs. He is named after the Brothers Grimm.\n* '''Butcher''' (played by [[Martin Klebba]]) \u2013 A Dwarf that used to work as a [[butcher]].\n* '''Wolf''' (played by Sebastian Saraceno) \u2013 A Dwarf in a [[Gray wolf|wolf]] cape.\n* '''Napoleon''' (played by [[Jordan Prentice]]) \u2013 A Dwarf that wears a hat similar to [[Napoleon I|Napoleon Bonaparte]].\n* '''Half Pint''' (played by [[Mark Povinelli]]) \u2013 A Dwarf who has a crush on Snow White.\n* '''Grub''' (played by Joe Gnoffo) \u2013 A Dwarf who is always eating.\n* '''Chuck''' (played by Ronald Lee Clark) \u2013 A Dwarf who chuckles a lot.\n\nThe Seven Dwarfs help Snow White to form a resistance against Queen Clementianna.\n\n===Princesses===\nIn the ''Princesses'' series by [[Jim C. Hines]], the dwarfs are actually anthropomorphic elemental personifications, summoned by Snow to aid her based on a spell from one of her mother's books. The seven dwarfs represent Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Light, Shadow, and Magic, although the 'Magic' dwarf is essentially a spirit that just inhabits Snow and enhances her power rather than appearing on its own, with the others appearing in some form to represent their element. Although powerful fighters that will serve Snow loyally, the consequences of summoning them is that Snow must 'pay' the spirits with seven years of her life, with the result that she appears to be in her mid-thirties when she is really only in her early twenties. As a result, she has only summoned the dwarves twice, initially calling on their aid to help her defeat her mother before the series began, and summoning them again to help her and her allies defeat her mother's spirit in the first book in the series (she contemplated summoning them against to deal with the ruthless Wild Hunt in ''Red Riding's Revenge'', but was advised against it as the spiritual nature of the hunt meant that nobody could be sure if the dwarves could do anything against them).\n\n===Snow White and the Huntsman===\nIn ''[[Snow White and the Huntsman]]'', the Seven Dwarfs started out as eight dwarfs when they are encountered by Snow White and Eric the Huntsman while fleeing Queen Ravenna. The Seven Dwarfs are:\n* '''Beith''' (played by [[Ian McShane]]) \u2013 The leader of the Seven Dwarfs. His name is the name of the first letter (\"B\") in the [[Ogham]] alphabet.\n* '''Muir''' (played by [[Bob Hoskins]]) \u2013 The blind elder dwarf who possesses the powers of premonition and is the father of Quert. His name echoes ''muin'', the name of \"M\" in the Ogham alphabet.\n* '''Quert''' (played by [[Johnny Harris (actor)|Johnny Harris]]) \u2013 The son of Muir. His name echoes ''ceirt'', the name of \"Q\" in the Ogham alphabet.\n* '''Coll''' (played by [[Toby Jones]]) \u2013 The brother of Duir. His name is the name of \"C\" in the Ogham alphabet.\n* '''Duir''' (played by [[Eddie Marsan]]) \u2013 The brother of Coll. His name is the name of \"D\" in the Ogham alphabet.\n* '''Gort''' (played by [[Ray Winstone]]) \u2013 An ill-tempered dwarf. His name is the name of \"G\" in the Ogham alphabet.\n* '''Nion''' (played by [[Nick Frost]]) \u2013 Beith's right-hand dwarf. His name is the name of \"N\" in the Ogham alphabet (sometimes given as ''nuin'').\n* '''Gus''' (played by Brian Gleeson) \u2013 A dwarf who develops a bond with Snow White. He is killed during an attack by Queen Ravenna's men where he sacrifices his life to protect Snow White. His name does not correspond to an Ogham letter.\n\nThe Dwarfs were played by actors without dwarfism who had their faces digitally transmuted onto small bodies, prompting a protest from the [[Little People of America]].<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/dwarfs-threaten-100midget-march-over-snow-white-and-the-huntsman-film-7821156.html Dwarfs threaten '100-midget march' over Snow White and the Huntsman film], Guy Adams, The Independent (UK), Thursday 07 June 2012</ref>\n\n===Once Upon a Time===\nIn ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', the Seven Dwarfs (who started out as eight) are on the side of Snow White and go by their Disney names.\n\n* '''Grumpy''' (played by [[Lee Arenberg]]) is one of eight Dwarf brothers who hatched from their eggs at the same time. Like all dwarfs, he is immediately sent to work in the mines and is given an ax, which names him Dreamy. Because his egg was accidentally sprinkled with fairy dust by the fairy Nova, he dreams about her and falls in love with her. Later, he meets her and the pair make plans to buy a boat and see the world. However, the [[The Fairy with Turquoise Hair|Blue Fairy]] tells him that if he and Nova run away together, she will lose her wings and she will never be truly happy. To prevent this, Dreamy ends their relationship and breaks her heart. He returns to the mines the next day and breaks his ax mining; when he is given another, it ''renames'' him Grumpy. He is later caught possessing a stolen diamond, which he did not know was stolen, and is seen in [[King George (Once Upon a Time)|King George]]'s dungeon in a cell next to Snow White's. He is freed by Stealthy, one of his brothers, and he in turn frees Snow. As he and Stealthy escape, they are discovered by George and his guards and Stealthy is killed. Before the guards can kill Grumpy, Snow goes with George in exchange for Grumpy's life. Grumpy and the remaining six dwarfs run into Snow outside the castle. Grumpy tells her that she must live with the pain of a lost love to grow as a person and does not allow her to drink a potion that makes her forget about her love for [[Prince Charming|Prince James]]. The seven dwarfs then allow her to live with them. Later, Grumpy goes to tell her that James called off his wedding, but he discovers that she drank the potion. He and his brothers try to confront Snow about her new, mean-spirited behavior, but they drive her to try and kill the Evil Queen instead. He takes her to see [[Rumplestiltskin]], who gave her the potion, but he advises her on the best way to kill the Queen instead. Eventually, Snow regains her memory and apologizes to the dwarfs for her behavior. She decides to rescue James, who was captured by George, and Grumpy and his brothers go with her. Grumpy is later seen discussing the best course of action against the Evil Queen and her curse, calling for war. He is also seen as a guard looking out for the curse in a watchtower of Snow's and James's castle. In Storybrooke, he is '''Leroy''', a [[janitor]] at the hospital and the \"[[town drunk]].\" He, like the rest of Storybrooke, is hostile toward Mary Margaret, who is Snow White, after learning about her affair with David Nolan, who is Prince James. He meets Sister Astrid, who is Nova, and decides to help Mary Margaret sell candles for the nunnery and raise money for the nunnery's rent so that he can be near Astrid. When he and Mary Margaret fail to sell enough candles, he lies about the number they sold because he is unable to disappoint Astrid. He tries to sell his boat to Mr. Gold in the hopes that he will forgive the rent. Mr. Gold refuses. Astrid later learns about the candles and is upset that he lied. That night, Leroy causes a blackout, forcing the residents to buy candles. The candles sell out and the nunnery is able to pay its rent. Leroy then offers the grateful Astrid the opportunity to be the first passenger on his boat. Leroy's memories as Grumpy are restored when the curse is broken, and he hugs Snow when he next sees her. He wishes for Regina to be killed by the mob led by Dr. Whale, though he decides against it at Snow's insistence. He unites the Dwarfs together and they begin to mine for fairy dust again.\n* '''Sleepy''' (played by Faustino Di Bauda) \u2013 Sleepy is a sleepy dwarf who is one of the Seven Dwarfs. In Storybrooke, he is '''Walter''', a [[security guard]] that works at Storybrooke Hospital who occasionally dozes off on the job.\n* '''Sneezy''' (played by [[Gabe Khouth]]) \u2013 Sneezy is a dwarf who often sneezes and is one of the Seven Dwarfs. In Storybrooke, he is '''Tom Clark''', the owner of the Dark Star [[pharmacy]] where several characters are seen purchasing different products throughout the show. In Season 2, Sneezy joined the other dwarfs in an experiment that involved why the fairy tale characters can't leave Storybrooke. Upon drawing the shortest straw, Sneezy crossed the border out of Storybrooke and lost his memories of his past life in Fairy Tale Land once again.\n* '''Doc''' (played by [[David Paul Grove (actor)|David Paul Grove]]) \u2013 Doc is a dwarf who is one of the Seven Dwarfs. In Storybrooke, he still has his name but his occupation is unknown.\n* '''Bashful''' (played by Mig Micario) \u2013 Bashful is a dwarf who is one of the Seven Dwarfs. In Storybrooke, his human form is not named.\n* '''Dopey''' (played by Jeffrey Kaiser) \u2013 Dopey is a dwarf who is one of the Seven Dwarfs and has never spoken. In Storybrooke, his human form is not named.\n* '''Happy''' (played by [[Michael Coleman (actor)|Michael Coleman]]) \u2013 Happy is a dwarf who is one of the Seven Dwarfs. In Storybrooke, his human form is not named.\n\nThere were some other dwarfs that were associated with the Seven Dwarfs:\n* '''Stealthy''' (played by Geoff Gustafson) was a dwarf who used to be part of the Seven Dwarfs' group. He received his name from his axe like the other dwarfs because of his skillful infiltration abilities. He once tried to break Grumpy and Snow White out of his prison cell in King George's castle, but was killed during their escape. Grumpy would later comment, \"I miss Stealthy\", when trying to sneak into an enemy lair. He later ended up in the Underworld and after Henry gives him his unfinished business being his resentment towards Bashful he is able to move and ask Henry to tell his brother he misses them. In the Wish Realm, Stealthy is seen to be alive after Queen Snow and King David defeated the Evil Queen.\n* '''Bossy''' (played by Ken Kramer) is a dwarf who is also the leader of the other dwarfs.\n* '''Watchy''' (played by [[Richard Ian Cox]]) is a dwarf who watches over the dwarf eggs until they hatch.\n\n===The Goodies===\nIn the first episode of the final series of [[The Goodies]] (which was filmed at [[ITV Studios|ITV]]), The Goodies did a story set in a fairy tale world. Where they replaced three of the seven dwarfs (two of them died of exposure and another one was eaten by a gold fish). But they are later found out because of their height. The dwarfs take their names from the Disney movie (Sleepy, Happy, and Grumpy) while Graeme and Bill renamed themselves to fit in (Soppy and Gwotty). Only Tim kept his name.\n\n==Other dwarfs==<!-- See also -->\n* The 80s sitcom [[The Charmings]] contained one of the dwarfs, whose name was Luther.\n* The TV series [[Once Upon a Time (TV series)#Cultural references|''Once Upon a Time'']] (2012) uses the same names as \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" (1937). There is also an 8th dwarf called Stealthy, and a 9th honorary dwarf called Tiny. Grumpy was initially called Dreamy. Tiny (The Honorary Dwarf) was actually a Giant in the series (Once Upon a Time) before being cursed by Cora (The [[Evil Queen (Disney)|Evil Queen]]'s Mother) at which time he became human sized.\n* The Six Dwarfs in [[Sesame Street]] Episode 279 consisted of Sparky, Snooky, Pokey, Flakey, Drippy, and Sneaky.\n** In Episode 2787, the Seven Emotional Dwarfs are named Cheerful, Sad, Angry, Proud, Fearful, Lovey, and Surprised.\n** In Episode 18/10, the Seven Dwarfs were Clumsy, Vertigo, Gassy, Itchy, Smelly, Sensitive-Nose, and Hammy.\n* The Dwarfs in [[7 Dwarves \u2013 Men Alone in the Wood]] (and its sequels [[7 Zwerge \u2013 Der Wald ist nicht genug]] and [[The Seventh Dwarf]]) are Brummboss, Bubi, Cloudy, Cookie, Speedy, Sunny and Tschakko. When Brummboss leaves them after regaining the crown, he is replaced by Ralfie.\n*In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s fantasy world of [[Middle-earth]], the Seven [[Fathers of the Dwarves]] were the first of their people, and each the founder of a lineage. Tolkien's seven dwarves (note the spelling) are probably unique in literature, in being unconnected to the folktale of [[Snow White]]; although his imagined story bears echoes of the folklore motif of the Barbarossa legend (\"[[King asleep in mountain]]\") and the related motif \"[[Seven Sleepers]]\".<ref>Giddings, Robert; Holland, Elizabeth (1982) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6SYeAQAAIAAJ&q=%22barbarossa%22 J.R.R.

Snow White happens upon their house after being told by the [[Huntsman (Snow White)|Huntsman]] to flee from the [[Queen (Snow White)|Queen]]'s kingdom.\n\nThe Seven Dwarfs return home and immediately notice someone has sneaked in, because the house has been cleaned. During their loud discussion, they discover the sleeping Snow White. She wakes up and explains to them what happened. The Dwarfs take pity on her, saying: \"If you will keep house for us, and cook, make beds, wash, sew, and knit, and keep everything clean and orderly, then you can stay with us, and you shall have everything that you want.\" They warn her to be careful when alone at home, and to not let anyone in while they are [[wikt:delve#English|delving]] in the mountains.\n\nWhen the Queen disguised as an old [[peddler]] ties a colorful, silky [[bodice]] onto Snow White which causes her to faint, the Seven Dwarfs return just in time and Snow White revives when the Dwarfs loosen the lace. When the Queen dresses as a [[comb]] seller and gives Snow White a poisoned comb, the Seven Dwarfs save her again. The Queen then appears disguised as a [[farmer]]'s wife and gives Snow White a poisoned apple, of which she takes a bite. This time, the Seven Dwarfs are unable to revive the girl, because they can't find the source of Snow White's poor health and, assuming that she is dead, they place her in a glass [[coffin]]. After some time has passed, a Prince traveling through the land sees Snow White where he strides to her coffin, and instantly falls in love with her upon being enchanted by her beauty. The Prince kisses her which revives her.\n\n==Names==\nThe following is a list of names of the Seven Dwarfs from multiple versions of the [[Snow White]] story.

He is accident-prone and mute, with Happy explaining that he has simply \"never tried\" to speak. He is unvoiced like [[The Fox and the Cat#In Disney media|Gideon the Cat]] in ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', the title character as the circus elephant [[Dumbo]], and [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)#Disney's Peter Pan films|Tootles]] in ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]''.\n* '''Bashful''' (voiced by [[Scotty Mattraw]] in the film, [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 Bashful is very [[Shyness|shy]] and kind-hearted. He is also described as cute. He also has a rosy blushy face and a small shy smile.\n* '''Grumpy''' (voiced by [[Pinto Colvig]] in the film, [[Corey Burton]]) \u2013 Grumpy initially opposes [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]]'s presence in the dwarfs' home, but later warns her of the threat posed by the Queen and eagerly rushes to her aid upon realizing that she is in danger, leading the charge himself. He has the biggest nose of the dwarfs, and is frequently seen with one eye shut.\n* '''Sneezy''' (voiced by [[Billy Gilbert]] in the film, [[Bob Joles]]) \u2013 Sneezy's name is earned by his extraordinarily powerful sneezes (caused by [[hay fever]]), which are seen blowing even the heaviest of objects across a room.\n* '''Sleepy''' (voiced by [[Pinto Colvig]] in the film, [[Bill Farmer]]) \u2013 Sleepy is always tired and appears [[Lethargy|lethargic]] in most situations.\n* '''Happy''' (voiced by [[Otis Harlan]] in the film, [[Stephen Stanton]]) \u2013 Happy is the jovial dwarf and is usually portrayed laughing.\n\nThe Seven Dwarfs also appeared in ''[[Disney's House of Mouse|House of Mouse]]''.\n[[File:B-29 Doc McConnell Air Force Base July 17, 2016.jpg|thumb|Built during World War II, ''[[Doc (aircraft)|Doc]]'', a [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]], was named after one of the Seven Disney Dwarfs.]]\nIn the early 2000s, [[DisneyToon Studios]] (DTS) joined [[Disney Consumer Products]] (DCP) as their internal Disney conglomerate video partner in developing the new Disney franchises. While DCP eyed other potential franchises, DisneyToon looked to the [[Seven Dwarfs#The Walt Disney Company|Seven Dwarfs]] for a male-centric franchise to counterbalance the female-centric Fairies. By 2005, ''The Seven Dwarfs'' computer-animated sequel to ''Snow White'' was officially underway. [[Paul and Ga\u00ebtan Brizzi]] was one team that was given an attempt at a movie pitch, which was to follow the Dwarfs in which they trap the villain in the magic mirror and setting it up for ''Snow White'' movie. Given the possible demand, [[Disney Interactive Studios|Buena Vista Games]] brought in [[Obsidian Entertainment]], a game developer, who pitched a video game focusing on the Dwarfs' similar ancestors. DTS executives were not feeling that the two franchise launching projects were coming together well enough that they turned to [[Mike Disa]], who worked on the Tinker Bell movie story. Disa and [[Evan Spiliotopoulos]] pitched a ''[[Lord of the Rings]]''-style epic for the dwarfs while \"connecting seamlessly\" with the original movie, which was given permission to move forward. With interfering managers wanting a tragic back story for Dopey, Disa decided that he could not go forward. [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] chief creative officer [[John Lasseter]] about two month later ended production on the film.<ref name=av0>{{cite web|last1=Armstrong|first1=Josh|title=Mike Disa and The Seven Dwarfs: How the Snow White prequel became a Dopey movie|url=http://animatedviews.com/2013/mike-disa-and-the-seven-dwarfs-how-the-snow-white-prequel-became-a-dopey-movie/|website=Animated Views.com|publisher=Animated Views|accessdate=June 12, 2014|date=August 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n''[[The 7D]]'' is an American [[animated]] [[Television program|television series]] produced by [[Disney Television Animation]] franchise based on ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.

The TV series details the 7D working for Queen Delightful where they protect Jollywood from the Glooms and other threats.<ref name=av0/>\n\nThe Seven Dwarfs were given a new theme park attraction called the [[Seven Dwarfs Mine Train]] coaster.<ref name=av0/>\n\nIn ''[[Descendants (2015 film)|Descendants]]'' and ''[[Descendants 2]]'', Dopey is shown to have a son named Doug (portrayed by Zachary Gibson) who can talk and becomes smitten by Evil Queen's daughter Evie. In the Descendants novel ''The Isle of the Lost'', Doc is shown to be sympathetic towards the Goblins that operate on the Isle of the Lost's Goblin Wharf where they want amnesty for their involvement with Maleficent.\n\n===[[Sesame Street]]===\nIn ''[[Sesame Street]]'', there were different versions of the Seven Dwarfs where each of them was made from Anything Muppets.\n* The Six Dwarfs seen in Episode 279 consisted of Sparky (performed by [[Jerry Nelson]]), Snooky (performed by [[Jerry Nelson]]), Pokey (performed by [[Jim Henson]]), Flakey (performed by [[Jim Henson]]), Drippy (performed by [[Jerry Nelson]]), and Sneaky (performed by [[Jim Henson]]). Snow White visited their house instead of the Seven Dwarfs by mistake and was able to see the difference.\n* In a [[Sesame Street News Flash]] that was seen in Episode 2787, the Seven Emotional Dwarfs appear where they were interviewed by [[Kermit the Frog]]. Their names are Cheerful (performed by [[Richard Hunt (puppeteer)|Richard Hunt]]), Sad (performed by [[Kevin Clash]]), Angry (performed by [[Jerry Nelson]]), Proud (performed by [[Martin P. Robinson]]), Fearful (performed by [[David Rudman]]), Lovey (performed by James Kroupa), and Surprised (performed by [[Jim Martin (puppeteer)|Jim Martin]]).\n* In Episode 4114, the Seven Dwarfs appear opposite Snow White (played by [[Amy Sedaris]]). The Seven Dwarfs consist of Clumsy (performed by [[Joey Mazzarino]]), Vertigo (performed by [[Fran Brill]]), Gassy (performed by [[Matt Vogel (puppeteer)|Matt Vogel]]), Itchy (performed by [[Carmen Osbahr]]), Smelly (performed by [[Martin P. Robinson]]), Sensitive-Nose (performed by Ryan Dillon), and Hammy (performed by [[Eric Jacobson]]).\n\n===Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics===\nIn the \"Snow White\" episode of ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics]]'', the Seven Dwarfs are named Sunday (voiced by Clifton Wells in the English dub), Monday (voiced by [[Kerrigan Mahan]] in the English dub), Tuesday, Wednesday (voiced by [[Tom Wyner]] in the English dub), Thursday, Friday (voiced by [[Michael Sorich]] in the English dub), and Saturday (voiced by [[Edward Mannix]] in the English dub) and are shown to be allied with a pack of wolves.\n\n===Happily Ever After===\nIn ''[[Happily Ever After (1993 film)|Happily Ever After]]'', it was mentioned that the Seven Dwarfs have opened up a mine in the next kingdom. In their place is the Seven Dwarfelles who have received a power based on nature to help out their boss [[Mother Nature]].\n\nThe Dwarfelles consisted of:\n* '''Muddy''' (voiced by [[Carol Channing]]) \u2013 A Dwarfelle who has power over the earth, and as such performs such tricks as causing minor tremors and such. She feels most comfortable playing in the mud.\n* '''Sunburn''' (voiced by [[Sally Kellerman]]) \u2013 A Dwarfelle who has power over sunlight, and is able to focus sun rays in any area and to whatever extremity she so wishes. She uses her power in the film to clear away clouds and summon down a beam of light to illuminate a dark cave. She has a New Yorker accent and attitude and her catchphrase is \"This really BURNS me up!\".\n* '''Blossom''' (voiced by [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]]) \u2013 A Dwarfelle who has power over plants and flowers, and is seen throughout the animation zapping the ground and having flowers spring up. It becomes apparent that her flora powers are less effective if the area is less natural or adaptable, as in the Realm of Doom. Blossom is very reminiscent of her voice actress with Gabor's mannerisms, penchant for the beautiful and fashionable, and even her signature accent.\n* '''Marina''' (voiced by [[Linda Gary]]) \u2013 A Dwarfelle who has power over all lakes and rivers, but the only example of her powers in the film is being able to breathe underwater. Marina carries herself as a gentlewoman and has a British accent.\n* '''Critterina''' (voiced by [[Linda Gary]]) \u2013 A Dwarfelle who has power of all animals who are created by Mother Nature. She is able to communicate with all animals, regardless of their creators, but does not have control over animals who are not Mother Nature's work like Lord Maliss' one-horned wolves. Although the other Dwarfelles are human in appearance, Critterina looks anthropomorphic. She aptly has a cowgirl mentality and a Texan accent.\n* '''Moonbeam''' (voiced by [[Tracey Ullman]]) \u2013 A Dwarfelle is never seen using her powers, but has the distinct characteristic of being in a deep slumber and sleepwalking in the day, and only awaking at night.\n* '''Thunderella''' (voiced by [[Tracey Ullman]]) \u2013 The seventh and youngest Dwarfelle, and is considered the 'black sheep' of the seven because of her inability to control her powers. She has power over weather, and always seems to mess her attempts at creating storms. She ends up saving the day by hitting Lord Maliss with a bolt of lightning she creates from her fingertip.\n\nThe Dwarfelles helped Snow White on her quest to rescue the Prince from the Queen's sorcerer brother Lord Maliss.\n\n===Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child===\nIn ''[[Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child]]'', the show's adaption of \"Snow White\" that takes place in the American southwest depicts the Seven Dwarves as seven mystical little men who came from the north to mine turquoise. They consist of:\n\n* '''Bright Silver''' (voiced by [[Pato Hoffmann]]) \u2013 The leader of the seven little men.\n* '''Fool's Gold''' (voiced by [[Burr DeBenning]]) \u2013 The clumsiest little man.\n* '''Smelly Sulfur''' (voiced by [[Burr DeBenning]]) \u2013 The smelliest little man.\n* '''Hard Jade''' (voiced by Tim Sampson) \u2013 The strongest little man.\n* '''Rough Copper''' (voiced by Jim Great Elk Waters) \u2013 Named for his temper. \n* '''Sharp Flint''' (voiced by [[Michael Horse]]) \u2013 Named for his sharp tongue. \n* '''Heavy Metal''' (voiced by Sonny Skyhawk/Sonny Roubideaux) \u2013 The hungriest little man.\n\n===Shrek===\nThe Seven Dwarfs appear in the ''[[Shrek (franchise)|Shrek]]'' series.\n\nIn ''[[Shrek]]'', the Seven Dwarfs appear in the first film carrying Snow White's coffin. When they place the coffin on the table, Shrek says \"Oh no no no no! Dead broad off the table!\" One of the Dwarfs says \"Where else are we supposed to put it? The bed's already been taken.\" Shrek promptly finds the [[Big Bad Wolf]] in his bed.\n\nThey are seen again at the start of ''[[Shrek 2]]'', giving Shrek a ring engraved with \"I love you\" in flaming letters for Fiona (in an allusion to the [[One Ring]] from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'').\n\nIn ''[[Shrek the Third]]'', one of them is given to Fiona as a wedding present (as a [[babysitter]]) from Snow White who says she has six more at home.\n\nThe Seven Dwarfs are seen at the end of ''Scared Shrekless'' when Shrek and Fiona celebrate by egging them.\n \nIn ''[[Shrek The Musical]]'', one of the dwarfs [[Grumpy (dwarf)|Grumpy]] knew that he abandoned [[Farquaad]] in the woods as a child after his wife the princess [[The Princess and the Pea]] falls out of 25 mattresses. However, when the fairytale characters brought Grumpy to Farquaad's wedding, he reveals that he kicked Farquaad out because he was twenty-eight years old and living in his basement.\n\n===Mirror Mirror===\nIn ''[[Mirror Mirror (film)|Mirror Mirror]]'', the Seven Dwarfs work as [[highwayman|Highwaymen]] and rob from anyone that comes down their way by wearing boots with retractable stilts that make them look taller. The Seven Dwarfs consist of:\n* '''Will Grimm''' (played by [[Danny Woodburn]]) \u2013 The leader of the Seven Dwarfs. He is named after the Brothers Grimm.\n* '''Butcher''' (played by [[Martin Klebba]]) \u2013 A Dwarf that used to work as a [[butcher]].\n* '''Wolf''' (played by Sebastian Saraceno) \u2013 A Dwarf in a [[Gray wolf|wolf]] cape.\n* '''Napoleon''' (played by [[Jordan Prentice]]) \u2013 A Dwarf that wears a hat similar to [[Napoleon I|Napoleon Bonaparte]].\n* '''Half Pint''' (played by [[Mark Povinelli]]) \u2013 A Dwarf who has a crush on Snow White.\n* '''Grub''' (played by Joe Gnoffo) \u2013 A Dwarf who is always eating.\n* '''Chuck''' (played by Ronald Lee Clark) \u2013 A Dwarf who chuckles a lot.\n\nThe Seven Dwarfs help Snow White to form a resistance against Queen Clementianna.\n\n===Princesses===\nIn the ''Princesses'' series by [[Jim C. Hines]], the dwarfs are actually anthropomorphic elemental personifications, summoned by Snow to aid her based on a spell from one of her mother's books. The seven dwarfs represent Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Light, Shadow, and Magic, although the 'Magic' dwarf is essentially a spirit that just inhabits Snow and enhances her power rather than appearing on its own, with the others appearing in some form to represent their element. Although powerful fighters that will serve Snow loyally, the consequences of summoning them is that Snow must 'pay' the spirits with seven years of her life, with the result that she appears to be in her mid-thirties when she is really only in her early twenties. As a result, she has only summoned the dwarves twice, initially calling on their aid to help her defeat her mother before the series began, and summoning them again to help her and her allies defeat her mother's spirit in the first book in the series (she contemplated summoning them against to deal with the ruthless Wild Hunt in ''Red Riding's Revenge'', but was advised against it as the spiritual nature of the hunt meant that nobody could be sure if the dwarves could do anything against them).\n\n===Snow White and the Huntsman===\nIn ''[[Snow White and the Huntsman]]'', the Seven Dwarfs started out as eight dwarfs when they are encountered by Snow White and Eric the Huntsman while fleeing Queen Ravenna. The Seven Dwarfs are:\n* '''Beith''' (played by [[Ian McShane]]) \u2013 The leader of the Seven Dwarfs. His name is the name of the first letter (\"B\") in the [[Ogham]] alphabet.\n* '''Muir''' (played by [[Bob Hoskins]]) \u2013 The blind elder dwarf who possesses the powers of premonition and is the father of Quert. His name echoes ''muin'', the name of \"M\" in the Ogham alphabet.\n* '''Quert''' (played by [[Johnny Harris (actor)|Johnny Harris]]) \u2013 The son of Muir. His name echoes ''ceirt'', the name of \"Q\" in the Ogham alphabet.\n* '''Coll''' (played by [[Toby Jones]]) \u2013 The brother of Duir. His name is the name of \"C\" in the Ogham alphabet.\n* '''Duir''' (played by [[Eddie Marsan]]) \u2013 The brother of Coll. His name is the name of \"D\" in the Ogham alphabet.\n* '''Gort''' (played by [[Ray Winstone]]) \u2013 An ill-tempered dwarf. His name is the name of \"G\" in the Ogham alphabet.\n* '''Nion''' (played by [[Nick Frost]]) \u2013 Beith's right-hand dwarf. His name is the name of \"N\" in the Ogham alphabet (sometimes given as ''nuin'').\n* '''Gus''' (played by Brian Gleeson) \u2013 A dwarf who develops a bond with Snow White. He is killed during an attack by Queen Ravenna's men where he sacrifices his life to protect Snow White. His name does not correspond to an Ogham letter.\n\nThe Dwarfs were played by actors without dwarfism who had their faces digitally transmuted onto small bodies, prompting a protest from the [[Little People of America]].<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/dwarfs-threaten-100midget-march-over-snow-white-and-the-huntsman-film-7821156.html Dwarfs threaten '100-midget march' over Snow White and the Huntsman film], Guy Adams, The Independent (UK), Thursday 07 June 2012</ref>\n\n===Once Upon a Time===\nIn ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', the Seven Dwarfs (who started out as eight) are on the side of Snow White and go by their Disney names.\n\n* '''Grumpy''' (played by [[Lee Arenberg]]) is one of eight Dwarf brothers who hatched from their eggs at the same time. Like all dwarfs, he is immediately sent to work in the mines and is given an ax, which names him Dreamy. Because his egg was accidentally sprinkled with fairy dust by the fairy Nova, he dreams about her and falls in love with her. Later, he meets her and the pair make plans to buy a boat and see the world. However, the [[The Fairy with Turquoise Hair|Blue Fairy]] tells him that if he and Nova run away together, she will lose her wings and she will never be truly happy. To prevent this, Dreamy ends their relationship and breaks her heart. He returns to the mines the next day and breaks his ax mining; when he is given another, it ''renames'' him Grumpy. He is later caught possessing a stolen diamond, which he did not know was stolen, and is seen in [[King George (Once Upon a Time)|King George]]'s dungeon in a cell next to Snow White's. He is freed by Stealthy, one of his brothers, and he in turn frees Snow. As he and Stealthy escape, they are discovered by George and his guards and Stealthy is killed. Before the guards can kill Grumpy, Snow goes with George in exchange for Grumpy's life. Grumpy and the remaining six dwarfs run into Snow outside the castle. Grumpy tells her that she must live with the pain of a lost love to grow as a person and does not allow her to drink a potion that makes her forget about her love for [[Prince Charming|Prince James]]. The seven dwarfs then allow her to live with them. Later, Grumpy goes to tell her that James called off his wedding, but he discovers that she drank the potion. He and his brothers try to confront Snow about her new, mean-spirited behavior, but they drive her to try and kill the Evil Queen instead. He takes her to see [[Rumplestiltskin]], who gave her the potion, but he advises her on the best way to kill the Queen instead. Eventually, Snow regains her memory and apologizes to the dwarfs for her behavior. She decides to rescue James, who was captured by George, and Grumpy and his brothers go with her. Grumpy is later seen discussing the best course of action against the Evil Queen and her curse, calling for war. He is also seen as a guard looking out for the curse in a watchtower of Snow's and James's castle. In Storybrooke, he is '''Leroy''', a [[janitor]] at the hospital and the \"[[town drunk]].\" He, like the rest of Storybrooke, is hostile toward Mary Margaret, who is Snow White, after learning about her affair with David Nolan, who is Prince James. He meets Sister Astrid, who is Nova, and decides to help Mary Margaret sell candles for the nunnery and raise money for the nunnery's rent so that he can be near Astrid. When he and Mary Margaret fail to sell enough candles, he lies about the number they sold because he is unable to disappoint Astrid. He tries to sell his boat to Mr. Gold in the hopes that he will forgive the rent. Mr. Gold refuses. Astrid later learns about the candles and is upset that he lied. That night, Leroy causes a blackout, forcing the residents to buy candles. The candles sell out and the nunnery is able to pay its rent. Leroy then offers the grateful Astrid the opportunity to be the first passenger on his boat. Leroy's memories as Grumpy are restored when the curse is broken, and he hugs Snow when he next sees her. He wishes for Regina to be killed by the mob led by Dr. Whale, though he decides against it at Snow's insistence. He unites the Dwarfs together and they begin to mine for fairy dust again.\n* '''Sleepy''' (played by Faustino Di Bauda) \u2013 Sleepy is a sleepy dwarf who is one of the Seven Dwarfs. In Storybrooke, he is '''Walter''', a [[security guard]] that works at Storybrooke Hospital who occasionally dozes off on the job.\n* '''Sneezy''' (played by [[Gabe Khouth]]) \u2013 Sneezy is a dwarf who often sneezes and is one of the Seven Dwarfs. In Storybrooke, he is '''Tom Clark''', the owner of the Dark Star [[pharmacy]] where several characters are seen purchasing different products throughout the show. In Season 2, Sneezy joined the other dwarfs in an experiment that involved why the fairy tale characters can't leave Storybrooke. Upon drawing the shortest straw, Sneezy crossed the border out of Storybrooke and lost his memories of his past life in Fairy Tale Land once again.\n* '''Doc''' (played by [[David Paul Grove (actor)|David Paul Grove]]) \u2013 Doc is a dwarf who is one of the Seven Dwarfs. In Storybrooke, he still has his name but his occupation is unknown.\n* '''Bashful''' (played by Mig Micario) \u2013 Bashful is a dwarf who is one of the Seven Dwarfs. In Storybrooke, his human form is not named.\n* '''Dopey''' (played by Jeffrey Kaiser) \u2013 Dopey is a dwarf who is one of the Seven Dwarfs and has never spoken. In Storybrooke, his human form is not named.\n* '''Happy''' (played by [[Michael Coleman (actor)|Michael Coleman]]) \u2013 Happy is a dwarf who is one of the Seven Dwarfs. In Storybrooke, his human form is not named.\n\nThere were some other dwarfs that were associated with the Seven Dwarfs:\n* '''Stealthy''' (played by Geoff Gustafson) was a dwarf who used to be part of the Seven Dwarfs' group. He received his name from his axe like the other dwarfs because of his skillful infiltration abilities. He once tried to break Grumpy and Snow White out of his prison cell in King George's castle, but was killed during their escape. Grumpy would later comment, \"I miss Stealthy\", when trying to sneak into an enemy lair. He later ended up in the Underworld and after Henry gives him his unfinished business being his resentment towards Bashful he is able to move and ask Henry to tell his brother he misses them. In the Wish Realm, Stealthy is seen to be alive after Queen Snow and King David defeated the Evil Queen.\n* '''Bossy''' (played by Ken Kramer) is a dwarf who is also the leader of the other dwarfs.\n* '''Watchy''' (played by [[Richard Ian Cox]]) is a dwarf who watches over the dwarf eggs until they hatch.\n\n===The Goodies===\nIn the first episode of the final series of [[The Goodies]] (which was filmed at [[ITV Studios|ITV]]), The Goodies did a story set in a fairy tale world. Where they replaced three of the seven dwarfs (two of them died of exposure and another one was eaten by a gold fish). But they are later found out because of their height. The dwarfs take their names from the Disney movie (Sleepy, Happy, and Grumpy) while Graeme and Bill renamed themselves to fit in (Soppy and Gwotty). Only Tim kept his name.\n\n==Other dwarfs==<!-- See also -->\n* The 80s sitcom [[The Charmings]] contained one of the dwarfs, whose name was Luther.\n* The TV series [[Once Upon a Time (TV series)#Cultural references|''Once Upon a Time'']] (2012) uses the same names as \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" (1937). There is also an 8th dwarf called Stealthy, and a 9th honorary dwarf called Tiny. Grumpy was initially called Dreamy. Tiny (The Honorary Dwarf) was actually a Giant in the series (Once Upon a Time) before being cursed by Cora (The [[Evil Queen (Disney)|Evil Queen]]'s Mother) at which time he became human sized.\n* The Six Dwarfs in [[Sesame Street]] Episode 279 consisted of Sparky, Snooky, Pokey, Flakey, Drippy, and Sneaky.\n** In Episode 2787, the Seven Emotional Dwarfs are named Cheerful, Sad, Angry, Proud, Fearful, Lovey, and Surprised.\n** In Episode 18/10, the Seven Dwarfs were Clumsy, Vertigo, Gassy, Itchy, Smelly, Sensitive-Nose, and Hammy.\n* The Dwarfs in [[7 Dwarves \u2013 Men Alone in the Wood]] (and its sequels [[7 Zwerge \u2013 Der Wald ist nicht genug]] and [[The Seventh Dwarf]]) are Brummboss, Bubi, Cloudy, Cookie, Speedy, Sunny and Tschakko. When Brummboss leaves them after regaining the crown, he is replaced by Ralfie.\n*In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s fantasy world of [[Middle-earth]], the Seven [[Fathers of the Dwarves]] were the first of their people, and each the founder of a lineage. Tolkien's seven dwarves (note the spelling) are probably unique in literature, in being unconnected to the folktale of [[Snow White]]; although his imagined story bears echoes of the folklore motif of the Barbarossa legend (\"[[King asleep in mountain]]\") and the related motif \"[[Seven Sleepers]]\".<ref>Giddings, Robert; Holland, Elizabeth (1982) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6SYeAQAAIAAJ&q=%22barbarossa%22 J.R.R.
