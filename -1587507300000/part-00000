Its founding was pushed forward by Reverend H. L. Turner.\n\nWhen it received a provincial charter to grant theological degrees in 1949, it was renamed Winnipeg Bible Institute and College of Theology\n\nThe college started a full degree-granting program and was renamed Winnipeg Bible College in 1963.\n\nIn 1970, facing the demolition of its quarters, shortfall in funds, and low enrolment, the college moved 50 kilometers south to Otterburne, Man., where it acquired the vacant building of the former St. Joseph's College, a Roman Catholic high school. Enrollment that year was 70 students.\n\nA graduate division was formed as Providence Theological Seminary in 1972, which had full membership in the Association of Theological Schools (ATS). In 1992 the school was renamed Providence College and Theological Seminary. For the academic year of 2009-10 more than 200 students had enrolled. The name was further changed in 2011 to Providence University College and Theological Seminary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.providencecollege.ca/college/about_us/history/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101002185410/http://www.providencecollege.ca/college/about_us/history/ |archivedate=2010-10-02 }}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n\n===Providence University College===\n\nProvidence University College offers Bachelor of Arts degrees with majors in Communications and Media, Biblical and Theological Studies, Business Administration, TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages), Humanities, and Social Sciences.<ref>http://prov.ca/College/col_academics.aspx</ref>\n\nProvidence University College has the following faculties.\n\n* Biblical and Theological Studies.

In some cases, up to one year of courses can be studied on-line.\n\nBecause the faculty and student body are international in scope, professors and students bring an enriching range of perspectives and experiences to the classroom setting and broader community life.\n\nThe seminary publishes the journal ''[[Didaskalia (journal)|Didaskalia]]''.\n\n===William Falk Library and Learning Resource Centre===\nProvidence College and Seminary proposed to improve the library facilities through the construction of this new learning resource centre.

The College offers over 200 courses that are transferable to [[University of Manitoba]]. Students can also transfer many courses to other Canadian educational institutions such as [[Brandon University]] and the [[University of Winnipeg]].\n\n== History (synopsis) ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}\nThe Winnipeg Bible Training School was founded in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada in 1925, and renamed a short time later to Winnipeg Bible Institute. Its founding was pushed forward by Reverend H. L. Turner.\n\nWhen it received a provincial charter to grant theological degrees in 1949, it was renamed Winnipeg Bible Institute and College of Theology\n\nThe college started a full degree-granting program and was renamed Winnipeg Bible College in 1963.\n\nIn 1970, facing the demolition of its quarters, shortfall in funds, and low enrolment, the college moved 50 kilometers south to Otterburne, Man., where it acquired the vacant building of the former St. Joseph's College, a Roman Catholic high school. Enrollment that year was 70 students.\n\nA graduate division was formed as Providence Theological Seminary in 1972, which had full membership in the Association of Theological Schools (ATS). In 1992 the school was renamed Providence College and Theological Seminary. For the academic year of 2009-10 more than 200 students had enrolled. The name was further changed in 2011 to Providence University College and Theological Seminary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.providencecollege.ca/college/about_us/history/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101002185410/http://www.providencecollege.ca/college/about_us/history/ |archivedate=2010-10-02 }}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n\n===Providence University College===\n\nProvidence University College offers Bachelor of Arts degrees with majors in Communications and Media, Biblical and Theological Studies, Business Administration, TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages), Humanities, and Social Sciences.<ref>http://prov.ca/College/col_academics.aspx</ref>\n\nProvidence University College has the following faculties.\n\n* Biblical and Theological Studies. Providence College's core is in Biblical and Theological Studies. It is offered to students in three different programs: a 1-year Certificate in Biblical and Theological Studies; 3-year B.A. degrees in Old Testament, New Testament, and Theology; and 4-year B.A. degrees in Old Testament, New Testament, and Theology.\n* Business Administration\n* Communications and Media\n* Aviation - studies in career and missionary flight\n* Youth Leadership\n* Humanities\n* Social Sciences\n\nProvidence University College is also home to an English Language Institute which prepares international students, whose first language is not English, for successful academic studies at the post-secondary level.\n\nThe inter-denominational evangelical Providence Theological Seminary prepares workers for service in global ministries, pastoral ministry, counseling, TESOL, and wider Christian service.\n\n===Providence Theological Seminary===\n\nThe seminary offers one-year certificates and Master of Arts (in a range of majors and programs), Master of Divinity (in two tracks), and Doctor of Ministry degrees. The various programs offer options for students seeking ordination, advanced training, and general knowledge. Examples of majors (M.A.): global ministries, educational studies, counseling, theological studies, and Christian studies.\n\nFor a two- or three-year degree, a one-year residency is required. In some cases, up to one year of courses can be studied on-line.\n\nBecause the faculty and student body are international in scope, professors and students bring an enriching range of perspectives and experiences to the classroom setting and broader community life.\n\nThe seminary publishes the journal ''[[Didaskalia (journal)|Didaskalia]]''.\n\n===William Falk Library and Learning Resource Centre===\nProvidence College and Seminary proposed to improve the library facilities through the construction of this new learning resource centre.

Ideologically an [[African nationalism|African nationalist]] and [[African socialism|African socialist]], he was at the forefront of a grassroots anti-apartheid campaign known as the [[Black Consciousness Movement]] during the late 1960s and 1970s. His ideas were articulated in a series of articles published under the pseudonym '''Frank Talk'''.\n\n<!--Early life-->  \nRaised in a poor [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] family, Biko grew up in [[Ginsberg, Eastern Cape|Ginsberg township]] in the [[Eastern Cape]]. In 1966, he began studying medicine at the [[University of Natal]], where he joined the [[National Union of South African Students]] (NUSAS). Strongly opposed to the [[apartheid]] system of [[racial segregation]] and [[White South African|white-minority]] rule in South Africa, Biko was frustrated that NUSAS and other anti-apartheid groups were dominated by white [[liberalism|liberals]], rather than by the blacks who were most affected by apartheid. He believed that well-intentioned white liberals failed to comprehend the black experience and often acted in a [[paternalism|paternalistic]] manner. He developed the view that to avoid white domination, black people had to organise independently, and to this end he became a leading figure in the creation of the [[South African Students' Organisation]] (SASO) in 1968. Membership was open only to \"[[Black people|blacks]]\", a term that Biko used in reference not just to [[Bantu peoples in South Africa|Bantu-speaking Africans]] but also to [[Coloureds]] and [[Indian South Africans|Indians]]. He was careful to keep his movement independent of white liberals, but opposed anti-white racism and had white friends and lovers. The white-minority [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government were initially supportive, seeing SASO's creation as a victory for apartheid's ethos of racial separatism.\n\n<!--Later life-->  \nInfluenced by the [[Martinique|Martinican]] philosopher [[Frantz Fanon]] and the African-American [[Black Power movement]], Biko and his compatriots developed Black Consciousness as SASO's official ideology. The movement campaigned for an end to apartheid and the transition of South Africa toward [[universal suffrage]] and a [[Socialism|socialist economy]]. It organised Black Community Programmes (BCPs) and focused on the psychological empowerment of black people. Biko believed that black people needed to rid themselves of any sense of racial inferiority, an idea he expressed by popularizing the slogan \"[[black is beautiful]]\". In 1972, he was involved in founding the [[Black People's Convention]] (BPC) to promote Black Consciousness ideas among the wider population. The government came to see Biko as a subversive threat and placed him under a [[banning order]] in 1973, severely restricting his activities. He remained politically active, helping organise BCPs such as a healthcare centre and a cr\u00e8che in the Ginsberg area. During his ban he received repeated anonymous threats, and was detained by state security services on several occasions. Following his arrest in August 1977, Biko was beaten to death by state security officers. Over 20,000 people attended his funeral.\n\n<!--Reception and influence--> \nBiko's fame spread posthumously. He became the subject of numerous songs and works of art, while a 1978 biography by his friend [[Donald Woods]] formed the basis for the 1987 film ''[[Cry Freedom]]''. During Biko's life, the government alleged that he hated whites, various anti-apartheid activists accused him of [[sexism]], and African racial nationalists criticised his united front with Coloureds and Indians. Nonetheless, Biko became one of the earliest icons of the movement against apartheid, and is regarded as a political [[martyr (politics)|martyr]] and the \"Father of Black Consciousness\". His political legacy remains a matter of contention.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life: 1946\u20131966 ===\n\nBantu Stephen Biko was born on 18 December 1946,{{sfnm|1a1=Woods|1y=1978|1p=49|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2p=18|3a1=Hill|3y=2015|3p=xxi}} at his grandmother's house in [[Tarkastad]], [[Eastern Cape]].{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2012|1p=18|2a1=Hill|2y=2015|2p=xxi}} The third child of Mzingaye Mathew Biko and Alice 'Mamcete' Biko,{{sfnm|1a1=Smit|1y=1995|1p=18|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2p=18|3a1=Hill|3y=2015|3p=xxi}} he had an older sister, Bukelwa, an older brother, Khaya, and a younger sister, Nobandile.{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2012|1p=19|2a1=Mangcu|2y=2014|2p=89}} His parents had married in [[Whittlesea, Eastern Cape|Whittlesea]], where his father worked as a police officer. Mzingaye was transferred to [[Queenstown, Eastern Cape|Queenstown]], [[Port Elizabeth]], [[Fort Cox, Eastern Cape|Fort Cox]], and finally [[King William's Town]], where he and Alice settled in [[Ginsberg, Eastern Cape|Ginsberg township]].{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=19}} This was a settlement of around 800 families, with every four families sharing a water supply and toilet.{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=20}} Both [[Bantu peoples in South Africa|Bantu African]] and [[Coloureds|Coloured]] people lived in the [[township (South Africa)|township]],{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|p=235}} where [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]], [[Afrikaans]], and English were all spoken.{{sfn|Wilson|2012|pp=20, 22}} After resigning from the police force, Mzingaye worked as a clerk in the King William's Town Native Affairs Office,{{sfnm|1a1=Smit|1y=1995|1p=18|2a1=Mangcu|2y=2014|2p=88}} while studying for a law degree by correspondence from the [[University of South Africa]].{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2012|1p=19|2a1=Mangcu|2y=2014|2p=88}} Alice was employed first in domestic work for local white households, then as a cook at [[Grey Hospital]] in King William's Town.{{sfnm|1a1=Smit|1y=1995|1p=18|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2p=20}} According to his sister, it was this observation of his mother's difficult working conditions that resulted in Biko's earliest politicisation.{{sfn|Cock|1989|p=3}}\n\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-214-41-Derivative-01.jpg|thumb|left|Biko was briefly educated at the Lovedale boarding school in Alice.|alt=A black and white photograph of a large mansion house, surrounded by various trees]]\n\nBiko's given name \"Bantu\" means \"people\"; Biko interpreted this in terms of the saying ''\"Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu\"'' (\"a person is a person by means of other people\").{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=18}} As a child he was nicknamed \"Goofy\" and \"Xwaku-Xwaku\", the latter a reference to his unkempt appearance.{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|p=32}} He was raised in his family's [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa|Anglican]] Christian faith.{{sfnm|1a1=Woods|1y=1978|1p=96|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2p=19}} In 1950, when Biko was four, his father fell ill, was hospitalised in [[St. Matthew's Hospital]], [[Keiskammahoek]], and died,{{sfnm|1a1=Smit|1y=1995|1p=18|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2p=19|3a1=Mangcu|3y=2014|3p=88}} making the family dependent on his mother's income.{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=20}}\n\nBiko spent two years at St. Andrews Primary School and four at Charles Morgan Higher Primary School, both in Ginsberg.{{sfnm|1a1=Woods|1y=1978|1p=49|2a1=Smit|2y=1995|2p=18|3a1=Mangcu|3y=2014|3pp=97\u201398}} Regarded as a particularly intelligent pupil, he was allowed to [[grade skipping|skip a year]].{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|p=98}} In 1963 he transferred to the Forbes Grant Secondary School in the township.{{sfnm|1a1=Smit|1y=1995|1p=18|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2p=22|3a1=Mangcu|3y=2014|3pp=100\u2013101}} Biko excelled at maths and English and topped the class in his exams.{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|p=102}} In 1964 the Ginsberg community offered him a bursary to join his brother Khaya as a student at [[Lovedale (South Africa)|Lovedale]], a prestigious [[boarding school]] in [[Alice, Eastern Cape]].{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2012|1p=23|2a1=Mangcu|2y=2014|2pp=104\u2013105}} Within three months of Steve's arrival, Khaya was accused of having connections to [[Poqo]], the armed wing of the [[Pan Africanist Congress of Azania|Pan Africanist Congress]] (PAC), an [[African nationalism|African nationalist]] group which the government had banned. Both Khaya and Steve were arrested and interrogated by the police; the former was convicted, then acquitted on appeal.{{sfnm|1a1=Smit|1y=1995|1p=18|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2pp=23, 27|3a1=Mangcu|3y=2014|3p=106|4a1=Hill|4y=2015|4p=xxi}} No clear evidence of Steve's connection to Poqo was presented, but he was expelled from Lovedale.{{sfnm|1a1=Smit|1y=1995|1p=18|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2p=23|3a1=Mangcu|3y=2014|3p=107}} Commenting later on this situation, he stated: \"I began to develop an attitude which was much more directed at authority than at anything else. I hated authority like hell.\"{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=23}}\n\nFrom 1964 to 1965, Biko studied at St. Francis College, a [[Catholic Church in South Africa|Catholic]] boarding school in [[Mariannhill]], [[Natal Province|Natal]].{{sfnm|1a1=Woods|1y=1978|1p=49|2a1=Smit|2y=1995|2p=18|3a1=Wilson|3y=2012|3pp=24, 27|4a1=Mangcu|4y=2014|4p=108}} The college had a [[liberalism|liberal]] political culture, and Biko developed his political consciousness there.{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|pp=109\u2013110}} He became particularly interested in the replacement of South Africa's [[dominant minority|white minority]] [[South Africa#Republic|colonial government]] with an administration that represented the country's black majority.{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=25}} Among the [[anti-colonialism|anti-colonialist]] leaders who became Biko's heroes at this time were Algeria's [[Ahmed Ben Bella]] and Kenya's [[Jaramogi Oginga Odinga]].{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=25}} He later said that most of the \"politicos\" in his family were sympathetic to the PAC, which had [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] and African racialist ideas. Biko admired what he described as the PAC's \"terribly good organisation\" and the courage of many of its members, but he remained unconvinced by its racially exclusionary approach, believing that members of all racial groups should unite against the government.{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=27}} In December 1964, he travelled to [[Zwelitsha]] for the [[ulwaluko]] [[circumcision]] ceremony, symbolically marking his transition from boyhood to manhood.{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|pp=111\u2013112}}\n\n===Early student activism: 1966\u20131968===\n\n[[File:ApartheidSignEnglishAfrikaans.jpg|thumb|right|The apartheid system of racial segregation pervaded all areas of life; Biko was committed to its overthrow.|alt=A rectangular yellow wall plaque.

Instead they convinced him to choose medicine, a subject thought to have better career prospects.{{sfnm|1a1=Smit|1y=1995|1p=18|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2p=28}} He secured a scholarship,{{sfnm|1a1=Smit|1y=1995|1p=18|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2p=28}} and in 1966 entered the \"non-European\" section of the [[University of Natal]] Medical School in [[Wentworth, KwaZulu-Natal|Wentworth]], a township of [[Durban]].{{sfnm|1a1=Smit|1y=1995|1p=18|2a1=Woods|2y=1978|2p=49|3a1=Wilson|3y=2012|3pp=28\u201329|4a1=Mangcu|4y=2014|4p=113}} There, he joined what his biographer Xolela Mangcu called \"a peculiarly sophisticated and cosmopolitan group of students\" from across South Africa;{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|p=115}} many of them later held prominent roles in the post-apartheid era.{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|p=116}} The late 1960s was the heyday of radical student politics across the world, as reflected in the [[protests of 1968]],{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|p=150}} and Biko was eager to involve himself in this environment.{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=30}} Soon after he arrived at the university, he was elected to the Students' Representative Council (SRC).{{sfnm|1a1=Smit|1y=1995|1p=18|2a1=Mangcu|2y=2014|2p=117}}\n\nThe university's SRC was affiliated with the [[National Union of South African Students]] (NUSAS).{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|p=117}} NUSAS had taken pains to cultivate a multi-racial membership but remained white-dominated because the majority of South Africa's students were from the country's white minority.{{sfn|Woods|1978|p=31}} As Clive Nettleton, a white NUSAS leader, put it: \"the essence of the matter is that NUSAS was founded on white initiative, is financed by white money and reflects the opinions of the majority of its members who are white\".{{sfn|Woods|1978|p=32}} NUSAS officially opposed apartheid, but it moderated its opposition in order to maintain the support of conservative white students.{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|p=126}} Biko and several other black African NUSAS members were frustrated when it organised parties in white dormitories, which black Africans were forbidden to enter.{{sfn|Woods|1978|p=117}} In July 1967, a NUSAS conference was held at [[Rhodes University]] in [[Grahamstown]]; after the students arrived, they found that dormitory accommodation had been arranged for the white and [[Indian South Africans|Indian]] delegates but not the black Africans, who were told that they could sleep in a local church. Biko and other black African delegates walked out of the conference in anger.{{sfnm|1a1=Woods|1y=1978|1p=117|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2pp=30\u201331|3a1=Mangcu|3y=2014|3pp=123\u2013125}} Biko later related that this event forced him to rethink his belief in the multi-racial approach to political activism:{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=31}}\n\n<blockquote>I realized that for a long time I had been holding onto this whole dogma of nonracism almost like a religion&nbsp;...

Our main concern is the liberation of the blacks.\"{{sfn|Woods|1978|p=55}} Elsewhere, Biko argued that it was the responsibility of a vanguard movement to ensure that, in a post-apartheid society, the black majority would not seek vengeance upon the white minority.{{sfn|Ahluwalia|Zegeye|2001|p=462}} He stated that this would require an education of the black population in order to teach them how to live in a non-racial society.{{sfn|Ahluwalia|Zegeye|2001|p=462}}\n\n==Personality and personal life==\n\nTall and slim in his youth,{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=22}} by his twenties Biko was over six feet tall, with the \"bulky build of a heavyweight boxer carrying more weight than when in peak condition\", according to Woods.{{sfn|Woods|1978|p=54}} His friends regarded him as \"handsome, fearless, a brilliant thinker\".{{sfn|Bernstein|1978|p=6}} Woods saw him as \"unusually gifted&nbsp;...

Ideologically an [[African nationalism|African nationalist]] and [[African socialism|African socialist]], he was at the forefront of a grassroots anti-apartheid campaign known as the [[Black Consciousness Movement]] during the late 1960s and 1970s. His ideas were articulated in a series of articles published under the pseudonym '''Frank Talk'''.\n\n<!--Early life-->  \nRaised in a poor [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] family, Biko grew up in [[Ginsberg, Eastern Cape|Ginsberg township]] in the [[Eastern Cape]]. In 1966, he began studying medicine at the [[University of Natal]], where he joined the [[National Union of South African Students]] (NUSAS). Strongly opposed to the [[apartheid]] system of [[racial segregation]] and [[White South African|white-minority]] rule in South Africa, Biko was frustrated that NUSAS and other anti-apartheid groups were dominated by white [[liberalism|liberals]], rather than by the blacks who were most affected by apartheid. He believed that well-intentioned white liberals failed to comprehend the black experience and often acted in a [[paternalism|paternalistic]] manner. He developed the view that to avoid white domination, black people had to organise independently, and to this end he became a leading figure in the creation of the [[South African Students' Organisation]] (SASO) in 1968. Membership was open only to \"[[Black people|blacks]]\", a term that Biko used in reference not just to [[Bantu peoples in South Africa|Bantu-speaking Africans]] but also to [[Coloureds]] and [[Indian South Africans|Indians]]. He was careful to keep his movement independent of white liberals, but opposed anti-white racism and had white friends and lovers. The white-minority [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government were initially supportive, seeing SASO's creation as a victory for apartheid's ethos of racial separatism.\n\n<!--Later life-->  \nInfluenced by the [[Martinique|Martinican]] philosopher [[Frantz Fanon]] and the African-American [[Black Power movement]], Biko and his compatriots developed Black Consciousness as SASO's official ideology. The movement campaigned for an end to apartheid and the transition of South Africa toward [[universal suffrage]] and a [[Socialism|socialist economy]]. It organised Black Community Programmes (BCPs) and focused on the psychological empowerment of black people. Biko believed that black people needed to rid themselves of any sense of racial inferiority, an idea he expressed by popularizing the slogan \"[[black is beautiful]]\". In 1972, he was involved in founding the [[Black People's Convention]] (BPC) to promote Black Consciousness ideas among the wider population. The government came to see Biko as a subversive threat and placed him under a [[banning order]] in 1973, severely restricting his activities. He remained politically active, helping organise BCPs such as a healthcare centre and a cr\u00e8che in the Ginsberg area. During his ban he received repeated anonymous threats, and was detained by state security services on several occasions. Following his arrest in August 1977, Biko was beaten to death by state security officers. Over 20,000 people attended his funeral.\n\n<!--Reception and influence--> \nBiko's fame spread posthumously. He became the subject of numerous songs and works of art, while a 1978 biography by his friend [[Donald Woods]] formed the basis for the 1987 film ''[[Cry Freedom]]''. During Biko's life, the government alleged that he hated whites, various anti-apartheid activists accused him of [[sexism]], and African racial nationalists criticised his united front with Coloureds and Indians. Nonetheless, Biko became one of the earliest icons of the movement against apartheid, and is regarded as a political [[martyr (politics)|martyr]] and the \"Father of Black Consciousness\". His political legacy remains a matter of contention.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life: 1946\u20131966 ===\n\nBantu Stephen Biko was born on 18 December 1946,{{sfnm|1a1=Woods|1y=1978|1p=49|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2p=18|3a1=Hill|3y=2015|3p=xxi}} at his grandmother's house in [[Tarkastad]], [[Eastern Cape]].{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2012|1p=18|2a1=Hill|2y=2015|2p=xxi}} The third child of Mzingaye Mathew Biko and Alice 'Mamcete' Biko,{{sfnm|1a1=Smit|1y=1995|1p=18|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2p=18|3a1=Hill|3y=2015|3p=xxi}} he had an older sister, Bukelwa, an older brother, Khaya, and a younger sister, Nobandile.{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2012|1p=19|2a1=Mangcu|2y=2014|2p=89}} His parents had married in [[Whittlesea, Eastern Cape|Whittlesea]], where his father worked as a police officer.

Biko admired what he described as the PAC's \"terribly good organisation\" and the courage of many of its members, but he remained unconvinced by its racially exclusionary approach, believing that members of all racial groups should unite against the government.{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=27}} In December 1964, he travelled to [[Zwelitsha]] for the [[ulwaluko]] [[circumcision]] ceremony, symbolically marking his transition from boyhood to manhood.{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|pp=111\u2013112}}\n\n===Early student activism: 1966\u20131968===\n\n[[File:ApartheidSignEnglishAfrikaans.jpg|thumb|right|The apartheid system of racial segregation pervaded all areas of life; Biko was committed to its overthrow.|alt=A rectangular yellow wall plaque.

Under Woods' editorship, the newspaper had published articles criticising apartheid and the white-minority regime and had also given space to the views of various black groups, but not the BCM. Biko hoped to convince Woods to give the movement greater coverage and an outlet for its views.{{sfn|Woods|1978|p=55}} Woods was initially reticent, believing that Biko and the BCM advocated anti-white racism.{{sfn|Woods|1978|pp=45, 48}} When he met Biko for the first time, Woods expressed his concern about the anti-white liberal sentiment of Biko's early writings. Biko acknowledged that his earlier \"antiliberal\" writings were \"overkill\", but said that he remained committed to the basic message contained within them.{{sfn|Woods|1978|p=54}}\n\nOver the coming years the pair became close friends.{{sfn|Woods|1978|p=56}} Woods later related that, although he continued to have concerns about \"the unavoidably racist aspects of Black Consciousness\", it was \"both a revelation and education\" to socialise with blacks who had \"psychologically emancipated attitudes\".{{sfn|Woods|1978|pp=57, 58}} Biko also remained friends with another prominent white liberal, [[Duncan Innes]], who served as NUSAS President in 1969;

He nevertheless thought that white South Africans were poorly suited to this role because they had not personally experienced the oppression that their black counterparts faced.{{sfn|Kamola|2015|p=64}}\n\nBiko and his comrades regarded multi-racial anti-apartheid groups as unwittingly replicating the structure of apartheid because they contained whites in dominant positions of control.{{sfn|Kamola|2015|p=66}} For this reason, Biko and the others did not participate in these multi-racial organisations.{{sfn|Ahluwalia|Zegeye|2001|p=460}} Instead, they called for an anti-apartheid programme that was controlled by black people.{{sfn|Ahluwalia|Zegeye|2001|p=460}} Although he called on sympathetic whites to reject any concept that they themselves could be spokespeople for the black majority, Biko nevertheless believed that they had a place in the anti-apartheid struggle, asking them to focus their efforts on convincing the wider white community on the inevitability of apartheid's fall.{{sfn|Kamola|2015|p=65}} Biko clarified his position to Woods: \"I don't reject liberalism as such or white liberals as such. I reject only the concept that black liberation can be achieved through the leadership of white liberals.\"{{sfn|Woods|1978|p=54}} He added that \"the [white] liberal is no enemy, he's a friend&nbsp;\u2013 but for the moment he holds us back, offering a formula too gentle, too inadequate for our struggle\".{{sfn|Woods|1978|p=55}}\n\nBiko's approach to activism focused on psychological empowerment,{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|p=272}} and both he and the BCM saw their main purpose as combating the feeling of inferiority that most black South Africans experienced.{{sfn|Ahluwalia|Zegeye|2001|p=460}} Biko expressed dismay at how \"the black man has become a shell, a shadow of man&nbsp;... bearing the yoke of oppression with sheepish timidity\",{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=14}} and stated that \"the most potent weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed\".{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=14}} He believed that blacks needed to affirm their own humanity by overcoming their fears and believing themselves worthy of freedom and its attendant responsibilities.{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|p=278}} He defined Black Consciousness as \"an inward-looking process\" that would \"infuse people with pride and dignity\".{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=14}} To promote this, the BCM adopted the slogan \"Black is Beautiful\".{{sfn|Hill|2015|p=xviii}}\n\nOne of the ways that Biko and the BCM sought to achieve psychological empowerment was through community development.{{sfn|Hadfield|2010|p=80}} Community projects were seen not only as a way to alleviate poverty in black communities but also as a means of transforming society psychologically, culturally, and economically.{{sfn|Hadfield|2010|p=81}} They would also help students to learn about the \"daily struggles\" of ordinary black people and to spread Black Consciousness ideas among the population.{{sfn|Hadfield|2010|p=81}} Among the projects that SASO set its members to conduct in the holidays were repairs to schools, house-building, and instructions on financial management and agricultural techniques.{{sfn|Hadfield|2010|p=82}} Healthcare was also a priority, with SASO members focusing on primary and preventative care.{{sfn|Hadfield|2010|p=83}}\n\n===Foreign and domestic relations===\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = It becomes more necessary to see the truth as it is if you realise that the only vehicle for change are these people who have lost their personality.

In 2002, AZAPO issued a statement declaring that \"Biko was not a neutral, apolitical and mythical icon\" and that the ANC was \"scandalously\" using Biko's image to legitimise their \"weak\" government.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2253092.stm|title=Row clouds Biko anniversary|date=12 September 2002|work=BBC News|accessdate=18 December 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019160545/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2253092.stm|archivedate=19 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Members of the ANC have also criticised AZAPO's attitude to Biko; in 1997, Mandela said that \"Biko belongs to us all, not just AZAPO.\"{{sfn|Hill|2015|p=244}} On the anniversary of Biko's death in 2015, delegations from both the ANC and the [[Economic Freedom Fighters]] independently visited his grave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://city-press.news24.com/News/Bikos-grave-a-political-battleground-for-parties-20150912|title=Biko's grave a political battleground for parties|last=Ngcukana|first=Lubabalo|date=13 September 2016|website=City Press|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108110928/http://city-press.news24.com/News/Bikos-grave-a-political-battleground-for-parties-20150912|archivedate=8 January 2016|access-date=4 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In March 2017, the South African President [[Jacob Zuma]] laid a wreath at Biko's grave to mark [[Human Rights Day]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ewn.co.za/2017/03/21/zuma-lays-wreath-at-steve-biko-memorial-grave-site|title=Zuma Commemorates Biko on Human Rights Day|last=Ngcobo|first=Ziyanda|date=21 March 2017|website=Eyewitness News|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321121416/http://ewn.co.za/2017/03/21/zuma-lays-wreath-at-steve-biko-memorial-grave-site|archivedate=21 March 2017|access-date=4 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Commemoration===\n[[File:StevenBantuBiko'sGrave.jpg|thumb|upright|Biko's grave in [[Ginsberg, Eastern Cape|Ginsberg]] cemetery, King William's Town|alt=A grave and headstone.

Accelerated concurrent B.A.M., M.Div. resident degree programs are currently available through Prairie College in partnership with [[Taylor College and Seminary|Taylor Seminary]] of Edmonton, Alberta. Alternatively, accelerated concurrent B.A.M., M.Div. degree programs are accessible on-line through Prairie College Distance Education with [[Carey Theological College]] of Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nIn addition, the College offers 1 and 2-year Certificates and Diplomas, 2-year Associate and 4-year bachelor's degrees in the following vocational and interdisciplinary programs:\n\n* Aviation (AAMA) based at [[Three Hills Airport]]\n* Business Administration (BDBA)\n* Digital Media (Diploma)\n* Marketplace Ministry (BMM)\n* Practical Nursing (DipMin, LPN)\n* Primary Care Paramedic (Diploma Certification)\n* Songwriting and Recording (Diploma)\n* Sports Management (Diploma)\n* Sports Management and Leadership (BDSML)\n\nFrom its beginnings as a [[Bible college]], the governors of Prairie Bible Institute added the following scholastic divisions on its expanding campus: Prairie General Education (later named Prairie Christian Academy) in 1938, Prairie Distance Learning in the 1950s, Prairie Graduate School in 1988 (based in [[Calgary]] until 2004), Prairie School of Mission Aviation in 1992 and the Prairie College of Applied Arts and Technology in 2006. Eventually, Prairie Christian Academy was released to operate independently as its own local society and has been managed since 2004 by Golden Hills School Division #75. After further streamlining and restructuring, all of the remaining educational programs of the colleges of Prairie Bible Institute were brought under the administrative umbrella of one post-secondary unified school named Prairie College in 2015.\n\n==History==\n\nPrairie College's precursor was a local Bible Study group led by J. Fergus Kirk, a central Alberta [[Presbyterian]] farmer. [[L. E. Maxwell]], a graduate of a [[Christian and Missionary Alliance]] Bible Institute in Kansas City, was invited to come to Three Hills to develop a structured [[curriculum]].<ref>[http://www1.prairie.edu/pdf/sf/LEMaxwell_1923_letter-1.pdf First Hand Written Prospectus]</ref> He became the school's principal and later president. After 58 years, Maxwell retired in the spring of 1980 near the age of 85.  The current president of Prairie College is Mark Maxwell, the grandson of L. E. Maxwell.\n\nMaxwell, the Kirks, the McElherans, and other local families saw the school grow to attain an enrollment of over 900 students by 1948 and become Canada's largest bible college, a position it would hold until 1984. Although initially wary of outside alliances and influences, Prairie Bible Institute was officially incorporated and eventually [[educational accreditation|accredited]] to grant degrees in divinity through provincial legislative acts<ref>[http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/law/page.aspx?id=2988238 Incorporation, 1946]</ref><ref>[http://www.qp.alberta.ca/574.cfm?page=p19p5.cfm&leg_type=Acts&isbncln=9780779737932 Post-secondary Learning Act]</ref> and amendments<ref>[http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/law/page.aspx?id=3009216 Name change, 1971]</ref><ref>[http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/law/page.aspx?id=3025214 Power to grant degrees in divinity, 1980]</ref> of [[Monarchy in Alberta|Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Alberta]] and has conferred [[associate's degrees]] and [[Bachelor degree]]s to its graduates since 1980. From 1988 to 2004, PBI operated a graduate school and offered [[Master's degrees]] at a satellite campus in [[Calgary]]. During that same period, PBI reached undergraduate credit and programmic block transfer arrangements with The [[King's University College (Edmonton)|King's University College]] in Edmonton and the [[University of Lethbridge]] in southern Alberta and became accredited in 1997 when the [[Association for Biblical Higher Education]] accepted PBI as a full member.\n\nGraduate level education returned to Prairie in the fall of 2012 through reciprocal academic arrangements with [[Carey Theological College]], an [[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada|accredited seminary]] affiliated with the [[University of British Columbia|University of]] [[British Columbia]] of [[Vancouver]]. Currently, fourth year students in PBI's baccalaureate programs are eligible to receive one year's advanced standing toward a master's degree at Carey; alternatively, a student may enroll directly in Carey's seminary courses after completing three academic years at Prairie and have those graduate credits fulfill both fourth year bachelor's degree requirements at Prairie College as well as first year course requirements in one of Carey's graduate programs.\n\nIn 2019, Prairie College entered into a full partnership with [[Taylor College and Seminary|Taylor Seminary]] of [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]] to deliver accelerated hybrid B.A.M., M.Div. concurrent degrees which Prairie College students are able to achieve within 5 academic years through an integrated program of studies. Additionally, [[Carey Theological College]] and Prairie College enhanced their partnership with an accelerated 5 year B.A.M., M.Div. available in its entirety completely on-line to students around the world.\n\nIn 2020 Prairie College introduced a new master's degree program in Global Leadership in Christian Education.\n\nVentures initiated by Prairie were the Prairie Sunday School Mission, established in 1929, which was subsequently reorganized as the Alberta branch of the Canadian Sunday School Mission - later renamed as One Hope Canada. In 1933, at the invitation of Peace River area residents, Prairie College graduate Walter W. McNaughton traveled from Viking, Alberta, to Peace River country to establish the [[Peace River Bible Institute]], now located at Sexsmith, near the city of Grande Prairie. By the 1940s, Prairie had founded three general education Christian schools on its Three Hills campus: Prairie Elementary, Prairie Junior High, and Prairie High School. In 2004 these schools were amalgamated as Prairie Christian Academy (PCA) and began to operate independently from the Bible Institute. PCA now exists as one of Alberta's alternative schools under the local public school division.\n\nAnother outgrowth of the school was its own campus church, The Prairie Tabernacle Congregation. This fellowship met for more than fifty years in a cavernous auditorium seating 4,300. Remodeled and renamed in 1985, the Maxwell Memorial Tabernacle was Canada's largest religious auditorium. In 2005, the building was demolished so that a new multipurpose facility, The Maxwell Centre, could be built to house administrative offices and classrooms for Prairie College. As for Prairie Tabernacle Congregation, the fellowship initially moved its meeting place to the local Christian Academy and subsequently migrated to other facilities on the college campus. In January 2020, a new Prairie Tabernacle was officially opened for the congregation. This modern facility contains 17,000 square feet and is located on Highway 583 adjacent to the Prairie Christian Academy. It stands about 5 blocks east of the Prairie College campus.\n\nPrairie was one of the first Bible training institutes in Western Canada. Alumni were influential in the promotion of evangelical churches, especially congregations of the [[Christian and Missionary Alliance]] and the [[Evangelical Free Church]]. These, along with other [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] churches, employed graduates of Prairie and other rural Bible schools until they were able to establish their own denominational colleges and seminaries with campuses in urban and metropolitan areas of western Canada. Since its academic arrangements with Taylor Seminary in 2019 Prairie College has been endorsed as a partner school of the Alberta Baptist Association, a regional district of the [[North American Baptist Conference]].\n\nPrairie College now represents one of the most denominationally diversified theological faculties in the [[Council for Christian Colleges and Universities]] CCCU, with an [[Anglican]] priest, a graduate from [[Westminster Theological Seminary]], a [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan]], an [[Anabaptist]] former pastor, and several nondenominational professors.\n\n==Programs==\n\nToday, on its Three Hills campus in Alberta, Prairie Bible Institute operates Prairie College, a post-secondary undergraduate ministry and vocational centre of higher education; further Prairie College maintains active academic arrangements with Bow Valley College of Calgary and Carey Theological College of Vancouver:\n\n*'''Prairie College''' offers resident, commuter and distance education ministry programs with major concentrations in Biblical Studies, Theology, Church Ministries or Intercultural Studies culminating in an A.A.R.S., B.Min., B.Th., B.A., and a concurrent B.A.-M.Div. degree program with [[Taylor College and Seminary|Taylor Seminary]] of Edmonton, Alberta. All students in Prairie's four-year bachelor's degree programs have one year's access to and/or advanced standing in an accredited M.A. or M.Div. seminary degree program from '''Carey Theological College''' of Vancouver, British Columbia.    \n*As well, in each of the four-year bachelor's degree programs of Prairie College the students study the whole Biblical cannon in seven courses (three New Testament segments and four Old Testament segments). \n*Applied vocational programs of Prairie College include Aviation (based at [[Three Hills Airport]]) culminating in an Associate of Arts in Mission Aviation degree. Other Applied Arts and Technology programs are offered by Prairie College which lead to vocational diplomas or Associate of Arts degrees with incorporated provincially recognized diplomas in Digital Media, Emergency Medical Technology, Practical Nursing, Sports Management and other applied disciplines under consideration or development from partnering colleges, most notably [[Bow Valley College]] and [[Olds College]]. Prairie College also confers a four-year Bachelor of Marketplace Ministry which is an interdisciplinary ministry and vocational program of studies.\n\nThe school teaches creation as represented in the [[Book of Genesis]], including the view of Adam and Eve as historical figures.  In order to foster Christian development, most single first- and second-year students, as well as students in full-time flight training live in residence.\n\n==Athletics==\n\nThe Prairie College Pilots are a member of both the [[Alberta Colleges Athletic Conference]] and [[Prairie Athletic Conference]]. The school currently competes in men's and women's basketball, futsal, and volleyball, as well as cross country running and indoor track.\n\nPrairie is a former member of the Alberta Colleges Athletic League.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n\n* [[Don Richardson (missionary)|Don Richardson]]: Missionary and author\n* [[Ralph D.

Currently, fourth year students in PBI's baccalaureate programs are eligible to receive one year's advanced standing toward a master's degree at Carey; alternatively, a student may enroll directly in Carey's seminary courses after completing three academic years at Prairie and have those graduate credits fulfill both fourth year bachelor's degree requirements at Prairie College as well as first year course requirements in one of Carey's graduate programs. \n\nIn 2019, Prairie College entered into a full partnership with [[Taylor College and Seminary|Taylor Seminary]] of [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]] to deliver accelerated hybrid B.A.M., M.Div. concurrent degrees which Prairie College students are able to achieve within 5 academic years through an integrated program of studies. Additionally, [[Carey Theological College]] and Prairie College enhanced their partnership with an accelerated 5 year B.A.M., M.Div. available in its entirety completely on-line to students around the world.\n\nIn 2020 Prairie College introduced a new master's degree program in Global Leadership in Christian Education.\n\nVentures initiated by Prairie were the Prairie Sunday School Mission, established in 1929, which was subsequently reorganized as the Alberta branch of the Canadian Sunday School Mission - later renamed as One Hope Canada. In 1933, at the invitation of Peace River area residents, Prairie College graduate Walter W. McNaughton traveled from Viking, Alberta, to Peace River country to establish the [[Peace River Bible Institute]], now located at Sexsmith, near the city of Grande Prairie. By the 1940s, Prairie had founded three general education Christian schools on its Three Hills campus: Prairie Elementary, Prairie Junior High, and Prairie High School. In 2004 these schools were amalgamated as Prairie Christian Academy (PCA) and began to operate independently from the Bible Institute. PCA now exists as one of Alberta's alternative schools under the local public school division.\n\nAnother outgrowth of the school was its own campus church, The Prairie Tabernacle Congregation. This fellowship met for more than fifty years in a cavernous auditorium seating 4,300. Remodeled and renamed in 1985, the Maxwell Memorial Tabernacle was Canada's largest religious auditorium. In 2005, the building was demolished so that a new multipurpose facility, The Maxwell Centre, could be built to house administrative offices and classrooms for Prairie College. As for Prairie Tabernacle Congregation, the fellowship initially moved its meeting place to the local Christian Academy and subsequently migrated to other facilities on the college campus. In January 2020, a new Prairie Tabernacle was officially opened for the congregation. This modern facility contains 17,000 square feet and is located on Highway 583 adjacent to the Prairie Christian Academy. It stands about 5 blocks east of the Prairie College campus.\n\nPrairie was one of the first Bible training institutes in Western Canada. Alumni were influential in the promotion of evangelical churches, especially congregations of the [[Christian and Missionary Alliance]] and the [[Evangelical Free Church]]. These, along with other [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] churches, employed graduates of Prairie and other rural Bible schools until they were able to establish their own denominational colleges and seminaries with campuses in urban and metropolitan areas of western Canada. Since its academic arrangements with Taylor Seminary in 2019 Prairie College has been endorsed as a partner school of the Alberta Baptist Association, a regional district of the [[North American Baptist Conference]].\n\nPrairie College now represents one of the most denominationally diversified theological faculties in the [[Council for Christian Colleges and Universities]] CCCU, with an [[Anglican]] priest, a graduate from [[Westminster Theological Seminary]], a [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan]], an [[Anabaptist]] former pastor, and several nondenominational professors.\n\n==Programs==\n\nToday, on its Three Hills campus in Alberta, Prairie Bible Institute operates Prairie College, a post-secondary undergraduate ministry and vocational centre of higher education; further Prairie College maintains active academic arrangements with Bow Valley College of Calgary and Carey Theological College of Vancouver:\n\n*'''Prairie College''' offers resident, commuter and distance education ministry programs with major concentrations in Biblical Studies, Theology, Church Ministries or Intercultural Studies culminating in an A.A.R.S., B.Min., B.Th., B.A., and a concurrent B.A.-M.Div. degree program with [[Taylor College and Seminary|Taylor Seminary]] of Edmonton, Alberta. All students in Prairie's four-year bachelor's degree programs have one year's access to and/or advanced standing in an accredited M.A. or M.Div. seminary degree program from '''Carey Theological College''' of Vancouver, British Columbia.    \n*As well, in each of the four-year bachelor's degree programs of Prairie College the students study the whole Biblical cannon in seven courses (three New Testament segments and four Old Testament segments). \n*Applied vocational programs of Prairie College include Aviation (based at [[Three Hills Airport]]) culminating in an Associate of Arts in Mission Aviation degree. Other Applied Arts and Technology programs are offered by Prairie College which lead to vocational diplomas or Associate of Arts degrees with incorporated provincially recognized diplomas in Digital Media, Emergency Medical Technology, Practical Nursing, Sports Management and other applied disciplines under consideration or development from partnering colleges, most notably [[Bow Valley College]] and [[Olds College]]. Prairie College also confers a four-year Bachelor of Marketplace Ministry which is an interdisciplinary ministry and vocational program of studies.\n\nThe school teaches creation as represented in the [[Book of Genesis]], including the view of Adam and Eve as historical figures.  In order to foster Christian development, most single first- and second-year students, as well as students in full-time flight training live in residence.\n\n==Athletics==\n\nThe Prairie College Pilots are a member of both the [[Alberta Colleges Athletic Conference]] and [[Prairie Athletic Conference]]. The school currently competes in men's and women's basketball, futsal, and volleyball, as well as cross country running and indoor track.\n\nPrairie is a former member of the Alberta Colleges Athletic League.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n\n* [[Don Richardson (missionary)|Don Richardson]]: Missionary and author\n* [[Ralph D.
