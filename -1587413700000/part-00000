The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. By March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. Many individuals temporarily or permanently lost contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, [[financial stimulus]] from governments and charities for artists, have provided greatly differing levels of support, depending on the sector and the country.

The economic impact on the video game sector is not expected to be as large as in film or other entertainment sectors as much of the work in video game production can be decentralised and performed remotely, and products distributed digitally to consumers regardless of various national and regional lockdowns on businesses and services.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://time.com/5793862/coronavirus-video-games/ | title = 'This Is Quite a Blow.'

The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. By March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. Many individuals temporarily or permanently lost contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, [[financial stimulus]] from governments and charities for artists, have provided greatly differing levels of support, depending on the sector and the country.

As cinemas closed, the global [[box office]] dropped by billions of dollars, while streaming became more popular and the [[stock]] of [[Netflix]] rose; the stock of [[film exhibitor]]s dropped dramatically.

As the outbreak and pandemic spread, several keystone trade events, including [[E3 2020]], were cancelled over concerns of further spread. The economic impact on the video game sector is not expected to be as large as in film or other entertainment sectors as much of the work in video game production can be decentralised and performed remotely, and products distributed digitally to consumers regardless of various national and regional lockdowns on businesses and services.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://time.com/5793862/coronavirus-video-games/ | title = 'This Is Quite a Blow.'
