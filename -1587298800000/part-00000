His father was Louis Michael Tobin, (b. 1879) a journalist working at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]]. His father had fought in [[World War I]], was a member of the first [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek]] organization at Illinois ([[Delta Tau Delta]] fraternity Beta Upsilon chapter), and was credited as the inventor of 'Homecoming'. His mother, Margaret Edgerton Tobin (b. 1893), was a social worker. Tobin followed primary school at the [[University Laboratory High School of Urbana, Illinois]], a [[laboratory school]] in the university's campus.\n\nIn 1935, on his father's advice, Tobin took the entrance exams for [[Harvard University]]. Despite no special preparation for the exams, he passed and was admitted with a national scholarship from the university. During his studies he first read [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]]' ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', published in 1936. Tobin graduated ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in 1939 with a thesis centered on a critical analysis of Keynes' mechanism for introducing equilibrium [[involuntary unemployment]]. His first published article, in 1941, was based on this senior's thesis.<ref name=\"solowbio\">{{cite journal |author=Solow Robert |authorlink=Robert Solow |year=2004 |title=James Tobin |url=|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |volume=148 |issue=3}}</ref>\n\nTobin immediately started graduate studies, also at Harvard, earning his [[Master's degree|M.A.]] degree in 1940. In 1941, he interrupted graduate studies to work for the [[Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply]] and the [[War Production Board]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The next year, after the United States entered [[World War II]], he enlisted in the [[US Navy]], spending the war as an officer on a [[destroyer]], including, among possible others, the {{USS|Kearny|DD-432}}.<ref>Reference to USS ''Kearny'' in c. 1965 letter to fellow shipmate Clitus H.

He joined the [[Cowles Foundation]], which moved to Yale in 1955, also serving as its president between 1955\u20131961 and 1964\u20131965. His main research interest was to provide [[microfoundations]] to [[Keynesian economics]], with a special focus on [[monetary economics]]. One of his frequent collaborators was his Yale colleague [[William Brainard]].

During 1961\u201362, he served as a member of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[Council of Economic Advisors]], under the chairman [[Walter Heller]], then acted as a consultant between 1962\u201368. Here, in close collaboration with [[Arthur Okun]], [[Robert Solow]] and [[Kenneth Arrow]], he helped design the Keynesian economic policy implemented by the Kennedy administration.

They had four children: Margaret Ringo (born in 1948), Louis Michael (born in 1951), Hugh Ringo (born in 1953) and Roger Gill (born in 1956).  In late June, 2009, the family announced via a private email that Tobin's wife had died at the age of 90.\n\n===Legacy===\nIn August 2009 in a [[Round table (discussion)|roundtable]] interview in [[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect ''magazine'']], [[Adair Turner]] supported the idea of new global taxes on financial transactions, warning that the \"swollen\" financial sector paying excessive salaries had grown too big for society. Lord Turner's suggestion that a \"[[Tobin tax]]\" \u2013 named after James Tobin \u2013 should be considered for financial transactions made headlines around the world.\n\nTobin's Tobit model of regression with [[Censoring (statistics)|censored endogenous variables]] (Tobin 1958a) is a standard econometric technique.  His [[Tobin's q|\"q\" theory]] of investment (Tobin 1969), the [[Baumol\u2013Tobin model]] of the transactions demand for money (Tobin 1956), and his model of liquidity preference as behavior toward risk (the asset demand for money) (Tobin 1958b) are all staples of economics textbooks.\n\nIn his 1958 article Tobin also led the way in showing how to deal with utility maximization under uncertainty with an infinite number of possible states. As Palda explains \"One way to get out of the mess of figuring out asset prices using a model of maximizing the expected utility of investing in stocks is to make assumptions about either preferences or the probabilities of the different possible states of the world. Nobellist James Tobin (1958) took this line and discovered that in some cases you do not need to worry about the utility of income in thousands of states, and the attached probabilities, to solve the consumer's choice on how to spread income among states. When preferences contain only a linear and a squared term (a case of diminishing returns) or the probabilities of different stock returns follow a normal distribution (an equation that contains a linear and squared terms as parameters), a simple formulation of a person's investment choices becomes possible. Under Tobin's assumptions we can reformulate the person's decision problem as being one of trading off risk and expected return. Risk, or more precisely the variance of your investment portfolio creates spread in the returns you expect. People are willing to assume more risk only if compensated by a higher level of expected return. One can thus think of a tradeoff people are willing to make between risk and expected return. They invest in risky assets to the point at which their willingness to trade off risk and return is equal to the rate at which they able to trade them off. It is difficult to exaggerate how brilliant is the simplification of the investment problem that flows from these assumptions. Instead of worrying about the investor's optimization problem in potentially millions of possible states of the world, one need only worry about how the investor can trade off risk and return in the stock market.\"<ref>Palda, Filip (2013).

His father was Louis Michael Tobin, (b. 1879) a journalist working at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]]. His father had fought in [[World War I]], was a member of the first [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek]] organization at Illinois ([[Delta Tau Delta]] fraternity Beta Upsilon chapter), and was credited as the inventor of 'Homecoming'. His mother, Margaret Edgerton Tobin (b. 1893), was a social worker. Tobin followed primary school at the [[University Laboratory High School of Urbana, Illinois]], a [[laboratory school]] in the university's campus.\n\nIn 1935, on his father's advice, Tobin took the entrance exams for [[Harvard University]]. Despite no special preparation for the exams, he passed and was admitted with a national scholarship from the university. During his studies he first read [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]]' ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', published in 1936. Tobin graduated ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in 1939 with a thesis centered on a critical analysis of Keynes' mechanism for introducing equilibrium [[involuntary unemployment]]. His first published article, in 1941, was based on this senior's thesis.<ref name=\"solowbio\">{{cite journal |author=Solow Robert |authorlink=Robert Solow |year=2004 |title=James Tobin |url=|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |volume=148 |issue=3}}</ref>\n\nTobin immediately started graduate studies, also at Harvard, earning his [[Master's degree|M.A.]] degree in 1940. In 1941, he interrupted graduate studies to work for the [[Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply]] and the [[War Production Board]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The next year, after the United States entered [[World War II]], he enlisted in the [[US Navy]], spending the war as an officer on a [[destroyer]], including, among possible others, the {{USS|Kearny|DD-432}}.<ref>Reference to USS ''Kearny'' in c. 1965 letter to fellow shipmate Clitus H.

He joined the [[Cowles Foundation]], which moved to Yale in 1955, also serving as its president between 1955\u20131961 and 1964\u20131965. His main research interest was to provide [[microfoundations]] to [[Keynesian economics]], with a special focus on [[monetary economics]].

They had four children: Margaret Ringo (born in 1948), Louis Michael (born in 1951), Hugh Ringo (born in 1953) and Roger Gill (born in 1956).  In late June, 2009, the family announced via a private email that Tobin's wife had died at the age of 90.\n\n===Legacy===\nIn August 2009 in a [[Round table (discussion)|roundtable]] interview in [[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect ''magazine'']], [[Adair Turner]] supported the idea of new global taxes on financial transactions, warning that the \"swollen\" financial sector paying excessive salaries had grown too big for society. Lord Turner's suggestion that a \"[[Tobin tax]]\" \u2013 named after James Tobin \u2013 should be considered for financial transactions made headlines around the world.\n\nTobin's Tobit model of regression with [[Censoring (statistics)|censored endogenous variables]] (Tobin 1958a) is a standard econometric technique.  His [[Tobin's q|\"q\" theory]] of investment (Tobin 1969), the [[Baumol\u2013Tobin model]] of the transactions demand for money (Tobin 1956), and his model of liquidity preference as behavior toward risk (the asset demand for money) (Tobin 1958b) are all staples of economics textbooks.\n\nIn his 1958 article Tobin also led the way in showing how to deal with utility maximization under uncertainty with an infinite number of possible states. As Palda explains \"One way to get out of the mess of figuring out asset prices using a model of maximizing the expected utility of investing in stocks is to make assumptions about either preferences or the probabilities of the different possible states of the world. Nobellist James Tobin (1958) took this line and discovered that in some cases you do not need to worry about the utility of income in thousands of states, and the attached probabilities, to solve the consumer's choice on how to spread income among states. When preferences contain only a linear and a squared term (a case of diminishing returns) or the probabilities of different stock returns follow a normal distribution (an equation that contains a linear and squared terms as parameters), a simple formulation of a person's investment choices becomes possible. Under Tobin's assumptions we can reformulate the person's decision problem as being one of trading off risk and expected return. Risk, or more precisely the variance of your investment portfolio creates spread in the returns you expect. People are willing to assume more risk only if compensated by a higher level of expected return. One can thus think of a tradeoff people are willing to make between risk and expected return. They invest in risky assets to the point at which their willingness to trade off risk and return is equal to the rate at which they able to trade them off. It is difficult to exaggerate how brilliant is the simplification of the investment problem that flows from these assumptions. Instead of worrying about the investor's optimization problem in potentially millions of possible states of the world, one need only worry about how the investor can trade off risk and return in the stock market.\"<ref>Palda, Filip (2013).

SIDS is the sudden and unexplained death of a baby under 1 year of age. Even though there is no way to know which babies might die of SIDS, recommendations include:\n\n* Always place the baby on his or her back to sleep, even for naps. This is the safest sleep position for a healthy baby to reduce the risk of SIDS.\n* Place the baby on a firm mattress, such as in a safety-approved crib. Research has shown that placing a baby to sleep on soft mattresses, sofas, sofa cushions, waterbeds, sheepskins, or other soft surfaces raises the risk of SIDS.\n* Remove soft, fluffy, and loose bedding and stuffed toys from the baby's sleep area. Make sure all pillows, quilts, stuffed toys, and other soft items are kept away from the baby's sleep area.\n* Do not use infant sleep positioners. Using a positioner to hold an infant on his or her back or side for sleep is dangerous and not needed.\n* Make sure everyone who cares for the baby knows to place the baby on his or her back to sleep and about the dangers of soft bedding. Talk to child care providers, grandparents, babysitters, and all caregivers about SIDS risk. Remember, every sleep time counts.\n* Make sure the baby's face and head stay uncovered during sleep. Keep blankets and other coverings away from the baby's mouth and nose. The best way to do this is to dress the baby in sleep clothing so there will not have to use any other covering over the baby. If using a blanket or another covering, make sure that the baby's feet are at the bottom of the crib, the blanket is no higher than the baby's chest, and the blanket is tucked in around the bottom of the crib mattress.\n* Do not allow smoking around the baby. Don't smoke before or after the birth of the baby and make sure no one smokes around the baby.\n* Don't let the baby get too warm during sleep. Keep the baby warm during sleep, but not too warm. The baby's room should be at a temperature that is comfortable for an adult. Too many layers of clothing or blankets can overheat the baby.<ref name = NIH2017/>\nSome mothers worry if the baby rolls over during the night. However, by the time the baby is able to roll over by herself, the risk for SIDS is much lower. During the time of greatest risk, 2 to 4 months of age, most babies are not able to turn over from their backs to their stomachs.<ref name = NIH2017/>\n\n==Car seats==\n{{Main | Child safety seat}}\nNewborns and older infants are to use rear-facing car seats. These are required until age 2 or when they reach the upper weight or height limit of that seat. After this, a forward-facing car seat is used.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/features/passengersafety/ingofraphic.html|title=CDC Features - Child Passenger Safety|website=Cdc.gov|accessdate=26 July 2017}}{{PD-notice}}</ref> Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death for children in the US.

While Cesar is showing off to friends his remarkable prowess with the whip, he accidentally clips off the feather [[shako]] on the hat of Don Sebastian ([[Donald Crisp]]) of the Palace Guard. Although Cesar apologizes immediately, Sebastian is unforgiving. Their duel is interrupted by a runaway bull. Trapped on the ground with his sword belt tangled in his boot, certain to be gored by the bull, Sebastian is saved at the last minute by Cesar. This further infuriates him. The action is observed by Queen Isabella ([[Stella De Lanti]]) and her guest, Austrian Archduke Paul ([[Warner Oland]]); she requests Cesar's company immediately. Another friend of Cesar, Don Fabrique Borusta ([[Jean Hersholt]]), offers to bring him to Her Majesty.\n\nMeanwhile, Cesar encounters Dolores ([[Mary Astor]]), daughter of his father's old friend, General de Muro ([[Jack McDonald (actor)|Jack McDonald]]), as she poses for a sculptor. It is love at first sight. But Sebastian, who comes from a poor family, has set his sights on Dolores and her family's wealth, and is determined to win her. Later, the Archduke invites Cesar to paint the town, with Sebastian as their \"duenna.\" In a local tavern the Archduke offends the patrons, all seeming ruffians, by flirting with the dancer. Sebastian contrives his and the Duke's escape, but locks Cesar in the tavern to defend himself against the cutthroats. In the carriage that takes them away from what he is sure will be Cesar's death, Sebastian declares he has a meeting with Dolores. The Archduke invites himself along. While Sebastian asks the General for his daughter's hand, the Archduke sees Dolores serenaded by Cesar, who escaped (easily) and even acquired a guitar as a souvenir. Seeing the reactions of the young couple, the Archduke knows Cesar has won Dolores's heart.\n\nAlthough penniless, Don Fabrique has designs on succeeding in society. He glues together a discarded invitation to the Archduke\u2019s Grand Ball, and crashes the party. At the ball, Cesar and Sebastian sit on either side of Dolores, both seeming frustrated in their efforts to woo her. The Archduke summons her to him. When Cesar sees the Archduke caress Dolores's cheek, Cesar becomes jealous and goes to confront him. But the Archduke assures him that he is working in Cesar's favor, and proves it by dragging Sebastian to another room to play cards while Cesar and Dolores dance together. Cesar pulls Dolores to a balcony for ardent lovemaking. Fabrique sees them; when the pair are interrupted by Dolores\u2019s father, General de Muro, who recognizes Cesar and is ready to give his blessing, Fabrique believes they are about to be betrothed.\n\nIn the card room, the Archduke declares that Sebastian is as unlucky at cards as he is in love. Franque tiptoes in, and tells the Archduke that he saw Cesar and Dolores kissing: surely they will be married now. The Archduke summons Cesar to congratulate him, to the horror of Sebastian. When he enters, Cesar is offended at the impropriety of this news, and learns that the source was Fabrique. Such bad manners should not go unpunished. He informs the Archduke that someone here doesn't belong, and asks if he should remove him. Archduke Paul nods, and Cesar pulls Fabrique out of the room by tugging his nose.\n\nThe Archduke continues to taunt Sebastian, a foolish move when Sebastian, enraged by jealousy, pulls his sword and stabs the Archduke before he realizes what he has done. He hides when Cesar, hearing something, enters, then strikes Cesar unconscious. He frames him for the Archduke's murder, then casually leaves. With his last dying energy, the Archduke pulls a playing card off the table and writes on it: Sebastian assassinated me. Archduke Paul.\n\nFabrique enters, finds Cesar unconscious, finds the playing card and, miffed at Cesar's insult, takes it. Shortly thereafter he confronts Sebastian with his demands: to be appointed Civil Governor. Both stand by while the Guard arrests Cesar for the murder and orders his immediate execution to prevent an international incident. But General de Muro offers Cesar a gentleman\u2019s way out by giving him a dagger. Cesar pretends to stab himself and falls to the moat below the castle.\n\nMonths pass, while Cesar hides in the ruins of the old family castle. He pretends to be Don Q, for \"a trick must be answered by a trick!\" Fabrique has become Civil Governor, receiving regular pay-offs from Sebastian. Fabrique has even taken over Carlo's servants, and maidservant Lola ([[Lottie Pickford]]), seeing how Sebastian behaves around Fabrique, runs to tell Cesar that although gossip says they are close friends, in truth Sebastian is afraid of Fabrique. This will prove the leverage Cesar needs to establish his innocence.\n\nAfter months of mourning over Cesar, Dolores is pushed to marry Sebastian. Just as she is about to sign the marriage contract with Sebastian, Cesar appears at the window. He is alive! The Queen orders Cesar\u2019s arrest. The best man to find him: that one-eyed ferret, Colonel Matsado ([[Albert MacQuarrie]]). But when Matsado stops at a country inn on his way into the city, Cesar waylays him, steals his uniform, and impersonates him. Back in the city Cesar as Matsado pretends to beat his (now Fabrique's) old manservant Robledo ([[Charles Stevens (actor)|Charles Stevens]]) for information on Cesar's whereabouts, then convinces Fabrique to accompany him to the ruins  where Cesar has been living these past months. There he is determined to find what hold Fabrique has on Sebastian.\n\nIn a whirlwind finish, Sebastian and the real Matsado track Cesar to his lair, as do his father, Zorro (Fairbanks), who with the mute faithful family servant Bernardo ([[Tote Du Crow]]), has sailed from California to Spain to help.

While Cesar is showing off to friends his remarkable prowess with the whip, he accidentally clips off the feather [[shako]] on the hat of Don Sebastian ([[Donald Crisp]]) of the Palace Guard. Although Cesar apologizes immediately, Sebastian is unforgiving. Their duel is interrupted by a runaway bull. Trapped on the ground with his sword belt tangled in his boot, certain to be gored by the bull, Sebastian is saved at the last minute by Cesar. This further infuriates him. The action is observed by Queen Isabella ([[Stella De Lanti]]) and her guest, Austrian Archduke Paul ([[Warner Oland]]); she requests Cesar's company immediately. Another friend of Cesar, Don Fabrique Borusta ([[Jean Hersholt]]), offers to bring him to Her Majesty.\n\nMeanwhile, Cesar encounters Dolores ([[Mary Astor]]), daughter of his father's old friend, General de Muro ([[Jack McDonald (actor)|Jack McDonald]]), as she poses for a sculptor. It is love at first sight. But Sebastian, who comes from a poor family, has set his sights on Dolores and her family's wealth, and is determined to win her. Later, the Archduke invites Cesar to paint the town, with Sebastian as their \"duenna.\" In a local tavern the Archduke offends the patrons, all seeming ruffians, by flirting with the dancer. Sebastian contrives his and the Duke's escape, but locks Cesar in the tavern to defend himself against the cutthroats. In the carriage that takes them away from what he is sure will be Cesar's death, Sebastian declares he has a meeting with Dolores. The Archduke invites himself along. While Sebastian asks the General for his daughter's hand, the Archduke sees Dolores serenaded by Cesar, who escaped (easily) and even acquired a guitar as a souvenir. Seeing the reactions of the young couple, the Archduke knows Cesar has won Dolores's heart.\n\nAlthough penniless, Don Fabrique has designs on succeeding in society. He glues together a discarded invitation to the Archduke\u2019s Grand Ball, and crashes the party. At the ball, Cesar and Sebastian sit on either side of Dolores, both seeming frustrated in their efforts to woo her. The Archduke summons her to him. When Cesar sees the Archduke caress Dolores's cheek, Cesar becomes jealous and goes to confront him. But the Archduke assures him that he is working in Cesar's favor, and proves it by dragging Sebastian to another room to play cards while Cesar and Dolores dance together. Cesar pulls Dolores to a balcony for ardent lovemaking. Fabrique sees them; when the pair are interrupted by Dolores\u2019s father, General de Muro, who recognizes Cesar and is ready to give his blessing, Fabrique believes they are about to be betrothed.\n\nIn the card room, the Archduke declares that Sebastian is as unlucky at cards as he is in love. Franque tiptoes in, and tells the Archduke that he saw Cesar and Dolores kissing: surely they will be married now. The Archduke summons Cesar to congratulate him, to the horror of Sebastian. When he enters, Cesar is offended at the impropriety of this news, and learns that the source was Fabrique. Such bad manners should not go unpunished. He informs the Archduke that someone here doesn't belong, and asks if he should remove him. Archduke Paul nods, and Cesar pulls Fabrique out of the room by tugging his nose.\n\nThe Archduke continues to taunt Sebastian, a foolish move when Sebastian, enraged by jealousy, pulls his sword and stabs the Archduke before he realizes what he has done. He hides when Cesar, hearing something, enters, then strikes Cesar unconscious. He frames him for the Archduke's murder, then casually leaves. With his last dying energy, the Archduke pulls a playing card off the table and writes on it: Sebastian assassinated me. Archduke Paul.\n\nFabrique enters, finds Cesar unconscious, finds the playing card and, miffed at Cesar's insult, takes it. Shortly thereafter he confronts Sebastian with his demands: to be appointed Civil Governor. Both stand by while the Guard arrests Cesar for the murder and orders his immediate execution to prevent an international incident. But General de Muro offers Cesar a gentleman\u2019s way out by giving him a dagger. Cesar pretends to stab himself and falls to the moat below the castle.\n\nMonths pass, while Cesar hides in the ruins of the old family castle. He pretends to be Don Q, for \"a trick must be answered by a trick!\" Fabrique has become Civil Governor, receiving regular pay-offs from Sebastian. Fabrique has even taken over Carlo's servants, and maidservant Lola ([[Lottie Pickford]]), seeing how Sebastian behaves around Fabrique, runs to tell Cesar that although gossip says they are close friends, in truth Sebastian is afraid of Fabrique. This will prove the leverage Cesar needs to establish his innocence.\n\nAfter months of mourning over Cesar, Dolores is pushed to marry Sebastian. Just as she is about to sign the marriage contract with Sebastian, Cesar appears at the window. He is alive! The Queen orders Cesar\u2019s arrest. The best man to find him: that one-eyed ferret, Colonel Matsado ([[Albert MacQuarrie]]). But when Matsado stops at a country inn on his way into the city, Cesar waylays him, steals his uniform, and impersonates him. Back in the city Cesar as Matsado pretends to beat his (now Fabrique's) old manservant Robledo ([[Charles Stevens (actor)|Charles Stevens]]) for information on Cesar's whereabouts, then convinces Fabrique to accompany him to the ruins  where Cesar has been living these past months. There he is determined to find what hold Fabrique has on Sebastian.\n\nIn a whirlwind finish, Sebastian and the real Matsado track Cesar to his lair, as do his father, Zorro (Fairbanks), who with the mute faithful family servant Bernardo ([[Tote Du Crow]]), has sailed from California to Spain to help. On the way to the ruins they pass Dolores and her mother along the same road. Finally, as all gather at the ruins, Zorro and Don Q battle the soldiers, Fabrique confesses, Sebastian is beaten, de Muro recognizes his old friend, the villains are arrested, and Cesar and Dolores reunited.\n\n==DVD release==\n''Don Q, Son of Zorro'' has been released by [[Kino International (company)|Kino Video]] on [[DVD region code|Region 1]] [[DVD]] twice: first in a double-bill edition with the 1920 ''The Mark of Zorro''<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.kinolorber.com/film/themarkofzorrodonqsonofzorro |title=Kino Lorber - The Mark of Zorro/Don Q, Son of Zorro |accessdate=2018-04-12}}</ref> and then as part of the 2004 ''Douglas Fairbanks Collection''.

While film heroines also sang and danced, it was the vamp who wore more revealing clothes, smoked, drank, and sang sexually suggestive lyrics.<ref name=\"Communalism\"/> The vamp was portrayed as immodest rather than evil, and her dance performances were sexualized by male producers. The trend was started by [[Cuckoo Moray|Cuckoo]] in films like ''[[Awaara]]'' (1951), ''[[Aan]]'' (1952) and ''Shabistan'' (1951).<ref name=\"filmonomics\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pixelonomics.com/bollywood-item-numbers-monica-to-munni/|title=Bollywood item numbers: from Monica to Munni|year=2010|accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref>\n[[File:Priya Soni dancing at Dubai Dazzle show.jpg|thumb|Item girl Priya Soni dancing for a film]]\n\nItem numbers had been featured in Bollywood from as early as the 1930s. Azoorie in the 1930s often performed item numbers; Cuckoo was the next popular item dancer in the late 40s. Her banner year was 1949 when she was featured in over 17 films performing dances. Actress and classical dancer [[Vyjayanthimala]] was the one that introduced the classical dance number in Hindi films with her debut film ''[[Bahar (film)|Bahar]]'' (1951). The mixture of classical plus contemporary was popularized by Vyjayanthimala in films such as [[Devdas (1955 film)|''Devdas'']] (1955), [[Amrapali (film)|''Amrapali'']] (1966), ''[[Madhumati]]'' (1958), [[Sadhna (1958 film)|''Sadhna'']] (1958), [[Sunghursh]] (1968) etc.\n\nIn the early 50s, Cuckoo introduced the Anglo-Burmese [[Helen (actress)|Helen]] as a chorus girl. In time Helen would come to be the most popular vamp of the late-50s, 60s and 70s,<ref name=\"Global Bollywood\">{{cite book|last=Anandam P|first=Kavoori|title=Global Bollywood|year=2008|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=0-8147-4799-X|page=187}}</ref> having had performed in scores of item numbers including such popular songs as \"[[Mera Naam Chin Chin Choo]]\" from the film ''[[Howrah Bridge (film)|Howrah Bridge]]'' (1958), \"[[Piya Tu Ab To Aaja]]\" from ''[[Caravan (1971 film)|Caravan]]'' (1971), \"Mehbooba Mehbooba\" from ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975) and \"Yeh Mera Dil\" from ''[[Don (1978 film)|Don]] '' (1978). The song's tune was also used in [[Don't Phunk with My Heart|Don't Phunk With My Heart]], \"O Haseena Zulfon Wali\" from [[Teesri Manzil]] and \"[[Aa Jaane Jaan]]\". In films like ''[[Gunga Jumna]]'' and ''[[Zindagi (1964 film)|Zindagi]]'' the actor performed semi-classical Indian dances in songs like \"Tora man bada paapi\" and \"Ghungarwa mora chham chham baaje\". A ''[[desi]]'' bar number, \"Mungda\" from ''[[Inkaar (1977 film)|Inkaar]]'' was also immensely popular. In addition to her skillful dancing, her anglicised looks too helped further the vamp image.<ref name=\"revamp\">{{cite news|last=Mukherjee|first=Madhurita|title=Revamping Bollywood's sexy vamps |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2003-02-03/news-interviews/27281535_1_cinema-special-appearance-shamita-shetty|accessdate=12 November 2010|newspaper=Times of India|date=3 February 2003}}</ref> Helen's dominance pushed other vying item number dancers like Madhumati, [[Bela Bose]], [[Laxmi Chhaya]], Jeevankala, [[Aruna Irani]], Sheela R. and Sujata Bakshi into the background and less prestigious and low budget b-movies.\n\nIn the early part of the 1970s actresses [[Jayshree T.]], [[Bindu (actress)|Bindu]], [[Aruna Irani]] and [[Padma Khanna]] entered into what was Helen's monopoly. Another noted feature of this era was the \"tribal and ''banjara''\" item numbers such as the one in the [[Dharmendra]], Zeenat Aman and [[Rex Harrison]] starer ''[[Shalimar (1978 film)|Shalimar]]''.

While film heroines also sang and danced, it was the vamp who wore more revealing clothes, smoked, drank, and sang sexually suggestive lyrics.<ref name=\"Communalism\"/> The vamp was portrayed as immodest rather than evil, and her dance performances were sexualized by male producers.

Actress and classical dancer [[Vyjayanthimala]] was the one that introduced the classical dance number in Hindi films with her debut film ''[[Bahar (film)|Bahar]]'' (1951). The mixture of classical plus contemporary was popularized by Vyjayanthimala in films such as [[Devdas (1955 film)|''Devdas'']] (1955), [[Amrapali (film)|''Amrapali'']] (1966), ''[[Madhumati]]'' (1958), [[Sadhna (1958 film)|''Sadhna'']] (1958), [[Sunghursh]] (1968) etc.\n\nIn the early 50s, Cuckoo introduced the Anglo-Burmese [[Helen (actress)|Helen]] as a chorus girl.

The song's tune was also used in [[Don't Phunk with My Heart|Don't Phunk With My Heart]], \"O Haseena Zulfon Wali\" from [[Teesri Manzil]] and \"[[Aa Jaane Jaan]]\". In films like ''[[Gunga Jumna]]'' and ''[[Zindagi (1964 film)|Zindagi]]'' the actor performed semi-classical Indian dances in songs like \"Tora man bada paapi\" and \"Ghungarwa mora chham chham baaje\".

It was suggested by [[James Tobin]], an economist who won the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]]. Tobin's tax was originally intended to penalize short-term financial round-trip excursions into another currency.  By the late 1990s, the term Tobin tax was being incorrectly used to apply to all forms of short term transaction taxation, whether across currencies or not. Another term for these broader tax schemes is [[Robin Hood tax]], due to tax revenues from the (presumably richer) speculator funding general revenue (of whom the primary beneficiaries are less wealthy).  More exact terms, however, apply to different scopes of tax.\n{{TOCLimit|3}}\n\n== Tobin's original proposal ==\n\nTobin suggested his [[currency transaction tax]] in 1972 in his Janeway Lectures at [[Princeton University|Princeton]], shortly after the [[Bretton Woods system]] of [[money|monetary]] management ended in 1971.<ref name=\"Tobin\">{{cite journal |url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/eej/eeconj/v4y1978i3-4p153-159.html |title=A Proposal for International Monetary Reform |author=James Tobin |date=July\u2013October 1978 |journal=Eastern Economic Journal|volume=4 |issue=3\u20134 |pages=153\u2013159|accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref> Prior to 1971, one of the chief features of the Bretton Woods system was an obligation for each country to adopt a [[monetary policy]] that maintained the [[exchange rate]] of its currency within a fixed value\u2014plus or minus one percent\u2014in terms of [[gold]]. Then, on August 15, 1971, United States President [[Richard Nixon]] announced that the [[United States dollar]] would no longer be [[convertibility|convertible to gold]], effectively ending the system. This action created the situation whereby the U.S. dollar became the sole backing of currencies and a [[reserve currency]] for the member states of the Bretton Woods system, leading the system to collapse in the face of increasing financial strain in that same year. In that context, Tobin suggested a new system for international currency stability, and proposed that such a system include an international charge on [[Foreign exchange market|foreign-exchange]] transactions.\n\nIn 2001, in another context, just after \"the nineties' [[liquidity crisis|crises]] in Mexico, Southeast Asia and Russia,\"<ref name=\"ex\">Excerpt from original German article: \"wie die Krisen in Mexiko, S\u00fcdostasien und Russland w\u00e4hrend der neunziger Jahre gezeigt haben.

This dissuades [[speculator]]s as many investors invest their money in foreign exchange on a very short-term basis. If this money is suddenly withdrawn, countries have to drastically increase [[interest rate]]s for their currency to still be attractive.

Accordingly, most debate on the issue has shifted towards a general [[financial transaction tax]] which would capture such proxies.  Other measures to avoid punishing hedging (a form of insurance for cashflows) were also proposed.  By the 2010s the [[Basel II]] and [[Basel III]] frameworks required reporting that would help to differentiate them.<ref name=\"keydifferences.com\">{{cite web|url=http://keydifferences.com/difference-between-hedging-and-speculation.html|title=Difference Between Hedging and Speculation (with Comparison Chart) - Key Differences|date=6 January 2016|publisher=}}</ref> and economic thought was tending to reject the belief that they could not be differentiated, or (as the \"Chicago School\" had held) should not be.\n\n== Recent proposals ==\n\nIn March 2016 [[China]] drafted rules to impose a genuine [[currency transaction tax]] and this was referred to in financial press as a '''Tobin tax''' [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-15/china-said-to-draft-rules-for-tobin-tax-on-currency-transactions].  This was widely viewed as a warning to curb shorting of its currency the [[Renminbi|yuan]].  It was however expected to keep this tax at 0% initially, calculating potential revenue from different rate schemes and exemptions, and not to impose the actual tax unless speculation increased.\n\nAlso in 2016 [[US Democratic Party]] [[POTUS]] nominee [[Hillary Clinton]] included in her platform a vow to \"Impose a tax on high-frequency trading. The growth of high-frequency trading has unnecessarily placed stress on our markets, created instability, and enabled unfair and abusive trading strategies. Hillary would impose a tax on harmful high-frequency trading and reform rules to make our stock markets fairer, more open, and transparent.\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/wall-street/|title=Hillary Clinton on Wall Street reform|publisher=}}</ref> However, the term \"high-frequency\" implied that only a few large volume transaction players engaged in [[arbitrage]] would likely be affected. Clinton referred separately to \"Impose a risk fee on the largest financial institutions. Big banks and financial companies would be required to pay a fee based on their size and their risk of contributing to another crisis.\" The calculations of such fees would necessarily depend on [[financial risk management]] criteria (see [[Basel II]] and [[Basel III]]). Because of its restriction to so-called \"harmful high-frequency trading\" rather than to inter-currency transactions, neither of Clinton's proposals could be considered a true '''Tobin tax''' though international exposure would be a factor in the \"risk fee\".\n\n==Concepts and definitions==\n\n=== hedging vs. speculation ===\n\nCritics of all [[financial transaction tax]]es and [[currency transaction tax]]es emphasize the [[financial risk management]] difficulty of differentiating [[hedge (finance)|hedging]] from [[speculation]],<ref name=\"books.google.ca\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EsaCMRHILb8C&pg=PA196&lpg=PA196&dq=differentiate%20speculation%20from%20hedging%20tax#v=onepage&q=differentiate%20speculation%20from%20hedging%20tax&f=false|title=Europe's Monetary Future|last=Collignon|first=Stefan|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=9780838636060|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>http://validusrm.com/news/hedging-and-speculation-two-sides-of-the-same-coin/</ref> and the economic argument (attributed to the \"Chicago School\") that they cannot in principle be differentiated.  However, advocates of such taxes considered these problems manageable, especially in context of broader [[financial transaction tax]].<ref name=\"globalpolicy.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.globalpolicy.org/social-and-economic-policy/global-taxes-1-79/currency-transaction-taxes/45990-destabilizing-speculation-and-the-case-for-an-international-currency-transactions-tax.html|title=Destabilizing Speculation and the Case for an International Currency Transactions Tax|last=Administrator|publisher=}}</ref>   Briefly, the differences are:<ref name=\"keydifferences.com\"/> \n*hedging protects an existing investment against unforeseen price changes, while speculation takes on additional risk the investor could have avoided\n*hedging is a means to manage or limit price risk, while speculation actually relies on taking a risk for profit (and is in this respect similar to [[gambling]])\n*hedging protects against price changes and makes them less relevant to the overall price of outputs sold to the public, while speculation incurs risk to make a profit specifically from price volatility\n*hedging is a form of insurance for risk averse investors, speculation is for those seeking more rapid returns through higher risk\n\n===Tobin's concept===\nJames Tobin's purpose in developing his idea of a [[currency transaction tax]] was to find a way to manage exchange-rate volatility. In his view, \"currency exchanges transmit disturbances originating in international financial markets. National economies and national governments are not capable of adjusting to massive movements of funds across the foreign exchanges, without real hardship and without significant sacrifice of the objectives of national economic policy with respect to employment, output, and inflation.\"<ref name=\"Tobin\"/>\n\nTobin saw two solutions to this issue. The first was to move \"toward a common currency, common monetary and fiscal policy, and economic integration.\"<ref name=\"Tobin\"/> The second was to move \"toward greater financial segmentation between nations or currency areas, permitting their central banks and governments greater autonomy in policies tailored to their specific economic institutions and objectives.\"<ref name=\"Tobin\"/> Tobin's preferred solution was the former one but he did not see this as politically viable so he advocated for the latter approach: \"I therefore regretfully recommend the second, and my proposal is to throw some sand in the wheels of our excessively efficient international money markets.\"<ref name=\"Tobin\"/>\n\nTobin's method of \"throwing sand in the wheels\" was to suggest a tax on all spot conversions of one currency into another, proportional to the size of the transaction.<ref name=\"Tobin\"/> In the development of his idea, Tobin was influenced by the earlier work of [[John Maynard Keynes]] on general financial transaction taxes.<ref name=\"Jubilee-trans\"/><ref name=\"Reiermann\"/>\n\nKeynes' concept stems from 1936 when he proposed that a [[Financial transaction tax|transaction tax]] should be levied on dealings on [[Wall Street]], where he argued that excessive speculation by uninformed financial traders increased volatility. For Keynes (who [[John Maynard Keynes#Personal life|was himself a speculator]]) the key issue was the proportion of 'speculators' in the market, and his concern that, if left unchecked, these types of players would become too dominant.<ref name=\"Keynes\">{{cite web |url=http://biblioeconomicus.googlepages.com/KeynesJohnMaynard-TheGeneralTheoryOfEmploymentInterestAndMoney.pdf  |title=The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money | pages =104, 105 (Chapter 12, Part VI)|author=John Maynard Keynes |year=1936}} (Online publisher: Project Gutenberg of Australia eBooks; via biblioeconomicus.googlepages.com)</ref>\n\n===Variations on Tobin tax idea ===\n\nThe most common variations on Tobin's idea are a general [[currency transaction tax]], a more general [[financial transaction tax]] and (the most general) [[Robin Hood tax]] on transactions only richer investors can afford to engage in.\n\n==== Pollin and Baker ====\n\nA key issue with Tobin's tax was \"avoidance by change of product mix... market participants would have an incentive to substitute out of financial instruments subject to the tax and into instruments not subject to it. In this fashion, markets would innovate so as to avoid the tax... [so] focusing on just spot currency markets would clearly induce a huge shifting of transactions into futures and derivatives markets. Thus, the real issue is how to design a tax that takes account of all the methods and margins of substitution that investors have for changing their patterns of activity to avoid the tax. Taking account of these considerations implies a '''Tobin tax''' that is bigger in scope, and pushes the design toward a generalized [[securities transaction tax]] that resembles the tax suggested by Pollin et al. (1999). There are four benefits to this. First, it is likely to generate significantly greater revenues. Second, it maintains a level playing field across financial markets so that no individual financial instrument is arbitrarily put at a competitive disadvantage versus another. Third, it is likely to enhance domestic financial market stability by discouraging domestic asset speculation. Fourth, to the extent that advanced economies already put too many real resources into financial dealings, it would cut back on this resource use, freeing these resources for other productive uses [Fourth] such substitution is costly both in resource use, and because alternative instruments do not provide exactly the same services [thus] just as the market provides an incentive to avoid a Tobin tax, so too it automatically sets in motion forces that deter excessive avoidance.\" - Palley, 2000 <ref name=\"globalpolicy.org\"/>\n\t \nPollin, Palley and Baker (2000) <ref>Baker, D., \"The Case for a Unilateral Speculation Tax in the United State,\" Briefing Paper, Center for Economic and Policy Research, Washington DC 20036, 2000.</ref> emphasize that transaction taxes \"have clearly not prevented the efficient functioning of these markets. \"\n\n====The Spahn tax====\n{{Main|Spahn tax}}\n\nAccording to [[Paul Bernd Spahn]] in 1995, \"Analysis has shown that the Tobin tax as originally proposed is not viable and should be laid aside for good.\"<ref name = \"Spahn\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de/profs/spahn/pdf/publ/7-041.pdf |title=International Financial Flows and Transactions Taxes: Survey and Options |author=Paul Bernd Spahn |date= June 16, 1995|website= |publisher= University of Frankfurt/Main; Paper originally published with the [[International Monetary Fund]] as Working Paper WP/95/60.|accessdate=2010-01-13|author-link=Paul Bernd Spahn }}</ref>\n\n====Special drawing rights====\nOn September 19, 2001, retired speculator [[George Soros]] put forward a proposal based on the [[IMF]]'s existing [[special drawing rights]] (SDRs) mechanism.  In Soros' scheme, rich countries would pledge SDRs (which are denominated as a basket of multiple 'hard' currencies) for the purpose of providing international assistance.  Soros was not necessarily dismissing the Tobin tax idea.  He stated, \"I think there is a case for a Tobin tax ... (but) it is not at all clear to me that a Tobin tax would reduce volatility in the currency markets.

Many people have therefore argued that it would be best implemented by an international institution.  It has been proposed that having the [[United Nations]] manage a Tobin tax would solve this problem and would give the UN a large source of funding independent from donations by participating states. However, there have also been initiatives of national dimension about the tax. (This is in addition to the [[Foreign exchange controls|many countries that have foreign exchange controls]].)\n\nWhilst finding some support in countries with strong left-wing political movements such as France and [[Latin America]], the Tobin tax proposal came under much criticism from economists and governments, especially those with liberal markets and a large international banking sector, who said it would be impossible to implement and would destabilise foreign exchange markets.\n\nMost of the actual implementation of Tobin taxes, whether in the form of a specific [[currency transaction tax]], or a more general [[financial transaction tax]], has occurred at a national level.

Thus a round trip (purchase and sale) transaction resulted in a 1% tax.  In July 1986 the rate was doubled. In January 1989, a considerably lower tax of 0.002% on fixed-income securities was introduced for a security with a maturity of 90 days or less. On a bond with a maturity of five years or more, the tax was 0.003%.\n\nThe revenues from taxes were disappointing; for example, revenues from the tax on fixed-income securities were initially expected to amount to 1,500 million Swedish kronor per year. They did not amount to more than 80 million Swedish kronor in any year and the average was closer to 50 million.<ref name=\"papers.ssrn.com\">{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=John Y.|last2=Froot|first2=Kenneth A.|date=December 1993|title=International Experiences with Securities Transaction Taxes (NBER Working Paper No. W4587)|ssrn=338864}}</ref> In addition, as taxable trading volumes fell, so did revenues from capital gains taxes, entirely offsetting revenues from the equity transactions tax that had grown to 4,000 million Swedish kronor by 1988.<ref name=\"ideas.repec.org\">{{cite journal|last1=Umlauf|first1=S|year=1993|title=Transaction taxes and the behavior of the Swedish stock market|journal=Journal of Financial Economics|volume=33|issue=2|page=227|doi=10.1016/0304-405X(93)90005-V}}</ref>\n\nOn the day that the tax was announced, share prices fell by 2.2%. But there was leakage of information prior to the announcement, which might explain the 5.35% price decline in the 30 days prior to the announcement. When the tax was doubled, prices again fell by another 1%. These declines were in line with the capitalized value of future tax payments resulting from expected trades. It was further felt that the taxes on fixed-income securities only served to increase the cost of government borrowing, providing another argument against the tax.\n\nEven though the tax on fixed-income securities was much lower than that on equities, the impact on market trading was much more dramatic. During the first week of the tax, the volume of bond trading fell by 85%, even though the tax rate on five-year bonds was only 0.003%. The volume of futures trading fell by 98% and the options trading market disappeared.   On 15 April 1990, the tax on fixed-income securities was abolished. In January 1991 the rates on the remaining taxes were cut in half and by the end of the year they were abolished completely.  Once the taxes were eliminated, trading volumes returned and grew substantially in the 1990s and 2000s.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hemmelgarn|first=Thomas|last2=Nicodeme|first2=Gaetan|date=2012-02-23|title=Can Tax Policy Help to Prevent Financial Crisis?|language=en-US|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199698165.001.0001|isbn=9780199698165|url=http://fdslive.oup.com/www.oup.com/academic/pdf/openaccess/9780199698165.pdf|hdl=10419/118674}}</ref>\n\n====Tobin tax proponents reaction to the Swedish experience====\nThe Swedish experience of a transaction tax was with purchase or sale of equity securities, fixed income securities and derivatives.

To investigate the feasibility of such a tax they hired the [[City of London]] firm Intelligence Capital, who found that a tax on the [[pound sterling]] wherever it was traded in the world, as opposed to a tax on all currencies traded in the UK, was indeed feasible and could be unilaterally implemented by the UK government.<ref name=\"Spratt\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stampoutpoverty.org/?lid=9889|title=A Sterling Solution|author=Stephen Spratt|date=September 2006|work=Stamp Out Poverty report|publisher=Stamp Out Poverty Campaign}}</ref>\n\nThe Sterling Stamp Duty, as it became known, was to be set at a rate 200 times lower than Tobin had envisaged in 2001, which \"pro Tobin tax\" supporters claim wouldn't have affected currency markets and could still raise large sums of money.

In December, 1997 [[Ignacio Ramonet]], editor of ''[[Le Monde Diplomatique]]'', renewed the debate around the Tobin tax with an editorial titled [http://mondediplo.com/1997/12/leader \"Disarming the markets\"]. Ramonet proposed to create an association for the introduction of this tax, which was named [[ATTAC]] (Association for the Taxation of financial Transactions for the Aid of Citizens). The tax then became an issue of the [[global justice movement]] or [[alter-globalization]] movement and a matter of discussion not only in academic institutions but even in streets and in parliaments in the UK, France, and around the world.\n\nIn an interview<ref>http://www.vita.it/news/view/3853{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> given to the Italian independent radio network [[Radio Popolare]] in July 2001 James Tobin distanced himself from the [[global justice movement]]. \u00ab''There are agencies and groups in Europe that have used the Tobin Tax as an issue of broader campaigns, for reasons that go far beyond my proposal.

He declared himself not contrary to this use of the tax's income, but stressed that it was not the important aspect of the tax.\n\nATTAC and other organizations have recognized that while they still consider Tobin's original aim as paramount, they think the tax could produce funds for development needs in the South (such as the [[Millennium Development Goals]]),<ref name=\"Spratt\" /> and allow governments, and therefore citizens, to reclaim part of the democratic space conceded to the financial markets.\n\nIn March, 2002, [[London School of Economics]] Professor Willem Buiter, who studied under James Tobin, wrote an obituary for the man,<ref>http://www.nber.org/~wbuiter/obit.pdf</ref> but also remarked that, \"This [Tobin Tax] ... was in recent years adopted by some of the most determined enemies of trade liberalisation, globalisation and the open society.\"  Buiter added, \"The proposal to use the Tobin tax as a means of raising revenues for development assistance was rejected by Tobin, and he forcefully repudiated the anti-globalisation mantra of the Seattle crowd.\" In September 2009, Buiter also wrote in the ''[[Financial Times]]'', \"Tobin was a genius ... but the Tobin tax was probably his one daft idea\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/76e13a4e-9725-11de-83c5-00144feabdc0.html?nclick_check=1|title=Forget Tobin tax: there is a better way to curb finance|last=Buiter|first=Willem|date=1 September 2009|publisher=|via=Financial Times}}</ref>\n\nIn those same \"years\" that Buiter spoke of, the Tobin tax was also \"adopted\" or supported in varying degrees by the people who were not, as he put it, \"enemies of trade liberalisation.\"  Among them were [[#From 1990 to 1999|several supporters from 1990 to 1999, including Larry Summers]] and [[#From 2000 to 2004|several from 2000 to 2004, including lukewarm support from George Soros]].\n\n==Evaluating the Tobin tax as a Currency Transaction Tax (CTT)==\n{{See also|Currency transaction tax|#Evaluating the Tobin tax as a general Financial Transaction Tax (FTT)}}\n\n===Stability, volatility and speculation===\n\n====The appeal of stability to many players in the world economy====\nIn 1972, Tobin examined the global monetary system that remained after the Bretton Woods monetary system was abandoned.

They raise interest rates to extraordinary levels to protect investors against currency losses, only to topple their economies and the source of investor profits. ...

Others have tried to be more precise or practical in their search for the Tobin tax rate.\n\nAccording to Garber (1996), competitive pressure on transaction costs ([[Bid\u2013ask spread|spreads]]) in currency markets has reduced these costs to fractions of a [[basis point]]. For example, the EUR.USD [[currency pair]] trades with spreads as tight as 1/10 of a basis point, i.e. with just a 0.00001 difference between the [[Bid\u2013ask spread|bid and offer]] price, so \"a tax on transactions in foreign exchange markets imposed unilaterally, 6/1000 of a basis point (or 0.00006%) is a realistic maximum magnitude.\"<ref>Garber, Peter M.

A CTT tax rate designed with a pragmatic goal of raising revenue for various development projects, rather than to fulfill Tobin's original goals (of \"slowing the flow of capital across borders\" and \"preventing or managing exchange rate crises\"), should avoid altering the existing \"fundamental market behavior\", and thus, according to Schmidt, must not exceed 0.00005, i.e., the observed levels of currency [[transaction cost]]s (bid-ask spreads).<ref name=\"Schmidt-10\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/images/pdfs/10rate.pdf|title=The Currency Transaction Tax: Rate and Revenue Estimates|author=Schmidt, Rodney|date=October 2007|website=|publisher=[[The North-South Institute]]|accessdate=9 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe mathematician [[Paul Wilmott]] has pointed out that while perhaps some trading ought to be discouraged, trading for the hedging of derivatives is generally considered a good thing in that it can reduce risk, and this should not be punished.

Such volume-neutral CTT tax would raise ''relatively little revenue'' though, estimated at around $33 bn annually, i.e., an order of magnitude less than the \"[[carbon tax]] [which] has by far the greatest revenue-raising potential, estimated at $130-750 bn annually.\" The author warns however that both these market-based revenue estimates \"are necessarily [[Speculation|speculative]]\", and he has more confidence in the revenue-raising potential of \"The [[International Finance Facility]] (IFF) and International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm).\"<ref name=\"Schmidt-10\"/>\n\n===Is the tax easy to avoid?===\n\n====Technical feasibility====\nAlthough Tobin had said his own tax idea was unfeasible in practice, [[Joseph Stiglitz]], former Senior Vice President and [[World Bank Chief Economist|Chief Economist]] of the [[World Bank]], said, on October 5, 2009, that modern technology meant that was no longer the case.

Agreement [to implement the tax] by [just three cities,] London, New York and Tokyo alone, would capture 58 per cent of speculative trading.\"<ref name=\"Round\" />\n\n==Evaluating the Tobin tax as a general Financial Transaction Tax (FTT)==\n{{See also|Financial transaction tax|Let Wall Street Pay for the Restoration of Main Street Bill}}\n\n===Sweden's experience in implementing Tobin taxes in the form of general financial transaction taxes===\nIn July, 2006, analyst Marion G. Wrobel examined the actual international experiences of various countries in implementing financial transaction taxes.<ref name=\"lessons\"/>  Wrobel's paper highlighted the Swedish experience with financial transaction taxes.  In January 1984, Sweden introduced a 0.5% tax on the purchase or sale of an equity security. Thus a round trip (purchase and sale) transaction resulted in a 1% tax.  In July 1986 the rate was doubled. In January 1989, a considerably lower tax of 0.002% on [[fixed income]] securities was introduced for a security with a maturity of 90 days or less. On a bond with a maturity of five years or more, the tax was 0.003%.\n\nThe revenues from taxes were disappointing; for example, revenues from the tax on fixed-income securities were initially expected to amount to 1,500 million Swedish kronor per year. They did not amount to more than 80 million Swedish kronor in any year and the average was closer to 50 million.<ref name=\"papers.ssrn.com\" /> In addition, as taxable trading volumes fell, so did revenues from capital gains taxes, entirely offsetting revenues from the equity transactions tax that had grown to 4,000 million Swedish kronor by 1988.<ref name=\"ideas.repec.org\" />\n\nOn the day that the tax was announced, share prices fell by 2.2%. But there was leakage of information prior to the announcement, which might explain the 5.35% price decline in the 30 days prior to the announcement. When the tax was doubled, prices again fell by another 1%. These declines were in line with the capitalized value of future tax payments resulting from expected trades. It was further felt that the taxes on fixed-income securities only served to increase the cost of government borrowing, providing another argument against the tax.\n\nEven though the tax on fixed-income securities was much lower than that on equities, the impact on market trading was much more dramatic. During the first week of the tax, the volume of bond trading fell by 85%, even though the tax rate on five-year bonds was only 0.003%. The volume of futures trading fell by 98% and the options trading market disappeared.   On 15 April 1990, the tax on fixed-income securities was abolished. In January 1991 the rates on the remaining taxes were cut in half and by the end of the year they were abolished completely.  Once the taxes were eliminated, trading volumes returned and grew substantially in the 1990s.\n\n====Tobin tax proponents reaction to the Swedish experience====\nThe Swedish experience of a transaction tax was with purchase or sale of equity securities, fixed income securities and derivatives. In global international currency trading, however, the situation could, some argue, look quite different.\n\nWrobel's studies do not address the global economy as a whole, as James Tobin did when he spoke of \"the nineties' [[liquidity crisis|crises]] in Mexico, South East Asia and Russia,\"<ref name=\"eumed1\"/><ref name=\"spiegel1\" /> which included the [[1994 economic crisis in Mexico]], the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]], and the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]].\n\n===Who would gain and who would lose if the Tobin tax (FTT) were implemented?===\n{{See also|Financial transaction tax|Let Wall Street Pay for the Restoration of Main Street Bill}}\n\n====Views of ABAC (APEC Business Advisory Council) expressed in open letter to IMF====\nThe [[APEC Business Advisory Council]], the business representatives' body in [[APEC]], which is the forum for facilitating economic growth, cooperation, trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region, expressed its views in a letter to the IMF on 15 February 2010.<ref name=\"imf.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/consult/2009/pdf/Comment91.pdf|title=Key to the APEC agenda is reduction of transaction costs|author=|date=|website=imf.org}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, ABAC expressed further concerns in the letter:\n\n* Key to the APEC agenda is reduction of transaction costs. The proposal is directly counterproductive to this goal.\n* It would have a very significant negative impact on real economic recovery, as these additional costs are likely to further reduce financing of business activities at a time when markets remain fragile and prospects for the global economy are still uncertain.\n* Industries and consumers as a whole would be unfairly penalized.\n* It would further weaken financial markets and reduce the liquidity, particularly in the case of illiquid assets.\n* Effective implementation would be virtually impossible, especially as opportunities for cross-border arbitrage arise from decisions of certain jurisdictions not to adopt the tax or to exempt particular activities.\n* There is no global consensus why a tax is needed and what the revenue would be used for, and therefore no understanding how much is needed. Any consequential tax would need to be supported by clear consensus for its application.\n\nNote - APEC's 21 Member Economies are Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, China, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, The Republic of the Philippines, The Russian Federation, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, United States of America, Viet Nam.\n\n====Views of the ITUC/APLN (Asia-Pacific Labour Network) expressed in their statement to the 2010 APEC Economic Leaders Meeting====\nThe International Trade Union Confederation/Asia-Pacific Labour Network ([[ITUC]]/APLN), the informal trade union body of the Asia-Pacific, supported the Tobin Tax in their Statement to the 2010 APEC Economic Leaders Meeting.

A financial transactions tax would lead to job losses also in non-financial sectors of the economy through the so-called [[multiplier effect]] forwarding in a magnified form any taxes imposed on Wall Street employees through their reduced demand to their suppliers and supporting industries. The author estimated the ratios of financial- to non-financial job losses of between 10:1 to 10:4, that is \"a 10 percent decrease in securities industry employment would depress employment in the retail, services, and restaurant sectors by more than 1 percent; in the business services sector by about 4 percent; and in total private jobs by about 1 percent.\"<ref name=\"Schwabish\">{{Cite journal|last=Schwabish|first=Jonathan A.|year=2005|title=Estimating Employment Spillover Effects In New York City with an Application to The Stock Transfer Tax|journal=Public Finance Review|volume=33|issue=6|pages=663\u2013689|doi=10.1177/1091142105278945}}</ref>\n\nIt is also possible to estimate the impact of a reduction in stock market volume caused by taxing stock transactions on the rise in the overall unemployment rate.

This is so because these studies report that a reduction of trading activities is associated with lower price volatility.\" So if a study finds that reducing trading volume or trading frequency reduces volatility, these Tobin tax supporters combine it with the observation that Tobin-style taxes are volume-reducing, and thus should also indirectly reduce volatility (\"this finding implies a negative relationship between [..] transaction tax [..] and volatility, because higher transaction costs will 'ceteris paribus' always dampen trading activities).\" (Schulmeister et al., 2008, p.&nbsp;18).<ref name=\"Schulmeister\"/>\n\nSome Tobin tax supporters argue that volatility is better defined as a \"long-term overshooting of speculative prices\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tobin|first=James|year=1978|title=A Proposal for International Monetary Reform.

It was suggested by [[James Tobin]], an economist who won the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]]. Tobin's tax was originally intended to penalize short-term financial round-trip excursions into another currency.  By the late 1990s, however, the term '''Tobin tax''' was being incorrectly used to apply to all forms of short term transaction taxation, whether across currencies or not. Another term for these broader tax schemes is [[Robin Hood tax]], due to tax revenues from the (presumably richer) speculator funding general revenue (of whom the primary beneficiaries are less wealthy).  More exact terms, however, apply to different scopes of tax.\n\n{{TOCLimit|3}}\n\n== Tobin's original proposal ==\n\nTobin suggested his [[currency transaction tax]] in 1972 in his Janeway Lectures at [[Princeton University|Princeton]], shortly after the [[Bretton Woods system]] of [[money|monetary]] management ended in 1971.<ref name=\"Tobin\">{{cite journal |url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/eej/eeconj/v4y1978i3-4p153-159.html |title=A Proposal for International Monetary Reform |author=James Tobin |date=July\u2013October 1978 |journal=Eastern Economic Journal|volume=4 |issue=3\u20134 |pages=153\u2013159|accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref> Prior to 1971, one of the chief features of the Bretton Woods system was an obligation for each country to adopt a [[monetary policy]] that maintained the [[exchange rate]] of its currency within a fixed value\u2014plus or minus one percent\u2014in terms of [[gold]]. Then, on August 15, 1971, United States President [[Richard Nixon]] announced that the [[United States dollar]] would no longer be [[convertibility|convertible to gold]], effectively ending the system. This action created the situation whereby the U.S. dollar became the sole backing of currencies and a [[reserve currency]] for the member states of the Bretton Woods system, leading the system to collapse in the face of increasing financial strain in that same year. In that context, Tobin suggested a new system for international currency stability, and proposed that such a system include an international charge on [[Foreign exchange market|foreign-exchange]] transactions.\n\nIn 2001, in another context, just after \"the nineties' [[liquidity crisis|crises]] in Mexico, Southeast Asia and Russia,\"<ref name=\"ex\">Excerpt from original German article: \"wie die Krisen in Mexiko, S\u00fcdostasien und Russland w\u00e4hrend der neunziger Jahre gezeigt haben.

This dissuades [[speculator]]s as many investors invest their money in foreign exchange on a very short-term basis. If this money is suddenly withdrawn, countries have to drastically increase [[interest rate]]s for their currency to still be attractive.

Accordingly, most debate on the issue has shifted towards a general [[financial transaction tax]] which would capture such proxies.  Other measures to avoid punishing hedging (a form of insurance for cashflows) were also proposed.  By the 2010s the [[Basel II]] and [[Basel III]] frameworks required reporting that would help to differentiate them.<ref name=\"keydifferences.com\">{{cite web|url=http://keydifferences.com/difference-between-hedging-and-speculation.html|title=Difference Between Hedging and Speculation (with Comparison Chart) - Key Differences|date=6 January 2016|publisher=}}</ref> and economic thought was tending to reject the belief that they could not be differentiated, or (as the \"Chicago School\" had held) should not be.\n\n== Recent proposals ==\n\nIn March 2016 [[China]] drafted rules to impose a genuine [[currency transaction tax]] and this was referred to in financial press as a '''Tobin tax''' [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-15/china-said-to-draft-rules-for-tobin-tax-on-currency-transactions].  This was widely viewed as a warning to curb shorting of its currency the [[Renminbi|yuan]].  It was however expected to keep this tax at 0% initially, calculating potential revenue from different rate schemes and exemptions, and not to impose the actual tax unless speculation increased.\n\nAlso in 2016 [[US Democratic Party]] [[POTUS]] nominee [[Hillary Clinton]] included in her platform a vow to \"Impose a tax on high-frequency trading. The growth of high-frequency trading has unnecessarily placed stress on our markets, created instability, and enabled unfair and abusive trading strategies. Hillary would impose a tax on harmful high-frequency trading and reform rules to make our stock markets fairer, more open, and transparent.\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/wall-street/|title=Hillary Clinton on Wall Street reform|publisher=}}</ref> However, the term \"high-frequency\" implied that only a few large volume transaction players engaged in [[arbitrage]] would likely be affected. Clinton referred separately to \"Impose a risk fee on the largest financial institutions. Big banks and financial companies would be required to pay a fee based on their size and their risk of contributing to another crisis.\" The calculations of such fees would necessarily depend on [[financial risk management]] criteria (see [[Basel II]] and [[Basel III]]). Because of its restriction to so-called \"harmful high-frequency trading\" rather than to inter-currency transactions, neither of Clinton's proposals could be considered a true '''Tobin tax''' though international exposure would be a factor in the \"risk fee\".\n\n==Concepts and definitions==\n\n=== hedging vs. speculation ===\n\nCritics of all [[financial transaction tax]]es and [[currency transaction tax]]es emphasize the [[financial risk management]] difficulty of differentiating [[hedge (finance)|hedging]] from [[speculation]],<ref name=\"books.google.ca\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EsaCMRHILb8C&pg=PA196&lpg=PA196&dq=differentiate%20speculation%20from%20hedging%20tax#v=onepage&q=differentiate%20speculation%20from%20hedging%20tax&f=false|title=Europe's Monetary Future|last=Collignon|first=Stefan|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=9780838636060|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>http://validusrm.com/news/hedging-and-speculation-two-sides-of-the-same-coin/</ref> and the economic argument (attributed to the \"Chicago School\") that they cannot in principle be differentiated.

In his view, \"currency exchanges transmit disturbances originating in international financial markets. National economies and national governments are not capable of adjusting to massive movements of funds across the foreign exchanges, without real hardship and without significant sacrifice of the objectives of national economic policy with respect to employment, output, and inflation.\"<ref name=\"Tobin\"/>\n\nTobin saw two solutions to this issue. The first was to move \"toward a common currency, common monetary and fiscal policy, and economic integration.\"<ref name=\"Tobin\"/> The second was to move \"toward greater financial segmentation between nations or currency areas, permitting their central banks and governments greater autonomy in policies tailored to their specific economic institutions and objectives.\"<ref name=\"Tobin\"/> Tobin's preferred solution was the former one but he did not see this as politically viable so he advocated for the latter approach: \"I therefore regretfully recommend the second, and my proposal is to throw some sand in the wheels of our excessively efficient international money markets.\"<ref name=\"Tobin\"/>\n\nTobin's method of \"throwing sand in the wheels\" was to suggest a tax on all spot conversions of one currency into another, proportional to the size of the transaction.<ref name=\"Tobin\"/> In the development of his idea, Tobin was influenced by the earlier work of [[John Maynard Keynes]] on general financial transaction taxes.<ref name=\"Jubilee-trans\"/><ref name=\"Reiermann\"/>\n\nKeynes' concept stems from 1936 when he proposed that a [[Financial transaction tax|transaction tax]] should be levied on dealings on [[Wall Street]], where he argued that excessive speculation by uninformed financial traders increased volatility. For Keynes (who [[John Maynard Keynes#Personal life|was himself a speculator]]) the key issue was the proportion of 'speculators' in the market, and his concern that, if left unchecked, these types of players would become too dominant.<ref name=\"Keynes\">{{cite web |url=http://biblioeconomicus.googlepages.com/KeynesJohnMaynard-TheGeneralTheoryOfEmploymentInterestAndMoney.pdf  |title=The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money | pages =104, 105 (Chapter 12, Part VI)|author=John Maynard Keynes |year=1936}} (Online publisher: Project Gutenberg of Australia eBooks; via biblioeconomicus.googlepages.com)</ref>\n\n===Variations on Tobin tax idea ===\n\nThe most common variations on Tobin's idea are a general [[currency transaction tax]], a more general [[financial transaction tax]] and (the most general) [[Robin Hood tax]] on transactions only richer investors can afford to engage in.\n\n==== Pollin and Baker ====\n\nA key issue with Tobin's tax was \"avoidance by change of product mix... market participants would have an incentive to substitute out of financial instruments subject to the tax and into instruments not subject to it. In this fashion, markets would innovate so as to avoid the tax... [so] focusing on just spot currency markets would clearly induce a huge shifting of transactions into futures and derivatives markets. Thus, the real issue is how to design a tax that takes account of all the methods and margins of substitution that investors have for changing their patterns of activity to avoid the tax. Taking account of these considerations implies a '''Tobin tax''' that is bigger in scope, and pushes the design toward a generalized [[securities transaction tax]] that resembles the tax suggested by Pollin et al. (1999). There are four benefits to this. First, it is likely to generate significantly greater revenues.

Many people have therefore argued that it would be best implemented by an international institution.  It has been proposed that having the [[United Nations]] manage a Tobin tax would solve this problem and would give the UN a large source of funding independent from donations by participating states. However, there have also been initiatives of national dimension about the tax. (This is in addition to the [[Foreign exchange controls|many countries that have foreign exchange controls]].)\n\nWhilst finding some support in countries with strong left-wing political movements such as France and [[Latin America]], the Tobin tax proposal came under much criticism from economists and governments, especially those with liberal markets and a large international banking sector, who said it would be impossible to implement and would destabilise foreign exchange markets.\n\nMost of the actual implementation of Tobin taxes, whether in the form of a specific [[currency transaction tax]], or a more general [[financial transaction tax]], has occurred at a national level.

Thus a round trip (purchase and sale) transaction resulted in a 1% tax.  In July 1986 the rate was doubled. In January 1989, a considerably lower tax of 0.002% on fixed-income securities was introduced for a security with a maturity of 90 days or less. On a bond with a maturity of five years or more, the tax was 0.003%.\n\nThe revenues from taxes were disappointing; for example, revenues from the tax on fixed-income securities were initially expected to amount to 1,500 million Swedish kronor per year. They did not amount to more than 80 million Swedish kronor in any year and the average was closer to 50 million.<ref name=\"papers.ssrn.com\">{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=John Y.|last2=Froot|first2=Kenneth A.|date=December 1993|title=International Experiences with Securities Transaction Taxes (NBER Working Paper No. W4587)|ssrn=338864}}</ref> In addition, as taxable trading volumes fell, so did revenues from capital gains taxes, entirely offsetting revenues from the equity transactions tax that had grown to 4,000 million Swedish kronor by 1988.<ref name=\"ideas.repec.org\">{{cite journal|last1=Umlauf|first1=S|year=1993|title=Transaction taxes and the behavior of the Swedish stock market|journal=Journal of Financial Economics|volume=33|issue=2|page=227|doi=10.1016/0304-405X(93)90005-V}}</ref>\n\nOn the day that the tax was announced, share prices fell by 2.2%. But there was leakage of information prior to the announcement, which might explain the 5.35% price decline in the 30 days prior to the announcement. When the tax was doubled, prices again fell by another 1%. These declines were in line with the capitalized value of future tax payments resulting from expected trades. It was further felt that the taxes on fixed-income securities only served to increase the cost of government borrowing, providing another argument against the tax.\n\nEven though the tax on fixed-income securities was much lower than that on equities, the impact on market trading was much more dramatic. During the first week of the tax, the volume of bond trading fell by 85%, even though the tax rate on five-year bonds was only 0.003%. The volume of futures trading fell by 98% and the options trading market disappeared.   On 15 April 1990, the tax on fixed-income securities was abolished. In January 1991 the rates on the remaining taxes were cut in half and by the end of the year they were abolished completely.  Once the taxes were eliminated, trading volumes returned and grew substantially in the 1990s and 2000s.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hemmelgarn|first=Thomas|last2=Nicodeme|first2=Gaetan|date=2012-02-23|title=Can Tax Policy Help to Prevent Financial Crisis?|language=en-US|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199698165.001.0001|isbn=9780199698165|url=http://fdslive.oup.com/www.oup.com/academic/pdf/openaccess/9780199698165.pdf|hdl=10419/118674}}</ref>\n\n====Tobin tax proponents reaction to the Swedish experience====\nThe Swedish experience of a transaction tax was with purchase or sale of equity securities, fixed income securities and derivatives.

To investigate the feasibility of such a tax they hired the [[City of London]] firm Intelligence Capital, who found that a tax on the [[pound sterling]] wherever it was traded in the world, as opposed to a tax on all currencies traded in the UK, was indeed feasible and could be unilaterally implemented by the UK government.<ref name=\"Spratt\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stampoutpoverty.org/?lid=9889|title=A Sterling Solution|author=Stephen Spratt|date=September 2006|work=Stamp Out Poverty report|publisher=Stamp Out Poverty Campaign}}</ref>\n\nThe Sterling Stamp Duty, as it became known, was to be set at a rate 200 times lower than Tobin had envisaged in 2001, which \"pro Tobin tax\" supporters claim wouldn't have affected currency markets and could still raise large sums of money.

Ramonet proposed to create an association for the introduction of this tax, which was named [[ATTAC]] (Association for the Taxation of financial Transactions for the Aid of Citizens).

They raise interest rates to extraordinary levels to protect investors against currency losses, only to topple their economies and the source of investor profits. ...

Sterling Stamp Duty supporters argue that this tax rate would not adversely affect currency markets and could still raise large sums of money.<ref name=\"Spratt\" />\n\nThe same rate of 0.005% was proposed for a currency transactions tax (CTT) in a report prepared by Rodney Schmidt for The North-South Institute (a [[Canadians|Canadian]] NGO whose \"research supports global efforts to [..] improve international financial systems and institutions\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nsi-ins.ca/english/about/default.asp|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612010011/http://www.nsi-ins.ca/english/about/default.asp|archivedate=2009-06-12|url-status=dead|accessdate=2010-02-27}}</ref> Schmidt (2007) used the observed negative relationship between [[bid\u2013ask spread]]s and transactions volume in foreign exchange markets to estimate the maximum \"non-disruptive rate\" of a currency transaction tax. A CTT tax rate designed with a pragmatic goal of raising revenue for various development projects, rather than to fulfill Tobin's original goals (of \"slowing the flow of capital across borders\" and \"preventing or managing exchange rate crises\"), should avoid altering the existing \"fundamental market behavior\", and thus, according to Schmidt, must not exceed 0.00005, i.e., the observed levels of currency [[transaction cost]]s (bid-ask spreads).<ref name=\"Schmidt-10\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/images/pdfs/10rate.pdf|title=The Currency Transaction Tax: Rate and Revenue Estimates|author=Schmidt, Rodney|date=October 2007|website=|publisher=[[The North-South Institute]]|accessdate=9 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe mathematician [[Paul Wilmott]] has pointed out that while perhaps some trading ought to be discouraged, trading for the hedging of derivatives is generally considered a good thing in that it can reduce risk, and this should not be punished.

Such volume-neutral CTT tax would raise ''relatively little revenue'' though, estimated at around $33 bn annually, i.e., an order of magnitude less than the \"[[carbon tax]] [which] has by far the greatest revenue-raising potential, estimated at $130-750 bn annually.\" The author warns however that both these market-based revenue estimates \"are necessarily [[Speculation|speculative]]\", and he has more confidence in the revenue-raising potential of \"The [[International Finance Facility]] (IFF) and International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm).\"<ref name=\"Schmidt-10\"/>\n\n===Is the tax easy to avoid?===\n\n====Technical feasibility====\nAlthough Tobin had said his own tax idea was unfeasible in practice, [[Joseph Stiglitz]], former Senior Vice President and [[World Bank Chief Economist|Chief Economist]] of the [[World Bank]], said, on October 5, 2009, that modern technology meant that was no longer the case.

Wrobel examined the actual international experiences of various countries in implementing financial transaction taxes.<ref name=\"lessons\"/>  Wrobel's paper highlighted the Swedish experience with financial transaction taxes.  In January 1984, Sweden introduced a 0.5% tax on the purchase or sale of an equity security. Thus a round trip (purchase and sale) transaction resulted in a 1% tax.  In July 1986 the rate was doubled. In January 1989, a considerably lower tax of 0.002% on [[fixed income]] securities was introduced for a security with a maturity of 90 days or less. On a bond with a maturity of five years or more, the tax was 0.003%.\n\nThe revenues from taxes were disappointing; for example, revenues from the tax on fixed-income securities were initially expected to amount to 1,500 million Swedish kronor per year. They did not amount to more than 80 million Swedish kronor in any year and the average was closer to 50 million.<ref name=\"papers.ssrn.com\" /> In addition, as taxable trading volumes fell, so did revenues from capital gains taxes, entirely offsetting revenues from the equity transactions tax that had grown to 4,000 million Swedish kronor by 1988.<ref name=\"ideas.repec.org\" />\n\nOn the day that the tax was announced, share prices fell by 2.2%. But there was leakage of information prior to the announcement, which might explain the 5.35% price decline in the 30 days prior to the announcement. When the tax was doubled, prices again fell by another 1%. These declines were in line with the capitalized value of future tax payments resulting from expected trades. It was further felt that the taxes on fixed-income securities only served to increase the cost of government borrowing, providing another argument against the tax.\n\nEven though the tax on fixed-income securities was much lower than that on equities, the impact on market trading was much more dramatic. During the first week of the tax, the volume of bond trading fell by 85%, even though the tax rate on five-year bonds was only 0.003%. The volume of futures trading fell by 98% and the options trading market disappeared.   On 15 April 1990, the tax on fixed-income securities was abolished. In January 1991 the rates on the remaining taxes were cut in half and by the end of the year they were abolished completely.  Once the taxes were eliminated, trading volumes returned and grew substantially in the 1990s.\n\n====Tobin tax proponents reaction to the Swedish experience====\nThe Swedish experience of a transaction tax was with purchase or sale of equity securities, fixed income securities and derivatives. In global international currency trading, however, the situation could, some argue, look quite different.\n\nWrobel's studies do not address the global economy as a whole, as James Tobin did when he spoke of \"the nineties' [[liquidity crisis|crises]] in Mexico, South East Asia and Russia,\"<ref name=\"eumed1\"/><ref name=\"spiegel1\" /> which included the [[1994 economic crisis in Mexico]], the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]], and the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]].\n\n===Who would gain and who would lose if the Tobin tax (FTT) were implemented?===\n{{See also|Financial transaction tax|Let Wall Street Pay for the Restoration of Main Street Bill}}\n\n====Views of ABAC (APEC Business Advisory Council) expressed in open letter to IMF====\nThe [[APEC Business Advisory Council]], the business representatives' body in [[APEC]], which is the forum for facilitating economic growth, cooperation, trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region, expressed its views in a letter to the IMF on 15 February 2010.<ref name=\"imf.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/consult/2009/pdf/Comment91.pdf|title=Key to the APEC agenda is reduction of transaction costs|author=|date=|website=imf.org}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, ABAC expressed further concerns in the letter:\n\n* Key to the APEC agenda is reduction of transaction costs. The proposal is directly counterproductive to this goal.\n* It would have a very significant negative impact on real economic recovery, as these additional costs are likely to further reduce financing of business activities at a time when markets remain fragile and prospects for the global economy are still uncertain.\n* Industries and consumers as a whole would be unfairly penalized.\n* It would further weaken financial markets and reduce the liquidity, particularly in the case of illiquid assets.\n* Effective implementation would be virtually impossible, especially as opportunities for cross-border arbitrage arise from decisions of certain jurisdictions not to adopt the tax or to exempt particular activities.\n* There is no global consensus why a tax is needed and what the revenue would be used for, and therefore no understanding how much is needed. Any consequential tax would need to be supported by clear consensus for its application.\n\nNote - APEC's 21 Member Economies are Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, China, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, The Republic of the Philippines, The Russian Federation, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, United States of America, Viet Nam.\n\n====Views of the ITUC/APLN (Asia-Pacific Labour Network) expressed in their statement to the 2010 APEC Economic Leaders Meeting====\nThe International Trade Union Confederation/Asia-Pacific Labour Network ([[ITUC]]/APLN), the informal trade union body of the Asia-Pacific, supported the Tobin Tax in their Statement to the 2010 APEC Economic Leaders Meeting.

A financial transactions tax would lead to job losses also in non-financial sectors of the economy through the so-called [[multiplier effect]] forwarding in a magnified form any taxes imposed on Wall Street employees through their reduced demand to their suppliers and supporting industries. The author estimated the ratios of financial- to non-financial job losses of between 10:1 to 10:4, that is \"a 10 percent decrease in securities industry employment would depress employment in the retail, services, and restaurant sectors by more than 1 percent; in the business services sector by about 4 percent; and in total private jobs by about 1 percent.\"<ref name=\"Schwabish\">{{Cite journal|last=Schwabish|first=Jonathan A.|year=2005|title=Estimating Employment Spillover Effects In New York City with an Application to The Stock Transfer Tax|journal=Public Finance Review|volume=33|issue=6|pages=663\u2013689|doi=10.1177/1091142105278945}}</ref>\n\nIt is also possible to estimate the impact of a reduction in stock market volume caused by taxing stock transactions on the rise in the overall unemployment rate.

All of these would have to be taxed together under a \"non-currency\" financial transactions tax (such as under certain proposals in the U.S. in 2009 which, although not intending to tax currencies directly, would still do so due to taxation of currency futures and currency exchange traded funds). Because these three groups of instruments are nearly perfect substitutes, if at least one of these groups were to be exempt, it would likely attract most market volume from the taxed alternatives.<ref name=\"Schulmeister 6\">Schulmeister, p.6</ref>\n\nAccording to Stephan Schulmeister, Margit Schratzenstaller, and Oliver Picek (2008), restricting the financial transactions tax to foreign exchange only (as envisaged originally by Tobin) would not be desirable.<ref name=\"Schulmeister 6\"/> Any \"general FTT seems...more attractive than a specific transaction tax\" (such as a currency-only Tobin tax), because it could reduce tax avoidance (i.e., substitution of similar untaxed instruments), could significantly increase the tax base and could be implemented more easily on organized exchanges than in a dealership market like the global foreign exchange market.<ref name=\"Schulmeister 6\"/> (See also [[#Is the tax easy to avoid?|the discussion of tax avoidance as it relates to a currency transaction tax]].)\n\nOn October 5, 2009, [[Joseph Stiglitz]] said that any new tax should be levied on all asset classes \u2013 not merely foreign exchange, and would be based on the gross value of the assets, thereby helping to discourage the creation of asset bubbles.<ref name=\"Edmund Conway\"/>\n\n==Non-tax regulatory equivalent==\nOne non-tax regulatory equivalent of Tobin's (very narrow original) tax is to require \"non-interest bearing deposit requirements on all open foreign exchange positions.\".<ref name=\"books.google.ca\" />  If these deposit requirements result in forfeits or losses if a currency suddenly declines due to speculation, they act as inhibitions against deliberate speculative shorts of a currency.  However, they would not raise funds for other purposes, so are not a tax.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Money}}\n* [[Bank tax]]\n* [[Currency transaction tax]]\n* [[Financial transaction tax]]\n* [[Foreign exchange market]]\n* [[Robin Hood tax]]\n* [[Spahn tax]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite journal | first1=Johannes | last1=Kaiser | first2=Thorsten | last2=Chmura | first3= Thomas | last3= Pitz | date=July 2007 | ssrn=936924 | title=The Tobin Tax - A Game-Theoretical and an Experimental Approach | publisher=Social Science Electronic Publishing }}\n* {{Cite book | first=Heikki | last=Patom\u00e4ki | date=August 2001 | title=Democratising Globalisation: The Leverage of the Tobin Tax | publisher=Zed Books | isbn=978-1-85649-871-5 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/democratizingglo0000pato }}\n* {{Cite book | first=Mahbub ul | last= Haq | first2=Inge | last2=Kaul | first3=Isabelle | last3=Grunberg | date=August 1996 | title=The Tobin Tax: Coping with Financial Volatility | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-511180-4}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090327092433/http://www.bportugal.pt/publish/bolecon/docs/2003_2_3_e.pdf Bank of Portugal report on the defense of the Portuguese Escudo in the European exchange rate mechanism]\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8348653.stm BBC 7 November 2009 Lukewarm reaction to UK tax plan]\n* [http://www.tobintax.org/biblio.htm \"Bibliography - Best Sources on Financing Alternatives, and Tobin Taxes\" (includes economists on both sides of the issue of economic feasibility) from website of ''Tobin Tax Initiative'']\n* [http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/glotax/currtax/index.htm Currency Transaction Taxes - Library of links to legislation, proposals, reports, articles and archives - from Global Policy Forum]\n* [http://www.new-rules.org/storage/documents/other/debatingthetobintax.pdf Debating the Tobin Tax], New Rules for Global Finance, 2003\n* [http://mondediplo.com/1997/12/leader Disarming the markets], editorial by Ignacio Ramonet, Le Monde Diplomatique 1997\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050306201839/http://www.jubilee2000uk.org/worldnews/lamerica/james_tobin_030901_english.htm English version of James Tobin interview on Der Spiegel on [[Jubilee 2000]] web site]\n* [http://www.frbsf.org/econrsrch/wklyltr/wklyltr99/el99-36.html Federal reserve bank of San Francisco article on the failed attack on the Hong Kong dollar]\n* [http://www.imf.org/external/np/leg/sem/2004/cdmfl/eng/takagi.pdf IMF report (2004) on emerging market currency crises]\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/business/story/0,3604,544098,00.html  The Guardian editorializes against the Tobin tax]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tobin Tax}}\n[[Category:International taxation]]\n[[Category:Financial transaction tax]]\n[[Category:Anti-globalization movement]]\n", "name_user": "Davide King", "label": "safe", "comment": "ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobin_tax"}
