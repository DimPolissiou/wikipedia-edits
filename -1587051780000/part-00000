Five issues later, she recruits the besotted costumed archer and later superhero [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] to her cause.

From ''The Avengers'' #36 (Jan. 1967), art by [[Don Heck]].]]\nNatasha was born in [[Stalingrad]] (now Volgograd), [[RSFSR|Russia]], [[USSR]]. The first and best-known Black Widow is a [[Russians|Russian]] agent trained as a spy, martial artist, and sniper, and outfitted with an arsenal of high-tech weaponry, including a pair of wrist-mounted energy weapons dubbed her \"Widow's Bite\". She wears no costume during her first few appearances but simply [[formal wear|evening wear]] and a veil. Romanova eventually defects to the U.S. for reasons that include her love for the reluctant-criminal turned superhero [[Archery|archer]], [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]].\n\nThe first hints to Natasha Romanova's childhood come from Ivan Petrovich, who is introduced as her middle-aged chauffeur and confidant in the Black Widow's 1970s ''[[Amazing Adventures]]''. Petrovich tells [[Matt Murdock]] that he had been given custody of little Natasha by a woman who died immediately afterwards, during the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in autumn 1942. He consequently felt committed to raise the orphan as a surrogate father and she eventually trained as a [[Soviet]] spy, being eager to help her homeland.<ref>''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' issue #88 (June 1972)</ref> In another [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], set in the fictional island of [[Madripoor]] in 1941, Petrovich helps [[Captain America]] and the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] Logan, who would later become the [[Canadians|Canadian]] super-agent and costumed hero [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], to rescue Natasha from [[Nazism|Nazis]].<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men|The Uncanny X-Men]]'' issue #268 (Sept. 1990)</ref>\n\nA revised, [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] origin establishes her as being raised from very early childhood by the U.S.S.R.'s \"Black Widow Ops\" program, rather than solely by Ivan Petrovitch.<ref>''Black Widow'' #1\u20136 (Nov. 2004\u2013April 2005)</ref> Petrovitch had taken her to Department X, with other young female orphans, where she was [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] and trained in combat and espionage at the covert \"[[Red Room (comics)|Red Room]]\" facility. There, she is biotechnologically and psycho-technologically enhanced\u2014which provides a rationale for her unusually long and youthful lifespan. During that time she had some training under the [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]], and the pair even had a short romance.<ref>''[[Captain America]]'' vol. 5, #27 (Aug. 2007)</ref> Each Black Widow is deployed with false memories to help ensure her loyalty. The only real memories natasha has of her time in the red room was when she practiced ballet hours on end.\n\nThe KGB arranged a marriage between Natasha and the renowned Soviet test pilot [[Red Guardian#Alexei Shostakov|Alexei Shostakov]]. However, when the Soviet government decided to make Shostakov into their new operative, the Red Guardian, he is told that he can have no further contact with his wife. Natasha is told that he died and is trained as a secret agent separately.\n\n===The Avengers===\nRomanova grew up to serve as a femme fatale. She was assigned to assist [[Crimson Dynamo#The second Crimson Dynamo|Boris Turgenov]] in the assassination of [[Crimson Dynamo#The original Crimson Dynamo|Professor Anton Vanko]] for defecting from the Soviet Union, which served as her first mission in the United States. Natasha and Turgenov infiltrated [[Stark Industries]] as part of the plan.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' Vol 1 #52</ref> She attempted to manipulate information from American [[defense contractor]] Tony Stark, and inevitably confronted his superhero alter ego, [[Iron Man]]. The pair then battled Iron Man, and Turgenov stole and wore the Crimson Dynamo suit. Vanko sacrificed himself to save Iron Man, killing Turgenov in the process, using an unstable experimental laser light pistol.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #52\u201353 (Apr. 1964\u2013May 1964)</ref> Romanova later meets the criminal archer [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] and sets him against Iron Man,<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #57 (Sept. 1964)</ref> and later helped Hawkeye battle Iron Man.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #60 (Dec. 1964)</ref>\n\nLater, Natasha again attempted to get Hawkeye to help her destroy Iron Man. The pair almost succeeded, but when Black Widow was injured, Hawkeye retreated to get her to safety.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #64</ref> During this period, Romanova was attempting to defect from the Soviet Union and began falling in love with Hawkeye, weakening her loyalty to her country.

As she tells Sam she can't save them all, Sam explains it's Natasha's job to assist in the effort to save as many people as possible before Earth as they know it is destroyed. As she leaves, her mind transitions to [[Cold War]] Russia, where a young Natasha (here called Natalia) speaks with two Russian functionaries in the infamous \"Red Room\". She is given her first mission: travel to Cuba and locate a family called the Comienzas, who are at risk from [[Ra\u00fal Castro]]'s regime and who may have information of vital importance to Russia. She is told to rendezvous with another agent, her classmate Marina, and befriend the family under the guise of a Russian businesswoman. Natasha assures them of her competency and leaves. When one of the officers questions her youth, the other assures him, \"she's a killer. She will not disappoint.\" Natasha meets Marina in Cuba and the two friends catch up before meeting with the Comienzas that night at a local bar. Using her talent for deception, she casually and politely convinces the husband and wife that she's seeking inside information to help her import various goods into the country. The Comienzas explain they can't reveal said information, prompting Natasha to later explain to Marina that the family might need \"a little push\". Not too soon she effectively began terrorizing the family into desperation. First, she plants an American flag on their doorstep to mimic someone accusing them of defecting to the United States. Later after meeting with one of the Russian officers from the Red Room to report her progress, she detonated a car bomb outside their home when the first attempt didn't make them \"nearly desperate enough\". Following the car bomb explosion, Natasha declares the family is indeed desperate enough to reproach for information.

Having no problem following orders she sets up a meet and using a sniper rifle she takes out the pair without blinking. Next she shoots Marina's boyfriend then Marina herself. Next she shoots Marina's cat. Flipping back to the present, Black Widow is back saving people from the incursion as the reason that triggered Natasha's flashback is revealed ... a man she saved is holding his cat.

Created by editor and plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Don Rico]], and artist [[Don Heck]], the character debuted in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #52 (April 1964). The character was introduced as a [[Russia]]n [[espionage|spy]], an antagonist of the superhero [[Iron Man]]. She later [[Defection|defected]] to the United States, becoming an agent of the fictional spy agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and a member of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].\n\n[[Scarlett Johansson]] portrays the [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|character]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010), ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012), ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014), ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (both 2019).

Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Paul Reinman]]]]\n\nThe Black Widow's first appearances were as a recurring, non-costumed, [[Russia]]n-[[espionage|spy]] antagonist in the feature \"[[Iron Man]]\", beginning in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #52 (April 1964). Five issues later, she recruits the besotted costumed archer and later superhero [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] to her cause. Her government later supplies her with her first Black Widow costume and high-tech weaponry, but she eventually defects to the United States after appearing, temporarily brainwashed against the U.S., in the superhero-team series ''[[The Avengers (comic)|The Avengers]]'' #29 (July 1966). The Widow later becomes a recurring ally of the team before officially becoming its sixteenth member many years later.\n\nThe Black Widow was visually updated in 1970: ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #86 (July 1970) reintroduced her with shoulder-length red hair (instead of her former short black hair), a skintight black costume, and wristbands which fired spider threads. This would become the appearance most commonly associated with the character.<ref name=\"back45\">{{cite journal|last= Carson|first= Lex|date= December 2010|title= Daredevil and the Black Widow: A Swinging Couple of Crimefighters|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 45| pages= 31\u201338|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>\n\nIn short order, The Black Widow starred in her own series in ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' #1\u20138 (Aug. 1970\u2013Sept. 1971), sharing that split book with the feature [[Inhumans]]. The Black Widow feature was dropped after only eight issues (the Inhumans feature followed soon, ending with issue 10).<ref name=\"back45\"/>\n\nImmediately after her initial solo feature ended, the Black Widow co-starred in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]] '' #81\u2013124 (Nov. 1971\u2013Aug. 1975), of which #92-107 were cover titled ''Daredevil and the Black Widow''. ''Daredevil'' writer [[Gerry Conway]] recounted, \"It was my idea to team up Daredevil and the Black Widow, mainly because I was a fan of Natasha, and thought she and Daredevil would have interesting chemistry.\"<ref name=\"back45\"/> Succeeding writers, however, felt that Daredevil worked better as a solo hero, and gradually wrote the Black Widow out of the series.<ref name=\"back45\"/> She was immediately recast into the super-team series ''[[Champions (1975 team)|The Champions]]'' as the leader of the titular superhero group, which ran for 17 issues (Oct. 1975\u2013Jan. 1978).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Karen|title='We'll Keep on Fighting 'Til the End': The Story of the Champions|journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=65|pages=17\u201323|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=July 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, the Black Widow appeared frequently as both an Avengers member and a freelance agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] She starred in a serialized feature within the omnibus comic-book series ''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'' #10\u201313 (Aug. 1983\u2013March 1984), written by [[George P\u00e9rez]] and [[Ralph Macchio (editor)|Ralph Macchio]], with art by [[penciller]] Perez. These stories were later collected in the oversized [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Black Widow: Web of Intrigue'' #1 (June 1999).\n\nThe Widow guest-starred in issues of ''Solo Avengers'', ''[[Force Works]]'', ''Iron Man'', ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', and other comics.

From ''The Avengers'' #36 (Jan. 1967), art by [[Don Heck]].]]\nNatasha was born in [[Stalingrad]] (now Volgograd), [[RSFSR|Russia]], [[USSR]]. The first and best-known Black Widow is a [[Russians|Russian]] agent trained as a spy, martial artist, and sniper, and outfitted with an arsenal of high-tech weaponry, including a pair of wrist-mounted energy weapons dubbed her \"Widow's Bite\". She wears no costume during her first few appearances but simply [[formal wear|evening wear]] and a veil. Romanova eventually defects to the U.S. for reasons that include her love for the reluctant-criminal turned superhero [[Archery|archer]], [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]].\n\nThe first hints to Natasha Romanova's childhood come from Ivan Petrovich, who is introduced as her middle-aged chauffeur and confidant in the Black Widow's 1970s ''[[Amazing Adventures]]''. Petrovich tells [[Matt Murdock]] that he had been given custody of little Natasha by a woman who died immediately afterwards, during the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in autumn 1942. He consequently felt committed to raise the orphan as a surrogate father and she eventually trained as a [[Soviet]] spy, being eager to help her homeland.<ref>''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' issue #88 (June 1972)</ref> In another [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], set in the fictional island of [[Madripoor]] in 1941, Petrovich helps [[Captain America]] and the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] Logan, who would later become the [[Canadians|Canadian]] super-agent and costumed hero [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], to rescue Natasha from [[Nazism|Nazis]].<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men|The Uncanny X-Men]]'' issue #268 (Sept. 1990)</ref>\n\nA revised, [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] origin establishes her as being raised from very early childhood by the U.S.S.R.'s \"Black Widow Ops\" program, rather than solely by Ivan Petrovitch.<ref>''Black Widow'' #1\u20136 (Nov. 2004\u2013April 2005)</ref> Petrovitch had taken her to Department X, with other young female orphans, where she was [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] and trained in combat and espionage at the covert \"[[Red Room (comics)|Red Room]]\" facility. There, she is biotechnologically and psycho-technologically enhanced\u2014which provides a rationale for her unusually long and youthful lifespan. During that time she had some training under the [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]], and the pair even had a short romance.<ref>''[[Captain America]]'' vol. 5, #27 (Aug. 2007)</ref> Each Black Widow is deployed with false memories to help ensure her loyalty. Romanova eventually discovers this, including the fact that she had never, as she had believed, been a [[ballerina]]. She further discovers that the Red Room is still active as \"2R\".\n\nThe KGB arranged a marriage between Natasha and the renowned Soviet test pilot [[Red Guardian#Alexei Shostakov|Alexei Shostakov]]. However, when the Soviet government decided to make Shostakov into their new operative, the Red Guardian, he is told that he can have no further contact with his wife. Natasha is told that he died and is trained as a secret agent separately.\n\n===The Avengers===\nRomanova grew up to serve as a femme fatale. She was assigned to assist [[Crimson Dynamo#The second Crimson Dynamo|Boris Turgenov]] in the assassination of [[Crimson Dynamo#The original Crimson Dynamo|Professor Anton Vanko]] for defecting from the Soviet Union, which served as her first mission in the United States. Natasha and Turgenov infiltrated [[Stark Industries]] as part of the plan.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' Vol 1 #52</ref> She attempted to manipulate information from American [[defense contractor]] Tony Stark, and inevitably confronted his superhero alter ego, [[Iron Man]]. The pair then battled Iron Man, and Turgenov stole and wore the Crimson Dynamo suit. Vanko sacrificed himself to save Iron Man, killing Turgenov in the process, using an unstable experimental laser light pistol.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #52\u201353 (Apr. 1964\u2013May 1964)</ref> Romanova later meets the criminal archer [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] and sets him against Iron Man,<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #57 (Sept. 1964)</ref> and later helped Hawkeye battle Iron Man.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #60 (Dec. 1964)</ref>\n\nLater, Natasha again attempted to get Hawkeye to help her destroy Iron Man. The pair almost succeeded, but when Black Widow was injured, Hawkeye retreated to get her to safety.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #64</ref> During this period, Romanova was attempting to defect from the Soviet Union and began falling in love with Hawkeye, weakening her loyalty to her country.

She pilots a ship holding a handpicked few to restart humanity after the universe ends, copiloted by [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]]. Her ship is shot down during the battle though, and she is killed in the ensuing explosion.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #1</ref>\n\nAs the evacuation of Earth-616 begins in light of the fact that Earth-1610 is about to come crashing down as part of the \"Last Days\" storyline, Black Widow is seen standing atop a building with Captain America who gives her a list of people to save and bring aboard the lifeboat. As she tells Sam she can't save them all, Sam explains it's Natasha's job to assist in the effort to save as many people as possible before Earth as they know it is destroyed. As she leaves, her mind transitions to [[Cold War]] Russia, where a young Natasha (here called Natalia) speaks with two Russian functionaries in the infamous \"Red Room\". She is given her first mission: travel to Cuba and locate a family called the Comienzas, who are at risk from [[Ra\u00fal Castro]]'s regime and who may have information of vital importance to Russia. She is told to rendezvous with another agent, her classmate Marina, and befriend the family under the guise of a Russian businesswoman. Natasha assures them of her competency and leaves. When one of the officers questions her youth, the other assures him, \"she's a killer. She will not disappoint.\" Natasha meets Marina in Cuba and the two friends catch up before meeting with the Comienzas that night at a local bar. Using her talent for deception, she casually and politely convinces the husband and wife that she's seeking inside information to help her import various goods into the country. The Comienzas explain they can't reveal said information, prompting Natasha to later explain to Marina that the family might need \"a little push\". Not too soon she effectively began terrorizing the family into desperation. First, she plants an American flag on their doorstep to mimic someone accusing them of defecting to the United States. Later after meeting with one of the Russian officers from the Red Room to report her progress, she detonated a car bomb outside their home when the first attempt didn't make them \"nearly desperate enough\". Following the car bomb explosion, Natasha declares the family is indeed desperate enough to reproach for information. Before letting Natasha go, the officer announces she has one additional task before her mission is over: Marina has become too much enamored with her civilian guise, and is now a security risk. Natasha will have to eliminate her.<ref>''Black Widow'' Vol. 5 #19</ref> Flipping to the present, Black Widow is saving as many people as she can, but she quickly flashbacks to Havana. Natasha and her then Red Room partner Marina are trying to help a family defect. Natasha's orders are simple: Kill the parents and make it public. When Natasha asks if she should kill the child too, her boss looks horrified that she would be so OK with that and tells her no. Having no problem following orders she sets up a meet and using a sniper rifle she takes out the pair without blinking. Next she shoots Marina's boyfriend then Marina herself. Next she shoots Marina's cat. Flipping back to the present, Black Widow is back saving people from the incursion as the reason that triggered Natasha's flashback is revealed ... a man she saved is holding his cat. This dark, heartless side of the Black Widow shows why she is trying so hard to do good today.<ref>''Black Widow'' Vol. 5 #20</ref>\n\n===Secret Empire===\n{{long plot|date=January 2018}}\n\nDuring the \"[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]\" storyline, Black Widow appears as a member of the underground resistance at the time when most of the United States has been taken over by Hydra and Captain America who was brainwashed by Red Skull's clone using the powers of the sentient [[Cosmic Cube]] [[List of Marvel Comics characters: K#Kobik|Kobik]] into believing that he was a Hydra sleeper agent.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1</ref> While Hawkeye assembles a strike force of Hercules and Quicksilver to find the Cosmic Cube fragments, Black Widow sets off to kill Rogers herself reasoning that even if Rick's theory is true, the man Rogers was would prefer to die than be used in this manner.
