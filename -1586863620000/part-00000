She notices a talking, clothed [[White Rabbit|white rabbit]] with a [[pocket watch]] run past. She follows it down a rabbit hole where she suddenly falls a long way to a curious hall with many locked doors of all sizes. She finds a little key to a door too small for her to fit through, but through it, she sees an attractive garden. She then discovers a bottle on a table labelled \"DRINK ME,\" the contents of which cause her to shrink too small to reach the key which she had left on the table. She subsequently eats a cake labelled \"EAT ME\" in currants as the chapter closes.\n\n'''Chapter Two \u2013 The Pool of Tears''': The chapter opens with Alice growing to such a tremendous size that her head hits the ceiling. Unhappy, Alice begins to cry and her tears literally flood the hallway. Shrinking down again due to a fan she had picked up, Alice swims through her own tears and meets a [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|mouse]], who is swimming as well. Alice, thinking he may be a French mouse, tries to make small talk with him in elementary French. Her opening gambit \"''O\u00f9 est ma chatte?''\" ({{Trans|\"Where is my cat?\"}}), however, offends the mouse, who then tries to escape her.\n\n'''Chapter Three \u2013 The Caucus Race and a Long Tale''': {{anchor|Caucus Race}}The sea of tears becomes crowded with other animals and birds that have been swept away by the rising waters. Alice and the other animals convene on the bank and the question among them is how to get dry again. Mouse gives them a very dry lecture on [[William the Conqueror]]. A [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|dodo]] decides that the best thing to dry them off would be a Caucus-Race, which consists of everyone running in a circle with no clear winner. Alice eventually frightens all the animals away, unwittingly, by talking about her (moderately ferocious) cat.\n\n'''Chapter Four \u2013 The Rabbit Sends a Little Bill''': White Rabbit appears again in search of the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]]'s gloves and fan. Mistaking her for his [[maidservant]], Mary Ann, Rabbit orders Alice to go into the house and retrieve them. Inside the house she finds another little bottle and drinks from it, immediately beginning to grow again. The horrified Rabbit orders his gardener, [[Bill the Lizard]], to climb on the roof and go down the chimney. Outside, Alice hears the voices of animals that have gathered to gawk at her giant arm. The crowd hurls pebbles at her, which turn into little cakes. Alice eats them, and they reduce her again in size.\n\n'''Chapter Five \u2013 Advice from a Caterpillar''': Alice comes upon a mushroom and sitting on it is a [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|blue caterpillar]] smoking a [[hookah]]. Caterpillar questions Alice, who begins to admit to her current identity crisis, compounded by [[How Doth the Little Crocodile|her inability to remember a poem]]. Before crawling away, the caterpillar tells Alice that one side of the mushroom will make her taller and the other side will make her shorter. She breaks off two pieces from the mushroom. One side makes her shrink smaller than ever, while another causes her neck to grow high into the trees, where a pigeon mistakes her for a serpent. With some effort, Alice brings herself back to her normal height. She stumbles upon a small estate and uses the mushroom to reach a more appropriate height.\n\n[[File:De Alice's Abenteuer im Wunderland Carroll pic 23 edited 1 of 2.png|thumb|right|The [[Cheshire Cat]]]]\n'''Chapter Six \u2013 Pig and Pepper''': A fish-[[footman]] has an invitation for the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]] of the house, which he delivers to a frog-footman. Alice observes this transaction and, after a perplexing conversation with the frog, lets herself into the house. The Duchess's cook is throwing dishes and making a soup that has too much pepper, which causes Alice, the Duchess, and her baby (but not the cook or grinning [[Cheshire Cat]]) to sneeze violently. Alice is given the baby by the Duchess and, to Alice's surprise, the baby turns into a pig. The Cheshire Cat appears in a tree, directing her to the [[March Hare]]'s house. He disappears but his grin remains behind to float on its own in the air prompting Alice to remark that she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat.\n\n'''Chapter Seven \u2013 A Mad Tea-Party''': Alice becomes a guest at a \"mad\" tea party along with the [[March Hare]], the [[The Hatter|Hatter]], and a very tired [[Dormouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dormouse]], who falls asleep frequently only to be violently awakened moments later by the March Hare and the Hatter. The characters give Alice many riddles and stories, including the famous \"[[why is a raven like a writing desk?]].\" The Hatter reveals that they have tea all day because [https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Time Time] has punished him by eternally standing still at 6&nbsp;PM (tea time). Alice becomes insulted and tired of being bombarded with riddles and she leaves claiming that it was the stupidest tea party that she had ever been to.\n\n[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 30.png|thumb|left|upright|Alice trying to play [[croquet]] with a [[Flamingo]].]]\n'''Chapter Eight \u2013 The Queen's Croquet Ground''': Alice leaves the tea party and enters the garden where she comes upon three living playing cards painting the white roses on a rose tree red because [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen of Hearts]] hates white roses. A procession of more cards, kings and queens and even the White Rabbit enters the garden. Alice then meets the King and Queen. The Queen, a figure difficult to please, introduces her signature phrase \"Off with his head!\" which she utters at the slightest dissatisfaction with a subject. Alice is invited (or some might say ordered) to play a game of croquet with the Queen and the rest of her subjects but the game quickly descends into chaos. Live flamingos are used as mallets and hedgehogs as balls and Alice once again meets the Cheshire Cat. The Queen of Hearts then orders the Cat to be beheaded, only to have her executioner complain that this is impossible since the head is all that can be seen of him. Because the cat belongs to the Duchess, the Queen is prompted to release the Duchess from prison to resolve the matter.\n\n'''Chapter Nine \u2013 The Mock Turtle's Story''': The Duchess is brought to the croquet ground at Alice's request. She ruminates on finding morals in everything around her. The Queen of Hearts dismisses her on the threat of execution and she introduces Alice to the [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Gryphon]], who takes her to the [[Mock Turtle]]. The Mock Turtle is very sad, even though he has no sorrow. He tries to tell his story about how he used to be a real turtle in school, which the Gryphon interrupts so they can play a game.\n\n{{anchor|Lobster Quadrille}}\n'''Chapter Ten \u2013 Lobster Quadrille''': The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon dance to the Lobster Quadrille, while Alice recites (rather incorrectly) \"[['Tis the Voice of the Lobster]]\". The Mock Turtle sings them \"Beautiful Soup\" during which the Gryphon drags Alice away for an impending trial.\n\n'''Chapter Eleven \u2013 Who Stole the Tarts?''': Alice attends a trial whereby the [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Knave of Hearts]] is accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The jury is composed of various animals, including [[Bill the Lizard]], the White Rabbit is the court's trumpeter, and the judge is the [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|King of Hearts]].\nDuring the proceedings, Alice finds that she is steadily growing larger. The dormouse scolds Alice and tells her she has no right to grow at such a rapid pace and take up all the air. Alice scoffs and calls the dormouse's accusation ridiculous because everyone grows and she cannot help it. Meanwhile, witnesses at the trial include the Hatter, who displeases and frustrates the King through his indirect answers to the questioning, and the Duchess's cook.\n\n'''Chapter Twelve \u2013 Alice's Evidence''': Alice is then called up as a witness. She accidentally knocks over the jury box with the animals inside them and the King orders the animals be placed back into their seats before the trial continues. The King and Queen order Alice to be gone, citing Rule 42 (\"All persons more than a mile high to leave the court\"), but Alice disputes their judgement and refuses to leave. She argues with the King and Queen of Hearts over the ridiculous proceedings, eventually refusing to hold her tongue, only to say, \"It's not that I was the one who stole the tarts in the first place\", in the process. Finally, the Queen confirms that Alice was the culprit responsible of stealing the tarts after all (which automatically pardons the Knave of Hearts of his charges), and shouts, \"Off with her head!\", but Alice is unafraid, calling them just a pack of cards; although Alice holds her own for a time, the card guards soon gang up and start to swarm all over her. Alice's sister wakes her up from a dream, brushing what turns out to be some leaves and not a shower of playing cards from Alice's face. Alice leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the curious happenings for herself.\n\n== Characters ==\n{{further|List of minor characters in the Alice series}}\n\nThe main characters in ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' are the following:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]\n* [[White Rabbit|The White Rabbit]]\n* [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Mouse]]\n* [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Dodo]]\n* [[Lory (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Lory]]\n* [[Eaglet (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Eaglet]]\n* [[Duck (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Duck]]\n* [[Pat (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Pat]]\n* [[Bill the Lizard]]\n* [[The Puppy (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Puppy]]\n* [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Caterpillar]]\n* [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Duchess]]\n* [[Cheshire Cat|The Cheshire Cat]]\n* [[The Hatter|The Mad Hatter]]\n* [[March Hare|The March Hare]]\n* [[The Dormouse]]\n* [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen of Hearts]]\n* [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The King of Hearts]]\n* [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Knave of Hearts]]\n* [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Gryphon]]\n* [[Mock Turtle|The Mock Turtle]]\n}}\n\n=== Character allusions ===\n[[File:Jessie Willcox Smith Boys and Girls in Bookland.jpg|thumb|[[Jessie Willcox Smith]]'s illustration of Alice surrounded by the characters of Wonderland.

[[Leon Coward|Dr Leon Coward]] asserts the book 'suffers' from \"readings which reflect today's fascination with postmodernism and psychology, rather than delving into an historically informed interpretation,\" and speculates that this has been partly driven by audiences encountering the narrative through a 'second-hand' source, explaining \"our impressions of the original text are based on a multiplicity of reinterpretations. We don't necessarily realise we're missing anything in understanding the original product, because we're usually never dealing ''with'' the original product.\"<ref name=\"Coward 18\" />\n\n=== Language ===\nIt has been suggested by several people, including [[Martin Gardner]] and Selwyn Goodacre,<ref name=\"more_annotated\">{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Martin|url=https://archive.org/details/moreannotatedali00carr/page/363|title=More Annotated Alice|publisher=Random House|year=1990|isbn=978-0-394-58571-0|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/moreannotatedali00carr/page/363 363]}}</ref> that Dodgson had an interest in the French language, choosing to make references and puns about it in the story. It is most likely that these are references to French lessons\u2014a common feature of a Victorian middle-class girl's upbringing. For example, in the second chapter Alice posits that the mouse may be French. She therefore chooses to speak the first sentence of her French lesson-book to it: \"''O\u00f9 est ma chatte?''\" (\"Where is my cat?\"). In Henri Bu\u00e9's French translation, Alice posits that the mouse may be Italian and speaks Italian to it.\n\nPat's \"Digging for apples\" could be a [[cross-language pun]], as ''pomme de terre'' (literally; \"apple of the earth\") means potato and ''pomme'' means apple.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lewis Carroll|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V-g1dR6en90C&pg=PA264&lpg=PA264&dq=%22Digging+for+apples%22+alice+in+wonderland+potatoes#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-955829-2}}</ref>\n\nIn the second chapter, Alice initially addresses the mouse as \"O Mouse\", based on her memory of the noun [[Declension|declensions]] \"in her brother's [[Instruction in Latin#Order of cases|Latin Grammar]], 'A mouse \u2013 of a mouse \u2013 to a mouse \u2013 a mouse \u2013 O mouse!'\" These words correspond to the first five of Latin's six cases, in a traditional order established by medieval grammarians: ''mus'' ([[nominative]]), ''muris'' ([[genitive]]), ''muri'' ([[dative]]), ''murem'' ([[accusative]]), ''(O) mus'' ([[vocative]]). The sixth case, ''mure'' ([[ablative]]) is absent from Alice's recitation.\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nAs Carroll was a mathematician at Christ Church, it has been suggested that there are many references and mathematical concepts in both this story and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''.<ref name=\"more_annotated\" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Bayley|first=Melanie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/opinion/07bayley.html|title=Algebra in Wonderland|date=6 March 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=13 March 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312005347/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/opinion/07bayley.html|archivedate=12 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Literary scholar Melanie Bayley asserted in the magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'' that Dodgson wrote ''Alice in Wonderland'' in its final form as a scathing satire on new modern mathematics that were emerging in the mid-19th century.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Bayley|first=Melanie|title=Alice's adventures in algebra: Wonderland solved|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427391.600-alices-adventures-in-algebra-wonderland-solved.html?full=true|magazine=New Scientist|accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nExamples of references to mathematics in ''Alice'' include:\n\n* Chapter 1 (\"Down the Rabbit-Hole\"): in the midst of shrinking, Alice waxes philosophic concerning what final size she will end up as, perhaps \"''going out altogether, like a candle''\"; this pondering reflects the concept of a [[limit of a function|limit]].\n* Chapter 2 (\"The Pool of Tears\"): Alice tries to perform multiplication but produces some odd results: \"''Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is\u2014oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!''\" This explores the representation of numbers using different [[Base (exponentiation)|bases]] and [[Positional notation|positional]] [[numeral system]]s: 4 \u00d7 5 = 12 in base 18 notation, 4 \u00d7 6 = 13 in base 21 notation, and 4 \u00d7 7 could be 14 in base 24 notation. Continuing this sequence, going up three bases each time, the result will continue to be less than 20 in the corresponding base notation. (After 4 \u00d7 12 = 19 in Base 39, the product would be 4 \u00d7 13 = 1A in Base 42, then 1B, 1C, 1D, and so on.)\n* Chapter 7 (\"A Mad Tea-Party\"): The March Hare, the Hatter, and the Dormouse give several examples in which the semantic value of a sentence '''A''' is not the same value of the [[Antimetabole|converse]] of '''A''' (for example, \"''Why, you might just as well say that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I see'!''\"); in logic and mathematics, this is discussing a [[converse relation]]. Alice also ponders what it means when the changing of seats around the circular table places them back at the beginning. This is an observation of addition on the [[ring of integers]] [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] N.\n* The Cheshire cat fades until it disappears entirely, leaving only its wide grin, suspended in the air, leading Alice to marvel and note that she has seen a cat without a grin, but never a grin without a cat. Deep abstraction of concepts, such as non-Euclidean geometry, abstract algebra, and the beginnings of mathematical logic, was taking over mathematics at the time Dodgson was writing. Dodgson's delineation of the relationship between cat and grin can be taken to represent the very concept of mathematics and number itself. For example, instead of considering two or three apples, one may easily consider the concept of 'apple', upon which the concepts of 'two' and 'three' may seem to depend. A far more sophisticated jump is to consider the concepts of 'two' and 'three' by themselves, just like a grin, originally seemingly dependent on the cat, separated conceptually from its physical object.\n\n=== Eating and devouring ===\nCarina Garland notes how the world is \"expressed via representations of food and appetite\", naming Alice's frequent desire for consumption (of both food and words), her 'Curious Appetites'.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1353/uni.2008.0004 |title = Curious Appetites: Food, Desire, Gender and Subjectivity in Lewis Carroll's Alice Texts |journal = The Lion and the Unicorn |volume = 32 |pages = 22\u201339 |year = 2008 |last1 = Garland |first1 = C. }}</ref> Often, the idea of eating coincides to make gruesome images.

Saville Clark (book) and [[Walter Slaughter]] (music), which played at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]]. The musical was frequently revived during West End Christmas seasons during the four decades after its premiere, including a London production at the [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]] in 1888, with [[Isa Bowman]] as Alice.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Lewis Carroll in Wonderland and at Home: The Story of His Life | first=Belle | last=Moses | publisher=BiblioBazaar | year=2009 | isbn=978-1-103-29348-3 | pages=244\u2013247 }}</ref> \n\nAs the book and its sequel are Carroll's most widely recognised works, they have also inspired numerous live performances, including plays, operas, ballets, and traditional English [[pantomime]]s. These works range from fairly faithful adaptations to those that use the story as a basis for new works. An example of the latter is ''The Eighth Square'', a murder mystery set in Wonderland, written by [[Matthew Fleming]] and music and lyrics by Ben J. Macpherson. This goth-toned rock musical premiered in 2006 at the [[New Theatre Royal]] in [[Portsmouth]], England. The TA Fantastika, a popular [[Black light theatre]] in Prague performs \"Aspects of Alice\"; written and directed by Petr Kratochv\u00edl. This adaptation is not faithful to the books, but rather explores Alice's journey into adulthood while incorporating allusions to the history of Czech Republic.\n\nOver the years, many notable people in the performing arts have been involved in ''Alice'' productions. Actress [[Eva Le Gallienne]] famously adapted both Alice books for the stage in 1932; this production has been revived in New York in 1947 and 1982. One of the most well-known American productions was [[Joseph Papp]]'s 1980 staging of ''Alice in Concert'' at the [[Public Theater]] in New York City. [[Elizabeth Swados]] wrote the book, lyrics, and music. Based on both ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and ''Through the Looking-Glass'', Papp and Swados had previously produced a version of it at the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]. [[Meryl Streep]] played Alice, the White Queen, and Humpty Dumpty. The cast also included [[Debbie Allen]], [[Michael Jeter]], and [[Mark Linn-Baker]]. Performed on a bare stage with the actors in modern dress, the play is a loose adaptation, with song styles ranging the globe. A community theater production of Alice was [[Olivia de Havilland]]'s first foray onto the stage.\n\nSimilarly, the 1992 operatic production ''Alice'' used both ''Alice'' books as its inspiration. It also employs scenes with Charles Dodgson, a young Alice Liddell, and an adult Alice Liddell, to frame the story. Paul Schmidt wrote the play, with [[Tom Waits]] and [[Kathleen Brennan]] writing the music. Although the original production in [[Hamburg]], Germany, received only a small audience, Tom Waits released the songs as the album ''[[Alice (Tom Waits album)|Alice]]'' in 2002. A musical adaption was written by Michael Sirotta and Heather M. Dominick in 1997, titled ''Alice in Wonderland, a Musical Adventure''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Winter Children's Theatre \"Alice in Wonderland\" Runs Through March 24th|url=http://www.northcoastoregon.com/2013/03/12/winter-childrens-theatre-alice-in-wonderland-runs-through-march-24th/|publisher=North Coast Oregon|accessdate=9 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=First Redeemer conservatory of music and fine arts presents Alice in Wonderland|url=http://northfulton.com/stories/First-Redeemer-conservatory-of-music-and-fine-arts-presents-Alice-in-Wonderland,31808|publisher=APPEN MEDIA GROUP|accessdate=9 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nA ballet by [[Christopher Wheeldon]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2056483,00.html |work=Time |title=Royal Ballet Takes a Chance on Alice |date=3 March 2011}}</ref> and [[Nicholas Wright (playwright)|Nicholas Wright]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chesternovello.com/Default.aspx?TabId=2432&State_3041=2&workId_3041=43051 |title=Joby Talbot \u2013 Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (2010) \u2013 Music Sales Classical |publisher=Chesternovello.com |date= |accessdate=4 August 2013}}</ref> commissioned for [[The Royal Ballet]] entitled \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" premiered in February 2011 at the [[Royal Opera House]] in Covent Garden, London.

She notices a talking, clothed [[White Rabbit|white rabbit]] with a [[pocket watch]] run past. She follows it down a rabbit hole where she suddenly falls a long way to a curious hall with many locked doors of all sizes. She finds a little key to a door too small for her to fit through, but through it, she sees an attractive garden. She then discovers a bottle on a table labelled \"DRINK ME,\" the contents of which cause her to shrink too small to reach the key which she had left on the table. She subsequently eats a cake labelled \"EAT ME\" in currants as the chapter closes.\n\n'''Chapter Two \u2013 The Pool of Tears''': The chapter opens with Alice growing to such a tremendous size that her head hits the ceiling. Unhappy, Alice begins to cry and her tears literally flood the hallway. Shrinking down again due to a fan she had picked up, Alice swims through her own tears and meets a [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|mouse]], who is swimming as well. Alice, thinking he may be a French mouse, tries to make small talk with him in elementary French. Her opening gambit \"''O\u00f9 est ma chatte?''\" ({{Trans|\"Where is my cat?\"}}), however, offends the mouse, who then tries to escape her.\n\n'''Chapter Three \u2013 The Caucus Race and a Long Tale''': {{anchor|Caucus Race}}The sea of tears becomes crowded with other animals and birds that have been swept away by the rising waters. Alice and the other animals convene on the bank and the question among them is how to get dry again. Mouse gives them a very dry lecture on [[William the Conqueror]]. A [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|dodo]] decides that the best thing to dry them off would be a Caucus-Race, which consists of everyone running in a circle with no clear winner. Alice eventually frightens all the animals away, unwittingly, by talking about her (moderately ferocious) cat.\n\n'''Chapter Four \u2013 The Rabbit Sends a Little Bill''': White Rabbit appears again in search of the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]]'s gloves and fan. Mistaking her for his [[maidservant]], Mary Ann, Rabbit orders Alice to go into the house and retrieve them. Inside the house she finds another little bottle and drinks from it, immediately beginning to grow again. The horrified Rabbit orders his gardener, [[Bill the Lizard]], to climb on the roof and go down the chimney. Outside, Alice hears the voices of animals that have gathered to gawk at her giant arm. The crowd hurls pebbles at her, which turn into little cakes. Alice eats them, and they reduce her again in size.\n\n'''Chapter Five \u2013 Advice from a Caterpillar''': Alice comes upon a mushroom and sitting on it is a [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|blue caterpillar]] smoking a [[hookah]]. Caterpillar questions Alice, who begins to admit to her current identity crisis, compounded by [[How Doth the Little Crocodile|her inability to remember a poem]]. Before crawling away, the caterpillar tells Alice that one side of the mushroom will make her taller and the other side will make her shorter. She breaks off two pieces from the mushroom. One side makes her shrink smaller than ever, while another causes her neck to grow high into the trees, where a pigeon mistakes her for a serpent. With some effort, Alice brings herself back to her normal height. She stumbles upon a small estate and uses the mushroom to reach a more appropriate height.\n\n[[File:De Alice's Abenteuer im Wunderland Carroll pic 23 edited 1 of 2.png|thumb|right|The [[Cheshire Cat]]]]\n'''Chapter Six \u2013 Pig and Pepper''': A fish-[[footman]] has an invitation for the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]] of the house, which he delivers to a frog-footman. Alice observes this transaction and, after a perplexing conversation with the frog, lets herself into the house. The Duchess's cook is throwing dishes and making a soup that has too much pepper, which causes Alice, the Duchess, and her baby (but not the cook or grinning [[Cheshire Cat]]) to sneeze violently. Alice is given the baby by the Duchess and, to Alice's surprise, the baby turns into a pig. The Cheshire Cat appears in a tree, directing her to the [[March Hare]]'s house. He disappears but his grin remains behind to float on its own in the air prompting Alice to remark that she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat.\n\n'''Chapter Seven \u2013 A Mad Tea-Party''': Alice becomes a guest at a \"mad\" tea party along with the [[March Hare]], the [[The Hatter|Hatter]], and a very tired [[Dormouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dormouse]], who falls asleep frequently only to be violently awakened moments later by the March Hare and the Hatter. The characters give Alice many riddles and stories, including the famous \"[[why is a raven like a writing desk?]].\" The Hatter reveals that they have tea all day because [https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Time Time] has punished him by eternally standing still at 6&nbsp;PM (tea time). Alice becomes insulted and tired of being bombarded with riddles and she leaves claiming that it was the stupidest tea party that she had ever been to.\n\n[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 30.png|thumb|left|upright|Alice trying to play [[croquet]] with a [[Flamingo]].]]\n'''Chapter Eight \u2013 The Queen's Croquet Ground''': Alice leaves the tea party and enters the garden where she comes upon three living playing cards painting the white roses on a rose tree red because [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen of Hearts]] hates white roses. A procession of more cards, kings and queens and even the White Rabbit enters the garden. Alice then meets the King and Queen. The Queen, a figure difficult to please, introduces her signature phrase \"Off with his head!\" which she utters at the slightest dissatisfaction with a subject. Alice is invited (or some might say ordered) to play a game of croquet with the Queen and the rest of her subjects but the game quickly descends into chaos. Live flamingos are used as mallets and hedgehogs as balls and Alice once again meets the Cheshire Cat. The Queen of Hearts then orders the Cat to be beheaded, only to have her executioner complain that this is impossible since the head is all that can be seen of him. Because the cat belongs to the Duchess, the Queen is prompted to release the Duchess from prison to resolve the matter.\n\n'''Chapter Nine \u2013 The Mock Turtle's Story''': The Duchess is brought to the croquet ground at Alice's request. She ruminates on finding morals in everything around her. The Queen of Hearts dismisses her on the threat of execution and she introduces Alice to the [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Gryphon]], who takes her to the [[Mock Turtle]]. The Mock Turtle is very sad, even though he has no sorrow. He tries to tell his story about how he used to be a real turtle in school, which the Gryphon interrupts so they can play a game.\n\n{{anchor|Lobster Quadrille}}\n'''Chapter Ten \u2013 Lobster Quadrille''': The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon dance to the Lobster Quadrille, while Alice recites (rather incorrectly) \"[['Tis the Voice of the Lobster]]\". The Mock Turtle sings them \"Beautiful Soup\" during which the Gryphon drags Alice away for an impending trial.\n\n'''Chapter Eleven \u2013 Who Stole the Tarts?''': Alice attends a trial whereby the [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Knave of Hearts]] is accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The jury is composed of various animals, including [[Bill the Lizard]], the White Rabbit is the court's trumpeter, and the judge is the [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|King of Hearts]].\nDuring the proceedings, Alice finds that she is steadily growing larger. The dormouse scolds Alice and tells her she has no right to grow at such a rapid pace and take up all the air. Alice scoffs and calls the dormouse's accusation ridiculous because everyone grows and she cannot help it. Meanwhile, witnesses at the trial include the Hatter, who displeases and frustrates the King through his indirect answers to the questioning, and the Duchess's cook.\n\n'''Chapter Twelve \u2013 Alice's Evidence''': Alice is then called up as a witness. She accidentally knocks over the jury box with the animals inside them and the King orders the animals be placed back into their seats before the trial continues. The King and Queen order Alice to be gone, citing Rule 42 (\"All persons more than a mile high to leave the court\"), but Alice disputes their judgement and refuses to leave. She argues with the King and Queen of Hearts over the ridiculous proceedings, eventually refusing to hold her tongue, only to say, \"It's not that I was the one who stole the tarts in the first place\", in the process. Finally, the Queen confirms that Alice was the culprit responsible of stealing the tarts after all (which automatically pardons the Knave of Hearts of his charges), and shouts, \"Off with her head!\", but Alice is unafraid, calling them just a pack of cards; although Alice holds her own for a time, the card guards soon gang up and start to swarm all over her. Alice's sister wakes her up from a dream, brushing what turns out to be some leaves and not a shower of playing cards from Alice's face. Alice leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the curious happenings for herself.\n\n== Characters ==\n{{further|List of minor characters in the Alice series}}\n\nThe main characters in ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' are the following:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]\n* [[White Rabbit|The White Rabbit]]\n* [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Mouse]]\n* [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Dodo]]\n* [[Lory (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Lory]]\n* [[Eaglet (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Eaglet]]\n* [[Duck (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Duck]]\n* [[Pat (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Pat]]\n* [[Bill the Lizard]]\n* [[The Puppy (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Puppy]]\n* [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Caterpillar]]\n* [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Duchess]]\n* [[Cheshire Cat|The Cheshire Cat]]\n* [[The Hatter|The Mad Hatter]]\n* [[March Hare|The March Hare]]\n* [[The Dormouse]]\n* [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen of Hearts]]\n* [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The King of Hearts]]\n* [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Knave of Hearts]]\n* [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Gryphon]]\n* [[Mock Turtle|The Mock Turtle]]\n}}\n\n=== Character allusions ===\n[[File:Jessie Willcox Smith Boys and Girls in Bookland.jpg|thumb|[[Jessie Willcox Smith]]'s illustration of Alice surrounded by the characters of Wonderland.

In Henri Bu\u00e9's French translation, Alice posits that the mouse may be Italian and speaks Italian to it.\n\nPat's \"Digging for apples\" could be a [[cross-language pun]], as ''pomme de terre'' (literally; \"apple of the earth\") means potato and ''pomme'' means apple.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lewis Carroll|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V-g1dR6en90C&pg=PA264&lpg=PA264&dq=%22Digging+for+apples%22+alice+in+wonderland+potatoes#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-955829-2}}</ref>\n\nIn the second chapter, Alice initially addresses the mouse as \"O Mouse\", based on her memory of the noun [[Declension|declensions]] \"in her brother's [[Instruction in Latin#Order of cases|Latin Grammar]], 'A mouse \u2013 of a mouse \u2013 to a mouse \u2013 a mouse \u2013 O mouse!'\" These words correspond to the first five of Latin's six cases, in a traditional order established by medieval grammarians: ''mus'' ([[nominative]]), ''muris'' ([[genitive]]), ''muri'' ([[dative]]), ''murem'' ([[accusative]]), ''(O) mus'' ([[vocative]]). The sixth case, ''mure'' ([[ablative]]) is absent from Alice's recitation.\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nAs Carroll was a mathematician at Christ Church, it has been suggested that there are many references and mathematical concepts in both this story and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''.<ref name=\"more_annotated\" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Bayley|first=Melanie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/opinion/07bayley.html|title=Algebra in Wonderland|date=6 March 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=13 March 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312005347/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/opinion/07bayley.html|archivedate=12 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Literary scholar Melanie Bayley asserted in the magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'' that Dodgson wrote ''Alice in Wonderland'' in its final form as a scathing satire on new modern mathematics that were emerging in the mid-19th century.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Bayley|first=Melanie|title=Alice's adventures in algebra: Wonderland solved|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427391.600-alices-adventures-in-algebra-wonderland-solved.html?full=true|magazine=New Scientist|accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nExamples of references to mathematics in ''Alice'' include:\n\n* Chapter 1 (\"Down the Rabbit-Hole\"): in the midst of shrinking, Alice waxes philosophic concerning what final size she will end up as, perhaps \"''going out altogether, like a candle''\"; this pondering reflects the concept of a [[limit of a function|limit]].\n* Chapter 2 (\"The Pool of Tears\"): Alice tries to perform multiplication but produces some odd results: \"''Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is\u2014oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!''\" This explores the representation of numbers using different [[Base (exponentiation)|bases]] and [[Positional notation|positional]] [[numeral system]]s: 4 \u00d7 5 = 12 in base 18 notation, 4 \u00d7 6 = 13 in base 21 notation, and 4 \u00d7 7 could be 14 in base 24 notation. Continuing this sequence, going up three bases each time, the result will continue to be less than 20 in the corresponding base notation. (After 4 \u00d7 12 = 19 in Base 39, the product would be 4 \u00d7 13 = 1A in Base 42, then 1B, 1C, 1D, and so on.)\n* Chapter 7 (\"A Mad Tea-Party\"): The March Hare, the Hatter, and the Dormouse give several examples in which the semantic value of a sentence '''A''' is not the same value of the [[Antimetabole|converse]] of '''A''' (for example, \"''Why, you might just as well say that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I see'!''\"); in logic and mathematics, this is discussing a [[converse relation]]. Alice also ponders what it means when the changing of seats around the circular table places them back at the beginning. This is an observation of addition on the [[ring of integers]] [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] N.\n* The Cheshire cat fades until it disappears entirely, leaving only its wide grin, suspended in the air, leading Alice to marvel and note that she has seen a cat without a grin, but never a grin without a cat. Deep abstraction of concepts, such as non-Euclidean geometry, abstract algebra, and the beginnings of mathematical logic, was taking over mathematics at the time Dodgson was writing. Dodgson's delineation of the relationship between cat and grin can be taken to represent the very concept of mathematics and number itself. For example, instead of considering two or three apples, one may easily consider the concept of 'apple', upon which the concepts of 'two' and 'three' may seem to depend. A far more sophisticated jump is to consider the concepts of 'two' and 'three' by themselves, just like a grin, originally seemingly dependent on the cat, separated conceptually from its physical object.\n\n=== Eating and devouring ===\nCarina Garland notes how the world is \"expressed via representations of food and appetite\", naming Alice's frequent desire for consumption (of both food and words), her 'Curious Appetites'.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1353/uni.2008.0004 |title = Curious Appetites: Food, Desire, Gender and Subjectivity in Lewis Carroll's Alice Texts |journal = The Lion and the Unicorn |volume = 32 |pages = 22\u201339 |year = 2008 |last1 = Garland |first1 = C. }}</ref> Often, the idea of eating coincides to make gruesome images.

Popular among London theatregoers, the play was frequently revived during Christmas season over the next four decades.]]\n\nThe first full major production of 'Alice' books during Carroll's lifetime was ''[[Alice in Wonderland (musical)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', an 1886 [[musical theatre|musical play]] in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] by H. Saville Clark (book) and [[Walter Slaughter]] (music), which played at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]]. The musical was frequently revived during West End Christmas seasons during the four decades after its premiere, including a London production at the [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]] in 1888, with [[Isa Bowman]] as Alice.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Lewis Carroll in Wonderland and at Home: The Story of His Life | first=Belle | last=Moses | publisher=BiblioBazaar | year=2009 | isbn=978-1-103-29348-3 | pages=244\u2013247 }}</ref> \n\nAs the book and its sequel are Carroll's most widely recognised works, they have also inspired numerous live performances, including plays, operas, ballets, and traditional English [[pantomime]]s. These works range from fairly faithful adaptations to those that use the story as a basis for new works. An example of the latter is ''The Eighth Square'', a murder mystery set in Wonderland, written by [[Matthew Fleming]] and music and lyrics by Ben J. Macpherson. This goth-toned rock musical premiered in 2006 at the [[New Theatre Royal]] in [[Portsmouth]], England. The TA Fantastika, a popular [[Black light theatre]] in Prague performs \"Aspects of Alice\"; written and directed by Petr Kratochv\u00edl. This adaptation is not faithful to the books, but rather explores Alice's journey into adulthood while incorporating allusions to the history of Czech Republic.\n\nOver the years, many notable people in the performing arts have been involved in ''Alice'' productions. Actress [[Eva Le Gallienne]] famously adapted both Alice books for the stage in 1932; this production has been revived in New York in 1947 and 1982. One of the most well-known American productions was [[Joseph Papp]]'s 1980 staging of ''Alice in Concert'' at the [[Public Theater]] in New York City. [[Elizabeth Swados]] wrote the book, lyrics, and music. Based on both ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and ''Through the Looking-Glass'', Papp and Swados had previously produced a version of it at the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]. [[Meryl Streep]] played Alice, the White Queen, and Humpty Dumpty. The cast also included [[Debbie Allen]], [[Michael Jeter]], and [[Mark Linn-Baker]]. Performed on a bare stage with the actors in modern dress, the play is a loose adaptation, with song styles ranging the globe. A community theater production of Alice was [[Olivia de Havilland]]'s first foray onto the stage.\n\nSimilarly, the 1992 operatic production ''Alice'' used both ''Alice'' books as its inspiration. It also employs scenes with Charles Dodgson, a young Alice Liddell, and an adult Alice Liddell, to frame the story. Paul Schmidt wrote the play, with [[Tom Waits]] and [[Kathleen Brennan]] writing the music. Although the original production in [[Hamburg]], Germany, received only a small audience, Tom Waits released the songs as the album ''[[Alice (Tom Waits album)|Alice]]'' in 2002. A musical adaption was written by Michael Sirotta and Heather M. Dominick in 1997, titled ''Alice in Wonderland, a Musical Adventure''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Winter Children's Theatre \"Alice in Wonderland\" Runs Through March 24th|url=http://www.northcoastoregon.com/2013/03/12/winter-childrens-theatre-alice-in-wonderland-runs-through-march-24th/|publisher=North Coast Oregon|accessdate=9 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=First Redeemer conservatory of music and fine arts presents Alice in Wonderland|url=http://northfulton.com/stories/First-Redeemer-conservatory-of-music-and-fine-arts-presents-Alice-in-Wonderland,31808|publisher=APPEN MEDIA GROUP|accessdate=9 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nA ballet by [[Christopher Wheeldon]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2056483,00.html |work=Time |title=Royal Ballet Takes a Chance on Alice |date=3 March 2011}}</ref> and [[Nicholas Wright (playwright)|Nicholas Wright]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chesternovello.com/Default.aspx?TabId=2432&State_3041=2&workId_3041=43051 |title=Joby Talbot \u2013 Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (2010) \u2013 Music Sales Classical |publisher=Chesternovello.com |date= |accessdate=4 August 2013}}</ref> commissioned for [[The Royal Ballet]] entitled \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" premiered in February 2011 at the [[Royal Opera House]] in Covent Garden, London.

The company was later forced out of this market because of the invention of plastic floats. This led to a commitment by Yoneyama to never again be left behind by technological advancements.\n\nIn 1957, Yoneyama began to make badminton racquets for other brands. By 1961, the first Yoneyama-branded racquet was introduced, and within another two years an export company was created for the worldwide distribution. After the company began to make [[aluminum]] badminton racquets in 1969, it found that the same technology could be applied to the [[tennis racket]] which the company introduced in 1971. The company began to experiment with [[graphite]] shafts for both types of rackets and found that these would also be useful for golf clubs.\n\nIn 1982 Yonex came out with the new oversized tennis racquet in the REX-series with the R-7 and R-10 racquets. At that time [[Martina Navratilova]] played with the R-7 and was very successful. One year later, the new series Rexking was developed with the R-22. Navratilova subsequently used the white RQ 180 widebody frame until the early 1990s.\n\nFinding a growing market, the Yonex Corporation (a wholly owned subsidiary) was established in [[Torrance, California]] in July 1983. In 1992 Yonex introduced the widebody badminton racket, the \"Isometric 500\", a racquet that was much less \"tear drop\"-shaped than previous ones. The more \"square\" head gave it a much larger striking surface, which provides a larger \"sweet spot\" to hit the shuttle. It led other manufacturers to follow suit in \"square-head\" or [[isometry|isometric]] designs.\nThe parent company was listed on the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] in 1994. Yonex describes itself as ''the world leader in golf, tennis and badminton equipment.''<ref>[http://www.yonex.com/company/ Company profile]</ref> Yonex provides clothing for national badminton associations around the world, such as the Malaysian Badminton Association, [[Badminton Scotland]], [[Badminton England]], Badminton Ireland, and Badminton Wales.

The company was later forced out of this market because of the invention of plastic floats. This led to a commitment by Yoneyama to never again be left behind by technological advancements.\n\nIn 1957, Yoneyama began to make badminton racquets for other brands. By 1961, the first Yoneyama-branded racquet was introduced, and within another two years an export company was created for the worldwide distribution. After the company began to make [[aluminum]] badminton racquets in 1969, it found that the same technology could be applied to the [[tennis racket]] which the company introduced in 1971. The company began to experiment with [[graphite]] shafts for both types of rackets and found that these would also be useful for golf clubs.\n\nIn 1982 Yonex came out with the new oversized tennis racquet in the REX-series with the R-7 and R-10 racquets. At that time [[Martina Navratilova]] played with the R-7 and was very successful. One year later, the new series Rexking was developed with the R-22. Navratilova subsequently used the white RQ 180 widebody frame until the early 1990s.\n\nFinding a growing market, the Yonex Corporation (a wholly owned subsidiary) was established in [[Torrance, California]] in July 1983. In 1992 Yonex introduced the widebody badminton racket, the \"Isometric 500\", a racquet that was much less \"tear drop\"-shaped than previous ones. The more \"square\" head gave it a much larger striking surface, which provides a larger \"sweet spot\" to hit the shuttle. It led other manufacturers to follow suit in \"square-head\" or [[isometry|isometric]] designs.\nThe parent company was listed on the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] in 1994. Yonex describes itself as ''the world leader in golf, tennis and badminton equipment.''<ref>[http://www.yonex.com/company/ Company profile]</ref> Yonex provides clothing for national badminton associations around the world, such as the Malaysian Badminton Association, [[Badminton Scotland]], [[Badminton England]], Badminton Ireland, and Badminton Wales. Yonex has also been teaming up with OCBC (Orange County Badminton Club) since 2007 to host the annual U.S. Open Grand Prix Badminton Championships.<ref>[http://bwf.tournamentsoftware.com/find.aspx?a=7&q=B9981AAA-845D-4B32-A4DE-C269F29E1FF7 tournamentsoftware.com: Tournaments of the BWF]</ref>\n[[File:Yonex IFB 2013 - Quarterfinal - Tian Qing - Zhao Yunlei vs Misaki Matsutomo - Ayaka Takahashi 12.jpg|thumb|Yonex French Open in 2013]]\nYonex has become the dominant corporate player in badminton.

The '''founding members''' were Englishmen Roye Albrighton on guitars and lead vocals, Allan \"Taff\" Freeman on keyboards, Derek \"Mo\" Moore on bass, Ron Howden on drums and Mick Brockett on lights and \"special effects\" Mick also wrote lyrics with the band. Keith Walters assisted Mick with his show, but the show was Micks. Though the concept of non-performing bandmembers was not unprecedented (e.g. lyricist Keith Reid in [[Procol Harum]]), it was considered unusual that a fifth of Nektar's lineup had no recognized role in performing or writing their music. Throughout their early existence the band's songwriting was credited to \"Nektar\" on the album sleeves, but BMI records show that the music was written by the four performing members (Albrighton, Freeman, Moore and Howden). Mick Brockett did however co-write the lyrics with \"Mo\" Moore, and invented or contributed to all of the original album titles.\n\nThe band's debut album, ''[[Journey to the Centre of the Eye]]'' (1971), consisted of a single song running over 40 minutes, with the last 100 seconds of the first side repeated at the beginning of the second side to maintain continuity. It was a [[concept album]], following an astronaut who is given overwhelming knowledge by [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]]s, with sonic textures reminiscent of [[psychedelic rock]]. The follow-up, ''[[A Tab in the Ocean]]'' (1972), drew on more conventional rock and blues influences. Walters had left by the time of their third album, the heavily improvised live-in-the-studio double LP ''[[...Sounds Like This]]'' (1973), though the band would continue to use his art in their shows and album designs for a time. A cult following grew for the band, based largely on word of mouth.\n\n==Success==\nNektar's U.S. release, ''[[Remember the Future]]'' (1973), propelled the band briefly into mass popularity. A concept album revisiting ''Journey to the Centre of the Eye''{{'}}s theme of extraterrestrials granting a human enlightenment, but with a [[blindness|blind]] boy as the protagonist. It demonstrated a much more melodic sound than previous albums and shot into the Top 20 album charts in the U.S.. The follow-up, ''[[Down to Earth (Nektar album)|Down to Earth]]'' (1974), was another concept album (this time with a [[circus (performing art)|circus]] theme); it also sold well, breaking into the Top 40 album charts and including their only song to chart on the Billboard singles charts, \"Astral Man\". The next album, ''[[Recycled (album)|Recycled]]'' (1975), was stylistically close to bands like [[Gentle Giant]] and carried on the band's close connection with progressive rock.\n\nAlbrighton left the band in December 1976, just prior to the studio sessions for Nektar's first major-label release, ''[[Magic Is a Child]]'' (1977). The remaining members were joined by guitarist/vocalist Dave Nelson at this point. The album was more eclectic, although with shorter songs and fairly straightforward rhythms. Lyrically the album covered a wide range of subjects from [[Norse mythology]] and [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] to more down to earth subjects like [[Rail transport|railroads]] and truck drivers. In 1978 the band dissolved; however in 1979 Albrighton and Freeman reformed the band with bassist [[Carmine Rojas]] and drummer Dave Prater and released a new album, ''[[Man in the Moon (Nektar album)|Man in the Moon]]'' (1980), before the band dissolved once again in 1982.\n\n==Reformation==\nNektar regrouped in 2000 with a line-up consisting of Albrighton, Freeman, and drummer Ray Hardwick; and released a new album titled ''[[The Prodigal Son (Nektar album)|The Prodigal Son]]''. The following year, the band headlined [[NEARfest]] (opposite [[Steve Hackett]]) with the full classic line-up including Mo Moore on bass, Ron Howden on drums and [[Larry Fast]] (who played on [[Recycled_(Nektar_album)|Recycled]]) again guesting on synthesizers.<ref>{{cite web|title=NEARfest Official Facebook Page|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/nearfest/nearfest-2002/1379311842101617/|work=NEARfest Archives|accessdate=10 January 2019}}</ref> In 2003, Moore departed the band and was replaced by new bassist Randy Dembo. Nektar cut one more album, ''[[Evolution (Nektar album)|Evolution]]'', before Freeman was replaced by Tom Hughes. Dembo and Hughes left in August 2006, citing communication problems, money issues, personality issues and trust in the management issues. Dembo was briefly replaced by a returning Carmine Rojas, before the band settled on a line-up that consisted of Albrighton, Howden, guitarist Steve Adams, bassist Desha Dunnahoe, and keyboardist Steve Mattern. However, this line up never appeared live on stage in public.\n\nLater in 2006, the band found new management in Roy Clay to replace The Eclectic Records staff, playing \"Prog fests\" around the globe on a part-time basis, and occasionally appearing in some of their old haunts in the New Jersey/New York area. Clay was subsequently released from management duties early 2007 after a dispute over financial matters. The band made an official complaint which exposed further fraudulent acts. Clay was ultimately convicted for fraud, lying and forgery, and was jailed for 2 years and 11 months.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://slides.com/jameskaan/roy-clay-music-producer-jailed#/ |title=Music Producer's \u00a3170,000 Swindle |last=Naylor |first=Mark |date=18 April 2011 |publisher=[[Grimsby Telegraph]]}}</ref>\n\nIn mid-2007, a solo tour was undertaken by Albrighton. A full band tour of Europe (primarily Germany) was scheduled by a European-based promoter, but they had to postpone as extra funds were needed to complete the new album, ''[[Book of Days (Nektar album)|Book of Days]]'', which was not released until the following year, by which time Adams, Dunnahoe, and Mattern had departed the band. ''Book of Days'' featured more of Roye Albrighton's guitar work than previous Nektar albums as all of the instruments were played by Roye at his home studio.<ref>{{cite web|title=27-Apr-2008 interview with Roye Albrighton on Outsight Radio Hours|url=https://archive.org/details/OutsightRadioHoursInterviewsIi|work=Archive.org|accessdate=15 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2007, the band embarked on a tour for which they performed ''Remember the Future'' in its entirety, the line-up now including Klaus Henatsch on keyboards and Peter Pichl on bass. In this formation they toured extensively through Europe in 2008. These concerts resulted in the highly acclaimed live double CD album \"Fortyfied\", which was released in 2009 under Roye's own \"Treacle Music\" label. In 2009, the band also played their first gig in the USA again, appearing as headliners at the legendary \"Rites Of Spring\" festival and a week-long tour along the eastcoast.\n\nIn mid 2011, Lux Vibratus joined the band on bass for the Cleopatra records 'Space Rock Invasion Tour' in the U.S.<ref name=members>{{cite web|title=The Current Band Members |url=http://nektarsmusic.com/nn/band/band_current.asp|website=Nektar: The Official Website|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref> By the time the band came to record the [[covers album]] ''A Spoonful of Time'' (2012), bass duties were shared by session musician J\u00fcrgen Engler, [[Mr. Big (American band)|Mr. Big]] bassist [[Billy Sheehan]], and [[Yes (band)|Yes]] member [[Billy Sherwood]], who also served as the album's producer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Nektar-A-Spoonful-Of-Time/release/4108523 |title=Nektar - A Spoonful Of Time (CD, Album) |website=Discogs.com |date=2012-11-02 |accessdate=2016-08-03}}</ref> The Albrighton-Howden-Henatsch-Sherwood line-up recorded and released the album ''Time Machine''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Nektar-Time-Machine/release/5389903 |title=Nektar - Time Machine (Vinyl, LP, Album) |website=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-03}}</ref> A special post-recording show was put together at the Coach House in South Orange County, California. Returning to Nektar in 2013, Lux Vibratus was on bass for the Cruise To The Edge event, followed by The Virada Cultural Festival in Sao Paulo, Brazil. In June, this line-up went on the road again for a U.S. tour billed as the 'U.K. Legends of Classic Rock'.<ref name=members/><ref>[http://www.thenektarproject.com/geewiz/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=164&title=2013-2014-tour-dates]</ref> In Jan.2014 bassist Tom Fry joined the band for a European tour. On this tour Che Albrighton, Ron's son, made his first appearance as a drummer because Howden had a different engagement. Che had previously worked as tour manager for Nektar on several tours.\n\nOn 26 July 2016, Roye Albrighton died after an unspecified illness, at the age of 67.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://bravewords.com/news/legendary-nektar-frontman-roye-albrighton-passes |title=Legendary NEKTAR Frontman Roye Albrighton Passes |website=Bravewords.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-03}}</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Roye Albrighton, Klaus Henatsch (Keys), Ron Howden (Drums) and Tom Fry (Bass) decided to move on with the production of a new album with On Stage Records, the label they worked with since 2015. First release under this label the Live CD double album \" Live In Bremen\". Also highly regarded and appreciated because it documents the last tour with Roye Albrighton. Later also released as triple vinyl album. For this new beginning of Nektar Alexander Hoffmeister has been asked to follow the footsteps of his idol and friend Roye Albrighton. After an audition in 2017, Klaus Henatsch, Ron Howden and Tom Fry were willing to continue the tradition of Nektar with Alexander Hoffmeister as new front singer and guitar player.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://nektarband.com/story.php |title=The Story of NEKTAR |website=Bravewords.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-03}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2018 Ron Howden (Drums) decided to leave the formation because of Klaus Henatsch's insistence that he would be musical director which Ron found not acceptable. As a founder member he felt the band was not going in the direction he wanted it to go and felt he had the right as founder member to determine that direction.  He left to found his own Nektar contribution in the US and approached Derek \u201eMo\u201c Moore about joining his Nektar band and helping him put together a true Nektar. When Moore agreed, Mo approached former members Randy Dembo (Bass and 12-string), Founding member Mick Brockett (Lights, projections and atmosphere), and Ryche Chlanda (Guitar and vocals) were soon signed on. To fill the keyboards slot, Kendall Scott, the keyboard player of Ryche's band Flying Dreams and a friend of Chlanda's was brought aboard. \n\nThese circumstances lead to the current state, that there are two formations following the name \"Nektar\", the true one based in the USA and one based in Germany calling itself New Nektar which was acceptable to the original members. The German formation decided to release their concept album \"Megalomania\" in 2018 using the name \"New Nektar\". To fill the gap Ron Howden had left they asked Che Albrighton, the son of Roye Albrighton, to record the drums for \"Megalomania\". When the band played their Megalomania Release Tour in December 2018 Che was busy playing with [[Jamie Lawson (musician)|Jamie Lawson]], so Norbert \"Panza\" Lehmann joined the band. The USA line up collected a set of never formally recorded songs from Chlanda's previous time in the band, and began rehearsals and recordings for a new album to be titled \"The Other Side\". That album has been released in January 2020 under the name \"Nektar\".<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.regioactive.de/review/2020/01/11/new-nektar-zeigen-im-cafe-central-in-weinheim-zwei-seiten-QFy7ncQSry.php |title=Concert Review of NEKTAR |website=regioactive.de}}</ref>  At this point the manager of the band New Nektar decided to register the name Nektar for Germany in an attempt to steal the name from the original band.  They successfully blocked Nektar from releasing their album \"The Other Side\" in Germany and made it impossible for the real Nektar to tour Europe.  They also registered the Logo and the Nektarman which is the intellectual property of Mick brocket (Logo) and Helmut Wenske who painted the Nektarman for the original Nektar to use as their tour poster in 1971\n\n==Personnel==\n;Current members of Nektar\nUSA:\n*Ron Howden \u2013 drums, percussion, backing vocals <small>(1969\u20131978, 2003\u20132016, 2019\u2013present)</small>\n*Derek \"Mo\" Moore \u2013 bass, keyboards, vocals and lyrics <small>(1969\u20131978, 2002\u20132003, 2019\u2013present)</small>\n*Mick Brockett \u2013 visual interpretation and Lyricss <small>(1969\u20131977, 2002, 2019\u2013present)</small>\n*Ryche Chlanda \u2013 guitars, vocals <small>(1978, 2019\u2013present)</small>\n*Randy Dembo \u2013 bass, bass pedals, backing vocals <small>(2003\u20132006, 2019\u2013present)</small>\n*Kendall Scott \u2013 keyboards <small>(2019\u2013present)</small>\n\nGERMANY:current members of New Nektar\n* Klaus Henatsch \u2013 keyboards, backing vocals <small>(2007\u2013present)</small>\n* Alexander Hoffmeister \u2013 vocals, guitars <small>(2017\u2013present)</small>\n* Norbert \"Panza\" Lehmann \u2013 drums, backing vocals <small>(2018\u2013present)</small>\n* Heike Nolden \u2013 bass, violin, backing vocals <small>(2019\u2013present)</small>\n\n'''Founding Members'''\n*Ron Howden \u2013 drums, percussion, backing vocals <small>(1969\u20131978, 2003\u20132016, 2019\u2013present)</small>\n*Derek \"Mo\" Moore \u2013 bass, keyboards, vocals and lyrics <small>(1969\u20131978, 2002\u20132003, 2019\u2013present)</small>\n*Mick Brockett \u2013 visual interpretation and Lyricss <small>(1969\u20131977, 2002, 2019\u2013present)</small>\n*Roye Albrighton \u2013 guitars, bass, lead vocals <small>(1969\u20131976, 1978, 1979\u20131982, 2000\u20132016; his death)</small>\n*Allan \"Taff\" Freeman \u2013 keyboards, synthesisers, backing vocals <small>(1969\u20131978, 1979\u20131980, 2000\u20132004)</small>\n\n;Former members and side men\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n*Roye Albrighton \u2013 guitars, bass, lead vocals <small>(1969\u20131976, 1978, 1979\u20131982, 2000\u20132016; his death)</small>\n*Allan \"Taff\" Freeman \u2013 keyboards, synthesisers, backing vocals <small>(1969\u20131978, 1979\u20131980, 2000\u20132004)</small>\n*Keith Walters \u2013 special effects <small>(1969\u20131972)</small>\n*[[Larry Fast]] \u2013 synthesisers <small>(1975\u20131978, 2002\u20132003)</small>\n*Dave Nelson \u2013 guitars, lead vocals <small>(1976\u20131978)</small>\n*Dave Prater \u2013 drums, percussion, backing vocals <small>(1979\u20131982)</small>\n*[[Carmine Rojas]] \u2013 bass, backing vocals <small>(1979\u20131982, 2006)</small>\n*Tommi Schmidt \u2013 keyboards, backing vocals <small>(1980\u20131982)</small>\n{{col-2}}\n*Ray Hardwick \u2013 drums, percussion <small>(2000\u20132003)</small>\n*Scott Krentz \u2013 percussion, vocals <small>(2002)</small>\n*Tom Hughes \u2013 keyboards, backing vocals <small>(2004\u20132006)</small>\n*Steve Adams \u2013 guitars, backing vocals <small>(2006\u20132007)</small>\n*Desha Dunnahoe \u2013 bass, backing vocals <small>(2006\u20132007)</small>\n*Steve Mattern \u2013 keyboards <small>(2006\u20132007)</small>\n*Peter Pichl \u2013 bass <small>(2007\u20132011)</small>\n*Lux Vibratus \u2013 bass <small>(2011\u20132014)</small><ref name=members/>\n*Klaus Henatsch \u2013 keyboards, backing vocals\n*Tom Fry \u2013 bass <small>(2014\u20132019)</small><ref name=members/>\n*[[Billy Sherwood]] \u2013 bass <small>(2018)</small>\n*Che Albrighton \u2013 drums <small>(2014, 2018)</small><ref name=members/>\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Line-ups===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\"  style=\"float:width:375px; margin:0 0 1em 1em; border-collapse:collapse; border:1px solid #e2e2e2; width:99%;\"\n|-\n!

The '''founding members''' were Englishmen Roye Albrighton on guitars and lead vocals, Allan \"Taff\" Freeman on keyboards, Derek \"Mo\" Moore on bass, Ron Howden on drums and Mick Brockett on lights and \"special effects\" Mick also wrote lyrics with the band. Keith Walters assisted Mick with his show, but the show was Micks. Though the concept of non-performing bandmembers was not unprecedented (e.g. lyricist Keith Reid in [[Procol Harum]]), it was considered unusual that a fifth of Nektar's lineup had no recognized role in performing or writing their music. Throughout their early existence the band's songwriting was credited to \"Nektar\" on the album sleeves, but BMI records show that the music was written by the four performing members (Albrighton, Freeman, Moore and Howden). Mick Brockett did however co-write the lyrics with \"Mo\" Moore, and invented or contributed to all of the original album titles.\n\nThe band's debut album, ''[[Journey to the Centre of the Eye]]'' (1971), consisted of a single song running over 40 minutes, with the last 100 seconds of the first side repeated at the beginning of the second side to maintain continuity. It was a [[concept album]], following an astronaut who is given overwhelming knowledge by [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]]s, with sonic textures reminiscent of [[psychedelic rock]]. The follow-up, ''[[A Tab in the Ocean]]'' (1972), drew on more conventional rock and blues influences. Walters had left by the time of their third album, the heavily improvised live-in-the-studio double LP ''[[...Sounds Like This]]'' (1973), though the band would continue to use his art in their shows and album designs for a time. A cult following grew for the band, based largely on word of mouth.\n\n==Success==\nNektar's U.S. release, ''[[Remember the Future]]'' (1973), propelled the band briefly into mass popularity. A concept album revisiting ''Journey to the Centre of the Eye''{{'}}s theme of extraterrestrials granting a human enlightenment, but with a [[blindness|blind]] boy as the protagonist. It demonstrated a much more melodic sound than previous albums and shot into the Top 20 album charts in the U.S.. The follow-up, ''[[Down to Earth (Nektar album)|Down to Earth]]'' (1974), was another concept album (this time with a [[circus (performing art)|circus]] theme); it also sold well, breaking into the Top 40 album charts and including their only song to chart on the Billboard singles charts, \"Astral Man\". The next album, ''[[Recycled (album)|Recycled]]'' (1975), was stylistically close to bands like [[Gentle Giant]] and carried on the band's close connection with progressive rock.\n\nAlbrighton left the band in December 1976, just prior to the studio sessions for Nektar's first major-label release, ''[[Magic Is a Child]]'' (1977). The remaining members were joined by guitarist/vocalist Dave Nelson at this point. The album was more eclectic, although with shorter songs and fairly straightforward rhythms. Lyrically the album covered a wide range of subjects from [[Norse mythology]] and [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] to more down to earth subjects like [[Rail transport|railroads]] and truck drivers. In 1978 the band dissolved; however in 1979 Albrighton and Freeman reformed the band with bassist [[Carmine Rojas]] and drummer Dave Prater and released a new album, ''[[Man in the Moon (Nektar album)|Man in the Moon]]'' (1980), before the band dissolved once again in 1982.\n\n==Reformation==\nNektar regrouped in 2000 with a line-up consisting of Albrighton, Freeman, and drummer Ray Hardwick; and released a new album titled ''[[The Prodigal Son (Nektar album)|The Prodigal Son]]''. The following year, the band headlined [[NEARfest]] (opposite [[Steve Hackett]]) with the full classic line-up including Mo Moore on bass, Ron Howden on drums and [[Larry Fast]] (who played on [[Recycled_(Nektar_album)|Recycled]]) again guesting on synthesizers<ref>{{cite web|title=NEARfest Official Facebook Page|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/nearfest/nearfest-2002/1379311842101617/|work=NEARfest Archives|accessdate=10 January 2019}}</ref>. In 2003, Moore departed the band and was replaced by new bassist Randy Dembo. Nektar cut one more album, ''[[Evolution (Nektar album)|Evolution]]'', before Freeman was replaced by Tom Hughes. Dembo and Hughes left in August 2006, citing communication problems, money issues, personality issues and trust in the management issues. Dembo was briefly replaced by a returning Carmine Rojas, before the band settled on a line-up that consisted of Albrighton, Howden, guitarist Steve Adams, bassist Desha Dunnahoe, and keyboardist Steve Mattern. However, this line up never appeared live on stage in public.\n\nLater in 2006, the band found new management in Roy Clay to replace The Eclectic Records staff, playing \"Prog fests\" around the globe on a part-time basis, and occasionally appearing in some of their old haunts in the New Jersey/New York area. Clay was subsequently released from management duties early 2007 after a dispute over financial matters. The band made an official complaint which exposed further fraudulent acts. Clay was ultimately convicted for fraud, lying and forgery, and was jailed for 2 years and 11 months.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://slides.com/jameskaan/roy-clay-music-producer-jailed#/ |title=Music Producer's \u00a3170,000 Swindle |last=Naylor |first=Mark |date=18 April 2011 |publisher=[[Grimsby Telegraph]]}}</ref>\n\nIn mid-2007, a solo tour was undertaken by Albrighton. A full band tour of Europe (primarily Germany) was scheduled by a European-based promoter, but they had to postpone as extra funds were needed to complete the new album, ''[[Book of Days (Nektar album)|Book of Days]]'', which was not released until the following year, by which time Adams, Dunnahoe, and Mattern had departed the band. ''Book of Days'' featured more of Roye Albrighton's guitar work than previous Nektar albums as all of the instruments were played by Roye at his home studio.<ref>{{cite web|title=27-Apr-2008 interview with Roye Albrighton on Outsight Radio Hours|url=https://archive.org/details/OutsightRadioHoursInterviewsIi|work=Archive.org|accessdate=15 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2007, the band embarked on a tour for which they performed ''Remember the Future'' in its entirety, the line-up now including Klaus Henatsch on keyboards and Peter Pichl on bass. In this formation they toured extensively through Europe in 2008. These concerts resulted in the highly acclaimed live double CD album \"Fortyfied\", which was released in 2009 under Roye's own \"Treacle Music\" label. In 2009, the band also played their first gig in the USA again, appearing as headliners at the legendary \"Rites Of Spring\" festival and a week-long tour along the eastcoast.\n\nIn mid 2011, Lux Vibratus joined the band on bass for the Cleopatra records 'Space Rock Invasion Tour' in the U.S.<ref name=members>{{cite web|title=The Current Band Members |url=http://nektarsmusic.com/nn/band/band_current.asp|website=Nektar: The Official Website|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref> By the time the band came to record the [[covers album]] ''A Spoonful of Time'' (2012), bass duties were shared by session musician J\u00fcrgen Engler, [[Mr. Big (American band)|Mr. Big]] bassist [[Billy Sheehan]], and [[Yes (band)|Yes]] member [[Billy Sherwood]], who also served as the album's producer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Nektar-A-Spoonful-Of-Time/release/4108523 |title=Nektar - A Spoonful Of Time (CD, Album) |website=Discogs.com |date=2012-11-02 |accessdate=2016-08-03}}</ref> The Albrighton-Howden-Henatsch-Sherwood line-up recorded and released the album ''Time Machine''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Nektar-Time-Machine/release/5389903 |title=Nektar - Time Machine (Vinyl, LP, Album) |website=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-03}}</ref> A special post-recording show was put together at the Coach House in South Orange County, California. Returning to Nektar in 2013, Lux Vibratus was on bass for the Cruise To The Edge event, followed by The Virada Cultural Festival in Sao Paulo, Brazil. In June, this line-up went on the road again for a U.S. tour billed as the 'U.K. Legends of Classic Rock'.<ref name=members/><ref>[http://www.thenektarproject.com/geewiz/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=164&title=2013-2014-tour-dates]</ref> In Jan.2014 bassist Tom Fry joined the band for a European tour. On this tour Che Albrighton, Ron's son, made his first appearance as a drummer because Howden had a different engagement. Che had previously worked as tour manager for Nektar on several tours.\n\nOn 26 July 2016, Roye Albrighton died after an unspecified illness, at the age of 67.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://bravewords.com/news/legendary-nektar-frontman-roye-albrighton-passes |title=Legendary NEKTAR Frontman Roye Albrighton Passes |website=Bravewords.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-03}}</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Roye Albrighton, Klaus Henatsch (Keys), Ron Howden (Drums) and Tom Fry (Bass) decided to move on with the production of a new album with On Stage Records, the label they worked with since 2015. First release under this label the Live CD double album \" Live In Bremen\". Also highly regarded and appreciated because it documents the last tour with Roye Albrighton. Later also released as triple vinyl album. For this new beginning of Nektar Alexander Hoffmeister has been asked to follow the footsteps of his idol and friend Roye Albrighton. After an audition in 2017, Klaus Henatsch, Ron Howden and Tom Fry were willing to continue the tradition of Nektar with Alexander Hoffmeister as new front singer and guitar player.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://nektarband.com/story.php |title=The Story of NEKTAR |website=Bravewords.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-03}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2018 Ron Howden (Drums) decided to leave the formation because of Klaus Henatsch's insistence that he would be musical director which Ron found not acceptable. As a founder member he felt the band was not going in the direction he wanted it to go and felt he had the right as founder member to determine that direction.  He left to found his own Nektar contribution in the US and approached Derek \u201eMo\u201c Moore about joining his Nektar band and helping him put together a true Nektar. When Moore agreed, Mo approached former members Randy Dembo (Bass and 12-string), Founding member Mick Brockett (Lights, projections and atmosphere), and Ryche Chlanda (Guitar and vocals) were soon signed on. To fill the keyboards slot, Kendall Scott, the keyboard player of Ryche's band Flying Dreams and a friend of Chlanda's was brought aboard. \n\nThese circumstances lead to the current state, that there are two formations following the name \"Nektar\", the true one based in the USA and one based in Germany calling itself New Nektar which was acceptable to the original members. The German formation decided to release their concept album \"Megalomania\" in 2018 using the name \"New Nektar\". To fill the gap Ron Howden had left they asked Che Albrighton, the son of Roye Albrighton, to record the drums for \"Megalomania\". When the band played their Megalomania Release Tour in December 2018 Che was busy playing with [[Jamie Lawson (musician)|Jamie Lawson]], so Norbert \"Panza\" Lehmann joined the band. The USA line up collected a set of never formally recorded songs from Chlanda's previous time in the band, and began rehearsals and recordings for a new album to be titled \"The Other Side\". That album has been released in January 2020 under the name \"Nektar\".<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.regioactive.de/review/2020/01/11/new-nektar-zeigen-im-cafe-central-in-weinheim-zwei-seiten-QFy7ncQSry.php |title=Concert Review of NEKTAR |website=regioactive.de}}</ref>  At this point the manager of the band New Nektar decided to register the name Nektar for Germany in an attempt to steal the name from the original band.  They successfully blocked Nektar from releasing their album \"The Other Side\" in Germany and made it impossible for the real Nektar to tour Europe.  They also registered the Logo and the Nektarman which is the intellectual property of Mick brocket (Logo) and Helmut Wenske who painted the Nektarman for the original Nektar to use as their tour poster in 1971\n\n==Personnel==\n;Current members of Nektar\nUSA:\n*Ron Howden - drums, percussion, backing vocals <small>(1969-1978, 2003-2016, 2019 -)</small>\n*Derek \"Mo\" Moore - bass, keyboards, vocals and lyrics <small>(1969-1978, 2002-2003, 2019 -)</small>\n*Mick Brockett - visual interpretation and Lyricss <small>(1969-1977, 2002, 2019 -)</small>\n*Ryche Chlanda - guitars, vocals <small>(1978, 2019 -)</small>\n*Randy Dembo - bass, bass pedals, backing vocals <small>(2003-2006, 2019 -)</small>\n*Kendall Scott - keyboards <small>(2019 -)</small>\n\nGERMANY:current members of New Nektar\n* Klaus Henatsch - keyboards, backing vocals <small>(2007 -)</small>\n* Alexander Hoffmeister - vocals, guitars <small>(2017 -)</small>\n* Norbert \"Panza\" Lehmann - drums, backing vocals <small>(2018 -)</small>\n* Heike Nolden - bass, violin, backing vocals <small>(2019 -)</small>\n\n'''Founding Members'''\n*Ron Howden - drums, percussion, backing vocals <small>(1969-1978, 2003-2016, 2019 -)</small>\n*Derek \"Mo\" Moore - bass, keyboards, vocals and lyrics <small>(1969-1978, 2002-2003, 2019 -)</small>\n*Mick Brockett - visual interpretation and Lyricss <small>(1969-1977, 2002, 2019 -)</small>\n*Roye Albrighton - guitars, bass, lead vocals <small>(1969-1976, 1978, 1979-1982, 2000-2016; his death)</small>\n*Allan \"Taff\" Freeman - keyboards, synthesisers, backing vocals <small>(1969-1978, 1979-1980, 2000-2004)</small>\n\n;Former members and side men\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n*Roye Albrighton - guitars, bass, lead vocals <small>(1969-1976, 1978, 1979-1982, 2000-2016; his death)</small>\n*Allan \"Taff\" Freeman - keyboards, synthesisers, backing vocals <small>(1969-1978, 1979-1980, 2000-2004)</small>\n*Keith Walters - special effects <small>(1969-1972)</small>\n*[[Larry Fast]] - synthesisers <small>(1975-1978, 2002-2003)</small>\n*Dave Nelson - guitars, lead vocals <small>(1976-1978)</small>\n*Dave Prater - drums, percussion, backing vocals <small>(1979-1982)</small>\n*[[Carmine Rojas]] - bass, backing vocals <small>(1979-1982, 2006)</small>\n*Tommi Schmidt - keyboards, backing vocals <small>(1980-1982)</small>\n{{col-2}}\n*Ray Hardwick - drums, percussion <small>(2000-2003)</small>\n*Scott Krentz - percussion, vocals <small>(2002)</small>\n*Tom Hughes - keyboards, backing vocals <small>(2004-2006)</small>\n*Steve Adams - guitars, backing vocals <small>(2006-2007)</small>\n*Desha Dunnahoe - bass, backing vocals <small>(2006-2007)</small>\n*Steve Mattern - keyboards <small>(2006-2007)</small>\n*Peter Pichl - bass <small>(2007-2011)</small>\n*Lux Vibratus - bass <small>(2011-2014)</small><ref name=members/>\n*Klaus Henatsch - keyboards, backing vocals\n*Tom Fry - bass <small>(2014-2019)</small><ref name=members/>\n*[[Billy Sherwood]] - bass <small>(2018)</small>\n*Che Albrighton - drums <small>(2014, 2018)</small><ref name=members/>\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Line-ups===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\"  style=\"float:width:375px; margin:0 0 1em 1em; border-collapse:collapse; border:1px solid #e2e2e2; width:99%;\"\n|-\n!

R. R. Tolkien]]'s writings. It was a large island in the Sundering Seas to the west of [[Middle-earth]], the main setting of Tolkien's writings, and was the greatest civilization of [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]]. However, after centuries of prosperity many of the inhabitants ceased to worship the One God, [[Eru Il\u00favatar]], and rebelled against the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]], resulting in the destruction of the island and the death of most of its people. Tolkien intended N\u00famenor to allude to the legendary [[Atlantis]].<ref group=T>''Letters'', ##154, 156, 227.</ref>\n\nN\u00famenor first appeared in print in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set thousands of years after N\u00famenor's destruction. Within ''The Lord of the Rings'', N\u00famenor looms as a fabulous [[Lost city (fiction)|lost civilization]].\n\nAn unfinished story, ''[[Aldarion and Erendis]]'', is set in N\u00famenor at its [[zenith]]; another, ''[[Akallab\u00eath]]'', summarizes its downfall. The appendices to ''The Lord of the Rings'' and several accounts published in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' and ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' series also touch upon it.\n\nOriginally intended to be a part of a time-travel story, Tolkien once saw the tale of the fall of N\u00famenor as a conclusion to his ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and the \"last tale\" about the Elder Days.<ref name=\"LR1\" group=T>''Lost Road'', \"The early history of the legend\", pp. 7\u201310.</ref> Later, with the emergence of ''The Lord of the Rings'', it became the link between these two works and a major part of his [[Tolkien's legendarium|legendarium]].\n\n==Literature==\n===History===\n\n====Land of Gift====\n\nThe island of N\u00famenor was raised from the sea as a gift from the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]] to the [[Edain]], the Fathers of Men who had stood with the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] of [[Beleriand]] against [[Morgoth]] in the wars of the [[First Age]].

Under his rule, and those of his descendants, the N\u00famen\u00f3reans rose to become a powerful people, friendly with Elves, both of [[Eress\u00eba]] and of Middle-earth. The Elves of Eress\u00eba brought gifts  including skills and wonderful plants. Among these gifts were seven ''[[palant\u00edri]]'', magical orbs that could foresee the future, for the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb.\n\n====Sea-kings====\nN\u00famenor was surrounded by the sea: the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] of [[Arda (Tolkien)|Arda]], and the sea had a profound influence on N\u00famenor's culture and history. From the earliest times in its history, [[Fish as food|fish]] from the sea were a significant part of N\u00famen\u00f3rean diet; those providing this food were N\u00famenor's first sea-farers.<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 2 ch. 1 \"A Description of the Island of Numenor\"</ref> The N\u00famen\u00f3reans swiftly became skilled [[Shipbuilding|shipbuilders]] and [[Seafaring|mariners]], with a desire to explore and master the ocean. There was one limitation on this activity: the Ban of the Valar. When the island of N\u00famenor had been gifted to the Edain, they were strictly \"forbidden to sail west out of sight\" of the island. This was because the [[Undying Lands]], forbidden to mortals, lay tantalizingly not far west of N\u00famenor.\n\nSo the N\u00famen\u00f3reans began exploring the seas to the north, east and south. In {{ME-date|SA|600}} they reached [[Middle-earth]] to the east, and explored its coasts; eventually they reached the Eastern Sea on the far side of Middle-earth. The N\u00famen\u00f3reans brought the gifts of their superior civilization to the Men of Middle-earth, who called the N\u00famen\u00f3reans the Sea-kings.<ref name=\"R.

He established Vinyalond\u00eb (later called [[Lond Daer]]), the first N\u00famen\u00f3rean settlement in Middle-earth. This port provided access to the great forests of [[Eriador]], which the N\u00famen\u00f3reans needed for ship-building.\n\nBetween {{ME-date|SA|1693}}-1701, the N\u00famen\u00f3reans assisted Gil-galad in Middle-earth's War of the Elves and Sauron, which broke out after the forging of the [[Rings of Power]], in particular the [[One Ring]]. Tar-Minastir, later<ref group=T>Most of Tolkien's writings on the event refer to \"Tar-Minastir\", indicating he was the king at the time. However one of Tolkien's writings, 'The Line of Elros', states that Minastir did not become king until S.A. 1731. The discrepancy is noted in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 2 ch. 3 \"The Line of Elros\", note 9</ref> the eleventh King of N\u00famenor, assembled an armada, and sent it to Gil-galad's aid. The forces of N\u00famenor were without peer in war, and together with the Elves, they were able to temporarily defeat Sauron.\n\n====The Shadow looms====\nThe increasing power of the N\u00famen\u00f3reans had a dark side; the exploitation of Middle-earth's forests had devastated large regions of Eriador. The N\u00famen\u00f3reans established further settlements in Middle-earth, coming to to rule a coastal empire with no rival. At first they had engaged with the Men of Middle-earth in a friendly manner, but Minastir's successors, Tar-Ciryatan (ruled {{Me-date|SA|1869}}-2029) and Tar-Atanamir 'the Great' (2029-2221), became increasingly tyrannical, oppressing the Men of Middle-earth and exacting heavy tribute.\nIn {{ME-date|SA|2280}} the N\u00famen\u00f3reans made [[Umbar]], the harbour-city in [[Harad|the south]] of Middle-earth, into a great fortress. In S.A. 2350 they greatly expanded [[Pelargir]], a landing in [[Gondor]] near the Mouths of the [[Anduin]]. \n\nIncreasing numbers of N\u00famen\u00f3reans became jealous of Elves for their immortality, resenting the Ban of the Valar, and sought everlasting life. Those of this persuasion were the faction of \"King's Men\". \n\nThose who remained loyal to the Valar and friendly to the Elves (and using Elvish languages) were the \"Faithful\", also called the \"Elf-friends\" or ''Elendili''; they were led by the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb. In the reign of Tar-Ancalimon (S.A. 2221-2386) the King's Men became dominant, and the Faithful became a persecuted minority accused of being \"spies of the Valar\". Some Elendili were burnt as sacrifices to Melkor; Nimloth the Fair, the White Tree of the King, was also burnt. \n\n{{anchor|Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n}}\n\n====Sauron====\nIn the year 3255 of the Second Age, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n, the 25th monarch of N\u00famenor, sailed to Middle-earth to challenge [[Sauron]], known to the N\u00famen\u00f3reans as ''Zig\u00fbr'',<ref group=T>''[[Sauron Defeated]]''. pp. 250, 284, 437</ref> had claimed to be the King of Men and overlord of Middle-earth. Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n landed at Umbar, but seeing the might of N\u00famenor, Sauron's armies fled, and Sauron surrendered without a fight. He was brought back to N\u00famenor as a prisoner, but he soon seduced the king and many other N\u00famen\u00f3reans, promising them eternal life if they worshipped his master Melkor. With Sauron as his advisor, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n had a {{convert|500|ft|m|adj=on}} tall temple erected in Armenelos, the capital. In this temple [[human sacrifice]]s were offered to Melkor. During this time, the White Tree Nimloth, which stood before the King's House in Armenelos and whose fate was  tied to the line of kings, was cut down and burned as a sacrifice to Melkor, at Sauron's direction. [[Isildur]] rescued a fruit of the tree which became an ancestor of the [[White Tree of Gondor]].\n\n====Cataclysm====\n[[File:Downfall of N\u00famenor.svg|thumb|upright=2.5|The Downfall of N\u00famenor and the Changing of the World.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shippey |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Shippey |title=The Road to Middle-Earth |date=2005 |edition=Third |origyear=1982 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0261102750 |pages=324-328 |location=The Lost Straight Road}}</ref> The outlines of the continents are purely schematic.]]\n\nPrompted by Sauron and fearing old age and death, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n built a great armada and sailed into the West to make war upon the Valar, intending to seize the Undying Lands and achieve immortality.

The whole population on the island, except Sauron, was drowned. Most of Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n's armada, too, met their doom in the cataclysm. This was the second fall of Men, the first being when Men first awoke and fell swiftly under the dominion of Melkor.\n\n====Aftermath====\n\nSauron was caught in the cataclysm he had helped bring about.

Some survivors, the [[Black N\u00famen\u00f3reans]], continued to serve Sauron, whereas Elendil and the Faithful founded the two Kingdoms in Exile: Arnor in the north, and Gondor in the south.

The best mariners joined the Uinendili, who honoured Uinen, goddess of the Sea.\n\nThe veneration of the sea was combined with the N\u00famen\u00f3reans' astronomical and chronological skills. Among their enhancements of the [[Middle-earth calendar|calendar]], they standardized the day to begin when the sun rose out of the [[Minor places in Middle-earth#Eastern Sea|eastern sea]], and they added a seventh day to the week, which they named ''E\u00e4renya'' (Quenya; Sindarin ''Oraearon''), meaning 'Sea-day'.\n\nThey constructed great cities, towers, walls, harbours and highways, and bred great horses that roamed the open plains of Mittalmar. Emeri\u00eb, a district within Mittalmar, specialized in sheep.\n\n====Rituals====\nBefore the coming of the Shadow, the N\u00famen\u00f3reans maintained several traditions connected with the worship of [[Il\u00favatar]] and respect to the Valar. Among them are recorded the setting a bough of ''oiolair\u00eb'' upon the prow of a departing ship,<ref name=\"AE\" group=T/> the ceremonies concerned with the passing of the Sceptre, and laying down one's life.\n\nThe most famous traditions were the Three Prayers, during which a great concourse of people ascended to the holy summit of Meneltarma and the King praised Eru Il\u00favatar. These were:\n* ''Erukyerm\u00eb'', held at the beginning of spring, the prayer for a good year;\n* ''Erulaital\u00eb'' in the middle of summer, the prayer for a good harvest;\n* ''Eruhantal\u00eb'' in the autumn, the thanksgiving for a good harvest.<ref name=\"DN\" group=T/>\n\nWith the coming of the Shadow, many N\u00famen\u00f3reans turned away from Il\u00favatar and worshipped the evil Vala Morgoth with [[human sacrifice]] in a great temple in Armenelos.\n\n====Calendar====\n\nThe N\u00famen\u00f3rean calendar, the '''King's Reckoning''', is similar to the Gregorian with a week of seven days, a year of 365 days except in [[leap year]]s, and twelve months (''astar''): ten with 30 days and two with 31. However, King's Reckoning has some days outside the months, a feature borrowed from Elvish Calendars, which were generally holidays. Two of these were the pair which book-ends the year; thus the last month of the year was followed by ''mettar\u00eb'', the last day of the year; this was followed by ''yestar\u00eb'', New Year's Day, before the start of the first month. The other monthless day was ''lo\u00ebnd\u00eb'', mid-year day. In a leap year there were two mid-year days. \nIn the Second and Third Ages, years were reckoned from the beginning of the age.\n\nVarious irregularities occur in this calendar, especially following the Downfall. In {{ME-date|TA|2060}}, Mardil Voronw\u00eb revised the calendar, and the new version became the '''Steward's Reckoning''': all the months had 30 days, with two additional \"extra\" days at the [[equinox]]es, ''tuil\u00e9r\u00eb'' and ''y\u00e1vi\u00e9r\u00eb''. The five extra days (the equinoxes, midsummer and two at midwinter) were holidays.\n\nIn T.A. 3019, the Reunited Kingdom adopted a '''New Reckoning''', which began the year on March 25 (cf. [[Lady Day]], the English new year between [[A.D.]] 1155 and 1752), the date of the downfall of Sauron. This made it correspond more closely to the spring beginning of the Elven calendar.\n\nThe months of the Reckonings were in Quenya (or Sindarin among the D\u00fanedain):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Quenya name<ref name=\"RotK_Appendix D\" group=T>{{Harvnb|Return of the King|loc=Appendix D|Ref=Return of the King 1955}}</ref>\n!Sindarin name<ref name=\"RotK_Appendix D\" group=T/>\n!Meaning\n|'''[[French Republican calendar|French]]'''<ref name=\"Allan 1978 151\"/>\n|-\n|Narviny\u00eb || Narwain || new sun<ref name=\"GtS_Appendix 6\" group=T>{{Harvnb|Salo|2004|loc=Appendix 6}}</ref> || ''[[Niv\u00f4se]]''<!--snowy-->\n|-\n|N\u00e9nim\u00eb || N\u00ednui || watery<ref name=\"GtS_Appendix 6\" group=T/> || ''[[Pluvi\u00f4se]]''<!--rainy-->\n|-\n|S\u00falim\u00eb || Gwaeron || windy / wind month<ref name=\"GtS_Appendix 6\" group=T/><ref name=\"Silm_Appendix, sul entry\" group=T>{{Harvnb|Silmarillion|loc=Appendix, s.v.

In addition to presiding over military and civil administration, the monarchs also led N\u00famenor's main religious [[#Rituals|rituals]], such as the Three Prayers.\n\nThe main symbol of N\u00famen\u00f3rean royalty was the [[Sceptre]]. It was not unusual for monarchs to voluntarily \"surrender the Sceptre\" (abdicate), especially in the earlier dynasty.\n\nThe Court of the Kings was located in the capital city, Armenelos. Here also was the royal residence, the King's House. The kings and queens of N\u00famenor were buried about 20 miles out of the city, in the Valley of the Tombs at the foot of the great mountain Meneltarma.\n\nThe [[heir apparent]] was titled the King's Heir. Initially this was the king's [[Primogeniture|eldest son]], but the sixth king, Tar-Aldarion, changed the [[Order of succession|succession law]] so that the eldest child would succeed, irrespective of gender; his daughter thus became the first [[Queen Regnant|Ruling Queen]].\n\nDuring most of N\u00famenor's history, its monarchs bore the title 'Tar-' before their names (for example, Tar-Telperien), literally meaning 'high'.<ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', p. 364</ref> However, the twentieth monarch renounced Quenya in favour of Ad\u00fbnaic, in which the equivalent prefix is 'Ar-'; he thus held the Sceptre as Ar-Ad\u00fbnakh\u00f4r. This policy was followed by most of his successors.\n\n====Council of the Sceptre====\nThe Council of the Sceptre was an institution in N\u00famenor comparable to a [[privy council]]. It could be influential, but it had no vested powers, and could at best only advise the monarch, who had the final say. The Council included the King's Heir, and members from N\u00famenor's regions, including the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb.<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', pp. 216-217, note 23</ref>\n\n====Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb====\nThe rulers of a noble house of N\u00famenor, the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb were named for their ancestral home and fief of [[And\u00fani\u00eb]]. They were members of the Council of the Sceptre, and later became leaders of the Faithful.\n\nThe Lord of And\u00fani\u00eb were descended from Silmari\u00ebn, daughter and oldest child of Tar-Elendil the fourth King of N\u00famenor. The laws of N\u00famenor at that time would not allow females to succeed to the monarchy, and she wedded Elatan of And\u00fani\u00eb and took up residence there. Their son Valandil would be named the first Lord of And\u00fani\u00eb.\n\nThroughout the Second Age, the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb became leaders of the [[Elendili]], or Elf-friends, who remained faithful to the Valar. Their continued importance is reflected by the Lords' ownership of some of N\u00famenor's most precious heirlooms: the sword [[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Narsil|Narsil]], the Ring of Barahir, and the ''palant\u00edri''. This was despite opposition and eventually persecution from the King's Men. The names of most of the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb are not known, though E\u00e4rendur is mentioned at one point.\n\nAt the end of the Second Age, N\u00famenor's estrangement from the Elves and the Valar under the evil guidance of Sauron corrupted N\u00famen\u00f3rean society. Seeking pardon of the Valar for the wickedness of the N\u00famen\u00f3reans, [[Amandil]] the Faithful (son of N\u00famendil), the last Lord of And\u00fani\u00eb, sailed into the west but was never heard of again. His son and heir, Elendil, did not join Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n's grand armada to attack [[Valinor]], and instead fled with his own sons Isildur and An\u00e1rion and many of the Faithful (Elendili) in nine ships to Middle-earth. With them they took the heirlooms of the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb.\n\nIn Middle-earth in the Third Age and the [[Fourth Age]], the Kings of Arnor and the Kings of Gondor, including [[Aragorn]], were directly descended from Isildur and An\u00e1rion, and therefore from the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb. The kings of Arnor inherited the silver rod of the Lord of And\u00fani\u00eb; this rod was renamed the Sceptre of Ann\u00faminas, and was the chief symbol of Arnor's kingship.<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', Appendix A \u00a7I(iii) p. 323 footnote 1</ref> The Princes of Dol Amroth were descended from a family of The Faithful from N\u00famenor who had ruled over the land of [[Belfalas]] since the Second Age. This family of [[N\u00famen\u00f3reans]] were akin to the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb, and thus related to Elendil.<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]],'' Introduction, Part Three, II: \"Cirion and Eorl and the Friendship of Gondor and Rohan\"</ref>\n\n====King's Men====\nThe King's Men or the King's Party were the faction that dominated N\u00famenor in the latter part of its history. Their policy was essentially anti-Valar and anti-Elves, so despite the title ''King's Men'' they did not support any king who revered the god-like Valar or things Elvish. They opposed \"the Faithful\".\n\nIn time the King's Men openly rebelled against the Valar because of their desire for immortality. As the power and knowledge of the N\u00famen\u00f3reans had grown throughout the course of the Second Age, all had become increasingly preoccupied with the limits placed on their contentment\u2014and eventually their power\u2014by mortality, the purpose of which they began to question. This growing wish to escape death, known as 'the doom of Men', also made most of the N\u00famen\u00f3reans envious of the immortal elves, or [[Eldar (Middle-earth)|Eldar]], who they had come to physically resemble as part of their reward from Il\u00favatar for having been their allies. The Eldar sought ever to remind the men of N\u00famenor however, that death was a Gift from Il\u00favatar to all Men, and to lose faith in Il\u00favatar would be heretical. Nevertheless, after Tar-Ancalimon became King of N\u00famenor the power of the King's Men grew.  The King's Men therefore became increasingly predisposed to the corruption of Sauron, who in N\u00famenor's last years seduced the elderly King Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n into evil. Within N\u00famenor, the majority immediately followed suit, and this evil quickly passed across the ocean to N\u00famenor's colonies in Middle-earth.\n\n==N\u00famen\u00f3rean descendants in ''The Lord of the Rings''==\n\nDescendants of the various N\u00famen\u00f3rean factions appear in some chapters of ''The Lord of the Rings''. In Chapter 5 of Book Four, [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] says to [[Faramir]] soon after their first meeting: \"You have an air, sir, that reminds me of, of\u2014well, [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|wizards]], of [[Gandalf]]\". To which Faramir responds: \"Maybe you discern from afar the air of N\u00famenor\". Throughout this chapter, Faramir tells [[Frodo Baggins]] much of the history of N\u00famenor and of its descendants, his ancestors. The [[Stewards of Gondor|Stewards]] of which Faramir was the heir did have some N\u00famen\u00f3rean ancestry, but their lifespans tended to average about 100\u2013120 years, noticeably shorter than pure N\u00famen\u00f3reans such as Aragorn but longer than other Men.\n\nLater in the book, in \"The [[Morannon|Black Gate]] Opens\", there appears a representative of the opposite faction, the Black N\u00famen\u00f3reans.\n\n:The Lieutenant of the Tower of [[Barad-d\u00fbr]] was he; he had entered the service of the Black Tower when it arose again, and because of his cunning he grew ever higher in the Lord's favour; and he learned great sorcery, and knew much of the mind of [[Sauron]]; and he was more cruel than any [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orc]]. ( ~ ''[[The Return of the King]]'')\n\nIn ''[[The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen]]'', a dying Aragorn tells his wife, the immortal Elf [[Arwen]], \"I am the last of the N\u00famen\u00f3reans, and to me has been given not only a span thrice that of Men of Middle-earth, but also the grace to go at my will and give back the gift\". The grieving Arwen, unreconciled to the impending death of her husband - however long his life had been by normal human standards - responds: \"But I say to you, King of the N\u00famen\u00f3reans, not till now have I understood the tale of your people and their fall. As wicked fools I scorned them, but I pity them at last\".<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', Appendix A, I, v, \"Here follows a part of the Tale of Aragorn and Arwen\"</ref>\n\n==Other literature==\n\n[[C. S. Lewis]]'s 1945 novel ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'' makes reference to \"Numinor and the True West\", which Lewis credits as a then-unpublished creation of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. According to the novel, [[Merlin]] of the [[King Arthur|Arthur]]ian Legend was the last in a long line of wizards familiar with the magic of Middle-earth, brought to the shores of prehistoric Britain by refugees from the sunken continent. Merlin's body was preserved for 1,500 years until the N.I.C.E. established an excavation in Bragdon Wood of Edgestow, England searching for the body in the mid-twentieth century. This is one of many examples of cross-overs between the novels of Lewis and Tolkien, both of whom were members of [[The Inklings]], a literary discussion group at [[Oxford University]] and often shared with each other their literary work in progress.\n\n[[Louis Pauwels|Pauwels]] and [[Jacques Bergier|Bergier]] talk about Numinor and its relevance in both [[Celtic myths]] and the history of European and Indo-European culture in their 1972 book: ''De eeuwige mens'' (''The everlasting/eternal human''). They refer to the works of both Lewis and Tolkien, and mention of Atlantis.\n\n==References==\n\n===Primary===\n::''This list identifies each item's location in Tolkien's writings.''\n{{reflist|group=T|28em}}\n\n===Secondary===\n{{reflist|28em}}\n\n===Sources===\n\n* {{cite book |last=Day |first=David |title=Tolkien: An Illustrated Atlas |date=2015 |publisher=Thunder Bay Press |location=San Diego |isbn=978-1-62686-493-1 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book | last=Salo | first=David | authorlink=David Salo | title=A gateway to Sindarin : a grammar of an Elvish language from J.R.R.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s writings. It was a large island in the Sundering Seas to the west of [[Middle-earth]], the main setting of Tolkien's writings, and was the greatest civilization of [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]]. However, after centuries of prosperity many of the inhabitants ceased to worship the One God, [[Eru Il\u00favatar]], and rebelled against the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]], resulting in the destruction of the island and the death of most of its people. Tolkien intended N\u00famenor to allude to the legendary [[Atlantis]].<ref group=T>''Letters'', ##154, 156, 227.</ref>\n\nN\u00famenor first appeared in print in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set thousands of years after N\u00famenor's destruction. Within ''The Lord of the Rings'', N\u00famenor looms as a fabulous [[Lost city (fiction)|lost civilization]].\n\nAn unfinished story, ''[[Aldarion and Erendis]]'', is set in N\u00famenor at its [[zenith]]; another, ''[[Akallab\u00eath]]'', summarizes its downfall. The appendices to ''The Lord of the Rings'' and several accounts published in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' and ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' series also touch upon it.\n\nOriginally intended to be a part of a time-travel story, Tolkien once saw the tale of the fall of N\u00famenor as a conclusion to his ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and the \"last tale\" about the Elder Days.<ref name=\"LR1\" group=T>''Lost Road'', \"The early history of the legend\", pp. 7\u201310.</ref> Later, with the emergence of ''The Lord of the Rings'', it became the link between these two works and a major part of his [[Tolkien's legendarium|legendarium]].\n\n==Literature==\n===History===\n\n====Land of Gift====\n\nThe island of N\u00famenor was raised from the sea as a gift from the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]] to the [[Edain]], the Fathers of Men who had stood with the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] of [[Beleriand]] against [[Morgoth]] in the wars of the [[First Age]].

Under his rule, and those of his descendants, the N\u00famen\u00f3reans rose to become a powerful people, friendly with Elves, both of [[Eress\u00eba]] and of Middle-earth. The Elves of Eress\u00eba brought gifts  including skills and wonderful plants. Among these gifts were seven ''[[palant\u00edri]]'', magical orbs that could foresee the future, for the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb.\n\n====Sea-kings====\nN\u00famenor was surrounded by the sea: the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] of [[Arda (Tolkien)|Arda]], and the sea had a profound influence on N\u00famenor's culture and history. From the earliest times in its history, [[Fish as food|fish]] from the sea were a significant part of N\u00famen\u00f3rean diet; those providing this food were N\u00famenor's first sea-farers.<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 2 ch. 1 \"A Description of the Island of Numenor\"</ref> The N\u00famen\u00f3reans swiftly became skilled [[Shipbuilding|shipbuilders]] and [[Seafaring|mariners]], with a desire to explore and master the ocean. There was one limitation on this activity: the Ban of the Valar. When the island of N\u00famenor had been gifted to the Edain, they were strictly \"forbidden to sail west out of sight\" of the island. This was because the [[Undying Lands]], forbidden to mortals, lay tantalizingly not far west of N\u00famenor.\n\nSo the N\u00famen\u00f3reans began exploring the seas to the north, east and south. In {{ME-date|SA|600}} they reached [[Middle-earth]] to the east, and explored its coasts; eventually they reached the Eastern Sea on the far side of Middle-earth. The N\u00famen\u00f3reans brought the gifts of their superior civilization to the Men of Middle-earth, who called the N\u00famen\u00f3reans the Sea-kings.<ref name=\"R.

He established Vinyalond\u00eb (later called [[Lond Daer]]), the first N\u00famen\u00f3rean settlement in Middle-earth. This port provided access to the great forests of [[Eriador]], which the N\u00famen\u00f3reans needed for ship-building.\n\nBetween {{ME-date|SA|1693}}-1701, the N\u00famen\u00f3reans assisted Gil-galad in Middle-earth's War of the Elves and Sauron, which broke out after the forging of the [[Rings of Power]], in particular the [[One Ring]]. Tar-Minastir, later<ref group=T>Most of Tolkien's writings on the event refer to \"Tar-Minastir\", indicating he was the king at the time. However one of Tolkien's writings, 'The Line of Elros', states that Minastir did not become king until S.A. 1731. The discrepancy is noted in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 2 ch. 3 \"The Line of Elros\", note 9</ref> the eleventh King of N\u00famenor, assembled an armada, and sent it to Gil-galad's aid. The forces of N\u00famenor were without peer in war, and together with the Elves, they were able to temporarily defeat Sauron.\n\n====The Shadow looms====\nThe increasing power of the N\u00famen\u00f3reans had a dark side; the exploitation of Middle-earth's forests had devastated large regions of Eriador. The N\u00famen\u00f3reans established further settlements in Middle-earth, coming to to rule a coastal empire with no rival. At first they had engaged with the Men of Middle-earth in a friendly manner, but Minastir's successors, Tar-Ciryatan (ruled {{Me-date|SA|1869}}-2029) and Tar-Atanamir 'the Great' (2029-2221), became increasingly tyrannical, oppressing the Men of Middle-earth and exacting heavy tribute.\nIn {{ME-date|SA|2280}} the N\u00famen\u00f3reans made [[Umbar]], the harbour-city in [[Harad|the south]] of Middle-earth, into a great fortress. In S.A. 2350 they greatly expanded [[Pelargir]], a landing in [[Gondor]] near the Mouths of the [[Anduin]]. Increasing numbers of N\u00famen\u00f3reans became jealous of Elves for their immortality, resenting the Ban of the Valar, and sought everlasting life. Those of this persuasion were the faction of \"King's Men\", while those who remained loyal to the Valar and friendly to the Elves (and using Elvish languages) were the \"Faithful\", also called the \"Elf-friends\" or ''Elendili''; they were led by the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb. In the reign of Tar-Ancalimon (S.A. 2221-2386) the King's Men became dominant, and the Faithful became a persecuted minority accused of being \"spies of the Valar\". Some Elendili were burnt as sacrifices to Melkor; Nimloth the Fair, the White Tree of the King, was also burnt.\n\n{{anchor|Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n}}\n\n====Sauron====\nIn the year 3255 of the Second Age, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n, the 25th monarch of N\u00famenor, sailed to Middle-earth to challenge [[Sauron]], known to the N\u00famen\u00f3reans as ''Zig\u00fbr'',<ref group=T>''[[Sauron Defeated]]''. pp. 250, 284, 437</ref> had claimed to be the King of Men and overlord of Middle-earth. Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n landed at Umbar, but seeing the might of N\u00famenor, Sauron's armies fled, and Sauron surrendered without a fight. He was brought back to N\u00famenor as a prisoner, but he soon seduced the king and many other N\u00famen\u00f3reans, promising them eternal life if they worshipped his master Melkor. With Sauron as his advisor, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n had a {{convert|500|ft|m|adj=on}} tall temple erected in Armenelos, the capital. In this temple [[human sacrifice]]s were offered to Melkor. During this time, the White Tree Nimloth, which stood before the King's House in Armenelos and whose fate was  tied to the line of kings, was cut down and burned as a sacrifice to Melkor, at Sauron's direction. [[Isildur]] rescued a fruit of the tree which became an ancestor of the [[White Tree of Gondor]].\n\n====Cataclysm====\n[[File:Downfall of N\u00famenor.svg|thumb|upright=2.5|The Downfall of N\u00famenor and the Changing of the World.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shippey |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Shippey |title=The Road to Middle-Earth |date=2005 |edition=Third |origyear=1982 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0261102750 |pages=324-328 |location=The Lost Straight Road}}</ref> The outlines of the continents are purely schematic.]]\n\nPrompted by Sauron and fearing old age and death, Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n built a great armada and sailed into the West to make war upon the Valar, intending to seize the Undying Lands and achieve immortality.

As the Valar were forbidden to take direct action against Men, [[Manw\u00eb]], chief of the Valar, called upon [[Eru Il\u00favatar]], the One God.\n\nIn response, Eru caused the Changing of the World: the hitherto [[flat Earth]] was transformed into a globe, N\u00famenor sank beneath the ocean, <ref>{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Foster |date=1978 |title=[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]] |publisher=[[Allen & Unwin|Unwin Paperbacks]] |chapter=Change of the World |ISBN=0-04-803001-5}}</ref> and the Undying Lands were removed from the Earth forever. The whole population on the island, except Sauron, was drowned. Most of Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n's armada, too, met their doom in the cataclysm. This was the second fall of Men, the first being when Men first awoke and fell swiftly under the dominion of Melkor.\n\n====Aftermath====\n\nSauron was caught in the cataclysm he had helped bring about. His body perished, and he could never again assume a fair form. He fled back to Middle-earth as a monstrous \"spirit of hatred borne upon a dark wind\", returning to [[Mordor]].<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', book 6, ch. 4 \"The Field of Cormallen\"</ref>\n\nSome N\u00famen\u00f3reans had left the island before its destruction. Some survivors, the [[Black N\u00famen\u00f3reans]], continued to serve Sauron, whereas Elendil and the Faithful founded the two Kingdoms in Exile: Arnor in the north, and Gondor in the south. The two kingdoms endeavoured to maintain N\u00famen\u00f3rean culture.

The Mittalmar is described as \"raised above the promontories\"; higher still, at its centre, stood the great mountain of Meneltarma. Much of the region consisted of grasslands, pastures and low downs with few trees.<ref name=\"DN\" group=T/> N\u00famenor's main rivers, Siril and Nunduin\u00eb, arose in Mittalmar, on or near Meneltarma.\n\n:Mittalmar's eastern district, Arandor, was the most populated part of N\u00famenor, and contained the cities of Armenelos (the kingdom's capital) and R\u00f3menna. In the south-west of Mittalmar lay the district of Emeri\u00eb, N\u00famenor's prime sheep-grazing area.</div>\n\n<div id=\"Andustar\">\n;Andustar ''or'' \"the Westlands\": A generally fertile and wood-covered region, which became rocky to the north. The western coastline of the peninsula was formed by high cliffs, which were cut by three bays, including the Bay of And\u00fani\u00eb; several harbours were built in these bays, upon thin shelving land at the feet of steep hills. The northern highlands were covered by fir-woods, while in the south the forests consisted mainly of [[birch]]es and [[beech]]es upon the upper ground and of [[oak]]s and [[elm]]s in vales. The Andustar was separated from the Hyarnustar in the south by the wide Bay of Eldanna and a small borderland called the N\u00edsimaldar.<ref name=\"DN\" group=T/></div>\n\n<div id=\"Hyarnustar\">\n;Hyarnustar ''or'' \"the Southwestlands\": This promontory-region was noted for the great [[vineyard]]s and fertile farmlands in its eastern half, which in the southwest gave way to highlands with great cliffs along the coast. In the far east were \"wide white beaches and grey shingles\", with numerous villages such as Nindamos, and the marshes formed by the river Siril.<ref name=\"DN\" group=T/></div>\n\n<div id=\"Hyarrostar\">\n;Hyarrostar ''or'' \"the Southeastlands\": The most low-lying peninsula of N\u00famenor, with long gentle shores, especially in the west.

The city's foundation dates as {{ME-date|SA|32}} at the latest.<ref name=\"LE\" group=T/> Armenelos contained the royal palace, the King's House. A tall tower was constructed there by Elros (the first [[#Monarchy|King of N\u00famenor]]), and the [[White Tree]] Nimloth was planted in the days of Tar-Aldarion (the sixth king). During the reign of Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n (the 25th monarch) a giant circular temple to [[Morgoth]] was built in Armenelos, over five hundred feet in diameter and as much in height to its cornice line, above which a silver dome rose.

In later centuries their chief industries were shipbuilding and seafaring, exploring the world in all directions save for the west, where the Ban of the Valar was in force. They often travelled to the shores of Middle-earth, teaching the men there the arts and crafts, and they introduced farming. The best mariners joined the Uinendili, who honoured Uinen, goddess of the Sea.\n\nThe veneration of the sea was combined with the N\u00famen\u00f3reans' astronomical and chronological skills. Among their enhancements of the [[Middle-earth calendar|calendar]], they standardized the day to begin when the sun rose out of the [[Minor places in Middle-earth#Eastern Sea|eastern sea]], and they added a seventh day to the week, which they named ''E\u00e4renya'' (Quenya; Sindarin ''Oraearon''), meaning 'Sea-day'.\n\nThey constructed great cities, towers, walls, harbours and highways, and bred great horses that roamed the open plains of Mittalmar. Emeri\u00eb, a district within Mittalmar, specialized in sheep.\n\n====Rituals====\nBefore the coming of the Shadow, the N\u00famen\u00f3reans maintained several traditions connected with the worship of [[Il\u00favatar]] and respect to the Valar. Among them are recorded the setting a bough of ''oiolair\u00eb'' upon the prow of a departing ship,<ref name=\"AE\" group=T/> the ceremonies concerned with the passing of the Sceptre, and laying down one's life.\n\nThe most famous traditions were the Three Prayers, during which a great concourse of people ascended to the holy summit of Meneltarma and the King praised Eru Il\u00favatar. These were:\n* ''Erukyerm\u00eb'', held at the beginning of spring, the prayer for a good year;\n* ''Erulaital\u00eb'' in the middle of summer, the prayer for a good harvest;\n* ''Eruhantal\u00eb'' in the autumn, the thanksgiving for a good harvest.<ref name=\"DN\" group=T/>\n\nWith the coming of the Shadow, many N\u00famen\u00f3reans turned away from Il\u00favatar and worshipped the evil Vala Morgoth with [[human sacrifice]] in a great temple in Armenelos.\n\n====Calendar====\n\nThe N\u00famen\u00f3rean calendar, the '''King's Reckoning''', is similar to the Gregorian with a week of seven days, a year of 365 days except in [[leap year]]s, and twelve months (''astar''): ten with 30 days and two with 31. However, King's Reckoning has some days outside the months, a feature borrowed from Elvish Calendars, which were generally holidays. Two of these were the pair which book-ends the year; thus the last month of the year was followed by ''mettar\u00eb'', the last day of the year; this was followed by ''yestar\u00eb'', New Year's Day, before the start of the first month. The other monthless day was ''lo\u00ebnd\u00eb'', mid-year day. In a leap year there were two mid-year days. \nIn the Second and Third Ages, years were reckoned from the beginning of the age.\n\nVarious irregularities occur in this calendar, especially following the Downfall. In {{ME-date|TA|2060}}, Mardil Voronw\u00eb revised the calendar, and the new version became the '''Steward's Reckoning''': all the months had 30 days, with two additional \"extra\" days at the [[equinox]]es, ''tuil\u00e9r\u00eb'' and ''y\u00e1vi\u00e9r\u00eb''. The five extra days (the equinoxes, midsummer and two at midwinter) were holidays.\n\nIn T.A. 3019, the Reunited Kingdom adopted a '''New Reckoning''', which began the year on March 25 (cf.

In addition to presiding over military and civil administration, the monarchs also led N\u00famenor's main religious [[#Rituals|rituals]], such as the Three Prayers.\n\nThe main symbol of N\u00famen\u00f3rean royalty was the [[Sceptre]]. It was not unusual for monarchs to voluntarily \"surrender the Sceptre\" (abdicate), especially in the earlier dynasty.\n\nThe Court of the Kings was located in the capital city, Armenelos. Here also was the royal residence, the King's House. The kings and queens of N\u00famenor were buried about 20 miles out of the city, in the Valley of the Tombs at the foot of the great mountain Meneltarma.\n\nThe [[heir apparent]] was titled the King's Heir. Initially this was the king's [[Primogeniture|eldest son]], but the sixth king, Tar-Aldarion, changed the [[Order of succession|succession law]] so that the eldest child would succeed, irrespective of gender; his daughter thus became the first [[Queen Regnant|Ruling Queen]].\n\nDuring most of N\u00famenor's history, its monarchs bore the title 'Tar-' before their names (for example, Tar-Telperien), literally meaning 'high'.<ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', p. 364</ref> However, the twentieth monarch renounced Quenya in favour of Ad\u00fbnaic, in which the equivalent prefix is 'Ar-'; he thus held the Sceptre as Ar-Ad\u00fbnakh\u00f4r. This policy was followed by most of his successors.\n\n====Council of the Sceptre====\nThe Council of the Sceptre was an institution in N\u00famenor comparable to a [[privy council]]. It could be influential, but it had no vested powers, and could at best only advise the monarch, who had the final say. The Council included the King's Heir, and members from N\u00famenor's regions, including the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb.<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', pp. 216-217, note 23</ref>\n\n====Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb====\nThe rulers of a noble house of N\u00famenor, the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb were named for their ancestral home and fief of [[And\u00fani\u00eb]]. They were members of the Council of the Sceptre, and later became leaders of the Faithful.\n\nThe Lord of And\u00fani\u00eb were descended from Silmari\u00ebn, daughter and oldest child of Tar-Elendil the fourth King of N\u00famenor. The laws of N\u00famenor at that time would not allow females to succeed to the monarchy, and she wedded Elatan of And\u00fani\u00eb and took up residence there. Their son Valandil would be named the first Lord of And\u00fani\u00eb.\n\nThroughout the Second Age, the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb became leaders of the [[Elendili]], or Elf-friends, who remained faithful to the Valar. Their continued importance is reflected by the Lords' ownership of some of N\u00famenor's most precious heirlooms: the sword [[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Narsil|Narsil]], the Ring of Barahir, and the ''palant\u00edri''. This was despite opposition and eventually persecution from the King's Men. The names of most of the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb are not known, though E\u00e4rendur is mentioned at one point.\n\nAt the end of the Second Age, N\u00famenor's estrangement from the Elves and the Valar under the evil guidance of Sauron corrupted N\u00famen\u00f3rean society. Seeking pardon of the Valar for the wickedness of the N\u00famen\u00f3reans, [[Amandil]] the Faithful (son of N\u00famendil), the last Lord of And\u00fani\u00eb, sailed into the west but was never heard of again. His son and heir, Elendil, did not join Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n's grand armada to attack [[Valinor]], and instead fled with his own sons Isildur and An\u00e1rion and many of the Faithful (Elendili) in nine ships to Middle-earth. With them they took the heirlooms of the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb.\n\nIn Middle-earth in the Third Age and the [[Fourth Age]], the Kings of Arnor and the Kings of Gondor, including [[Aragorn]], were directly descended from Isildur and An\u00e1rion, and therefore from the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb. The kings of Arnor inherited the silver rod of the Lord of And\u00fani\u00eb; this rod was renamed the Sceptre of Ann\u00faminas, and was the chief symbol of Arnor's kingship.<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', Appendix A \u00a7I(iii) p. 323 footnote 1</ref> The Princes of Dol Amroth were descended from a family of The Faithful from N\u00famenor who had ruled over the land of [[Belfalas]] since the Second Age. This family of [[N\u00famen\u00f3reans]] were akin to the Lords of And\u00fani\u00eb, and thus related to Elendil.<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]],'' Introduction, Part Three, II: \"Cirion and Eorl and the Friendship of Gondor and Rohan\"</ref>\n\n====King's Men====\nThe King's Men or the King's Party were the faction that dominated N\u00famenor in the latter part of its history. Their policy was essentially anti-Valar and anti-Elves, so despite the title ''King's Men'' they did not support any king who revered the god-like Valar or things Elvish. They opposed \"the Faithful\".\n\nIn time the King's Men openly rebelled against the Valar because of their desire for immortality. As the power and knowledge of the N\u00famen\u00f3reans had grown throughout the course of the Second Age, all had become increasingly preoccupied with the limits placed on their contentment\u2014and eventually their power\u2014by mortality, the purpose of which they began to question. This growing wish to escape death, known as 'the doom of Men', also made most of the N\u00famen\u00f3reans envious of the immortal elves, or [[Eldar (Middle-earth)|Eldar]], who they had come to physically resemble as part of their reward from Il\u00favatar for having been their allies. The Eldar sought ever to remind the men of N\u00famenor however, that death was a Gift from Il\u00favatar to all Men, and to lose faith in Il\u00favatar would be heretical. Nevertheless, after Tar-Ancalimon became King of N\u00famenor the power of the King's Men grew.  The King's Men therefore became increasingly predisposed to the corruption of Sauron, who in N\u00famenor's last years seduced the elderly King Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n into evil. Within N\u00famenor, the majority immediately followed suit, and this evil quickly passed across the ocean to N\u00famenor's colonies in Middle-earth.\n\n==N\u00famen\u00f3rean descendants in ''The Lord of the Rings''==\n\nDescendants of the various N\u00famen\u00f3rean factions appear in some chapters of ''The Lord of the Rings''. In Chapter 5 of Book Four, [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] says to [[Faramir]] soon after their first meeting: \"You have an air, sir, that reminds me of, of\u2014well, [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|wizards]], of [[Gandalf]]\". To which Faramir responds: \"Maybe you discern from afar the air of N\u00famenor\". Throughout this chapter, Faramir tells [[Frodo Baggins]] much of the history of N\u00famenor and of its descendants, his ancestors. The [[Stewards of Gondor|Stewards]] of which Faramir was the heir did have some N\u00famen\u00f3rean ancestry, but their lifespans tended to average about 100\u2013120 years, noticeably shorter than pure N\u00famen\u00f3reans such as Aragorn but longer than other Men.\n\nLater in the book, in \"The [[Morannon|Black Gate]] Opens\", there appears a representative of the opposite faction, the Black N\u00famen\u00f3reans.\n\n:The Lieutenant of the Tower of [[Barad-d\u00fbr]] was he; he had entered the service of the Black Tower when it arose again, and because of his cunning he grew ever higher in the Lord's favour; and he learned great sorcery, and knew much of the mind of [[Sauron]]; and he was more cruel than any [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orc]]. ( ~ ''[[The Return of the King]]'')\n\nIn ''[[The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen]]'', a dying Aragorn tells his wife, the immortal Elf [[Arwen]], \"I am the last of the N\u00famen\u00f3reans, and to me has been given not only a span thrice that of Men of Middle-earth, but also the grace to go at my will and give back the gift\". The grieving Arwen, unreconciled to the impending death of her husband - however long his life had been by normal human standards - responds: \"But I say to you, King of the N\u00famen\u00f3reans, not till now have I understood the tale of your people and their fall. As wicked fools I scorned them, but I pity them at last\".<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', Appendix A, I, v, \"Here follows a part of the Tale of Aragorn and Arwen\"</ref>\n\n==Other literature==\n\n[[C. S. Lewis]]'s 1945 novel ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'' makes reference to \"Numinor and the True West\", which Lewis credits as a then-unpublished creation of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. According to the novel, [[Merlin]] of the [[King Arthur|Arthur]]ian Legend was the last in a long line of wizards familiar with the magic of Middle-earth, brought to the shores of prehistoric Britain by refugees from the sunken continent. Merlin's body was preserved for 1,500 years until the N.I.C.E. established an excavation in Bragdon Wood of Edgestow, England searching for the body in the mid-twentieth century. This is one of many examples of cross-overs between the novels of Lewis and Tolkien, both of whom were members of [[The Inklings]], a literary discussion group at [[Oxford University]] and often shared with each other their literary work in progress.\n\n[[Louis Pauwels|Pauwels]] and [[Jacques Bergier|Bergier]] talk about Numinor and its relevance in both [[Celtic myths]] and the history of European and Indo-European culture in their 1972 book: ''De eeuwige mens'' (''The everlasting/eternal human''). They refer to the works of both Lewis and Tolkien, and mention of Atlantis.\n\n==References==\n\n===Primary===\n::''This list identifies each item's location in Tolkien's writings.''\n{{reflist|group=T|28em}}\n\n===Secondary===\n{{reflist|28em}}\n\n===Sources===\n\n* {{cite book |last=Day |first=David |title=Tolkien: An Illustrated Atlas |date=2015 |publisher=Thunder Bay Press |location=San Diego |isbn=978-1-62686-493-1 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book | last=Salo | first=David | authorlink=David Salo | title=A gateway to Sindarin : a grammar of an Elvish language from J.R.R.
