[[Bob McNair]] then spearheaded an effort to get the NFL to create an expansion team in Houston to replace the Oilers and even out the league's teams at 32.

The [[AFC South]] was created with the Texans joining as an expansion team, the Titans and [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] joining from the former [[AFC Central]], and the Colts joining from the [[AFC East]]. The Titans and Jaguars were already [[Jaguars\u2013Titans rivalry|rivals]] coming into the division, but the Colts and Texans would have to develop new divisional rivalries, as Indianapolis would leave behind its old rivalries from the AFC East, including a [[Colts\u2013Patriots rivalry|developing rivalry]] with the [[New England Patriots]].\n\n===2002\u20132010===\nEfforts for Houston to develop any heated rivalries in the 2000s were for naught, as the Texans were one of the NFL's bottom tier teams for much of their first nine years of playing. Indianapolis, on the other hand, was one of the NFL's powerhouses, featuring a stellar offense with quarterback [[Peyton Manning]] and receivers [[Marvin Harrison]] and [[Reggie Wayne]]. The Colts won the division 7 out of 9 years during this period and managed to make the playoffs each time.\n\nThe Colts and Texans first met on September 22, 2002 at [[NRG Stadium|Reliant Stadium]] in Houston, with Manning passing for 272 yards and two touchdowns while Texans rookie quarterback [[David Carr (American football)|David Carr]] struggled, only amassing 99 yards, an interception, and a 47.3 passer rating as the Colts routed the Texans 23\u20133.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200209220htx.htm |title=Indianapolis Colts at Houston Texans - September 22nd, 2002 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref> The Colts wound up winning each of the first nine meetings between the teams, including a 49\u201314 victory at the [[RCA Dome]] in 2004,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/recap?gameId=241114011 |title=Texans vs. Colts - Game Recap - November 14, 2004 - ESPN |website=ESPN.com |language=en |access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref> before Houston finally beat Indianapolis in week 16 of the 2006 season.

[[Bob McNair]] then spearheaded an effort to get the NFL to create an expansion team in Houston to replace the Oilers and even out the league's teams at 32. In 1999, the NFL officially awarded the 32nd franchise to McNair. The Texans began playing in 2002.<ref name=\"TexansTeamHistory\">{{cite web|title=Texans Team History|url=https://www.houstontexans.com/team/team-history|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=HoustonTexans.com|access-date=December 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe formation of the Texans necessitated the reorganization of the league's divisions. The [[AFC South]] was created with the Texans joining as an expansion team, the Titans and [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] joining from the former [[AFC Central]], and the Colts joining from the [[AFC East]]. The Titans and Jaguars were already [[Jaguars\u2013Titans rivalry|rivals]] coming into the division, but the Colts and Texans would have to develop new divisional rivalries, as Indianapolis would leave behind its old rivalries from the AFC East, including a [[Colts\u2013Patriots rivalry|developing rivalry]] with the [[New England Patriots]].\n\n===2002\u20132010===\nEfforts for Houston to develop any heated rivalries in the 2000s were for naught, as the Texans were one of the NFL's bottom tier teams for much of their first nine years of playing. Indianapolis, on the other hand, was one of the NFL's powerhouses, featuring a stellar offense with quarterback [[Peyton Manning]] and receivers [[Marvin Harrison]] and [[Reggie Wayne]]. The Colts won the division 7 out of 9 years during this period and managed to make the playoffs each time.\n\nThe Colts and Texans first met on September 22, 2002 at [[NRG Stadium|Reliant Stadium]] in Houston, with Manning passing for 272 yards and two touchdowns while Texans rookie quarterback [[David Carr (American football)|David Carr]] struggled, only amassing 99 yards, an interception, and a 47.3 passer rating as the Colts routed the Texans 23\u20133.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200209220htx.htm |title=Indianapolis Colts at Houston Texans - September 22nd, 2002 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref> The Colts wound up winning each of the first nine meetings between the teams, including a 49\u201314 victory at the [[RCA Dome]] in 2004,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/recap?gameId=241114011 |title=Texans vs. Colts - Game Recap - November 14, 2004 - ESPN |website=ESPN.com |language=en |access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref> before Houston finally beat Indianapolis in week 16 of the 2006 season.

The engineer, William Rockefeller, later admitted that before reaching the curve he had gone into a \"daze\", a sort of [[highway hypnosis]].\n\nThe leader of the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) team investigating said it was likely that the accident would have been prevented had [[positive train control]] (PTC) been installed per a prior federal mandate requiring its installation by 2015. Due to a number of other recent accidents involving Metro-North trains and tracks, the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA) demanded improved safety measures, which Metro-North began implementing within a week of the accident.\n\nIn late 2014, almost a year after the accident, the NTSB released its final report on the accident. After reiterating its earlier conclusion that PTC would have prevented the accident entirely, it found the most direct cause was Rockefeller's inattention as the train entered the curve. There were other contributing factors. A medical examination following the accident diagnosed [[sleep apnea]], which had hampered his ability to fully adjust his sleep patterns to the morning shift which he had begun working two weeks earlier. The report faulted both Metro-North for not screening its employees in sensitive positions for [[sleep disorder]]s, and the FRA for not requiring railroads to do such screening.<ref name=\"NTSB brief\" />\n\n=={{anchor|Train}}Background==\n\nThe train involved in the accident was the second southbound [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]] train of the day, leaving [[Poughkeepsie (Metro-North station)|Poughkeepsie]], the line's northern terminus, at its scheduled departure time of 5:54&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]].<ref name=\"current Metro-North schedule\">[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], {{cite web|url= http://web.mta.info/mnr/html/planning/schedules/pdf/NOV172013HUD-SS.pdf |title=Hudson Line weekend schedule|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|date= November 17, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216041718/http://www.mta.info/mnr/html/planning/schedules/pdf/NOV172013HUD-SS.pdf|archivedate=December 16, 2013|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref> It was powered by a [[GE Genesis|GE P32AC-DM]] [[dual-mode locomotive|locomotive]],<ref name=\"Rockefeller interview transcript\">{{cite web|title=Transcript of Interview 8808 Engineer|url=http://dms.ntsb.gov/public%2F55500-55999%2F55841%2F551511.pdf|publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]]|page=48|date=December 3, 2013|accessdate=October 31, 2014}}</ref> capable of running on either diesel fuel or electricity from a [[third rail]].

The MTA said it was considering doing so at 30 sites on the Metro-North and LIRR networks.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" /> On December 6, the FRA issued an emergency order requiring Metro-North to have two qualified crew members in the cab at any point where the speed limit drops by more than {{convert|20|mph}} until it installs that technology in cabs and at those sites.<ref name=\"FRA mandate story\" /> The next day Metro-North announced it was upgrading the signals at the Spuyten Duyvil curve and several others in the system; it would also lower the speed limit going into the curve so that it would be a less-than-20-mph drop and thus the extra engineer would not be necessary.<ref name=\"MTA changes story\">{{cite news|title=Safety Upgrades Coming to Metro-North Derailment Site: MTA|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Safety-Upgrades-MTA-Metro-North-Train-Derailment-Bronx-Spuyten-Duyvil-Curve-234987791.html|newspaper=[[WNBC-TV]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref> U.S. Senators [[Richard Blumenthal]] of Connecticut and [[Charles Schumer]] of New York called on Metro-North to install cameras to monitor both the track and the engineers.<ref name=\"Senators call for cameras\">{{cite news|last=Castillo|first=Alfonso A.|title=Senators call for train cameras to monitor engineer, track|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/senators-call-for-train-cameras-to-monitor-engineer-track-1.6564959|newspaper=[[Newsday]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn December 12, the FRA went further.

The engineer, William Rockefeller, later admitted that before reaching the curve he had gone into a \"daze\", a sort of [[highway hypnosis]].\n\nThe leader of the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) team investigating said it was likely that the accident would have been prevented had [[positive train control]] (PTC) been installed per a prior federal mandate requiring its installation by 2015. Due to a number of other recent accidents involving Metro-North trains and tracks, the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA) demanded improved safety measures, which Metro-North began implementing within a week of the accident.\n\nIn late 2014, almost a year after the accident, the NTSB released its final report on the accident. After reiterating its earlier conclusion that PTC would have prevented the accident entirely, it found the most direct cause was Rockefeller's inattention as the train entered the curve. There were other contributing factors. A medical examination following the accident diagnosed [[sleep apnea]], which had hampered his ability to fully adjust his sleep patterns to the morning shift which he had begun working two weeks earlier. The report faulted both Metro-North for not screening its employees in sensitive positions for [[sleep disorder]]s, and the FRA for not requiring railroads to do such screening.<ref name=\"NTSB brief\" />\n\n=={{anchor|Train}}Background==\n\nThe train involved in the accident was the second southbound [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]] train of the day, leaving [[Poughkeepsie (Metro-North station)|Poughkeepsie]], the line's northern terminus, at its scheduled departure time of 5:54&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]].<ref name=\"current Metro-North schedule\">[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], {{cite web|url= http://web.mta.info/mnr/html/planning/schedules/pdf/NOV172013HUD-SS.pdf |title=Hudson Line weekend schedule|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|date= November 17, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216041718/http://www.mta.info/mnr/html/planning/schedules/pdf/NOV172013HUD-SS.pdf|archivedate=December 16, 2013|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref> It was powered by a [[GE Genesis|GE P32AC-DM]] [[dual-mode locomotive|locomotive]],<ref name=\"Rockefeller interview transcript\">{{cite web|title=Transcript of Interview 8808 Engineer|url=http://dms.ntsb.gov/public%2F55500-55999%2F55841%2F551511.pdf|publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]]|page=48|date=December 3, 2013|accessdate=October 31, 2014}}</ref> capable of running on either diesel fuel or electricity from a [[third rail]].

These had led to five deaths and 129 injuries. \"The specific causes of each of these accidents may vary,\" Szabo wrote, \"but regardless of the reasons, four serious accidents in less than seven months is simply unacceptable.\"<ref name=\"FRA letter story\">{{cite news|last1=Keane|first1=Angela Greiling|last2=Klopott|first2=Freeman|last3=Goldman|first3=Henry|title=Metro-North Rebuked by U.S. Rail Regulator Over Accidents|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-04/metro-north-rebuked-by-u-s-rail-regulator-over-accidents.html|newspaper=[[Bloomberg news]]|date=December 3, 2013|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nSzabo asked the MTA for \"a serious, good faith commitment to the safe operation of the system.\" He said it needed to tell employees what, specifically, it would do to improve safety. He requested an answer in two days.<ref name=\"FRA letter story\" /> \"Immediate corrective action is imperative.\" Metro-North announced the day afterwards that it would institute a telephone line where employees could confidentially report \"close calls.\"<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" /> Prendergast later replied to Szabo that the railroad had held mandatory safety discussions for 4,000 employees at 20 locations since the accident.<ref name=\"FRA mandate story\">{{cite news|last=Juva-Brown|first=Theresa|title=Metro-North ordered to have extra crew members in train cabs, new signals|url=http://www.lohud.com/article/20131206/NEWS/312060056/Metro-North-ordered-extra-crew-members-train-cabs-new-signals|newspaper=The Journal News|date=December 6, 2013|accessdate=December 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe accident spurred further discussion of [[positive train control]] (PTC), which might have prevented it. After a [[2008 Chatsworth train collision|2008 wreck]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], the FRA mandated all American railroads implement PTC by 2015. Many resisted, complaining about the cost of the technology. Among those railroads were both MTA commuter railroads, Metro-North and the [[Long Island Rail Road]], which have sought to have that deadline extended until 2018. In the wake of the Spuyten Duyvil derailment, U.S. Rep. [[Sean Patrick Maloney]], a resident of [[Cold Spring, New York|Cold Spring]] whose neighbor James Lovell was one of those killed, introduced legislation to make low-interest loans and guarantees available so that commuter railroads like Metro-North could implement PTC.<ref name=\"FRA letter story\" /> Eventually other congressmembers from the lower Hudson Valley joined as cosponsors.<ref name=\"Journal News Deep Dive story\">{{cite news|last=Juva-Brown|first=Theresa|title=Bronx derailment: Grants program pushed for Metro-North|url=http://www.lohud.com/article/20131215/NEWS/312150049/Bronx-derailment-Grants-program-pushed-Metro-North-|newspaper=[[The Journal News]]|date=December 15, 2013|accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Metro-North crew installing speed restriction sign.jpg|thumb|left|Metro-North crews install speed-restriction sign on a stretch of the [[New Haven Line]] two weeks after the Spuyten Duyvil accident|alt=Four men in reflectorized orange vests and neon green helmets standing next to a set of four railroad tracks installing a signpost next to the track.

Instead they pointed to doubts about the technology's efficacy for large commuter rail networks. On a radio talk show following the crash, New York Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] conceded that PTC is \"controversial ... [some people say] it's not what it's cracked up to be.\" The MTA itself said it was \"untested and unproven for commuter railroads [of our] size and complexity.\"<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" />\n\nSeveral days later ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the train had a device known as an [[cab signalling#Cab signalling in the United States|alerter]]. It sounds an alarm when the train exceeds speed limits for 25 seconds and shuts it down after an additional 15 seconds if no action is taken by the engineer. It might have been able to prevent the accident; however it was in the locomotive, at the rear of the train, not the cab where Rockefeller was located.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" />\n\nWhile Metro-North used it only to prevent collisions, rail safety experts said it could easily be configured to force trains to slow down at curves such as Spuyten Duyvil, since it relied on signals sent through the rails themselves. It was also preferable to the traditional [[dead man's switch]] the cab was equipped with, which requires constant action and attention from the engineer. The MTA said it was considering doing so at 30 sites on the Metro-North and LIRR networks.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" /> On December 6, the FRA issued an emergency order requiring Metro-North to have two qualified crew members in the cab at any point where the speed limit drops by more than {{convert|20|mph}} until it installs that technology in cabs and at those sites.<ref name=\"FRA mandate story\" /> The next day Metro-North announced it was upgrading the signals at the Spuyten Duyvil curve and several others in the system; it would also lower the speed limit going into the curve so that it would be a less-than-20-mph drop and thus the extra engineer would not be necessary.<ref name=\"MTA changes story\">{{cite news|title=Safety Upgrades Coming to Metro-North Derailment Site: MTA|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Safety-Upgrades-MTA-Metro-North-Train-Derailment-Bronx-Spuyten-Duyvil-Curve-234987791.html|newspaper=[[WNBC-TV]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref> U.S. Senators [[Richard Blumenthal]] of Connecticut and [[Charles Schumer]] of New York called on Metro-North to install cameras to monitor both the track and the engineers.<ref name=\"Senators call for cameras\">{{cite news|last=Castillo|first=Alfonso A.|title=Senators call for train cameras to monitor engineer, track|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/senators-call-for-train-cameras-to-monitor-engineer-track-1.6564959|newspaper=[[Newsday]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn December 12, the FRA went further. It ordered \"Operation Deep Dive,\"<ref name=\"Journal News Deep Dive story\" /> a full safety review of Metro-North, in which every aspect of its corporate culture would be evaluated by a panel of rail safety experts.

The team was named for Baltimore's history of horse breeding and racing. It was the second incarnation of the Baltimore Colts, [[Baltimore Colts (1947\u201350)|the first]] having played for three years in the [[All-America Football Conference]] and one in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The 1953\u201383 Baltimore Colts team played its home games at [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]].\n\n==Franchise history==\nThe Baltimore Colts were one of the first NFL teams to have [[cheerleaders]], a [[marching band]] and a team \"fight song\" (along with the nearby [[Washington Redskins]], forty miles southwest in the nation's capital).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressboxonline.com/story.cfm?id=727|title=Baltimore's Colts: A Team for the Ages|accessdate=2007-08-19|last=Gibbons|first=Michael|date=2006-08-07|publisher=Press Box Online}}</ref> The Baltimore Colts were named after Baltimore's 142-year-old annual \"[[Preakness Stakes]]\", a premier [[thoroughbred horse racing]] event, second jewel of the famous \"[[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)|Triple Crown]]\" championship series of the sport run at the historic [[Pimlico Race Course]] since 1873. This third, most famous Baltimore Colts pro football franchise was officially created in 1953, but can trace its history much earlier than that, to before the NFL itself actually began in 1920: its earliest predecessor was the old [[Dayton Triangles]], a founding member of the reorganized and renamed [[National Football League]] of 1922, (from the old previous [[American Professional Football Association|American Professional Football Conference]], later renamed [[American Professional Football Association|A.P.F. Association]] a few months later in 1920) that was originally created in 1913. Because of the link to the ancient [[Dayton Triangles]], the Baltimore Colts can arguably claim to have played and won, on October 3, 1920, what could be considered the very first A.P.F.A./N.F.L. professional football game, with a 14\u20130 defeat of the rival [[Columbus Panhandles]] at [[Triangle Park (Dayton)|Triangle Park]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. The team went through the following changes:\n\n* [[Dayton Triangles]] pro football team relocated to New York City to the [[Brooklyn|Borough of Brooklyn, New York]] and was renamed [[Brooklyn Dodgers (NFL)|Brooklyn Dodgers]] (separate from the more famous [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] of [[major league baseball]]'s [[National League]]) in 1930.\n* Changed name to Brooklyn Tigers in 1944. In the same year, the [[Boston Yanks]] are founded.\n* Merged with Boston Yanks in 1945 as the World War II-era war-time \"The Yanks\".\n* Brooklyn franchise canceled in 1945 by the League and the team's players were given to the Boston Yanks, as a parallel team, the ([[New York Yankees (AAFC)|New York Yankees]] of the new competing post-war [[All-America Football Conference]] - A.A.F.C.) is founded by the Tigers' former owner, [[Dan Topping]].\n* [[Miami Seahawks]] of the [[All-America Football Conference|A.A.F.C.]] are folded and replaced in the Conference's second season by a new franchise in Baltimore given the name of the \"Colts\" after a name selection contest among the new Baltimore fans. The Colts later joined the reorganized NFL. in 1950, following the merger of the A.A.F.C. with the older league, along with the addition of teams [[San Francisco 49ers]] and the [[Cleveland Browns]]. This second Baltimore Colts franchise was later dissolved by the NFL for financial reasons after only the one 1950 season on January 18, 1951.\n* Boston Yanks were canceled upon request of the team owner for tax purposes. The owner was given a new franchise for New York City in 1949, now named the [[New York Bulldogs]]. The name was then changed to the New York Yanks the following season in 1950. The Yanks absorbed much of the previous football Yankees' roster the next year.\n* New York Yanks of the NFL were canceled after the one 1951 season and replaced in 1952 by the [[Dallas Texans (NFL)|Dallas Texans]], with the first expansion of the League into high school and collegiate football-crazy [[Texas]] and first into the [[Southern United States|southern part of the United States]].\n* Texans owner returned the team leadership to the League ownership of the NFL during mid-season. The Texans become a \"road\" team halfway through the 1952 season with no \"home base\", playing only \"away\" games and folded after the one 1952 season.\nThe Dallas Texans franchise was returned to the league Nov 14, 1952 and after they couldn't find a buyer for the team, the franchise was cancelled. The NFL had a hole in their calendar where the Texans were originally and awarded a new franchise to the Colts in January 1953. NFL says that they consider the Colts as a 1953 expansion team; it does not consider the Colts to be a continuation of the Yanks/Bulldogs/Yanks/Texans franchise.\n\n===AAFC Baltimore Colts===\nAs the result of a fan contest in Baltimore, won by Charles Evans of [[Middle River, Maryland|Middle River]] in suburban eastern [[Baltimore County, Maryland|Baltimore County]], the team was renamed the \"[[Baltimore Colts (1947\u201350)|Baltimore Colts]]\". On September 7, 1947, wearing the green and silver uniforms, the Colts, under Head Coach [[Cecil Isbell]], won their initial [[All-America Football Conference]] game in the A.A.F.C.'s second season, 16\u20137, over the [[Brooklyn Dodgers (AAFC)|Brooklyn Dodgers]]. Home site for the new AAFC games in \"The Monumental City\" was the old 1922 [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Municipal Stadium]] (also known as \"Baltimore Stadium\" or \"Venable Stadium\" - located in previous Venable Park) on the north side of 33rd Street boulevard in northeast Baltimore, later renovated and rebuilt with an upper tier added the following year for use also by the new [[American League]] of major league baseball's relocated franchise, the [[Baltimore Orioles]]). The football team concluded its inaugural season before a record Baltimore crowd of 51,583 by losing to the [[New York Yankees (AAFC)|New York Yankees]], 21\u20137. The Colts finished with a 2\u201311\u20131 record, good for a fourth-place finish in the Eastern Division of the A.A.F.C. The Colts completed the 1948 season with a 7\u20138 record, tying the [[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|Buffalo Bills]] for the division title. The Colts compiled a 1\u201311 mark in their third season of 1949. [[Y. A. Tittle]], later to gain additional hall of fame status a decade later with the NFL's [[New York Giants]] was the Colts starting quarterback.\n\nAfter four years of inter-league rivalry, competition, and player contract raiding, the A.A.F.C. and N.F.L. merged in 1950, and the Colts joined the reorganized new NFL, along with the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and the [[Cleveland Browns]]. After posting a 1\u201311 record for the second consecutive year, the NFL franchise of just one season was dissolved by the League on January 18, 1951. But many Baltimore fans protested the loss of their team and continued to support the [[Baltimore's Marching Ravens|marching band]] (the second in professional football, after that of the [[Washington Redskins]]) and [[fan club]], both of which remained in operation (\"in exile\" status) and worked for the team's revival.\n\n===NFL Dallas Texans===\nAfter two seasons without professional football, [[History of the NFL Commissioner|NFL Commissioner]] [[Bert Bell]] challenged the [[Baltimore|City of Baltimore]] under Mayor [[Thomas D'Alesandro Jr.|Thomas L. J. D'Alesandro Jr.]], in December 1952 to sell 15,000 season tickets within six weeks in order to re-enter the NFL. That 15,000-ticket quota was reached in just four weeks and three days. On January 23, 1953, with the encouragement of the city's civic and business leadership, under the principal ownership of [[Carroll Rosenbloom]], the NFL sold [[Dallas Texans (NFL)|Dallas Texans]] franchise to Baltimore where, keeping the \"Colts\" nickname, the Texans team colors of blue and white were inherited. This is the franchise that exists today in Indianapolis in the modern National Football League.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://colts.com/sub.cfm?page=football_dynamic&id=174|title=A look at the history of the Indianapolis Colts|access-date=2012-07-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225204727/http://www.colts.com/sub.cfm?page=football_dynamic&id=174|archive-date=2010-12-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===In Baltimore===\n\n====1953\u20131967: The Johnny Unitas era====\n[[File:JohnnyUnitasSignAutograph1964.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Johnny Unitas]] was the Baltimore Colts' starting quarterback and famed \"Number 19\", from 1956 to 1972. Unitas was raised in the [[Pittsburgh]] area and played earlier for the [[University of Louisville]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]]]\n\nIn 1953, the second incarnation of the Baltimore Colts took the field for the first time ever at [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]], (then also used temporarily by the old [[Baltimore Orioles]] minor league team in the [[International League]] since the burning in July 1944 of their [[Oriole Park]] home farther southeast at [[Maryland Route 45|Greenmount Avenue]] and 29th Street in [[Waverly, Baltimore|Waverly]]). The newly renamed Memorial field was being rebuilt and adding a second upper tier to old Municipal Stadium for use by the following year of the major league baseball's [[Baltimore Orioles]] franchise in the [[American League]], relocated that November from [[St. Louis, Missouri]] as the [[St. Louis Browns]]. The 33rd Street field also then sometimes known as \"Baltimore Stadium\" or \"Venable Stadium\" for its location in the former Venable Park along the north side of the 33rd Street boulevard, constructed originally as a football-only bowl in 1922 in only seven months and later capable of holding almost 100,000 fans for the frequent high school and local collegiate/university games there during the following three decades), on September 27 to face off against the Chicago Bears. The Colts would go on to win the game 13\u20139 and stun the Bears. The team's lack of experience showed as the team finished 3\u20139. In 1955, the Colts had 12 rookies make the team. In 1956, quarterback George Shaw went down with a serious injury in the fourth game of the season. The Colts' unproven backup, Johnny Unitas, would go on to win half the remaining eight games to give the Colts a record of 5\u20137 for the season.\n\nThe Colts won their first NFL Championship in 1958. The 1958 NFL Championship game is widely known as the \"Greatest Game Ever Played\" for its dramatic conclusion with [[quarterback]] [[Johnny Unitas]] marching the Colts downfield in sudden death overtime and [[Alan Ameche]] scoring the winning touchdown on a 1-yard run. Much of the credit for Baltimore's success went to Hall of Famers Johnny Unitas, [[halfback (American football)|halfback]] [[Lenny Moore]], and [[wide receiver]] [[Raymond Berry]].\n\nFollowing the Colts' first NFL championship, the team once again posted a 9\u20133 record during the [[1959 Baltimore Colts season|1959 season]] and once again defeated the Giants in the [[1959 NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship Game]] to claim their second title in back to back fashion.<ref name=\"Baltimore Colts History\">{{cite web|title=Baltimore Colts: Historical Moments|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/balticolts/baltcolts.html|work=Sports Encyclopedia|accessdate=July 5, 2012}}</ref> Following the two championships in 1958 and 1959, the Colts did not return to the NFL Championship for four seasons and saw a transition from head coach Ewbank to a young [[Don Shula]] in [[1963 Baltimore Colts season|1963]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cole|first=Jason|title=Ewbank overlooked figure of AFL glory|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=jc-weebewbank120309|work=Yahoo!

In 1965 the Colts played the Green Bay Packers in a playoff to determine who would go to the NFL Championship game. The Colts were leading 10\u20137 over the [[Green Bay Packers]] with two minutes left to play when the Packers' kicker, [[Don Chandler]] seemed to barely miss a field goal. <ref>John F. Steadman, ''From Colts to Ravens''. 1997 Tidewater Publishers, pp 164-167</ref>The referee called it good however, and the Packers went on to win the game in overtime. The error precipitated changes to the rules: the NFL decided two referees would judge future field goals, and that the uprights should be raised by ten feet. In [[1968 Baltimore Colts season|1968]] the Colts returned with the continued leadership of Unitas and Shula and went on to win the Colts' third NFL Championship and made an appearance in [[Super Bowl III]]. In 1968, Unitas was injured and replaced by [[Earl Morrall]] who became the league's MVP.\n\n====1968\u20131972: Merger and Super Bowl V====\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 32 - Earl Morrall.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Colts against Dallas in their first Super Bowl championship (V)]]\nLeading up to the Super Bowl and following the 34\u20130 trouncing of the Cleveland Browns in the [[1968 NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship]], many were calling the 1968 Colts team one of the \"greatest pro football teams of all time\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/1102/nfl-top-15-teams-to-not-win-super-bowl/content.4.html|title=Top 15 Team Not to Win the Super Bowl:1968 Baltimore Colts (13\u20131)|accessdate=July 4, 2012|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]}}</ref> and were favored by 18 points against their counterparts from the [[American Football League]], the [[New York Jets]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/dan_shaughnessy/01/18/colts.jets/index.html|title=There's plenty of history between AFC finalists Jets and Colts|accessdate=July 5, 2012|last=Shaughnessy|first=Dan|date=January 19, 2010|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]}}</ref> The Colts, however, were stunned by the Jets, who won the game 16\u20137 in the first Super Bowl victory for the young AFL.

The Colts 1977 playoff loss in double overtime against the Oakland Raiders was famous for the fact that it was the last playoff game for the Colts in Baltimore and is also known for the [[Ghost to the Post]] play. These consecutive playoff teams featured 1976 NFL Most Valuable Player [[Bert Jones]] at quarterback and an outstanding defensive line, nicknamed the \"Sack Pack.\"\n\n====1976\u20131983: Last days of the Baltimore Colts====\nFollowing this relative success in the 1970s, the Colts suffered a string of disappointing seasons, often finishing in last place in their division. Attendance began to dwindle in the early 1970s and remained that way for the rest of the team's tenure in Baltimore. The Colts would endure nine consecutive losing seasons beginning in [[1978 NFL season|1978]]. In [[1981 Baltimore Colts season|1981]], the Colts defense allowed an NFL-record 533 points, set an all-time record for fewest sacks (13), and also set a modern record for fewest punt returns (12).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/clt/1981.htm|title=1981 Baltimore Colts Statistics|accessdate=July 4, 2012|work=Pro Football Reference}}</ref> The following year, the offense collapsed, including a game against the [[Buffalo Bills]] where the Colts' offense did not cross mid-field the entire game. The Colts finished 0\u20138\u20131 in the strike-shortened 1982 season, thereby earning the right to select [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] quarterback [[John Elway]] with the first overall pick. Elway, however, refused to play for Baltimore, and using leverage as a draftee of the [[New York Yankees]] baseball club, forced a trade to [[Denver Broncos|Denver]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stanforddaily.com/2012/05/03/football-a-look-back-at-stanfords-other-no-1-picks/|title=Football: A look back at Stanford's other No. 1 picks|accessdate=July 5, 2012|last=Blanchat|first=Jack|work=The Stanford Daily}}</ref> Behind an improved defense the team finished 7\u20139 in [[1983 Baltimore Colts season|1983]], but that would be their last season in Baltimore.\n\n===Move to Indianapolis===\n{{main article|Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis}}\nThe city of [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], made an offer for the Colts franchise to move there. Baltimore was unsuccessful at persuading them to stay, so the city government attempted to get the state legislature to condemn the Colts franchise and give ownership to another group that would promise to keep the Colts in Baltimore. [[Oakland, California]] had just had some success in court trying the same tactic with the [[Oakland Raiders]]. Under the threat of eminent domain from the city of Baltimore, [[Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis|the franchise relocated to Indianapolis]] in the middle of the night on March 29, 1984. \n\nThe city of Baltimore did not give up and sued to condemn the franchise anyway and seize ownership. Baltimore did not prevail in court,<ref>''Mayor & City Council of Baltimore v. Indianapolis Colts'', 624 F.Supp. 278 (D.Md. 1985)</ref> but eventually acquired a new NFL team in 1996 with the establishment of the [[Baltimore Ravens]] following the [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy]].\n\nMany former Colts players were infuriated by the move. Among the most notable was Johnny Unitas, who opted to cut all ties with his former team after the incident.<ref>{{cite web|last1=SIMERS|first1=T.

The Baltimore Colts Marching Band, which continued to operate after the Colts moved, became [[Baltimore's Marching Ravens]].\n\nOn the other hand, there have been many former Baltimore Colts players who have embraced the franchise as continuous, from Baltimore to Indianapolis. In 2009, Jim Irsay held a reunion of his favorite Colts team ever, the 1975 AFC East champions. 39 of the 50 players on that roster attended the reunion at [[Lucas Oil Stadium]], including quarterback [[Bert Jones]] and running back [[Lydell Mitchell]].

It was the second incarnation of the Baltimore Colts, [[Baltimore Colts (1947\u201350)|the first]] having played for three years in the [[All-America Football Conference]] and one in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The 1953\u201383 Baltimore Colts team played its home games at [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]].\n\n==Franchise history==\nThe Baltimore Colts were one of the first NFL teams to have [[cheerleaders]], a [[marching band]] and a team \"fight song\" (along with the nearby [[Washington Redskins]], forty miles southwest in the nation's capital).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressboxonline.com/story.cfm?id=727|title=Baltimore's Colts: A Team for the Ages|accessdate=2007-08-19|last=Gibbons|first=Michael|date=2006-08-07|publisher=Press Box Online}}</ref> The Baltimore Colts were named after Baltimore's 142-year-old annual \"[[Preakness Stakes]]\", a premier [[thoroughbred horse racing]] event, second jewel of the famous \"[[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)|Triple Crown]]\" championship series of the sport run at the historic [[Pimlico Race Course]] since 1873. This third, most famous Baltimore Colts pro football franchise was officially created in 1953, but can trace its history much earlier than that, to before the NFL itself actually began in 1920: its earliest predecessor was the old [[Dayton Triangles]], a founding member of the reorganized and renamed [[National Football League]] of 1922, (from the old previous [[American Professional Football Association|American Professional Football Conference]], later renamed [[American Professional Football Association|A.P.F. Association]] a few months later in 1920) that was originally created in 1913. Because of the link to the ancient [[Dayton Triangles]], the Baltimore Colts can arguably claim to have played and won, on October 3, 1920, what could be considered the very first A.P.F.A./N.F.L. professional football game, with a 14\u20130 defeat of the rival [[Columbus Panhandles]] at [[Triangle Park (Dayton)|Triangle Park]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. The team went through the following changes:\n\n* [[Dayton Triangles]] pro football team relocated to New York City to the [[Brooklyn|Borough of Brooklyn, New York]] and was renamed [[Brooklyn Dodgers (NFL)|Brooklyn Dodgers]] (separate from the more famous [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] of [[major league baseball]]'s [[National League]]) in 1930.\n* Changed name to Brooklyn Tigers in 1944. In the same year, the [[Boston Yanks]] are founded.\n* Merged with Boston Yanks in 1945 as the World War II-era war-time \"The Yanks\".\n* Brooklyn franchise canceled in 1945 by the League and the team's players were given to the Boston Yanks, as a parallel team, the ([[New York Yankees (AAFC)|New York Yankees]] of the new competing post-war [[All-America Football Conference]] - A.A.F.C.) is founded by the Tigers' former owner, [[Dan Topping]].\n* [[Miami Seahawks]] of the [[All-America Football Conference|A.A.F.C.]] are folded and replaced in the Conference's second season by a new franchise in Baltimore given the name of the \"Colts\" after a name selection contest among the new Baltimore fans. The Colts later joined the reorganized NFL. in 1950, following the merger of the A.A.F.C. with the older league, along with the addition of teams [[San Francisco 49ers]] and the [[Cleveland Browns]]. This second Baltimore Colts franchise was later dissolved by the NFL for financial reasons after only the one 1950 season on January 18, 1951.\n* Boston Yanks were canceled upon request of the team owner for tax purposes. The owner was given a new franchise for New York City in 1949, now named the [[New York Bulldogs]]. The name was then changed to the New York Yanks the following season in 1950. The Yanks absorbed much of the previous football Yankees' roster the next year.\n* New York Yanks of the NFL were canceled after the one 1951 season and replaced in 1952 by the [[Dallas Texans (NFL)|Dallas Texans]], with the first expansion of the League into high school and collegiate football-crazy [[Texas]] and first into the [[Southern United States|southern part of the United States]].\n* Texans owner returned the team leadership to the League ownership of the NFL during mid-season. The Texans become a \"road\" team halfway through the 1952 season with no \"home base\", playing only \"away\" games and folded after the one 1952 season.\nThe Dallas Texans franchise was returned to the league Nov 14, 1952 and after they couldn't find a buyer for the team, the franchise was cancelled. The NFL had a hole in their calendar where the Texans were originally and awarded a new franchise to the Colts in January 1953. NFL says that they consider the Colts as a 1953 expansion team; it does not consider the Colts to be a continuation of the Yanks/Bulldogs/Yanks/Texans franchise.\n\n===AAFC Baltimore Colts===\nAs the result of a fan contest in Baltimore, won by Charles Evans of [[Middle River, Maryland|Middle River]] in suburban eastern [[Baltimore County, Maryland|Baltimore County]], the team was renamed the \"[[Baltimore Colts (1947\u201350)|Baltimore Colts]]\". On September 7, 1947, wearing the green and silver uniforms, the Colts, under Head Coach [[Cecil Isbell]], won their initial [[All-America Football Conference]] game in the A.A.F.C.'s second season, 16\u20137, over the [[Brooklyn Dodgers (AAFC)|Brooklyn Dodgers]]. Home site for the new AAFC games in \"The Monumental City\" was the old 1922 [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Municipal Stadium]] (also known as \"Baltimore Stadium\" or \"Venable Stadium\" - located in previous Venable Park) on the north side of 33rd Street boulevard in northeast Baltimore, later renovated and rebuilt with an upper tier added the following year for use also by the new [[American League]] of major league baseball's relocated franchise, the [[Baltimore Orioles]]). The football team concluded its inaugural season before a record Baltimore crowd of 51,583 by losing to the [[New York Yankees (AAFC)|New York Yankees]], 21\u20137. The Colts finished with a 2\u201311\u20131 record, good for a fourth-place finish in the Eastern Division of the A.A.F.C. The Colts completed the 1948 season with a 7\u20138 record, tying the [[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|Buffalo Bills]] for the division title. The Colts compiled a 1\u201311 mark in their third season of 1949. [[Y. A. Tittle]], later to gain additional hall of fame status a decade later with the NFL's [[New York Giants]] was the Colts starting quarterback.\n\nAfter four years of inter-league rivalry, competition, and player contract raiding, the A.A.F.C. and N.F.L. merged in 1950, and the Colts joined the reorganized new NFL, along with the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and the [[Cleveland Browns]]. After posting a 1\u201311 record for the second consecutive year, the NFL franchise of just one season was dissolved by the League on January 18, 1951. But many Baltimore fans protested the loss of their team and continued to support the [[Baltimore's Marching Ravens|marching band]] (the second in professional football, after that of the [[Washington Redskins]]) and [[fan club]], both of which remained in operation (\"in exile\" status) and worked for the team's revival.\n\n===NFL Dallas Texans===\nAfter two seasons without professional football, [[History of the NFL Commissioner|NFL Commissioner]] [[Bert Bell]] challenged the [[Baltimore|City of Baltimore]] under Mayor [[Thomas D'Alesandro Jr.|Thomas L. J. D'Alesandro Jr.]], in December 1952 to sell 15,000 season tickets within six weeks in order to re-enter the NFL. That 15,000-ticket quota was reached in just four weeks and three days. On January 23, 1953, with the encouragement of the city's civic and business leadership, under the principal ownership of [[Carroll Rosenbloom]], the NFL sold [[Dallas Texans (NFL)|Dallas Texans]] franchise to Baltimore where, keeping the \"Colts\" nickname, the Texans team colors of blue and white were inherited. This is the franchise that exists today in Indianapolis in the modern National Football League.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://colts.com/sub.cfm?page=football_dynamic&id=174|title=A look at the history of the Indianapolis Colts|access-date=2012-07-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225204727/http://www.colts.com/sub.cfm?page=football_dynamic&id=174|archive-date=2010-12-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===In Baltimore===\n\n====1953\u20131967: The Johnny Unitas era====\n[[File:JohnnyUnitasSignAutograph1964.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Johnny Unitas]] was the Baltimore Colts' starting quarterback and famed \"Number 19\", from 1956 to 1972. Unitas was raised in the [[Pittsburgh]] area and played earlier for the [[University of Louisville]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]]]\n\nIn 1953, the second incarnation of the Baltimore Colts took the field for the first time ever at [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]], (then also used temporarily by the old [[Baltimore Orioles]] minor league team in the [[International League]] since the burning in July 1944 of their [[Oriole Park]] home farther southeast at [[Maryland Route 45|Greenmount Avenue]] and 29th Street in [[Waverly, Baltimore|Waverly]]). The newly renamed Memorial field was being rebuilt and adding a second upper tier to old Municipal Stadium for use by the following year of the major league baseball's [[Baltimore Orioles]] franchise in the [[American League]], relocated that November from [[St. Louis, Missouri]] as the [[St. Louis Browns]]. The 33rd Street field also then sometimes known as \"Baltimore Stadium\" or \"Venable Stadium\" for its location in the former Venable Park along the north side of the 33rd Street boulevard, constructed originally as a football-only bowl in 1922 in only seven months and later capable of holding almost 100,000 fans for the frequent high school and local collegiate/university games there during the following three decades), on September 27 to face off against the Chicago Bears. The Colts would go on to win the game 13\u20139 and stun the Bears. The team's lack of experience showed as the team finished 3\u20139. In 1955, the Colts had 12 rookies make the team. In 1956, quarterback George Shaw went down with a serious injury in the fourth game of the season. The Colts' unproven backup, Johnny Unitas, would go on to win half the remaining eight games to give the Colts a record of 5\u20137 for the season.\n\nThe Colts won their first NFL Championship in 1958. The 1958 NFL Championship game is widely known as the \"Greatest Game Ever Played\" for its dramatic conclusion with [[quarterback]] [[Johnny Unitas]] marching the Colts downfield in sudden death overtime and [[Alan Ameche]] scoring the winning touchdown on a 1-yard run. Much of the credit for Baltimore's success went to Hall of Famers Johnny Unitas, [[halfback (American football)|halfback]] [[Lenny Moore]], and [[wide receiver]] [[Raymond Berry]].\n\nFollowing the Colts' first NFL championship, the team once again posted a 9\u20133 record during the [[1959 Baltimore Colts season|1959 season]] and once again defeated the Giants in the [[1959 NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship Game]] to claim their second title in back to back fashion.<ref name=\"Baltimore Colts History\">{{cite web|title=Baltimore Colts: Historical Moments|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/balticolts/baltcolts.html|work=Sports Encyclopedia|accessdate=July 5, 2012}}</ref> Following the two championships in 1958 and 1959, the Colts did not return to the NFL Championship for four seasons and saw a transition from head coach Ewbank to a young [[Don Shula]] in [[1963 Baltimore Colts season|1963]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cole|first=Jason|title=Ewbank overlooked figure of AFL glory|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=jc-weebewbank120309|work=Yahoo!

In 1965 the Colts played the Green Bay Packers in a playoff to determine who would go to the NFL Championship game. The Colts were leading 10\u20137 over the [[Green Bay Packers]] with two minutes left to play when the Packers' kicker, [[Don Chandler]] seemed to barely miss a field goal. <ref>John F. Steadman, ''From Colts to Ravens''. 1997 Tidewater Publishers, pp 164-167</ref>The referee called it good however, and the Packers went on to win the game in overtime. The error precipitated changes to the rules: the NFL decided two referees would judge future field goals, and that the uprights should be raised by ten feet. In [[1968 Baltimore Colts season|1968]] the Colts returned with the continued leadership of Unitas and Shula and went on to win the Colts' third NFL Championship and made an appearance in [[Super Bowl III]].

The Colts 1977 playoff loss in double overtime against the Oakland Raiders was famous for the fact that it was the last playoff game for the Colts in Baltimore and is also known for the [[Ghost to the Post]] play. These consecutive playoff teams featured 1976 NFL Most Valuable Player [[Bert Jones]] at quarterback and an outstanding defensive line, nicknamed the \"Sack Pack.\"\n\n====1976\u20131983: Last days of the Baltimore Colts====\nFollowing this relative success in the 1970s, the Colts suffered a string of disappointing seasons, often finishing in last place in their division. Attendance began to dwindle in the early 1970s and remained that way for the rest of the team's tenure in Baltimore. The Colts would endure nine consecutive losing seasons beginning in [[1978 NFL season|1978]]. In [[1981 Baltimore Colts season|1981]], the Colts defense allowed an NFL-record 533 points, set an all-time record for fewest sacks (13), and also set a modern record for fewest punt returns (12).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/clt/1981.htm|title=1981 Baltimore Colts Statistics|accessdate=July 4, 2012|work=Pro Football Reference}}</ref> The following year, the offense collapsed, including a game against the [[Buffalo Bills]] where the Colts' offense did not cross mid-field the entire game.

Baltimore was unsuccessful at persuading them to stay, so the city government attempted to get the state legislature to condemn the Colts franchise and give ownership to another group that would promise to keep the Colts in Baltimore. [[Oakland, California]] had just had some success in court trying the same tactic with the [[Oakland Raiders]]. Under the threat of eminent domain from the city of Baltimore, [[Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis|the franchise relocated to Indianapolis]] in the middle of the night on March 29, 1984. \n\nThe city of Baltimore did not give up and sued to condemn the franchise anyway and seize ownership. Baltimore did not prevail in court,<ref>''Mayor & City Council of Baltimore v. Indianapolis Colts'', 624 F.Supp. 278 (D.Md. 1985)</ref> but eventually acquired a new NFL team in 1996 with the establishment of the [[Baltimore Ravens]] following the [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy]].\n\nMany former Colts players were infuriated by the move.
