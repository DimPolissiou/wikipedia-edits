Even though they were left without light or fresh air, as the SDF had shut down all electricity to the dam, and without means to communicate with their allies because the coalition jammed their radio frequencies, these ISIL fighters had resisted attempts to clear them out for weeks. The second, bigger holdout was in northern Tabqa city, where around 50 ISIL militants still defended a number of highly fortified apartments. In course of 10 May, however, this last resistance was finally broken,<ref name=\"handful\" /> when the remaining ISIL defenders surrendered or fled. According to the [[United States Central Command]], the Islamists had acceded to SDF's demand of dismantling the [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]] surrounding the dam.

Even though they were left without light or fresh air, as the SDF had shut down all electricity to the dam, and without means to communicate with their allies because the coalition jammed their radio frequencies, these ISIL fighters had resisted attempts to clear them out for weeks. The second, bigger holdout was in northern Tabqa city, where around 50 ISIL militants still defended a number of highly fortified apartments. In course of 10 May, however, this last resistance was finally broken,<ref name=\"handful\" /> when the remaining ISIL defenders surrendered or fled. According to the [[United States Central Command]], the Islamists had acceded to SDF's demand of dismantling the [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]] surrounding the dam.

In early April, [[Warsaw City Council]] stated that there had been 32 COVID-19 deaths in Warsaw, while official statistics only listed eight. The Minister of Health stated that the difference was that deaths were officially allocated according to the official places of residence of the deceased. The mayor of Warsaw, [[Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski]], stated that the data were carefully checked, and that 18 of the 32 were registered as officially living in Warsaw, not eight.<ref name=\"TVN_8vs18_Warsaw\" />\n\n''OKO.press'' claimed that two COVID-19 deaths at a [[Ministry of Interior and Administration (Poland)|Ministry of Interior and Administration]] hospital in Warsaw, on 19 March 2020 of a man born in 1942 who had returned from Austria<ref name=\"OKOpress_19Mar_MZ1death_clarified\" /> and on 24 March of a psychiatric patient, were not announced by the Ministry of Health.<ref name=\"OKOpress_20Mar_24Mar_MZ2deaths\" /> On 26 March, the family of the man born in 1942 claimed that his 19 March death had not been announced.<ref name=\"OKOpress_19Mar_MZ1death_clarified\" /> On the same day, 26 March, the Ministry of Health announced the death of a 78-year-old man in Warsaw.<ref name=\"MOHPL_2deaths_tot16_26mar\" />\n\nDisagreement between local media, the head of the [[Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship]], and GIS continued for several days in early April in relation to the 4 April death in a [[Grudzi\u0105dz]] hospital of a 64-year-old woman from Grudzi\u0105dz who was SARS-CoV-2 positive.<ref name=\"OtoTorun_64yroldCOVID19_Grudziadz\" /> ''{{ill|Gazeta Pomorska|pl}}'' stated that the head of the voivodeship only accepted including the 64-year-old's death in official reports after the newspaper \"intervened\". {{As of|2020|04|08}}, according to ''Gazeta Pomorska'', the Ministry of Health still listed only one COVID-19 death from Grudzi\u0105dz (that of an 80-year-old), while local branches of the health agency stated zero SARS-CoV-2 infections from Grudzi\u0105dz in their reports.<ref name=\"GPomorska_64yroldCOVID19\" />\n\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic data/Poland medical cases}}\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus outbreak data/Poland medical cases by voivodeship}}\n\n=== SARS-CoV-2 cases and COVID-19 deaths in Poland: bigger graphs ===\nThe information in the ''[[#Timeline|COVID-19 cases in Poland]]'' and ''SARS-CoV-2 cases and COVID-19 deaths in Poland'' graphs above can be seen in more detail in the graphs below.

He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category ''U07.2'' implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll.<ref name=\"NewsweekPl_Karczmarek\" /><ref name=\"Polityka_U07p2_ignored\" /> NIPH\u2013NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the ''U07.2'' definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases.<ref name=\"GazWyb_U072\" /> NIPH\u2013NIH stated that the WHO considered it \"irrelevant\" to distinguish between ''U07.1'' and ''U07.2''. On 6 April, Bartosz Fia\u0142ek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH\u2013NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that ''U07.2'' was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine.<ref name=\"OKOpress_U07p2_stillunclear\" />\n\n===Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine===\nOn 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in [[G\u0142og\u00f3w]] after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police.

He was born after eight years of childless marriage.\n\n==Life==\nRupert's father died in 1364, leaving him and his four siblings under the guardianship of his uncle [[Ludwik I the Fair|Louis I the Fair]]. One year later, with his cousin [[Henry VII of Brzeg|Henry VII with a Scar]] -Louis's son-, Rupert joined to the [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles IV]]'s trip to be crowned King of [[Arles]]. Rupert visited then another French cities, including [[Avignon]], where he obtained from the [[Pope Urban V]] the annulment of the excommunication over his late father.\n\nIn 1370 he participated in the Sejm [[Reich]] in [[Nuremberg]], where for the first time, Rupert manifest his political views.\n\nThe regency of Louis I the Fair was longer: only in 1373 Rupert began his personal rule over Legnica. Despite the inclusion of his brother [[Wenceslaus II of Legnica|Wenceslaus II]] as a co-rule, Rupert maintain the full government over the Duchy, but always with the close cooperation of his uncle. Thanks to the pressure of Louis, Rupert signed an agreement with his younger brothers on 2 December 1372, under which they accepted not divided the Duchy of Legnica between them for the next ten years. The agreement was extended in subsequent years, and allowed Rupert to exercise full control over Legnica at expense of his younger brothers, who, although they are co-rulers, none of them had any real power.\n\nIn later years, Rupert was actively involved in the dynastic struggles over the Silesian inheritance. On 21 May 1379 was concluded a treaty between Rupert and [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|King Wenceslaus IV]], who stipulated that after Rupert's homage to Wenceslaus as his vassal, the King guaranteed his total possession over the inheritance of all the descendants of [[Boles\u0142aw III the Generous]].
