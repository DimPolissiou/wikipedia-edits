{"title_page": "Nursing in the United Kingdom", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=August 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2016}}\n'''Nursing''' in the United Kingdom has a long history. The current form of nursing is often considered as beginning with [[Florence Nightingale]] who pioneered \"modern nursing\".  Nightingale initiated formal schools of nursing in the United Kingdom in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The role and perception of nursing has dramatically changed from that of \"handmaiden\" to the doctor to professionals in their own right. There are over 300,000 nurses in the United Kingdom and they work in a variety of settings, such as [[hospitals]], [[Clinic|health centres]], [[nursing homes]], [[hospice]]s, communities, and [[academia]], with most nurses working for the [[National Health Service]] (NHS). Nurses work across all demographics and requirements of the public: adults, children, mental health, and learning disability. Nurses work in a range of specialties from the broad areas of medicine, surgery, theatres, and investigative sciences such as imaging. Nurses also work in a large areas of sub-specialities such as respiratory, diabetes, neurology, infectious diseases, liver, [[Nursing research|research]], cardiac, and stoma. Nurses often work in multi-disciplinary teams but increasingly are found working independently.\n\nTo practise, all nurses in the United Kingdom must be registered with the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]] (NMC).\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Nursing in the United Kingdom}}\n\n===Florence Nightingale===\n{{Main|Florence Nightingale}}\n\n[[Image:Florence Nightingale.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Florence Nightingale]] [[Florence Nightingale]] is regarded as the founder of the modern nursing profession.<ref name=\":1\">Elizabeth Goodrick, and Trish Reay. \"Florence Nightingale endures: Legitimizing a new professional role identity.\" ''Journal of Management Studies'' (2010) 47#1 pp: 55\u201384.</ref> There was no real hospital training school for nurses until one was established in [[D\u00fcsseldorf-Kaiserswerth|Kaiserwerth]], Germany, in 1846. There, Nightingale received the training that later enabled her to establish, at [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in London, the [[Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery|first school]] designed primarily to train nurses rather than to provide nursing service for the hospital.\n\nIn the [[Crimean War]] against Russia, Nightingale was appointed to oversee the introduction of female nurses into the military hospitals in Turkey. In November 1854, Nightingale arrived at the barrack hospital near [[Constantinople]], with a party of 38 nurses. Initially the doctors did not want the nurses there and did not ask for their help, but within ten days fresh casualties arrived from the [[Battle of Inkermann]] and the nurses were fully stretched. When Nightingale returned from the Crimean War in August 1856, she hid herself away from the public's attention. For her contribution to Army statistics and comparative hospital statistics in 1860, Nightingale became the first woman to be elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Statistical Society|Statistical Society]].\n\n=== Betsi Cadwaladr ===\n{{main|Betsi Cadwaladr}}\nAnother nurse active in the  care of soldiers in the Crimean War was a Welsh nurse, [[Betsi Cadwaladr]], who drastically reformed the hospital at Balaclava.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\">''Welsh National Heroes'' by Alun Roberts, Y Lolfa, 2002</ref>\n\n== Regulation ==\nTo practise lawfully as a registered nurse in the United Kingdom, the practitioner must hold a current and valid registration with the Nursing and Midwifery Council. The title \"registered nurse\" can only be granted to those holding such registration; this protected title is laid down in the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act 1997.<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/24 Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act 1997]</ref>\n\n===Nursing and Midwifery Council===\n\n{{Main|Nursing and Midwifery Council}}\n\nThe core function of the NMC is to establish and improve standards of nursing and midwifery care to protect the public. Its key tasks are to:\n*register all nurses and midwives and ensure that they are properly qualified and competent to work in the UK.\n*set the standards of training and conduct that nurses and midwives need to deliver high quality healthcare consistently throughout their careers.\n*set the standards for pre-registration nursing education\n*ensure that nurses and midwives keep their skills and knowledge up to date and uphold the standards of their professional code.\n*ensure that midwives are safe to practise by setting rules for their practice and supervision.\n*use fair processes to investigate allegations made against nurses and midwives who may not have followed the code.\n\nThe powers of the NMC are set out in the Nursing and Midwifery Order 2001.<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/253 Nursing and Midwifery Order 2001]</ref>\n\nMembership of the council comprises 6 lay and 6 registrant members appointed by the Privy Council, including at least one member from each of the four UK countries. The registrant members consist of nurses and midwives. The lay members currently include people with diplomatic, legal and business backgrounds.\n\n====Register====\n\nThe [[Nursing and Midwifery Council|NMC]] register is split into three main parts: Nurses, Midwives and Specialist Community Public Health Nurses (SCPHN). Within the registration it contains several \"sub-parts\" and qualifications e.g. sub part 1, sub part 2.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Registration and qualification codes|url = http://www.nmc.org.uk/registration/staying-on-the-register/your-statement-of-entry/registration-and-qualification-codes/|website = www.nmc.org.uk|access-date = 2016-02-03}}</ref>\n\nThere are{{when| date= May 2019}} over 618,000 registered Nurses, Midwives and SCPHNs.

The ward hierarchy consists of:\n* '''Dental Nurses''' \u2013 works as part of a dental team in a variety of clinical and non-clinical settings. Dental Nurses attract a Band 4 salary but can move up to Band 5 in management roles.\n* '''Staff Nurses/General Nurse/Staffer of Nursing''' \u2013 the first grade of qualified nursing staff. These nurses are responsible for a set group of patients (e.g. administering medications, assessing, venepuncture, wound care and other clinical duties). Under Agenda for Change they attract a Band 5 salary but sometimes a Band 6 salary.\n* '''Senior staff nurses/Staffer Manager''' \u2013 these nurses carry out many of the same tasks, but are more senior and more experienced than the staff nurses. Many NHS Trusts do not have Senior Staff Nurses as the role is seen to be superfluous.\n* '''Junior/Deputy Ward Sister; Charge Nurse; Deputy Ward Manager''' \u2013 responsible for the day-to-day running of the ward, and may also carry specific responsibilities for the overall running of the ward (e.g. rostering) in accordance with the wishes of the ward manager. These nurses are assigned band 6. In some NHS Trusts, these will be known as Sisters/Charge Nurses.\n* '''Ward Manager/Ward Sister/Charge Nurse/Nurse Manager/Clinical Ward Nurse Lead''' \u2013 this nurse is responsible for running a ward or unit, and usually has budgetary control. He/she will employ staff, and be responsible for all the local management (e.g. rostering, approving pay claims, purchasing equipment, delegation duties or tasks). These nurses are band 7. They are generally Senior Staff Nurses or Charge Nurses as well.\n* '''Senior Ward Sister; Senior Charge Nurse; Senior Ward Manager''' \u2013 if there is a need to employ several nurses at a ward manager level (e.g. in [[emergency department|A&E]]), then one of them often acts as the senior ward manager. These nurses attract a banding anywhere between 7 and 8c.\nThere are also positions which exist above the ward level:\n* '''Clinical Nurse Manager/ Nurse Lead''' \u2013 A nurse who is responsible for an entire directorate/department (i.e. Surgical, Medical Diagnostic & Imaging etc.) or at least more than one ward, is often referred to as a ''clinical nurse manager''. Depending on both the inclination of the NHS Trust and themselves, they may be more or less involved in actual clinical nursing or management on a clinical level. These nurses attract band 8a (or occasionally 8b/8c) under Agenda for Change.\n* '''Modern Matrons/Nursing Director/Nurse Matron''' \u2013 developed in response to some patients' perception of the detachment of nursing from its vocational history, the modern matron is responsible for overseeing all nursing within a department or directorate. Modern matrons are employed on bands 8a-c. See Matron for more details of this role and its historical roots. Modern matrons were poorly received by the majority of nursing staff and their imposition was not called for by any professional group within the health service.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\nThe status in the hierarchy of specialist nurses is variable, as each specialist nurse has a slightly different role within their respective NHS organisation. They are generally experienced nurses, however, and are employed at least on band 6.\n\n===Specialist nurses===\nThere are increasing roles for specialist nurses who generally have many years of experience in their field, in addition to extra education and training. They can be split into several major groups:\n* '''[[Nurse practitioners]]''' \u2013 These nurses carry out care at an advanced practice level. They often perform roles similar to those of doctors. They commonly work in [[primary care]] (e.g. GP surgeries) or [[emergency department|A&E departments]], although they are increasingly being seen in other areas of practice.\n* '''Specialist Community Public Health Nurses''' \u2013 Traditionally known as [[District Nurse]]s and Health Visitors, this group of practitioners now includes many [[school nurse]]s and [[Occupational Health]] Nurses.\n* '''Clinical Nurse Specialists''' \u2013 Those undertaking these roles commonly provide clinical leadership and education for the Staff Nurses working in their department, and will also have special skills and knowledge which ward nurses can draw upon.\n* '''Nurse Consultants''' \u2013 These nurses are similar in many ways to the clinical nurse specialist, but at a higher level. These practitioners are responsible for clinical education and training of those in their department, and many also have active research and publication activities.\n* '''Lecturer-Practitioners''' \u2013 These nurses work both in the NHS and in universities. They typically work for 2\u20133 days per week in each setting. In university, they may train pre-registration student nurses (see below), and often teach on specialist courses for post-registration nurses (e.g. a Lecturer-practitioner in critical care may teach a master's degree course in critical care nursing). Lecturer-Practitioners are now more often referred to by the more common job title of [[Practice Education Facilitators]] (shortened by student nurses to PEFs).\n* '''Lecturers''' \u2013 These nurses are not employed by the NHS. Instead they work full-time in universities, both teaching and performing research. Typically lecturers in nursing are qualified to a minimum of a master's degree and some are also qualified to PhD level. Some senior lecturers also attain the title of Professor. This title is more often the School/Department [[Dean (education)|Dean]] e.g. Dean/Vice Dean School of Health & Social Care.\n* '''Managers''' \u2013 Many nurses who have worked in clinical settings for a long time choose to leave clinical nursing and join the ranks of the NHS and independent care sector management. This used to be seen as a natural career progression for those who had reached ward management positions; however with the advent of specialist nursing roles (see above), this has become a less attractive option. Nonetheless, many nurses fill positions in the senior management structure of NHS organisations and independent healthcare organisations, some even as board members or directors. Others choose to stay a little closer to their clinical roots by becoming regional managers, service managers, clinical nurse managers or [[Matron|Modern Matrons]].\n\n{{See also|List of nursing specialties}}\n\n== Nursing Assessment Tools ==\n\n=== Initial Assessments and Observations ===\n[[ABC (medicine)|ABCDE]] \u2013 Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability and Exposure\n\n[[Early warning score|NEWS]] \u2013 National Early Warning Score\n\n=== Holistic Assessments ===\n[[Activities of daily living]] \u2013\n\n=== Pain Assessments ===\n[[Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale|Wong Baker Faces]] \u2013\n\nPAINAD \u2013\n\n=== General Assessment Tools ===\n[[Waterlow score]] \u2013\n\nMUST \u2013 Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool\n\n==Nurse education==\n[[File:Nursing acceptances.png|thumb|460px|People accepted onto undergraduate nursing courses in the UK 2008-2016<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ucas.com/file/84191/download?token=985YirUd#page=2 |title=UCAS Acceptances by subject}}</ref>]]\n\n===Non-registered staff education===\nThere is no mandatory training for most people undertaking non-registered staff roles such as a Healthcare Assistant. But the majority of NHS employers have developed \"in-house\" training for these members of staff, including both induction programmes and ongoing education to achieve a recognised qualification. Some collaborate with local further education colleges to provide theoretical input, and may award a recognised qualification. It is becoming more common for NHS employers to ask for some type of health or social care qualification for potential recruits: for example, an [[Scottish Vocational Qualification|SVQ]]/[[NVQ]] or [[Higher National Certificate|HNC]]/[[Higher National Diploma|HND]] with various qualification names including health care, [[social care]] and [[health & social care]].\n\nMany trusts and health boards create opportunities for these staff members to become qualified nurses. This is known as secondment (whereby the trust/health board continues to pay them for the duration of their training, and often guarantees employment as qualified nurses following the completion of their training).\n\n===Pre-registration education===\nTo become a registered nurse one must complete a nursing [[academic degree|degree]] programme recognised by the Nursing and Midwifery Council from an approved provider i.e. [[:Category:Nursing schools in the United Kingdom|universities offering these courses]].\n\n====Education format====\nA nursing course is a 50/50 split of learning in university (lectures and examinations) and in practice (supervised patient care within a hospital or community setting). Nursing courses usually take three years and are 4,600 hours in length, which is split 50%/50% between theory and clinical placements as set out as a requirement of the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council|NMC]]. Graduate courses are provided and are two years in length. Graduate courses often require prior learning and relevant healthcare experience; this can be referred to as APEL (Accreditation of Prior and Experiential Learning).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/nursing/study/applicants/preregistration/apel.aspx|title=King's College London \u2013 APEL claim form for PGDip applicants|website=www.kcl.ac.uk|access-date=2016-10-07}}</ref>\n\nThere are four different branches of nursing offered at university level (not including midwifery):\n\n* Adult nursing\n* Child nursing\n* Mental health nursing\n* Learning disabilities nursing\n\n====Nursing Diploma====\nState Enrolled Nurses (SENs) were formally recognised in the 1940s, and training took place in hospitals. Nursing education remained closely linked to the hospital where nurses were placed and often lived.\n\n====Project 2000; The Nursing degree====\n[[Project 2000]] began in 1990 and was designed to move nursing education from hospitals into universities. Prior to Project 2000, nurse education was the responsibility of hospitals and was not based in universities; many nurses who qualified prior to these reforms do not hold an academic award.\n\nFrom September 2013, all nurse training programmes must be at degree level, with no option to study instead for a diploma.\n\n====Midwifery education====\n[[Midwifery]] training is similar in length and structure, but is sufficiently different that it is not considered a branch of nursing. There are shortened (18-month) programmes to allow nurses already qualified in the adult branch to hold dual registration as a nurse and a midwife. Shortened courses lasting two years also exist for graduates of other disciplines to train as nurses. This is achieved by more intense study and a shortening of the common foundation programme.\n\n====NHS Student Bursary====\nStudent nurses in England and Wales no longer receive a [[bursary]] from the government to support them during their nurse training. Diploma students in England receive a non-means-tested bursary of around \u00a36,000 \u2013 \u00a38,000 per year (with additional allowances for students with dependant children), whereas degree students have their bursary means tested (and often receive considerably less). Degree students are, however, eligible for a proportion of the government's [[student loan]], unlike diploma students. But in [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]], all student nurses (regardless of which course they are undertaking) receive the same bursary in line with the English diploma course. All student nurses in Wales study, initially, for a degree, but may choose to remain at Level 2 for their third year, thereby achieving a diploma rather than a degree.\n\nIt was announced in the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]]'s Spending Review of November 2015 that from 2017 the NHS bursary would be removed for all future nursing, midwifery and allied health professionals. This would apply only to student nurses in England, with Welsh & Scottish students remaining unaffected.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/34926620/spending-review-grants-for-student-nurses-are-being-scrapped|title=Spending Review: Grants for student nurses are being scrapped|access-date=2016-10-07}}</ref>\n\n===Post-registration education===\n\nAfter the point of initial registration, there is an expectation that all qualified nurses will continue to update their skills and knowledge. The Nursing and Midwifery Council insists on a minimum of 35 hours of education every three years, as part of its post-registration education and practice (PREP) requirements.\n\nThere are also opportunities for many nurses to gain additional clinical skills after qualification. [[Cannulation]], [[venepuncture]], [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous drug therapy]] and [[urinary catheterization|male catheterisation]] are the most common, although there are many others (such as [[Advanced Life Support]]) which some nurses will undertake.\n\nMany nurses who qualified with a diploma can choose to upgrade their qualification to a degree by studying part-time. Many nurses prefer this option to gaining a degree initially, as there is often an opportunity to study in a specialist field as a part of this upgrading.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In England, it is also much more financially lucrative, as diploma students get the full bursary during their initial training, and employers often pay for the degree course as well as the nurse's salary. However, from September 2013 onwards all students can only study at degree level, while diplomas are gradually being phased out permanently.<ref>NHS Careers . Entry requirements for nursing. Available: http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/details/default.aspx?id=1944.</ref>\n\nTo become specialist nurses (such as nurse consultants, nurse practitioners, etc.) or nurse educators, some nurses undertake further training above bachelor's degree level. Master's degrees exist in various healthcare related topics, and some nurses choose to study for PhDs or other higher academic awards. [[District nurse]]s and health visitors are also considered specialist nurses, and to become such they must undertake specialist training (often in the form of a top-up degree (see above) or post graduate diploma).\n\nAll newly qualified district nurses and health visitors are trained to prescribe from the [[Nurse Prescribers' Formulary]], a list of medications and dressings typically useful to those carrying out these roles. Many of these (and other) nurses will also undertake training in independent and supplementary prescribing, which allowed them (as of 1 May 2006) to prescribe almost any drug in the [[British National Formulary]]. This was the cause of a great deal of debate in both medical and nursing circles.<ref>Wilson, J., Bunnel, T. (2007) A review of the merits of the nurse practitioner role. ''Nursing Standard'' Vol. 21(18) pp. 35\u201340</ref>\nHowever, as of 2012 there were over 25,000 Nurse Prescribers. Nurse Prescribing had become a mainstream role within nursing, accepted by not only healthcare professionals but also patients. After a historic change in legislation (which came into force in England on 23 April 2012) nurse prescribers may now prescribe exactly the same medicines as Doctors (including Controlled Drugs). A common set of prescribing competencies was published in May 2012 by the National Prescribing Centre for all prescribing professionals.\n\n== Overseas Nurses in the UK ==\nThe Nurses and Midwifery Council has specific process for inducting Registered Nurses trained outside UK / EU. Prior to October 2016 an outside UK RN would have to undergo an Overseas Nursing Program known in short as the ONP. The ONP had to be undertaken by the candidate after NMC makes necessary checks and issue the candidate with a decision letter stating that the person may join a university to undertake the ONP. However, due to shortage of nurses and NMC striving for gold standards in nursing they have now updated their new process to a two part test of competence. The first part is called CBT and Part 2 (objective structured clinical examination (OSCE).<ref>https://www.nmc.org.uk/registration/joining-the-register/trained-outside-the-eueea/</ref>\n\n== Protests ==\n\n===NHS Student protests #BursaryorBust===\nIn the November 2015 spending review,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/25/public-service-winners-and-losers-in-spending-review|title=Public service winners and losers in spending review|last=Campbell|first=Denis|date=25 November 2015|work=|last2=Travis|first2=Alan|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|last3=Adams|first3=Richard|last4=Brown|first4=Mark|last5=Booth|first5=Robert|last6=Carrington|first6=Damian|access-date=2016-10-07|via=}}</ref> [[George Osborne]] stated that he would remove the NHS Student Bursary from 2017.

The [[Royal College of Nursing]] had a no-strike policy for 79 years until 1995, when the policy was dropped due to pay disputes at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12107034.RCN_votes_to_drop_no_strike_policy/|title=RCN votes to drop no-strike policy|website=Herald Scotland|access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref>\n\nIn 1939 rallied together{{clarify|date=March 2016}} as it was reported in the ''Daily Mirror'' that many nurses were leaving the role and were enduring financial hardship.\n\nIn 1948, following the establishment of the NHS, nurses realised that their pay had decreased, which led to strike action.\n\nIn 1962 many nurses marched to Trafalgar Square as part of pay disputes under the banner of \"Empty Purses Mean Less Nurses\".\n\nIn 1970 many nurses protested at pay and conditions.\n\nIn 1973 it was reported that over 7,000 nurses marched in Sheffield.\n\nIn 1974 several protests took place by nurses over pay and conditions.\n\nIn 1976 many nurses took part in a low pay strike.\n\nIn 1982 there was a National Health Service day of action with 120,000 workers marching at various locations around the country including many nurses.\n\nIn 1988 Nurses went on strike in 1988 over pay and proposed changes to the NHS.\n\nIn 2011 Unison nurses protested and marched over pay.\n\nIn 2014 Midwives and some nurses went on strike over pay.\n\nIn 2015 nursing students protested outside the Department of Health over the removal of the NHS student bursary.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/15/student-nurses-bursaries-protest-cuts-recruit-loans-fees|title=For us student nurses, bursaries are a lifeline.

Agenda for Change was developed by the NHS in response to criticisms that the old scale reflected length of service more than knowledge, responsibility and skills.\n\n===Clinical grading===\nThis was known as the [[Whitley Council]] system. This placed nurses (and some other hospital staff) on \"grades\" between A and I (with A being the most junior, and I the most senior). Unregistered staff were employed on grades A and B (occasionally grade C). Second level nurses were employed on various grades (usually between C and E), with first level nurses taking up grades D-I.\n\n===Agenda for Change===\n{{Main|Agenda for Change}}\n\nThis system puts registered staff on bands 5\u20138, unregistered staff such as Healthcare Assistants take up bands 2\u20134. Band 9 posts are for the most senior members of NHS management. Each band contains a number of pay points.\n\nThe idea of this system is \"equal pay for work of equal value\". There was a perceived discrepancy, under clinical grading, between ones grade (and therefore pay) and the work which one actually did, which Agenda for Change aimed to fix.

The current form of nursing is often considered as beginning with [[Florence Nightingale]] who pioneered \"modern nursing\".  Nightingale initiated formal schools of nursing in the United Kingdom in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The role and perception of nursing has dramatically changed from that of \"handmaiden\" to the doctor to professionals in their own right. There are over 300,000 nurses in the United Kingdom and they work in a variety of settings, such as [[hospitals]], [[Clinic|health centres]], [[nursing homes]], [[hospice]]s, communities, and [[academia]], with most nurses working for the [[National Health Service]] (NHS). Nurses work across all demographics and requirements of the public: adults, children, mental health, and learning disability. Nurses work in a range of specialties from the broad areas of medicine, surgery, theatres, and investigative sciences such as imaging. Nurses also work in a large areas of sub-specialities such as respiratory, diabetes, neurology, infectious diseases, liver, [[Nursing research|research]], cardiac, and stoma. Nurses often work in multi-disciplinary teams but increasingly are found working independently.\n\nTo practise, all nurses in the United Kingdom must be registered with the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]] (NMC).\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Nursing in the United Kingdom}}\n\n===Florence Nightingale===\n{{Main|Florence Nightingale}}\n\n[[Image:Florence Nightingale.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Florence Nightingale]] [[Florence Nightingale]] is regarded as the founder of the modern nursing profession.<ref name=\":1\">Elizabeth Goodrick, and Trish Reay. \"Florence Nightingale endures: Legitimizing a new professional role identity.\" ''Journal of Management Studies'' (2010) 47#1 pp: 55\u201384.</ref> There was no real hospital training school for nurses until one was established in [[D\u00fcsseldorf-Kaiserswerth|Kaiserwerth]], Germany, in 1846. There, Nightingale received the training that later enabled her to establish, at [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in London, the [[Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery|first school]] designed primarily to train nurses rather than to provide nursing service for the hospital.\n\nIn the [[Crimean War]] against Russia, Nightingale was appointed to oversee the introduction of female nurses into the military hospitals in Turkey. In November 1854, Nightingale arrived at the barrack hospital near [[Constantinople]], with a party of 38 nurses. Initially the doctors did not want the nurses there and did not ask for their help, but within ten days fresh casualties arrived from the [[Battle of Inkermann]] and the nurses were fully stretched. When Nightingale returned from the Crimean War in August 1856, she hid herself away from the public's attention. For her contribution to Army statistics and comparative hospital statistics in 1860, Nightingale became the first woman to be elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Statistical Society|Statistical Society]].\n\n=== Betsi Cadwaladr ===\n{{main|Betsi Cadwaladr}}\nAnother nurse active in the  care of soldiers in the Crimean War was a Welsh nurse, [[Betsi Cadwaladr]], who drastically reformed the hospital at Balaclava.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\">''Welsh National Heroes'' by Alun Roberts, Y Lolfa, 2002</ref>\n\n== Regulation ==\nTo practise lawfully as a registered nurse in the United Kingdom, the practitioner must hold a current and valid registration with the Nursing and Midwifery Council.

Others can expand their ward-based role to include these tasks and others. There are few areas of nursing practice that cannot be legally performed by suitably trained non-registered staff, although they cannot fully replace them, as they legally must be supervised (either directly or indirectly) by a fully qualified registered nurse.\n\nIn 2019 it was reported that less qualified support workers were increasingly covering shifts because of the national shortage of mental health nurses.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tripling in support workers substituting for nurses shows practice is \u2018the new normal\u2019 |url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/north-staffordshire-combined-healthcare-nhs-trust/tripling-in-support-workers-substituting-for-nurses-shows-practice-is-the-new-normal/7025840.article? |accessdate=31 October 2019 |publisher=Health Service Journal |date=30 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Healthcare Assistant ===\nNon-registered staff have various job titles such as \"clinical support worker\", \"care assistant\", \"nursing assistant\" and \"healthcare assistant\" (HCA).

The ward hierarchy consists of:\n* '''Dental Nurses''' \u2013 works as part of a dental team in a variety of clinical and non-clinical settings. Dental Nurses attract a Band 4 salary but can move up to Band 5 in management roles.\n* '''Staff Nurses/General Nurse/Staffer of Nursing''' \u2013 the first grade of qualified nursing staff. These nurses are responsible for a set group of patients (e.g. administering medications, assessing, venepuncture, wound care and other clinical duties). Under Agenda for Change they attract a Band 5 salary but sometimes a Band 6 salary.\n* '''Senior staff nurses/Staffer Manager''' \u2013 these nurses carry out many of the same tasks, but are more senior and more experienced than the staff nurses. Many NHS Trusts do not have Senior Staff Nurses as the role is seen to be superfluous.\n* '''Junior/Deputy Ward Sister; Charge Nurse; Deputy Ward Manager''' \u2013 responsible for the day-to-day running of the ward, and may also carry specific responsibilities for the overall running of the ward (e.g. rostering) in accordance with the wishes of the ward manager. These nurses are assigned band 6. In some NHS Trusts, these will be known as Sisters/Charge Nurses.\n* '''Ward Manager/Ward Sister/Charge Nurse/Nurse Manager/Clinical Ward Nurse Lead''' \u2013 this nurse is responsible for running a ward or unit, and usually has budgetary control. He/she will employ staff, and be responsible for all the local management (e.g. rostering, approving pay claims, purchasing equipment, delegation duties or tasks). These nurses are band 7. They are generally Senior Staff Nurses or Charge Nurses as well.\n* '''Senior Ward Sister; Senior Charge Nurse; Senior Ward Manager''' \u2013 if there is a need to employ several nurses at a ward manager level (e.g. in [[emergency department|A&E]]), then one of them often acts as the senior ward manager. These nurses attract a banding anywhere between 7 and 8c.\nThere are also positions which exist above the ward level:\n* '''Clinical Nurse Manager/ Nurse Lead''' \u2013 A nurse who is responsible for an entire directorate/department (i.e. Surgical, Medical Diagnostic & Imaging etc.) or at least more than one ward, is often referred to as a ''clinical nurse manager''. Depending on both the inclination of the NHS Trust and themselves, they may be more or less involved in actual clinical nursing or management on a clinical level. These nurses attract band 8a (or occasionally 8b/8c) under Agenda for Change.\n* '''Modern Matrons/Nursing Director/Nurse Matron''' \u2013 developed in response to some patients' perception of the detachment of nursing from its vocational history, the modern matron is responsible for overseeing all nursing within a department or directorate. Modern matrons are employed on bands 8a-c. See Matron for more details of this role and its historical roots. Modern matrons were poorly received by the majority of nursing staff and their imposition was not called for by any professional group within the health service.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\nThe status in the hierarchy of specialist nurses is variable, as each specialist nurse has a slightly different role within their respective NHS organisation. They are generally experienced nurses, however, and are employed at least on band 6.\n\n===Specialist nurses===\nThere are increasing roles for specialist nurses who generally have many years of experience in their field, in addition to extra education and training. They can be split into several major groups:\n* '''[[Nurse practitioners]]''' \u2013 These nurses carry out care at an advanced practice level. They often perform roles similar to those of doctors. They commonly work in [[primary care]] (e.g. GP surgeries) or [[emergency department|A&E departments]], although they are increasingly being seen in other areas of practice.\n* '''Specialist Community Public Health Nurses''' \u2013 Traditionally known as [[District Nurse]]s and Health Visitors, this group of practitioners now includes many [[school nurse]]s and [[Occupational Health]] Nurses.\n* '''Clinical Nurse Specialists''' \u2013 Those undertaking these roles commonly provide clinical leadership and education for the Staff Nurses working in their department, and will also have special skills and knowledge which ward nurses can draw upon.\n* '''Nurse Consultants''' \u2013 These nurses are similar in many ways to the clinical nurse specialist, but at a higher level. These practitioners are responsible for clinical education and training of those in their department, and many also have active research and publication activities.\n* '''Lecturer-Practitioners''' \u2013 These nurses work both in the NHS and in universities. They typically work for 2\u20133 days per week in each setting. In university, they may train pre-registration student nurses (see below), and often teach on specialist courses for post-registration nurses (e.g. a Lecturer-practitioner in critical care may teach a master's degree course in critical care nursing). Lecturer-Practitioners are now more often referred to by the more common job title of [[Practice Education Facilitators]] (shortened by student nurses to PEFs).\n* '''Lecturers''' \u2013 These nurses are not employed by the NHS. Instead they work full-time in universities, both teaching and performing research. Typically lecturers in nursing are qualified to a minimum of a master's degree and some are also qualified to PhD level. Some senior lecturers also attain the title of Professor. This title is more often the School/Department [[Dean (education)|Dean]] e.g. Dean/Vice Dean School of Health & Social Care.\n* '''Managers''' \u2013 Many nurses who have worked in clinical settings for a long time choose to leave clinical nursing and join the ranks of the NHS and independent care sector management. This used to be seen as a natural career progression for those who had reached ward management positions; however with the advent of specialist nursing roles (see above), this has become a less attractive option. Nonetheless, many nurses fill positions in the senior management structure of NHS organisations and independent healthcare organisations, some even as board members or directors. Others choose to stay a little closer to their clinical roots by becoming regional managers, service managers, clinical nurse managers or [[Matron|Modern Matrons]].\n\n{{See also|List of nursing specialties}}\n\n== Nursing Assessment Tools ==\n\n=== Initial Assessments and Observations ===\n[[ABC (medicine)|ABCDE]] \u2013 Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability and Exposure\n\n[[Early warning score|NEWS]] \u2013 National Early Warning Score\n\n=== Holistic Assessments ===\n[[Activities of daily living]] \u2013\n\n=== Pain Assessments ===\n[[Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale|Wong Baker Faces]] \u2013\n\nPAINAD \u2013\n\n=== General Assessment Tools ===\n[[Waterlow score]] \u2013\n\nMUST \u2013 Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool\n\n==Nurse education==\n[[File:Nursing acceptances.png|thumb|460px|People accepted onto undergraduate nursing courses in the UK 2008-2016<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ucas.com/file/84191/download?token=985YirUd#page=2 |title=UCAS Acceptances by subject}}</ref>]]\n\n===Non-registered staff education===\nThere is no mandatory training for most people undertaking non-registered staff roles such as a Healthcare Assistant. But the majority of NHS employers have developed \"in-house\" training for these members of staff, including both induction programmes and ongoing education to achieve a recognised qualification. Some collaborate with local further education colleges to provide theoretical input, and may award a recognised qualification. It is becoming more common for NHS employers to ask for some type of health or social care qualification for potential recruits: for example, an [[Scottish Vocational Qualification|SVQ]]/[[NVQ]] or [[Higher National Certificate|HNC]]/[[Higher National Diploma|HND]] with various qualification names including health care, [[social care]] and [[health & social care]].\n\nMany trusts and health boards create opportunities for these staff members to become qualified nurses. This is known as secondment (whereby the trust/health board continues to pay them for the duration of their training, and often guarantees employment as qualified nurses following the completion of their training).\n\n===Pre-registration education===\nTo become a registered nurse one must complete a nursing [[academic degree|degree]] programme recognised by the Nursing and Midwifery Council from an approved provider i.e. [[:Category:Nursing schools in the United Kingdom|universities offering these courses]].\n\n====Education format====\nA nursing course is a 50/50 split of learning in university (lectures and examinations) and in practice (supervised patient care within a hospital or community setting). Nursing courses usually take three years and are 4,600 hours in length, which is split 50%/50% between theory and clinical placements as set out as a requirement of the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council|NMC]]. Graduate courses are provided and are two years in length. Graduate courses often require prior learning and relevant healthcare experience; this can be referred to as APEL (Accreditation of Prior and Experiential Learning).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/nursing/study/applicants/preregistration/apel.aspx|title=King's College London \u2013 APEL claim form for PGDip applicants|website=www.kcl.ac.uk|access-date=2016-10-07}}</ref>\n\nThere are four different branches of nursing offered at university level (not including midwifery):\n\n* Adult nursing\n* Child nursing\n* Mental health nursing\n* Learning disabilities nursing\n\n====Nursing Diploma====\nState Enrolled Nurses (SENs) were formally recognised in the 1940s, and training took place in hospitals. Nursing education remained closely linked to the hospital where nurses were placed and often lived.\n\n====Project 2000; The Nursing degree====\n[[Project 2000]] began in 1990 and was designed to move nursing education from hospitals into universities. Prior to Project 2000, nurse education was the responsibility of hospitals and was not based in universities; many nurses who qualified prior to these reforms do not hold an academic award.\n\nFrom September 2013, all nurse training programmes must be at degree level, with no option to study instead for a diploma.\n\n====Midwifery education====\n[[Midwifery]] training is similar in length and structure, but is sufficiently different that it is not considered a branch of nursing. There are shortened (18-month) programmes to allow nurses already qualified in the adult branch to hold dual registration as a nurse and a midwife. Shortened courses lasting two years also exist for graduates of other disciplines to train as nurses. This is achieved by more intense study and a shortening of the common foundation programme.\n\n====NHS Student Bursary====\nStudent nurses in England and Wales no longer receive a [[bursary]] from the government to support them during their nurse training. Diploma students in England receive a non-means-tested bursary of around \u00a36,000 \u2013 \u00a38,000 per year (with additional allowances for students with dependant children), whereas degree students have their bursary means tested (and often receive considerably less). Degree students are, however, eligible for a proportion of the government's [[student loan]], unlike diploma students. But in [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]], all student nurses (regardless of which course they are undertaking) receive the same bursary in line with the English diploma course. All student nurses in Wales study, initially, for a degree, but may choose to remain at Level 2 for their third year, thereby achieving a diploma rather than a degree.\n\nIt was announced in the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]]'s Spending Review of November 2015 that from 2017 the NHS bursary would be removed for all future nursing, midwifery and allied health professionals. This would apply only to student nurses in England, with Welsh & Scottish students remaining unaffected.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/34926620/spending-review-grants-for-student-nurses-are-being-scrapped|title=Spending Review: Grants for student nurses are being scrapped|access-date=2016-10-07}}</ref>\n\n===Post-registration education===\n\nAfter the point of initial registration, there is an expectation that all qualified nurses will continue to update their skills and knowledge. The Nursing and Midwifery Council insists on a minimum of 35 hours of education every three years, as part of its post-registration education and practice (PREP) requirements.\n\nThere are also opportunities for many nurses to gain additional clinical skills after qualification. [[Cannulation]], [[venepuncture]], [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous drug therapy]] and [[urinary catheterization|male catheterisation]] are the most common, although there are many others (such as [[Advanced Life Support]]) which some nurses will undertake.\n\nMany nurses who qualified with a diploma can choose to upgrade their qualification to a degree by studying part-time. Many nurses prefer this option to gaining a degree initially, as there is often an opportunity to study in a specialist field as a part of this upgrading.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In England, it is also much more financially lucrative, as diploma students get the full bursary during their initial training, and employers often pay for the degree course as well as the nurse's salary. However, from September 2013 onwards all students can only study at degree level, while diplomas are gradually being phased out permanently.<ref>NHS Careers . Entry requirements for nursing. Available: http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/details/default.aspx?id=1944.</ref>\n\nTo become specialist nurses (such as nurse consultants, nurse practitioners, etc.) or nurse educators, some nurses undertake further training above bachelor's degree level. Master's degrees exist in various healthcare related topics, and some nurses choose to study for PhDs or other higher academic awards. [[District nurse]]s and health visitors are also considered specialist nurses, and to become such they must undertake specialist training (often in the form of a top-up degree (see above) or post graduate diploma).\n\nAll newly qualified district nurses and health visitors are trained to prescribe from the [[Nurse Prescribers' Formulary]], a list of medications and dressings typically useful to those carrying out these roles. Many of these (and other) nurses will also undertake training in independent and supplementary prescribing, which allowed them (as of 1 May 2006) to prescribe almost any drug in the [[British National Formulary]]. This was the cause of a great deal of debate in both medical and nursing circles.<ref>Wilson, J., Bunnel, T. (2007) A review of the merits of the nurse practitioner role. ''Nursing Standard'' Vol. 21(18) pp. 35\u201340</ref>\nHowever, as of 2012 there were over 25,000 Nurse Prescribers. Nurse Prescribing had become a mainstream role within nursing, accepted by not only healthcare professionals but also patients. After a historic change in legislation (which came into force in England on 23 April 2012) nurse prescribers may now prescribe exactly the same medicines as Doctors (including Controlled Drugs). A common set of prescribing competencies was published in May 2012 by the National Prescribing Centre for all prescribing professionals.\n\n== Overseas Nurses in the UK ==\nThe Nurses and Midwifery Council has specific process for inducting Registered Nurses trained outside UK / EU. Prior to October 2016 an outside UK RN would have to undergo an Overseas Nursing Program known in short as the ONP. The ONP had to be undertaken by the candidate after NMC makes necessary checks and issue the candidate with a decision letter stating that the person may join a university to undertake the ONP. However, due to shortage of nurses and NMC striving for gold standards in nursing they have now updated their new process to a two part test of competence. The first part is called CBT and Part 2 (objective structured clinical examination (OSCE).<ref>https://www.nmc.org.uk/registration/joining-the-register/trained-outside-the-eueea/</ref>\n\n== Protests ==\n\n===NHS Student protests #BursaryorBust===\nIn the November 2015 spending review,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/25/public-service-winners-and-losers-in-spending-review|title=Public service winners and losers in spending review|last=Campbell|first=Denis|date=25 November 2015|work=|last2=Travis|first2=Alan|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|last3=Adams|first3=Richard|last4=Brown|first4=Mark|last5=Booth|first5=Robert|last6=Carrington|first6=Damian|access-date=2016-10-07|via=}}</ref> [[George Osborne]] stated that he would remove the NHS Student Bursary from 2017.

Nursing, as an evidence-based area of practice, has been developing since the time of [[Florence Nightingale]] to the present day, when many nurses now work as researchers based in universities as well as in the health care setting.\n\n== Nursing Industrial Action ==\nWhilst nurses are not known for striking or taking industrial action, there have been many occasions when nurses have gone on strike, often over pay and conditions. The [[Royal College of Nursing]] had a no-strike policy for 79 years until 1995, when the policy was dropped due to pay disputes at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12107034.RCN_votes_to_drop_no_strike_policy/|title=RCN votes to drop no-strike policy|website=Herald Scotland|access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref>\n\nIn 1939 rallied together{{clarify|date=March 2016}} as it was reported in the ''Daily Mirror'' that many nurses were leaving the role and were enduring financial hardship.\n\nIn 1948, following the establishment of the NHS, nurses realised that their pay had decreased, which led to strike action.\n\nIn 1962 many nurses marched to Trafalgar Square as part of pay disputes under the banner of \"Empty Purses Mean Less Nurses\".\n\nIn 1970 many nurses protested at pay and conditions.\n\nIn 1973 it was reported that over 7,000 nurses marched in Sheffield.\n\nIn 1974 several protests took place by nurses over pay and conditions.\n\nIn 1976 many nurses took part in a low pay strike.\n\nIn 1982 there was a National Health Service day of action with 120,000 workers marching at various locations around the country including many nurses.\n\nIn 1988 Nurses went on strike in 1988 over pay and proposed changes to the NHS.\n\nIn 2011 Unison nurses protested and marched over pay.\n\nIn 2014 Midwives and some nurses went on strike over pay.\n\nIn 2015 nursing students protested outside the Department of Health over the removal of the NHS student bursary.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/15/student-nurses-bursaries-protest-cuts-recruit-loans-fees|title=For us student nurses, bursaries are a lifeline.

Agenda for Change was developed by the NHS in response to criticisms that the old scale reflected length of service more than knowledge, responsibility and skills.\n\n===Clinical grading===\nThis was known as the [[Whitley Council]] system. This placed nurses (and some other hospital staff) on \"grades\" between A and I (with A being the most junior, and I the most senior). Unregistered staff were employed on grades A and B (occasionally grade C). Second level nurses were employed on various grades (usually between C and E), with first level nurses taking up grades D-I.\n\n===Agenda for Change===\n{{Main|Agenda for Change}}\n\nThis system puts registered staff on bands 5\u20138, unregistered staff such as Healthcare Assistants take up bands 2\u20134. Band 9 posts are for the most senior members of NHS management. Each band contains a number of pay points.\n\nThe idea of this system is \"equal pay for work of equal value\". There was a perceived discrepancy, under clinical grading, between ones grade (and therefore pay) and the work which one actually did, which Agenda for Change aimed to fix. Most NHS staff are now on the AfC system which took quite a long time to implement across the UK. A small percentage of staff went through an appeal procedure as they disagreed with the band that they have been placed on.\n\nIn 2015\u201316 the minimum starting salary for a registered nurse will be \u00a321,692 in England, Wales while in Scotland it will be \u00a321,818.<ref name=\"RCN pay rates\">{{cite web | title =Support for you: Pay and conditions: Pay rates 2015\u201316 | publisher =[[Royal College of Nursing]] | url =http://www.rcn.org.uk/support/pay_and_conditions/pay-rates-2015-16 | accessdate = 4 June 2015 }}</ref> {{As of|2015|June|4}} Northern Ireland have yet to announce their pay rates for 2015\u201316.<ref name=\"RCN pay rates\"/>\n\n=== NHS Pay Review Body (NHSPRB) ===\nThe NHS Pay Review Body is an independent body that makes recommendations to the government on the pay of nurses and NHS staff.

Starting in November 2015, further caps came in February 2016 with the final cuts introduced in April 2016. The aim of the cap was to save \u00a31bn over three years.

Mrs. Gamp, as she is usually referred to, is dissolute, sloppy and generally drunk. She became a notorious stereotype of untrained and incompetent nurses of the early Victorian era, before the reforms of campaigners like Florence Nightingale. The caricature was popular with the British public.\n\n[[Carry On (franchise)|Carry On Films]] \u2013 [[Carry On Nurse]]/ [[Carry On Matron]], The ''Carry On'' franchise primarily consists of a sequence of 31 low-budget British comedy motion pictures (1958\u201392), four Christmas specials, a television series of thirteen episodes, and three West End and provincial stage plays.

It is written by its core cast, Jo Brand, Vicki Pepperdine, and Joanna Scanlan. Several episodes were directed by Peter Capaldi.
