In eukaryotes, this is known as pre-mRNA which undergoes post-transcriptional processing to produce mature mRNA. However, in prokaryotes post-transcriptional processing is not required so only mature mRNA is produced. \n\nFirst, an enzyme known as a [[helicase]] acts on the molecule of DNA. DNA has an [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]], double helix structure composed of two, [[Complementary (molecular biology)|complementary]] [[polynucleotide]] strands, held together by [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen bonds]] between the complementary base pairs. The helicase disrupts the hydrogen bonds causing a region of DNA corresponding to a gene to unwind, separating the two DNA strands and exposing a series of bases. Despite DNA being a double stranded molecule, only one of the strands acts as a template for pre-mRNA synthesis - this strand is known as the template strand. The other DNA strand (which is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template strand) is known as the coding strand. \n\nThe enzyme [[RNA polymerase]] then binds to the exposed template strand and reads from the [[Directionality (molecular biology|3-prime]] (3') end to the [[Directionality (molecular biology|5-prime]] (5') end. Simultaneously, the RNA polymerase synthesises a single strand of pre-mRNA (in the 5'-to-3' direction) through complementary [[base pair|base pairing]] with the exposed nucleotides on the template strand.

In order to translate the mRNA molecule, the ribosome uses small molecules known as [[transfer RNA|transfer RNAs]] (tRNA) to bring the correct amino acids to the ribosome. Each tRNA is composed of 70-80 nucleotides and adopts a characteristic cloverleaf structure due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between nucleotides within the molecule. <ref name=\"Cooper 2000\">{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=GM |title=The cell : a molecular approach |date=2000 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland (MA) |isbn=9780878931064 |edition=2nd}}</ref> There are around 60 different types of tRNAs, which serve as adaptors in this process, each binds to a specific nucleotide sequence (known as a [[codon]]) in the mRNA molecule and delivering a specific amino acid. \n\nThe ribosome initially attaches to the mRNA at the [[start codon]] (AUG) and begins to translate the mRNA molecule using codon-anticodon base pairing. The mRNA nucleotide sequence is read in [[genetic code|triplets]] - three adjacent nucleotides in the mRNA molecule correspond to a single codon. Each tRNA has an exposed sequence of three nucleotides, known as the anticodon, which are complementary in sequence to the codon on the mRNA molecule. For example, the first codon encountered on the mRNA molecule is the start codon, composed of the nucleotides AUG, the correct tRNA with the anticodon (complementary 3 nucleotide sequence UAC) binds to the mRNA using the ribosome. This tRNA delivers the correct amino acid corresponding to the mRNA codon, in the case of the start codon, the correct amino acid is methionine. The next codon (adjacent to the start codon) is then bound by the correct tRNA with complementary anticodon, delivering the next amino acid to ribosome.

The next complementary tRNA with the correct anticodon complementary to the third codon is selected for, delivering the next amino acid to the ribosome which is covalently joined to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues with the ribosome moving along the mRNA molecule adding up to 15 amino acids per second to the polypeptide chain. Behind the first ribosome, up to 50 additional ribosomes can bind to the mRNA molecule and synthesise an identical polypeptide - this enables simultaneous synthesis of multiple identical polypeptide chains <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level.

The basic form of [[protein structure]] is known as the [[protein primary structure|primary structure]], which is simply the polypeptide chain i.e. a sequence of covalently bonded amino acids. The primary structure of a protein is encoded by a gene. Therefore, any changes to the sequence of the gene can alter the primary structure of the protein and all subsequent levels of protein structure ultimately changing the overall structure and function. \n\nThe primary structure of a protein (the polypeptide chain) can then fold or coil to form the [[protein secondary structure|secondary structure]] of the protein. The most common types of secondary structure are known as an [[alpha helix]] or [[beta sheet]], these are small structures produced by hydrogen bonds forming within the polypeptide chain. This secondary structure then folds to produce the [[protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]] of the protein, this is its overall 3D structure which is made of different secondary structures folding together. In the tertiary structure, key protein features e.g. the active site, are folded and formed enabling the protein to function. Finally, whilst most proteins are made of a single polypeptide chain, however, some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains (known as subunits) which fold and interact to form the [[protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]. Hence, this is a [[multi-subunit complex]] composed of multiple folded, polypeptide chain subunits <ref name=\"Khan proteins 2020\">{{cite web |title=Protein structure: Primary, secondary, tertiary & quatrenary (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/proteins-and-amino-acids/a/orders-of-protein-structure |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=11 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.  \n\n===Role of Protein Synthesis in Disease ===\nMany diseases are caused by mutations in genes, due to the direct connection between the genetic code of the gene and the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Changes to the primary structure of the protein can result in the protein mis-folding and unable to function. Mutations within a single gene have been identified as a cause of multiple diseases, including [[sickle cell disease]], known as single gene disorders.\n\n[[File:Sickle Cell Anaemia red blood cells in blood vessels.png|400px|thumb|A comparison between a healthy individual and a sufferer of sickle cell anaemia showing the different red blood cell shapes and differing flow within blood vessels]]\n\nSickle cell disease is a group of diseases caused by a mutation in a subunit of [[haemoglobin]], a protein found in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen, the most dangerous of these diseases is known as sickle cell anaemia. Sickle cell anaemia is the most common [[genetic disorder|homozygous recessive single gene disorder]], meaning the individual must carry a mutation in both copies of the gene to suffer from the disease.

When red blood cells unload oxygen into the tissues of the body, the mutated haemoglobin starts to stick together to form a semi-solid structure within the red blood cell. This distorts the shape of the red blood cell, resulting in the characteristic \"sickle\" red blood cell shape, and reduces flexibility.

In eukaryotes, this is known as pre-mRNA which undergoes post-transcriptional processing to produce mature mRNA. However, in prokaryotes post-transcriptional processing is not required so only mature mRNA is produced. \n\nFirst, an enzyme known as a [[helicase]] acts on the molecule of DNA. DNA has an [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]], double helix structure composed of two, [[Complementary (molecular biology)|complementary]] [[polynucleotide]] strands, held together by [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen bonds]] between the complementary base pairs. The helicase disrupts the hydrogen bonds causing a region of DNA corresponding to a gene to unwind, separating the two DNA strands and exposing a series of bases. Despite DNA being a double stranded molecule, only one of the strands acts as a template for pre-mRNA synthesis - this strand is known as the template strand. The other DNA strand (which is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template strand) is known as the coding strand. \n\nThe enzyme [[RNA polymerase]] then binds to the exposed template strand and reads from the [[Directionality (molecular biology|3-prime]] (3') end to the [[Directionality (molecular biology|5-prime]] (5') end. Simultaneously, the RNA polymerase synthesises a single strand of pre-mRNA (in the 5'-to-3' direction) through complementary [[base pair|base pairing]] with the exposed nucleotides on the template strand.

In order to translate the mRNA molecule, the ribosome uses small molecules known as [[transfer RNA|transfer RNAs]] (tRNA) to bring the correct amino acids to the ribosome. Each tRNA is composed of 70-80 nucleotides and adopts a characteristic cloverleaf structure due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between nucleotides within the molecule. <ref name=\"Cooper 2000\">{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=GM |title=The cell : a molecular approach |date=2000 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland (MA) |isbn=9780878931064 |edition=2nd}}</ref> There are around 60 different types of tRNAs, which serve as adaptors in this process, each binds to a specific nucleotide sequence (known as a [[codon]]) in the mRNA molecule and delivering a specific amino acid. \n\nThe ribosome initially attaches to the mRNA at the [[start codon]] (AUG) and begins to translate the mRNA molecule using codon-anticodon base pairing. The mRNA nucleotide sequence is read in [[genetic code|triplets]] - three adjacent nucleotides in the mRNA molecule correspond to a single codon. Each tRNA has an exposed sequence of three nucleotides, known as the anticodon, which are complementary in sequence to the codon on the mRNA molecule. For example, the first codon encountered on the mRNA molecule is the start codon, composed of the nucleotides AUG, the correct tRNA with the anticodon (complementary 3 nucleotide sequence UAC) binds to the mRNA using the ribosome. This tRNA delivers the correct amino acid corresponding to the mRNA codon, in the case of the start codon, the correct amino acid is methionine. The next codon (adjacent to the start codon) is then bound by the correct tRNA with complementary anticodon, delivering the next amino acid to ribosome.

The next complementary tRNA with the correct anticodon complementary to the third codon is selected for, delivering the next amino acid to the ribosome which is covalently joined to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues with the ribosome moving along the mRNA molecule adding up to 15 amino acids per second to the polypeptide chain.

Termination of the growing polypeptide chain occurs when the ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) in the mRNA molecule. When this happens, no tRNA can recognise it and a [[release factor]] induces the release of the polypeptide chain from the ribosome.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Protein Folding==\n[[File:Protein folding figure.png|300px|thumb|Shows the process of protein folding from primary structure through to quaternary structure]]\n\nOnce synthesis of the polypeptide chain is completed by the ribosome, the polypeptide chain released and folds to adopt a specific structure which enables the protein to carry out its functions. The basic form of [[protein structure]] is known as the [[protein primary structure|primary structure]], which is simply the polypeptide chain i.e. a sequence of covalently bonded amino acids. The primary structure of a protein is encoded by a gene. Therefore, any changes to the sequence of the gene can alter the primary structure of the protein and all subsequent levels of protein structure ultimately changing the overall structure and function. \n\nThe primary structure of a protein (the polypeptide chain) can then fold or coil to form the [[protein secondary structure|secondary structure]] of the protein. The most common types of secondary structure are known as an [[alpha helix]] or [[beta sheet]], these are small structures produced by hydrogen bonds forming within the polypeptide chain. This secondary structure then folds to produce the [[protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]] of the protein, this is its overall 3D structure which is made of different secondary structures folding together. In the tertiary structure, key protein features e.g. the active site, are folded and formed enabling the protein to function. Finally, whilst most proteins are made of a single polypeptide chain, however, some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains (known as subunits) which fold and interact to form the [[protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]. Hence, this is a [[multi-subunit complex]] composed of multiple folded, polypeptide chain subunits <ref name=\"Khan proteins 2020\">{{cite web |title=Protein structure: Primary, secondary, tertiary & quatrenary (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/proteins-and-amino-acids/a/orders-of-protein-structure |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=11 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.  \n\n===Role of Protein Synthesis in Disease ===\nMany diseases are caused by mutations in genes, due to the direct connection between the genetic code of the gene and the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Changes to the primary structure of the protein can result in the protein mis-folding and unable to function.

This distorts the shape of the red blood cell, resulting in the characteristic \"sickle\" red blood cell shape, and reduces flexibility.

Static objects and functions can be defined at the top level of the package without needing a redundant class level. For compatibility with Java, Kotlin provides a <code>JvmName</code> annotation which specifies a class name used when the package is viewed from a Java project. For example, <code>@file:JvmName(\"JavaClassName\")</code>.\n\n===Main entry point===\nAs in C, C++, Java, and Go, the [[entry point]] to a Kotlin [[Computer program|program]] is a function named \"main\", which may be passed an array containing any [[Command-line interface|command line]] arguments. (This is optional since Kotlin 1.3<ref>{{cite web |url = https://play.kotlinlang.org/byExample/01_introduction/01_Hello%20world |title = Kotlin Examples: Learn Kotlin Programming By Example}}</ref>). [[Perl]] and [[Unix shell]] style [[string interpolation]] is supported. [[Type inference]] is also supported.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n\n// Hello, World! example\nfun main() {\n    val scope = \"World\"\n    println(\"Hello, $scope!\")\n}\n\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\n    for (arg in args) {\n        println(arg)\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Extension methods===\n\nSimilar to C#, Kotlin allows a user to add methods to any class without the formalities of creating a derived class with new methods. Instead, Kotlin adds the concept of an [[extension method]] which allows a function to be \"glued\" onto the public method list of any class without being formally placed inside of the class.  In other words, an extension method is a helper method that has access to all the public interface of a class which it can use to create a new method interface to a target class and this method will appear exactly like a method of the class, appearing as part of code completion inspection of class methods. For example:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\npackage MyStringExtensions\n\nfun String.lastChar(): Char = get(length - 1)\n\n>>> println(\"Kotlin\".lastChar()) \n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nBy placing the preceding code in the top-level of a package, the String class is extended to include a {{code|lastChar}} method that was not included in the original definition of the String class.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// Overloading '+' operator using an extension method\noperator fun Point.plus(other: Point): Point {\n    return Point(x + other.x, y + other.y)\n}\n\n>>> val p1 = Point(10, 20)\n>>> val p2 = Point(30, 40)\n>>> println(p1 + p2)\nPoint(x=40, y=60)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Unpack arguments with spread operator===\n\nSimilar to Python, the spread operator asterisk (*) unpacks an array's contents as comma-separated arguments to a function:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\nfun main(args: Array<String>) { \n    val list = listOf(\"args: \", *args)\n    println(list)\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Deconstructor methods===\n{{Distinguish|Destructor (computer programming)|text=the [[Destructor (computer programming)|destructor]]  method common in object oriented languages}}\nA deconstructor's job is to decompose a class object into a tuple of elemental objects.  For example, a 2D coordinate class might be deconstructed into a tuple of integer x and integer y.\n\nFor example, the collection object contains a deconstructor method that splits each collection item into an index and an element variable:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\nfor ((index, element) in collection.withIndex()) { \n     println(\"$index: $element\")\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Nested functions===\n\nKotlin allows local functions to be declared inside of other functions or methods.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\nclass User(val id: Int, val name: String, val address: String)\n    \nfun saveUserToDb(user: User) {\n    fun validate(user: User, value: String, fieldName: String) {\n        if (value.isEmpty()) {\n            throw IllegalArgumentException(\"Can't save user ${user.id}: empty $fieldName\")\n        }\n    }\n    \n    validate(user, user.name, \"Name\") \n    validate(user, user.address, \"Address\")\n    // Save user to the database \n    ...\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Classes are final by default===\n\nIn Kotlin, to derive a new class from a base class type, the base class needs to be explicitly marked as \"open\".  This is in contrast to most object oriented languages such as Java where classes are open by default.\n\nExample of a base class that is open to deriving a new subclass from it.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// open on the class means this class will allow derived classes\nopen class MegaButton  {\n\n    // no-open on a function means that \n    //    polymorphic behavior disabled if function overridden in derived class\n    fun disable() { ... }\n\n    // open on a function means that\n    //    polymorphic behavior allowed if function is overridden in derived class\n    open fun animate() { ... }\n}\n\nclass GigaButton: MegaButton {\n\n    // Explicit use of override keyword required to override a function in derived class\n    override fun animate() { println(\"Giga Click!\") } \n}\n\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Abstract classes are open by default===\n\nAbstract classes define abstract or \"Pure Virtual\" placeholder function that will be defined in a derived class. Abstract classes are open by default.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// No need for the open keyword here, it\u2019s already open by default\nabstract class Animated {\n\n    // This virtual function is already open by default as well\n    abstract fun animate()\n  \n    open fun stopAnimating() { }\n\n    fun animateTwice() { }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Classes are public by default===\n\nKotlin provides the following keywords to restrict visibility for top-level declaration, such as classes, and for class members:\n    public, internal, protected, and private.\n\nWhen applied to a class member:\n    public (default): Visible everywhere \n    internal:         Visible in a module \n    protected:        Visible in subclasses \n    private:          Visible in a class\n\nWhen applied to a top-level declaration\n    public (default):  Visible everywhere\n    internal:          Visible in a module\n    private:           Visible in a file\n\nExample:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// Class is visible only to current module\ninternal open class TalkativeButton : Focusable {\n    // method is only visible to current class \n    private   fun yell() = println(\"Hey!\")\n\n    // method is visible to current class and derived classes\n    protected fun whisper() = println(\"Let's talk!\")\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Primary constructor vs. secondary constructors ===\n\nKotlin supports the specification of a \"primary constructor\" as part of the class definition itself, consisting of an argument list following the class name. This argument list supports an expanded syntax on Kotlin's standard function argument lists, that enables declaration of class properties in the primary constructor, including visibility, extensibility and mutability attributes. Additionally, when defining a subclass, properties in super-interfaces and super-classes can be overridden in the primary constructor.\n    \n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// Example of class using primary constructor syntax\n// (Only one constructor required for this class)\nopen class PowerUser : User (\n    protected val nickname: String, \n    final override var isSubscribed: Boolean = true) \n    {\n         ...\n    }\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nHowever, in cases where more than one constructor is needed for a class,  a more general constructor can be used called '''secondary constructor syntax''' which closely resembles the constructor syntax used in most object-oriented languages like C++, C#, and Java.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// Example of class using secondary constructor syntax\n// (more than one constructor required for this class)\nclass MyButton : View {\n\n    // Constructor #1 \n    constructor(ctx: Context) : super(ctx) { \n        // ... \n    } \n  \n    // Constructor #2\n    constructor(ctx: Context, attr: AttributeSet) : super(ctx, attr) { \n        // ... \n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Data Class ===\nKotlin provides Data Classes to define classes that store only properties. In Java programming, classes that store only properties are not unusual, but regular classes are used for this purpose. Kotlin has given provision to exclusively define classes that store properties alone. These data classes do not have any methods but only properties. A data class does not contain a body, unlike a regular class. '''data''' keyword is used before '''class''' keyword to define a data class.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\nfun main(args: Array) {\n    // create a data class object like any other class object\n    var book1 = Book(\"Kotlin Programming\", 250)\n    println(book1)\n    // output: Book(name=Kotlin Programming, price=250)\n}\n     \n// data class with parameters and their optional default values\ndata class Book(val name: String = \"\", val price: Int = 0)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Anko library===\n\nAnko was a library specifically created for Kotlin to help build [[Android (Operating System)|Android]] UI applications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/Kotlin/anko|title=Kotlin/anko|date=February 11, 2020|via=GitHub}}</ref> It was deprecated in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/Kotlin/anko|title=Kotlin/anko|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n    fun Activity.showAreYouSureAlert(process: () -> Unit) {\n        alert(\n            title   = \"Are you sure?\",\n            message = \"Are you really sure?\") \n            {\n                positiveButton(\"Yes\") { process() }\n                negativeButton(\"No\") { cancel() }\n            }\n    }\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Kotlin interactive shell===\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"bash\">\n$ kotlinc-jvm\ntype :help for help; :quit for quit\n>>> 2 + 2\n4\n>>> println(\"Hello, World!\")\nHello, World!\n>>>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Kotlin as a scripting language===\n\nKotlin can also be used as a scripting language. A script is a Kotlin source file (.kts) with top level executable code.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// list_folders.kts\nimport java.io.File\nval folders = File(args[0]).listFiles { file -> file.isDirectory() }\nfolders?.forEach { folder -> println(folder) }\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nScripts can be run by passing the <code>-script</code> option and the corresponding script file to the compiler.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"bash\">\n$ kotlinc -script list_folders.kts \"path_to_folder_to_inspect\"\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Complex \"hello world\" example===\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\n    greet {\n        to.place\n    }.print()\n}\n\n// Inline higher-order functions\ninline fun greet(s: () -> String) : String = greeting andAnother s()\n\n// Infix functions, extensions, type inference, nullable types, \n// lambda expressions, labeled this, Elvis operator (?:)\ninfix fun String.andAnother(other : Any?) = buildString() \n{ \n    append(this@andAnother); append(\" \"); append(other ?: \"\") \n}\n\n// Immutable types, delegated properties, lazy initialization, string templates\nval greeting by lazy { val doubleEl: String = \"ll\"; \"he${doubleEl}o\" }\n\n// Sealed classes, companion objects\nsealed class to { companion object { val place = \"world\"} }\n\n// Extensions, Unit\nfun String.print() = println(this)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nKotlin makes a distinction between nullable and non-nullable data types. All nullable objects must be declared with a \"?\" postfix after the type name. Operations on nullable objects need special care from developers: null-check must be performed before using the value. Kotlin provides null-safe operators to help developers:\n\n* {{mono|?.}} ([[safe navigation operator]]) can be used to safely access a method or property of a possibly null object. If the object is null, the method will not be called and the expression evaluates to null.\n* {{mono|?:}} ([[null coalescing operator]]) often referred to as the [[Elvis operator]]:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=kotlin line=\"1\">\nfun sayHello(maybe: String?, neverNull: Int) {\n    // use of elvis operator\n    val name: String = maybe ?: \"stranger\"\n    println(\"Hello $name\")\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAn example of the use of the safe navigation operator:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=kotlin line=\"1\">\n// returns null if...\n// - foo() returns null,\n// - or if foo() is non-null, but bar() returns null,\n// - or if foo() and bar() are non-null, but baz() returns null.\n// vice versa, return value is non-null if and only if foo(), bar() and baz() are non-null\nfoo()?.bar()?.baz()\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nKotlin provides support for [[higher order functions]] and [[anonymous functions]] or lambdas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Higher-Order Functions and Lambdas|url=https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/lambdas.html|website=Kotlin|publisher=Jetbrains|accessdate=19 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=kotlin line=\"1\">\n// the following function takes a lambda, f, and executes f passing it the string, \"lambda\"\n// note that (s: String) -> Unit indicates a lambda with a String parameter and Unit return type\nfun executeLambda(f: (s: String) -> Unit) {\n    f(\"lambda\")\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nLambdas are declared using braces, {{mono|{  } }}.

Static objects and functions can be defined at the top level of the package without needing a redundant class level. For compatibility with Java, Kotlin provides a <code>JvmName</code> annotation which specifies a class name used when the package is viewed from a Java project. For example, <code>@file:JvmName(\"JavaClassName\")</code>.\n\n===Main entry point===\nAs in C, C++, Java, and Go, the [[entry point]] to a Kotlin [[Computer program|program]] is a function named \"main\", which may be passed an array containing any [[Command-line interface|command line]] arguments. (This is optional since Kotlin 1.3<ref>{{cite web |url = https://play.kotlinlang.org/byExample/01_introduction/01_Hello%20world |title = Kotlin Examples: Learn Kotlin Programming By Example}}</ref>). [[Perl]] and [[Unix shell]] style [[string interpolation]] is supported. [[Type inference]] is also supported.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n\n// Hello, World! example\nfun main() {\n    val scope = \"World\"\n    println(\"Hello, $scope!\")\n}\n\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\n    for (arg in args) {\n        println(arg)\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Extension methods===\n\nSimilar to C#, Kotlin allows a user to add methods to any class without the formalities of creating a derived class with new methods. Instead, Kotlin adds the concept of an [[extension method]] which allows a function to be \"glued\" onto the public method list of any class without being formally placed inside of the class.  In other words, an extension method is a helper method that has access to all the public interface of a class which it can use to create a new method interface to a target class and this method will appear exactly like a method of the class, appearing as part of code completion inspection of class methods. For example:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\npackage MyStringExtensions\n\nfun String.lastChar(): Char = get(length - 1)\n\n>>> println(\"Kotlin\".lastChar()) \n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nBy placing the preceding code in the top-level of a package, the String class is extended to include a {{code|lastChar}} method that was not included in the original definition of the String class.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// Overloading '+' operator using an extension method\noperator fun Point.plus(other: Point): Point {\n    return Point(x + other.x, y + other.y)\n}\n\n>>> val p1 = Point(10, 20)\n>>> val p2 = Point(30, 40)\n>>> println(p1 + p2)\nPoint(x=40, y=60)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Unpack arguments with spread operator===\n\nSimilar to Python, the spread operator asterisk (*) unpacks an array's contents as comma-separated arguments to a function:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\nfun main(args: Array<String>) { \n    val list = listOf(\"args: \", *args)\n    println(list)\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Deconstructor methods===\n{{Distinguish|Destructor (computer programming)|text=the [[Destructor (computer programming)|destructor]]  method common in object oriented languages}}\nA deconstructor's job is to decompose a class object into a tuple of elemental objects.  For example, a 2D coordinate class might be deconstructed into a tuple of integer x and integer y.\n\nFor example, the collection object contains a deconstructor method that splits each collection item into an index and an element variable:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\nfor ((index, element) in collection.withIndex()) { \n     println(\"$index: $element\")\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Nested functions===\n\nKotlin allows local functions to be declared inside of other functions or methods.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\nclass User(val id: Int, val name: String, val address: String)\n    \nfun saveUserToDb(user: User) {\n    fun validate(user: User, value: String, fieldName: String) {\n        if (value.isEmpty()) {\n            throw IllegalArgumentException(\"Can't save user ${user.id}: empty $fieldName\")\n        }\n    }\n    \n    validate(user, user.name, \"Name\") \n    validate(user, user.address, \"Address\")\n    // Save user to the database \n    ...\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Classes are final by default===\n\nIn Kotlin, to derive a new class from a base class type, the base class needs to be explicitly marked as \"open\".  This is in contrast to most object oriented languages such as Java where classes are open by default.\n\nExample of a base class that is open to deriving a new subclass from it.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// open on the class means this class will allow derived classes\nopen class MegaButton  {\n\n    // no-open on a function means that \n    //    polymorphic behavior disabled if function overridden in derived class\n    fun disable() { ... }\n\n    // open on a function means that\n    //    polymorphic behavior allowed if function is overridden in derived class\n    open fun animate() { ... }\n}\n\nclass GigaButton: MegaButton {\n\n    // Explicit use of override keyword required to override a function in derived class\n    override fun animate() { println(\"Giga Click!\") } \n}\n\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Abstract classes are open by default===\n\nAbstract classes define abstract or \"Pure Virtual\" placeholder function that will be defined in a derived class. Abstract classes are open by default.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// No need for the open keyword here, it\u2019s already open by default\nabstract class Animated {\n\n    // This virtual function is already open by default as well\n    abstract fun animate()\n  \n    open fun stopAnimating() { }\n\n    fun animateTwice() { }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Classes are public by default===\n\nKotlin provides the following keywords to restrict visibility for top-level declaration, such as classes, and for class members:\n    public, internal, protected, and private.\n\nWhen applied to a class member:\n    public (default): Visible everywhere \n    internal:         Visible in a module \n    protected:        Visible in subclasses \n    private:          Visible in a class\n\nWhen applied to a top-level declaration\n    public (default):  Visible everywhere\n    internal:          Visible in a module\n    private:           Visible in a file\n\nExample:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// Class is visible only to current module\ninternal open class TalkativeButton : Focusable {\n    // method is only visible to current class \n    private   fun yell() = println(\"Hey!\")\n\n    // method is visible to current class and derived classes\n    protected fun whisper() = println(\"Let's talk!\")\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Primary constructor vs. secondary constructors ===\n\nKotlin supports the specification of a \"primary constructor\" as part of the class definition itself, consisting of an argument list following the class name. This argument list supports an expanded syntax on Kotlin's standard function argument lists, that enables declaration of class properties in the primary constructor, including visibility, extensibility and mutability attributes. Additionally, when defining a subclass, properties in super-interfaces and super-classes can be overridden in the primary constructor.\n    \n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// Example of class using primary constructor syntax\n// (Only one constructor required for this class)\nopen class PowerUser : User (\n    protected val nickname: String, \n    final override var isSubscribed: Boolean = true) \n    {\n         ...\n    }\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nHowever, in cases where more than one constructor is needed for a class,  a more general constructor can be used called '''secondary constructor syntax''' which closely resembles the constructor syntax used in most object-oriented languages like C++, C#, and Java.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// Example of class using secondary constructor syntax\n// (more than one constructor required for this class)\nclass MyButton : View {\n\n    // Constructor #1 \n    constructor(ctx: Context) : super(ctx) { \n        // ... \n    } \n  \n    // Constructor #2\n    constructor(ctx: Context, attr: AttributeSet) : super(ctx, attr) { \n        // ... \n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Data Class ===\nKotlin provides Data Classes to define classes that store only properties. In Java programming, classes that store only properties are not unusual, but regular classes are used for this purpose. Kotlin has given provision to exclusively define classes that store properties alone. These data classes do not have any methods but only properties. A data class does not contain a body, unlike a regular class. '''data''' keyword is used before '''class''' keyword to define a data class.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\nfun main(args: Array) {\n    // create a data class object like any other class object\n    var book1 = Book(\"Kotlin Programming\", 250)\n    println(book1)\n    // output: Book(name=Kotlin Programming, price=250)\n}\n     \n// data class with parameters and their optional default values\ndata class Book(val name: String = \"\", val price: Int = 0)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Anko library===\n\nAnko is a library specifically created for Kotlin to help build [[Android (Operating System)|Android]] UI applications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/Kotlin/anko|title=Kotlin/anko|date=February 11, 2020|via=GitHub}}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n    fun Activity.showAreYouSureAlert(process: () -> Unit) {\n        alert(\n            title   = \"Are you sure?\",\n            message = \"Are you really sure?\") \n            {\n                positiveButton(\"Yes\") { process() }\n                negativeButton(\"No\") { cancel() }\n            }\n    }\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Kotlin interactive shell===\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"bash\">\n$ kotlinc-jvm\ntype :help for help; :quit for quit\n>>> 2 + 2\n4\n>>> println(\"Hello, World!\")\nHello, World!\n>>>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Kotlin as a scripting language===\n\nKotlin can also be used as a scripting language. A script is a Kotlin source file (.kts) with top level executable code.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// list_folders.kts\nimport java.io.File\nval folders = File(args[0]).listFiles { file -> file.isDirectory() }\nfolders?.forEach { folder -> println(folder) }\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nScripts can be run by passing the <code>-script</code> option and the corresponding script file to the compiler.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"bash\">\n$ kotlinc -script list_folders.kts \"path_to_folder_to_inspect\"\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Complex \"hello world\" example===\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\n    greet {\n        to.place\n    }.print()\n}\n\n// Inline higher-order functions\ninline fun greet(s: () -> String) : String = greeting andAnother s()\n\n// Infix functions, extensions, type inference, nullable types, \n// lambda expressions, labeled this, Elvis operator (?:)\ninfix fun String.andAnother(other : Any?) = buildString() \n{ \n    append(this@andAnother); append(\" \"); append(other ?: \"\") \n}\n\n// Immutable types, delegated properties, lazy initialization, string templates\nval greeting by lazy { val doubleEl: String = \"ll\"; \"he${doubleEl}o\" }\n\n// Sealed classes, companion objects\nsealed class to { companion object { val place = \"world\"} }\n\n// Extensions, Unit\nfun String.print() = println(this)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nKotlin makes a distinction between nullable and non-nullable data types. All nullable objects must be declared with a \"?\" postfix after the type name. Operations on nullable objects need special care from developers: null-check must be performed before using the value. Kotlin provides null-safe operators to help developers:\n\n* {{mono|?.}} ([[safe navigation operator]]) can be used to safely access a method or property of a possibly null object. If the object is null, the method will not be called and the expression evaluates to null.\n* {{mono|?:}} ([[null coalescing operator]]) often referred to as the [[Elvis operator]]:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=kotlin line=\"1\">\nfun sayHello(maybe: String?, neverNull: Int) {\n    // use of elvis operator\n    val name: String = maybe ?: \"stranger\"\n    println(\"Hello $name\")\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAn example of the use of the safe navigation operator:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=kotlin line=\"1\">\n// returns null if...\n// - foo() returns null,\n// - or if foo() is non-null, but bar() returns null,\n// - or if foo() and bar() are non-null, but baz() returns null.\n// vice versa, return value is non-null if and only if foo(), bar() and baz() are non-null\nfoo()?.bar()?.baz()\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nKotlin provides support for [[higher order functions]] and [[anonymous functions]] or lambdas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Higher-Order Functions and Lambdas|url=https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/lambdas.html|website=Kotlin|publisher=Jetbrains|accessdate=19 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=kotlin line=\"1\">\n// the following function takes a lambda, f, and executes f passing it the string, \"lambda\"\n// note that (s: String) -> Unit indicates a lambda with a String parameter and Unit return type\nfun executeLambda(f: (s: String) -> Unit) {\n    f(\"lambda\")\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nLambdas are declared using braces, {{mono|{  } }}. If a lambda takes parameters, they are declared within the braces and followed by the {{mono|->}} operator.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"kotlin\" line=\"1\">\n// the following statement defines a lambda that takes a single parameter and passes it to the println function\nval l = { c : Any? -> println(c) }\n// lambdas with no parameters may simply be defined using { }\nval l2 = { print(\"no parameters\") }\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==Tools==\n* [[IntelliJ IDEA]] has plug-in support for Kotlin.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6954-kotlin |title = Kotlin :: JetBrains Plugin Repository |website = Plugins.jetbrains.com |date = 2017-03-31 |accessdate = 2017-04-11 }}</ref> IntelliJ IDEA 15 is the first version to bundle the Kotlin plugin in the IntelliJ Installer, and provide Kotlin support out of the box.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/whatsnew/ |title = What's New in IntelliJ IDEA 2017.1 |website = Jetbrains.com |accessdate = 2017-04-11 }}</ref>\n* JetBrains also provides a plugin for [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started-eclipse.html |title = Getting Started with Eclipse Neon \u2013 Kotlin Programming Language |website = Kotlinlang.org |date = 2016-11-10 |accessdate = 2017-04-11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-eclipse |title = JetBrains/kotlin-eclipse: Kotlin Plugin for Eclipse |publisher = GitHub |accessdate = 2017-04-11 }}</ref> \n* Integration with common Java build tools is supported including [[Apache Maven]],<ref>{{cite web |url = https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-maven.html |title = Using Maven \u2013 Kotlin Programming Language |website = kotlinlang.org |accessdate = 2017-05-09 }}</ref> [[Apache Ant]],<ref>{{cite web |url = https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-ant.html |title = Using Ant \u2013 Kotlin Programming Language |website = kotlinlang.org |accessdate = 2017-05-09 }}</ref> and [[Gradle]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-gradle.html |title = Using Gradle \u2013 Kotlin Programming Language |website = kotlinlang.org |accessdate = 2017-05-09 }}</ref>\n* [[Android Studio]]  (based on IntelliJ IDEA) has official support for Kotlin, starting from Android Studio 3.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developer.android.com/kotlin|title=Kotlin and Android|website=Android Developers}}</ref>\n* [[Emacs]] has a Kotlin Mode in its Melpa package repository.\n* [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] has a plugin maintained on Github.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/udalov/kotlin-vim|publisher=GitHub|title=udalov/kotlin-vim: Kotlin plugin for Vim.

Allegory and metaphor have often played an important role in the history of biology.]]\nThe '''history of biology''' traces the study of the [[life|living world]] from [[ancient]] to [[Modernity|modern]] times. Although the concept of ''[[biology]]'' as a single coherent field arose in the 19th century, the biological sciences emerged from [[history of medicine|traditions of medicine]] and [[natural history]] reaching back to [[ayurveda]], [[ancient Egyptian medicine]] and the works of [[Aristotle]] and [[Galen]] in the ancient [[Greco-Roman world]]. This ancient work was further developed in the Middle Ages by [[Islamic medicine|Muslim physicians]] and scholars such as [[Avicenna]]. During the European [[Renaissance]] and early modern period, biological thought was revolutionized in Europe by a renewed interest in [[empiricism]] and the discovery of many novel organisms. Prominent in this movement were [[Vesalius]] and [[William Harvey|Harvey]], who used experimentation and careful observation in physiology, and naturalists such as [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] and [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] who began to [[Scientific classification|classify the diversity of life]] and the [[fossil record]], as well as the development and behavior of organisms. [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] revealed by means of [[microscopy]] the previously unknown world of microorganisms, laying the groundwork for [[cell theory]]. The growing importance of [[natural theology]], partly a response to the rise of [[mechanical philosophy]], encouraged the growth of natural history (although it entrenched the [[teleological argument|argument from design]]).\n\nOver the 18th and 19th centuries, biological sciences such as [[botany]] and [[zoology]] became increasingly professional [[scientific discipline]]s. [[Lavoisier]] and other physical scientists began to connect the animate and inanimate worlds through physics and chemistry. Explorer-naturalists such as [[Alexander von Humboldt]] investigated the interaction between organisms and their environment, and the ways this relationship depends on geography\u2014laying the foundations for [[biogeography]], [[ecology]] and [[ethology]]. Naturalists began to reject [[essentialism]] and consider the importance of [[extinction]] and the [[history of evolutionary thought|mutability of species]]. [[Cell theory]] provided a new perspective on the fundamental basis of life. These developments, as well as the results from [[embryology]] and [[paleontology]], were synthesized in [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]]. The end of the 19th century saw the fall of [[spontaneous generation]] and the rise of the [[germ theory of disease]], though the mechanism of [[biological inheritance|inheritance]] remained a mystery.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the rediscovery of [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel's]] work led to the rapid development of [[genetics]] by [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] and his students, and by the 1930s the combination of [[population genetics]] and natural selection in the \"[[Modern synthesis (20th century)|neo-Darwinian synthesis]]\". New disciplines developed rapidly, especially after [[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]] proposed the structure of [[DNA]]. Following the establishment of the [[Central Dogma]] and the cracking of the [[genetic code]], biology was largely split between ''organismal biology''\u2014the fields that deal with whole organisms and groups of organisms\u2014and the fields related to ''[[cell biology|cellular]] and [[molecular biology]]''. By the late 20th century, new fields like [[genomics]] and [[proteomics]] were reversing this trend, with organismal biologists using molecular techniques, and molecular and cell biologists investigating the interplay between genes and the environment, as well as the genetics of natural populations of organisms.\n\n==Etymology of \"biology\"==\nThe word ''biology'' is formed by combining the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:\u03b2\u03af\u03bf\u03c2|\u03b2\u03af\u03bf\u03c2]] (bios), meaning \"life\", and so the suffix '-logy', meaning \"science of\", \"knowledge of\", \"study of\", \"about of\", based on the Greek verb [[wikt:\u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03c9|\u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd]], 'legein' \"to select\", \"to gather\" (cf. the noun [[wikt:\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2|\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2]], 'logos' \"word\"). The term ''biology'' in its modern sense appears to have been introduced independently by [[Thomas Beddoes]] (in 1799),<ref>{{cite web|title=biology, ''n''.|work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] online version|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=September 2011|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/19228?redirectedFrom=Biology#eid|accessdate=1 November 2011}} {{OEDsub}}</ref> [[Karl Friedrich Burdach]] (in 1800), [[Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus]] (''Biologie oder Philosophie der lebenden Natur'', 1802) and [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] (''Hydrog\u00e9ologie'', 1802).<ref>Junker ''Geschichte der Biologie'', p8.</ref><ref>Coleman, ''Biology in the Nineteenth Century'', pp 1\u20132.</ref> The word itself appears in the title of Volume 3 of [[Michael Christoph Hanow]]'s ''Philosophiae naturalis sive physicae dogmaticae: Geologia, biologia, phytologia generalis et dendrologia'', published in 1766.\n\nBefore ''biology'', there were several terms used for the study of animals and plants. ''[[Natural history]]'' referred to the descriptive aspects of biology, though it also included [[mineralogy]] and other non-biological fields; from the Middle Ages through the Renaissance, the unifying framework of natural history was the ''scala naturae'' or [[Great Chain of Being]]. ''[[Natural philosophy]]'' and ''[[natural theology]]'' encompassed the conceptual and metaphysical basis of plant and animal life, dealing with problems of why organisms exist and behave the way they do, though these subjects also included what is now [[geology]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[astronomy]]. Physiology and (botanical) pharmacology were the province of medicine. ''Botany'', ''zoology'', and (in the case of fossils) ''geology'' replaced ''natural history'' and ''natural philosophy'' in the 18th and 19th centuries before ''biology'' was widely adopted.<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp36\u201337</ref><ref>Coleman, ''Biology in the Nineteenth Century'', pp 1\u20133.</ref> To this day, \"botany\" and \"zoology\" are widely used, although they have been joined by other sub-disciplines of biology.\n\n==Ancient and medieval knowledge==\n\n===Early cultures===\n{{see also|History of the world|History of agriculture|History of medicine}}\nThe [[earliest humans]] must have had and passed on knowledge about [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s to increase their chances of survival. This may have included knowledge of human and animal anatomy and aspects of animal behavior (such as migration patterns). However, the first major turning point in biological knowledge came with the [[Neolithic Revolution]] about 10,000 years ago. Humans first domesticated plants for farming, then [[livestock]] animals to accompany the resulting sedentary societies.<ref>Magner, ''A History of the Life Sciences'', pp 2\u20133</ref>\n\nThe ancient cultures of [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], the [[History of India|Indian subcontinent]], and [[History of China|China]], among others, produced renowned surgeons and students of the natural sciences such as [[Susruta]] and [[Zhang Zhongjing]], reflecting independent sophisticated systems of natural philosophy. However, the roots of modern biology are usually traced back to the [[secular]] tradition of [[ancient Greek philosophy]].<ref>Magner, ''A History of the Life Sciences'', pp 3\u20139</ref>\n\n====Ancient Mesopotamia====\n{{further|Babylonian medicine}}\n[[File:Divinatory livers Louvre AO19837.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Clay models of animal livers dating between the nineteenth and eighteenth centuries BCE, found in the royal palace at [[Mari, Syria|Mari]]]]\n\nThe Mesopotamians seem to have had little interest in the natural world as such, preferring to study how the gods had ordered the universe. [[Animal physiology]] was studied for [[divination]], including especially the anatomy of the [[liver]], seen as an important organ in [[haruspicy]]. [[Animal behavior]] too was studied for divinatory purposes.

The [[Taoism|Taoist]] tradition of [[Chinese alchemy]], for example, can be considered part of the life sciences due to its emphasis on health (with the ultimate goal being the [[elixir of life]]).

In 1543, [[Andreas Vesalius]] inaugurated the modern era of Western medicine with his seminal [[human anatomy]] treatise ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'', which was based on dissection of corpses. Vesalius was the first in a series of anatomists who gradually replaced [[scholasticism]] with [[empiricism]] in physiology and medicine, relying on first-hand experience rather than authority and abstract reasoning. Via [[herbalism]], medicine was also indirectly the source of renewed empiricism in the study of plants. [[Otto Brunfels]], [[Hieronymus Bock]] and [[Leonhart Fuchs]] wrote extensively on wild plants, the beginning of a nature-based approach to the full range of plant life.<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 94\u201395, 154\u2013158</ref> [[Bestiaries]]\u2014a genre that combines both the natural and figurative knowledge of animals\u2014also became more sophisticated, especially with the work of [[William Turner (naturalist)|William Turner]], [[Pierre Belon]], [[Guillaume Rondelet]], [[Conrad Gessner]], and [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]].<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 166\u2013171</ref>\n\nArtists such as [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]], often working with naturalists, were also interested in the bodies of animals and humans, studying physiology in detail and contributing to the growth of anatomical knowledge.<ref>Magner, ''A History of the Life Sciences'', pp 80\u201383</ref> The traditions of [[alchemy]] and [[natural magic]], especially in the work of [[Paracelsus]], also laid claim to knowledge of the living world.

[[Carl Linnaeus]] published a basic [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] for the natural world in 1735 (variations of which have been in use ever since), and in the 1750s introduced [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] for all his species.<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 4</ref> While Linnaeus conceived of species as unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy, the other great naturalist of the 18th century, [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]], treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable\u2014even suggesting the possibility of [[common descent]]. Though he was opposed to evolution, Buffon is a key figure in the [[history of evolutionary thought]]; his work would influence the evolutionary theories of both [[Lamarck]] and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]].<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 7</ref>\n\nThe discovery and description of new species and the [[collecting|collection]] of specimens became a passion of scientific gentlemen and a lucrative enterprise for entrepreneurs; many naturalists traveled the globe in search of scientific knowledge and adventure.<ref>See Raby, ''Bright Paradise''</ref>\n\n[[File:1655 - Frontispiece of Museum Wormiani Historia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cabinet of curiosities|Cabinets of curiosities]], such as that of [[Ole Worm]], were centers of biological knowledge in the early modern period, bringing organisms from across the world together in one place. Before the [[Age of Exploration]], naturalists had little idea of the sheer scale of biological diversity.]]\n\nExtending the work of Vesalius into experiments on still living bodies (of both humans and animals), [[William Harvey]] and other natural philosophers investigated the roles of blood, veins and arteries. Harvey's ''[[De motu cordis]]'' in 1628 was the beginning of the end for Galenic theory, and alongside [[Santorio Santorio]]'s studies of metabolism, it served as an influential model of quantitative approaches to physiology.<ref>Magner, ''A History of the Life Sciences'', pp 103\u2013113</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, the micro-world of biology was just beginning to open up. A few lensmakers and natural philosophers had been creating crude [[microscope]]s since the late 16th century, and [[Robert Hooke]] published the seminal ''[[Micrographia]]'' based on observations with his own compound microscope in 1665. But it was not until [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]]'s dramatic improvements in lensmaking beginning in the 1670s\u2014ultimately producing up to 200-fold magnification with a single lens\u2014that scholars discovered [[spermatozoa]], [[bacteria]], [[infusoria]] and the sheer strangeness and diversity of microscopic life. Similar investigations by [[Jan Swammerdam]] led to new interest in [[entomology]] and built the basic techniques of microscopic dissection and [[staining]].<ref>Magner, ''A History of the Life Sciences'', pp 133\u2013144</ref>\n[[File:Cork Micrographia Hooke.png|thumb|right|upright|In ''[[Micrographia]]'', Robert Hooke had applied the word ''cell'' to biological structures such as this piece of [[Cork cambium|cork]], but it was not until the 19th century that scientists considered cells the universal basis of life.]]\n\nAs the microscopic world was expanding, the macroscopic world was shrinking. Botanists such as [[John Ray]] worked to incorporate the flood of newly discovered organisms shipped from across the globe into a coherent taxonomy, and a coherent theology ([[natural theology]]).<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 162\u2013166</ref> Debate over another flood, the [[Noachian flood|Noachian]], catalyzed the development of [[paleontology]]; in 1669 [[Nicholas Steno]] published an essay on how the remains of living organisms could be trapped in layers of sediment and mineralized to produce [[fossil]]s. Although Steno's ideas about fossilization were well known and much debated among natural philosophers, an organic origin for all fossils would not be accepted by all naturalists until the end of the 18th century due to philosophical and theological debate about issues such as the age of the earth and [[extinction]].<ref>Rudwick, ''The Meaning of Fossils'', pp 41\u201393</ref>\n\n==19th century: the emergence of biological disciplines==<!--section title linked from [[On the Origin of Species]], please don't change-->\nUp through the 19th century, the scope of biology was largely divided between medicine, which investigated questions of form and function (i.e., physiology), and natural history, which was concerned with the diversity of life and interactions among different forms of life and between life and non-life. By 1900, much of these domains overlapped, while natural history (and its counterpart [[natural philosophy]]) had largely given way to more specialized scientific disciplines\u2014[[cell biology|cytology]], [[bacteriology]], [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[embryology]], [[geography]], and [[geology]].\n\n[[File:Geographie der Pflanzen in den Tropen-L\u00e4ndern.jpg|thumb|left|In the course of his travels, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] mapped the distribution of plants across landscapes and recorded a variety of physical conditions such as pressure and temperature.]]\n\n===Natural history and natural philosophy===\n{{see also|Humboldtian science}}\nWidespread travel by naturalists in the early-to-mid-19th century resulted in a wealth of new information about the diversity and distribution of living organisms. Of particular importance was the work of [[Alexander von Humboldt]], which analyzed the relationship between organisms and their environment (i.e., the domain of [[natural history]]) using the quantitative approaches of [[natural philosophy]] (i.e., [[physics]] and [[chemistry]]). Humboldt's work laid the foundations of [[biogeography]] and inspired several generations of scientists.<ref>Bowler, ''The Earth Encompassed'', pp 204\u2013211</ref>\n\n====Geology and paleontology====\n{{see also|History of geology|History of paleontology}}\nThe emerging discipline of geology also brought natural history and natural philosophy closer together; the establishment of the [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic column]] linked the spatial distribution of organisms to their temporal distribution, a key precursor to concepts of evolution. [[Georges Cuvier]] and others made great strides in [[comparative anatomy]] and [[paleontology]] in the late 1790s and early 19th century. In a series of lectures and papers that made detailed comparisons between living mammals and [[fossil]] remains Cuvier was able to establish that the fossils were remains of species that had become [[extinct]]\u2014rather than being remains of species still alive elsewhere in the world, as had been widely believed.<ref>Rudwick, ''The Meaning of Fossils'', pp 112\u2013113</ref> Fossils discovered and described by [[Gideon Mantell]], [[William Buckland]], [[Mary Anning]], and [[Richard Owen]] among others helped establish that there had been an 'age of reptiles' that had preceded even the prehistoric mammals. These discoveries captured the public imagination and focused attention on the history of life on earth.<ref>Bowler, ''The Earth Encompassed'', pp 211\u2013220</ref> Most of these geologists held to [[catastrophism]], but [[Charles Lyell]]'s influential ''Principles of Geology'' (1830) popularised [[James Hutton|Hutton's]] [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], a theory that explained the geological past and present on equal terms.<ref>Bowler, ''The Earth Encompassed'', pp 237\u2013247</ref>\n\n====Evolution and biogeography====\n{{see also|History of evolutionary thought|History of speciation}}\n\nThe most significant evolutionary theory before Darwin's was that of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]; based on the [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]] (an inheritance mechanism that was widely accepted until the 20th century), it described a chain of development stretching from the lowliest microbe to humans.<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 343\u2013357</ref> The British naturalist [[Charles Darwin]], combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell, [[Thomas Malthus]]'s writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise, created a more successful evolutionary theory based on [[natural selection]]; similar evidence led [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] to independently reach the same conclusions.<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 10: \"Darwin's evidence for evolution and common descent\"; and chapter 11: \"The causation of evolution: natural selection\"; Larson, ''Evolution'', chapter 3</ref>\n\nThe 1859 publication of Darwin's theory in ''[[On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life]]'' is often considered the central event in the history of modern biology. Darwin's established credibility as a naturalist, the sober tone of the work, and most of all the sheer strength and volume of evidence presented, allowed ''Origin'' to succeed where previous evolutionary works such as the anonymous ''[[Vestiges of Creation]]'' had failed. Most scientists were convinced of evolution and [[common descent]] by the end of the 19th century. However, natural selection would not be accepted as the primary mechanism of evolution until well into the 20th century, as most contemporary theories of heredity seemed incompatible with the inheritance of random variation.<ref>Larson, ''Evolution'', chapter 5: \"Ascent of Evolutionism\"; see also: Bowler, ''The Eclipse of Darwinism''; Secord, ''Victorian Sensation''</ref>\n[[File:Darwins first tree.jpg|left|thumb|[[Charles Darwin]]'s first sketch of an evolutionary tree from his ''First Notebook on Transmutation of Species'' (1837)]]\n\nWallace, following on earlier work by [[A.P. de Candolle|de Candolle]], [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]] and Darwin, made major contributions to [[zoogeography]]. Because of his interest in the transmutation hypothesis, he paid particular attention to the geographical distribution of closely allied species during his field work first in [[South America]] and then in the [[Malay archipelago]]. While in the archipelago he identified the [[Wallace line]], which runs through the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] dividing the fauna of the archipelago between an Asian zone and a [[New Guinea]]/Australian zone. His key question, as to why the fauna of islands with such similar climates should be so different, could only be answered by considering their origin. In 1876 he wrote ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'', which was the standard reference work for over half a century, and a sequel, ''Island Life'', in 1880 that focused on island biogeography. He extended the six-zone system developed by [[Philip Sclater]] for describing the geographical distribution of birds to animals of all kinds. His method of tabulating data on animal groups in geographic zones highlighted the discontinuities; and his appreciation of evolution allowed him to propose rational explanations, which had not been done before.<ref>Larson, ''Evolution'', pp 72-73, 116\u2013117; see also: Browne, ''The Secular Ark''.</ref><ref>Bowler ''Evolution: The History of an Idea'' p. 174</ref>\n\nThe scientific study of [[heredity]] grew rapidly in the wake of Darwin's ''Origin of Species'' with the work of [[Francis Galton]] and the [[biometry|biometricians]]. The origin of [[genetics]] is usually traced to the 1866 work of the [[monk]] [[Gregor Mendel]], who would later be credited with the [[laws of inheritance]]. However, his work was not recognized as significant until 35 years afterward. In the meantime, a variety of theories of inheritance (based on [[pangenesis]], [[orthogenesis]], or other mechanisms) were debated and investigated vigorously.<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 693\u2013710</ref> [[Embryology]] and [[ecology]] also became central biological fields, especially as linked to evolution and popularized in the work of [[Ernst Haeckel]]. Most of the 19th century work on heredity, however, was not in the realm of natural history, but that of [[experimental physiology]].\n\n===Physiology===\nOver the course of the 19th century, the scope of physiology expanded greatly, from a primarily medically oriented field to a wide-ranging investigation of the physical and chemical processes of life\u2014including plants, animals, and even microorganisms in addition to man. ''Living things as machines'' became a dominant metaphor in biological (and social) thinking.<ref>Coleman, ''Biology in the Nineteenth Century'', chapter 6; on the machine metaphor, see also: Rabinbach, ''The Human Motor''</ref>\n\n[[File:Albert Edelfelt - Louis Pasteur - 1885.jpg|thumb|Innovative [[laboratory glassware]] and experimental methods developed by [[Louis Pasteur]] and other biologists contributed to the young field of [[bacteriology]] in the late 19th century.]]\n\n====Cell theory, embryology and germ theory====\nAdvances in [[microscopy]] also had a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the [[cell (biology)|cell]]. In 1838 and 1839, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann|Schwann]] began promoting the ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of [[life]], though they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells. Thanks to the work of [[Robert Remak]] and [[Rudolf Virchow]], however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what came to be known as [[cell theory]].<ref>Sapp, ''Genesis'', chapter 7; Coleman, ''Biology in the Nineteenth Century'', chapters 2</ref>\n\nCell theory led biologists to re-envision individual organisms as interdependent assemblages of individual cells. Scientists in the rising field of [[cell biology|cytology]], armed with increasingly powerful microscopes and new [[staining]] methods, soon found that even single cells were far more complex than the homogeneous fluid-filled chambers described by earlier microscopists. [[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]] had described the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] in 1831, and by the end of the 19th century cytologists identified many of the key cell components: [[chromosome]]s, [[centrosome]]s [[mitochondria]], [[chloroplast]]s, and other structures made visible through staining. Between 1874 and 1884 [[Walther Flemming]] described the discrete stages of mitosis, showing that they were not [[Artifact (observational)|artifacts]] of staining but occurred in living cells, and moreover, that chromosomes doubled in number just before the cell divided and a daughter cell was produced. Much of the research on cell reproduction came together in [[August Weismann]]'s theory of heredity: he identified the nucleus (in particular chromosomes) as the hereditary material, proposed the distinction between [[somatic cell]]s and [[germ cell]]s (arguing that chromosome number must be halved for germ cells, a precursor to the concept of [[meiosis]]), and adopted [[Hugo de Vries]]'s theory of [[pangene]]s. Weismannism was extremely influential, especially in the new field of experimental [[embryology]].<ref>Sapp, ''Genesis'', chapter 8; Coleman, ''Biology in the Nineteenth Century'', chapter 3</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1850s the [[miasma theory of disease]] was largely superseded by the [[germ theory of disease]], creating extensive interest in microorganisms and their interactions with other forms of life. By the 1880s, [[bacteriology]] was becoming a coherent discipline, especially through the work of [[Robert Koch]], who introduced methods for growing pure cultures on [[Agar plate|agar gels]] containing specific nutrients in [[Petri dish]]es. The long-held idea that living organisms could easily originate from nonliving matter ([[spontaneous generation]]) was attacked in a series of experiments carried out by [[Louis Pasteur]], while debates over [[vitalism]] vs. [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]] (a perennial issue since the time of Aristotle and the Greek atomists) continued apace.<ref>Magner, ''A History of the Life Sciences'', pp 254\u2013276</ref>\n\n====Rise of organic chemistry and experimental physiology====\nIn chemistry, one central issue was the distinction between organic and inorganic substances, especially in the context of organic transformations such as [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] and [[putrefaction]]. Since Aristotle these had been considered essentially biological (''[[vitalism|vital]]'') processes. However, [[Friedrich W\u00f6hler]], [[Justus Liebig]] and other pioneers of the rising field of [[organic chemistry]]\u2014building on the work of Lavoisier\u2014showed that the organic world could often be analyzed by physical and chemical methods. In 1828 W\u00f6hler showed that the organic substance [[urea]] could be created by chemical means that do not involve life, providing a powerful challenge to [[vitalism]]. Cell extracts (\"ferments\") that could effect chemical transformations were discovered, beginning with [[diastase]] in 1833. By the end of the 19th century the concept of [[enzymes]] was well established, though equations of [[chemical kinetics]] would not be applied to enzymatic reactions until the early 20th century.<ref>Fruton, ''Proteins, Enzymes, Genes'', chapter 4; Coleman, ''Biology in the Nineteenth Century'', chapter 6</ref>\n\nPhysiologists such as [[Claude Bernard]] explored (through vivisection and other experimental methods) the chemical and physical functions of living bodies to an unprecedented degree, laying the groundwork for [[endocrinology]] (a field that developed quickly after the discovery of the first [[hormone]], [[secretin]], in 1902), [[biomechanics]], and the study of [[nutrition]] and [[digestion]]. The importance and diversity of experimental physiology methods, within both medicine and biology, grew dramatically over the second half of the 19th century. The control and manipulation of life processes became a central concern, and experiment was placed at the center of biological education.<ref>Rothman and Rothman, ''The Pursuit of Perfection'', chapter 1; Coleman, ''Biology in the Nineteenth Century'', chapter 7</ref>\n\n==Twentieth century biological sciences==\n[[File:Embryonic development of a salamander, filmed in the 1920s.ogv|thumb|Embryonic development of a salamander, filmed in the 1920s]]\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, biological research was largely a professional endeavour. Most work was still done in the [[natural history]] mode, which emphasized morphological and phylogenetic analysis over experiment-based causal explanations. However, anti-[[vitalism|vitalist]] experimental physiologists and embryologists, especially in Europe, were increasingly influential. The tremendous success of experimental approaches to development, heredity, and metabolism in the 1900s and 1910s demonstrated the power of experimentation in biology. In the following decades, experimental work replaced natural history as the dominant mode of research.<ref>See: Coleman, ''Biology in the Nineteenth Century''; Kohler, ''Landscapes and Labscapes''; Allen, ''Life Science in the Twentieth Century''; Agar, ''Science in the Twentieth Century and Beyond''</ref>\n\n===Ecology and environmental science===\n{{see also|History of ecology}}\n\nIn the early 20th century, naturalists were faced with increasing pressure to add rigor and preferably experimentation to their methods, as the newly prominent laboratory-based biological disciplines had done. [[Ecology]] had emerged as a combination of biogeography with the [[biogeochemical cycle]] concept pioneered by chemists; field biologists developed quantitative methods such as the [[quadrat]] and adapted laboratory instruments and cameras for the field to further set their work apart from traditional natural history. Zoologists and botanists did what they could to mitigate the unpredictability of the living world, performing laboratory experiments and studying semi-controlled natural environments such as gardens; new institutions like the [[Carnegie Station for Experimental Evolution]] and the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] provided more controlled environments for studying organisms through their entire life cycles.<ref>Kohler, ''Landscapes and Labscapes'', chapters 2, 3, 4</ref>\n\nThe [[ecological succession]] concept, pioneered in the 1900s and 1910s by [[Henry Chandler Cowles]] and [[Frederic Clements]], was important in early plant ecology.<ref>Agar, ''Science in the Twentieth Century and Beyond'', p. 145</ref> [[Alfred Lotka]]'s [[predator-prey equations]], [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]]'s studies of the biogeography and biogeochemical structure of lakes and rivers ([[limnology]]) and [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton's]] studies of animal [[food chain]]s were pioneers among the succession of quantitative methods that colonized the developing ecological specialties. Ecology became an independent discipline in the 1940s and 1950s after [[Eugene P. Odum]] synthesized many of the concepts of [[ecosystem ecology]], placing relationships between groups of organisms (especially material and energy relationships) at the center of the field.<ref>Hagen, ''An Entangled Bank'', chapters 2\u20135</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, as evolutionary theorists explored the possibility of multiple [[units of selection]], ecologists turned to evolutionary approaches. In [[population ecology]], debate over [[group selection]] was brief but vigorous; by 1970, most biologists agreed that natural selection was rarely effective above the level of individual organisms. The evolution of ecosystems, however, became a lasting research focus. Ecology expanded rapidly with the rise of the environmental movement; the [[International Biological Program]] attempted to apply the methods of [[big science]] (which had been so successful in the physical sciences) to ecosystem ecology and pressing environmental issues, while smaller-scale independent efforts such as [[island biogeography]] and the [[Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest]] helped redefine the scope of an increasingly diverse discipline.<ref>Hagen, ''An Entangled Bank'', chapters 8\u20139</ref>\n\n===Classical genetics, the modern synthesis, and evolutionary theory===\n{{see also|History of genetics|History of model organisms|Modern synthesis (20th century)}}\n\n[[File:Morgan crossover 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thomas Hunt Morgan]]'s illustration of [[Chromosomal crossover|crossing over]], part of the Mendelian-chromosome theory of heredity]]\n1900 marked the so-called ''rediscovery of Mendel'': [[Hugo de Vries]], [[Carl Correns]], and [[Erich von Tschermak]] independently arrived at [[Mendel's laws]] (which were not actually present in Mendel's work).<ref>Randy Moore, \"[http://papa.indstate.edu/amcbt/volume_27/v27-2p13-24.pdf The 'Rediscovery' of Mendel's Work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401145158/http://papa.indstate.edu/amcbt/volume_27/v27-2p13-24.pdf |date=2012-04-01 }}\", ''Bioscene'', Volume 27(2) pp. 13-24, May 2001.</ref> Soon after, cytologists (cell biologists) proposed that [[chromosome]]s were the hereditary material.

[[Lamarckism]], or the theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics also had many adherents. [[Darwinism]] was seen as incompatible with the continuously variable traits studied by [[biometry|biometricians]], which seemed only partially heritable. In the 1920s and 1930s\u2014following the acceptance of the Mendelian-chromosome theory\u2014 the emergence of the discipline of [[population genetics]], with the work of [[R.A. Fisher]], [[J.B.S. Haldane]] and [[Sewall Wright]], unified the idea of evolution by [[natural selection]] with [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian genetics]], producing the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]]. The [[inheritance of acquired characters]] was rejected, while mutationism gave way as genetic theories matured.<ref>Smocovitis, ''Unifying Biology'', chapter 5; see also: Mayr and Provine (eds.), ''The Evolutionary Synthesis''</ref>\n\nIn the second half of the century the ideas of population genetics began to be applied in the new discipline of the genetics of behavior, [[sociobiology]], and, especially in humans, [[evolutionary psychology]]. In the 1960s [[W.D. Hamilton]] and others developed [[game theory]] approaches to explain [[altruism]] from an evolutionary perspective through [[kin selection]]. The possible origin of higher organisms through [[endosymbiosis]], and contrasting approaches to molecular evolution in the [[gene-centered view of evolution|gene-centered view]] (which held selection as the predominant cause of evolution) and the [[neutral theory of molecular evolution|neutral theory]] (which made [[genetic drift]] a key factor) spawned perennial debates over the proper balance of [[adaptationism]] and contingency in evolutionary theory.<ref>Gould, ''The Structure of Evolutionary Theory'', chapter 8; Larson, ''Evolution'', chapter 12</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]] proposed the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]] which holds that stasis is the most prominent feature of the fossil record, and that most evolutionary changes occur rapidly over relatively short periods of time.<ref>Larson, ''Evolution'', pp 271\u2013283</ref> In 1980 [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] and [[Walter Alvarez]] proposed the hypothesis that an [[impact event]] was responsible for the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]].<ref>Zimmer, ''Evolution'', pp 188\u2013195</ref> Also in the early 1980s, statistical analysis of the fossil record of marine organisms published by [[Jack Sepkoski]] and [[David M. Raup]] led to a better appreciation of the importance of [[mass extinction events]] to the history of life on earth.<ref>Zimmer, ''Evolution'', pp 169\u2013172</ref>\n\n===Biochemistry, microbiology, and molecular biology===\n{{see also|History of biochemistry|History of molecular biology}}\n\nBy the end of the 19th century all of the major pathways of [[drug metabolism]] had been discovered, along with the outlines of protein and fatty acid metabolism and urea synthesis.<ref>Caldwell, \"Drug metabolism and pharmacogenetics\"; Fruton, ''Proteins, Enzymes, Genes'', chapter 7</ref> In the early decades of the 20th century, the minor components of foods in human nutrition, the [[vitamins]], began to be isolated and synthesized. Improved laboratory techniques such as [[chromatography]] and [[electrophoresis]] led to rapid advances in physiological chemistry, which\u2014as ''biochemistry''\u2014began to achieve independence from its medical origins. In the 1920s and 1930s, biochemists\u2014led by [[Hans Adolf Krebs|Hans Krebs]] and [[Carl Ferdinand Cori|Carl]] and [[Gerty Cori]]\u2014began to work out many of the central [[metabolic pathways]] of life: the [[citric acid cycle]], [[glycogenesis]] and [[glycolysis]], and the synthesis of [[steroid]]s and [[porphyrin]]s. Between the 1930s and 1950s, [[Fritz Lipmann]] and others established the role of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] as the universal carrier of energy in the cell, and [[mitochondria]] as the powerhouse of the cell. Such traditionally biochemical work continued to be very actively pursued throughout the 20th century and into the 21st.<ref>Fruton, ''Proteins, Enzymes, Genes'', chapters 6 and 7</ref>\n\n====Origins of molecular biology====\nFollowing the rise of classical genetics, many biologists\u2014including a new wave of physical scientists in biology\u2014pursued the question of the gene and its physical nature. [[Warren Weaver]]\u2014head of the science division of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]\u2014issued grants to promote research that applied the methods of physics and chemistry to basic biological problems, coining the term ''[[molecular biology]]'' for this approach in 1938; many of the significant biological breakthroughs of the 1930s and 1940s were funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.<ref>Morange, ''A History of Molecular Biology'', chapter 8; Kay, ''The Molecular Vision of Life'', Introduction, Interlude I, and Interlude II</ref>\n\n[[File:TMV virus under magnification.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wendell Meredith Stanley|Wendell Stanley]]'s crystallization of [[tobacco mosaic virus]] as a pure [[nucleoprotein]] in 1935 convinced many scientists that heredity might be explained purely through physics and chemistry.]]\n\nLike biochemistry, the overlapping disciplines of [[bacteriology]] and [[virology]] (later combined as ''microbiology''), situated between science and medicine, developed rapidly in the early 20th century. [[F\u00e9lix d'Herelle]]'s isolation of [[bacteriophage]] during World War I initiated a long line of research focused on phage viruses and the bacteria they infect.<ref>See: Summers, ''F\u00e9lix d'Herelle and the Origins of Molecular Biology''</ref>\n\nThe development of standard, genetically uniform organisms that could produce repeatable experimental results was essential for the development of [[molecular genetics]]. After early work with ''Drosophila'' and [[maize]], the adoption of simpler [[Scientific modelling|model system]]s like the bread mold ''[[Neurospora crassa]]'' made it possible to connect genetics to biochemistry, most importantly with [[George Wells Beadle|Beadle]] and [[Edward Lawrie Tatum|Tatum]]'s [[one gene-one enzyme hypothesis]] in 1941. Genetics experiments on even simpler systems like [[tobacco mosaic virus]] and [[bacteriophage]], aided by the new technologies of [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]] and [[ultracentrifuge|ultracentrifugation]], forced scientists to re-evaluate the literal meaning of ''life''; virus heredity and reproducing [[nucleoprotein]] cell structures outside the nucleus (\"plasmagenes\") complicated the accepted Mendelian-chromosome theory.<ref>Creager, ''The Life of a Virus'', chapters 3 and 6; Morange, ''A History of Molecular Biology'', chapter 2</ref>\n\n[[File:Crick's 1958 central dogma.svg|thumb|The \"[[central dogma of molecular biology]]\" (originally a \"dogma\" only in jest) was proposed by Francis Crick in 1958.<ref>{{Cite journal| first1 = F. | title = Central Dogma of Molecular Biology | journal = Nature | volume = 227| last1 = Crick| issue = 5258 | pages = 561\u2013563 | year = 1970| pmid = 4913914 | doi = 10.1038/227561a0|bibcode = 1970Natur.227..561C }}</ref> This is Crick's reconstruction of how he conceived of the central dogma at the time.

In 1953 [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]], building on the work of [[Maurice Wilkins]] and [[Rosalind Franklin]], suggested that the structure of DNA was a double helix. In their famous paper \"[[Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids]]\", Watson and Crick noted coyly, \"It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.\"<ref>Watson, James D. and Francis Crick. \"[http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watsoncrick.pdf Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid]\", ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', vol. 171, no. 4356, pp 737\u2013738</ref> After the 1958 [[Meselson\u2013Stahl experiment]] confirmed the [[semiconservative replication]] of DNA, it was clear to most biologists that nucleic acid sequence must somehow determine [[Peptide sequence|amino acid sequence]] in proteins; physicist [[George Gamow]] proposed that a fixed [[genetic code]] connected proteins and DNA. Between 1953 and 1961, there were few known biological sequences\u2014either DNA or protein\u2014but an abundance of proposed code systems, a situation made even more complicated by expanding knowledge of the intermediate role of [[RNA]]. To actually decipher the code, it took an extensive series of experiments in biochemistry and bacterial genetics, between 1961 and 1966\u2014most importantly the work of [[Marshall Warren Nirenberg|Nirenberg]] and [[Har Gobind Khorana|Khorana]].<ref>Morange, ''A History of Molecular Biology'', chapters 3, 4, 11, and 12; Fruton, ''Proteins, Enzymes, Genes'', chapter 8; on the Meselson-Stahl experiment, see: Holmes, ''Meselson, Stahl, and the Replication of DNA''</ref>\n\n====Expansion of molecular biology====\nIn addition to the Division of Biology at [[Caltech]], the [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]] (and its precursors) at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], and a handful of other institutions, the [[Pasteur Institute]] became a major center for molecular biology research in the late 1950s.<ref>On Caltech molecular biology, see Kay, ''The Molecular Vision of Life'', chapters 4\u20138; on the Cambridge lab, see de Chadarevian, ''Designs for Life''; on comparisons with the Pasteur Institute, see Creager, \"Building Biology across the Atlantic\"</ref> Scientists at Cambridge, led by [[Max Perutz]] and [[John Kendrew]], focused on the rapidly developing field of [[structural biology]], combining [[X-ray crystallography]] with [[Molecular modelling]] and the new computational possibilities of [[History of computing hardware|digital computing]] (benefiting both directly and indirectly from the [[military funding of science]]). A number of biochemists led by [[Frederick Sanger]] later joined the Cambridge lab, bringing together the study of [[macromolecule|macromolecular]] structure and function.<ref>de Chadarevian, ''Designs for Life'', chapters 4 and 7</ref> At the Pasteur Institute, [[Fran\u00e7ois Jacob]] and [[Jacques Monod]] followed the 1959 [[Arthur Pardee#The PaJaMo experiment|PaJaMo experiment]] with a series of publications regarding the [[lac operon|''lac'']] [[operon]] that established the concept of [[gene regulation]] and identified what came to be known as [[messenger RNA]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pardee A |title=PaJaMas in Paris |journal=Trends Genet. |volume=18 |issue=11 |pages=585\u20137 |year=2002 |pmid=12414189 |doi=10.1016/S0168-9525(02)02780-4}}</ref> By the mid-1960s, the intellectual core of molecular biology\u2014a model for the molecular basis of metabolism and reproduction\u2014 was largely complete.<ref>Morange, ''A History of Molecular Biology'', chapter 14</ref>\n\nThe late 1950s to the early 1970s was a period of intense research and institutional expansion for molecular biology, which had only recently become a somewhat coherent discipline. In what organismic biologist [[E. O. Wilson]] called \"The Molecular Wars\", the methods and practitioners of molecular biology spread rapidly, often coming to dominate departments and even entire disciplines.<ref>Wilson, ''Naturalist'', chapter 12; Morange, ''A History of Molecular Biology, chapter 15</ref> Molecularization was particularly important in [[genetics]], [[immunology]], [[embryology]], and [[neurobiology]], while the idea that life is controlled by a \"[[genetic program]]\"\u2014a metaphor Jacob and Monod introduced from the emerging fields of [[cybernetics]] and [[computer science]]\u2014became an influential perspective throughout biology.<ref>Morange, ''A History of Molecular Biology'', chapter 15; Keller, ''The Century of the Gene'', chapter 5</ref> Immunology in particular became linked with molecular biology, with innovation flowing both ways: the [[clonal selection theory]] developed by [[Niels Jerne]] and [[Frank Macfarlane Burnet]] in the mid-1950s helped shed light on the general mechanisms of protein synthesis.<ref>Morange, ''A History of Molecular Biology, pp 126\u2013132, 213\u2013214</ref>\n\nResistance to the growing influence of molecular biology was especially evident in [[evolutionary biology]]. [[Protein sequencing]] had great potential for the quantitative study of evolution (through the [[molecular clock hypothesis]]), but leading evolutionary biologists questioned the relevance of molecular biology for answering the big questions of evolutionary causation. Departments and disciplines fractured as organismic biologists asserted their importance and independence: [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] made the famous statement that \"[[nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution]]\" as a response to the molecular challenge. The issue became even more critical after 1968; [[Motoo Kimura]]'s [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]] suggested that [[natural selection]] was not the ubiquitous cause of evolution, at least at the molecular level, and that molecular evolution might be a fundamentally different process from [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] evolution. (Resolving this \"molecular/morphological paradox\" has been a central focus of molecular evolution research since the 1960s.)<ref>Dietrich, \"Paradox and Persuasion\", pp 100\u2013111</ref>\n\n===Biotechnology, genetic engineering, and genomics===\n{{see also|History of biotechnology}}\n\n[[Biotechnology]] in the general sense has been an important part of biology since the late 19th century. With the industrialization of [[brewing]] and [[agriculture]], chemists and biologists became aware of the great potential of human-controlled biological processes. In particular, [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] proved a great boon to chemical industries. By the early 1970s, a wide range of biotechnologies were being developed, from drugs like [[penicillin]] and [[steroids]] to foods like ''[[Chlorella]]'' and single-cell protein to [[gasohol]]\u2014as well as a wide range of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] [[high-yield crop]]s and agricultural technologies, the basis for the [[Green Revolution]].<ref>Bud, ''The Uses of Life'', chapters 2 and 6</ref>\n\n[[File:E coli at 10000x, original.jpg|thumb|left|Carefully engineered [[Strain (biology)|strains]] of the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' are crucial tools in biotechnology as well as many other biological fields.]]\n\n====Recombinant DNA====\nBiotechnology in the modern sense of [[genetic engineering]] began in the 1970s, with the invention of [[recombinant DNA]] techniques.<ref>Agar, ''Science in the Twentieth Century and Beyond'', p. 436</ref> [[Restriction enzyme]]s were discovered and characterized in the late 1960s, following on the heels of the isolation, then duplication, then synthesis of viral [[genes]]. Beginning with the lab of [[Paul Berg]] in 1972 (aided by ''[[EcoRI]]'' from [[Herbert Boyer]]'s lab, building on work with [[ligase]] by [[Arthur Kornberg]]'s lab), molecular biologists put these pieces together to produce the first [[transgenic organisms]]. Soon after, others began using [[plasmid]] [[Vector (molecular biology)|vectors]] and adding genes for [[antibiotic resistance]], greatly increasing the reach of the recombinant techniques.<ref>Morange, ''A History of Molecular Biology'', chapters 15 and 16</ref>\n\nWary of the potential dangers (particularly the possibility of a prolific bacteria with a viral cancer-causing gene), the scientific community as well as a wide range of scientific outsiders reacted to these developments with both enthusiasm and fearful restraint. Prominent molecular biologists led by Berg suggested a temporary moratorium on recombinant DNA research until the dangers could be assessed and policies could be created. This moratorium was largely respected, until the participants in the 1975 [[Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA]] created policy recommendations and concluded that the technology could be used safely.<ref>Bud, ''The Uses of Life'', chapter 8; Gottweis, ''Governing Molecules'', chapter 3; Morange, ''A History of Molecular Biology'', chapter 16</ref>\n\nFollowing Asilomar, new genetic engineering techniques and applications developed rapidly. [[DNA sequencing]] methods improved greatly (pioneered by [[Frederick Sanger]] and [[Walter Gilbert]]), as did [[oligonucleotide]] synthesis and [[transfection]] techniques.<ref>Morange, ''A History of Molecular Biology'', chapter 16</ref> Researchers learned to control the expression of [[transgene]]s, and were soon racing\u2014in both academic and industrial contexts\u2014to create organisms capable of expressing human genes for the production of human hormones. However, this was a more daunting task than molecular biologists had expected; developments between 1977 and 1980 showed that, due to the phenomena of split genes and [[splicing (genetics)|splicing]], higher organisms had a much more complex system of [[gene expression]] than the bacteria models of earlier studies.<ref>Morange, ''A History of Molecular Biology'', chapter 17</ref> The first such race, for synthesizing human [[insulin]], was won by [[Genentech]]. This marked the beginning of the biotech boom (and with it, the era of [[gene patent]]s), with an unprecedented level of overlap between biology, industry, and law.<ref>Krimsky, ''Biotechnics and Society'', chapter 2; on the race for insulin, see: Hall, ''Invisible Frontiers''; see also: Thackray (ed.), ''Private Science''</ref>\n\n====Molecular systematics and genomics====\n{{see also|History of molecular evolution}}\n[[File:Cycler.jpg|thumb|upright|Inside of a 48-well [[thermal cycler]], a device used to perform [[polymerase chain reaction]] on many samples at once]]\n\nBy the 1980s, protein sequencing had already transformed methods of [[scientific classification]] of organisms (especially [[cladistics]]) but biologists soon began to use RNA and DNA sequences as [[Trait (biology)|characters]]; this expanded the significance of [[molecular evolution]] within evolutionary biology, as the results of [[molecular systematics]] could be compared with traditional evolutionary trees based on [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]. Following the pioneering ideas of [[Lynn Margulis]] on [[endosymbiotic theory]], which holds that some of the [[organelles]] of [[eukaryotic]] cells originated from free living [[prokaryotic]] organisms through [[symbiotic]] relationships, even the overall division of the tree of life was revised. Into the 1990s, the five domains (Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists, and Monerans) became three (the [[Archaea]], the [[Bacteria]], and the [[Eukarya]]) based on [[Carl Woese]]'s pioneering [[molecular systematics]] work with [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]] sequencing.<ref>Sapp, ''Genesis'', chapters 18 and 19</ref>\n\nThe development and popularization of the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) in mid-1980s (by [[Kary Mullis]] and others at [[Cetus Corp.]]) marked another watershed in the history of modern biotechnology, greatly increasing the ease and speed of genetic analysis.<ref>Agar, ''Science in the Twentieth Century and Beyond'', p. 456</ref> Coupled with the use of [[expressed sequence tags]], PCR led to the discovery of many more genes than could be found through traditional biochemical or genetic methods and opened the possibility of sequencing entire genomes.<ref>Morange, ''A History of Molecular Biology'', chapter 20; see also: Rabinow, ''Making PCR''</ref>\n\nThe unity of much of the [[morphogenesis]] of organisms from fertilized egg to adult began to be unraveled after the discovery of the [[homeobox]] genes, first in fruit flies, then in other insects and animals, including humans. These developments led to advances in the field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] towards understanding how the various [[body plan]]s of the animal phyla have evolved and how they are related to one another.<ref>Gould, ''The Structure of Evolutionary Theory'', chapter 10</ref>\n\nThe [[Human Genome Project]]\u2014the largest, most costly single biological study ever undertaken\u2014began in 1988 under the leadership of [[James D. Watson]], after preliminary work with genetically simpler model organisms such as ''[[E. coli]]'', ''[[S. cerevisiae]]'' and ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]''. [[Shotgun sequencing]] and gene discovery methods pioneered by [[Craig Venter]]\u2014and fueled by the financial promise of gene patents with [[Celera Genomics]]\u2014 led to a public\u2013private sequencing competition that ended in compromise with the first draft of the human DNA sequence announced in 2000.<ref>Davies, ''Cracking the Genome'', Introduction; see also: Sulston, ''The Common Thread''</ref>\n\n==Twenty-first century biological sciences==\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, biological sciences converged with previously differentiated new and classic disciplines like [[Physics]] into research fields like [[Biophysics]].  Advances were made in [[analytical chemistry]] and physics instrumentation including improved sensors, optics, tracers, instrumentation, signal processing, networks, robots, satellites, and compute power for data collection, storage, analysis, modeling, visualization, and simulations.  These technology advances allowed theoretical and experimental research including internet publication of molecular biochemistry, [[biological system]]s, and ecosystems science.  This enabled worldwide access to better measurements, theoretical models, complex simulations, theory predictive model experimentation, analysis, worldwide internet observational [[data reporting]], open peer-review, collaboration, and internet publication.

Allegory and metaphor have often played an important role in the history of biology.]]\nThe '''history of biology''' traces the study of the [[life|living world]] from [[ancient]] to [[Modernity|modern]] times. Although the concept of ''[[biology]]'' as a single coherent field arose in the 19th century, the biological sciences emerged from [[history of medicine|traditions of medicine]] and [[natural history]] reaching back to [[ayurveda]], [[ancient Egyptian medicine]] and the works of [[Aristotle]] and [[Galen]] in the ancient [[Greco-Roman world]]. This ancient work was further developed in the Middle Ages by [[Islamic medicine|Muslim physicians]] and scholars such as [[Avicenna]]. During the European [[Renaissance]] and early modern period, biological thought was revolutionized in Europe by a renewed interest in [[empiricism]] and the discovery of many novel organisms. Prominent in this movement were [[Vesalius]] and [[William Harvey|Harvey]], who used experimentation and careful observation in physiology, and naturalists such as [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] and [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] who began to [[Scientific classification|classify the diversity of life]] and the [[fossil record]], as well as the development and behavior of organisms. [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] revealed by means of [[microscopy]] the previously unknown world of microorganisms, laying the groundwork for [[cell theory]]. The growing importance of [[natural theology]], partly a response to the rise of [[mechanical philosophy]], encouraged the growth of natural history (although it entrenched the [[teleological argument|argument from design]]).\n\nOver the 18th and 19th centuries, biological sciences such as [[botany]] and [[zoology]] became increasingly professional [[scientific discipline]]s. [[Lavoisier]] and other physical scientists began to connect the animate and inanimate worlds through physics and chemistry. Explorer-naturalists such as [[Alexander von Humboldt]] investigated the interaction between organisms and their environment, and the ways this relationship depends on geography\u2014laying the foundations for [[biogeography]], [[ecology]] and [[ethology]]. Naturalists began to reject [[essentialism]] and consider the importance of [[extinction]] and the [[history of evolutionary thought|mutability of species]]. [[Cell theory]] provided a new perspective on the fundamental basis of life. These developments, as well as the results from [[embryology]] and [[paleontology]], were synthesized in [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]]. The end of the 19th century saw the fall of [[spontaneous generation]] and the rise of the [[germ theory of disease]], though the mechanism of [[biological inheritance|inheritance]] remained a mystery.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the rediscovery of [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel's]] work led to the rapid development of [[genetics]] by [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] and his students, and by the 1930s the combination of [[population genetics]] and natural selection in the \"[[Modern synthesis (20th century)|neo-Darwinian synthesis]]\". New disciplines developed rapidly, especially after [[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]] proposed the structure of [[DNA]]. Following the establishment of the [[Central Dogma]] and the cracking of the [[genetic code]], biology was largely split between ''organismal biology''\u2014the fields that deal with whole organisms and groups of organisms\u2014and the fields related to ''[[cell biology|cellular]] and [[molecular biology]]''. By the late 20th century, new fields like [[genomics]] and [[proteomics]] were reversing this trend, with organismal biologists using molecular techniques, and molecular and cell biologists investigating the interplay between genes and the environment, as well as the genetics of natural populations of organisms.\n\n==Etymology of \"biology\"==\nThe word ''biology'' is formed by combining the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:\u03b2\u03af\u03bf\u03c2|\u03b2\u03af\u03bf\u03c2]] (bios), meaning \"life\", and so the suffix '-logy', meaning \"science of\", \"knowledge of\", \"study of\", \"about of\", based on the Greek verb [[wikt:\u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03c9|\u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd]], 'legein' \"to select\", \"to gather\" (cf. the noun [[wikt:\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2|\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2]], 'logos' \"word\"). The term ''biology'' in its modern sense appears to have been introduced independently by [[Thomas Beddoes]] (in 1799),<ref>{{cite web|title=biology, ''n''.|work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] online version|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=September 2011|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/19228?redirectedFrom=Biology#eid|accessdate=1 November 2011}} {{OEDsub}}</ref> [[Karl Friedrich Burdach]] (in 1800), [[Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus]] (''Biologie oder Philosophie der lebenden Natur'', 1802) and [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] (''Hydrog\u00e9ologie'', 1802).<ref>Junker ''Geschichte der Biologie'', p8.</ref><ref>Coleman, ''Biology in the Nineteenth Century'', pp 1\u20132.</ref> The word itself appears in the title of Volume 3 of [[Michael Christoph Hanow]]'s ''Philosophiae naturalis sive physicae dogmaticae: Geologia, biologia, phytologia generalis et dendrologia'', published in 1766.\n\nBefore ''biology'', there were several terms used for the study of animals and plants. ''[[Natural history]]'' referred to the descriptive aspects of biology, though it also included [[mineralogy]] and other non-biological fields; from the Middle Ages through the Renaissance, the unifying framework of natural history was the ''scala naturae'' or [[Great Chain of Being]]. ''[[Natural philosophy]]'' and ''[[natural theology]]'' encompassed the conceptual and metaphysical basis of plant and animal life, dealing with problems of why organisms exist and behave the way they do, though these subjects also included what is now [[geology]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[astronomy]]. Physiology and (botanical) pharmacology were the province of medicine. ''Botany'', ''zoology'', and (in the case of fossils) ''geology'' replaced ''natural history'' and ''natural philosophy'' in the 18th and 19th centuries before ''biology'' was widely adopted.<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp36\u201337</ref><ref>Coleman, ''Biology in the Nineteenth Century'', pp 1\u20133.</ref> To this day, \"botany\" and \"zoology\" are widely used, although they have been joined by other sub-disciplines of biology.\n\n==Ancient and medieval knowledge==\n\n===Early cultures===\n{{see also|History of the world|History of agriculture|History of medicine}}\nThe [[earliest humans]] must have had and passed on knowledge about [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s to increase their chances of survival. This may have included knowledge of human and animal anatomy and aspects of animal behavior (such as migration patterns). However, the first major turning point in biological knowledge came with the [[Neolithic Revolution]] about 10,000 years ago. Humans first domesticated plants for farming, then [[livestock]] animals to accompany the resulting sedentary societies.<ref>Magner, ''A History of the Life Sciences'', pp 2\u20133</ref>\n\nThe ancient cultures of [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], the [[History of India|Indian subcontinent]], and [[History of China|China]], among others, produced renowned surgeons and students of the natural sciences such as [[Susruta]] and [[Zhang Zhongjing]], reflecting independent sophisticated systems of natural philosophy. However, the roots of modern biology are usually traced back to the [[secular]] tradition of [[ancient Greek philosophy]].<ref>Magner, ''A History of the Life Sciences'', pp 3\u20139</ref>\n\n====Ancient Mesopotamia====\n{{further|Babylonian medicine}}\n[[File:Divinatory livers Louvre AO19837.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Clay models of animal livers dating between the nineteenth and eighteenth centuries BCE, found in the royal palace at [[Mari, Syria|Mari]]]]\n\nThe Mesopotamians seem to have had little interest in the natural world as such, preferring to study how the gods had ordered the universe. [[Animal physiology]] was studied for [[divination]], including especially the anatomy of the [[liver]], seen as an important organ in [[haruspicy]]. [[Animal behavior]] too was studied for divinatory purposes.

The [[Taoism|Taoist]] tradition of [[Chinese alchemy]], for example, can be considered part of the life sciences due to its emphasis on health (with the ultimate goal being the [[elixir of life]]).

Ayurvedic writers also classified living things into four categories based on the method of birth (from the womb, eggs, heat & moisture, and seeds) and explained the conception of a [[fetus]] in detail. They also made considerable advances in the field of [[surgery]], often without the use of human [[dissection]] or animal [[vivisection]].<ref>Magner, ''A History of the Life Sciences'', p. 6</ref> One of the earliest Ayurvedic treatises was the ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]'', attributed to Sushruta in the 6th century BCE.

Though his early work in natural philosophy was speculative, [[Aristotle's biology|Aristotle's later biological writings]] were more empirical, focusing on biological causation and the diversity of life. He made countless observations of nature, especially the habits and [[Abstraction|attributes]] of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s in the world around him, which he devoted considerable attention to [[categorization|categorizing]]. In all, Aristotle classified 540 animal species, and dissected at least 50. He believed that intellectual purposes, [[formal cause]]s, guided all natural processes.<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 84\u201390, 135; Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'', p 41\u201344</ref>\n\nAristotle, and nearly all Western scholars after him until the 18th century, believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to humans: the ''scala naturae'' or [[Great Chain of Being]].<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 201\u2013202; see also: Lovejoy, ''The Great Chain of Being''</ref> Aristotle's successor at the [[Lyceum]], [[Theophrastus]], wrote a series of books on botany\u2014the ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|History of Plants]]''\u2014which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany, even into the [[Middle Ages]]. Many of Theophrastus' names survive into modern times, such as ''carpos'' for fruit, and ''pericarpion'' for seed vessel. [[Dioscorides]] wrote a pioneering and [[encyclopaedia|encyclopaedic]] [[pharmacopoeia]], ''[[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|De Materia Medica]]'', incorporating descriptions of some 600 plants and their uses in [[Roman medicine|medicine]]. [[Pliny the Elder]], in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', assembled a similarly encyclopaedic account of things in nature, including accounts of many plants and animals.<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 90\u201391; Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'', p 46</ref>\n\nA few scholars in the [[Hellenistic period]] under the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]]\u2014particularly [[Herophilos|Herophilus of Chalcedon]] and [[Erasistratus|Erasistratus of Chios]]\u2014amended Aristotle's physiological work, even performing dissections and vivisections.<ref>Barnes, ''Hellenistic Philosophy and Science'', p 383\u2013384</ref> [[Galen|Claudius Galen]] became the most important authority on medicine and anatomy. Though a few ancient [[atomism|atomists]] such as [[Lucretius]] challenged the [[teleology|teleological]] Aristotelian viewpoint that all aspects of life are the result of design or purpose, teleology (and after the rise of [[Christianity]], [[natural theology]]) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries.

In 1543, [[Andreas Vesalius]] inaugurated the modern era of Western medicine with his seminal [[human anatomy]] treatise ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'', which was based on dissection of corpses. Vesalius was the first in a series of anatomists who gradually replaced [[scholasticism]] with [[empiricism]] in physiology and medicine, relying on first-hand experience rather than authority and abstract reasoning.

[[Carl Linnaeus]] published a basic [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] for the natural world in 1735 (variations of which have been in use ever since), and in the 1750s introduced [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] for all his species.<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 4</ref> While Linnaeus conceived of species as unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy, the other great naturalist of the 18th century, [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]], treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable\u2014even suggesting the possibility of [[common descent]]. Though he was opposed to evolution, Buffon is a key figure in the [[history of evolutionary thought]]; his work would influence the evolutionary theories of both [[Lamarck]] and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]].<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 7</ref>\n\nThe discovery and description of new species and the [[collecting|collection]] of specimens became a passion of scientific gentlemen and a lucrative enterprise for entrepreneurs; many naturalists traveled the globe in search of scientific knowledge and adventure.<ref>See Raby, ''Bright Paradise''</ref>\n\n[[File:1655 - Frontispiece of Museum Wormiani Historia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cabinet of curiosities|Cabinets of curiosities]], such as that of [[Ole Worm]], were centers of biological knowledge in the early modern period, bringing organisms from across the world together in one place. Before the [[Age of Exploration]], naturalists had little idea of the sheer scale of biological diversity.]]\n\nExtending the work of Vesalius into experiments on still living bodies (of both humans and animals), [[William Harvey]] and other natural philosophers investigated the roles of blood, veins and arteries. Harvey's ''[[De motu cordis]]'' in 1628 was the beginning of the end for Galenic theory, and alongside [[Santorio Santorio]]'s studies of metabolism, it served as an influential model of quantitative approaches to physiology.<ref>Magner, ''A History of the Life Sciences'', pp 103\u2013113</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, the micro-world of biology was just beginning to open up. A few lensmakers and natural philosophers had been creating crude [[microscope]]s since the late 16th century, and [[Robert Hooke]] published the seminal ''[[Micrographia]]'' based on observations with his own compound microscope in 1665. But it was not until [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]]'s dramatic improvements in lensmaking beginning in the 1670s\u2014ultimately producing up to 200-fold magnification with a single lens\u2014that scholars discovered [[spermatozoa]], [[bacteria]], [[infusoria]] and the sheer strangeness and diversity of microscopic life. Similar investigations by [[Jan Swammerdam]] led to new interest in [[entomology]] and built the basic techniques of microscopic dissection and [[staining]].<ref>Magner, ''A History of the Life Sciences'', pp 133\u2013144</ref>\n[[File:Cork Micrographia Hooke.png|thumb|right|upright|In ''[[Micrographia]]'', Robert Hooke had applied the word ''cell'' to biological structures such as this piece of [[Cork cambium|cork]], but it was not until the 19th century that scientists considered cells the universal basis of life.]]\n\nAs the microscopic world was expanding, the macroscopic world was shrinking. Botanists such as [[John Ray]] worked to incorporate the flood of newly discovered organisms shipped from across the globe into a coherent taxonomy, and a coherent theology ([[natural theology]]).<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 162\u2013166</ref> Debate over another flood, the [[Noachian flood|Noachian]], catalyzed the development of [[paleontology]]; in 1669 [[Nicholas Steno]] published an essay on how the remains of living organisms could be trapped in layers of sediment and mineralized to produce [[fossil]]s. Although Steno's ideas about fossilization were well known and much debated among natural philosophers, an organic origin for all fossils would not be accepted by all naturalists until the end of the 18th century due to philosophical and theological debate about issues such as the age of the earth and [[extinction]].<ref>Rudwick, ''The Meaning of Fossils'', pp 41\u201393</ref>\n\n==19th century: the emergence of biological disciplines==<!--section title linked from [[On the Origin of Species]], please don't change-->\nUp through the 19th century, the scope of biology was largely divided between medicine, which investigated questions of form and function (i.e., physiology), and natural history, which was concerned with the diversity of life and interactions among different forms of life and between life and non-life. By 1900, much of these domains overlapped, while natural history (and its counterpart [[natural philosophy]]) had largely given way to more specialized scientific disciplines\u2014[[cell biology|cytology]], [[bacteriology]], [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[embryology]], [[geography]], and [[geology]].\n\n[[File:Alexander von Humboldt - Geographie der Pflanzen in den Tropen-Laendern - stacked.jpg|thumb|left|In the course of his travels, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] mapped the distribution of plants across landscapes and recorded a variety of physical conditions such as pressure and temperature.]]\n\n===Natural history and natural philosophy===\n{{see also|Humboldtian science}}\nWidespread travel by naturalists in the early-to-mid-19th century resulted in a wealth of new information about the diversity and distribution of living organisms. Of particular importance was the work of [[Alexander von Humboldt]], which analyzed the relationship between organisms and their environment (i.e., the domain of [[natural history]]) using the quantitative approaches of [[natural philosophy]] (i.e., [[physics]] and [[chemistry]]). Humboldt's work laid the foundations of [[biogeography]] and inspired several generations of scientists.<ref>Bowler, ''The Earth Encompassed'', pp 204\u2013211</ref>\n\n====Geology and paleontology====\n{{see also|History of geology|History of paleontology}}\nThe emerging discipline of geology also brought natural history and natural philosophy closer together; the establishment of the [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic column]] linked the spatial distribution of organisms to their temporal distribution, a key precursor to concepts of evolution. [[Georges Cuvier]] and others made great strides in [[comparative anatomy]] and [[paleontology]] in the late 1790s and early 19th century. In a series of lectures and papers that made detailed comparisons between living mammals and [[fossil]] remains Cuvier was able to establish that the fossils were remains of species that had become [[extinct]]\u2014rather than being remains of species still alive elsewhere in the world, as had been widely believed.<ref>Rudwick, ''The Meaning of Fossils'', pp 112\u2013113</ref> Fossils discovered and described by [[Gideon Mantell]], [[William Buckland]], [[Mary Anning]], and [[Richard Owen]] among others helped establish that there had been an 'age of reptiles' that had preceded even the prehistoric mammals. These discoveries captured the public imagination and focused attention on the history of life on earth.<ref>Bowler, ''The Earth Encompassed'', pp 211\u2013220</ref> Most of these geologists held to [[catastrophism]], but [[Charles Lyell]]'s influential ''Principles of Geology'' (1830) popularised [[James Hutton|Hutton's]] [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], a theory that explained the geological past and present on equal terms.<ref>Bowler, ''The Earth Encompassed'', pp 237\u2013247</ref>\n\n====Evolution and biogeography====\n{{see also|History of evolutionary thought|History of speciation}}\n\nThe most significant evolutionary theory before Darwin's was that of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]; based on the [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]] (an inheritance mechanism that was widely accepted until the 20th century), it described a chain of development stretching from the lowliest microbe to humans.<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 343\u2013357</ref> The British naturalist [[Charles Darwin]], combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell, [[Thomas Malthus]]'s writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise, created a more successful evolutionary theory based on [[natural selection]]; similar evidence led [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] to independently reach the same conclusions.<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 10: \"Darwin's evidence for evolution and common descent\"; and chapter 11: \"The causation of evolution: natural selection\"; Larson, ''Evolution'', chapter 3</ref>\n\nThe 1859 publication of Darwin's theory in ''[[On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life]]'' is often considered the central event in the history of modern biology. Darwin's established credibility as a naturalist, the sober tone of the work, and most of all the sheer strength and volume of evidence presented, allowed ''Origin'' to succeed where previous evolutionary works such as the anonymous ''[[Vestiges of Creation]]'' had failed. Most scientists were convinced of evolution and [[common descent]] by the end of the 19th century. However, natural selection would not be accepted as the primary mechanism of evolution until well into the 20th century, as most contemporary theories of heredity seemed incompatible with the inheritance of random variation.<ref>Larson, ''Evolution'', chapter 5: \"Ascent of Evolutionism\"; see also: Bowler, ''The Eclipse of Darwinism''; Secord, ''Victorian Sensation''</ref>\n[[File:Darwins first tree.jpg|left|thumb|[[Charles Darwin]]'s first sketch of an evolutionary tree from his ''First Notebook on Transmutation of Species'' (1837)]]\n\nWallace, following on earlier work by [[A.P. de Candolle|de Candolle]], [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]] and Darwin, made major contributions to [[zoogeography]]. Because of his interest in the transmutation hypothesis, he paid particular attention to the geographical distribution of closely allied species during his field work first in [[South America]] and then in the [[Malay archipelago]]. While in the archipelago he identified the [[Wallace line]], which runs through the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] dividing the fauna of the archipelago between an Asian zone and a [[New Guinea]]/Australian zone. His key question, as to why the fauna of islands with such similar climates should be so different, could only be answered by considering their origin. In 1876 he wrote ''The Geographical Distribution of Animals'', which was the standard reference work for over half a century, and a sequel, ''Island Life'', in 1880 that focused on island biogeography. He extended the six-zone system developed by [[Philip Sclater]] for describing the geographical distribution of birds to animals of all kinds. His method of tabulating data on animal groups in geographic zones highlighted the discontinuities; and his appreciation of evolution allowed him to propose rational explanations, which had not been done before.<ref>Larson, ''Evolution'', pp 72-73, 116\u2013117; see also: Browne, ''The Secular Ark''.</ref><ref>Bowler ''Evolution: The History of an Idea'' p. 174</ref>\n\nThe scientific study of [[heredity]] grew rapidly in the wake of Darwin's ''Origin of Species'' with the work of [[Francis Galton]] and the [[biometry|biometricians]]. The origin of [[genetics]] is usually traced to the 1866 work of the [[monk]] [[Gregor Mendel]], who would later be credited with the [[laws of inheritance]]. However, his work was not recognized as significant until 35 years afterward. In the meantime, a variety of theories of inheritance (based on [[pangenesis]], [[orthogenesis]], or other mechanisms) were debated and investigated vigorously.<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 693\u2013710</ref> [[Embryology]] and [[ecology]] also became central biological fields, especially as linked to evolution and popularized in the work of [[Ernst Haeckel]]. Most of the 19th century work on heredity, however, was not in the realm of natural history, but that of [[experimental physiology]].\n\n===Physiology===\nOver the course of the 19th century, the scope of physiology expanded greatly, from a primarily medically oriented field to a wide-ranging investigation of the physical and chemical processes of life\u2014including plants, animals, and even microorganisms in addition to man. ''Living things as machines'' became a dominant metaphor in biological (and social) thinking.<ref>Coleman, ''Biology in the Nineteenth Century'', chapter 6; on the machine metaphor, see also: Rabinbach, ''The Human Motor''</ref>\n\n[[File:Albert Edelfelt - Louis Pasteur - 1885.jpg|thumb|Innovative [[laboratory glassware]] and experimental methods developed by [[Louis Pasteur]] and other biologists contributed to the young field of [[bacteriology]] in the late 19th century.]]\n\n====Cell theory, embryology and germ theory====\nAdvances in [[microscopy]] also had a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the [[cell (biology)|cell]]. In 1838 and 1839, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann|Schwann]] began promoting the ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of [[life]], though they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells. Thanks to the work of [[Robert Remak]] and [[Rudolf Virchow]], however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what came to be known as [[cell theory]].<ref>Sapp, ''Genesis'', chapter 7; Coleman, ''Biology in the Nineteenth Century'', chapters 2</ref>\n\nCell theory led biologists to re-envision individual organisms as interdependent assemblages of individual cells. Scientists in the rising field of [[cell biology|cytology]], armed with increasingly powerful microscopes and new [[staining]] methods, soon found that even single cells were far more complex than the homogeneous fluid-filled chambers described by earlier microscopists. [[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]] had described the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] in 1831, and by the end of the 19th century cytologists identified many of the key cell components: [[chromosome]]s, [[centrosome]]s [[mitochondria]], [[chloroplast]]s, and other structures made visible through staining. Between 1874 and 1884 [[Walther Flemming]] described the discrete stages of mitosis, showing that they were not [[Artifact (observational)|artifacts]] of staining but occurred in living cells, and moreover, that chromosomes doubled in number just before the cell divided and a daughter cell was produced. Much of the research on cell reproduction came together in [[August Weismann]]'s theory of heredity: he identified the nucleus (in particular chromosomes) as the hereditary material, proposed the distinction between [[somatic cell]]s and [[germ cell]]s (arguing that chromosome number must be halved for germ cells, a precursor to the concept of [[meiosis]]), and adopted [[Hugo de Vries]]'s theory of [[pangene]]s. Weismannism was extremely influential, especially in the new field of experimental [[embryology]].<ref>Sapp, ''Genesis'', chapter 8; Coleman, ''Biology in the Nineteenth Century'', chapter 3</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1850s the [[miasma theory of disease]] was largely superseded by the [[germ theory of disease]], creating extensive interest in microorganisms and their interactions with other forms of life. By the 1880s, [[bacteriology]] was becoming a coherent discipline, especially through the work of [[Robert Koch]], who introduced methods for growing pure cultures on [[Agar plate|agar gels]] containing specific nutrients in [[Petri dish]]es. The long-held idea that living organisms could easily originate from nonliving matter ([[spontaneous generation]]) was attacked in a series of experiments carried out by [[Louis Pasteur]], while debates over [[vitalism]] vs. [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]] (a perennial issue since the time of Aristotle and the Greek atomists) continued apace.<ref>Magner, ''A History of the Life Sciences'', pp 254\u2013276</ref>\n\n====Rise of organic chemistry and experimental physiology====\nIn chemistry, one central issue was the distinction between organic and inorganic substances, especially in the context of organic transformations such as [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] and [[putrefaction]]. Since Aristotle these had been considered essentially biological (''[[vitalism|vital]]'') processes. However, [[Friedrich W\u00f6hler]], [[Justus Liebig]] and other pioneers of the rising field of [[organic chemistry]]\u2014building on the work of Lavoisier\u2014showed that the organic world could often be analyzed by physical and chemical methods. In 1828 W\u00f6hler showed that the organic substance [[urea]] could be created by chemical means that do not involve life, providing a powerful challenge to [[vitalism]]. Cell extracts (\"ferments\") that could effect chemical transformations were discovered, beginning with [[diastase]] in 1833. By the end of the 19th century the concept of [[enzymes]] was well established, though equations of [[chemical kinetics]] would not be applied to enzymatic reactions until the early 20th century.<ref>Fruton, ''Proteins, Enzymes, Genes'', chapter 4; Coleman, ''Biology in the Nineteenth Century'', chapter 6</ref>\n\nPhysiologists such as [[Claude Bernard]] explored (through vivisection and other experimental methods) the chemical and physical functions of living bodies to an unprecedented degree, laying the groundwork for [[endocrinology]] (a field that developed quickly after the discovery of the first [[hormone]], [[secretin]], in 1902), [[biomechanics]], and the study of [[nutrition]] and [[digestion]]. The importance and diversity of experimental physiology methods, within both medicine and biology, grew dramatically over the second half of the 19th century. The control and manipulation of life processes became a central concern, and experiment was placed at the center of biological education.<ref>Rothman and Rothman, ''The Pursuit of Perfection'', chapter 1; Coleman, ''Biology in the Nineteenth Century'', chapter 7</ref>\n\n==Twentieth century biological sciences==\n[[File:Embryonic development of a salamander, filmed in the 1920s.ogv|thumb|Embryonic development of a salamander, filmed in the 1920s]]\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, biological research was largely a professional endeavour. Most work was still done in the [[natural history]] mode, which emphasized morphological and phylogenetic analysis over experiment-based causal explanations. However, anti-[[vitalism|vitalist]] experimental physiologists and embryologists, especially in Europe, were increasingly influential. The tremendous success of experimental approaches to development, heredity, and metabolism in the 1900s and 1910s demonstrated the power of experimentation in biology. In the following decades, experimental work replaced natural history as the dominant mode of research.<ref>See: Coleman, ''Biology in the Nineteenth Century''; Kohler, ''Landscapes and Labscapes''; Allen, ''Life Science in the Twentieth Century''; Agar, ''Science in the Twentieth Century and Beyond''</ref>\n\n===Ecology and environmental science===\n{{see also|History of ecology}}\n\nIn the early 20th century, naturalists were faced with increasing pressure to add rigor and preferably experimentation to their methods, as the newly prominent laboratory-based biological disciplines had done. [[Ecology]] had emerged as a combination of biogeography with the [[biogeochemical cycle]] concept pioneered by chemists; field biologists developed quantitative methods such as the [[quadrat]] and adapted laboratory instruments and cameras for the field to further set their work apart from traditional natural history. Zoologists and botanists did what they could to mitigate the unpredictability of the living world, performing laboratory experiments and studying semi-controlled natural environments such as gardens; new institutions like the [[Carnegie Station for Experimental Evolution]] and the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] provided more controlled environments for studying organisms through their entire life cycles.<ref>Kohler, ''Landscapes and Labscapes'', chapters 2, 3, 4</ref>\n\nThe [[ecological succession]] concept, pioneered in the 1900s and 1910s by [[Henry Chandler Cowles]] and [[Frederic Clements]], was important in early plant ecology.<ref>Agar, ''Science in the Twentieth Century and Beyond'', p. 145</ref> [[Alfred Lotka]]'s [[predator-prey equations]], [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]]'s studies of the biogeography and biogeochemical structure of lakes and rivers ([[limnology]]) and [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton's]] studies of animal [[food chain]]s were pioneers among the succession of quantitative methods that colonized the developing ecological specialties. Ecology became an independent discipline in the 1940s and 1950s after [[Eugene P. Odum]] synthesized many of the concepts of [[ecosystem ecology]], placing relationships between groups of organisms (especially material and energy relationships) at the center of the field.<ref>Hagen, ''An Entangled Bank'', chapters 2\u20135</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, as evolutionary theorists explored the possibility of multiple [[units of selection]], ecologists turned to evolutionary approaches. In [[population ecology]], debate over [[group selection]] was brief but vigorous; by 1970, most biologists agreed that natural selection was rarely effective above the level of individual organisms. The evolution of ecosystems, however, became a lasting research focus. Ecology expanded rapidly with the rise of the environmental movement; the [[International Biological Program]] attempted to apply the methods of [[big science]] (which had been so successful in the physical sciences) to ecosystem ecology and pressing environmental issues, while smaller-scale independent efforts such as [[island biogeography]] and the [[Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest]] helped redefine the scope of an increasingly diverse discipline.<ref>Hagen, ''An Entangled Bank'', chapters 8\u20139</ref>\n\n===Classical genetics, the modern synthesis, and evolutionary theory===\n{{see also|History of genetics|History of model organisms|Modern synthesis (20th century)}}\n\n[[File:Morgan crossover 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thomas Hunt Morgan]]'s illustration of [[Chromosomal crossover|crossing over]], part of the Mendelian-chromosome theory of heredity]]\n1900 marked the so-called ''rediscovery of Mendel'': [[Hugo de Vries]], [[Carl Correns]], and [[Erich von Tschermak]] independently arrived at [[Mendel's laws]] (which were not actually present in Mendel's work).<ref>Randy Moore, \"[http://papa.indstate.edu/amcbt/volume_27/v27-2p13-24.pdf The 'Rediscovery' of Mendel's Work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401145158/http://papa.indstate.edu/amcbt/volume_27/v27-2p13-24.pdf |date=2012-04-01 }}\", ''Bioscene'', Volume 27(2) pp. 13-24, May 2001.</ref> Soon after, cytologists (cell biologists) proposed that [[chromosome]]s were the hereditary material.

[[Lamarckism]], or the theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics also had many adherents. [[Darwinism]] was seen as incompatible with the continuously variable traits studied by [[biometry|biometricians]], which seemed only partially heritable. In the 1920s and 1930s\u2014following the acceptance of the Mendelian-chromosome theory\u2014 the emergence of the discipline of [[population genetics]], with the work of [[R.A. Fisher]], [[J.B.S. Haldane]] and [[Sewall Wright]], unified the idea of evolution by [[natural selection]] with [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian genetics]], producing the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]]. The [[inheritance of acquired characters]] was rejected, while mutationism gave way as genetic theories matured.<ref>Smocovitis, ''Unifying Biology'', chapter 5; see also: Mayr and Provine (eds.), ''The Evolutionary Synthesis''</ref>\n\nIn the second half of the century the ideas of population genetics began to be applied in the new discipline of the genetics of behavior, [[sociobiology]], and, especially in humans, [[evolutionary psychology]]. In the 1960s [[W.D. Hamilton]] and others developed [[game theory]] approaches to explain [[altruism]] from an evolutionary perspective through [[kin selection]]. The possible origin of higher organisms through [[endosymbiosis]], and contrasting approaches to molecular evolution in the [[gene-centered view of evolution|gene-centered view]] (which held selection as the predominant cause of evolution) and the [[neutral theory of molecular evolution|neutral theory]] (which made [[genetic drift]] a key factor) spawned perennial debates over the proper balance of [[adaptationism]] and contingency in evolutionary theory.<ref>Gould, ''The Structure of Evolutionary Theory'', chapter 8; Larson, ''Evolution'', chapter 12</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]] proposed the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]] which holds that stasis is the most prominent feature of the fossil record, and that most evolutionary changes occur rapidly over relatively short periods of time.<ref>Larson, ''Evolution'', pp 271\u2013283</ref> In 1980 [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] and [[Walter Alvarez]] proposed the hypothesis that an [[impact event]] was responsible for the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]].<ref>Zimmer, ''Evolution'', pp 188\u2013195</ref> Also in the early 1980s, statistical analysis of the fossil record of marine organisms published by [[Jack Sepkoski]] and [[David M.

Improved laboratory techniques such as [[chromatography]] and [[electrophoresis]] led to rapid advances in physiological chemistry, which\u2014as ''biochemistry''\u2014began to achieve independence from its medical origins. In the 1920s and 1930s, biochemists\u2014led by [[Hans Adolf Krebs|Hans Krebs]] and [[Carl Ferdinand Cori|Carl]] and [[Gerty Cori]]\u2014began to work out many of the central [[metabolic pathways]] of life: the [[citric acid cycle]], [[glycogenesis]] and [[glycolysis]], and the synthesis of [[steroid]]s and [[porphyrin]]s. Between the 1930s and 1950s, [[Fritz Lipmann]] and others established the role of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] as the universal carrier of energy in the cell, and [[mitochondria]] as the powerhouse of the cell. Such traditionally biochemical work continued to be very actively pursued throughout the 20th century and into the 21st.<ref>Fruton, ''Proteins, Enzymes, Genes'', chapters 6 and 7</ref>\n\n====Origins of molecular biology====\nFollowing the rise of classical genetics, many biologists\u2014including a new wave of physical scientists in biology\u2014pursued the question of the gene and its physical nature. [[Warren Weaver]]\u2014head of the science division of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]\u2014issued grants to promote research that applied the methods of physics and chemistry to basic biological problems, coining the term ''[[molecular biology]]'' for this approach in 1938; many of the significant biological breakthroughs of the 1930s and 1940s were funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.<ref>Morange, ''A History of Molecular Biology'', chapter 8; Kay, ''The Molecular Vision of Life'', Introduction, Interlude I, and Interlude II</ref>\n\n[[File:TMV virus under magnification.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wendell Meredith Stanley|Wendell Stanley]]'s crystallization of [[tobacco mosaic virus]] as a pure [[nucleoprotein]] in 1935 convinced many scientists that heredity might be explained purely through physics and chemistry.]]\n\nLike biochemistry, the overlapping disciplines of [[bacteriology]] and [[virology]] (later combined as ''microbiology''), situated between science and medicine, developed rapidly in the early 20th century. [[F\u00e9lix d'Herelle]]'s isolation of [[bacteriophage]] during World War I initiated a long line of research focused on phage viruses and the bacteria they infect.<ref>See: Summers, ''F\u00e9lix d'Herelle and the Origins of Molecular Biology''</ref>\n\nThe development of standard, genetically uniform organisms that could produce repeatable experimental results was essential for the development of [[molecular genetics]]. After early work with ''Drosophila'' and [[maize]], the adoption of simpler [[Scientific modelling|model system]]s like the bread mold ''[[Neurospora crassa]]'' made it possible to connect genetics to biochemistry, most importantly with [[George Wells Beadle|Beadle]] and [[Edward Lawrie Tatum|Tatum]]'s [[one gene-one enzyme hypothesis]] in 1941. Genetics experiments on even simpler systems like [[tobacco mosaic virus]] and [[bacteriophage]], aided by the new technologies of [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]] and [[ultracentrifuge|ultracentrifugation]], forced scientists to re-evaluate the literal meaning of ''life''; virus heredity and reproducing [[nucleoprotein]] cell structures outside the nucleus (\"plasmagenes\") complicated the accepted Mendelian-chromosome theory.<ref>Creager, ''The Life of a Virus'', chapters 3 and 6; Morange, ''A History of Molecular Biology'', chapter 2</ref>\n\n[[File:Crick's 1958 central dogma.svg|thumb|The \"[[central dogma of molecular biology]]\" (originally a \"dogma\" only in jest) was proposed by Francis Crick in 1958.<ref>{{Cite journal| first1 = F. | title = Central Dogma of Molecular Biology | journal = Nature | volume = 227| last1 = Crick| issue = 5258 | pages = 561\u2013563 | year = 1970| pmid = 4913914 | doi = 10.1038/227561a0|bibcode = 1970Natur.227..561C }}</ref> This is Crick's reconstruction of how he conceived of the central dogma at the time.

In 1953 [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]], building on the work of [[Maurice Wilkins]] and [[Rosalind Franklin]], suggested that the structure of DNA was a double helix. In their famous paper \"[[Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids]]\", Watson and Crick noted coyly, \"It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.\"<ref>Watson, James D. and Francis Crick. \"[http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watsoncrick.pdf Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid]\", ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', vol. 171, no. 4356, pp 737\u2013738</ref> After the 1958 [[Meselson\u2013Stahl experiment]] confirmed the [[semiconservative replication]] of DNA, it was clear to most biologists that nucleic acid sequence must somehow determine [[Peptide sequence|amino acid sequence]] in proteins; physicist [[George Gamow]] proposed that a fixed [[genetic code]] connected proteins and DNA. Between 1953 and 1961, there were few known biological sequences\u2014either DNA or protein\u2014but an abundance of proposed code systems, a situation made even more complicated by expanding knowledge of the intermediate role of [[RNA]]. To actually decipher the code, it took an extensive series of experiments in biochemistry and bacterial genetics, between 1961 and 1966\u2014most importantly the work of [[Marshall Warren Nirenberg|Nirenberg]] and [[Har Gobind Khorana|Khorana]].<ref>Morange, ''A History of Molecular Biology'', chapters 3, 4, 11, and 12; Fruton, ''Proteins, Enzymes, Genes'', chapter 8; on the Meselson-Stahl experiment, see: Holmes, ''Meselson, Stahl, and the Replication of DNA''</ref>\n\n====Expansion of molecular biology====\nIn addition to the Division of Biology at [[Caltech]], the [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]] (and its precursors) at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], and a handful of other institutions, the [[Pasteur Institute]] became a major center for molecular biology research in the late 1950s.<ref>On Caltech molecular biology, see Kay, ''The Molecular Vision of Life'', chapters 4\u20138; on the Cambridge lab, see de Chadarevian, ''Designs for Life''; on comparisons with the Pasteur Institute, see Creager, \"Building Biology across the Atlantic\"</ref> Scientists at Cambridge, led by [[Max Perutz]] and [[John Kendrew]], focused on the rapidly developing field of [[structural biology]], combining [[X-ray crystallography]] with [[Molecular modelling]] and the new computational possibilities of [[History of computing hardware|digital computing]] (benefiting both directly and indirectly from the [[military funding of science]]). A number of biochemists led by [[Frederick Sanger]] later joined the Cambridge lab, bringing together the study of [[macromolecule|macromolecular]] structure and function.<ref>de Chadarevian, ''Designs for Life'', chapters 4 and 7</ref> At the Pasteur Institute, [[Fran\u00e7ois Jacob]] and [[Jacques Monod]] followed the 1959 [[Arthur Pardee#The PaJaMo experiment|PaJaMo experiment]] with a series of publications regarding the [[lac operon|''lac'']] [[operon]] that established the concept of [[gene regulation]] and identified what came to be known as [[messenger RNA]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pardee A |title=PaJaMas in Paris |journal=Trends Genet. |volume=18 |issue=11 |pages=585\u20137 |year=2002 |pmid=12414189 |doi=10.1016/S0168-9525(02)02780-4}}</ref> By the mid-1960s, the intellectual core of molecular biology\u2014a model for the molecular basis of metabolism and reproduction\u2014 was largely complete.<ref>Morange, ''A History of Molecular Biology'', chapter 14</ref>\n\nThe late 1950s to the early 1970s was a period of intense research and institutional expansion for molecular biology, which had only recently become a somewhat coherent discipline. In what organismic biologist [[E. O. Wilson]] called \"The Molecular Wars\", the methods and practitioners of molecular biology spread rapidly, often coming to dominate departments and even entire disciplines.<ref>Wilson, ''Naturalist'', chapter 12; Morange, ''A History of Molecular Biology, chapter 15</ref> Molecularization was particularly important in [[genetics]], [[immunology]], [[embryology]], and [[neurobiology]], while the idea that life is controlled by a \"[[genetic program]]\"\u2014a metaphor Jacob and Monod introduced from the emerging fields of [[cybernetics]] and [[computer science]]\u2014became an influential perspective throughout biology.<ref>Morange, ''A History of Molecular Biology'', chapter 15; Keller, ''The Century of the Gene'', chapter 5</ref> Immunology in particular became linked with molecular biology, with innovation flowing both ways: the [[clonal selection theory]] developed by [[Niels Jerne]] and [[Frank Macfarlane Burnet]] in the mid-1950s helped shed light on the general mechanisms of protein synthesis.<ref>Morange, ''A History of Molecular Biology, pp 126\u2013132, 213\u2013214</ref>\n\nResistance to the growing influence of molecular biology was especially evident in [[evolutionary biology]]. [[Protein sequencing]] had great potential for the quantitative study of evolution (through the [[molecular clock hypothesis]]), but leading evolutionary biologists questioned the relevance of molecular biology for answering the big questions of evolutionary causation. Departments and disciplines fractured as organismic biologists asserted their importance and independence: [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] made the famous statement that \"[[nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution]]\" as a response to the molecular challenge. The issue became even more critical after 1968; [[Motoo Kimura]]'s [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]] suggested that [[natural selection]] was not the ubiquitous cause of evolution, at least at the molecular level, and that molecular evolution might be a fundamentally different process from [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] evolution. (Resolving this \"molecular/morphological paradox\" has been a central focus of molecular evolution research since the 1960s.)<ref>Dietrich, \"Paradox and Persuasion\", pp 100\u2013111</ref>\n\n===Biotechnology, genetic engineering, and genomics===\n{{see also|History of biotechnology}}\n\n[[Biotechnology]] in the general sense has been an important part of biology since the late 19th century. With the industrialization of [[brewing]] and [[agriculture]], chemists and biologists became aware of the great potential of human-controlled biological processes. In particular, [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] proved a great boon to chemical industries. By the early 1970s, a wide range of biotechnologies were being developed, from drugs like [[penicillin]] and [[steroids]] to foods like ''[[Chlorella]]'' and single-cell protein to [[gasohol]]\u2014as well as a wide range of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] [[high-yield crop]]s and agricultural technologies, the basis for the [[Green Revolution]].<ref>Bud, ''The Uses of Life'', chapters 2 and 6</ref>\n\n[[File:E coli at 10000x, original.jpg|thumb|left|Carefully engineered [[Strain (biology)|strains]] of the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' are crucial tools in biotechnology as well as many other biological fields.]]\n\n====Recombinant DNA====\nBiotechnology in the modern sense of [[genetic engineering]] began in the 1970s, with the invention of [[recombinant DNA]] techniques.<ref>Agar, ''Science in the Twentieth Century and Beyond'', p. 436</ref> [[Restriction enzyme]]s were discovered and characterized in the late 1960s, following on the heels of the isolation, then duplication, then synthesis of viral [[genes]]. Beginning with the lab of [[Paul Berg]] in 1972 (aided by ''[[EcoRI]]'' from [[Herbert Boyer]]'s lab, building on work with [[ligase]] by [[Arthur Kornberg]]'s lab), molecular biologists put these pieces together to produce the first [[transgenic organisms]]. Soon after, others began using [[plasmid]] [[Vector (molecular biology)|vectors]] and adding genes for [[antibiotic resistance]], greatly increasing the reach of the recombinant techniques.<ref>Morange, ''A History of Molecular Biology'', chapters 15 and 16</ref>\n\nWary of the potential dangers (particularly the possibility of a prolific bacteria with a viral cancer-causing gene), the scientific community as well as a wide range of scientific outsiders reacted to these developments with both enthusiasm and fearful restraint. Prominent molecular biologists led by Berg suggested a temporary moratorium on recombinant DNA research until the dangers could be assessed and policies could be created. This moratorium was largely respected, until the participants in the 1975 [[Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA]] created policy recommendations and concluded that the technology could be used safely.<ref>Bud, ''The Uses of Life'', chapter 8; Gottweis, ''Governing Molecules'', chapter 3; Morange, ''A History of Molecular Biology'', chapter 16</ref>\n\nFollowing Asilomar, new genetic engineering techniques and applications developed rapidly. [[DNA sequencing]] methods improved greatly (pioneered by [[Frederick Sanger]] and [[Walter Gilbert]]), as did [[oligonucleotide]] synthesis and [[transfection]] techniques.<ref>Morange, ''A History of Molecular Biology'', chapter 16</ref> Researchers learned to control the expression of [[transgene]]s, and were soon racing\u2014in both academic and industrial contexts\u2014to create organisms capable of expressing human genes for the production of human hormones. However, this was a more daunting task than molecular biologists had expected; developments between 1977 and 1980 showed that, due to the phenomena of split genes and [[splicing (genetics)|splicing]], higher organisms had a much more complex system of [[gene expression]] than the bacteria models of earlier studies.<ref>Morange, ''A History of Molecular Biology'', chapter 17</ref> The first such race, for synthesizing human [[insulin]], was won by [[Genentech]]. This marked the beginning of the biotech boom (and with it, the era of [[gene patent]]s), with an unprecedented level of overlap between biology, industry, and law.<ref>Krimsky, ''Biotechnics and Society'', chapter 2; on the race for insulin, see: Hall, ''Invisible Frontiers''; see also: Thackray (ed.), ''Private Science''</ref>\n\n====Molecular systematics and genomics====\n{{see also|History of molecular evolution}}\n[[File:Cycler.jpg|thumb|upright|Inside of a 48-well [[thermal cycler]], a device used to perform [[polymerase chain reaction]] on many samples at once]]\n\nBy the 1980s, protein sequencing had already transformed methods of [[scientific classification]] of organisms (especially [[cladistics]]) but biologists soon began to use RNA and DNA sequences as [[Trait (biology)|characters]]; this expanded the significance of [[molecular evolution]] within evolutionary biology, as the results of [[molecular systematics]] could be compared with traditional evolutionary trees based on [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]. Following the pioneering ideas of [[Lynn Margulis]] on [[endosymbiotic theory]], which holds that some of the [[organelles]] of [[eukaryotic]] cells originated from free living [[prokaryotic]] organisms through [[symbiotic]] relationships, even the overall division of the tree of life was revised. Into the 1990s, the five domains (Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists, and Monerans) became three (the [[Archaea]], the [[Bacteria]], and the [[Eukarya]]) based on [[Carl Woese]]'s pioneering [[molecular systematics]] work with [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]] sequencing.<ref>Sapp, ''Genesis'', chapters 18 and 19</ref>\n\nThe development and popularization of the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) in mid-1980s (by [[Kary Mullis]] and others at [[Cetus Corp.]]) marked another watershed in the history of modern biotechnology, greatly increasing the ease and speed of genetic analysis.<ref>Agar, ''Science in the Twentieth Century and Beyond'', p. 456</ref> Coupled with the use of [[expressed sequence tags]], PCR led to the discovery of many more genes than could be found through traditional biochemical or genetic methods and opened the possibility of sequencing entire genomes.<ref>Morange, ''A History of Molecular Biology'', chapter 20; see also: Rabinow, ''Making PCR''</ref>\n\nThe unity of much of the [[morphogenesis]] of organisms from fertilized egg to adult began to be unraveled after the discovery of the [[homeobox]] genes, first in fruit flies, then in other insects and animals, including humans. These developments led to advances in the field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] towards understanding how the various [[body plan]]s of the animal phyla have evolved and how they are related to one another.<ref>Gould, ''The Structure of Evolutionary Theory'', chapter 10</ref>\n\nThe [[Human Genome Project]]\u2014the largest, most costly single biological study ever undertaken\u2014began in 1988 under the leadership of [[James D. Watson]], after preliminary work with genetically simpler model organisms such as ''[[E. coli]]'', ''[[S. cerevisiae]]'' and ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]''. [[Shotgun sequencing]] and gene discovery methods pioneered by [[Craig Venter]]\u2014and fueled by the financial promise of gene patents with [[Celera Genomics]]\u2014 led to a public\u2013private sequencing competition that ended in compromise with the first draft of the human DNA sequence announced in 2000.<ref>Davies, ''Cracking the Genome'', Introduction; see also: Sulston, ''The Common Thread''</ref>\n\n==Twenty-first century biological sciences==\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, biological sciences converged with previously differentiated new and classic disciplines like [[Physics]] into research fields like [[Biophysics]].  Advances were made in [[analytical chemistry]] and physics instrumentation including improved sensors, optics, tracers, instrumentation, signal processing, networks, robots, satellites, and compute power for data collection, storage, analysis, modeling, visualization, and simulations.  These technology advances allowed theoretical and experimental research including internet publication of molecular biochemistry, [[biological system]]s, and ecosystems science.  This enabled worldwide access to better measurements, theoretical models, complex simulations, theory predictive model experimentation, analysis, worldwide internet observational [[data reporting]], open peer-review, collaboration, and internet publication.  New fields of biological sciences research emerged including [[Bioinformatics]], [[Neuroscience]], [[Theoretical biology]], [[Computational genomics]], [[Astrobiology]] and [[Synthetic Biology]].\n==See also==\n\n* [[Outline of biology]]\n* [[Timeline of biology and organic chemistry]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Format footnotes|date=October 2018}}\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|60em}}\n* Agar, Jon.

It is noted for the F4 tornado that hit [[Wichita Falls, Texas]], and is commonly referred to as \"'''Terrible Tuesday'''\" by many meteorologists. Additional tornadoes were reported across the Southern Plains as well as in the Mississippi River Valley on April 10\u201311, 1979.\n\n==Formation of the tornadoes==\nA deepening [[low pressure system]] formed in [[Colorado]] as a [[warm front]] lifted north pulling warm, moist, unstable air. There was strong upper level dynamics all coming together to produce strong tornado-producing supercells. In the early afternoon hours, three [[supercell thunderstorm]]s formed. They moved northeastward, and as a trio spawned families of tornadoes. These supercells caused the most damaging tornadoes of the outbreak.\n\nThe first tornado formed near [[Crowell, Texas]], at around 3:05&nbsp;p.m. About 35 minutes later, the first killer one of the outbreak ripped through [[Vernon, Texas|Vernon]] and killed 11 people. Then the supercell spawned one that killed three people in [[Lawton, Oklahoma]]. The second supercell spawned one that moved {{convert|64|mi|km|}}.\n\n[[Image:Wftornado3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|More destruction from the Wichita Falls tornado]]\n\n===Wichita Falls, Texas===\nThe third supercell was the one that formed the [[Seymour, Texas|Seymour]] and [[Wichita Falls, Texas|Wichita Falls]] tornadoes as part of a three-member [[tornado family]]. The first tornado formed near Seymour at around 4:53 pm. The storm spawned a second tornado that moved through the south and east sides of Wichita Falls at around 6:00 pm. The third member of the family formed near [[Waurika, Oklahoma]], at around 8:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\nThe flipside flop tornado formed in [[Archer County, Texas|Archer County]] and moved northeast and damaged a few rural homes and high voltage towers. It rapidly intensified as it entered the city near Memorial Stadium by McNiel Jr. High on Southwest Parkway, which was located to the west of Wichita Falls at approximately 6:07&nbsp;p.m. damaging both structures severely. Hail the size of golf balls preceded the touchdown and continued for approximately 15 minutes. It then became calm before the winds began to pick up. The winds picked up fariy's, mermaids, unicorns, and ripped their heads off one by one. The humans watched in awe as it happened not even caring that blood was raining down on their faces.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 0 0.5em 1em;float:right;\"\n|+'''Outbreak death toll'''\n|-poof goes a fariy\n!'''State'''\n!'''Total'''\n!'''County'''\n!'''County<br />total'''\n|-\n|rowspan=1 bgcolor=\"#e6e9ff\"|[[Indiana]]\n|rowspan=1 bgcolor=\"#e6e9ff\"|'''1'''\n|[[Warrick County, Indiana|Warrick]]\n|1\n|-\n|rowspan=1 bgcolor=\"#e6e9ff\"|[[Oklahoma]]\n|rowspan=1 bgcolor=\"#e6e9ff\"|'''3'''\n|[[Comanche County, Oklahoma|Comanche]]\n|3\n|-\n|rowspan=2 bgcolor=\"#e6e9ff\"|[[Texas]]\n|rowspan=2 bgcolor=\"#e6e9ff\"|'''54'''\n|[[Wichita County, Texas|Wichita]]\n|42\n|-\n|[[Wilbarger County, Texas|Wilbarger]]\n|12\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#e6e9ff\"|Totals\n|bgcolor=\"#e6e9ff\"|'''58'''\n|colspan=2|\n|-\n|colspan=4 align=center| <small>All deaths were tornado-related,</small>\n|-\n|}\n\nThe massive wedge tornado, which was at its maximum {{convert|1.5|mi|km|}} wide, cut a {{convert|2.5|mi|km|adj=on}} swath of destruction through the south side of town, leveling everything in its path. It destroyed an apartment complex near the beginning of its path. It also took its first lives there. It later destroyed a restaurant, the majority of Sikes Senter, the major mall, and another apartment complex where it took more lives. Neighborhoods all along Southwest Parkway were leveled and nothing but debris and destruction remained.\n\nA number of people tried to flee as the tornado moved along [[U.S. Route 281|U.S. Highways 281]] and [[U.S. Route 287|287]]. Roughly half of the 46 people killed were killed in their cars. It then moved into [[Clay County, Texas|Clay County]] and changed its appearance to display a [[Multiple-vortex tornado|multiple-vortex structure]]. There were at times 5 separate vortices visible within the tornado. It inflicted additional damage south of Dean and Byers, but no more fatalities occurred. It crossed into Oklahoma where additional damage occurred before it dissipated.\n\n==Damage==\nAt the end of the outbreak, 54 people lost their lives in Texas, three were killed in Oklahoma and one was killed in [[Indiana]]. The Wichita Falls tornado alone killed 42 people and caused $400 million in damage (${{Formatprice| {{Inflation|US|1141000000|1997|r=2}}}} in today's dollars).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Brooks |first=Harold E. |authorlink=Harold E.

It is noted for the F4 tornado that hit [[Wichita Falls, Texas]], and is commonly referred to as \"'''Terrible Tuesday'''\" by many meteorologists. Additional tornadoes were reported across the Southern Plains as well as in the Mississippi River Valley on April 10\u201311, 1979.\n\n==Formation of the tornadoes==\nA deepening [[low pressure system]] formed in [[Colorado]] as a [[warm front]] lifted north pulling warm, moist, unstable air. There was strong upper level dynamics all coming together to produce strong tornado-producing supercells. In the early afternoon hours, three [[supercell thunderstorm]]s formed. They moved northeastward, and as a trio spawned families of tornadoes. These supercells caused the most damaging tornadoes of the outbreak.\n\nThe first tornado formed near [[Crowell, Texas]], at around 3:05&nbsp;p.m. About 35 minutes later, the first killer one of the outbreak ripped through [[Vernon, Texas|Vernon]] and killed 11 people. Then the supercell spawned one that killed three people in [[Lawton, Oklahoma]]. The second supercell spawned one that moved {{convert|64|mi|km|}}.\n\n[[Image:Wftornado3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|More destruction from the Wichita Falls tornado]]\n\n===Wichita Falls, Texas===\nThe third supercell was the one that formed the [[Seymour, Texas|Seymour]] and [[Wichita Falls, Texas|Wichita Falls]] tornadoes as part of a three-member [[tornado family]]. The first tornado formed near Seymour at around 4:53 pm. The storm spawned a second tornado that moved through the south and east sides of Wichita Falls at around 6:00 pm. The third member of the family formed near [[Waurika, Oklahoma]], at around 8:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\nThe Wichita Falls tornado formed in [[Archer County, Texas|Archer County]] and moved northeast and damaged a few rural homes and high voltage towers. It rapidly intensified as it entered the city near Memorial Stadium by McNiel Jr. High on Southwest Parkway, which was located to the west of Wichita Falls at approximately 6:07&nbsp;p.m. damaging both structures severely. Hail the size of golf balls preceded the touchdown and continued for approximately 15 minutes. It then became calm before the winds began to pick up.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 0 0.5em 1em;float:right;\"\n|+'''Outbreak death toll'''\n|-\n!'''State'''\n!'''Total'''\n!'''County'''\n!'''County<br />total'''\n|-\n|rowspan=1 bgcolor=\"#e6e9ff\"|[[Indiana]]\n|rowspan=1 bgcolor=\"#e6e9ff\"|'''1'''\n|[[Warrick County, Indiana|Warrick]]\n|1\n|-\n|rowspan=1 bgcolor=\"#e6e9ff\"|[[Oklahoma]]\n|rowspan=1 bgcolor=\"#e6e9ff\"|'''3'''\n|[[Comanche County, Oklahoma|Comanche]]\n|3\n|-\n|rowspan=2 bgcolor=\"#e6e9ff\"|[[Texas]]\n|rowspan=2 bgcolor=\"#e6e9ff\"|'''54'''\n|[[Wichita County, Texas|Wichita]]\n|42\n|-\n|[[Wilbarger County, Texas|Wilbarger]]\n|12\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#e6e9ff\"|Totals\n|bgcolor=\"#e6e9ff\"|'''58'''\n|colspan=2|\n|-\n|colspan=4 align=center| <small>All deaths were tornado-related,</small>\n|-\n|}\n\nThe massive wedge tornado, which was at its maximum {{convert|1.5|mi|km|}} wide, cut a {{convert|2.5|mi|km|adj=on}} swath of destruction through the south side of town, leveling everything in its path. It destroyed an apartment complex near the beginning of its path. It also took its first lives there. It later destroyed a restaurant, the majority of Sikes Senter, the major mall, and another apartment complex where it took more lives. Neighborhoods all along Southwest Parkway were leveled and nothing but debris and destruction remained.\n\nA number of people tried to flee as the tornado moved along [[U.S. Route 281|U.S. Highways 281]] and [[U.S. Route 287|287]]. Roughly half of the 46 people killed were killed in their cars. It then moved into [[Clay County, Texas|Clay County]] and changed its appearance to display a [[Multiple-vortex tornado|multiple-vortex structure]]. There were at times 5 separate vortices visible within the tornado. It inflicted additional damage south of Dean and Byers, but no more fatalities occurred. It crossed into Oklahoma where additional damage occurred before it dissipated.\n\n==Damage==\nAt the end of the outbreak, 54 people lost their lives in Texas, three were killed in Oklahoma and one was killed in [[Indiana]]. The Wichita Falls tornado alone killed 42 people and caused $400 million in damage (${{Formatprice| {{Inflation|US|1141000000|1997|r=2}}}} in today's dollars).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Brooks |first=Harold E. |authorlink=Harold E.

In much of [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] it is regularly realized as something reminiscent of a glottal stop.{{clarify|date=December 2019}} A probably-unrelated glottal stop, with quite different distribution rules, occurs in Western [[Jutland]] and is known as the {{lang|da|vestjysk st\u00f8d}} ('West Jutland st\u00f8d'). Because [[Dania transcription|Dania]], the phonetic alphabet based on IPA that is designed specifically for Danish, uses the IPA character {{angbr IPA|\u0294}} (intended as a glottal stop) broadly to transcribe st\u00f8d, it may be mistaken for a consonant, rather than a suprasegmental phonation. The word ''st\u00f8d'' itself does not have a st\u00f8d.<ref name=\"ddo\" />\n\n==Phonetics==\nThe st\u00f8d has sometimes been described as a [[glottal stop]], but acoustic analyses have shown that there is rarely a full stop of the airflow involved in its production. Rather it is a form of [[laryngealization]] or [[creaky voice]], that affects the [[phonation]] of a syllable by dividing it into two phases. The first phase has a relatively high intensity and a high pitch (measured as [[Fundamental frequency|F0]]), whereas the second phase sees a drop in intensity and pitch.{{sfn|Fischer-J\u00f8rgensen|1989}}\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Listen\n| filename    = DA-st\u00f8d ex Hun Hund.ogg\n| title       = Spoken sample\n| description = Pronunciation of {{lang|da|hun}} ('she', no st\u00f8d) and {{lang|da|hund}} ('dog', with st\u00f8d)\n| pos         = right\n}}\nDanish linguists such as [[Eli Fischer-J\u00f8rgensen]], [[Nina Gr\u00f8nnum]] and [[Hans Basb\u00f8ll]] have generally considered st\u00f8d to be a suprasegmental phenomenon related to phonation and accent. Basb\u00f8ll defines it as a \"laryngeal syllable rhyme prosody\".{{sfn|Basb\u00f8ll|2014}}\n\nThe phonology of the st\u00f8d has been widely studied, and several different analyses have been elaborated to account for it. Most of the time the presence of st\u00f8d in a word is predictable based on information about the syllable structure of the word. But there are minimal pairs where the presence or absence of st\u00f8d determines meaning:{{sfn|Riad|2003|p=263}}\n\n{|\n|'''No st\u00f8d''' || '''St\u00f8d'''||\n|-\n|{{lang|da|hun}} {{IPA|/hun/}}<br /> 'she'|| {{lang|da|hund}} {{IPA|/hun\u02c0/}} <br /> 'dog'||\n|-\n|{{lang|da|ven}} {{IPA|/v\u025bn/}}<br /> 'friend'|| {{lang|da|vend!}} {{IPA|/v\u025bn\u02c0/}} <br />'turn around ([[Imperative mood|imperative]])'||\n|-\n|{{lang|da|l\u00e6ser}} {{IPA|/\u02c8l\u025b\u02d0s\u0250/}}<br />'reader'|| {{lang|da|l\u00e6ser}} {{IPA|/\u02c8l\u025b\u02d0\u02c0s\u0250/}}<br />'reads' ||\n|-\n|{{lang|da|maler}} {{IPA|/\u02c8m\u00e6\u02d0l\u0250/}}<br />'painter'|| {{lang|da|maler}} {{IPA|/\u02c8m\u00e6\u02d0\u02c0l\u0250/}}<br />'paints' ||\n|-\n|{{lang|da|h\u00e6nder}} {{IPA|/\u02c8h\u025bn\u0250/}} <br /> 'happens'||{{lang|da|h\u00e6nder}} {{IPA|/\u02c8h\u025bn\u02c0\u0250/}}<br /> 'hands' ||\n|-\n|st\u00f8d {{IPA|/sd\u0325\u00f8\u00f0/}} <br /> 'thrust' (noun)||st\u00f8d {{IPA|/sd\u0325\u00f8\u00f0\u02c0/}}<br /> 'thrust' (imperative)||\n|}\n\n===St\u00f8d-basis and alternations===\nTwo-syllable words with accent on the first syllable do not take st\u00f8d, nor do closed monosyllables ending in a non-sonorant.{{sfn|Riad|2003|p=264}} In Standard Danish, st\u00f8d is mainly found in words that have certain phonological patterns, namely those that have a heavy stressed syllable, with a coda of a sonorant or semivowel (i.e. words ending in vowel + {{IPA|/r, j, v/}}) or one of the [[consonant]] [[phoneme]]s {{IPA|/m, n, \u014b, l, d/}}. This phonological structure is called \"st\u00f8d-basis\" (or \"{{lang|da|st\u00f8dbasis}}\" in the literature). In the st\u00f8d-basis model, st\u00f8d is possible only on syllables that have this basis, but secondary rules need to be formulated to account for which syllables with st\u00f8d-basis actually carry the st\u00f8d.\n\nSome words alternate morphologically with st\u00f8d-carrying and st\u00f8d-less forms, for example {{lang|da|gul}} {{IPA|[g\u030au\u02d0\u02c0l]}} 'yellow (singular)' and {{lang|da|gule}} {{IPA|[\u02c8g\u030au\u02d0l\u0259]}} 'yellow (plural)'.{{sfn|Riad|2003|p=265}} Gr\u00f8nnum considers st\u00f8d to be non-phonemic in monosyllables with long vowels (she analyzes the phonemic structure of the word {{lang|da|lim}} {{IPA|[li\u02d0\u02c0m]}} 'glue' pronounced as {{IPA|/li\u02d0m/}}), whereas Basb\u00f8ll considers it phonemic also in this environment (analyzing it instead as {{IPA|/li\u02d0\u02c0m/}}, contrasting with the structure of {{IPA|/ti\u02d0m/}} 'team').{{sfn|Basb\u00f8ll|2005|p=86}}\n\n===Tonal analysis===\nFollowing an earlier suggestion by Ito and Mester, {{harvcoltxt|Riad|2003}} analyzes st\u00f8d as a surface manifestation of an underlying High-Low tone pattern across two syllables. Riad traces the history of st\u00f8d to a tonal system similar to that found in the contemporary Swedish dialects of [[M\u00e4lardalen]], particularly that of [[Eskilstuna]].{{sfn|Riad|2009}} The argument is based both on the phonetic similarity between the st\u00f8d, characterized by a sharp drop in the F0 formant, and the same phenomenon found in some tonal systems, and also on the historical fact that tonal accents are considered to have historically existed prior to the st\u00f8d system. A 2013 study by Gr\u00f8nnum, Vazquez-Larrusca\u00edn and Basb\u00f8ll however found that the tonal hypothesis was unable to successfully account for the distribution of st\u00f8d.{{sfn|Gr\u00f8nnum|Vazquez-Larrusca\u00edn|Basb\u00f8ll|2013}} The analysis has also been critiqued by {{harvcoltxt|Gress-Wright|2008}}, who prefers a model similar to Basb\u00f8ll's.\n\n===Basb\u00f8ll's analysis===\n{{harvcoltxt|Basb\u00f8ll|2005}} gives an analysis of st\u00f8d based on [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] and syllable weight measured in terms of [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]]. He analyzes Danish as having two kinds of syllables, {{lang|da|monomoraic}} and {{lang|da|bimoraic}} syllables. Unstressed syllables, syllables with short vowels, and non-sonorant codas are considered monomoraic, whereas stressed syllables with long vowels, or with short vowels followed by a coda sonorants are considered bimoraic. In Basb\u00f8ll's analysis, st\u00f8d marks the beginning of the second mora in ultimate and antepenultimate syllables, although he recognizes that phonetically the situation is more complex as phonetic experiments have shown that the effects of st\u00f8d occur across the entire syllable.{{sfn|Gr\u00f8nnum|Basb\u00f8ll|2007}} St\u00f8d thus can only be found in \"heavy\" bimoraic rhyme syllables, but never in \"light\" (monomoraic) syllables. In this analysis, the notion of st\u00f8d-basis is unnecessary, and the only thing that needs to be accounted for are those cases where syllables that ought to carry st\u00f8d according to the model, in fact do not, e.g. words like {{lang|da|\u00f8l}}, 'beer', and {{lang|da|ven}}, 'friend'. Basb\u00f8ll accounts for these by positing that the final sonorants in these cases are extraprosodic, meaning that they are simply not counting towards the moraic weight of the syllable to which they belong. This accounts for the resurfacing of st\u00f8d when such words are followed by a syllabic consonant such as the definite suffix (e.g. {{lang|da|vennen}} {{IPA|[\u02c8v\u025bn\u02c0n\u0329]}}, 'the friend' ), but not when they are followed by a syllable with a vowel (e.g. {{lang|da|venner}} {{IPA|[\u02c8v\u025bn\u0250]}}, 'friends').

But some scholars have suggested that it goes back to the original population groups and that the line between st\u00f8d and non-st\u00f8d dialects represent an ancient invasion from the south.{{sfn|Kroman|1980}}\n\nSt\u00f8d was first mentioned in the 1743 second treatise on orthography of [[Jens Pedersen H\u00f8ysgaard]], where he described it as stop of the breath caused by the closing of the pharynx.

In much of [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] it is regularly realized as something reminiscent of a glottal stop.{{clarify|date=December 2019}} A probably-unrelated glottal stop, with quite different distribution rules, occurs in Western [[Jutland]] and is known as the {{lang|da|vestjysk st\u00f8d}} ('West Jutland st\u00f8d'). Because [[Dania transcription|Dania]], the phonetic alphabet based on IPA that is designed specifically for Danish, uses the IPA character {{angbr IPA|\u0294}} (intended as a glottal stop) broadly to transcribe st\u00f8d, it may be mistaken for a consonant, rather than a suprasegmental phonation. The word ''st\u00f8d'' itself does not have a st\u00f8d.<ref name=\"ddo\" />\n\n==Phonetics==\nThe st\u00f8d has sometimes been described as a [[glottal stop]], but acoustic analyses have shown that there is rarely a full stop of the airflow involved in its production. Rather it is a form of [[laryngealization]] or [[creaky voice]], that affects the [[phonation]] of a syllable by dividing it into two phases. The first phase has a relatively high intensity and a high pitch (measured as [[Fundamental frequency|F0]]), whereas the second phase sees a drop in intensity and pitch.{{sfn|Fischer-J\u00f8rgensen|1989}}\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Listen\n| filename    = DA-st\u00f8d ex Hun Hund.ogg\n| title       = Spoken sample\n| description = Pronunciation of {{lang|da|hun}} ('she', no st\u00f8d) and {{lang|da|hund}} ('dog', with st\u00f8d)\n| pos         = right\n}}\nDanish linguists such as [[Eli Fischer-J\u00f8rgensen]], [[Nina Gr\u00f8nnum]] and [[Hans Basb\u00f8ll]] have generally considered st\u00f8d to be a suprasegmental phenomenon related to phonation and accent.

This phonological structure is called \"st\u00f8d-basis\" (or \"{{lang|da|st\u00f8dbasis}}\" in the literature). In the st\u00f8d-basis model, st\u00f8d is possible only on syllables that have this basis, but secondary rules need to be formulated to account for which syllables with st\u00f8d-basis actually carry the st\u00f8d.\n\nSome words alternate morphologically with st\u00f8d-carrying and st\u00f8d-less forms, for example {{lang|da|gul}} {{IPA|[g\u030au\u02d0\u02c0l]}} 'yellow (singular)' and {{lang|da|gule}} {{IPA|[\u02c8g\u030au\u02d0l\u0259]}} 'yellow (plural)'.{{sfn|Riad|2003|p=265}} Gr\u00f8nnum considers st\u00f8d to be non-phonemic in monosyllables with long vowels (she analyzes the phonemic structure of the word {{lang|da|lim}} {{IPA|[li\u02d0\u02c0m]}} 'glue' pronounced as {{IPA|/li\u02d0m/}}), whereas Basb\u00f8ll considers it phonemic also in this environment (analyzing it instead as {{IPA|/li\u02d0\u02c0m/}}, contrasting with the structure of {{IPA|/ti\u02d0m/}} 'team').{{sfn|Basb\u00f8ll|2005|p=86}}\n\n===Tonal analysis===\nFollowing an earlier suggestion by Ito and Mester, {{harvcoltxt|Riad|2003}} analyzes st\u00f8d as a surface manifestation of an underlying High-Low tone pattern across two syllables. Riad traces the history of st\u00f8d to a tonal system similar to that found in the contemporary Swedish dialects of [[M\u00e4lardalen]], particularly that of [[Eskilstuna]].{{sfn|Riad|2009}} The argument is based both on the phonetic similarity between the st\u00f8d, characterized by a sharp drop in the F0 formant, and the same phenomenon found in some tonal systems, and also on the historical fact that tonal accents are considered to have historically existed prior to the st\u00f8d system. A 2013 study by Gr\u00f8nnum, Vazquez-Larrusca\u00edn and Basb\u00f8ll however found that the tonal hypothesis was unable to successfully account for the distribution of st\u00f8d.{{sfn|Gr\u00f8nnum|Vazquez-Larrusca\u00edn|Basb\u00f8ll|2013}} The analysis has also been critiqued by {{harvcoltxt|Gress-Wright|2008}}, who prefers a model similar to Basb\u00f8ll's.\n\n===Basb\u00f8ll's analysis===\n{{harvcoltxt|Basb\u00f8ll|2005}} gives an analysis of st\u00f8d based on [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] and syllable weight measured in terms of [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]]. He analyzes Danish as having two kinds of syllables, {{lang|da|monomoraic}} and {{lang|da|bimoraic}} syllables. Unstressed syllables, syllables with short vowels, and non-sonorant codas are considered monomoraic, whereas stressed syllables with long vowels, or with short vowels followed by a coda sonorants are considered bimoraic. In Basb\u00f8ll's analysis, st\u00f8d marks the beginning of the second mora in ultimate and antepenultimate syllables, although he recognizes that phonetically the situation is more complex as phonetic experiments have shown that the effects of st\u00f8d occur across the entire syllable.{{sfn|Gr\u00f8nnum|Basb\u00f8ll|2007}} St\u00f8d thus can only be found in \"heavy\" bimoraic rhyme syllables, but never in \"light\" (monomoraic) syllables. In this analysis, the notion of st\u00f8d-basis is unnecessary, and the only thing that needs to be accounted for are those cases where syllables that ought to carry st\u00f8d according to the model, in fact do not, e.g. words like {{lang|da|\u00f8l}}, 'beer', and {{lang|da|ven}}, 'friend'. Basb\u00f8ll accounts for these by positing that the final sonorants in these cases are extraprosodic, meaning that they are simply not counting towards the moraic weight of the syllable to which they belong. This accounts for the resurfacing of st\u00f8d when such words are followed by a syllabic consonant such as the definite suffix (e.g. {{lang|da|vennen}} {{IPA|[\u02c8v\u025bn\u02c0n\u0329]}}, 'the friend' ), but not when they are followed by a syllable with a vowel (e.g. {{lang|da|venner}} {{IPA|[\u02c8v\u025bn\u0250]}}, 'friends'). Another set of exceptions are assumed to be lexically coded as lacking st\u00f8d.\n\n==History==\n{{Quote box |width=300px |align=right |quoted=true |\n|salign=right\n|quote={{lang|da|Der till medh: sa wferdas de icke heller att talla som annat folck, uthan tryckia ordhen fram lika som the willia hosta, och synas endeles medh flitt forwendhe ordhen i strupan, for sen de komma fram ...}}<br />\nAlso this: nor do they stoop ('worthy themselves') to speak like other people, but press the words forward as if they will cough, and appear partly to deliberately turn the words around in the throat, before they come forward...|source=Hemming Gadh quoted by Johannes Magnus, 1554, ''Historia de omnibus Gothorum Sueonumque regibus''<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Basb\u00f8ll|2005|p=83}}</ref>}}\nDanish must have had st\u00f8d already in the 16th century as a speech against the Danes by a Swedish bishop, [[Hemming Gadh]], quoted by [[Johannes Magnus]], mentions a particular guttural cough associated with Danish.{{sfn|Basb\u00f8ll|2005|p=82}} Generally it has been considered that it must have arisen sometime in the late Middle Ages, perhaps around 1300. But some scholars have suggested that it goes back to the original population groups and that the line between st\u00f8d and non-st\u00f8d dialects represent an ancient invasion from the south.{{sfn|Kroman|1980}}\n\nSt\u00f8d was first mentioned in the 1743 second treatise on orthography of [[Jens Pedersen H\u00f8ysgaard]], where he described it as stop of the breath caused by the closing of the pharynx. He was also the one to propose the term {{lang|da|st\u00f8detone}}, \"thrust-tone\", later abbreviated to st\u00f8d.{{sfn|Fischer-J\u00f8rgensen|1989|p=6}}{{sfn|H\u00f8ysgaard|1743}}\n\nThe historical origin of st\u00f8d is a matter of debate, but it is systematically related to the word accents of Swedish and Norwegian:{{sfn|Basb\u00f8ll|2005|p=85}} It has been proposed that original Old Norse [[monosyllable]]s (not counting the [[article (grammar)|definite article]], which was still a separate word) received the st\u00f8d, while [[word]]s of two or more syllables did not.  This would explain why {{lang|da|hund}} {{IPA-da|\u02c8hun\u02c0|}} ('dog'), {{lang|da|hunden}} {{IPA-da|\u02c8hun\u02c0n\u0329|}} ('the dog') and {{lang|da|finger}} {{IPA-da|\u02c8fe\u014b\u02c0\u0250|}} ('finger'; Old Norse {{lang|non|fingr}} in one syllable) have the st\u00f8d in modern Danish, while {{lang|da|hunde}} {{IPA-da|\u02c8hun\u0259|}} ('dogs'), {{lang|da|hundene}} {{IPA-da|\u02c8hunn\u0329\u0259|}} ('the dogs') and {{lang|da|fingre}} {{IPA-da|\u02c8fe\u014b\u0281\u0250|}} ('fingers') do not.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nIt has also been proposed that it originated as a phonetic consequence of the original devoicing of Old Norse syllable-final voiced consonants in some dialect areas. This phonetic laryngealization was then phonemicized as the Scandinavian languages restructured nominal morphology introducing the definite suffixes.{{sfn|Panieri|2010}}\n\n==Dialectal variation==\n[[Image:Denmark-stoed.png|right|thumb|A map showing the distribution of st\u00f8d in Danish dialects.

There are four main regional variants for the realization of st\u00f8d:\n\n*In [[Southern Jutlandic]], Southernmost Funen, Southern Langeland, and \u00c6r\u00f8, there is no st\u00f8d but a [[pitch accent]].\n*South of a line ({{lang-da|St\u00f8dgr\u00e6nsen}}, 'St\u00f8d-border') that goes through central South Jutland and crosses Southern Funen and central Langeland and north of Lolland-Falster, M\u00f8n, Southern Zealand, and Bornholm, there is neither st\u00f8d nor pitch accent.<ref name=\"dialekt\">{{cite web |url=http://dialekt.ku.dk/dialekter/dialekttraek/stoed/ |title=St\u00f8d |publisher=University of Copenhagen, Center for Dialect Studies}}</ref>\n*In most of Jutland and on Zealand, there is st\u00f8d.\n*In Zealandic traditional dialects and regional language there are often more st\u00f8d occurrences than in the standard language.{{sfn|Ejskj\u00e6r|1990}} In Zealand, the st\u00f8d line divides Southern Zealand (without st\u00f8d), an area that used to be directly under the Crown, from the rest of Zealand, which used to be the property of various noble estates.<ref name=\"dialekt\" />\n\nIn the dialects with pitch accent, such as the South Jutlandic ({{lang|da|Synnejysk}}) of [[Als (island)|Als]], a low-level tone and a high-level tone  correspond to st\u00f8d and non-st\u00f8d in Standard Danish:{{sfn|Jespersen|1906|pp=127-128}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Word\n! scope=\"col\" | Standard Danish\n! scope=\"col\" | Southern Jutlandic\n|-\n| {{lang|da|dag}} <br />'day'\n| {{IPA|[da\u02c0]}}\n| {{IPA|[d\u00e0w]}}{{sfn|Jespersen|1906|pp=127-128}}\n|-\n| {{lang|da|dage}} <br />'days'\n| {{IPA|[da\u02d0\u0259]}}\n| {{IPA|[d\u01cew]}}{{sfn|Jespersen|1906|pp=127-128}}\n|}\n\nOn Zealand, some traditional dialects have a phenomenon called short vowel st\u00f8d ({{lang|da|kortvokalst\u00f8d}}); some monosyllabic words with a short vowel and a coda consonant cluster take a st\u00f8d if they are followed by the definite suffix: {{lang|da|pr\u00e6st}} {{IPA|[p\u0281\u00e6st]}} 'priest', but {{lang|da|pr\u00e6sten}} {{IPA|[\u02c8p\u0281\u00e6\u02c0stn\u0329]}} 'the priest'.{{sfn|S\u00f8rensen|2011}}\n\n===Western Jutlandic st\u00f8d===\nIn Western Jutland, a second st\u00f8d, more like a preconsonantal glottal stop, is employed in addition to the Standard Danish st\u00f8d.{{sfn|Basb\u00f8ll|2005|p=85}}{{sfn|Perridon|2006}}\n\nThe Western Jutlandic st\u00f8d is called {{lang|da|Vestjysk st\u00f8d}} or \"V-st\u00f8d\" in literature. It occurs in different environments, particularly after stressed vowels before final consonant clusters that arise by the elision of final unstressed vowels. For example, the word for 'to pull', which is {{IPA|/\u02c8tr\u00e6k\u0259/}} in Standard Danish, in Western Jutlandic is {{IPA|[t\u0281\u00e6\u0294k]}}, and the present tense form, in Standard Danish {{IPA|/\u02c8tr\u00e6k\u0250/}}, in Western Jutlandic is {{IPA|[\u02c8t\u0281\u00e6\u0294k\u0259]}}.{{sfn|Perridon|2006}}{{sfn|Perridon|2009}}{{sfn|Kortlandt|2010}} Some scholars have proposed that the {{lang|da|Vestjysk st\u00f8d}} is ancient,{{sfn|Kortlandt|2010}} but others consider it to be a more recent innovation.{{sfn|Perridon|2009}}\n\n==Similar phenomena in other languages==\n[[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]] and the [[Samogitian dialect|Samogitian]] dialect of [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] exhibit a similar phenomenon, known as \"broken tone\" ({{Lang|lv|lauzt\u0101 inton\u0101cija}}, {{Lang|ltg|lauztuo intonaceja}}), as did [[Livonian language|Livonian]], the extinct [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] language once spoken in [[Latvia]].{{sfn|Kiparsky|2006}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Danish phonology]]\n*[[Vocal fry register]]\n*[[Creaky voice]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*{{cite book| authorlink=Hans Basb\u00f8ll| last=Basb\u00f8ll| first=Hans| date=2005| title=The Phonology of Danish|publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0-19-824268-0|ref=harv}}\n* [[Nina Gr\u00f8nnum|Gr\u00f8nnum, Nina]] (2001).

{"title_page": "Mass communication", "text_new": "{{Cleanup|reason=the article contains some incessant paragraphs and inaccurate claims.|date=December 2019}}\n\n{{short description|Large-scale dissemination of information}}\n{{about|the academic field of study|the actual means of mass communication|Mass media}}\n\n'''Mass communication''' is the process of imparting and exchanging [[information]] through [[mass media]] to large segments of the population. It is usually understood for relating to various forms of media, as these technologies are used for the dissemination of information, of which [[journalism]] and [[advertising]] are part of. Mass communication differs from other forms of communication, such as [[interpersonal communication]] and [[organizational communication]], because it focuses on particular resources transmitting information to numerous receivers. The study of mass communication is chiefly concerned with how the content of mass communication persuades or otherwise affects the [[behavior]], the [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]], [[opinion]], or [[emotion]] of the people receiving the information.\n\nNormally, transmission of messages to many persons at a time is called mass communication. But in a complete sense, mass communication can be understood as the process of extensive circulation of information within regions and across the globe.\n\nThrough mass communication, information can be transmitted quickly to many people who generally stay far away from the sources of information. Mass communication is practiced multiple mediums, such as [[radio]], [[television]], [[social networking]], [[billboards]], [[newspapers]], [[magazines]], [[film]], and the [[Internet]].\n\n==Field of study==\nIn social science, mass communication is a sub-field of [[communication studies]]. Mass communication is \"the process by which a person, group of people, or organization creates a message and transmits it through some type of medium to a large, anonymous, heterogeneous audience.\"<ref>Pearce 2009, p. 624</ref> This implies that the audience of mass communication are mostly made up of different cultures, behavior, and [[belief system]]s. Mass communication is commonly associated with [[media studies]]. \n\nIn the United States, the study of mass communication is often associated with the practical applications of [[journalism]], [[television broadcasting|television]] and [[radio broadcasting]], [[film]], [[public relations]], or [[advertising]]. With the diversification of media forms, the study of mass communication has extended to include [[social media]] and [[new media]], which have stronger [[feedback]] models than traditional media sources.\n\nThe [[history of communication]] stretches from prehistoric forms of art and writing through modern communication methods such as the [[Internet]]. Mass communication began when humans could transmit messages from a single source to multiple receivers. Mass communication has moved from theories such as the [[hypodermic needle model]] (or magic bullet theory) through more modern theories such as [[computer-mediated communication]].\n\n== Types of mass communication ==\n=== Advertising ===\n\n{{Main|Advertising}}\n\n'''Advertising''', in relation to mass communication, is [[marketing]] a product or service in a persuasive manner that encourages the audience to buy the product or use the service. &nbsp;Because advertising generally takes place through some form of [[mass media]], such as [[television]], studying the effects and methods of advertising is relevant to the study of mass communication. Advertising is the paid, impersonal, one-way marketing of persuasive information from a sponsor. Through mass communication channels, the sponsor promotes the adoption of products or ideas. Advertisers have full control of the message being sent to their audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/Courses/ResourcesForCourses/Advertising/AdvertisingWhatIsIt.html|title=What is Advertising?|last1=Curtis|first1=Anthony|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Journalism ===\n\n{{Main|Journalism}}'''Journalism''', is the production and distribution of [[Report|reports]] on events for presentation through the media. &nbsp;The study of journalism involves analyzing the dissemination of information to the public through [[mass media|media outlets]] such as [[newspapers]], [[news channel]], [[radio station]], [[television station]], and more recently, [[e-readers]] and [[smartphones]].\n\n'''Alternative Journalism''' deviates from established or dominant types of media in terms of their content, production, or distribution. Alternative journalism utilizes the same media outlets as mainstream journalism, to advocate the \"interests of those excluded from the mainstream.\n\n'''Civic journalism''' (also known as public journalism) is the idea of integrating journalism into the democratic process. The media not only informs the public, but it also works towards engaging citizens and creating public debate.\n\n'''Citizen journalism''' is based upon public citizens actively producing news and information. Citizen journalism deals with the distribution of news by the public, often through the Internet.\n\n=== Public relations ===\n\n{{Main|Public relations}}'''Public relations''' is the process of providing information to the public in order to present a specific view of a product or [[organization]]. &nbsp;Public relations differs from advertising in that it is less obtrusive, and aimed at providing a more comprehensive opinion to a large audience in order to shape [[public opinion]]. Unlike advertising, public relations professionals only have control until the message is related to media gatekeepers who decide where to pass the information on to the audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/Courses/ResourcesForCourses/Advertising/AdvertisingWhatIsIt.html|title=What is Advertising?|last1=Curtis|first1=Anthony|accessdate=November 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Social media &nbsp;===\n\n{{Main|Social media}}\n\n'''Social media''', in its modern use, refers to platforms used on both mobile devices and home computers that allow users to interact through the use of words, images, sounds, and video.<ref name=\":0\" /> Social media includes popular sites such as Facebook and Instagram, as well as sites that can aid in business networking such as LinkedIn.The use and importance of social media in communications and public relations has grown drastically throughout the years and is now a staple in advertisements to mass audiences.

Despite the ever-growing popularity of moving images, the Lumiere Brothers did not seek to revolutionize the style of film, but stuck to documenting daily life in France.

[[Communication theory]] addresses the processes and mechanisms that allow communication to take place.\n\n*[[Cultivation theory]], developed by [[George Gerbner]] and [[Marshall McLuhan]], discusses the long-term effects of watching television, and hypothesizes that the more television an individual consumes, the more likely that person is to believe the real world is similar to what they have seen on television.<ref>Gerbner, G., Gross, L., Morgan, M., & Signorielli, N. (1986). \"Living with television: The dynamics of the cultivation process\" in J. Bryant & D. Zillman (Eds.), Perspectives on media effects (pp. 17\u201340) Hilldale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates</ref> Cultivation is closely related to the idea of the [[mean world syndrome]].\n*[[Agenda setting theory]] centers around the idea that media outlets tell the public \"not what to think, but what to think about.\" Agenda setting hypothesizes that media have the power to influence the public discourse, and tell people what are important issues facing society.<ref>McCombs, Maxwell E.; Donald L. Shaw (1972). \"The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media\". Public Opinion Quarterly 36 (2): 176</ref>\n*[[The spiral of silence]], developed by [[Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann]], hypothesizes that people are more likely to reveal their opinion in public if they believe that they are of the [[majority opinion]], for fear that revealing an unpopular opinion would subject them to being a social outcast. This theory is relevant to mass communication because it hypothesizes that mass media have the power to shape people's opinions, as well as relay the opinion that is believed to be the majority opinion.<ref>Noelle-Neumann, E. (1974). The spiral of silence: a theory of public opinion.

All sign systems, entitled to be \u201cread\u201d or interpreted, regardless of form, may be referred to as \u201ctexts.\u201d In the study of Semiotics, there is no such thing as a literal reading.<ref>Encyclopedia of Curriculum Studies</ref>\n\n==Methods of study==\n\nCommunication researchers study communication through various methods that have been verified through repetitive, cumulative processes. Both [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[qualitative research|qualitative]] methods have been used in the study of mass communication. The main focus of mass communication research is to learn how the content of mass communication affects the attitudes, opinions, emotions, and ultimately behaviors of the people who receive the message. Several prominent methods of study are as follows:<ref>Babbie, E. (2007). The practice of social research. Thomas Higher Education: Belmont, California. {{ISBN|0-495-09325-4}}</ref>\n\n*Studying cause and effect relationships in communication can only be done through an experiment. This quantitative method regularly involves exposing participants to various media content and recording their reactions. To show causation, mass communication researchers must isolate the variable they are studying, show that it occurs before the observed effect, and that it is the only variable that could cause the observed effect.\n*[[Survey methodology|Survey]], another quantitative method, involves asking individuals to respond to a set of questions in order to generalize their responses to a larger population.\n*[[Content analysis]] (sometimes known as textual analysis) refers to the process of identifying categorial properties of a piece of communication, such as a newspaper [[article (publishing)|article]], book, television program, film, or broadcast news script. This process allows researchers to see what the content of communication looks like.\n*A qualitative method known as [[ethnography]] allows a researcher to immerse themselves into a culture to observe and record the qualities of communication that exist there.\n\n==Professional organizations==\n\nThe [[Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aejmc.org|title=AEJMC|website=AEJMC}}</ref> is the major membership organization for academics in the field, offering regional and '''national conferences and refereed publications'''. The [[International Communication Association]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icahdq.org/|title=International Communication Association|website=www.icahdq.org}}</ref> and [[National Communication Association]] (formerly the Speech Communication Association) are also prominent professional organizations.

It is usually understood for relating to various forms of media, as these technologies are used for the dissemination of information, of which [[journalism]] and [[advertising]] are part of. Mass communication differs from other forms of communication, such as [[interpersonal communication]] and [[organizational communication]], because it focuses on particular resources transmitting information to numerous receivers. The study of mass communication is chiefly concerned with how the content of mass communication persuades or otherwise affects the [[behavior]], the [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]], [[opinion]], or [[emotion]] of the people receiving the information.\n\nNormally, transmission of messages to many persons at a time is called mass communication. But in a complete sense, mass communication can be understood as the process of extensive circulation of information within regions and across the globe.\n\nThrough mass communication, information can be transmitted quickly to many people who generally stay far away from the sources of information. Mass communication is practiced multiple mediums, such as [[radio]], [[television]], [[social networking]], [[billboards]], [[newspapers]], [[magazines]], [[film]], and the [[Internet]].\n\n==Field of study==\nIn social science, mass communication is a sub-field of [[communication studies]]. Mass communication is \"the process by which a person, group of people, or organization creates a message and transmits it through some type of medium to a large, anonymous, heterogeneous audience.\"<ref>Pearce 2009, p. 624</ref> This implies that the audience of mass communication are mostly made up of different cultures, behavior, and [[belief system]]s. Mass communication is commonly associated with [[media studies]]. \n\nIn the United States, the study of mass communication is often associated with the practical applications of [[journalism]], [[television broadcasting|television]] and [[radio broadcasting]], [[film]], [[public relations]], or [[advertising]]. With the diversification of media forms, the study of mass communication has extended to include [[social media]] and [[new media]], which have stronger [[feedback]] models than traditional media sources.\n\nThe [[history of communication]] stretches from prehistoric forms of art and writing through modern communication methods such as the [[Internet]]. Mass communication began when humans could transmit messages from a single source to multiple receivers. Mass communication has moved from theories such as the [[hypodermic needle model]] (or magic bullet theory) through more modern theories such as [[computer-mediated communication]].\n\n== Types of mass communication ==\n=== Advertising ===\n\n{{Main|Advertising}}\n\n'''Advertising''', in relation to mass communication, is [[marketing]] a product or service in a persuasive manner that encourages the audience to buy the product or use the service. &nbsp;Because advertising generally takes place through some form of [[mass media]], such as [[television]], studying the effects and methods of advertising is relevant to the study of mass communication. Advertising is the paid, impersonal, one-way marketing of persuasive information from a sponsor. Through mass communication channels, the sponsor promotes the adoption of products or ideas. Advertisers have full control of the message being sent to their audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/Courses/ResourcesForCourses/Advertising/AdvertisingWhatIsIt.html|title=What is Advertising?|last1=Curtis|first1=Anthony|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Journalism ===\n\n{{Main|Journalism}}'''Journalism''', is the production and distribution of [[Report|reports]] on events for presentation through the media. &nbsp;The study of journalism involves analyzing the dissemination of information to the public through [[mass media|media outlets]] such as [[newspapers]], [[news channel]], [[radio station]], [[television station]], and more recently, [[e-readers]] and [[smartphones]].\n\n'''Alternative Journalism''' deviates from established or dominant types of media in terms of their content, production, or distribution. Alternative journalism utilizes the same media outlets as mainstream journalism, to advocate the \"interests of those excluded from the mainstream.\n\n'''Civic journalism''' (also known as public journalism) is the idea of integrating journalism into the democratic process. The media not only informs the public, but it also works towards engaging citizens and creating public debate.\n\n'''Citizen journalism''' is based upon public citizens actively producing news and information. Citizen journalism deals with the distribution of news by the public, often through the Internet.\n\n=== Public relations ===\n\n{{Main|Public relations}}'''Public relations''' is the process of providing information to the public in order to present a specific view of a product or [[organization]]. &nbsp;Public relations differs from advertising in that it is less obtrusive, and aimed at providing a more comprehensive opinion to a large audience in order to shape [[public opinion]]. Unlike advertising, public relations professionals only have control until the message is related to media gatekeepers who decide where to pass the information on to the audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/Courses/ResourcesForCourses/Advertising/AdvertisingWhatIsIt.html|title=What is Advertising?|last1=Curtis|first1=Anthony|accessdate=November 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Social media &nbsp;===\n\n{{Main|Social media}}\n\n'''Social media''', in its modern use, refers to platforms used on both mobile devices and home computers that allow users to interact through the use of words, images, sounds, and video.<ref name=\":0\" /> Social media includes popular sites such as Facebook and Instagram, as well as sites that can aid in business networking such as LinkedIn.The use and importance of social media in communications and public relations has grown drastically throughout the years and is now a staple in advertisements to mass audiences. For many newer companies and businesses geared towards young people social media is a tool for advertising purposes and growing the brand. Social Media provides additional ways to connect and reach out to ones targeted audience.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Key Concepts in Public Relations|last=Franklin|first=Bob|last2=Hogan|first2=Mike|last3=Langley|first3=Quentin|last4=Mosdell|first4=Nick|last5=Pill|first5=Elliot|date=2009|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd|isbn=9781412923194|location=1 Oliver's Yard, &nbsp;55 City Road, &nbsp;London &nbsp; &nbsp;EC1Y 1SP &nbsp;United Kingdom|doi=10.4135/9781446269084|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/keyconceptsinpub0000unse}}</ref>\n\nThere are multiple social-networking sites that have the ability to visualize and share ones personal social life. Even though the first social networking sites were created several years ago, the rise of both [[Myspace|MySpace]] and [[Facebook]] took over and cancelled out the previous social media sites. Facebook has the ability for people to view your personal life with you posting picture, videos and updating your status. As of today, Facebook is one of the most popular social media websites for multiple types of communication. Generally, Facebook is used for communication with relatives and friends along with people who share interests.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Facebook as communication support for persons with potential mild acquired cognitive impairment: A content and social network analysis study.

The MTV reality show [[Catfish: The TV Show]] has brought mainstream attention to this issue.<ref name=\":0\" /> The goal of these episodes is to keep track of people who have fallen in love with someone they interacted with online, but never met in person.

Despite the ever-growing popularity of moving images, the Lumiere Brothers did not seek to revolutionize the style of film, but stuck to documenting daily life in France.

Public Opinion Quarterly 36 (2): 176</ref>\n*[[The spiral of silence]], developed by [[Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann]], hypothesizes that people are more likely to reveal their opinion in public if they believe that they are of the [[majority opinion]], for fear that revealing an unpopular opinion would subject them to being a social outcast. This theory is relevant to mass communication because it hypothesizes that mass media have the power to shape people's opinions, as well as relay the opinion that is believed to be the majority opinion.<ref>Noelle-Neumann, E.

All sign systems, entitled to be \u201cread\u201d or interpreted, regardless of form, may be referred to as \u201ctexts.\u201d In the study of Semiotics, there is no such thing as a literal reading.<ref>Encyclopedia of Curriculum Studies</ref>\n\n==Methods of study==\n\nCommunication researchers study communication through various methods that have been verified through repetitive, cumulative processes. Both [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[qualitative research|qualitative]] methods have been used in the study of mass communication. The main focus of mass communication research is to learn how the content of mass communication affects the attitudes, opinions, emotions, and ultimately behaviors of the people who receive the message. Several prominent methods of study are as follows:<ref>Babbie, E. (2007). The practice of social research. Thomas Higher Education: Belmont, California. {{ISBN|0-495-09325-4}}</ref>\n\n*Studying cause and effect relationships in communication can only be done through an experiment. This quantitative method regularly involves exposing participants to various media content and recording their reactions. To show causation, mass communication researchers must isolate the variable they are studying, show that it occurs before the observed effect, and that it is the only variable that could cause the observed effect.\n*[[Survey methodology|Survey]], another quantitative method, involves asking individuals to respond to a set of questions in order to generalize their responses to a larger population.\n*[[Content analysis]] (sometimes known as textual analysis) refers to the process of identifying categorial properties of a piece of communication, such as a newspaper [[article (publishing)|article]], book, television program, film, or broadcast news script. This process allows researchers to see what the content of communication looks like.\n*A qualitative method known as [[ethnography]] allows a researcher to immerse themselves into a culture to observe and record the qualities of communication that exist there.\n\n==Professional organizations==\n\nThe [[Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aejmc.org|title=AEJMC|website=AEJMC}}</ref> is the major membership organization for academics in the field, offering regional and '''national conferences and refereed publications'''. The [[International Communication Association]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icahdq.org/|title=International Communication Association|website=www.icahdq.org}}</ref> and [[National Communication Association]] (formerly the Speech Communication Association) are also prominent professional organizations. Each of these organizations publishes a different refereed academic journal that reflects the research that is being performed in the field of mass communication.\n\n==See also==\n<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n* [[Communication]]\n* [[Communication studies]]\n* [[Communication theory as a field]]\n* [[History of communication]]\n* [[Media influence]]\n* [[Media studies]]\n* [[Social science]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n* Pearce, K.J.

The popularity of billiards grew quickly, and by the late 1860s, the U.S. billiards market was dominated by Brunswick\u2019s firm and two others. In 1873 Brunswick merged with one of his competitors, Julius Balke\u2019s [[Cincinnati]]-based Great Western Billiard Manufactory, to form J.M. Brunswick & Balke Company. In 1884, the company merged with the other competitor, [[New York City|New York]]-based Phelan & Collender, to form the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company. (The company name was changed to Brunswick Corporation in 1960.) The company grew quickly and added new product lines to its business in the 1880s. Brunswick began selling functional and decorative wooden backs for bars. [[Prohibition]] prompted a drastic change in the products offered by the company. And while the [[Great Depression|Depression]] was a difficult period for Brunswick, [[World War II]] brought a great deal of new business. The company's billiard products were popular in the [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) centers.<ref name=\"Lehman\">{{cite web|title=Brunswick Corp.: List of Deals|work=Lehman Brothers Collection|publisher=Baker Library, Harvard Business School|url=http://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/lehman/company.html?company=brunswick_corp|accessdate=July 15, 2014}}</ref>\n\nMore than 13,000 billiards tables were installed at military bases by 1945.

In 1947 the company opened \"Cue and Cushion\" establishments, family-friendly billiards establishments that include a lounge and [[soda fountain]]. In 2003 the company opened its first \u201cHome & Billards Store\u201d in the [[Chicago]] area, and went on to open one other store in [[Boston]] and two in [[Denver]].

Bowlero has said it will operate the division as a stand-alone division. Brunswick centers offered bowling and, depending on size and location, in-house restaurants, [[taverns]], outdoor patios, billiards, video and [[Redemption game|redemption]] games, [[laser tag]], [[pro shop]]s and meeting and party rooms.

In 1966, still suffering from the decline, Brunswick closed many European bowling centers.<ref name=\"BrunsHist\"/>\n\nIn 2007 the company opened its first Brunswick Zone XL centers, large, smoke-free facilities aimed at families, [[bowling league]]s, parties, corporate meetings and group events, offering bowling, [[laser tag]], [[bumper cars]], [[video game]] arcades, Brunswick billiards tables, large screen TVs, and spacious meeting rooms.<ref name=\"BrunsHist\"/>\n\nDuring 2013 Brunswick Bowling divested its seven remaining European bowling centers.<ref name=\"10K2013\"/>\n\n===Brunswick Bowling Products===\n\n[[File:Brunswick Bowling.png|thumb|right|alt=Logo for Brunswick Bowling|Logo used for Brunswick bowling products]]\n\n[[File:International Bowling Museum and Hall of Fame April 2019 12 (Brunswick semi-automatic pinsetters).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Brunswick semi-automatic pinsetters|Brunswick semi-automatic pinsetters at the [[International Bowling Museum and Hall of Fame]]]]\n\nNow owned by BlueArc Capital Management of Atlanta, GA and its investor partners, the former Brunswick bowling equipment and products division designs, manufactures and markets a wide variety of bowling products. The company is now called Brunswick Bowling Products. \n\nThe division's products for bowling centers include capital equipment, such as Sync, the fastest-growing scoring and management system in the world, Spark, the industry's first and only immersive, interactive bowling experience,  automatic [[pinsetters]], [[bowling pins]], \"house\" bowling balls, ball returns, [[Bowling lane|lane surfaces]], and bowling center furniture, as well as [[Aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]] products such as [[pinsetter]] parts, lane conditioning machines, and conditioners and cleaners for lane machines. The company's current [[pinsetter]] model is in the GS Series but many A Series models remain in active service in bowling centers around the world. Similarly, many centers still use Brunswick AS-80, AS-90, Classic, Frameworx, Vector, and Vector Plus [[Automatic scorer|scoring systems]]. Brunswick lane surfaces include the Anvilane and Pro Lane brands.<ref name=\"10K2013\"/>\n\nThe division's consumer products include its [[bowling balls]] as well as, through licensing arrangements, bowling shoes, bags and accessories. Products are marketed under the Brunswick, DV8, Radical, and other brand names.\n\nProducts are manufactured or sourced mainly from facilities located in [[Michigan]] and [[Wisconsin]] in the United States, as well as in [[Hungary]] and [[Mexico]]. Bowling products are sold through a [[Direct selling|direct sales force]] or [[Distribution (business)|distributors]] in the United States and through distributors in non-U.S. markets.<ref name=\"FY2013fs\"/>\n\nBrunswick began production of wooden lanes, [[bowling balls]], and [[bowling pins]] in the 1880s as [[tavern]]s began to install [[bowling lane]]s. John Brunswick\u2019s son-in-law [[Moses Bensinger]], who was then directing Brunswick\u2019s day-to-day operations, actively promoted bowling as a participatory sport and was instrumental in organizing the [[American Bowling Congress]] in 1895.<ref name=\"BrunsHist\"/><ref name=\"FundUniv\">{{cite web|title=Brunswick Corporation History|publisher=Funding Universe|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/brunswick-corporation-history/|accessdate=July 15, 2014}}</ref>\n \nIn 1906 Bensinger opened a large manufacturing plant in [[Muskegon]], [[Michigan]]. The plant became the cornerstone of the firm's manufacturing, producing such products as the revolutionary $20 Mineralite (hard rubber) bowling ball, and grew to over one million square feet by the 1940s. During [[World War II]], [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) centers and military bases eagerly purchased bowling equipment, leading to more than 3,000 bowling lanes being installed at military bases by 1945.<ref name=\"BrunsHist\"/>\n\nAt the time, Brunswick manufactured \u201cspotting tables\u201d which were manually operated to place bowling pins in their proper places on a lane before a bowling ball was thrown at them. The company had toyed with the idea of an automatic [[pinsetter]] since 1911, when inventor Ernest Hedenskoog joined the company. Many of his patents provided the basis for the automatic pinsetter later introduced.<ref name=\"BrunsHist\"/>\n\nIt was not until the [[American Machine and Foundry|American Machine and Foundry Company]] (AMF) introduced the first fully automatic pinsetter in 1952 that Brunswick scrambled to get its own machine to market. In 1954 Brunswick formed the Brunswick-Murray Pinsetter Corporation with [[Murray Corporation of America]], a manufacturer of components for autos and aircraft. By the time Brunswick\u2019s \u201cModel A\u201d pinsetters were in full production in 1955, Brunswick had bought out Murray.<ref name=\"FundUniv\"/>\n\nBrunswick's policy of selling pinsetters on credit, suburban expansion, and an aggressive advertising campaign all combined to make bowling centers enormously popular in the late 1950s. By the mid-1960s, however, overexpansion led to a period of decline. Brunswick had begun assembling bowling equipment in [[Dublin]] in 1959, but it closed its Italian factory in 1966 and the Dublin facility in 1972. Then, in 1973, it entered into a manufacturing joint venture with Fuji Kikai-Hiroshima. In 2005 Brunswick moved its bowling ball production to [[Reynosa]], [[Mexico]], and in 2006 it closed the Muskegon plant.<ref name=\"FundUniv\"/>\n\nIn 1967 Brunswick introduced the [[automatic scorer]]. In 1984, Brunswick acquired the Schmid Company of Scherzenbach, [[Switzerland]], and with it the rights to manufacture and sell its GS pinsetter.<ref name=\"FundUniv\"/> The GS is Brunswick\u2019s current pinsetter series. The mechanical portion of the pinsetter was originally manufactured in the Brunswick plant located in [[Stockach]], [[Germany]]. In 1999 the mechanical manufacturing was relocated to [[Hungary]].<ref>{{cite web|title=GS-Series Pinsetter Operation and Service Manual, January 2001, Part number 47-902735-000|url=http://www.bwt-innovative-solutions.cba.pl/instrukcje/GS98%20operations.pdf|publisher=Brunswick|accessdate=2014-01-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201214238/http://www.bwt-innovative-solutions.cba.pl/instrukcje/GS98%20operations.pdf#|archive-date=2014-02-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.brunswickbowling.com/ Brunswick Bowling (Bowling Center Equipment)]\n* [http://www.bowlwithbrunswick.com/ Brunswick Consumer Bowling Products]\n* [http://www.brunswickbilliards.com/ Brunswick Billiards]\n{{Brunswick}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brunswick Bowling and Billiards}}\n[[Category:Ten-pin bowling equipment manufacturers]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Lake Forest, Illinois]]\n[[Category:Sporting goods manufacturers of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "'''Brunswick Bowling & Billiards''' was the business segment of [[Brunswick Corporation]] that historically encompassed the following three divisions:\n\n* [[#Billiards|Billiards]] (currently owned by [[KPS Capital Partners]])\n* [[#Bowling centers|Bowling centers]] (currently owned by [[Bowlero Corporation]], formerly known as Bowlmor AMF)\n* [[#Bowling equipment and products|Bowling equipment and products]] (currently owned by BlueArc Capital Management)\n\nBrunswick announced in July 2014 its intention to leave the bowling business by the end of 2014, retaining its heritage billiards business and reporting billiards financial results as part of the Fitness segment.

Bowlero has said it will operate the division as a stand-alone division. Brunswick centers offered bowling and, depending on size and location, in-house restaurants, [[taverns]], outdoor patios, billiards, video and [[Redemption game|redemption]] games, [[laser tag]], [[pro shop]]s and meeting and party rooms. The Brunswick bowling center brands were:<ref name=\"10K2013\"/><ref name=\"BJI\">{{cite news|title=New Brunswick\u2019s Targets Most Promising Consumer|newspaper=[[Bowlers Journal|Bowlers Journal International]]|date=July 2013}}</ref>\n\n* Brunswick's - A new, upscale concept featuring plush decor and mood lighting, innovative cuisine as well as traditional \"American pub fare,\" and a higher level of customer service.

In 1966, still suffering from the decline, Brunswick closed many European bowling centers.<ref name=\"BrunsHist\"/>\n\nIn 2007 the company opened its first Brunswick Zone XL centers, large, smoke-free facilities aimed at families, [[bowling league]]s, parties, corporate meetings and group events, offering bowling, [[laser tag]], [[bumper cars]], [[video game]] arcades, Brunswick billiards tables, large screen TVs, and spacious meeting rooms.<ref name=\"BrunsHist\"/>\n\nDuring 2013 Brunswick Bowling divested its seven remaining European bowling centers.<ref name=\"10K2013\"/>\n\n===Bowling equipment and products===\n\n[[File:Brunswick Bowling.png|thumb|right|alt=Logo for Brunswick Bowling|Logo used for Brunswick bowling products]]\n\n[[File:International Bowling Museum and Hall of Fame April 2019 12 (Brunswick semi-automatic pinsetters).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Brunswick semi-automatic pinsetters|Brunswick semi-automatic pinsetters at the [[International Bowling Museum and Hall of Fame]]]]\n\nNow owned by BlueArc Capital Management of Atlanta, GA and its investor partners, the former Brunswick bowling equipment and products division designs, manufactures and markets a wide variety of bowling products.\n\nThe division's products for bowling centers include capital equipment, such as automatic [[pinsetters]], [[bowling pins]], \"house\" bowling balls, ball returns, [[Bowling lane|lane surfaces]], [[Automatic scorer|scoring systems]], and bowling center furniture, as well as [[Aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]] products such as [[pinsetter]] parts, lane conditioning machines, and conditioners and cleaners for lane machines. The company's current [[pinsetter]] model is in the GS Series but many A Series models remain in active service in bowling centers around the world. Similarly, many centers still use Brunswick AS-80, AS-90, Classic, Frameworx, Vector, and Vector Plus [[Automatic scorer|scoring systems]] while the currently-offered system is Sync. Brunswick lane surfaces include the Anvilane and Pro Lane brands.<ref name=\"10K2013\"/>\n\nThe division's consumer products include its [[bowling balls]] as well as, through licensing arrangements, bowling shoes, bags and accessories. Products are marketed under the Brunswick, DV8, Radical, and other brand names.\n\nProducts are manufactured or sourced mainly from facilities located in [[Michigan]] and [[Wisconsin]] in the United States, as well as in [[Hungary]] and [[Mexico]]. Bowling products are sold through a [[Direct selling|direct sales force]] or [[Distribution (business)|distributors]] in the United States and through distributors in non-U.S. markets.<ref name=\"FY2013fs\"/>\n\nBrunswick began production of wooden lanes, [[bowling balls]], and [[bowling pins]] in the 1880s as [[tavern]]s began to install [[bowling lane]]s. John Brunswick\u2019s son-in-law [[Moses Bensinger]], who was then directing Brunswick\u2019s day-to-day operations, actively promoted bowling as a participatory sport and was instrumental in organizing the [[American Bowling Congress]] in 1895.<ref name=\"BrunsHist\"/><ref name=\"FundUniv\">{{cite web|title=Brunswick Corporation History|publisher=Funding Universe|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/brunswick-corporation-history/|accessdate=July 15, 2014}}</ref>\n \nIn 1906 Bensinger opened a large manufacturing plant in [[Muskegon]], [[Michigan]]. The plant became the cornerstone of the firm's manufacturing, producing such products as the revolutionary $20 Mineralite (hard rubber) bowling ball, and grew to over one million square feet by the 1940s. During [[World War II]], [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) centers and military bases eagerly purchased bowling equipment, leading to more than 3,000 bowling lanes being installed at military bases by 1945.<ref name=\"BrunsHist\"/>\n\nAt the time, Brunswick manufactured \u201cspotting tables\u201d which were manually operated to place bowling pins in their proper places on a lane before a bowling ball was thrown at them. The company had toyed with the idea of an automatic [[pinsetter]] since 1911, when inventor Ernest Hedenskoog joined the company. Many of his patents provided the basis for the automatic pinsetter later introduced.<ref name=\"BrunsHist\"/>\n\nIt was not until the [[American Machine and Foundry|American Machine and Foundry Company]] (AMF) introduced the first fully automatic pinsetter in 1952 that Brunswick scrambled to get its own machine to market. In 1954 Brunswick formed the Brunswick-Murray Pinsetter Corporation with [[Murray Corporation of America]], a manufacturer of components for autos and aircraft. By the time Brunswick\u2019s \u201cModel A\u201d pinsetters were in full production in 1955, Brunswick had bought out Murray.<ref name=\"FundUniv\"/>\n\nBrunswick's policy of selling pinsetters on credit, suburban expansion, and an aggressive advertising campaign all combined to make bowling centers enormously popular in the late 1950s. By the mid-1960s, however, overexpansion led to a period of decline. Brunswick had begun assembling bowling equipment in [[Dublin]] in 1959, but it closed its Italian factory in 1966 and the Dublin facility in 1972. Then, in 1973, it entered into a manufacturing joint venture with Fuji Kikai-Hiroshima. In 2005 Brunswick moved its bowling ball production to [[Reynosa]], [[Mexico]], and in 2006 it closed the Muskegon plant.<ref name=\"FundUniv\"/>\n\nIn 1967 Brunswick introduced the [[automatic scorer]]. In 1984, Brunswick acquired the Schmid Company of Scherzenbach, [[Switzerland]], and with it the rights to manufacture and sell its GS pinsetter.<ref name=\"FundUniv\"/> The GS is Brunswick\u2019s current pinsetter series. The mechanical portion of the pinsetter was originally manufactured in the Brunswick plant located in [[Stockach]], [[Germany]]. In 1999 the mechanical manufacturing was relocated to [[Hungary]].<ref>{{cite web|title=GS-Series Pinsetter Operation and Service Manual, January 2001, Part number 47-902735-000|url=http://www.bwt-innovative-solutions.cba.pl/instrukcje/GS98%20operations.pdf|publisher=Brunswick|accessdate=2014-01-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201214238/http://www.bwt-innovative-solutions.cba.pl/instrukcje/GS98%20operations.pdf#|archive-date=2014-02-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.brunswickbowling.com/ Brunswick Bowling (Bowling Center Equipment)]\n* [http://www.bowlwithbrunswick.com/ Brunswick Consumer Bowling Products]\n* [http://www.brunswickbilliards.com/ Brunswick Billiards]\n{{Brunswick}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brunswick Bowling and Billiards}}\n[[Category:Ten-pin bowling equipment manufacturers]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Lake Forest, Illinois]]\n[[Category:Sporting goods manufacturers of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Luchi.nelson", "label": "safe", "comment": "Updated the company name and product line.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunswick_Bowling_%26_Billiards"}

A smaller bridge from Far\u00f8 provides access to [[Bog\u00f8]] and thence to the island of [[M\u00f8n]]. \n\n==History==\nThe Far\u00f8 Bridges were opened by [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]] on 4 June 1985. They were built because of the increasing congestion problems on the old [[Storstr\u00f8m Bridge]] from 1937.\n\n==Design==\nThe high (south) bridge crosses [[Storstr\u00f8mmen]] between Falster and [[Far\u00f8]]. It is a [[cable-stayed bridge]]. The bridge is 1,726 metres long, the longest span is 290 metres, and the maximum clearance to the sea is 26 metres strung up on 95.14 meters high suspension towers, which was finished in 1984. It was one of the first cable-stayed bridge in [[Scandinavia]] (the first was the [[Str\u00f6msund Bridge]]). The two towers supporting the span are of 'diamond' shape construction, rising from a single point to either side of the roadway, then combining to one point above the centre of the bridge. There is only one row of suspension cables, along the centre of the roadway.\n\nThe low (north) bridge crosses [[Kalv\u00f8 Str\u00f8m]] between Far\u00f8 and Zealand. It is a [[beam bridge]]. The bridge is 1,596 metres long, the longest span is 40 metres, and the maximum clearance to the sea is 20 metres.\n\nThe construction was undertaken by a consortium of [[Vinci (construction)|Campenon Bernard]], [[MT H\u00f8jgaard|H\u00f8jgaard & Schultz]], [[Kampax]], [[MT H\u00f8jgaard|Monberg & Thorsen]] and [[Polensky & Z\u00f6llner]].<ref>{{Structurae|id=20000646|title=Far\u00f8 South bridge}}</ref><ref>{{Structurae|id=20004583|title=Far\u00f8 North bridge}}</ref>\n\n==Routes==\nThe Bridges carry the combined E47 route to Lolland and E55 route to Falster, from [[Copenhagen]] and [[Elsinore|Helsing\u00f8r]], both of which continue to mainland Europe by ferry.

It started off as a wall of protection for the guy, but now has turned into a solo fight by the girl to keep the relationship alive. The girl tries to maintain the relationship by communicating with him, but he doesn't listen to her. So she decides to end the relationship because he has no gratitude towards her for helping him with a previous emotional disaster. She questions if he is capable of feeling anything.

It started off as a wall of protection for the guy, but now has turned into a solo fight by the girl to keep the relationship alive. The girl tries to maintain the relationship by communicating with him, but he doesn't listen to her. So she decides to end the relationship because he has no gratitude towards her for helping him with a previous emotional disaster. She questions if he is capable of feeling anything.
