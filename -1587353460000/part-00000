{"title_page": "Command-line interface", "text_new": "{{short description|Type of computer interface based on entering text commands and viewing text output}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2012|cs1-dates=y}}\n[[File:Linux   [[Windows Vista]].]]\n\nA '''command-line interface''' ('''CLI''') processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text. The program which handles the interface is called a '''command-line interpreter''' or '''command-line processor'''. Operating systems implement a command-line interface in a [[shell (computing)|shell]] for interactive access to operating system functions or services. Such access was primarily provided to users by [[computer terminal]]s starting in the mid-1960s, and continued to be used throughout the 1970s and 1980s on [[OpenVMS|VAX/VMS]], [[Unix]] systems and personal computer systems including [[DOS]], [[CP/M]] and [[Apple DOS]].\n\nToday, users rely upon [[graphical user interface]]s and menu-driven interactions. However some programming and maintenance tasks may not have a graphical user interface and may still use a command line. \n\nAlternatives to the command line interface include [[text user interface]] [[menu (computing)|menus]] (for example, [[IBM AIX SMIT]]), [[keyboard shortcut]]s, and various [[desktop metaphor]]s centered on the [[pointer (graphical user interfaces)|pointer]] (usually controlled with a [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]). Examples of this include the Microsoft Windows, [[DOSSHELL|DosShell]], and Mouse Systems PowerPanel. Command line interfaces are often implemented in terminal devices that are also capable of screen-oriented text user interfaces that use cursor addressing to place symbols on a display screen.\n\nPrograms with command-line interfaces are generally easier to automate via [[scripting language|scripting]].\n\nMany software systems implement command line interfaces for control and operation. This includes programming environments and utility programs.\n\n==Comparison to graphical user interfaces==\n[[File:Gem_11_Desktop.png|thumb|250px|A graphical user interface with icons and windows ([[GEM (desktop environment)|GEM 1.1 Desktop]])]]\nCompared with a graphical user interface, a command line interface requires fewer system resources to implement. Since options to commands are given in a few characters in each command line, an experienced user may often find the options easier to access. Automation of repetitive tasks is simplified by line editing and history mechanisms for storing frequently used sequences; this may extend to a [[scripting language]] that can take parameters and variable options. A command-line history can be kept, allowing review or repetition of commands. \n \nA command-line system may require paper or online manuals for the user's reference, although often a \"help\" option provides a concise review of the options of a command. The command-line environment may not provide the graphical enhancements such as different [[Computer font|fonts]] or extended [[window (computing)|edit windows]] found in a GUI. It may be difficult for a new user to become familiar with all the commands and options available, compared with the [[icon (computing)|icons]] and [[drop-down menu]]s of a graphical user interface, without repeated reference to manuals.\n\n==Types==\n===Operating system command-line interfaces===\n[[File:Apple Unix with Netscape.png|thumb|250px|[[Apple Computer]]'s CommandShell in [[A/UX]] 3.0.1.]]\nOperating system (OS) command-line interfaces are usually distinct programs supplied with the operating system. A program that implements such a text interface is often called a command-line interpreter, command processor or [[shell (computing)|shell]]. \n\nExamples of command-line interpreters include [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC's]] [[DIGITAL Command Language]] (DCL) in [[OpenVMS]] and [[RSX-11]], the various [[Unix shell]]s ([[Bourne shell|sh]], [[KornShell|ksh]], [[C shell|csh]], [[tcsh]], [[Z shell|zsh]], [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], etc.), [[CP/M]]'s [[Console Command Processor|CCP]], [[DOS]]'s [[COMMAND.COM]], as well as the [[OS/2]] and the Windows [[CMD.EXE]] programs, the latter groups being based heavily on DEC's RSX-11 and [[RSTS/E|RSTS]] CLIs. Under most operating systems, it is possible to replace the default shell program with alternatives; examples include [[4DOS]] for DOS, [[4OS2]] for OS/2, and [[Take Command Console|4NT / Take Command]] for Windows.\n\nAlthough the term 'shell' is often used to describe a command-line interpreter, strictly speaking a 'shell' can be any program that constitutes the user-interface, including fully graphically oriented ones. For example, the default Windows GUI is a shell program named [[EXPLORER.EXE]], as defined in the SHELL=EXPLORER.EXE line in the WIN.INI configuration file. These programs are shells, but not CLIs.\n\n===Application command-line interfaces===\n[[File:GNUOctave430.png|thumb|250px|[[GNU Octave]]'s GUI with command-line interface]]\nApplication programs (as opposed to operating systems) may also have command line interfaces.\n\nAn application program may support none, any, or all of these three major types of command line interface mechanisms:\n\n* ''Parameters'': Most operating systems support a means to pass additional information to a program when it is launched. When a program is launched from an OS command line shell, additional text provided along with the program name is passed to the launched program.\n* ''Interactive command line sessions'': After launch, a program may provide an operator with an independent means to enter commands in the form of text.\n* ''Inter-process communication'': Most operating systems support means of [[inter-process communication]] (for example, [[standard streams]] or [[named pipe]]s). Command lines from client processes may be redirected to a CLI program by one of these methods.\n\nSome applications support only a CLI, presenting a CLI prompt to the user and acting upon command lines as they are entered. Other programs support both a CLI and a GUI. In some cases, a GUI is simply a [[Wrapper function|wrapper]] around a separate CLI [[executable file]]. In other cases, a program may provide a CLI as an optional alternative to its GUI. CLIs and GUIs often support different functionality. For example, all features of [[MATLAB]], a [[numerical analysis]] computer program, are available via the CLI, whereas the MATLAB GUI exposes only a subset of features.\n\nThe early Sierra games, such as the first three ''[[King's Quest]]'' games (1984\u20131986), used commands from an internal command line to move the character around in the graphic window.\n\n==History==\nThe command-line interface evolved from a form of dialog once conducted by humans over [[teleprinter]] (TTY) machines, in which human operators remotely exchanged information, usually one line of text at a time. Early computer systems often used teleprinter machines as the means of interaction with a human operator. The computer became one end of the human-to-human teleprinter model. So instead of a human communicating with another human over a teleprinter, a human communicated with a computer.\n\nThe mechanical teleprinter was replaced by a [[dumb terminal#Early VDUs|\"glass tty\"]], a keyboard and screen emulating the teleprinter. [[computer terminal#.22Intelligent.22 terminals|\"Smart\" terminal]]s permitted additional functions, such as cursor movement over the entire screen, or local editing of data on the terminal for transmission to the computer. As the [[microcomputer revolution]] replaced the traditional{{snd}}minicomputer + terminals{{snd}}[[time sharing]] architecture, hardware terminals were replaced by [[terminal emulator]]s&nbsp;\u2014 PC software that interpreted terminal signals sent through the PC's [[serial port]]s. These were typically used to interface an organization's new PC's with their existing mini- or mainframe computers, or to connect PC to PC. Some of these PCs were running [[Bulletin Board System]] software.\n\nEarly operating system CLIs were implemented as part of [[resident monitor]] programs, and could not easily be replaced. The first implementation of the shell as a replaceable component was part of the [[Multics]] [[time-sharing]] [[operating system]].<ref name=\"Unix_Shells\"/> In 1964, [[MIT Computation Center]] staff member [[Louis Pouzin]] developed the [[RUNCOM]] tool for executing command scripts while allowing argument substitution.<ref name=\"multicians\"/> Pouzin coined the term \"[[shell (computing)|shell]]\" to describe the technique of using commands like a programming language, and wrote a paper about how to implement the idea in the [[Multics]] operating system.<ref name=\"Metz_2013\"/> Pouzin returned to his native France in 1965, and the first Multics shell was developed by [[Glenda Schroeder]].<ref name=\"multicians\"/>\n\n[[File:Version 7 UNIX SIMH PDP11 Kernels Shell.png|thumb|250px|[[Bourne shell]] interaction on [[Version 7 Unix]]]]\nThe first [[Unix shell]], the [[Thompson shell|V6 shell]], was developed by [[Ken Thompson]] in 1971 at [[Bell Labs]] and was modeled after Schroeder's Multics shell.<ref name=\"Mazieres_2004\"/><ref name=\"ibm\"/> The [[Bourne shell]] was introduced in 1977 as a replacement for the V6 shell. Although it is used as an interactive command interpreter, it was also intended as a scripting language and contains most of the features that are commonly considered to produce structured programs. The Bourne shell led to the development of the [[Korn shell]] (ksh), [[Almquist shell]] (ash), and the popular [[Bourne-again shell]] (or Bash).<ref name=\"ibm\"/>\n\nEarly microcomputers themselves were based on a command-line interface such as [[CP/M]], [[DOS]] or [[AppleSoft BASIC]]. During the 1980s and 1990s, the introduction of the [[Apple Macintosh]] and of [[Microsoft Windows]] on PCs saw the command line interface as the primary user interface replaced by the [[Graphical User Interface]]. The command line remained available as an alternative user interface, often used by [[System Administrator|system administrators]] and other advanced users for system administration, [[computer programming]] and [[batch processing]].\n\nIn November 2006, [[Microsoft]] released version 1.0 of [[Windows PowerShell]] (formerly codenamed ''Monad''), which combined features of traditional Unix shells with their proprietary object-oriented [[.NET Framework]]. [[MinGW]] and [[Cygwin]] are [[open-source software|open-source]] packages for Windows that offer a Unix-like CLI. Microsoft provides [[MKS Inc.]]'s [[Korn shell|ksh]] implementation ''MKS Korn shell'' for Windows through their [[Windows Services for UNIX|Services for UNIX]] add-on.\n\nSince 2001, the [[Macintosh]] operating system [[macOS]] has been based on a [[Unix-like]] operating system called [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]. On these computers, users can access a Unix-like command-line interface by running the [[terminal emulator]] program called [[Terminal (macOS)|Terminal]], which is found in the Utilities sub-folder of the Applications folder, or by remotely logging into the machine using [[ssh]]. [[Z shell]] is the default shell for macOS; [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], [[tcsh]], and the [[Korn shell]] are also provided. Before [[macOS Catalina]], bash was the default.\n\n==Usage==  \n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}\nA CLI is used whenever a large vocabulary of commands or queries, coupled with a wide (or arbitrary) range of options, can be entered more rapidly as text than with a pure GUI. This is typically the case with [[operating system shell<!-- please, see [[talk:Shell (computing)]] before the link back -->|operating   are also used by systems with insufficient resources to support a graphical user interface.  Some computer language systems (such as<ref></ref> [[Python (p{{<ref></ref>}}rogramming language)|Python]], [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]], [[LISP]], [[Rexx]], and many<ref></ref> dialects of [[BASIC]]) provide an interactive command-line mode to allow for rapid evaluation of code.\n\nCLIs are often used by programmers and system administrators, in engineering and scientific environments, and by technically advanced personal computer users. CLIs are also popular among people with visual disabilities, since the commands and responses can be displayed using [[refreshable Braille display]]s.\n\n==Anatomy of a shell CLI==\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe general pattern of an OS command line interface<ref name=\"Bash\"/><ref name=\"Microsoft_Windows\"/> is:\n\n [[#Command prompt|Prompt]] command param1 param2 param3 \u2026 paramN\n\n* [[#Command prompt|Prompt]] \u2014 generated by the program to provide context for the client.\n* Command&nbsp;\u2014 provided by the client.  Commands are usually one of three classes:\n*# Internal&nbsp;\u2014 recognized and processed by the command line interpreter itself and not dependent upon any external executable file.\n*# Included&nbsp;\u2014 A separate executable file generally considered part of the operating environment and always included with the OS.\n*# External&nbsp;\u2014 External executable files not part of the basic OS, but added by other parties for specific purposes and applications.\n* param1 \u2026paramN&nbsp;\u2014 Optional parameters provided by the client.  The format and meaning of the parameters depends upon the command issued. In the case of Included or External commands, the values of the parameters are delivered to the program (specified by the Command) as it is launched by the OS.  Parameters may be either [[Argument (computer science)#Parameters and arguments|Arguments]] or [[Command-line option|Options]].\n\nIn this example, the delimiters between command line elements are [[whitespace character]]s and the end-of-line delimiter is the [[newline]] delimiter. This is a widely used (but not universal) convention for command-line interfaces.\n\n<!-- Above is more 'anatomy' and below is a bit mote theory and background and higher level concepts. Maybe separate sections for both? -->\nA CLI can generally be considered as consisting of [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] and [[semantics]]. The ''syntax'' is the grammar that all commands must follow. In the case of [[operating system]]s, [[DOS]] and [[Unix]] each define their own set of rules that all commands must follow. In the case of [[embedded systems]], each vendor, such as [[Nortel]], [[Juniper Networks]] or [[Cisco Systems]], defines their own proprietary set of rules that all commands within their CLI conform to. These rules also dictate how a user navigates through the system of commands. The ''semantics'' define what sort of operations are possible, on what sort of data these operations can be performed, and how the grammar represents these operations and data\u2014the symbolic meaning in the syntax.\n\nTwo different CLIs may agree on either syntax or semantics, but it is only when they agree on both that they can be considered sufficiently similar to allow users to use both CLIs without needing to learn anything, as well as to enable re-use of scripts.\n\nA simple CLI will display a prompt, accept a \"command line\" typed by the user terminated by the [[Enter key]], then execute the specified command and provide textual display of results or error messages.  Advanced CLIs will validate, interpret and parameter-expand the command line before executing the specified command, and optionally capture or redirect its output.\n\nUnlike a button or menu item in a GUI, a command line is typically self-documenting, stating exactly what the user wants done.  In addition, command lines usually include many [[Default (computer science)|default]]s that can be changed to customize the results.  Useful command lines can be saved by assigning a [[character string]] or [[alias (command)|alias]] to represent the full command, or several commands can be grouped to perform a more complex sequence&nbsp;\u2013 for instance, compile the program, install it, and run it&nbsp;\u2014 creating a single entity, called a command procedure or script which itself can be treated as a command. These advantages mean that a user must figure out a complex command or series of commands only once, because they can be saved, to be used again.\n\nThe commands given to a CLI shell are often in one of the following forms:\n\n* {{kbd|doSomething how toFiles}}\n* {{kbd|doSomething how sourceFile destinationFile}}\n* {{kbd|doSomething how < inputFile > outputFile}}\n* {{kbd|doSomething how {{!}} doSomething how {{!}} doSomething how > outputFile}}\n\nwhere ''doSomething'' is, in effect, a [[verb]], ''how'' an [[adverb]] (for example, should the command be executed \"verbosely\" or \"quietly\") and ''toFiles'' an object or objects (typically one or more files) on which the command should act. The <code>&gt;</code> in the third example is a [[redirection operator]], telling the command-line interpreter to send the output of the command not to its own standard output (the screen) but to the named file. This will overwrite the file. Using <code>&gt;&gt;</code> will redirect the output and append it to the file. Another redirection operator is the [[vertical bar]] (<code>|</code>), which creates a [[pipeline (Unix)|pipeline]] where the output of one command becomes the input to the next command.\n\n===CLI and resource protection===\nOne can modify the set of available commands by modifying which paths appear in the [[PATH (variable)|PATH]] environment variable. Under Unix, commands also need be marked as [[executable]] files. The directories in the path variable are searched in the order they are given. By re-ordering the path, one can run e.g. \\OS2\\MDOS\\E.EXE instead of \\OS2\\E.EXE, when the default is the opposite. Renaming of the executables also works: people often rename their favourite editor to EDIT, for example.\n\nThe command line allows one to restrict available commands, such as access to advanced internal commands.  The Windows [[CMD.EXE]] does this. Often, shareware programs will limit the range of commands, including printing a command 'your administrator has disabled running batch files' from the prompt.\n\nSome CLIs, such as those in [[network router]]s, have a hierarchy of [[mode (user interface)|mode]]s, with a different set of commands supported in each mode. The set of commands are grouped by association with security, system, interface, etc. In these systems the user might traverse through a series of sub-modes. For example, if the CLI had two modes called ''interface'' and ''system'', the user might use the command ''interface'' to enter the interface mode. At this point, commands from the system mode may not be accessible until the user exits the interface mode and enters the system mode.\n\n===Command prompt===\n[[File:Hard reset BBC Micro 32K Acorn DFS.gif|thumb|Prompt of a [[BBC Micro]] after switch-on or hard reset.]]\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Z shell]], [[Prompt]] and [[Abort, Retry, Fail]] -->\n{{Redirect|Command prompt|the Windows component named Command Prompt|cmd.exe}}\nA command prompt (or just ''prompt'') is a sequence of (one or more) characters used in a command-line interface to indicate readiness to accept commands.  It literally [[Wiktionary:prompt|prompt]]s the user to take action. A prompt usually ends with one of the characters <code>$</code>, <code>%</code>, <code>#</code>,<ref name=\"DR_1978_SID\"/><ref name=\"DR_1982_SID86\"/> <code>:</code>, <code>&gt;</code> or <code>-</code><!-- DOS DEBUG --><ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> and often includes other information, such as the path of the current [[working directory]] and the [[hostname]].\n\nOn many [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like|derivative systems]], the prompt commonly ends in  <code>$</code> or <code>%</code> if the user is a normal user, but in <code>#</code> if the user is a [[superuser]] (\"root\" in Unix terminology).\n\nEnd-users can often modify prompts. Depending on the environment, they may include colors, special characters, and other elements (like variables and functions for the current time, user, shell number or working directory) in order, for instance, to make the prompt more informative or visually pleasing, to distinguish sessions on various machines, or to indicate the current level of nesting of commands. On some systems, special tokens in the definition of the prompt can be used to cause external programs to be called by the command-line interpreter while displaying the prompt.\n\nIn DOS's COMMAND.COM and in Windows NT's [[cmd.exe]] users can modify the prompt by issuing a <code>PROMPT</code> command or by directly changing the value of the corresponding <code>[[%PROMPT%]]</code> [[environment variable]]. The default of most modern systems, the <code>C:\\></code> style is obtained, for instance, with <code>PROMPT $P$G</code>. The default of older DOS systems, <code>C></code> is obtained by just <code>PROMPT</code>, although on some systems this produces the newer <code>C:\\></code> style, unless used on floppy drives A: or B:; on those systems <code>PROMPT $N$G</code> can be used to override the automatic default and explicitly switch to the older style.\n\nMany Unix systems feature the <code>$PS1</code> variable (Prompt String 1),<ref name=\"Parker_2011\"/> although other variables also may affect the prompt (depending on the [[Unix shell|shell]] used). In the [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]] shell, a prompt of the form:\n\n<source lang=\"bash\">[time] user@host: work_dir $</source>\ncould be set by issuing the command\n<source lang=\"bash\">export PS1='[\\t] \\u@\\H: \\W $'</source>\n\nIn [[zsh]] the <code>$RPROMPT</code> variable controls an optional \"prompt\" on the right-hand side of the display. It is not a real prompt in that the location of text entry does not change. It is used to display information on the same line as the prompt, but right-justified.\n\nIn [[RISC OS]] the command prompt is a <code>*</code> symbol, and thus (OS)CLI commands are often referred to as \"star commands\".<ref name=\"Acorn_1992\"/> One can also access the same commands from other command lines (such as the [[BBC BASIC]] command line), by preceding the command with a <code>*</code>.\n\n==={{anchor|Arguments_section}}Arguments===\n[[File:COMMAND LINE.svg|thumb|right|An MS-DOS command line, illustrating parsing into command and arguments]]\nA '''command-line argument''' or '''[[Parameter#Computing|parameter]]''' is an item of information provided to a program when it is started.  A program can have many command-line arguments that identify sources or destinations of information, or that alter the operation of the program.\n\nWhen a command processor is active a program is typically invoked by typing its name followed by command-line arguments (if any). For example, in [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] environments, an example of a command-line argument is:\n\n<source lang=\"bash\">\nrm file.s\n</source>\n\n\"file.s\" is a command-line argument which tells the program [[rm (Unix)|rm]] to remove the file \"file.s\".\n\nSome programming languages, such as [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], allow a program to interpret the command-line arguments by handling them as string parameters in the [[Main function (programming)|main function]]. Other languages, such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], expose operating system specific [[Application programming interface|API]] (functionality) through <code>sys</code> [[Modular programming|module]], and in particular <code>sys.argv</code> for \"command-line arguments\".\n\nIn [[Unix-like operating system]]s, a single hyphen used in place of a file name is a special value specifying that a program should handle data coming from the [[standard input]] or send data to the [[standard output]].\n\n===={{anchor|SwitChar}}Command-line option====\n<!-- This section is linked from several places inside or outside this article, preferable by \"#SwitChar\". Do not remove or rename this section heading without also updating the links. -->\nA '''command-line option''' or simply '''option''' (also known as a '''flag''' or '''switch''') modifies the operation of a command; the effect is determined by the command's program. Options follow the command name on the command line, separated by spaces. A space before the first option is not always required, such as <code>Dir/?</code> and <code style=\"white-space:nowrap\">DIR /?</code> in DOS, which have the same effect<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> of listing the DIR command's available options, whereas <code>dir --help</code> (in many versions of Unix) ''does'' require the option to be preceded by at least one space (and is case-sensitive).\n\nThe format of options varies widely between operating systems. In most cases the syntax is by convention rather than an operating system requirement; the entire command line is simply a string passed to a program, which can process it in any way the programmer wants, so long as the interpreter can tell where the command name ends and its arguments and options begin.\n\nA few representative samples of command-line options, all relating to listing files in a directory, to illustrate some conventions:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Operating system !! Command !! Valid alternative !! Notes\n|-\n| [[OpenVMS]] || <code>directory/owner</code> || <code>Dir /Owner</code> || instruct the ''directory'' command to also display the ownership of the files.<br><small>''Note the Directory command name is not case sensitive, and can be abbreviated to as few letters as required to remain unique.''</small>\n|-\n| Windows || <code>DIR/Q/O:S d*</code> || <code>dir /q d* /o:s</code> || display ownership of files whose names begin with \"D\", sorted by size, smallest first.<br><small>''Note spaces around argument d* are required.''</small>\n|-\n| [[Unix-like]] systems || <code>ls -lS D*</code> || <code>ls -S -l D*</code> || display in long format files and directories beginning with \"D\" (but not \"d\"), sorted by size (largest first).<br><small>''Note spaces are required around all arguments and options, but some can be run together, e.g. '''-lS''' is the same as '''-l -S'''.''</small>\n|-\n| [[Data General RDOS]] [[Data General RDOS#RDOS CLI|CLI]]|| <code>list/e/s 04-26-80/b</code> || <code>List /S/E 4-26-80/B</code> || list every attribute for files created before 26 April 1980.<br><small>''Note the /B at the end of the date argument is a '''local switch''', that modifies the meaning of that argument, while /S and /E are '''global switches''', i.e. apply to the whole command.''</small>\n|}\n\n=====Abbreviating commands=====\n{{See also|Tab completion}}\nIn [[Multics]], command-line options and subsystem keywords may be abbreviated. This idea appears to derive from the [[PL/I programming language]], with its shortened keywords (e.g., STRG for STRINGRANGE and DCL for DECLARE). For example, in the Multics \"forum\" subsystem, the ''-long_subject'' parameter can be abbreviated ''-lgsj''. It is also common for Multics commands to be abbreviated, typically corresponding to the initial letters of the words that are strung together with underscores to form command names, such as the use of ''did'' for ''delete_iacl_dir''.\n\nIn some other systems abbreviations are automatic, such as permitting enough of the first characters of a command name to uniquely identify it (such as <code>SU</code> as an abbreviation for <code>SUPERUSER</code>) while others may have some specific abbreviations pre-programmed (e.g. <code>MD</code> for <code>[[MKDIR]]</code> in COMMAND.COM) or user-defined via batch scripts and aliases (e.g. <code>alias md mkdir</code> in [[tcsh]]).\n\n=====Option conventions in DOS, Windows, OS/2=====\nOn DOS, OS/2 and Windows, different programs called from their COMMAND.COM or CMD.EXE (or internal their commands) may use different syntax within the same operating system. For example:\n\n* Options may be indicated by either of the \"switch characters\": <code>/</code>, <code>-</code>, or either may be allowed. See below.\n* They may or may not be [[case-sensitive]].\n* Sometimes options and their arguments are run together, sometimes separated by whitespace, and sometimes by a character, typically <code>:</code> or <code>=</code>; thus <code>Prog -fFilename</code>, <code>Prog -f Filename</code>, <code>Prog -f:Filename</code>, <code>Prog -f=Filename</code>.\n* Some programs allow single-character options to be combined;<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> others do not. The switch <code>-fA</code> may mean the same as <code>-f -A</code>,<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> or it may be incorrect, or it may even be a valid but different parameter.\n\nIn [[DOS]], [[OS/2]] and [[Windows]], the forward slash (<code>/</code>) is most prevalent, although the hyphen-minus is also sometimes used. In many versions of DOS (MS-DOS/PC&nbsp;DOS 2.xx and higher, all versions of [[DR-DOS]] since 5.0, as well as [[PTS-DOS]], [[Embedded DOS]], [[FreeDOS]] and [[RxDOS]]) the '''switch character''' (sometimes abbreviated '''switchar''' or '''switchchar''') to be used is defined by a value returned from a [[system call]] ([[INT&nbsp;21h]]/AH=37h). The default character returned by this API is <code>/</code>, but can be changed to a hyphen-minus on the above-mentioned systems, except for under Datalight ROM-DOS and MS-DOS/PC&nbsp;DOS 5.0 and higher, which always return <code>/</code> from this call (unless one of many available [[Terminate & Stay Resident|TSR]]s to reenable the SwitChar feature is loaded). In some of these systems (MS-DOS/PC&nbsp;DOS 2.xx, DOS Plus 2.1, DR-DOS 7.02 and higher, PTS-DOS, Embedded DOS, FreeDOS and RxDOS), the setting can also be pre-configured by a [[SWITCHAR (CONFIG.SYS directive)|SWITCHAR]] directive in [[CONFIG.SYS]]. General Software's Embedded DOS provides a SWITCH command for the same purpose, whereas [[4DOS]] allows the setting to be changed via <code>SETDOS /W:n</code>.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> Under DR-DOS, if the setting has been changed from <code>/</code>, the first directory separator <code>\\</code> in the display of the [[PROMPT (DOS command)|PROMPT]] parameter <code>$G</code> will change to a forward slash <code>/</code> (which is also a valid directory separator in DOS, FlexOS, 4680 OS, 4690 OS, OS/2 and Windows) thereby serving as a visual clue to indicate the change.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> Also, the current setting is reflected also in the built-in help screens.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> Some versions of DR-DOS [[COMMAND.COM]]<!-- 7.07 --> also support a PROMPT token <code>$/</code> to display the current setting. COMMAND.COM since DR-DOS 7.02 also provides a [[pseudo-environment variable]] named <code>[[%/%]]</code> to allow portable batchjobs to be written.<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_DELTREE101\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_1998_NEW703\"/> Several external DR-DOS commands<!-- f.e. SYS in DR-DOS 7.07 --> additionally support an [[environment variable]] <code>[[%SWITCHAR%]]</code> to override the system setting.\n\nHowever, many programs are hardwired to use <code>/</code> only, rather than retrieving the switch setting before parsing command-line arguments. A very small number, mainly ports from Unix-like systems, are programmed to accept \"-\" even if the switch character is not set to it (for example <code>[[netstat]]</code> and <code>[[ping (networking utility)|ping]]</code>, supplied with [[Microsoft Windows]], will accept the /? option to list available options, and yet the list will specify the \"-\" convention).\n\n=====Option conventions in Unix-like systems=====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}\nIn [[Unix-like]] systems, the ASCII [[hyphen-minus]] begins options; the new (and [[GNU]]) convention is to use ''two'' hyphens then a word (e.g. <code>--create</code>) to identify the option's use while the old convention (and still available as an option for frequently-used options) is to use one hyphen then one letter (e.g., <code>-c</code>); if one hyphen is followed by two or more letters it may mean two options are being specified, or it may mean the second and subsequent letters are a parameter (such as filename or date) for the first option.\n\nTwo hyphen-minus characters without following letters (<code>--</code>) may indicate that the remaining arguments should not be treated as options, which is useful for example if a file name itself begins with a hyphen, or if further arguments are meant for an inner command (e.g., [[sudo]]). Double hyphen-minuses are also sometimes used to prefix \"long options\" where more descriptive option names are used. This is a common feature of [[GNU]] software. The ''[[getopt]]'' function and program, and the ''[[getopts]]'' command are usually used for parsing command-line options.\n\nUnix command names, arguments and options are case-sensitive (except in a few examples, mainly where popular commands from other operating systems have been ported to Unix).\n\n=====Option conventions in other systems=====\n[[FlexOS]], [[IBM 4680 OS|4680 OS]] and [[IBM 4690 OS|4690 OS]] use <code>-</code>.\n\n[[CP/M]] typically used <code><nowiki>[</nowiki></code>.\n\n[[Conversational Monitor System]] (CMS) uses a single [[Bracket#Parentheses .28 .29|left parenthesis]] to separate options at the end of the command from the other arguments.  For example, in the following command the options indicate that the target file should be replaced if it exists, and the date and time of the source file should be retained on the copy:\n<code>COPY source file a target file b (REPLACE OLDDATE</code>\n\n[[Data General]]'s CLI under their [[Data General RDOS|RDOS]], [[Data General AOS|AOS]], etc. operating systems, as well as the version of CLI that came with their [[Business Basic]], uses only <code>/</code> as the switch character, is case-insensitive, and allows \"local switches\" on some arguments to control the way they are interpreted, such as <code>MAC/U LIB/S A B C $LPT/L</code> has the global option \"U\" to the macro assembler command to append user symbols, but two local switches, one to specify LIB should be skipped on pass 2 and the other to direct listing to the printer, $LPT.\n\n===Built-in usage help===\n{{see also|help (command)}}\nOne of the criticisms of a CLI is the lack of cues to the user as to the available actions.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  In contrast, GUIs usually inform the user of available actions with menus, icons, or other visual cues.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} To overcome this limitation, many CLI programs display a brief summary of its valid parameters, typically when invoked with no arguments or one of <code>?</code>, <code>-?</code>, <code>-h</code>, <code>-H</code>, <code>/?</code>, <code>/h</code>, <code>/H</code>, <code>/Help</code>, <code>-help</code>, or <code>--help</code>.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_CPI\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_DEBUG\"/>  \n\nHowever, entering a program name without parameters in the hope that it will display usage help can be hazardous, as programs and scripts for which command line arguments are optional will execute without further notice.\n\nAlthough desirable at least for the help parameter, programs may not support all option lead-in characters exemplified above.\nUnder DOS, where the default [[Command-line_interface#Option_conventions_in_DOS.2C_Windows.2C_OS.2F2|command-line option character]] can be changed from <code>/</code> to <code>-</code>, programs may query the [[SwitChar]] API in order to determine the current setting. So, if a program is not hardwired to support them all, a user may need to know the current setting even to be able to reliably request help.\nIf the SwitChar has been changed to <code>-</code> and therefore the <code>/</code> character is accepted as alternative path delimiter also at the DOS command line, programs may misinterpret options like <code>/h</code> or <code>/H</code> as paths rather than help parameters.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> However, if given as first or only parameter, most DOS programs will, by convention<!-- at least in all versions of DR-DOS as well as under 4DOS and NDOS -->, accept it as request for help regardless of the current SwitChar setting.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/>\n\nIn some cases, different levels of help can be selected for a program. Some programs supporting this allow to give a verbosity level as an optional argument to the help parameter (as in <code>/H:1</code>, <code>/H:2</code>, etc.) or they give just a short help on help parameters with question mark and a longer help screen for the other help options.<ref name=\"Paul_2006_FreeKEYB\"/>\n\nDepending on the program, additional or more specific help on accepted parameters is sometimes available by either providing the parameter in question as an argument to the help parameter or vice versa (as in <code>/H:W</code> or in <code>/W:?</code> (assuming <code>/W</code> would be another parameter supported by the program)).<ref name=\"CCI_1997_HELP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_DRDOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_DEBUG\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_CPI\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2006_FreeKEYB\"/><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB1\"/>\n\nIn a similar fashion to the help parameter, but much less common, some programs provide additional information about themselves (like mode, status, version, author, license or contact information) when invoked with an \"about\" parameter like <code>-!</code>, <code>/!</code>, <code>-about</code>, or <code>--about</code>.<ref name=\"Paul_2002_CPI\"/>\n\nSince the <code>?</code> and <code>!</code> characters typically also serve other purposes at the command line, they may not be available in all scenarios, therefore, they should not be the only options to access the corresponding help information.\n\n[[File:RT-11 help.jpg|thumb|The end of the <tt>HELP</tt> command output from [[:en:RT-11|RT-11SJ]] displayed on a [[:en:VT100|VT100]].]]\nIf more detailed help is necessary than provided by a program's built-in internal help, many systems support a dedicated external \"<code>[[help (command)|help]] ''command''</code>\" command (or similar), which accepts a command name as calling parameter and will invoke an external help system.\n\nIn the DR-DOS family, typing <code>/?</code> or <code>/H</code> at the [[COMMAND.COM]] prompt instead of a command itself will display a dynamically generated list of available internal commands;<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> [[4DOS]] and [[NDOS]] support the same feature by typing <code>?</code> at the prompt<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> (which is also accepted by newer versions<!-- only 7.02 and higher --> of DR-DOS COMMAND.COM); internal commands can be individually disabled or reenabled via <code>SETDOS /I</code>.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> In addition to this, some newer versions of DR-DOS COMMAND.COM<!-- 7.07 --> also accept a <code>?%</code> command to display a list of available built-in [[DR-DOS system information variable|pseudo-environment variable]]s. Besides their purpose as quick help reference this can be used in batchjobs to query the facilities of the underlying command-line processor.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/>\n\n===Command description syntax===\nBuilt-in usage help and [[man page]]s commonly employ a small syntax to describe the valid command form:<ref name=\"OpenGroup_2008\"/><ref name=\"Microsoft_2005_Shell\"/><ref name=\"Microsoft_2010_Syntax\"/><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB2\"/>\n\n* angle brackets for ''required'' parameters: <code>ping <hostname></code>\n* square brackets for ''optional'' parameters: <code>mkdir [-p] <dirname></code>\n* ellipses for ''repeated'' items: <code>cp <source1> [source2\u2026] <dest></code>\n* vertical bars for ''choice'' of items: <code>netstat {-t|-u}</code>\n\nNotice that these characters have different meanings than when used directly in the shell. Angle brackets may be omitted when confusing the parameter name with a literal string is not likely.\n\n===The space character===\n<!-- this is a file-system feature, nothing to do with the command line -->\nIn many areas of computing, but particularly in the command line, the [[space character]] can cause problems as it has two distinct and incompatible functions: as part of a command or parameter, or as a parameter or name [[Delimiter|separator]]. Ambiguity can be prevented either by prohibiting embedded spaces in file and directory names in the first place (for example, by substituting them with [[underscores]] <code>_</code>), or by enclosing a name with embedded spaces between quote characters or using an [[escape character]] before the space, usually a [[backslash]] (<code>\\</code>).  For example\n:<code>Long path/Long program name Parameter one Parameter two</code> \u2026\nis ambiguous (is \"program name\" part of the program name, or two parameters?); however\n:<code>Long_path/Long_program_name Parameter_one Parameter_two</code> \u2026,\n:<code>LongPath/LongProgramName ParameterOne ParameterTwo</code> \u2026,\n:<code>\"Long path/Long program name\" \"Parameter one\" \"Parameter two\"</code> \u2026\nand\n:<code>Long\\ path/Long\\ program\\ name Parameter\\ one Parameter\\ two</code> \u2026\nare not ambiguous. [[Unix]]-based operating systems minimize the use of embedded spaces to minimize the need for quotes. In [[Microsoft Windows]], one often has to use quotes because embedded spaces (such as in directory names) are common.\n\n==Command-line interpreter==\n{{see also|List of command-line interpreters}}\n{{quotation|Although most users think of the shell as an interactive command interpreter, it is really a programming language in which each statement runs a command. Because it must satisfy both the interactive and programming aspects of command execution, it is a strange language, shaped as much by history as by design.|[[Brian W. Kernighan]] & [[Rob Pike]]<ref name=\"Kerninghan_1984\"/>}}\n\nThe term '''command-line interpreter''' ('''CLI''') is applied to [[computer program]]s designed to [[interpreter (computing)|interpret]] a sequence of lines of text which may be entered by a user, read from a [[computer file|file]] or another kind of [[data stream]]. The context of interpretation is usually one of a given [[operating system]] or [[programming language]].\n\nCommand-line interpreters allow users to issue various commands in a very efficient (and often terse) way. This requires the user to know the names of the commands and their parameters, and the syntax of the [[programming language|language]] that is interpreted.\n\nThe Unix [[Shebang (Unix)|<code>#!</code>]] mechanism and OS/2 EXTPROC command facilitate the passing of batch files to external processors.  One can use these mechanisms to write specific command processors for dedicated uses, and process external data files which reside in batch files.\n\nMany graphical interfaces, such as the OS/2 [[Presentation Manager]] and early versions of Microsoft Windows use command-lines to call helper programs to open documents and programs.  The commands are stored in the graphical shell{{clarify|date=May 2012}} or in files like the registry or the [[OS/2]] <code>OS2USER.INI</code> file.\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:TTY33ASR.jpg|thumb|A [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR teleprinter keyboard with punched tape reader and punch.]]\n[[File:Terminal-dec-vt52.jpg|thumb|[[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[VT52]] terminal.]]\nThe earliest computers did not support interactive input/output devices, often relying on [[sense switch]]es and lights to communicate with the [[computer operator]]. This was adequate for [[Batch processing|batch]] systems that ran one program at a time, often with the programmer acting as operator. This also had the advantage of low overhead, since lights and switches could be tested and set with one machine instruction. Later a single [[system console]] was added to allow the operator to communicate with the system.\n\nFrom the 1960s onwards, user interaction with computers was primarily by means of command-line interfaces, initially on machines like the [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR, but then on early [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]]-based [[computer terminals]] such as the [[VT52]].\n\nAll of these devices were purely text based, with no ability to display graphic or pictures.<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB3\"/> For business [[Application software|application programs]], text-based [[menu (computing)|menus]] were used, but for more general interaction the command line was the interface.\n\nAround 1964 [[Louis Pouzin]] introduced the concept and the name ''shell'' in [[Multics]], building on earlier, simpler facilities in the [[Compatible Time-Sharing System]] (CTSS).<ref name=\"Pouzin\"/>{{better source|introduced the concept (sic)|date=September 2013}}\n\nFrom the early 1970s the [[Unix]] operating system adapted the concept of a powerful command-line environment, and introduced the ability to ''[[Pipeline (Unix)|pipe]]'' the output of one command in as input to another. Unix also had the capability to save and re-run strings of commands as \"[[shell scripts]]\" which acted like custom commands.\n\nThe command-line was also the main interface for the early home computers such as the [[Commodore PET]], [[Apple II]] and [[BBC Micro]]&nbsp;\u2013 almost always in the form of a [[BASIC]] interpreter. When more powerful business oriented microcomputers arrived with [[CP/M]] and later [[DOS]] computers such as the [[IBM PC]], the command-line began to borrow some of the syntax and features of the Unix shells such as [[globbing]] and [[Pipeline (Unix)|piping]] of output.\n\nThe command-line was first seriously challenged by the [[PARC (company)|PARC]] [[GUI]] approach used in the 1983 [[Apple Lisa]] and the 1984 [[Apple Macintosh]]. A few computer users used GUIs such as [[GEOS (16-bit operating system)|GEOS]] and [[Windows 3.1]] but the majority of [[IBM PC]] users did not replace their [[COMMAND.COM]] shell with a GUI until [[Windows 95]] was released in 1995.<ref name=\"Betanews\"/><ref name=\"Microsoft_History\"/>\n\n===Modern usage as an operating system shell===\nWhile most non-expert computer users now use a GUI almost exclusively, more advanced users have access to powerful command-line environments:\n\n* The default VAX/VMS command shell, using the [[DIGITAL Command Language|DCL]] language, has been ported to Windows systems at least three times, including [[PC-DCL]] and Acceler8 DCL Lite. Unix command shells have been ported to VMS and DOS/Windows 95 and Windows NT types of operating systems. COMMAND.COM and Windows NT cmd.exe have been ported to Windows CE and presumably works on Microsoft Windows NT Embedded 4.0\n* Windows [[Resource Kit]] and Windows [[Services for Unix]] include Korn and the Bourne shells along with a Perl interpreter (Services of Unix contains Active State [[ActivePerl]] in later versions and [[Interix]] for versions 1 and 2 and a shell compiled by Microsoft)\n* IBM OS/2 has the [[cmd.exe]] processor. This copies the [[COMMAND.COM]] commands, with extensions to [[REXX]].\n* cmd.exe and COMMAND.COM are part of the Windows NT stream of operating systems.\n* Yet another cmd.exe is a stripped-down shell for [[Windows CE]] 3.0.\n* An MS-DOS type interpreter called [[PocketDOS]] has been ported to Windows CE machines; the most recent release is almost identical to MS-DOS 6.22 and can also run Windows 1, 2, and 3.0, [[QBasic]] and other development tools, 4NT and 4DOS. The latest release includes several shells, namely MS-DOS 6.22, PC&nbsp;DOS 7, DR&nbsp;DOS 3.xx, and others.\n* Windows users have a CLI environment named [[Windows Command Prompt]], which might use the [[CScript]] interface to alternate programs. [[PowerShell]] provides a command-line interface, but its applets are not written in [[Shell script]]. Implementations of the [[Unix shell]] are also available as part of the [[Microsoft POSIX subsystem|POSIX sub-system]],<ref name=\"Microsoft_POSIX\"/> [[Cygwin]], [[MKS Toolkit]], [[UWIN]], [[Hamilton C shell]] and other software packages. Available shells for these interoperability tools include [[C shell|csh]], [[Korn shell|ksh]], [[Bourne shell|sh]], [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], [[Restricted shell|rsh]], [[tclsh]] and less commonly [[zsh]], psh\n* COMMAND.COM (4DOS), Windows NT cmd.exe (4NT, TCC), and OS/2 cmd.exe (4OS2) and others based on them are enhanced shells which can be a replacement for the native shell or a means of enhancement of the default shell.\n* Implementations of [[PHP]] have a shell for interactive use called php-cli.\n* Standard [[Tcl/Tk]] has two interactive shells, Tclsh and Wish, the latter being the GUI version.\n* [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]],<!-- [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]], --> [[XLNT]], and other interpreters also have command shells for interactive use.\n* [[FreeBSD]] uses [[tcsh]] as its default interactive shell for the [[superuser]], and [[Almquist shell|ash]] as default scripting shell.\n* Apple [[macOS]]<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB4\"/> and many [[Linux distribution]]s have the [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]] implementation of the [[Unix shell]]. Early versions of macOS used [[tcsh]] as the default shell.\n* [[Embedded Linux]] (and other embedded [[Unix-like]]) devices often use the [[Almquist shell|Ash]] implementation of the Unix shell, as part of [[Busybox]].\n* [[Android (operating system)|Android]] uses the [[Korn shell|mksh]] shell,<ref name=\"Android_mksh\"/><ref name=\"Android_adb\"/> which replaces a shell derived from [[Almquist shell|ash]]<ref name=\"Android_sh\"/> that was used in older Android versions<!-- Not clear if switch was in Gengerbread, or before-->, supplemented with commands from the separate ''toolbox''<ref name=\"Android_Toolbox\"/> binary.\n* Routers with [[Cisco IOS]],<ref name=\"Cisco_IOS\"/> [[Junos]]<ref name=\"Juniper\"/> and many others are commonly configured from the command line.\n\n==Scripting==\nMost command-line interpreters support [[script (computer programming)|scripting]], to various extents. (They are, after all, interpreters of an [[interpreted programming language]], albeit in many cases the language is unique to the particular command-line interpreter.) They will interpret scripts (variously termed [[shell script]]s or [[batch file]]s) written in the [[programming language|language]] that they interpret. Some command-line interpreters also incorporate the interpreter engines of other languages, such as [[REXX]], in addition to their own, allowing the executing of scripts, in those languages, directly within the command-line interpreter itself.\n\nConversely, [[scripting programming language]]s, in particular those with an [[eval]] [[function (programming)|function]] (such as REXX, [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] or [[Jython]]), can be used to implement command-line interpreters and filters. For a few [[operating system]]s, most notably [[DOS]], such a command interpreter provides a more flexible command-line interface than the one supplied. In other cases, such a command interpreter can present a highly customised user interface employing the user interface and input/output facilities of the language.\n\n==Other command-line interfaces==\nThe command line provides an interface between programs as well as the user. In this sense, a command line is an alternative to a [[dialog box]]. Editors and databases present a command line, in which alternate command processors might run. On the other hand, one might have options on the command line, which opens a dialog box. The latest version of 'Take Command' has this feature. DBase used a dialog box to construct command lines, which could be further edited before use.\n\nPrograms like BASIC, Diskpart, EDLIN, and QBASIC all provide command-line interfaces, some of which use the system shell. Basic is modeled on the default interface for 8-bit Intel computers. Calculators can be run as command-line or dialog interfaces.\n\n[[Emacs]] provides a command-line interface in the form of its minibuffer. Commands and arguments can be entered using Emacs standard text editing support, and output is displayed in another buffer.\n\nThere are a number of text mode games, like ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure|Adventure]]'' or ''[[King's Quest#Series|King's Quest 1-3]]'', which relied on the user typing commands at the bottom of the screen. One controls the character by typing commands like 'get ring' or 'look'. The program returns a text which describes how the character sees it, or makes the action happen. The [[text adventure]] ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (video game)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', a piece of [[interactive fiction]] based on [[Douglas Adams|Douglas Adam's]] book of the same name, is a teletype-style command-line game.\n\nThe most notable of these interfaces is the [[standard streams]] interface, which allows the output of one command to be passed to the input of another. Text files can serve either purpose as well. This provides the interfaces of piping, filters and redirection. Under Unix, [[Everything is a file|devices are files]] too, so the normal type of file for the shell used for stdin,stdout and stderr is a [[Teleprinter#Teleprinters in computing|tty]] device file.\n\nAnother command-line interface allows a shell program to launch helper programs, either to launch documents or start a program. The command is processed internally by the shell, and then passed on to another program to launch the document. The graphical interface of Windows and OS/2 rely heavily on command-lines passed through to other programs&nbsp;\u2013 console or graphical, which then usually process the command line without presenting a user-console.\n\nPrograms like the OS/2 E editor and some other IBM [[text editor|editors]], can process command-lines normally meant for the shell, the output being placed directly in the document window.\n\nA web browser's URL input field can be used as a command line. It can be used to \"launch\" [[web app]]s, [[about:config|access browser configuration]], as well as perform a search. [[Google]], which has been called \"the command line of the internet\" will perform a domain-specific search when it detects search parameters in a known format.<ref name=\"Google\"/> This functionality is present whether the search is triggered from a browser field or on Google's website.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Comparison of command shells]]\n* [[List of command-line interpreters]]\n* [[Batch processing]]\n* [[Batch file]]\n* [[Console application]]\n* [[Interpreter directive]]\n* [[Read-eval-print loop]]\n* [[Shell (computing)]]\n* [[Scripting language]]\n* [[Shell script]]\n* [[clig]]\n* [[Computer terminal]]\n* [[Terminal emulator]]\n* [[Run command]]\n* {{Section link|Graphical user interface|Comparison to other interfaces}}\n* [[In the Beginning\u2026 Was the Command Line]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"nb\"|refs=\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB1\">An example is the comprehensive internal help system of the [[DR-DOS 7.03]] [[DEBUG (DOS command)|DEBUG]] command, which can be invoked via <code>??</code> at the debug prompt (rather than only the default <code>?</code> overview).

The program which handles the interface is called a '''command-line interpreter''' or '''command-line processor'''. Operating systems implement a command-line interface in a [[shell (computing)|shell]] for interactive access to operating system functions or services. Such access was primarily provided to users by [[computer terminal]]s starting in the mid-1960s, and continued to be used throughout the 1970s and 1980s on [[OpenVMS|VAX/VMS]], [[Unix]] systems and personal computer systems including [[DOS]], [[CP/M]] and [[Apple DOS]].\n\nToday, users rely upon [[graphical user interface]]s and menu-driven interactions. However some programming and maintenance tasks may not have a graphical user interface and may still use a command line. \n\nAlternatives to the command line interface include [[text user interface]] [[menu (computing)|menus]] (for example, [[IBM AIX SMIT]]), [[keyboard shortcut]]s, and various [[desktop metaphor]]s centered on the [[pointer (graphical user interfaces)|pointer]] (usually controlled with a [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]). Examples of this include the Microsoft Windows, [[DOSSHELL|DosShell]], and Mouse Systems PowerPanel. Command line interfaces are often implemented in terminal devices that are also capable of screen-oriented text user interfaces that use cursor addressing to place symbols on a display screen.\n\nPrograms with command-line interfaces are generally easier to automate via [[scripting language|scripting]].\n\nMany software systems implement command line interfaces for control and operation. This includes programming environments and utility programs.\n\n==Comparison to graphical user interfaces==\n[[File:Gem_11_Desktop.png|thumb|250px|A graphical user interface with icons and windows ([[GEM (desktop environment)|GEM 1.1 Desktop]])]]\nCompared with a graphical user interface, a command line interface requires fewer system resources to implement. Since options to commands are given in a few characters in each command line, an experienced user may often find the options easier to access. Automation of repetitive tasks is simplified by line editing and history mechanisms for storing frequently used sequences; this may extend to a [[scripting language]] that can take parameters and variable options. A command-line history can be kept, allowing review or repetition of commands. \n \nA command-line system may require paper or online manuals for the user's reference, although often a \"help\" option provides a concise review of the options of a command. The command-line environment may not provide the graphical enhancements such as different [[Computer font|fonts]] or extended [[window (computing)|edit windows]] found in a GUI. It may be difficult for a new user to become familiar with all the commands and options available, compared with the [[icon (computing)|icons]] and [[drop-down menu]]s of a graphical user interface, without repeated reference to manuals.\n\n==Types==\n===Operating system command-line interfaces===\n[[File:Apple Unix with Netscape.png|thumb|250px|[[Apple Computer]]'s CommandShell in [[A/UX]] 3.0.1.]]\nOperating system (OS) command-line interfaces are usually distinct programs supplied with the operating system. A program that implements such a text interface is often called a command-line interpreter, command processor or [[shell (computing)|shell]]. \n\nExamples of command-line interpreters include [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC's]] [[DIGITAL Command Language]] (DCL) in [[OpenVMS]] and [[RSX-11]], the various [[Unix shell]]s ([[Bourne shell|sh]], [[KornShell|ksh]], [[C shell|csh]], [[tcsh]], [[Z shell|zsh]], [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], etc.), [[CP/M]]'s [[Console Command Processor|CCP]], [[DOS]]'s [[COMMAND.COM]], as well as the [[OS/2]] and the Windows [[CMD.EXE]] programs, the latter groups being based heavily on DEC's RSX-11 and [[RSTS/E|RSTS]] CLIs. Under most operating systems, it is possible to replace the default shell program with alternatives; examples include [[4DOS]] for DOS, [[4OS2]] for OS/2, and [[Take Command Console|4NT / Take Command]] for Windows.\n\nAlthough the term 'shell' is often used to describe a command-line interpreter, strictly speaking a 'shell' can be any program that constitutes the user-interface, including fully graphically oriented ones. For example, the default Windows GUI is a shell program named [[EXPLORER.EXE]], as defined in the SHELL=EXPLORER.EXE line in the WIN.INI configuration file. These programs are shells, but not CLIs.\n\n===Application command-line interfaces===\n[[File:GNUOctave430.png|thumb|250px|[[GNU Octave]]'s GUI with command-line interface]]\nApplication programs (as opposed to operating systems) may also have command line interfaces.\n\nAn application program may support none, any, or all of these three major types of command line interface mechanisms:\n\n* ''Parameters'': Most operating systems support a means to pass additional information to a program when it is launched. When a program is launched from an OS command line shell, additional text provided along with the program name is passed to the launched program.\n* ''Interactive command line sessions'': After launch, a program may provide an operator with an independent means to enter commands in the form of text.\n* ''Inter-process communication'': Most operating systems support means of [[inter-process communication]] (for example, [[standard streams]] or [[named pipe]]s). Command lines from client processes may be redirected to a CLI program by one of these methods.\n\nSome applications support only a CLI, presenting a CLI prompt to the user and acting upon command lines as they are entered. Other programs support both a CLI and a GUI. In some cases, a GUI is simply a [[Wrapper function|wrapper]] around a separate CLI [[executable file]]. In other cases, a program may provide a CLI as an optional alternative to its GUI. CLIs and GUIs often support different functionality. For example, all features of [[MATLAB]], a [[numerical analysis]] computer program, are available via the CLI, whereas the MATLAB GUI exposes only a subset of features.\n\nThe early Sierra games, such as the first three ''[[King's Quest]]'' games (1984\u20131986), used commands from an internal command line to move the character around in the graphic window.\n\n==History==\nThe command-line interface evolved from a form of dialog once conducted by humans over [[teleprinter]] (TTY) machines, in which human operators remotely exchanged information, usually one line of text at a time. Early computer systems often used teleprinter machines as the means of interaction with a human operator. The computer became one end of the human-to-human teleprinter model. So instead of a human communicating with another human over a teleprinter, a human communicated with a computer.\n\nThe mechanical teleprinter was replaced by a [[dumb terminal#Early VDUs|\"glass tty\"]], a keyboard and screen emulating the teleprinter. [[computer terminal#.22Intelligent.22 terminals|\"Smart\" terminal]]s permitted additional functions, such as cursor movement over the entire screen, or local editing of data on the terminal for transmission to the computer. As the [[microcomputer revolution]] replaced the traditional{{snd}}minicomputer + terminals{{snd}}[[time sharing]] architecture, hardware terminals were replaced by [[terminal emulator]]s&nbsp;\u2014 PC software that interpreted terminal signals sent through the PC's [[serial port]]s. These were typically used to interface an organization's new PC's with their existing mini- or mainframe computers, or to connect PC to PC. Some of these PCs were running [[Bulletin Board System]] software.\n\nEarly operating system CLIs were implemented as part of [[resident monitor]] programs, and could not easily be replaced. The first implementation of the shell as a replaceable component was part of the [[Multics]] [[time-sharing]] [[operating system]].<ref name=\"Unix_Shells\"/> In 1964, [[MIT Computation Center]] staff member [[Louis Pouzin]] developed the [[RUNCOM]] tool for executing command scripts while allowing argument substitution.<ref name=\"multicians\"/> Pouzin coined the term \"[[shell (computing)|shell]]\" to describe the technique of using commands like a programming language, and wrote a paper about how to implement the idea in the [[Multics]] operating system.<ref name=\"Metz_2013\"/> Pouzin returned to his native France in 1965, and the first Multics shell was developed by [[Glenda Schroeder]].<ref name=\"multicians\"/>\n\n[[File:Version 7 UNIX SIMH PDP11 Kernels Shell.png|thumb|250px|[[Bourne shell]] interaction on [[Version 7 Unix]]]]\nThe first [[Unix shell]], the [[Thompson shell|V6 shell]], was developed by [[Ken Thompson]] in 1971 at [[Bell Labs]] and was modeled after Schroeder's Multics shell.<ref name=\"Mazieres_2004\"/><ref name=\"ibm\"/> The [[Bourne shell]] was introduced in 1977 as a replacement for the V6 shell. Although it is used as an interactive command interpreter, it was also intended as a scripting language and contains most of the features that are commonly considered to produce structured programs. The Bourne shell led to the development of the [[Korn shell]] (ksh), [[Almquist shell]] (ash), and the popular [[Bourne-again shell]] (or Bash).<ref name=\"ibm\"/>\n\nEarly microcomputers themselves were based on a command-line interface such as [[CP/M]], [[DOS]] or [[AppleSoft BASIC]]. During the 1980s and 1990s, the introduction of the [[Apple Macintosh]] and of [[Microsoft Windows]] on PCs saw the command line interface as the primary user interface replaced by the [[Graphical User Interface]]. The command line remained available as an alternative user interface, often used by [[System Administrator|system administrators]] and other advanced users for system administration, [[computer programming]] and [[batch processing]].\n\nIn November 2006, [[Microsoft]] released version 1.0 of [[Windows PowerShell]] (formerly codenamed ''Monad''), which combined features of traditional Unix shells with their proprietary object-oriented [[.NET Framework]]. [[MinGW]] and [[Cygwin]] are [[open-source software|open-source]] packages for Windows that offer a Unix-like CLI. Microsoft provides [[MKS Inc.]]'s [[Korn shell|ksh]] implementation ''MKS Korn shell'' for Windows through their [[Windows Services for UNIX|Services for UNIX]] add-on.\n\nSince 2001, the [[Macintosh]] operating system [[macOS]] has been based on a [[Unix-like]] operating system called [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]. On these computers, users can access a Unix-like command-line interface by running the [[terminal emulator]] program called [[Terminal (macOS)|Terminal]], which is found in the Utilities sub-folder of the Applications folder, or by remotely logging into the machine using [[ssh]]. [[Z shell]] is the default shell for macOS; [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], [[tcsh]], and the [[Korn shell]] are also provided. Before [[macOS Catalina]], bash was the default.\n\n==Usage==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}\nA CLI is used whenever a large vocabulary of commands or queries, coupled with a wide (or arbitrary) range of options, can be entered more rapidly as text than with a pure GUI. This is typically the case with [[operating system shell<!-- please, see [[talk:Shell (computing)]] before changing the link back -->|operating system command shell]]s. CLIs are also used by systems with insufficient resources to support a graphical user interface.  Some computer language systems (such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]], [[LISP]], [[Rexx]], and many dialects of [[BASIC]]) provide an interactive command-line mode to allow for rapid evaluation of code.\n\nCLIs are often used by programmers and system administrators, in engineering and scientific environments, and by technically advanced personal computer users. CLIs are also popular among people with visual disabilities, since the commands and responses can be displayed using [[refreshable Braille display]]s.\n\n==Anatomy of a shell CLI==\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe general pattern of an OS command line interface<ref name=\"Bash\"/><ref name=\"Microsoft_Windows\"/> is:\n\n [[#Command prompt|Prompt]] command param1 param2 param3 \u2026 paramN\n\n* [[#Command prompt|Prompt]] \u2014 generated by the program to provide context for the client.\n* Command&nbsp;\u2014 provided by the client.  Commands are usually one of three classes:\n*# Internal&nbsp;\u2014 recognized and processed by the command line interpreter itself and not dependent upon any external executable file.\n*# Included&nbsp;\u2014 A separate executable file generally considered part of the operating environment and always included with the OS.\n*# External&nbsp;\u2014 External executable files not part of the basic OS, but added by other parties for specific purposes and applications.\n* param1 \u2026paramN&nbsp;\u2014 Optional parameters provided by the client.  The format and meaning of the parameters depends upon the command issued. In the case of Included or External commands, the values of the parameters are delivered to the program (specified by the Command) as it is launched by the OS.  Parameters may be either [[Argument (computer science)#Parameters and arguments|Arguments]] or [[Command-line option|Options]].\n\nIn this example, the delimiters between command line elements are [[whitespace character]]s and the end-of-line delimiter is the [[newline]] delimiter. This is a widely used (but not universal) convention for command-line interfaces.\n\n<!-- Above is more 'anatomy' and below is a bit mote theory and background and higher level concepts. Maybe separate sections for both? -->\nA CLI can generally be considered as consisting of [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] and [[semantics]]. The ''syntax'' is the grammar that all commands must follow. In the case of [[operating system]]s, [[DOS]] and [[Unix]] each define their own set of rules that all commands must follow. In the case of [[embedded systems]], each vendor, such as [[Nortel]], [[Juniper Networks]] or [[Cisco Systems]], defines their own proprietary set of rules that all commands within their CLI conform to. These rules also dictate how a user navigates through the system of commands. The ''semantics'' define what sort of operations are possible, on what sort of data these operations can be performed, and how the grammar represents these operations and data\u2014the symbolic meaning in the syntax.\n\nTwo different CLIs may agree on either syntax or semantics, but it is only when they agree on both that they can be considered sufficiently similar to allow users to use both CLIs without needing to learn anything, as well as to enable re-use of scripts.\n\nA simple CLI will display a prompt, accept a \"command line\" typed by the user terminated by the [[Enter key]], then execute the specified command and provide textual display of results or error messages.  Advanced CLIs will validate, interpret and parameter-expand the command line before executing the specified command, and optionally capture or redirect its output.\n\nUnlike a button or menu item in a GUI, a command line is typically self-documenting, stating exactly what the user wants done.  In addition, command lines usually include many [[Default (computer science)|default]]s that can be changed to customize the results.  Useful command lines can be saved by assigning a [[character string]] or [[alias (command)|alias]] to represent the full command, or several commands can be grouped to perform a more complex sequence&nbsp;\u2013 for instance, compile the program, install it, and run it&nbsp;\u2014 creating a single entity, called a command procedure or script which itself can be treated as a command. These advantages mean that a user must figure out a complex command or series of commands only once, because they can be saved, to be used again.\n\nThe commands given to a CLI shell are often in one of the following forms:\n\n* {{kbd|doSomething how toFiles}}\n* {{kbd|doSomething how sourceFile destinationFile}}\n* {{kbd|doSomething how < inputFile > outputFile}}\n* {{kbd|doSomething how {{!}} doSomething how {{!}} doSomething how > outputFile}}\n\nwhere ''doSomething'' is, in effect, a [[verb]], ''how'' an [[adverb]] (for example, should the command be executed \"verbosely\" or \"quietly\") and ''toFiles'' an object or objects (typically one or more files) on which the command should act. The <code>&gt;</code> in the third example is a [[redirection operator]], telling the command-line interpreter to send the output of the command not to its own standard output (the screen) but to the named file. This will overwrite the file. Using <code>&gt;&gt;</code> will redirect the output and append it to the file. Another redirection operator is the [[vertical bar]] (<code>|</code>), which creates a [[pipeline (Unix)|pipeline]] where the output of one command becomes the input to the next command.\n\n===CLI and resource protection===\nOne can modify the set of available commands by modifying which paths appear in the [[PATH (variable)|PATH]] environment variable. Under Unix, commands also need be marked as [[executable]] files. The directories in the path variable are searched in the order they are given. By re-ordering the path, one can run e.g. \\OS2\\MDOS\\E.EXE instead of \\OS2\\E.EXE, when the default is the opposite. Renaming of the executables also works: people often rename their favourite editor to EDIT, for example.\n\nThe command line allows one to restrict available commands, such as access to advanced internal commands.  The Windows [[CMD.EXE]] does this. Often, shareware programs will limit the range of commands, including printing a command 'your administrator has disabled running batch files' from the prompt.\n\nSome CLIs, such as those in [[network router]]s, have a hierarchy of [[mode (user interface)|mode]]s, with a different set of commands supported in each mode. The set of commands are grouped by association with security, system, interface, etc. In these systems the user might traverse through a series of sub-modes. For example, if the CLI had two modes called ''interface'' and ''system'', the user might use the command ''interface'' to enter the interface mode. At this point, commands from the system mode may not be accessible until the user exits the interface mode and enters the system mode.\n\n===Command prompt===\n[[File:Hard reset BBC Micro 32K Acorn DFS.gif|thumb|Prompt of a [[BBC Micro]] after switch-on or hard reset.]]\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Z shell]], [[Prompt]] and [[Abort, Retry, Fail]] -->\n{{Redirect|Command prompt|the Windows component named Command Prompt|cmd.exe}}\nA command prompt (or just ''prompt'') is a sequence of (one or more) characters used in a command-line interface to indicate readiness to accept commands.  It literally [[Wiktionary:prompt|prompt]]s the user to take action. A prompt usually ends with one of the characters <code>$</code>, <code>%</code>, <code>#</code>,<ref name=\"DR_1978_SID\"/><ref name=\"DR_1982_SID86\"/> <code>:</code>, <code>&gt;</code> or <code>-</code><!-- DOS DEBUG --><ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> and often includes other information, such as the path of the current [[working directory]] and the [[hostname]].\n\nOn many [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like|derivative systems]], the prompt commonly ends in  <code>$</code> or <code>%</code> if the user is a normal user, but in <code>#</code> if the user is a [[superuser]] (\"root\" in Unix terminology).\n\nEnd-users can often modify prompts. Depending on the environment, they may include colors, special characters, and other elements (like variables and functions for the current time, user, shell number or working directory) in order, for instance, to make the prompt more informative or visually pleasing, to distinguish sessions on various machines, or to indicate the current level of nesting of commands. On some systems, special tokens in the definition of the prompt can be used to cause external programs to be called by the command-line interpreter while displaying the prompt.\n\nIn DOS's COMMAND.COM and in Windows NT's [[cmd.exe]] users can modify the prompt by issuing a <code>PROMPT</code> command or by directly changing the value of the corresponding <code>[[%PROMPT%]]</code> [[environment variable]]. The default of most modern systems, the <code>C:\\></code> style is obtained, for instance, with <code>PROMPT $P$G</code>. The default of older DOS systems, <code>C></code> is obtained by just <code>PROMPT</code>, although on some systems this produces the newer <code>C:\\></code> style, unless used on floppy drives A: or B:; on those systems <code>PROMPT $N$G</code> can be used to override the automatic default and explicitly switch to the older style.\n\nMany Unix systems feature the <code>$PS1</code> variable (Prompt String 1),<ref name=\"Parker_2011\"/> although other variables also may affect the prompt (depending on the [[Unix shell|shell]] used). In the [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]] shell, a prompt of the form:\n\n<source lang=\"bash\">[time] user@host: work_dir $</source>\ncould be set by issuing the command\n<source lang=\"bash\">export PS1='[\\t] \\u@\\H: \\W $'</source>\n\nIn [[zsh]] the <code>$RPROMPT</code> variable controls an optional \"prompt\" on the right-hand side of the display. It is not a real prompt in that the location of text entry does not change. It is used to display information on the same line as the prompt, but right-justified.\n\nIn [[RISC OS]] the command prompt is a <code>*</code> symbol, and thus (OS)CLI commands are often referred to as \"star commands\".<ref name=\"Acorn_1992\"/> One can also access the same commands from other command lines (such as the [[BBC BASIC]] command line), by preceding the command with a <code>*</code>.\n\n==={{anchor|Arguments_section}}Arguments===\n[[File:COMMAND LINE.svg|thumb|right|An MS-DOS command line, illustrating parsing into command and arguments]]\nA '''command-line argument''' or '''[[Parameter#Computing|parameter]]''' is an item of information provided to a program when it is started.  A program can have many command-line arguments that identify sources or destinations of information, or that alter the operation of the program.\n\nWhen a command processor is active a program is typically invoked by typing its name followed by command-line arguments (if any). For example, in [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] environments, an example of a command-line argument is:\n\n<source lang=\"bash\">\nrm file.s\n</source>\n\n\"file.s\" is a command-line argument which tells the program [[rm (Unix)|rm]] to remove the file \"file.s\".\n\nSome programming languages, such as [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], allow a program to interpret the command-line arguments by handling them as string parameters in the [[Main function (programming)|main function]]. Other languages, such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], expose operating system specific [[Application programming interface|API]] (functionality) through <code>sys</code> [[Modular programming|module]], and in particular <code>sys.argv</code> for \"command-line arguments\".\n\nIn [[Unix-like operating system]]s, a single hyphen used in place of a file name is a special value specifying that a program should handle data coming from the [[standard input]] or send data to the [[standard output]].\n\n===={{anchor|SwitChar}}Command-line option====\n<!-- This section is linked from several places inside or outside this article, preferable by \"#SwitChar\". Do not remove or rename this section heading without also updating the links. -->\nA '''command-line option''' or simply '''option''' (also known as a '''flag''' or '''switch''') modifies the operation of a command; the effect is determined by the command's program. Options follow the command name on the command line, separated by spaces. A space before the first option is not always required, such as <code>Dir/?</code> and <code style=\"white-space:nowrap\">DIR /?</code> in DOS, which have the same effect<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> of listing the DIR command's available options, whereas <code>dir --help</code> (in many versions of Unix) ''does'' require the option to be preceded by at least one space (and is case-sensitive).\n\nThe format of options varies widely between operating systems. In most cases the syntax is by convention rather than an operating system requirement; the entire command line is simply a string passed to a program, which can process it in any way the programmer wants, so long as the interpreter can tell where the command name ends and its arguments and options begin.\n\nA few representative samples of command-line options, all relating to listing files in a directory, to illustrate some conventions:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Operating system !! Command !! Valid alternative !! Notes\n|-\n| [[OpenVMS]] || <code>directory/owner</code> || <code>Dir /Owner</code> || instruct the ''directory'' command to also display the ownership of the files.<br><small>''Note the Directory command name is not case sensitive, and can be abbreviated to as few letters as required to remain unique.''</small>\n|-\n| Windows || <code>DIR/Q/O:S d*</code> || <code>dir /q d* /o:s</code> || display ownership of files whose names begin with \"D\", sorted by size, smallest first.<br><small>''Note spaces around argument d* are required.''</small>\n|-\n| [[Unix-like]] systems || <code>ls -lS D*</code> || <code>ls -S -l D*</code> || display in long format files and directories beginning with \"D\" (but not \"d\"), sorted by size (largest first).<br><small>''Note spaces are required around all arguments and options, but some can be run together, e.g. '''-lS''' is the same as '''-l -S'''.''</small>\n|-\n| [[Data General RDOS]] [[Data General RDOS#RDOS CLI|CLI]]|| <code>list/e/s 04-26-80/b</code> || <code>List /S/E 4-26-80/B</code> || list every attribute for files created before 26 April 1980.<br><small>''Note the /B at the end of the date argument is a '''local switch''', that modifies the meaning of that argument, while /S and /E are '''global switches''', i.e. apply to the whole command.''</small>\n|}\n\n=====Abbreviating commands=====\n{{See also|Tab completion}}\nIn [[Multics]], command-line options and subsystem keywords may be abbreviated. This idea appears to derive from the [[PL/I programming language]], with its shortened keywords (e.g., STRG for STRINGRANGE and DCL for DECLARE). For example, in the Multics \"forum\" subsystem, the ''-long_subject'' parameter can be abbreviated ''-lgsj''. It is also common for Multics commands to be abbreviated, typically corresponding to the initial letters of the words that are strung together with underscores to form command names, such as the use of ''did'' for ''delete_iacl_dir''.\n\nIn some other systems abbreviations are automatic, such as permitting enough of the first characters of a command name to uniquely identify it (such as <code>SU</code> as an abbreviation for <code>SUPERUSER</code>) while others may have some specific abbreviations pre-programmed (e.g. <code>MD</code> for <code>[[MKDIR]]</code> in COMMAND.COM) or user-defined via batch scripts and aliases (e.g. <code>alias md mkdir</code> in [[tcsh]]).\n\n=====Option conventions in DOS, Windows, OS/2=====\nOn DOS, OS/2 and Windows, different programs called from their COMMAND.COM or CMD.EXE (or internal their commands) may use different syntax within the same operating system. For example:\n\n* Options may be indicated by either of the \"switch characters\": <code>/</code>, <code>-</code>, or either may be allowed. See below.\n* They may or may not be [[case-sensitive]].\n* Sometimes options and their arguments are run together, sometimes separated by whitespace, and sometimes by a character, typically <code>:</code> or <code>=</code>; thus <code>Prog -fFilename</code>, <code>Prog -f Filename</code>, <code>Prog -f:Filename</code>, <code>Prog -f=Filename</code>.\n* Some programs allow single-character options to be combined;<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> others do not. The switch <code>-fA</code> may mean the same as <code>-f -A</code>,<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> or it may be incorrect, or it may even be a valid but different parameter.\n\nIn [[DOS]], [[OS/2]] and [[Windows]], the forward slash (<code>/</code>) is most prevalent, although the hyphen-minus is also sometimes used. In many versions of DOS (MS-DOS/PC&nbsp;DOS 2.xx and higher, all versions of [[DR-DOS]] since 5.0, as well as [[PTS-DOS]], [[Embedded DOS]], [[FreeDOS]] and [[RxDOS]]) the '''switch character''' (sometimes abbreviated '''switchar''' or '''switchchar''') to be used is defined by a value returned from a [[system call]] ([[INT&nbsp;21h]]/AH=37h). The default character returned by this API is <code>/</code>, but can be changed to a hyphen-minus on the above-mentioned systems, except for under Datalight ROM-DOS and MS-DOS/PC&nbsp;DOS 5.0 and higher, which always return <code>/</code> from this call (unless one of many available [[Terminate & Stay Resident|TSR]]s to reenable the SwitChar feature is loaded). In some of these systems (MS-DOS/PC&nbsp;DOS 2.xx, DOS Plus 2.1, DR-DOS 7.02 and higher, PTS-DOS, Embedded DOS, FreeDOS and RxDOS), the setting can also be pre-configured by a [[SWITCHAR (CONFIG.SYS directive)|SWITCHAR]] directive in [[CONFIG.SYS]]. General Software's Embedded DOS provides a SWITCH command for the same purpose, whereas [[4DOS]] allows the setting to be changed via <code>SETDOS /W:n</code>.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> Under DR-DOS, if the setting has been changed from <code>/</code>, the first directory separator <code>\\</code> in the display of the [[PROMPT (DOS command)|PROMPT]] parameter <code>$G</code> will change to a forward slash <code>/</code> (which is also a valid directory separator in DOS, FlexOS, 4680 OS, 4690 OS, OS/2 and Windows) thereby serving as a visual clue to indicate the change.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> Also, the current setting is reflected also in the built-in help screens.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> Some versions of DR-DOS [[COMMAND.COM]]<!-- 7.07 --> also support a PROMPT token <code>$/</code> to display the current setting. COMMAND.COM since DR-DOS 7.02 also provides a [[pseudo-environment variable]] named <code>[[%/%]]</code> to allow portable batchjobs to be written.<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_DELTREE101\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_1998_NEW703\"/> Several external DR-DOS commands<!-- f.e. SYS in DR-DOS 7.07 --> additionally support an [[environment variable]] <code>[[%SWITCHAR%]]</code> to override the system setting.\n\nHowever, many programs are hardwired to use <code>/</code> only, rather than retrieving the switch setting before parsing command-line arguments. A very small number, mainly ports from Unix-like systems, are programmed to accept \"-\" even if the switch character is not set to it (for example <code>[[netstat]]</code> and <code>[[ping (networking utility)|ping]]</code>, supplied with [[Microsoft Windows]], will accept the /? option to list available options, and yet the list will specify the \"-\" convention).\n\n=====Option conventions in Unix-like systems=====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}\nIn [[Unix-like]] systems, the ASCII [[hyphen-minus]] begins options; the new (and [[GNU]]) convention is to use ''two'' hyphens then a word (e.g. <code>--create</code>) to identify the option's use while the old convention (and still available as an option for frequently-used options) is to use one hyphen then one letter (e.g., <code>-c</code>); if one hyphen is followed by two or more letters it may mean two options are being specified, or it may mean the second and subsequent letters are a parameter (such as filename or date) for the first option.\n\nTwo hyphen-minus characters without following letters (<code>--</code>) may indicate that the remaining arguments should not be treated as options, which is useful for example if a file name itself begins with a hyphen, or if further arguments are meant for an inner command (e.g., [[sudo]]). Double hyphen-minuses are also sometimes used to prefix \"long options\" where more descriptive option names are used. This is a common feature of [[GNU]] software. The ''[[getopt]]'' function and program, and the ''[[getopts]]'' command are usually used for parsing command-line options.\n\nUnix command names, arguments and options are case-sensitive (except in a few examples, mainly where popular commands from other operating systems have been ported to Unix).\n\n=====Option conventions in other systems=====\n[[FlexOS]], [[IBM 4680 OS|4680 OS]] and [[IBM 4690 OS|4690 OS]] use <code>-</code>.\n\n[[CP/M]] typically used <code><nowiki>[</nowiki></code>.\n\n[[Conversational Monitor System]] (CMS) uses a single [[Bracket#Parentheses .28 .29|left parenthesis]] to separate options at the end of the command from the other arguments.  For example, in the following command the options indicate that the target file should be replaced if it exists, and the date and time of the source file should be retained on the copy:\n<code>COPY source file a target file b (REPLACE OLDDATE</code>\n\n[[Data General]]'s CLI under their [[Data General RDOS|RDOS]], [[Data General AOS|AOS]], etc. operating systems, as well as the version of CLI that came with their [[Business Basic]], uses only <code>/</code> as the switch character, is case-insensitive, and allows \"local switches\" on some arguments to control the way they are interpreted, such as <code>MAC/U LIB/S A B C $LPT/L</code> has the global option \"U\" to the macro assembler command to append user symbols, but two local switches, one to specify LIB should be skipped on pass 2 and the other to direct listing to the printer, $LPT.\n\n===Built-in usage help===\n{{see also|help (command)}}\nOne of the criticisms of a CLI is the lack of cues to the user as to the available actions.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  In contrast, GUIs usually inform the user of available actions with menus, icons, or other visual cues.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} To overcome this limitation, many CLI programs display a brief summary of its valid parameters, typically when invoked with no arguments or one of <code>?</code>, <code>-?</code>, <code>-h</code>, <code>-H</code>, <code>/?</code>, <code>/h</code>, <code>/H</code>, <code>/Help</code>, <code>-help</code>, or <code>--help</code>.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_CPI\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_DEBUG\"/>  \n\nHowever, entering a program name without parameters in the hope that it will display usage help can be hazardous, as programs and scripts for which command line arguments are optional will execute without further notice.\n\nAlthough desirable at least for the help parameter, programs may not support all option lead-in characters exemplified above.\nUnder DOS, where the default [[Command-line_interface#Option_conventions_in_DOS.2C_Windows.2C_OS.2F2|command-line option character]] can be changed from <code>/</code> to <code>-</code>, programs may query the [[SwitChar]] API in order to determine the current setting. So, if a program is not hardwired to support them all, a user may need to know the current setting even to be able to reliably request help.\nIf the SwitChar has been changed to <code>-</code> and therefore the <code>/</code> character is accepted as alternative path delimiter also at the DOS command line, programs may misinterpret options like <code>/h</code> or <code>/H</code> as paths rather than help parameters.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> However, if given as first or only parameter, most DOS programs will, by convention<!-- at least in all versions of DR-DOS as well as under 4DOS and NDOS -->, accept it as request for help regardless of the current SwitChar setting.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/>\n\nIn some cases, different levels of help can be selected for a program. Some programs supporting this allow to give a verbosity level as an optional argument to the help parameter (as in <code>/H:1</code>, <code>/H:2</code>, etc.) or they give just a short help on help parameters with question mark and a longer help screen for the other help options.<ref name=\"Paul_2006_FreeKEYB\"/>\n\nDepending on the program, additional or more specific help on accepted parameters is sometimes available by either providing the parameter in question as an argument to the help parameter or vice versa (as in <code>/H:W</code> or in <code>/W:?</code> (assuming <code>/W</code> would be another parameter supported by the program)).<ref name=\"CCI_1997_HELP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_DRDOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_DEBUG\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_CPI\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2006_FreeKEYB\"/><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB1\"/>\n\nIn a similar fashion to the help parameter, but much less common, some programs provide additional information about themselves (like mode, status, version, author, license or contact information) when invoked with an \"about\" parameter like <code>-!</code>, <code>/!</code>, <code>-about</code>, or <code>--about</code>.<ref name=\"Paul_2002_CPI\"/>\n\nSince the <code>?</code> and <code>!</code> characters typically also serve other purposes at the command line, they may not be available in all scenarios, therefore, they should not be the only options to access the corresponding help information.\n\n[[File:RT-11 help.jpg|thumb|The end of the <tt>HELP</tt> command output from [[:en:RT-11|RT-11SJ]] displayed on a [[:en:VT100|VT100]].]]\nIf more detailed help is necessary than provided by a program's built-in internal help, many systems support a dedicated external \"<code>[[help (command)|help]] ''command''</code>\" command (or similar), which accepts a command name as calling parameter and will invoke an external help system.\n\nIn the DR-DOS family, typing <code>/?</code> or <code>/H</code> at the [[COMMAND.COM]] prompt instead of a command itself will display a dynamically generated list of available internal commands;<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> [[4DOS]] and [[NDOS]] support the same feature by typing <code>?</code> at the prompt<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> (which is also accepted by newer versions<!-- only 7.02 and higher --> of DR-DOS COMMAND.COM); internal commands can be individually disabled or reenabled via <code>SETDOS /I</code>.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> In addition to this, some newer versions of DR-DOS COMMAND.COM<!-- 7.07 --> also accept a <code>?%</code> command to display a list of available built-in [[DR-DOS system information variable|pseudo-environment variable]]s. Besides their purpose as quick help reference this can be used in batchjobs to query the facilities of the underlying command-line processor.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/>\n\n===Command description syntax===\nBuilt-in usage help and [[man page]]s commonly employ a small syntax to describe the valid command form:<ref name=\"OpenGroup_2008\"/><ref name=\"Microsoft_2005_Shell\"/><ref name=\"Microsoft_2010_Syntax\"/><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB2\"/>\n\n* angle brackets for ''required'' parameters: <code>ping <hostname></code>\n* square brackets for ''optional'' parameters: <code>mkdir [-p] <dirname></code>\n* ellipses for ''repeated'' items: <code>cp <source1> [source2\u2026] <dest></code>\n* vertical bars for ''choice'' of items: <code>netstat {-t|-u}</code>\n\nNotice that these characters have different meanings than when used directly in the shell. Angle brackets may be omitted when confusing the parameter name with a literal string is not likely.\n\n===The space character===\n<!-- this is a file-system feature, nothing to do with the command line -->\nIn many areas of computing, but particularly in the command line, the [[space character]] can cause problems as it has two distinct and incompatible functions: as part of a command or parameter, or as a parameter or name [[Delimiter|separator]]. Ambiguity can be prevented either by prohibiting embedded spaces in file and directory names in the first place (for example, by substituting them with [[underscores]] <code>_</code>), or by enclosing a name with embedded spaces between quote characters or using an [[escape character]] before the space, usually a [[backslash]] (<code>\\</code>).  For example\n:<code>Long path/Long program name Parameter one Parameter two</code> \u2026\nis ambiguous (is \"program name\" part of the program name, or two parameters?); however\n:<code>Long_path/Long_program_name Parameter_one Parameter_two</code> \u2026,\n:<code>LongPath/LongProgramName ParameterOne ParameterTwo</code> \u2026,\n:<code>\"Long path/Long program name\" \"Parameter one\" \"Parameter two\"</code> \u2026\nand\n:<code>Long\\ path/Long\\ program\\ name Parameter\\ one Parameter\\ two</code> \u2026\nare not ambiguous. [[Unix]]-based operating systems minimize the use of embedded spaces to minimize the need for quotes. In [[Microsoft Windows]], one often has to use quotes because embedded spaces (such as in directory names) are common.\n\n==Command-line interpreter==\n{{see also|List of command-line interpreters}}\n{{quotation|Although most users think of the shell as an interactive command interpreter, it is really a programming language in which each statement runs a command. Because it must satisfy both the interactive and programming aspects of command execution, it is a strange language, shaped as much by history as by design.|[[Brian W. Kernighan]] & [[Rob Pike]]<ref name=\"Kerninghan_1984\"/>}}\n\nThe term '''command-line interpreter''' ('''CLI''') is applied to [[computer program]]s designed to [[interpreter (computing)|interpret]] a sequence of lines of text which may be entered by a user, read from a [[computer file|file]] or another kind of [[data stream]]. The context of interpretation is usually one of a given [[operating system]] or [[programming language]].\n\nCommand-line interpreters allow users to issue various commands in a very efficient (and often terse) way. This requires the user to know the names of the commands and their parameters, and the syntax of the [[programming language|language]] that is interpreted.\n\nThe Unix [[Shebang (Unix)|<code>#!</code>]] mechanism and OS/2 EXTPROC command facilitate the passing of batch files to external processors.  One can use these mechanisms to write specific command processors for dedicated uses, and process external data files which reside in batch files.\n\nMany graphical interfaces, such as the OS/2 [[Presentation Manager]] and early versions of Microsoft Windows use command-lines to call helper programs to open documents and programs.  The commands are stored in the graphical shell{{clarify|date=May 2012}} or in files like the registry or the [[OS/2]] <code>OS2USER.INI</code> file.\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:TTY33ASR.jpg|thumb|A [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR teleprinter keyboard with punched tape reader and punch.]]\n[[File:Terminal-dec-vt52.jpg|thumb|[[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[VT52]] terminal.]]\nThe earliest computers did not support interactive input/output devices, often relying on [[sense switch]]es and lights to communicate with the [[computer operator]]. This was adequate for [[Batch processing|batch]] systems that ran one program at a time, often with the programmer acting as operator. This also had the advantage of low overhead, since lights and switches could be tested and set with one machine instruction. Later a single [[system console]] was added to allow the operator to communicate with the system.\n\nFrom the 1960s onwards, user interaction with computers was primarily by means of command-line interfaces, initially on machines like the [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR, but then on early [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]]-based [[computer terminals]] such as the [[VT52]].\n\nAll of these devices were purely text based, with no ability to display graphic or pictures.<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB3\"/> For business [[Application software|application programs]], text-based [[menu (computing)|menus]] were used, but for more general interaction the command line was the interface.\n\nAround 1964 [[Louis Pouzin]] introduced the concept and the name ''shell'' in [[Multics]], building on earlier, simpler facilities in the [[Compatible Time-Sharing System]] (CTSS).<ref name=\"Pouzin\"/>{{better source|introduced the concept (sic)|date=September 2013}}\n\nFrom the early 1970s the [[Unix]] operating system adapted the concept of a powerful command-line environment, and introduced the ability to ''[[Pipeline (Unix)|pipe]]'' the output of one command in as input to another. Unix also had the capability to save and re-run strings of commands as \"[[shell scripts]]\" which acted like custom commands.\n\nThe command-line was also the main interface for the early home computers such as the [[Commodore PET]], [[Apple II]] and [[BBC Micro]]&nbsp;\u2013 almost always in the form of a [[BASIC]] interpreter. When more powerful business oriented microcomputers arrived with [[CP/M]] and later [[DOS]] computers such as the [[IBM PC]], the command-line began to borrow some of the syntax and features of the Unix shells such as [[globbing]] and [[Pipeline (Unix)|piping]] of output.\n\nThe command-line was first seriously challenged by the [[PARC (company)|PARC]] [[GUI]] approach used in the 1983 [[Apple Lisa]] and the 1984 [[Apple Macintosh]]. A few computer users used GUIs such as [[GEOS (16-bit operating system)|GEOS]] and [[Windows 3.1]] but the majority of [[IBM PC]] users did not replace their [[COMMAND.COM]] shell with a GUI until [[Windows 95]] was released in 1995.<ref name=\"Betanews\"/><ref name=\"Microsoft_History\"/>\n\n===Modern usage as an operating system shell===\nWhile most non-expert computer users now use a GUI almost exclusively, more advanced users have access to powerful command-line environments:\n\n* The default VAX/VMS command shell, using the [[DIGITAL Command Language|DCL]] language, has been ported to Windows systems at least three times, including [[PC-DCL]] and Acceler8 DCL Lite. Unix command shells have been ported to VMS and DOS/Windows 95 and Windows NT types of operating systems. COMMAND.COM and Windows NT cmd.exe have been ported to Windows CE and presumably works on Microsoft Windows NT Embedded 4.0\n* Windows [[Resource Kit]] and Windows [[Services for Unix]] include Korn and the Bourne shells along with a Perl interpreter (Services of Unix contains Active State [[ActivePerl]] in later versions and [[Interix]] for versions 1 and 2 and a shell compiled by Microsoft)\n* IBM OS/2 has the [[cmd.exe]] processor. This copies the [[COMMAND.COM]] commands, with extensions to [[REXX]].\n* cmd.exe and COMMAND.COM are part of the Windows NT stream of operating systems.\n* Yet another cmd.exe is a stripped-down shell for [[Windows CE]] 3.0.\n* An MS-DOS type interpreter called [[PocketDOS]] has been ported to Windows CE machines; the most recent release is almost identical to MS-DOS 6.22 and can also run Windows 1, 2, and 3.0, [[QBasic]] and other development tools, 4NT and 4DOS. The latest release includes several shells, namely MS-DOS 6.22, PC&nbsp;DOS 7, DR&nbsp;DOS 3.xx, and others.\n* Windows users have a CLI environment named [[Windows Command Prompt]], which might use the [[CScript]] interface to alternate programs. [[PowerShell]] provides a command-line interface, but its applets are not written in [[Shell script]]. Implementations of the [[Unix shell]] are also available as part of the [[Microsoft POSIX subsystem|POSIX sub-system]],<ref name=\"Microsoft_POSIX\"/> [[Cygwin]], [[MKS Toolkit]], [[UWIN]], [[Hamilton C shell]] and other software packages. Available shells for these interoperability tools include [[C shell|csh]], [[Korn shell|ksh]], [[Bourne shell|sh]], [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], [[Restricted shell|rsh]], [[tclsh]] and less commonly [[zsh]], psh\n* COMMAND.COM (4DOS), Windows NT cmd.exe (4NT, TCC), and OS/2 cmd.exe (4OS2) and others based on them are enhanced shells which can be a replacement for the native shell or a means of enhancement of the default shell.\n* Implementations of [[PHP]] have a shell for interactive use called php-cli.\n* Standard [[Tcl/Tk]] has two interactive shells, Tclsh and Wish, the latter being the GUI version.\n* [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]],<!-- [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]], --> [[XLNT]], and other interpreters also have command shells for interactive use.\n* [[FreeBSD]] uses [[tcsh]] as its default interactive shell for the [[superuser]], and [[Almquist shell|ash]] as default scripting shell.\n* Apple [[macOS]]<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB4\"/> and many [[Linux distribution]]s have the [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]] implementation of the [[Unix shell]]. Early versions of macOS used [[tcsh]] as the default shell.\n* [[Embedded Linux]] (and other embedded [[Unix-like]]) devices often use the [[Almquist shell|Ash]] implementation of the Unix shell, as part of [[Busybox]].\n* [[Android (operating system)|Android]] uses the [[Korn shell|mksh]] shell,<ref name=\"Android_mksh\"/><ref name=\"Android_adb\"/> which replaces a shell derived from [[Almquist shell|ash]]<ref name=\"Android_sh\"/> that was used in older Android versions<!-- Not clear if switch was in Gengerbread, or before-->, supplemented with commands from the separate ''toolbox''<ref name=\"Android_Toolbox\"/> binary.\n* Routers with [[Cisco IOS]],<ref name=\"Cisco_IOS\"/> [[Junos]]<ref name=\"Juniper\"/> and many others are commonly configured from the command line.\n\n==Scripting==\nMost command-line interpreters support [[script (computer programming)|scripting]], to various extents. (They are, after all, interpreters of an [[interpreted programming language]], albeit in many cases the language is unique to the particular command-line interpreter.) They will interpret scripts (variously termed [[shell script]]s or [[batch file]]s) written in the [[programming language|language]] that they interpret. Some command-line interpreters also incorporate the interpreter engines of other languages, such as [[REXX]], in addition to their own, allowing the executing of scripts, in those languages, directly within the command-line interpreter itself.\n\nConversely, [[scripting programming language]]s, in particular those with an [[eval]] [[function (programming)|function]] (such as REXX, [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] or [[Jython]]), can be used to implement command-line interpreters and filters. For a few [[operating system]]s, most notably [[DOS]], such a command interpreter provides a more flexible command-line interface than the one supplied. In other cases, such a command interpreter can present a highly customised user interface employing the user interface and input/output facilities of the language.\n\n==Other command-line interfaces==\nThe command line provides an interface between programs as well as the user. In this sense, a command line is an alternative to a [[dialog box]]. Editors and databases present a command line, in which alternate command processors might run. On the other hand, one might have options on the command line, which opens a dialog box. The latest version of 'Take Command' has this feature. DBase used a dialog box to construct command lines, which could be further edited before use.\n\nPrograms like BASIC, Diskpart, EDLIN, and QBASIC all provide command-line interfaces, some of which use the system shell. Basic is modeled on the default interface for 8-bit Intel computers. Calculators can be run as command-line or dialog interfaces.\n\n[[Emacs]] provides a command-line interface in the form of its minibuffer. Commands and arguments can be entered using Emacs standard text editing support, and output is displayed in another buffer.\n\nThere are a number of text mode games, like ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure|Adventure]]'' or ''[[King's Quest#Series|King's Quest 1-3]]'', which relied on the user typing commands at the bottom of the screen. One controls the character by typing commands like 'get ring' or 'look'. The program returns a text which describes how the character sees it, or makes the action happen. The [[text adventure]] ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (video game)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', a piece of [[interactive fiction]] based on [[Douglas Adams|Douglas Adam's]] book of the same name, is a teletype-style command-line game.\n\nThe most notable of these interfaces is the [[standard streams]] interface, which allows the output of one command to be passed to the input of another. Text files can serve either purpose as well. This provides the interfaces of piping, filters and redirection. Under Unix, [[Everything is a file|devices are files]] too, so the normal type of file for the shell used for stdin,stdout and stderr is a [[Teleprinter#Teleprinters in computing|tty]] device file.\n\nAnother command-line interface allows a shell program to launch helper programs, either to launch documents or start a program. The command is processed internally by the shell, and then passed on to another program to launch the document. The graphical interface of Windows and OS/2 rely heavily on command-lines passed through to other programs&nbsp;\u2013 console or graphical, which then usually process the command line without presenting a user-console.\n\nPrograms like the OS/2 E editor and some other IBM [[text editor|editors]], can process command-lines normally meant for the shell, the output being placed directly in the document window.\n\nA web browser's URL input field can be used as a command line. It can be used to \"launch\" [[web app]]s, [[about:config|access browser configuration]], as well as perform a search. [[Google]], which has been called \"the command line of the internet\" will perform a domain-specific search when it detects search parameters in a known format.<ref name=\"Google\"/> This functionality is present whether the search is triggered from a browser field or on Google's website.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Comparison of command shells]]\n* [[List of command-line interpreters]]\n* [[Batch processing]]\n* [[Batch file]]\n* [[Console application]]\n* [[Interpreter directive]]\n* [[Read-eval-print loop]]\n* [[Shell (computing)]]\n* [[Scripting language]]\n* [[Shell script]]\n* [[clig]]\n* [[Computer terminal]]\n* [[Terminal emulator]]\n* [[Run command]]\n* {{Section link|Graphical user interface|Comparison to other interfaces}}\n* [[In the Beginning\u2026 Was the Command Line]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"nb\"|refs=\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB1\">An example is the comprehensive internal help system of the [[DR-DOS 7.03]] [[DEBUG (DOS command)|DEBUG]] command, which can be invoked via <code>??</code> at the debug prompt (rather than only the default <code>?</code> overview).

As Lawrie was saved by Lifeline Vote, Aalto performed \"[[Run (Snow Patrol song)|Run]]\" in a sing-off against Parker. Walsh and Osbourne voted to eliminate Parker while Scherzinger and [[Simon Cowell]], who had the casting vote, voted to eliminate Aalto. This meant Cowell sent the result to deadlock and Aalto was saved as she had the higher public vote.  In week 3 she performed \"[[It's Oh So Quiet]]\" coming 2nd in the public vote, and in week 4 Aalto sang \"[[Bad Romance]]\", placing 3rd in the public vote. In week 5, Aalto finished in the bottom three for the third time alongside Sam Lavery and the group [[Four of Diamonds]], after her rendition of \"[[Sound of the Underground (song)|Sound of the Underground]]\". As Lavery was saved by Lifeline Vote, Aalto had to perform \"[[Who You Are (Jessie J song)|Who You Are]]\" in a sing-off against Four of Diamonds, and was saved with only Walsh voting to eliminate her.

As Lawrie was saved by Lifeline Vote, Aalto performed \"[[Run (Snow Patrol song)|Run]]\" in a sing-off against Parker. Walsh and Osbourne voted to eliminate Parker while Scherzinger and [[Simon Cowell]], who had the casting vote, voted to eliminate Aalto. This meant Cowell sent the result to deadlock and Aalto was saved as she had the higher public vote.  In week 3 she performed \"[[It's Oh So Quiet]]\" coming 2nd in the public vote, and in week 4 Aalto sang \"[[Bad Romance]]\", placing 3rd in the public vote.

It can be accessed from the east by road D40 which runs north-west from Durban-Corbi\u00e8res then turns left to enter the commune from the east.  The D40 continues west to the town of Albas then continues to the west through the heart of the commune and on to [[Villerouge-Termen\u00e8s]].  The commune can also be accessed from [[Cascastel-des-Corbi\u00e8res]] in the south-east by road D106 which runs north-west to the town of Albas. There are numerous countries roads criss-crossing the commune. The landscape is unusual with farmland along the east-west central axis of the commune but most of the commune is forested hills.<ref name=Google>[https://www.google.com/maps/place/Albas,+France/@43.004632,2.7327606,6665m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x12b037736354f011:0x4078821166d3390?hl=en Google Maps]</ref>\n\nThe village is built at an average altitude 270 metres, the town hall is 250m above sea level. There are no other villages or hamlets in the commune.\n\nThere are numerous streams densely covering the commune. Those in the north flow north to the Nielle river which eventually flows to the Orbieu which joins the Aude near Saint-Nazaire-d'Aude. Those in the south flow south to the Berre river which flows to the sea.<ref name=Google/>\n\n===Geology===\nThe commune is in the [[Corbi\u00e8res (mountains)|Corbi\u00e8res]] mountains at the foot of Mount Tauch in the Corbi\u00e8res [[Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e|AOC]].\n\nThe Albas [[sedimentary]] series has been the subject of numerous geological studies as the different layers extend from the [[Mesozoic]] to [[Quaternary]] periods and dinosaur fossil eggs have been found.

Extraction of Iron Ore was being done in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. The Romans named the place ''ALBARES'' probably because of the silver poplar leaves they found in the vicinity of the present village.\n\nIn a deed from the year 963 concerning donations from the nearby village of ''Fontjoncouse'' at Aymeric, the Archbishop of Narbonne, wrote the words ''VILLA ALBARES (ALBAS)''. In 1196, the [[Viscountess]]  [[Ermengarde, Viscountess of Narbonne|Ermengarde of Narbonne]] donated in her will the ''[[castrum]]'' or \"fortified place\" of ALBAS to a military order. His nephew Pierre de Lara, however, would not give any part of Albas to the [[Templars]] or the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Hospitallers]] orders. A ''Commander Saint Jean'' is mentioned at Albas in 1243. In 1226, ''Guillaume de Laroque de Carcassonne'' sold his possessions at Albas to the [[Abbey of Lagrasse]]. In the course of the 13th century, the [[Count of Foix]] was Lord then, in 1271, Aymeric, [[Viscount of Narbonne]] became the rightful lord of the ''Castrum of Albaribus Ferreriarum'' (the Albas Iron Mines).\n\nThe church is dedicated to Saint Paul, who evangelised in [[Gallia Narbonensis|Narbonne]].\n\nIn 1503 Jean de Cascastel of a neighbouring village was cited as lord. In 1523, Jean of Narbonne was said to hold the lordship of Albas from the King. During this century, ''Rogier de Lubes'', Bailiff of Albas, organized an intercommunal association to defend the interests of the people ruined by the [[French Wars of Religion|Franco-Spanish wars]]. The village built of [[adobe]] was destroyed and the residents resettled in the [[castrum]].\n\nIn 1576, the [[Parliament of Toulouse]] distributed the property of the ''Bellisens'' family and Albas went to ''Pons Thomas Joseph Davisard''. In the 17th  century, [[Cardinal Richelieu]] decided to reclaim the [[Roussillon]] and [[Narbonne]] became a stronghold at the disposal of the French. In an order dated 6 May 1642, [[Louis XII]] put Albas on the list of localities dependent on Narbonne. At the beginning of the 18th century, Albas was part of the barony of Talairan and came under the spiritual authority of the [[Order of Malta]]. This is why the current crest of Albas is a white Maltese cross on red background.\n\nDuring the [[French Revolution|Revolution]], the property of the ''Davisard'' family was confiscated and the Albas Iron Works became a commune. In 1830, the farming of [[Quercus coccifera|Garouille]] (a dwarf oak that provided [[vermilion]] dye) and charcoal production was the main economic activity of Albas, with alfalfa and livestock (goats for milk, sheep for meat, mules for travel). The iron mining which merely collected the unrefined ore (ferri\u00e8res) in the Middle Ages gave way at the beginning of the 20th century to mining on the Lacamp plateau. Iron was carried by trolleys and the small railway linking Durban-Corbi\u00e8res to Tuchan until 1930. The railway was abandoned in favour of the first trucks then the mines became too expensive to operate and they were abandoned in 1930. The mine shafts were closed and only a few insiders knew how to get in by entering discrete tunnels. The remains of a pink marble quarry can be seen on the road to Cascastel near the village.\n\n===Heraldry===\n{{Blazon-arms\n|img1=Blason ville fr Magrie (Aude).svg\n|legend1=Arms of Albas \n|text=\n\n'''Blazon:'''<br/>\n''Gules, a cross of Malta argent bordure Or.''\n}}\n\n==Administration==\n[[File:Albas, Mairie.jpg|thumb|The Town Hall]]\n\n'''List of Successive Mayors of Albas'''<ref>[http://www.francegenweb.org/mairesgenweb/resultcommune.php?id=12779 List of Mayors of France]</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Its official designation is '''Army Type 2 Single-Seat Fighter''' (\u4e8c\u5f0f\u5358\u5ea7\u6226\u95d8\u6a5f) and its [[World War II Allied names for Japanese aircraft|Allied reporting name]] was '''Tojo'''. \n\nThe design and development of the Ki-44 differed greatly to other Japanese fighters of the time, incorporating speed and [[Climb (aeronautics)|rate-of-climb]] in preference to maneuvrability.<ref name=\"millman\">{{cite book |last=Millman |first=Nicholas |author-link= |date=2011 |title=Ki-44 'Tojo' Aces of World War 2 |url= |location=Oxford, England |publisher=Osprey Publishing |page=1-8 |isbn=9781849084406}}</ref> This was a result of a need for a [[heavy fighter]] aircraft that followed a more offensive doctrine and the Ki-44 is often classified as an Air Defence Fighter.<ref name=\"millman\"/><ref name=\"Buechel\">{{cite book |last=Buechel |first=Richard M. |author-link= |date=1971 |title=Ki-44 Ia,b,c/IIa,b,c in Japanese Army Air force Service|url= |location=Berkshire, England |publisher=Osprey Publishing |page= |isbn=}}</ref> Its development ran almost in parallel to its predecessor, the lighter and nimble [[Nakajima Ki-43]], and yet the two aircraft differed. The Ki-44 had a higher landing speed and was less maneuverable. These were concerns for pilots who would compare it to the Ki-43 or [[Nakajima Ki-27|Ki-27]] which were far more agile and responsive. As a result, the Ki-44 was first restricted to pilots with at least 1000 hours of flying time due to its tricky handling characteristics. However, it was later found that younger pilots who had not been instilled with the extensive aerobatic training of earlier cadres could manage the aircraft perfectly well, so the restriction was removed.<ref name=\"millman\"/>\n\nNonetheless, the Ki-44 was the fastest climbing Japanese fighter at the time. While there was performance restrictions at high altitude, it was a useful [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 Superfortress]] interceptor and is commonly associated with Home Island defence operations.<ref name=\"millman\"/> It was superior to the Ki-43 in that it was capable of matching Allied aircraft in climbs and dives, giving pilots more flexibility in combat and greater pilot confidence than the Ki-43; the basic armament of four 12.7mm machine guns or two 12.7mm guns and two 20&nbsp;mm cannons (or, in a few aircraft, two [[Ho-301_cannon|Ho-301 40mm cannons]] of limited range) was far more powerful to the older Ki-43's two 12.7mm machine guns.<ref name=\"Ethell1995p101\">{{Harvnb|Ethell|1995|p=101.}}</ref><ref name=\"Ethell1995p100\">{{Harvnb|Ethell|1995|p=100.}}</ref> \n\nProduction of the Ki-44 would terminate in late 1944 in favour of the more advanced [[Nakajima Ki-84]], and when the war ended, only three [[Sentai]] units were still equipped with them.<ref name=\"Francillon, 1979, p. 221\">Francillon, 1979, p.221</ref> Despite more than 1,200 aircraft built, none have survived the war.\n\n== Design and development ==\n[[File:Ki-44 skeleton.jpg|thumb|A Ki-44 at the Tokorozawa Army Maintenance School.]]\nNakajima began development of the Ki-44 in 1940 as a pure [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] with emphasis being placed on airspeed and rate of climb rather than maneuverability. The Japanese Army Air Force specification called for a maximum speed of 600&nbsp;km/h (370&nbsp;mph) at 4,000&nbsp;m (13,130&nbsp;ft), to be attained in five minutes. A set of Ki-43-like \"butterfly\" combat [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] was fitted for improved maneuverability. Armament consisted of a pair of 7.7&nbsp;mm (.303&nbsp;in) and a pair of 12.7&nbsp;mm (.50&nbsp;in) [[machine gun]]s.\n\nThe engine selected for the new interceptor was Nakajima's Ha-41 (a development of the [[Nakajima Ha-5]]) 14-cylinder double-row [[Radial engine|radial]], originally intended for bomber aircraft. Although the Ha-41 was not the ideal choice due to its large-diameter cross section, the design team was able to marry this engine to a much smaller fuselage with a narrow cross section. At 1,260&nbsp;mm in diameter, the Ha-41 was 126&nbsp;mm larger in diameter than the 1,144&nbsp;mm [[Nakajima Sakae]] (used in the [[Mitsubishi A6M]] \"Zero\" and [[Nakajima Ki-43]] \"Hayabusa\"). However, the Sakae was only 27.8L in displacement and 1,000&nbsp;hp, while the Ha-41 was 37.5L and made 1,260&nbsp;hp (1,440 in the later Ha-109 version). In any case, since the Sakae wasn't powerful enough, the only alternative available was the Mitsubishi Kinsei, which was slightly smaller than the Ha-41 in diameter, five liters smaller in displacement, and was less powerful. Unfortunately, this was already in demand for many other aircraft, so the Ha-41 was chosen as the best powerplant. In order to achieve its design goals, the wing area was relatively small leading to a high [[wing loading]] and a comparatively high landing speed that could be daunting to the average Japanese pilot, who was more used to aircraft with a low wing loading like the Ki-44's predecessors, the Ki-43 and [[Nakajima Ki-27|Ki-27]].\n\nThe first Ki-44 [[prototype]] flew in August 1940 and the initial test flights were generally encouraging, with handling considered acceptable considering the high wing loading. Problems encountered included a high landing speed and poor forward visibility during taxiing due to the large radial engine.\n\nA second pre-production batch of 40 aircraft were ordered, which featured four 12.7mm machine guns, a relocated air cooler and main gear doors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Spick|first=Mike|title=Illustrated Directory of Fighters|year=2002|publisher=MBI Publishing|location=St Paul, USA|isbn=0-7603-1343-1|pages=481}}</ref>\n\n== Operational history ==\nThe Nakajima Ki-44 at one point equipped 12 ''[[sentai]]'' (\"[[group (air force)|groups]]/[[wing (air force)|wings]]\") of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force: ''9, 22, 23, 29, 47, 59, 64, 70, 85, 87, 104'' and ''246'' ''Sentai''. The [[Manchukuo Air Force]] also operated some Ki-44s.\n[[File:Wagner Book (15716772013).jpg|thumb|219x219px|Captured Ki-44]]\nPre-production Ki-44 aircraft and two of the prototypes were turned over to the Army for service trials on 15 September 1941. The type commenced operations when nine aircraft were received by an experimental unit, ''47th Chutai'' \"''Kawasemi Buntai''\" (\"Kingfisher [[flight (military unit)|Flight]], 47th Squadron\"), commanded by Major Toshio Sakagawa at [[Saigon]], Indochina in December 1941.\n\nThe Ki-44 also saw significant action with ''87th Sentai'' in the air defense role, while based at [[Palembang]], [[Sumatra]]. Other units equipped with the Ki-44 during the early part of the war were stationed in [[China]], [[Burma]], [[The Philippines]] and [[Korea]].\n\n[[File:Ki-44 (1).jpg|thumb|A Japanese Ki-44.]]\n\nLater in the war, the type saw action in an air defense role over the home islands \u2013 mainly around Japan's large industrial cities. ''47 Chutai'', after it was transferred to air defense roles in Japan, was expanded to become ''47 Sentai''.\n\nThe Ki-44-II ''Otsu'' (also known as the Ki-44-IIb) could be armed with a [[Ho-301]] 40&nbsp;mm autocannon. While this was a relatively high-caliber weapon, it used [[caseless ammunition]] with a low [[muzzle velocity]] and short range, which was effective only in close attacks. Some of these aircraft were used against USAAF bombers by a special ''Shinten Seiku Tai'' ([[air superiority]] unit), comprising at least four aircraft,<ref name=\"Bueschel1971overview Air Combat regiments\">{{Harvnb|Bueschel|1971|overview Air Combat regiments.}}</ref> that was part of ''47th Sentai'', based at [[Narimasu]] airfield in Tokyo. Pilots from such units attempted to shoot down B-29s and, once their ammunition was expended, to [[Aerial ramming|ram]] them \u2013 effectively a suicide attack. While the concept appeared straightforward, ramming a B-29 at high altitudes was difficult to achieve in practice.\n\nBy the end of the war, Ki-44 variants were being replaced by the [[Nakajima Ki-84]] ''Hayate'', which was regarded as vastly superior \u2013 in aspects other than maintenance and reliability. \n\nDuring 1946\u201349, both sides in the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Chinese Revolution]] operated Ki-44s surrendered or abandoned by Japanese units. Air units of the [[People's Liberation Army]] obtained aircraft formerly belonging to ''22'' and ''85 Sentai'', which had disbanded in [[Korea|Chosen]]. Some of these aircraft were reportedly flown by Japanese veterans. Within the [[Republic of China Air Force]] 18th Squadron (12th Fighter Group) was equipped with Ki-44s formerly of ''9th Sentai'', which had disbanded in Nanking, and ''29th Sentai'', which had disbanded at [[Taiwan|Formosa]] and they saw action in .<ref name=\"Bueschel1971overview Air Combat regiments\" /> Following the retreat of the Nationalists the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] (formed in 1949) used the Ki-44 until the early 1950s.\n\n=== Survivors ===\nNo complete surviving examples of the Ki-44 exist. However a wing center section is preserved at the [[Northwestern Polytechnical University]] Aviation Museum, at [[Xi'an]] in China.\n\n== Variants ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin-left: 8px;\"\n|- style=\"background: #eee;\"\n| colspan=\"4\"| '''Ki-44 Production: [[\u014cta, Gunma|Ota]] Aircraft Plant'''<ref>USSBS Report 17, Appendix M. p.40-42</ref><ref>USSBS Report 17, Appendix N. p.78</ref>\n|-\n| '''Year''' || '''Month''' || '''Aircraft<br> Produced''' || '''Government<br> Order'''\n|-\n| 1940 || August || 1 || pre-production<ref name=\"Francillon, 1979, p. 223\"/>\n|-\n| 1940 || September || 1 || pre-production<ref name=\"Francillon, 1979, p. 223\"/>\n|-\n| 1940 || October || 1 || pre-production<ref name=\"Francillon, 1979, p. 223\"/>\n|-\n| 1941 || June || 1 || \n|-\n| 1941 || July || 4 || \n|-\n| 1941 || August || 1 || \n|-\n|'''1940/1'''||'''Annual Production'''||'''9'''||'''9'''\n|-\n| 1942 || January || 1 || \n|-\n| 1942 || February || 4 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || March || 4 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || April || 5 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || May || 7 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || June || 5 || \n|-\n| 1942 || July || 3 || \n|-\n| 1942 || August || 13 || \n|-\n| 1942 || September || 12 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || October || 13 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || November || 34 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || December || 30 || \n|-\n|'''1942'''||'''Annual Production'''||'''131'''||'''168'''\n|-\n| 1943 || January || 30 ||\n|-\n| 1943 || February || 33 ||\n|-\n| 1943 || March || 42 ||\n|-\n| 1943 || April || 37 || \n|-\n| 1943 || May || 37 || \n|-\n| 1943 || June || 40 || \n|-\n| 1943 || July || 30 ||\n|-\n| 1943 || August || 51 ||\n|-\n| 1943 || September || 51 || \n|-\n| 1943 || October || 47 ||\n|-\n| 1943 || November || 56 || \n|-\n| 1943 || December || 65 || \n|-\n|'''1943'''||'''Annual Production'''||'''519'''||'''506'''\n|-\n| 1944 || January || 73 ||\n|-\n| 1944 || February || 54 ||\n|-\n| 1944 || March || 75 ||\n|-\n| 1944 || April || 85 || \n|-\n| 1944 || May || 72 || \n|-\n| 1944 || June || 65 || \n|-\n| 1944 || July || 39 ||\n|-\n| 1944 || August || 33 ||\n|-\n| 1944 || September || 29 || \n|-\n| 1944 || October || 22 ||\n|-\n| 1944 || November || 11 || \n|-\n| 1944 || December || 7 || \n|-\n| 1945 || January || 2 || \n|-\n|'''1944/5'''||'''Annual Production'''||'''567'''||'''543'''\n|-\n| '''Total''' || ||'''1223''' || '''1223'''\n|}\n;Ki-44: First prototype (s/n 4401) with Ha-41 engine with a complex cooling system, unique for the first prototype.\n;Ki-44: Nine pre-production aircraft (s/n 4402-4410), the first of which being quite different than the later ones.

Its official designation is '''Army Type 2 Single-Seat Fighter''' (\u4e8c\u5f0f\u5358\u5ea7\u6226\u95d8\u6a5f) and its [[World War II Allied names for Japanese aircraft|Allied reporting name]] was '''Tojo'''. \n\nThe design and development of the Ki-44 differed greatly to other Japanese fighters of the time, incorporating speed and [[Climb (aeronautics)|rate-of-climb]] in preference to maneuvrability.<ref name=\"millman\">{{cite book |last=Millman |first=Nicholas |author-link= |date=2011 |title=Ki-44 'Tojo' Aces of World War 2 |url= |location=Oxford, England |publisher=Osprey Publishing |page=1-8 |isbn=9781849084406}}</ref> This was a result of a need for a [[heavy fighter]] aircraft that followed a more offensive doctrine and the Ki-44 is often classified as an Air Defence Fighter.<ref name=\"millman\"/><ref name=\"Buechel\">{{cite book |last=Buechel |first=Richard M. |author-link= |date=1971 |title=Ki-44 Ia,b,c/IIa,b,c in Japanese Army Air force Service|url= |location=Berkshire, England |publisher=Osprey Publishing |page= |isbn=}}</ref> Its development ran almost in parallel to its predecessor, the lighter and nimble [[Nakajima Ki-43]], and yet the two aircraft differed. The Ki-44 had a higher landing speed and was less maneuverable. These were concerns for pilots who would compare it to the Ki-43 or [[Nakajima Ki-27|Ki-27]] which were far more agile and responsive. As a result, the Ki-44 was first restricted to pilots with at least 1000 hours of flying time due to its tricky handling characteristics. However, it was later found that younger pilots who had not been instilled with the extensive aerobatic training of earlier cadres could manage the aircraft perfectly well, so the restriction was removed.<ref name=\"millman\"/>\n\nNonetheless, the Ki-44 was the fastest climbing Japanese fighter at the time. While there was performance restrictions at high altitude, it was a useful [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 Superfortress]] interceptor and is commonly associated with Home Island defence operations.<ref name=\"millman\"/> It was superior to the Ki-43 in that it was capable of matching Allied aircraft in climbs and dives, giving pilots more flexibility in combat and greater pilot confidence than the Ki-43; the basic armament of four 12.7mm machine guns or two 12.7mm guns and two 20&nbsp;mm cannons (or, in a few aircraft, two [[Ho-301_cannon|Ho-301 40mm cannons]] of limited range) was far more powerful to the older Ki-43's two 12.7mm machine guns.<ref name=\"Ethell1995p101\">{{Harvnb|Ethell|1995|p=101.}}</ref><ref name=\"Ethell1995p100\">{{Harvnb|Ethell|1995|p=100.}}</ref> \n\nProduction of the Ki-44 would terminate in late 1944 in favour of the more advanced [[Nakajima Ki-84]], and when the war ended, only three [[Sentai]] units were still equipped with them.<ref name=\"Francillon, 1979, p. 221\">Francillon, 1979, p.221</ref> Despite more than 1,200 aircraft built, none have survived the war.\n\n== Design and development ==\n[[File:Ki-44 skeleton.jpg|thumb|A Ki-44 at the Tokorozawa Army Maintenance School.]]\nNakajima began development of the Ki-44 in 1940 as a pure [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] with emphasis being placed on airspeed and rate of climb rather than maneuverability. The Japanese Army Air Force specification called for a maximum speed of 600&nbsp;km/h (370&nbsp;mph) at 4,000&nbsp;m (13,130&nbsp;ft), to be attained in five minutes. A set of Ki-43-like \"butterfly\" combat [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] was fitted for improved maneuverability. Armament consisted of a pair of 7.7&nbsp;mm (.303&nbsp;in) and a pair of 12.7&nbsp;mm (.50&nbsp;in) [[machine gun]]s.\n\nThe engine selected for the new interceptor was Nakajima's Ha-41 (a development of the [[Nakajima Ha-5]]) 14-cylinder double-row [[Radial engine|radial]], originally intended for bomber aircraft. Although the Ha-41 was not the ideal choice due to its large-diameter cross section, the design team was able to marry this engine to a much smaller fuselage with a narrow cross section. At 1,260&nbsp;mm in diameter, the Ha-41 was 126&nbsp;mm larger in diameter than the 1,144&nbsp;mm [[Nakajima Sakae]] (used in the [[Mitsubishi A6M]] \"Zero\" and [[Nakajima Ki-43]] \"Hayabusa\"). However, the Sakae was only 27.8L in displacement and 1,000&nbsp;hp, while the Ha-41 was 37.5L and made 1,260&nbsp;hp (1,440 in the later Ha-109 version). In any case, since the Sakae wasn't powerful enough, the only alternative available was the Mitsubishi Kinsei, which was slightly smaller than the Ha-41 in diameter, five liters smaller in displacement, and was less powerful. Unfortunately, this was already in demand for many other aircraft, so the Ha-41 was chosen as the best powerplant. In order to achieve its design goals, the wing area was relatively small leading to a high [[wing loading]] and a comparatively high landing speed that could be daunting to the average Japanese pilot, who was more used to aircraft with a low wing loading like the Ki-44's predecessors, the Ki-43 and [[Nakajima Ki-27|Ki-27]].\n\nThe first Ki-44 [[prototype]] flew in August 1940 and the initial test flights were generally encouraging, with handling considered acceptable considering the high wing loading. Problems encountered included a high landing speed and poor forward visibility during taxiing due to the large radial engine.\n\nA second pre-production batch of 40 aircraft were ordered, which featured four 12.7mm machine guns, a relocated air cooler and main gear doors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Spick|first=Mike|title=Illustrated Directory of Fighters|year=2002|publisher=MBI Publishing|location=St Paul, USA|isbn=0-7603-1343-1|pages=481}}</ref>\n\n== Operational history ==\nThe Nakajima Ki-44 at one point equipped 12 ''[[sentai]]'' (\"[[group (air force)|groups]]/[[wing (air force)|wings]]\") of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force: ''9, 22, 23, 29, 47, 59, 64, 70, 85, 87, 104'' and ''246'' ''Sentai''. The [[Manchukuo Air Force]] also operated some Ki-44s.\n[[File:Wagner Book (15716772013).jpg|thumb|219x219px|Captured Ki-44]]\nPre-production Ki-44 aircraft and two of the prototypes were turned over to the Army for service trials on 15 September 1941. The type commenced operations when nine aircraft were received by an experimental unit, ''47th Chutai'' \"''Kawasemi Buntai''\" (\"Kingfisher [[flight (military unit)|Flight]], 47th Squadron\"), commanded by Major Toshio Sakagawa at [[Saigon]], Indochina in December 1941.\n\nThe Ki-44 also saw significant action with ''87th Sentai'' in the air defense role, while based at [[Palembang]], [[Sumatra]]. Other units equipped with the Ki-44 during the early part of the war were stationed in [[China]], [[Burma]], [[The Philippines]] and [[Korea]].\n\n[[File:Ki-44 (1).jpg|thumb|A Japanese Ki-44.]]\n\nLater in the war, the type saw action in an air defense role over the home islands \u2013 mainly around Japan's large industrial cities. ''47 Chutai'', after it was transferred to air defense roles in Japan, was expanded to become ''47 Sentai''.\n\nThe Ki-44-II ''Otsu'' (also known as the Ki-44-IIb) could be armed with a [[Ho-301]] 40&nbsp;mm autocannon. While this was a relatively high-caliber weapon, it used [[caseless ammunition]] with a low [[muzzle velocity]] and short range, which was effective only in close attacks. Some of these aircraft were used against USAAF bombers by a special ''Shinten Seiku Tai'' ([[air superiority]] unit), comprising at least four aircraft,<ref name=\"Bueschel1971overview Air Combat regiments\">{{Harvnb|Bueschel|1971|overview Air Combat regiments.}}</ref> that was part of ''47th Sentai'', based at [[Narimasu]] airfield in Tokyo. Pilots from such units attempted to shoot down B-29s and, once their ammunition was expended, to [[Aerial ramming|ram]] them \u2013 effectively a suicide attack. While the concept appeared straightforward, ramming a B-29 at high altitudes was difficult to achieve in practice.\n\nBy the end of the war, Ki-44 variants were being replaced by the [[Nakajima Ki-84]] ''Hayate'', which was regarded as vastly superior \u2013 in aspects other than maintenance and reliability. \n\nDuring 1946\u201349, both sides in the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Chinese Revolution]] operated Ki-44s surrendered or abandoned by Japanese units. Air units of the [[People's Liberation Army]] obtained aircraft formerly belonging to ''22'' and ''85 Sentai'', which had disbanded in [[Korea|Chosen]]. Some of these aircraft were reportedly flown by Japanese veterans. Within the [[Republic of China Air Force]] 18th Squadron (12th Fighter Group) was equipped with Ki-44s formerly of ''9th Sentai'', which had disbanded in Nanking, and ''29th Sentai'', which had disbanded at [[Taiwan|Formosa]] and they saw action in .<ref name=\"Bueschel1971overview Air Combat regiments\" /> Following the retreat of the Nationalists the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] (formed in 1949) used the Ki-44 until the early 1950s.\n\n=== Survivors ===\nNo complete surviving examples of the Ki-44 exist. However a wing center section is preserved at the [[Northwestern Polytechnical University]] Aviation Museum, at [[Xi'an]] in China.\n\n== Variants ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin-left: 8px;\"\n|- style=\"background: #eee;\"\n| colspan=\"4\"| '''Ki-44 Production: [[\u014cta, Gunma|Ota]] Aircraft Plant'''<ref>USSBS Report 17, Appendix M. p.40-42</ref><ref>USSBS Report 17, Appendix N. p.78</ref>\n|-\n| '''Year''' || '''Month''' || '''Aircraft<br> Produced''' || '''Government<br> Order'''\n|-\n| 1940 || August || 1 || pre-production<ref name=\"Francillon, 1979, p. 223\"/>\n|-\n| 1940 || September || 1 || pre-production<ref name=\"Francillon, 1979, p. 223\"/>\n|-\n| 1940 || October || 1 || pre-production<ref name=\"Francillon, 1979, p. 223\"/>\n|-\n| 1941 || June || 1 || \n|-\n| 1941 || July || 4 || \n|-\n| 1941 || August || 1 || \n|-\n|'''1940/1'''||'''Annual Production'''||'''9'''||'''9'''\n|-\n| 1942 || January || 1 || \n|-\n| 1942 || February || 4 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || March || 4 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || April || 5 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || May || 7 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || June || 5 || \n|-\n| 1942 || July || 3 || \n|-\n| 1942 || August || 13 || \n|-\n| 1942 || September || 12 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || October || 13 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || November || 34 ||\n|-\n| 1942 || December || 30 || \n|-\n|'''1942'''||'''Annual Production'''||'''131'''||'''168'''\n|-\n| 1943 || January || 30 ||\n|-\n| 1943 || February || 33 ||\n|-\n| 1943 || March || 42 ||\n|-\n| 1943 || April || 37 || \n|-\n| 1943 || May || 37 || \n|-\n| 1943 || June || 40 || \n|-\n| 1943 || July || 30 ||\n|-\n| 1943 || August || 51 ||\n|-\n| 1943 || September || 51 || \n|-\n| 1943 || October || 47 ||\n|-\n| 1943 || November || 56 || \n|-\n| 1943 || December || 65 || \n|-\n|'''1943'''||'''Annual Production'''||'''519'''||'''506'''\n|-\n| 1944 || January || 73 ||\n|-\n| 1944 || February || 54 ||\n|-\n| 1944 || March || 75 ||\n|-\n| 1944 || April || 85 || \n|-\n| 1944 || May || 72 || \n|-\n| 1944 || June || 65 || \n|-\n| 1944 || July || 39 ||\n|-\n| 1944 || August || 33 ||\n|-\n| 1944 || September || 29 || \n|-\n| 1944 || October || 22 ||\n|-\n| 1944 || November || 11 || \n|-\n| 1944 || December || 7 || \n|-\n| 1945 || January || 2 || \n|-\n|'''1944/5'''||'''Annual Production'''||'''567'''||'''543'''\n|-\n| '''Total''' || ||'''1223''' || '''1223'''\n|}\n;Ki-44: First prototype (s/n 4401) with Ha-41 engine with a complex cooling system, unique for the first prototype.\n;Ki-44: Nine pre-production aircraft (s/n 4402-4410), the first of which being quite different than the later ones.
