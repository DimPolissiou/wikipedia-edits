This account suggests new friends to Miles, people in his hometown of [[New York City]], who will require assistance. Initially skeptical, Miles decides to follow these suggestions to help people. His first suggestion had been a doctor who lost a patient and was on the verge of losing his girlfriend. While following up on his second suggestion, he meets and befriends Cara (Beane), a struggling magazine writer. Together with Cara and his [[hacker]] friend Rakesh (Sharma), Miles tries to find out who is behind the \"God\" account while still providing help to the account's continuing friend suggestions.  Miles' atheist views sometimes causes friction with his father (Morton), who is the pastor of an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church in [[Harlem]].\n\n==Use of Facebook==\n''God Friended Me'' uses [[Facebook]] frequently as a narrative device. The \"Friended\" in the title ''God Friended Me'' refers to the act of [[Friending and following|friending]] someone on social media, granting that person special privileges (on the service in question) with respect to oneself.{{sfn|Palfrey|Gasser|2010|p=25}} In ''God Friended Me'', this allows for God to contact Miles.\n\nWhile the majority of Facebook's revenue is advertisement-derived,<ref>{{cite web |author=Jolie O'Dell 203 |url=http://mashable.com/2011/01/17/facebooks-ad-revenue-hit-1-86b-for-2010/ |title=Facebook's Ad Revenue Hit $1.86B for 2010 |publisher=Mashable.com |date=January 17, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Womack |first=Brian |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-20/facebook-revenue-will-reach-4-27-billion-emarketer-says-1-.html |title=Facebook Revenue Will Reach $4.27 Billion, EMarketer Says |publisher=Bloomberg |date=September 20, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> show creator Steven Lilien says that their conversations with Facebook have been limited to discussing \"how much we can portray it.\"<ref name=\"Facebook\">{{cite web|author=Lisa de Moraes|url=https://deadline.com/2018/08/god-friended-me-not-highway-to-heaven-facebook-greg-berlanti-tca-1202440479/|title='God Friended Me' Is No 'Highway to Heaven' EPs Insist|date=August 5, 2018|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref> According to executive producer Bryan Wynbrandt, the \"God\" of the show will be active on Facebook outside the show, with liking pages and changing their [[Avatar (computing)|profile picture]] given as examples of their possible online activities.<ref name=\"Activity\">{{cite web|author=Tim Surette |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/god-friended-me-god-catholic-christian-cbs/|title=''God Friended Me'' Won't Just Be About One God|date=August 5, 2018|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n\n=== Main ===\n*[[Brandon Micheal Hall]]<ref name=\"order\" /> as Miles Finer, a skeptical atheist who hosts a podcast about his atheism.

Insisting that it's really God behind the account, Gideon said he was forced to choose between the account and starting a life with the woman he loves. He chose the latter, leaving one friend request five years ago that he never followed up on: Audrey Grenelle. Miles and Cara help Gideon close the book on his final friend request, while helping Audrey finally get past the family incident that changed her life. After a successful resolution, Gideon hints that Miles may be \"the prophet\" that the God account seeks, and if so, may be faced with a choice: continue his work with the account or have a life with Cara.

Despite Cara asking him to stay out of it, Miles implores Paul to do the right thing. After almost fleeing to Canada, Paul instead takes a plea deal that will result in him spending one to two years in prison. Cara accuses Miles of putting the God account before her, much like Gideon suggested might happen. Elsewhere, Arthur finds his new agenda being blocked by Reverend Elias, a very conservative member of his board who cites Arthur's children and out-of-wedlock relationship with Trish as reasons he should step down. Surprisingly, it's Trish who gets Arthur to stand up for what he believes is best for the church.

Despite wanting to walk away from the God account, Cara agrees to help when she learns a life is in danger, and she retrieves Miguel's wife to help talk him down. Miles insists that between his podcast and Cara's journalism outlets, they can raise the money to help Ava. However, Ava takes a turn for the worse and will need a kidney almost immediately, forcing Miles to come up with a creative solution. Miles had told Cara that Miguel will be his last friend suggestion, as he wants to choose her over the account. Seeing how Miles just effectively saved two lives, Cara insists she could never live with the thought that she prevented Miles from doing more good work, and she ends their relationship.

Now convinced that Alphonse is the source of the God account, Miles tries to win back Cara.

This account suggests new friends to Miles, people in his hometown of [[New York City]], who will require assistance. Initially skeptical, Miles decides to follow these suggestions to help people. His first suggestion had been a doctor who lost a patient and was on the verge of losing his girlfriend. While following up on his second suggestion, he meets and befriends Cara (Beane), a struggling magazine writer. Together with Cara and his [[hacker]] friend Rakesh (Sharma), Miles tries to find out who is behind the \"God\" account while still providing help to the account's continuing friend suggestions.  Miles' atheist views sometimes causes friction with his father (Morton), who is the pastor of an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church in [[Harlem]].\n\n==Use of Facebook==\n''God Friended Me'' uses [[Facebook]] frequently as a narrative device. The \"Friended\" in the title ''God Friended Me'' refers to the act of [[Friending and following|friending]] someone on social media, granting that person special privileges (on the service in question) with respect to oneself.{{sfn|Palfrey|Gasser|2010|p=25}} In ''God Friended Me'', this allows for God to contact Miles.\n\nWhile the majority of Facebook's revenue is advertisement-derived,<ref>{{cite web |author=Jolie O'Dell 203 |url=http://mashable.com/2011/01/17/facebooks-ad-revenue-hit-1-86b-for-2010/ |title=Facebook's Ad Revenue Hit $1.86B for 2010 |publisher=Mashable.com |date=January 17, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Womack |first=Brian |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-20/facebook-revenue-will-reach-4-27-billion-emarketer-says-1-.html |title=Facebook Revenue Will Reach $4.27 Billion, EMarketer Says |publisher=Bloomberg |date=September 20, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> show creator Steven Lilien says that their conversations with Facebook have been limited to discussing \"how much we can portray it.\"<ref name=\"Facebook\">{{cite web|author=Lisa de Moraes|url=https://deadline.com/2018/08/god-friended-me-not-highway-to-heaven-facebook-greg-berlanti-tca-1202440479/|title='God Friended Me' Is No 'Highway to Heaven' EPs Insist|date=August 5, 2018|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref> According to executive producer Bryan Wynbrandt, the \"God\" of the show will be active on Facebook outside the show, with liking pages and changing their [[Avatar (computing)|profile picture]] given as examples of their possible online activities.<ref name=\"Activity\">{{cite web|author=Tim Surette |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/god-friended-me-god-catholic-christian-cbs/|title=''God Friended Me'' Won't Just Be About One God|date=August 5, 2018|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n\n=== Main ===\n*[[Brandon Micheal Hall]]<ref name=\"order\" /> as Miles Finer, a skeptical atheist who hosts a podcast about his atheism.

Meanwhile, Rakesh breaks the God account's encryption with Cara's help, and they learn about a particular train leaving Grand Central Station later that night.

Despite wanting to walk away from the God account, Cara agrees to help when she learns a life is in danger, and she retrieves Miguel's wife to help talk him down. Miles insists that between his podcast and Cara's journalism outlets, they can raise the money to help Ava. However, Ava takes a turn for the worse and will need a kidney almost immediately, forcing Miles to come up with a creative solution. Miles had told Cara that Miguel will be his last friend suggestion, as he wants to choose her over the account. Seeing how Miles just effectively saved two lives, Cara insists she could never live with the thought that she prevented Miles from doing more good work, and she ends their relationship. Elsewhere, Arthur makes good on his promise to balance church duties with spending time with Trish, causing Trish to say she wants to marry him as soon as possible.

The hacker reveals he was hired by a man named Alphonse Jeffries to create the back door. While Rakesh tracks down that lead, Miles and Joy help an elderly holocaust survivor named Abe ([[Judd Hirsch]]), who noticed his father's gold watch on a jewelry auction site and hopes it can lead him to answers about his long-lost sister, Rose. Soon after a successful resolution of that case, Miles learns that Alphonse and Arthur served in Vietnam together and, in fact, Arthur saved Alphonse's life. Having revealed that he and Trish are getting married that weekend, Arthur says he invited Alphonse to the wedding. Now convinced that Alphonse is the source of the God account, Miles tries to win back Cara.
