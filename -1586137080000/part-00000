The courses are voted on by a panel of several hundred golf experts. The magazine also produces lists of the best new courses, the best golf resorts, the best courses in each U.S. state and best American golf courses for women. Before the \"Greatest\" rankings were introduced in 1985, ''Golf Digest'' produced lists called at different times ''America's 100 Most Testing Courses'' and ''America's 100 Greatest Tests of Golf''.\n\nThe top ten on the 2019-2020 list are as follows:<ref>[https://www.golfdigest.com/gallery/americas-100-greatest-golf-courses-ranking] Golf Digest, America's 100 Greatest Golf Courses, January 2019</ref>\n\n# [[Pine Valley Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Pine Valley, New Jersey]]\n# [[Augusta National Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Augusta, Georgia]]  \n# [[Cypress Point Club]] \u2013 [[Pebble Beach, California]]\t\t\t\n# [[Shinnecock Hills Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Southampton (town), New York|Southampton, New York]] \t\t\t\n# [[Oakmont Country Club]] \u2013 [[Oakmont, Pennsylvania]] \n# [[Merion Golf Club]] (East Course) \u2013 [[Ardmore, Pennsylvania]]\t\t\n# [[Pebble Beach Golf Links]] \u2013 [[Pebble Beach, California]]\t\t\n# [[National Golf Links of America]] \u2013 [[Southampton (town), New York|Southampton, New York]]\n# [[Sand Hills Golf Club]] - [[Mullen, Nebraska]]\n# [[Fishers Island Club]] \u2013 [[Fishers Island, New York]]  \t\t\n\nThe top ten on the 2009\u201310 list were as follows:<ref>[http://www.golfdigest.com/rankings/courses/greatest/2009/05/100_greatestgolfcourses America's 100 Greatest Golf Courses/2009-10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902064108/http://www.golfdigest.com/rankings/courses/greatest/2009/05/100_greatestgolfcourses |date=2009-09-02 }}, ''Golf Digest, Accessed April 8, 2009</ref>\n \n# [[Augusta National Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Augusta, Georgia]] \t\t\n# [[Pine Valley Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Pine Valley, New Jersey]]\t\n# [[Shinnecock Hills Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Southampton (town), New York|Southampton, New York]] \t\t\n# [[Cypress Point Club]] \u2013 [[Pebble Beach, California]]\t\t\n# [[Oakmont Country Club]] \u2013 [[Oakmont, Pennsylvania]] \t\t\n# [[Pebble Beach Golf Links]] \u2013 [[Pebble Beach, California]]\t\t\n# [[Merion Golf Club]] (East Course) \u2013 [[Ardmore, Pennsylvania]]\t\n# [[Winged Foot Golf Club]] (West Course) \u2013 [[Mamaroneck (town), New York|Mamaroneck, New York]]\t\t\n# [[Fishers Island Club]] \u2013 [[Fishers Island, New York]]  \t\t\n# [[Seminole Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Juno Beach, Florida]]\t\n\nThe top ten on the 2007\u201308 list, published in May 2007, were as follows:\n\n#[[Pine Valley Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Pine Valley, New Jersey]]\n#[[Shinnecock Hills Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Southampton (town), New York|Southampton, New York]] \n#[[Augusta National Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Augusta, Georgia]] \n#[[Cypress Point Club]] \u2013 [[Pebble Beach, California]]\n#[[Oakmont Country Club]] \u2013 [[Oakmont, Pennsylvania]] \n#[[Pebble Beach Golf Links]] \u2013 [[Pebble Beach, California]]\n#[[Merion Golf Club]] (East Course) \u2013 [[Ardmore, Pennsylvania]] \n#[[Winged Foot Golf Club]] (West Course) \u2013 [[Mamaroneck (town), New York|Mamaroneck, New York]]\n#[[Seminole Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Juno Beach, Florida]]\n#[[Crystal Downs Country Club]] \u2013 [[Frankfort, Michigan]]\n\n==\"America's Top 50 Courses for Women\"==\nIn 2010 ''Golf Digest'' produced its inaugural ranking of \"America's Top 50 Courses for Women\". In creating the ranking, the magazine used nominations and evaluations by its panel of over 100 female raters as well as the woman-friendly criteria established by the editors. Those criteria included: at least one tee less than 5,300 yards; at least two sets of tees with USGA slope and course ratings for women; run-up areas to most or all greens and minimal forced carries for those playing from the forward tees.<ref>[https://www.golfdigest.com/story/golf_top_50_for_women] Golf Digest, America's Top 50 Courses for Women, January 5, 2010</ref>\n\nThe top ten on the 2013 list are as follows:<ref>[https://www.golfdigest.com/story/top-50-courses-for-women-2013-07] Golf Digest, America's Top 50 Courses for Women, July 2013</ref>\n\n# [[Pine Valley Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Pine Valley, New Jersey]]\n# [[Sea Island Golf Club]] \u2013 [[St. Simons, Georgia]]\n# [[The Boulders Resort and Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Carefree, Arizona]]\n# [[Bandon Dunes Golf Resort]] (Old MacDonald)\u2013 [[Bandon, Oregon]]\n# [[Running Y Ranch]] \u2013 [[Klamath Falls, Oregon]]\n# [[Omni Amelia Island Plantation Resort]] (Ocean Links) - [[Amelia Island, Florida]]\n# [[LPGA International]] (Champions) - [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]\n# [[Rope Rider Golf Course]] at [[Suncadia Resort]] - [[Cle Elum, Washington]]\n# [[Keystone Resort]] (River) - [[Keystone, Colorado]]\n# [[Grand Cypress Golf Club]] (East/North) - [[Orlando, Florida]]\n\n==\"America's 100 Greatest Public Golf Courses\"==\n{{Time-context|section|over six years out of date|date=February 2015}}\nAlongside the \"100 Greatest Courses\" ranking, and using the same methodology, ''Golf Digest'' publishes a list of \"America's 100 Greatest Public Golf Courses\". In this context, \"public\" means a golf course that is open to play by the public, as opposed to a private club\u2014not necessarily a course operated by a governmental entity.\n\nThe top ten on the 2007\u201308 list, also published in May 2007, was as follows:\n\n#[[Pebble Beach Golf Links]] \u2013 [[Pebble Beach, California]]\n#[[Bandon Dunes Golf Resort|Pacific Dunes Golf Course]] \u2013 [[Bandon, Oregon]]\n#[[Pinehurst Resort|Pinehurst No. 2]] \u2013 [[Pinehurst, North Carolina]] \n#[[Whistling Straits|The Straits Course, Whistling Straits]] \u2013 [[Haven, Wisconsin]] \n#[[Bethpage Black Course]] \u2013 [[Farmingdale, New York]]\n#[[Shadow Creek Golf Course]] \u2013 [[North Las Vegas, Nevada]] \n#[[Bandon Dunes Golf Resort|Bandon Dunes Golf Course]] \u2013 [[Bandon, Oregon]]\n#[[Kiawah Island Golf Resort|The Ocean Course at Kiawah Island]] \u2013 [[Kiawah Island, South Carolina]]\n#[[Prince Golf Course]] \u2013 [[Princeville, Hawaii|Princeville, Hawai{{okina}}i]]\n#[[Arcadia Bluffs Golf Course]] \u2013 [[Arcadia, Michigan]]\n\nOf these courses, the only one that is operated by a governmental entity is Bethpage Black.\n\nIn addition to its national rankings, ''Golf Digest'' also ranks courses at a state level.  For example, in a 1998 survey of Connecticut Public Golf Courses, ''Golf Digest'' ranked [[Crestbrook park golf course|Crestbrook Park Golf Course]] as one of Connecticut's top public golf courses.\n\n==\"100 Best Golf Courses Outside the United States\"==\n{{Time-context|section|over seven years out of date|date=February 2015}}\nThe magazine also compiles a list of the leading courses outside the United States.

The courses are voted on by a panel of several hundred golf experts. The magazine also produces lists of the best new courses, the best golf resorts, the best courses in each U.S. state and best American golf courses for women. Before the \"Greatest\" rankings were introduced in 1985, ''Golf Digest'' produced lists called at different times ''America's 100 Most Testing Courses'' and ''America's 100 Greatest Tests of Golf''.\n\nThe top ten on the 2019-2020 list are as follows:<ref>[https://www.golfdigest.com/gallery/americas-100-greatest-golf-courses-ranking] Golf Digest, America's 100 Greatest Golf Courses, January 2019</ref>\n\n# [[Pine Valley Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Pine Valley, New Jersey]]\n# [[Augusta National Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Augusta, Georgia]]  \n# [[Cypress Point Club]] \u2013 [[Pebble Beach, California]]\t\t\t\n# [[Shinnecock Hills Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Southampton (town), New York|Southampton, New York]] \t\t\t\n# [[Oakmont Country Club]] \u2013 [[Oakmont, Pennsylvania]] \n# [[Merion Golf Club]] (East Course) \u2013 [[Ardmore, Pennsylvania]]\t\t\n# [[Pebble Beach Golf Links]] \u2013 [[Pebble Beach, California]]\t\t\n# [[National Golf Links of America]] \u2013 [[Southampton (town), New York|Southampton, New York]]\n# [[Sand Hills Golf Club]] - [[Mullen, Nebraska]]\n# [[Fishers Island Club]] \u2013 [[Fishers Island, New York]]  \t\t\n\nThe top ten on the 2009\u201310 list were as follows:<ref>[http://www.golfdigest.com/rankings/courses/greatest/2009/05/100_greatestgolfcourses America's 100 Greatest Golf Courses/2009-10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902064108/http://www.golfdigest.com/rankings/courses/greatest/2009/05/100_greatestgolfcourses |date=2009-09-02 }}, ''Golf Digest, Accessed April 8, 2009</ref>\n \n# [[Augusta National Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Augusta, Georgia]] \t\t\n# [[Pine Valley Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Pine Valley, New Jersey]]\t\n# [[Shinnecock Hills Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Southampton (town), New York|Southampton, New York]] \t\t\n# [[Cypress Point Club]] \u2013 [[Pebble Beach, California]]\t\t\n# [[Oakmont Country Club]] \u2013 [[Oakmont, Pennsylvania]] \t\t\n# [[Pebble Beach Golf Links]] \u2013 [[Pebble Beach, California]]\t\t\n# [[Merion Golf Club]] (East Course) \u2013 [[Ardmore, Pennsylvania]]\t\n# [[Winged Foot Golf Club]] (West Course) \u2013 [[Mamaroneck (town), New York|Mamaroneck, New York]]\t\t\n# [[Fishers Island Club]] \u2013 [[Fishers Island, New York]]  \t\t\n# [[Seminole Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Juno Beach, Florida]]\t\n\nThe top ten on the 2007\u201308 list, published in May 2007, were as follows:\n\n#[[Pine Valley Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Pine Valley, New Jersey]]\n#[[Shinnecock Hills Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Southampton (town), New York|Southampton, New York]] \n#[[Augusta National Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Augusta, Georgia]] \n#[[Cypress Point Club]] \u2013 [[Pebble Beach, California]]\n#[[Oakmont Country Club]] \u2013 [[Oakmont, Pennsylvania]] \n#[[Pebble Beach Golf Links]] \u2013 [[Pebble Beach, California]]\n#[[Merion Golf Club]] (East Course) \u2013 [[Ardmore, Pennsylvania]] \n#[[Winged Foot Golf Club]] (West Course) \u2013 [[Mamaroneck (town), New York|Mamaroneck, New York]]\n#[[Seminole Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Juno Beach, Florida]]\n#[[Crystal Downs Country Club]] \u2013 [[Frankfort, Michigan]]\n\n==\"America's Top 50 Courses for Women\"==\nIn 2010 ''Golf Digest'' produced its inaugural ranking of \"America's Top 50 Courses for Women\". In creating the ranking, the magazine used nominations and evaluations by its panel of over 100 female raters as well as the woman-friendly criteria established by the editors. Those criteria included: at least one tee less than 5,300 yards; at least two sets of tees with USGA slope and course ratings for women; run-up areas to most or all greens and minimal forced carries for those playing from the forward tees.<ref>[https://www.golfdigest.com/story/golf_top_50_for_women] Golf Digest, America's Top 50 Courses for Women, January 5, 2010</ref>\n\nThe top ten on the 2013 list are as follows:<ref>[https://www.golfdigest.com/story/top-50-courses-for-women-2013-07] Golf Digest, America's Top 50 Courses for Women, July 2013</ref>\n\n# [[Pine Valley Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Pine Valley, New Jersey]]\n# [[Sea Island Golf Club]] \u2013 [[St. Simons, Georgia]]\n# [[The Boulders Resort and Golf Club]] \u2013 [[Carefree, Arizona]]\n# [[Bandon Dunes Golf Resort]] (Old MacDonald)\u2013 [[Bandon, Oregon]]\n# [[Running Y Ranch]] \u2013 [[Klamath Falls, Oregon]]\n# [[Omni Amelia Island Plantation Resort]] (Ocean Links) - [[Amelia Island, Florida]]\n# [[LPGA International]] (Champions) - [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]\n# [[Rope Rider Golf Course]] at [[Suncadia Resort]] - [[Cle Elum, Washington]]\n# [[Keystone Resort]] (River) - [[Keystone, Colorado]]\n# [[Grand Cypress Golf Club]] (East/North) - [[Orlando, Florida]]\n\n==\"America's 100 Greatest Public Golf Courses\"==\n{{Time-context|section|over six years out of date|date=February 2015}}\nAlongside the \"100 Greatest Courses\" ranking, and using the same methodology, ''Golf Digest'' publishes a list of \"America's 100 Greatest Public Golf Courses\". In this context, \"public\" means a golf course that is open to play by the public, as opposed to a private club\u2014not necessarily a course operated by a governmental entity.\n\nThe top ten on the 2007\u201308 list, also published in May 2007, was as follows:\n\n#[[Pebble Beach Golf Links]] \u2013 [[Pebble Beach, California]]\n#[[Bandon Dunes Golf Resort|Pacific Dunes Golf Course]] \u2013 [[Bandon, Oregon]]\n#[[Pinehurst Resort|Pinehurst No. 2]] \u2013 [[Pinehurst, North Carolina]] \n#[[Whistling Straits|The Straits Course, Whistling Straits]] \u2013 [[Haven, Wisconsin]] \n#[[Bethpage Black Course]] \u2013 [[Farmingdale, New York]]\n#[[Shadow Creek Golf Course]] \u2013 [[North Las Vegas, Nevada]] \n#[[Bandon Dunes Golf Resort|Bandon Dunes Golf Course]] \u2013 [[Bandon, Oregon]]\n#[[Kiawah Island Golf Resort|The Ocean Course at Kiawah Island]] \u2013 [[Kiawah Island, South Carolina]]\n#[[Prince Golf Course]] \u2013 [[Princeville, Hawaii|Princeville, Hawai{{okina}}i]]\n#[[Arcadia Bluffs Golf Course]] \u2013 [[Arcadia, Michigan]]\n\nOf these courses, the only one that is operated by a governmental entity is Bethpage Black.\n\nIn addition to its national rankings, ''Golf Digest'' also ranks courses at a state level.  For example, in a 1998 survey of Connecticut Public Golf Courses, ''Golf Digest'' ranked [[Crestbrook park golf course|Crestbrook Park Golf Course]] as one of Connecticut's top public golf courses.\n\n==\"100 Best Golf Courses Outside the United States\"==\n{{Time-context|section|over seven years out of date|date=February 2015}}\nThe magazine also compiles a list of the leading courses outside the United States.

[[Legislative power]] is vested in the [[National Assembly of Vietnam]] ({{lang-vi| Qu\u1ed1c h\u1ed9i Vi\u1ec7t Nam}}). The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive. The parliament adopted the current [[Constitution of Vietnam]], its fifth, on 28 November 2013.\n\nThe  President ({{lang|vi|Ch\u1ee7 t\u1ecbch n\u01b0\u1edbc}}) is elected by National Assembly for a five-year term and acts as the [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Vietnam People's Armed Forces]] and Chairman of the Council for Defence and Security. Moreover, the president has the right to decide on executive brands. The [[Government of Vietnam|government]] ({{lang|vi|Ch\u00ednh ph\u1ee7}}), the main executive state power of Vietnam, is headed by the Prime Minister, who has several Deputy Prime Ministers and several ministers in charge of particular activities. The executive branch is responsible for the implementation of political, economic, cultural, social, national defence, security and external activities of the state. The National Assembly is a [[unicameral]] legislative body. The National Assembly has 500 members, elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. The legislature is, according to the constitution, the highest organ of the state. Its powers includes the enactment and amendment of the constitution and laws; the adoption of the [[government budget]]; supervising the Government of Vietnam and other holders of public powers [[Responsible government|responsible]] to the National Assembly; and appointing members of the judiciary. The Vietnamese constitution and legislation provide for regular elections for the office of the President of the Socialist Republic, the National Assembly and the [[People's Council (Vietnam)|People's Councils]].\n\nVietnam has a judicial system governed by the Constitution of Vietnam and national legislation enacted by National Assembly. The [[Supreme People's Court of Vietnam|Supreme People's Court]] ({{lang|vi|T\u00f2a \u00e1n Nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n T\u1ed1i cao}}) is the highest court of appeal in Vietnam. There are other specialised courts in Vietnam, including the Central Military Court, the Criminal Court, the Civil Court and the Appeal Court. The [[Supreme People's Procuracy of Vietnam|Supreme People's Procuracy]] observes the implementation of state organs and makes sure that Vietnamese citizens follow the law.\n[[File:Political Structure in Vietnam.png|thumb|Political Structure in Vietnam]]\n\n==Legal framework==\n{{main|Constitution of Vietnam}}\nVietnam is a [[One-party state|one-party]] [[Socialist state|socialist republic]].<ref name=\"preambleoftheconstitution\">{{cite web | title = Preamble of the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam | publisher = [[Government of Vietnam|Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] | url = http://www.chinhphu.vn/portal/page/portal/English/TheSocialistRepublicOfVietnam/AboutVietnam/AboutVietnamDetail?categoryId=10000103&articleId=10001012 | accessdate =20 April 2012}}</ref> The current Vietnamese state traces its direct lineage back to the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] (North Vietnam) and the [[August Revolution|1945 August Revolution]] led by [[Ho Chi Minh|H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh]]. The current constitution was adopted on 28 November 2013 by the [[National Assembly of Vietnam]]. There have been four other constitutions in Vietnamese history: the 1946, 1959, 1980, and 1992 constitutions. The [[Communist Party of Vietnam]], the leading non-State organ, operates in accordance with the laws. Government powers in Vietnam are divided into legislative, executive and judiciary powers.

[[Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Chinh]]'s biography of \"Chairman H\u1ed3\" in 1973 emphasised his revolutionary policies. The thoughts of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh were systematised in 1989, under the leadership of [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Linh]].{{sfn|Quinn-Judge|2002|p=2}} H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh Thought, alongside Marxism\u2013Leninism, became the official ideology of the CPV and the state in 1991.{{sfn|Gillespie|2006|p=90}} The CPV's claim to legitimacy was retained following the [[collapse of communism]] in 1989 and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 by its commitment to the thoughts of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, according to Sophie Quinn-Judge.{{sfn|Quinn-Judge|2002|p=256}} According to Pierre Brocheux, the author of ''Ho Chi Minh: a Biography'', the current state ideology is H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh Thought, with Marxism\u2013Leninism playing a secondary role.{{sfn|Brocheux|2007|p=186}} While some claim that H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh Thought is used as a veil for the Party leadership since they, according to this version, have stopped believing in [[communism]], this is false when considering that H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh was an avid supporter of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. Others see H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh Thought as a political umbrella term whose main function is to smuggle in non-socialist ideas and policies without challenging socialist legality.{{sfn|Gillespie|2006|p=90}}\n\nSince its foundation, the key ideology has been Marxism\u2013Leninism, but since the introduction of a [[mixed economy]] in the late 1980s and 1990s, it has lost its monopolistic ideological and moral legitimacy.{{sfn|Gillespie|2006|p=91}} Marxism\u2013Leninism, which is a class-based ideology, lost its legitimacy because of the mixed economy. As became clear because of the [[\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi]] reforms, the Party could not base its rule on defending only the workers and the peasants, which was officially referred to as the \"working class-peasant alliance\".{{sfn|Gillespie|2006|p=92}} In the constitution introduced in 1992, the State represented the \"workers, peasants and intellectuals\".{{sfn|Gillespie|2006|p=91}} In recent years, the Party has stopped representing a specific class, but instead the \"interests of the entire people\", which includes entrepreneurs.{{sfn|Gillespie|2006|p=91}} The final class barrier was removed in 2002, when party members were allowed to engage in private activities. In the face of de-emphasising the role of Marxism\u2013Leninism, the Party has acquired a broader ideology, placing more emphasis on [[nationalism]], [[developmentalism]], and becoming the protector of tradition.{{sfn|Gillespie|2006|pp=91\u201392}}\n\n==Communist Party of Vietnam==\n{{main|Communist Party of Vietnam}}\n[[File:Flag of the Communist Party of Vietnam.svg|thumb|The flag of the Communist Party of Vietnam]]\nAccording to the official version, the Communist Party of Vietnam ({{lang-vi|\u0110\u1ea3ng C\u1ed9ng s\u1ea3n Vi\u1ec7t Nam}}) is leading the Vietnamese people \"in carrying out the country's renovation, modernisation and industrialisation.\"<ref name=\"Politicalsystem\"/> According to the Party's statute, amended at the [[9th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam|9th National Congress]] on 22 April 2001, the CPV was \"established and trained by President H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, has led the Vietnamese people to carry out successfully the August Revolution, establishing the Democratic Republic of Vi\u1ec7t Nam, now the Socialist Republic of Vi\u1ec7t Nam, to defeat foreign invaders, to abolish the colonial and feudalist regime, to liberate and reunify the country, and then carry out the cause of renovation and socialist construction and firmly defend national independence.\"<ref name=\"Politicalsystem\"/> It believes in [[socialist internationalism]] of the [[working class]], and supports the \"struggle for peace, national independence, democracy and social progress of the world's people.\"<ref name=\"Politicalsystem\"/> The CPV acts as the vanguard of the working people and the whole nation by representing their interests. Its aim is to create \"a strong, independent, prosperous and democratic country with an equitable and civilized society, to realise [[Socialism (marxism)|socialism]] and ultimately, communism.\" The Party's ideological foundation is Marxism\u2013Leninism and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh Thoughts. These ideologies guide the activities of the Party, while promoting \"the nation's traditions, and absorbing other nations' essential ideas.\"<ref name=\"Politicalsystem\"/>\n\nThe CPV is organised on the principles of [[democratic centralism]]. It practices \"criticism, self-criticism, and strict discipline\" and pursues \"[[collective leadership]] and individual responsibility, and promoting comradeship and solidarity in line with the Party's political programs and statutes.\"<ref name=\"Politicalsystem\"/> The CPV is subject to Vietnamese laws and the Constitution. It is the country's ruling party and promotes the \"[[L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n#Ideological beliefs|mastery of the people over the country]]\". The Party is under the supervision of the people. It is dependent on having the people contribute to the party, by strengthening, uniting, and leading the people in the [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary cause]]. The political system in Vietnam is led by the CPV, and it \"leads, respects and promotes the role of the State, the [[Vietnamese Fatherland Front]] (VFF) and other socio-political organisations.\"<ref name=\"Politicalsystem\"/>\n\n===Congress===\n{{Main|National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam}}\nThe National Congress is the party's highest organ.{{sfn|Van|Cooper|1983|p=56}} The direction of the Party and the Government is decided at the National Congress, held every fifth year. The Central Committee is elected by the National Congress.{{sfn|Ashwill|Thai|2005|p=47}} Delegates vote on policies and candidate posts within the central party leadership. Following ratification of the decisions taken at the National Congress, the National Congress dissolves itself. The Central Committee, which is elected by the National Congress every fifth year, implements the decisions of the National Congress in the five-year period. Since the Central Committee only meets twice a year, the Politburo implements the policies of the National Congress.{{sfn|Van|Cooper|1983|p=56}}\n\n===Central Committee===\n[[File:HoChiMinhCity01c.jpg|thumb| [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] billboard marking the 30th anniversary of the reunification of the country in 1975]]\n{{main|Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam}}\nThe Central Committee (CC) is the CPV's most powerful institution.{{sfn|East|Thomas|2003|p=574}} It delegates some of its powers to the [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of Vietnam|Secretariat]] and the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of Vietnam|Politburo]] when it is not in session.{{sfn|Rowley|2008|p=187}} When the [[Vietnam War]] ended in 1975, the Vietnamese leadership, led by [[L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n]], began to centralise power. This policy continued until the [[6th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam|6th National Congress]], when [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Linh]] took power. Linh pursued a policy of economic and political decentralisation.<ref>{{cite web |author=Abuza, Zachary|title=The Lessons of Le Kha Phieu: Changing Rules in Vietnamese politics|date=16 November 2001|publisher=Vietnamese Professionals of America. [[The Catholic University of America]]|page=9}}</ref> The party and state bureaucracy opposed Linh's reform initiatives; because of this, Linh tried to win the support of provincial leaders. This caused the powers of the provincial chapters of the CPV to increase in the 1990s. The CPV lost its power to appoint or dismiss provincial-level officials in the 1990s; this is proven by the fact that [[V\u00f5 V\u0103n Ki\u1ec7t]] tried to wrestle this power back to the centre during the 1990s without success. These developments led to the provincialisation of the Central Committee; for example, more and more CC members have a background in provincial party work. Because of these changes, power in Vietnam has become increasingly devolved.<ref>{{cite web |author=Abuza, Zachary|title=The Lessons of Le Kha Phieu: Changing Rules in Vietnamese politics|date=16 November 2001|publisher=Vietnamese Professionals of America. [[The Catholic University of America]] |page=10}}</ref> The number of Central Committee members with a provincial background increased from a low of 15.6 percent in 1982 to a high of 41 percent in 2000. The former [[President of Vietnam|President of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] [[Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng T\u1ea5n Sang]] (2001-2016) was directly elected from the provinces at the [[8th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam|8th Party Congress]], held in 1996.<ref>{{cite web |author=Abuza, Zachary|title=The Lessons of Le Kha Phieu: Changing Rules in Vietnamese politics|date=16 November 2001|publisher=Vietnamese Professionals of America. [[The Catholic University of America]]|page=11}}</ref> Because of the devolution of power, the powers of the Central Committee have increased substantially; for instance, when a two-thirds majority of the Politburo voted in favour of retaining [[L\u00ea Kh\u1ea3 Phi\u00eau]] as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam|General Secretary]] (the leader of Vietnam), the Central Committee voted against the Politburo's motion and voted unanimously in favour of removing L\u00ea Kh\u1ea3 Phi\u00eau from his post of General Secretary.<ref>{{cite web |author=Abuza, Zachary|title=The Lessons of Le Kha Phieu: Changing Rules in Vietnamese politics|date=16 November 2001|publisher=Vietnamese Professionals of America. [[The Catholic University of America]]|page=12}}</ref> The Central Committee did this because the majority of its members were of provincial background, or were working in the provinces; because of this, these members were the first to feel the pinch when the economy began to stagnate during L\u00ea Kh\u1ea3 Phi\u00eau's rule.<ref>{{cite web |author=Abuza, Zachary|title=The Lessons of Le Kha Phieu: Changing Rules in Vietnamese politics|date=16 November 2001|publisher=Vietnamese Professionals of America.

The country's highest judicial organ is the [[Supreme People's Court of Vietnam|Supreme People's Court]] (SPC) ({{lang-vi|T\u00f2a \u00e1n Nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n T\u1ed1i cao}}). The composition of the SCP includes the Chief Justice ({{lang-vi|Ch\u00e1nh \u00e1n T\u00f2a \u00e1n Nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n T\u1ed1i cao}}), Deputy Chief Judge, jurors and court secretaries. The structure of the SCP (from the top down) is as follows: Council of Judges, Commission of Judges, [[Military Courts of Vietnam|Central Military Court]], Criminal Court, Civil Court, Appeal Court, and assisting staff. The Chief Judge of the SCP is elected by the National Assembly, while the President of the Socialist Republic has the power to nominate and dismiss the Deputy Chief Judge and judges at the Chief Judge's request. The Central Committee of the [[Vietnamese Fatherland Front]] introduces People's Jurors, which are in turn appointed by the Standing Committee of the National Assembly. According to the Government Web Portal, the operating principles of the courts are, during hearings, that the \"judges and jurors are independent and only obey the laws.\" Justice and democracy within the system is supposedly ensured because legal decision-making is an open process. Jurors play an essential role, and defenders have the right of defence and to hire a lawyer.<ref name=\"Politicalsystem\"/>\n\nThe [[Supreme People's Procuracy of Vietnam|Supreme People's Prosecutor]] (SPP) ({{lang-vi|Vi\u1ec7n Ki\u1ec3m s\u00e1t Nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n T\u1ed1i cao}}), the Vietnamese equivalent to an [[attorney general]], observes the implementation process of the Ministries, ministerial-level agencies, government organs, local authorities, social and economic organisations, the armed forces, security forces and the Vietnamese citizens in general. The SPP respects the Constitution and state laws, practices public prosecution as stated by the law and ensures law enforcement. The head of the SPP is elected, dismissed, or removed from office by a proposal of the President. The Deputy Heads, prosecutors and inspectors appointed by the SPP head can be dismissed by the President on the Head's request.<ref name=\"Politicalsystem\"/>\n\nThe SPC is the highest court for appeal and review, and it reports to the National Assembly, which controls the judiciary's budget and confirms the president's nominees to the SPC and SPP. The SPP issues arrest warrants, sometimes retroactively. Below the SPC are district and provincial people's courts, military tribunals, and administrative, economic and labor courts. The people's courts are the courts of first instance. The [[Ministry of Defense (Vietnam)|Ministry of Defence]] (MOD) has military tribunals, which have the same rules as civil courts. Military judges and assessors are selected by the MOD and the SPC, but the SPC has supervisory responsibility. Although the constitution provides for independent judges and lay assessors (who lack administrative training), the [[United States Department of State]] maintains that Vietnam lacks an independent judiciary, in part because the Communist Party selects judges and vets them for political reliability. Moreover, the party seeks to influence the outcome of cases involving perceived threats to the state or the party's dominant position. In an effort to increase judicial independence, the government transferred local courts from the [[Ministry of Justice (Vietnam)|Ministry of Justice]] to the SPC in September 2002. However, the Department of State saw no evidence that the move actually achieved the stated goal. Vietnam's judiciary is also hampered by a shortage of lawyers and by rudimentary trial procedures. The death penalty often is imposed in cases of corruption and drug trafficking.<ref name=\"LOC\">{{cite web | url = http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Vietnam.pdf | title = Country Profile: Vietnam | date = December 2005 | accessdate=12 April 2012|publisher=[[Federal Research Division]] of the [[Library of Congress]]|page=16}}</ref>\n\n{{office-table}}\n\n|Head of the Steering Committee of the Central Judicial Reform\n|[[Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u1ea1i Quang]]\n|[[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]]\n|13 August 2016\n|-\n|Chief Justice of the [[Supreme People's Court of Vietnam|Supreme People's Court]]\n|[[Nguy\u1ec5n H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh]]\n|[[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]]\n|8 April 2016\n|-\n|Director of the [[Supreme People's Procuracy of Vietnam|Supreme People's Prosecutor]]\n|[[L\u00ea Minh Tr\u00ed]]\n|Communist Party\n|8 April 2016\n|}\n\n==Elections==\n{{main|Elections in Vietnam}}\nArticle 6 of the Constitution states that \"The people make use of state power through the agency of the National Assembly and the People's Councils, which represent the will and aspirations of the people, are elected by them and responsible to them\".<ref name=\"articlesix\"/> Deputies (members) of the National Assembly are directly elected on a democratic basis through secret ballots.

A three-person collective leadership consists of the VCP general secretary, the prime minister, and the president.}}</ref> [[Executive (government)|Executive power]] is exercised by the government and the President of Vietnam. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the [[National Assembly of Vietnam]] ({{lang-vi| Qu\u1ed1c h\u1ed9i Vi\u1ec7t Nam}}). The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive. The parliament adopted the current [[Constitution of Vietnam]], its fifth, on 28 November 2013.\n\nThe  President ({{lang|vi|Ch\u1ee7 t\u1ecbch n\u01b0\u1edbc}}) is elected by National Assembly for a five-year term and acts as the [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Vietnam People's Armed Forces]] and Chairman of the Council for Defence and Security. Moreover, the president has the right to decide on executive brands. The [[Government of Vietnam|government]] ({{lang|vi|Ch\u00ednh ph\u1ee7}}), the main executive state power of Vietnam, is headed by the Prime Minister, who has several Deputy Prime Ministers and several ministers in charge of particular activities. The executive branch is responsible for the implementation of political, economic, cultural, social, national defence, security and external activities of the state. The National Assembly is a [[unicameral]] legislative body. The National Assembly has 500 members, elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. The legislature is, according to the constitution, the highest organ of the state. Its powers includes the enactment and amendment of the constitution and laws; the adoption of the [[government budget]]; supervising the Government of Vietnam and other holders of public powers [[Responsible government|responsible]] to the National Assembly; and appointing members of the judiciary. The Vietnamese constitution and legislation provide for regular elections for the office of the President of the Socialist Republic, the National Assembly and the [[People's Council (Vietnam)|People's Councils]].\n\nVietnam has a judicial system governed by the Constitution of Vietnam and national legislation enacted by National Assembly. The [[Supreme People's Court of Vietnam|Supreme People's Court]] ({{lang|vi|T\u00f2a \u00e1n Nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n T\u1ed1i cao}}) is the highest court of appeal in Vietnam. There are other specialised courts in Vietnam, including the Central Military Court, the Criminal Court, the Civil Court and the Appeal Court. The [[Supreme People's Procuracy of Vietnam|Supreme People's Procuracy]] observes the implementation of state organs and makes sure that Vietnamese citizens follow the law.\n[[File:Political Structure in Vietnam.png|thumb|Political Structure in Vietnam]]\n\n==Legal framework==\n{{main|Constitution of Vietnam}}\nVietnam is a [[One-party state|one-party]] [[Socialist state|socialist republic]].<ref name=\"preambleoftheconstitution\">{{cite web | title = Preamble of the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam | publisher = [[Government of Vietnam|Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] | url = http://www.chinhphu.vn/portal/page/portal/English/TheSocialistRepublicOfVietnam/AboutVietnam/AboutVietnamDetail?categoryId=10000103&articleId=10001012 | accessdate =20 April 2012}}</ref> The current Vietnamese state traces its direct lineage back to the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] (North Vietnam) and the [[August Revolution|1945 August Revolution]] led by [[Ho Chi Minh|H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh]]. The current constitution was adopted on 28 November 2013 by the [[National Assembly of Vietnam]]. There have been four other constitutions in Vietnamese history: the 1946, 1959, 1980, and 1992 constitutions. The [[Communist Party of Vietnam]], the leading non-State organ, operates in accordance with the laws. Government powers in Vietnam are divided into legislative, executive and judiciary powers.

[[Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Chinh]]'s biography of \"Chairman H\u1ed3\" in 1973 emphasised his revolutionary policies. The thoughts of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh were systematised in 1989, under the leadership of [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Linh]].{{sfn|Quinn-Judge|2002|p=2}} H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh Thought, alongside Marxism\u2013Leninism, became the official ideology of the CPV and the state in 1991.{{sfn|Gillespie|2006|p=90}} The CPV's claim to legitimacy was retained following the [[collapse of communism]] in 1989 and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 by its commitment to the thoughts of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, according to Sophie Quinn-Judge.{{sfn|Quinn-Judge|2002|p=256}} According to Pierre Brocheux, the author of ''Ho Chi Minh: a Biography'', the current state ideology is H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh Thought, with Marxism\u2013Leninism playing a secondary role.{{sfn|Brocheux|2007|p=186}} While some claim that H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh Thought is used as a veil for the Party leadership since they, according to this version, have stopped believing in [[communism]], this is false when considering that H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh was an avid supporter of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. Others see H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh Thought as a political umbrella term whose main function is to smuggle in non-socialist ideas and policies without challenging socialist legality.{{sfn|Gillespie|2006|p=90}}\n\nSince its foundation, the key ideology has been Marxism\u2013Leninism, but since the introduction of a [[mixed economy]] in the late 1980s and 1990s, it has lost its monopolistic ideological and moral legitimacy.{{sfn|Gillespie|2006|p=91}} Marxism\u2013Leninism, which is a class-based ideology, lost its legitimacy because of the mixed economy. As became clear because of the [[\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi]] reforms, the Party could not base its rule on defending only the workers and the peasants, which was officially referred to as the \"working class-peasant alliance\".{{sfn|Gillespie|2006|p=92}} In the constitution introduced in 1992, the State represented the \"workers, peasants and intellectuals\".{{sfn|Gillespie|2006|p=91}} In recent years, the Party has stopped representing a specific class, but instead the \"interests of the entire people\", which includes entrepreneurs.{{sfn|Gillespie|2006|p=91}} The final class barrier was removed in 2002, when party members were allowed to engage in private activities. In the face of de-emphasising the role of Marxism\u2013Leninism, the Party has acquired a broader ideology, placing more emphasis on [[nationalism]], [[developmentalism]], and becoming the protector of tradition.{{sfn|Gillespie|2006|pp=91\u201392}}\n\n==Communist Party of Vietnam==\n{{main|Communist Party of Vietnam}}\n[[File:Flag of the Communist Party of Vietnam.svg|thumb|The flag of the Communist Party of Vietnam]]\nAccording to the official version, the Communist Party of Vietnam ({{lang-vi|\u0110\u1ea3ng C\u1ed9ng s\u1ea3n Vi\u1ec7t Nam}}) is leading the Vietnamese people \"in carrying out the country's renovation, modernisation and industrialisation.\"<ref name=\"Politicalsystem\"/> According to the Party's statute, amended at the [[9th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam|9th National Congress]] on 22 April 2001, the CPV was \"established and trained by President H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, has led the Vietnamese people to carry out successfully the August Revolution, establishing the Democratic Republic of Vi\u1ec7t Nam, now the Socialist Republic of Vi\u1ec7t Nam, to defeat foreign invaders, to abolish the colonial and feudalist regime, to liberate and reunify the country, and then carry out the cause of renovation and socialist construction and firmly defend national independence.\"<ref name=\"Politicalsystem\"/> It believes in [[socialist internationalism]] of the [[working class]], and supports the \"struggle for peace, national independence, democracy and social progress of the world's people.\"<ref name=\"Politicalsystem\"/> The CPV acts as the vanguard of the working people and the whole nation by representing their interests. Its aim is to create \"a strong, independent, prosperous and democratic country with an equitable and civilized society, to realise [[Socialism (marxism)|socialism]] and ultimately, communism.\" The Party's ideological foundation is Marxism\u2013Leninism and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh Thoughts. These ideologies guide the activities of the Party, while promoting \"the nation's traditions, and absorbing other nations' essential ideas.\"<ref name=\"Politicalsystem\"/>\n\nThe CPV is organised on the principles of [[democratic centralism]]. It practices \"criticism, self-criticism, and strict discipline\" and pursues \"[[collective leadership]] and individual responsibility, and promoting comradeship and solidarity in line with the Party's political programs and statutes.\"<ref name=\"Politicalsystem\"/> The CPV is subject to Vietnamese laws and the Constitution. It is the country's ruling party and promotes the \"[[L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n#Ideological beliefs|mastery of the people over the country]]\". The Party is under the supervision of the people. It is dependent on having the people contribute to the party, by strengthening, uniting, and leading the people in the [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary cause]]. The political system in Vietnam is led by the CPV, and it \"leads, respects and promotes the role of the State, the [[Vietnamese Fatherland Front]] (VFF) and other socio-political organisations.\"<ref name=\"Politicalsystem\"/>\n\n===Congress===\n{{Main|National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam}}\nThe National Congress is the party's highest organ.{{sfn|Van|Cooper|1983|p=56}} The direction of the Party and the Government is decided at the National Congress, held every fifth year. The Central Committee is elected by the National Congress.{{sfn|Ashwill|Thai|2005|p=47}} Delegates vote on policies and candidate posts within the central party leadership. Following ratification of the decisions taken at the National Congress, the National Congress dissolves itself. The Central Committee, which is elected by the National Congress every fifth year, implements the decisions of the National Congress in the five-year period. Since the Central Committee only meets twice a year, the Politburo implements the policies of the National Congress.{{sfn|Van|Cooper|1983|p=56}}\n\n===Central Committee===\n[[File:HoChiMinhCity01c.jpg|thumb| [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] billboard marking the 30th anniversary of the reunification of the country in 1975]]\n{{main|Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam}}\nThe Central Committee (CC) is the CPV's most powerful institution.{{sfn|East|Thomas|2003|p=574}} It delegates some of its powers to the [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of Vietnam|Secretariat]] and the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of Vietnam|Politburo]] when it is not in session.{{sfn|Rowley|2008|p=187}} When the [[Vietnam War]] ended in 1975, the Vietnamese leadership, led by [[L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n]], began to centralise power. This policy continued until the [[6th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam|6th National Congress]], when [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Linh]] took power. Linh pursued a policy of economic and political decentralisation.<ref>{{cite web |author=Abuza, Zachary|title=The Lessons of Le Kha Phieu: Changing Rules in Vietnamese politics|date=16 November 2001|publisher=Vietnamese Professionals of America. [[The Catholic University of America]]|page=9}}</ref> The party and state bureaucracy opposed Linh's reform initiatives; because of this, Linh tried to win the support of provincial leaders. This caused the powers of the provincial chapters of the CPV to increase in the 1990s. The CPV lost its power to appoint or dismiss provincial-level officials in the 1990s; this is proven by the fact that [[V\u00f5 V\u0103n Ki\u1ec7t]] tried to wrestle this power back to the centre during the 1990s without success. These developments led to the provincialisation of the Central Committee; for example, more and more CC members have a background in provincial party work. Because of these changes, power in Vietnam has become increasingly devolved.<ref>{{cite web |author=Abuza, Zachary|title=The Lessons of Le Kha Phieu: Changing Rules in Vietnamese politics|date=16 November 2001|publisher=Vietnamese Professionals of America. [[The Catholic University of America]] |page=10}}</ref> The number of Central Committee members with a provincial background increased from a low of 15.6 percent in 1982 to a high of 41 percent in 2000. The former [[President of Vietnam|President of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] [[Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng T\u1ea5n Sang]] (2001-2016) was directly elected from the provinces at the [[8th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam|8th Party Congress]], held in 1996.<ref>{{cite web |author=Abuza, Zachary|title=The Lessons of Le Kha Phieu: Changing Rules in Vietnamese politics|date=16 November 2001|publisher=Vietnamese Professionals of America. [[The Catholic University of America]]|page=11}}</ref> Because of the devolution of power, the powers of the Central Committee have increased substantially; for instance, when a two-thirds majority of the Politburo voted in favour of retaining [[L\u00ea Kh\u1ea3 Phi\u00eau]] as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam|General Secretary]] (the leader of Vietnam), the Central Committee voted against the Politburo's motion and voted unanimously in favour of removing L\u00ea Kh\u1ea3 Phi\u00eau from his post of General Secretary.<ref>{{cite web |author=Abuza, Zachary|title=The Lessons of Le Kha Phieu: Changing Rules in Vietnamese politics|date=16 November 2001|publisher=Vietnamese Professionals of America.

The country's highest judicial organ is the [[Supreme People's Court of Vietnam|Supreme People's Court]] (SPC) ({{lang-vi|T\u00f2a \u00e1n Nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n T\u1ed1i cao}}). The composition of the SCP includes the Chief Justice ({{lang-vi|Ch\u00e1nh \u00e1n T\u00f2a \u00e1n Nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n T\u1ed1i cao}}), Deputy Chief Judge, jurors and court secretaries. The structure of the SCP (from the top down) is as follows: Council of Judges, Commission of Judges, [[Military Courts of Vietnam|Central Military Court]], Criminal Court, Civil Court, Appeal Court, and assisting staff. The Chief Judge of the SCP is elected by the National Assembly, while the President of the Socialist Republic has the power to nominate and dismiss the Deputy Chief Judge and judges at the Chief Judge's request. The Central Committee of the [[Vietnamese Fatherland Front]] introduces People's Jurors, which are in turn appointed by the Standing Committee of the National Assembly. According to the Government Web Portal, the operating principles of the courts are, during hearings, that the \"judges and jurors are independent and only obey the laws.\" Justice and democracy within the system is supposedly ensured because legal decision-making is an open process. Jurors play an essential role, and defenders have the right of defence and to hire a lawyer.<ref name=\"Politicalsystem\"/>\n\nThe [[Supreme People's Procuracy of Vietnam|Supreme People's Prosecutor]] (SPP) ({{lang-vi|Vi\u1ec7n Ki\u1ec3m s\u00e1t Nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n T\u1ed1i cao}}), the Vietnamese equivalent to an [[attorney general]], observes the implementation process of the Ministries, ministerial-level agencies, government organs, local authorities, social and economic organisations, the armed forces, security forces and the Vietnamese citizens in general. The SPP respects the Constitution and state laws, practices public prosecution as stated by the law and ensures law enforcement. The head of the SPP is elected, dismissed, or removed from office by a proposal of the President. The Deputy Heads, prosecutors and inspectors appointed by the SPP head can be dismissed by the President on the Head's request.<ref name=\"Politicalsystem\"/>\n\nThe SPC is the highest court for appeal and review, and it reports to the National Assembly, which controls the judiciary's budget and confirms the president's nominees to the SPC and SPP. The SPP issues arrest warrants, sometimes retroactively. Below the SPC are district and provincial people's courts, military tribunals, and administrative, economic and labor courts. The people's courts are the courts of first instance. The [[Ministry of Defense (Vietnam)|Ministry of Defence]] (MOD) has military tribunals, which have the same rules as civil courts. Military judges and assessors are selected by the MOD and the SPC, but the SPC has supervisory responsibility. Although the constitution provides for independent judges and lay assessors (who lack administrative training), the [[United States Department of State]] maintains that Vietnam lacks an independent judiciary, in part because the Communist Party selects judges and vets them for political reliability. Moreover, the party seeks to influence the outcome of cases involving perceived threats to the state or the party's dominant position. In an effort to increase judicial independence, the government transferred local courts from the [[Ministry of Justice (Vietnam)|Ministry of Justice]] to the SPC in September 2002. However, the Department of State saw no evidence that the move actually achieved the stated goal. Vietnam's judiciary is also hampered by a shortage of lawyers and by rudimentary trial procedures. The death penalty often is imposed in cases of corruption and drug trafficking.<ref name=\"LOC\">{{cite web | url = http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Vietnam.pdf | title = Country Profile: Vietnam | date = December 2005 | accessdate=12 April 2012|publisher=[[Federal Research Division]] of the [[Library of Congress]]|page=16}}</ref>\n\n{{office-table}}\n\n|Head of the Steering Committee of the Central Judicial Reform\n|[[Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u1ea1i Quang]]\n|[[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]]\n|13 August 2016\n|-\n|Chief Justice of the [[Supreme People's Court of Vietnam|Supreme People's Court]]\n|[[Nguy\u1ec5n H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh]]\n|[[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]]\n|8 April 2016\n|-\n|Director of the [[Supreme People's Procuracy of Vietnam|Supreme People's Prosecutor]]\n|[[L\u00ea Minh Tr\u00ed]]\n|Communist Party\n|8 April 2016\n|}\n\n==Elections==\n{{main|Elections in Vietnam}}\nArticle 6 of the Constitution states that \"The people make use of state power through the agency of the National Assembly and the People's Councils, which represent the will and aspirations of the people, are elected by them and responsible to them\".<ref name=\"articlesix\"/> Deputies (members) of the National Assembly are directly elected on a democratic basis through secret ballots.

Some analysts believe that a generation is one of the fundamental social categories in a society, while others view its importance as being overshadowed by other factors including class, gender, race, and education, among others.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''generate'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''gener\u0101re'', meaning \"to beget\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/generate |title=Generate &#124; Define Generate at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date=15 June 1995 |accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref> The word ''generation'' as a ''[[Cohort (statistics)|Group or cohort]]'' in [[social science]] signifies the entire body of individuals born and living at about the same time, most of whom are approximately the same age and have similar ideas, problems, and attitudes (e.g., [[Beat Generation]] and [[Lost Generation]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/generation|title=Definition of generation &#124; Dictionary.com|website=www.dictionary.com}}</ref>\n\n==Familial generation==\n[[File:Lynch Armenia Five generations.png|thumb|right|Five generations of one Armenian family\u2014a child with her mother, grandmother, great-grandmother and great-great-grandmother.

Prior to that the concept \"generation\" had generally referred to family relationships and not broader social groupings. In 1863, French [[lexicographer]] [[Emile Littr\u00e9]] had defined a generation as, \"all people coexisting in society at any given time\".<ref name=Wohl203>{{Cite book| last=Wohl | first=Robert | title=The generation of 1914 | year=1979 | publisher=Harvard University Press | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts  | isbn=978-0-674-34466-2 | pages=203\u2013209 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=YLe3e3FDXQkC&lpg=PA1&dq=wohl%201914&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q=}}</ref>{{rp|19}}\n\nSeveral trends promoted a new idea of generations, as the 19th century wore on, of a society divided into different categories of people based on age. These trends were all related to the processes of [[modernisation]], [[industrialisation]], or [[westernisation]], which had been changing the face of Europe since the mid-18th century. One was a change in mentality about time and social change. The increasing prevalence of [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] ideas encouraged the idea that society and life were changeable, and that civilization could [[Social progress|progress]]. This encouraged the equation of youth with social renewal and change. Political rhetoric in the 19th century often focused on the renewing power of youth influenced by movements such as [[Young Italy]], [[Young Germany]], [[Sturm und Drang]], the [[German Youth Movement]], and other [[romantic movement]]s. By the end of the 19th century, European intellectuals were disposed toward thinking of the world in generational terms\u2014in terms of youth rebellion and emancipation.<ref name=Wohl203 />\n\nTwo important contributing factors to the change in mentality were the change in the economic structure of society. Because of the rapid social and economic change, young men particularly were less beholden to their fathers and family authority than they had been. Greater social and economic mobility allowed them to flout their authority to a much greater extent than had traditionally been possible. Additionally, the skills and wisdom of fathers were often less valuable than they had been due to technological and social change.<ref name=Wohl203 /> During this time, the period between [[childhood]] and [[adulthood]], usually spent at university or in military service, was also increased for many people entering [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] jobs. This category of people was very influential in spreading the ideas of youthful renewal.<ref name=Wohl203 />\n\nAnother important factor was the breakdown of traditional social and regional identifications. The spread of [[nationalism]] and many of the factors that created it (a national press, linguistic homogenisation, [[public education]], suppression of local particularities) encouraged a broader sense of belonging beyond local affiliations. People thought of themselves increasingly as part of a society, and this encouraged identification with groups beyond the local.<ref name=Wohl203 /> [[Auguste Comte]] was the first philosopher to make a serious attempt to systematically study generations. In ''Cours de philosophie positive'' Comte suggested that social change is determined by generational change and in particular conflict between successive generations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/classes/201/articles/85JaegerGenInHistHISTTHEO.pdf |title=Hans Jaeger.

Other important theorists of the 19th century were [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Wilhelm Dilthey]].\n\nSociologist [[Karl Mannheim]] was a seminal figure in the study of generations. He elaborated a [[theory of generations]] in his 1923 essay ''The Problem of Generations''.<ref name=\"Pilcher\" /> He suggested that there had been a division into two primary schools of study of generations until that time.  Firstly, positivists such as Comte measured social change in designated life spans.  Mannheim argued that this reduced history to \"a chronological table\". The other school, the \"romantic-historical\" was represented by Dilthey and [[Martin Heidegger]]. This school focused on the individual qualitative experience at the expense of social context. Mannheim emphasised that the rapidity of social change in youth was crucial to the formation of generations, and that not every generation would come to see itself as distinct. In periods of rapid social change a generation would be much more likely to develop a cohesive character. He also believed that a number of distinct sub-generations could exist.<ref name=\"Pilcher\" />\n\nAccording to Gilleard and Higgs, Mannheim identified three commonalities that a generation shares:<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Gilleard| first1=Chris| last2=Higgs| first2=Paul| title=The third age: Class, cohort or generation?|journal=Ageing and Society| year=2002| volume=22| issue=3| pages=369\u2013382| doi=10.1017/s0144686x0200870x}}</ref>\n* Shared temporal location \u2013 generational site or birth cohort\n* Shared historical location \u2013 generation as actuality or exposure to a common era\n* Shared sociocultural location \u2013 generational consciousness or \"[[entelechy]]\"\n\nAuthors [[William Strauss]] and [[Neil Howe]] developed the [[Strauss-Howe generational theory]] outlining what they saw as a pattern of generations repeating throughout American history. This theory became quite influential with the public and reignited an interest in the sociology of generations. This led to the creation of an industry of consulting, publishing, and marketing in the field.<ref name=\"COHE\">{{cite web|first=Eric |last=Hoover|url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Millennial-Muddle-How/48772/ |title=The Millennial Muddle|work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=11 October 2009 |accessdate=21 August 2019}}</ref> The theory has alternatively been criticized by social scientists and journalists who argue it is non-[[falsifiability|falsifiable]], [[determinism|deterministic]], and unsupported by rigorous evidence.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Brooks|first1=David|authorlink=David Brooks (cultural commentator)|title=What's the Matter With Kids Today?

The concept of a generation can be used to locate particular birth cohorts in specific historical and cultural circumstances, such as the \"[[Baby boomers]]\".<ref name=\"Biggs 2007 695\u2013711\"/>\n\nHistorian Hans Jaeger shows that, during this long history, two schools of thought coalesced regarding how generations form: the \"pulse-rate hypothesis\" and the \"imprint hypothesis.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jaeger |first1=Hans |title=Generations in History: Reflections on a Controversial Concept |journal=History and Theory |date=1985 |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=273\u2013292 |url=http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/classes/201/articles/85JaegerGenInHistHISTTHEOCrOCR.pdf|doi=10.2307/2505170 |jstor=2505170 }}</ref> According to the pulse-rate hypothesis, a society's entire population can be divided into a series of non-overlapping cohorts, each of which develops a unique \"peer personality\" because of the time period in which each cohort came of age.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Strauss |first1=William |last2=Howe |first2=Neil |title=Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584\u20132069 |date=1991 |publisher=Harper |location=New York}}</ref> The movement of these cohorts from one life-stage to the next creates a repeating cycle that shapes the history of that society. Currently, the most prominent example of pulse-rate generational theory is the [[Strauss-Howe generational theory]]; however, [[Jose Ortega y Gasset]] and [[Juli\u00e1n Mar\u00edas]] followed this approach before them.\n\nSocial scientists tend to reject the pulse-rate hypothesis because, as Jaeger explains, \"the concrete results of the theory of the universal pulse rate of history are, of course, very modest. With a few exceptions, the same goes for the partial pulse-rate theories. Since they generally gather data without any knowledge of statistical principles, the authors are often least likely to notice to what extent the jungle of names and numbers which they present lacks any convincing organization according to generations.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jaeger |first1=Hans |title=Generations in History: Reflections on a Controversial Concept |journal=History and Theory |date=1885 |volume=24 |issue=3 |page=283 |url=http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/classes/201/articles/85JaegerGenInHistHISTTHEOCrOCR.pdf}}</ref>\n\nSocial scientists follow the \"imprint hypothesis\" of generations, which can be traced to [[Karl Mannheim]]'s [[theory of generations]]. According to the imprint hypothesis, generations are only produced by specific historical events that cause young people to perceive the world differently than their elders. Thus, not everyone may be part of a generation; only those who share a unique social and biographical experience of an important historical moment will become part of a \"generation as an actuality.\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Mannheim |first= Karl | chapter= The Problem of Generations |date=1952 |title= Essays on the Sociology of Knowledge: Collected Works, Volume 5 |editor1-last = Kecskemeti | editor1-first= Paul | location= New York|publisher= Routledge|pages=276\u2013322}}</ref> When following the imprint hypothesis, social scientists face a number of challenges. They cannot accept the labels and chronological boundaries of generations that come from the pulse-rate hypothesis (like Generation X or Millennial); instead, the chronological boundaries of generations must be determined inductively and who is part of the generation must be determined through historical, quantitative, and qualitative analysis.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hart-Brinson |first1=Peter |title=The Gay Marriage Generation: How the LGBTQ Movement Transformed American Culture |date=2018 |publisher=NYU Press |location=New York}}</ref>\n\nWhile all generations have similarities, there are differences among them as well. A 2007 [[Pew Research Center]] report called \"Millennials: Confident. Connected. Open to Change\" noted the challenge of studying generations: \"Generational analysis has a long and distinguished place in social science, and we cast our lot with those scholars who believe it is not only possible, but often highly illuminating, to search for the unique and distinctive characteristics of any given age group of Americans. But we also know this is not an exact science. We are mindful that there are as many differences in attitudes, values, behaviors, and lifestyles within a generation as there are between generations. But we believe this reality does not diminish the value of generational analysis; it merely adds to its richness and complexity.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Millennials. Confident, Connected.

Prior to that the concept \"generation\" had generally referred to family relationships and not broader social groupings. In 1863, French [[lexicographer]] [[Emile Littr\u00e9]] had defined a generation as, \"all people coexisting in society at any given time\".<ref name=Wohl203>{{Cite book| last=Wohl | first=Robert | title=The generation of 1914 | year=1979 | publisher=Harvard University Press | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts  | isbn=978-0-674-34466-2 | pages=203\u2013209 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=YLe3e3FDXQkC&lpg=PA1&dq=wohl%201914&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q=}}</ref>{{rp|19}}\n\nSeveral trends promoted a new idea of generations, as the 19th century wore on, of a society divided into different categories of people based on age. These trends were all related to the processes of [[modernisation]], [[industrialisation]], or [[westernisation]], which had been changing the face of Europe since the mid-18th century. One was a change in mentality about time and social change. The increasing prevalence of [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] ideas encouraged the idea that society and life were changeable, and that civilization could [[Social progress|progress]]. This encouraged the equation of youth with social renewal and change. Political rhetoric in the 19th century often focused on the renewing power of youth influenced by movements such as [[Young Italy]], [[Young Germany]], [[Sturm und Drang]], the [[German Youth Movement]], and other [[romantic movement]]s. By the end of the 19th century, European intellectuals were disposed toward thinking of the world in generational terms\u2014in terms of youth rebellion and emancipation.<ref name=Wohl203 />\n\nTwo important contributing factors to the change in mentality were the change in the economic structure of society. Because of the rapid social and economic change, young men particularly were less beholden to their fathers and family authority than they had been. Greater social and economic mobility allowed them to flout their authority to a much greater extent than had traditionally been possible. Additionally, the skills and wisdom of fathers were often less valuable than they had been due to technological and social change.<ref name=Wohl203 /> During this time, the period between [[childhood]] and [[adulthood]], usually spent at university or in military service, was also increased for many people entering [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] jobs. This category of people was very influential in spreading the ideas of youthful renewal.<ref name=Wohl203 />\n\nAnother important factor was the breakdown of traditional social and regional identifications. The spread of [[nationalism]] and many of the factors that created it (a national press, linguistic homogenisation, [[public education]], suppression of local particularities) encouraged a broader sense of belonging beyond local affiliations. People thought of themselves increasingly as part of a society, and this encouraged identification with groups beyond the local.<ref name=Wohl203 /> [[Auguste Comte]] was the first philosopher to make a serious attempt to systematically study generations. In ''Cours de philosophie positive'' Comte suggested that social change is determined by generational change and in particular conflict between successive generations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/classes/201/articles/85JaegerGenInHistHISTTHEO.pdf |title=Hans Jaeger.

Other important theorists of the 19th century were [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Wilhelm Dilthey]].\n\nSociologist [[Karl Mannheim]] was a seminal figure in the study of generations. He elaborated a [[theory of generations]] in his 1923 essay ''The Problem of Generations''.<ref name=\"Pilcher\" /> He suggested that there had been a division into two primary schools of study of generations until that time.  Firstly, positivists such as Comte measured social change in designated life spans.  Mannheim argued that this reduced history to \"a chronological table\". The other school, the \"romantic-historical\" was represented by Dilthey and [[Martin Heidegger]]. This school focused on the individual qualitative experience at the expense of social context. Mannheim emphasised that the rapidity of social change in youth was crucial to the formation of generations, and that not every generation would come to see itself as distinct. In periods of rapid social change a generation would be much more likely to develop a cohesive character. He also believed that a number of distinct sub-generations could exist.<ref name=\"Pilcher\" />\n\nAccording to Gilleard and Higgs, Mannheim identified three commonalities that a generation shares:<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Gilleard| first1=Chris| last2=Higgs| first2=Paul| title=The third age: Class, cohort or generation?|journal=Ageing and Society| year=2002| volume=22| issue=3| pages=369\u2013382| doi=10.1017/s0144686x0200870x}}</ref>\n* Shared temporal location \u2013 generational site or birth cohort\n* Shared historical location \u2013 generation as actuality or exposure to a common era\n* Shared sociocultural location \u2013 generational consciousness or \"[[entelechy]]\"\n\nAuthors [[William Strauss]] and [[Neil Howe]] developed the [[Strauss-Howe generational theory]] outlining what they saw as a pattern of generations repeating throughout American history. This theory became quite influential with the public and reignited an interest in the sociology of generations. This led to the creation of an industry of consulting, publishing, and marketing in the field.<ref name=\"COHE\">{{cite web|first=Eric |last=Hoover|url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Millennial-Muddle-How/48772/ |title=The Millennial Muddle|work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=11 October 2009 |accessdate=21 August 2019}}</ref> The theory has alternatively been criticized by social scientists and journalists who argue it is non-[[falsifiability|falsifiable]], [[determinism|deterministic]], and unsupported by rigorous evidence.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Brooks|first1=David|authorlink=David Brooks (cultural commentator)|title=What's the Matter With Kids Today?

The concept of a generation can be used to locate particular birth cohorts in specific historical and cultural circumstances, such as the \"[[Baby boomers]]\".<ref name=\"Biggs 2007 695\u2013711\"/>\n\nHistorian Hans Jaeger shows that, during this long history, two schools of thought coalesced regarding how generations form: the \"pulse-rate hypothesis\" and the \"imprint hypothesis.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jaeger |first1=Hans |title=Generations in History: Reflections on a Controversial Concept |journal=History and Theory |date=1985 |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=273\u2013292 |url=http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/classes/201/articles/85JaegerGenInHistHISTTHEOCrOCR.pdf|doi=10.2307/2505170 |jstor=2505170 }}</ref> According to the pulse-rate hypothesis, a society's entire population can be divided into a series of non-overlapping cohorts, each of which develops a unique \"peer personality\" because of the time period in which each cohort came of age.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Strauss |first1=William |last2=Howe |first2=Neil |title=Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584\u20132069 |date=1991 |publisher=Harper |location=New York}}</ref> The movement of these cohorts from one life-stage to the next creates a repeating cycle that shapes the history of that society. Currently, the most prominent example of pulse-rate generational theory is the [[Strauss-Howe generational theory]]; however, [[Jose Ortega y Gasset]] and [[Juli\u00e1n Mar\u00edas]] followed this approach before them.\n\nSocial scientists tend to reject the pulse-rate hypothesis because, as Jaeger explains, \"the concrete results of the theory of the universal pulse rate of history are, of course, very modest. With a few exceptions, the same goes for the partial pulse-rate theories. Since they generally gather data without any knowledge of statistical principles, the authors are often least likely to notice to what extent the jungle of names and numbers which they present lacks any convincing organization according to generations.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jaeger |first1=Hans |title=Generations in History: Reflections on a Controversial Concept |journal=History and Theory |date=1885 |volume=24 |issue=3 |page=283 |url=http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/classes/201/articles/85JaegerGenInHistHISTTHEOCrOCR.pdf}}</ref>\n\nSocial scientists follow the \"imprint hypothesis\" of generations, which can be traced to [[Karl Mannheim]]'s [[theory of generations]]. According to the imprint hypothesis, generations are only produced by specific historical events that cause young people to perceive the world differently than their elders. Thus, not everyone may be part of a generation; only those who share a unique social and biographical experience of an important historical moment will become part of a \"generation as an actuality.\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Mannheim |first= Karl | chapter= The Problem of Generations |date=1952 |title= Essays on the Sociology of Knowledge: Collected Works, Volume 5 |editor1-last = Kecskemeti | editor1-first= Paul | location= New York|publisher= Routledge|pages=276\u2013322}}</ref> When following the imprint hypothesis, social scientists face a number of challenges. They cannot accept the labels and chronological boundaries of generations that come from the pulse-rate hypothesis (like Generation X or Millennial); instead, the chronological boundaries of generations must be determined inductively and who is part of the generation must be determined through historical, quantitative, and qualitative analysis.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hart-Brinson |first1=Peter |title=The Gay Marriage Generation: How the LGBTQ Movement Transformed American Culture |date=2018 |publisher=NYU Press |location=New York}}</ref>\n\nWhile all generations have similarities, there are differences among them as well. A 2007 [[Pew Research Center]] report called \"Millennials: Confident. Connected. Open to Change\" noted the challenge of studying generations: \"Generational analysis has a long and distinguished place in social science, and we cast our lot with those scholars who believe it is not only possible, but often highly illuminating, to search for the unique and distinctive characteristics of any given age group of Americans. But we also know this is not an exact science. We are mindful that there are as many differences in attitudes, values, behaviors, and lifestyles within a generation as there are between generations. But we believe this reality does not diminish the value of generational analysis; it merely adds to its richness and complexity.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Millennials. Confident, Connected.

He argued that generations may sometimes be a \"threat to stability\" but at the same time they represent \"the opportunity for social transformation\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ryder|first=Norman|title=The cohort as a concept in the study of social change|journal=[[American Sociological Review]]|year=1965|volume=30|issue=6|pages=843\u2013861|doi=10.2307/2090964|jstor=2090964}}</ref> Ryder attempted to understand the dynamics at play between generations.\n\nAmanda Grenier, in a 2007 essay published in ''[[Journal of Social Issues]]'', offered another source of explanation for why generational tensions exist. Grenier asserted that generations develop their own linguistic models that contribute to misunderstanding between age cohorts, \"Different ways of speaking exercised by older and younger people exist, and may be partially explained by social historical reference points, culturally determined experiences, and individual interpretations\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Grenier|first=Amanda|title=Crossing age and generational boundaries: Exploring intergenerational research encounters|journal=[[Journal of Social Issues]]|year=2007|volume=63|issue=4|page=718|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.2007.00532.x}}</ref>\n\n[[Karl Mannheim]], in his 1952 book ''[[Essays on the Sociology of Knowledge]]'' asserted the belief that people are shaped through lived experiences as a result of social change. Howe and Strauss also have written on the similarities of people within a generation being attributed to social change. Based on the way these lived experiences shape a generation in regard to values, the result is that the new generation will challenge the older generation's values, resulting in tension. This challenge between generations and the tension that arises is a defining point for understanding generations and what separates them.<ref>Mannheim, Karl.

The changes may have been done in the [[underdrawing]] of the painting, or by the visible layers of paint differing from the underdrawing, or by the first painted treatment of the element having been over-painted.\n\nSome pentimenti have always been visible on the final painting with careful inspection; others are revealed by the increasing transparency that some paint acquires after several centuries. Others, especially in the underdrawing, can only be seen with modern methods such as [[X-ray]]s and [[Infrared reflectography#Art history|infrared reflectography]] and photographs.  These are able to record photographically some [[pigment]]s, depending on their chemical composition, which remain covered by later paint layers. For example, [[white lead]], a common pigment, will be detected by X-ray, and [[carbon black]] underdrawings can often be seen with great clarity in infra-red reflectograms.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221432/http://www.clevelandart.org/exhibcef/ConsExhib/html/72881.html] These methods have greatly expanded the number of pentimenti art historians are aware of, and confirmed that they are very common in the works of many [[old master]]s, from [[Jan van Eyck]] onwards.\n[[File:OldGuitaristLady.jpg|thumb|left|230px|The face of the woman in the image ''[[The Old Guitarist]] ''is painted over.

Normally, secondary versions or copies will have few if any pentimenti, although this will not always be the case, as in ''[[The Lute Player (Caravaggio)|The Lute Player]]'' by [[Caravaggio]].  Like [[Rembrandt]], [[Titian]] and many other masters, Caravaggio seems rarely to have made preliminary drawings but to have composed straight onto the canvas.

In cases where a composition has been changed by a later painter or restorer, marks showing the original composition would not be described as pentimenti either, it must be the original painter who has changed his mind.\n\nEvidence of pentimenti may also help experts determine that the work was not created by a copier or forger since they are more likely to reproduce the original without making changes.<ref>https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/france-rediscovered-caravaggio-auction-intl-scli/index.html</ref>\n\n==Usage in English==\nThe term is usually treated as an Italian word and therefore written in italics, depending on the style used in the individual context.

The distinction between singular and plural is also rather flexible; some writers refer to a change of just one outline as ''pentimenti'', whilst others treat each area that has been changed as a single ''pentimento''.

It can now be found also in the Royal Marines, Army Air Corps, Royal Canadian Navy, [[Royal New Zealand Navy]], [[Royal Australian Navy]], [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF), [[Royal Dutch Navy]], and the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). It is believed to originate in the 18th/19th centuries from the Indian game [[Pachisi]], although the first reference to it in print does not appear until 1946.<ref>Irving, John James Cawdell, ''Royal Navalese:A Glossary of Forecastle and Quarterdeck Words and Phrases'' 1946</ref> It is mentioned in a diary by EJF Records (served 1928-1950) in 1937 as '''Huckers'''.<ref name=\"syh\">{{Cite web |title=Personal Time - Uckers |url=http://www.seayourhistory.org.uk/content/view/151/268/1/1/ |accessdate=2011-09-17}}</ref> \nUckers is generally played using the rules stated below, but these will vary from one branch of the Royal Navy to another, most famously with the WAFU Rules of the Fleet Air Arm. Where those branches of the RN have worked with the other Armed Forces usually has dictated what rules the new playing Service use; why fellow aviators tend to play under WAFU Rules for example.<ref name=\"syh\" />\n\nIt is also played in units of the [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)]] where it was introduced by aircraft technicians on loan from the Fleet Air Arm in the late 1950s/early 1960s. Uckers boards can now also be found in most RAF [[Squadron (aviation)|Squadron]] crewroom, where the game has caught on, especially with the Aircraft Technicians. Most RAAF crew rooms feature uckers boards also. In addition to the units services, units mentioned, uckers was also played by units in the Royal Artillery, particularly meteorologists and LifeFlight Toowoomba Rescue Helicopter crews aka Rescue 588.  The current and now 7-time world champion is Queenslander Mark Arthur. In the UK the Pusser's Rum World 'Uckers championships have been played for the last 5 years at various ROYAL NAVAL MUSEUMS, the most being notable being 2017 when the final was played on Nelson's Flagship HMS VICTORY and was won by the 'timber shifters' Wally Blagden and David Clark both ex RN. The next Pusser's Rum WORLD 'uckers' championships are being played in the Explosion Museum Gosport 26 October 2019. Wally and David are also current HMS GANGES Champions won in April 2019 Update Wally Blagden and Dave Clark the 'Timbershifters' have won the 2019 Championships.\n\n\nIt is similar to the board game [[Ludo (board game)|Ludo]] and is based on the same principles; getting four player pieces around the board before the opposition. The whole point of Uckers is to get all player pieces home before the opponent does. However, greater glory is attached to achieving all pieces home without the opponent getting any home at all\u2014this is known as an ''8 piecer''. The ultimate win is when the player gets all their pieces home and the opponent has all their pieces still in the base\u2014this is called an ''8 piece in harbour'',{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} or an ''eight-piece dicking''<ref>{{Cite book |author=Rick Jolly |title=Jackspeak: A Guide to British Naval Slang & Usage |publisher=FoSAMMA |year=2000 |isbn=0-9514305-2-1}}</ref> and merits the unfortunate player's name to be recorded on the reverse of the board.\n\n==Rules==\n[[File:Australian Six-Sided Uckers Board.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.1|Six-sided Uckers board]]\n\nAlthough Uckers is often played on a Ludo board a true Uckers board is a mirror image so the red and green squares are presented to the player facing them in the correct Naval manner, i.e. red to port and green to starboard.<ref name=\"uckers.co.uk\">http://www.uckers.co.uk</ref>\n\nThe game is played by either two or four people, if there are two people playing then each player takes two opposite colours, yellow and red vs green and blue. If there are four players then the players opposite each other become partners, so Yellow partners with Red, and Green partners with Blue.\n\nTo travel around the board two [[dice]] are thrown, players moving the amount shown on the dice, a six permitting an extra turn. To see who goes first each player throws the dice and whoever throws the highest starts.\n\nSome rules have evolved for the throwing of dice including no rolling of the dice from an open palm (Waterfall Technique), only tossing using the fingers. However, these are not used universally. If the dice leave the board, the IPS (International Playing Surface), accompanied by the call of \"off the IPS\" three times within the game this can be punished by losing the go up to all pieces home depending on which rules are being played. Unless the opponents deem it to have been done on purpose (for example to avoided moving a blob or mixing) then they may permit a re-roll.\n\nNo Dice rigging (no setting both sides to sixes and picking them up. dice must be picked up as they landed during the previous throw).\n\nIn order to exit the player's base it is necessary for a six to be thrown, which results in putting a piece on the coloured square joining the base known as the ''doorstep''.   However, if on the very first throw ''snake eyes'' (two ones) is thrown then all player (possibly partner's depending on which rules) pieces come out of the base onto the doorsteps - known as ''out all bits''. Play then continues with the next player.  If on rolling snake eyes on the first throw a player again throws snake eyes on their second throw all of their pieces return to the base. Under WAFU Rules, a player must call \"snake eyes\" prior to his first roll to benefit from rolling two \"ones\". He cannot do this retrospectively. If playing with a partner, then only his pieces come out not his partners.\n\nA throw can be split up into the two separate numbers so it is possible to move two different pieces as in [[backgammon]].  However, unlike [[backgammon]] if a player is moving only a single piece, then they must move it the sum of the two dice rather than moving the value of the first die and then moving the value of the second die.\n\nIf a player's piece lands on a square with an opponent's piece, then, as in Ludo, that piece is sent back to the opponent's base.\n\nIf a piece lands on a square with a playing piece of the same colour then this is known as a ''blob'' <ref name=\"uckers.co.uk\"/><ref name=\"submarine-museum.co.uk\">https://www.submarine-museum.co.uk/what-we-have/our-favourite-objects/uckers-cup/133</ref> and is basically a barrier. An opposing piece is not allowed to jump over them, but friendly pieces can.  The two ways an opposing piece can get by a blob is to destroy it, or by using an adjacent friendly blob to jump over it. A player can destroy the barrier by landing on an opponent's blob with a blob of their own or to ''six'' the blob off. To do this they will need to have a playing piece adjacent to the blob and then on their turn throw X + 1 six where X = the number of playing pieces forming the blob. Note that if the blob is on its own colour doorstep, then an additional six (i.e. X + 2 sixes) must be thrown to remove the blob and exit the homebase.\n\nIf one succeeds in knocking the blob off, then the single playing piece used to attack the blob is moved to the square that the blob was on and the pieces forming the blob are returned to the base. Play then continues to the next player.\n\nIf a player's piece lands on a square with a playing piece that belongs to their partner or is their other colour, then this is called a ''mixi blob'' (or a ''mixed barrier''). Unlike blobs, a mixi blob is equivalent to a single playing piece so the opponent can land on the square and send all the playing bits back to their relevant bases. The opponent can pass over a friendly mixi blob as it provides no barrier to movement; a blob may not be attacked by a piece from an adjacent opposing mixi blob.\n\nAs in Ludo, one does need to roll the exact number of spaces left to get home, and if a player's pieces are in the tube (or ''pipe'', though the Navy uses blunter terminology) then they cannot be attacked unless they are playing '''WAFU rules''' by invoking the \"suckback\" or \"blowback\" procedure.<ref name=\"submarine-museum.co.uk\"/> If playing with a partner and all their pieces get home first, then they can continue rolling in the hopes of getting a six.  If they do roll a six, then, on their next turn, they can then roll for and move their partner's pieces as well.  However, remaining pieces cannot be moved by the partner once they are in the tube. WAFU rules also require an exact out, not just a number in excess of that required to take the piece home.\n\nA player can either move normally or attack (or ''six'') a blob. A piece cannot be moved next to a blob and then, on the same go, attack it.\n\nIf only one die value is able to be played, the higher value must always take preference.\n\nIf a player(team) has all his pieces sent home as following the loss of an 8 piece mixi blob he has been subject to an \"8-piece dicking\".<ref name=\"uckers.co.uk\"/>\n\n== Advanced rules ==\n'''\"WAFU rules\"'''\n\nThe inclusion of certain extra rules is known in the Royal Navy as \"''WAFU rules''\" as they are most commonly played within [[Fleet Air Arm]].  \n\nIf a player gets one or more pieces into the pipe, an opposing player that lands on the end of that pipe can, on their next go, declare ''suckback''. The player then rolls the dice and if one of the numbers on the dice, or the sum of both, is the same as the number of spaces the other piece is up the pipe, it is returned to its base. If the number is missed then he moves one square preventing multiple attempts at a suckback. \n\nIn addition a ''blowback'' is the reverse of this, with the player of the piece in the pipe/tube risks it remaining vulnerable to a suckback by attempting to role the exact number of spaces between his piece and that of his opponent. If thrown, the opponent's piece is removed to the start. Recently, these rules have spread into the [[RAF]] and [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|AAC]] as the three services now train together.\n\nMixi blobs can also be formed, where the blob consists of more than one colour. This is often done when two players have paired up as the blob can no longer be moved. To move the blob the top piece must be moved, and so on until the blob becomes all one colour.\n\n'''Other rules'''\n\nAlthough not strictly required by the rules, there are several other traditions. A player purely throwing and moving his pieces to end the game without entering into the spirit of the game can be politely censured for being a \"Ludo player\" or heckled and embarrassed by the surrounding throng that can gather around heated games.\n\nCheating is not cheating unless caught. Whereupon a charge of \"timber shifting\" (the pieces usually having been made from a cut up broom handle) can be issued, returning a piece to its rightful place. Any timber shifting call should only come from those playing, hints from the crowd should be restricted to overly complex discussions of tactics or superfluous detail that serves only to distract.\n\nIf an 8-piece dicking is threatened, a player may resort to \"upboarding\" (depositing all pieces onto the floor) but he will be punished for such an action, inline with an 8-piecing, by having his name added to the reverse side of the board.\n\nA \"stand up\" finish is for the more debonair player who wishes to finish in style.  When requiring a number to finish that is possible from one dice throw, the player can state \"stand up finish\", throw his dice, stand up and walk away from the game without looking at the resulting throw in the hope that the correct number has appeared and he has won. Failing to do so, results in a slinking back to the board to continue, accompanied by polite banter from those present.\n\nIn the event of an extended dispute over any specialised local rules one of the players can request to see the rules, legend has it that the rules are printed on the underside of the board. The game is over as soon as the board is flipped to check the rules.\n\nIn some rulesets, throwing a double on the dice allows the player to move a blob backwards, and if he reaches the square immediately before the bottom of the chute by this method, he can then enter the chute with these pieces instead of having to travel around the board.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ludo (board game)|Ludo]]\u2014uses a similar gameboard\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.uckers-ya-uckers.co.uk Personalised Uckers Board Game Website]\n*[http://www.uckers.co.uk Uckers Website]\n*[http://www.hmsleander.co.uk/Uckers.htm HMS Leander]\n*[http://www.arrse.co.uk/wiki/Uckers Arrsepedia Uckers Page]\n*[http://www.uckersgame.co.uk Uckers Board Game Website]\n*{{bgg|19967|Uckers}}\n\n[[Category:Traditional board games]]\n[[Category:Cross and circle games]]\n[[Category:Royal Navy traditions]]\n[[Category:Articles needing cleanup]]\n", "text_old": "{{Cleanup|date=March 2020|reason=spelling, grammar, general cleanup}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Uckers gameboard graphic.png|right|thumb|upright=1.25|'''Uckers''' gameboard]]\n \n'''Uckers''' is a two- or four-player board game traditionally played in the Royal Navy and has spread to many of the other arms of the UK Armed Forces as well as to, mainly Commonwealth Forces.

However, if on the very first throw ''snake eyes'' (two ones) is thrown then all player (possibly partner's depending on which rules) pieces come out of the base onto the doorsteps - known as ''out all bits''. Play then continues with the next player.  If on rolling snake eyes on the first throw a player again throws snake eyes on their second throw all of their pieces return to the base. Under WAFU Rules, a player must call \"snake eyes\" prior to his first roll to benefit from rolling two \"ones\". He cannot do this retrospectively. If playing with a partner, then only his pieces come out not his partners.\n\nA throw can be split up into the two separate numbers so it is possible to move two different pieces as in [[backgammon]].  However, unlike [[backgammon]] if a player is moving only a single piece, then they must move it the sum of the two dice rather than moving the value of the first die and then moving the value of the second die.\n\nIf a player's piece lands on a square with an opponent's piece, then, as in Ludo, that piece is sent back to the opponent's base.\n\nIf a piece lands on a square with a playing piece of the same colour then this is known as a ''blob'' <ref name=\"uckers.co.uk\"/><ref name=\"submarine-museum.co.uk\">https://www.submarine-museum.co.uk/what-we-have/our-favourite-objects/uckers-cup/133</ref> and is basically a barrier. An opposing piece is not allowed to jump over them, but friendly pieces can.  The two ways an opposing piece can get by a blob is to destroy it, or by using an adjacent friendly blob to jump over it. A player can destroy the barrier by landing on an opponent's blob with a blob of their own or to ''six'' the blob off. To do this they will need to have a playing piece adjacent to the blob and then on their turn throw X + 1 six where X = the number of playing pieces forming the blob. Note that if the blob is on its own colour doorstep, then an additional six (i.e. X + 2 sixes) must be thrown to remove the blob and exit the homebase.\n\nIf one succeeds in knocking the blob off, then the single playing piece used to attack the blob is moved to the square that the blob was on and the pieces forming the blob are returned to the base. Play then continues to the next player.\n\nIf a player's piece lands on a square with a playing piece that belongs to their partner or is their other colour, then this is called a ''mixi blob'' (or a ''mixed barrier''). Unlike blobs, a mixi blob is equivalent to a single playing piece so the opponent can land on the square and send all the playing bits back to their relevant bases. The opponent can pass over a friendly mixi blob as it provides no barrier to movement; a blob may not be attacked by a piece from an adjacent opposing mixi blob.\n\nAs in Ludo, one does need to roll the exact number of spaces left to get home, and if a player's pieces are in the tube (or ''pipe'', though the Navy uses blunter terminology) then they cannot be attacked unless they are playing '''WAFU rules''' by invoking the \"suckback\" or \"blowback\" procedure.<ref name=\"submarine-museum.co.uk\"/> If playing with a partner and all their pieces get home first, then they can continue rolling in the hopes of getting a six.  If they do roll a six, then, on their next turn, they can then roll for and move their partner's pieces as well.  However, remaining pieces cannot be moved by the partner once they are in the tube. WAFU rules also require an exact out, not just a number in excess of that required to take the piece home.\n\nA player can either move normally or attack (or ''six'') a blob. A piece cannot be moved next to a blob and then, on the same go, attack it.\n\nIf only one die value is able to be played, the higher value must always take preference.\n\nIf a player(team) has all his pieces sent home as following the loss of an 8 piece mixi blob he has been subject to an \"8-piece dicking\".<ref name=\"uckers.co.uk\"/>\n\n== Advanced rules ==\n'''\"WAFU rules\"'''\n\nThe inclusion of certain extra rules is known in the Royal Navy as \"''WAFU rules''\" as they are most commonly played within [[Fleet Air Arm]].  \n\nIf a player gets one or more pieces into the pipe, an opposing player that lands on the end of that pipe can, on their next go, declare ''suckback''. The player then rolls the dice and if one of the numbers on the dice, or the sum of both, is the same as the number of spaces the other piece is up the pipe, it is returned to its base. If the number is missed then he moves one square preventing multiple attempts at a suckback. \n\nIn addition a ''blowback'' is the reverse of this, with the player of the piece in the pipe/tube risks it remaining vulnerable to a suckback by attempting to role the exact number of spaces between his piece and that of his opponent. If thrown, the opponent's piece is removed to the start. Recently, these rules have spread into the [[RAF]] and [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|AAC]] as the three services now train together.\n\nMixi blobs can also be formed, where the blob consists of more than one colour. This is often done when two players have paired up as the blob can no longer be moved. To move the blob the top piece must be moved, and so on until the blob becomes all one colour.\n\n'''Other rules'''\n\nAlthough not strictly required by the rules, there are several other traditions. A player purely throwing and moving his pieces to end the game without entering into the spirit of the game can be politely censured for being a \"Ludo player\" or heckled and embarrassed by the surrounding throng that can gather around heated games.\n\nCheating is not cheating unless caught. Whereupon a charge of \"timber shifting\" (the pieces usually having been made from a cut up broom handle) can be issued, returning a piece to its rightful place. Any timber shifting call should only come from those playing, hints from the crowd should be restricted to overly complex discussions of tactics or superfluous detail that serves only to distract.\n\nIf an 8-piece dicking is threatened, a player may resort to \"upboarding\" (depositing all pieces onto the floor) but he will be punished for such an action, inline with an 8-piecing, by having his name added to the reverse side of the board.\n\nA \"stand up\" finish is for the more debonair player who wishes to finish in style.  When requiring a number to finish that is possible from one dice throw, the player can state \"stand up finish\", throw his dice, stand up and walk away from the game without looking at the resulting throw in the hope that the correct number has appeared and he has won. Failing to do so, results in a slinking back to the board to continue, accompanied by polite banter from those present.\n\nIn the event of an extended dispute over any specialised local rules one of the players can request to see the rules, legend has it that the rules are printed on the underside of the board. The game is over as soon as the board is flipped to check the rules.\n\nIn some rulesets, throwing a double on the dice allows the player to move a blob backwards, and if he reaches the square immediately before the bottom of the chute by this method, he can then enter the chute with these pieces instead of having to travel around the board.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ludo (board game)|Ludo]]\u2014uses a similar gameboard\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.uckers-ya-uckers.co.uk Personalised Uckers Board Game Website]\n*[http://www.uckers.co.uk Uckers Website]\n*[http://www.hmsleander.co.uk/Uckers.htm HMS Leander]\n*[http://www.arrse.co.uk/wiki/Uckers Arrsepedia Uckers Page]\n*[http://www.uckersgame.co.uk Uckers Board Game Website]\n*{{bgg|19967|Uckers}}\n\n[[Category:Traditional board games]]\n[[Category:Cross and circle games]]\n[[Category:Royal Navy traditions]]\n[[Category:Articles needing cleanup]]\n", "name_user": "Grylliade", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removed remaining vandalism; inserted spaces where necessary", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uckers"}
