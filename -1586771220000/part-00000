These signals are refined and controlled by the interactions with other types of neurons in the retina.\n\nThe five basic classes of neurons within the retina are [[photoreceptor cell]]s, [[bipolar cells]], [[Retinal ganglion cell|ganglion cells]], [[horizontal cells]], and [[amacrine cells]].\n\nThe basic circuitry of the retina incorporates a three-neuron chain consisting of the photoreceptor (either a [[Rod cell|rod]] or [[Cone cell|cone]]), bipolar cell, and the ganglion cell.\n\nThe first action potential occurs in the retinal ganglion cell. This pathway is the most direct way for transmitting visual information to the brain.\n\nThere are three primary types of photoreceptors: [[Cone cell|Cones]] are photoreceptors that respond significantly to [[color]].  In humans the three different types of cones correspond with a primary response to short wavelength (blue), medium wavelength (green), and long wavelength (yellow/red).<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 2010\">\"eye, human.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

Chicago: Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 2010.</ref> [[Rod cell|Rods]] are photoreceptors that are very sensitive to the intensity of light, allowing for vision in dim lighting.  The concentrations and ratio of rods to cones is strongly correlated with whether an animal is [[Diurnality|diurnal]] or [[nocturnal]].  In humans, rods outnumber cones by approximately 20:1, while in nocturnal animals, such as the [[tawny owl]], the ratio is closer to 1000:1.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 2010\" /> [[Retinal ganglion cell]]s are involved in the [[sympathetic response]].

Depending on the movement, the hair cell can either hyperpolarize or depolarize. When the movement is towards the tallest [[stereocilia]], the Na<sup>+</sup> cation channels open allowing Na<sup>+</sup> to flow into cell and the resulting depolarization causes the Ca<sup>++</sup> channels to open, thus releasing its neurotransmitter into the afferent auditory nerve. There are two types of hair cells: inner and outer. The inner hair cells are the sensory receptors <!-- the sentence about outer hair cells being from efferent neurons is incorrect -->.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Neuroscience|last=Purves|first=Dale|last2=Augustine|first2=George|last3=Fitzpatrick|first3=David|last4=Hall|first4=William|last5=LaMantia|first5=Anthony-Samuel|last6=McNamara|first6=James|last7=White|first7=Leonard|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=978-0878936977|edition=4|location=|pages=327\u2013330|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nProblems with sensory neurons associated with the auditory system leads to disorders such as:\n* [[Auditory processing disorder]] \u2013 Auditory information in the brain is processed in an abnormal way.

It is a simple device which uses a mirror in a box to create an illusion in which the sensory system perceives that it is seeing two hands instead of one, therefore allowing the sensory system to control the \"phantom limb\".

These signals are refined and controlled by the interactions with other types of neurons in the retina.\n\nThe five basic classes of neurons within the retina are [[photoreceptor cell]]s, [[bipolar cells]], [[Retinal ganglion cell|ganglion cells]], [[horizontal cells]], and [[amacrine cells]].\n\nThe basic circuitry of the retina incorporates a three-neuron chain consisting of the photoreceptor (either a [[Rod cell|rod]] or [[Cone cell|cone]]), bipolar cell, and the ganglion cell.\n\nThe first action potential occurs in the retinal ganglion cell. This pathway is the most direct way for transmitting visual information to the brain.\n\nThere are three primary types of photoreceptors: [[Cone cell|Cones]] are photoreceptors that respond significantly to [[color]].  In humans the three different types of cones correspond with a primary response to short wavelength (blue), medium wavelength (green), and long wavelength (yellow/red).<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 2010\">\"eye, human.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 2010.</ref> [[Rod cell|Rods]] are photoreceptors that are very sensitive to the intensity of light, allowing for vision in dim lighting.  The concentrations and ratio of rods to cones is strongly correlated with whether an animal is [[Diurnality|diurnal]] or [[nocturnal]].  In humans, rods outnumber cones by approximately 20:1, while in nocturnal animals, such as the [[tawny owl]], the ratio is closer to 1000:1.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 2010\" /> [[Retinal ganglion cell]]s are involved in the [[sympathetic response]]. Of the ~1.3 million ganglion cells present in the retina, 1-2% are believed to be photosensitive.<ref>Foster, R. G.; Provencio, I.; Hudson, D.; Fiske, S.; Grip, W.; Menaker, M.

Depending on the movement, the hair cell can either hyperpolarize or depolarize. When the movement is towards the tallest [[stereocilia]], the Na<sup>+</sup> cation channels open allowing Na<sup>+</sup> to flow into cell and the resulting depolarization causes the Ca<sup>++</sup> channels to open, thus releasing its neurotransmitter into the afferent auditory nerve. There are two types of hair cells: inner and outer. The inner hair cells are the sensory receptors <!-- the sentence about outer hair cells being from efferent neurons is incorrect -->.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Neuroscience|last=Purves|first=Dale|last2=Augustine|first2=George|last3=Fitzpatrick|first3=David|last4=Hall|first4=William|last5=LaMantia|first5=Anthony-Samuel|last6=McNamara|first6=James|last7=White|first7=Leonard|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=978-0878936977|edition=4|location=|pages=327\u2013330|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nProblems with sensory neurons associated with the auditory system leads to disorders such as:\n* [[Auditory processing disorder]] \u2013 Auditory information in the brain is processed in an abnormal way.

It is a simple device which uses a mirror in a box to create an illusion in which the sensory system perceives that it is seeing two hands instead of one, therefore allowing the sensory system to control the \"phantom limb\".
