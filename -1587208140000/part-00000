The series and several episode scripts were adapted from the \"Dobie Gillis\" short stories written by [[Max Shulman]] since 1945, and first collected in 1951 under the same title as the subsequent TV series. Shulman also wrote a feature film adaptation of his \"Dobie Gillis\" stories for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1953, entitled ''[[The Affairs of Dobie Gillis]]'' which featured [[Bobby Van]] in the title role.\n\n''Dobie Gillis'' is significant as the first American television program produced for a major network to feature teenagers as leading characters. In other series, such as ''[[Father Knows Best]]'' and ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'', teenagers were portrayed as supporting characters in a family story. An even earlier 1954 series, ''[[Meet Corliss Archer (TV series)|Meet Corliss Archer]]'', featured teenagers in leading roles and aired in syndication.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> ''Dobie Gillis'' broke ground by depicting elements of the current  [[counterculture]], particularly the [[Beat Generation]], primarily embodied in a stereotypical version of the \"beatnik\".{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> Series star [[Dwayne Hickman]] would later say that ''Dobie'' represented \u201cthe end of innocence of the 1950s before the oncoming 1960s revolution\u201d.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}\n\n==Overview==\n===Dobie Gillis and Maynard G. Krebs===\n[[File:Dobie gillis 1960.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Dobie Gillis (Dwayne Hickman, left), [[Maynard G. Krebs]] (Bob Denver, right) and one of Dobie's \"many loves\", Yvette LeBlanc ([[Danielle De Metz]]), in a still from the ''Dobie Gillis'' episode \"Parlez-Vous English\", originally aired December 27, 1960]]\nThe series revolved around teenager Dobie Gillis (Dwayne Hickman), who aspired to have popularity, money, and the attention of beautiful and unattainable girls. He did not have any of these qualities in abundance, and the tiny crises surrounding Dobie's lack of success made the story in each weekly episode. Also constantly in question, by Dobie and others, was Dobie's future, as the boy proved to be a poor student and an aimless drifter.\n\nHis sidekick and de facto best friend was American television's first [[beatnik]], [[Maynard G. Krebs]] ([[Bob Denver]]), who became the series' [[breakout character]]. An enthusiastic fan of [[jazz music]] (with a strong distaste for the music of [[Lawrence Welk]]), Maynard plays the [[bongo drum|bongos]], collects tinfoil and petrified frogs, and steers clear of romance, authority figures, and work (yelping \"Work?!\" every time he hears the word). Always speaking with the vernacular and slang of the beatniks and jazz musicians he admired, Maynard punctuates his sentences with the word \"[[Like (discourse particle)|like]]\" and has a tendency towards [[malapropism]]s. The main running gag on ''Dobie Gillis'' would have Dobie or one of the other characters rattling off a series of adjectives describing something undesirable or disgusting (\"I'd be a ragged, useless, dirty wreck!\"), at which point a previously unseen Maynard would appear (entering the scene in close-up), saying \"You rang?\"\n\n''Dobie Gillis'' is set in Central City, a fictitious city in the [[Midwestern United States]] (the original short stories are explicitly set in the [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]] area). One of the show's running gags is the reference, especially by Maynard, to a movie called ''The Monster that Devoured Cleveland'' and its sequels, one of which always seems to be playing at the local cinema.\n\n===Supporting characters===\nDobie's often apoplectic father, Herbert T. Gillis ([[Frank Faylen]]), owned a grocery store and was only happy when Dobie was behind a broom. Dobie's mother, Winifred ([[Florida Friebus]]), was a usually calm and serene woman who protected Dobie to the best of her ability and tended to baby him. Herbert Gillis, a proud, hard-working child of the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]] veteran, was often (during the first season of the show) heard to declare, in relation to Dobie, \"I gotta kill that boy, I just gotta!\" The Gillis family also originally included an older son, Davey Gillis (portrayed by Dwayne Hickman's own older brother, [[Darryl Hickman]]), who made three appearances during the first season while home on break from college before being written out of the show.<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/>\n\nDobie's two main [[antagonist]]s were rich kids Milton Armitage (played by [[Warren Beatty]]), who appeared in five episodes, and, after Beatty's departure, Chatsworth Osborne Jr., Milton's cousin (played by [[Steve Franken]]). Both characters represented the wealth and popularity to which Dobie aspired, but also served as romantic and competitive rivals for Dobie. Beatty's Milton was taller, better looking, and more athletic than Chatsworth. [[Doris Packer]] played Clarissa Osborne, Chatsworth's overbearing and snobbish mother.\n\nDobie was hopelessly attracted to the beautiful but greedy blonde [[Thalia Menninger]] ([[Tuesday Weld]]). Thalia was written out of the series after the first season and was succeeded by a seemingly endless stream of women for whom Dobie hankered. Weld returned as a slightly wiser Thalia for two guest appearances in season 3 and 4.\n\n[[Zelda Gilroy]] ([[Sheila Kuehl|Sheila James]]) was a brilliant and eager young girl, hopelessly in love with Dobie, much to his annoyance. Zelda did not find Dobie particularly attractive, but fell in love with him because she found him helpless and needing of her care, and also because of the concept of \"[[propinquity]]\" (or nearness; as Gillis and Gilroy, they were typically [[Alphabetical order#Ordering by surname|seated together]] in class).<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> Despite his protests, Dobie was clearly fond of Zelda, and Zelda claimed Dobie loved her but just had not realized it yet. To prove this, she would wrinkle her nose at Dobie, who would reflexively do the same back to Zelda and then protest \"now cut that out!\" Dobie and Zelda would later appear as a middle-aged married couple in the two spin-off ''Dobie Gillis'' reunion projects of the 1970s/1980s.\n\nLeander Pomfritt ([[Herbert Anderson]] in the pilot, [[William Schallert]] thereafter) was Dobie's English and science teacher at Central High School and later, when Dobie went to S. Peter Pryor Junior College, Pomfritt (played by Schallert) was on the faculty there as well. A stern educator fond of [[deadpan]] quips, Pomfritt referred to his pupils as \"my young barbarians\" and served as a father figure to both Dobie and Maynard.\n\n===Format===\n[[File:Bob Denver Dobie Gillis 1961.jpg|thumb|Maynard was not prepared to give up his beard after entering the army. Bob Denver and Kay Elhardt are featured in this still from the ''Dobie Gillis'' episode \"The Ballad of Maynard's Beard\", originally aired April 18, 1961.]]\nMost of the action for the first season-and-a-half of ''Dobie Gillis'' centered on the Gillis grocery store, Central High School, and the Central City park. The park scenes are used as the show's [[Frame story|framing device]], with Dobie sitting on a park bench in front of a reproduction of [[Auguste Rodin]]'s statue ''[[The Thinker]]''. Breaking the [[fourth wall]], he would explain to the viewing audience his problem of the week, usually girls or money (in the earliest episodes, Dobie is seen emulating the trademark pose of ''The Thinker'' \u2013 head planted on fist in deep contemplation \u2013 before turning and acknowledging the camera).<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/>\n\nThe teen characters graduated from high school halfway through the second season, and Dobie and Maynard (along with Chatsworth) subsequently did a brief stint in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]].<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/> Dobie continued to break the fourth wall and narrate the episodes, with the park set eschewed for an abstract set with the same reproduction of \"The Thinker.\"\n\nAt the start of the third season, Dobie and Maynard received their Army discharges and they, Zelda, and Chatsworth enroll in S. Peter Pryor [[junior college|Junior College]], where Mr. Pomfritt was now a professor after having resigned from his position at Central High. Dobie's science and history teacher at the college was Dr. Imogene Burkhart ([[Jean Byron]], whose real name was used for that of the character). In season four, Dobie's teenaged cousin Duncan \"Dunky\" Gillis ([[Bobby Diamond]]) moves in with the Gillises, and becomes something of a tag-along for Dobie and Maynard. The fourth-season episodes tended more towards surreal plots and situations featuring Maynard as the central character rather than Dobie.{{sfnp|Denver|1993 |p=56}}\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n*[[Dwayne Hickman]], as Dobie Gillis, is a clean-cut teenager (later young adult), an unremarkable student whose young heart finds poetry and literature resonant. He aspires to have dates with all of the beautiful girls he pursues, despite the pressures of home life, high school, and later the military and college. Dobie also serves as the series narrator, relating his observations to the audience from in front of a statue of Rodin's ''The Thinker''.\n*[[Frank Faylen]], as Herbert T. Gillis, is Dobie's old-fashioned, short-tempered, and gruff father, who runs a small independent grocery store.\n*[[Florida Friebus]], as Winifred \"Winnie\" Gillis, is Dobie's doting mother, who tends to baby her son and critique her husband's parenting skills.\n*[[Bob Denver]], as [[Maynard G. Krebs]], is Dobie's lazy and somewhat goofy best friend, a would-be beatnik who shuns romance, authority figures, and work. Like Dobie does later, Maynard briefly joins the Army in season two between his high-school graduation and enrollment in college.\n\n===Semiregulars===\n*[[Tuesday Weld]], as Thalia Menninger (season 1), is a beautiful high school classmate of Dobie's who is only willing to date Dobie when he has money or helps her in her schemes to make some for herself (with a father in poor health and a sister who married a layabout, Thalia sees it as her duty to bring some money into the family; she acknowledges that were this not a factor, she would date Dobie).<ref>The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, episode 1- 'Caper at the Bijou'</ref> Weld departed the series after the first season, later returning to make two guest appearances, as a somewhat chastened Thalia, once in season 3 and once in season 4.\n*[[Warren Beatty]], as Milton Armitage (season 1), is a rich jock at Dobie's high school and a rival of Dobie for Thalia's affections. Beatty quit the series midway through the first season.\n*[[Sheila Kuehl|Sheila James]], as [[Zelda Gilroy]], is the smartest girl in Dobie's high school and college, who is in love with the uninterested Dobie and schemes ways to get him to date and marry her.\n*[[Steve Franken]], as [[Chatsworth Osborne, Jr.]], is a spoiled rich boy and a classmate of Dobie's in high school and college. Chatsworth assumed the role left vacant by the departure of Milton from the series. Like Dobie, Chatsworth also briefly joins the Army in season two between his high-school graduation and enrollment in college.\n*[[William Schallert]], as Professor Leander Pomfritt, is a dry wit English and science teacher at Dobie's high school and later one of Dobie's college professors at S. Peter Pryor Junior College (seasons 1, 2 and 3). [[Herbert Anderson]] plays Mr. Pomfritt in the pilot episode.\n*[[Jean Byron]], as Mrs. Ruth Adams, is Dobie's math teacher in high school (season 1) and Dr. Imogene Burkhart, one of Dobie's professors at S. Peter Pryor Junior College. (seasons 3 and 4). One of the series inside jokes was that Jean Byron's birth name was Imogene Audette Burkhart.\n*[[Doris Packer]], as Mrs. Clarice Armitage, is Milton's mother, a rich and eccentric socialite. She shifted to Mrs. Clarissa Osborne ([[Chatsworth Osborne, Jr.]]'s mother) when Franken replaced Beatty midway through season one. She has disdain for anyone outside her social class and considers all boys, including her own son, as \"nasty\".\n\n===Notable recurring roles===\n*[[Darryl Hickman]], as Davey Gillis (season 1), is Dobie's older brother, a college student no more responsible and no less girl-crazy than Dobie. Davey was written out of the series after season one and Dobie is regarded as an only child thereafter.\n*[[Michael J. Pollard]], as Jerome Krebs (season 1), is Maynard's cousin, also a beatnik. Jerome was intended as a replacement for Maynard when Bob Denver was drafted in mid-1959, and was written out of the show after Denver failed his Army physical and returned to the series.\n*[[Marjorie Bennett]], as Blossom Kenney (seasons 1 and 2), is a frequent and persnickety customer of the Gillises' grocery store.\n*[[Tommy Farrell]], as Riff Ryan (seasons 1 and 2), is a beatnik record store owner and coffee house proprietor who serves as something of a reluctant mentor for Maynard.\n*[[Lynn Loring]], as Edwina \"Eddie\" Kegel (season 3), Chatsworth Osborne Jr.'s [[beatnik]] cousin.\n*[[Raymond Bailey]], as Dean McGruder (seasons 3 and 4), is head of S. Peter Pryor Junior College.\n\n==Episodes== \n{{Main|List of The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis episodes}}\n{{:List of The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis episodes}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Rodin-Denker-Kyoto.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Auguste Rodin]]'s statue of ''[[The Thinker]]'']]\nMax Shulman's first Dobie Gillis short stories were printed in 1945, and a short story compilation, ''The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'', was published in 1951.<ref name=\"skuehlvideo\" /> These stories were originally published in such magazines as ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.\n\nA follow-up collection, ''I Was a Teen-age Dwarf'', appeared in 1959.

Following its release, Shulman set about attempting to bring ''Dobie Gillis'' to television. An initial pilot was produced by veteran comedian and producer [[George Burns]] in 1957, with his son [[Ronnie Burns (actor)|Ronnie Burns]] starring as Dobie.<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/>\n\nAfter this pilot did not sell, Shulman took ''Dobie Gillis'' to [[20th Century Fox Television]], run at the time by [[Martin Manulis]]. Manulis asked Shulman to reduce the Dobie character's age from 19 to 17, making him a high-school student instead of a college student and an age peer of [[Ricky Nelson]] from ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'' and [[Wally Cleaver]] ([[Tony Dow]]) from ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]''.<ref name=\"HoneyImHome\">Jones, Gerard (1993).

Krebs, and Tuesday Weld as Dobie's unattainable love interest Thalia Menninger.\n\nFirst pitched to and rejected by NBC, ''The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'' was greenlit for series by CBS. [[Philip Morris USA|Phillip Morris]]' [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] was the program's primary sponsor, and it sold a week-to-week alternating co-sponsorship to [[Pillsbury Company]] for the first two seasons, with Dwayne Hickman appearing in one of the Pillsbury commercials.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> [[Colgate-Palmolive]] replaced Pillsbury as the alternate sponsor in season three.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/>\n\nWhile the pilot for ''The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'' was shot at the main [[20th Century Fox]] lot in [[Century City, California]], principal photography and production for the series proper took place at the original Fox Film Corporation studio at the intersection of [[Sunset Boulevard]] and [[Western Avenue (Los Angeles)|Western Avenue]] (next to the headquarters of [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group Inc.|DeLuxe]]) in [[Hollywood]].<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/> ''Dobie Gillis'' was [[multi-camera setup|filmed with two cameras]], a method that producer and director [[Rod Amateau]] had learned while working on ''[[The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]]''. Fox turned out one episode of ''Dobie Gillis'' a week, working from May to December of each year. Dwayne Hickman's fourth-wall-breaking monologues were saved for the end of the production of each episode; their length resulted in Hickman requesting and getting a [[teleprompter]] from which to read them for season two forward.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}\n\nThe show was not filmed before a [[live studio audience]]; during the first season, a live audience viewed each episode and provided its [[laugh track]].<ref name=\"tweedle20100610\">{{cite interview|title=Hollywood Everyman: A Conversation with William Schallert|date=June 10, 2010|accessdate=December 12, 2011|url=http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/williamschallerti|last=Schallert|first=William|subjectlink=William Schallert|interviewer=Tweedle, Sam|work=Confessions of a Pop Culture Addict|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117134300/http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/williamschallerti/|archivedate=January 17, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Subsequent seasons used a standard laugh track provided by technician [[Charles Douglass]].{{sfnp|Denver|1993 |pp=9\u201321}}\n\nCreator Max Shulman served as the show runner for and an uncredited producer of ''Dobie Gillis''.<ref name=\"STUEP5\">{{cite web |last=Shostak |first=Stu |date=Nov 3, 2010 |url=http://www.stusshow.com/archives.php |title=Program 202 \u2014 Steve Franken |website=The Stu's Show Archives |access-date=Sep 9, 2013}}</ref> He contributed scripts for episodes of the show during all four seasons, with several stories \u2013 including \"Love is a Science\" (season 1, episode 3), \"Love is a Fallacy\" (season 1, episode 22), and \"Parlez-Vous English\" (season 2, episode 11) \u2013 directly adapted by Shulman from his original Dobie Gillis short stories.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/><ref name=\"STUEP5\"/>\n\nDuring its fourth season, the show, by then known as ''Max Shulman's Dobie Gillis'', suffered both from competition with NBC's color Western ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' and from the growing inattention from Max Shulman.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Shulman began spending increasing amounts of time at his home in [[Westport, Connecticut]] while the show was in active production,{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}<ref name=\"STUEP5\"/> ceding his role as show runner to associate producers Joel Kane and Guy Scarpitta.

Faylen's gruff, no-nonsense father character \u2013 which, according to Hickman, was essentially the same as Faylen's real-life personality{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} \u2013 was more of an antagonist to Dobie during the first season of the show, his demeanor underscored by his often-repeated catchphrase \"I gotta kill that boy! I just gotta!\" Both CBS and Marlboro strongly disapproved of the catchphrase and the Herbert T. Gillis character's hard edges.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} An early season-two episode, \"You Ain't Nothin' But a Houn' Dog\" (episode 2), in which Dobie inadvertently wins a father-and-son essay contest, was produced to explain why Herbert ceased use of his catchphrase. Herbert was further softened as the series bore on, the character's anger tempered to frustration.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Recurring casting notes===\nExperienced child actress Tuesday Weld was cast as Dobie's love interest in \"Caper at the Bijou\" and stayed on as a semiregular. Weld and Dwayne Hickman had previously appeared as a teenage couple in the 1958 Fox feature film ''[[Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys!]]'', based on a Max Shulman novel, though produced without his input.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Neither Hickman nor Weld was fond of the other, with Hickman later stating he felt Weld was not as dedicated as necessary to rehearsal and referring to her as \"a pain in the neck\". Weld reportedly found Hickman pushy and out-of-touch. Aged 15 at the time of shooting the pilot, Weld had to legally spend much of her time onset in school with a tutor,{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} and the production periodically ran into issues involving Weld's later publicly known difficult home life.<ref name=\"skuehlvideo\">{{Cite video |title=Interview with Sheila James Kuehl |medium=Video |publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Foundation]] |date=2013 |url=http://emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/sheila-kuehl}}</ref> \n\nHer work in ''Dobie Gillis'' and the feature film ''[[The Five Pennies]]'' made Weld a star, leading to substantial publicity.{{sfnp|Denver|1993 |pp=9\u201321}} She departed the series after the first year to star in features, although she was persuaded by Max Shulman to return for two guest appearances, \"Birth of a Salesman\" (season 3, episode 21) and \"What's a Little Murder Between Friends?\" (season 4, episode 2).{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}\n\nHerbert Anderson was cast as Mr. Pomfritt, Dobie and Maynard's English teacher at school. Anderson appeared in a lead role in the pilot for ''[[Dennis the Menace (1959 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]''; when that show was picked up (also by CBS), he chose to stay with that cast, and veteran actor William Schallert appeared in the recurring role of Mr. Pomfritt through the end of season three.\n\nWarren Beatty was cast as Milton Armitage, a recurring rival of Dobie's at his high school, during the first half of season one.<ref name=\"Beatty\"/> Hickman later recalled that Beatty \"looked at me like I was a bug\" while on set.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Beatty did remain friends with his brief co-star [[Michael J. Pollard]]. The two co-starred in ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' eight years later. He quit the series in September 1959, midway through production of the first season after filming his fifth and final ''Dobie'' episode, \"The Smoke-Filled Room\", to appear in ''A Loss of Roses'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].<ref name=\"Beatty\">Finstead, Susan (2008).

Signing a contract with ''Dobie Gillis'' necessitated James, then an eighteen-year-old college student, changing her major from theater to English, so Shulman could assist her with her studies on set.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/>\n\nAfter the third season of ''Dobie Gillis'', Rod Amateau and Max Shulman produced a pilot for a ''Zelda'' spinoff starring Sheila James as Zelda Gilroy, with [[Joe Flynn (US actor)|Joe Flynn]] and Jean Byron cast as her parents.<ref name=\"STUEP3\">{{cite web |last=Shostak |first=Stu |date=July 17, 2013 |url=http://www.stusshow.com/archives.php?y=2013 |title=Program 331 \u2014 Sheila James Kuehl |website=The Stu's Show Archives |access-date=July 25, 2013}}</ref> However, CBS president [[James Aubrey]] lingered over moving forward with the ''Zelda'' series for a long time before firmly rejecting the series, with Amateau telling James in private that Aubrey had found ''Zelda'' (and by extension James, then a closeted lesbian) \"too butch\".<ref name=\"skuehlvideo\"/> James' contract for the pilot and the resulting waiting period caused her to be absent from much of the fourth and final season of ''Dobie Gillis'', though Amateau was able to hire her to return as Zelda for four episodes towards the end of the season.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> Acting roles became sparse for James by the late 1960s; she went into law and politics under her birth name of Sheila Kuehl and later became the first openly gay person elected to the [[California State Legislature]].<ref name=\"skuehlvideo\"/>\n\nSteve Franken, a 28-year-old veteran character actor, was cast immediately after Beatty's departure as Chatsworth Osbourne, Jr, a replacement character for Milton Armitage. While both Milton and Chatsworth were rich rivals of Dobie Gillis (and both characters shared the same actress, [[Doris Packer]], for a mother) and were, according to canon, cousins, where Beatty's Milton was a menacing and athletic physical threat, Franken's pompous, foppish Chatsworth tended to plot and scheme his way through competitions with Dobie, more often than not using his riches to get ahead.<ref name=\"STUEP5\"/> The Chatsworth character became popular enough that the producers had to consciously limit his appearances on the series to roughly one per month to prevent Franken from upstaging Hickman and Denver, but Franken stated both during and after ''Dobie Gillis'' that playing Chatsworth led him to be typecast and stifled his career.<ref name=\"STUEP5\"/>\n\nYoung actor Bobby Diamond was brought on at the beginning of season four as Dobie's teenaged cousin, Duncan \"Dunky\" Gillis. By 1962, the 28-year-old Dwayne Hickman had begun to look too mature to carry the teenager-based plot lines,{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} and instead Diamond's \"Dunky\" was given this material, with the older yet immature Maynard as a running partner. The character was dropped midway through the fourth season, with attention shifting back to the characters of Dobie, Maynard, Chatsworth, and Zelda for the remaining episodes of the series.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}\n\nActresses who played Dobie's love interests included [[Cheryl Holdridge]], [[Michele Lee]], [[Susan Watson]], [[Marlo Thomas]], [[Sally Kellerman]], [[Ellen Burstyn]] (then billed as Ellen McRae), [[Barbara Babcock]], [[Sherry Jackson]] and [[Danielle De Metz]]. [[Yvonne Craig]] appeared in the opening credits and the closing sequence of the pilot film used to sell the series to CBS but did not appear in the actual episode, \"Caper at The Bijou\", when it was broadcast. She would eventually play five different girlfriends on the show, more than any other actress.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Other media==\nAfter the first season of ''The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'' had aired, [[Capitol Records]] attempted to make a recording star out of Dwayne Hickman, ignoring the fact that Hickman, by his own admission, was not a singer.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Recording engineers had to piece together numerous takes to get a usable vocal track from Hickman for each song. Hickman introduced several of the songs from the ''Dobie!'' album on the show during its second season, including \"I'm a Lover, Not a Fighter\" and \"Don't Send a Rabbit\".{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Earlier, while Hickman was appearing on ''[[Love That Bob]]'', he had recorded a single, \"School Dance\", for [[ABC-Paramount Records]], but both the single and the later Capitol album sold very few copies.<ref>[http://www.famousinterview.ca/interviews/dwayne_hickman.htm Dwayne Hickman interview], famousinterview.ca; accessed February 7, 2016.</ref>\n\n[[DC Comics]] published a ''Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'' comic book that ran for 26 issues from 1960 to 1964, featuring artwork by [[Bob Oksner]].

The series and several episode scripts were adapted from the \"Dobie Gillis\" short stories written by [[Max Shulman]] since 1945, and first collected in 1951 under the same title as the subsequent TV series.

In other series, such as ''[[Father Knows Best]]'' and ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'', teenagers were portrayed as supporting characters in a family story. An even earlier 1954 series, ''[[Meet Corliss Archer (TV series)|Meet Corliss Archer]]'', featured teenagers in leading roles and aired in syndication.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> ''Dobie Gillis'' broke ground by depicting elements of the current  [[counterculture]], particularly the [[Beat Generation]], primarily embodied in a stereotypical version of the \"beatnik\".{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> Series star [[Dwayne Hickman]] would later say that ''Dobie'' represented \u201cthe end of innocence of the 1950s before the oncoming 1960s revolution\u201d.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}\n\n==Overview==\n===Dobie Gillis and Maynard G. Krebs===\n[[File:Dobie gillis 1960.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Dobie Gillis (Dwayne Hickman, left), [[Maynard G. Krebs]] (Bob Denver, right) and one of Dobie's \"many loves\", Yvette LeBlanc ([[Danielle De Metz]]), in a still from the ''Dobie Gillis'' episode \"Parlez-Vous English\", originally aired December 27, 1960]]\nThe series revolved around teenager Dobie Gillis (Dwayne Hickman), who aspired to have popularity, money, and the attention of beautiful and unattainable girls. He did not have any of these qualities in abundance, and the tiny crises surrounding Dobie's lack of success made the story in each weekly episode. Also constantly in question, by Dobie and others, was Dobie's future, as the boy proved to be a poor student and an aimless drifter.\n\nHis sidekick and de facto best friend was American television's first [[beatnik]], [[Maynard G. Krebs]] ([[Bob Denver]]), who became the series' [[breakout character]]. An enthusiastic fan of [[jazz music]] (with a strong distaste for the music of [[Lawrence Welk]]), Maynard plays the [[bongo drum|bongos]], collects tinfoil and petrified frogs, and steers clear of romance, authority figures, and work (yelping \"Work?!\" every time he hears the word). Always speaking with the vernacular and slang of the beatniks and jazz musicians he admired, Maynard punctuates his sentences with the word \"[[Like (discourse particle)|like]]\" and has a tendency towards [[malapropism]]s. The main running gag on ''Dobie Gillis'' would have Dobie or one of the other characters rattling off a series of adjectives describing something undesirable or disgusting (\"I'd be a ragged, useless, dirty wreck!\"), at which point a previously unseen Maynard would appear (entering the scene in close-up), saying \"You rang?\"\n\n''Dobie Gillis'' is set in Central City, a fictitious city in the [[Midwestern United States]] (the original short stories are explicitly set in the [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]] area). One of the show's running gags is the reference, especially by Maynard, to a movie called ''The Monster that Devoured Cleveland'' and its sequels, one of which always seems to be playing at the local cinema.\n\n===Supporting characters===\nDobie's often apoplectic father, Herbert T. Gillis ([[Frank Faylen]]), owned a grocery store and was only happy when Dobie was behind a broom. Dobie's mother, Winifred ([[Florida Friebus]]), was a usually calm and serene woman who protected Dobie to the best of her ability and tended to baby him. Herbert Gillis, a proud, hard-working child of the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]] veteran, was often (during the first season of the show) heard to declare, in relation to Dobie, \"I gotta kill that boy, I just gotta!\" The Gillis family also originally included an older son, Davey Gillis (portrayed by Dwayne Hickman's own older brother, [[Darryl Hickman]]), who made three appearances during the first season while home on break from college before being written out of the show.<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/>\n\nDobie's two main [[antagonist]]s were rich kids Milton Armitage (played by [[Warren Beatty]]), who appeared in five episodes, and, after Beatty's departure, Chatsworth Osborne Jr., Milton's cousin (played by [[Steve Franken]]). Both characters represented the wealth and popularity to which Dobie aspired, but also served as romantic and competitive rivals for Dobie. Beatty's Milton was taller, better looking, and more athletic than Chatsworth. [[Doris Packer]] played Clarissa Osborne, Chatsworth's overbearing and snobbish mother.\n\nDobie was hopelessly attracted to the beautiful but greedy blonde [[Thalia Menninger]] ([[Tuesday Weld]]). Thalia was written out of the series after the first season and was succeeded by a seemingly endless stream of women for whom Dobie hankered. Weld returned as a slightly wiser Thalia for two guest appearances in season 3 and 4.\n\n[[Zelda Gilroy]] ([[Sheila Kuehl|Sheila James]]) was a brilliant and eager young girl, hopelessly in love with Dobie, much to his annoyance. Zelda did not find Dobie particularly attractive, but fell in love with him because she found him helpless and needing of her care, and also because of the concept of \"[[propinquity]]\" (or nearness; as Gillis and Gilroy, they were typically [[Alphabetical order#Ordering by surname|seated together]] in class).<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> Despite his protests, Dobie was clearly fond of Zelda, and Zelda claimed Dobie loved her but just had not realized it yet. To prove this, she would wrinkle her nose at Dobie, who would reflexively do the same back to Zelda and then protest \"now cut that out!\" Dobie and Zelda would later appear as a middle-aged married couple in the two spin-off ''Dobie Gillis'' reunion projects of the 1970s/1980s.\n\nLeander Pomfritt ([[Herbert Anderson]] in the pilot, [[William Schallert]] thereafter) was Dobie's English and science teacher at Central High School and later, when Dobie went to S. Peter Pryor Junior College, Pomfritt (played by Schallert) was on the faculty there as well. A stern educator fond of [[deadpan]] quips, Pomfritt referred to his pupils as \"my young barbarians\" and served as a father figure to both Dobie and Maynard.\n\n===Format===\n[[File:Bob Denver Dobie Gillis 1961.jpg|thumb|Maynard was not prepared to give up his beard after entering the army. Bob Denver and Kay Elhardt are featured in this still from the ''Dobie Gillis'' episode \"The Ballad of Maynard's Beard\", originally aired April 18, 1961.]]\nMost of the action for the first season-and-a-half of ''Dobie Gillis'' centered on the Gillis grocery store, Central High School, and the Central City park. The park scenes are used as the show's [[Frame story|framing device]], with Dobie sitting on a park bench in front of a reproduction of [[Auguste Rodin]]'s statue ''[[The Thinker]]''. Breaking the [[fourth wall]], he would explain to the viewing audience his problem of the week, usually girls or money (in the earliest episodes, Dobie is seen emulating the trademark pose of ''The Thinker'' \u2013 head planted on fist in deep contemplation \u2013 before turning and acknowledging the camera).<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/>\n\nThe teen characters graduated from high school halfway through the second season, and Dobie and Maynard (along with Chatsworth) subsequently did a brief stint in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]].<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/> Dobie continued to break the fourth wall and narrate the episodes, with the park set eschewed for an abstract set with the same reproduction of \"The Thinker.\"\n\nAt the start of the third season, Dobie and Maynard received their Army discharges and they, Zelda, and Chatsworth enroll in S. Peter Pryor [[junior college|Junior College]], where Mr. Pomfritt was now a professor after having resigned from his position at Central High. Dobie's science and history teacher at the college was Dr. Imogene Burkhart ([[Jean Byron]], whose real name was used for that of the character). In season four, Dobie's teenaged cousin Duncan \"Dunky\" Gillis ([[Bobby Diamond]]) moves in with the Gillises, and becomes something of a tag-along for Dobie and Maynard. The fourth-season episodes tended more towards surreal plots and situations featuring Maynard as the central character rather than Dobie.{{sfnp|Denver|1993 |p=56}}\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n*[[Dwayne Hickman]], as Dobie Gillis, is a clean-cut teenager (later young adult), an unremarkable student whose young heart finds poetry and literature resonant. He aspires to have dates with all of the beautiful girls he pursues, despite the pressures of home life, high school, and later the military and college. Dobie also serves as the series narrator, relating his observations to the audience from in front of a statue of Rodin's ''The Thinker''.\n*[[Frank Faylen]], as Herbert T. Gillis, is Dobie's old-fashioned, short-tempered, and gruff father, who runs a small independent grocery store.\n*[[Florida Friebus]], as Winifred \"Winnie\" Gillis, is Dobie's doting mother, who tends to baby her son and critique her husband's parenting skills.\n*[[Bob Denver]], as [[Maynard G. Krebs]], is Dobie's lazy and somewhat goofy best friend, a would-be beatnik who shuns romance, authority figures, and work. Like Dobie does later, Maynard briefly joins the Army in season two between his high-school graduation and enrollment in college.\n\n===Semiregulars===\n*[[Tuesday Weld]], as Thalia Menninger (season 1), is a beautiful high school classmate of Dobie's who is only willing to date Dobie when he has money or helps her in her schemes to make some for herself (with a father in poor health and a sister who married a layabout, Thalia sees it as her duty to bring some money into the family; she acknowledges that were this not a factor, she would date Dobie).<ref>The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, episode 1- 'Caper at the Bijou'</ref> Weld departed the series after the first season, later returning to make two guest appearances, as a somewhat chastened Thalia, once in season 3 and once in season 4.\n*[[Warren Beatty]], as Milton Armitage (season 1), is a rich jock at Dobie's high school and a rival of Dobie for Thalia's affections. Beatty quit the series midway through the first season.\n*[[Sheila Kuehl|Sheila James]], as [[Zelda Gilroy]], is the smartest girl in Dobie's high school and college, who is in love with the uninterested Dobie and schemes ways to get him to date and marry her.\n*[[Steve Franken]], as [[Chatsworth Osborne, Jr.]], is a spoiled rich boy and a classmate of Dobie's in high school and college. Chatsworth assumed the role left vacant by the departure of Milton from the series. Like Dobie, Chatsworth also briefly joins the Army in season two between his high-school graduation and enrollment in college.\n*[[William Schallert]], as Professor Leander Pomfritt, is a dry wit English and science teacher at Dobie's high school and later one of Dobie's college professors at S. Peter Pryor Junior College (seasons 1, 2 and 3). [[Herbert Anderson]] plays Mr. Pomfritt in the pilot episode.\n*[[Jean Byron]], as Mrs. Ruth Adams, is Dobie's math teacher in high school (season 1) and Dr. Imogene Burkhart, one of Dobie's professors at S. Peter Pryor Junior College. (seasons 3 and 4). One of the series inside jokes was that Jean Byron's birth name was Imogene Audette Burkhart.\n*[[Doris Packer]], as Mrs. Clarice Armitage, is Milton's mother, a rich and eccentric socialite. She shifted to Mrs. Clarissa Osborne ([[Chatsworth Osborne, Jr.]]'s mother) when Franken replaced Beatty midway through season one. She has disdain for anyone outside her social class and considers all boys, including her own son, as \"nasty\".\n\n===Notable recurring roles===\n*[[Darryl Hickman]], as Davey Gillis (season 1), is Dobie's older brother, a college student no more responsible and no less girl-crazy than Dobie. Davey was written out of the series after season one and Dobie is regarded as an only child thereafter.\n*[[Michael J. Pollard]], as Jerome Krebs (season 1), is Maynard's cousin, also a beatnik. Jerome was intended as a replacement for Maynard when Bob Denver was drafted in mid-1959, and was written out of the show after Denver failed his Army physical and returned to the series.\n*[[Marjorie Bennett]], as Blossom Kenney (seasons 1 and 2), is a frequent and persnickety customer of the Gillises' grocery store.\n*[[Tommy Farrell]], as Riff Ryan (seasons 1 and 2), is a beatnik record store owner and coffee house proprietor who serves as something of a reluctant mentor for Maynard.\n*[[Lynn Loring]], as Edwina \"Eddie\" Kegel (season 3), Chatsworth Osborne Jr.'s [[beatnik]] cousin.\n*[[Raymond Bailey]], as Dean McGruder (seasons 3 and 4), is head of S. Peter Pryor Junior College.\n\n==Episodes== \n{{Main|List of The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis episodes}}\n{{:List of The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis episodes}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Rodin-Denker-Kyoto.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Auguste Rodin]]'s statue of ''[[The Thinker]]'']]\nMax Shulman's first Dobie Gillis short stories were printed in 1945, and a short story compilation, ''The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'', was published in 1951.<ref name=\"skuehlvideo\" /> These stories were originally published in such magazines as ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.\n\nA follow-up collection, ''I Was a Teen-Age Dwarf'', appeared in 1959.

Signing a contract with ''Dobie Gillis'' necessitated James, then an eighteen-year-old college student, changing her major from theater to English, so Shulman could assist her with her studies on set.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/>\n\nAfter the third season of ''Dobie Gillis'', Rod Amateau and Max Shulman produced a pilot for a ''Zelda'' spinoff starring Sheila James as Zelda Gilroy, with [[Joe Flynn (US actor)|Joe Flynn]] and Jean Byron cast as her parents.<ref name=\"STUEP3\">{{cite web |last=Shostak |first=Stu |date=July 17, 2013 |url=http://www.stusshow.com/archives.php?y=2013 |title=Program 331 \u2014 Sheila James Kuehl |website=The Stu's Show Archives |access-date=July 25, 2013}}</ref> However, CBS president [[James Aubrey]] lingered over moving forward with the ''Zelda'' series for a long time before firmly rejecting the series, with Amateau telling James in private that Aubrey had found ''Zelda'' (and by extension James, then a closeted lesbian) \"too butch\".<ref name=\"skuehlvideo\"/> James' contract for the pilot and the resulting waiting period caused her to be absent from much of the fourth and final season of ''Dobie Gillis'', though Amateau was able to hire her to return as Zelda for four episodes towards the end of the season.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/> Acting roles became sparse for James by the late 1960s; she went into law and politics under her birth name of Sheila Kuehl and later became the first openly gay person elected to the [[California State Legislature]].<ref name=\"skuehlvideo\"/>\n\nSteve Franken, a 28-year-old veteran character actor, was cast immediately after Beatty's departure as Chatsworth Osbourne, Jr, a replacement character for Milton Armitage. While both Milton and Chatsworth were rich rivals of Dobie Gillis (and both characters shared the same actress, [[Doris Packer]], for a mother) and were, according to canon, cousins, where Beatty's Milton was a menacing and athletic physical threat, Franken's pompous, foppish Chatsworth tended to plot and scheme his way through competitions with Dobie, more often than not using his riches to get ahead.<ref name=\"STUEP5\"/> The Chatsworth character became popular enough that the producers had to consciously limit his appearances on the series to roughly one per month to prevent Franken from upstaging Hickman and Denver, but Franken stated both during and after ''Dobie Gillis'' that playing Chatsworth led him to be typecast and stifled his career.<ref name=\"STUEP5\"/>\n\nYoung actor Bobby Diamond was brought on at the beginning of season four as Dobie's teenaged cousin, Duncan \"Dunky\" Gillis. By 1962, the 28-year-old Dwayne Hickman had begun to look too mature to carry the teenager-based plot lines,{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} and instead Diamond's \"Dunky\" was given this material, with the older yet immature Maynard as a running partner. The character was dropped midway through the fourth season, with attention shifting back to the characters of Dobie, Maynard, Chatsworth, and Zelda for the remaining episodes of the series.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}}\n\nActresses who played Dobie's love interests included [[Cheryl Holdridge]], [[Michele Lee]], [[Susan Watson]], [[Marlo Thomas]], [[Sally Kellerman]], [[Ellen Burstyn]] (then billed as Ellen McRae), [[Barbara Babcock]], [[Sherry Jackson]] and [[Danielle De Metz]]. [[Yvonne Craig]] appeared in the opening credits and the closing sequence of the pilot film used to sell the series to CBS but did not appear in the actual episode, \"Caper at The Bijou\", when it was broadcast. She would eventually play five different girlfriends on the show, more than any other actress.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Other media==\nAfter the first season of ''The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'' had aired, [[Capitol Records]] attempted to make a recording star out of Dwayne Hickman, ignoring the fact that Hickman, by his own admission, was not a singer.{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Recording engineers had to piece together numerous takes to get a usable vocal track from Hickman for each song. Hickman introduced several of the songs from the ''Dobie!'' album on the show during its second season, including \"I'm a Lover, Not a Fighter\" and \"Don't Send a Rabbit\".{{sfnp|Hickman|1994 |pp=104\u2013159}} Earlier, while Hickman was appearing on ''[[Love That Bob]]'', he had recorded a single, \"School Dance\", for [[ABC-Paramount Records]], but both the single and the later Capitol album sold very few copies.<ref>[http://www.famousinterview.ca/interviews/dwayne_hickman.htm Dwayne Hickman interview], famousinterview.ca; accessed February 7, 2016.</ref>\n\n[[DC Comics]] published a ''Many Loves of Dobie Gillis'' comic book that ran for 26 issues from 1960 to 1964, featuring artwork by [[Bob Oksner]]. Stories from this comic book series would later be reprinted, with updates to the artwork and lettering to remove any references to ''Dobie Gillis'', by DC as a short-lived series entitled ''Windy and Willy'' in 1969.<ref>[http://toonopedia.com/windywil.htm \"Windy and Willy\"] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

(1977) and the [[TV movie]] ''Bring Me the Head of Dobie Gillis'' (1988). ''Whatever Happened to Dobie Gillis?'' was an unsuccessful pilot for a new weekly sitcom series, which was produced, directed, and developed by [[James Komack]] after creator Max Shulman was fired from the production.<ref name=\"STUEP4\"/> It was broadcast by CBS on May 10, 1977, as a one-shot special.

Cherry after Dwayne Hickman, who was the film's producer, was forced by the network to fire Max Shulman and Rod Amateau, with whom he had originally conceived the film.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/><ref name=\"STUEP4\"/> The plot features the married Dobie and Zelda running the Gillis Grocery \u2013 now also a pharmacy \u2013 on their own, Dobie's parents having died. Meanwhile, Thalia (played by [[Connie Stevens]] after Weld declined to reprise the role) returns to Central City \u2013 with Maynard, whom she has rescued from a deserted island \u2013 after 20 years (an homage to ''[[Gilligan's Island]]''), and offers a $50,000 bounty to anyone who will kill Dobie when he refuses to divorce Zelda and marry her. Hickman, Denver, and James returned for ''Bring Me the Head of Dobie Gillis'', which featured Steve Franken as Chatsworth, WIlliam Schallert as Mr. Pomfritt, and [[Scott Grimes]] as son Georgie Gillis.<ref name=\"STUEP3\"/><ref name=\"STUEP4\"/> [[Connie Stevens]]' daughter, [[Tricia Leigh Fisher]], played Chatsworth's daughter Chatsie, who chased Georgie Gillis with the same zeal Zelda had once used chasing Dobie.\n\n==Home media==\nOn July 2, 2013, [[Shout!
