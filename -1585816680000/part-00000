Quartz and Rochelle salt exhibited the most piezoelectricity.\n\n[[Image:SchemaPiezo.gif|thumb|A piezoelectric disk generates a voltage when deformed (change in shape is greatly exaggerated).]]\n\nThe Curies, however, did not predict the converse piezoelectric effect.

More work was done to explore and define the crystal structures that exhibited piezoelectricity. This culminated in 1910 with the publication of [[Woldemar Voigt]]'s ''Lehrbuch der Kristallphysik'' (''Textbook on Crystal Physics''),<ref>{{cite book |first=Woldemar |last=Voigt |author-link=Woldemar Voigt |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SvPPAAAAMAAJ&pg=PR1#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Lehrbuch der Kristallphysik |location=Berlin |publisher=B.

In [[France]] in 1917, [[Paul Langevin]] and his coworkers developed an [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] [[submarine]] detector.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Who knew piezoelectricity? Rutherford and Langevin on submarine detection and the invention of sonar |last= Katzir |first= S. |journal= Notes Rec. R. Soc. |date= 2012 |volume= 66 |issue= 2 |pages= 141\u2013157 |doi= 10.1098/rsnr.2011.0049 }}</ref> The detector consisted of a [[transducer]], made of thin quartz crystals carefully glued between two steel plates, and a [[hydrophone]] to detect the returned [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]]. By emitting a high-frequency pulse from the transducer, and measuring the amount of time it takes to hear an echo from the sound waves bouncing off an object, one can calculate the distance to that object.\n\nThe use of piezoelectricity in sonar, and the success of that project, created intense development interest in piezoelectric devices. Over the next few decades, new piezoelectric materials and new applications for those materials were explored and developed.\n\nPiezoelectric devices found homes in many fields. Ceramic [[phonograph]] cartridges simplified player design, were cheap and accurate, and made record players cheaper to maintain and easier to build. The development of the ultrasonic transducer allowed for easy measurement of viscosity and elasticity in fluids and solids, resulting in huge advances in materials research. Ultrasonic [[time-domain reflectometer]]s (which send an ultrasonic pulse through a material and measure reflections from discontinuities) could find flaws inside cast metal and stone objects, improving structural safety.\n\n===World War II and post-war===\nDuring [[World War II]], independent research groups in the [[United States]], [[Russia]], and [[Japan]] discovered a new class of synthetic materials, called [[ferroelectricity|ferroelectrics]], which exhibited piezoelectric constants many times higher than natural materials. This led to intense research to develop [[barium titanate]] and later lead zirconate titanate materials with specific properties for particular applications.\n\nOne significant example of the use of piezoelectric crystals was developed by Bell Telephone Laboratories. Following World War I, Frederick R. Lack, working in radio telephony in the engineering department, developed the \"AT cut\" crystal, a crystal that operated through a wide range of temperatures. Lack's crystal did not need the heavy accessories previous crystal used, facilitating its use on aircraft. This development allowed Allied air forces to engage in coordinated mass attacks through the use of aviation radio.\n\nDevelopment of piezoelectric devices and materials in the United States was kept within the companies doing the development, mostly due to the wartime beginnings of the field, and in the interests of securing profitable patents. New materials were the first to be developed\u2014quartz crystals were the first commercially exploited piezoelectric material, but scientists searched for higher-performance materials. Despite the advances in materials and the maturation of manufacturing processes, the United States market did not grow as quickly as Japan's did. Without many new applications, the growth of the United States' piezoelectric industry suffered.\n\nIn contrast, Japanese manufacturers shared their information, quickly overcoming technical and manufacturing challenges and creating new markets. In Japan, a temperature stable crystal cut was developed by [[Issac Koga]]. Japanese efforts in materials research created piezoceramic materials competitive to the United States materials but free of expensive patent restrictions. Major Japanese piezoelectric developments included new designs of piezoceramic filters for radios and televisions, piezo buzzers and audio transducers that can connect directly to electronic circuits, and the [[piezo ignition|piezoelectric igniter]], which generates sparks for small engine ignition systems and gas-grill lighters, by compressing a ceramic disc. Ultrasonic transducers that transmit sound waves through air had existed for quite some time but first saw major commercial use in early television remote controls. These transducers now are mounted on several [[automobile|car]] models as an [[Acoustic location|echolocation]] device, helping the driver determine the distance from the car to any objects that may be in its path.\n\n==Mechanism==\n[[File:Piezo bending principle.jpg|thumb|Piezoelectric plate used to convert [[audio signal]] to sound waves]]\nThe nature of the piezoelectric effect is closely related to the occurrence of [[electric dipole moment]]s in solids. The latter may either be induced for [[ions]] on [[crystal lattice]] sites with asymmetric charge surroundings (as in [[BaTiO3|BaTiO<sub>3</sub>]] and [[PZT]]s) or may directly be carried by molecular groups (as in [[cane sugar]]). The dipole density or [[Polarization density|polarization]] (dimensionality [C\u00b7m/m<sup>3</sup>] ) may easily be calculated for [[crystals]] by summing up the dipole moments per volume of the crystallographic [[unit cell]].<ref name=ZPB1995a>{{cite journal|author = M.

Dipoles near each other tend to be aligned in regions called Weiss domains. The domains are usually randomly oriented, but can be aligned using the process of ''poling'' (not the same as [[magnet#Magnetizing ferromagnets|magnetic poling]]), a process by which a strong electric field is applied across the material, usually at elevated temperatures. Not all piezoelectric materials can be poled.<ref name=\"PAMTA\">{{Cite book|author = S. Trolier-McKinstry|editor1=A. Safari |editor2=E.K.

This might either be caused by a reconfiguration of the dipole-inducing surrounding or by re-orientation of molecular dipole moments under the influence of the external stress. Piezoelectricity may then manifest in a variation of the polarization strength, its direction or both, with the details depending on: 1. the orientation of '''''P''''' within the crystal; 2. [[crystal symmetry]]; and 3. the applied mechanical stress. The change in '''''P''''' appears as a variation of surface [[charge density]] upon the crystal faces, i.e. as a variation of the [[electric field]] extending between the faces caused by a change in dipole density in the bulk. For example, a 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> cube of quartz with 2&nbsp;kN (500&nbsp;lbf) of correctly applied force can produce a voltage of 12500 [[Volt|V]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://machinedesign.com/article/sensor-sense-piezoelectric-force-sensors-0207 |title=Sensor Sense: Piezoelectric Force Sensors |author=Robert Repas |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413205918/http://machinedesign.com/article/sensor-sense-piezoelectric-force-sensors-0207 |archive-date=2010-04-13 |website=Machinedesign.com |date=2008-02-07 |access-date=2012-05-04}}</ref>\n\nPiezoelectric materials also show the opposite effect, called the '''converse piezoelectric effect''', where the application of an electrical field creates mechanical deformation in the crystal.\n\n===Mathematical description===\nLinear piezoelectricity is the combined effect of\n* The linear electrical behavior of the material:\n: <math>\\mathbf{D} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\,\\mathbf{E} \\quad \\implies \\quad D_i = \\varepsilon_{ij}\\,E_j \\;</math>\n: where ''D'' is the electric flux density<ref>IEC 80000-6, item 6-12</ref><ref>http://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/display?openform&ievref=121-11-40</ref> ([[electric displacement]]), ''\u03b5'' is [[permittivity]] (free-body dielectric constant), ''E'' is [[electric field strength]], and <math> \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{D} = 0 \\,\\,,\\, \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = \\mathbf{0} </math>.\n* [[Hooke's Law]] for linear elastic materials:\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{S}=\\mathsf{s}\\,\\boldsymbol{T} \\quad \\implies \\quad S_{ij} = s_{ijkl}\\,T_{kl}\\;</math>\n: where ''S'' is the linearized [[Strain (materials science)|strain]], ''s'' is [[Compliance (mechanics)|compliance]] under short-circuit conditions, ''T'' is [[Stress (physics)|stress]], and\n:<math> \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{T} = \\mathbf{0} \\,\\,,\\, \\boldsymbol{S} = \\frac{\\nabla \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{u} \\nabla}{2} </math>.\n\nThese may be combined into so-called ''[[coupled equation]]s'', of which the '''strain-charge form''' is:<ref name=ikeda>{{cite book|title=Fundamentals of piezoelectricity|last=Ikeda|first=T.|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press}}{{ISBN missing}}</ref>\n:<math>\n \\begin{align}\n \\boldsymbol{S} &= \\mathsf{s}\\,\\boldsymbol{T} + \\mathfrak{d}^t\\,\\mathbf{E} \\quad \\implies \\quad\n S_{ij} = s_{ijkl}\\,T_{kl} + d_{kij}\\,E_k \\\\\n \\mathbf{D} &= \\mathfrak{d}\\,\\boldsymbol{T} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\,\\mathbf{E} \\quad \\implies \\quad\n D_i = d_{ijk}\\,T_{jk} + \\varepsilon_{ij}\\,E_j \\,.\n \\end{align}\n</math>\nIn matrix form,\n:<math>\n \\begin{align}\n \\{S\\} &= \\left [s^E \\right ]\\{T\\}+[d^\\mathrm{t}]\\{E\\} \\\\\n \\{D\\} &= [d]\\{T\\}+\\left [ \\varepsilon^T \\right ] \\{E\\} \\,,\n \\end{align}\n</math>\nwhere [''d''] is the matrix for the direct piezoelectric effect and [''d''{{i sup|t}}] is the matrix for the converse piezoelectric effect.

Generally, ''D'' and ''E'' are [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]], that is, [[Cartesian tensor]]s of rank 1; and permittivity ''\u03b5'' is a Cartesian tensor of rank 2. Strain and stress are, in principle, also rank-2 [[tensors]]. But conventionally, because strain and stress are all symmetric tensors, the subscript of strain and stress can be relabeled in the following fashion: 11&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;1; 22&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;2; 33&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;3; 23&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;4; 13&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;5; 12&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;6.

A piezo-response observed by bulk polymers is mostly due to its molecular structure. There are two types of bulk polymers: [[Amorphous solid|amorphous]] and [[Semi-crystalline polymer|semi-crystalline]]. Examples of semi-crystalline polymers are [[Polyvinylidene fluoride|Polyvinylidene Fluoride]] (PVDF) and its [[copolymer]]s, [[Polyamide]]s, and [[Parylene|Parylene-C]]. Non-crystalline polymers, such as [[Polyimide]] and [[Polyvinylidene chloride|Polyvinylidene Chloride]] (PVDC), fall under amorphous bulk polymers. Voided charged polymers exhibit the piezoelectric effect due to charge induced by poling of a porous polymeric film. Under an electric field, charges form on the surface of the voids forming dipoles. Electric responses can be caused by any deformation of these voids. The piezoelectric effect can also be observed in polymer composites by integrating piezoelectric ceramic particles into a polymer film. A polymer does not have to be piezo-active to be an effective material for a polymer composite.<ref name=\":1\" /> In this case, a material could be made up of an inert matrix with a separate piezo-active component.\n\nPVDF exhibits piezoelectricity several times greater than quartz.

Unlike a conventional transformer, which uses magnetic coupling between input and output, the piezoelectric transformer uses [[acoustic coupling]]. An input voltage is applied across a short length of a bar of piezoceramic material such as [[Lead zirconate titanate|PZT]], creating an alternating stress in the bar by the inverse piezoelectric effect and causing the whole bar to vibrate. The vibration frequency is chosen to be the [[resonance|resonant]] frequency of the block, typically in the 100&nbsp;[[kilohertz]] to 1&nbsp;megahertz range. A higher output voltage is then generated across another section of the bar by the piezoelectric effect. Step-up ratios of more than 1,000:1 have been demonstrated.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} An extra feature of this transformer is that, by operating it above its resonant frequency, it can be made to appear as an [[inductor|inductive]] load, which is useful in circuits that require a controlled soft start.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4197064/Piezoelectric-Technology-A-Primer | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101006002651/http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4197064/Piezoelectric-Technology-A-Primer | archivedate = 2010-10-06 | title = Piezoelectric Technology: A Primer | last = Phillips | first = James R. | date = 2000-08-10 | website = eeProductCenter | publisher = TechInsights }}</ref> These devices can be used in DC\u2013AC inverters to drive [[cold cathode fluorescent lamp]]s.

Depending on the design of a sensor, different \"modes\" to load the piezoelectric element can be used: longitudinal, transversal and shear.\n\nDetection of pressure variations in the form of sound is the most common sensor application, e.g. piezoelectric [[microphone]]s (sound waves bend the piezoelectric material, creating a changing voltage) and piezoelectric [[Pick up (music technology)|pickups]] for [[acoustic-electric guitar]]s. A piezo sensor attached to the body of an instrument is known as a [[contact microphone]].\n\nPiezoelectric sensors especially are used with high frequency sound in ultrasonic transducers for medical imaging and also industrial [[nondestructive testing]] (NDT).\n\nFor many sensing techniques, the sensor can act as both a sensor and an actuator\u2014often the term ''transducer'' is preferred when the device acts in this dual capacity, but most piezo devices have this property of reversibility whether it is used or not. Ultrasonic transducers, for example, can inject ultrasound waves into the body, receive the returned wave, and convert it to an electrical signal (a voltage). Most medical ultrasound transducers are piezoelectric.\n\nIn addition to those mentioned above, various sensor applications include:\n* Piezoelectric elements are also used in the detection and generation of sonar waves.\n* Piezoelectric materials are used in single-axis and dual-axis tilt sensing.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Moubarak | first1 = P. | display-authors = etal | year = 2012 | title = A Self-Calibrating Mathematical Model for the Direct Piezoelectric Effect of a New MEMS Tilt Sensor | url = | journal = IEEE Sensors Journal | volume = 12 | issue = 5| pages = 1033\u20131042 | doi=10.1109/jsen.2011.2173188| bibcode = 2012ISenJ..12.1033M}}</ref>\n* Power monitoring in high power applications (e.g. medical treatment, [[sonochemistry]] and industrial processing).\n* [[Piezoelectric microbalance]]s are used as very sensitive chemical and biological sensors.\n* Piezos are sometimes used in [[strain gauge]]s.\n* A piezoelectric transducer was used in the penetrometer instrument on the [[Huygens Probe]].\n* Piezoelectric [[transducers]] are used in [[electronic drum|electronic drum pads]] to detect the impact of the drummer's sticks, and to detect muscle movements in medical [[acceleromyography]].\n* Automotive [[Engine Control Unit|engine management systems]] use piezoelectric transducers to detect Engine knock (Knock Sensor, KS), also known as detonation, at certain hertz frequencies. A piezoelectric transducer is also used in fuel injection systems to measure manifold absolute pressure (MAP sensor) to determine engine load, and ultimately the fuel injectors milliseconds of on time.\n* Ultrasonic piezo sensors are used in the detection of acoustic emissions in [[acoustic emission testing]].\n\n===Actuators===\n\n[[File:2007-07-24 Piezoelectric buzzer.jpg|thumb|Metal disk with piezoelectric disk attached, used in a [[buzzer]]]]\n\nAs very high electric fields correspond to only tiny changes in the width of the crystal, this width can be changed with better-than-[[micrometre|\u00b5m]] precision, making piezo crystals the most important tool for positioning objects with extreme accuracy\u2014thus their use in [[actuators]].<ref name=shabestari>{{cite journal\n|last1=Shabestari |first1=N.

By precisely controlling the distance between mirrors, the laser electronics can accurately maintain optical conditions inside the laser cavity to optimize the beam output.\n* A related application is the [[acousto-optic modulator]], a device that scatters light off soundwaves in a crystal, generated by piezoelectric elements.

The quartz crystal (like any [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] material) has a precisely defined natural frequency (caused by its shape and size) at which it prefers to [[oscillator|oscillate]], and this is used to stabilize the frequency of a periodic voltage applied to the crystal.\n* The same principle is used in some [[radio]] [[transmitter]]s and [[receiver (radio)|receivers]], and in [[computer]]s where it creates a [[clock pulse]]. Both of these usually use a [[frequency multiplier]] to reach gigahertz ranges.\n\n===Piezoelectric motors===\n[[File:Slip-stick actuator operation.svg|thumb|A slip-stick actuator]]\n{{Main|Piezoelectric motor}}\nTypes of piezoelectric motor include:\n* The [[traveling-wave motor]] used for [[auto-focus]] in [[single lens reflex|reflex cameras]]\n* [[Inchworm motor]]s for linear motion\n* Rectangular four-quadrant motors with high power density (2.5&nbsp;[[watt|W]]/cm<sup>3</sup>) and speed ranging from 10&nbsp;nm/s to 800&nbsp;mm/s.\n* Stepping piezo motor, using [[stick-slip]] effect.\n\nAside from the stepping stick-slip motor, all these motors work on the same principle. Driven by dual orthogonal vibration modes with a [[phase (waves)|phase]] difference of 90\u00b0, the contact point between two surfaces vibrates in an [[ellipse|elliptical]] path, producing a [[friction]]al force between the surfaces. Usually, one surface is fixed, causing the other to move. In most piezoelectric motors, the piezoelectric crystal is excited by a [[sine wave]] signal at the resonant frequency of the motor. Using the resonance effect, a much lower voltage can be used to produce a high vibration amplitude.\n\nA stick-slip motor works using the inertia of a mass and the friction of a clamp. Such motors can be very small. Some are used for camera sensor displacement, thus allowing an anti-shake function.\n\n===Reduction of vibrations and noise===\n\nDifferent teams of researchers have been investigating ways to reduce vibrations in materials by attaching piezo elements to the material. When the material is bent by a vibration in one direction, the vibration-reduction system responds to the bend and sends electric power to the piezo element to bend in the other direction. Future applications of this technology are expected in cars and houses to reduce noise. Further applications to flexible structures, such as shells and plates, have also been studied for nearly three decades.\n\nIn a demonstration at the Material Vision Fair in [[Frankfurt]] in November 2005, a team from [[Darmstadt University of Technology|TU Darmstadt]] in [[Germany]] showed several panels that were hit with a rubber mallet, and the panel with the piezo element immediately stopped swinging.\n\nPiezoelectric ceramic fiber technology is being used as an electronic damping system on some [[Head (company)|HEAD]] [[tennis racket]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.head.com/tennis/technology.php?region=eu&tag=intelligence |title=Isn't it amazing how one smart idea, one chip and an intelligent material has changed the world of tennis? |accessdate=2008-02-27 |publisher=Head.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222224436/http://www.head.com/tennis/technology.php?region=eu&tag=intelligence |archivedate=February 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Infertility treatment===\nIn people with previous [[total fertilization failure]], piezoelectric activation of oocytes together with [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI) seems to improve fertilization outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The effectiveness of intracytoplasmic sperm injection combined with piezoelectric stimulation in infertile couples with total fertilization failure |journal=Fertil.

Sound levels as low as 75 decibels improved efficiency by up to 50%. Efficiency peaked at 10&nbsp;kHz, the resonant frequency of the nanotubes. The electrical field set up by the vibrating nanotubes interacts with electrons migrating from the organic polymer layer.

More work was done to explore and define the crystal structures that exhibited piezoelectricity. This culminated in 1910 with the publication of [[Woldemar Voigt]]'s ''Lehrbuch der Kristallphysik'' (''Textbook on Crystal Physics''),<ref>{{cite book |first=Woldemar |last=Voigt |author-link=Woldemar Voigt |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SvPPAAAAMAAJ&pg=PR1#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Lehrbuch der Kristallphysik |location=Berlin |publisher=B.

In [[France]] in 1917, [[Paul Langevin]] and his coworkers developed an [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] [[submarine]] detector.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Who knew piezoelectricity? Rutherford and Langevin on submarine detection and the invention of sonar |last= Katzir |first= S. |journal= Notes Rec. R. Soc. |date= 2012 |volume= 66 |issue= 2 |pages= 141\u2013157 |doi= 10.1098/rsnr.2011.0049 }}</ref> The detector consisted of a [[transducer]], made of thin quartz crystals carefully glued between two steel plates, and a [[hydrophone]] to detect the returned [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]]. By emitting a high-frequency pulse from the transducer, and measuring the amount of time it takes to hear an echo from the sound waves bouncing off an object, one can calculate the distance to that object.\n\nThe use of piezoelectricity in sonar, and the success of that project, created intense development interest in piezoelectric devices. Over the next few decades, new piezoelectric materials and new applications for those materials were explored and developed.\n\nPiezoelectric devices found homes in many fields. Ceramic [[phonograph]] cartridges simplified player design, were cheap and accurate, and made record players cheaper to maintain and easier to build. The development of the ultrasonic transducer allowed for easy measurement of viscosity and elasticity in fluids and solids, resulting in huge advances in materials research. Ultrasonic [[time-domain reflectometer]]s (which send an ultrasonic pulse through a material and measure reflections from discontinuities) could find flaws inside cast metal and stone objects, improving structural safety.\n\n===World War II and post-war===\nDuring [[World War II]], independent research groups in the [[United States]], [[Russia]], and [[Japan]] discovered a new class of synthetic materials, called [[ferroelectricity|ferroelectrics]], which exhibited piezoelectric constants many times higher than natural materials. This led to intense research to develop [[barium titanate]] and later lead zirconate titanate materials with specific properties for particular applications.\n\nOne significant example of the use of piezoelectric crystals was developed by Bell Telephone Laboratories. Following World War I, Frederick R. Lack, working in radio telephony in the engineering department, developed the \"AT cut\" crystal, a crystal that operated through a wide range of temperatures. Lack's crystal did not need the heavy accessories previous crystal used, facilitating its use on aircraft. This development allowed Allied air forces to engage in coordinated mass attacks through the use of aviation radio.\n\nDevelopment of piezoelectric devices and materials in the United States was kept within the companies doing the development, mostly due to the wartime beginnings of the field, and in the interests of securing profitable patents. New materials were the first to be developed\u2014quartz crystals were the first commercially exploited piezoelectric material, but scientists searched for higher-performance materials. Despite the advances in materials and the maturation of manufacturing processes, the United States market did not grow as quickly as Japan's did. Without many new applications, the growth of the United States' piezoelectric industry suffered.\n\nIn contrast, Japanese manufacturers shared their information, quickly overcoming technical and manufacturing challenges and creating new markets. In Japan, a temperature stable crystal cut was developed by [[Issac Koga]]. Japanese efforts in materials research created piezoceramic materials competitive to the United States materials but free of expensive patent restrictions. Major Japanese piezoelectric developments included new designs of piezoceramic filters for radios and televisions, piezo buzzers and audio transducers that can connect directly to electronic circuits, and the [[piezo ignition|piezoelectric igniter]], which generates sparks for small engine ignition systems and gas-grill lighters, by compressing a ceramic disc. Ultrasonic transducers that transmit sound waves through air had existed for quite some time but first saw major commercial use in early television remote controls. These transducers now are mounted on several [[automobile|car]] models as an [[Acoustic location|echolocation]] device, helping the driver determine the distance from the car to any objects that may be in its path.\n\n==Mechanism==\n[[File:Piezo bending principle.jpg|thumb|Piezoelectric plate used to convert [[audio signal]] to sound waves]]\nThe nature of the piezoelectric effect is closely related to the occurrence of [[electric dipole moment]]s in solids. The latter may either be induced for [[ions]] on [[crystal lattice]] sites with asymmetric charge surroundings (as in [[BaTiO3|BaTiO<sub>3</sub>]] and [[PZT]]s) or may directly be carried by molecular groups (as in [[cane sugar]]). The dipole density or [[Polarization density|polarization]] (dimensionality [C\u00b7m/m<sup>3</sup>] ) may easily be calculated for [[crystals]] by summing up the dipole moments per volume of the crystallographic [[unit cell]].<ref name=ZPB1995a>{{cite journal|author = M.

Dipoles near each other tend to be aligned in regions called Weiss domains. The domains are usually randomly oriented, but can be aligned using the process of ''poling'' (not the same as [[magnet#Magnetizing ferromagnets|magnetic poling]]), a process by which a strong electric field is applied across the material, usually at elevated temperatures. Not all piezoelectric materials can be poled.<ref name=\"PAMTA\">{{Cite book|author = S. Trolier-McKinstry|editor1=A. Safari |editor2=E.K.

This might either be caused by a reconfiguration of the dipole-inducing surrounding or by re-orientation of molecular dipole moments under the influence of the external stress. Piezoelectricity may then manifest in a variation of the polarization strength, its direction or both, with the details depending on: 1. the orientation of '''''P''''' within the crystal; 2. [[crystal symmetry]]; and 3. the applied mechanical stress. The change in '''''P''''' appears as a variation of surface [[charge density]] upon the crystal faces, i.e. as a variation of the [[electric field]] extending between the faces caused by a change in dipole density in the bulk.

Generally, ''D'' and ''E'' are [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]], that is, [[Cartesian tensor]]s of rank 1; and permittivity ''\u03b5'' is a Cartesian tensor of rank 2. Strain and stress are, in principle, also rank-2 [[tensors]]. But conventionally, because strain and stress are all symmetric tensors, the subscript of strain and stress can be relabeled in the following fashion: 11&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;1; 22&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;2; 33&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;3; 23&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;4; 13&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;5; 12&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;6. (Different conventions may be used by different authors in literature. For example, some use 12&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;4; 23&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;5; 31&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;6 instead.) That is why ''S'' and ''T'' appear to have the \"vector form\" of six components. Consequently, ''s'' appears to be a 6-by-6 matrix instead of a rank-3 tensor. Such a relabeled notation is often called [[Voigt notation]]. Whether the shear strain components ''S''<sub>4</sub>, ''S''<sub>5</sub>, ''S''<sub>6</sub> are tensor components or engineering strains is another question. In the equation above, they must be engineering strains for the 6,6 coefficient of the compliance matrix to be written as shown, i.e., 2(''s''{{su|b=11|p=''E''}}&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''s''{{su|b=12|p=''E''}}). Engineering shear strains are double the value of the corresponding tensor shear, such as ''S''<sub>6</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2''S''<sub>12</sub> and so on.

Voided charged polymers exhibit the piezoelectric effect due to charge induced by poling of a porous polymeric film. Under an electric field, charges form on the surface of the voids forming dipoles. Electric responses can be caused by any deformation of these voids. The piezoelectric effect can also be observed in polymer composites by integrating piezoelectric ceramic particles into a polymer film. A polymer does not have to be piezo-active to be an effective material for a polymer composite.<ref name=\":1\" /> In this case, a material could be made up of an inert matrix with a separate piezo-active component.\n\nPVDF exhibits piezoelectricity several times greater than quartz. The piezo-response observed from PVDF is about 20\u201330 pC/N. That is an order of 5\u201350 times less than that of piezoelectric ceramic lead zirconate titanate (PZT).<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> The thermal stability of the piezoelectric effect of polymers in the PVDF family (i.e. vinylidene fluoride co-poly trifluoroethylene) goes up to 125&nbsp;\u00b0C.

However, these energy harvesting sources by association affect the body. DARPA's effort to harness 1\u20132&nbsp;watts from continuous shoe impact while walking were abandoned due to the impracticality and the discomfort from the additional energy expended by a person wearing the shoes.

Unlike a conventional transformer, which uses magnetic coupling between input and output, the piezoelectric transformer uses [[acoustic coupling]]. An input voltage is applied across a short length of a bar of piezoceramic material such as [[Lead zirconate titanate|PZT]], creating an alternating stress in the bar by the inverse piezoelectric effect and causing the whole bar to vibrate. The vibration frequency is chosen to be the [[resonance|resonant]] frequency of the block, typically in the 100&nbsp;[[kilohertz]] to 1&nbsp;megahertz range. A higher output voltage is then generated across another section of the bar by the piezoelectric effect.

Depending on the design of a sensor, different \"modes\" to load the piezoelectric element can be used: longitudinal, transversal and shear.\n\nDetection of pressure variations in the form of sound is the most common sensor application, e.g. piezoelectric [[microphone]]s (sound waves bend the piezoelectric material, creating a changing voltage) and piezoelectric [[Pick up (music technology)|pickups]] for [[acoustic-electric guitar]]s. A piezo sensor attached to the body of an instrument is known as a [[contact microphone]].\n\nPiezoelectric sensors especially are used with high frequency sound in ultrasonic transducers for medical imaging and also industrial [[nondestructive testing]] (NDT).\n\nFor many sensing techniques, the sensor can act as both a sensor and an actuator\u2014often the term ''transducer'' is preferred when the device acts in this dual capacity, but most piezo devices have this property of reversibility whether it is used or not. Ultrasonic transducers, for example, can inject ultrasound waves into the body, receive the returned wave, and convert it to an electrical signal (a voltage). Most medical ultrasound transducers are piezoelectric.\n\nIn addition to those mentioned above, various sensor applications include:\n* Piezoelectric elements are also used in the detection and generation of sonar waves.\n* Piezoelectric materials are used in single-axis and dual-axis tilt sensing.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Moubarak | first1 = P. | display-authors = etal | year = 2012 | title = A Self-Calibrating Mathematical Model for the Direct Piezoelectric Effect of a New MEMS Tilt Sensor | url = | journal = IEEE Sensors Journal | volume = 12 | issue = 5| pages = 1033\u20131042 | doi=10.1109/jsen.2011.2173188| bibcode = 2012ISenJ..12.1033M}}</ref>\n* Power monitoring in high power applications (e.g. medical treatment, [[sonochemistry]] and industrial processing).\n* [[Piezoelectric microbalance]]s are used as very sensitive chemical and biological sensors.\n* Piezos are sometimes used in [[strain gauge]]s.\n* A piezoelectric transducer was used in the penetrometer instrument on the [[Huygens Probe]].\n* Piezoelectric [[transducers]] are used in [[electronic drum|electronic drum pads]] to detect the impact of the drummer's sticks, and to detect muscle movements in medical [[acceleromyography]].\n* Automotive [[Engine Control Unit|engine management systems]] use piezoelectric transducers to detect Engine knock (Knock Sensor, KS), also known as detonation, at certain hertz frequencies.

The quartz crystal (like any [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] material) has a precisely defined natural frequency (caused by its shape and size) at which it prefers to [[oscillator|oscillate]], and this is used to stabilize the frequency of a periodic voltage applied to the crystal.\n* The same principle is used in some [[radio]] [[transmitter]]s and [[receiver (radio)|receivers]], and in [[computer]]s where it creates a [[clock pulse]]. Both of these usually use a [[frequency multiplier]] to reach gigahertz ranges.\n\n===Piezoelectric motors===\n[[File:Slip-stick actuator operation.svg|thumb|A slip-stick actuator]]\n{{Main|Piezoelectric motor}}\nTypes of piezoelectric motor include:\n* The [[traveling-wave motor]] used for [[auto-focus]] in [[single lens reflex|reflex cameras]]\n* [[Inchworm motor]]s for linear motion\n* Rectangular four-quadrant motors with high power density (2.5&nbsp;[[watt|W]]/cm<sup>3</sup>) and speed ranging from 10&nbsp;nm/s to 800&nbsp;mm/s.\n* Stepping piezo motor, using [[stick-slip]] effect.\n\nAside from the stepping stick-slip motor, all these motors work on the same principle. Driven by dual orthogonal vibration modes with a [[phase (waves)|phase]] difference of 90\u00b0, the contact point between two surfaces vibrates in an [[ellipse|elliptical]] path, producing a [[friction]]al force between the surfaces. Usually, one surface is fixed, causing the other to move. In most piezoelectric motors, the piezoelectric crystal is excited by a [[sine wave]] signal at the resonant frequency of the motor. Using the resonance effect, a much lower voltage can be used to produce a high vibration amplitude.\n\nA stick-slip motor works using the inertia of a mass and the friction of a clamp. Such motors can be very small. Some are used for camera sensor displacement, thus allowing an anti-shake function.\n\n===Reduction of vibrations and noise===\n\nDifferent teams of researchers have been investigating ways to reduce vibrations in materials by attaching piezo elements to the material. When the material is bent by a vibration in one direction, the vibration-reduction system responds to the bend and sends electric power to the piezo element to bend in the other direction. Future applications of this technology are expected in cars and houses to reduce noise. Further applications to flexible structures, such as shells and plates, have also been studied for nearly three decades.\n\nIn a demonstration at the Material Vision Fair in [[Frankfurt]] in November 2005, a team from [[Darmstadt University of Technology|TU Darmstadt]] in [[Germany]] showed several panels that were hit with a rubber mallet, and the panel with the piezo element immediately stopped swinging.\n\nPiezoelectric ceramic fiber technology is being used as an electronic damping system on some [[Head (company)|HEAD]] [[tennis racket]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.head.com/tennis/technology.php?region=eu&tag=intelligence |title=Isn't it amazing how one smart idea, one chip and an intelligent material has changed the world of tennis? |accessdate=2008-02-27 |publisher=Head.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222224436/http://www.head.com/tennis/technology.php?region=eu&tag=intelligence |archivedate=February 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Infertility treatment===\nIn people with previous [[total fertilization failure]], piezoelectric activation of oocytes together with [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI) seems to improve fertilization outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The effectiveness of intracytoplasmic sperm injection combined with piezoelectric stimulation in infertile couples with total fertilization failure |journal=Fertil.

The modelling results indicate that the total annual energy harvesting potential for the proposed optimized tile pavement model is estimated at 1.1&nbsp;MW&nbsp;h/year, which would be sufficient to meet close to 0.5% of the annual energy needs of the building.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In Israel, there is a company which has installed piezoelectric materials under a busy highway.

The effect was demonstrated with organic cells using [[zinc oxide]] nanotubes. The electricity generated by the piezoelectric effect itself is a negligible percentage of the overall output. Sound levels as low as 75 decibels improved efficiency by up to 50%. Efficiency peaked at 10&nbsp;kHz, the resonant frequency of the nanotubes. The electrical field set up by the vibrating nanotubes interacts with electrons migrating from the organic polymer layer. This process decreases the likelihood of recombination, in which electrons are energized but settle back into a hole instead of migrating to the electron-accepting ZnO layer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmag.com/vibration-sound-efficient-hybrid-solar-cell-arrays/29679/ |title=Good vibrations lead to efficient excitations in hybrid solar cells |publisher=Gizmag.com |accessdate=2013-11-11 |author=Heidi Hoopes |date=November 8, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111193548/http://www.gizmag.com/vibration-sound-efficient-hybrid-solar-cell-arrays/29679/ |archivedate=November 11, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Shoaee | first1 = S. | last2 = Briscoe | first2 = J. | last3 = Durrant | first3 = J.

''Quake'' was also intended to feature ''Virtua Fighter'' influenced third-person [[Beat 'em up|melee combat]].

The 3D environment in which the game takes place is referred to as a ''map'', even though it is three-dimensional in nature rather than a flat 2D space. The map editor program uses a number of simple convex 3D geometric objects known as ''[[Brush (video game)|brushes]]'' that are sized and rotated to build the environment. The brushes are placed and oriented to create an enclosed, empty, volumetric space, and when the design is complete, the map is run through the rendering preprocessor. The preprocessor is used to locate two types of empty space in the map: the empty space enclosed by brushes where the game will be played and the other empty space outside the brushes that the player will never see. The preprocessor then strips away the back faces of the individual brushes, which are outside the game space, leaving only a few polygons that define the outer perimeter of the enclosed game space.\n\nGenerally, once a map has been preprocessed, it cannot be re-edited in a normal fashion because the original brushes have been cut into small pieces. Instead, the original map editor data with the brushes is retained and used to create new versions of the map. But it is possible to edit a processed map by opening it in a special [[Vertex (computer graphics)|vertex]] editor and editing the raw vertex data, or to add or remove individual triangle faces. Though difficult, this technique was occasionally used by cheaters to create windows in walls, to see normally hidden enemies approaching from behind doors and walls, and resulted in an anti-cheat mechanism used in recent 3D games that calculates a [[checksum]] for each file used in the game, to detect players using potentially hacked map files.\n\nA processed map file can have a much lower polygon count than the original unprocessed map, often by 50\u201380%. On the 50\u201375&nbsp;MHz PCs of the time, it was common for this pruning step to take many hours to complete on a map, often running overnight if the map design was extremely complex.\n\nThis preprocessing step cannot work if there are any small holes or \"leaks\" that interconnect the interior game space with the exterior empty space, and it was common for complex map-building projects to be abandoned because the map designer could not locate the leaks in their map. To prevent leaks, the brushes should overlap and slightly interpenetrate each other; attempting to perfectly align along the edges of unusually shaped brushes on a grid can result in very small gaps that are difficult to locate.\n\nThe open sky in ''Quake'' maps is in fact not open, but is covered over and enclosed with large brushes, and textured with a special [[Skybox (video games)|skybox]] texture, which is programmed to use [[sphere mapping]], and thus always looks the same from any viewing position, giving the illusion of a distant sky.\n\n===Precalculating lighting and shadows===\n''Quake'' also incorporated the use of lightmaps and 3D light sources, as opposed to the sector-based static lighting used in games of the past. id Software's innovation has been used for many 3D games released since, particularly first-person shooters, though id Software switched to a [[Unified lighting and shadowing]] model for ''[[Doom 3]]'' (however, they switched back to a lightmapped or semi-lightmapped method starting with ''[[Rage (video game)|RAGE]]''). After a map had been pruned of excess polygons, a second preprocessing system was used to precalculate and ''bake'' the lightmaps into the game map to further reduce load on the CPU when playing the game. However, full light processing could take an extremely long time, so for the initial map design process, lesser-quality light processing could be done, but at the cost of creating a jagged stair-step lightcast around lights.\n\n===Sectioning the map to increase speed===\nTo further decrease the workload of 3D rendering, a mechanism was developed to section off large regions of the map not currently visible to the player, so the engine would not need to render those unseen spaces. A 3D rendering engine without any such optimizations must draw every part of the world and then attempt to determine which polygons are the closest, then hide all polygons located behind these closest polygons (a technique known as [[Z-buffering]]). Just because a polygon is not visible does not mean it is excluded from the scene calculations.\n\nThe ''Quake'' engine was optimized specifically to obviate this problem. The engine could be told ahead of time to not calculate rendering for all objects in any space out of the player's view, greatly reducing the rendering load on the CPU. This effect is noticeable in the game as small tunnels with sharp 90-degree bends leading from one large space into another. This small tunnel serves to block view into the adjoining unrendered space, and a special type of transparent brush (called a ''visportal'') is placed within it to define the edge of where the engine should stop rendering the adjoining space. It is uncommon in the original ''Quake'' to be able to see across the entire length of a map, and outdoor spaces are often very tall and narrow, primarily utilizing distance above into open sky or below into lava to create a low-polygonal illusion of expanse.\n\n====How sectioning is performed====\nA [[binary space partitioning]] (BSP) tree is built from the map, simplifying complexity of searching for a given polygon to [[Big-O notation|O]](number of polygons). Each leaf creates some area of 3D space (imagine cutting a pie into arbitrary pieces). The leaves of this [[binary tree]] have polygons of the original map associated with them, which are then used for computing each area's visibility. For each area, the [[Hidden-surface determination|VSD]] algorithm finds the parts of the map for which a line of sight exists. This is called the [[potentially visible set]] (PVS).<ref name=Engine>{{cite web |last=Abrash |first=Michael |title=Quake's 3-D Engine: The Big Picture |url=http://www.bluesnews.com/abrash/ |accessdate=22 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nThis process uses large amounts of memory, since it should take <math>O(n^2)</math> (where <math>n</math> is the number of polygons) bits (only visible/hidden information is needed). [[John D. Carmack|John Carmack]] realized that one area sees just a small fraction of the other areas, so he compressed this information by using [[run-length encoding]] (RLE). This is what allowed ''Quake''{{'}}s complex geometry to be rendered so quickly on the hardware of the time.\n\n===Speeding up the rendering, and rendering order===\nTo reduce overdraw (rendering a new pixel that hides a previously rendered point, meaning the previous work was useless and wasted), the environment was displayed first, from front to back. To hide parts of walls hidden by other walls, a Global Edge List was sorting edges of already rendered polygons; new polygons were first clipped against previous edges so that only visible parts would get to the frame buffer.\n\nAlso while rendering the environment, a ZBuffer was filled but never read while rendering the environment, as the BSP tree and Global Edge List ensured that each pixel was rendered only once. The ZBuffer was later used to render correctly characters and other moving objects that were partially hidden by the environment.\n\nThe pixel rendering loop was implemented in assembly. The texture coordinates [[Texture mapping#Perspective correctness|perspective correction]] and [[Image scaling|interpolation]] was done using the [[floating-point unit]], due to the limited number of integer registers; it also allows to compute expensive division operation (part of perspective correction) on the floating-point unit in parallel with integer interpolation (in other words, at no cost).\n\nThe base texture and the lightmap of a wall were rendered at the same time: a \"surface cache\" was creating new surfaces, which are new pre-lighted textures which combines the base and light map textures [[Baking (computer graphics)|baked]] together. Surfaces not used since a few frames were released, while new required Surfaces were dynamically created. Generating the surfaces was consuming less time than a secondary lighting pass would have.\nTo save memory, smaller surfaces using [[mipmap]]s of the original texture were generated first for further walls.\n\nThe characters were lit using a constant ambient light, which value came from a structure storing ambient colors in 3D, depending on the character's position.\nCharacters and objects very far from the camera were not rendered in 3D: they were instead rendered as [[voxel]]s: 3D big square points of a single color (which came from the object texture).\n\n===Hardware 3D acceleration===\n''Quake'' was one of the first games to support 3D [[hardware acceleration]]. While initially released with only [[software rendering]], John Carmack created a version of the ''Quake'' executable that took advantage of [[Rendition (company)|Rendition]]'s V\u00e9rit\u00e9 1000 graphics chip ([[VQuake]]). [[OpenGL]] support was added in the form of the ''[[GLQuake]]'' executable for Windows 95 and higher. Other cards capable of rendering ''GLQuake'' were a professional (and very expensive) [[Intergraph]] 3D OpenGL card and later, the [[PowerVR]] cards.\n\nTo optimize the software rendering engine, lightmaps were shared by polygons that were close in space, and in the same leaf of the BSP tree. This means that quite often polygons using the same main texture could not be rendered at the same time with the 3D acceleration, due to the multi-texturing second unit having to be reconfigured with another lightmap. This architecture decision reduced hardware-accelerated rendering performance.\n\n===Network play===\n''Quake'' includes [[cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] and [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] multiplayer modes over [[local area network|LAN]] or the [[Internet]]. Additional multiplayer modes were later added using [[Mod (computer gaming)|mods]].\n\n''Quake'' uses the [[client\u2013server model]], where a [[game server|server]] has control of all game events. All players connect to this server in order to participate, with the server telling the clients what is happening in the game. The server may either be a [[dedicated server]] or a [[Listen Server]]. Even in the latter situation, ''Quake'' still uses the client-server model, as opposed to the [[peer-to-peer]] networking used by some other games. ''Quake'' thus cannot suffer from de-synchronized network games that could occur from different clients disagreeing with each other, since the server is always the final authority.\n\n==Derivative engines==\n[[Image:Quake - family tree.svg|thumb|[[Family tree]] illustrating derivations of Quake engines (this graph was last updated in 2013)|alt=]]\n\nOn December 21, 1999, John Carmack of id Software released the ''Quake'' engine [[source code]] on the Internet under the terms of the GPL, allowing programmers to edit the engine and add new features.

The ''Quake'' engine also used [[Gouraud shading]] for moving objects, and a static [[lightmap]] for nonmoving objects.\n\nHistorically, the ''Quake'' engine has been treated as a separate engine from its successor, the ''Quake II'' engine. However, both engines are now considered variants of [[id Tech 2]]. Although, the codebases for ''Quake'' and ''Quake II'' were separate GPL releases.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quake engine GPL release|url=ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/source/q1source.zip|accessdate=11 November 2015}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=id Tech 2 GPL release |url=ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/source/q2source-3.21.zip |accessdate=11 November 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See|Quake (video game)#Development}}\n\nThe ''Quake'' engine was developed from 1995 for the video game ''Quake'', released on June 22, 1996. [[John D. Carmack|John Carmack]] did most of the programming of the engine, with help from [[Michael Abrash]] in [[algorithm]]s and [[Assembly language|assembly]] [[optimization (computer science)|optimization]]. The [[Quake II engine]] (id Tech 2) was based on it.\n\n[[John Romero]] initially conceived of ''Quake'' as an [[action game]] taking place in a fully [[3D computer graphics|3D polygon]] world, inspired by [[Sega AM2]]'s 3D [[fighting game]] ''[[Virtua Fighter]]''. ''Quake'' was also intended to feature ''Virtua Fighter'' influenced third-person [[Beat 'em up|melee combat]]. However, id Software considered it to be risky, and it would've taken longer to develop the engine. Because the project was taking too long, the third-person melee was eventually dropped.<ref name=\"nextgen\">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=30|date=June 1997|pages=9\u201312|title=Does John Romero Still Enjoy Shooting People?|url=https://archive.org/stream/NextGeneration30Jun1997/Next_Generation_30_Jun_1997#page/n9/mode/2up}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|issue=45|date=May 1997|quote=My original idea was to do something like ''Virtua Fighter'' in a 3D world, with full-contact fighting, but you'd also be able to run through a world, and do the same stuff you do in ''Quake'', only when you got into these melees, the camera would pull out into a third-person perspective.

The 3D environment in which the game takes place is referred to as a ''map'', even though it is three-dimensional in nature rather than a flat 2D space. The map editor program uses a number of simple convex 3D geometric objects known as ''[[Brush (video game)|brushes]]'' that are sized and rotated to build the environment. The brushes are placed and oriented to create an enclosed, empty, volumetric space, and when the design is complete, the map is run through the rendering preprocessor. The preprocessor is used to locate two types of empty space in the map: the empty space enclosed by brushes where the game will be played and the other empty space outside the brushes that the player will never see. The preprocessor then strips away the back faces of the individual brushes, which are outside the game space, leaving only a few polygons that define the outer perimeter of the enclosed game space.\n\nGenerally, once a map has been preprocessed, it cannot be re-edited in a normal fashion because the original brushes have been cut into small pieces. Instead, the original map editor data with the brushes is retained and used to create new versions of the map. But it is possible to edit a processed map by opening it in a special [[Vertex (computer graphics)|vertex]] editor and editing the raw vertex data, or to add or remove individual triangle faces. Though difficult, this technique was occasionally used by cheaters to create windows in walls, to see normally hidden enemies approaching from behind doors and walls, and resulted in an anti-cheat mechanism used in recent 3D games that calculates a [[checksum]] for each file used in the game, to detect players using potentially hacked map files.\n\nA processed map file can have a much lower polygon count than the original unprocessed map, often by 50\u201380%. On the 50\u201375&nbsp;MHz PCs of the time, it was common for this pruning step to take many hours to complete on a map, often running overnight if the map design was extremely complex.\n\nThis preprocessing step cannot work if there are any small holes or \"leaks\" that interconnect the interior game space with the exterior empty space, and it was common for complex map-building projects to be abandoned because the map designer could not locate the leaks in their map. To prevent leaks, the brushes should overlap and slightly interpenetrate each other; attempting to perfectly align along the edges of unusually shaped brushes on a grid can result in very small gaps that are difficult to locate.\n\nThe open sky in ''Quake'' maps is in fact not open, but is covered over and enclosed with large brushes, and textured with a special [[Skybox (video games)|skybox]] texture, which is programmed to use [[sphere mapping]], and thus always looks the same from any viewing position, giving the illusion of a distant sky.\n\n===Precalculating lighting and shadows===\n''Quake'' also incorporated the use of lightmaps and 3D light sources, as opposed to the sector-based static lighting used in games of the past. id Software's innovation has been used for many 3D games released since, particularly first-person shooters, though id Software switched to a [[Unified lighting and shadowing]] model for ''[[Doom 3]]'' (however, they switched back to a lightmapped or semi-lightmapped method starting with ''[[Rage (video game)|RAGE]]''). After a map had been pruned of excess polygons, a second preprocessing system was used to precalculate and ''bake'' the lightmaps into the game map to further reduce load on the CPU when playing the game. However, full light processing could take an extremely long time, so for the initial map design process, lesser-quality light processing could be done, but at the cost of creating a jagged stair-step lightcast around lights.\n\n===Sectioning the map to increase speed===\nTo further decrease the workload of 3D rendering, a mechanism was developed to section off large regions of the map not currently visible to the player, so the engine would not need to render those unseen spaces. A 3D rendering engine without any such optimizations must draw every part of the world and then attempt to determine which polygons are the closest, then hide all polygons located behind these closest polygons (a technique known as [[Z-buffering]]). Just because a polygon is not visible does not mean it is excluded from the scene calculations.\n\nThe ''Quake'' engine was optimized specifically to obviate this problem. The engine could be told ahead of time to not calculate rendering for all objects in any space out of the player's view, greatly reducing the rendering load on the CPU. This effect is noticeable in the game as small tunnels with sharp 90-degree bends leading from one large space into another. This small tunnel serves to block view into the adjoining unrendered space, and a special type of transparent brush (called a ''visportal'') is placed within it to define the edge of where the engine should stop rendering the adjoining space. It is uncommon in the original ''Quake'' to be able to see across the entire length of a map, and outdoor spaces are often very tall and narrow, primarily utilizing distance above into open sky or below into lava to create a low-polygonal illusion of expanse.\n\n====How sectioning is performed====\nA [[binary space partitioning]] (BSP) tree is built from the map, simplifying complexity of searching for a given polygon to [[Big-O notation|O]](number of polygons). Each leaf creates some area of 3D space (imagine cutting a pie into arbitrary pieces). The leaves of this [[binary tree]] have polygons of the original map associated with them, which are then used for computing each area's visibility. For each area, the [[Hidden-surface determination|VSD]] algorithm finds the parts of the map for which a line of sight exists. This is called the [[potentially visible set]] (PVS).<ref name=Engine>{{cite web |last=Abrash |first=Michael |title=Quake's 3-D Engine: The Big Picture |url=http://www.bluesnews.com/abrash/ |accessdate=22 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nThis process uses large amounts of memory, since it should take <math>O(n^2)</math> (where <math>n</math> is the number of polygons) bits (only visible/hidden information is needed). [[John D. Carmack|John Carmack]] realized that one area sees just a small fraction of the other areas, so he compressed this information by using [[run-length encoding]] (RLE). This is what allowed ''Quake''{{'}}s complex geometry to be rendered so quickly on the hardware of the time.\n\n===Speeding up the rendering, and rendering order===\nTo reduce overdraw (rendering a new pixel that hides a previously rendered point, meaning the previous work was useless and wasted), the environment was displayed first, from front to back. To hide parts of walls hidden by other walls, a Global Edge List was sorting edges of already rendered polygons; new polygons were first clipped against previous edges so that only visible parts would get to the frame buffer.\n\nAlso while rendering the environment, a ZBuffer was filled but never read while rendering the environment, as the BSP tree and Global Edge List ensured that each pixel was rendered only once. The ZBuffer was later used to render correctly characters and other moving objects that were partially hidden by the environment.\n\nThe pixel rendering loop was implemented in assembly. The texture coordinates [[Texture mapping#Perspective correctness|perspective correction]] and [[Image scaling|interpolation]] was done using the [[floating-point unit]], due to the limited number of integer registers; it also allows to compute expensive division operation (part of perspective correction) on the floating-point unit in parallel with integer interpolation (in other words, at no cost).\n\nThe base texture and the lightmap of a wall were rendered at the same time: a \"surface cache\" was creating new surfaces, which are new pre-lighted textures which combines the base and light map textures [[Baking (computer graphics)|baked]] together. Surfaces not used since a few frames were released, while new required Surfaces were dynamically created. Generating the surfaces was consuming less time than a secondary lighting pass would have.\nTo save memory, smaller surfaces using [[mipmap]]s of the original texture were generated first for further walls.\n\nThe characters were lit using a constant ambient light, which value came from a structure storing ambient colors in 3D, depending on the character's position.\nCharacters and objects very far from the camera were not rendered in 3D: they were instead rendered as [[voxel]]s: 3D big square points of a single color (which came from the object texture).\n\n===Hardware 3D acceleration===\n''Quake'' was one of the first games to support 3D [[hardware acceleration]]. While initially released with only [[software rendering]], John Carmack created a version of the ''Quake'' executable that took advantage of [[Rendition (company)|Rendition]]'s V\u00e9rit\u00e9 1000 graphics chip ([[VQuake]]). [[OpenGL]] support was added in the form of the ''[[GLQuake]]'' executable for Windows 95 and higher. Other cards capable of rendering ''GLQuake'' were a professional (and very expensive) [[Intergraph]] 3D OpenGL card and later, the [[PowerVR]] cards.\n\nTo optimize the software rendering engine, lightmaps were shared by polygons that were close in space, and in the same leaf of the BSP tree. This means that quite often polygons using the same main texture could not be rendered at the same time with the 3D acceleration, due to the multi-texturing second unit having to be reconfigured with another lightmap. This architecture decision reduced hardware-accelerated rendering performance.\n\n===Network play===\n''Quake'' includes [[cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] and [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] multiplayer modes over [[local area network|LAN]] or the [[Internet]]. Additional multiplayer modes were later added using [[Mod (computer gaming)|mods]].\n\n''Quake'' uses the [[client\u2013server model]], where a [[game server|server]] has control of all game events. All players connect to this server in order to participate, with the server telling the clients what is happening in the game. The server may either be a [[dedicated server]] or a [[Listen Server]]. Even in the latter situation, ''Quake'' still uses the client-server model, as opposed to the [[peer-to-peer]] networking used by some other games. ''Quake'' thus cannot suffer from de-synchronized network games that could occur from different clients disagreeing with each other, since the server is always the final authority.\n\n==Derivative engines==\n[[Image:Quake - family tree.svg|thumb|[[Family tree]] illustrating derivations of Quake engines (this graph was last updated in 2013)|alt=]]\n\nOn December 21, 1999, John Carmack of id Software released the ''Quake'' engine [[source code]] on the Internet under the terms of the GPL, allowing programmers to edit the engine and add new features. Programmers were soon releasing new versions of the engine on the net.

They toured the UK and continental Europe (Yugoslavia) and released a four singles during their existence, but are best-remembered for launching the career of [[Lemmy|Ian \"Lemmy\" Kilmister]] as his not first band but first professional band, then known as Ian Willis, who later was a member of [[Sam Gopal]], [[Opal Butterfly]] and [[Hawkwind]] and more famously founded [[Mot\u00f6rhead]].\n\nThey were originally called Rev Black and the Rockin' Vicars, then abbreviated to the Rockin' Vicars, but in order to have a chance to get more gigs or even a record contract, they changed their name to \"Rockin' Vickers\". Their last single \"[[Dandy (song)|Dandy]]\", a cover of [[the Kinks]] song, was produced by [[Shel Talmy]].\n\n==History==\nFormed in [[1963 in music|1963]], the band built their reputation as did many other [[beat group]]s of the era, by covering [[R&B]] and [[Beat music|Beat]] standards, but soon became known for their unusually intense live shows and outlandish stage costumes, dressing as [[vicar]]s and [[Sami people|Sami]]. Although mainly popular as a local act around [[Blackpool]], England, the Vicars also toured mainland Europe, being one of the earliest British rock bands to perform in a [[socialist]] country, when they played in [[Yugoslavia]] in the summer of 1965.<ref>[http://www.motorhead.ru/int20heavymetal.htm Interview with Lemmy Kilmister]</ref> They were particularly popular in [[Finland]], where they recorded a single, a rocked up version of [[Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart]]. They released four singles. The band split in [[1968 in music|1968]].<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/artist/Rocking+Vickers,+The?anv=Rockin'+Vickers&filter_anv=1  rOCKIN' vICKERS DISCOGRAPHY ON DISCOGS.COM]</ref> Lemmy played guitar with the band, same as in Sam Gopal, he later switched to bass guitar as his primary instrument with Hawkwind and M\u00f6torhead.\n \nIn 1967, expatriate Blackpool musician Dave Rossall (ex-Bruce & the Spiders), carrying on the tradition of the English band, formed his own Australian band called Rev Black and the Rockin' Vicars (1967\u20131969).

They toured the UK and continental Europe (Yugoslavia) and released a four singles during their existence, but are best-remembered for launching the career of [[Lemmy|Ian \"Lemmy\" Kilmister]] as his not first band but first profesional band, then known as Ian Willis, who later was a member of [[Sam Gopal]], [[Opal Butterfly]] and [[Hawkwind]] and more famously founded [[Mot\u00f6rhead]].\n\nThey were originally called Rev Black and the Rockin' Vicars, then abbreviated to the Rockin' Vicars, but in order to have a chance to get more gigs or even a record contract, they changed their name to \"Rockin' Vickers\". Their last single \"[[Dandy (song)|Dandy]]\", a cover of [[the Kinks]] song, was produced by [[Shel Talmy]].\n\n==History==\nFormed in [[1963 in music|1963]], the band built their reputation as did many other [[beat group]]s of the era, by covering [[R&B]] and [[Beat music|Beat]] standards, but soon became known for their unusually intense live shows and outlandish stage costumes, dressing as [[vicar]]s and [[Sami people|Sami]]. Although mainly popular as a local act around [[Blackpool]], England, the Vicars also toured mainland Europe, being one of the earliest British rock bands to perform in a [[socialist]] country, when they played in [[Yugoslavia]] in the summer of 1965.<ref>[http://www.motorhead.ru/int20heavymetal.htm Interview with Lemmy Kilmister]</ref> They were particularly popular in [[Finland]], where they recorded a single, a rocked up version of [[Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart]]. They released four singles. The band split in [[1968 in music|1968]].<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/artist/Rocking+Vickers,+The?anv=Rockin'+Vickers&filter_anv=1  rOCKIN' vICKERS DISCOGRAPHY ON DISCOGS.COM]</ref> Lemmy played guitar with the band, same as in Sam Gopal, he later switched to bass guitar as his primary instrument with Hawkwind and M\u00f6torhead.\n \nIn 1967, expatriate Blackpool musician Dave Rossall (ex-Bruce & the Spiders), carrying on the tradition of the English band, formed his own Australian band called Rev Black and the Rockin' Vicars (1967\u20131969). The Australian band went on to release four singles in its own right, toured extensively around Australia and made the Brisbane Top 40.\n\n==Members==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\"  style=\"float:width:375px; margin:0 0 1em 1em; border-collapse:collapse; border:1px solid #e2e2e2; width:99%;\"\n|-\n!  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#e7ebee; width:25%;\"| 1963\u20131964\n!  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#e7ebee; width:25%;\"| 1964\u20131965\n!  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#e7ebee; width:25%;\"| 1965\u20131967\n|-\n| valign=top |\n*'''Harry \"Reverend Black\" Feeney''' \u2013 vocals\n*'''Ken Hardacre''' \u2013 guitar\n*'''Alex Hamilton''' \u2013 guitar\n*'''Peter Moorhouse''' \u2013 bass\n*'''Cyril \"Ciggy\" Shaw''' \u2013 drums\n| valign=top |\n*'''Harry \"Reverend Black\" Feeney''' \u2013 vocals\n*'''Nicholas Gribbon''' \u2013 guitar\n*'''Ian Holdbrook''' \u2013 guitar/harmonica\n*'''Stephen \"Mogsy\" Morris''' \u2013 bass\n*'''Cyril \"Ciggy\" Shaw''' \u2013 drums\n| valign=top |\n*'''Harry \"Reverend Black\" Feeney''' \u2013 vocals\n*'''[[Lemmy|Ian \"Lemmy\" Kilmister]]''' \u2013 guitar\n*'''Garry Chamberlain'''- guitar\n*'''Stephen \"Mogsy\" Morris''' \u2013 bass\n*'''Cyril \"Ciggy\" Shaw''' \u2013 drums\n|-\n|}\n\n==Discography==\n===Singles===\n*\"I Go Ape\" b/w \"Someone Like You\", [[Decca Records|Decca]] F 11993, 1964, UK\n*\"Stella\" b/w \"[[Zing!
